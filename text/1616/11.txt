here are a million reasons
for you to volunteer, but
with Connect there’s only
one. We take students
to St Mary’s hospital, where many
elderly patients are bed-bound with
no one to visit, no one to talk to.
Our role is to teach you the lost
art of listening. These patients host
myriads of stories, woven through
both world wars,the blitz,rationing,
and surviving huge cultural shifts.
The elderly make up the majority
of hospital inpatients, but they are
also one of the most vulnerable to
social isolation and depression.
Our visits provide important social
support for these lonely individuals
who may otherwise have very few
they can confide in.
Doctors and nurses, despite
their best intentions, simply do
not have enough time or resources
to be able to spend an extended
amount of time with individual
patients. Our volunteering not
only improves patient experience,
but through conversation you may
also find useful information which
healthcare professionals can use to
better patient care.
The aim of our society is to
improve the quality of life and
recovery of elderly patients by
reducing depression caused by social
isolation. You will be in a team of 6
led by an experienced team leader
that will guide you through the
wards of St Mary’s hospital. You’ll
learn valuable communication skills,
have exposure in a clinical setting
and, most importantly, be part of a
close-knit community of volunteers
who share the same goal – to help
others.
There are a million reasons for
you to volunteer, but with Connect
there’s only one: to connect.
If you would like to join the
connect family do not hesitate to
contact us. Sign up this week and
come along for our £7 ice skating
social (free drink included) at
the Natural History Museum on
Monday 16th
November. We’d be that happy too if we had that much pizza. Photo Credit: Kien Nguyen

or those that don’t already
know, on the first Monday
of every month Nice N’
Spikey Comedy throws a
handful of professional comedians
into the Union Bar alongside our
very own comedians from Imperial
Comedy. Following on from
the superb spectacle last month,
this month saw a new host of
professional and amateur stand ups.
The evening began with host and
compère Sion James who engaged
in light banter attempting to warm
up the small crowd huddled near the
stage. He then introduced the first
act of the night American comedian
Russell Hicks who underwhelmed
the audience with general chat and
talk, straying from his routine on
several occasions to interact with
the room. Following on from him
Tom Hicks took centre stage to
try out some new material, with
a notepad and pen he guided the
onlookers through a few of his good
(and bad) ideas. Leaving the stage
with the knowledge that Swiss army
knives are funny.
Then, the moment everyone
had been waiting for, Imperial
born and bred comedian Josh
Carr made his way through the

Funny and
cringe-
worthy
crowd, clipboard in hand, up to
the stage. His character of a nerdy
college professor suited his geeky
demeanour and unsurprisingly
related to the Imperial crowd. Josh
told a story of his childhood and
adolescence, as well as his early
manhood. Cracking up the crowd
with funny and cringe-worthy
tales in a self-deprecating manner.
Finishing off with his Riddler
audition and a theory about black
holes, it was time for the interval.
After the interval Imperial
Comedy’s very own president Arran
Hobson Sayers bounded to the
stage for a surprise set, delighting
the hard-core comedy goers with
snappy jokes and a stylistically
unique presentation of safety signs.
Headliner Stuart Goldsmith then
grabbed the audience’s attention
with a hilarious account of his
impending parenthood and his
theories about babies. He then
launched into a laughter ridden
chronicle of mattocks ending the
night with a roar, undeniably a
comedian to watch out for.
Nice N’ Spikey hosts stand-up
comedy nights every month in the
union bar, the next one will be on
Monday 7th
of December so come
and check out some of Imperial’s
finest comic talent.

n 1956, the widows of the
Susan B. Anthony Society
for the Sisters of Gertrude
Stein meet in a renovated
community centre for their annual
breakfast, where the prize-winning
quiche will be declared in a much-
anticipated ceremony. The sudden
threat of an atomic bomb forces
the women in this idyllic American
town to begin sharing their deepest
secrets, which lead to some not-
so-shocking confessions from the
society’s leaders.
I went to a comedy gig recently
where one performer opined that
“the problem with football fans is
they think that watching 100s of
hours of something makes them
an expert. If that were really true,
I would be the best lesbian lover in
the world.”
Was he referring to Imperial
College DramSoc’s production of
“Five Lesbians Eating a Quiche”
(FLEQ), directed by Elena Stein?
Probably not,but that’s his loss.This
was a show that took a superb script
and brought it to life through a
combination of quality production,
immersive audience interaction and
most importantly an excellently
cast group of actresses who left me
questioning my distaste for quiche.
The show opens with the five
members of the Susan B. Anthony
Society entering from the rear of
the Union Concert Hall, who talk
to the audience as they walk towards
the stage.Some of those approached
looked quite terrified, though
whether this was because of the
surprise of being spoken to during
a play or because Imperial students
in general are frightened of social
interaction was unclear. Regardless,
it was a unique start that could have
quite easily gone wrong, but rather
demonstrated immediately that the
actresses didn’t feel constrained or
rigid and robotic in their assumed
characters, but rather composed
and fluid. From the moment they
assume the stage, we as an audience
are under the impression we are
witnessing an event far greater than
any of us: the unveiling of the prize
winning quiche.
Our immersion in this 50’s cold
war setting is amplified by Amanda
Williamson’s set. The Wall of Past
Presidents of the society looms
tall above the 5 senior members
(the audience are given name tags
and treated as lesser members
throughout), whilst the gawkish
and repugnant wallpaper will seem
familiar to those who lived in
these times/Fisher Hall. The only
moment it really falls short is when
a door described as being “military
grade” and “radiation proof” is
slammed shut only for it to shake
and nearly fall off its hinges. The
lighting (Elena Stronach) is spot
on throughout, contributing one of
the show’s biggest laughs, and the
sound design (Robert Schüssler) is
professional and well executed
What makes this show truly
memorable, however, is the quality
of the acting. Acting is like cooking;
you don’t need to know anything
about how it’s done to appreciate
it when it’s performed well. This is
a good thing, otherwise I wouldn’t
be able to write this review. When
“Dale” (Olivia Gatliff) is killed by
radiation (if you cared so much about
spoilers you would have bothered to
watch the play, you philistine), the
We wonder if they’ll ever be able to eat quiche again. Photo Credit: Chads Chadwick

DramSoc wows with first show of the year
Watching lesbians has never been so much fun
fact that I feel sad is an achievement.
The fact that, despite this whole
play being absurdist, satirical and
fundamentally comedic, I still
feel a pang of grief, I still feel the
reverberation of this blackly comic

death bounce across the room
and I still hope she managed to
survive is indicative of a truly
excellent exhibition of acting by
this cast. That effect is an inevitable
outcome of a number of things.
The constant undercurrent of
sycophancy that intentionally fails
to mask the thick air of bitchiness
amongst our strangely caricatured
yet somewhat relatable characters
does so much to make them feel
real. That takes both a skilled cast
and a director with real vision to
achieve. The unerring finesse of
the accents transports us across the
Atlantic with ease, and the dialogue
is brilliant. Not since the days of
my old all-boys school have I seen
sexual innuendo so wonderfully and
creatively delivered. It’s sharp and
zippy, with pauses and punchlines
timed to perfection. The withering
and barely veiled insults thrown
around the room (and indeed the
audience) by Lulie (Anisha Kadri)
and Vern (Lucy Luo) are as barbed
and cutting as the playwrights
would have wanted them to be.
Aliya Ismailova’s portrayal of
Ginny wouldn’t have been quite as
convincing without her authentic
Mancunian accent, which serves
both to contrast against the brusque
American twangs of the other
members, but also as a reminder of
just how awful many northerners
sound. So said the pretend critic
from Birmingham.
Would it be hyperbolic to say this
was the best play I’ve seen at IC
since I arrived two years ago? It’s
difficult to say, but that in itself is
testament to how wonderful this
production was.
