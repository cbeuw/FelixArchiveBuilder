CANCER
VIRGO
This week one of your friends
decides to buy a black light
and barges into your room
only to be blinded with
the power of a thousand
suns. The remainder of your
student loan is used to pay
them compensation. You
should probably find a better
way to dispose of your used
tissues.

This week following the
Israeli university boycott by
three academics at Imperial,
you decide to boycott the
Library Café. The loss of
sales of jacket potatoes send
Imperial into bankruptcy,
but at least we all get a nice
holiday.
This week, your business
ethics course is sponsored
by Shell. Actually not a joke,
they genuinely are.
This week you realize that
Jeremy Hunt will probably
never sort out the junior
doctor contracts so you give
up on medicine and decide
to become a banker instead.
At least Jeremy will definitely
listen to you now.
This week you are a tree in
Beit Quad. After peacefully
going about your existence
for thousands of years, you
are ruthlessly cut down in a
politically motivated attack
by the union. Your scattered
entrails decorate the FELIX
office.
This week due to a lack of
money coming your way, you
decide to sublet your ensuite
bathroom to a 60 year old
man. He’s very nice and
regular with the payments
but you wish he would stop
slaughtering chickens when
you’re sleeping.
This week you are the Home
Secretary. In an attempt to
spy on your husband’s porn
viewing habits, you try to
force all internet companies
to keep a record of their
customers history for twelve
months, only to discover
that he routes all his traffic
through an Estonian proxy.
This week you are still
suffering from the misjudged
Halloween outfit you wore
out to that mad party in
Metric, and still many of
your friends won’t talk to you
afterwards. You conclude the
world probably isn’t ready for
a [CENSORED] costume
yet.
This week you excitedly tune
in to University Challenge
so you can see how amazing
Imperial is against the rest of
the UK; however, I’m really
sick of getting Facebook
invites so you should all know
that they [REDACTED].
Like, seriously.
This week you declare a
vendetta against Cadbury’s
after you realize that they
have started to put sultanas
in the Fruit and Nut recipe;
however, your Google
searches for “how 2 blo up
cadbrrys” are detected by
Imperial and your print
credit is taken away.
This week you have had
enough of Imperial and
decide to dig a tunnel back
home using the plastic
spoons you get from the
Library Café; however
you take a wrong turn and
stumble across Chris Kaye’s
underground lair. You enjoy
some fresh pizza bases with
Chris.
This week you decide to
join the Imperial bloc at the
student protests; however,
you soon lose sight of the
ten other Imperial students
taking part and are absorbed
by the nefarious ‘black bloc.’
In your rage against the
bourgeoisie, you are kettled
for twelve hours and miss
three coursework deadlines.
