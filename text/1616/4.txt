competition, held this
year’s finals at St James’s
Palace on Tuesday, with Imperial
entrepreneurs taking home both
first and third place.

startup came top, with Baby
LifeBox, a low-cost baby incubator,
taking third position.
Founded by Imperial alumni
Hal Watts and Ben Alun-Jones,
alongside RCA alumnus Kirsty
Emery,Unmade (formerly Knyttan)
created software that allows clients
to digitally design knitwear and
produce them on demand, “turning
knitting machines into effectively
3D printers for clothes”, according
to Watts.
Currently based at Somerset
House,with three knitting machines
and 22 members of staff, Unmade
aims to change the fact that “clothes
are designed for everyone and made
for no-one” through their software,

FELIX can now exclusively reveal that Fred was our secret Phoenix cover star back in issue 1600.

subsidiary of
FELIX until
the union
withdrew the
magazine’s
funding
FELIX writer and I, Science up for awards
T
he shortlist for The
Guardian’s Student
Media Awards this year
includes FELIX’s very
own film editor, Fred Fyles, and the
Imperial student-run publication I,
Science.
Fyles, a medic, is up for the
‘Features writer of the Year’ prize,
after judges enjoyed several of his
infamous long-reads, including
‘FKA Twigs, Feminism and Female
Sexuality on Video’ and ‘Women.
Music. Power: A Century of Female
Electronica’.
He has also co-edited Phoenix,
FELIX’s termly arts publication,
whilst contributing a colossal
amount of content to the newspaper
on a weekly basis.
I, Science was a subsidiary of
FELIX, until the union withdrew
the magazine’s funding at the end
of last year. It’s now run through
the Science Communication
department, as the majority of the
magazine’s writers and editorial
team are on one of these courses.
FELIX last won the coveted
‘Publication of the Year’ prize way
back in 2008, when Tom Roberts
was Editor-in-Chief. Roberts’paper
produced some legendary front
covers, including an issue with a
completely blank front page, save
for an emboldened and ominous:
“Normally FELIX informs
students on the issues that affect
them; this week we report on why
we cannot publish everything that
we know”.
The cat logo was gagged, as the
union had that week prohibited
them from reporting several stories

The Guardian’s Student Media Awards shortlist includes two Imperial entries
believed affected students.
The winners are announced at
an awards ceremony on the 1st
of December. Judges include The
Guardian’s new editor, Katharine
Viner, and representatives from The
Evening Standard, The Times and
VICE.
Category winners receive two
weeks work experience at The
Guardian and a place on their
‘masterclass on journalism’ course.
Runners up receive a week of work
experience.
while also tackling the morally
dubious use of cheap labour in the
production process.
The other Imperial success story,
Baby LifeBox, was created by
current student Malav Sanghavi,
and provides basic facilities for
babies in their first days of life, such
as “warmth, monitoring and a germ
free environment.”
Designed for use in developing
countries, the incubator is made
from cardboard,with its bottom half
also functioning as a make-shift cot.
Shanghavi also received a £500
grant from Imperial College
Advance Hackspace prior to
Pitch@Palace, intended to help him
develop his prototype incubator.
Imperial has responded positively
to the news, with Professor
David Gann, Vice President
(Development and Innovation),
commenting that “both Unmade
and Baby LifeBox exemplify the
spirit of entrepreneurship we prize
at Imperial,” and extending an offer
to all Pitch@Palace participants
to “locate with us” at Imperial’s
recently re-branded White City
Campus.
The second-placed company
on the night was Appear Here,
a startup which enables pop-up
shops to locate available spaces
across London. Other runners
up included Toothscan, which
can identify dental issues early
on in development, Polysolar, an
alternative system of solar panels,
and Yellowdog, a crowd-sourced
render farm intended to provide
3D animators with easy, cheap
processing power.
The bootcamp stage of the
competition took place on Queen’s
Lawn several weeks ago,with Prince
Andrew in attendance. Two weeks
later he was back at Imperial, with
China’s President Xi.

eggs and letting off smoke
bombs outside the building. The
department is in charge of higher
education.
Although the Metropolitan Police
denied using the controversial
‘kettling’ technique to control the
crowds, some videos have surfaced
on social media of students
surrounded by police officers
on every side, being ‘escorted’ to
Charing Cross Station.
With a union Sabbatical officer
in their ranks, the Imperial bloc
marched from Malet Street, near
UCL, to Parliament, via Trafalgar
Square, Downing Street and the
Home Office.
Rounds of ‘NO IFS, NO BUTS,
NO EDUCATION CUTS’ and
‘WHAT DO WE WANT? FREE
EDUCATION! WHEN DO WE
WANT IT? NOW!’
At one point there was whisper
that our very own union president
would make an appearance,however
she didn’t manage to make it.
When fees faced their last round
of increases in 2010, the union
president at the time, Andrew
Kendall, did not attend student
protests either,and spoke out against
the demonstrations in FELIX.
Although only around 15 Imperial
students attended the demo, after
the medic protests of the past few
weeks, it’s turning into quite a term
for Imperial dissidence.
