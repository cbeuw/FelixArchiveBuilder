Get involved in making your student experience the best it
can be.
Rep Week is your chance to help shape the year ahead in your department.
Your Reps will be out and about within your department, or you can contact
them online and tell them what you would like changed within your
department.
We’ll also be using Rep Week to acknowledge and celebrate the hard work of
our Reps and what they have achieved to make your department and courses
better.

We are a vibrant and dynamic charity with a bright future – but we are never
complacent and are always looking for ways to improve and to better serve our
members: the students of Imperial College London. A strong and active Board
of Trustees is essential for us as we endeavour to build on recent successes
and continue to move forward.
