ARTS
A physicist who likes art? Bah!
Ben Williams
Writer
Get off your high horse and stop thinking science is too good for art
S
o here’s my exhibition label.
Neat card,kind of heavy.Flat
blue type, rather charming:
“PHYSICIST MEETS
ART”. “Sheesh”,you say,“I thought
they allowed children in these
places.” Luckily for you and I times
have changed. I’ll tell you straight:
this love is not the sin against
science that they’d have you believe.
It seems pretty simple to me. Art
is the set of ideas that people can
try to express. Science is the set of
those ideas that we can test. Happy?
Good. So all scientists are artists?
“Fuck off!” I hear you shout. Yet,
there is, from any logical, sane
standpoint no contradiction.
You see, art –that whale of a
word – isn’t in the definition of the
brushstrokes of dead men. Pages
subconscious. The route it takes
there is pretty irrelevant.
Yet still, we have that stale old lie,
lingering in the corners between the
library café’s pigeon-chewed sofas
and curling itself around my pint in
the union. “Science”, you will snarl,
pipe in hand,eyebrow talking “is not
art.”
So say the wise and worldy
‘practical people’. You’ll read this
while poncing about and puff up like
fat red bullfrogs: “Croak! Where’s
me meat and three veg? Croak! This
ain’t gonna pay no bills, buddy!”
No,it ain’t mate.But this repressed
‘Mr Nuts and Bolts’ attitude is
cowardice – a dodge.It’s a thick grey
blobby wall, not a solution. That
voodoo statement is, nine times
out of ten, as much about deluding
ourselves into applying a series of
fake absolutes, as dealing with the
world as it is.
Comfortable, maybe, but I’m still
naive enough to believe it’s the truth
that we really care about. I mean,
when you say this ‘high’ talk of art
isn’t real, what’s your goddamm
‘real’? Vodka and beans?
Art might not look like vodka
and beans, sure, but then vodka and
beans look a hell of a lot like you,
given the right perspective. Your
vodka and beans are, in the history
of the planet, quite a terrifying
revolution.That is an objective truth
– or at least as much as any scientist
can ask for.
Like it or not eyebrow wielder,
what we’re doing here isn’t building
somekindofcutesy1950’sbungalow.
It’s not about walls. Einstein wasn’t
a stay-at-home dad, and Noether
isn’t in the kitchen making meatloaf.
The beautiful, crazy thing that we
find is that there are almost no
absolutes. There are very, very, very
few things that we can know for
certain, if anything. That, painful as
it may be, is absolutely beautiful in
the way we find the limits of what
we imagine, and what we can make
are so blazingly close. Imperial was
born on challenge and change, and
we have a responsibility to see the
world as wooly and wild as it is, not
from some shivering little Victorian
fear of ‘containment’.
The terrifying thing about the
‘grey blob’ – the little voice that
says it’s okay just to be another
calculating sausage, is that is breeds
deadbeat apathy.
I mean it’s common knowledge
that Imperial is a dead duck, right?
Why bother trying? Why bother
fighting? We don’t do ‘change’. We
can’t compete. The college hates us

E
zra Pound’s poetry is
poised to rejuvenate the
modern reader due to his
literal sense of audience,
appealing to “a community of
readers and writers, existing across
time…a trans-historical community
of artists.”(Prof. Langdon Hammer,
Yale University, 2012). It is this
delocalization that will allow his
poems to endure. While at times
hermetically difficult, steeped in
contemporary vernacular, their
language allows immediate access in
its variety. One hesitates to advocate
escapism, however much modern
times may encourage it.
Yet, as Pound writes in ‘The
Object’:
This thing, that hath a code and
not a core,
Hath set acquaintance where
might be affections,
And nothing now
Disturbeth his reflections.
In an era of gross consumerism,
when the notion of duty and the
value of obligation, tradition and
lineage are a shadow of their former
selves, poets of tradition (such as
T.S Eliot) face castigation from
mass readership. Pound’s own
journey from America to Europe,
now a century ago, was in itself the
fleeing of cultural commodity. If
this anathema was woven into the
poet’s resolve, one might argue that
it is manifest in the poetry, allowing
it to endure.
One might posit that it is the
driving force behind Pound’s poetic
‘impulse’, as demonstrated in ‘The
Seafarer’:
Bitter-breast cares have I abided,
Known on my keel many a care’s
hand.
And dire sea-surge, and there oft
spent
Narrow nightwatch night the
ship’s head
While she tossed close to cliffs.
In the early twentieth century, the
poem was an avant garde mapping
of the Anglo-Saxon vernacular
into modern English. Its rough
metre and daring use of plosive
give weight and life to its nautical
imagery. In parodying the old
English alliterative verse, whereby
poems are synchronized by stress
count rather than metric feet, the
speaker’s voice is given vitality. It
fulfills Pound’s historical mission
to “make it new” (Hammer, 2012).
It has enough weight to be heard
amidst the modern trivial din.
The image of journey transcends
the oceans, becoming a ‘crossing
over’ in time and space: a surrender.
Another strength of Pound’s poetry
is that it employs secular means to
engender inspiration. While the
poet was experimentalist, he was
also a pedantic scholar, his work
become an option?
Normally, I hate the kind of goof
who quotes Feynman (as quotes
go, he’s the Physicists equivalent of
Aunty Ethel), but he puts down the
challenge pretty elegantly:
“For far more marvelous is the truth
than any artists of the past imagined
it. Why do the poets of the present
not speak of it? What men are poets
who can speak of Jupiter if he were
a man, but if he is an immense
spinning sphere of methane and
ammonia must be silent?”
But I’d flip this. We are meant
to keep the flame alive. College is
taking this super seriously – if you’ve
checked out the temperature of the
computing labs on howhotislabs.com
recently, you’ll see we’re well on the
way to officially being ‘on fire’.
Of course, it is the sad reality of
this stubborn world that not all
of you will be hit by your artistic
epiphany, but do me one favour:
stop thinking of arts as a dirty
word. The arts aren’t some hidden,
forbidden thing. As students, and
“Science”,

talking “is

of black dots on dead trees is not a

Equally, it’d be idiotic to worship
the paper on which Einstein wrote
the first metric tensor, or to think of
Newtonian mechanics as Newton’s
equations.These are much like a bra:
they provide support, but it’s what’s
inside that counts.It is the idea itself
that matters, not the wrapping.
The point is that the measure of
the power of any kind of work (and
I’d call Dirac an artist, as much
as Picasso) is fundamentally in
the conversation it can have – the
perspective it can push into your

we’re screwed anyhow. Can we be
proud of that kind of culture? Is
that really what we are here for?

steeped in form, in order to channel
that aforementioned ‘impulse’.
He regarded the literature of the
past as sacred. Akin to language,
the past spawns derivation: Pound
makes the past the present, made
“continuously available for those
who can recognize it…technical
powers…achieve immediacy.”
(Hammer, 2012)
I conclude by expressing my love
of Pound’s ‘impulse’, his kernel. In
a world of competition, where one
The Poetry of Ezra Pound
An Anchor for the Modern Reader
Eoghan Totten
Writer
writes this very article on a whim at
eight o’clock in the morning (close
to a printing deadline and wedged
between breakfast and class), where
there is little room for cohesion and
poise in man’s life, it is imperative
that he make room for the past.
Where value was conferred by and
transmitted in every breath, today,
it is laughed at, scorned. For an
instant, pick up Pound, surrender
yourself to phanopoeia, to language,
to the immediacy of the past. It is
apt that Ezra Pound writes in ‘La
Fraisne’ that:
I have put aside all folly and all
grief.
I wrapped my tears in an ellum
leaf
And left them under a stone
And now men call me mad
because I have thrown
All folly from me,putting it aside
To leave the old barren ways of
men.
