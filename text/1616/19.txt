The triumphant return of Guitar Hero
U
ntil recently, the
click-clack of plastic
peripherals felt like a
distant memory. Yet,
only five years have passed since
the death of the rhythm gaming
industry. From billions to almost
nothing, in 2010 Activision could
do nothing as one of their most
lucrative franchises melted away.
To observers, this came as no
surprise. A saturated market and
consumers’ increasing negativity
towardexpensiveplasticinstruments
made the downfall of the genre all
but inevitable.
From its beginnings in 2005,
Guitar Hero grew from a guitar
based rhythm game to a full band
experience. During this time Rock
Band proved a formidable rival,
offering a vast online catalogue
of songs and a large variety of
instruments.
Harmonix hoped to survive the
downturn with the release of Rock
Band 3. Advertised as a platform to
purchase music, they promised to
continue supporting the title with
new content long into the future,
but, by 2013 the release of regular
DLC was discontinued.
One of Activision’s last attempts to
revitalise the franchise,in the release
of DJ Hero, saw critical acclaim
and also introduced the world to
FreeStyleGames who would later
go on to develop Guitar Hero Live.
Offering a wide selection of musical
genres and interesting gameplay
mechanics, it proved that there
was space left in rhythm gaming to
innovate.
Five years later and we’re
beginning to see the future that it
promised.
Guitar Hero Live’s announcement
earlier this year surprised many
when it was revealed that the game
would replace the series’ semi-
cartoonish 3D graphics with high
definition FMVs (full motion
video).
Today, it’s rare to see FMVs in
such high profile games; they offer

limited interactivity in a time when
consumers want deep and engaging
worlds.
For rhythm games, the
background has always been
secondary. In resurrecting the
franchise, FreeStyleGames could
have made the decision to render
the entire crowd at runtime, a task
which modern consoles might
have struggled with. Instead, their
use of reactive FMVs has allowed
the studio to create highly realistic
graphics on a (probably) relatively
small budget.
It perfectly emulates the
experience of being a musician and
the ability of the public to suddenly
satisfying. With the new button
layout, the developers were able to
introduce bar chords and other more
complex combinations. The added
challenge might put off newcomers,
but it’s easily the closest you’ll get to
playing a real guitar with a plastic
instrument.
TV mode is arguably the game’s
most innovative feature. In the past,
to unlock new content Guitar Hero
and Rock Band required you to
purchase music on their in-game
stores.
With Live, you can tune into a 24
hour streaming channel where you’ll
be able to compete with other users
in real-time. Two channels offer
different genre based shows (from
Indie hits to Metal classics) with
brief intermissions that shamelessly
imitate MTV.
The full catalogue of songs from
both channels is available at all
times and if there’s a song you want
to play again you can pay (with real
or in-game money).This new model
of video game consumption reflects
the music industry’s move away
from ownership. Luckily, the vast
amount of replayability that comes
with it is well worth the sacrifice.
While previous games only offered
evolutionary changes, Guitar Hero
Live is the first revolutionary release
in the franchise. It’s a rhythm game
for the Netflix generation, offering
nearly unlimited content.
