Charges dropped for #killallwhite men tweet
B
ahar Mustafa,the diversity
sabbatical officer from
Goldsmith’s university
who was due to appear
in court for tweeting the phrase
#killallwhitemen, has had the
charges against her dropped. She
had been charged for sending a
“threatening or grossly offensive
message”from her personal account.
This decision was made public
only days before Mustafa was due
to appear in Bromley Magistrates’
Court.The CPS said it was down to
there being “not enough evidence”.
Her lawyer said the decision
“[called] into question their ability
to make sensible judgments on
delicate issues”.
After asking white men not to
attend an event at her university
for minority ethnic and non-binary
people, a petition was launched by
someone, who is not a student at
Goldsmiths, to both sack her and
revoke her degree. The petition
attracted more than 27,000
signatures from the public, although
an internal petition did not receive
enough signatures to hold a
Goldsmiths-wide referendum on
whether she should remain in the
post.
In the media storm that followed
this incident, her social media
accounts were examined by the press,
with both the #killallwhitemen
tweet and a photograph of her
next to a drawing depicting ‘white
male tears’ coming to light. In the
aftermath, she received death and
rape threats, but no charges were
made against those who sent these
messages.
A video was also released of Bahar
speaking about the incident where Imagine if one of our Sabbs was this controversial. FELIX can dream.

Union replaces tree in Beit Quad
O
ne of the two large,
established cherry trees
dominating Beit quad
has been completely
removed, and replaced with a
younger model. Many readers will
be familiar with the trees’ knobbly
roots which have lifted the paving
around the union’s seating area,
forming a trip hazard.
The combination of drunk
students and un-level paving
led the union to ask the council
whether the trees could be removed.
Westminster council’s tree officer
recently granted permission for this,
having visited the site and reporting
that both trees were diseased.
Beit and the union building are
situated in Westminster council’s
Knightsbridge conservation area,
which means although it is privately
owned land belonging to the
college, the trees are protected by
Westminster council, and requests
to have them removed are subject to
approval by the council.
Westminster’s arboricultural
officer, Rosie Dobson, inspected
them and found decay fungus and
cankers in the main branches of
both trees. Ms Dobson told FELIX
these defects had left the trees’ life
expectancies reduced and so she had
no objection to them being removed
and exchanged for an “attractive and
hardy” new species.
The two cherry trees are being
replaced by Robinia Casque Rouges,
which have roots that spread less,
grow quickly and branch higher up.
The first new Robinia was planted
on Wednesday, and is thoroughly
weedy in comparison to its cherry
counterpart. The workers planting
it expressed worry as to whether the
young tree would survive its first
sports night. It did.
The second tree is due to be
removed in the coming week, and
by next Friday, the surrounding
pavement will have been re-layed.
On Tuesday, chainsaws were heard
echoing across the quad, while

Editor-in-Chief
It’s been tripping you up for years, and now it’s gone forever
The CPS
said it was
down to
there being
“not enough
evidence”
its branches.By midday,the tree was
gone.
FELIX was delivered part of the
trunk from a disgruntled student. It
is unclear where the rest of the tree
is, or how it will be recycled.
The roots of the trees have made
the fuse boxes outside inaccessible,
rendering both the fairy lights in
the trees and the round lights on the
ground unusable.
Chris Kaye, the union’s Deputy
President for Finance and Services,
told us:
“The old tree has seen the ups
and downs of student life over its
many years, a bit like me. It has seen
many bodily fluids. It has seen many
commiseratory (sic) pints, many
celebratory pints. It has seen people
at Freshers’ week and at graduation.
The tree has come to the end of
its life but it is being replaced by a
new tree. A tree that will see many
many more generations of Imperial
students. And I wish it all the best.”
she described how, as an ethnic
minority woman in a civilisation set
up to benefit white males, she could
not be racist or sexist.
Mustafa had also called someone
“white trash” from the Goldsmiths
Student Union Welfare and
Diversity Officer’s official Twitter
account, which she later said had
been unprofessional.
