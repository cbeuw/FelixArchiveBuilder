I
mperial hosted Kings’ Medics
at Harlington, looking for
a win to bounce back from
a disappointing defeat last
week. IC got off to a bright start,
dominating possession, territory
and hitting hard in the contact.
However, errors crept in at crucial
stages, allowing the unspoilt Kings’
tryline to somehow remain intact.
After 25 minutes all the home side
had to show for their dominance was
a single penalty from resident South
African, Charles “I can’t remember
that Japan game” Price-Smith.
The team had also taken a
devastating casualty with the loss
of Tom Hedley to a broken rib.
The team wept, but through their
tears they could see victory on the
horizon. As the half moved on,
a couple of infringements gave
the medics a bit of territory in
the imperial half. Kings managed
to work an overlap and send the
winger in some space down their
left hand side.
With the ultra reliable Billy
Sixtrees deciding to take a ten-
minute breather (having spent the
rest of the half slicing through the
Kings defence),we were left without
a natural full back,and Kings scored
in the corner,giving them a 5-3 lead
going into the break.
However, it didn’t take Imperial
long to regain the advantage after
half time.
A few strong phases of play
sucked the away defence in tight,
and Charles sent Captain, and
all round top bloke who does not
ball down for a score, with the extra
2 added from the boot of Price-
Smith.
After this breakthrough, IC never
looked back, playing together with
far more cohesion and confidence.
Good pressure at the lineout from
Ali Zaboronsky forced the ball
loose, sending author of this article,
David Nielsen-Scott scything
through the line like a faster and
more handsome Bryan Habana. A
simple pop to recently converted
rower, Hugh Wilman got him over
the line.
In this act, row row rower, Hugh
managed in his first start something
that has evaded housemate Tom
Hobson for over three years, and
he did not forget to scream about it
in the bar later. With this Imperial
were firmly in the ascendency at 15-
5.
From the resulting kick off,
Nathan Tomlinson got his tree
trunks rolling and dragged four
King’s defenders 15 metres up the
pitch. Hard carries from Moorby
and Clayton blasted IC up the
pitch. A small knock on from kings
gave IC a scrum in a good attacking
position. A slick scrum move,
starting with Zaboronsky,sent DNS
into space again. Good support
from Ed Durkin saw the electric
scrum half zip in underneath the
posts, with CPS adding the extras.
Not content with this, IC went in
search of the 4 try bonus point. A
powerful maul got Wilman within
centimeters from doubling his tally
for the day, but fortunately fresher
James Field was on hand to grab his
first score in IC colors, and to bring
all 5 points back to ACC, with the
final score 27-5.

Immortal no more: Lions take the glory
A
fter a successful
scrimmage last Saturday,
the Immortals travelled
up to Birmingham for
their season opener against the
University of Birmingham Lions.
After the disappointing loss from
last year against the 5-time national
champions, we were unable to turn
the tables around and were beaten
by 47-0.The first quarter started out
poorly for both defence and offense,
with the defensive team conceding
early on in the game and the offense
struggling to create chances to rush
down field or complete passes.
Having many starters either
injured or unable to play, the
Immortals lacked fresh faces on the
field and were unable to make big
differences in the second quarter
ending the first half with the score
of 41-0 to the Lions.
There was a lot of frustration
during half time, however with the
experience of the returning veterans
and our new head coach, the team’s
morale was lifted at the end of the
break and the players came out
to start the second half strongly.
Defence overall were looking much
more solid relative to the first half,
with the defensive line and the
linebackers reducing the Lion’s
offensive advancement compared to
the previous half and the defensive
backs improved on coverage and
with Aidan ‘The Hulk’Bohill having
a chance to intercept the ball.
Offensively, the Immortal’s o-line
had much more success with pass
protection; opening up many
more chances for our Quarterback
to complete passes. The second

half ended with the Immortals
conceding once in the final seconds
of the match adding 6 more points
closing the game.
Despite a disappointing result,
there were many positives to take
into account especially in the second
half.
Our defensive MVPs this week
are: Matt ‘has had enough’ Blackett
– defensive rookie MVP for fighting
throughout the game making
essential tackles and all defensive
linemen – overall defensive MVP
Immortals
lacked fresh
faces on
the field and
were unable
to make big
differences in
the second
quarter
for holding their ground causing
trouble for the opposing running
backs.
Our offensive MVPs are the
following: Handsome Dan
Grumberg – offensive rookie MVP
for showing a consistently strong
performance throughout the match
and Marcus ‘MSH big bush’ Stead-
Hall – overall offensive MVP for
many great plays, most notably
taking the ball on a fall back dive
and generally, throwing out many
great cut blocks.
The overall MVP was Markus ‘the
gigantic-headed’ Mohr for making
more than a few above average plays
and for playing his heart out on
both defence and offense.
Lastly, Nigvi ‘Rufio’ Tam received
the new iron man award for playing
restlessly both ways. The Immortals
now take these experiences forward
to their training sessions during
the 3-week break in the hopes of
improving as a team before facing
the Bath Killer Bees on Sunday the
22nd
of November.
With many starters unable to play, Immortals were disadvantaged from the off. Photo Credit: Immortals Publicity
