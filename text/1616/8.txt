f you pick up the Metro this
week, what are the headlines?
Let me guess, the rugby no
doubt? But move across the
Indian Ocean, from a country in
merriment of its victories, to a
country burning in its own eco-
apocalypse. Indonesia burns and
headlines turn away!
It represents the “greatest
environmental disaster of the 21st
century – so far” according to
George Monbiot, columnist of the
Guardian. Of course, we all would
much rather channel hop when the
news briefs on such disheartening
reports. But ignorance does nothing
for those being evacuated in war-
ships, choking under a thick ochre
blanket, and the species burning at
the hands of human greed.
5,000km of the continent is up
in flames, so why are we reading
headlines such as “Cancer causing
Sausage Baps?” We are looking at
the wrong BBQ.
Indonesia is a monopolist of the
palm oil industry; with acres and
acres of the land scared, stripped
bare of its natural forestry, turning
it into products such as Colgate
and peanut butter. The industry has
provided employment, producing
the most productive form of oil.
But it has also broken bonds in
a complex natural system that
previously harvested the greatest
quantity of the world’s biodiversity.
Now, only two species dominate:
the oil palm and humans.
But like the ticking metronomes
of the machines working the land,
time is an adversary to this industry.
Yes, it is an industry which supports
this developing country financially.
As such, Indonesia’s government
has prohibited restraints of some

companies to stop deforestation
due to consumer desire. But it’s an
industry which has burnt itself out.
Unsustainable practice, leading to
forest fires on an unprecedented
scale, has cost the Indonesia
economy $30 billion.
Wild-fires, due to land clearance
and habitat fragmentation, in
an extreme El Nino year were
inevitable. The fires have released
more C02 in three weeks than
the annual emissions of Germany.
Contributions to greenhouse gas
emissions only proliferate under
a positive feedback loop. As the
forests burn, the land also burns.
Burning peat releases plumes of
carbon monoxide, ozone, methane
and other exotic gases.These plumes
5000 km
of the
continent is
up in flames
swell for miles, crossing borders.
Wild fires assistance to climate
change will result in more, well,
wild fires. We have indeed entered
an unforgiving vortex.
Flickers of extinction plague the
future of many of Indonesia’s forest-
dwelling species. The Clouded
Leopard, Sun Bear, Gibbon and
infamous Orang-utan are to name a
few burning at the peril of the palm
oil industry. Some endemic species
are likely to have already vanished.
However, the fires are also
threatening our own species. People
are forced to wear surgical masks to
prevent them from choking to their
death on the smoke which engulfs
their homes. Even members of the
parliament in Kalimantan are faced
with the need to wear such masks.
Lists of such disastrous
consequences will not provide us
with a remedy. What can you do?
For starters check the label – does
it have palm oil? Companies such
as Starbucks, PepsiCo and Kraft
Heinz are examples whereby efforts
have been made to reform their
supply chain.

You, as the consumer, can demand
such efforts are carried out to success
via not buying their products until
this is proven. But unfortunately,
our influence is weak. If the media
ignores these issues, then the
government will react similarly. The
media sees dominance in press-
releases of a corporate nature.
Everyone is waiting for someone
else to take the lead. No one does
so because it’s not in our best
interests to do so. It is an unearthed
collective decision that everyone has
ignorantly taken, that is, to carry on
regardless.And no doubt,after these
fires and the little media coverage
they manage to obtain, silence will
resume over a more global issue:
humans and our unsustainable
habits.

named comet ‘Lovejoy’ was found
to be releasing the alcoholic
equivalent of 500 bottles of wine
every second. Although ethyl
alcohol has been detected in space
clouds before, this is the first time
ethanol, like the kind in alcoholic
drinks, has been detected. Scientists
were able to identify the ethanol gas
being emitted as the sun’s energy
causes the molecules in the comet’s
atmosphere to glow at microwave
frequencies. Telescopes were then
used to distinguish the compounds
by their signature frequencies. The
equipment is so advanced that the
team was able to determine the
concentration and composition of
multiplecompoundssimultaneously.
The research group also identified
20 other compounds including
simple sugars like glycoaldehydes,
meaning the cocktail comet’s
atmosphere is a sugar rush as well
as an intoxicator. Comet Lovejoy
made equally as cool headlines back
in 2011 when it survived flying
through the atmosphere of the
sun, something many thought was
impossible.
So apart from being a contender
for the Ultimate Lad title, why
should we care about this boozy
comet? Well, mostly because this
recent revelation may provide
clues to the origin of life on Earth.
Panspermia, the theory that comets
contained organic molecules that led
to life on Earth,is not a new idea but
these findings add weight. NASA
astrochemist Stefanie Milam, who
co-authored the paper announcing
these findings, contended, “Life
didn’t have to start with just
simple molecules like water, carbon
monoxide, and nitrogen. Instead,
life had something that was much
more sophisticated on a molecular
level. We’re finding molecules with
multiple carbon atoms. So now you
can see where sugars start forming,
as well as more complex organics
such as amino acids -- the building
blocks of proteins -- or nucleobases,
the building blocks of DNA. These
can start forming much easier than
beginning with molecules with only
two or three atoms.”
What’s next for the perpetual
party rock and the potential
origins of complex life on earth?
Dominique Bockele-Morvan from
Paris Observatory, a co-author of
the paper argued, “The next step
is to see if the organic material
being found in comets came from
the primordial cloud that formed
the solar system or if it was created
later on, inside the protoplanetary
disk that surrounded the young
sun.” This will help determine
whether this provides evidence for
the Panspermia theory or if the
asteroid of alcohol is simply a story
for Imperial’s next nerdy bar crawl.

widely known for his work as an amateur astronomist. He has
contributed many new discoveries to astronomy as well as
popularised digital photography procedures in astronomy for the
purpose of easily photographing celestial bodies.
