The top three
animated films
that aren’t
made by Pixar
I
love Pixar. Chances are you
love Pixar. too. In all honesty,
I’d hazard a guess that the
vast majority of sane people
on earth love them. Their films are
iconic and have set the precedent for
animated films that both children,
adolescents and their parents can
enjoy. But instead of watching
Finding Nemo for the eleventh time,
why not give some other storytellers
a chance to wow you?
Song of the Sea (2014)
Released first in Ireland and
England only earlier this year,
Song of the Sea describes the epic
adventure of Ben and his younger
sister Saoirse, whose newly-found
magical gift means that she must
first find her voice in order to save
the spirit world. Brimming with
luscious visuals, mature storytelling,
and Celtic charm, this film is quite
possibly my favourite of the year.
Kiki’s Delivery Service (1989)
Often described as a ‘Japanese
Walt Disney’ – a title he hates –
Hayao Miyazaki (for obsessives
such as me) is a man against which
no other animator can compare
(yes, he’s better than John Lassiter
or Chuck Jones). Kiki’s Delivery
Service stands alongside Ponyo
and My Neighbour Totoro as one
of Miyazaki’s more child-friendly
contributions, perfectly telling a
coming-of-age tale about the life
and times of Kiki, a young witch
who must adapt to a new life in the
city.
Help! I’m a Fish (2000)
Okay, hear me out guys. Yes, it’s
a terrible title; yes, its subtitle is ‘a
potion put them in the ocean’; yes,
it has a 5.8 on iMDB. Just know
that it’s not me who’s wrong – it’s
everyone else. This film tells the
story of a group of friends with
only 48 hours to find an antidote
to the potion which turned them
all into fish. It is is genuinely funny,
wonderfully Don Bluth-esque, and
even features Alan Rickman singing
a weird pop ballad – what’s not to
like?

Jafar Panahi is the
Iranian neo-realist
Since his 2011 arrest, Iranian director Jafar
Panahi’s fimmaking has become a cause célèbre
in the cinema world. We take a look at his life,
his work, and the events leading up to his ban on
producing films.
A
1995 Prix de La Caméra
d’Or-winning debut
film; at the forefront of
the Iranian New Wave
movement; imprisoned for breaking
censorship laws and under house
arrest since October 15, 2011. Jafar
Panahi has a repertoire few can
match.
Panahi is an Iranian director
who rose to fame with his 1995
film The White Balloon. The film,
praised by critics worldwide, won
the Prix de La Caméra d’Or at that
year’s Cannes Film Festival and
guaranteed Panahi a spot among
the greats. It follows a stubborn
seven-year-old girl’s journey to get
a ‘chubby’ goldfish for the local
New Year celebrations. Shot with
a largely non-professional cast and
on location, the film explores the
struggles of the working class in
Iran through the pedestrian goal
of obtaining the goldfish. One can
immediately see the influence of
Italian neo-realism – the genre
of which the Iranian New Wave
movement is most reminiscent.
The masterful use of a hand-held
camera, frequent close-ups of the
characters, and the overall style
of shooting that largely mimick a
documentary only add to this list of
similarities.
With Panahi’s films, however, we
are introduced to the stringent rules,
practices, and general life in Iran’s
capital city, Tehran, where all of his
work is based. They largely lack the
‘male gaze’, and frequently feature
child protagonists (for reasons
later explained) – both significant
characteristics in the Iranian New
Wave movement. His subsequent
films including The Mirror (1997),
The Circle (2000) and Offside
(2006), all of which feature female
protagonists, allow us to view their
limited world and the struggles
they face. An important exception
to this rule would be Crimson Gold
(2003), a film – winner of the Un
Certain Regard prize at Cannes –
that follows the humiliation of a
pizza delivery man that eventually
leads to his insanity. The central
character is both a delivery man and
a paranoid schizophrenic in real life
who did not see the completed film.
While Panahi maintains he is a
person interested in social issues
rather than politics, he does admit
they have the tendency to blur. It is
the widespread interest in his films
that has led to Crimson Gold, like
most of his other films,being banned
from screening in Iran. Censorship
laws in the country are strict when
it comes to what can be shown to
the public, consisting of a number
of rules laid down in the late 1990’s
including a ban on men and women
sitting close together, men and
women exchanging “tender words
or jokes”, booze or profanity against
religion, and neckties (they are
viewed as a symbol of foreign culture
that therefore spreads Western
propaganda). These stringent
laws are why Panahi started with
children’s films. He later explained
that “making children’s films was a
way of saying what we wanted to
say in adult films”.
With his later films, however,
Panahi has gotten more daring.
Since The Circle, all of his
films were banned before their
international release or were
made illegally and then smuggled
outside Iran. Famously, a flash
drive containing his 2011 work
This Is Not A Film was smuggled
from Iran inside a cake, to be
later screened at the Cannes
Film Festival. Unfortuntely, it has
not all been finding clever ways
to avoid the censors and come
out unscathed; Panahi has been
arrested and imprisoned on several
occasions on account of his films,
which the Iranian government
feels oppose its current regime.
The first of a long string of arrests
related to his filmmaking that led
up to his house arrest in 2011 was
in 2003 – the same year Crimson
Gold was released.After having been
arrested,Panahi was interrogated for
hours by the Information Ministry
in Iran, who asked him, “why don’t
you just leave this country and work
outside of Iran, given that the core
of your supporters live there?” As a
matter of principle, however, Panahi
still resides in his home country.
On the 20th
December 2010, he
was sentenced to 6 years in prison,
banned from involvement in films
for 20 years, and forbidden to leave
Iran. Most recently, on October 15th
2011, he was placed under house
arrest – although he has has since
been allowed to travel around Iran.
When asked whether the cinematic
value of his films lies in their
confrontation with the censorship
regime, Panahi replied, “I don’t
think it’s a value the film has, but
it’s a value I have. I become the
person who refuses to compromise;
I become the person whose identity
is defined by my rebellion against
the censorship regime. I do enjoy
that status of being the person who
is resisting this force.”
Unable to leave Iran since 2011,
all of Panahi’s films since then were
made illegally. There’s also the issue
that, as Xan Brookes puts very
succinctly, Panahi is in a situation
wherein he is “...making Iranian
films about Iranian life that Iranians
are forbidden to see.” Having the
target audience for his films taken
away, Panahi disappointedly states
that the government has left him
“deprived of the ability to have my
work influence people where it
can have most effect.” Despite this,
Panahi remains optimistic: “If a film
is successful, it will be saved”, he has
said. At this point in time, he sees
each of his films as a “document of
what life was like at the time”. He
says about the future, “One of two
things can happen: maybe times
will have changed, and they’re a
document that serves as a warning
not to go back to this dark age, or
things haven’t changed, and they’re
a warning about how prolonged it
has become, this problem.” And
so Panahi continues to do exactly
that: he documents the daily life of
Iranians in Tehran.
In his most recent film, Taxi
Tehran (2015), out in the UK
now, Panahi continues to fight his
battle with the Iranian censorship
regime. The film was made illegally
by installing three hidden cameras
inside a taxi, offering its viewers a
journey with the locals of Tehran
and bringing forward more social
concerns though the questioning of
the passengers by the driver, Panahi
himself.The film has already won the
Golden Bear and the FIPRESCI at
the 65th
Berlin International Film
Festival, continuing the tradition
of his films being celebrated
internationally but shunned in his
own country. Panahi’s resilience
through these difficult ordeals,
trapped inside a world he’s working
to change, and working around the
numerous strict limitations he faces,
is commendable. The international
support he has been receiving during
these years has been extraordinary;
an international support network
has been set up that includes
organisations such as Amnesty
International, A-list names such as
Scorsese and Spielberg,and national
governments of several Western
countries. In March 2011, Barack
Obama cited Panahi’s persecution
as an example of the oppressive
Iranian regime, and in April 2011,
Time Magazine named Panahi
number three in their list of the Top
Ten Persecuted Artists who have
challenged authority. It is with this
global support that Panahi is aware
of the quiet protection he possesses,
protection that gives him confidence
to try and fix things from the inside,
most definitely a long and tedious
task. But, as he once said, “The
system can’t last forever, I can wait.”
