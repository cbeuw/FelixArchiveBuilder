How to mash potatoes properly
N
ow, you’re all going to
think I’m crazy - telling
you how to cook steak
one week, and then
mash the next? Madness – this
bloke must think we can’t cook
for toffee! Well, I’ve taken all the
feedback from the few of you who
did read it and not think it was a
complete pile of garbage, and am
going to focus on what you liked –
the scientific part of it.Plus,I’ve had
recipe requests,so I’ll slip one in this
time – as well as nattering on less, if
I can. If you feel like i’m insulting
your cooking genius,apologies – I’m
just trying to change the way you
might look at food and why you do
the things you do in cooking.
Mash, champ, pommes
mousseline – they all focus on that
staple ingredient, the humble spud.
It’s so versatile – and I will go on to
write about the many other things
you can do with it – but mash
happens to be my favourite way of
using them. Simply done, with a
little bit of dripping from a roast –
nothing can compare for me.
However, I’ve always struggled
with lumps. And no, I don’t need
to see a doctor – these are of the
improperly cooked potato variety.
And my mother’s mash would
sometime be a teensy bit gloopy
– don’t get me wrong, we’ve both

made great mash before, but just
not consistently. Somehow, the
variations we did – ever so subtle,
like the types of potatoes, the length
of boiling or how well we let them
steam dry – really screwed things
up. I thought it was time I mastered
one of the simpler dishes out there,
so I had a look into it.
And straight away, a clear enemy
was found – starch. Or rather, what
happens when starch and water
mix. As granules of amylose and
amylopectin interact with water,
starch swells and then bursts,
forming a gel matrix over time – it is,
in fact, a non-newtonian fluid. This
product is responsible for the least
desirable feature – gummy mash. So
clearly regulating the exposure of
the potatoes to water is a problem.
I had also encountered a second
problem – uneven cooking.
Naturally, as the pieces of potato
are boiled, the surfaces heat up and
cook through much faster than
the middles. If this is extreme,
you can have just cooked interiors
with mushy exteriors, and this is
exactly what happens if you cut
your potatoes up into pieces that are
irregular or just too large! And this
gives you lumps – my second enemy.
I did have to question my sanity,
spending time researching mash
whilst I could be focusing on my
lab project, but I had found what I
needed to solve. And the solution is
very simple.
In both cases, water is not helping
us. It swells the starch and ruins
the fluffy lightness that mash
should have, and forces us to cut
our potatoes up – which not only
can lead to uneven cooking, but
also exposes even more of the cells
and their contained starch to the
water, worsening the problem! So,
eliminate the water!
That’s right – bake your potatoes!
We can all admit that scooping out
the middle of a baked potato, and
crudely mixing it with some butter
and cheese, is one of life’s simple,
delicious, pleasures. By using the
indirect heat of an oven, and being
able to cook potatoes with their
skins on, you not only speed up the
whole process (not having to peel
potatoes is a godsend!) but also
hide the starch away from water
– not that there should be any,
in your oven anyway! The insides
are perfectly cooked from edge to
edge, so the lumps are gone. In one
fell swoop, we have beaten both
enemies!
The potatoes can be simply baked
alongside the chicken – though
not in the same pan, mind – before
being taken out to have their guts
removed. Beautifully soft potatoey
goodness – so light, you can mash
with a spoon. A touch of butter,
pepper, salt and you’re away.
Smashing.

people with no regard for keto diets
or their waistlines.
Shopping List
• 16 baking potatoes, of a
similar size - any variety will
do, but King Edward are
ubiquitous and great.
• 50-100g unsalted butter
• White pepper (who am I
kidding, you can use black,
but try to grind it fresh)
• Salt
• 8 Metal Skewers
Method
Preheat your oven to 200°C/180°C
Fan.
Take your baking potatoes, and
use a knife to score a line through
the skin lengthwise around the
potatoes.
Thread two potatoes per skewer,
along their long axis.
Bake for approximately an hour,
though it can take longer - up to
two hours if you want them super
easy to work.
Check doneness by slipping
a knife into them – it should
encounter resistance from the skin,
but nothing else.
Take the potatoes out of the oven,
and whilst they’re hot, remove them
from the skewers.
Leave to cool for about 15 minutes,
until you can just handle them.
Pull them in half, and use a spoon
to scrape the perfectly cooked flesh
into a bowl – or,if you want,directly
into a sieve.
If you discover they’re not cooked
through – don’t panic! Simply return
to the oven for another 20 minutes
or until done.
Either way, mash them gently, by
rubbing through the sieve or against
the side of the bowl with a spoon
– they should just disintegrate and
form a smooth paste.
Using a fork, stir the mash with
the butter until it is all incorporated .
The amount of butter really depends
on the consistency and richness you
like.
You can add milk to loosen –
but more butter does that job too.
Season, and enjoy.
