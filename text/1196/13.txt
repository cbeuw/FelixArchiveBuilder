The D P (E& W ) s h a l l o v e r s e e I m p e r i a l
College Union's day-to-day duty of care for
students in the realms of e d u c a t i o n and
welfare.
"Representation to College
The D P (E& W ) shall sit on the following
College Committees. Some committees have
the Deputy President D P (E& W) as a named
member in the Constitution or the Chairs will
approach the D P (E& W) directly at the begin-
ning of the academic year. Others have a num-
ber of student representatives nominated by
Imperial C o l l e g e Union. These are usually
arranged over the summer, usually by the
President in consultation with those who may
be nominated.
"Within the Union
As Editor of the Union's most widely read publi-
cation, effectively you're in charge of the
Union's communication. Which is good, because
in theory no-one can tell you what to do.
In practice, there's three major limits to this.
Firstly, you have to pay for it. Secondly, Felix
still costs the Union quite a bit, and they have a
perfect right to know where their money's
going. Thirdly, if you go round upsetting every-
one, you'll have very few stories, and very little
support the next time you get yourself into trou-
ble.
So what does a Felix Editor do (apart from the
obvious)?
"Union Handbook
Together with your predecessor/successor, you
have to put a very important 180 page book
together. You won't have to write a huge

C o m m i t t e e and S t u d e n t D e v e l o p m e n t
Committee as well as playing a significant part
in the W e l f a r e C o m m i t t e e and the
Accommodation Committee. These provide
lines of communication through which com-
ments and idea as well as problems and help
can flow in both directions.
Being a member of both ICU Council and the
Executive Committee provides the channels of
communication and an opportunity for account-
ability. Sitting on the Union Finance Committee
provides a means of input on the Union's
finances and exercises the financial responsibili-
ty b e s t o w e d on the D e p u t y P r e s i d e n t
(Education & Welfare) in the C U Financial
Regulations. Being ex-officio on all Union
Committees and sub-committees provides for
input on all matters relating to I C U . This
amount of it, but you still have to make sure it's
all ok, and get some adverts.
"Advertising
Although you get some money from the Union,
next year's Editor will still have to raise a mini-
mum of £20,000 by getting adverts, any way
you can. No adverts, no Felix, no job....
"Management
Unique role this one- you're the only manager
who sees a process right through, you'll even do
delivery and cleaning. Essentially though, you
can't write it by yourself, and you need to recruit
and keep an enthusiastic team of sub-editors
and writers, right up to the end of the year.
"Computers
Biggest source of pain in your life, you need to
excludes the Union Disciplinary Committee for
reasons of impartiality.
An involvement of R A G will naturally occur due
to the role of a Sabbatical. Taking part in R A G
activities is advised, as in addition to being a
great way to relax, it also gets you to meet stu-
dents
"Casework
The job includes a certain degree of casework;
Students whose problems may be helped from
links with College or those students with "gen-
eral student life problems" may be those stu-
dents who could be helped by the DP(E&W).
Those students who require legal advice, advice
of a more practical nature such as visa prob-
lems, problems with landlords, problems with
money may be better served by seeking help
from the Union Adviser.
do a lot of computer work. You have to get good
at DTP very quickly, and teach it to a lot of peo-
ple. You also have to keep an ageing network up
and running, or things will start to go horrifically
wrong.
"Writing
Although you don't write the whole thing, you'll
still need to cover a lot of stuff- anything not
covered by your team is now your problem.
You'll also feel a strange compulsion to write a
lot anyway. You won't get a chance like this
again.
"Editing
Finally, despite the cleaning and accountancy,
you are still responsible for a weekly, registered
newspaper, and given that if you really screw
up, you can go to court, never lose sight of this.
