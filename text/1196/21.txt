The lead singer seems to be halfway
through some particularly nasty hor-
mone treatments. He's already had any
sense of s e l f - r e s p e c t surgically
removed.The bass player slaps at his
f)-etboard like M a r k Level 42 King
[faking himself into an onanistic fren-
zy. The guitar strives for 'funky', and
just about reaches 'insipid'. On the
whole, it's very Air and a bit lounge.

"... else you'll get the beating of your
life off yer father when he gets home."
Aah, those carefree days of childhood.
This most valuable piece of advice is
brought to us courtesy of Dido and
Rollo, taking a n o t - s o - w e l l - e a r n e d
break from Faithless. The tune is the
kind of uplifting, spiritual positive high
that really gets on my tits unless I'm
utterly blunted.

The birth of a star", glows the Boston
Globe. "A true original", slavers St.
Paul Pioneer Press. Frankly, to call it
shit gives shit a bad name. It yearns to
he a Lynchian road movie in song form,
°ut fails m i s e r a b l y . L e a d singer
Ambrosia Parsley bills and coos with
the voice of a pigeon sucking back heli-
um, while the backing singers "Oooh"
a f
id "Aaah" with all the enthusiasm of
rotting corpses.

ff§§||§§Another rap-rock crossover
thing going on here, but this one's
quite good. The guitar riff sounds
s u s p i c i o u s l y like N i r v a n a ' s In
Bloom, but a hook's a hook, innit?
You've got to give the man a hand
though, he manages to use "the
bird, bird, bird, yes the bird is the
word" and not make it sound silly.
Well...

You know I was saying I've got a
real problem with bands that are
y o u n g e r t h a n m e ? W e l l S o d ' s
Law I get another one! And when
they're this good, why bother! For
such a small guy, Mark G r e a n e y
has got a fantastic voice. The way
it transforms from a lilt to a growl
is absolutely phenomenal.

What on earth do A&R people think
they're doing these days? Who on
earth signs people like this? It's
absurd, this is absolute pap. The
title of the song suggests they're
talking about themselves, or maybe
we're s u p p o s e d to think that...
gosh, they're sooooo clever, aren't
they?

Kings Of Convenience
Quiet Is The New Loud
(Source)
Well, after the first listen it was clearly evident that the title of
the album was a blatant lie. Quiet is not the new loud, it's
DULL, yes D U L L . D U L L is the new loud. '"Why would anyone, who
has heard The Radar Bros' The Singing Hatchet, persevere with this?"
I thought. Similar style, dissimilar impact.
Then something happened. But what it was I was truly unable to
pinpoint. I certainly didn't embark upon a 700 page diatribe bemoaning
the spiritual and moral decay of society; wherein, I constantly argue
with my wife, rail against my daughter and, eventually, accidentally
smother my young son to death (huh?!- music ed). No, no, I didn't do
that but something definitely happened. Slate gray became crystal-
clear blue. Clouds lifted and cool, cool waves washed over me. But
first...
Who are Kings of Convenience? Why a couple of lovely
Norwegian chaps answering to Eirik Glambek Boe and Erland Oye, no
less. And the style of music? Well, let me just consult my Bible of the
Esoteric (i.e. Smash Hits): death metal? Er, no. Two-step garage?
Erm, don't think so. Ah, here we go, N A M ! N A M , that's the category!
And why N A M ? Well the searing guitars and voluminous bass evoke
sensations of flesh-scorching seas of Napalm and the ear-drum shred-
ding pulse of B-52 carpet-bombing. That or it's an acronym for New
Acoustic Movement (it's a crazy, relativistic world out there kids, you
decide!). Yes, O K , it is the latter, we're talking nights spent around
campfires beneath star-speckled skies, shimmering acoustic guitars,
pitch-perfect harmonies, woolly jumpers and woolly hats; 1,2,3, alto-
gether now.... Personally I prefer squalid-bed-sit-out-of-tune-guitar-
croakily-whispererd-vocals and a nice bottle of Mad Dog 20/20.
Sometimes. Because this album is nothing less than gorgeous, from
opening track Winning A Battle, Losing The War through to the finale
of Parallel Lines heart-fluttering swoons abound.
Something happened all right, what once appeared to be tar-
nished rock became precious stone.
Subject matter? Well see if you can guess, here are some of the
song titles Toxic Girl, I Don't Know What I Can Save You From,
Failure and The Girl From Back Then; and Lennon's on sale
again. Yes, we've heard it all before (unrequited love and emotional
decay tied in with the destructive nature of love) but we just can't get
enough. S o get down to the record store and buy this album or at
least down-load it from Napster, just give me chance to get to my
department and up-load the beauty. Only joking College Authorities!
I've already done the dirty deed.
