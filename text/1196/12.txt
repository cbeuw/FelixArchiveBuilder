What would I do?
Could you be a sabbatical? It's election time you see, and time to decide very soon,
you're tempted, here's what you'd be letting yourself in for...
So you fancy running a £3.5 million annual
turnover organisation with 30 full-time and 200
part time staff, six sites, two hundred clubs,
three deputies and around 1,000 elected stu-
dent officers?
Well some of your more formal responsibilities
are below, with some advice about each of
them:
* Uphold the policy and further the aims and
objects of the Union - at the end of the day it is
your job to see that Council's wish (that is, what
the students want) is done. You will also need
to be familiar with a great deal of regulations
and policies, as people will come to you for
advice about them and others may take you to
task if you break them.
* Be the ultimate representative of the Union -
you represent people on College's governing
bodies, both academic and managerial, and
need to perform
well in front of experienced senior administra-
tors, academics or governors, who've seen plen-
ty of 'your type' before. You will also have to
speak to the press (don't shoot your mouth off)
and often represent Imperial to the wider world.
* Be responsible for the efficient organisation
of the Union - if there are problems in any part
of the organisation, people aren't getting along
or things need to get done, you need to sort it
out. Tact, integrity and maturity are good
virtues here.
* Be ultimately responsible for the finances of
the Union. If the Deputy President (Finance &
Services), or the Union's finance department
goofs up, it's your fault. You don't have to be a
budding accountant, just be sensible and stay
on the alert.
Don't be put off by all of that though. Anyone
clever enough to get into Imperial can learn a
lot on the job, and no-one expects you to be
perfect. Humility and a sense of humour and an
ability to get on with people are useful additions
if you want to make the year a pleasant one. It
can form a solid start to any career, but don't do
it just for C V points, as you will need a commit-
ment and an ability to give a damn about stu-
dents to get through the long winter nights.
The good points are - more experience of more
useful skills than anything else imaginable, you'll
make new friends and many ex-sabbaticals I
have met remember much they enjoyed about
their sabbatical year, even if it was twenty
years ago. You are your own boss (to an extent
- remember that whole democracy thing), and
you enjoy more responsibility than many gradu-
ates have after years building up their career.
S o , not afraid to make difficult decisions?
B e u n p o p u l a r ? Sit on lots of m e e t i n g s ?
Deal with lots of bits of paper? S a y "no"
quite a lot? This could be the job for you!
S e r i o u s l y though, D P ( F & S ) is effectively
the bank manager of the Union, balancing
m o n e y in a g a i n s t m o n e y out, c h a i r i n g a
n u m b e r of c o m m i t t e e s b a s e d a r o u n d
finance and services, and attending a lot of
meetings around C o l l e g e . Y o u ' l l have to
use huge amounts of tact and professional-
ism to know when a club is going to cause
financial trouble, and make sure it doesn't
happen.
These are your main areas of responsibility:
T h e ^ D P ( C & S X s n a ^
overseeing the running and management of
all I C U clubs and s o c i e t i e s . H e / S h e will
also be responsible for ensuring that the
C C U clubs and societies run in accordance
with I C U policy, Imperial College policy and
the law. You are also responsible for ensur-
ing that the I C U health and safety policy is
adhered too and that all aspects of ICU run
as safely as is practicable.
*College Committees
The D P ( C & S ) is responsible for represent-
ing r e c r e a t i o n a l s t u d e n t a c t i v i t i e s to
College. This requires that the D P ( C & S ) sit
a number of c o m m i t t e e s , each of which
m e e t at l e a s t o n c e a t e r m a n d a r e the
appropriate place to voice concerns regard-
ing the various areas of sporting activity.
* Budgets
Your biggest task over the year is to bal-
ance the budget. This m e a n s getting as
much money as you can out of College and
dividing it fairly between societies, salaries
and subsidies.
"College Committees
Y o u h a v e to a t t e n d a h u g e n u m b e r of
C o l l e g e m e e t i n g s , ranging from the very
important (a few) to the v e r y dull (very
many). O n very many issues you and the
President will be representing the students-
these are mostly College working groups,
and will take up a lot of your time.
"Union meetings
Y o u ' l l be c h a i r i n g U n i o n F i n a n c e
C o m m i t t e e , House C o m m i t t e e (this deals
with maintaining all Union premises) and
Trading, S e r v i c e s and Retail Committees,
which deal with bars, catering, ents, advice
and the Union Shops- you'll definitely find
you have a finger in every pie.
"Training and advice
To ensure clubs run their finances properly
it's up to you to train up the treasurers- and
to be on hand when they need help. Like it
or not, your office is the first one along, and
w h e n p e o p l e c o m e in to ask a question,
they're almost certain to remember what
you say, so you'll have to make sure it's
right.
^ J i n i o n G o ^ ^
W i t h i n the U n i o n y o u are an e x - o f f i c i o
member of all committees and it is quite
worth popping in to various meetings from
time to time just to get your face seen even
if nothing else, especially at the beginning
of the year. A s a sabbatical the D P ( C & S )
has a duty to ensure that levels of student
representation are maintained on all com-
mittees this means that the D P ( C & S ) will
often find h i m / h e r s e l f attending commit-
tee's such as Trading, Services, Retail etc...
T h e s e c o m m i t t e e s a r e e s s e n t i a l to t h e
d e m o c r a c y of the U n i o n a n d y o u must
attend wherever possible.
"Freshers Fair
Probably the single biggest task that the
D P ( C & S ) will face is the organisation of
if
F r e s h e r s r a i r
about 200 c o m p a n i e s are c o n t a c t e d and
leaflets are sent to them detailing the price
of s t a l l s and the d a t e / t i m e s of the fair
e t c . . . T h e c o m p a n i e s will then mail back
b o o k i n g o r d e r s . The D P ( C & S ) will liase
with the c o n f e r e n c e office to make sure
that the rooms are available (and booked)
for the fair.
" D a y to Day
M o s t of the D P ( C & S ) ' s time is spent in day
to day problem solving and information dis-
semination tasks. The D P ( C & S ) spends a
lot of time a n s w e r i n g q u e s t i o n s , on the
phone, by e-mail and in person.
