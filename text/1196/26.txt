The Genius of Rome: 1592 - 1623

The V&A
The other day over my muesli,
while enjoying reading that quo-
tidian (except Sundays) blast of
unassailable truth that radiates
from 119 Farringdon Road, EC1
(i.e. The Grauniad), I must admit
choking on my coffee (and tipping a
good part of it over my left leg),
when I turned to page nine. For
here I espied the screaming head-
line 'Feminist cult around artist
"has no basis.'"
This headline alluded to a painting
(Judith Beheading Holoformes, ca.
1611) in the latest exhibition at the
Royal Academy (RA) and to its cre-
ator, Artemesia Gentileschi (1593-
1652/3). Judith is often interpreted
as Artemesia's response to being
raped by her tutor Agastino Tassi.
S u c h an interpretation is under-
standable - the picture is a shock-
ing depiction of two women cutting
the head off a man.
Now, Artemesia has been the sub-
ject of many an academic paper
a n d e v e n a recent b e s t - s e l l e r
(Artemisia: A Novel by Alexandra
Lapierre); but apparently, much of
this is baloney, for it is revealed by
the R A curator (Beverley Louise
Brown) that the painting is not
actually informed by the experience
of being raped - but by observa-
tions of public executions (and the
work of Caravaggio, 1571-1610). It
is not explained how M s Brown

arrived at this conclusion (from
Artemesia, via the spirit world?).
This controversy is more than I can
s t o m a c h of a morning. S o what
can be going on? C y n i c s might
argue that this is merely a shame-
ful attempt by the R A to drum up
phoney controversy for publicity
purposes. A n d what a w a s t e of
good PR girls and boys - the exhi-
bition is great anyway, with works
by all the usual s u s p e c t s (van
Dyck; Rubens; Brueghel - not the
Brueghel, but his son).
The Cardsharps (Caravaggio, ca.
1595 - pictured) is a fabulous por-
trayal of two old s c a m p s taking
advantage of a slightly credulous
(but, from the facial expression,
slightly suspicious) young man. It is
easy to see how this painting start-
ed C a r a v a g g i o ' s career when it
c a u g h t the eye of C a r d i n a l
Francesco Maria del Monte, the art
collector (and little-known inventor
of canned pineapple). This exhibi-
tion is absolutely superb and what's
more, it is a marked improvement
on the guff (e.g. Turner: The Great
Watercolours) that the R A has
been churning out of late.

If fashion is your passion, then
I head over the road to the V&/\
The C a n o n gallery is hosting an
exhibition called Imperfect Beauty
T h e M a k i n g of Contemporary
Fashion Photographs, that spills,
the beans on how those i-D and
The Face fashion shoots are con-
structed. The world's top imagei
makers have allowed their sketch
pads, P o l a r o i d ' s and repro's to
pasted together into exhibits so
that we can have an insight into
how they work.
You might think this is of no inter-
est, but remember that the prod-
uct of t h e s e s h o o t s has great
power in our culture; witness the
blame placed on fashion industry
for teenage bulimia, for instance.
S o I w a s somewhat humbled to
conclude that the success of theii
final images comes from a good
idea, sheer hard work and a dose
of good fortune; not from any cor-
porate manifesto or vast manipula-
tion by computer. Draw your own
conclusions.
