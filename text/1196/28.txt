The Felix Crossword 1196, by Wailer Ned.
C r y p t i c C r o s s w o r d :
Resisting the tempation to say "Wazzup" so long after it ceased to be fashion-
able that it's almost making a come-back, I greet you noble puzzlers to the
crossword page. If truth be told, I can hardly greet you at all from underneath
the pile of completed crosswords in which I have been buried. You all excelled
yourselves last week with lots of correct entries. Our towering intellectual behe-
moth for this week is Mr Thomas Cobb of Maths III. He wins a piece of tinsel
which still seems to be hanging around the Felix office eminating bad luck and
causing any mistakes you might find.
This week, I have two pieces of good news for you. Naturally, good news this
week can only be accompanied by bad news next week, and Guru Gingagal will
fill you in on that shortly. First on the agenda, I have managed to kill the evil
demon guarding the Felix prize vault in order to bring you a £10 book token,
unfortunately and unavoidably slightly stained with demon guts, should you
manage to complete the crossword using the cryptic clues above.
If you want to win the token, submit your completed grid to the Felix office
before 3pm on Wednesday for a chance to win the token. In case you don't
know, and there is no reason why you should, we Felix types exist in the top por-
tacabin between Physics and the liquid Nitrogen tank. Although this means that
there is the facility to suffocate most of the Felix staff at once, it also provides
us with highly effective air conditioning when that London summer heat hits.
Why precisely the bottom portacabin remains generally unoccupied is a matter
of some speculation, though I personally suspect that Turnip Henry has locked
away a particularly nasty crossword to be unleashed upon you as his final act of
revenge. Of course, it could be merely because the editor has a stair fetish.
This brings me decreasingly neatly to the second of my tidings of joy. If you
prefer a quickie as opposed to all that long, laborious exersion that some peo-
ple go in for, you may enjoy the alternative quick crossword. By a feat of spa-
tial agility which shall remain unequalled until Russia successfully lands the
defunct Mir space station on Carol Vorderman, the answers to the quick clues
on the left will fit in the grid also used by their cryptic counterparts. Thus, I have
saved countless life-giving and eminently huggable trees, but more importantly
my own time so I can watch Countdown, which I hear is soon to require a new
number-cruncher.
Until next week, don't have nightmares - we can get consonants from any-
where. Wailer Ned
