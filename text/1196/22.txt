Muse
Plug in Baby
(Mushroom)
A fierce return from the T i m § |
Buckley plagiarists. Crashing guitars,
full on reverb and a spirit that spits
bile in your face. Muse are a changed
band. This year they could well braek
from the Radiohead shadow, and be a
very interesting p r o s p e c t . L o n d o n
shows in Brixton have been lined up
for early spring, book your front row
seats soon, as it's sure to sell out.
Llama Farmers
N o t e on the door
(Beggars Banquet)
These guys are so cuddly, bless their
little cotton guitars. For a British
b a n d , t h e y s o u n d i n c r e d i b l y
American, dropping vowels all over
the place, frightful. The song doesn't
really grab you, not as good as some
of their previous efforts, but it's O K .
I have to say I have a real problem
with liking bands that are younger
than me...

Get A Life
(Studio K7)
Not in the same league as
m a s s i v e l y r e v e r e d hit
Spellbound. There are some excit-
ing and trippy bass beats coupled
with some interesting soul vocals

Kings of
(Defected)
A great dance tune to get into the
new year with. C o m e d y lyrics with
and quality bass line in a ragga style,
this one is gunna stick in your head
until you get bored, fed up and snap
the C D o v e r y o u r k n e e . D a r r e n
E m e r s o n ' s Underwater Mix shines
through.

It w o u l d be s o e a s y to rip this
apart, just like the others. S o m e
barbed attack on their sensitivity,
the fact that they probably got
the shit kicked out of them on a
regular basis at rugby practice. I
might use Alan M c G e e ' s priceless
insult, "bedwetters". But I can't,
because it's just so damn beauti-
ful. The simple harmony of two
men with two guitars, singing a
sad but slightly hopeful song. It

G a r f u n k e l and C o l d p l a y . "Even
though I'll never need her", they
sing, "even though she's only giv-
ing me pain / I'll be on my knees
to f e e d h e r , s p e n d t h e d a y to
make her smile again". These are
plain s e n t i m e n t s m a d e g l o r i o u s
by their verisimilitude. This is the
first time today I have heard any-
thing I believed, and it feels good.
get to go on a date with
Tom, Andy and Drew. You
lucky minx! Pop into the Felix
office to collect your jacket c '
greatness, and you too could
look as good as this lady on
the left. Assuming you don't
already, of course. Although
give us a week to organise it's
delivery.
Runners up will be informed by
email in due course. Thanks to
everyone who entered. It was,
of course, Queens of the
Stone Age who were NME's
album of the year.
Smut Peddlers
Porn Again
(Rawkus)
I cannot deny the rumor that I only listened to this album because
of the title and more importantly the X-rated promotional sheet (I
am selling this if any of you sick and desperate boys are interest-
ed... bids kick off at a fiver). Having never encountered this hip-hop
outfit before I was ready to be influenced and certainly had an open
mind.
The first couple of tracks definitely don't come at you the way I
hoped they might have done. The slow build up and tame lyrics real-
ly didn't inspire the soul. This aside, the mood is then livened up
with the middle of the album. The beats get heavier and more
uplifting and the energy and enthusiasm of the vocals leads you to
listen on. At this point the whole thing falls flat on its face and the
experience falls as flat as its start.
Not bad, but you would get fed up listening to tracks four and
five over and over again.
