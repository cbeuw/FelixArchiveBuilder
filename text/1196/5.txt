The United States may be proud of its abil-
ity to alternate peacefully between liberals
and c o n s e r v a t i v e s , but practical jokes are
clearly stili very much allowed. In the transi-
tion last week between the Clinton and the
Bush administrations all seemed to be going
as planned for the new inhabitants of the
White House. Bill had the left the ceremonial
welcome letter on his desk, Hillary left a let-
Martyr church was where Charlotte was con-
firmed just a few years ago and also intend-

Notereyimana, later this year. Charlotte was
buried in a small church next to her father in
Barley ..Hertfordshire, on Friday the 19th of
January with close friends and family attend-

To build on what she had already achieved in
her short time in Rwanda would be a marvel-
b u s gesture that she would have appreciat-
ed.
tor for Laura Bush with details about the liv-
ing quarters, the offices had been cleaned,
and many of the halls repainted. However,
the republican entourage and their mindless
leader were in for a shock when they went to
use their c o m p u t e r s . The letter "W" was
found to be blacked out or missing on almost
e v e r y k e y b o a r d in t h e W h i t e H o u s e .
Seriously annoyed by the prank played on
them by their d e m o c r a t i c a d v e r s a r i e s , the
conservatives were forced to crawl around
under their chairs in search of the missing
k e y s . In s o m e c a s e s the W ' s w e r e stuck
below desks, in others they were taped to
m o v i n g c e i l i n g f a n s and air c o n d i t i o n i n g
vents. It is really a shame the republicans
w e r e humiliated in s u c h a childish way, I
would have thought scorpions and tarantulas
much more appropriate. - Matt
