T w i n s B e l i n d a a n d K i m b e r l y lay blissfully
unaware of the media frenzy surrounding them
when they were snatched by Flintshire social
s e r v i c e s on the night of T h u r s d a y 18th of
January. Since their arrival in Britain, they have
a s s u m e d celebrity s t a t u s . Judith and A l a n
Kilshaw, the couple who adopted the girls for
£8,200 over the internet, have been threatened
with legal action from an American couple, Vickie
and Richard Allen. This couple claim they had
already bought the twins for £4,000 from Tina
Johnson, the head of the adoption brokers the
'Caring Heart Agency'. To add to this bizarre set
of events, the childrens' natural mother, Tranda
Wecker, now also says she wants them back.
'Fury' was Prime Minister Tony
Blair's reaction. J a c k S t r a w ,
Home Secretary, was also known
to have been equally disgusted.
Public opinion is one of revulsion.
Scandals such as this recent one
seem to have a much greater
affect on the Government than
any pressure group could hope to
have. The White Paper on adop-
tion that w a s p u b l i s h e d in
D e c e m b e r w a s not due to be
brought in until January of next
year. However, the process has
been accelerated and is now due
to be brought in this April. The
Government have proposed to tighten laws on
adopting from abroad, eager to be seen acting
swiftly in the wake of the Kilshaw fiasco.
Currently, the 1976 Adoption Act is in place.
This act makes it an offence for any advertise-
ment to be published indicating that a parent or
guardian want their child to be adopted, or that a
person wants to adopt a child, or that any person
other than the local social services authority or
voluntary adoption agency approved by the sec-
retary of state is willing to make arrangements
for the adoption of a child.
N e w Labour, like the previous Conservative
Government, have been slow in reforming adop-
tion laws. The Adoption ( International Aspects )
Act 1999 has been passed although it has not
yet been activated. This will ensure protection
for children adopted from overseas. It will intro-
duce sanctions against people attempting to
adopt children before assessment, including a
£600 fine and three months in prison. However
this will still not a p p l y to a d o p t i o n s f r o m
America, meaning it will be possible for domestic
adoption tests to be by-passed by would-be
adopters in this country. Presently, anybody
wishing to adopt a child in this country has to
undergo extensive testing lasting up to six
months. S o c i a l s e r v i c e s have to carry out
assessment of suitability and medical and police
references have to be obtained.
Adoption websites are to be cracked down on.
Health Minister, John Hutton, plans more regula-
tion of the internet. He has said that
internet providers will be prosecuted for

The so-called "net twins", left, and right, Judith Kilshaw
relaying information that breaks British adoption
rules. Enforcing this rule could cause problems,
due to the vast quantities of information which is
accessible via the internet. Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) are not licenced and are not
obligated to register anywhere. Their three main
functions are to provide access to the web, 'host-
ed web space' and bulletin boards where articles
can be posted. Therefore, it would be feasible for
the ISPs to ban a website. But fears are that this
could give a site notoriety, prompting many more
people to look at it. The law would only be appli-
cable to British - based sites, so the Government
would have no power to shut down any foreign
based sites. The sheer scale of the internet
makes the task of monitoring all information
found on 'hosted web space' and bulletin boards
i m p r a c t i c a l , a r g u e s the Internet Service
Providers Association. A code of practice to
with illegal material is already being followed the
130 internet firms who are members of the asso-
ciation.
David Kerr, chief executive of another group, the
Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), said ' I think
it's been generally accepted by ministers and t

e

police that the internet service providers don't
and can't be expected to know what's on their
servers.' He continued that the industry had tried
to stop material appearing on the web whichj
would be illegal to publish in other forms in thi
UK. What remains unclear is what status ISPs
have, since some people say that they are just,
Iconduits for
information
rather than
publishers,
and should
therefore nol
be account
able for any
illegal materi-
al found onI
them. ' 1

agrees. But the Department of Health's propos-
als contradict this.
Evidently, in the Government's haste to bring in
reforms to our adoption laws, they have failed to
properly think through the new legislation. A
prison sentence seems a bit harsh while a fine of
£ 6 0 0 is a l m o s t p o i n t l e s s , given the huge
amounts of money people are willing to part with
to adopt a child in the first instance. Greater reg-
ulation of the internet, although important, will
do nothing to stop anyone hoping to adopt a
child in the future. The Department of Health did
not consult the industry before rushing to their
own conclusions, meaning we will have laws
which are impossible to enforce and so be no
further forward in stopping the sale of children
on the internet.
