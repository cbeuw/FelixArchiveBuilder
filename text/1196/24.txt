Ba s e d partly on T h o m a s
Hardy's 19th century novel
The M a y o r of C a s t e r b r i d g e , the
Claim is an epic story of greed,
love and betrayal set against the
backdrop of the A m e r i c a n gold
rush of the 1800's. In other words,
it's a Western with snow.
Mullan plays Dillon, an Irish immi-
grant who has struck gold and
made a fortune - he practically
owns the entire, isolated town of
Kingdom Come, situated high up
in the Sierra Nevada mountains.
His mistress is the local madam
(Jovovich) and everything seems
to going swimmingly until the chief
railroad engineer arrives in town
along with an impoverished and
d y i n g E l e n a ( K i n s k i ) a n d h e r
daughter. The engineers decision
on where the railroad should be
laid could make or break the town,
and Elena and her daughter carry
a dark secret from Dillon's past.
The direction by Winterbottom is
impressive. The film really man-
ages to capture the excitement,
the hardships, and the adventure
of the early Californian gold rush.
A l s o carrying the film along are
some great performances - in par-
ticular, Mullan's portrayal of the
guilt stricken town plutocrat and
J o v o v i c h ' s r e s o u r c e f u l b r o t h e l
owner stand out.
The film c a n be s l o w at t i m e .
Indeed, the first hour, if you were
cruel, could be considered plain
boring. However, the film redeems
itself with an excellent second half.
Winterbottom has gone to great
lengths to make the western feel
in The Claim as h a u n t i n g a n d
s p a r s e as p o s s i b l e . The period
detail and snow-swept mountain
l a n d s c a p e s , are also stunning.
T h e r e isn't a g r e a t a m o u n t of
action in the film, nor are there any
shocking plot twists but the film
doesn't need them. The central
story is strong enough and the
characters are varied and realistic.
Don't go and s e e The Claim if
you're in the mood for excitement
or action. If you have tie for an
intelligent and slightly different
movie experience, it could well be
worth a couple of hours of your
time.
The Claim is in cinemas now.
Beautiful Creatures
D i r e c t o r : B i l l E a g l e s
S t a r r i n g : R a c h e l W e i s z ,
S u s a n L y n c h a n d A l e x N o r t o n
Beautiful creatures is a film
about two w o m e n w h o are
united when they accidentally kill
one of their abusive boyfriends. It
has b e e n t o u t e d as T h e l m a &
Louise north of the border (the film
is set in Glasgow) - not an inaccu-
rate description, except it really
isn't as good as Ridley Scott's film.
D o r o t h y ( L y n c h ) a n d P e t u l a
(Weisz) decide to try to con a ran-
s o m out of P e t u l a ' s d e c e a s e d
boyfriend's gangster brother. Of
course, all does not go to plan. The
visual style of the movie is a bit of
a mess, veering wildly between
pre-war industrial looks and wood
panelled nautical style interiors. It
all has a sort of made for B B C
drama look to it. The acting, for
the m o s t part, is p r e t t y p o o r ,
although Lynch and Weisz are not
too bad.
Bill Eagles says he likes his films
to be "Dark, Funny, and shocking".
Well, one out of three isn't bad.
Make that two if you like contrived
one-liners and l o c k - s t o c k s t y l e
cheesy slapstick humour. The main
problem, however, is that the film
really isn't that shocking. The plot
twists and turns it's way to an all
too predictable ending, and apart
from one moment where a man
hits his head so hard that blood
comes out from behind his eyes,
nothing really stands out.
Like Thelma and Louise, there is a
good degree of chemistry between
the two f e m a l e l e a d s (in fact,]
t h e r e ' s a s c e n e w h e r e I really!
hoped it was going to boil over,
but it wasn't to be) but unfortu-
nately, it's not enough to carry the
film. In fact the two actresses
struck up a good friendship on the
set, which gives their on screen
relationship an extra dimension.
The directing really isn't anything
to shout about, and the script is, to |
be blunt, painful. The humorous
bits are few and far between. All
too often the jokes are simply too
predictable. Don't waste your time
with this film - if you want to see a
d e c e n t f e m a l e c r i m e flick, g e t
bound on video (where - hey! - tl>e
girls actually get it on), and pray
that the arts council stops funding
unremarkable Brit crime movies.
Beautiful Creatures is out now.
