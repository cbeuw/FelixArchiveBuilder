Football - a great day out
IC1 - 0 Royal Holloway
W i t h no C o m f y , P s y c h o or
Phillipo the squad to play Holloway
didn't look that promising, Malcom
'Robbie' Dunkley c a m e up with
Nick 'French' Fumex from the 2nds
to make their debuts. To be fair
with the freezing weather it was
like playing on a bumpy astroturf
pitch, which therefore meant that
the game was scrappy and hard.
However, the IC boys mangaged
to create soem chances early on, a
slick move down the right led to
Bunny hitting the post, and it was
generally promising.
Gl Joules got injured, and then
rang himself an ambulance, well
done G l , sorry about the foot. Two
balls m a n a g e d to go o v e r the
fence, into a garden. One was an
impressive effort from George, a
beautifully skied shot. Otherwise
the goal came after about 75 mins,
when Tony broke down the left,
'crossed' the ball to Bunny at the
far post, who slotted it past their
appeals for offside. This wound
them up slightly and they lost the
plot. G i v i n g the ball a w a y fre-
quently, Fumex and Robbie both
had chances to make it two but
neither could finish the excellent
chances they c r e a t e d . The only
other notable event was the come-
back of the captain of our ship
'fast' who after a three month lay-
off still managed to take some-
bodys legs away just outside the
box, giving the spectators a heart
attack. Other notable performanc-
es included the Giant, who had a
superb game. AN G as skipper,
and Alan C o w l e y (from the half
way line). Next up R U M S and
then G K T in the semis of the cup.

IC 2nds 5 - 2 Kings 2nds
A double header? League and
cup? C a p t a i n injured? P r e s s u r e
on? No worry's lads!
Kings were bad, very bad! W e
were all over them to begin with.
They held out for a bit but just
when you thought the worm may
have turned, up pops B o y c e e e e
with a cross-cum-shot that curls
in. Next up we have your sports
editor latching on to a through ball
on the left and driving in a shot
from the edge of the area. Sorted.
Another, effort from T B from
the wing put us 3 - 0 up then
Ritchie Pratt (the captain of our
ship) made a break through the
middle. A well placed pass to lain
and, one turn and shot later, we
were 4 - 0 up.
Half time team talk? All well?
Not a chance! W e need to work to
keep it!
Substitutions necessary, but it
all went awry! They came back,
two goals that should never have
been (of course). Magic (three in
three) got our fifth, in off the far
post (was it a cross??? Of course
not!!!). Subsequent chances were
created, but no, they were not to
be. Rash Kings (f**k 'em) chal-
l e n g e s c a m e in. J P (not many
saves today) got an unnecessary
boot in the face and lain was lucky
not to be crippled by a two footed
lunge. The dirty bunch of ***ts.
Still, we won by a mile.
The Tossers!

SOP II 1 - 10ICVII
An amazing result for the sev-
enths with only our second victory
of the season but a great boost to
team confidence. As the scoreline
suggests we totally dominated this
g a m e e x c e p t for a brief l a p s e
when they scored whilst we were
already 10 - 0 up.
W e were 6 - 0 ahead at half
time after Gopal had opened the
scoring about 5 minutes in with a
clean strike from 10 yards. Sugi
scored his first of 4 soon after
before Andy Smith slotted home a
penalty for his first IC goal. A
skillful direct run down the right
led to Gurdish's first goal and Sugi
and Matt grabbed another one
each before the break.
W e had been forced to play 35
minute halves on a tiny pitch after
S O P turned up an hour late and
our original pitch had been stolen
by their firsts. Despite the short-
ened.halves we slotted home 4
more goals in the s e c o n d half,
including a s t u n n e r from M a t t
C r o m w e l l : a volley on the turn
from the edge of the box. Gurdish
scored after another storming run
down the left this time and Sugi
put away 2 more chances and Ed
was very unlucky not to s c o r e
after a mazy run through S O P ' s so
called defence.
N o w that we k n o w what it
feels like to be on the other end of
a thrashing we plan to experience
it more often.

Drinking
A pint d o w n i n g knock-out
competition? How childish! I don'l
think.
Early rounds, like all the rest
were free from illegal gambling
Early on: Magic and 8th seed Tin
had to have a second pint befon
Tim went through, lain was the
first seed to go out against, thj
surprise package, Gary Robinson.
Many further pints were drunk
One by one the seeds fell. Tim dis
played a shocking disregard fo
clothes and stripped. Paul Davie:
went out earlier than expected
soon followed by Bola Bola am
Psycho Soberg. Don't ask me wh(
beat who. I'm trashed!
Yanks looked on agog, as wel
they might! Songs were sung but
that's just what songs tend to do.
S o then, there was a final
Mark "Spillage" Dawkins had pro-
duced the Bola Bola Tankard but
whose name would be etched ont<
it for time immemorial???
It w a s b e t w e e n "Even;
favorite" John Don and the sturdj
challenger C h r i s Cullen. Steel)
glances met, Ritchie said go am
down that beer went.
Who won?
It was Jon Don!
Nice one.
