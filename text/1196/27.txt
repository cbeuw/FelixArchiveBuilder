mperial goes into Space
BOU
Have you ever thought what it would be like to be in space? Do you find your-
self looking into the night sky and wondering: 'what if?' Or are you drawn to
space by the challenges it presents to science, technology, and mankind as a
whole? Then the SSETI project is for you!
The European Space Agency launched the Student Space Exploration &
Technology Iniative (SSETI) officially last October with 300 students from
universities all over Europe, when the first steps were taken to build the first
pan-European student satellite. Currently 16 European universities from Pisa
to Manchester are actively participating in the project, which will eventually
be launched on one of ESA's Ariane V rockets. Although this is not the first
student satellite built (TEAMSAT beat us to that), this is the biggest project
undertaken so far, and certainly the most international.
Each university takes responsibility of a sub-system, or co-ordinates with
another group. They communicate with each other via web cams and IRC
chats, and there is a huge database in ESA's Dutch offices. Examples of sub-
systems are Payload, Spacecraft Structure & Configuration, Power,
Propulsion, Attitude & Orbit Control Systems, Communication Systems, and
On-Board Data Handling and there are more.
Unfortunately, Imperial does not have its own subsystem. But it is not too
late to participate in the project. Soon each group will need test their sub-
system. This has to be done in a consistent manner, and has to focus on the
integration of all the subsystems before assembling the satellite. Our plan is
to have Imperial act as central student hub to co-ordinate component and
integration testing. Eric Trottemant, the Project Coordinator has accepted
this proposal, and now we need your support!
W e are looking for people enthusiastic enough to spare some of their free
time to work on the project. W e will not have as much engineering input as
some of the other groups might enjoy, but we will keep in mind the overall
picture, and a good overall understanding of micro-satellite development.
And each member will gain an in depth knowledge of the sub-system they
are assigned to, acting as co-ordinator to a particular university.
Undergraduates, Graduates and Academics are all welcome. At first glance
this project appears very engineering orientated, but it would be fantastic if
we could recruit resources from all disciplines. Mathematicians and
Physicians for calculation and communication, Computer Scientists for
O B D H , Chemists and Chemical engineers to get to grips with the Li battery
Power supply and the Hydrazine Propulsion system. What about the
bio/medical students out there, I hear you cry? Well, there's still the possibili-
ty of getting an experiment on board, and I'm sure there's somebody out
there just dying to make use of a micro-gravity environment!

Imperial goes into Space
No doubt a few IC students resolved to 'go jogging every day' or 'join
a sports club' on the the first day of this millenium, but how many of
you are still going four weeks later? Perhaps you found running bor-
ing, and the weather this year hasn't helped... S o here's a chance to
take part in a competitive but exceptionally fun sporting event with
your friends right on IC's door step.
The Hyde Park Relays are the largest sporting event organised by an
ICU club with previous events
attracting o v e r 1 0 0 0 p a r t i c i -
pants, and have t a k e n p l a c e
every year s i n c e 1 9 4 9 . The
race c o n s i s t s m a i n l y of s t u -
dents, but also includes loca
club teams, ' o l d - b o y s ' t e a m s
from various universities and
also IC staff teams. There i s |
also a great European feel to
the event w i t h m a n y t e a m s
from H o l l a n d , G e r m a n y , !
France, Belgium, etc.
th Each team consists of either six
Imen or four w o m e n , and they
run around a 4.6km (3.3km women) loop around Hyde Park. After the
race, a tea is provided in the J C R and prizes are awarded. Aswell as
;rzes for best team and individual results, there are also awards for
best Imperial College teams (men and women) and slowest legs of
the day so there is a chance for anyone to win!! This year, Fila have
helped us out with over a £1000 prizes as an added incentive to you
all.
The traditional after race party then kicks off in D B ' s in the evening,
where the Europeans try to out party the British, usually unsuccess-
fully and we all try to dance with 'post-race legs'.
If you would like to take part in
this y e a r s event, on S a t u r d a y
17th February, 2:00pm, you can
enter at half the normal entry

If you decide that perhaps a bit
a practise running around the park is required, then come along to
one of the athletics/cross-country clubs training sessions, see web-
site for details.
