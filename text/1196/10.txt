Deadly Virus Created In
Mice, Could Humans See
The Same?
Scientists in Canberra, Australia accidental-
ly created an aggressive and deadly mouse
virus last week that some worry could produce
microbes deadly to humans. The virus formed
w h e n a m o u s e i m m u n e s y s t e m g e n e w a s
added to the mousepox virus in an attempt to
develop a c o n t r a c e p t i v e to control rat and
mouse plagues. The result was the creation
of a virus c a p a b l e of killing many different
breeds of mice, even those previously immune
to mousepox. Dr. Bob Seamark, director of
the C o o p e r a t i v e R e s e a r c h C e n t e r for the
Biological Control of Pest Animals found that
v a c c i n e s for m i c e which normally prevent
mousepox were also rendered substantially
weaker against this viral strain.
The key c o n c e r n is obviously not for lab
rodent populations but for humans. Scientists
at the center say that the mouse virus itself
p o s e s no d a n g e r to p e o p l e , but that "this
same modification could be made to human
viruses and this would enhance their virulence
or at least (strengthen) their ability to kill peo-
ple" S e a m a r k s a i d . R e s p o n s i b i l i t y is key.
"Discoveries such as this are being made all
the time," said Dr. Annabelle Duncan, chief of
molecular science at the Australian govern-
m e n t ' s C o m m o n w e a l t h S c i e n t i f i c a n d
Industrial Research Organization, "The impor-
tant thing is to ensure they are used for good,
not for destructive purposes." She has urged
a stronger Biological W e a p o n s Convention, a
treaty ratified by some 140 nations pledging
not to d e v e l o p or s t o c k p i l e b i o l o g i c a l
weapons.

Water Beneath the
Martian Crust
W a t e r may have recently flowed on M a r s
says Harry M c S w e e n from the University of
Tennessee. While, abundant evidence in the
form of surface features suggests that water
was once extremely abundant on the planet,
samples of volcanically formed rocks from the
red planet show little sign of having solidified
from m a g m a that w a s o n c e rich in w a t e r .
However, analysis of a meteorite from the red
planet known as the Shergotty, suggests that
the p l a n e t h a d a w a r m e r w e t t e r p a s t .
M c S w e e n ' s team has shown that the mete
orite contains many water soluble elements in
the interior compared to those in the outer
skin. The team's hypothesis is based on the
logic that the interior of the meteor is similarj
in composition to the interior of the planet and
the exterior of the meteor similar to Mars'
water poor crust.
Falkland Island Fire
Severely Damages Fragile I
Eco-System
A five day fire caused by exploding ammuni-|
tion on the Falkland Islands is feared to havei

R o c k h o p p e r p e n g u i n s and a l b a t r o s s . Tha
blaze began on January 12 as British Troops
were exploding ordnance from two Argentine,
planes d o w n e d in the war with the UK \i
years ago. The fire laid w a s t e to the small
nature preserve known as South Jason Island]
about 4 8 0 km (300 miles) northeast of the
southern tip of South A m e r i c a . Adult pen-
guins might have been able to flee the flames
but chicks at this time of year have not yet
become mobile and were likely burnt to death.

Rockhopper penguins crawling from the dev-
astation. A s if the physical blow dealt to the
seabirds on the island was not bad enough.
90% of the tussac grass supporting the avian
population w a s d e s t r o y e d and will take al
least 3 years to recover. Sadly, this fire only
aggravates an already grave situation for the
nature reserve which has experienced a 30)1
decline in bird populations over the past two
decades.
