Dear Felix
Seeing as so many are currently
complaining about their courses,
I may as well add my ten cents.
How would you like not to have a
personal tutor? F o r t h o s e s t u -
dents of the old C h a r i n g C r o s s
a n d M a r y ' s f i r s t y e a r c l i n i c a l
medical courses this is a reality.
Despite complaining, asking and
screaming they still haven't been
a l l o c a t e d , d e s p i t e p r o m i s e s of
them being here after the X m a s
holidays, which is late enough as
it is! I presume the case is similar
with the new course students not
being allocated their clinical per-
sonal tutors for those who start-
ed their firm rotations in January.
Exams are close, any chance of
g e t t i n g s o m e s u p p o r t b e f o r e
t h e n ? A l s o , I'd like to get to
know a p e r s o n well e n o u g h to
g i v e me a d e c e n t r e f e r e n c e .
Currently, this isn't possible with
the s t r u c t u r e of the c l i n i c a l
course as it is, we never see the
s a m e p e o p l e for m o r e t h a n 6
weeks in our firms!

Dear Felix,
I'd just like to congratulate Felix
and m o r e s p e c i f i c a l l y M a r i a m
G h o r b a n n e j a d on her excellent
a r t i c l e on 'Iranian p r i s o n s e n -
t e n c e s ' in M o n d a y 2 2 n d
January's issue. Having grown up
in England through the 80's and
90's it w a s v e r y r e f r e s h i n g to
read an article on Iran with some
perspective. Even though it was
by a fellow Iranian, I hope that
the article and the new millenni-
um act as a watershed for better
r e p o r t i n g of a f f a i r s in Iran
through the British media. This
h o p e f u l l y will g e n e r a t e b e t t e r
understanding of Iranian affairs
in this country, which hopefully
s h o u l d be b e n e f i c i a l for both
countries.

Dear John,
I imagine you are overwhelmed
after last week's 'interesting' con-
tributions on the letter's page,
but then I r e m e m b e r that I am
probably the only reader (must
be b e c a u s e I'm a c h e m i s t , too
much lab time you see).
I'm b a s i c a l l y g o i n g to r a i s e a
point I noticed ages ago, but is of
particular relevance after the last
issue's concentration on depres-
sion. A m I the only person who's
noticing your subtle references
to The Holy Bible throughout the
y e a -? N o , I don't m e a n the
favoured work of the world's rich-
est non-profit making organisa-
tion (amongst o t h e r s ) , but the
album. Not all of the album is
a b o u t d e p r e s s i o n t h o u g h , it's
amazing that this album is still
deeply relevant to a lot of issues
society faces. I'm surprised you
haven't made more of the state
of affairs in A m e r i c a , especially
now that Tipper G o r e ' s further
removed from the political scene,
and the B r a d y Bill seems to be
working. Countless songs can be
applied to Bush's beliefs and not
just the obvious song about capi-
tal punishment. Political correct-
ness seems to be less of a main-
s t r e a m i s s u e n o w , a l t h o u g h
cloning laws have reignited abor-
tion rights arguments. Perhaps
you should devote a whole col-
umn to the subjects tackled by
the album?
A s for d e p r e s s i o n , p e r h a p s a
more upbeat issue next, concen-
trate on happy things. Think posi-
t i v e , p o s t C h r i s t m a s b l u e s ' '
Surely pre Christmas? The com-
mercial concentration of hatred
t h a t is C h r i s t m a s h a s g o n e .
D a y s aregetting longer, things
have stopped dying and flowers
will appear soon. Look forward
to the year ahead.
Yours completely uninfluenced by
anything,

Thanks Andrew, glad someone
noticed my HI piece of hero wor-
ship. For the non disenchanted
indie kids amongst you, he is
referring to the classic album by
the Manic Street Preachers. I'm
told there was a book of the
same name once, too -Ed

Dear Sir,
If our new rector really is a 'pas-
s i o n a t e b e l i e v e r in the impor-
t a n c e of s c i e n t i f i c e d u c a t i o n '
(Felix 1193, p6), then he clearly
doesn't regard geology to be a
s c i e n c e . I w o n d e r h o w m a n y
other people in senior manage-
m e n t hold this o p i n i o n . A n d
shouldn't we all be a little wor-
ried?

Dear Felix
As was reported in N e w s In Brief
and the letters sections of Felix
two w e e k s ago, the I C U Curry
petition has drawn to a success-
ful c l o s e . W h i l e t h e "curry

debacle are pleased to have had
Catering's support and are said
to have been chuffed to bits that,
the curry has been returned to
the union, the responsibility for
the next stage - i.e. the return of
the c u r r y e v e r y d a y , not just I

one to buy them again.
People who visited our site were
no doubt tempted to sign our on-
line petition by the offer of 384
bottles of beer to be given to the
curry fan with the most witty and
compelling reason why the dish
s h o u l d be r e i n s t a t e d . Of the
many c l e v e r replies we had to
sift through (removing references
to r o a d - k i l l s a n d the like), we
f i n a l l y d e c i d e d on a w i n n e r -
K A T H E R I N E L E E , Maths I - well
done! W e will arrange with yon
to collect your 16 double crates
of beer from C o b r a .
Katherine's winning line may be
found at www.icu-curries.com for
the next few days.
In the meantime, we hope you all
enjoy your forthcoming lunches
at the U n i o n , and don't let the
infamous IC apathy put you off
doing anything again - we didn't!
All the best

Dear John,
As part of the I C U Council mail-

to find t h a t H a m i s h ' s e-mail
headed " L a s t C o u n c i l " referred
to the previous council, not the
last council ever as I had hoped.
As ever, Someone
