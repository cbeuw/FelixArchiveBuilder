Pro-life campaigner accuses Lord Winston of "aggressive"
assault
WILLIAM F O S T E R
B
ritain's foremost exoert on fertility research
and one of the w o r l d ' s m o s t r e s p e c t e d
researchers is f a c i n g a p o l i c e i n v e s t i g a t i o n of
assault following last M o n d a y ' s crucial vote on
stem cell research at the House of Lords.
The claims centre around a usually low-profile
.pro-life m o v e m e n t , m e m b e r s of w h i c h w e r e
{protesting outside the Lords as peers arrived for
the vote. A number of young women, mostly aged
in their twenties, had set up 101 cardboard sheep
im Parliment S q u a r e while wearing lab coats to
Imark the occasion.
Lord Winston was giving an interview for a tele-
vision network, believed to be ITN, on the subject
of the Bill. Ruth D a v i e s , t o g e t h e r with "about
twelve friends" said she was
"going in to the Lords" w h e n !
she overheard the I m p e r i a l *
College researcher answer-
ing a question with what s h e l
believed was a lie from her*:
knowledge of s t e m - c e l l ? *
research. She told Felix that
she "calmly, without jumping*
forward, said 'no it is not"'. „

Lord Winston angrily s w u n g |
round and " l o o k e d like he^
was going to hit her", S h e
alledges that the peer then put his hand over her
mouth and shouted "Shut up. You keep out of it.
I'm a scientist".
The 2 4 - y e a r - o l d b a r r i s t e r e x p l a i n e d that s h e
knew e m b r y o n i c s t e m c e l l s a r e " b y n a t u r e
tumours" and therefore more dangerous than adult
stem cells, contrary to what had been said in the
interview. She added that she had "picked up quite
a lot of science during the campaign", despite hav-
ing had no scientific training. S h e also claims that
the TV crew ignored his actions, pretending not to
have seen anything, but s e v e r a l w i t n e s s e s wit-
nessed the incident.
Ruth Davies added that she had visited Chelsea
Police Station in order to make a formal complaint,
and is currently planning to press charges against
the peer, but is "prepared to accept an apology".
Felix was unable to contact Lord W i n s t o n for
comment, but he is said to deny that the incident
took place, Many people have expressed disbelief
that the researcher behaved in such a way, and it
has been suggested among College circles that the
accusations are a way or smearing a high-profile
advocate of the "cloning" research while raising
the profile of their own, small group of "women in
b o b b l e h a t s " . A C o l l e g e s o u r c e s a i d t h a t he
believed the group were "simply capitalising on an
exaggerat.on".
C h e l s e a P o l i c e w e r e unable to c o m m e n t on
whether a complaint had been made against any
particular individual. M e a n w h i l e , ITN confirmed
that they had also heard about the alleged inci-
dent, and a spokeswoman added that it was too
early to say whether it was one of their camera
crews who had been carrying out the interview, but
said that they were "looking
into it".
In a t e l e p h o n e interview
with Felix, Miss Davies said
"It e p i t o m i s e s the way the
w h o l e c l o n i n g d e b a t e h a s
b e e n c a r r i e d out - s e l f -
important scientists trying to
silence the voice of the pub-
ic."
She added "I was part cu-
larly horrified to be touched
physically by Lord Winson. I
am profoundly committed to
the pro-life cause, opposed to abortion and embryo
e x p e r i m e n t a t i o n , and to feel on my f a c e , my
mouth, the aggressive hand of somebody who has
been so c l o s e l y invloved in the d e s t r u c t i o n of
human life was deeply repugnant."
L o r d W i n s t o n w a s e l e v a t e d to the H o u s e in
1995, and is best known for his work in human fer
tiiity Interviewers have frequently commented on
how the walls of his office are covered m photo-
graphs of childless c o u p l e s that he has helped
through IVF t e c h n i q u e s . U n f o r t u n a t e l y , he w a s
unavailable for comment as Felix went to press
Sarah M a c k e n , director of the pro-life group in
question, denied that her reporting of the incident
was merely capitalising on a misunderstanding to
raise her group's profile, soon after she paid her
second visit to the Felix Office in a day.
