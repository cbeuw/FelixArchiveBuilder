Has it been what you expected?
It hasn't, you expect certain things, I
expected it to be challenging, and at
times it's as much of a challenge as I
thought, but s o m e t i m e s it goes
beyond that and it's also one of those
bizarre jobs that gives you a unique
feeling. It's difficult to really describe,
but it's what you expect, and it's not.
It's more work than you think, there's
more time to be ploughed in than you
naturally think, but it's also reward-
ing; you expect it to be rewarding,
though it's, some days, when you've
helped somebody solve a problem, or
you've ended an issue that's been
going on quite a while, and it makes
you have a warm glow, that you've
accomplished something. It's very
strange, it's very cathartic.
What are the main challenges youVe
faced this year?
Don't know how successfully we've
managed them, but, Wye coming on
board, so many hundred students,
quite far away from the main cam-
puses, also the increased amount of
representation we have on Postgrad
committees; it's been a complete
nightmare trying to find postgrads to
fill the roles, though we have, well,
the majority of them.
What would you say are the qualities
that make a good D P (E&W)?
I think you have to be someone who
can listen, someone who enjoys lis-
tening, ask the proper questions
which gets more information out of
them. Someone who cares, someone
who basically can often see the wider
picture but also can focus on the indi-
vidual's needs.
What do you think would be the main
challenges for your successor?
I think it could be interesting, with the
way educational funding is, and with
the potential for certain departments
to be in deficit for quite a consider-
able amount of time, I think a serious
number of departments will be laying
off staff. It's something to remember
and keep an eye on, and ensure that
the teaching and learning is always
maintained at the high standards.

someone who can
listen."
You've been Editor for six months
now, has it been what you expected
so far?
I knew it would be a lot of work, and
it's been even more than I expected,
but it's also been a lot more fun, a lot
more stressful, a lot more challenging
and a lot more worth it than I thought
it would be. What I didn't expect was
how the two groups I work with -
Union and Felix people - would play
such a huge role in my life. I'm really
lucky to work with such a cool, enthu-
siastic and talented Felix team.
What have been your main chal-
lenges this year?
As you might have guessed; getting
the issue out on time has been a
nightmare- my first issue coming out
two days late was my biggest night-
mare, and things all went floopy
straight after Christmas, but are
hopefully getting better.
Unfortunately the nature of the job
means that things go wrong which
are out of my control for which I get
the blame- it's just something you
have to live with. Keeping everyone
happy is always going to be hard, but
as long as someone comes to talk to
me we usually manage to sort things
out.
What would you say were the quali-
ties that make a good Editor?
Tact and listening skills are impor-
tant, as people are going to tell you
things, and you have to be very care-
ful to distinguish what they want you
to print from confidential; sometimes
it's a subtle difference. Organisational
skills are preferable, but not essen-
tial. I think persuasion, ability to listen
and knowing when to strike and when
to be quiet. You need a sense of
humour, definitely.
What would be your advice for some-
one considering standing for Editor?
I know I sometimes sound a bit pes-
simistic- but if you can do the job, do.
It's been very tough sometimes, but
I've never regretted it.

You've been P r e s i d e n t f o r s i x
months now, has it been what you
expected so far?
Yeah, it's been everything I expected
a
"d probably more...It's proved a
y
ery hard job, there have been lots
°f Problems over the year. Becky did
a
fantastic job last year, sorting out
a lot of
the course, but it's been hard
W o r
k- challenging but I've absolutely
'0 v
ed it so far, and I'm only upset I'm
n
°t allowed to do it two years run-
ning.
What would you say your main chal-
S e s have been?
^O r r
irnunication. With the merger it's
e e
n very difficult to reach everyone
outside of the now huge sized cam-
puses we now have, out towards
C h a r i n g C r o s s , Hillingdon and
Northwick Park, so reaching every-
one, letting them know what's going
on, who they can talk to, what's
going on at home base and such has
been difficult, but hopefully we've
worked around that by building up
the w e b p a g e and n e w s l e t t e r ,
because the old methods of posters
and word of mouth aren't good
enough any more.
S o what were your main aims when
you took on the job?
To try and maintain the medics'
ethos within what is now a very big
College structure. Medics are quite
unique and therefore have quite
unique needs, it's the nature of the
course. If you're doing a Physics
degree you don't go in in the morn-
ing and s e e some eight-year-old
bleeding to death in front of you.
And the very nature that medics do
experience that means that they
react to a lot of things very differ-
ently and have different require-
ments. To try and maintain the fan-
tastic reputation Mary's and Charing
C r o s s had for creating the best
rounded doctors possible and try
and not let the research heavy ethos
of Imperial College take over the
medics.
