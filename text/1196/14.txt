Sabbatical spin
Well, it's halfway through the year, so how do ICU's sabbatical think they're doing. Feli
carried out the traditional mid-term interviews.
"It has certainly
been very interest-
ing, an experience
like no other"
"You need to be
able to take lots of
difficult decisions
and justify them."
You've been President for six months
now, has it been what you expected?
Mostly yes, I mean there's always
areas that are not quite expected,
but I think the amount I've worked is
a lot more than I'd expected or had
h o p e d , but I think some of that
worked I've created for myself, It has
certainly been very interesting, an
experience unlike any other.
W h a t have been your main chal-
lenges this year?
K e e p i n g on good terms with the
College is always a good challenge,
although a difficult challenge,
because you have two competing
problems; one you have to represent
the students, which might or might
You've been D P (F&S) for 6 months
n o w , h a s t h e job b e e n all y o u
expected?
In some ways it's been all I expect-
ed, in other ways it's been very dif-
f e r e n t from what I e x p e c t e d .
Overall, it's been as good, if not
=tter.
What have you enjoyed most about
it?
I think the thing I've enjoyed most
has been working with the staff and
the other sabbaticals, to be per-
fectly honest I couldn't hope for a
nicer more talented committed and
dedicated bunch of people
not be in agreement with the
College, secondly, you should get on
with them to make sure that they're
more receptive to your views. Some
of my work in the structural review of
the Union has been quite hard, in
that a lot of people have very difficult
views, and getting them to agree on
anything is quite a difficult challenge.
What would you say were the quali-
ties that make a good President?
Patience and tact are two very useful
virtues, the ability to stand on your
feet, the ability to believe in yourself,
good advocacy skills, so that if you
are trying to present something to a
group of very distinguished people or
whatever, the ability to persuade
W h a t have been the main c h a l -
lenges that have faced you?
Well, coming from what one would
call a non-union hack position I had
to spend quite a lot of time getting
up to speed on how the whole thing
works, but I think that's given me
an a d v a n t a g e in as much that I
don't have any preconceptions and I
can approach the whole question of
what we spend our money on and
why with perhaps a fresher mind.
The main challenges internally have
been the continuing closure of Beit
Hall, which has had an effect on our
trading profits which has been a
shame, but we are confident that
next year that will improve. We're'
them as to your line of the argument.
You've got to be able to get on with
people. A sense of humour, essential,
if you can't laugh at yourself then
don't do this job, because you'll need
some. Essentially there's no one
overriding skill, it's a whole set of dif-
ferent ones. I would also add that a
lot of people grow into the job, you
might not think you have all of those
skills, but you'll be surprised what
you're capable of when you're in this
situation.
What would be your advice for some-
one considering standing?
Don't be deterred by everything I've
just said, the job is very interesting
even if it's very hard work
also going through something of a
staff transition at the moment, and
that's been quite interesting to han-
dle. And budgets, naturally, budg-
ets are always a challenge.
So what are the qualities that make
a good dpfs?
Inquisitiveness, the primary charac-
teristic of a dpfs is to ask searching
questions and to carry on asking
them until you actually have the full
picture. You need to have a good
head for numbers, obviously, and
you need to be able to take difficult
decisions and justify them to very
experienced people in all sorts of
different fields.
"My main chal-
lenges have been
to not get pissed
off with people."
Has the job been all you expect-
ed?
It's b e e n a little h a r d e r than I
e x p e c t e d , I've done quite a lot
more work than I was expecting to
do, but it's been fun.
A n d what were your other big aims
for the year?
I didn't really have many major
aims, because now clubs and soci-
eties run pretty well at Imperial,
I'm just trying to build on what
e v e r y o n e e l s e has d o n e , m a k e
things easier, make our clubs more
successful than they are already.
W h a t have been your main chal-
lenges during this year?
My main challenges have been not
to get pissed off with people, I
think I've managed it so far, and I
think I've managed not to piss that
many people off, which was one of
my big aims for the year.
What have been the worst things
that have h a p p e n e d - what have
been your main failings?
I haven't had major failures. The
d o c u m e n t a t i o n policy is quite a
difficult one, it's been quite hard to
implement and it's been a struggle
to make sure that everything is up
to date so that clubs aren't getting
penalised when they have handed
things in. But that's not been a
massive failure, it's just that it's
been one of the hardest things I've
done and I think it could have been
done better.
W h a t q u a l i t i e s w o u l d y o u say
make a good D P (C&S)?
You have to be friendly, you have
to be quite organised, but most of
all I think friendly is the best one
because people come and talk to
you all day, and you have to be
good with people.
What do you think will be the main
challenges for your suqcessor?
To do better than I have done.
