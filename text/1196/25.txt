Steven Soderbergh's latest film
is an e x p e r t l y c r a f t e d tale
about the drug trade, e x p l o r e d
] through a series of interrelated
viewpoints. The film itself flicks
periodically between four groups of
l people each involved with a drug
cartel at different levels of the
organisation.
Benicio del Toro plays a cop in
darkest Mexico who soon becomes
embroiled in the politics high up in
the organisation due to s i m p l y
helping out the military in capturing
a
" assassin. The next two story-
'ines start out from different per-
spectives but soon merge into one.
Catherine Z e t a - J o n e s is the
unsuspected wife of a w e a l t h y
drug trafficker, who following his
a r r
est, takes it upon herself to get
n e r
husband's trial p e r v e r t e d
r e
9ardless of the consequences.
This manifests itself as killing the
r n a i n
witness, who is being guard-
ed by two police (Cheadle and Luis
G u
*rnan). Finally, Douglas plays
the new drug tsar for the U S gov-
e r n
m e n t , w h o s e d a u g h t e r
Ascends from a world of casual
drug use, to addiction and crime.
A s I've explained, desperately not
trying to give the plot away, the
structure of the film is very clever.
The most influential man finds he is
at the e n d of the t r a f f i c k i n g
process i.e. watching a loved one
become an addict, whilst the non-
descript police officer soon realises
he is at the top of the ladder, deal-
ing with corruption at the highest
level. Each subplot interweaves
intricately so that the audience can
obtain a full grasp of an extremely
deep and detailed story.
A s can be expected the acting is
straight from the top draw; with
s t r o n g p e r f o r m a n c e s f r o m an
impressive cast. The charisma of
Cheadle and Guzman works partic-
ularly well, their c h e m i s t r y and
excellent one-liners giving a wel-
come relief to what can be very
intense scenes in the alternate sto-
rylines. However, whilst Douglas is
impressive as the government offi-
cial, Zeta-Jones struggles to cope
with a part that has more depth
than other roles she has previously
played. However, this is just a nig-
gle and Traffic, will without doubt,
be one of the films of the year.
Traffic is in cinemas now.
So now you've read the reviews,
