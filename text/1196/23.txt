Eddie Mann is already a local
sporting hero when his plane is
shot down in Vietnam. His family
has a reputation for reckless brav-
ery and heroism in war, but their
fortunes have been declining for
decades, so that they were no
longer the powerful C e l t i c clan
who gave their name to Mannville,
Ohio. With Eddie's death it seems
the Mann dynasty will end with his
father Thomas, a reclusive alco-
holic and architect of the ill fated
business venture which cost the
family their m o n e y a n d t h e i r
respected place in society. Then a
baby is abandoned on Thomas's
doorstep with a note attached to
the basket r e a d i n g " E d d i e ' s
Bastard".
This is the story of that baby; a
coming of a g e n o v e l , but o n e
steeped in family legends, as Billy
Mann discovers his place in the
world. The novel may bet set in
New England during the 1970's

not however an entirely brutal
world. Despite his inadequacies it
clear that Thomas really loves his
grandson, and other members of
the Mannville community such as
M r and M r s Gruber the grocers
and Dr Connor, keep a watchful
eye. There is also the most wel-
coming woman in the town Elsie
Orfenbacher, who in exchange for
free groceries takes Billy through
the initiations of adolescent sex.
Billy has other companions in
the ghosts of his ancestors who
maintain a real presence in the
family home. A s Billy makes sense
of his life he also has to become
reconciled with the misdeeds of
six generations of Manns, as he is
quite literally haunted by the sins
of his forefathers. This is not a
dark tale however. Throughout
there is a strong vein of (some-
times black) humour and the nar-
rative is imbued with Billy's opti-
mism.
This is a fine first novel from
Kowalski, which combines a com-
pelling narrative with an assured
evocation of place, peopled with
c h a r a c t e r s both h u m a n e a n d
grotesque. He maintains Billy's
p e r s p e c t i v e f r o m c h i l d h o o d
through adolescence in an entirely
c o n v i n c i n g manner, explaining
some
mysteries but leaving others

Frightening, heartbreaking, and
exquisitely calibrated, J o h n le
Carre's new novel opens with the
g r u e s o m e murder of the y o u n g
and beautiful Tessa Quayle near
northern Kenya's Lake Turkana,
the birthplace of mankind. H e r
putative African lover and travel-
ing companion, a doctor with one
of the aid agencies, has vanished

Justin, a career diplomat at the
B r i t i s h High C o m m i s s i o n in
Nairobi, s e t s out on a personal
odyssey in pursuit of the killers
and their motive. What he might

learns make him suspect among
his own colleagues and a target
for the profiteers who killed his
wife.
A m a s t e r c h r o n i c l e r of t h e
d e c e p t i o n s a n d b e t r a y a l s of
ordinary people caught in political
conflict, le Carre portrays, in The
Constant Gardener, the dark side
of unbridled capitalism. His eigh-
teenth novel is also the profoundly

amateur gardener and ineffectual
bureaucrat, seemingly oblivious to
his wife's cause, discovers his own
resources and the extraordinary
courage of the woman he barely
had time to love.
The C o n s t a n t G a r d e n e r is a
magnificent exploration of the
new world order by o n e of t h e
