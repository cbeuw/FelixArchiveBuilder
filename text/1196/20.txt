BS2000
Simply Mortified
(Grand Royal)
B S 2 0 0 0 is the s i d e project of
B e a s t i e B o y , A d a m Horovitz and
tour D J Amery Smith. With creden-
tials like that, I was expecting some-
thing pretty special, maybe a bit hip-
hop, maybe a bit punk. What you get
is neither of those, and is like noth-
ing I have heard before. If compar-
isons must be made, it sounds like
Bis on acid.
The t r a c k s a r e mainly s h o r t ,
upbeat ditties, played on a synthe-
siser, while someone plays along on
drums in the background. There is a
very underground feel to this, and no
doubt that is the intention. Some of
the songs are great fun, cute little
pop numbers. M y f a v o u r i t e s a r e
Yeari / like BS and The Side to Side.
Some of them are just plain strange.
There is no doubt that this is very
experimental. I feel the band is just
playing around trying to get some
inspiration, rather than trying to
make good songs. There are high-
lights, p a r t i c u l a r l y the first f e w
tracks, but the good bits don't last
long enough to make this album
great.

Spooks
S.I.O.S.O.S. Volume One
(Artemis)
Spooks are an American hip-
hop a c t c o n s i s t i n g of a
female singer and four male rap-
pers, or perhaps that should be a
female singer, three male rappers
and one obscure alien hybrid who
at one stage insists that he's
actually "two guys multiplied by
93 guys". Well I believe him any-
way. If you're wondering what
S.I.O.S.O.S. stands for, I'm afraid
you'll have to keep on wondering.
A s for the music, two tracks
stand out in particular. The pol-
ished Things I've Seen has a
catchy chorus and a good bass
line, and the fact that it's their
current single would surprise no-
one. But perhaps the best track
on the album is Karma Hotel,
which b o a s t s another s m o o t h ,
addictive chorus, a clever chord
progression and a rapped story-
line that really makes you listen
to the lyrics a s our "hero" gets
involved in a game of Russian
roulette.
T h e r e a r e also a couple of
changes in tempo and style worth
mentioning. Sweet Revenge is far
more laid-back than the rest of
the album, with a relaxed beat
and flowing vocals. Meanwhile,
Swindley's Maracas has a latino
feel and though it's not bad in
itself, the one-track change in
style doesn't quite work.
Most of the other tracks have
a good beat and the odd interest-
ing feature. However, there's still
too much of your average, pre-
dictable hip-hop fare with little
melodic interest, lots of repetition
and several hundred expletives.
An interesting skit sequence
runs through the whole album, in
which a promoter tries to con-
vince each individual member of
the group that the other four have
far l e s s talent a n d s h o u l d be
dumped. This serves to add vari-
ety as well as being humorous.
S.I.O.S.O.S. Volume One is
certainly an impressive album,
though you'd have to be a big fan
of the genre for it to become an
essential purchase.

Lowfinger
Who's Cot The Biscuits?
(Elemental)
On reflection, definitely not similar
to Black Grape as somebody sa«
to me. Certainly not. Lowfinger are
way too experimental and sober to
be compared with Shaun Ryde;s~
sad attempt at a comeback. Therv-e
a balls-out (even the girl) rock band
with an emphasis on blasting ou
some quality, funky tunes. There's,
an unhealthy interest in fingers
(Super Finger, Airfinger, Pulling
With The Fingers, Beach Finger
and I don't doubt for a minute tha
it's dirty. But hey, what's a fun-lov
ing group of kids doing if there's no
some fascination with body part
somewhere? If this is the shape o
things to come this year, then it's
going to be a cracker.

My Vitriol
Finelines
(Infectious)
The long a w a i t e d debut album
from the "hardest working band i
n
British music" is finally here, the
wait has been well worth it. From
start to finish, the sonic assault is
relentless, both shimmering and
full-on, neck throttling buzzing gui-
tar riffs, thundering drums and
more hooks than you can shake a
stick at. This is eclecticism meets
pop m e e t s rock all in one. Thel
i n f l u e n c e of S o n i c Y o u t h , My
Bloody Valentine and Nirvana are
ever present. The highlights of the
album are without a doubt the sin-
gles, Cemented Shoes, Pieces
and the re-released Always: You''\
Way. An incredible album from an
incredible band and my brother
knows the bassist!
