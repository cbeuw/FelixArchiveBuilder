IC claim 3 out of 4 places in ULU cup finals
IC!...
UCL.
Surfing on our relentless tide of success,
the firsts have once again gained a place
in the ULU Cup final. Today's game was
a significant milestone in our quest for
total London domination. The game
started gnarly, the UCL swell coming on
strong with the odd overhead set. fluffy

MISCELLANEOUS
Ultimate frisbee 19-6 Southampton
duly dispatched by Blue Underpants.
Out the back. Fluke paddled in slotting
into the barrel to put the second home.
James started upping the pressure with
his casual but hard core long board
stylee. Flashy Wanker stepped up with
his 10ft big gun and took off on a 25
footer of mavericks - goal. The wind
turned on shore, and 6ft glass became
4ft mush. Blue Underpants piled in a dif-
ficult situation punches the lip - the
fourth was in. All in all a good sunset ses-
sion. Massive.
Disco Squad..
St Bart's
O n e team, fifteen dreamers, five magic
goals, all can be summed up by a single
word. LEGENDARY...
The Disco boys are in the final of the
ULU cup! Nothing can stop us now!
Just to be sure, I have analysed the
possible effects of a meteor impacting
in the middle of Motspur Park in three
weeks time, and can only conclude that
it would have to weigh more than Via-
gra's Bollocks to even phase us. That's
more than 352 tonnes, facts. And unless
Filtrum's got an arse like a mortar, I don't
think that's going to happen.
On Sunday, the Disco Squad was
tanked up and ready to groove, courtesy
of some impressive family planning,
although the looming showdown did
mean that Cantle wisely limited himself
to a dozen sherboids.
So we were soon on the pitch of joy,
with Filtrum looking like he'd just been
thrown out of the London School of
Vagrancy for excessive dribbling. The
whistle blew and we went after Bart's like
Fulltum after some hapless American.
However, their defence didn't put up as
much resistance and before long the
Sundance Kid did his fancy spinning
effort and slapped the ball passed the
mesmerised Bart's keeper.
Play was always going our way and
before half time the Sundance Kid and
Fabio had penetrated their defences
again. 3-0 to the golden boys.
The second half started with a bit of
fire from the Bart's Boys, but the Disco
Deluge quickly swamped it. Lager Lager,
Indian Carpet Catalogue and Baps put a
veritable barrage of strikes beyond the
flailing reach of the keeper, and Fabio
and the Sundance Kid actually scored. 5-
0 to the Disco Boys.
The Disco Squad has seen off
another challenge. Maybe the result
wasn't a fair reflection of how good
Bart's are. Yeah, and maybe Terrier's not
a virgin?!?
So, well done again boys, we are the
chosen ones. Well done to Pete Tong
for turning up at all. He looked as
healthy as an alcoholic rat emerging
after a week's holiday in Rezoola's pants.
Nice.
Come on boys, we going all the
way! Disco...
ICSM I
KCL I..
Having lost to KCL llnds earlier this sea-
son on flicks, we understandably, had
very low expectations going Into this
match. Our initial reservations were com-
pounded when they scored in the first 5
minutes, but we held them to 1-0 until
half-time. Then the game turned ugly. 2/3
rds of the way into the match, they were
3-0 up and and we were struggling. To
say the situation was gloomy would be
an understatement.
However, by divine Intervention we
were given new heart. Through pure
aggression and dogged determination
we battled away, and by the end, our
overwhelming passion proved too much
for the obviously rattled KCL team.
Through swift passing and shrewd vision
we scored 3 goals in the next 10 minutes
to draw level.
Vik scored two absolute screamers
and Alex finished it off when he deftly
lifted the ball over the keeper, leaving
him floundering. This was a heroic per-
formance all round, and with such a
band of spirited warriors, the UL cup will
be ours!
