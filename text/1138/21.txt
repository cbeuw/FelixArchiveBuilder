A r m o u r e d Division; partially b e c a u s e It
is a g o o d g a m e , but mostly b e c a u s e o f
the lost practice time in order t o c o m -
pete in t h e b i g S h o g o s h o w d o w n . Well
perhaps not, but in order to save face
and not be c o m p l e t e l y c r u s h e d by a
b u n c h o f spotty f o u r t e e n year olds, t h e
t e a m d e c i d e d t o get s o m e practice in

T h e b i g t h i n g w i t h first p e r s o n

might have b e e n p u m p i n g iron, e a t i n g

only can y o u rack up a

Graphically it fol-
lows the A n i m e ideals
o f b i g a n d blocky.
Thus it doesn't have
the organic feel that
Half-Life has. A n o t h e r
p r o b l e m is the large,
expansive battlefields.
In o r d e r to d i s p l a y
these large o u t d o o r s c e n e s they have
had to simplify t h e p o l y g o n s . This at
least m e a n s that o n a l o w e n d P e n t i u m

n o n e o f t h e usual pop-up or f o g g i n g .
The s o u n d , t h o u g h , w a s average. It
had b i g r u m b l i n g robot footsteps a n d

t h e best. T h e r e w a s n o n e o f t h e

for a luxury car - not so g o o d at creat-
ing t h e effect o f t h e heat o f battle.
O n e little g e m , t h o u g h , is the idea
of a s q u a d . Instead o f b e i n g the only
m a n in, y o u o f t e n get d r o p p e d in with

the harder levels, never quite reaches
the s a m e r a n g e o f e m o t i o n s that Half-
life can. If y o u buy a s e c o n d first person
s h o o t e r this s p r i n g seriously consider
this o n e , if y o u are only o u t to buy o n e
then Half-life still rules this k i n g d o m ,

Another first person shooter? A poorly
written attempt to cash in o n the cult car-

the m e a n i n g o f foul play.
The graphics are excellent. Some-

f o r m the t w o d i m e n s i o n a l cartoon
into a three dimentional festival o f
the bizarre without losing the charm

There is o n e p r o b l e m with
