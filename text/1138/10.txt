Depardieu, if you like. But it is m o r e than
just historical reportage; it explores t h e
isolation that everyone feels at times. A

The entire cast g a v e g o o d perfor-

Royal Court Theatre Upstairs
S
et in a Yorkshire bread factory in t h e
1970s, Toast is essentially a n e x a m -
ination o f t h e different w a y s in
which p e o p l e c o p e with m o n o t o n y a n d
b o r e d o m . Indeed, t h e factory staff r o o m
during t h e Sunday night shift m a y not
s e e m t h e most exciting o f locations for
a play, but y o u will find yourself capti-
vated a n d reluctant to leave.
With n o plot as such, t h e c h a r m lies
in the extraordinary a n d fascinating char-
acters, a n d with an excellent cast to play
t h e m , t h e personalities o f all seven are
brought out brilliantly. Mark Williams ( t e d
Dwarf, The Fast Show) a n d S a m Kelly
(Coronation Street) ate t w o o f the better
k n o w n ones, but o n board are also t w o
proficient Shakespeare actors a n d s o m e
very e x p e r i e n c e d theatre stars.
Each o f t h e m has a different w a y o f
getting t h r o u g h t h e 12-hour shifts -
there's t h e realist, t h e optimist, t h e
dimwit, the hard worker, the escapist, the
self important o n e a n d t h e lunatic.
Throughout t h e course o f t h e play they
reveal their idiosyncrasies, motivations
and details a b o u t their outside lives.
The play is written by stand-up c o m e -
dian Richard B e a n w h o h a s actually
w o r k e d in t h e bread industry a n d t h e
director, Richard Wilson (One Foot in the
Crave) ensures that n o n e of the h u m o u r
is lost. There are s o m e very funny scenes,
does this by m a k i n g their h u m d r u m lives
appear m o r e c o n v i n c i n g a n d it really
does feel weird to be so enthralled by the
m o n o t o n y of their lives.
a n d in fact relieved that in t h e e n d noth-
ing has c h a n g e d . T h e plant is faced with
closure a n d t h e workers are forced to
confront their real feelings a b o u t their
jobs. This illustrates t h e characters' feel-
ings o f b e i n g trapped, a n d their lack of
control over their o w n lives. Yet w e are
also s h o w n their strange reluctance to
leave it, a n d t o keep everything h o w it
has always b e e n .
A n o t h e r recurring t h e m e in t h e play
is identity, a n d h o w t o define yourself
w h e n y o u have n o specific role in life but
tinning bread. Again, w e are s h o w n h o w
each o f t h e characters c o p e s with their
anonymity a n d w e leave with a real feel-
ing o f k n o w i n g a n d u n d e r s t a n d i n g each
of t h e m .
You'll w a n t t o b e back to s e e what
h a p p e n s in t h e next shift.
