All we are saying Is give war a chance
There are a f e w g a m e s d e v e l o p e r s
w h o s e n a m e s h a v e b e c o m e s y n o n y -
m o u s with high quality, lovingly created
products. David B r a b e n , t h e B i t m a p
Brothers, J o h n R o m e r o - all t h e s e p e o p l e
have b e e n s p o k e n o f as g a m e s vision-
aries; p e o p l e w h o have s u c h creative
ability that a n y n e w product f r o m t h e m
is awaited with baited breath. The g o d -
father o f t h e m all, however, is Sid M e i e r .
Sid M e i e r h a s b e e n d e v i s i n g a n d
producing g a m e s since t h e mid-eighties,
creating several near-classics in t h e
course o f his career. But t h e g a m e h e
will be r e m e m b e r e d for is a little thing by
the n a m e o f Civilisation (1990), a n d its
sequel Civilisation 2 (1995).
Civilisation is a brilliantly s i m p l e c o n -
cept. You start out as t h e leader o f a n
insignificant tribe o f n o m a d s , a n d your
goal is b e c o m e t h e s u p r e m e ruler o f
earth by c o n q u e r i n g t h e other tribes.
However, in order to gain supremacy,

research, n e w
m e t h o d s o f
g o v e r n m e n t
b e c o m e available. Civilisation is a g a m e
of juggling, balancing t h e n e e d s o f your
people against t h e needs o f your military
against t h e n e e d s o f your e c o n o m y . As
your empire grows (assuming that it does
grow) y o u have to deal with barbarian
uprisings, unrest a n d occasionally revolt
in your cities, a n d o f course t h e ever-pre-
sent threats o f n e i g h b o u r i n g empires.
Any g a m e s player worth their salt will
be familiar with Civilisation (colloquially
k n o w n as Civ), a n d t h e vast majority will
have tales o f days a n d nights lost to its
thrall. M a n y o f those will
almost literally worship t h e
g a m e -1 k n o w for a fact that
our beloved G a m e s Editor
keeps his copy o n a velvet
c u s h i o n in a g o l d cabinet
encrusted with fine jewels.
Civilisation2 (likewise k n o w n
as Civ2), w h i c h w a s a n

ties a l l o w i n g p e o p l e t o
d e v e l o p their o w n scenarios - b e c a m e
the first g a m e to usurp t h e original f r o m
its perch at the very t o p o f t h e g a m i n g
tree. Next time y o u h o o k u p to t h e w e b ,
d o a search for websites d e v o t e d t o Civ2
- y o u will find thousands, w h i c h is a trib-
ute to quite h o w g o o d a g a m e it is.
N o w Sid M e i e r has p r o d u c e d A l p h a
Centauri, Civilisation 3 in all but n a m e
(the reason for t h e n a m e c h a n g e is long
a n d boring, but if anyone's really inter-
ested b u y m e a pint next t i m e y o u catch
m e in t h e U n i o n bar a n d I'll tell you). At
the e n d o f Civ (and Civ2) your e m p i r e
built a vast interplanetary spacecraft, a n d
sent a band o f voyagers across space to
c o l o n i z e t h e stars. A l p h a Centauri picks
u p t h e story there. D u r i n g t h e v o y a g e
your colonists split u p into seven indi-
vidual factions. These factions a d o p t e d
their o w n ideologies a n d u p o n arrival at
the planet set u p their o w n e n c a m p -
ments. The race for planetary d o m i n a -
tion begins.
Any-
o n e w h o
has played
the Civ
g a m e s will
k n o w what
to expect
next. In
fact anyone
w h o ' s
played t h e
Civ g a m e s
will have
stopped
reading
l o n g a g o
a n d will by
n o w be h u n c h e d over a flickering screen,
for those o f y o u left out there in Felix-
land, your j o b is t o d e v e l o p your faction
a n d gain superiority over the other lead-
ers. As b e f o r e this is d o n e t h r o u g h
research, construction a n d trade.
" H a n g o n a sec" I hear y o u cry "why
should I g o a n d s p e n d m y hard-earned
o n another copy o f essentially t h e s a m e
g a m e ? I c o u l d just g o off to my jewel-
encrusted casket a n d play Civ2 again."
Well, here's t h e rub. T h e only real n e g -
ative about both Civ a n d Civ2 w a s that
Lie, m a k e p e a c e t h e n s e n d In t h e t r o o p s .
Definitely not t h e best w a y t o m a k e friends a n d
influence p e o p l e
ultimately you had to g o out a n d conquer
your e n e m i e s . Y o u couldn't just live in
p e a c e a n d h a r m o n y with t h e m as a b i g
happy global family - y o u h a d to g o out
a n d hit t h e m over the h e a d with a stick
until they a g r e e d to b e part o f y o u r
empire. A l p h a Centauri c h a n g e s that,
and that c h a n g e o p e n s up t h e course o f
the w h o l e g a m e . There are n o w four
paths to
victory:
conquest,
diplomacy,
e c o n o m i c
superiority
a n d tran-
s c e n d e n c y
(the evolu-
tion to a
n e w level
of c o n -
scious-
ness). It is
n o w t h e o -
retically
possible
(although
still bloody hard) for t h e faction with t h e
smallest, w e a k e s t e m p i r e to w i n t h e
g a m e . That means that, rather than con-
centrating o n research with military appli-
cations (generally it b e c a m e a rush to see
w h o c o u l d d e v e l o p tanks first), t h e
research y o u undertake d e p e n d s o n t h e
goal y o u are p u r s u i n g . This c h a n g e
inflates your options to a staggering, in
fact almost frightening degree. I'm n o
m e a n player of Civ myself - s e a s o n e d
w o u l d be a n understatement - but there
have b e e n several times over t h e past
f e w days w h e n I have h a d to seriously
step back f r o m t h e g a m e a n d w o n d e r
just h o w I'm g o i n g to get to w h e r e I want
to g o - t h e range o f different options is
quite stunning.
There is o n e other major g a m e p l a y
advance that separates A l p h a Centauri
f r o m Civ a n d Civ2. The different fac-
tions n o w all b e h a v e in recognisably dif-
ferent manners. The militaristic Spartans
are all threats a n d bluster,
a n d keep w a n t i n g to g o out
a n d bash p e o p l e over t h e
head. The diplomatic U N
w a n t to b e nice to every-
o n e a n d gain their trust.
The Gaians believe in living
In concert with t h e natural
p r o c e s s e s o f t h e planet.
T h e s e different m a n n e r s
drastically affect the w a y
that these factions react to
you, a n d consequently the
way that y o u react to t h e m .
Suggest to t h e Gaians that
a useful alliance c a n be
m a d e with the M o r g a n i t e s
(the b i g business faction),
a n d they'll l o o k at y o u horrified, a n d
quite probably refuse to talk to y o u for a
l o n g t i m e afterwards. T h e Believers (reli-
g i o u s f u n d a m e n t a l i s t s ) don't like t h e
intellectual c h a l l e n g e s o f t h e University
faction (umm... quite g o o d at research,
w o u l d y o u believe), a n d start to look all
squiggly-eyed at t h e m a n d their allies.
Basically these t w o major changes
perfect the con-
cepts originally
laid d o w n in
Civ. The other
t w e a k s (vastly
i m p r o v e d
g r a p h i c s a n d
s o u n d , the abil-
ity to d e s i g n
your o w n units,
multiplayer
g a m e s over a
network a n d so
on) are cos-
metic - i m p o r -
tant yes, but
ultimately cos-
metic. By free-
ing t h e g a m e p l a y o f t h e single goal a n d
introducing significant differences in t h e
c o m p u t e r A l , Sid M e i e r a n d his t e a m
have m a d e a g e n u i n e l y essential g a m e
for any gamer. This g a m e is t h e best o n e
I have ever played, a n d it's hard to s e e
anything c o m i n g a l o n g for a l o n g long
time w h i c h will give it anything m o r e
than a m o d e r a t e j o g for its m o n e y .
Forget t h e thesis, forget t h e world
outside, forget sleep. Buy this g a m e . It's
that simple.

N o honestly if y o u w a n t t o k e e p
sane a n d get a decent nights sleep over
the next m o n t h , year or e v e n d e c a d e
dont b u y this g a m e . People will s e e your
d e e p s u n k e n eyes a n d white monitor
b l e a c h e d skin a n d will rightly a s s u m e
y o u n e e d medical attention...remember
A l p h a Centuri screws y o u up...
