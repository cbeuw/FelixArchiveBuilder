In brief...
No Smoking Day
W e d n e s d a y 10 M a r c h is national N o
S m o k i n g Day, a day i n t e n d e d t o help
p e o p l e w h o w a n t to stop s m o k i n g . Pre-
vious years have proved very successful,
with over a million smokers regularly giv-
ing up for t h e day, a n d a r o u n d forty
t h o u s a n d quitting o n a m o r e p e r m a -
nent basis. Events promoting t h e day will
be taking place throughout t h e country,
organised by various health p r o m o t i o n
a g e n c i e s , heart a n d cancer charities,
and s m o k i n g e d u c a t i o n bodies.
M e a n w h i l e Forest, t h e s m o k e r s '
rights g r o u p , h a s u r g e d s t u d e n t s t o
gnore N o S m o k i n g Day, dismissing It as
'health fascism". In retaliation Forest is
organising a trip to Paris for t h e day, a n d
is s u g g e s t i n g that s t u d e n t s all o v e r
Britain should join t h e m , t o escape w h a t
Forest's director S i m o n Clark called "24
hours' c o n t i n u o u s n a g g i n g f r o m the
h u m o u r l e s s a n t i s m o k i n g b r i g a d e " .
Despite M r Clark's c o m m e n t s , N o Smok-
ing Day can b e a useful t i m e for m a n y
w o u l d be quitters,- as t h e UK has t h e
highest s m o k i n g rate a m o n g 16-24 year-
olds in Europe, this can only b e a g o o d
thing.

Virgin Internet Bid
Virgin are investing £50 million to get all
parts o f t h e e m p i r e fitted with e-com-
merce facilities. Virgin Net, t h e g r o u p ' s
nternet c o m p a n y , is also e x p a n d i n g its
service a n d o f f e r i n g free w e b s p a c e

investment plans are all part o f a m o r e
general p r o g r a m o f p r o m o t i n g internet
growth, a n d in particular internet s h o p -
p i n g u s i n g Virgin outlets. W h i l e t h e
m o v e s e e m s like a prudent business
decision, it remains to be s e e n w h e t h e r
the British public will w a n t to purchase
their plane a n d train tickets, m u s i c a n d

Falling Standards?
Following t h e creation o f n e w Universi-
ties in 1991, c o n c e r n s have repeatedly
b e e n raised regarding t h e possible dilu-
tion o f t h e traditionally high a c a d e m i c
standards in British Universities. To inves-
tigate these allegations, M i d d l e s e x Uni-
versity is u n d e r t a k i n g a study o f
standards in universities a n d colleges o f
higher education across Britain. The Uni-
versity apparently w o u l d like to hear
f r o m a n y o n e w h o is in possession of
concrete evidence that standards are
either b e i n g m a i n t a i n e d or diluted. If
y o u feel y o u might b e able to help, the
University invites y o u to contact Profes-
sor A l d e r m a n , M i d d l e s e x University,

Student Sub-Let
Shocker
Two female students have b e e n thrown
out o f Q u e e n M a r y a n d Westfield Col
lege halls following t h e discovery during
r o o m inspections that their r o o m s w e r e
b e i n g sub-let. The inspections w e r e trig-
gered following the receipt of an anony-
m o u s letter at t h e Residences Office by
an irate student w h o had not b e e n allot-
ted a r o o m in halls in a n y o f her three
years at t h e college.
U n c o n f i r m e d figures suggest that
o n e in every five r o o m s in t h e halls is
p e r m a n e n t l y shared by a student a n d
her or his "partner".
BMA Racism Report
The British M e d i c a l Association (BMA)
has a d m i t t e d that racism is not just rife,
but i n s t i t u t i o n a l i s e d t h r o u g h o u t t h e
" w h o l e culture" o f t h e medical w o r l d
This c o m e s as n e w research has s h o w n
yet again that white applicants to m e d
ical schools a r c twice as likely to gain
places as their black or Asian peers.
The admission c o m e s as institutions

r e g a r d i n g their policies a n d o u t l o o k
t o w a r d s racism in general. While m a n y
institutions have f o r m e d policies o f not
tolerating racism in any form, it remains
a fact that ethnic minorities are six times
m o r e likely to face disciplinary action
f r o m t h e General Medical Council, while
consultants w h o are w h i t e are m o r e
than three times m o r e likely to obtain a
merit a w a r d than t h o s e f r o m e t h n i c
minorities. Moreover, junior doctors with
Asian s u r n a m e s have only half as m u c h

N H S hospital j o b as others.
The acceptance is by n o m e a n s uni
versal a m o n g t h e profession, h o w e v e r
Prof Roderick M a c S w e e n , chairman o f
the A c a d e m y of Royal M e d i c a l Colleges
said: "I d o not think the medical pro
fession is racist in any way. I a m aware
of accusations o f racism. But the pro
fession has l o o k e d at it a n d is very c o n
scious that it must not be seen to be
racist at all."
