More on Bike Theft Mary's Merger Welcome?
Dear Felix,
I write in response to Neil Forsyth's letter
published in the last issue.
A couple of years ago, I used to cycle
to and from College everyday. Within the
first two months of c o m m u t i n g by bike, I
had had TWO bikes stolen. The first time I
had parked it at the racks just outside the
Elec Eng main entrance, and the security
cameras were too far away to pick up any
useful footage. So w h e n I got my second
bike I m a d e sure I parked it right in front of
the two cameras outside RSM. W h e n this
second bike got stolen, the security camera
picked up all the action, but because the
infrared lights on the cameras were off-line,
only the silhouette of the thief could b e
seen, and no identification could be made.
Given this kind o f situation. Security
could hardly make any claims on the effec-
tiveness of the cameras. M y objection is that
they should at least make sure that the cam-
eras are in perfect working condition at ALL
times. M y advice to anyone w h o needs to
lock their bike o n campus: don't use a
brand-new bike (and if you want to use one,
give it a g o o d bashing first so it looks worn
out!), and take the saddle off w h e n you
leave your bike.

Dear Felix
O n Thursday the 18th o f February, m y
mountain bike was stolen from in front of
the BMS building w h e r e it was d o u b l e
locked to the green side of the standing
fence with a D-lock and a kryptonite cable
lock. The event took place s o m e t i m e
between 10am and 3pm, in broad day-
light and in an area where people are con-
stantly walking by.
M y bike was brand n e w -1 had it for
under two weeks, since this was a replace-
ment bike for o n e that was stolen in early
in November. As I a m not allowed to bring
a bike into the BMS building, I ha v e n o
choice but to keep it locked outside. I think
it is ridiculous that anyone w h o cycles Into
college every day should have to ride in a
severely dilapidated bike to discourage its
theft because the college has no concern
over the property of their students and staff.
I would be interested to see the total esti-
mated value of all of the bicycles reported
stolen from the college per year and w o n -
der if this cost w o u l d be e n o u g h to stimu-
late a response from those in a position to
take action or is it just a complete lack of
interest from those w h o are unaffected?
In any event, t h e least the college
should d o is make all staff and students
aware of the thefts and encourage people
to look for and report any witnessed events
that could help catch or deter the thieves.

Teddington to property developers, the
medical school to a multinational. What's
next? Arc the students at Mary's to b e
leased out to film companies as extras? Has
IC g o n e m o n e y mad? The promises m a d e
by IC that the second year medics would-
n't b e adversely affected by the merger
have proved false. By selling the m e d
school IC will take away their h o m e and
probably ruin their medical school experi-
ence. What w e are seeing n o w resembles
an aggressive takeover with Mary's being
broken up and sold to the highest bidder.
Their minds don't appear to b e o n the
important issue-the student. And w h o are
these m o n e y m e n w h o control the path of
Imperial? I have a vision of Dr. Evil sitting in
his large black leather chair plotting world
domination and if anyone disagrees his, fin-
ger reaches for the red button under the
table.
Apparently, the discussions with Glaxo-
Wellcome about the sale of the m e d school
have been g o i n g o n for some months.
This sort o f issue only ever comes to the
attention of the student w h e n it is leaked.
Is the information being with-hcld pur-
posefully until everything is signed, sealed
and any student protest would be in vain?
In fact - is Imperial being run by Tony Blair?

Nice one, RSM
To everyone involved in C a m b o u r n e vs
RSM:
A couple of points::
i) Congratulations on a fantastic victory
over Cambourne. Long live tradition and
beer fights in the Union Bar.
ii) Apologies to everyone travelling to
Harlington for the matches against Cam-
bourne. Due to an honest administrative
error s o m e problems were experienced
with the coaches. Hopefully by the time that
Felix goes to print the post-event problems
will have been resolved and w e can live in
peace and harmony once more.
iii) If a n y o n e was o f f e n d e d by the
absence o f the DP(C&S) at'the matches
then I must apologise. I had every intention
of being there to cheer RSM on but navi-
gating the w o m e n s minibus until 4:30am
on Saturday morning unfortunately got the
better of me. Just thought I'd let you know...

Cryptic Cock-ups
Dear Felix,
I write with reference to Gnat Chum's Cryp-
tic Crossword. The crossword is normally
excellent, and provides a most stimulating
distraction during Monday's afternoon lec-
tures. However, I can't be alone in noticing
that the clues arc becoming increasingly rid-
dled with typographical errors. A typo such
as replacing a double '!' with a single T is
confusing, particularly in an anogramatical
clue, and you should realy (sic) appreciate
this. Worse still, accepting the presence of
mistakes will encourage the reader to ques-
tion the accuracy o f correctly presented
clues.
The answers given the following w e e k
are often roughly accurate (1136: India for
Indian and Parsonage for Parsonages). Fur-
thermore, in 1136,1 was somewhat thrown
by Gnat Chum's geography. Ihe clue "Four
teas with sugar in a trench town" should
perhaps read "....in a German town", unless
there exists a second Stuttgart about which
I a m unaware.
Yours etc.

Praise from Patrickson
Dear Felix
I feel that I have a f e w things to say. Natu-
rally, I'm disappointed at not being elected
but I congratulate Tasha o n landing the
Presidency. I'm sure the Union will b e in
safe hands next year. The Presidential race
brought out a lot of g oo d points and strong
views that I hope will b e followed up on -
It would be a shame to waste all the ideas
that were generated.'
Various students have had words o f
commiseration for m e today and s o m e
had harsh words to say about St. Mary's. I'd
really appreciate it if this stopped. I think
members of the Mary's campus are only
protecting their interests. All those that
voted on the South Ken campus can have
a slight gripe but for those that didn't, you
have nothing t o complain about. I don't
really want to use the term block vote but
I will - it's not impossible for any group of
people t o mobilise a block vote if they
really want to. I do not personally advocate
It (naturally) I'm just saying that any cam-
pus/department is capable of doing it. Per-
haps this is s o m e t h i n g that those w h o arc
here next year should think about it w h e n
the elections c o m e round again. The point
is though, that I don't wish the graphical rep-
resentation of the votes to be just more fuel
to the fire that fights integration.
I'd like to e n d o n a personal note. I
thank ail those that contributed to my cam-
paign, both emotionally a n d physically.
There w e r e so many people that helped
that I can never really repay all of them. I
was always told it was w r o n g to single any
o n e person out for praise as it belittles oth-
ers efforts. However, I don't believe in that.
There was s o m e o n e that sacrificed a lot of
time and effort, w h o faced the wind tun-
nel that is the walkway, w h o e n d e d days
smelling like a mixture of a print unit and
a blu-tack factory and w h o gave m e confi-
dence and strength w h e n I was over-run
with doubt. Pascalc-thank you.
Well d o n e a n d g o o d luck to the Fab
Five!

Clearer Air in the Union
Dear Felix,
Your throat feels as though it's not felt the
touch of water for years, your eyes sting like
hell and visibility is poor at the very best.
A n d then there are your lungs....
I a m of course talking about the Union.
The W H O L E union. For w h e n the union
b e c o m e s active, a choking, cloaking field
of s m o k e descends u p o n its interior. N o w
I myself have nothing against smokers as
individuals, indeed I have s o m e friends
w h o smoke. But collectively I hate 'ya you
selfish bastards I
The Union last Friday was full of smoke,
everywhere. Previously I had had to leave
Southside at half-time during England v.
France because I couldn't hack the smoke
anymore (ok so maybe leaving at half-time
â€¢ wasn't such a bad idea anyway). I a m not
the only non-smoker w h o has reservations
over passive smoking. I hope I a m not the
only student w h o will speak out against it.
I will not be forced to smoke - passively
or otherwise. The air in London is bad
e n o u g h as it is. Should people like myself
be Inclined to stay away from the union
because of this?
I'm not saying s m o k i n g should b e
banned - but designate s o m e areas non-
smoking or at least get some decent air-con-
ditioning in and prove to us that the union
isn't run by a bunch of insensitive grippers.
