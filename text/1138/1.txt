Humiliation for Cambourne
The Royal School of M i n e s completed a
breathtaking whitewash of the Cambourne
Miners in this year's installment of the infa-
mous Bottle Match.
Over a hundred spectators gathered
to watch the RSM squad complete victories
in every sport contested - M e n ' s Hockey,
Football, Squash, W o m e n ' s Hockey a n d
Rugby. This historic victory means that R S M
will keep hold of the Bottle for yet another
year - and prompted calls for C a m b o u r n e
to "send real players next year".
Having secured victory by a score o f 3-
2 in Squash the night before, the crowds
gathered o n 20 February to see the bulk of
the action. First u p w a s t h e W o m e n ' s
Hockey, w h e r e the Cornish Miners w e r e
totally outclassed by the ICside. However,
despite their obvious superiority, R S M h a d
trouble inside their o p p o n e n t s D, a n d
eventually the match was decided by a soli-
tary goal. A superb cross from Stephane
Dawson w a s converted by captain Karina
Tarllng, to give R S M their first ever win in
Bottle Match history.

affair, although the final scoreline proved
to b e a n identical 1-0. The solitary goal
c a m e after a cynical C a m b o u r n c tackle
gave the M i n e s a penalty early o n in the
second-half, a n d the resulting flick w a s
easily converted.
At 3-0 up, everyone's minds turned to
thoughts o f a possible whitewash, but
until the 80th minute o f the Football, it
looked like this dream w o u l d e n d with a
hardfought draw. Eventually, however, a
long ball took their defence by surprise, to
give RSM another 1-0 victory.
Before the game, the Rugby (the Bot-
tle Match itself) was regarded as RSM's
toughest challenge. It proved to be no
such thing. Outclassing C a m b o u r n e in
every department - driving their pack back
on every scrum and running rings around
their back line - victory was never in doubt.
The final score was 30-10; the crowd went
wild and C a m b o u r n e were humiliated.
