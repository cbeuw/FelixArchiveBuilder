GENE
• • • •
To appreciate a n a l b u m like this
y o u n e e d t o be three things:
Is this the new hard nut image
for Gene? Give It up you
wusses.
(a) A thinker
(b) A dreamer
(c) A romantic.
If y o u are not any o f these things
then I c a n assure y o u that y o u w o n t like
this a l b u m . If o n the, other h a n d y o u
are, then read o n .
With t h e genius o f Martin Rossiter
at t h e h e l m a n d a truly fantastic band
behind h i m , y o u can be sure that a G e n e
a l b u m will never disappoint. C o m p a r -
isons m a d e in t h e past about t h e simi-
larities in singing styles o f Rossiter a n d
Morrisey could still b e m a d e here but
there is o n e crucial difference...Gene do
It better, a lot better.
Each track gives t h e listener a tiny
glimpse into t h e m i n d o f Rossiter. H e
sings with a p h e n o m e n a l a m o u n t of pas-
sion w h i c h is, in m y opinion, always a bit
of a novelty a n d s o m e t h i n g often lacking
in t h e m a n y of today's bands. The prob-
lem that arises from the complexity of an
intelligent a l b u m like Revelations is that
y o u cannot expect to pick it up, listen to
it o n c e a n d love it immediately. This is an
a l b u m that needs just that little bit m o r e
time to get into, but w h e n y o u d o I can
guarantee it'll be worth the effort. You'll
find yourself returning t o it again a n d
again...you could never get bored o f it.
Tracks 3 a n d 13 Love Won't Work
a n d You'll Never Walk Again arc classic
examples o f w h a t G e n e d o best. With
lyrics l i k e ' Is it t o o late to find s o m e o n e ?
I lie in wait t o b e u n d o n e by a n y o n e '
s u n g with the feeling a n d e m o t i o n that
Rossiter is able t o convey b e c o m e truly
soul-touching stuff
There is a lack o f any tracks a b o u t
c o n f u s e d sexuality of the sort that c o u l d
be f o u n d o n G e n e ' s m a s s i v e d e b u t
a l b u m Olympian. They s e e m to b e a
m o r e mature band a n d are n o w c o m -
fortable with subjects like this yet still
never disappoint in the sexy s o n g depart-
ment. In their previous a l b u m Drawn
Into The Deep E n d this c a m e in t h e f o r m
of New Amusements. Here, The Looker
is the glimpse into Rossiters darker, most
lustful side.
M o s t o f the tracks are p u n c h y with
the o d d heart w r e n c h i n g n u m b e r tucked
In b e t w e e n . All contain s o m e t h i n g extra
to m a k e t h e m stand out f r o m t h e rest.
The overall style o f t h e a l b u m is m o r e
akin t o Olympian than Drawn In to The
Deep End. The best t w o tracks, You'll
Never Walk Again a n d Love Won't Work,
are m a d e great by Rossiters a m a z i n g
vocals but w o u l d b e n o t h i n g without the
talent of t h e rest o f the band in t h e rear.
The a l b u m is multipurpose in t h e
sense that, o f t h e 13 tracks available,
y o u always s e e m to b e able t o find o n e
to fit t h e m o o d y o u are in. It is released
o n t h r o u g h Polydor o n M a r c h 1st, a n d
the first single f r o m it As Good As It
Gets, p r o d u c e d b y H u g h Jones, w a s
released o n the 15th of this m o n t h . Their
tour begins Sunday 21 st February at C a m -

Singles
Sheryl Crow - Anything But Down
Including t w o live acoustic tracks, w h i c h is what M s .
Crow excels at, this is w h a t w e ' v e c o m e to expect a n d
there's n o t h i n g n e w here. With a m e l l o w guitar, C o u n -
try drums a n d t h e safe, "I think it's all over n o w love,
so bugger off" lyrics s h e pulls n o p u n c h e s . It's b o u n d
to shift units by t h e bucket load.
Eve 6 - Leech
What is it with acoustic sets this week? Arguably the best
s o n g o n this single is Inside Out a n d not Leech, w h i c h
is in itself a fantastically trashy p o p s o n g in t h e Everclear
vein. It's got a really Infectious chorus c o u p l e d with a
soft verse a n d y o u can't help s i n g i n g to it. But will it b e
a hit? 'Course not, w e ' v e g o t Steps.
The Junket - You're The Same
A n incredibly ear-friendly h o o k paves t h e w a y for t w o
high-energy, funky rock s o n g s . T h e music is tight, a n d
the vocals m a k e n o b o n e s a b o u t having a n English
twang. The only t h i n g that lets this d o w n is that it's o n
vinyl. I m e a n , live in t h e n o w , get a C D b e c a u s e I hate
having to traipse a b o u t h u n t i n g for a record player.
Kent - 747
Not impressed. Only o n e s o n g , a n d t h o u g h that w o u l d
be forgivable if it w a s particularly fine, it's not. Kent are
the whiney bits of James a n d any other "Indie" (my, h o w
that w o r d grates) band y o u c o m e to think of. As s o o n
as 747 starts to g e t going, it finishes. What's all that
a b o u t then?
E S S E N T I A L C H O O N
Inch feat. Mark E. Smith - Inch
Value for m o n e y or what! Five w h o l e tracks s e e m loads
'til y o u notice they're all mixes o f the s a m e s o n g . Is
there such a thing as industrial-bigbeat-mctal? C a n
s o m e o n e invent it please? The beat's t h e centrepiece
here a n d it certainly hits you, along with a raw bass a n d
the mandatory twiddly synth. Purposeful.
Monster Magnet - Space Lord
Multimedia-tastic! There's a Puff Daddy/ Aerosmith-
esque video o n this that is totally cheesy, I love it! Space
Lord is similar t o all o f M o n s t e r M a g n e t ' s previous
stuff, w h a t with their 7 0 s influences, big cars a n d lay-
d e e z but w h o cares. It's self-indulgent, loud a n d a
breath of fresh air from what's a r o u n d at the m o m e n t .
Solvent - Let Me Go
I should like it in principle because it sounds like they're
s u p p o s e d to be Reef-ish but cither the production w a s
crap or t h e b a n d are. The guitars s o u n d like they're
being played through pillows, the drums are actually bis-
cuit tins a n d y o u c a n just tell t h e singer's jiggling about
the studio. Look boys; don't give u p your day jobs. This
is your day job? S h a m e .
The Supernaturals - Everest
Another o n e with o n e track. W h e n will t h e m a d n e s s
end? This is a ballad o f t h e highest proportions (ged-
dit? Everest. I'm w a s t e d here, I really a m ) a n d it's quite
enjoyable. There arc s o m e lovely h a r m o n i o u s vocals
and the lyrics are touchingly normal whilst clever. It's
still not a patch o n Day Before Yesterday's Man t h o u g h .
