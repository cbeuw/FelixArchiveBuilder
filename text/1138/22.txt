SNOOKER FOOTBALL
Extra time winner sends IC to final
BUSA held t h e a n n u a l national s n o o k e r
championships last w e e k e n d . The event
took place in B i r m i n g h a m , Solihull (sic)
a n d lasted three days.
The Imperial Snooker A a n d B t e a m s
were largely different to last year's squad.
Jon Fulcher a n d Richard Turton remained
In t h e A t e a m , with Jon e x p e c t i n g t o w i n
the A t e a m singles c h a m p i o n s h i p this
year after c o m i n g close o n several o c c a -
sions in past years. The rest o f t h e A
team consisted o f several players f r o m
last year's B t e a m w h i c h r e a c h e d t h e
semi-finals. The B t e a m s a w s o m e fresh
faces, but t h e expectations o f r e a c h i n g
the latter stages w e r e still high.

was O K after a bit o f h e a v i n g a n d p u s h -

journey, w e finally m a d e it to t h e Jesse

about 1am.

considerably earlier than s o m e p e o p l e
thought desirable. But w e h a d to get

without further ado, t h e hardcore nutters

The rest o f us set off at a m o r e sedate
pace up t h e Llanberis Path/Motorway t o

proudly o n display, attracting a h u g e
a m o u n t o f attention. N o t h i n g unusual
there, except by this stage they had accu-
m u l a t e d a thick coating o f ice. Lunch
w a s eaten o n t h e w a y d o w n t h e other

with t h e h a r d c o r e nutters, w h o w e r e
desperately trying to keep u p with Tim

was not e n o u g h to keep t h e m a m u s e d
for a w h o l e day, a n d they h a d to g o up
S n o w d o n as well. O n c e at the bottom,
w e ' d planned to take the interesting a n d
remarkably straight path t h r o u g h t h e

it w a s in actual fact an electricity trans-
mission line, a n d o u r tightrope-walking
skills w e r e not really u p to scratch, w e
d e c i d e d to take t h e road instead.
After a quick half in a typically friendly
Welsh pub, it w a s back to the b unk house
to wait for t h e nutters. O n c e again, w e

After t h e meal, w e settled d o w n for a n
excruciating e v e n i n g o f pain a n d exer-

Following t h e nine-goal d e m o l i t i o n o f
the R S M a w e e k earlier, c o n f i d e n c e w a s
high g o i n g into t h e first o f three crucial
matches against UCL.
To say that things weren't g o i n g our
way w o u l d b e a h u g e understatement as
the referee kept a l l o w i n g U C L to kick
lumps out o f most o f our players. W h e n
the referee finally blew for a foul It w a s
to give UCL a penalty after Chris had cun-
ningly let t h e forward into t h e area, a n d
THEN brought h i m d o w n . However, the
deadlock w a s not b r o k e n as Eric saved
the penalty brilliantly.
After about half an hour o f c o n t i n u -
ous battering, Alex finally s n a p p e d a n d
d e c i d e d to take t h e law Into his o w n
hands by flooring a U C L d e f e n d e r with
a right backhand o n the turn w h i c h a n y
boxer w o u l d have b e e n proud of. Again
the ref b l e w for a foul a n d sent Alex o f f
the field.
Despite b e i n g a m a n d o w n , IC still
looked the better side a n d w e r e never
o n everyone's lips, particularly those
w h o h a d d o n e t h e 18 mile, 2,000m
ascent in Tim's wake. Saturday's exertions
called for a m o r e gentle e n d u r a n c e test
o n Sunday, s o w e h e a d e d for M o e l
W n i o n . The weather w a s a but rougher,
with hail showers, but w e still did a g o o d
walk a n d h a d views o f t h e sea. Unfor-
tunately, a large detour in an attempt t o
find a decent place to cross a fast-flow-
ing river meant that w e did not have time
to visit Colwyn Bay o n t h e w a y h o m e .
So t h e n it w a s straight back in t h e
minibus a n d back to L o n d o n a l o n g m y
'clever n e w route' w h i c h led us straight
into a t e n mile tailback o n the M 6 . W e
finally arrived in L o n d o n not l o n g before
midnight, but t h e journeys w e r e well
worth it: definitely o n e o f the better trips.

under threat a n d w e r e unlucky not to
take t h e lead t h r o u g h A m o w h o had a
c o u p l e o f shots b l o c k e d .
In t h e s e c o n d half things w e n t from
bad to w o r s e as U C L scored directly off
a corner, extremely embarrassing for Eric
w h o w a s clearly c o n f u s e d by t h e w i n d
(either that or h e just b u g g e r e d things
up). With 20 mins to g o IC equalised
after a s t u n n i n g m o v e that w a s finished
by So-so.
IC w e r e n o w clearly o n top and were
e v e n getting o n e or t w o decisions from
the referee, a n d in t h e first half o f extra
time, w e n t a h e a d thanks to a deadly
strike f r o m "Dirty" Warren after playing a
nice one-two with Till. The s e c o n d half j
was a different story as UCL threw every- ;
thing they c o u l d at us but t h e solid back
four of Rich, So-so, Chris and Phil refused ;
to break d o w n as w e held out for a vic-
tory that sent t h e " f a n " wild. So IC have
m a d e it t h r o u g h to t h e final for t h e sec- â€¢
o n d year r u n n i n g , hopefully w e will o f
o n e better this year a n d w i n t h e cup. So

For t h e first t i m e since Highlander a n d

pulling session (you k n o w w h o you are!).
After d r a g g i n g Highlander out o f

ball pitch w e f o u n d a shot-put ring -
m u c h t o Baldrich's a m u s e m e n t (she j

lander's dislike o f small balls). Excellent I
performances from t h e scandalous pres-
ident puller ( w h o later tried to pull a
passing cyclist) a n d f r o m t h e rest o f the i
team led to a goal by G o n a d s . Unfor- j
tunately the ref.'s white stick a n d gen- j
eral blindness led t o o u r defeat 3-1 - j
with m a n y a g o o d save by Flo our goalie
( M i k e w o u l d b e p r o u d ) . Hitchhiker j
