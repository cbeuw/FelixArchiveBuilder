Stereophonies, a bunch of
chirpy chappies.
I
r e m e m b e r hearing Local Boy in Ihe
Photograph for the first time - it w a s
o n s o m e r a n d o m indie compilation
of 'one's to watch out for.' I w a s b l o w n
away by it. I w a n t e d to buy their a l b u m
straightaway, only to find that they did-
n't e v e n have a record deal. Since then,
they signed to V2, k n o c k e d up o n e o f
the best out a n d out rock ' n ' roll a l b u m s
of '97 a n d w e r e rewarded for their
extensive touring by n o t c h i n g u p unex-
pectedly high sales. W o r d has a funny
way o f getting around, y o u k n o w .
Performance & Cocktails is their sec-
o n d a l b u m a n d it's a stonker. It's hard to
say h o w m a n y bands like this will be
a r o u n d c o m e the turn o f the millenium.
Rock 'n' roll is c h a n g i n g a n d if there isn't
a searing d r u m loop or r a n d o m vocal
s a m p l e blitzing t h r o u g h the distortion,
p e o p l e don't s e e m to be buying it - it's
a s h a m e really because they're missing
out o n a treat.
Kelly's powerful, gravelly, nicotine-
stained, throat-scratching v o i c e pulls
everything together quite nicely, the first
two singles s h o w h o w h e c a n c h a n g e
f r o m o n e style to the other w h i l e still
maintaining his distinctly recognisable
warble. H e ram-raids his w a y through
The Bartender a n d The Thief w h i c h I'm
c o n v i n c e d Is about t w o lesbians, while
quietly building o n a soulful verse into a
s c r e a m i n g chorus o n Just Looking.
Singles a r c scattered throughout this
a l b u m like sabbatical election posters
o n the walkway. / Wouldn't Believe Your
Radio s o u n d s like a distant cousin o f the
Manics' cover o f Raindrops Keep falling
On My Head. Is Yesterday Tomorrow's
Today? is probably t h e biggest single
here a n d its radio-friendly nature will
probably m e a n a high chart entry (even
t h o u g h the charts m e a n next to n o t h i n g
nowadays). Hurry Up and Wait is another
o n e o f those soul-searching n u m b e r s
akin t o o n e o f their previous singles,
Traffic. T-Shirt Suntan could b e s e e n as
standard rock fare but there's s o m e t h i n g
special there that y o u can't quite put
your finger o n . S o m e b a n d s have it,
s o m e bands don't. The Stereophonies
have it a n d unlike t h e first a l b u m , they
n o w k n o w h o w to u s e it.
I finish with a plea for an e n d a n -
g e r e d species. The tigers o f rock ' n ' roll
are dying out or b e i n g killed off. Don't let
them die. Fight for your right to rock.
True, y o u c o u l d easily call this a l b u m
Word Gets Around Again but as s o m e
bloke o n c e said, 'If it ain't broke, don't
fix it, b a b y . ' E l

SLEATER KINNEY
The Hot Rock
Q-BURNS ABSTRACT MESSAGE
Feng Shui No Stars
Sleater Kinney - they
raaaawwwkk.
S
leater-Kinney. Sounds a bit like a
law firm, doesn't it? A reputation
and a g o o d n a m e built o n pro-
fessional dependability a n d g o o d taste.
It's actually a female trio, w h i c h I always
have a lot o f t i m e for, f r o m the U.S. a n d
they're a H o l e (sic) lot better than
another b a n d that I'm not g o i n g to
m e n t i o n in this review. For those o f y o u
that w e r e lucky e n o u g h to hear their
first release o n British soil, Dig Mc Out,
you'll already k n o w that they rock out
like the proverbial bastard.
It'd be unfair to say that they haven't
progressed, but it is quite obvious that
this is the s a m e band that graced o n our
shores in '97. They're sarcastic a n d cut-
ting e d g e . They're exuberant in a violent
sort of way. Their guitars flirt with y o u
with their stop-start jutting before g o i n g
for the jugular with frighteningly simple
hooks. They have an adorable w a y of
t w i n n i n g dual vocal a n d guitar action
a n d w h e n this is executed they produce
the most exhilarating flashpoints of the
a l b u m - Burn Don't Freeze a n d One
Song for You being glorious examples of
this thrilling interplay.
They have g r o w n u p a bit, t h o u g h .
Not a lot, m i n d - just a bit. There is defi-
nitely a tighter feel to s o m e of the tracks.
It's a fact that it took twice as long as to
record as Dig Mc Out. However, w h e n
that time is clocked in at three a n d a half
w e e k s , y o u won't be c h a n g i n g that rad-
ically- it's still smashy, it's still trashy, it's
still shouty, it's still pouty, it's still punk
that g o e s straight for the throat, it still
gets y o u excited a n d it still resonates with
sharp sassiness. Sleater-Kinney - not a law
firm, then. Just a greatly underrated punk-

W
hen I first received this a l b u m ,
I immediately thought 'What a
stupid n a m e for a group, I
w o n d e r if the a l b u m will be just as bad'.
I wasn't let d o w n . This a l b u m takes the
w o r d poor to n e w d i m e n s i o n s , but in
the interests o f journalism, I forced
myself to listen to the w h o l e bloody
thing. W h y is it so bad then? All the
tracks o n the a l b u m feature very simple
s o u n d s using synths, guitars, drums,
s o m e sort of giant w i n d c h i m e a n d ,
occasionally, vocals. N o w , what m a k e s
this a l b u m so bad, is that all the tracks
s o u n d exactly the s a m e ; y o u d o n ' t
k n o w w h e n o n e track has finished a n d
another o n e has b e g u n (and no the
a l b u m is not mixed!). There are eleven
tracks o n this a l b u m , a n d it s e e m s that
Q-burns have m a d e n o attempt at
d o i n g anything original or creative, a n d
have simply used the 'cut a n d paste'
option o n whatever music p r o g r a m m e
they h a p p e n e d t o be using as m u c h as
possible. In fact, it s e e m s that absolute-
ly n o time has b e e n taken over this
a l b u m - the w h o l e thing w a s probably
created d u r i n g a c o m m e r c i a l break in
the middle o f Richard a n d Judy. It d o e s -
n't make easy listening, b e c a u s e the
tracks 'do your f****n' h e a d in', nor is it
dance or indie. Basically, the tracks arc
m a d e up of simple beats ( w h e n they
a p p e a r ) a n d the most s i m p l e s t o f
strings, m o r e often than not, c o m b i n e d
with triangles a n d strange beeps. The
'vocals' consist o f out o f tune words,
t h o u g h m o r e often they consist o f
strange w a i l i n g s o u n d s . I guess if y o u
like minimalist s o u n d s (and talent) then
this is the a l b u m for y o u . If Q-burns'
abstract m e s s a g e is that these 'sounds'
are s o m e sort o f musical statement
then it is t o o abstract for a n y o n e to pick
up o n . If, however, the abstract mes-
sage Is that Q-burns have n o musical
talents w h a t s o e v e r then they have hit
the nail o f t h e h e a d . Absolutely pathet-
