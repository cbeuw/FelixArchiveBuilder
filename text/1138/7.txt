Elections are Over
I wanted to avoid the subject, but it's
time for a little chat. Firstly, congratu-
lations and all that to the five of you.
There are still a few mumblings in the
bowels of IC about vote rigging, unfair
campaigning and suchlike, but I think
it's safe to say elections are over.
Let's be honest, though; many of
you non-medics are not happy with
the outcome. Many of you are scream-
ing 'block vote' and cursing the ICSM
Exec under your breath. I think much of
what Dennis says in his letter opposite
is right. I also think that if the medics
did all vote for Natasha simply because
she is 'one of them' and to protect
medical interests, they are likely to be

The job of ICU President is to pro-
tect the interests of all IC students,
regardless of their department or CCU.
Departments and CCUs have their own
representatives - ICSM have a full time
sabbatical officer. When Andy Heeps
was elected certain Union hacks trem-
bled at the prospect of ICU being taken
over by ICSM. It didn't happen. In the
registry a sabbatical officer is listed as
an 'interdepartmental postgraduate'.
You leave your departmental and other
prejudices behind when you sign the
contract. I hope that everyone will
remember that.
If the medics want to vote for a
medic, I can't see a problem, as long
as they remember that officer repre-

sents ICU, not ICSM. Likewise I hope
that the reverse prejudice, which still
lurks in hacks' corners in ICU, can be
put aside. Judge sabbatical officers on
how they do the job, when they are
doing it. I would be the first to admit
that when Dave Hellard was elected
last year, I was sceptical. I am pleased
to say that my scepticism was unwar-
ranted, and that I have been proven
wrong. Becoming a sabb changed the
way I acted and thought about stu-
dents, ICU, and ICSTM. O n c e again
may I wish Natasha, Tim, Ian, Kevin
and Dave all'the best. No doubt Felix,
and its readers, will form opinions
about you next year. Until then (and
probably not then anyway), I'm saying
nothing more on the subject.

Forget Drugs... Don't Sleep!
No more e***"**s this year means no
more fortnights from hell for Felix,
which is undoubtedly a good thing.
O n e thing I will miss, though, is the
post-tiredness adrenaline trip - that
weird hallucinogenic state you enter
when you stay up for thirty hours, get
two hours sleep, and then stay awake
for another twenty-four. I have not
experienced it in its full 'is that a rabbit
or a Volvo?' splendour since the regu-
lar clubbing days of my first year. So
sorry if I bumped into anyone last week
and murmured an apology about lamp-
posts. If you get regular sleep and have
never experienced it, try it out - before
that nine to five office job starts. - Ed
