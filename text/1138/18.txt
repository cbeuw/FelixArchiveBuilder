Last Saturday G u r m a n d I wit-
nessed an e p o c h - m a k i n g event - t h e
last (see poster) ever Heavenly Social
at Turnmills. This w a s the night that
had introduced the C h e m i c a l Brothers
(then still k n o w n as t h e Dust Brothers),
pushed poppers into m a i n s t r e a m club-
culture again, a n d also w i t n e s s e d t h e
fall of the "heavenly bottles". '
While the clubs decor is varied a n d
interesting, in s o m e places it is literally
falling o f f t h e walls - it certainly n e e d s
a lick of paint. H o w e v e r y o u don't g o
clubbing for the wallpaper (unless
you're particularly weird), y o u g o for
the beats. A n d the beats w e r e here in
force - after a l o n g build u p . To b e
honest the m a i n acts b e f o r e t h e Broth-
ers a p p e a r e d w e r e fairly d i s a p p o i n t i n g .
This could be a s y m p t o m o f t h e fact
that it is very hard for t h e c r o w d t o
see the DJs a n d visa versa - t h e b o o t h
is almost c o m p l e t e l y blacked out a n d
raised well a b o v e the m a i n dancefloor.
Turnmills d o say they will b e r e m o v i n g
the blacked o u t glass s o a little m o r e
c o m m u n i c a t i o n can take place. But o n
the night, it turned out that t h e m o r e
chilled out a n d funky s e c o n d a r y d a n c e
floor w a s a far better choice.
The tension before the Chemicals
arrived w a s palpable - the Heavenly
faithful w e r e out in force a n d they
h e l p e d w h i p the others into a frenzy -
so m u c h s o that w h e n o n e poor bloke
h a d t o fiddle with s o m e lights o n the
dancefloor o n a step ladder he w a s
given a standing ovation f r o m the rest
o f t h e club! The Bros, w h i p p e d out a
blinding set, over 3 hours in total -
including all the old favourites a n d , if I
a m not very m u c h mistaken a c o u p l e
o f brand n e w DATs doubtless to
included in the l o n g awaited n e w
a l b u m .
The night w a s given an a d d e d
t o u c h o f hilarity by the antics o f G u r m
"Klinsman" M a r w a h a w h o ' s heroics for
the IC "Disco Boys" IV's resulted in a
severely bruised l e g a n d a pair o f
crutches - w h e n w e entered the club
the p r o m o t e r s h o u t e d after us "you'll
be n e e d i n g m o r e than the crutches by
the e n d o f t h e night mate!". G u r m did
h o w e v e r put t h e crutches t o g o o d u s e
- in a c o u p l e o f failed chat u p attempts
a n d several visits t o the (very nice)
b o g s - w h e r e u p o n security cleared a
path t h r o u g h the q u e u e s straight to a
cubical just for h i m . A h h h h .
O n exiting the club at the e n d o f a
truly titanic night w e w e r e all h a n d e d
little g o o d y bags o f f u n - including fly-
ers a n d a T-shirt advertising the n e w
replacement night for the Heavenly at
Turnmills. Its called "Headstart" a n d
promises to be a "proper club for
proper clubbers" - for m o r e details s e e
the flyers o n this p a g e or call 0171 250
3409. N i c e s h . Also contained in this lit-
tle b a g of fun w a s a letter f r o m all the
p e o p l e w h o h a d h e l p e d put the Social
together - o n e o f the most heartfelt
a n d t o u c h i n g things I have read in a
l o n g time. Y o u can tell the Heavenly
m e a n t a lot to a lot o f people.
I can't wait for the second s t
coming. $ - ^ f H f •

Prodigy Presents:
The Dirtchamber Sessions Volume 1
It's hard to imagine, but back in the
80's, l o n g b e f o r e t h e Prodigy, Liam
Howlett w a s a DJ in the Essex Hip-Hop
band Cut to Kill. H e o n c e entered a
Capital Radio m i x i n g c o m p e t i t i o n ,
d e c i d e d that t h e tape h e h a d submitted
w a s shit, a n d sent o f f another o n e . The
two tapes w o n first prize a n d third prize.
T h e D i r t c h a m b e r Sessions V o l u m e 1
demonstrates that Howlett has lost n o n e
o f t h e o l d m i x i n g skills. T h e a l b u m
started off as a session recorded for Mary
A n n e H o b b ' s Breezeblock s e g m e n t o n
Radio 1 a n d is a trip t h r o u g h the s o u n d s
that have i n f l u e n c e d the Prodigy into
the b a n d that they are. The music g o e s
t h r o u g h a h u g e s p e c t r u m o f g e n r e s
including raw hip-hop, e d g y rock a n d
O l d Skool beats. Howlett has used s o m e
quality tracks, i n c l u d i n g t u n e s by t h e
Charlatans. The mixing is superb, a n d it's
a m a z i n g h o w Howlett has m a n a g e d to
put It all together. A great a l b u m for fans
of all kinds o f m u s i c '

(4AD)
T h e s t r a n g e , e c e l e c t i c Icelanders
return w i t h their latest o f f e r i n g ,
'Ladyshave'. It's a very vocal single with
s i m p l e beats a n d eclectic s o u n d s ,
a l t h o u g h it is different f r o m their earlier
releases. O d d l y e n o u g h , t h e lass w h o
sings o n this s o u n d s very similar to Bjork.
It c o m e s over 2 CD's a n d has plenty of
remixes, w h i c h sadly all s o u n d pretty
similar. But as a single the track is great
a n d will b e out in the next c o u p l e o f
w e e k s o n 4 A D records. They're playing
at U L U o n the 26th, a n d Felix will be
reviewing t h e g i g s o o n .
