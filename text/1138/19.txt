i C a r w a s h - t h e n a m e itself h a s
I b e c o m e s y n o n y m o u s with d i s c o a n d
j funk throughout the UK. N o w in their
i tenth year, w e w e n t to c h e c k out w h a t
all the fuss w a s a b o u t at their h o m e
venue, the LA2.1 say this 'cos they often
play away, s t a g i n g e v e n t s across t h e
• country, t h r o u g h o u t c l u b l a n d , a n d at
s o m e o f the larger a n d m o r e funky stu-
dent unions. If only our's w a s so - shame.
N o w t h e first thing that y o u have t o

'Carry O n '
(Columbia/Reverb)
Lifted f r o m S h a z z ' s e p o n y m o u s
debut, this single, featuring C h a r m a i n e
King o n vocals, doesn't d o h i m or his
a l b u m any justice. T h e production m a y
be polished, as y o u w o u l d expect, but
the tune just doesn't cut it. The blurb
describes it as "mid-tempo h o u s e " with
"considerable dancefloor energy," but
I'd say it s o u n d s as lethargic as student
o n a Sunday m o r n i n g . I can't really Imag-
ine this giving a n y dancefloor a blast o f
energy. But all Is not lost, 'cos If y o u play
this at +8 o n your decks then it begins to
s o u n d alright - f u c k k n o w s w h y they
deal with o n a trip to Carwash, is the
dress code. The door policy is strict a n d
only those o f y o u w h o m a k e the effort
will m a k e it in. N o w s o m e p e o p l e m a y
m o a n that strict d o o r policies arc a b a g
of shite, but it's the p e o p l e w h o m a k e
Carwash the night that it is, so y o u only
w a n t t h o s e w h o are willing to m a k e a n
effort to'make it past the door. You don't
want any old scruffy geezers making it in
'cos it just w o u l d n ' t be fair o n every-
b o d y else. A n d o n c e you're inside you'll
s e e w h a t it is really like - funkarama. S o
to e n s u r e all y o u d i s c o chicks a n d
funksters get in, here's an insiders guide
to, well, h o w to get in (provided by the
m a n a g e m e n t themselves). The following

buy this o n vinyl a n d crank it up. Don't
g o near the C D though, or y o u might just
fall asleep.

'Colour the World'
(Multiply Records)
The Euro-house king's latest single is,
strangely e n o u g h , a Euro-house tune
incorporating African vocals a n d sounds.
It's very different f r o m t h e stuff he's
r e l e a s e d in t h e last c o u p l e o f years,
w h i c h has always h a d those c h e e s y
vocals. 'Colour the World' features vocals
lions, Nike, Adidas, a n d Fila Trainers,
Tacky Cheesy 70s.
N o w that those necessary techni-
calities are out of the w a y let's move onto
what the night itself is really like. Was it
up to all the hype? YES. Everything just
slots into place o n c e y o u d e s c e n d d o w n
those steps into the LA2. The m a i n bar
area is a s e a of UV light, w h e r e every-
one's already funky outfits b e c o m e even
more groovy, a n d the fluorescent cups
and bar area also m a k e for a nice t o u c h .
This is a g o o d place to chill-out a n d enjoy
the alternative 70s reality w h i c h is Car-
wash. But there is an u n e x p e c t e d twist
to this r o o m - after a while they start to
p u m p out the g r u n g e (!) (Nirvana, Rage
Against the M a c h i n e ct al.), in w h a t I
think is a bizarrely c u n n i n g w a y o f get-
ting all the punters d o w n to the main
danccfloor. It didn't work 'cos s o m e of
t h e m just regressed to their instinct-dri-
v e n t e e n a g e years a n d started m o s h i n g
around. There w a s only so m u c h o f that
w h i c h I could take, so I d e c i d e d to v e n -
ture downstairs.
A n d at the main dancefloor it didn't
s e e m as if they n e e d e d a n y e n c o u r a g e -
ment to stay. It w a s packed, but with slill
e n o u g h r o o m for everyone t o strut their
funky stuff (except for the p o d i u m s
w h e r e s o m e strategic p u s h i n g w a s
n e e d e d to let your talents show). This
a n d s o u n d s from Africa, a n d Sash has
tried to incorporate these into a Luro-
house-type tune. It works quite well,
but it's not as g o o d as the stuff h e used
to m a k e a n d doesn't feature the t h u m p -
ing bass lines that trademark Sash's
tunes. C o m e s with three remixes - the
tune is out in the next m o n t h .

D a Book
'A B o m b from a I riend'
Weird, but g o o d tunc, this track is
a hybrid o f hip-hop s o u n d s a n d garage-
beats that works quite well. O n the o n e
hand, w e have slow vocals whilst o n the
main a r e n a is arranged o n several dif-
ferent levels with p o d i u m s galore, plenty
of spaces to rest after your exertions, a n d
a w i c k e d g u y o n t h e b o n g o s (this time
c o m p l e m e n t i n g the music).
This is a class act t h r o u g h a n d
through. From the professional dancers
(a chick b o y w e a r i n g a pair o f white
fluffy s p e e d o s , a n d a girl with a Bucks
Fizz-like strip routine), to the groovy sets,
mixed by residents Charlie Angel, Dexter,
a n d The Disco Kid, this really is Disco and
f u n k for C l u b b e r s . A n d it never gets
cheesy despite b e i n g a 70s night. This is
not shitty s t u d e n t u n i o n / o f f i c e party
music for the masses, but rather a great
b l e n d o f classic d i s c o a n d 90s club
remixes o f funk/disco tunes.
O n e o f the best nights I've b e e n to
in the capital, 'cos it's just so m u c h f u n .
If y o u want a break from serious, hard-
core d a n c e music then g o to Carwash
a n d just groove without a care in the
w o r l d . C h e c k out their d o u b l e C D t o o -
it's lush.
Boogie Nights.

other, the beat is almost garage style.
The track c o m e s with three mixes, o n e
w h i c h is a garage version a n d while the
other two have d e e p , slow vocals o n a
hip-hop s o u n d i n g beat. O u t in the next
m o n t h , it's a tune worth c h e c k i n g out.
