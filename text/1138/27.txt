WHO CAN I TALK TO?
David Allman
Studying a n d
living at univer-
sity can some-
times be
stressful a n d
lonely as well as
challenging and
exciting. The
courses at
Imperial C o l -
lege are
demanding;
they require
commitment of
time and effort.
It's not unusual
to experience a
knock to your self-esteem to find yourself
amongst similarly intelligent students after
having been at or near the top of your class
at school.
You might have arrived at Imperial from
another country with different social and
cultural norms, so that part of beginning at
College involves the experience of living in
a different culture. Family and friends may
be a long distance away. And if you're com-
ing to College straight from home you may
have to learn the practicalities of everyday
living as well! Coming to university might be
one of the biggest transitions you're going
to make in your life.
If you're not used to organising yourself and
getting on with studying without a parent or
teacher prompting you, it can be a consid-
erable challenge to manage your work. O n
the other hand, sometimes students work too
hard and get diminishing returns; fear of fail-
ure or 'letting people down' can get in the
way of constructive studying.
Sometimes personal issues demand energy
which you would otherwise be using to get
on with your life. Sometimes you'll know what
the problem is, eg a relationship difficulty,
a bereavement, an issue about self-confi-
dence. But sometimes you might be aware
of feeling depressed or anxious, of finding
it difficult to concentrate at lectures or when
studying, for no immediately identifiable rea-
son.
Many students find it useful to come to
counselling when they're feeling troubled, to
talk about their experience, to think through
a problem, and to consider options and
create a strategy to move forward. Issues stu-
dents bring include; blocks to studying and
exam stress; relationship difficulties; family
difficulties; homesickness; loneliness; depres-
sion; anxiety; bereavement; sexuality and
sexual orientation.
Martin Thomson
The Union
has an
elected, non-
sabbatical,
welfare c o m -
mittee w h o
are responsi-
ble for taking
up issues of
concern to
students o n
welfare mat-
ters (these
would be
issues related
to the experi-
ence of
studying at IC rather than specific legal or
personal problems). The Union Welfare
Committee needs your input in order to
represent your best interests and respond
to your concerns. You can contact the
Welfare Officer via the Union Office. As
well as the Welfare Officer himself, the
Union has a plethora of elected officers
looking out for your interests, including
a c c o m m o d a t i o n , equal opportunities,
women's and Constituent College Union
Welfare officers.
A full-time adviser, Martin Thomson, is
employed in the Union to provide a pro-
fessional advice service to students and
staff. The Advice Office has a very broad
information system (which includes a full
Citizen's Advice Bureau information data-
base) and Martin has several years of gen-
eral advice experience.
If you have a problem of any kind, or you
just want information on a particular topic,
then he should be able to either assist you
or, where necessary, refer you to an appro-
priate source outside of the College. The
service is free, confidential and impartial
(which means that no matter what your
problem or situation is, you will receive
unbiased assistance, not judgmental ques-
tions).
Matters frequently dealt with include hous-
ing problems, immigration, consumer mat-
ters, debt, and fundraising (for students who
run out of money toward the end of their
studies). In addition to leaflets on the above
there is a broad range of free information
available in the Union reception which
includes material on health matters, ben-
efits, income tax a n d the small claims
court.
To see Martin, you should make a n
appointment at the Union Office (x48060)
or contact him directly.
The CCUs
It may seem sometimes that there's never
anyone to talk to when you need advice.
Sure, your tutor helps you with your work,
your flatmates attempt to revive your flag-
ging social life, and your parents send you
emergency cash if you're lucky, but all the
other stuff that you either can't ask or don't
know how... All of the benefits of the pol-
icy and initiatives from ICU's hard-work-
ing welfare committee are readily available
to you, and you only need to ask. It's easy
enough to email welfare@ic.ac.uk, and
your emails to welfare are guarded by a
policy of confidentiality.
Your own constituent college also has a
representative - if you don't know whether
your particular issue is something that
welfare can deal with, or you just want to
know exactly what you're entitled to, you
should enquire with your C C U welfare
rep, a n d they'll put you straight. They
should have a pigeon-hole in your C C U
office (and if you haven't found that yet,
you've definitely been studying far too
hard...!). Alternatively, contact details can
be found in the ICU H a n d b o o k , available
from Union reception, or on your C C U ' s
website.
