Glaxo Unwelcome
Following last w e e k ' s front page article,
'Glaxo W e l c o m e Mary's', Felix has b e e n
contacted by Professor M a l c o l m G r e e n ,
Vice-Principal for Postgraduate M e d i c i n e at
St Mary's. What follows are extracts f r o m
the letter h e sent us. Felix w o u l d like t o
state that our sources for the article printed
last w e e k w e r e reliable. However, at t h e
time of g o i n g to press w e w e r e unable to
verify the exact truth o f t h e matter. W e
h o p e to resolve the issue o n e w a y or t h e
other next week.
Professor M a l c o m G r e e n :
"Your front page article o n the future
o f St Mary's C a m p u s is a n astonishing
mixture o f inaccuracy a n d fabrication.
The facts, as any of us w o u l d have will-
ingly confirmed, are these.
In the s u m m e r a n d early a u t u m n o f
last year m a n y o f t h e scientists with their
research and teaching groups m o v e d from
the St Mary's C a m p u s building t o t h e n e w
BMS building at South Kensington. Teach-
ing continues o n the site, but s o m e o f the
teaching activities have transferred. T h e
By the News Team
result is that there are large tracts of the
building w h i c h are vacant, a n d not up to
m o d e r n standards for research a n d teach-
ing. It w o u l d b e tragic to see the building
remain in this condition, a n d degenerate
into sparsely o c c u p i e d o l d age.
The p r o b l e m w a s recognised s o m e
time a g o a n d w e applied to the University
f u n d i n g Council (HEFCE) a n d w e r e suc-
cessful in obtaining funds to refurbish part
of the 4th floor for m o d e r n laboratories,
for virology research. Work o n this will
start s o o n .
Conversion of buildings is expensive.
N o substantial capital monies w e r e avail-
able within IC following completion of the
BMS building. Fortunately, however, in
the s u m m e r o f 1998 t h e G o v e r n m e n t
a n n o u n c e d a £600M f u n d to be c o m -
peted for nationally to help refurbish the
infrastructure o f UK Universities. 5 0 % of
this m o n e y c a m e from central Govern-
ment, a n d 5 0 % from the W e l l c o m e Trust,
an independent medical charity. It is pos-
sible that this is w h e r e the confusion with
GlaxoWellcome c a m e In, although there
is n o w no association b e t w e e n the phar-
maceutical firm a n d the W e l l c o m e Trust,
which is an independent charity. A bid for
up to £26M w a s put in by Imperial College
on behalf of the St. Mary's building in
December to this Joint Infrastructure Fund
(JIF). If the full m o n e y is granted, it should
allow complete refurbishment of the build-
ing, with n e w state of the art research a n d
teaching facilities. O f course it is possible
that the bid will not succeed, or that a
lesser s u m will be allocated in w h i c h case
there will need to b e partial solutions.
If JIF funds w e r e awarded, detailed
planning w o u l d need to take place. H o w -
ever, the bid does not include any pro-
posal to a b a n d o n the s w i m m i n g pool or
library. O n the other hand, the fully funded
bid does include a proposal to build a
n e w light a n d airy building in the central
courtyard to contain bar, eating a n d other
