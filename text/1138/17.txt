y friend w e n t to s e e this film.
Well, h e wasn't exactly m y
i friend - I met this bloke in a
pub and his cousin swore he h a d seen it.
He told m e that It is t h e latest o f those
teen horror films m a d e by former video
shop attendants w h o fill a n hour-and-a-
half with t h e best scenes f r o m their
favourite movies, pausing only to a d d a
liberal dash o f irony before serving the
result to t h e c i n e m a g o i n g public. I did-
n't believe h i m at first, b u t then h e
revealed that Urban Legend is so-called
because t h e unfortunate college stu-
dents at the centre o f its macabre plot
meet their untimely e n d s in t h e m a n n e r
of those contemporary folk tales w h i c h
have mysteriously entered our collective
consciousness. N o w I w a s interested.
After all, everyone has heard o f the
babysitter w h o receives p h o n e calls threat-
ening the children in her care a n d then
discovers that they are originating in the
upstairs b e d r o o m , a n d w h a t about t h e
numerous unpleasant stories o f food con-
tamination? W h o ' s to say w h i c h rat-found-
in-burger variants are actually true a n d
which are t h e result o f a fertile imagina-
tion a n d a desire to discredit a fast f o o d
conglomerate? It s o u n d e d like the perfect

premise for a self-reverential horror film in
the vein o f Scream, with the b o n u s that,
since urban mythology is almost univer-
sal, y o u don't have to be a die hard devo-
tee o f slasher films to enjoy the ironic
h u m o u r .
The w h o l e thing w a s b e g i n n i n g to
s o u n d extremely plausible, a n d I w a s
finally c o n v i n c e d w h e n s o m e o n e else
described exactly the same film l o m e ,
a d d i n g that the cast features Alicia Witt
(Zoey in TV's CybilD, Rebecca Gayheart
{Scream 2), Jared Leto (My So-Called Life)
a n d Joshua Jackson (Dawson's Creek).
Apparently, there is even a c a m e o
from Nightmare on Elm Streets Freddie,
Robert Englund. This bloke reckoned that
it is hugely entertaining stuff, provided
that y o u s u s p e n d your disbelief to a n
almost reckless extent a n d are willing to
overlook s o m e frighteningly b a d acting.
S o m e h o w performing the feat of being
cleverly executed a n d downright daft at
the same time, he claimed Urban Legend
makes ideal viewing for those w h o don't
take being scared t o o seriously. Great, I
thought, a n d began looking forward to a
trip to the c i n e m a - that w a s until he told

Six m o n t h s a g o , t h e prospect o f a Brit
flick starring Vinnie Jones, Sting and that
b l o k e f r o m Press G a n g (otherwise
k n o w n as Dexter Fletcher), a n d based
a r o u n d g a n g l a n d L o n d o n , hardly
s o u n d e d like it w a s g o i n g to set the
w o r l d alight. Yet just a f e w m o n t h s later
it has b e c o m e o n e o f t h e most suc-
cessful British m o v i e s o f all time, a n d
r e m a k e rights have recently b e e n sold
to T o m Cruise, w h o plans t o star a n d
direct t h e US version.
Even all this success can't allay those
initial d o u b t s over t h e cast - V i n n i c
Jones looks g o o d , largely because no-
o n e else c a n act. Fortunately, however,
that d o e s n ' t matter, as t h e script, a n d
m o r e importantly t h e plotting, are phe-
n o m e n a l l y g o o d . If y o u haven't seen it
already, this is a definite must s e e .
The Castle
W e automatically expect Australian TV to
be a w f u l , y e t naturally a s s u m e their
movies will b e brilliant. M a k e sense o f
that. A n y h o w , The Castle serves to rein-
f o r c e this belief, p r o v i n g t o b e yet

A n t i p o d e a n fare - dysfunctional seven-
ties family the Kerrigans attempt to pro-
tect their h o m e from demolition - it's still
packed with laughs a n d charm.
Lolita
Traditionally o n e o f the most difficult
novels to film, any reworking of Lolita will
always be the focus o f m e d i a attention
d u e to the notorious plot o f Nabakov's
story - a middle-aged professor b e c o m e s
obsessed with a 12 year old girl and mar-
ries her mother so he can be close to her.
In this case, however, director Adrian
Lynne h a n d l e s his material carefully,
pitching the movie as a n extraordinary
love story, rather than a titillating skin-flick.
