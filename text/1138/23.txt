KARTING Sport in Brief
Imperial Ahead of Oxbridge - Official!!
It was a cold, rainy Friday night as seven
plucky IC students t o o k o n the com-
- bined might of 50 - o d d O x b r i d g e stu-
dents in the C U A C Karting e n d u r a n c e
race at Rye House. IC w a s e n t e r i n g t w o
teams, Oxford five, and Cambridge eight.
Originally p l a n n e d as a dry race, cir-
c u m s t a n c e s c h a n g e d as 30 m i n u t e s
before the green flag, it pissed it d o w n !
There was no t i m e to re-prepare the
karts, and no way to chicken out. There
was no two ways about it - this w a s
g o i n g to be FUN!!!!
Under floodlights, the O x f o r d a n d
C a m b r i d g e 1st t e a m s m a d e the early
pace, but soon, the sublime driving from
Phil, Nat and Dan put IC 2nd's into a lead
they w o u l d not relinquish. IC Ist's (the
numbers meant n o t h i n g - it w a s just a
case of w h o s i g n e d o n first), led by Ben,
with Oli, Matt, a n d yours truly, under his
expert guidance, got off to a g o o d start
m o v i n g into 3rd place. A glorious Impe-
rial 1-2 was o n the cards w h e n disaster
struck!! O n e of the Ist's engines w e n t
the way of M i c h a e l S c h u m a c h e r at Spa,
a n d c o m p l e t e l y lost it!! B e i n g twin-
e n g i n e karts, w e m a n a g e d to limp back
to the pits, but a 15-minute stop while
they c h a n g e d the e n g i n e b l e w any
chance of a decent finish.
Through atrocious conditions, s o m e
sensible yet c o m m i t t e d driving by IC 1st
d r a g g e d the t e a m back up the order to
7th place at the 2-hr t i m e limit. N o b o d y ,
h o w e v e r , c o u l d t o u c h the 2nd's w h o
finished three laps a h e a d of the O x f o r d
1st t e a m . Their w i n was underlined by
t a k i n g the fastest lap - Vi a s e c o n d
quicker than IC Ist's w h o w e r e second-
fastest.
So! It's official! IC are way a h e a d of
O x b r i d g e w h e n it c o m e s to the impor-
tant things in life!

LADIES RUGBY
IC Virgins 73 -5 Kings
The Virgins scored big time. From the
m o m e n t w e took the o d d shaped ball in
our h a n d s our e x c i t e m e n t g r e w a n d
grew. The King's players c a m e o n hard
for the first two minutes but they w e r e
p r e m a t u r e a n d w e t o o k t h e m a n d
scored. O u r subs w e r e giving it s o m e
oral o n the sidelines a n d King's kept o n
g o i n g d o w n , d o w n , d o w n . W e p e n e -
trated their defence time and time again,
until they could take n o m o r e .
Their tackles were more playful than
hard so w e s h o w e d t h e m h o w it was
d o n e . Our hookers gave t h e m a run for
their money. We c a m e out of every ruck
a n d maul o n top in, and our studs d u g
in deep as our furry mascot screamed for
m o r e . Shouts of give it in, get your kit
off, drive, s h o w it to me, a n d yes, yes,
yes w h e r e regularly heard from the pitch.
Perv's underwear was o n the pitch, Ali-
son didn't have the horn and flasher did-
n't pull her usual trick.
LADIES HOCKEY
IC 8 - 0 Royal Vets
After starting with only 10 players (cheers
Scully) w e had a stormin' match.
C a m p e d in their 25 for the entire match,
w e spent the first half occasionally giv-
ing the keeper the ball. Wifey m a n -
a g e d to clear up off the pads twice,
leaving it 2-0 at half time.
After sharp w o r d s f r o m Bagpuss, the
2nd half was taken at a difference pace.
Shots w e r e p u m m e l l e d at the keeper
left, right and centre and the o d d f e w
w e n t in. Scully after her late arrival
s c o r e d her first g o a l s i n c e her w i s e
d e f e c t i o n f r o m R S M (that'll b e a jug),
H u m m i n g Bird put in a c o u p l e (jug
avoidance? - I d o n ' t think so I) a n d
Wifey c o m p l e t e d her near d o u b l e hat-
trick finishing in fire.
8-0! it serves y o u Vet sight for s p e n d i n g
all your t i m e with your hands up cows
bottoms.
ULTIMATE FRISBEE
IC 19 - 6 Southampton
After a sedate o p e n i n g match against
Portsmouth Uni, IC Ultimate t e a m w e r e
anticipating a real head-to-head against
the South East c h a m p i o n s Southampton
Uni (Skunks). With an incomplete squad,
including only o n e sub, the o d d s w e r e
in IC's favour from the offset.
A m u c h i m p r o v e d t e a m perfor-
m a n c e a n d a spirited individual display
f r o m John " o n your knees" Taylor (who
caught over 1/2 IC's points), IC walked
away with a convincing victory. A replay
at the National Student Indoor finals in
10 days time may yield a different out-
c o m e !
