Pratt S m a s h e s W a l k i n g R e c o r d
By Ross Newell
This w e e k Dr Pratt s m a s h e d his o w n
record for walking backwards during a lec-
ture. Dr Pratt held t h e previous record for
walking backwards d u r i n g a lecture at
10.7km in a 50 minute lecture. H o w e v e r
on M o n d a y Dr Pratt broke his o w n record,
pushing back all the limits, a n d left the
record standing at 15.8km.
Dr Pratt, w h o likes to b e k n o w n as Dr
Cool (though more c o m m o n l y referred to
as ' O h G o d it's h i m , hide'), is k n o w n a n d
avoided throughout the Shep M a i n Dept
for his unique personality. H e has b e e n
practising backwards walking in t h e Ter-
race Lecture Theatre while n o students are
present (during his lectures). Previously he
had b e e n using t h e linear walk like most
other lecturers, but having mastered this
he turned his attention to the more diffi-
cult cyclic jog.
The linear walk (LW) is the standard
h o m a g e used by the lecturer. Lecturers
are taught t h e LW o n entering the pro-
fession a n d most use n o other. In this
m e t h o d t h e lecturer a p p r o a c h e s t h e
board forwards often b o w i n g to the G o d -
dess o f the Blackboard, Jane. Sometimes
the b o w is disguised as tripping up o n the
bin/chalk/carpet/air. O n c e the blackboard
is reached s o m e sacrificial chalk is offered
using sacred a n d incomprehensible sym-
bols, then the board is retreated from
while still facing the surface in order to
s h o w respect for the great Jane, often
including a large b o w disguised as tripping
over absolutely nothing a n d landing flat
o n their behind. The process is repeated,
all the time chanting complete rubbish.
The cyclic j o g h o w e v e r d o e s n o t
approach the board forward instead the
lecturer walks backwards t o w a r d s t h e
board thus s h o w i n g his or her disrespect
for Jane, a n d continues to walk backward
past the board, often writing s o m e blas-
p h e m o u s symbols o n the board. Then the
board is retreated from in t h e conven-
tional way. finally the lecturer completes
the circle a n d t h e process is repeated.
This system is unpopular because o f
the offence c a u s e d t o Jane a n d often
results in expulsion from the sect o f Acad-
emia. However it d o e s have s o m e per-
f o r m a n c e benefits. Since t h e lecturer
never stops walking a n d always walks in
a backward direction, the distance walked
d u r i n g a lecture is often d o u b l e that
obtainable using a LW a n d h e n c e h a s
b e e n t h e target o f m a n y professional
backwards walkers for s o m e time. N o n e
however have m a n a g e d t o perfect t h e
m e t h o d until n o w .
After 2 years o f practice Dr Pratt has
perfected the backwards walk and put it
into practice in order t o break his o w n
record. During the lecture Dr Pratt walked
in 1456 c o m p l e t e circles all in the reverse
direction. H e used 28,343 footsteps a n d
spoke 123,000 w o r d s explaining what a
w o n d e r f u l person h e is.
During the lecture h e explained h o w
h e h a d single h a n d e d l y solved all Shep
M a i n related p r o b l e m s ever, including
ones previously solved before his birth. He
w e n t o n to say w h a t a wonderful person
he is. H e explained h o w t h e walk w a s
s p o n s o r e d a n d h e w o u l d raise £10,000
p o u n d s for t h e DPAF. H e finished t h e lec-
ture by giving a 15min talk o n h o w w o n -
derful h e is.
The Dr Pratt Awareness Fund (DPAF)
is a charity set u p by Dr Pratt to spread the
w o r d about Dr Pratt a n d all the w o n d e r -
ful things h e does. It organises TV, Radio,
M a g a z i n e a n d ne ws paper interviews for
Dr Pratt, with all procedes from the inter-
views g o i n g to the DPAF. The DPAF is
focusing o n the third world where people
haven't learned to avoid Dr Pratt yet a n d
may still donate m o n e y t o continue his
self p r o m o t i o n c a m p a i g n . T h e DPAF
hopes that eventually there will be n o o n e
w h o d o c s not k n o w about Dr Pratt and he
will b e able to b e o n TV or Radio 24 hours
per day, with a string o f fans following him
a r o u n d explaining what a wonderful per-
son he is.
A l the m o m e n t Dr Pratt has no fans
despite most o f t h e first w o r l d b e i n g
a w a r e o f his existence. S o m e p e o p l e
believe that Dr Pratt m a y b e c o m e m o r e
popular if he had a slightly less obnoxious
personality - n o n e have b e e n able to tell
this to Dr Pratt d u e to his refusal to stop
talking about what a wonderful person he
is.
O n c e the walk w a s over everyone
w e n t to t h e dinner party organised by Dr
Pratt for himself. Everyone ate s o m e food,
drank s o m e drink, listened to Dr Pratt,
kicked his head in a n d w e n t h o m e .
Dr Pratt gives weekly lectures in Ter-
race equation manipulation in the Terrace
Lecture theatre every W e d n e s d a y after-
n o o n . II y o u can, try not to b e there.
