this w i c k e d g r o u p - Syze-
Up.
"I started m e s s i n g about with s o u n d s
about fifteen years a g o in m y garage".
W h e n h e w a s just thirteen Syze-Up
started out Djing, his e q u i p m e n t w a s
pretty basic but he w a s able create loops
using a tape m a c h i n e a n d so started
building a library o f samples. As he g r e w
his skillz b e g a n m o r e a n d m o r e h o n e d ;
he w a s s o o n rocking the hip-hop heads
with his furious turntable talents. He w a s
s o o n frustrated with just Djing a n d it w a s
a natural progression o n to production.
"Basically, Desert Eagle Discs started out
as m y s o u n d system, I used to play out
at this club a n d I invited rappers along to
freestyle over s o m e beats, that's w h e r e
Shari c o m e s in, s h e just j u m p e d u p a n d
started freestyling, I k n e w she w a s s o m e -
t h i n g special straight away". H e ain't jok-
ing her vocals are beautifully sultry a n d
the girl herself is dazzling. Her vocals
over Syze-Up's hard dark beats are a per-
fect match.
..The t w o o f t h e m
searched for a
record deal
t a n d in '96
^they w e r e
[signed to
-Boiler-
P i
Records, they immediately started w o r k
o n their a l b u m . "The a l b u m isn't RnB, I'm
not really in to that side o f t h e music, I
prefer s o m e t h i n g a little harder, m o r e
gutsy, I'm a hip h o p head". Syzc-Up, real
n a m e Simon Ingerfield, w a s
i n f l u e n c e d by h i p h o p greatly, but
w a n t e d to m a k e an a l b u m that s h o w e d
™**v. a darker side of hip h o p beats with
a bluesey feel to t h e m .
"We still w a n t e d
a hip-hop
a l b u m , a n d
that's w h y w e
got 21 soldiers
on a c o u p l e o f
tracks, they're a
y o u n g c r e w
outta Brooklyn,
w h o are o n t h e
w a y u p " . O r i g i -
nally D F D w e r e
I m e a n t to h o o k
up with the then
u n k n o w n A Z ,
but as they
P flew over l o
the states A Z blew u p
with t h e massive 'Sugarhill' a n d they
w e r e k n o c k e d back. 21 Soldiers w e r e
from the s a m e place as A Z a n d they
s h a r e d t h e s a m e m a n a g e r , o n c e A Z
pulled out il w a s natural for 21 Soldiers
to step in.
T w o years b e t w e e n getting signed a n d
the a l b u m actually droppin', what's up
with that? "I've b e e n hard remixing a lot
of stuff, s o o n m y M a s c remixes are g o i n g
to droppin'. W e have b e e n putting out a
lot o f white label stuff a n d tried to build
u p a f o l l o w i n g o n t h e u n d e r g r o u n d
b e f o r e t h e a l b u m release." T h e D E D
n a m e is massive in t h e remix world, it all
started with a Gabrielle remix that Syzc-
Up did, s o m e o n e in t h e states heard it
and the next thing w a s a Lil Kim remix for
'Crush O n Y o u ' after this d r o p p e d the
p h o n e didn't stop. Syze-Up's L o n d o n
groove was/is in hot d e m a n d , he reworks
the entire tune c o m i n g back with s o m e
thing brand n e w . Busta p h o n e d u p for a
remix o n the 'Dangerous' single, "Yeah
w e f l i p p e d that o n e a n d u s e d s o m e
adlibs f r o m Busta to rework t h e tune".
Syze-Up s m o o t h e d it out and stuck Shari's
vocals o n the back to create a m u c h
m o r e funky d a n g e r o u s that w a s as infec-
tious as t h e first.
The Desert Eagle g u n is t h e most p o w -
erful h a n d g u n in the w o r l d a n d the
Desert Eagle Discs c o m e with that s a m e
forcefulness in their hard hitting sounds.
