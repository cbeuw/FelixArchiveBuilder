Imperial College Radio
Last term I C U Publications Board granted us sufficient money to
implement a link to Evelyn Gardens, specifically Mining and Bernard
Sunley Houses. This project has been on the 'back burner' for about
eighteen m o n t h s now, the delay being caused mainly by B r i t i s h
Telecom's tardiness in installing the required music-quality telephone
line. However, this installation has now taken place, and we are currently
in the process of constructing the required line amplifiers and isolation
equipment. Basically we pay for the electronics at our end, and the line
termination circuitry at the Evelyn Gardens end; the houses themselves
pay for the loudspeakers a n d l o u d s p e a k e r amplifiers. P r o j e c t e d
completion date is the end of this term (i.e. there's a lot of work still to
do).
The other main subject worthy of note at this time is that many people
still cannot pick up IC Radio. A problem certainly; an explanation follows.
Southside residents are theoretically able to tune in to the medium wave
transmitter on 301m ( 9 9 9 k H z ) . M a n y say they can't; it's hardly
surprising considering the number of power lines within the building and
the p r i m a r y building m a t e r i a l — f e r r o c o n c r e t e (not noted for its
transparency to radio frequencies). The best we can offer is to suggest
you site your radio close to the washbasin in your room where the signal
is usually stronger. Unfortunately home office regulations forbid us from
using, say, a 2k linear amplifier (like the one Hamsoc's got) and thus
reaching Hammersmith or other such areas. All the above also applies to
Linstead Hall, incidentally.
'All this is very spiffy,' you may well say (it's unlikely) 'but what about
programmes?' Well, this is where Y O U come in. W e are always looking
for D J s ; at the moment there are vacancies (lots) for people at weekends
and late at night weekdays (10:00-12:00pm). N o prior experience is
required—any numbskull can do it (!). Why not join us? Enquire at our
Southside Office (by the shop) any weekday lunchtime or in the evenings.
Also technical people are needed—preferably with some knowledge of
electronics.
SF Soc
Leechlike, the tall thin S F Bulletin
this week gives nothing away, but
instead taps the mental shoulder
of creative members of the society
in r e g a r d to the a p p r o a c h i n g
publication of the magazine some
call N M E 3 , an infamous fanzine
whose origins lie lost in the mists
of two years ago, a n d with a
bansheepish smile asks that all
people who wish their work to be
considered for its pages have very
little time left to give it to the
editor, be it fact, fiction, artwork
or whatever else their fevered
imaginations can invent. A n d you
thought they didn't write sen-
tences like that any more. Anyway,
if you can cabbie together prose
better than the above don't hide
your pen under a bushel, instead
rush your self-expression to Elise
Pechersley, Physics 3, and she will
give it whatever treatment occurs
to her. Y o u have until next Friday,
dog willing. So long, and remem-
ber only Batman can climb walls. If
you s h o u l d try i t — g o s h — h o l y
broken bones.

W e l l , you M U S T have settled
down into College life by now, so,
to all those people who showed
interest at Freshers' Fair, we've
now got several projects running.
C o m e forward, and show your-
selves. C o m e to our meetings at
12:30pm on Monday at the top of
the Union. Free coffee!

Ents
A n act of G o d prevented 'Overkill'
from playing here last term...was
he trying to tell us something?
F i n d out tonight in the lower
refectory—only £1 which includes
a bar, two bands and a hard rock
megasound system; which goes to
show that we cater for A L L tastes!
O n February 14....yes! T H A T
day! We hope to see you all in the
J C R for a rather special nocturnal
happening—"the IC/IF Valentines
Party". A superb jazz/funk band is
being arranged. Yes! you guessed
it—only £1 a ticket.
M o r e dates for your diary: Feb

attractions and, of course, every
Thursday evening in ME220 (next
to the list of Star Trek).
Liberal
Last week's Guildsheet writing
about the cut in student grants
claimed that "those who believe
that things will change under
another government, however,
will be in for a shock." Is there an
alternative to the present govern-
ment's disastrous higher education
policy? Find out by coming to hear
s h a d o w c a b i n e t m e m b e r a n d
opposition education spokesman,
Neil Kinnock M P on Tuesday,
February 2 in ME220 at 1:00pm.
The postponed meeting to elect
N O L S conference delegates and
submit amendments to conference
motions will be on T h u r s d a y ,
F e b r u a r y 4, at 1:00pm in the
U n i o n U p p e r L o u n g e . A s an
added incentive to attend we will
be discussing whether to challenge
the N O L S S t a n d i n g O r d e r s
Committee's decision that one of
our two conference motions was
invalid.
Socialist
Imperial College faces cuts in
expenditure of 20% in the next
three years which will impair the
quality of research and education.
Colleges of higher education and
polytechnics face cuts of up to
16% next year. In other areas,
parents now have to pay for the
e d u c a t i o n of t h e i r m e n t a l l y
handicapped children, thousands
of O A P s die of c o l d r e l a t e d
diseases, military spending in-
creases and new scapegoats are.
found (wreckers in industry, bad
teachers in education, blacks and
lefties in street riots); unemploy-
ment increases, things are bad
and getting worse.
If you are apolitical then you
don't care about the above, you
don't care about injustice, at least
not enough to get off your aTse
and do something. O u r student
l e a d e r s w i t h t h e i r p o p u l a r i t y
politics don't give a damn, and
when, probably at Easter, staff
redundancies are announced, the
student union will do nothing to
s u p p o r t the s t r i k i n g A S T M S
w o r k e r s , p e r h a p s o u r u n i o n
officers should be made redundant
in sympathy.
If you think we should be doing
something substantive to oppose
education cuts; if you think the
time has come for an end to the
union's apolitical stance and a firm
stand against moral injustice, then
c o m e to a m e e t i n g today at
1 : 0 0 p m in the U n i o n U p p e r
Lounge.
Snooker
After an e x t e n s i o n of holiday
festivities, we finally got around to
playing some matches last week.
The A team had a good away
victory at L S E , beating their A
team 4-1, while back home the B
and C teams were in devastating
form. T h e B team confidently
dealt with a three man outfit from
Bedford, just doing enough to win
5-0. It was drinks all round for the
jubilant C team when Holt came
from behind against his opponent
to force home a stunning victory
to out his side one up, as Paul was
in his usual generous mood which
he saves for snooker nights. The
merry-making continued until a 4-
1 victory was ensured, give or take
a few mis-haps along the way.
The open and handicap tourna-
ments are progressing nicely, and
have p r o d u c e d s o m e c l a s s i c
matches already. The infamous
Bricknell gave Tripp a scare in the
handicap, potting some balls with
shots that not many people would
have t h o u g h t of, b u t T r i p p ,
recovered in time to s q u e e z e
through 2-1. Calvert managed to
overcome a 28 point deficit against
Algy to win a match that everyone
was interested in. Jennings fluked
victory against an unlucky Batorijs
in the open, and that man Holt
continues to defy the odds by
marking in the same competition.
Keep watching the noticeboards
for more up-to-the-minute infor-
mation and results.
Wellsoc
We're back! Sorry we've been away for the past few Mondays, we've had
problems with lecturers cancelling at short notice. Anyhow that's behind
us and we're back with a vengence.
Lectures are organised for Monday evenings as usual. Highlights include
a professional magician from the Magic Circle, who will be talking about
the life of Houdini before doing his stage act. Popular demand sees the
return of the Wellsoc hypnotist this term.
•Films. A couple of excellent double bills are lined up. Freaks and
Polanski's Two Men in a Wardrobe are a really bizarre twosome. The
former has been described as the "weirdest thing ever to escape from
Holywood", and was banned in the U K for over thirty years. Also
Forbidden Planet and its sequel Invisible Boy.
Trips. A visit to the under world is being organised. That is to say, we've
arranged sittings with mediums for anyone who wants to find out about
the supernatural or get in touch with the undead. We've also received an
invitation from the National H . G . Wells Society to visit them in Bromley
and see places of historical interest and exhibitions related to H . G . Wells.
Drop your name and dept to me, Pallab Ghosh, in Physics U G letter-
racks or, better still, come along to Monday's lecture.
This Monday we're having a lecture on the 'Psychology of Gambling' by
Professor Bond, 7:30pm, Elec Eng 408. See you then.
