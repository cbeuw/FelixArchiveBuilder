Going it alone
On January 4 the Holland Club re-opened for the new term with
its own cook to run the catering service, after Mr Mooney decided
to close his outlet in the building.
Many students entering the Huxley Building from the JCR walkway will
have noticed the entrance to the Holland Club and may have wondered
what this organisation is all about.
The Holland Club was founded to provide social facilities, equivalent to
the Senior and Junior Common Rooms, for the non-teaching staff of the
College. It was based for many years in Princes Gardens and occupied a
house with its own catering and bar facilities.
When the house was needed for alternative purposes, the Club was left
without premises for many years until they were given the extension at
the back of the Huxley Building in October 1976. In these premises the
bar and catering facilities were run by Mr Mooney.
o
It soon became apparent to the committee of 13 that Mr Mooney was
treating the Holland Club badly. The food was often poor and they felt
that as they were providing social facilities (including snooker, pool,
darts, table tennis, etc.) and trying to attract new members, that the food
was a problem. Indeed, they wished to take it over themselves to improve
it.
The first move was to approach several outside caterers for an
estimate. Two offers seemed attractive and were about to be acted upon
when two major setbacks happened.
Firstly large cracks were found in the structure of the building along
with damp patches. As it then became uncertain how long the building
could be used safely, it was impossible to contact an outside caterer.
Then, shortly before Christmas 1981, Mr Mooney announced that he
would be discontinuing the Holland Club service after the end of the
autumn term. This left a bare six weeks to re-organise the catering
arrangements if the club wished to maintain the facility and operate it
from the start of 1982.
Their decision to employ a former chemisty technician, Mr Alfred
Coleman and his wife to run the kitchen. Mr Coleman had previously
been a cook (many years ago) and as a Holland Club member himself
was interested to help. To assist him, volunteers from the Committee
were enrolled to take money and do some of the cleaning.
So far the experiment seems to be a success. When I ate there on
Tuesday the service was impressive. Not only was the serving area
meticulously clean, but the food was hot, served on warm plates and
most enjoyable. The standard of food is certainly equivalent and probably
better than Mr Mooney at his best. There is a mixture of frozen and
freshly prepared dishes which, if maintained and improved, could mean
that the non-teaching staff will have established in three weeks what Mr
Mooney failed to do in five years; provide a catering facility with food of
an acceptable standard which is profitable.
The Holland Club is only open to the members (about 900 of them) and
their guests. So if you know a friendly technician, secretary or other non-
teaching staff member, it might be worthwhile asking them to take you
along.
