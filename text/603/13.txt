CONTACT WEEK '82
The West London Chaplaincy operates primarily through a number of
small groups in Imperial College, the Royal College of Music and
Queen Elizabeth Col.ege. In Imperial College there is a Chaplaincy
group which meets regularly each week (usually over a meal) in most
departments and halls of residence.
During Contact Week a team of people whose photographs you see
below are coming to the colleges as guests of the Chaplaincy groups
which meet there. They will be living in halls of residence and working
with the groups that meet there and in the various departments. The
aim of the week is to deepen the life of the Chaplaincy groups, to invite
others to become involved in the groups and to encourage wider
discussion and debate within the halls and departments. A number of
informal discussions involving the Contact Week team members will be
taking place throughout the week in most halls and departments in
Imperial College and in the other two colleges. There will also be a
number of events arranged on a College-wide basis (see programme).
Peter Crick is acting as co-
ordinator for the team at their
morning sessions during Contact
Week. He has been on Contact
Week before in 1979. He is Rector
of Denham, a large parish on the
edge of London going towards
Oxford.
