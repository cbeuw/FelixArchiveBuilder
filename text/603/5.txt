T h i s article will attempt to wake up those
of you who are half asleep. For those of
y o u whose eyelid has flickered slightly
hoping this is a happy alternative to a
Friday morning boring lecture I hasten to
say that this i s not what I mean by "half
asleep", though you will notice when
reading this article that the chances are
you are included somewhere in it.
My starting point is the recent lecture given
by the D e p u t y S e c r e t a r y G e n e r a l of the
Commonwealth M r E . C . Anyaoku entitled
" N e w N a t i o n s : M a k i n g I n d e p e n d e n c e a
Reality" (for a summary and comments on
which you will have to wait for the next
FELIX). What struck me is that there were
about forty people in the audience. Now forty
people do not make an unsuccessful lecture,
though they do not either make a successful
one. When coming to this College some years
ago I was aware that scientists are a very dull
lot, but a glance through the activities of the IC
student population gave me some hope. I saw
among other things a Communist society,
Socialist society, Labour club, Conservative
society, O v e r s e a s S t u d e n t s committee , a
Christian society, Islamic society, IC Women's
association, and so on. I also saw a president
of IC Union being the president of N U S and a
F E L I X Editor being an Editor of Sennet (now
called L o n d o n Student). I further saw a
College committee on overseas students, a
Delhi committee, and even a counselor for
overseas students. In my time a department of
humanities evolved to interrelate scientific and
philosophical thought. I then went on to see
that there was a wine tasting society, a real ale
society, an astrological society, a W e l l s
society, a stamp club, atheltics and national
clubs, a radio club, a students television and
even a students newspaper in which every
member of College could voice his opinion. I
must confess I was pleased. It seemed that IC
was not producing cold blinkered scientists of
outstanding merit. It was actually producing
scientists of oustanding merit with a balanced
opinion all the advantages and disadvantages
of their scientific work and aware of most of
the positive and negative social consequences
of it. One thing that gave me further hope was
the inclusion in every engineering course of
what was termed "associated studies". At the
time, you see, I was not aware they were
compulsory nor did I realise they needed to
be compulsory.
Slowly but steadily my opinion reverted to
one I had before coming to IC. I am now
convinced that IC is so apathetic that IC
graduates are in the long run a threat to
society. It troubles me to think that the
majority is not in fact d i s o r i e n t a t e d , but
unorientated.
But let me return to the lecture I mentioned
above. It will be seen from the title of the talk
that both Mrs S. Williams M P and M r E. Heath
M P have given lectures on the same topic. For
those of you who are not even aware of these
lectures I am referring to topics steming from
the Brandt Report with which both speakers
have dealt with. For those of you who are not

aware of either the Brandt Report nor the
Alternative Brandt. I confess you have reached
too far in this article—please go back to sleep.
When these two distinguished guests delivered
their lectures they did so in "standing room"
conditions. When their lectures ended they
were vigorously applauded. I had to presume
that their message had got through. Alas, this
was not the case. Some of you may remember
that their message was one of alarm and need
of understanding and co-operation between all
m o d e r n nations. The absence of a large
audience in the Deputy Secretary's lecture
showed that this message had not got through.
We had with us a very distinguished guest who
had honoured us in agreeing to give a lecture
which would further our understanding of the
developing world and the ideas we have about
it. Where was M r Heath's and Mrs Williams'
audience then? Where were the at least 1,000
s t u d e n t s w h o a c t u a l l y c o m e f r o m the
Commonwealth? Where were the Communist
Society members who pledge awareness about
the world? Where were the Labour Society
members who pledge solidarity to every
thinkable and unthinkable cause? Where were
the Conservative Society members—wet or
dry—whose forefathers created the Common-
wealth? W h e r e were the religious society
members who are so touched after disaster
has stricken some unfortunate country?
1 personally cannot answer these questions.
What I can see though is that M r Heath's and
Mrs Williams' audience did not attend their
lectures to listen to what they had to say. They
were simply there to admire sheepishly two of
their leaders. They will also be there to attack
them, somewhere in the flock, if and when
they make what they wiill have been led, rightly
or wrongly, to think of as a mistake.
You may be aware that Imperial College was
originally created to produce scientists and
engineers of international calibre whose
ultimate purpose was to spread into the British
Empire and industrialise every remote corner
of the globe. The general idea seems to have
been one in which Britain was naturally on
top in the development of the world with
obvious financial, cultural and political benefit
to everyone concerned. The ideal seems also
to have been similar. Britain would be carrying.
the torch of knowledge throughout the world,
thus making it certain that history would
honourably judge her. Unfortunately recent
political ideas as well as uncountable occasions
of the action being different from the thought
have sunk both the idea and the ideal.
Nevertheless. Imperial College has suffered
the least from all this. It still maintains a high
proportion of overseas students and still has
m e m b e r s f r o m v a r i o u s c o m m o n w e a l t h
countries in its body of governors. What is
now happening at IC seems to be melting away
the last chance for both Britain to prevail and
the ideal of world co-operation (and hence
success) to stay alive. In one world the answer
is apathy (which I see from F E L I X 602 was
pointed out by the then F E L I X Editor fourteen
years ago!). What makes this word even more
alarming is that it crops up in an exclusively
technological college of high standard while we
are living in a technological age!
But don't alarm yourselves (your lecture
hour is still going and your lecturer, however
competent, cannot be more interesting than
the a p p r o a c h i n g weekend). O t h e r s have
suffered the same fate in history. The Greek
civilisation, the Roman Empire and the Arab
world all collapsed due to this magic word.
There seems no reason why the British Empire
would be able to maintain its peak, even
though students of history have repeatedly
developed sore throats shouting out their
findings. Unfortunately for them and you they
were not scientists so they did not apply
"scientific rigour" in their arguments. It was
just feelings and their predictions were wrong
by time factors of up to centuries! I a m
informed they are now trying harder to achieve
more "scientifc" accuracy for it is this, and
only this, which scientists appreciate and
understand. Otherwise, it is their fate to ask
unanswerable questions and thus "torture"
themselves. Scientists do not tend to ask such
questions and so proceed to a quieter life
which does not involve any inner passion. I
envy you for your inability to ask yourselves
questions about " i d e a l s " , " p u r p o s e " , a n d
"ambition", for you lead, in this way, simple
lives with no questions to burn you inside out. I
also pity you for the same reason for your
problems become petty and out of context,
I would like to end this outburst with a
statistic you may understand. A human being
sleeps approximately 2700 hours per year.
Sacrificing one hour to further your knowledge
about the world constitutes a sacrifice of
0 . 0 0 0 4 % , a l l c a l c u l a t i o n s b e i n g w i t h i n
engineering accuracy.
