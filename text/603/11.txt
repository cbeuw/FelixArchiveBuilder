§ Rugby
Thirds
In this first match of 1982 nine players made
their debute for the Thirds. F r o m the w a r m -
up a strong team spirit was established and
was evident throughout the match, easily
making up for the disadvantage of being a
player short—he was ref-ing. F r o m the kick-
off it was clear that the smaller, lighter I C
pack of only seven men was going to have a
h a r d j o b w i n n i n g clear possession a n d
defending against a large U C L team. T w o
superb tries, involving much passing gave I C
a half-time lead of 15-6, having conceeded
two penalties.
Throughout the second half the superior
weight and numbers of U C L forwards began
to take effect. IC won very little possession
and spent much of the time defending hard.
Despite this, a fine try was run from within
our own 22 involving the entire team in a
brilliant display of passing and support for a
touch down under the posts. I C conceeded
two tries in the dying minutes of the match.
A fine team performance throughout a fast
c l e a n e x h a u s t i n g g a m e was t o p p e d by
pinpoint goal kicking by M . Hudson.
Team: J. Cougton, C. Dobson, M. Hudson (1
try, 4 conversions, 1 penally), M. Patterson. C.
Boyd-Moss, P. Hughes-.Narborough (1 try), J.
Taylor, A. Marks, M. Shepherd, E. Handford, J.
Poullney, J. Mulligan (2 tries), P. Overs, J.
.Vorley, S. Kirby.

Firsts
This time the match venue was warm, dry
and had lots of refreshments (Jaffa cakes!).
F l o w e v e r , the o p p o s i t i o n was not m u c h
changed from the last meeting though their
pairing had changed and we, without our
two England Y o u t h stars, still produced a
handsome 8-1 victory. W i n g and Ball had a
difficult time with their first pair but won in
three sets. However, there was no trouble
f r o m t h e i r first p a i r a g a i n s t L e e a n d
Adamson who squashed them 15-0, 15-10.
Unfortunately, our third pair were beaten by
their first pair.
Overall, it looks as if we are well on our
way to winning the mens F'irst Division for
the second time in four years! (F'ull athletic
colours for all the first team!)
Team: H.K. Wing, I. Ball, T. Lae, G.
Adamson. S. Chiany and L. Tup.
^ Hockey
Firsts
This was our first game for a couple of
months because of the weather. (It's been
snowing a bit!!) So, despite a distinct lack of
match practice and fitness, added to an
appalling pitch, I C played a surprisingly
reasonable game of hockey. Ashford's pre-
match over-confidence due to their superior
league position was soon thwarted by a good
team display by I C .
Ashlord's goal came in the first hall after J .
Clarke, whilst in possession of the ball, tried
to be too casual when confronted with about
half the opposition. F r o m this slight set-back,
I C increased their pleasure but had to wait
until mid-way through the second half for A .
Garms to score a well-deserved goal after a
dazzling solo run.
Garms scored a winner with only a few
minutes to spare, but their umpire disallowed
the goal because he was biased.
Although we weren't playing at H a r l i n g -
ton, our goalkeeper, R. Slatter, was still able
to keep himself amused, in between his usual
display of aerobatics, by watching trains and
the odd jet.
In the changing rooms, his only comment
on the match was: " I couldn't quite read the
lettering on the Lufthansa 727 that flew
past."
A l l the team played well, etc., etc.
T e a m : Slatter, Clarke (Capt), Parker (match
report writer), Franklin, Riley, Bell, Ayers, Rao,
Farmer, Garms, Bateson.
Seconds
Remembering last term's league match in
which the quality of umpiring decisions was
matched only by the total lack of sportsman-
ship in the Ashford team, we approached this
game with some relish. Ashford, obviously
delighted with the prospect of their umpire
running the whole game, allowed us to play
with eleven men, a move they regretted from
the start. Inside the first five minutes Mangat
Bansal and A n d y Stroomer combined down
the right, a bye-line cross providing the first
goal from Mangat. After two similar attacks
we went two-nil ahead, T i m Mitchell doing
his best to miss from close range but finally-
forcing the ball home. Just before half-time
an incident occured which would bring tears
to the eyes of any cricketer who has ever
forgotten his box! Fortunately, the victim
was an Ashford player, although sympathetic
winces would be seen on both sides!
In the second half, down to ten men and
tiring we had to cope with strong Ashford pres-
sure. The defence was bolstered by Jeremy
Rhodes in his comeback game after five
years away from the sport. Needless to say, he
looked perfectly at home in the team and
together with Pete C u n n i n g h a m and Roger
Roessink held out until late in the game when
Ashford scored twice to force a draw. F a r be
it from me to allocate any responsibility but it
was really all Simon Gray's fault for hitting
(he post in the first half!
T e a m : Butter, Roessink, Cunningham,
Whitehead, Rhodes, Gray, Pitkethly, Stroomer,
Bansal, Wylie, Mitchell.
Thirds
Ashford were a very friendly bunch, except
for the big C F with the pathetic beard and
Tony who kept coughing to put off Pete
(watch his eyes) Sharpe. C r a i g and M a r t i n
sported post-Xmas bum-fluff—even Garms
has more hair and Chris Jones played a
scorcher and deserves man of the year award.
Ed started his captaincy with a goal (why so
many c ivil engineers with power in H C ? ) .
The ladies asked me to include this note
about their match:
O n Saturday we played hockey. F'irst we
got on the coach, then we played, then
M a i n l y scored a goal! T h e n we got changed.
.Next we had tea, then we went home.
T e a m : Jones, Sharpe, Cattell, Witter, Shindler,
tavlor, Allen, Benham, McGuire (Capt).

Sevenths
Frank Bogey-Rolla is the man to blame for
the c u r r e n t rash of u n o r t h o d o x m a t c h
reports.
U p until now the Glanville-like insight.*
into the tactical ploys adopted by opposition
(ie shouting offside every time the ball enters
the St Thomas' half) was enough to satisfy
the reader. However, now they want to be
entertained.
Consequently I will just say T o m Donovan
and guest striker A n t o n scored.
People in the know reckon this was the
second best sporting performance of the year
so far. The 20-12 defeat of Wales being the
maiiihy-
W i t h the recent thaw I C were able to sail
their first match of the term against City
University at Queen M a r y Reservoir. The
first race started badly but a team effort
brought I C up to 2, 3, 4 only to lose due to a
collision on the finishing line. In the second
race Mills sailed two City boats around the
wrongside of the start mark and then showed
a clean pair of heels, I C winning 1, 2, 4.
Kennedy and M i l l s repelled all attackers
w i t h close m a r k i n g in the t h i r d to let
Bennett and Dalton skillfully slip through
into a comfortable second place to give I C a
2, 3, 4 win and the match.
T e a m : Bennett, Bullet, Dalton, Kennedy,
Mills, Tounghusband.
Bowling
The bowling team suffered a disappointing
home defeat at the hands of league leaders
Brunei University last Saturday.
T h e r e w e r e a n u m b e r of e x c e l l e n t
individual performances for I C , including
personal high scores for N e i l G r i m w o o d
A n d y Davis, K e v i n Short and M a r k Stanley,
high games by K e v i n S h o r t (191), N e i l
G r i m wood (174) and M a r k Stanley with a
magnificent 202, the best ever score by an I C
C team player, and good games from A n d y
M c M u l l a n '(221) and Bobby T h o n g (190),
but the strength in depth of the Brunei team
proved too m u c h for the I C bowlers.
The A , B & C teams all managed to take
oAe game from their opponents, the C teams
victory in the third game being the first
inflicted on Brunei C this season, but this was
not enough to give IC any league points and
this s e r i o u s l y h a m p e r s o u r c h a n c e s of
qualifying for the quarter-final stages of the
U C T B A tournament.
A T e a m : Ray Cook, Martin Harrison, W'ai
Cheong Man, Andy McMullan, Jimmy Tang.
B team: Andy Davis, Dick Hooper, Kevin
Short, Bob Thong, Chris Wells.
C team: Neil Grimwood, Jeffrey Quinn, Dave
Smith, Martin Smith, Mark Stanley.
Ladies team: Marie Cheong, Sue Hills, Seli
Kazemian, Flaine Scott, Alison Walker.
Next game is away to Portsmouth Poly on
Sunday, with our final southern zone match
at Southampton taking place next Wednes-
day.
