All My Sons by Arthur Miller, directed by
Michael Blakemore, Wyndhams Theatre.
Arthur Miller, the contemporary American
playwright, is best known for his plays Death
of a Salesman and The Crucible. All My Sons
was his first successful play which immediately
established him as a dramatist of international
stature.
The play's theme, a d i s t u r b i n g but not
altogether surprising one, was conceived in
wartime when voices were publicly declaring
that all human endeavour was united and of
one purpose: the defeat of the enemy. But
Miller sensed that little had changed in reality.
There were some who were working towards
their own ends. In Miller's words, the play "was
an unveiling of what I believed everybody knew
and nobody publicly said."
The backyard of the Keller's house in the
Mid-West in the late 1940s sets the scene of
the play. The war is over, business is booming
and wedding plans are nearing completion. But
an o d d wartime incident c o n c e r n i n g the
father's business in supplying engine parts for
fighter p l a n e s is c r u e l l y r e s u r r e c t e d . A
consignment of faulty products caused the
crash of a squadron, and it is with the shock
crash of squadron, and it is with shock that we
gradually realise that the father knowlingly
allowed the parts to be dispatched in order
that his business could continue. This past
event has astonishing repercussions as the
play unfolds. Suspense and tension increase
throughout the drama and these continue in a
masterly way with startling and unnerving
revelations. The characters are most movingly
and convincingly portrayed by a strong cast,
headed by Colin Blakely and Rosemary Harris.

The Second Mrs Tanqueray by Arthur
Wing Pinero. Directed by Michael
Rudman, The Lyttelton, National Theatre.
Felicity Kendal and Leigh Lawson star as the
ill-matched newly-weds in the play, The
Second Mrs Tanqueray by the late Victorian
dramatist, Arthur Pinero. To the incredulity of
his friends Aubrey Tanqueray takes as his
s e c o n d wife one of those w o m e n with a
' d o u b t f u l ' pas t so b e l o v e d of V i c t o r i a n
dramatists and upon whom they could satisfy
their audiences' vast hunger and thirst for
moral retribution. The couple are exiled by
fashionable London society to deepest Surrey
where M r s Tanqueray quickly becomes bored.
She also becomes jealous of her husband's
fondness for his daughter by his first marriage
and things get even worse when he tries to
protect his convent-educated offspring from
his wife's " l i g h t , c a r e l e s s n a t u r e " . T h e
prickliness of the situation draws blood when
the daughter falls in love with an old flame of
her mother's. This last scene reaches heights
of drama and human unpleasantness of an
intensity a n d agitation that I have rarely
experienced at a play.
The play today is still capable of horrifying
its audience with its reference to men whose
sexual lives are as bad as those of the fallen
women on whom they prey. The point Pinero
is making is that the man often gets off lightly
while the woman is treated as a promiscuous
and venomous parasite. The first two acts of
the play are rather dull and slow-moving but
the r i v e t i n g a n d h o r r i f y i n g final act is
successful in remedying this.

Pass the Butler, written by Eric Idle,
directed by Jonathan Lynn, the Globe
Theatre, Shaftesbury Ave.
Lric Idle's first stage play opened at the Globe
Shaftesbury Avenue on Tuesday. It seemed at
first to be another one of those English farces
like 'No Sex Please-Tve caught it in the
Mousetrap' shows appealing only to grannies,
the rent man and accountants, but how wrong
I was. If you know that you are first in line for
her will then don't take Auntie to see it, and
don't go yourself if you've had a few glasses of
"Louis san Wogga-wogga" because you'll need
all of your brain cells to appreciate this one (a
bit like the Orestia and O T T ) .
We are introduced to the family of Lord
C h a r l e s ( d e c e a s e d - t o - b e ) C o n s e r v a t i v e
Secretary of State for Defence, unfortunately
Lord Charles lies in an aluminised. computer-
controlled, coffin-like casket upstage and has
about as much action left in him as an episode
from Crossroads. Most of the family appears
to spend the morning playing a game which
involves counting the day's death-toll in each
of their newspapers the winner being the one
to have found the greatest number (the bad
taste d e p r e c i a t e s f r o m h e r e o n in). T h e
highlight of the s h e r r y , followed by the
termination of Lord Charles by a ceremonial
switch-off (Described as, "...electrocution in
reverse") then sherry to follow. The normality
"fetch the men in the white coats" borderline
begins to get very thin from now on and in the
words of Lady Charles' Buddhist-vegetarian-
Oxford U n i son Nigel we become "...even
uncertain about Heisenberg's U n c e r t a i n t y
Principle..."
We are then confronted by the press, played
by Peter Jones (of Hitchikers Guide to the
Galaxy fame), a Conservative back-bencher
( J o h n S a u n d e r s ) , the m a n d a t o r y P o l i c e
, Inspector played by Terence Bayler (Leggy
Mountbatten in another of Idle's creations,
The Ruttles) a n d the o d d M a l a p r o p i a n
mutterings of Beryl Cooke as Kitty.
The second half of the play (rivalled only I
think by the N T ' s On the Razzle) led me into
c y c l e s of b e l l y - a c h i n g l a u g h t e r w h e n I
discovered that all was not as it seemed. We
discover that due to an item in a glass jar on a
shelf in North Africa, Lady Charles (played by
Madge Ryan) is not the Lady Charles that she
at first appears to be, that her twins Hugo and
Anabelle are 39 and 28 years old respectively,
that someone in the house has been leaking
military secrets to the Soviets and two Scottish
paranoids twise the tumblers and unlock a box
full of intrigue that even Pandora could have
resisted.
The cast is superbly suited to the maniacal
humour of Idle, with John Fortune as Butler
(the butler) and Willy Rushton's upper-twit
Hugo blending well into the flow. The action in
the first half did appear a little disjointed, and
some of the timing of the second act needs to
be polished up a little but no doubt when the
cast has settled in to their new surroundings
(the play is a transferral from its success in
Cambridge) Peter Jones' karate routine and
John Saunders' rather mechanistic dialogue
will improve the general flow....but remember
Auntie's will and tuck her up in bed before yuu
leave for the show!

Aida by Giuseppe Verdi, English National
Opera at the London Coliseum.
Aida is the "grandest of the grand operas" and
usually requires management with grand
determination (and grand amounts of money)
to stage. However. English National Opera
with its avowed aim of tackling operas which
are said to be impossible to stage has achieve
remarkable success with this production.
Verdi's favourite theme, the triangle conflict,
between the C h u r c h , the State a n d the
Individual, finds expression in Egypt's glorious
past- the ancient Egypt of the Pharaohs.
Radan'ies. chosen by the god Isis to lead the
E g y p t i a n a r m i e s into battle against the
invading Ethiopians, has fallen for Aida, an
enemy slave in the Royal Household who,
unknown to him, is daughter of the Ethiopian
King. Although it may be felt that the plot lacks
credibility (even though many of the details are
in fact historically accurate) the immense
appeal enjoyed by this great work of Verdi lies
in its rousing music and visual splendour. The.
music is often t r e m e n d o u s l y m o v i n g a n d
stirring, especially in the G r a n d March. In life
Verdi earned the nickname 'papa dei cori',
f a t h e r of the c h o r u s e s , w h i c h r e g u l a r l y
inflamed the patriotism of Italian audiences.
The grandeur of ancient Egypt is spectacularly
captured in the stage designs and especially in
â€¢the c o s t u m e s of the priests, priestesses,
m i n i s t e r s , o f f i c e r s , g u a r d s , c o u r t i e r s ,
populace, slaves and prisoners, who swell
E N O ' s huge stage. G i a n t heads of gods,
expansive facades of hieroglyphs, off-stage
choruses, dancers and herald trumpeters add
to an incomparable visual and musical feast to
be found on no other London stage.
(Further performances are on February 4, 9
and 12. Standby tickets are available.)
