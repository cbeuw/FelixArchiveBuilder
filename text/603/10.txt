Volleyball
F o l l o w i n g t h e i r c o n v i n c i n g w i n against
Harrow the previous week I C met Hatfield
Polytechnic last Wednesday looking for a win
to maintain their position at the top of the
league. A bit of extra spice was added to the
match due to the fact that through a lot of
"back-stabbing" and rule bending and with
the help of a stubborn organiser Hatfield had
had Imperial eliminated from the K O C u p ,
thereby ruining their chances of doing the
double. Imperial, however, gained sweet
revenge, absolutely dominating the match
from the first serve and never once looking
like losing. The set scores were an impressive
15-3, 15-5, 15-2. In all it was a good team
performance, possibly their best of the season
from a determined I C side, which made
Hatfield look far worse than they actually
were.
Team: Peter W., Andy, Peter R., Man, Peter
D-L, Xada, Paul, Chris (referee), Renia and
Francois (scorers). J
Rugby

T h e match was played in a cold damp gym
with no changing rooms and no refreshments.
T h e o p p o s i t i o n w a s n o t p a r t i c u l a r l y
formidable even though some of their team
played for U L U . O f the games in the match
there is little to say except tha^we thrashed
them every time with very little sweat lost.
O u r team was one of the strongest this
season with S. Willis, O Hulllet, H . K . Wong,
I. Bull, T . L a i and G . Adamson.
