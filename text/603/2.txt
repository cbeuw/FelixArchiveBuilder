Dear Mark
So we have a m o n g our
number in this college, people
who subscribe to the creation-
ist view. T h e t h i n g w h i c h
struck me forcibly about both
attacks on my article from M r
j M e r c e r a n d the I s l a m i c
S o c i e t y was t h e i r l a c k of
precision. Apart from saying
or i m p l y i n g that they are
against my views, or what
they took to be my views, they
were not very clear about
their thoughts on the subject.
M r Mercer took a distinctly
selective and dubious inter-
pretation of Genesis I. I have,
of course, pondered on the
order of creation given in Gen
I: 1-26 being the same as that
determined by evolutionary
theory; however I have also
pondered on G e n II: 4-24
• which deals with the same
material but gives a different
order.
A n d quite how the Islamic
Society can say that 1400
years ago the basis of modern
science was revealed leaves
me (almost) speechless. If this
had been the case then surely
there would have been no
need to have spent the vast
effort on the Scientific Enter-
prise that has been exerted.
M u c h as it is nice to say that
you were right with hindsight,
although the interpretations
of the K o r a n verses quoted
did seem slightly far-fetched
to me, it is simply ancestor
worship to claim this. That is
in some way our ancestors
were better, or knew more,
than we are or do.
Both M r Mercer and the
Islamic Society state some of
the t h i n g s t h a t they are
against, but omit a great deal
and fail to say what they are
for. For example does M r
Mercer think that man is an
animal or not? Do M r Mercer
a n d t h e I s l a m i c S o c i e t y
c o n s i d e r a m a t e r i a l i s t i c
account of evolution is suffici-
ent or do they want to add to
it, propose another explana-
tion, or not believe in the idea
of evolution at all? Neither
said a n y t h i n g about what
they thought about creation-
ism. What sort of people are
these who attack a coherent
explanation of the develop-
ment of life and yet have
nothing to say about what
they think of the problem.
U n l i k e w h a t M r M e r c e r
thinks I have no desire to
forcibly suppress creationism,
since the very inarticulateness
of people like him is sufficient
to c o n d e m n i t ; I m e r e l y
reserve the right to point out
what these people are saying.
M r Mercer also said that I
had accused creationists of
' m e g l o m a n i a ' (a word i n -
cidentally that I did not use;
do I detect a trace of para-
noia?). H e did not refute my
charge that creationists were
seeking to impose a belief
system on society so that they
could control society. This is
o b v i o u s l y M r M e r c e r e n -
deavouring to suppress the
truth about the motives of the
creationists, which is quite
apparent to anyone who has
had the misfortune to read
any of their literature.
Finally M r Mercer stated
that Darwin was a Christian.
In his youth he was, but after
the publication of his Origin of
Species in 1859 he was hounded
from the church by people as
i n t o l e r a n t as M r M e r c e r
appears to be today. Truth is
more important than dogma,
a lesson which M r Mercer
and the Islamic Society have
yet to learn.
Tours sincerely

Dear Sir
I read w i t h interest the
article that you published in
the F E L I X supplement last
week by the Islamic Society
and would be grateful if they
would return the complement
by reading this letter.
I am a Christian and would
also like to think of myself as a
scientist. I took biochemistry
as a first degree and found
that, far from conflicting with
my religious beliefs, it i n -
creased my awareness of the
marvellous intricacies and
complexities of life to such an
extent that I find it hard to
understand those who do not
believe in a creator. These
beliefs can only be reinforced
when one considers the vast-
ness of the observable universe
when compared to the insigni-
ficant, though all important
to us, speck of dust that is the
earth.
I am an ardent believer in
Darwinism and do not find it
conflicts at all with my belief
in God. It is impossible to
demonstrate the existance of
God by a scientific method. A
quick look in Genesis 2 (where
the creation is given i n a
different order to the famous
story in Genesis 1) quickly
dispels the argument that the
B i b l e is right because the
c r e a t i o n story follows the
order of biological evolution.
It must be understood that
whether or not this is the case
is completely irrelevant to
true religion and only serves
to draw attention away from
the true focus—God himself.
Similarly I would be most
surprised if a truly devout
M u s l i m found it necessary to
m a n i p u l a t e the sayings of
M u h a m e d to try to demon-
strate his awareness of modern
scientific discoveries.
In conclusion I would like
to say that true science whose
ideal is pursuit of the truth
can only serve to increase
man's awareness of his G o d
and his incredible feebleness
and insignficance in the face
of the vastness and variety of
that which we know as crea-
tion.

The College members of
the 22 C l u b regret that M r
S.J. Marshall finds it necessary
to put his name to a badly
written collection of lies and
m i s i n f o r m e d o p i n i o n , as
a p p e a r e d i n the s o a p b o x
article in F E L I X 602. The
reason for our regret is not
that we hold M r Marshall in
any esteem whatsoever, but
that he is an associate of the
Royal College of Science, a
title proudly borne by the
majority of our members. We
do not wish to correct the
lacts here nor to continue
this debate through the pages
of F E L I X . We will simply
state that any member of the
College wishing to know the
truth about our behaviour or
the spirit of our club has only
to ask a club member.
We remain your obedient servants

Dear Sir
A n opportunity is arising to
ship many tonnes of medical,
f o o d , a n d o t h e r essential
supplies by boat and land
from I C to Poland. Estimated
date of departure is M a r c h 21
with Easter spent in Poland or
Czechoslovakia.
For this private and totally
charitable venture to succeed
we need a reliable conscien-
tious a n d n o n - p o l i t i c a l I C
crew to: organise supplies;
crew the vehicles; assist in
distribution; return without
p o l i t i c a l or m e d i a p r o p a -
ganda.
T h e cargo w i l l be fully
m a n i f e s t e d , a n d the c r e w
must have v a l i d visas i n
British passports. We hope the
trip will be fun, but there will
be some speedy hard graft at
times. Since the reception will
be mixed we hope to take a
mixed crew.
If you can offer any help
please contact Colin Cooper
in DoC2.
