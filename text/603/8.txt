PS: It's all free!
UN Soc
At last, the society you've all been
waiting for: U N Soc is back with a
vengence. This term we have a
host of provocative and contro-
versial films and talks lined up. We
are starting off next Thursday
lunchtime with a film about drug
abuse (which makes Christiane F
look tame!), this will be followed
by an informal discussion with free
(!) coffee and biscuits. Be there!
Amnesty
The Amnesty International Group
will be collecting donations around
C o l l e g e n e x t T h u r s d a y . T h e
m o n e y raised will go towards
paying off a large debt we owe our
B r i t i s h S e c t i o n , a n d t o w a r d s
furthering our work.
Currently, the group is trying to
free Firmin Awadon, a student in
jail in Benin in Africa. Despite the
l a r g e l e t t e r - w r i t i n g effort in
November and letters since, Col.
Mathieu Kerekou's government
remains silent. Whilst in Paris, one
of our members visited the Benin
E m b a s s y t h e r e a n d met the
Charge d'Affaires. This dignified .
official asked whether our mem-
bers knew anyone in England who
would' be willing to let him stay
with them so that he could learn
English—in exchange, he offered
two weeks in France, saying he'd
do the c o o k i n g . ( N o k i d d i n g ,
folks'!)
Seriously, our adopted prisoner
n e e d s s u p p o r t . H e has been
imprisoned for two years with no
charges preferred against him.
Please give a little change to our
collection.
& Guilds
There was no Guilds article last
week, not because I forgot to write
o n e , but to m a k e y o u m o r e
appreciative of the ones I remem-
ber to write! This week there's a
U G M on Thursday at 1:00pm in
M e c h Eng, so come and see Julian
do his marmalade impersonation,
and on Friday there's a theatre
trip to see Amadeus, it's a really
great play so don't miss it, tickets
£3 from the Guilds Office.
Tickets to D & D are going fast,
so if you want to go, hurry up and
get yours! Finally, if you're into
rugby or soccer and want to play
in your year dept team, see your
social reps, or Slug or Dave in the
U n i o n O f f i c e . H e r e ' s h o p i n g
t h e r e ' l l be an a r t i c l e in n e x t
week's F E L I X .

Saturday, February 13, so if you
want a more representative union,
please consider standing for a
post. Y o u don't have to be a hack,
perhaps it would be better if none
of the officers were, you just have
to c a r e a b o u t what R C S U is
doing. Feel free to ask any officer
about any job.
Finally, the soccer sixes are
being held on Sunday, February
14, so how about getting a team
together from your year.

At the moment Charles Fuller
and myself are investigating the
possibility of having the annual
dinner which is on M a r c h 19, out
of College. The cost will, we hope,
be under £10, and you will be able
to choose whether or not you
require wine. W e think that this
will give you the best possible
event, although s o m e officers
disagree, but we will welcome any
ideas.
R C S U elections are coming up
soon now. The papers go up on
Just a quick note to tell everyone
a b o u t n e x t m o n t h ' s e v e n t s
( n o t h i n g really h a p p e n e d this
m o n t h — e x c e p t the C a k e auc-
t i o n e d at the M i n e s B a l l was
presented to the Chelsea Pen-
sioners at the Stanford Bridge
Arms, and that Jez has lots of new
sweatshirts in, for you to buy at
only £5.50 each!).

Rebates Audio
Any undergraduates who applied
for a rent and rate rebate before
Christmas should consider con-
tacting their housing department
again if they d i d not r e c e i v e
supplementary benefit, unemploy-
m e n t b e n e f i t o r a n y e a r n e d
i n c o m e for part or all of the
holiday period.
Most local authority housing
departments are assessing student
applications on the basis of their
termly income (approx £53pw)
w i t h o u t a u t o m a t i c a l l y m a k i n g
adjustments for the three week
period when the vacation element
of the grant is £21.15pw. While
many students applying for these
r e b a t e s m a y h a v e b e e n d i s -
a p p o i n t e d by the low level of
benefit, or even complete lack of it
during termtime, many will find
that they do quality for a reason-
able amount during vacation. The
sums involved appear to vary
considerably between different
boroughs, but as yet we do not
have enough information to quote
any figues. Questionnaires have
been distributed to students in the
head tenancies in an attempt to
monitor the situation and it would
also be useful to hear from anyone
in private sector accommodation
who has applied, successfully or
otherwise.

Ulterior motives aside, I would
love it (as I know you would too) if
I could tell you that you would
really enjoy yourselves if you were
to c o m e to t h i s A u d i o S o c
meeting. Let me enthuse further.
Mike Daniels is a great guy; he,
just like Stretch Armstrong, is
anything that you want him to be,
but most of all he is a young sales
manager of D . W . Labs. "What the
hell are D . W . Labs?" I hear you
asking.
Have you not heard of Gale
Loudspeakers? Haven't you heard
of the Carver Cube Amplifier?
Well, D . W . Labs are the marvel-
lous group of people who dis-
tribute the two "legends in their
lifetime" products.
M r Daniels will try to explain the
principles involved in dealing with
the hi-fi press and other things
along those lines. He will also be
demonstrating the Carver Cube
and Gale Loudspeakers to their
limits.
So remember, rather than let
sleeping dogs lie, kick them in
their bellies and come along to this
lecture which is to be held in the
Quiet Room, QR002, Sherfield
Building on Wednesday, February
3, at 6:30pm.
A l s o note that on M o n d a y ,
February 15, same time, same
place, same channel, Max Town-
shend, Managing Director of Elite
Electronics will be coming along to
give us a lecture. So live it up.
Industrial Society
This is it! It's the big one!! Today
at 12:50pm, Ian Ross will take a
break from charting the fortunes
of A S L E F , B L and the like to tell,
us about his experiences as B B C
Industrial Correspondent and his
picture of industry. All welcome in
C h e m Eng LT1 at 12:50pm.
After this, our next event is a
visit to the Thames Barrier on
February 11—basement dwellers
particularly welcome—but we're
s i g n i n g up now, so if y o u ' r e
interested, contact M . Skeates via
the D o C 2 letter-racks.
