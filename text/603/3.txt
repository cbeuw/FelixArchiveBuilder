UGM Report
Inquorate and Insipid
The censure of the Deputy President was the only highlight of
an otherwise mind-blowingly dull UGM on Tuesday.
T h e meeting opened at 1:06pm with approximately 100 students in
attendance and only three (from six) of the I C U Executive present.
Both the minutes of the last E G M and the President's report were
accepted without undue delay before M r W i l l i a m Cortazzi proposed a
motion of censure on the absent D e p u t y President M r Barney
M c C a b e . This was passed overwhelmingly alter formal opposition
from M r Nick Pyne, I C U Welfare Officer, although several U n i o n
Officers later expressed the regret that it hadn't been a motion of no
confidence.
M r McCabe's report was referred to the next U G M . H e finally
arrived at the meeting during the Honorary Secretary's report. This
report was accepted, and M r M c C a b e questioned about the absence of
M i k e before those present were subjected to the childlike bickering of
M r Ledwold and M r M c C a b e over the venue of the meeting and the
arrangements for having M i k e present.
Further reports were presented by Gaynor M c K e n z i e ' R S . M U V P ) .
M a r t i n Taylor ( E A O ) and M i k e Prosser (Chairman of Publications
Board). In his report M r Prosser stressed that the post of U n i o n
Handbook Editor was still vacant.
T h e n at 1:29pm the quorum was successfully challenged b\ M i -
Brian Stevens, Chemistry 2, before the proposed bye-law change* and
motion on grants could be discussed.

New bar Old front
The new Victorian style bar beneath the Southside Halls of
Residence opened last night after a last minute rush to finish
the alterations.
The estimated cost of the alterations is in the region of Â£20,000, most
of which was secured as loans from four breweries: Watneys, Bass
Charrington, Whitbread and S a m Smiths. T o repay these loans the
College are committed to an agreement, whereby an amount is payed
back to the breweries every time a barrel of their beer is sold.
Alterations were started in the Christmas vacation and as deadline*
were not met by the contrators, it was necessary lor them to work
extremely hard to compete the majority of the work on time.
A n added complication for the bar manager M r Ian H a r o l d
M a g n a y , was that the cooling fan in the beer cellar broke down lasi
weekend. This meant that the real ales served last night would probably
not be at their best, he said yesterday lunchlime. However, he
anticipated that the bar would open as promised.

Ritual burning at Putney
V I K I N G W O R S H I P reared its ugly head at I C on, c .i
Saturday, J a n u a r y 23.
The venue was beside the river at Putney and the event, |
the James Bruce Party, had been organised by the Boat
House Committee. As an afterthought they decided to burn out
of their o l d boats w h i c h h a d been a r o u n d since the last war.
'I'he boat was stripped of all useable parts and burnt because il was
wasting boathouse space, unsaleable and unsafe lo row. This is an old
Boat C l u b tradition for boats beyond repair.
T h e ritual had been approved by I C U n i o n , the insurance company
and Police. Unfortunately the Police failed to contact llie lire brigade
who turned up en force (seven lire engines and a lire boat) when
alerted by a passer-by. However, their servies were not needed.
