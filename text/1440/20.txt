ARTS
Quick-start culture list
Victoria & Albert Museum
(V&A):
This museum houses a col-
lection of art and design from
around the world, including
life-size architectural casts
from Italy, Chinese textiles
and Japanese swords. The
National Art Library can be
found here, but if you prefer
some time out from a studi-
ous environment the foun-
tains in the central courtyard
are ideal for more reflective
moments. South Kensington
Science Museum: (above)
Situated right near the heart
of Imperial, you cannot fail
to miss this brilliant and fas-
cinating monolith of heritage
and groundbreaking technol-
ogy. Tours, interactive exhib-
its and even a ‘Night at the
Science Museum’ where you
can hang out with friends
after-hours (for purely edu-
cational purpose only). South
Kensington
Natural History Museum:
(right)
You cannot have missed this
beaut of a building on ap-
proaching Imperial from
South Ken tube. This muse-
um is a joy to wander round,
renowned for its Dinsosaur
collection but also housing
sections on every area of
natural history imaginable:
insects, plants, geology, as-
tronomy, human biology…
Entry is free although entry
to the temporary exhibitions
costs 4GBP for students. Ex-
pect large groups of school
children at any time.
South Kensington
Tate Britain: (below right)
A more grown up version
of its south bank cousin, the
Tate Modern, the Britain is
another spectacular building
inside with endless ceilings
and cool marble interiors.
There is a large amount of
‘older’ art to work through al-
though the temporary hang-
ings often feature modern
artists. Entry is free for most
of the museum, although
some of the non-permanent
exhibitions require an entry
fee. Pimlico
Tate Modern:
Yet another architectural
achievement that requires no
entry fee. Expect only mod-
ern art here with most floors
being permanent collections
that are ‘re-hung’ once a year.
Floors 3 and 5 were rehung
in May and are definitely
worth a visit (includes Andy
Warhol).
Southwark or Mansion House
National Gallery:
This giant spans one side of
Trafalgar square and con-
tains work from some of
Britain’s greatest painters.
Like most of the large Lon-
don museums, entry fee is
only required for the tem-
porary exhibitions. The NG
café serves some scrump-
tious fare to boost the energy
required for making it round
this museum in good spirits.
Charing Cross
British Museum:
Containing all the products
of the British Empire’s pil-
laging efforts over the last
four centuries… Think weird
masks, Egyptian mummies
and a lot more. Again, the
museum is worth visiting to
marvel at the marble and its
construction. Catch it before
everything is returned to
their rightful owners! Don’t
miss this one if you want to
submerge yourself in history
itself.
Russell Square
Cartoon Museum:
Two minutes from the Brit-
ish Museum, this is located
in a very lovely part of town.
The curator of the museum
produces brilliant shows, al-
ways excellently researched
and teeming with informa-
tion for the less informed.
As well as their exhibition
space, the museum has a well
stocked shop and is a must
for anyone into their comic
strips and graphic novels.
Nearby there is also an even
larger, better stocked graphic
novel shop.
Russell Square
Political Cartoon Gallery:
An easy one to miss, this tiny
gallery has a shabby, informal
charm to it with a mural on
the wall downstairs by some
cartoonists. Here you will see
the satirical works of artists
who contribute to the com-
ment and editorial sections
of everything from the FT,
Economist, Times, Guardian
et al.
Tottenham Court Road
Camden Arts Centre:
Not in Camden, per se, but
a haven for art you wouldn’t
hear of normally. It has a
reading room, book shop,
excellent café and a gorgeous
garden to relax in set above
the hubbub of the main road.
Perfect for a quite day out
with a loved one
Finchley Road
Proud Gallery:
Definitely in Camden, the
Proud gallery kills three
birds with one stone: gallery
space, music venue and the
one most original unusual
bars in London. Once a hors-
es stable, the cobbled floor
and roughly painted white
walls still remain which are
adorned with mainly photo-
graphic collections of a mu-
sical nature. Past exhibitions
have included Blues Greats,
Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix
and the current Woodstock
collection.
Camden Town
Serpentine Gallery:
Another small, simple gallery
which hovers on the edge of
Kensington Gardens. It is al-
ways free and quick to walk
around (bite sized, perfect
for a lunch break) and the
exhibitions have never failed
to please. Jeff Koons is pres-
ently on display and his sig-
nature kitsch kiddy-porno
style is easy on both the eyes
and brain.
South Kensington
Wallace Collection:
This out of the way collec-
tion is not to be missed –
home to some of the most
ostentatious and ‘frou-frou’
paintings of the French Ro-
coco and Baroque periods,
as well as some fine exam-
ples of Dutch genre and still-
life painting – it is housed in
a beautiful period building.
Try to resist touching the
wallpaper though. The res-
taurant is excellent and en-
trance to the gallery is free of
charge. Bond Street or Baker
Street
ICA:
Located in The Mall, home
to old money and classic
grandeur, the Institute of
Contemporary Arts is per-
haps an anomaly but is such
a treat to visit. Housing a cin-
ema, a theatre, a bar/café and
a gallery this really is an ideal
place to come on any day (or
night) of the week for fun.
The bands and DJs that play
here are always excellent and
I don’t think there are many
places in London where one
can swig whisky, listen to folk
(or otherwise) within stum-
bling distance of Bucking-
ham Palace.
