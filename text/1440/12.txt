Artist’s impression of the moment of separation of the LCROSS which
happened on the early hours of Friday morning
NASA bomb Moon in
search for water
It was set to be a big event. So big in-
fact, that the state of California had
provided large outdoor screens for
the public to view the live event. On
the 9th October 2009, 12.31pm Brit-
ish time, the spacecraft Lunar Crater
Observation and Sensing Satellite
(LCROSS) crash-landed onto the
Moon at a speed of 5,600mph. NASA
confirmed the empty rocket had suc-
cessfully crashed 100km from the lu-
nar South Pole in the crater Cabeus.
This created a new crater 60ft wide
just a short distance from the pro-
posed location of NASA’s manned
lunar base, set to be completed by
NASA hail mission a success despite claims the impact did not
produce the spectacular dust plume expected

The volume of water that could
be contained in the permenantly
shadowed area of the moon at the
lunar South Pole
2024. It was hoped this ‘bombing’ of
the Moon, which cost $79 million to
carry out, would create a six mile high
cloud of lunar dirt visible from the
Earth. The plume would be analysed
by scientists and used to confirm any
presence of water around the pole -
an essential resource if people were to
travel back to the Moon.
However despite confirmation from
NASA that the crash was successful,
viewers of the event, broadcast live on
NASA’s website, were left disappointed
as there appeared to be little evidence
of any impact whatsoever. In fact the
only evidence that the spacecraft had
crashed on the moon was from data
relayed back to ground control from
LCROSS’s own infrared camera. Eve-
rything leading up to the crash went
as planned following the launch of
LCROSS in Florida back in June this
year. The early hours of Friday morn-
ing saw the craft split into its two sepa-
rate components. First, a 2.2 tonne
empty Atlas V Centaur rocket struck
the Moon to create a debris cloud. The
main LCROSS craft, itself weighing in
at 700kg, followed moments later. The
idea being that it would pass through
the plume made by the first part of the
rocket and collect data before hitting
the surface of the Moon four minutes
after the Centaur rocket.
The full extent of the mission’s suc-
cess is still unknown. Dr Vincent Eke,
University of Durham was involved in
choosing the location for the crash, “If
it turns out to be as dull as it looked, I’d
imagine the soil just didn’t respond as
was hoped to being hit. It might mean
we don’t get sufficient data, which
would be a shame.” Anthony Colaprete,

The total cost of sending LCROSS
into space so far. For 2009, NASA
requested a budget for the year of
$16.2 billion, a 1.8% increase on last
year’s request

LCROSS hit the moon at twice the

Finally, a quote from someone of the
other side that we can cling to. Re-
spected Old Testament scholar and
author Professor Ellen van Wolde has
made fresh claims that the first sen-
tence of genesis “in the beginning God
created the Heaven and the Earth” is
in fact a mis-translation of the original
Hebrew text. A “fresh textual analy-
sis” carried out by the woman herself
has suggested that the book never in-
tended to suggest that god created the
world, instead claiming that the earth
was already there when he created hu-
mans and animals.
The fresh analysis of the original he-
brew text was carried out in the con-
text of the bible as a whole and in the
context of other creation stories from
ancient Mesopotamia.
The conclusion was that the hebrew
verb “bara” (used in the first sentence
of genesis) does not mean “to create”,
rather “to spatially separate”. And so
according to this, the first sentence
should now read “in the beginning
God separated the Heaven and the
Earth”. This contradicts Judeo-Chris-
tian tradition, according to which it
is said god created the Earth out of
nothing.
According to this, the new analysis
now shows that the beginning of the
Bible was not the beginning of time,
but the beginning of a narration. She
says “It meant to say that God did
create humans and animals, but not
the Earth itself”, and that this view
apparently fits in with ancient texts.
According to Prof. van Wolde, the an-
cient texts state that “there used to be
an enormous body of water in which
monsters were living, covered in dark-
ness”, and so logically this fits.
The evidence appears scant as to the
method she used to redefine the word
“bara” since it does technically mean
“create”, but, in her words “something
appeared wrong”. She said that “God
did not create, he separated: the Earth
from the Heaven, the land from the
sea, the sea monsters from the birds
and the swarming at the ground”.
Furthermore, she added “there was
already water.....there were sea mon-
sters. God did create some things,
but not the Heaven and Earth” be-
The ‘Creator’ or the ‘Separator’?

“It meant to say
that God did
create humans and
animals, but not
the Earth itself”
the lead investigator in the LCROSS
mission, claims sufficient data has
been collected to answer the questions
set out to be solved by the mission.
Those leading the project even say the
lack of the much anticipated explosion
could prove to be very promising evi-
dence for water at the crash site in its
own right, if the spacecraft landed in a
lake or icesheet.
This is not the first Moon bombing
to have taken place. In 1998, NASA’s
Lunar Prospector mission crashed
into a nearby crater and confirmed
the presence of hydrogen at the South
Pole of the Moon. However, the dust
produced from the impact was insuf-
ficient to confirm the presence of wa-
ter. If ice is found, the craters covering
the estimated 12,500sqkm of perma-
nently shadowed lunar terrain could
hold as much as 200billion litres of
water. Such a discovery would give
potential for greater Moon explora-
tion once the proposed lunar base
was completed and could even allow
for missions to Mars to be launched
from the Moon.
The mission has come under fire by
critics declaring it as a ‘live-fire test ex-
ercise for US war strategies’ and ques-
tioning the right NASA has to blow
craters into the Moon’s surface at will.
Colaprete dismissed these views saying
collisions not dissimilar in magnitude
to that created by the rocket happen to
the Moon several times a month and
that no explosives were used during
the crash. Since the first lunar probe
in 1959, an estimated 170 tonnes of
material has been crashed into or
abandoned on the Moon as a result
of more than 50 missions to the lunar
surface. By comparision, only 400kg of
lunar material has been brought back
to Earth.
We will have to wait to know the true
success of the mission as NASA have
said they do not expect to announce
any results for at least another two
months. One known success of the
mission was the burial of the ashes of
planetary geologist Gene Shoemaker,
which were carried onboard the craft.
He is only person ever to be buried on
a celestial body.
Genesis: the first book of the Bible where the mis-translation is claimed to have
occured. Professor Ellen van Wolde claims an alternative meaning
fore conclusively stating that “The
usual idea of creating-out-of-nothing,
creatio ex nihilo, is a big misunder-
standing” Quite a definitive statement
there, one which we should take very
seriously, and use to anger traditional-
ists. Finally, a spokesman for the Rad-
boud University said: “The new inter-
pretation is a complete shake up of the
story of the Creation as we know it.”
What this does for the teaching of
creationism or the idea of creationism
on a fundamental level, we probably
won’t find out and no doubt people
will talk about this “finding” for a bit
of light debate. However, at the end
of the day stuff like this comes up all
the time and this story will unfortu-
nately carry no weight in the long
term despite Prof van wolde claim-
ing that “The traditional view of God
the Creator is untenable now”. Trying
to get a quick few minutes of fame,
perchance?
