I’m sure you know but to remind
the readers, the men’s 1sts were
team of the year. Could you give
us a brief overview of the last
year?
Well as you said we were team of
the year. It was the first time the club
achieved an award like that. The first
and second teams are in same division
(BUCS 2A South Eastern Region) and
we did the double on them, winning 9-1
& 8-2. This year we’re in first division,
after going unbeaten and winning both
the league and cup. We hope to push
for promotion into premier league.
The seconds hope to gain promotion
into 1st division this year. The women,
have been in BUCS 1A division, for a
while, pushing for promotion. Hope-
fully this year they will succeed.
Is there anything the club wants
to improve on last year and can
you incorporate that into what
you aim to achieve this year?
We didn’t get much recognition into
felix. That’s our fault. We want to get
more articles into the felixSport pages
this year. The problem is that the team
is very divided from the social. We
want to get more interaction and pro-
duce more value for the social players
Give me a background on how
the tennis club work. For in-
stance what days do the social
players train, likewise with the
competitive team? Is there any
interaction?
The competitive team train on Tues-
days. This year we have Phil Jakeman,
fulltime Biochemistry student, part
time RTP qualified coach. This is the
same qualification Toni Nadal, Rafael’s
coach. Our home matches take place
on Wednesday in Hyde Park. And
Sundays we train at the Queen’s Club.
They have fantastic facilities.
The social team have an extra train-
ing session on Wednesday (1 - 4). They
also train on Sundays (10 - 2). A new
introduction to these sessions is that
we have coaching for the social play-
ers. Members of the competitive team
will be on hand to coach our social
players. To increase the value for these
players we have provided brand new
rackets and balls if a player doesn’t
haven any and we have introduced an
online booking system for the courts.
This is at South Park, which has brand
new, resurfaced courts. It’s about 20
minutes from the South Kensington
campus. If you’re a social member you
pay £29 and competitive team mem-
bers pay £35 per year. Its great value
because to get time on the South Park
courts you have to pay around £10 an
hour.
What are your other prospects for
the year?
To fight for promotion into the pre-
mier league we need some more play-
ers. We lost a number of key players
last year. We really need to recruit. So
for those of you that played a lot before
university but opted for a change and
played a different sport at Imperial like
football or rugby, and are in the sen-
ior years, come and trial with us! Drop
me a mail at lawn.tennis@ic.ac.uk.
Then you can come to Queen’s to trial.
Standard wise, the first team has a host
of county level players though in the
past we have had some international
standard players.
For the social side of the club we now
have an events officer, Pierre Monty.
He has cocktail evenings, casino nights
and entry to private members clubs
all lined up this year. He is also going
to try to get tickets for the BlackRock
Masters at the Royal Albert Hall.
I know you’re always looking for
new players. However, spe-
cifically for the first team are you
looking to make your 2nd players
step up or are you pursuing com-
pletely
new
quality
play-
ers?
There
are one
or two
in the
sec-
onds who
I think can
make the tran-
sition into the
firsts. Over-
all they are at
a very good
standard. The
only difference is
in the mental as-
pect of the game.
Saying that we
do need some
new blood for
the firsts. The la-
dies will definitely
need some new
players.
You men-
tioned about
new events and your new
social secretary. Are you plan-
ning any overseas tours this
year, like some of the other
sports clubs at Imperial?
We are hoping to go on our
first tour for four years. This
will be different because we
will actually play matches
this time. We aim to go
to Croatia and play at
the famous Split club,
where Goran Ivanisevic
and Mario Ancic play.
They have amazing clay
courts and we hope
to set up a mini Davis
Cup where we will go
to croatia one year and
they will come to us the
next to play at Queen’s.
Taking a wider look at
tennis, where do you see
yourselves fitting in the
whole ACC, union and
Sport Imperial. What is your
opinion of these bodies?
Comparing to London Met-
ropolitan and other universities
it is evident that we don’t get as much
attention as the big sports like football
and rugby. If we had a little bit more
money for coaching etc., we could have
developed a bit more. Also, on a media
point of view, there is not much atten-
tion given to the fact that we play in
fantastic facilities like Queen’s. Though
recently after speaking with Samantha
Bell, the new Sports Development Of-
ficer at Sport Imperial she seems en-
thusiastic of the club’s plans this year,
which is encouraging.
