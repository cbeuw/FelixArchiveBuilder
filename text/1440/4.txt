LOAN DELAYS HIT CLOSE TO HOME
A
s the Student Loans
Company (SLC) an-
nounce they are to hold
an internal enquiry into
why over 100,000 stu-
dents have had their loan payments
delayed, felix looked closer to home
and spoke to a few undergraduates af-
fected by the crisis that has hit students
nationwide.
The SLC has received just over a mil-
lion applications for loans in its first
year as the sole authority organising
and distributing student loans. In pre-
vious years, first year students have
applied through their local education
authority, which worked in conjunc-
tion with the SLC to send off loan
payments.
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF DAN WAN SPEAKS TO THREE IMPERIAL STUDENTS CAUGHT UP IN THE LOAN DELAYS
Agnieszka Pinchinat, Peter Evans
and Mary Harrington are three of a
reported 116,000 students across the
country that have still not received the
first installment of their loans. Felix
caught up with each of them this week
to explore how the SLC’s failings are
actually affecting their lives as they
start a new year at Imperial.
They have each been affected to dif-
ferent degrees; a contributing factor
being the year of study they are each in.
Peter seems the worst-off, being a sec-
ond year student discovering the lack
of cushion that College provides you
with in your Fresher year. Agnieszka
is benefiting from being a Fresher and
living in halls, but sees trouble ahead
as the financial uncertainty is added to

dealing with living out for the first
time. Living in private accommoda-
tion with friends means the security
and ease of living in Halls of Resi-
dences are lost; utility bills, monthly
rent and actually securing a habit-
able and affordable place are just a
few of many trials the majority of
2nd years like Peter must endure.
However, unlike most of his peers,
Peter will find this shift in living ar-
rangements much harder, owing to
the fact he still hasn’t received his
student loan.
As required he applied for the
loan during the summer break, and
was due to receive the first term’s
worth of money on the 4th of Oc-
tober; a day before the academic
year at Imperial started. Already
settled into his new Chiswick flat,
the loan did not arrive come the
4th of October. This has now left
him in a very difficult situation in
which he is left desperately short of
money. To make matters worse one
of his housemates has been forced
to move out, leaving the remaining
residents to plug the gap in rent that
has been created. Peter despairs at
the situation.
“I’m truly screwed. I could just
about get away with paying my own
rent for the next month, but won’t
be able to pay the extra rent on time
without my student loan. I have
about £70 left for the foreseeable
future.”
It is a particular bitter situation
for Peter due to the fact his finan-
cial problems would not have arisen
had he his loan on time. He de-
scribes the money a financial “safety
net” he could rely on for emergency
circumstances like the one he has
found himself in.
During our meeting, Peter once
again contacted the SLC to get any
sort of timescale in which he can ex-
pect his payments to come through.
After a solid 20 minutes on hold, the
conversation with the operator last-
ed only a couple more. The answers
to Peter’s enquiries were obviously
quick and well-rehearsed. His loan
application would be processed
in “three to four week’s time” and
was told that applications lodged a
month before his were currently be-
ing looked through.
Despite a reported two month
backlog of applications, Peter’s
three to four week delay seems fa-
vourable. However, this doesn’t
make any difference to an individ-
ual like Peter who is also reluctant
to ask his parents for even more
money than he already has.
“I’m going to have to ask my Dad
for some more money to help me
cover this rent, but I’m ashamed to
do so.” Despite his personal pride, it
isn’t happy days for Peter and most
likely plenty of other students in
similar or worse situations.
On a last note of half-despair
half-comedy, Peter mulls over what
he’s going to be doing for the next
few weeks.
“Looks like I’m going to live out of
tins every night, doesn’t it?”
W
hen asked about her
student loans, she
replies cheerfully,
with a distinct hint
of irony.
“It’s messy!” Mary exclaims. It’s
good to see her in good spirits de-
spite her the position the SLC has
effectively put her in. As she sits be-
hind the Student Activities Centre
reception desk, she beings to explain
that entire situation, and the fact she
has been faultless at every step of the
process.
Her application hit a stumbling
block as soon as it started back in
June; well before the deadline the
SLC set before applications become
‘late.’ Though the SLC prefer the
students to register for their loan
online, Mary’s mother isn’t comfort-
able using computers for something
so important and hence ordered the
paper forms to be sent to her home.
The paper forms did not arrive be-
fore the SLC ‘late application’ dead-
line despite Mary’s persistence on
the phone.
“I tried ringing 40 times in one day,
then another 97 times the next day.
Every time I was put on hold. I was
in tears at this point.”
The application was not only de-
layed past the deadline, but she
would not receive any level of fund-
ing when the academic year started.
The SLC had promised every student
they would receive the basic level of
funding as soon as their term started,
and would receive extra loan money
at a further date. However, this
promise was on the condition that
the application had been submitted
before the ‘late application deadline’.
Further confusion has since oc-
curred. She received an email from
the SLC asking her to supply addi-
tional information about her family
finances in order to complete the ap-
plication. She immediately replied in
a phone call, but was told on the con-
trary. Her application was complete
and the loan instalments were ready
to be released.
Both her Local Education Author-
ity (LEA) and the SLC now have sep-
arate applications under her name,
but neither are seemingly collaborat-
ing to solve her situation.
Mary isn’t visibly anxious about
her lack of money, but describes it
as “worrying.” She gives off the im-
pression that she just needs to get on
with things, and deal with her situ-
ation as it comes. She’s happy to be
working part-time for the Union as
a receptionist, and the pay gets her
by week-to-week, but nothing more.
“I guess I’m really lucky in the way
that I live cheaply. I cycle everywhere
for one thing. I can live off the £30 a
week for now, but any if real expens-
es are needed I will begin to struggle.
I’m currently bobbing up and down
at the bottom of my overdraft as it is.”
Mary mentions she has missed out
on things in the last few months that
she’d really like to have been involved
with. She decided to work over the
period her girlfriends travelled to
Dublin for a holiday. She was espe-
cially feeling the effects of not having
any money when term started.
“I couldn’t go to many of the Fresh-
ers’ events I would have liked to go
to. I’m not going to go there to drink
lemonade,” she says as a cheeky grin
surfaces on her face.
Talking about other sources of
money quickly buries her smile. “My
mum can pay my rent for now, she’s
moved some money around to cover
it, but I don’t like asking for it.”
Mary has seemingly no choice but
to ask her mother for extra money,
but she realises that with six other
children, her mum can only do so
much for her. “I take pride in being
financially independent. I was the
one who chose to come to London to
a six year course. I can’t expect my
mum to support me.”
Mary is looking forward to finally
getting her loan, although she still
hasn’t any idea when it will come
through.
As she gets backs to sorting out
databases for the hundreds of clubs
and societies at Imperial, she has one
last thought.
“I have a list of things I’ll get once
my loan comes through; a haircut
and a couple of pairs of socks to
name a few on it!”
the new social and academic pressures
she is experiencing during her new life
at university. Mary, on the other hand
is a fourth year Medic, and very much
used to living independently. She man-
ages to contain the stresses that having
no money creates with her experience
she’s gained at her time at university.
All three of the students we spoke
to are yet to receive any funding from
the SLC, and even the most prudent
would be struggling. There is little
they can actively do to solve the solve
their problems in one fell-swoop. They
continue to play the frustratingly slow
waiting game whilst it is not just their
bank balance which is reducing: mo-
rale, personal pride and quality of life
too.
