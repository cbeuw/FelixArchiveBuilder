Suffolk boys The Cheek, who changed
their name from Cheeky Cheeky and
the Nosebleeds for “time saving rea-
sons”, have dropped their spiky punk
style as well as the name. What’s left is
an upbeat, pulsing pop record with a
catchy (if a bit mundane) hook and sul-
try Roxy Music-esque vocals. This is a
definite move towards the mainstream
and it’s a good one. - Tom Hird

It’s as though they rounded up Daft
Punk’s guitars, Justice’s child choir,
Mika’s falsetto vocals, and pulled it to-
gether with the synthy pop of Phoenix.
This song would be fun if you were on
a good night out and the DJ dropped
it and you danced like a child after too
many sweets, It’s a one night stand of a
song, really. - Alex Ashford
With a name like that I pictured a
bunch of dirty south rappers, in an ob-
noxiously luxurious lounge of a night-
club, sippin’ on some purple drank.
But actually this new side project of
one of the Fratellis seems to be trying
to prove you can make a decent rock
and roll record with a skilled orchestra.
Too many cooks… Alex Ashford

This embryonic album uses abstract
electronic sounds throughout, and
have psychedelic themes, which can be
a nice change to the sterile, produced
music around today, Ultimately it
doesn’t tap the true power of The Flam-
ing Lips. It’s background music and
greatly self-indulgent. - Luke Turner

Sometimes I wonder if I’m losing the
plot a bit because I hate every whiny
indie rock boy band CD we get sent,
then I hear a song like this, with reggae
legend Horace Andy’s deep vocals over
a crawling trip-hop reggae melody, and
I realize all is not lost. Massive Attack
are consistently head-and-shoulders
above most music. Overall the EP
is dark and introverted, like a weird
weekend come down. - Alex Ashford

Similar in places to other bands like
Big Pink and MGMT with a similar
Indie kind of feel, Little Comets are in-
fectious, fun and easy going. Adultery
as a single is upbeat and melodic with
catchy lyrics that you’ll eventually find
yourself singing along to in the street.
It’s definitely worth a listen on iTunes/
Spotify whenever you’ve got a minute,
and then you’ll probably finding your-
self going to buy it. - Ben Cook

Exhibiting a much more mellow side
the Arctic Monkeys latest taster from
their relatively unemphatically re-
ceived third album ‘Humbug’ is cer-
tainly a highlight. Musically it is one
of the less radical progressions of their
new sound but this single, whilst prob-
ably not residing in their top draw, as
previous albums have left it pretty full,
is still a very worthwhile listen. - Chris

Zero7’s fourth album, has a relaxing
yet uplifting chilled sound. However I
feel their style is stuck a decade behind
current musical trends. The album
lacks continuity with each song sound-
ing as if it’s been selected from a mul-
titude of different artists and ripped to
a single disc. No song, I feel, on this
album will captivate listeners. A disap-
pointing album compared to their pre-
vious work. - Craig Glastonbury

Biffy used to be an incredibly interest-
ing band. The latest single ‘The Cap-
tain’ is anthemic, evidently displaying
ambitions of arena tours. It seems like
their idea of making a chorus interest-
ing is adding some token horns at its
end. It’s a shame to see a band that used
to be exciting, now treading a generic
line of mediocrity. - Chris Walmsley

Ash embark on ambitious A-Z project
Kadhim Shubber speaks to frontman Tim Wheeler as Ash set out to change the music world
T
im Wheeler is a little wor-
ried, excited too of course
but a little worried that Ash’s
alphabetic adventures might
fall flat on their face. He’s just flown in
from New York where he and the band
have spent the last year and a half re-
cording for their A-Z single series. A
matching tour, hitting 26 venues each
beginning with a letter A-Z, begins on
Monday in Aldershot which he claims
is partly to tie in with the single series
and mostly to do with having fun and
“doing things that not a lot of people
have done before”.
The grueling schedule doesn’t faze
him, “I’ve taken up kick-boxing so I’m
fighting fit” he jokes, clearly it’s not
the tour that’s worrying him. The band
are embarking on a project which says
goodbye to the album and hello to
quick-fire singles.
Ash’s gripes about the album have
been well documented since 2007,
when announcing their intentions after
the release of their last album Twilight
of the Innocents, Tim declared that “I’m
constantly disappointed with records I
buy”
The ill-feeling stems from a desire for
greater creative freedom and a reading
of the musical landscape that could
prove to be prescient. “The album was
just so restrictive, with singles we can
experiment more and not be tied down
to one sound like with an album”.
Ash are clearly a band who have no
time for hanging around, for Tim the
album is simply too slow and distanced
from their fanbase. He theorizes that
albums are forced at fans, whereas sin-
gles will allow them to become more
responsive but also without the crea-
tive and financial commitment that a
album requires, allow them to experi-
ment with greater ease.
It’s not only albums that have at-
tracted Ash’s ire, the band have also
shunned the CDs that they’re re-
leased on. The A-Z singles are avail-
able only by digital download and
1000 limited 7” vinyls. “CDs have
become really disposable, people just
download them onto their comput-
ers and listen to them on their iPods
anyway so what’s the point?”. They’ve
also offered their fans magazine-style
‘subscriptions’ whereby they will au-
tomatically receive the singles when
they’re released.
Given that Ash are so eager to tear
the rulebook to shreds it’s interesting
that Tim falls squarely into the Lilly
Allen camp of the current debate on
music piracy. He talks emotively about
the vast majority of people who work
in the music industry on average sala-
ries whose jobs are directly at threat
because of music piracy. To him it’s a
bread and butter issue, while he under-
stands the pro-piracy arguments it’s a
simple case of having to make a living,
“If we could afford to give our music
away for free, then we would”.
Whether or not their venture turns
out to be financially successful (I sus-
pect that with their fanbase, it will be)
Ash have shown both pro and anti pi-
racy advocates a possible vision of the
future; digital downloads, subscrip-
tions, greater interactivity with fans
and ultimately, the death of the album.
What’s all this alphabet business?
What’s the A-Z project?
Ah well, basically Ash are releasing
a single every two weeks, each one
titled A, then B etc until they’ve gone
through the alphabet
No album then?
They don’t make albums anymore!
Really?
Yeah, in 2007 they released their fi-
nal album Twilight of the Innocents
and announced that they would only
ever release singles from then on.
The first came out on the 12th
Any explanation?
Tim Wheeler said basically said
that the album was dead, “It hasn’t
helped that most people have
forgotten how to make a decent
album.”
Controversial?
Yeah but he is fit... .....I mean
talented!
The band’s sound is heavily influenced
by the left-leaning political punk of
twenty years ago, but they are much
more convincing when they put the
fucking placards down for a minute
and sing about something they’ve ac-
tually experienced. The good stuff is
really quite good: it’s just that the bad
bits are dreadful. - Duncan Casey
