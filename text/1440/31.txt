I eyed the remaining bhang lassi. It
was still almost touching the brim. It
was me who suggested we try that af-
ter all, so the responsibility to finish it
rested upon me. I held my breath and
gulped it down.
And then we sat there for a while
waiting for the high to kick in. One
minute passed. Still sane. Two min-
utes. I cracked a joke. No one laughed
but me. Three minutes. I looked at my
mates. They looked back at me. No
one was high. After a while we decid-
ed that it was a farce, bhang lassi was
over-hyped. We left the shop 50 ru-
pees poorer without any form of high.
Embarrassingly, I have to admit,
even more so due to the fact that I am
a biologist, I overlooked something
fundamental about consuming con-
sumables of any kind – it takes time
to go through the extensive human
gut tract. I had forgotten the fact that
usually weed is inhaled and cocaine
is snorted, hence the almost instant
kick. I drank a cup of marijuana lassi.
It takes time to get through my stom-
ach and reach my small intestines,
before being absorbed into my blood-
stream by the numerous villi on the
wall of the intestine.
It is then transported all the way
back up to my brain and nervous sys-
tem. It’s a bit of a big round the way
trip.
So there I was wondering around
Pushkar with a ticking chemical time
bomb in my body.
It wasn’t until when I was visiting
the Brahma temple and having my-
self blessed at one of the nearby holy
bathing ghats that bhang lassi came
knocking onto my senses. And it
wasn’t just a gentle knock.
It started with my eyelids getting
numb. At that time a young ‘priest’
apprentice clad in jeans and T-shirt
was bringing me around the Brahma
temple, hastily explaining the impor-
tant sights in the place. The pot of
gold in form of USD tips at the end
of the ‘tour’ is something he blatantly
looked forward to.
To conclude the tour, I was given
a pink flower and brought to one of
the nearby holy bathing pools. It was
the usual route for tourists – visit the
Brahma temple, say your prayers and
prostate before the statue of Brahma,
then bring an offering in form of flow-
er to one of the holy pool nearby, then
struggle with US Dollar-demanding
priests who moments ago seem like
the friendliest man on earth. I was at
the stone steps of the holy pools when
the bhang lassi effects got stronger
and – to quote Keats – a drowsy
numbness pains my sense.
What followed was the bhang lassi
effect in full blast. And it chose the
best time to kick in. The dodgy priest
was in the midst of giving me a bless-
ing in English and making me recite
it. But things got fuzzy and blurry.
From what I hear from my mates, it
seems that I started laughing as the
priest was chanting away.
After the ‘blessing’ and a pissed
priest, I was stumbling. But the en-
tire time I was still laughing. I walked
with my mates for a few streets un-
til it was too much for me to bear. I
told them to go ahead without me –
I needed to get back to the hostel. I
assured them I could do it myself.
Male ego still reigns amidst drugged
stupor.
Which proved to be a silly mistake.
Now the bhang effect got beyond tick-
ling my funny bones. It was knock-
ing me out. I could no longer distin-
guish faces, my swagger resembled a
drunken crab and reality started to
crumble. I managed to find my way
though and even took a few snapshots
of passing camels.
When I arrived at my hostel, I col-
lapsed on the couch at the reception.
I was too groggy to move further. I
was there for a while, drifting in and
out of consciousness and could barely
hear the staff laughing at my drunken
state. Then one of them took my by
my arms and brought me up to my
room.
Once I was on my bed things got
weird. And surreal. Memories of the
last few hours replayed themselves in
my head, and it all felt like a dream.
Until I woke up sweaty and incapaci-
tated on my hostel bed. I felt like I
had woken up in a dream.
As usual, India had a knack of rub-
bing things in my face. Of all times to
choose, the hostel had electricity cut
for the few hours when my mind was
wedged somewhere between real and
surreal. So, I awoke alone in a dark
room with the door slightly ajar, re-
vealing a dark hallway with noises
coming from it. It would have been
okay normally. But when your mind
is playing tricks on you, it was creepy
shit.
I spent the remainder of the night
lapsing into a living dream, only
waking up again when my friends
dropped by my room to visit. One
took my temperature (I thought it was
extremely surreal he brought a ther-
mometer on this trip…) and the other
came in and said “he’s really fucked”.
I missed dinner and slept all the way
till the morning.
The next morning, I woke up after
12 hours on the bed. I was expecting
a bad hangover after such a delirious
experience the night before. I blinked
a few times. Eyelids not numb any-
more. Stood up and took a few steps
around my bed. Coordination seems
okay. I am back to normal. I sat on my
bed and took a few relieved breaths.
Checked my belongings: passport still
in pocket, wallet still stuffed with ru-
pees and DSLR still intact. That was
pretty good seeing how unhinged I
was yesterday.
Grabbing my Lonely Planet India
from my backpack, I flipped through
the index to search about bhang las-
si. Towards the end of the 1043 page
tome, there is a section about general
safety. In that section there is a small
highlighted text box at the corner:
“caution about bhang…a highly po-
tent derivative of cannabis… endeav-
our at your own risk…some travellers
find themselves experiencing bouts of
delirium and become bedridden for
as long as three days…”
I guess I was pretty lucky to be
fucked up for only one night.
Or would you trust that hand?
Would you trust that hand?
