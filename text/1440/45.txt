been getting very heated recently, as
we finally took the plunge. However
despite my preconceptions of his at-
tributes, it turns out he’s got a MAS-
SIVE chode.
I cannot express my disappoint-
ment, even though his motion is sat-
isfying, it’s hardly detectable. Can
you recommend any positions which
optimise depth but minimise girth?

Dear Virginia,
I have taken the time to research cham-
pion chode positions and have found
the detectable “pan-chode-cake”, for a
full diagram just google it. It basically
entails (surprise, surprise) a lot of “pan-
chode-cake” tossing. This helps the
chode to grow considerably. For emo-
tional support please see the facebook
group Chode Aid.

Dear Aunty McPickle,
I’m sorry to bring up bestiality in
my opening sentence, but I have a
lingering concern that my gardener
may be having sexual relations with
my dog. These suspicions are based
on a disgruntled loss of innocence
in his eyes, paw prints on the bed
sheets and a trowel in the dog bed.
How do I investigate? Regards
Pawla Eukanuba
Hi Pawla,
Thanks for writing in, sounds like you’re
like your pooch has bitten off more than
he can chew.
It might be advisable to persuade your
mutt to stick to it’s own kind, maybe set
up play dates down at the local park?
On the gardener front, set up sneaky
camera in the unsuspecting locations.
It might just be some innocent petting
but for peace of mind it might prove
fruitful. Hope you get to the bottom of
this highly muzzling situation soon.

Dear Aunty McPickle,
I am uncontrollable turned on by
calculator, exams are a nightmare.
I have resorted to suppressing my
randy calculations with images of
abacuses.
I have already been caught once
in WH Smith, when I discovered the
latest Casio model casually sprawled
seductively but yet with such sophis-
tication. How can I sway my woeful
eyes away?

Hi Tash,
I don’t know what to say. I’m not trained
for this kind of heavy duty, stationary
related shit. Please see a psychiatrist.

Dear Aunty McPickle,
I have been seeing a new guy and
things have been going pretty well.
He’s got curly locks, a cheeky grin
and an accent to match. Things have
has been bringing home many arty
specimens. The one he seems to be
most proud of has been having the
strangest effect on me.
I get surges of uncontrollable rage
at just a glimpse at this disgusting
near masterpiece. I have to restrain
myself from grabbing the nearest
crockery and lobbing it somewhere.
I know this all sounds unusual but
I really don’t know what to do.
A Vicious Vinci
Dear Vinci,
It sounds like you’re a sufferer of the
Stendahl syndrome, which causes irra-
tional feelings of anger when exposed to
fine art. This is as physcosomatic illness
which can even produce hallucinations
and is particularly brought by works of
great beauty.
Maybe you should just sit down
somewhere distinctly un-pictorial,
maybe bring some scientific evidence to
help them with the swallowing.
I definitely recommend staying away
from art galleries and Florence but you
can pretty much feel safe in the grounds
of Imperial.
Good luck!

F
inally, after a long, long sum-
mer of waiting, RAG is once
again running some wicked
events to raise money.
Our first one, for the handful of you
which still haven’t heard about it, is
LOST. Here’s a quick rundown:
1. Get onto a bus, blindfolded.
2. Get driven to a mystery location.
3. Make your way back to the Union,
without spending ANY money.
There’s not much more to it! The
teams will be groups of either two or
three, with at least one guy in each
team (just for safety reasons). All this
is happening on Saturday, 28th No-
vember, however we will be signing
people up as of next week (19th-23rd
October) at the JCR (Junior Common
Room) at 1pm.
But how do we raise money, I hear
you ask. Easy. Through funding! You
harass your family, friends, and neigh-
bours etc. to donate. To make things
more interesting, why not set goals
like wearing a top hat for £50, or a
Superman costume for
£100! There will be 3
prizes which will be giv-
ing out for most money
raised, wackiest costume
and craziest mode of
transportation.
To find out more, make
sure you drop by the JCR,
and if you feel like get-
ting LOST for our cho-
sen charity Barnardos is
something you’d be up for,
swing by with your team.
Get LOST, RAG stylee
