The Fire Station bar in Hammersmith where the alleged incident took place
Imperial Medic arrested
A 3rd year student has allegedly been
arrested after a night out organised by
the ICSMSU for freshers.
The alleged incident was said to have
occurred on the night of Wednesday
the 7th of October outside the Fire Sta-
tion bar on Hammersmith Broadway.
As part of the Imperial College
School of Medicine Students’ Union
(ICSMSU) Freshers’ Fortnight, the
Doctors and Nurses themed pub crawl
was a chance for the medical school’s
new intake of Freshers to get to know
each other. However, ICSMSU’s events
are Freshers’ Fortnights are notori-
ous for attracting students from years
throughout the medical school. IC-
SMSU described Wednesday’s event as
“one of the biggest nights of the fort-
night with the whole medschool turn-
ing out in scrubs and nurses outfits for
a pub crawl through Hammersmith”
on their website.
The 3rd year student, who has been
unnamed, was said not to be officially
at the event, but had joined in with
the night’s proceedings anyway. The
situation apparently escalated on the
street outside the Shepherds Bush
Road venue when he reportedly be-
came aggressive towards a number of
people, which included a police officer.
Rumours circulating College suggest
that the officer in question was plain-
clothed at the time. It seems a likely
concept as the Fire Station bar is mere-
ly down the road from the Hammer-
smith Police Station. Students in the
immediate area said there was a “heavy
police presence” after events unfolded.
The ICSMSU’s statement was cagey
and ambiguous about the events.
“This is a great shame. I would like to
thank the ICSMSU exec and the Fac-
ulty of Medicine for their support and
handling the situation very sensibly
and efficiently.”
A student subject to arrest and/or
involved in criminal activity will face
a Fitness to Practise panel held by the
medical school he or she is registered
under. The panel leads an investigation
into the student’s wrongdoings under
General Medical Council’s guidelines
to see if the student’s ‘conduct has
An Imperial College Medical Student is said to have been arrested
on a night out organised as part of the ICSMSU’s Freshers’ Fortnight
shown that he cannot justify the trust
placed in him [and] should not contin-
ue in unrestricted practice,’ as stated on
the GMC website.
The site also state that ‘physical vio-
lence’ as a criminal offence or caution
is one of the ‘most frequent concerns’
that can lead to a Fitness to Practise
investigation.
The worst possible outcome to the
hearing is that of suspension or expul-
sion from the student’s medical course
as the ‘only way to protect patients.’
felix continues to follow the situation.
Beats MIT but not
quite UCL standard
It’s that time of the year again. Wheth-
er it is because it reaffirms boasts of
being here or because it downplays the
cost of not getting into Oxbridge, we
all love the Times World University
Rankings. If you are happy to ignore
international recognition in favour of
the other mark of quality – the Times
is British whereas Shanghai is Chinese
– then the rankings usually make for
self-affirming reading.
This year there has been a mixed
blessing. Imperial has climbed up
from sixth to fifth place but UCL has
jumped ahead to fourth. With our own
rivalry aside, UCL outperforming MIT
demands a second look at the num-
bers. The Times uses six measures to
compose their overall rankings. Two of
these are relevant and objective. One
is specifically staff/student ratio, as
opposed to any measure of staff time
spent on students, which explains Im-
perial doing reasonably well. The other
is the claimed cause of that problem,
the staff/citation score.
Sadly this is not listed as Imperial’s
strong suit. Aside from a few amusing
notes, such as Caltech graduates being
exceptionally disliked by their future
bosses, the peer and employer reviews
all offer near full marks.
The last two components of the
overall score clear up the confusion
nicely. A full third of the marks are di-
rectly based on the internationality of
staff and students.
This as an independent parameter
is particularly lucky for Imperial given
how many of the marks from the other
measures also probably come from this
source. Needless to say, Imperial score
the highest in the top ten for both.
This also essentially clears up the UCL
puzzle.
