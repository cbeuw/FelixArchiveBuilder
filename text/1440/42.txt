Bloody Union
Fun Police

S
ince when did the union
start to employ Fun Police? I
don’t know if it is just that it
is a new year, and they are all
being extra cautious, or they
are actually serious. Last Wednesday
we played the Medics, and won. Thus
it was necessary to celebrate in style.
We like to do this by standing on the
tree of woe in the Quad and drinking
beer. I like it there, it’s comfortable and
I can see everyone. However, this ac-
tion has been banned by the bloody
Fun Police. For those of you who don’t
know about the tree of woe, you can
probably have a pretty good stab into
the dark to decide what it entails. It
is a tree, where you will be woeful for
actions you have committed. Many
dirty pints have been consumed there,
and many left there, but it’s just a bit
of harmless fun. However every time
someone stands upon its hallowed po-
sition, some Margaret runs over and
gives you a right bollocking. I’m not
sure I think this is acceptable.
What is the worst that can happen?
Is it only me who thinks if you fall over
and hurt yourself, it is you that is to
blame? Not the floor, not the fact that
there wasn’t a warning sign, not the
fact that nobody stopped you. It’s your
fault you twat. To be brutally honest
if you need a warning sign saying that
water coming out of a hot tap is going
to be hot, then you deserve to burn
yourself.
My idea of fun, before Union antics,
is to spend my time standing on the
goal line of a hockey pitch, waiting for
someone to hit a ball at me. I think that
that little white ball can cause consid-
erably more damage to someone than
the tree of woe.
Aside from that rant, thank you all
for writing in with so many answers to
the puzzles. I will be putting the FUC-
WIT in next week. If I can be arsed,
which at the minute is very much touch
and go. I really need a puzzles bitch to
come and help us out. It will only take
about two hours a week, and if nobody
comes down I am going to have to pull
some of the puzzles out. You may have
already noticed that there is no Nono-
gram again this week! So please please
come down to the West ing of Beit to
have the time of your life! Literally the
amount of laddish behaviour that oc-
curs here is unfathomable.
Stuff Imperial students like:
3. Gym:
Not 100% sure about this one, but
seeing as Imperial has the only free
University gym in the country we
all kinda love it.
The fact that you can rock up
for a quick gun sculpting session,
or a splash about in the pool with
a bunch on 9 year olds, all for free
is pretty epic. The end result is the
biggest (by percent) student en-
rolment in the gym, and sporting
clubs as a whole. For freshers, you
have to have an induction to ensure
that you don’t get tangled up in a
weights machine and strangle your-
self. Boring as shite, but you have to
do it.
Finally, the real reason that you go
for a session is not to buff up, but
to sit on the bikes and check out
the arses of the girls who are on the
running machines. Don’t say you’ve
never done it as it is impossible not
to. Seriously, check it out.
Women. Guns. Weights. Nice.
“I just broke up with someone and the last thing she said to me was “You’ll never find anyone like me again!” I’m thinking, “I should
hope not! If I don’t want you, why would I want someone like you?””

Graphic Dingbats
I quite like these dingbats, and you all seem well pleased that you managed to
get them too. I can’t remember what the answers were, but there was rubbish
Cliff Richard one and Jealous Guy by Roxy Music. Have fun with this week’s.

Apologies to a certain Tom Roberts, a victim of mistaken
identity in last week’s Lovestruck. We’re so sorry we
caused you so much embarrassment. Man up, son!
