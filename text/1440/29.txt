Fashionably
Late
H
ello and welcome. I believe
that Dan the Wan, our Edi-
tor in Chief, received an
complaint about the lack of
Arts in felix. Oh well, here we are, we
are just fashionably late.
This year we have added two regular
sections - the News Strip and the Cool
Wall. News Strip - does what it says
on the tin. Cool Wall - not the most
groundbreaking invention ever, but the
prospect of printing some cool people
in cool outfits at Imperial does excite
me. Maybe I shouldn’t promise that it
will forever be full of cool people, then
those of you who should have been ar-
rested by fashion police years ago can
be named and shamed. And then per-
haps come to the realisation that look-
ing shit is an offence.
Now, turn and look around you.
There are in fact plenty of scientists/
engineers who do match their inner
beauty with their looks. So don’t give
me this “argh, I am not an arts student
so what do you expect” bamboozle. Not
a valid excuse, Ok?
While I’m on the matter, every year
people complain about the male to fe-
male ratio at Imperial. But who is going
to discover your inner beauty when you
dress in a rotten carrot and look like
you’ve been pooed on?
On a more serious note, felix is the
perfect place for you to express your
love of fashion. We are always finding
new talent, so if you’ve got some inter-
esting projects in mind, email felix.fash-
ion@imperial.ac.uk and tell us how you
can help.
Moving on... next week, The Daily
Telegraph’s Fashion Director, Hilary
Alexandra talks to felix– what are Gal-
liano and Lagerfeld like in real life? She
tells felix all about it. Oh yeah, and if
you need more convincing to write for
us, here’s why. We meet amazing people
like Hilary. We may even meet Lily Cole
or Giles Deacon one day. Who knows?
I can’t possibly write anymore than
this. Well, I could, but I’m not going to.
So farewell. Until next time.

Good news for Imperial fashionistas.
After years of dormancy and almost
on the brink of club closure, the soci-
ety has finally found a new committee
vowing to salvage it.
The Fashion Society’s Freshers’ Fair
stall attracted plenty of interest, with
more than 300 students signing up to
the mailing list, proving Imperial is
not, despite popular opinion, a style
desert.
The society’s first dress making
workshop, run by Topshop designer
Emile Carr, saw attendance of more
than 20 students learning the basics of
design and sewing. Students will learn
to modify old clothes as well as mak-
ing a piece from scratch. According to
the committee, the finished pieces will
all have a chance to be showcased at
the society’s planned fashion show in
April.
For anyone who has ever dreamt of
creating a fashion show of their own,
this might be a chance to show off their
skills. Members of the society will have
a chance to sign up for a number of
responsibilities from music to styling,
guest-listing to modelling.
Fashion society will also run a host of
fashion related events such as a clothes
swap and make-up sessions, as well as
a tour to Paris. The society hopes to
broaden their members’ styloscope by
absorbing the French fashion capital’s
unique style culture. Students will be
able to wander on Paris’ streets dur-
ing the Autumn/Winter Paris Fashion
Week in March.
President Ling Li hopes that the
society can act as a cohesive force to
unite all fashion aware people across
Imperial and also to spread the mes-
sage of “dress well and feel good about
yourself”.
The society’s next event, the “Open
Fashion society wakes from dormancy and is eager to please.
COOL WALL

Session”, is on the 20th October and

browse the society’s large catalogue of
international fashion titles.
