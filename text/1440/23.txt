Week 1 of 2: Festival Review

A
t last! A warm Glas-
tonbury! After about
five years of flooding,
storms and trenchfoot,
the Pilton faithful were
rewarded with an absolute corker of a
festival, with the best line-up in years,
a couple of new fields and some real,
genuine sunshine (obligatory Thurs-
day night monsoon notwithstanding).
After much prevaricating, this year
also saw Mr Eavis et al. accept what
everyone else there has known for
years. Maximo Park kicked off the fes-
tival a day earlier than traditional, with
a rousing (and packed-out) set in the
Queen’s Head. Avoiding the crowds,
we checked out beatboxer extraordi-
naire Beardyman in the Dance Vil-
T
his summer I had the de-
light of attending Latitude
Festival in Suffolk. Hav-
ing never been before and
not knowing many of the
artists performing, I approached the
festival with an open mind, bring-
ing few expectations with me. As it

No ‘lets go fucking mental’ chants
so many music reviewers do) to try and
convey just how brilliant this festival
was, but I’d rather not waste my time
or yours with such ridiculously preten-
tious, overly flamboyant, unnecessary
and ultimately meaningless twaddle.
This festival was brilliant for so many
reasons, but overall, it was simply
the friendly atmosphere and endless
amounts of brilliant and sometimes bi-
zarre things to see and do, that made it
such a wonderful and refreshing expe-
turned out, Latitude Festival was the
perfect place for this way of think-
ing. Not a moment went by when I
was bored. The enormous selection
of music, comedy, theatre, film, liter-
ary and poetry performances, plus
a huge number of interesting places
to eat and drink, could have kept me
busy for a week (had I been given the
opportunity).
I could fill this review with reams of
adjectives, metaphors and similes (as
rience. These days, so many festivals
front a warm, fun, friendly atmosphere,
which simply masks an uninviting, sor-
did, surly, dark, dismal and somewhat
menacing weekend of drugs, violence
and filth. In sterling contrast, Latitude
is exactly what it says it is; a pleasant
and welcoming weekend that provides
genuine, unadulterated and whole-
some fun. I would recommend this
festival to everyone, regardless of their
taste in music and arts.
26 reasons why
Latitude Festival is
a ‘must-go’
lage, before beating a hasty retreat in
the face of a small army of neon-ed up
East 17 fans out looking for a trip up
Irony Memory Lane. Veteran DJ An-
nie Nightingale led the energetic (and
maybe a little mashed) masses into the
wee hours, but by that point I was sat
around a campfire in the Stone Circle,
laughing at hippies and ruing the fact
that our rather tasty bottle of single
malt had been confiscated by Security
on the way in.
Friday’s breakfast was interrupted
by the carelessly-forgotten opening
set of the festival proper, by the ever-
entertaining Björn Again. I say inter-
rupted, as I’ve got an allergy to Abba
that brings me out in screaming fits,
so we went to relax in the Acoustic
tent which was reassuringly free of
crap 70’s disco. N*E*R*D brought us
out of hiding, though - despite being
delayed by 30 minutes due to equip-
ment problems, Pharrell Williams was
determined to give the crowd a full
set - an ambition which was termi-
nated abruptly when the stage man-
ager pulled the plug to set up for the
Fleet Foxes. Never a band troubled
by a lack of self-belief, they performed
the rest of their song from the front of
the crowd anyway, even as the road-
ies were dismantling their kit around
them. The Specials were the inevita-
ble highlight of the day, though, bash-
ing through all the two-tone classics
with an energy that belied their… let’s
call it ‘experience’, and treating the as-
sembled throngs to an hour of intense
skanking action.
A little befuddled from a heavy night
in the chaos of Arcadia, Saturday’s ac-
tion really got going around lunchtime,
with the Eagles of Death Metal’s com-
edy cock rock. Not necessarily a band
I’d pay to see again, but not a bad intro
to Spinal Tap at least, who emerged
after a gap of some twenty years in
all their tasteful, understated glory.
Dancing midgets in monks’ robes?
Check. Open-chord bass lines, turned
up to 11? Check. Ah… the good old
days were back, for a glorious forty-five
minutes. Even Jamie Cullum sounded
good, guest-appearing on keyboards -
there must have been something in the
air.
The mood was promptly ruined by
Dizzee Rascal, who I still don’t quite
understand the point of. Featuring the
single lamest tribute to Michael Jack-
son of the festival (we knew he’d died
due to the sudden influx of paedo-
phile jokes on everyone’s phones), Mr
Rascal hammered through just about
every song he’s ever recorded in his
set, culminating in Bonkers - which,
you’ll be glad to know, is still rub-
bish. Kasabian rescued the day, with a
swaggering set that finally lifted them
above Oasis-tribute-act status, but
they were always playing second fiddle
the Boss, Bruce Springsteen himself.
With more gas than most acts half his
age, the rapturous crowds absorbed
two and a half hours of his trademark
blue-collar rock; although the Timmies
and Hermiones who make up about
thirty percent of Glastonbury’s crowds
nowadays didn’t always get the point, a
massive crowd cheered every song well
past the curfew and into ‘Boss time’,
thundering to a finish with the crowd
pleasing Glory Days.
Conscious of the increasing fragil-
ity of the audience, Sunday kicked off
gently with a bit of reggae and veteran
rockers Status Quo, who gathered an
vast crowd considering their early slot.
Enter Shikari disappointed, consider-
ing the fluency of some of their ear-
lier live work, but Tom Jones got the
whole festival crooning along in what
effectively became the world’s largest
karaoke booth. Madness picked up
the tempo again immediately, carry-
ing on where the Specials had left off
on Friday: having not played the festi-
val in ten years or more, they brought
the full show and played through the
pain induced by a drinking session the
night before that immediately became
festival lore. The Prodigy’s lacklustre
attempt to close out the festival did
them no justice at all, but Blur did a
superb job in their first big live show
in a decade, charming the crowds and
making everyone wonder why they
stopped the first time around.
Easily the most varied, most intense
and most important festival of the
year, next year is Glastonbury’s 40th
anniversary and the smart money’s on
U2 to headline. I’ll see you there.
