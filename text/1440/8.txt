COMMENT
Hassan Joudi: A career in Defence? No thanks.
“I’m proud of my
invention, but I’m
sad that it is used by
terrorists... I would
prefer to have
invented a ... lawn
mower”
A
s yet another academic
year starts it is another
opportunity for employ-
ers to recruit. The month
of October sees the an-
nual ritual known as the milk-round,
the trekking of company HR teams
from university to university, attending
all manner of careers fairs, to interest
and sign up talented final year students
to their graduate programmes.
A feature of Imperial career fairs is
the high concentration of arms compa-
nies, which rightfully raises some ethi-
cal concerns among the student body.
Perhaps owing to Imperial’s focus on
science and engineering degrees, and
our high-up-the-league-table status,
arms companies seem to find a per-
fect recruiting ground here in South
Kensington.
When final year students come to
choose which employers to work for,
after years of hard graft at Imperial,
numerous factors are obviously con-
sidered like starting salary, job location
and employer reputation. The impor-
tance of each of these factors will of
course vary from student to student,
but I would say that the ethical values
of the companies we apply to, especial-
ly with respect to arms companies, is
just as important.
I have called them “arms compa-
nies” up until now, but they prefer to
call themselves the “Defence Industry”.
At last year’s IC Union Careers Fair in
2008 for example, we had BAE systems
and Selex Galileo exhibiting, and other
“Defence Industry” big names includ-
ing Lockheed Martin UK, DSTL,
Marshall Aerospace, ITT and
Raytheon Systems to name
but a few. On their
websites and
brochures,
their ‘About
Us’ blurbs talk
about “advanced
electronics”, “inte-
grated security solu-
tions” and “land, sea
and air defence tech-
nologies”, but behind
all the euphemisms it
doesn’t take an Impe-
rial student to figure
out that these are al-
ternative ways of saying
“we make weapons.”
The word ‘arm’ is
short for ‘armaments’,
the weapons used in
military warfare. These
include large military
hardware like jet fight-
ers, missiles, tanks, land
vehicles and battleships,
as well as small low-tech
equipment like pistols, rifles, grenade
launchers, munitions and landmines,
and all the accompanying technologies
that come with it. Few people will tell
you that there is a shortage of weapons
in the world, in fact the general con-
sensus is that the world has too many
weapons, fuelling various conflicts and
wars in the world.
A shocking statistic comes from
the United Nations Security Council
(UNSC), the highest inter-govern-
mental body charged
with maintaining
international peace.
Arms companies
in the per-
manent five
countries of the
UNSC: China,
France, Russia,
the UK and USA
together manufacture 75%
of the world’s weapons. These weap-
ons are either sold to the country’s
own government (domestic market)
or exported to foreign allies (foreign
market). Who are the top recipients?
Developing countries with the money
to buy them of course, including ris-
ing economic superpowers like India,
ex-Soviet states like Poland or oil-rich
Middle-Eastern states like Saudi Ara-
bia, Egypt and the UAE.
Estimates put the global amount of
money spent procuring, or buying,
arms from private companies at 1 tril-
lion dollars a year, as these developed
countries dedicate large chunks of
their military budgets to beefing up
their own armed forces. It’s no secret
that corruption, and political manipu-
lation, is common place in this weap-
ons supply chain. In December 2006
BAE systems was about to be investi-
gated on criminal
charges relating to bribery in the sale
of Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft to
Saudi Arabia in a £6bn contract,
until they successfully lobbied
the then-British Prime
Minister Tony Blair
to intervene
and halt
the en-
quiry.
Recently in
October 2009 BAE corrup-
tion again resurfaced in the news as
they risked being taken to court, this
time to answer allegations of paying
bribes to win contracts in Tanzania,
Romania and Czech Republic. In fact
the international arms trade has been
labelled by Transparency International
as one of the three most corrupt busi-
nesses in the world.
I believe we should not be doing
things in life just because it earns us
a good monthly salary. This is the at-
titude of low-skilled occupations like
migrant labourers, factory workers or
even prostitutes because they have lit-
tle or no other choice on how to earn
their livelihood. As an Imperial gradu-
ate, despite the fewer graduate vacan-
cies available in the current economic
recession, we are gifted with choice,
variety and options in what job we do
in life.
As Imperial students we learn tech-
nical knowledge and skills that most
of the general population don’t have
the ability to learn. Surely there are
more useful ways of using our techni-
cal knowledge than designing
things which kill peo-
ple, or worse in-
jure or maim them. If ever
you are in any
doubt
of the
power
of modern
conventional
weaponry, you can
just walk down Exhibition Road and
see for yourself. Opposite the Science
Museum on the east side of Exhibition
Road lies the V&A museum, where
next to the Exhibition Road entrance
is a section of wall damaged by bombs
dropped on London by Nazi Germany
during the Blitz in World War II.
The damaged section has been in-
tentionally left there and text inscribed
next to it as the picture above shows.
This wall in London is the closest thing
you can get to a gutted apartment
block in Lebanon or a bullet-ridden
school classroom in Sierra Leone. Run
your hand over the deep dents in the
wall, feel the hardness of that stone and
imagine what that could have done to
human flesh. A boyish obsession with
tanks, guns and all-things military is
understandable while fragging ene-
mies in Halo 3, Call of Duty or Counter
Strike: Source, but transferring it over
to real life is quite frankly ridiculous.
Aircrafts and bombs are examples
of larger military hardware, but small
arms can cause just as much damage
and human suffering because they are
present in greater quantities. Post-co-
lonial Africa is a continent character-
ised by civil war, and with few weap-
ons factories of its own, it’s no surprise
that 95% of ammunitions and arms
used in African conflicts come from
outside Africa. It begins with legal
sale of arms to African states, much
of which occurred during the Cold
War in the 1970s and 1980s when the
US and USSR backed dictators of their
choosing. Through the black market,
thousands, if not millions, of Glock
pistols, AK-47 Kalashnikov rifles and
other handheld weapons fell, and con-
tinue to fall, into the hands of war lords
and armed gangs.
Amnesty International estimates
there are 600 millions guns in circu-
lation worldwide. While private arms
companies, particularly those in the
permanent five UNSC countries, are
happy to manufacture and sell to any
buyer they can find, it’s the humans
in poor war-trodden countries
that pay the price in
bloodshed and
lives lost.
Whilst
not ig-
nor-
ing oth- er
causal fac- tors
of conflict like
political disa- greement,
religious schism or access to resources,
it is clear that easy availability to such
weapons is a major cause of sparking
and elongating conflicts. Numerous
international treaties exist which at-
tempt to control the development,
manufacture, stockpiling and use of
weapons. But the global defence in-
dustry is a powerful one with a long
history of lobbying politicians, and for
most people who work in it the impact
of their products matters little, as long
as the sale makes a profit.
By now you might be thinking I’m
some ardent pacifist, completely
against war in any situation whatsoev-
er. Well I’m not, because self-preserva-
tion or self-defence is often necessary
- like in the Nazi bombing of London
in the 1940s - and for this reason, ad-
vanced weapons and the companies
that manufacture them are vital. What
I am arguing is that the lack of ethi-
cal behaviour of companies like BAE
systems and Selex Galileo, and the
ultimate use of most weapons in the
world today, should be of major con-
cern to us Imperial students who they
seek to recruit. Those of us applying
to the graduate schemes of companies
in the “Defence Industry” should think
again. There are enough weapons in
the world today, but a million other
ways for Imperial students to use our
knowledge of science and engineering.
Mikhail Kalashnikov, the 89 year old
Russian inventor of the infamous AK-
47 rifle, said in an interview in 2002,
“I’m proud of my invention, but I’m sad
that it is used by terrorists... I would
prefer to have invented a machine that
people could use and that would help
farmers with their work - for example a
lawnmower”. Echoes of this quote lie in
Albert Einstein’s remark on his role in
the development of the nuclear bomb,
where he said, “If only I had known, I
would have become a watchmaker.”
