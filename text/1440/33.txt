Danger for SideKicks
Trouble in the cloud puts users at a loss, Samuel Gibbs reports
Where’s the
silver lining?
A
nother week, another
tech launch. This time it’s
Windows mobile in the
spotlight, or should I say
Windows Phone? Yeah, rubbish name
I know, but Microsoft wants to transi-
tion towards a ‘Phone’ brand and away
from the Pocket PC days of Windows
mobile. Windows Phone is still only
Windows Mobile 6.5 and as such still
sucks in my opinion. A dated mobile
operating system that simply hasn’t
kept with the times. I know there are
going to be a few of you who are still
passionate about pocket Microsoft,
but look at the lengths companies like
HTC go to just to skin the UI and make
it user friendly.
However, it’s not all doom and gloom
for Windows mobile in Europe at least
as we got the launch of the HTC HD2.
This is an absolute beast of a device
with a massive screen, Snapdragon un-
der the hood and a whole lot of HTC
UI magic up front.
Amazon announced this week that
its highly sought after US only Kindle
e-book reader is going international.
The new GSM based Kindle will be
heading to over 100 countries and
will be available in the US for $279. Of
course international pricing has yet to
be announced, but I wouldn’t be sur-
prised if we get screwed with the cur-
rency conversion and it’s at least £279
in the UK. Feature-wise it will be iden-
tical to the current generation Kindle,
so except for the Amazon book store
access there’s not that much you can’t
get in a Sony reader. Amazon haven’t
announced that their ‘academia aimed’
Kindle DX will make an appearance
out of the US, but to be honest it’s not
cut out for what Amazon are aiming
at. Until we can scribble on the screen
and e-ink displays increase their re-
fresh rate, they’re simply not going to
be useful for reading text books or pa-
pers. Believe me I’ve tried and it’s not
worth the hassle.
Good news for UK iPhone users
seeking a way to watch TV on their de-
vice. BBC’s iPlayer has been available
for some time on Apple’s golden child,
but those seeking ITV, C4 or Five pro-
grams have been out of luck. Into the
breach steps TVCatchUp.com, with
an iPhone optimised site with free live
streaming of 11 TV channels includ-
ing BBC, ITV, C4 and Five channels
in impressive quality, on WiFi at least.
Those without an iPhone can still get
in on the party with over 30 channels
streamed live on TVCatchUp.com.
OK, a free initial signup is required
and the streaming is supported by ad-
vertising, but free live TV streamed
anywhere in the UK is nothing to be
sniffed at.
The cloud took a bit of a knock this
week with T-mobile’s disaster com-
pounded by Apple’s Mobile Me service
having serious problems. Private user
data was displayed to the world and
the service has been pretty flakey all
week. Still where some fail, others tri-
umph, with Google pushing out shared
folders to it’s Google Docs online of-
fice suite. Big news if you happen to
use the Google service as you can now
share whole folders full of documents,
spreadsheets, PDFs etc instead of just
single documents. If you happen to be
working on a collaborative project you
might want to check it out.

Weekly Wrap Up – The Best of the Rest
S
o what’s been happening this
week? Well, Rupert Mur-
dock’s been making waves
this week with two announce-
ments. First up we’ve got Sky Songs
music streaming service, a Spotify
premium competitor, which is due to
launch Monday next week. For £6.49
or £7.99 you get unlimited streaming
of over 4 million tracks as well as 10 or
15 MP3 downloads respectively. Sky
are marketing this as the ‘mainstream’
users service, providing music to those
who don’t know much about technol-
ogy or music. Sky also said that its
iPlayer like service, Sky Player, would
be coming to the Xbox 360. Sky Play-
er in the living room on the 360 with
both live streaming and On-Demand
content sounds like a winner to me,
although I would swop Sky for Netflix
streaming any day of the week. There
will of course be fees involved and may
be bundled in with certain Sky packag-
es, but you may end up seeing Premier-
ship football on your Xbox in the near
future. Sky Player for the 360 is being
launched on the 27th October.
ently Apple has put out a bootloader
update that essentially makes the
iPhone 3GS unjailbreakable by cur-
rent methods. Why it took Apple so
long to do this is anyone’s guess, but
it’s a major setback for the iPhone Dev-
Team and friends. On the App front,
Directed Electronics have released an
app that makes it possible to remotely
start, lock or unlock your car from
anywhere in the world with just your
iPhone. The free Viper SmartStart app
hooks into their remote start in-car
system allowing you to start your car
from the comfort of your home should
it be freezing outside. Of course this
could also be handy if you have a part-
ner who repeatedly locks themselves
out of their car. You can unlock it for
them even if you’re halfway around the
world on business.
On the theme of phones and port-
able gadgets, nuclear batteries may
soon be powering tiny tech. The nu-
clear isotope cell, a development of the
University of Missouri, can provide up
to 6 times more power density than
chemical cells and for potentially hun-
dreds of years. If you are hesitant to
shove a nuclear battery in your pocket,
remember that you already stick a po-
tentially highly explosive chemical mix
C
loud-based solutions hold
a lot of promise and are
certainly in the spotlight
at the moment with more
and more being off-loaded to the inter-
net. Whether it be your email, online
storage, bookmarks, contact syncing
or even your backup, pretty much eve-
rything is moving to the cloud. There
are many potential benefits of this kind
of solution, one of them being that you
have access to your data wherever you
go. Most of you will have used web
email like Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo Mail
or even the Imperial Outlook web ac-
cess at some stage and therefore can
attest to this up side. But, inherent in
the design and operation of cloud so-
lutions there are problems that could
cause major issues if you rely solely on
these services. One of them is discon-
nection; this is probably the most fre-
quent problem with cloud-based solu-
tions. For email, an outage of a couple
of hours might not be too much of an
issue, but what about services such as
cloud computing and storage? Well
this week has been one of the worst
weeks for cloud computing of all time
and it all revolves around user data.
T-Mobile has been selling the Side-
Kick line of devices for a long time now.
For those unfamiliar with the SideKick,
it’s basically a messaging feature phone
and a popular one at that. It accesses a
server for basically everything it does,
including the basics like looking up
contacts. Everything that’s stored on
the phone is uploaded to the SideKick
servers where it is accessed whenever
you do something on your phone. It’s
safe, secure and convenient. So much
so that most people using the phones
won’t even notice it. Well, that is until a
problem arises and that’s exactly what
happened this week for T-mobile in
the US. To cut but a finer point, some
idiot screwed up on the server side of
things, failing to make a decent backup
of users data before doing a ‘routine’
upgrade on the server. Rumour has it
the upgrade was out-sourced to Hi-
tachi and ran into ‘complications’. The
net result was that Danger/T-mobile
lost all the data of a fair few SideKick
users with little to no chance of getting
it back. Now you would have thought
that this just meant that the data that
SideKick users moved to the server
was lost. Although this could poten-
tially be a big deal, it would not be the
end of the world. However, due to the
way that the SideKick works, anything
that’s not on the server but still on the
phone is lost when you reboot or turn
off the phone, essentially like stor-
ing it in RAM only. T-mobile issued a
statement to all SideKick users urging
them to not let the phone lose power,
reboot or take the battery out. Lack
of access is one thing, but total loss of
all your user data is a whole other ball
game, especially when it arises that it’s
due to the human error of not back-
ing up properly for an upgrade to in-
frastructure. Admittedly your average
user doesn’t backup their data nearly
enough. It can be a faff, it’s boring and
it’s something you don’t think of until
it’s too late. For a company storing user
data on its servers, backup is essential
and should be thorough and automatic.
For Danger to lose all its users’ data
from a paid service is totally inexcusable
and someone is absolutely certain to be
made recently unemployed.
There are two key ramifications of
this disaster, one being it will ‘prob-
ably’ never happen again. The other
is that users might think twice about
relying on cloud-based solutions even
for everyday tasks. You might think
that Google or Microsoft or any of the
big players are immune to this kind of
mistake, but let’s not forget that after
a recent purchase it’s Microsoft who
now own Danger.
So if you’re a keen cloud user, and if
you’re reading this you probably use
at least one cloud solution even if you
don’t realize it, you should take note of
all the SideKick users’ plights and think
about backing up. Whether it’s your
phone contacts, your pictures, your es-
says or your banking records, don’t just
rely on the provider to back up your
stuff, make sure you have at least one
local copy. Backup now and forgo the
pain of lost data.

know about you but a tiny battery that
lasts for years not hours would be an
absolute blessing.
Not quite nuclear, but still pretty
explosive, NASA declared war on the
moon and commenced a bombing run
in the ‘name of science’, broadcasting
the whole event live on NASA TV.
The LCROSS satellite was deliberately
smashed into the surface of the moon
in an effort to find water. It was hoped
that the impact would create a cloud of
dust from the crater that could be ana-
lysed for the presence of water. If water
does exist on the moon it will certainly
be easier to make it a pit stop on the
way to future planets. Each kilo of
water costs about £12,500 to send into
space, which makes Evian look like a
cracking bargain.
Next up we’ve had a couple of inter-
esting titbits of iPhone news. Appar-
