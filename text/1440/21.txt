White Cube (Mason’s
Yard):
This small space stands alone
in the centre of St. James’s,
literally, designed by MRJ
Rundell & Associates, it is
one of the first free-standing
buildings to be built for 30
years in this area – so worth
visiting alone for its struc-
ture. Due to its size it does
not hold a permanent collec-
tion, but has regular exhibi-
tions of contemporary artists
(also known as YBA’s) such
as the controversial Chap-
man brothers and the experi-
mental Marc Quinn.
Piccadilly or Green Park
Smaller Greats
National Portrait Gallery:
Slightly dwarfed by the Na-
tional Gallery, the National
Portrait Gallery features
works only of people (you
won’t find any landscapes
here). There is a permanent
collection upstairs which
is free and the ground floor
hosts a temporary exhibition
which is almost always in the
Top 20 London exhibitions.
Charing Cross
Wellcome Collection:
Henry Wellcome, medic, ex-
plorer, philanthropist, has
his collection of weird and
wonderful discoveries ac-
cumulated during his years
traveling the world exhib-
ited here. Includes chastity
belts, human tattoos (yes,
torn clean off their person)
and Hieronymous Bosch’s fa-
mous painting The Garden of
Earthly Delights. Downstairs
are always several fantastic
exhibitions, usually with sci-
entific or medical leanings,
given Wellcome’s status as a
doctor. Adjoined is a small
Waterstone’s and a Peyton
and Byrne café which must
surely serve the best cakes in
London. Euston
Royal Academy of Arts:
The height of academic ar-
tistic excellence was to be
found at this establishment
under Sir Joshua Reynolds in
the eighteenth-century (a bit
like Imperial’s scientists). To-
day, this privately-led institu-
tion holds regular retrospec-
tive exhibitions of the greats,
including Van Gogh and J.
W. Waterhouse among oth-
ers. The highlight of the year
for fans of this establishment
is the Summer Exhibition,
which takes place in its larger
galleries and showcases tal-
ent selected from over 10,000
applicants – from amateurs
to Royal Academicians, such
as Tracey Emin. Entrance
to exhibits normally costs
around 7GBP concession.
Green Park or Piccadilly
Courtauld Gallery:
This relatively small gallery is
by no means minor in its col-
lection. It is home to a per-
manent group of artworks by
some of the most influential
artists of the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries, includ-
ing Edouard Manet, Paul
Gauguin and Matisse. There
are also regular temporary
exhibitions, with a number of
talks and educational discus-
sions, as the gallery is part-
nered with the Courtauld
Institute – a prestigious and
exclusive establishment at
which to study the history of
art. Somerset House is a fan-
tastic building, with many of
its own events, including a
beautiful outdoor ice rink for
the winter. Free for students.
Holborn
Hayward Gallery:
Situated in a cultural hive of
activity, the Hayward shares
the South Bank with other
great locales such as the Na-
tional Theatre, The National
Film Theatre, Royal Festi-
val Hall. It is set above and
back from the main riverside
promenade with its concrete
exterior belying the fantas-
tic exhibitions that are laid
on here. (Although many
will argue that the Hayward
is an architectural achieve-
ment) Expect the interior to
metamorphose every time
your return for a new show.
For more underground art,
catch graffiti artists working
their magic in the area (bot-
tom left).
Embankment
Barbican: (below right)
A bit like a much larger and
more established ICA, the
Barbican injects a lot of cul-
ture into an area that is oth-
erwise an executive haven,
combining theatre, cinema
and art spaces under one very
ample roof. The building is
reminiscent of the open plan,
airy and enormous National
Theatre and its auditorium
really is exceptional. Needless
to say the food and drink on offer also
make the Barbican worth
visiting if only for lunch or
cocktails. Barbican
National Theatre:

An absolute palace of a thea-
tre. Open plan, airy and set
over 4 floors, this theatre
on the South Bank has three
sumptuous auditoriums and
always has a great production
on. As well as this it hosts
free music evenings in its
foyer and is right next door
to the National Film theatre,
Hayward gallery, Royal Fes-
tival Hall, London Eye... the
list goes on.
Escape the trains of clueless
tourists here and be prepared
to come out feeling treated
and very relaxed.
Embankment or Waterloo.
Barbican’s Theatre:
Located inside the Barbican,
this theatre is one of the most
spacious, comfortable and
glamorous looking in Lon-
don and located at one of the
most happening hot spots or
culture.
Barbican
Donmar Warehouse:
(left)
Small, black and simple and
nestled down one of Cov-
ent Garden’s many cobbled
streets, the plays here are
always amazing and always
feature brilliant acting talent
with many a familiar face ap-
pearing on stage mere me-
tres from where one sits.
Covent Garden
