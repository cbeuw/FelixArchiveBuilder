IC Represent Great Britain & Germany
at Rowing World Championships
Adam Freeman-Pask has become the
8th wonder of the world despite a suc-
cessful sabotage attempt on his boat
the day before the opening heat of the
LM1x. Club mate Ole Tietz (represent-
ing Germany), raced in the lightweight
8+ (LM8+) and now ranks 6th in the
world. In the lightweight pairs (LM2-
) IC student Oli Mahony claimed fifth
position with pair’s partner Ross Hunt-
er. Ex-IC rower Ro Bradbury also pro-
gressed to the finals finishing fifth in
the world. In the final medal standings
GB and GER shared first position with
nine medals ahead of the USA who
took home 7.
After a very successful World Cup
season for Freeman-Pask (who claimed
two bronze medals and a fourth place
position), there was great expectation
for the World Championships. Howev-
er on the morning of August 23rd (less
than 24 hours before his first race),
Freeman-Pask was witness to a Ger-
man squad boatman “accidentally” cy-
cling through his boat; which was rest-
ing bows on the ground. The bow was
taken clean off. The boat was sent to
emergency intensive care, placed on an
IV drip and repaired, but was a source
of worry for the lightweight sculler.
The German saboteur is now on the
run after making outrageous claims
about GB Coach Steve Trapmore try-
ing to de-rig the GER heavyweight
men’s 8+ the night before the final, in
which they later won.
German press has suggested coach-
es were unwilling to take a chance on
Freeman-Pask becoming a distraction
for IC’s Ole Tietz before the race; it
is thought Tietz was consumed with
making headlines on the club website
and receiving more hits than Freeman-
Pask articles had previously recorded.
Freeman-Pask finished second in the
first two opening rounds (07:13.14,
07:36.23), behind the Netherlands and
Iraq respectively. Freeman-Pask was
unable to make a top three position in
the semifinal to qualify for the A final,
but finished second in the B final. This
takes his world ranking from last years
13th place to 8th.
In the opening heat of the men’s
lightweight 8+ Germany (Tietz) mir-
rored Freeman-Pask’s opening round
and took second place. With fewer
competitors than the single sculls
event this directly qualified the eight
into the A final. With tough competi-
tion the Germans struggled to get into
medal contention and finished 6th in
05:43.40; ten seconds behind the Ital-
ian winners.
Despite the GB-GER tensions be-
tween Freeman-Pask and Tietz, both
countries ended up top of the medals
table allowing ill feelings between the
IC lightweights to dissipate. [Note:
Since publication of this article POD
has been made aware of the fact that al-
though equal on medal count Germa-
ny took the FISA team trophy AHEAD
of Great Britain. The source of this in-
formation must remain anonymous for
legal reasons, suffice to say dissipation
of ill feelings may have been a prema-
ture statement.]
Imperial boasted two representa-
tives on the GB coaching team: Steve
Trapmore and Stuart Whitelaw. Both
did a great job with their clients with
special mention to Stuart Whitelaw
who coached the mixed adaptive coxed
four to gold and clocked a new world
record. An injured POD had spotted
this talent earlier in the year during her
arms & body 2 km test when Whitel-
aw’s keen eye for detail allowed her to
post a PB. More critically he was one
of the few to not laugh (in her face) as
she was sent to the corner with her erg
out of view of other testers who may
be distracted. Word quickly spread and
when the original LTAMix4+ coach
fell ill, Whitelaw was called into action.
The crew (Vicki Hansford/James
Roe/Dave Smith/Naomi Riches/Rhi-
annon Jones) claimed victory over
the 1000 metre course in 3:25.33; over
three seconds ahead of second placed
Italy. They posted a new world record
making this the second world record
Whitelaw has been involved in this
year. Well done Stuart and congratula-
tions to all athletes!
