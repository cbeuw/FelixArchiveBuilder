Women
win again
This Wednesday was the official start
of the season and lucky as we always
are, we had to go all the way to bright-
on to play our first match with our
brand new squad. Needless to say that
this took us most of our day and was
quite a mission (especially for some of
us, will not name names….(Tanya our
former captain).
So off we were the three of us (new-
comers Gigi and Siree, and me) (Tan
was gonna join us later)) to start our
match at 1. brighton is quite a strong
team and they actually managed to
beat us last year. But with the scary
situation that we faced last year (nearly
being relegated! when we use to win
our leagues every year), we knew we
had to win this one and get a good
start against one of our most serious
contenders.
We all got started with our matches
pretty fast. Looking at Siree and Gigi’s
match from the court where I was
playing, I could see that they were hav-
ing good rallies but that our girls were
winning most of the points. Indeed, Si-
ree finished pretty quickly which is not
surprising since when we arrived at the
courts the captain from the other team
explaining to Siree’s opponent how to
count scores in tennis! So here we are
with already one win by our new medic
fresher.
Gigi’s win was soon to follow as she
was already one set up when I was still
struggling in the middle of my first set.
I had already play my opponent last
year and the first set was fairly tight,
and after failing to win my set point I
lost the set( I know…..). My opponent
Julie got a good start on the second,
guess I was still annoyed to lose the
first set, but after she was up 2-0 I de-
cided that it was enough and went on
to win 6 straight games and once the
second set. The match was then de-
cided by a championship tiebreak that
I won 10-3. So here we were, already
garenteed a victory!
Now let’s come to the funny bit! Tan-
ya was supposed to arrive around 2, so
let me explain to you why she turned
up at the courts at 3ish. See, when you
get out at flamer’s station (from which
you can actually see the huge white im-
possible to miss tennis club) you can
leave the station from two sides. Tanya
took a chance and picked the wrong
one. This resulted in my phone ringing
during most of my match.
But she managed and finally got
here, all red obviously (probably a mix
of exhaustion and shame (please let me
tell you that this is soooo not like Tan-
ya to be a mess). And there she started
but sadly was up against a really , really
, really good player that had no mercy
for her, which resulted in tanya losing .
Next week we are playing Port-
smouth at South Park.

Last weekend, the lads of IC Men’s
Gaelic Football team assembled and
took the trip west to St. Mary’s to rep-
resent and hopefully regulate a tourna-
ment in the curtain raiser to this year’s
campaign.
With a well attended first training
session behind us, IC were comfort-
ably able to field two teams playing 7’s
football as opposed to the usual 15 a
side.
The format for the day was to be a
blitz against hosts St Mary’s, Brighton
University and a local entrance from
Round Towers GFC.
In the first of four matches to be
played IC played against a much fa-
voured St Mary’s tea. It is worth point-
ing out that Mary’s usually compete
two divisions above IC in the top flight
of the British Gaelic Football Cham-
pionships. Mary’s were made to work
hard against an energetic performance
of IC who had no care for their op-
ponent’s reputation and brought the
game to them in a spirited fashion.
Opening exchanges were tit-for-tat,
IC even going ahead at one stage before
Mary’s showed their class and ran away
with the match in the second half with
a brace of goals.
Our next match was against a new
opposition in the form of Brighton
University.
The beach boys made the journey up
with the best of intentions but their
newness to the game was evident and
IC’s relative experience came to the
fore with us comfortably dictating the
pace and possession of the match from
the midfield taking some fine scoring
opportunities along the way.
IC having entered two teams then
were due to play each other. With a
changing of teams into IC Blues and IC
Whites the game was a exhibition af-
fair with team members trying to em-
barrass each other and generally make
a name for themselves.
Our final match of the day was
against a very strong team from Round
Towers - a Senior London team.
The two teams IC fielded were auda-
ciously shuffled so we lined out our top
7 to take on the old hands of the game.
In possibly our best performance of
the day we took the game to RT and
like the first match of the day, IC went
ahead before conceding some goals
which would ultimately decide the out-
come of the match.
At the day’s end IC finished in 3rd
and 4th place in the tournament ahead
of Brighton while RT went on to win.
Against some fine opposition the boys
did the blue and white proud and if the
weekend performance is anything to
go by IC will be flying high once again
this year at National Championships in
February.
Special mention to Padhraic Com-
erford who easily walked away with
most improved player of the day, by the
third match creating several threaten-
ing attacks on his first day playing the
game. Strong performances by Michael
McGarvey and Sean Dunne in goals
helped the team out greatly.
And of course team ‘bomber’ Ste-
vie G who actually managed to score a
goal in the course of the day. Well done
Gallagher.
