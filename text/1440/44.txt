Cancer
The Judge’s gavel
pounds down with a
nerve shattering boom.
“LIFE!” he hisses at
you, his face contorted
with pure hatred. Your
shitty, miserable excuse for an existence has now
come down to 30 years in a 3x3 metre box. Kiss
goodbye to your sphincter muscle mate, that
massive black guy in the cell adjacent to you has
already lined you up as his next bitch. Fail.
Virgo
You seem a little dirty
this week. You have
about 20 numbers and
560 new friends on
facebook after Freshers’
Week. Still you have
no friends. What do you do now? Hire a hooker
to the Union on a Wednesday night, make her do
the most sordid sex acts you can imagine in front
of her, and then send her the fuck back to Soho
where you go her. Respect though. Pint?
Gemini
The policeman takes
a deep breath and
looks you directly in
the face. “Rape, my
friend, is a serious
crime but murder is
the worse crime you can commit”. “Murder?”
You exclaim in horror. “She died of internal
bleeding, God knows why you shoved a span-
ner in her anus”. “But I was told to present my
tool!!!” You cry in disbelief.
Pisces
Next. Pisces. You are
cutting it fine. You step
out of line again an I
shit you not I’m going
to punch your liver out
of your loose anus. I am
not impressed with your progress at Imperial and
for fucks sake I hope you improve. Either that or
vomiting through your nose will become a regular
occurrence. In the coming weeks I hope for your
sake that you learn how to drink beer.
Leo
Oh shit mate, you
fucked this one up eh.
What’s all this lesbian
pullage going on, now?
We’re not in a staged
frat party porn video.
You know what I’m talking about lads. Eh? Oh
look at that fella, probably you, you’ve got so
excited about it all you’ve blown your top. Quite
literally. Everywhere. The room’s fucking sticky.
Fucking well done, mate. Lick it all up then. Twat.
Aries
You are still wiping
your eyes in disbelief,
everyone here looks
different! 18 years
spent in a shitty little
mining town in a bleak
corner of Yorkshire and now London, full of peo-
ple of various colours and shapes. Is this girl what
they call “Chinese”? She’s quite hot in a strange
way - that’s known as the Yellow Fever son. Now
back the fuck off ‘cos she’s mine, all mine.
Scorpio
You’ve been eating
baked beans all week
because your student
loan still hasn’t come
through. NASA have
rung up the College ask-
ing for you. They think you could help launch their
next rocket with the amount of gas you’re building
up. You’re a national treasure. You’ll be farting and
eating beans on TV and Radio in no time. None of
this felix bullshit. Who writes these anyway?
Libra
You’ve still got no
friends, and quite
frankly you’re trying
quite hard now. Well,
take out a blender, or
buy one from Argos on
High Street Ken, put your hands in, and threaten
to switch it on until someone in your hall says
they’ll spend the day with you, most probably
watch you masturbate in your pants at the mere
thought of having a ‘friend’
.
Taurus
Fuck! There she is
again. Should you go
speak to her? She did
add you as a friend
on facebook, but you
were really drunk
when you met her. No! What are you doing, you
shy fuck?! Don’t go prowling her corridor in the
vain hope of meeting her. Bash open her door,
present your tool and ride her from behind until
the bedsheets are saturated with blood. Simples!
Capricorn
You find yourself back
in your mate’s room in
halls after a night in the
Union. You’re having a
really good conversation
when you suddenly get
a hard on. Oh shit, mate. What do you do? Well,
get that ginger-pube inhabiting-snake out of there
and make use of it! Rub it up against the walls and
place it carefully between your mate’s mattress and
bedstand. He looks on in disgust. You’re a fucker.
Aquarius
You fucking fresher
cunt. What do you
think you are actually
trying to achieve?
Please fuck off back
to your own shitty
little life and live it out without getting anyone
else involved. I hate you, your family and your
long lost grandmother. Do the world a favour
and jump into the Thames, get sucked down by
the current and drown

Sagittarius
This week you wander
into your room to
find your parents
rampantly having sex
with your roommate.
“A threesome!” you
exclaim. “Not for you, my son,” says your Dad.
Wow, rejected from a threesome, involving your
own parents, who are old, a bit plastic looking
and have quite frankly lost all their moves. Your
roommate seems to enjoy the slow thrusting.
