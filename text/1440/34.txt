Halo Oh-that’s
not-bad-DST
H
ullo, and welcome to
a more full-flavoured
week of felix Games.
We’ve got our team of
writers now in place -
thanks, those of you that turned up at
Fresher’s Fair - and we’re getting settled
in for a winter of good gaming. Part of
that preparation is our Ten Long Years
feature, which charts the last decade of
gaming. It’s been an eventful ten years,
and probably the decade that turned all
of us into the gamers we are today. We
kick off this week with the year 2000,
along with the chance to win some
stuff.
I played Halo: ODST for the first
time this week, and it’s not bad at all.
I’ve been more impressed by the spin-
off games than the core Halo series,
weirdly enough - Halo Wars seemed
perfectly pitched as an entry-level
RTS, with some really clever altera-
tions for the console, and ODST is a
similarly simple, wholesome game.
It’s not spectacular, there’s not much
to get excited about, but some aspects
of it show some flair and creativity.
Which makes sense, since the fran-
chise is being handed to all sorts of de-
velopers now, but it’s clearly not being
milked off carelessly. And that’s always
nice to see.
I had a discussion, as we prepared the
Ten Long Years feature, about whether
the Halo series was any good at all.
Someone said it’s very generic sci-fi,
and that seems about right. But it re-
ally comes together in its design, which
is something that’s easy to overlook
with a game. The weight of everything
in the Halo universe is just so, and that
means that when you start interacting
with it, something very generic can be-
come much more because you’re in it
and it’s as you imagined it.
That’s what weight’s about in games,
I guess. It’s nothing to do with actual
realism - CoD4’s weapons are weighty,
and I’ve never seen a real gun that
wasn’t being held by a bemused mem-
ber of the Met. Instead, it’s to do with
how we think they should feel, how we
imagine them feeling every time we
watch Die Hard or Black Hawk Down.
So when we get in the game and dis-
cover a match between our imagina-
tion and what we’re being shown, it
gives us a little bit of extra satisfaction.
And that’s what Halo is all about -
being part of a generic world. ODST is
dull at times, but really it’s only if you’re
watching. The videos and screenshots
can’t convey what it really feels like to
play, and it feels like there’s a battle go-
ing on that’s larger than you can see. So
when it comes down to it, I think Halo
probably is deserving of its place in the
last ten years of gaming. But maybe not
for the reasons that everyone thinks.

Fun? What is
this, CBBC?
C
hrist alive, writing the
news is hard. So much
bollocks happens in this
industry, it’s hard to
work out what’s impor-
tant from what’s just aimless, pointless
nonsense spewed out by Gamespot’s
lowest of the low. The cocks over there
genuinely seem to consider press re-
leases big news. Subscribing to their
RSS must be like sitting next to a tramp
on a four-hour coach trip - every few
minutes, you get a warble of drivel, and
then everything smells of piss a bit.
Anyway, games, right? Right. I played
Lucidity today, you can find my gen-
eral opinion on the whole affair to the
right of these words. You may need to
travel over other words to find it, but
it’s worth it because Lucidity is fuck-
ing marvellous. Hell yes it is. How did
you spend your week? Playing fucking
prop hunt on Team Fortress 2? You
wasted your life. How does that feel,
eh? The knowledge that you could’ve
been playing a beautiful, well-balanced
piece of art - yes art, you fuckers, I’m
Kieron Gillen’s bitch - and instead you
were off having fun. ‘Fun’. Woop-di-do,
look at you. If games were about fun,
then we’d all be playing Crash Bandi-
coot and snorting sherbert dip-dabs.
Actually don’t do that, you get a
nosebleed.
Anyway, assuming you’re too cretin-
ous to actually play such a magnificent
game, the least you can do is go and
make generally approving noises in
the direction of LucasArts, whose back
catalog on Steam continues to amaze
me.
Next week - Mirror’s Edge, and why
failing constantly is part of growing up
and becoming a man you whiny fucks.

Ten Long Years - 2000
I
t’s the Year 2000. Approximately
no-one is using Steam, the Inter-
net is still a confusing realm of
drugs and nerds as far as the me-
dia are concerned, and you’re still in
secondary school (actually, the thought
that some of you may have been in pri-
mary school has just occurred to me - I
don’t like that thought).
But what a year for games! Good lord.
So as this decade winds down in an
orgy of good games releases, we’re go-
ing to flick back one year per week with
some thoughts on the best and worst
the year had to offer. We also want
your thoughts each week, so if you’ve
got some memories of what you were
playing in 2001 (penis jokes notwith-
standing) drop us an email at games.
felix@imperial.ac.uk. This week, we’ll
be giving away a free game from Good
Old Games to one lucky entrant, so
make sure you’ve sent something over
by midday on Monday 19th October.
2000 can only ever mean one thing to
me - The Sims. Not because I played
it a hell of a lot, but because it was so
vastly different to all that had gone
before. Yes, I did the delete-the-swim-
ming-pool-exit thing that everyone
says they did like they’re some kind of
inventive genius,
but that wasn’t
the main thing.
You could
build elaborate
houses. You
could make
your friends
kiss each other
in ways you
would later
find extreme-
ly uncom-
fortable to
watch.
The
nice thing
about
The Sims
is that
it’s a real
game. You
know, a
genu-
ine,
bona fide, would-you-like-to-have-fun
kind of game. There’s honestly very
little challenge, even if you play by
the almost nonexistent rulebook, and
it’s a good way to start off a decade in
games that was all about drawing in
the outsider. The Sims was where that
all began.
It was also the year of Perfect Dark,
the slick first-person shooter that had
a brief spell of domination on the N64.
One reader reminisces; “Perfect is
right, this game was sublime. If you
didn’t play it at the time then you prob-
ably won’t enjoy it now but back then
everything about it was incredible; the
graphics, the guns, the gadgets, the
AI, the voiceacting, even the plot was
pretty damn good! In a shoot-em-up!
What they managed to achieve and
squeeze out of my dear little black box
is frankly incredible. Goldeneye was an
impossibly tough act to follow for Rare,
but hot diggity f**k, they only went and
did it anyway.”
It was also the year of the PlaySta-
tion2 launch, the beginning of one of
the most infamous reigns in console
history that would last for years (and
is still arguably continuing today).
Many will have fond memories of the
one bastard they knew that bought
one at launch (if it was you - you’re a
bastard, you bastard) and probably
having a bash at Tekken Tag Tourna-
ment, staring in disbelief at visuals that
would soon become dated and blocky.
Sign of the times, et cetera.
As one behemoth arises, another falls
- Looking Glass Studios collapsed
this year, despite releasing the sublime
Thief 2, a game which many cherish to
this day. As if that wasn’t enough for
PC Gamers, this was also the year of
both Deus Ex and Diablo 2, making a
trio of games that still stand up today
as great pieces of entertainment.
“Before this I had been playing a
fairly awful chat-based browser type
Diablo thing called ‘Vagabonds Quest’
in which you pick a character, level it
up by fighting fellow chatters and buy
more gear. It was thrilling to me.
“Then I got my paws on Diablo II and
my mind was blown. It was exactly the
sort of game I’d always wanted to play,
Witharoundtenweeksoffelixleftthisdecade,andtenyearsofgaming
tolookbackon,joinusaswereminisce(andwinafreegame,too)
and good lord did I put some hours
into it.”
For those of you who’ve not had a
chance to play it - this game that’s now
very long in the tooth indeed is still
played by tens of thousands of people
every day, on Blizzard’s online server
network. It’s a stunningly enduring
game, whose sequel will have to work
very hard to impress and outlast it.
Another key release in this year,
quite quietly across the pond in North
America, was the demure point-and-
click adventure game The Longest
Journey. Heralded by many to be the
finest game of its kind, TLJ was des-
tined to remain a cult classic from its
release, a brave stab at truly story-led
adventuring in a decade that was to
begin to shift its mainstream ways to-
wards action, guns and more action.
Its sequel, Dreamfall, captivated a
small audience in much the same way,
and the team that worked on both, led
by the inspirationally creative Ragnar
Tornqist, is to launch an MMO next
year with a similar feel. It’s certainly a
development team that were precise in
every release they made.
Next week - 2001, Final Fantasies,
gruff noir detectics and Uri Geller.
Don’t forget - send your thoughts in
to games.felix@imperial.ac.uk for a
chance to win a game from GoG.com!
See you next year.
