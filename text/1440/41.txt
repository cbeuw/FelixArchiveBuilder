South America, Africa, South-East
Asia and Reynold’s Bar. What do these
exotic places have in common? Yes
that’s right, the violent removal of
democratically elected officials.
But while the people of Fiji are ac-
customed to members of the military
turning on the government, it’s only a
recent phenomenon in the impover-
ished hell-hole of the Medic’s Ham-
mersmith campus.
Tension had been building for weeks
and culminated last Wednesday, the
7th of October at approximately quar-
ter to awesome, when Mr Chopra was
“gooned in the face” as one above-aver-
age Medic so eloquently put it.
Conflicting reports suggest that the
now disgraced former-President has
fled to the Brazilian embassy near
Marble Arch where he is planning his
comeback. An insider at the Brazil-
ian embassy told Hangman that “he’s
working out every day, running, lifting
Anil Chopra is violently removed by guy much bigger than him
Hangman’s fool proof guide to

A pessimist’s
guide to
rearing
N
ostalgia. The good old days.
Sepia-tinted memories of
childhood. Gleefully ac-
cepting a present from
Santa as you bounce up and down on
his knee.
I should point out, however, that this
is hangman. Those sepia-tinted mem-
ories become low-budget Crimewatch
reconstructions and parents issue a
desperate plea for Santa to return their
child.
Gone are the days when you fear that
you’re going to be the laughing stock of
the maternity ward, with a disfigured
mutant for a baby, a girlfriend who
blames you for the defective gene and
a doctor that has the unfortunate task
of telling you that abortion is actually
illegal once the thing has come out of
the vagina. Don’t despair! You can just
catch a flight over to Delhi and flog
the thing off as the reincarnation of
Ganesha!
Children are there for one reason and
that’s indoctrination. Don’t let them
grow up, only to have their dreams and
aspirations crushed by devastating re-
ality. Crush them yourself!
That’s right, when they discover a
dead bird at the bottom of the garden
and they ask you why it’s not mov-
ing, you calmly place a hand on their
shoulder, look them in the eyes and
say, “One day, that’s going to be you!” If
at this point they don’t burst into tears,
push them over. Life is shit! They need
to know this!
Remember to point out, as you fin-
ish reading your daughter pleasant
tales of princes and princesses, that
they most likely won’t live happily ever
after because one in three couples get
divorced, one in three of us will get
cancer and the other one will be a les-
bian. If, after this, she still insists that
she wants to be a princess then tell her
she’s too fat. They’ll only learn self-
deprecation when they’re older.
In essence, children need to learn
that having fun is NOT ok! Be realistic;
if you see a spectacled boy pretending
to pilot a fighter jet, remind him that
he’s spectacled and tell him that he can
play as a mechanic or a chef. Sit back,
relax and watch him cry!

Hangman spoke to a group of Med-
ics yesterday morning who were recov-
ering from another drunken night out.
“Yeah it’s cool that he’s gone, I mean
as long as I’m allowed to drink loads of
snakebites, get naked in Reynold’s and
throw up on some girl’s tits then I’ll be
happy.”
Some questioned the failure to re-
spect the democratic wishes of the
student body, “It’s simply not demo-
cratic, why did this guy get to punch
him in the face? What if I wanted to do
it? Now the chance is gone forever, it’s
just not right.”
For most Medics however, daily life
has continued without change. It’s not
clear what the new regime intends to
do now that it has the reins of power.
They’re likely to follow policies that
will be popular amongst the vast ma-
jority of Medics, including free rectal
examinations, 80% proof gin and a day
off, sometimes... No sorry the last one
is just a crude joke.
