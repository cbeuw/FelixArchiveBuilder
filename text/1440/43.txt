How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number of lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be one
continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

Solution 1439
I am glad you all decided to send in so
many entries last week, well done to
Susan Jones who was the first off the
mark, and a little too keen for my liking
with her Friday submission.

Solution 1439
As promised, last week’s was a
topical answer, and can be seen
to the left. I am not feeling spe-
cial again, so can’t be arsed to do
the full solution. Get over it. This
issue’s I can assure you is child-
ish. Big well done to Dave Jones.

Going underground
So, all the Arsenal was the correct sta-
tion for last week. Personally I think
it a bit of a dump, but meah. Each to
their own. This week’s is a little closer
to home. Well done to Ian Fulton who
was the biggest fan last week. Remem-
ber to get those answers in quick.

= 2+1+14+11=28. Job done.
So which London tube station sums to 71?
_ _ _ _
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.

physics lectures, and I like what I

I finish off your quantum problem

“You, eating a baguette in the SAF
cafe. Me, staring at you from first
level of SAF. We caught eye contact,
you cowered and pointed me out
with a look of disgust to your friend.
Drink?”
Sexy, I promise
I understand you wanted meaning-
less sex, but really I wanted love.
We did it, but it turns out I have
VD. Now that’s what I call love. We
finally share something. Ring me.

“I’ve lost my boyfriend to an iPhone.
Bare depressing. He’s satisfied in
every way too. That iPhone’s been
into places the sun don’t shine.
Vibrate mode I presume. I’m just
another App to him now. Anyone
fancy a drink?”
