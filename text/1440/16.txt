Finding, Investing in and Growing
L
ast week I came across an
intriguing company. It was
a new start-up called Find-
InvestGrow, or FIG, which
offers a completely unique
and exciting service. If this article is
beginning to sound like the ones we
get paid to write, mostly for big City
recruiters, it is not – they really are this
awesome. The best thing about them
is that they seem to do everything ex-
actly how you would think it should
be done. Investors make money from
people pitching ideas to them, so it is
strange that they make themselves so
inaccessible. FIG allows entrepreneurs
to develop their business plan online
using a unique step-by-step method.
If there are specific weaknesses, they
help resolve them. The process swiftly
identifies those ideas that deserve no
more of their pursuer’s time. It also
allows good concepts to develop fur-
ther through supporting events such
as workshops, until they are ready to
be pitched to investors. These are peo-
ple hand-picked by FIG to understand
where student start-ups are coming
from and not screw them over.
At first the company seemed to have
question marks hanging over them.
Walking along Princes’ Gardens to
meet them at the new Eastside restau-
rant on a brisk Monday morning, I had
a sense that this would or would not
go well. I was certainly not surprised to
meet a pair of highly impressive figures
with a clear and strong vision of where
they were and where they wanted their
businesses to go. But I was also pre-
pared for an offer of a free London flat
as long as I first sent the key deposit to
its Nigerian clergyman owner.
My suspicions about the company
were based on them sounding so good.
Since a certain US presidential cam-
paign in 2008 I’m not too surprised
to see big things not well covered by
mainstream media, but this seemed
exceptional even for them. So I asked
about it, earning the decisive answer
“because we’ve only been doing this
for three weeks.” We can be fairly sure
of seeing and hearing a lot more about
them in the coming months.
FIG offers a broad mix of services to
support would-be student entrepre-
neurs with great ideas and potential,
but not much else. They have partner-
ships with everyone from patent law-
yers to design specialists, selected to
reduce the risk of new start-ups losing
out to unscrupulous suppliers for want
of experience. They seem to have re-
ally thought this through.
I suggested we meet at Eastside
thinking the place was an example of
universities taking students more se-
riously and trying to nurture creativ-
ity. It turned out to be an appropriate
venue for a different reason. James
King, FIG’s founder, was surprised at
how expensive everything was. “Stu-
dents are not the people to be milk-
ing,” he complained. This understand-
ing of student poverty combined with
an underdeveloped sense of the value
of money was further shown when

interviews its founder James King, and its biggest success story: SpineStrength’s Doug Higgins
We often hear that recessions are a
great time to start a business. FIG was
more realistic about this, suggesting it
may be a mixed bag.
“Hard times force you to do things
differently, so investors are going to
be more open-minded, and it will be
easier to talk to them,” Mr King noted.
On the other hand, many companies
and individuals have less money to in-
vest. This should not be accepted as a
blanket excuse, however, “we actually
turned down someone who wanted to
be a FIGurehead for that reason.
Another FIGurehead pointed out
something he had said, which was un-
acceptable. Remember these people
are all high net worth individuals. If
they tell you they are doing badly, they
probably still have at least £10 million
in the bank. Or even £1 million; its way
more than you need.”
So the lesson is to use the recession
to your advantage. You can often claim
discounts because of it, but you should
not afford the same opportunity to
others.
One of Mr King’s friends got £700
Wimbledon tickets for £250 using
the ‘times are tough’ argument. At
the same time, he has seen many
investors try to gain larger equi-
ty for their investment using the
same line, but climb down against
determined negotiation from the
entrepreneur.
interview and found many more peo-
ple with an interest in starting their
own business than we expected. Three
issues repeatedly came up: whether
this is a good time to get started, how
an idea can be developed and pro-
tected at the same time, and what to
do and avoid in order to maximise the
chance of success.
A great idea is the most important
thing that FIG looks for. Other than
this, Mr King recommends thorough
research, “you’re all students; you
should know how to research. If some-
one comes and says ‘I think this [piece
of gym equipment] will support the
back because I think it will,’ that’s dif-
ferent from ‘I’ve done all this research
and it points to...’ Know your market
and your product.”
He would not name the most comi-
cal evaders of this rule, but said, “I’ve
had seven people phone up and say
they want to start up look-alike agen-
cies because ‘my friends all think I
look like a celebrity.’ I just tell them ok,
google ‘celebrity look-alike agency’.”
Another thing to avoid is phoning up
to pitch an idea. The website makes the
process extremely clear and straight-
forward, “but they still phone up and
well, I’ll listen to what they have to say
but that tells me immediately that they
have not looked at the website.”
Another piece of advice was “I am
so pleased when people tell me they
would like to set up a business but are
going to wait until they have a good
idea...don’t just say ‘I’m going to do my
own thing, and I’ll think about what it
is later.” And if you have no good ideas
yet? “Clubs and societies are a good
place. I know here Imperial entrepre-
neurs is quality but also...sports clubs,
ethnic societies...anywhere good ideas
he talked about expensive campus
societies.
This is also how he views his busi-
ness. Clearly there are substantial costs
involved in starting a new venture
and seeing it through its early growth
phase before it becomes profitable.
FIG believes that these should, as far as
possible, be taken on by the investors.
As Mr. King put it, “so who would you
charge - the rich investor whose got all
the money or the student who is just
trying to keep the idea going?”
FIG went live this September and
is already supporting seven promis-
ing student-led enterprises (it was six
when I first wrote this sentence and
may be more before this paper gets
out).
The most successful so far is
SpineStrength, founded by Doug Hig-
gins, a former rugby captain here at
Imperial.
His product is an ingenious piece of

gym equipment that allows develop-
ment of neck and lower back muscles,
which are needed during scrummag-
ing. He came up with the idea as a
mechanical engineering student, when
he injured himself and found nothing
in the gym to help his rehabilitation.
What started as an undergraduate de-
sign project has now been taken on by
gyms and sports coaches across the
country as way to allow athletes to re-
duce training-related injuries.
FIG is growing fast. Mr King has an
open mind about whether they will
cover student enterprise abroad be-
fore other types of start-up at home.
Given the intricate understanding of
the company of the unique challenges
faced by student entrepreneurs, this
seems likely. Less than a month after
beginning to get the word out, they
have already been approached by com-
panies from across Europe, the USA
and the Middle East.
FIG clearly has huge potential, but
this does not always translate to tangi-
ble results. Doug Higgins has come to
know their value as well as their limi-
tations better than anyone. “Without
FIG I would not have raised the money.
No question about it; just would not
have happened. James got me talking
to all the people I needed to talk to
and now here we are.” I suspect he may
well have got the money anyway, but
it sounds like FIG made the process
much smoother.

Issues surrounding intellectual prop-
erty also cause some aspiring entrepre-
neurs to delay starting their company.
It is important to remember that ideas
cannot go anywhere if they are never
shared with anyone. “Ideas are two a
penny. It’s not the idea that is worth
money, it’s all the thinking around
it,” advises Mr King. It is important
to discuss concepts with experienced
professionals, likely consumers, and
others who can help before basing a
business on them.
There is also a warning about IP law
firms. FIG works with IP21 because
they have provided them with a con-
sistent service and because the firm
caps its own fees. Many law firms will

ed contracts were they continually ask

are discussed.”
I ended the interview by asking Doug
how he would advocate FIG to entre-
preneurial friends back at Imperial.
“Look at their success. I think you just
have to look at what they have done.
That is their biggest selling point.”
The company has already acquired
office space in Marylebone to offer
for free to its entrepreneurs. They also
plan to roll out other benefits such as
free gym membership cards by Christ-
mas. They may be expected to set up
a foundation for that, to benefit from
charitable status. But yet again Mr
King showed his excellent eye for busi-
ness opportunities by pointing out
“there are benefits to running this as
part of our company, like sponsorship
and other partnership opportunities.”
He may well be able to profit from giv-
ing people things for free.
FIG is growing fast in part because
they are open to different ways of
improving. Unlike any venture capi-
tal firms that you are likely to come
across, they welcome suggestions from
all quarters. As their target clients, stu-
dents are encouraged to contact them
directly if they have any ideas about
how they can continue to develop and
improve as a company.
As former Imperial students, both
Doug Higgins’ and James King’s sto-
ries should inspire anyone here who
has good ideas floating around their
mind alongside doubts as to wheth-
er they can really put in all the hard
work. There is no down side to getting
started. Since FIG’s business model is
geared towards sharing the profits of
success rather than providing expen-
sive services to likely failures, they will
give an honest, impartial and objective
account of how good your idea is. You
never know; Doug was probably not
always sure that he would be running a
million pound company today.
