Which odd Imperial
stereotype have you
noticed about?
FELIX DULY NOTES THAT IMPERIAL HAS ITS STEREOTYPES.
LET’S SEE IF ANYONE’S ACTUALLY SEEN ANY......
Your drunk mate
photo of the week
xkcd.com
This guy is pictured during pre-season rugby training. Not only does he
have his hands taped together, he’s also cheekily winking at you too.
Edward Ciderhands anyone?
Got a picture of your mate being an
absolute waste of oxygen? Email your
photos to catnip.felix@imperial.ac.uk

WHERE’S THE WEIRDEST PLACE
YOU’VE HAD SEX? (Contact details above!)
The classic! The library geeks that
enter College only in the darker hours
of the day. They get to their computer
just as you’re finishing off your latest
lab report in for that morning......then
start coding the fuck away like there’s
no tomorrow. DANCE FINGERS
DANCE!

There’s always awkward Physics
lads about. They wander about the
Blackett Laboratory looking a bit
lost. They’re not lost, they’re just
pondering over the latest equation
that may or may not matter to
anything or everything.
Physicist but not awkward
There’s this fresher about the Union
always so fucking loud and trying
to impress everyone. FUCK OFF
WHOEVER YOU ARE.

World of Warcraft anyone? Yeh
fucking right. Play World of Shitcraft
once again in the library whilst I
need a computer to print off my
dissertation for a deadline 10 minutes
away, and I will honestly take my
laptop to your face, and slam it a la
Vinnie Jones in Lock Stock

Mates in the Maths library all playing
your shitty online warrior game or
whatever you play. It’s like a fucking
wave of mouse clicks as you enter
the room. Spotify on uni accounts,
nothing else.

Hockey ladettes everywhere on
Wednesday night. Never seen a girl
drink so much. Then again, never
seen a girl vomit that much. Hockey
ladies forever!

Rugby lads. WAHEEEEEEEEY.
Rugby
Oh fine don’t hold open the door for
me. Oh fine blank me and pretend
you never saw me despite being in
your lab group for the whole year.
Oh ok be a dick to me when I ask
to borrow a pencil which isn’t even
yours.
Chemist
The too cool for school ones that
never hang out with anyone from
Imperial. Go to street parties in
Brixton and stuff. Wear stupid
outrageous ‘cool’ clothes.
Obviously not cool
AMERICANS AT THE UNION.
HOW GREAT ARE THEY?
SERIOUSLY, THEY TALK TO YOU
AND ARE NORMAL!
