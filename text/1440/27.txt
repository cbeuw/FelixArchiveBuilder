L
ead singer Jack Steadman on
stage is possibly one of the
most intriguing musical sights
on offer this side of the Millen-
inium. He takes that clichéd image of
a shy, semi-autistic musician who finds
confidence in his music, and turns it
on its head. Between songs he swag-
gers around the stage, guitar hanging
casually off his shoulders but during
the songs, it all disappears and he truly
becomes a sight to behold.
A manic smile remains firmly glued
to his face as his voice slides and
breaks. When his right hand leaves
the guitar, it slowly rises up to his face
before his barely contained excitement
comes crashing down with his hand
onto the strings. He frequently forgets
to return to the microphone in be-
tween gleefully riffing on his guitar in
front of the drummer and visibly aches
to escape the microphone at the end of
every sentence.
His disagreement with the micro-
phone could be interpreted as a pho-
bia but it comes off as simple, sheer
ecstasy.
Aside from the sheer awesomeness
of Jack Steadman and Bombay Bicy-
cle Club’s material in general (slight
author bias), there are a few things
that detract from the experience.
Steadman’s strangeness does at times

means that he misses or fudges lines,
depending on how into the rhythm of
the music you are, this is either com-
pletely missed or ruins the song. More
importantly however, 80% of BBC
fans are 5ft 2, 12 year old indie kids
who like to “mosh”. Definitely a bit ir-
ritating, and I definitiely didn’t jump
in with them…

T
he plural still resides tonight
but we are only treated to
a singular affair as a lone
John Darnielle briskly walks
onto the stage. He gives a meek Thai
greeting as thanks for the ovation he
receives. Suited and gangly, with sub-
dued confidence, his humble stage
presence is warming as he directly en-
gages the crowd.
Evidently an incredibly gifted song-
writer his literate lyrics have earned
a cult following, the large auditorium
nestled by the Thames is mostly full. He
comments on how it is strange to play
such a venue, where the crowd is silent.
A stark contrast to the usual small bars
he would normally frequents on tours
in smaller cities. Becoming more com-
fortable addressing the audience, he
shares a secret to his rapid strumming,
turns out it was more down to polish-
ing his trumpet than playing his guitar.
Starting on the piano for the first
few songs, comparisons to such as
the more serious side of Ben Folds
would not be unfounded but the ma-
jority of the set is performed with
just an acoustic guitar. With the lack
of a backing band, or any further ac-
companiment whatsoever, there was a
distinct lack in musical variation aside

from dynamics and as a result the hour
and a half set began to feel like it was
treating water more than it was swim-
ming. Lyrically his songs fit together
encompassing several series, and are
interesting in their own right, yet a lot
was detracted tonight as musical simi-
larities prevailed as the set continued.

I
bet you’ve already heard DJ
Shadow; he’s a stern favourite of
advertising execs and BBC sound
editors. As soon as you’re famil-
iar with his stuff, he’ll haunt you like a
ghost. Next time you see Jeremy Clark-
son rev a brand new Italian sports car
or O2 brag about their latest deals in
a cutting edge ad, don’t be surprised if
you hear the glitched drums or ethe-
real synths of DJ Shadow’s 1996 debut
album. It’s famed for being the first al-
bum to consist entirely of samples; it’s
even in the Guinness book of world
records.
Sampling, for the uninitiated, is es-
sentially cutting up chunks of other
people’s recordings and transfiguring
them into your own musical ideas, and
to a lot of people that sounds like cheat-
ing, the Verve, for instance, have to pay
100% of their royalties for Bitter Sweet
Symphony to Mick and Keith because
of some strings that are sampled from a
cover of a Rolling Stones song.
However this album stands as in-
dubitable proof that sampling is just
as valid as regular writing styles, no
matter what money hungry, coked
up, rock stars think. Shadow mixes
samples from an unholy range of
sources including: Mettallica, A Tribe
Called Quest, Bjork, the Blade Runner
Soundtrack and countless numbers of
obscure bargain bin records to create
a sound which is completely alien to
all its sources. Expertly cut up hip hop
beats accompany a schizophrenic or-
gan, doom metal drones add darkness
to Rick James funk resulting in amaz-
ingly intricate soundscapes that are so
removed from regular music they can,
in fact, soundtrack virtually anything.
Albums that you should know
Shadows warped taste combined
with his virtuosic DJ skill made this
album the benchmark for experimen-
tal music in the mid 90’s notably influ-
encing the likes of Radiohead, J Dilla
and Danger Mouse. Unfortunately
Shadow never regained this kind of
form with the exception perhaps of
the UNKLE collaboration ‘Psyence
Fiction’. Notable in his demise was
2006’s ‘the Outsider’ which featured
an ill-advised foray into crunk and a
Kasabian collaboration. How 10 years
can change a man.
