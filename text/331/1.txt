Not only
but also
Cockroaches and
mice in refectories
"We must not be complacent, but at least
the situation is not as bad as it is in many
parts of Kensington". That is how Dr. Levy,
Chairman of the Refectory Committee, sum-
med up the situation regarding the infestation
of the kitchens by mice at Thursday's Refec-
tory Committee meeting.
The meeting was told that it would be necessary
to spend £3,350 to disinfect the refectory areas of
cockroaches and mice. This sum included £1.250 for
steam cleaning and £1,000
for washing down walls.
The committee, which
last year contemplated the
then cost of £2,500 as
above their ceiling, is now
prepared to pay this and
get the kitchens properly
cleaned.
Cockroaches are appar-
ently fairly easy to get
rid of, but tend to become
resistant to t h e poisons
used fairly rapidly, so they
have to be changed at
frequent intervals. Appar-
ently M r . Mooney and his
staff are already achieving
some considerable success
in combating cockroaches.
A bigger problem arises
with mice. There are no
poisons which can be used
where food is prepared,
the meeting was informed.
Without mentioning the
possibility of the college
investing i n a few hundred
cats. D r . Levy drew the
meeting's attention to the
widespread mouse prob-
lem in Kensington. A t the
moment, by comparison
with other places, f C is
hardly affected, but the
situation will have to be
watched carefully. Other
areas of the college are
equally infested, if not to
a worse extent, including
halls of residence.

The finance sub-com-
mittee reported that al-
though turnover this year
was projected to be almost
double that of last at
£307,000, the refectories
were likely to incur a loss
of the order of £9,000. It
was agreed that £6,500 of
this could be met from re-
serves, and the remainder
from profits on wine sales,
which this year should
amount to about £4,000.
Bar profits, estimated at
approximately £10,000, are
to be spent on completely
refurbishing S o u t h s i d e
Bar.
If current trends con-
tinue, no price increases
will be necessary before
the end of the financial
year, o n 31st July. It will
then almost certainly be
necessary to raise prices
since wages are expected
to rise steeply in the i n -
terim.
V . A . T . A B S O R B E D
The "college bars are to
absorb V . A . T . until the
end of July, when the
situation can be assessed.
It is certain that V . A . T .
will be levied once this
period is over. The only
problem with bars at the
moment is that not enough
Watney's Beer is being
drunk: the bars are on an
agreement to down 400
barrels a year i n order
to reap the benefits of an
improvements loan.

Portrait of a
Catering Manager
So Victor paid one of his little visits to a Union meeting for a tete
a tete with the boys and girls. It's not the first time it's happened and it
won't be the last.
Mooney's been a source of abuse ever since he arrived at IC many
years ago and a sort of legend has evolved around this man who has
done more than anything to add a bit of colour to the lives of all who
have trodden the journey of a lifetime through the technological pathos
of IC and the hallowed, mal-coloured pathways to Moonev's culinary
delights—more than anything to add a bit of colour to the very media
you are now investigating.
In my short overstay at IC Felix has been embossed with real life
photies of
—the famous "Mooney hairy chip—hairier, more grotesque, than
you have ever seen before, looks not unlike a spider with an enormous
wooden leg or some such organ (improvise, Mike)".
—the magnificent "Mooney cockroach—bigger and better and more
life-like than ever your wildest nightmares imagined. See how it leaps into
a boiling vat of southside rice.'
—the patented "Mooney scurvy scare—now the driving force behind
such superb literary genius as Camus' 'The Outsider', Green's 'The Man
Within', Mary McCarthy's 'A charmed life', Sartre's 'Intimacy', Coulson
and Richardsons' 'Chemical engineering. Vol 3', Bertrand Russet's
'Why 'I am not a Christian' and Robin Farquharzon's 'Drop Out', Life in
London beneath the poverty line (It was the grant, doctor. I was forced
to go there.)".
Mooney's had all this. Often it was the only thing capable of stirring
IC's senescent students from their slide rules and Coulson and Richard-
son, Vol 3. Every society needs a scapegoat and Mooney's been IC's
since records began. Not that he's suffered from the experience. He's
developed a fine art in fending off questions like some dispassionate
observer. Listening to his Union meeting offerings it seemed hardly
credible that he has any responsibilities towards IC catering at all.
But the questions have improved too. Rob. Armitage pestered him
enough to be ICU's next secretary. (Did you like those phosphorescent
maroon and purple posters for Allnut and Armitage? Just watch about
800 turn up for the ents concerts on the 5th and 6th. Who are dis band,
man?)
Then up pops Mike Doherty (Yes, there is a Mike Dock and he is
someone else and you may have seen us . . . both of us . . . launching
a joint attack of sorts in the soccer 6's on Sunday).
"What about the higher standard at the R C A ? " asks Mike.
"Oh. Yes. There's always been this one. If it isn't RCA, it's R C M
or some such like." But some such like isn't IC, Victor. You never see
notices like ' R C A students must not eat in this refectory before 1 pm'
in our Naafis. And how can you justify RCA being better because it's
smaller? The only comparable refec at IC is the Union, you sav, in
terms of numbers, and you're trying to close that because it's "not
viable". But RCA's viable. But no doubt they've got a different scape-
goat.

UNION
MEETING
ANGRY
AT
EVASIVE
MOONEY
Mr. Mooney, College
Catering Manager, and
Dr. Levy, Chairman of the
Refectory Committee,
came to the Union Meet-
ing on Thursday to state
their case and answer
questions from the meet-
ing. Dr. Levy started the
meeting by outlining the
financial position of the
refectories this year as a
comparison with last, and
questions were then
thrown up from the floor.
The main grumbles were
with prices, only a few
with quality. The meeting
seemed to be com inced
that prices had been put
up, and M r . Mooney's ev-
asive answers did nothing
to alleviate their fears. H e
claimed no knowledge of
price disparities between
refectories, and said
that they all operated to
a standard duplicated list
which had been current
since the Ist August.
When told last week (un-
til it was taken down)
there was a new price list
against the old one with
price differentials he again
claimed ignorance.
H e claimed that price
disparities occurred only
when cashiers got mud-
dled, and that price " i n -
creases" which occurred
this way should be report-
ed to h i m . H e told the
meeting that students must
be their own watchdogs on
prices and overcharging.
When charged that his
quality and value for mon-
ey was poor by compari-
son with the Royal College
of A r t , he attempted to
shrug this off by simply
stating that they were
smaller. While they dealt
with about three or four
hundred dinners at lunch-
time, College Block or
Southside each had about
1200 customers.
M r . Mooney's general
aim seemed to be to pass
on the blame and responsi-
bility to others. Price " i n -
creases" are the fault of
cashiers overcharging, the
continuance of the habit
is the fault of students not
complaining, and the fault
for the bad quality of the
food lies with the refector-
tories having too many
customers.
