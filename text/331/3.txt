Anger over UGM Farce
" F a r c i c a l " was the reaction of leading Union poli-
ticians to the conduct of last Thursday's U n i o n Gen-
eral Meeting.
The problems arose out of inquoracy just after
three o'clock, immediately prior to the vote on the
Grants motion, upon which 25 minutes' discussion had
already taken place. T h e motion laid down plans for
tomorrow week's 'National D a y of Action'.
On a count following
the quorum challenge
there was found to be 244
members present, 56 short
of the quorum. Instead of
closing the meeting, Paul
Jowitt (Deputy President)
who was in the chair, ad-
journed it for five minutes
to give members time to
go and collect another
sixty or so people to make
up the quorum.
It was obvious that on
reopening the meeting it
would be inquorate. A
petition carrying the re-
quired 130 signatures was
presented to M r . Jowitt,
demanding an Extraord-
inary General Meeting.
M r . Jowitt accepted the
petition, and made the
surprising move of open-
ing the Extraordinary
Meeting straight away.
The quorum was immedi-
ately challenged, and the
E G M closed.
Members of the group
presenting the petition
told 'Felix' after the meet-
ing that the intention had
been to hold the E G M
this week, and that they
had not anticipated it be-
ing opened at once. They
considered M r . Jowitt's
action puerile.
A t the beginning of the
U G M a request was made
for a change in the
agenda, which would have
tabled the grants motion
and a few other minor
motions before the hust-
ings,, with a view to en-
suring quoracy through-
out the meeting.
It now seems quite lik-
ely that an E G M will be
held on Thursday to dis-
cuss the motion and the
others that have had to be
deferred.
White Paper
Conference
A t the end of December, the Government pro-
duced a n end-of-term report that they hoped might
get overlooked i n the Christmas festivities. I refer to
the educational White Paper, " E d u c a t i o n — A
Framework for Expansion." Their hope was based
on the fact that the future looks pretty gloomy, par-
ticularly for higher education.
Following publication
of the White Paper, the
N U S called a national one
day conference to discuss
it, and this conference was
duly held, here at Imperial
College, on Saturday, Feb-
ruary 24th. One of the lar-
gest one-day conferences

The conference was

the White paper, which
has nothing to do with
" E x p a n s i o n " but indeed

back. Higher Education

Statement of the N.U.S.
Executive after
meeting Mr. Norman
St. John Steves on
Thursday 1st March
A n N U S delegation met M r . St. John Stevas,
to discuss the N U S grants claim. T h e Govern-
ment was neither prepared to meet the N U S
claim nor to refuse it. Y e t the Government was
given the Union's case four months ago.,Through
the actions and decisions of this Government and
its predecessors the standard of living of students
has been systematically eroded and the effect of
outdated grants regulations become more strin-
gent.
The N U S Executive is therefore calling a na-
tional student strike for Wednesday, 14th M a r c h
This will involve the boycott or cancellation of
lectures and the closing down of as many of the
other activities of colleges and universities as
possible. Public demonstrations, leafleting, meet-
ings etc. will be organised. Particular emphasis
will be laid on strengthening contact with a n d
co-operation from the trade union movement,
and college-based trade unions will be asked for
their support.
We accuse the Government of procrastinating
over our just claim; laying the basis for a future
situation i n which only the sons and daughters
of the rich will be able to enter further and higher
education; trying to drive a wedge between stud-
ents and the rest of the population.
