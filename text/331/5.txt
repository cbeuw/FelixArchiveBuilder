Visits the Young Vic
" H O B S O N ' S C H O I C E " by Harold Brighouse
A brisk few minutes walk from Waterloo Station
takes you, past its elder slightly more sophisticated
namesake, to the Y o u n g V i c . A s we enter its small
but inviting portals my fiancee is surprised to find
one of her old primary s c h o o l friends taking the
tickets, but then the Y o u n g V i c is like that, friendly,
informal, and very m u c h alive. The stage is sur-
rounded in a horse shoe fashion by upward sloping
benches and there is room for about 3 0 0 , including
those sitting in the very small gallery. Here one
feels part of the play, friends of the actors and an
integral part of the atmosphere. Here the theatre
is for living not watching.
The day is Saturday, February 24th, and the pro-
d u c t i o n , Brighouse's famous "Hobson's Choice".
For those not familiar with the story of this c o m e d y
set in Salford in 1 8 8 0 , it concerns M r . H . H . Hob-
son, owner of a shoe shop, and his three daughters,
the pretty A l i c e and V i c k e y , and the dominant M a g -
gie, w h o serves in the shop. A t the age of 3 0
M a g g i e is considered past marriage but she has her
eye on the very meek, master boot-maker, W i l l i e
M o s s o p , who works in the shop a n d who, although
p r o m i s e d to his landlady's daughter, one A d a Fig-
gins, is soon " u n - p r o m i s e d " by the resourceful
M a g g i e . M r . H o b s o n , fond of his frequent visits to
the " M o o n r a k e r I n n " is unable to prevent the subse-
quent marriage and in drowning his sorrows falls
d o w n an open cellar hole into Beanstock's store
house. Y o u n g lawyer, Albert Prosser, is engaged by
M a g g i e to sue Henry Hobson for trespass on behalf
of Beenstock's a n d in settling " o u t of c o u r t " Henry
finds he loses £500 and his other two daughters to
Albert Prosser and Freddy Beanstock, w h i l e Maggie
a n d W i l l i e have set up their o w n shoe shop in their
basement flat. H o b s o n ' s trade d w i n d l e s a n d when
Henry is told by Doctor M a c F a r l a n e that he must
give up alcohol to save his life, Maggie and W i l l i e
m o v e in to help Henry and take over the shop, w h i c h
now becomes " M o s s o p and H o b s o n ' .
The loud, temperamental and a w k w a r d M r . Hob-
son is brilliantly portrayed by Peter Bayliss playing
a role familiar to his more famous one (that of
D e n n i s ' father in " F e n n Street G a n g " ) . A n d r e w
Robertson as the short, funny looking W i l l i e , was
just as c o n v i n c i n g . W i t h stage props kept to a mini-
m u m (a few clogs and boots, cash register, door,
e t c . ) , the art of acting well was actively displayed
before us by a c a s t . a n d atmosphere that fired the
imagination a n d absorbed one completely in the
The Young V i c has taken to the fifties of late, to
the days before The Beatles and Harold W i l s o n put
the spiritual and material gloss on the swinging
sixties. The w o r l d revealed is as distant as Pompeii.
The girls wear suspenders and girdles and one tiny
slip leads to tragic consequences. The men wear
straight trousers, shirts that need ironing and still
take the likes of J . B. Priestley seriously. Hair is
short, the m i d d l e classes get what's c o m i n g to them,
men are angry and young and the w o m a n ' s place is
by the kitchen sink. The whole thing is in fact damn
nigh unbelievable, except when you remember that
these are essentially differences in manners. Mater-
ial considerations, to judge by the appalling housing
conditions w h i c h are still reality for most of us,
have not changed so m u c h , and now the gloss is
wearing thin too. The Labour Party is a bad joke,
the Beatles have gone and Georgie no longer dazzles
us on the w i n g . University students, the pride of
the Welfare State, are poor a n d graduates are u n -
employed. The m u s i c has not died quickly, but
drifted away, like Glenn M i l l e r in his aeroplane,
and no-one quite knows where it's gone. These
plays show us the w o r l d before it came.
I've seen two of them, A Taste of Honey, by She-
lagh Delaney, first produced in 1958, a n d Look Back
in Anger, by the Angry Y o u n g M a n himself, John
Osborne, w h i c h dates I think from 1 9 5 6 . A s might
be clear from the above, I wasn't really interested
in them as immortal drama — they're not — but
in the way in w h i c h they reflect social values and
change, and on that level I highly recommend both.
The plots and situations were a bit contrived — do
prostitutes really go around with their daughters
like that? asked my companion at A Taste of Honey
— b u t the characters generally made up for it. Julia
M c C a r t h y , w h o plays the daughter, w a s a fantastic-
ally seductive schoolgirl, appealing to all sorts of
play. It was supremely funny, often highlighted by
those small actions and expressions that symbolise
the difference between playing and living a part.
During the intervals one chats w i t h those around
you, makes new friends, or buys a coffee or ice
cream.
W i t h the Y o u n g V i c so close to I.C. by tube, for
4 0 p you can only give yourself a very pleasant sur-
prise one evening. A s W i l l i e M o s s o p said looking
about the shop he now half-owned, in his brand
new suit, at the end of the play, " W e l l , by g u m ! "

fetishes in her gym-slip a n d bobby-socks, a n d her
mother wasn't bad either. " A s 'e got long legs? A h
luv 'em w i ' long legs", she enquires of her daugh-
ter's dastardly sailor-boy, and she is still attractive
enough for her o w n fancy-man to cry out joyfully
after a furtive feel — " C h r i s t , you're not wearing
your g i r d l e ! "
It makes you feel so young, and the old seem so
innocent. The characters are for the most part totally
unaware of themselves, a n d hence of any alterna-
tives to w h a t they are. Peter, the chauvinist male
porker in Taste is a stereotyped, unthinking tyrant,
complete w i t h eye-patch, cigar, whisky-bottle a n d
an acute sense of Who has the money around here
— i.e. h i m . J i m m y Porter in Look Back is an equally
predictable intellectual, w i t h his red-brick back-
g r o u n d — he thinks like a red brick — his h u m a n -
itarian outbursts by George Orwell out of D. H .
Lawrence, his " q u a l i t y " Sunday papers, w h i c h he
takes seriously, and the soft centre w h i c h makes
him settle for a " M e T e d d y — You S q u i r r e l " exist-
ence w i t h his legitimate girl-friend after a l l . A s for
the w o m e n , they wear sexy underwear, iron shirts,
make tea and worry. They are v u l n e r a b l e — p r e g -
nancy hits them hard in both plays — a n d they are
dependent. Sometimes they are beautiful too, like
Julia M c C a r t h y ' s fantastically seductive schoolgirl
in Taste, and sometimes they even start to think
about getting turned on, like the actress in Look
Back, but even she retreats back into her well-
groomed, c h u r c h - g o i n g — h o w many actresses still
go to c h u r c h ? — l i t t l e w o r l d at the end, and there
are only the merest hints of the c o m i n g awareness
of w o m e n and of the release of their human capa-
cities.
In fact, it is precisely this awareness that makes
the total effect of the sixties seem more spiral than
c y c l i c . People are by now more c o n s c i o u s of d o m -
ination patterns, of the importance of e c o n o m i c
independence, and of alternative modes of exist-
ence than they were in the fifties, a n d the disappear-
ance of Harold W i l s o n ' s coat of varnish cannot
interfere with this vital change. W e still have our
smiling morons, of course, but we also have a far
more developed perception of society, and w h i l e
this does not in itself change anything, nothing is
likely to be changed without it. A n y w a y , go a n d see
these plays. If nothing else you might become more
conscious of your o w n consciousness.

which touch on everything from the
Third World to Women's L i b , abortion
to credit cards.
The Commonwealth Calypso (dedi-
cated to Enoch) takes a wry look at
immigration. A conversation in a sta-
tionary railway carriage shows the class
war fought by both sides with equal
enthusiasm and determination. F a m i l y
life, drugs, urban violence (including
Northern Ireland), pollution, inflation
("It's not that we want much, we just
want more"), the G N P and the com-
mercialisation of religion — they are all
dealt with in one way or another.
G B spotlights the prejudice and hypo-
crisy in the older generation (and in
some of ours too!). It views irreverently
the exponents of the "civilised society"
who appear to know how we should all
live — and die. It challenges many of
the preconceptions and the materialism
on which our society is based.
Kathleen Johnson's versatile musical
score ranges through folk and rock, bal-
lad and music hall. The 20 songs are
arranged by David Palmer, who last
week directed the recording of a single
for rush release. Palmer has his own
musical coming to London shortly.
The multi-talented cast of 11 includes
the French mime artist Michel Orphelin
and singer Gladstone Adderley, who
arrived from the Bahamas three weeks
ago. Penny Croft, daughter of the creator
of "Dad's A r m y " , makes her West End
debut.
Henry Cass directs his fifteenth pro-
duction at the Westminster: "Many-
people think there should be an answers.
M a n y people think there are no answers.
This is where I think the Westminster is
a tremendous help in our particular soci-
ety. It tries and very often shows a way
of positive and definite action. A theatre
has a responsibility to the public. The
Westminster Theatre accepts this res-
ponsibility".

G i n and bitters? So far the authors have
successfully evaded attempts to extract a
straight answer. " G B is what you make
it", they say helpfully. N o doubt all will
be revealed to-day (Budget Day), when
this topical musical revue opens at the
Westminster Theatre.
G B has been written by a team: A l a n
Thornhill, Michael Henderson and
Hugh Williams (book and lyrics), and
Kathleen Johnson (music). Together they
take an honest, humorous and satirical
look at our society.
Satire, according to the Concise Ox-
ford Dictionary, is the "Use of ridicule,
irony, sarcasm, etc., in speech or writ-
ing, for the ostensible purpose of expos-
ing and discouraging vice or folly".(!)
The authors hope with G B to bring a
fresh approach to a medium they feel
has been too long the monopoly of
cynics. " M u c h of the satire of the '60s
was aimed at ridiculing ancient virtues
rather than modern vices", says Hugh
Williams. " A s a result much of what was
vicious or ridiculous in the contemporary
scene was left unchallenged because it
was not fashionable to question it. Satire
in the '70s needs to be both more honest
and more forward looking. People are
asking 'who are we, where are we going;
what are we meant to become?'"'
G B will be controversial. Watching
rehearsals this week I saw some of the
40 songs, sketches, mimes and dances
