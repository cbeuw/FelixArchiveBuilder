FEEIX FINANCIA££Y
In a world where
Dishonesty is
the best policy.. -
The word 'broker' is one of those evocative terms
which conjures up, in our minds anyway, a series
of rather menacing images. It sems to smack of
wheeling and dealing by shadowy contact men at
a high rate of interest: we think of stockbrokers
and their belts, bowler hats and plump pink fingers:
and there is Bismarck's 'honest broker' which he,
somehow, turned into a phrase meaning just the
opposite. And then there are pawnbrokers, who
seem to give another down-turn to the picture w e
have of all brokers.
All of which crossed our mind when talking
to FELIX FINANCIALLY's adviser, Derek E. Cum-
mings. He, as readers of this column will know,
is a broker. As readers of this column will also
know, he has been pretty good at putting other
people under the microscope in past issues and in
making such as mortgage company managers, bank
managers and the like explain what they are about.
So it seemed a reasonable idea to cross-examine
him for a change and get his views on what his job
out to be about.
It has to be admitted, of course, that Cummings
does not exactly fit the images we talked about
above, since he is one of the mavericks of the
business herd—the kind of bloke who calls a spade
a bloody shovel.
Anyway, we sat him down and fired off a few
questions. It went like this:—
FELIX: W h a t is a broker?
DEC: B a s i c a l l y , a go-between. A m a n whose job
it is to a c t as the connection between a
problem a n d its best solution. In terms of
insurance, the broker should examine what
the need is a n d obtain the best possible i n -
surance cover at the cheapest possible rate,
Whether the problem is the insuring of a
ship's hull or a housemaid's knee. There's
always a good, efficient w a y of doing i t —
and many inefficient, expensive, wasteful
w a y s of doing it. A good broker will find
the best way.
FELIX: S o a broker is really a kind of middle m a n ?
D E C : Let's make no bones about it. A broker is
a parasite on the body of a vast a n d impor-
tant industry. B u t having said that let's re-
member that parasites have their uses. In
practical terms, a g o o d broker c a n save y o u
a lot of money. A n d I'm not talking, neces-
sarily about a businessman w h o wants to
insure his factory. I'm talking about people
like yourselves — students. A g o o d broker
can save y o u money — perhaps by doing
nothing. I've spoken before about being very
wary of b u y i n g insurance from the salesman
Who c o m e round here trying to flog policies
to people w h o don't need them. W e l l , a
g o o d broker might w e l l advise y o u not to
buy anything because you don't need it.
FELIX: F r o m the experience of many students, there
•do not seem to be many in the insurance
business Who think like that.
DEC: That's quite true. M o s t brokers — a n d I
do mean most — are perfectly content to
earn their bread by selling policies w h i c h
are advantageous to the insurance company
and to themselves without giving as m u c h
as a d a m n about the client.
FELIX: H o w are brokers paid?
D E C : They are paid a percentage, either of the
premiums on the policies they sell, or on
the silm assured.
FELIX: T h e more they sell, the more they get?
D E C : Of course. A n d that's w h y a great many
brokers are quite unscrupulous. It really
makes me m a d ta see h o w easy it is for
a lazy broker to sell insurance. After a l l ,
insurance is a hazy sort of thing a n d the
majority of people w h o b u y it — a n d that's
most people — have very little idea w h a t
they want or what they need. It's like sell-
ing sweets 'to children. Y o u c a n get away
with almost any o l d rubbish, a n d I might
say that most insurance companies do just
that. They actually depend on the public not
k n o w i n g one policy from another. They
make very fatprofits from public ignorance
and the pity of it is that a lot of people in
my profession simply a i d a n d abet them in
doing so.
FELIX: Can y o u give an example?
D E C : Easily. Let's assume y o u feel y o u need
life assurance, a n d that you bowl along to
a broker to fix it up for y o u . Alright, what
w i l l the lazy broker d o ? H e ' l l introduce y o u
to an insurance company and together they'll
sell y o u a n endowment policy, w h i c h is the
policy where y o u pay for, say, twenty-five
years. If y o u kick the bucket, they'll pay
your beneficiary a n d you couldn't care less
anyway. If y o u live they'll promise to pay
you back a lot more than y o u have actually
contributed. S o u n d s fine. But there are two
factors to b e mindful of. O n e , that what
individual companies w i l l pay y o u can vary
half as m u c h again of the total premiums
to twice as m u c h . It depends on w h i c h
insurance company y o u pick. Secondly, a l l
the glossy talk about big returns at the e n d
of twenty-five years has to be set against
the real fact that i t 'is taking the country
only about ten years to halve the purchas-
ing power of your money. In other w o r d s ,
even the very best return on an endowment
is a very poor a n d inefficient form of using
your cash. N o w , no insurance company in
the w o r l d w i l l ever tell y o u that. A n d neither
w i l l the lazy, greedy broker. But I'm a bro-
ker. A n d I say it as often as I c a n .
FELIX: S o far, it seems clear that brokers simply
a d d to the cost of insurance. W o u l d n ' t w e
all be better off without them?
D E C : A good question, but the implication is not
quite accurate. If a l l brokers were abolished,
insurance companies w o u l d s i m p l y have to
employ armies of salesmen to take their
places. Life assurance has to be s o l d . A l -
most all other forms of insurance are
bought, but w i t h life cover, the public has
to be conditioned into buying it. That's w h y
it is so w i d e open to advertising methods
w h i c h border on the dishonest. N o , I don't
think brokers a d d to the cost of insurance.
It's just that many of them go along with
the insurance companies a n d their mislead-
ing advertising a n d c o n people into paying
more than they need to for things they don't
really want.
FELIX: O K , what about the g o o d broker. What does
he d o ?
D E C : A g o o d broker will first look into his client's
affairs a n d see what need he has of i n -
surance — if any. If there is a need, he will
shop around the companies w i t h w h o m he
has contact a n d he will find the best cover
at the cheapest rate. Remember, insurance
is a positive a n d necessary factor in many
situations. Life cover for the m a n with a
family, for example, provides protection for
his dependants in the event of his death.
That's good. But there are numerous w a y s
of going about it.
FELIX: But is it likely that a broker will risk re-
d u c i n g his rake-off w h e n , after a l l , the
client isn't likely to c o m p l a i n since he w i l l
have little idea of the alternatives.
D E C : It's not likely that the greedy broker w i l l
take any such risk. But then, he is a short-
sighted bloke anyway. O n the other hand,
m y o w n philosophy is that if y o u give a m a n
good advice a n d a good deal at the out-
set, he'll very likely c o m e back to y o u w h e n
he really needs y o u . I've got clients n o w
I first met here at IC. S o m e of them I
advised to go away a n d forget about insur-
ance. They didn't need it — and they d i d n ' t
need me, at the time. But w h e n they d i d
have a need, they came back to m e
and I w a s highly pleased. I'd established a
trust, a n d that is a broker's most valuable
asset, in m y view.
FELIX: Why, w o u l d you say, do people need a brok-
er's advice?
D E C : Because there is a very good chance that
it w i l l save them money in the long r u n .
After a l l , y o u don't pay the broker. T h e
insurance company does that if a n d w h e n
business is done. Furthermore, a broker c a n
thread his w a y through the jungle of i n -
surance whereas the ordinary m a n c o u l d n ' t
hope to. There are upwards of 1 5 0 insurance
companies on the market for a start. It's
quite likely that any individual's needs are
best served by using several different c o m -
panies. After all, no one company c a n hope
to offer the best deal for every single insur-
ance situation. O n e might be good for life
cover, another best at for c a r cover, a n -
other for house content insurance. They
tend to specialise. S o to put all your busi-
ness with one company c o u l d w e l be waste-
ful a n d costly. But an experienced broker
will know Which is best for what a n d w i l l
advise accordingly.
F E L I X : It seems likely, then, that some insurance
companies w o u l d have no great love for
brokers — especially those w h o advise their
clients to buy the cheapest policies.
D E C : That's not entirely true. Insurance c o m p a n -
ies want to sell policies, full point. O f
course, there are some w h o employ thous-
ands of salesmen a n d collectors rather than
rely on brokers. T h i s is simply because no
self-respecting broker w o u l d dream of using
them. They give the public a rotten deal
— a n d they k n o w it. C o m p a n i e s like that
are prime examples of trading on public
ignorance. They're bandits. A n d they are
a m o n g the richest insurance companies in
the land.
FELIX: Y o u ' v e spoken a lot about life assurance.
That is, w e know, the most important aspect
of the business. But what about other things.
Is brokerage advice imporant there?
D E C : I think so. There are just as many traps a n d
pitfalls in other kinds of insurance as there
are in life cover.
FELIX: For instance?
D E C : Alright, suppose y o u get married a n d y o u
buy your spouse a d i a m o n d ring. It's worth
two hundred q u i d , but y o u insure it for only
a hundred to save a few shillings on the
p r e m i u m . It gets stolen a n d y o u ring your
insurance c o m p a n y a n d tell them your t w o
hundred p o u n d ring h a s been n i c k e d . N o w ,
you might think they'd pay out the hundred
you insured it for without argument. Y o u ' d
be wrong. They'll pay y o u only fifty. Their
reasoning is that y o u insured it for only half
its real value a n d thereby forced the c o m -
pany to carry a greater risk than they knew
about — because, it being t w i c e as valu-
able, it w a s more likely to be pinched.
Therefore, they reason if y o u only insured
half the risk, they1
!! only pay half the s u m
insured. It's c o m p l i c a t e d , but there is a kind
of logic in it. N o w , if y o u had been in that
situation, w o u l d n ' t 'it have been worth get-
ting it insured properly, b y using the expert
advice of a broker?
FELIX: It seems to us that the insurance companies
have us all by the balls.
D E C : They will have if y o u let them. M y job is to
protect m y clients from that most u n c o m -
fortable risk.
