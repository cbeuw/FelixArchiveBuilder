Letters from heaven
Sir,
I must confess that I did
not find Alasdhair Camp-
bell's letter very interesting.
This was largely due to his
persistent use of 'big' words,
which, in my state of literal
sub-normality, I found diffi-
cult to understand. Despite
this lamentable handicap, I
gather from reading his let-
ter that he knows even less
about the crux of Christian-
ity than I do about Commun-
ism.
Unfortunately, his apparent
ignorance of Christianity is
only typical of this Univer-
sity. We are, after all, sup-
posed to be scientists and
engineers and, as such, our
common approach to any
topic should be one of 'logi-
cal' analysis of the relevant
facts, but it would be opti-
mistic to believe that one in
ten of us has applied this
procedure to Christianitly.
Considering the magnitude
of Christ's claims, it would
be foolish to dismiss him
without a proper examination.
We must, therefore, begin by
looking at the historical basis
of Christianity. The possibil-
ities open to us are: either
Christ lived or he did not.
An investigation of the
authenticity of the Gospels,
the Epistles, and the records
kept by Tacitus and Jose-
phus, the main historians of
that era, should clear up that
point. Assuming you then
reach the conclusion that I
did, i.e., he did exist, we then
progress to the question, who
was he? Again two choices,
either a man or 'The Son of
God'. If he was a man, then
on top of being a good faith
healer (curing the deaf,
dumb, blind and paralysed)
he was a miracle (sorry —-
it's the only apt word) doc-
tor healing lepers, cripples
and raising the dead. He was
also an ace trickster turning
water to wine (concealed
pipes in the floor?) walking
on the water (a ford, of
course) feeding the five
thousand, what a whopper.
He certainly fooled the Jews,
they were so afraid that they
crucified him (but he was
under drugs, so he did not
mind so much).
The alternative to all this
is that Christ was who he
said he was, i.e. God. This
way the whole bible falls in-
to place and we do not need
to make up any weird ex-
planations. But if he was God
then by ignoring him, as most
do, they are gambling not
only with just their physical
lives but with all eternity.
I, therefore, urge everyone
who reads this letter to make
a thorough investigation of
Christ's life.
Yours praying for your souls,
R. E. SLOT A

Sir,
I am to avoid using the
pages of "Felix" for long
lunge and petty arguments
between two people, many
such arguments can be re-
solved on a personal level.
However I am forced to
write an answer to a letter
by Mr. Alasdhair Campbell,
not only for his information,
but more especially for all
the people whom he may
have misled (intentionally or
not) in the historical facts
about Jesus Christ.
He gave Jesus the status
of a revolutionary, but stated
that his death was "record-
ed in the annals of the era
as that of just another
troublemaker". A wild state-
ment, and a truthless one.
This "annals of the era" is
a vagary, but it must be in-
ferred he speaks of the two
contemporary historians Jos-
ephus, governor of Gallilee
and a Jew, and Tacitus the
Historian of Imperial Rome.
Neither of these refer to
Christ as a troublemaker, nor
to his death as that of a
troublemaker. On the con-
trary Josephus writes:
"It was at this time a man
appeared, if 'man' is the
right word, who had all the
attributes of a man, but
seemed something greater.
His actions, certainly, were
superhuman", and later in
the same journal:
"So they (the Jewish Auth-
orities in Jerusalem) seized
him and crucified him in de-
fiance of all Jewish Tradi-
tions." These words were
written by a Jew not by a
Christian.
The second factual error
was saying "though in his
time he had no effect". I pre-
sume most people are aware
of the self-contradictory nat-
ure of this statement in the
context of the letter. Firstly,
Christ had sufficient effect,
that without ever expressing
political ambitions, but sim-
ply "speaking to them con-
cerning the Kingdom of God"
(Acts 1 v 3) he was cruci-
fied, however the effects did
not end here, in Israel there
was widespread persecution
of Christians before the year
50 A.D. Even the Romans,
the greatest military power
known up to that time, were
afraid of Christians, because
of their revolutionary beliefs,
and unless Christianity had
been having an effect the
Roman power machine could
well have afforded to ignore
it. Greek thinking was turned
upside down in Corinth,
Athens and Thessalonica all
these things taking place
300-350 years before the
date he cited for the "poli-
tical efforts" of Christianity.
The greatest of his histori-
cal mistakes was very illogi-
cally to ignore a great bulk
of evidence to be found in
the Bible, even anti-Christian
historians. could not dare
IGNORE it.
I confess that the argu-
ments used by Mr. Campbell
are old, and have been used
by Christ's enemies through-
out history, argument which
is precipitated from a high
degree of illogic or selective
fact-choosing suggests that
even Christ's enemies see he
is still having an effect on
people.
So let us dispense with
myths and look at facts. If
it is suggested that Christ-
ianity has been used as a
political or materialistic
weapon, we must realise that
this is NOT the Christianity,
the Good-News, which Christ
preached. For example,
Christ's Church is not people
who just pop down the local
Church once a week and then
carry on living a Christless
life for the rest of the week.
Christ's Church is people
who lived for Him, in his
strength. Jesus was not, on
his own admission and oth-
ers, a teacher or philosopher,
but God made tangible for
mankind to understand, and
he never showed much inter-
est in politics.
He came to change lives
and does so when we accept
his death for our sins -and
ask him into our lives as
Lord. Many people are happy
as atheists and feel perfectly
satisfied in life, they feel they
don't need Christ, I certainly
did, but that is only because
we cannot realize the chang-
es in our lives that Christ
can effect, in the words of
Paul:
"The unspiritual man does
not receive the gifts of the
Spirit of God . . . and he is
not able to understand them,
because they are only under-
stood spiritually" (1 Corin-
thians 2:14).
How can we possibly be-
gin to know what Jesus has
to say to us until we all stop
ignoring the issue and face
the facts as they are. I pray
that all readers of this letter
including Mr. Campbell will
try to find out these facts,
because they are the TRUE
facts of life.
Yours in Christ,
MAURICE MOLONEY.
Dear Sir,
There has been a growing
concern in recent years with
the problems of drug abuse,
rising crime rates, sexual per-
version, and most recently
depression and suicide which
have permeated all elements
of our society. Many groups
and organisations have
sought the solution to these
problems, but most have ex-
perienced very little in the
way of concrete results.
There is, however, a pro-
gramme which has resulted
in the dramatic transforma-
tion of purposeless, unhappy-
lives into useful, productive,
and happy people. It is
known as "The Children of
God".
The success of this pro-
gramme is the result of
adopting a whole new life
style — one based on love,
sharing, mutual co-operation
and the desire to help one's
fellow man—in an environ-
ment of peace and harmony
where people can grow and
realize their full potential as
human beings.
Many people have criticiz-
ed this group for their revo-
lutionary way of life, but they
cannot refute the fact that it
works. If you would like to
know more about this way of
life and the work that is be-
ing done to help our fellow
men in all parts of the
world I will be very happy
to come to your college and
meet you personally. There
are also several films avail-
able and I am certain that
such a programme would be
of great interest to people
like you who are concerned
with the social problems of
this day and age.
To make arrangements for
a meeting or for further in-
formation, phone me at 01-
464 7769. I look forward to
hearing from you in the near
future.
Yours faithfully,
J. W. WORMUS.

Then someone brought up (sorry) the subject of
chips. You want more, BOY! Well, says Vic. for 5p
in the refecs you get as many as in a bag for 7p
from your nearest chippy. Well, my nearest chippy
has many more than the average Mooney portion
and they aren't hairy and gangrened either and
they're only 5p and that's in W.1 (urban elitist).
Then Doctor Levy, featured as joint top of the
bill—no expense has been spared—says we can
always make suggestions to Mr. Mooney as we
meet him in our meanderings around the campus
(what's a campus, daddy?). But he didn't explain
what sort of suggestions and anyway me usual
meeting place is the underpass by Civ. Eng. as
we approach at right angles on a collision course—
me dreaming along on first lecture and Mooney
speeding towards college block as he commutes
in from Prince's Gardens in his Jag.
But don't worry, Victor. (You don't—Do you?)
You're not such a bad guy, really and . . m m
. . . I'm going to dinner in hall tonight . . . shit.
