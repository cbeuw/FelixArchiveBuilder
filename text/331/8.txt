It is felt that certain misconceptions have arisen
amongst the students regarding the set-up of S C A B .
The purpose of this article is to lay these m i s c o n c e p -
tions.
The idea behind the inauguration of the Board
w a s to crystalize the efforts of its constituent organ-
isations to their mutual advantage a n d for the bene-
fit of the students of Imperial College. Ents, this
year has been an outstanding financial s u c c e s s a n d
a s s u m i n g they continue in this vein in c o m i n g years
then it w a s felt that their excess s h o u l d be used
to benefit the entertainment of smaller minority
groups w i t h i n the college a n d so to provide a more
comprehensive spectrum of entertainment. It w a s
furthermore felt that the financing of these smaller
clubs through bodies s u c h as R C C w a s slightly out
of place w h e n it w a s grouped w i t h what may be
c a l l e d " n o n - c o m p e t i t i v e sports c l u b s " .
M a n y students w h o have been consulted have
expressed concern that clubs like D r a m S o c w o u l d
b e c o m e purely entertainment a n d thus lose their
function a n d value as cultural a n d recreational
clubs. There is provision in the constitution of
S C A B to prevent just this kind of situation occur-
ring and the Board itself w i l l ensure that this does''
not happen.
The Board w i l l also be used, a n d has the facility
to put the co-operation between interested parties
on a formal footing. T h e B o a r d is not allowed to
interfere w i t h the internal running of the constituent
organisations. It is important to note at this point
that the Ents committee has the same standing on
The B o a r d as all the other clubs. Their Junior Treas-
urer w i l l sit on the board, in addition to their
c h a i r m a n , for the very s i m p l e reason that they w i l l
handle the most money.
The Board w i l l be chaired by the S o c i a l Secretary
who w i l l represent the Board on C o u n c i l a n d w i l l
N O T have the same job or function as the present
Ents c h a i r m a n . H i s job w i l l be to supervise the co-
ordination of the organisations on the B o a r d a n d to
supervise the d i v i s i o n of the money w h i c h in the
first instance w i l l be derived from the U n i o n Finance
C o m m i t t e e along with the Senior Treasurer of the
B o a r d . He w i l l not be directly involved in the organ-
isation of events a n d w i l l ensure that the a i m s of
the various societies on the B o a r d are not inter-
fered with directly by the B o a r d .
The c h a i r m a n of the Constituent College U n i o n
Entertainment Committees w i l l sit o n the B o a r d
to a d v i s e a n d to consult, but the C C U ' s w i l l not
derive any financial benefit directly from the B o a r d .
S C A B has been c r i t i c i s e d already a n d w i l l be
c r i t i c i s e d again but hopefully it w i l l improve enter-
tainment facilities a n d c o m m u n i c a t i o n in Imperial
College but it is stressed that it m a y only advise
a n d not interfere directly w i t h its constituent organ-
isations w h i c h i n c l u d e IC Ents Committee. It is not

S p o r t i n g F e l i x : H o c k e y
Last week the 1st X I had two hard games — against
Ashford (Middlesex) o n Saturday and Southampton
U n i o n on Wednesday. After another of their joy-rides
when the coach got lost — because Heineken, who
had the directions, went b y car — we finally took the
field half-an-hour late. After dominating the first five
minutes, I C quickly ran out of steam and let Ashford
in for two goals i n the first half. T h e second half was
fairly even with the only goal being scored by A s h -
ford. However, IC deserved more in this half especially
in one goalmouth melee when Ashford successfully
used everything to stop a goal.
O n Wednesday Southampton gave I C a hard, fast,
but scrappy, game. It ended in a 1-1 draw — C o l i n
Dyer scoring from the edge of the circle, after good
work by J a g Gahir. N o t much can be said about
Wessex's goal except that Sid Boulton had a hand in
it.

After a very close game last Sunday, I C M i x e d
team retained their unbeaten record, but were lucky
to do so. Vets fielded a strong side and were very
confident of victory (cocky b . . . . s). T o counter this
I C produced yet another secret weapon — they had
two Wonder Boys in their side. Vets had the better
of the first quarter of the match and eventually scored
a well taken goal. This stirred I C into action and they
eventually took a 2-1 half time lead, both goals com-
ing from short corners. T h e first was from WB(1) trick-
ier — the goalkeeper was fooled by the pace of the
shot — and the second from a Julie creaker. I C added
a third early i n the second half following a W B ( 1 ) —
WB(2) move which resulted i n W B ( 2 ) scoring. Unfor-
tunately Vets were then allowed to equalise from two
defensive mistakes and could have gone into the lead
from any of the many chances they created. Instead,
it was I C who scored the winner, through WB(2),
late in the game.
The following people were known to be present:—
Richard, B o b , Julie, Jacqui, Junior, Chris, Blossom,
WB(2), Villis, W B ( 1 ) an unnamed umpire.

The result of Saturday's match showed that the age
of miracles is not yet over. There was a certain amount
of confusion before the match caused by the very late
arrival of some of the I C side (will culprits please take
note). When the match eventually started, Ashford
stormed into I C territory and remained there continu-
ally for all the first half.
However, thanks to some inept shooting and inspired
goalkeeping by Jerry Heffer, Ashford d i d not score.
In fact it was I C who scored first with a brilliant
breakaway goal midway through the second half. A
M i k e V i e y r a clearance found Chris Tyler o n the left
wing. T h e ball was then worked across the centre,
leaving Dave Neal with just the goalkeeper to beat,
which he d i d with ease. A l m o s t immediately 1C added
a second when a long clearance was chased through
by Dave Neal. A t the sight of this, the goalkeeper
took fright and kicked the ball into his o w n net.
Though Ashford eventually scored at the very end of
the match, they never looked like obtaining an equal-
iser.
