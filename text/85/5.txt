CARNIVAL
I
The c i t y and Uuild's went quite berserk f o r
their red indian c a r n i v a l , aud through a clouded
memory one r e c a l l s only the outstanding moments
of a moat enjoyable night.
-he eaoarei wiij. be long remembered f o r Mr
M i l l e r s c l a s s i c act. To what extent i t was r e -
hearsed, premeditated or spontaneous has s t i l l
not been decided, but the audience had r a r e l y had
such a treat as t h i s by any goon. The I.C. jazz
band with a few friends kept going u n t i l 7 a.m.,
by which time they had t r i p l i c a t e d t h e i r more
popular numbers.
The system of h i r i n g commissionaires t o guard
the entrances t o the dance h a l l s payed dividends,
making the f l o o r r e l a t i v e l y void of those regulars
who get i n on the strength of beer exchange with
inebriated student doorkeepers.

Hie Smoking Concert was held for and by the R.C.S. Union
in Queenies at the end of last terra .It suffered from an
uncomfortable campronise due to the mixed nature of the
audience.
r.obin Bray and Jim Anderson did their best(or worst) with
songs in the Testern Brothers style relating to the more
sordid aspects of "ondon life.The >iines' President's guest
iten vras a delightful l i t t l e sons «*out the incontinence of
his oanine friends.Mr. Miller who was *lsc t i l l e d most have
lost Iiis nerve as he did not show up.ftjyouj of oheaists
suessfully parodied Dhole Tod Ccbley to Uncle Bugs Guthrie.
AH the songs Were well ueceived but with the slcetches
a 'mah sadder t;;le is to be told, for when they penetrated
the alcohol - laden atmosphere and filially reached the
audience ,they were hurled back with groans towards the
stare.
One item which stands out brightly «oons the itdots of that
evening was the I.C. Jar.n 3».n&»7hey both introduced the shew
«md played during the interval arid were repeatedly cheered
for their fine perfcrmsnce.A small divergence was oa'ised
by sor^e jSuildsnen nlanttns ^ totem pole i n the rooni.
WINE TASTING
Between Christmas and the New Year, the
College Vintnors moved from t h e i r c e l l a r s near
Connon Street Station to a much more extensive
sereies of caves i n Southwark. To a s s i s t i n trans-
ference of stock they asked fifteen, students to
help them f o r three days. Unfortunately these
students worked or drunk so prodigously that
there were no f u l l b o t t l e s l e f t i n the o l d c e l l a r
by the t h i r d day, so i t was pointless f o r them to
stay there any longer.

We apologise f o r the error i n the pythagoram i n
the Christmas issue which made i t i n s o l u b l e . People
who pointed t h i s out are t o be commended, and the
anonymous donor of the correct clue i n addition t o
the correct answer i s to be congratulated.
FELIX wishes t o congratulate one of i t s Editors
Emeriti, Robin Bray, upon his marriage during the
vacation. It w i l l not be the general policy t o
annpunce such events,or engagements during the
current leap year.

MACHINES HIRED WEEKLY OR MONTHLY
Imperial College has produced yet another
l i t t l e booklet f o r the guidence of i t s members;
we have the pleasure i n reviewing the "Wine L i s t "
1955-56. Whether we should c r i t i c i s e t h i s book f o r
i t s l i t e r a r y merits or the wine s e l e c t i o n committee
upon i t s taste i s a moot point, and our wine corres-
pondent has passed the sixteen pages on t o us with
a few observations i n the hope that a more general
representation of the student body would not indulge
i n 'Connoiseurmanship'.
The book i s as l a v i s h l y f i l l e d with maps as the
front page of t h i s e d i t i o n of FELIX (the Wine L i s t
has red p r i n t as w e l l as b l a c k ) . F i f t y one wines and
l i q u e r s are numbered, i n some cases s i m p l i c i t y of
remembering just one number i s hindered by various
vintages being a v a i l a b l e f o r that type, so that the
'O.K.Year' has t o be w r i t t e n on ones cuff as w e l l .
It i s i n t e r e s t i n g to note that the f i r s t
paragraph o f the booklet t e l l s us that burgundy
with oysters would probably give r i s e t o a l l e r g i e s
and the second paragraph advises us that burgundy
i s a good wine t o drink with oysters. Fortunately
t h i s sabotaging of our health i s not undermined
elsewhere nearly so much as the underminine: of our
pockets. The p r i c e s are reasonable f o r what we are
given, being i n general those of the r e t a i l price.
But few wine drinkers on the continent have Chateau
bottled or even Anoel Lation Controle"e wines with t h e i r
meals, since these are f o r very s p e c i a l occasions,
which have t o recur i n I.C. with monotonous regular-
i t y . Besides the actual expense of having these types
of wines, no h a l f bottles are mentioned as being
available mak»<f drinking quite an ambitous event
for only two people.
It has been rumoured that wines w i l l be a v a i l -
able by the caraft when we return to a dining h a l l
with service next October. Perhaps cheaper wines
w i l l be a v a i l a b l e : I t a l i a n wines (not mentioned i n
the list") many people know to be a v a i l a b l e very,
cheaply i n Old Compton Street: French wines from
Lannuedoc and Spanish. Portugese wines are mention-
ed at prices of 5/6 and 6/6. These wines have less
export t a r i f f than French wines.
The layout of the wine l i s t i s commendable,
and the odd items of information are as i n s t r u c t i v e
as the odd quiz. This concerns the Duke of Clarences'
strange fate i n 1473. No answer i s supnlied, so that
discussion may proceed through out the desert.
The wine l i s t on the back cover gives a good
i n d i c a t i o n of the economic s i t u a t i o n in various
parts of Europe f o r the years 1932-5.3,
F i n a l l y , we know now not t o be put off by the
choiee of three wines at i i a l l Dinner when the l i s t
contains 36 table wines. Since some of these need
ordering f o r t y eight hours i n advance, perhans we
w i l l be t o l d what the menu at formal dinners i s at
least f o r t y eight hours i n advance so that we may
order the most annropiate wine. The Vine L i s t can
c e r t a i n l y help students to c u l t i v a t e t a s t e ^ f o r the
College Vintners' products.
