Althougu no organised s e l e c t i o n was used, we
have decided that John Evans was the FELIX
"Sportsman of the Year" f o r 1955. This i s based
upon h i s achievements i n a t h l e t i c s and cross country
running.
John, who i s nearly twenty three, was educated
at Westminster C i t y School. He l i k e d playing soccer,
and wished to f o l l o w i n Stanley Mathews footsteps,
hut he was u s u a l l y i n the reserves a f t e r the selection
of teams had been made. He found he was a better
natural runner than b a l l player, and f o r the l a s t
seven years has taken advantage o f t h i s . He l a f t
school when s i x t e e n , to work with S o i l Mechanics,
Ltd., and studied as a part time student at North-
ampton Engineering College f o r h i s intermediate
examination.
Since he came t o I.C. eighteen months ago, John
has devoted a l o t of time t o touring Europe f o r race
meetings. This has l e d him to j o i n i n g the great rank
of 1st year repeats ( i n C i v i l Engineering). As a
married man, he i s now more concientous and hopes
to do better t h i s June by missing some o f the race
meetings.
PREFERS TRACK RUNNING
At present, John Evans i s t r a i n i n g f o r track
events, the mile being h i s s p e c i a l i t y , though an.i
occasional two miles i s not too t i r i n g . He says
i t i s i n c i d e n t a l that t h i s improves h i s cross
country, i n which he won the U n i v e r s i t y o f London
Championships i n December, and came s i x t h i n h i s
County Championships (Middlesex) l a s t Saturday.
John's track r e s u l t s have not been s t a r t l i n g
v i c t o r i e s , since he races against f a r more devel-
oped a t h l e t e s , but t h i s f i e r c e r competion has
enabled him t o produce times such as 3min 48.2secs.
for 1500 metres at Stockholm, and 4min. 8.2secs.
for the mile against the R.A.F. He was second i n
both these races, but his outstanding major v i c t o r y
was when he won the 1500 metres f o r the B r i t i s h
U n i v e r s i t i e s at San Sebastian l a s t summer. John
a c t u a l l y considers club running to be f a r more
important than i n d i v i d u a l achievement.
Training f o r racing takes two hours each day
(usually lunch hour) f o r s i x days a week. John
spends more time as secretary of the U n i v e r s i t y
Cross Country Club, so that h i s recreations have
to be f i t t e d into odd moments t o s u i t h i s m a r i t a l ,
a t h l e t i c and academic commitments. He i s fond of
f i c t i o n s t o r i e s , which he reads extensively with
no preference f o r any p a r t i c u l a r author, and l i k e s
l i s t e n i n g to choral and piano music.
When asked h i s d i s l i k e s , John could only think
of poached eggs and "The Archers".
His ambitions, to pass his exams t h i s summer,
and to do w e l l i n the A.A.A. Championships t h i s
J u l y , have changed considerably from his Soccer
aspirations seven years ago.

S t i l l handicapped by the absence o f suitable
Union premises, the Dramatic S o c i e t i e s Christmas
production was performed at the Chanticleer
Theatre during the l a s t week of l a s t term. This
small theatre ensured a packed house f o r the three
nights, and the audience were given excellent value
in entertainment.
The College Society normally s e l e c t s a play
which must be a great success or a miserable
f a i l u r e , and t h e i r ambitions were again f u l f i l l e d
in t a c k l i n g "The Ladies not f o r Burning". The
practice of encouraging freshers t o take the
najority of parts was continued, so that seven
players out of the eleven were new to the I.C.
stage. They showed the society to be w e l l endowed
with fresh t a l e n t . The parts were e x c e l l e n t l y cast,
though i t would be u n f a i r but much e a s i e r t o pick
but the few actors who were not quite so w e l l
selected due t o l a t e changes i n the cast.
the a c t i n g of Judy Kornbluth and Les A l l e n
was as excellent as would be expected by those who
had seen them together i n Antigone. Edna Thornton
played her part as mother to a tiresome household
extremely w e l l , and w i l l no doubt f i n d a s i m i l a r
role i n future productions. Dick Saunders gave us
an amusing c a r i c a t u r e of a Chaplian, while George
Hartnup and David G r i f f e n played t h e i r parts w i t h
great amusement t o the audience.
It was possibly the compactness of the theatre
that made the f a c i a l expressions of the actors
more noticeable than i n previous productions\ t h i s
feature being outstanding. The c o l o u r f u l costumes
were s k i l f u l l y chosen to s u i t the various actors.
The d i r e c t o r , Ian Duff, i s to be congratulated
upon another f i n e production, towards which h i s
stage s t a f f contributed considerably i n making
a success of the theatre a t hand i n such short
time at t h e i r disposal f o r preparation.
A SCENE FROM THE LADIES NOT FOR BURNING.
I. C. Union General Meeting
An I.C.Union General Meeting was held i n guilds
on December 8th.THe lengthy business o* approving
the accounts of the Union,the b o o k s t a l l committee
;he a t h l j t i c s clubs committee and the a t h l e t i c s
grounds :ommittee was dispatched e f f i c i e n t l y . A
motion to the e f f e c t that Council should look
into the question of discrepancies i n granys and
do what they could about it,was proposed by Mike
Walpole and seconded by Brian Davies.Mr Walpole
presented his case very f o r c i b l y and c l e a r l y .
The Presidentthen said that Council was opposed
to the motion and,with Keith M i l l e r ' s help,gave
i t s reasons i n c l u d i n g the facts that the Union
was constituted only f o r the s o c i a l , c u l t u r a l and
a t h l e t i c needs of the students,that I.C. should
not be a c t i n g alone i n the matter and that a
s i m i l a r motion asking f o r opposition t o the
e x t r a d i t i o n of I r a q i students had been rejected
a year before.Mr Walpole r e p l i e d that t h i s had
resulted i n a number of students being shot.At
t h i s a voice from the d i r e c t i o n pf the bench-
smashing element at the back remarked"Oh dear".
Council's case was heatedly opposed from the
floor,an amendment t o the e f f e c t that the matter
should be pressed at the l e v e l of the U.L.Pres-
idents' Council m i s f i r e d and the vote came down
heavily i n favour of the motion .
Of the Any Other Business,a gentleman who
wished to wear a black blazer received l i t t l e
sympathy and eat down frustrated and John N i c h o l l
wanted us t o r e j o i n N.U.S.
