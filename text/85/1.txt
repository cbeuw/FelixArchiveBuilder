IMPERIAL COLLEGE
EXPLORATION BOARD DECISIONS
I.C T E A M S FOR THE S U M M I T
Cn 15th. December last term, the Imperial
College Exploration Joard met to consider app-
l i c a t i o n s for grants for various projects, tour
had been submitted, and three of these were off-
i c i a l l y approved and money granted to them accor-
ding to their assessed needs. The fourth application
was returned to the organiseBs f o r a l t e r a t i o n ,
with several suggestions for. making i t e l l b i b l e
for support by the Board.
Two of the expeditions w i l l take place t h i s
summer, while the third which has the greatest
amount of money invested i n i t w i l l take plawe
in 1957. Just under one h a l f of the Exploration
Boards' current f i n a n c i a l resources nasi thus
been committed at the f i r s t meeting f o r project
selection, so that adequate funds remain for
further expeditions. I t i s hoped that the success
of these w i l l help the Board to gain f i n a n c i a l
support from industry, s c i e n t i f i c societia or
philanthropists.

This [rojecC w i l l be
to investigate the area
of the ,snow-cap and to
determine i t s recent
history of advance and
recession.
The weather conditions

by meteferologists, and
the rate of recolonis-
ation of the area might
also be worked upon by
a botanist. surveyor
would go on this t r i p
to map the area, which
has not yet been done
accurately, and a geo-
l o g i s t to report upon
the underlying rocks.
Th< expedition w i l l

This area of the Himalaya's was selected by the
organisers since i t i s monsoon-free d u r i n c the
months of the summer vacation. The centr_il jreu of
this range (which includes the mountain K2) w i l l
provide the f i n a l location, but this cannot be deci-
ded d e f i n i t e l y u n t i l a party leader has been found.
The party w i l l consist of s i x students, each of
whom w i l l have spent at least one year at Imperial
College during 1955-57. 2oon w i l l be l e f t for up
to two students who may enter the College next
October, but four w i l l be among eight to be provis-
i o n a l l y selected at the beginning of February. The
leader w i l l be a mountaineer with Himalayan experience.
There w i l l be intensive training during the two
Easter vacations and the Christmas vacation, and a
three weeks period i n the French Alps this summer,
so that the team may become f a m i l i a r with each other
and mountaineering techniques.
The alms w i l l be to survey an unexplored region
using a Ihototheodolite, and to undertake s c i e n t i f i c
research i n glaciology, geology, and meteorology.
The cost of the expedition has been estimated
at £5,000-2,S,a00of which the Exploration Board w i l l
provide £2,5CO. The remaining money may be obtained
from the Everest Trust, newspaper rights, photo-
graphs, and lectures.
