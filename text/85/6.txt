F E L I X
INVASION
TOUR by DELFT R.F.C.
Last week the t r a d i t i o n a l peace and quiet of
Imperial College was shattered somewhat by the
a r r i v a l of seventeen h i g h - s p i r i t e d rugby-playing
Dutchmen, who had come from the notorious S o c i e t e i t
Phoenix of Delft University. They soon established
f r i e n d l y r e l a t i o n s with the warden by asking him
whether they could climb up the Hostel w a l l s : his
maniacal laughter which greeted t h i s request e v i -
dently impressed the v i s i t o r s , as no mountaineering
was undertaken.
On Tuesday, January 3rd.,Harlington was the
scene of another encounter between I.C. and the
Delftsche Studenten Rugby Club. The enthusiasm of
the Dutchmen playing rugby i s r i v a l l e d only t h e i r
enthusiasm f o r drinking "Genever". However, although
the Delft team fought very hard, they are not ac-
customed to playing against such s k i l f m l opposition
and thet lost by 30 points t o 6. The I.C. three-
quarters gave a f i n e e x h i b i t i o n of passing a»d
running i n which the forwards frequently joined:
one scissors movement between Weale and Kitchener
completely bewildered our opponents. We can be
sure that the Delft players w i l l have learned much
from t h e i r matches with I.C.,King's, and Kingston,
and they possess several talented individuals who
should be able t o blend t h e i r f i f t e e n into a
worthy f i f t e e n .
The Harlington beer made a tepid start to the
evening, but the Harlington whisky restored Anglo-
Dutch reLations, although at one fctage the very
pavilion seemed to be threatened,
i t s contents both survived with
only a few cuts, and Delft were able to attend the
dinner which I.C. had arranged f o r them the follow
ing evening. As one >1r Jannierk said,"Tonight T
';hink we make a great beer-feast". We c e r t a i n l y die
make a great b e r r - f e a s t , and the Dinne included
some amazing speeches from Dutchmen and E n g l i s h -
men a l i k e . An I.C. crest was presented to D e l f t ,
who returned the compliment with a magnificent
tankard i n Delft china. I.C. now have a good
c o l l e c t i o n of Delft china trophies, which i t i s
hoped w i l l be displayed suitably i n the new bar.
On and off the f i e l d , the men or uexiz revealed
themselves as sportsmen of the highest c a l i b r e .
They admired c e r t a i n B r i t i s h i n s t i t u t i o n s - notably
rugger songs, whisky and St.Pauls Cathedral, but
of others, e s p e c i a l l y the weather, they were
r i g h t l y c r i t i c a l . Once again we found t h e i r comoany
most s t i m u l a t i n g , and we can only hope that they
enjoyed themselves as much as we enjoyed enter-
t a i n i n g them.

in preporation for the Christmas raeet.
In appearance GEKendoe i^iust be one of the wildest glenn in
Scotland,bounded on its two sides by magnificent mountain
scenery, and gives some of the best rock and snow climbing
in Britain,
It was unfortunate that winter had not yet come in force to
this part of Scotland,and i t was necessary to climb to about,
2.000 ft before the snow line was reached,However some excellent
sport was 'to be found on the high sui-vnit ridges and also i n
the long gullies streatohing from the corries up to the ridges..
TTere the snow -ma hard packed and in places ice was present
both these conditions necessitating the use of an ice aj^e>
The rocks were heavily iced nrJ^ng rock olimbing almost
impossible.
Twice a clay a small National Trust notice board rescinded
people of the dastardly massacre that had taken place in this
very spot nanjr years ago,yet • this did not prevent all present
•from taking part in a slightly less bloody massacre on T

w
Year's eve.This was celebrated in the traditional Scootish
style,whilst the Sassenach quickly realised that a toast to
the 'Creag T)huf
produced a wee drap from his more inebriated
Scotsman.
The heavy rain of New Year's eve washed away much of the
snow, arid the rain .and strong winds continued throughout the
day.Not dismayed by the frivolity of the night before,several
parties ventured outon T
T

w Year's day,most of then returning
in the reverse conditions of the Hogmonay celebrations -
extremely wet outside and regretably dry inside.
The we ather remained bad -aid i t was ir.rpossible to do any
serious climbing.The snow was slowly washed away,whist the
ice covered rocks were turned into a mixture of running water*
and melting ice.
Evans wins U.L. Championships
T.C. REATEN BY U.C.
On Saturday, Dec. 10th, l a s t year the
University Cross-Country Championships were held
over miles at Rochampton.
I.e. also held t h e i r i n t e r - c o l l e g e champion-
ships simultaneously. The f i n a l r e s u l t of t h i s
could have been e a s i l y forecast before the race
(1) Guilds, (11) R.C.S., (111) Mines.
In the U n i v e r s i t y match, however, things were
d i f f e r e n t . U.C. were very strong, and the I.C.
team was the strongest f o r many years.
We had 5 teams i n the race, altogether, which
was the largest entry from any college.
A f a l l of r a i n the night before had made the
horse-rides f i r m e r , but there was quite a strong,
cold wind blowing. This did not deter John Evans,
of I,C. from winning the race i n 37 seconds under
the previous record time, f o r which he imst be
h e a r t i l y congrulated. B i l l Pain was l u r next man
home, i n 7th p o s i t i o n , and the other of the scoring
five-were Conway(12th), Barber(15th) and Webster(19).
Chas C o t t e r i l l must be thanked f o r his e f f o r t s f o r ,
although he did not score, he rose from a sick-bed
to run.
The second tean did extremely w e l l t o f i n i s h
in 4th p o s i t i o n , being beaten only by U.C., T.C. 1st.
and L.S.E. Mention must be made of John C o l l i n s ,
whose b e a u t i f u l l y timed spurt half-way through the
race gained him many positions and made him f i r s t
man home f o r the 2nd tean, i n 27th p o s i t i o n .

HOCKEY
During the Michaelmas term the standard of
the 1st X I games varied from good to very bad.
The main trouble has been the lack of goal scoring
forwards as shown by the average of two goals per
game. The last two games, against Kingston Grammar
School and Leeds U n i v e r s i t y , were won 3-2 and 2-1
r e s p e c t i v e l y , and the forward play was d i s t i n c t l y
better than i n past games.
The second and t h i r d teams have been troubled
by the lack of a stable side. This i s partly due t o
the fact that the t h i r d team has to be run on a rota
system to provide as many people as possible with
a game.
The mixed Sunday XI has been very successful
both on and o f f the f i e l d . Several good freshworaen
have strengthened the side and the standard of
games has been unexpectedly high.
