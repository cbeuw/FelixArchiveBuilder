Editor: BILL HUDSON
The Exploration Board has met, and a large
son of money has now been committed to various
ventures that they have approved. These expedi
tions w i l l b r i n g more p u b l i c i t y to our College,
and show that we remain pioneers of ideas designed
to produce i n d u s t r i a l and s c i e n t i f i c leaders.
It i s now our r e s p o n s i b i l i t y to see that the
support i s given to these schemes. In t h i s way
many peaple w i l l gain experience from the organ-
i s a t i o n of an expedition, and at the same time
take some of the burden that the actual teams
w i l l carry.
The narakoram expedition i s the most specta
acular, and the i n i t i a l organisation has been
done by three students experienced i n mountain-
eering. The proposed investigation of behavior
of a raeltiug ice-cap i n \orway was made by an
undergraduate fresher, D. Bridgewafcer, ef the
R.C.S. This i s the kind of student p a r t i c i p a t i o n
that we want, and the acceptance and co-operation
of the Board i n t h i s suggestion shows that i t i s
g i v i n g opportunities to the student body that
we hardly thought possible. Let us hope that when
the Board next meets to consider proposed schemes
i t w i l l have a l a r g e r number offered, and that
these can a l l be given support.

LE PREMIER TOUR DE SOUTH KENSINGTON.

c a r n i v a l preparations, meals and the Post O f f i c e .
The f i r s t people to f i n d the Editor, who had

department. Ten ninut.es l a t e r , Messrs Boley, Stephen?
Styan and Webber appeared, also 2nd year e l e c t r i c a l s
followed by John Bronson and Clive Pearse from the
Physics department.
No sabotaging of the notices occured by i r a t e
members of the public who were as bewildered by the
cipher as some of the students, and no cases of
obstruction o f other uses o f i n i t i a t i v e were report-
ed.
The prize of whisky was opened and sampled.
Consolation prizes were drunk by many of the people
who f i n i s h e d the Treasure Hunt, and the success of
t h i s venture was celebrated throughout the weekend.

MOQNEY'S CHRISTMAS DINNER The dignity of a formal dinner
in Hall was tempered most delightfully with the Christmas
Spirit to provide one of the most pleasant(and best value
for money) events of last term.The I.C.ohoir,led by Miss
Imogen Hoist,gave a programme of oarols i n which everyone
"joined later.
JOBS SINGING After the R.C.S.Smoking Concert,the bar was
packed tight with the tight.After olosing tijne,cme party sat
to work to take down the stage which had to be removed before
the next day,while a ohoir of about fifty voices went round
to Q.A.,RobartHouseand Q.E.C.A large number of maidens
enjoyed the entertainment from the safety of high windows
but offered no perfarmanoe in return."It may be rare i n
Berkely Square but it's not oh the Rio Grand""
RECENT FDBUCATIQN:"Careers for Graduates"-edited by the
TJ.I* Appointments Board and published by the Athlone Press
at 5s.Qf on for 200 pages i t devotes 10 to Soienoe,15 to
Engineering and 8 toMining and Metallurgy.Strictly speaking,
every I.C.man ought to have already known a l l i t has to say
about his particular line before he oams here,but as this is
regrettably not the case with so many,the booklet may s t i l l
have something of value for quite a number.It i s well laid
out and, for its size,remarkably comprehensive;there i s l i t t l e
jr no mention of salarles-an unfartanate omission,but a
useful bibliography i s included. It will be of greater value
to arts students whose field of opartunies i s wide but sparse
while i t should be a "must" far schools. Par my part I found
i t interesting just to liesurely browse through it,refleot»
ing an what is happening to So-and -so and -what might have
; happened to me,had I taken So-and-so's advice.
THAT MAN AGAIN:' The day after PawneePotlatoh,the Evening
Standard reported that Brian Oggy had been taken to St
George's Hosp i t a l with a soalp wound,reoeived from someone'
tomahawk.However,interviewed by our reporter he stated:
"I pioked up a really hot bit of nurse from St.George's at
the Hop last week and heard during the cabaret that she was
on casualties that night so I shoved my nut through the
nearest pane of glass",,

Despite the Northern Daily Telegraph, we have
been assured that the method of selecting the team
for the Karakorara expedition has not yet been dec-
ided, so that t h e i r choice of one member was purely

I.C.Union,
Dear S i r ,
The student of manners w i l l have been appallwd
by the behaviour of some students during last term.
There were incidents when students were bad
mannered and thoughtless, but, on occasions a few
people behaved l i k e hooligans. I t seems that the
power to d i s t i n g u i s h between fun and games and
hooliganism has been temporarily l o s t .
To quote the incidents already referred would
be imprudent but I f e e l that the attention of the
students should be drawn to the dammage done i n the
Guilds a f t e r the l a s t I.C.Union Meeting. Several
benches i n the lecture room were found to have been
wantonly damaged. The cost to the Union f o r the
repair to the seats amounted to £15. Such behaviour
by students o f t h i s College i s very d i s q u i e t i n g .
In a few months a brand new b u i l d i n g w i l l be
available to. the Union and several thousands of
pounds w i l l have been spent on the decoration of the
i n t e r i o r . W i l l I.e. students s t i l l continue t o
behave i n a disorderly fashion when the new b u i l d i n g
i s open? The furure leaders of industry w i l l have
to improve t h e i r behaviou unless they want to be
treated l i k e schoolboys with d i s t a s t e f u l rules and
regulations.
Yours e t c . ,
Jim Anderson.
