I must pay t r i b u t e to the l i t e r a r y powers of my
i r i e n d and predecessor as E d i t o r of Phoenix, Mr, J .
Cox. The e d i t o r i a l produced i n the lates t e d i t i o n
demonstrates i r r e f u t a b l y the wealth of h i s iaaginatio
Seldom have I observed such f a c i l i t y i n g i v i n g a
coafused version of the s i t u a t i o n . Doubtless there
are some grains of t r u t h somewhere i n his denunciation
of the S.C.C. The trouble i s f i n d i n g them.
One of the more amusing f a i r y t a l e s he would
have us believe i s that the formation of a l l new
clubs i s opposed on p r i n c i p l e by the S.C.C. executive.
Had he forgotten that the wine t a s t i n g society was
formed barely s i x reonths ago? How did he come under
t h i s sad misapprehension?
For the uninrormed the S o c i a l Clubs Committee
e x i s t s to c o n t r o l , coordinate and develop the
s o c i a l a c t i v i t i e s of I.C. The d e t a i l s of these
a c t i v i t i e s are managed by the various clubs with
a non a t h l e t i c b i a s . The formation of new clubs and
coordination of finance i s c o n t r o l l e d by the S.C.C.
on which a representative of each s o c i a l club s i t s .
\t the end of l a s t session a Methodist Society
was proposed and i t was intimated that a Anglican
Society was l i k e l y to f o l l o w . With two interdenom-
i n a t i o n a l Protestant Societies already i n existence
the question was n a t u r a l l y asked would a c u t t i n g
of the Protestant C h r i s t i a n cake on s e c t a r i a n l i n e s
cause a diminution i n the strength of the e x i s t i n g
s o c i e t i e s ? Did not those s o c i e t i e s provide f o r the
sectarian demands of t h e i r members? The point was
not the i n t r i n s i c value of the sectarian s p l i t t i n g
but the need f o r i t .
Arising.from t h i s Council was caused to
contemplate the possible p r o l i f e r a t i o n of religous
s o c i e t i e s . Mike Neale put forward the t e n t a t i v e
suggestion that a c e r t a i n amount of d e c e n t r a l i s a t i o n
would be of value to the S.C*.C. and i n accord with
the s p i r i t of a u n i v e r s i t y . In his view a u n i v e r s i t y
should be a place where one met and conversed with
o f f e r i n g views i n order that the mind should be
broadened and one's own interests seen i n perspective.
Could not the religous s o c i e t i e s amalgamate to form
a Religous Association which would coordinate a l l
l e c t u r e s , prayer-meetings, b r a i n t r u s t s etc.,
arranged by i n d i v i d u a l s o c i e t i e s , and provide members
some insight into the v a r i e t y of r e l i g o u s b e l i e f s .
S i m i l a r l y an International Forum might
coordinate the a c t i v i t i e s of the N a t i o n a l i s t and
I n t e r n a t i o n a l i s t Clubs. The N a t i o n a l i s t Clubs,
although they are by nature v i r t u a l l y exclusive
in membership ( i f you are born and brought up a
Jew you cannot suddenly turn into a Arab) do an
sxcellent job i n introducing t h e i r various students
to t h e i r various c u l t u r e s . A s i m i l a r more general
job i s undertaken by the I n t e r n a t i o n a l Relations
Club. Might not the i n s u l a r i t y of the n a t i o n a l i s t s
clubs be ameliorated and the development of f u r t h e r
groups f a c i l i t a t e d by d e c e n t r a l i s i n g the S.C.C. i n
t h i s manner?
For completeness i t was also suggested that the
S o c i a l i s t and Conservative S o c i e t i e s returned to
t h e i r former union as s u b s i d i a r i e s of the old
P o l i t i c a l Society (thereby o f f e r i n g f a c i l i t i e s f o r
development of a club f o r Mr.Cox' f r i e n d s the anar-
c h i s t s ) .
This proposed d e c e n t r a l i s a t i o n of the S.C.C.
had the merits of providing f o r the f u r t h e r develop-
ment and coordination of a c t i v i t y of the r e l i g o u s ,
n a t i o n a l i s t and p o l i t i c a l s o c i e t i e s while decreasi
the s i z e of the S.C.C. itself._ The demerit, as was
soon eloquently pointed out, was the blow to the
pride of the i n d i v i d u a l clubs and t h e i r mutual
d i s t r u s t (except the C h r i s t i a n s ? ) of the thought
of possibl y leaving t h e i r representation on the
S.C.C. to persons with the interest of another group
at heart. Nobody r e c a l l e d that the Marxist L i t e r a r y
Gromp has f l o u r i s h e d f o r years with unabated vigour
as a subsidiary of the L i t e r a r y and Debating Society,
or that there had once been S o c i a l i s t , Concervarive
and L i b e r a l groups i n the P o l i t i c a l Society without
anyone dying of apoplexy.
Mr.Cox ended his harangue by asserting that
the S.C.C. has o u t l i v e d i t s e f f i c i e n c y and avering
that h i s c r i t i c i s m i s constructive. Looking through
his stimulating i f involved perovation one concludes
he does not l i k e the proposal f o r d e c e n t r a l i s a t i o n ;
constructive suggestions of an a l t e r n a t i v e organis-
ation f o r the s o c i a l clubs are conspicuous i n t h e i r
absence. Doubtless i n a few months time he w i l l have
some brainwave (such as chopping the S.C.C. i n h a l f )
which w i l l have us a l l gasping with admiration.
U n t i l then we might r e f l e c t that a l l important S.C.C.
decisions are taken by the f u l l committee and not
by the executive. And i t cannot be such a useless
committee i f every club i s so determined to remain
a member of i t .
LETTERS TO T H E E D I T O R
ing
December 13th 1955.
Dear S i r ,
As you know the f o l l o w i n g motion was
passed by an overwhelming majority at the l a s t
Union general Meeting:
"That, i n the opinion of t h i s Union, the
l o c a t i o n of a student's home should not a f f e c t
the quantity of h i s grant and, that such Local
Education A u t h o r i t i e s which do not subscribe to
t h i s opinion should have the opportunity of
hearing the views of I.C.Union on t h i s matter.
In order to f u r t h e r t h i s end. the Union
recommends that the Union Council endeavours
( s i c ) to discover whether the L.E.A.s which
previously refused to pay the State Scale f o r
student's ( s i c ) grants, are c a r r y i n g out the lates
recommendations of the M i n i s t r y of Education,"
I t would be of great assistance i f any
member of the Union who receives a grant from a
Local Education Authority which does not follow
the M i n i s t r y of Education scale, would contact me
i n w r i t i n g , g i v i n g the f o l l o w i n g information:-
(1) The name of the Authority concerned.
(2) The value of his (or her) grant ana the
value which i t would be i f assessed by the M i n i s t r y
of Education s c a l e .
A l l l e t t e r s w i l l be regarded as s t r i c t ! •

c o n f i d e n t i a l . Any f a c t s and f i g u r e s quoted must
be accurate.
