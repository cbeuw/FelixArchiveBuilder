Union awards announced
The Imperial College Union Awards
Ceremony was held yesterday (Thurs-
day June 13). The Awards Committee
chose the winners and Union Council
unanimously upheld the decision.
Union Fellowship with Distinction was
awarded to Nathaniel Bottrell, a long-
time trustee, and Stephen Richardson,
Deputy Rector of Imperial College Lon-
don.
The winners of the Awards and Fellow-
ship with Distinction were Nathaniel
Bottrell, a long-time trustee, and Profes-
sor Stephen Richardson, Deputy Rector
of Imperial College London. There was
also Union Fellowship for Dr Lorraine
Craig, Earth Science and Engineering
Academic Tutor. Many students were
awarded Union Colours and Outstand-
ing Service Award (see right). At the last
Union Council of the academic year
all of the sabbatical oﬃcers, including
Tim Arbabzadah, Felix Editor, and Shiv
Vorha (ICSMSU President) were award-
ed Honorary Life Membership.
The President’s Awards were also an-
nounced at the last Council of the year.
These are awarded by the Paul Beau-
mont, Union President, with no other
committee being involved and are his
personal pick of those that have sup-
ported the Union in an outstanding way.
Club, Society, or Project of the Year
President’s Award went to Caving Club
for discovery of the longest cave in Slo-
venia back at the beginning of the year.
Rhys Tyers Caving Club Chair said:
“Connecting our cave systems and
thereby discovering the longest cave in
Slovenia this summer was the crowning
achievement of over a decade of work
by the caving club. We think this pro-
ject has taken over a hundred person-
years of eﬀort and it’s really nice to see
this recognised by the union and RCC
through these awards.”
The Undergraduate Representation
President’s Award went to Biology Soc.
Aaron D’souza Biology Departmental
Representative said: “I think that there
have been a lot of people this year who
have put a lot of work and eﬀort and
dedication into making this year so suc-
cessful for the Biologists. In my case, I
have had a lot of support from the Bi-
oSoc, the Biology department, the Bio-
chemistry dep rep and Doug (Hunt).
Without them, Biology wouldn’t be
getting this award.” Doug Hunt, Deputy
President (Education), said that they
have “increased the number of their
Staﬀ-Student Committees for the next
academic year so more issues can be
raised and dealt with more swiftly”
. He
added that they have been heavily en-
couraging their lecturers to use Panopto
[lecture podcasting]”
.
The Postgraduate Representation
President’s Award went to the Business
School. Simon Schillebeeckx Business
School Departmental Representative
Aemun Reza News Editor
said: “Unfortunately I cannot be here
today as I am giving a talk at the Good-
enough College Conference in North
London. I am very happy to receive this
reward and that Paul and Doug decided
to award it to the Business School for
representation. I have tried my very best
to intermediate between the needs of
the students and the appropriate col-
lege channels. If I were successful in
my endeavours, I think this wouldn’t
have been possible without the fantastic
cooperation with Doug, Paul, Andrew
George, and Debra Humphries. Thanks
a lot”
. Hunt commented saying: “They
have convinced the College to increase
the PhD writing up period to 12 months
as Imperial is behind our competitors in
this respect, they have also helped give
the rest of the College academics insight
into the Business School’s workings and
have made the Graduate School write
various drafts for College policy e.g. the
double marking deﬁnition and group
plagiarism rules.”
The President’s Personal Awards were
given to three individuals. Professor
Stephen Richardson was again the re-
cipient of an award. Richardson was a
student at Imperial and completed his
PhD in 1975. He later returned as a
lecturer in 1978 and has been a perma-
nent ﬁxture of Imperial since 1987. He
was appointed Deputy Rector in 2009.
Beaumont said: “Stephen has been a
champion for the student voice and stu-
dent experience for the last twenty-ﬁve
years. Since his appointment as Deputy
Rector, he has been the go-to person
in the College Management – always
frank, honest and willing to listen. “ He
went on to say: “Stephen has been a
great help to the Union itself this year
too; helping with our new Partnership
Agreement, Code of Practice, Funding
and Space agreements. He has always
had a good word to say on the Union’s
behalf when it comes to campaigns like
#AgainstActon, the College Manage-
ment Board’s response to student views
on the new halls, the Holland Club and
Level 0, and the Union’s involvement in
that.” Beaumont also commented on the
good feedback he gets from his lectures
and his promotion of teaching when he
was Head of the Department of Chemi-
cal Engineering. He said: “Despite being
one of the most powerful ﬁgures in the
College, Stephen has never forgotten his
roots – nor probably his days as a stu-
dent here. This grounding creates a very
important friend for the Union.”
Also in for a double award was Lor-
raine Craig, who picked up a President’s
Award as well. Craig joined College in
2006 and since joining ESE SOLE &
NSS scores have shot up. Beaumont
described her as “a complete hit [with
the students”
. He said: “Lorraine knows
every single one of her students by name
– and makes it her job to ensure their
student experience is second to none.
She is – for all intents and purposes –
these students’ second mum.” He also
mentioned how she “always had a good
word to say on the Union’s behalf when
it comes to campaigns like #AgainstAc-
ton” and how she always comes up with
great initiatives.
The ﬁnal President’s Award was given
to Phillip Kent, a Chemistry student,
for his role as Systems Administra-
tor for the Union Website. Beaumont
said: “Imperial College Union literally
wouldn’t have a web presence without
Philip. Over the Summer 2012 he
helped myself, and two members of staﬀ
completely re-write the Union’s website,
which takes £1M of CSP transactions
each year. As SysAdmin, Philip has
worked selﬂessly to try and ensure the
security of one of the CSPs best com-
munication tools: Dougal, the Union
webserver. Without Philip, CSPs could
have lost their websites and individual-
ity, and the Central Union, the support
system. Philip has also written some of
the new systems that students and the
Union rely on for annual events: the
Mums and Dads matching system, for
one. For all of his contributions, I have
awarded Philip the President’s Award,
and the Council has awarded him an
Outstanding Achievement Award.”
