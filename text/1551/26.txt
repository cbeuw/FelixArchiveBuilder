Girls go camping, things go wrong

The Company You Keep
Director: Robert Redford
Screenwriters: Lem Dobbs, Neil
Gordon (book)
Starring: Robert Redford, Shia
LaBeouf, Julie Christie
Robert Redford’s standing in Hol-
lywood must be a good one for him
to have attracted so much star power
and talent for his latest directorial ef-
fort that is at best, distinctly average.
Marketed as a clever political thrill-
er, it shows a lot of promise from its
opening scenes, but what we ﬁnd is a
gradual dip in quality as it becomes
clear the ﬁlm doesn’t have too much
to say for itself.
After years of hiding out, a noto-
rious wanted fugitive is arrested by
the FBI. As part of the anti-Vietnam
War militant Weather Underground,
Sharon Solarz (Susan Sarandon) was
wanted for a bank robbery that re-
sulted in murder a few decades ago.
Her arrest leads to the sharp, ambi-
tious young reporter Ben Shepard
(Shia LaBeouf) to do his own digging

around the terrorist group Solarz was
involved in. His investigation leads to
Jim Grant (Robert Redford), a lawyer
hiding out in Albany under an alias.
Leaving his young daughter (Jackie
Evancho) with his brother (Chris
Cooper) who is less than thrilled to
be in contact with him, Grant goes
on the run, although Ben is deter-
mined to get a story out of this due
to his pushy editor’s (Stanley Tucci)
insistence.
What exactly is Grant after? To
clear his name, maintain his inno-
cence, and the only person who can
do this is the elusive Mimi Lurie
(Julie Christie) with whom he shared
something special back in the day.
This little reunion between the two is
delayed for far too long as we see far
too much of Ben’s investigative jour-
nalism. There isn’t anything wrong
with showing us the methods, the
keen reporter doing whatever he can
to ﬁnd a story he can print, but it’s
often what he discovers that’s of little
interest. There are children involved,
adoption, paternity issues, but these
don’t contribute to the overall narra-
tive. It only slows down and distracts
us from what’s truly important.
Once Jim and Mimi do end up in
the same room, it leads to a heartfelt,
intelligent discussion about their val-
ues, beliefs and ideals – what they be-
lieved so passionately in the 70s don’t
quite hold the same weight in the
current context. Another theme that
crops up is whether there is any re-
gret, remorse or guilt about past ac-
tions. Whatever they do or don’t feel
can’t excuse their actions, the char-
acters know this too, and the heated
exchange between the two, although
brief, is a deep, insightful one: a wor-
thy wrap-up of preceding events.
Aside from those already men-
tioned, other big names in the cast
appearing include Brendan Gleeson,
Terrence Howard, Anna Kendrick,
Nick Nolte, Richard Jenkins, Sam
Elliott and Brit Marling. Do they all
serve a purpose to further the story
or are they merely a distraction?
They end up as a little bit of both,
with understated performances all-
round contributing to this greatly
restrained piece.
It’s not as informative or power-
ful as Redford’s previous politically
driven picture, the highly underrated
and underseen Lions for Lambs, but
the appeal here is still huge, start-
ing with the stars, its opening, and a
neat ﬁnish that successfully plays on
the chemistry between Redford and
Christie.
It’s a shame the middle ﬁlling isn’t
quite as gripping as it should have
been. It could have been shorter, and
the many famous names should have
been put to better use.
There’s something almost primeval
about the way the characters here
conduct themselves. Cut oﬀ from
civilisation with no technology to
help them, the women here need to
resort to the bare minimum to stay
alive, and here is a gritty, unﬂinching
survival drama that is impressively
made, with brisk action and nasty
surprises here and there.
When three female childhood
friends decide to go away together on
a camping trip, they put their diﬀer-
ences aside and try their best to have
a good time. Something about sleep-
ing with the wrong man put some
awkward tension between Abby
(Katie Aselton) and Lou (Lake Bell)
whereas the one caught between the
conﬂict, Sarah (Kate Bosworth), is
playing peace-keeper among the trio.
Despite some explosive verbal argu-
ments, the trio’s lives are at least safe,
until they run into three men: Henry
(Will Bouvier) Derek (Jay Paulson)
and Alex (Anslem Richardson), all of
them seemingly harmless at ﬁrst, but
when one of them can’t take an ulti-
mate “no” as an answer at the end of
some full-on ﬂirtation, all hell breaks
loose.
The men have guns (actual ﬁring
guns, not referring to their anatomy
here), the women have nothing, ex-
cept possibly some knowledge about
the island they’re on. It’s an impos-
sible situation but the game is on,
and they need to ﬁght to even have
a chance to get oﬀ the remote island
alive. Everything escalates beauti-
fully up to this point, and there is
genuine worry and concern as to just
how the three of them will be coming
out on top in this ridiculously out-
matched scenario.
And as with many thrillers carry-
ing this kind of synopsis, it’s inevita-
ble that some characters make silly
decisions and do some downright
bizarre things that you know will get
them killed at some point. Despite
their lives being at risk, they ﬁnd the
time to talk about the unresolved el-
ephant in the room – and manage to
ﬁnd closure whilst covered in blood,
cuts and bruises. But with stupidity
comes a body count, which isn’t an
entirely bad thing.
By the time you see the plot resolv-
ing, there will have been a decent
amount of fun, some brutal ﬁghts,
and a satisfying conclusion that
doesn’t oﬀer any deadly last-minute
twists, but a wholly acceptable one
nonetheless.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit
