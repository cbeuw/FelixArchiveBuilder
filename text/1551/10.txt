RCSU – Year in Review
With the RCSU Summer Ball just around the corner, James Tsim,
RCSU President, talks about the year that has just gone by
his academic year is com-
ing to a close with exams
and ﬁnal year projects
and soon the next RCSU
committee will be tak-
ing the reins. We hope that you have
enjoyed reading RCSU Broadsheet
this year and keep reading next year!
The RCSU this year has had fantas-
tic turn-outs to events, with Freshers
enjoying a taste of top class bars in
Chelsea during our pub crawl, taking
full advantage of our Autumn Ball to
make friends and amazing discounts
at the ‘RCSU Bookshop’. As usual
Mascotry was rife in the RCSU, with
us successfully acquiring the CGCU
Spanner and Bolt during fresher’s
fair which ultimately led to pieing
of Temi Ladega (CGCU President).
Freshers also got involved and I was
surprised by a mysterious looking
group of Freshers knocking on the
oﬃce door carrying the Medics mas-
cot (Phoenix costume).
First term was jam packed with
career events from Ernst & Young
and Deutsche Bank as well as inno-
vative and informative lectures from
the Imperial College Business School
and Imperial Innovations. The aim
was to build on the long term ben-
eﬁts for students and making them
aware of the broad range of opportu-
nities inside and outside of science.
RCSU Welfare Week was also a big
hit, with students fully exploiting the
STI Clinic, Doctor Bike and Self-de-
fence classes. On top of that students
enjoyed the free smoothies which
were handed out along with highly
subsidised ice-skating. The Union
does care about student welfare more
than you think and with over 1000
free RCSU branded condoms handed
out this year, I need not comment
further on the sexual activity of stu-
dents in the RCSU.
The joint CGCU-RCSU Winter Ball
was a sell-out, held at an all exclusive
venue with a £10,000 bar tab. Some
people may question whether it was
a good idea to let the engineers near
our RCSU girls or whether £10,000 is
too much. But a party with a gather-
ing of around 700 Imperial students,
this is the largest Imperial party pre-
ceeding Christmas and an awesome
end to an awesome ﬁrst term.
RCSU RAG this year has been ex-
T
tremely active such as helping in the
organisation of a cake sale for chari-
ty. A few members of the RCSU team
also took part in Movember to raise
money for men’s health. Currently
the RCSU is running a campaign and
accepting donations to support the
Bangladesh Factory disaster. Find
out more by going to the RCSU’s Fa-
cebook page.
The start of 2013 saw the launch of
the RCSU Science Challenge hosted
by our Science Challenge Chair,
Ryan Browne. This is our annual es-
say writing competition, which this
year saw an additional twist with the
addition of a video category. This
competition was open to all Imperial
students and a large range of second-
ary schools. With over £4000 worth
of prizes, a trip to CERN and a ﬁnal
at the House of Lords, this is one of
the largest science communication
competitions in the UK. A big thank
you to our judges, which this year
included Lord Robert Winston, Sir
Brian Hoskins, Sir Roy Anderson and
Dr Jad Marrouche.
Towards Easter, the RCSU Spring
Ball took place at the cosy Warwick
Bar. The theme was Red & White,
where we tried to challenge some
of the conventions of a formal ball.
Girls came dressed in beautiful red
and white dresses, whilst many a
man came in red chinos with a white
shirt.
The end of term also saw the RCSU
Interdepartmental Quiz, where the
Dep Socs came together to organise
a successful quiz night, intellectually
challenging many a student.
The end of academic year 2012/13
is fast approaching, so join the RCSU
for a ﬁnal party at Grace Bar on the
25th June 2013. Let’s end this year at
the RCSU Summer Ball with a blast.
£9000 has been placed behind the
bar, so get ready for the PARTY OF
THE YEAR! For those graduating
there is a Final Year’s Dinner prior to
this which comes with a champagne
reception and 3 course meal.
Finally I hope that you have en-
joyed the RCSU this year and I would
like to take this opportunity to thank
all the volunteers in the RCSU com-
mittee for their hard work and wish
the best of luck to Plabon Saha,
RCSU President-elect.
RCSU with their Jezebel
Future RCSU President Plabon saha.
He’s really sensitive about his dis-
figured feet. Best not to mention it...
One of the RCSU balls.
Sweaty balls. Mmmmmmm
