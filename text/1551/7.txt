FRIDAY 14 JUNE
Meet the new faces of the Union WHAT THIS YEAR’S TEAM SAY THEY’VE DONE
Paul Beaumont, President
Out of all the things I’ve done that
students will notice, I’m most proud
about the Union’s successful #Again-
stActon campaign, and the number
of responses to College and Govern-
ment we’ve written on behalf of stu-
dents, the recommendations we’ve
made (and acted on, when in a posi-
tion to do so) to improve the student
experience. There are many things
only a few will notice but have huge
implications for the Union: I guess I’m
pretty proud I registered the Union as
a charity with the Charity Commis-
sion to ensure we keep our charitable
status in the future. Introducing two
free drinks at the Summer Ball is only
a partial implementation of my mani-
festo promise, but I was wrong to say
it would be aﬀordable to have an open
bar: it is much more expensive to run
a ball at a venue that isn’t normally a
nightclub (ie on campus!).
Stefan Nubert, DPFS
There are a few things I’m happy about
achieving this year. The ﬁrst one is the
major restructuring of the commer-
cial services at ICU. This may not be
instantly visible to students and it’s
actually still on going (should be ﬁn-
ished by mid-July). It was a manifesto
point for me and something I am pas-
sionate about improving. It’s actually
made parts of this year very frustrat-
ing for me, waiting on processes to
complete but now ICU’s commercial
services are in a much stronger posi-
tion for the future now the diﬃcult
phases are over. Going forward the
new management (once fully in place)
will continue to improve things. It
also gave more life to the role of the
DPFS, making it signiﬁcantly more
“hands on” than in previous years.
Another point is the re-introduction
of drinks oﬀers. I had to push hard
for these initially, but having built a
strong working relationship with the
commercial services manager we’ve
introduced a good range of oﬀers. A
list of a few other little things such as
giving a pay-rise to the senior student
staﬀ, making We Are Metric nights
cheaper for clubs, proposing future
ﬁnancial safeguards, upping slightly
the grant awarded to CSB along with
an increase to the IC Trust fund-
ing for tours (jointly with Henry the
DPCS) and introducing sorted recy-
cling to our bars.
A ﬁnal almost trivial point, but im-
portant to me, was being approach-
able as a sabbatical and being as quick
as I could to respond to and deal
with club queries. I feel I’ve mostly
accomplished this, but as ever with
the sheer volume of these, there will
be those who felt I wasn’t eﬃcient
or helpful enough dealing with their
problem and I can only apologise for
that. Overall I feel our sabbatical team
has accomplished a number of major
points this year and cooperated on a
great number of projects.
Doug Hunt, DPE
I have built on the great work the
previous DPE’s have done before me
– improving the “You Said, We Did”
campaign, running 2 Rep Weeks (with
doubling the number of tips sent to
your reps), NSS 2012 Response and
giving a more detailed breakdown of
what takes place in all the Staﬀ-Stu-
dent Committees across the College.
Through benchmarking and seeking
student opinion on international op-
portunities the College is now oﬀering
funded summer research placements
at several other world class universi-
ties, while I have also helped increase
survey turnout in SOLE and the NSS.
I also worked with the Departmental
Societies to increase the number of
students taking part in the Mums &
Dads scheme, made sure every Dep
Soc has a Fresher Facebook group
to welcome ﬁrst years, raised over
£700 for them via Soc Oﬀ events
and already made sure the incoming
committees are trained, so it can be
improved for next year. This year we
also launched the A-Z rep ﬁnder on-
line tool and the Student Academic
Choice Awards, which allows students
to reward some of the College’s best
academics, support staﬀ or Graduate
Teaching Assistants. Lastly, the entire
Sabbatical team and I worked together
on a vast range of projects together to
try and improve the student experi-
ence at Imperial.
Becky Lane, DPW
It’s been much more hectic than I
could have ever imagined but all the
more enjoyable for it! This year I have
written the ﬁrst Student Experience
Survey response which will be used
by College to improve and shape the
student experience at Imperial. I have
began work with ICT to try and solve
the age old personal tutor problem
(something which I really hope re-
mains a priority). Lots of exciting pro-
jects I hadn’t even considered when I
ran for election have popped up, as I
hurriedly write this I am in the process
of writing a bid to the NUS/HEFCE
to try and get the Union £240,000 of
funding to spend on green projects.
Despite all of that, I’m pretty sure I
will just be remembered as the girl
who got the petting zoo, bouncy castle
and massages… which isn’t the worst
legacy in my opinion.
Tim Arbabzadah, Felix Editor
Well, I’m not really sure exactly what
to write here, despite it being my idea.
So here goes nothing. This will, in all
likelihood, be a mini manifesto re-

Age: 20

Year: 2
Why I ran: The position allows me
to get fully stuck into the Union,
enabling me to dedicate all my time
and effort to it. This is what I have
been craving all year.
Next year I aim to ensure the peo-
ple who volunteer their time to
run clubs & socs get all the sup-
port they need to do so, this is
especially important for chairs
and treasurers. I plan to increase
student involvement in clubs &
socs by running a re-freshers fair
and encouraging more engaging
promotion of clubs & socs events.
I also aim to improve the training
depsocs receive to facilitate bet-
ter and more varied department-
wide events. And finally, I hope to
be a friendly face so people feel
they can come and discuss in per-
son any problems they might face
in running clubs & socs.
Age: 21
Course: Biology
Year: Final
Why I ran: I have had a great time
being involved in clubs & societies
and it has been a massive part of
my experience at Uni. I want to
encourage more students to get
involved in things other than their
studies so this great experience
can be shared, and hope by mak-
ing the running of clubs & socs
easier, more people will do so.
Next year I will be working for you
over in the Union offices. It will be
my job to listen to your comments
and ideas and, along with my own
experience, improve everything
I can. One of my main goals is to
make more students proud to be
part of Imperial College Union.
I hope to do this by giving eve-
ryone a better understanding of
what we actually do and how
much most students, one way or
another, actually use the services
on offer. I also have a lot of ideas
when it comes to our bars, and
not just in South Ken, to ensure
they provide a relaxed, social and
student focused atmosphere that,
most importantly, everyone wants
to use. However the Union is not
just the building or facilities it
provides, I plan to make sure it is
as easy as possible to play sports,
join and run clubs and societies
and organise events. Keep an eye
out and throughout the year I’ll
make sure you’re updated on eve-
rything that’s happening. And if
you have any ideas or just want to
know what I’m doing and you see
me about just let me know!

Why I ran:The Union has been a
big part of my life, I want to make
it even better and I’m excited to
spend another year here.
me about just let me know!
Next year I want to focus on the
good stuff rather than just the
bad. This year the first Student
Academic Choice Awards were
held, and next year I want to
make these bigger and get more
students nominating those mem-
bers of staff who really make a
positive impact on their time at
Imperial. Increasing awareness of
UROP will hopefully increase the
number of research opportuni-
ties for undergraduate students
interested in research, while in-
creasing the number of places on
BEST courses will benefit more
business-minded individuals. A
job for all of us will be to ensure
that we are involved in every deci-
sion made about the development
at Acton, so that future Imperial
students have the best possible
student experience.

for DPE in the hope that I can
make you all love it too.
tudent experience.
The main aim for next year is to
ensure Imperial is an inclusive
and positive experience for all
of our students. The prospect of
many of Imperial’s undergradu-
ates living out in Acton has really
highlighted the need to tailor wel-
fare for incoming students which
doesn’t rely on proximity to South
Kensington; a goal which would
no doubt benefit post-graduate
students who can be similarly
vulnerable, especially if moving
to London for the first time. In a
similar vein, I’m keen to work with
the newly-elected welfare officers
to ensure the needs of all students
are represented and fought for.
I’m also really looking forward
to continuing and expanding the
Stress Less scheme and STI clinics
started by Becky, to ensure they
are sustainable for many years to
come.
Age: 22

Year: 4
Why I ran: I decided running was
more constructive than complain-
ing... and my housemates happen
to be very persuasive.
Next year’s Felix will be bigger
and better! We’ll be producing
more news and featuring con-
tributions from a larger range of
students from all campuses and
as well as introducing a “What’s
On” section and a Careers section.
We’ll also take a closer look at the
Union and bring you interesting
features and surveys.
For next year I plan to open Fe-
lix to the masses by providing an
easy article submission system
and providing explanations about
how we operate. I will start with
the aforementioned new sections
(What’s On, Careers) and excit-
ing surveys. My focus for the next
year is to expand Felix with more
content relevant to the average
Joe Huxley on all campuses.

ment for all Imperial students.
view.
Firstly, I redesigned the paper and
did a (pretty needed) deep clean of
the oﬃce. The latter people didn’t see
unless involved in some way. Hope-
fully, the paper and oﬃce look pretty.
I think I kept up the fun tone, and
hopefully made it enjoyable to read
– including an added page of light
relief. I also tried to do some investi-
gative news stories. The international
student fees one and the (controver-
sial, sorry) look at workloads spring
to mind. I regret that I didn’t get to
do more of these. I had plans that I
still think would be great; the weekly
pressures of getting the news and pa-
per together meant that I just didn’t
ﬁnd the time, and, for that, I am sorry.
I tried to bring all of the news to you
in an unbiased and informative way.
I deﬁnitely do think that I held
College and the Union to account, I
think. I don’t think I ever didn’t say
what I thought on the matter. Loads
of things spring to mind: Acton,
Translation Studies, Holland Club.
I lowered Clubs and Socs adverts
and was very accommodating in
terms of prices (ask any of them!).
Where I failed: I didn’t ever hold a
proper oﬃce party open to everyone.
It would have been awesome, but I
tried a smaller version and realised
it probably was a bad idea with the
computers. I’ll hold my hands up and
say my bad, but you can pop down to
the oﬃce and say hi whenever you like
and I’ll always ﬁnd time for you. I also
didn’t hand out papers personally on
Friday. Maybe I will one of the last
two weeks. To be honest, you prob-
ably didn’t want to see me at that tired
state.
Overall, I tried to make the paper
the best it could be. I worked myself
to near madness this year, and hope-
fully it paid oﬀ in some way!

My main focus for next year is the
relationship between the students
and the College. Much greater no-
tice must be taken of student pref-
erence before decisions, big and
small, are made. This extends into
all areas of the student experience
and I am hinting here in particular
to the building of halls in North
Acton. My aim is to vastly improve
the input students have on these
decisions. I will be working closely
with Nat (DPE) and the Pro Rector
(Education) to ensure that the new
education strategy that is being im-
plemented is tailored toward what
students feel is currently lacking.
With regard to the Union, the em-
phasisagainwillbeongettinggreat-
er student input. This is particularly
the case with regard to the Union
bar,MetricandtheSummerBall.
A unique plan of mine for next
year will be to investigate the im-
plementation of a free half-day each
year in which students in the lower
years at the University are able to
engage together in charity fundrais-
ing or volunteering. This will likely
be a great challenge to achieve but
