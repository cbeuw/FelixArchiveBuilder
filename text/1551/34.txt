Slitherlink
Riddle Time
Ophis
Continuing the time-honoured tradition of featuring Slitherlink since forever ago.
Rules: draw a single closed loop by vertically and horizontally joining the dots so that
the numbered squares are surrounded by the corresponding number of lines.
Answers to Double Trouble: a) Possible combinations
are (15, 12), (14, 13). The second one is impossible
without violating the requirement that opposite
sides of a die add up to 7, so the answer is (15, 12)
b)The answer is £70, because who would pay 3 extra
quid for a 9 when a 6 is available?
SIX

Decipher
the sum.
Each letter
corresponds
to exactly one
number.
Fill in the circles with
numbers from 1 to 8 so
that any two connected
numbers differ by at
least 2.
Fill the cells with a continuous line that does not pass through a cell twice, doesn’t
intersect with itself, and passes through all white boxes. The numbers show you
how many times the line turns in the corresponding row or column. The snake
enters and exits the grid at the shown points (and only those points). There are
some hints to get you started.
