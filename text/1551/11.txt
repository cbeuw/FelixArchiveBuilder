kay, so you’ve studied
here for perhaps as
much as four years, or
maybe even more. You
look at your peers on
your course and perhaps it doesn’t oc-
cur to you that they may soon become
‘persona not grata’ due to visa restric-
tions, and very soon be unceremoni-
ously removed from the country.
It’s odd to think that HM Govern-
ment would be so keen to deport
hard-working, intelligent people at a
time of economic diﬃculty like this.
But, unfortunately, they lack those
magic words ‘European Union’ on
their passports and so they’re screwed.
Never mind that they may be Austral-
ians or Canadians or Hong Kongers,
who are British in all but name, and
whose family sacriﬁced so much to
keep us free from oppression in the
1940s. They’re not welcome, oh no!
It’s really disgusting, our priorities
as a country. Firstly, our Government
ﬁghts to prevent giving Right of Abode
to Gurkhas, and it’s only in the face of
a campaign by Joanna Lumley and
both the Conservatives and Lib Dems
that the then Labour Government re-
lents. Secondly, we’ve had a Govern-
ment reluctant to allow loyal Afghan
interpreters, fearful for their lives, the
right to live here.
However you look at it, it’s a weird
set of priorities. Those who have put
their trust in Britain get screwed over,
yet those who have contributed noth-
ing get everything, just because we’re
members of an undemocratic, self-
serving organisation like the European
Union.
What’s perhaps worse than the cas-
es I’ve highlighted is those of British
Nationals (Overseas). They are Hong
Kongers, born before the Handover to
communist China, who chose to adopt
some form of British Nationality while
they still lived in a British territory.
Their passports look exactly like ours,
have the Royal Crest on the front, and
are issued with the full authority of
the Crown. Woe betide them, how-
ever, if they thought they could live in
the country of their nationality! No,
BN(O) gives no rights to live in the
UK. You may have moved to Hong
Kong thinking the British would pro-
tect you from the evil regime you ﬂed.
I’m afraid you were mistaken. Our
Government, guided by our civil ser-
vice, doesn’t care about you. We only
care about being ‘good Europeans’.
If you do have a sense of right and
wrong, and are a British Subject, you
can sign a petition about giving full
rights to BN(O)s at http://epetitions.

The Government’s treatment of overseas nationals is reprehensi-
ble, and is threatening a large number of students at Imperial

Our pick of the best banter from felixonline.co.uk
In response to “College put students
last at Harlington” (31st May)
Finally someone had the guts to say it.
IC is a total sell out, the students al-
ways come last. Renting out the Queen’s
Lawn to put up marquees thoughout
the whole spring/summer, selling oﬀ the
Holland Club for yet another catering
outlet, selling oﬀ Evelyn Gardens and
Clayponds in order to ship oﬀ the ﬁrst
year students to North Acton, and the
list goes on. Let’s face it, at IC it’s all
about the money. This place is run like a
business, not a university. It’s a disgrace.
---
Bring on the further commercialisa-
tion of the college! Who needs students
anyway? Wouldn’t IC make a lot more
money without us getting in the way at
all?
I look forward to reading the college’s
public response in Felix.
Oh wait.

Can’t believe they made people park
next to bins! What a disgrace!
I was playing at Harlington the same
day, and as I recall it was sunny, so no
need to shelter in the car. I agree that
the college sometimes puts students as a
secondary priority, but this article just
seems like someone whining because
they didn’t get to park in their usual
place. Boo hoo. The walk from those
bins 20 metres or so away from the
hockey pitch isn’t exactly a mission.
Talking about WW1 is frankly irrela-
vant and just sensationalist.
The fact that QPR has use of the train-
ing grounds has given IC football use of
professional football coaches almost
every training. And QPR’s predecessor
at Harlington, Chelsea built the arti-
ﬁcial pitch, which is used every week
by Imperial’s 1st team. But yes, these
beneﬁt’s deﬁnately do not outweigh the
humiliation of having to park next to a
bin. Can’t beleive Imperial are debasing
alumni in this way. What an abuse of
human rights!

The college needs to start putting stu-
dents ﬁrst, but this type of article needs
to be written by someone with real
grievances. I don’t mean to be so con-
frontational, but I did ﬁnd using the
fallen from WW1 to back up an argu-
ment against parking next to bins quite
disrespectful.
And at the risk of disagreeing with an-
other comment above, IC students are
very lucky to have free use of Ethos for
the duration of their studies. Not many
other students can say the same, and
have to pay huge membership fees for
gym use.
Having said that, I do feel the univer-
sity is being increasingly run for proﬁt,
and I do agree with the author of the ar-
ticle about sport being a central part of
university life. It has certainly been my
best experience at uni, and I hope the
college’s attitude does not spoil this for
future students.
---
It’s not just the sports facilities. The
number of times as a student the Un-
ion Bar has been closed to students for
private functions (for external non stu-
dents) or we have been evicted from ta-
bles “reserved” for similar is ridiculous.
