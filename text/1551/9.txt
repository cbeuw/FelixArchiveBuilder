FRIDAY 14 JUNE
E-lighting up
Two smokers give the
new E-Lites a test to see
what they’re like
Others in the Felix Oﬃce will vouch
for this. My ﬁrst words on smoking
my allocated e-cigarette were, “this
tastes like smoking a dusty egg in a
sauna”. In my all too numerous re-
turns to the device I never managed
to elucidate a more pithy nor precise
description of the experience. As you
can probably tell by now, this re-
view will not be positive. Mine
came in a red box, which
apparently means regu-
lar strength, meaning
you get the full eggy
experience.
Now, I am on record
as being a fairly una-
bashed smoker. I have
inhaled some pretty
knarly things in my
time from the
relatively throat
s c r a t c h y
G a u l o i s e s
t h o u g h
dodgy Bul-
g a r i a n
counter-
feits up to
an includ-
ing, to my
smoulder-
ing regret, rollies
drunkenly assem-
bled from bus tick-
ets (never do that).
All of these had a
taste which vaguely
harked back to
something that
might have
once come
from a plant
including, technically, t h a t
one bread stick (never do that either).
The E-light did not hark back to
anything apart from possibly a starch
ﬁlled swimming pool. See, I never
beat the eggs – ﬁguratively. The claim
that one charge replaces 30 cigarettes
was fairly ludicrous and it is going
take a few weeks to repair the damage
my street-cred accrued when the guy
from the oﬀ-licence saw me smoking
it on the way home. In conclusion de-
spite what advertisers would have us
believe about the bight new dawn of
the i-fag, very much like its brethren
ebooks, prophylactics and Prii (the
plural of Prius – jeez, read a book),
the old ways are the most certainly the
best. – Meredith Thomas
I chose the menthol ﬂavoured E-Lite
for two important reasons: 1) The
packet was green 2) Menthol is kind
of a goth thing, so I felt I owed it to
my subculture. When I smoke, which
isn’t often, I really want my nicotine
the very instant I start smoking. Find-
ing my lighter and igniting the damn
thing is as much of a delay as I can
tolerate, so I really don’t appre-
ciate having to coax the ciga-
rette into life by sucking on
it until it warms up. No-
body wants to feel like
a ﬂuﬀer from a 1970’s
porn studio.
Other than that, the
only real complaint I have
is that I found myself inca-
pable of putting it down.
They’re supposed to be
healthier, but not
when you have the
sudden ability to
smoke anywhere
and at any time.
In the week and
a half before
it ran out of
puﬀ (chortle),
I think I prob-
ably took in
around three
times my usual
level of nicotine.
Don’t get me
wrong, these
things are awe-
some, and I’m
starting to
wonder how
I ever went to
the library
without one,
but it’s just not the same
as a real c i g a re tte .
There’s no feeling of
w a r m t h , there’s no
feeling of tr iumph
as you dis- play your
mastery of ﬁre, and,
most impor- t a n t l y ,
it doesn’t look nearly as
cool. –Frank Machin
