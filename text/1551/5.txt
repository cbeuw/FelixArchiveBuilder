The Union Council this week unani-
mously passed a paper opposing plans
by a number of UK universities to
replace the current system of degree
classiﬁcation with US style grade point
averages (GPA). The group of twelve
universities – including King’s Col-
lege London and UCL, but not Impe-
rial – ﬁrst published their plans in June
2011. The new system would involve
students being assigned letter grades
for each piece of assessment. Each
grade would be assigned a numerical
value between 0.00 and 4.25 with the
ﬁnal grade being a weighted average of
these numerical values.
The Union Council, however, re-
jected arguments that the GPA was
superior to the current system since
it is better understood internationally
and provides more information to po-
tential employers. Instead the Council
raised the point that the GPA would
lead to a greater focus on marks rather
than learning course material. This
would further lead to more stress for
students and might encourage some to
take easier modules. It was also point-
ed out that introducing a new system
would lead to more confusion. The
currently proposed system would be
particularly confusing as it would go
up to 4.25 and not 4.00, as is the case in
most US universities, and it would not
“align itself with the one for A-levels,
which is letter grade and percentages”.
The passed paper states that the
GPNAY – Union Council unanimously
opposes the GPA
Union believes that “Imperial College
London should keep the traditional
British degree class marking system”
and that “switching to a GPA mark-
ing system would be a misuse of Col-
lege resources”. The Council resolved
to inform both the College and the
group of universities which favour the
change that the Imperial “student body
opposes a GPA marking system”.
Speaking to Felix Debra Humphris,
Pro Rector (Education), conﬁrmed
that there had so far been no discus-
sions in College about changing the
degree classiﬁcation system.

One of the letters sent to Sir Keith
O’Nions praised the service and “su-
perb care” oﬀered and said that the
writer was “surprised and dismayed”
to hear the eviction and hoped the
“absurd” and “ﬂawed decision” would
be changed. The letter went on to sug-
gest the optician could move, saying:
“It seems anyway rather odd that so
small a space should apparently make
such a diﬀerence to your plans for
expansion – if this particular space
is indeed so very vital could you not
ﬁnd room elsewhere on campus for
Vision@SW7?”
Khambalia told Felix: “All staﬀ and
students who are ﬁnding out about
the closure are absolutely up in arms
about it.” Khambalia said that the
practice have no local area to relocate
to at the present time.
The opticians has been there since
2000 and was bought by Vision at SW7
three years ago in a private deal with
the previous owners. As a result of
this purchase, Vision at SW7 say that
their removal will mean “the loss of
Opticians sorry to leave
[a] £70,000 investment” and said that
“no compensation [is] being oﬀered”.
College say that this loss is from the
private deal made with the previous
owners, which did not involve College.
Khambalia said that after buying the
store they “have really turned it round
and previous customers who had gone
somewhere else are returning to us”.
The optician has started a campaign
to be allowed to stay. This includes a
petition in store and the posters (pic-
tured) that have gone up in the win-
dows.
