Opticians on Walkway shutting down
The optician on the Sherﬁeld walkway
is set to close. Just before Easter, the
optician was called and told that the
lease is being rescinded and that they
have six months to leave – serving
them notice is in the provisions of the
lease. They will be gone by September
and have been told that a new catering
facility will be in their place.
Felix contacted Shabbir Khambalia
BDS, Practice Director of Vision at
SW7, who said: “The notice came as a
great shock to us out of the blue. I was
called one day just before Easter and
told that my lease is being rescinded
and that I have 6 months notice to
vacate the premises. In an instant the
College took away my livelihood. No >>5

Report raises concerns over educational access
Bursary and outreach programmes praised but improved participation needed
>>4
A recent joint report from the Oﬃce
for Fair Access (OFFA) and the Higher
Education Funding Council for Eng-
land (HEFCE) has raised concerns
about the eﬀorts made by elite Eng-
lish universities to increase numbers
of students from low income back-
grounds. The report, focusing on the
2011-2012 academic year, was gener-
ally positive about the eﬀorts of most
higher education institutions but rec-
ognised key areas for improvement.
In an introduction to the report Pro-
fessor Les Ebdon – Direction of Fair
Access to Higher Education, and for-
mer Felix Editor! – commented that
evidence showed “sustained improve-
ments in participation, including for
students from the most disadvantaged
backgrounds”. The report went on to
highlight data showing how “18 year
olds from the most disadvantaged ar-
eas are 80 per cent more likely to apply
to higher education in 2013 than they
were in 2004”. Sir Alan Langlands,
Chief Executive of the HEFCE – the
body responsible for distributing gov-
ernment higher education funding
– praised universities’ bursary and
outreach programmes, saying that “in
2011-12 the sector again committed
ﬁnancial resources well in excess of
the funding provided by HEFCE for
widening participation, retention and
disability”. In total, English universities
spend over a billion pounds a year on
outreach activities and bursaries.
Professor Ebdon went on to admit,
however, that “the most selective insti-
tutions have made little or no headline
progress in increasing access in recent
years”. Despite year-on-year increases
in bursary and outreach spending
Imperial College has performed par-
ticularly poorly in this regard, with
only 18.1% of undergraduate students
in the 2011-2012 academic year com-
ing from families with incomes of less
than £25,000 a year. Only six English
higher education institutions (Oxford,
Cambridge, Bristol, the Cour-
alternative site has been oﬀered and
no real explanation given except that
they want to increase the catering
facilities within the College and our
service does not meet the College’s
requirements.”
Khambalia went on to say: “We have
been extremely happy in the three
years we’ve been at the College and
feel [like we are] part of the commu-
nity. I can proudly say [that the] ma-
jority if not all of our customers have
been thoroughly happy with our ser-
vice. This has been apparent with all
the support we have already received
from people, including the petition
and writing to Sir [Keith] O’Nions
[President & Rector of Imperial Col-
lege London]. We will be extremely
sad to leave the College.”
