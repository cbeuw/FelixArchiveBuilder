Apple iOS7
Max Eggl coos over iPhone’s latest mobile OS
FRIDAY 14 JUNE 33
pple has ﬁnally caught
up with the rest of the
mobile OS world. The
keynote at WWDC has
revealed a slew of new
features, and yours truly has access to
the beta to test them out for you, my
dear reader. A little disclaimer, since
I only have beta access, my experi-
ence may not be the same as the ﬁnal
product. I found that the music app is
quite buggy, crashing several times.
However, all in all, the beta is already
quite smooth, with very few major
problems. Now to the actual review.
Keep in mind I will only be reviewing
things I myself used on a major basis
and found important.
Design
All previous iOS versions, right from
the very start, were dripping with
skeuomorphism (i.e. making pro-
grams look like their real life equiva-
lents – for example, notes looks like a
yellow notepad) a favourite of ex-de-
sign chief Scott Forstall. But when he
was ﬁred, and Sir Jonny Ive installed
in his stead, a lot of critics hoped for
a more updated look in iOS 7. Ive,
an award winning designer, who was
previously solely in charge of the hard-
ware design, was, and still is a known
lover of simplicity, straight lines and a
“ﬂat” look as is exhibited in the iMac,
iPhone etc. Therefore, the consensus
on the internet was that Ive would try
to apply this approach to the software
that ran the devices he designed. And,
boy, did he deliver. Right from the
loading screen his inﬂuence is felt, all
the way to the absence of the felt tex-
ture of the folders. However this just
feels “right”. Apple device’s futuristic
look clashed with the green felt and
faux leather of previous software it-
erations.
The new lock screen just emphasises
the beauty of the retina display, with
no more grey bars in the way. Then
when the lock screen gives way to the
home screen, the animation looks just
(sorry for the cliché) awesome. The
new designs of the app icons, without
the shadowing, are just great to look

when
confidence
in Apple has
been failing,
they have
released a
much needed
boost
at and much more modern. An added
touch that does speak volumes of Ive’s
creativity and attention to detail is the
opaqueness of various messages and
screens. This means that your home/
lockscreen really aﬀect the look of
your phone as the colours do really
bleed through. There is so much more
I could tell you about the new design,
however I would run out of space and
time, so I apologize if I forgot any new
design features. However the last thing
I have to mention and also the thing
that impressed me the most (I know,
easily entertained), was the funky 3-D
thing. My backscreen that moved de-
pending on my viewing angle was just
great! That touch was just something I
found to be absolutely stunning, and
the ﬁrst thing everyone asked to see.
One con I just wanted to utter was
that I found that when I ﬁrst saw the
actual icons, while nice, I thought that
the added colour palette did make it
feel a bit less serious. However I guess
that was just the new experience of it
all.
All in all the design is exactly what
Apple needed to do and is a great way
to start oﬀ the Jonny Ive era.
Utilities
There are several things that Apple
has ﬁnally implemented features that
the world had already a long time ago
including a more eﬃcient multitask-
ing, notiﬁcation center, control center,
a new camera app as well as air drop.

whe
Firstly lets talk about the multitasking,
in fact it’s directly stolen from Win-
dows 8. However it just looks great in
iOS 7, and works perfectly. The swip-
ing up to quit apps is just divine and
much more intuitive than tapping the
red cross. The notiﬁcation center has
been revamped in iOS 7, getting rid of
the fake texture, introducing, in black
and white, diﬀerent sections for “to-
day”, “overall” and “missed”, that should
ﬁnally (hopefully) add some actual use
to the notiﬁcation center. Till now it
hasn’t really done much for me. Next
on the agenda is the control center.
This feature, directly stolen from an-
droid, is something that apple users
have cried for for a long time. Directly
swiping up on your phone brings up a
mini settings area where you can eas-
ily turn wiﬁ, bluetooth, screen lock
etc. on and oﬀ, and aids you in avoid-
ing the cluttered and complex settings
app. This a great addition to iOS 7 and
one of the reasons I decided to update
early. Lastly we have the camera and
air drop. The camera has been totally
redesigned, and now, is just a dream to
use. Instead of having to ﬂick a switch,
or go into the settings to change cam-
era mode, you just ﬂick from mode to
mode. Also Apple have now hipster-
ized the app with diﬀerent ﬁlters, so
for all ya’ll instagrammers out there
will certainly enjoy this. Lastly the air
drop. This feature seems sick! The idea
that I can instantly exchange ﬁles over
wiﬁ is great, however at this point I
A
couldn’t ﬁnd anyone to do an iPhone
to iPhone transfer, so future updates
on that.
Conclusion
This is the update that iOS really need-
ed. At a time when conﬁdence in Ap-
ple has been failing, they have released
a much needed boost. It has given the
ageing system a new look while re-
maining true to the iOS roots. The
features are poignant and are what is
needed to keep iOS competitive.
