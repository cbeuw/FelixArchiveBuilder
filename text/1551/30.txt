When listening to those words in the
title immediately we all think of de-
serted cities with one main road, as
these places were presented in the
Western movies. This might be true
for some places, though this article
will present some nature’s most fa-
mous creations, namely the Canyons
and the national parks within which
they are located.
Yes, most of you I am sure know
about the Grand Canyon, that is why
I am going to omit it from this article,
and will try to shed some light to those
least known ones, which I truly ad-
mired on my trip there.
The US states where most of these
canyons can be found are Arizona,
Utah and Nevada. The ﬁrst one I am
going to mention is Bryce Canyon lo-
cated in Utah within the Kodachrome
State Park. At this canyon one has the
opportunity to stay within the State
Park in the so called “Red Stone” Cab-
ins. You can then admire the magni-
tude of this canyon throughout dif-
ferent times of the day and notice the
change in the colour of the rocks. One
can walk through the diﬀerent desig-
nated paths to understand what this
place has to oﬀer and admire what
nature has created, and see something
that is still pretty un-inﬂuenced from
humans. The scenery is truly majestic.

TO THE FAR
WEST AND
BEYOND
I am not particularly fond of adventure
trips, but this place brought out a dif-
ferent site of me.
The next one on my list is Zion Na-
tional Park, also located in Utah, which
is one of the longest canyons covering
a distance of 24 km. The rangers in the
park have organised buses that take
you from the visitor center to the end
of the trail at the so called “Temple of
Sinawava”. At each stop along the way
one can get oﬀ the bus and follow the
designated trails to experience nature’s
magnitude ﬁrst hand. This canyon is
the easiest one to reach and explore,
especially for a beginner hiker.
The ﬁnal canyon that has literally
blown my mind is the “Antelope Can-
yon”, located in Page Arizona. What is
striking about this canyon is that it is
located under the ground. One can en-
ter this canyon only with a guide, who
also explains how it was created and
tries to really integrate you into the
scenery. Truth is this canyon is com-
pletely diﬀerent any other canyon that
I have visitied, and is worth a look.
Words really fail me when describing
this canyon; I think for once I will let
pictures speak for themselves.
In these places don’t expect to ﬁnd
extreme luxuries, but expect to be
amazed by nature’s luxuries. If you
want to escape the humdrum of eve-
ryday hectic life, then these places are
ideal for you and for your hidden ad-
venturous site…
