This week you try to get your
5 a day. You stock up on fruit
and veg and start the day
with a banana. You move on
to a courgette, then some
light relief with a few aspara-
gus tips. You continue with a
carrot then squeeze in a kiwi
before bedtime. Your anus
feels healthy and satisfied.
Fruit is so underrated!
This week you spaff all over
your exam script. Instead
of meaningful answers, you
splatter your own natural paint
all over your blank canvas. A
picture says 1000 words, and
your creation is true art. It’s
just a shame that your distri-
bution of a few sticky blobs
doesn’t relate to the mark
scheme. Enjoy your retakes!
This week you turn the Rec-
tor on with your big Babylon.
Scale model of the ancient
city of Babylon that is. He’s
really impressed by the de-
tailing in the palm trees and
suggests that you sculpt Im-
perial on a similar scale. “We
could have a lot of fun with a
model of Queen’s Tower”, he
purrs.
This week all your bones dis-
solve and you become a mass
of wobbling skin on the floor.
At least you can lick your own
genitals now, but it’s little con-
solation when you consider
that you will have to be trans-
ported around in a wheelbar-
row. Also, your eyeballs will rub
against your nipples and be
engulfed by folds of neck. Pint?
This week you transform into
a spider from the waist down.
Having 8 legs is kind of weird
but you soon begin to enjoy
the bristly feeling against
your peachy skin. You can
also try so many more excit-
ing sex positions now you
can stick to the wall… If you
can find anyone who’s into
that sort of thing.
This week your partner says it’s
time to take your relationship
to a new dimension. However
you are not sure whether this
dimension is spatial or tem-
poral so are unsure of how to
react. You buy a time machine
but panic and accidently send
yourselves back 3 billion years.
You melt into a primordial soup
together – so romantic.
This week you develop an ear
fetish. You just can’t stop think-
ing about sticking your penis
in other people’s waxy ears,
and pounding against their
tympanic membrane until your
cum flows down the Eustachi-
an tube. And oh how you long
to nestle your balls amongst
the complex curves of the pin-
na! Any hole is a goal…
This week you are sick of eat-
ing baked beans. But it’s all
you have so you try a fresh
new way to ingest them:
snorting. You mash ‘em and
sniff like there’s no tomorrow.
But sadly the permeability of
your nostrils does not extend
to legumes; the bean puree
gets stuck in your windpipe
and you choke to death.
This week you have worms
but are really constipated
so they start wriggling out
through your belly button to
escape. You sew up the hole
to stop them but they just
keep breeding in your intes-
tines and eventually so much
pressure builds up that they
burst through your stomach
and your vagina.
This week, you ‘re not sure
whether your viva examiner is
winkingatyouorjusthasaneye
twitch. You’ve been in revision-
induced isolation for so long
that any attention is welcome
and you find yourself strangely
aroused. You wink suggestively
back but turns out he has hay-
fever and thinks you’re making
fun of him. Awkward.
This week you think you’ve
finished exams. You swagger
round the library smirking at all
the people still revising until you
see someone on your course.
You ask them why they’re still
revising. They frown and point
to page 2 of the exam time-
table. Shit, you thought there
was only one page and you still
have 10 exams left.
This week you must choose
between having your mouth
permanently crammed with
slugs or a cactus up your bum.
Slugs would be less painful,
they’d put off potential sexual
partners and you’d never be
able to enjoy cheezeburgers
again. The cactus would mean
a life of excruciating anal haem-
orrhage. What’s it going to be?
