This afternoon the NUS was once
again attempting to reform itself, at
an extraordinary conference in Wol-
verhampton. In contrast to last year’s
extraordinary conference, it appears
to have been a very civilised affair,
although a number of changes went
through. Conference eventually voted
in favour of the revised reform propos-
als by 614 votes to 142, easily meeting
the 2/3 majority needed to change the
constitution.
The decision must be ratified at a
second conference, either a further Ex-
traordinary Conference or at Annual
Conference in April. In either case, Im-
perial will play no further part in the
process due to our disaffiliation.
The reforms originally eased the
requirements for delegates to Annual
Conference to be elected by cross-
campus ballot, however this has been
reversed. Proposals to allow elected
officers - who typically receive many
times the number of votes of NUS
delegates - to automatically qualify for
conference failed to pass.
The controversial Trustee Board re-
mains intact, with the Black Students
campaign failing in its attempt to have
an automatic seat for all liberation
campaigns on the supposedly apoliti-
cal board. The board’s function is to
ensure the NUS remains financially vi-
able and acts within the law, which led
to concerns that it could simply throw
out anything it did not like. This was
clarified, with the Annual Conference
able to refer items back to the Trustee
Board if it disagrees with their decision.
A proposal to remove external trustees
was also defeated, meaning the ‘safety
net’ committee will be recruiting from
outside the student movement.
Attempts by far left groups to kill off
the talk of reform once and for all were
rejected again, along with a number
of other amendments. A proposal to
force conference delegations to be 50%
female was thrown out - the amend-
ment noted that over 50% of students
are women, but the same does not ap-
ply to conference delegations. It should
be noted that despite Imperial’s gender
imbalance, the last conference delega-
tion was almost a 50/50 split.
One other amendment of note aimed
to stop ratification of the reforms oc-
curring at a second extraordinary con-
ference, instead requiring that the An-
nual Conference be the one to approve
the changes. However, this was also
rejected, fuelling speculation that re-
forms will be ‘forced through’ by hold-
ing an additional extraordinary confer-
ence, for which delegates do not need
to be selected by cross-campus ballot.
Reports from Imperial’s delegates in-
dicate it was a civilised affair, and the
margin by which the reforms passed
is more convincing than the last
attempt.
NUS vote for reform again Universities to be
restructured?
Universities face the prospect of radi-
cal changes after a review ordered by
the Government. In his report, Paul
Ramsden, chief executive of the Higher
Education Academy, said that universi-
ties should no longer class degrees as
firsts, 2:1s, 2:2s or thirds. Instead they
should issue report cards.
“The present system of classifica-
tion was designed for a smaller higher
education world,” he said. “It does not
describe the range of knowledge, skills,
experience and attributes of a graduate
in the 21st century.”
“It reduces the complexity of a gradu-
ate’s performance to a single category.
And it is not reliable across different
subject areas.”
In another report, Drummond Bone,
Vice-Chancellor of Liverpool Univer-
sity, said that British universities faced
growing competition abroad, and that
the credit crunch had made distance
learning programmes more popular.
“The figures for a massive increase in
international education are no longer
tenable,” he said. “The last 13 years
have seen an extraordinary expan-
sion of global trade and an extremely
benign financial environment, neither
of which can be relied upon in the
future.”
Professor Bone said that universities
needed to broaden their perspective
on overseas work, perhaps by build-
ing campuses abroad. This is an area in
which US universities have been active,
particularly in the Middle East.
Imperial College have already set-
up several oversea parterships, one of
which was reported in last weeks issue
of felix (Issue 1,414).

Imperial Canoe Club to the rescue
Members of Imperial College Union
Canoe Club were involved in the rescue
of a canoeist from a Snowdonian river
last Sunday. The individual was swept
down the river before he managed to
climb onto a rock just before Conwy
Falls, near Betws y Coed, Gwynedd.
The individual in question was ca-
noeing earlier that day with ICU Canoe
Club, but is not a member of Imperial.
IC Canoe Club were on their weekend
trip with a large cohort of beginners in
Wales, with the aim of the event be-
ing to introduce them to the basics of
canoeing.
The River Conwy can effectively be
split up into three separate sections,
each of varying difficulty. The first sec-
tion of the river is described as very
easy, with the next two sections getting
progressively harder. The final stretch
of the river is considered a grade 5 and
should only be attempted by very expe-

rienced canoeists.
It was as ICU Canoe Club were get-
ting ready to tackle the water that
they bumped into the individual who
turned out to be a friend of one of
the members. The individual, age 20,
joined the group as they went down
the river, however since the group was
full of a lot of beginners, it took longer
than expected and the individual went
on the do the next section alone, which
is considered to be unwise, as he had to
meet a friend.
With all the beginners safely taken
out of their boats, the more experi-
enced went on to tackle the second
section of the river. This was not with-
out it’s own incidents, as one of the
Imperial canoeists managed to capsize
his boat and had to evacuate it. Due to
the fairly strong current, the boat was
taken away and after the IC students
ensured that the canoeist was safe,
they began the search for the boat.
After a while, the boat was found
wedged between two rocks, and the
members present radioed the rest of
the group to come with more safety
equipment to rescue the boat.
It was at this point that the Impe-
rial canoeists were informed that the
individual that went on ahead never
turned up. Assuming that he must
have missed the exit point, the group
went down to the third stretch of the
river where they found him stranded
on ‘The Rock’. This particular rock has
received it’s name as it is the last large
rock in the river before Conwy Falls, a
30-40 ft drop.
Boaters from the nearby café were
akready at the scene, but didn’t have
enough safety equipment with them.
At this point, Tom Haywood from
Imperial College Union Canoe Club,
called the minibus to bring down the
safety equipment that they had with
them. Rory Fyffe, President of Impe-
rial College Union Canoe Club, then
managed to organise his club to con-
tact the emergency services and give
their current location. In the mean-
time, the older members of the club
secured a line and got the individual
to a safe location. Due to the nature of
the river and the steep cliff faces on ei-
ther side, the members of ICU Canoe
Club could only get the individual to a
certain point where it was considered
very unlikely for him to get back into
the water.
The Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue
team and the Betws y Coed fire service
then arrived on the scene and managed
to get the individual to safety. Rescuer
Chris Lloyd from the Ogwen Valley
Mountain Rescue Organisation told
BBC Wales that “This kind of rescue
is a regular occurrence on this stretch
of river, and we get called out three to
four times every year.”
It was later found out that the indi-
vidual had missed the exit point after
the second stretch of the river, and
after seeing a stretch of the river that
he didn’t like, he decided to portage
(get out and walk down the bank). He
then managed to drop the canoe in the
IC Canoe Club aid canoeist stranded on a rock above a
waterfall whilst attempting to recover his canoe
water and decided to jump in after it.
At this point the rapids took the indi-
vidual downstream until he managed
to cling onto ‘The Rock’ where he was
later found.
The rescue services praised Imperial
College Canoe Club for their contribu-
tion to the rescue attempt, as well as
receiving a lot of gratitude from the
individual involved. The reaction to
the events last Sunday can best be de-
scribed by the email Rory Fyffe, Presi-
dent of Imperial College Union Canoe
Club, sent to the members.
“Given the events of this weekend I
wanted to email you all. Firstly to thank
you all for your help, level-headedness
and patience last night. I was greatly
pleased by the way the whole club re-
acted. Especially those for which this
was their first ever kayaking trip.”
“The team-work, initiative, sensitiv-
ity, professionalism and assumption of
responsibility displayed last night was
excellent and illustrates what a strong
club we have this year. The emergency
services and the couple involved send
their thanks also.”
Students develop bacterial machines to build
three-dimensional structures
A team of Imperial College bioscien-
tists are taking on other universities
from around the world in the Inter-
national Genetically Engineered Ma-
chines (iGEM) competition at the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology.
The annual event, of which Imperial
have taken a mixed team of undergrad-
uates and postgraduates to for the past
three years, is a celebration of student’s
work and research within synthetic
biology.
This year’s team consist of nine un-
dergraduates from different bioscience
departments, four advisors and two
professors. The concept they are taking
with them to the States involves turn-
ing harmless bacteria, Bacillus Subtilis
into efficient biofabricators.
The hope is that the bacteria will be
able to produce self assembling or-
ganic compounds, such as cellulose,
on demand.
Krupa Hirani, a third year Bioengi-
neer, is a team member currently in
Massachussetts, and explained briefly
how their concept would work.
“We have designed a system where
large numbers of bacteria would be
swimming around normally in the lab
until a blue light is shone onto them in
a particular shape,” she says. “The bac-
teria in the blue light would then stop
swimming around and produce a ma-
terial, which would self-assemble into
the pre-designed shape created by the
blue light.”
The pre-determined pattern would
be similar to a 3D component of a knit-
ted structure, and be used in different
applications across the field, including
producing biodegradable clothes and
synthetic tissue scaffolds.
One of the team leaders, Dr. Paul
Freemont was in a buoyant mood prior
to the American trip, commenting “An
awful lot of effort and hours in the lab
have gone into characterising Bacil-
lus Subtilis and planning the genetic
manipulations necessary to transform
these organisms from innocuous soil
bacteria to biological manufacturing
units.”
“Our team’s work is an example of a
pioneering use of a new bacteria as a
biological manufacturing unit and I’m
lookingforwardtosharingourachieve-
ments with other university teams.”
The team will return back this week,
hopefully triumphantly, but otherwise
they should not be disappointed in
their achievements they have worked
on since July.
These are exciting times for bio-
sciences and bioengineering; both
fully taking stock of the great advances
in medical technology and the ever-
increasing demand for ecological and
organic manufacture.

A report by Universities UK, which
represents vice-chancellors said: “It is
simply naive to suppose that UK uni-
versities can operate effectively and
compete with emerging global giants
while funding remains at about one
third of US levels. By 2023, a signifi-
cant proportion of higher education
may be delivered by further education
colleges, private and international pro-
viders. The challenge for institutions
will be to ensure that the UK retains its
reputation for quality and excellence,
and that diversity and differentiation
do not lead to incoherence within the
sector.”
Predicted demographic changes over
the next decade should prompt fairer
policies for part-time students, it said,
as there will be fewer full-time, teenage
undergraduates.
One of the key points from the report
were that more postgraduate schol-
arships are needed to stop the “brain
drain”, by which they mean that would
like to prevent students moving away
from academia.
The reviews outline that there clearly
is a problem with the current state of
higher education in the United King-
dom. These problems have also been
outlined by the Minister for Higher
Education, David Lammy (Issue 1,413).
Imperial College have also recognised
that the current state is not ideal, and
it was announced by Sir Roy Anderson
that Imperial would be introducing
new entrance exams by 2010.
Earlier this year, second year stu-
dents took part in a trial run of the ex-
ams that the new students would have
to take, however feedback from the
tests have so far been negative. felix
will report back on the full story in the
near future.
