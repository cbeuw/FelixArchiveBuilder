Two football teams from Imperial Col-
lege squared up against each other last
Saturday. The IC 7’s were up against
literally the best eleven players in the
Royal School of Mines but Cletus,
Wayne and the rest of the inbred hick
Geologists were no match for the might
and intelligence of the IC boys.
RSM even called on their primitive
knowledge of nature, using wind, fire
(the sun), and rain in a vain attempt
to get the upper hand. Initially it paid
off as the IC boys, captained by James
Brown, struggled to get the ball down
and play the brand of football for which
they are famed and the RSM used their
brute strength to force an opener. The
game started poorly and the ball was
stuck in midfield but with the wind be-
hind them and the sun in the eyes of
the IC boys, RSM pressed on winning a
succession of corners and throw ins.
Fromaninswingingcornerabouthalf
an hour in, they broke the deadlock.
The dangerous corner was dipping into
the front post and was palmed back
out to the corner taker by Goalkeeper
Ed Hughes, who, hassled by Greg “wild
west” Tainter found an unmarked,
web-footed team mate at the near post
who powered the ball towards the bot-
tom corner only for Brown, intent on
getting himself up and running in fan-
tasy football, lifted it high into the roof
of his own net, 1-0 RSM.
But this only seemed to gee up the
IC boys and they started to get the
ball down, Ryan Wilson gave their left
back a torrid afternoon, twisting this
way and that and he set up the equal-
iser. Having found space, Wilson slid
in Mike Turrell, who, surprised by the
lack of a very willing offside flag, calm-
ly rounded the Goalkeeper and stroked
the ball calmly into the empty net.
IC pressed on and Luca Laraia and
Turrell were frequently put through
only to be denied by the RSM captain
(i.e. the one who was literate) running
the line. The midfield duo of Rory “De-
lap” Fleming and Alvin “the chipmunk”
Chan started to dominate the centre
of the park and Mo Muwahid on the
left wing was showboating with mixed
results.
Half time seemed to have come at
a bad time for IC as they were clearly
in the ascendancy but they made it
2-1 straight after the restart. Fleming
beat about 20 men and then squared

to Muwahid who cooly slotted home.
Then RSM came back into the game
and could have twice equalised but
for two important saves from Hughes
and good defending from Chris Ten-
nant and Tainter kept them at bay. IC
then ended the game as a contest as
Henry “superman” Balston scored a
bullet diving header from another Wil-
son cross, but later contrived to miss
an open goal. Muwahid tried to score
with an audacious rainbow flick before
Tennant scored the best goal ever.
Picking the ball up at the half way
line Tennant hit it first time over the
gigantic goalkeeper to score a ridicu-
lous goal and was mobbed by his team
mates accordingly. IC saw out the rest
of the game although substitute Xavier
Scott probably destroyed their left back
with his superior intellect.
Full time, 4-1. Oh and Mit Patel
played and did some throw-ins or
something.

On paper, this fixture was going to
be the toughest of our season so far.
Both teams were sitting joint top of the
league, having played three and won
three. Superb performances recently
against LSE (14-3) and Reading (15-2)
meant that we were going into this
match on a high.
The day started with some anxi-
ety due to confusion over our line-up.
Eventually with the team assembled,
we set off only to find that a long jour-
ney awaited us.
When we finally reached the stun-
ning Brunel sports facilities, we were
slightly disappointed to find that our
match was to be played in a less-than-
ideal dance studio with an incredibly
slippery wooden floor.
Having informed us that they had in-
tended to start at 1.30pm, (even though
some of us did not finish lectures until
12.30, before having to travel for over
an hour!) the Brunel team forced us
to start the matches, barely giving us
enough time to hit a ball, let alone
warm up.
As a result of this we started slowly,
however we certainly kept up with our
title rivals. In fact after our first four
matches we led 3-1, thanks to a fan-
tastic win by Eddie Liu over Brunel’s
Number 1, eventually taking it 11-6 in
the final game.
The next 4 matches also went to us
3-1, meaning that we had taken a very
encouraging 6-2 lead at the halfway
stage.
Eddie Liu continued his winning
ways, going on to take all four of his
singles matches and providing a strong
foundation for what seemed like it was
going to be an IC win.
The match took a twist when
Brunel’s Number 4 rallied to beat both
Heng-Kai Lee and Yan (our new-found
‘consistency man’) with some ferocious
attacking table tennis. Unfortunately
I went down to Brunel’s Number 1 in
a very tight match, losing 12-10 in the
final game.
With the score standing at 8-6 to IC
with three matches left we were in-
formed that play could not continue
as our hosts had only booked the hall
until 5.00pm. Chaos ensued.
Our opponents seemed to suggest
that the remaining three matches
should be forfeited to them, as it was
our team who had arrived late (thus
conveniently enabling them to win the
tie 8-9).
We as a team felt very hard done
by, especially seeing as Brunel chose
only to use two tables for matches, in
a space not too dissimilar to our own
in Ethos where we use at least three.
When I, as acting captain refused to
sign the scorecard, I was confronted by
a member of the opposition in a some-
what aggressive manner.
Eventually both teams agreed to
let the score remain as it was at 8-6
and leave the decision up to higher
powers.
Our next fixture sees us take on bot-
tom of the league Middlesex University
in what should hopefully be a comfort-
able victory. Once again thanks and
congratulations go to the team for a
very spirited performance.

‘Can you get that van to go faster?
James wants to go faster’ Not really the
sort of thing you want to hear at 9;30
on a Friday night, somewhere on the
M1. The plan didn’t seem quite as fool
proof now. The plan involved a hasty
exit from London in order to get to the
Edale campsite before its 11 o’clock
closing time. Having attended lectures
in somewhat inappropriate footwear
we clipped in and set off for the van
rental place in Notting Hill. After a
quick cruise across Hyde Park, and a
regroup in the pub we loaded up the
van and got ready to go. All we needed
was Nathan to arrive and we would be
off. Things were looking rosy. Then a
phone call was made containing the
words ‘derailleur’ and ‘Upside down’.
To cut a long story short, the lights of
Edale appeared through the van wind-
screen with 15 minutes to spare.
And so Saturday dawned well, wet
and cold to be honest, but we had come
a long way, and I was determined to
show the guys what ‘proper’ northern
trails where about. After a quick spin
along the road, we hit the first climb
and ascended to the top of the Beast,
a twisting ribbon of wet rock dropping
down to the Snake Pass road. Things
started off in a relaxed fashion, the
faster kids boosting of the rocky out-
crops that covered the trail. However,
it was only in the trees where things got
interesting. The fast kids had stopped.
‘Is it down there?’ Being the ‘local’ I
dropped in first. You don’t get this kind
of trail within a train ride of Imperial.
Just a rocky, slabbed, greasy, drop off
laden mess. I loved it.
The rocks eased a little and despite a
gritty climb, we where soon bombing
down steep singletrack, with the burg-
er van lunch stop in sight. The final
flagstone descent tested people’s faith
in their tyres, and ensured everyone
had earned their lunch. Carbed up, the
penultimate climb was despatched at
an epic pace by Roger, evidently there
was something in his bacon sandwich.
A broken chain in the rain at the top
didn’t dampen spirits, aided by the dis-
covery of that weeks Felix amongst the
spare tubes in my bag. Chain repaired,
and Imperial issues digested we set off
on a naturally bermed, rock-laden de-
scent back down to Snake Pass.
The revelation that we would have to
carry/push our bikes back up the Beast
led to a fairly grumpy half hour, al-
though things where quickly righted on
the final drop. With a gradient that just
urged you to go faster, and ample op-
portunity for air time there were smiles
all round at the bottom. We changed
out of riding gear and decamped to
the pub. After 40 km and over 1000
meters of ascent and descent, drinks
and much Yorkshire pudding-based
scoff felt deserved. Usefully some doc-
tors at the bar also diagnosed Dave T’s
massively swollen hand from an ear-
lier crash. Wouldn’t get that in London
would you, eh?
Sunday dawned grim to say the least.
After much deliberation over a some-
what calorific breakfast we decided to
head up the road to the top of the valley
and hit up the singletrack descent back
down. After half an hour of winch-
ing up the murderous 1 in 5 gradient
we hit the sodden dirt and contoured
up to the top of Rushup Edge. More
sketchy flagstones lead to the where
the singletrack dropped off the ridge.
Once again I dropped in first, and im-
mediately scored the weekend’s most
hilarious crash. Despite this inauspi-
cious start, the trail was a beauty, al-
ternating between gnarly rock gardens
and rutted greasy singletrack. Stopping
half way down I perfected my 180 skid/
crash routine.
The trail was so good we decided
that despite swollen hands, painful
knees and the odd bit of dented pride it
was worth hitting up once more before
heading back to the big smoke. An hour
or so later, caked in Derbyshire dirt, we
rolled into Edale for the final time. For
a weekend riding I reckon it had it all;
Rocky gnar, sweet singletrack, shitty
weather and a few good stories for the
pub, I just hope it isn’t the end of your
mountain bike career, Nathan. We sure
did throw you in at the deep end.

Mr. B Nose
Are there too
many teams?
S
o RSM have one week of glo-
ry and then the lowest ranked
IC football team demolishes
them. Are the faculty sports
teams really still neccessary?
Why is it that we have multiple teams
in football, hockey, rugby and more.
We can still have our yearly inter-fac-
ulty competitions where we can stand
up for the traditions of the engineer/
scientist/miner.
On my last count there were 13 football
teams, 12 rugby teams and 13 hockey
teams! They would all consider them-
self under the banner of Imperial Col-
lege and so why not compete together?
Why are faculty unions attemting to
start up new sports clubs for an annual
piss up and match against the guys in
the building opposite? The union fund-
ing is stretched enough as it is.
‘13 football
teams, 12 rugby
teams and 13
hockey teams!’
People play their sport for different
reasons. Some for the social aspect,
some for a highly competitive match
every week, and from my experience
the bigger clubs provide both. The ar-
guement that ‘I play RSM for the social
side’ is bollocks. I play 1st XI hockey
for the social side...I just happen to be
good enough to be there! This could all
be taken one step further. God forbid
it happens in my time at Imperial, but
why do IC compete against the Med-
ics. Don’t quote me on this, but they
are not half bad at most sports and if
they combined with the IC teams we
would not only have huge clubs but
also a chance to make the social and
standard immense.
This may solve the problem I ad-
dressed last week - we cannot sustain
any teams in the current format at the
highest level. There is huge amounts of
funding, first class facilities, top notch
coaching and a university that has its
highest student population of all time.
A very simple, but maybe contraver-
sial , mix up of the format of IC teams
could proove to be the answer, Let me
know your views...!
In other news we have the cycling
club who managed to to put a smile
on our face with their publicity stunt
with a copy of felix. Nice. There will be
a prize of the best felix photo...it may
be a pint or two!
Coming up next week we have the
next round of BUCS matches where
most teams have a sturn test ahead
of them. Fencing and Volleyball have
tournements to compete in and the
new BUCS set up seems to be pro-
viding all us sportspeople with all the
competition we need.
Finally I am going to cry out once
again for photos of high resolution
and reports to accompany them. If you
have not got much to say then just give
me some highlights to include in this
column...this is your newspaper and
so give us something to publish. Good
luck!
