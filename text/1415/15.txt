The winner of Slitherlink 1,413 was
Top of the Table. Congratulations on
winning two puzzles. Ninja’s can’t even
catch you right now. Please keep enter-
ing. We’ll give a prize out in the sum-
mer. It’ll be good. Almost too good.
How to play:
Crudely speaking, Slitherlink is similar
to Minesweeper mixed with a dash of
Sudoku.
The object of the game is to draw
lines between the dots to create one
long, and most importantly, looping
line. It should have no start or finish;
just like an elastic band.
Each number indicates how many
lines should be drawn around it, for
example:
Cells which don’t contain a number
can be surrounded by any number of
lines.
Remember, the line must form a
loop, so the line cannot branch. The
following situations are not allowed:
Squares are not allowed either. There
are never cells containing the number
4 in Slitherlink.
So, where do you start? The most
common place to start on a Slitherlink
grid is by drawing crosses around any
zeros. Drawing crosses is purely done
to so that you know where there can’t
possibly be a line. So, take the pattern
below as an example. Begin by drawing
crosses, then by filling in some lines:
Now the lines can only continue in the
following directions:

Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers with
letters. Once you’ve completed
the puzzle, there is a hidden word
to find. Email answers to sudoku.

Oh Hai! These promises of iPods
have ensured that there’s stiff
competition, as apposed to no
competition which we previously
had. Anyhoo the winner was
‘Top of the Table’ who found
BRUTALSEX. Trust me, it’s fun.
Dear Tamara
I think I’m going through my mid-life
crisis! My mood is up and down faster
than an excited electron and I have no
idea why! It’s beginning to affect all as-
pects of my life and I don’t know how
to deal with it! Please help me before I
completely lose the plot!
Rollercoaster Baby
Dear Rollercoaster Baby,
Calling it a mid-life crisis is a tad
melodramatic, don’t you think? Per-
haps when you start losing your rag at
someone who bumps you in the tube
station accidentally you should pause
a second and think about whether this
is a fight you are likely to win. There’s
no point getting into conflict unless
you’re sure you’ll come out as the win-
ner. If you’re generally feeling the in-
evitable midterm stress and wondering
how on Earth we ended up mid No-
vember when Freshers’ week was only
last week then perhaps you should take
some time to pamper yourself a bit. I
don’t necessarily mean the facial and
manicure type of pampering but why
not get your arse off the sofa and get to
Ethos – exercise it the best way to de-
stress. Apparently, drinking and junk
food also affect your mental condition
but I’m not sure that kind of gruesome
sacrifice is entirely justified.
Dear Tamara,
I can’t stay awake in lectures! I’ve tried
everything – biting the back of my hand,
stabbing it with a sharp pencil. Nothing
works. As soon as the lights dim for the
powerpoint slides my eyes my eyes fall
shut. Is there anything I can do?
Eyes wide shut
Dear Eyes wide shut,
Less hanky panky at night would be
good, then you wouldn’t be so tired.
You could develop a crush on someone
in the lecture theatre and then you’d
be too preoccupied with pulling sexy
facial expressions to think about sleep.
On the other hand, what difference
does it make if you nap anyway? No
one listens to the words in a lecture so
you may as well nap while the lecturer
fills a board and then copy it down.
Next board – next nap. It’ll help avoid
those pesky eye bags. You can combine
the two and fall asleep on your crush’s
shoulder for maximum effect.
Dear Tamara,
I signed up to rowing in my Freshers’
week and now I can’t be bothered to get
out of bed and drag myself all the way
to the boat house. I’ll just end up sit-
ting in a cold wet boat with other half
dressed boys and that doesn’t really ap-
peal to me before the sun is even up.
Lazy Boatman
Dear Lazy Boatman
What can I say? Pull your finger out.
Dear Tamara,
At home I used to live far away from
school and my home life and school life
were very separate. At uni, I’m in Beit
and all my friends come to my room
after lectures and hang out all night
there. I love my newfound friends but
I need some time to be alone and pluck
my eyebrows and things! Aargh!
Crowded
Dear Crowded,
Why not just politely tell your friends
to get the fuck out of your room be-
cause you need some space? Unless
they’re complete idiots, they’ll under-
stand and move their procrastinating a
few metres away to the union . If they
are idiots then why are you freinds with
them in the first place? Pity? You could
of course come up with a cunning plan
involving a contagious airborne illness
so they will avoid your room but I reck-
on the honest approach is best.
Dear Tamara,
Should I spend my money on going to
Fabric or on food? Eating is important
but partying is even more so. That’s
what I’m here for after all.
What do you think?
Starving Party-Boy
Dear Starving Party-Boy
Food will only make you fat and no-
body likes a porker – whatever chance
you once had of pulling will be lost.
On the other hand – going out is your
best bet on finding a girl willing to ac-
company you to your room so you can
show her your collection of C++ codes.
You will get laid and you will be happy.
Easiest problem I’ve ever had!

Guys, the gym is
the place to go if
you want to check
out some ass. You
can gently pedal
away on the cycle
machine whilst there is a whole host of ass
right in front of you. They even line them up,
how thoughtful is that of Ethos? Those bros
know how to handle their hoes. However once
they turn round... all that sweat, nah so good.
Anyway you probably look shite too.
Scorpio
Word Up my
Scorpio bitches!!
This week it’s my
birthday, that means
people you don’t
know will ring you
up, people you don’t like will buy you a pint
and people you do know and like will buy a
horrific dirty pint. Why? I don’t really want
either of these things- I want to sit in the
corner, shake my fist at the young generation
and chunder into a Biffa bin on the way home.
Libra
Anyone been to
union recently? No
didn’t think so, why?
Well I only have 11
lines here so I’ll just
bring up the major
one. Did you know that when the fosters barrel
runs low and the ever helpful barstaff say that
they are off to change it, they don’t. What
actually happens is that they top it up with a
bit of homebrew, i.e. piss. (Alledgely. Ed)
Sagittarius
Today you spend
£200 on cock crush-
ing skinny jeans
thinking you’ll look
less of a twat. Un-
fortunatly for you,
you’re wrong. In a fit of rage you douse them
in petrol (BP Ultimate 102) and set fire to
them... But you emo image will be lost without
them. Quick as a flash you whip out your cock
and piss on them. You burn your cock and
have to go to Hospital. It’ll be a bad week.
Capricorn
I need to apologise
all the Capricorn
Crew out there.
Your Horoscope is
the last one in the
mixer and by now
I’m completly out of ideas and well up for a
pint. Or 10. But really if you want to do your
own please feel free to write in to felix at the
usual address- it’ll save me about 30 minutes-
yes that is how much effort this took. Pint?
Cancer
Imperial. We are
supposed to be
intellegent aren’t
we? Then why the
fuck do catering
provide us with
forks to eat our jacket potatoes with that
mealt whilst you eat your lunch? It just so
inconvinent that your fork ends up as bent as
Elton John, have you ever tried to spike your
‘tatoe when all 4 prongs point different ways?
Gemini
I think I am
beginning to love
tube drivers. The
other day on the
District at Earls
Court I heard this,
“Ladies and Gentlemen, I do apologise for the
delay to your service. I know you’re all dying
to get home, unless, of course, you happen to
be married to my ex-wife, in which case you’ll
want to cross over to the Westbound and go in
the opposite direction.”
Leo
Leo, you poor
sods. You now
share something in
common with those
useless arseholes the
Blair family. Or if we
use there stage name, “The Massive Mouth”.
It’s like a fucking circus in that family- one
likes to cut out the middle man and vomit
directly into the waterways and there is an
ageing rockstar in the mix too? Whadafuh?!?
Taurus
This week you sit in
your fluid dynam-
ics lecture trying to
figure out what type
of bellend you have
to be to actually en-
joy this. You look at your HB pencil and curse
the nanny state who forced the powers that be
to remove Lead from pencils. A few licks and
BOOM! lead poising and escape from this hell
hole into the realtive joys of A&E.
Aries
Unfortuantly for you
Aries this week does
not bode well. Years
of stress will finally
push you over the
edge. Yes you will
take performance enhancing drugs... and
by performance enhancing drugs I do mean
Viagra. But don’t use the stuff from the men’s
shithouse in the Union, they don’t work, infact
I’ve have better effects with Smarties.
Pisces
Did you know that
a pint is not actually
1 unit? I went to
the Health Centre
the other day with
a stomach pain and
hope that the nurse was hot (trust me shes
banging) and she ask me “Do you consume
more than 21 units a week?” After pondering
for a bit I replyed “Yer I think I do 21 pints a
week.” To which she said, “No, a pint is not 1
unit. You are going to die.” Oh shit!
Ho-dizzle-ro-tizzle-scopes. Brace yourselves.
Aquarius
You probably want
to skip this one-
it’s an inside joke.
Shipman... what’s
occuring? Really
would you make
sweet love to you ideal girl if you were more
likley to get AIDs than not... 70%, that’s quite
high. If anyone’s as ruthless as this man please
send you story to felix@imperial.ac.uk but
remember it could get messy....
Informal, factual, funny.... Just three things that these Horoscopes won’t be.

ight the, you guys wanted a
quick crossword, so you’ve
got one. Thanks to En-
och for the grid and the
questions.
Don’t worry though everyone, even
though the crossword is done by the
same person who does the cryptic
crosswords, it won’t be as difficult.
Enoch dumbed it really down so that
every can do it, but after being told it
was too easy, he kicked it up a notch.
As every puzzle in the paper, cor-
rect answers bring points which will go
towards the FUCWIT League. So get
your answes in to sudoku.felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk.
Good luck!
