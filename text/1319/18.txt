GREEN & BLACK’S ORGANIC TWISTS
Brand: Green & Black’s
Extras: 4 praline and 4 hazelnut & currant
milk chocolate twists
Total weight: 215g
Price: £5.05
“It may be better for the
environment, but organic chocolate
tastes horrible”
It seems that you either love this egg or hate
it. Someone gave it five stars; someone else
gave it zero. One for the more sophisticated
palette, perhaps?

★★✩✩✩
Welcome to our traditional Easter Egg tast-
ing eggstravaganza (chortle). Eight intrepid
members of the Felix editorial team risked
the dual dangers of vomiting and sugar highs
to bring you the lowdown on this year’s batch
of ovate chocolate delights.
This being FairTrade Fortnight, we attempt-
ed to find a FairTrade Easter egg, but sadly
we tried three different supermarkets without
discovering one. In fact, the first two people
we spoke to at Sainsbury’s didn’t know what
FairTrade was.
Since the content and size of the eggs varies,
we thought it would be useful to let you know
what extra toys or accessories you receive
with each one, and also the weight so you
know how much you’re getting for your money.
The prices given are from Sainsbury’s on
Cromwell Road.
Happy Easter!
AFTER EIGHT
Brand: Nestlé
Extras: 1 small box of After Eight Mints
Total weight: 335g
Price: £4.99
“Not what you’d expect from an
Easter egg. Basically it’s a big mint
in the shape of an egg. Reasonable
taste though”
This was popular with most reviewers, though
some questioned the suitability of changing
the trademark after-dinner mint into an Easter
egg
Official FARCE rating:
★★★★✩
CHOCOLATE ORANGE SEGSATIONS
Brand: Terry’s
Extras: A handful of Segsations chocolates
Total weight: 187g
Price: £1.55
“The unique orange and cocoa
combination makes this egg stand
out from the crowd”
One reviewer recommended testing this egg
for the Sudan 1 food dye, but everyone else
rated it highly. Just beating the Creme Egg
into second place, Terry’s Chocolate Orange
Segsations is this year’s FARCE winner
Official FARCE rating:
★★★★✩
CREME EGG
Brand: Cadbury
Extras: 2 Creme Eggs
Total weight: 195g
Price: £1.55
“Nice and cheap, but for the same
price you could get five Creme Eggs
from the Union shop. Is the big one
worth three?”
Simple but effective, this was our second
favourite overall. Oh, and did I mention you
can get three Creme Eggs for 89p at the
Union shop?
