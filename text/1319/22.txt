ALBUM REVIEWS
The weather is cold and fresh, the
sky is bright and there are some
flurries of snow swirling around my
head. Strangers smile at me in the
street as they scrape ice off their
cars. And Silent Alarm, the debut
album by London art-school types
Bloc Party, is being pumped into
my head by those famous white ear-
phones. It is all too perfect, and
brings a tear to my eye.
This album really is that good. It is
so exciting and forward looking, yet
so “the sound of now”. Whether it’s
observing the interweaving guitar
and vocal harmonies of Helicopter
on MTV2, feeling like you’re hearing
something that shouldn’t see the
light of day for another decade in the
form of the dark, techno-fueled com-
ment on mental illness that is She’s
Hearing Voices, or just plain getting
your groove on down the club to the
thumping Banquet, you cannot, nor
should you want to, avoid Bloc Party.
Any discerning fan of the alternative
music scene will be well aware of
these songs already, so let’s delve
deeper into this album.
Check out Positive Tension, a
sparse and moody song, with spacey
guitar effects squelching around
your head, before guitarist Russel
Lissack goes all Johnny Greenwood
and rocks you into oblivion, as bass-
ist/vocalist Gordon Moakes intones
“success” over and over again. Or
the opener Like Eating Glass, with
those awesome drum rhythms you
usually find in electro songs, vocal-
ist/guitarist Kele Okereke yearn-
ingly yelping “I cant eat I can’t sleep
/ I can’t sleep I can’t dream”, and
you just melt. Price Of Gasoline is
incredibly dense and dark, sounding
like something dredged from the
deepest trench of London’s dirty
new-wave scene (for those in the
know think Lomax).
None of this however can pre-
pare you for their quieter songs.
Many of you will already be familiar
with latest single So Here We Are,
with drummer Matt Tongs post-rock
snare drumming, and the climactic
chorus (when it finally arrives) of
Kele shouting “I’ve figured it out”.
Blue Light is a tender tale of love
lost and coming to terms with it
(“if that’s the way it is, then that’s
the way it is”), with the feeling of a
heart-break resolved being poign-
antly echoed in the music.
But best of all, and probably the
standout track on the album, is
This Modern Love. Kele’s voice is
panned around your head through
light distortion, playing call and
response with himself before gently
begging “baby you’ve got to be more
discerning, I never know what’s
good for me / Baby you’ve got to
be more demanding, I’ll be yours”,
the last phrase sang in breathy har-
mony by the rest of the band. Then
comes military drumming, and a
simple yet moving repeated guitar
riff, with glockenspiel lovingly laid
beneath it. The drumming gradually
becomes more complex as the band
harmoniously sigh beneath Kele as
he sings “This modern love breaks
me / This modern love wastes me.”
The song builds towards the end as
the two guitarists perform the most
restrained guitar sparring ever
heard, and drops right back down to
Kele’s call and response motif.
Despite the fact that this album
is about three songs too long, it
is almost this generation’s OK
Computer (and I’m a huge
Radiohead fan). Unfortunately I
think it will age quickly. The music
scene it emerges from is changing
so rapidly. Fortunately I cannot see
Bloc Party ever getting tied to one
sound, so we will be graced by their
presence for many years to come.
James Millen
Prog-rock! The genre (with its silly
name) is often associated with
impenetrably complex time signa-
tures, stop-start rhythms and split-
ting headaches as a result of both.
Yeah I know, original journalism,
well what do you expect? I’m not
paid to write this crap. OK any-
way, De-loused In The Comatorium
came along a couple of years ago
and everyone went crazy with how
amazing it sounded. It was a com-
pletely indefinable experience, and I
was scared that the follow up would
not even compare in greatness. I lay
awake at night crying at the thought
that they would turn into a rap-reg-
gae band with 12 minute baboon
solos. So now with this, their 5 song
77 minute opus, I am ready to go
through the sleepless nights again
because this album is challenging
and obtuse but ultimately rewarding
and never disappointing.
For those who have little patience,
tolerance and demand immediate
results (in other words, Americans),
beware for this album unravels its
ideas, narrative and purpose slowly
and almost painfully. It is an album
that you will either love or hate, this
partly explains its brilliance as we
all know that universally approved
albums are always bland and hard
to feel passionate about. The psy-
chotic genre hopping and guitar
soloing is a reflection on a colourful
life’s worth of drug abuse, death and
frustration. Some see the obscure
lyrics and awkward music as a way
to obscure their humanity but Omar
and Cedric are intelligent, compli-
cated and challenging individuals.
By reflecting this in the music they
are exposing their true selves and
not a watered-down version.
Opener Cygnus…Vismund
Cygnus, starts with a plaintive
acoustic guitar and characteristic
Cedric croon and out of nowhere, the
guitars and drums enter and sound
unforgiving. There is increased
Latino influence with both the open-
er and L’Via L’Viaquez employ Latin-
American rhythms that drive the
tracks with great swing. After all,
Omar and Cedric said that they’d
rather have people swing their hips
to their music than pogo. The Mars
Volta sound has moved completely
away from At The Drive-In, where
there is no real trace of Fugazi
inspired punk-rock which has lost
all meaning for them and they refer
to it as “jock-rock”.
The album has three facets, the
slow plaintive side demonstrated
by The Widow and Miranda, That
Ghost Just Isn’t Holy Anymore
which both seem inspired by the
passing of Jeremy Ward and sur-
passes Televators for its emotional
immediacy. The other sound is the
mentioned Latin-American influ-
enced rhythms and thirdly there
are the post-rock sounding “noo-
dling” bits and jamming which col-
our and break up the former sounds.
Cassandra Gemini is the culmina-
tion of all these facets and may feel
unordered but order is never fun or
ever really human. They refuse to
be anything except themselves and
for that they have produced a truly
inspirational album.

SINGLE REVIEW
“’Mon tha Biffy!” Biffy Clyro have
provided the best live sets I’ve ever
seen, closely challenged by Muse.
Unfortunately, the bane of every
indie elitist’s life, popularity, has
hit Simon Neil, and the brothers
Johnston like a big Kerrang! shaped
truck.
After their second album, The
Vertigo Of Bliss, things seemed to
go a bit crazy in camp Biffy. There
was the download-only single
There’s No Such Thing As A Jaggy
Snake which, despite sounding like
three blokes screaming over the top
of a snake charmer’s melody, beat
releases by Avril Lavigne and Keane
to the top of the download chart.
They then released their new album
Infinity Land, with singles Glitter
And Trauma (skittery alt-rock), My
Recovery Injection (accessible emo-
style rock) and now Only One Word
Comes To Mind. What does their
new single sound like? Well, I’ve
heard it compared to The Smiths.
Bright guitars jangle, drums bounce
along, and they show off their triple
pronged singer attack with some
nifty vocal harmonies. It’s got a tune
like no Biffy song since their debut
album Blackened Sky. and then,
randomly, at the end it explodes
into a heavy metal riff! Bonkers. It’s
bound to bring even more black clad
teenagers into their ever-increasing
fold. And after years of being one of
the most exciting underground rock
bands in Britain, they deserve all
the success they will get.
