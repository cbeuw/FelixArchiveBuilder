I’m sure everyone at Imperial
knows where the Sherfield
Building is. Apart from being
‘that place where we have
exams and go to the JCR’,
it also boasts the Blyth Art
Gallery on its fifth floor. This
is the annual setting for
Photosoc’s exhibition, dis-
playing the best work from
our members.
This year the committee
designated the (optional)
theme to be ‘Exploring Time’.
The theme was deliberate-
ly made to be quite vague,
in order to give members
freedom to interpret it. As a
result, our exhibition has a
real mix of photos, some quite
wacky shots as well as more
conventional prints.
Half of the photos are
framed, with the rest being
mounted directly on foam
board to give an experimental
feel to a section of our exhibi-
tion. The photos are roughly
split between digital and film
prints, both black and white
and colour. Digital prints are
certainly more of a feature in
this exhibition compared to
previous years. For the first
time, we are also exhibiting a
set of camera phone photos,
by Gus Sepp.
Asinpreviousyears,awards
were given for the best photos
at the opening evening (last
Thursday). Rather than the
committee judging, the task
was given to Richard Dickins,
director of music at Imperial,
and Mindy Lee, the College’s
arts animateur, both of whom
helped organise the exhibi-
tion along with the Photosoc
committee and members.
The overall winner was
Kristina Buch, with runners-
up in colour (Sarah Shemilt)
and black and white (Pavlos
Papaefstathiou).Alsonewthis
year was the audience vote,
won by Fenella Beynon. The
vote was conducted using a
state of the art ballot box, spe-
cially cobbled together from
spare bits in the dark room,
just in time for the opening
evening.
Also exhibiting alongside
Photosoc are some jewellery
sculptures which look impos-
sible to create. If you have got
any spare time, make sure
you visit the gallery before 20
March when the exhibition
ends to see our award win-
ning work!
If exhibiting in a real art gal-
lery sounds good to you, join
Photosoc and you’ll be able
to take part in next year’s
exhibition. Photosoc holds
meetings every Thursday at
1pm in dBs and events (some
subsidised) throughout the
term, ranging from photo
shooting trips to studio ses-
sions to darkroom tutorials.
It’s great to see that we have
so many photographers at
Imperial. With the prolifera-
tion of camera phones, this
number is sure to increase in
the future.
