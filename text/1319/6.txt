In October 2006, the first home and
EU undergraduate students paying
£3,000 a year ‘top-up’ fees will arrive
at Imperial College. Whilst they will
not pay the fees until after they grad-
uate, the College will receive the
money up front, through the Student
Loans Company. Consequently,
there will be a fair amount of extra
income coming into Imperial, esti-
mated at around £11m per year
(once all undergraduates are paying
the higher fees).
Where will the extra £11m be
spent? Well, just over £3m will
be spent on financing a bursary
scheme, approved by the Office of
Fair Access. This will be used to
provide bursaries of between £300
and £4000 to supplement the main-
tenance grants and loans received
by students from the poorest back-
grounds. That still leaves the other
£8m – which the College still needs
to work out how to spend.
A substantial proportion of it
should go directly into teaching.
But how exactly should a few extra
million pounds a year be used to
improve teaching quality? There are
a huge number of possibilities. It
could be spent on facilities such as
labs or libraries. Maybe there could
be more use of (expensive) practical
teaching rather than theory-based
teaching (lectures) where that is
appropriate.
Extra money could also be allo-
cated to staff pay. This could be
beneficial to students and teach-
ing quality in a number of ways.
For example, by offering higher
salaries, the College could attract
better lecturers. Staff/student
ratios could be improved, lead-
ing to smaller classes. Have you
been affected by a brilliant lecturer
being made redundant because they
do not bring in enough research
income? Having extra money to
employ teaching staff could allow for
such teaching experts to be hired or
retained.
Perhaps you think that teaching
itself is OK but that money needs
to be invested in supporting skills
development. Would you like the
College to spend more money on
things like ‘soft skills’ training and
help with job hunting?
These are all the sorts of questions
we need to be asking. Higher tuition
fees improve the status of students
as ‘customers’ of the College. If we
are going to be paying the College
a significant amount of extra money
then we should be in a strong posi-
tion to influence how that money is
spent.
How to spend money on improving
teaching quality is something that
the Union as well as the College as a
whole need discuss in a positive and
constructive manner. I welcome all
comments from students and look
forward to the debate.
How should teaching be topped up?

The house-hunting checklist
It’s getting to that time when stu-
dents are starting to think about
where they’re going to live next
year. Perhaps you have to move
out of halls, or perhaps you would
like to move somewhere for another
reason.
When trying to find a place to rent,
it can be a stressful time, not only
trying to find somewhere but also
keeping your potential housemates
happy, as many people have dif-
ferent standards in what they are
looking for.
It’s important to read any contract
you are given thoroughly before sign-
ing it, as in some cases it could con-
tain unfair terms. The Information
and Advice Centre Offers a tenancy
agreement checking service which
is free to use. We will be able to
advise you if the terms within the
contract are unfair or not.
Below is a checklist of things to
look out for when having a look
round a property. I hope that it will
be helpful for you. Also, as this is the
last issue before Easter, I’d just like
to say happy holidays!
External features
A visual inspection of the exterior of
the property is always useful. Look
for the following:
● Slipped or broken tiles
● Rotten timber (especially window
frames and doors)
● Broken guttering
● Crumbling or cracked walls
● Adequate storage for rubbish
● Whether the property has a yard
or garden – if so, ask who will be
responsible for its maintenance.
Internal features
There are a number of questions
that you need to ask either yourself
or the landlord/agent when visiting
a property. These include:
● How many rooms are there in the
property?
● How many are communal rooms?
● Are enough facilities being pro-
vided for the number of people who
will be sharing the house?
● Is the furniture in a good state?
● How is the property heated?
● Do the fridge, cooker etc work
properly?
● Is there plenty of hot water?
● Is the house free of damp and/or
mould?
Safety and security features
In addition to checking for yourself
that the contents that are provided
are sufficient and in working order,
it is vital that you ask questions to
the landlord/agent about the safety
and security of the property. If in
doubt, talk to the Information and
Advice Service. The following ques-
tions are essential:
● Does the landlord possess a cur-
rent gas safety certificate?
● Can the landlord prove that a
CORGI registered engineer carried
out the inspection?
● Have you checked to see that all
gas appliances within the property
have been included, and passed as
being safe, on the gas safety cer-
tificate?
● Did the inspection take place
within the last 12 months?
● Is there any fire detection equip-
ment (eg smoke alarms) and does
it work?
● If there was a fire, would you
be able to escape using the main
exits?
● Has the electrical wiring been
checked within the last five years?
● Are all plug sockets free from
cracks or other damage?
● Are there sufficient plug sockets
in each room?
● Does all furniture comply with the
relevant regulations?
● Are there locks on the windows?
● Have the previous tenants all
returned their keys?
Location of the property
As well as looking at the property
itself, we recommend that you also
consider where the property is situ-
ated and ask yourself the following
questions:
● Is the area convenient for your
studies?
● How close are you to public trans-
port?
● Are local shops and facilities ade-
quate?
● Would you feel safe walking in the
area at night?
If you have any housing enquiries at
all, or would like to discuss this arti-
cle further, contact the Information
and Advice Centre on advice@ic.

The joy of... Faculty Unions
Imperial College Union is renowned
the world over for having a slightly
bizarre and rather complex struc-
ture. The layer that bewilders most
people is our system of Faculty
Unions. Originally developing from
a collection of social clubs based in
each Constituent College (prior to
the recent restructuring of Imperial
into Faculties), the Faculty Unions
offer our students another layer of
possible involvement in College life.
What do they do, though? They
co-ordinate academic representa-
tion in their respective Faculties
(using a network of representatives
elected by each course, year-group,
research group, etc); organise cen-
tral activities (such as RAG Week
events, bar nights, freshers’ balls);
oversee the Buddies Schemes which
introduce freshers into the wonders
that Imperial College has to offer
and look after other aspects of stu-
dent welfare; and serve a variety of
clubs and departmental societies,
offering them a link to the Union,
as well as keeping track of their
finances.
“Wow!”Ihearyouexclaim.“Inever
knew they did so much! How do I get
involved?” Well, the City & Guilds
College Union (representing all stu-
dents in the Faculty of Engineering),
theFacultyofLifeSciencesStudents’
Union and the Faculty of Physical
Sciences Students’ Union (known as
LifeSci and PhysSci to their friends)
are currently in the middle of elec-
tion fever. Whilst nominations are
closed for most positions, it’s not
too late to take an active interest in
the elections, read the candidates’
manifestos, and vote for those who
you think will represent you the
best. In addition, Faculty Unions are
always crying out for more support
from volunteers. Imperial College
School of Medicine Students’ Union
(ICSMSU) is holding its elections
next term, so look out for more info
on this. For more information on
all elections, please see www.union.
ic.ac.uk/elections.
That ‘OLE Survey
On-Line Evaluations (or OLEs, as
they are more affectionately known)
seem to be all the rave at the
moment. Just as you thought you’d
got used to SOLE – the Student
On-Line Evaluation – ROLE comes
round the corner. ROLE, the
Researchers’ On-Line Evaluation,
ran College-wide for the first time
over the last two weeks. It man-
aged to attain an overall response
of 39%, reaching a superb 50% in
the two Science Faculties. Those of
you who took the time to fill it in can
give yourselves a pat on the back for
helping to provide your department
with the vital feedback it needs to
improve the quality of its provision
for research students. If you have
any comments about the survey,
please contact role@imperial.ac.uk.
SOLE is currently online, and will
be until the 18th March. It achieved
an excellent response rate of 50%
last term, and it would be great
if we could beat that, to show the
College that students do care, and
we do have a voice in the way we
are educated. Visit www.imperial.
ac.uk/sole.
Watch out for further OLEs on the
horizon, including a survey which
will be launched next year covering
the College pastoral care system.
The working title is – you’ve guessed
it – POLE.
Have a great holiday, and don’t
work too hard!
