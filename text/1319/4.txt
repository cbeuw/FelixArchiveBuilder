Apathy. It could be the great-
est threat to humans yet.
Changes in climate could lead
to outbreaks of malaria, water
shortages and flash floods.
Skin cancer might even cause
5000 more deaths a year. So
why are we more passionate
about foxhunting?
That was a question raised
during the Royal Society of
Arts (RSA) debate on climate
change earlier last month.
The debate questioned
whether climate change real-
ly is one of the most pressing
threats ever to mankind.
Guest speakers included
Michael Grubb, Professor
of Climate Change and
Energy Policy at Imperial
College, Stephen Tindale of
Greenpeace UK, BP’s envi-
ronmental advisor Chris
Mottershead and Vijay
Vaitheeswaran of the The
Economist. And, like the
British Government has
begun to agree, they believe
that we’re in a lot of trouble.
Beginning the debate,
Stephen Tindale commented
that “not a single paper chal-
lenges that climate change
is happening”. Assuming a
linear increase in global
warming is in store for us,
he believes that one in three
people will suffer in the next
century unless we act now.
But neither the root of cli-
mate change nor the changes
we face are completely clear.
Studies reveal that glo-
bal warming is happening,
but not how, said Professor
Grubb. “The science behind
theIntergovernmentalPanel
on Climate Change [IPCC]
stops at the end of this cen-
tury, so it’s difficult to know
how things will proceed” he
said. That places a big ques-
tion mark over how to tackle
both the change in climate
and the consequences.
However, Vijay Vaithees-
waran believes that “because
carbon dioxide stays in the air
for about a century, we should
now be concentrating on pre-
paring future generations” as
well as reducing emissions.
He also believes that Europe
alone can’t solve the prob-
lem of climate change and
that people need to act on an
international level. The Kyoto
agreement that came into
action on 16 February hopes
to do just that.
Yet there are sceptics of cli-
mate change who argue that
humans are not to blame for
global warming. They shine
the torch of responsibility at
solar cycles and the changing
frequency of volcanic erup-
tions. However, findings last
week, that the past 40 years of
ocean warming can be linked
to the industrial release of
carbon dioxide, might change
their minds.
Among the impending dis-
asters, we are also told of the
number of appealing possibil-
ities. Tales of grapes growing
in Southern England, hotter
summers and warmer win-
ters are just a few examples.
The climate section of the
BBC website even says that
by 2060 the south of England
could experience weather
like that of the Loire Valley,
in France. All this amounts
to a confusing message for
the public, and some may be
seduced by the idea. It might
even explain some of the
UK’s indifference to climate
change.
Much like climate change
itself, apathy towards it is
global too. Despite 51% of
Americans expressing con-
cern about global warming,
an annual poll in the US found
that a large number of people
considered it ‘a bit of a yawn’.
But the poll’s results are
no surprise really. It is well
known that the US churns
out a huge percentage of the
world’s industrial greenhouse
gases and still doesn’t consid-
er carbon dioxide a pollutant.
Professor Grubb made it
clear at the RSA conference
that the US even has the high-
est total carbon emissions,
as well as the highest per
capita. “Countries like the US
who are powerful and have
the greatest emissions are a
great threat,” he believes.
Canada, Australia and New
Zealand as well as the UK
are such countries and hang
close to the heels of the US.
Interestingly, Grubb’s results
showed India and China, with
their massive populations, far
lower down the carbon emis-
sions scale.
Ironically, the US refuses
to ratify the Kyoto agreement
because of a “lack of restric-
tions on emissions by emerg-
ing economies China and
India” said The Japan Times
(17 February 2005). Yet these
are the countries to which the
West voices their authority.
They often argue that such
populations do little to com-
bat climate change.
During the RSA conference,
Vijay Vaitheeswaran stated
that “developing countries
resent being told to reduce
emissions by rich countries
who have become prosperous
through polluting. They often
ask: ‘why should we slow our
economy for you?’”
A valid point. So how do
we reach a compromise?
According to the majority of
the panel, the answer lies
within well-coordinated com-
munication between politi-
cians of all countries. It also
requires establishing a trend
through setting an example.
“If Europe doesn’t break with
its efforts, it’s a more hopeful
situation with the US,” said
Professor Grubb. This option
also relies on businesses tak-
ing more action.
However,ChrisMottershead
of BP trusts in the steps
industries are already taking.
“Governments and industries
are tackling climate change,”
he said, “but we should be
concentrating on implement-
ing technology within compa-
nies to reduce carbon emis-
sions.”
The Carbon Trust is less
convinced and is running a
campaign to enthuse busi-
nesses to get a move on.
In DEFRA magazine, Tom
Delay, Chief Executive of the
trust, says: “Some UK busi-
nesses have chosen to act
already – but more need to do
so. Businesses need to under-
stand that there is a real com-
mercial benefit to be gained”.
He also believes that “as
public concern about climate
change grows, businesses
will naturally become more
interested in and committed
to cutting their carbon emis-
sions”.
So what will it take to
generate public concern?
Fictionalising natural disas-
ters such as The Day After
Tomorrow and Twister
appear only to boost box
office earnings, and experts
pour scorn on the science
behind them.
The British Government
appears to be taking the
issue more seriously now.
With energy suppliers and
the Energy Saving Trust, it
has just launched a £3m cam-
paign to address feelings of
apathy in households tackling
climate change.
Our concern should be
growing. But if we need evi-
dence on our doorstep, then
the predictions state we need
only wait a decade or two.

Global warming: does anyone care?
The evidence is there, the scientists are in agreement, but still the public remains sceptical.

What can I do? Here’s what...
1. Windows: Keep them closed while the heating or
air conditioning is on.
2. Power: Unless it’s necessary to keep them on, turn
off lights, computers, TVs and other electrical goods
when you’re not using them.
3. Heating: Turning your thermostat down by 1°C
could cut your heating bills by up to 10%.
4. Plug it: Always put the plug in your basin or sink.
Leaving hot water running straight down the drain really
is throwing money away.
5. Curtains: close your curtains at dusk to stop heat
escaping through the windows.
6. Lights: Always turn them off when you leave a
room and adjust your curtains or blinds to let in as
much light as possible during the day.
7. Fridges: Don’t leave the door open for longer than
necessary. Defrost your freezer regularly to (run more
efficientlycheaply). If your fridge is next to a cooker/
boiler, leave a good gap in-between.
8. Washing machines/tumble dryers: Always
wash a full load. If you can’t, use a half-load or
economy programme. Use a low temperature
programme (washing powders are effective at lower
temperatures). Hang clothes up to dry if possible.
9. Dishwashers: Use the low temperature
programme and ensure you wash a full load.
“Because carbon
dioxide stays in
the air for about a
century, we should
now concentrate
on preparing
future generations”
Climate change apathy: what will it take for us to realise the dangers?
“Developing coun-
tries resent being
told to reduce
emissions by rich
countries who have
prospered through
polluting”
