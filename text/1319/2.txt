By an Imperial student
At the beginning of the two-
day extradition hearing,
Babar Ahmad walked into
court accompanied by three
policemen, turning to smile
at his family and support-
ers from Imperial College.
He confirmed his name and
had to correct the clerk on
his date of birth. He looked
unflustered as the charges
were read out – no doubt he
had heard them numerous
times before.
The allegations were based
on computer evidence, quoted
and repeated several times by
John Hardy, appearing for the
US government. As this was
an extradition hearing, the
defence was unable to chal-
lenge any of the evidence in
court, and so its reliability was
not discussed. The evidence
quoted included email com-
munications with a person on
a US naval ship – the dates of
which, according to the Free
Babar Ahmad campaign, coin-
cided with Mr Ahmad’s wed-
ding day and his honeymoon
on a remote island without
internet access. Also quoted
as evidence was a publicly
available documentary DVD
on 9/11.
Edward Fitzgerald QC, for
the defence, stated the risks
facing Babar if extradited to
the US, the first being indefi-
nite detention as an ‘enemy
combatant’, which would
involve “a flagrant denial of
the principles of justice”.
Thomas Loflin, a Supreme
Court attorney and expert in
US criminal law, appeared
as an expert witness for the
defence having submitted
two affidavits to court. He
stated that there was a real
risk that Mr Ahmad would be
turned over to the military
as an ‘enemy combatant’. If
so, he needn’t even be given
a trial.
Under Military Order
Number 1, the only trial avail-
able to him would be by mili-
tary commission, to which
even evidence obtained via
torture would be admissible.
The Order expressly forbids
appeal to any other court. A
military commission could
apply the death penalty. He
could be handed over to the
military as an ‘enemy combat-
ant’ even if tried and acquit-
ted in a civilian court.
Mr Ahmad could be
detained in Guantanamo Bay,
“or worse”, according to Mr
Loflin, who also referred to
prisons in other countries
such as in Afghanistan, Egypt
and Pakistan. The ‘Doctrine
of Specialty’, which prevents
an extradited person being
tried for offences other than
those he was extradited for,
would not apply in such plac-
es since they are outside US
territory. Mr Loflin also com-
mented that “US courts have
a somewhat elastic view of
the Doctrine of Specialty”.
Even if not declared an
‘enemy combatant’, Mr
Ahmad could be subject to
‘Special Administrative Meas-
ures’, regardless of whether
he is convicted or awaiting
trial. Under these meas-
ures he could be indefinitely
detained in solitary confine-
ment and have restrictions
placed on his contact with
lawyers.
Mr Loflin then mentioned
the possibility that if Mr
Ahmad was tried in a civilian
court, the death penalty could
still be applied if prosecutors
seek a superceding indict-
ment, for example combin-
ing a conspiracy to murder
charge with a murder charge
(which can carry the death
penalty). He also expressed
grave doubts that Mr Ahmad
could get a fair trial by jury
in America, citing attacks
and discrimination against
Muslims after 9/11.
Mr Loflin further affirmed
that a written assurance that
the death penalty would not
be applied had to come from
the top if it was to be effective
– that is, from the President
or the Attorney General.
The opposing lawyers could
not agree on whether declar-
ing Mr Ahmad an ‘enemy
combatant’ would be a breach
of the Extradition Treaty.
In the end Mr Hardy agreed
on what the potential conse-
quences were if Mr Ahmad
were handed over to the mili-
tary, but would not agree on
whether there was a real risk
of this happening.
At noon on the trial’s sec-
ond day, Mr Hardy asked the
judge for a further two to three
weeks to gather more evi-
dence to support his case by
interaction with the US gov-
ernment. This was granted,
and the trial was adjourned.
It was agreed that a review
and remand hearing be held
on 24 March 2005, via a video-
link with Mr Ahmad. The trial
will continue on 18 April 2005
at Bow Street Magistrates
Court.
