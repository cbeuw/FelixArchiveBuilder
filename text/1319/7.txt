Silwood science: fashion victims
Andy Brown, Silwood Park correspondent, looks at how fur is being used as a fashion accessory
Apparently one of the ‘must have’
items this season are fur boots.
Made from the fur of rabbits, they
are rarely found for less than £200
in London.
As we will, one day, be graduates
of one of the best universities in
the country, we are expected to go
into the wider world with knowledge
and opinions, so I have compiled
the thoughts of Silwood residents
on this, a subject especially close to
our hearts.
Bunny boots have been photo-
graphed on many a celebrity this
winter and shops have complained
that they have not been supplied
with enough to cope with demand.
Apart from the major practicality
drawback of them being cream or
light grey, and so easily made dirty,
I would like to raise some other
issues with them being seen as a
‘must have’ item.
I am not a vegetarian, I do how-
ever eat free-range eggs, I have no
argument against the regulated use
of animals in scientific research for
the advance of science, for example
aiding the understanding of debili-
tating diseases of animals including
humans. However I do have issues
with rabbits or other animals being
bred and killed for the sole purpose
of their skins being used to make
someone look ‘cool’. It is not even
as if the skins are a utilised by-
product of meat used by the hungry
locals in these countries, who are
without a doubt earning less than
our minimum wage to make these
boots and clothes. There was also
an example of fox fur being used
as a fashion accessory in the Julien
Macdonald show to launch London
fashion week. I am sure it was not
long ago that supermodels and ani-
mal rights campaigners were united
against the use of fur.
As is the case in science, when
an opinion is formed it is often
not a one-sided argument. Should
animal fur be used in fashion? I
own leather shoes; however these
cows were not bred solely for their
hide, their meat was used too. There
are also the cases where I feel ani-
mal fur being used is a good thing.
Take the example of the Australian
bushtail possum (Trichosurus
vulpecula), introduced into New
Zealand from Australia back in
1858, which has since had a dev-
astating impact on New Zealand’s
native ground nesting birds, nearly
driving these species to extinction
(a well-known example is the kiwi).
A national possum eradication pro-
gramme is underway, costing the
country $50m annually. One way
that has been developed to help
raise funds to cover this is the
sale of possum fur products. Once
killed, possums are put through a
‘possum plucker’, removing their
fur, which is then made into
jumpers, socks, gloves and nipple
warmers (yes that’s right, nipple
warmers) to sell to locals and tour-
ists alike.
Silwood residents put forward
their opinions on this, and although
scientists are not renowned for
being the most fashion conscious
bunch, the results were interest-
ing. With an even split of males and
females taking part in a question-
naire, more than two thirds of peo-
ple disagreed with fur being used
as a fashion accessory. The vast
majority did, however, agree that
in cases such as the Australian
bushtail possum, fur clothing is a
good way to raise funds for much
needed and financially restricted
conservation.
The possum fur nipple warmers
did not go down so well, with only
one person admitting they would
wear them.
Speaking out for Babar Ahmad...
and for all of us
“All it takes for evil to triumph is for
good people to do nothing”
Edmund Burke
On Wednesday and Thursday of
last week, Babar Ahmad faced the
next stage of his extradition hear-
ing. Ultimately, the hearing was
adjourned until April, giving time
for the prosecution to wind their
way out of the latest brick wall they
have hit in their desperate efforts to
extradite Babar. You can read about
the case and what happened inside
the court in more detail on pages 1
and 2 of this newspaper. I want to
discuss what happened outside the
court on Wednesday morning.
It was a cold morning. No – it
was an unbelievably cold morning,
which deteriorated further as the
snow and sleet kicked in. But this
didn’t deter over 200 people from
gathering for hours outside Bow
Street Magistrates Court in Covent
Garden to protest against what was
happening inside.
This number included around
40 people from Imperial College.
The official Union delegation was a
mixed group of undergraduates and
postgraduates, Muslims and non-
Muslims, black and white, women
and men. In fact, the turnout, partic-
ularly given the weather conditions,
was extremely impressive, with the
only notable absentee being our
beloved president, Mustafa Arif.
It is true to say that the pro-
test really got going after we all
arrived, and despite not being able
to use our megaphone, a consider-
able amount of noise was made.
Protesters’ chants ranged from
“Free, Free, Babar Ahmad” to
“What do we want? Justice! When
do we want it? Now!” But it was also
clear that most people in attendance
linked what was happening to Babar
to issues of civil liberties and the
‘war on terror’ in the wider world,
with “Tony Blair, you will see, Iraq
and Babar will be free” and “Hey!
Ho! We say no to Guantanamo”
also ringing in the ears of those in
the court room. I learnt later that
Babar and his family heard our
chanting and were pleased at the
level of support.
After a short ‘break’ for tea, lunch
and anything else that people could
think of to warm themselves back
up, an even larger crowd gathered
around the court again to listen to
several speeches, many of which
pointed out the links between the
restriction of civil liberties and
recent events in the Middle East,
with the 19 March anti-war demo
being frequently plugged.
Speakers ranged from Lindsey
German (convenor of the Stop
the War Coaltion) to Yasmin
Ataullah, a representative from the
Muslim Association of Britain and
Respect. There were also repre-
sentatives from the Muslim com-
munity and the Socialist Workers
Party, but perhaps the most moving
speech was saved to last. Follwing
Babar’s father and his solicitor
was Martin Mubanga, one of the
four Britons recently released from
Guantanamo Bay. Listening to this
man, who has been held captive in
some of the worst prison conditions
in the world for the last three years,
seemed to move the whole crowd
and put into perspective the reality
of what Babar may face if he loses
his case.
The large turnout was impressive,
and showed many people’s realisa-
tion that we have to keep the fight
on the streets as well as in the cour
room itself. It also showed good
people’s willingness to stand up in
the face of evil, and to stand firmly
against it. Whilst the turnout was
high, we hope that even more of
you will join us next time, when
Babar’s hearing returns to court on
18 April.

Letters to the Editor
Pembridge prank
proves costly
Dear Editor,
Has anyone got a clue what is
going on with Pembridge students
being fined? Apparently a toilet was
wallpapered with newspaper and
rumour has it with some skill. A
student prank, and not a bad one at
that either. However the whole hall
has been given a fine of £20 each to
‘cover the cost’ of the damage, that’s
about two and a half grand. I had a
look at the toilet and someone has
taken the paper down leaving no
damage to walls or the paintwork at
all and if you have a look round the
place that toilet is somewhat unique
in that respect. What’s with the huge
cost? Surely they cannot fine over
100 innocent people when no actual
damage has been done, but we are
told if we do not pay it will be taken
straight out of our deposits.

Smoking ban
Dear Editor,
I would like to applaud the Union’s
decision to make DaVinci’s bar
smoke-free. Smoking is antisocial,
selfish and inconsiderate, so I am
disgusted by the unscrupulous tac-
tics employed to incite smokers into
retaliation.
This evening inflammatory notic-
es were placed on every table,
clearly designed to taunt smokers.
The signs carried a cartoon of a
man smashing through a brick wall,
with an AK-47 in one hand and an
UZI in the other, guns blazing. The
words NO SMOKING were painted
on the wall in dripping graffiti. When
I asked a girl behind the bar about
the signs, I was told that “some-
times the end justifies the means”,
so I suspect they were created by
disgruntled staff who resent the no-
smoking rules.
I encourage everyone who, like
me, detests being forced to inhale
others’ fumes to visit DaVinci’s this
month and submit their feedback to
the Union.
Kind regards,
Willard Wheezer
