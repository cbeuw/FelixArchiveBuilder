Entertain: the charity ball
By Alex Rathmell
Last Saturday, the Sherfield Building
was transformed for a night of live
music, dancing and drinking to raise
money for communities affected by
the tsunami. The Great Hall was
unrecognisable, decked out with
a huge stage, speaker stacks that
looked like Stonehenge, and a bar
of similar proportions. Another bar
had appeared in the Ante Room,
catering for thirsty punters enjoying
more live entertainment in the Main
Dining Hall.
The famous Big Band kicked off
the proceedings, beginning their
fourth gig in four days. It didn’t
show. In fact, this reviewer had seen
all three of their preceding shows,
and, if anything, they were getting
better. After a blistering first set,
they began running up a healthy bar
tab, handing the torch over to rock
band Cartel to get underway in the
Great Hall.
All the way from Stoke-on-Trent
(someone’s got to be), Cartel’s
unique brand of melody-driven
punk-rock, interspersed with
comedy banter and shameless plug-
ging of CDs, went down a storm.
The crowd bounced their way
through a 45-minute set encompass-
ing plenty of the band’s own cata-
logue and even an unlikely Franz
Ferdinand cover. You can catch
Cartel at this Friday’s Rock City
event at the Union – I’ll be down the
front, spilling my beer.
Meanwhile in the MDH, the Big
Band were launching into their sec-
ond set. Packed with classics, their
show ended with the whole room on
its feet, dancing in the aisles. Huge
thanks go to the whole band for
delivering the goods once again. You
can see them for the last time before
Easter on Thursday 17 March in
dB’s, and I suggest you do, if only for
their unfailingly entertaining range
of hats.
Everyone then seemed to pile
en masse into the Great Hall for
some up-beat tunes from DJ Mark
Rivkin, followed by the final band of
the evening, the gloriously monik-
ered Our Souls. Their set was a
high-velocity trip round almost
every genre of popular music imagi-
nable, all delivered in a foot-shuf-
flingly funky style. The crowd was
shaking its thing and the drinks
were flowing.
The night culminated in a
trademark set from Fabric resi-
dent DJ MacPherson, before the
audience dispersed and the lights
went down.
In all, the evening raised several
thousand pounds, which is to be
split between Oxfam and Action Aid
for redevelopment in the areas hit
by the tsunami. The money will be
used, amongst other things, to pro-
vide local people with tools, mate-
rials, shelter and wages as they
rebuild their communities and get
themselves back on their feet. It
was all made possible through the
support of production companies
Orbital Sound and Sound2Light,
the generosity of the bands and
DJs, the bars and the caterers, and
through the unfailing enthusiasm,
commitment and expertise of the
event’s organisers, Richard Jordan,
Mark Rivkin and Kylie Daniels.
Organising an event on this scale is
challenging enough, but to do it for
zero cost, so that every penny of
ticket sales goes to charity, is a fan-
tastic achievement.
But no money would have been
raised without those of you who
paid your tenner and came along
on the night. You’ve really made a
difference, and shared Imperial’s
best night of entertainment this
year. So thank you. But you don’t
have to stop there. Real change to
help the world’s poor will come only
from sustained effort. So do your bit
today, and let’s not wait for the next
tsunami.
