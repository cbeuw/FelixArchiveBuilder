Growing up in a morally uptight fam-
ily, Alfred Kinsey (Liam Neeson) has
always been taught to consider sex
as a major taboo. Hence, Alfred has
never known intimacy with a woman
until he marries Clara McMillen
(Laura Linney). Alfred is a biolo-
gist, and being the scientist that he
is, he believes that there is a scien-
tific solution to every problem. Thus,
after a disastrous first night in bed,
he decides to meet up with a sex doc-
tor to resolve their issues; a meeting
that spurns Alfred and Clara into a
journey of sexual experimentation
and discovery.
Much to Alfred’s surprise, he dis-
covers that other couples are simi-
larly ignorant about sex (it is the
year 1948). Realising this astonish-
ing dearth of clinical research and
scientific data about sex, he sets
himself on a journey to understand
it by stripping away the emotional
entanglements. His research expos-
es not just the common hetero-
sexual relationship, but also other
controversial relationships such as
bestiality and homosexuality. It also
favours polygamous relationships as
these apparently have the ability to
spice up one’s sex life.
Alfred does not just view his find-
ingsasaseparateaspectofhislife;he
applies them to his marriage as well.
Through his research, he becomes
involved in a homosexual relation-
ship with his research colleague,
Clyde Martin (Peter Sarsgaard). He
even allows his wife, Clara, to engage
in extra-marital sex. When his find-
ings are first published, they are
likened to the explosion of an atom
bomb by the press and Alfred is held
in high regard by every American for
his expertise in sex.
However, his fall from the throne
arrives when he decides to publish
his findings on the sexual behaviour
of American women. His research
is met with disgust, and he loses all
funding for his research. His wave
of bad luck does not end there. The
sexual utopia Alfred has created
between his research mates and
their wives crumbles to pieces when
Clyde’s wife threatens to leave him
for another man. As a result, Alfred
spirals into a pool of self-doubt and
depression.
Frankly, Kinsey does not provoke
today’s audience as much as he
must have done in the fifties. The
internet has, without doubt, helped
alert today’s public to every imagi-
nable and warped method there is to
achievesexualsatisfaction.However,
the real shock behind Kinsey is the
fact that homosexuality, bestiality
and polygamy were practised in the
fifties. Many have argued that these
methods are prevalent in the 21st
century due to moral degradation
in our society. However, the satan-
ic tools accused of spreading this
moral degradation had not yet come
into existence in the fifties. Does it
mean that these things, considered
unnatural by many, are in fact, natu-
ral after all?
The cast list is one to be applaud-
ed. Liam Neeson plays the role of an
emotionally inadequate scientist to
perfection. His control of his body
language and facial expressions is
a perfect manifestation of his acting
skills. Peter Sarsgaard also gives a
convincing performance as a bisex-
ual young man. However, Laura
Linney needs to vary her facial
expressions to further strengthen
her role as the supporting, uncon-
ventional wife of an eccentric.
One cannot watch Kinsey and not
expect any scenes of nudity. Kinsey
is in fact littered with nudity and
provocative sex scenes. However,
these are done in an objective and
tasteful manner which helps remind
the audience that it is purely a biopic
depicting the scientific findings of
the American sexual culture in the
post-war years.
Overall, Kinsey is a not a movie to
be taken lightly. It provokes one to
question one’s sexuality and one’s
idea of ‘normal’ sexuality. It might
even prove offensive to some, but
for open-minded viewers who can
take it in their stride it is well worth
a watch. Nevertheless, watching
the eccentricities Mrs Kinsey has
to endure puts all other relationship
issues in their place. So, Mrs Kinsey,
I salute you! Angela Yuen Lee

A movie about sex. A ruler. You write the caption
“Homosexuality,
bestiality and
polygamy were all
practised in the
fifties”
Flying high
Discontented pilot Frank Towns
(Dennis Quaid) and his co-pilot AJ
(Tyrese Gibson) arrive on a plane
in the Mongolian desert to pick up
a group of oil-digging people and
take them back home. So, after a
few arguments and angry looks,
the group eventually packs up and
departs.
The audience gets to know each
character after a bit of friendly chat
between the seated groups. As you
could very well guess, the plane ride
isn’t what you would call a smooth or
pleasant journey. A huge sandstorm
causes turbulence. Towns makes
the dumb decision to fly through,
over and then around the storm.
Ultimately the plane starts falling to
pieces and crash lands.
Obviously the radio antenna is one
of the pieces that falls off, causing no
distress signals to be sent out before
crashing. Though Towns endan-
gers all their lives, no-one puts the
blame on him as he flies through
the storm. Instead they thank him
for crashing.
After realising they are in the mid-
dle of a huge desert and miles away
from their original path, they real-
ise no-one is going to find them.
One important comment that did
come up every single time was that
nobody really cares about these peo-
ple and nobody would actually be
searching for them. Rub it in, why
don’t they?
So they have very little water and
even less food and the hope of being
rescued is quickly dwindling. After
a huge display of animal behaviour
over water, Elliott (Giovanni Ribisi)
brings on the unexpected news of
re-building the plane. Of course, they
have all the tools necessary and the
design, according to Elliott, is per-
fect. This plan, however, needed a
lot of cooperation from every single
person. After firstly disbanding the
idea, they give it a shot as it would
be something to do as opposed to
just standing around.
The newly built plane is to be
named Phoenix after a mythical bird
that is reborn from its own ashes,
hence the name of the movie.
I must admit that this was one
of the better films that I’ve seen
for some time. The audience is
kept thrilled with the inclusion of
a marauding gang of black-clothed
ninja-looking bad people who use
humans as target practice.
This plot is not about history or
heart-warming characteristics of
the human soul. It isn’t a love story
and you won’t be impressed by the
solution to their problems either.
This is just a good old movie that
will get your heart pounding the
old-fashioned way (remember what
that’s like?) It’s just plain exciting.
It’s an extraordinary bit of film
making. The questions are: can
they all work together? Can Elliott’s
design work? Will they get out before
the ninjas attack them?
However, the main and most inter-
esting question is: who is going to
die next? The pacing of the movie is
brisk and energetic and it has loads
of spirit.
As for acting skills, Ribisi’s high
nasal voice is just hilarious and
deadly serious. Does this movie
bring out the action-adventure-ness
in it? Definitely!
The CGI is also pretty good and
believable, though the sandstorm
did seem pretty as opposed to scary
with its mysterious shifting sand.
Sure, the movie is pretty predictable,
due to its lovely title, but it’s great
fun. It also had a great soundtrack
that couldn’t have been any better.
All that can be said is, this flight is
definitely one to be boarded!
