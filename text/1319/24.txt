THEATRE
Taking a break from the West End
theatre scene can be refreshing, but
it can also be risky. If you like to take
risks and see new plays, and support
the arts in a way that might actually
benefit the growth of fringe theatres,
I encourage you to take a step out
and do some research on the thea-
tres that house this kind of work.
But don’t go to The Most
Humane Way to Kill a Lobster, at
least not until the end of the run.
Perhaps, by then, it might have
a bit more meat on its bones and
be able to pull off what put me off.
First time playwright Duncan
Macmillan and first time direc-
tor Claire Lizzimore are just that
– first-timers. There were several
motifs and effects that they both
wanted to incorporate, but it came
across as a desperate attempt at
an ideal that just can’t be fulfilled
in small theatre, with a small cast,
and with an under-worked script.
Inexperience isn’t terrible, how-
ever – this production was a great
way to watch progress. It would be
interesting to see the show twice;
once at the beginning and once at
the end of the run in order to see
how the show has improved.
The Most Humane Way to Kill a
Lobster is about anything but. There
may have been a motif or symbol
of some sort involved there, but I
missed it. Loretta, played by Holly
de Jong, is an estranged mother dis-
connected from the rest of the world.
Throughout the play she is gaining
courage to confront a dark spot in
her past while maintaining a home
and raising a daughter.
Loretta is the only character who
speaks for the whole of the play. At
the supposed climactic point of the
play, one other character speaks,
but it doesn’t really set his character
apart from Loretta’s in any sense.
I’m sure the directors want to
send the message: it’s not what we
say but what we don’t say, but this
tired cliché is just that – tired, over-
used and overemphasised. The only
way most directors and playwrights
know how to convey this message
is by talking too much and giving
emphasis on silence at the climax,
which tends to be more annoying
than anything else.
Character development in this
production was rather poor. I could
tell that the actors could give more
than they were giving; they all had
the potential to do far better. None
of them were truly in the moment,
I saw each of them thinking about
their next move before they made it
and calculating what their response
would be to their scene partner. Most
audiences can see that, and many
actors think they can ride on past
without anyone noticing, but audi-
ences are smarter than you think
and they are a massive beast that
can tear a production to shreds if the
actor isn’t in the moment.
So the lesson here is that progress
is great but new writers and direc-
tors shouldn’t bite off more than
they can chew if they want to be
successful. Baby steps are the saf-
est route.
Perhaps you’ve heard of this one,
perhaps you’ve heard too much
about this show. Maybe you’re sick
of the publicity it’s getting. I was too.
That’s why I saw it. Hype is hype,
ladies and gents, and you never
know how things really go down
unless you see them with your own
eyes.
So I feasted my sights upon Patrick
Stewart and Joshua Jackson in their
performances of David Mamet’s A
Life in the Theatre.
ForthosenotfamiliarwithMamet’s
plays, they are all full of short lines
meant to be carried as realistic con-
versations with the characters inter-
rupting each other, interrupting
themselves and responding quickly
to the many things going on around
them. There are no dramatic pauses
or thoughtful self-righteous scenes
for the actors to embellish.
Mamet is also very anticlimac-
tic. He despises the ‘shock and awe
factor’ in the cliché sense. Mamet
strives to shock audiences by show-
ing them a very raw vision of life.
He uses dry humour to make his
audiences laugh, and as soon as
the audience is used to laughing he
subtly grabs them by the balls and
makes them cry.
This particular Mamet play is
about two characters, one young
and one old, one with experience and
one without, and you follow them on
a journey through, pardon my pun, a
life in the theatre.
Joshua Jackson, while dreamy and
all that good stuff, played more than
an inexperienced actor – he was
one. Next to a marvel like Patrick
Stewart, it took me a while to dis-
cover Jackson’s character. He was
out for the laughs and when he got
them, he became more relaxed and
eased into it. But actors should not
depend on their audiences for suc-
cess. They must be able to hold their
own, and I noticed him struggling
with that.
Patrick Stewart, on the other hand,
was astounding. His performance
would make Mamet cry. He obvi-
ously understood Mamet’s inten-
tions with the character and the play
and carried them out with apparent
ease. Hurrah for actors who study
their playwrights!
The set and lighting were very
clever and should be studied by
those considering a career in both
fields. On the surface it was very
simple, but this sort of simplicity is
rather hard to come by in a success-
ful fashion. The actors, when ‘per-
forming’, played to an audience that
was behind them. Our backstage
was their audience, and their back-
stage was where the audience was.
But the way the drop was painted
and the way the lights were used,
you could almost see the mirror
image of yourself watching the play
they were putting on for another
fictional audience.
Out of all the West End shows
I’ve read about and seen, I think
this one is the most worth the the-
atregoers’ money. It has a splash of
America with British theatre experi-
ence that balances and carries itself
very well.

EXHIBITION
A lot has been said about Matisse.
He’s been referred to as both
‘unchallenging’ and ‘a genius’,
and vast numbers of exhibitions
have been devoted to his work. He
enjoyed success in his lifetime and
continues to be popular. Matisse is
known by most and should, in fact,
be a part of anyone’s knowledge of
art and artists. So, with this recom-
mendation, I do urge you to book
tickets and go to the new show at
the Royal Academy.
I particularly love Matisse for
his use of colour: the colours are
bold, bright and exquisite. However,
the focus of this exhibition is not
so much colour but Matisse’s fas-
cination with and use of textiles
throughout his lifetime. The exhi-
bition charts the involvement of
Matisse with textiles form birth to
the end of his career.
It’s often easy to overlook the
influence of textiles on the compo-
sition of Matisse’s work; however,
this exhibition snaps them all into
focus very effectively and with a
lasting effect. Samples of textiles
from the artist’s hometown as well
as pieces representative of his per-
sonal collection are shown along-
side the paintings that used them as
inspiration.
One of the many treats in this
exhibition (while it is small, it does
pack in a lot) are the paintings
on loan from the Hermitage in St
Petersburg. Many of the paintings
will be familiar to cognoscenti, at
least in style and content even if
they’ve never seen them, but the
paintings on loan from Russia will
be new to most and represent a
period of Matisse’s artistic develop-
ment that many will be unfamiliar
with.
Other pieces meriting one’s spe-
cial attention are the collage and
paint works. These are what could
be called the culmination of his
obsession with textiles, forms and
colour. In his later life, Matisse
devoted increasingly more time
to these, producing some truly
stunning works of impressive
simplicity. What is missing from
the exhibition, however, are his
chasubles, but these are included in
the catalogue.
I do suggest booking tickets in
advance for this show, or at least
attempting to turn up at not particu-
larly normal gallery-going time, as
it is likely to be a very busy one. I
went to a preview on a Wednesday
evening and the place was packed!

Yes, I know we’ve already run this picture, but you’d be surprised at
how hard it is to find a good photo of Joshua Jackson
Putting your lobster into boiling
water straight from the fridge is
thought to be the most humane
way to end its life
