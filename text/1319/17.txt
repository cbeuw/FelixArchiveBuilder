ICU CHOIR
SPRING CONCERT:
BRAHMS: A GERMAN
REQUIEM
8pm
Great Hall, Sherfield Building
On the door: £4/£8
After the death of his moth-
er in 1865, Brahms’ grief
spurred him to compose this
Requiem. However, instead
of using the traditional Latin
text, with its terror of the
Day of Judgement, he care-
fully selected words from the
German Bible that would con-
sole the living. Ein Deutches
Requiem has since become
a Requiem for the early 21st
century.
