“Recognize the Bolsheviks?
Why, you may as well speak
of legalising sodomy!”
Thus spoke Spirit: Stallion of
the Cimarron, well not really,
Winston Churchill did. But
Spirit was a horse. Winston
Churchill wasn’t a horse but
I bet he liked them... almost
too much... but that’s not the
point.
So another competition
year is over for the Imperial
College Riding Club B/Shield
Team. The word ‘year’ is used
in the loosest sense as we
only competed in four com-
petitions against the same
three teams; Reading, RVC
and Surrey.
The second competition was
the RVC home competition,
held in the delightful township
of Slough. Cold, early morn-
ings aren’t conducive to me
being in the best of moods so
what could have made the day
better? It sure wasn’t waiting
outside in the cold at 8am
for our driver. What it was,
though, was the lack of mini-
bus. That’s right. No show-
ing up in classy IC minibus
style for us. Instead, we had
to sprint across Hyde Park
to Paddington, considerably
weighed down by our exten-
sive riding kit: hats, boots,
whips (ooh-err) and back
protectors (similar to Kevlar
stab-proof vests).
So what, I hear you ask,
actually happened at the com-
petition? Well, as is normal,
dressage was first up for the
day. I took a gingery (chest-
nut) animal who was appar-
ently still a baby, Kat rode
Mouse, Sarah was on a small
pony called Becky and El
chose Rocket who was reap-
pearing from last year.
Nothing terrible happened
and I was able to perfect
my dressage reading abil-
ity. Lunch was mediocre, a
few sandwiches and ‘Nice’
biscuits: disappointing really
after Reading’s banquet from
the previous week, but free
lunch is free lunch. When
you’re standing outside in the
cold for six hours, you learn to
value your lunch.
Anyway, jumping closed the
day. All four teams gathered
outside the arena to watch
the horses warm up. Kat was
delegated to ride Aria again
this year, a chunky grey mare.
Sarah took Acti who I had done
well on last year, and El rode
Dutch who had tossed her off
last year (pun intended?)
Once again, ‘dumb-as-nails’
Kate (me) took on the pow-
erhouse giraffe-on-speed that
was Figaro. But we all sur-
vived, which was nice. There
were no frightful incidences
to report, except that one of
the Reading girls didn’t pay
much attention and went
through the jump rather than
over it. Their grave mistake
was our outrageous gain and
we actually, truly, for once,
didn’t lose! We came third and
I got an individual 7th. A good
day for all.
A week later, it was our
turn to host the ceremony
and we were allowed to do it
at midday as opposed to stu-
pid o’clock. This week Sarah
was replaced by Jess. Now,
the point of home competi-
tions is a home advantage.
Or so I have always been led
to believe. However I feel as
though I have been lied to. For
all the money I spent learning
how to ride Pablo, I may as
well have not bothered as we
didn’t produce the goods. Kat
rode Sushi: I didn’t see it but
unfortunately someone else
did amazing on that pony so
Kat suffered numerous penal-
ties. Jess and Storm did fine
and Jess got the best score,
meaning no penalties. El and
Lily performed a good, test
even though Lily resembles
a mule. Can you guess what
came next? Yes, lunchtime
followed by jumping. Can you
see the pattern?
While we ate, we watched
(some with excitement, some
with apprehension) as the
jumping course was erected.
The aforementioned emo-
tions increased as the A team
demonstrated how good our
horses can be. BJ, Flash and
Trio wowed the other teams
with their speed and agil-
ity. Avignon caused people
to bury faces in sleeves to
stop laughter being heard.
OK, so it wasn’t that bad but
she did just blankly refuse to
jump and so enter Shannyn
‘squeals-like-a-pig’ to act as a
replacement.
The long and the short of it
was that our jumping course
caused numerous problems.
There were poles down eve-
rywhere and a few refusals
thrown in for good measure.
But us IC girls came out tops
and won ourselves another
third place, Jess got herself
an individual 2nd and I got an
individual 5th. So again, not a
completely failed day.
Finally the last competition
was held in Farnham, home
to the Surrey girls. We arrived
ridiculously early thanks to
Luke, our chauffeur for the
day. What have I said about
early mornings? Throw in
the fact that it was hover-
ing around two degrees and
I was not the happiest bunny.
The Reading girls got lost en
route, delaying the start of the
fight... I mean competition.
The horses weren’t anything
special and there’s nothing
to really say about them. We
did what we try to do best
but usually end up failing at,
and went to work on the dres-
sage tests. No-one appeared
to do terribly on our side. The
judge once again thought oth-
erwise, and the marking was
extremely questionable which
didn’t improve the bleak day.
Lunch was terrible. And
jumping just capped it off. The
course was NOT an actual
course. It was just numerous
randomly numbered jumps
which happened, by chance,
to be spatially similar in terms
of being enclosed by the same
fence. It caused us to force
the horses to bend in ways
that would make a Cirque du
Soleil contortionist wince.
Needless to say, the jump-
ing was humorous but not
beneficial to our team score.
Jess barely managed to drag
her tired and flat-footed steed
around and took several poles
and jump wings with her. I
got one pole down on the
pro-show jumper who was
minus an important piece of
tack (in my opinion), El had
a similar round and Kat took
on ‘Georgina Ballerina’, who
could be likened to one of the
hippos from Fantasia, but all
went well. And the results? A
not unexpected fourth place
for Imperial College, with Kat
and El getting 7th and 6th
place respectively in the indi-
viduals.
So that was that. Final count
for Imperial: two third places,
two fourths and a smattering
of individuals. We lost of the
league, RVC won the league
but fun was had by all. At
least, I hope we all had fun.
Fun tended to be had most by
me in the Union later those
Wednesday evenings. The
Union encourages me to drink
responsibly, but seeing as I
had to drink for four people...

What a nail-biting finish to
the ULU League! ULU ladies’
premier two teams battled
it out on Monday night at
Harlington in a match where
everything was at stake. IC
had to beat GKT to stay in
contention to win the league,
while GKT only had to draw
or win to gain top spot.
The match started with
Imperial dominating play,
moving the ball decisively
around the pitch and creating
a decent array of chances. A
shock goal from GKT against
the run of play in the first half
took the wind out of IC’s sails
for a while, but they fought on
relentlessly, building play and
looking the sharper team.
Still 1-0 down at half time,
but full of optimisim, IC
again set the pace after the
restart.
It wasn’t long before some
promising pressing play was
rewarded by a short corner
in the Imperial side’s favour,
and Helene Wehrmann put a
venomous shot in the bottom
right corner to bring it back
level.
The cold of the night and
murmurs of flu took their toll
for a while, as IC were forced
to absorb some pressure
themselves, with GKT deter-
mined not to be made to look
stupid. Two rather unfortu-
nate goals were conceded by
IC as concentration lapsed,
and they found themselves
3-1 down.
It took a second delightful
through pass fromWehrmann
to the slick stick of Roxy FP
for IC to pull back a slither of
hope and bring the score to a
more respectable 3-2.
Then, with ten minutes
remaining, Helene really did
have the goal in her sights
that night, working even more
magic with a second short
corner conversion, making it
all even at 3-3.
IC knew that a draw sim-
ply wasn’t good enough, and
in the dying minutes Helene
and Roxy joined forces again,
with Roxy’s touch on a fly-
ing pass from midfield just
enough to send the ball over
her shoulder and that of the
rooted GKT ‘keeper. A sure
contender for goal of the sea-
son, not to mention the fact
that it won the game for IC at
a tense 4-3 final scoreline.
Whilst Roxy and Helene
stole the show in terms of
goal scoring, the defeat of
GKT was at the hands of a
formidible team effort, and
everyone played exception-
ally well.
Now all that remains is to
beat them again in the final of
the ULU Cup when we have a
full strength team... bring on
those GKT Medics!
