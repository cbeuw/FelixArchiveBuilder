German bid for London Stock
Exchange stops short
After mounting pressure from shareholders, the CEO of the Deutsche Boerse
exchange buckled and stopped his bid. Numaan Chaudhry excogitates
The start of this week saw
Deutsche Boerse AG, the
primary stock exchange
in Germany, drop its pro-
posed bid to pay £1.3bn for
the London Stock Exchange
(LSE) after continual share-
holder opposition to Chief
Executive Werner Seifert’s
acquisition plan.
Dissident shareholders
now own between 50% to 60%
of Deutsche Boerse’s stock,
according to public state-
ments from involved firms,
private letters of opposition
sent to Deutsche Boerse and
people familiar with the mat-
ter.
The move to abandon the
bid raises questions about the
future of Mr Seifert, who has
once before tried, and indeed
failed, to buy the LSE in his
long-term drive to outpace
the European rival exchange
operator Euronext and kick-
start consolidation among
European stock exchanges.
Mr Seifert faces an arduous
task of repairing badly frayed
relations with a majority of
shareholders of the German
stock exchange operator as a
result of the bid.
The change in the bid
marked a stunning reversal,
as Mr Seifert’s talks to buy
LSE have been public since
last December.
Now Deutsche Boerse’s
exit leaves open the door for
Euronext to buy the London
exchange. However, unlike
German law, both LSE and
Euronext would have to seek
shareholder approval for a
takeover or merger under,
respectively, UK and Dutch
laws.
In a statement on Monday
evening, Deutsche Boerse
said it reserves the right to
return with a new offer if LSE
is made an offer, from another
exchange or otherwise.
Pressure on Mr Seifert had
mounted. Some of the dis-
sident shareholders had pub-
licly said they are preparing
an attempt to vote out the
company’s supervisory board
at its annual shareholders’
meeting, which is set for May.
The structure in Germany
is slightly different as firms
have two boards: a superviso-
ry board of mostly non-execu-
tive directors and a manage-
ment board of ‘insider’ direc-
tors.
“We strongly believe the
majority of shareholders are
publicly and privately against
this deal and the company is
aware of this,” was the opin-
ion of a partner at TCI, a
stakeholder of this deal. They
commented after Deutsche
Boerse’s decision as an indi-
cation as to what course of
action the dissident share-
holders might now take.
Many dissident sharehold-
ers argued in recent days that
acquiring LSE would have
destroyed shareholder value
and that the company’s cash
pile of more than 600m euros
might be better spent buying
back its own shares and pay-
ing out higher dividends.
Some dissidents said they
had no choice but to seek
the board’s removal because
Deutsche Boerse has refused
to put its decision to acquire
LSE to a shareholder vote.
The battle dividing
Deutsche Boerse is the lat-
est instance of hedge funds
buying up stakes in compa-
nies that are in the midst of
acquisition bids in an attempt
to influence the outcome of
a deal. In Deutsche Boerse’s
case, however, the fight has
spread to include other major
and prestigious investors
such as Fidelity Investments.
The clash showcases how
European shareholders are
starting to take a more active
role, something they have
lagged behind US investors
in doing.
While the rebellion has
been led by UK and US
hedge funds, such as TCI and
Atticus Capital, a number of
significant institutional inves-
tors have joined rank, includ-
ing Fidelity, Merrill Lynch
Investment Managers and
Generali Asset Management.
In addition to those heavy-
weight investors, two large
US institutions with big hold-
ings in Deutsche Boerse sig-
nalled to management over
the weekend that they, too,
opposed an LSE takeover.
Mr Seifert, along with
Deutsche Boerse’s supervi-
sory-board chairman, Rolf
Breuer, who is also chair-
man of Deutsche Bank AG,
had played down the threat
posed by dissident sharehold-
ers, arguing that a majority
of shareholders supported
an LSE acquisition, in recent
weeks.
But support has been
quite meagre, with just two
big shareholders, Union
Investment of Germany and
State Street Global Advisors,
stating their backing for an
LSE bid.
Recently, the rebels appear
to have the momentum.
Deutsche Boerse’s shares
last week traded at volumes
twice the typical daily aver-
age, the bulk of trades being
conducted by hedge funds
attempting to make gains by
betting that Mr Seifert would
be either forced out or back
down from an LSE bid, open-
ing the door to share buy-
backs that could boost the
stock’s value.
