In February, the Kyoto
Protocol limped comically
into effect, and for those
who believe generally in the
predictions of science, the
decrepitude of Kyoto hurts
like a laughter stitch. It is
pathos at its most excruciat-
ing. It is a satire on itself.
For thirteen aching years, the
creators of the agreement
have been at the throbbing
nexus of economic, scientific
and political information.
Armed with the sword of
reason, and set against a
backdrop of impending dis-
aster, these trusty guardians
of our future have tirelessly
negotiated the Protocol’s
details. They’ve thrusted,
they’ve parried, they’ve com-
promised, they’ve traded,
they’ve amended, they’ve
pushed and they’ve pulled
and they’ve come up with a
reduction in global green-
house gas emissions of 4.8%
below the 1990 level.
Most scientists in a position
to comment will tell you this
isn’t enough. In fact it’s hilari-
ous in its inadequacy. It’s
‘duck and cover’ for human-
ity. Even if it were to be fully
implemented for 100 years it
wouldn’t be enough. Even if
it included the United States,
China, India and Australia, it
wouldn’t be enough.
In fact, plot the predicted
temperature rise over time
with no reduction in carbon
emissions next to the tem-
perature rise with the Kyoto
targets and the lines stay as
close as Laurel and Hardy.
But here’s the punchline: the
protocol is set to expire in
2012 and, due to American
sabotage, no plans have yet
been made for a replace-
ment.
As if that weren’t painful
enough, some critics esti-
mate that this piecemeal ges-
ture will cost $1 trillion. So
geared is the global economy
to the release of carbon into
the atmosphere that even
this vague attempt towards
sustainability costs roughly
4% of the sum of all involved
countries’ GDPs. This is why
the US doesn’t want to get
involved.
Some in the US are also
concerned that Kyoto is
European and Eastern impe-
rialism through the back door
(which is funny when set
against the imperialist impli-
cations of one twentieth of
the world’s population using a
quarter of its energy output),
but mainly – to paraphrase
Bill Clinton, one among many
to torment Kyoto – it’s the
stupid economy.
And here lies the central
paradox, which is the corner-
stone of this epic tragicom-
edy. All our main economic
models are based on an infi-
nite amount of resources and
an infinite capacity for pol-
lution to provide everlasting
economic expansion. This
is the banana skin. This is
what’s providing the laughs.
It’s Basil Fawlty’s despera-
tion, David Brent’s vanity and
Frank Spencer’s well-mean-
ing clumsiness together.
Science, it is assumed, will
provide the answers to make
economies grow forever.
But it’s now science that
is telling us that there just
aren’t infinite resources on
the planet and there isn’t
infinite capacity for pollu-
tion. Kyoto’s feeble doddering
comes from trying to square
an infinite model with a finite
world. And, to someone who
believes in science, it seems
that the economic model has
to change in some way. I don’t
know how, but there has to
be someone out there clever
enough to work it out, if only
because the hapless fumbling
of international policy-mak-
ers is becoming less and less
funny.
Oh, Kyoto! What a complete farce
Without US participation and with targets set far below the levels demanded by scientists,
Richard Fenning asks how anyone could take the Kyoto protocol seriously
Alternative medicines on trial
Do alternative therapies have any scientific basis?
Elena Lengthorn went to the Royal Institution to find out
This debate, one of the Royal
Institution’sfirstpublicevents
of the year, was inspired by
the publication of Times col-
umnist Toby Murcott’s book
The Whole Story: Alternative
medicine on trial?
Expert witnesses came in
the form of Murcott himself;
Dr Mike Cummings, medi-
cal director of the Medical
Acupuncture Society (MAS);
and Dr Andrew Moore, edi-
tor of eBandolier.com, a
website on evidence-based
health care. During one of
the Institution’s Talking
Point events, the public were
encouraged to quiz the speak-
ers, and the questions were
ably directed from the chair
by writer and broadcaster
Vivienne Parry.
Murcott, one-time bio-
chemist, began the event by
reminding the audience that
complementary medicine
worked alongside to Western
medicine and not a replace-
ment. Alternative medicines
cannot be tested in the same
way as conventional drugs.
The issue at stake for Murcott
was not whether the alter-
natives work, but whether
science can measure them
working. He also suggested
that more individualised
alternative treatments create
a better relationship between
the practitioner and patient.
If a little massage therapy
is making the difference and
doing the trick then why not
use it?
A show of hands revealed
that over 50% of the audience
in the auspicious Faraday
Lecture Theatre had under-
gone some form of comple-
mentary treatment. Clearly,
more and more people are
claiming benefits from
alternative treatments, and
Murcott would like to see sci-
ence applied to verify them.
The second speaker of the
evening was Mike Cummings,
a former RAF Medical Officer
who, bizarrely, learnt acu-
puncture during his service.
Despite little favourable evi-
dence at the time, he was
keen to continue with practis-
ing the therapy after success
with some difficult cases.
After leaving the military and
taking over an acupuncture
clinic, he started looking for
scientific evidence for acu-
puncture and doing his own
research. Cummings claims
that 85% of modern medicine
does not have the sort of evi-
dence that is demanded of
acupuncture.
Finally, Andrew Moore, the
man with the evidence, crys-
tallsied the debate down to
two things, claiming the data
available was inadequate and
over-sold. He provided com-
pelling examples, including a
widely cited study on tennis
elbow in the Rheumatology
journal based on six trials.
One was not randomised,
another two were not ‘double
blind’ (when both the patient
and the practitioner are
‘blind’ to the treatment being
given) and one was invalid.
Warming to his theme, Moore
accused the well-known
Cochrane Collaboration, a
non-profit outfit who provide
information on the effects of
health care, of over-selling.
He also suggested that evi-
dence that acupuncture can
be dangerous and has injured
patients exists. Although this
point was not disputed, the
small numbers involved were
invoked: there have been an
estimated ten deaths to date.
The event really brought
the lecture hall to life, with
the audience clamouring for
Vivienne’s attention, and even
shouting from the upper gal-
lery to get questions heard.
The alternative therapists in
the audience were desperate
to tell their stories, as were
those who had received treat-
ment.
One couple enthusiasti-
cally recounted the tale of a
neighbour’s dog who received
acupuncture once a month.
Whether the ardour of the
audience reflected general
public opinion, or just the
interest of those attracted to
the event, was unclear. What
was startlingly obvious from
the beginning was that many
in the audience didn’t need or
want evidence, just to share
their experiences. For them,
at least, anecdotal evidence
was enough.
Kyoto: when it comes down to it, isn’t it all a bit of a joke?
As you all know, this year is
Einstein Year.
Aside from the plethora
of events being organised
around the globe to cele-
brate physics, PhySoc have
also been heavily involved in
organising things. As part of
an outreach programme, stu-
dents have ventured into local
schools and given a series of
lessons and demonstrations
on physics.
In addition, this Saturday
is the Big Day of Physics at
Imperial’s physics depart-
ment. People from all over
London are welcome to
attend. There are plans for
a two hour challenge to take
place in the morning, where
schoolchildren from the out-
reach programme will build
demonstrations on various
physical concepts.
After lunch and a judging
session, there will be lectures
running for the more mature
audience, including topics
such as Life As A Quantum
Mechanic and Physics And
Creativity. Whilst the lec-
tures go on, there will be a
simultaneous series of small-
er seminars and group dis-
cussions – two on environ-
mental issues, one on music
and one on life as a physics
student. There will also be
lab tours running every half
hour, so you can see MAGPIE
in action for yourself, revel in
the delights that are super-
conductors and see the infa-
mous lasers in optics!
If you’d like to help in any
shape or form, or would like

Day, email Brett Manning on
