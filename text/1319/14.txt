CLUBS & SOCIETIES felix@ic.ac.uk
By Louisa Evans
Did anyone notice those three
large, white trucks parked up
by the Sherfield Building?
One of them had a microwave
dish sticking out of the top,
with the sacred markings of
the media on it: ‘BBC’. Simply
looking upon the three letters
brought thrills of excitement
to the passers-by: I know,
I saw you all turning your
heads in excitement – I was
watching you from the walk-
way!
The political heavyweight of
the televisual airwaves was in
London. Question Time had
arrived at our very own Great
Hall. Kept that quiet, didn’t
they?!
Well, I suppose it is under-
standable really. They
wouldn’t want a bunch of
nosy students rocking up and
pestering them with excited
questions, would they? Well,
I ignored what my common
sense was screaming at me
and went behind the scenes
to watch how a real television
programme is put together.
The setup started at 7.30am
and by 10am the set was built,
the lighting rigged and the
gleaming white letters say-
ing ‘London’ had been laid
out ready for inspection by
the set designer, Paul Devine.
No one was overly impressed
when some careless footwork
on my part sent them flying
so they had to be relaid, but
the crew were looking a bit
bored so I thought I’d give
them something to do.
The set designer took me
through the setup stage by
stage. To light the four guests
and David Dimbleby took
no less than 72 individual
lights. Sound was provided
by two sets of microphones
for each of the panellists and
six boom mikes over various
areas of the audience and, in
total, 30 people were need-
ed to get the show on the
air. This made me stop and
think. Maybe that’s where
we’ve been going wrong at
STOIC (Student Television Of
Imperial College). We usually
have one guy on sound, one
on each camera (often just
one) and one guy to do vision
mixing and directing (obvi-
ously slightly redundant – or
so we thought – with only one
camera). Hmm.
It wasn’t until later that the
really exciting kit arrived, in
the shape of eight large for-
mat cameras and one ‘glam
cam’ – a guy dressed in black
running about the stage with
a hugely complicated but
impressively effective steadi-
cam, followed closely behind
by a guy carrying the cables.
It doesn’t sound like a great
job description, but it was fast
work and you get to be on tel-
evision loads!
Shortly after everything
was plugged in, the floor man-
ager called us over to actu-
ally sit as the panel to finalise
the camera shots to be used,
the lighting and the sound.
Very cool. I didn’t dare move,
but just about the best bit
was when they did a steadi-
cam rehearsal for the title
sequence.
“Cue music! And go!” and
the Question Time theme
tune rang out over our heads
as the lights came up. Even
cooler.
Probably the most amusing
events of the day in hindsight
was when one of the crew
approached me rather ten-
tatively and asked if I was
Karen. Before I could reply
she said, “...because there
are two guys from Special
Branch looking for you down
there, can you go and talk to
them?”
I practically jumped out of
my seat. I definitely wasn’t
Karen and on no account
did I want to be mistaken for
anyone who was wanted by
Special Branch!
“Err, no!” I stammered.
The woman asking me was
taken aback by my abrupt, if
faltering, response, “gosh no,
I don’t know who Karen is, I’m
just a student!” It wasn’t until
later that it dawned on me.
Far from seeking out a fugi-
tive who had gone into hiding
at Imperial College, the two
police officers were probably
interested in the fact that
the Home Secretary, Charles
Clarke MP
, and the shadow
home secretary, David Davis
MP
, were about to show up.
Dimbleby himself arrived a
few hours before the show
was to go on air. It was really
interesting seeing him walk
on set. A bit stereotypically, he
was followed by an entourage
of trendily-dressed young
ladies gushing at him about
how great it was to see him
etc, and as soon as he arrived
all the newspaper-reading
loungers seemed to sit up a
bit more straight and a hush
descended on the crew. Well,
to some extent. The uber-cool
pointedly ignored his arrival
in an ‘I-know-you’re-here-but-
I’m-choosing-to-ignore-you’
way.
There was definitely a
change in atmosphere in
response to Dimbleby’s arriv-
al though. He did a couple
of interviews for them (more
ever-so-grateful gushing) and
then moved on to recording
the trailer for the show to be
broadcast in only a couple of
hours, before the news. He
was a lot more playful and
light-hearted than I imag-
ined – the serious, hard-hit-
ting Dimbleby seemed to be
reserved for the politicians
only, and I felt very smug at
that. He clearly enjoyed his
work and spoke of how it was
very important for the BBC
to keep the public informed
of global events that changed
the lives of thousands of peo-
ple as well as the domestic
politics hitting our headlines
on most days.
The trailer took only two
takes, with the minimal
amount of fuss and both-
er. Then it was down to
rehearsals. Again, I was a
little bemused – Dimbleby,
rehearsing? But it was true:
I saw it with my own eyes. I
even recorded it with STOIC’s
own camera, until he start-
ed waving his hand at me
and pointing urgently as the
theme tune rolled out once
again. At first I thought he
was just being friendly, even
humouring me. Then I real-
ised it wasn’t quite a cheeky
glint in his eye and I dropped
the camera out of sight, like a
paparazzi caught red-handed.
He was fairly jovial about it,
explaining to me that rehears-
als are, in fact, confidential
and asked me who I was film-
ing for. I gushed and giggled
out an answer, much to my
own embarrassment. All the
cameras were trained on me
at the time – this wasn’t how
I had wanted to introduce
myself!
Rehearsals were pretty
quick and we were sat in
the audience and grilled by
Dimbleby (again – but in a
nice way) as part of the sound
check. That was pretty excit-
ing too. The topic of the day
was the case of the young
Muslim girl who had won the
case against her school about
her wish to wear a more
modest uniform in accord-
ance with her view of Islam.
I thought I had the subject off
pat, but when you get pointed
at by the man himself and the
whole crew is silent (with the
director in the outside broad-
cast truck outside), it feels
like being interrogated by the
Gestapo! I was truly in awe of
his superpowers.
I got to chat to Dimbleby
after the rehearsals were
over on a PR venture promot-
ing STOIC. He was quite sur-
prised – and impressed
– to find that we did all of our
work for the sheer love of it
and didn’t get any accredi-
tation towards our degrees.
I stopped short of giving
him a business card though
(I got them done for free at
VistaPrint, trouble is, that’s
exactly what they say on the
back). Besides, I had given
one to Paul Devine earlier in
the day, and he’d even come
over to our studio... obviously
to see who his closest rivals
in the ruthless world of media
were and steal our secrets.
The show went on air at
10.35pm. Apart from the bit
when Charles Clarke MP
dropped his tie-clip micro-
phone and nearly burst our
eardrums, the recording
looked ridiculously easy.
Everything ran so smoothly.
Almost like a STOIC produc-
tion. It had made for a pretty
informative and very excit-
ing day for all – Dimbleby
had never imagined getting
on STOIC.
Dramsoc helped the crew
take down their kit, and real-
ity fell upon us all once more.
The tantalising, heady touch
of the media world had passed
and, as we stood there, wav-
ing the trucks off into the
moonlight, we all shared the
same thought. Could we put
this on our CVs as work expe-
rience if we applied to the
BBC?
