BUSA Clay Shooting
Championships 2005
By Geoffrey Quint
Saturday 26 February saw
the hosting of the BUSA Clay
Shooting Championships
2005, the most anticipated
competition of the shooting
calendar. In accordance with
the traditional popularity of
the event within the rifle club,
Imperial once again entered
three men’s teams and a
ladies’ team with a total of 16
competitors.
We set off from South Ken
around 5.20pm on the Friday
evening. Happily, we ended up
arriving only 20 minutes late,
but unfortunately this would
prove to be the closest we ran
to schedule all weekend.
Despite our lateness, we
were still registered before
half of our competitors. All
of the teams opened with the
flush – 100 clays launched
randomly from a choice of
five fixed traps and shot as a
group of four guns.
Following the flush, the
group split into their teams to
shoot the 50 bird sporting. The
standard proved challenging
this year, with the first teams
shooting the Championship
course, which was more dif-
ficult than the Trophy course
shot by the others. All of our
teams preformed better than
this time last year, but we
still leave plenty of room to
progress.
Thereweresomereallynote-
worthy results from Imperial.
Tim Aplin finished joint 6th in
the country with 38 out of 50.
Tristan Carmichael was close
behind with 37, which was
good enough for joint 11th.
Finally, Konrad Skorko really
outshot his position in the 3rd
team with a 33; a score better
than any of his colleagues in
the second team and putting
him joint 18th in the Trophy
competition.
An exciting weekend fin-
ished in the Union where all
enjoyed some well-deserved
drinks. I really cannot wait to
do it all again next year.
