Had any one heard of the Arts
Fest until a few weeks ago? I
certainly hadn’t, but that out-
rageously pukish pink public-
ity campaign somehow man-
aged to get over 250 people to
attend the variety show that
was the Arts Fest 2005 Finale
Concert.
As well as more tradition-
ally ‘artsy’ items such as per-
formances by Imperial Brass,
Sinfonietta and IC String
Ensemble, the Finale Concert
showcased everything from
dance to martial arts.
The highlight for me was
the capoeira demonstration.
I’m not sure anyone in the
audience had ever seen or
heard of the Brazilian martial
art before. Everyone seemed
enthralledbytheuniquefusion
of South American music, self
defence and dance. There
were certainly a few worried
looks and gasps from the
crowd when the Capoeiristas
started bashing their swords
together... I’m not sure the
Union steward standing next
to me, shifting in his boots,
enjoyed it so much.
With entertaining, and at
times off the wall, commen-
tary from the evening’s hosts,
Alyona Andreicheva and
Neville Tam (both dressed to
the nines), the show was a
great demonstration of the
range and quality of perform-
ing arts at Imperial College.
A special mention should go
to Lara West, a dancer with
Dance Company who broke
her foot in their last piece
but carried on valiantly to the
end. Her dedication is admi-
rable!
The Arts Fest 2005 week
opened on the Monday with
a “folding session” in the
JCR at lunchtime by Origami
Society, which was followed
in the evening by a Chamber
Music Concert. Although the
attendance was reasonable,
the high standard of ensem-
bles deserved a bigger audi-
ence.
The Jazz and Rock gig
night featured sets from four
bands playing music ranging
from ska to blues rock. At the
night’s peak, White Elephant
were performing to an appre-
ciative audience of over 130
people. My personal high-
light was the ska band Circus
Penguin, who I thought were
worthy of a later slot.
The Dance Extravaganza
on Wednesday afternoon had
a disappointing attendance,
perhaps due to the business
of sporting activities, but I
guess not many people knew
what exactly to expect from
such a vaguely branded event.
The 30 or so who did turn
up had more than a pleasant
surprise, finding free intro-
ductory lessons in capoeira,
breakdancing, hip-hop, con-
temporary dance, latin and
salsa which ran all afternoon
– it should have been named
the Dance Marathon.
Later that day, over 150
charitable souls attended the
Tsunami Appeal Concert fea-
turing Symphony Orchestra,
Choir and Big Band.
Considering that the event
was free, with voluntary dona-
tions only, the total of over
£450 was astounding and was
testament to the generosity of
Imperial students and staff.
Jazz Big Band as usual
pulled in the crowds and
performed their ‘Atomic Big
Band’ show to a packed dBs.
It’s a pity that the Union isn’t
always this bustling, as a fant-
abulous night was had by all.
Much overlooked, but
not forgotten, was the Art
ExhibitionintheBlythGallery.
Not only was I impressed by
the quality, but also the imagi-
nation evident in the works
displayed, all of which were
by Imperial students.
In summary, I felt that Arts
Fest 2005 was a week of high
quality, fun and free events
which perhaps deserved
more notice.
It remains to be seen wheth-
er Arts Fest 2005 will be suc-
cessful in getting more people
interested in artistic pursuits,
as was its aim. Certainly the
attendance was improved at
the established events such
as Jazz & Rock and Big Band
gigs, but the uptake on some
of the new events such as the
Dance Extravaganza was less
impressive. Was it because it
was all branded as ‘Arts Fest’,
which certainly made some
passers-by refuse flyers with-
out a second glance at what
free events were on offer?
Regardless, I am looking
forwards to what Arts Fest
2006 might have in store.
All new Arts Fest ends on a high
