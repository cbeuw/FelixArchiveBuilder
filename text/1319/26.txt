From the director of the hugely
successful Gladiator comes this
year’s early summer blockbuster
– an epic of gigantic proportions
named Kingdom of Heaven. It is of
reassurance that Ridley Scott – the
master of modern epics – will be
directing this. Scott has claimed
himself that this production will be
“even grander than Gladiator.” The
film boasts a strong cast, featuring
Orlando Bloom, Liam Neeson, Eva
Green, Jeremy Irons, David Thewlis
and Brendan Gleeson, to name but
a few.
Set in 12th century Europe and
the Middle East, this movie epic
tells the story of a young peasant
(Orlando Bloom) thrust into a long
war. Serving a doomed king and
eventually rising up to knighthood,
he finds himself faced with the
daunting task of protecting the peo-
ple of Jerusalem against external
threats whilst trying to keep peace
across the land. All this while fall-
ing in love with an exotic princess
(Green). In short and from the trail-
er, it looks like the product of three
epic films – Gladiator, Alexander
and A Knight’s Tale – thrown togeth-
er. However, given the current situ-
ation in the world today, it will be
interesting to see how Scott has
dealt with the sensitive issue of the
Crusades whilst still being histori-
cally accurate.
Judging by the trailers, the film
seems to follow Scott’s previous
work – Kingdom of Heaven cer-
tainly does look like a visually grand
masterpiece. The trailer shows dra-
matic landscape shots of amassing
armies and powerful battle scenes
interspersed with lines of poignant
dialogue. The soundtrack accompa-
nying the trailer gives the musically
inclined amongst us something to
look forward to: Harry Gregson-
Williams has produced a very atmos-
pheric and moving score not dissimi-
lar to the soundtrack accompanying
Gladiator. Why exactly Scott did not
keep Hans Zimmer, the composer
of Gladiator’s soundtrack, on this
project is still unclear. It is inter-
esting to note that although Scott
decided to replace Zimmer with
Gregson-Williams, the exact oppo-
site occurred for the scoring duties
of Madagascar.
The acting talent seems promis-
ing. Liam Neeson looks particularly
fitting as Godfrey of Ibelin, and Eva
Green does a commendable job of
looking like the hauntingly beautiful
yet vulnerable and forbidden prin-
cess. Orlando Bloom – the protago-
nist of the film – is the only one I still
have issues with, however. True, he
does manage to look convincingly
rugged in some of the shots as the
young valiant knight. Still, though,
he delivers his lines with a stilted
forcedness that makes me cringe. I
think giving awe-inspiring pre-battle
speeches is just not his thing. Let’s
hope he doesn’t throw us another
wooden performance reminiscent of
those he gave us in Pirates of the
Caribbean and Troy – maybe then
Kingdom of Heaven might just live
up to its hype. Marya Ziauddin

Has Orlando Bloom been in a movie that wasn’t set in the past?
Repair for adventure!
The Academy Award winning direc-
tor of the worldwide smash hit Ice
Age, Chris Wedge, brings you this
ground-breaking, spectacular, three-
dimensional world, taking animation
to a new level.
It’s set in a world full of mechani-
cal walking talking robots! To make
things better, about five Oscar win-
ners have been brought in to voice
the robots, each with their own
distinctive personality. Characters
include the idealistic robot Rodney
Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor)
who tries to convince his electronic
mates to come together and make
the world better; a beautiful execu-
tive Cappy (Halle Berry); the despi-
cable corporate tormenter Ratchet
(Greg Kinnear); a master inven-
tor Bigweld (Mel Brooks) who has
lost his way; and a group of mis-
fits known as the Rusties led by
Fender (Robin Williams) and Piper
Pinwheeler (Amanda Bynes).
Fender’s head, arms and legs rou-
tinely fall off at the most inconven-
ient moments and as Rodney fulfills
Fender’s ongoing need for repairs,
the two become great friends. Piper
is Fender’s tomboy sister, who sur-
prises everyone with her determina-
tion and strength.
The story continues with Rodney
having two main dreams. One is to
make the world a better place and
the other is to meet his most adored
idol, Bigweld. On his way, he meets
Cappy who catches his interest.
Despite his good intentions, Rodney
ends up facing opposition from an
evil corporation lead by Big Weld
and finds some unlikely allies in the
form of a ragtag group, the misfit
robots, as he tries to make robots
capable of making the world a bet-
ter place.
On first impression, Robots doesn’t
come over too well. It is supposed to
be a comedic tale but somehow it
doesn’t go in that direction. Yes, it is
from the director of the well known
hilarious Ice Age, but the trailer
doesn’t really set it off right. A robot
says: “I know this place like the back
of my hand”, then looks at his hand
and says “hey, that’s new!”. Imagine
how long that took to come up with.
But with Chirs Wedge, the expecta-
tion is high; though it doesn’t seem
so funny.
As is always said, never judge a
book by its cover. After all, it’s sup-
pose to be a heart-warming story
that proves that a robot can shine
no matter what he or she is made
of. Well, if you would like to see what
Chris Wedge has done or see how a
world might exist if it was complete-
ly inhabited by robots (what would
it look like? how would the robots
act?) then go and see this film.
