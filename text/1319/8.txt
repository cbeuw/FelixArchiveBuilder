Neighbours has to be Imperial stu-
dents’ most watched TV show. At
5.35pm every afternoon, students
can put away their books and relax
in front of a group of shoddy acting,
good looking Australians. Not only is
Neighbours fantastic telly, it brings
people together – if you’re still hav-
ing trouble meeting people in halls,
just start up a conversation about
Izzy’s illegitimate baby or the Sky-
Lana lesbianism.
Let’s not forget the lunchtime sit-
ting. Neighbours also airs at 1.40pm,
a highly inconvenient time as many
lectures start at 2pm – something I
think College should look into. Don’t
think that if you’ve managed to catch
the early edition there’s no point
watching it later. You’ll pick up on
all the underlying nuances, and will
be able to impress your mates with
amazing fortune-telling abilities.
Neighbours has been one of the
only stable influences in my life
– I’m not from a two parent family
anymore, but Neighbours has stood
by me since year four of primary
school. Our parents had the Beatles,
our grandparents WWII. We have
Neighbours!
But does my 16-year relationship
(outstripping any sexual relation-
ship I’ve had by more than 15 years)
have to come to an end? Thousands
of final year students are facing not
only the daunting prospect of hav-
ing to get a job, but the far more
heart-stopping realisation that once
they get said job they will miss both
sittings of daily nourishment. I for
one found this such a burden that
I’ve put off getting a proper job for
another year.
For those of you who haven’t
been able to secure sabbatical posi-
tions, don’t worry – I’m fighting for
Neighbours to be rescheduled or
for an omnibus edition at the week-
end. I’ve emailed and called Mark
Thompson, BBC Director-General,
but, alas, to no avail.
Told to swear allegiance to
the nation
Recently the Government released
plans for every child in the country
to swear allegiance to the UK when
they turn 18. The idea being that if
we had all stood up, listened to the
national anthem and said something
along the lines of “As a British citizen,
I affirm my loyalty to Britain and its
people”, then we would all respect
each other and the world would be a
better place. Hardly likely, is it?
How does Charles Clarke, Home
Secretary, expect young people to
swear allegiance to a government
that has consistently ignored their
opinions on the war in Iraq, and
higher education?
Is swearing an oath in the British
mentality? Are you proud to be
British? I can imagine people being
happy to swear an oath of national-
ism in overtly patriotic countries,
such as the US and Australia. But
not in Britain. I am more ashamed
of objects of nationalism than proud.
The flag of St George has been
seized by the far right as a symbol
of racism.
Are we even a United Kingdom?
Would Scottish, Welsh and Northern
Irish people be comfortable swear-
ing allegiance to a Britain they might
not feel part of?

The Neighbours generation
by RUPERT NEATE
Looking back, dear readers, I can-
not quite fathom exactly how last
week’s entry came about. Stormy is
horny (again), and out on the prowl.
The object of last week’s affec-
tion has revealed himself to be an
uptight philistine, completely unable
to cope with a couple of paranoia-
inducing prank emails and dirty text
messages. He’s got so angry over
what, to me, is an exercise in jest,
and is completely avoiding a good
friend of mine, who, to be fair, sent
him non-anonymous ego-flattering
messages, rather than insults. Alas.
My mother’s test – making a guy
angry, to see whether he’d be violent
or psychotic towards you – has been
failed miserably.
This, along with his non-existent
erection and permanent beer gut,
seem to come along with smoking
a small greenhouse-worth of wacky
baccy every week for the past four
years. Stoners are not for Stormy.
It’s not just my mother who has
a test. There’s my very own one,
which determines whether a guy
will understand me or not. It’s based
around reactions to a very sick joke,
which as a medic I really shouldn’t
be laughing hysterically at. The only
chap I’ve ever had true feelings for
laughed at it for ages and saw the
sardonic humour in such a dark
image.
What’s funnier than a dead baby?
A dead baby in a clown suit.
Let me know whether you find it
funny too. No, really. No-one likes a
man who takes life too seriously!
Black humour aside, there’s only
one thing I want you all to focus on.
No, not the comparative failure of
‘Hospital Watch’, which has yielded
one Orlando Bloom lookalike with
hideous dress sense, adding more
amusement to the unexpected
appearances by gangster Sikh from
time to time. I really don’t under-
stand how somebody could think
that promoting a fundamentalist
agenda whilst quizzing a girl as to
what she’d like in a partner for the
entirety of the date would endear
himself to her. Similarly, rolling up
with a list of profoundly worrying
character traits, including the need
to carry weapons (the ceremonial
Sikh sword plus a pair of numchucks
from his days as a ‘professional wit-
ness’ at a known Rudeboy hotspot),
isn’t a conventional aphrodisiac in
any shape or form. Even the crimi-
nally insane amongst the female
population would run for the hills on
this one!
Alas, the pertinent question arises.
How much would one choose to lie/
embellish/exaggerate one’s achieve-
ments in order to get another into
bed? Conventional wisdom dictates
that women are drawn to capability,
and thus power. However, the people
with the most to offer tend to be the
most silent on this matter, and by
extension, the most single. Perhaps
relationships are for the more mis-
guided amongst us.
Apologies for having to bitch about
the considerable boasting I’ve had
to put up with this week – the week
the medics are forced to think about
their elective (studying abroad)
placements a whole fifteen months
away. It’s a shame that a placement
in England is looked upon unfavour-
ably, since we’ve got the leading
research institutes right upon our
doorstep. I could’ve sworn the pro-
posed IC-UCL merger would’ve let
us demolish the building midway
between them, and take over the
ruins of Buckingham Palace with
our new super-site. Alas, this is not
to be, since a key academic involved
in the merger plans is too busy
feasting his eyes amongst the cur-
rent second year talent.
I would consider heading over to
UCL to check out the talent, but
I’ve never met a more vacuous set
of good-looking guys in my life. Give
me the talented and funny Imperial
chap any day. Let’s forgive him once
more for boasting since he’s actually
made it so close to a girl (an experi-
ence which the current second year
in physics are currently celebrating
their Celtic friend with an unsettling
Asian fetish for doing!)
And it’s on that note, I’d like to
leave you. It’s the failures and mis-
haps that are the pillars of success.
From gangster Sikh to the humour-
less stoner, the only way is up!
The girl about town
by STORMY WOODS
Most of you know me as “the irritat-
ing guy in the back row that makes
lots of noise during classes”. But the
time has come for me to reveal my
true identity: I am a social anthro-
pologist researching at Imperial
College.
The main objectives of this col-
umn are to analyse and interpret the
behaviour of people at IC in general.
Day 1. The ratio
One of the reasons for the choice
of Imperial College as my research
environment is, obviously, the girl-
boy ratio. Yes, I bet most of you
haven’t realized, but we have an
astonishing 65 guys for every 35
girls! How lucky are we?
The purpose of this week’s article
is to consider the following ques-
tions:
1. Why do we have only 35% girls?
2. Where are those 35%?
3. How do boys behave?
4. Something else that I forgot now,
but I’ll include when I remember it.
Here’s my attempt at answering
those questions.
1. In case you haven’t noticed,
you’re studying at a so-called “col-
lege of science, technology and med-
icine”. So, what part of science and
technology (let’s forget medicine)
haven’t you understood?
Let’s put this in an easier way for
you to analyse:
Guys ñ science + technology
= abstract thinking ≠ (paint-
ing and colouring).(animals and
people).(decorating houses).(writing
and reading) = humanities and arts
ï Girls
So, if you were a girl, would you
prefer sciences to healing people
or expressing yourself artistically?
(If so, sorry, but you shouldn’t be
reading this article...)
Girls, unless they are real gen-
iuses or couldn’t get into medicine
or have some fetish for engineering,
don’t come to Imperial. (Don’t start
saying all that bollocks about equal-
ity and stuff, because we all know
this will continue to happen for at
least the next 30 years.)
2. Well, 35% is quite a lot! I can’t
quite remember the last time I saw
so many girls together (perhaps at
that party with South Kensington
firefighters’ unit? Or maybe the
Christmas I spent with the troops
in Iraq...)
But why does it seem to me that
this college only has about 7.3% of
females? I could be harsh and say
it’s because a big percentage of girls
here look like boys or because they
never leave their classrooms, but I’ll
leave this question open for you to
think about it.
3. This really embarrassing ratio,
the lowest on Earth right after the
percentage of girls working as taxi
drivers and postmen, can’t only be
the girls’ fault.
If we, guys, behave as we do (nerd-
ing a bit here, nerding a bit there, not
shaving, not putting in a minimum
effort with dressing up, not having
intelligent and sensible conversa-
tions, getting drunk and throwing
up all over Beit Quad), then the only
people we can blame for this miser-
able situation are ourselves.
So come on, start showering
once a week, buy a new second-
hand set of clothes in Portobello
Market, start reading poetry and
watching flowers blossom, and you
and I will see, in 3478925347825
years’ time, great changes taking
place (perhaps, and let’s be auda-
cious, raising the ratio to 37.3% to
62.7%). Let’s do it!
4. I still can’t remember anything
to put here, so I’ll leave it for next
time (if they let me continue writing
this outrageous column!)
PS. If you took this article too per-
sonally, I would recommend that you
get a life (you can start by buying a
sense of humour!)
