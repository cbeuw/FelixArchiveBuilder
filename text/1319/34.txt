After a season of continu-
ously being dicked on, the
almighty deIViants started
winning matches and we
want to share the goodness
with everyone. So here are
our victorious tales of deIVi-
ancy.
Imperial Men’s 4th 2
St Bart’s Men’s 3rd 0
We set out to Stepney Green
with a thirst for revenge as
memories of our last disas-
trous encounter were still
fresh.
The match started off with
frosty snow falling on the pitch
on a chillingly cold afternoon.
The first half was uneventful,
but the game soon livened up
in the second with credit due
to Zaidi and James.
Quite frankly, Zaidi rocks
on pitch for us. Supported
by a few ringers (mentioning
no names, Andreas, Rich F,
Charlie and Andrew) in mid-
field, we showed that we are
a force to be reckoned with,
so when James put the first
goal in from a sharp strike,
we were in for the kill.
As for St Bart’s, they were
good, but not good enough.
Azlan quickly picked out
their star player, giving Tim
and Tom the chance to force
many attacks. Continued
pressure pushed us further
ahead with a goal from James
‘Charlie’ ‘Will I ever live up
to my brother’s reputation’
Edge.
The defensive fort was
being held tight by Rich,
Andrew and Atul, who spoiled
any attacks. Not all credit can
be given to them though, as
we still have Doug, our wicket
keeper/goalkeeping star who
once again denied others the
satisfaction of calling him
‘Dirty Sheets’, wiping up any
chances that St Bart’s may
have had. We must also men-
tion a notable performance
from Ray in midfield, who is
proving to be once of the most
successful freshers ever to
grace DeIViant ranks.
It is always good to have
such a victory, however this
week’s result was particularly
sweet as after our last meet-
ing we went away robbed 3-3
after a last minute goal from
a penalty corner.
Imperial Men’s 4th 4
GKT Men’s 3rd 0
This was a monumental event
in deIViant history, as we
made friends with the oppo-
sition’s ladies’ team (or so
we’d like to think). But back
to the point, we won our first
BUSA match ever. No doubt
these winning memories will
be glorified in the hazy mists
of beer in the future!
Struggling to get a squad
in at the start of the match,
the deIViants were helped by
lady luck when the fifth team
match was abandoned. From
a feeble seven players, we
now had a magnificent 13.
The game began at a shock-
ingly slow pace, so much so
that captain Kirk retreated
back from his experimental
midfield position to defence
to chill with the gang at the
back. Fortunately James,
Andreas and JonnyQ showed
their dominance in mid-
field, keeping GKT in their
place. Their best chance only
occurred when captain Kirk
shot at his own net, trying to
chip our ’keeper Doug!
Andreas then quickly
saw GKT’s weak spots and
rammed two goals in. But
even with our 2-0 lead we
were not happy. JonnyQ
reminded us of recent draws
following from leading posi-
tions in his motivational half
time team talk. This talk must
have worked, as in the sec-
ond half we were much more
aggressive with Manish, Atul
and Ray making some fine
challenges to prevent their
attacks reaching our D.
The hero of this half was
Andreas again. With another
two goals, he thrusted us into
the lead. It must be noted that
Charlie faced GKT’s number
10 with passion resulting in
threats from the GKT nutter
such as “I will break your
legs” and “I will eat you
alive” before the said oppo-
sition player decided that
stealing our beloved Charlie’s
stick and throwing it off the
pitch would be best plan of
action. The official umpire,
meanwhile, was probably
daydreaming.
The game ended with a bar-
rage of short corners against
GKT. Sadly these were all
directed at Tim, who felt that
he could do a far better job
than the rest of us and then
single-handedly managed
to miss three short corner
opportunities in a row.
We then spent a few hours
in the pub with GKT, where
we successfully smashed
pin glasses, both insulted
and impressed GKT ladies,
and even learnt a few drink-
ing songs from their ladies’
squad to add to our repertoire
of deIViant tunes. Notable
points of the post-match cel-
ebrations involved Tim down-
ing four shots of gin when
Lauren asked him (funnily he
never drinks with us for some
reason), Ray and Andrew’s
‘pint through socks’ and
Doug’s party piece fineage
while drinking six shots of
gin. He also deIViantly man-
aged to lose control of his pint
and smash it on the floor.
Happy with our first BUSA
win and overall five points in
our first year in the BUSA
leagues, the fourths have fin-
ished the year in style and
the chant “IC IVths walk on
water” was sung out again to
lift those deIViant spirits up.

DeIViants start a winning streak
Imperial Medicals
Men’s 1st 0
Imperial Men’s 2nd 4
After relegation in BUSA,
the inquest into what went
wrong concluded that our
(Imperial Seconds’) mistake
was leaving Will in charge.
Even though he was only in
charge for one game, the boy
managed to relegate us, but
not content with that he also
had to personally score the
screamer of an own goal that
sank us. Special Will, very
special.
With the bizarre events
of this season’s BUSA fix-
tures behind us, Team
Bouncebackabilty needed
to rapidly accumulate some
points in the last few games
in the ULU league to avoid the
drop in both competitions.
If that wasn’t enough to get
the boys up for this game,
our opponents were medics.
And not just any medics, they
were our own medic first
team who were also firmly
lodged in the southern hemi-
sphere of ULU Premier 1. So
a six-pointer and a bit of old
school rivalry to boot looked
like making for an interest-
ing day.
Our skipper got up that
morning went out for a fry-up
in preparation for the game
at his local greasy spoon, but
was kidnapped by the Links
boys and was next seen wad-
dling around Princes Gardens
naked! The rest of our merry
gang managed to make it
though, and for once we had
subs and balls to warm up
with. It was all looking too
good to be true, but would it
last or would it all fall apart?
We started well with Kemo
and Will looking solid at the
back, when not practising
their diving for future fix-
tures that is. With the mid-
field of Easter and Has doing
‘exactly what it says on the
tin’ and Parrott and Benji
looking dangerous out wide,
the job of the resident mole in
the hole was taken by Hideki,
leaving Pacman up front.
Soon a free kick about 40
yards out on the right hand
side was awarded. All the big
guns/big headed folk went up,
but Easter had other ideas.
After spending an entire
training session taking free
kicks from long range that
week and with a bit of a tail
wind and the low sun in their
keeper’s eyes, he decided to
have a pop... a poor decision
though, and the effort was
fairly comfortably saved.
With a lot of our players out
of position, the quick counter
could have caught us out, but
Easter dealt with the clear-
ance and put the considera-
ble bulk of Greedy away down
the left wing. Greedy put over
a cross, the medic ’keeper got
a touch on it and it fell in the
box. First to react was Hideki,
and a tricky ball was athleti-
cally volleyed in. A very cool
finish and just the start we
were looking for.
We didn’t have to wait
long for the second either. A
Parrott run and shot down
the left had their ’keeper
flapping again, resulting in
another loose ball in the box.
And yes, up popped the mole
for his second, another good
slot and we were flying.
There was very little traffic
going in the other direction
and it was evident that Clifton
was getting seriously bored in
goal. When he was called into
action, the voices in his head
were definitely on song and
the red mist had descended,
but other than adding a little
spice at the back, this was
pretty irrelevant that day.
It didn’t take long for the
third to come. Benji was away
down the right hand side and
finished emphatically for his
first Imperial goal. Keep a
clean sheet now and it’d be a
good points haul for us all in
our fantasy league. But wait,
that bloody pesky mole hadn’t
finished yet and cunningly
took on the keeper, rounding
him with ease to tuck away
his third and our fourth.
Meanwhile, AK had been on
the sidelines making a dra-
matic recovery from his four-
month long injury. He sud-
denly declared himself fully
fit and came on for the man of
the match Hideki.
A great result put us nearly
into the safety of mid-table
mediocrity. ICSM at the time
of writing have a lowly one
point and are lying in the
drop spot. But ULU tables
are never up to date so hope-
fully we will get a repeat of
this fixture next year as it
always makes for an interest-
ing clash.
FOOTBALL
Seconds edge closer to ULU safety
By Ben Anstiss and

Two Head races over a sin-
gle weekend, Saturday
in Reading and Sunday in
Nottingham (BUSA), meant
a busy few days for Imperial
College Boat Club. Reading
was an opportunity for the
‘non-student’ Senior 8+
(made up of graduates and
a few ex-IC rowers), the sec-
ond ‘student’ Senior 8+ and
the Novice men and women
to show what they’re made
of before the massive Head
of the River Races on the
Thames this month.
The Novice girls and the
student Senior 8+ competed
in the morning division. The
girls made a vast improve-
ment on their performance
in Peterborough to come sec-
ond in their division (far, far
better than last!) just behind
the Reading crew. They have
really worked hard these past
weeks to improve dramati-
cally as a crew and should
be commended for the effort
they and their coaches (Foxy
in particular) have all put in.
The non-student Senior 8+
and the Novice men competed
in the afternoon division. The
novice crew decided to boat
extra-early to get a nice long
warm-up paddle before rac-
ing. So early, in fact, that the
senior crew were nowhere to
be seen and their boat was
still on the trailer. As a testa-
ment to IC efficiency, when
the novices de-boated, the
senior guys were all stand-
ing round, their boat on the
trailer; they had managed to
arrive, rig their boat, race and
de-rig in well under an hour.
Therewereexcellentresults
for both boats, with the senior
crew coming 1st in the Senior
1 category, 1st in the divi-
sion and 3rd overall for the
day, just behind Isis (Oxford)
and Leander. Particularly
well done to Rich ‘Hasselhoff’
Harrison who rowed so hard
he threw up 15 strokes from
the finish. The Novices won
their category easily, placing
10th in the division and 18th
overall, 36 seconds behind
the senior boat! Their next
race is the Kingston Head
on 12 March, then the week-
end after it’s the Head of the
River Race on the Thames
from Chiswick to Putney.
Determined to carry
on from the success of the
Reading Head, a small group
of rowers piled into our shiny
new minibus for the long tedi-
ous journey to Nottingham. It
was, in general, a relatively
successful day with IC boats
being placed in the top 3 for
every race they entered.
The men’s coxed four of
Oli, Rich, Iain, Big Ginger
Henry and little Ali won their
event easily. Our top men’s
eight came up against their
old rivals Oxford Brookes
in a bid for the headship.
Unfortunately for them,
Brookes were rather stacked
with GB rowers who’d just
comebackfromtrainingcamp
in Seville. And being Brookes
boys, they spend their entire
lives rowing and pretending
to do ‘degrees’ in tourism or
hotel management.
The women performed well,
despite a major disadvantage.
Whilst all the other crews
paraded their incy-wincy
child-like coxes, they were
stuck with me – rather too tall
and definitely far too heavy to
cox. To top it all off, I’d forgot-
ten my lifejacket and CoxBox
(the magic box that tells me
how fast we’re rowing and
connects my microphone to
the speakers so that the row-
ers can hear me). Oops...
The coxed four came joint
first with Cambridge, even
after a ten second penalty
for use of foul language. The
coxless four brought home
bronze medals, despite hav-
ing never rowed together
before. The eight raced well,
overtaking both Brookes and
Loughborough along the way.
The race officials had repeat-
edly told us that we’d won
the Championship Eights,
but at the medal presenta-
tion we were suddenly told
we’d got silver. They’d made
a typo, apparently, that took
10 seconds off our time. How
convenient that Nottingham
should win (narrowly) on
home ground! Never mind,
we’ll open up a can of whoo-
pass on them at the Women’s
Head, revenge will be sweet!
