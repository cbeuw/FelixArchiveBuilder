YORKIE SUBBUTEO
HEROES
MILKYBAR
Brand: Nestlé
Extras: 2 egg-shaped wobbling toys;
1 bag of Milkybar Buttons
Total weight: 95g
Price: £4.95
“The Milkybar kid is strong and
tough... he’s let his quality control
go a bit now though. Not as tasty as
I remember”
Definitely aimed at younger children, this egg
comes out worst in terms of ‘price per gram’
Official FARCE rating:
★★✩✩✩
Brand: Cadbury
Extras: 1 small bag of Heroes
Total weight: 183g
Price: £1.55
“A generic Cadbury egg and
miniature Heroes. Boring but nice”
The same milk chocolate egg as the Creme
Egg, right? Wrong – according to Felix 1261,
Cadbury’s claim that their eggs are different!
The portion of Heroes was disappointingly
small
Official FARCE rating:
★★★✩✩
SIMPSONS COUCH POTATO
Brand: Kinnerton
Extras: 3 truffle filled milk chocolate bars
Total weight: 165g
Price: £1.55
“A cynical attempt to sell a bad egg
in the name of a good TV show. The
chocolate borders on being edible”
This awful egg was our least favourite, barely
managing a rating of one star. The Coffee
Break team decided that it’s not fit to feed
their dog
Official FARCE rating:
★✩✩✩✩
TOBLERONE
Brand: Kraft
Extras: 3 Toblerone bars
Total weight: 285g
Price: £4.99
“Toblerone is superb. I can see
how Alan Partridge got addicted.
The perfect combination of honey,
almonds and Swiss chocolate”
This went down well. Even at £4.99 there is a
fair bit of chocolate for your money, with three
Toblerone bars included
Official FARCE rating:
★★★★✩
MARS DELIGHT
Brand: Mars
Extras: 2 twin Mars Delight bars
Total weight: 200g
Price: £1.55
“Generic chocolate pumped full of
sugar. Delight? No. Dizzy? Yes”
The latest variation on the theme of the Mars
bar, this wasn’t outstanding but does offer
good value for money
Official FARCE rating:
★★★✩✩
WHITE MALTESERS
Brand: Mars
Extras: 2 bags of White Maltesers
Total weight: 190g
Price: £1.55
“A big egg and two bags of
Maltesers is good value, and the
chocolate isn’t half as vile as the
Milkybar”
This egg caused a near-death experience for
one reviewer last year, but it went down quite
well this time around
Official FARCE rating:
★★★✩✩
KIT KAT JENGA
Brand: Nestlé
Extras: 1 Mini Jenga game;
1 Kit Kat Chunky bar
Total weight: 115g
Price: £4.95
“Not enough chocolate here, but
it’s rescued somewhat by the jenga
game”
The Jenga game was our favourite ‘extra’ this
year. The small blocks were a bit fiddly, but it
provided a good few minutes’ entertainment
Official FARCE rating:
★★★✩✩
Brand: Nestlé
Extras: 1 Yorkie Subbuteo penalty shoot-out
game; 1 Yorkie bar
Total weight: 133g
Price: £4.95
“Penalty shoot-out will entertain
child for 90 seconds, and it will take
a further 90 to eat the miniscule
egg”
The inclusion of a Subbuteo game is certainly
original, but we weren’t too impressed
Official FARCE rating:
★★✩✩✩
