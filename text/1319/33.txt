Well the Riding Club A Team
had an interesting season
this year. We only had three
competitions, as Kingston
had dropped out of the league
before Christmas. We were
competing at our new yard at
Trent for the first time, so the
extra training sessions really
came in handy.
Our first competition of the
season was at Brunel – not
our favourite venue, I have
to say – we always seem to
do badly there and this year
was to prove no exception. I
woke up on the Monday with
an awful cold, and by the time
evening came I found myself
on the phone to captain Jo
having serious doubts that I’d
be able to ride. She convinced
me to come along anyway,
and so I arrived at Snowball
Farm wishing I was in bed!
The rest of the team were
fit and healthy, and Tess was
excited to be at her first ever
BUSA comp. This soon wore
off however, as you realise
that a large part of doing well
in BUSA, as with all aspects
of equestrianism, involves
having luck on your side and
what kind of mood your horse
is in – and it really can go both
ways.
The dressage was a bit of a
shambles really. You need to
be within about 5% of the lead-
ing test to be in with a chance,
and a red-faced Tess (who
spent the whole warm-up
wishing that she was allowed
spurs on her deceptively lazy
horse, who seemed immune
to the whip) got off to a really
good start being less than 3%
behind the leader. Zoë and I
were just about on the case,
both being 5% behind, and Jo
had felt the brunt of BUSA
bad luck, by being the last to
go on her horse, which was
absolutely knackered by this
point, and could barely main-
tain a good canter.
Not surprisingly, we went
into the jumping in last place,
and – let’s face it – the jump-
ing was merely a formality, as
the track was tiny, with the
only ‘problem’ being a tight
turn into the last fence which
was a style. This meant that
it had no real bearing on the
results, and last is where we
stayed. Tess did brilliantly to
pick up fifth in her first comp,
and Zoë beat me to eighth
by one point. The highlight
of the day for me was the
worried manner with which
the other teams enquired
if we still rode at Medburn,
and if we did, would we be
using Winston (anyone who
rides that horse is scarred
for life)!
Next up was UCL. Again,
the dressage was awful. I
thought I’d done really well
on Cashmere, possibly the
idlest pony I’d ever ridden.
He went quite well, and did
a nice test, with a fairly con-
sistent head carriage. I really
didn’t expect to be so far off
the pace – over 10% behind,
though the lead scores were
some of the highest I’ve ever
seen at BUSA. In my defence,
I was still relying heavily on
Nurofen to get me through
the day and I was first on, and
the Judge is usually always
over- or under-generous with
the 1st rider (I claim under!)
Tess rode the huge Bertie
excellently to take the leading
test with him. Jo did a great
job on Frank, and Zoë – who
is more used to taking her
mum’s Thoroughbred event-
ing – is, by her own admis-
sion, not a cob rider, so I’ll say
no more about that! Again,
the jumping had very little
influence on the dressage,
but we got two riders placed
again – Tess joint third and Jo
joint eighth.
And now, the home comp.
Well it was interesting! I had
only ridden my dressage
horse, Malibu, three times, (I
rode my old dressage horse,
the phenomenal Winston, at
least about 100 times) and
Zoë had only ridden Gus for
about 20 minutes (though he
is very similar in character to
Zoë’s favourite horse, Basil).
There were no worries about
Tess and Jo though – they
knew their horses inside
out.
The dressage was the best
yet; we ended on a score of
six, with both Jo and Zoë
absolutely blowing away the
competition on Storm (who
is not an easy ride) and Gus,
who developed brain strain
(though after Zoë got off, as
she was lucky enough to get
him first) when the second
girl bullied him a bit, and he
therefore decided to have a
tantrum in the middle of their
test. There is no consoling
Gus after he’s been upset, his
little thoroughbred brain can’t
handle it, so the third rider
also had a dreadful time! Tess
was ever so disappointed with
her six mark discrepancy.
The Brunel girl had ridden
Merlin before, at a friendly
comp we held for C team rid-
ers last year (what their best
first team riders were doing
there I’ll never know, hardly
fair on the other universities
who did send C team riders),
and knew exactly what but-
tons to press. I had Malibu
first (bad luck of the draw)
and she was like a rocket,
but had calmed down by the
time her subsequent riders
got on. The girl who won on
her made two mistakes that
the judge didn’t seem to pick
up (grrrr), and the less said
about the whole thing the bet-
ter, as far as Tess and I were
concerned!
The jumping was slightly
more eventful than previ-
ous comps, but not much as
Trent had lowered our course
after the previous week’s B
team comp. Trio, Flash, BJ
and Pablo all jumped really
well, though when I warmed
Trio (Tess’ jump horse) up,
he was squealing, bucking
and bronco-ing like a rodeo
pony, and progressively got
faster and faster for the other
teams. Tess did a brilliant
round on him though, espe-
cially since she had him last,
and he really was a like a
steam train by this point. Jo
jumped a brilliant clear on
Flash (with Zoë and I just
having one pole) to secure
first, with Zoë in third, Tess
in fifth and me in seventh.
We got team first place, and
to cap it all off, Jo and Tess
made it through to the region-
als as the two highest scoring
individuals, so big congratula-
tions for them!
If there are any people
reading this who fancy a go
at competing, then please
get in touch, as we are los-
ing four team riders this year
and would love to hear from
anyone who is happy doing
a Novice level dressage test
and jumping a strange (some-
times in the worst sense)
horse around a 3ft course.
