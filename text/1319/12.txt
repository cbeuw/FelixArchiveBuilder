Avid readers of Felix may
have noticed a large number
of reports in the sports pages
involving the little known but
very sexy sport of Ultimate
Frisbee. It is a fact of life
that frisbees are cool, but if
you don’t really fancy run-
ning around after 175g of
aerodynamic plastic, there is
the more sedate alternative
of Frisbee Freestyle.
While they’re not getting
Vietnamese children to sew
clothes together for Tiger
Woods to flaunt himself in,
a certain multinational com-
pany recently decided that
Freestyle was rather stylish.
Since they spent rather a
large amount of money on the
idea, it would seem a shame
not to at least try it. The basic
idea is that you spin the fris-
bee very fast, then toss it
around your body in a variety
of silly ways. Next, toss it to
someone else, who does their
own mean little manoeuvre,
much like a plastic-assisted
breakdancing face-off, but
without the bling and inevi-
table 14-year-old ghetto kid
going “man, that was whack
fo’ shizzle”.
The first thing to do is get
your frisbee and spray the
underneath with silicon spray.
This will make it nice and
slippery and make perform-
ing tricks much easier. Feel
free to make anything else
nice and slippery as you see
fit, and make sure you trim
your nails since they’re going
to be important in a minute.
Hold the frisbee like you’re
about to throw it, but instead
of throwing it a long way,
throw it only a short distance
and with so much spin your
wrist snaps [see picture 1].
Do it a bit less next time
though. When it comes back
down, put your finger under-
neath it and let the frisbee
spin on your nail. This is actu-
ally quite tricky as you have
to move your finger so that
it is under the lowest part of
the frisbee. But once it’s spin-
ning, you can appear both
smooth and sophisticated, as
Steve demonstrates [see pic-
ture 2].
From this position, you can
toss it into the air and catch it
again, bounce it off your knee
or grind it on your teeth. You
can also perform chest rolls
[see picture 3] and back rolls
[see picture 4], although you
may find this easier if you
move your pony tail out of
the way.
Once you’ve mastered all
of the above, you are ready to
further your mystical journey
into the finer aspects of fris-
beetarianism (the belief that
when someone dies, “his soul
gets flung onto a roof, and
just stays there” – George
Carlin). For this, I can high-
ly recommend contacting
juggling@ic.ac.uk and telling
us how clever you are. We’ll
be in the union on Tuesdays
from 6pm onwards, and just
before this article ends, I’d
like to thank the IC Disc
Doctors for the loan of one
of their frisbees, a replica
of which can be seen in the
Union Bar for those of you
with sharp eyes and a taste
for real ale.

Ten things I can do that you can’t
EPISODE SEVEN: Frisbee freestyle
1. Throw the frisbee a very short distance, with a lot of spin; 2. ‘Catch’ it and let it spin on your fingernail;
3. Try a ‘chest roll’ if you’re feeling adventurous; 4. Or even a ‘back roll’

Ladies and gentlemen, three
minutes until curtain. No
two… or is it one? However
long you have to wait until
seeing the latest DramSoc
production, Noises Off by
Michael Frayne, it will be too
long!
Directed by Andre Refig,
this is sure to be an evening
of farcical fun. How could
anyone miss out on a play
that contains female leads
wearing nothing but their
underwear and sardines that
can manage to attack actors
at all the wrong moments?
The play is based on a thea-
tre group’s production Noises
On, but things are not going
well. With Lloyd, the sarcas-
tic and perfectionist director,
clashing with Selsdon, a geri-
atric, alcohol-dependent old
hack, and angry lovers being
chased with fire axes, this
promises to provide enter-
tainment throughout.
It starts with a rehearsal for
Noises On, which frankly isn’t
going well. As the show is on
in only a few hours and some
people have had only a catnap
behind the sofa in the last 48
hours, things are getting a bit
stressful. With missed cues,
doors that can’t open, and
characters being assaulted
with various bunches of flow-
ers, nothing starts smoothly.
This play really captures
the stress and sometimes
extreme panic that settles in
during any production. The
inherent trick in Noises Off is
how the cast have to execute
the same dialogue and com-
plex entrances and moves,
but from the reverse perspec-
tive. This is achieved by turn-
ing the whole set around dur-
ing the second act! No mean
feat... but the show must go
on, even though there’s utter
bedlam backstage and the
matinée is descending into a
complete nightmare!
I have to recommend this
latest offering from our resi-
dent thespians, as it brings
together wit with intellectual
offerings, which many farces
find difficult. Showing Monday
14 March to Thursday 17
March at 7.30pm in the Union
Concert Hall, it’s only £4:50
for students and £6 others.
