19. In issue 1313 we did Small
Stories, where we condensed the
plots of great films into a couple of
lines. Just tell us what film we’re
describing here.
‘There’s this guy, and he goes
to this party to see his missus or
something, but there are some bad
German terrorists there. Then he
kills a bunch of them.’
20. Cat-Phrase - the hastily drew,
poorly thought-out, fun game for
all the family. Our artist is away
this week, so were forced to use the
magic of copy and paste to put this
together. Just say what you see,
what’s pussy doing?
21. The Hoff got a page all to himself
for Dear David, and he hasn’t left
since. Here’s a quick problem, just
tell us who’s it is, and what they’re
actually talking about.
“Dave,
Nobodyunderstandsme.Everyone
keeps telling me what they think is
best, what about me?
Maybe I enjoy taking crack? Maybe
I enjoy doing heroin? Everyone just
wants to spoil my fun!
My girlfriend left me recently and
we ended up arguing in the pub, and
some paparazzi took pictures, so
she’s well pissed now.
I know I’ll find other women Hoff,
so should I carry on with my life, or
should I clean up to win back my
ex?
She’s pretty fit.
Thanks David, loved your work in
Baywatch!”
22. Heroes and Villains was really
just a chance to slag off people we
dislike – the heroes bit came later!
Here’s another villain of ours, just
answer the question about them.
And remember kids, if someone
offers you an Usher, 50 Cent or
Maroon-fucking-5 record, just say
no.
‘Hahahahaha! We’re the delight-
fully EVIL staff of the world-famous
plaza hotel, New York. We terrorised
that little brat Kevin McAllister in
the legendary work of genius, Home
Alone 2: Lost in New York. Kevin
scared us out of his room by using
an inflatable doll, manipulating it so
it looked as though it was singing
in the shower. But what kind of doll
was it?’
A. David Hasselhoff
B. A naked lady
C. A clown
23. More slagging off a couple of
weeks ago, with Eight Things We
Hate About You. This time we were
moaning about Imperial, which
moan-wise is a bit of an open goal,
seeing as though nobody seems to
like the place. Here’s another moan,
but what are we talking about?
‘Some people are just far too keen,
especially this lot. It’s a case of job’s
for the boys with these guys, though
there is the occasional girl there.
They run this College in the most
clique-y way possible, and bombard
us with pointless crap come election
time.’
24. Just last week we did History Of
Hoff, to spice it up a little this time
round we’ve made a slight and sub-
tle change to the format, replacing
David with his arch-rival and nem-
esis, Mr T. Tell us what historical
event Mr and his bling are obscur-
ing to get the points.
Well, good luck! You’ve got until the
beginning of next term!

Hello again, and welcome to the
last puzzle of term. I’ve nothing to
say about it – no theme, no obscure
words, just an ordinary cryptic. So
instead I’ll write something about
extraordinary cryptics, for the bene-
fitofthosewhofindordinaryonestoo
easy but haven’t yet found anything
more taxing. Specifically, I’d like
to mention the Listener crossword,
printed in the Weekend Review sec-
tion of the Saturday Times. Listener
crosswords are thematic, challeng-
ing and rewarding; recent themes
have included a murder mystery in
which solvers had to find the culprit,
Dante’s Inferno, and the construc-
tion of a Valentine’s Day card. If
you’re a hardened solver, I strongly
recommend you give them a shot. If
not, fear not: Felix will provide.
