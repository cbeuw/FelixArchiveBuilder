LIVE REVIEWS
It was my first time at the Spitz
and I was really impressed. It’s a
five minute walk from King’s Cross
station and really easy to find. We
walked through the blistering cold,
past the old Spitalfield market and
into the Spitz. As I entered, a restau-
rant greeted me with warm gusts
of gastronomical delights. I ignored
my urge to steal someone’s plate of
pasta and proceeded up the stairs to
the venue.
The venue is awesome and holds
about 250 people. Its white walls
are separated by oak beams which
reach up to the high ceiling. The
room is surrounded by a cushioned
bench – handy if you’re a lazy git like
me. The stage was lit by purple and
blue spot lights; simple but classy.
When we got there it was start-
ing to fill up and shortly after the
first band came on - the Scottish
band Half Cousin. I was watching
from the ‘wings’ and watched as
they proceeded to carry on half a
radiator, part of a shopping trolley,
an old electronic drum kit (the kind
you can buy from Argos), and an
old blue metal locker. To be honest
I expected at worst some sort of
experimental noise bollocks. What
we got was phenomenal: the lead
singer, clearly an accomplished gui-
tarist, finger picked his way through
some delicate and beautiful riffs. He
made me laugh though; he was so
Scottish Indie he could have joined
Belle & Sebastian and no-one would
have noticed.
His gorgeous voice shut me up
though. I don’t yet know what it
sounds like on record but live it
was ethereal. The rest of the band
kicked in; the drummer looked like
Hagrid from Harry Potter, his huge
unkempt beard shaking as he furi-
ously battered his unconventional
kit. Using the radiator and office
chair leg (set up on a cymbal stand)
as substitute cowbells (a wise deci-
sion as they provided the same high
pitched percussive element but qui-
eter, shorter and sharper), Hagrid
bust out some strange break-beat/
rock-beat hybrids. As he was cymbal
and high-hat shy the beats sounded
sparse and though loud and power-
ful allowed the more graceful guitar
and vocals to shine through. The
bass player was also an integral part
of the band playing heavily distorted
bass lines, but in short bursts again
not suppressing the vocals. At the
same time he used his foot to hit the
pads of the aforementioned elec-
tric drum kit, adding another layer
of percussion. The band was com-
pleted by keyboard player who also
added percussion by drumming on
the big blue locker they brought… I
don’t know why but it sounded mint.
They finished their set with a solo
acoustic song, got up and packed
their gear into the big blue locker.
DIY efficiency at its best.
The night was going well by my
standards, and I tentatively waited
for Hood to come on. I was also
unsure about how exactly they
would put together a live show that
would meet the high standards that
they set on their records. Hood is
an ever-evolving collective. Over
their nine albums of work (of which
I have heard four) their musical
style changes covering many genres
including indie rock, electronica and
hip hop. Indeed their universally
acclaimed Cold House is blessed by
the presence of hip hop experimen-
talists cLOUDDEAD on no less than
three tracks. Their line up reflects
their recording career with a very
long list of temporary members.
Founding members Richard (vocals
and guitars) and Christopher Adams
(bass) are joined by Stephen Royle
on drums as a permanent member,
and aided by Mark Wright.
Opening with You Show No
Emotion At All, they began to show
their proficiency in the live field.
Against a backdrop of projected
autumn sunsets in public parks (I
found this quite nostalgic) they cre-
ated a warm atmosphere of guitars
and keyboards brushed with skitter-
ing beats and white noise, the bass
undulating like the hills in the film
reel. It was compelling to watch, and
more so to listen. However, three
songs in and disaster struck – an
onstage power cut! I’ve never seen
one of those before. So for the next
two songs the PA was a bit sketchy
with a loss of vocals at one point, and
also the drummer’s headphones fal-
tering, knocking him out of time. It
must have been really gutting for
the band and we were certainly dis-
appointed as it really affected their
performance.
Hood persevered like profession-
als and continued to play tortured,
beautiful creations. The system
returned to normal and Hood played
out the rest of their set. Anyone who
knows Hood will tell you that it’s
very hard to successfully describe
their music. The vocals drift like
ghosts in and out of the intricate net-
work of notes and electronic beats,
supplemented by live drums and
keyboards. The resulting sound is
beautiful and melancholy, tragic and
inspiring, heart warming and spine
chilling. I know this appears to be
hyperbole but they were very very
good, and only massive technical
failures held them back from a near
perfect performance. Monkeez
Last Wednesday night I lost my
London-afflicted musical purity
and descended deep into the dun-
geons that is The Play Room, at
Chez Stelios (10 Paddington St
Marylebone, Tube: Baker Street).
My friend suggested that I come and
hang out while he played in the band
for Nicholece K Garner, the star
act that night, supported by 3-piece
Shrugged.
The wave of nostalgia hit me the
moment I entered the room. I’ve
previously been avoiding London’s
local music scene for two reasons
– I thought that for my first year
at least I should hang out with my
classmates and attempt to concen-
trate on my course. Also, I left my
dear music-loving friends back in
hometown Melbourne, and had a
mighty hard time convincing the
classical music geeks in London
that the alternative stuff is cool.
Naïve as I was, I’ve wasted a lot of
valuable time not enjoying London’s
underground music scene.
The Play Room transported me
back to my days in Melbourne,
which is a city littered with invisible
treasures – funky hideaway bars
and jazz clubs that crawl with life
at night. The cozy dark room with
low ceilings, pretty lights and lots
of candles was buzzing with people
that you don’t see on the streets of
London during the daytime hours
– the all-natural part hippie tren-
dies, or “St Kilda crowd” as we
would say at home. The atmosphere
was friendly and relaxed, and nearly
everyone seemed to be mates with
someone on stage.
Nicholece K Garner – also a
Melbourne girl – brought her whole-
some, vibrant style to the heart of
London. With a clear high voice that
was not at all whiney (see: Kasey
Chambers), husky at times but very
bold and direct, Nicholece’s singing
was energetic and captivating. The
group worked very well together as
a whole, the musicians getting on
with what they were doing without
a fuss. The songs had varied themes
of nature, loneliness, ‘naughty’
girls... the usual innocent stuff – my
favourite being The Stop And Go
Man about a relation of Nicholece’s
aspiring to be the man with the stop
and go sign on a country road in
outback Australia.
There were bits of funk, blues and
even reggae in the set, at times
sounding a lot like the John Butler
Trio (especially when singing about
Jabbaluka, a controversial uranium
mine in the Northern Territory). She
whetted our appetite with interest-
ing introductions to each number,
and added to the relaxed nature
of the whole thing with her chirpy,
uninhibited style. Nicholece and
co. were musical and entertaining
– it was fresh, a little different, and
the sort of unoffensive music that
almost anyone would be content to
listen to.
Of course, going to see unsigned
bands can be dangerous business
– it’s venturing into the unknown
where lies the occasional treasure,
but there’s certainly a lot of strange
waters to wade though. Shrugged
wereaninterestingbunch–Ithought
at one point Matchbox 20, at anoth-
er Coldplay, and constantly about
how the singer would benefit from
a lesson or two. Don’t get me wrong
– they could make a pretty good
noise, and the musical ideas were
sound – with some lovely melodi-
cally sensuous chord progressions
to prick up the ear. Unfortunately for
them, the singer was, only a little,
but pretty consistently below pitch,
which may not annoy most people,
but my musical ear betrays me yet
again. Having said that, Jack White
manages to miss four or five pitches
but somehow it’s still OK, so maybe
he’s onto something...
There was certainly a lot of acting
going on on stage – the frontman
swinging from side to side with his
eyes closed was not too unusual, but
the bassist curiously managed to
play the instrument with his elbow
bent (possibly in some strange show
of pained emotion) back so that he
looked rather like a chicken. They
had very lyrical melodic lines, and
ambiguous chord points that were
very attractive. The lyrics were not
very memorable, but all in all, a
decent show.
It was certainly an interesting,
entertaining night out, and I have a
feeling that I got good value for my
money (all four pounds of it). It’s
tempting to indulge in taking a risk
every forthcoming Wednesday – and
going to The Play Room to be enter-
tained. The venue itself is so snug
and comfy – it’s an appealing place
to de-stress midweek whilst enjoy-
ing some new and unusual music,
and it’s a great way to keep in touch
with some of the goings-on in alter-
native music... I’ve finally realised
that it makes you look pretty cool
when you can talk to musicians and
music-lovers about bands no one’s
heard of. Elisse
