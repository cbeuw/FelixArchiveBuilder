to get in touch, it’ll be fun!
This week we’re going to go back
over old ground – the questions here
are all based on things we’ve done in
previous issues. There’s two points
for each corrrect answer, making a
huge 48 points available. It’s enough
to let some of you catch up!
1. Way back in the autumn term,
we did our very first issue. Nobody
entered. Shame really, ‘cos it
was great. The main feature was
Mission: Imperial, where we took a
picture of the Felix tank and you had
to tell us where it was in College.
We’ve since lost the tank so, we’ve
used The Hoff instead. Guess what
we want you to tell us about this pic-
ture? (Clue: tell us where it is)
2. In our second issue we did one
of our favourite quizzes, Whose
Breasts Are These? For some
reason the editor wasn’t too keen
though, something about ‘too much
nipple’. But who’s this?
3. George W Bush Is Dumb, and
depsite our best efforts, he’s still
the boss. Not especially surprising
really. Tell us which of these quotes
isn’t a real Bush-ism.
A. “We’re concerned about AIDS
inside our White House. Make no
mistake about that.”
B. “When we consider the future
of our nation’s libraries... we must
remember the lessons of September
11th.”
C. “I believe that, as quickly as
possible, young cows ought to be
allowed to go across our border.”
4. In Goonies Never Say Die we
asked you to match the Goonies
quote to the character. We don’t
want to repeat ourselves though.
This time, tell us which of these
quotes isn’t from a legendary eight-
ies film (and is from some poncey
bollocks instead).
A. “I’ll tell you why. I think you’re
a lonely person. I drive by this place
a lot and I see you here. I see a lot
of people around you. And I see all
these phones and all this stuff on
your desk. It means nothing.”
B. “Unbelievable, that old Biff
could have chosen that particular
date. It could mean that, that point
in time inherently contains some
sort of cosmic significance... On the
other hand, it could just be an amaz-
ing coincidence.”
C. “And then there was your
boobs we did. Now, your boobs were
Minnie and Mickey, I remember
that because of Disneyworld. And
Felix! Felix is what we called your...
*meow*.”
5. In issue 1305 we asked you wether
a celebrity was Dead or Alive. It’s
the same again this time around.
6. It’s the General Election in a mat-
ter of weeks, and I’m sure we’ll come
up with something really satirical
and witty nearer the time. Until then
we’ll do what we did before, The
Blair Film Project. Tell us what
film Blair has managed to squeeze
his way into.
7. Foot In Mouth was a quote quiz,
where you had to match the bull-
shit said to the celebrity bullshitter.
Here’s a quote, who said it?
“Instead of getting married again,
I’m going to find a woman I don’t like
and just give her a house.”
8.Wetookthepissoutoftheover-paid
prima-donnas of the Premiership
with Ugly XI. Here’s another ming-
ing footballer. Tell us who it is.
9. For International Beats we
translated a song into a foreign lan-
guage and then back again, creating
a hideous shitty version, like a Joss
Stone cover if you like. Tell us the
artist and the title of this song:
“Not more long frightened of the
darkness
Neither the noon darkens any-
thing
Nothing so ridiculously adolescent
and desperate
So childish
In a better slower rhythm
And more calculated
No opportunity of the escape.”
10. When we did Coffee Break
Cryptograms we didn’t think any-
one would like it, seeing as though
we just got it off the web (though
not the first page of Google, we’re
far too cunning for that). Here’s a
cryptogram for you. Tell us what it
means.
11. Baby pictures of famous people
was the idea behind Hollywood’s
Finest. Here’s another baby, tell us
who he/she/it grew up into.
12. At Christmas we did a couple of
things, the big one being our Super-
Mega-Ultimate Xmas Lyrics Quiz,
a true test of festive spirit. What
song is this?
“And it’s been so long
But I will be there
To sing this song
To pass the time away
Driving in my car.”
13. Our other Christmas thing was
Good Year / Bad Year, our very
brief quiz on 2004. Here’s an even
briefer quiz on 2005:
The Huygens probe landed on
Saturn’s moon Titan this year, but
how many moons does Saturn
have?
14. The first issue of the year brought
Double Vision, a chance for us to
fiddle around badly with Photoshop,
a task with which we succeeded
spectacularly. Here’s a mix of two
celebrities, just tell us which two:
15. The Movie Quote Quiz does
exactly what it says it does. However
seeing as though it’s the last issue,
and it’s far too easy to Imdb straight
quotes, we’re gonna mix it up a little.
Like question nine, it’s going into
another language and back again.
“It did not matter. Did not it sig-
nify anything. When I was broken,
I would leave and would steal some
more. We ran all. We settle police
officers. We settle lawyers. We settle
the judges... all was for the to take.
And now it is all over.”
16. Odd Ones Out was a bunch of
random sets, and you just had to
tell us which didn’t belong. Same
thing this time too – which is the odd
one out here, and more importantly,
why?
Here are Bert, Mustafa (looking
rather fetching in his pink shirt),
He-Man and Chuck Norris.
17. Beat The Intro was another
lyrics quiz, however, it’s far too easy
to just Google these things. This
time you have to complete the song,
which has an Imperial theme.
‘Oh RSM...
18. Here’s a Close-Up of an album
cover, you just tell us the artist and
title please.
