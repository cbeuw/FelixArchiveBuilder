SINGLE REVIEWS
The Subways are a hotly tipped trio
from that most rocking of places…
er, Welwyn Garden City. Somehow,
even with their rather suburban
surroundings, they have managed
to craft a fantastically filthy and
raw brand of garage rock. This is
their first single off of their debut
album but don’t let that fool you,
they are seasoned professionals
having already played Glastonbury
as well as the Reading and Leeds
festivals. The single is a ball of musi-
cal energy, played fast and hard it
doesn’t get the chance to outstay
its welcome clocking in at only 2:58.
It’s very reminiscent of The Von
Bondies at their rollicking best and
paints a bright future for this young
band. Dom Wong
After the huge successes of
their two most recent albums, Get
Ready in 2001 and Retro in 2002,
Manchester’s arguably most influ-
ential band return with the first sin-
gle from their eighth studio album
Waiting for the Sirens’ Call. Krafty
is a far cry from the band’s club-
orientated earlier albums, applying
synthesisers and electronic drums
as embellishments rather than foun-
dations. The song has all the ingre-
dients of a great New Order track
– emotive electronica, timeless
vocals, and Peter Hook’s inimitably
gnarly bass. The chorus is anticli-
mactically drab after the potential
you can sense in the build up, the
song in general lacking the dynam-
ics and strength one would expect
from a grand return single. The
band themselves consider this to be
one of their finest ever tracks, but,
while undeniably being a good song,
it feels more of a mid-album filler
track given New Order’s history.

awards ceremony. Felix tried to get into the red carpet area and spent the night outside

LIVE REVIEWS
If you didn’t already know, the 25th
Brit Awards were held two weeks
ago at Earls Court, London. I decid-
ed to try my luck and get some
interviews for both readers of Felix
and listeners of IC Radio.
I turned up outside Earls Court 2
early in the afternoon and found out
that the security at this event was
very tight. I was hoping to get into
the TV/Radio Press Area so I could
talk to the stars as they arrived but
the one thing I needed to achieve
this was a Red Carpet Pass. After
about half an hour of trying to con-
vince the staff that I was meant to
have one, I was escorted off the
premises. Things were not looking
good.
Eventually I managed to sneak
back in and convinced one security
guard to let me into the paparazzi
area, so I could at least see all
the arrivals. Soon afterwards some
members of Stoic arrived and they
joined me.
First to arrive were Franz
Ferdinand – the Scottish band with
the most nominations of the night.
Soon afterwards the Scissor Sisters
arrived, then Lemar and Jamelia
came together. They kept on com-
ing - Keane, Daniel & Natasha
Bedingfield, McFly, Aleesha ex-
Misteeq, Robbie Williams sporting
a newly shaven head, Green Day,
Jordan, Steve Brookstein from X-
Factor, Joss Stone, Simon from
Blue, Minnie Driver, Sharon &
Kelly Osbourne, Will Young, Dannii
Minogue, Rooster, Gwen Stefani….
The list goes on.
Unfortunately from my position
I couldn’t get any interviews but I
nearly talked to Snoop Dogg and
Pharrell who came over. I asked
Pharrell how he was doing and he
just nodded at me, which doesn’t
really work for radio. Anyway, the
stars came and went and we decid-
ed to retire to a pub because it was
freezing outside.
The Scissor Sisters opened the
night with a great performance of
Take Your Mama Out alongside
Jim Henson singing watermel-
ons, barns and giant birds. They
were the big winners of the night
scooping all three awards they
were nominated for – International
Breakthrough Act, International
Group and International Album.
Franz Ferdinand, Keane and
Joss Stone all walked away with
two awards each, Robbie Williams
was presented with the Best Song
From The Past 25 Years by Little
Britain’s Matt Lucas and David
Walliams (who dressed up as ex-
Take That members Gary Barlow
and Howard Donald), while Sir Bob
Geldof received an Outstanding
Contribution To Music award.
The Brits are known for their
great duets – past examples have
included Kylie & Justin Timberlake,
Robbie Williams & Tom Jones –
and this year was no exception.
Daniel and Natasha Bedingfield did
their first ever duet singing Chaka
Khan’s Ain’t Nobody, Lemar and
Jamelia did a very hot perform-
ance of Addicted To Love and there
was a surprise duet on the night
between Robbie Williams and Joss
Stone with Angels.
Undeterred I went back to Earls
Court 2 after the awards, not know-
ing anything about what had hap-
pened at the ceremony, hoping to
catch some of the stars as they
make their way to the aftershow
party which was also held at Earls
Court. Surprisingly the first per-
son to the leave the event was
Jordan. She said the highlight of the
evening was the food but she also
said, “There were good perform-
ances. I liked Daniel Bedingfield
and Natasha they were very good
and Robbie Williams and Joss. Very
good.”
Girls Aloud left not too long after-
wards. Cheryl was a bit disappoint-
ed to lose out to McFly in the Best
Pop Act but Nadine enjoyed the
evening: “It was very very good. The
highlight was Jamelia and Lemar
for me,” whereas Sarah preferred
Snoop Dogg and Pharrell’s per-
formance of Drop It Like It’s Hot,
as did Amy Winehouse: “Snoop and
Pharrell made my fucking night,
actually they made my week.” When
asked how the night went Amy
replied, “My night starts now. They
didn’t even have any Jack Daniels in
there… Me saying that I look really
pissed – I’m not. I’ve been drinking
water because I’d rather stay sober
on a shitty night than drink shitty
alcohol and get depressed.”
I saw other celebs walk by that
I couldn’t coax over to talk to me.
They included Simon from Blue, who
was on the phone and just waved,
and Tom from McFly, who looked
over when I called his name out
and then proceeded to walk straight
into a bollard. Unfortunately Stoic
didn’t capture that on film – they
left shortly afterwards whereas I
persisted and got to talk to a few
more people.
Fame Academy headmaster
Richard Park thought it was “abso-
lutely marvellous, sensational per-
formances. I love Franz Ferdinand
so I thought they were fantastic but
there was any amount of highlights:
Joss Stone singing with Robbie
Williams that was awesome, Green
Day just brilliant. This was one of
the best Brits I’ve ever been to and
I’ve been to them all for twenty
years. The feeling when Geldof sang
I Don’t Like Mondays was also mar-
vellous. Great night.” Fellow reality
TV judge, Nicky Chapman from Pop
Idol “had a great night” and loved
Robbie and Joss’ performance.
I just managed to spot Capital
DJ Foxy leaving not from the red
carpet and rushed over to him, then
spotting he was with fellow present-
er Katy Hill. Foxy was very friendly
“Hello there. It was very good – a
very good show, Chris Evans was
very good, Gwen Stefani was very
good, the Scissor Sisters were a
brilliant opening, don’t you think,
Miss Katy Hill?” and she replied,
“Brilliant opening, absolutely fan-
tastic. You were quite excited with
Bob Geldof.” Foxy thought he was
“fantastic” and the award was “long
overdue.” When asked about the
atmosphere backstage Foxy told
me, “I’ve been doing it 16 years
now so I suppose it was very organ-
ised. But it’s always fun, a good
atmosphere. I managed to do my
show before and do some backstage
stuff and then come out and then I
watched the show. It’ll be the best
TV show they’ve ever done by a
long way – it’s a made for TV award
show.” Katy Hill was disappointed
that Natasha Bedingfield didn’t win
anything - “I think she’s amazing”
- but when asked about the duet
she explained, “I thought the choice
of song was a bit bizarre seeing as
they’re brother and sister – it was a
little bit lovey-dovey and a bit sexy. I
think they could have chosen a bet-
ter song but they’re both amazing
singers,” and Foxy agreed, “They’re
class those two. Joss Stone was also
class. I think it’s interesting because
a lot of people chat, there’s lots of
people you know so it ends up being
quite a chatty night and there’s lots
of booze going so everyone’s getting
hammered and people lose concen-
tration. But when Robbie came on
the room was just - bang - Robbie
Williams is on stage and that was
great. People will talk about Scissor
Sisters, they’ll talk about Green
Day because they were bloody good
they came on they rocked and I
think people will talk about Robbie’s
duet with Joss Stone and their blos-
soming love affair,” at which we all
laughed and I bid them farewell.
My final interview of the night was
Aleesha, member of the recently
split group Misteeq. She said, “It
was fantastic but my feet are killing
me and I’m being an old woman and
going to bed… Scissor Sisters were
the best.”
I stayed outside the venue in the
freezing cold until the aftershow
party finished, two o’clock in the
morning, but I failed to find the
secret exit where most of the stars
were leaving from.
