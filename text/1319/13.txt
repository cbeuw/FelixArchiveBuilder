By Joseph Ward
and Oliver Todd
Stability has long been
a stranger to the Balkans.
Throughout history, the
region has been the battle-
ground of Europe, and this
provides the backdrop for
the advancing poverty, soar-
ing crime and persistent sec-
tarian violence that we see
today.
Since 1989, when Bulgaria
began the transition to
democracy and market econ-
omy, the society has under-
gone significant upheaval.
While enjoying the gains in
terms of human rights and
civil liberties, quality of life
has declined most acutely for
the poorest and most socially
marginalised.
Now bereft of the state
enterprise that once shoul-
dered its burden, the mono-
lithic state institutions of old
are in neglect. The young,
female and ethnic minori-
ties were hardest hit my the
recent economic depression
with unemployment rates ris-
ing to 80-90% in some Roma
gypsy communities. It is
feared by many that Bulgaria
runs the risk of losing the
new generation to a lack of
educational opportunities
and a breakdown of the tradi-
tional social support network
without replacement with the
new.
While laying to waste much
of the original state welfare,
the cultural transision neces-
sitated to provide support for
orphansanddisabledchildren
otherwise has been slow. The
adoption of orphans is a new
phenonemon in Bulgaria,
and in its early stages has
often been exclusive of ethnic
minorities and the physically
disabled.
Imperial College Aid to the
Balkans (ICAB) is a new soci-
ety that will organise volun-
teer placements to Bosnian
and Bulgarian orphanages
and children’s homes start-
ing this summer. Many of the
problems in these institutions
stem from a lack of staff. We
hope students from Imperial
can provide worthwhile sup-
port to the existing carers
and help fill this gap during
their stay.
There is of course a danger
that this charity will become
part of a so called ‘NGO syn-
drome’. It is no exaggeration
to say that often well mean-
ing, but essentially ineffec-
tive, western organisations
do little to help in the coun-
tries they operate in, and in
some cases get in the way
and even exacerbate the
problems they are there to
alleviate. We hope, however,
that ICAB will be able to offer
a valuable resource and will
fill a demand for staff that
plagues these institutions.
Our overall aim is achievable
and coherent: to provide a
memorable summer experi-
ence for some of the most
disadvantaged children in
Europe.
The trips will be in groups
of four and last a minimum
of two weeks. Our sister
organisation OXAB has been
running similar projects for
several years with much
success, and through these
links we have already set up
placements for Imperial this
summer. ICAB is merely the
mediator; it will be the stu-
dent who decides when to
go, where they go and who to
go with. This is an opportu-
nity to do something different
this summer, to learn about
another part of the world, and
help out at some of the most
understaffed institutions in
the two troubled countries.
To find out more about the
Balkans and ICAB, please
come to one of our meetings:
on Thursday 10 March (today)
at Charing Cross Seminar
room B1 (basement of the
Reynolds), or on Tuesday 15
March at South Kensington
Campus, SAFB room 121
opposite lecture theatre 1.

IMPERIAL COLLEGE
AID TO THE BALKANS
For those of you who don’t
know, the students’ union has
a gem of a club housed in the
basement of the Southside
Building, off Exhibition Road.
Yes, it’s a Free Weights
Club focused on general fit-
ness and specific sporting fit-
ness needs. It’s not exactly
free, but it is cheap and it has
a great range of high qual-
ity equipment. The term ‘free
weight’ is used because we
have barbells and dumbbells
which are used while exercis-
ing without the direct control
afforded by the arms or levers
of a machine.
Formed in the late 1980s, the
club has grown significantly
to have around 250 members
each year for the past few
years. In the past five years
around £25,000 of members’
funds has been invested in
upgrading the equipment to a
high standard.
Isn’t free weights just for
bodybuilders and Olympic
weightlifters, I hear you ask?
Of course bodybuilders use
free weights just as they use
machines. However, your free
weights gym is not focused
on being a bodybuilding
club. Certainly, people can
build their body mass in the
gym, but the focus is on gen-
eral fitness and supplement-
ing sports fitness training
through lifting weights. The
aim is improved strength,
power and endurance.
Free weight training is a
preferred means of develop-
ing elements of specific fit-
ness for many sports. For
example, to be considered
for the elite squad of English
rugby, you must be an effec-
tive user of free weights able
to do lifts such as the clean
and the snatch.
The Free Weights Club
enjoys the membership of
sportspeople from a vari-
ety of clubs including bad-
minton, water polo, martial
arts, rowing, rugby and foot-
ball. Importantly it also has
a strong contingent of non-
sports club members, many
of whom are members of
other clubs and societies.
We have around 80 square
metres of floor space, includ-
ing zones for bench press,
squats,freeweightbarbelland
dumbbell exercises as well as
a number of free weight and
fixed weight machines for
specific muscle group work-
outs. Warming up, there is a
bicycle and there are mats for
stretching.
The club has two qualified
instructors but in addition has
recently enlisted the services
of a well-known advocate of
free weights. Linford Christie
has competed and won at the
highest level in his sport. He
won Olympic gold in the 100
metres in Barcelona in 1992 in
addition to world and national
titles. Free weights have been
an integral part of his training
programme for over 25 years.
We asked Linford what he
saw as the benefits of using
free weights. He told us that
“free weights challenges you
to ensure you get your tech-
nique right so you can apply
maximum effort (both physi-
cal and mental) so you can
keep on improving your per-
formance”.
Elaborating, he said:
“When you do free weights
it is important to make sure
you use each muscle group
effectively. For each exercise
you need to know what are
the prime or secondary move-
ment muscles and what are
the stabilising muscles. You
need to know the right way
to push or lower a weight. If
you do this and get your tech-
nique right you can then face
the mental challenge of lifting
the weights according to the
programme you are working
to and aim at improvements”
Anything else? “Yes, when
you are competing or training
for your sport it’s very rare
that your muscles work in iso-
lation. When you use most
machines you are typically
isolating a muscle group or a
few muscle groups. When you
use free weights, all muscle
groups are in use, whether as
prime or secondary movers
or indeed as stabilisers. That
is a key reason why sports
people have a preference for
free weights”.
In respect of machines ver-
sus free weights, Linford com-
mented: “I do use machines
from time to time and you
have some here. They are
without doubt useful and have
their place. However, you just
don’t face the same challenge
with lifts such as the free
weight bench press and free
weight squat”.
Mmm, but isn’t there a dan-
ger you might lift too much
and get injured? “Well no,
that’s where common sense
and experience come into
play. You should lift with good
technique and according to
your capability and not that
of others. For some of these
exercises, like the bench
press, you should have a
spotter or helper present in
case you feel you need some
help. If you are working to a
programme you shouldn’t be
going overboard anyway. By
all means aspire to do what
others have achieved, but
take the necessary steps and
precautions in getting there.”
Do you think you would have
achieved your goals without
using free weights? “No I
don’t. Machines just cannot
do enough for you if you want
to reach the pinnacle of your
sport.”
In which case, are they
just for the elite? “No way.
All of the squad members
(both male and female) I have
trained with over the years
have used free weights and
so did my competition and
their colleagues. I certainly
see the same in other sports.
And of course in the gyms
I have trained in over the
years I have seen lots of non-
sportspeople use free weights
to good effect. I have been
invited many times to give
advice to schoolkids who are
encouraged and keen to use
free weights.”
Why get involved with our
gym? “Well I do know some
of the past and present mem-
bers and I am doing quite a
bit toward helping people in
their endeavours. Although
we have an Olympic bid going
on, I value facilities like this
and am keen to see people
make as much use of them as
possible to help achieve their
goals – whether sporting or
just general fitness. I did not
have a gym like this available
to me when I first got going.
It’s a great asset and I can’t
believe that the students only
pay £25 a year to use it. The
Union has done well by its
members”.
Whether you just want to
improve your fitness or are
seeking to achieve your goal
of sports stardom, your Free
Weights Club will be delighted
to see you. Visit us in the
basement of the Southside
Building or contact our club
secretary for more informa-
tion about joining and using
the facilities.
