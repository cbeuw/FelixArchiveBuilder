It’s grim oop North
Newcastle’s finest and Warp’s latest signing, Maximo Park, chat to Felix
about their accents, pop, and the red book
21
INTERVIEW
OK, Lord Of The Rings mania has
gone too far when they let the hob-
bits form a band. Cheap shot at the
certainly eccentric looking Young
Knives who take to the stage to an
already large crowd. Hailing from
Oxford (shirt and tie: check. Thick
rimmed glasses: check. Boring mon-
ologues between songs: check), they
make a curiously angular new-wave
racket whilst looking like account-
ants being electrocuted. Yelpy,
dischordant and not bad at all.
But the sold-out crowd at London’s
trendy Infinity club in Mayfair aren’t
here to see some socially retarded
midgets, oh no. They’ve come to see
the on-the-up northerners known
as Maximo Park. Having to force
their way to the stage through the
crowd singer Paul announces “We
are Maximo Park from Newcastle-
upon-Tyne” before leaping in the
air in perfect synchronicity to the
music.
And what music! It’s somewhere
between the tunefulness of Franz
Ferdinand, the mad choppiness
of The Futureheads and the pop
sensibilities of Pulp. Hearing the
songs sang in a heavy and melodic
Geordie accent is a relief after so
many bands that hide their accents.
The crowd dances crazily and
ecstatically (Probably helped by
the cheap cheap drinks), and loud
cheers ensue for staples The Coast
Is Always Changing and brilliant
next single Apply Some Pressure.
The band put on a good stage show
as well, with guitar sparring between
lead guitarist Duncan, and bass-
ist Archis. Lukas, the keyboardist,
does a strange foot-stopping karate-
chopping dance whether he’s play-
ing or not, and Paul leaps around,
does mad-eyed stares, and gener-
ally causes the sound-engineers
a headache by flinging his micro-
phone around on a tiny stage, caus-
ing much humming feedback. At
one point he pulls a mysterious little
red book from his suit-jacket (the
band are all immaculately dressed)
and seems to sing his lyrics from it
frantically.
After a not too surprising encore
(you’d have to fight your way
through the crowd to get away, so
they just hung around at the back of
the stage) they stuck around to DJ
until 3am (Interpol, Coctau Twins,
Phil Collins (!), the Batman theme)
and talk to anyone who came their
way (especially if they were ladies, of
which there were plenty). I dragged
Paul backstage for a chat.
I saw you supporting The
Futureheads a while back,
and you both seem very proud
to announce where you’re
from, and don’t try and hide
your accents. This is often
missing from music, why do
you think this is?
It’sstrangethatpeoplecaresomuch,
and that people draw attention to it.
It seems the most straightforward
and honest thing in the world to sing
in my own accent. It’s embarrassing
to put on a fake accent. I wouldn’t
expect you (I am a pansy southern-
er) to put on earthy northern tones
just to fit in. We want to appear to
be honest, there’s a certain kind of
band where you know that the music
has come from a central core of
their person, which is the thing that
makes the music resonate. That’s
what we want to be, I can be happy
that we haven’t tried to fool anybody,
that our music’s pure.
Do you write the lyrics?
Yeah, I write the words. I came into
the band a little after everyone else,
there were a few lyrics there already
like “I’ll do graffiti and you’ll sing to
me in French” and I just changed
the clauses. Duncan and Archis
sang before, and they swapped gui-
tar and bass. That was how Maximo
Park worked, and I’d seen them in
Newcastle a few times.
You’re signed to Warp, which
tends to be an electonica
label, and I find it interest-
ing that they’re your record
company...
So do I, and that’s one of the reason
that we signed to them. We met with
a number of different companies,
and the independent company that
is Warp stood for the same things
we stood for; being creative, being
individual, trying to push things as
far as they can go. They weren’t
saying, “we want you to be an indie
band” or anything, and the term
indie doesn’t really mean anything
to me now. The word independent
does, but that’s not its meaning any
more.
Many small bands get so fed
up of record labels they split
or form their own label...
Well, that’s kind of what we did ini-
tially, set up “Billingham Records”,
named after the town where I was
originally from. We put out 300 cop-
ies of our debut single on red vinyl,
recorded in a house in Newcastle
where we used to rehearse. Duncan
is a trained sound engineer and
he recorded it. We did everything
ourselves, the DIY ethic. That’s how
they (Warp) found out about it, we
put it in Rough Trade (famous inde-
pendent record shop/label), put it in
the right places, and they picked up
on us and decided that they wanted
to sign a band like us.
A lot of bands don’t publicise
themselves very well, but
you have made a really good
start. How does it feel to have
sold out a few gigs already,
and did you feel constricted
by a small stage?
The whole of this tour’s sold out
now, which is amazing. It just steps
up every time, which is really heart-
ening. I personally like playing
larger stages, but I also like the
atmosphere of smaller gigs. There is
something that gets lost with larger
audiences. It’s the law of averages,
people will be there for different
reasons. It’s nice to play in a 200
capacity place with people who are
obsessed with music. That’s why we
write songs, to try and reach people
who wouldn’t normally listen to an
edgy guitar band. That’s why we try
to be as poppy as possible.
People often hate the idea of
being ‘pop’. Why do you think
that is?
Pop to me just means a tradition, a
tradition that you love and you hate.
You want to rally against the stuff
you hate, and the stuff you love does
this. Whether it’s Aretha Franklin
or Smokey Robinson singing these
soulful pop songs, or Liz Fraiser
from the Coctau Twins gushing out
these beautiful choruses. It’s work-
ing within constrictions, but we like
to write pop songs with a verse and
a chorus, but breaking down the
boundary as to what the chorus is
and what the verse is. We just want
to play around with that idea.
Do you think that the recent
injection of intelligence into
a lot of music, such as Franz
Ferdinand or Bloc Party, is
making pop more credible?
I think that’s true. We want to put an
intelligent spin on things because
not do so would be alien to us. I think
people don’t give the masses or the
populous enough credit. So much
is sold to the public that is sub-
standard, and because that’s the
tradition record companies think it’s
not worth worrying about because
“people” are stupid. I believe that
everyone’s got something in them
that means that they can connect
with another person. That’s what we
try to do, we try to connect person
to person via word of mouth, rather
than going “this is a big band, here
is our single, you will like it because
it is advertised well”. We want to
get into peoples faces, but then they
can make their own mind up, and
then hopefully they will be given
a better product. An independent
record company is the same as a
big record company, it’s trying to
sell something, but it’s trying to
sell something that is beneficial and
good rather than something lame.
I hit your message board
and found rubbish questions
like “what’s your favourite
cheese/lollipop?” and “is the
red book a harking back to
love?”
It kind of is! The reason that it first
appeared is a double gesture really.
I didn’t know the words to the songs
that well, I couldn’t remember what
I’d started, and the words to each
verse are different. I wanted it there
so I decided to make it a perform-
ance piece. You might as well use it
as something entertaining. I’m on a
stage and people have paid to see
that, people don’t want you to just
stand there. The music deserves a
bit more. It may be a bit too theatri-
cal for some people, you’ve got to
carve out your own individual way
of dealing with things, and that’s
my way of dealing with forgetful-
ness! I used to have the lyrics inside
the book, and it’s sometimes nice
to reference things. Everyone goes
“this is really good, you’ve got to
hear this”, so why can’t you do the
same with books? Why does “high
culture” have to be divorced from
“pop culture”, I think everything
should be sitting next to each other.
It’s a more expansive way to look at
the world.
Finally, I had trouble in chat-
ting to all of you in the venue
because you were always
surrounded by ladies! Surely
this is a good thing?
The world is a big place, and eve-
ryone’s got a chance! Duncan and
Tom (the drummer) both have girl-
friends, but the rest of are just very
lonely individuals... well I am, that’s
why I’m the singer! There’s no time
on the road for a relationship.
Unless you get a girl in the
band…
Unless…[some careful considera-
tion] I don’t think there’s room,
we’ve already got five people, that’s
quite a large number.

DEMO REVIEWS
With influences as diverse as Sylvia
Plath, White Noize and Mowtown,
the inimitable Freezerburn are a
force to be reckoned with, mean-
ing they can be forgiven for taking
from everyone, and sounding like
no one. Championed by the likes of
Ikara Colt, Miss Black America and
Stu Campbell of JJ72 and Lowgold
fame, the Hampshire trio have made
a tentative foothold on their path to
musical glory, by the means of their
brief yet promising demo.
Title track Candela is the
autumn rainy-day anthem we’ve
all been waiting for. Reminiscent
of early Ash, Loui’s versatile Terry
Abbott-esque vocals wind them-
selves expressively around poetic
lyrics, catchy bridges and crashing
guitars. Finishing off with a crash-
ing crescendo, Freezerburn enter-
tain with a DIY foot-tapping charm
that doesn’t fail to seduce. Into Your
Arms is a feistier, thoroughly ener-
gising effort, with Kat’s wailing being
a textured foil to the lead. Riffing
and noodling in the Brian Molko
school of rock and roll, these are
the tracks JJ72 are wishing they’d
made for that difficult second album
– fingers crossed hope the compe-
tently resourceful Freezerburn get
to make the debut they deserve.

When the tightly-played drum parts
are the highlight of a song, with
pseudo-atmospheric, yet unorigi-
nal guitar parts alongside slightly
lacklustre, haunting vocals that the
nasally-constipated Dave from InMe
would debate trading for; it’s a given
the listener will not have a good
time. Welcome to ‘When Truth Fails’
by Car Crash Horror. Sans inspira-
tion is one thing, but sans passion
is another – the Sex Pistols had only
two chords to express themselves
with, but they presented those two
with verve, vigour and raw energy.
Thankfully, Car Crash Horror aren’t
completely devoid of passion – the
carefully-crafted slowie, Rubbing
Dust, with its mournful lyrics, and
cymbal-bashing poses with com-
petence, and the band meander
onto their perkier final offering,
the intriguingly-titled Friends and
Strangers. It is evident that diver-
sity is not their strong point – as the
concluding track appears to be a
more vigorously strummed version
of the first, with a more interestingly
timed vocals part, and striking cre-
scendo to complete it with. Talent
is not the limiting factor here, more
the lack of creativity – Car Crash
Horror won’t crash and burn if they
take good care of themselves.
