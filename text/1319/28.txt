Sam Raimi’s production of Boogey
Man exploits all of those fears of
the dark that we had as children
– things that go bump in the night,
eerie shadows, shifty shapes and
that sinisterly semi-open closet
door. Boogey Man does a good job of
creating that all-too-familiar sense
of fear most of us harboured as
children, only this time it’s better
because we can take refuge in the
fact that it is being played out on
a screen in front of us rather than
experiencing it directly again.
The film opens with eight-year-
old Tim Jensen trying to sleep in
his room at night. His imagination
runs into overdrive and everything
in his room seems to take on sinister
and ghastly shapes in the moon-
light. After repeatedly opening and
closing his bedside lamp to confirm
there is nothing in the room with
him, his father finally enters and
scolds him for his irrational fears.
In order to prove there is no ‘boogey
man’, Tim’s father makes a show
of searching through the room and
loudly announcing its absence. That
is until Tim points to his slightly ajar
closet door. The father approaches
the closet and is suddenly seized
and pulled inside by something and
then disappears forever. And so
begins Boogey Man.
Now, fifteen years on, Tim (Barry
Watson) is a successful magazine
editor, engaged to his girlfriend and
colleague Jessica (Tory Mussett).
Unable to put the past behind him,
he still harbours a fear of closets
and has not been home since the
incident with his father fifteen years
ago. He receives a phone call at
his girlfriend’s house one weekend
informing him of his mother’s death
(possibly another victim of the boog-
ey man?) and decides he has to con-
front his fears by returning to the
house – the place it all started – and
spending the night there.
The actual idea behind the film
must be commended. Sam Raimi
and Stephen Kay do a good job of
developing the story in such a way
that it keeps you guessing through-
out, at who – or what – the boogey
man actually is. Is it just a figment
of the protagonist’s imagination or
is it really something supernatural?
The film also has some good frights
packed in – things that will make
you jump in your seat and make
your heart beat faster.
However the film lacked a lot,
which is the reason why Boogey
Man failed to make the mark.
Dialogue and character develop-
ment are virtually non-existent –
you end up neither knowing nor car-
ing about Tim’s new girlfriend. Tim
also meets his childhood friend Kate
when he returns home. Although
there are hints of sexual tension
between the two, the relationship
is completely overlooked in order
to make way for sweeping, badly
angled camera shots of the house
– something you already get plenty
of. Add in some completely random
plot ‘asides’ such as a little girl who
knows the truth about the boogey
man and an uncle who gets shrink-
wrapped, and you get a better idea
of just how much of a non-event the
actual plot was.
Plot holes aside, perhaps the big-
gest letdown was the ending. It
just was not scary – simple as that.
Several loose ends were left untied
– the mystery behind Tim’s uncle’s
gruesome death and the point of
those missing children with a grey
hue just weren’t explained.
Overall, the film is suitable for
some gasp-out-loud frights, but
if you want to see a movie that
actually has a plot, stay in your
closet when Boogey Man rolls into
town.

Disturbing and unsettling, but brilliant
Paedophilia is one of our society’s
most taboo subjects. Often sensa-
tionalised in the media, we are told
it is a clear black and white issue,
where paedophiles are quite clearly
evil people.
So it’s very strange to think that
anyone would want to make an entire
film about this controversial issue.
As distasteful as the concept may
be, it’s approached with surprising
sensitivity and taste. The Woodsman
is a courageous and often moving
drama about a convicted paedophile
trying to go straight.
Kevin Bacon stars as Walter
Rossworth, a convicted paedophile
who has just been released from
prison after serving 12 years and
gets a job in a Philadelphia lum-
ber yard. It’s not such a good idea,
though, that his downtown apart-
ment is opposite a primary school.
At the local lumber yard he meets
and begins a strange affair with
Vickie (Kyra Sedgwick). Vickie, who
takes an instant shine to a loner-like
Walter, is ready to confess her worst
sins to him, but he is not inclined to
reciprocate. And, when he finally
does, he immediately shows her the
door since his guilt and embarrass-
ment makes it extremely difficult
for him to stay with someone once
his secret is revealed. Walter seems
kind and repentant, yet can he ever
truly be forgiven or trusted again?
How much sympathy can we
extend to a man who has done the
things Walter has, and who may still
be capable of doing them?
To its credit, The Woodsman does
not try to force too much compas-
sion on us, or to advance any plea on
Walter’s behalf, apart from the rec-
ognition of his humanity. For some
viewers – as for some of Walter’s co-
workers and family members –this
may be too much to ask. But the
movie neither excuses nor exploits
him, and instead regards him with
wary, ambivalent curiosity.
The whole thing hinges on Bacon’s
performance, and his quiet, brood-
ing turn is among the best work
he’s ever done. He’s also backed
by a solid cast with good contri-
butions from both Sedgwick (his
real-life wife) and Benjamin Bratt,
who plays Walter’s understanding
brother-in-law. It is hard to doubt
Bacon, who has already been widely
praised for his bravery in taking on
such an unpalatable role. Walter is
literally being torn apart by his own
self-contempt. Holding on Bacon’s
face in tight close-up, Kassell gazes,
amazed as he acts with every mus-
cle, every pore of his body.
Other great performances include
Mos Def as a local cop making it very
clear that he’s keeping a close eye
on Walter. There is some fantastic
dialogue between Sergeant Lucas
and Walter. Def plays a unique and
especially human police officer who
sees it as his mission to put scum
like Walter back in jail. Lucas can’t
understand why such criminals
are ever released into society. And
prepare to be amazed by Hannah
Pilkes, who plays one of the film’s
potential victims. It’s unsettling and
absolutely mesmerising.
The movie provides no easy
answers, and it has the good sense
to know when to shut up and let the
images tell the story. The way Walter
looks away from adults and at little
girls says things more powerfully
than any dialogue ever could.
The Woodsman is very well direct-
ed for a debut. Kassell’s direction
is visually strong without becoming
a distraction. She directs the film
in an unassuming, stripped-down
style, avoiding any visual or narra-
tive clutter that would pull attention
away from the actors.
Walter’s quest for normality isn’t
easy, and it isn’t linear. In fact, it isn’t
clear if he’ll ever make it. As he tells
Vickie, most paedophiles are never
cured and end up reincarcerated.
The resolution the picture offers
may be more hopeful than believa-
ble, but the filmmakers nonetheless
make an honest attempt to avoid
either prurient sensationalism or
fake redemption.
The subject matter alone will be
enough to keep some audiences from
seeing The Woodsman. However, I
would strongly suggest you go and
see this film, no matter how uncom-
fortable it makes you feel.
