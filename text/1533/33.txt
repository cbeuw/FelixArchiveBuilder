won’t be any washing up to do until
you next need to wash something up.”

We chanced upon one another after I found you rescu-
ing an adorable kitten from the tree by Oriental Canteen.
I think you did Mech Eng? Anyway, you obviously love
animals - so do I! Call me, you know who! XOXO – Biololo-

Saw you using a Nokia Lumia outside the QTR and con-
sidered striking up conversation over our similar phones.
Then I saw that your phone’s screen was shattered beyond
all recognition. Wasn’t that chic, I’m afraid. Get it sorted. –
Nokia Fan
Saw you doing a reflux in the lab. Your obvious skill in the
arts of ﬁltration intrigued me, and I would deﬁnitely like
to learn about your intriguing choice of techniques (and
perhaps your favourite genre of ﬁlm) over a tepid carbon-
ara if you would be so kind to accept. If not, fare thee well!
I shall attempt to widen my knowledge of the process by
myself. – Sighing Chemist
We’ve gone all Love Actually here in the office. That is, I’m bang-
ing my head against the wall, waiting for it to end. Help us
out if you will, organise your own Christmas Lovestruck mira-
cle! Email felix@imperial.ac.uk with your tale of festive joy.
No loan woes
about how Starbucks have those
new Christmas cups, but it turns
out that I do not give a single soli-
tary shilling about coffee conglom-
erates, so I’ll take a step back on
that one. That is, unless Starbucks
would consider sponsorship in re-
turn for vouchers or something.
Come to think of it, I’ll put anoth-
er name out there. Nandos. Black
card. Post one over and we’ll share
the food related wealth around
campus.
Of course, all of this isn’t just be-
cause my student loan’s running
considerably low.
Sorry, just went ahead and
checked. Turns out it is. What are
the chances?
The Coffee Break Team
After something of a Photoshop-
based hiatus last week, the team
formerly known as the team that
previously brought you Coffee
Break return to stake their claim to
these hallowed pages.
So what is there to muse about
these past couple of weeks while
you kick back, relax, and get on the
scene?
Not a lot really.
It seems that this week was over
faster than shares in an Antarcti-
can ice-cream company (under the
assumption that, of course, they
haven’t expanded into markets
that have a need of frozen treats -
yes, it’s tenuous, deal with it).
I guess I could write something
