Farming for the future
Jennifer Mitchell discusseshowclimatechangewillimpactfarming
ecently, I overheard
two students in the Li-
brary Café discussing
the potential eﬀects of
climate change on what
we eat. “Could you imagine? I mean
ﬁsh and bananas, yuk!” They were
referring to a recent news article pro-
posing that climate change will aﬀect
our crop production to the extent that
we will have to start replacing the po-
tato in our diet with bananas. I didn’t
think any more of this conversation
until the next morning when I opened
the paper to the headline “Climate
change threatens coﬀee crops”. Clear-
ly this is not a good week for food.
Forget the displacement of millions of
people, an increase in severe weather
events and the associated loss of life.
Losing 60% of our coﬀee? Now that’s
serious.
Certainly, agriculture was a reoc-
curring theme at the London Climate
Forum, which was hosted on Imperi-
al’s campus last weekend. Agriculture
will not only be severely aﬀected by
climate change but it is also a major
contributor to the warming of our
planet in the ﬁrst place. At least 30%
of global greenhouse gas emissions
come from agriculture; for every one
kcal of food we produce we consume
nine kcals of fossil fuel.
Speaking at the forum Duncan
Williamson, senior policy advisor
for food at the World Wildlife Fund
(WWF), described agriculture as “the
biggest environmental problem on
the planet” and stated that “the global
food system is doing untold damage to
our environment”. It is true that many
farming practices are huge contribu-
tors to the build-up of greenhouse
gasses in the atmosphere. Add to this
the amount of carbon released when
forests are cleared to make room for
farmland and it’s clear that we cannot
sustain our current farming methods,
not without doing untold damage to
the environment anyway.
There is one huge problem that we
have in trying to combat this. By 2050
the world’s population is predicted to
grow to around 9 billion, an increase
of 2 billion people over the next forty
years. Hunger and malnutrition are
still the number one risks to human
health worldwide, posing a greater
threat to human life than AIDS, ma-
laria and tuberculosis combined. In
fact, as I am writing this article there
are at least 925 million undernour-
ished people in the world. We can’t
even seem to feed the world’s popu-
lation as it stands, let alone 2 billion
more.

Whilst a lack of coﬀee may seem
trivial in comparison to world hunger
— and let’s make no bones about it,
it is — the loss of coﬀee production
serves to highlight serious knock-on
eﬀects that climate change is likely
to have on global agriculture. And it’s
more serious than a lack of morning
caﬀeine ﬁx. The export of coﬀee is
crucial to the economies of countries
such as Brazil and Ethiopia. So, the
fact that coﬀee is a highly climate-de-
pendent crop means that an increase
in global temperature of just a few de-
grees could put the livelihood of the
millions of people that grow and pro-
duce it at serious risk.

duce the miles

food systems which are set to change
due to global warming, as pointed out
by Trewin Restorick, the CEO of inde-
pendent environmental charity Glob-
al Action Plan. In a speech discussing
the current state of climate change
and sustainability he proposed that
businesses around the Indian Ocean
are having to adapt to the eﬀect that
climate change is having upon marine
life. As the ocean is warming tuna are
swimming lower down in the ocean
and are consequently more diﬃcult to
catch. Whilst this may be good news
for tuna, it certainly isn’t good news
for a number of global economies.
It’s not all bad though; there are so-
lutions that could help us to feed more
people whilst also doing less harm to
our environment. After all, the objec-
tive of the London Climate Forum was
not to cast gloom and doom but in-
stead challenge us to think about the
ways in which climate change can be
prevented and ultimately overcome.
This is where a talk given by Duncan
Williamson (senior policy advisor for
food at the WWF) and Ed Dowling
(Founder of Sustaination) provided
some valuable insight. In fact, the
good news is that there are too many
possible solutions to write about in
this article. One solution that seems
particularly interesting, especially to
us London-residing students, is the
creation of urban food systems. As Ed
pointed out, “when you’ve got more
than 50% of the world’s population
living in cities it makes a lot of sense
to grow food there as well.” Commu-
nity and rooftop gardens will reduce
the amount of miles that our food
travels and subsequently the amount
of greenhouse gasses produced in its
transport.
Watching what we eat is also going
to be an important factor in reducing
the eﬀects of agriculture on our envi-
ronment. Eating less meat is certainly
a way to consume less fossil fuels
whilst also feeding more of the Earth’s
population. We already produce
enough food to feed roughly 11 billion
people, so considering that the world
is home to around 7 billion people we
should have enough food right? But
the fact is we don’t. Many of the crops
that we grow end up feeding livestock
instead of people. Not only does this
mean that we still have starving peo-
ple in the world, it also considerably
contributes to climate change. Rough-
ly 25 times more energy is required
to produce one calorie of beef than
to produce one calorie of corn. With
roughly 2 billion more people to feed
by 2050, it’s time we started reconsid-
ering our global food system.
So, as much as I jest about the pros-
pect of a life without coﬀee, and I’ll be
honest I’m still reeling from that one,
London Climate Forum was a serious
statement. That our press should need
to threaten us with coﬀee withdrawal
and chips made from bananas to get
us to engage with climate change is
absurd. Fittingly, as I ﬁnish this arti-
cle the newspaper sports a picture of
climate change protesters in St An-
drews. They hold a sign reading “Na-
ture doesn’t do bailouts”. Time to re-
focus on climate change? I think so.
