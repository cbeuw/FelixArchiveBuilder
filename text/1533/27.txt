FRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER
Zombie Apocalypse Now
The Walking Dead marched straight into Jonna Nybäck’s heart
hen I ﬁrst heard
about the TV
show The Walk-
ing Dead from
my friends I
couldn’t understand their immense
excitement about it. On the question
“what is it about?” I got the answer
“the world is taken over by zombies
and a few people are trying to sur-
vive”. Well, that didn’t do it for me.
I mean, it sounds exactly like every
other zombie movie out there. So I
resisted.
But more and more of my friends
gave in and started to watch and they
all turned into these zombie loving fa-
natics. It got to a point where my cu-
riosity couldn’t take it anymore and I
broke down and watched the ﬁrst epi-
sode to see what the huge hype was
about, then the second episode, then
the third...
It’s an easy watch, you don’t have to
bother your brain too much and it’s
always nice to get a break from study-
ing, just follow along the ride. But I do
warn you, it becomes highly addictive
and might interfere with your study
time – especially if you’re like me and
once you’re hooked, can’t stop watch-
ing!
To break it down, Rick, who is a
sheriﬀ’s deputy, gets shot and wakes
up from a coma a few months later.
During his coma a zombie apocalypse
has taken place and Rick ﬁnds himself
as what seems to be a lone survivor.
When he ﬁnds his wife and kid miss-
ing (of course they wouldn’t still be
in the house, the town is deserted!)
he marches on a quest to ﬁnd them.
During this search he meets several
other survivors and it is interesting to
follow the group dynamic and watch
how an apocalypse can aﬀect human
behaviour. One would think people
would look after one another, but the
fear of not knowing who can be trust-
ed, food and ammunition supplies be-
ing limited and with the tiny detail of
ﬂesh eating zombies all over the place,
it turns in to survival of the ﬁttest.
The show, which is developed by
Frank Darabont and premiered on
the cable television channel AMC
in America in 2010, has received
many nominations such as the Writ-
ers Guild of America Award and a
Golden Globe award nomination for
Best Television Series Drama. With
10.9 million viewers tuning in for the
season three premiere it became the
most-watched basic cable drama tel-
ecast in history.
So, yep, my friends were right. But
as I am writing this I understand
why my friends were frustrated with
me as I said “it sounds stupid” when
they were talking about the show. The
whole zombie-splatter theme doesn’t
do it justice, there is so much more to
the show. All I can say is watch it and
you’ll see what I mean. Who knew
I, myself, would turn into a zombie
lover?

There was a time when watching 5 ep-
isodes every week didn’t pose a chal-
lenge for me. In fact, any week when
this did not happen was out of the
norm. I’ve been ﬁnding it a bit diﬃcult
this term, but never fear, I am up to
the challenge and will keep providing
you with my top picks.
This week’s top 5 episodes contain
a blast from the past in the form of
Frasier. I reviewed this show brieﬂy
a few years back and said it featured
one of my all-time favourite TV char-
acters (Niles Crane) but I hadn’t re-
ally watched it in almost a year. How-
ever, as it is my mom’s favourite show
and I was home for the weekend, we
watched a few episodes. One of them
even managed to snag the top spot
this week:
After a night spent comparing his
non-existent love life with Daphne’s,
Frasier decides to play matchmaker
and tries to set her up with KACL’s
new station manager, Tom. In a classic
case of misunderstandings and mis-
communication, it turns out that Tom
is gay and under the impression that
an invitation to Frasier’s for dinner
is, in fact, a date. What follows is 20
minutes of pure comedic excellence,
featuring all of the show’s main char-
acters at their best.
She’s definitely pulling that
slit off better than Angelina

It’s always annoying when
