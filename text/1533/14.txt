[Force Persuade] Play KOTOR
Edward Bals hasagoodfeelingaboutthis....
ll right, I know my force
powers don’t work
through the printed
word. I guess I’ll have
to persuade you in-
stead with the actual reasons why you
should play this game, and if those
don’t work, well; you are strong-willed
indeed.
SWKOTOR (Star Wars – Knights of
The Old Republic, for those in the know)
is an RPG developed by Bioware, the de-
veloper that more recently has given us
Mass Eﬀect and Dragon Age. KOTOR
often appears in lists of the best games
of all time and its inﬂuence can be seen
in many areas of the gaming world. It
manages to keep quests fresh and en-
tertaining, and to supply us with an
assortment of interesting, memorable
characters (HK-47 the homicidal droid
being a particular favourite, providing a
lot of comic relief). However I will just
say this, the game is from 2003 and so
has graphics from that period. Graphics
whores beware, this is probably not the
game for you, but if you want an engag-
ing game and are able to put on your
nostalgia glasses then I thoroughly rec-
ommend it.
The plot of the game is set 4000
years before the rise of the Galactic
Empire and revolves around the re-
turn of the Sith who are (surprise, sur-
prise) out to destroy the Republic and
the Jedi order because... Jedi are weak
and emotionally stunted? OK, so the
game’s overarching story is fairly ge-
neric, but since when is the highlight
of Star Wars the overarching story?
We have come to expect the battle be-
tween the light and dark side, but it is
the smaller stories that are told in KO-
TOR that are the real highlight of the
game, along with a well handled plot
twist near the end.
Many of the quests are beautifully
crafted mini-stories. One of my par-
ticular favourites is a tearful woman
that wants her robot ‘companion’ re-
turned to her, as he has gone missing.
What seems like a generic fetch quest
quickly becomes a memorable gaming
experience. Upon ﬁnding her robot
you ﬁnd out that he ran away because
after the death of her husband, the
woman had made the robot a surro-
gate husband, which he thought was
unhealthy behaviour. Her somewhat
questionable relationship with her
robot chum can be solved in a few
diﬀerent ways. You can tell him to re-
turn, destroy him, telling the woman
he’s dead or destroy him and lure her
out into the grasslands as well. This
humour shows oﬀ the writing talent
at work for the game and makes you
wonder why more games can’t oﬀer a
similar degree of humour and choice.
The game also oﬀers a few diﬀer-
ent worlds to visit, each with diﬀerent
environments, inhabitants, and po-
tential party members. These are trav-
elled between in your ship, the Ebon
Hawk, a forerunner of the Millenium
Falcon. The galaxy map and the ability
to speak to party members on board
were such good, well implemented
ideas that they were reused as main
features of the Normandy, in the Mass
Eﬀect series.
The game also constantly presents
you with moral choices, allowing you
to be a light-side hero or a dark-side
villain. This mechanic has been used
in many games since, such as Infa-
mous and the Mass Eﬀect series and,
because of its binary choices, it has its
failings. Whilst allowing access to dif-
ferent powers and dialogue options it
basically boils down to: do you want
cool lightning powers, or are you a
morally driven person, even in a vide-
ogame? The choices in dialogue are
very plainly good or evil, detracting
from the experience. There is no real
moral grey area explored, as has been
done in the recent Witcher games, you
either choose good or evil, never re-
ally being given a choice between two
evils.
The gameplay itself is a real-time
combat system in which you can
choose a variety of options (such as
throw grenade, lightsaber attack,
lightning etc.) with your commands
then queued and carried out by your
party. Combat can be paused at any
time to issue commands and you can
also switch characters to give them
commands. This allows for a versatile
battle system that can be light touch
or micro-managed to your tastes.
The success of combat options is
governed by your various stats, with
behind the scenes dice rolls deciding
your actual success. This system gives
a sense of progression through the
game, as early in the game, nearly all
of your sword strikes or blaster shots
miss, but later in the game your at-
tacks will do large damage and will
give you a real sense of power.
As to the sound used in the game,
you deﬁnitely get a Star Wars-y feel
from the score which still manages to
remain fresh, the voice actors aren’t
bad either. The majority of the game is
spoken in Galactic Basic, which luck-
ily remains the same as our language
here on Earth. The few lines of Huttese
and others that are used are just a few
lines of recorded dialogue, repeated
to mean diﬀerent things. This may ag-
gravate hard core Star Wars fans, but
thankfully I’m not one of those and so
can happily go on living my life with-
out a care about whether that Hutt
actually asked me to k i l l
that guy or if he
just wanted me to
get him a drink.
So I’ll end as I
started – thank-
fully the time
that you have
taken to read this
article has al-
lowed me to
get close
enough to
use my force
mind powers
on you… at
least the ar-
ticle served
its purpose.

My issue with GAME
GAME (and co.)
(and co.)
Once in a blue moon, I actually buy my
games from a brick and mortar store.
The UK (and the rest of the world, to
be honest) has been losing high street
games retailers, to the digital distri-
bution mammoths (Steam, Amazon,
etc) and their slightly smaller and odd
nephews (see: EA’s Origin). Oﬀering
lower prices than their physical coun-
terparts, these online retailers have
been whittling away at the competi-
tion, causing a drop in sales of physi-
cal media. No longer will you ﬁnd a
standard edition of a game that con-
tains the printed manual of old, and
instead, all the physical goods come
in the over-priced collected/limited/
deluxe/SUCKA editions.
Now I can see why physical shops are
failing. We’ve been spoiled for too long,
by these instant-purchase methods,
where you enter a string of numbers into
your screen, and suddenly the game’s
downloading onto your computer. It’s a
great method that appeals to those most
likely to play PC games i.e. youthful
technophiles. I went into GAME back
in summer 2012 to pre-order Assassin’s
Creed III for my brother. If you pre-or-
dered on July 4th (Independence Day)
you got a bunch of branded collectibles
(ACIII T-Shirt, lanyard, badge-y/em-
blem-y thing (you get the idea)), which
would be a nice addition for a birthday
present, so I thought I’d get the Join or
Die Collector’s Edition for PC (my fam-
ily’s a bunch of PC-lovers).
The PC release of ACIII rolled around
onFridayjustgone.Despitethefactthat
the branch I pre-ordered from (Oxford
Street) had closed, the pre-order had
been moved to Hamleys. Lovely. I really
do enjoy pushing my way through a sea
of whales and their spawn only a month
before Christmas. Strike one.
I turn up in the rain on the Saturday
to ﬁnd that the game has not even been
delivered to the store yet and that they
don’t know when it’ll be in stock. They
only hold copies for 48hrs, so if I’m late
to pick it up, they’ll sell it to the horde –
“Come back on Monday” they say. I get
back and realise that it’d be a good idea
toleavemynumberwiththem.After30
minutes of Googling and 10 minutes of
conversations with automated phone-
bots, I got nowhere and was charged for
the pleasure. Strike two.
I pop in on Monday, as I’ve no lec-
tures till late – they take down my
number and suggest I go and talk to
one of their reps through their web-
chat service (which isn’t available dur-
ing the weekend, FYI). During my chat
with “Charlie”, we covered that I’d done
nothing wrong, but there’s a very good
chance that my pre-order had been sent
to their Camden store instead. In other
words, the game that I had started pay-
ing for, had been moved to another
store without my knowledge and then,
when I didn’t arrive on the other side
of London to pick up the game, they
sold it oﬀ. Charlie didn’t know when
any store would be getting new stock
and as my preorder was conducted in-
store, I couldn’t get it transferred to
an online purchase, forcing me to buy
it online instead. Aaaaaaaaaaaannnd
strike three!
I’m gonna have a nice long complain
to customer services. I think I’ll stick to
theSteamsalesfornow.Alltheparanoia
in the world about not having physical
media can’t stop me from emptying my
wallet into Gaben’s accounts.
Now I can see why their breed is dying
oﬀ. Maybe they’ll follow the path of the
record store. Good riddance.

someone else without your knowledge:
priceless.
Imperial vs.
UCL Round 2

Angry Gamer Angry Geek’s Cousin
Ross Webster Games Editor
This Tuesday, it was Imperial’s turn
to host the Imperial vs. UCL gaming
tournament. The room was packed,
so I was expecting ﬁerce ﬁghting from
both sides. Instead, I was met with
familiar faces at every turn. In fact,
about 80% of the room were Imperial
students, from what I’ve heard.
My spies, have mentioned that
there’s a bunch of deadlines for UCL
students this week and that’s why they
didn’t turn up. Looks like there was a
slight fail over in the communications
department. Expect a rescheduling.
