32 FRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER
It’s the first of December tomorrow, so this is like, OK and that
Luke Baldwin
We wish you a Merry Christmas!
hat part of
Christmas do
you look for-
ward to most?
The music, the
gifts, the cheer...? Where to begin!
Back when I was a lad, I lived in the
far-oﬀ land of Ethiopia. And so it was
that my ﬁrst memorable experiences
of Christmas were set in that amaz-
ing country. Christmas was always a
time of fun and joy, a relaxed and even
magical time of the year which I al-
ways loved.
Christmas in Ethiopia, though, isn’t
quite the same. For starters, they’ve
got the date all wrong; they celebrate
it on January the 6th. Not only did this
lead to a great deal of confusion about
when one could open one’s presents,
but while I was enjoying my Christ-
mas, all my friends were still waiting
for theirs, which wasn’t ideal, but I still
loved the Christmas season.
And the presents, well, the pre-
sents were never great in all honesty.
When the only shop in town is the
local butcher, you aren’t exactly over-
whelmed by gift options. But nev-
ertheless, those presents that I did
receive always brought tremendous
excitement and joy.
Oh, and the music. What’s all this
business of dreaming about a white
Christmas? In Ethiopia the weather
W
was always gorgeous at Christmas
time; a white Christmas was rather a
preposterous idea to my young mind,
and I never for a moment fell for this
silly business of enjoying a freezing
cold winter Christmas.
But that was Christmas to me, and
I cherished it. Never once did I think
that Christmas could get any better.
I returned to the UK aged fourteen,
during summer, which left me think-
ing the weather here wasn’t too bad.
I was wrong. The days grew shorter
and colder, and I began to wallow in
dismay at the loss of Ethiopia, and
refused to embrace this pathetic and
miserable season as the fulﬁlment of
many a besotted artist’s Christmas
songs.
But then came Christmas, and for
the ﬁrst time I began to see what it
was all about! The twinkling lights
strung across dark cobbled streets,
the smell of crushed pine nee-
dles, the rich ﬂavours of
mince pies and the
warmth of mulled
wine. The season
seems capable of
making even the
most miserable
of folk able pro-
duce a friendly
“hello” as you
pass them on
the street.
And let me not forget the snow. That
ﬁrst Christmas, I awoke one morn’ to
the sight of a landscape covered in a
blanket of white.
And suddenly, those countless songs
I’d listened to, and enjoyed singing,
became real. The Christmas I’d heard
about but never really paid any atten-
tion to was suddenly my actual Christ-
mas, and it was better than any I’d had
before; Christmas had improved.
I’d love to invite you to never stop
searching for a happier Christmas,
and if I may oﬀer a way to do so, let me
share with you the foundation of my
Christmas, which has and will always
be by far the most joyful part of it.
On an ordinary night in a small town
some 2000 years ago, a small, wrinkly
baby was born in a little room, sur-
rounded by stinking animals and laid
in a disgustingly unhygienic man-
ger. The lowest and most humili-
ating of births imaginable, a
real birth, a baby who
screamed and cried
like any other; and I
truly believe this baby
was God.
This may not be the
charming nativity
scene that you’ve
heard of before, in
fact, quite the op-
posite, and it sure doesn’t sound like
good news. But it is, and here’s why.
It means that God is not Father
Christmas, a distant ﬁgure watch-
ing your every step to see if you are
naughty or nice, concerned only with
his presents. Everyone loves Santa
one day of the year, but the rest of the
time he’s just a loner. Is that the story
of God?
No. This is a God whose gift is him-
self, his all, his own life. And it’s not
just gifted to those good enough to
merit it, but it’s a free gift to everyone.
This is a God who comes to the world
out of love, his intention to befriend
us, and who comes oﬀering joy.
I asked you at the start what your
favourite part of Christmas was, and
there are so many things to choose
from, but for me the lowly birth of a
baby eclipses them all.
If you would like to keep searching
for an even Merrier Christmas, con-
sider starting here, with Jesus.
The Christian Union carol service
is happening on the 8th of December.
We’d love you all to come along and
get into the Christmas Spirit with us.
Sing some Christmas Carols, enjoy
some mince pies, and if you would
like to ﬁnd out a little more about Je-
sus, about whom so many songs of joy
have been written.
I wish you all a Merry Christmas!

I’d love to in-
vite you to
never stop
searching
for a happier
Christmas

’m sat across the table from
my friend from Gaza; he
only got back a week ago but
somehow home has man-
aged to ﬁnd its way back on
the news. In between bites of SCR
chicken he tells me about his friends
back home. I ask if they’re OK and
he nods. Suddenly he remembers
that one of his friend’s sisters has
died. He tells me that she left behind
a baby, a little girl only 14 months
old – another orphan and another
dead mother. Of course she was Pal-
estinian, nationless and now dead,
her only crime to have been born in
Gaza.
Why would she matter anyway?
She is only one person, one among
more than one hundred and sixty
others. She will become nothing
more than a statistic, a number,
soon to be forgotten and per-
haps contributing to a Wikipedia
page or a news article. Her child
will undoubtedly not forget be-
ing brought up without a mother
– or maybe she will be killed be-
fore the end. I hear they have just
announced a ceaseﬁre, so maybe
there’s hope for her yet.
Our conversation moves to his
nephew, not yet three years old
but already taking it upon himself
to warn the household when he
hears the sound of explosions out-
side. There are no sirens in Gaza,
no warning of the impending de-
struction of a bomb or a missile.
There are no public shelters to ﬂee
to or safe rooms to hide in, just the
cries of children, it seems, warn-
ing their families when they hear
loud noises. The children of Gaza
may yet sleep in peace tonight, a
change from the incessant sound
of drones piercing the night, the
sound of a million lawnmowers
with the occasional bang shaking
them awake.
It’s funny that his family ended
up in Gaza at all, expelled by the
Israelis from a town called Ashdod
in the ethnic cleansing of 1948,
along with seven hundred thou-
sand others from their homes.
His grandparents have never been
back and neither has he: Palestin-
ian refugees aren’t allowed to go
and see the places they once called
home. It’s ironic that Ashdod is
also on the news, the destination
of many of the rockets ﬁred from
Gaza, only a 20 minute drive away,
so close to home yet a world away.
The numbers game in Gaza is
not important, but no doubt the
death toll will be tragic. Need-
less to say that when one of the
world’s most advanced armies in
the form of the Israeli Defence
Forces decides to punish a peo-
ple with no army, no navy and
no air force, what happens is not
war, it is a massacre. That is what
was witnessed four year ago in
2008/2009 and that is what we saw
in the eight days past, a collective
punishment for a population that
dared to resist. It is also ironic that
these operations pop up every few
years conveniently just before Is-
raeli elections, as if the price to
be paid for political success is the
number of Palestinians one can
butcher.
The point at which we resign
ourselves to apathy and think that
one people, in some corner of the
world, are dying just because that
is how things are, is the point at
which we lose our humanity. I
pray for peace in the Middle East
but I realise that there can never
be a lasting peace in the absence
of justice, and the blood of guilt-
less people will continue to be
spilt, so long as politicians play
games with the lives of innocents
in the balance.
