FRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER

Imperial Cinema introduce
the return of the All-Nighter
Soit’scominguptothattime
of year again when merri-
ment and joy fill the air in
anticipation for that magical
winter tradition…Of staying
up all night watching the lat-
est films, after all there’s no
other special occasions com-
ing up this time of year.
What is this magical winter
warmer of an event you ask?
ImperialCinemaprovidessix
filmsback-to-backforyouto
sit back and relax too, while
showing off your skills of in-
somnia that only an Imperial
student can really master.
But hang on a minute you
proclaim, not even an im-
perial student can survive
without stewing themselves
in coffee. Well we’ve got you
covered with tea, coffee and
all you can eat food, think
of it as our Christm.. I mean
Cinema dinner.
If it’s only Daniel Craig or
EmmaWatsonthatgetsyour
motor running, then why
not just come for the one
film, but be honest would
you really say no to both of
them?
So come down to Union
with a friend or two and
huddleupwatchingfilmsto-
gether like penguins during
this chilly season, because
you known penguins would
do it if they had a cinema.
