FRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER

Catina Willows
Pick-up artistry & arseholery
ingle? Virgin? Afraid to
admit this because Felix
told you you should quit
whining about it, so now
you just keep it all bot-
tled up inside and wank while you
cry yourself to sleep at night? Don’t
worry, you’re not alone! Er, sorry,
you are alone, but this is Imperial,
and there’s a lot of other people out
there just like you.
So, what are you going to do about
it? You know you’ve got to get out
there and pick up chicks, but none of
your three A*s were in social skills.
You made some bad first impres-
sions and now all the girls in halls
think you’re the “weird one,” so you
just keep making awkward chit-chat
in the kitchen while even the guys
who play D&D hook up. You turn to
the internet (it’s never let you down
before!), fire up Chrome in incognito
mode and, fingers shaking, type in
“seduction techniques.”
Welcome to the world of the pick-
up artist, or PUA. These commu-
nities of self-styled experts – part
salesman, part con artist, part sex
offender – teach AFCs (that’s “aver-
age frustrated chumps” – guys like
you) secrets of the “game.” Their
techniques, they say, will teach you
to be a pro womaniser in no time,
and some of them are even giving
out the advice for free! Like any good
Imperial scientist/engineer (delete
as appropriate) you’re sceptical, but
these guys’ FRs (field reports) talk
about them getting #-closes and f-
closes all the time (that’s, er “num-
ber close” and “fuck close”); there’s
got to be some truth to it, right?
These methods are pretty much just
lessons in being an annoying twat,
because we all know girls just love to
date assholes. Let’s have a look!
“WTF, PUA, HB#, LMR, OFWG-
KTA” – the PUA world is filled with
acronyms. Women aren’t “women,”
they’re HBs (hot babes) rated from
1 to 10. AFOG is the alpha female
of group, like Regina George (watch
Mean Girls if that’s lost on you: seri-
ously) and if one of these has a rela-
tionship with a guy who doesn’t need
S
These

experts - part
salesman,
part con
artist, part
sex offender
Men of Imperial – some compulsory reading from Catina Willows
“this one weird old tip to get laid!”
he’s a BBF – beta boyfriend. Most
sickeningly, there’s LMR. That’s “last
minute resistance” from a girl, for
which there’s countless guides to
overcoming, or “forcing” your way
through. There’s another word for
that. Here’s a clue: it begins with R
and Felix commenters won’t shut up
about it.
The neg. Oh, the infamous neg.
This is where you give a girl back-
handed compliments to lower her
self-esteem to the point where she’ll
sleep with even a guy like you. Oh,
wait, apparently it “brings the wom-
an (especially very attractive wom-
en, who are used to getting com-
pliments) down a notch and shows
that the PUA is not overawed by her
beauty. Second, it creates a bit of a
challenge, so, if the woman is at all
interested, she will start chasing the
PUA and trying to win his approval.”
Yeah, I’m sure the ladies will be hot
on your tails after you ask them if
their shoes are from Primark. The
usual response to this is known as
the “fuck off, jerk!”
Peacocking – this is the art of
wearing a daring and unusual piece
of clothing to make you stand out.
There’s some truth to this, but what
PUA guides fail to tell you is that it
really hinges on having a sense of
style. PUA guru “Mystery,” with his
eyeliner and fluffy top hat, looks
like a rejected extra from an Adam
Ant video. Funny? Kinda. Sexy? Let’s
just say that James Bond hasn’t worn
a hat since 1973 for a reason. Your
“classy” fedora you’ve bought to go
with your cargo shorts and Trivium
t-shirt isn’t fooling anyone.
A great blogger once said on the
topic of friendzoning that “women
aren’t machines that you put kind-
ness coins into until you get sex.”
Women aren’t machines that can be
reprogrammed to give you sex for
free, either. Bear that in mind next
time you go “sarging” and trying out
your “game” stammering out aw-
ful pick-up lines in Metric. Tell you
what, try one on me and if it’s pa-
thetic enough, I might just buy you
a drink out of pity. Oh, you’re neg-
ging me? Why yes, actually, my top
is second-hand, just like everything
that comes out of your mouth.
Yeah, so some people can bully
and coerce women into giving out
their numbers, but that’s no way
to form a meaningful relationship.
The sooner you realise that there’s
no magic trick that’s going to get
you into a girl’s pants, the sooner
you might start talking naturally
to people – you might even get
into a girl’s pants. Ciao!
