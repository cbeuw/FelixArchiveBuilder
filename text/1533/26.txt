Britain’s New Breed
Mo Mirza hits the Spector show to find the future of guitar pop
The night was kicked oﬀ by LULS who
did a great job at gathering everyone
around the stage. Firing on all cylinders,
they sang “Swing Low” – a dark, de-
mented pop melody that echoed across
the walls of the venue. A short but sweet
set which left me aching to hearing
more from this tight young band.
They were followed by Splashh who
summoned the spirits of 90s grunge
whilst keeping up their lazybones ap-
pearance with “Vacation”
. ‘Gritty and
low-ﬁ’ is how one could describe them.
They did not disappoint.
This was then followed by Birming-
ham’s own Swim Deep. The songs
were well recognized by the crowd, as
exempliﬁed by the premature mutter-
ings of approval as the band started
playing their acclaimed single – “King
City”
. Swim Deep seem to have a decent
arsenal of catchy tunes that work their
way through. “Honey”
, in my opinion,
is a recent and yummy addition to this
stockpile.
After a long wait, Spector made their
appearance; all but the lead singer...
Where was Macpherson?
Hewas being anobnoxiousscoundrel,
of course; and we all loved him for it.
As the rest of the band launched into
the ﬁrst song, “Twenty Nothing”
, the
crowd squirmed in anticipation until
Macpherson ﬁnally strutted on to the
stage in his blinding white suit with all
the combined arrogance and charm he
could muster - “I lost track of time, re-
mind me how it started…”
The band moved on to awesome ren-
ditions of “Lay Low,” and “Friday Night”
.
“What You Wanted” was another shim-
mering standout with the crowd sing-
ing along with the handsomely voiced
vocalist.
You have to hand it to Macpherson
for being such a fantastic entertainer; he
engaged the crowd with his usual tricks
as he continuously frolicked about the
stage, and the one time he did stop to
catch a breather, he handed the micro-
phone to an audience member…
All of this was then proceeded with
an absolutely lip-smacking version of
their well-known “Celestine” to which
the venue erupted. Another thumping
hit was “Chevy Thunder”
, and we didn’t
have to wait long for Spector to ﬁnish us
oﬀ with one ﬁnal thrust – “Never Fade
Away”
.
Spector were a spectacle; a glowing
example of MacPherson’s dedication
to succeed. His annoying yet captivat-
ing personality enthralled the sold out
crowdatShepard’sBush.Theyupturned
the entire contents of their album Enjoy
It While It Lasts and the crowd abso-
lutely loved the old-school style indie
gems they were treated to.
Towards the end of the set, MacPher-
son took the time show his gratitude to
the fans. “This is what sold-out looks
like,” he smiled as he whipped out his
camera and took a shot of the packed
venue. Even after not having followed
the tour, you could tell that the band
had all the vibes of a triumphant war-
rior at the end of an epic battle. Taking
into account the successful tour they’ve
had, one wonders where Macpherson
will lead Spector next.
A short and sweet interview with dream-pop band, Swim Deep during
which Austin desperately shuffled around the room for a bag of Lemsip.
Where does the name Swim Deep come from?
