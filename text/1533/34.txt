She was awesome Cleggman. She
was a warrior, Cleggman…and a
princess.

And she was hot
Cameron_DA_Maneron!!!
And she was hot. Is your wife a hot
warrior princess Cleggman? No. And
neither is mine. Xena is all we ever
had.
Cleggmanxxx
I’m not denying any of these things,
it just has nothing to do with the
Leveson Enquiry.

Cameron_DA_Maneron!!!
Ffs Cleggman why couldn’t you just
agree with my Leveson Enquiry
response?
Cleggmanxxx
You didn’t make a response. You just
said ‘Bring back Xena’
Cameron_DA_Maneron!!!
Yeah. Xena the Warrior Princess.
What happened to her?
Cleggmanxxx
Wtf does Xena the Warrior Prin-
cess have to do with the Leveson
Enquiry?
The Hangman Guide to:
Ruining a dinner party
How to turn Come Dine With Me into “please
leave this second and we are no longer friends”
Robbie Williams walks
out of house in a COAT
Robbie could be pregnant, or so
his friend says, as he’s spotted
romping around in a coat that he
reportedly “bought in a shop one
day” because he was a “bit cold”.
FAIL TODAY
Ahhh dinner parties. To all the fresh-
ers: they’ll become a thing next year.
To everyone in other years: if you’re
thinking “hey, I don’t get invited to
any dinner parties” then the answer is
“everyone hates you and thinks you’re
a tool”. Congrats!
Here’s a however-many-I-can-be-
bothered-to-write point guide to ru-
inging a perfectly nice night.
“I’m not sure about the
whole hair thing, it’s a bit
difficult”
Hair malfunction for incredibly
minor royal (she doesn’t know it yet)
Tess Daly has barely noticeable hair
change, our forensic scientist finds.
We were chillin’, then we had sex
In the kitchen, in the shower
In my bed, on the couch
In other words: we had sex
All over the house
All over the house
All over the house
Insightful and thought provoking
Skepta. One point though. If that is
indeed “all over the house” then you
have a pretty fucking small house. I
thought you were a rap star with loads
of money, as you usually boast about
your cash. Apparently, you don’t have
a second bedroom, or a dinner table,
or an office. Recession hurts. What the
fuck was this: some sort of bungalow.
Not very hood.
Rap Lyric of the Week
Skepta: “All Over The House”
Put your feet on the tables,
bare foot.
Slap out a membership form and ex-
plain how it’s the “way forward” for
the world. For added dramatic feel,
wear a bedsheet under your clothes
and unbutton your shirt like a super-
hero to reveal it. Grab a fake gun and
hold it to the hosts head screaming
“SIGN THE FORM”. When your host
has ﬁnished crying, shout “just a bit of
banter”.
If you’re the host, serve it up as des-
sert on a tray, saying: “I think you’ll
ﬁnd the last course... intriguing”. Then
wait. Major awks.
Don’t wash your feet for a few weeks
building up to the night. Have loads of
calluses and blisters. If possible, have
bunions and scratch your feet over
someone’s soup. Urinate in the coffee before
it’s served
In front of everyone is just the boring
and, to be frank, cliché way to do it.
Sneak into the kitchen and do it. Say
you made the coﬀee better with your
special addition. Explain how you
learnt about this recipe on your gap
year (see next point). Wait until every-
one drinks some and then reveal what
it is. Say you also drizzled it on every-
one’s chocolate cake. Call everyone a
giant bunch of squeamish and uncul-
tured idiots when they get annoyed at
this. Storm out.
Standard twattery advice for all sce-
narios really. Refer to every single
tribe and culture you encountered.
Tell the whole table how you have a
new outlook on life and how it’s made
you see everything diﬀerently. Inform
them how you were “astounded at na-
ture”.
Have incredibly bad table
manners
Elbows on the table, slurping soup,
you know the drill. Also, call the host
a twat and punch them in the face.
That’s generally a faux pas.
What’s the
relevance of this
you ask like an idiot.
It’s Dave Lamb, the
sarcastic guy that
narrates the show
Dominate conversation: talk
exclusively about how you
“found yourself” in your gap
year.
Break out a membership
form to the Ku Klux Klan
and order everyone to fill it
out.
