t’s Saturday. You want to go
to a nice restaurant to enjoy a
proper meal (for once!) with
your friends. You are dream-
ing of a huge three course
meal, a delicious starter, a great main
dish and a luxurious dessert accom-
panied with good wine of course but
then you suddenly realise that you
can’t aﬀord it!
Well, I have good news for you.
Even if you think that your cooking
skills are nonexistent you can make
a fantastic three course meal in just 2
hours, at minimum cost and trust me
it will make your friends think that
you are a secret chef! So, invite your
friends and follow my three extreme-
ly simple recipes that will make your
dinner party a huge success. Who
knows? You might get people asking
to come and live with you after this.
(Happened to me, just saying....)
Starter:
Aubergine and honey
heaven
Words cannot explain my excitement
when I ﬁrst made this. I was inspired
by a salad dish I saw on a cooking
show and I thought I should modify
it a bit and give it a try. With no ex-
aggeration this is the best starter you
can ever have since it is light and it
has unique ﬂavours that are married
so well together.
Ingredients:
(Per portion)
1 big aubergine

and dine with you….
I
1 thick slice white bread
5 cherry tomatoes
1 tsp honey
2 tbsp olive oil
4 tbsp tahini dressing
Salt and pepper to taste
Procedure:
Preheat your oven to 180°C. With
a fork, pierce the aubergine several
times and place it in the oven as is
(don’t cut it) for about 40 minutes
or until it is very soft. Then, remove
the skin from the aubergine and cut
it in half lengthwise. Place the bread
in the oven for a few minutes un-
til it gets a very light brown colour
and then place the tomatoes on top
of the bread and return to the oven
for about 10 minutes. In the mean-
time, combine the crushed garlic,
salt, pepper, olive oil and honey and
set aside. When the bread is ready
place the aubergines on top and driz-
zle with the honey dressing and then
with the tahini dressing. Starter is
ready!
Tip: For the starter you will need
about 50 minutes. Be smart and bake
the aubergine in advance since this
will save you a lot of time!
Main:
Penne with homemade
basil pesto
Now, who doesn’t like pasta? This
dish is a guaranteed success. Do not
get scared by the homemade pesto.
It’s super easy! I promise.
Ingredients:
(Per portion)
3⁄4 cup penne or spaghetti
1⁄2 cup fresh basil
100 grams cherry tomatoes
1⁄4 cup olive oil
1⁄2 clove garlic
Salt and pepper to taste
Procedure:
To make the pesto, simply place the
basil, oil, garlic, and salt and pep-
per in the blender and pulse until
smooth. If you don’t have a blender
then chop the basil and garlic very
ﬁnely and then place them in a bowl
and mix with the olive oil, salt and
pepper. Set the pesto aside and move
on to the pasta! In a pot, boil 1 litre
of water, add the pasta and some salt.
After 7 minutes (need to be exact!)
remove the pasta and wash them
with cold water so that they will not
stick together. In a non-stick pan put
the pesto and the whole cherry toma-
toes and when it starts to get warm
add the pasta. Stir and let cook un-
til the tomatoes become soft. Serve
in a pasta bowl and add some fresh
chopped basil on top!
Dessert:
Rich chocolate brownies
Chocolate for dessert. It might sound
typical but these brownies give this
meal a luxurious end. You have to try
them to understand!
Ingredients:
1 cup ﬂour
1 cup sugar
1⁄2 tsp salt
1⁄2 cup cocoa powder
1⁄4 cup chocolate chips
1 tsp soda
1 mashed banana
1⁄4 cup roasted walnuts 1⁄4 cup oil
3⁄4 cup milk
2 tsp white wine vinegar Procedure:
Lightly grease a 9-inch pan (or small-
er if you prefer them taller). Preheat
your oven to 180°C. In a bowl mix
all the dry ingredients including the
chocolate chips and in a separate
bowl combine the wet ingredients
including the banana. Then, combine
the wet with the dry ingredients and
put the mixture in the pan. Bake un-
til you insert a toothpick in the cen-
tre and comes out almost dry. If you
want to make them look more spe-
cial, mix 1⁄2 cup icing sugar with 1
tsp of water and drizzle on top.
So, this Saturday, take maximum
2 hours from your time to make this
great three course meal and easily
impress your friends or that special
someone!
