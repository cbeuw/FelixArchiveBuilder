n Friday 16th
November, Haringey
Magistrates Court
was the inconspicuous
location for the trial of
David Lawley-Wakelin. Mr Lawley-
Wakelin memorably interrupted Tony
Blair with cries of “This man should
be arrested for war crimes” while
the former Prime Minster was giving
evidence at the Leveson enquiry.
Following the combined eﬀorts of
two policemen he was arrested under
Section 5 of the Public Order Act.
On the morning of the hearing,
approximately 30 stop the war
protestors along with members of
the press, gathered outside the court
to support Mr Lawley-Wakelin
and once again protest the ongoing
repercussions of the Iraq war. There
was a cynical suggestion that such a
small court was selected to decrease
the platform for publicity. To further
compound this, the case was initially
to be heard in a court with space for
6 members of the public. After some
gentle persuasion (and the mild threat
of a sit-in) the case was moved to a
larger court.
Throughout the proceedings the
prosecutor called two witnesses
Superintendent Sean Walters and PC
Mark Seckham whilst Mr Wakelin
himself was the only witness for the
defence. In summary, on 28th May
2012 Mr Wakelin planned to protest
Mr Blair’s alleged war crimes on a
public platform during the Leveson
enquiry. Having failed to enter by the
front door, he used the back entrance
reserved for Judge Leveson and court
staﬀ. The corridor leading up to this
door was not guarded and the door
was unlocked. He then walked in and
loudly stated “Excuse me, this man
should be arrested for war crimes” as
well as claiming that Tony Blair was
personally proﬁting ﬁnancially from
the war. PC Mark Seckham and then SI
Sean Walters struggled to restrain Mr
Wakelin. Once they had removed him
from the room, he soon calmed down
and told oﬃcers “I have done what I
came here to do and I will not be any
more trouble”. Following transfer to
Belgravia Police Station, Mr Wakelin
was detained until 2.35pm (by which
time Mr Blair had stepped down from
the witness stand) and his ﬁle was
marked ‘Not for Action’. This was later
overturned and he was summoned to
Haringey Magistrates court.
Mr Wakelin was charged under
Section 5 of the Public Order Act; the
relevant sections are as follows:
1) A person is guilty of an oﬀence if
he-
a) Uses threatening, abusive or
insulting words or behaviour, or
disorderly behaviour
3) It is a defence for the accused to
prove-
a) That he had no reason to believe
that there was any person within
hearing or sight who was likely to be
caused harassment, alarm or distress,
or
c) That his conduct was reasonable
This must be balanced with article
10 of the European Convention on
Human Rights which grants everyone
the freedom of expression subject
to restrictions as ascribed by law.
This negotiation led to some comical
debate about whether people at the
enquiry looked shocked/alarmed/
surprised/amused on the video clip
of the main event as well as whether
being described as a ‘war criminal’
would cause alarm or distress.
After three hours of deliberation, the
judge decided Mr Wakelin’s behaviour
had been disordered and was likely to
have caused alarm or distress. Given
his unemployment (and a previous
caution for throwing urine at police
oﬃcers in 2003), he was ﬁned £100
and asked to pay contributions of £250
and a surcharge of £15 at a rate of £20
per week. Following the judgement,
Mr Lawley-Wakelin gave a small
speech to the few members of the
press who were present and read out
an email of support from Reverend
Desmond Tutu himself.
As well as providing some
amusing asides, this case provided
another opportunity to examine
the accusations against Tony Blair.
Over the last decade, Blair has been
dogged by allegations of misleading
the country into an illegal war
alongside George Bush. This is further
compounded by the unstable situation
in Iraq today which is now home to the
largest US embassy in the world and
many more armed private contractors
than there ever were soldiers.
The case is another in a growing
trend of high proﬁle individual
protests such as Jonathan May-
Bowles’ pie attack on Rupert Murdoch
at a Commons committee hearing and
even more controversially, Trenton
Oldﬁeld’s interruption of the annual
Oxford-Cambridge boat race.
The timing was particularly relevant
for Stop the War Coalition who
hosted a conference the following
day entitled ‘Media and War –
Challenging the consensus’ (at
Goldsmiths – obviously). Throughout
the day, journalists and activists
ran discussions on the failings (and
successes) of reporting on the ongoing
wars in Afghanistan and Iraq – with
Lord Ashdown quoted that morning
as saying “The only rational policy
now is to leave quickly, in good order
and in the company of our allies. This
is the only cause for which further
lives should be risked’. Given the
escalation in violence recently, the
standard of reporting of the Palestine
Israel conﬂict was also discussed.
One journalist for the ﬁnancial times
highlighted their own headline that
day as an example of reporting bias
(“Gaza rocket ﬁred at Jerusalem”).
The ﬁrst discussion of the day was
entitled ‘Serving the military or the
public? Covering the war on terror’.
One of the panellists, Michelle
Stanistreet, General Secretary of the
National Union of Journalists, put
forward suggestions for independent
regulation of the media in order to
prevent monopolies and ensure a high
quality of press. In 2007, she led the
NUJ chapel when the Daily Star tried
to print ‘The Daily Fatwa’ – their crass
impression of what the esteemed
paper would look like if the UK were an
Islamic state. The hierarchal structure
of large media companies render
journalists powerless to challenge the
established position of large papers,
for example until 2002 it has been
reported that the Guardian had a
policy that ‘protests are not news’; this
was publicly revoked following the 2
million strong protest to the Iraq war.
The conference aimed to provide
concrete suggestions for moving
forwarded; these ranged from
simply having discussions with those
around you, to writing for traditional
media outlets as well as ‘alternative’
media sources, contacting MPs and
continuing the protests on the streets.
This advice was put into action this
weekend at the jointly organised
protest in support of Gaza. Amongst
others, Stop the War coalition, the
Palestinian Solidarity Campaign
and the British Muslim Initiative
came together with an estimated
10,000 supporters to march from
Downing Street to the Israeli embassy
in support of Gaza and to protest
the siege and blockade by Israel.
The atmosphere was charged and
emotive with speeches by Tony Benn,
Lindsey German, Jeremy Corbyn
MP, Andy Slaughter MP as well as
Manuel Hassassian, the Palestinian
ambassador. The success of the event
was hardly reﬂected in the main
stream media but the spirit was
deﬁant and hopeful that there will be a
brighter future for Palestine.
