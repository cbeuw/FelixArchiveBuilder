2012 - The end of the world?
You all know how it works. Draw a single closed line by joining
the dots so that the numbered squares are surrounded by the
corresponding number of lines.
Fill the cells with a continuous line that enters and exits
at the shown points, does not pass through a cell twice
and passes through all white boxes. The numbers show
you how many times the “snake” turns in a given row
or column.
After the insanity disease subsided, the Island of Knights and Knaves saw an unprece-
dented rise in tourism. As tourists are, of course, neither knights nor knaves, they can tell
the truth or lie indiscriminately. The Mayor (who is a knight, and therefore a truth-teller)
once told me the following story:
“I was walking along the beach when I happened across two fellows. Now, I knew their
types(Knight,Knave,orTourist),butIdidn’tknowwhowaswhichtype.AsIwalkedpast
them, they talked amongst themselves: “At least one of us is a tourist”, said one, and “At
least one of us is a knight”, said the other. Now, can you tell me their types?”
“Holdon”,Isaid.“Ican’t.Ifyoutellmewhetheryoucouldfigureoutwhowaswho,could
I determine their types?” He replied, and I knew what types the two fellows were.
What types were they? What was the Mayor’s reply?
Did the Mayor figure out who was which type?
The simplest possible question you can ask that elicits a negative answer is “Are you an insane
knight or a sane knave?” (i.e. “Are you a liar?”). To prove you are a sane knave, you can declare “I
am an insane knight”. A sane knight and an insane knave would not say this, as it would be false,
whereas a insane knight would not as it would be true.
Knights and Knaves
Solution to last week’s Knights and Knaves puzzle:
More nonogam goodness; the
numbers show you the length
of the groups of black squares as
well as how many of them there
are in a row or column.

Connect all the islands
with bridges so that you
can get from any island
to any other one. There
are restrictions, though:
the bridges have to be
either vertical or hori-
zonal and they must not
intersect. You can have
up to two bridges be-
tween any two islands
and, last but not least,
each island must have
exactly as many bridges
as the number on it
states.
