FRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER
lying is terrifying: trust
me, I’ve tried it. And
don’t bother trying to
contradict me, because
how could sitting in a
metal can 30,000 feet up in the air
not be scary?
Don’t get me wrong though. I’m a
Physicist and a firm believer in both
Bernoulli’s Principle and Newton’s
Second Law (indeed I have no objec-
tion to any of Newton’s laws). I know
that the plane should stay in the air.
And I’m reliably informed that I’m
more likely to meet my end in Lap-
land, ravaged by kangaroos, than be
involved in even the most minor of
aviation incidents. This doesn’t reas-
sure me, but instead just increases
my wariness around those unusual
marsupials.
Flying is scary because you have
absolutely no control over what is
going on. If and when something
bad happens, the chances of escap-
ing alive are slim. In addition, you
can do nothing to maximise your
chances of survival – you’re all in
the same boat, so to speak. Surely all
humans feel this helplessness when
they fasten their seatbelt, ready for
take off?
So why is it that I find myself in the
minority ‘fear-of-flying’ camp? Why
am I the only one who cowers under
their blanket during take off? Why
doesn’t everyone else, like me, try to
find the airline with the best safety
record, as opposed to the one easiest
on the pocket? And why on earth do
some people claim to enjoy flying? I
mean, supposing they’ve conquered
the whole scary bit with the plane in
the sky, surely they can’t find zero
leg-room, a barely audible film and
dubious food pleasurable? “Perhaps
they’re business class people?” I hear
F
Stephanie Walton shares her travel woes – and makes some
worrying predictions for the future
you say. No way – they’re the ones
who always look the least happy on
the flight. When you catch your two
seconds’ glimpse of them sipping
their champagne, they’re never smil-
ing. Indeed, if any of these economy
class people who claim to enjoy fly-
ing actually genuinely do, I’m going
to find them and ask them to judge
my thesis – they must be extremely
easy to please.
I expect that in the early twentieth
century when commercial aviation
was just taking off (no pun intended)
people would have given flying a bit
more thought. Flanders and Swann
certainly understood where I was
coming from, exemplified in their
witty piece “By Air”: “If God had
intended us to fly, He would never
have given us the railways.” But the
truly frightening thing is that, whilst
Flanders had to get his head around
flying, we’re going to have to em-
brace rocket travel. Indeed, some
already are. Sarah Brightman, the
singer, is heading off to the Interna-
tional Space Station in 2015. And the
entrepreneur Elon Musk wants to go
to Mars. He co-founded PayPal, so

he’s surely capable of making it hap-
pen. Space tourism will soon be all
too real and, as with flying, you’ll be
missing out on lots of adventures if
you don’t hop on board.
So, next time you fly, fasten your
seatbelt, put your rug over your
head, sit back (though not too far,
your seat-back must remain firmly
in the upright position) and (try to)
relax. And if it all seems too awful,
then count your lucky stars that you
don’t (yet) have to endure space sick-
ness and bone loss just to become
well-travelled.
Fear of flying: just common sense!

Letters
Sir,
We are writing this letter in response to
an article published in the Comment
section on 23/11/12, entitled ‘Virgins:
quit whining!’. The attitude toward
women in this article is exempliﬁed in
this quote: “Getting back on the title,
guys are concerned about the “lack of
females” (which directly eﬀects their sex
life), while mostly girls are complain-
ing about sexism. Dudes! Wake up!
For the “lack of females” issue, when a
hunter ﬁnds no rabbits, he just hunts
elsewhere, or he even settles with ducks,
not being sure whether the rabbit or the
duck is mostly appreciated.
”
Comparing women to game dehuman-
ises them by treating them like animals
incapable of higher thought. Not only
that, it plays into a harmful narrative
in which they are sport or sustenance for
men rather than people with their own
lives and aspirations. Turning some peo-
ple into targets lets others get away with
sexual harassment and assault even in
‘enlightened’ societies in the West – in our
own country, 25% of respondents to the
NUS’ Hidden Marks survey revealed that
they had been sexually assaulted.
Felix prides itself on being the ‘student
voice’ at Imperial. In that case, what
does it say about us, the students, when
sexist articles make it into press? We un-
derstand the importance of giving peo-
ple a chance to have their voice heard,
but when an article implicitly supports
the predation of women it crosses a line
that shouldn’t be crossed.
IC Feminist Society Committee
Comment Editors’ reply:
As Comment editors, we are obliged
to print whatever contributions we
receive, including the frankly bizarre
article to which you refer below.
As you rightly stated, any piece which
supports the predation of women cross-
es a line which should not be crossed.
We are sure that this was not the inten-
tion of the author, although we do real-
ise that the quote which you reference
may be conducive to the formation of
that opinion when taken out of context.
Had we considered the contents of the
published article to be out of keeping
with appropriate standards, we would
not have allowed it to be printed - and
indeed, some parts of the original piece
were removed for this reason. How-
ever, we absolutely cannot censure a
writer completely just because we do
not necessarily endorse their opinions,
notwithstanding their rather inelegant
mode of expression. This principle is
embodied in Felix’s motto, which is
“keep the cat free”.
Furthermore, we are convinced that
the contents of the article will not be
taken as representative of the views of
the student body, but merely as those
of the writer in question. Everyone has
a right to reply whether in article or
letter form, and we are very grateful
for the fact that you have done so.
Kind regards,
Felix Comment Editors
