and were the winners of the ‘Wat-
erAid’ prize. They produced an inno-
vative data visualization solution for
WaterAid, which is a charity aiming to
provide safe, clean water to the world’s
poorest people.
Mike Smith and Joe Downie from
WaterAid commented saying: “The
J.P. Morgan team created a fantastic
opportunity to engage and challenge
top university students for some really
worthwhile causes – it was great being
a part of it!”
The other Imperial team, called ‘Re-
curret’ included Julian Sutherland, Al-
exandru Paunoiu, Razvan Marinescu,
Shahin Mir and Niklas Hambuechen.
They ﬁnished in the top 6 and created
a sophisticated and highly engaging
awareness raising solution for The Na-
ture Conservancy, which is a charity
that develops ecological-preservation
solutions around the world.
Andrew Courtney from The Nature
Conservancy said: “Overall the week-
end exceeded my expectations: the
students were top-notch and came
up with several creative solutions;
the event itself was well designed and
gave the students and charities plenty
of opportunities to interact. The en-
tire event was a great opportunity for
TNC to work with highly talented stu-
dents and rapidly prototype numer-
ous solutions to an ongoing challenge
we’ve faced. “
Sandeep Saksena, Chief Invest-
ment Oﬃcer of EMEA Markets Tech
Strategies, stated that “J.P. Morgan
has prided itself in being one of the
top technology ﬁrms out there, and
bringing together top students from
our universities, directed by the so-
cial responsibilities that we as a ﬁrm
strongly believe in.”

Clubs with Wordpress sites need
to upgrade or be hacked... intense
Tim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief
Imperial clubs with old Wordpress
sites are vulnerable to attack from
hackers.
A number of the Clubs and Socie-
ties at Imperial College Union have
been running outdated versions of
Wordpress, which leaves them open to
attack. The problem is easily ﬁxed by
simply keeping installations up to date
when asked to update (those annoying
“UPDATE NOW OR ELSE” boxes).
The actual number of clubs that have
been attacked seems to be small. The
Union Sys Admin, Philip Kent, said
that they are “making sure everyone
updates so it doesn’t happen again.” He
added that all old Wordpress sites were
not necessarily attacked. He added that
Wordpress is not the “only expoitable
pieve of software” saying that “other
software has security holes too, but we
are targeting Wordpress on the basis
that it is widely used on club websites,
and it has a poorer track record for be-
ing secure [than other software]”.
At the moment, it would appear that
the content of the websites were al-
tered but no sensitive information was
compromised.
The problem will be minimised by
immediately turning oﬀ a Wordpress
that is found to be outdated. It is only
re-instated when it has been declared
clean and the club has upgraded the
software. Since starting the weekly no-
tiﬁcations a large number of clubs have
already upgraded their installations
and Kent says the Union are “well on
our way to fully resolving this prob-
lem”.
Kent said that they have “switched
every site (except those which use cus-
tom domains) over to use SSL for all
access; which, while this will not stop
these kinds of attacks, it will prevent
some of the results of what is done
to people’s websites. For example, on
one website, the attackers modiﬁed
the templates so that it displays what
is called an iframe (embedding a web-
site inside a website). Because we now
run under SSL, unless the website in-
side the iframe is also running under
SSL, web browsers will often complain
or refuse to show the contents of the
frame, which may prevent showing of
undesirable content. The same is true
if they try to load external images or
JavaScript.”
They are also working on a way to
make upgrading easier, but are yet to
complete it. There is a guide on the
SysAdmin website (http://union.ic.ac.
uk/sysadmin), which describes how to
upgrade
