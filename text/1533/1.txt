A new government e-petition has re-
cently been launched in opposition to
the perceived growing eﬀect that an
animal rights activist campaign has
had on the transport sector. The pe-
tition urges the government to pro-
tect the transportation of laboratory
animals to halt the loss of vital medical
research. This is a response to the in-
creased refusal by haulage companies
to import the animals from overseas
due to increased lobbying by the activ-
ists’ campaign.
The activists, in disagreement to the
testing of animals, allegedly began a
campaign of targeting hauliers with
complaints via online social media and
through letter writing. The accusa-
tory nature of the campaign chastises
the transport companies for being in-
volved in the trade.
The lobbying has had large eﬀect on
the industry, with the campaign suc-
ceeding in stopping the companies,
one-by-one, from taking part in the
practice. British Airways stopped im-
porting laboratory animals early on.
This was followed by large ferry opera-
tors P&O, SeaFrance, DFDS Seaways.
It was revealed that earlier this year
the last major ferry operator, Stena, has
also pulled out of the trade. This has
closed oﬀ all sea routes for the impor-
tation of the animals.

Imperial team “IC
Crowd” in the top 3
83 technology students from 15 dif-
ferent Universities participated in
J.P Morgan’s ﬁrst ever Tech Coding
Challenge. 17 teams competed in this
Hackathon-style event that took place
in the headquarters of J.P. Morgan
in Canary Wharf. Their coding skills
were put to the test as they used tech-
nology to choose and solve a social
challenge presented by three leading
charities: Centrepoint, WaterAid or
The Nature Conservancy.
The 2-day event was staged in part-
nership with J.P. Morgan’s Technology
for Social Good team that are based in
New York. The teams worked for over
30 hours to create solutions to real-life
challenged faced by the charities. The
teams then presented their solutions
to the judging panel and a winning
team was selected for each charity and
an overall winning team was also cho-
sen. The winning teams were given iP-
ads, Amazon vouchers and the oppor-
tunity to continue working with their
chosen charity and with J.P. Morgan’s
‘Tech for Social Good’ team to turn
their solution into a reality.
Two teams from Imperial reached
the ﬁnal of the competition. One
team, called the ‘IC Crowd’, had the
following Imperial students: Pamela
Cruz, Francesco Di Mauro, Michal
Sipko, Michal Srb and Giulio Mecoc-
ci. They ﬁnished in the top three >>4
