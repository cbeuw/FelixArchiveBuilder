used to use browser based
music services “Groove-
shark” & “Hypem” in addi-
tion to downloading to fulﬁl
my musical listening needs.
However, I knew it wasn’t really sus-
tainable, especially considering that
Grooveshark is in a very long legal
battle and is currently being sued by
several labels, the biggest case for
$17.1 billion from Universal. Com-
bine this with Android, Apple and
Facebook all removing the Groove-
shark app from their OS/Social net-
work and the future isn’t bright for
Grooveshark, or my musical fulﬁl-
ment.
As a result, three months ago,
I ﬁnally gave in and signed up to a
Spotify premium account. In those
three months though, I’ve got to ad-
mit, I didn’t actually look back (un-
til yesterday at least). Spotify has
grown incredibly since its initial in-
vitation only launch in 2008 and its
oﬃcial UK open-to-all launch two
years later in Feburary 2010. The
online streaming music giant, origi-
nally from Sweden and now based
in London, has most recently been
beta testing a web browser version
to further extent it’s already wide
reach, that already includes excellent
integration within Windows, Mac
OS, Linux, Facebook, Android, iOS,
Blackberry, Symbian, webOS, Sonos
and even Windows Phone (clearly
the most important for any growing
company). The company has been
slowly trying to gather a monopoly
in the market and appears to be do-
ing quite well, with Goldman Sachs
valuating the company at $3billion
this month.
Why not stay with Spotify?
Two weeks ago, on 13th November,
Google released Google Music, LG
manufactured Nexus 4 and the Nex-
us 10, in the UK, all through Google
Play. It was largely successful day for
Google as they sold out of the Nexus 4
online in under 15 minutes in the UK
and later sold out stateside in under an
hour (although they were selling the
devices at a heavily subsidised price
for launch).
Across the pond, US citizens have
been lucky enough to have Google
Music since November 16th 2011.
But Google’s latest iteration of Google
Music brought with it some pretty
shiny and hefty new guns to help it
take on Spotify, Amazon, Microsoft’s
Xbox Music, Sony’s Music Unlimited
and Apple’s iTunes.
The Pros
Admittedly, I’m two weeks late trying
out Google Music, due to the fact I’m
a ﬁnal year student at Imperial and
job hunting (Microsoft, IBM, Google,
etc, if you’re reading, I’ll be grateful
for a fast-track to assessment centre).
Despite my slightly late adoption for a
Technology Editor, I’ve still had time
to test some of Google’s incredible of-
ferings.
The ﬁrst being the new download-
able “Google Play Music Manager”.
This may just be a small upload client
that helps organise your music. But it
allows all users to upload and store on
the Google Cloud up to 20,000 songs
imported from their own music li-
brary in 320kpbs quality. Then it’s ac-
cessible anywhere in the world, at any
time, on any laptop or anything run-
ning Android (at the moment). The
beauty of the service, and basically of
everything the Mountain View giant
does, is that this service is 100% free.
So, as of right now I have 6,324 songs
that are currently being uploaded to
the Google cloud.

The second main feature is its “Scan
& Match” technology that matches
your tracks with those already on
Google Music to ensure all track in-
formation is correct (in future users
won’t have to actually upload tracks).
In addition to matching the track in-
formation, this feature will upgrade
your music to 320kpbs quality (if ap-
plicable), and again, all for free! This
versus the similar services of Ama-
zon and Apple, who charge over £20
for the service, but only upgrade to
256kpbs, Google’s a clear winner.
Google has even catered for those
annoying moments for when you
might lost connection for short peri-
ods of time (for example on the tube),
by caching your recent and queued
songs just in case you lose signal. In
addition, for oﬄine play, all Google
Music songs in your library are avail-
able for download to your PC, phone
and/or tablet, again all for free.
With regards to cost, Google Music
is undercutting Apple iTunes by 20p
per individual song (79p vs Apple’s
99p per song) and £2-3 per album.
There is also some neat Google+
integration with a free “share a track”
option which helps out the very im-
pressive but depressingly quiet social
network by allowing a free play of
songs to friends.
Finally, Google is oﬀering a good
easy to use browser based interface,
but of course, this is really all subjec-
tive and in some people’s opinions
could be a con.
All in all, the Pro’s send us a strong
message that Google Music has been
well worth the year long wait!
The Cons
By far the biggest con at the moment
is that the mobile application is only
currently on Android, excluding the
huge market of Apple iPhone users,
the signiﬁcantly smaller market of
those of us on Windows Phone as well
as those people unfortunate enough to
still be on the ancient Blackberry OS.
Another con is that the service is
browser based with no desktop appli-
cation other than the very basic, but
functional, “Google Play Music Man-
ger”. For some people this’ll prove to
be a pretty signiﬁcant disadvantage,
but in this Editor’s opinion, it’s al-
most a non-issue and very minor con.
I think Spotify are making a very big
step in the right direction by devel-
oping their browser based software
and think the biggest selling point of
Grooveshark (other than the ridicu-
lously large music catalogue of songs
and remixes) was that it was browser
based and therefore more easily acces-
sible anywhere in the world on pretty
much any computer.
Finally, Google are coming under
ﬁre from the UK’s record industry
trade association, the British Phono-
graphic Industry (BPI), who aren’t ex-
actly happy with Google on the whole.
They’re Chief Executive, Geoﬀ Tay-
lor, complains that “we don’t think it
makes any sense for them to be doing
something which does support artists
and then, on the other hand, under-
mine artists by referring consumers
to illegal sites”. The basis of the com-
plaint has actually nothing to do with
Google Music and is actually based on
Google Search, as when you “Google”
a song you are provided with links
to both legal and illegal sources. The
BPI actually went so far to get several
iconic musicians, including $265 mil-
lion rich Elton John, to write directly
to PM David Cameron publically to
winge about Google. A Google Play
representative responded to the accu-
sations claiming “I think [the service]
is something that is hopefully going to
make piracy obsolete because it’s so
easy to operate within the bounds of
the law that there is really no need to
go beyond them.” Make your mind up
as you like, but in this Editor’s opin-
ion (I hate reading that line in arti-
cles too), the BPI’s argument is very
weak as it’s based solely on the fact
that Google won’t be their bitch and
censor the lengthy list of websites the
BPI want them to ban from internet
search results.
Conclusion
Overall, despite the cons, my mind
is pretty made up on Google Music
being well worth the wait. But, until
Mountain View release a Windows
Phone app, I’m afraid I’ll still be paying
for my Spotify premium account and
make occasional use of Google Music
as an excellent library storage facility.
It is still hard, however, to pick an
overall winner for music lovers as
everybody has diﬀerent preferences.
The best result will perhaps be a com-
bination of two or more services, so
I recommend trying out and trialling
as many free services as you can. You
can try Google Music at music.google.
com and follow the online tour to dis-
cover more.
One thing is for sure though, if Ap-
ple want to remain at the forefront in
the future of digital music, it’s going
to need to radically innovate its 2001
based iTunes business model. The
younger and more agile Spotify and
Google have come and innovated the
market, will Apple be able to follow.
Google comes into a pretty competitive market against these badass’ of digital music, who all have their names in their logos, except iTunes - Apple always has to be different doesn’t it.
