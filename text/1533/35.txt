This week you’re strug-
gling to get over the split of
WU LYF. Unfortunately you
don’t get much sympathy
from your friends because
no one likes them and
you’re just being a whingey
hipster about it. Saddened,
you go home and watch
.gifs of their videos on Tum-
blr.
This week you’re in the library
looking for Janeway’s The
Cell because you ill advis-
edly ruined your own copy by
revising in the bath, you for-
got that it weighs about 400
pounds and dropped it in the
water. You realise that you’re
doing a Mech Eng degree
anyway, and go home and re
think your life.
This week you set fire to the
rain, and watch it burn as you
touch my face. This air pol-
lution is a serious problem, I
mean it’s burning really rath-
er furiously. Oh Christ now
the clouds are on fire, oh lord
stop touching my face I think
we should find cover. This is
the worst Civ Eng field trip
ever.
This week you see from the
other end of the corridor
that your PhD supervisor is
walking your way. You jump
out of the nearest window
in an attempt to avoid con-
versation. Looking back as
you plummet to your death,
you see the look of relief
and joy on your supervisors
face.
This week you’re somehow
still manager of Chelsea,
unfortunately your reputa-
tion has now sunk to the
point that you start get-
ting booed even when you
walk into lectures. You ask
Fernando Torres for help
on your problem sheet, but
it turns out he’s useless at
physics too. Twat.
This week you attend Union
Council. It’s so long and dull
you’re forced to eat your left
leg out of a mixture of bore-
dom and hunger. As you
hop away dejectedly, you
take solace in the fact that
students throughout Impe-
rial will be thankful for your
sacrifice for student welfare
LOL JK.
This week you see a hot girl
in the library. Unfortunately
you are just a text book so
you have no way of commu-
nicating your attraction to her.
Wait! She’s coming this way!
You put on your cool face
and try not to look excited.
Devastatingly she takes the
book next to you down from
the shelf.
This week you are preparing
for a date but realise you’ve
run out of hair gel. You decide
to improvise by using your
cum instead. When it dries
your hair looks all crusty and
you can’t wash it out. You start
wearing a hat to cover it up but
after two days it starts to really
smell; a second date is defi-
nitely off the cards.
This week you go ice skat-
ing at the natural history
museum, unfortunately your
senior tutor is right infront of
you, also ice skating. It’s go-
ing okay until in a bizarre ac-
cident his trousers fall down,
you slip on the ice and one of
those irritatingly fast skating
children cuts between the
two of you.
This week you go to a house
party and actually manage to
pull. However, when you get
home, your companion spends
half an hour evacuating their
bowels in your toilet. They then
fall asleep in your bed before
anything exciting can happen.
Ohwell,atleastyoucanboastto
all your friends that you brought
someone home last night.
This week you climb a statue
and take all your clothes off.
You start humping the statue,
and oh god, the feel of cool
bronze on your genitals feels
good! But then the dodgy
blue study pills wears off
and you realise that you are
surrounded by police. Good
luck explaining that one to
your future employers!
This week you have to choose
between eating a pube toastie
for lunch every day for the rest of
your life or having a 5 foot green
tail. On the one hand the pube
toastie would be disgusting, but
it would definitely be more dis-
crete and you could always add
cheese. On the other hand at
least the tail would be a talking
point. What’s it going to be?
