In? Or better off out?
A
s we move towards Im-
perial’scentenaryyear,
our College is ready to
take a step forward to
become a University
in its own right when it leaves the
University of London. But for our
students’ union, this move will be
a step back when we leave the Uni-
versity of London Union.
For the first time in over 50 years,
we will be on our own, isolated
and mute without a national voice.
As we gear up for a referendum on NUS membership, Alex Guite makes the case in
favour of joining and warns against the potential consequences of opting out
When our own Rector proposed
top up-fees in 2002, it triggered a
national campaign. With the real
threat of top-up fees rising and
more national upheaval in higher
education within three years, this is
not the time to be cut off.
From the discounts membership
would give us as students to the
greater say it gives our Union, it is
time to look again at our member-
ship of the National Union of Stu-
dents (NUS).
I still remember the my disap-
pointment and that of my friends
when we started university here
and discovered that we couldn’t
get an NUS card, almost a symbol
of student life itself. But more than
that, and the part which hurt our
wallets, we couldn’t get money off at
Amazon, Topman, Pizza Hut or an-
ywhere else that NUS has negotiat-
ed discounts for its members. From
this year, the NUS card comes with
a free ICIS card, extending even
further the scope of discounts that
are available to those in the NUS.
It was NUS lobbying which se-
cured council tax exemption for
students, the biggest student dis-
count of all time. Could Imperial,
or any university, have negotiated
this on its own? Therein lies the
real benefit of the NUS: that it is
the recognised voice of students.
F
oralotofyou(infact,Idon’t
think I’d be wrong in say-
ing most of you), welcome
to England. A well done
to all of the freshers that
are gracing us with their presence
this year as you’ve worked damned
hard. Not only have you been pres-
sured by your parents from an early
age to do well in school, but when
you got to GCSE level you were told
to work your arses off, you got the
grades you wanted and sailed into
your A-Levels, or IB, or Certificate
of Competency, or whatever eve-
rybody else does where you come
from. You toiled and broke your
back with work for two years before
finally landing the grades to make it
into this prestigious institution that
we call Imperial College London (or
soon to be Imperial University, per-
haps; frankly, nobody really knows).
Congratulations.
If the above paragraph doesn’t fit
you, which it almost certainly won’t,
then you will be one of either two
types of people who we regularly
see here – genius academics, who
are the laziest people on the plan-
et and will inevitably show up to a
grand total of three lectures in their
first year and somehow end up with
a high first, or “just another Ox-
bridge reject”. Have no fear though.
I can see straight through you – the
truth is that you’ll fit right in here
and chances to slack off will be
aplenty despite the nasty rumours
about high workloads. Unless you
want to get a first. Then it’s a com-
pletely different story.
You will be given the royal treat-
ment here at Gimperial as our in-
stitution strives to be amongst the
elite of the elite. The number of fe-
male students on campus is so low
that even the most rowdy male will
be forced to sit at a desk and learn
something once in a while. Addi-
tionally, when you are considering
straying from your hard-working
habits in halls and begin listening
to music or, heaven forbid, playing
World of Warcraft, rest assured that
the alarms fitted in each room in
the halls of residences also react to
fun, and when the fun levels in any
hall get past a certain point, they
are sure to blare and usher you all
out onto the pavement for half an
hour while your annoyed wardens
run around trying to figure out who
used a chip pan to set three and a
half kitchens on fire.
Lectures, on the other hand, are
an entirely different matter. Where-
as I have made the rest of Gimpe-
rial life sound rather harsh, busy,
and unforgiving, lectures are the
safe haven where you are not only
guaranteed the world class educa-
tion that is offered here, but also
the much needed sleep you missed
the night before. Clearly then, as
you can see, your working life here
will have to be carefully balanced,
and remember that it is always
better to come in to lectures still
drunk rather than with a hangover
(that’s advice from somebody else
though).
Being serious just for a moment
though, whatever your race, reli-
gion (probably none), sex (prob-
ably male), or drinking preferences
(probably passed-out), you’re en-
tering a new chapter of your life
and fortunately it’s a pretty pleas-
ant one.
Pretty soon you’ll be out on the
weekends with your mates doing
whatever it is that takes your fancy.
Take a good look at Freshers’ Fair
and sign up for everything you may
have an interest in, you’ll be thank-
ful you did it later in the year. Don’t
fret about which hall you have be-
cause everyone will get more or
less the same deal after you fac-
tor in price, and for goodness sake
don’t pass out naked on the Queen’s
Lawn at any time. Enjoy your Gim-
perial life, and remember the rest
of us are here to help by making
your day just that slightest bit more
amusing.
Welcome to Gimperial!
“You will be
given the royal
treatment here at
Gimperial”
When politicians or the media
want the views of students, is it to
our Union or to the NUS that they
turn? Whilst we remain outside
of the NUS our voice is not being
heard. On the day of the top up-fees
vote in parliament, whilst the NUS
President was negotiating with the
Education Minister, all our own
President could access was a back-
bench MP who had already decided
how he was going to vote. Imperial
students deserve better. I am under
no illusions about the NUS; I have
no doubt that it needs reform. This
is a view shared by the NUS itself,
which has gone through root and
branch reform of its finances and
operations. We ensure that we have
an effective national body repre-
senting students by working con-
structively for reform from within,
not by sniping from the sidelines.
Edinburgh, which voted to join the
NUS in 2004, has been at the fore-
front of reforming the NUS. Should
Imperial join, we too would be at
the forefront of reforms.
Membership of the NUS is easily
one of the biggest issues faced by
Imperial students in recent times.
With our circumstances radically
changed by leaving the University
of London Union, it’s time for a sen-
sible debate. We simply cannot af-
ford to be isolated.
“Leaving ULU
will be a step
back… For the
first time in
over 50 years,
we will be
on our own,
isolated and
mute without a
national voice.”

W
elcome!
To all fresher
students, and
this is probably
not the first time
you’ve heard this, welcome to Im-
perial College! To all non-Fresher
students – welcome back! I hope
you have all enjoyed your well-
earned summer break and are
now prepared for the forthcoming
year.
Andy informs me that I will
be writing a weekly President’s
column for Felix to keep you all
posted on the latest news from
the Union. So I will start by telling
you a little bit about the excit-
ing refurbishment projects that
we’ve delivered this summer. The
Beit Building refurbishment is
well underway and the first full
venue revamp, Da Vinci’s, is now
complete. The promised new
lift is presently being installed
in the core of the building and
I will write about this project in
more detail in future columns.
Outside of South Kensington,
our Reynolds Bar has received a
facelift and the ground floor of the
student union building at Wye has
also been overhauled. We hope
you like these lovely new venues
and politely request that you treat
them well.
There is a lot more to ICU than
can be summarised in a short
article or a two minute freshers’
speech. So, for the first time in liv-
ing memory, we will be running a
Freshers’ General Meeting for all
students on Monday 9th October
at 6pm in the Union Concert Hall.
If you want to know more about
ICU and how you can get involved
in its activities, then please come
along to this event (refreshments
will, of course, be provided).
Finally, if you need to contact
me about these columns or chat
about anything that concerns or
interests you, then please don’t
hesitate to email me at presi-
dent@imperial.ac.uk.
On that note, have a brilliant
freshers’ week and a fantastic
year to come!
A very
warm
welcome
from the
Union
