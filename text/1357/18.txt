Greetings, cruciverbovoracists!
Carrying on with thematic puz-
zles, this week all the across clues
are undefined but are of a kind. The
theme is not altogether unrelated
to the one in my last puzzle and
should be easy to guess. Note a pe-
culiarity of 26 across which ‘turns a
corner’ into 27down, hence is only
seven letters (a word length other-
wise unavailable in this grid).
I had a feeling most of the clues
were a bit dull, so if you do enjoy any
inparticular,pleasewriteintocheer
me up. Good luck! Jabberwock

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
A bizarre accident
involving a length
of twine and four
hookers will send you
back in time to 1660.
You’ll spend your
week trying to explain to the locals
why you’re dressed oddly, but
they won’t listen. Finally, you’ll be
burned at the stake as a witch.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
You’re addicted to so-
cial networking sites,
and spend all your
waking hours check-
ing what your friends
are doing. However,
your bedsores are growing pain-
ful, so you’ll find yourself walking
the streets with a PDA, blogging
constantly.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
Your boyfriend will be
upset you spend all
your free time hunting
werewolves in the
streets of London.
You’ll confront your
nemesis in a deserted street be-
hind a Nandos. After shooting him
six times with revolver, his fur will
recede to reveal your lover.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
You’ll be stopped in
the street by a man
claiming to be your
son. He’ll claim that
you slept with his
mother fourteen years
ago. Explain to him you’re twenty
two, and could not have fathered
him aged eight. When he starts to
babble about time dilation, leave.
This Week’s Horoscopes
Gemini (Jan 20 – Feb 18)
When your path
crosses with a gyspy
lady near Tescos,
she’ll make a cross
sign and curse at you.
When you ask what
she means, she’ll explain that, in
the future, you’ll run her over and
kill her. Walk back to your car and
laugh heartily.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
Noel Edmonds will be
stalking you constant-
ly this week. Every-
where you look, you’ll
see his bearded face
peering at you over
the top of a newspaper, or from
behind a parked car. Confront him
about it before you’re forced to get
a restraining order.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
You’ll discover what
really happened at
Roswell, New Mexico,
in 1947. However,
before you can reach
a payphone to inform
the world’s press, you’ll be shot in
the head by a homeless man. Pas-
sers-by will be shocked, until the
homeless man explains he’s CIA.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
You’ll feel that a photo
of Abraham Lincoln is
watching every time
to defecate. In order
to prevent this, you’ll
only go to the toilet
while wearing a hood and mask.
This will backfire when you feel
the need to evacuate your bowels
while in a bank.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
While walking back
to your house from
the tube, you’ll meet
a beautiful young
woman. She’ll be
instantly attracted to
your suddenly apparent wit, and of-
fer to go home with you. When you
awake after a long night, she’ll be
gone, along with your wallet.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
Your librarian has
been giving you the
eye for the month. To-
day, you finally make
your move. As you
approach, wearing
your most debonair shirt, the copy
of Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code
will fall from your pocket, ruining
you chance of a lay.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
Every time you see
a Far Side cartoon,
you’ll experience
a brief moment of
unconciousness. Dur-
ing this time, you’ll
be unable to remember anything
that happens. When you awake,
you’ll find yourself in a wheelie bin
covered in sheep’s blood.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
The mushroom in
your shower will talk
to you this morning
while you complete
your daily ablutions.
It will explain that life
in your bathtub is dull. Cut it free
and take it with you to your first
lecture. It turns you into a mind-
less infectious spore.
