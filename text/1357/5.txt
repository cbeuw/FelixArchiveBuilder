I socialise,
therefore I sleep
How it might not just be listening to your
friends’ stories that’s making you drowsy
Freshers week. At last! The time to
throw off the shackles of mum and
dad, to let your hair down and to
P-A-R-T-Y! There’s nobody there to
tell you what to eat, or when to eat
it, no one to ask you ‘where do you
think you’re going?’ or to ask you
what time you’re coming back. But
best of all, no one to tell you when
to go to bed. This is university man,
you can sleep when you’re dead!
But recent research published
this week in Science indicates that
in fact, it may be those who socialise
the most who need the most sleep.
Indrani Ganguly-Fitzgerald and
her team at the Neurosciences
Institute in San Diego, California,
studied the sleeping habits of the
fruit fly Drosophila in various social
situations. They discovered that
flies that lived in groups needed
significantly more sleep than those
who were kept in isolation, and the
increased requirement for sleep
was correlated with the size of the
group.
Although the importance of sleep
was first indicated in the early ’80s,
when rats prevented from sleeping
dropped dead dramatically after
two weeks, it has not been until
recent years that the complicated
molecular basis of sleep has begun
to be unravelled. Drosophila, al-
though not mammals, are increas-
ingly used as models for studies
into the genetic basis of sleep due
to their surprisingly human like
behaviour.
Fruit flies can sleep up to 15 hours
a day, usually in one nocturnal
burst, and remove themselves from
their social counterparts to feed
and groom before tucking them-
selves into bed. Like a sleepy stu-
dent on a Monday morning, those
flies who have slept the longest are
hardest to wake, and they too try to
catch up on lost shuteye, although
like humans Drosophila only seem
to able to make up 30-40% of a ‘sleep
debt’.
Most importantly however, both
humans and Drosophila appear to
share the molecular mechanisms
of sleep, making discoveries eas-
ily transferable to human sleep
research, with antihistamines also
making the fruit fly drowsy and un-
safe to operate heavy machinery,
and caffeine keeping them up all
night.
So what do these new results
mean? Is social activity so exhaust-
ing that you need to rest more to
recover? Should the social mayhem
of Fresher’s week be reduced to
lights out at 10pm with a nice mug
of cocoa? And why? The answer
may lie in the idea of ‘synaptic plas-
ticity’, the process of making new
connections between neurons in
the brains, which is believed to be
closely linked to sleep.
Previously, all sleep research in
Drosophila has focussed on differ-

ential levels of gene expression in
the sleeping/waking state. Howev-
er, in June of this year, Nature pub-
lished a report showing that when
electrical activity was blocked in
the areas of the Drosophila brain
linked to remembering smell was,
flies slept for much shorter peri-
ods, suggesting what any franti-
cally cramming student will know-
that sleep is needed to consolidate
memory.
To Ganguly-Fitzgerald, the con-
nection is clear. The social flies in
the study ‘mate, they fight. They
form memories about the interac-
tions they’ve had, and they make
descisions’. And then, they sleep.
Isolated flies, and those with re-
duced sensory input (blinded, or
with a reduced sense of smell) both
received less information during
the day, and accordingly, required
fewer hours of sleep to commit
their experiences to memory.
Unfortunately for freshers, the
implications are clear. You might
be going out every night and danc-
ing the night away with that hot
girl from your 9 o’clock, but it is
not you, but nerdy Norman down
the corridor who has not ventured
from his room since day one who
will remember what her name is.
And more importantly, we finally
have an explanation for the inverse
relationship between number of
people met and ability to remem-
ber all their names, where they
come from, what A-levels they did,
what they did on their gap year…
But sadly, science still has no way
of stopping them from telling you
again and again and again.
