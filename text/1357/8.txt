Summary of this week’s business news
The Federal Reserve Open Mar-
ket Committee (FOMC) decided
to leave the federal funds rate un-
changed at 5.25 per cent. The news
came as no surprise to economists
given the fall in America’s headline
rate of inflation in August by more
than expected. This was largely
due to decelerated energy inflation,
which was 0.3 per cent in August
compared with 2.9 per cent in July.
The regulation of hedge funds
was brought into question after
a Connecticut based firm – Ama-
ranth Advisors – lost billions of dol-
lars because of bad positions in the
natural-gas futures market. Invest-
ment bank Goldman Sachs specu-
lates the losses could reach 65 per
cent of the entire fund. Christopher
Cox, the head of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC)
warned individual investors of the
high risks potentially pertaining to
hedge funds.
JPMorgan Securities Japan lost
millions of dollars on Tuesday due
to an erroneous sell order on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. Similar inci-
dences have plagued the exchange
in the past, including the high-
profile bad trade made by Muziho
Securities that resulted in shares
being mistakenly sold for a Yen. In
this case, however, the TSE spotted
an unusual trade in advance and
warned JPMorgan. As a result only
a small proportion of the trade went
through. The firm released a state-
ment admitting it had sold a group
of stocks in the Topix index instead
of stocks in the Nikkeir 225. JPMor-
gan refused to put a figure on the
losses.
Europe and Japan heavily criti-
cised the anticompetitive actions
of Russia, which withdraw a per-
mit on environmental grounds.
The permit was necessary for a $20
billion Royal Dutch Shell energy-
project. The action has increased
the chances of Gazprom – Russia’s
state-owned gas monopoly – claim-
ing the project as its own.
The European Aeronautic De-
fence and Space Company (EADS)
announced further setbacks in
the production of the Airbus A380,
putting pressure on its share price.
No specific details were given, but a
review is expected soon.
Bill Ford, chairman of automotive
giant Ford, has employed the serv-
ices of Sir John Bond – Vodafone’s
chairman and former chairman of
HSBC. He will act as a part-time
financial consultant to Mr Ford.
After an uncertain year, investors
showed renewed faith after the un-
veiling of plans to close two plants
and cut 10,000 white-collar jobs.
Scania, a Swedish lorry manu-
facturer, rejected a takeover bid
from MAN, a German competitor.
Volkswagen, the leading share-
holder, believed the offer of 9.6 bil-
lion euros undervalued the com-
pany, whilst Renault, with a 5 per
cent stake in Scania, supported the
deal.
Dieter Zetsche, chairman of
Chrysler, predicted the company
would make a loss this year, contra-
ry to analyst predictions of a profit.
The company will be making cuts
in the near future and continues to
lose its share in the North Ameri-
can market.
Motorola made its largest acqui-
sition since 2000 after agreeing to
buy Symbol Technologies for $3.9
billion. Symbol manufactures hand-
held devices for tracking stock
and radio-identification tags, and
will broaden Motorola’s logistics
division.
The Swiss pharmaceutical com-
pany Serono, which has been
searching for a buyer for some time,
is to be bought by Merk. The Ger-
man rival said it would buy the 64.5
per cent stake currently held by the
Bertarelli family for $13.3 billion.
Telecom Italia’s restructuring
programme resulted in the chair-
man resigning over allegations of
government intervention.
TI intended to spin off its fixed-
line and mobile business so it could
concentrate on broadband and
media services. The centre-left
government plans to oppose the
scheme but TI is committed and
plans to acquire AOL Broadband in
Germany.

With the dawn of the new academic
year comes a new recruitment cy-
cle and a fresh batch of undergrad-
uates wondering what they want to
do for the rest of their lives between
weekends. Many see the financial
services industry as intimidating or
dry, but closer examination can re-
veal a dynamic, exciting and meri-
tocratic working environment.
The most prolific employers of
university graduates are invest-
ment banks, accountancy firms, in-
surance and actuarial companies,
and management consultants.
Investment banks offer under-
graduates from all disciplines ca-
reer paths to suite most tastes.
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A)
bankers work closely with large
multinationals on long-term
projects in an attempt to efficiently
restructure them. Juniors - known
as analysts - are expected to work
into the small hours of the morn-
ing calculating financial models or
writing pitch books for clients. The
high pay and invaluable business
experience makes this an attrac-
tive choice.
The sales and trading depart-
ments offer slightly more sociable
hours but the work is fast-paced
and not for the faint hearted. Sales
people and traders work to bring
buyers and sellers of financial secu-
rities together. Despite this simple
premise, the job can be exception-
ally complicated because the trader
must ensure that, overall, he or she
ends up making a small margin on
everything bought and sold whilst
still offering competitive prices.
Private bankers or asset man-
agers pool together the cash of
wealthy individuals or clients such
as pension funds. They create port-
folios consisting of a range of in-
vestments, from stocks to bonds to
gold and property.
Those with an interest in invest-
ment banking should ensure they
have an extensive CV with exam-
ples of teamwork and innovation,
because competition is fierce. En-
sure you are familiar with the in-
dustry you are interested in and the
company you are applying for.
The large firms run summer
internships for those in their pe-
nultimate year of study, which you
can apply for online through their
websites.
It might seem an obvious point,
but knowing about the company you
are interested in is essential. A re-
cruiter from Royal Dutch Shell re-

The action of merging or acquiring
(M&A) a company is far more com-
plicated than buying most other
assets. There are several legal, tax
and accounting issues to be dealt
with. This week, we shall briefly ex-
amine these topics.
No matter how practicable a deal
may seem, competition laws must
be considered. No acquisition may
take place if the effect may be to
substantially lessen competition or
tend towards creating a monopoly.
Once the antitrust hurdle has
been passed, the form of acquisi-
tion needs to be considered. One
way is for a company to assume all
the assets and all the liabilities of
the other. Conducting the merger
in this way requires the approval
of at least 50 per cent of the stock
holders of each firm.
An alternative is to simply buy the
company being sold in exchange for
cash, shares or sometimes other
securities. This method does not re-
quire the approval of the seller’s top
management, although it is gener-
ally sought. A hostile takeover can
result if they resist, in which the
buyer will attempt to acquire an ef-
fective majority of the outstanding
shares. The final method is to buy
some or all of the seller’s assets.
The tax status of an acquisition
can affect the taxes paid by the
merged firm. Cash deals are tax-
able for capital gains tax. But share
swaps are tax-free, and the stock-
holders are viewed as exchanging
their old shares in company A for
similar new ones in company B.
Academics view the corporate
merger as a fulfilment of the econo-
mies of scale theory that stipulates
free markets tend towards having
as few companies and brand names
as possible. In summary, the theory
argues that by merging and grow-
ing into large multinationals, com-
panies’ production costs are re-
duced for a number of reasons. On
a simplistic level, one example is
decreased production costs permit-
ted by bulk buying. You may then
question the justification and moti-
vation for corporations in different
lines of business merging.
There are fundamentally three
kinds: the vertical, horizontal and
conglomerate mergers. The hori-
zontal kind combines two compa-
nies in the same line of business,
for example, Vodafone and German
telecom giant Mannesmann. The
vertical variety involves compa-
nies at different stages of produc-
tion. The buyer either expands the
company back towards the source
of raw materials, or forwards it in
the direction of the consumer. For
example, Walt Disney acquired the
ABC television network.
The conglomerate merger in-
volves companies in unrelated
fields joining forces. The justifica-
tion being, that costs might be cut
by sharing central services such as
accounting. Nevertheless, corpo-
rations are under the influence of
shareholders and top-management
executives, leading to dubious mo-
tives for mergers.
In 2000 AOL acquired Time Warn-
er. This conglomerate made corpo-
rate history with a record-breaking
$156billionworthofstockpurchased
by AOL to acquire Time Warner.
The new company promised to fulfil
the consumer’s media and informa-
tion needs. Unfortunately, profits in
the company slumped, resulting in
an 80% decline in the share value.

counted an interview where a can-
didate thought that the company’s
sole line of work was “petrol sta-
tions.” In actual fact the retail fuel
garages break even. Shell makes its
money by refining and transporting
crude oil and crude products.

Accountants manage and analyse
the movement of cash within com-
panies. Whether a local plumber
or a multinational, all businesses
need to have financial statements
written up.
Cash-flow is important for work-
ing out how much money a compa-
ny makes, who it owes, who owes it
and how much tax is owed.
Accountants are increasingly be-
coming involved with strategic de-
cisions, managing risk and helping
businesses thrive.
As well as the College Careers
Service, there are student-led ca-
reers societies offering you the
chance to attend networking events
hosted by companies.
At this time of year Imperial Col-
lege Finance Society (ICSF) and
Student Industrial Society (SIS)
host investment banks, account-
ancy and other firms, who come to
Imperial and give interactive talks
on their business areas. They also
give you the chance to talk to em-
ployees young and old.
