Sabbaticals to be sued?
Three sabbatical officers of the Un-
ion have been sent an official letter
from a Hong Kong solicitors’ office
threatening legal action unless a
decision to suspend the Chinese
Society over alleged financial ir-
regularities is reversed.
On Saturday September 23, as the
sabbs were gearing up for officer
training out at Wye, they received
an e-mail from Wong & Co solicitors,
who are acting on behalf of Miss
Emily Chow, the current Chair of
Chinese Society. The letter was ad-
dressed to the former Union Presi-
dent, Sameena Misbahuddin, the
current President, John Collins, as
well as Eric Lai (Deputy President,
Clubs & Societies) and Jon Mat-
thews (Deputy President, Finance
& Services). The letter disputes
the recent decision to suspend the
Chinese Society and deny them a
stall at Freshers’ Fair after various
financial irregularities regarding
the sale of membership and the dis-
appearance of money made from
events came to light, calling it “en-
tirelywithoutmerits,non-substanti-
ated [sic] and accordingly invalid”.
The deadline set by the solicitors
for the reversal of this suspension
is today, five days from the sending
of the letter, leaving the sabbs only
three working days to reply. The let-
ter threatens that unless the deci-
sion is reversed, the solicitors will
“instruct [their] client’s legal agent
in the UK to exhaust every possible
legal means in redressing the un-
fairness and grievances including
but not limited to seeking injunctive
relief…from a UK court”, as well as
holding the sabbs responsible for
any legal costs or incidental losses
that might be suffered by ICCS.
According to records available on
the Imperial College Union finance
website, which lists all the budgets
and transactions of clubs and soci-
eties, the Chinese Society banked
£500 in membership money from
one hundred members, with mem-
bership costing £5. However, it has
recentlycometolightthattheSocie-
ty has been selling multi-year mem-
berships to its members for £10.

As Mr Matthews stated in an e-mail
to the President of Chinese Society,
Emily Chow, and the treasurer, Wai
Wong, this is “wholly unacceptable
and against Union policy”. Mem-
bership to clubs can only be sold
to members or life members of the
Union, and should a student fail
to complete their course of study
and forfeit membership of the Un-
ion, they cannot be members of
any clubs or societies, rendering
multi-year memberships unfeasi-
ble. The evidence for this has come
directly from society members con-
tacted by Mr Lai, several of whom
have confirmed that they were sold
multi-year memberships for £10. As
none of this ‘extra’ money has been
banked into the Chinese Society’s
account, this raises the question of
what has happened to it. If this mon-
ey has been deposited in an exter-
nal bank account, the Society may
be held responsible for withholding
funds, which may be construed as
theft, and VAT fraud, as a result of
operating a second bank account to
take membership money on which
VAT would not have been paid.
This is not the first time the soci-
ety has run into trouble with their
finances. At last year’s Freshers’
Fair, it was found to be taking mem-
bership money from prospective
members, in express violation of
Union rules. Nearly £700 was con-
fiscated from the society’s stall af-
ter the breach was discovered. The
society has also been warned on
previous occasions about the sell-
ing of multi-year memberships. In
addition, the society is currently in
almost £1,900 in debt.
Felix has obtained copies of e-
mails sent between the parties, and
a copy of the solicitors’ letter. Mr
Matthews and Mr Lai contacted
Miss Chow and her treasurer via
e-mail at the start of August, when
the irregularities came to light. As
this took place during the summer
vacation, Miss Chow requested
that the issue be resolved using e-
mail or over the telephone. Mr Mat-
thews subsequently informed Miss
Chow by e-mail on August 7 that
