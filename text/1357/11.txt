This album is perhaps not the best
album out there. It is however made
by a vital band. The reason for this
is Steve Albini. He is well-known
for his production on Pixies albums
and the last Nirvana album. He
has produced so many influential
albums that he has a certain myth
about him. Albini has also been in
legendary bands such as Big Black
and Rapeman but Shellac is per-
haps more accessible. Watch Song
is fantastic song dedicated to the
stupidity of brawling and fighting.
Possibly another obvious choice for
essential albums. But I am tired
and need to hand this in in five min-
utes. Ahem, I mean it is still an in-
fluential album and can introduce
the listener to a whole new sonic
territory.
This album may not feature Love
Will Tear Us Apart but it still con-
tains fantastic songs. These include
She’s Lost Control which is incred-
ibly eerie yet very immediate. This
album not only focuses on melody
and rhythm but puts a large em-
phasis on sound. At once sparse
and vast, the sonic landscape that
is painted is an ear-opener.
The record has an industrial ve-
neer that could have only been con-
veyed in the grey that is Manches-
ter in the late seventies.
Jazz, jazz, oh jazz. One of the most
maligned genres around. If you are
a fan of jazz then I’m sure you know
about this album. This is the last
album in the classic quartet form.
After this album, Coltrane went
avant-garde and alongside with Or-
nette Coleman, wandered into new
Yet another band to emerge from
the Olympia, Washington scene -
which also spat out Bikini Kill and
Nirvana amongst others - but relo-
cated to Austin, Texas. Trail of Dead
mash together the indie rock noise-
making of Sonic Youth with more
rock’n’roll influences. It is high oc-
tane melodicism and reflects the
Austin, Texas scene at the time. For
classic rock fans this album can ex-
pand your tastes whilst giving you
something you can still relate to.
This is an album that a lot of people
have heard of but have not actually
heard. It is a seminal hip hop album
in every aspect. The music uses in-
fectious and brilliant samples with
hardline political views.
It is hard to deny the greatness
of an album which feature tracks
such as Don’t Believe the Hype and
Rebel Without a Pause. If you ever
needed music to soundtrack your
slow politicism at university or just
general angst then put this on.
This album might seem a bit obvi-
ous but it has London in the title, so
that’s why it is in. Also, it’s a punk
album that brushes with a lot of
genres.
The Clash’s 1979 opus is the ulti-
mate London album from the ulti-
mate London band. From the open-
ing striking chords of the title track
you’re dragged through a machine
gun blitz of punk, rock’n’roll, reg-
gae and everything in between. All
of this is topped off with Joe Strum-
mer’s visceral lyrics. Quite simply
a classic.

This is one of the true iconic albums
of the 90s. If you like Mogwai, then
maybe you’ll know that they owe
everything to Slint. This album
spawned more genres that you can
count on one hand. Math-rock, post-
rock, indie-rock, whatever you call
it, the music is constantly shifting
and evades pigeon-holing.
Folk is becoming more acceptable
at the moment and is not just dis-
missed as music for bearded old
men. Nick Drake’s Nine Leaves
Left is a nice place to start but
slightly obvious. Iron & Wine also of-
fer beautiful music however it’s still
very traditional. Animal Collective
are from New York and add a lush
experimental edge to sparse folk
yet retaining a pop edge. Magic.
Forget The Automatic and The
Kooks, Pavement are real indie-
pop. Where the former bands tread
the same ideas and melodies used
so many times before, Pavement
were real experimenters.
Their first album, Slanted and
Enchanted remains a classic to this
day. However a good place to start
with Pavement is their second al-
bum, Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain.
This album is better produced and
more accessible that their debut
but Stephen Malkmus’ (who also
was in Silver Jews) lyrics are still
insanely skewed and sharply bril-
liant. Cut Your Hair is so immedi-
ately great in its sardonic nature
that it is irresistible.
Everyone has heard of Sonic Youth
but they are often associated with
Nirvana and that horrible word,
‘grunge’. This is purely due to bad
timing. Whilst Nirvana were still
tuning up, Sonic Youth had emerged
out of the no-wave scene with two
fantastic albums, Sister and Day-
dream Nation.
Opener, Teen Age Riot is per-
haps one of the most perfect songs
around. It’s loud, catchy, sexy (Kim
Gordon’s intro does that to you) and
fast. What more could you need?
Well, possibly 13 more tracks of
more brilliance and that’s what you
get. Sonic Youth were, and still are,
one of the major inspirations to any
band that wanted to sound different.
Thurston Moore, in many a music
patron’s eyes, is a god and his label,
Ecstatic Peace, is awash with fan-
tastic bands. Avoid at your peril!

undiscovered territories.
However I find this album a beau-
tiful one for those who don’t re-
ally know much about jazz. For one
thing, this album has a collective
theme of faith and worship. There
is poetry in the liner notes of the
sleeve which indicate this theme.
There is an air of melody within
these pieces making the improvi-
sation easier to grasp onto. The
title track has an instantly catchy
bassline and ends with the title be-
ing sung over the bassline.

Hello, hi and wilkommen to the vast
plane of mid-20th century archi-
tecture that is Imperial College. If
you haven’t yet strained your eyes
about two and a half inches upward
on this page; this is the music sec-
tion of the mighty organ that is Fe-
lix. Now for the patronising bit.
University should be a voyage of
discovery. There are parts to you
that you may not even know about.
We are not suggesting that you in-
vest in a room full of mirrors so you
can perpetually observe your neth-
er regions. Okay, let’s start again...
When we first came to univer-
sity, we wanted to learn about as
much as possible, both inside and
outside our ‘proper’ subjects. This
naturally included music and its
various forms. You might be equally
inquisitive.
So here at Felix, we’d thought
we’d offer you up some of the al-
bums that we adored in our first
year. Along with these, there is a
list of 10 ‘essential’ albums that can
help open you up to a vast world of
music that lies ahead, if you wish to
persue it. They’re not necessarily
the best albums ever but the ones
that can expand your tastes.
We don’t wish to patronise you,
just to suggest some stuff that you
might like. If you think we are smok-
ing some of that crack stuff that we
keep hearing about, and our sugges-
tions are awful, or if you can think
of other albums everyone should
definitely hear then get in touch.
This section is always looking
for reviewers. The rewards of this
is that you get access to FREE
gigs and FREE CDs and in return
we should want you to write about
them. Or if gig photography is a
passion of yours then we can exhibit
your work. Also it is a great oppor-
tunity to meet like-minded people.
This section is run by three edi-
tors so that the workload of being
a music editor doesn’t clash with
out degree studies, since we are
all in our third year here. It also
means that there should be at least
one of us around for you to harass.
You can get in touch by popping
along to the Felix stall at Freshers’
Fair or by e-mailing us at music.
felix@imperial.ac.uk. Don’t worry
if you haven’t done any reviews be-
fore. Our first years were the first
time that we had ever put fingers
to keyboards and ranted away.
The music section will also be
helping to put on a gig on in the
union on October 13th. We have
selected a band to play along-
side two bands that are playing
on that night. The section is also
connected to the Alternative Mu-
sic Society and so look out for
events organised by them here.
Enjoy this week’s feature and
reviews. If you want to contrib-
ute, please don’t hesitate to get
involved. Without voluntary con-
tributions we would be nothing!
