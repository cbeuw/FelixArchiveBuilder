London School of Excess
LSE has nicer girls than IC? Surely not!
Although there are better things
I can think of doing for a night out
than spending it with a load of econ-
omists, it has to be said that LSE’s
union is certainly enviable. It’s pop-
ular, they have leather seats, multi-
ple floors, more of the female gen-
der, and it’s even a little cheaper.
I know what you’re thinking. Bas-
tards. Don’t let anything put you off
going, though, because one of the
all round best outings in London
is one of their flagship nights, on
the pleasingly convenient Saturday
slot. There’s also a big clubnight on
Fridays called Crush, but it’s best
not to mention my experience with
that one (it involved pouring alco-
hol down my ears to drown out that
horrendous noise people call urban
‘music’).
Afterskool has been going for a
while now, and it describes itself as
an indie and electro night. Amongst
the usual suspects, there’s a certain
New Wave influence amongst it all,
with the likes of Talking Heads and
David Bowie rearing their heads
for the dancefloor once again.
There, are of course, your usual
indie anthems which they pump
out through the speakers, expect
to hear something like Love Will
Tear Us Apart or Common Peo-
ple at some point or another, most
likely towards the end of the night.
There’s also your standard selec-
tion of relatively new and dance-
able indie hits; The Arcade Fire
are certainly popular, and whether
you like them or not, there’s the
seemingly omnipresent Franz Fer-
dinand with their various remixes
to keep you throwing funky shapes
(although, readers, I must say who-
ever did that remix of the first 3
notes of Do You Want To that lasts
about 13 minutes will pay for leg in-
jury for dancing too long, I fucking
swear). A lot of the night concen-
trates on the stuff the NME indie
kids listen to, I’m talking We Are
Scientists and the like, it’s not re-
ally as heavy as Club NME [Hardly
surprising – Greg] on that side but
it certainly veers more on the main-
stream than a lot of the more elit-
ist places in London. It may sound
a bit strange to criticize a night of
it, but personally I do feel that Af-
terskool sometimes skimps a bit on
the electronic side of their moniker
– there’s a fair bit of 80s stuff that
has synthesizers, but don’t get your
hopes up thinking you’re going to
be having a night of dance music -
this is strictly for guitar and guitar/
electronic hybrid stuff.
I have this unshakeable feeling
that this place reminds me of the
infamous Mancunian venue The
Haçienda (if you don’t know what
that is, then may I suggest the rath-
er great Steve Coogan movie 24
Hour Party People). The main area
spans two stories, and has whack-
ing great big pillars running down
from a balcony, which you can look
over onto the dancefloor from. It’s
a nice enough area if you’ve had a
few too many pints and need some-
where to relax, as it’s less hectic
than the main area.
Below hence lies the bar, which
as I mentioned, is extraordinarily
cheap: may the lord bless student
unions. It’s usually under two quid
for a pint, in fact, I’ve found the rule
of thumb is that it’s about 5-10p
cheaper than Imperial. This means
that, for a change, you can actually
get drunk on something you like
and spend as much as you would
at an average pub, without having
to make do with whatever piss hap-
pened to be on special offer. Panic,
I’m looking at you, with your sod-
ding Kronenburg (however you do
play Belle & Sebastian loads, so I
still love you).
And then there’s the atmosphere.
Okay, so you’ll still see the occasion-
al music elitist with stupid hair and
a ridiculous hat (guilty as charged)
as is per usual in indie establish-
ments, but Afterskool is largely full
of – well – students! Respectable
students! Not that I have anything
bad to say about the fine ladies at
somewhere like, just a random
club, Cheapskates, but it’s a some-
what fun and friendly atmosphere,
it’s not full of horny males and nei-
ther is it full of music scenesters
that are just too cool to dance.
So, it’s easy to find, easy to get
back from (you’ve got to love those
buses in Camden at 3 in the morn-
ing, that only run once an hour and
never go anywhere useful), a good
time of the week, damn cheap, and
has a great atmosphere. About the
only complaint I can level against
this place is that I wish it played
more varied music, but it’s a minor
critique, and one I’m sure won’t ap-
ply to 99% of you kids out there. If
you enjoy indie music in the slight-
est – this is essential stuff.
Matt “The Hat” Long
Greg and Alex’s super duper club
recommendations for the week!
Since you may have just joined IC,
and not be from London, or even
from the UK, then we’ve been kind
enough to write a little list of club-
nights we might visit throughout
the week, either because they are
good or cheap. Either way, I suggest
that if you don’t like Indie or Electro
then destroy this article now.
Monday
It’s the start of the week, and you
get to meet us in the flesh at Seen
at The Fly on New Oxford Street.
You can even touch our faces. That
starts at 7pm and finishes at mid-
night, just in time to make your way
over the road to Trash at The End,
where you will be swiftly removed
from the queue unless your clothes
and musical taste are up to stand-
ard (fashion show Indie).
Tuesday
You will not be hungover as the
drinks at Trash are extortionately
priced. Make your way over to The
Roxy on Rathbone Place for Panic!
a perfect student type Indie/Electro
night sure to please all but the most
snobbish of you with £1.50 drinks all
night.
Wednesday
Venture over to Notting Hill for
Death Disco, with Alan McGee
at the Notting Hill Arts Club, get
there before 8pm and you’ll get in
for free, which coincides with the
start of happy hour. Expect to hear
an eclectic mix of Indie, Post-Punk,
and a bit of Electro. They also have
live bands.
Thursday
Get over to Candybox at Moonlight-
ing, if you fancy a horrible night
of Indie cheese. The questionable
choice of music is balanced by the
£1.00 house spirit and mixers, so
turn up with £20 and leave totally
wasted.
Friday
In the olden days before Our Disco
was so cruelly removed from it’s
home at Plastic People, it would
guarantee a decent Friday night.
However there are still some com-
mendable options, check 333 on Old
Street for monthly clubnights that
can be hit and miss, or Cargo, also
around Old Street for a varied mix
of live acts.
Saturday
Afterskool, the best student In-
die clubnight in London, hosted at
LSE’s student union (see review)
is a great option, the DJ’s are good
and the drinks are quite cheap. Oth-
er options include irregular club-
nights at The Barfly (live bands)
and maybe something at the Union,
if you’re very very lucky.
Sunday
Sleep, or do some work (hah!)
We didn’t have any photos, so heres a picture of their fliers instead.
Afterskool Klub
LSE Union
Free before midnight, £6 after,
£5 NUS/Flyer
HHHHI
H
ello, and welcome to
another fun packed
year at Imperial,
hopefully you’ve had
a wonderful holiday
(actually I hope it was rubbish)
and you havent missed university
life too much.
For you Freshers out there,
we’ve prepared a wonderful
specially made section for you
this week, filled with competi-
tions, student friendly clubnight
reviews, and even a guide to
some of our favourite clubnights
of the week, we really suggest you
go to them, they are great, plus
you’ll have the chance to meet
the beautiful Alex.
Speaking of which, some of my
regular fans may be wondering
who the hell is the Alex character
invading our favourite section,
well he has kindly volounteered
his services to take over the
nightlife editorial while I am in re-
hab for the next few months, but
don’t start destroying every copy
of Felix in sight yet, for hopefully I
will return after Christmas where
Alex and I will bring you the most
awesome-a-saurus rex articles,
and even more awesome made
up words.
Our main review today is of Af-
terskool, courtesy of Leather Hat
Matt, one of our most esteemed
reviewers. As for the competion,
we decided not to keep all the
tickets for ourselves so we’re
giving away a load of free stuff!
Make sure you email in to Night-
life for the chance to win these
wonderful prizes. If you don’t
email in you have no chance at all
of winning!
That’s all we can think of writ-
ing this week, so read on and we
hope you love all the genuinely
amazing events during Freshers
Week.
Fancy free entry to
any club any time?
