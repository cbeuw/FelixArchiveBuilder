Freshers’ Albums
As a Fresher into music, you’re
assumed to know about certain
albums. This little guide will either
have you nodding in agreement
or frantically talking notes in
order to blag it the next time a
hot indie girl talks to you about
Sonic Youth.

Afterskool
“Okay, so you’ll still see the

stupid hair and a ridiculous hat

usual in indie establishments, but
Afterskool is largely full of – well
– students!” PAGE 18

Homophobia in Islamic Soc
Two members of Islamic Society have been accused of posting
“violently homophobic” remarks on a Union forum
Several members of the Islamic So-
ciety have been accused of homo-
phobia and inciting violence against
homosexuals after posts made on a
forum hosted by the Union.
The chair of IQ, a society that
aims to represent and support gay,
lesbian, bisexual and transgender
students at the College, reported
posts he’d discovered on the ISoc
forum in an email sent to the Sab-
batical Officers, the President of
the Union, the Felix Editor, and the
Live! Editor. The posts were part of
a discussion concerning a recent
Channel 4 documentary about the
plight of homosexual Muslims in
Britain, and were made in late Jan-
uary of this year.
While many of the posts were
articulate discussions of the teach-
ing of the Qu’ran and the poster’s
own opinions on the subject, sev-
eral posts, originating mainly from
two individuals (posting under the
names Al Chemist and Haji), were
more extreme in their views. One
of the earliest posts in the thread,
made by Haji, stated that his ‘solu-
tion’ to homosexual Muslims was
simple: “batter them.” Al Chemist
expressed his distaste for the con-
cept of homosexuality, inferring
that gay Muslims were not proper
Muslims: “them and some other
‘Muslims’ are on my hitlist”. Within
a few hours of the tip-off email, sev-
eral of the comments had been ed-
ited, including those made by Haji,
who replaced the word “batter” in
his post with the less offensive “ver-
bally batter”.
The Union has indicated it con-
siders this a very serious matter,
as it breaches several College and
Union rules concerning the use of
IT resources and equal opportuni-
ties policies, and has subsequently
worked closely with ICT, the College
IT service, and the Islamic Society
to identify the individuals posting
under the names Haji and Al Chem-
ist. In a post later in the thread, Haji
signed off as “Sagir (Haji) Hassam”;
it has since been confirmed in a
comment made by Mr Hassam to
the City & Guilds online newspaper,
Live!, that he did indeed post under
the name Haji. Mr Hassam was
one of several students disqualified
from last year’s Union Council elec-
tions after investigations by Coun-
cil and the Returning Officer dis-
covered they had used mailing lists
to campaign, which is forbidden by
the Union Constitution. When he
made the posts to the forum, Mr
Hassam, who now works for UBS,
was an Officer of the Union, holding
the positions of Vice President of
the IC Finance Society, and Public-
ity Officer for Islamic Society.
John Collins, the Union Presi-
dent, has made clear that he does
not hold Islamic Society respon-
sible for the comments of the two
members. He confirmed that the
Society had been asked to remove
the posts within a week; at the time
of going to press, the entire forum
had been deactivated.
Mr Hassam has made both an offi-
cial statement to Live!, and numer-
ous comments on the article itself.
His defence is that he was misinter-
preted, and that his communication
skills were not sufficient to correct-
ly convey his opinions on the mat-
ter, stating: “I have realised in ret-
rospect that my individual thoughts
were incorrectly communicated on
this thread, and I did post further
along the thread that “batter” was
a much too strong word, I meant
batter in terms of a verbal batter-
ing i.e. numerous discussions, not
physically hurting anyone. I would
never condone unprovoked violent
actions against anyone regardless
of sexual orientation, race or gen-
der.” Other commentators on the
article have been somewhat scep-
tical of this claim, with one anony-
mous wag calling himself “Wiggly
Worm” replying: “Wiggle wiggle
wiggle! Haji needs to get out of this
pickle!”
The posts could also be said
to be an incitement to violence,
though this is currently under con-
sideration by Union and College
authorities.
As Sagir Hassam has graduated
and left the College, there can be
no disciplinary procedure brought
against him. The identity of Al
Chemist is uncertain, and he has
not come forward voluntarily. In-
vestigations are continuing to at-
tempt to determine his identity.
A screengrab of one of the posts made by ‘Al Chemist’
any multi-year membership would
be cancelled, and that the Society
could not trade at Freshers’ Fair.
He also requested a list of names
and CID numbers of people who
had bought multi-year member-
ships, clarifying that he did not
blame Miss Chow and her treasur-
er directly, as they were not on the
committee last year. A number of
other restrictions were also placed
on the Society, in light of past trans-
gressions, including enforcing on-
line voting for society elections in
the coming year. Mr Matthews re-
iterated that the society must abide
by the current rules, such as having
all events being approved by an ap-
propriate officer of the Union, and
a requirement that all income and
expenditure be run through the Un-
ion accounts.
No reply was received from Miss
Chow for a week, at which point Mr
Matthews contacted her again, on
August 15, to confirm receipt of the
previous email, and to reiterate the
request for a list of names of CID
numbers of those who bought mul-
ti-year memberships. Again, the
request went unanswered. On Sep-
tember 11, having received no reply
from either of the two recipients, Mr
Lai and Mr Matthews took the deci-
sion to suspend the Society’s ac-
tivities for the duration of Freshers’
Week, thus preventing them from
having a stall at Freshers’ Fair and
raising online membership. No re-
ply was received. On September 23,
the solicitors’ letter arrived in the
inboxes of the three Sabbaticals, as
well as the notoriously leaky Union
Reception email inbox.
The letter claims that Miss Chow
did not know multi-year member-
ships were being sold, and that this
occurred under the supervision of
the previous committee members,
as Mr Matthews does not dispute.
It also claims that she did not know
they were not supposed to sell
multi-year memberships, but the e-
mails sent by Mr Matthews seem to
suggest that the Society as a whole
had been told previously. It is sug-
gested that this information was
not passed over to the new Com-
mittee members at their unusually
early handover date of April 1.
The letter also discusses the lack
of reply to Mr Matthews’ e-mails.
According to the letter, Miss Chow
returned to Hong Kong from Guam
on August 7, the date of Mr Mat-
thews’ first e-mail. The letter says
that after this, she went with her
parents to a “retreat in preparation
of spiritual enhancement” prior
to her departing for India on Sep-
tember 8. During this period, Miss
Chow received two e-mails from
Mr Matthews, and replied to nei-
ther of them. Felix has discovered
that while at a retreat “in prepa-
ration of spiritual enhancement”,
she nonetheless had access to the
Internet. Miss Chow made posts on
Facebook, that well-known spiritual
resource, to two of her friends, on
August 8 and August 23 – the first
explaining she was back in Hong
Kong and the second expressing
the fact that she was busy “hold-
ing freshers’ reception, orientation
camp and parties”. This is likely
to refer to the events ICCS holds
in Hong Kong for freshers prior to
them arriving at the College, ac-
cording to Felix’s source. Questions
have also been raised over an event
held by the ICCS in Hong Kong in
partnership with the Hong Kong
Society of Warwick University, and
others. Neither the OSC Chair nor
the Deputy President (Finance and
Services) knew anything about this
event being held, and no reference
is made to it in the accounts of the
ICCS. The tickets cost HK$200,
whichisabout£13.Itisnotclearhow
the money was divided between the
participating University societies,
though no money has been paid
into the ICCS Union account. It is
highly likely that, as the event was
held in Hong Kong, there has been
no opportunity for the members to
inform the Union of the takings.
It is understood that Miss Chow
has contacted Vernon McClure, Ac-
ademic Registrar, who acts as the
Head of the Registry, asking him to
represent her in this situation. As
ICU’s disciplinary procedure has
not yet been invoked over the al-
leged financial irregularities on ei-
ther the previous committee or the
new committee, the College is not
permitted to be involved.
Miss Chow’s complaint seems to
centre around a statement made
in an e-mail by Mr Lai, which said:
“This is a very serious matter,
which could lead to your degree
being withheld or yourselves being
removed from the College.” The so-
lictors’lettercommentsonthis,say-
ing that Miss Chow and Miss Wong,
the treasurer of ICCS are seeking
advice on “whether or not such a
statement is defamatory”. Felix’s
copy of the Oxford English Diction-
ary defines defamation as “an at-
tack on the good fame or reputation
of a person”, making it questionable
whether Mr Lai’s statement could
be construed in such a way. The
College authorities have confirmed
that Mr Lai was correct in saying
that a College disciplinary process
could result the “permanent ex-
pulsion” of a student from the Col-
lege; however, this punishment is
reserved for the most serious of of-
fences, such as bringing the name
of the College into disrepute.
The grounds for suspension of the
society are the selling of multi-year
memberships, forbidden by Union
rules. The letter does not challenge
this, but instead requests evidence
to show that current committee
members were involved. It is not
clear whether they were or not, but
there is prima facie evidence that
shows that multi-year member-
ships were sold.
Asked for comment, Union Presi-
dent, John Collins, responded:
“It would not be correct for me to
make a comment at this point. I
have forwarded the matter onto
the College’s lawyers for consid-
eration, due to time constraints.”
Jon Matthews and Eric Lai both re-
sponded that commenting would be
inappropriate. Miss Chow has been
invited to comment; no reply was
forthcoming.
Clubs have no individual, legal sta-
tus within the Union, which means
the upshot of any legal action on the
behalf of ICCS would be the rather
ridiculous state of the Union suing
itself.
Since this story was written, Miss
Chow and her mother, along with a
solicitorfromWong&Co,haveflown
to London to consult with their UK
solicitors. Mr Collins has received a
letter from a London firm confirm-
ing the deadline for reversal of the
suspension as September 28, and
threatening legal action should the
decision not be reversed by today.
