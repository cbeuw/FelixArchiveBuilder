ebration, which in true Sinfonietta
style went on throughout the night.
On our return to Prague, we per-
formed another concert with De-
bashish in the City Library Hall, this
time including Shostakovich’s “Fes-
tival Overture” in our programme.
Groups of eager Sinfonietta play-
ers armed with maps, tourist guides
and tram tickets embarked to inves-
tigate every corner of Prague over
the weekend. Witnessing England’s
departure from the World Cup on
giant screens erected in the square,
prompted many to be thankful that
Prague beer was so cheap.
Spirits were lifted by attending
the boasted “largest music club in
middle Europe” which was likened
by many to a multi-storey car park,

Are you interested in film? Do you
want to join a society where you can
watch interesting movies, discuss
them with like-minded people and
learn more about film-making?
Last year Filmsoc showed a wide
range of films, including Chung
King Express (directed by Wong
Kar Wai), Ichi the Killer (Takashi
Miike), Bande a Part (Jean Luc
Godard), Brazil (Terry Gilliam),
and Coffee and Cigarettes (Jim
Jarmusch). We also organised trips
to the Institut Français and the
Barbican.
This year, we start off on Octo-
ber 5 with the Lars von Triers film,
Breaking the Waves.
Breaking the Waves is influenced
by many of the ideas of the Dogme
film-making movement. The goal of
the Dogme movement was to purify
filmmaking by rejecting the use of
special effects and postproduction
gimmicks in order to focus more on
the story and the actors’ perform-
ances. Lars von Triers announced
the movement in 1995 along with
fellow Danish directors Thomas
Vinterberg, Kristian Levring and
Soren Kragh-Jacobsen. Specific
rules included that filming must
be done on location (i.e., without
the use of sets and props), sound
should be produced at the same
time as the images, the camera
must be hand-held, and the use of
special lighting and optical filters is
not allowed.
Over this term, we will also be
screening films from David Lynch,
Woody Allen and Fritz Lang and
will be organising a trip to the Lon-
don Film Festival.
We are a fairly new society and
we really welcome everyone who
shares our enthusiasm for cinema.

On Monday June 26, Prague Air-
port received more than 80 pasty-
faced Imperial College students,
still clinging protectively to their
instrument cases, whilst grappling
through luggage for sun cream and
shades. No amount of weeks bask-
ing in Hyde Park after exams had
prepared us for the glorious sun-
shine of Prague.
Impeccable travel instructions
and pocket Prague guides meant
that even collisions between trams
and JCBs couldn’t prevent us from
arriving intact, excited and enthu-
siastic to sample the delights the
Czech capital had to offer.
Next morning we were off again
to our next destination, the delight-
ful Spa town of Podêbrady. Unfortu-
nately the weather turned against
us and, despite soaring tempera-
tures, our first two concerts, meant
to be open air in the Castle gardens
of Lázeský park, were accompa-
nied by rain. Big Band, however,
admirably soldiered on through the
downpour, to one of our largest au-
diences of the tour, in a lunchtime
concert.
In our second concert, including
Mussorgsky’s “Night on the Bare
Mountain”, Shostakovich’s Sym-
phony No. 12 and Saint-Saëns’ “In-
troduction and Rondo Capriccioso”
we were joined by solo violinist
John Dickinson, an Imperial Col-
lege physics graduate. Impressed
by both our playing and “sense of
teamwork” the Mayor expressed
his gratitude and admiration for our
hard work by giving us an exclusive
tour of the town hall and presented
each of us with a gift. We were par-
ticularly delighted to discover that
this gift contained bottles of a so far
unidentified, intoxicating liquor.
Our final day in Podêbrady gave
us a great opportunity to visit the
castle and its beautiful gardens.
Excited by the apparent change in
weather we finally played outdoors,
on the specially built stage we had
hastily been forced to abandon
two nights previously. Attracting a
much larger attendance, under the
baton of acclaimed guest conduc-
tor Debashish Chaudhuri, we per-
formed Dvorák’s Symphony No. 9
to an appreciative Czech audience,
along with the Mussorgsky.
Later that evening, Jazz Big Band
played their wettest concert ever
beneath the less than adequate
protection of golfing umbrellas. De-
spite the rain, Sinfonietta danced
the night away to the sounds of
‘Franka Sinatry’ and local people
stopped to listen along the walls
overlooking the courtyard. Jazz
band’s unfaltering dedication, de-
spite being soaked through, was
incredible and worthy of great cel-
both in layout, interior design and
smell. A chamber music concert
in Vrtbovská gardens gave us all a
chance to relax amongst the beauti-
fully kept buildings and sculptures
overlooking the rooftops of Prague
whilst supporting our fellow musi-
cians in an imaginatively staged
concert of immense quality.
Pleased with the quality of all
ten concerts performed on tour
we joined together for a final meal.
Having finished the tour on such
a high I am sure no one will doubt
that it was a tremendous success. A
final thanks must go to our conduc-
tor Daniel Capps, as well as Alex
Novo Tellado and Tom Woodcock,
for their outstanding efforts to or-
ganise such a fantastic tour.
