INVESTMENT BANKING IS JUST ABOUT THE MOST EXCITING, DYNAMIC, CHALLENGING AND REWARDING
CAREER YOU CAN CHOOSE. IT IS LESS ABOUT MONEY, TRADING SCREENS AND SKYSCRAPERS, AND MUCH MORE
ABOUT THE POWER OF TEAMWORK AMONG TALENTED PEOPLE. SO, IF WE TURN UP AND DO THE
STANDARD PRESENTATION, WITH TALKING HEADS AND OBSCURE GRAPHS, WE’RE NOT REALLY DOING JUSTICE
TO THE OPPORTUNITY. INSTEAD, WE WOULD LIKE TO MEET WITH YOU, ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AND MAYBE
EXPLAIN WHAT GETS US OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING. WE TRUST YOU WON’T GET A BETTER OFFER.
