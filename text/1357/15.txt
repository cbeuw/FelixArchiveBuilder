Presenting in the main
room one of the hottest
production outfits of the
moment - Switch is in
everyone’s record box
right now. Their current
smash ‘A bit patchy’
which is forthcoming
on Dave Taylor’s own
imprint ‘Dubsided’ is
almost a classic sum-
mary of how Switch
deliver beats that liter-
ally (lift/tear?) the roof
off a dancefloor. Hav-
ing recently remixed the
likes of Martin Solveg and
X-Press 2, Switch have
just re-rubbed the all time
classic Basement Jaxx
- ‘Fly Life’ ready for it’s re-
release on Atlantic Jaxx.
It gets better. Hosting
the Terrace this month
is the Happy Mondays
Collective (messy) bust-
ing out a DJ-Set alongside
the Papadiso residents
Frisky DJ’s & Kiss FM’s
Steve Smart. In the Loft
Sub-Mission – a DJ col-
lective based in London
and the south-east, ded-
icated to the electronic
sounds of funky, deep,
tech and electro house
music go head to head
with Chocolate Groove
who at just over a year
old will be playing their
mix of Soulful, Deep, US
House/Funky, Chunky,
Jackin House (mixed
with a bit of electro &
disco-funk).
We’ve got 10 pairs of tickets for Papadiso and
Jaded at Egg club on the 14th October, featuring,
Happy Mondays, Switch DJ’s and Kiss100’s
Steve Smart.
Reintroducing a much
needed dash of glamour
and gorgeousness to
Friday night partying,
Stereo Sushi will lav-
ishly transform Ministry
into an opulent, orien-
tal playground com-
plete with Stereo hosts
and Sushi Ninja Girl
Warriors.
In the main room the
legendary CJ Mack-
instosh will grace the
turntables, dropping an
array of soulful, intoxicat-
ing rhythms – if there’s
one person who knows
how to work the mighty
main room it’s CJ – one
of the original Ministry of
Sound resident DJ’s from
back in day. Joining him
on the night is another of
London’s leading soulful-
house DJ’s – Glyne Brait-
waite, ready to deliver one
of his infamous deep and
anthem led sets.
Andy Norman and
Jamie Richard take
care of proceedings in
the Bar, taking us all on
a melodious journey,
satisfying our musical
needs with the finest
selection of deep and
dirty disco grooves. Soul
Logic host the Baby
Box, with additional
percussion supplied by
Shovell from M-People.
We’ve got guestlist for one winner and two
friends for StereoSushi at Ministry of Sound on
October 13, plus three Hed Kandi double CD albums
to give away (to the same people).
