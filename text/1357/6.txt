world stage.
From the researchers’ perspec-
tive, the ability for scientists to
think entrepreneurially encour-
ages them to think about their work
in the context of society. The critical
aspect of starting any new business
is finding a market, and to do so
requires a deep understanding of
what people want or need. In think-
ing commercially, scientists are get-
ting better at looking at their work
with the eyes of someone on the ex-
terior. The smaller the gap between
the laboratory and the shelves, the
less distant the scientific world will
seem to the general public, some-
thing which is vitally important in
recruiting the next generation of
researchers.
The ICE launch event featuring
one of the world’s leading entre-
preneurs will be held in the first
week of term and open to anyone
who would like to expand their ho-
rizons. It might be time well spent;
as Kasem says gleefully, “to suc-
ceed you’ll need more than just a
degree.”
The Imperial College Entrepre-
neurs will launch on 17th October
at 6.30 on the Lower Ground Floor
of the Tanaka Business School.
There will also be a ‘Breaking the
ICE’ session on 12th October for all
those interested in becoming mem-
bers or just finding out more.

ible, time-efficient manner through

The society aims to be as incor-
porating and interactive as possi-
ble. It is targeted at all members of
staff and students and they intend
to work closely with existing bodies
within the college such as Impe-
rial Innovations and the Venture
Capital Club. IC Entrepreneurs is
also looking outside the college to
create strong links with business
schools (such as the London Busi-
ness School) and companies within
the venture capital sector. Imperial
is ideally placed, both geographi-
cally and academically, to attract
major investors and already the
team have received significant in-
terest from the groups they have
approached.
This venture can only be a good
thing for the College. Although the
thorny issue of the sharing of intel-
lectual property between research-
ers and their institutions is still a
hot topic, it is evident that univer-
sity spin-offs can provide enormous
benefits to both parties. As univer-
sities gain experience and knowl-
edge in the world of commerce,
they are learning how to retain a
greater chunk of the financial fruits
of their research. As seen in the US,
this money can be used to strength-
en the university’s standing on the
Innovation Creation
A new society aims to stir up the entrepreneurial spirit within the College. Toby Ferenczi speaks to the
co-founders Sefian Kasem, Ross Richardson, Bobby Goulding and Shin Yang Cheung
“There is only one way to make a
great deal of money; and that is in a
business of your own,” announced
J. Paul Getty, former oil tycoon and
one-time richest man in America. It
is this realisation that has seen en-
trepreneurial activity grow drasti-
cally over the past three decades.
For people with ambition, building
one’s own business has become the
ultimate achievement. With only
one in ten new businesses succeed-
ing it is not for the faint hearted, but
for those with the drive and vision
to spot a potential venture, the re-
wards could not be greater. As more
prospective Richard Bransons join
the fray, the hunt for ‘opportunity’
grows ever more difficult, and since
the essence of science is innovation,
this has led to a strong link between
science and entrepreneurship.
Ivy League universities in the
US took advantage of this situation
from an early stage, building net-
works of investors and their aca-
demic staff. This has been a major
factor in the success of both US uni-
versities and the US economy. Cre-
ating a new enterprise is perhaps
the purest form of productivity
and, as such, entrepreneurship has
been a huge driver of industry over
recent years. Although initially be-
hind, UK universities are gradually
catching up with their transatlantic
counterparts. IC Entrepreneurs, a
new society this year, aims to propel
Imperial College to the forefront of
technological venture.
“We are dedicated to providing
the highest quality of resources to
foster the spirit of entrepreneurship
and innovation across campus,”
says Sefian Kasem, former Finance
Society president and IC Entrepre-
neurs’ co-founder. Through a se-
ries of hands-on interactive events
they aim to introduce the theory
of entrepreneurship and highlight
the practical skills required by
entrepreneurs. “We want to simu-
late real situations so people can
get involved, instead of just listen-
ing to lectures,” Ross Richardson
explains. Games such as ‘Dating
with Dragons’ sound intriguing,
although he reminds me that they
are designed primarily to improve
one’s business skills rather than
love life.
These activities will be comple-
mented by networking sessions;
events that, in the founders’ words,
“bring people interested in entre-
preneurship together in a harmo-
nious, supportive environment to
encourage the cross-pollination of
ideas and the expansion of contact
networks.” Members will also be
“We are
dedicated
to fostering
the spirit of
entrepreneurship
and innovation
across campus”

Ceres Power
Founded in 2001 by Professors
Nigel Brandon, John Kilner, Alan
Atkinson, and the late Brian
Steele, Ceres Power has devel-
oped unique ‘solid oxide’ fuel
cells that operate at much lower
temperatures, allowing the cells
to be made more cheaply. Win-
ners of the Carbon Trust Low
Carbon Innovation Award in
2003, they have won numerous
awards, received praise from
the Prime Minister as a “world
leader” in fuel cell technology,
and secured contracts with Brit-
ish Gas, along with other large
companies in the energy sector.
Concrete Canvas
Founded by two students from
the Industrial Design Engineer-
ing course, William Crawford
and Peter Brewin, who have
developed a rapidly deployable
hardened shelter for people
made homeless during natural
or man-made disasters. The
“building in a bag” is a sack
of cement-impregnated fabric
that can be inflated to produce
a structure that is more dura-
ble than a tent, but lighter and
more readily transported than a
Portakabin or similar temporary
building. They have received
nine awards, including the
Saatchi & Saatchi Award for
World-Changing Ideas, as well
as raising over £40,000 in fund-
ing for their prototypes.
Delta Dot
Founded in 2000 by Dr John
Hassard and based on work on
the separation and analysis of
biomolecules pioneered in the
High Energy Physics Group at
the College, their technique of
“DNA vertexing” can read long
sequences of DNA in a frac-
tion of the time conventional
sequencing systems take, with
a very low cost per base pair.
Their approach to protein
analysis replaces the 2D gel
electrophoresis with a faster and
more accurate chip-based sys-
tem. These new methods have
improved sensitivity and resolu-
tion compared to the traditional
processes at much lower cost.
In all, they have received over
£1.5m from investor funding.
