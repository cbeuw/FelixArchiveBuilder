O2 Wireless Festival
Hyde Park
Sunday June 25
★★★★✩
Much was said in the build-up to
this album’s release; speculation
was endless as to what Muse could
do next. The band were quoted as
saying they had been inspired by
The Strokes and their sense of mel-
ody. Some fans were worried that
the band would lose their identity
and ‘sell-out’ to the stereotypical
mainstream indie crowd, but this
was not to be the case. While this
album may be more accessible to
the mainstream listener the band
have most certainly not lost any of
their edge. If anything, this album
proves them to be the true innova-
tors they have only hinted at being
in the past.
Their last album, Absolution, re-
leased to critical acclaim and com-
mercial success, carried a central
theme of apocalyptic events and
conspiracy theories. Instead of con-
tinuing this trend and making Abso-
lution Mk II, as many lesser bands
would have, the band have used ele-
ments from their earlier sound and
taken them to a new level.
As the first single, Supermas-
sive Black Hole has proven, the
band are not afraid of experiment-
ing with their sound, but they took
great risks in doing so. By chang-
ing their sound so completely to
this new disco-funk inspired style

★★★★✩
I think that what I am about to say
will you give some idea as to how
I feel about this band. If you have
not heard Gogol Bordello’s latest
album Gypsy Punks: Underdog
World Strike, go and buy it now and
enjoy. Tired of listening to endless
indie-pop bands, which it seems are
becoming increasingly blander as
more and more hat-wearing, pointy
shoe, skinny jean wearing bands
shoot to stardom? Then this bizarre
fusion of gypsy folk and punk is the
perfect antidote.
The music snobs amongst you
may dismiss them as a cheap gim-
mick with silly songs, however you
can’t argue with the reaction of
the crowd when you see them live.
Their credibility is further boosted
by the fact that this is their fifth al-
bum, with their first in 1999, and the
fact that they have featured on the
U.S. Warped Tour. Their songs may
seem nonsensical, reflected in song
titles such as Start Wearing Purple
and Immigrant Punk. However if
you can listen to this album with-
out making slightly strange move-
ments in time to any of the songs,
then there is something wrong with
you. This music is so refreshing
and unusual; the frantic playing of
the fiddle and accordion used in so
many of their songs adds to the ex-
citement and chaos created by the
crazy lyrics and piercing, intermit-
tent shrieks.
Their unique sound can be at-
tributed to Gogol Bordello being
largely made up of Eastern-Euro-
pean immigrants, now based and
living in New York. Their influences
are accredited to a wide range of
bands, most of which I’m not afraid
to say, I have never heard of, as I
am evidently not an alternative/ob-
scure music-buff. However, I would
recommend this album to abso-
lutely anybody who likes listening
to haphazard, vibrant and revital-
izing music. A far cry from what the
British music scene is threatening
to become.

Most people’s first taste of The Au-
tomatic would probably have been
with their hugely successful single
Monster. This was mine anyway,
and if I’m being honest I enjoyed
the rather fun, catchy and shouty
nature of the song, accompanied by
an entertainingly comical video, of
you guessed it, them being chased
by a monster. However, the novelty
of the raspy shouts repeating the
end of every line becomes incred-
ibly irritating, when you realise that
somebody, somewhere decided that
it would be a good idea to use this
technique on virtually every song
on The Automatic’s debut album
Not Accepted Anywhere.
Don’t get me wrong, I do actu-
ally like this welsh band and I en-
joy what they are trying to do. My
favourite track is Lost at Home
simply because they have refrained
from using any shouty-sections, al-
though admittedly I was just wait-
ing for them to be introduced. Their
other tracks which have been re-
leased as singles are also included
on this album. Raoul and Recover,
which has been re-released after its
limited success as their first ever
single have both received moderate
success however obviously Monster
was what got The Automatic their
big break. These tracks along with
Monster are very catchy, possibly
explaining the excessive amounts
the band risked losing their main
fanbase, who knew and loved them
for their harder space-rock work.
At first many fans, myself included,
were bemused by this direction but
although it is a radical departure it
is also completely brilliant and tre-
mendous fun.
Much of the rest of the album
follows suit and yet it is still much
more varied than their other ones.
Stand out tracks include Map of the
Problematique which combines a
throbbing beat and pulsating gui-
tars with emotional, heartfelt lyrics
like, ‘Why can’t we see, when we
bleed we bleed the same’. Another
highlight is the politically charged
Assassin which kicks into action
with crushing guitars and thrash-
ing drums while encouraging a rev-
olution with Bellamy’s lyrics, ‘Aim,
shoot, kill your leaders’.
Overall the album is a much eas-
ier listen than previous efforts and
the diversity of the songs ensure
that the listener is never bored.
The album is closed by the epic
Knights of Cydonia which romps
and riffs its way through six min-
utes of pomp and spectacle before
burning out. At the end you are left
with one hell of a catchy riff stuck
in your head, and an impression of
slight disorientation. Like an im-
pressive and varied fireworks dis-
play that goes out with that big loud
one leaving your ears ringing and
your retinas scarred, this album
is great fun and as long as it’s not
taken too seriously a superb album
all round.

of radioplay that this band receives.
The band do produce interesting,
and somewhat refreshing songs,
however they are all so similar that
when combined they form an al-
bum that at best can be described
as mediocre.
Apparently the band is called The
Automatic as they provide the per-
fect cure to the automatic, monoto-
nous lives that far too many people
lead. However, surely if you just re-
place one repetitive task with a te-
diously droning noise of an album,
you get that same bored feeling and
that is exactly what The Automatic
have achieved. Individually the
songs are quite good, but they seem
to be limited resulting in an album
that sounds all too similar.

festival review
The final day of this year’s O2 wire-
less festival opens with a set from
OK Go. With ‘get, get, get over it’
inevitably fixed in our heads like
a piece of barbed cheese, we won-
der around for more sounds. We
find London’s own New Young
Pony Club (formerly NYPC), who
start their set with The Get Go, the
jumped up punk-funk brings life
into this Sunday afternoon.
The quirky front woman, Tahita,
is relaxed and charming, banter-
ing with the audience, and betting
that we can’t help but dance to the
Jamaican reggae groove of Hiding
on the Staircase. She has a point.
The crowd know how to embrace
variety.
After a bit of a wander around,
we come back to the X Stage to find
New York’s Matisyahu (Matthew
Paul Miller), bounding around the
stage to push some Hasidic Jew-
ish reggae into our ears. Looking at
ease as the crowd builds to follow
the hype that forms a fog around
him. You just want to sway to the
beat-boxing dubbed up Rasta roots
sound.
Sunday sunshine doesn’t provide
the purring intimacy that Alison
Goldfrapp demands. We only catch
two Goldfrapp Songs, but we’re bid-
ing time as Gang of Four are due to
headline the Xfm Stage so we move
swiftly on. The X Stage is barely half
full as some punters have twigged
that Niteversions are another in-
carnation of Soulwax. Their set of
dancebeats crafted out of percus-
sion and knob twiddling just builds
the rhythm of our anticipation. As
they finish the audience melts away.
Are these people stupid? Or are we
at the wrong stage? A band formed
in ’77 that smashed up a sold out
Brixton Academy in 2004 and now
there’s 30 of us in this crowd. Their
loss is our gain. We move in closer
and amazingly, we're at the front.
They don’t disappoint. Gill leaps
ontothestagefirstprancingaround
like a sprite, King’s bashing his
percussion instrument of choice,
a microwave, with a baseball bat.
Here’s the intensity of sound we’ve
waited for, what some have called
their neo-Marxist funk. Call it what
you want, it was a set of classics.
Clearly enjoying themselves and it
rubs off on the crowd.
We are moved beyond words and
all we can do to pogo uncontrolla-
bly and grin. Their set is the high-
light of the day. As Gang of Four
come off-stage, we rush over to the
main stage for headliners, Depeche
Mode.
The crowd has significantly ex-
panded since we left Goldfrapp's
set. We are barely settled and the
tallest man in the vicinity positions
himself directly in front of us. His
mate, probably the second tallest
man in the whole crowd, stands
next to him. That was very consid-
erate we thought before shifting
behind some normal sized people.
They’re playing all the hits flaw-
lessly and we wonder why it doesn’t
feel like the headlining act of one of
our favourite bands.
Suddenly everything changes.
Here comes Personal Jesus. The
sun starts to set, the huge screens
shine out beautiful pictures and
from nowhere, the atmosphere fi-
nally arrives. Now it feels like the
headline set of a festival.
When Dave Gahan utters the
words,‘Come on lets see those
hands,’ the crowd obeys. They
played the hits, but these were
the songs that we needed to hear:
Stripped; Personal Jesus; I Feel
You and finishing on Never Let Me
Down Again. A draining yet exhila-
rating end to the day, we faithfully
went and bought Depeche Mode
T-shirts.
