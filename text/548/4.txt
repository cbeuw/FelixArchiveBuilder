Wake up an Hour Early
Having emerged from her lair deep in the heart
of Falmouth Hall early this coming Sunday
(Complete with clean hair) the noble Blott will be
bringing you the 'breakfast' show. Reflect a
moment, mere mortals, on the fact that we will
have lost an hour the night before so the program
will really be starting at 7:00.
Now that the gremlins seem to have been
banished it is with much pride and use of
superlatives that this term's final 'Wake up with
Sarah' can be unveiled. With a scintillating
mixture of current singles (both scure and
obscure), old things (Simon Milner?) and recent
album music, this has to be the most wide-awake
show available on your tranny at that time of the
morning.
So show that you care and make a little girl very
happy by tuning-in any time between 8:00 and
11:00, (i.e. 7:00 - 10:00??!).
Thora Balast.
Would you like to make this little girl very happy?

iTHE G R E A T IMPERIAL R A G R A C E : C H A P T E R 2!
I am writing with reference to the Arsey
Ess propaganda that appeared in FELIX
last week entitled " T h e Great Imperial
Rag Race". I think it is desirable to warn
the perpetrators of this diabolical injustice'
that though they are undeniably bionic,
nay superhuman, they are not Guildsmen.
Those Guildsmen who were deemed fit
for the task and known as the Immortal Few
(of "Never before have so many been sold
by so few" and "Last Rag Mag in Paris"
fame) were none less than those jolly bands
of Chemical Engineers and the infamous
BE1.
With all due modesty (ie none), I shall
attempt to chronicle some of the feats of
these Guildsmen which far outshine the
miserable achievements of those specimens
of humanity k n o w n as T H E M T H A T
W H I M S (anag) a n d H U G V E S T IN
C H E S T (anag).
T o begin with we have Jon "Livingston I
pressume" Stanley who sold approximately
two hundred and thirty mags and also did
some work the same weekend. Along
with that other triumph of our creatory
imagination F r a n k Rowsell, he even
discovered half of the famous Bristol
Union Long Bar.
Two other stalwarts of ingenuity, Tony
Heales and Chris Spotty Davies, both of
B E 1 , surely merit mention for putting
duty before their own pesonal safety by
venturing into a decrepit specimen of a
F o r d a n d p r o c e e d i n g at high speed
t h r o u g h c e n t r a l L o n d o n u n d e r the
incapable c o n t r o l of Ian C r y o r (ten
previous convictions). Further evidence of
this dedication to duty and sense of fair
play is born witness by the fact that Tony
persisted in selling Rag Mags rather than
his body whilst at a Barts Hospital Nurses
Disco!
Last but not least we have the saga of
the "nameless G u i l d s m a n " who shall
remain nameless. Travelling under the
pseudonym of Deviant (I do it my way)
this hero of modern times travelled over
eight hundred miles that weekend with Â£7
in his pocket and the public's sympathy
for his transport. Deviant eventually
e s c a p e d from the initial R C S c o c k -
everything-up at 2:30pm and was coerced
into accepting a lift to Knutsford services.
After indulging in deep fried eggs and
chips he reached Fortran services from
whence a capitalist whisked our unfortunate
lad to Edinburgh. Our hero listened to the
tales of Rolls'Royces and twenty-nine
nightclubs and nine firms which the man
owned whilst resisting the vice of envy.
After hitting a brick at 70mph on the A74
which wrecked a wheel, Deviant arrived
in Edinburgh at 12:30am. He was told
"the Forth Road Bridge is that way" and
started walking. Five hours later having
walked fifteen miles and been molested
twice by smokey bears, he arived at the
bridge.
Cold, tired and hungry, he got a lift
with an unintelligible Scot who deposited
him on a roundabout which was nowhere
except vertically above the M90. A n hour
passed a n d Deviant was taken by a
tarmac van to nowhere else from where
he got a bus to Perth. He obtained proof
of purchase and attempted to hitch to
E d i n b u r g h , but S c o t t i s h g e n e r o s i t y
prevailed and he had to catch the train.
From Edinburgh Deviant was taken, as
if by magic to Leeds, sharing the back
seat with two Yorkshire lasses. He was
rested and watered at a Tetleys pub
before being put on a bus to Leeds city
centre. Deviant paid his fare, sat down
and fell asleep. H e woke up an equal
distance the other side of Leeds and
decided to try again. Eventually he found
refuge and went to sleep. The next day
he sold Rag mags for four hours then got
a lift to Watford Gap. The poor innocent
lad had just stepped from this car when
he was carried off into the bowels of an
A u d i by a n aging lady d o c t o r w h o
brought him to Princes Gardens, this is
known as door to door service.
It gives me great pleasure, sir, to
r e m a i n y o u r m o s t h o n o u r a b l e a n d
o b e d i e n t s e r v a n t . T h e A n o n y m o u s
G u i l d s m a n , otherwise known as D O
G A I N N O S H of BE1. Thanks to Y E S
V E T T H E M L E N of E E l for the anagrams.
