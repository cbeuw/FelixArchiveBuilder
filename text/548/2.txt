Dear Sir
I would just like to say, through
your columns, a huge thank you
to everyone who helped me with,
encouraged me with, and laugh-
ed at my election campaign.
T H A N K S E V E R Y O N E . You
still have my heart.

Dear Colin
We think it is time everyone
was made aware of the issues
concerning this week's edition
of Forward.
Forward was banned last
Monday by the elections com-
mittee on the basis of unfair
c o m m e n t o n the sabbatical
elections. C o m m e n t on the
F E L I X elections was deleted
before publication, following
protests from some of the
candidates. We freely admit
that there are justifiable critic-
isms that can be made; notably
that we attempted to distribute
Forward on the morning of the
elections. Also, we should have
asked the candidates about their
ideas more fully. We apologise if'
any candidate feels they were
unfairly treated; our intention
was to p r o v i d e an honest
election commentary.
H o w e v e r , we a b s o l u t e l y
defend our right to comment on
Union elections in a fair manner.
It is the right of any club or
individual to voice considered
opinions and stimulate thought
and discussion. As a political
club it is our role to present ideas
on local as well as national issues.
It is important that alternative
voices exist to complement
official Union publications. We
would resist most strongly any
attempts to suppress indepen-
dant publications, as an attack
on open debate and discussion.
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
In reply to Lee Paddon's
letter in FELIX (Issue no 547), I
sincerely hope that another
opportunity to discuss the Boat
Club tour to South Africa will
not arise. Surely it is just this
attitude of 'flogging a dead
horse' that makes Union meet-
ings, boring, repetitive and
therefore poorly attended. I
would have thought it had
penetrated the minds of most
'motion proposers' that students
at IC are bored to their back
teeth with the same motions
appearing with m o n o t o n o u s
regularity, I certainly am.
Yours sincerely

With regard to the qualities
r e q u i r e d for l e a d e r s h i p in
industry, I think it could be
argued that academic superiority
is irrelevant. So I do not see a
future 'entrance requirement'
that any lecturer must be able to
lead a dustmen's strike — not
that I am suggesting that any of
the academic staff could not save
Leyland at a moments notice.
I would (respectfully) suggest
that Professor Brown should
take more notice of the current
academic structure of Guilds.
We already have four classes in
Mechanical Engineering: Four
year course, Total Technology,
Joint Honours, and Ordinary
Honours.
I would also suggest that the
death of FELIX cartoons has
been made up for the printing
errors. What a 'bookship' is
(John Tidy's manifesto) I'm not
sure, but I can see how appro-
priate it is forDramsoc's farce to
mention 'police farces'. I agree
that the playwright is not well-
known in Britian.
Who wrote the ICWA sweat-
shirt ad? It struck me as being
crude and sexist.
In the article 'How T o Vote'
our Hon Sec states that sabbat-
icals "represent you, not them-
selves. I feel that in practice, this
is not true. Roger Stotesbury
told me last week that he did not
care about the image of Imperial
College. For the eighty percent
(approximately) of IC students
who live out, and dare I say it — I
certainly do — the 86% of
students who are male, going to
social events at other colleges is
often more interesting, more
convenient, or both, than going
to IC dos. Imperial doesn't own
us, and we know it. Yet our
reception at other colleges, etc,
is tarnished by IC's reputation,
which in turn puts off students
(etc) elsewhere from coming to
IC events.
Yours faithfully

Dear Colin
O n the back page of FELIX,
last week, there was an article,
outling plans to excavate gravel
at Harlington. Whilst agreeing
with m u c h of what is said,
there are h o w e v e r several
questions that I would like to
ask: Why has this issue come
to light now? (who approached
whom and for what purpose?);
What would a £'/2 million
sports centre extension consist
of?; Could that money be put
to better use?
I would challenge the assertion
that "the only inconvenience to
College and students would be
the loss of some pitches." I would
also criticise the vagueness with
respect to the royalty expected.
My slide rule tells me that the
difference between a 35p/tonne
royalty and a 60p/tonne royalty
would be a substantial £357,000.
A start-to-finish timescale of four
years I regard with scepticism.
I would be very pleased if
Roger Stotesbury, or anybody,
could answer these questions.
Yours sincerely

Sir
T h a n k you for explaining
that I am not a sabbatical
candidate.
I was, however, most upset
that you omitted to print the
manifesto for a presidential
candidate (fully proposed and
seconded) that I penned.
Whilst on the subject of
elections I can assure you that
the Coca-Cola trick does not
work. However, dipping one's
union card into E S B has the
effect of partially melting the
plastic covering thus sealing
any small circular holes which
it may bear. The name also
becomes barely readable owing
to a frosting effect on the
plastic. By this method I have
found if possible to vote several
times. After this I couldn't
actually find my way out of
Stan's bar, otherwise I am sure
I could have continued indefin-
itely.
Is this sufficient grounds to
hold a new election, to be
monitored by an internationally
agreed peace-keeping body?
(This time I am considering
standing for a post myself.)
Yours
Ravel
