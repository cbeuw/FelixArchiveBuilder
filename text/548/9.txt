C O N C E R T
Conductor: Richard Dickens
Leader: David Bogle
Soloist: Colin Bradbury
It's not often that IC's Music Society
presents a soloist as distinguished as Colin
Bradbury, the principal clarinettist of the BBC
Symphony Orchestra. Many times your
reviewer has heard Mr Bradbury as soloist with
that orchestra, although at several times the
cost of this concert. It is a pity that so few IC
students turned up to hear this very enjoyable
performance, albeit in the inadequate acoustics
of the Great Hall, in fact no more than to a
typical Ents concert.
The evening began with a performance of
Sibelius' suite "Karelia", unfortunately, not too
well. The string writing in particular of the first
movement is rather tricky, not to say athletic,
and the players tackled the second movement
more happily. As one of Sibelius' professors is
supposed to have said to a collegue: "If you'd
spent half your life up to your neck in snow,
you'd write stuff like that too."
- Once the initial suggestions of television
current affairs programmes are over, the
Karelia suite, and especially the second
movement, actually suggests the snow covered
landscapes of northern Scandinavia. By the
third movement, which is the liveliest, the
orchestra had 'warmed up', and the brass
section made the most of their moments of
glory.
Probably the most interesting part of the
programme was the concerto, written at the
turn of the century by Stanford, who later
became professor of composition at the place
between Mines and Aero Eng. His name is
better known as a teacher of a more successful
generation of British composers, than for his
own music. Neither this early concerto for
clarinet nor those for piano are often
performed.
The ICSO responded to Colin Bradbury's
participation by playing their best. The
concerto is reminiscent of Brahms, in manv
places, but even a confirmed Wagnerite such
as myself couldn't hold that against such a
pleasant work. The influence of Brahms is
clearest in the slow movement, where the
strings recede to the background, behind
concertante woodwind. The only concerto of
its generation to which I could turn for a
comparison was that of Nielsen, indeed I recall
a performance of this concerto by the same
soloist several years ago. The solo clarinet part
in Stanford's concerto is much less energetic,
without cadenzas as such, but becomes quite
lively in the final movement. The composer
was born in Dublin, and his music is much
influenced by Irish folk music (eg, his five "Irish
Rhapsodies"); so this finale does for the jig
what Richard Strauss and Liszt did for the
waltz, or Malcolm Arnold for the Scots reel.
The listener could almost imagine a Ceilidh
with the clarinet substituted for fiddle,
becoming wilder and wilder as the night went
by.
After the interval, revitalised by coffee, we
returned to hear the " G r e a t C-Major"
symphony by Schubert. The programme got
his dates wrong twice; Schubert in fact died in
1828 at the early age of thirty-one, and it was a
tragedy for music that his life was so brief. In
that time he produced not only nine symphonies
and other orchestral music, but also about a
thousand songs, many of which are still top of the
classical pops.
Although this symphony tries too hard for
the grand manner that Brucker could later
achieve so easily, like all of Schubert's music, it
succeeds because of its tunes, even if the main
theme of the last movement is suspiciously
similar to that of another ninth symphony. IC
Orchestra put the tunes over beautifully, and
also managed the tricky bits. Perhaps the
pianissimos could have been a little bit more
so, but otherwise Schubert was treated very
fairly. In the last movement the pace was kept
up right to the end, even though the 'railway
• train' accompaniment is quite boring (as well as
tiring) for the strings.
Next term's concert features the Grieg
concerto, and the outdoor 1812 Overture
from the Wind Ensemble is also next term.
