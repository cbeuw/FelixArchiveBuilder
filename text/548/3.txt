Last Saturday saw fifty deaf children,
together with their parents a n d teachers,
descending o n Princes Gardens for the
C a b e r T o s s i n g E v e n t . A f t e r a s l i g h t l y
chaotic beginning, when it started to rain
just a s e v e r y o n e w a s a r r i v i n g , w e
managed to transfer to Southside Senior
Dining R o o m a n d thus keep fairly d r y .
While the kids r a n underneath, we
had a short presentation ceremony, giving
an a u d i t o r y t r a i n i n g unit t o t w o deaf
brothers, A d a m a n d Benjamin Pike, aged
seven and four. These boys were mentioned
in the TV Times last week, and we're hoping
for a follow-up story, so watch for it about
the beginning of April. I was then presented
with a certificate from the National Deaf
C h i l d r e n s S o c i e t y f o r " o u t s t a n d i n g
contributions to the welfare, development
and happiness of deaf children" so everyone
who's ever done anything for Rag take note
— you are appreciated.
This Tuesday saw the Guilds Election
U G M in ME220 with about five hundred
people there, making it the best attended
U G M t h i s y e a r . T h e r e w a s a n E G M
immediately before the meeting at which
the second reading of the constitutional
changes t o o k place, they were passed
and consequently the elections took place
u s i n g a different s y s t e m to that u s e d
before. T h e voting this time was by paper
ballot with stand-downs only in the t o p
three posts. T h e results were:

PRESIDENT
Congratulations to all those w h o w o n
and commiserations to those w h o didn't
s u c c e e d . T h e c e l e b r a t i o n s a f t e r w a r d s
followed their usual form with the n e w
Exec being thrown into the pool closely
followed by the o l d Exec w h o by n o w
were getting used to water. The customary
drinks in the Queens followed with the
President elect's round costing quite a bit.
L u n c h i n S t r i k e s w a s u n f o r t u n a t e l y
missed when''the waiter decided he was
not amused by Pat eating all the relish
before being served with his hamburger.
A change of venue followed with a mass
exodus from Strikes. T h e celebrations in
the evening were conducted in the Loose
B o x near Harrods where many bottles of
wine were drunk as were a few of the
people attending.
The afternoon continued with the caber-
tossing, which was superbly organised b y
t w o g u e s t s : S c o t t i s h c a b e r - t o s s e r s ,
complete with kilts and sporrans! After that
came lots of silly games a n d then t e a ,
complete with sausages o n sticks, jelly a n d
ice cream.
All in all it was a great afternoon w h i c h
everyone enjoyed, especially the children,
who as one happy parent said "they're
thrilled, they'll never forget it". A l s o dozens
of parents, teachers a n d officials of the
N D C S showered us with praise afterwards,
both for our fund-raising and the event itself.
In the words of their C h a i r m a n : " Y o u r
students are absolutely wonderful!"
I agree, and I'd like to thank everyone w h o
helped in any way, especially the 'new faces'
that turned u p — I hope you'll continue to
take a n interest.
A s p e c i a l m e n t i o n m u s t g o to K a t y
Tatchell for organising the food for s u c h a
m u l t i t u d e . I h a v e n ' t g o t r o o m t o list
everyone else, but thanks all the same,
especially for joining in the games a n d
getting o n so well with the kids. I hope
meeting them made your involvement as
worthwhile for you as it did for me.
