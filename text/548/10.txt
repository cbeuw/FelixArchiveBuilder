IMPERIAL COLLEGE LAWN
TENNIS CLUB
T h e I C T C has the use of eight
tennis courts, two hard courts behind
L i n s t e a d a n d six g r a s s c o u r t s at
H a r i i n g t o n . O b v i o u s l y , the g r a s s
courts are subject to the weather, and
as such, they are not available to play
on until the summer term.
On joining the Tennis Club (sub-
scription Â£1 paid to the Treasurer) all
the courts are available to play on. A
booking system, with sheets up on the
T e n n i s C l u b B o a r d in the S p o r t s
C e n t r e , is o p e r a t e d t h r o u g h o u t the
year for the hard courts.
The Tennis Club runs both mens
and ladies teams during the summer
term. The opposition is mainly other
London colleges and local clubs.
If you would like to be considered
for one of the teams, can you please
contact Simon Middleboe, Civ Eng 3
as soon as possible.
A practice will be held on the first
Wednesday of next term, with our first
match on the following Saturday. In
view of the weather and the danger of
losing that practice, the club officers
will be o n the L i n s t e a d c o u r t s o n
W e d n e s d a y 19th M a r c h at a r o u n d
2:00pm in o r d e r to see the relative
standards of those interested. C o m e
along it you want to make an impact.

TABLE TENNIS
Hi folks! It's me a g a i n ! O r rather it
isn't, in fact, it's someone completely
d i f f e r e n t . I m u s t write this w e e k ' s
report rapidly as Captain Beaky is hot
on my trail.
IC1 vs Exiles: 7-2
Another good result as the first team
march on towards the fourth division
c h a m p i o n s h i p . A rare p e r f o r m a n c e
here from Kumar (I'm not overweight
really) Singarajah and Khartik (I really
am overweight) Lakhani.
IC1 vs Hong Kong Students: 5-4
A poorer result than expected, but the
firsts still going well.
IC2 vs INCO: 1-8
A pity, this r e s u l t , in view ot the
second team's recent good form. A
T y e w i n n i n g the solitary set (some
insult about A Tye would have been
inserted here, but he was threatening
me with a Mooney).
IC2 vs NALGO: 4-5
A good result for the seconds against
the third placed team. Bob Edde doing
wel to win two of his three sets.
IC3 vs EC & FS MAN: 4-5
Disaster! T h e thirds lose their first
league match of the season to one of
the weaker teams in their division. The
thirds display showed about as much
life as a school of Japanese dolphins.
I R e e d was p a r t i c u l a r l y weak, his
feeble thrashings resembling the death
throes of an arthritic earthworm
It should be pointed out here that
the resemblance between A Cowling
and a chimpanzee is purely coincidental
vicious rumours that his mother was
G u y the gorilla are completely without
foundation, G u y was his father.
IC3 vs MARKS & SPARKS: 7-2
A makeshift team including a fourth
team player and Kit Nair, playing his
first league g a m e , a c h i e v e d a g o o d
victory over the fourth placed team.
IC4 vs TWA: 7-2
O n l y a d a z z l i n g d i s p l a y by P e t e
Hewkin, who lost two sets, prevented
the fourths from demonstrating that
they really are as good as the third
team.
ANNOUNCEMENT!
The Table Tennis Club A G M will be
held on W e d n e s d a y 19th M a r c h at
2:00pm in the Table Tennis Room. All
members are invited to attend and are

enough to want to be club president,
etc, next year, they should put their
names down with one proposer and
two seconders by this date.
Must slither now,

IC SAILING
T h e team travelled to B r a d f o r d this

league was held in which IC started
off w e l l w i n n i n g t h e i r first t h r e e
m a t c h e s . T h e i r first d e f e a t c a m e
against Edinburgh, who went on to
win the Barrel. The team finished third
o v e r a l l , but h a d the s e c o n d b e s t
points, loosing only three races.
Team: Ian Robson, John Williams,

LINSTEAD UNBEATEN
Last S u n d a y , at a b o u t 1:00pm a
s l i g h t l y i n e b r i a t e d L i n s t e a d t e a m
staggered to Hyde Park to find the
m a s s e d h o r d e s of F a l m o u t h H a l l
facing them.
Undaunted by this, and the lack of
sleep, Linstead took a two goal lead
t h r o u g h the work of M a r k F u l l e r .
Unfortunately one of Mark's shots hit
Adam and so that goal goes down to
h i m . F a l m o u t h were t h e n g i v e n a
dubious free kick on the edge of the
penalty area. This was tapped to J o h n
who scored.
T h e i r c a p t a i n , H a r r y , t h e n - s c o r e d
and also the other John, again with a
good shot from the outside of the box.
S o o n after h a l f t i m e , L i n s t e a d
s c o r e d twice, Mark s c o r i n g both to
complete his hat trick. Linstead held
out until five minutes from the end
w h e n a l o n g t h r o w r e s u l t e d in a
h e a d e r f r o m Kev g o i n g in off the
infamous Pat C h o w n .
The final score of four apiece was
fair and keeps up Linstead's unbeaten
r e c o r d u n e r t h e i r c a p t a i n , D a v e
Forshaw. Both teams played cleanly
a n d the g a m e was e n j o y e d (?) by
s e v e r a l s u p p o r t e r s . T h a n k s to the
timekeeper, Dana, from Falmouth.

Linstead: Phil, Dave, Nige, Phil, Dave

last, but by now means least, A d a m .
F a l m o u t h : Lito, B a l , A l D o o g , Kev,
John, John, Neil, Harry, Mike and Neil.
Also, a big thank you for the sup-
porters of both teams.
UNIVERSITY OF LONDON CUP
FINAL
IC 4ths vs LSE 2nds
FREE COACHES TO THE
GROUND
Forget Wembley! This year's football
action is at Motspur Park, tomorrow,
Saturday 15th March. Giant Killers IC
fourths take on the ham-fisted pros of
L S E in the first great battle of the 1980s.
P r o g r e s s to this final has b e e n as
inevitable as it's been spectacular. T h e
first to fall were R C H thirds by four goals
to nil, quickly followed by Goldsmith's
t h i r d s 6-1, a p r e c u r s o r to g r e a t e r
victories and scorelines. The quarter
final showed our real character when we
defeated the optimistic and determined
Q M C thirds by three goals to two in a
fast and bruising match. The semi-finals
gave the only 'hick-up' when after extra
time we drew one all with K C H seconds
d e s p i t e o u r a p p a r e n t s u p e r i o r i t y .
However,' the next week still sickened
and annoyed by our earlier performance
we smashed them eight goals to nil in a
furious blitzkrieg of attacking football.
Five games, twenty-two goals for, five
against, c a n s u c h entertainment be
missed? Be there and support your
College and help make it a great day.
Free coaches leave from outside the
U n i o n at n i n e thirty o n S a t u r d a y
morning. Kick Off is at eleven, so you'll
be in time to watch thetrugby if you want
to.
