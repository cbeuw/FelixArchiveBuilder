JEWS IN THE USSR
T H E C U R R E N T SITUATION
The situation of Soviet Jewry during 1979 markedly
deteriorated in several areas. This was reflected in the figures
for emigration which reveal that more Jews applied for exit
visas than in any previous year, whilst in consequence, there
was an increase in the number of emigrants — approximately
55,000 Jews left the USSR in 1979 — there was a
proportionately large increase in the number of refusals. In
Leningrad, for example, there are between 400-500 refusenik
families at present, as opposed to 150 this time last year. In
Moscow the number is far higher.
The Soviet authorities are making it more difficult to
receive an exit visa by steadily increasing restrictions of one
sort or another. The latest 'reason' for refusing to grant
permission to emigrate is that the applicant has no close
relatives in Israel. The difficulties facing applicants are
particularly acute in the Ukraine which has long been the
most virulently anrisemitic area of the Soviet Union. It is
reported from there that new excuses are being invented
regularly in order to 'justify' the refusal of an exit visa. The
authorities now insist, for example on the application being
made by an entire family — parents, children, grandparents,
aunts, uncles and cousins — and that the absence of any of
these will be fatal to the application. At the same time it is
reported that many regional offices of OVIR, the emigration
agency, have simply closed down for long periods.
What is equally disturbing is that there are signs of a new
wave of repression directed against refuseniks. In some
cases, this takes the form of hurting refuseniks through their
children of student age. A number of Jewish students have
been expelled from their colleges in recent weeks, and the
authorities are believed to be moving to conscript them.
Other refuseniks have been dismissed from their jobs — the
prelude to a charge of 'parasitism' (not having a job).
It has now become widely known that the authorities are
determined not to allow any demonstrations by refuseniks
and others to 'mar' the occasion of the Olympic Games. In
consequence, it is anticipated that all the leading refuseniks
will therefore be in prison, under house arrest or sent out of
the city in time for the Games.
MAKING ENDS MEET AT EASTER
Supplementary Benefit
If you are staying on in London and paying rent during the
vacation U12 chances are that you can get most of the money
that you have to pay in rent back from the D H S S
(Department of Health and Social Security) in the form of
Supplementary Benefit.
How To Claim
Ring up the nearest DHSS Office and tell them that you want
to claim for your rent during the vacation. Ask if you can
make an appointment for an interview and ask about the
procedure that they want you to follow and addresses of
places that you have to visit before going to see them. The
usual procedure once you have fixed up an interview is to
visit a Job Centre and see whether or not they have a
suitable job for you. If they haven't take the form that you
wul be given at the Job Centre to the nearest Department of
Employment Office and sign on as unemployed. Take the
form that they give you along to your DHSS interview. You
will also need proof of your resources eg bank statement and
saving books. You will then have to sign on every week as
unemployed.
Points To Watch
To claim Supplementary Benefit you need to be unemployed
and available for work. At the interview they may try and get
you to say that the reason you are staying in London is so
that you can study. In such a case they may well say that
since you are studying you can't be available for work and so
can't claim.
The impact of the tense international situation will be to
worsen still further the situation of Soviet Jewry. To a large
extent any improvement in their position and in the number
permitted to emigrate has come about as a result of Western
pressure combined with the Soviet need for trade and access
for Western technology. The opportunities that Western
pressure still have to make itself felt will be much less
frequent as long as relations between the West and the
USSR deteriorate. Ominiously, the emigration figures for
January 1980 have already shown a drop as compared to the
last months of 1979.
The outlook for Soviet Jewry in 1980 is bleak. A harder
attitude towards the community is likely to be reflected in
more anitsemitism in the (state-controlled) media, the
granting of fewer exist visas and in increased repression of
the activists in the Jewish emigration and cultural movement.
In the centre pages of this issue of FELIX, you will find a
petition on behalf of Imperial College Students' Union to be
delivered to the Soviet Embassy on Wednesday 19th March
by Chris Fox, Union President. We are asking you to add
your signature to this petition and send it via the internal mail
to Imperial College Jewish Society. (Just fold it as directed —
the address is on the back!) Please try to fill the petitions
rather than sending individual signatures, though these, too
will be welcome.
On the opening day of the Moscow Olympic Games (19th
July 1980) an advertisement is to appear in The Times
carrying the names of students and their supporters in the
United Kingdom and Ireland who wish to express their
disapproval of the inhumane treatment of Soviet Jewish
students. For a contribution of £1, your name will be included
below the following statement:
"Today, the start of the Olympic Games in
Moscow, we the students of the United Kingdom
and Ireland, and our supporters, deplore the
discrimination, harassment and imprisonment of our
Jewish colleagues in the Soviet Union."
CHRIS FOX adds:
"For over two years now, ICU has taken a special
interest in a Soviet Jew who has been enduring
many problems within Russia. At a time when most
. of the world will be focusing its eyes on Moscow, it
is essential that a true perspective of the Soviet
regime is maintained, and I urge you to sign the
petitions."
During next Tuesday lunchtime, we will be waiting to
receive your signature for both the ICU petition and the
Times advertisement in the JCR, .Sherfield Building.
If your accommodation doesn't have adequate facilities for
doing your own laundry, some offices can be prevailed upon
to give you an extra 60p per week so that you can go to the
launderette.
If you are a householder, ie responsible for such things as
paying standing charges on electricity meters or responsible
for other household expenses it is worth pointing this out at
your interview as you should then get £3.65 per week more
than the basic rate. Likewise, if you are a flat-sharer and split
these responsibilities you should be able to get an addition of
£3.65 divided by the number of sharers.
If you claim benefit in your home town for rent on
accommodation in London you will only get £2 per week (if
you are lucky). However, if you want to go home for part of
the vacation you can always ask for a holiday form which
excuses you from signing on in London. The chances of
getting one are pretty slim.
Some people have lost their benefit by asking the DHSS to
send the money to their home address rather than to the
place for which they are claiming rent. *
Unemployment Benefit
This is now harder to claim in most cases because they've
gone and changed the rules. To claim now you have to have
earned and payed National Insurance contributions on £750
between April 1977 and April 1978 or £875 between April
1978 and April 1979. If you claimed at Christmas for
Supplementary Benefit or Unemployment Benefit at Easter.
This is because of what is known as the 'thirteen week rule'
which states that if there is less than thirteen weeks between

If you're searching for some-
t h i n g n e w i n e n t e r t a i n m e n t
then the C o c k p i t Y o u t h Theatre
production of The Boyfriend is
worth experiencing. T h e theatre
in Marylebone is purpose built
for musicals with a cast of two
dozen young people.
A c t one opens with the band
p l a y i n g a n o v e r t u r e w h i c h
transfers us back to the twenties.
The production owes a lot to the
young people w h o provided the
musical continuity which at times
could have been slightly softer so
as not to d r o w n the singers.
The girls who played the pupils
at M a d a m e Dubonnet's finishing
school set the standard of the
production. S o m e were polished
d a n c e r s w h i l e o t h e r s w e r e
embarrassing to watch. W i t h
such a special theatre it is difficult
to hide a weak dancer. Just
putting them in the back row is
not enough.
I make special mention of
D a n y Allan w h o used the part of
M a i s i e t o h o l d t h e m u s i c a l
together. A s soon as she spoke
her first words she w o n the
audience's respect. T h e high
standard of Dany's singing a n d
dancing was so polished that I
advise her to try to blend a little
m o r e w i t h t h e r e s t of t h e
ensemble a n d to hold back until
the second act. Dany Allan
Charlotte C o x also had vitality
a n d I especially remember her
number "It's Nicer In N i c e "
where she showed her talents as
a vivacious singer a n d dancer.
T h e role played by Twiggy in the
film was taken by C l e a Wallis. I
feel that she was miscast as Polly,
but she put up a brave show and
if her duet with the delectable
M a d a m e Dubonnet in act three
had been deleted, then t h e
production would have reached
a strong finale.
If you've read this far y o u m a y .
wonder w h y the editor of F E L I X
has spent time seeing a musical
that, at first, seems a distance
from Imperial. T h e reason is that
m a n y s t u d e n t s h a v e b o u g h t
tickets for The Boyfriend a n d
there is still time to go a n d see it
as it doesn't finish until the 22nd
of M a r c h . If I may quote from a
letter Dany sent to me: "Could
y o u perhaps urge people from I C
to come and see the production
this Saturday (15th March) as I
expect that'll be one of the best
nights; we'll have h a d time to get
in the swing, and Saturday nights
are always best!"
There y o u have i t . . . a leading
member of the cast recommends
y o u to c o m e t o m o r r o w night.

are treated as being the same claim a n d your entitlement

Squatting
If y o u fancy a change from paying extortionate rents to live
with a crotchety landlady, here is a chance to try some free
and friendly, though possibly not too salubrious, low-living at
a secret location somewhere in L o n d o n !
The Tottenham Project organised by L S O is planning a
large scale squat which will go into occupation o n Saturday
15th M a r c h . Hopefully it will be well organised a n d so as safe
an introduction to this sometimes hazardous occupation as
one is likely to find.
If you are interested, assembly will be o n Saturday 15th
M a r c h at 11:00am at Kingsway Princeton College, Sidmouth
Street, G r a y s Inn R o a d , L o n d o n W C l . Y o u will n e e d a
