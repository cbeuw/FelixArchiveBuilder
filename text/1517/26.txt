The horror of the modern
day horror
Regular readers might know I’ve covered a few
horror games in my time – Amnesia: The Dark
Descent, Dead Rising 2, Dead Space 2, Limbo,
and how could I fail to mention Baron Wittard:
Nemesis of Ragnarok (a game as scary as a furi-
ous kitten). I’ve also played a good few games
I haven’t written about. Why am I telling you
this? Beyond proving I have no social life, I
also hope to demonstrate that I’m rather par-
tial towards horror games. They offer a unique
gaming experience – when done well.
Unfortunately, that’s my eternal gripe. As
it is, horror has mostly lost its edge when it
comes to video games. Whilst what scares
people differs from person to person there are
a few aspects that are vitally important when
you set out to create a game intending to nudge
people onto the edge of their seats. These are
just a few.
Tone
First, a game has to decide upon its tone before
going any further. Is it going to be a scary hor-
ror, designed to creep you out? A light hearted
horror, where the horror serves merely as a
minor backdrop? Games such as Amnesia or
Dead Rising 2 have nailed this – they know
what they want to be. Amnesia deliberately sets
out to scare you and does so with great aplomb.
Likewise, Dead Rising 2 wants you to have
mindless fun, and the ensuing goofy, off
the wall gameplay with zombies thrown
in does not disappoint. There is nothing
wrong with games like Dead Rising 2
or Left 4 Dead, because you know
from the advertising what you’re
getting.
No so with games such as
Doom 3 or Doom 3: Res-
urrection of Evil. Such
games are set out as
horrors, when in reality
they’re better suited as
action shooters. The Doom
series up until 3 got this
— demons were just a
handy enemy to mas-
sacre. Attempts
to make Doom
overly scary
have created
a game that’s
neither here
nor there. It’s
a competent
s h o o t e r ,
but lots of
d a r k n e s s
does not
a horror game
make.

From silly zombies we get to a silly dog somehow ca-
pable of contorting its body with complete disregard
for its internal organs. If this wasn’t a flash game the
RSPCA would have a field day.
Twist, turn and guide your way through a series
of lasers, floating mines and block switches to col-
lect a bunch of jewels for no adequately explained
reason other than that it’s fun. Some randomly mov-
ing mines may frustrate slightly, but otherwise Silly
Sausage provides hours of fun (along with a mildly
humourous title).
You can’t control who you fall in love with, any more
than you can control the tides or the rise and fall of
the Sun. Romance between a man and his zombi-
fied lover must never, therefore, be looked down
upon.
i saw her standing there is a cutesy little game
involving a (somewhat deluded) man guiding his
zombified heart throb to a protective cage. In the
way stand an army of envious zombie Lotharios.
Will you win her heart? Will she win your brains?
Only one way to find out...

More exams? If you care about what sort of
grades you’ll get it’s probably best you don’t read
on any further my friends, because here I present
to you two totally awesome web games that you
can play right now in your web browser. In order to
play these you’re going to need the Adobe Flash
Player plug-in, which can be installed from http://

Monsters
Monsters are right at home in horror – but not all
monsters are effective. A good horror should use
them sparingly. The human imagination is a wild
and vivid thing, and letting people imagine what
liesinadarkenedroomfilledwithheavy,laboured
breathingisfarmoreeffectivethanshowingthem.
What is deemed visually scary by one person
may not to someone else, and vice versa. What
sounds scary tends to be more common – think
mewling kittens versus snarling, disembodied
gurgling. Some of the scariest moments in
Doom 3 simply involved noises in air vents and
corpses being dragged away by an unseen entity.
When a monster is seen, it obviously has
to look scary. Now this, as I’ve said, is
a very subjective point. However, one
concept in 3D design tends to be well
accepted, that of the uncanny valley,
a hypothesis in 3D computer
animation that states that
as a human replica
becomes more and
more human it
will reach a point at
which it looks and
acts almost
human. This
is the point
revulsion
kicks in.
Monsters
that look
human or,
e v e n
better, ones that look like they could have been
humans work well, such as the nurses and
Pyramid Head from Silent Hill (pictured). On
an unconscious level the brain creeps out, but
you can’t quite work out why. This is at least
a redeeming factor in Dead Space – whilst the
monsters may jump out at you all the time,
you can clearly see they’re horrifically mutated
humans,andthat‘creep’factorwormsitswayinto
your brain. Talking of jumping out all the time...
Pacing and Tension
Everyone ought to be familiar with the concept
of tension – after all, it is exam season – but
pacing is less well understood. Pacing is how
the highs and the lows of the game mix together,
and is better described with examples.
In Dead Space enemies attack you all the time
with little let-up. You are constantly attacking,
and because of this a) you end up mentally
exhausted, b) there’s no tension because you
know something is going to jump out soon, and
c) the monsters fail to have that same scare fac-
tor. Constant action in a game where you can’t
just run ‘n’ gun makes for a negatively draining
experience.
On the other hand Amnesia manages pacing
well. A main annex in each level is safe, but
everywhere you branch off to isn’t. When you
reach one of these annex’s calming music plays,
signifying a break in the action, allowing you to
compose yourself before starting up again. It’s a
palette cleanser, and serves to keep the
game constantly scary by preventing
the tension from overwhelming you.
Is it unfair to compare these two radi-
cally different games, each with
different developers and goals?
Perhaps. But ultimately both
games set out to scare, and in
the end only one succeeds. A
large part of this is simply
down to how the action is
spaced out. Pacing can-
not be ignored.
Making good hor-
ror is a lot more com-
plex than what I’ve
glanced over here, and
my displeasure when
it comes to modern
horror games has only
just begun to break free
onto paper. Despite ev-
erything though, I have
nothing against any of the
aforementioned games —
they are all at least com-
petent. They’re just
not scary when they
promised they would
be. To quote something I wrote in
my first Felix article – “It’s [modern horror] fun,
but it’s like ordering a banana split and receiv-
ing a fillet steak – I like fillet steak, and I’ll eat
it, but I would have much preferred my banana-
based dessert.”
“Letting people imagine
what lies in a darkened
room filled with heavy,
laboured breathing is
far more effective than
showing them.”
