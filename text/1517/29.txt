Michael’s Revision Fasstangle
Following the groundbreaking suc-
cess of January’s Benedict Cumberbox
comes a handy revision/procrastina-
tion tool from illustrious actor Michael
Fassbender.
Heed his steely gaze and use this box
to your advantage. Derive your favou-
rite equation, perhaps. Draw a horse.
Or introduce the man who brought you
the definitive Mangeto to an arctic land-
scape; the possibilities are quite liter-
ally endless.
Take a shot and send the results in
to puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk. Last
time we ran something like this we only
got one entry, and that was from Amer-
ica. Expectations are higher than ever.
Wordoku
The return of a legend.
The traditional wordoku has every
row, column and 3x3 box containing
one letter each. The end result is a rath-
er useless word or phrase that appears
in one of the rows or columns.
As usual, answers to puzzles.felix@
imperial.ac.uk, but the whole grid
please, not just the word. HINT: The word isn’t ‘tnetennba’
If you’d like to contribute by sending in puzzles, comics or even some ed-
iting, e-mail puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk. Be they horrendously com-
plicated things or funky picture puzzles you think readers would like,
do get in touch. General suggestions are also welcome.
