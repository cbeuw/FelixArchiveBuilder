As a salesperson, you should
begin to rate yourself as the
best in Europe. Once you de-
cide to work for yourself, you
may never go back to work
for somebody else. Sell the
crunch, not the apple. Keep
in mind at the same time that
opportunities are like buses,
there’s always another one
coming.
When in doubt, run that idea
you’ve had floating around
in the back of your mind up
the flagpole. Assess the re-
actions of your colleagues
and proceed accordingly. If
you are cautious, the results
may prove fruitful and fairly
unique. A picture is worth
1,000 words, sure, but it uses
up 3,000 times the memory.
Let’s touch base. At the end
of the day, there has been
a significant change in the
way people percieve you
recently. You wholly enjoy
the positive attention. But
remember that if you can’t
ride two horses at the same
time you shouldn’t be in the
circus. Don’t sell the steak,
sell the sizzle.
It looks as though you’re rac-
ing against the clock towards
an arbitrary goal, but when
push comes to shove, the
devil is in the details. Do not
wait to strike until the iron is
hot; but make it hot by strik-
ing. Remember, if you’re go-
ing to be thinking anything,
you might as well think big.
Words to live by.
Do not follow where the path
may lead. Go instead where
there is no path and leave a
trail. What chance gathers
she easily scatters. A great
person attracts great people
and knows how to hold them
together. It’s a 24/7 business,
and it’s time to separate the
wheat from the chaff, and
then bring them together.
If a=1%, b=2%, c= 3%, etc.,
what does ‘attitude’ add up
to? Figured it out yet? That’s
right. 100%. Attitude is job
one. When you’re up to your
armpits in alligators, it’s hard
to remember to drain the
swamp. No crime is so great
as daring to excel. Don’t let
anyone tell you otherwise.
Stay strong.
To win without risk is to tri-
umph without glory, and a
clean desk is a sign of a
cluttered desk drawer. Also,
a penny saved is a penny
earned. Bear in mind, how-
ever, that you can’t be a true
winner until you have lost.
Stick a fork in it, it’s done.
After all, you have to spend
money to make money.
The expectations of life de-
pend upon diligence; the
mechanic that would perfect
his work must first sharpen
his tools. You need to be
aware of what others are do-
ing, applaud their efforts, ac-
knowledge their successes,
and encourage them in their
pursuits. When we all help
one another, everybody wins.
You have a lot riding on the
success of an ongoing proj-
ect, so give it an extra push
and see it soar. The only
place where Success comes
before Work is in the diction-
ary, and there’s only one IF
in LIFE – between the L and
the E. Go hard or go home.
When the rubber meets the
road, there’s only one choice.
It may be true that the ear-
ly bird gets the worm, but
keep in mind that the sec-
ond mouse gets the cheese.
It’s time to stop paving the
cowpath and knuckle down
with some facts and stats. In
addition, there’s something
you’ve been meaning to say
to a loved one, but it can wait
because the FTSE’s up.
Web 2.0 is all the rage at the
moment, but what about Life
2.0? Everybody needs to
push the envelope and gen-
erate the required synergy to
bring about a real paradigm
shift in today’s society. Take it
the next level and bring your
A-game to the table. Let’s hit
the ground running and step
up to all of the plates.
