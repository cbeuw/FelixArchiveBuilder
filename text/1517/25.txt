The Gormenghast Trilogy
H
ow do I describe a work
like Mervyn Peake’s
Gormenghast Trilogy?
The series, by its very
nature, seems to resist
description. While often classed as fan-
tasy, and while it is clear that Peake has
been a massive inspiration to later fan-
tasy authors like China Miéville, I tend
to reject this label. The Gormenghast
books are a truly unique creation, in a
genre of their own – I have never read
anything else like them.
The first two novels, Titus Groan and
Gormenghast, are set in the sprawling,
crumbling castle of Gormenghast itself.
Situated at the base of Gormenghast
Mountain it is, apart from the small
mud hut village that clings to its walls,
the only human habitation visible as far
as the eye can see. This is a setting with-
out magic, elves or dragons. On the face
of it the books could be taking place in
our world but there is something bril-
liantly, gothically, subtly off about the
castle’s perpetual isolation and the be-
haviour of its denizens.
A vast cast of richly drawn characters
populates the books yet they are not
the real focus of the series. From the
depressed Lord Sepluchrave, the 76th
Earl of Groan, whose only solace in life
is his vast library; to his son Titus, who
longs for freedom and a life outside
of Gormenghast; to the ambitious and
ruthless servant Steerpike – everyone’s
lives are irrevocably shaped by the cas-
tle itself.
This is not a book for those who like
fast paced action and adventure. The
plot is slow paced and, while compel-
ling in itself, its main purpose is to
shine a light on the workings of the an-
cient, in large parts unexplored citadel,
and the seemingly senseless rituals that
surround it. We never do find out who
build it or how it got in its present state
is but, what is far more important, we

do get a feel of the atmosphere and its
soul.
Peake was also a master illustrator,
with his drawings for Alice in Wonder-
land having been universally praised.
His work for Gormenghast is even bet-
ter – the books are greatly enriched by
his beautiful, atmospheric line draw-
ings. Rarely have I seen pictures that
complement the feel of the novel so
well.
The third book, Titus Alone, focuses
on the eponymous protagonist as he
finally feels Gormenghast and sets out
into the world. This he finds to be a
strange place, ruled by rational but cold
and dispassionate science. The main
conflict of the novel is that between this
harsh modern world and the oppresive
tradition of Gormenghast.
This is noticeably the weakest book
in the series. While I was certainly
perturbed by his repeated depiction of
scientists as immoral the main criti-
cism that I have to level at Titus Alone
is that, now that we have moved away
from Gormenghast castle, there seems
to have been a loss of focus. In many
places it unclear what the author is try-
ing to say or where the novel is lead-
ing us. The book, unfortunately, shows
clear signs having been written during
“The plot is slow
paced and, while
compelling in itself,

“The novel is cer-
tainly imaginative
with a broad scope
in mind.”
the long illness that eventually claimed
Peake’s life.
There are, however, still flashes of
brilliance. Despite the new setting
Peake, for the most part, manages to
maintain the timeless, otherworldly,
gothic feel of his previous work. The
cruel and macabre theatrical recreation
of Titus’ life in Gormenghast set up by
the self-centred Cheeta in an attempt to
punish him for rejecting her is executed
perfectly. The novel is worth reading
for the poignant final chapter itself,
which has a wonderful sense of closure,
with Titus finally managing to recon-
cile his rigid, rule bound upbringing in
the castle with his desire for freedom,
while leaving the door wide open for
the sequels that Peake never managed
to write.
While I usually don’t make recom-
mendations about specific publishers,
in this case I would strongly advise
against purchasing the omnibus edi-
tions of the trilogy published by Vin-
tage. The countless typographical er-
rors are tantamount to sacrilege against
such a great classic. While some errors
will always slip through their sheer
number here makes it clear that nobody
even bothered to do a proof read before
publication. While the editions remain
readable you’ll have a far more plea-
surable experience if you buy the indi-
vidual volumes of the series seperately,
since for these, at least, the publishers
seem to have actually done their job
properly.
Peake’s haunting illustrations are a major asset of the series

tiful, atmospheric
