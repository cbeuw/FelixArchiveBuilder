F
irstly, let me clarify – I am
not a hipster.
I feel compelled to begin
with that statement because
after reading this article,
you may come to the conclusion that I
am a hipster. I assure you I am not. You
will not catch me wearing an inordi-
nate amount of wool, or styling thick-
rimmed glasses in spite of my 20/20 vi-
sion, or listening to awful music whose
only attraction is that no one has ever
heard of it. Indeed, it is my belief that
when the final bell tolls and Ragnarok
rages across the Earth, I will be locked
in a battle to the death with the King of
the Hipsters.
I had to start with that caveat because
I do not follow the crowd. In most cas-
es of mainstream, I am actively fight-
ing against the current like some free-
thinking salmon, or paddling down my
own isolated tributary.
I have many examples. Harry Pot-
ter, to start with. I’ve read four of the
books but only after the glorious ‘new
book’ smell has faded from between
the covers of a library dustjacket.
By this time, revelations like “Snape
kills Dumbledore! OMG!” were old
news and held no more shock appeal.
Oh, spoiler alert, I guess. I’m better
with the film, having seen seven out
of eight, because I’ve got no problem
with watching a good film. Maybe be-
cause I wasn’t swept along in the initial
wave of hype and hyperbole but I can’t
I am not a hipster – it’s too mainstream
see anything extraordinary about Harry
Potter. Good books, yes, but amazing,
maybe not.
The same can be said for The Girl
with the Dragon Tattoo, George R. R.
Martin and most recently The Hunger
Games. Unlike the majority of London
Underground commuters, I’ve yet to
crack the spine of any of these books.
In fairness, this might be due to the in-
frequency that I use the tube. As long
as my bike keeps running, I’m just not
exposed to the next must-read book.
In other areas, I’m a big fan of
James Blunt. Though he tends to be a
bit on the whiny side, his third album
was balanced with much more upbeat
songs. I also liked Indiana Jones and
the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (and
Temple of Doom for that matter). Al-
iens can’t be beyond the shark for a
series that has the Ark of the Covenant
melt a man’s face. That film’s problem
is that it has to compete in such a great
series without the benefit of rose-tinted
spectacles.
This misalignment with the main-
stream stems from my childhood, I
think. I wasn’t that popular in school
and so I instinctively shunned what I
thought was popular. I even resisted
Pokémon for a good while but there
is only so long you can put off be-
coming a Poké-mon master. I like to
think I’ve overcome this proto-hipster
counter-cultural reflex, but even now
the fact that something is being read
or watched by everyone is unlikely to
endear it de facto to me.
This does tend to isolate me some-
what in social situations – it’s a posi-
tion I’m more than used to. It means
I’m limited to the most rudimentary of
questions when my topic of specialist
ignorance comes up at parties. More
often than not, I excuse myself to the
kitchen and try to do some washing up
for want of anything better to do. How-
ever, the reverse is far more interesting.
If the discourse turns to my interests I
have to argue harder, with far greater
passion, in order to engender curiosity
in my audience. I’m proselytising, I
know that, but I want people to like the
things I like. As I said, I’m no hipster.
Given the sheer volume of must-read
books and must-watch TV out there,
it’s near-impossible to keep your head
above the waters of the mainstream.
By the time you’ve finished the tril-
ogy or the box-set, everyone else has
moved on and is talking about the next
big thing.
In contrast, my stream may be small-
er but it has a much gentler current. In
it, I can paddle at my own pace. And I
repeat, I am not a hipster.
