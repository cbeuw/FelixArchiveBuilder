SLITHERLINK
Hold on to your collective hats,
Slitherlink makes a triumphant
return!
The aim with Slitherlink is to
make one continuous closed loop
by connecting the dots. The num-
bers in each square indicate how
many edges of the square are part
of the loop, so if it contains a
“2”, you know that two and only
two out of four edges have lines.
That’s all the info you need to get
the one logical answer (though
waiting a week to see the solution
will also do). Answers to puzzles.
felix@imperial.ac.uk. We can’t
get enough of your answers, for
reals.

Nonogram – Baked Goods
The cells in a grid have to be coloured or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid. The numbers measure how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares
there are in any given row or column. The overall solution should yield some sort of picture, or as good as a picture can look in monochrome on a 15x15 grid. As
usual, answers to puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
We’ve been reliably
informed that last
week’s Nonogram
didn’t work, sorry!
This week’s has been
checked and double
checked alongside
external examiners,
so if this one fails as
well, blame them.
Remember, if you
ever want to submit
