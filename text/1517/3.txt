Additionally, James Loy, the former
US Deputy Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity said, “This is a new realm, this
is a new era that demands international
co-operation associated with crimes that
have international implications. TheAh-
mad case is that case.”
Amna Ahmad and the rest of Babar
Ahmad’s family will continue with their
Free Babar Ahmad Campaign. Amna
Ahmad said, “We’re not afraid of a trial.
We’re not afraid of him being charged
with anything. We’re actually asking for
that. So that he can have an opportunity
to see the allegations, to see the evi-
dence, to be questioned in an open court
of law with a jury of his peers.”

justice and ensure that Babar should be
put on trial in the UK, along with a full
public inquiry into his case. His father
stated that the British justice “appears
to have been subcontracted to the US”.
Amna Ahmad, Babar Ahmad’s sister,
has raised concerns about her brother’s
mental health, saying, “there’s only so
much a person in that condition could
do.”
However, The European Court of Hu-
man Rights said that he would not be
subject to “ill-treatment” in the US. The
judges said that the US authorities are
“justified” in treating convicted terror-
ists as a “significant security risk” and
are therefore allowed to limit their com-
munications with the outside world.
In an interview with the BBC con-
ducted at Long Lartin Prison in early
April, Babar Ahmad gave his own
views on his detainment. He told the
BBC: “I have never been questioned
about the allegations against me. I have
never been shown the evidence against
me.” Babar Ahmad urged the Director
of Public Prosecutions to put him on
trial in the UK to find out what has gone
wrong with his case.
In the campaign to free Babar Ahmad,
an official government online petition
was created to generate support against
his extradition and was signed by over
140,000 people. There was enough
support for the petition to be taken the
House of Commons to be debated. On
30 March, the House of Commons
Home Affairs Select Committee re-
leased a report that concluded that the
US-UK Extradition Treaty should be
amended to deal with the unease of the
fairness of the Treaty.
Scotland Yard released a statement,
which said: “The Metropolitan Police
Service carried out their investigation
strictly in accordance with UK law.
This process involved close liaison
with the Crown Prosecution Service.
We completely reject any suggestion
of impropriety.” They also stated, “All
extradition requests made to the United
Kingdom are subject to the Extradition
