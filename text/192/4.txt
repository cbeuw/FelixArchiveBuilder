A Y E A R OF FORTUNE A N D MISFORTUNE FOR T H E
SAILING CLUB
The year began quite normally for the Sailing Club, with A
and B points races, and instruction of novices proceeding well
throughout the Autumn Term. The first team, whose members com-
prise half of the U.L. first team, had several matches, home and
away, during this term, and the second team met several other
college teams, unfortunately without marked success.
It was also hoped at the beginning of the year to organise an
I.C. ladies team, but this did not come about because of a lack of
the most essential items for this enterprise.
The term ended with I.C. boats
lying 2nd and 4th in " A " points
and 1st and 2nd in " B " points,
and with about 175 hours of in-
struction completed.
The Christmas vacation
brought sub-Arctic temperatures,
as all will undoubtedly remem-
ber, and by the beginning of the
Spring Term, ice on the Harp
was about five inches deep. Ice
is apt to make Firefly sailing
rather difficult, but no one was
unduly worried, as this sort of
thing has happened several times
before at the beginning of
January.
We were not to know, how-
ever, that the coldest weather
this century was about to descend
upon our unsuspecting little
island from the unfriendly wastes
of Siberia. This is what trans-
pired, nevertheless, and the ice
remained on the Harp for two
more months, attaining a thick-
ness of nine or ten inches at the
height of the cold season. Skaters
and ice-yachters had much exer-
cise during that period, but for
us the Spring Term was virtually
a write-off. This was very unfor-
tunate, because for both racing
and instruction, the Spring Term
is usually our most active period.
However, about ten days before
the end of term, when we were
all contemplating taking up ski-
ing or snow-waste walking or"
some other Arctic sport, the snow
and ice finally vanished from the
Harp. The greatest scenes of
chaos since the sacking of Rome
immediately ensued, as chair-
bound Sailing Club officers re-
ceived word that the Castaway's
Cup series of team races would
be held in about a week's time.
The Castaway's Cup is an an-
nual competition organised by
Castaways S.C. (which consists of
ex-members of U.L.S.C.), and
there is keen rivalry between the
constituent colleges of U.L.S.C.
over the cup. Normally, most of
the Spring term is devoted to
training and preparation for
Castaway's, so it is a tribute to
the organisers that the event took
place at all. But all went well,
and the competition was sailed
over a week-end in strong winds.
I.C., who already held the cup
from last year (the first time we
have won it), retained it in fine
style with a finals battle against
Chelsea.
It was decided, towards the end
of the Spring Term, to award
" A " and " B " points trophies
on the strength of the Autumn
Term's results alone. I.C. there-
fore came 1st and 2nd in " B "
points, owing to the efforts of
Hugh Tothill and Andrew Thom-
son, and 2nd and 4th in " A "
points through the efforts of Dave
Pertz and Eric Twiname.
It is interesting to note that
this is the first year for many
years that I.C. has not won " A "
points. It was won this year by
Graham Taylor, who used to win
it for us when he was at I.C., but
now lectures at Battersea. Thus
we were in good spirits after
Castaway's, until we lost one of
our boats. Two days after Casta-
way's weekend F 2168 was
placed on a trailer prior to re-
moval from the Harp for main-
tenance. The following day an
individual with felonious tenden-
cies removed her to another
trailer and departed, and neither
he nor the boat have been seen
since. This was a great blow, as
F 2168 was one of our better
boats, and with her went two
suits of sails and other sundry
gear. However, the vessel is in-
sured, so we will have a new boat
if she is not found.
During the Easter vacation
several cruises were organised.
Three boats went for a week on
the Norfolk Broads, and two East
Coast cruises took place from
Maldon. One of these, occupy-
ing a fortnight, extended to Hol-
land, the other, for one week
only, got no further than Mar-
gate, owing to rather boisterous
seas and gale force winds,
although an enjoyable time was
still had by all the crew.
The Summer Term, in which
we now find ourselves, is never a
very active one for the Sailing
Club, as many people are struck
by an entirely unreasonable urge
(usually produced by not so un-
reasonable fears) to concentrate
on academic work to the detri-
ment of their sailing. In spite of
this attitude, however, we man-
aged to hold our Annual Cham-
pionships on Wednesday, May
15th, where some quite keen
competition was encountered.
The Novices Trophy was won by
Robin Gray, who entered the
club as a fresher at the beginning
of the year, the Single-Handed
Trophy by Dave Pentz, the Com-
modore (who is an old hand at
one-man sailing as he owns his
own Finn), and the Double-
Handed trophy by Eric Twiname,
next year's Commodore.
The year's events have almost
finished now, and in all we have
had quite a successful time. We
now need to ensure that next year
will not be a mediocre one. We
hope to have six boats in full
order next year, and three of
them will be almost new (under
six months old) so there will be
ample opportunity for people to
race or to learn to sail. Anyone
toying with the idea of ceasing tc
be a landlubber will be very wel-
come in the club next year, when
the officers will try to uphold, or
improve on, the successes of this
year, while trying to eliminate the
misfortunes.
