Outsider chosen for Top Union Post
At the Joint Council Meeting
(reported elsewhere in this issue)
which took place last Monday,
Dave Watson, a Physics Post-
Grad., was elected to the post of
President of the Union for the
n
e
x
t session. The result came as
a surprise to many people, in
v
i
e
w of the fact that Dave Wat-
s
o
n was not known very well
generally, unlike the three other
candidates. After the initial chit
c
h
a
t of the Council Meeting, the
Election of Presiden* was reached
on the agenda, and in a tense at-
mosphere, votes were collected
and counted. A straight majority
is required, and plural voting is
used—the candidate with the
least number of votes in the first
ballot drops out, then the next
and so on.
John Madison dropped out at
thefirstballot, then Dave Loftus,
leaving it as a straight vote be-
tween Preece and Watson. The
last few minutes were rather
tense, and to break the spell, the
Chairman carried on with a few
of the other elections. Appar-
ently the voting was fairly close,
but in the end it was Watson who
was declared elected, congratu-
lated and invited to sit in on the
rest of the Council Meeting:
" You're a member of Council as
from just now."
H. D. D. Watson was born in
December 1939, was educated at
Belfast Roval Academy. In 1961
he was awarded a double first in
Maths and Physics at Cambridge,
and then came to IC to join the
Theoretical Physics Group. He
has always been a keen delater
—some people will remember
him speaking at the last NUS
debate—and edited his College
magazine at Cambridge. As far
as sporting activities are con-
cerned, he played for thefirstX V
both at school and at Cambridge
(St. Catherine's), and is interested
in mountaineering. This year he
has served as the President of the
Mountaineering Club at IC, and
is one of the organisers of "this
year's Greenland Epedition.
We look forward to his term of
office.
PRESIDENTS—Past and Future.
PARTING SHOTS—UNION MEETING 28th MAY
The last Union Meeting of the term is usually similar to a mutual
admiration society—all the boys have done a grand job, and so
have I because they say so. This one was also injected with doses
of David Fiost designed to stir a little more reaction from the dying
session. This year there will probably be a cabaret at the President's
Ball—the entertainers are around and they even write their own
material. Some of them tried it out on a non-paying audience and
met witlj some setbacks. Doubtless they will rewrite a little, but
much went down rather well. The Hon. Sec. started off with the
opening numbe r, " Minutes," which was brief and amusing.
One of the stars was missing,
so instead of Taff Phillips we had
his deputy, Dennis Foster, who
recited the maestro's prose in
measured, inaudible tones. The
Sporting mob this year have had
a bad year, what with the wea-
ther and that CEM place, and the
Judo Club lost to the Met. Police.
It is the subde joke that wins
most applause from the sophisti-
cated audiences present at Union
Meetings; " more hostels will
mean more sport" produced gi-
gantic belly laughs from the
Editor of a notorious College
newspaper and Jim Carter, while
everyone else creased silently.
