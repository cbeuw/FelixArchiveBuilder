RCS REVIEW
The A.G.M. of the R.C.S.
Union was held on May 23rd, in
the main Chemistry Lecture
Theatre. The election of depart-
mental reps., trophy officers, etc.,
was conducted efficiently by the
President. As a test of strength,
the candidates for the two posts
of trophy officer were required to
lift the large bulk of the vice-
president into the air. These
candidates were also questioned
about their moral suitability for
the post. One ' gentleman,' who
was proposed and seconded by 5
women, when asked what he
wore in bed, replied that it de-
pended upon whom he was sleep-
ing with. He was elected. The
other trophy officer elected was
apparently under the influence of
drink at the time. Enemies of
R.C.S. should have an interesting
time trying to steal Theta next
year.
The only sporting success of
the year was. the winning of
Sports Day by^ the Mhletics
Team. This was fortunate for it
provided several cups and mem-
bers of the Union used these filled
with beer to drink the health of
the Union. The Annual Reports
were presented. During the Presi-
dent's Report, four individuals,
one dressed as a priest and one
a
s a hangman, descended from
the back of the lecture theatre
carrying some wooden beams.
These were quickly converted
into a set of gallows. The meet-
ling waited expectantly. Mr.
CHRIS T Y E
Harris concluded his report and
handed over the chair to the new
President. Having done this he
was simultaneously arrested, tried
and sentenced to death by hang-
ing. The priest" read the last
rites ; Mr. Harris refused con-
fession. Just as he was being
strung up, he was saved by a
" giggle of nymphs " who trans-
ported him bodily (with head
attached) to safety, much to the
annoyance of the assembled mob.
Officers for the next year :
President Chris Tye
Vice-President ... Simon Adlam
Secretary Mike McMahon
Assistant Secretary ... Andrea
Sutherland
SILWOOD HOUSE BALL
I An extremely warm evening
and the pleasant grounds of Sil-
wood Park combined well to give
a romantic setting to the Silwood
Ball. Initially the number of
couples strolling in the grounds
(and halting a while behind the
bushes) was greater than the
number dancing inside to Les
Leyton's band. The buffet
supper (prepared by V. Mooney
land Co., S.W.7) was generally
enjoyed, even allowing for the
omission of coffee and the dis-
crepancy between the printed
jmenu and the meal served.
I The dancers and the strollers
1 (about 80 couples in all) were
limited by the cabaret provided at
Ishort notice by Mick Emery
•(vocalist in Alan Elsdon's Jazz,
Band) who sang beautifully to his
jown guitar accompaniment. The
decoration of the main hall of
line house in which the dancing
takes place is always difficult.
JThis year it was attempted by the
1u
s
e of clever lighting, but unfor-
tunately the early failure of some
jcolour filters spoilt this.
1 The front exterior of the house
jwas flood-lit, providing a hom-
ling beacon for couples wandering
•in the countryside. One mis-
Ichievous twit obtained great
amusement from directing a
flood-light into the surrounding
countryside, thereby disturbing
several couples.
After a repeat cabaret per-
formance the dancing continued
until 5.30 a.m. Dawn came at
about 4 o'clock reminding every-
one that they had been up all
night and so feeling tired they
began to drift home. To those
who knew nothing of the
drama behind the scenes it
was a great success; to those
who knew of the organisers' diffi-
culties and watched the R.C.S.
Entertainments Committee grey-
ing at the temples, it was a
miracle. The main trouble, as
Mr. K. Sadhvani explained many
times at great length during the
evening, was the sudden cancel-
lation of the arranged cabaret on
the day before. Fortunately,
thanks to Ken Crobson, Mick
Emery was contacted and he was
an excellent substitute.
The R.C.S. Ents. Committee
are to be congratulated on their
achievement, which has crowned
a very successful year of enter-
taining. They worked continu-
ously from 10.0 a.m. Friday until
8.0 a.m. Saturday. Many thanks
Let us hope that their efforts re-
to them for a fine, enjoyable ball,
suit in a higher attendance at
next year's ball.
SPANNERAMA
23rd of May saw the. last
Guilds Union Meeting of this ses-
sion. Despite the close proximity
of the exams, the meeting
was well supported. First
item on the agenda was
"elections," and Bob Schroter
was elected (unopposed) Presi-
dent, Rod Jones, Vice-President
and Mike Cox, Secretary. As a
result of a last minute nomina-
tion, Jim Carter defeated Robin
Claridge, to receive the most
coveted award in Guilds, the
Norris Muck Stirring Trophy.
With the serious business of
the day over, the President rose
amidst tumultuous cheers, and
cries of " strip, strip," to give his
annual report. Various clubs in
Guilds have had a most active
and successful year, judging by
the appearance of various items
of silverware at Union Meet-
ings. The finances have been put
on a rational basis, and judging
from the preliminary figures is-
sued, net results have been most
beneficial. Summing up, the
President said that no more than
an averagely successful year
could be claimed, this being
partly due to the unsuitability of
Room 542 in Mech.Eng. for
Union Meetings, and the shifting
nature of the College brought
about by the appearance of new
buildings. The full effect of the
new buildings is still to be fully
felt, and will no doubt prove a
great challenge to next year's
President and Executive. Chris
Liddle concluded by saying what
good blokes all Guildsmen are
(which we know, anyway) and by
wishing the next Exec, all the
best.
Next item on the agenda was
the Field Cup, which, for the un-
initiated, is a sort of glorified
treasure hunt, the clues leading to
some "thing " which must be re-
covered, and brought back.
Spurred on by the beery prize,
various departmental groups sped
off in diverse directions.
The proceedings, however, de-
generated into complete chaos,
due to laying of false clues by
Electricals, a most ungentlemanly
activity. (Editors' note—After all,
what else can you expect from
Guildsmen ?) The member of
one group even ended up swim-
ming under the Serpentine Bridge
in order to retrieve a thing (?)
that was floating about. On the
way back to College and their
shining goal, the possessors of
the thing were foully way-
laid on the steps of Mech.Eng.,
the bloody melee stopping after
some 15 minutes when the parti-
cipants were informed that the
' thing' in their possession had
nothing to do with the Field Cup.
BOB SCHROTER
The beer was eventually won
by Electricals who kindly shared
it with the old lags of the other
departments.
In conclusion, we would just
like to say that we wish all our
fellow Guildsmen all the best for
the coming year.
Can Bob do this ?
DRAMATIC SOCIETY
The Drama Soc. Old Lags (the
Comus Club) are presenting
"The Importance of Being
Earnest" for the London Inter-
national Students Club on Au-
gust 14th, 15th and 16th, at 7.30
each night in the Concert Hall.
It is hoped that members of the
College who will be in London at
that time will come and see it.
