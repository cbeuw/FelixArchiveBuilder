JOINT COUNCIL. JUNE 10th, 1963
On Monday last, Joint Council elected Dave' Watson as Presi-
dent of the College and Dave Loftus as Secretary.
Four candidates were up for the election. During the voting,
the other elections were carried through. The first ballot resulted
in the elimination of John Maddison, the second ballot, announced
amidst rising tension, left Preece and Watson. Council voted again
and Watson was in
This event was the most im-
portant one of the evening but
previous to this, the ugly head of
relations between the Union and
South Side Halls of residence had
been reared. A letter had been
sent by the Tizard Hall Com-
mittee to the SCC and the RCC
concerning the use of their gal-
lery levels. The RCC and SCC
were invited to hold meetings in
South Side in the gallery levels of
Tizard Hall. In a letter ad-
dressed to Council, the Tizard
Committee apologised for writing
direct to the RCC-SCC instead of
to Council, and claimed that their
intentions had been misinter-
preted. The Executive and Coun-
cil, with the notable exceptions of
the Chairmen of the A C C and
SCC were unanimous in their
reply. Halls should concern
themselves with their own resi-
dents, and should work with the
Union to the best advantage of
all the students of the College.
Their activities should at all
times be complementary to those
of the Union, rather than com-
petitive.
Two other important points
cropped up. The President and
Mr. Watson were both concerned
about the Debating Society. This
should be one of the most active
in the College, its members com-

prising the whole student body.
Instead, it has seen a decline of
late, and Council expressed dis-
satisfaction with the conduct of
the Society and urged the Chair-
man of the SCC to examine the
matter seriously.
The second matter was brought
up by Mr. Knight, the Old Cen-
tralians representative. After the
announcement of Union General
Awards, Mr. Knight showed
Council why he had been one of
the recipients. In an eloquent
•earnest speech, he put forward
ample reason for caution as re-
gards Union finances. The union
receives some £700 p.a. from in-
vestments made by past Councils.
As a rule, ten per cent, of our
annual income is invested, with
the result that finances are
boosted by the interest. Esti-
mates for the next session exceed
income, and these do not even in-
clude the usual ten per cent, to
be invested. Mr. Knight pointed
out the folly of this : if invest-
ment decreases, so will income in
the long run, due to lower in
terest. He did not disagree with
the formation of new clubs, but
Council must consider the wis-
dom of their present actions
whifch could jeopardise future
finances.
Apart from Mr. Knight, the
following members of the Col-
lege received Union General
Awards ;
Andrew Pawlowicz—
Editor of Felix
John Maddison—
Carnival Organiser
Dave Dean—Boat Club Captain
John Shepherd—Judo Club
These awards were made to
the above for their outstanding
contributions to the College in
their respective fields.

Union meeting (cont.)
After the warm up by the .
ACC, the best turn came, direct
from the Ham. Soc, Laughing
Don Pearson. After his cus-
tomary " Mr. President, Sir,"
came the slow build up to various
hackneyed gags. Politics are
always good for a laugh, so the
one about the Conservative Party
membership being up by 30 per
cent, was a big hit. More was
to come—the Reds have decided
: to liquidate the old Marxist
Forum and to form a Communist
j Society. The joke wore a bit thin
! with the rehash of NUS. Most
people had already heard it all
to drop that one and look for
another gem in his depleted bag.
I Then Don read out the aims and
objects of the newly-formed Flat
Earth Society, starting with visits
to the four corners of the Earth,
trips in flying saucers, finally re-
ducing the already helpless audi-
ence to laughing chaos with the
punch line, " Safety precautions
for ships sailing off the edge of
the world." Laughing Don had
scored a big hit, and this was ac-
knowledged by " compere "
Chandmal.
The next turn was the Haclin
production of a take-off of the
Kenneth Home show " Beyond
the Understanding." "The Square
Dancing Society is finding its
feet" started the groaning, but
was soon topped by the one
about the Riding Club hav
ing more horses than mem-
bers. Not an outstanding
script, but it had its moments.
Obviously he had worked hard,
and again the compere reminded
us of this.
While all this was going on, the
elections for Council Reps were
also being held ; the results were
such that Dave Loftus could vote
twice for himself at Joint Coun-
cil, while Norman Price will be
able to play ball on next year's
Council. Then on with the next
act, presumably a gap-stopper
before the big moment when the
compere could get in the act him
self. The Carnival produced a
great deal of money and odd
references to Bristol by John
Madison. A good straight act,
performed quite smoothly. The
best job was the one behind the
scenes—Mrs. Rob had counted
the money.
Now came the delicate, subtle
oriental Chandmal. Comedy
laced with serious rubbish—and
he got away with it. The man is
mystery. Where did he get that
one about the Phoenix rising
from the Ashes ? " Soho Print
ing " was perhaps a little crude
but he made up for this with a
monetary joke. £14,000 are
needed to pay for the increased
costs of the new refectories.
This was accompanied by
superb aphorism, splendidly ac
claimed : " Drinkers should not
subsidise eaters." The President
thanked his front-man, PRO
expert J.B., and moved on with
the humour. " Prominent
figures are always good for a
laugh, and compare Chandmal
produced a superb character,
called the Domestic Bursar. It
appears that this man has a ten-
dency to spend his time at a place
called " the Catering Sub-Com-
mittee," waiting for something to
turn down, occasionally provid-
ing comic relief when caught out
wallowing in the puddles of an
afterthought.
One of the backstage men took
the stand now, to thank the com-
pere for the good job that he
had managed through the year,
no doubt with the aid of many
timely speeches. Heads nodded
in agreement, and Mr. Liddle
sat down. Mr. Chandmal
had not quite finished yet,
though—he still had to announce
the names of those elected to the
Entertainments Committee. This
one misfired, because he read out
the list of people with least votes
to start with, but was soon cor-
rected by one of the gentlemen
who had counted the votes. The
correct names were read out to
applause from the crowd. That
was great staging and a fitting
climax to the show. You must
see it again next year—its a wow.

a pinch of salt.
Communist Society
At last the old Marxist Forum
has been scrapped and a Com-
munist Society formed. The
Society has a long pedigree, from
the early days when after the
proposed Society was turned
down in 1952, the Marxist sub-
group was formed as an offshoot
of the Lit. and Deb. Soc. After
the old RCCcumSCC was split
UP and the SCC took on a
liberal" image, the sub-group
was allowed to become the inde-
pendent Marxist Forum.
The latest change is in a nut-
shell, out of the armchairs and
into the streets, from a purely
theoretical Society into a thor-
ough-going political Society. This
is necessary as it is recognised
that mere preaching will not
change society, but through poli-
tical activity it is possible to
change the world from capitalism
and war to peace and socialism.
At the same time political acti-
vity needs to be concentrated on
short term objectives, e.g., for a
real change in student housing,
from poor digs and few hostels to
more student controlled hostels
and student flats, and for student
controlled lodgings lists to ensure
good conditions and to have more
power over landladies who refuse
to take in coloured students.
The Society is interested in
spreading Marxist ideas and in
bringing to an end exploitation
and the rat race. All those of
you who agree with these objec-
tives are urged to join the Society
and make your protest more
effective, your ideals more tan-
gible.
