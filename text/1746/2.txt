International Women’s Day: A
Tribute
or you Tena-
cious D fans
out there, I want
you to know:
yes, I was very tempted
to write a bastardised
version of their lyrics for
this article, based on the
title. I thought, however,
that might undermine the
message. A pity, for sure.
This year, International
Women’s Day falls on a
Sunday – which is awfully
inconvenient for us trying
to provide coverage, as
we publish on a Friday.
I decided to split the
conversation over this
issue and the next. I’ve
written this editorial this
week, and next week we
will feature an extensive
Throwback section.
That section will
feature a fascinating range
of stories on women at
Imperial, that we discov-
ered in the Felix archives
during the Union’s Diving
into Imperial’s HerStory
event, which we hosted
down in the office this
past Monday. Credit goes
to Yani up at the Union
for putting that together,
and to Jia Qi Tan, one of
our Books and TV editors
- two women who put a
good deal of effort into
recognising the women in
our community.
On the back of that, I
was inspired to write a
little tribute to the women
in my life here.
Firstly, a bit of the
history of IWD: it truly is
an international story. The
March 8th date was origi-
nally proposed in 1910 by
Clara Zetkin, a German
revolutionary (according
to Wikipedia), who was
inspired by a Women’s
Day in New York by the
Socialist Part of America
in 1909. The first to pick
it up as a national holiday
was, unsurprisingly given
its origin, Soviet Russia in
1917 – and this adoption
actually was driven by a
city-wide demonstration
by women textile workers
in Petrograd, which con-
stituted a major moment
in the overall Russian
Revolution.
IWD remained pre-
dominantly a communist
holiday until 1967, when
it was picked up by
second-wave feminists
– returning to its roots as
a catalyst for activism. Al-
though in the modern day,
it has been corporatised
to an extent, suffering the
same fate as many other
social causes under the
current commercialised
climate, it remains a pow-
erful symbol for change.
Weirdly, reading up
about all this, I was re-
minded of several of the
women in my life: namely
my mother, as well as her
mother and her sister – my
grandmother and aunt.
They are each matriarchs
of their zones, staunch
feminists, and shaped me
immensely growing up.
They each also lived in
many countries, experi-
encing truly international
lives – and in particular
ones that threw into sharp
relief the varied experi-
ences of women around
the globe.
In particular, the stories
my mother and aunt have
of living in Saudi Arabia
as children are fascinat-
ing, and I think helped to
shape their perspective on
women’s rights at a young
age.
I love my family, but I
don’t want this to be about
sentimentality, or to turn
it into being about me and
myrelationshipwiththem.
So forgive me for glossing
over that part. Suffice to
say that I think are the
perfect representatives of
what feminism should be.
Self-assured, confident
women who have each
achieved very highly and
attuned much wisdom in
their lives, and who raised
me and my brother to be
feminists by empathy and
understanding rather than
by doctrine.
My grandmother on
my father’s side has,
without delving into her
or my personal life too
much, taught me much
about both generosity
and strength in life – and
all the varied forms this
can take, outside of the
male-dominated one we
are constantly presented
with via every form of
media and social condi-
tioning one could imagine.
Of course, as I grew
older, other women
entered my life – in par-
ticular, my partner.
Well, what can I say
without making it all
about me, and without
getting all sentimental.
She’s awesome; strength
and kindness, independ-
ence and the act of sharing
a life with another, and
she's all the feelings that
come with that incarnate.
She’d kick ass with or
without me in her life, so
I’m just happy to be along
for the ride. She’s what
the modern world allows
women to be – and what
we should keep fighting to
ensure the next generation
can be.
In writing this, I’ve
found that it can be
difficult to talk about
what makes each of these
people paragons of all the
positive aspects of wom-
anhood without referring
to myself and my relation-
ship with them. I thought
I’d add a little addendum
to this article discussing
this.
I feel like this is a trap
that many men in this
scenario – or, indeed,
people in general in other
scenarios – fall into. We
are all locked within the
silos of our own minds,
and it can be hard to think
about others outside of the
confining boundaries of
our own experiences with
them.
But doing that inherent-
ly diminishes one’s point,
sometimes. It doesn’t make
a person kind to be nice to
you specifically, and if one
thinks about everything in
those terms it is very easy
to miss the point. Empathy
breeds understanding,
and you can’t empathise
by bringing the women in
your life into your world.
You have to step into theirs
to understand them, their
issues, their perspectives,
and their lives.
I have no foolproof
method for achieving this.
It’s a universal problem
that, in many ways, we all
live and die alone, inside
our own minds. At the risk
of sounding like a moron,
that’s why ‘The Matrix’
works as a concept. But
it’s something to remem-
ber and strive for.
