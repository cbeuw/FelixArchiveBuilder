The Past is Out to Get You!
T
here is a certain
expectation in
the air, when you
choose to spend
the leap day viewing a
play, as opposed to the
various other things that
your non-existent social
life would have liked you
to indulge in. This expec-
tation is only heightened,
when you learn that the
play is an adaptation of
Henrik Ibsen’s Ghosts and
that it is being staged in
the tiny Meeting Room 5
in Union building. While
the former was enticing
enough, the opportunity
to see a play intimately
staged in a room that can
at best accommodate 25
people, was an offer I
could not refuse.
Ghosts, when it first
premiered in 1882, was
met with controversy
and outright disdain.
Perhaps because many
of the social themes ad-
dressed, including incest
and extra-martial affairs,
were in hindsight a touch
too progressive for the
time. The play follows
widow Helen Alving,
played in this adaptation
by a singular Nan Fletch-
er-Lloyd, as she struggles
to come to terms with her
past, which unravels itself
in the most unfortunate of
circumstances, hurting all
around her.
The production is
heavily reliant on acting
prowess and in this
instance, did not disap-
point. The tiny room was
astutely adapted to seat
the sizable audience while
providing a spacious and
well decorated set for the
actors. The set design and
lighting, given the close
quarters, deserves par-
ticular credit, faithfully
transforming yet another
unimaginative piece of
uniquely Imperial archi-
tecture into a convincing
English residence.
The members of the
small cast each gave
organic performances,
holding back at the right
time and capturing the
stage in their moment.
The chilling exchange
between Helen Alving
(Lloyd) and Catherine
Manders (Sandrine
Chausson) leading up
to the end of Act 1 is
certainly the highlight of
the play. Other notable
performances include
Max Davies’s tragic por-
trayal of Oswald Alving
losing his grasp on reality
towards the end of the
play and Jesidhn Pillai’s
convincingly cunning
performance as Jacob
Engrand.
The adaptation
managed to capture the
depth of despair reflected
in Isben’s original work
while bringing a certain
contemporary flavour
to the events and the
dialogue.
Though not as contro-
versial today as it once
was,theproductionproves
yet again that the play if
staged with the right set
of talent on and off stage
is quite capable of capti-
vating modern audiences.
The strained accents and
patchy sound work not-
withstanding, this was an
amazing performance put
forth against great odds;
one that deserved better in
every way, from a larger
production budget to a
bigger audience and more
importantly, a prolonged
standing ovation at the
end.
