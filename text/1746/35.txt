Emerging Markets vs Developed Markets
internally within the
community (known as a
subsistence economy),
people’s main goal shifted
towards profiting by
sale of those goods. The
type and sophistication
of goods sold increased
steadily over time, from
agricultural products to
more complex machinery
and to the modern service
sector.
However, not all econo-
mies advanced at the same
pace, which resulted in a
development gap arising
between them. There were
many root-causes of such
segregation, ranging from
political in(dependence)
of a certain country to its
geographical location.
Regardless of the reasons
behind this, the present
result is clear enough –
there is a group of ‘devel-
oped’ countries, and the
rest that are trying to catch
up with them. Economists
still argue about the exact
list of ‘developed’ coun-
tries, but most agree on
about twenty-five of them,
which include most of
Western Europe, Northern
European countries,
U.S.A, Canada, South
Korea and several more.
So which unique qualities
contribute to the sorting
of developed economies
from the emerging ones?
Again, there are no strict
criteria’s for that, but
usually the following key
factors are taken into
consideration:
1. Gross domestic
product (GDP) per capita:
the total worth of goods
being produced inside a
country per its population
size.
2. High standards of
living: usually measured
via the United Nations’
Human Development
Index
3. Well-run stock
market – in terms of
number of trades being
executed daily, its li-
quidity and the range of

4. (Mostly) Free trade
– a bit of an ‘optional’
criteria, which implies
almost full absence of
trade tariffs (this ‘rule’
is quite often violated
nowadays, evident by the
U.S.-China trade war)
Focusing on any
singular criteria hardly
paints an accurate image.
For example, a country
rich in natural resources
may have an abnormally
high GDP per capita and
thus be considered a de-
veloped country if judged
solely on the first crite-
rion. Instead, all factors
should be considered
simultaneously, to build a
holistic assessment of the
country’s development.
At this juncture, it
could be misguided
to think that emerging
economies are just a more
politically correct way of
saying ‘under-developed’.
Despite a degree of truth
in that label, emerging
markets remain hugely
attractive for potential
investments, and the main
reason behind that are the
returns, which are unseen
in developed markets.
The underlying cause is
simple–it is much easierto
grow when your economy
is still not ‘saturated’ and
there is still room for
expansion. Simultane-
ously, this higher growth
rate also comes with
higher volatility, which
is, in turn, linked with a
higher risk of losses for
investors. It may also be
easily observed that while
countries in the developed
group are similar in terms
of economies, those in the
emerging category can
vary quite a lot. There
are several sub-parties
within this segment. To
begin with, all emerging
countries could be split up
into frontier and regular
emerging markets, with
the former still at a lower
stage of development.
Moreover, many countries
with similar economic
structures are grouped
into a single category, a
famous example is the
so-called ‘BRIC’ (which
combines Brazil, Russia,
India and China, and
was especially popular
in the early 2000-s for
its extremely fast pace
of growth). Another one

what exactly do these

This article is dedicated to
getting the reader’s head
around these widely used
labels.
First, let’s jump into
a short (and rather sim-
plistic) history of the
world economy. Since
the beginning of the 16th
century, capitalism started
to develop in Western
Europe and gradually
spread across the globe.
This meant that, instead of
