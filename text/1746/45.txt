The skin of your ene-

Leather is really in right
now and as long as your
security keeps the pesky
animal protest people
away you will really wow
the crowd. Pro tip: anger
some gingers for that
extra special I need to put
suncream on my trousers
look.
Plastic bags
Want to show how
much you care for the
planet and the oceans by
wearing plastic clothes?
The new Gucci plastic
collection gets the best
oil and refines it specially
to make long lasting chic
clothes. Unfortunately
a local air-conditioning
unit is required as well
to prevent the wearer
sweating to death. Who
said fashion comes cheap?
Baby seal pelts
For a great corporate
weekend away go and
club the seals yourself!
With a spa and a duty free
shop at the resort this one
is sure to please your em-
ployees. With clubbing in
the morning, you can fit in
a team building exercise
over lunch before going
into the workshops for
classes on skinning and
sewing lead by genuine
Inuits! Embroidery of
the company logo is also
available for extra.
Congolese cotton
Congolese cotton is the
name of the new material
that fashionistas in the
city are going mad for.
Made completely out of
conflict diamonds this one
is sure to impress. After
all, no one else is buying
them so get them while
they are still cheap!
