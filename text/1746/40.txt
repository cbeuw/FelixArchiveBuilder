H
ave you ever
looked around
campus and felt
like, despite
being an international
university in the heart of
London, there’s virtually
no diversity here at all?
We deﬁnitely have. On
our respective courses
(medicine, bioengineering
and mechanical engineer-
ing), Black students in
particular are a minority
within the minority of
students of colour. It’s not
just the shockingly low
numbers of Black and
minority ethnic (BAME)
students at Imperial that
warrants discussion, but
the wider issue of race
in academia that we as
Liberation & Community
Ofﬁcers (LCOs) hope to
address.
You may have heard of
the ‘Decolonise the curric-
ulum’ campaign. Inspired
by the Rhodes Must Fall
protests in South Africa,
the campaign calls for
universities to include
more BAME academics
in their curricula. We have
heard countless times that
Imperial, being a STEM
university, is immune to
academic racism and other
biases, rendering race
an irrelevant issue that
only affects humanities.
It’s this narrow view that
has, in part, contributed
to the underrepresentation
of BAME students at
Imperial.
Race impacts your
is also very low relative to
London’s Black popula-
tion. As the College aims
to increase admission
of BAME students, it
must also consider its
responsibility to give
those students equal
opportunities to ﬂourish
once they arrive. This
includes responding to
BAME students’ reports
of alienation that are
reﬂected in the numbers.
The ways in which we
are taught the history of
science and technology at
Imperial often centre on
Western discoveries and
innovations and ignore the
meaningful contribution
of scientists from other
parts of the world, past
and present. Decolonising
is about rethinking, re-
places of intellectual con-
frontation; students should
be taught to challenge
the canon and consider
alternatives from different
cultural perspectives.
We want to stress that
talking about race is
to inform, not attack. De-
colonising the curriculum
is not about completely
eliminating white men
from our lectures. It’s
about identifying the
omissions in our teaching
that limit our understand-
ing of science. Including
BAME academics isn’t
just a token act of toler-
ance; deconstructing these
biases will make us better
clinicians, scientists and
engineers.
Curriculum decol-
onisation requires a
sustained commitment
to identifying and chal-
lenging colonial systems
and structures. It needs
the commitment of both
students and staff, BAME
and non-BAME alike. So,
we’re starting a conversa-
tion about race at Imperial
and we want your input.
In the last week of term
(March 16th-20th) we’re
hosting the Decolonis-
ing the Curriculum at
Imperial launch event to
allow students and staff
to express their views on
what needs to change.
This will be alongside a
range of panel discussions
and other events intended
to celebrate our diversity
and seek solutions to dis-
crimination in academia.
Watch this space for
venue conﬁrmation!

ing evening targeted at

from each Faculty will

improve the curricula.

contributions of Black
Muslims, a group at
the intersection of two
minority identities.
The College is also
keen to change how
race and racism operate
within our cultures and
structures. Take part in a
Race and Equality Charter
(REC) focus group on
Wednesday 18th March
(Group 1: 13:00–14:30
or Group 2: 15:00–16:30)
which is open to all Black,
Asian and Minority Ethnic
students at Imperial to tell
the College about your
experience of studying
here, the good and the
bad. If we don’t speak
up about the problems, it
is unlikely anything will
change or get better. This
is a golden opportunity to
talk about issues affect-
ing you in a safe space.
Your input will provide
valuable information on
the student experience and
will shape the Action Plan
formulated to address the
issues raised.
Participation is
entirely conﬁdential - no
Imperial College staff
are involved in running
the focus groups. The
facilitators include
David Woodger, Head
of Community Studies
and a Lecturer in Social
Science, Community
Development and Youth
Work at Goldsmiths,
University of London.
His research area is race
and racism with a focus
that enables professionals
and managers to critically
reﬂect on practice, policy
and interventions tackling
institutional racism. Lara
Paquete Pereira will also
facilitate; she is a Youth
& Community Worker
and anti-racism activist,
having been involved
with the recent anti-rac-
ism student occupation
GARA (Goldsmiths
Anti-Racism Action).
She is part of several an-
ti-racism working groups
at Goldsmiths, University
of London, having a voice
in shaping mandatory
anti-racism training for
staff at the university. The
facilitators will provide an
anonymised report to the
REC Equality Self-As-
sessment Team. To partic-
ipate, please contact the
