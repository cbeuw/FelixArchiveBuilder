Is the College’s Socially Responsible
Investment Policy Green Washing?
College decides to quit investments in tobacco, but fails to kick dependence on fossil fuels and
arms
COMMENT

A
t first glance
the college’s
announcement
of its Socially
Responsible Investment
(SRI) strategy this
Monday seems positive,
with policies on its invest-
ments into tobacco, arms
and fossil fuels. There is
good news and there is
bad news. The bad news –
it has decided to continue
ties with fossil fuel and
arms companies, and
has failed to define clear
quantitative targets or
time frames. The way the
policy is loosely worded
draw concerns over
whether there will be real
change, and responses to
emails suggest the college
is already going back even
on these policies.
The good news is that
the College has decided
to stop all investments
into tobacco companies,
including withdrawal
of indirect investments,
such as through invest-
ment funds. Divestment
from tobacco will not
only benefit Imperial’s
conscience, it will benefit
wider society - the cost of
smoking-related diseases
to the NHS was £2.6 bn
in 2015. Another com-
mendable step the college
has taken is to pledge
that its fund managers
will become a signatories
to the UN Principles of
Responsible Investment,
which is underpinned by
six guidelines for invest-
ment.
Unfortunately it is not
all good news. Thermal
coal and tar sands are
some of the most polluting
fossil fuels. BP, Shell and
Chevron all continue to
engage in their extraction.
Chevron, which employs
Imperial’s president Alice
Gast, has recently opened
up a new tar sands project
in Venezuela. In the
announcement emailed to
all members the college,
it was announced that
the College will “divest
from direct and indirect
investments in companies
engaged in these activities
[coal and tar sands]”. Yet
in an informal clarifica-
tion from the Provost in
response to a request for
clarification, made availa-
ble by Divest Imperial, he
allegedly stated that the
college would not be di-
vesting from BP, Chevron,
or Shell, claiming that
the policy only applies
to organisations “whose
sole business is coal or
tar sands”. This explicitly
goes against the policy
which members of the
public would read, and
this treatment of its
policies if true, can at best
be described greenwash-
ing by the college.
Furthermore, it is not
clear how the college
will treat non-financial
ties and avoid locking
graduates into career
paths in fossil-fuel
extraction which have
limited future prospects.
The College suggests that
it will affect companies,
among other means,
through its “influence as
a world-leading univer-
sity” and its “educational
programmes”. Call me
naive, but I believe letting
companies whose primary
purpose is to extract fossil
fuels have easy-access to
graduates and influence
which skills are taught at
the highest impact uni-
versties in the world does
not seem congruent with
a carbon neutral world.
Not because people who
work at such companies
are uninformed or evil,
because they aren’t, but
because they are obliged
by the a broken system to
spend their days as cogs in
a machine that is driving
unprecedented damage
to climate. As much as
we need investment in
education, we also need
freedom for people with
the skills and creativity
to make renewables into
a reality at the immense
scale required. Teaching
students skills to extract
fossil fuels and hosting
career fairs with large
fossil fuel companies
gives students a distorted
picture of where their
talent can be applied.
College has decided to
“divest from arms manu-
facturers who manufac-
ture illegal weapons”. At
first glance this seems like
a good policy, but read it
again. Illegal? Unless the
college has, until now,
been investing into illegal
weapons such as biolog-
ical weaponry or prolif-
eration of nuclear arms,
this policy is barely worth
the paper it is written on
because few companies
involved in illegal arms
manufacturing would
publicise it. From a recent
freedom of information
request, we know that
the college invests into
Lockhead Martin, the
largest arms manufacturer
in the US and which
went though a number of
bribery scandals in the
1950s - 1970s. Lockhead
Martin in the UK manu-
factures Trident nuclear
warheads loaded on
submarines. Rather than
relying on the government
to ascertain which invest-
ments are permitted, the
College should be decide
itself whether investments
into instruments designed
to kill is socially respon-
sible.
Given how loosely
worded the statement is,
as well as failing to set
targets for which it can be
held accountable, it is yet

panies that hedge their
bets on CCS sometime in
the future to justify explo-
ration of new oil fields is
not a socially responsible
investment strategy.
The SRI policy has
opened up engagement
in a way we appreciate
and is a step in the right
direction, but it is journey
that is far from over. The
college asserts it will reg-
ularly review the policy
and its investments, which
is also one of the key
components of the UN
Principles of Responsible
Investment, however it
has yet to define the
timeframe for these. It
should also be consistent
