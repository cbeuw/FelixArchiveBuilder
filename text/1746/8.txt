of their people, rootedin
their different history.
Different attitudes from
these two regions would
probably even be present
in the case of a hypothet-
ical disaster: “If Beijing
gave money to Macau
after a typhoon hit Macau,
people would be grateful,
if Beijing gave money to
Hong Kong, people would
complain. They would
say you are trying to get
something out of us”. A
different behaviour with
respect to the two reali-
ties is shown also by the
authorities. On this note,
Prof. Carroll told me an
interesting anecdote: “If
you go to Macau today,
you can see a small body
of water that divides
Macau from Zhuhai. I
once asked a government
ofﬁcial: don’t you worry
about people swimming
over to escape? He said:
why do they need to
swim? They can just walk
over. It doesn’t really
matter”.
Hong Kong people, on
the other hand, are very
worried about immigra-
tion and the arrival of an
overwhelming number of
individuals with pro-Bei-
jing views.
The protests
Another interesting
question to address, due
to its potential devel-
opments, is that of the
recent protests in HK, the
Umbrella Movement of
2014 and those sparked by
the proposed Extradition
Bill of last year.
While the 2014 protests
lasted for around two
months before evaporat-
ing, without obtaining any
of the democratic reforms
they sought, the 2019 ones
lasted much longer. They
continued indeed until the
Coronavirus emergency
hit the city. Prof. Carroll
opinion is that once this
exceptional situation will
be over, the protests will
actually resume, due to
several reasons.
Firstly, unlike the
Umbrella Movement,
these protests have been
characterised by extreme-
ly harsh ﬁghts between
the protesters and the
police. The dispropor-
tionate violence exercised
by the police force was
worse than even that of
the 1967 protests, and
for that reason he thinks
that the police have never
been hated as much as
they are as now. This
attitude towards the police
and exacerbation of the
repression was also men-
tioned by Lord Patten in
his lecture last February.
Secondly, this emer-
gency, although momen-
tarily halting protests, has
increased the dissatisfac-
tion of Hong Kong people
towards the government.
People think indeed that
the borders with China
have been closed too late,
facilitating the spread
of the virus, and that the
government did not act
sufﬁciently to limit the
“His opinion is that once this
exceptional epidemic situation
is over, the protests will
resume”
price of face masks and
other goods now deemed
important. To the question
of whether Beijing will
still have faith in Carrie
Lam as Chief Executive
of Hong Kong, Prof.
Carroll replied that there
is no way to know. The
internal matters of the
Chinese Communist Party
are secret to the extent that
we don’t even know how
many times Mrs Lam goes
to mainland China. Right
now, Hong Kong people
don’t want to renounce
their desire of a more
democratic system, while
on the other side Beijing
doesn’t want to give in to
them, therefore a way in
which the situation could
be resolved is not foresee-
able.
Personal experiences
As my interlocutor was
born in the 60s in Hong
Kong and was brought up
there, I thought it would
be noteworthy to ask him
about his relationship
with the place. He told me
that, although he had been
invited to the handover

ceremony, he could not
attend because he was
in the United States for
personal reasons. He
nonetheless watched it
on TV and found it quite
emotional, and that while
it was the ultimate concre-
tisation of decolonisation,
it was not perceived so at
the time.
Looking back,
however, he believes
Hong Kong’s decolo-
nisation has been the
most successful to have
occurred. This is because
it was planned 13 years
ahead and occurred in an
a very smooth fashion,
maintaining for instance
their same laissez-faire
economical system. The
opposite scenario took
place in India, where de-
colonisation was pushed
through in the summer of
1947 and was followed by
an unstable international
situation in that region
of Asia. Furthermore,
people who worked for
the British began simply
to work for the Chinese,
without accusations of
collaboration which led
to summary executions as
in other colonies. Nobody
could accuse anybody
else of that, because they
all worked for the same
people.
Concerning the recent
protests, I asked him
whether he felt worried
that some of his students
could have been there,
risking their lives. He
replied that he was indeed
worried, even if the
students of his faculty
were not as involved in the
protests as those of other
faculties, e.g. Law. While
now, because of corona-
virus, lecturers can only
teach online, he is worried
about what will happen
when the normal schedule
resumes. This political
situation would indeed
see a further polarisation
in the universities, where
students may be involved
in the protests on one
hand, and on the other the
mainland community may
face discrimination by HK
students. The important
thing, Prof. Carroll states,
is to guarantee a safe en-
vironment for all students
independent of their back-
ground and that academic
freedom remains as vital
as it is today..
Some reflections
Having been given this
wonderful insight into
the issue I consider as
Asia’s most singular and
interesting city, I was only
encouraged to further
explore its history and all
its faces. What is most
shocking is that in Hong
Kong almost every year
an era seems to have come
to an end, and another
seems about to begin. One
occurred in 1997 with
the handover, one seems
to happen each time a
cycle of protest begins,
one will probably take
place in 2047, when Hong
Kong’s status as a Special
Administrative Region
will expire. This would be
an end, or more poetically
a twilight, like that in
“Twilight in the Forbid-
den City”, sinologist Sir
Reginald Johnston’s book
about China’s last years
as an empire. I hope that
the people of Hong Kong,
some of whom I had the
luck to meet, will not be
left with an unbearable
sense of alienation after-
wards. I think, however,
that for many of them
this possibility is already
being actualised.
A special thanks goes to
Professor John Carroll
for the marvellous conver-
sation we had and to The
Rt Hon. The Lord Patten
of Barnes for sending me
his recent lecture.
