Plastics are bad, but switching to paper is worse
P
lastics are created
by the devil, those
nonbiodegradable
monsters will
infiltrate every corner
of the planet in varying
sizes, from nanoparticles
in your body to giant mu-
tated blobs that colonize
landfills. When you try to
kill it with fire, they spew
poisonous gases, and
when you cut them, they
become more numerous,
but are never destroyed.
Plastics have certainly
been demonized in the
media, and images of
plastics in the oceans and
stuck on animals are stuck
in our minds.
You would be right-
fully concerned about
plastic damaging the
environment, but many
of our first instincts are to
immediately switch from
plastic to using paper or
other types of packaging.
Now that is not such a
great idea, and this article
will go in detail to explain
why.
Now when thinking
about why we might want
to use paper instead of
plastic, the main reason is
that plastic is not biode-
gradable, while paper is…
or is it? Here is the thing,
many people are not
aware that although paper
is biodegradable, it needs
the correct conditions.
According to the Environ-
mental Protection Agency
(EPA) paper takes just as
long as plastic to break
down in landfills. There
is however the advantage
that paper will much more
likely be recycled, and
never end up in a landfill,
furthermore, paper can
be recycled an infinite
amount of times, while
for plastic it is limited.
This is also an advantage
for other materials such
as glass and metals over
plastic.
Here is the thing,
there is also a significant
disadvantage of energy
usage when you compare
any material to plastic.
It is estimated that paper
bags take four time as
much energy than plastic
bags to manufacture and
use twenty times as much
water. From this perspec-
tive paper is much worse.
Furthermore, in the case
of bags you can reuse
plastic bags many times,
as they are very durable,
paper bags are less likely
to last a long time.
Paper being better
for the environment is a
common misconception,
and it is because we never
question how bad paper
is for the environment.
With plastic always being
slammed in the media,
we wrongly assume that
every other material is
better. In reality, as with
every environmental
issue, we should do our
own research before
deciding on anything.
In reality, switching
to paper is worse for
the environment, and
companies are doing
this for greenwashing.
Erasing consumer guilt is
a strategy to make people
spend more money. It is
definitely not a sustainable
initiative, instead it is an
initiate to seem sustaina-
ble. Look at brands such a
is very powerful and
important, and we should
all try and incorporate it
into our lives, wherever
possible. The main lesson
I learnt from zero-waste
is to consume more
consciously, and think

Plastics are painted as the ultimate villain in the environment world, but the truth is of course more complicated
Primark, H&M and Boots
who have adopted paper
bags, while polluting the
planet with the products
they sell in those paper
bags (and those products
are probably made from
polyester or wrapped in
plastic).
The solution would
be to not use single-use
packaging. Plastic is a
durable material and can
make wonderful things
that can be used for years,
it is only when it becomes
a single use item that it
becomes problematic.
We should all aspire to
stay away from all-things
single use, whether plastic
or paper, but of course
that is more easily said
than done. As someone
who has attempted a
zero-waste lifestyle, I’ve
got to be honest and say
it is not compatible with
being a busy ass Imperial
student. However, I’ve
learnt over time that the
movement is not about
being a perfectionist, and
we should each do what
we can. I believe that the
central philosophy to the
zero-waste movement
about everything you
buy, whether you really
need it, and on top of the
economic cost for you,
what are the externalities
and costs to the planet and
others. Secondly, another
important lesson is that
reducing, and reusing are
the most powerful sustain-
able day-to-day practices
you can have. Recycling
is good in theory, but in
reality, companies only
recycle if it is profitable,
for example, only 9% of
plastic bottles actually get
recycled.
Of course, the respon-
sibility shouldn’t fall
all upon the consumer’s
shoulders, the government
should start pressuring
companies to abolish the
unsustainable practice of
over packaging and make
unpackaged produce
more readily available
to everyone. This is the
only way forward to make
change on a bigger scale.
In conclusion,
whenever you next
see cutlery made from
bamboo, or bags made
from paper, please
remember that they are to
help with consumer guilt,
and not the environment.
Single use packaging is
wasteful and unsustaina-
ble no matter the material.
So, if you truly want to
save the planet, bring
your own lunchbox and
cutlery to Fusion next
time, I don’t care if it’s
plastic. Another point I
hope you learn from this
article is that everything
has an environmental
cost, and sustainability
choices are not always
straight forward, meaning
that intuition is not the
way to go. The world is
full of misinformation,
and it is best to do your
own research and spread
awareness to others.
