It’s a New Dawn, it’s a New Day, it’s a New…Planet?
How About Seventeen!

includes a rare ‘Earth-like’ candidate

N
ot one, but
seventeen new
planets outside
our solar
system have been dis-
covered by astronomy
PhD student Michelle
Kunimoto. Her find
adds both a possible
‘Goldilocks’ candidate
to the current ‘exoplanet’
catalogue, and one that
claims the title of the 16th
smallest on that 4126-long
list.
Capitalising on data
gathered by NASA’s
Keplar missions, which
explore the universe,
searching for planets
outside of our solar
system, Kunimoto
analysed information
spanning almost 200,000
stars. She used the transit
method to identify these
exoplanets, a technique
which monitors light
patterns around stars to
determine if they are
interrupted by an orbiting
body, such as a planetary
candidate.
“Every time a planet
passes in front of a star,
it blocks a portion of that
star’s light and causes a
temporary decrease in the
star’s brightness,” said
Kunimoto, who studies at
the University of British
Columbia in Canada. “By
finding these dips, known
as transits, you can start
to piece together informa-
tion about the planet, such
as its size and how long it
takes to orbit.”
The transit discovery
method is one of several
that can be used to
identify planets – and it
is one of the most fruitful,
with over 3,100 exoplan-
ets confirmed using this
approach alone. The next
bountiful approach, the
radial velocity method,
can only claim around
700 exoplanets, watching
instead for a change in the
starlight wavelength that
orbiting planets cause.
However, Kunimoto
took a different approach
to previous Kepler
analyses. “My search
looked for planets with
slightly lower signal-
to-noise-ratios - weaker
indications of planets
- than the Kepler team
and many previous inde-
pendent searches.” Unlike
the Kepler analysis,
Kunimoto applied a
Box-Least Squares (BLS)
algorithm to the Kepler
data with an associated
signal-to-noise (S/N)
ratio to sift the significant
results from background
noise, rather than Kepler’s
wavelength-based algo-
rithm with its Multiple
Event Statistics (MES)
detection method. The
BLS algorithm allowed
her to lower the noise
floor, set at an S/N value
of > 6 compared with
the Kepler MES ratio of
7.1. “This improved my
pipeline’s sensitivity to
candidates that are both
small and have long
orbital periods.”
And it paid off with
the discovery of KIC-
11350118c, which
measures in at just slightly
bigger than Mars and is
one of the smallest to be
identified – the sixteenth
smallest identified from
the Kepler data so far. But
it wasn’t as easy as all that
sounds; Kunimoto’s initial
analysis found 130,312
signals that met the S/N
criteria, which needed to
be whittled down to those
final 17 planets, by sub-
jecting them to a barrage
of vetting procedures,
digital and manual, to
discard the false positives.
Kunimoto also teamed
up with a UBC alumni,
Henry Ngo, to use
Near InfraRed imaging
captured by the Gemini
North telescope in Hawaii
on the stars of interest.
By taking high-resolution
adaptive optics images of
the stars, Kunimoto had
the resolution to differ-
entiate between clusters
of stars and individual
light sources, something
the Kepler data, taken
with a lower resolution
telescope, could not do.
This allowed her to rule
out false positive transit
signals, like those from
eclipsing binary stars
– a set of two stars that
appear, at low resolution,
as a single point of light,
but can eclipse each other
and mistakenly be read as
a transit signal like that of
an orbiting planet.
Something of a veteran
planet hunter, Kunimoto
has already notched up
four planet discoveries in
her undergraduate days.
Bringing her total up to
21, the findings, recently
published in The Astro-
nomical Journal, identify
17 new exoplanets – and
one of particular interest.
Catchily named KIC-
7340288b, it joins the
handful of exoplanets
discovered to date that
tick the vital ‘Goldilocks’
boxes; like Earth, based
on its radius, it’s likely
rocky instead of gaseous
(like the gas giant Jupiter),
and also sits within the
habitable zone of its star,
meaning temperatures
that could allow liquid
water at the surface. As
Kunimoto describes it,
“this is a really exciting
find, since there have only
been 15 small, confirmed
planets in the habitable
zone found in Kepler data
so far.”
About 1.5 times the
size of Earth, KIC-
7340288b sits 0.444
astronomical units from
its star (about the distance
of Mercury from the Sun)
and completes an orbit in
just 142.5 Earth days. The
largest of these 17 new ex-
oplanets is eight times the
size of the earth, while at
the other end of the scale,
five measure up smaller
than Earth, rounding up
with KIC-11350118c as
the smallest.
The Kepler mission
was started primarily to
identify more of these
Goldilocks planets.
Kunimoto and her PhD
supervisor hope to
continue using Kunimo-
to’s approach to re-an-
alyse the Kepler census
of current exoplanets,
adding a much-needed
layer of confirmation. In
the future, however, they
want to start drilling into
the data for more than just
confirmation purposes.
“We’ll be estimating
how many planets are
expected for stars with
different temperatures.
A particularly important
result will be finding a
terrestrial habitable zone
planet occurrence rate.”,
explains Professor Jaymie
Matthews, Kunimoto’s
PhD supervisor. “How
many Earth-like planets
are there?”
With data like that,
NASA can optimize
future space surveying
projects, and, importantly,
plan a more targeted
mission to gather data on a
habitable zone exoplanet.
As Kepler gathered data
on very distant stars, once
the occurrence rate for a
habitable zone planet is
known, NASA can judge
the likelihood of finding
one in a much nearer
location – and plan for
that rather than a mission
to a planet thousands of
light years away.
With findings like
these, that mission might
not be all that far, far
away after all.
