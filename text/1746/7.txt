China’s not so
invisible hand in
HK’s affairs
As Prof. Carroll
explains, while this
attitude meant that Lord
Pattern had a very tense
relationship with China
for the ﬁrst years of his
mandate, things then
gradually improved.
This is in stark contrast
with his predecessor and
only other former HK
Governor still alive, Lord
Wilson. He has always
used quieter tones with
respect to China and his
administration has been
generally appreciated by
the PRC. That is why it
is interesting to underline
their differing thoughts
concerning Chinese
meddling in Hong Kong’s
affairs. Lord Wilson has
recently claimed in a
debate in the House of
Lords, that the only overt
violation of the “one
country, two systems”
principle established in the
Joint Declaration has been
the kidnapping of Lee
Bo and other booksellers
in the last decade. On
the ﬂip side, Lord Patten
delivered a lecture at the
beginning of February in
which he afﬁrmed, that
while China was overall
abiding to such princi-
ples until 2012, things
changed when Xi Jinping
becoming Secretary of
Chinese Communist
Party.
After that year, a
meddling campaign had
clearly begun, and it
was that one of the main
reasons that sparked the
2014 and 2019 protests. I
was therefore interested in
Prof. Carroll’s opinion on
these diverging views.
His reply was that most
Hong Kong people do
believe that several forms
of meddling actually
happened, starting even
in the 2000s. However, he
stated that the deﬁnition
of meddling is not easy
to deﬁne as the Joint
Declaration is indeed a
loose agreement, even
though it was the object of
prolonged negotiations. It
was the fruit of a complex
compromise between
the UK and China. The
result, he said, is that
today, in Hong Kong’s
bipolar political scene, the
pro-democracy camp says
that the pro-China camp
“only understands one
country”, and vice versa,
the latter believes that the
former “only understands
two systems”.
The comparison
with Macau
While Hong Kong is
embattled in reﬂections
and deeply shaken by
protests, its most notable
neighbour, Macau,
remained silent. Macau
nonetheless shares a
background of European
colonialism as well. I
was hence interested in
the reason behind this
difference in behaviour.
For addressing this issue
my interlocutor was es-
pecially useful, given the
fact that one of his main
areas of interest, along
with HK’s history, is colo-
nialism in Asia.
He explained to me
how the political structure
of Macau was very differ-
ent to that of Hong Kong.
Indeed, it was created by
the Portuguese to serve
as a commercial outpost
and was not even a colony
until the late 19th Century.
There, Chinese judges
retained their role and
local authorities remained
very inﬂuential: in other
words, it was a type of
colony the British did not
want to emulate when
establishing Hong Kong
after the First Opium War.
When in 1974 the
Carnation Revolution
brought an abrupt end to
the fascist regime which
was ruling over Portugal,
they began the process of
decolonisation. Although
formally relinquishing
the sovereignty of Macau
to China, Portugal was
encouraged by China to
maintain the administra-
tion of it for some time
whilst it negotiated the
restitution of Hong Kong.
Then after the Joint Dec-
laration was signed, China
came back to the issue of
Macau.
Originally, the PRC
wanted HK and Macau
to be handed over at the
same date, but Portugal
advanced some counter-
proposals. It asked indeed
forMacau tobegivenback
to China in 1999 instead
of 1997 as Hong Kong
was, in order to celebrate
the 250th anniversary of
the acknowledgement by
the Chinese Empire of
Portuguese presence in
China, which occurred in
1749. But then, Portugal
required that a new airport
be built in Macau, that
the Catholic Church be
granted a special status in
the region, and that Por-
tuguese citizenship had
to be given to Macanese
people (i.e. people of
mixed Portuguese and
Asian descent).
China’s initial answer,
Prof. Carroll explained,
was a refusal of all these
requests. China was
indeed already building an
airport in the nearby city
of Zhuhai. It also neither
wanted to concede privi-
leges to the Church, given
its tense relationship with
the Vatican, nor allow a
part of Macau population
to hold a second passport,
since China allows its
citizens to have only one
nationality.
Eventually Portugal
got everything it wanted,
without even having a
Chinese-speaking person
at their Foreign Ofﬁce
at that time. The reason,
Prof. Carroll states, was
probably because of
the Tiananmen Square
massacre and the conse-
quent international isola-
tion China was subjected
to.
Furthermore, a parallel
between Macau and
Hong Kong, he says, is
both useful and useless
at the same time due
also to the size of Macau
(about 600,000 people,
in contrast to the over 7
million of Hong Kong)
and the different attitudes
