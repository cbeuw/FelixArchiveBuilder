Why the world needed Riot Grrrls
The rise of the feminist movement known as Riot Grrrl is thought to be the start of modern day feminism as we
know it - Felix takes a look at a movement which was more punk than actual punk.

P
icture this: it’s
the early 90s
and it’s assumed
that the feminist
movement is over. The
feminists have got what
they wanted, namely
the right to vote and the
expansion of reproductive
rights. They’ve tired
themselves out from dis-
cussing sexual liberality
and so now feminism has
become a scholarly topic,
resigned to discussion
within lecture halls
amongst top academics.
The second wave of fem-
inism, which ushered in
new debates about topics
such as domestic violence,
marital rape and legal ine-
qualities had diminished
and dwindled, until it was
no more. This is the era of
post-feminism.
Picture this: it’s the
early 90s and young punk
women are harassed in a
subculture that has pro-
gressively made it diffi-
cult for them to be part of.
The dregs of punk leftover
from the 70s are now
oppressively macho, with
many women assaulted
at gigs; punk bands
containing women often
don’t succeed as well as
their male counterparts.
One of the most radical
socialist movement to
have existed became
toxic to some of its most
proliferate supporters. So,
these supporters spoke
up, and created a space
to safely speak freely
about being a female punk
rocker: fan zines. These
were DIY leaflets and
“Theuseof“rrr”
was to regain
the meaning of
‘girl’and turn it
into something
that growls
back”
booklets addressing the
culture woman and the
queer community faced
and creating and discuss-
ing their own culture in
response. Notably, Tobi
Vail and Kathleen Hanna,
two women living in
Washington began their
own DIY zine, called
Bikini Kill. They decided,
along with two other
female zine-producers,
that to fully spread their
message to the punk com-
munity, they needed to
express it in the only way
punks really knew how:
through music. Bikini
kill the fan zine became
Bikini Kill the band.
Bikini Kill were soon
joined by more: Bratmo-
bile, Babes in Toyland,
Huggy Bear, 7 Year Bitch,
L7 and Jack Off Jill, to
name a few, were instru-
mental in the newly found
Riot Grrrl movement.
The term Riot Grrrl came
from numerous sources,
but reflected the need for
a “girl riot”, with grrrl
representing firstly the
empowerment of being
a girl before growing up
and having patriarchal
expectations placed upon
them, and secondly the
use of the “rrr”, used to
regain the meaning of the
word into something that
could bite back and growl
at the system. The second
issue of Bikini Kill (the
fan zine) published the
‘riot grrrl manifesto’.
This put into words
what the movement was
acting for and trying to
achieve: “[we] seek to
create revolution in our
own lives every single
day by envisioning and
creating alternatives to
the bullshit capitalist
way of doing things” and
that “we don’t wanna
assimilate to someone
else’s (boy) standards
of what is or isn’t”. The
Riot Grrrl movement of
course took on the punk
philosophy of the DIY
scene, relying only on
themselves and being
self-sufficient. It also
produced its own look,
drawing from the strong
looks of punk culture but
making it unapologetical-
ly feminine to promote
its principles visually.
The Riot Grrrl movement
quickly became its own
subculture, associated
with a particular sound,
style and politics.
The movement dis-
cussed views on issues
revolving around sexual-
ity, rape, domestic abuse
and female empower-
ment. This comes across
strongly in many of the
lyrics of some of the Riot
Grrrl bands, such as in
Bikini Kill’s most famous
song ‘Rebel Girl’: “In
her kiss, I taste the revo-
lution/…They say she’s
a dyke but I know/she is
my best friend yeah”, and
also in L7’s song ‘Pretend
We’re Dead’: “Turn the
tables with our unity/
They neither moral nor
majority/Wake up and
smell the coffee/Or just
say no to individuality”.
The themes Riot Grrrls
discussed were often seen
as unseemly, however
this was (and still is)
the reason for talking
about these issues, as by
highlighting the problem
and then giving women
and the queer community
platforms from which to
share their experiences it
can aid in stopping it from
happening. Often at Riot
Grrrl gigs young women
were given microphones
so they could share their
experiences of sexual
assault to the rest of the
audience in an attempt to
open up the discussion
surrounding these issues.
Kathleen Hanna famously
introduced the ‘girls to the
front’ concept as well, by
encouraging women to the
front and even personally
enforcing the rejection of
men from venues who had
sexually assaulted female
audience members.
Despite the worldwide
media hype around alter-
native rock music in the
northern states at the start
of the 90s (i.e. Nirvana),
Riot Grrrl bands managed
to mostly remain under-
ground, probably due to
their discussion around
difficult issues which
mainstream media did
not want to publish, es-
pecially in a time where
feminism seemed to be
over. The little media at-
tention given to them was
often provoked by picking
up on Riot Grrrl acts but
without mentioning the
why the artist was doing
it, such as writing ‘slut’
on the performing artist’s
body to reclaim the word.
The movement often got
wronglyattributedtosome
bands, such as those who
were non-political or fe-
male-fronted. The media’s
response meant that the
Riot Grrrl movement
didn’t take off worldwide,
and by the mid-90s had
died out, although some
bands kept going such as
Sleater-Kinney. Girl-pow-
er, as promoted by Riot
Grrrls, did eventually hit
the media through artists
such as The Spice Girls
becoming popularised.
Looking back, the Riot
Grrrl movement is now
attributed to the beginning
of third wave feminism,
where feminists sought
to change the systems
that the first two waves
of feminism gained rights
from, and break down
the ideologies that gave
men permission to decide
on women’s issues and
that trained women to be
subservient to them. It
also built on the idea of
promoting individuality
and opening up feminism
to women of colour and
transgender women.
While Riot Grrrl may be
long gone, many of its
principles live on in mod-
ern-day feminism – surely
social media is just an
updated zine?
