Twilight of the Old Order in China’s Most

A
s the
Coronavirus
epidemic takes
lead in the
news, everything else
seems to have diminished
importance. This is par-
ticularly true for a city that
has endured a troublesome
period in the last year.
Hong Kong, a city unique
for its history and identity,
marked by cultural ex-
changes between East and
West, whose streets have
witnessed overcrowding
and tear gas and unreal
emptiness in the span of
less than 12 months.
While this unreal
quietness has blanketed
the city in the midst of
the epidemic, what was
known as the Fragrant
Harbour will certainly
not succumb to the crisis
it faces. Fights and polit-
ical bipolarism have only
been set aside, awaiting
the right moment for a
rampant comeback.
In order to better under-
stand the peculiar situation
of Britain’s last colony,
I analysed an instructive
lecture that was recently
delivered by Lord Patten,
HK’s last Governor. Then
I also had an illuminating
talk with Professor John
Carroll, who currently
teaches History at Hong
Kong University. Below
are the principal points we

The Handover
One thing I was particu-
larly eager to consider was
the issue of Hong Kong’s
handover to China.
China and the United
Kingdom agreed to an
orderly restitution of the
territory from British to
Chinese sovereignty in
1984. The document con-
cretising this decision was
signed in that year by UK
PM Margaret Thatcher
and her Chinese coun-
terpart Zhao Ziyang. The
reason behind this agree-
ment was the approaching
expiry, in 1997, of the 99
years lease of the New
Territories, a signiﬁcant
part of what by that time
Hong Kong had become.
The land was originally
ceded by Imperial China
as a consequence of its
defeat in the Third Opium
War. The negotiations
concerning the terms of
the restitution did not
involve any participation
from the people of Hong
Kong, who had to accept
passively the decisions
others were making for
them.
The question of why
Hong Kong was not
offered any referendum,
as for other countries in
the British Empire, is
therefore noteworthy.
Professor Carroll under-
lined that in Hong Kong
although such a scenario
may have been prospected
by some activists in the
1950s, there was actually
China or was holding
Hong Kong better for the
interests of the UK?
The answer appeared
clear to Margaret Thatcher
who “was not committed
to democracy” and rather
“hated Communism”, and
so, ironically, I would
add, ended up giving one
of the greatest gifts a
Communist country has
ever received.
Prof. Carroll was
however keen to under-
line that nonetheless, the
handover also marked
the end of British colo-
nialism, a reality that for
most of history meant suf-
ferance and oppression.
Only its last exponent,
namely Lord Patten, tried
to implement some sort
of democratic reform,
while until that point the
UK had basically never
granted any form of public
participation for Hong
Kong citizens in decision
making. For this approach,
Lord Pattern became a
controversial ﬁgure in
particular coldly received
by China, which main-
tained that after the Joint
Declaration, no further
change in the govern-
ment structure of the
colony should have been
made. The last Governor
claimed instead that no
political establishment
no mass movement
towards this goal. He
noted, however, that secret
plans about a referendum
may be elucidated by the
British Government, but
the only way we can ﬁnd
out is through declassiﬁed
ﬁles that are periodically
released by the govern-
ments.
The other side of the
coin is that China would
never have allowed such
an act of self-determi-
nation and China’s rise
was indeed a fact that
could not be underesti-
mated. This was already
common knowledge in
1967, a violent year for
Hong Kong marked with
frenzied clashes, when the
UK instructed its ofﬁcials
in the Colony not to ex-
cessively repress dissent-
ing Communists, fearing
to anger China. By 1984,
Prof. Carroll says, “China
was the bigger picture”
economically speaking; in
other words, was having
a better relationship with
Hong Kong politics: he
has been praised by some,
demonised by others. As
Prof. Carroll recalled,
he was even given some
derogatory nicknames,
e.g. “the Prostitute of the
Millennium”.

cratic reforms were in
