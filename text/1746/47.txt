CRYPTOGRAM
The letters of the alphabet have been scrambled and numbered
0 to 25. A quote has been hidden for you to decode, and a grid
has been provided to help you out.

MASTERMIND
Special thanks goes to DoCâ€™s Duncan White, who has very kindly developed the code to gener-
ate Mastermind puzzles like these, along with their relevant graphics for us to use!
Try to guess a secret code of colours in a specific order.
A black peg indicates a correct colour in the correct position. Of course, you are not told with
position(s) contain the correct colour, simply how many positions contain the correct colour.
A white peg indicates a misplaced colour - the correct colour but in a different position! A few
guesses have already been given, leadinng to a unique solution!
There are easier variations with more examples at:
https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dcw/Mastermind.pdf
Here are the colours available:
Last weekâ€™s solutions
SHIKAKU
Divide the square into rectangles, such that each
rectangle contains exactly one number. The num-
bers given represent the area of the containing rec-
tangle.
MINESWEEPER
The number in a cell represents the number of mines adjacent to
that square (up/down, left/right, diagonal). Find and mark all of the
mines to clear the board.
It would be very helpful if you could also tell us how long it took for you to complete this puzzle!
