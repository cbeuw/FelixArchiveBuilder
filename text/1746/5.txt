A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
This week, Felix spoke with the Deputy President (Finance & Services), Fifi Henry, to ask about updates on hbar,
568, the Services & Sustainability Board, and the Summer Ball
Fifi Henry, the DPFS // ICU
Felix: What is the sit-
uation with hbar?
FH: I was invited along-
side Abhijay (President),
Mohit (GSU President),
Head of Student Expe-
rience and Operations
Manager to a meeting
mid-Feb with Campus
Services and College
staff about the future of
h-bar. There were many
very valid points raised
about how the space and
atmosphere are not quite
ﬁt for purpose, what
postgrads and staff would
like from the space (both
in terms of food, furniture
and events) and where we
go moving forward. Part
of this conversation did
focus on the food offering,
and how we can work
together to provide the
best service. As there are
now conversations about
the bigger picture and long
term future of h-bar, the
equipment that needed to
be purchased was put on
hold indeﬁnitely, awaiting
progress updates.
Felix: How is the 568
reopening going, and
do we have financial
data on the effect of
the closure?
FH: It’s going well! After
a few blips at the start
(mostly running-out-of-
cheese related), we are
back in full swing, and
always looking for poten-
tial to improve. Of course,
the kitchens being closed
for 2.5 months has had a
signiﬁcant impact on our
ﬁnances, in the region of
£40k loss on dry alone,
but we know this also had
an impact on the wet sales
and student experience
too, which affects the
ﬁnances on the day and
loss of regular custom
respectively.
Felix: What has been
happening with the
block grant negotia-
tions?
FH: The senior managers
at the Union are working
through Department
Operating plans to ensure
that all teams work as
effectively and efﬁciently
as possible. This not only
helps us deﬁne what is
corefortheUnion,butalso
shows that we have a plan
for a successful year, and
the Block Grant should
support x,y,z activities to
achieve this. These plans
are being pulled together
in order for the Finance
& Risk committee and
Board of Trustees to have
oversight before ﬁnalising
the proposal for College.
Felix: Could you
speak a bit about the
Services & Sustain-
ability Board and
Greening Imperial?
FH: The Services &
Sustainability Board are
currently going through
a review for how the
committee should be run,
and have already had a
meeting around what cur-
rently doesn’t quite work
and what may work better.
We had a plan to run a
sustainability campaign
throughout February, but
the demands on an already
highly-engaged group of
students was evidently too
much, and it was deemed
reasonable to reassess
how we move forward.
It is the ﬁrst year this
committee has existed,
and so I am not surprised
that it is not ﬂawless ﬁrst
time around. I am excited
about the amount of po-
tential it holds, and know
it can do a lot of good
for students, the Union
and Imperial overall, and
I hope that I can reform
the foundations to solidly
support this growth.
Felix: Have you fig-
ured out a better way
to deal with contracts
yet as spoken about
previously?
FH: The eActivities route
(to have an un-editable
format with pre-written
clauses from me that a
CSP can pick and choose
from) is a working
progress. I am looking
to do a bigger role of the
DPFS role to remove
admin, as this is a massive
time drain that doesn’t
allow whomever is in post
to work on larger projects
and achieve more on their
manifesto, and contracts
may fall under that, but
it is very much a “watch
this space!” project at the
moment!
Felix: Do you have
any other general
comments, such
as on other things
you’ve been working
on, or just anything
you want to talk
about?
FH: The Summer Ball
Committee selected the
Hoosiers in the later half
of ﬁrst term 2019. We had
already agreed to move
from a DJ (as we have
always had in the past) to
a live performance from a
well known and popular
artist. We felt that the
Hoosiers were an amazing
ﬁt, with songs that lots
of students will instantly
recognise, and could put
on an excellent show!
We want you – yes, you! We’re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, reporters, computer ex-
perts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed – we’ll teach you everything you need to know.
