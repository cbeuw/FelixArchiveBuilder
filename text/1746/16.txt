Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2020)
An 18th Century lesbian romance everyone must see
B
efore I get into
this review,
I’d like to first
say I can do
nothing but respect Céline
Sciamma’s feminism that
she so unmistakeably
displays in both her film-
making and life. Here I
am of course referencing
her, along with the rest of
the crew’s, walkout of the
César Awards ceremony
after (convicted paedo-
phile) Roman Polanski’s
win. It is refreshing to
see people within the film
industry refuse to be com-
plicit as they so often are.
I know this had nothing to
do with the film, but for
me it added some more
authenticity to the story
and characters and was
an important moment for
film.
Portrait of a Lady on
Fire is an 18th century
period piece telling the
story of Marianne, a
young artist hired to
paint a wedding portrait
of Héloïse, an aristocrat
set to be married off to a
man in Milan against her
will. The film begins with
a student asking Marianne
about a painting of hers;
this invokes a clear
emotional response in
Marianne and she tells her
student the painting, titled
‘Portrait de la jeune fille
en feu’, was made many
years ago. We then take
a dive into Marianne’s
memories and flashback
to her sailing to an isolated
island in Brittany. Once
there, she is informed
that Héloïse is defiant;
she does not want to be
married and hence refuses
to sit for her portrait.
Instead, Marianne must
pretend she has been hired
as a walking companion
for her. She spends her
days stealing glances at
her subject’s features and
her nights painting them
from memory.
Having only just
returned from the
convent, we see Héloïse
enjoy her first spell of
freedom in her lifetime.
These happy scenes of
her swimming for the first
time and enjoying music
that Marianne plays for
her, amongst many others,
are accompanied with a
feeling of melancholy,
as it will also be her last
before her wedding. She
knows this, too. This is
particularly thought-pro-
“The film is
quite slow and
isn’t very thick
with plot, yet
manages to
pack a punch”
“Despite being
set over only
two weeks,
the once in a
lifetime love
between the
characters
was totally
believable”
voking when in response
to Marianne suggesting
there will be good times in
Milan, Héloïse essentially
says that it doesn’t matter
when she does not have the
freedom of choice – these
things will just be there to
‘console’ her. There are
various moments like this
scattered throughout the
film that more explicitly
display director and writer
Sciamma’s point, but
overall, there are overar-
ching themes of women
in love, friendships in art,
as well as women’s liber-
ation, that are quietly dis-
played in each and every
scene. Even though these
themes are in the context
of the 18th century, they
are still resonant in society
today. It is noteworthy
that there was not a single
male character in this
entire film and hence we
were all spared of having
a male view imposed on
any of these characters.
Spending each day with
one another, an inevitable
bond is formed. There
is a pivotal moment in
the film in which Mar-
ianne’s true purpose on
the island is revealed and
rather than being angry,
Héloïse agrees to pose for
her. From this moment
forward, their intimacy
and attraction towards
each other blossom and
a romance between the
two women begins. One
of the things I loved most
about this romance was
the balance between the
couple. Neither had more
power over the other,
which is what you may
expect between artist
and model. This theme
was touched upon in
one scene where Héloïse
tells Marianne she does
not hate being watched
by the painter, as this
entire time she has been
observing Marianne too.
The portrait becomes a
collaborative piece of
work, however, being the
1700’s, we (audience and
characters alike) were all
aware that the faster it ap-
proaches completion, the
sooner this relationship
between the two women
must end. Watching this,
you are devastated for
them. Because of this, I
was completely expecting
the ending to be sad, but
personally I found it sur-
prisingly happy; though
the final scene is certainly
poignant enough to be
moved to tears.
The film is quite slow
and isn’t very thick with
plot, yet manages to pack
a punch. This is heavily
due to the cinematogra-
phy employed through-
out. We don’t explicitly
need dialogue or scenes
of intimacy between the
characters to realise that
they have fallen in love,
instead we have clever
camerawork that depicts
the way they gaze at one
another - full of love
and desire. The use of
lighting and framing is
perfect throughout. And
if you’re someone like
me who has an eye for all
things pretty, you can do
nothing but appreciate the
videography and visuals
of cinematographer Claire
Mathon. The colour
palette and landscapes
used in Portrait of a Lady
on Fire were gorgeous.
The two actresses
leading this film, Noémie
Merlant (Marianne) and
Adèle Haenel (Héloïse)
played their parts ex-
ceptionally. I realised
walking out of the cinema
that the film was only set
over a couple of weeks
and yet the perhaps once
in a lifetime love between
these two characters
was totally believable.
I believe this is mostly
due to the two actresses,
who both melted into
their roles and each other.
Also, whilst there were no
explicit sex scenes in the
film, it was still sensual
and there was enough on-
screen chemistry between
the pair that you felt the
passion just from their
looks and body language.
From writing to acting,
direction to costume
design, cinematography to
editing, I would describe
this film as perfect. I
cannot believe it wasn’t
nominated for an Oscar. It
is a beautiful and genuine
romance expressed in the
most picturesque way, and
I was truly moved whilst
watching it. As a testa-
ment to how good the film
is, upon watching Portrait
of a Lady on Fire, I have
decided I must go back
and watch everything
Céline Sciamma has
worked on and everything
she will work on in the
future.
