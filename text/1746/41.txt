aving read the
title, I have
no doubt that
readers will
have already made up
their minds. Whether
you’re already involved in
your DepSoc, enjoy going
to the smaller events and
find the careers support
invaluable, or you don’t
really have an active
DepSoc, and you prefer
the bar nights, club nights
and other niche events
your CU organises.
As someone who is
highly involved in both
my DepSoc, MathSoc,
and the RCSU, if you
asked me which is better
or has a greater impact, I
wouldn’t be able to give
you a straight answer.
Therefore I’m not even
going to to try to convince
you that one’s better than
the other, because that’s
not the case. Instead I’m
going to try to show you
how both need to work
together harmoniously in
order to maximise their
potential and serve their
using DepSocs.
However, CUs can
manage a couple of things
DepSocs would struggle
to achieve:
a) Larger events like
Revel and Autumn Ball,
that small DepSocs would
not be able to drum up a
large attendance for.
b) Niche events like
yoga and gardening as
seen in our Welfare Week,
RCSYou, which only
attract 5-10 people from
each department of FoNS.
However if the RCSU
runs them, then collec-
tively there is a sufficient
interest in these events
c) Engage multiple so-
cieties in events, encour-
aging interdisciplinary
engagement
The role of a CU is to
support its societies, rather
than compete with them. It
should not run events that
could otherwise be easily
organised by the DepSocs
or compete with existing
DepSoc events, such as
Christmas Dinners or
movie/games nights.
Applying this philoso-
phy in practice, we have
seen an increase in the
amount of interaction
between the RCSU and
its 5 consituent DepSocs
this year. The DepSocs
have actively publicised
RCSU events while
the RCSU has stuck to
not competing with its
DepSocs. However, when
the RCSU has run an
event that should have
been run by a DepSoc, we
have seen the error of our
ways and learnt from our
mistakes going forward.
With what can only be
described as one of the
most successful Revels
in recent years we were
pleased to have engaged
many members from

student members.
If you’re reading this
now then you’re one of the
CU section’s most com-
mitted readers. Despite
the comments about how
we’re not engaging our
DepSocs enough from
last week’s issue, the
RCSU has come a long
way in making sure that it
is not competing with its
DepSocs this year.
For example, whenever
the RCSU hosts an event,
such as Roaring Revel, the
RCSU makes sure that all
of the DepSocs are firstly
aware of the event, so they
don’t schedule their own
events at the same time,
and secondly engaging
DepSoc members by
encouraging DepSocs to
publicise RCSU events.
This has been particularly
successful with events
such as the Mums and
Dads Pub Crawl, Autumn
Ball, Revel and using
the DepReps to publicise
RCSYou.
The advantage that
DepSocs have is that
they are able to engage
their freshers easily
through welcome events
such as Mums and Dads,
leading students to im-
mediately identify with
their DepSoc. CUs find it
harder to engage students
in Freshers week without
33
across all 4 departments.
This wouldn’t have been
possible without DepSocs’
support in publicising and
making people aware of
the event.
Going forward I believe
that the relationship
between the RCSU and
its component DepSocs
will only get stronger.
By talking more and sup-
porting each other, things
can only get better and
after the positive changes
We want you – yes, you! We’re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, reporters, computer ex-
perts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed – we’ll teach you everything you need to know.

Felix is recruiting!
we’ve seen this year I
suspect this won’t be too
hard to implement in the
coming years.
So, don’t choose a
side. Be both. Cherish
your DepSoc of course,
but also remember what
CU you’re a part of. The
Constituent Unions are
steeped in a century of
history and form a valuble
community that we are
lucky to be a part of. Lets
all take advantage of that!
