College Reveals Socially Responsible Investment
Policy
O
n Monday
2nd March,
the College
revealed their
Socially Responsible
Investment Policy,
which directs what areas
their Endowment Board
– which controls the
investment portfolio –
can directly or indirectly
invest into.
The new policy ensures
that “any investment de-
cisions take into account
the same social, environ-
mental and governance
concerns as the College”,
according to the College
website. Specifically, it
mandates the College
and their fund managers
to sign the UN Principles
of Responsible Invest-
ment, and then for the
Endowment Board to use
“engagement”, or in other
words to utilise the Col-
lege’s financial inﬂuence,
to encourage changes in
their investment partners.
Should these partners not
demonstrate change, the
College has promised to
also use other areas of in-
ﬂuence – such as research
– to further encourage
positive development.
Divestment will
follow only if the cause
is deemed hopeless – if
the company in question
refuses to change after
every avenue of inﬂuence
has been exhausted. The
metric by which a will-
ingness to change is to be
measured is not specified,

ment said that as a result,
the policy is “effectively
useless and nothing more
than greenwashing.”
other than reference to the
Paris Agreement targets
as an end-goal.
Specific restrictions
also exist atop the above
general policy: the
College has promised not
to invest in tobacco, illegal
munitions manufacture,
or, regarding fossil fuels,
to “divest from direct
and indirect investments
in companies engaged in
[thermal coal and tar sand
extraction].”
Despite this last restric-
tion, however, an email
sent from the Provost
to Divest Imperial – a
student campaign that
has been pushing for full
divestment from fossil
fuels for several years –
said that this would not
include larger fossil fuel
corporations such as BP
or Chevron, despite these
companies directly engag-
ing in those activities.
Specifically, it said:
“companies whose sole
business is coal or tar
sands would not meet
[Paris agreement targets].
Companies including
some of those [Divest]
note have both larger port-
folios and intention (with
action) to move towards
the Paris targets and thus
we would not rule those
out for our engagement.”
In a response, Divest
noted that the wording of
the other restrictions is
similar, and thus that if
this is the interpretation
then the College can
presumably continue to
invest in any tobacco- or
illegal munitions-produc-
ing companies so long
as those companies also

The College has agreed to place limits on the investments of their Endowment Board, but with caveats that have
left some students feeling the promises are hollow

Summer Ball Headliner
Revealed: The Hoosiers
T
he Summer
Ball’s headline
act was revealed
on Monday
2nd March to be The
Hoosiers. This represents
a departure from DJs of
previous years by return-
ing to a live act.
The Hoosiers are a
well-known pop-rock
band whose debut album,
The Trick to Life, hit
number one on the UK
album charts on release
in October 2007, and are
likely most famous for the
songs ‘Goodbye Mr. A’
and ‘Worried About Rey’
from that same album.
Student reactions have
broadly been positive,
with those canvassed by
Felix glad of the return
of a live act with a high
profile.
The decision to bring
back a live act was made
by the Summer Ball com-
mittee, a group of students
who – for the first time –
are running the Summer
Ball as a student-led
event.
Fifi Henry, the Union’s
Deputy President of
Finance and Services, and
Chair of the committee,
said:
“The Summer Ball
Committee selected the
Hoosiers in the later half
of first term 2019. We had
already agreed to move
from a DJ (as we have
always had in the past) to
a live performance from a
well known and popular
artist. We felt that the
Hoosiers were an amazing
fit, with songs that lots
of students will instantly
recognise, and could put
on an excellent show!”
