(selfie stick, iPhone 10,
iPhone 10 S, iPhone 10
SS, iPhone 10 SSHH…)
and elitism that only a few
can afford but directed
towards the real necessi-
ties of the people. What
growth really refers to is
growth of contamination
rates, growth of inequal-
ity, growth of precarious
jobs, growth of the market
against the environment
and against the people.
This is the point where
Alberto and I differ, he
believes growth and
ecologism are compatible,
what is more, he seems to
declare them best friends,
so he would probably not
agree with my previous
rant about “growth”. But
let us talk about degrowth.
Degrowth does not
mean a decrease in the
quality of life or that
you will have to live
in dark green forests;
that is just the picture
painted by, again, the
usual suspects. Degrowth
is a set of policies and
measures directed
towards the achieve-
ment of a society where
contamination degrows,
inequality degrows and
the importance of the
omnipresent market
degrows. Degrowth is
(not paradoxically) also
about growth: growth
of green jobs, growth
of public services and
property, growth of civil
participation and decision
making, growth of small
business, growth of biodi-
versity… This is precisely
the system change I was
talking about, one that
puts people first and, like
parents with their kids,
tells big business when
they are crossing the line.
So, I think Alberto should
have at least mentioned
how degrowth “takes
away: teachers, hospi-
tals, doctors and even
freedom”, as it seems to
me to be quite the opposite
case. I recommend Naomi
Klein’s “This Changes
Everything” for a well-re-
searched (better written)
introduction to many
topics regarding capital-
ism, ecologism and green
After telling us about
his affinity for rats, misi-
dentifying the arguments
of the “Greta cult” and
stating that degrowth is the
devil in disguise , Alberto
claims that the only
alternative to ecologists’
miserable and apocalyptic
solution to our miserable
and apocalyptic future
is the same capitalism
(i.e. our miserable and
soon to be apocalyptic
present) that precisely
led us to this situation. To
back this bold claim, he
presents the example of
the river Thames, which
he argues is at its most
biodiverse for centuries!
This is true, it was even
declared biologically dead
in 1957 and biodiversity
has improved since the
industrial revolution, but
saying that it is thanks to
our friend capitalism is a
bit of a stretch. The end
on the British Empire
meant a huge decrease
of usage of the river and
the displacement of heavy
industry from London
to the periphery helped
a lot. About companies
cleaning the river because
it is in their interest, as
far as research has led
me this was because
of stricter changes in
the legislation, not the
company’s “generous”
nature. Regardless, we
should not be thanking
a company for cleaning,
even voluntarily, what
they dirty (at least I do not
thank my dirty flatmate
for cleaning his shit). He
also mentions how this is
a solution found within
the capitalist framework,
it is true as well, and it
matches very well with
degrowth’s legislation
over companies. Maybe,
Alberto, you agree with
the “Greta cult” more than
you think! Being more
rigorous now, one cannot
present a Thames example
as a “proof” that capi-
talism eco-rocks, when
capitalism is, as I have
already said, the cause of
the climate crisis (maybe
you would like to argue
against that too). Regard-
ing democracy, I believe
no Greta is threatening
democracy, but rather
trying to make our current
liberal democracies more
participative and closer to
the people, so I cannot see
how democracy is antag-
onistic to ecologism and
degrowth. What I can see
is how ecologism chal-
lenges political systems
that do not represent their
people, in who sovereign-
ty lies, and how that can
be an issue for the usual
suspects; but that is not
surprising.
Lastly, I wanted to
talk about a figure that I
have noticed has emerged
parallel to the far right
globally, that of the “po-
litically incorrect knight”.
Reading Alberto’s article
made me think more
about this idea, so I will
use it to exemplify the
concept. Opposite to the
well-known online “white
knight” who fights for
progressive causes such
as (especially) feminism,
LGTB+ movement, ecol-
ogism… in a saviour-like
manner, the “politically
incorrect knights” are
those individuals who
fight against these
progressive ideas in a
rather insulting, direct
or merciless way, hence
the politically incorrect.
This role comes from the
threat perceived by some
sectors of society in pro-
gressive ideas becoming
hegemonic in our culture.
In order to attack them
without looking reac-
tionary or archaic, they
raise in their discourse
these progressive ideas
to hegemonic (when they
are far from it), widely
accepted or politically
correct so that they can
then charge against them
as a revolutionary act
against the establishment.
In the case of this article,
Alberto identified ecolo-
gism as hegemonic, even
saying that most parties
have made it its number
one priority. This is far
from true and not even
left parties pay nearly
enough importance to
ecologism, the priority for
parties remains numbers
that say something about
the sacred economy (or
Brexit in the case of the
UK). The title of his
article also illuminates
the revolutionary aspect
of the act (yes I know it is
also a pun), as he presents
his text as one daring to
stand up against Greta
the eco-dictator, stealing
the girl her dreams in
his last paragraph. Well,
Alberto, I will not be the
one to steal your dreams,
but I can assure you that
not even you, or a few fat
companies will be able
to steal our dream for a
better society.
