T
he ‘Meet the
Candidates’ de-
bate was hosted
live in Metric
on Wednesday 4th
March and livestreamed
on the Union Facebook
page. The purpose was
to give students a great-
er insight into the man-
ifesto promises of those
who have nominated
themselves for major
Union positions.
The positions included
were the Felix Editor,
the Union President, and
the Deputy Presidents of
Welfare (DPW), Clubs
and Societies (DPCS),
Finance and Services
(DPFS), and Education
(DPE).
The debate took place
shortly after the opening
of campaigning, fol-
lowing a briefing from
the Union on campaign
guidelines to each candi-
date, meaning that it was
the first opportunity for an
in-depth look at future po-
tential sabbatical officers’
views and perspectives.
Campaigning will run
from now, through the
opening of voting on the
9th of March, and until
voting closes on Thursday
the 12th. Results will be
announced on the 13th at
a Results Party in Metric.
The event, hosted by
the Felix Deputy Editor
Charlie Titmuss and
co-hosted by the Arts
and Entertainment Man-
agement Chair Joseph
O’Connell-Danes, had
heavy technical support
from Imperial College
Television, as well as
publicity support from the
Union’s communications
team.
For several roles –
namely the DPFS, Felix
Editor, DPCS, and DPE
– only one candidate is
either running or was
able to attend the debate,
leaving individual candi-
dates to be grilled by the
host on their manifestos
and broader queries re-
garding their plans for the
role. For the other roles,
there was strong debate
between each candidate.
Additionally, questions
were posed by the audi-
ence via the livestream
comment section, further
pushing candidates on the
issues that mattered most
to the students watching.
Between debates, the
co-host along with a panel
of guest pundits offered
student perspective and
commentary on the re-
sponses of each candidate.
The election results
will be revealed on Friday
the 13th, after voting
closes, at a Results Party
in Metric.
Editor’s note: manifes-
tos for major Union roles
have been reproduced in
the Manifesto Pullout in
this issue of Felix.
I have chosen not to
offer commentary or
analysis on the content
of the debates in an
effort to remain impartial
and not influence the
election before voting
closes. I highly suggest
every student watches the
debate prior to voting on
the included roles; can-
didates gave thoughtful
and insightful answers,
and each answer shows
directly how your student
experience will be shaped.

perspectives”

Imperial
'Cut the
Rent'
Launch
T
he ‘Imperial
Cut the Rent’
campaign has of-
ficially launched
as of Monday 2nd March.
The campaign takes its
name from the UCL
campaign, which peaked
in 2016/2017 with rent
strikes after two years of
other campaign strategies.
The launch comes
following the College’s
decision to move ahead
with steep rent increases
over the next five years,
which will result in a
room in South Kensington
costing approximately
£300 per week by
2024/25.
This figure is in spite
of a £3 million reduction
in the total revenue
expected across the five-
year period, as a result of
Union negotiations.
The campaign will seek
to elect a committee of in-
terested students to lead in
the coming months before
the end of term. The Union
President and Deputy
President (Welfare) will
not be directly leading the
campaign, instead liaising
with the student leaders.
The UCL campaign
eventually resulted in a
sizable bursary for less
well-off students, as well
as a freeze on prices for
the subsequent academic
year. It was followed
by a wave of ‘Cut the
Rent’ campaigns across
the country, resulting in
successful slashes to rent
prices at Goldsmiths,
Liverpool, and other uni-
versities.
