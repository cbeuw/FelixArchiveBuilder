After HalfADecade Caribou Suddenly Returns
F
ive long years
have passed
and finally Dan
Snaith has made
a return under his moniker
Caribou. Suddenly is the
fifth release from the
Canadian musician and
this most recent project is
distinctly more personal
than Snaith’s previous
releases.
Change is the central
theme of the album,
as Snaith has decided
to tell stories from
personal relationships.
For example, the opener
“Sister” explores diffi-
culties Snaith has with
his siblings and “Home”
about a friend of his who
ended a toxic relationship.
In Suddenly Snaith
demonstrates the mastery
he has achieved over his
distinct contemporary
style, combining synthetic
and acoustic elements
resulting an exceptionally
soulful electronica sound.
As he’s been known to do,
Snaith avoids quantising
his music too much,
allowing irregularities
that in most electronic
music would be consid-
ered “errors”. The slight
lack of rigidity only adds
to the albums character.
The intimacy of topics
is the album is amplified
by the way in which Snaith
uses his voice throughout.
Ever so softly, slightly
held back, like being at
a private show just for
you. However, Snaith’s
vocals are never too timid
to be pushed down by the
instrumental. Even on the
track“YouandI”,amongst
jarring beat switches and
a beautifully crisp wailing
guitar, Snaith’s tempered
voice still holds its place.
While a more personal
touch has been taken,
the album is not lacking
in infectiously energetic
moments. “New Jade”
packs a tidy punch with
busy percussion and
glitchy vocals. The track
“Never Come Back”
feels like a contemporary
take on the house style of
808’s, catchy piano riffs
and soulful vocals.
Tracks-by-track there is
a lack of flow. The album
has been constructed in
a patchwork style where
there is a distinct sonic
shade being presented
(much like the block
colour artwork of the
single releases). One of the
clearest shades painted is
in the lead single “Home”.
The style is a take on old
school hip-hop sample
centred beats. Snaith has
commented on how he
arranged the sampled
vocals to act as a sort of
duo/call-and-response,
two people returning
home to their loved ones.
It’s wonderfully melan-
cholic, the kind of song
you imagine reconnecting
with an old friend over.
The patchwork
assembly of the album
can do it a bit of a disser-
vice at times. Listening
through the whole album,
transitions from one song
can leave an aftertaste that
spoils the next. However,
this is a relatively minor
disruption as the character
of each track is so distinct
it’s hard not to get lost
back into the music.
Suddenly is an excep-
tion return for Snaith and
well worth the wait. We
can only hope that the
next release is a bit more
sudden than this one.
