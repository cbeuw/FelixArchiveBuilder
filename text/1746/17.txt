Uncut Gems (2020)
I
f you haven’t seen it
advertised by Netflix
already, Uncut Gems
stars Adam Sandler
as New York jewelry
dealer, Howard Ratner,
in-debt to just about every
man in the Manhattan
diamond district. It’s the
fifth feature film of the
quickly rising Safdie
brothers, compromised of
Josh and Benny, with their
most recent work gaining
praise from critics and
audiences alike; Uncut
Gems no exception to the
rule.
Having only seen their
prior film, Good Time
(2017), I had some idea
what I was getting myself
in for with this; a fast-
paced, tense and gritty
drama centered around
one character. Although
this was true, I was still
not prepared for the sheer
relentless pace and tension
this film created.
It is by no means
exaggeration when I say
that this film gave me
near heart palpitations.
The way the film follows
Sandler through every
decision he makes shows
us the full extent to how
downward his life is
spiraling. He gets by from
encounter to encounter,
just about keeping afloat,
and his sheer character
alone is what keeps him
from self-combusting
at any moment. This
expertly crafted script
from the duo was at the
very forefront of this film,
with Sandler’s perfor-
mance only elevating the
words on the paper to the
screen.
The way that the Safdie
brothers put you right in
the middle of the con-
frontations, the clubs, the
shouting, the arguments;
it comes as such a release
when we’re treated to
anything other than pure
restlessness, and you
forget what it is to live
normally. The constant
high octane, uncom-
promising show simply
is Howard’s life, and
nothing seems to go right
for him. But then it does.
And now he throws it
away. This is the constant
cycle that Howard creates,
and it is just bonkers to
watch. Never before have
I rooted for a character
so much, yet completely
questioned every decision
he made.
The continually
mounting tension left
me wanting Howard to
just get a break more
than anything, and the
end of the film provided
this for me. Something
finally goes right for
him. The boot that the
Safdie brothers have been
pressing into my temple
is finally lifted, and as
the film ends, you’re
left wondering how 160
minutes have just passed.
If you’re complaining
that there are no good
films on Netflix, and
you’re yet to watch Uncut
Gems, look no further
for a way to spend your
evening.
Would You Rather There Was An Advert Here?
T
here probably
would have been
an advert here.
We don’t have
another article this week,
and we’d normally just
put ‘Felix is recruiting!’ at
the bottom.
It would look really
strange if it was just
blank. It could have been
blank, or if I change a
letter, black. Like a cut
to black. Like a cut to
black by Bergman. I’m
writing in 11pt Times
New Roman, he wrote in
104pt Florida. Sometimes
he wrote in EF Windsor.
But Windsor was wist-
fully whisked away by
Woody. (Allen of course).
It’s very recognisable.
You’d definitely know it
if you saw it; it’s that sort
of flowery posh font that’s
in all his films. I quite like
it. I would show you what
it looked like here, but I
don’t know if I’m allowed
to change the font. That’s
Felix’s fastidious font fiat.
Is the font consistency
through films a require-
ment to be an auteur?
Wes and his Futura that he
borrowed from Kubrick.
Very recognisable. It looks
nice but who really cares
if it’s the same. Godard
danced about in Helvetica
and Univers, Tarkovsky in
Pump. They’re just f**ing
fonts.
Bong Joon-ho’s got
everyone talking; he’s
very deserving of the
praise really. Parasite was
a great film. It didn’t grate
on me at all. I can’t lie and
say I’ve been a fan of his
for years, I mean I’d only
seen Okja, but I’ve heard
he’s very good. I’ve even
read it.
He met Oscar a few
weeks ago and everyone
was surprised. Everyone
loved that their meet-
ingwas unexpected, and
everyone was so quick
to congratulate him. ‘A
landmark in cinema’, the
first foreign film to win
the Best Picture Oscar.
What mark has it left? Are
we going to have more
andn more foreign films
streaming through the
main media. It would be
nice if that were the case.
People like good films.
People like films that
other people say are good.
Reviews mean a lot more
now than they did a few
years ago. Their score on
Rotten Tomatoes, their
rating on Metacritic. This
film is 100% rotten. That
sounds like an excellent
film. I’ll write to Fellini
telling him that 8½ was
98% rotten. I’m sure he’d
like that, to know just how
rotten his film was.
If a film is 20% rotten
it’s a bad film. I know
because other people have
told me. I don’t need to
watch this film because
I know that it is only
20% rotten, it’s only 44
on Metacritic. We’re all
guilty of it, looking at the
reviews and making up
our minds already.
Maybe we should make
a secret pact to all go see
a film and give it terrible
reviews. We’ll say it’s 0%
rotten and 22 on Metacrit-
ic. Then no one else will
go and see it. We’ll have
our own little film that
we all know is amazing,
but people say oh that’s
a terrible film, and we’ll
agree.
I wonder if reviews
have that cascade effect.
If people start saying that
something’s really good
and everybody agrees.
They give it good reviews
and it amplifies and
grows. Now everyone is
saying it’s a great film, but
really it was just a good
film. Those fools. They
can’t tell the difference
between a good film and a
great film. I can’t tell the
difference either.
Have you read the
book? No, but I’ve
watched the film. That’s
not the same. Why’s it
not? The book has more
detail and it’s more enjoy-
able. That’s a good point.
Which of the two took
more time though. Did
it take longer to write
the book or make the
film. I mean all of it. The
script, the production,
the editing. If you added
up all the hours of all the
people involved with the
film would it be longer
than the book? So which
is more impressive, the
book or the film. Depends
on the book, I guess.
Someone told me
naming directors makes
me more qualified to
write for the film section.
From Bertolucci to Bong
Joon-ho, now to Fellini
and Tarantino, Terrence
Mallick work your
magic, here’s Jacques
Demy and Tarkovsky,
there goes Varda working
harder, than Godard the
avant-garde, Kurosawa
had great power, while
Buster Keaton never
beaten, I could list
another name but in the
end they’re all the f**ing
same.
Or would you rather
there was an advert here?
