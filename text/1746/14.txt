Madam Butterfly – Gorgeous yet Problematic
I
n a world where
cultural appropri-
ation is not only
frowned upon, but
actively fought against,
it is beyond me that op-
era critics and viewers
alike have seemingly
given Madam Butterfly
a pass for their portrayal
of Japanese characters
by non-Asian actors.
But I’m getting ahead
of myself.
Madam Butterfly is one
of Puccini’s most famous
works next to La Bohème,
and probably rightfully
so. It follows the fifteen-
year-old Cio-Cio San
(Natalya Romaniw) who
gets leased to marry the
American naval officer
Pinkerton (Dimitri Pittas).
The first of the three
acts is by far the weakest,
as the plot is cluttered
with explanations and
set-ups, only to mildly pay
off with a romantic scene
near the end of the act.
The sentiment is there,
but its heart gets lost in
the translation, making it
drag. The remaining two
acts, thanks to a major rev-
elation and a flash forward
in time, are superb. They
are as beautiful as they
are gut-wrenching, in
no small part thanks to
Romaniw, who soars as
Cio-Cio San, demon-
strating a masterclass in
singing and emoting.
Apart from Romaniw’s
performance, it is the
lighting that elevates
Madam Butterfly. The
bright pastel colour
scheme is absolutely
perfect. The lighting
colour scheme evolves
with the changing mood
of the play, adding yet
another layer of depth
to the production. There
is also some puppetry
throughout the show,
which is definitely
adorable, but in no way
innovative or irreplacea-
ble.
Madam Butterfly
is a show about love,
devotion, betrayal and
desperation. But make no
mistake, it is also deeply
political, touching on
topics such as East versus
West and the American
Dream. At times this is
done through words, but
at other times, it is simply
through the integration of
pan-Asian motifs as well
as direct references to the
Star-Spangled Banner,
while firmly staying
rooted in its classical
style.
Overall, although clut-
tered with exposition at
first, Madam Butterfly is
deeply engaging, lending
itself to a rich and satis-
fying climax and conclu-
sion, both musically and
story-wise. It is a timeless
piece with universal
themes, and it is clear how
it has had a direct influ-
ence on the 20th century
musicals. In fact, various
musical motifs used are
reminiscent of some of
the more tender moments
in Les Miserables, which
came around 81 years
after Madam Butterfly.
However, regardless of
how amazing the cast may
be, I can’t bring myself
to believe that there were
no suitable Asian opera
performers who could do
just as good a job, not
only as the lead role, but
also various supporting
roles. Given the number
of diverse roles that have
been stolen from the
BAME community over
centuries, I can’t quite get
past this overlook in this
day and age.
ICSM Drama Presents: TRAP
D
uring my time
at Imperial,
becoming a
part of ICSM
Drama has been one of
the greatest joys of my
university life. Unfortu-
nately, for the last cou-
ple of years, I haven’t
been able to be nearly
as involved as I would
have liked to be, be-
cause, you know, life
got in the way.
Regardless of my par-
ticipation, over the years
I have witnessed ICSM
Drama greatly diversify
their repertoire. Gone are
the days of staging classics
likeAMidsummer Night’s
Dream and The Crucible
(both of which were fan-
tastic productions, having
produced the latter one
myself). ICSM Drama
has opted for surrealist
interpretations of Lorca’s
Blood Wedding last year,
and most recently, a
documentary-style super-
natural thriller in the form
of TRAP.
TRAP takes place in a
town where all audience
and cast members of a
local high school play
have fallen unconscious.
The mystery behind this
strange occurrence is
slowly unravelled through
documentary-style inter-
views with witnesses, first
responders and more, as
well as re-enactments of
the events leading up to
the performance night.
The first act is almost
exclusively made up of
brief monologues by those
involved in the incident
in one way or another.
Although a promising
idea, this makes it hard to
care about the characters’
experiences of the events,
as each small monologue
feels disconnected from
the rest, and is a bit too
brief to dig deep into the
characters’ psyche.
The second act is con-
siderably more exciting
as the characters start
engaging in the action and
solving the mystery rather
than simply providing
monologue after mono-
logue. The addition of im-
mersive elements dotted
throughout the second
act also helps elevate the
show, giving it a more
fresh and exciting feel.
Near the end, the
show gets very meta, and
perhaps painfully so. A
lot of it is quite predict-
able, and perhaps a little
cheesy. However, there
are some carefully planted
seeds and tricks that pay
off wonderfully.
This is in no small
part thanks to Alexandra
Santos’ skillful direction.
Santos employs excellent
use of the UCH stage,
brings the best out of her
cast and makes the most
out of the underwhelming
script. The cast is ex-
cellent; some highlights
include Max Fursman
who is both hilarious and
vulnerable and Frankii
Watson, who shines in
every scene she is in.
Both Ceara Harper and
Rania Selim also display
incredible dedication
to ICSM Drama, with a
committed fall that looked
like it would mess up the
knees, and a vocal-cord
rupturing scream which
deafened me for a good
thirty seconds.
The lighting team were
exquisite working to
produce by far the most
ambitious and challenging
lighting design ICSM
Drama has ever attempt-
ed. This all pays off, as the
result completely elevates
the play.
In short, TRAP is a gor-
geously staged, directed
andactedplay.Itisashame
that the script, which has
some excellent elements,
doesn’t quite match up
with the talent on display.
Regardless, ICSM Drama
deserved to be applauded
for taking risks with their
choices of play and fol-
lowing through with these
choices to result in a fresh,
original end product.
