E
qual: How we fix
the gender pay
gap by Carrie
Grace
This book entails
Carrie Grace’s account of
her challenging unequal
pay at BBC. It started in
the summer of 2017 when
a list of the top-earners in
BBC was released, with
white men dominating the
top of the list. This came
as a surprise to Carrie
Grace, the China editor of
BBC News, who discov-
ered she was underpaid
in comparison to fellow
international editors - the
only thing she demanded
when taking on the role
was to be paid equally as
the North American editor
- whom now she found
out - earned double. Thus
sparked her quest of equal
pay in BBC, her resigna-
tion, and BBC’s eventual
apology.
The culture of pay
secrecy gives way to pay
discrimination - if you do
not know how much your
peers are making, how do
you know if you’re paid
equally? The topic of
unequal pay is not a new
one, but I have never had
the chance to learn much
beyond the legislation and
statistics (most of which
centers around gender pay
gap, which is not the same
thing), and the natural
assumption that with the
laws implemented this
is no longer an issue.
However, there’s more
to that needs to be done
to make the world listen.
This book sheds light
upon more details on
the subject matter, most
of which center around
Gracie’s case, but it also
includes a practical guide
and resources to respond
to workplace inequality
near the end of the book.
In short, Equal is a
deep, gripping read on
the topic of equal pay. In
many parts, it’s almost
infuriating to see how
difficult it could be to be
heard, and how difficult
it is to ask for something
to demand an inherent
human right.
Invisible Women:
Exposing Data Bias
in a World Designed
for Men by Caroline
Criado-Perez
Invisible Women, as
the title suggests, covers
the systematic gender
data bias in the history
of our knowledge, which
is the root of perpetual
discrimination against
women. It’s profound,
provocative, and depress-
ing in many ways. The
book encompasses a vast
range of topics, from the
public transport system
to toilets, from scientific
research to architecture.
It’s eye-opening to see for
the sake of convenience
how often women are
ignored and neglected,
with males being “the
default human.” It really
shows how our everyday
life can be and is affected
by the decisions made
with that assumption - it
doesn’t tell you things you
already know. Despite its
wide coverage, the book
maintains a well-or-
ganised structure and
coherence throughout that
makes it easy to read.
Last summer when I
worked with laboratory
rats as an in vivo model
for drug development
purposes, I noticed that
only male rats are used
- because female rats
have menstruation and
are “harder to manage,”
because that’s the way the
model is, because that’s
just the way things are. I
could not help but wonder
its implications of this
widely accepted practice
in biological research
- the extrapolation of
this data onto humans.
This inspired me to pick
up the book as soon as
it’s released, and in it,
Criado-Perez addressed
this issue alongside many
others that need to be
looked into.
Criado-Perez has
written a compelling nar-
rative on a very significant
matter. It’s an ambitious
project to take on, but she
has executed it flawlessly.
The level of research
and statistics included
are incredible. It’s a long
battle to fight, and I do
hope those in positions
of influence can read this
book.
No One Is Too Small
to Make A Difference
by Greta Thunberg
No One Is Too Small
to Make A Difference by
Greta Thunberg has taken
the bookstore display
windows by storm upon
its release. It is a collec-
tion of eleven speeches
from Thunberg, a Swedish
teenager who protests for
climate change outside
the Swedish parliament.
The central idea surrounds
the urgency of climate
change and the need for
radical changes to be
made. She also explained
the straightforward logic
behind her school strike
and civil disobedience.
Her speech may be
somewhat repetitive
but is nevertheless very
powerful. As the forefront
of the climate movement,
Thunberg has unbeliev-
able influence and also
been the target of critics
- whether she was used is
another topic for later.
One thing to note is that
Thunberg insisted that we
already know what to do,
the urgent call now is to
do the right thing. In the
future, I hope Thunberg
goes more in-depth with
the details as to what kind
of changes we want to
make - is it only the duty

of politicians? Aren’t sus-
tainable business models
and changes in decision
making within industries
more impactful? Below is
an excerpt from the book
for you to have a feel of
Thunberg’s passion:
“Adults keep saying:
‘We owe it to the young
people to given them
hope.’ But I don’t want
your hope. I don’t want
you to be hopeful. I want
you to panic. I want you
to feel the fear I feel every
day.And then I want you
to act.I want you to act
as you would in a crisis. I
want you to act as if our
house is on fire. Because
it is.”
