A Response to “How dare I?”, on Ecological
Misconception
Julio Garcia-Perez (mathematics) argues that Alberto Begue’s piece (Sustainability, Felix 1745)
paints a strawman fairy-tale of Greta Thunberg’s ideology
COMMENT

Comment Writer
L
ast week, Alberto
Begue wrote an
article on the
ecological move-
ment represented by Greta
Thunberg. The goal of the
article seemed to be to
“destroy” what the author
believes to be the ideas
most ecologists support
with facts and logic. After
reading it I was somewhat
confused, as what he
was writing against does
not really represent the
movement and barely
any reasoned arguments
against ecologism were
provided. In this article I
will show how Alberto’s
idea of climate activists
is mistaken, what some
of our (my) real ideas are,
superficially dispute the
eco-neoliberal fairy-tale
(for the nth time) and
talk about the reactionary
figure of the “politically
incorrect knight” in our
times.
At the beginning of
the article, the author
states in some way that
he is concerned with the
environment. To do this
he highlights his love
for numerous animals,
flowers and all those sorts
of things that do just one
thing: infantilise and trivi-
alise the ecological cause.
By associating climate
activists like Greta with
people who, for some
reason, really like nature
you are equating it to a
hobby. Would someone
dare compare our sacred
economy with coin col-
lecting? No. So I would
suggest that if the author
wants to be taken (not
saying that he is not)
as someone concerned
by the climate crisis
(yes, crisis, not change),
he could at avoid this
unnecessary trivialising
remark. Again, being
ecologically concious is
not about having a passion
for the wonders of mother
earth, but to see that if we
keep going like we are,
we are all fucked; and I
cannot think of something
more critical to his own
concerns.
After this self-recog-
nition as a nature lover
(which is more than I can
assert), Alberto proceeds
to present to us what he
believes the “Greta cult”
(what many reactionaries
would probably call
ecologists these days)
mean by ecologism.
Central to this insulting
caricature is the idea of
overpopulation and what
he calls “mass suicide”
(plausible if Seneca was
a top selling author).
Alberto’s incorrect claim
that this is something
most ecologists advocate
is precisely a bastard
idea of the neoliberalism
he so much loves and
social Malthusian ideas
(that the Nazis so happily
inherited). Capitalism has
for decades imposed an
individualist conception
of ecological conscience
based on blaming each of
us for our lack of “green”
behaviour in our day to
day life. Yes, that is right,
you, who uses plastic
straws, are as responsible
as Shell for the climate
crisis. Once accepted this
personal responsibility,
it is (not so) reasonable
to jump, as Alberto does,
to population control
and genocide, which, as
I mentioned are usually
establishment to avoid
the masses from realising
that a hundred companies
are responsible for 70% of
the contamination of the
planet, and genocide is
just an alternative measure
that punishes (kills!) the
powerless instead of the
powerful.
After the above consid-
erations, you can probably
understand why I was
confused when I read that
I am “obviously the heir
of those who wanted to
sterilise populations”. A
movement that challenges
a threat to the survival
of humans cannot argue
for their extermination!
Maybe the author has yet
to realise that the climate
crisis does not only kill
cute animals like the
dolphins and elephants he
cites, but also humans, es-
pecially the destitute. It is,
indeed, the “third” world
(it exists!) that is suffering
the most the consequences
of the wrongdoing of the
usual suspects. This is the
reason why movements
like Extinction Rebellion
put emphasis in showing
the ecological issues that
these countries experi-
ence and the West cannot
be bothered with (unless
it is to despoil them or
enslave them) . We, or at
least I, argue is that it is a
few companies in the (un)
developed Western world,
supported by the political
class and the privileges of
the (un)free market that
are responsible for our
current crisis. Note that
this is a shift from the
individualist eco-shaming
invented by neoliberalism
to a structural critique of
the system, one that most
of us can adhere to. Once
this different critique
has been established, we
of “growth”, and we all
know that “growth” is
good, or do we? Accord-
ing to Alberto, the closest
synonym of economic
growth would be tech-
nological progress. I am
slightly sceptical of this,
the neoliberal world is not
known for putting tech-
nological progress first,
but profit maximalization
(or so my Mathematics
of Economics module
suggests). This is a point
that is sometimes difficult
to come to terms with:
technological progress
is only a by-product of
companies’ goal to make
cash, and therefore,
subjected and obstructed
by it. The development
of technology would be
better focused and more

“He highlights
his love for
numerous
animals,
flowers ... that
infantilise
and trivialise
the ecological
cause”
could jump, like Alberto
did, to the different con-
clusion that we should
destroy these few com-
panies or even destroy
the system, instead of
destroying every human.
This is again a caricature
that so many economy
lovers love to criticise.
But the truth is we are not
even asking for a system
destruction (the wettest of
my anti capitalist dreams),
but for a system change.
The other main idea
Alberto seems to assign
to the “Greta cult” is
“degrowth”. The term
itself is curious enough,
as like anything that
challenges the sacred cow
that is the economy, it had
to be coined in a negative
fashion as the antagonism
present in reactionary
far right sectors, as the
ideal way of ending with
each of us eco-sinners.
Individual eco-shame is
yet another effort by the
