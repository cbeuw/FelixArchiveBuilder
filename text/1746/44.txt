A revolutionarily
simple beauty routine
discovered by research-
ers at Imperial College
London has taken the
cosmetics industry by
storm by allowing people
to take decades off of their
appearance.
Initially treated as a
waste product, the red
lanyards issued to first
year students upon arrival
at Imperial were treated
with contempt and often
discarded. On any day
in South Kensington
one could expect to see
several lanyards blowing
in the wind, caught on
railings or on gutters.
All this changed when
research assistant and
manhole cover collector
Feb Senton discovered the
nigh on magical proper-
ties of the lanyard.
According to the paper
published last week in the
Journal of the American
Society of Whitehead
Squeezers the discovery
was a matter of chance.
Senton, after suffering a
particularly bad attack of
his periodic and debilitat-
ing acne while at work in
Blackett and struggling
to carry the mountains of
undergraduate problem
sheets and notes to the
incinerator, grabbed a
lanyard to hold his card.
He needn’t have bothered.
As he walked, contrary
to his normal experience,
doors were held open for
him, people in lifts didn’t
block him from entering
and no one spat on him as
they walked by. Instead
he was greeted warmly
by the very first year
undergraduates whose
notes he was going to
destroy. They asked him
what course he was doing,
how he was finding his
first year and whether he
agreed that Feb Senton
was a disgusting hunch-
backed one-eyed wretch
that stank more like
rotting flesh than Mexico
City’s waterways during
election season. The paper
does not record Senton’s
reply but it does note that
the first year students
were entirely taken in by
the cuckoo among them.
Unfortunately Senton
was not able to benefit
from his discovery.
After reporting it to his
superiors the lanyard was
snatched off him.
In an interview
with Negafelix Senton
admitted that he tried to
attend the underwater
touch-rugby game that he
had been invited to by the
undergraduate friends he
made but they had driven
him away by throwing
stones at him.
The discovery has
prompted an extraordi-
nary surge in entrepre-
neurship among both
staff and students and a
thriving black market in
the now valuable com-
modities. However, this
discovery has also made
some freshers worry for
their safety.
Scandal shook the
Chemistry department
after a cabal of senior
lecturers were brought
in for questioning after
being accused of using
expensive lab equipment
and fake offers of UROPs
to round up students and
nick their lanyards. A
spokesman issued a state-
ment to the press on the
steps of Sherfield after the
group were released from
the security office on bail.
“I can categorically tell
everyone assembled here
that my clients are not
guilty of any crime other
than trying to educate
keen young students”.
Her point was somewhat
undermined by the fact
that two of the alleged
undergraduate trappers
were being held in the
arms of babysitters and
had to have their nappies
changed during the trial.
The Senior Manage-
ment of the College
Professor Button before and after new Imperial Red Lanyard treatment // HalloweenExpress/NeedPix
welcomed the publishing
of the paper calling it
“more evidence of Impe-
rial’s world class status
as a centre of research
excellence.” The press
conference took a turn for
the worse, however, after
it was announced that the
university aspect of the
Imperial brand would be
being wound down. “We
are looking forward to
diversifying the Imperial
portfolio and feel that
it is not in our interests
to remain in the tertiary
education market. After
all we are going to make
so much money off this
lanyard discovery we
don’t have to waste our
time on your losers”.
Editors note: They are
shutting us down! but
Negafelix will never die!
Join the resistance!
Studies show that wearing a red lanyard can make you look 18 again!
