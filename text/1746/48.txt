“All atheletes
competed
incredibly,

for Imperial”

4th February 2020
was a Valentines like
no other. Storming
North with Dennis
was Imperial’s team of 17
indomitable fighters after
enduring two months of
hard training, harrowing
exams and deadlines.
Disembarking the coach
at Nottingham after a
three-hour journey, the
team settled down for the
night in preparation for
the big day ahead – British
Universities and Colleges
Sport (BUCS) Winter
Championships.
An unimaginably early
awakening on the 15th
saw them join 42 rival
universities from across
the nation at David Ross
Sports Village, Notting-
ham. This is the second
competition of the series,
which together constitutes
Western Europe’s largest
student martial art and
for every single sparring
match win. Patterns round
progressed at every event
in the tournament series
towards their club’s
Overall Student National
Taekwondo Champion-
ships ranking at the end of
the year. The club with the
highest total points fol-
lowing the Series Finals
are crowned overall
National Champions!
All athletes competed
incredibly, winning a total
of 10 medals for Imperial.
Gold medalists – George
Doran and Menghan Liu
in sparring and poomsae
respectively. Silver
medalists – Joon-Ho
Son, Sharmila Rana, Tara
Sassel all sparring. Bronze
medallists – Angela Sun,
Jaafar Rammal (first
time competitor!), Sojin
Park, Wenbo Chen and
Wim Geberbauer, all in
sparring.
Special congratulations
go to George Doran for
his gold achievement
in the A class category
sparring, returning to the
sport after more than two
years and Jaafar Rammal
for his bronze medal in
his first ever Taekwondo
competition having
only joined the club this
academic year.
First-time fighters
Charmaine Chue, Judy
Kim, Nicholas Yap and
Winnie Chang all fought
withstrongspirits,looking
forward to win medals in
the next championship.
Special mentions to
Syazana Hisham who
sadly missed out on a
medal and Nesha Vruti,
Xinyu Bai and Leona Li
who kindly volunteered to
help on the day.
Imperial Taekwondo
currently sits at 3rd place
for Indomitable Team
Trophy and 4th Overall
Championships Results.
We thank our instructors
and coaches, instructor
Christopher Dancel, for
their continuous support
throughout the years for
this achievement.

H
ow beautiful
is it to gather
with friends
and family to
show them what you love
doing?
That is exactly what
happened last Saturday!
We had an amazing show
at Ethos swimming pool
for our friends and family
(full house!!), we also
invited the synchronised
swimming teams from the
University of Nottingham
and University of Bristol.
What a treasured ex-
perience it was to show
and see routines from all
the clubs, from beginners
and more advanced
swimmers, and celebrate
afterwards with all the
guests. They all had the
chance to join us in the
water for a synchro tester
session!
Being in the club for a
few months now, it was so
incredible to hear the loud
cheers and the clap of the
teams for one another.
This sport has brought us
together, to laugh together
and support one another!
