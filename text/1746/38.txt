SSDD: Looks
like things
never really
change around
here. During
the ‘Delving
into Imperial’s
HerStory’ event
in the Felix office
thispastMonday,
we also came
across a whole
wide range of
articles dating
back years about
rent disputes at
Imperial, from
this article in
1997 to stories
of rent strikes in
1985. We’re sure
they go back
further as well...
