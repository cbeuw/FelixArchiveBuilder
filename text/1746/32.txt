the reader
throughAI technology and
how it has the potential of
bring about a paradigm
shift in the use technol-
ogy to drive innovation,
however she also reveals
future risks and ethical
implications that we must
address before it is too
late. BIG BRAIN EVO-
LUTION is an insightful
glimpse into the world of
artificial intelligence (AI)
technology. Dr. Tempest,
a Cambridge University
lecturer of medical law
and ethics and long time
management consultant
draws from her vast ex-
perience in medicine and
technology to introduce
laymen-readers to the
technology.
The potential of AI as a
constructive societal force
highlights the vast amount
of untapped potential and
opportunity which lies
within the capabilities
of the technology. For
example the genetic
home-testing company
23andme now owned by
Alphabet, i.e. Google,
is collecting genetic
information of hundreds
of thousands of people.
The combination of one
of the largest global tech
companies and a treasure
trove of genetic data may
enable data scientists to
unlock the mystery of the
genetic code. An alterna-
tive use of the technology
lies in drug discovery with
companies like Benevo-
lentAI, which focus on the
developing new pharma-
ceuticals. BenevolentAI
plans on leveraging their
expertise in computer
science to develop an AI
based platform for drug
discovery. With high
throughput testing being
the standard method for
drug discovery, AI may
offer a method to cut
down the need of testing
thousands of compounds
for efficacy.
Dr. Tempest describes
how the data driven
Obama campaign and
how it changed the way
in which presidential
campaigns are run today.
While Obama was the
most consequential
American president of this
millennium, in the future
we may encounter digital
candidates, and I do not
mean Hilary Clinton. The
“The system
hopes to
deliver bias
free policy on
central issues
like healthcare,
climate
change, and
education”
“An
individual’s
Facebook likes
may represent
a better
familiarity
with a person
than their
spouse would
show”
digital presidential can-
didate AI Alice received
25,000 votes in Russia’s
presidential election. The
system hopes to deliver
bias free policy on central
issues such as healthcare,
climate change and educa-
tion. Tempest does not shy
away from demonstrating
to the reader how some
companies take advantage
of AI technology instead
of using it for altruisti-
cally.
Tempest also writes
about those who are
unfortunately taking
advantage of AI technol-
ogy, using it for nefarious
purposes. One of the most
famous examples being
Cambridge Analytica ille-
gitimately taking the data
of millions of Facebook
users to support Donald
Trump’s presidential
campaign. Users’ unfazed
by privacy concerns are
creating loopholes for
data broker companies
to collect personal and
intrusive data on indi-
viduals, which they are
permitted to sell on to
3rd parties. “Data brokers
operate behind a veil of
secrecy” Tempest warns,
with advertisers and pol-
iticians taking advantage
of potentially vulnerable
consumers.
It is postulated that an
individual’s Facebook
likes may represent a
better familiarity with
a person than their own
spouse would show. As
consumers, Tempest
writes, we interact with
machine learning algo-
rithms on a daily basis,
be it through Instagram,
Spotify or Amazon. While
individual algorithms
dictate what music we
listen to, the news we read
and what products we buy
the future may become
even more intrusive.
The neurotechnology
company Neuralink for
example is currently
developing implantable
brain machine interfaces.
According to its founder
Elon Musk one of the
central issues facing
people today is the limited
speed at which we can
transmit and receive data.
Imagine moving away
from your two thumbs or
10 fingers to having your
whole brain operating
electronic devices. While
the prospects of having
improved brain-ma-
chine interfaces sounds
tempting, it inevitably
will expose even more
human vulnerabilities to
those willing to exploit
them.
Any well informed
citizens we must be made
aware of the potential
benefits and risks that lie
in artificial intelligence
and technology, because
awareness is the only way
reduce its future misuse.
Tempest therefore
outlines both sides of the
argument and allowing for
the reader to draw their
own conclusions on the
subject.
