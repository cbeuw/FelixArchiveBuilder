Riot has Revealed Further Details of ‘Project A’ –
Valorant – Including Release Date!
During Riot Games’ 10 Year Anniversary broadcast, they shocked the gaming sphere by announcing a litany of
new games under development – and one might be coming sooner than we thought

I
’m a massive League
of Legends nerd,
and so was extraor-
dinarily excited
when Riot revealed a
myriad of games during
their 10th anniversary
broadcast a few months
back – splurging two
whole pages of fanboyism
into this Games section as
a result. So, imagine the
paroxysms of joy I fell
into when they revealed
this week that the previ-
ously mysterious ‘Project
A’ would be coming this
summer already.
With a newly-revealed
title, Valorant looks to be
an exciting addition to
a genre of games which
often seems over-saturat-
ed: first person shooters.
They are perhaps the
most popular format for
triple-A gaming releases,
due to their high-octane
action, relatively intuitive
control schemes, ease of
execution on both console
and PC, and – above all –
their variety in tone from
ultra-competitive esports
titles to single-player
casual experiences.
From the information
revealed this week,
Valorant seems to lean
towards the former. Riot
has taken strong cues from
bothCounterstrike:Global
Offensive (CS:GO) – the
oldschool tactical shooter
that maintains one of the
world’s biggest esports
scenes – and from Over-
watch (OW), the 2017
hero-shooter title which,
despite recent fall-offs and
glaring mistakes made by
developers Blizzard, was
still hugely impactful on
the industry as a whole.
They seem to be pri-
oritising the tight-knit,
high-precision gunplay of
CS:GO in terms of core
gameplay, stressing over
and over that a clean,
competitive style was
their focus. Although the
player does pick a ‘hero’
character with abilities
– each distinct from one
another – abilities (as
well as weapons) have
to be ‘bought’ with an
economy system, similar-
ly to CS:GO’s economy
mechanics. So while
on a surface level the
hero-shooter element is
more reminiscent of OW,
the mechanics of how it
works – the way they’ve
executed the concept –
still leans closer to CS:GO
in this regard. The abilities
“Riot has taken
strong cues
from CS:GO,
prioritising
tight-knit
high-precision
gunplay”
themselves are relatively
low-power, more similar
to buying equipment such
as smoke grenades than to
the flashy and explosive
ults that define OW or
LoL.
This also reflects in
the big industry names
they’ve been consulting
with – rumours are
abound that high-profile
streamers and esports pros
from the shooter scene,
such as Shroud, have been
invited to Riot’s studios
for feedback sessions.
They’ve taken other
lessons from their success
with LoL, however,
including the importance
of resource-unintensive
design – in other words,
you can run this game on
a freaking toaster. Where
their experience devel-
oping the world’s most
popular competitive game
really shines, however,
is in their dedication to
behind-the-scenes devel-
opment.
As you can tell from
the above, Valorant’s core
gameplay cycles are not
highly original. It’s easy
to draw comparisons to
other games, meaning it
fits neatly into a unique
niche that nonetheless is
sandwiched by industry
giants. What is truly
exceptional is this behind-
the-scenes stuff. So let’s
dive into what separates
Valorant from its stiff
competition.
For starters, it will run
on a 128-tickrate server.
In simple terms, that
means the server speaks to
your computer 128 times a
second. This is double that
of its closest competitors,
CS: GO and Rainbow Six:
Siege (RSS), and up to six
times that of other games
such as Apex Legends.
It’s clear why this is
beneficial to any gamer
– the more regularly in-
formation is being shared
between different players’
computers and the server,
the less ‘lag’ there will be
between different inputs
and outputs (such as you,
or an enemy, shooting at
and killing eachother.)
Of course, this is
expensive to run. You
flat-out need more and
better servers to handle it.
Lucky, then, that Riot is –
and I quote some random
on Reddit – “rich af” from
developing and peddling
LoL for a solid decade.
Another piggyback
from their LoL experience
is that Valorant will also
use the internet infrastruc-
ture set up by Riot for
their LoL servers. Without
delving into detail, Riot
has cut lots of deals with
ISPs to prioritise their
internet traffic, ensuring
lower ping for players.
Ping describes the
length of time it takes a
packet of information to
get from your computer
to the server and back.
The higher your ping,
the laggier the game.
Reducing it, then, is
essential to competitive
integrity.
This also has a huge
affect on ‘peeker’s advan-
tage’– and I reference you
to PC Gamer’s “Riot is
on a crusade to eradicate
‘peeker’s advantage’ in its
new FPS Valorant” article
here to get a good expla-
nation of how that works.
In short, due to the lag in
information between your
computer, which transfers
to the server, which then
transfers to an opposing
player’s computer, often
the first player to move
into the line of sight
of another has a strong
advantage over that other
player. This has been a
nightmare for shooter
players for years.
That aforementioned
term – ‘competitive in-
tegrity’ - really seems to
be Riot’s ultimate priority
here, and is the basis on
which they hope to steal
market share from com-
petitors which have his-
torically been plagued by
dodgy servers… or, more
nefariously, by h4x0rz.
Hax. Hacks.
This is where things
get really sweet. Riot
have designed their own
anti-cheat systems right
into the code of the game.
I’ll borrow an example
from a PC Gamer article
I referenced while writing
this up:
Wallhacks – where
players trick the game
into letting them see
through walls and thus
knowing where everyone
on the map is at all times
– have been targeted by
implementing a ‘fog of
war’ system, which is
another borrow from
LoL. In that game, you
can’t see enemies until
they’re a certain distance
from you or a friendly
unit. While that isn’t the
case in Valorant – don’t
worry, you can still camp
sniper alley – what they
have done is make it so
the server doesn’t even
tell your computer where
enemies are until just
before they’re visible
to you. Even if you can
see through walls, it
won’t help, because your
computer won’t know
where anyone is.
Sick stuff.
We’ll have to wait and
see whether just having a
fairer, more competitive
game will be enough to
distinguish Valorant from
its rivals – rivals which
are deeply established
in the gaming industry
and community. The
gameplay itself, I fear,
will not be unique enough
– but despite that, I’m
keen to try it out in just a
few months.
