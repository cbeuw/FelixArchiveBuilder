New Hall?
The prospect of a new Hall of Residence for IC came a step closer
on Monday when the results of a feasibility study were unveiled at
a special residence meeting.
The study proposes the
building of a 147 bedroom
residence above the existing
sports centre in Princes Garden.
The facade and height are
designed to blend in with the
adjoining terraced houses.
The significant problems to be
faced are planning permission
and finance. College Secretary,
John Smith, intends to consult
local residents so that any
development can fit in with their
wishes.
Part of the finance for the £4m
project may come from gravel
excavations at Imperial's
Harlington Sports Ground, with
the remainder being loan
financed.
The plans for the interior
consist of a number of alternative
room schemes. The most
luxurious has shower and basin
en suite, and at the other extreme
are Southside-style study
bedrooms. The scheme shows
one kitchen per eight rooms.
Otherwise the provision for
communal areas is minimal,
although no plans have yet been
finalised. In planning common
rooms and T V lounges, the
College will want to ensure that
nuisance to neighbours is
minimised.
It is not yet clear whether the
hall will be used by undergrads or
postgrads, but part of the reason
for building a residence to a
higher standard than Southside is
to attract a higher income from
summer users. This clearly
precludes a P G only hall.
The Union representative at
the meeting supported the view
that a higher standard of campus
residence is desirable, and
suggested that some wealthier
students could afford the extra
rent involved.

New Rector
Professor Eric Ash is to be the new Rector of Imperial College, it
was announced at Governing Body on Friday. Ash, at present
Head of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering
at University College London, will take up the appointment on 1
October 1985.
After taking a BSc and PhD at
IC in the early fifties Ash did
research at Stanford and Q M C ,
later becoming a research
engineer at Standard Tele-
communications. In 1963 he
became a lecturer at U C L and
was made professor in 1967.
Professor Ash turned down the
opportunity to apply for several
vice-chancellorships before
agreeing to be considered for the
Rectorship of IC because it was
'most challenging j o b in
academia—at least on the science
side'.
In an interview with F E L I X
Professor Ash stated he had 'a
passionate interest in teaching

Exhibition
A n e x h i b i t i o n of N e w
Technology in Biotechnology is
currently being held by Nature
magazine at the Novotel,
Hammersmith.
Exhibits range from ferment-
ers to sterilisers, from incubators
to automatic liquid handlers.
Of particular interest are
Applied Biosystems who have
machines on display that can
sequence proteins automatically,
and another which synthesises
high-purity, high-yield oligo-

Analytical Measuring Systems
Ltd are exhibiting their image
analysis equipment. A scanner
mounted on a microscope
produces a T V screen image of,
say, a culture specimen. The
operator defines the area of
interest and, at the touch of a
button, the machine gives you the
colony count in that area.
LH Fermentation are the only
British Fermenter manufacturer
with a display. They already have
a good share of the U K market,
but at present are trying to
expand abroad. Their products
are made entirely from British
steels and raw materials.

standards'. He added that
promotion in universities must
be based on teaching and not just
research. He is critical of the
present government's policies on
higher education. 'I have, of
course, read the green paper, but
not with any great enthusiasm..
..What I found immensly
depressing is the view that the
resources we are devoting to
higher education can, at best, be
kept constant. In spite of
everything this is an affluent
Professor Ash
society and education has a value
quite apart from its ability to
back up industry'. However he
also said 'I believe we have no
alternative but to redirect our
resources towards the applied
sciences.'
Professor Ash is said by
colleagues to be hard-working,
quick-thinking and easy to get on
with.
IC Union Pesident Elect Carl
Burgess welcomed the appoint-
ment and wished Professor Ash
well in his new job. He added that
in his view Prof Ash was very
easy to get on with.
