CEFE
and tin*
Jews
Sir,—/ read with interest
the article in CEFE (not the
article in the new opinion
page of Felix) regarding
letter bombs vis a vis Arab
Terrorists and Israeli "ter-
rorists". The article basically
states that the letter bombs
have been organised by the
Israeli Government and asso-
ciated Zionist organisations
in an attempt to bring the
Black September Movement
and other admitted terrorist
organisations into disrepute.
I cannot argue with their
"facts". I assume CEFE is
the omnipotent power of
truth, i.e. I give them the
benefit of the doubt.
However, I do question
their logic. Am I to believe
that some arbitrary Jews are
lying 6 feet under due to
some arbitrary propaganda
organised by some arbitrary
forces within Israel? Am f
to believe that the Israeli
Government has hired alleged
Arabs (or well-disguised
Jews; the resemblance as a
race, and not a religion, is
not coincidence) to hijack
planes? Am I to believe the
Israeli government sacrificed
its athletes in Munich as a
propaganda exercise? Am I to
believe that God-knows-how-
many Jews were gassed in
Germany as a political exer-
cise in propaganda, or that
the persecution of the Jewish
race in the Bible (taken as
an important historical docu-
ment and not as mere reli-
gion. A great deal of it has
been substantiated from
other sources) is yet another
con? Perhaps the Jews drove
' themselves from Egypt and
drowned half of their number
in the Red Sea.
I await a reply from CEFE
saying "Yes!" Come on bud-
dies, be realistic, emerge
from your naivete.
Of course, the nation of
Israel is surrounded by criti-
cism and opposition. Perhaps
the decisions made in 1916
and 1948 were wrong. But,
alas, the population of Israel
is 100% behind the Israeli
government's attitudes to-
wards the surrounding Arab
countries. Sorry, I neglected
the Palestinian refugees, Why
don't the Arab nations offer
to help the refugees? Is it
because they would lose a
political weapon, one of the
very few they have? Why
also don't the Israelis give
back the territories they won
in their little sortie of 5 years
ago? Yeah, sure. And leave
themselves open to the same
kind of genocide threat as
before. It is always said that
Jews aren't stupid; in this
case they certainly are not.
Of course, whose land is
"Israel"? Well let me say
this:
All "Europeans" get out of
America, leave it to the "In-
dians". "Indians", get out
of America, back across the
Alentian Islands, back to
Asia from whence you came.
Leave America to the
Buffalo.
English, get out of Eng-
land, back to the Continent
(what price the EEC now,
buddy? ).
Irish, you can solve all
your problems, come back
to England with the Welsh
and Scots, this is your coun-
try, but you ran away. Cape
Coloureds of South Africa,
send the whites back to
Europe, and once they have
gone, go back to your own
lands further north.
Time is a great healer, my
friends, I hope you can sur-
vive long enough to heal
yourselves.
Yours T.T.C.C.H*

"The Felix linguistic ex-
pert says that these hiero-
glyphs probably mean "Till
the cows come home", but it
is open to other interpreta-
tions.
Lager:
further
opinions
Sir,—/ would like, first of
all, to congratulate and thank
Mr. Martin Doughty for his
article, "The Great Lager
Rip-Off", which is more than
overdue, it only being a pity
that his enlightenment should
be limited to students of I.C.
May I, however make two
points:
1) To be fair to the name
of Carlsberg we must differ-
entiate between draught
Carlsberg, as said brewed
and marketed by Watneys,
and Carlsberg HOF (or "ex-
port"), also draught, which is
not only brewed in the Carls-
berg Breweries in Copen-
hagen but also begged there,
and exported in this form.
2) This is in my experi-
ence, albeit that this can in
no way be said to include
Central London, retailed in
outlets, normally free houses,
roughly comparable in num-
ber to Whitbread's Stella
Artois.
The difference between
these two brews, apart from
being obvious to anyone who
has had the fortune to sample
them, is made in the pump-
head decoration; the HOF
variety having an actual
model of a Copenhagen mer-
maid sitting on a rock, cover-
ed by a canopy, which in
fact now proclaims the word
HOF, until a few months ago
it was "Export"; as opposed
to the Watney's Carlsberg
which just uses a plastic pic-
torial form of the aforemen-
tioned mermaid.
Otherwise thank you for
an excellent article.
Yours faithfully,
Richard G. King,

Sir.—This letter is about
the disgraceful way the
Chairman at Thursday's
U.G.M. handled the meet-
ing after the discussion on
the Murray Report. In par-
ticular he refused to ack-
nowledge the fact that the
Quorum was being chal-
lenged on two separate
occasions.
On the first occasion he
"Refused to hear" the chal-
lenge while the Academic
Affairs Officer, Mr. Doh-
erty, came over to me to
explain that the motion had
to be decided by the next
day. Following this motion
I again challenged the
Quorum by means of a
Point of Order. Mr. Black
then stated that a challenge
was not a point of order, I
was shouted down when I
tried to rephrase the chal-
lenge.
As a result of the actions
of the exec, outlined above
less than a hundred stud-
ents have committed the
4,000 students of I.C. to
supporting the students of
Stirling University and man-
dated our N.U.S. dele-
gates on a grants motion.
Whether one agrees with
the motions is unimportant
but what is important is
that the exec will conspire
to prevent a union member
exercising his constitutional
right to challenge the Quor-
um if they want a motion
to be passed.
(Mr. Black's objection to
my challenge being in a
Point of Order is invalid
since whether or not the
meeting is Quorate DOES
relate to the conduct of the
meeting and also Standing
Order 18(e) states:
18 With a motion before
the meeting the Chair-
man shall not allow a
member to rise ex-
cept: (e) to challenge
a quorum, which shall
be allowed at any
time in the meeting
even on a point of
order.)
Any union officer who
commits such a blatant in-
fringement of the constitu-
tion is not fit to hold office.
Yours sincerely,
R. F. Burton
