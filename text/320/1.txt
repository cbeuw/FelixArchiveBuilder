TRAG
But the peace
ended there
Mourning the death of
two members of the dele-
gation from Stirling uni-
versity, who were tragic-
ally killed in a car crash
ion the M6 en route to
Margate, the N.U.S. con-
ference opened on a mel-
ancholy note. The, assem-
bled members stood in
silence during a moving
ceremony in honour of the
ieceased delegates, all
their differences buried for
the moment as the whole
body of the N.U.S. joined
their thoughts, perhaps
lor the lasttimethis year,
to contemplate their com-
mon loss.
The peace ended there.
The conference got under
way, strikingly more
rowdy and disorganised
than last year.
THE HOUSING
MOTION
National rents strikes
were called for by the del-
egates who consider that
in addition the N.U.S.
and student unions must
negotiate the use of short
term council housing for
students. A national rent
strike was ordered for
January with a day of ac-
tion in February. Surpris-
ingly the conference did
not make any demands as
regards building of new
halls but concentrated its
efforts to increased grants
to cover the high cost of
living, brought about
largely by recent substan-
tial rent increases. The
attention of the conference
was drawn to Birmingham
hall fees, presently half as
much again as at I.C. It is
clear that government
money cannot be forth-
coming in every quarter
and the conference defin-
itely came down on the
side of money in our
pockets rather than halls
on our campus.
REPRESENTATION
A call for democratic
control of all Higher Edu-
cational establishments by
staff, students and local
community interests. As
with all other motions
there was a strong empha-
sis here on trade union in-
volvement in student
affairs.
GRANTS
The stress in the grants
motion lay in the argu-
ment that the T.U.C.
would not stand for the
money we get and so we
must ally with the trade
union movement and the
Labour party in order to
get grant increases. The
issue of student weekly
wages was shelved for the
time being as the confer-
ence felt that it should not
be pressed until the mass
of students were in favour.
It was pleasing to see the
delegates accepting, for
once, that on this issue
they did not enjoy the
support of the student
body. The aftermath of
this motion, however,
leaves us in no doubt that
the future of N.U.S. is des-
tined to lie with the
T.U.C.
Other motions to be
discussed, at the time of
going to press, are con-
ference reform, student
nurses and union auton-
omy.
Imperial College stu-
dents will be relieved to
hear that their delegates
are taking a very active
part in proceedings but
seem certainly to be fol-
lowing the left wing view
which marks the tone of
the whole conference. One
almost fears for the sur-
vival of the union man-
date or I've lost touch
with student feelings.
STUDENT PRESS
The student press since
arriving at Margate oan
only describe their treat-
ment as disgusting. The
national press representa-
tive, one Francis Bupa,
could see no point in
allowing any press seats
for student newspapers as
he considered "the Sun"
was more relevant to stu-
dents than any student
newspaper. (Would you
believe itâ€”Ed.). Conse-
quently he assigned thirty
press places for thirteen
"national" newspapers (in-
cluding the Margate
Herald and the Mar-
gate Examiner) and
tried to push all
the student press into side
seats where they couldn't
even hear, let alone see,
what was happening. Fol-
lowing a hard fought cam-
paign, during which much
bad language was thrown
about by our national
p r e s s representative,
(Francis to his friends, if
he's got any) with the aid
of Leslie Murphy, the stu-
dent press representative,
who perhaps should have
foreseen the problems, we
managed to get press seats
and so will be able to
bring you a full report of
the conference in Felix,
next week.

THE STACKRIDGE SOUND
Stackridge are a band that always have gone down
well on the college circuit, and Saturday night proved
to be no exception, when they played to a particularly
responsive audience. Unfortunately they were without
their beloved "Crun", who was in hospital at the time
having his appendix removed, but they managed to
get a bass player to replace him, although guitarist and
vocalist James Warren took his place whenever pos-
sible.
They started with a good stomping sound, followed
by "Tea Time," a quieter piece containing a flute solo
from Michael Slater, known to all as "Mutter".
"Anyone For Tennis", their new single, sounds de-
lightfully dated, and this, with fiddler Mike Evans'
singing, or rather screaming, of the Beatles classic,
"Twist and Shout", showed that they were entertain-
ers as well as musicians.
Several of Stackridge's songs are about fairyland
characters, and from their collection they produced the
sad story of "Syracuse the Elephant", and the tale of
the monster "Slark", which I thought was spoilt by
"Mutter's" looning in the middle.
They came back to do a medley of jigs for an
encore, much to the audience's delight, which "Mutter"
was hard pushed to keep pace with with his dust-bin
lid bashing, and they returned yet again to perform
"Dora The Female Explorer".
