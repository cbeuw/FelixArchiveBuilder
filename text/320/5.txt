PHOSPHOROUS THE JOBROT

PART THE FIRST
It had rained hard during the night, and
a large pool of muddy water lay dankly on
the potting shed roof. The roofing felt was
old and cracked, bulging between two sup-
ports. Beneath the bulge lay Phosphorous
the Jobrot, fast asleep. A smile decorated
his pleasantly ugly face, and his grubby
sleeping-bag rose and fell as he snored.
With a grunt he rolled over onto his back,
just in time to catch half a gallon of cold,
leafy water in the face.
"Major catastrophe!" he shouted, choking
and spitting out bits of tree and root, "dis-
aster strikes lone Jobrot — help urgently
required". Fortunately, it was not a disaster,
and when Phosphorous had woken up a bit,
and calmed down a lot, he was able to look
around his shed and take stock of the dam-
age.
A football-sized hole in the roof, and
rather damp bed seemed to be the
trouble.
"Not so bad", though Phosphorous, and
decided to get up. He struggled out of his
sleeping bag, and pulled on his much-
patched jeans, and King Canute tee-shirt.
"Time for breakfast" thought the Jobrot,
his mind conjuring with images of corn-
flakes, coffee and bacon. But it was riot to
be. A cold wave of reality washed over the
cornflakes and bacon, leaving only half a
jar of instant coffee—which was all he
had left in his food box.
"Oh! Nasty things!" he cursed, and sat
down inadvertently in the roof-disaster pool
of water.
"Oh! Very Nasty Things!" he cried, thor-
oughly disheartened.
There was only one solution; he would
have to go elsewhere for his breakfast. He
would go and see his friend Ferocious Din,
and scrounge some food from him. So he
pulled on his Moggle-fur coat, for it was
chilly outside, stuck a bucket under the hole
in the roof, and set off for Ferocious' house.
Despite his empty stomach, and the rather
depressing weather. Phosphorous felt quite
cheerful. He began to hum a little tune of
his own composition, and gave a leap in
the air at the end of every tenth bar. It was
already well into Autumn and everywhere
lay huge piles of fallen leaves. Phosphorous
ran, with a strange shuffling step, through
the leaves, shouting.
"I am the amazing Jobrot leaf plough".
To his surprise one of the piles contained
a large lump of tree, over which he fell, to
land glider-fashion on his nose.
He was not really hurt, but lay in the
leaves for a moment, musing on the cruelty
of fate. He was just dropping off to sleep,
when he remembered what he was doing
and where he was going. He got to his feet
and headed breakfastward once more.
Leaving the trees, he could see Ferocious'
place in the distance and broke into a trot.
Little legs whirring, Moggle-fur coat flying.
Phosphorous arrived breathless at Fero-
cious' front door. He read the brass plate
over the door :
"THIS CONVENIENCE OPENED
by ALDERMAN F. PAUNCH
15th September 1895"
Ferocious lived in a Public Loo. Most of
the fittings had been removed long ago, but
the walls were still tiled, and verdigris cov-
ered pipes snaked from floor to ceiling. At
the end of the main room was a small
cubicle, which offered "Wash and Brush-up
6d". Under the faded sign was a frosted
glass door, through which Phosphorous now
passed. Ferocious Din snored peacefully
inside. He was a long angular creature look-
ing in need of both services originally pro-
vided in his bedroom.
"Wake up, Ferocious", said Phosphorous,
a little nervously. There was no answer. "Oh
dear", thought Phosphorous, "WAKE U P "
he bellowed.
"Don't panic, women and Dins first, re-
member you're British", shouted Ferocious
sitting up very quickly. "Oh, it's only you,
dear boy", he said in more conversational
tones. "If you continue to wake me in that
heart-hammering fashion, I fear our friend-
ship may founder". The lean Din screwed
his monocle into his left eye and got up.
"You were wearing that thing in the other
eye yesterday", said Phosphorous, tact-
lessly.
"Possibly, dear lad, possibly", replied
Ferocious trying to'look haughty, "the afflic-
tion is never constant". Phosphorous knew
that his friend' wore the monocle for show
alone, but felt it unwise to say so.
Ferocious was peering hopefully into his
food cupboard.
" A spot of breakfast, perhaps?" he asked,
"That is what you came for I suppose?"
Muttering to himself Ferocious left it at
that, and set about pouring out the corn-
flakes, and cooking some bacon.
"Gosh no, Ferocious", lied the Jobrot, "I

came to see you".
"This is great", said Phosphorous, as the
two friends sat in Ferocious' living room,
drinking coffee, after an excellent breakfast.
"Quite possible, old chum, quite pos-
sible", murmured Din, his good humour res-
tored. Hardly had he spoken than there came
a knock at the door.
"Enter", said Ferocious, trying to look
as much like a householder as possible.
A short bulky individual came in. He wore
a long grubby raincoat, and carried, under
his arm, an old leather briefcase. From the
case he drew an official looking piece of
paper.
"Are you Ferocious Din, occupant of this
convenience?" he asked of Phosphorous the
Jobrot.
" N o " , said Phosphorous, quite truthfully.
The visitor glared suspiciously at Ferocious.
"What about you?" he said.
"Oh no", said Ferocious, "I'm his bro-
ther, 'Terrible' — can I help?"
"Well, I don't know" replied the man,
"you see I. have this Summons for him".
"Now you come to mention it" stam-
mered Ferocious, trying to keep the note of
panic out of his voice, "I recall he has gone
away on a very long holiday". But the Sum-
mons man was peering at the label on Fer-
ocious' cloak where it hung behind the door.
"Property of F. Din Esq." he read, "looks
like he forgot his coat, eh?"
"He's gone somewhere very warm", tried
Ferocious, "he doesn't need lit there".
"I don't believj) a word of it", growled
the representative of justice.
"Neither do I", said Phosphorous, mom-
entarily confused. It looked as if there was
going to be a nasty disagreement, but the
situation was saved by the strange plumb-
ing in Ferocious' living room. One of the
finely worked cisterns which lined the wall
teetered on its mounting and, still attached
to its pipe described a precise arc and
struck the Summons man unconscious.
"Oh gosh, terrible things", said Phos-
phorous, quite shocked. Callous Ferocious
Din was not so moved.
"I was going to fix that", he said, "what
a piece of luck, it rnight have fallen on me!"
But Phosphorous was kneeling beside the
Summons man.
"He's still alive", he said. "I can hear
his heart beating—help me get him into
your bedroom". Ferocious looked offended.
"I say, dear lad", he protested. "I don't
really want strange chaps on my bed: you
don't know where he's been . . . . " his
voice died away as Phosphorous leapt to
his feet, waving the Summons.
"Hey, look at this", he shouted, "it's not
the usual Loitering one, it says 'MAGIC
SUMMONS' on the top".
"You're right, dear boy, deuced intrigu-
ing", said Ferocious, snatching the Sum-
mons from Phosphorous' hand, "let me have
a close study of this document". Removing
his monocle to clear his vision. Ferocious
scanned the Summons and started to read:
"Magic Summons; drawn up this Sever-
alth day of Sometember, nineteen whatey-
few" (Eh? said Phosphorous — "It is a
magic summons" said Ferocious). "The
Summons" read Ferocious, "calls Ferocious
Din and Phosphorous the Jobrot ("Me too"
exclaimed Phosphorous, "so it would seem,
old son" replied Din), to take part in an
adventure of the highest quality. Adventur-
ers are advised to roll the Summons into a
tube of small dimensions and look down
one end.
"Well", thought Ferocious, "who do I
know who'd think that send me a
Magic Summons was a funny joke? He
stared suspiciously at Phosphorous. But the
Jobrot was peering excitedly at the Sum-
mons.
"Come on, Ferocious", he pleaded, "let's
try it — you know, roll it up and every-
thing".
"You try it, dear chap", said Ferocious,
offhandedly, "it all sounds terribly boring
to me".
While Phosphorous was fiddling with the
Summons, Ferocious mentally checked a list
of his friends for demented humorists.
" U m " , he pondered. It seemed too com-
plicated for Phosphorous' simple mind, and
yet it had his silly touch. "Dashed puzzling",
thought the untrusting Din. If it wasn't the
Jobrot then it had to be the appalling Cris-
pin Toads, whose strange sense of humour
had given Ferocious a lot of.trouble in the
past. It had been Crispin who had sent Fer-
ocious a postcard, expressing condolences
on the death of his pet worm, "Tonsil" pur-
portedly from the Queen. Din had just been
composing an appropriate reply to Her Ma>
esty when he had noticed that the original
was postmarked "Wandsworth". Yes it had
to be that objectionable Toads behind this
latest unlikely scheme. "What sort of idiot
does the nasty fellow think I a m ? " thought
Ferocious, "Magic Summons indeed —
pathetic!" He was plotting something fitting
as a Crispin-fooler when Phosphorous let out
a yell.
"Hey!" he shouted, "Treble Hey, ooh, ooh
Ferocious look, look, look at this". He was
peering down the rolled up Summons, and
waving his arms about.
"Restrain yourself, dear boy", murmured
Ferocious, thinking that perhaps Phosphor-
ous had got something to do with this silly
business after all — he was hamming it up
so much.
"No, look", said Phosphorous. "I can see
somewhere else down the Summons!"
"Come, come old friend", said Din, re-
assuringly, "all you should be able to see
down that thing is the none too salubrious
wall of my living room".
"Just look", said Phosphorous, thrusting
the rolled Summons into Ferocious' hand.
Slowly, and with an air of total unconcern.
Ferocious raised the Summons to* his un-
monooled eye.
"Well, I'll be disinfected", he gasped. His
monocle dropped, and swung on its string.
Through the rolled-up Summons Ferocious
could see a long sandy beach fringed with
palms, not unlike an advertisement in the
Sunday Times Colour Magazine. "I remain
speechless, dear chum, I am without com-
ment", said a pale Ferocious.
"Pretty fantastic isn't it?", said Phos-
phorous.
"Very splendid", replied Ferocious, low-
ering the Summons from his eye, "but it
doesn't really get us anywhere, does it? I
mean, it's a lovely party trick, done no doubt
with the proverbial mirrors, but it has no
real function, has it?" Phosphorous could
think of no immediate answer to this, but
he was still delighted with the Summons
even if it was only a toy.
"Let me have another go, Ferocious?"
he pleaded, "please".
"Just a moment, dear boy, I am studying
the phenomenon a little closer", Phosphor-
ous could contain himself no longer, and
reaching over to Ferocious, he stood on tip-
toe and looked down the free end of the
Summons.
"Oh lovely", he said, as the beach re-
appeared before him.
The two friends stood for a moment fac-
ing each other, looking down opposite ends
of the Magic Summons. Gradually the light
began to dim, the tiled walls began to
waver and wobble —to seem less like walls
than curtains. Suddenly, with a brilliant flash
of light, and a giant's breath rush of air,
the curtains were flung aside and vanished
completely — leaving Phosphorous and Fer-
ocious standing on the beach.
The two stood in silence for a moment,
staring about in wonder.
"I feel I must sit down", said Ferocious,
and did.
"This is really tremendous", said the
easy-going Jobrot, running his fingers
through the sand, and stretching in the sun.
"Better than your chilly old living-room,
isn't it?"
"It's not a question of that, dear boy",
complained Ferocious. "I object to being
whisked from the middle of my living-room
floor onto this nasty beach, without any con-
sultation whatsoever. Besides I never got a
chance to cancel the papers".
"Don't fuss so much", said Phosphorous,
"the adventure has started".
"So, dear lad, it would seem", said
Ferocious, unenthusiastically.
