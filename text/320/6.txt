FELIX FINANCIALLY
More than four out of every ten householders in this country own their own homes.
The time may come when you will want to join them. But how is it done? And what are
your chances? We talked to an expert to get some of the answers.
A roof over your head.
It's one of the basic pri-
orities. And finding a
roof you can call your
own is one of the major
pre - occupations o f
people who are begin-
ning to make their way
in life. It's something
you'll be worrying about
some day, perhaps. The
chances are that if and
when you reach the point
of buying your own
place, you'll be doing so
with the aid of a build-
ing society.
Well, what is a build-
ing society? What does
it do—and how? Leslie
Pask is the manager of
the Norwich branch of
the Nationwide Building
Society, one of the big-
gest in the country. He
agreed to stand in the
firing line while FELIX
FINANCIALLY shot the
questions.
First of all, what is a
building society?
PASK: It's an organ-
isation which l e n d s
money to people who
want to buy their own
homes. Owner-occupiers
represent about 45 to 50
per cent of householders
just now. But it'll prob-
ably be about 60 per
cent by the end of the
decade.
FF : is borrowing
money from a building
society the only way of
getting a house?
PASK: Well there's al-
ways the pools . . . but
for the chap who hasn't
got several thousand
pounds handy, the build-
ing society is the ideal
way to get the money.
Building societies handle
about 90 percent of
house purchase in this
country.
FF: How does one
qualify for a building
society loan?
PASK: If you're over
eighteen, you qualify.
That's the minimum age
for entering into that
kind of contract. But
naturally, that's not the
whole story. More im-
portant is that the build-
ing society has to be
satisfied you can repay
the loan.
FF: What yardstick
does a building society
use to make that judge-
ment?
PASK: In the normal
way, a building society
will not lend a sum ex-
ceeding three times the
applicant's annual in-
come. Or, put another
way, the monthly repay-
ments should not exceed
one week's income. Of
course, they are rough
\nd ready guidelines.
FF: So if, say, a grad-
uate starting his career
doesn't start by earning
a big salary, he's had it.
Right?
PASK: No, that's not
true. I personally would
always take into account
an applicant's future
prospects. If a young
man demonstrates his
foresight by wanting to
own his own property,
I'm prepared to make
allowances for the fact
that he may not, on the
face of it, have the
money. Most building
societies have schemes
which allow, for ex-
ample, repayment of in-
terest only in the first
years, without repay-
ment of capital. This
helps to keep a young
mans' outgoings in line
with an increasing in-
come.
FF: Supposing the
man is married. Would
you take a wife's income
into account?
PASK: Yes, in the
r i g h t circumstances.
We'd have to be satisfied
that both have reason-
able earning capacity.
After all, if we handed a
mortgage to a chap with
a low income and a wife
intent on having child-
ren, he'd soon be in a
hell of a mess, wouldn't
he? We wouldn't be
doing him any favours by
helping him put a mill-
stone around his neck,
would we?
FF: So you have to be
sure we've got the
money. OK, supposing
our applicant had a rea-
sonable job and good
prospects. How much
would you advance him
on the house he wanted?
PASK: Ninety percent,
in some cases, 95 per-
cent.
FF: And suppose he
had to borrow the money
for the other ten percent
from the bank. He'd be
paying that back, too.
You probably wouldn't
regard that very favour-
ably, would you?
PASK: You're right to
suggest that building
societies are cautious.
They have to be. Once
upon a time, they'd al-
ways insist on an appli-
cant putting down his
own money for a depo-
sit. It gave him a sub-
stantial stake in the
whole thing. But build-
ing societies are chang-
ing their thinking. For
one thing, the rising
value of houses means
that the moment the
owner crosses the
threshold, it's worth
more than he paid for it.
That way, he does have
a stake. That's why they
will consider people who
have borrowed every-
thing to get a house. As I
said earlier, the main
criterion is that the chap
who gets the mortgage
can afford to pay it back.
FF: And where do
building societies get the
money to lend?
PASK: F r o m two
sources. From the sav-
ings people invest with
us: and from the contin-
ual repayment of loans.
FF: It is difficult to get
a mortgage right now,
isn't it?
PASK: Yes. The de-
mand is outstripping the
supply. Building socie-
ties can only lend what
they have in the kitty.
Which makes it all the
more important for
young people to start
thinking about this now.
Regular saving — even
in small amounts —
with a building society
not only demonstrates a
sense of responsibility:
it also puts him, as an
investor, into a favoured
position when he wants
a mortgage.
FF: Alright. Our man
has done all you want.
He's got job prospects,
he's put a few pounds in
the building society, his
wife is on the pill. But
what about the actual
price of the house he
wants? Isn't it going to
be out of reach, any-
way?
PASK: Not neces-
sarily. Look, three years
ago, houses were cheap,
compared with other
commodities. In the past
three years, they've risen
fast, to about their econ-
omic level. They'll keep
rising, but only to keep
pace With living stand-
ards. I think the peak of
the house prices boom
has been passed.
FF: But it's not going
to be easy, is it?
PASK: It would be
dishonest to pretend it
is. But there are ways of
helping oneself. And the
most important is to
begin thinking about the
problem now. Start sav-
ing.
FF: But what if a
building society still re-
jects an application?
PASK: T h e n shop
around. Go to a dozen
building societies. They
all offer just about the
same facilities, but they
can be offered in differ-
ent ways by different
societies. Dig around.
Find a manager who
wants to understand
your problem.
FF: So you'd say there
is some hope for the
young chap who wants
to join the group and
buy his own home?
PASK: Age has little
to do with it. An intelli-
gent approach has every-
thing to do With it. Any-
one who wants to own a
house is being intelli-
gent. After all, it is prob-
ably cheaper than rent-
ing in the short run: and
it's the best way to finan-
cial security in the long
run. But whatever run
you have in mind—start
now.
Carnival
It's a pity that Jeff Beck
withdrew from this year's
Rag Carnival (it's not the
first time) because what it
needed badly was a name to
pull the crowds. Argent,
although a welt-known band
failed to do this. They play-
ed a fairly competent but
unoriginal set which never-
theless was well received.
Rod Argent is an accomplish-
ed organist and has talent
enough for more than twelve-
bars and commercial songs.
The bassist was solid and
moved about inciting the
audiience to dance. The rest
of the band didn't make any
impression. Russ Ballard's
guitar playing was insignifi-
cant and the drummer, al-
though introduced as one of
the best in the country was
only average. Their set clim-
axed in 'Hold Your Head
Up' which featured an excel-
lent organ solo and two
rockers, 'Sweet Mary' and
'Keep on Rollin'. By this
time the audience were
thoroughly enjoying them-
selves and brought the band
back for an encore.
Earlier the first band to
appear on stage were Biggies
whom I unfortunately missed.
Rainmaker, an acoustic duo
sounding a bit like America
then played a pleasant re-
laxing set in the J.C.R. They
were followed by the incred-
ibly bad Ellis in the Great
Hall. Steve Ellis and Zoot
Money proved that they
couldn't sing and Andy Gro-
beck, from Frankfurt, played
some lousy guitar while imi-
tating a fish. Zoot later him-
self admitted that they were
only "pissing about playing
second-rate pop and hoping
for a hit single." Steve had
two broken ribs which he ac-
quired in a fight in Germany
the previous week and had
taken two pain-killers before
the act.
After Ellis it was a relief
to listen to John and Bev-
erly Martyn. John featured
his now famous echo-guitar
effect. He achieves this amaz-
ing sound by fitting a pick-
up to his old battered guitar
and playing it through a
copy-cat unit and fender
reverb amp. After Argent
Mike Absolam presented us
with the amusing adventures
of Superintendent Maglagan.
This act for me was the best
of the evening. The audience
certainly enjoyed him too as
he was brought back for at
least three encores. It's a pity
there weren't more people
there.
The disco sounded great.
The Great
Chariot Race
(or Ben Hur has
nothing on us)
Quite a good turn-out on quite a nice day (though
numbers could easily be improved on if you realise
just what a small percentage of the USK students
about 200 is). Anyways, or maybe several ways,
there were enough to cause the usual panic in the
local piebs, as a bed on wheels, not to mention a
minesman on wheels and other equally grotesque
things on wheels sped down Oxford Street (sped
being the operative word).
No wonder the average gout ridden collector (too
many Mooney specials?) had a hard job collecting
sufficient donations if he/she/it had an even harder
one of keeping up with the main attractions. If they
hadn't have been going so fast, then many more
passers-by would have had the opportunity and the
time to put a coin in the box (coins were even
thrown at the entourage at one stage, whether in
an effort of benevolence or rage was hard to dis-
cern). Granted if the collectors had taken a more
leisurely pace then they could have spent more time
soliciting (?) but then the people around them may
have missed the entertainment.
Another sore point (especially for the poor girl
involved) was the overturning of a perilous mines
contraption which should not have been tried in the
first place as it was obviously unstable. The end
result was a fractured skull and a stay in hosiptal,
not a good advert for rag, especially as we were
collecting for crippled kids, and almost added
another to their number. So more care in future and
greater fun will be had for all.
To any interested sex-mechanics there were a lot
of spare birds around (Institute Francais vintage)
so a bit of harmonious tin rattling went on. It seems
also that they collected quite a sizeable amount
compared to Guilds measly £18 (plus six missing
cans), so being butch isn't everything.
Being Butch did count quite a Sot in the heats
around Speakers Corner, where one or two lads
come off at the corners and rolled around in the
grass, all good clean fun. The vehicles involved
were also quite gay, clothes racks, supermarket trol-
lies, prams . . . . even Guilds bed had flowers on it.
The whole lot then went under Marble Arch subway
down quite a long slope which prematurely aged a
bowler-hatted commuter walking the other way and
proceeded along Oxford Street. Three collecting
apes were in evidence and one collected an um-
brella laid over its back after scaring its aged owner.
At one point an enterprising policeman suggested
we travelled on the road, not the pavement, so
always glad to comply we moved onto the highway
going the wrong way down a one way street. After
this things went from worse to bad and the proces-
sion broke up with Mines and Guilds efforts sport-
ing back down Oxford Street (Mines won, but didn't
of course have the comfort of a Grand Touring
vehicle which the Guilds' bed offered).
Splinter groups (sounds nasty) moved off collect-
ing in varied directions, 'Clem' the Mines lorry
broke down, and everybody's hero the Felix reporter
left for home . . . .
