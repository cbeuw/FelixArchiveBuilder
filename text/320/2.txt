Black South Africans
People or Garbage?
asks ELIOT CHIAT
South Africa is a country with sunshine and beautiful
scenery, a country with wealth and rich resources. It is
also a country with a number of different racial groups,
and some people are in the awkward position of being
the wrong colour. The laws are so designed that these
people — the black members of the community —are
obliged to minister to the needs of the whites. In their
everyday lives they are restricted and degraded in every-
thing they do. They cannot come and go as and when
they wish, they cannot occupy themselves as they wish,
their families are frequently broken up, they are taxed
inequitably, their labour is bought at ridiculously low
rates, and their job tenure is totally unpredictable
Unfortunately for some,
they live in the wrong
place. How is this pos-
sible? It is the policy of
the white South African
government that people
with different coloured
skins shall live their lives
apart from each other, in
different places and in dif-
ferent ways according to
their different traditions.
However, the population
of the country is spread
out and mixed up in a re-
latively random fashion.
The policy Of separate de-
velopment dictates that
same areas are solely for
white development, some
for solely black people,
some for solely Indian
people, and so on. In the
case of the blacks, the
areas reserved for them are
known as the homelands.
Of course, not all black
people live in the home-
lands; on the contrary. Al-
most all the able-bodied
are employed in the indus-
try, the mines, the farms
and the homes of the white
community.
The black homelands
are made up of poor agri-
cultural land and are iso-
lated from urban areas.
Black people living outside
the homelands and not en-
gaged in serving the white
community will have to go
there, despite the fact that
they, and generations be-
fore them, have never been
there before in their lives.
Whole villages have to pull
up their roots, lose prac-
tically everything they
own which is not much
anyway, probably just
their homes and a few
cattle—to be transported
from the "black spots"
where they live to new
towns in the homelands.
Often they face years of
uncertainty as to the
future; usually they
are only given a few
days notice before their
removal. On the day, a
fleet of lorries arrives to
transport them. They are
taken away, to a place
which they do not know,
and dumped. They are
usually left in the middle
of nowhere, often as bar-
ren as a desert, at a place
where there are no houses;
they have to build their
own, although building
materials are seldom pro-
vided, and initially the
only accommodation is
tents; where there is no
food and hardly any
water—the nearest shop
may be miles away — and
the ground is usually too
poor to provide even a
subsistence economy in the
long term, let alone *he
short term; where there is
no industry to provide em-
ployment — so that the
men have to leave their
families and become mig-
grant labourers in order to
earn some money so that
they can pay the poll tax,
and to enable them to sur-(
vive. Where there are no
educational or medical
facilities, and even when
these do arrive, they are
completely inadequate;
where there are no sani-
tary facilities or power
supplies.
During the ten years
from 1959 to 1969, nearly
a million people were re-
settled in this way. Pro-
tests have been prevented
by intimidation, and
where they have emerged,
they have resulted in
arrests and prosecutions.
The land is overcrowded,
the population destitute
and starving. Incidence of
disease is extremely high,
as is the mortality rate.
What is more, the home-
lands are closed to those
people by whom the South
African Government does
not wish them to be seen.
Cosmas Desmond was a
priest at a mission serving
a %lack spot' in rural
Natal. In 1969 the popula-
tion of the village was re-
settled in the homelands.
Because of his awareness
of the conditions of Lime-
hill, where they were re-
settled. Father Desmond
made a journey—illegally
through the homelands to
find out what things were
like elsewhere. He pub-
lished his findings in a
book "The Discarded
People" (Penguin, 1971)
and he assisted in the pro-
duction of a film, "The
Dumping Grounds". "For
his attempts to assist Afri-
cans, he was refused a
passport to visit his family
in England. For his pains
in exposing the conditions
in the African homelands,
he was put under house
arrest. He is restricted to
his house for a large part
of each day; he is restric-
ted in his movements out-
side his house; he is res-
tricted in the number of
people he can talk to; and
he is prevented from com-
municating with some. His
movements are closely
watched by the police.
On Tuesday, 5th Dec-
ember, the film, "The
Dumping Grounds" will
be shown at Imperial Col-
lege. All members of the
college are urged to see it.
You may be shocked by
what you see, and you
ought to be, for it portrays
a situation which can
only be regarded with dis-
may and disbelief by any-
one who 'maintains decent
moral standards. In this
country the Anti-Apar-
theid Movement and a
host of liberation move-
ments representing black
people throughout the
southern part of Africa,
arefightingfor the rights
of these people and the
fight is being carried out
with guerilla tactics on the
ground of Southern
Africa; they are fighting
for the right to be able to
live a decent, normal life,
without fear, without hun-
ger, without being mis-
used and treated like ani-
mals, without being moved
around like garbage and—
most important—the right
of self-assertion. For many
years South Africa was a
possession of Britain, and
today our country helps to
maintain the regime
through its economic asso-
ciations. We must there-
fore bear a major respon-
sibility for the situation.
The example of Cosmas
Desmond should encour-
age everybody here to help
carry the struggle for the
introduction of justice
there to a successful con
elusion.

LSE BEATEN AGAIN
On Wednesday, 23rd November, City and Guilds
Rugby lst XV travelled to New Maiden to play LSE
lst XV away to eventually prove that there are now 27
people at I.C. who don't think they are the best college
side in London. The day was quiet cold with little wind
and the sun by 2.45 p.m. was quite low in the sky.
Guilds won the toss and elected to play down a slight
slope in the pitch with the sun shining into the opposi-
tions eyes.
The game started well and a good standard of rug-
by was produced with both sides struggling to gain
control of the play. Good searching attacks by Guilds
never let LSE settle down and with the forwards work-
ing well to provide a good deal of ball for the backs
it was clear that Guilds were a match for this sup-
posedly strong opposition team. Attacks by LSE were
not a real danger and the Guilds threequarters and
back row forwards were covering and tackling tremen-
dously well. Much of the play was in the opposition
half, and when thefirsthalffinishedit was clear Guilds
were in a strong position even though the score was
still 0-0.
The second half started with both teams knowing
that a big effort was to be made for at least 20 minutes.
The sun had by this time disappeared and enabled the
Guilds team to match their game to LSE's without a
disadvantage. Even though the opposition were attack-
ing strongly it was Guilds who made the first score
with a penalty kick by R. Hughes to put us 3-0 in the
lead.
Heartened by this score, the Guilds team pressed
more and more, harassing and attacking well, and
it was on such an attack that a loose ruck formed near
the opposition's try line. A break by M. Rickard from
the maul resulted in him scoring a well deserved try
about 10 yds out from the post. The conversion was
kicked by R. Hughes to make the score 9-0.
LSE by this time were a bit upset but they had not
given their best yet at all. In the next section of the
game the play was veryfiercewith heavy tackles and
rough mauling, which for the good of both sides the
ref brought to a quick end. The game was coming to
a close with LSE attacking strongly and Guilds defend-
ing well. However in the last few minutes, the opposi-
tion fly-half broke through our cover to score a try
which was converted to make the score 9-6 which was
the final score when the ref brought the game to a close
shortly afterwards.
Team : P. Dye, D. Osborne, N. Osborne, E. Mor-
gan, T. Bradbury, D. Shakesheff, R. Hughes, C. (work
it up) Wrigley, D. Robinson, T. Hollister, D. Lewis

APARTHEID is the big
issue at LEEDS this term.
For many weeks the
"Leeds Student" front
page has been taken up
with the pros and cons,
mainly the latter, of a
Barclay James Harvest
concert there on Saturday
week. The row was
caused because BJH had
made a recent tour of
South Africa and Rhod-
esia playing to segregated
audiences which, Leeds
Students said, implied
acceptance of the apar-
theid system. The Leeds
University Union exec
spent many happy weeks,
so it seems, arguing the
pros and cons of having
BJH play, and changing
their position weekly.
Eventually BJH did play
. . . to a very low audience.
The concert made an esti-
mated £700 loss.
Still at Leeds, Leeds
University Union made a
loss exceeding £7,500 last
year, Which would have
been bigger had the Union
not dug into its reserves.
The Union's Finance Com-
mittee have warned the
Union that this year's loss
will exceed £20,000 if they
do not cut back expendi-
ture drastically.
BRADFORD Univer-
sity Union has solved its
finance problem by telling
their Ents to make a
£1,000 profit this year.
Their Union Council fin-
ance meeting lasted from
6 p.m. at night to 8.45 the
following morning, and
they did not complete their
business.
"It seems that we are
all living a Utopian exist-
ence, although perhaps we
don't appreciate it", says
Palatinate, newspaper of
the Durham Colleges.
"We have received not a
grumble, not a quiet
moan, not even a hesitant
suggestion concerning life
in Durham. Such bliss —
can it be true?" We could
say the same about life in
South Ken . . .
We're not the only
unioni having elections this
week. At the New Univer-
sity of Ulster there are
dozens — including dep-
uty president, president of
the Athletics Union and
Chairman of Convocation.
Phase One, the Union
Newspaper, is no less than
50 per cent full of dection
details.
They are also very con-
cerned about vandalism at
NUU —• the University
Railway Halt (yes, it's
true!) was smashed up for
the third or fourth time
this year last week by in-
toxicated students.
Beware of SPERM
(Swansea People's Enter-
tainment Rescue Mission),
says Crefft. They're a new
organisation set up with
the aim of providing the
ents that students want, in*
stead of the concerts, etc.
run by the University Ents
Committee. They propose
to run "real dances" so
people get to meet each
other, and have got a
grant from the Union to
pursue their aims.
More inside news from
around Britain's student
newspapers next week.
