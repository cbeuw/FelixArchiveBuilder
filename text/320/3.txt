November 28, 1972 FELIX Page 3
The
Pres.
Dep.
on behalf
of Himself
(Mainly)
I refer to tbe front page of last FELIX, the article
concerning Council; such an original topic for FELIX
to take upon itself to discuss. (Why? Controversial is
our middle name — Ed.). It pointed out the shortcom-
ings of the three CCU Academic Affairs Officers, I
think it got one or two things confused. Miners have
different interests to Scientists who have different in-
terests to Engineers. It is almost inevitable that once
we get a President (perhaps "if") then Mike Doherty
will be presenting to Council some ideas on Academic
policy. (Mike has some ideas on the subject). Those
CCU AAO's will be able to give a valuable contribu-
tion, giving different and diverse views.
Of course, you might think that Council shouldn't
deal with this type of stuff. Who then? A n IC UGM?
Rather unwieldy. Or the proposed 20-member council?
Look, a 38 member council at least provides the POS-
SIBILITY for opinion from just about every facet of
the student opinion. (Except for the extreme apathist.
I'm sorry apathists, there's not much we can do for
you).
Of course, the article mentioned Floor Reps. It cor-
rectly says that they don't represent anyone by them-
selves. Tell me, when did anyone speak off-the-cuff on
some arbitrary topic and represent anyone but himself.
It's about time you learnt that "representative" means
"Delegation of responsibility without repercussions"
unless some specific mandate has been made. But you
know as well as I do that a floor rep isn't mandated,
so what are you getting at?
Finally, let me pose two guestions.
1. If the "bureaucratic decisions" were made by no-
one in particular, or some small body that could in no
way realistically reflect the opinions of 4,000 people at
IC, or even say the 2,000 participating Union members,
would you meekly accept them or question them?
i.e. Is it not better to know that some supposedly
reflective body, i.e. Council, has tried to make a valued
appraisal and decision, rather than have the result
foisted upon you?
2. Why, if the article is in favour of a mini council,
did Felix attempt last year, with the innovation of a
sabbatical editor to press for a place on Council for
the Editor (In fact, 1 told Joint Council in May that I
did NOT want a place on the Council; it was the idea
of the Editor at the time.—Ed).
The first question is for you to decide, but I think I
can partly answer the second.
Most places on council have come as a result of
pressure at IC UGM's from the people who hold the
view that Council could benefit from the ideas and
reflective attitudes of persons holding various posts.
The additions came as a result of IC UGM's voting on
these propositions. They did NOT come from Council.
Pause.
That's the end of my opinion, now on to some fact:
The Union
As you may have noticed if you've been across there
lately, things aren't yet ready. The RATT should be
opening in the near future. Watch this space for further
details. The Bar in the Union Lower Lounge is nearing
completion (I'm not so sure about solidarity with the
workers, but more in favour of good solid workers)
(Eta, ha . . . Ed). There will eventually be a Juke Box
in the Lounge. Please send me ideas for singles to

is Paul Jowitt, but don't tell Jimmy Young) IC UNION.
'1 want to see
the SRC change .
"I want to see the SRC change—change in quality,
change in what we do . . . "
So do I, having been to the emergency SRC (Students'
Representative Council) meeting on the Murray Report
held at the University of London Union last Monday.
The quote came from Tony Lake, without question the
most highly skilled student speaker in the University,
who told the meeting that that night was "the night we
lose our innocence".
"The end of the divorce of students with the authori-
ties begins tonight—we must become a federal union
and act federally", he said.
Love and kisses,
PAUL JOWITT
Ed's footnote: Next time, please Paul, read the article
before criticising it. I think, to quote you, "you got it
wrong". Our correspondent is wondering whether it's
really necessary to have the Dep Pres on Council . . . .
But what does "acting
federally" mean? Surely
not the farce I witnessed
on Monday, when six pre-
pared candidates were re-
turned unopposed onto
the Senate Working Party
on the Murray Report.
The first part of the
meeting was totally pre-
dictable. A motion on
Murray, proposed by the
Executive, was eventually
passed without dissent and
without abstention. The
motion welcomed the pro-
posals for the new Senate,
Court and Joint Planning
Committee, the offer of
student representation on
University bodies and the
strengthening of smaller
colleges, but lamented the
decision not to offer school
status to Goldsmiths'
College and noted the "un-
satisfactory position" over
the Privy Council policy
of 'reserved areas'.
The debate, which took
ninety minutes, consisted
in the main of forced
speeches on the motion,
which was generally ac-
ceptable to everyone pre-
sent.
The few bones of con-
tention were manifested
in several amendments,
tabled variously by St.
Mary's College, Charing
Cross Hospital Medical
School and the Chairman
of the SRC (Dave Em-
mett), all of which were
defeated.
But no amendments
were even tabled against
the final part of the
motion, which welcomed
the setting up of the Sen-
ate Working Party in-
cluding six students, and
resolved the SRC to elect
at that meeting, "a repre-
sentative and expert team
of students to co-ordinate
and communicate student
news on the Murray Re-
port to the University and,
within the SRC, between
college Unions".
So having passed the
motion, the SRC came to
the business of elections.
It rapidly transpired that
not only had the Execu-
tive drafted the motion,
but had also prepared six
candidates for the six
vacant posts on the Work-
ing Party. Stephen Moss,
External Affairs Vice-
President of King's Col-
lege, proposing the candi-
dates, said that there had
been no other nominations
. . . hardly surprising,
since negligibly few of the
assembled delegates had
known of these nomina-
tions (or indeed that there
A Personal
Viewpoint

Oliver
Dowson
were to be nominations at
all) prior to that after-
noon. To some delegates
the elections came as a
complete surprise. Other
nominations were not even
asked for until after Mr.
Moss had proposed the
Exec's choice, and plough-
ing confidently onward,
leaving the other delegates
speechless in its wake, the
Exec sewed up their elec-
tion with no trouble and
two abstentions in just a
few minutes.
Of the Six, some had
without doubt the re-
quired mixture of exper-
tise and representativity:
others selected were inev-
itable as ex-officio candid-
ates, and those remaining's
merits were dubious.
Tony Lake was the
SRC's representative on
the Murray Committee,
and with his long experi-
ence of the University and
powers of oration was a
natural choice. Jock Mc-
Ewan was the only mem-
ber of the Exec chosen
—he is the Secretary to the
SRC and a medical stud-
ent at Middlesex Hospital.
Joy Clancy, President of
ULU, and Dave Gilles,
Vice-President for Servi-
ces, are both on the team.
Steve Moss told the meet-
ing that Miss Clancy
"knows more about the
University than any of
us" and was a "very good
speaker" . . . well, she
certainly "knows what she
wants" anyway. Dave
Gilles, who came to the
meeting as a representa-
tive of the INstitute of
Education, was however
elected to the working
party on an NUS platform
—"he has the whole na-
tion of students to think
of", said Mr. Moss. Dave
McVitty, although not
present at the meeting,
was also elected: he is the
President of Goldsmiths'
College, and, the meeting
was told, "has the inter-
ests of small colleges at
heart". Paul Goddard,
President of Chelsea Col-
lege "stands up on his own
merits" according to Mr.
Moss, although he did not
elaborate further than sug-
gesting him to be a good
speaker.
Keith Baker, Vioe-
Chairman of the SRC, told
me that these were not the
only people approached:
several others they asked
were either unavailable or
unsuitable.
In an LSPA interview
with Mary Dunne of
Kings' News, Dave Em-
mett, the Chairman, said
that he considered the
elections quite fair — he
or another member of the
Executive had telephoned
most delegates present at
the meeting during the
day and informed them of
the candidates and election
procedure. Few, he said,
had expressed any doubts.
He correctly stated that
an opportunity for other
nominations had been
given.
But what sort of an
opportunity? There's not
much any delegate can do
when he is told what is
happening by telephone at
three o'clock in the after-
noon with the meeting
starting at 7.30. Stuck at
their own colleges, with
four-and-a-half hours to
the meeting, there was
little choice for delegates
but to sit back and let it
all happen.
Oh, I was forgetting.
After the Exec's candid-
ates had been proposed,
Mr. Ernmett offered to
take other nominations —
but since, in the five-
second pause that fol-
lowed, no-one shot up and
said anything, nominations
were closed.
Although it may be ad-
mitted that democracy
does sometimes tend to be
a hindrance, it would be
nice if the SRC could at
least give a semblance of
it now and again. They
might at least have put up,
say, ten candidates for the
six places so there would
have been a choice.
Unless we get our own
politics working fairly,
how on earth can we com-
plain about Governments
and other bodies working
on a national scale.
