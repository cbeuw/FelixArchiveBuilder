Sports Merger To Go Ahead In July '94
B Y J O E M C F A D D E N
The two largest student sporting
bodies in Britain are to merge in
July 1994, creating a centralised
sports administration.
The new organisation will be
called the British University Sports
Association ( B U S A ) and will
replace the University Athletics
Union (UAU) and the British Uni-
versity Sporting Federation (BUSF).
Imperial College (IC) and St
Mary's are both members of U A U ,
which handles team sports at the
inter-university level in England,
but not of BUSF, which organises
regional events throughout Britain.
IC students competing at this level
would represent the University of
London Union (ULU), which is a
member of BUSF, rather than IC
itself. Because the new organisation
w i l l take its constitution from
BUSF, London colleges have had
no individual say in the merger
decision; only U L U could vote.
Charles Leary, Imperial College
Union's (ICU) Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies), feels that one
vote will not be enough for the
70,000 London students and 37
institutions. "I am unhappy that
most of the decision making
process went on in a meeting we
had no vote in," he said.
Mr Leary explains that although
St Mary's and IC would continue to
enter separate teams, ICU will pay
the total subscription to B U S A ,
invoicing St Mary's afterwards.
Subscription fees depend on the
Prince's Trust Donation To Nightline
Kate Barlow accepting a chequefrom The Prince's Trust
B Y L Y N N B R A V E Y

University of London Union's
(ULU) Nightline has become the
first student body ever to receive a
grant from the Prince's Trust.
The cheque, made out to the
value of Â£850, was presented at the
Prince's Trust headquarters to Kate
Barlow, officer in charge of Night-
line, by Tom Shebbeare, Director
of the Prince's Trust headquarters.
Barlow said that the money given
would go towards training costs for
volunteers, who have to spend a
weekend away. She went on to say:
"Nightline is very happy to receive
the grant, this being the first time
the trust has recognised students as
a 'needy' group. The Trust's aims
are to provide money for young
people to help other young people.
They stressed that they will not be
able to consider individual students
for such grants."
The recognition by the Prince's
Trust for the need of Nightline's
services should help in the attempt
to secure Government money for
the scheme. Although John Patten
assured students that 'student union
reforms should not affect welfare
services', Nightline could suffer
from a possible defederalisation of
the University of London as
colleges currently support the
scheme. This may not be the case
following a split.
Nightline was originally set up
in 1971 at Imperial College follow-
ing four suicides in one year at the
College. It moved to U L U five
years ago and now provides a
service to all students in London. It
runs throughout the night and
doesn't just deal with emotional
problems; it has information on
everything going on in London.
Guilds Treasurer Resigns
B Y M A R K S I M M O N S
Dr Paul Ewing, Honorary Senior
Treasurer of City and Guilds
College Union ( C & G C U ) ,
announced his resignation this
week. Dr Ewing, a lecturer in the
Department of Mechanical Engin-
eering, has been involved in the
C & G C U for over a decade.
In a letter to Paul Griffith,
C & G C U President, Dr Ewing
wrote, T feel strongly about staff
involvement in student affairs, but I
do not want to carry on with the
way things are being controlled by
Imperial College Union - I am
really just a cheque signing
machine. It's time to go'.
Imperial College Union (ICU)
originally assumed the management
of the finances of the Constituent
College Unions' (CCUs') to reduce
administrative costs, but M r
Griffith feels that this is becoming
'a level of bureaucracy you would
not expect of a student union'.
In an interview on Imperial
College Radio, M r Griffith said,
"It's been building up over a
number of years. We're finding that
more and more of our say over
what we do with our money is
becoming less and less ours."
Speaking about the resignation,
M r Griffith told Paul Dias, IC
Radio News Editor, that Dr Ewing
is finding he is prevented from
making basic decisions on where
money should be going. "He feels
that his job has been eroded as a
result of the relationship between
ICU and [C&GCU]."
In his letter, Dr Ewing wished
the C & G C U every success in the
future, saying, T have enjoyed my
years as Senior Treasurer. Thank
you all'.
size of the institution, but a flat rate
will be introduced as part of the
merger, lowering the cost to ICU.
St Mary's will be represented in
BUSA by ICU, despite the fact that
St Mary's has always been treated
as a separate entity from Imperial.
Greg Jones, U A U Chairman,
said that separate votes for IC and
St Mary's is an area that we need to
address, a sentiment echoed by Mr
Leary, who stressed the importance
of clearing up misunderstandings
before the merger takes effect.
Freddie!
B Y M I C H A E L I N G R A M
A statue in honour of rock star
Freddie Mercury could be erected
in Beit Quad, if plans by 'Queen
Productions' go ahead.
The company handles the affairs
of Queen, the group fronted by
Freddie until his death from AIDS
in 1991. It has made an informal
application to Imperial College for
permission to build the memorial
on College land.
The site was chosen last year
after being surveyed by Jacky Gunn
from Queen Productions. The
company had previously been
refused permission to build a
commemoration at Freddie's home
in Kensington. The surviving
members of the band are 'very
enthusiastic' about placing the
tribute in what is 'the birthplace of
Queen'.
Guitarist Brian May formed the
band whilst studying at Imperial
College. The first live show
(without Freddie Mercury) was
played in the Union Building.
Irene Drexler, a native of
Hungary now in London, has been
commissioned to sculpt the statue.
She has been given a 'free reign'
over what the tribute will depict. A
wealth of research material
(including videos and other
paraphernalia) has been provided.
The request has, as yet, not been
approved by Ian Caldwell, the new
college Estates Manager, who
entered the job at the end of last
month. A n official response may
not be possible until after the next
Management Planning Group
meeting on 13th December.
Mercury died at his home two
years ago this week, aged 45. The
cost of the statue will come from
his estate.
