Expansion Plans for Medical Faculty
BY PAUL DIAS AND MARK SIMMONS
Imperial College could become a
medical 'super-school' within two
years.
Sir Ronald Oxburgh, Rector of
Imperial College (IC), has made
clear the prospect of further
expansion of Imperial's medical
faculty through the merger of
Imperial College with Charing
Cross and Westminster Medical
School (CXWMS).
This move follows the
recommendations in last year's
Tomlinson Report on provision of
health care in London. The report
also suggested IC merge with three
postgraduate medical schools, the
National Heart and Lung Institute,
the Institute of Cancer Research
and the Royal Postgraduate
Medical School as part of an
amalgamation of all the current
London medical schools into four
main faculties. The merger would
mean Imperial would play a
significantly greater role in British
medical teaching and research.
Imperial and C X W M S were
asked by the Higher Education
Funding Council for England
(HEFCE) to present joint proposals
for the merger in the light of the
suggested health care reforms.
The Rector, writing in the
November Issue of Network, the IC
staff journal, concluded that the
biomedical field is one that is likely
to offer enormous research
potential for the future. In his
opinion the College cannot afford
to miss this opportunity to expand.
The College's reply to the
H E F C E , entitled 'Strategy for
Medicine', describes in detail how
the proposed merger would be
implemented and how it would
affect IC. The fundamental structural
change would be the establishment
of an expanded 'College of
Medicine' comprising both graduate
and undergraduate schools. Such a
college would encompass all depart-
ments and institutes concerned with
clinical and NHS-related activities.
Substantial building work would
be required on the South
Kensington campus for under-
graduate teaching facilities. The
cost of the new biomedical
buildings and associated libraries
and lecture theatres is currently
estimated at £67 million.
The merger would benefit
C X W M S , currently experiencing
potentially serious budgetary
problems, but could result in the
closure of its present facilities.
The earliest date for any merger
would be August 1995.
Student Grants Cut
BY MICHAEL INGRAM
Student debts are set to increase
next year as the Government cuts
the basic grant by ten per cent. The
reduction was announced by the
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke in his
first budget on Wednesday.
The reduction in the main rates
of grant w i l l be offset by an
increase in the maximum level of
loan. This will result in an effective
rise in possible student income of
four per cent. The loan repayment
system will not be affected. Similar
adjustments will be made over the
next two years.
The Government intends to
make contributions to student
income from grants and loans equal
over the next few years. According
to the Chancellor, the parental
contribution toward student
maintenance will be reduced.
The changes have met fierce
opposition from various quarters.
Lorna Fitzsimons, President of the
National Union of Students (NUS)
said, "the government must realise
that students cannot take any more
debt". A spokesman for the NUS
stated that 'we support a grant
index-linked to the 1979 level'. The
grant level was frozen several years
ago, effectively reducing its value
annually. Vice-Chancellors accused
the Government of 'denying
opportunities to well-qualified
students'.
Speaking on IC Radio, Keith
Bradley M P , Labour Shadow
Social Security minister said: "This
new cut in the grant will undermine
[students'] confidence in entering
higher education."
