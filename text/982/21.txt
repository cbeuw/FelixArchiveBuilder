I was talking to my dad earlier in the week. He
told me that he was having problems with the
hard drita on his computer, which meant that he
was unable to access any files. This got me
thinking about the fact that none of the Felix
computers (and we have three) have been
backed up since we got them.
After this conversation, I said to Rose (who
works in the office) that we really ought to back
up the machines and that I'd do it over the
weekend. The machines have been known to
crash every now and again, but nothing really
major, we'd just lose the odd hour or two's
work. So I guess we'd never had a readon to
think too seriously about it before. I know, I
know, it's the one thing you should always do -
save everything reguarly, just in case! But
anyway, I was all set to sort it out this weekend.
Do you believe in fate? Is everything going
to happen, no matter what you do? I'm a great
one for telling everyone else not to tempt fate.
So why don't I listen to my own advice for a
change? I should have kept my big mouth shut!
Yep, you guessed, the machines crashed big
time. Not just your usual little system error or
anything like that. No, instead we get a major
hard drive failure. And this was at about 5pm on
a Thursday afternoon, one of the busiest and

most stressful times. This particular week, we
still had a fair bit of work to do on the issue and
every bit of text needed was stored on that
machine.
I'm not particularly computer literate at the
best of times. I know how to get out of some
situations (which usually involves pressing the
'reset' button!) but a serious fault on the hard
drive worried me slightly. So, I thought I'd ask
one of the DoC folk who frequent the office.
It was then that I found that fate had dealt
another cruel blow - all the computer geniuses
who hang around the office were either ill in bed
with 'flu or were out at some computer show for
the afternoon. Could it possibly get any worse, I
asked myself?
But all was not lost. IC Radio is known to
have one or two computing-type persons lurking
in their vicinity. So I gave them a ring and spoke
to Steve. His reply was "Shit! I'm on my way."
This didn't sound good. But I needn't have
worried. Steve sorted it all out in about ten
minutes - what a hero!
I'm just keeping my fingers crossed (I'm not
all that superstitious, honest) that nothing else
goes wrong before you all get your mitts on this
issue.

Election Congratulations
Dear Beccy,
I would like to congratulate Steve Hoborough
on his victory in the City and Guilds Vice
Presidential elections. Undoubtably his
experience will prove invaluable in performing
his function. I wish Steve all the best for his
term of office and I shall be happy to provide
any assistance possible.
Finally I would like to thank those
enlightened people who took the trouble to vote
for me. I'm sorry to disappoint you but the
golden age will come. And remember I am still
the sultan of Brunei aswell as a non-executive
director of Shell.
Yours,
Benjamin Maxwell
