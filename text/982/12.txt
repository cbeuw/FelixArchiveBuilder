But as to those who
Rejected Allah, (to them will be said):
"Were not Our Signs rehearsed to you?
But ye were arrogant
And were a people given to sin!
"And when it was said
That the promise of Allah
Was true, and that the Hour-
There was no doubt about its (coming),ye
Used to say,' We know not what is
The Hour: we only think
It is an idea, and we
Have no firm assurance.'"
Then will appear to them
The evil (fruits) of what
They did, and they will be
Completely encircled by that
Which they used to mock at!
It will also be said:
"This Day We will forget
You as ye forgot
The meeting of this Day
Of yours! And your
Abode is the Fire, and
No helpers have ye!
