A Questionnaire Of Sport
This questionnaire is geared towards all users of Imperial College's sports facilities,
whether they be competitive or recreational. There will be a sports strategy laid
down in the next year and the results of this survey will form the base for that
strategy. Whether you compete on a sports team or just kick a ball around with
some friends please fill out this questionnaire.
As an incentive, we can offer a range of prizes including a months pass to any one
activity in the Sports Centre, T-shirts and Sweatshirts. The deadline for the prize
draw is 31st December 1993. The winners will be announced in the 10th January
edition of Felix.
