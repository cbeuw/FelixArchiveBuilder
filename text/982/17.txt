Teenage Fanclub and the Juliana Hatfield Three
Cambridge Corn Exchange
She comes in happy, the quintessential college
girl; Evan Dando's overshadowed Siamese twin,
if you believe all we write. From last year's solo
outing comes an all new lineup. If you carefully
observe, there are three people on stage and only
one has the initials JH. They start playing and
it's obvious that we'll have to work for our
atmosphere tonight. Juliana's stage presence is
not huge, she's pretty static and the rest of the
trio don't add anything. Just let the music talk.
The usual instrumental surface of every indie
band from the Corn Exchange to Ulan Bator is
being embraced on stage. Only what has been
labelled as "girlie squeaky vocals" propel us to
something higher. Maybe the phrase could be
softened but, as a description we can relate to,
it's spot on. The whole vocal package is strung
in a way that you don't get from any testos-
teroned perspective. The swooping drawn out
joy at the end of a chorus or the scraping rhymes
and undulations become alive and treasured.
You don't need the Riot Grrrls to have feminine
music, you only need a woman.
The songs are mainly from 'Become What
You Are', latent with self fulfiling improvement
and only the piquant 'Everybody Loves Me But
Y o u ' pokes through from a solo past. For
someone of her poster lauded dimensions it's a
strange title but that's the path she travels. A
world underpinned with melancholy and
introversion. We never gain what we think we
want and even when we do it flees away. That's
what gives the gig a poignancy, because it's not
good and yet is an honest statement. I will her to
be good and the fact that she isn't reflects more
on me and my perceptions.
"Are you cold out there?" Someone in the
crowd tries to reply. In fact he tries several times
but Juliana can't hear and a light embarrassment
falls. This is real voyeurism because it's the
heart of her personality standing there in a
spotlight of dysfunction. The end of the set, as
on the album, is T Got No Idols', a song against
the groupies we long to be. Another self-
depriving statement which asks us to be honest
and that's what live music is all about, leaving
some of your soul in the mind of the audience.
Teenage Fanclub are the mirror reverse of
what's gone before. They can hold the stage in
the palm of their plectrum and yet they're not
aiming as high as self analysis; that they're alive
is enough. When things go wrong with the
sparkie plugs and sockets the show stays on in
that happy way. Norman smiles and leads and
you know this is as enjoyable for him as it is for
us and probably more. The first half is excel-
lently solid. The hard graft of supertrivial guitars
in overdrive. Don't knock them but don't expect
either. As benefits their status as the lovelies
leading the 'rip off brigade there are covers;
Dylan's 'Tamborine Man' and something from
Gram Parsons, but not a note sounds like their
supposed stylised mold Big Star, of course.
The second half does limp though. The
provincial teenagers down the front are losing
their jumping shoes. A cut of twenty minutes
would have created a rounded beast of vintage
but we are given something which ends up a
little deformed. Give due where it lives though
they end with the traditional and similarly
majestic 'Everything Flows' which even two
members of the Posies can't detract from. A
song from their first album gives old life to the
dogs, a reminder that development can atrophise.
