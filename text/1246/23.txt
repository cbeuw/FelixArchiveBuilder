Hey Kids! I'm back, to serve up an even more delicious dish of
delights to tickle the tastebuds of your intellectual tongue
(metaphorically speaking of course). Despite last week's 17 Down
being an absolutely atrocious clue, for which I apologise profusely
and a couple of queries about whether focussing can be spelt with
only one's' (it can - I looked it up!) some of you still managed to
complete the entire thing and hand it in to the Felix office, or e-
mail coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk. This week's lucky winner is Neil Yorke-
Smith, IC-PARC.
I've decided to start a new feature to help out those of you who I've
seen staring at cryptic crosswords in disbelief without any idea
how to begin. The first cryptically devious technique I've decided
to focus on is the included word. You can usually spot these by the
use of words like 'contains' or 'holds' in the clue. As an example,
the clue:
Hugo attains greatness holding Boris (4)
Would give the answer 'goat'. Until next time, dear friends...
