One Love Warchild Covers Album
2/5
This is the second covers album
to be released by the War Child
charity with NME. The first time
round the songs covered were not
necessarily big hits and the acts
on the record were more con-
sciously 'cool' than commercial.
As a result the profits were obvi-
ously not that great, as this time,
all the tracks are No.l singles
from the past fifty years, and your
dad will have heard of almost all
the artists.
Ms Dynamite lays sweet,
mature vocals over a straightfor-
ward cover of Soul 2 Soul's
However Do You Want Me.
Feeder and the Stereophonies
come up with emotionally
wrought versions of The Power Of
Love and Nothing Compares 2 U
respectively. Kelly Jones does his
predictable 'I'm very emotional'
thing and Grant Nicholas, less
predictably, pulls off the same.
My least favorite tracks are
Prodigy being The Specials and
Jimmy Eat World being Prodigy.
Both Ghost Town and Firestarter
were relevant at the time of their
release in a political way and
removing that context leaves the
covers as strings of lyrics.
The standouts are Badly Drawn
Boy with Come On Eileen which
is genius in part because of
Jool's Holland's participation and
in part because of Damon
Gough's talent for sounding pes-
simistic and optimistic all at
once. Also, it is revealed that
Gary Barlow could quite possibly
have been thinking of David
McAlmont when he was writing
Back For Good, so perfectly do
Bernard Butler's partners soulful
tones suit the track. (Maybe Gaz
should make a comeback as
Bernie's co-writer.)
On the covers front, I feel the
way to go is faster and louder,
with more drums and shouting if
possible. This record mostly goes
the other way, as it's for charity,
so suffers as a result.

AMERICAN I
BEAUTY
"At the third stroke, it will be
eleven fifty eight and ten sec-
onds". So begins the new album
from "record collector/fanatic,
master of disguise, disco
mechanic and top notch produc-
er and remixer" (not my words)
Dave Lee AKA Jakatta. You
know, the one who did that
American Beauty song. The one
with the glockenspiel and the
breathy la-la-la-la-la-na-na-na.
Oh come on, its been on just
about every dance compilation
from here to eternity for the last
year. And so herein lies the prob-
lem, music like this is just too
forgettable, too generic. The
sleeve notes make a point of how
much Dave loves the cinema and
how much this album is just
waiting to be commissioned for
the new Sam Mendes film. Don't
be fooled by the singles, it does
indeed sound like a film sound-
track. A film about beaches and
clouds and gently swooping birds
and palm trees swaying in the
cool sea breeze while the tide
softly laps up onto the golden
shore as a silhouetted man in a
trenchcoat walks slowly towards
a battered shack. It is essentially,
a perfect ambient chill-out
album, and while it may be tech-
nically accomplished and very
well arranged it just sounds the
same as itself and the other half
million chill out albums avail-
able. The aforementioned first
track It Will Be has the standard
issue, looping spaced out electro-
piano layered with some light
jazz drumming, but then over the
top there's some bizarre bleeping
arrangement that sounds like
Tinky Winky trying to play the X-
Files hook on a Casio keyboard.
The final track Strung Out is
indeed very strung out and could
do with being about five minutes
shorter, although with this being
chill-out we don't want to rush
things too much do we?
Everything in between follows
pretty much the same pattern of:
gentle piano intra followed by
soft drum loop followed by float-
ing in space noises (possibly with
some wispy female vocal) fol-
lowed by some more piano/wood-
wind and maybe even some ran-
dom electronic noises, eventually
going to artistic fade into the next
track. Despite all this, it does
what it does very well indeed.
Stick it on after a hard day at the
office, collapse into an oversized
armchair or a hot bubble bath,
close your eyes and let the lush
production and atmosphere take
you to a place infinitely more
relaxed and serene.

Coldplay - The Scientist
Proving that they still know
how to pen a damn fine rock
ballad, Coldplay's new single is
a poignant tale of enduring
love. The second to be taken
from the band's ace new
album, A Rush Of Blood To The
Head, this starts with a simple
piano refrain and Martin's ten-
der vocals, before building
steadily with subtle orchestra-
tion and haunting harmonies
towards a rousing finale that'll
have you waving your lighter in
the air. "Nobody said it was
easy", Martin claims, but with
songs these good, Coldplay
make success seem effortless.
5/5 Tom Bell
The Coral - Dreaming of You
If you are a fan, you will find 2
new tracks on the single:
Answer Me which contrasts
with the happiness of
Dreaming of You. The tempo is
slow, the voice is grave. Follow
the Sun belongs to another
genre - it sounds like the
garage rock of The White
Stripes, full of guitar and heavy
drums. The Coral show an
amazing diversity of style for a
new band. If you haven't got
the album yet, you can try the
single. Dreaming of You - one
of the best songs of the album,
to give you a good idea of The
Coral sound: a joyful experi-
ence without restraint!
4/5
Luna - Lovedust
Mike
Pleasant and sentimental cho-
rus-verse guitar pop.
Competent musicianship yet
unimpressive lyrics. Lovedust
is catchy but disposable.
Unsophisticated but could stir
the heart in conjunction with
mild intoxication
