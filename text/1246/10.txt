Welcome to Felix's first ever fash-
ion page!
This section is not here to tell
you what to wear, but what's in,
what's not and where to buy it on
a student budget.
My fellow fashion editor and I
are not fashion experts, but we
enjoy shopping and reading fash-
ion magazines.
In the future we are looking for
articles help to fill this page; par-
ticularly male fashion writers
because our knowledge of male
fashion is fairly limited. Articles on
shops, trends, in fact anything to
do with style are welcome.
This week's article is on where
to shop in London, for freshers
who aren't familiar with our capital
city and for older students who
haven't discovered all the great
places yet. This isn't a full guide
just the places we know well and
think are worth a visit.
Oxford Street
The fashion mecca of London, if it
isn't here you aren't gonna find it.
Well that isn't strictly true, but as
far as high street shops are con-
cerned they are all here usually in
multiples!
Places worth visiting:
Topshop/Topman: This shop is in
Oxford Circus right by the exits to
the tube station. It is absolutely
huge and you can quite easily get
completely lost in it.
Topshop is on the lower two
floors, with the widest range of
accessories you have ever seen on
the ground floor. The basement
has all the clothes and will keep
you busy for hours!
Topman is on the first floor and
has a good range of menswear. It
is particularly good for going out
clothes, though please not Ben
Sherman shirts!
Tips for this shop: Take your
High Street Kensington - perfect for lunch time shopping
time! There is so much it is a good
idea going with an idea of what
you want before you get there, just
browsing will take hours.
Mango: For girls only this is a rel-
atively new store. It's very good
and very reasonable. Fantastic for
cute little going out tops and up to
the minute fashion items.
Selfridges: Well I couldn't mention
Oxford Street and not talk about
this store. It is up towards Marble
Arch and is normally full of
tourists.
It has all the latest designer
labels and a few celebs walking
around. The food department is
also fantastic and if you feel
cheeky it is possible to get tasters
of everything!
HMV: There are a couple of these
along Oxford Street and have a
great selection CDs and DVDs to
top up your collection.
Oxford Street takes time and
patience with plenty of coffee
breaks. There are many coffee
shops on side streets or my per-
sonal favourite is in Marks and
Spencers, which always quiet and
they do a yummy hot chocolate!
Saturdays are mad, never do
Oxford Street towards Christmas
unless you are a rugby player
because it is impossible. Also
avoid it in the rain because the
pavements turn into mini lakes
and slow the flow of human traffic
down even more.
