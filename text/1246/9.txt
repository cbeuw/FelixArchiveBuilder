Balls In Barbados
home with a toilet roll holder and
the surrounding piece of wall she
had taken it from.
Saturday 29th June: After only
2 hours sleep, the first memory of
the day is sleeping in the hotel car
park. We had crawled out of bed
with probably the worst hangovers
of the fortnight to get a taxi into
town, making our last effort for the
Bajan Unifest Tour - a Jolly Roger
Cruise. There was no drinking by
us, even though it was free. There
was no snorkelling, even though it
was free. There was no moving.
Jess slept in the shade of the
lower deck for the entire 4-hour
journey, and lost a flip-flop over-
board. Somehow it just didn't
matter. Clare lost 2 t-shirts over-
board. Some made it onto the
rope swing, some made it to
dance on the deck.
Most didn't.
Sunday 30th June: The whole
day was devoted to rest and recu-
peration. The IC Rugby team
arrived on Friday and this after-
noon we went to watch their 1st
game of the tour. They won, easi-
ly. We followed a lazy day with a
girls night in, with pizza and a
film.
2nd week: The days were spent
playing netball, cricket and
rounders, followed by many great
nights out with the IC rugby lads.
Dancing, drinking, sand fights,
beer fights, it could have almost
been the union (I am, of course,
lying). Whilst the St. Mary's girls
taught us new drinking songs, the
boys taught us a few new drinking
games ('Fives' becoming a firm
favourite). A tropical storm kicked
in on Tuesday and in true Brit
fashion, we headed to the beach
to play rounders. In a last minute
panic about lack of cultural knowl-
edge of Barbados, we went to
Bridgetown, the island's capital.
In a cultural overdose, we invest-
ed in matching Hawaiian shirts,
so we would look really classy
when we went out. We also went
on a coach tour of the island.
Barbados is 11 by 14 miles (I
know lots of interesting facts like
this now), so getting anywhere is
very quick. We saw Harrison's
Cave, the 8th wonder of the world
according to our guide. To be hon-
est, it could have been Devon. We
also went to the Flower Forest, a
plantation, and got very excited
about seeing real monkeys. The
walk took us only 30 minutes as
the lure of a cafe at the end of it
was too great. The IC Netball and
Rugby squads invaded Sherry's
home on Friday afternoon for a
fantastic barbecue. We played a
friendly netball match against the
Cheltenham and Gloucester
(hockey) team - we won - with the
rugby team as our back-up. The
end of tour meal was our last
chance to dress up and wear the
heels we had packed but not worn
for 2 weeks. Awards were won,
wine was drunk. Harbour Lights,
stilt-men, rugby boys and rum
punch beckoned.
"I'm really glad I joined the net-
ball club," said Ragga Queen
Clare during a night at Harbour
Lights. That's what it's all about.

Who Hosts, Wins
It is hard to see why the appropri-
ate entities are not pushing harder
to make Great Britain a true con-
tender for future Olympic bids. For,
throughout this great summer of
sport, one theme has consistently
surfaced. Almost without exception,
the host nation has performed
above all expectations. This holds
true across a wide range of sports
and from the very beginning of the
summer at the World Cup right
through to last September's
delights at the Belfry. There is no
question that a nation performing
well is a happy nation, both eco-
nomically and socially, and the way
to ensure success seems to be to
engineer the presence of a fervent
home support.
Curtis Strange said it himself in
the build-up to the 34th Ryder Cup
- "I expect Sam (Torrance) to enlist
the help of a thirteenth man - the
crowd." Said supporters did them-
selves proud, buoying the European
players along on a tide of emotion,
passion and desire. However, they
did not forget that they were a golf-
ing crowd, and generously applaud-
ed the American players as well.
Thus, the event was the friendliest
for some years, but there was no
doubting that the Europeans would
dig that little bit deeper, such was
the abundance of flags of every
European nation involved. There
were even some sightings of the EU
flag, indicating a newfound togeth-
erness that could only benefit the
team. We all know the end result:
Colin charged from the front, the
leaderboard began to turn a lovely
shade of blue, Paul McGinley tidied
things up, Sam cried and Sunday
lunches were punctuated with cries
of joy.
Turn the clock back a couple of
months and we find ourselves in
Manchester, in the midst of
England's most successful
Commonwealth Games ever. The
other Home Nations performed well
but it was England who shone,
almost as brightly as David
Beckham's glorified shell suit at the
opening ceremony. Never before
had three flags of St George flown
high in the swimming pool, but in
Manchester it happened twice in
the same evening. Even more
unheard of, as swimming took cen-
tre stage, the Australian women's
relay team was beaten by the girls
from England. Twice. On the run-
ning track, Paula Radcliffe's second
step towards the completion of an
astonishing hat trick (London
Marathon, Commonwealth
5,000m, and European 10,000m)
was typical of the spirit of the
English team throughout the
Games. Through the pouring rain,
this skinny lass with knee socks
was cheered from start to finish as
she demolished the opposition. The
women's hockey team surpassed all
expectations by reaching the final,
only losing to India at the very
death. All over Manchester, athletes
young and old were inspired by the
enthusiastic crowd. All over the
nation, viewers were inspired by the
enthusiastic athletes. A report has
just been issued stating that the
Games were a success financially. It
was sport at its best, prosperous
from all angles.
Back at the beginning of the
summer the football funfair that is
the World Cup visited Asia for the
first time. It was also the first time
that two countries had shared the
honour of hosting the tournament.
Yet again, both host nations easily
transcended even the most opti-
mistic hopes. Who can forget the
excitement generated by Inamoto,
then an unknown Japanese in the
Highbury shadows, currently star-
ring for Fulham. Then there was
South Korea, who no-body, but no-
body could have expected to reach
the dizzying heights of the semi-
finals. The level of support for this
country was verging on the alarm-
ing and the nation must have added
a packet to its GDP through replica
shirt sales alone. With this sort of
crowd co-ordination, this was one
place where one could almost
expect a testing of the theory that, if
all the crowd exhaled together, they
could blow the ball into the appro-
priate net. With the parties going on
long into the night and the legacy of
a dozen stadiums of superb quality,
not many would question the bene-
fits of hosting this competition.
Yet still the politicians faff around
with no plans in the near future to
bring any of the world's major
sporting events to Great Britain. Not
the Olympic Games, not the World
Athletics Championships, not the
World Cup. With even a national
stadium beyond our capabilities,
there seems little hope that this will
change in the near future. We can-
not underestimate what we are
missing out on.
