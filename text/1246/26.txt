eight goal thriller
IC VI 4 - 4 IC V
It should first be noted that this
is by far and away the most
important fixture of the season
for both teams, and there was
pride as well as points at stake.
The sixths had won all their
previous games and had beaten
the fifths in their last encounter
started the match as favourites.
But this was a fierce local derby,
and both teams knew that the
formbook could be thrown out
the window.
The sixths took the lead
through Richard Jones after a
particularly scrappy opening
period, even by our standards,
before John Scott levelled fol-
lowing a corner.
The game became more
stretched as both sides began to
believe it would be much better
to win, rather than simply to not
lose. The fluidity and pace of the
sixth's play was truly superb, as
Sugi and Rich combined magnif-
icently to set Luis up, who cool-
ly rounded the keeper to give the
sixths a well deserved lead. The
next twist in the tail came just
on the very stroke of half time,
when in the absence of a lines-
man the fifths equalised.
The game was already partic-
ularly heated, and this incident
really threatened to push it
towards a melt down of truly
epic proportions.
The second half began at a
frenetic pace, which suited each
teams wide players, and gave
both sets of full backs plenty of
work to do.
This pressure finally told when
Rich was violently pushed in the
back following a long throw and
a penalty was rightly awarded.
Yusef, the fifths left back then
threw a spectacular diva-esque
tantrum, but Sugi kept his nerve
to coolly slot away the penalty.
The fifths then equalised
again through Dave Yates after
sloppy defending - that was
entirely my fault - following a
Caruso toe-punt, I mean free
kick. We then withstood some
concerted pressure but Pete was
never really tested following a
succession of long range efforts.
The pace of Sugi always gave us
an outlet up front and eventually
he latched onto a long pass only
to be body-checked by the fifth's
keeper who still continues to
protest his innocence despite
sending Sugi six foot up into the
air. A penalty was, once again,
duly awarded, and Sugi eventu-
ally picked himself up and dust-
ed himself down to despatch his
second goal of the game.
At 4-3 we believed the game
was ours following a superb
save by Pete to deny Gucci. But
in the last minute of the game
after a number of set pieces the
fifths managed to equalise fol-
lowing a goalmouth scramble.
To this day no one knows
quite how Gaetan managed to
score as he was trying to clear
the ball from his own area, but
one thing is for sure; neither
team will forget the match in a
very, very long time.
A Plea From the Editor
Can all teams either drop their
results into the Felix office or
send them - even if you can't be
bothered to write a report - to
sport.felix@ic.ac.uk as soon
after the event as they can? I
want to start a results service, to
keep everyone posted on the
results of our many teams, but
won't be able to without your
help.
