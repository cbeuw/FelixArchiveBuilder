Top-up Fees Paper Delayed
The governmental review critical to
the College's plans to charge top-
up fees has been delayed after the
resignation of Education Secretary
Estelle Morris. In the same week,
the Rector held a meeting with
staff and students to discuss both
top-up fees and the proposed UCL
merger.
The Great Hall and at least one
other lecture theatre were packed
as Imperial College members
attempted to ascertain how recent
announcements would affect their
degrees and research. While many
of the questions were fielded with-
out hesitation by the Rector, he
rarely tolerated open hostility from
those questioning him, replying
"Good!" when former Union
President Andy Heeps declared
that he was offended by the
Rector's answers.
The review is vital if the paper
recently passed at College Council
is to have any effect, and will have
to declare the Government's inten-
tion to give universities freedom to

charge fees above £1,050.
Estelle Morris is succeeded as
Education Secretary by Charles
Clarke, former Labour Party
Chairman, whose decision pushed
back the review's publication. The
implications of this delay for any
change of direction on Higher
Education policy is still a matter of
speculation. However, where Ms
Morris came from a background of
teaching, Mr Clarke has a history
including presidency of the NUS.
College staff were unable to com-
ment on how their plans would be
affected by the delay. AW
Halls and campus news, tip-offs and comments welcome!
