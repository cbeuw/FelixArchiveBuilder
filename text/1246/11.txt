High Street Kensington
This is the closest shopping area to
college and is a good place to nip
along in your lunch break. It isn't
nearly as scary as it sounds with
plenty of the high street chains.
Shops to visit-
Urban Outfitters: Fantastic shop!
Just the hippest shop you have
ever been in. The ground floor has
lots of kitsch stuff, useless but you
still want it. The clothes, both
male and female, are fabulous but
expensive, good in the sales
though. It also has a home depart-
ment with the funkiest cocktail
kits.
Diesel: Worth a mention, but I
think it is very over priced. Still I
wouldn't mind a pair of Diesel
jeans.
Zara: Another undiscovered treas-
ure by most women, much cheap-
er than it looks and with a very
good basics range.
Miss Sixty: Expensive, but fantas-
tic clothes for girls. Quite an intim-
idating store though.
Lush: I love this shop it is just
heaven.
The smell drifts out of the shop
and draws you in. For those of you
who haven't discovered it yet;
Lush is a shop that makes hand
made cosmetics.
This including bath bombs that
you drop in to a hot bath to fill it
with flowers or glitter or just to
make you smell fantastic. Massage
bars for you and your significant
other to enjoy and soaps piled to
the ceiling.
Good for girls who want a treat
and for boys who want to buy their
girls a treat, the staff are very help-
ful with out being too forceful or
overbearing.
Amazon: This is a group of shops
hidden up Kensington Church
Street, mainly full of crap but there
are hidden treasure like discounted
French Connection stuff.
H&M: Extremely cheap shop, full
of fab bargains but it takes a bit of
searching to find them. There are
actually two H&Ms within about
100 meters of each other, one
large and one smaller next to the
tube station.
A tip for this brand is to try
everything on before you buy,
many things that look fantastic on
the clothes hanger look terrible on
a real person!
Kings road
The essential street for posing, a
good place for car spotting
because everyone brings their
Ferrari's and Porches here.
This street has a lot of small
quirky little (expensive) shops,
with the extremely posh Sloane
Square at one end.
Miss Sixty - fantastic jeans
Within the budget:
Bluebird: Okay not strictly in the
budget, this is the Conran food
emporium. The food shop itself
has lots of possible presents and
imports that you can't get any-
where else including Oreo cookies,
yum!
Space NK: Fabulous cosmetics
store with brands like Stila and
Philosophy, expensive but the staff
really know the range so good if
you want something special or a
gift for someone.
Steinberg and Tolkein: A retro
clothes fantasy, glamorous dresses
and costume jewellery. Not cheap
but there is the odd bargain.
Lush: Again, but it really is fantas-
tic.
R soles: Again completely out of
budget but the best place to buy
fantastic cowboy boots. I believe
Madonna has a pair of these.
Reiss: A good men's clothing
store, not cheap but good for clas-
sic wardrobe staples. They have
started doing a women's range as
well, though I am not sure if this
store is stocking it yet.
Peter Jones: Right on the edge of
Sloane Square this is the ultimate
department store - it's huge! The
store isn't actually as scary as it
first looks and the prices are very
reasonable. The haberdashery sec-
tion is amazing with lots of little
sequins and feathers to customise
clothes with.
Knightsbridge
My tip is don't bother! Unless you
want to join the tourists to gawp at
Harrods or Harvey Nichols. There
are a few of the high street stores
down here but I have no time for
snobby shop assistants who disap-
prove of trainers.
Camden Market
Bloody marvellous place, just go
and soak in the ambience! Go on a
Saturday when all the markets are
on and take plenty of cash.
Camden tube station is mostly
exit only, so walk from here past all
the markets down to Chalk Farm
tube station to get back.
Rokit: A very, very good vintage
clothes store. Not the cheapest,
but definitely some good stuff.
Cold Steel: This is one of the
piercing and tattoo places in
Camden and if you're feeling brave
enough to get your belly pierced
this is a good place to go. They
looked clean enough when I was
there anyway.
There is another, bigger vintage
clothing store down in the Camden
Lock market whose name I can't
remember.
There are lots of other random
stores, the shoe shops are usually
pretty odd and very pricey.
Zara - Surprisingly cheap
Oh and if you buy a cheap
watch from one of the millions of
market stores selling them don't
expect it still to be working the
next day!
Portobello Road
Start off at Westbourne Park and
walk down to Ladbroke Grove or
Notting Hill.
This market has everything,
mainly tack though. A lot of
designers have started off with
stalls at this market so it can
sometimes be worth a look. The
antiques part of the market is usu-
ally packed so is to be avoided
unless you are looking for some
costume jewellery. Gail

The tastiest cocktail ever! The crushed ice is very important, if you
haven't got a proper ice crusher, try putting the ice in a strong plas-
tic bag, wrapping it in a tea towel and bashing it on the floor or
something.
For each drink you need the juice of one lime, 1 measure of Triple
Sec, 2 measures of Vodka and a top up of cranberry juice. Shake
together with some ice cubes then serve over the crushed ice.
Obviously any umbrellas or citrus slices increase the classiness of
this drink.
