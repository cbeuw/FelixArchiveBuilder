IC Virgins 5 - 1 7 Kingston
Hey kids, to keep a promise I
made to the faithful massive, I
would like to point out that this
week, Steve is boy of the week.
Two of our resident slappers are
on top form, and as I speak
Dappy 'the bigger tits the better'
Williams is being serenaded by
the entire thirds team. Yeah baby,
you love it, you slag.
So, to dedicate more than our
usual one sentence to the match
this week, a poor start put us
behind in the opening minutes.
With tackling still a problem -
strange considering we so used to
going down - and was our main
weakness. Two of their tries were
a result of continued forward
pressure, the first from a scrum
and the second from a line out. It
was at about this point that
Gemma had a distinct feeling of
deja vu when her opposite num-
ber seemed to be the bloke she
shagged last Saturday. Each of
their forwards had about a twen-
ty stone weight advantage - big
biffas they were - so scrummag-
ing was certainly a challenge.
Their number one was so large
that she had to wear a different
shirt from the rest of them - eek.
The third try was from their fit -
take that as you wish - full back,
who managed to sidestep the
entire team and score - take that
too, as you wish - under the
posts.
Most important of all, we must
come to our glorious try. ICU
baby, shaking that arse, shaking
that arse. So Gemma, who
shagged Steve, ran at high speed
into their stunned scrum half
who'd actually caught the ball off
their line out, caught the loose
ball and put it down over the line.
Oh the glory. We did nearly score

IC II 3 - 0 Kingston II
Imperial's seconds once again
defeated their opposition to con-
tinue in their unbeaten season so
far. Despite only having 10 players
on the pitch we managed an
impressive victory. After finding a
keen volunteer to be goalie in
Katherine she was the rock of our
already solid team.
Anna, Alice and Clare made
impressive runs up the wings, and
set up excellent goals for calm and
collected Marianne to drive in and
take the glory. The midfield did
their job well, with Ysanne and
Daisy providing excellent shots up
to the front.
On our final short corner Anna's
spectacular dive gave us a penalty
flick, which was neatly put away
by Brenda.
The defenders Nat and Jenny
quietly put paid to all of the oppo-
sition's attempts at goal.
All in all it was an excellent
match, and the seconds are on
track for their best season on
record.
IC I 5 - 2 Chichester I
There really is nothing to say
about the game, except that a
truly legendary victory was
recorded by the IC Mens hockey
firsts against a bunch of jumped
up, pompous little bastards from
Chichester.
IC III v St Mary's
St Marys were looking absent
from the kickoff. Their back line
was turned to vapour under
James Walker's fiery onslaught,
and total annihilation and proof
that St Mary's couldn't punch
their way out of a paper bag soon
followed, leaving us with a fifty
point walk over. Long live Silvia
and bring on the medics!
another try but I wasn't on the
pitch at the time, which obvious-
ly made all the difference.
Seriously, after a series of penal-
ties, we ended up camped on
their line and after Ling-a-ding
and Danielle Spatchcock chicken
tried to take it blind we lost the
ball, and it was blasted into
touch.
The second half of the match
was definitely our favourite bit.
We played well, our tackling
improved, along with our rucking,
mauling and general handling
skills. It did help that they were
yet another team of moaning
bitches who got so arsey and
pissed of that they gave away
numerous penalties that we,
unfortunately, couldn't take
advantage of. The comedy bitch-
ing of their backs did provide
some quality entertainment
though, albeit from 20 yards
away.
Other highlights include Becky's
flooring of their Steve
Doppelganger number eight,
Dorkwell actually catching the
ball, Priyah's kicking and tackling,
and Filthy's quality swimming hat
- there to protect her hundred quid
weave from the pounding rain
type evil weather.
Man of the match had to be
Snotty-Posh who managed to run
diagonally - but not flat - all over
the pitch, and coped with the
adverse conditions stunningly. Fair
play, she downed the pint eventu-
ally, but the gagging was just not
attractive. Love you Snots!
So to conclude, the match was
a very encouraging sign of great
things to come from the team: we
are well on our way to winning
various cups, leagues and
men/women.
A joke to finish: what's green
and smells of pig? Kermit's fin-
gers.
