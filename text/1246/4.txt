And Alex Said...
Why go to the effort of doing some-
thing today, when you can safely
put it off until tomorrow and spend
today happily vegetating, drinking
beer and wallowing in your own
filth? Who knows, you could be
decapitated by a stray Frisbee
tomorrow, and you're not going to
be thanking yourself for spending
your last day alive doing Problem
Sheet 18 then, are you?
If a new form of life evolves from
a leftover pizza, multiplies rapidly
and sends an army of giant killer
lobsters to take over London armed
with garden forks, and then, as one
of the foul-breathed, large-pincered
pink crustaceans grabs you by the
throat, will your last words, as he
jabs those three prongs into your
spine, be "Thank god I handed that
lab report in early"?
Probably not. No, my advice is
just to put off whatever you can for
as long as possible. And keep a
large pan of water always on the
boil. You never know when the lob-
sters will come.
When they do come, hopefully it
will be in the afternoon. Mornings
are just too painful. What fool
decided the working day should
begin at 9am? If some bastard
timetables a lecture for 9am, that
means I have to leave the house at
8.10, and if I'm going to be ready
to go, fully prepared, clean, fresh,
fragrant and dressed before I leave,
that means I have to get out of bed
at 8.07. That's at least six hours
before a man should naturally
wake, and the results can clearly
be seen in lectures.
At school, you were told off for
falling asleep in a lesson, and could
expect to be on the receiving end of
a well-aimed board rubber if you
dozed off. But at university, you're
supposed to be mature enough to
maintain consciousness throughout
your education. Just like you're
supposed to be organised enough
to get those problem sheets done
without anybody having to check
up on you. Carte blanche to do
bugger all really. As students take
advantage of their "responsibili-
ties", whole lecture theatres begin
to resemble dormitories, or perhaps
the scene of a carbon monoxide
leak, with students unconscious on
A4 pads and a man at the front
shouting mad gibberish.
You know when you're falling
asleep and you get random sen-
tences coming into your head?
Well, maybe it's just me, but if it's
9am and you're trying to write lec-
ture notes, you have to be careful
not to let the brain noise get in the
way of what you're supposed to be
studying. If you're not careful, you
can end up writing notes like "In
time t, if an energy E is transferred
to the man standing on the brick
goalpost with his battered, gelati-
nous hand clenched around a
whale's kidney, the conjecture is
true for all k." That's not much help
come revision time - you can't write
that in an exam. Perhaps I should
have done a Philosophy degree.
Then maybe nobody would notice.

Procrastinate
Summer In the US, Anyone?
A Presentation promoting next
year's exchange will be held on
Tuesday 5 November in Room
342, Mechanical Engineering
Building at 1:10 (until 2pm lat-
est). Application forms will be
available on the day. Further infor-
mation available on the UROP
web-site at
www.urop.ic.ac.uk/opps.html
The UROP (Undergraduate
Research Opportunities) program
provides many research opportuni-
ties within the college for under-
graduates to have the chance to
experience an academic research
environment. Unknown to many,
UROP also has a partnership with
the University of Delaware (UDel),
situated on the East Coast of USA
(about 2 hours or less from New
York and Washington D.C.) for an
exchange program where a group
of IC students swap places with
UDel students during the summer
(8-9 weeks) for research work. The
idea is to exchange knowledge and
cultural experience, widen your
perspective, make a whole load of
new friends and have lots of fun.
UDel is situated in Delaware,
which houses the Delaware
Memorial Bridge (world's largest
twin span bridge) and is known as
the First State since it was the first
to ratify the US Constitution in
1787. Among other things, UDel
is well known for having a good
undergraduate research program
in the US. It is also affiliated with
names such as DuPont and Gore.
UDel is a campus university, quite
unlike our dear Imperial College,
with beautiful buildings nicely
located within a planned land-
scape. It is in the town of Newark,
a university town where it's Main
Street (High Street equivalent) is
located about 3 minutes away.
That's 3 minutes away from good
and cheap food. If there is need,
you will be supplied with a bicycle
for you to bike around UDel and its
surrounding rural area.
For the keen sportsman/sports-
women, being a campus universi-
ty, UDel provides many free facili-
ties for our use such as indoor and
outdoor swimming pool, gym, rock
climbing room, athletic field and
others. We were located in an air-
conditioned accommodation with
tennis court, basketball court,
roller-hockey rink and football field
within the perimeter. There is also
a nearby green lawn where we fre-
quently play Ultimate Frisbee,
Whopper Ball or other interesting-
ly named games. American stu-
dents are sport enthusiasts so
there is good chance of you getting
invited for a game everyday.
For the traveller in you, there will
be no complaints. Every weekend,
trips are organised for the Summer
Scholars (that's us and other
American students) to cities nearby
such as Philadelphia, New York,
Washington D.C and Baltimore.
There are also trips to the beach,
soaking in all that hot American
sun or the mall (shopping for the
poor girls) or hiking in the nearby
forest reserve. If you are lucky, you
might even be invited to go on a
road trip in the oldest car you have
ever known to be alive (3 years
younger than you), which was con-
sequently donated to charity after
four days of the trip. Only if you are
lucky, I must say.
The research work itself varies
due to which projects you are
undertaking. Basically, you will
either have your own separate
project within a research group or
work closely in a research team for
certain objectives. There are many
interesting research projects, some
include visiting bridges around the
area (up to Brooklyn Bridge in New
York), and others offer usage of
interesting equipment such as
electron microscope to photograph
crystalline structure. The project's
success depends on you and your
initiative and you will be given full
support by your supervisors (some
include picnics and dinners).
Near the end of your stay, you
will be placed in a home stay for
two weeks. This means that you
will be living with American fami-
lies and experience a taste of the
American way of life. This might
include baseball games, sailing
boats, exchange of culinary
delights between your country and
USA, political discussions, huge
shopping malls, craft-making,
kayaking and much more (Fuhh..
that's a lot).
All in all, it was one of the best
experience all five of us had and
we recommend it to all of you.
