firsts run rampant
GKT I 2 - 3 Imperial I
Made our way to their
grounds in Cobham, on a
sunny Saturday mornin
only to find a mixture
leaves and long grass
where the pitches were
meant to be. But we
went out to play our
football!
We kicked off well
and were playing1
some pretty attractive
football, building the
play nicely from the
back, keeping possession
off the ball. And then
about 20 minutes into the
half, a through ball to
striker and alas! the skipper
(me) gave away a penalty! Well
- to quote the words of legends
of the past: "I... had to do some-
thing!" (repeat 43230 times). It
was all part of the greater plan
to make the game more interest-
ing, anyway. Penalty went in,
down 1-0. That didn't seem to
put us off though, so about 5
minutes after that we came back
to score. Clever throw in by
Joss, flick on header in the box
by Wez, and Mark with a cool
finish, 1-1. All square and all to
play for, and although we looked
the better side, it was pretty
even. And then, out of nowhere,
Wez comes up with a brilliant
turn on a through pass, to leave
their defender standing and
wondering where he was... one
on one with the keeper and 1-2
to us. Kept the pressure on, Anis
managing to miss - was it a
clearance? - a header on the
line! Then, from a corner the
ball falls to their man in the 6-
yard box, a shot finding Ant's
hand on the line. The ref
blows... penalty and a red card!
Carlos almost saved it, but the
ball ended up in the net. It was
all part of the greater plan! We
managed to keep it 2-2 till half-
time.
We had to keep playing 3 at
the back, as we wanted to win
this. Despite being down to ten
men we came out a lot stronger
in the
second half. They couldn't cre-
ate any real chances, finding a
solid defence in front of them.
Our midfield gave it their all,
taking control in the middle of
the park. And so, came the
chances... Jeff wasted a couple
- still part of the plan - but it
was time for us to put our third
away. Mathan was running
down the right, looked more like
he was dancing past players,
rather than dribbling, pulls a
great ball back to Jeff, who
made it 2-3 for us!
After that it was Imperial all
over. It took 15 minutes of good
defending and organised play to
reach full-time! 2-3 it was to
Imperial and a very well
deserved win! Congratulations
gents - mission accomplished.
Imperial 1 4 - 1 ICSM I
First home game this season
was against the medics. Can't
really see the point in playing
them, as we always win, but as
it's always fun to give the
medics a good beating - and it
was a nice sunny day as well -
so why not go? Started off quite
rusty, actually allowing them to
get the better of us for the first
10-15 minutes. It was around
then we decided to take things a
bit more seriously. We were
still not playing our best,
however, and around
25 minutes into the
half we got our
first. A lovely
through ball
brought Dave
one on one
with the
keeper, and
he finally
scored with
his second
shot - after
taking about
10 years. That
didn't really
seem to wake us
up either, but we
were still in total con-
of the game. Near the
end of the half, we got our
second: a cleverly taken corner
kick by Mark, picking out Joss,
who, using his head, placed it
beautifully at the top right cor-
ner.
In the second half things start-
ed to look a bit better for us,
although it was still not a very
good performance.
Wez came on 5 minutes into
the half, scoring his first IC goal,
within 3 minutes, with a shot
from the edge of the box. Our
fourth came not long after that,
another great delivery from
Mark's corner kick, Mathan tak-
ing advantage of his height (?) to
win the header at the penalty
spot, placing it over the keeper...
4-0. We thought the game was
over after that, so we relaxed a
bit too much. This unfortunately
allowed them to score. A dread-
ful mistake by the skipper (me)
and their man was through one
on one with Tim, beating him to
make it 4-1.
Even though we were not
happy with our performance, we
still give them the beating they
deserved. Which was nice.
thirds slip
IC III 24 - 35 Kingston II
A disappointing result to a hard
fought game - but at the end of
the day it's the team who
scores the most points who
win.
This game did prove beyond
any doubt that, if nothing else,
that the thirds are a team of
guile and flexibility.
Most of the team were play-
ing out of position throughout
the game, and even with a
mere fourteen men we domi-
nated the first half, only losing
points to the overlap created by
being a man down.
Mike's number eight pickup
try was lifted straight from the
hallowed pages of the RFU
coaching manual, and when
Dan came inside Alex (ahem -
ed) it really was a joy to watch.
'Hard Yards' - as Laurence
Dallaglio coined - was our
forte, not only from the for-
wards, notably from Sachin,
but also from the backs, such
as our fly half James 'Crash
Ball' Walker who played really
well and provided a great try
for Alex in his new position at
inside centre.
Man of the match had to be
Chris Gosden, who despite
playing out of position at scrum
half was confident and suc-
cessful. His kicking was excel-
lent and he provided the only
points that we scored from the
boot all game. His excellent
awareness also bore fruits in a
well earned try.
With ten minutes to go we
were trailing 24-25, so we
brought on Neil, and the rest,
as they say, is history...
Most importantly, though we
won the drinking game. Next
Stop St. Mary's.
