UCL Merger
As most of you know, last week it
was announced that Imperial
College was entering merger talks
with University College London.
The proposed merger must not
come as too much of a surprise.
This has been a trend within the
UK. Recent high profile mergers
have included UMIST and
Manchester, and Guildhall and
North London. There seems to be
a clear strategy to create large
higher education institutions that
can gain the "critical mass" to
compete on the global scale.
These mergers would radically
change the tertiary education
landscape in the UK.
The College is entering a wide
consultative process to consider
the key issues relating to the pro-
posed merger. A joint Board, con-
sisting of five members from each
College has been set up to look at
the proposed merger and it will be
focusing on the high level issues,
the so-called "icebergs" rather
than the detailed implementation
issues.
The Board has set up subgroups
to look at key areas of operation,
specifically academic, administra-
tive , governance and associated
academic issues such as libraries.
These subgroups will report to the
Board at the end of November and
the Board in turn will report to the
respective governing bodies on the
19th December with a view to
making a decision on that day.
So what is the Union doing? The
Union has called for a referendum
on whether the students believe
that Imperial College should
merge with UCL. This means
there will be a college wide ballot
of the students, so every student
will the opportunity to have their
say. The proposed dates for the
ballot are Monday 25th and
Tuesday 26th of November. There
will be two campaigns, one for Yes
and one for No, so you will have
the chance to hear all the pros
and cons of the proposed merger.
There will be debates and infor-
mation accessible to all. Similarly
UCL Union will also be calling a
referendum to gauge the view of
their students.
The Union will be neutral and aim
to provide facts and figures in an
unbiased way. The same informa-
tion will be provided to both par-
ties who in turn will present their
case to the student populous.
Once the referendum is complete,
we will have a clear indication of
the students' views and be in a
position to represent them to the
College and the Board.
This is potentially the biggest
change that Imperial College has
faced in its entire history. It is crit-
ically important that you are
involved in the process and have
your say. Make sure you get
informed, listen to the arguments
and make an educated choice.
