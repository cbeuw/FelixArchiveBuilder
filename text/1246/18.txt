Lostprophets 5/5
Saturday 12th October, Brixton Academy
Opening that evening were
Douglas, who came and went,
followed quickly by Audiovent.
Whether or not Jason Boyd was
purposefully trying to imperson-
ate his elder brother's stage
presence, it did shine through.
Unfortunately the band's out-
standing pedigree wasn't
enough, and you were left feel-
ing that something was missing.
The Movie Life jumped on stage
next and tried their best, but
they couldn't make up for what
must have been a very poor
sound check. The audience car-
ried on unperturbed though, and
a short time later our patience
was rewarded.
The Lostprophets earned their
reputation the hard way - on the
road. Gig after gig in small seedy
venues, slowly winning the
youth of the country over. Times
have changed however, and now
they're playing a large seedy
venue.
The throng now assembled
within the fake splendour of the
Brixton Academy welcome the
band on stage with high expec-
tations.
The hardcore tour schedule of
the past few years shines
through. The vocals hit every
note, with Ian and Jamie reach-
ing the pinnacle of their talent
during "and she told me to
leave" - even the onstage light
show is flawless.
You might think for all this
professionalism, the show might
seem contrived, but no. The six
men on stage radiate a conta-
gious energy, which infects the
crowd, made visible when the
entire venue starts jumping up
and down in time to the chorus
of Fake Sound Of Progress - the
title track from the album the
Lostprophets have been ped-
dling since 1999.
As they tore through this
album, injecting it with new life
in the process, we were treated
to the odd new song, slipping in
between the present classics.
These were impressive tasters
that did not disturb the pace,
sound or mood of the set - defi-
nitely a good sign of things
come. They proved once again,
there is nothing like pure
unadulterated talent turned up
to maximum volume.
Running through the album
track list in my head I realised
they were running out of stuff to
play. With only one song left the
Lostprophets finished on a win-
ner, Shinobi Vs Dragon Ninja,
And once again the venue
jumped together, with even more
energy than the first occasion.
All this and I still wanted
more, even if it was just the
same set played over again.
Alas, the encore never came and
the crowd were left clinging to
front man lan's promise of a new
album.

Mushroomhead 5/5
Wednesday 16th October, The Marquee
I was a little apprehensive about
this gig. Mushroomhead had
received mixed reviews from
most of the media and the fact
that they looked a little too much
like Slipknot didn't fill me with
confidence. I feel I should point
out that Mushroomhead have
been around for longer than
Slipknot and should not be writ-
ten off as a mere spin off. Still it
was somebody's job to review
them so, armed with pen and
paper, I arrived at the newly re-
opened Marquee. The first thing
I noticed about the stage was
that a group of roadies had
strung up a brown paper screen
in front of stage that obscured all
of the preparations. Then, after a
short wait, the lights dimmed
and strange noises began to
come from behind the wall of
brown paper. A couple of power
chords later the paper dropped
down to reveal all eight of the
band wearing pumpkin masks
combined with grey army outfits
(not too conventional but still
quite impressive looking).
Then began the music, a
strange combination of heavy
riffs, piano melodies (yes that's
right - piano), haunting backing
vocals plus some shouting for
good measure. The sound is
probably influenced by the likes
of Fear Factory and other metal
bands. There are also the the-
atrics. After their opening num-
ber the lights cut out for a few
seconds after which they reap-
pear in their more traditional
outfits, apart from backing singer
Jeffrey Nothing who was sport-
ing some sort of Darth maul out-
fit complete with full make up.
What can I say? I was very
impressed. Their sound was
crisp, they worked the crowd
well and once you got a feel for
the songs they were actually
quite good. If you're still scepti-
cal, my advice would be to listen
to a couple of their tracks and, if
you like what you hear, this is
definitely a gig worth seeing. If
you're a bit of a teeny-mosher,
grab your korn hoodies and mosh
your hearts off. In order to enjoy
this band even more have plenty
to drink to get you in the mood.

Albums
The Gloria Record - Start Here
Imagine a world where Vex
Red were brought up in a nice
neighbourhood, had all the
new toys and instead of being
the weirdoes at school were
the popular kids that every-
body liked. A world where Ross
Robinson preferred candy floss
and fluffy bunnies to guns and
crows' heads, and the only
road for a new band to go
down was the same road as
everybody else. Welcome, to
the world of The Gloria Record.
Not that any of this is neces-
sarily a bad thing, it's just that
when you sound like Chris
Martin on bad drugs and sing
about being made responsible
for people swallowing treesO?)
it becomes increasingly diffi-
cult to take you seriously. To
then inhale helium and
attempt an impression of Thorn
Yorke with a cold for half an
album is a bit ridiculous.
Ultimately, the semi-angst-
emo-lite leaves you with a dis-
tinct feeling that you've been
here before, you did all this
years ago and you have several
t-shirts to prove it. So while it
may be fun to spot the influ-
ences and come up with
bizarre sound-a-likes, in the
end tis an unrewarding and
boring experience.
