Albums & Live Review
Ron Sexsmith
Cobblestone Runway
4/5
Ron Sexsmith is a Canadian song-
writer, who also got divorced just
before starting the creation of his
album. Maybe it's the contrary -
the divorce led him to the album.
Anyway it's quite easy that
there is a strong synergy between
that sad event in Ron's life and
that album. Basically, there is
Ron's guitar and Ron's voice, a
warm, full one. And he's just say-
ing something like "Even if it's
hard, keep going". And as he did-
n't commit suicide after his
divorce, he's kind of an anti-rock
star and that's even better.
His songs always use the same
ingredients but in a different way,
song after song, that you can't be
bored if you liked the first one.
Here some strings and a piano
Gold In Them Hills, here with a
Lou Reed chorus These Days, a
beachy funk a la Jamiroquai
when he took his first 'l-love-
everybody' acid, and even, even
some gentle, discrete, useless but
charming electronic sounds.
I must admit that rapidly, Ron
can be compared to a Pritchard or
win the title of Prince of
Saccharose because of the sim-
plicity, purity we could say, of his
notions of friendship and love.
Something like the two first com-
mandments plus "After all we're
best friends". The title of his
fourth song God Loves Everyone
could complete Ron's nice monk's
suit.
But don't misunderstand, God
Loves Everyone is an answer to
the murder of a gay student in
Wisconsin and to the people
standing outside with their signs
saying "God hates fags" or "Burn
in Hell fags". Moreover, Ron
makes us feel good, it makes us
quiet and confident for he really
found the means to reach our hid-
den and laughable desire for bet-
ter things to come and for happi-
er days. And if you haven't any of
this kind of longing, the release of
Ron's album proves you're right.

Vex Red & Biffy Clyro
Friday 18th October, London Astoria
5/5
Judging by the crowd - huge
metal moshes, fans crushed
against the barrier, serious
crowd-surfing - I almost thought
I'd missed out on the support
band as I stepped into the
Astoria. But no, all this was down
to the latest craze among kid
rockers: Biffy Clyro.
With the same talent for pro-
ducing infectious riffs as emo-like
Rivals Schools and Jimmy Eat
World, Biffy Clyro seem to have
found the right formula for damn
good rock-pop anthems.
Tonight they are on top form
with simple refrains and strong
three chord melodies that you
just have to jump to. The four
Scots on stage must be loving it -
the crowd are actually singing
along, they know the lyrics and
what's more, they believe in
them with as much passion as
Biffy Clyro sing them.
The lads know what they're
doing when it comes to playing
live. They're together, they're
tight and they're firing out what
could be hit after hit. Their sound
builds on itself and rises in
relentlessly inspiring phases; a
teasing silence before the vocals
kick in and carry the emotional
wave back down.
Vex Red seem determined not
to be outdone by their support
act as they greet their metal
masses. For a band who have
come so far in such little time,
they step into the shoes of rock
stars with professionalism, confi-
dence and pride.
With no hesitation the band
fires up their opening track - bril-
liant and exemplary riffs, rocking
bass lines and electronica effects
that The Cooper Temple Clause
would be proud of.
Lead singer, Terry Abbott,
returns alone for the compulsory
encore. "We're just gonna have a
little break," he reveals, and then
quietly, ever so gently, he begins
to play. Fans previously busy
beating the shit out of each other,
stop and stare, mesmerised by
the sweet vocals of Abbott,
somewhat reminiscent of
Smashing Pumpkins' Billy
Corgan. Half-way through this
acoustic instant, three quarters of
the Astoria are crouching on the
floor, simply appreciating the sur-
prisingly tender moment. In a
very un-vex red-like manner, a
few lighters are swaying slowly
through the air. For a crowd that
have spent the entire night trying
to injure themselves by throwing
themselves at anything or anyone
in sight, the atmosphere really is
quite moving.
There's such power and pas-
sion in this band and some-
where, if you look a bit deeper, is
true talent. Keira
Singles
The Music - Getaway
More top-notch baggy psy-
chedelia from the northern
rockers that starts with an
insistent guitar melody, then
piles on layers of electronic
twinklings and warblings
before launching into a blaz-
ing chorus of metal riffs. With
everyone quoting influences
from the Stone Roses to Led
Zeppelin (underlined by
singer Robert Harvey's vocal
similarity to Robert Plant),
it's all too easy to dismiss
them as purely derivative,
but the sheer breadth of
experimentation that goes
into their songs confirms The
Music's status as one of the
most exciting bands in the
country right now. Both for-
mats of the single are due to
be deleted on the day of
release, so you'd better get a
move on.
5/5 Tom Bell
Earth Terranova - Running
Away
I must confess my ignorance
in not having heard the Bob
Marley original, so I was
unaware as to what to
expect. Thankfully, instead of
a like-for-like reggae cover
like The Fugees' No Women
No Cry, we get a trip-hop
remake with a female vocal.
Sadly, that's where the inno-
vations end, as the track
meanders along without pro-
viding anything that hasn't
been heard a zillion times
before. Much better is the
Naughty remix, which treats
the track to a funk-inspired
workout, slowly building to a
crescendo of vibrancy.
Whilst the master probably
won't entirely endorse this,
there have been far worse
crimes against his name.
3/5 Deepesh
