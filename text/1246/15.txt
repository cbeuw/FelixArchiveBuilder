Russian Rocket blows up
The Russian Emergencies
Ministry announced on
Wednesday that a Soyuz-U
space rocket has exploded. It
was an unmanned rocket, sup-
A spokesman from Russian
mission control said of the inci-
dent: "Serious conclusions will
have to be drawn, as a modified
version of this same rocket is
On the pathfinder mission, images were taken using rover robots
posed to conduct scientific
measurements with a Photon-M
satellite during a 15-day trip
around the Earth. It exploded 29
seconds after take-off despite
having a good safety record.
One man was killed in the inci-
dent and eight others were
injured.
due to take a group of cosmo-
nauts to the International Space
Station shortly." A spokesman for
the Russian space agency, Sergei
Gorbunov, said: "There are no
plans as yet to postpone the
flight." It seems likely that an
engine failure was to blame for
the explosion.
Starving millions
The UN has said that plans to cut people in the world, with women
world hunger by half before
2015 will probably fail, and it
could take a century to reach the
goal. The target was set in 1996
and children the most at risk.
This is more than a previous esti-
mate, with the main increase in
central Africa, but progress has
Starvation affects people world-wide
and would require the total num-
ber of hungry to reduce by 24
million a year. Considering that
25,000 people die every day
from poverty and starvation, to
meet the goal would require
progress to increase tenfold.
Current estimates show that
there are 840 million hungry
been made in China and South-
east Asia.
People described to be 'hungry'
might not actually be starving or
malnorished, but suffer the
effects of a poor diet with low
vitamin content. Possibly two bil-
lion people are affected in this
way.
I need 20 rubber chickens, all
with squeakers...

Research Proposal
Competition
After the stunning number of
responses I got to last week's
research proposal exercise
(exactly one response - see next
column) I have decided to up
the odds and offer a prize this
week. So if you want to win a
£10 HMV voucher then write
me a 100-200 word research
proposal explaining why you
need funding for 16 contact
lens holders.
Submit your entries to sci-
ence.felix@ic.ac.uk... The best,
as judged by me, will win the
voucher.
During my research into high ten-
sile-strength materials I discov-
ered, through a fortuitous accident
involving a dog and a cauliflower
(which I will not go into here), that
there is a particular type of rubber
with an incredibly high ductility.
This rubber is currently only used
in the manufacture of rubber
chickens, so I request sufficient
funds to purchase large quantities
of these chickens.
The first in a series of highly
technical and scientific experi-
ments will involve giving twenty of
these chickens to twenty hyperac-
tive children, which I can obtain
for free from a local council estate.
The children will play tug-of-war
with twenty large bulldogs using
the chicken as the rope. The dogs
can be obtained from the RSPCA
at no extra cost to the taxpayer.
Using close-up photography I will
observe the deformation of the
chickens, as they are stretched
and chewed up by the child-dog
pair.
I hope to be able to market the
rubber as a bridge building materi-
al that will rival even the materials
used to build the millennium
bridge.
