To Merge Or Not To Merge...
Hi Felix
So IC wants top-up fees, if the
government lets them. Bad news, I
guess, but: Still not critical. We can
voice our disagreement and protest
(but, please, not with GBP 31,000
adverts full of factual errors!!!!). We
can make sure the government
know about the problems, and hope
they will make the right decision
(i.e. to block top-up fees). And it's a
medium term issue. We have time
to oppose it.
The merger is not medium-term.
This is supposed to be decided by
December, and it is the worst news
for us I've heard in a while. Big may
be beautiful for finances and eco-
nomics, but a university is a rather
different thing. Universities are there
to educate and to do research - both
things for the greater good, and, no
matter what politicians may think,
not (just) for profit.
Put it like this: Before I came to
England, I tried to figure out which
universities (in Europe) would be
best for me (engineering degree).
Imperial and Cambridge came out
on top, together with a Dutch uni-
versity (TU Delft, I think, but I'm not
sure, I disregarded it because I don't
speak Dutch). UCL was not even on
the list. Imperial may be smaller
than either Oxford or Cambridge,
but it is also more selective in the
courses it offers. Our university
stands for a quality product - quality
education and quality research. And
it stands for science and technology
(and medicine) - subject areas at the
core of progress, and more impor-
tant to society than any humanity
could ever be.
Of course, we could join up with
UCL but at what cost? UCL is not
Imperial. It is not even LSE.
Internationally, it is an unknown.
LSE don't want us, which is a pity,
but given that their brandname is as
strong as ours, it's understandable.
But does that mean we have to pick
up any university with a campus in
London, just so we nominally have
more students, and look more
important? Together, the new
University would not be bad. But
would the combined thing be as
good as Imperial, i.e. world class?
No. We'd be above average. And
that, I'm afraid, is not good enough
for me. If I were to apply to univer-
sities next year, and face a combined
UCL/IC option, it would not feature
on my application form.
In that spirit, would anyone care
to organize a protest? ICU, perhaps?
Regards
I was at the Rector's meeting last
week, where he harped on about
the economic benefits that would be
reaped as a result of the proposed
IC/UCL merger, and how we would
all come to realise the wisdom of his
plan, once we saw the evidence.
Does he not realise that the opposi-
tion to this proposal might stem
from something other than concern
about whether we were going to
turn a profit from this? I'm talking
about patriotism to our university -1
don't want to see IC lose its identity
becoming just another faculty of
some London super-university,
which it most certainly would, when
faced with the larger, and let's face
it, more well-known UCL. Imperial
has only just gone through a merger,
incorporating the medical schools
into the college - and we all know
that isn't now the happiest of mar-
riages. The same sort of marginal-
ization experienced by medics
would happen to the whole of IC,
only this time, there wouldn't be the
chance for the same sort of insulari-
ty that the medics employ. IC, under
a merger, would just be swallowed,
overwhelmed by the larger UCL,
and the IC ethos and interests would
be cast aside in the interests of the
new institution.

More Topping Up
Dear people,
It seems to me that many IC stu-
dents think "top-up fees" are
inevitable, consequently thats why I
think a significant number of IC stu-
dents arn't interested in taking any
sort of action. I think it is safe to say
that the majority of IC students are
against the top up fees, therefore "us
lot" are in our thousands. Whilst
there is only one man at the top who
wants to push these top up fees
through. So when you think about
the potential mass oppostion, these
changes are far from inevitable!!!
And so, ladies and gents, girls and
boys, I think it's about time more of
us, including me, got more engaged
in opposing these outrageous top up
fees. Yours expectingly,

Dear Felix,
Is Syksey-boy's core proposal that
those wanting a good education
should have to pay for it, providing
that they are able, really such a bad
one? The answer, methinks is yes...
ish
Is it not fair that an individual
from a fairly affluent background (as
the typical IC student is despite
what they may say) and who is also
quite likely to get a well paid job,
should have to pay for it? Well, yes,
i think so. Is it not also true that the
college will have to find some way to
make up the £2500 per student per
year that Sykes claims it loses
through inadequate government
funding? Again, of course it must.
But top-up fees aren't the answer.
Syke's proopsals aren't actually all
that bad, providing that you start of
wealthy-ish and get a well-paid job
afterwards, but that is too often not
the case. We all know, that if you go
into research/academia, the salaries
are rarely as good as those to be
gained elsewhere, and are barely
adequate to pay off the current lev-
els of £15k student debt let alone
the likely £25k with top up fees.
This will only discourage IC students
from taking up research positions,
and act as an itellectual drain for the
college.
Equally the Rector's assertions
that students will be accepted on
quality only, and that money will be
taken care of later, are very short-
sighted. We all can cite examples of
friends who chose not to come to
London on a cost basis. So although
the system may not officially dis-
criminate against the less wealthy,
in reality it is likely that some degree
of the financial elitism seen in the
Ivy League will occur.
So where should the money come
from? The fairest method would
seem to be some sort of graduate
tax. That way, there is no disincen-
tive to go into research (which sure
the college wants and needs), and it
means that those seeking their
degree purely to help them earn
more money, pay what they deserve
to.
Yours,
Jon Field
Southside
I was meaning to write here a long
time ago about Southside shop. I
am surprised no one else has!
When Basics Pizza was taken
over by the Southside shop, I had
my doubts... Pizzas were good at
Basics (well, on a basic level any-
way), and the little Shop had such
a bad reputation for having over-
priced items... even more expen-
sive than Harrods in some cases!
However, I loved the French crois-
sants, so I knew I should give it a
chance.
Then they decided to make piz-
zas., which was a good idea, as
we all need a good nibble when
we are drinking ourselves to the
ground. But the shop closes at
9pm and they stop serving food at
8.30pm.. who in their right mind
has thought about food by that
time on a night out?? 8.30pm is
right about when you start think-
ing about having a pizza! After a
couple of trials, I decided against
them anyway.
Then there is the bread. A loaf
cost £1.15. That in itself is outra-
geous. Three times the price of a
supermarket loaf. However, one
could think that you are not pay-
ing that price for the actual bread,
but for the convenient location of
the shop, and the fact that it is
open "late"... I could cope with
that. But what a furious reaction I
had when I realised that only loafs
with best-by-dates for the next day
were for sale! Obviously, I experi-
enced that first-hand a couple of
times (by eating stale bread)
before I realised this was a shop
policy!
Finally, there is the mice. Have
you ever looked through the win-
dows into the shop after closure?
Last time I looked, there were half
a dozen mice making a feast of
what was left over in the "freshly
prepared" food section. It isn't the
first time I see this, and I am not
the only who has noticed it either!
So basically, I am wondering
why on earth the College has let
the Southside Shop area to a
bunch of lazy French, who have
overpriced gone off items (if not
run out of stock), are closed on
Sundays and most importantly
don't clean stuff out well enough
to avoid mice infestation!
