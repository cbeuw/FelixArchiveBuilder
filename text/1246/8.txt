Balls In Barbados
It was an early autumnal day in a
London park. Bitter PopRival fans
on one side reeling from the ugly
guy's departure the night before,
tourists on the other side taking a
short break from the open top bus.
The Caribbean shores felt thou-
sands of miles away. In the sum-
mer of 2002, 10 of the IC net-
ballers lived every university girl's
dream: a fortnight in Barbados.
There was drinking, dancing,
famous footballers, and a few
games of netball on the way. We
were competing in the 4th annual
Bajan Unifest 2002, with 110
other sportspeople from universi-
ties in Britain, USA and Barbados,
covering the sports of netball,
hockey, cricket and football.
Barbados is where it's at when it
comes to netball. Men and women
alike play it, follow it and under-
stand it, and they get the fantastic
results.
Saturday 22nd June: The morn-
ing after the night before. It's a
mystery how we all made it to
Gatwick, but we did, all be it in a
variety of physical states. Eight
hours, 4 films and an ice cream
later, we landed in sunny, breezy,
palm-tree-packed Barbados.
Virgins to rum punch, this was the
night that changed our lives and
shaped them for weeks to come.
The "Unifest Welcome Party"
kicked off at a nearby hotel.
Conditions deteriorated when our
leader Jo Harvey leaped into the
hotel pool fully clad, briskly pur-
sued by 40 Heriot Watt boys...
Sunday 23rd June: Our first
intensive training session...on the
beach...in between sunbathing.
There was an official Opening
Ceremony for the Unifest competi-
tion, and the Imperial Ladies were
about to play the first game of the
tournament.
Fixture 1: Venue Sir Garfield
Sobers Sports Complex, Team:
Carrington, Barbados
The IC touring team is unbeaten
in Britain. It arises from the fact
we had never played together
before. Leading from the start, we
finished with a draw at 11-11, not
bad for our first game. In the
hottest conditions we've ever
played in, games were only in 15-
minute halves, rather than our
usual 15-minute quarters. The
end of the games showed notice-
able superiority to the local teams
as they had barely broken sweat,
whilst we were close to needing
hospital treatment.
No one was injured during the
tour. Any accidents were always
alcohol related
Monday 24th June: White sandy
beaches, big waves in a warm
sea, palm trees, Chefette (the
Caribbean's answer to
McDonalds), and strawberry milk-
shakes for Holly. What a life! The
Harbour Lights nightclub is one of
the most famous on the island.
downpour would have been quite
homely and it made us feel the
advantage of being English.
However, the advantage was lost
when the opposition ran off the
court for shelter. The game was
abandoned and declared a draw.
Earlier in the day, the IC netball
team were alleged to have been
seen building a human pyramid
on the beach. It was Jo who had
to climb to the top of the pyramid,
but nose-dived off the summit,
resulting in a face full of sand,
wonky glasses, and 9 laughing-so-
much-it-hurts mates standing
beside her. It was all, however, in
aid of the Unifest Talent Show at
The Rusty Pelican that night. With
For Â£8.00 entry fee, we had free
drinks all night. Stilt-men were
encountered, and woo-ed. Clare
demonstrated her ragga singing
skills in Carribbean karaoke, and
we danced the night away with
the New Zealand cricket team.
Tuesday 25th June Fixture 2:
Venue: Sir Garfield Sobers Sport
Complex, Team Eden Stars,
Barbados
A team, the mere mention of
whose name sends shivers down
the spine of every Bajan man and
woman. They were a far better
team than Carrington, possessing
the rather fortunate gift of go-go
gadget arms. We lost the first half
7-2. Sherry came in as
Goalkeeper and put in a fantastic
performance, as she did in all
games. Following a defiant come-
back, the heavens opened. Had it
not been warm, the torrential
a highly polished dance
routine(one that the IC Rugby
boys, who came to Barbados in
week two, were treated to many
drunken viewings of), the human
pyramid had only been practiced
on the sand. A tiled and slippery
floor was not the finest morale
booster. However, Jo made it to
the top of the pyramid with ease
(the power of rum punch) and
flashed to the cheering crowd - in
her own words, "Nakedness wins,
girls, nakedness wins". We lost.
We spent the evening drowning
our sorrows and learning how to
dance Bajan-style with the
Carrington Netballers. Holly and
Stuxy proved to be naturals (or
was it that they were the most
drunk..)
Wednesday 26th June Fixture 3:
Venue: National Stadium Team
Barbados Under 16s.
Today we were representing
England in a battle of the nations,
playing the Barbados Under 16s
at their national stadium. It could
have been a car park actually, but
we were assured that it wasn't.
The temperature was intense; the
court had high concrete walls sur-
rounding it, the sun beat down.
The U16s were an outstanding
team, playing beautiful netball
and we lost 21-6. The old girls
among us (Jess, Kath, Hannah
and myself) were happy that our
last game together representing IC
was against a national team, and
that it had been a great game. It
led, of course, to another scan-
dalous night at Harbour Lights
involving stiltmen, Heriot Watt
boys and vast amounts of rum
punch.
Thursday 27th June: The Unifest
Beach Party at The Boatyard.
There was jet-skiing, kayaking,
beach volleyball, football and
kayak-racing (in which Jo crashed
into a very large, very obvious,
quite how she didn't see it no one
knows, inflatable iceberg). Sherry
lives in Barbados and introduced
us to the craziest bus service I
have ever had the misfortune of
coming across. Taxis with a seat-
ing capacity of 10. Except they
don't seat 10. For $1.50, we
could get wherever we wanted, at
an insane speed, on a pot-holed
road, listening to ragga music very
loudly, with 22 other people
wedged above, beneath and
beside you. We met Sol Campbell
that evening, signifying the start of
a beautiful story between him and
one of us. So that the girls can
avoid hassle from the tabloids, I
shall leave the story there...
Friday 28th June: Another inten-
sive training session on the
beach.. Virgin Atlantic held a
shoot-out competition in which
whoever got the best out of 3
goals won a return trip to
Barbados. Hannah and Holly were
the only girls to score 1. A defend-
er from St.Marys won. Off to
Oistins Fish Fry Market in the
evening, yet more drinking games,
and finishing off in Harbour
Lights,again. All that can be
remembered is Clare returning
