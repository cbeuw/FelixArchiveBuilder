I M E T the Deputy President,
(straight from one of his in*
numerable committee meetings)
in the Union ^ r and he offered
to buy me a, drink — which in
the days ot d i m i n i s h i n g grant
buying-power, doesn't often
happen to me; regretfully I had
to admit that I'd. already got
one. He shepherded me into the
lounge, suggested a table, and
through the din of the juke box
tried to communicate to me his
views on himself and the task
of being D . P .
H i s main platform for
election, he told me, was the
condition o' some of the union
f a c i l i t i e s , for which the D P
via the House Committee, is
responsible. The J C R furniture
for instance, which is falling
apart:
'I've just had the estimate
for its renovation, arid it works
out at about £2500. The chairs
at present have rubber webbing
under the seats, most of which
has torn. When they've been
repaired they'll be like these
ones' — he grabbed a nearby
chair by the leg and flicked it
onto its back — 'with a wooden
base. Much more durable. And
the floor here' — he waved his
hand at the floor of the lounge,
which looks as if it has caught
some unspeakable d i s e a s e —
'Is in a mess. We are going to
cover it with a cord carpet. It's
hard wearing and cheap but it
will cost a fair bit!'.
Ron a l s o s i t s on the Safety
Committee, w h i c h is res-
ponsible for the safety of a l l
the college buildings:
'College safety is not as
good as it might be', he
commented. 'We are trying to
educate everyone to be more
safety conscious. Many im-
provements can be made without
much effort, like the new
luminous fire signs in the Union
building'.
I a s k e d him how he finds
out what the students want in
the way of f a c i l i t i e s :
'/ like to think my views
reflect the views of the
average IC student. I've found
from talking to people I meet
that surprisingly often their
views and mine agree'.

A l l the same, he wishes more
people would come and give him
their opinions on the things
they feel he ought to be doing.
The general student's d i s -
interest in union matters i s , he
thinks, at least partially due to
the fact that the Union is doing
approximately what most
students want it to.
Ron enjoys being Deputy
President, and looks on it as
being to some extent light
relief from his research work
in Bio-organic Chemistry.
'Research is frustrating.
If chemical A will not react
with chemical B , you won't
change matters by reasoning
with them. But people are much
more flexible. You can persuade
them to see your point of view'.

Although I have been known on a number of o c c a s i o n s to com-
plain about the work involved in ICWA, I shall a l s o be the first to
admit the perks of the job.
The weekend before last I was given what I regard a s an opp-
ortunity of a lifetime - the chance to fly in a glider. The captain of
the G l i d i n g C l u b at IC, N i g e l
Leak, and his committee,
decided to offer me the chance
to experience this incredible
sport in the hope that I would
then be able to write this
article to encourage some of the
more adventurous women amongst
us to join.
I should first like to give you
some idea of the way the week-
end was spent rather than just
space fill with my feelings over
the matter.
I, together with Sue Tanner
( P h y s i c s I), were picked up on
the Friday night by Nigel and
driven to the Lasham A i r f i e l d in
Surrey. On first sight, It was a
little daunting but after a little
Dutch courage at the local our
s p i r i t s rose considerably.
In the morning it rained, in
the afternoon it snowed!! Not
the most encouraging weather
for gliding — not for any sport
in fact. We were shown round
the workshop (fondly known a s
the Brown Elephant!) where I
saw my first glider c l o s e to. I
found it difficult to believe
something so fragile looking
could make me airborne. H o w -
ever, the actual strength of
these gliders is undoubtable -
this one certainly did not
c o l l a p s e under my weight!
In the evening we were
treated to a superb pub meal,
accompanied by a lovely
selection of home brewed
w i n e s . Enjoyable a s this was,
it was not the most ideal
preparation for the following
day.
We were, c a l l e d at 7.15a.m.
to look out onto a perfect clear
sunny but very frosty morning.
We arrived on the runway at
8 o ' c l o c k and were scolded for
being late, a w e l l deserved
comment as already the gliders
were out and ready to fly. The
gliders are towed into the sky at
Lasham in two ways — by aero-
tow or by car tow. In the former
you are pulled up into the sky
to about 2,000 feet by a s m a l l ,
powered aeroplane; in the latter,
a car speeding along the runway,
hoists the glider into the s k y .
I was aero-towed into the sky
at 8.30a.m. in a two-seater
glider with my instructor Doug
sitting behind me.
T h i s part of the flight, the
tow was superb — the view being
like a dream with pockets of
morning mist dotted around the
countryside (it was possible to
see Watership Down from here\.
Then came the slight shock a s
the tow rope was released and
we were just floating in the air.
I must admit, I felt rather scared
but it was immensely e x c i t i n g
too. The nasty bit is exper-
iencing the abnormal balance
feelings you get though I was
assured that after one or two
more flights one is hardly aware
of them. I was allowed to.
experiment with the controls'
for a little while and then we
made for the landing s t r i p .
Landing, surprisingly, (as I
thought I would be scared stiff)
was really great fun. A n d there
ended my flight.
The hospitality and kindness
of the people of the c l u b —
both of IC and Lasham itself —
was superb throughout and I
should l i k e to thank a l l of them
now for such a good weekend.
The expense? Y o u can afford
to glide on a grant without a
doubt but one a l s o has to give
up the time to really make a go
of it. F o r details of the cost I
suggest you contact Nigel L e a k
in A e r o E n g . II or Indeed,
myself. The IC G l i d i n g C l u b is
the second oldest In the country
and Is a w e l l established, w e l l
run organisation. It is a lot of
fun, but a l s o a lot of hard work.
But the feeling of g l i d i n g
through the a i r as a bird is just
indescribable — so do try it for
yourself.
