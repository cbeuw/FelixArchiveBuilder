Penguin Modern Poets (Fontana)
With the publication of this new volume,
Penguin have now introduced us to 7 5
contemporary poets, an admirable achieve-
ment. When viewed a s a complete
anthology, the series presents us with an
invaluable collection from which we can
a s s e s s the calibre of modern poetry in
B r i t a i n . In the last decade we have lost,
among others, E l i o t , Pound and A u d e n ;
it is not inconceivable that their eventual
s u c c e s s o r s w i l l emerge from among poets
s u c h a s these.
On the strength of this offering, how-
ever, I do not think that the three poets
whose work i s represented here — G a v i n
Ewart, Z u l f i k a r Ghose and B.S.Johnson —
are likely to finish in the select band of
poets for whom the adjective 'great' is no
exaggeration. A s with a l l the writers
Penguin have offered u s , their work i s of a
very high standard in general, and a l l
three could be described a s s u c c e s s f u l ;
but there are many others just a s good.
Their work, although competent, does not
progress in any way from the standards
laid down in the last thirty years. T h i s i s
one of the major criteria in d i s t i n g u i s h i n g
the major poets from those who are just
w e l l practised in the art of writing verse.
To reach their standard is an achievement
in itself, and for that reason I c a n
recommertd the book as a suitable intro-
duction into modern poetry. Some of the
work i s very good; it never drops below
competent. It is a l s o , for the most part,
eminently readable. But don't ex.pect too
much from it, enjoy it, and remember'that
minor poetry is the lifeblook of literature.
Arianna Stassinopoulos: The Female
Woman (Fontana)
The Womens Liberation movement h a s
been observed with fervent admiration,
amusement and c y n i c a l contempt. M s . ,
sorry, M i s s Stassinopoulos i s firmly
entrenched in the latter grouping, and this
book is a detailed attack of the tenets of
the present liberal females who hope to
elevate the status of women to that of the
all-domineering males. Hovering in the
Little Feat: Dixie Chicken (Warner
Bros)".
A N O T H E R quality album from a band
that produce consistently good music and
remain consistently unnoticed. The opening
title track moves in with a shuffling beat
sprinkled with honky-tonk bluesy piano
and the unique larynx of L o w e l l George,
who goes on to power the whole package
with rasping slide guitar. T h e m u s i c i a n -
ship is typically tight a n d precise although
giving the appearance of laid-back
relaxation, as if at any moment they
background are the e v i l spectres of
Germaine Greer and Kate M i l l e t ; these two,
in particular, are singled out for repeated
and often hostile c r i t i c i s m . M i s s
Stassinopoulos uses a great deal of
' b i o l o g i c a l ' reasoning, which is impressive,
but at times lapses in i l l o g i c a l , common-
sense arguments; however, we have been
brought up to expect this from women, and
as the lady is obviously an all-female
female I suppose she thinks s h e can get
away with it. Not so, M i s s S., not s o .
The book deals in a systematic way
with the various roles a woman has in
society, and attempts to reason that these
are, in the main, natural. I'm sorry, ladies
of IC, but a lot of it makes sense. On the
other hand, I think she is being unfair in
trying to destroy the liberation movement,
in that she clearly does not understand it.
I personally see womens L i b . a s a move-
ment which is suffering from over-reaction
to the problem. T h i s is only natural because
of the huge, fallacious tradition present in
most societies which believes that women
are an inferior race. Given time, the
movement should settle down to a reasoned
battle against prejudice; the answer to the
problem does not lie in the ashes of M s .
Greer's gutted bras, nor in this book.
If there are any ardent Womens Libbers
in IC, I recommend that you have a look at
this book, even if it only results in high
blood pressure. Its semi-facetious tone
suggests hope that M i s s Stassinopoulos is
not quite s o anti-liberation a s the book
may seem to imply.

'Modern Man Looks at Evolution'
W.W.Fletcher (Fontana).
With evolution a s its underlying prin-
c i p l e , this book sets out to cover everything
that has evolved, from the inception of
the universe to present day s o c i e t y .
Unfortunately, (it w a s a great idea, but
what c a n you expect in 160 pages?), it
fails d i s m a l l y .
More s e r i o u s l y , it a l s o claims to be a n
'ideal introduction for the non'scientist
into the ways of science' which I find very
hard to s w a l l o w . T o my mind whole
sections df the book, e s p e c i a l l y on the
astronomy s i d e , were little more than
tedious cataldgues of facts that can be
found in any yearbook, let alone ency-
c l o p a e d i a . T h e general level of
treatment, e s p e c i a l l y towards the front of
the book, is pretty sketchy, but I suppose
that this is inevitable in such a limited
might miss a beat or two but never in fact
do.
The key to the band is the vocals and
slide-playing of L o w e l l George. He has
complete control of the instrument and>
seems capable of imparting some blood-
and-guts to the sould — usually the
prerogative of straight electric guitar.
Because of this the music in its com-
plexity is more invigorating than say a
comparable band such as the A l l m a n
Brothers.
With luck, they might finally make it on
the Warner Brothers package tour currently
doing the rounds here, where, if there's
account. A l l the same we find a n
assumption of basic concepts on one hand,
and over s i m p l i f i c a t i o n of ideas on th^
other. There is a l s o a liberal use of magic
words l i k e 'scientist', 'energy' and
'proteins' and too many throw-away
phrases such a s (talking of the moon
landings and probes) 'we now know nearly
as much about the surface of the Moon as
we know about the surfate of the Earth'.
I didn't find the plates particularly ,
illuminating either.
The main fault of this volume Is that it
is trying to cover much too wide a field at
too elementary a level. T o appeal to the
totally ignorant layman a more direct and
exciting approach is needed, while the
serious amateur with only basic knowledge
w i l l find it superfluous.
'Occasions' Dorothy Hammond Innes
(Fontana)
'Occasions' is not a book that I
expected to enjoy, being almost, the
absolute antithesis of my travelling
experience. Used to economy c l a s s ,
camping and w a l k i n g to s a v e bus fares, I
find the whole idea of l i v i n g in hotels and
taking cars a bit strange. S t i l l , i t ' s
always good to see how the other half
lives, and to my surprise I really enjoyed
glooehopping with Mrs. Innes. F o r devotees
of the Mr.H.Innes, this scrapbook has some
interesting if obvious background glimpses,
to h i s novels: the A u s t r a l i a n outback and
'Golden Soak' for e x a m p l e .
Make no mistake, though, this travelogue
is nothing more than a string of remin-
iscences of people, places and events on
a culinary thread. I found the discriptions
of meals just a bit wearing after a while
and they kept making me feel -hungry.
Although I'm no epicure (or even a decent
cook), I w i s h there had been an appendix
of recipes to try.
The book is full of fun & enjoyment;
a typical bit is where the Innes' & pilot
are flying towards the Olgas — another
Ayers Rock sort of t h i n g . " / was studying
Harry Purvis' fine profile when I heard
my husband say 'Oh, don't worry about
Dorothy, she loves it'. I was Just wonder-
ing what I was alleged to love when he
rolled the plane over and we crawled up
the face of the Olgas, then down, then up
again, slowly, very close to the details
of the surface".
If you like travel and talking about
places, y o u ' l l like this easy, flowing
book. It's certainly more absorbing than
any of the holiday-slide vignettes that I
was treated to last year. I would expect it
to be reviewed on Womans Hour and
rightly s o : your m i s s u s or your mum w i l l
probably think i t ' s great.
Hie
any iustice left, they deserve to stomp a l l
over some of the bigger names on show.
T h i s album is their third, and although
not up to the excellent standard of
'Sailin' Shoes' remains strongly and
unmistakeably L i t t l e Feat. There's the
insistent, haggerdly drumming of R i c h i e
Hayward, the stoned-out piano of B i l l
Payne and the drawling blues-based
stance of George — ' t ' s a shame that
lesser music can become s o popular and
so many musicians of true quality go
unnoticed.
