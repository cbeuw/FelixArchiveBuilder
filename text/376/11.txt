B e c a u s e of a disastrous
Gutteridge C u p result for I C
last Wednesday, fitness training
for the first X V had been ex-
tended to Friday evenings.
Press-ups, pull-ups and sit-ups
were not encouraged but a more
special exercise such a s too
much Young's bitter w a s pre-
ferred. Undaunted by this
servere test of stamina the
Brave Bandits belonging to
Bruce Bradley set off to avenge
the aforementioned 11-3 defeat
by Q M C .
Before the match started i t
was decided that tea a n d
biscuits should be served to
both the backs and forwards to
help keep out the effects of the
consistent d r i z z l e a n d biting
cold wind. Unfortunately s i x
minutes into the first half the
forwards were still dunking their
biscuits and consequently were
too busy to stop a P L A forward
from crashing over from a
quickly taken short penalty.
Ten minutes later I C were
awarded a penalty thirty yards
out and i n front of the posts.
B . F i n n e y elegantly converted
and reduced the score deficit to
6-3. T h e adverse wet con-
ditions made handling the ball
extremely difficult a n d both
sides found i t hard to produce
clean possession from the
lineouts. Unfortunately I C were
reduced to 14 men, ten minutes
later, when B.Stern h a d to
retire with a badly bruised arm.
H e w a s , however, expertly
looked after by our resident
Florence Nightingales, Janet
and A n i t a . It i s thought that
next week the two girls are
having their heads examined for
hanging around in such miserable
weather.
H a l f time came a n d went.
The reshuffled I C side c o u l d
make no impression on the
score line despite constant
good pressure from the forwards
and steady play from the b a c k s .
Four minutes of the game re-
mained. T h e spectators were
on tender hooks and excitement
mounted to a climax. R a y
Hughes, a foimer good player
with a l l h i s teeth, received
good ball from the pack five
yards from the P L A line. B e -
cause I C h a d had a two-man
overlap from h i s blind-side
break, R a y decided h e ' d better
go alone a n d snook i n for the
winning try. A minute later the
ref blew up but no one was hurt.
It w a s a deserved w i n a n d
hopefully the side w i l l now
carry on without l o s i n g for the
rest of the season.

IC Extra 1 sts welcomed the
return o f their star player, top
try scorer and captain for their
match against London Irish.
Surprised that the game had not
been c a n c e l l e d we arrived at
Harlington to find a c o l d wind
that w a s blowing at approx
lOOmph (nearly a s fast a s
S.Chudy) across the pitch. H a d
it not been for this wind we may
have run up a much bigger
score a s i t played havoc with
the p a s s i n g . London Irish were
not a s affected since the I C
front row won so much b a l l ,
with great hooking by I.Shepherd,
that they rarely had a b a l l to
pass.
The I C backs d i d w e l l
cleaning up loose ball to stop
L I getting any loose breaks,
M.Gibson (not that one) doing
very w e l l i n this dept. T h e I C
pack pressurised s o well
charging through lineouts on the
opposition half bakes that we
spent most of the first half on
their half. M . K i l b r i c k at N o . 8
forced the L I wingforwards and
scrum half to give away pen-
alities by holding the ball i n .
Our first try came from a
charge down by R.Sutton, who
had charged through the lineout,
the ball bounced just right for
S.Chudy who ran the last 5 y d s
and dived over with half the
opposition on h i s back. T h e
wind d i d not help the con-
version attempt but H.Sayers
later placed a penalty k i c k over
(London Irish disagree) to give
us a half time lead o f 7-0.
The second half w a s the
more even o f the two with the
ball going backwards and
forwards. T h e wingers who
didn't get many passes chased
k i c k s in attack and covered w e l l
in defense and London Irish
were lucky to get their con-
verted try. M.Gibson w a s
unlucky not to score after a
good run by M.Sergot but a last
ditch effort just caught h i m .
F i n a l score 7-6.
Cheers lads, sorry you can't
a l l get mentioned, (I take up too
much of the report).
