Imperial College,
24th Jan., 1975.
Dear Sir,
I am writing on behalf of the
proposed IC Sporting Motor-
c y c l e C l u b i n response to
Rupert Harper's 'Motorcycle
Column' (FELIX No. 3.74). I
wish in no way to c r i t i c i s e
Rupert's letter even if he might
have antagonised a certain
Norvin owner and spelt my name
wrong.
I too think this Honda we are
wanting to race i s a good idea,
but £200, in my opinion, i s a
fair price, having just glanced
through a few back copies of
Motor C y c l e N e w s . I a l s o
believe that the first priority
of the C & G Motorcycle Section
i s to find a good workshop.
However, there are a l s o in IC a
number of people who are not
only interested in maintaining
their own b i k e s , but a l s o in the
sporting side of the motorcycle
spectrum. However, one needs
money to go racing, scrambling
or whatever, and this is where
we would come i n .
The C & G Motorcycle Section
i s , as i t s name i m p l i e s , a
section of the C & G Motor C l u b .
If the C & G Motor C l u b had the
finances to race, no doubt they
would prefer to race a car, or
perhaps extend the f a c i l i t i e s of
their already e s t a b l i s h e d Go-
kart and P e d a l C a r Sections.
F o r this reason it was decided
to go ahead and form an I C
Sporting Motorcycle C l u b . Thus
this c l u b would direct its
energies towards motorcycle
sport. T h i s c l u b i s i n no way
intended to rival the C & G
Section.
We already have the f a c i l i t y
through the Southern 67 R a c i n g
Club and the B r i t i s h Motorcycle
R a c i n g C l u b L i m i t e d ('Bemsee')
to marshall at Snetterton and
Brands H a t c h . A s a m a r s h a l l ,
one naturally p a y s no entrance
fee to the race meeting, i s given
free meals, and, most important,
is involved in the meeting itself,
Marshalls are able to select
which meetings they attend.
There i s a one day T r a i n i n g
Course on Saturday, February
1st, 2.30 to 5.30p.m. at Brands
Hatch, if you are interested
please see Martin B l e a s d a l e ,
Room 674 Selkirk H a l l .
If anyone supports the
forming of our club, please sign
the notice on the C o u n c i l
Noticeboard in the Union Lower
Lounge. We already meet on
T u e s d a y s 1p.m., above South-
side bar.
• Yours faithfully,
R . S . L . W i l k s .
IN REPLY TO N.F..
Dept. of Chemical Engineering,
Sir,
P l e a s e let me reply to the
letter from S.Brady, who wrote
on behalf of the N a t i o n a l Front
(NF) in the last i s s u e of F E L I X .
A s a foreigner I am probably l e s s
prejudiced, and as far as the
abundant use of the word
' f a s c i s m ' i s concerned as a
German I know from my family
what fascism really means.
I do not understand why the
N F does not share the res-
ponsibility which the people of
this country have from the past
and which i s widely accepted
by the majority of the B r i t i s h
people.
A s a matter of fact most of
the coloured people in this
country are B r i t i s h as a con-
sequence of the p a s t and the
advice to 'go home where they
come from' is not only inhuman
but a l s o might probably be a
sign of i l l e g a l i t y .
Since the N F does not
accept any coloured people into
its membership, why does it not
go further and accept only those
who can trace back their family
to William the Conqueror or,
better s t i l l , Alfred the Great?
Nevertheless, one can find a
s i m i l a r pattern of p o l i c i e s i n
various countries, e.g. in
Switzerland, (where Schwar-
zenbach tried to reduce the
number of foreign workers); and
in Germany, (with the National
democratic party, at present
fortunately almost disintegrated).
A l l these movements are
certainly not ' f a s c i s t ' but the
p s y c h o l o g i c a l background i s
similar.
Sure, the integration of
members of society who are not

Imperial C o l l e g e hope to be
playing the New University of
Ulster in a University Challenge
match to be recorded in
Manchester on Wednesday 5th,
February 1975. T h i s appear-
ance w i l l net ICU the sum of
£100 and £100 for each
subsequent appearances (i.e.,
if they win).
The team that w i l l be
carrying our hopes is made up
of Tom Stevenson, Chem P G ;
Keith Sugden, Astronomy P G ;
Robert D a v i e s , Maths III; and
due to a l a s t minute dropout,
Martin Turner, Bot III. Martin
a l s o w i s h e s it to be known that
the television companies are
laying on a free coach to take
supporters (approximately 40 In
number) to the match. The
coach w i l l leave B e i t A r c h at
1.00p.m. for Manchester where
there w i l l be a party (i.e. lots of
nosh and booze) for the team
and supporters. The coach w i l l
leave Manchester at 22.00p.m.
and w i l l not arrive back in
London t i l l after midnight.
A l l those who w i s h to go on
the trip please send your name
and department to Martin
