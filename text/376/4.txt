P R E C I ! P 3 C E
In my last P r e c i P i c e (two weeks ago,
s i n c e the last F E L I X was bedevilled by
printing difficulties) I spent a lot of
space explaining the need for a cam-
paign against the cuts in educational
spending, and showing that this was
inseparable from the Grants Campaign.
I think that this week's news shows
quite accurately what the future holds,
particularly for students in IC.
The Science Research C o u n c i l has
decided to offer 35% less postgraduate
awards than in 1974. The c l a i m Is that
there were not enough a p p l i c a n t s
qualified last year to take up a l l the
awards offered; I am sure that we a l l
know people with upper seconds who did
not get awards. The facts are that the
s c r e w s are being put on the S R C , and
they are in turn squeezing students.
What is alarming to me is that most
of the cuts are coming in awards offered
for engineering research. How many
Guildsmen are going to be disappointed?
The obvious result of this will be to
drive research students into the arms of
industry, with a number of firms trying to
tie students to contracts and to direct
the postgraduate's research.
It is not a pretty picture for final-year
students. T h i s is why the cuts must be
fought with a l l the strength that students
c a n muster. It is in the interests of a l l
others, lecturers and ancillar y staff
included, to support us. If the students
go - then so w i l l the jobs.
The National Grants/Cuts Cam-
paign culminates in A Week of
Action at the end of February. The
National Demonstration is on Feb-
ruary 28th. It is crucial that students
support the activities of that week.
Some people are not aware of the
c l a i m s of the Campaign. I hope to write
a short article for F E L I X each week,
which w i l l cover an aspect of the
campaign. It is important that people
read them, they are relevant to you and
your future.
Two-Year Terms?
There has been much d i s c u s s i o n
over the role of sabbatical officers
recently. One of the problems which
much be faced Is the lack of continuity
in the sabbatical posts, s i n c e a new set
is elected annually. It is in our c o n -
stitution that no-one should be able to
take more than one sabbatical year.
T h i s is one provision the ethos of which
I very strongly support; that i s , we
should not a l l o w the Union to be run by
'professional students'.
On the other hand, a reality that must
be faced is that by the time the P r e s -
ident, for instance, has come to grips
with his job, and begun to understand it
properly, it is almost time for him to go.
T h i s state of affairs is clearly no good
to the U n i o n .
The Executive has discussed this
problem many times. A possible solution
that we see, is to change the con-
stitution to allow a sabbatical officer to
stand for a second term of office.
Clearly, if the Union did not want him,
it would reject him. Furthermore, it
would provide an added incentive for
sabbatical officers to get things done
(though I don't think they usually need
it, since in order to survive one has to
be committed to the job.
T h i s is not floated out of self-
interest; it is too late to be of any use
to this year's officers. But it is worth a
debate, and it may be of definite benefit
to the U n i o n .
Weeks Hall
The E x e c u t i v e has decided to accept
the Governing B o d y ' s d e c i s i o n on Weeks
H a l l that it must remain empty until a l l
risk is eliminated. However, I have three
questions to a s k of the C o l l e g e :
* It Weeks Hall is in danger of col-
lapsing, and cannot be occupied
(legally) by students, why is the
Warden of Weeks Hall living on the
top floor?
' The Warden receives an entertain-
ments allowance of £1.50 per student
p.a. To what purpose is the £60-plus
from the Autumn and Spring Terms
being put, since there have been no
students to entertain?
" Is it true that there are students
living in Weeks, and if so, why is the
floor that they live on (presumably
sate) not filled with students?
I asked these questions at the
F i n a n c e Committee of the Student
R e s i d e n c e and got no answers. Why? If
none are forthcoming the Union must
reconsider its position on Weeks very
urgently, as students are being deprived
ot their own accommodation.
T r e v o r P h i l l i p s
Voluntary Levy
T h i s is my last try at explaining it.
Tnose students who knew about the 35p
levy thought it was a levy (paid on top of
the weeKly rent) that goes towards new
buildings. We discovered mat this is not
the c a s e . It is in fact part ot tne rent
which is siphoned off for new buildings.
We asked for it to be discontinued for
two main reasons:
1. The fund w i l l never build up fast
enough to provide a significant
number of new places. It was orig-
inally envisaged that it would build
a new hall of residence. C o s t s shot
and the project was abandoned. The
money c o l l e c t e d over four years
eventually helped to buy 14 Queens-
berry P l a c e . On average the levy
gave an extra five places per year.
2. It is more important, in the present
economic climate, that that 35p helps
pay the cost of running the H a l l s ,
and keeping them in shape; the H a l l
accounts are already under tremendous
strain, plus the £13,000p.a. which
this change w i l l give to the H a l l s
should be of c r u c i a l significance.
In my view, it is not students'
responsibility to provide new halls; the
Government gives us a 'maintenance
grant', to meet our bills, and it is for
that purpose that it should be used.
