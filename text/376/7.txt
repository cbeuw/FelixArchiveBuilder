Thefts on the campus of College equipment and
students private property such as cash, wallets, clothing
etc. have increased in recent months.
All students and staff are asked to co-operate fully
by promptly reporting to the Security Officer details of
such losses and, what is equally important, to telephone
the Security Office immediately they see any person
acting suspiciously. Many of these thefts occur during
normal working hours and the persons most likely to see
anything untoward happening are those students and
members of staff who are constantly about in their own
buildings. A polite 'Can I help you' to a stranger may
be the means of assisting a geniune visitor or it might
provoke a reaction which would indicate that the person
is up to no good.
Recent occurrences in the College suggest that
illicit keys, either 'home-made' ones or other improperly
obtained are still circulating. Whilst the manufacture
and retention of such keys may not have been motivated
by any criminal intent, their very existence does a great
deal to undermine security in the College. Persons still
in possession of such keys are asked to forward them
(anonymously if need be) to the Security Officer at once.
If you leave your pedal cycle on College premises
please ensure that it secured with a stout chain and
good padlock. Don't forget to insure it and retain details
of the serial number.
Frequently, document files containing lecture notes
bearing no details of their owners are handed in at the
Security Office, Some of them are never claimed though
no doubt worried students are still searching for them.
A name on the file would prevent a lot of worry.
A.D.Dawson,
Security Officer.
C h a r l e s L o u i s s o n
A F E W weeks ago a cassette arrived in the F E L I X office,
which the Editor asked me to review and I thought, it must be my
lucky day, something new to listen to. Unfortunately I should have
read my stars that morning ' c o s they said that I w a s going to
get lumbered and I d i d !
The title of the cassette is
'Unwillingly to School' produced
by a n outfit c a l l e d Seminar
C a s s e t t e s , who purport to pro-
duce tapes on subjects ot
'International concern' (their
words not mine), and it contains
a long and fairly boringly
structured explanation of the
educational systems in America,
France and R u s s i a , suppler
mented by a brief d i s c u s s i o n
on the flexibility of curricula
within s c h o o l s , the exam
system and the status of
teachers. T h e subjects are
d i s c u s s e d almost totally with
reference to primary and s e c -
ondary education, and introduce
no earth-shattering information
with the possible exception of a
western-biased view of the
Soviet education system.
However the section on the
status of teachers leads to an
important subject with rel-
evance to IC and undergraduates
in particular, and that is the
standard of lecturing within the
college. T h e current view of
academics i s that the standard
of undergraduate achievement
is lessening a s years go by.
Perhaps that—is true, perhaps
not, but if it i s , how much of "trie
erosion i s due to students, and
how much i s d u e to inade-
q u a c i e s , within the teaching
staff of the college? O n e
possible, and I believe probable,
answer to the question is that,
with the increase in the quantity
and diversity of the information
to be transmitted, the lecturers,
few of whom have had a signif-
icant period of formal teacher
training, are becoming over-
whelmed by their task and
consequently less able to put
over the information s a t i s f a c t o r i l y .
T h i s i s a situation that
should not a n d must not be
tolerated e s p e c i a l l y in future.
Undergraduates represent over
6 0 % of the student body of this
cgll'ege and w e are entitled to
good lecturing. Although,
apparently, Heads of depart-
ments are now s e r i o u s l y
questioning the teaching
capability of prospective
academic staff, this w i l l not
rectify the situation for several
years to come, and it is time the
college thought s e r i o u s l y of
remedial courses for e x i s t i n g
