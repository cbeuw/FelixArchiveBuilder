T H E R A D I C A L A C T I O N group i s , according to its own words,
'a student organisation set up in response to trends within the
National Union of Students'. One of its major aims i s to dem-
ocratise N U S and make it more representative of the grass-root
student.
R A G does not propose
disaffiliation from N U S but
constructive c r i t i c i s m . R A G
wishes to prevent further
alienation of the already d i s -
i l l u s i o n e d N U S membership.

Keel University last Thursday
More On
Weeks
There i s s t i l l no develop-
ments concerning when or if
students w i l l be allowed back
into Weeks H a l l . The con-
sultants' report does not
appear to have arrived at
College as yet.
The President has addressed
three questions to the authorities:
1. If Weeks is dangerous why i s
the Warden s t i l l there? If he
has a moral right to stay
there why haven't the
students who should be
there?
2. Who are the two students
living there? If the floor they
occupy is safe, why- i s the
entire floor not occupied?
3. What i s Weeks' entertain-
ments allowance for the
Autumn term being used for;
s i n c e there are no students
in Weeks?
When questioned further
Trevor P h i l l i p s s a i d :
'There is no question of an
attack on the Warden but the fact
Andy Vallance-Owen, National
Co-Ordinator of R A G and
President of Birmingham U n i -
versity G u i l d of Students put
forward several of R A G ' s aims
and p o l i c i e s . T h e s e include:
The N U S executive should
by elected by a national secret
ballot.
Delegates to N U S confer-
ences should be elected by
campus wide secret ballot, and
instances where delegates voted
against their mandate be
prevented (in the one c a s e
where this happened the
delegates were applauded!).
The restrictions imposed by
N U S on speakers should be
eased. (The R A G is concerned
with the erosion of c i v i l liberties
in a l l fields).
The s i m p l i s t i c foreign p o l i c y
of the N U S should be reapp-
raised, (e.g. Note i s taken of the
problems of d i s s i d e n t s i n the
Soviet U n i o n — something at
present disregarded by N U S ) .
While R A G is an umbrella
organisation containing students
from a wide p o l i t i c a l spectrum,
it i s not an 'unholy alliance'
but a new group providing the
b a s i s for open debate on various
i s s u e s . .
Set up a l o c a l R a d i c a l
A c t i o n Group now!
that Weeks remains vacant is
depriving a large number of
students of accommodation
which is •their right. Whatever
the reason for leaving the hall
vacant, whqt I am questioning is
the justification for allowing a
few people into the hall whilst
denying space to 60 odd
students'.
THE BID to remove the third sabbatical from the
Editorship of FELIX at last Monday's IC Union Council
meeting failed after a 'delete all and insert' amendment
found the common line which, crystallised most Council
members' feelings on the matter.
The motion to re-allocate degenerate
motion
the s a b b a t i c a l was proposed by
Jacqui Gerrard, the H o n .
Secretary of the U n i o n , i n a
paper entitled 'A Need for
Change'. Several points were
made w h i c h outlined the need
for another sabbatical i n the
U n i o n ' s central administration
to explore the realm of finance
with a view to being far better
prepared for d i s c u s s i o n s with
College in that area. The paper
a l s o remarked on certain
aspects of F E L I X .
Mike W i l l i a m s , the E d i t o r
of F E L I X , answered most of
the points r a i s e d concerning
the newspaper and then went on
to present his own paper w h i c h
argued that without a sabbatical
a fortnightly F E L I X would
into a poor com-
munications s e r v i c e with lousy
presentation and low readership.
After the two speakers had
answered a few minor points of
c l a r i f i c a t i o n , Ron K i l l , the
Deputy President rose to present
his amendment (See C o u n c i l
H i g h l i g h t s , page 5) w h i c h
presented the case that Council
should not rush into making any
sort of far-reaching decision
without a full investigation
into the workings and the needs
of FELIX and the Union central
administration.
Mrs. Gerrard and Mr. Porter
spoke against the amendment
and M e s s r s . Parker and Mortimer
spoke for it. On the vote, the
motion was carried over-
whelmingly.
HEALTH CENTRE
INCIDENT
A R E P O R T is being prepared for the College Secretary following
an incident in which there was difficulty in contacting the Health
Centre at night.
Just after 2a.m. on Monday
morning a girl i n B e i t com-
p l a i n e d of abdominal pains. Two
male students attempted to
phone the Health Centre (using
the number stated in the college
directory: ext. 1038). However,
the c a l l was answered by a
security guard who s a i d he
could not put them through as
he was not on the college
exchange and c o u l d not help
them. He suggested B e i t
security who were however
a l s o unable to help.
The President had arrived on
the scene by this time and
walked to the Health Centre
with one of the students. They
eventually got into the Health
Centre with the help of Weeks
security. No-one was there but
on lifting the phone (ext. 1038)
to d i a l for an ambulance, the
President cut in on a con-
versation between the original
security guard and the night
sister. The guard appeared to
have discovered he d i d have
the night number. The night
sister was told the situation
and at once got dressed. On
reaching B e i t i t was found the
girl had recovered.
However, such a course of
events could have had grave
consequences and so the
President has suggested that a l l
security staff should be sent a
memorandum concerning night
c a l l s to the Health Centre.
