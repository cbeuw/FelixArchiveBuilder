FELIX
M i c h a e l W i l l i a m s
THE COMMON line was found. The
third sabbatical will remain with the
Editorship of FELIX for the next year.
FELIX is safe for the time being.
L a s t Monday's council decision can
only be described as a victory for
commonsense inasmuch that any major
decision regarding the third s a b b a t i c a l
has been deferred until a working party
has thoroughly investigated the workings
of the F E L I X Office a n d the U n i o n
Central Administration. A n y such en-
quiry, I s h a l l personally welcome for
only after prolonged d i s c u s s i o n and
dialogue i n a working party atmosphere
c a n one begin to exterminate the naive
technical misconceptions that s w i r l
around F E L I X ' s new situation l i k e a
d i s e a s e d mist.
One of the approaches open to the
enquiry would be to see w h i c h concern
(i.e. either F E L I X or the soon-to-be-
created job of Junior Treasurer) has
priority in terms of importance and so
warranted a full s a b b a t i c a l ; that would
simply and inevitably l e a d to a d i -
vergence of opinion. However,, if the
approach were to be the determination of
which area could least afford to do
without a sabbatical, then the resolution
of the matter would be more clear cut.
B e that as it may, one further aspect
of the whole affair must not go un-
broached: as in the case of the F E L I X
E d i t o r / P u b l i c i t y Officer anomaly, it was
the initiative shown by the Deputy
P r e s i d e n t w h i c h proved to be the im-
portant stepping-stone towards ultimately
resolving the matter. Ron Kill has once
again provided the means by which the
majority has expressed i t s feelings
overwhelmingly.
*
John R a n d a l l ' s letter leaves me
unmoved. The paradox so grubbily
exploited by the D a i l y E x p r e s s remains
intact:
(i) Tfce N U S does not support violence;
(ii) T h e N U S does not support the I R A ;
(iii) Some of the N U S p o l i c y on Northern
Ireland coincides with the aims of
the I R A ; but does the N U S totally
condemn the very concept of the IRA
and its aims? By premise (iii), it would
appear not, but the spirit of such a
c o n c l u s i o n appears to conflict with
premise (ii). I feel sure at some time or
other, someone must have s a i d
'Paradoxes can be construed'.
*
C a n it be the wind of change that is
rustling through the portals of ICWA?
I understand that constitutional moves
are afoot to incorporate a p o l i t i c a l
aspect into the A s s o c i a t i o n . We await
further developments.

Incidentally, Dave L e a ' s 'vicious
band of rustlers' (Council H i g h l i g h t s ,
page 5) were those who kept on r u s t l i n g
their papers.
L E T T E R S
A L E T T E R FROM
JOHN RANDALL
The President's Office,
The National Union of Students,
i Endsleigh Street,
London, WC1H ODU
10th January, 1975.
Dear Sir,
I must take exception to the
statement published in the l a s t
edition of your paper that I
took no initiative to condemn
the bombings recently per-
petrated i n Birmingham.
May 1 draw your attention to
the following remarks that I
made i n opening the N a t i o n a l
Conference of the Union on
November 29. On that occasion
I s a i d :
'There have been for some
time those who have sought to
discredit this Union by a
deliberate misrepresentation of
our policy on Ireland. In the
wake of the tragic events in
Birmingham may I make it clear
that at no time has the NUS
condoned acts of indiscriminate
terrorism, or the murder of
innocent people, be it by the
Provisional IRA, the extreme
loyalists, the SAS, or the
army. Let me repeat what was
said on behalf of the Union
after the Birmingham bombings.
As an organisation that has
campaigned for an end to
internment and for a Bill of
Civil Rights for Northern
Ireland, we condemn unres"
ervedly the bombings. They
will only serve to hinder
progress towards social justice
in the six counties. I must add
also the specific sympathy of
the Union to those Birmingham
students who were injured and
maimed in the explosions. But
in so doing I must state that our
views of condemnation for the
bombers and of sympathy for
their victims extend, as they
have always done, to those who
have lived through the hell of
the last five years in the six
counties. The best memorial
we can offer to those who have
died, be they in Belfast or
Birmingham, Deny or London,
is a continuing and unrelenting
campaign for civil liberties in
Northern Ireland.
At this time we must ask
whether the measures announced
by the Home Secretary will
assist in achieving a solution
to the problems of the six
counties. My view is that they
will not. The existence of the
Special Powers Act and the
Emergency Provisions Act in
Northern Ireland have not brought
an end to violence, nor a
political solution to the
problems. I fear that the new
police powers may be used
indiscrimately against the left
in this country, and against
those groups, such as the
official Sinn Fein, who pursue
by peaceful means the leg-
itimate political objective of a
united Ireland. The tragic
lessiort of Northern Ireland is
that we will not establish civil
liberties by accepting their
erosion'.
I am glad to learn from yornr
editorial that you are not
condemning me for this attitude
but I am somewhat disturbed to
find that it is not a p o s i t i o n you
feel able to support.
Yours sincerely,
John Randall,
President.

who were to be on this term.
However on seeing the E n t s
Sheet pushed out on the second
day I found for the fifth time
there was no one I particularly
wanted to see. Once again the
line up of acts seems to c o n s i s t
of tired and staid rock bands
with the o c c a s i o n a l American
F o l k i e (?) who seems to get
booked to appear at IC on a l l
his B r i t i s h tours. The i n c l u s i o n
of N i c o , I presume, i s to app-
ease those with slightly more
avante garde tastes, w h i c h i s
O . K . if you happen to l i k e a
single lady on stage rambling
on for an hour or so accom-
panied only by harmomium.
Certainly not everybodys cup
of tea.
However one only has to
read the music press or talk to
friends from other universities
before one realises the number
of different acts who have done
University tours over the l a s t
few months and presumably
haven't been approached by I C .
B y these I don't mean the
Y e s ' s or P i n k F l o y d ' s of this
world, who apart from being a
bit expensive aren't much above
the standard of the band booked
already, but those such as
H a t f i e l d & T h e North, Fairport
Convention, the G l i t t e r B a n d ,
1 0 c . c . etc.
Surely the atrocious l o s s e s
made at the Heavy Metal K i d s
and Chapman-Whitney-concerts
last term have sunk i n , so why
not try a bit of a change, a bit
of adventure.
Above a l l , my message to
E n t s Committee i s , c a n we have
a bit of variety i n the acts
booked ?
