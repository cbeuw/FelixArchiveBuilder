H E L L is waiting at Clapham in the pouring rain for a number

boredom.
Fortunately the world i s too
busy dropping bombshells —
explosive, inflationary, verbal
or otherwise, to become bored,
but it could happen. T h i s is why
the oldest most boring i n -
stitution of them a l l — the Male
institution — needs a w e l l -
placed k i c k to get it moving
a g a i n . T h e trouble i s men take
themselves far too s e r i o u s l y .
T h e i r attitudes with regard to
themselves, their role in society,
their lifestyle and even their
dress, have hardly changed in
the past hundred years. In fact
I think w e c a n safely s a y that
men are gradually going out of
fashion, which i s why the
conscientious male i s joining
Gay L i b . Women in comparison
are moving ahead at the rate of
knots. They now play a dual
role in society — that of mother
and breadwinner. Of course
women have been emancipated
by contraception, whereas
medical s c i e n c e seems to have
done little for the m a n . What
would be h i s reaction on d i s -

children? (Actually I have a
sneaking s u s p i c i o n that a way
has been found but i t ' s being
kept quiet).
Of course he wouldn't haVe
to suffer from s o c i a l stigmas.
If the doctor told an eighteen
year o l d that he w a s pregnant,
his last concern would be
whether he w a s married or not.
The s o c i a l stigmas would come
though, and it would be Inter-
e s t i n g to s e e if a girl would
feel obliged to marry her
pregnant boyfriend. Shotgun
weddings would assume a whole
new aspect. E x p r e s s i o n s would
have to change. 'Bun in the
oven' would probably have to be
adapted to 'He's got a little car
in the garage'. T h e day may y e t
come when hospital waiting
rooms are filled with anxious
w i v e s waiting for news of a
7lbbeautiful, bouncing B i s e x u a l —
but rest assured that I s h a l l be
the first to give up my seat to

On the s o c i a l scene w e hope to
arrange a couple of dances with
IC, a P a r i s trip is organised for
next month and/ of course the
highlight of the season w i l l be
our Dinner Dance at the H i l t o n
on F r i d a y , February 28th. A
steel band w i l l be in attendance
and the cost of a double ticket
w i l l be £8.50 (£7.00 for IF

crimination more a lack of
dough.
SEXISM A T IC!
A n o n
A N Y G I R L w h o comes to IC is going to have a hard time to
begin with — adapting to an a l l male environment isn't easy. One
is not expected to m i s s female company because there js a
popular myth that 'women don't like women' s o generally one
doesn't admit to i t . When you're starting university and living
away from home, it's quite hard
to adapt — when you're part of a
minority group i t ' s much worse.
Settling in i s n ' t s o bad for the
men, who can e a s i l y find others
to talk to, or who c a n live in
isolation. It's when you're one
in ten or even one in thirty, a s
on some engineering c o u r s e s ,
that y o u feel c o n s p i c u o u s .
Most cope with t h i s ; however,
no girl c a n properly adapt to a
male dominated society, w h i c h
assumes the female element i s
there purely for the man's
benefit. Most of the a c t i v i t i e s
at IC seem to be organised in
this w a y , a n d it takes a great
deal of self-deception to enjoy
them a n d s i m i l a r l y inter-
collegiate a c t i v i t i e s . In these
the women involved to be tee-
shirted, beer drinking, a i l - l a d s -
together types like the men they
mix w i t h . I condemn these
a c t i v i t i e s because they sum up
the total attitude towards women
at I C . We need something a lot
better for the women here,
(unless the attitudes are vastly
changed there's no point in
encouraging women to come to
IC). P l e a s e don't blame the
women by s a y i n g that they could
do something about i t . We're
in a bad position and we need
it improved. If and when some-
thing positive does happen,
perhaps then w e ' l l discover
what i t ' s like living in a mixed
community a n d not just a male
one.
I'm not s a y i n g that life i s
impossible for women at I C ,
I'm just saying that i t ' s d i f f i c u l t .
When I s e e intelligent and alert
females leaving after s i x weeks
because they can't stand it any
longer, I know how they feel.
The attitude towards women
at IC i s purely s e x i s t , a n d i t ' s
getting worse a l l the time. T h e
a c t i v i t i e s such a s the R a g
Queen, B o B e l l e a n d Queen of
J e z competitions are thoroughly
degrading and i n s u l t i n g to the
women here. Other insults are
the pictures in F E L I X with their
s i c k l y , patronising dribble on
some misguided female who's
been stupid enough to pose for
it (I thought you said, they were
intelligent and alert! - Ed).
