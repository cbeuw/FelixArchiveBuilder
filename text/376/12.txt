The 7th December, 1974,
A . D . marked the first victory
for Imperial C o l l e g e L a d i e s
B o a t C l u b in t h e U L Winter I V s .
We had four crews out, the
College Crew c o n s i s t i n g of
some of the hard-core fanatics,
and three fresher crews who had
only been rowing for about
eight weeks.
With this sort of numbers,
and our effective k i l l e r - i n s t i n c t
we felt we had to win something.
L a d i e s from a l l parts of London
assembled and the heats began.
Our B crew hadn't arrived.
T h e y ' d been seen on the train
but not since. The freshers' A
crew went out and won their
heat without too much strain.
The C crew then raced i n place
of the B crew and lost to the
R o y a l Veterinary C o l l e g e . A t
last the B crew turned up after
being lost for two hours. They
went out and won their heat.
The C o l l e g e Crew were beset
by hazards right from the start.
Our rudder stuck and a s l i d e
came off. Too much! We
demanded a re-race, but they
let us race i n the final against
the winners of the two heats.
Well, before the final I came
second i n the N o v i c e S c u l l s .
(Only two people entered
anyway). Then we raced i n the
final against R o y a l Holloway
College and a U L Scratch IV.
We left R H C way behind at the
start, but it took some time
before we overtook the U L boat
and won by a considerable
margin.
Now the fresher fours final
was a different story. Our
supposed victory was marred by
the c o l l i s i o n of the two I C fours
racing. I must say, I'd have
laughed i f they hadn't been I C
crews, but as i t was, only
replusive horror struck our
hearts as it happened. R o y a l
Veterinary C o l l e g e won.
Y e t the ignomies and quirks
of fate which the day presented
were overshadowed by our
victorious' joy as we j u s t l y
regarded ourselves as the best

go to Dave Houlbrooke who was
leading the race at one point,
and h i s double who finished the

excellent race and Mike 'What a

The first team finished the

The second team came tenth

SIDCUP
T h i s y e a r ' s trip to Sidcup was looked forward to with antic-
ipation by a l l , and s u s p i c i o n by some, after the escapades of last
season. The scene was set when the A X V dragged three players
off the street and forcibly extracted another from the student
house region.
We arrived at Sidcup a half
an hour late as has become
customary this term. The 1st

which proved fatal, for Sidcup
