The meeting opened at
6.02p.m. on Monday, 27th
January 1975. The President
introduced Mr.Carl Seaford,
the Domestic Bursar who
described what h i s job entailed.
H e a l s o outlined the history of
h i s work at C o l l e g e , w h i c h
does cover a large area.
F o l l o w i n g a short question and
answer s e s s i o n the Bursar was
thanked for attending C o u n c i l .
Matters Arising From Minutes
It appears that the B r i t i s h
C o u n c i l are preparing to make a
financial contribution to the
French T r i p .
Concerning the fire in
C o l l e g e B l o c k last term; the
D P reported that it was not
normal practice to place a fire
alarm in an area such as the
J C R in case panic was caused
when the alarm went off. There
i s a b e l l nearby that can be
heard by the bar staff who
would deal efficiently with the
situation if it arose.
No nominations have been
received for the post of
P u b l i c i t y Officer but a member
of the Union has in fact asked
to be considered for the post.
Correspondence
A letter has been received
from L e e d s University S . U .
concerning a conference on
student c o u n s e l l i n g i n B r i t i s h
U n i v e r s i t i e s . Anyone interested
should contact the Welfare
Officer.
President's Business
C o u n c i l agreed that the
President should persue further
the p o s s i b i l i t y of a student
chairman of the College
A t h l e t i c s Committee.
A t a meeting between him-
self, Mr.Stevens ( E n d s l e i g h
Insurance) and Mr.Annas
( C o l l e g e finance), the latter
asked that a r i v a l quote to
E n d s l e i g h ' s be obtained. This
was embarassing since End-
sleigh had already been
promised the business.
Weeks H a l l was mentioned
(See P r e c i P i c e , page 4).
In view of the present
economic climate, it was
considered inopportune to ask
for an increase in the capitation
fee (the per-capita amount
p a i d by l o c a l education auth-
orities to the Union).
A query was raised by the
R S M A rep. regarding a report
which mentioned ' S o c i a l
Secretaries' and ' p e r k s ' . The
S C A B chairman replied that the
few 'perks' were records but
nothing monetary. He quoted
the college doorman at E n t s '
C o n c e r t s , 'This year's Ents
Committee are the most honest
I've known'.
The President reported the
Health Centre incident (See
page 1).
C o u n c i l agreed to the
P r e s i d e n t ' s recommendation to
send a ' letter of support and a
donation of Â£10 to A l n w i c k
C o l l e g e of E d u c a t i o n which
faces closure by the Govern-
ment.

Third Sabbatical

against the motion, answering
some of the points raised i n the
Hon. See's, paper. T h e E d i t o r

which summed up by stating that
C o u n c i l should have the fullest
facts before it, before coming to
any far reaching d e c i s i o n .
The Deputy President
proposed an amendment:
Delete a l l and insert:
'We resolve that a Council
sponsored motion be put to two
UGM's create the post of a
non-sabbatical Junior Treasurer.
We further resolve to set up a
Working Party to examine the
workings of both the FELIX
Office and the Union central
administration and to report on
the options open to the Union
in the deployment of its
resourses in and between these
areas'.

amendment was carried over-
whelmingly.
