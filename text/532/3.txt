LADIES HOCKEY
If you read issue no 530 of FELIX you may
have noticed a report of the ladies hockey
team, in which I mentioned an earlier
success. "What success?" you might ask.
(Especially if you know how much success
the ladies have enjoyed in the past!) Ask
Colin! Believe me he knows. He's had two
official reports and a lot of unofficial hassle,
all of which he has chosen to ignore. Well
they say 'third time lucky', so here
goes....
On 7 October at Motspur Park, the ladies
hockey team took part in the University of
London, seven-a-side hockey tournament. In
the first round we played St Mary's College
and London Hospitals 2. Having beaten them
both 2-1 and 4-0 respectively, we went
through to the quarter-finals.
A 1-0 win over London Hospitals 1, lead us
on to play our arch rivals, Chelsea College in
the semi-finals. This game was marred by
some rather physical play by the opposition,
but our superious skills took us on to a 1-0
win. The final was a close game against
University College and it was not unitl the
dying seconds of the match that Kathy
Snook, who had scored all but two of our
goals, shot home a free hit from Shirley
Course to seal the match.
The shield was presented to Julia Towns,
our captain , by Anita White, ex-England
ladies captain and U L U selector.
Five of our players were askd to go to U L U
trials, of whom Kathy Snook, Shirley Course
and Julia Towns were subsequently chosen
for the ladies squad.
It was nice to have some support as well,
with Margret Cunningham, Mr and Mrs
Course and our reserves staying on to the
bitter (sweet!) end.
Team: Julia Towns (capt), Kathy Snook,
Carol Thomas, Fay Hood, Cathy Crossley,
A v e r i l H o r t o n , S h i r l e y C o u s e , M a r y
Harrington, Debra Mendes, Hilary Carter and
.Alison Oversby (umpire).
Just to show that this was not just a flash in

Last Wednesday the ladies played a cup
match against Chelsea 2. From the start it was
clear that Imperial were c a p a b l e of
dominating the game and they proceeded to
do so.
The forwards had most of the play and
made some good attacking moves, which left
the Chelsea defence stranded on more than
one occeasion. Some good through passes
up the left wing were beautifully dealt with by
W e n d y Slaughter. Hilary Carter was
particularly effective in the goal mouth,
scoring five goals, past a Chelsea goalkeeper
wh excelled herself, despite what the
scoreline may suggest. She dealt with
successive shots by Fay Hood from Wendy
Slaughters corner hit outs, only to see Hilary
Carter score from the rebound.
It was not until late on in the match that Fay
Hood made the score sheet when she took
the ball straight from the bully off, through all
the defence to score a very quick goal. The
other scorers were Karen Jones (two) and
Shirley Course (penalty flick).
Team: Julia Towns (capt), Debra Mendes,
Karen Jones, Fay Hood, Hilary Carter, Wendy
Slaughter, Shirley Course, Dana Clark, Alex
Burnip, Catherine Crossley, Averil Horton
and Alison Oversby (umpire).

FOLK
CLUB
At last I have decided to put pen to paper
and present you with the Folk Club article.
First a quick review of last Monday's concert
featuring Nic Jones. For the few who turned
up this was an excellent night of
entertainment provided by one of the most
popular of traditional musicians.
Nic is an accomplished performer on both
guitar and violin as well as having that natural
ability to get an audience, whatever size, to
sing along. He was supported by floorsingers
and musicians, many of whom are regulars,
who played a wide range of music from
traditional Irish folk to Don McLean.
This week, as an experiment, Folk Club will
be in the lower lounge and the bar should be
open. Our guest will be Dick Gaughan and all
singers and musicians are welcome.
Future guest will be Gay and Terry Woods
of Steeleye Span fame, Martin Simpson
(which is the Rag concert), Roaring Jelly,
Nigel Mazlyn-Jones and Dave Burland.
Admission is at present 25p for members and
50p for non-membes B U T next term it will be
30p and 60p except for the first night (Roaring
Jelly), which will be 50p and £1. Singers
Nights will still be free and floorsingers can
get in free any night.
Our Christmas Ceilidh with music by
Reeelists will be on the last Monday of term,
10 December and admission is only 40p and
75p.
One final plug: S C A B night is Saturday 17
November and we need singers and
musicians. Come to Folk Club this Monday if
you want to play.
A LETTER FROM FRANK JAMES
Dear Colin
In case you or anyone else for
that matter were concerned that
no letters have appeared from me
in the past two issues of FELIX I
thought I would write this week to
reaffirm my views on the C C U s
and to comment on aspects of the
d e b a t e w h i c h has r e c e n t l y
occurred on the role and function
of the C C U s .
It is curious to note that those
letters which disagreed with my
analysis did not attempt to answer
my fundamental criticisms of the
C C U s , ie that they possess an
inherently tribal structure that
they are anti-intellectual. They
c o n c e n t r a t e d i n s t e a d o n
attempting to argue that they did
some good work in the fields of
social, academic and sporting
affairs. In other words we have
been effectively shouting past
each other. Whether this lack of
counter argument on their part
provides further evidence for my
contentions regarding the C C U s I
shall leave for the reader to
decide. In my view it does, and
consequently for lack of evidence
to the contrary I reaffirm my views
on the tribal structure of the
C C U s .
Yours sincerely
Frank James
