After last weeks slight change of reporting
style, it's back*to 'normal' again this week (fat
chance).
IC1 vs Gainsford 5 (away) 5-4
This match was close only because a third-
team player was drafted into the team at the
eleventh hour (half-past five, actually). This
was Ian (Ware does exist) Reed, who was
actually responsible for one of the games
won. Kartik (the chubby one) Lakhani won
two game and so did C Hong (the quiet one).
The seconds were rather less fortunate, yet
again failing to trouble the divisional points
table, when losing 7-2 at home to Sarah
Siddons (she must be good....know what I
mean, eh?).
IC continued their irresistable drive for the
top, rolling over Imperial G r o u p (Tobacco)
first team, 9-0 (I bet they were fuming!)
IC4 vs Imperial G r o u p 2 (home) 8-1
Minus their captain (at home in Worksop -
great cheering, sounds of Theakston's Old P.
splashing inside dimple mugs) the fourths
played brilliantly to register a convincing
victory. Their team was Wilson, Ho and
Falcone.

IC1 vs INCO 5-4
home
With the opponents having been recently
relegated from the division above, the firsts
expected (and got) a tough match. This
match (most of which I saw) was played in a
very good spirit and saw all the first team lose
to one player for the first time this season.
However, Kartik, Pete and Hongy played well
enough to win the five matches that were
necessary.
IC2 vs G A I N S F O R D 5 4-5
away
The first point for IC 2nds, but yet another
(albeit slim) defeat. The side consisted of
Andy Tye (two wins) and the inexperienced
(but promising) first year pair of Walker and
Etheridge (one each).
IC3 vs F U L H A M 3 8-1
home
Another crushing victory (since I was
dropped the thirds haven't lost!) by Blambert,
Breed and Bhong-Tai Man. Keep it up!
IC4 v% F U L H A M 4 2-7
away
A weakened side (due to absence, illness and
bad play) lost convincinhly to Fulham, but we
will win the return match!!

O n Saturday, the pot luck doubles snooker
tournament took place. There was a poor turn
out of only twelve people so the tournament
started in the quarterfinals. After a good
twenty-four break by the immortal Sanjit
'Flukey' Teelock, he and Martin 'Casanova'
Proudlove forged their way to the final where
they met me and Shaun Armstrong, who was
r u n n e r - u p in t h e freshers k n o c k - o u t
competition. Having watched Geoff Kegmer
try to get five snookers on the pink in the
previous match, we entered the final half
asleep, where Teelock and Proudlove talked
themselves to victory, beating us two frames
to nil.
A n d now for something completely the
same....Anyone wishing to have lessons,
either beginners or moreadvanceders,
should come to the snooker room and sign
on. Lessons are on Monday at 5:30.
Finally, for the sale of the century; we have
green baize (ex-snooker cloth) for sale at a
ridiculous knock-down price of fifty pence
per square foot. Enquire in the snooker
lounge now to avoid disappointment.

IC TENPIN
BOWLING
CLUB
After a slow start to the season the Tenpin
Bowling Club has commenced bowling the
club trios league at Tolworth on Wednesday
afternoons. The league, being a handicap
league, is comprised os the full range of
bowling talent from beginner upwards.
F o r t h c o m i n g e v e n t s i n c l u d e i n t e r -
university matches against Southampton and
Brunei within the next few weeks. The club
will supply many of the members of the
London University team to compete in these
matches.
A list of inter-university fixtures and the
dates of tournaments hosted by other
universities throughout Britain, is being sent
to club members soon. We hope to send
s t r o n g c o n t i g e n t s to most of these
tournaments.
The Wednesday league is settling down to
steady bowling; scores of note to date include
a 604 series by Danny Lau and several
200plus games. New bowlers and new teams
are still welcome, so if you're keen to have a
go, join us at 2:30pm on Wednesday
afternoon outside the entrance to Aero Eng
(opposite Beit Archway) where we board the
coach to Tolworth.

Despite the non-appearance of the
promised minibus, ten members of I C O C
travelled fifty miles to compete in an event in
Angley Woods, Kent.
After the wide open spaces.of Hampstead
Heath, this was a sharp contrast. Even those
areas on the map marked as runnable were
composed of young trees, six foot high
braken and brambles. Consequently times
for all courses were relatively slow, a fact not
helped by the high number of controls per
kilometre.
Members of I C O C met with varied success
with Alan Parker running well on the longest
course as did Andrew Brittain. However at the
other extreme, was Andy Maynard who didn't
copy down one of his checkpoints and spent
forty-five minutes returningtothestarttofind
out where it was.
Next Sunday's trip will be to Thornton Park
and -Hart's Wood in Essex. Anybody
interested in going, or finding out more about
the sport should come to the senior c o m m o n
room in the union building between 12:30 and
13:30hrs today.

On Sunday the club travelled with eight
people to the Havering O C C l u b event at
Thorndon Park near Brentwood. The area of
r u n n a b l e m i x e d w o o d l a n d , p r o v i d e d
reasonably demanding courses, although
they were perhaps a little over generous with
the number of controls. Performances on the
'A' course, which the majority of people ran,
were mixed with times varying between fifty-
six and one hundred and twenty minutes.
Steve Kirk put in the fastest time, beating a
member of the British Senior Squad - we
think! Ken Warren, club stalwart, had a "crud
run"; perhaps he was worrying about a
potential visit from the fraud squad? Other
performances came from Andy Maynard, Ian
Metcalfe and Alun Griffiths in M17.
The club would still welcome new
members, come along and try a day in the
country and perhaps you'll be bitten by the
bug. The club meets informally every Friday
at 12:30 in the Union Senior C o m m o n Room
on level 1. All events provide courses to suit
everyones needs so the offer isn't open to
only the fit and athletic!
