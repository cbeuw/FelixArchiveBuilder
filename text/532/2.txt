"DEMOCRACY MEANS
ALLOWING EVERYONE
TO HAVE THEIR SAY"
Dear S ;
'
Malcolm Brain's letter in last
week's FELIX, about the last UGM
has fi nally d; iven me to put pen to
paper.
Mr Brain's appalling excuses for
moving that my amendment
should not be put must be refuted.
He claims his procedural motion
was not undemocratic, yet the
convention is for the chairman to
reject such procedural motions
(unless there is a good reason to
not do so). I remember Mr Brain,
as last year's UGM chairman,
rejecting such procedural
motions (quite rightly). However,
Mick Berry, the chairman, was
quick to accept the procedural
motion. I shall come to Mr Berry's
actions at the UGM later.
Mr Brain claims there was
insufficient time to discuss the
amendment and anyway the
procedural motion was passed by
a large majority. If, however, there
was enough time to discuss a silly
motion about occupying the
Houses of Parliament with the aid
of the BBC, then there certainly
should have been enough time to
discuss my amendment, which
was at least serious. The 'Houses
of Parliament' amendment hardly
got a s i n g l e vote, after
discusssion. How can Mr Brain
claim that his procedural motion
was not undemocratic if he
prevented any discussion on the
amendment (aided and abetted by
Mr Berry). Why don't we then vote
on everything without a single
speech, and finish the UGM
quickly. Democracy, Mr Brain, if
you don't know the meaning of the
word, means allowing everyone to
have their say. Anyway, there
were still almost four hundred
people there at 2:45, which shows
how important people felt about
the motion. So clearly there was
no worry about time.
Now for Mr Berry. After the
defeat of the third amendment, I
asked to make the final speech
against the main motion. Up to
that point no speech against the
main motion had been made. But
did Mr Berry allow this speech?
NO! He just pretended there was
nothing in standing orders about
it, and forced the meeting to the
vote. But standing orders clearly
state that there must be one
speech from each side before
taking the vote.
Certain as I was of this fact,
unfortunately I did not have my
copy of standing orders, so I
didn't have time to verify it. Mr
Berry's actions are to be deplored
and the next UGM deserves an
apology. And this from a person
who announced himself as the
most impartial person in ICU at
the first UGM.
Thus Messrs Berry and Brain
managed to railroad this stupid
and worthless o c c u p a t i o n
through the U G M , stifling
opposition where they could. All
very 'democratic' Mr Brain?

"LET THE MUGS DO IT99
Dear No-longer-acting Editor (if I
may now refer to you as that)
Regarding the correspondence
on the Rag Mag. Although I voted
at the recent UGM to ban this, I
should like to contribute a few
words in Steve Marshall's
defence.
Steve's error, common to Rag
Mag editors of all colleges and
years is to fail to realise the
acceptability of a certain type of
humour amongst the public.
Although you or I might find jokes
about dead babies merely
distasteful, some people might be
very upset. In short, Steve
projected his tastes onto
everyone else in the world.
But what has not been said in
FELIX is that this publication was
the result of a lot of work by Steve
Marshall and his staff, which
seems only to be appreciated by
those of us whthave worked on or
with union publications. We must
applaud and support those people
who give their time to our society
in any unselfish way - all who work
for Rag, the union officers,
Nightline, ICCAG, etc, etc. Too
many people sit on their
backsides and say, "Let the mugs
do it." Along with many of your
correspondents, I am not keen on
sit-ins; but I agreed with the
motives'of those who followed the
President's recommended course
of action. I note that four
thousand IC students were too
apathetic to even attend the
meeting. These are the people
who should be criticized in these
columns, not those who actually
did something which they thought
to be constructive.
So to Steve Marshall, the only
man who would take on the Rag
Mag and now the only one
interested in editing the Phoenix:
more power to your wrist! And to
the Union: I hope you can get a
few more people off their
backsides this year!
Yours in not too much over 200
words

ENTS STRUGGLE ON"
Dear Sir
We were very sorry to read the
comments expressed by Mike
Speight and Jim Cantle in the
FELIX edition of 26 October. It's a
pity that such sentiments have
been uttered by student members
of the college who are supposed
to support the struggle of the
ENTS committee to bring discos,
films and groups to IC, in spite of
continuous GLC opposition. We
believe that under the prevailing
climate at Imperial, we should all
be grateful that there are any gigs
at all. The very fact that there is
competition in London as is
mentioned in the letter, requires
us to pay groups London prices
and therefore charge more since
there is no additional revenue
apart from tickets. (A pub staging
a band can afford to lose on the
tickets because it overprices the
drinks - or haven't Messrs Speight
and Cantle noticed this?)
Furthermore, we would like to
remind our critics that less than
four weeks ago, we brought Jane
Aire and the Belvederes to
College, FREE, and that on 10
November, we are offering two
groups, Between Pictures and the
Martian Schoolgirls at an advance
ticket price of 75p (something
arranged before the letter was
published). We would like to finish
by saying that everyone is free
and welcome to join the
committee and actively partici-
pate in its functions. Join us first
and sack us later, if you want!
ENTS
COMMITTEE
Dear Sir
I feel I must reply to two letters
which have appeared in FELIX
recently, the arguments of which
rely on a premise which is totally
false. I am referring to the letters
from Richard Wormsley (FELIX 19
Octooer) and the reply from
Robert Wilson (FELIX 26
October). Mr Wormsley, in a
totally ridiculous statement
blatantly claims that the present
government was "elected by a
huge majority". What a complete
lie! I might remind him that at the
last election the Tory party gained
less than 45% of the votes cast.
Some huge majority! And I believe
Mr Wormsley is studying mathsl
What I think Mr Wormsley was
trying to say was that the Tory
party was given upon a plate, by a
totally unfair electoral system, a
large majority of MPs in the House
of C o m m o n s - false and
completely artificial majority
which did not accurately reflect
the true feelings of the electorate.
A reply to the above letter from
Robert Wilson falls into the same
trap. Mr Wilson states that a
mandate of any size does not
allow policies to go unquestioned.
But there is no mandate, just a
purely artificial one created by an
outdated system which is a
disgrace to the country. Only a
system using proportional
representation truly reflects the
feelings of the electorate in the
number of MPs of each party
elected.
Yours faithfully
