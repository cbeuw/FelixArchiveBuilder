ENTERTAINMENT!
The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure
There's no longer a problem when the Gang,
of Four are in town. No not the Chinese
variety but a so-called 'pop group' from
Leeds.
News travels fast and the Gang's recent ULU
Rock Against Racism event was a sell-out.
Behind them, a giant poster 'Southall Kids are
Innocent', in front an expectant gathering.
They start to play at express train speed and
accelerate from' there. How can you describe
combined perfection and ecstasy? The
building fell to the ground; an atom bomb
landed in Central London; Coronation Street
returned to the screens; World War was
declared and the solar system fell into a black
hole. We didn't even notice and wouldn't have
cared anyway. To say that the Gang are
intense, thought provoking, forceful and
brilliant is a gross understatement and almost
an insult. To compare them with anything
else would likewise degrade them.
No song stood out from the rest for special
mention, everything was there, the singles,
the album, all in one sustained barrage of
rhythm, power, excitement and potential.
Throughout the basic beat was overlayed
with machine gun guitar and vocals full of
true emotion. People in the know have even
named them the new Nolan Sisters or even
the teenage Lena Martell. What more can I
say?
Hear their debut album 'Entertainment!' and
be educated. Then go to their next concert
come educational and be really entertained.
Why make yourself so anxious
You'll give yourself an ulcer.

Getting up at 7:15am every Sunday morning is not everybody's
idea of fun - but to provide a service to residents in halls of
residence in Southside and Linstead, IC Radio presenter,
Harvey Nadin makes the effort. Harvey's show, 'Wake up With
Harvey' starts at 8am and lasts for three hours, so the records
and features need to be prepared before Saturday night. A
regular feature is Harvey's 'Nurd at Nine' - the worst record to
arrive at IC Radio in the previous week, and that's played at just
after 9am in each week's programme. So when you reach for the
radio on Sunday morning spare a thought for the man up early
to give you the best musicin London on 301m.
