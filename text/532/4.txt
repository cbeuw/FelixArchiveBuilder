Dear Colin
As a member of the thirty people
from iC that attended the T U C
march against the Corrie bill, last
Sunday, I would like to explain
why the ICU banner was taken.
It is usually an executive
decision whether the banner
should be displayed and I had to
ask Malcolm the week before if
this would be possible. He had
answered favourably.
At Council. I mentioned that IC
students would be able to march
under the banner, when Richard
Earl questioned this. After a short
discussion during which Richard
Earl and Mark Clegg both stated
that ICU had no relevent policy, a
vote was taken in which people
voted according to their own
moral views. Council completely
overrid union policy in rejecting
the claim to take the banner.
The relevent piece of policy was
passed last term (Council did not
even bother to find out what it
was), the particular clauses which
cover action against the Corrie
Bill are:
"ICU believes....2) Abortion
should be free on demand up until
the date when the foetus would be
able to survive independently of
the mother," and
"ICU instructs....2) That we
support ALRA (Abortion Law
Reform Association).
From both these statements we
must conclude that IC Union is
against the Corrie Bill, which
severly restricts the availability of
abortion; and since ALRA was on
the march and actively campaigns
against Corrie, so should ICU.
The IC contingent, on Sunday,
thus decided that Council was in
gross contravention of its role in
taking this action.
That Council made its decision
without due consideration can be
seen from the various quotes
below (which, to the best of my
knowledge, are accurate).
Mark Clegg: "I don't know as
much about it as you do, and I'm
not that bothered about it
anyway."
Richard Earl: "Abortion is a
moral issue."
Roger Stotesbury voted against
taking the banner because it was a
TUC demo and Chris Fox asked,
"Why would anyone care to take
the banner on a march anyway?"
We could therefore ask that our
executive .pay more attention to
current IC Union policy than to
certain eloquent speakers at
college committees.

Dear Sir
I feel I must reply to Mr
Waterworth's insulting letter in
last week's FELIX.
I am not a beer-swilling lout with
a large alimentary canal. I only
drink about five pints a week.
What is wrong With me urging
the Union to concern itself only
with matters of "direct concern to
the majority of students". It is,
after all, the Imperial College
Students Union and not a
philanthropic organisation. Didn't
we vote to get out of NUS because
we were worried about the time
wasted on external affairs?
Mr Waterworth, you may find my
views "depressing" but I find the
reluctance of College to provide
good accommondation and the
pooi catering one of the
depressing things about IC. When
I occasionally have a drink at
College, I find the exorbitant
prices depressing. We have the
most expensive university bars I
know of including Cambridge,
Newcastle, Durham, Shefield,
and Nottingham.
You talk about issues. I am in
favour of foreign aid and as I
stated in my previous letter I only
wish rich countries, ie countries
not receiving foreign aid, to pay
the full economic cost of
educating their citizens.
One hundred million pounds
can't be dismissed; remember the
troubled caused over the ordered
Â£2million cuts to two local health
authorities. Mr Waterworth, how
many Arabs or Malaysians do yo
see dying of malnutrition?
Perhaps when you have spent a
few more years at College you will
be more qualified to speak on the
subject.
Yours faithfully

Dear Sir
May I convey my congratulations
to you and your staff for having
the guts to print the story on page
fifteen of last week's FELIX.
I don't honestly know what ICU
hoped to achieve by the
occupation further than just a
statement of intent, and I refuse to
believe that they would be as
naive as to expect ANY type of
communication from Margaret
Thatcher or Mark Carlisle, let
alone surrenders.
If they wanted to air their/our
grievances in such a way as to
attract maximum publicity and
minimum inconvenience they
might have organised a petition
spreading, say, throughout the
University of London. A 10,000
name petition I feel would have
had a greater impact.
Congratulations again - I don't
think you've heard the last of the
comment.
Yours faithfully
John Clark

PS - Before anyone calls me a
fascist, I'd like to point out that I
do agree that indiscriminate cuts
could damage the tertiary
education sector.
Dear Mr Palmer
I am writing to you to clarify the
situation regarding the publica-
tion of my photographs in FELIX.
In 12 October's FELIX, you
published a photograph taken by
myself of the giant Tiddle and
Wink taken in Regent Street. You
stated you would give me a credit
for this picture in the issue but this
did not happen.
Further to our conversation
yesterday it appears that you
came into possession of a copy of
. the current Broadsheet cover
photograph under cirucmstances
that can only be described as
questionable. It also seems that
you were considering using this
photograph in the current issue of
FELIX. If I had not spoken to you
and this photograph had been
used I have no doubt that there
would have been no credit for it in
FELIX.
I would like to point out that I
own full copyright of both these
photographs and as such they
cannot be reproduced without my
permission. In the first instance
my permission was given subject
to the giving of a credit which did
not occur. I n the second instance I
again gave my permission for the
photograph to be used but I have
no doubt that if we had not met
yesterday the photograph might
have been used without my
permission.
In the future, if you use any
photograph of which I am the
c o p y r i g h t h o l d e r ie any
photograph that I take, since I will
not take photographs for anyone
on any basis that does not leave
me as the copyright owner;
without my prior written
permission I shall have no
hesitation intaking action against
yourself as editor of FELIX and
against FELIX for damages for
breach of copyright.
Yours sincerely

Dear C6lin
Every ardent reader of FELIX
will note that a deadline forithe
next copy is given. If one gets a
piece of literature into the FELIX
Office by this time it is very likely
to be in the next week's FELIX.
Last year I wrote a reasonable
number of sports reports and
each being delivered by the
deadline appeared in the
following FELIX.
This year as well as a new editor,
other changes seem to have
occurred. My particular grievance
is a water polo summer tour
report. Having put some effort
into writing it, I ensured that it was
presented not only to the FELIX
Office, but to you personally by
the deadline on 8 October. You
can possibly understand my
surprise when it didn't appear in
the following FELIX. I naturally
went to the FELIX Office and
enquired why my report,
admittedly not a work of literary
genius, but by no means
unprintable, had not appeared. I
was told more important news had
gone in instead and was assured it
would go into the next FELIX. Well
do you think it did? NO! I again
went to the FELIX Office and Maz
informed me that you decide what
goes in and what doesn't and it is
the job of the editor. I don't argue
with that. I am then assured that
efforts will be made to get it in the
following week. In my innocence,
I assumed it would appear.
This morning arrives and not
only is my sports report not in, but
there is not one sport report any
where. Did sport stop for a week,
perhaps in protest at the
education cuts!
As the editor I consider it your
job to balance our student paper,
to put in articles that are
informative as well as fun to read.
Sports reports may not interest
everyone, but are two fu 1
1 pages of
cartoons really necessary.
