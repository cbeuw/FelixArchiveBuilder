RED
CROSS
PRESENTATION
In 1977, the Imperial College detachment
of the Red Cross was set up to 'train in first aid
a n d n u r s i n g , e s c o r t t h e s i c k a n d
handicapped, do first aid duty at theatres,
exhibitions and sports events, prepare for
disasters and help out in hospitals'. Since
then they have taken part in most of these
activities, though fortunately, no national
disasters have occured. But mainly in
connection with helping the sick, the elderly
and the handicapped.
The IC detachment now numbers thirty
people, and in the past it has been
instrumental in training no less than one
hundred and twenty-five people in the
College in first aid and nursing. They were
also very much involved with the reception of
almost three hundred and fifty Vietnamese
boat people at Kensington Barracks in
November of last year when they provided
s o m e of t h e V A D s ( V o l u n t a r y A i d
Detachments) necessary for the first aid and
nursing services at the centre.
In his speech Lord Flowers thanked all J.he
students who were involved in the raising of
the £5,300 that was put towards buying ana
equipping the ambulance. Last year, the
remaining £2,500 coming from other funds to
which he had access. He then presented Lady
Hylton Foster, President of the London
branch of the Red Cross and the society with
the key.

RED CROSS MEMBERS GROUP
Anyone interested in giving help (BSc First Aid not necessary)
either occasionally or regularly please come along to the ICCAG
room, top floor Union building, 12:30 today or next Friday (lunch
and coffee provided).
At the moment we have several people visiting geriatric or
psychiatric wards at St Mary Abbots Hospital with which further
help is needed. Also people are needed to help with security at a
fund raising fair this Tuesday afternoon at Kensington Town Hall.
Good with children? Someone is needed to help with a Junior Red
Cross Group on Monday evenings at 6:30pm at the Kensington and
Chelsea Red Cross centre on Old Church Street. The children are
all ages up to sixteen and are said to like going out a lot. Try it for a
week or two if interested and see if its your cup of tea.
I also need a bigger pool of people for escorts accompanying old
and infirm people from London across the country making sure
they get to their destinations unharmed and not a nervous wreck.
Also there is a possibility of helping at a Handicapped Children's
Adventure Playground locally.

SPECIAL
it
PUBLICITY OFFICER
you like the prospect of designing
posters to publicize Union events, please
consider standing for publicity officer. This
post is vacant due to the resignation of Colin
Palmer. The job involves designing posters
and handouts and so would be ideal for
anyone with creativity. The papers are up for
this post now.
UNION FINANCE COMMITTEE
There is one vacancy on this committee,
that of an ordinary member, I'm sorry that it
was not possible for me to give you more
notic, but papers for this post are up, in the
Union Lower Lounge, but come down at 5pm
today.
BADGES
Yes, you've seen the IC E N T S badges, the
N A T HIST S O C badges, the S T O I C badges
haven't you? If your club or society wants
badges made then come and see me. You will
need your own artwork (35mm diameter), a
separate copy for each badge.
ENVIROMENTAL WEEK
This is soon to hit Imperial. There will be
another organising meeting at 1pm on
Monday in the Hon See's Office.
REFECTORY COMPLAINTS
You will notice that in each refectory a box
will be mounted on the wall. This is so that if
you have a complaint/suggestion about the
food/service/price/cleanliness etc y o u c a n
have a say. Any note put in one of the boxes
will be followed up a student representative
who will take it to the person responsible. I
urge you to make use of these boxes so that
our refectory organisers receive the needed
feedback.
Just one point that should be stressed. If
the complaint is with the quality of the food
you should return it to the manager, putting a
note in the box only if then you are still not
satisfied.
UGM
Yes, you 750 people who turned up to the
last one. There's another next Tuesday at
1pm in the Great Hall. Be there!
