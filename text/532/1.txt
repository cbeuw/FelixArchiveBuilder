PROBLEMS FOR FELIX
A FELIX reporter has been fined £ 2 9 5 by customs. The reporter
had been on an assignment in another country, and on his
returnhe didn't declare a camera he had purchased there. This
was a result, claimed the reporter, of his not having slept for
several days prior to his return. The camera was discovered in a
spot check, and was subsequently impounded, although several
reels of film were not.
Michael Arthur, the Union Welfare Advisor, is currently
assisting him in his efforts to get the camera back.
On a brighter note, two IC photographers have achieved
distinction, this week. The R C S photographer had one of his
photographs printed on the front page of the South Kensington
news and Chelsea Post. Colin Palmer, the Acting Editor of FELIX
is credited with a photo on page 86 of the current Radio Times.
Colin took the picture when he was working freelance with the
B B C .
Motion on Bye-Laws
A motion concerning Imperial
College bye-laws, proposed by
Richard Earl and seconded by P
Spencer-Phillips, will be heard at
the next U G M , on Tuesday 6
November.
The motion concerns the
apparent transgression of I C U
bye-laws by the Executive in
connection with the dismissal of
John Shuttleworth as Editor of
FELIX.
THE CORRIE MARCH
On Sunday there was a march
against the Corrie Bill in central
London. About 3 0 people from
Imperial College took part in the
march, 1 0 of these were men.
Some 2 2 Universities took part
from such diverse places as Bath
and Lancaster. Despite being
contrary to the vote taken at last
week's I C U Council, the Imperial
College Union banner was taken
on the march and the Exec will
discuss this topic at their next
meeting. B y the time that the
demonstartors from IC had
reached Trafalgar Square, the
main speeches had finished and
they were asked by police to go
home.

CCD OVERSPENDS BUDGET
The Department of Computing
a n d C o n t r o l h a s a l r e a d y
overspent its complete yearly
b u d g e t . T h e h e a d of t h e
department, Professor Lehman,
speaking at the department's
annual Fresher's dinner, on
Monday night, explained that
according to the U G C norms,
Computer Science is regarded as
a Mathematically based subject
and funded accordingly. T h e
C C D course is in fact heavily
laboratory based and its fiscal
needs correspond to that of an
e n g i n e e r i n g d e p a r t m e n t .
Profeesor Lehman went on to say
that if the College was to continue
to offer what is now widly
recognised as one of the best
Computer Science courses in the
country, the funding level for the
department would have to be
significantly increased, despite
the current cutbacks in education.
To obtain such an increase
would involve a hard fight, since it
entailed taking funds from other
departments. Professor Lehman
looked for the support of the
Guilds' U n i o n , i n achieving an
adequate level of funding.
OPEN MEETING
At 1pm on Wednesday about 40
people attended the occupation
meeting held in the Union Dining
Room. Chris Fox the Union
President, reported that the
occupation of the SDR had
finished and that the mock funeral
outside the Albert Hall with the
distribution of leaflets had been
successful. Following in the
footsteps of IC, UMIST have gone
into occupation over the issue of
education spending suts and were
very rapidly supported by
Manchester University who
started their own occupation.
