Water Polo? How do the players teach the horses to swim?
A
fter losing most of last
year’s players (half the
team were MSc students)
the IC ladies water polo
team had their ingers crossed for lots
of girls to turn up to the irst couple
of training sessions of the year. hey
didn’t right from the start, but after
a few weeks we got there. With two
national league players, two girls newly
transferred from swimming to water
polo, a few people who’d played before
and a good partnership with two of
the girls from the Medics water polo
team, we embarked upon our training
for this year’s BUCS competition.
At our annual tour to Germany in
November we even managed to win
a match, which had never happened
before. Extremely happy about this
great start to the season, nobody could
have known that this was only the
beginning…
After having come 3rd in our
league last year, we had stayed in the
same division, only facing UCL and
Southampton in a home – and away
league. On the 26th of January we
played the irst mini-tournament at
Ethos. In the irst match, we narrowly
managed to overtake Southampton
7-5. he match afterwards was even
tighter with us beating UCL by 7-6.
he week after, in the second mini-
tournament at a pool with two deep
ends, Southampton and UCL were
both more convincingly beaten 7-3,
meaning we’d won the league. Because
the BUCS competition structure had
changed this year, winning our league
did not mean automatic promotion to
the “Premier South” league – it merely
meant we’d qualiied for taking part
in playofs against the number 6 of
the premier league and the winner of
Western division 2.
Needless to say, we were happy to
have won the league – even though
there was so much more to come.
Alongside the league, there was a
(nationwide) knockout-path in the
ight for the Trophy. Our irst match in
the irst round of this was against UCL
at their home pool which is reasonably
deep, but narrow, so we’d lucked out.
We all put up a good ight and after
a stressful four quarters we’d beaten
UCL once again, this time by 10-6.
Onwards and upwards, our next
match in the knockout tournament
was another away ixture, against UEA
in Norwich. We had some trouble
getting our full team out and so we
turned up to Norwich with just one
substitute, only to ind that UEA had
none. It was a special match for us,
because each of our players scored at
least one goal (even the goalie, who
was swapped for a ield player in the
inal quarter just so that she could get
a goal). he inal score? 25-2 to us,
which meant we’d made it through
the irst two rounds of the Trophy
championship, qualifying for the
semiinals.
In the semiinals we met
Southampton once again, alongside
UWE and Warwick. We thought the
latter was going to be our strongest
opponent, as did coach Adam who
got stuck elsewhere in the country
and ended up missing the irst match
of the tournament. hankfully this
year we were blessed with a second
coach, and so after the necessary
amounts of shouting from coach
Joe’s side we managed to win from
Southampton a third time with the
inal score coming to 7-5. his didn’t
ill us with conidence, but all worries
were unfounded as the game ended in
a smashing 13-4 win for us. he last
semiinal game against UWE, who
were playing in BUCS for the irst
time this year and as such had a fair
number of players who barely knew
how to pick up a ball, was a real breeze
with us obliterating them in a 16-2
game. he three wins meant we’d won
the semiinals and so we’d qualiied for
the Trophy inals, which were to take
place during Trophy Tuesday. At the
time of playing this day was only 10
days away, but there was hardly any
time to celebrate, because our playof
ixtures against Bath (bottom of
Premier South) and Gloucestershire
university (top of Western division 2)
were just around the corner.
BUCS had randomly assigned our
home playof ixture to be against
Gloucestershire and our away ixture
to be against Bath, with some random
playing dates that in water polo
nobody adheres to. Except for the
University of Bath – who insisted we
play them on a Wednesday that we
could only make with exactly enough
players for a team. Substituteless,
we skived of class and work and got
on a train to Bath. hey were clearly
expecting to claim an easy victory
over our 7-woman team, asking us
to rate ourselves against some of the
IC Water Polo: Review of the Year
other teams they’d played before while
we were getting changed for the game.
It, therefore, didn’t come as a surprise
that their captain refused to shake
our hands after losing to us 18-5, with
Sophie scoring more goals by herself
(7) than Bath did in total.
he next playof game against
Gloucestershire saw us turning up
with one substitute. We had clearly
done so before, but after having played
10 matches in 9 weeks we were all
getting a little tired. In what felt like
a very stressful match we comfortably
hammered them 12-5, thus gaining
us promotion to the Premier South
league for next year. his amazing
result did not quite sink in, as our last
match, the inal of the Trophy against
Liverpool, was just days away.
On the 25th of March, we all headed
down to Guildford for “Trophy
Tuesday”. With support from Paula
and Jackson representing the club,
Hannah, Anthony and Neil from
Sport Imperial, and Klara’s and Jo’s
mothers we embarked upon this last
task of beating Liverpool. We knew it
wasn’t going to be easy, although a day
or so before the match we found out
that we were the only ones in division
2 who had so far remained unbeaten
– Liverpool had lost one game during
the league stages at the beginning of
the season.
he match started of with all of us
feeling very nervous, and as a result
making a good few mistakes. Each
team scored alternately and by half
time we were 2-1 down. he third
quarter saw similarly tight scores,
but in the last half of the fourth
quarter we managed to score 4 goals
in a row, putting us to an 8-5 lead
that eventually culminated in a 10-6
win to us, securing that hard earned
gold medal to end what has been an
amazing season of 12 matches, 139
goals (and 52 conceded, but we’ll
ignore that), no lost games, lots of
travelling and amazing performances
from everyone. And with that, I
think it’s safe to say we’re all very
much looking forward to take on the
opponents in the premier league next
year!

On Wednesday 28th May, Imperial
1st XI travelled to Chichester to
play their 1st XI in a BUCS ixture.
Chichester were top of our league
with 3 wins from 3, so we went into
this game determined to get a good
result. We got of to the perfect start
by missing our train to Chichester,
but were soon back on track (excuse
the pun) and raring to go.
Upon arrival, it seemed God had
decided to take a lavatory break and
interrupt proceedings as the ground
was softer than Viggy’s excuse for
being late. Nevertheless, looking
forward to taking advantage of the
wet conditions and bowling irst,
we were promptly informed that we
were indeed batting.
Juhin and Lomas opened up for
Imperial and batted solidly – a 50 run
opening stand, with some beautiful
shots down the ground from Juhin
in particular. Unfortunately their left
arm spinner managed to turn one in
the end, bowling Juhin for 18.
Enter the Mohit. Having banged
on for the past few weeks in these
incisive journalistic masterpieces
about the IC 1st XI batsmen batting
as if they’ve had their arms removed,
our very own Rahul Dravid, set up
(corner) shop and anchored the
innings by building partnerships
with Lomas and Jayanth (after
Lomas was caught for 25). Having
negotiated a very tricky period
with a moving ball, and with the
score at 117-2 of 30 overs, Jayanth
decided to turn militant and started
launching the ball to all parts of the
ground bringing up another ine 50,
after which the opposition’s token
ginger was heard remarking “that
was the worst 50 I’ve ever seen...” (he
conceded 14 runs of his next over...
Just saying).
Whilst Jayanth was batting like
a crack addict, Vishal was calmly
building his innings, ready to set
of some ireworks near the end.
Jayanth was soon caught for what,
in all seriousness, was a match
deining knock of 58, which meant
that last week’s hero, the magician,
the entertainer, the captain himself,
Viggy Venkateswaren strode to the
wicket and got ready to face his
irst delivery. Rumour has it that
Viggy had recently acquired tickets
to see ‘One Direction’ (his favourite
boyband) in London, and indeed
there was only “One Direction” he
was heading, when he was out LBW
for a golden duck - walking back to
the pavilion. I personally thought it
was a quacking knock.
Imperial’s best looking cricketer
then walked out to bat, looking to
make an impact with the bat before
he takes an exam break from cricket.
Together Zain and Vishal saw
Imperial past 200, until Vishal holed
out to deep square leg (he hasn’t
been to the gym much recently) for
a well made 41. Zain then ran Nick
out without facing a ball, and Dave
proved to us that Karma does in fact
exist, as he ran Zain out soon after.
Whilst an asthmatic sloth could have
run better than those two, Imperial
inished on a steady 212 -8 of 50
overs, a more than competitive score
on a horrible wicket.
Correct me if I’m wrong (Arvind
I’mlookingatyou)butanephropathy
is deined as a disease of the kidney,
similarly a neuropathy is a disease of
the nervous system.
Well it seemed that Chichester
were sufering from a Ganapathy,
because Jayanth opened the bowling
and was all over them like a rash,
picking up 3 early wickets for just
17 runs of his 7 overs. Similarly
Simon kept the pressure on bowling
10 overs for 28 runs. he notorious
V.I.G. (gy) then picked up 3 for 18
to send Chichester on their way, as
IC 1st XI beat Chichester 1st XI by
102 runs.
Imperial – 212-8. Chichester –
110 all out.
Aside from the landslide victory,
there was a fair amount of “chat”
between the two teams during
the match, which culminated in
Chichester refusing to change the
scoreboard, and then placing a
“caution wet loor” sign near the
boundary where a couple of our
ielders had slipped.
We promptly shook hands, and
left for London, but not after Jayanth
had the last laugh (see picture).
Imperial have now got two out of
three wins, and can be considered
real title contenders this season.
