Topping Out the Halls at North Acton
he RCSU UROP bursary has been
awarded to an undergraduate student
from the Department of Chemistry.
his is a new initiative where the
funding will be from the RCSU
for students from lower income
backgrounds.
Plabon Saha commented: “We also
understand that one bursary might
not make a huge diference but this
is seen as a symbolic gesture that
we hope will encourage the faculty
to look into this issue and increase
funding. We also hope that some
provision can be set up for students
from lower income backgrounds to
undertake UROP placements. In the
future, it was decided that the RCSU
will look towards pitching the idea of
an UROP Bursary to our sponsors and
hopefully replicate the BP awards that
currently exist in Engineering.”
he student receiving the funding
said: “I was delighted when I received
the news that I had been awarded the
RCSU UROP bursary. Without it, my
summer project may not have been
able to go ahead. Bursaries such as
these go a very long way in ensuring
nobody is denied a valuable research
opportunity purely on inancial
grounds and therefore allow the
recipient to gain essential research
experience without having to worry
about how living costs are going to
be met. I strongly recommend to
anybody taking part in a summer
project worried about the inancial
side apply for a UROP bursary - it
really does help!”
RCSU President Plabon Saha
said, ““UROP represents a great
opportunity for students to explore a
career in research. It plays a vital role
in encouraging students into scientiic
careers and I believe more should
be done to encourage students into
science careers. I hope the steps the
RCSU has taken this year is the start
of a new push towards encouraging
more UROP opportunities and
increase funding for this programme.
I am glad I played a role in this.””

an exploration of the legal barriers
to entry to the energy markets. By
acquiring a large amount of electricity
from lots of individual suppliers
the team should be able to play a
substantial role in the electricity
market.
he team plans to develop their web
presence and liaise with the Greater
London Authority and the Mayor’s
oice in the coming months, with a
hope to begin in the new year.
£5000 of the £20,000 prize went to
Kirsty Kenney and Harold Craston
(SolarBox) from LSE who plan to turn
unused telephone boxes in London
into public phone charging outlets
powered by solar panels.
Blocks, created by Imperial students
Omer El Fakir, Serge Vasylechko,
Alireza Tahmaseb Zadeh, Karl
Taylor, Hakeem Javaid and Andrey
Antyufeev, was also shortlisted for the
award. he team devised the concept
of a modular smartwatch (as reviewed
by Felix in March) that can evolve to
meet the changing expectations of
consumers.
Meanwhile, Dr. Michele Serri
(Materials) and Physics PhD
student from Imperial were also in
the shortlist. heir idea, Light-Fi,
“integrates the lighting infrastructure
to the intranet within an oice to fully
automate the lighting environment.
he automation will be able to turn
of lights when all colleagues have left
the oice for the night, thereby saving
energy.”
Another Imperial group, the Energy
Defenders formulated their idea
due to a desire to “inspire the next
generation, the way in which the road
safety hedgehog did, but for reducing
carbon emissions”. he team is formed
of 3rd year Aeronautical engineers
Emma Dixon, Madeleine Alexander,
Oliver Bauer, Ravina Bains and 3rd
year Mechanical engineers Jonathan
Crawford, Mo Alemohammed, Ewan
Armstrong.
hey started the idea at the start of
the year and are hoping to continue
after graduation. Hoping to market
the concept to children, parents,
teachers and government, the team
are “a system of services developed
around a brand, the Energy Defenders”.
he brand will “create interest in
energy saving, through activity days,
interactive apps, engaging websites...
and an animated cartoon series”.
