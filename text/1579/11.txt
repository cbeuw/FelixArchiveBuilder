FRIDAY 06 JUN
MUSIC
T
wo years ago I wrote a
review that examined three
of the excellent releases
by Oren Ambarchi in
2012; Audience of One,
Imikuzushi (with Keiji Haino and
Jim O’Rourke), and In the Mouth –
A Hand (with Fire!). he guitarist,
drummer, and electroacoustic
improviser who started his career as a
Jazz drummer in his native Australia
has since continued in the same vein.
Numerous other releases have since
come out, including the excellent
Connected, a collaborative efort with
Robin Fox which was commisioned
as a soundtrack for a dance piece.
Ambarchi’s music touches on
ambient, jazz, rock, krautrock, and, of
course, noise.
He has a long history of collaborating
with some of the most accomplished
artists in experimental music (see the
names dropped above or last year’s
collaboration with Japanese legend
Merzbow for a few examples).
Two years later, I find myself once
again staring down the barrel of a
review of another impressive trio of
albums, this time all collaborative
efforts.
Tikkun (Above, left) is a
collaborative effort with the
hugely influential Richard Pinhas.
Pinhas, a Frenchman, is the man
behind influential space rock group
Heldon. Since then, he’s continued
to release excellent work under his
own name, dabbling in tape loops
and delays, collaborating with
many noise musicians and making
music which, for my money, stands
somewhere between Heldon’s
sound, which had so much influence
on industrial music, and something
Oren Ambarchi: Two Years On
more raw and experimental. This
is hardly a surprise, I suppose, due
to Pinhas’ work being intertwined
with some of the biggest names in
noise, for example 2010’s Metal/
Crystal, which featured both
Merzbow and Wolf Eyes, who are
the biggest name in US noise.
Like Metal/Crystal, the six tracks
of which sprawl over a two hour
double disc feature, Tikkun consists
of three jams, two of which are over
twenty minutes, with the other
clocking in at fifteen. It’s hard not
to look at the album as anything
other than kindred spirits working
together. Both musicians have
similar approaches to collaboration
and sounds which blend together
seamlessly, with the mind altering
kaliedoscopic sounds of space rock
and exploratory forays into noise
and ambient complementing each
other.
Both artists’ work has featured
elements of both of these at one
time or another.
To my ear, the album immediately
seemed more focused and well
constructed than Crystal/Metal
and one of the first things I noticed
was the distinctive drumming style
of Joe Talia (interviewed in Felix
last year), which has been a fixture
in Ambarchi’s live shows and many
studio works for the last few years.
His drumming style is incredibly
well suited to this work and really
drives it along, one example when
the drums join in with some
classic Ambarchi guitar work at
the beginning of ‘San Francisco -
T2V2’.
The aforementioned guitar work
is of course Ambarchi’s favoured
scratchy abrasive tone, although
the word tone may not be the best
to describe the abrasive atonality of
Ambarchi’s guitar assaults. Other
than these elements and, of course,
the classic Pinhas sound, it’s hard
to pick out distinct elements and
attribute them to
sources. It should be
noted that Merzbow
is also involved,
contributing some
electronics to
the amorphous
cacophony this
excellent effort often
creates.
Shade Themes from
Kairos, released on
Drag City on May
27th sees Ambarchi
working with
Stephen O’Malley
(of Sunn O))) fame)
and producer and
Master Musicians
of Bukkake founder
Randall Dunn.
The album was
intended as a score
for Kairos, a film by
Belgian filmmaker
Alexis Destoop. In a
sense it’s hard to review the album
without watching the film, but the
album presents an eerie foreboding
sense that all isn’t quite well from
the start. Opening track ‘That
Space Between’. comes across like
Neurosis style dirge, but expansive
rather than claustrophobic and
more acoustic than metallic, before
some melodic chimes add a sense
of comfort to the piece. ‘Temporal,
Eponymous’ starts off similarly and
gradually evolves pretty formidable
jam, as a wide array of instruments
are added to the mix.
While these tracks are all very well
and good, I’m sure I wasn’t alone in
wondering at this point where the
drone and experimentalism was.
It need not be mentioned to any
Sunn O))) or Ambarchi fans that
the nature of the artists’ work often
involves a more abstract take on
music and this is somewhat realised
on ‘Circumstances of Faith,’
which opens with five minutes of
restrained feedback and drones
which creep along menacingly until
they are punctuated by a rousing
drum beat and bassline.
The mellow and relaxing
‘Sometimes’ adds to the meditative
aspect to the album with its use
of acoustic instrumentation and
persistent rhythms. “Sometimes”
has a very static quality to it, and
a comforting melody is acheived
with vocals from Japanese singer-
songwriter Ai Aso. The final track
on the album, ‘Ebony Pagoda’, is the
twenty minute culmination of the
album.
It certainly satisfies any hunger
for drone that may have built up
over the course of the album (it
certainly did for me). Waves of
contrasting drones, sounding at
times disconcerting and harsh,
and at other times melodic and
comforting give the track a sort
of cleansing feeling which is a
perfect way to close the album.
Certainly this track will satisfy any
drone cravings and comprises a
rather exhausting musical journey,
tossed one way and another by the
interplay of diverse droning sounds.
Overall, the album is great at
creating a meditative yet sinister
atmosphere, but admittedly, the
album could be even more varied
and, for my money, misses the
explosive outburst of noise driven
energy which would really send it
over the top.
Fifteen minute EP Stacte Karaoke
is definitely the biggest surprise
of the lot. An initial listen had me
scrambling to the internet in an
attempt to confirm that this was
actually a new Ambarchi release
and not some elaborate hoax.
Further inspection revealed, much
to my surprise, that the album’s
classic rock n’roll boogie feel is due
to a rhythm section comprised of
famously bearded Southern rockers
ZZ Top. I have to admit that this
wasn’t a collaboration I could have
foreseen at the start of the year.
As far as I can tell, opener ‘Milk
a Cow with a Monkey Wrench’ is
more or less a classic 12-bar blues
pattern and, similarly, the second
track ‘Park It Where the Sun Don’t
Shine’ is based on a repetitive catchy
riff. In both cases, we are treated to
explosive shredding blasts from the
aforementioned cathartic guitar
tone and other extra layers from
Ambarchi.
While Ambarchi’s Black Truffle
label is often home to some of his
most experimental work, what
makes this EP stand out is the
element of whimsy and humour
surrounding the work, a rare
moment of frivolity and simple rock
in experimental music.
Beyond that, however, it’s simply
relentlessly catchy and the short
length makes it hard to avoid
repeatedly playing these two great
tracks.
