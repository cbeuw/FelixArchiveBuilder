Student in
Health
Centre after
Southside
meal!
A n I C student, A b i d A l i Dost, a
Chemistry P G , received a cut lip
on Tuesday evening while eating
a meal i n the Southside Refec-
tory.
He had been eating Pizza rice
and salad i n the m a i n Southside
D i n i n g R o o m , when he cut the
inside of his lip on a piece of glass
approximately one centimetre
long. T h e glass came from his
meal, so he went back to the
serving point with two friends.
W h e n he complained, he was
told that a bowl containing the
salad was chipped, a n d it was
thought that the glass came from
there. M r Dost was taken to the
H e a l t h C e n t r e at 6 : 0 0 p m f o r
medical attention.
M r Dost told F E L I X that he
t h o u g h t i t s t r a n g e t h a t t h e
Southside staff should know of
such a hazardous bowl, as they
could identify it immediately,
but still serve from it. H e added
that the way the matter had been
dealt with i n Southside made it
appear that such events were an
everyday occurance.
O n r e t u r n i n g to S o u t h s i d e
later, the offending bowl was still
being used to serve salads from,
and it was not removed, until a
further complaint was made.
W h e n F E L I X telephoned M r
Mooney, he said that he knew
nothing about the affair, as it had
not been reported to h i m . W h e n
he was asked about the chipped
salad bowl, he replied that it was
only hearsay, a n d he would not
comment o n it.
ETHER PAD ATTACK!
A young woman was attacked last Saturday night as she walked home to her flat In Princes
Gate Mews behind Southside. Her assailant, a man In his early forties, seized her from behind
and held a pad soaked In ether against her face. Luckily she was able to fight off the man, who
fled Into the darkness.
The girl, who is the niece of an
Imperial College lecturer, was
End of World
Smash Hit
ON TUESDAY, JANUARY 20, the world did not come to an end.
The JCR was not even wrecked, which is usually inevitable after
JCR parties. The party was a fancy dress affair, the idea being
that the participants should come as they would never have
dared were it not for the promised holocaust. One would think
most people would never have dared to go in jeans and T-shirts
bearing such varied motifs as 'RCS Union', 'Imperial College', and
'Hi, I'm boring, what's your excuse?', but they did, so one
supposes that's OK.
Some people did honour the spirit of the occasion as witnessed
by the above photograph. Left to right is the FELIX cow gum
monitor, Steve Goulder, as Ali-Baba (it was supposed to be
Ayotollah Khomeini), Editor of The Phoenix, Sean Gib/in, in a
cute pair ofgfasses, Editor of FELIX, Dwight Mann, complete with
nuts, and last but definitely not least, J Christ as Ken Mann
(Dwight's brother), the person who writes all those silly SF Sock
articles in FELIX.

Fortunately the girl was able
to sink her teeth into the thumb
of the hand which held the pad to
her face. She also gave several
piercing screams which attracted
the attention of local residents
including students in Southside.
The area was soon swarming
with police, but the m a n fled and
avoided being caught.
Female students are reminded
of the dangers of walking alone in
the area behind Southside at
night. II anyone cannot avoid
doing so, they should get in touch
with R a e Snee i n the U n i o n
Office w h o w i l l be h a p p y to
advise them on hiring or buying
rape alarms.
U G M Q U A N D A R Y

hurridly altered last week, when it
was realised that bylaw changes
given their first reading on

passed yesterday.
