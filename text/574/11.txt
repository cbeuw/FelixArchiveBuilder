Gutteridge Cup
T H I S was a replay of the 15-15 draw at
London Hospital last term. The opposition
turned up half an hour late, and were greeted
in the first five minutes of the game with a late
Christmas present. From then on IC fought
back and the game developed into a kicking
match down the touchline. The Harlington
pitch was isuccessfully ruined by continual
forward movements which dominated the
latter part of the game.
T h a n k y o u to a l l the s u p p o r t e r s w h o
watched, and rendered verbal abuse to the
opposition. The referee came back to the
Union Bar and managed to crawl out about
10:30pm.

Football Seconds
A spirited second half performance allowed
the seconds to come from behind and win a
match that they should have had sewn up by
half-time.
In the first half Bedford rarely encroached
into IC's half of the pitch, such was the
strength of the w i n d . IC, however, were
unable to convert the territorial superiority
into goals. At the interval with a score of 0-0,
Bedford were feeling justifiably pleased, and
t h i n g s l o o k e d even bleaker for IC w h e n
Bedford went 1-0 up, five minutes into the
second half. IC fought back and were soon on
level terms when Esberger prodded the ball
home after a fine run. A close range shot from
V e e n m a n g a v e IC the l e a d , w h i c h was
promptly wiped out by Bedford's second
goal. The winner came ten minutes from time
when Saunder's accurate cross was met by a
powerful header from Carr which tore into the
net. For the remainder of the match, the IC
defence, in which Griffiths was outstanding,
held out for another two precious league
points.
T E A M : years, Curran, Beer, Armstrong,
Lakin, Griffiths, Esberger, Wiggins, Veenman,
Saunders, Carr.

Football Fourths
T H E visitors arrived late to find the Fourths
without a referee, again! After the Fifths
substitute agreed to officiate, G u y s kicked
off. With a very strong cross wind and greasy
surface there was little constructive football
played by either side.
IC a p p e a r e d c o m f o r t a b l e but G u y s
equalised towards the end of the half, when
a weak goalkick allowed an opposing forward
a free short from the edge of the box.
After half-time IC continued to go forward
in s e a r c h of t h e l e a d , G u y s h a d the
occasional break but Hugh C h o w n impressed
in defence for the Fourths.
IC regained the lead twenty minutes into
the half when Hawa produced a good turn
and cross which fell kindly for B U R N S who
scored from six yards. This goal settled the
match and gave the Fourths revenge for their
only league defeat of the season.
T E A M : Gilbert, Maddy, Lay, Chown, Milner,
BURNS, Buckley, Graves, McNicholas,
Dolan, BURNS, Hawa.
RCS Hockey
L A S T W E D N E S D A Y , R C S Hockey put in a
heartening performance that made a mockery
of claims that the team is dead. In a potentially
difficult match away to Kings Coll, who are
having a successful season, R C S dominated
the first half-hour of the match and were very
unlucky not to score on numerous occasions.
Looking solid if unspectacular in defence,
R C S attacked confidently with latest recruit
harding and 'old hand' Farrington looking
s h a r p . H o w e v e r , as frustration grew, the
match deteriorated and play became scrappy.
In the s e c o n d half, K i n g s c o n f i d e n c e
increased and while R C S were still making
s c o r i n g o p p o r t u n i t i e s , it was K i n g s w h o
scored three goals in their best patch in the
middle of the second half. Mention must be
made of Steve Leinster's magnificent hook
shot saving a certain goal and of the mystery
appearance of a 'damaged' kidney in one of
the Kings defenders.
Altogether, this was a highly encouraging
performance and one which promises victory
for R C S in 1981.
T E A M : Williams, Rogers, Bird, Leinster,
Sharpe, Pound, Baxter, Taylor, Farrington,
Harding, Purdy, Morgan.

Snooker
A F T E R an absence of a few weeks your
snooker correspondant is back and on the
p a g e s of F E L I X ( h o p e f u l l y ) . A lot of
movement has occured at the top of the UL
League. It appears as if our C team leads,
followed by the A team, and then the B team.
So IC are doing extremely well, especially the
B team who are now fighting back and look
like snatching the title.
The A team (a spent force) were the only IC
team to lose last week. The brilliant B team
were bouyant after beating L S E by four
frames to one. Kelly lost our only frame and
his position in the team is being scrutinized
by Proudlove
The C team won five-nil against Bedford
College. This has put them on top of the
league, however they meet the on-form B
team in a few weeks.
Ten-Pin Bowling
O N Saturday (17th) the Bowling Club played
t h e i r h o m e m a t c h a g a i n s t P o r t s m o u t h
Polytechnic, who had won the away tie 10-0.
The result of this latest meeting was again a
defeat but by 8-2, with the A team winning the.
two points. Their 4-0 victory rarely seemed in
doubt with good performances by Ng, Lau
and Cook, playing his first A team game. The
B team also l o o k e d set for victory after
winning their first game, but this was due to
bad bowling by the Portsmouth side. This
quickly improved and the end result was a 3-1
defect, despite Harrison showing the form
which could have seen him in the A team, an
offer he declined. Quinn bowled very well for
the C team, which included Ann Sudell, an
o v e r s p i l l from the ladies, but c o u l d not
prevent a 4-0 defeat. The ladies also suffered
this fate, despite g o o d individual perfor-
mances.
Future events included a home match this
Saturday (24th) against Southampton and the
Brunei Doubles Tournament on the 31st. The
singles competition should have started last
Wednesday, but late entries will be accepted
next Wednesday (28th), everybody welcome.

Running
IMPERIAL C O L L E G E annually sends a team
to the illustrious Batavierenrace in Holland.
The race is a relay with 25 stages between 2
a n d 5 m i l e s l o n g , e a c h r u n n e r b e i n g
accompanied by a team-mate on a bicycle.
Last year, we finished in a surprise second
place out of 150 teams.
As you can imagine, this is no ordinary
race. It starts at midnight as the first group of
runners, joggers and struggling Swedes sets
off, a n d e n d s in t h e a f t e r n o o n in t h e
expansive grounds of Einschede University.
Its students host a massive party in the
evening, providing food and a wide variety of
music in the setting of their cavernous union
building.
This year, the dates are April 23-26 and the
cost should be well under £40 with a grant.
We still need several more people to make up
the team, including three ladies and hopefully
an extra m i n i b u s driver. A n y o n e w h o is
vaguely interested s h o u l d contact M a r k
Thwaites, Mech Eng 3.
Trampolining
FOR T H O S E of you who like bouncing up

ground at last. We now meet every Wednes-
day at 5:00pm in the Courtauld Hall, Queen
Elizabeth's College, Campden Hill Road (Just
off Kensington High Street).
Warning: Do not ask the old lady in the
foyer of Q E C for directions, or she will turn
you away ( Q E C people are always com-
plaining about her). Just walk in, turn right
and go up to the first floor.
