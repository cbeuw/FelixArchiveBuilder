Dear Sir
M a y I just say that I am now
in my fifth year at I C and during
that time I ate cooked Mooneys
for o n l y the first six m o n t h s
(Linstead meals excepted, but
there I had little choice). After
that time, I decided enough was
e n o u g h , a n d t u r n e d to items
which needed no, or m i n i m u m ,
p r e p a r a t i o n : y o g h u r t , m i l k ,
s a n d w i c h e s , crisps, a n d M a r s
bars. I then cooked my own,
m o r e b a l a n c e d m e a l i n the
evening.
In 1979, I started my P h D as a
P R I s t u d e n t at the B r i t i s h
M u s e u m ( N a t u r a l H i s t o r y ) ,
attached to I C , and have never
e a t e n i n C o l l e g e s i n c e . T h e
B M ( N H ) canteen is far superior
in all ways.
Also since 1976, I have had the
pleasure (I use the w o r d a d -
visedly) to eat in the refectories of
s e v e r a l o t h e r c o l l e g e s a n d
universities as varied as M a n -
chester, B a t h , Sussex, Q M C ,
Herriott-Watt, K i n g s College,
Cambridge and U E A . A L L are
of higher quality than I C , and
that must say something.
T h e n why the hell is it that if
they can do it, Imperial College
of S c i e n c e a n d T e c h n o l o g y
cannot?
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
M a y wc draw the attention of
your readers to the formation of a
n e w s o c i e t y ? T h e P o l i t i c a l -
E x t r e m i s t , R e v o l u t i o n a r y a n d
Visionary Society. This name
was c h o s e n not b e c a u s e the
society has as its aim any of the
above, but because its initials
s p e l l P E R V S O C . ( W e l l , i t ' s
better than S C A B isn't it? or its
V e r y D r u n k version, V C S C A B . )
The purpose of the society is to
enable its president and vice-
president to get back into hall
next year. T o do this wc need at
least twenty members.
T o become a m e m b e r you
must firstly subscribe to the
C o l l e g e m e d i c a l i n s u r a n c e
scheme and secondly you must go
to the top of Queens Tower on a
c l o u d l e s s m o o n l i t n i g h t at
midnight and shout S N O T as
loudly as you can at least ten
t i m e s . T h i s is k n o w n as the
P E R V S O C C H A N T , and is an
a c r o n y m of " S e l d o m N e e d
O r g a n T r a n s p l a n t s " . T h i s is
b e l i e v e d to be a n a n c i e n t
Chadian Marxist-Geurilla's anti-
sexist fertility chant. Members
should have no known relatives,
or at least only know their known
relatives not more than relatively
well, if at all (this doesn't count).
Meetings take place twice weekly
in the Chemistry Sub-basement,
where it is hot and sweaty (but
don't tell anyone, because we're
not really allowed down there
you know!)
P E R V S O C is not a registered
charity (although we do hold
collections for non-oppressed
people who want to have their
h u m a n r i g h t s v i o l a t e d by a
military junta).
See you at the next meeting!
H o w a r d R u d d (Chcm 1)
a n d A n o n (also of C h e m 1),
whose initials are S H , but the rest
of his name wishes to remain
anonymous.
Sir
I am writing to you with some
information which may well be of
interest to certain readers of your
newspaper.
Since I came to Southside at
the end of last September, I have
been intrigued by the internal
telephone system, and especially
the staircase phones. It did not
take me long to discover that by
r e m o v i n g the w a l l p a n e l just
above the fridge I could connect
an extension to my own room. In
the middle of last term, therefore,
I returned home to bring up my
own handset and extension lead.
T h e n , a f t e r a h a s t y b i t o f
rewiring one night, I was able to
link m y r o o m to the rest of
Southside.
Covering up my actions so far
has been easy. The main risk of
discovery came from the cleaners,
so I h i d t h e p h o n e i n the
wardrobe, and silenced the bell
so as not to give the game away.
The system worked very well, but
was a bit limited, not being able
to dial outside Southside.
Imagine my delight when I
read that the w h o l e i n t e r n a l
system was to be put at m y
disposal. I can see that this will
be very useful in the weeks to
come.
I know what I a m doing in this
matter, as I a m sponsored by the
G P O and I will be happy to
explain to anyone who is i n -
terested how to go about it.
For obvious reasons, I regret
that I must remain anonymous,
but I will try to correspond with
p e o p l e t h r o u g h these pages
(unless M r Marshall censors it) or
on technical problems via Box
32, F E L I X Office.
