Spotting submarines is a tall enough order
for any airborne radar system.
But the A E W Nimrod's radar can actually
identify different classes of submarine.
Handling a design brief for such a system
would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for
most people.
But to the engineers at Marconi Avionics
it's an everyday occurence. Because unless a
problem borders on the impossible, it seldom
comes to us in the first place.
