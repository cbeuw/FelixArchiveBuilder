U n d e r Bylaw 19, referring to
B y l a w changes, it states " n o
alteration in the Bylaw of the
U n i o n shall be made without the
approval of a two thirds majority
at two General Meetings held not
less than 28 College days but not
m o r e t h a n 40 C o l l e g e d a y s
apart." There were 12dayssepara-
tingthe last two U G M S , and there
w o u l d h a v e b e e n f o r t y - t w o
College days between successive
readings of the proposed amend-
ments. If the meeting had went
ahead on the original date, it
w o u l d h a v e m e a n t t h a t the
changes would have had to be
reintroduced on February 19,
and would then not take effect
until the beginning of the next
session. It also seemed unlikely
that there w o u l d be q u o r a t e
U G M s next term, so the bylaw
changes would drag on into the
next session or fail to be accepted
unless the meeting was brought
forward.
The three proposed changes
involved enabling more College

members, removing the Perma-
nent W o r k i n g Party from the
U n i o n C o u n c i l , and deleting the
I C W A c o n s t i t u t i o n f r o m the
Bylaws.
The controversy over I C W A
has been going on for some time.
A t present, the problem is that
f o r I C W A to a l t e r i t s o w n
constitution it needs a turnout of
100 members (from the women at
IC) to have a quorate meeting;
but I C W A has not had such a
meeting for a long period. Hence,
it is unable to alter itself whilst its
constitution is contained in the
b y l a w s . It w a s t h e r e f o r e
suggested that the U n i o n should
remove I C W A from the bylaws
and leave the way open for a new

brought back into the bylaws in
the future.
W h e n it was realised that the
first readings would be mean-
ingless if the next meeting was
held on the proposed date, the
meeting was brought forward by
two weeks, to February 5, and
the d e a d l i n e for m o t i o n s was
therefore set at J a n u a r y 29, but
due to a lack of publicity by the
U n i o n , and F E L I X not being
published last week, few people
know of this change.

efficiently publicise the meeting,

" A l l alterations to the Bylaws

Hair
Raiser
D A V E G A Y E R , Guilds Presi-
dent, is dying his hair in loud
c o l o u r s , as a p r e l i m i n a r y to
having it all shaved off, in the
near future.
A t the end of last week Dave
was seen with his usual brown
hair bleached to a bright yellow,
and this week his hair has been
s h o c k i n g p i n k . S p e a k i n g to
F E L I X about the situation, he
said he had meant his hair *.o be
in Guilds colours, but it had come
out pink instead. H e 1

although many boys regarded
pink as repulsive, it found favour
with the girls. H e added that he
wanted to object about the way
he was treated in the 'Goat in
Boots' public house in F u l h a m
R o a d , where he was refused
service, and then thrown out,
because he was thought to be a
punk. H e stated that he had no
regrets about his actions so far,
but d e c l i n e d to c o m m e n t o n

have cut off for R a g .
The amount collected so far is
£150 towards a target of £250.
