Forty-two
O n Monday night, the Beit telly lounge was
crowded as usual for the weekly dose of the
Hitchhiker's Guide. A few of the seats were
occupied by non-Beit residents much to the
annoyance of one Beit resident who singled
out one of the non-residents and demanded
that he vacate the chair. While I don't agree
with his bully-boy tactics he has a point which I
must concede is difficult to make in any other
way.
But on the other hand, there has been no
Union telly lounge for some time so it is only to
be expected that the Beit Lounge should be
used as such. Let's save all this hassle and
refurnish the Union telly lounge with a telly.
After all, every week we hear how many more
thousands of pounds Rae Snee has had tocount
from the Lower Lounge gaming machines.
W h i l e I realise that the last telly was
vandalised, I'm sure that members of Union
Council will be only too willing to perform
" t e l l y d u t y " n o w that M r P a s s m o r e has
withdrawn bar duty.
I don't know if any of you know this, but
there has been much controversy recently
over adverse criticism of College catering. So
to prevent V i c t o r M a n d his t e a m f r o m
becoming excessively paranoid, this week's
puzzle is to offer them encouragement and
publicity.
In the addition sum below, each different
letter represents a different digit; and any given
letter, whenever it occurs, always represents
the same digit. Punctuation should be ignored.

UGM Quandary
Last week, F E L I X informed Liz Lindsay that
the bylaw changes discussed at the last U G M
of last term could not be read as too much
time would have elapsed.
So the U G M was brought forward to
February 5. Now, due to a number of things
such as F E L I X not being able to publicise this
last week, the lack of any Union publicity, the
motions deadline having passed and the C N D
lecture (which would have provided most of
the audience if last term's U G M is anything to
go by) it seems likely that this next U G M will
be inquorate. A n d those bylaw changes will
STILL not have their second reading. One of
these is the motion to delete I C W A from the
bylaws; a debate which has dragged on for far
too long. I C W A is simply clutching at straws
for its survival — it could have survived by an
i n v a l i d s e c o n d r e a d i n g , a n d it will now
probably survive due to an inquorate U G M .
I C W A , as it s t a n d s at p r e s e n t , is not
achieving a n y t h i n g as it cannot muster a
quorate meeting, so survival in its present form
is a pointless existence.
The only R E A L solution is to get rid of it and
form a more realistic women's group, if,
indeed, such a group is desired at all.
Incidentally, I don't see WIST as any kind of
answer either — they are simply a bunch of
female fanatics.
Old Preversions
J o h n P a s s m o r e may well think that the
standard of the food has improved since he
came here, but how can he say that one of the
main features of this i m p r o v e m e n t is the
introduction of the cook-freeze system? I
would say that this has only served to make
matters worse. M r Mooney's largely incom-
petent staff just can't handle it — resulting in
the kind of cook-freeze abuse we reported last
term with mouldy food.
Even M r Mooney admits (see F E L I X 569)
that the cook-freeze system has been " a
limited success . . . . it has not been used to its
full potential" and that he has bad staff.
Stop Press
The Blood Doning session detailed in the
I C C A G article in this F E L I X has just been
cancelled.
Thanks to
Patrick, Steve, Dave, Shanne, Mark, Colin,
Phil, Scaramouche, Ian and Maz.
For the sake of pedants I suppose I should
also indicate that the numbers are integers in
base 10, and the letter O does not necessarily
represent 0.
Y o u r task is to reconstruct the sum.
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me c/o
FELIX by 1:00pm on Wednesday. The winner
will receive a choice of £5 cash (donated by
Mend-A-Bike) or a slice of THE minced beef
roll.
Solution to Last Puzzle
6oz, 7oz, 9oz.
Other solutions need a l o z weight, which "I
manage without".
Congratulations to Wing Lai, Physics 1, who
can collect his prize from the office.
In this column, I try to set puzzles which
cannot easily be solved by computer. I can't
prevent people using computers, of course,
but I c a n offer the following discourage-
ments which apply to most of my puzzles, and
especially to this week's.

Firstly, the 'correct' approach will lead to the
solution in less time than it takes to write and
d e b u g an e f f i c i e n t c o m p u t e r p r o g r a m ,
although the correct approach will not be easy
to spot. A n d secondly, programs which solve
p u z z l e s c a n w a s t e s e v e r a l m i n u t e s of
computer time, because they usually need
several nested loops.
Having said all this, if anyone does solve a
Scaramouche puzzle on a computer (either
this week or any week) I'd be interested if they
would enclose a listing of their program with
their solution together with a note of the
amount of C P U time they used in debugging
and running it.
The last two puzzles have been fairly easy, so
this week you've got Mooney meat rolls to
contend with; you won't find anything much
tougher than that.
A n d my granny has asked me to pass on her
thanks to all those who wished her well after
the last puzzle; unfortunately she feels she is
now too old to appear in any more James
Bond films.
