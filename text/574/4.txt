SHIRLEY WILLIAMS gave a talk, on the Brandt Report, at Imperial
College on Thursday January 15th. Mrs Williams asked FELIX to
stimulate Interest and to Increase student awareness of the contents
of the Report. The following article Is based on her lecture, the
Report ('North-South: a programme for survival') and a personal
Interview.
The Report takes its title from the belief that major international
initiatives are needed if mankind is going to survive. For the hundreds of
millions of people who live on the edge of starvation in the developing
countries, the South, this is a matter of obvious fact. The industrialised
countries, the North, have not been willing in the past to go very far towards
accepting the South's case that the world economy works to the South's
disadvantage. The Report argues today, in almost every field of the world's
present troubles, a substantial number of the solutions depend on
recognising the mutual interests between North and South.
M r s W i l l i a m s b e g a n by
commenting on the present staggering
growth of world population. Over one
million people are added to the
population of the world every five
days. By the year 2000 world
population is likely to have increased
from its present level of 4.3 billion to
approximately 6.3 billion. 90% of the
increase will take place in the Third
World. The rapid rise in population
compounds the task of providing food,
jobs, shelter, education and health
services, of mitigating absolute
poverty, and of meeting the colossal
financial and administrative needs of
rapid urbanisation.
Estimates of how many people in
the Third World live in conditions of
absolute poverty have been put at
approximately 800 million. The
c o m b i n a t i o n of m a l n u t r i t i o n ,
illiteracy, disease, high birth rates,
underemployment closes off the
avenues of escape; and while other
groups are increasingly vocal, the
poor and illiterate are usually and
conveniently silent. The Brandt Shirley Williams
Report states that priority must be
given to the needs of the poorest
countries and regions. The removal of
poverty requires both substantial
resource transfers from the developed
countries a n d an increased
determination of the developing
countries to improve economic
management and deal with social and
economic inequalities.
The Commission believed that the
world cannot wait for the longer term
measures before embarking on an
immediate action programme for the
next five years to avert the most
serious dangers. A n Emergency
Programme was proposed having the
following principal elements:
1. A large-scale transfer of resources
to developing countries.
2. A n international energy strategy
with the aims of ensuring
regular supplies of oil, rigorous
conservation, more predict-
able and gradual price
increases in real terms and the
development of alternative
and renewable energy sources.
3. A global food programme.
4. A start on some major reforms in
the international monetary
and financial system, in which
all parties can participate
more fully and an acceleration
of efforts to i m p r o v e
d e v e l o p i n g c o u n t r i e s '
c o n d i t i o n s of trade i n
commodities and m a n u -
factures.
Mrs Williams said that she was
pleased to choose Imperial to say that
a fresh approach to higher education
is required. "We must recognise that

Dear Sir
Last week a letter addressed to
secretary of the C o n s e r v a t i v e
Society, W i l l i a m Cortazzi, C h e m
E n g 2, was put i n his depart-
mental letter-rack. T h e letter,
from the Houses of Parliament
was stolen within a couple of
hours.
T h e Secretary has h a d to write
to a l l P a r l i a m e n t a r i a n s w i t h
w h o m t h e S o c i e t y has b e e n
corresponding to explain what
has happened so that we can find
the tradition of exporting high
technology to the South can do
immense harm to the culture of under-
developed countries. Imperial College
is a singularly appropriate place to
investigate new concepts i n
engineering," she said.
The Venice Summit in June 1980,
which was a meeting of the political
leaders "of the Western World and
Japan, did not consider the Brandt
Report seriously because priority was
given to attacking inflation. However,
there has been an encouraging
individual response in the United
Kingdom as over 50,000 copies of the
Report have been sold. " I hope that
you have a group at Imperial who arc
interested in organising local
campaigns to argue the case put by the
Report. So often campaigns die - this
one better not die," said Mrs
Williams. The Rector, The Lord
Flowers, commented that the Report
is on sale at the IC bookshop price
Â£1.95.
Peace
Finally, using the words of Willy
Brandt, "If reduced to a simple
denominator, this Report deals with
peace. War is often thought of in terms
of military conflict, or even
annihilation. But there is a growing
awareness that an equal danger might
be chaos - as a result of mass hunger,
economic disaster, environmental
catastrophes, and terrorism. So we
should not think only, of reducing the
traditional threats to peace, but also of
the need for change from chaos to
order."
C o l i n P a l m e r
the s e n d e r a n d d i s c o v e r t h e
contents.
However the reputation of the
College (and the society) will
inevitably be tarnished where it
matters most, in the Houses of
Parliament.
As a Conservative Society we
are committed to make people
more aware of the philosophy
and policies of the Conservative
Party. A s an I C Social C l u b we
are committed to enhancing the
quality of life of the I C student.
T h e m a i n way to combine these
two commitments is to exploit
our position i n South K e n a n d
invite good outside speakers to
address meetings at College wheh
a r e free a n d o p e n to n o n -
members.
A n y t h i n g which jeopardises
our ability to attract speakers of
t h e h i g h e s t c a l i b r e , o u g h t
therefore to be of encern to a l l
thoughtful students.
If the thief ever joins that set of
people even for a moment, then
he must realise that the letter
ought to be returned.
Tours faithfully
