T H E P G G R O U P DINNER was held in the
Carvery at the Rembrandt Hotel on December 3.
There were no speeches or other formalities and
everybody enjoyed a superb meal, most of us
being able to manage at least a couple of helpings.
The hotel pianist was not appreciated by
everybody and the Union Bar prices were more
manageable than the hotel bar prices, so the
evening was rounded off in the Union Bar.
There will be a Ploughman's Lunch in the
Union Consort Hall on February 18. About one
hundred people attended the last Ploughman's
Lunch and a number of people without tickets
had to be turned away at the door. We will cater
according to the number of tickets sold in
advance. Tickets at 80p which includes a free pint
of beer, may be bought from the Union Office in
advance or for £1 on the door.
At the Board of Studies Meeting on October
29 the report for 1979/80 from the Graduate
Studies Committee received much attention. A
s t a t i s t i c a l a n a l y s i s of P h D s t u d e n t s who
commenced courses in 1974 showed that of 177
students over one third had not submitted for
their degree after four years of study. A
questionnaire has been circulated so that
postgraduate opinion may be assessed with a
view to producing a well argued case for the next
Board of Studies Meeting. You are asked to fill
this in and return it to the Union Office. You can
maintain your anonymity by tearing off the
address label and returning the completed
questionnaire via the internal mail. Spare copies
of the questionnaire may be picked up from the
Union Office.

L A S T W E E K we had two of our best lectures so
far this year. "The End of the Universe" came and
went without any terrible effects; and a few of us
discovered why the hottest day in summer isn't
June 21, amongst other fads last Thursday.
Future events include a lecture on January 29
by Dr Colegrave at 1:00pm in Physics Lecture
Theatre 3 called "Strong-coupling Theory in
Superconductors".
O n February 12, Magnus Pyke will be lecturing
on "The Understandability of Science".
Our Annual Dinner is provisionally booked for
Friday, February 27. Tickets will be available
soon.
Mountaineering
Club
L A S T T E R M , I C M C held five weekend meets.
These were generally very successful, and we
were favoured by good weather. C o r n w a l l ,
Swanage, Snowdonia, Derby and, for the first
time, DeVon were all visited. These are typically
the areas to which we travel, although occasional
trips to the Lakes are made, and to Scotland to
watch the New Year rain.
I C M C is principally a rock-climbing club, but
some members are also enthusiastic hill-walkers,
and our meets are a cheap means of getting away
from London for the weekend. Typical cost is £5-
£10. Accomodation is in huts or camping (club
tents).
The next event after the Dinner Meet to
Llamberis (starting this evening) will be in a
fortnight's time. Location will depend on the
driver, who shouts loudest, the weather, and,
perhaps, democracy. To find out more, see us in
the Union Lower Lounge on Tuesday evenings
(9:00pm onwards — look for the noisy American
shouting loudest); watch the club noticeboard
(outside the same r o o m ) ; or contact Leo
Hermacinski, Hec Eng 2 or Dave Scott, Life Sci 2.
Astrosoc
A S T R O - S O C is the society for all those of you
interested, in one way or another, in astronomy
You can forget about astrology and science-
fiction, if you join us you can find out about real
deep-space adventure and experiences, first-
hand, the very real excitement in observing
objects even older than mankind. For a little light
relaxation you can consider the beginning of the
Universe and ponder afresh on how it will end
(not on the 20th January!). Science fiction may
look to "where no man has gone before" but
astronomy can take you there!
The society exists to provide facilities for both
the theorists and the practically minded — we
own six-inch and eight-inch Newtonian reflectors
as well as a 12-inch Cassegrain. The latter is
currently inoperative (it is in lots of little bits "in
half an observatory in Silwood Park!), but we
hope, with the help of new members, to rebuild
the telescope and to complete the observatory in
the near future. Other projects being considered
are the building of radio telescope and/or solar
telescope. If anyone has any further jdeas for
projects our Equipment Officer will be most
pleased to hear from them.
Turning away from the practical side of
astronomy, we have a number of films and talks
planned for this term. Dates for your diary are:
J a n u a r y 27, Film 'Challenge and Promise',
P h y s i c s L T 1 , 1:30pm; F e b r u a r y 5, F i l m
'Universe', Physics LT2, 1:30pm; February 13,
Dr Gary Hunt 'The Voyager Project', Physics
LT1, 1:00pm; February 26, Dr John Taylor
'Black Holes', Physics LT1, 1:00pm.
Everyone is most welcome to come to these
events, which are usually held on Tuesday/Thurs-
day lunchtime in Lecture Theatre 3 in the Physics
Building, but if you're in any doubt have a look at
the posters you'll see scattered throughout
College.
