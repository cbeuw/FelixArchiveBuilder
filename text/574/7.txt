SF Sock
Plays
Touched
T H E P L A Y is set in and around Sheiton,
Nottingham, during the hundred days between
V E (Victory in Europe) Day and V J (Victory in
Japan) Day. This is a very interesting period in
British social history; the election of a Labour
Government, hopes for a brave new world, the
setting up of the U N , before cynicism, the
B e r l i n c r i s i s , the i r o n c u r t a i n a n d d i s -
illusionment set in. We are led to suppose that
we are seeing the period through the eyes of
a 'typical' Midlands working class family, in
particular those of the c e n t r a l c h a r a c t e r ,
S a n d r a . W e see t h e i r h o p e s , fears a n d
anxieties: the men coming back, then not
coming back, socialism.
However, as in so many of Stephen Lowe's
plays, he fails to make a coherent point. If he
wrote it as a mood piece, a social documen-
tary, then he succeeded; as a play it does not.
The threads are not woven but tangled, the
plot vague and patchy. I think M r Lowe has
excellent material tor a T V soap opera, but
theatre must be more positive and direct.
If you like industrial working class humour
tinged with tragedy then this is the play for
you, however threadbare the storyline, the
mood is there, there is some fine acting by
Marjorie Yates as Sandra, Sharon Duce as her
w o r l d l y s i s t e r a n d M i k e P a c k e r as the
pathetically intense Johnny. It plays at the
Royal Court Theatre until late March.
Here's afunny thing
John Bardon, recently seen in a supporting
role in All The Trimmings, w i t h R o g e r
M c G o u g h , returns to the Lyric Studio to star
as M a x Miller, the "Cheekie Chappie" in a
play written by R W Shakespere (no relation).
Apparently M a x Miller was a famed Music
Hall artiste before and after the war. The
performance largely consists of jokes and
s k e t c h e s , including various c a t c h p h r a s e s ,
some of which sounded vaguely familiar.
Having never seen the real thing in action
(Mr Miller died in 1963) I could not vouch for
the accuracy of M r Bardon's performance. I
can only say that he delivered the performance
with Bounce and Verve, which may have been
reminiscent of the man himself.
It was an enjoyable carefree evening with
p l e n t y of l a u g h s a n d g r o a n s h e a r t i l y
recommended for the nostalgic amongst you.
It plays at the Lyric Studio until the end of the
month.

W E A R E S O R R Y a b o u t the last m i n u t e
cancellation of the visit to Perkins' Engines in
January. This was due to circumstances beyond
even our control; Massey-Ferguson is going bust!
The next visit is to the N A T I O N A L G A S
T U R B I N E E S T A B L I S H M E N T at P y e s t o c k ,
Farnborough on Wednesday, February 25. This
will be an all day visit. For further details, see the
Mech Eng Soc noticeboard.
Our first lecture meeting of the term will take
place in ME542 on Tuesday, February 3 at
1:00pm when Maurice George from Harwell will
present a talk on the Fusion Reactor.
The really exciting news is that in the very near
future, you will be able to purchase — at very
reasonable rates — your very own Mech Eng Soc
sweatshirt. Stay tuned!
A Gardam
C R A S H ! The Captain's head hit the deck. For
this very reason he never learnt the mind-
expanding news that had caused mild hysteria on
several of the major land masses of our oh so
humbled planet. Coming soon — more popular
than Quintet — more intellectually stimulating
than Star Trek - The Movie — more spectacular
than Blake's Seven — more restrained than
Rollerball — yes, it's — what is it? O h yes, it's
Santa Claus Conquers The Martians, the film
that does for cinema what Larry Niven did for the
Oxford English Dictionary. Lex Luthor once said
that he would unravel the mysteries of the
universe by reading the back of a bubble-gum
wrapper. This however, has nothing to do with
Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. (Soundtrack
available from SF Sock Tapes Ltd.) Come to
Mech Eng 220 on February 3 at 6:30pm and be
amazed. Santa Claus Conquers The Martians is
definitely one of the top five worst films ever
conceived by the mind of man.
We might — mind you I just said might — be
having a short second feature called Hardware
IVars. Little is known of this film, but those who
have seen it tasted and found it good (i.e. funny).
I write this fresh from a game of 'call my bluff
replete with weird tales of eldritch sex acts on
other planets. Result: a draw, proving that the
committee are all equally strange. O h well, that's
life, boy.
And now, a mention for Steve Ridley. This shy
unassuring student of mechanical engineering has
missed every single SF Sock event this year, and
it's not his fault. He deserves our deep sympathy
and respect. Also he hasn't been mentioned in
FELIX for ages. Keep it up Steve.
Item: an astrophysicist at Bedford College has
developed the theory that the starship Enterprise
is made of concrete. He is currently engaged in a
long term study; watching every Star Trek
episode to check for wheelbarrows. I will relay his
findings as I receive them. That's all for now folks.
See you in the next FELIX, if it exists.
Yours in stasis.
