Council Report
In the President's report, it was decided that as the Union had no control
over supervision of College bars, and no financial connection, it should not
be called upon to provide duty officers in the bars at weekends. Order in
the bars, it was thought, should be the responsibility of the Bar Manager.
M r Passmore proposed a change in the way sabbatical salaries are reckoned
which would keep such salaries in line with postgraduate grants in future
years, and be easier to calculate. This was accepted. O n the F E L I X
controversy the President said he was happy with last week's issue, not just
because it contained one letter expressing a derogatory opinion of M r
Marshall's editing so far. Questioned on the matter he said that he had only
been prepared to take further action, not that he would take such action in
any case. He did not think that he had climbed down over this matter. D r
Schroter was now happy that the original offending article did not
represent the views of the whole Union, after being assured by the six
Executive members that it did not. It was suggested by the meeting that the
original article was self-evidently not meant to be taken seriously and that
nowhere in last week's F E L I X was there the apology from M r Marshall
that had been demanded from him, but these views were not widely held at
the meeting.
Rae Snee said in her report that the clear profit from amusement
machines run by the Union was £3,148 this session.
The subject of casual staff in the bars was raised, but as bar managers
need only get M r Mooney's go-ahead on any day, the situation was left as it
is. The possibility of removing Union regalia from the bookshop was
discussed.
Liz Lindsey, in her report, said that things were starting to happen about
I N C O S T (International Conference of Students of Technology).
U N E S C O from Paris intended to give $1,000 in sponsorship. She
continued by saying that plans were being considered to re-arrange the two
lower levels of Southside into a "post-experience" centre, but retaining the
shop, which takes over £300 each day.
There was heated discussion over two matters in the major sub-
committee chairman's report. The first concerned a request from the
Holland Club to use Squash Courts in College for a limited period each
week. In theory this was thought acceptable, but in practice, the facilities
were well used at present, and any specific time allocation would be
difficult to make.
In the discussion on the P W P report, it was argued that M r Mooney
should not be" "let off the hook" for the "dish slop" he continued to offer.
M r Passmore explained that he was elected on a platform of co-operation
with College authorities, and that each service, e.g. refectories, nursery and
accomodation had to pay for themselves.
The main point of the Publication Board Report concerned the actions
this term of the F E L I X Editor. Whilst it was generally acknowledged that
there had been no apology as such, it was thought that there had been a
sufficiently fair explanation of the situation which represented an apology
to M r Mooney. It was noted that there was an apology as such to Miss Rae
Snee.
The other reports from R C C , S C C , S C A B , O S C and R a g were
accepted.
W h e n the meeting reached other business, N i c k M o r t o n , A C C
Chairman, proposed that Council should say that it believed R C C should
have a uniform low subscription rate for its members. He thought that the
Union should provide a service for its members and should ask College to
pay for major expenses. After much discussion the motion was accepted.

T H E U N I O N P R I N T U N I T
has been facing technical diffi-
culties recently, resulting in the
late production of F E L I X during
this term.
Problems started in the second
week of term when the M u l t i l i t h
1850 offset lithography printing
machine broke down. N o engin-
eer was able to repair it until
T h u r s d a y a f t e r n o o n , a n d this
m e a n t t h a t F E L I X was not
printed until Friday. Hence, it
was d i s t r i b u t e d o n M o n d a y .
M e a n w h i l e , t h e t y p e s e t t e r
developing machine broke on
Friday. The model is ni longer
made, so spare parts would be diffi-
cult to come by, and a replacement
would cost over £600. However,
an engineer called on M o n d a y ,
and fixed it with a piece of string.
Last Thursday, disaster struck.

A N U M B E R of Princes Gardens
residents have been getting more
than they bargained for w h e n
parking cars illegally in Princes
Gardens and behind Linstead Hall.
The usual action is for a large
sticker (warning the driver that the
registration number has been noted
and a fine will be imposed if the car
is parked illegally again) to be
firmly glued to the back window.
It now appears as if some people
are taking the law into their own
hands by piercing tyres of cars that
shouldn't be there. In three days
last week, seven tyres from four cars
have been r u i n e d in a similar
manner — namely the side of the

irreparable damage. The damage
is done so as not to be immediately
obvious, e.g. at the kerb or next to
a wall. Further, the cars were not
all parked in the same allocated
space, and some were not parked in
an allocated space at all.
