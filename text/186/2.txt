SURPRISE?
Well, not really; after all, we have all been half expecting
i|t ever since the last new, irrevocable date of the long awaited
Union Meeting was announced. January 17th.? No, no, its
been changed again, this time to the 29th, utiles, of course, this
/appears inconvenient at last minute, in which case, the new date
will be the n-th of February, where n is an integer between
1 and 28 (or is it going to be the 29th ?).
Apparently, pressure has been exerted on the Executive by
the Union to change the date of the Union Meeting in view of
the fact that a large number of people are at the moment in
the throes of half-sessional exams, and can ill afford the odd
hour off one lunchtime to attend. As a result, the Meeting has
once again been postponed, this time to February 7.
On the fact fo it, all the postponements appear fully justified,
though an outside observer might be equally justified in describ-
ing them as a disguised filibuster, to kill the N U S issue dead
before it' gets on its feet'., Meanwhile, the President has still
not stated whether he is going to speak or not. and if so, on
what side. The suspense is killing.
C O L C U T T
I'm sick to death of this Common Market issue. Does it really
matter whether we go in or not ? Is it really worth all the hulla-
balloo ? Why can't we have another inquorate Union Meeting and
forget all about it ? Leave the politicians to it and get on with
the job of running the Imperial College Union.
It can't really be all that important—the President does not
seem to think it matters if we go in or not. Preece de G. thinks
" N O N , " but " M a c " Pearson (no'h') says "OUI." If it were all
that important, surely " Nehru " after the International. I wonder
Chandmal would stop sitting on if he's back yet ? It might be a
1
"l-i ftn *~\ nnj-1 f i l l u r l - n / - » L , r i i j - l a 1-*a'n
the fence and say which side he's
on. . Surely no President worth
his salt can be non-commital on
a serious issue.
The recent postponement of the
" Date " means that the political
manoeuvring which is going on
behind the scenes is going to con-
tinue. Let's hope the cold war
of suspicion which has built up
between the two " sides " which
are splitting the " union," will be
over by then. The NUS decision
is difficult enough to make with-
out having the debate confused
by petty bickering about irrele-
vant personal suspicions. It is
indeed a shame, that in this age
of Telestar, we still cannot com-
municate from one side of our
Union to the other. I hope that
when the day of judgment finally
comes the Union will still be in-
terested enough to turn up and
decide the issue.
I hear the Chairman of the
A C C was stranded in Cardiff
boon to have him buried in a
snow drift for the next Council
Meeting—it might finish in a
reasonable time then.
Where was Sennet last week ?
Could they have gone bankrupt ?
If they must pay the 'College
agent Id. a copy for selling the
rag, they must expect financial
disaster. It is a pity that
they should run out of funds so
early in the year . . .just when
we were getting interested in de-
velopments at U L U for a change.
I hope we will be kept posted
about the " Sacked President "
affair. Otherwise we shall never
know if he was sacked for acade-
mic reasons, political reasons or
whatever other reasons one's
imagination can cook up when
presented with only half the story.
Fancy supplying Worthington
" E " in the bar. According to
WHICH this is the strongest
draught beer on the market. It
is to be hoped that the lads can
take it.
EE
THE
Dear Sir,
" Hardly Hansard " was indeed
an apt name for Mr. Coombe's
report of the last Council Meet-
ing. Apart from the utterings of
the " pompous Mr. Pearson,"
" the tactful Dr. Weale," " the
pedantic Mr. Gardiner," and
Messrs. Morden and Haclin (no
adjectives supplied) the only other
contributions to Council's " amic-
able and stimulating three hour
discussions " was the continuous
tirade that I apparently conducted
against the " tmobled)" Execu-
tive. I was mentioned seven
times and successively described
as " watchful, redoubtablb, bit-
tingly sarcastic, pedantic, quibb-
ling" and of "speaking forcibly
and heatedly," and "fighting
back undeterred." I may well be
a naturally garrulous Welshman,
but surely I didn't dominate the
Council Meeting to the extent
that your misguided correspon-
dent implied.
Mr. Coombe's article also gave
the false impression that I am
against drunken dinners, that I
own a gymnasium and that I
oppose the Executive on every
issue as a matter of principle. He
does not seem to know the differ-
ence between the Athletic Com-
mittee and the ACC.
I hope, Sir, that if Council
ever again allows you to report on
their " stimulating" meetings,
you will appoint a more reliable
reporter.
Yours {sarcastically, watch-
fully, redoubtedly . . .)
D. H. PHILLIPS,
PS.—Why was it " surprising "
that Council " overwhelmingly "
voted £20 to compensate the
Dutch Students for the deplorable
theft of their coats ?
Dear Sir,
There are times when I feel that
" Felix " has all the excitement
and integrity of a Mooney meat
ball at 7.25 p.m. The title sports-
woman of the year was amusing.
Considering some of the people
who are considered men around
here, I am rather flattered -by the
title.
But that note in the write up of
the Mines Ball was totally un-
called for. (Note, Mr. Harris !)
The, only thing so far seen of
R.C.S. Cabaret was the Smoking
Concert, and the write up of this
at the time seemed to rather praise
the improvement. So why the
comment ? We all know what
the trend of the Smoking Concert
is, and it cannot be changed over-
night.
I will leave someone else, if any,
to comment on that opinion of the
Mines Cabaret.
We have had, in the past, such
comments as the " lack of life " in
RCS. Please don't continue the
S TO
EDITOR
trend. The energy would be
much better devoted to improving
other things; notably your own
paper.
Yours sincerely,
" Sportswoman of the Year."
ANYONE INTERESTED?
Dear Sirs,
I would like to get in touch
with some students for the pur-
pose of a language exchange. I
am myself German born, but have
been in this country for more than
20 years.
I am interested in an exchange
of German against French,
Spanish or Italian, of which three
languages I have a good working
knowledge, but no practice in
conversation classes. As I am
working, I would only be free in
the evening and. would prefer
somebody who lives in my area.
Thanking you for any assist-
ance you can give me.
MARGOT BLOOK.
Dear Sir,
I am writing to complain of the
anti-social action of a small but
growing number of Imperial Col-
lege students. I refer to the
queue-jumpers seen each day in
the snack-bar, and more particu-
larly the lower refectory. If these
people are so desperately hungry
that they cannot wait their turn.
I suggest they stock up with sand-
wiches at the beginning of the day.
If fortunately their physical state
is not verging on starvation could
they learn some manners and join
the end of the queue ?
Queue-jumping could easily be
dscouraged by members of the
queue resorting to bar tactics,
shouting " Out, out" until the
offender moved back.
I remain,
Yours faithfully,
K. HOCKING.
Dear Sir,
I would like to bring to the at-
tention of the College the follow-
ing points concerning the " Boat
Club fiasco."
(1) That the. Boat Club Com-
mittee decided unanimously that
the individuals concerned would
pay for any damages, before the
Executive had considered the
matter.
(2) That the Committee passed
a resolution recommending that
the Boat Club Dinner be held on
a day other than Morphy Day
next year, again before a similar
resolution had been made by the
Executive.
Subsequently, voluntary contri-
butions have raised a sum suffi-
cient to pay for the damages.
Yours sincerely,
D. R. DEAN,
Captain, I.C.B.C.
