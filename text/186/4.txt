A career
is what it's
worth
If you divide the population into two groups —those
who take T H E TIMES and those who d o n ' t — y o u find
this: those who don't take T H E TIMES are i n the great
majority. Those who do are either at the top i n their
careers, or are confidently headed there.
T H E TIMES both by its seniority i n experience and
by its incomparable prowess as a modern newspaper,
naturally commends itself to successful people. There
is no high level conference, no board meeting, no top
executive's private office into which T H E TIMES is
not apt to be taken.
This choice of a newspaper by people who get on is
indisputable.* In which of the two groups do y o u
place yourself?

PROFILE—DR. K. E. WEALE
This is not at all an easy essay to write, particularly when (a) its
subject is a friend, (b) he will see it before publication, and (c) he is
much bigger than I am. Let's face it: Ken Weale is bigger than
most of us, not only in sheer physical size but in talents and breadth
of interest as well. It is customary in these profiles to reveal the
subject's age. This I cannot do wtih any certainty, except to say
that he is probably even older than I am, and has achieved that
vulgar business of throwing the ball about (and the other players)
degree of maturity at which rugger-playing gentlemen abandon the
and take to refereeing. He continues to play cricket with considerable
skill and vigour, but we are now
unfortunately denied the equally
spectacular but wildly contradic-
tory accounts of their respective
prowesses delivered after Sunday
matches by Ken and Kitch (ex-
President Kitchen).
Academically, Ken is no mean
pundit on high-pressure chemical
manifestations of one sort and
another. Except on Lord's Days
in summer and Wealemas Day
(Birthday Dec. 26th) in winter, he
inhabits an extraordinary room
built almost entirely of sheet
iron, standing in a gloomy lab
in Chem. Eng. By applying an
eye to fortuitous bolt-holes, he
can observe the diligence of his
students : no doubt they can in-
dulge in the converse process.
His fame as an orator is wide-
spread, partly due to a fenile
and rather improbable imagina-
tion and a majestic delivery.
Rolling phrases of ingenious con-
struction and great complexity,
often with a hint of an elder
statesman about them, have de-
lighted many generations of stu-
dents. If one is part of the same
programme, one can expect to be
utterly overshadowed by a per-
formance which relies on consi-
derable feats of memory. A fav-
ourite source of quotations is the
great Dr. Johnson (" There is
nothing which has yet been con-
trived by man, by which so much
happiness is produced as by a
O ood tavern or inn.")
Equally famous is his rendition
of a speech (circa 1938) made by
a now-discredited national leader.
Performed in the I.C. bar, the
effect is fairly spectacular ; in the
Queen's, with suitable audience
participation, it is nearly as start-
ling as the original ; and it is re-
lated that the gala performance
at Jack McCoubrey's (ex-Sub-
Warden of Weeks Hall) bachelor
party woke up the Warden of an
adjacent Hall.
Residents of Falmouth Hall will
be singularly fortunate in their
Warden. Not only is Ken steeped
in the fine traditions of the origi-
nal Hostel, but he is suspected of
having started some of them. In
a reminiscent mood, he is inclined
to produce lurid tales of the im-
mediately post-war years, such as
the occasion of the explosion on
the Old Hostel roof, the conse-
quences of which are with us still.
Members of the Union, particu-
larly club treasurers, will know
him as custodian of the Union
coffers and a readv source of
wisdom, often providing elegant
solutions to awkward administra-
tive problems. From his shut-
tered concrete penthouse, Ken
will bring to bear on Falmouth
Hall these manifold talents and,
most important of all, a genuine
liking for and understanding of
his students.
