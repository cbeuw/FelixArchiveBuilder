UNION MEETING
POSTPONED
Meanwhile (See pages 2 and 6)
N.U.S. - the President sums up
An incredible number of rumours have been circulating around
the Uiion regarding NUS. Since it is vital that the arguments put
to the Union Meeting should have a factual basis, I have checked
up on a number of the relevant pros and cons. Having listened to
both sides, I feel sure that what you find in this article will be a
fairly representative factual case for both sides.
Accompanying this article is a line diagram of the structure
of NUS. This I hope will give you some idea of the basic skeleton
over which the fleshy parts of NUS have been built. It is these
accumulations that gave rise to conflicting opinions.
The case for NUS can be put like this :—
NUS is simply a body which led to believe that it was the
represents student opinion nation- Ministry's intention gradually to
ally. There is no question about
the fact that it is a representa-
tive body, in the sense that 97 per
cent, of the students in Britain are
members of it (approx. 175,000
members). What has the Union
done for students ? It is vague
to say that NUS campaign for
adequate grants, good welfare
condition and facilities for stu-
dents. What has it really
achieved in these directions ?
Here are some of the achieve-
ments :—
The Ministry of Pensions re-
quired a post-graduate student
to pay the heavy Class 2 contri-
butions as a self-employed per-
son. N.U.S. immediately took up
the matter with them and was

levy such contributions from all
post-graduates in the country, on
the grounds that they were en-
gaged in original research, could
not therefore be receiving super-
vision, and were consequently not
in full-time education.
After taking Legal advice, ne-
gotiating with the Ministry of
Pensions and National Insurance
and other bodies concerned,
approaching the University au-
thorities and having questions
asked in the House of Commons,
N.U.S. finally arranged through
Mr. Fred Mulley, M.P. for an Ad-
journment Debate on the case.
Shortly afterwards the Ministry
announced a complete reversal of
policy and agreed to repay in
cash any post-graduate student
from whom contributions had
been wrongly levied. The N.U.S.
was the only body which raised
this question on behalf of
students.
As N.U.S. regards the insur-
ance position of students as basic-
ally . unsatisfactory, short-term
policy of the Union has laid
down from time to time interim
methods of alleviating difficulties;
as an example, a resolution at
Council recommended that stu-
dents be allowed to repay their
Class 3 contributions during the
first six years of employment. The
point was taken up strongly with
the Minister and, after much ne-
gotiation, was conceded towards
the end of 1956.
Since nearly half the members
of ICU are postgraduate, this
Union has benefited considerably
in this respect
Pressure from NUS was the
main cause for the appointment
of the Anderson Committee
whose recommendations were
very substantially in line with
the NUS policy on grants. At the
moment, NUS is campaigning for
the abolition of the parental
means test, and is lobbying the
Standing Advisory Committee on
Awards constantly. They man-
aged to convince the Committee
in principle of the virtue of pay-
ment of a maintenance grant dur-
ing vacations ; the Ministry has
yet to accept this, but the pres-
sure is not being relaxed.
NUS publishes the standard
book on grants, the " Grants
Year Book " which includes the
details of grant arrangements of
all local authorities, etc. It lists
the major trusts and charities
which consider applications from
poor students. For some time,
NUS has been campaigning to
convince local authorities that
loans are not a proper form of
assistance to students. There
were 147 of these and the last one
was convinced in 1975. (Loans
are still offered by L.E.A.S. in
special circumstances).
NUS has submitted detailed
memoranda to the Robbins Com-
mittee on Higher Education, to
the Hale Committee and on safety
provisions in Institutes of higher
learning. It goes to great lengths
in doing research required to pre-
pare these memoranda which
have been very well received.
The main purpose of the
N.U.S. is to represent its members
in matters affecting their welfare.
It has, of course, no coercive
power as such but can achieve
its aims by winning public sup-
port and by bringing pressure to
bear on national, local and col-
lege authorities.
Most important of these are the
Ministry of Education and the
Department of Scientific and In-
dustrial Research. The Union's
staff and officers are constantly
in touch with them for discus-
sions on grants problems and
maintain a regular correspond-
ence direct with the Minister. In
turn, their officers now always
attend the N.U.S. Council Meet-
ings and the Parliamentary Secre-
tary to the Ministry has twice ad-
dressed Council. Deputations are
received by the education com-
mittees of the Parliamentary
Parties and Government Com-
mittees. Finally, a team of five
M.P.'s, Mr. John Hall (Con.),
Mr. John Jennings (Con.), Dr. H.
King (Lab.), Mr. Fred Mulley
(Lab.), and Mr. Donald Wade
(Lib.), and in the House of Lords,
the Rt. Hon. Lord Longford, all
of whom are Honorary Vice-
Presidents of the Union, assist it
in countless ways, particularly by
contacting Ministers personally,
asking questions in Parliament
and occasionally initiating de-
bates.
Now it is argued by those
against NUS that we have direct
influence. The Rector, for in-
stance, is on the Robbins Com-
mittee. In the past, in cases in-
volving individual students. IC
Union brought pressure to bear
and raised the matter successfully
in Parliament. In the past, the
UGC has visited the College, and
met the Union Executive to get its
views on grants, etc. In NUS we
would be lost in the enormous
numbers; our seven delegates are
hardly likely to have any great
effect in an NUS Council of
several hundred other delegates.
In any case, in conferences
where 242 motions are on the
agenda, to be dealt within the
space of 23 hours, it is doubtful
if anything useful can be
achieved. Why not keep our
identity ; by not dissolving in the
vast body of NUS. our voice will
surely be heard more distinctly.
IC cannot possibly lobby the
Government to the extent and
with the same intensity as NUS ;
it is not the main function of
ICU, but it is the function of
NUS. At best, we can help in
individual cases. And vet. our
Union members do benefit (as in
the case of Insurance payments)
due to the efforts of NUS, and
will continue to benefit.
NUS has many international
activities. " A considerable
amount of the Executive's time is
taken up by the question of world
student unitv" says the NUS
handbook. This provides a num-
ber of arguments against NUS.
