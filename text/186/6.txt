PRESIDENTIAL
LETTER •
Several people have brought it
to the notice of the Executive
Committee that they would not
be able to attend the I.C. Union
Meeting because of half-session
exams. The Executive decided
that since the NUS issue is impor-
tant, as many members of the
Union should attend and hear all
the arguments, before making a
decision. Hence we have changed
the date of the Union meeting to
February 7th.
I must apologise for this mis-
take, and also for the extremely
short notice given.

OVERSEAS SERVICE WEEK
While few of us wish to'know the future, many hope-
reasonably—to have a hand in shaping It; and this
requires acquaintance with what may lie ahead. But
traditional methods of probing the future are no longer
In favour. Crystal-gazing has obvious limitations.
Witches are prophets only of ultimate doom. So today
one turns, in the first instance, to the appointments
officer for the pathways to the future. We, for
our part, would like to elaborate what lies along
one of them—Unilever Research.
Research in Unilever means Industrial research:
research directed to specific ends: research with a
practical outcome. But not only that. No Industrial
protect or problem stands In Isolation. Its'roots rarely
lie In industry. So, research in Unilever also means
research In a number of contrasting fields—detergents,
edible fats, foods, cosmetics—and it means, further,
research in surface chemistry, glyceride chemistry,
protein chemistry, and a host of equally fundamental
topics. It means a community of scientific Interest within
Unilever, and continuity of academic contact outside It.
It can mean research as a career, or as an Introduction
to the technical and commercial sides of Unilever.
It can provide satisfaction in the pursuit of it and
financial reward in the success of It. There is only one
minor hazard. Our standards of acceptance are high.
We Invite you to write to Dr. A. CROSSLEY, Staff Officer,
Research Div., Unilever Ltd., Unilever House, London, E.C.4

Perhaps you have seen various
posters around College advertis-
ing an Overseas Service Week
from Feb. 11th to 15th. What is
this Overseas Service Week all
about ?
The idea was thought of last
session by David Prentis, a third
year mathematician, and he
passed it on to me before leaving
College in the Summer. I found
that the idea quickly gained sup-
port from many people, both staff
and students, and so during last
term a group of students came to-
gether to get on with the job of
organising O.S.W. It was only
then that we discovered that
many other Universities have
already held weeks very similar
to the one we are planning.
The aim of O.S.W. is not to
drain this country of rts scientists
and engineers, but to present all
the opportunities for working
abroad. The developing countries
need qualified people ; they need
people who will work in govern-
ment posts, go abroad with pri-
vate companies, or spend a year
after graduating working over-
seas with voluntary organisa-
tions. This sort of work can de-
velop your character and give you
chances of experience and re-
sponsibility which cannot be
found in the security of Great
Britain. During the O.S.M., ex-
perts will talk about conditions
abroad and the channels through
which jobs are filled.
I hope that many I.C. students
will want to find out more about
this sort of work. During the
week there will be an information
centre in Committee Room B
which will be open from 12.30
p.m. to 7.0 p.m. every day. There
you will be able to obtain details
of every type of work available
in the developing countries. If
you haven't yet seriously con-
sidered going abroad when you
leave I.C., then Overseas Service
Week is the time to start thinking
about it.
