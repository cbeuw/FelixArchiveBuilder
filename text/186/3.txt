B R O W N BAGGERS
During the week Sunday, Feb.
3rd—40th, a number of " brown-
baggers "—-Franciscan friars and
nuns who wear brown habits—•
will invade Imperial College.
They will be assisted by a band
of priests, laymen and laywomen.
A large number of our students
have consented to entertain these
visitors to meals and coffee. This
is to enable us to meet them and
to introduce them to our friends.
They are quite normal and ap-
proachable—in fact quite human!
Do try to get a chance to meet
them. Apart from these in-
formal opportunities of meeting,
two of the friars will be speaking
at the G E N E R A L STUDIES on
the subject of " On Being a
Christian To-day." Both these
friars—Fr. Dennis Marsh, S.S.F.,
and Fr Hugh, S.S.F., are distin-
guished academics as well as able
directors in the spiritual life. A n
opportunity to hear them should
not be missed. These General
Studies are on Tuesday, February
t5h, and Thursday, February
7th, and will take place in Room
254, Chem. Eng. Building. On
Monday, February 4th, a talk on
the " Franciscan Life," and on
Friday, February 8th, a Forum
will be held in Aero Building,
Room 254.
Every morning at 8.30 a ser-
vice of holy communion will be
held in the concert hall. On
Thursday, February 7th, a SUNG
EUCHARIST will be celebrated
by the Bishop of Kensington,
during which he will also baptise
a student of the Royal College
of Music and confirm her and live
men from Imperial. The service
will take place in St. Augustine's
Church, Queen's Gate, S.W.7,
which is the University church
for the area. A gala party will
follow the service and this will be
held in the Imperial College
Snack Bar.
The Snack Bar will also be the
setting for the three evening talks
on " The Faith " which will be
given on the Monday, Tuesday,'
Wednesday of the week. They
will begin at 8.0 p.m. and be over
by 9.0 p.m. They will be given
by the leader of the campaign,
Fr. Bernard, S.S.F.
Fr. Bernard will also preach on
both Sundays of the week. On
both Sundays the services in St.
Augustine's will be a SUNG EU-
CHARIST at 9.0 a.m. and
EVENSONG and SERMON at
7.30 p.m.
I have tried to give an outline
of the campaign and I know from
all I have come to expect from
you that you will give our visitors
a great welcome and will work
hard to make their stay among us
a worthwhile one.
Every good wish.

Now that we are approaching
Half Session, this is an appro-
priate time to review the activi-
ties of the Union over the last
four months. The six Freshers
Dinners, that is including the one
taken over from Master Harris,
set the scene for a term full of
activity and surprises.
Mitch, by permission of un-
known Guildsmen, appeared at
the first; and at the second,
Theta appeared too, having been
presented to us a few days earlier
by its negligent keepers. It is
many years since one college has
been custodian of all three mas-
cots—yet another record ! The
300 or so at the second meeting
must remember Harriss' feebly
attempted song and dance re-
quired of him to secure the re-
turn of his Broom Handle and
Lavatory Ball Cock.
In the more classically sporting
sphere, Guilds has further
shown its prowess in rowing,
swimming and cross country run-
ning. Morphy Day was a clean
sweep, both the Morphy and
Lowry pots have been won and
thanks to the hard fought sup-
port of all those on the towpath
Chris Liddle kept his trousers.
Under his direction the Battle of
the Bags was also clinched.
The Swimming Gale too de-
monstrated the present supremacy
of the college for the swimming
and polo were yet again won out-
right. One defeat we must re-
cord however is the Presidents'
Race. A Chandmal Ind. Imp.
clad only in a brief swimming
costume scored a tactical success
over Chris who had brought
along Mae West, air bed, paddle
and rope—better luck next time,
Old Man.
Almost at the end of term the
Cross Country Club chalked up
success against Mines and R.C.S.
Term ended in the same way
as it probably started for most—
with a drink ! Some 30 or so
revellers set off by tube for the
U.L. Bar armed perchance with
a Charity Carnival collecting box.
The tubes were an ideal location
for carol singing, to the involun-
tary audience a couple of bob
was a cheap silence. By near to
closing time the choir had re-
turned to Knightsbridge with over
£6 crammed, a worthy effort.
Such a successful term cannot
be explained away by the saying
" Guilds is much the largest Col-
lege." The reason is much more
fundamental for as the Dean has
said, Guilds is superior to the
other colleges.
The present crest of the wave
is not maintained by relying on
past successes but by the very
positive contribution being made
by many keen Guildsmen led by
the President. Chris's enthusiasm
and sincerity is felt by all those
active in his Union.
AN
OPEN
INVITATION
The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU — and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
