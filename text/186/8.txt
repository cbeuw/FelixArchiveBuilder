ing countries to work as volun-
teers. It is a fact that last year
someone was sent to join two
others in Bolivia, fares paid and
wages supplemented by NUS.
(This information has been ob-
tained from a very authoritative
source). The object is to halt
illiteracy and raise money for
schools in Bolivia. It could be
argued that we are simply spend-
ing our money in providing free
holidays for NUS personnel.

There is the matter of NUS
politics. The National Union in
Britain is a member of the Inter-
national Students' Conference
which was formed in opposition
to the Communist dominated IUS.
NUS supports students in their
campaign against apartheid in
South Africa, it supported the
raising of funds for Hungarian
student refugees, it has sent food
and clothing to Algeria. A cyclo-
styled announcement was re-
ceived recently in the Union, sent
by the Coordinating Secretariat
of National Unions. This was a
four page diatribe against the
constitution of Southern Rhodesia
(put out by the Zimbawe Stu-
dents Union, 4, Inverness Ter-
race, London, W.2). NUS also
support motions like that of soli-
darity with Puerto Rican stu-
dents.
Should our Union, as members
of NUS, be implicated in the
actions and resolutions of a con-
ference we have hardly any
chance of influencing ? The pub-
lic image of IC will not be
affected, in the opinion of the
pro-NUS faction, because the
public don't even know that at
the moment we are not members.
Another point to be raised is
the composition of NUS. Since
this has a heavy Tech. College
membership, it is not certain that
all their actions would be of bene-
fit to University students. Last
year, NUS tried to force the Uni-
versities to refuse a gift of
£10,000 from the Vice-Chan-,
cellor for University sport, on the
grounds that a similar subsidy
should have been made to the
Training Colleges. (This infor-
mation comes from an authorita-

itself, you will remember that in
a previous article it was said that
£15,000 to £20,000 out of
£40,000 are spent in salaries for
the staff who administer the re-
maining funds. In the balance
sheet of the Accounts dated 31st
December, 1961, the figures are
£28,000 out of £354,000. A
healthy surplus is being built up,
and the financial side of NUS
looks good, with an annual in-
come of £354,000 made up of
affiliation fees (about 50 per
cent.), donations, trusts, etc., NUS
accounts, contrary to rumours,
are published and are freely avail-
able.
In spite of the g6od grace of
the Editor who gave me a carte
blanche for this article (and a big
one at that), I could not possibly
discuss all the salient arguments

We must not forget the finan-
cial aspect of the situation. In-
dividual members of NUS get
certain concessions on some arti-
cles. Barring a few firms, any
IC Union member could get the
same concessions (this fact should
have no bearing on which way
you vote—you should decide as
a member of ICU not as John
Smith). There is no doubt what-
soever that the NUS travel de-
partment is first rate and will
save you an appreciable amount
should you decide to travel
abroad. It is possible to join as
an individual member for the
sum of 15/-.
The more relevant argument
revolves around the point that if
we join, the ICU will have to
find a " spare " £300. Where will
this money come from and at
what cost ? £300 represent 2\
per cent, of our income. Since
the Union fees cannot be raised
for some years to corne, this
money must either come out of
reserves (£8,000 not counting the
Bookstall reserves), or by cutting
the grants to the clubs, or by cut-
ting out the Presidents' Ball. The
Union should appreciate just
what joining means to us finan-
cially, and the proposers should
make it quite clear from where
the money is coming.
As for the finances of the NUS
ments, drama, Festival, summer
camps and jobs, all well known
to us.
I have given you some facts, all
checked and rechecked, which
seem to me to be the most im-
portant. No doubt you will hear
these and others at the Union
Meeting. The decision will be
yours, gentlemen. 1 feel strongly
that, given the facts, the Union
meeting is the best judge of what
is best for this Union. Collective
judgment is the basis of demo-
cracy, and I am in favour of it.
I have been pressed to "give a
lead " by committing myself but
have refused to do so because as
President, one does not come
across enough evidence to decide
the issue clearly. This is borne
out by the fact that I personally
know two men, ex-Presidents of
ICU who hold diametrically op-
posite views on this subject.
Your decision will be based on
your attitude to things, material
and moral, and this is after all a
very personal thing.
One final word. We are very
grateful to the RGS for giving us
the use of their Hall. Please bear
this in mind, and don't behave in
any way that may affect the
Union adversely.
And do come to what promises
to be an Historic Union Meeting.
