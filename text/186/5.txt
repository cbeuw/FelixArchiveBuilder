CARNIVAL QUEEN
Our first two contenders for
the Carnival Queen crown are
pictured above. The winner will
receive (in addition, of course, to
the accolades of all Imperial Col-
lege at the crowning ceremony),
a ticket to the May Ball.' (Ru-
mours that the first prize also in-
cludes a weekend in Paris with
the President of R.C.S. are en-
tirely unfounded. Good try,
Mike !)
We have got off to a very good
start indeed, but we still need
lots more nominations ; so, gen-
tlemen, write and tell us about
the girl you think ought to be
1963 s I.C. Carnival Queen.
Nominations to Graham B.
White, Carnival Office.
RAFFLE TICKETS
The envelopes for the Carni-
val Raffle tickets will be distri-
buted shortly. Their early return
would be a great help to those
organising the raffle, so please
address them and return them as
soon as possible.
COMMANDO GROUPS ...
More information about the
Commando Groups mentioned in
the last Carnival Page. We want
people who are prepared to don
odd clothes and wave collecting
tins at wealthy-looking queues of
people—e.g. outside the Albert
Hall, or outside Theatres and
Cinemas. These groups have, in
the past, wheedled, cajoled or
scared considerable sums out of
people waiting in queues, and we
can jse just as many people as we
can get for this jjob. No previous
experience necessary; great variety
of scene ; and you meet lots of
people ; in fact, the ideal way to
pass an evening ; so if you are
interested, hand in your name at
the Carnival Office, and we can
arrange times and places nearer
to the Carnival.
Commandos are also needed
for the Vice Squads, the Dreaded
League of Bill-Stickers who
yearly make certain that no per-
son living anywhere near the Car-
nival Route can possibly fail to
notice that I.C. Carnival is upon
them once more.
These fleet-footed phantoms
strike quickly, armed only with
paste-pot and posters, but the re-
sults of their handiwork are plain
for all the world to see. So, To
Arms, ye yeoman of I.C.! Hand
in your name at the Carnival
Office—and prepare for battle !
CARNIVAL
QUESTIONNAIRE

College Carnival is YOUR Carni-
val, and we want YOUR ideas
on how to make it a success. So,
before you go on to the next bit
of the Carnival Page (it isn't very
interesting anyway, just a list of
the Carnival Committee mem-
bers, and who cares; apart of
course from the Carnival Com-
mittee members), FILL IN T H E
QUESTIONNAIRE, and return
it as soon as you can to the Union
Office, or to the Carnival Office.

Carnival Queen 1963.

Description of subject:
Height: 165 cm.
Weight: 55 kg.
Vital statistics : 85, 62, 90 cms.
Hair: Brunette.
Eyes : Grey.
Complexion : Depends on time

Case history : Home town is
Pontefract, Yorkshire. Born of
two parents, one male and one
female, and attended Wakefield
Girls' School (but went to the
boys' school for Physics lessons).
At I.C. she captains the ICWA

of Stynx and Felix, plays hockey
and goes horse-riding.
She was last seen alone, wear-
ing a short, green, lamb's wool
coat, with a man(?) in her room.
Study the photo of this Wanted
ICWArian carefully, she prob-
ably sold you your copy of Felix !
If you have any information of
her whereabouts, contact the
Carnival Queen Selection Com-
mittee, so that they may judge
her for themselves.
There is no doubt in my mind
that she is the most eligible girl,
and therefore I demand the maxi-
mum penalty.

I.C. Prosecutor.
JENNIFER CHAPMAN
The election of Jenny Chap-
man as I.C. Carnival Queen 1963
would give us not only a gay and
glamourous figure-head for our
Carnival Week functions, but
would be a fitting recognition of
the tremendous otherwise selfless
effort she will again be making
towards the Carnival preparation.
Jenny is an ICWArian who soon
realised that she could never do
enough for the college whilst not
living here, and so now she has a
room in Beit Hostel.
This 24hr. a day presence in the
Union precincts is put to good
use, and she seldom rests from
her ardours on behalf of one or
other of the several societies of
which she is an active member.
A second year Zoology student,
her years and wisdom are above
those of her fellows due to the
transitory period she spent earn-
ing her living as Veterinary Ento-
mologist, handling parasitic flies
and ticks. Her refined and femi-
nine nature did not suffer by this
however any more than it has
done since she left her Mother
at home in Hertfordshire and
came to the Big City.
She has a talent for organising
which is happily combined with
a generous nature so that she is
often much over-burdened with
work apart from study. But
nothing gives her more satisfac-
tion than to do a thing herself,
and from this point of view we
should feel lucky that she is
around at a time when we need
just such a person.
Jenny's willingness to help
should not be misconstrued, and
T call uoon every Union mem-
ber to show their approval that
Jennifer Chapman should help
our 1963 by taking office as the
most competent ever Carnival
Oueen.
