10 things you need to know if you cycle in London
So, you’re new to London. Or maybe you’ve been here a while but you’re looking for a way to save some money,
stay healthy, and just have fun. Or maybe you need a plan now that Uber are potentially on the rocks... Here is a
totally incomprehensive list of how to stay safe and enjoy cycling in London…

1. The Bike
If you are going to
be cycling regularly in
London, Boris bikes aren’t
really a feasible solution.
The best thing about
buying a bike for London
is that it’s flat! This opens
up a huge range of possi-
bilities in terms of what
you buy. My personal
recommendation is to get
yourself a single speed or
cheap road/hybrid bike,
from a reputable company.
2. Helmets
Just wear one. Trust me.
3. Locks
So you have your
dream bike in London that
looks super cool, and you
can’t wait to tear up the
cycle superhighways, but
this is all going to be very
short-lived if you don’t get
proper locks. A general
rule of thumb for London
is to have two locks: a
D-lock (the university
security does a pretty good
deal on these) for your
frame and back wheel, and
a cable lock for your front
wheel and saddle (yes
people in London steal
saddles, it sucks).
4. Punctures
These suck. Well…
blow. The last thing you
want when you’re rushing
for your 9am lecture (ha)
or labs is to get a puncture
and be stood on the side
of the road with no way
to get where you’re going.
Firstly, learn how to mend
a puncture. Secondly,
get some tougher tires.
I like going quickly as
much as the next person,
but a slightly tougher tire
won’t slow you down
much on your commute.
Get some GatorSkins or
some Schwalbe Mara-
thons – they are genuinely
amazing and will fend
off all but the toughest
London junk.
5. What to wear
For those of you how
didn’t already know, it
rains. A lot. Get a cycling
jacket. They are water-
proof, can be scrunched
into the smallest pocket of
any bag, and light enough
so that you don’t get super
sweaty on your way to uni.
Get a fluorescent one: they
“I don’t want
to be killed by
a driver who
hates cyclists
because you
couldn’t stop
for a light to
turn green ”
“For those
of you how
didn’t already
know, it rains.
A lot. Get a
waterproof
cycling jacket.”
make a huge difference
on how visible you are at
night. They are a tad pricey
(£60) but Proviz Reflect is
a really good jacket and it
is kinda trendy.
6. Lights
On the subject of being
seen: please don’t cheap
out on lights. London is
so well lit at night that
crummy lights just won’t
be visible at night, at all.
For front lights, you should
be looking at something
like the Exposure Switch
or the Cateye Volt 800. For
backlights, something like
the Exposure TraceR rear
bike light or the Bontrager
Flare R rear light are really
good options. The other
light I would seriously
suggest getting is a light
for your rucksack, the
iQualTech Backpack light
is not a replacement for a
proper backlight but is a
really cheap (£10) way to
help you be more visible
at night.
7. Learn to fix
your own bike
You’ve managed to get
yourself into university,
you can definitely learn
how to fix a bike. There
are several bits of basic
maintenance you can
easily teach yourself and
carry out with a basic bike
multi-tool, and the Global
Cycling Network has
some really good videos
online that take you step
by step on how to fix pretty
much any problem with
your bike. Alternatively,
befriend someone who
knows how to fix bikes…
8. Don’t be a dick
Cycling in London gets
a bad rep for being really
dangerous, and part of
that is the attitude of some
drivers towards cyclists.
These drivers are, thank-
fully, in the minority at
the moment but they seem
to be growing. The big
driver of this anti-cyclist
sentiment is that there is
an unfortunate number
of cyclists who have no
regard for the rules of the
road. So: stop at red lights
and zebra crossings; signal
before you turn; don’t
cycle on pavements; when
available, use cycle paths;
and please please please
don’t go up the inside of
cars or buses when lane
splitting. I don’t want to
be killed by some driver
who hates cyclists because
you couldn’t wait for a
light to go green.
9. It’s not all
doomandgloom
If you read the papers
you would be forgiven for
thinking that if you cycle
in London you will die.
Now, I know it’s a bit rich
coming from someone
who has been hit cycling,
but it really isn’t that
dangerous. There is loads
of guidance online on how
to cycle safely in London,
like The London Cyclist
website.
10. Have fun
Cycling should be an
enjoyable experience. It is
such a good way to learn
the city and see parts of
London that you would
miss on the tube.
If you like your road
cycling then you can join
ICU Cycling Club and
explore some of the Surrey
or Windsor countryside.
