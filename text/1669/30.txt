Everyone should take up sports at Imperial – your clubs
need you!
Going to university gives you a perfect opportunity to try out something you’ve never done before. You should dive
in both feet first, and give the sports clubs a go!

I
’ll be the Sports
Editor for Felix
2017/18, and want
to encourage you to
try sport. With 60+ sports
clubs to choose from
its often hard to figure
out what sport you’d be
interested in trying. From
sports that require more of
a soft touch rather than a
hard hit, that are team or
individual, or more social
than hardcore training. It’s
often hard for incoming
(or returning) students
to figure out what to try
when surrounded with so
many options. After play-
ing 3 years of American
Football (in Edinburgh
and Kent, reaching the
British Championships
for the first time in each
of the teams’ histories) I
was delighted to find that
Imperial had their own
team. I was very keen, and
emailed prior to starting
at Imperial, making sure
to free up the appropriate
trial day. When my time
at Imperial did start it was
madness, fresher’s week is
still somewhat of a blurry
recollection. I never did
attend that initial training
session. A classic fresher’s
trip to Ministry (or a halls/
union event, I can’t really
remember) left me rather
rough and irritated at the
even the prospect of going
outdoors.
I did manage to trial
another day, and have
played for two years with
the team. I have played, or
at least tried, most sports
throughout high school
“Even if you
don’t want to
take sport too
seriously you
can participate
in super fun
social teams” “I have met
many people
who have
regretted not
taking up
sport earlier at
Imperial”
in and of itself should
encourage the reader to
pursue physical endeav-
ours. For sports in particu-
lar, I have met a lot more
people who have regretted
not taking up sport earlier,
than people who were
despondent after realising
the sport wasn’t for them.
I should note it is rare
to have prior university
American Football experi-
ence in the Imperial team.
That is the same with most
Imperial teams (especially
so with less mainstream
sports). Do not be afraid
to try new sports if you
haven’t done it before.
Sports clubs want you to
come along and develop
you into an athlete. Even
if you don’t want to take
sport too seriously you can
participate in social teams
which are super fun too!
To get a most complete
experience of university
I would argue that doing
sport is a necessity.
With regards to the
Medics and IC clubs, there
is only a limited amount
of guidance I can give. I
know that medics can join
IC clubs, and vice versa.
As to why to choose one
club over the other when
they do the same sport, I
am less sure... Committees
change, coaches change,
opinions change, so what I
say is try out the clubs. If
you find one of the clubs is
too socially orientated and
you want to be more sport
orientated then try the
other club, and vice versa.
If you are in a medic club
you will find yourself
usually in Reynolds for
sports night, whilst IC
teams will find themselves
in the Union. That’s about
it...
If you are interested
in going for a team trial
see the timetable extract
below. The trials are jam-
packed into one day. If you
find yourself unable attend
get in contact with the club
and they will probably
have other sessions.
