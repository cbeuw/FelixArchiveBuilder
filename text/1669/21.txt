Gaiman’s London is never where you think it is

N
eil Gaiman has
an uncanny
knack for
picking out the
essence of a place.
In American Gods,
Gaiman weaved the battle
between ancient gods
and modern greed into an
epic tale of contemporary
America. Neverwhere, in
my opinion, should be read
by everyone who lives
in London. Richard, the
protagonist, moves south
from Scotland to work in
the city, but by a stroke
of fate entangles himself
with London Below, an
alternative London where
the night is dangerous on
Knightsbridge and monks
clad in black roam through
Blackfriars. The monthly
‘floating market’, where
the myriad characters of
London Below sell and
exchange their wares and
services, was held on the
HMS Belfast.
London Below is
inhabited by talking rats,
assassins and bodyguards
for hire, and a girl called
Door that Richard saves,
who can, well, open doors
to the remotest of places.
The jealous villain is the
majestic Angel called
Islington.
At first glance, one
might think that this is a
cheesy fantasy story that
takes tube stations literally
and makes a story out of
puns. In fact, Gaiman’s
genius is in distilling the
heart of London from
lighthearted references.
After three years in
London, Richard observes
that the city is ‘filled with
colour’.
‘It was a city in which
the very old and the awk-
wardly new jostled each
other, not uncomfortably,
but without respect...a city
of hundreds of districts
with strange names -
Crouch End, Chalk Farm,
Earl’s Court, Marble
Arch - and oddly distinct
identities.’
London Below is
simply the essence of this
incredible juxtaposition
and diversity blown up
in a fantastical setting.
But, as Richard observes
after he chooses to return
to London Above, which
world is, in fact, reality?
The monotony of his life
in London Above, the
one with work worries,
relationship troubles
and the eternal struggle
to hail a black cab after
midnight, stood out more
strongly than ever after
his adventures in London
Below. As he passes by an
elderly homeless lady on
the street, he tells her:
‘I thought I wanted a
nice normal life. I mean,
maybe I am crazy. I mean,
maybe. But if this is all
there is, then I don’t want
to be sane. You know?’
Indeed, for the reader,
Neverwhere is an adven-
ture that one does not come
back from unchanged and
unmoved. For one, every
stop on the tube map now
holds a special signifi-
cance. As I pass through
Earl’s Court, I cannot help
but think of the scene of
Richard meeting the Earl
in his tube ‘palace’ at the
station, or the shepherds
of Shepherd’s Bush.
There is magic in seeing
stories beneath everyday
places and people, that
extra sparkle that keeps us
connected and wondrous
of our surroundings.
London’s diversity, its
amalgamation of the old
and new, is fertile ground
for imagination. To the
freshers, take your time to
explore this vibrant city,
and may you be touched
by the magic around you.
And don’t forget to give
Neverwhere a go.
Neverwhere draws from the magic of London and puts it all in one place.
