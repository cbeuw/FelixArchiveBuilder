Stretching your student loan: cinema on a budget
Felix’s guide to how to see the most films with the least money, at the cheapest cinemas London has to offer
5. Picturehouse Cinema – £5 Matinee; £7 Weekdays
When you think of
cinema chains, you think
of overpriced popcorn at
Odeon, or £15 tickets at
Vue, but Picturehouses
breaks the mold. Located
in some of the most archi-
tecturally unique buildings
in London, Picturehouses
spreads from the Ritzy
Theatre in Central Brixton,
to the centre of Piccadilly
Circus, to just across the
park from Imperial at the
Gate, Notting Hill. There
is no shortage of them,
but they definitely do not
fall short on cheap tickets,
comfy seats and great
venues in great locations.
Picturehouse Central
offers the slightly more
premium budget option,
but still cheap on weekday
matinees. The best place
to impress a date or just
give yourself a little taste
of the life of luxury.
Nearest Station: Notting
Hill Gate / Brixton / Hackney
Wick
Alongside all the
IMAXs and the Vues/
Empires/Odeons, down
a dingy alley lies undis-
putedly one of London’s
greatest cult icons, the
Prince Charles. Still
proudly showing its Time
Out best cinema 2008
on its door, the Prince
Charles is home to not
only screenings of the
latest blockbusters, but
daily screenings of cult
classics, alongside unique
events. With monthly
Mean Girls Bitch-a-longs,
Frozen Sing-a-longs, all
night pyjama parties and
screenings of the greatest
cinema ever produced,
The Room. Prince Charles
Cinema is a place where
you are expected to throw
spoons at the screen, and
shout ‘On Wednesdays we
wear pink!’ and enjoy film
to a level you’ve never
experienced before.
Nearest Station: Leicester
Square
Located right next
door to Shoreditch and in
the middle of one of the
most evolving areas of
London, Genesis in East
London has always been
a personal favourite of
mine. Surrounded by hip
bars and pop up restau-
rants, with dirtily cheap £5
afternoon tickets, a multi-
tude of both blockbuster,
arthouse, experimental,
international and premiere
screenings all week, and
an extra special set of
screens with sofas so
comfy they’ll make you
weep even if you’re not
watching The Notebook,
Genesis Cinema has it all.
Nearest Station: Peckham
Rye
If you’re looking to
broaden your horizons and
explore the true arthouse
scene of London look no
further, with showings
of some of the best con-
tenders in the arthouse
and international film
world, ICA definitely has
a lot going for it with its
as cheap as £3 tickets in
the afternoons and great
location only a few stops
away from Imperial. ICA
is also hosting a plethora
of events over the next
couple weeks as part of
BFI London Film Festival,
so it’s definitely worth
checking out.
Nearest Station: Picadilly
Circus
In the heart of one of the
most culturally rich areas
of south London, take a
journey across the river
to undoubtedly the best
cinema deal any day of the
week. The Peckham Plex
£5 ticket all day every day
policy is still going strong
with no signs of price rise,
so bag yourself a block-
buster on the mega cheap,
and while you’re at it get
a taste of the hippest new
area of London.
Nearest Station: Peckham
