Imperial overrun with mysterious infestation

unexpected parasitic
outbreak has overrun

T
he infestation,
which seemed
to have started
earlier this
week, is of a new strain
of Homo undergraduus,
colloquially referred to
as ‘Freshers’. It is be-
lieved that ground zero
of the outbreak is Beit
Quadrangle, although
since then the infestation
has spread to a number
of sites across west Lon-
don, including the Junior
Common Room, Imperi-
al Library’s second floor,
and Woodward Halls in
Acton. It is unclear the
extent of the spread,
but experts believe that
only the ‘Blue Cube’
Faculty Building and
the Business School are
completely unaffected.
Last Monday, Nick
Smith, newly-appoint-
ed Vice Provost (Pest
Control), spoke briefly to
the media whilst dressed
in biohazard protective
gear. He urged those
listening that everything
was “business as usual”,
and called for calm, before
making a hasty retreat into
the hermetically-sealed
Blue Cube, which has
been on lockdown for the
past week.
In a follow up statement
from Imperial communi-
cations, a representative
from the College said
“Problems? What prob-
lems? Absolutely nothing
is wrong. Have you seen
how well we did in the
Good University Guide by
the way?’
However, internal
documents that were
leaked to Felix reveal that
the College has begun a
radical fight back against
the infestation, and are
planning on hiring exter-
minators to forcibly move
the infestation to White
City. The plan, “Proposal
for Removal Of Freshers
In Totality” – nicknamed
PROFIT – involves con-
struction of a new contain-
ment site in the wastelands
of Zone 2; the nature of the
project is unclear, but the
proposal seems to suggest
that the infestation can be
domesticated using some-
thing called the ‘Imperial
White City Incubator’.
The proposal says that
when the new site has been
built, “Imperial staff will
be able to go about their
daily business of produc-
ing world-class research in
peace, without having to
worry about petty things
like NSS scores or cooked
breakfasts”. The project
will be overseen by Vice
Provost (PROFIT Driver),
a role that has not yet been
assigned.
One academic, who
asked not to be named, told
Felix about their narrow
escape: “I was packing
up my stuff, getting ready
to leave the office, when
suddenly the door was
blocked by two of the crea-
tures. They started asking
me questions about the
‘undergraduate syllabus’,
and ‘reading lists’ – I had
no idea what they were
saying, but it all sounded
very intimidating. Luckily
our department has got a
new student-staff liaison
officer, so I was able
to point them down the
corridor and they left as I
made my escape. Was the
sacrifice worth it? I don’t
know. I just know I’m
going to be haunted by my
decision for the rest of my
life.”
Another staff member
was considering putting in
a complaint to occupation-
al health: “I have lots of
allergies, so I can’t work
in areas that places with
too much damp, dust, or
people who don’t know
what Reynold’s Transport
Theorem is”
Ada Harrington, chair
of Environmental Protec-
tion UK, a charity offering
policy advice on environ-
mental law, called for Im-
perial College to become
a Special Area of Conser-
vation (SAC), and receive
governmental protection.
“It’s really important that
higher education institu-
tions recognise the value
such organisms provide
for biodiversity,” she said,
“establishing an SAC at
Imperial would show that
the university provides a
safe environment, not only
for world-class research
and business leaders,
but also for those on the
bottom of the food chain,
such as undergraduate
materials students”.

This week, you cancel
summer for everybody,
and face legal action.
99% of your flights aren’t
arriving on time, but at
least 50% of your flights
are arriving?
This week, you finally
hear back from your
supervisor. After fifteen
long, pleading emails sent
about yout project, you
get a response. “Sure!
Sent from my iPhone”
This week, you move
into halls and decide to
continue your sixth-form
relationship long distance.
It’s doomed and you’ll be
heartbroken. Sorry.
This week you
make it to Imperial.
Congratulations –
welcome to the 3rd best
university in the country.
Oh, you’re in the physics
department? Good luck
with that.
This week you find
yourself in the political
mainstream. “Let’s hope
the whole of the country
is infected!” you cry.
(Your cries following
your pathology results are
shockingly similar).
This week it’s time to
let loose and socialise,
before the moon returns
to your career sector.
And by ‘moon’ we mean
the never-ending pile up
of problem sheets and
coursework assignments.
This week you’re the
Felix editor. Inspired
by the life and times of
Hugh Hefner, you put a
naked centrefold in your
paper. Next week you’re
inspired by the life and
times of Hugh Hefner.
This week you’re fresh
meat. Welcome to the
grinder! Your department
mums and dads start
gambling how long you’ll
last, but you’ve dropped
out already. Don’t worry –
your secret’s safe with us.
This week you finally
get around to sorting
out your loans and
finances. You decide
home student sounds too
boring, and international
matches your outlook and
philosophy much better.
Oops.
This week you go to
the Union. You fail to
strawpedo a VK, but
work out how to get the
blue vomit. Swings and
roundabouts – you came
to university to learn.
This week you decide:
New year, new you! You
resolve henceforth to be
the best you can possibly
be. Unfortunately, that
isn’t very good.
This week you’re
thrilled to hear the news
that Twitter will increase
the character limit to
280, allowing you to
share your deep thoughts.
Unfortunately, nobody
cares what you have to
say.

Returning student insists this year he’s ‘doing things
right’.
C
hris Connoley,
a third-year bi-
ology student,
has made a
public declaration of his
commitment to working
harder and being more
organised, saying that
‘this year will be differ-
ent’.
Connoley, who had
been scraping by on a low
2:2 since arriving at Impe-
rial for a BSc in Biology
two years ago, made the
surprise announcement to
a group of friends during
a get together in 568 just
before the beginning of
the new academic year.
In a shocking statement,
Connoley explained that
his decision to learn to play
the guitar over the summer
rather than applying for
competitive internships
has really given him “time
to think”, and that he had
come to the conclusion
that – now being nearly
twenty-five grand in debt
– this was going to be “his
year”.
When asked about his
new schedule by Felix,
Connoley explained
“yeah, I’m definitely
going to start studying
for an hour each evening,
that way I’ll be well
prepared when finals roll
around. Well, except for
on Wednesdays, that’s
sports night. And some
Fridays I’m going to go to
Reynolds for their bops.
Oh, and ski trip is coming
up. But apart from that I’m
gonna be fully committed
to my degree.”
A couple of pints down
at this point, Connoley
then made a trip to the
Kensington High Street
branch of Rymans, where
he spent nearly £60 on
new markers, post-it notes,
and a 2017-18 academic
diary. When asked about
his plans for the equip-
ment, Connoley said that
he was going to put them
in a desk draw at home
for ‘safekeeping’, and
definitely not completely
forget all about them until
mid-June.
One of his friends
spoke to Felix, telling us
that he was ‘amazed’ by
Connoley’s resolve: “To
be honest, it’s come as a
complete shock, but I have
total faith in Chris. I know
he said the same thing last
year, and the year before
that – I really think this
is going to be the year he
pulls through”.
