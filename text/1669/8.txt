orming groups
is a basic human
drive. You are
probably already
a member of many groups:
your family, your country,
and probably multiple
WhatsApp groups. But
how did we humans
become so social?
Researchers have long
studied the evolution
of social groups in bees
and birds. It seems their
complex societies evolved
slowly starting with single
individuals pairing off
or living with a few off-
spring. These small groups
then gradually grew larger
and more complicated, ul-
timately yielding complex
organizations. It could be
easily assumed the same
is true for primates - and
freshers. But Susanne
Shultz of the University of
Oxford and her colleagues
think this is probably not
that case.
They scanned the
scientific literature on
217 primate species and
noticed that closely related
species tended to organize
their societies in the same
way, no matter where they
lived. They ran a statistical
model to determine what
type of group the last
common ancestor to the

of 3.5 billion social media
posts from tens of millions
of individuals on both
Facebook and Twitter
between 2009 and 2016.
They did this by counting
the number of positive
and negative words each
post contained, assuming
that this was good proxy
for our mood. Then they
compared this to the daily
meteorological data from
each location. They found
a significant increase in
negative sentiment when
the weather was both too
cold or too hot and when
it was too wet, too humid,
and cloudy.

suggested that the solitary
ancestor started banding
together not in pairs, as
scientists had thought, but
as loose groups of both
sexes about 52 million
years ago. But not all of
today’s primates live in
large, mixed-sex groups.
A few live in exclusive
pairs and some, such as
gorillas, form harems.
Shultz’ analysis shows
that these social structures
showed up only about 16
million years ago.

group. And then after
some time, maybe by third
or fourth year, you might
have yourself a harem or
isolated yourself in an
exclusive relationship. If
this doesn’t appeal to you,

effect? To make a direct
comparison, the team
measured the change in
sentiment associated with
specific events - earth-
quakes and terror attacks.
And they found the change
in sentiment was of a
similar magnitude to that
associated with freezing
weather. From their results
weather appears not to
have a mild effect on
mood, but be a scorcher.
I
t would be pretty
easy to assume from
anecdotal evidence
that humans prefer
warm sunny days rather
than cold wet ones. But
what empirical evidence
is there for this? Patrick
Baylis and his colleagues
at Stanford University
have carried out the
largest investigation into
the relationship between
meteorological conditions
and mood. They did this
by analysing how the sen-
timent of geolocated social
media posts changed with
the weather.

Ants can only distinguish
between the basic kinds of
workers, such as soldiers
or the queen. Over its
life, it develops no friends
within its colony. The
bond of each ant is totally
