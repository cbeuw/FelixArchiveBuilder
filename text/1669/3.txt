Imperial overtakes Durham to claim fourth place in this
year’s Good University Guide
NEWS
The College has
improved on or
maintained its ranks
in all key metrics and
most of the subject
tables.

I
mperial has been
ranked fourth in The
Times and Sunday
Times Good Univer-
sity Guide 2018. This sees
the College rise one place
after overtaking Durham.
An analysis published
by Imperial cites improve-
ments in teaching quality
and student experience as
the main reasons for its
rise in the rankings. Out
of the 129 universities and
higher education institutes
included in the rankings,
Imperial is 104th for
teaching (up from 124th
last year) and 31st for
student experience (up
from 77th in 2017). Fol-
lowing last year’s results,
provost Professor James
Stirling promised to
address issues surrounding
feedback and assessments.
Vice-provost (education)
and inclusive teaching.
Our new Learning and
Teaching Strategy gives us
a clear framework to build
on our existing strengths
and drive the changes
that our students want and
need.
Of the 14 subject tables
Imperial appears in, it is
in the top three for nine.
This is a slight decrease
on last year. Ranks have
improved in six subjects
and fallen in four. Changes
here are again a result
of teaching and student
experience, boosting the
score for physics but
causing a drop for math-
ematics and chemistry. It
is worth noting that these
measures are relevant to
other universities. This
means Imperial fell in
the medicine rankings as
Edinburgh and Swansea
made improvements. The
remaining subjects have
maintained their positions
from last year, including
civil engineering and
geology, for which Im-
perial is top of the tables.
The College’s analysis
states that while being
generally outranked by
Oxford and Cambridge,
Imperial is still ahead of
UCL in both national and
subject rankings.
The results also indicate
that standards at Imperial
are higher this year. The
required 222 UCAS
points places Imperial
between Cambridge (230
points) and Oxford (221
points). Although Imperial
makes more offers than
Oxford and Cambridge,
competition is arguably
fiercer here. Applications
to Imperial were up six
per cent this year with an
application:place ratio of
7.6:1.
There is additional good
news for students nearing
the end of their studies:
Imperial has a 96.2 per
cent completion rate, with
88.6 per cent of students
achieving a first or 2:1.
At 41.8 per cent, Imperial
has the highest proportion
of graduates leaving with
a first-class degree of any
higher education institute
in the country. It will be
interesting to see how this
changes in future given
recent concerns about
grade inflation.
It gets better for grad-
uates. The median salary
for an Imperial graduate
was £30,000 — considera-
bly more than the average
£21,000 (though admit-
tedly not that much more
if you factor in London
living costs).
Imperial holds onto
second place for both
research quality and
graduate prospects, beaten
Translation and Innovation
Hub and the Molecular
Sciences Research Hub,
which will see researchers
begin work in 2018.
These general improve-
ments follow a fairly tu-
multuous year which saw
Imperial fall nine places
in the QS World Graduate
Employability Rankings,
place 8th in the Times
Higher Education global
rankings, and receive a
gold rating in the Teaching
Excellence Framework
(AKA the reason our
tuition fees have gone up
again).
Prior to that, research
conducted at Imperial
was judged to have the
greatest impact on society
and the economy than all
other UK universities in
the 2014 Research Excel-
lence Framework. Ninety
per cent of Imperial’s
research was also rated as
world-leading or interna-
tionally excellent.
Professor Buitendijk
said: “Our goals are am-
bitious and we know that
there is much work to do
but we are confident that
we can and will provide
the world-class education-
al experience our students
deserve.”
