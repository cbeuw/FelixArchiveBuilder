It’s that time of the year again...
Felix is recruiting!
We want you – yes, you!We’re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, reporters,
computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed – we’ll teach you
everything you need to know. If you’re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk
When I was elected
as Editor of Felix, a little
over six months ago, I set
myself one challenge: I
wouldn’t be writing my
first editorial the day of
the print deadline. I was
going to spend time over
it, painstakingly crafting
a loving piece of work
about my time at Imperial
thus far – a reflection of
the past five years I’ve
spent here. I was going to
wax lyrical about my own
experiences as a fresher,
looking back on how I
felt when I first walked
through the doors of
Gabor Hall, went up to my
room with my parents, and
then watched them wave
goodbye before making
the perilous trek back to
Tottenham. Who knows,
that editorial might even
have uncovered some uni-
versal truths about leaving
behind childhood things,
forging your own way in
the world, or seizing each
day as it comes.
But that was then, and
this is now: it’s 9pm,
an hour before the print
deadline for the first issue,
and I’m typing up these
words, powered by gallons
of Yorkshire tea and a
sinking feeling of anxiety
in my stomach. There will
be no searing truths, no
call to arms – instead I will
just share some advice to
those reading, many of
whom are about to embark
on their time at Imperial.
If I could have given
my younger self two
pieces of wisdom, the first
one would have been ‘you
do you’. During freshers’
week, it’s tempting to get
involved with absolutely
everything you can, even
if you’re not particularly
keen on playing ring of
fire for the umpteenth
time. It’s natural to feel
this way – you want to
make friends, to be seen
as someone who knows
how to have fun. But you
shouldn’t be afraid of
doing what you want: go
to the cinema alone; go
around the V&A in your
lunch break; have some
solitary time if you feel
that’s what you need.
The second piece
of advice I would give
myself would be ‘don’t
be afraid to get involved’.
By this I don’t mean sign
up to every club you can
at Freshers’ fair (although
I’m sure this will be true
– I’m still getting emails
from Cheese Soc), but
rather ensure that if there’s
something you’re interest-
ed in you pursue it with
determination.
It’s a mistake I made
with Felix. As a fresher I
wrote for the Arts section
nearly every single week,
a habit that continued
into my second year, as I
branched out into Music
and Film. I wanted to
get more involved, to get
placed on the editorial
team, but I thought that if
I just waited they would
eventually ask me to join.
Now I’m on the other
side, I can most definitely
assure you that this is not
the case. We are always
completely desperate for
writers and editors, for
people who are willing
to give up their valuable
time, sit down, and create
what you are holding.
After applying to edit
the Arts section, I was
given a glimpse behind the
curtain, and what I found
was not a group of intim-
idating hacks, competing
with each other for the
juiciest scoop, but rather
some of the warmest and
most welcoming people
I’ve ever met. The people
I’ve met through Felix
have become my lifelong
friends, my family, and the
Felix office has become
like my home. Barely a
day goes past when I’m
not glad that I made the
plunge. So get stuck in,
you never know where it
might lead – maybe in a
few years it will be you
writing these words.
Oh, and call your mum.
She probably misses you.
