Foodie’s Guide to South Kensington
Let’s face it, Imperial is situated in one of the most expensive areas of London. But being in the know about cheap
places to go means that eating well in South Ken doesn’t need to break your bank balance.

W
ith Freshers’
week going
on in full
s w i n g ,
there’s bound to be a
moment when you’re a
little bit too weak to go
near the stove and dish out
your perfectly organised,
healthy and affordable
meal plans. Or maybe
you just need somewhere
to go with your new
friends without becoming
financially crippled. Been
there, done that.
We’re university
students, which means
that most of us are per-
petually broke. Here are
some of the places your
well-seasoned seniors
visited during times of
hardship, torture, and self-
doubt during their time at
Imperial.
My Old Dutch
Pancakes are the answer
to everything! Well, not
everything, but most
things.This pancake house
on Kensington Church
Street prides itself on
serving gigantic pancakes,
both savoury and sweet.
One pancake usually costs
£8 to £12 and the portion
is generous. What’s better:
every Monday, excluding
specified items on the
menu, all sweet and
savoury pancakes will cost
£5.95. On other days, you
can also get 10% off your
bill with your student card!
Note that the Monday
Madness promotion is
not applicable on Bank
holidays and optional
service charge applies.
Vegetarian options avail-
able.
Dozo
A small Japanese res-
taurant just a few minutes
away from South Kens-
ington station, you might
miss it altogether if not for
the queue snaking out of
its door during lunchtime.
The tasteful decoration
inside carries a heavy
note of traditional Japan,
what with their futon seats
and low tables. The most
student-popular order
will be their lunch menu,
with a variety of mains to
choose from, ranging from
bento to sushi set. Each
set costs £7.90 and comes
with a cup of warm green
tea. Note that there will be
a service charge and the
queue can be quite long
during lunchtime. Perfect
if you have a long lunch
break or a free afternoon.
Bella Italia
Bella Italia is an Italian
restaurant with franchise
all over the UK and
its website is regularly
updated with the latest
promotions. Past offers
include 2-for-1 pizza deals
on Thursdays. Currently,
it’s offering 50% off mains
from Monday to Thursday
and 50% off takeaways
all day everyday up till
2nd October. Without
discounts, the mains cost
around £10 - £15. Keep an
eye out for great deals on
their website! Vegetarian
and vegan options availa-
ble.
Franco Manca
Another pizza place
near Imperial, specialising
in sourdough pizza. Con-
veniently, you can order
your pizza on their website
and pick it up at a time of
your choice – a great way
to beat the queue! The
cheapest pizza is £4.95
with others less than £8.
Oriental Canteen
Reputed to be the
cheapest place to eat in
the South Kensington
area, Oriental Canteen is
definitely the favourite
place for people who
crave cheap Chinese food.
Its menu includes fried
noodles, roasted duck with
rice and fried rice. The
shop owner is rumoured
to be a Malaysian so it’s
not surprising to see some
Southeast Asian dishes on
the menu. The best part
about this shop is that the
prices are generally £6 or
less, saving you from the
dilemma of going broke or
starving.
Bosphorus
Kebab
With online reviews
singing praises and friends
swearing by it, it seems
like this Turkish shop on
Gloucester Road is the
place to go when you yearn
for something exotic. The
prices range from £6 to £8
and it is well-portioned,
its doner kebab being the
most popular order. The
downside is that there
are not many seats in this
small shop so it can be
crowded at times. Take-
aways are recommended.
Wasabi
Wasabi sells a variety
of ready-to-eat Japanese
food outside South Kens-
ington station, be it hot
food, sushi rolls or soups.
With bento prices from
£5 to £10, this place is
frequented by students
who want a quick lunch.
Recommended mains
include chicken katsu
curry bento and chicken
teriyaki bento. Vegetarian
options available.

may leave
you with a
few moments

a bit too weak
to go near a
stove”

Avoiding drunk food disasters – our guide to your post-
night out snacks
Here’s the deal: it’s pouring with rain, you’re drunk, and you’ve just come back from a night out at Ministry. All you
want is something carb-loaded before you nod off. Don’t worry – we’ve got you covered.

F
reshers’ week.
A time to make
new friends
and become
accustomed to new sur-
roundings, whether that
be a new borough, city,
or perhaps even a new
country. However, for
many, freshers’ week also
involves a few hangovers
and a number of drunk
food disasters. Don’t be
that person eating folded
squares of bread or dry
pasta at 4am. Equally, you
do not want to be remem-
bered for attempting to
cook an overly ambitious
three course meal in the
early hours of the morning.
Your new hall mates will
not thank you for setting
off the fire alarm, forcing
them to trudge down 19
flights of stairs (if you
live on the top floor of
the Woodward buildings)
in their pyjamas and flip
flops. Trust me – it’s not
the way to make friends.
The trick is to find a bal-
ance between good tasting
foods that your stomach
will thank you for, and
simplicity that your tired
alcohol-muddled brain
can deal with. Thankfully,
I’m here to give you a few
ideas.
The Old Classic:
Cheese and Crackers
I’m personally an
advocate for cheese and
crackers. Involves no
cooking and the custo-
misation possibilities are
endless. Fan of a particular
“Fan of stinky
blue cheese?
Enjoy it with
no fear of
judgement
in the empty
kitchen.”
“I would
strongly
encourage you
to diversify
your range of
instant carbs”
stinky blue cheese? Enjoy
it with no fear of judge-
ment in the empty kitchen.
Like cheese out of a can?
Ugh, but ok, go ahead,
this is your time to avoid
judgment. If you happen
in that! If not, try adding
pesto if you have some in
the cupboard. Nostalgic
for the days of Dairylea
Lunchables? Cut up and
add some ham to your
cheese and crackers.
Instant Carb Gratifica-
tion
If you’re a fan of the pot
noodle, I would encourage
you to diversify your
range of instant carbs, as
you’ll soon get sick of
them (or perhaps not, I
know people who swear
by them). Try different
flavours of microwaveable
rice or even couscous. Of
course, rice is easy peasy
to make in a rice cooker
or on the stove, but I think
cheating with a micro-
wave and avoiding boiling
hot water is probably the
safer (and definitely the
quicker) alternative after a
long night.
A Toasty End to the
Night
Fancy a sandwich but
want something warming
afteranightoutinLondon?
The obvious choice
here is a toasty. Here’s a
thought: pre-make it and
stick it in a reusable (let’s
be eco-friendly, this is
Imperial after all) toaster
bag. You can buy these for
a few pounds in big super-
markets and being able to
stick your toasties straight
into the toaster and avoid
waiting for your oven grill
to preheat is a huge time
saver. Too lazy to make
a toasted sandwich? Well
ok, then I guess toast is on
the menu. If you’re new to
Britain then I encourage
you to try marmite. You
will soon learn that this
controversial savoury
spread divides the nation
in half into lovers and
haters. Spread a very thin
layer over margarine/
butter – yum (you can
guess which half I fall
into).
DIY Takeaways
Save some money and
make your own takeaway
alternative. Buy some
oven chips, sprinkle
some cheese on top (buy
pre-grated for maximum
laziness), and stick it in the
oven on a baking tray. You
could also easily make
gravy by stirring gravy
granules into hot water
and pouring this over the
top of your cooked chips
to make the northern
English delicacy of cheesy
chips and gravy.
§
Of course preparing
your own drunk food will
take a bit more time and
require a bit more effort
than purchasing from
your fast food outlet of
choice. But where would
you rather wait for your
food? In your lovely warm
kitchen, close to the warm
embrace of your own bed,
or in a long queue some-
where in the West End,
Camden, or Elephant and
Castle? I know what I’d
choose.
Instant noodles might be a student’s best friend, but ensure you diversify your carb choices – why not branch out to couscous?! // Flickr/elsie.hui
to have some hummus,
guacamole, salsa, tzatziki,
or whatever your dip of
choice is in the fridge, then
perfect, dip some crackers
