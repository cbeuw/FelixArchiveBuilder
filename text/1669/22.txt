KenKesey–Author,revolutionary,andcounter-cultural
icon of the 1960s
When Kesey’s novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, was published in 1962 it sparked a debate around the nature
of conformism and the promise of the American dream

tension and par-
anoia reached
its height in the
mid-1950s, the American
government entered into
the most obscure stretch
of the arms race – devel-
opment of a weapon that
could be used as means of
mass mind control. During
this search psychedelics
drugs such as LSD were
discovered and tested in
government-sponsored ex-
periments that took place
in psychiatric facilities
across America, mostly
on college students such
as Ken Kesey, a 24 year
old Stanford writing stu-
dent from Oregon. Once
a week for six months
at Menlo Park Veteran’s
Hospital, Kesey would
be given an ambiguous
pill which would induce
hallucinatory visions that,
for Kesey, crystallised the
disturbing practices of
1950s psychotherapy. He
began to question the very
concept of sanity, viewing
the men in the hospital
not as riddled with mental
illness, but rather victims
of social ostracism.
They were perceived
as social abnormalities,
branded ‘crazy’, and were
psychologically coerced
into assimilating within
the strict norms of 1950s
American society. These
observations inspired him
to write one of the most
influential social and gov-
ernmental criticisms of the
20th century – One Flew
over the Cuckoo’s Nest.
The story details the
road to liberation of
men from a psychiatric
facility that is controlled
by the tyrannical Nurse
Ratchet. The men are kept
repressed by humiliating
group therapy sessions,
medication, and physical
and sexual abuse from
the nurses’ aides. Nurse
Ratchet’s dominance is
challenged by newcomer
R.P. McMurphy, who
inspires a sense of in-
dependence in the men,
leading to their eventual
emancipation through his
disruption of the totalitar-
ian regime.
Chief Bromden, a
Native American patient,
narrates the story, per-
ceiving the hospital as a
machine that is working as
part of a larger socio-eco-
nomic conspiracy he de-
scribes as the “combine”
– it consumes all in its
path and homogenises
anything that is wild. He
first becomes aware of
the combine when he is a
“R. P.
McMurphy
is the
nightmare of
the American
WASP” “Kesey opened
people’s
eyes to the
profound
limitations of
institutional
conformity”
young boy and the gov-
ernment displaces his tribe
from their native land in
order to build a hydroelec-
tric dam. The tribe were
not contributing anything
to the American capitalist
regime, and therefore the
government destroyed
their natural way of life
in order to make way for
a means of powering a
society that could ulti-
mately generate profit.
Nurse Ratchet acts as a
tool for the combine and
is depicted as robotic and
lacking any degree of fem-
ininity or maternal quali-
ties by Bromden. Her lack
of sensuality and emas-
culative treatment of the
men represents the pious
and puritanical attitudes of
1950s American society.
As an ex-army nurse
she runs the ward with
strict militaristic routines
and order, attempting
to condition the men to
conform to society outside
the hospital. Under her
control the ward becomes
“a little world inside that is
a made-to-scale prototype
of the world outside.” She
fuels the men’s paranoia,
turns a blind-eye to the
sexual abuse experienced
by them at the hands of
her aides, and maintains
an ever present threat
of brutal electroshock
therapy if they step out of
line.
McMurphy is the night-
mare of the American
WASP. A chronic gambler
of Irish descent who
“fights and fucks too
much”, he fakes mental
illness to escape working
at a penitentiary facility
and is send to the psychi-
atric ward. McMurphy’s
rebellion against the
strict social order inspires
confidence in the men, and
the struggle for dominance
betweenhimselfandNurse
Ratchet represents a battle
between natural human
wildness and oppressive
social constructs. Kesey
elevates McMurphy onto a
Christ-like platform: when
he defends the men from
sexual humiliation by
fighting one off the nurses’
aides, and as a result
is given electroshock
therapy, Kesey describes it
as a crucifixion.
By attacking Nurse
Ratchet towards the end
of the novel he commits
martyrdom. He is given
a lobotomy as result of
the attack and put in a
permanent vegetative
state, but the men see
this act as a destruction
of the social order that
has oppressed them for
years, and feel liberated.
Some are finally able to
check themselves out of
the hospital, and Chief
Bromden finally finds the
strength to lift the “control
panel” out of the ground
and smash it through a
hospital window, breaking
the transparent barrier that
existed between himself
and natural world outside.
In a society where
nuclear destruction was
an ever-present looming
spectre, and young work-
ing-class men were being
forcibly sent to Vietnam to
kill and die for capitalism,
Kesey clearly saw that
madness lay within the
institutions. He continued
to preach his message
after One Flew over the
Cuckoo’s Nest: the novel
was an immediate success,
and Kesey utilised the
profits of this success
to buy a bus, “Further”,
which he painted in
psychedelic colours and
drove around the country
with half a dozen other
self-titled “Merry Prank-
sters” and a jar of LSD-
laced orange juice. From
California to the New
York World’s fair they
spread concepts of love
and peace, and the trip,
described by his son as
“the start of 60s”, forever
immortalised Kesey as a
prophet of the psychedelic
revolution. One Flew over
the Cuckoo’s Nest not
only opened people’s eyes
to the profound limitations
of institutional conform-
ity, but also provided the
author with the means to
shape and fuel America’s
most significant coun-
terculture – the hippie
movement.

H.G. Wells’ little-known South Ken connection
BOOKS
Alice Peberdy
Books Editor
I
magine the Imperial
freshers of the past;
ponder where their
college career led
them. Research is probably
first to mind – medicine,
teaching, banking… Arts?
We’re scientists, not
robots! Great academics
are often churned out, but
our university also pro-
duced one of the fathers
of science fiction, H.G.
Wells.
A famous student who
studied under famous pro-
fessors, Wells joined the
Royal College of Science
in 1884. He especially
enjoyed the subjects of
zoology and biology
during his first year, and
did well. These were
taught by T.H. Huxley,
“Darwin’s Bulldog,” who
passionately supported the
theory of evolution. And
yet student life wasn’t
entirely plain sailing. –
Wells struggled with other
subjects, work-life balance
and money (despite re-
ceiving a scholarship).
Imperial must have
made an impact on the
young writer as its sur-
roundings earned a place
in his 1985 novel, The War
of the Worlds. It is upon
the narrator’s arrival in
South Kensington that the
climax of the novel begins.
It could be questioned
whether the location was
featured through pride
or the joy of seeing it in
disarry, but it is no less
entertaining to meet a
character who considers
breaking into the Natural
History Museum. Wells’
role as a scientist also
reflected upon the narrator
and his astronomer friend.
While it’s true most of his
characters have academic
backgrounds, The War of
the Worlds also drew upon
real scientific debates. The
story begins with an obser-
vation of “strange lights”
on Mars, a phenomenon
described in the journal
Nature a year before the
novel’s release. The ex-
istence of aliens was a hot
topic of the time, but Wells
was the first to write about
an invasion. The first page
of the novel establishes
the eerie, unsettling nature
of the subgenre and is well
worth a read.
Before his novels,
Wells’ began his writing
career while he was still
studying and published a
short story, The Chronic
Argonauts, in a college
magazine. Science Schools
Journal was created
during his final year and
he took the role of its first
editor. The paper would
later become known as
Phoenix which is still
printed today. The Chronic
Argonauts centred on a
young inventor and his
marvellous machine. The
tale would later be de-
veloped into a novel that
began an entire sub-genre
– it was called The Time
Machine. Quite fittingly,
Wells was honoured in a
1985 episode of Doctor
Who in which it is revealed
that one of the Doctor’s
companions is a young
version of the author.
Wells was a true genius
of science fiction with
so many more common
tropes of today appearing
in his novels: superhuman
abilities, dystopia, apoc-
alyptic utopia, and space
travel to name a few. The
use of a familiar setting to
aid the reader’s suspen-
sion of disbelief is known
as “Wells’ Law.” Even the
term “science fiction” is all
thanks to Herbert George.
AndstillWellsremained
a proficient academic. In
addition to fiction, the
author published many
essays and textbooks. One
remarkable book titled
The World Brain describes
the vision of a global com-
munication system and
encyclopaedia – spookily
similar of the world wide
web of today. He believed
he had earned himself a
fellowship with the Royal
Society for his contribu-
tion to “human ecology.”
While this was not one of
his many achievements,
Wells can be commended
as a reviewer for Nature
and his doctorate he
earned at age 78.
Wells’ legacy can be
found in even in some of
the most unlikely places;
he founded the Diabetes
Association, invented
the first recreational war
game, and is said to have
inspired the first liquid
fuelled rocket. His fame is
truly deserved as a master
of science and science
fiction alike.
