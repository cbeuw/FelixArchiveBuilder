T
he UK govern-
ment has agreed
to invest £65
million in a US
particle physics project, as
part of its first high-level
science and research
treaty with the US.
DUNE, the Deep Un-
derground Neutrino Ex-
periment and the LBNF,
Long-Baseline Neutrino
Facility have secured
investment following
the signing of a UK-US
Science and Technology
Agreement on 20 Septem-
ber. Both facilities will
be used to investigate the
elusive neutrino.
Discovered 60 years
ago, the neutrino is the
second most abundant
particle in the universe and
was long thought to weigh
nothing at all. But exper-

The language of science
W
hat is sci-
ence? Well,
that’s easy:
science is
the way that we uncover
the truths of the world, it
is universal, it is objective.
Well if you think that,
you are mistaken. We
are taught that the best
science happens when we
remove our ‘humanness’
from the equation. But
can we subtract ourselves
from science, removing all
those messy emotions?
The first problem is that
science is done by humans.
We make mistakes, we
form social groups and,
as much as we may hate
to admit it, we some-
times favour our own pet
hypotheses over others.
Worst of all, according to
17th century polymath,
Sir Francis Bacon, we talk
to each other about our
work using language and
the language we use can
impact our research.
Rutherford’s model
of the atom, the idea of a
‘genetic code’, and even
messenger RNA (mRNA)
came from a hypothetical,
metaphorical origin.
Though many scientists
consider themselves above
‘ornamental’ language,
metaphors and analogies
are a huge part of science.
Richard Dawkins’
pointed out in The
Selfish Gene, the use of
metaphor in science can
also generate “a new way
of seeing”, which can in
its own right make an
original contribution to
science. How we conceive
of a scientific entity or
phenomenon, like an atom
or a gene, and the poten-
tial properties we then
consider it to have affects
the direction of research.
By inherently concep-
tualising the brain ‘as a
computer’for instance, we
may begin to talk about its
‘processing power’, how
it is ‘wired’ and start to
perceive it as more like a
machine. This affects how
we conduct our research,
drawing us to pursue
this dominant school of
thought and move away
from features that may not
fit. In turn we may start to
ascribe properties of our
brain, e.g. intelligence
and consciousness, onto
machines.
The ‘wood-wide web’
is an emerging metaphor
explaining how trees
in forests can be linked
together via a network of
fungi, like how humans
are connected by the
world-wide web. Plants
have evolved mutualistic
relationships with fungal
partners, which give them
nitrogen in exchange for
photosynthetic carbon.
Trees that share the same
fungal partners can there-
fore be linked physically
underground. In 1997 Dr
Suzanne Simard was the
first to show that Doug-
las-fir and Paper-birch
saplings were using this
underground network to
transfer carbon, alternat-
ing who sent more given
the season. The conclu-
sion Simard came to,
that this was an example
of trees evolving to help
unrelated tree species,
was highly controversial.
Twenty years on, and
Simard has become the
forest ecology equivalent
of Brian Cox. Her crafts-
manship and populariza-
tion of the ‘wood-wide
web’ metaphor arguably
persuades us to conceive
of trees as inherently
social beings in a way
that supports her interpre-
tation of the difficult to
decipher data. She even
goes further, suggesting
that forests are ‘superor-
ganisms’ like ant colonies
or bee hives, behaving in
a way that “might remind
you of a sort of intelli-
gence,”. Her popular work
weaves a web of insightful
metaphors and analogies
which leave you feeling ‘at
iments in the late 1990s
showed that neutrinos
change type as they travel,
implying that they have a
small but non-zero mass.
This non-zero mass and
their ability to change type
could allow differences
between their matter and
antimatter interactions.
Studying these differences
could explain why the
universe is made of matter
and not antimatter.

in South Dakota, where
the Sanford Underground
Research facility (SURF)
is based. Once construct-

least 15 years.
DUNE like other
neutrino experiments, in-
cluding Japan’s proposed
H y p e r K a m i o k a n d e
experiment, don’t come
cheap. The US is funding
the DUNE facility’s con-
struction costs, but aims
to attract about $500m
(£370m) in international
funding to design and
build parts of the accel-
erator and detectors used
for experiments. The UK’s
contribution is the biggest
outside the US. There is
significant support for the
programme via CERN as
well, where large-scale
detector prototypes are
being constructed and
tested before being sent to
the US.
The Science and
Technology Facilities
Council will manage
the UK’s role, with two
STFC laboratories and
14 UK universities, in-
cluding Imperial, already
involved. “International
partnerships are the key to
building these world-lead-
ing experiments,” said
Brian Bowsher, the
STFC’s chief executive.
The first ever UK-US
Science and Technology
Agreement, signed by the
universities and science
minister Jo Johnson and
the US Department of
Energy, demonstrates
the UK’s commitment to
collaborating with interna-
tional partners on science
and innovation, according
to Johnson. “By working
with our key allies, we
are maintaining our
position as a global leader
in research for years to
come,” he said.

wonder if in future, this
