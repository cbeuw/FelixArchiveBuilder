Relatively un-miraculous
on “Bosses Hang” are
quite repetitive, and runs
for fifteen minutes; if you
have leftover study drugs
from exam season, you
might need them to get
through it.
While the first half is
standard-fare GY!BE, the
second half of the album
is some of their greatest
work. “Fam/famine”
effectively mixes ragged
drones with a drumline
that sounds more like
an Elvin Jones solo than
traditional post-rock fare.
The jazzy drumming is
coated in slow drone and,
towards the end, shim-
mering violin that sounds
like watching a sunset
through a dead forest.
The highlight of the
album is “Anthem for No
State.” A flowing chorus
of violins builds a hopeful
T
his psych-pop
album is neither
p a r t i c u l a r l y
psychedelic nor
particularly poppy, instead
preferring fairly unimagi-
native composition and
over-reliance on pro-
duction. I mean, there’s
nothing /wrong/ with it.
The band members are
objectively skilled musi-
cians, who play clearly
and effectively together.
There’s a pleasant, per-
vasive, oozing harmony
that takes talent to pull
off through the whole
runtime. Harp arpeggios
are performed with a
wonderful flourish, and
the bassline is marked by
crisp technicality. Where
the album leaves much to
be desired is the dreadful

composition. No risks
are taken over the band’s
earlier repetoire: compare
the wonderful syncopation
of “Joesph Carnell” to /

hat-hat-snare recycled
G
Y!BE has
earned itself a
seat in the post-
rock pantheon,
and for good reason. The
Montreal collective, led
by guitarist/composer
Efrim Menuck, has a
score of classic post-
rock albums. The band is
marked by a bleak, ragged,
distorted sound, always
aggressively limping to a
heroic climax, which in-
evitably fades once more
into droning noise. The
opening cut builds a dis-
sonant wall of sound that
gives way to a triumphant
march, carrying us into
“Bosses Hang,” a suite
that rounds out the first
half of the album. The
15-minute section builds
its way into a fantastically
cathartic climax in Part
III. Then again, the drones
yet wounded
mood, with
glimmers of upper
registers adding a
wonderful texture
of lightness to the
piece. Tension
builds with quick-
ening pace; it
drops off, cutting
to distorted slide
guitar reprising the
violin line in all but
timbre. The reprise
is gradually moved into
lower and lower registers,
until a quick resolution is
drowned out by discord-
ant noise. Then emerges
a forceful build over a
furious triplet-pocked
waltz, which resolves
into a pulsed waltz, over
which violins shriek and
soar. The album closes
by juxtaposing slowing
violin lines with a reprise
of the triplets, which fade
to a fuzzy sigh, and then
silence. This is one of
their most compellingly
beautiful pieces; the music
really does sound like
an anthem for no state.
So, does the album
match up to what is
expected of a post-rock
giant? Probably. At
least it’s better than
their last two efforts.

“I’m losing my edge”
claimed LCD’s James
Murphy as far back as
2002; fashionably late
to the party with a debut
single aged 32, he had
something to prove to the
Reed or Leonard Cohen
to contribute a spoken
word piece on the album’s
12 minute outro “Black
Screen”, but both died
before he got the chance
to ask. It’s fitting, then,
that this track ended up
as a tribute to friend, col-
laborator and idol David
Bowie, who supposedly
spurred the band into ref-
ormation by simply sug-
gesting that they should.
Not so fussed with
recreating the jangly
dancefloor fillers of yes-
teryear, the LP plods and
bubbles through varying
levels of intensity. Sinister
and cynical pieces such
as “I Used To” and “How
Do You Sleep?” show
Murphy at his most bitter,
while “Call the Police”
and the title track smack
of Sound of Silver’s tender
ballads “All My Friends”
and “Someone Great”.
Rousing tracks “Tonite”
and “Emotional Haircut”
perfectly utilise their
Talking Heads influenced
electro-rock style for
live performance, as
demonstrated in their two
powerful sold out Alex-
andra Palace shows, last
weekend. These confident
gigs saw 10,000-strong,
inter-generational crowds
coming together for a
carefully crafted blend
of old and new material

interspersed with wit,
charm, and a quick pee-
break for the band. A
strong comeback indeed.
In 2002 Murphy
revealed that he’s “never
as tired as when I’m
waking up”, 15 years later
he may be “still trying to
wake up”, but he certain-
ly hasn’t lost his edge.
OVER THE ENTIRE
RUNTIME OF THIS
FUCKING ALBUM. The
music lacks compelling
emotional connection,
favoring production tricks
and “ooh look at me I’m
so creative” melodic licks
over any serious attempt
to compose music with
emotional oomph. This
renders the album hard
to connect to, an intricate
work of musicianship that
I care about less passion-
ately than imagist poetry,
and I am not a poet.
Good for dinner parties,
or if you’re too high
to care that the whole
thing sounds the same.
