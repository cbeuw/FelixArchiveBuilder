Brexit: your wrap-up on all the issues you need to know
Brexit. With no background knowledge, the word seems innocuous enough
– the latest breakfast cereal perhaps? However, this now-infamous word
and all it represents have been the talk of the town for the past year and a
half. This summer, you’ve used it to screen prospective suitors on a first date,
been asked about it on your travels by fellow Europeans, and discussed it
with home friends you hadn’t seen all year. Relationships have unravelled,
political allegiances probed, and memes made from the word. Brexit has
infiltrated every part of your life, and so, the next time the topic crops up in
conversation (probably within the next 24 hours), let’s make sure you know
whatyou’retalkingaboutasyougracealuckysoulwithyouropinion.Here’s
what you need to know:

Trade – the Single
Market, the Customs
Union, and the Euro-
pean Economic Area
T
he question as
to whether the
UK should stay
in or leave the
European Single Market
has been at the forefront
of Brexit discussions but
what exactly is it and why
does it matter?
The EU Single Market
is a trade agreement that
seeks to guarantee the
free movement of goods,
capital, services, and
labour within it – termed
‘the four freedoms’. It
consists of the 28 EU
members as well as
Iceland, Liechtenstein,
and Norway who have
access through the
European Economic Area
agreement, whereby they
implementEUlawsrelated
to the four freedoms in
exchange for access.
Being part of the
European Customs Union
means that goods crossing
national borders aren’t
subject to tariffs, such as
the common tariff placed
on imports to the EU from
non-EU countries. It also
means that member states
aren’t allowed to create
their own trade agree-
ments with other nations.
Well, this is awkward... // Wikimedia
Just what are tariffs anyway?
Tariffs provide countries with a source of
revenue, whilst also protecting domestic
industries from foreign competitors who
may be able to produce something for less
– either because of lax regulation in areas
such as workers’rights and environmental
protections, or simply because they are more
efficient at producing a product. Either way,
imported goods become more expensive
with tariffs, making them less competitive in
a market.
Some feel the single
market should be the
chief focus of the UK’s
negotiations with the EU
as it is widely perceived to
be a positive feature of the
European Union from the
standpoint of businesses
and prosperity. Staying
in it would preserve the
current friction-free trade
with the EU – Britain’s
biggest trading partner
– in goods but more im-
portantly in services, upon
which the bulk of the UK
economy is based.
The Tories want a
2-year transitional period,
after officially leaving the
EU, where there would
still be access to the
single market and during
which a new UK-EU trade
deal would be devised.
Theresa May has said that
the UK is willing to pay
€20 billion for such an
agreement, which the EU
has said is insufficient.
Apparently the so-called
“Norway model” was con-
sidered, whereby the UK
would pay to remain in the
European Economic Area
in the long-run. However,
this model now appears
to be off the table after
staunch opposition from
hard-line Brexiteers who
dismiss the single market
as a hindrance that should
be escaped – the so-called
‘hard Brexit’.
Labour’s official
position is that the UK
should remain in the single
market during a four-year
transition period. They
were one of the first to
propose such an approach.
Some from the party,
however, further insist
that the UK should remain
in the single-market indef-
initely as “the supposed
benefits of a clean break
with the EU are a fantasy”.
Access during a transi-
tionperiod,asinbothcases
above, would almost cer-
tainly require abiding by
the four freedoms. There-
fore, the free movement
of people would remain
as it is; regulations would
still align with those of the
EU; the European Court
of Justice’s rulings would
still apply; and the UK
would still pay into the EU
budget. All this, whilst not
being able to influence the
laws and regulations that
would apply to it.
Were such a transition
period to become indef-
inite or Britain decided
to maintain membership
to the single market and
customs union some
would argue the UK would
be worse off than if it were
a member. The Liberal
Democrats, therefore,
propose a potential “exit
from Brexit” and want
the public to vote on the
final deal with the option
to stay in Europe if they
don’t like it.
Why was chlorinated
chicken in your news
feed?
Should the UK leave
the single market and start
forging its own trade deals
across the globe, a subse-
quent change (slackening)
in regulatory standards
may follow, which could
mean that goods on the
market are of a different
(lower) standard to what
they are now. It appears
that chlorinated chicken
has become the poster
child for this laxity in reg-
ulation that might ensue,
which some believe would
be worse for the consumer.
In this particular case, it
might mean that your fried
chicken might’ve taken
a dip in chlorine before
satisfying your post night-
out munchies because of
a trade deal with the US
who want to sell such
meat in Britain.
Law: The European
court of justice and
the great repeal bill
The European court of
justice (ECJ) is the highest
court in the European
Union. Judges from
member states interpret
EU law and make rulings
accordingly. They are the
highest court in the Union
and can issue rulings over
national courts. Its deci-
sions are made in public
and detailed reasoning is
offered on decisions, and
so, the ECJ is thought to
be largely good at what it
“Trade experts
claim that a
seamless UK-
Ireland border
would be
impossible if
the UK leaves
the single
market”

to the UK. For example,
EU law would refer to EU
institutions, which Britain
would no longer be a part
of. Such nuances would
be incredibly important
to address. It has been
said that the bill is likely
to be “one of the largest
legislative projects ever
undertaken in the UK”.
In its current form,
the bill gives the govern-
ment the ability to make
“corrections” to the laws
without any involvement
or scrutiny from parlia-
ment. Many see this as a
“naked power grab” and
do not want the bill to
pass without amendments
to prevent this and for
parliament to be consulted
on changes that might be
made.
The Irish border
The border between the
Republic and Northern
Ireland will be the only
land border between
the UK and the EU post
Brexit. Currently, it is vir-
tually invisible, meaning
that goods, services, and
people (up to 30,000 per
day) can move between
the two countries totally
unhindered.
A “seamless, friction-
less border” remains the
end-goal for the current
government. However,
trade experts claim that
this would be impossible
if the UK leaves the single
market as Ireland would
have to “apply EU law
with no choice but to have
customs checks on the
border”.
For instance, it might
meanthatvehiclescarrying
goods between the two ju-
risdictions would now be
stopped and taken through
a border check – adding
to a business’s expenses.
Other issues also arise
and include those sur-
rounding the taxation of
goods such as cigarettes;
the movement and man-
ufacturing of milk-based
products; and the produc-
tion of Guinness, which
crosses the border twice
before being shipped off
to a pub near you.
The divorce bill: show
me the money
Known officially as
the ‘reste à liquider’, the
Brexit ‘divorce bill’ is the
sum of the UK’s financial
obligations to the EU
which was agreed upon in
the past, and have yet to be
paid. It is separate to the
€20 billion mentioned pre-
viously that was proposed
for continued access to the
EU single market. Like
with any divorce, defining
the amount of money has
become a heated issue
between the UK gov-
ernment, other political
parties and the EU.
Gargantuan figures
estimating the bill have
littered the headlines
leading to unfriendly and
conflicting discourse on
all sides. Estimates have
ranged from €40 billion to
as much as €100 billion.
The money relates to
previous pledges the UK
has made towards the
EU budget; infrastructure
programs such as for roads
and railways; investment
projects; and other long-
term liabilities that might
remain. The UK govern-
ment have said they rec-
ognise prior commitments
that should be honoured
but have stopped short of
fleshing out the details and
value of such obligations.
The amount will likely
be subject to the future
relationship the UK has
with the EU after 2019.
For example, if the UK
decides to stay in certain
programmes such as
Erasmus for students,
or a particular scientific
research organisation,
the bill would likely be
lowered accordingly.
Citizens’rights
Citizens’ rights are
rights and protections for
all EU citizens under EU
law. They include free
movement and residence,
equal treatment, and rights
related to work, education,
and health.
It is one of the most
politically-charged issues
in the Brexit debate. Some
claim that the referendum
result mandated new rules
on immigration from the
EU but others completely
oppose such an interpreta-
tion of the result, and cite
have said that people will
not be used as bargaining
chips in discussions and
that all would be treated
fairly; however, there
have been a number
of high-profile cases
mounting up evidence to
the contrary.
Long-standing resi-
dents and those lawfully
living in the country have
been threatened with
persecution. A recent case
involved a researcher from
Oxford, who had been
staying in the country
legally, with a valid work
visa, for 10 years but nev-
ertheless was sent a letter
revoking certain rights
and telling him to leave.
He was sent an apology
– however, this wasn’t an
isolated case. Last month
for example, the Home
Office mistakenly sent
up to 100 letters to EU
nationals living in the UK
ordering them to leave the
country or face deporta-
tion. This all whilst the
UK has yet to leave the

the EU, the ECJ would
theoretically not have such
powers, although, should
Britain wish to maintain its
access to the single market
then European laws and
ECJ rulings related to this
would likely still apply.
The EU withdrawal bill,
also known as the great
repeal bill, is a piece of
legislation that essentially
copies and pastes EU
law into UK law to try
and avoid disruption on
the day Britain actually
leaves. This, however, is
not as simple as it might
first appear. Lots would
