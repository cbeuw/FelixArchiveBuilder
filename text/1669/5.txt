So you got placed into Woodward Buildings?
Here’s what you can expect
Woodward might come with a reputation of being isolated, but the benefits of North Acton’s
McDonalds speak for themselves

built on the outer edge of
zone 2, between Acton
cemetery, Park Royal
industrial estate, and the
A40 arterial road. At
£128 a week it boasts
great facilities for a
fraction of the price of
the South Kensington
Halls. However, for
many like myself, it was
not our first option or
even an option we had
considered at all. Instead,
the seemingly-random
Imperial allocation policy
left us lumbered with a
take-it-or-leave-it offer.
At first this is a shock:
you were sold on the
notion of living in South
Kensington and having a
gentle stroll into lectures,
but are now facing a 45-
minute commute in the
battery hen conditions of
the Central Line at rush
hour. You quickly accept
your fate and move in,
understanding that it is
going to take you ages to
get anywhere.
But it’s all not as bad as
it seems: after spending an
hour and a half together
each day, you’ll create
great friendships with
those you commute in
with. Conversations
will naturally pause
mid-sentence during the
minute-long screeching of
the rails between Holland
Park and Notting Hill Gate
and then, without hesita-
tion, continue like nothing
happened. An introduction
to Citymapper and you’ll
fall in love: this app is
the commuter’s bible and
you’ll preach it to anyone
who hasn’t heard of it.
In early minglings with
non-Woodward students
you may encounter the
Woodward prejudice,
where you’ll be an object
of both sympathy and
ridicule. Their feelings
will eventually turn
to envy, whether they
want to admit it or not,
following a pre-drinking
session where they see
your superior panoramic
kitchen, double bed, and
ensuite at £100 less a week
than what they’re paying.
As a Woodwardian, you
will face a certain number
of dilemmas: whether ot
not to take a coat, which
may seem trivial to others,
will be a common debate
amongst your peers. Do
you risk being wet all
day after your rainy walk
across Hyde Park, or be
dry but sweat out your
bodyweight on the tube
and have the annoyance of
carrying it around all day?
The answer is unclear.
Other rigorous debates
include which way to uni
is fastest: to get off and
use the circle line or to
walk from Queensway
or Lancaster gate? This
depends on walking speed
and circle line timings;
Citymapper to the rescue.
Also, don’t be fooled
by the notion that you’ll
be able to do extra work
whilst commuting. This
is a lie and deserves to
be debunked: there is no
room for book reading at
peak time and you won’t
feel like it anyway after a
full day of lectures/labs.
The 1.5 hours will unpro-
ductively vanish out of
your day – although you
might create some sweet
Spotify playlists.
The night tube will
leave you in both disbe-
lief and delight as you
watch drunk people zip
across the city. Whether
it’s the sweet, wine-like
aroma migrating along
the carriage from a puke
covered 50-year-old, or
a couple having an awk-
wardly public break up,
there’s usually something
to see as you attack your
chicken nuggs/kebab on
the way back to North
North Acton McDonalds.
You’ll have a great year,
good luck.

Acton. It’s also inevitable
that at some point after
a night out either you or
somebody you know will
fall asleep on the tube and
end up in West Ruislip.
You’ve been warned.
Overall, the experience
of Woodward forces you
to learn how to navigate
London’s public transport
system, organise your time
well, and be proactive.
Despite its drawbacks,
it’s nice to be outside of

and this year students can
look forward to the new

Should antifascists use violence as a tactic?
The use of violence by antifascist
groups in the US is preventing
healthy democratic activism
Those who complain about Antifa’s
tactics don’t understand the reasons
why they’ve become necessary

O
n August 12th,
a ‘Unite the
Right’ march
was held in the
town of Charlottesville,
Virginia. It was organised
by a White Nationalist
to protest the planned
removal of a statue of
American Confederate
general Robert. E. Lee,
and resulted not only in
heated conflict, but the
tragic death of a young
counter-protestor. For
me, this episode, and the
ensuing furore, was dis-
turbing for two reasons.
The first was, obviously,
the gun-toting Nazis; the
second, however, was
the response of some
protesting students and a
disparate group known as
‘Antifa’ – Anti-Fascists.
In numerous locations
across the country, these
activists illegally defaced
and sometimes forcibly
removed statues they
didn’t like. At the Univer-
sity of Virginia, students
clambered onto a statue
of Thomas Jefferson – one
of the Founding Fathers –
and placed a black shroud
over it, branding it racist.
In Baltimore, a statue of
Christopher Columbus,
the Italian explorer, was
attacked by activists
wielding sledgehammers,
and a statue of Francis
Scott Key, an anti-ab-
olitionist lawyer, was
vandalised. Numerous
other statues have been
similarly defaced, all in
complete violation of
the law. Even more dis-
turbingly, Vice published
an online article that put
forward an argument that
it was perfectly ok to
punch neo-Nazis in the
face.
When did it become
acceptable to arbitrarily
break the law to pursue
your own agenda? I think
ninety percent of the ‘art’
in the Tate Modern is junk,
but that doesn’t mean I’m
entitled to burn the place
down. I’m not trying to
suggest ‘moral equiva-
lence’ of the beliefs of the
Nazis and those of Antifa
(and neither did Trump)
– I’m merely saying that
neither one has the right
to break the law to further
their own agenda. Such
behaviour is not only
totally unacceptable in a
liberal society, but it runs
counter to the very ideals
that Antifa stand for. They
of the law, upholding
the values of intellectual
diversity and peaceful
protest.
Another upset-
ting example of this
attitude emerged as Len
McClusky, the far-left
leader of Unite, said he
would break the law to
hold a strike protesting
the public sector pay cap.
Aside from the fact that
education and experience
equivalent staff salaries
are higher in the public
sector than in the private
sector, what McCluskey
is saying is that he doesn’t
really give a damn about
what anyone else thinks,
because he knows he’s
right and so he is in some
way above the law.
I do appreciate the
argument that, sometimes,
breaking the law is the
right thing to do, such
as those people who
smuggled slaves illegally
into Canada to freedom.
With the Confederate
statues, however, the
argument simply falls
down: there is a perfectly
legitimate, legal process
for communities to
remove statues if they
see fit, something that has
successfully and peaceful-
ly happened in numerous
places across the country;
there is no excuse whatso-
ever to break the law.
Fundamentally, I am not
trying to draw a parallel
between the moral stand-
points of anyone on either
side of any argument; I
am merely frustrated at
those who, no matter their
intentions, muddy the
waters of healthy debate
and positive activism by
breaking the law to further
their own agenda.
L
et’s get this
straight: Antifa
is not some
group of recently
post-pubescent students
with an inherent hatred
of bronze figures. Antifa
action is, in principle,
taken up to fight against
violence or intolerance
by fascists (a.k.a. racist/
nationalist scumbags).
Whilst I’ll applaud
Baltimore’s mayor Cath-
erine Pugh for promptly
removing all the confed-
erate statues from the city
in response to the Unite
the Right rally, that saw
a woman lose her life to
a white-supremacist with
road rage, the reality is that
the rest of the country has
not caught on. Protections
are already widespread
and growing (with dull
names like the “Alabama
Memorial Preservation
Act”) for monuments that
glorify those who rejected
the right of slaves to be
treated like human beings.
No wonder that some
people have decided to
take matters into their own
hands, since the democrat-
ic governments that should
be taking them down have
gone in the complete
opposite direction.
Let’s acknowledge that
these are not just statues
that objectively inform us
of our checkered past, but
monuments with inscrip-
tions like “In memory of
the boys who wore gray”
as a symbol of admira-
tion for their efforts. To
continue to protect these
memorials that revel in
false heroism is misguided
if done in the name of his-
torical preservation, since
nobody is suggesting an
en masse burning of con-
federate historical files.
The fact that the KKK and
Nazi sympathisers have
taken to prancing around
statues whilst threatening
global genocide shows
the level of bizarreness
we have reached 70 years
after laws were put in
place to prevent just this
sort of thing.
Now, a word of caution:
even though Antifa in the
US is much more of a
movement than a general
idea, as it is over here in
the old world (with the
original German anti-
fascists just dressing up
in black to bash in some
nazi skulls), it’s still not
right to think of Antifa as
one group. They certainly
don’t have a leader akin
to a prime minister or a
CEO. Nobody’s making
decisions that everyone
has to follow blindly, and
I guarantee you anyone
who tried wouldn’t last
very long. You’ll have a
much better time under-
standing how this works
when you understand that
Antifa is an idea – the
principle – that sometimes
the best way to deal with
white supremacists, the
KKK, and neo-Nazis is
to actually get up out of
our armchairs, go beyond
checking a box on a piece
of paper every five years,
and physically stop them.
The law might not allow
for it, but laws that have
failed to stop a new wave
of fascism are laws that
have failed.
oppose people who are
intolerant of the ideas and
beliefs of others, but they
seem to feel as if it is ok
for them to ignore the
rule of law and carry out
their self-devised justice.
This has nothing to do
with whether or not the
statues should be removed
– personally, I think that
they should be – but the
fact is that, no matter the
perceived nobility of the
cause, all members of
society should debate and
reason within the confines
“Antifascists
are ignoring
the rule of law
and carrying
out their
self-devised
justice”
