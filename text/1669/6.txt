Kim Jong-un is perfectly sane
The leader of North Korea has been in the news constantly over the past few months, thanks to
his drive to produce nuclear weapons. However, while some others stereotype him as a “mad
dictator”, Kim Jong-un is actually tactically playing a risky game of cat and mouse with the
West.

N
orth Korea, as
a state, adheres
to the Juche
p h i l o s o p h y.
Created by Kim Il-sung,
the founding ruler of
North Korea, it expounds
a policy of self-reliance.
Under the guiding hand
of successive members of
the Kim dynasty, North
Korea has moved into the
21st century as a deeply
repressive and secretive
state, with its diplomatic
standpoint dictated by the
aftermath of the Korean
war of 1950-1953 and its
inability to engage with the
international community
over its nuclear ambitions.
North Korea has had some
focus on nuclear weapons
as they would allow
the Mutually-Assured
Destruction (MAD) doc-
trine to come into effect,
essentially rendering
the regime invulnerable
and – more importantly
– self-sufficient.
The drive for nuclear
weapons has been the
principle reason for it
appearing in the news on
a near-constant basis over
the course of the summer.
North Korea has been
completing rocket tests at
a rate previously unseen,
as well as detonating a
high yield nuclear device.
It has also released images
of a possibly miniaturised
nuclear weapon, probably
suitable as a payload. This
relatively rapid progress
reflects both the fact that
the technology behind
nuclear weaponry is not
as advanced as before as
well as an increased level
of investment.
However, it is worth
considering: what does
North Korea need these
nuclear weapons for, and
who are they pointing
them at? It is possible
to make the assumption
that all nuclear weapons
are used as a means of
self-defence, but in that
case against whom?
In the past, deterrence,
against the West at least,
was achieved by a large
concentration of artillery
pieces targeting Seoul, as
well as one of the largest
armies in the world. The
consequences of engaging
with this force at present
or in the future for the
West would be catastrophe
causing mass casualties
and major disruption if not
destruction of one of the
world’s largest economies.
Unity in adversity against
the West with its two other
immediate neighbours,
China and the Soviet
Union, now Russia, meant
that it did not require a
deterrence strategy in that
direction. Therefore, why
the increased emphasis on
nuclear weaponry?
Firstly, there is the new
man on the block, Kim
Jong-un. He ascended
to the throne in 2011
following the death of his
father, Kim Jong-il, as a
relatively young and inex-
perienced ruler. His story
is deserving of at least one
brutal Netflix series, but
the key events in his path
to power include his re-
placing of his half-brother
Kim Jong-nam as the heir
apparent and the conflict
with his uncle, Jang Song-
thaek. These two charac-
ters, the former killed by
VX and the latter by an
anti-aircraft firing squad
(North Korean executions
are imaginative) fuelled
the potential instability of
the young ruler’s regime
by allegedly plotting a
coup attempt in collabo-
ration with China, which
would have replaced Kim
Jong-un with his elder
brother. This has report-
edly led to a rift opening
up between Beijing and
Pyonyang, possibly
persuading Kim Jong-un
of the need to push for
nuclear weapons in order
to render his regime safe
from future meddling.
There are further signs of
a rift too, such as China
attempting to hush up
news of the successful
nuclear test, as well as
China’s cooperation with
the West in enforcing
harsher sanctions. He may
also wish to cement his
position in the pantheon
of North Korean rulers
by being the first member
to have an operational
nuclear deterrent. The
North Koreans venerate
the ruling dynasty, and this
fulfilment of a part of the
Juche philosophy would
further validate his reign.
Secondly, these tests
coincide with the large
military exercises that
NATO organises at this
point in the year. North
Korea views these exer-
cises as preparation for an
invasion and an affront to
its sovereignty. It probably
hopes that a fully capable
deterrent would demoti-
vate the US and its allies
from performing these
community, and con-
stantly raising the stakes,
Kim Jong-un seems to be
attempting to force the
UN to conclude that not
only is a nuclear armed
North Korea inevitable,
but that it is necessary for
these states to engage with
it in dialogue and to lift
sanctions.
This is dangerous
brinkmanship: but it is not
mad.
Disclaimer: I have
received no funds from the
North Korean regime, but
if they wish to subsidise
me, I am contactable by
email for negotiation.
No remuneration can
convince me to endorse
Kim’s hairstyle.

exercises, both from the
threat of a strike, and the
futility of preparing for an
invasion against a nuclear
armed state.
Finally, there is North
Korea’s economic and
agricultural position. The
North has been struggling
with famines since 1994
and is largely dependent
on external food aid to
feed its citizens. In the
past, the North Korean
regime has bargained
with the suspension of its
weapons programme in
return for international aid.
