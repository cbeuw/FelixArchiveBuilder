AFreedom of Information
request by Times Higher
Education (THE) has revealed
that Imperial College London is
among around one in six universities
in the UK to set targets for the
amount of grant money brought in by
its academics.
The practise of setting grant income
targets for individuals was scrutinised
after the suicide of Stefan Grimm,
a Professor of Toxicology in the
Imperial College Faculty of Medicine,
last September.
93 UK universities responded to
the FoI request from THE, which
asked whether or not they set targets
of this kind. Of these, 11 universities
reported that individual grant-
winning goals are set for at least some
members of their faculties.
Another 12 institutions have targets
set at institutional, departmental or
faculty level; this means that in total
30 percent of universities set grant
income targets of some kind.
As well as Imperial, targets are set
for individuals at the universities
of Aberdeen, Dundee, East Anglia,
Glasgow, Greenwich and Leeds,
as well as Queen Mary University
of London, Plymouth University,
Abertay University and Robert
Gordon University.
Greenwich, Abertay, Robert
Gordon, Dundee and Leeds
reportedly stated that these targets
are set “only on a case-by-case basis”,
while Plymouth and East Anglia say
that academics are “encouraged” but
not required to bring in the target
amount of grant money, the THE
reports.
In their response, Glasgow said
that targets are used alongside other
metrics in the criteria looked at when
considering promotions for senior
lecturers. Meanwhile Aberdeen
say that their “expectations” are
only used to inform conversations
about “which aspects (if any) of an
individual’s career might need more
attention or support to develop”.
The universities of Bath, Bradford,
Surrey, Ulster and Warwick did
not respond with the requested
information, claiming that it was
“commercially sensitive”.
However in an article last year
THE reported that Warwick
Medical School and the University
of Warwick School of Life Sciences
single out academics for potential
redundancy if their research income
over the previous four years is below
an average of £90,000 or £75,000
respectively.
At Imperial, academics are
expected to “cover the costs of their
employment” with the income
from their research and teaching
work. There are also minimum
performance standards within some
departments that sometimes include
“a general statement of the amount
of income that a researcher… might
normally be expected to generate”.
The inquest into the death of
Professor Stefan Grimm in April this
year heard a report from Imperial’s
internal review of staff policies,
which was conducted in response
to Grimm’s suicide. Senior coroner
Chinyere Inyama noted that funding
issues were mounting stress on the
professor, who was undergoing an
“informal review process” after
“struggling to fulfil the metrics” of
his post.
Led by Imperial’s director of
Human Resources Louise Lindsay,
the review recommended a number of
changes including increased support
for staff members who are struggling,
though Ms Lindsay admitted at the
inquest that the changes still may not
have prevented Grimm’s death.
Members of the academic
community have called out the
practice of setting grant targets
for encouraging “overstretched”
staff to take on more projects
than they can reasonably manage
and discriminating against more
inexpensive research.
UCL students threatened after rent strikes
Students living in accommodation
run by University College
London (UCL) have been
threatened by the university
with serious repercussions after
withholding rent due to allegedly
‘unliveable’ conditions in their halls.
UCL has warned the final year
students that they will not be
permitted to attend their graduation
ceremony, receive their final results
or have their degree reported
unless they settle the outstanding
accommodation payments.
Returning students will not
be permitted to re-enrol at the
university until the balance is
paid off, warns the site manager of
Campbell House in a letter to those
taking part in the strike. Summer
accommodation offers could also be
withdrawn.
However, the accommodation
office at UCL has reportedly claimed
that this was only a ‘standard letter’
which is sent out to any student with
an outstanding debt to the university,
and the Head of Residential
Accommodation has stated that they
will not seek academic sanctions
against the students.
The University College
London Union Accommodation
Representative David Dahlborn
described the threats as “both vile
and cowardly” and claimed that they
“represent a mentality at UCL that
the bosses would rather expel their
best and brightest students than
take their complaints and demands
seriously”.
Up to 200 students at Campbell
House and 230 at Hawkridge House
have been withholding rent money
on the grounds that conditions in
their accommodation buildings are
sub-par, and that ‘severely’ disruptive
building works have been ongoing
throughout the exam period.
They accuse UCL of violating
the Student Accommodation Code
(SAC) which sets out regulations
for all halls of residence. The SAC
states that “All maintenance works
should be undertaken so as to
minimise inconvenience to residents
… endeavours should be made to
avoid sensitive periods such as
examinations”.
Construction work has been taking
place at Hawkridge House, located
in Chalk Farm, since February 2015
despite the original plan stating that
the disruption would be started in
September 2014 and finished by this
January.
Scaffolding has been erected on
all sides of the building, resulting
in a lack of natural sunlight inside,
and dust and drilling noise have
reportedly left students unable to
revise, causing stress and health issues
for them.
When the rooms were advertised
to students last summer there was
no warning that any building work
would be taking place. More than
half of the residents have demanded
a refund of their accommodation
payments.
Residents of Campbell House
in Bloomsbury have also faced
disruption as the building next
door is being demolished. Work has
reportedly been taking place from
8am, Monday to Saturday for several
months.
Students have complained of noisy
drilling at over 90 decibels inside
rooms causing desks and mirrors to
shake. Shaniqua Hunter, a resident of
Campbell House, stated “I can’t even
make phone calls, watch television,
study, take a nap or listen to music in
my own room”.
A spokesman for UCL reportedly
said that students have been offered
alternative study space, while
bedrooms elsewhere have been
sourced for some others. UCL have
yet to make an official comment
on the status of the threats and
compensation.
