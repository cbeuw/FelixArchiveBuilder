Philippa Skett reports as voting opens for new Woodward bar
Imperial College Union are
running a poll to name the new
student bar out in Acton, on the
site of Woodward halls.
The new hall of residence in North
Acton will open in September and
will be home to over 700 first year
students, and there will be a new bar
and restaurant based on the site ran
jointly by Imperial College Union and
the College Campus services.
In a similar set up to h-bar, campus
services will oversee the provision of
food at the location and the Union
will take care of the management of
the bar.
Suggested names include One
Victoria Road, The Foundry, West
Three, Urban Oak, The Contingency,
The 1923 and The Meter. Also you
can submit your own suggestions.
The poll is more so to gauge
opinion of the names already being
considered than a competition,
although a union spokesperson said:
“if there is a popular favourite not on
the list we may go for that.”
Felix is aware that so far, over
40 suggestions of the name “The
Library” has been made through
the Union website, whilst around 30
other suggestions for the name “The
Kaye Bar” have also been submitted.
The Union ran a similar scheme
back in 2010, for students to name the
bars based in Beit Quad before they
were re-opened in the November of
that year. Before the redevelopment
of the Union bars, the nightclub was
known as dB’s and the bar was known
as Da Vinci’s.
Students were invited to email in
ideas to rename the venues directly
to the Union, and a list of over 150
suggested was whittled down to a
shortlist for each venue.
A shortlist was announced for the
new nightclub (now Metric), which
included alternative names such as
Neighbourhood, Lab, Theory and Iris.
Interestingly, the original shortlist
for FiveSixEight didn’t feature its
current name on the first shortlist;
options instead included The Library,
Consort, Crown and Shield and,
simply, Quad.
However there was outcry over
the names available, with a group
of students setting up a Facebook
group in support of the name “Rock
Bottom” attracting considerable
attention.
Students could then vote online for
the name of their choice. The name
“Metric” received over 200 votes, but
for the bar area, the name Consort
actually won with 131 votes, followed
closely by the Library that received
126.
The Union decided to re-open
nominations for new suggestions for
the name, and eventually settled on
calling the bar FiveSixEight.
Said a Union spokesperson:
“Imperial College Union is excited
to be part of ensuring that the
student experience for residents of
Woodward Hall is the best it can be.
“The new bar and restaurant,
alongside the gym, offer some great
social and activity spaces for students
living in the hall as well as those who
live nearby.
“We are working closely with
Campus Services to ensure that the
nearly 700 students get the best
possible welcome and on-going sense
of community.
“The opportunity for students to
have an input on the name of the new
bar and restaurant is just one little
part of that.”
The poll is open now, and you can
submit your choice at https://www.
imperialcollegeunion.org/help-us-
name-new-bar-woodward-hall.
Union award winners announced
Imperial College Union Council
ratified the list of individual
Union Award winners at its
meeting on Tuesday 8 June, which
sees 156 students out of the 310 who
were nominated receiving various
accolades. The awards recognise those
working across the Union, from clubs
and societies to representation, with a
belief that ‘those who have gone over
and above what is expected of them
should be recognised.’
Selection of Union Award winners
was conducted by the Union Awards
Committee, consisting of three
Officer Trustees and nine appointed
Union members with a longstanding
history of senior contribution to
Union life and activities.
Council was only asked to uphold
the list of winners for Union Colours,
Outstanding Services Awards and
Union Fellowships. Other award
winners, such as Community
Connections Volunteer of the Year,
Club, Society & Project of the Year
and the President’s Awards, will only

Cecily Johnson on the controversy that has taken place over the last week
Nobel Laureate Sir Tim Hunt resigns from
Royal Society post after sexist comments
Nobel Prize winner and fellow
of the Royal Society Sir
Tim Hunt has apologised
for causing offence and resigned
from the Biological Sciences Awards
Committee of the Royal Society and
an honorary professorship at UCL
after sexist statements he made in a
recent speech sparked outrage among
the scientific community.
Speaking at an event ahead of
the World Conference of Science
Journalists in Seoul, Sir Hunt
reportedly stated that the “trouble
with girls” in the laboratory
environment is that “you fall in love
with them, they fall in love with you,
and when you criticise them, they
cry”.
Sir Hunt added “I’m in favour of
single-sex labs”. His comments were
published on Twitter by Connie St
Louis, a Director of studies in Science
Journalism at City University,
London, who was attending the
event. Ms St Louis said that the event
was “utterly ruined” by the sexist
comments.
“Nobody was laughing, everybody
was stony-faced,” she said in an
interview with the BBC. “The Korean
female scientists who hosted us
looked aghast and he just ploughed
on for about five to seven minutes. It
was culturally insensitive and it was
very sexist.
“I just thought, ‘Where in the world
do you think you are that you can
be making these kind of comments
in 2015?’”. Ms St Louis was among
around 100 guests in attendance at
the lunch in South Korea on Monday
8th
June.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today
programme, Sir Hunt said he is
“really sorry that I caused any
offence” and that it was “a very stupid
thing to do in the presence of all those
journalists”, but admitted that he “did
mean” what he had said.
“I just meant to be honest, actually”.
With regard to his remark about
women crying, he stated “It’s terribly
important that you can criticise
people’s ideas without criticising
them and if they burst into tears, it
means that you tend to hold back
from getting at the absolute truth”.
He also said “I have fallen in love
with people in the lab and people in
the lab have fallen in love with me
and it’s very disruptive to the science
because it’s terribly important that
in a lab people are on a level playing
field”.
Sir Hunt stressed that his earlier
comments were intended to be “light-
hearted” and “ironic” but had been
“interpreted deadly seriously by my
audience”. He has subsequently been
criticised by several leading members
of the scientific community.
Former chief scientific adviser
to the president of the European
Commission Professor Anne Glover
said in a statement “Tim Hunt
seems to have been speaking about
his personal problems in relating to
women.
“What he describes is not my
experience and I have never had a
student (male or female, straight
or gay) cry when their research was
criticised. Maybe it has something
to do with the way you criticise. I
hope his attitudes regarding women
are largely confined to a former
generation”.
Chief executive of the British
Science Association Imran Khan
called Sir Hunt’s comments
“careless” and stated: “Sadly, dealing
with sexism and other forms of
discrimination are a daily reality
for many people, and I imagine it’s
hard to find Sir Tim’s comments
funny if you’ve been held back by
systemic bias for years – whether
those remarks were intended as a joke
or not”.
Sir Hunt won the 2001 Nobel Prize
for Physiology or Medicine for his
work on cell division and became a
fellow of the Royal Society in 1991.
The Royal Society were quick to
distance themselves, releasing a
statement that said “Sir Tim Hunt
was speaking as an individual and his
reported comments in no way reflect
the views of the Royal Society”.
“The Royal Society believes that
in order to achieve everything that
it can, science needs to make the
best use of the research capabilities
of the entire population. Too many
talented individuals do not fulfil
their scientific potential because of
issues such as gender and the Society
is committed to helping to put this
right”.
Several critics called for the
organisation to take action against Sir
Hunt after reports of the comments
initially surfaced, including fellow
fellow of the Royal Society Professor
Dorothy Bishop, a professor of
developmental neuropsychology at
the University of Oxford.
“I have no doubt that, nice guy as
everyone confirms he is, he does his
best not to be overtly prejudiced, but
he clearly has a view of women that
just makes him inappropriate in these
roles,” she stated.
Professor Bishop urged the Royal
Society to remove Sir Hunt from
committees that influence and
make decisions on appointments,
fellowships and policy. “If this were
done, and a public statement issued to
that effect by the Royal Society, this
would demonstrate their seriousness
about diversity”.
It was announced on Thursday 11th
June that Sir Hunt had contacted
the Royal Society offering to resign
from its Biological Sciences Awards
Committee; his resignation has
been accepted. The Royal Society
said that Sir Hunt now recognises
that his earlier comments were
“unacceptable”.
In a statement on their website, the
Royal Society said “Sir Tim Hunt’s
recent comments relating to women
in science have no place in science,”
but also noted that “Sir Tim Hunt
has made exceptional contributions
to science” and “over the years he has
also supported the careers of many
young researchers.
“It is the great respect that he has
earned for his work that has made his
recent comments so disappointing”.
The Royal Society affirmed their
commitment to “helping to put this
right”.
On Wednesday 10th
June University
College London confirmed that Sir
Hunt has resigned from his position
as Honorary Professor with the UCL
Faculty of Life Sciences. “UCL was the
first university in England to admit
women students on equal terms to
men, and the university believes that
this outcome is compatible with our
commitment to gender equality”.
