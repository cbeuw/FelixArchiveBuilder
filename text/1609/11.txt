Yung Nam Cheah shares her top ten favourite travel apps
Travel made easy - the world of apps
It’s no secret that the internet has
revolutionized the world: there
is a whole host of information
and applications available now that
weren’t there a few decades ago.
People can now do things on their
phone that no one could even dream
of before – in fact, I still remember
putting my phone away for my
travels a few years back and now I
wouldn’t even think about not having
it on me.
With the apps market springing
up like wild grass in spring, you can
virtually download an application for
everything.
Through searching in the apps
store and recommendation from
friends and blogs, I have discovered
some great apps that I want to share
with you today and hopefully that
would help you in your travel too!
1) TripIt
An easy way to organise your
itinerary in one place, Tripit take
snippets of information from
confirmation emails you forward
them from your bookings, and puts it
all together. Now your flight details,
hotel bookings, and tour itinerary
are all in one place. You can get
directions, edit manually, and sync
it to your own calendar. And most
importantly, it’s free (there is a paid
version).
2) Pocket
This handy little app allows you to
save websites and read them later,
offline. Available on your browser as
well, you can save any articles, blog
posts, and even videos on your phone
for later. So now you don’t have to
screenshot it all.
3) Guide apps
For the lazy fellows out there who
don’t like to plan their trip, apps such
as Pocketguide and Rough Guide
will do all the planning for you. Bear
in mind that they usually charge
a fee (under a fiver); in exchange
they set up a route for you to follow
with information on the sights and
monuments. While they are handy
little things, you might want to check
before you purchase or follow the
route to make sure you actually enjoy
what’s on it.
4) Xe currency
We have all been there – when you
see something beautiful on a trip and
wants to buy it, but had to calculate
the conversion in your head every
time.
Xe currency not only allows you to
quickly calculate the rate, it allows
comparison with up to five currencies
as well as their exchange rate profile.
5) Tripadvisor City Guide
How do you know whether you
should go to restaurant A or B?
Simple – check their rating on the
Tripadvisor City Guide app.
It downloads reviews on a map
offline, so you can rest assured that
the restaurant you are going to is
vetted. Make sure you download the
correct city before you leave – this is
made easier by the new Tripadvisor
Catalogue app.
6) Citymapper
Currently only available in certain
metropolis, this urban jungle
public transport navigation app is
constantly expanding territories.
Integrating all manner of transport,
it helps you pick out the best travel
routes from point A to B, and even
tells you the cost.
So if you are heading to New York,
Paris, or Madrid, this can make your
life a whole lot easier.
7) Rail planner (Eurail/
Interrail)
An offline app that shows you the
timetable for Eurail and Interrail
passes, this is perfect for anyone
travelling through Europe by train.
This is especially true for those who
are compulsive at planning and
knowing every part of the journey
(like me), because it shows you all
the stops and even the route on map
so you can follow every part of the
journey. The only downside is you
can’t buy tickets through it.
8) EventBrite
An app that I am sure most of you
would already possess, it lets you
discover local events, buy tickets,
and show them on your phone. This
is perfect for last minute night out
at a foreign city where you won’t
necessarily have access to a printer.
9) Airline apps
Most airlines now have an app
where you can check in and get your
boarding pass. This is very useful,
particularly for those who don’t have
any luggage to check in because it
saves you time at the airport. It also
gives you update on the status of the
flight so you will know whether or not
it’s delayed.
10) Kites
An app designed by an Imperial
graduate, this still-expanding app
shows you recommendations by users
all over the world. With a twitter-
based format, each ‘kite’ is only 140
characters long, keeping things short
and sweet with option to add photos.
You can follow users and add your
kites into a collection, like a London
Harry Potter tour.
Hopefully these apps would help
smooth over your journey and makes
life as a traveller easier. Now your
only problem would be making sure
you have enough battery power in
your phone to last for the day!.

“How on
Earth
are we
supposed
to fit
everything
we need
into such
a small
space?”
Travelling on budget airline isn’t
easy – you’ve got the luggage
restriction, liquid restriction,
and only airline magazines for
entertainment. However, with their
unbeatable prices you can only
grit your teeth and adhere to the
increasingly intricate rules of hand
luggage restriction to save the extra
dosh for something more worth it.
The two most popular budget
airlines in UK are Ryanair and
Easyjet. Surprisingly, Ryanair is the
more lenient of the two and offer
travelers a 10kg limit of a suitcase of
55 x 40 x 20 cm size, as well as a small
bag of 35 x 20 x 20 cm dimension.
Though allowing a bag up to 56 x 45
x 25 cm, Easyjet only guarantee your
luggage with you if it’s smaller than
50 x 40 x 20cm and you can only take
one bag.
Whilst this might not be a problem
for some, those of you who are a
heavy packer – like me – will cry
in outrage. How on Earth are we
supposed to fit everything we need
into such a small space? However,
since I been on two one-month long
trips this summer, I realised that
you really can pack as little as that
and still be okay, as long as you are
prepared.
1) Plan your outfits two, no
three, times
Whether it is for a weekend getaway
or a year-long trip – choose your
favourite outfits, then choose from
it your favourites, then again. This
will help you narrow down which
really is your favourite and save
you the dead weight and used space
in your luggage. If you are not that
picky, do it twice only. Remember
that unless you are heading off into
the wilderness (in which case you
really need that 20kg luggage), there’s
nothing you can’t buy once you get
there.
2) Get those 100ml bottles
from Primark or drug stores
There are really no needs to succumb
into buying those small travel portion
shampoo and conditioners they
have in Boots that costs an arm or
leg. Be green and buy a set of travel
bottles for 1 pound, and save yourself
some money. Unless you shower
three times a day, a 100ml bottle
of shampoo can last you for up to a
month.
Same goes for any of your favourite
skincare products – put them into
those handy little clear, circular
containers. This way, you can fit a lot
into your 20 x 20 cm plastic bag.
And need I remind you that you are
only allow liquids in less than 100ml
bottle, even if the actual content in it
is less than 100ml.
3) Clear plastic bags – save
some for next trip
Speaking of the clear little plastic
bags, you might be shocked to know
that not every airport offers them for
free. What? Aren’t they compulsory
to put your liquids in? Yes.
You can grab some (in fact, tons)
for free at Heathrow and Gatwick,
but if you are flying from Stansted
or Luton, bring you own, otherwise
you will have to pay 1 pounds for five
even if you only need one.
If you are a frequent traveler, just
grab a few and re-use them – saves
you time as well.
4) Wear all the chunky stuff
This is especially true for shoes. If you
are bringing a pair of walking boots,
or any chunky footwear, it’s best to
conserve space by wearing them.
Bundle as many layers on your body
as you can; it might look weird but
you are saving precious space! Take a
coat with you too, to keep that space
free in your bag for other things.
5) Send in one bag as a group
If there are enough of you going
together, and you all have something
you desperately want to bring some
more goodies on the plane, then it
might be feasible to send one bag
through together. This will make it
more economical and if you are all
in it together then no one can point
fingers when you wait for luggage!
