James Bezer reports on Imperial’s latest dino-discovery
Agroup from Imperial has
discovered evidence of soft
tissues in poorly-preserved
75-million-year-old dinosaur fossils.
The group analysed 8 typical bone
samples from the Natural History
Museum that showed no obvious
signs of soft tissue preservation. The
samples analysed included a claw of a
meat-eating dinosaur, a few toe bones
from a duck-billed hadrosaur and rib
fragments with unknown origins.
Using electron microscopes, and a
focused ion-beam (FIB) to investigate
the fossils’ internal structure,
they discovered bands that closely
resemble collagen fibres in modern
bone samples. This was backed up
by mass spectrometry, which found
peaks consistent with fragments of
amino acids present in collagen.
In two samples, they also discovered
structures that appear very similar to
red blood cells from birds, and which
were again backed up with results
from mass spectrometry, showing a
strong chemical similarity to cells
from emus.
Sergio Bertazzo, a Junior Research
Fellow from the Department of
Materials and lead author on the
paper, says he was “totally blown
away” by the results.
“We were actually hoping so see
the gaps left in bone by the organic
material that had decomposed.
“This was absolutely not what
we were expecting to find at all. It
actually took quite a while for us to be
convinced of what we saw.”
Evidence of soft tissues has
previously been found in only a
handful of extremely high quality
fossils.
Most, however, are too poorly
preserved to show any obvious signs.
This is because protein molecules
decay quickly—it was previously
believed that their full structure
could not be preserved for longer
than around 4 million years.
Therefore, even in the best
preserved fossils, evidence has only
previously been found of protein
fragments.
According to Bertazzo, however,
although the findings are promising,
further research is needed to confirm
them.
“I think we will need to find more
of these structures in other fossils,
and if we are lucky enough to find
fossils with a larger quantity of the
structures, we will be able to isolate
them and do even more biochemical
tests. We will then be sure that they
are red blood cells.”
The paper, published in Nature
Communications, involved researchers
from the departments of Materials,
Earth Science and Bioengineering.
Their results and techniques could
lead to a wealth of new information
about dinosaur tissues, as they reveal
that far more can be discovered from
less well-preserved fossils than was
previously believed.
If confirmed, they could help
answer many open questions in
palaeontology. Investigations
into their red blood cells could, for
example, identify when dinosaurs
evolved from being cold blooded to
warm blooded.
And there could be fragments of
other tissues and molecules preserved
within fossils that could give further
clues about the animals’ biochemical
make-up.
“If we can confirm that our initial
observations are correct, then this
could yield fresh insights into how
NASA’s supersonic “flying saucer” parachute fails
The parachute NASA hopes will
land its future craft on Mars has
broken up in a test over the Pacific
Ocean.
The current system,which was
used to land the Curiosity rover
in 2012,has been used since the
1970s,and has now reached the
limit of the size of payload it can
carry.
The new decelerator consists
of a 6 or 8m inflating drag device
to slow the craft down to around
mach 2,and a larger 30m main
parachute,more than twice the
size of the previous system.It’s
designed to slow down craft
weighing up to 3 tonnes,and would
be used on any future manned
missions.
Landing fast-moving craft on
Mars is much harder than doing
so on Earth,because its thin
atmosphere doesn’t provide
enough resistance for conventional
parachutes to work effectively.
But,unlike on the moon,which
has no atmosphere,this thin
atmosphere makes using rockets
alone unsuitable.
NASA tested the decelerator in
the stratosphere,where the air is
similar to the Martian atmosphere.
This is the second failed test of
the LDSD,but those involved are
keen to show the test was partially
successful.
“The physics involved with
LDSD is so cutting-edge we learn
something profound every time
we test,”said Ian Clark,Principal
Investigator of the project.
“Going into this year’s flight,I
wanted to see that the parachute
opened further than it did last
year before it began to rupture
The limited data set we have at
present indicates we may not only
have gone well down the road to
full inflation,but we may have
achieved it.”

these creatures once lived and
evolved,” said Bertazzo.
“What we showed here is that this
kind of preservation is probably
much more common than we
expected, so I cannot even begin to
speculate about what can be found in
the future.”
