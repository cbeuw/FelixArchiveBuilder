Don’t keep it all bottled up
Afew weeks ago, the results of
a College-wide mental health
survey was released on Felix.
At first glance, the numbers
looked scary where 75% out of
1115 respondents said that they’d
experienced unhealthy amounts of
stress and mental health symptoms
sometime during their time in
Imperial.
It is more comforting to see the
figures concerning help they have
sought out.
To give a recap on some numbers,
more than half of sufferers said that
they confided in friends, 20% said
they saw a GP and 13% said that they
approached their personal tutor for
help regarding this.
Unfortunately, 28% said that
they didn’t disclose their stress or
condition with anyone.
In addition to this, 16% suspected
that they have a mental illness but
are yet to be diagnosed, which is only
slightly different to the percentage
of those who have already been
medically diagnosed (20%).
Combined with the number of
respondents who spoke to no one
about their stress, this suggests that
there is a lonely group who did not
receive any help for their conditions.
I think there are a number of
possible reasons for this: Help might
not be visible enough, which is
something currently being addressed
by Mentality.
Some people might prefer to deal
with the stress and their condition on
their own.
Or finally, seeking help of any
kind is a terrifying prospect,
whether because of the stigma
surrounding mental illnesses or fear
of dramatising themselves.
The last reason is the topic I want to
talk about this week.
It’s a scary feeling when you want
help but are stopped by real or
imagined pressure, because it’s not
a visible problem that can be easily
resolved.
It’s a kind of isolation and
loneliness that can’t be explained to
others because it seems to go against
every instinct to talk about it. An
example will show you what I mean.
Say, you’re suffering from a case
of depression but you don’t know
about it. Every once in a while, you
will enter an episode that makes
everything seem pointless and
unachievable for days on end, even if
this is something as simple as getting
out of bed. You suspect it might be
depression, but you quickly shoot
Admitting that you are suffering from a mental illness can be just as nerve-wracking as admitting you’re gay.

Chanon Wongsatayanont explains why seeking
help for mental illness can be tough
"Mental
illness
can be a
confusing
and
isolating
experience
which
makes
seeking help
harder than
it seems"
"If your
social circle
has a stigma
for mental
illness,
confiding
to them is
like coming
out to a
group of
homophobic
friends."

You can also go to your academic
or personal tutor regarding
pastoral issues,especially if you
think your mental health might
be affecting your academic
performance.
down the thought, dismissing it as the
blues everyone talks about.
So of course you wouldn’t talk to
anyone about it since it’s nothing,
right?
But the suffering is real. Weeks and
weeks go by and these terrible phases
come back.
You still think it’s the blues and
you’re more sensitive than everyone
else because you can’t get out of it like
everyone else can.
By blaming yourself for being
overly dramatic, you bottle it up even
more, putting up a wall so no one
would judge you.
Even if you know your friends
would be sympathetic, you don’t want
to risk the misunderstanding.
If your social circle has a stigma
for mental illness, confiding to
them is like coming out to a group of
homophobic friends.
One difference in the analogy
however. While homosexuality is
a usually concrete where you feel
attracted to guys or girls, mental
illness has a lot of overlap with
everyday emotions and it’s sometimes
hard to draw the line between them.
Coming back to my original point,
experiencing a mental illness can be
a confusing and isolating experience
which makes seeking help harder
than it seems.
Because of stigma and fear of
misunderstanding, there is a vast gap
between self-diagnosis and going to
the health centre for an actual one, or
seeking any help at all.
To bridge this gap, there are the call
centres on the side of this page.
Some of these numbers, such as the
Samaritans, are operated by trained
supporters who can give advice or just
listen, depending on what the caller
prefers.
The best thing about these services
is the anonymity. That way, sufferers
won’t have to be afraid of judgments
or consequences after confiding in
someone else.
After calling them, the sufferer
would hopefully know more about
what they’re going through, without
having to confront the wall they set
up for themselves because they’re
talking to trained strangers.
Then with that information, it is
much easier to decide whether they
still want to seek out help as they
now have a second opinion, which
is invaluable when you already
have a whirlwind of doubts and
unconfirmed fears in your head.
Regardless of your choice,
contacting call centres would be a
helpful and harmless first step to
however you choose to deal with the
stress you experience.
