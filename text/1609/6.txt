Tessa Davey takes a look at female
genital mutilation in Africa and closer
to home
Nigeria bans FGM,
but how much still
needs to change?
Female genital mutilation
(FGM) has been performed on
more than 130 million women
and girls worldwide, and more than
20,000 girls under the age of 15 in the
UK are considered at risk. It is often
done using razors, sharpened rocks,
glass or even fingernails as tools.
The partial or total removal of the
external female genitalia or other
injury to the female genital organs
for non-medical reasons has been
referred to as mutilation since 1929.
Despite this, FGM is still often called
female circumcision, or by a huge
variety of terms that imply cleansing
or purification. By others, it is
referred to as “cutting”.
FGM is a violation of human
rights under several conventions, but
despite this it is widely performed
in some parts of the world, largely
concentrated in 29 countries across
Africa, with varying levels of
prevalence. It is most common in
Somalia, Guinea, Djibouti, Egypt and
Sierra Leone, where more than 90%
of women experience FGM. However
this is not to say that it is only a
problem in Africa. It is estimated
that more than 137 thousand women
in girls in the UK have been forced
to undergo FGM, an estimate that is
increasing month on month.
FGM is traditionally done to
preserve virginity, reduce sexual
desire, and even maintain a clean
appearance of the genital organs.
There are several types, ranging from
pricking or cauterising the clitoris,
to total removal of the clitoral hood,
glans, inner and outer labia, with
the total closure of the genital area,
with a small hole left for urine and
menstrual blood to pass through. The
World Health Organisation classifies
FGM into four categories, where each
type varies in prevalence. The most
extreme type of FGM ­– where the
legs are bound together from thigh
to ankle for weeks following the
procedure to allow healing – is carried
out on 90% of all girls in Somalia.
Girls who are not cut are often
outcast by their community, being
called unclean or impure. There is

immense pressure on families to
mutilate their children, particularly
from elder female members of
the family. It is often these senior
matriarchs who will enforce
this torture; in a parallel to male
circumcision, it is largely done
because it was done to them – there
are no reported health benefits.
However despite this being so
widespread in some countries, it
is unspoken, often referred to as
“washing your hands” or “having
your bath”, and most women in
these regions lack the vocabulary to
describe what has happened to them
or talk about it properly. In most
communities, the women do not
realise that ensuing problems are as
a result of the procedure and most
women who have undergone FGM
say that they would do it to their
daughters, but this is largely because
they have never known anything
else, and they do not realise the
implications. Increasingly, women
who have emigrated to Western
countries are horrified at what has
been done to them, but continue the
practise out of fear of being shunned.
Cutting is often not seen as a rite
of passage, something to signal the
transformation from girl to women.
FGM has very complex and varied
roots; it is recorded as practices
relating both to religion or ethnic
traditions, depending on the region.
There are versions of FGM, such as
the stretching and lengthening of the
labia minora or clitoris, or internal
cutting of the vaginal walls, which
are said to enhance the pleasure
experienced by men. The roots of the
practice, particularly in the case of
sewing, seem to stem from preventing
young girls and women from
engaging in any sexual activity before
they are married – it is common for
a man’s family to inspect the woman
to ensure that her barrier is intact.
Once a girl is married, she will be cut
partially open either by her husband,
mother-in-law, or a circumciser (who
is usually an elderly woman) to allow
for penetration. In the later case of
childbirth, she will be cut open to
allow her to give birth, and closed
afterwards.
Complications can arise as a result
of this repeated cutting, as well as
from the procedure itself. There are
many common complications such
as bleeding, swelling, infection, and
problems with healing. Scarring
and keloids may form, and damage
to the urethra and vagina may
cause infections, incontinence, and
even infertility. Women who have
experienced FGM are at higher risk
of problems during pregnancy, and
have a higher chance of neonatal
mortality. They are more likely to
experience pain during sex, have
no sexual desire, or reduced sexual
feelings.
FGM has long been outlawed in
many Western countries, including
the UK since 1985, and this month,
Nigeria, where around 25% of females
are cut, passed a law banning this
practice. Nigeria is not the first
African country to do so, but it
represents a significant step forward
for a country where it is ingrained
in cultural fabric of so many
communities. Of course, there is a lot
of progress yet to be made in Nigeria
alone; simply criminalising FGM will
not immediately stop all incidence
of this violence, but it represents a
change to the traditional culture of
violence against women, and will
hopefully cause a shift in thinking
that will spread across the rest of
Africa.
This is a lot to take in, and a lot of

it might make you reel in horror. But
the fact is, in the UK, FGM is also a
significant issue. Even though it has
been criminalised for decades, it has
always been swept under the rug, with
people afraid to discuss it for fear of
being culturally insensitive. It was
only last year that data began to be
collected on the prevalence of FGM
in the UK, and by all counts, it seems
to have been grossly underestimated.
In March, 578 women and girls
were treated for FGM in England,
with thousands being reported since
September. Every month that data is
collected, the estimate for the number
of women suffering the effects of this
mutilation increases.
FGM hit the headlines in the UK
last year when it was revealed that
there had never been a successful
prosecution for the practice of FGM,
even though it has been illegal in
the UK for a long time, with laws
strengthened in 2003 preventing
travel to other countries for the
purpose of performing FGM. Last
year, guidelines for Border Force
agents were changed, to help prevent
girls from being taken out of the
country to be cut, and teachers and
doctors have begun to be trained
in identifying girls that may be at
risk. In February this year, the first
ever FGM case in the UK went to
court, but it was against a doctor
in an isolated case, not prosecuting
someone working as a cutter in a
large clinic, one of the circumcisers
who come to the UK for “cutting
parties”, or someone taking their
child to be mutilated abroad; these
incidents have yet to be adequately
investigated.
For Nigeria, it is a huge step to ban
FGM across the country. While it was
already outlawed in some states, in
others it is a cultural normality. With
this law, the Nigerian government
are saying that a traditional
cultural practice is suddenly totally
unacceptable, regardless of its
historical significance. This is not
an easy thing to do; certainly many
people will be unhappy with this, as
they have always done it and believe
cutting to be necessary, but now that
it has been criminalised the awareness
and education will increase and the
prevalence will decrease. If Nigeria
can make such a bold statement, I
think that we also should be able to
make as much effort, be it through
a strengthening of prevention,
education, and awareness.
I find the number of women and
girls, both within and outside this
country, who are forced to undergo
mutilation to be shocking. I find
it horrifying that even within this
country girls are being taken away
to be cut, not because it has any
benefits, but because of a long-
standing culture of shame. The only
way to stem this appalling practice is
to the break the taboo that shrouds
it; by taking away the euphemisms
and misunderstandings, and giving
women the option not to do this to
their daughters.
