Imperial centre identifies high cost of care
for Afghanistan veterans
Researchers at the Royal British
Legion Centre for Blast Injury
Studies have valued the cost
of caring for members of the armed
forces serving in Afghanistan who
have lost limbs at just under £290
million.
When broken down, it cost £1.16
million per person to treat soldiers
who required an above-the-knee
amputation, while those who required
a below-the-knee amputation
required care worth £870,000 per
person.
Their findings have been published
in the journal Clinical Orthopaedics
and Related Research. This cost
includes rehabilitation fees and
trauma care, as well as prosthetic
limbs.
The centre, which is located at
Imperial College London, raised
concern over the cost, which they say
may be underestimated because of the
potential need to replace prosthetics
in the future, as well as other illnesses
(both experienced by all citizens)
as well as injuries specific to bomb-
related injuries.
The Royal British Legion also
felt that the cost of care has been
underestimated up until now.
However, the researchers hope that
the study will help in planning for
the costs of care in the longer term.
Additionally, avenues for future
research into the long-term effects of
blast injuries have been identified.
This study has been praised by Sue
Freeth, the Director of Operations at
the Royal British Legion.
She said, “This is the first attempt
we know of to publish an independent
estimate of the lifetime healthcare
cost of the British service personnel
seriously injured by IEDs [improvised
explosive devices] in Afghanistan.
“This paper should alert health
commissioners to the scale of the
problem, and help them to plan ahead
to meet the lifetime health care needs
of this generation.”
The Royal British Legion Centre
for Blast Injury Studies was opened
by Prince Harry in 2013. The centre
is the first in the United Kingdom
where civilian researchers work with
military doctors.
The centre performs research into
possible methods of reducing the
effects of bomb injuries, such as those
caused by IEDs.

Transport for London
to accept Apple Pay
Transport for London have
announced that they will
accept Apple Pay when it
launches in the UK in July.
The move makes TfL the first
public transport operator to accept
the mobile payment technology.
The announcement follows Apple’s
confirmation that Apple Pay will be
making its way to Britain. At Apple’s
Worldwide Developer Conference
(WWDC) in San Francisco last week
it was also confirmed that Apple
Pay will be available to customers
of nearly all of the UK’s banks, with
Barclays being the notable omission.
The service still requires an iPhone 6
or Apple Watch.
Apple have stated that Apple Pay
will also be supported at a number
of other retailers, including Boots,
Marks and Spencer, the Post Office
and Waitrose, however the near field
communication (NFC) technology
used by Apple means that any retailer
which accepts contactless payments
will accept Apple Pay as well.
TfL have confirmed that Apple Pay
users will receive the same benefits
as contactless card users, such as
Monday to Sunday fare capping,
which is currently unavailable on
Oyster.
TfL have reiterated their
commitment to not phase out Oyster
and to bring all the benefits currently
enjoyed by contactless users, such as
Monday to Sunday fare capping, to
Oyster customers as well.
Meanwhile, Google has announced
Android Pay, a very similar service
to Apple Pay but specific to Android
devices. Like Apple Pay, the
technology makes use of the same
NFC technology meaning that when
it launches in the UK, Android Pay
will also likely work on TfL services.
The news comes as TfL’s
controversial plan to close Tube
ticket offices takes pace. At time
of writing, ticket offices have been
closed at a number of tube stations
including Gloucester Road and West
Kensington. The ticket office at South
Kensington is scheduled to close at
some point between October and
December.
Some stations are to gain a
replacement “Visitor Information
Centre” which will sell travel tickets
as well as tickets to enter London
attractions. The first centre recently
opened at King’s Cross St. Pancras
station near the Eurostar terminal.

Physics exams plagued by multiple errors,
including setting an “impossible question”

Jaffe also told Felix that he wished
“to apologise for the error,” and
promised, “We will ensure that the
exam is marked fairly.”
The senior tutor for the Physics
department also offered his apologies
for the errors within the exam in the
same email.
Speaking to one student, they told
Felix how classmates were feeling
disappointed that exams are being
checked “so poorly’” and that some
also feel they have been “lied to by the
department regarding the quality of
proofreading.”
Said another student: “I’ve now sat
two consecutive exams that have been
riddled with errors, both needing
several corrections mid-exam, which
is detrimental to students being able
to focus.
“The Quantum Mechanics exam
contained several typographical
errors, driving some students to
disbelieving laughter as more and
more corrections had to be explained
to the cohort.
“The Imperial physics department
yet again shows how much they care
about research over the students.”
One student was keen to point
out that this may not be the fault of
just one individual. They told Felix:
“Andrew Jaffe is a very competent
lecturer, and was very apologetic
about the whole situation.
“I can understand that sometimes
it’s hard to see errors in your own
work, and thin that this is a problem
with the system rather than with the
lecturer.”
Another remained pessimistic,
stating: “The department doesn’t
really care too much for student
welfare anyway so other than feeling
embarrassed as a whole it probably
won’t do anything regardless of
student consensus.”
Said another: “The mistake was
completely unacceptable; it could
have been avoided if a single person
had attempted to do the question.”
This has not been the only
issue with exams for Physics
undergraduates this term; a Physics
undergraduate representative made
a “formal complaint” via email to
the Head of the Physics department,
Jordan Nash, on the “unacceptably
poor nature” of the Comprehensive
paper that was sat earlier on in term,
on the 6th
of May.
The email complaint stated how the
Comprehensive paper “contained no
fewer than three large errors,” which
we spotted and corrected mid-exam.
These errors included a missing
power function in an equation that

What checks
do exam
scripts go
through?
Felix spoke to a faculty member of
the physics department,who has
been working at Imperial for ten
years.He told us that after working
at several institutions across the
world,he was most impressed by
the level of scrutiny exam papers
go through before a student sits
them,and the analysis process
afterwards to ensure marking is
fair too.
He told us how the exam script
goes to a Course Associate first,
who checks the script and gives
feedback on the questions before
the revised exam script is sent to an
external Examiner.
He explained how along with
the script,the lecturer will provide
detailed information on how the
exam is designed,along with
solutions.“They receive a lot of
information about the exam,so
can provide a lot of opinions on the
exam script.”
These Examiners are academics
outside of the institution,and
although these external examiners
are not“experts in every field,”they
do give detailed feedback on the
exam.
When the changes are relayed
back to the lecturer,they then need
to report that the changes have
been put in place.
He said that typos will slip
in from time to time,but it is
uncommon for mistakes to be
made within the actual theory of
the questions.
“I have a lot of sympathy for
typos when they manage to sneak
in,but if the mistake is one of
actual physics I would actually be
surprised.”
However,having people sit
the exam beforehand to check
for these mistakes isn’t probably
the answer either:“The [exam
checking] system is so labour
intensive,that I think it would not
be a feasible thing to do,unless we
paid post docs to do it.”
After the exam,the faculty
members of the department meet
to discuss the exam papers in late
June.“Everything is gone through
in extreme detail.It is a massive
amount of work.”
He did state though that with
all the checkpoints in place,the
overall effect of such a question
like the one in the QM paper
shouldn’t be too great. “The actual
impact,as bad as it is to have that
happen and as frustrated it is to
have that happen,
“I would be surprised if it had as
negative an impact as they may
feel now.”
students were required to prove, and a
set of constraints about pressure in a
system that were incorrect.
Dr. Bob Forsyth, the Director of
Undergraduate studies, responded to
the formal complaint, stating that he
had confirmed with the Chair of the
Comprehensive exam panel that the
paper had passed through all of the
checking stages, including the script
being sent to an external examiner
beforehand.
Said Forsyth in his response: “The
errors on this paper were taken very
seriously by the examiners during
the exam, and all efforts have been
made in the marking to ensure that
no student has suffered in their result
due to the typographical errors.”
He concluded that also it would be
impossible to guarantee every exam
paper in the future will be 100% error
free, but he agreed that exam errors
should be an exception.
He assured the representative that
he would raise the general issue at a
Teaching Committee meeting in the
future.
Forsyth also told Felix: “I would like
to take this opportunity to reassure
all students that, where errors
have occurred, our examiners do
everything possible to ensure that no
students are disadvantaged in their
results.”
Two Comprehensive exams are sat
in third year, and together they are
worth a third of the year’s weighting
overall. The exams cover all topics
taught in both second and first year.
Over the term, there has been a
reported total of 17 issues across
various exams, affecting modules
across all year groups. Issues have
reportedly included poor quality
images being difficult to decipher,
incorrect units and potential energy
values, and various typos.
An accumulation of mistakes
resulted in the complaints being
relayed to the Faculty of Natural
Sciences Teaching staff. Third year
representative Ben Fernando met
with the staff Monday morning.
In an email to the rest of his year
group, Fernando stated that the staff
will be conducting an investigation
into the examination errors, and
that “they have promised a speedy
response.”
Said Fernando: “I am inclined not
to pass comment but in the interests
of transparency I can confirm that
my actions as year rep included
sending a number of emails to the
department staff, both before and
after exams, highlighting concerns
about procedure.
As there were a significant number
that received no reply the issue was
raised to a faculty level. I am led to
believe an investigation is on-going
and I’ve made the department aware
of at least 17 errors or issues with
examinations papers affecting 10
papers.”
This follows mistakes being made
in an assessed problem sheet and
a maths revision test sat at the
beginning of the year, which after
being highlighted to the department
by students, were initially deemed too
insignificant to be rectified.
Second year students were told to
“take it on the chin…it’s a drop in the
ocean,” by a senior teaching fellow,
which caused further complaints.
The Department of Physics was
ranked 8th
overall in the UK in
the recent Guardian League table,
although came in at 27th
when
ranked according to overall student
satisfaction.
