International Beckett Season:
Lessness & Waiting for Godot
Fred Fyles heads down to the Barbican Centre, where their season
celebrating the influential Irish writer gets underway with one of
his masterpieces, as well as a lesser-known work
The great Irish dramatist and
writer Samuel Beckett, whose
oeuvre the Barbican Centre
are celebrating through the month
of June, said that he wrote because
writing was all that he was good
for. Far be it from me to disagree
with him, but the man greatly
misestimated his talents. Beckett’s
writing does not really exist in the
realm of the written word; instead,
what he was exceptionally talented
at was creating an atmosphere. His
works may be endlessly interpreted
by generation upon generation of
scholars, eager to eake out more and
more meaning from every syllable,
but it is upon the stage that his words
really come to life, forcing us to sit up,
pay attention, and be awed.
Perhaps nowhere is this more
apparent than in Olwen Fouéré’s
interpretation of Lessness, a short
story translated from the original
French work, Sans. The work, which
is a pair of seemingly random
arrangements of 60 sentences, when
seen on paper, is really nothing more
than a jumble of repeating words
and phrases. But when transported
into the Barbican’s Frobisher
Auditorium, a deeply intimate
venue, Fouéré’s reading allows us to
make sense of the piece.
Sitting at a desk, bare but for a
anglepoise-style lamp, Fouéré faces
the audience, her white hair pushed
back behind a utilitarian pair of
headphones. Above her, a wide
screen of static is projected against
the wall, flickering to and fro. The
piece begins, and over the next 35
minutes she lures us into a trance
through the sheer power of Beckett’s
mind. With certain phrases coming
to prominence - little body; only
upright; true refuge - the mechanical
delivery of the lines weaves an
imaginary tapestry in the minds of
the viewer. Fleeting and ephemeral,
this vision, one of desolation,
longing, and alienation, somehow
manages to be both concrete and
ungraspable, something accentuated
by the minimal drone soundtrack,
composed by Phill Niblock. The
overall effect is heady and powerful,
creating a headspace for the audience,
which I can only describe with the
word ‘trippy’ - a term that simply does
not do justice to what was going on in
the room.
It is not clear whether Fouéré is
reciting from memory, or if she
is being fed the lines one-by-one
through her headphones. It’s not
even clear whether this is the original
work, or one of the innumerable
arrangements of the sentences
that are possible. Fouéré, for her
Sydney Theatre Company, Waiting for Godot, Richard Roxburgh, Luke Mullins, Hugo Weaving and Philip Quast Photo: Lisa Tomasetti
part, refuses to give the game away,
delivering her lines in a flat style that
brings to mind the American artist
Laurie Anderson. Born in Ireland to
French parents, Fouéré’s upbringing
makes her perhaps the perfect
person to interpret Beckett’s work,
understanding the nuances of both
the French and Irish components
of his mind; she certainly doesn’t
disappoint, conjuring up a ruined
mental landscape that seems to go on
forever.
While Fouéré manages to generate
a desolate wilderness in the mind
of the audience, such an effort is
not needed for those going to see
the Sydney Theatre Company’s
production of Waiting for Godot, for
which the Barbican Theatre has been
turned into an actual wasteland. The
stage, bare but for a naked tree which
twists upward to the rafters, cutting
a sharp line through the space, forms
the setting in which the characters
merely wait. And wait. And wait. Not
for nothing did critic Vivian Mercier
describe it as ‘a play in which nothing
happens, twice’. And yet, somehow it
seems that everything happens. I will
not try to elaborate on the meaning
of the play; there is no point, and
Beckett plays more on the nerves and
heartstrings of the audience, instead
of functioning as a cerebral exercise.
All I need to say is that by the time
the play is over, we are just that much
closer to understanding the human
condition.
The small cast, comprising of four
main members, is incredibly tight:
Richard Roxburgh lends a subtle
Australian brogue to his put-upon
Estragon, and finds a formidable
sparring partner in his companion
Vladimir, played by Hugo Weaving.
The pair bicker and squabble,
enacting out various games, passing
the time as they wait for the unseen
titular character. How long they have
been waiting, how long they will
continue to wait, remains a mystery,
furthering the sense of alienation
the audience finds themselves on the
receiving end of. Philip Quast plays
the role of Pozzo, who seems to be
trapped in his relationship with the
put-upon Lucky. Dragged this way
and that, near-mute throughout the
majority of the play, until he vomits
forth a stream of consciousness at the
end of Act I, Lucky is perhaps one of
the most difficult characters to get
right, but Luke Mullins brings an
extraordinary physicality to the role.
While the setting pays homage
to the idea of a post-apocalyptic
wasteland, set designer Zsolt Khell
also toys with the idea of the nature
of theatre - with its exposed backdrop,
the stage is clearly just that: a stage.
Perhaps Khell is trying to emphasise
the idea that the theatre is a dead
art; or maybe, as Pozzo says, ‘they
give birth astride a grave’, and the
instantaneous gleam of light that is
life is akin to a performance; either
way the staging has a powerful
effect on the play’s meaning and
atmosphere. In her costume design,
Alice Babbage - and perhaps I am
reading too much into this - seems
to have taken a uniquely Australian
direction: the down-on-their-luck
characters lurch around the stage
in old boots and musty jackets in
a spectrum of grey, looking like
some early settlers, lost in the bleak
outback.
The English translation of Waiting
for Godot is given the subtitle ‘a
tragicomedy in two acts’, and in this
production the comedic elements
are certainly highlighted. Capering
around the stage, Roxburgh and
Weaving form a brilliant duo, with
Vladimir providing a witty foil to
Estragon’s more grounded grumbles.
The production is clearly indebted to
the theatrical tradition of slapstick,
and the early physicality of actors
such as Buster Keaton, which provides
a rich seam of imaginative influences
for director Andrew Upton to mine.
At some points, however, it feels that
this aspect has taken precedence over
the tragic elements of the script, with
the themes of isolation, loneliness,
and general bleakness taking a back
seat. This does provide a warmth to
the play, which I have not seen in
other versions, but - particularly on a
warm summer night - sometimes one
requires a little bit of chill.

The poet John Keats,in a letter
to his brother,two years before
his death of tuberculosis,wrote
that‘nothing ever becomes real
until it is experienced.Even a
proverb is no proverb until your
Life has illustrated it’.To read
a great novel,to sit through a
powerful play,to wander the
hallowed halls of a gallery; these
are all means through which we
are able to experience the world
around us.This issue of Felix Arts,
we bring together a number of
different cultural works,offering
a wealth of experiences.
We kick off at the Barbican
Centre,where a celebration of
the work of Samuel Beckett is
currently underway;nowhere is
Beckett’s power with language
more apparent than in these
productions of WaitingforGodot
or Lessness.
We then head over to the
Almeida,where Robert Icke
christens their Almeida Greeks
season with a production of
Oresteia,the only surviving
trilogy of tragedies from the
era.Lia William’s Klytemnestra
is a powerful interpretation
of woman scorned,and this
four-hour production is certainly
something that needs to be
experienced.
The paintings of Agnes Martin
are what we turn to next.
Aleksandra Berditchevskaia
heads along to the Tate
Modern’s retrospective of the
American artist whose work
defied interpretation.With their
subtle tones,and close attention
to detail,her work needs to be
seen to be truly appreciated,
and this exhibition is a rare
opportunity to do so.
Indira Mallik checks out the
SummerExhibition at the
Royal Academy; a yearly
showcase of the best art in the
country,both professional and
nonprofessional,the Summer
Exhibition marks the beginning
of the new artistic calendar,and
is always well worth a look,if
only for the spectacle.
Finally,Jack Steadman takes a
trip to the Valleys in the Royal
Court’s latest play,Violenceand
Son,a beguiling,powerful piece
of modern theatre that forces
the viewer to deal with the dark
nature of humanity.Truly,it is a
real experience.
