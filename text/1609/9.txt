A long time ago, in a game far far away...

CHOO CHOO! Max Eggl welcomes you to the Star Wars hype train!
War. War never changes... (Part 4)
If you love star wars, first person
shooters or in fact games in
general, you could not have missed
the fact that the makers of Battlefield,
DICE are remaking one of the best
First Person Shooters (FPS) game ever.
When the original battlefront
and its sequel came out and in my
childhood I spent many, many,
many hours immersed in these titles.
Therefore when it was first announced
that there would be finally be a new
game, tied in with the new movie
(which I am also more than excited to
see), I didn’t just board hype train, but
bought the whole damn track! Ever
since then we have been drip fed news
regarding the games development and
possible features, and I was getting
more and more excited.
However, just last month EA finally
decided to come clean about some
of the features (or lack thereof when
compared with the previous games)
that would be included in the game,
as well as showing off a teaser trailer.
The trailer itself looked amazingly
good (and brought about as many
feels as the movie trailer did), we saw
speeder bikes, AT-ATs, force fields
and jetpacks among many other
things. The concepts on show looked
pretty amazing, and I really hope that
the game-play delivers what the trailer
promised. While the graphics looked
stunning, you have to keep in mind
that this was actually all pre-rendered,
probably over a couple of days, to
make it look so good. So we can
assume that it won’t really look that
amazingly good, even with the best of
PCs. Sadly, most of us don’t have the
best PCs around, so you may have to
deal with the less beautiful graphics or
upgrade to a new rig (I really want to
do the latter, but will probably have to
accept the former).
In terms of features we have
confirmed that there will be 12
playable maps at launch on the
planets Hoth, Endor, Tattoine and
Sullust. Furthermore, in lieu of actual
space battles (yes they won’t be in
the game) we will instead have space
ships in the ground battles, a lá Hoth
from Battlefront 2. Furthermore, it
has been confirmed that heroes will
make a comeback, however at this
point only Darth Vader and Boba
Fett are confirmed. However, very
sadly, there will won’t a single-player
campaign. Especially the lack of a
single-player campaign makes me a
bit sad. While I do get the move to
multiplayer only, the singleplayer
in Battlefront 2 really had something
special and told a really good story!
With regards to the space battles, I
am not really too fussed. They were
kinda cool, but in reality where
really repetitive and while they may
have worked better in this modern
iteration, I don’t think we have lost
that much.
One warning that I would give you
guys, is don’t preorder. There are no
associated bonuses, and given DICE’s
Yes, the day of reckoning is
upon us. Global productivity
has come to a standstill. These
are the news headline that will echo
around the world on the day of the
release of Fallout 4.
If you have spent any time on the
internet in the past week, you know
that Bethesda has made a good
attempt at breaking it! After putting
up a countdown about a week ago,
Bethesda then released the trailer to
the newest installment in the Fallout
series.
For all of you who don’t know
what Fallout is; Fallout is a RPG
game set in a post apocalyptic which
has been ravaged by a nuclear war.
These games revolve around you
the protagonist trying to survive
this harsh wasteland. The games
themselves originated from a
text-based game to a full sandbox
game with RPG and FPS elements.
Basically, imagine Skyrim with
technology in post-apocalyptic
America, but better.
Sadly, the last Fallout game
was Fallout: New Vegas, which was
announced in 2010, almost 5 years
ago. So now, out of the blue (ok
fine, there have been several hints
here and there, but nothing really
solid) to get this is pretty neat. The
trailer itself has that same Fallout
feel as previous installments, with
the 40s, 50s style music and retro
futuristic design. We follow a dog,
as he explores an abandoned house,
getting the occasional flashback
to the better, more hopeful time
before the nuclear war. We then are
treated to a view of a ravaged and
destroyed Boston where the game
will take place, followed by scenes
of feral ghouls and even a return
of Deathclaw, a villain from the
previous games. Furthermore, we
are given the number of the vault
that it seems our main character
comes from, namely 111 (which also
happens to be binary for seven which
is pretty cool since this is the seventh
game in the series!).
There is no real further
information from the game, but if
you can’t hold in your excitement
there are several analysis videos of
the trailer that are trying to glean
as much information from it as
possible. Most people are hoping
for more information, including a
release date, at E3 which is in about
a week. However, what we do know
is that the game will be available on
Xbox One, PS4 and PC, so if you still
own the old generation of consoles it
may be time to update!
I have to say that I am really,
really excited for this game. There
hasn’t been any really good post-
apocalyptic games like Fallout in
a while (DayZ and all the zombie
games didn’t really live up to their
hype), so I really can’t wait to unpack
my vault boy, gorge on some nuke
cola and explore the destroyed land
that is post-nuclear america.

track record with releases, I would
find no benefit in spending my hard-
earned cash so early. Server issues will
definitely be a problem, and I think
that the day-one patch will probably
be a necessity. After all the initial
hype has settled down and all the
initial bugs are patched, you should
be able to decide quite clearly if you
can afford this game and/or your
computer can handle it!

This is the best marketing a game has ever had and in fact ever will have.
