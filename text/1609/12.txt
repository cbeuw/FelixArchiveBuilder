of glasses in Chile’s stunning wine
region
Exploring the Colchagua
Valley in South America
Acouple of months ago I was
just like you: I’d crafted
what I thought at the time
was the perfect route through South
America, cruising merrily along the
gringo trail, diverting occasionally
for the miscellaneous hidden gems I’d
heard about through the grapevine.
But as it turned out there were
several grapevines missing from the
discussion. Enter Chile’s Colchagua
Valley. My initial plan was to call it
a day at the Mendoza Malbecs but,
following several tastings in the area,
my thirst was far from quenched: the
time was clearly ripe to search for
something new.
Colchagua extends across Chile’s
central valley, a beautiful strip of epic
proportions dedicated to traditional
agriculture and winemaking. It is
known for its full-bodied Cabernet
Sauvignons, Syrahs, and Malbecs,
not to mention Carmenere, which
was rediscovered in 1994 and is now
mostly produced in Chile. That said,
there’s a plethora of other excellent
red and white varietals found
throughout the region. Despite being
much closer to the equator than
Europe’s vineyards, the region has
a solid Mediterranean climate, with
the nearby Pacific Ocean bringing
a consistent cooling effect to the
valley. And, perhaps above all, the
Andes help to maintain grape acidity
levels through diurnal temperature
variation, and deliver fresh melted
water into the valley in the form of
the Tinguiririca River.
But it’s obviously not just the
solid science that gives Colchagua
its appeal: aesthetically, the valley
is nothing short of stunning. The
gorgeous landscape is accented with
endless picturesque vineyards, and
the perfect summer days drastically
descend into night skies that are a
stargazer’s paradise. There are plenty
of great hiking options along the
mountain range, achieved either on
horseback or on foot. Meanwhile sun
and surf worshippers will be satisfied
with Pichilemu, just under two
hours from Santa Cruz and “widely
considered the best surfing in South
America year-round” by Fodor’s.
Colchagua is a destination that is
gaining traction every year, and one
that is well worth discovering while it
is still within its prime.
Recommended wineries
Visiting a handful of wineries is
clearly the main event in Colchagua.
The area does continue to maintain
an air of reserve – only a handful
of wineries are currently open to
the public – but I believe that this
only adds to Colchagua’s charm and
hidden gem status. The following
wineries are an excellent starting
point that will provide you with a
solid grounding in what the region
has to offer, including the essential
grape varietals, as well as the contrast
between industrial operations and
smaller-scale outfits.
Montes Winery: This boutique
winery is located in the heart of
Apalta, an area synonymous with
outstanding quality and prestige.
They are also the outfit behind
Chile’s first ultra-premium wine,
Alpha M. Throughout the winery
what stands out is the astounding
attention to detail: the building has
been oriented about the surrounding
landscape according to the principles
of feng shui, while one of Montes’
bottles features exclusive artwork
from Gerald Scarfe, the revered
illustrator behind the iconic cover of
Pink Floyd’s The Wall. The carbon-
neutral winery also has an attached
conservation area dedicated to
preserving local flora and fauna;
meanwhile the barrels receive the soft
whisper of round-the-clock Gregorian
chant to give them – quite literally –
non-stop good vibes.
The Colchagua Museum
As I alluded to earlier, the activities
in Colchagua don’t start and end with
the wonderful wine. Located just off
Santa Cruz’s main square, the Plaza
de Armas, sits Museo Colchagua,

Cruising through
Colchagua
one of the continent’s best private
collections, boasting well-decked
exhibition halls inside a huge colonial
building with a stunning courtyard
attached. The museum encompasses
all one could wish to know about
Chile and elsewhere on the continent,
including palaeontology, pre-
Columbian art, the colonial era, and
subsequent liberation. It is well worth
a few hours – if not a few days – of
your time in Colchagua: everything
is beautifully presented, and finding
exactly what you want is made easy by
following the guided circuit through
the halls.
By far the most impressive
collection is ‘The Big Rescue’, a series
of rooms and tunnels dedicated to
recounting the tale of ‘los 33’, the 33
Chilean men trapped in the San José
mine in 2010, an event that captured
the eyes and hearts of billions around
the globe. The owners and curators
have done a fantastic job of securing
endless memorabilia from the mine
itself, and presenting it in such a way
that really captures the severity and
scale of this iconic event. While there
are endless attractions throughout
Colchagua, the Museo certainly is a
must-see.
Colchagua Wine Tours
Colchagua as a tourist destination
is still somewhat in its infancy. As a
result sourcing reliable information
and professional tour guides is
something of a challenge, particularly
if you’re looking for a good level
of spoken English. Thankfully the
region is now served by a local tour
operator, Colchagua Wine Tours. It
would be difficult to reduce CWT to a
single unique selling point: they offer
completely-customisable tailored
tour packages, knowledgeable native
English-speaking guides, and a well
thought-out pricing system that far
surpasses that offered by rival tour
operators in Santiago. It’s a rarity
to find such a good level of service,
and I have no doubts that CWT will
contribute to Colchagua’s continuing
rise to stardom.
I first ran into CWT’s co-founder
Connie, a US expat, at a wine harvest
festival in a small town in the heart
of Colchagua, and found her to
capture the spirit of CWT perfectly:
enthusiastic, personable, and busy
investigating up-and-coming trends
in the area. Coupled with co-founder
Francisco – the Chilean-born
entrepreneur with a real passion for
putting home-grown businesses on
the map – CWT offer unparalleled
knowledge and an unrivalled quality
of service. Having spent a weekend
with them in the area, I was extremely
impressed with their incredible
attention to deal, ability to seamlessly
stitch together a complicated
itinerary, and willingness to adapt the
plans according to our preferences.
For the perfect Colchagua experience,
CWT is your go-to guide.
