This week a beautiful woman
calls to you in the entrance
of Sainsbury’s. You puff out
your chest, flatten your pitiful
neck beard and engage her
in flirtatious conversation.
Before long she has your
number and bank details and
you are condemned to donate
your monthly stipend to a
charity for cats.

This week you notice that
several Imperial students on
your course appear to have
eye injuries. You offer them
your hand in solidarity, before
noticing the white bones of
your knuckles. It turns out
that you have become the
manifestation of Death and
whomever you touch dies
immediately.
This week you are an
anonymous reader of
horoscopes. Inspired by
Hangman’s call to action, you
send in all twelve horoscopes
and demand they be printed.
Hangman respects that.
Hangman has printed two of
them as a token of this respect.
This week you are Hangman.
You receive all twelve
horoscopes from a new writer,
but most of them are so weird
that you’re unsure whether to
print them. You opt instead to
print a mixture of the original
writer’s, the new writer’s, and
your own. You are promptly
fired for doing a terrible job.
This week you are the
horoscopes writer, and you try
and sneak another relatively
unacceptable horoscope past
Hangman with the phrase “lol
i bet this one gets taken out.”
Hangman fires you and
replaces you with someone
who knows how to use the shift
key.
This week you, too, are the
horoscopes writer. You claim to
have returned, but only write
half the horoscopes.
Hangman doesn’t pay you to
half-ass this crap. Hangman
doesn’t pay you at all.
This week you decide you need
someone to look after your
finances since you need to save
a few quid for next year so you
look around for an accountant.
Luckily there’s an ex-FIFA
president in dire need of a job,
and you end your second year
with an inexplicably larger
sum of money.
This week your friend finally
comes out from the cave in
which he entrenched himself
for revision, only for you to
realise he has become a mole
in this time. At first it is a very
confusing transition for you
to accept him as a mole but
eventually you learn to feed it
worms and you grow to love it.
This week due to the fact that
you have spent so much time
revising really hard for your
first year exam because it’s
extra important, you decide to
brag to other people about how
much revision you did in one
day. They from there on avoid
you because you’re a boring
obnoxious cunt but oh dem
sweet marks.
This week you really fuck up
on your exams. Shit man, you
probably should have revised
a bit harder. I mean, you
couldn’t answer one question
on that paper? Fuck. Looks like
you will be taking a gap year
whilst Imperial decide if they
want to let you back in.
This week the usual writer is
writing the horoscopes due to
Hangman being salty af due
to the fact you had exams and
even though you definitely
told them in advance you
weren’t doing them because
you had exams but it turns out
they don’t seem to remember
that.
This week in response to
the findings of last week’s
sex survey, you realise that
you haven’t been fingered
anywhere on campus and
set out to try to correct this;
however, it seems that the Felix
Editor had the same idea and
unfortunately they seem to be
there before you everytime.
Spooky.
Diary Of a Fresher, aged 19 1/4
Saturday 6th June
I don’t really remember what happened on Friday night, to be honest. After reading about the goat-woman-man
threesome in the sex survey I felt really ill, so I went to 568 and just started drinking. I think Kris tried to
apologise to me at one point, but I just tried to punch him.
Someone told me that I missed, punched Dorothy (the goat one) instead, and then she kicked me in the face.
That’d probably explain why I think I’m missing two of my front teeth. It’s really painful and every time I breathe
it makes a weird whistling noise.
Sunday 7th June
I spent most of the day curled up in bed whistling quietly. It was crap.
Monday 8th June
Well, there’s good news and there’s bad news. I tried submitting one of those ‘mitigating circumstances’ forms
so that I don’t get killed by the lecturers for doing such a shit job in the exams. I still can’t believe I wrote the
words ‘Kris Kraye’ over and over.
I wonder if ‘DP(W) stole both my girlfriends’ is an okay reason to have failed all my exams?
Tuesday 9th June
Apparently it isn’t. I put in my application, and I got an email from the official DP(W) email account telling me that
he was taken my concerns into consideration and hoped I felt better soon. And that Dorothy (both of them) said hi.
What a dick.

News in Brief: Broadcasters in terror of slip-ups as man
named ‘Hunt’ makes headlines again.
No-one was surprised today
when it was revealed that
opening a theme park filled
with live dinosaurs is actually a
terrible idea. Footage has leaked to
the outside world showing dinosaurs
running amok at Jurassic World, a
recently-opened theme park located
on the remote Isla Nubar.
Concerns had been voiced
previously about the logic behind
the decision to not only bring back
dinosaurs but to also then cage them
and put them on display, with several
experts pointing out the inherent
flaws in keeping intelligent animals
caged.
The original owners of the park
had hoped to maintain control of
the population by keeping only
one gender of dinosaur in the park,
although this plan was soon disrupted
by the dinosaurs still finding a way
to breed.
Several experts were invited to
the park before it opened to test the
viability of such a theme, although
the results of their tests have never
been disclosed to the outside world.
Rumours that the tests involved
several individuals being eaten by
dinosaurs remain unconfirmed.
Information on this latest
outbreak at the park is slim, although
Hangman has heard that famous film
star Chris Pratt is on location.
There was an outpouring
of shock today as several
students were arrested for their
participation in a nude photoshoot.
Police swooped on the unsuspecting
students during the early hours of
Thursday morning, following their
suspected attendance at Imperial
College Union’s “CSP Wednesday”
that night.
The photoshoot in question took
place several days before the arrest,
with the participants originally
seeming to believe they had escaped
repercussions. One posted “teaser”
shots from the photoshoot on social
media, before “taunting” those who
complained about the photoshoot’s
location.
The photos are alleged to have
been taken atop the sacred Blackett
Laboratory, causing a campus-wide
outcry at the student’s actions.
Said one anonymous Felix Editor:
“I’ve seen the photos in question, and
I was disgusted. They didn’t even take
it all off. If you’re going to take naked
pics on top of Blackett, at least get
properly naked.”
Hangman spoke to one of the
students involved in the photoshoot,
who asked not to be named (but
did encourage us to print the photo
again).
“We didn’t mean to cause any
offence,” said the anonymous
nudist. “We were told we had to do a
centrefold for Felix, and we thought
that the roof of Blackett would be a
great place to take the photo. You get
some really great views.”
Hangman would like to take this
opportunity to confirm that the
photos do indeed allow you to get
some really great views of [You’re fired
- Ed.]
The police finally made moves on
the students following the publication
of the photos in Felix.
Rumours that the students’
actions are being blamed for
the recent unexpected spate of
unnaturally warm weather are as yet
unconfirmed.
The President of Imperial
College Union stepped down
today, following widespread
accusations of corruption within
the organisation and the subsequent
arrests of several members of his
staff.
Imperial College Union (or ICU, as
it is often referred to) has long had a
reputation for what has at times been
referred to as ‘wheeler-dealing’, with
alleged instances of bribery being rife.
Events came to a head when the
organisation attempted to run a poll
asking students what they thought
the new bar in the Woodward Halls
should be called.
The halls themselves were a major
source of contention, with students
campaigning vigorously against
relocating accommodation to Acton
to little avail.
Police moved in after an
anonymous source tipped them off
to this latest instance of unmitigated
corruption and anti-democratic
principles.
Several members of staff were
placed under arrest in a surprise sting,
timed by officers to coincide precisely
with an all-staff meeting.
The meeting in question, Hangman
has learned, was called to discuss the
accusations of corruption, causing
some observers to comment on the
irony of being arrested for corruption
at such a meeting.
Although the investigation
continues, after being given special
dispensation by the courts Hangman
can now exclusively reveal that the
bar’s name had already been decided,
long before the poll was opened to
students.
Officials at the Union had decided
that the bar was to be dubbed the
‘It’s O’Kaye Bar’, in honour of
sitting Deputy President (Hugs and
Tampons), Kris Kraye, who is also the
incoming Deputy President (Money
and Swag).
It has been suggested that this
choice was influenced by a monthly
donation from a still-anonymous
source, rumoured to be someone
high-up within the Union itself.
Despite this, the Union went ahead
with their poll, claiming that the
student voice would be heard in the
decision, and insisting that “every
vote counts!”
Hangman took their information
on the new bar name to the student
population, asking their opinions
on both the name and the Union’s
attempts at hiding their choice in
faux-democracy.
One student asked us to only refer
to him by his first name, Deputy
President, and told Hangman: “I
think the new name is a fantastic
decision by the Union. Naming the
bar after the champion of the people
Kris Kraye is a magnificent move,
and I can think of no other who is as
deserving as he to have an entire bar
named after him.
The student was less forthcoming
when Hangman pressed him on the
claims of corruption in the process,
replying only “what do you care if I
paid them to name it after me?
“Bloody Felix, always sticking their
nose in other people’s business.”
Hangman wishes to take this
opportunity to agree firmly with
the sentiments expressed by Deputy
President, as Felix are indeed far too
nosy for their own good.
Hangman would also like to point
out that Hangman and Felix aren’t the
same thing, thank you very much.
