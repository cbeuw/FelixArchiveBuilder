Aleksandra Berditchevskaia
heads to the Tate Modern, where
she finds a contemplative stillness
in their celebration of the late
American Abstract Expressionist
Agnes Martin:
The Unbearable
Lightness of
Beauty
If this is the first time you’ve
come across the name Agnes
Martin, you’re in good company.
Encountering her work in the context
of a large museum collection, she is
easy to overlook, since her paintings
really demand that you spend time
with them to get to their essence.
Her pieces also don’t reproduce well,
and I assume it is for this reason that
the Tate Modern has opted to use a
photograph of Martin in the poster
advertising the artist’s first large-scale
retrospective since her death in 2004,
rather than an example of her work.
Only when you remove yourself
from the busy concourse area
and enter into the first palate-
cleansing room of the Tate’s new
show can you begin to establish
the necessary mental framework
through which to gain access to
the work. In this first room we’re
introduced to the quintessential
Agnes Martin: large canvases of
calming pastel washes methodically
contained by faintly drawn ruled
lines. She always considered herself
an Abstract Expressionist, which
may come as a surprise given the
obvious contrasts with the Pollocks,
de Koonings and Rothkos that
the term conjures up. But just as
those artists relied on automatism
as a technique, surrendering
their actions to impulses of the
unconscious, Martin’s grids sprang
from her mind’s eye. And although
she planned the dimensions of her
canvas works with meticulous care,
videos showing her at work depict
an artist who is quick and decisive
in her application of paint. Almost
impulsive in her movements, she is a
very gestural painter, just as her male
contemporaries were.
Martin was interested in painting
something entirely removed from
the physical world. In interviews she
referred to an attempt to capture
internal states – we’re invited to
connect to something vestigial,
the beauty that remains in the
mind when the image of the rose
is taken away. She said of her work
that it was about “light, lightness,
about merging, about formlessness
breaking down form”. Later in her
life, she playfully claimed that she
had given up intellectualising thanks
to a painful parting with Einstein’s
Theory of Relativity, and she always
resisted formal analysis of her
work. It seems ironic then that the
majority of us will cry out for just
such an intellectualising in order to
start understanding these very bare
canvases. We reach for meaning
and guidance, for the theoretical
backdrop; when really Agnes Martin
wants us to clear our minds and
simply to meditate on the paintings.
Only then can we begin to realize our
“full response to this work”.
But who was Agnes Martin? Born
in Canada in 1912, she had a strict
religious upbringing at the hands
of her maternal grandparents. This
childhood went on to shape her
professional struggle with the sin of
‘pride’; throughout her career she was
at pains to resolve a fierce ambition
with a reluctance to embrace the idea
of success. Leaving Canada for the US
to study, she went on to qualify as a
teacher and finally decided to become
an artist at the age of 30. Moving out
to complete further study and live in
New Mexico, she was only persuaded
to return to the art world of New York
when the famous art dealer Betty
Parsons offered to represent her. New
York of the 50s and 60s was a hub of
masculine energy, both in the stark
and formal style of the Minimalists
and the brash, sexual Abstract
Expressionism.
But Agnes Martin aligned herself
to an undercurrent. Her neighbours
and friends at the time were the
subversive young community that
took up residence in the disused
warehouses of Coenties Slip. Here,
amongst the dilapidated workshops
and shipping rubble, artists of a
new generation were finding their
voice. Although they didn’t form
a coherent movement and their
practices remained diverse, they
supported each other throughout
a period that brought the liberty
of experimentation, allowing each
of them to discover their very
singular styles. Many of the artists
making up this group went on to
gain recognition within the larger
art establishment, with names
such as Lenore Tawney, Ellsworth
Kelly, Robert Indiana, and Jack
Youngerman claiming their rightful
place in American art history.
Early on in the exhibition, the Tate
showcases Martin’s works from
this period, and through doing so
provides some insight into the origins
of the grid paintings for which she
is most famous. The intriguing and
ultimately surprising display reveals
sculptural pieces constructed from
the materials that Martin found in
the scrapyards bordering her studio
at Coenties Slip. You sense that
working in 3D gave her a certain
release from the painted form; it
was these works that allowed her
the space to better appreciate the
physicality of shape and structure.
It’s difficult not to think of these
mixed media assemblages as natural
precursors to the development of the
grid, particularly Water 1958, with its
taught linear strings of painted wire.
In fact, the smaller painted works
she was producing at the time were
already exploring manifestations of
repetitive lattices of lines.
Then follows the room where we
encounter some of the earliest grid
paintings produced by Martin. The
year is 1963, and there are only three
canvases on the walls, which the
curators have selected to represent the
vital transition in Martin’s oeuvre.
They are striking in their differences.
Suddenly we start to understand
the potential contained within such
deceptively simple arrangements of
vertical and horizontal lines. Always
working on the same scale of 72 x 72
inches, throughout the 60s Martin
was uncompromising in her subtle
yet assured portrayals of seemingly
banal subjects such as Tree, Rose, and
Morning. The faint pencil lines are
both precise and slightly uneven,
carrying a richness that reveals itself
only after careful inspection. In the
words of the critic Lucy Lippard,
Martin’s works are remarkable
examples of “unrepetitive use of a
repetitive medium”. Such imaginative
use of grids brought the artist much
attention, and increasingly she was
included in group shows, something
she resisted and struggled against. In
fact, it eventually pushed her to give
up painting altogether: in 1967 she
packed up her things and abandoned
New York to travel around the
country for 18 months, before settling
on a remote mesa in New Mexico.
Here she built a house out of logs and
adobe bricks, and led a largely self
sufficient, ascetic lifestyle completely
detached from the art world. She was
only prompted to take up her practice
again 5 years later when a German
gallery commissioned her to produce
a series of screenprints.
The show is curated with great
care by the Tate’s Director of
International Art, Francis Morris,
who has been working towards this
exhibition for many years. We
should be grateful, since as visitors
we benefit from being guided by the
hand and introduced to the artist in
two halves. Split between the North
and South galleries we first witness
an artist finding her form during the
New York period and then, following
her return to painting from 1974,
claiming that form with an assured
confidence. An interconnecting
passageway displaying the 30 German
screenprints guides us between
these two periods. In the North
galleries, the later works are bathed
in natural light from the windows
facing the Thames, as if echoing the
openness and wild prosperity of the
New Mexican landscape in which
they were produced. Many of these
paintings from the 1970s make
up whole series, an approach that
allowed Martin to explore certain
themes in greater depth.
The turbulence of her final painting
Untitled 2004, on display in the show,
is strangely at odds with others from
the period. The greys of the coloured
sections seem almost haphazardly
applied when compared to her
signature smooth washes. Yet, this
work is her self-selected epitaph.
A few days before her death, she
requested that her gallerist and long-
time friend Arne Glimcher returned
to her studio and cut two of the
canvases of the three paintings she
had left there. An uncompromising
self-editor, she had always cut the
majority of her output over the course
of her career, leaving only the works
she was entirely satisfied with. The
selection policy seems baffling. It is
claimed that she aimed for exactitude
and perfection in her execution, yet
some of the paintings in the show
reveal imprecision in the grids and
the occasionally ‘messy’ reality of
using very liquid washes. Actually, it
is these revelations that hint at the
intrinsic humanity behind the higher
concepts she was trying to capture
and end up feeling like the most
emotionally resonant aspect of the
work. In an interview, Glimcher has
drawn comparisons between the final
painting and one she had produced
during the 1970s, Trumpet. Both are
‘stormy’ and unsettling, in spite of
the use of Martin’s signature pastel
palette. And so we’re left with an
enigmatic final statement, a reference
to an earlier piece, from a painter who
always insisted on letting her work
speak for itself.
Agnes Martin is on at the Tate Modern
until 11th
October.
