Students told they will receive full marks if they had
pointed out it could not be solved
Physics students have been left
confused and annoyed over an
exam question that was proved
to be impossible to answer, adding to
the plethora of mistakes in papers sat
by students from multiple year groups
in the department this term.
Second year students who sat the
Quantum Mechanics exam last
Friday found that a 15-mark question
wave functions was impossible to
answer correctly.
The question, worth 15% of the
exam, was part of a larger section of
the paper about the potential energy
of a quantum system.
The question asked students to
prove a certain energy level could
exist within a specific system with
predefined limitations.
It then asked for students to find
the solution to a variant of the
Schrödinger’s Equation for the energy
level in question.
However such limitations meant
that it was impossible for the deter-
mined energy level to actually exist
within the system, thus rendering the
question impossible to answer.
The impossible exam question was
reported to the course instructor,
Professor Andrew Jaffe. Jaffe then
told all second year students in an
email sent on Monday that they were
aware that many “put a lot of effort
into the problem, and we very much
want to take that into account in our
marking.”
Jaffe stated that they would be
awarding marks for those who at-
tempted to set up the premise of the
answer, and that: “Any student who
did note that it was impossible even
without the full algebra will of course
receive full marks.”
