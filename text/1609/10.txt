The wonderful world of film
Sir Christopher Lee passes
away
Veteran actor Sir Christopher
Lee died aged 93, it was
revealed on Thursday.
The star of many films, Lee passed
away on Sunday at Chelsea and
Westminster Hospital after being
admitted with respiratory difficulties
and heart failure.
Lee had an incredible career, with
performances in films ranging from
the classic Hammer Horrors to the
epic Lord of the Rings and Star Wars
franchises.
His big break came in 1957, where
he appeared as the Monster in The
Curse of Frankenstein under director
Terence Fisher.
The role proved a springboard
to further appearances under the
Hammer banner, most notably as
Count Dracula, a role he would play a
total of nine times.
While with Hammer, Lee also
played the likes of Mummy, Fu
Manchu and Rasputin.
Away from Hammer, his large roles
included Lord Summerisle in the
classic 1973 horror The Wicker Man,
and his first big franchise appearance
as Bond villain Francisco Scaramanga
in Roger Moore’s second outing The
Man with the Golden Gun.
His other main franchises came
later on, first as Saruman the White
in Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings
trilogy (a role he then reprised in the
Hobbit trilogy), then as Count Dooku
in Episode II: Attack of the Clones and
Episode III: Revenge of the Sith of the
Star Wars series.
Lee also had an extremely active
career outside of acting, not least in
the world of music.
Lee was made a CBE in 2001, before
being knighted in 2009.
Chris Hemsworth joins
female Ghostbusters
Paul Feig, director of the all-
female take on beloved classic
Ghostbusters, has announced his
latest piece of casting via Twitter.
Feig made the announcement
with the words “our receptionist.
#whoyougonnacall”, stating pretty
much outright that Hemsworth will
likely be taking on some form of
Annie Potts’ role as Janine Melnitz in
both original films.
Deadline did some snooping
through casting assignments, digging
up a reference to a “male tech
assistant”, which may well be the job
Hemsworth has landed.
The actor, most famous for his
appearances as Thor in the Marvel
franchises, joins a line-up that
includes Kristen Wiig, Melissa
McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Leslie
Jones.
The film is being pushed as its own
story, not just another spin on the
original tale of the ‘busters, and is
currently targeting a 2016 release
date.
Before that, Hemsworth is
appearing in the new Vacation film,
landing on August 21, while future
co-star Melissa McCarthy is on
screens now in Spy.
Female Jump Street gets
more writers
Much like Ghostbusters, the
Jump Street series is getting
its own female-led spin-off,
and Sony has adopted one of cinema’s
new favourite tactics: having multiple
writers working on separate scripts
for the same film at the same time.
Warner/DC have been toying with
the system for the Wonder Woman
film (amongst others on their slate),
and now Sony have jumped on the
bandwagon by hiring Wendy and
Lizzie Molyneux to draw up a draft
idea for the film.
They join Lucia Aniello and Paul
W. Downs, who were hired by Sony in
April to get cracking on ideas.
The Molyneuxs (not convinced
that’s how to pluralise their surname)
have previously worked on the likes
of Bob’s Burgers, with multiple scripts
currently in development (including
Hot Stuff at Dreamworks).
The main thrust of the franchise
is also going strong, with Rodney
Rothman working on a 23 Jump Street,
and continued mutterings of a Jump
Street/Men in Black crossover, which
Sony has been pushing for since the
success of the sequel.
There’s no news on the story or
any real details for any of the three
projects - not yet, anyway.
Spectre teaser released
The latest James Bond film,
Spectre, got a new teaser trailer
during the NBA finals on
Tuesday night, marking the start
of the steady increase of publicity
materials for the highly-anticipated
film.
A teaser trailer for the 24th
film in
the James Bond franchise made an
appearance back in March, and the
first half of this new trailer recycles
much of that first glimpse.
From there, it’s a smash-grab of
smash-cuts that give tiny glimpses
of what’s in store for Daniel Craig’s
Bond.
Ben Whishaw’s Q is briefly visible,
as well as both new Bond girls Lea
Seydoux and Monica Bellucci. There’s
also a shadow-cloaked visit from
Christoph Waltz’s Franz Oberhauser
- long rumoured (and denied) to be a
reincarnation of Ernst Stavro Blofeld,
the evil supervillain in charge of the
shadowy, titular Spectre organisation.
The major players from the hit
23rd
entry Skyfall are all returning,
including the likes of Ralph
Fiennes as M and Naomie Harris as
Moneypenny, as well as director Sam
Mendes.
Spectre’s script has been penned by
John Logan and Neal Purvis & Robert
Wade, the men responsible for much
of the modern resurgence of Bond.
Spectre is due for release on
November 6.
