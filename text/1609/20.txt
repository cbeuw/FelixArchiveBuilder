Summer Exhibition 2015: A Dizzy,
Kaleidoscope Explosion of Art
We send Indira Mallik along to the Royal Academy’s annual
celebration of art, where she is overwhelmed by the range of
pieces on display
Each year, the Royal Academy
heralds in summer with
the Summer Exhibition, a
showcase of the work of the Royal
Academicians, a select group of
‘honorary’ academicians, and –
uniquely – entries from the public.
Each year it serves up a feast of work
from all different aesthetics, work of
different media, and curates into the
‘best of the year so far’. This year is no
exception.
Co-ordinated by Michael Craig-
Martin CBE, the galleries have taken
on the vivid peacock hues of his
paintings. The colour experience
begins before you’ve even entered
the galleries, where Jim Lambie has
decanted the London Tube Map
onto the main staircase, creating
a signature floor installation of
kaleidoscope-coloured lines in
vinyl tape that distort the space
and pulse with pure energy in the
traditional Victorian space. The
galleries themselves have been
unconventionally painted in
paint-box colours: bubblegum pink,
turquoise, and ultramarine – it
shouldn’t work but it does. It has
raised a few eyebrows, admits head of
the Summer Exhibition Edith Davey,
but even the sceptics were won
around in the end. It feels like a true
celebration of the art that is stacked
on the walls.
Given the colour of the back canvas
itself, perhaps it is unsurprising
that the works that really stand
out are the ones in monochrome.
Emma Stibbon’s stark paintings of
Iceland strike a bright note against
the brilliance of the walls, with the
cold Nordic light streaming out from
them. Further on, the print room
is similarly full on monochrome
gems, and is curated by Norman
Ackroyd, one of the greatest masters
of the form. Several of his own
prints hang in the room flanking the
main archway alongside some tiny
Tracey Emin animal prints. Emin’s
work is unusually restrained: sparse
lines delineate rabbits and badgers,
reminiscent more of a modern
Beatrix Potter than her previous
work. The focus is not on these big
names however, but rather on bigger
pieces by less well known artists:
Adaptation by Ade Adesina shows a
huge ship sailing through a densely
populated city on train tracks; in
Questions by the same artist, The Taj
Mahal, St Paul’s, The Parthenon all
appear in a glorious amalgamation
of all the world’s most recognisable
landmarks whilst a whale flies
through the sky, a zeppelin fashioned
out of pure whimsy.
Craig-Martin was determined that
sculpture should have a prominent
stage this year, and The Lecture
Hall, is a testament to this ambition.
Of 118 works exhibited in this
space, the majority are sculpture; in
addition, the halls are punctuated
with commanding pieces, such as
Tim Shaw’s Erebus (Man of Fire III)
which makes a lasting impression.
Shaw has conjured up rippling
muscles and outstretched limbs
with an electrifying presence from
painted foam, polyethene, and steel.
Other featured artists include Anish
Kapoor, Geoffrey Clarke, and Neil
Jefferies.
Architecture, usually placed
centrally, has this year been
segregated to the Large Weston
Room, which can give the sense of the
work being included as somewhat of
an afterthought. Happily, the room,
curated by Ian Ritchie, houses some
of the exhibition’s most intriguing
and unique works. Ian Ritchie
started with the theme of inventive
landscapes, and Norman Ackroyd
features once again with his prints
of the Galapagos, his works acting
as quiet, traditional foil to the other
pieces around the room. In Canvey
Island, the architects Nic Clear, Mike
Aling, Hyun Jun Park, and Simon
Withers have created the model of a
gold mine; viewers can look into the
Gallery III of the Summer Exhibition 2015 Photo: David Parry, Royal Academy of Arts
depths of the mine, staggered crops of
wood and plastic that reveal glinting
polished bronze representing the gold
at the bottom. Above this piece hangs
Dame Zaha Hadid’s vision of Beijing
Airport.
Architecture is so rarely featured in
any other gallery shows that it feels
truly special to have it here. Revealed
are visions of the future, such as in
Lord Rogers of Riverside’s model
Feed the World, where power station
chimneys have been reclaimed
as food growing greenhouses; in
Laurence Pinn, Ben Kirk, and Andrew
Diggle’s Urban Flora Propagation Field
Box, the architects envisage a way to
conserve bees in urban spaces. One
of the most conceptual pieces and
one of the most humorous is Tale of
the Washer, in which Tim Robinson
relates the story of the missing washer
from the Hubble telescope, which cost
NASA millions to replace.
Even though the exhibition could
be described as innovative, and
exciting, it hasn’t escaped the touch
of the bizarre. One of the finest
examples of such is Clancy Gebler
Davies’ cilice made of her own hair.
Conceptually, it may be a meditation
on the use of hair shirts in religious
practice as an act of penance, but
in reality the work is very little else
but unsightly and ever so slightly
disturbing.
There are far too many stand out
pieces to mention them all, but
Grayson Perry’s large tapestry of
the couple he built his house for in
Essex is exhibited in the small works
room despite being several feet in
both height and width. As with all
the other works of art in the Summer
Exhibition it is on sale – for £62,000.
The Emin animal prints, £1,250 a
pop, are guaranteed to sell out in the
first few hours, and Gebler Davies’
own hair calice has already sold out,
according to the RA website. There’s
no accounting for taste.
The Summer Exhibition, which has
ran uninterrupted each year since
1795, is one of the most unique
exhibitions in the world. Yet in trying
to be too many things – perhaps to
please too many people in catering for
all tastes – in trying to fit in as much
of painting, sculpture, mixed media,
as possible, it never quite establishes
its own identity. It houses over 1000
works, selected from 12,000 that
have been sent in, but there is no
overarching theme to tie the galleries
together and present it as a cohesive
whole. Craig Martin’s colour scheme,
though refreshing and inventive is
too weak to sustain all 13 rooms, each
with different personalities. Each
hang is particular to the room and
the academician who has curated it.
Whilst some rooms are filled sparsely,
each piece existing in a synergy with
the rest of the room, in other places,
the room is crammed to the rafters,
a cacophony of sights and colours
that can be at times overwhelming.
There are so many pieces that it
seems unlikely that three or even four
visits would be enough to cover the
breadth of work on display. At times
it feels as if the exhibition consists of
through multiple shows all somehow
interconnected in a colourful
labyrinth. It’s entirely charming, but
nevertheless it does leave you feeling
a little unmoored, unsure where
would be the best place to linger, and
which spaces to move through.
The final room of the exhibition is
definitely a place to take a breather.
It exhibits the life’s work of Tom
Phillips, whose alteration of the
Victorian novel A Human Document
began in the 1960s. Pages upon pages
of The Humument line the walls of
Gallery X, each a tiny silk screened
jewel. The Humument is part painting,
part illustration, and a considerable
part erasure poetry. The work is
based on reimagining and altering
pages of a salvaged Victorian novel;
certain phrases have been picked out
and the others hidden in translucent
paint to create fragmentary poems
that are reminiscent of ancient
texts by Sappho or Catullus, where
phrases have been lost. The absence
of words defines the meaning as
much as the words that remain.
Speaking about his work, Phillips
has said ‘[I] plundered, mined, and
undermined its text to make it yield
the ghosts of other possible stories.’
This work alone could have sustained
an exhibition, and one suspects
it’s less the quality of the work and
more Phillips’ relative obscurity
when compared to Perry, Emin,
and Akroyd, that means that the
Humument has been tacked on to the
end of the Summer Exhibition rather
than honoured by a solo celebration.
However, this arrangement does
guarantee that Phillip’s work will
find a larger audience than if he had
struck out on his own, and that can
only be a good thing.
The Summer Exhibition 2015 is
an exuberant celebration of art,
and drifting through each of the
thirteen galleries can is something
of a SparkNotes of the zeitgeist of
art in Britain, filtered through the
capable hands of the Academy’s most
influential members. But don’t go
expecting to absorb it all. The RA
have published for the first time this
year, an online catalogue of each
of the works in the exhibition, in
addition there are virtual tours given
by Michael Craig Martin, Tracey
Emin, novelist Sebastian Faulks,
and Cath Kidston with more to be
added over the summer; handy if you
want to plan your trip or catch some
of the work you missed. However
comprehensive, the online version
cannot possibly hope to rival the real
thing; the Summer Exhibition remains
something to be enjoyed in person; a
true Experience with a capital ‘E’.
The Summer Exhibition 2015, this
year co-ordinated by Michael Craig-
Martin CBE RA, is on at the Royal
Academy until 16th
August.
Tickets £13.50; concessions available.
