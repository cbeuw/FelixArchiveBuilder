quantity of piss-taking at her

This is the penultimate issue of
Felix; we’ve got one last issue
to go before we break up for
the summer. We’ll return in the
first week of the next term, with a
new editor, which will be an exciting
change for the paper.
In this week’s issue we’ve covered
the news of the many mistakes that
have been spotted in the Physics
exams that students have been
sitting all term. The mistakes range
from missing signs and symbols and
poorly drawn diagrams, through to
a question that was impossible to
solve, and left a lot of students angry,
although perhaps not surprised.
Speaking to members of staff in the
department, it seems there may be a
flaw in the system as opposed to the
fault of one individual. Not only that,
it is probably not a problem unique
to Physics, but is an issue nonetheless
when factored into the bigger
picture of perceived apathy towards
undergraduate students.
In the past five(!) years I have
spent at Imperial, by far the biggest
complaint I have heard from students
about this university is not the lack
of girls, boys, beer or all of the above,
but actually the sense of disconnect
between the undergraduate students
and Imperial itself.
Typos in exams give an impression
of a lack of attention towards
the exams that students spend
hours poring over textbooks and
PowerPoints for. The fact that
students in their undergraduate year
spend so much time, not to mention
money, in preparing and taking these
exams, it is all the more annoying
that it seems that the university
haven’t given the exam the same due
care students do.
Not only that, but sitting exams is
an experience that can be made all the
more stressful if you start to doubt
yourself over an exam question. No
matter how many hours you commit
to the library as a first year student,
having an exam script with a question
containing an error can turn what
you know on its head, as what is
seemingly more likely to be wrong;
your notes or the script?
Students aren’t science machines
(just like the professors that write
the exams, obviously), and even if we
see a mistake during a test, it takes
more than our own confidence in
our knowledge to speak up and say
something about it.
That impossible question may have
been only worth 15% of the marks,
but I am sure a greater proportion
of the students would have worried
about on the way home after the
exam.
Mistakes can contribute to students
feeling neglected, as can often be the
case when feedback is late or non-
existent, or emails go ignored.
The Physics department seem
genuinely apologetic over the errors,
and obviously no-one is perfect. I
hope that their empathy is felt by the
students however, as if they are just
offered simple scaling or a few extra
marks here or there, this feeling of
disconnection may continue past
exams and even after students leave.
