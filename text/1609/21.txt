Violence and Son: Dark, Darker, Darkest
Jack Steadman returns to the Royal Court for their visceral new play
Iwalked into the Royal Court’s
Violence and Son knowing virtually
nothing about what I was letting
myself in for.
As it turns out, this was probably
for the best.
What little I did know consisted
of the protagonist being called
Liam, him being 17, liking Doctor
Who and having to live with his dad
(nicknamed ‘Violence’) after his mum
dies. Turns out it’s set in Wales, too.
Definitely didn’t know that.
The set does nothing to help give
any clues about what’s going on: rings
of plastic garden chairs surround the
stage space, bordered by a knee-high
wall.
Inside, the contents of the living
room of a dingy flat sit. A couple of
Doctor Who toys sit, one unopened,
one not. A few Doctor Who DVDs sit
underneath a TV set. Dangling above
the set are fluorescent lights, arranged
in a hexagon. It looks suspiciously
like it might be borrowing design
inspiration from a certain time-
travelling blue box.
If, like me, you’re starting to sense
a theme here, you’re correct. Doctor
Who plays a big part in this show – at
least, it does to begin with.
The lights dim, and Liam (David
Morst) appears, dressed as Matt
Smith’s Doctor.
He waves a sonic screwdriver
around, and the lights descend,
forming a TARDIS-lite console.
It’s all a bit silly, a bit weird, a bit
adorable – and wholly disarming.
This weird dream-state where Liam
faffs around in a Doctor Who-based
state of mind marks the scene changes
in the play, allowing for a brief respite
from the intense domestic disputes
that otherwise dominate proceedings.
They don’t seem to add much, and
with designer Cai Dyfan opting for
a static set there’s no real call for
physical movements of set – the only
change that ever has to be made is
done in the interval anyway.
They’re the only weak point in the
whole thing, proving to be nothing
but a fancy light show acting as a
distraction from the real goings-on.
The real goings-on in question are
utterly absorbing, revolving around
Liam’s relationships with the three
other members of the cast.
There’s Jen (Morfydd Clark), the
pretty girl he clearly has a crush on,
his dad Rick (Jason Hughes), with
whom he has nothing in common,
and Suze (Siwan Morris), Rick’s
current squeeze.
The script quickly sets up just who
these people are, and how they’ve
come to all be in the same flat, and
then just as quickly starts pulling
apart the very fabric of that setup.
Nothing is ever exactly what it
seems in this play, and at every
moment there’s a prickling unease
that everything could turn, and go
horribly, horribly wrong.
There’s a spark of wit running
through the whole thing, providing
a gentle humour that gives way
to horrifying, brutal outbursts,
before just as quickly turning into
something that feels awfully like a
rom-com.
In lesser hands, this could well feel
jarring, a series of constant tonal
shifts that only serve to throw the
entire audience off-balance and leave
them feeling apart from the action.
None of that is the case here.
The rapid changing in the way
the play presents itself never
feels anything less than natural,
the delicate power balances and
relationships all feeling impossibly
real.
The relationship between Liam
and Jen is at the centre of all this,
constantly shifting before the
audience’s eyes.
At times cute, at other times
slightly concerning, it’s also subject to
the worrying influence of Rick.
His interference in his son’s love
life manifests as advice, what he
would do if he were Liam, and it all
sounds horrific. And to begin with,
it looks like it’s backfired, as Jen runs
out. But then it very, very quickly
starts to piece itself back together, and
the scary, overwhelming Rick begins
to sound like the voice of reason.
It’s an initially subtle shift in power
that works marvellously, and it’s one
that is constantly broken and re-
forged throughout the play.
The underlying plot for much of
the play isn’t particularly interesting,
appearing as just another ‘boy fancies
girl who doesn’t fancy him back’
story, but it’s the wonderful way the
script handles the characters involve
that sell it.
The constant, nagging fear that
Rick – the man who seems so
wrong, so violent – might just be the
man who proves to be right. It’s a
terrifying thought, and the play tugs
so insistently on that thread that it
becomes all-consuming, impossible
to ignore.
The emotion keeping you trapped
in your seat slowly changes from
curiousity in what will happen next to
fear of what will come to pass. A well-
founded fear, at that.
It’s not an easy job for the cast to
handle, not least when there are only
four of them to begin with.
Every member of the cast plays
their part admirably, and these are
four flawless performances.
Siwan Morris is the most short-
changed of the four, with Suze being
both the weakest and most thankless
part.
Suze’s shifts in opinions feel the
most forced, more a result of the
story’s needs than a natural character
progression, but she handles them
well.
Morfydd Clark is alluring and
adorable as Jen, while David
Morst handles his character’s arc
wonderfully. It’s Jason Hughes
who dominates the space, though,
physically and otherwise.
Rick is a viciously physical being,
but there’s an animalistic intelligence
beneath all that – where Liam is quick
with words, Rick is quick with actions.
The omnipresent threat that
Rick presents is never undersold by
Hughes, nor is it oversold. It’s played
perfectly. It’s all played perfectly.
Violence and Son was in the
unenviable position of following on
from Who Cares in the Royal Court’s
Jerwood Theatre Upstairs.
It’s nowhere near as nakedly
political as that work (which also
featured directing work from Hamish
Pirie, who takes sole directorial
control here), and it makes very
different use of the space.
But Violence and Son still has
something to say – originally
something on a far more personal
level, but as the unexpected ending
comes crashing in, leaving a trail of
destruction in its wake, it lands with a
message that feels painfully urgent.
It’s something that needs to be
screamed from the rooftops, but to do
that, now, would spoil the play.
It’s a message that can only be
delivered wrapped up in this entire
package, as the build-up is as essential
as the pay-off.
Go and see it. I urge you.
Violence and Son is at the Jerwood
Theatre Upstairs, Royal Court Theatre
until 11th
July.
Tickets from £15 (for students),
available online.
