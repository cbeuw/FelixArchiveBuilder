Oscar Wilde's play was directed by
Loveday Ingram for Leap Before
You Look Productions. It was
staged at the White Bear Theatre in
Kennington which is linked to a
cosy pub with the same name. The
theatre is in a room behind the pub,
with two rows of seats on two sides
of the room, the rest of the room
being the stage. Accordingly, the
atmosphere is very intimate and
intense, which was fortified by a
musician, Clive Bell, who played
Middle Eastern instruments, and the
background which was hung out
with cloths.
Although Oscar Wilde's play is
based on the biblical story, he
turned Salome into a selfish,
malicious monster who couldn't
bear to be rejected by Jokanaan and
hence wants his head although
Herod begged her to have all kind
of other things instead. Well, Oscar
Wilde has a reputation of misogyny
- as has the Bible. (There, Salome's
name isn't mentioned at all;
probably the whole story has been
made up anyway. Indeed it is
known that Herodias had a daughter
with this name; however, it is
believed that John the Baptist was
executed because he was considered
politically dangerous - and this was
by Herod Antipas and not Herod the
Great, as often believed.) Anyway,
as a play it is certainly interesting;
Julie Hewlett performed a daring
Dance of the Seven Veils, and Peter
Marinkeras Herod was most
convincing. It was an enjoyable
performance in pleasant conditions.

Crazy for Y o u (Preview)
An hour's worth of tantalising
highlights from the hit Broadway
musical Crazy For You (previewing
from 18th February, opening
March 9th) bodes well. The all
singing, all dancing, all frothy
costumed legs-up-to-their-armpits
extravaganza will be welcome relief
from the grim, rags and mono-tune
pseudo-opera that is the current
vogue. In time honoured fleet-
footed-forties-style the slick
Gershwin numbers are accented by
Susan Stroman's ravishing
choreography. As long as the
female lead gets some singing
lessons in the next two weeks I think
this one's going to be great.

King Lear
It's a good play—and I mean that,
yes, me, hater of all things old and
sacred. It can be really moving and
quite funny and very, very wordily
clever. This production is a bit out
of the ordinary, so I will have to
mention the spanking, the urinating
on someone's head, the bag lady
with a Sainsbury's (no, no luvvies,
Waitrose) trolley and the
transvestite. Right, now that I've
done that, no, Denis Nilson didn't
make a guest appearance. There
Felix 956
were some fab performances—the
sisters—especially big sis (Lia
Williams) were ace, Kent (Philip
Jackson) was brill and Edmund
(Adrian Dunbar) the bastard, was
good, but a bit wierd at times. Lear
(Tom Wilkinson) was a bit of a let
down when push came to shove.
My main gripe is that two scenes
that are really important, the storm
and the war bit/finale were
wearisome. It's at these points that
the props, costumes, set,
pantomime-style storm effects (oh
5 February 1993
please) and other peripheral stuff
just irritates you if the acting isn't
strong enough. It was quite strong,
but sadly just missed the mark. I'm
glad to have seen it though; it's an
interesting experience if you know
the play and an inviting and
fathomable one if you don't. How
do I know? I just do.
