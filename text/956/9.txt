On a bike and a prayer
Chris Riley starts across the Atlas mountains and discovers that cycling
wasn't such a good idea after all
We left the metropolis on a chilly,
crisp morning where you could see
your breath. We peddled out
towards Anergui, three hours after
Said left. It was still only 8.45am
as we passed him plodding in front
of his mule.
We peddled on up the little
donkey paths that climb out of the
Imilchil basin, keeping well ahead
of the mule to avoid scarring the
beast, which unfortunately seemed
to have a phobia about bikes. The.
poor animal was loaded with two
straw weaved panniers which
bulged with packs, sleeping bags
and mats. It swayed from side to
side like some lolloping camel. As
the track climbed our front wheels
bounced uncontrollable and our rear
wheels span uselessly, forcing us to
dismount and shoulder the things.
With buckling, bowing and
stumbling legs we thanked our
insight and lack of pride for renting
a guide and mule for the bags.
The summit of the pass of Tizi
bought no relief, as the ground
dropped more steeply than it had
risen. There was no mule track. The
route consisted of a steep rock
strewn river bed - freshly sprinkled
with giant sized debris. The mule
and Said disappeared like free-
fallers from a plane, leaving us to
trail blaze alone. Having carried my
bike up, I was damned if was going
to carry it down again, like some
awkward piece of luggage. By
leaning back behind and below the
saddle it was possible to bounce
over anything and everything -
although by the end of the day this
approach was to cost me five
broken teeth on my chainset and a
broken spoke on my front wheel.
Andrea and Stephane preferred a
more cautious descent - trying to
preserve their bikes. They seemed
more conscious of the fact that their
wasn't a bike shop in a million miles
of where we were; and there were
still over 800km left.
The bottom of the descent
brought us to the river, winding its
muddy way through the Atlas. We
followed its summer starved trickle
up stream and round its golf- green
banks nestling in the red dry rocks
like a vein of life. Stopping on these
banks for a lunch of bread and
sardines, we scrounged some tea off
a shepherd boy.
As we finished our yoghurts, the
rain started to spit down on us. Said
immediately started to fluster and
fuss explaining that the river would
flood very quickly. We donned our
waterproof gear and peddled
through the brook upstream a bit
further and then across the muddy
fields of crops lining the growing
river. Other shepherds materialised,
their large, unwieldy herds spilling
over the cliffs and crags like spilt
treacle.
Little stone dwellings - like
Cornish tin-cutters cottages - sat
below the heavy sky and awe-struck
people peered from the doorways at
us, three madmen on bikes in the
storm. The rain grew stronger and
turned to hail which hammered on
my felt hat and pinged off my
handlebars and frame. Stephane and
I fought on, heads bowed to shelter
from the sting of the storm. Andrea
was flagging behind, her asthma
holding her back as she fought to
force the bike through the quagmire
of ground squirming beneath the
tyres.
The storm passed and the sky
lightened briefly. We stopped to let
Said catch up. He arrived and shook
his head to dry his hair, like some
big shaggy Afghan hound. The land
ahead rolled gently upwards in vast
open short-cropped grassy slopes
walled in by steep red crags -
darkening in a blackening sky
ahead. We were aiming for a large
crag at the far end of the valley,
where we were to pitch the tent. As
we passed through the valley
nomads swarmed down from the
crags above, neglecting their flocks
to come and investigate our convoy.
Behind the crags, a previously
steel grey sky had blackened
beyond recognition of day. The
blackness laid a path for a
monstrous electric-storm which
swept in like an evil spirit released
from the Ark of the Covenant - with
earth-shaking thunder claps and
photographic flashes of sheet
lightening. We watched like rabbits,
hypnotised by the lights of a car, as
Said struggled to get a tent up. The
light show was followed by layers
of hail - the size of-birds eggs. It
grew steadily heavier and harder,
until the noise on the tent was too
loud to shout above, and the ground
was white and icy.
When we finally unzipped the
tent, a white-out blizzard scene met
our eyes - the golf-green valley
covered in a foot of hail, with a red
torrent of uncontrollable water
gushing Nile-like down the centre.
Drenched donkeys and soaked
sheep hobbled past with numbed
hooves as if towards a promised
Ark.
Day two of this pass bought a vast
stony desert plateau. Football sized
boulders sat stuck in a smooth red
mud that coated the wheels and
clung to the brakes. Between these
stretches were huge tables of
limestone and basalt. We carried
and bounced the cursed bikes for
over two hours to cross it and
descend the other side to a tight and
sinuous river gorge. Climbing up
the other side we hung the bikes
across our shoulders again, front
wheel and handlebars bumping on
the stomach. At the shadeless burnt
summit, we had to stop to patch up
bleeding knees, elbows and fingers.
We had used a lot of water to
prepare the Tajine stew the night
before, and now only had half a litre
left between the four of us for the
rest of the day.
It was almost midday when we
left, and we managed to cycle
lengthy stretches which took us up
to the stunning ridge above our
destination village of Anergui. We
stood on the edge at 3953 metres.
The village below was at 1465m; a
difference as great as the height of
Ben Nevis.
To our dismay the descent was
more draining than the ascent or the
crossing of the plateau. For almost
four hours back wheels skidded and
bucked with locked brakes and front
wheels jittered and jumped.
Clenched fists and taught fraught
brake cables left our hands numbed
and trembling. The mule fell twice
in front of us, and Said twice as
well. I lost count of my tumbles.
Our room in Anergui was
overwhelmingly spacious after the
tent the night before. The floors
were carpeted, the walls clean and
white, and the ceiling adorned with
a pleated blue plastic sheet. The
tiniest three month old kitten
scrambled and tumbled about the
place, as it took sanctuary in our
luggage from the strutting bantams
that periodically strayed into the
room.
Stephane chased the birds
provocatively round the floor in a
clumsy waltz as I tried to tune a SW
radio we'd discovered into
something newsy and informative.
We settled for France-and-air and
a music show of fluctuating volume.
The Beegees crackled in a corner
as we wrote our journals and played
chess until the light from the candles
died.
