Stargazing
Yesterday (Tuesday 2nd) was
apparently a major astrological
event. For those who know
anything about the meaning of the
position of the planets etc. Uranus
and Neptune were in Capricorn
with Mars in opposition. The last
time the planets were lined up thus,
some 170+ years ago, Napoleon
died. So who died was really
important?

Depeche Mode. Depeche bloody
Mode! Of all the famous, talented
rock groups in the world, IC radio
choose one that can sing as badly
as their name sounds. The only
thing that keeps me listening is the
unique way that something always
goes wrong. What's this? God spare
me please! A planned live broadcast
from the R C S Piss-Artists
Convention in the JCR. Steve (at
least I think it's Steve) will be
interviewing a few ex-sober
students, to try to convey what's
occurring in the JCR. What's
occurring? Picture this: lots of
students and cheap beer. No active
imagination needed here and no
outside broadcast neither.

Papers go up next Monday (8th) for
Felix 956
the Sabb Elections. Will Chris run
for president again, assisted by
Ricky-ticky-slicky-mickey-nicky-
nacky-wacky-baccy Bilby? With a
name that long, would you? Will
the Hon Sec position be filled by
someone with a decent dress sense
for 1993-94? And will Jonty
volunteer for another year of late
nights and sweating and straining in
the Felix office. That's nothing to
do with being Felix editor, it's part
of his private life (according to the
graffiti on a particular set of toilets
in the college).

Opinion
5 February 1993
Broadsheet editor, to give us a few
hours to settle our differences. Why
not agree to differ and leave things
as they are? I have made a rule of
not slagging them off ever again and
still they insist on continuing the
argument. Anyway, who gives a
fuck! Not I, because I am still
fuming over the attempted bondage
between me and someone
pretending to be Rachel. Who ever
you are, you wasted your fucking
money and I hope you become
sterile, miserable, fat, poor,
unwanted, mentally deficient and
homeless.

Defending the faith
Dear Jonty,
It was with shock and outrage that
I read Gavin Pearson's complain
regarding ICU receptionists. Most
of us who frequent the Union are
aware of M r Pearson's offending
manner and can regard him with the
respect he deserves—none. I do feel
that as Cathy and Michelle cannot
comment upon this letter
themselves someone should stand
up for them and set the matter to
rights for all students.
Firstly Cathy and Michelle are

two of the most important people in
the Union and we should give them
the respect they are due. They often
have a difficult job continually
repeating Union rules to every
student who wishes to book
vans/rooms or replace Union cards
etc. They are always blamed and
treated unjustly when the student
cannot get their way, Cathy and
Michelle only try to uphold the
rules laid down to make the Union
fair. I can quite understand them
getting stressed when rude insolent

students not unlike M r Pearson
barge into the Union demanding
immediate service.
Cathy and Michelle are
figureheads of the Union to most of
its students and so always are
blamed for its faults. It is not
surprising they feel down as very
few students thank them for their
help. We only notice them when
things go against us when in fact
Cathy and Michelle are most
helpful to the maximum of their
ability, within Union regulations.
If perhaps M r Pearson bowed his
head and thanked them for all their
help instead of producing sexist,
rude and unsubstantiated comments
he would receive a better reception
in the future.
Let me take this opportunity on
behalf of all of us who have had
pleasant dealings with Michelle and
Cathy to thank them for their help
and cheery smiles to which M r
Pearson is blind.
Thanks Cathy and Michelle,
Lorna Mountford, Physics 2.
