Worlds A p a r t
I liked this play for two main
reasons: The first is that it
successfully took the piss out of the
British Government and secondly
because it took the piss out of the
new immigration procedure at an
airport, which was devised by the
British Government. I'm not anti-
government and do not strive for an
Felix 956
anarchic environment, but it is
refreshing and healthy to see British
writers exploit serious errors in our
leaders' policies.
Worlds Apart does no good for
the people of Yorkshire since the
head of the immigration is
portrayed as a bigoted Yorkshire-
man. His passion for cricket and
other northern traits shine through,
maybe because the actor was born
and bred in Yorkshire? I have no
idea how true his character was to
his real personality, but his
performance was fantastic.
Made to sweat it out in a locked
room, the five detained immigrants
learn quickly to help each other out
and attempt to get on well. But
some characters just don't develop
a rapport and this results in a
handful of hilariously entertaining
bitching sessions. I am particularly
referring to a wealthy, successful,
Asian businessman and an
American airforce engineer, who
argue about just about everything.
Music, sport, politics, they cover
the lot.
The story runs parallel to a
Tibetan parable told by a Tibetan
detainee, which applies loosely to
the main storyline. This is a really
clever tactic by the writer because
it adds another dimension to the
play, enhancing the Tibetan feel to
it. It also enables bizarre interludes
that provide a break from the play,
which I feel are more of a theatrical
equivalent of space-filling than a
serious pause from the action.
Conclusion: Go see!

Worlds Apart
T h e Last Y a n k e e
This new play by Arthur Miller
currently receives its first British
airing at the Young Vic, directed by
David Thacker. Dealing, as ever,
with contemporary American life,
it is set in a state mental institution
and follows two different men, both
there to visit their wives who are
suffering from depression.
An immediate contrast exists
between Frick, a no bullshit, fast
buck American businessman and
the younger, Leroy Haviton.
Carpenter Leroy's 'You just have
to love this world' contentment with
his mediocre lot in life, bemuses the
successful Frick, since he also
knows that Leroy is descended from
one of the country's great
forefathers. His wife Patricia also
finds him frustrating with his
apparent lack of ambition, while
Karen, Frick's wife, finds solace in
her husband's ignorance of her.
The Last Yankee is a careful
study of the way in which feelings
of insufficiency and disappointment
have come to the fore of the minds
of these four different people, and
a distinguished cast of Peter
Davison (All Creatures etc, A
Peculiar Practice), Zoe Wanamaker
(Prime Suspect), Helen Burnsound
and David Healy, all performing at
their best in the intimacy of 'the
round', makes for an intense,
moving yet off-amusing production.
At an hour and twenty minutes
long, this play will not tax the bum,
but still leaves one uneasy in the
seat—Miller again manages to
portray incisively the feeling in
American society that the world has
not turned out to be quite what it
was first taken for.
