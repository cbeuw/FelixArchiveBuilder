Malaysian night ICSF-double
On the February 6th, the Malaysian
Society will present Malaysian
Nite, an evening dedicated to the
heritage that reflects the Malaysian
lifestyle, culture and cuisine. The
buffet, which proceeds the stage
performances will be prepared
professionally and shall consist of
mouth-watering dishes that only
Malaysian culinary skill can offer.
"These include Nasi Minyak,
literally meaning 'oiled' rice,
cooked over a base of onions, garlic
and selected spices; daging
rednang, a savoury dish of stir-fried
beef in a curried gravy of chillies,
spices and coconut milk; Nasi
Dilau, a yellow rice with origins in
Northern India, cooked with spices
and coconut; and Ay am masak
merah, meaning 'red fried chicken',
spiced and sauteed with a tomato-
based sauce. These dishes are just
some of the gastronomic variety of
delicacies that will be served and
everything is halal.
The stage performance later in
the evening will consist of sketches,
a contemporary dance and
traditional dance which stem from
the many diverse cultures of
Malaysia. Amongst these are
Tanian Lilin, the 'candle' dance
based on an old Sumatran tale
depicting the devotion of a maiden
towards her fiance as she searches
for her lost engagement ring in the
dark; the Ngajat, a warrior dance
of the tribal peoples of Sarawak; the
Lion Dance, which is a Chinese
display of acrobatic skill; the
Ribbon Dance, performed with
graceful movement. The
programme also includes a 'Silat'
demonstration, which is the
traditional Malay form of
self-defence.
To conclude, all I can say is for
you to forget the cold and the rain,
but come to support the show and
you shall find yourself transported
into the enchantment of the Far
East.
Wolves dancing
Winner of seven Oscars including
one for best picture, and, arguably
the best 'politically correct' movie
to come out of Hollywood, Dances
with Wolves is definitely a modern
classic.
Director, producer, and star
Kevin Costner had to put his
reputation on the line to get it made,
yet still managed to create a film
which elevated him to super-star
status.
Costner plays Lt John Dunbar,
who is given a choice of postings
by his superiors after an act of
heroism during the civil war. He
chooses a remote part of the
American mid-west so that he can
see more of his country while he
still has the chance.
But, Dunbar soon finds the
loneliness of the plains
overpowering until he befriends the
local Indians who have lived on the
land for centuries. This leads to a
tragic chain of events in which
Dunbar is forced to make an
extremely difficult decision.
As well as using real Red Indian
actors, the film really accentuates
the beauty and vastness of the mid-
west due to the super photography
and should not be missed.
So, here's your chance to see it,
because FilmSoc will show Dances
With Wolves at 7.30pm in Mech
Eng 220 on Thursday February
11th. Entry is £1.90 for non-
members and 90p for members and
remember that membership is now
only £3.50 with the first film free.

Orienteering
The Autumn Term was a very
successful one for the 'O'-club. In
the Greater London Orienteering
Championships ace runner Gary
Jefferson came 1st in the M19 class,
Ragnhild Balsvik 1st and Tone
Cecilie Nystrom 3rd in the W21
class.
In the Cambridge Sprinto Tone
Cecilie made it through to the finals
where she came third. Jake Badger
did a blistering run to come 9th
overall.
Other major events included the
Karrimor International Mountains
Marathon and the November
Classic National event. We finished
the term off with a training weekend
in frosty Sherwood Forest. Great
fun was had by all.
We have another action-packed
timetable for this term (including
some night orienteering) and shall
be competing in the British
Universities' Championships and
the international JK over Easter.
