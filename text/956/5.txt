Dom's election guide
It's that time of the year with Spring
fast approaching, that one starts to
think about life, New birth, cycles,
rhythm, existence, sprouty things
that come out of the ground and the
sabbatical elections. The sabbatical
elections, like the cadences of
nature, rise and fall but once a year
and are your chance as a member
of the Union to stand for a post, be
it President, Deputy President,
Hon. Sec. (Events) or Felix Editor.
This is your opportunity to fertilise
the seedlings of growth within your
Union, to water your ideas and
shine light upon your aspirations.
Or maybe you don't give a
monkey's and would much rather
be a chartered accountant.
If you are though a free thinking,
charismatic and handsome
individual (like this year's
sabbaticals) and are interested in
If this term was a goody bag and
events were sweeties then this
term's bag would be stuffed.
Already we've had the Ents
Carnival with Jamiroquai
(pronounced Jam-i-row-quai and
not Jammy rocky as those hip cats
in S(P)TOIC would have you
believe), the Guilds Carnival and
Rag Week is now almost finished.
Coming shortly are performances
from Chinese Society (tonight and
tomorrow), the Malaysian Society
Hibiscus evening (tomorow night),
International Night on Friday 5th
March and another long awaited
production from Dramsoc running
the week Monday 15th March. Plus
the usual weekly events happening
in the Union (check the What's On
column for details).
Another highlight this term is
Drink Your Way Round The World
Week which is running from
Monday 8th February through to
Valentine's Day in Da Vinci's in the
standing for a post then please come
and see me or indeed any of us who
will lie to your face and tell you
what a great job it is.
The papers go up on Monday 8th
February and come down on Friday
19th February. In between times all
you have to do is fill in the paper
(on the Union notice board opposite
the Union office) with the
signatures of 20 willing friends and
a proposer to become a fully
fledged running candidate. You
must also come and see me so that
I can explain the procedures of your
campaign and give you a copy of
the rules. Listed below are the dates
you need to know
You also need to book your
publicity NOW if you intend the
Print Unit to do this for you.
However no publicity material may
be used until papers come down.
Union. All you have to do is buy
the beer that is specially promoted
each night of the week. You will be
given a ticket in return which will
be entered into the draw for TWO
FREE RETURN FLIGHTS TO
PARIS. Other prizes also include a
colour TV and the draw will be held
on the evening of Valentines Day.
While on the subject of Union
events, if anyone lost a coat, jacket
or jumper last term then the chances
are it's sitting on the couch in my
office. Please come and reclaim
them before they become
swallowed by the rest of the junk
that inhabits my space.
Remember if you have any
comments on, or suggestions for,
Union events then please come and
see me. If you don't smoke or don't
have any tabs then don't bother.
Kick-off those sling-backs and
enjoy!
Dom.
Are you in for something new? In
two weeks time Ents present the
first World Music night to coincide
with International Week. For a taste
of dance with influences from
Africa to Ireland, Spain to India,
prepare yourselves for a night of
reggae, kwela, latin, tribal
sounds...finely balanced with
ambient techno. The coming event
will be brought to you by a well
respected DJ and an established
In the last few days we have seen
the beginning of what, I hope, will
be the most open ended review of
our Students' Union that has taken
place in its history. It is standard
thinking that the planning of change
should involve as many different
people/aspects of an organisation as
possible and that it is useful to have
a small team to bring the ideas
together. This we have set up and
consultation with Y O U will be
taking place over the next few
weeks.
As a result of all the questions we
will ask, we hope to gain an idea
of what the Union should be doing
for its membership. If we find that
it does this as well as is possible,
then we can sit back and watch it
happen (This is about as likely as

and backgrounds, a perfect

of my time in office). We will
certainly find some, probably
many, failings in our organisation.
With these we can find a most
desirable structure to provide these
services and submit a set of
proposals to achieve this. We intend
to report to the Union Council
either just before or just after
Easter.
Finally the first meeting of our
group was a training event and the
chap who did the training brought
one thing in particular home to me,
that apathy is an excuse used by a
naff President, not a problem with
the students. With this in mind we
will make it work but we do need
and value your input and support.
