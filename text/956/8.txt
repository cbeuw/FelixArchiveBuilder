With almost £2 billion being expended on the Jubilee Line extension, Lise
Yates considers the line's history.
The Jubilee Line: Stanmore to
Charing Cross, opened by Prince
Charles, 30 April 1979, and to the
public the following day. First
years: some history!
That is, of course, not quite all.
Prior to that date, stations on the
line had been served by
underground trains for over 100
years. The original Metropolitan
Line stations between Baker Street
and Wembley Park were opened to
(steam) trains on dates between
1868 and 1909, and then between
1913 and 1915 the tracks were
duplicated between Finchley Road
and Wembley Park providing two
tracks in both directions. From
1909, the stations now served by
Jubilee Line trains were served by
Metropolitan trains between
Wembley Park and Finchley Road.

i f,
was extended again, to Stanmore,
the northern terminus of the Jubilee
Line today, and on its way, created
a whole new suburb: Queensbury
gets its name from the station,
coined as a partner to Kingsbury.
The Metropolitan Line was now
severely congested between
Finchley Road and Baker Street,
where trains to and from six stations
terminated as far afield as to within
ten miles of Oxford. To alleviate
this bottleneck, twin tunnels were
excavated between Finchley Road,
through new stations at Swiss
Cottage, and St John's Wood, to
Baker Street. There were
previously three stations between
Finchley Road and Baker Street,
remnants of which can still be seen
today—indeed, one of the station
buildings is used as a restaurant.
At Baker Street, the tunnels
connected to the Bakerloo Line
tracks, and the service to Stanmore
was transfered to the Bakerloo Line
in 1939, and the Swiss Cottage and
St John's Wood stations opened and
are those used today.
In 1949, a report issued by
London Transport, which led
slowly but directly to the Victoria
Line mentioned another proposal,
for a line running northwest-
southeast across central London and
into South East London. This
resurfaced in 1962, in a definite
proposal for a line running under
Fleet Street, to Lewisham, via
Ludgate Circus, Fenchurch Street,
Surrey Quays and New Cross using
part of the East London Line, with
a possible later extension to
Thamesmead.
In 1969, Royal Assent (which is
needed to build any tube line) was
granted by the government in 1969,
for the first stage, running from
Baker Street, via Bond Street,
Green Park and Charing Cross to
Aldwych. In 1970, the Greater
London Council ( G L C , RIP),
agreed to meet 25 % of the cost, and
in 1971 the Government agreed to
pay the remaining 75 %, and work
began near Bond Street in late 1971.
During the year of the Queen's
Silver Jubilee, in 1977, the G L C
decided to change the name and the
Jubilee Line was born. In 1979, the
station between Baker Street and
Charing Cross was opened to the
public. The tunnels extend to
Aldwych, but the last section is
unused. In June 1979, the
Government decided that cheaper
alternatives to the extension through
docklands should be considered,
resulting in the abandonment of
plans to extend the Jubilee, and the
construction of the Docklands Light
Railway.
