IC firsts in semis Badminton thru
IC football 1st team continued their
trek towards Motspur Park by
eliminating R F H in the quarter-
finals of the U L cup with a 3-2
score. The Division Two hospital
side theoretically had no chance
against the current leaders of the
Premier Division but a lot of credit
must go to them for putting up a
fight.
The match started with IC keen
to win, after having been knocked
out of the U A U cup second round'
by Exeter University on
Wednesday, and their determination
was rewarded in the first ten
minutes with a goal from J
Mottashed, IC's superiority was
apparent and all RFH could do was
sit back and try to limit the damage.
They achieved this, with the help of
the woodworks, as IC hit the post
three times with J Mottashed, R
Dixon and T Botzios and the half
ended 1-0.
The second half started in much
the same way with J Mottashed
hitting the post again, but finally
scoring his second goal, courtesy of
a brilliant through ball from the
centre-back R Bruce. But then, the
incredible happened. RFH in their
only two attacks of the game, from
two corners managed to equalise!
They then closed themselves in
defence hoping to hold out until the
penalty shoot out. IC attacked
viciously, hit the post for the
umpteenth time and only managed
to score in the last minute of the
game, T Botzio's lob hitting the
post (!!!) and J Mottashed getting
the rebound to put IC in the semis
and earn himself his second hat-
trick of the season, leaving A
Galloway, IC's other forward,
sulking for having temporarily lost
his leading goal-scorer title.

All three of Imperial College's
badminton team qualified for the
play-off round which was held last
week. The men's first were at home
to Essex University while the 2nds
were away to Surrey. The ladies
match was won by a walk-over and
the ladies moved one step closer to
the finals.
For the first time this year the
men's firsts put out a full team. As
a result we were too strong for out
opponents and blitzed them 8-1.
The same could not be said for the
2nd team though who were quarter
finalists last year. Only 2 of the
regular 6 players were present to
play and on the day an incomplete
team of 4 travelled to Guildford
with dim hopes and the knowledge
that 3 points had to be conceded.
This turned out to be an
overwhelming disadvantage and it
was with surprise that the team
managed to grab a consolation point
out of the available nine.
The next round of the tournament
will take place on 10th February so
those of you who have always
wondered how the game is played
please come and support us on that
day. The game starts at 2pm in the
Great Hall.
The badminton club has two club
night sessions a week, Mondays and
Fridays at 8pm normally in the
volleyball courts. Membership is Â£6
which is inclusive of shuttlecocks.
Dribblers around
The Dribblers started well on a
pitch that resembled a swamp
somewhere in deepest Africa.
Maybe the groundsman felt
disgruntled at the amount of mud
we'd took out of his pitch and that's
why he charged so much for the
sandwiches. We were soon one-nil
up as Juliette kicked a corker into
the top right hand corner. The
opposition soon levelled and at half-
time the score was a well earned
one-all. They apologised for not
having oranges and gave us a bottle
of water instead. Is the team always
that thirsty or had they been
drinking the night before? I hope
it's the latter we've a reputation to
uphold. Paula had some excellent
runs up the left and amazing cross
put us ahead again.
With twenty seven minutes to go
the opposition scored again. The
score was two-all when a lucky shot
was fumbled by their goalie putting
us ahead with-only thirteen minutes
to go. A long time to keep the
opposition back but the Dribblers
succeeded again.
It was an energetic match, we
only had ten players. A big thank
you goes to Alex who stepped in at
the last minute and to everybody
else that played.
Training is on Thursdays,
6.30pm, in the Volleyball court.
We're going to the Ferret and
Firkin on Friday 5th February
please come along it should be fun.
