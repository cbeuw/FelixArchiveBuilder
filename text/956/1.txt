Disco War IRA targets South Kensington
Investigations Unit
Imperial College Union Ents may i l l l B
The Investigations Unit
understands that Lorna Mountford,
Rag Secretary, tried to make a disco
booking with Ents earlier this week,
and that the booking was refused by
the Ents Chairman because the
necessary disco equipment would
not be available tonight. This
equipment, which is Union
property, has been hired out for a
private function to be held tonight.
Miss Mountford and other Rag
officials have refused to comment
to Felix on the booking, but
witnesses have told Felix of a
telephone conversation between
Miss Mountford and Mandy
Hurford, Union General Manager.
Miss Mountford told Ms Hurford
that she was 'pissed off about the
disco booking being refused, and
asked for Ms Hurford's assistance
in resolving the problem. Miss
Mountford was also reported to be
displeased with members of
Imperial College Union Dramatic
Society (DramSoc) who asked for
complimentary drink during this
week's 'RCS Beer Festival'. This
complimentary drink has been
given in past years to DramSoc
members helping with the Festival.
As a result of Miss Mountford's
conversation with Ms Hurford, a
meeting was held in the Union
Office, with Chris Davidson, Union
President, Rick Bilby, Union
Deputy President, Mandy Hurford
and Andy Kerr among those
present. This sometimes heated

The I R A are targeting the
Kensington and Chelsea area it was
claimed on Wednesday by a
member of London Regional
Transport Police after a bomb
explosion at South Kensington tube
station.
The IRA have stepped up their
campaign of bombing recendy with
an attack on Harrods last week
which injured three people. Fears
of an increase in terrorist activity
in the South Kensington area have
increased with the approach of
Mountbatten Memorial Festival in
the Royal Albert Hall next week.
The Metropolitan police would not
confirm or deny the rumour, saying
only that it was against police policy
to comment on intelligence
operations.
Wednesday's bomb was planted
in a disused life shaft between the
Piccadilly line and the District line
platforms, and went off at 3.29pm,
showering the westbound Piccadilly
line platform with debris. Police
received two warnings from a male
with an Irish accent using a
recognised code-word. The
warnings were made twenty
minutes before the bomb went off.
meeting decided that Imperial
College Radio would be asked to do
the disco for the 'Great Rag Bash'
in the Ents lounge, using both IC
Radio equipment, and remaining
Ents equipment, including lights
and smoke machine. IC Radio
would provide records, turntables
and a mixing desk for the disco.
Following this meeting, Rick
Bilby made several attempts to
contact IC Radio about holding the
disco. Discussions were later held
between M r Bilby and David
Cohen, IC Radio Station Manager,
with M r Cohen agreeing to IC
Radio running the disco for Rag. It
was also agreed by M r Cohen, at
the suggestion of M r Bilby, to
waive the normal fee of £100. A l l
monies collected tonight will now
go to Rag.
The Investigations Unit
understands that, as an indirect
consequence of the £100 fee being
waived, IC Radio will now receive
'preferential' treatment should the
Union need to hold discos in future.
This includes discos for clubs and
societies, and a private function
already booked in the name of
Angus Fraser. The arrangement
may also include some discos to be
held on Wednesday and Friday
nights. M r Bilby was able to
confirm that an arrangement had
been reached with IC Radio, but
denied offering the chance to do
Ents traditional discos on
Wednesday and Friday.
The 'Great Rag Bash' will be
held in the Union Building tonight
at 8.00pm.
