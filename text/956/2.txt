Easter lease

Students wishing to spend extra
time in halls of residence over the
Easter vacation should contact the
Accommodation Office. Miss
Nicky Fox, Union Housing Officer,
told Felix that if there were any
students who were still not happy
with the lease they hold, they should
get in touch with the
Accommodation Office to see if
they can change it. She went on to
say that if students wanted to either
leave there rooms late, or come
back early, to study for exams for
example, they should also go to the
Accommodation Office and explain
why they needed their rooms for the
extra time. Any student staying in
halls over the vacation will be
charged normal rent, not
This year's sabbatical elections will
begin on Monday 8 February, when
papers will go up for the nomination
of candidates. A range of posts will
be open for election, comprising
President, Deputy President,
'commercial' rate as was suggested
by the Accommodation Office last
year.
Speaking to Felix, John Hassard,
Warden of Selkirk and Tizard Halls
of Residence, said that he
understood the importance of
maximising income from the
accommodation, but that the
students shouldn't be
inconvenienced. Dr Hassard went
on to say that more rooms should
be available for storage of students'
belongings over the vacation, and
he couldn't see why only three or
four rooms should be provided, as
was the case last year, when
maximum occupancy of the halls
over the Easter period was only
60%.

The student grant is worth only
40% of its 1980 value in terms of
average earnings, according to
figures released by the Central
Statistics Office. Social Trends
1993 also shows that polytechnic
graduates are twice as likely to be
unemployed as university
graduates, and that the number of
graduates training to be teachers has
increased by two thirds.
Education Department figures
show that while the number of
medicine and dentistry graduates
fell by 100 in the year to 1990/1,

Each candidate must be proposed
by a full member of Imperial
College Union, and seconded by
twenty others. Nominations will
close when papers come down on
Friday 19 February. After this date,
campaigning for all posts may
begin. Hustings, where candidates
can be questioned, will take place
in the Students' Union at St. Mary's
Hospital Medical School on
Monday 2 March. South
Kensington hustings will take place
on 4 March.
Although no candidates have yet
to formally declare that they are
standing for election, speculation
about possible candidates is rife,
with most speculation centring on
the post of president. Rachel
Mountford, Rag Chair, is expected
to put up a strong challenge, as
Mark Swan, St. Mary's Students'
Union President, may propose her.
Ms Mountford's main rival is
expected to be Marc Ellis, last
year's Rag Chair. M r Ellis,
commonly known as Penguin, may
also be proposed by a influential
member of St. Mary's Students'
Union. The St. Mary's vote, which
has proved significant in electing
Imperial College Union sabbaticals
in past years, now seems uniquely
open to the possibility of a split.
Another possibility for President
is Andrew Wensley, who would not
directly confirm the suggestions,
but instead suggested that he might
stand for Felix Editor and Print Unit
Rowing Champion, will be
presenting prizes, and guest
appearances may be made by Andy
Ripley (ex- England Rugby
International) and Matthew Pinsent,
Olympic Gold Medallist. Students
interested in entering a team in the
competition should get into teams
of four and turn up on the day.
the number of biological science
graduates rose by 1,900 with the
number of physical science
graduates rising by 2,700. The
number of engineering and
technology graduates, and
mathematical and computing
graduates both increased by 4,100.
The numbers of full time
undergraduates has increased by
over 8% in the year to 1990/1, with
the proportion of female students in
all full time degree courses
increasing by almost 10% during
the last ten years.
Manager.
The election for Deputy President
is forecast to be the least contested
post this year. David Goddard, ex-
Broadsheet Editor is said to be
interested in the post, damping
speculation that he would stand for
Felix Editor and Print Unit
Manager. To some muffled
expressions of surprise, Phillip
Henry, ex Phoenix Editor, is
actively searching a proposer for the
position of Deputy President. At the
time of going to press, Mr Henry
had yet to secure a proposer.
Charlie Leary, Chairman of Jazz
and Rock Club, has been mentioned
as a candidate for Hon Sec (Ents).
An Ents candidate may also be put
forward this year, as Dominic
Wilkinson, this year's Hon Sec
(Ents), was involved with Ents last
year. This year's Ents Chair is
Andy Kerr.
Rebecca Land has been interested
in the position of Felix Editor and
Print Unit Manager since last
summer, and was expected to have
an uncontested election until Ian
Davis announced his intention to
stand for the post. A n amicable
contest, though deemed unlikely by
some, has not been ruled out.
Other contenders will
undoubtedly appear before papers
come down and nominations close
on Friday 19 February. Candidates
will expose themselves throughout
Imperial College for the next four
weeks until the contests are resolved
on the evening of Tuesday 9 March.
