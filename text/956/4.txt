Kill the Queen
Dear Jonty,
'So monarchy would be a way to
'keep our identity"
What identity? The British Queen
is also a registered trophy for
several huge countries. Does she
help Canada retain its identity in the
face of the North-American Free
Trade system.
How many kangaroo-curious
tourtists know she 'rules' Australia?
Britain does not need a Queen or
King today to possess an identity.
History is by far enough to ensure
international recognition for
centuries...
Britain's colonial empire was one
of the largest ever, and also close
to the fastest in crumbling. When
the British left their invaded lands,
they always left enough chaos
behind to require centuries of
fixing. Let's see, where were the
Brits? After World War JJ, they had
a mission to lead a few countries
towards 'independence'—yep, a
few middle-eastern ones too.
Admirable massacres and wars
broke out in India and Palestine, a
few days after the British left.
Result: several new countries hating
one-another's guts. Look around for
others....
Say, they were also in South-
Africa, where they invented
something damn intelligent-
concentration camps. And of
course, they were satisfied with
apartheid. History for Identity....
Felix 956
Maybe our vision of recent years
is not yet very clear—we may still
not understand the recent war with
Argentina. OK—remember a
hundred years of war with France?
Being chucked out of America after
killing hundreds of thousands of
Red Indians.
But we can see a few things
clearly. We know who slows most
European debates after having
insisted three times on joining the
EEC (with unfortunate success the
third)—Yep, the same guys who
maintained a lyingly high currency
whilst only 2% of their twenty year-
olds reached A-levels and their
heavy industry vanished into deadly
deficits.
Sure, lots of other nations with
monarchies were bastardly as well,
and too proud to admit they have
lost power, dignity and stability.
(Though the case here is surely one
of the worst—by the way, sorry to
any Brits who hold the English
entirely responsible—I won't enter
this debate).
So come on—try to rebuild
prestige for Britain through positive
aspects. You've got the arts,
technology—hell, even brains!
Forget this senseless monarchy
which comforts stuck-up stuttering
sherry-drinking aristocrats, middle-
aged whisky-drinking middle-brow
middle-class, and beer-drinking
bogroll-newspaper readers.
Crocky.
Waffling on
Dear Jonty,
There has been a lot of blurb and
waffle lately in Felix, mainly
written by one opinionated
arsehole. With the relaxed
atmosphere that is University life I
find it sad to think that some people
are trying to force their opinions
down the throats of others. I'm not
saying that to have an opinion is
wrong, if anything this is perfectly
Kong strikes back
reasonable, provided they are
themselves reasonable.
According to a know all, the start
of the road to hypertension and
heart attacks at 40 is reading Cat's
Eyes on a Friday morning. So your
chosen reading depends on the
opinions of an over opinionated
biologist—big deal.

Dear Jonty,
Thank you to all those who have
taken the time and the guts to beat
a path to Felix's hallowed portals
and face the resident King Kong
(myself) r.e. doing some reviewing,
I know how scary I can be....Let
us hope the pages of our revered
organ begin to bust with copious
quantities of wit and esplagere. I
must, however add (yo, Carol) that
Shameless plug
if you think I'm shoving Bolshoi
Ballet tickets in your direction via
a pigeonhole, sorry no can do. I
know I have hairy palms and eat
broken glass for breakfast but, you
want to review, you keep coming
into the office, simple? See you
soon (grrr ).
Love,
Sara, Theatre Editor.
Dear Editor,
The Overseas Students
Committee of IC is proud to
announce yet another International
Night.
This year, besides the highly
popular multi-cultural show (a
chance to see your friends making
complete fools out of themselves)
and the usual disco there will also
be a ten piece Latin American band.
Much to the relief of the committee,
the food fair will be able to make
a come back (yummy, yummy) this
year.
International Night '93 will fall
on the 5th March. It's an event not
to be missed if you will like to have
the experience of a lifetime. Last
but not least, we will like to
encourage anybody out there who
is remotely interested in helping out
or participating to come forward. In
the mean time, stay cool and we'll
get back to you soon.
With much love,
Overseas Student Committee.
