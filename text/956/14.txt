N e w Statesman and Society
My, my, Last week was good for
gossip, leading to the rare event of
a serving Prime Minister issuing
libel writs. The first to do so since
Wilson, who was a paranoic
maniac, thinking MI5 was
destabilising his government. Twit.
He was Labour as well, which is a
rare enough commodity.
I digress. I have to. Given the
libel laws, I can't tell you much
about the content of the two articles,
little hypocrite that Major is. What
a wonderful free press we have in
this incredibly democratic (sic)
country. What about his pledge for
more open, or was that (sotto voce)
less secret, government? Git. Bet he
liked Pravda. (No, Clive. Go
away.)
Mind you, a good way for New
Statesman and Society (NSS) to
promote their relaunch, that.
Getting on every news bulletin by
getting all your copies removed
from the shelves of every
newsagent in the country. Apart
from mine, that is, but don't come
looking for an address, as they were
off the shelves before I left the shop.
The NSS cover is a bit
provocative. 'The curious case of
John Major's 'mistress',' it reads.
Who is that woman behind Major,
with a tray of food? 'It is the story
that dare not speak its name,' says
NSS editor, Steve Piatt, promising
to investigate the 'rumour, gossip
and nudge- and-a-wink innuendo'
behind the story the whole of
Whitehall and Westminster has
already speculated about. Didn't
think he was up to it, personally,
eating exotic food in the small
hours. He's more of a Happy Eater
man
It's a pity the mag (rhyming
slang?) was withdrawn from sale,
because there are some storming
articles in the rest of it, including
what is probably a new Labour
policy change, this time on crime.
There's also a nice bit about
unauthorised road repairs in
Lambeth, incidentally John Major's
old stomping ground. I also spy a
new Science and Environment
section, an inclusion to be
commended anywhere. Press
freedom, that old Western lie, is
tackled comprehensively and
challengingly by John Pilger.
Things should be back to normal
for NSS today, as far as normal can
Felix 956
be for an intelligent magazine about
to be bludgeoned to death by an
illiterate who just scraped an
O'level in English. By way of a
footnote, NSS concluded that the
rumours were untrue, and slapped
the wrists of those who spread
them. I hope the case does come to
court, so that we can see Major in
the witness box, being cross
examined by a real barrister with
guts, and not that halfwit who does
it every Tuesday and Thursday.
Their defence fund can be contacted
at Foundation House, Perseverance
Works, 38 Kingsland Road, E2
8DQ, or on 071 739 3211. Happy
birthday, NSS.

S u c k e r s by A n n e Billson
Set in 1980s London with yuppie
culture being the background to this
toothy novel. When the Multiglom
Organisation take over the City the
death toll of victims is soaring as
fast as their share prices. Their chief
executive, a three hundred year old
vampire, has re-formed having been
hacked into little pieces in the 1970s
by our heroine Dora.

Ann Billson the author must have
had her tongue firmly pressed into
her cheek during the writing of this
novel and she creates in Dora, a
thoroughly bitchy and manipulative
character to follow through this
book. There were several bits in the
book which I found amusing and to
my mind made Dora a more
endearing figure. For instance a
hate-mail campaign against a
woman who gazumped her when
she decided to buy a flat.
This book is full of all the old
vampire cliches such as eating
tonnes of garlic to ward off evil
spirits, stakes through hearts etc. At
one stage, in an effort to distract the
enemy, Dora foregoes her usual
chic wardrobe and covers herself in
a mass of crucifix jewellery and
carries a rosary.
The vampire theme for this book
was unnecessary and the author
could have had an effective dig at
yuppies without trying to jump on
the band-wagon. I found some of
the observations in this book
vaguely reminiscent of Martin
Amis's London Fields and I hope
in future work the author doesn't
feel the need to use a cheap
gimmick to make her point.
