The Wise Wound: Somebody stole my ambulance, Mummy.
Life Indie Clubs
Lise Yates details to one and all how
exactly she spends her time, sleeps
with a DJ, and gives an advance
course in degree failing.

OK, so its upstairs in a pub. But it's
a reasonably packed upstairs in a
pub, and the lighting is
'interesting'. Poets and hippies and
psychedelia and peculiar lighting, in
a fairly constant flow of artists,
through the night. The highlight of
the night in question, wherein were
the psychedelically acoustic Wise
Wound, six people who sing about
some things and are very pleasant,
and travel round in an ambulance
called 'Lance'. But, and anyhow,
that's it. It's an acoustic selection,
and it's well worth a visit or two.

• The Cock Tavern, Phoenix Rd,
NW1 (King's Cross tube), until
Sunday. Particularly recommended,
Praying for the Rain, on Saturday.
£2.
So there I was, time on my hands
and boots on my feet, and I said to
myself, 'let's club, baby!'
Unfortunately, it were Monday in
the wild West Six, so I was forced
to use the powers invested in me,
of poet's license, and hippy's
incense to advance to Tuesday.
Tuesday for the avowed indie kid
has only ever meant one thing, and
it's Feet First, and the occasional
half decent live band showing up
around half twelve allow for a short
respite from all that stamping
around. But then you all know that,
don't you. No self respect, that's
the problem with the yoyuth of
today. You'll never get the chance
again, when (if) you graduate, it's
all nine to six, work, work, work.
Wednesday, and so very soon,
doth appear the point of this article.
Yes, after much sleeping with DJs,
and their immediate and distant
relatives, we have secured for you
the lovely offer detailed below. The
chance to go clubbing and maiming
in Leicester Square for a pound,
from 10 until God knows what hour
in the morning. The club in
question, Automatic at the Gass
club, Whitcomb Street (The road
besides McDonald's).
Thursday, and after the demise of
the legendary Syndrome club, it's
time to look for somewhere new.
Hazzard County at the Underworld
looks like being a major sleaze
scene for glamsters, and Rockit at
the Borderline is cheap enough if
you get there before midnight (£1).
The Syndrome people are rumoured
to be resurfacing with an indie club
with a dress code, so we can only
hope.
Friday. Gigantic, at the Marquee
is always a good bet, if you can
squeeze yourself in. For those with
an eye to the suburbs, South of the
river at the Venue, Face The
Music/Inferno can be good if you
like the band.
Saturday, and the Venue's open
again, with a pretty similar set-up,
but for thoseof you who won't go
South of the river for fear of all the
bridges collapsing before you
return, there's always the old
stalwarts of Loony Toons (The
Dome, Tufnell Park) and Silver
(Underworld) to stick to. And on
the last Saturday of the month, if
you get there early enough, there's
the Psychedelic Quintessence club
at 20 Castlehaven Road, Camden.
Special Offer
7 Year B i t c h — P o w e r h a u s
This band has such titles in its
repertoire as 'Dead Men Don't
Rape' and 'No Fuckin' War',
which has the immortal line "Bush
pull out like your father should
have.'' This should give you an idea
of where these four ladies (sic) are
coming from, for yes, this is
another example of (whisper it) an
all-girl band. The gig, in a word,
was astonishing. For a start there
was a group of girls down the front
beating up any man encroaching on
their mosh-space. It was like
nothing I've seen before, and it
made a refreshing change from the
usual scene of lots of boozed-up
blokes argy-bargying about (for
want of a better phrase) getting on
everybody's nerves. The music was
ace, too, considering they were a bit
nervy, this being there first EVER
gig in the UK, and also considering
that the new guitarist (the old one
having just OD'd - all my favourite
bands have drug-deaths, it seems)
didn't appear to know what she was
doing for the first half of the gig!
Support slots came from Die
Cheerleader and" Death By
Crimpers, but I can't find anything
to write about them, so I shall leave
it there.

Cut this out and go clubbing with it.
