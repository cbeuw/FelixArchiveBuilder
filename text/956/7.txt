The ICU Five-a-Side Soccer Tournament will soon open, below
are the rules
The Imperial College Indoor Soccer
Tournament is open to any team
representing a club or society of the
Imperial College Union. Each team
has a maximum of six players, with
the club or society able to enter a
maximum of two teams each.
Since the tournament shall lake
place ill the Volleyball Court,
within the grounds of Imperial
College, the size of the playing area
means that all matches shall be
contested between sides of four
players each. This allows the 2
extra players per team to act as
substitutes, relieving on-field
players for tactical reasons. A l l
matches shall be played over two
periods, with each period lasting 15
minutes, and with every game being
supervised by a referee.
There are expected to be
approximately 16 teams entering the
tournament. Hence it was decided
that the first half of the tournament
should involve a group stage. This
would be done by splitting the teams
into four groups, with each group
encompassing four teams. Within
each group each team will play each
other team once, and points shall be
awarded depending upon the
outcome of each match; 3 points
will be awarded for a win, 1 point
for a draw, and no points for a loss.
The top two teams from each group
will qualify to enter a second phase
of the tournament, which will be a
knock-out stage. The factors which
decide which teams qualify for the
second phase are: the number of
points attained, goal difference,
goals scored and goals conceded. If
two teams cannot be distinguished
