Pretentions generally surface early
on in the big wide world which is
the 'music scene'. Everyone's after
the 15 minutes they need to catch
the heart strings of an audience
which could take them to greater
things. Wearing a baby's dummy as
a ring falls straight into the
pretension trap (please note, Sloan's
Chris Murphy). It shouts 'look
we're really wacky', a certain death
wish in anyone's diary.
Or so I thought during the first
couple of rotations of Sloan's
'Smeared' album; a band trying too
hard to impress in an already
crowded market. But we all have to
be humble. Yes, I admit, I was
hasty, pleading on grounds of
diminished liability. 'Smeared' is
one of those dying breeds which
grows on your brain, slowly oozing
into the deepest cracks.
The two upstanding tracks are T
am the Cancer' and the rakish 'Take
It In' which crackle along, pressing
all the right buttons. Which is
certainly not to say there are no
dead ends; the second side
certainmly tails off into an oblivious
heap. Overall though there's
enough going on to accumulate a
net surplus. Fuzzy guitars and some
sharpish lyrics mesh quite
excellently, thank you very much,
and the tendency to quirkiness just
takes the edge off any lurking self-
importance (dummies not excused).

(So G r o o v y Now)
It was on the 'Mo'money'
sountrack. It's boring. Haven't I got
a tutorial to go to?
l o n i — S e n t e n c e of Love
It's boring, but she was a Pirelli
Calender model before starting her
singing career. 'Nuff said.
Stick to the Calenders love.

There's not much I could say about
this single. So I won'f bother. Get
Out of M y Record Collection.
Well, I sense that you don't actually
believe I listened to these fridolin
kisa (that's Norwegian for records,
actually it isn't, but I digress). Lies,
I did listen to them once.

If you've heard of Terrorvision
you'll probably ignore anything I
say; if you haven't heard of them
you're not missing out. I suppose
we need them to remind us what
good music, even good rock,
sounds like but that's about the only
reason I can imagine for this
release. I dread to think what the
problem was.

A note was handed over to the
singer, it read 'What about the
huggy nation? Why be original
when Robert Smith will do?' Quite!
say us, why indeed? For this was
nothing but pastiche, a bland
version of the pulp independent
scene. Elements of every band that
I dislike are obvious, but nothing
comes to the surface. With all
things considered, this was nothing
more than an impersonation of a
more mature band, however, this
band would have songs to go with
the attitude. Ability to go with the
haircuts and talent to go with the
Doc Martens.
Admittedly, I had seen them
before and remembered them in a
more positive frame of mind, but
for God's sake the huge steaming
pile of excrement presented to me
this evening was definitely not
worth the £3.50.
Fundamentally avoidable.
I hope they weren't paid.
