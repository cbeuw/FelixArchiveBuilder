FILM
FELIX Friday 04 MAY 2012 25
In brief: what we watched over Easter
21 Jump Street
American teen comedy isn’t
dead after all. Two rookie cops
(Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill) are
assigned an undercover mis-
sion in a high-school to track
down the supplier of a deadly
new drug. Hilarity ensues as the
two thirty-something year-olds
try to fit in whilst realising that
the high-school they left behind
years ago isn’t quite the same
anymore. The shockingly bril-
liant Johnny Depp cameo is a
huge plus.
The Hunger Games
A thought-provoking, futuristic
thriller that is superbly acted
especially from the young
members of its cast (Jennifer
Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson),
as two of 24 teenagers forced
to fight to their deaths until
there is one victor, whilst the
whole world watches them
for amusement. The powerful
social commentary makes for
an interesting watch, but just
don’t expect a bloody Ameri-
can Battle Royale.
Gone
The only thing worse than
the wide-eyed and otherwise
blank Amanda Seyfried going
on a mad rampage to find her
past kidnapper who has now
abducted her sister, is that
this thinly drawn psychologi-
cal thriller makes very little
sense. Add to that there is ac-
tually no moment of genuine
tension due to so many ab-
surd plot developments and
silly characters. Most definite-
ly one to avoid and ignore.
Act of Valour
A shamelessly patriotic film
made by Americans, for Amer-
icans: real U.S. SEALs were
used for this, which more
than explains the stilted act-
ing. Holding them back more
is the paper-thin script that
gives us no insight into any of
its characters, and so even its
attempt at tear-jerking drama
never quite works. The com-
bat scenes however, are unde-
niably impressive. Think of it
as a fancy recruitment piece.
The Raven
When a deranged psycho-
path decides to reenact all
the grizzly murders written in
Edgar Allan Poe’s gothic hor-
ror stories, it is up to the au-
thor himself (an eccentric yet
oddly brilliant John Cusack)
to outsmart this obsessed-
fan-turned-serial-killer. Part
torture horror, part detective
thriller, part period drama, it’s
an entertaining enough, yet
not-at-all deep, exploration of
the much-celebrated novelist.
In Darkness
Last year’s Oscar Best For-
eign Language Film nominee,
this extraordinary true story of
an initially greedy city plumb-
er (Robert Wieckiewicz, on
top form) hiding a dozen or
so Jews in the complicated
underground sewers during
World War II, is both a haunt-
ing and deeply touching tale.
It’s long, with its fair share of
heavily dramatised moments,
but the final emotional payoff
is well worth waiting for.
Battleship
Five far superior and techno-
logically advanced alien ships
land on Earth after nosy sci-
entists thought it would be
a good idea to bother them
on their own planet. Now the
fate humanity rests on three
human navy ships as they go
head-to-head. Sounds ridicu-
lous and, for the most part, it
is, but the carefully crafted ac-
tion scenes are so entertain-
ing that you might not even
notice the film’s many holes.
This Must Be the Place
Playing a retired rock star
who goes on a journey of self-
discovery following the death
of his father, the usually in-
tense and fiery Sean Penn’s
incredibly soft-spoken, gentle
performance is the absolute
highlight of this otherwise
slightly chaotic and messy
road-trip movie in which the
long-lost son seeks out the
man who humiliated his re-
cently passed father during
World War Two.
John Carter
This box-office failure will cost
Disney around 200 million dol-
lars but financial loss doesn’t
necessarily mean bad film.
Burdened with an unappeal-
ing title, an unknown hero and
giant insect aliens, there is no
way this could have marketed
well enough to pull in the big
crowd. But Disney’s latest at-
tempt at the superhero genre
remains an entertaining spec-
tacle, full of colourful images
and breath-taking action.
Bel Ami
R-Patz decides to stick his
schlong where it doesn’t be-
long, sleeping his way through
the richest, most powerful mar-
ried women in 1880s Paris,
France. The three ladies who
fall for his looks (Uma Thurman,
Kristin Scott Thomas, Christina
Ricci) fare better than Pattin-
son’s rather one-dimensional
performance, but the film’s
sensual ambiance almost
makes up for the leading man’s
lack of magnetic charisma.
We Bought a Zoo
Matt Damon is a widower who
doesn’t have a clue on how to
raise his two kids. Wanting a
fresh start, he buys a house
that comes with a zoo, to reno-
vate and reopen it for busi-
ness. Difficulties lie ahead,
including his angry son, money
problems, pedantic zoo inspec-
tors, and escaping animals. It
does take forever to get to its
predictable happy ending, but
Damon’s likable performance
keeps everything together.
Mirror Mirror
The tacky marketing doesn’t
do this film justice. It may not
be a radical reimagination of
the classic tale but with direc-
tor Tarsem Singh’s focus on
dazzling visuals and stunning
costumes, the first “Snow
White” adaptation of 2012, is
worth checking out. Julia Rob-
erts is at her hilarious best
as the evil queen, Lily Collins
is innocently beautiful, and
Armie Hammer is effortlessly
charming as the prince.
Contraband
Although retired from his life
of illegal smuggling, family
man Chris (Mark Wahlberg)
is forced back into pulling
one last job for his screw-up
brother-in-law who ends up
owing money to dangerous
men. There are moments of
genuine tension, but it’s more
of a rehash of the same thing.
Wahlberg doesn’t disappoint
in an easy role, and he’s sup-
ported by the suitably insane
Giovanni Ribisi as the villain.
Wrath of the Titans
This time, unlike its predeces-
sor, there are actual Titans, but
everything else is a mess. The
plot and character develop-
ments don’t make any sense,
and despite the loud action
sequences, the film doesn’t
know what to do with Perseus
(Sam Worthington). Once
again tasked with saving the
world from evil Greek Gods, he
embarks on a dull quest with
absolutely useless “warriors”
(e.g. Rosamund Pike).
Salmon Fishing in the
Yemen
Two of the most likable ac-
tors from Britain (Emily Blunt,
Ewan McGregor) form a sweet
and charming duo in this sug-
ary sweet rom-com. What they
get up to is dead predictable
from its uninspired title, but
Lasse Hallestrom’s latest is
a highly enjoyable blend of
drama and comedy, the latter
thanks to the priceless Kristin
Scott Thomas.
