Elections’ were announced over a
staggered period this year . The elec-
tions, which saw a record turnout of

nical issue that and disagreements
between candidates over campaigning
that ultimately led to a delay of the
declaration of results.

and as previously reported, the on-
line voting system failed to display

Jack Hewitt’s manifesto on the “in-

Matt Colvin Elections Committee originally ruled
that all affected votes be struck, this
decision was appealed and taken to
Union Court, where the decision was
quashed and declared unconstitution-
al.
The Presidential campaign was also
affected by delays as individual can-
didates brought forward complaints
against tactics used during the cam-
paign.
The results for Deputy President
(Welfare) and President were delayed
until 22 March and 27 March respec-
tively rather than the 20 March for the
other positions.
