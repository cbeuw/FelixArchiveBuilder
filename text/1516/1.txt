Imperial has dropped nine places from
last year in the Times Higher Education
(THE) Student Experience Survey to
take joint 71st place with Canterbury
Christ Church University. The Univer-
sity of Dundee topped the survey with
a score of 85% while Imperial scored
73.4%, slightly lower than the average
of 75.1%.
Imperial scored in the lowest quartile
of universities in the categories ‘help-
ful/interested staff’, ‘good social life’,
‘good community atmosphere’, ‘per-
sonal requirements catered for’, ‘good
personal relationships with teaching
staff’, and ‘tuition in small groups’.

score out of all universities for ‘fair
workload’ and a lower than average
score in the category ‘I would recom-
mend my university to a friend.’
However, Imperial scored highly in
the categories ‘good sports facilities’,
‘good library and opening hours’, ‘good
industry connections’ and ‘high quality
facilities’.
The survey gathered the views of
over 13,000 undergraduates from 105
UK universities who were recruited
through the Universities and Colleges
Admissions Service (UCAS). Students
were asked to rate 21 aspects of univer-
sity life on a seven-point scale. Each
aspect was then assigned a weighting
by examining the factors most closely
correlated with good scores in the cat-
egory ‘I would recommend my univer-
sity to a friend.’ The average number of
respondents from each university was
just 132.
Scott Heath, ICU President, said,
“What we have to remember is that

perceptions, expectations and opinions.

comparable data sets.’
He added that, “The union has been
