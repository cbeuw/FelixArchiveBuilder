I
n the recent elections one of the
Union’s main concerns was the
lack of postgraduate participa-
tion in the voting. However,
postgraduate representation at
Imperial is pretty poor and it is unsur-
prising that they were feeling a little
uninspired to vote. The focus should
have been on getting postgraduates to
run and thus improving representation
in the first place.
During the elections, I received an
email urging me as postgraduate to
vote. By this point I had already placed
my votes with regards to the Sabbati-
cal positions but had left the GSA ones
for another time. So after receiving the
email I decided that I might as well get
it over and done with and complete
the rest of my voting. However, to my
surprise, I discovered that out of all the
GSA positions available only one per-
son was running. ONE.
Well obviously the next step was
to air my opinion on the matter via
twitter:
“Just got an email urging me to vote
as a postgrad in the IC elections. Bit
difficult with no GSA candidates to
vote for #voteicu”
Following this, I received a rapid re-
ply from @icunion:
“The Sabbatical team represent all
students at Imperial, not just UGs. It
is essential that PGs vote in these elec-
tions! #voteicu”
Well that’s nice and everything but I
pointed out that with no PG reps run-
ning there was no choice but to rely on
the Sabbs for representation. Unfor-
tunately, the Imperial College Union
twitter account was not quite so quick
to reply this time (I’m still waiting in
fact). Furthermore, HOW do the Sab-
batical team represent postgrads. Apart
from the Postgrad Mingle and a few
emails from the Union President aimed
at postgrads, I’m unaware of any sort
Holes in postgraduate representation
of concrete representation. Why should
we have to rely on purely the Sabbs?
Although they would like to think oth-
erwise they come across as very under-
graduate focused and it feels as if the
union elections completely overshad-
owed the GSA ones.
Postgraduates have a different range
of problems, and candidates running in
the elections need to make it clear how
voting can improve things specifically
for postgraduates. It’s no good just
sending emails urging people to vote.
According to the email I received, I
have a departmental representative
who has been working really hard to
improve my student experience. I’m
really curious as to who this entity is
as I have never received an email from
them or even been informed who they
are and how I can contact them. But
apparently they have made a really big
difference. I’m sure it would have been
even bigger if they had actually con-
tacted the students they were supposed
to represent. I must point out that I am
a Masters student in the Humanities
department so this is based on my own
experience rather than those in other
departments or who are PhD students.
However, as a Masters student I feel
like I’ve fallen in to a big Imperial Col-
lege blindspot. I didn’t get to vote for
the GSA reps before I started and vot-
ing this year is a little irrelevant as I
won’t be around next year. Someone
informed me recently that they were
interested in running this year but were
not able to as they weren’t a postgradu-
ate until next year. Basically, everyone
who isn’t midway through their PhD
is excluded from going for a position.
The elections are rerun in September
but any new incoming students will
be so preoccupied with settling in they
won’t have much of a clue about it.
I’m lucky in that I did my undergrad
degree here and I was a student rep, I
know who to contact if problems do
arise but I’m sure that new incoming
PGs haven’t the foggiest. I expect no
major complaints are logged because
they don’t know who to complain to.
The GSA does provide the structure
to deal with unique PG problems but
what happens now when this structure
is clearly not effective and at the mo-
ment non-existent. The union’s knee-
jerk reaction to this appears to be im-
plementing a dedicated postgraduate
Sabb. I very much approve of this idea;
I just hope that the infrastructure will
be in place to support this person be-
cause otherwise they will be carrying a
lot of responsibility on their shoulders.
On a more personal note, another
characteristic of my MSc blindspot is
the fact I’ve been given this title of
postgraduate yet I’m not allowed to
use the SCR or the Holland Club. My
department is tiny and doesn’t provide
a space for me to work or relax; the
common room is reserved for PhD stu-
dents. I’m restricted to the Library and
other general areas, which is altogether
thoroughly uncomfortable at times es-
pecially now in the peak of exam sea-
son. A designated PG space that I, as
a Masters student, could use would be
much appreciated. And before anyone
brings it up, yes I have put this as part
of my feedback on the PG student sur-
vey. Suffice to say, it certainly hasn’t
done anything for my satisfaction in the
Imperial College student experience.
Elections are over now, but with only
one GSA position filled who knows
how successful the next round will be.
I’m sure the Union has a whole host of
reasons as to why this situation is as
it stands, but with student satisfaction
becoming one of its priorities I feel
that this is something that needs to be
addressed. When this is added to the
growing frustration of the postgraduate
population due to the threatened clo-
sure of the Holland Club and the dis-
posal of Clayponds, something has to
be done to show that postgraduates are
still a valued part of the student body.
Postgraduates have
a different range
of problems, and
candidates running
in the elections
need to make it
clear how voting
can improve things
specifically for
postgraduates

GSA elections were online, mainly because this is what the ballot paper
would have looked like. Grim
Cat got your tongue?
Wrote up some notes on Monday, took a
past paper on Tuesday, I was revising on
Wednesday, and on Thursday and Friday
and Saturday and then wrote for Comment
to complain about it on Sunday.
