T
he world of sport was
plunged into turmoil this
week when it emerged
that Britain’s descent into
a double-dip recession has
shaken the confidence of those working
on Felix Sport. “We deal in sport every
day and we know when it’s on shaky
ground. We don’t care if Roy Hodgson
is set to be England’s saviour, these are
dangerous times. Also we have exams.”
The news arrived as a severe blow to
the average man on the street: “This is
a severe blow,” said one individual who
wished to remain anonymous, primarily
because he’s my housemate and was the
only person I asked.
“You know, you go from the highs of
that Varsity Live Blog last term (felix-
online.co.uk/varsity/) to this. Ques-
tions really need to be asked. And then
answered. And then lessons need to be
learnt too.”
Recession hits Sport section

Another marquee discovered
Speculation is still rife over the com-
ing and going of the marquee on the
Queen’s Lawn, despite the fact that it
was revealed a while back that it was
the holding place of the 34th Interna-
tional Charing Cross Symposium dur-
ing the period of 14 – 17 April. De-
spite the onset of vascular specialists
on Imperial, some students have still
been floating around theories that even
L. Ron Hubbard would probably have
balked at.
“I’m pretty sure they excavated the
Ark of the Covenant,” said one fresher
following the event.
“Nah mate, it’s a sophisticated way of
keeping everyone from revising on the
grass,” a passer-by suggested.
A third party swiftly joined the im-
promptu debate, “Oh come on, it’s
clearly a giant professorial sweat
lodge.”
“”
I’m really excited
about the return of
those Credit Crunch
Lunches
a recession brings to the local food and
drink industry.
“I’m really excited about the return
of those Credit Crunch Lunches they do
around South Kensington. I don’t even
care if they cost the same as any other
meal usually does, they really capture
the zeitgeist of impending financial
doom.”
Can you help? Are you a sport fa-
natic mourning this week’s missing
sport section, but with the instinct,
tenacity, wit, charm, and copious
chutzpah to carry the torch for Felix
Sport for the next few weeks and
perhaps even beyond? Failing that,
what should we have here in place
of the usual Sport section? So many
questions, so little time. Get in touch
with us at felix@imperial.ac.uk.
Not everyone was apprehensive
about the ongoing financial situation,
however. One individual that Felix
found camped out on Level 4 of Cen-
tral Library assessed the positives that This easy to understand infographic explains everything
Who wants to revise outside anyway?
Tensions are clearly high, yet this is
not the end of the intrinsic relationship
between the Queen’s Lawn and mar-
quees. On Thursday construction was
spotted of a new marquee ahead of next
week’s Postgraduate Graduation Cere-
mony, to be held on Wednesday 9 May.
Plans to launch a ‘Marquee Watch’
campaign on this very page met a seri-
ous obstacle when it emerged than no-
one particularly cared enough.

“Hey, is that a new sweat lodge?” “No, it’s another marquee.”
