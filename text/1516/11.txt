describing depression in purely clini-
cal terms or elaborating on the actual
triggers for what made me depressed, I
wanted to draw attention to the impor-
tance of seeking support from the pro-
fessionals and loved ones, and that my
initiating these steps you demonstrate
bravery, intelligence and a strong de-
sire to love life once again.
and I felt myself getting very lonely
and increasingly solitary.
I looked for help at the beginning
of the Spring term in the form of the
Imperial counselling service and found
myself pouring my heart out for an
hour to someone willing to listen. But
outside that one hour a week I felt to-
tally lost.
It is not that none of my friends tried
to help. Most of the ones that noticed
the difference in me put it down to
exam stress and getting dumped by my
boyfriend. But what they didn’t know
was it was the way I was feeling that
had led both of those things coming to
a head. How could I pass my exams
when I couldn’t keep it together for
more than 5 minutes?
I remember breaking down af-
ter coming out of the shower, satt in
the corridor sobbing wearing a towel
while a concerned friend wondered
what to do. And being chaperoned to
and from a café by my friends on their
way to uni every day throughout study
leave.
At that point I was having very dark
thoughts which led me to stand with
my back to the wall of the platform
waiting for the tube every time I used
it. I was scared of what some part of me
might want to do. I never self-harmed
as such. I just remember digging my
nails into my arms whenever anything
got too much, without thinking, even
while just having a conversation. The
small amount of pain reminded me that
I was still there.
My department were very support-
ive. I saw a doctor, ignoring his insis-
tence that medication was necessary.
I finally told my mum what was hap-
pening to me. I got through my exams,
spent the summer recuperating and re-
turned in good spirits for second year,
only to find the same pattern of decline
throughout the year. This time, how-
ever, I had some support from friends
and family.
I am not better, but I have found
ways of coping. Loud music helps, as
does taking time away from work to do
things I want to do. I am hoping my fi-
nal year will pass with fewer hitches as
I really want to enjoy my time at Impe-
rial and remember it more positively.
I have met, in my time at univer-
sity, many people who believe that
mental illness is a weakness and it is
created solely by yourself. The only
way I have been able to talk about my
experiences, even with my friends, is
through a series of incredibly inap-
propriate jokes about me being ‘crazy’
which make everyone uncomfortable.
But isn’t it sad that is the only way
I can express how I am feeling? So
I would entreat you to listen to what
your friends are saying, you might not
understand but, at least for me, trying
is good enough. A inappropriate joke is
in fact a cry for help.

D
epression wasn’t some-
thing that happened to
me at university. It had
always been there real-
ly but at a manageable
level and I, as everyone leaving for
university, thought that I would escape
the problems of the past, move on and
have a fabulous time.
And for a while it worked. I met new
people, I didn’t do too badly, I had
enough stuff to keep me busy. But as
first year wore on, my energy ebbed
“It had always been
there really but at a
manageable level”
“I am not better, but
I have found ways of
coping”
