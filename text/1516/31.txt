It’s back with a vengeance.
The cells in a grid have to be coloured
or left blank according to numbers at
the side of the grid.
The numbers measure how many un-
broken lines of filled-in squares there
are in any given row or column. Look at
last week’s solution to see what a typi-
cal solution looks like.
This week, the overall solution won’t
yield a worthwile picture, seeing as our
artistic skills are suffering from near
constant revision.
As usual, answers to puzzles.felix@
imperial.ac.uk.
