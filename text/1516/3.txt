working with the College to help im-
prove the community feel. This will
be realised in investments in common
rooms, the changes to the Holland Club
and a greater Union focus on activities
like buddying.
“Workload has also been a personal
campaign point. I felt during my degree
that I was doing work for the sake of
doing work, that I was over-assessed
and often asked to do something that
didn’t test or practice a new skill. We
have been encouraging departments to
use a flow-chart which originated in En-
gineering to ‘test’ whether assessments
are necessary and see whether you can
get people to develop their skills with
less time-consuming activities.”
Richard Bennett, an ISE student, said,
“I think Imperial has scored highly in
most places that we’d expect such as in-
dustry connections and facilities which,
in my humble opinion, are some of the
most important factors for academic
success. However, the one point that
worries me is the low score in the cate-
gory ‘I would recommend my universi-
ty to a friend’, which shows most of all
that Imperial students are possibly not
enjoying their university experience.”
Third year biologist, Joe Herbert,
commented that, “Imperial can never
achieve the same standard of social life
as universities which demand less work
but people come to Imperial knowing
they will have to work hard for a worth-
while degree.”
He added that, “If you want to spend
your whole time with your head in a
book, that’s your choice. Social life is
what you make of it.”
London universities generally scored
poorly with the highest ranking institu-
tion in the city being St George’s of the
University of London at 27th position.
UCL took 49th position, King’s College
took 55th while LSE was behind Impe-
rial at 85th position.
Oxford and Cambridge took fourth
and fifth positions, respectively. Oxford
was found to have the best quality staff
and lectures, and both obtained very
high scores in the category “I would
recommend my university to a friend.”
However, similarly to Imperial, both
scored low on “fair work load”.
The THE editor, John Gill, said,
“While universities must never put the
student experience before academic
concerns, its value to undergraduates
cannot be underestimated. We hope this
year’s survey will help universities to
raise their game, learn from the best and
meet the challenges of higher expecta-
tions and greater “consumer” demand.”
Imperial was placed 8th in the THE
World University Rankings for 2011-12
and 10th in The Guardian University
league table.
