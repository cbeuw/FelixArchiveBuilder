Hopefully, all should be well this

The debate continues...
T
he smaller clubs offer not
only a good social side
but also a side that means
experienced players and
newcomers can play along
side one another without the attitude
of “I play 1st XI hockey … I just hap-
pen to be good enough to be there!”
which generally makes a newcomer
think ‘what an absolute twat who has
his own ego firmly shoved up his own
backside’ and apprehensive about try-
ing new sports. I should state my po-
sition at this juncture, having played
for both IC and RSM. While playing
for the RSM we had members of many
other clubs and societies such as foot-
ball, OTC and running give it a go,
whereas IC has extremely rigid team
boundaries where players within the
club didn’t even move between teams
– god forbid newcomers try it out.
I’m an Engineer and I play RSM
hockey, so the faculty clubs are not
solely for faculty members and give the
opportunity for people with Imperial-
sized timetables the chance to try a
sport without a huge commitment.
Thesmallerclubsgenerallyplaysport
on alternative days to the IC clubs that
play BUSA leagues, and sticking to
what I know RSM hockey play regular
Sundaymixedhockeymatcheswhereas
IC hockey play regular men’s and wom-
en’s Wednesday matches with the odd
mixed hockey matches. This means a
lower time commitment in the smaller
clubs, and the ability to play another
sport as well. One member of the RSM
hockey team plays regularly on Sun-
days but also fences on Wednesdays
for IC Fencing Club, that opportunity
wouldn’t be available to him if he were
to join IC hockey.
The smaller clubs generally en-
joy a longer history and older tradi-
Tim Hartford-Cross says no to super-clubs
tions, dating back to when the medi-
cal schools and Constituent Colleges
(RCS, CGCU, and RSM) were separate
entities. It seems that the sports edi-
tors agree with the previous Rector’s
attitude in turning IC into a corporate
warehouse and scrapping any sort of
historical significance from the Col-
lege. It seems that the larger IC clubs
would happily hand in their old crests
for some lovely blue shaded arial font
branding.
Medics need their own clubs main-
ly because of their crazy timetables
which means they can fit training and
social side around schedules packed
with clinical and academic work. It
also means they can conveniently have
socials in the Reynolds around which
they all live, and play at Chiswick in-
stead of having to hike to Harlington.
History, tradition and medic pride
aside, it is no coincidence that every
university in the country has separate
medics sports teams.
The reputations of the clubs vary in
a way that attracts different types of
people. I know, for instance, that the
attitudes within IC Football Club de-
tract people from joining. Seven teams
are not big enough to enable all those
who come to trials (usually enough for
at least nine teams!). This is not a bad
thing but having an alternative for peo-
ple who want to play occasionally and
socially seems like a good all-inclusive
attitude that the union should have, af-
ter all we are stakeholders in the union
so we should all be able to get involved
if we want to.
As for the money, union funding cor-
responds to the numbers of members
and the number of leagues they are
part of etc. so why should some people
benefit from union funding and others
not. It seems a little elitist, after all it’s
a students union not a sporting prow-
ess union.
The IC teams are overflowing this
year as are the smaller clubs teams
leading to the question which bench
would the RSM players get to watch
the IC games from, ‘cause they sure as
hell aren’t getting more than stoppage
time on the pitch.
Imperial College player representing RSM in the 2008 Bottle Match
The starting line up was unchanged,
with the exception of debutant Jeff
Jia, who joined Eddie, Darius and
Yan. Eddie got us off to a flying start
with a stunning 3-0 victory over the
UCL number 1. Darius did just about
enough to win his first 3 matches.
The intensity of the match was such
that Christian felt he needed to take a
1 minute time out (perfectly legal, but
quite rare at our level of table tennis)
after a bloody good point from Darius.
Although the game had little bearing
on the outcome of the overall result, it
was the one which you could see Dar-
ius really wanted to win, and he did
just that by taking it in the decider.
Eddie, meanwhile, was going about
his business in typically economical
fashion, steamrolling through his op-
ponents. Jeff was having a very impres-
sive first appearance, winning 3-1 and
3-0 respectively against the UCL 1 and
2. It was thus quite surprising that he
lost against their number 3, but entire-
ly forgivable. He did end the evening
on a high by taking his final game in
straight sets. And Yan, described as
our “consistency man” by Darius, was
stayed true to form with 3 wins from 4.
UCL had a little consolation in taking
the doubles but this was a good night
for Imperial, and a much needed one.

SnowflakescascadeddownontheSho-
gun’s windshield en route to the aptly
named 2008 ‘Marlow Fours and Pairs
Head’. Except that it wasn’t in Marlow,
it wasn’t really a head race and scullers
were also competing. ICBC had seven
crews racing; two from the women’s
squad and five from the men’s squad,
all in coxed or coxless fours. Due to
threats of flooding the head race was
moved to Dorney lake and the usual 5
km head course was run in lanes less
There is snow business like row business
Christina Duffy than 2 km long. The serenity of the
outside snow suddenly became less at-
tractive when crews had to alight their
vehicles and were disgusted when the
realisation suddenly hit that what ap-
peared like fluffy white snow was actu-
ally a cold grey slush that stuck to your
face and dribbled down your neck.
Pre-race coffee could not be found
and the caffeine-free crew had to race
for time only since they were the sin-
gle entry in the W.S3 4- category. The
women’s coxed entry of Louise Hart,
Ro Smith, Selina Graham and Chloe
Symmonds with cox Larissa Matley
won the WS3.4+ in a time of 8:01.96.
Two seconds was the losing margin
for both men’s crews in the first divi-
sion of racing. Fireman Sam Henry
Fieldman coxed John Dick, Dom Mey-
rick-Cole, Tom Arnott and Will Todd
in the S2.4+ category. They came sec-
ond to Balliol College BC who finished
in 7:10.4. Following the testosterone-
filled performance seat 3 Meyrick-Cole
was beside himself with excitement: ‘I
didn’t know until after the race that I
was racing with the same Will Todd
that won Henley and Pair’s Head. He’s
such a man.’ The other men’s crew of
Matt Lunt, Mike Zammit, Chris Pol-
lock and Rob Tod coxed by Connie
Pidoux were defeated by Nephthys
who came home in 7:25.97.
In the afternoon’s division three
men’s crews were racing. In the senior
three coxless fours (S3.4-) ICBC had
two entries who finished in first and
second place. The winning crew were
composed of Alex Gillies, Richard
Winchester, Adam Seward and Andy
Gordon who clocked a time of 6:19.34.
10 seconds later were Tom Bell, Brook
McLaughlin, Iain Palmer and Josh Yer-
rell taking the runner-up position.
The final win of the day went to Ki-
eran Docherty, Leo Carrington, John
Davey and Adam Mayall in the S3.4+
coxed by Connie Pidoux. Their closest
rivals were Exeter university: 13 sec-
onds slower than the IC crew who won
in 6:35.23. Seat 3 Leo Carrington was
dubious at the initial crew selection:
‘With a volatile Scotsman at stroke I
was expecting some mid-race shout-
ing, but it wasn’t to be!’.
Winning S3.4 - crew Alex Gillies, Richard Winchester, Adam Seward and Andy Gordon. The song ‘row row row your boat...’ certainly doesn’t fit the occasion. Maybe next time
