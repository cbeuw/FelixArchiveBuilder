Make a pile of these for a ‘light’ lunch. The ingredients given are for
a simple quesadilla, but feel free to add anything you like to the mix.
For something more even substantial, add some refried beans and
guacamole on the side.
Serves 1
Ingredients:
2 tortilla wraps (on offer in Sainsbury’s at the moment)
A handful of grated cheddar cheese
A pinch of chilli flakes/fresh chilli
2 spring onions, chopped
Anything else you fancy
Place one tortilla on a hot, dry frying pan and put all the other ingre-
dients on top, ensuring the cheese goes to the edges of the tortilla.
Place the other tortilla on top and cook for one minute. Flip over the
quesadilla and cook on the other side for a further minute, until the
cheese is melted. The quesadilla should be brown and crispy on
both sides.
Remove from the pan and use scissors to snip into quarters. Sit and
devour. I can eat one portion in one mouthful – there’s a challenge.

A
fter loathingly seeing
my hard-earned holiday
income go to waste on
over-priced rent last year
I decided to hoard a little
for myself and pop over to the freezing
shores of La Belle France to Lille on a
quickie 24-hour trip for the Christmas
markets and Moules. The briefness of
my trip means my stomach capacity is
limited, but I will be back in time for
a full 12-hour stint of lab reporting on
Sunday. Whoopie.
After their lunchtime gorging of
Moules-Frites, cafés and restaurants
all around the city display mounds of
mussel shells outside their doors to
brag about how much they sold during
that day. I wonder if we should start
to do the same with our crisp packets,
pie dishes and coke cans? Not quite as
organic as Lille’s waste, but I’m sure
Tracey Emin would submit it for the
Turner Prize.
I have now started arming myself
with heavy objects every time I watch
the telly in the hope I might see Ker-
ry Katona’s bloody Iceland advert.
“CHICKEN TIKKA LASAGNE: ONE
POUND!” Fooking hell. Kerry, I think
that’s fusion food taken a little too far.
Can you imagine it?! Gently spiced
chicken tikka smothered in a thick,
gloopy white sauce layered between
egg lasagne sheets: this is not just shit
food – this is fusion food.
Anyhoo, in this week’s food page I
have adapted the food to fit the cold,
frosty days we are having. Being a har-
dy northern lass, nothing pleases me
more than coming in from -5°C out-
Do my boobs look
big in this?
side [in August] and gobbling down a
hefty portion of stew. Hence, I have in-
cluded my Goulash recipe which most
definitely warms you right to the core.
Be warned: the portions are massive
so feel free to adapt the recipe to suit
the size of the mouths you are feeding.
Goulash is one of those stews which
takes time, care and attention so for
the impatient amongst you I have also
included a quicker alternative to the
toasted sandwich for munchies.
If eating in ain’t your thing, I’ve in-
cluded two eateries for your delight.
Som Tam House is a mouth-watering
Thai restaurant on Askew Road near
Hammersmith and Shepherd’s Bush.
We used to live along Askew Road and
it is a very confused area. It is hemmed
in by middle class paradise at the BBC
White City on one side and the mul-
ticultural, bustling Goldhawk Road on
the other.
The outcome is a fabulous range of
restaurants with different cuisines but
all at very student-friendly prices. Give
Adam’s Cafe a try for bucketfuls of Mo-
roccan tagine or Bridge that Gap for a
builder’s fry-up.
Whilst you’re all freezing your balls
off in this Arctic weather, why not be
ironic and have some frozen yoghurt.
Snog is a cool place to hang out. For
the winter season they have added hot
toppings to their menu so shut up, tuck
in and enjoy it.
Apologies for the Nigella-esque pic-
ture this week. The new look ‘side-
shot’ editor photos mean I look like I
have had a breast augmentation.
Answers on a postcard.
Nigella can’t say no
Sumi, the Iranian where the freshly-
made bread is warm and crisp; and the
tiny Thai restaurant Som Tam House.
In keeping with the quiet neighbour-
hood, Som Tam House is cosy, warm
and inviting. The staff are suitably at-
tentive and the eccentric owner has a
large wardrobe full of gaudy Hawaiian
shirts which add to the otherwise mut-
ed colour scheme.
The two cooks at Som Tam were
trained at the famous Blue Elephant
restaurant in Fulham and it shows in
the exquisite food. The portions are
satisfyingly large and full of fresh in-
gredients. Be warned, however: when
the menu says “hot” they really mean
it. While you’re here you have to try the
restaurant’s namesake, Som Tam. Som
Tam is a green papaya salad which is
made to perfection here, of course!

displayed the customary reviews from
various free London papers. One of
them is particularly interesting. I am
in two minds over Nigella Lawson – I
admire her womanly power over a TV
camera but her forwardness does make
me cringe. “Squeeze the icing gently
over the smooth surface… oops! I got
some icing all around my perfectly
made-up lips.” [Follow speech with
much licking of fingers.] Beside this
qualm she has very good taste in Thai
restaurants.
Nigella apparently frequents Som
Tam when she’s filming her series. She
is quoted as saying the sticky rice is “to
die for.” I tested said rice to see if her
theory was correct. Yes, she is but I
have trouble visualising how she would
eat this in her sexy, sexy way.
Unless you are on a date and have to
concentrate hard on maintaining eye
or leg contact with your partner, the
other customers at Som Tam are very
interesting to watch discreetly. The
place seems to be jammed with tables
of high-powered BBC-types popping
in for tea on their way home to their
perfect dwelling places in Ravenscourt
Park.
Amusingly I notice they always ‘for-
get’ to remove their work ID badges.
They go through 3 courses and 2 bot-
tles of wine with BBC emblazoned
across their chests, just so the other
diners don’t disregard it. It all adds to
the charm of Som Tam House!
If you’re thinking of visiting Som
Tam, it even fills up during weekdays
so do book ahead if your party number
is more than two. Takeaway is offered
but you miss out on the comforting at-
mosphere and charm of this little gem.
Who would turn down amazing Thai
food with the added bonus of possi-
bly sitting on the spot where Nigella
parked her perfect buttocks?

Café, the wonderful Moroccan eatery;
Serves 4 very hungry people
3 tbsp oil
2 onions
900g braising steak (from a butcher expect to pay
£4)
½ tsp caraway seeds (optional)
2 red chillies, chopped
1 garlic clove
2 tbsp paprika
1 carrot, diced
1 stick of celery, chopped
1 parsnip, cubed
10g parsley
2 potatoes, cubed
1 tomato
3 tbsp tomato puree
1 green pepper
50g plain flour
2 tbsp egg
Goulash
If you’re ever hungry in Hungary, they will plonk a
bowlful of this spicy stew in front of you. It’s similar
to a bog-standard English winter stew with added
kick from paprika, chilli and caraway seeds. There
is really no need for extra carbs in the form of bread
because all you need is right there in your bowl. This
is comfort food at it’s best. Phwoar.
Soften the onions in the oil then add the steak. Cover
the pan and simmer for 15-20 minutes.
Bash together the caraway seeds, chillies and garlic
into an amalgam then add to the pan with 250ml wa-
ter. Cover again and simmer for 40 minutes. Give it a
stir then add the paprika, carrot, celery, parsnip and
parsley. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, make the ‘noodles’: form a dough from
the flour and egg then pinch/roll into vague long
shapes. Finally add your noodles, potatoes, toma-
to, puree and green pepper and boil for the last 15
minutes.
You’ve created a monster. Eat it – it’s yummy, like.
Do you remember your first Snog?
S
omeone has invented an ad-
dictive substance that has
no negative side effects. My
dealer is in South Kensington
and my drug is frozen yogurt.
Before you all faux-vomit in disgust, let
me tell you a little about SNOG.
Before I had my first Snog, I had
preconceptions that anything that
was healthy and sweet must taste like
shit. I admit I was wrong. Frozen yo-
gurt rules. Snog serves two flavours of
frozen yogurt – green tea and natural
– and there is a large variety of fruity
and cake-related toppings to go with

so refreshing that you can just sit in
the café all night and order rounds and
rounds of the stuff. Frozen yoghurt is
the perfect antidote to sitting at home
and getting through tubs of Häagen
Dazs or Ben and Jerry’s (depending on
what’s on offer in Sainsbury’s).
If you were wondering why on earth I
would try to sell a frozen yogurt shop to
you in the middle of winter, you would
definitely benefit from their ‘Winter
Wonderful’ warm toppings. Try a Nat-
ural Snog with a shot of expresso or an
apple crumble topping. The gorgeous staff are the second best thing at Snog
