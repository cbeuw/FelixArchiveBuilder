Stuff IC Students Like!? :)
Photoshop Competition -8
T
his week has been exciting,
hasn’t it? S.H.A.G week
has been a huge success,
with Captain Condom
(yours truly) dishing out
many S.H.A.G. bags full of condoms
and TLC lubricant. It was my birth-
day on Monday, messy times to say
the least. Best of all, felix won student
newspaper of the year! That’s right, we
are mega awesome. This time when I
say it though, it is a undisputed fact.
Sorry I am most definitely being arro-
gant. However I don’t think I am being
too unjust when I behave this way. I
truly love felix, and like Kadhim Shub-
ber’s past comment piece, I thoroughly
enjoy working with arguably the most
creative and diverse people who attend
Imperial College. Admittedly the stu-
dent awards were for last year’s collec-
tion of felix (well done Tom Roberts),
but we have the potential and talent to
make this year even better.
It really does amaze me how well a
student newspaper can do, especially
when you consider that all the contrib-
utors and editors are students them-
9. Maths:
A controversial one here this week,
but come on – we’re at Imperial. Deep
down inside we all have a fondness
for Maths. It’s not a full blown mar-
riage, just a small crush, similar to the
one you had on your French teacher
at school. Unless she was ugly. Or old.
Or a man. Or all of them. However
if you actually do Maths the question
has to be why? Ever met a normal
mathematician? Nope, me neither:
they’re all nutjobs in desperate need
of help and reintroduction to society.
It’s not easy to do that much Maths
and stay normal. It’s just not.

This week’s winner. No One! Next week’s RAW image for you to go wild. See www.felixonline.co.uk
Congratulationstothisweek’swinner,
No one. That’s right, no one entered.
Why? I tell you why. With all the epic
fails that’ve been happening recently.
we were unable to upload the high
resolution photo to our website. We
are very sorry, hopefully it won’t hap-
pen again.
Keep up the good work, and please
enter next week. With the amount of
failure from last week it’d be nice to see
a few good entries.
Drink with me, I’m Snaky B
and this week I’m dressed as Jack Dee

This week’s image is of Jovan Nedic.
Again. He looks pretty drunk. How
else do you explain Karaoke? More
importantly how tall is this guy on the
left? Freaking huge!!! Ah well I hope
you have fun this week.
Virgo
So you are a Virgo.
Good for you. No
really, that’s it.
No swearing, no
abuse, no nothing.
Virgoanites rock.
All the dudes are Virgoanites, look: Steve
McQueen, Nelson Mandela and H from Steps
are all Virgoanites and they’re literally too
cool for school. In fact I’m off to find a pretty
Virgoanite, I suggest you do too.
Scorpio
To all you aspiring
investment bankers:
it’s not happening,
give up. The token
jobs have dried up
too, so don’t waste
your time. It could be worse. You could have
a Siamese twin brother. He could be gay. And
you might only have one arsehole... Or have no
mates at Christmas. Or be a Sagittarius. Or all
of the above.
Libra
This week you cook
dinner for your
boyfriend. He sits
playing Warhammer
(fail) in the bedroom
while you forget the
basics of cooking in the kitchen. Somehow you
survive the meal (and a night with a boyfriend
who plays Warhammer) and finish your felix
column. You are later found chopped up in
Beit. See! Horoscopes aren’t ‘half-arsed’.
Sagittarius
You’re a medic. If
you haven’t realised
that yet, you’re in
for a rude awaken-
ing. There are peo-
ple waiting at every
street corner, eager to send you to hospital.
There, the doctor has a black eye from walking
around Hammersmith. You spend your life
having nightmares about a Rainbow, a lepre-
chaun and the pot of gold you’ll never find.
Capricorn
This week is
S.H.A.G. week.
However you
slightly misinterpret
the meaning of the
week and think
it’s SHAG week... like a big week of 15 hour
marathons that leave your penis so sore that
you are beginning to think that you may have
accidently slipped it into the George Foreman
when cooking sausages. Pint?
Cancer
Who else has their
homepage set to
live? ? No? Ah well...
that wouldn’t be
because it’s a small
insignificant forum
that JUST FUCKS THINGS UP? Well done for
unecessarly printing the name of the Hockey
Club in your “scoop” debate question? Oh and
well done for pointing out the truth later? Or
was it relying on felix to clean up your mess?...?
Gemini
In the famous words
of Phil Collins
“you’re no son of
mine.” Good. I don’t
want to be your son.
In fact there is a
rather long list of people I would rather have
as my father before you, that list even includes
Elton John and David Furnish... together... they
will be rather embarassing. However Mugabe
does not quite make it. No. That’d be silly.
Leo
I would like to
complain about
King’s College
Hockey Club’s
rampage last week
in Hammersmith.
This is precisely why Imperial chose to leave
the University of London – it’s students like
these that we just can’t be associated with. If
I was in charge over there at King’s I would
bounce those fuckers right out of BUCS.
Taurus
I don’t care. If you
are a Taurean you
can fuck off. I’m not
even going to get
into an argument
with you as it’s like
kicking a cripple- it’s just not right. You have
an IQ that is only slightly above that of room
temperature butter. I suggest you pop down to
the ELC and get a Postman Pat singalong tape.
Don’t try and put it in the CD player.
Aries
It’s going to be a
fucking shite week
for you. You will
get a hockey ball
in the face leaving
you with stitches,
fuck up all your finances as you forgot to cash
a £625 cheque from two months ago making
you go over your agreed overdraft limit. The
bank will then screw in charges and then steal
your anal virginity too... for shits and giggles.
Pisces
This week you make
some really cool
new friends that
you really look up
to. These dudes like
to kick inflated pigs
bladders round. Obviously not when throwing
glasses at houseboats, smashing up numerous
pubs or chanting “you’re a cunt”. I would like
to point out, with the upmost respect that no
mate, you’re the cunt.
Horoscopes, the bread and butter of society
Aquarius
Ahh dear sweet
Aquarius, how
welcoming is
it to see your
face? About as
welcoming as Jade
Goody’s shit in a jacuzzi, i.e. not very. Want to
know why? I have to waste my time ranting on
twelve separate subjects just for you to tell me
that you don’t like you Horoscope. Well I have
news for you. I don’t give a runny poo.
Gordon Ramsay likes to say ‘fuck off’. We like to say ‘fuck off’ to helpful Horoscopes. So we did
FUCWIT
League Table
Sorry for the lack of blurb here guys. There has been some team
transfers, some re-branding and some total silence from teams.
Top of the Table have joined forces with Martin 08’ so that they
have a cryptic crossword member and are now known as Shotgun.
Mochten sie mein Manschaft are close behind them, eager to take
the top spot away from them. A quick note, teams will only get
three prizes, i.e. you can only have three members per team. This is
just to stop everyone joining forces.
5 points for the first correct answers for Slitherlink, Wordoku, Pho-
toshop Competition and Quick Crossword. 4 points for second, 3
points for third, 2 points for fourth and 1 point for fifth.
Double points will be awarded for correct cryptic crossword an-
swers, because it’s über hard.
Simple! Now then FUCWITs, send in your answers to felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk or sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk. Go!

selves. They don’t get paid, they don’t
get any benefits now that I mention it.
They do get the satisfaction that their
hard work in the field of journalism is
read by the vast majority of the Imperi-
al College populace. This includes not
only the students, but staff as well.
For me though, it is all about the
small close-knit community formed
by the felix team. The guys down in
the office are all good friends, we all
work together, drink together and even
just waste about together doing noth-
ing constructive. Kadhim hit it home
with his love for felix, and I’m taking
this opportunity to mirror his feelings.
There is a lot of love in felix (not the
sexual kind thank you... well maybe)
and there is a lot more to give. I hope
that anyone reading this will think to
themselves “maybe I don’t have to be
the most intelligent or sporty person
to be part of something grand and suc-
cessful?” If you’re one of those people,
get a hold of us and join our team. We
are constantly looking for contribu-
tors, editors, comment pieces, photos
or anything else.

Hokays. So we fucked up. Again. The more
astute ones amongst you may have noticed that
the clue for 9 across may have been missing.
I did this as I didn’t want Top of the Table
to win. They did. Now I’m pissed. Next week
I am going to print an invisible Quickie and
lets see if you can still do it then. I think not.
I may have also fucked up on clue 16 across...
that was supposed to be ‘potion’ not ‘portion’.
However the upside is that I don’t give a shit!
HAHA I bet you did not recognise
me in my clever disguise?! I will put
you simple people out of your misery.
If you look very closely, under that
drab Jack Daniels exterior it is still
your beloved Snaky B. You see, I bet
that made you breathe a sigh of relief.
Panic is over, stop reaching for that
comforting fag – your favourite Snaky
B has not disappeared, I am merely
disguising myself to hide from those
pesky spies. They are everywhere, I
tell you. Everywhere. They lurk on
the dark street corners, under the
benches and in projectors of lecture
theatres. They have even sunk so low

that they have infiltrated your sanctum
sanctorum – the Union. They come
disguised as students sporting floor-
length black (fake) leather coats and
sour expressions, casually they strike
up conversations with unsuspecting
students. Do not be deceived, for
despite their ordinary appearance, they
are in fact passing information over to
the other side. They are going to get
me unless I remain in hiding. If you
see me wondering the corridors of the
college, please address me only as Mr.
Jack D. I fear not for my own safety but
for the safety of our country. Nobody
is safe while they are on the loose.
