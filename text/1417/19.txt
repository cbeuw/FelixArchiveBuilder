ArabicSoc win!
Last Saturday the Overseas Societies
Committee held their annual five-a-
side football World Cup tournament.
Twenty one teams representing sixteen
societies braved the freezing weather
to turn up at Kensington Leisure Cen-
tre, to battle for the trophy. All the pas-
sion of the real World Cup was there
along with diving, disallowed goals and
contentious refereeing decisions.
After a slow start, trying to get
groups and fixtures sorted out, the
games began. Trying to fit thirty four
group games onto three pitches is no
easy task! Gradually though, results
became to come through. The differ-
ence in quality between the teams was
obvious, with hungover teams of near
strangers in tracksuits being torn apart
by well organised teams who train and
play together. Most teams took it all in
good stead, taking their victories and
defeats with grace and humour.
Due to the odd number of teams
taking place, the winners of the five
groups plus the three best runners up
passed into the quarter finals. They
were Arabic Society’s first and second
team, Punjabi Society, Sri Lankan Soci-
ety, Thai Society, Iraqi Society, French
Society’s second team and Cypriot So-
cieties second team.
Arabic Soc 1 steam rollered Sri
Lankan Soc 5-1, and Arabic Soc 2 beat

UCL thrashed hard by ladies
Football
Imperial Women’s 1st XI 16
RUMS Women’s 2nd XI 0
The ladies 1sts had vowed revenge on a
far from friendly group of UCL players
after the rascals defeated our beloved
2nds earlier in the season. However
despite the passion it was a slow start,
great play by everyone’s favourite Slop-
py Seconds and MOM Stripper on the
left encouraged a few attacks however
it took a quick run by urban legend
Praying Mantis to secure the first goal.
After that the shots began to flow,
encouraged from the sideline by her
new lover, Prince Charles was on fire,
creaming the ball into the back of the
net. Several goals followed with a de-
flection by fresher Sam and an unlikely
slap by defender Token Lezza.
Even at half time when we believed
we’d crushed the last of UCL’s spirit a
whisper of hope was heard, “they’ll be
tired in the second half and they won’t
want to win”, suffice to say they weren’t
the sharpest pencils in the box. Un-
fortunately for UCL the pace only in-
creased in the second half, with great
goals from Slippery Nipple and Fresher
Shanika.
The final goal was a strong short
corner which left the opposition in ir-
retrievable goalless pit of doom. Not
all good though, obviously thinking
about the copious fines she’d collected
over the last 2 weeks Stripper resorted
to trying to knock herself out in avoid-
ance, this didn’t work but the tech-
nique was adapted to involve snakebite
later that night. Silly rabbit, trix are for
kids!
The fact that gullible had been re-
moved from the English dictionary
earlier in the week also blatantly had
an effect on the IQ’s of half the team,
as Stripper enquired exactly how Lep-
Cheryl See
er shat on the pitch and also Praying
Mantis’ excitement at the arrival of
a famous postman before the game
stunned audiences pitch wide. Howev-
er you don’t need brains to play hockey
and the superior fitness of the Imperial
team showed through towards the end,
either that or UCL (who coincidently
arrived late) had spent too long in the
pie shop before the game. Fines were
dealt out at the union for DOD Slip-
pery Nipple for finding herself on the
floor with her legs open for the second
time this week (anyone ever find those
knickers?) and resident card collector
Wide Open for something of a similar
nature.
Also special mention to the appro-
priately named Dominator for her
successes on and off the pitch, (we all
saw you sucking the face off ICHC’s
favourite serial killer). In conclusion
a successful defeat, and the answer to
the mystery who ate all the pies? Well,
the ladies firsts can confirm, it was
definitely UCL.
Punjabi Soc 2-1. In a bad tempered
match, French 2 made it past Cypriot 2
with a last minute goal to win 3-1. Iraqi
Soc beat Thai Soc 3-1, to give the semi
finals a distinctly Arabic flavour.
Arabic 1 beat Iraqi Soc 2-1, and
Arabic 2 beat French Soc 2-1 to set up
an all Arabic Society final. Plans for
a third place play off had to be aban-
doned, as the French sulked off, award-
ing third place to Iraqi Soc by default.
By now the games were being played
under floodlights, and the temperature
had dropped even further to close to
freezing.
The final was perhaps not the dra-
matic affair that we had hoped it to
be, but that is not to say that it was not
competitive. Both sides clearly wanted
to win, to secure bragging rights over
the other half of the society. Arabic 1
raced into a 3-0 lead, before Arabic 2
made it back to 3-2 by half time. In the
second half, Arabic 1 made it to 5-2,
before Arabic 2 pulled one back. The
final score ended as 6-3 to Arabic 1,
who celebrated with the trophy.
All things considered, the day went
extremely well and most people en-
joyed themselves. As always, there
must always be losers to have a winner,
and things have to end in disappoint-
ment for most of the teams. Still, it
was a fun if tiring day out, and the bar
night at the Union afterwards was well
received.
IC Women’s Football travelled to the
UCL grounds last Sunday to face
RUMS 2s in disgusting stay-in-bed
weather.
Following a slew of unfortunate re-
sults, IC were looking for a long de-
served win. Starting with a 4-4-2 for-
mation, Barbara Kiskovski and Lily
“Genghis” Low were up front, with
Yoke Thye and Pav S on the wings and
DD and debutant Marion Ferrat in cen-
tre midfield. The back line consisted of
Laura, Cheryl, Kendra and Steph, and
Emily in goal. IC began the game with
promise and Kendra was given a free
role allowing her to push up to sup-
port the midfield. Taking advantage
of a momentary break in the weather,
Genghis Low provided the opening
goal, smashing the ball it into the back
of the net. The rain came back heavier
than before a few seconds later but IC
were not deterred and Genghis Low
scored again, and then again, thriving
off DD’s crosses and through balls. A
few minutes after Genghis Low got her
hat-trick, Pav casually flicked the ball
past the keeper and into the back of
the net.
The only players in the IC half for
most of the first half were goalkeeper
Emily and Cheryl who was acting
sweeper. Right winger Yoke was feeling
fatigued and switched positions with
Cheryl but neither thought it crucial to
tell the rest of the team causing confu-
sion which RUMS took advantage of.
They bounced the ball about a bit in
the IC half but to no avail since Yoke
has the capacity to take on three play-
ers. Cheryl made it up to the team later
scoring IC’s fifth goal off a cross from
Laura. Then a few minutes after that,
Dehydys dribbled through the throng
of RUMS players to put the ball in the
goal. Lily scored again but by this time
she was considered old news.
Dina came on at half time for the
aging Yoke and played right back as
Steph was shifted to fill the space in
right midfield. Dina came on with
a bang and soon enough was taking
down a girl twice her size. After seeing
Barbara take shot after shot and not
scoring, she finally broke the dam and
scored three.
The rest of the goals came from
Genghis and Dehydys, who hit an
amazing shot from the right edge of
the 18 yard box. Marion had an im-
pressive game with countless shots on
goal but unluckily was unable to get
herself a debut goal. On the other side
of the pitch, goalkeeper Emily had an
enthralling match, standing miles off
her goal line whilst craving vocally for
a cup of tea. Pav netted the last goal
a few minutes before full time. Final
score was 16-0.
By the end of the first week of Fresher’s
(a few years ago now) I was sick and
tired of explaining the game of rackets,
therefore in the next few paragraphs I
shall endeavour to describe this most
prestigious of racquet sports.
A bit of history….
In its earliest form during the 18th
Century, rackets was played in the
open on the walls of the yards of the
two main debtor’s prisons, the King’s
Bench and the Fleet. Gentleman had
nothing else to entertain themselves
until they paid there creditors. Dick-
ens mentions rackets in the Pickwick
Papers, as Mr. Pickwick was unlucky
enough to be put into the Fleet.
Outside prisons and taverns, Harrow
was the first school at which rackets
was played, probably from the early
1820s when the schoolyard was en-
larged. When the first Lawn Tennis
Championships were played at Wim-
bledon later in the century, Old Har-
rovian rackets player Spencer Gore
would win the singles.
The court itself…
Imagine a squash court, multiply it
by 3, the service boxes are outside the
two main playing boxes other than that
the same markings as a squash court
and the 4 walls are made of stone. The
racquet is styled on the old wooden
squash rackets and is still wooden to-
day believe it or not due to tension of
the string being far too great for any
other material (even titanium). The
Rackets – the
unknown game (to
Imperial Students)
Sam Barclay ball is slightly smaller than a golf ball
and has changed in its content dramat-
ically since first game was played (all
still are hand made and cost roughly
£9), details of which I won’t bore you
with but lets just say from personal
experience when the ball is travelling
at over 120mph on the court it hurts
when it hits you!
Who plays…
One of the main reasons of the
rackets population being so small, is
that bar for a handful courts in North
America, the only people who learn to
play in the UK from a tender age of 13-
14 are those who attended one of the
13 schools in England that have courts.
Even within those schools not many
play due to the demanding nature of
the game (quick feet and excellent
hand-eye coordination are key), from
my own school generally it was the
1st XI opening batsman or the 1st pair
tennis that were upto the challenge.
However I would encourage anyone if
they get the chance to go on court or
even watch just experience the speed
of the game, which I find is the addic-
tive part.
Imperial Players
To my knowledge at this present mo-
ment, there are only 2 rackets players
in entire university (and we used to
play for our respective schools against
each other not too long ago). If there
are any of you out there, please contact
me or indeed if you would like to try
a new sport I would be most happy to
show you this wonderful game.

Hi Dan, thanks very much for
meeting us today. Firstly, can you
tell us how you ascended from
1st year medical student to cap-
tain of the 1st team?
Well I didn’t really have the best of
starts in my first year as I was injured,
but I managed to make it back in time
for Varsity was included in the squad,
which was great. We had a very good
fly half in my second year and so I
didn’t feature that much, but he has
now left and I just seemed to have slot-
ted into his place. I had a solid season
last year and was lucky to get voted in
as captain for this year.
How has the start of the season
been for you guys then?
We started off the season with a lot
of injuries, but now we have settled and
have a very good, young squad mainly
comprising of players in their 2nd,
3rd and 4th years. We’ve really come
together now and have won three out
of the last four games beating UWE,
Swansea and Imperial, and we are
looking to push on up the league table.
Where do you see yourself finish-
ing this season?
Our league is very hard at the mo-
ment, there’s no doubt about that.
We’re hoping to finish in the top half
of the table, with the aim of finishing
in the top three. But we will have to see
how everything goes after Christmas.
Imperial Medicals have been in
the Premiership for several years
now, how do you think you are
able to sustain such a high level?
We’ve always been a good side ever
since the medical schools merged, and
have always been in a high league apart
from one year, which I think was in my
first year, but we were promoted the
year after. We’re very lucky to have 6
years worth of students, so we have
players that are that little bit older,
have that little more experience and
are slightly stronger than some of our
other opponents.
A lot of it is really experience though.
Because we have been in the Premier-
ship for three years we know how to
cope, we’ve learnt how to play in the
league, learnt when to put the squeeze
on teams. It is especially important
against some of the big rugby universi-
ties such as Cardiff and Swansea.
Does the 1st team have any aspi-
ration to go further and perhaps
aim for promotion into Premier-
ship A?
That is definitely our aim, there is
no point being in a league of you don’t
think you aren’t going to win it. Like
I said, we have a very good bunch of
players coming through and definitely
within the next two years I can see us
pushing for promotion.
Moving onto Varsity, the Col-
lege side gained promotion into
your league and you mentioned
that you played them a couple of
weeks ago. How can you see the
Medicals retaining their perfect
win record against an ever im-
proving College side?
Imperial have definitely improved
over the past four years, there is no
doubt about that. After playing them
this season, it is clear that they raise
their game for Varsity. I think we al-
lowed the score a couple of weeks ago
to get close, we gave away a lot of pen-

interviews the Imperial Medicals rugby captain and wants to know how they do it!
alties that we shouldn’t have. I think we
can only get better, but Varsity is Var-
sity, it will definitely be a close one.
We know the medics have won
the rugby and netball matches.
Why do you think the other teams
aren’t able to do the same?
I think the other sports have definite-
ly improved, the hockey men’s team
have been promoted and have got bet-
ter over the last couple of years, and
I know they desperately want to win
Varsity and believe they can do it. The
same with women’s hockey. Football
I’m not so sure about. Imperial are very
strong in a few sports, such as football
and squash. It would be great to see a
few more of the medicals’ teams com-
pete against IC and maybe make the
overall competition a little closer this
year.
Imperial Medicals have won the
United Hospitals Cup for the past
9 years now, more often than not
playing against the same op-
ponent. Do you not find it a little
repetitive?
The cup is the oldest in the world, so
to just scrap it after 150 years of his-
tory is something I don’t want to be
involved with it. I’d much rather
keep that going. There have
been some great names that
have played in that compe-
tition, such as JPR Wil-
liams.
Yes
Guys, Kings and
St. Thomas are the
main opponents we
see every year, but still
come out absolutely
fired and pumped up for
it. It’s the same with Var-
sity, we have to be strong and
ensure a victory, because if we lost
either, we would get rinsed and I cer-
tainly don’t want that to happen.
I asked this question last week.
What input have Sport Imperial
have, if any, to your team and
club?
I think Sport Imperial have been fan-
tastic, in particular Nick Gore. They
have supported us, and whenever
we’ve had a problem, they‘ve been able
to solve it. For example the first game
of the season against UWE, I didn’t
realise that both teams played in a red
kit, so Sport Imperial kindly got us the
Imperial blue kit to play in.
Moving onto the social side,
ICSMRFC go on several tours, can
you give me a summary of what
you guys have been up to?
We’ve just got back from an unbeat-
Bartos as he is better known in the club, is a very
talented fly half with a great eye for a gap and a
remarkable ability to read the game. Bartarse is also
quite the lad off the pitch and can always be found
surrounding himself with the fairer sex. In his 2nd year
he abandoned his testicles and learnt to sing for a light
opera performance, which most speculate was due to
the show’s 75% female cast.

en tour of South Africa
over the summer. We
also do an inter-year
match, which was last
weekend, as well as a
schools tour, where
this year we went to
Birmingham. We also
have the oldest rugby
club tour in the world,
where we go down to
Cornwall. The social
side is a very impor-
tant side of rugby,
particulary with the
medical spirit where
we take our rugby
very seriously, but
tend to enjoy
afterwards as
well.
Now a
contro-
versial
question,
but what do
you have to say
to those medi-
cal students who
are playing for IC
teams?
I think they should
play for the medical
school.Always!We’ve
come from a history of St. Mary’s,
Charing Cross and Westminster that
have been going for 150 years, longer
than Imperial College. We may have
amalgamated and Imperial may have
their own sports, but I think medical
students have their own separate iden-
tity. The atmosphere is amazing and all
the different sports teams get on well
together, and since they have come to
study medicine they should play with
the medical school sports teams, in my
opinion.
Medical students are very busy,
especially in their later years.
How do the students, particu-
larly the rugby players, manage
to cope with the workload and
maintaining the high sporting
demands?
It’s very hard,
let’s put it that
way. Basically,
and I am finding
this now as I’m in
my fourth year of
medical school, that
you have to often re-
organise things. So for
example if you have to be
in on a Wednesday to meet with
your consultant because they are
only there on a Wednesday, you have
to try and re-organise to meet with
them on a different day when it is con-
venient for both of you. A lot of final
years have to do that and try and make
up the time elsewhere.
There are times, unfortunately, when
rearranging a meeting is not possible,
as was the case this Wednesday, where
two of our back row players can’t play.
One is a final year and has to do his
shift in the A&E department whilst
the other one had a presentation to
give. Also sometimes if you’ve got an
away game, you can’t afford to miss the
whole of Wednesday. I think it’s some-
thing that people have had to deal with
for several years, there is always a way
to get out of it and ways around it to
make sure that people can still play
rugby.
This was bound to come up, but
can you explain the whole light
opera scene and are there any
aspirations on the stage?
That was something I dabbled with
and it had to be tried at least once, erm
but not again. I did do drama for A-
level and came prepared at my inter-
view because I knew they were going
to ask me about it. But I did enjoy it,
apart from the abuse I got on the last
performance when the entire rugby
club came and watched, which wasn’t
so nice.
Similar sort of question to what
we asked last week to round up,
looking at other sports at Impe-
rial. Let’s just start with do you
know what orienteering is?
I should know because I read it last
week... but I can’t remember!
