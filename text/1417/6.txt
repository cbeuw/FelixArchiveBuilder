An interesting interview with Dr Phil
Hammond in a short podcast entitled
“We’re British, we don’t talk about sex”
(“sex” being a euphemism, in this case,
for genital warts; so by doing that we’ve
already gone and confirmed our Brit-
ishness, haven’t we?). Dr Phil’s recent
article, published in the BMJ, about
the hypocrisy of the NHS regarding
the HPV vaccination – purporting to
offer ‘choice’ while at the same time
denying it by offering only one vaccine,
produced by our favourite evil phar-
maceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline –
caused a bit of a fuss in the medical
community, so he defends his thinking
to BMJ editor Rebecca Coombes. Is this
another case of government pandering
to big-pharma? We can’t be sure, but
their woefulness in dealing with the
situation lent a hand to the Daily Mail’s
ongoing campaign of vitriol against all
things NHS-y and good.

Lancet
The Lancet does a nice series of 10-
minute weekly podcasts summing up
health news and research around the
world. Each week a different guest
discusses a particular issue, ranging
widely across themes such as malaria
funding, global health policy, and cut-
ting-edge research on MS treatments.
Web editor Richard Lane presents, and
his guests range from the engaging to
the fantastically dull. A good way of
keeping up to date with medical news,
if you can withstand the tinder-dry
content.

This Saturday a sleek new exhibit
opens at the Science Museum: Japan
Car - Designs for the Crowded Globe.
Japanese have already had to deal with
issues of over-crowding and pollution
and this can be seen in their high-
tech green car designs. Director of the
exhibit said that this exhibit “offers
glimpses of the future” and this is es-
pecially true of Toyota’s new concept
i-Real (see picture to the right). i-Real
sees a car as a mobile cell that interacts
with the passenger and other vehicles
and allows you to go “wherever you
want”.

Just a couple of minutes away from the
Imperial’s campus, this year’s Wildlife
Photographer of the Year Exhibit in the
Natural History Museum continues to
amaze the visitors. Winners were an-
nounced recently and the exhibit is
open until 26th of April 2009.
This year’s overall winner was a pho-
tograph of a snow leopard, one of the
rarest animals in the world. It took Na-
tional Geographic’s photographer Ste-
ve Winter ten months to capture three
photos of this amazing animal, the
other two photos were also higly com-
mended at this year’s exhibit. Whereas
it took him almost a year to take only
a few photos, the overall winner in
the Young Wildlife Phtographer of the
Year, Catriona Parfitt said she took
thousands of photos at her three-week
holiday in Africa. She then, for the first
time send one of them to the competi-
tion and it became a winner.
Apart from rare animals such as
snow leopards, this year’s exhibition
also features many human-like ape im-
ages that make one wonder about our
attitude towards wildlife but also give a
good starting point to thinking about
evolution.
Luckily, if one starts pondering about
whether we evolved from monkeys.
for a better grasp of our evolution and
natural selection just across the hall
there is a new temporary exhibit about
Darwin.

the year exhibit on display Medical Matters – Podcast of the
Week
We couldn’t have a Podview without
a Radio 4 entry, and as usual Auntie
is head and shoulders above the rest.
Well-chosen stories introduced with a
sense of humour – David Brent talk-
ing, wince-inducingly, about race: “You
are half-and-half, aren’t you?”; “Mixed-
race, yes”; “That is my favourite. That’s
the melting pot, please” – lead on to
discussions on issues like the phe-
nomenon of ‘colour blindness’ in US
children, who refuse to mention some-
one’s race when it’s different to their
own. We also get a round-up of cur-
rent news, for example the new Mental
Health Act coming into force this week
– what will it mean for psychiatrists
and patients? – plus a disturbing trend
of suicides among ageing South Asian
women in the UK. If you’re not keen
on the specialist nature of the other
podcasts, but still like to keep abreast
of health news in society, this comes
highly recommended.

Darwin’s Big Idea
Mico Tatalovic
Science Editor
Last week Natural History Museum
opened its doors to another one of ex-
hibits dedicated to celebration of 200th
anniversary of Charles Darwin’s birth
and 150th anniversary of the publica-
tion of his notorius On the Origins
of Species in which he presented his
mechanism for how evoluion works:
natural selection.
The exhibit is organised so that visi-
tors can re-trace how Darwin came to
his conlcusions and the ambient light-
ing and sounds of tropical birds all add
to the experience. Where the exhibit
maybe fails is in the lack of modern-
day examples of evolution and more
recent discussions of evolution and its
mechanism. It is also too quiet about
discrediting creationism, leaving it to
a single, rather boring video. All in all
though it is an exciting and insightful
exhibit to visit. It runs until 19th April
2009

American researchers are working on
a new implant that hopes to provide
deaf people with better hearing than
that currently achieved using cochlear
implants.
Research on guinea pig cells showed
that nerves in the ear can be stimulated
by infrared light, as well sound, lead-
ing to an electrical signal being sent
back to the brain. Infrared stimulation
leads to as sharp information quality
reaching the brain as that produced by
sound in hearing guinea pigs.
Dr Claus-Peter Richter, from North-
western University, Illinois, is now
working on producing fibre optic de-
vices for use within the inner ear and
is hopeful of a possible device being
developed at some point in the distant
future.
A study published in the new Royal
Society of Chemistry journal Metal-
lomics has announced the success in
using a garlic chemical to treat diabe-
tes types I and II.
Scientists in Japan found that when
a drug based on a chemical found in
garlic was taken in tablet form, blood
glucose levels were reduced in type I
diabetic mice.
The drug is based on a vanadium-al-
lixin compound that in previous work
has successfully been used to treat both
types of the illness when injected.
With sufferers of type I diabetes cur-
rently having to take daily insulin injec-
tions and type II diabetics treated with
drugs causing unwanted side-effects,
the researchers are keen to expand
their work by testing the garlic chemi-
cal drug in humans.
The Royal Society of Chemistry has
ruled that Yorkshire puddings must be
four inches tall for them to be success-
ful as a roast dinner accompaniment.
Following an American plea for
advice on cooking the dish, the RSC
sought advice from some of its thou-
sands of members who work in the
food and drinks industries.
“Cooking is chemistry in the kitchen
and one has to have the correct formu-
la,” a Yorkshire scientist confirmed.
The RSC will next year be publish-
ing a leaflet advising how to make the
ideal Yorkshire pudding as part of its
food campaign.
