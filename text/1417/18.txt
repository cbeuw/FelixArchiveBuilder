Top of the Table won again. Will some
of you get off your arses and complete
this shitty Slitherlink, then send the
fucker in. I don’t mean to be grumpy,
but I am so that’s how it comes across.
How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be
one continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.
Yer yer yer. Top of the Table and
top of my pissed off list won by
finding the rather mature word
‘FORNICATE’. Trust me it’ll be
back to the usual childish rude
words this week but I ran out
of inspiration. Like I have now.
Seriously I’m fucking grumpy.
I
t is a truth universally acknowl-
edged that a single man in pos-
session of a good degree must
be in want of a date. Having
spoken to many of you around
campus, I have found several lost souls
confused about the idea of blind dat-
ing. I’ve decided to dedicate this week’s
column to this weird and wonderful
phenomenon.
In this time of desperation some of
you will be resorting to desperate and
some may think controversial tech-
niques. By being set up with a stranger
by your friends, or even worse - an ex,
does it make you as brave as Rambo or
is it just reckless? Of course admitting
to this particular habit can sometimes
feel like social (Part of Speech: adjec-
tive. Definition: Of, characterized by,
or inclined to living together in com-
munities. Synonyms: gregarious) sui-
cide. All stigmas aside, the reasons this
topic will get most people hot under
the collar are:
1. Fear of being stood up - just imagine:
you have already bought the cinema
tickets/drinks and as you look around,
you find yourself surrounded by know-
ing smiles and pitying glances.
2. Mystery date being a munter.
3. Mystery date does not fall madly in
love with at first sight. Bloody rude.
In my opinion, agreeing to a blind date
is not as desperate as Cosmo would
have us believe. There are some among
you for whom a weekly drunken shag
and waking up squinting in horror
at the right side of the pillow is suf-
ficient and the whole hog of Burger
King and a trip to Fulham Broadway
cinema beforehand is superfluous to
requirements. Blind dating is not for
you. For the rest of you, however, it
really is rather practical. Your friends
are probably just sick of your moping
about in need of a good shag, spending
your time reading Jane Austen novels
or playing on your racing computer
games and they do have your best in-
terests at heart.
Sadly, blind dating, just like dinosaurs
in their day and like Tamagochis, are
set to become a thing of the past. In
the modern era when you are just a
hop and skip away from ‘facebook-
ing’ the candidate before your friends
even have time to describe his wonder-
ful sense of humour which completely
detracts from the huge nose and acne.
There are, of course, come serious ad-
vantages to this mild (in most cases)
form of stalking, for example, discover-
ing that you have actually met this per-
son before and already know that you
do not find the idea of another lengthy
discussion of how medicine is only true
profession which will take him straight
on to the Fast Track to Heaven in the
slightest appealing. On the contrary,
it would be a shame to be put off by a
photo of him sporting fish net tights, a
bra stolen from a girl he secretly wishes
he could play hanky-panky with and a
blonde synthetic wig. Maybe not. Per-
haps, for a more open-minded and au-
thentic dating experience it’s better to
dive in with minimal details: no phone
number, surname or maybe even de-
scription. Gender, I should think, is
still crucial.
“Would you like to come up for some
coffee/to see my collection of WW2
stamps?” Sex after a blind date is sim-
ply not what one does. Is it? In our
liberal and democratic (as opposed
to liberal democratic) society is there
an issue of having some harmless fun
without a series of doorway kisses for
several weeks in a row? With S.H.A.G.
week here, surely all of you are now
armed with the means to have fun
without the consequences resulting
in alien discharges. Health and safety
aside, you can do whatever you want,
just be prepared for a week of mock-
ery from aforementioned friends. You
know you’d do the same for them.
Most importantly, don’t forget to thank
those friends (or that pesky ex who just
can’t seem to let you get on with your
own life) when the blind date they so
thoughtfully arranged for you results
in a night of passion or even just an
evening with a person who does not
stimulate your gag reflex upon setting
eyes on them. Gratitude is very impor-
tant. As is revenge in the event that
they set you up with a loser.

Freshly Squeezed!
Jumper Watch. A MechEng-er has
been seen wearing the same grey zip-
up hoodie for literally weeks now. We
know you own another jumper since
your foray into risqué navy last week,
but you just couldn’t say goodbye to
good ol’ grey. At least give it a wash.
Bear Alert. Two lovely ladies have
already fallen prey to our resident
grizzly’s charms this week. Having
started to roam farther than the
borders of his well-trodden Polish
territory, the Bear has now taken on
higher aspirations. Earlier this week
he was found advancing on Greece
to sweep a red-booted beauty off her
feet and become King. Our fickle
ursine friend then set his sights on
the RCC “secretary”… perhaps those
knitted condoms will come in useful
after all?
Timber Ho! What is it about that
humble wardrobe staple, the
lumberjack shirt, that encourages
such nauseating self-confidence?
Rugby’s Karaoke Cocktails provided
one flannel-clad songstress with the
perfect opportunity to belt out an
obviously well-rehearsed number.
This casts a shadow on the good
naturedkaraokephilosophy.Justdon’t
do it. Another barn dance attendee
decided to show off her Michael
Jackson “here’s one I prepared
earlier” moves on Wednesday… not
very sporting.
Wedding Bells. Having declared their
love for one another on the gospel of
truth that is Facebook only a matter
of minutes into their first date, it is no
surprise that the smitten MechEng re-
fresher and saucy bisexual medic are
taking things to the next level. This
weekend he’s meeting her parents
to discuss marriage, dogs and the
football team’s worth of children they
are planning to produce. And it hasn’t
been two weeks yet. Let’s hope he
doesn’t let her paint his nails again…
Bye­
-bye to men falling off motorbikes.
We know no one replied to your
caption competition and that the
Editor pulled it as a result. The
embarrassment must be unbearable.

Rugby 2nds outperform Portsmouth
From the kick-off, Portsmouth made a
series of off-loads out of the tackle to
rumble well into our half. At the break-
down, Imperial gave away the first of
a series of stupid penalties, and the
resulting kick to touch from the op-
position fly-half immediately had us
defending on our try-line. Again at the
break-down from the lineout Imperial
gave away another needless penalty,
and Portsmouth caught us napping
with a quick tap and go, resulting in
their big No.8 crashing over the line.
They converted, putting us 7-0 behind
after just a matter of minutes.
The next 5 minutes proceeded with
little incident. Imperial clearly had an
ascendency in the forwards, possibly
due to Niall informing his opposite
man that he did, in fact, have AIDS.
However we failed to produce any sort
of continuity, due to a combination of
sloppy hands and needless penalties.
Then, with Imperial looking a little
flat, Scott provided the spark needed
to get the team going. With Port-
smouth clearly wanting to mark Sasha
the Basha at 13, coupled with the prop-
like nature of the opposition 12, a gap
emerged in the 12-13 channel. Scott
darted through with a big hand off
to the slow inside centre’s chest, then
stepped through the fullback’s weak
tackle to score Imperial’s first try. The
conversion levelled the scores to 7-7.
Portsmouth soon began to reveal
their game-plan. Their only big talent
of note was the boot of their fly-half.
More needless penalties had Port-
smouth gaining territory for fun. In-
deed, half-way through the first half,
from a ruck just inside our 22, the ball
was passed back to their 10 who slot-
ted a drop-goal through the posts to
put Portsmouth back in the lead.
It was at this point that Imperial
started to come to life. Our ascend-
ency in the forwards continued, with
Chilli and debutant Chris McGeough
stealing opposition line-out ball at will,
and the scrum always going forward,
stealing ball against the head on nu-
merous occasions. We were stringing
phases together and made yards with
ease. For the first time this season we
used the mutes and munsters to great
effect, with stand-in captain Malcolm
so often sucking in the Portsmouth
defence with his hard running. It was
from a breakdown about 10m from the
opposition try-line that we scored our
second try. More strong play from the
forwards enabled scrum-half Dave to
snipe down the blind-side and touch-
down in the corner. Scott then made
the conversion look easy to add the ex-
tras. The score remained the same un-
til half-time, Imperial leading 10-14.
Thus far the game had not been the
easy game that many had anticipated,
and there were some strong words
from Malcolm and Andy MacFadge.
We started the second half keen to
show why we were a league above our
opposition. Imperial started the sec-
ond half in the same way the first half
ended. The phases were all coming to-
gether and the backs were playing with
confidence, skill and most importantly,
penetration. The forwards continued
to provide the quick-ball the backs
needed to make deep inroads into
the tiring Portsmouth team. Angus
and debutant Miles rucked tirelessly
and always got to the breakdown first.
Despite the constant pressure, it took
another ten minutes for the score to
come. A quick switch of direction by
Scott sent the centres driving towards
the line in midfield. From the ruck,
more quick ball enabled Jack Goring
to show his fly-half skills, and start a
sequence of quick hands through the
back line, finishing with Louis diving
over the line for his first IC try. Impe-
rial led 10-19.
Portsmouth struck back straight
away, somehow breaching our defense
to get into the 22. The ref stopped play
at this point because Niall was cry-
ing. “He bit me ref, he bit me”. The ref
looked at Niall, unsure of what to think.
Niall pointed at the opposition: “It was
that one ref, he bit me”. A chuckle or
two later, and play resumed. Imperial
gave away another silly penalty, which
the opposition fly-half easily convert-
ed to bring the score back to 13-19. A
bit of quick-thinking saw Scott sprint
to the half-way line and smack a drop
kick over the recovering opposition,
immediately putting Portsmouth un-
der pressure with a lineout in their own
22. IC again stole the lineout, enabling
Sasha to crash the ball up. The ball was
shipped wide to Benjamin, who true to
his French flair, sold a dummy before
driving over the try-line despite the
best efforts of three tacklers. 13-24.
Now Portsmouth were knackered,
and it was simply a matter of time as to
how many points Imperial could clock.
A scrum in our own half was picked
up by Fresher Dave at number 8, who
sprintedblindsidewithdeceptivespeed
to take us up towards the opposition
22. From the resulting ruck, the ball
was popped to Fresher Rob (who had
just come on for Louie) who decided
the time was right to score a disgust-
ingly good try. Rob collected the ball
from scrum-half Dave, and grubbered
the ball towards the try-line. Rob then
outpaced his opposite man, fly-hacked
the ball over the try-line, collected the
ball and dived over the line. A simply
ridiculous try. 13-29.
Imperial collected the kick-off and
immediately set-up a backs move up
the pitch. A big shout from Mo inside
Scott opened a massive hole through
which Scott duly penetrated. Despite
the double tackle from the opposi-
tion, Scott was able to off-load with
a sublime one-handed backhand pop
to Benjamin who carved through the
opposition. From the following break-
down, the ball was shipped wide to
Rob Thomson who sprinted 50m to
touch the ball down over the line. De-
spite being clean through, Rob con-
tinued the habit of the Imperial team,
who had clearly decided Scott needed
to practice his kicking from out wide.
All bar two tries during the game, eve-
ry try was scored out on the touchline.
Despite missing his previous three at-
tempts, Scott learnt his lesson and ex-
pertly converted from the left touch-
line to make the score 13-36.
With only a few minutes left on the
clock, Imperial still had time for more.
Mo collected a kick over the top from
Portsmouth. The on-rushing tack-
ler received a ridiculous hand-off /
open-palmed punch to the face from
Mo, who then drove Imperial forward
with strength. The backs again set-
off a move which tore Portsmouth to
shreds, bringing us into their 22. A
few forward rumbles later, Scott found
himself with the ball just infront of the
try-line. Some quick feet opened space
for Scott to play scrum-half Dave in
for his second try of the game, wide
on the right touchline. The extras were
missed, and the game came to close
after an emphatic (in the end) victory,
with the final score reading 13-41 to
Imperial. Kingston 1st XV await in the
next round for what will prove a much
tougher test.
The trip home was fantastic. A team-
wide game of Edward Ciderhands emp-
tied all commuters out of our carriage
and enabled some prime team-bond-
ing time. An all round great day, which
saw Imperial 2nd XV notch their third
victory on the bounce. Bring on Kent
next week!

Sasha ‘the Basha’ is forever alert to capitalise on the mistake from the Portsmouth flanker.
‘Reach for the stars’. The song Chilli was certainly thinking of here.
