felix scoops top
prize at student
media awards
This year’s Guardian Student Media
Awards were certainly eventful, espe-
cially for the members of the felix team.
The nominations for the awards were
released at the start of term, where it
was revealed that felix was nominated
for the coveted student newspaper of
the year category, which was won two
years ago under Rupert Neate. I, sci-
ence, the science magazine of Imperial
College and a sister publication of felix
was nominated for the magazine of the
year award, whilst everyone’s favourite
Angry Geek was nominated for the
columnist of the year award.
This year’s awards ceremony, held
on the 26th November in Shoreditch
Town Hall, certainly had the cream of
the crop, with 800 entries being whit-
tled down to 5 per category. After
enjoying the free champagne, cana-
pés and the obligatory chit chat with
the other students, it was time for the
awards to begin.
The competition in each category
was strong, all of the Imperial entries
facing stiff competition, with felix be-
ing up against Nouse from the Univer-
sity of York and Varsity from the Uni-
versity of Cambridge. However, before
the winner of this category was an-
nounced, it was first the turn of Live! in
the student website of the year award,
which they won last year. Unfortunate-
ly Live! was unable to make it two in a
row and the title was passed on to cher-
well.org, University of Oxford.
Once the winners had left the stage,
it was then time to find out who would
be named columnist of the year. Al-
though Angry Geek didn’t win the
award, he did come runner-up, with
the judges saying that “he was clearly
capable of showing a little bit more
than just sheer anger.” For obvious rea-
sons Angry Geek himself wasn’t there
to collect the award, instead a member
of the felix team went to collect it on
his behalf.
Next it was the turn to find out what
the judges had to say about I, science.
Again, there was stiff competition in
this category as all the other publica-
tions were multi-category magazines.
However, it was I, science’s ability to
“engage an audience who would not
normally be interested in science”
that really impressed the judges, and
as a result was awarded the runner-up
position in the magazine of the year
category.
The eventual winners were Quench
from Cardiff University who were so
overcome by the award that one of
their members fell over, although that
could have something to do with the
free champagne available earlier in the
night.
After the members of the Quench
team had left the stage, it was time for
the grande finalé and the naming of the
student newspaper of the year. Nerves
were slightly settled after Nouse from
the University of York, who were
tipped by some as favourites, were
named runners-up. With the Nouse
team settling back in their seats, it was
time to hear what the judges had to
say about the winning entry, with this
year’s award going to felix.
The judges, who included Guard-
ian editor Alan Rusbridger, com-
mented that felix managed to “clearly
engage its audience, with well thought
out news pieces and a quirky sense of
humour that made it stand out above

the rest”. As the result was announced
there was a massive sense of excite-
ment and sheer joy, with the members
of last year’s felix team rushing onto
the stage to collect their prize. Tom
Roberts, last year’s editor in chief, was
so stunned that he didn’t even realise
that the award was being handed to
him, as seen in the picture on the op-
posite page.
The felix team barely had time to sit
down and celebrate their award, when
the final winner of the awards ceremo-
ny was announced. The student jour-
nalist of the year is considered the top
prize for an individual, with this year’s
award being given to felix’s very own
Tom Roberts. Mr Roberts has also won
a seven week long placement with the
Guardian, which he intends to do over
the summer.
Clearly felix, its contributors and
sister publications have very big shoes
to fill this year, something which they
are definitely planning on doing in the
hope of a similar result next year.
Being the best of the best
I
t’s the morning after last night’s
Guardian Student Media
Awards ceremony, and trium-
phant ex-Editor Tom Roberts
comes down to the felix office to
gives us his views on the past, present
and future for felix and himself.
Were you shocked and surprised
by last nights results?
I’m incredibly shocked we won. I
thought we were going to get columnist
and magazine but not the newspaper
one, maybe I’m just being a pessimist.
And then for me to get the student
journalist was even more shocking be-
cause I wasn’t even nominated in any
of the categories.
You clearly must have done
something right with the paper
for them to notice you. Has it
sunk in yet?
Not really, and I’m not sure when it
will. Probably when I start the intern-
ship it’ll sink in, but I mean I’m at a
science college, I shouldn’t be winning
this.
Did you have journalistic ambi-
tions before you started felix and
has this award spurred you on to
continue professionally?
I did have ambitions. Yes I’m doing a
physics degree but I love English. I love
reading, I did English literature at A-
Level and I wanted to keep my writing
skillsgoing.AndIenjoywritingforpeo-
ple, to entertain them so when I started
a TV Editor it gave me the chance to do
all that and flex my writing muscles so
to speak. As I’ve worked my way up the
ladder, I slowly realised that I wanted
to this. The first day I walked through
the felix door to ask Rupert Neate to
work on TV, I knew I wanted to be the
editor for some reason, that was a re-
ally eerie feeling. I didn’t want to do it
straight after my first year, so I waited
a year and was made Deputy Editor in
my second year.
I had ambitions from the beginning
of how I wanted the paper to look, and
I think I achieved that, but I don’t think
you would ever believe that you could
win the awards.
I don’t think I will ever forget felix,
especially not now. It’s been such a
large part of my university life, how
can you?
How did you rate yourself against
the other papers that were in the
newspaper of the year category?
I can’t remember most of them right
now. We get Varsity sent to us every
week, as well as Cherwell every now
and then and we all like reading them.
These are very good newspapers from
good universities that I respect and the
fact that we beat them, especially being
a science college which doesn’t have an
English degree is great.
If anything it’s a testament to you
guys, I mean you’re the volunteers, you
come in spending your spare time to
get the paper done, I’m simply here to
hold you all together. A huge amount
of credit has to go to you guys.
Do you think the culture and the
fact that we are all volunteers do-
ing science degrees that are keen
to write for felix helped at all?
I do. If you look at the photo we took
at the end of the year, the sheer number
of people in there shows how much of
a group we were. That one photo says
it all really, and especially if you look
at the outtakes on facebook you’ll see
us all jumping on each other and just
having a good time.
You’ve taken a bit of a step back
this year in your involvement
with felix to focus on your stud-
ies. One thing you have been
heavily involved with is one of
felix’s magazines, Another Castle.
Can you tell us a little bit more
about that?
Daniel Wan interviews this year’s Guardian Journalist of the
Year and editor in chief of last year’s felix Tom Roberts
Another Castle is the new gam-
ing magazine. Gaming is one of my
main hobbies. I’m a massive geek who
likes playing computer games all day!
We’re producing three this year with
the first one coming out on the 12th
December.
If you’re into computer games and
we have got an interview with Peter
Molyneux who is a big name in British
computing games.
Are you looking for another
award next year then?
Ha, maybe. We’ll have to wait and
see, I don’t want to count my chicks
before they hatch. It would be quite
novel for the Guardian to recognise a
gaming magazine but we’ll have to wait
and see.
How would you compare felix
this year under Jovan, to how
you were doing last year?
Yeah I think he’s taken over the man-
tle well so far. He’s kept the style the
same which I think is good, I was read-
ing the comment section last week and
it is lively as ever, most notably this
Imperial Girl, she’s creating quite a stir.
I think that’s good for the newspaper
even though I do find her a slightly pe-
culiar but there you go! But yeah I think
the paper’s looking good this year.
Rupert Neate’s felix a few years
back also won the same prize, but
they were very different papers.
How do think the judges viewed
the changes in the paper?
It’s interesting because felix changes
a lot each year, for some reason we al-
most have a tradition here that the de-
sign has to change. It’s stayed the same
this year, which I think is a good thing.
In my year of felix I drew upon the
influences from Rupert’s year as well
as Andy Sykes’ year. The news sto-
ries were more investigative, akin to
Rupert’s year, although we maintained
the balance that Andy kept as well as
the quirkiness.
It was quite surreal to see Andrew
Neil say that ‘we like their quirky style
as well as their willingness to take risks,
especially with their front page’. At that
point I think the penny dropped and
we couldn’t believe it.
Your humour was distinctive
last year and it seemed to have
filtered down though the sec-
tion editors as a whole. Do you
think it worked quite well for the
paper?
That was my intention all along
(laugh). I wanted something that you
could take seriously but at the same
time you wouldn’t be mindnumbingly
bored; I mean our news pages have a
section dedicated to LOLCATS on
page 2! I wanted to strike that balance
really because we are students after all,
we have a hectic schedule with lectures
and everything, especially at Imperial,
and if you can’t pick up the paper and
just chat a little bit then it’s not doing
its job. But at the same time it has to be
informative and I think we got it pretty
much right last year.
Well congratulations again
and good luck on your 7 week
placement.
I’ll still be around to pass my wisdom
on, and if you ever want to come for
lunch just let me know.
Wait a minute, those two pieces of glass have our name engraved on it. Oh wait, they’re our Guardian
Student Media Awards for Best Student Newspaper and Student Journalist of the Year. Nice.
If you’ve ordered a bottle of Magners
from the Union bars since the start of
term, you may want to stop reading
here. felix can report this week that
Imperial College Union has knowingly
sold an excess of Magners Irish Cider
that has passed its best before date.
The mass order of 330ml bottles was
made prior to Freshers’ Week for the
special promotion offering a bottle for
£1.50 plus a free half pint plastic glass.
However, the Union obviously over-
estimated the number of bottles they
were able to shift, and left with an ex-
cess of bottles that only sold out this
week.
It is not illegal to sell food or drink
past its ‘best before’ date, as only the
‘use by’ date must be strictly adhered
to. The ‘best before’ date refers to the
period where upon the ‘quality’ of the
product is at its ‘peak’, but not a date of
predicted expiry.
A member of the bar staff, who wish-
es to remain anonymous, disapproved
and was unhappy they were forced to
serve unfresh bottles, which are dated
best before 01/11/08, to unsuspecting
students without notifying them.
When serving two bottles of Magn-
ers to a customer in their original bot-
tles, they were quickly ‘snatched off
the bar’ by another member of staff,
poured into pint glasses, and reserved.
This member of staff in question then
underhandedly told our source of the
situation on a strictly need-to-know
basis, and the bar staff were not openly
told in private prior to serving.
Our source also revealed that in an
attempt to sell off the bottles as quickly
as possible, they were used in Snake-
bites, the popular half-beer/half-cider
drink amongst students. This com-
promise was not communicated to the
students.
Many students have found out in the
past weeks from friends working be-
hind the Union bars, and are annoyed
they were not informed beforehand.
One regular customer described the
Dan Wan
News Correspondent
Out of date Magners sold to
uninformed students
Union’s actions as “substandard”, and
felt that their own Union should be
on their side and not underhandedly
trying to sell them unfresh drinks. An-
other student had noticed the refusal
to sell Magners bottles in their bottles,
but had ‘thought nothing of it.’
felixcontactedMagnersIrishCiderin
Clonmel, Ireland and told that they did
not “condone” the Union’s actions, but
the Union had abided by the law. They
were extremely keen to learn more of
the situation and the circumstances in
which the bottles were bought so close
to their ‘best before’ date. At the time
of print, felix was also unable to get a
comment from the Union regarding
the situation.
Imperial ‘disappointed’ with
the cut in Foundation Year
programme posts
Jovan Nedić
Editor in Chief
Final year medical students are fac-
ing an even harder task of getting jobs
within their own foundation school at
the end of their degree.
Professor Derek Gallen, National
Director of the UK Foundation Pro-
grammeOfficesaid“theUKFPO,under
the direction of the MMC Programme
Board (England), has requested that
each Foundation School in England re-
duces the number of posts they offer
on the online recruitment system by
six. This is because the total number of
applicants has fallen short of the total
number of posts, which means some
posts will be unfilled. The shortfall in
applicants disproportionately affects
the severely under-doctored areas of
England.
The best way to address this shortfall
is to remove a number of posts across
England so that the effect of the short-
fall is minimised. There are enough
posts still available across the UK to
ensure that all eligible applicants who
meet the person specification will be
placed. It is predicted that, based on
the first choice preferences nearly 90%
of applicants will still be allocated to
their first choice foundation school.”
Several of the London Medical
Schools have raised their concerns
over the issue, with Najette Ayadi
O’Donnell, Imperial College School
of Medicine Students’ Union Vice
President (Careers & Alumni) saying
that “Imperial College students are
disappaointed with UKFPO’s recent
announcement regarding the loss of
FY1 prorgammes. We are concerned
with the implications of this loss and
concerned with what this means for us
and our neighhouring London medical
schools. London has the most over sub-
scribed medical schools in the country
and for a reason. One third of all medi-
cal students are at a London medical
school and any FY1 programmes we
can secure are welcomed and wanted
programmes. What we really need to
know now is the impact of this direc-
tive and how many of our students are
now not going to work in the founda-
tion school of their first choice.”
ULU MedGroup, the collaboration
of the five London medical schools,
met yesterday to discuss their response
to the MMC programme board.
This is not the first time that Lon-
don students have felt hard done by
the national application process. Last
year, 62% of Imperial final years were
allocated their first choice post, com-
pared to the 92% UK national average.
Imperial is hoping to see a change in
these results when the allocations are
released on 6th January 2009.
