Should we trust governments with our faces?
“The actions
taken in China
are worthy of
condemnation
and we must
never go down
a similar path”
L
ondon is one of
the world’s most
surveilled cities.
Recently, China
has begun using facial
recognition to keep track
of one of their district’s
Muslim populations.
Ethically speaking, I
believe we can all agree
that, this is one of the
worst uses of modern
technology we have seen
to date. At the beginning
of this year, I have de-
cided to get an iPhone X:
one of its flagship features
was Face ID. It is a great
feature and works flaw-
lessly, allowing me to use
my phone immediately
after raising it up from the
table. However, one might
ask: how are companies
and governments going to
use my data?
Practically speaking
this is quite an easy
question to answer; eth-
ically, not so much. We
can discuss examples of
the uses of facial recog-
nition software and judge
whether they’re right or
wrong. Does the law of
this country, and of all
Azure platform. Microsoft
was one of many sponsors
behind ICHack, providing
a whole suite of solutions
for application develop-
ment – ranging from facial
recognition to judging a
person’s emotions from
their expression. Now this
all sounds great in theory,
and I have nothing against
Microsoft or its platform;
I believe everyone should
have access to great
technology. However,
it’s easy to forget in this
excitement about how
these services can be
manipulated. Almost all
ideas using these services
would work best when we
recorded the user without
their attention; after all it’s
best to see how someone
is feeling without them
posing for a selfie. If you
were on the app-store and
saw an app that would
record you all the time,
would you download it?
Regardless of how much
of an improvement it
would make, would you
say yes? How can you be
sure that the company or
individual behind it won’t
misuse your data?
In a perfect world we
would not have to resort
to tracking every person,
however in this broken
world we might just have
to. A lot of good can come
of it, we can stop terrorist
attacks, burglaries and
violent attacks to name
a few by ensuring the
location of dangerous in-
dividuals are known to the
authorities. Once again
though, we are coming to
a cross-roads where we
must decide if this good
is coming at the cost of
too much of our privacy.
Furthermore, we must
ask ourselves whether
the grainy CCTV pictures
we always see on our TV
are good enough for an
artificial intelligence to
judge whether someone
was there or not. Ulti-
mately, at any point in this
debate, we can not resort
to tracking minorities
and vulnerable groups, as
limiting as it may be to
the scope of the mass-sur-
veillance taking place.
The actions in China are
worthy of condemnation
and we must never go
down a similar path.
One of the greatest
privacy concerns of facial
recognition is that it is
able to collect its data in
just a fraction of a second.
In Russia, this technology
is already at large, with
an app called ‘FindFace’
which allows you to find a
person on Russia’s leading
social media network,
VKontakte. With our
personalities and pictures
increasingly out there, it
will only become easier to
find who we are and what
we are like.
In one way we’re
already giving this power
to our governments. A
lot of people get emo-
tional about privacy, but
no one acts like it’s of
any importance. Surely,
it’s not as easy as: ‘If
you’ve got nothing to
hide you have nothing
to worry about’? This is
definitely something to
think about, especially
as cognitive-enabled
applications are created.
Artificial intelligence is
causing a massive stir-up
in our society, from robots
taking over our jobs, to the
weaponization of it to end
the lives of other human
beings more effectively.

others, allow for the rec-
ognition of the difference
between these right and
wrong cases? As a com-
puting student who enjoys
development in his spare
time, this is a question I
ask myself often – most
recently at ICHack 18,
this year’s edition of
the Imperial College
Hackathon organised by
DoCSoc.
