Imperial College Union bans student elections
HANGMAN
The Union hopes the
move will outrage
students enough that
they actually demand
to vote this year.

I
mperial College
Union have
launched this year’s
leadership elections
by banning all forms of
democratic process.
The move, which came
as a surprise to the few
students who pay atten-
tion to elections, follows
a report commissioned by
the Union earlier this year
on how they can increase
election participation. The
publication – entitled The
Ballot or the Bullet: Why
the best thing we can do
for democracy is destroy
it – argued that student
demand for democracy
would only increase if
elections were banned.
Professor Mark
McGrath, Chair of
European History at the
University of Leicester,
was the lead author of the
study. He told Hangman:
“In putting together the
report, we did a great deal
of research into students.
We found a clear pattern
of behaviour: students
would never use a service
that was on offer, but as
soon as you decided to
withdraw it, they’d all
suddenly start bitching.
We therefore felt that
banning student elections
would mean everyone
would suddenly pay
attention to them”.
Hedwig Grantly, Im-
perial College Union’s
‘Deeper Democracy
Deliverer”, told Hangman
By banning democratic
engagement, we believe
students will suddenly
start demanding the right
to vote.”
“Already this morning
we’ve been inundated
with complaints from
Union Council members,
who say we’re under-
mining the fundamental
principles of student
democracy. Once this
outrage trickles down to
the students at large, and
riots break out in Metric,
we’ll reopen nominations
and watch them flock to
the ballot box.”
The move has already
provoked a fierce reaction
from students. Julius
Putnam, a final year chem-
istry undergraduate, told
Hangman: “I’ve never
really cared about the
Union, and I don’t think
I’ve actually ever voted
in previous elections.
But not they’re trying to
remove something I don’t
even use I’m going to fight
to the death until elections

at this clear trampling of
democratic rights,” she
told Hangman, “we’re
going to use every tool at
our disposal to reverse the
decision. We’ll even start
a change.org petition if we
have to”
Hangman expected the
decision to be welcomed
by members of FashSoc,
but one of their repre-
sentatives told us “for the
last time, we’re fashion
society, not the alt-right.”
Other students seemed
less affected by the de-
cision, however: when
Hangman spoke to stu-
dents in the College Cafe
about the move, who said
“what’s the Union? Is it
the same as the College?”,
“I don’t know what a
DPFS is”, and “please
leave me alone.”
“As Joni
Mitchell
teaches us, you
don’t know
what you’ve
got‘til it’s
gone”

Louise Prufrock,
head of Imperial Labour
Society, called the move
an “outrage for democra-
cy”. “As a student political
group, we are in disbelief

that the move, though
“bold”, would “ensure a
greater participation than
ever”: “If Joni Mitchell
has taught us anything, it’s
that you don’t know what
you’ve got ‘til it’s gone.

The staff members
with the greatest
number of SACAs
nominations will get
to keep their pensions
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
S
taff members
with the most
nominations in
the Student Ac-
ademic Choice Awards
(SACAs) will see their
pensions reinstated, in
the latest development
over staff pensions.
Academic staff up and
down the country are set
to go on strike later this
month and in March,
following disputes about
pension pay. Following
deadlocked talks between
the trade unions and senior
College management last
week, Imperial College
Union have been working
with the College to try and
come up with a solution.
Earlier this week,
Kyle Fandergoose, Vice
Provost (Scab Employ-
ment), announced the
changes. In an email sent
out to all Imperial staff,
Fandergoose said that
the changes were “a fair
solution to the drawn out
negotiations”. He told
Hangman: “at Imperial,
we pride ourselves on
world-class research and
cutting edge technological
developments. However,
as a staff member pointed
out to me the other day,
we’ve also got students
who need teaching. I don’t
know if this is a new thing
or not… nevertheless,
this new method means
that some staff will get to
keep their pensions, while
those who students don’t
like or know will bear the
brunt of costs. It seems
very fair.”
Neil Babcock, the
Union’s Deputy Presi-
dent (Edutainment), told
Hangman “for the past
half-decade we’ve been
giving out our famous
mugs to those who are
nominated for SACAs –
so well known now that
they’re almost an Impe-
rial institution. This year,
however, we wanted to
do a bit more to recognise
our wonderful staff – as
well as a mug, those who
receive the most nomina-
tions will also have the
added benefit of a sense of
financial security post-re-
tirement.”
One staff member was
unhappy with the changes,
telling Hangman: “it’s bad
enough that I have to deal
with students complaining
about their late feedback
and unclear marking guid-
ance, but now I have to
be actively nice to them?
Screw that.” Other reac-
tions ranged from “stu-
dents, what students?” to
“wait, I’ve been supposed
to be teaching?”
Some staff seemed
happy with the changes,
however. Dr Jess Syntess,
from the Department of
Materials, told Hangman:
“these changes make
perfect sense. It’s about
time we recognised how
central teaching is to our
roles, and how much
we enjoy spending time
with our students. I really
value all my wonderful
students, and hope they’re
reading this. If any of
them wanted to make a
SACAs nomination for
me, it only take a couple
of minutes. Please. I’m
only a few months away
from retirement. Please. I
need this.”

This week a DMC after
ACC night leads you to
make some fascinating
insights about how you
can finally take control of
your own life. You then
pass out and forget them.
This week you achieve
peace in the Middle East,
all through a Facebook
live debate you organised
that was watched by 30
people. That’s all they
were waiting for.
This week the last shred
of enthusiasm you had
for 2018 has finally faded
away. Welcome to reality.
This week you’re upset
that foosball wasn’t
picked to be the headliner
at Varsity. There’s always
next year I guess.

This week you steal the

This week you’re RON,

This week you’re the

you’ve only managed

This week you take a leaf

crushing mediocrity with

This week the lunar

hold. Perhaps put off
asking for that promotion.
