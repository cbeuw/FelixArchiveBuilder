The strike is the latest in the dispute over pensions // flickr/dun.can
Imperial among 61 universities to face strike action
over pensions in coming months

finally conceded they
could pay increased
contributions in order
to fund the continuation
of defined benefit USS
of the situation”.
A spokesperson for
Imperial College Union,
which is not affiliated
with the NUS, told Felix:
“Imperial College Union
will soon meet Imperial
UCU to discuss their view
on the strikes. We will
also ask Imperial UCU
and College to let us know
what impact they believe
the strikes will have on
our students, so we can
keep you as informed
as possible of how your
studies may be affected.”
UCU will be offer-
ing strike pay to their
members, saying they will
“look to prioritise help for
those most in need”.
The UCU has recently
produced a video ex-
plaining the rationale
behind the strikes to
students, which claims
a typical lecturer would
lose £10,000 per year in
retirement benefits. They
say “without the security
of a decent pension, staff
will simply leave”.
“Imperial
UCU said the
refusal to fund
the pension
scheme was
'another
disappointing
indication
of the value
amnagement
place on staff'”

What we mean when we talk
about democracy
C
rikey! That’s
come around
quickly. It
seems like only
a few months ago that
we were all gearing up
for last year’s Leadership
Elections, and here we
are already with a whole
new set. Well, when I
say we were all gearing
up… more like those
who were running and
assorted Union hacks, but
when you’re running a
campaign it can be hard to
see anything outside of it.
Imperial College Union
regularly prides itself
on having ‘the biggest
student democracy in the
country’, but what does
that really mean? Is there
any way you can really
measureavalueasabstract
as democracy? The Union
has traditionally done so
by looking at metrics like
the number of candidates
running, and the turnout
at elections, with com-
pleting an online ballot
standing in as a proxy for
democratic engagement.
And, to be sure, having
people turn up to the polls
is a hugely vital part of
any democratic process –
just look at what happened
with the general election
last year, where high youth
turnout swung a number
of constituencies, not
least our own Kensing-
ton constituency, which
turned to Labour despite
all odds. But democracy
is not a coat you can shrug
on and off as you feel like
it; it’s a living, breathing
being that needs continual
renewal and engagement.
If I seem to be in a bit
of a pensive mood, that’s
because this election
marks something of a
turning point in my year
as Felix Editor: all the
sabbatical officers are
now about six months into
the job, and soon we’ll
know who’ll be taking
our places (don’t worry,
there’s no chance I’ll be
running again). The time
for us to make change is
quickly running out, and
we all need to think hard
about what we’re going to
do as we serve the remain-
der of our year.
It’s with this in mind
that I turn to the Union
itself. While nominations
are open from this week,
they don’t close until
the end of February, so
we have an entire month
before the big election
roadshow is kicked off.
It’s more than enough
time to sit back, reflect,
and ponder on the state of
the Union. What has been
done well? What should
we focus on for next year?
Or should we just scrap
the whole damn system
and start again? These are
the kind of questions Felix
will be examining over
the next few weeks.
I know some of you
might find all this talk of
Union politics awfully
dull – you just want to
skip through to the cen-
trefold (two this week!),
Hangman, and the puzzles
section. It’s cool, I get you.
But if you’ve had enough
of pontificating about the
nature of democracy, I
have one suggestion: run
for Felix Editor yourself.

What is the debate about?
The debate centres around proposed
changes to pension schemes for university
staff. The current pension scheme used
in higher education is the University
Superannuation Scheme (USS) – a defined
benefit pensions scheme in which the
employer is responsible for contributions
up to a salary of £55,550. Beyond this, the
USS switches to a defined contribution
scheme, where pension value is linked to the
performance of the stock market.
UUK proposes to end the defined benefit
scheme and switch to a fully defined
contribution scheme – a move UCU general
secretary Sally Hunt called “the worst
proposal I have received in twenty years of
representing university staff”. Alistair Jarvis,
the chief executive of UUK, has said the
changes are necessary to“ensure the scheme
remains sustainable.” Sam Gyimah, the new
universities minister, however, last month
wrotetoEllieReesMPsayingtheUSSpension
scheme was“strong and stable”.
Dr Michael McGarvey, President of
Imperial College UCU, told Felix:“Depending
on calculations – which are highly contested
– the increased contributions required to
fund the defined benefit USS pensions might
be very little, or – at the very most – 10% of
Imperial’s annual operating surplus”
There are concerns this could leave
pension funds at the mercy of fluctuations
of the stock market in the future. Last year
Professor Michael Otsuka, of the London
School of Economics, estimated for some
staffswitchingtothenewschemewouldlead
to a reduction in the value of their pension
of 60%. An Imperial working group, which
was commissioned by College management,
produced a critique of the basis upon which
UUK is recommending changes, saying “lack
of transparency remains a key issue” in the
debate.
disruption to their edu-
cation, and we will work
with departments and the
students’ union to discuss
and implement mitigation
plans. We hope to keep
disruption to a minimum.”
The National Union of
Students (NUS) this week
issued a joint statement
with UCU, saying they
were “sister organisations
committed to promot-
ing the interests of our
members and defending
education”. The unions
said they were “proud
of our work together in
calling for a better deal for
students and staff”, and the
NUS asked its members
to “continue to call for the
university employers to
recognise the seriousness
pensions, but have chosen
not to.
“At a time when real
pay has fallen by around
20% since 2009 and staff
facilities are being with-
drawn (the latest being
the swimming pool at the
St. Mary’s Campus), this
is another disappointing
indication of the value
management place on
staff at Imperial.”
A College spokesper-
son informed Felix that
UCU notified them of 522
members at Imperial, of
whom 276 are academic
staff, 102 are research
staff, and the remainder
are postgraduate stu-
dents, or administrative
and managerial staff. A
College spokesperson
said they were “disap-
pointed” by the industrial
action, telling Felix: “We
appreciate students may
have concerns about
