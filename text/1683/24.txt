On Directing Film
A politically-charged Best Director race influenced by a younger voting pool has made us question what it really
means to direct a film.
T
he announcement
of the Academy
Award nomina-
tions last week
saw the usual surprises
and snubs roll in. One
particular category has
continued to be the source
of much debate through-
out awards season, with
commentators and voters
alike unable to come to
agreement. Across the
Golden Globes, BAFTAs,
and Academy Awards
this year we have had ten
different people nomi-
nated for Best Director,
an unprecedented total,
and a somewhat welcome
change from seeing
the same five directors
compete from January
to March. In the end we
wound up with four first
time nominees, including
two making their direc-
torial debuts, joined by a
man who has been widely
lauded as our greatest
working director.
There has been
mounting pressure on the
Academy in recent years
to reward a more diverse
range of performers and
artists. Suggestions that
the largely older, white,
male voting pool lean
towards voting for films
made by their peers have
caused the Academy
to take measures to
drastically alter the de-
mographics of its voters,
increasing the number
of women and ethnic
minorities, and lowering
the average age. 683 new
members were invited to
join the Academy in 2016.
Prior to this, the voting
membership was by the
Academy’s own count
94% white and 76% male.
After, it is 89% white and
73% male. While still a
far cry from equality, the
shake-up was a step in the
right direction. This has
undoubtedly influenced
this year’s nominations,
with older stalwarts
Ridley Scott and Steven
Spielberg – who received
Golden Globe nods – shut
out for the younger Greta
Gerwig and Jordan Peele,
both making films from
perspectives that are not
seen nearly enough on the
big screen. There is still
a huge amount of work
that needs to be done to
ensure that studios, pro-
duction companies, and
independent financiers
invest more in women
and ethnic minority film-
makers (only 11% of films
in 2017 were directed by
women, a figure that has
not increased since 2000),
but this is a start.
Call me old-fashioned
though, but I for one
would like to see the
actual five best directorial
efforts of the past year
be nominated in the
five Best Director slots.
Crazy thought: maybe the
category should do what it
says on the tin. Of course,
the Academy is allergic to
lower budget, avant garde
fair, and has consistently
displayed a quality akin
to xenophobia in its un-
swerving exclusion of for-
eign-language directors
from the race. The likes
of Sean Baker and Shane
Carruth will likely never
come close to Academy
recognition, nor David
Lowery for last year’s as-
tonishing A Ghost Story;
meanwhile, the Michel
Hazanavicius’s and
Michael Hanekes of this
world come once in a blue
moon. Even if we accept
these limitations, the
inclusion of Gerwig and
Peele is still somewhat
contentious. Were they
really part of the best five
English-language main-
stream film directors last
year?
Toanswerthatquestion,
we need to really think
about what it means to
direct a film. At a basic
level, we can go with
David Mamet’s definition:
the director has two main
duties – to know where
to put the camera, and to
communicate with the
actors. This is rudimenta-
ry, and does not encom-
pass the auteur theory of
cinema, of which each of
this year’s five nominees
is an exponent, with all
of them serving as writ-
er-director-producers (bar
Gerwig, who is merely a
writer-director). However,
to assess this year’s can-
didates for arguably the
most prestigious prize in
cinema, let us go along
with Mamet’s ideology.
First up, Guillermo Del
Toro. Though never nom-
inated for Best Director
before, he won the Golden
Globe and Critics Choice
Award, and is widely
expected to follow this
up with victories at the
BAFTAs and Oscars. Del
Toro’s career has largely
been focused on stories
about mythical beasts,
and he has a knack for
tying in these narratives
with important periods in
history. On this occasion
he weaves a romance
between a mute janitor
and a merman-like
aquatic creature from the
Amazon with the mascu-
line toxicity of the Cold
War. Del Toro’s work is
jaw-dropping, particularly
the beautiful underwater
shots and a wonderful
black and white musical
segment that harks back
to the Classic Hollywood
era. There is more than
a little Douglas Sirk in
this picture, and Sally
Hawkins’ is mesmeric in
the lead, ably supported
by Octavia Spencer,
Richard Jenkins, Michael
Shannon, Michael
Stuhlbarg, and Doug
Jones in heavy suiting
and make-up. Does he
know where to put the
camera? Check. Does he
get great performances
out of his actors? Check.
If as expected Del Toro is
victorious, he will be the
fourth Mexican winner
in the past five years.
Other directors would be

ago.
giving two of the best
performances of the
year. In that respect she
certainly fulfils her duty
as a director assuredly. On
the other hand, one has to
question whether her task
in directing Lady Bird
was really as difficult as
the grand scale of Denis
Villeneuve’s triumph
with Blade Runner 2049,
or whether her choice of
shots had anywhere near
the subtext of Luca Gua-
dagnino’s sensual Call Me
by Your Name. Gerwig
passes the test with Lady
Bird, but her test is like
Key Stage 1 mathematics
compared to the Universi-
ty level work Villeneuve
and Guadagnino have
attempted and pulled off.
There is no doubt that
Gerwig is riding a wave
of momentum with the
#MeToo and Time’s Up
movements. It is insensi-
tive to compare the sup-
pression of female direc-
tors to the sexual violence
against women that has
led to these uprisings, and
yet that is exactly what
has happened. Society
is rightly demanding
women be treated fairly
and equally in all aspects
of life, but this may have
pushed Gerwig into a
position she does not
necessarily deserve over
others. The strength of
her film is in the honesty
of its script, and while her
direction is adequate, it is
not comparable to some of
the others who have been
left out.
Get Out was a gargan-
tuan financial hit. Jordan
Peele’s social commen-
tary certainly seemed to
align with the current zeit-
geist, and while initially
well reviewed – but not
acclaimed to the extent
of the likes of Dunkirk,
Call Me by Your Name,
The Florida Project, or
Phantom Thread – it has
since gone on to top more
year end lists than any
other film. Peele draws
decent performances from
young talents like Daniel
Kaluuya, Lakeith Stan-
field, and Caleb Landry
Jones, and the always ex-
cellent Catherine Keener
and Bradley Whitford.
However, Allison
Williams is simply dire,
and Lil Rel Howery’s
moments are jarring, and
not in a good way. This
is surely Peele casting a
throwback to his sketch
show acting days, and not
a particularly welcome
one. Comparison with
The Killing of a Sacred
Deer is useful, as Yorgos
Lanthimos’ ability to
create suspense through
motivated and careful
camera movement and a
staccato score is far more
effective than anything
Peele is able to conjure
up, evidencing Peele’s
directorial shortcomings.
Peele’s concept, particu-
larly that of the sunken
place, is insightful, but
again, like Gerwig, one
cannot help but feel that
the strength of this film
is in the script (which
arguably comes loose in
the third act anyway) and
not in the direction. Still,
Peele becomes only the
fifth black person nomi-
nated for Best Director,
following recent nomi-
nations for Barry Jenkins
and Steve McQueen. One
would be hard pressed
to find anyone that con-
siders Peele’s directorial
achievements on a par
with the elegiac lyricism
of Jenkins or the gritty ex-
pressionism of McQueen.
Steven Spielberg.
James Cameron. Quentin
Tarantino. There are but
a handful of directors
who have been able to
transform themselves into
a brand, but Christopher
Nolan can surely count
himself in this elite
company. Considering the
popularity of the likes of
Inception and The Dark
Knight, it will have been
of surprise to many to
learn that Dunkirk was in
fact Nolan’s first Oscar
nomination for Best
Director. In reality, this
is the first time Nolan has
really deserved it. Dunkirk
is his best film, playing to
his strengths while cutting
out his tortured leading
men with dying wives and
cringe-worthy dialogue.
Nolan has stripped down
cinema to its foundations
– sight and sound – and
pushed those elements to
the limit. Dunkirk does
falter in the sense that
the emotional beats, such
as the death of Barry Ke-
oghan’s young volunteer
George Mills and the
capture of Tom Hardy’s
spitfire pilot Farrier, do
not truly resonate. Un-
deniably though, Nolan
delivered cinema in its
purest form, and deserved
his nod for Best Director.
Bergman, Scorsese, and
Kubrick, superb scores,
beautiful cinematography,
richly unique characters,
and tremendous acting
performances are all
hallmarks of Anderson’s
work, particularly as he
has matured and moved
into a more refined
and less wild mode of
filmmaking. Perhaps the
three greatest male acting
performances of the
century came in Anderson
films – Daniel Day-Lewis
in There Will Be Blood
and Joaquin Phoenix and
Phillip Seymour Hoffman
in The Master. This high-
lights his extraordinary
abilities as a director, and,
alongside his sumptuous-
ly framed shots (which
he composed entirely on
his own this time round,
serving as his own cine-
matographer), showcase
him as the finest film-
maker of his generation.
Phantom Thread is not
another step on the ladder
to greatness for Paul
Thomas Anderson; he has
already long resided in the
pantheon of the greats.
It may be controversial
to suggest that Gerwig and
Peele have received their
nominations on the basis
of politics, but it certainly
seems to be the case that
their inclusion has been
driven by the desire to
include more women and
ethnic minorities, espe-
cially when their work is
stacked up against that of
Del Toro, Anderson and
Nolan. Their nominations
have certainly caused
debate, and prompted
questions on how we
should judge the quality
of directing. At this year’s
Oscars, many of the Best
Picture nominees will also
be competing in other cat-
egories. Were films akin to
mathematical equations,
once one removes the
acting, writing, and tech-
nical elements of the film,
then Best Picture should
equal Best Director. Sadly
that is not the case, and
it is incredibly hard to
separate the director from
the rest of the production,
more so than any other
category. Filmmaking is
the most collaborative of
processes, and the lines
between individual disci-
plines are so often blurred.
It is the director’s job to
bring all these elements
together into a cohesive
vision. When they all do
come together it can yield
spectacular results. That
is what good directing
is, and that is what good
filmmaking is.

Greta Gerwig is one of
the most versatile actors
of her generation, and has
shown herself to be a dab
hand as a writer, co-pen-
ning Frances Ha and
Mistress America. Last
year she was given the
opportunity to step into
the director’s chair for the
first time. Her film, while
not including any actual
events from Gerwig’s life,
“has a core truth that res-
onates with what I know”,
to use her own words. The
aesthetic, in the costumes
and the production design,
are extremely true to the
early noughties. Gerwig
told her cinematographer
Sam Levy that she wanted
the end product to feel
like a memory, and they
have gone some way to
achieving this. Gerwig’s
shot selection is simple,
but serviceable, and she
has undeniably used her
own experience as an
actor to aid Saoirse Ronan
and Laurie Metcalf in

While the younger,
more diverse voting
pool has been credited
for Gerwig and Peele’s
nominations, what many
commentators did not
count on is that the likes
of Anderson and Nolan,
who are idolised by young
filmmakers, would benefit
too.Aman who has earned
