Last Flag Flying: Linklater’s latest
Fred Fyles dives deep into Linklater’s wisecrack fueled road trip drama, starring Steve Carell, Bryan Cranston, and
Laurence Fishburne, and does not like what he finds...
I
f looking back
teaches us one thing,
it is that the past is a
strange and foreign
land. If we are to ascribe
to the films of Richard
Linklater a mission state-
ment, however, it would
be to make that land fa-
miliar. Or rather, familiar
enough.
Linklater is a director
who trades in nostalgia,
an emotion generated by
images and objects that
are tantalisingly familiar,
and yet achingly inacces-
sible. From capturing the
memories that will later be
tinted with a rose-colour-
ed nostalgia – as in Before
Sunrise, or Everybody
Wants Some! – or having
characters watch events
play out and turn into
memories before their
very eyes – as in Patricia
Arquette’s matriarch in
Boyhood – Linklater is
at his most comfortable
when bringing the past
within touching distance
of an audience.
In theory, then, Last
Flag Flying, his sequel
to Hal Ashby’s 1973 film
The Last Detail, should
see him on home territory.
We follow three Vietnam
veterans, reuniting in the
near past of 2003, and re-
flecting on the experienc-
es that shaped them thirty
years before, thus gener-
ating a form of memory
that is twice-removed
from the viewer. With
the audience re-engaging
“With Last
Flag Flying,
Linklater is
too concerned
with wallowing
in the past,
rather than
reflecting on
it”
“As usual,
Linklater
delivers
punchy
dialogue, with
the cracks
coming thick
and fast”
with their experiences of
nearly 15 years ago, and
the characters reaching
further back into decades
gone by, Linklater is on
familiar territory. What
a pity, then, that the film
remains little more than
a by-the-numbers affair,
which quickly becomes
sentimental, losing any
political clout in a maudlin
sensibility.
Steve Carell plays
‘Doc’,whowascourt-mar-
tialed and imprisoned as a
young man serving in the
military. Now, thirty years
later, an America still
reeling from the shock
of 9/11 has embarked on
another seemingly-point-
less war, which has
resulted in Doc’s son’s
death in Baghdad. With
the narrative thrust justly
provided, Doc seeks out
his old marine buddies
– Sal (Bryan Cranston)
and Mueller (Laurence
Fishburne) – to help him
escort his son’s body back
home.
Naturally this is easier
said than done, and – amid
some terse conversations
with Colonel Willetts,
an anaemic attempt at
an antagonist played by
Yul Vazquez – the men
are forced to take the
train through the Eastern
states, accompanying the
young man’s body. Lo and
behold – another buddy
movie.
As usual, Linklater
delivers punchy dialogue,
with the cracks coming
thick and fast, but there
is a sense that he is aban-
doning the naturalistic
approach he took with
Boyhood for a more
contrived script. The
three characters have
clearly-defined roles
within the narrative:
Carell’s performance is
the most impressive, with
a willfully-restrained
embodiment of Doc,
who stands quietly at the
periphery of most scenes.
It’s a welcome contrast
to Cranston, who ratchets
up his wise-cracking
boozehound to the n-th
degree, until Sal is little
more than a caricature
of what war does to the
individual. Linklater
indulges this character far
too much, and it quickly
becomes tiresome. Fish-
burne delivers his lines
with his usual gravitas
– fitting since Mueller
has reformed since his
old days, and is now an
ordained minister – but
there is little out of the
ordinary in his perfor-
mance.
Where the film really
disappoints, however, is
in its attempts to form a
critique of the political
environment of the ear-
ly-noughties, in particular
American foreign policy.
The action occurs against
the backdrop of Saddam
Hussein’s capture, less
than a year into a war
in Iraq that would leave
hundreds of thousands
dead. Characters begin
to make motions towards
criticism of the state,
but Linklater always has
them pull back, segueing
instead to discussions
about Eminem or the
rapidly-developing cell
phone technology.
It has been more than
14 years since the begin-
ning of the Iraq War, and
16 years since September
11th – we are now further
away from that point in
time than the characters
in the film are from the
fall of the Berlin Wall. It’s
more than enough time
for a director to take on
the challenge of critical
reflection, to engage with
our own recent past, but
sadly Linklater fails to
deliver. His characters
always stop short of
saying anything outright,
and – as a result – they
don’t say anything at all.
With Last Flag Flying, he
is too concerned with wal-
lowing in the past, rather
than reflecting on it.
