n the days following
the successful appeal
by the General
Medical Council
(GMC) to have Dr Hadiza
Bawa-Garba struck off the
medical register, meaning
she is not able to return to
practice for at least five
years, a crowd-funding
campaign has raised over
£200, 000 to fund further
legal counsel for the
paediatrician. The money
will be used to pay for in-
dependent legal review of
the ruling and potentially
a legal challenge to the
High Court decision, as
well as the original ruling
of manslaughter by gross
negligence.
The swell of support
from doctors across the
UK was triggered by
concerns over patient
safety following the ruling
and perceived scapegoat-
ing by Dr Bawa-Garba’s
trust and the GMC to
cover up systemic failings
in the run up to the tragic
death of six-year-old Jack
Adcock in February 2011.
These concerns were
shared by health secretary
Jeremy Hunt, who tweeted
that he was “deeply con-
cerned” by the potential
implications of the ruling.
Worries were voiced by
Hunt and doctors over the
damage done to transpar-
ency in medical education
following the use of Dr
Bawa-Garba’s portfolio
reflections in the trial,
which were submitted by
her defence. Thousands
of doctors have penned
a letter warning of the
potential consequences,
such as more defensive
medicine and less ex-
pressive reflection, which
could contribute to similar
mistakes in the future
and subsequent harm to
patients.
Jack Adcock was
admitted to the Leicester
Royal Infirmary Hospital
at around 10:30am after
being sent there by his
GP. He presented with
dehydration secondary to
vomiting and diarrhoea,
shallow breathing, and
blue lips. When admitted
he was unresponsive and
limp. Initially treated with
fluids and oxygen, after
a chest x-ray revealed
pneumonia, he was
prescribed antibiotics.
Jack seemed to recover
initially, but at 7.45pm he
went into cardiac arrest as
a complication of sepsis,
which had been missed by
the medical team. Around
an hour previously, he
had been given an unpre-
scribed dose of enalapril,
a regular medication he
was prescribed following
heart surgery in early life.
Jack died 90 minutes later,
after resuscitation failed
to revive him.
The original ruling of
gross negligence man-
slaughter is grounded
on the failings of Dr
Bawa-Garba having
hastened the death of
Jack. Several mistakes
were made, which were
given in the evidence of
Dr Cadel, expert witness
of the prosecution and
were admitted by Dr Ba-
wa-Garba herself. These
included missing signs
of sepsis on admission,
failing to ask for consult-
ant review by phone or in
handover at 4.30pm, and a
three hour delay in reading
the chest radiograph.
Several key mitigating
factors were found to
have contributed to the
day’s events by an internal
trust report, yet were not
included in the original
trial. The extent of their
contribution was such
that the report concluded
that no single cause for
the death was able to be
identified. These were
outlined in an account
written by several con-
sultant paediatricians in
support of Dr Bawa-Gar-
ba. They included the fact
that she was doing the
work of three doctors that
day, as her consultant and
the other registrar were
away on leave. Due to IT
failure, her House Officer
was having to phone for
results in the afternoon,
making them unable to
assist in care. In addition,
the agency nurse caring
for Jack was not trained in
paediatrics.
Despite all of this,
Justice Ouseley, of the
GMC appeal, ruled that
these conditions were not
“something she had not
been trained to cope with
or was something wholly
out of the ordinary for
a year 6 trainee”. This
speaks volumes about the
current state of the NHS,
that a trainee working
without supervision is
expected to do the job
of three doctors without
making any mistakes.
Hence, empathy for Dr
Bawa-Garba is strong,
with the hashtag #wea-
reallhadiza cropping up
on Twitter. Many doctors
have experienced similar
working conditions in
their careers, especially
in recent years within
a buckling, chronically
underfunded NHS. Dr
Wilmshurst, Consultant
Cardiologist at Royal
Stoke University Hospital
has asked the GMC to
investigate his 40 years of
clinicalpractice,admitting
to clinical errors leading
to delayed diagnosis and
treatment. Writing to the
BMJ, he stated “it is clear
that the High Court agreed
with the GMC that honest
errors should be career
ending mistakes”.
The tremors from the
case have reached medical
students here at Imperial,
who fear what the decision
of the GMC means for
their training. One student
commented that they are
“terrified” that doctors are
expected to cope without
adequate resources and
not only do one job, but
that of two other doctors.
Another said that they are
“hesitant” to engage with
the reflective process for
learning purposes if it
can be used as evidence
against them. Perhaps
most worrying is the
GMC’s move to strike Dr
Bawa-Garba off, despite
the previous ruling of
the Medical Practitioners
Tribunal to suspend her
for 12 months. Suppos-
edly this was done in the
public interest, to restore
confidence in the profes-
sion. To many, however,
the decision seems to be an
act of political and public
appeasement, and will do
nothing to prevent similar
deaths in the future.
