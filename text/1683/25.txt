T
his is one of those
books that one
can discuss at
length and would
make a good choice for a
book club, but I’ll try to
keep it short though I have
much to say.
The story is told from
the first person perspec-
tive of Michael Berg and
begins with him having
contracted hepatitis at
the age of fifteen. After
vomiting on the sidewalk
he is helped by a woman,
Frau Hanna Schmitz, in
her thirties. Once he has
recovered, he decides to
thank her for her help.
What began as a gesture
of gratitude, with dubious
intentions, led to a love
affair between the two.
After a few months
into this affair, Schmitz
inexplicably leaves town
and Michael, leaving him
to question their rela-
tionship and whether she
ever shared his feelings
for her. Fast forward a
few years and Michael, a
student studying Law at
university, joins a Profes-
sor’s seminar dealing with
the trials of people with
links to the Nazi regime,
whether facilitating it in
the form of prison guards
at concentration camps or
turning a blind eye to it.
Observing one of these
trials, Michael recognises
one of the defendants:
Hanna Schmitz.
He becomes engrossed
with this trial, never
missing a day. He starts
to feel numb towards her,
condemning her actions
with all of his being, only
to recant those condem-
nations when reminiscing
about their relationship.
He finds himself in the
turmoil of trying to come
to terms with his coun-
try’s recent history which
seems to clash directly
with his own adolescence.
This novel explores
a range of issues and
handles them extremely
well given its relatively
short length. The writing
is stark, bare of any
superfluous descriptions,
enabling the reader to
assume a position of
detachedness from the
characters.
This, I believe, allowed
me to objectively judge
the characters and the
situations they were
involved in without the
author invoking those
judgements through
in-depth descriptions of
the characters’ thoughts
and feelings. It permits
the reader to arrive at their
own conclusions without
being nudged there by the
author, which is some-
thing I really appreciated
given the topics that were
dealt with.
It would have been so
easy for the author to make
Michael condemn and
disown his own memories
of Hanna once he realises
the atrocities she has
committed, a position that
many people would sym-
pathise with. Yet he delib-
erately allows Michael to
return to those memories
“The novel
does not shirk
away from
deconstructing
how guilt
is handed
around and
shared”
“Schlink also
deals with how
a country tries
to reconcile
with its recent
past, in an
effort to heal
itself”
to question Hanna’s guilt
and whether she deserves
his denouncement.
Schlink also deals with
how a country tries to
reconcile and confront its
recent past, in an effort
to heal itself. How easy
it is for the generation
that came into adulthood
after the end of the war to
condemn and judge those
they perceived to have
been complicit, almost to
the point of making them
feel good, a prototype of
what we term political
correctness today.
While some un-
doubtedly deserve those
condemnations, whether
those who kept silent do is
a different matter. ‘What
would you have done?’ - a
question Hanna puts to
the judge during her trial
is one this new generation
has not contemplated
carefully in their frenzy
to assume a higher moral
ground, but is one which
Michael grapples with.
Whether he would have,
were it not for his personal
involvement with one
of those defendants, is a
question left to the reader,
and one I would have to
answer with a resounding
no.
The novel has been crit-
icised for trying to invoke
sympathy to Nazi crimi-
nals, questioning Hanna’s
true extent of participa-
tion in those crimes and,
by extension, her guilt. I
cannot disagree more; the
novel does not shirk away
from deconstructing how
guilt is handed around and
shared, painting a grey
picture of how humans
deal with morality in such
circumstances, rather than
the black and white one
people seem to want it to.
The questions that
Michael grapples with are
quite philosophical and
posed in such a way that
they demand the reader
to at least ponder them
before moving on to the
next sentence. Despite
being mostly ignorant of
philosophy, I found these
questions very accessible
and posed in a way that
makes the reader want to
think about them and form
their own opinion rather
than an exercise in high-
lighting the author’s great
intellect. These questions
retain the beauty, or some
might argue the frustrat-
ing aspect, of philosophy:
there is no right answer.

T
he seeds of this
article were
sowed over
December break,
during a weekend I spent
in Hamburg, Germany
and a visit to Lubeck
(Birthplace of Thomas
Mann), followed by a
week in Poland.
I only found out when
in Krakow, that it is desig-
nated a UNESCO city of
literature. This made more
sense after learning about
Krakow’s literary culture
such as the large number
of bookstores, literary fes-
tivals and famous authors
associated with the city.
Having finished the first
book, The Woman of the
Dunes by Kobo Abe, I
picked a second book by
Polish Author Czeslaw
Milosz whilst in Krakow
for the rest of my trip,
reviews of which will be
the subject of this article.
Kobo Abe’s The Wom-
an of the Dunes
This story starts off
with Niki Junpei, a
slightly socially awkward,
avid insect collector who
decides to take a weekend
trip to some sand dunes
in a rural part of Japan,
in hopes of finding rare
or even new species of
beetles. He is subsequent-
ly trapped and enslaved
by the villagers in a sand
dune approximately 60ft
“This book
served as
an excellent
backdrop to
my visit to
Poland”
“This placed
Milosz in a
position to
shed light on
the history
and psyche of
Poland and its
people”
underground together
with an initially cold
woman who houses him.
Kobo Abe skilfully shows
how a person’s inner
monologue and the praxis
into outward action (both
personally and in how he
relates to other people)
changes during such a
dark period of capture,
from initial resistance to
bargaining and blackmail
and finally, the loss of the
desire to escape.
The man first tries to
reason with his captors
to no avail. His efforts to
escape escalate further till
he finally succeeds one
day only to horribly fail by
accidentally falling into a
quicksand pit. He is hu-
miliatingly lowered back
into the pit. Following his
recapture, he slowly loses
the will to escape.
His interaction with
the woman who has been
trapped for much longer
than him yields further
insight into the psyche in
relation to her predica-
ment and the outer world.
At the end, the man has a
workable plan of escape
but decides to postpone
it indefinitely, indicating
his loss of the will to
escape. This ending has
been compared to George
Orwell’s 1984 which bears
remarkable similarities.
On a literal reading,
Kobo Abe does a great job
in showing how a person
responds to an externally
imposed state of impris-
onment and throughout
this read, the very injus-
tice imposed onto both the
man and woman partially
triggered me. This served
as an excellent backdrop
to my visit to Poland
which in the 20th century
was profoundly affected
by both great wars and the
rise and fall of the Soviet
Union.
However, it is also
possible to consider this
story from a metaphys-
ical standpoint of Zen
Buddhism, almost as a
sort of Sisyphean task,
and view the man’s en-
snarement as the mecha-
nism to which humans are
bound to the Maya of the
material world.
Czeslaw Milosz’s The
Captive Mind
Czeslaw Milosz, the
polish author and poet was
the recipient of the 1980
Nobel prize in Literature.
His life story involves
several major events of
the 20th century, (un)
fortunately giving him a
first-hand experience to
paradigm-altering events
such as the rise of Hitler,
the Holocaust and the
rise and fall of the Soviet
Union to name a few.
This placed Milosz in
a position to shed light on
the history and psyche of
Poland and its people and
on the nature of oppres-
sion and totalitarianism,
which he did so exceed-
ingly well in The Captive
Mind. Despite this book
being contextualised
to Stalinism in Eastern
European countries, the
analysis remains relevant
and applicable.
The first three chapters
set up the psychologi-
cal, philosophical and
social context in which a
person’s mind becomes
captive whilst living under
totalitarian rule. The first
chapter describes how and
why Stalinist ideology,
particularly Dialectic Ma-
terialism is stomached by
a person. This is done by
using the metaphor of the
‘Pill of Murti-Bing’ based
on another book written
by Stanislaw Witkiewicz.
The second chapter
details the nature of
Central and Eastern
European people’s per-
ception of the free western
states and its associated
historical and psycholog-
ical tensions and how this
sets the context to which
eastern-bloc intellectuals
may not be drawn to the
west.
The third chapter
describes the practice of
Ketman, where an individ-
ual hides his true beliefs
from others, in doing so,
derives a sense of satisfac-
tion for such deceit. This
partially robs him of the
will to outwardly reject
that ideology.
Milosz then goes on to
describe how four Polish
intellectuals responded
to this paradigm with
outcomes ranging from
successful adaptation, the
loss of the creative spark
or even rejection of the
new system. To end the
book, Milosz describes
the Soviet’s analysis and
approach to controlling
Polish society and its
brutalising of the Baltic
states.
Despite the fact that
I was originally hoping
to pick up a fictional
work by a Polish author,
the strength of Milosz’s
writing and the insights he
provides made it a thor-
oughly enjoyable read and
a great way to learn more
about Poland.
Krakow was designated a UNESCO City of Literature in 2013 // UNESCO
