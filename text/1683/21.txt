Collab Track of
the Year
‘Biking’
Frank Ocean ft.Tyler
the Creator & Jay Z
“God gave you what you
could handle / (Gave you
what you could handle)”
Nominations | ‘Slide’
[Calvin Harris ft. Migos
& Frank Ocean] | ‘It’s
a Vibe’ [2 Chainz ft. Ty
Dolla $ign, Trey Songz
& Jhené Aiko] | ‘Raf’
[A$AP Mob ft. Quavo,
Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti
& Frank Ocean] | ‘Crew’
[Goldlink ft. Brent Faiyaz
& Shy Glizzy]
Collab Tracks are always
surrounded by a lot of an-
ticipation and, in 2017, it
was no different. ‘Crew’
deserves nominations for
2016, 2017, and 2018 –
the song just oozes sauce.
‘Slide’ was probably the
summer banger, bringing
only good vibes. ‘Raf’
marked the triumphant
return of the Mob. ‘It’s a
Vibe’ featured our hippy
bae Jhené, whose sultry
vocals helped 2 Chainz
knock this song out of the
park. However, ‘Biking’
was our winner. ‘Biking’
is the return of the Jay Z
and Frank Ocean combo
with the addition of Odd
Future partner, Tyler.
Never have all three
been on a track together,
but ‘Biking’ shows the
chemistry we’ve seen
on songs like ‘She’ and
numerous tracks from Jay
and Ocean. The theme of
bikes is held throughout

AlbumoftheYear
DAMN.
Kendrick Lamar
[aka Kung-Fu Kenny]
“Sit down (lil’ bitch), be
humble”
Nominations | Flower
Boy, Tyler the Creator
| More Life, Drake |
Laila’s Wisdom, Rapsody
| Big Fish Theory, Vince
Staples
2017 had a plethora of
amazing hip-hop albums,
which only made it more
difficult for us to choose
a single album to give
this award to. Vince
Staples came through
with an electro-inspired
sound, further pushing the
boundaries of the genre.
Drake’s More Life only
served to remind us of the
versatility of his artistry
while delivering the
bangers we’ve come to
expect. Tyler, the Creator
delivered a surprisingly
mature album, discuss-
ing themes including
depression, loneliness,
and his sexuality on this
smooth, introspective,
self-produced album.

Producer of the
Year
Metro Boomin
[aka Young Metro]
“If young Metro don’t
trust you, I’m gon’ shoot
you”
Nominations | Murda
Beatz | Southside |
Zaytoven | Boi1da
In hip-jop, production is
just as important, if not
more so than the lyrics. In
the words of Committee
member and Metro stan,
Jamell, “Metro can do
no wrong. Metro goes in
every single time. Every
single beat is just fire,
straight fire, consistently.”
There’s nothing more to
be said, really.
Honourable Shoutouts |
Steelbanglez | Jae5
The wavy afro-swing
sub-genre blossomed and
flourished in 2017 and
these two producers have
been at the forefront of
this wave, battling it out
for the title of UK Metro
Boomin.
Genius
Rapsody cemented her
position as a top rapper
irrespective of gender
with a carefully curated
album that vibrated posi-
tivity, enabling listeners to
empathise with Rapsody’s
pride and encourages
those who struggle with
being “black and ugly”, to
do the same. However, the
winner has to be Kendrick
Lamar with DAMN.,
which is the only word
suitable to describe this
album after giving it a
listen. K.Dot always finds
a new way to reinvent his
sound, not being shy to
take risks or experiment
and it’s yet to fail him,
delivering another strong
album that is not only
sonically pleasing, but
lyrically intriguing.

Song of the Year
‘Bodak Yellow’
Cardi B
“Said little bitch, you
can’t fuck with me, if you
wanted to”
Nominations | ‘Chanel’
[Frank Ocean] | ‘T-Shirt’
[Migos, Culture] | ‘Live
up to my name’[Baka Not
Nice] | ‘Im so Groovy’
[Future, Future]
There was no shortage of
tunes to pick from in 2017.
There were the bangers,
from Baka’s ‘Live up to
my name’, a clear product
of the OVO sweatshop,
to Migos’ ‘T-Shirt’, a trap
anthem released in what
will probably go down
as the best year of their
career. ‘Chanel’ is one
of Frank’s best solo per-
formances and strongest
expression of his sexuality
to date on a song. It also
features the hard bar that
rappers hadn’t clocked
despite the years they
been talking about buying
chicks Chanel bags: “See
both sides like Chanel”.
Future’s unique flow on
‘I’m so Groovy’ makes it
such a fun song to vibe
to, but there was one
clear winner for song of
the year. Cardi B’s remix
of ‘No Flockin’, ‘Bodak
Yellow’, took the music
industry by storm, like a
Caribbean hurricane in
January, and stood head
and shoulders above the
rest.. The song has almost
become synonymous with
female empowerment and
we’re lowkey starting
to get tired of women
pointing at us and scream-
ing “Said little bitch, you
can’t fuck with me, if you
wanted to”.
Honourable Shoutout |
‘Do not Disturb’ [Drake,
More Life]
The 6 God ends his More
Life escapade with an
open and honest look
back at his thoughts and
feelings as he was writing
Views. Snoh Allegra’s
‘Time’, was heavily
sampled in the production
and gives the track a level
of vulnerability that is
rare, even for Drake. “I
was an angry yout’ when
I was writin’ Views, saw a
side of myself that I just
never knew, I’ll probably
self destruct if I ever lose
but I never do”.
R&B Album of
the Year
CTRL
SZA
“My man is my man is
your man, heard it’s her
man too”
Nominations | Process,
Sampha | Freudian,
Daniel Caesar | Morning
After, dvsn | Sonder Son,
Brent Faiyaz
It could be argued that
2017 was a better year
for R&B than it was for
hip-hop, with a sudden
resurgence of new and
creative sounds for what
was thought to be an
already matured genre.
Brent Faiyaz’s Sonder
Son managed to bring
the old school ‘90s R&B
sound new into a new age.
Daniel Ceasar’s Freudian
is sure to have been played
at weddings around the
world. dvsn managed to
encapsulate everybody’s
relationship problems
into a single album with
Morning After, containing
situations so specific
I thought my ex had
personally phoned them
to complain. Sampha’s
Process was iconic,
expressing the emotions
of loss, love, and growth
within multiple tracks. He
uses his unique voice to
tell the story of his mother
passing away and only
servedtoprovewhyDrake
has him involved in all his
projects. However, there
could only be one winner.
SZA takes the award with
her debut album, CTRL,
an astounding album
written almost entirely
from the perspective of a
sidechick. For too long,
the women on the side
have been neglected in the
music industry and CTRL
plays a pivotal role in
shining a light onto their
plight, raising awareness
and starting a necessary
dialogue on proper
mistress management.
UK Album of the
Year
Gang Signs and
Prayer
Stormzy
“I phone Flipz then I tell
him that he got this/ This
is God’s plan, they can
never stop this”
Nominations | Common
Sense, J Hus | FR32,
Wretch 32 | NO
BULLSHIT, Avelino |
Leage of my Own II, Chip
The UK Music scene has
recently been thrust into
the global limelight and,
therefore, great bodies
of work were essential to
maintain momentum and
show the world the best
of what UK rap and grime
could deliver. Fortunately,
they did deliver with some
stellar projects, from Ave-
lino’s NO BULLSHIT, to
Chip’s extensive League
of my Own II, where he
proves yet again that he
doesn’t run out of bars.
Wretch produced another
solid album with FR32,
but the discussion for
best UK album had two
clear frontrunners. J
Hus’ Common Sense and
Stormzy’s Gang Signs
And Prayer are both spec-
tacular bodies of work, es-
pecially considering they
are both debut albums.
Common Sense has a song
for every mood and vibe
and is such an enjoyable
and easy listen, ranging
from AfroBeat inspired
bangers to suprising intro-
spective moments about
Hus’ life and upbringing.
Stormzy took the streets
of the UK to church
with big momets such as
‘Blinded by your Grace’,
‘21 Gun Salute’ and ‘100
Bags’. This was probably
the hardest decision that
the Committee had to
make and, althought we
still aren’t entirely sure
that we’ve got it right, we
have decided that Stormzy
is the winner.
Debut Album of
the Year
No Dope on
Sundays
Cyhi the Prince
[aka Kanye’s ghost
writer]
2017 was full of plenty of
standout debut projects.
Sampha, Stormzy and
J Hus held it down for
the UK with their stellar
albums. SZA’s CTRL,
Khalid’s American Teen,
6LACK’s FREE 6LACK
and Daniel Caesar’s
Freudian were all smooth
R&B offerings. On the
hip-hop front, Jaden Smith
and XXXTENTACION
produced surprisingly
impressive debut albums
in the cinematic SYRE
and the short but potent
17, respectively. While Lil
Yachty and Lil Uzi Vert
disappointed with their
trash projects, Teenage
Emotions and Luv is Rage
2, respectively, the Com-
mittee decided to award
Cyhi the Prynce for his
effort on the excellent No
Dope on Sundays.
Viral Song of the
Year
‘Man’s Not Hot’
Big Shaq
“The ting go skrrappp”
Although tracks like
Lil Uzi Vert’s ‘XO Tour
Llif3’, Future’s ‘Mask
Off’ and Lil Pump’s
‘Gucci Gang’ sparked
online hysteria with
memes littered across
social media, Playboi
Carti’s ‘Magnolia’ and
Kodak Black’s ‘Tunnel
Vision’ sparked dance
crazes, and Jay Z’s ‘The
Story of OJ’ sparked a
much-needed dialogue
and social commentary,
two tracks stand out as
the most viral of 2017.
Cardi B’s ‘Bodak Yellow’
became an anthem for
female empowerment
but the NeighbourHOOD
Grammys Committee
has to award Big Shaq’s
‘Man’s Not Hot’. Michael
Daapah [aka Big Shaq]
was the man of the year in
2017 and everybody from
my 4 year old cousin to
my grandma knows “the
ting go SKRRAP”.
a song full of double
entendres. Jay comes
through with a standout
prelude to the vocals of
Frank, which deliver on
the lush production. The
hook is a stand out for
the track along with Tyler
coming through with
one of his best verses to
date, enabling him to add
‘Killed Jay on a Track’ to
his CV.
Honourable Shoutout |
‘Bahamas’ [A$AP Mob
ft. Lil Yachty, ScHoolboy
Q, Smooky MarGielaa,
KEY!]
‘Bahamas’ deserves its
honourable shoutout
off the basis of three
absolutely amazing lines:
“Your wife wanna throw
me vagina / I fuck on your
aunt, ya mama”, A$AP
Rocky, “New Shades,
Gosha / Got me looking
like a Beatle”, A$AP Ferg
and, finally, quite possibly
our favourite line ever,
‘Let a Groovy nigga in it’,
ScHoolboy Q.
UK Newcomer of
the Year
Not3s
“I am so fly like Aladdin/
I steer the ship, I’m the
captain”
Nominations | Jorja
Smith | Ray Blk | Mabel |
Hardy Caprio
Plenty of new names
surfaced in the UK in
2017. Mabel had a sleeper
hit with ‘Finders Keepers’
which shot her from
being unknown even in
the underground to being
one of the top prospects
for the UK. Ray Blk won
the BBC’s sound of 2017
award and Hardy Caprio
had an absolute banger
with ‘Super Soaker’.
However, the top two
contenders for the Com-
mittee were Jorja Smith,
whose recent work with
Drake and Preditah have
catapulted her into the
mainstream and Not3s
who has had a succession
of strong singles followed
by a very solid EP. In
the end, the decision was
made to award Not3s,
while we eagerly antici-
pate Jorja’s debut album.
Feature Verse of
the Year
Dave- ‘Peligro’
[Giggs, Wamp 2 Dem]
“Big cougar ting on all
fours/ Man, it feels like
I’ve got a tiger tryna
tackle me”
minations | Young
Nominations | Young
Thug- ‘Sacrifices’ [Drake,
More Life] | XXXTENT-
ACION- ‘Roll in Peace’
[Kodack Black, Project
Baby 2] |Kendrick
Lamar- ‘Mask Off Remix’
[Future] | Rihanna-
‘Lemon’ [N.E.R.D., No
One Ever Really Dies]
Rappers seem to save
their best verses for other
people’s songs for some
reason, and this year was
no different, with lots of
big verses being spat from
guest appearances. You’re
probably wondering what
Rihanna is doing on this
list. Well, although she
is a singer, bad gal Riri
came harder than most
rappers on N.E.R.D.’s
‘Lemon’. As he eloquent-
ly put it, Young Thug was
“talking neat like a geek”
on Drake’s ‘Sacrifices’.
Kendrick Lamar killed
it as per and XXX spat a
hype verse. However we
decided to award Dave,
one of the artists to watch
in 2018, for completely
killing Giggs on ‘Peligro’.
