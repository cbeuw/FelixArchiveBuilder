One man records himself many times over
Garage-dwelling Ty Segall is back with another rock-your-socks-off album, a Pollock-esque splatter-painting of
genres that’s money-back guaranteed to amuse and delight fans of psych rock everywhere.
T
here’s no deny-
ing Ty Segall is
a prodigy, but his
new (tenth) full
length album, Freedom’s
Goblin, cements his place
as the father of modern
psych rock. Segall had
been hinting at an album
for a while, dropping nu-
merous promising singles,
but nothing could prepare
us for the project that
followed. The Californian
mastermind lets
his wide range of influ-
ences bleed through into
his music, allowing a
multi-coloured stream of
punk, rock, psych, folk
and funk to shine through,
showing huge freedom
in style and utilising the
double album format
to its full experimental
capacity. The result is a
project that’s passionately
funny, expansive, violent
and concise all at the same
“Ty Segall is a
great example
of a true
genius who
effortlessly
employs
the DIY
experimental
attitude
associated
with modern
garage rock”
Rex’s 1973 LP Tanx. It’s
no wonder Segall released
a cover album of their
material – 2015’s Ty Rex.
No one is ready for what
comes next. ‘Meaning’
kicks up some percussive
bangs and guitar screeches
before charging head first
into a fem-punk distortion
onslaught dragging you
along in the dirt and wake
of its carnage. Ty Segall’s
wife Denée shouts “I see
fear in freedom!” while
Ty steers the bull around
the pen and right out the
fucking gates. Abruptly,
the band slides to the
other end of the spectrum
with ‘Cry Cry Cry,’ a
Beatles-esque ballad with
tropical swinging psyche-
delic twangs. Freedom’s
Goblin is truly released
at this point; the band’s
guitarists battle doom
riffs on ‘She’ and spiral
into yet more sax-infused
madness, this time going
full psychobilly on
‘Talkin 3’. Finally, instead
of fading out, the band
throw down ‘And, Good-
night’, a sprawling twelve
minute electrified cover of
their surreal 2013 single
‘Sleeper’. The album had
already blown my mind
and this song serves as the
perfect head-fuck into a
comedown.
The album is a symbi-
otic mix of the beautifully
messy and the overpow-
eringly crisp, owed to
the outstanding nature
of anything Steve Albini
touches. Ty Segall is a
great example of a true
genius who effortlessly
employs the DIY exper-
imental attitude associ-
ated with modern garage
rock. Despite the album
spanning 19 songs and
clocking in at an hour and
fifteen minutes, Freedom’s
Goblin doesn’t feel drawn
out in the slightest, and
leaves the listener with a
taste for more that only
Segall can satisfy – and I
have no doubt he will.
I mean, it’s not The Life of Pablo, but for a collage, it still stands out. // Drag City

FREEDOM’S GOBLIN
introduce some piano into
the mix. Ty comes off as
melancholic and contem-
plative, sounding almost
like Thom Yorke in places
on this track. These songs
set the tone for the rest of
the album as Segall flirts
with a whole range of
emotions and personality
traits - which is in part
what makes him such an
interesting and relatable
performer.
The albums then takes
a disco funk detour into a
cover of Hot Chocolate’s
1978 track ‘Every 1’s a
Winner’. The band act as
tutors, demonstrating a
masterclass in distorted
fuzz riffs, enlisting the
help of actor and long-
time friend Fred Armisen
on percussion. ‘Despoiler
of Cadaver’ catches the
wave and continues riding
the bubbling juicy funk
for all its worth. The con-
versation over this song
is indulgently sexy, weird
and sinister, in the best
kind of way possible.
‘When Mommy Kills
You’ leaves you chasing
the thread of the album
as chords and distortion
continue to bewilderingly
jump around, never
leaving you quite enough
time to grasp the song,
while the high backing
vocals taunt you. ‘My
Lady’s On Fire’ treads on
some common ground,
drawing influence from
T. Rex and shows off
Ty’s songwriting skills,
resulting in an optimistic
and lively but equally sad
song. The melodies of the
song get under your skin,
and the hornlines on top
blow them throughout,
scattering and irrevocably
entwining them with you.
This Marc Bolan influence
is made clearer on ‘The
Main Pretender,’ which
throws a sax into the mix,
heavily referencing T.

‘Fanny Dog’ opens the
album; as heavy layered
guitar beatings ensue, Ty
allows his raw vocals to
lead you through
a goofy song
about his
dog.
