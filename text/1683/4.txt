The trial of Winston Churchill and the British
Empire he helped to build
“The Bengal
famine killed
over 3 million
loyal citizens
as a result of
Churchill’s
racist views”
C
arthage must be
destroyed, the
Roman Senator
Cato the Elder
decried at the end of all
his speeches, irrespective
of the original topic at
hand. As a result of the
tenacity of the war-mon-
gering Roman elite, a once
mighty civilization was
reduced to rubble. Thus,
if history teaches us any-
thing, it is that consensus
can be achieved by merely
reinforcing any viewpoint
repeatedly. The white-
washing of the crimes
and odious views of
Winston Leonard Spencer
Churchill has been very
successful due to the
barrage of bipartisan and
universal reverence given
to him. This is a danger-
ous example of history
being rewritten by the tide
of adulation presented
by numerous books and
films – most recently Joe
Wright’s Darkest Hour, in
which Gary Oldman plays
Churchill.
After watching Darkest
Hour, one can not help
but be impressed by
Oldman’s performance
and consequently fall prey
to the reluctant hero image
of Churchill that has been
cultivated since 1945. The
true legacy of Churchill,
however, is far more
complicated and requires
honest introspection.
One the most inaccu-
rate scenes from the film
shows Churchill riding the
tube on his way to Parlia-
ment, and in the process,
by talking to the average
Brit, he gains the courage
to oppose any notion of
surrender. This would
have been uncharacteristic
of the man who once said,
“the best argument against
democracy is a five-min-
ute conversation with the
average voter”. While this
harmless scene was added
for cinematic effect, it
nonetheless contained a
dangerous rewriting of
history, especially since
one of the “average Brits”
that Churchill interacted
with was a black man of
African descent. The real
Churchill was a white-su-
premacist who fervently
opposed any immigration
to the UK by people of
colour, making it unlikely
that real Churchill would
have ever treated a black
man as an equal constit-
uent, to whom he was
accountable.
The purpose of
this article is to bring
forth an indictment of
the high crimes and
misdemeanours of
one of history’s worst
imperialists. Genocide,
use of ‘weapons of
mass-destruction’ against
civilians, and being an
ardent believer in racial
superiority are only the tip
of the iceberg.
However, before any of
the lesser known travesties
are examined, we need to
address the biggest myth
of all: Churchill having
the foresight regarding the
need to combat the evil of
totalitarianism. While it
is true that Churchill had
come to realise the danger
Hitler posed from the early
years of the Third Reich,
his zealot-like opposition
to socialism meant he
was a strong advocate for
British neutrality during
the Spanish Civil War.
Because of this morally
bankrupt policy, the fascist
coalition of Mussolini
and Hitler strengthened
and propelled Franco
to power. The silence
towards the Blitzkrieg
perpetrated on Barcelona
and the other great cities
of Spain was deafening.
In fact, in the late 1920s,
Churchill openly admired
Mussolini’s brutal crack-
down on communists by
praising how “fascism
has rendered a service
to the entire world”.
Churchill, as displayed by
the political positions he
took throughout his life,
opposed Nazism not out
of any consistent moral
compass but instead to
preserve the tyranny of
the British Empire. While
Churchill was waging war
on behalf of the Poles
and Czechs to restore
their trampled rights, he
was also systematically
denying those very rights
to the colonised world.
The aura of Churchill
stems from the image
of the underdog status
Britain unfortunately
gained when it stood alone
in Europe fighting against
the Nazis. However, the
truth couldn’t be further
from the fictitious image
of little Britain standing
alone. Britain was never
alone during the war.
The prime-ministers of
“white” commonwealth
nations of Australia, New
Zealand, Canada, South
Africa, and Rhodesia
pledged their continued
support even after the
fall of France. However,
the most astonishing acts
of solidarity are found
among those who were
not privileged with the
rights of equality and
universal suffrage; those
who were not the masters
of their destinies, yet still
volunteered to fight for
democracy and freedom
in Europe (those very
rights which were denied
to them). India alone con-
tributed over 2.5 million
volunteers to fight in the
war, who were accompa-
nied by their comrades
from the Caribbean,
Africa, the Middle East,
and South East Asia.
The likes of Mao and
Stalin are correctly placed
in the pantheon of brutal
dictators alongside Hitler
and Mussolini, for the
mass-starvation they
inflicted on their people.
The legacy of the British
Raj was catastrophic
famines, none more so
than the Bengal famine of
1943-44. These were not
natural events, but direct
consequences of callous
policies. The Bengal
famine killed over 3
million loyal citizens as a
result of Churchill’s racist
views regarding Indians –
he ordered the export of
more than 70,000 tonnes
of grain out of India in
July of 1943 to shore up
reserves in Britain and
for a disastrous campaign
in Greece. In Churchill’s
own words, “starvation
of anyhow under-fed
Bengalis is less serious
than sturdy Greeks”.
Churchill’s ambivalence

In films like Darkest Hour, Winston Churchill is whitewashed as an elder statesman whose
warnings were ignored. It’s time we examine his imperialist legacy.
towards the suffering of
Indians was considered
extreme , even by his con-
tempories. When ardent
imperialists like Leopold
Amery – secretary of
state for India – implored
Churchill to act, his only
response was “Indians
breed like rabbits”, that
they “are beastly people”,
and asking “why isn’t
Gandhi dead yet?” More
troublingly, when con-
science stricken leaders
in Canada, Australia, and
America offered to send
grain to relieve the famine,
Churchill declined in the
fear that they may be sunk
by Japanese submarines.
How was this any differ-
ent to Stalin’s Holodomor
in the Ukraine?
for the age of empire.
However, Churchill
maintained to his cabinet
that this pledge only
extended to the citizens
of Europe, proclaiming
“I have not become the
King’s First Minister in
order to preside over the
liquidation of the British
Empire.”
Even if one were to be
charitable and not level
the charge of genocide
but instead the milder
accusation of criminal
negligence in handling
the Bengal famine, the
Mau-Mau rebellion does
not leave any room for
ambiguity. After Church-
ill’s return to power in
1951, his government
oversaw the suspension
of habeas-corpus and
the forced detention of
150,000 Kenyans – men,
women and children –
into concentration camps
in which rape, castration,
and electric shock torture
were the norm. All this
was done to protect the
colonial apartheid regime.
What was promised to
have been left behind in
Nuremburg continued
under Churchill’s su-
pervision. However, it
should not have come as a
surprise: after all Church-
ill was mightily impressed
by the first ever concen-
tration camps during the
Boer War.
The Geneva Protocol of
1928 which outlawed the
use of chemical and bio-
logical weapons did not
materialise in a vacuum.
Poison gas continued to
be in use in warfare after
the First World War, once
again with Churchill’s
approval. Whilst serving
as the Secretary of State
for the Colonies in 1921
he expressed his desire to
use “poisoned gas against
the uncivilized tribes”
and to provoke “terror”
in order to subdue any
resistance to British rule
in Mesopotamia (modern
day Iraq).
Churchill’s contempt
for the people of the
Middle East was groomed
in his early years as a
solider in the Anglo-Af-
ghan War in the late
19th
century. He would
later write with a proud
boast of how the British
“destroyed the houses,
filled up the wells, burned
the crops, and broke the
reservoirs in punitive dev-
astation” to unleash terror
on the the native Pashtun
tribes.
to his war-time ally
Joseph Stalin, “because I
intend to write it”. Unlike
the other two leaders of
allied coalition, Roosevelt
– who died in office weeks
before the war would end
– and Stalin, Churchill’s
six volume, Nobel prize
winning account of WWII
would shape his enduring
image as a wartime leader.
And so Churchill was
right: history has been
very kind to him. Very
little is ever written about
the disastrous Norwegian
Campaign of 1940, which
was planned and executed
by Churchill, but would
result in Neville Cham-
berlin losing support and
ironically propel Church-
ill’s rise to power.
It is important to note
that, to his contempories,
Churchill wasn’t particu-
larly popular. Throughout
the 1930s, due to his
racist opposition to the
Government of India
Act, he was relegated as
people of colour, his early
warnings on Hitler might
not have fallen on deaf
ears. Interestingly, even
after “leading” Britain to
victory, he was given the
“order of the boot” by the
publicinanoverwhelming
defeat in the 1945 general
election. Churchill was a
not a reconciliatory figure.
He never expressed regret
about his treatment of
people of colour within
the British empire. The
universal admiration
given to Churchill is
synonymous with what
Noam Chomsky calls the
“manufacture of consent”.
The reality remains that in
many of the former British
colonies, Churchill is not
revered as a liberator,
but is derided as a gross
hypocrite, racist, and an
unrepentent imperialist.
Churchill should be held in the same regard as colonialists like Cecil Rhodes // CC
“Churchill
showed no
remorse
towards the
historical
injustices
suffered
by Native
American
people”
It wasn’t just Indians
that Churchill despised.
He referred to Pales-
tinian Arabs as “dogs”
and showed no remorse
towards the historiacl
injustices suffered by Na-
tive-American and Abo-
riginal-Australian people.
Churchill’s obscene racial
views would be abhor-
rent to any fair-minded
individual – yet they are
always omitted in his
countless portrayals in
the media. The Atlantic
Charter, which cemented
the Anglo-American
alliance, was signed with
wildly different interpre-
tation. To Franklin Roo-
sevelt the commitment
of “right to self-determi-
nation” extended to all
of humanity, serving as
the final nail in the coffin
“Many of the
problems
facing the
Middle
East can be
traced back
as products
of British
Imperialism
from Palestine
to Iran”
Many of the problems
facing the Middle East
are still a direct product
of British imperialism,
from Palestine to Iran.
After Churchill returned
to power in 1951, the
disastrous policies he ad-
vocated would ultimately
produce the unintended
consequence of estab-
lishing a rogue theocratic
regime a generation later.
In order to protect the
interests of private British
oil corporations, the CIA,
with the urgings of British
government, orchestrated
the return to power of the
brutal Shah of Iran in a
coup against the secular
and democratically
elected leader of Iran,
Mohammad Mosaddegh.
Churchill was con-
sistently on the wrong
side of history for most
of the important issues
of his time – his fierce
opposition to the women’s
suffrage movement, for
example, was exemplified
by him saying “nothing
would induce me to vote
for giving women the
franchise”.
“History will be kind to
me,” Churchill remarked
“The reality
remains that
in many of the
former British
colonies,
Churchill is not
revered as a
liberator but
derided as an
unrepentent
imperialist”
a political pariah. Had
Churchill had a more
enlightened view towards
