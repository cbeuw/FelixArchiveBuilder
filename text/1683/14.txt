If you could live a beautiful dream, why would you
wake up to reality?
I
have never enjoyed
Chinese opera.
Chinese opera to
Chinese youth
nowadays is a bit like
what Shakespeare is to
English-speaking youth –
something confined to the
realm of literary studies.
And if they are popularly
enjoyed, often it is only
in some form of modern
adaptation.
For just three nights last
week, The Guangzhou
Dramatic Arts Centre
brought their production
of the Chinese opera The
Handan Dream to the
UK stage at the Hackney
Empire. Despite my reser-
vations, I was pleasantly
surprised by how much
I enjoyed it. For starters,
I could understand what
they were saying – tra-
ditional Chinese opera
is often sung in a shrill
dialect, which is difficult
for the untrained ear to
fully make out.
The Handan Dream
was written by Tang
Xianzu, a poet and drama-
tist in the later years of the
Ming Dynasty in China.
Although separated by
geography and culture,
Tang and Shakespeare
happened to live at the
same time, and even
died in the same year,
1616. Both playwrights
produced work that
explored the timeless
aspects of human nature
– expressions of life that
transcended time and
space. It is no wonder that
both thus left significant
legacies in their respective
cultures.
The ‘Handan Road’
refers to the road en route
to the state exams, which
passes through the city of
Handan. Over the years it
has acquired a metaphor-
ical meaning, referring
to the journey one takes
to officialdom. In ancient
China, an intellectual’s
foremost goal is to study
hard, pass these official
exams, and become an
official.
The Handan Dream
follows the protagonist
Lu, an intellectual who
has spent his whole life
studying the classical
works with the aim of
walking the Handan road
and passing the state
exams with flying colours.
However, we see him on
his fourth journey, after
having failed the exam
three times before. On the
way, he stops by an inn
where a Taoist priest gives
him a magic pillow, on
which he falls asleep while
waiting for his millet meal
to cook. Lu is whisked
into a parallel life where
he meets and marries a
lady of wealth, bribes
the officials and passes
the exams. He becomes a
decorated official only to
fall into the traps of fame
and wealth, and after a
life of ups and downs he
settles to celebrate his 80th
birthday – only to wake
up from the dream.
The Taoist priest
suggests that perhaps this
vision of an ‘ideal’ life is
trapping his reality, and
that perhaps, happiness is
within reach as long as Lu
can let this vision go, as in
a dream. Lu refuses, and
keeps the magic pillow,
preferring instead to live
his dream.
The central idea of
this play can be summed
up in the Taoist priest’s
poetic verse: “I look back,
smile and pass Handan
without a rest”. This idea
of ‘looking back with a
smile’ is a particularly
Chinese expression of
letting things go. Indeed,
director Wang Xiaodi
wanted this adaptation
to focus on this philo-
sophical attitude of Tang
Xianzu, basing her script
adaptation, set, costumes
and other aspects on this
idea – rather than the more
typical interpretation of
the play as a criticism of
officialdom.
And indeed, when it
comes down to it, what is
an ‘ideal life’? Is it what
society has conditioned
us to believe is the ideal
path for us, or is it what
we really want? It is
difficult to say why Lu
is so bent on the Handan
road, and whether he had
stopped to explore his
own motivations. And if
it is something external
– people often pass the
exams by bribing – what
does it take to shake the
dreams off with a laugh?
Perhaps the ideal life is
simply an illusion, a red
herring, only as real as the
dream Lu had.
Although Tang origi-
nally wrote The Handan
Dream as a traditional
Chinese opera, this ad-
aptation presented it as a
‘ci ju’, or ‘poetic drama’,
which is a similar style to
how Shakespeare writes in
verse. It retains the beauty
of the poetic language
while being more accessi-
ble to modern audiences.
This production also made
use of what is known as
‘freehand stage design’, a
feature of Chinese opera
where the stage is split into
two layers, one represent-
ing reality while the other
the dream. During the per-
formance, the separation
between the two shifts and
overlaps, representing the
arbitrary separation and
Lu’s movement between
the two.
The protagonist Lu is
a typical member of the
ancient Chinese intellec-
tual community. This play
makes use of fantastical
elements to explore their
outlook towards life, mo-
tivations and understand-
ing of their fate, while at
the same time expanding
into a wider discussion
on human nature and the
examined life.
Tang Xianzu’s classic Ming dynasty opera ponders this very question, in a new adaptation by the Guangzhou
Dramatic Arts Centre.

THE HANDAN DREAM
Try a Little Tenderness: The Brothers Size at theYoung
Vic
Magical,lyrical,life-affirming–therevivalofataleofbrotherlylovebythewriterofMoonlightisnecessaryviewing
P
lays and movies
don’t often get
written about
young, working
class, black men; in the
rare instances that they
are the focus, the light
in which they are shown
can be less than flatter-
ing. Portrayals are often
one-dimensional, heavy
on aggression and toxic
masculinity. In this land-
scape of facile stereotypes
which are dismissive at
best and openly racist at
worst, playwright Tarell
Alvin McCraney’s work is
an oasis of richly layered,
tender writing.
Much like Moonlight,
for which McCraney won
an Oscar last year, The
Brothers Size explores
the bonds between black
men and the complexities
of Southern masculinity.
The play, back at the
Young Vic after a decade,
is steeped in allusions
to Yoruba mythology. It
follows two brothers in
Louisiana. Oshoosi, who
is younger, has just been
released from the State
Penitentiary and is living
with his older brother
whilst on parole. Ogun,
named for the Yoruba
god of hard labour,
wants Oshoosi to clean
up his act and get back
into work. Straight-laced
Ogun and happy-go-
lucky Oshoosi clash as
long-buried emotions rise
to the surface, and the two
attempt to negotiate the
bittersweet path to rec-
onciliation despite being
haunted by Oshoosi’s
time in prison. Entangled
in this family tension is
Oshoosi’s prison-mate
and erstwhile lover, the
charming Elegba, who
Ogun does not trust.
From a relatively
simple narrative of
reunion McCraney
weaves a script that feels
Anne Carson-esque, on
the cusp between poetry
and prose. The natural-
istic quickfire dialogue
is peppered with lyrical
monologues periodically,
the characters slip into
song, recalling memories
that seem inextricably
linked with the melodies.
Unusually at times the
actors pause to announce
their stage directions. This
is a consciously modernist
approach and it takes
“It would be
easy for the
play to fall
apart, but the
sheer charisma
of the three
leads make
McCraney’s
writing soar”
some getting used to, but
on the whole it works –
adding comic flair to some
scenes, and conjuring up a
woozy, dream-like atmos-
phere in others.
It is an arresting and
often profound piece of
writing, but a script as idi-
osyncratic as McCraney’s
stands or falls on the skill
of the actors. In director
Bijan Sheibani’s produc-
tion, there is nowhere to
hide: there are no props,
no scenery, and no stage.
Encircled on all sides by
the audience, the actors
perform inside a white
chalk circle. It would be
easy for the play to fall
apart, choked by its own
intricacies, but the sheer
blinding charisma of the
three leads – Jonathan
Ajayi, Sope Dirisu, and
Anthony Welsh – make
McCraney’s writing soar.
Sheibani, who was
lauded for his work on The
Barbershop Chronicles,
along with choreographer
Aline David, directs the
trio to move together in
sublime harmony. With
lithe, muscular grace, they
tumble, sway, and dance
around each other, palms,
arms, face becoming
covered in scattered
red chalk, all the while
speaking in a Southern
patois - at once colloquial
and lyrical. Each delivers
a performance that is
emotionally resonant
and seems deeply real.
Jonathan Ajayi who is yet
to leave stage school plays
Oshoosi with deftness, his
care-free facade cracking
as the play progresses.
Sope Dirisu is excep-
tional as Ogun: the scene
in which he confronts
Oshoosi for his selfish-
ness, voice cracking as
he absolves himself of the
crushing responsibility
he has felt for his young
brother his whole life, is
perhaps the most moving
performance I’ve seen on
the London stage.
“To be a Negro in this
country and to be relative-
ly conscious is to be in a
rage almost all the time”
James Baldwin wrote
of the African American
experience. The Brothers
Size is a play brimming
with anger – anger at
poverty, at racism, at the
prison-industrial complex
that obstructs any mean-
ingful rehabilitation.
Where lesser playwrights
might double down on
heartbreak, McCraney
is unafraid to let in the
light – this is a play full of
laughter, love and music,
all of which sharpen the
anger and poignancy.
In a minimalist pro-
end however, the drums
stop and a slightly tinny
recording of Try a Little
Tenderness takes over as
Ogun and Oshoosi sing
along to the Otis Redding
classic. Ogun chided for
having an awful voice,
mimes along to the instru-
mentals, sliding smoothly
from keyboard to oboe,
face beaming with joy
as his younger brother
croons out the chorus.
It is a scene worthy of
the sappiest romantic
comedy, encapsulating
the deep bond of love and
childlike playfulness that
remains between siblings
even after hard times.
Packed into an un-
forgettable 90 minutes,
this is a production that
crackles with energy. In
the days since I watched
it, I haven’t been able
to get it off my mind.
January has barely ended
but I’m pining my colours
to the Young Vic’s revival:
The Brothers Size is, and
is very much likely to
remain, the play of 2018.
