Recent Imperial graduate Konstantin Holzner took travelling to the next level by converting an old fire truck into
a camper van and shipping it all the way to Canada for an unforgettable roadtrip across the Americas.

A
bout three days
into our trip, I
found myself
sitting on a
beach in St. Vincent’s Bay,
Newfoundland. It’s pretty
stunning in general, but
for about six weeks every
summer it becomes a
particularly breath-taking
place to be. Humpback
whales are abundant in
these waters during that
time, and this beach is
the perfect spot for land-
based whale watching,
with humpbacks coming
within ten meters of the
spectators on the beach.
The sea here is teaming
with little fish that the
whales are feeding on,
and the odd bigger wave
washes a handful of them
ashore – easiest fish BBQ
ever.
As I sat there, in awe of
these majestic creatures,
it occurred to me that this
was the first time I had
been completely relaxed
in a good long while. The
previous months had been
a crazy frenzy. In prepa-
ration for our big trip, my
wife and I had bought an
old German fire engine.
The week I was trying to
finish my PhD (a relative-
ly stressful feat in itself)
and weekends were spent
toiling away on the fire
engine to build the perfect
campervan. Although we
were busy seven days a
week, there was some-
thing incredibly satisfying
about swapping the lab for
a real hands-on job with
guaranteed progress every
weekend.
Most of the rest of our
time was spent planning
the trip, trying to sort out
the logistics of shipping
our van to Canada, and
insurance for ourselves
and the camper. Just two
weeks before our depar-
ture date I passed my viva.
Somehow we also found
time to throw in a surprise
wedding at our leaving
party just ten days before
our flight to St. John’s,
Newfoundland (at only
5.5 hours flight time from
London, this amazing
little town should be on
everyone’s bucket list!).
We’d been planning
this trip for a very long
time, and we had both
dreamt about driving the
Pan-American highway
before we’d even met.
Now it was finally hap-
pening! We had shipped
our old fire truck from
Liverpool to Halifax on
the east coast of Canada.
From there we drove
across Canada to the west
coast and up to Alaska.
The plan is to follow the
west coast from there
until, about 18 months
later, we hit Ushuaia in
Argentina, the southern-
most city in the world.
It’s easy to think you
understand that Canada is
a big country by looking
at the map, but we’ve
now realised that only by
driving from one coast to
the other can you really
appreciate just how big
it really is. We’ve taken
about three months to
drive coast to coast and
put about 18,000 extra
kilometres on the clock
of our trusty van. In
between, we’ve often
felt that we could easily
spend our entire trip in
this amazing country and
still wouldn’t be able to
explore all its breath-tak-
ing wilderness. There are
some great cities too, but
it’s the end-of-the-road
communities and sitting
by a campfire (many
lit with pages from my
thesis, very therapeutic)
in the middle of nowhere
in the Yukon that have left
the biggest impressions
on us. We’ve met a lot
of amazing people too,
and travelling in an old
fire truck definitely helps.
It’s a great conversation
starter.
Late in October, on our
way south from Alaska
along the west coast, we
hit black ice in northern
BC and tipped over the
van in a ditch. Dream
over? Unfortunately, the
damage to the vehicle was
pretty substantial. We had
crashed in the middle of
nowhere and needed to
get towed about 700 km
to the nearest garage that
could help. Two months
later we’re still waiting
for spare parts from
Germany.
Fed up with the relent-
less rain in Vancouver,
we hired a car to explore
the west coast of the USA
whilst we’re waiting. The
trip must go on! We’re
very sad not to be in our
van for this part of our
trip, but once it’s back on
the road, we’ll head down
to Mexico and pick up
our trip from there. For
now we’re just excited
to explore some more of
America’s great National
Parks.
