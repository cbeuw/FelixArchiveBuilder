ecoming Shades
is one of
several shows
h e a d l i n i n g
VAULT Festival 2018.
Billed as London’s answer
to Edinburgh Fringe
this festival showcases
performances from new
and emerging artists and
is a veritable hotbed of
alternative theatre. From
24th
January to 18th
March
it takes over the labyrinth
of tunnels below Waterloo
station every Wednesday
to Sunday with a program
packed with theatre, film
and comedy.
Created by Lon-
don-based contemporary
circus team, Chivaree
Circus, this show is a
mix of circus and theatre,
featuring fire-breathing,
acrobatics and aerialists.
It’s loosely based on
the myth of Persephone
and her abduction by
Hades, God of the Un-
derworld. The audience
is greeted by a masked
figure, Charon, and
invited to journey into the
underworld with Charon
and the three ‘Furies’,
performers wearing
dog-like headgear, repre-
senting the three-headed
dog Cerberus. It’s a far cry
from the standard seated
show you might expect
though: the audience are
guided through the vast,
open space that is the
Forge, the Vaults’ largest
venue, as the performance
takes place around us, the
cast gently shepherding us
from place to place. We
gather around Rebecca
Rennison as Persephone
for a contemporary dance
sequence, the three Furies
enthrall with juggling
and fire-breathing – a
representation of Hades –
and we are led across the
Forge in a journey that
mimics Persephone’s on
the river Styx, here repre-
sented by ropes pulled by
the cast.
This is where the
performance begins to
focused less on storytell-
ing and more on awe and
spectacle. However, this
focus doesn’t always play
to its strength – in many
parts it feels more like a
sequence of separate acts
than a story as a whole
and many seemingly key
aspects are easily lost on
the audience. The cast
clearly represent Perse-
phone, Hades and other
inhabitants of the under-
world, but the details of
who they are get easily
lost.
In a lesser show, this
might have been perfor-
mance-ruining, but the
strength of the performers
is such that, even when
it’s confusing, Becoming
Shades is still somehow
amazing. At one point we
are invited to encircle a
lonesome figure dancing
on a pole, taunted by the
other performers around
her. Her dance is amazing
and the claustrophobia of
the audience and other
cast members encircling
her only adds to the sense
of palpable distress. This
is far from the only im-
pressive routine; there’s
more amazing acrobatic
work, with elaborate
acrobatic performances
using only ribbons and
rings suspended from the
ceiling.
This isn’t to stay that
the entire show is flawless.
A brief comic interlude
on ‘how to train your
hellhound’ is jarring – it
makes little sense and the
tone is so completely out
of keeping with the rest
of the performance that it
seems hardly part of the
same show.
The all-female cast are
without a doubt the best
part of Becoming Shades.
Rebecca Rennison
as Persephone really
leaves an impression;
as does Alfa Marks as
Hades. Rosie Bartley,
Jessica Pearce and Isobel
Midnight are brilliant as
the ‘Furies’. They drive
the performance, forming
the bridge between the
beautiful aerial solos of
the two stars. They don’t
rest and, even during the
interval, they remain in
character, interacting with
the audience in a way
that prevents the mood of
Hades from dissipating.
The other stand-out
aspect of the perfor-
mance is the music. The
original score, created
by Sam West, captures
Persephone’s tragic mel-
ancholy and the darkness
and terror of Hades. It’s
rendered all the more
effective by the live per-
formance from West and
fellow performer Becks
Johnstone, whose operatic
voice perfectly captures
the eerie melancholy of
this particular version of
Hades.
Despite its flaws, there
is a lot to be said for
Becoming Shades: it’s
certainly different from
standard theatre or circus
and there is a uniqueness
to the experience that
can’t be overstated. If
you fancy an immersive
performance and want to
try something different,
it’s a show that wont leave
you feeling disappointed.
Part theatre, part circus, Becoming Shades isn’t perfect, but it’s an experience that will leave you in awe.
stray from the story it is
supposed to be telling.
For the bulk of the per-
formance, the links to the
myth are loose and the
references to it are often
hard to grasp beyond
the overall themes and
aesthetic; this is a show

BECOMING SHADES
ISIS, 4Chan, and WhatsApp: Theatre for the Lulz
For a play examining the radicalisation of young men, Javaad Alipoor’s production finds an innovative way to
bring its audience together.
T
he Believers Are
But Brothers
opens at the Bush
Theatre, after an
award-winning run at the
Edinburgh Fringe in 2017.
It tells the stories of three
young men who, through
their encounters online,
become exposed to and
enveloped by the murky
waters of extremism.
Two of the stories follow
young British Muslims;
Atif from the south coast
who travels to Syria to
join ISIS and Marwan,
from the ‘post-industrial
North’, who volunteers
to join an aid convoy to
Syria. The third story
follows Ethan, a 21-year
old white man from
California, obsessed with
4Chan and the alt-right.
The Believers is un-
doubtedly timely though
strangely one of the only
pieces of theatre willing
to tackle radicalisation
in all forms head-on.
But what makes the play
truly unique, is its use of
WhatsApp. Prior to the
show-day, an email was
sent out to attendees,
encouraging them to sign
up to a WhatsApp group
to ‘enhance your experi-
ence’. On the outset, this
appeared to be a small
quirk of the show, perhaps
even a gimmick. But as
the play progressed, it
became clear that being
a member of the group
was not only essential to
follow the narrative, but
allowed for the audience
to engage with a piece of
theatre in a completely
new and exciting manner.
Billed as a one-man
play, the produc-
tion actually features two
actors, both of whom are
critical to it success. The
first – the ‘Performer’ – is
Jvaad Alipoor, the play’s
writer and co-director. It is
Alipoor alone that speaks
to the audience and recites
the stories of The Be-
lievers. The second – the
‘Operator’ – is a mute at a
keyboard, lingering in the
murk of cold-blue com-
puter light at the back of
the stage, played by Luke
Emery. His role is operate
the technical aspects of
The Believers; which
primarily involves send-
ing WhatsApp messages
to the Believers group.
It would be easy for
this play to take aim at
social media and the
role of the internet in
radicalising young men.
and had the play been
written by an outsider to
internet culture looking
in, I fear the play may
have hit such a dud note.
Thankfully, Alipoor is
as qualified a playwright
for The Believers as one
could hope for: by his
own admission, a fan of
encryption-based mes-
saging and a young man
who has connected with
numerous new people
online. Alipoor is also a
British Muslim, frustrated
by the media narrative sur-
rounding his community,
a narrative that he: a. does
not recognise and b. is not
allowed to partake in. He
is a Bradford native, serv-
ing as Artistic Director for
the Northern Lines theatre
company that works with
communities in the city
who do not normally
engage with theatre.
Alipoor delivers
each story in segments,
alternating his position
on-stage for each and
regularly breaking the
fourth wall during transi-
tions, to comment on the
proceedings or provide
background to the peculi-
arities of 4Chan.Although
never quite acting per se,
Alipoor is a truly excellent
storyteller. His recounting
of the characters’ tales
is delivered with such
emboldened conviction
that each story takes on
a life of its own, distinct
from others not just in its
content, but in the Alipoor
who tells it. On their own,
the stories are compelling.
At the play’s climax,
however, Alipoor ties the
lives of Atif, Marwan, and
Ethan together in a spec-
tacular sequence fitting for
such a bold piece of work.
Fitting too, that in a
play that discusses meme
culture and the serious is-
sues of racism and misog-
yny that stem from it, the
play is able to switch from
humour to sombreness on
a dime. Midway through
the play, Alipoor asks the
WhatsApp group, ‘What’s
the weirdest thing you’ve
seen on the internet?’.
Cue the chorus of notifi-
cation pings and audience
chuckles as the accounts
of witnessing strange porn
flow in. Then, a user by
the name of ‘Forthelulz’
chimes in, “Fucking
whiney feminists….”
he begins, and proceeds
to message half a dozen
grotesque paragraphs
about rape and murder,
drawing gasps from the
crowd. Of course, the
account is under the con-
trol of Emery and despite
most, one imagines, in
the crowd being aware of
this it puts an immediate
end to the audience’s
messages and laughter.
So too, the play’s
comparison of the radical-
isation processes of ISIS
and the alt-right is poign-
ant, not because of their
differences but because of
their shocking similarity.
To quote one of Alipoor’s
online acquaintances, a
gay Rabbi from Alabama,
“If you’re a bigot when
you pick the book up
you’ll be a bigot when
you put the book down.”
Interspersed be-
tween the stories and
audience engagement,
Alipoor delivers a fourth
narrative; the conception
of ISIS from its roots in
1950s Egypt, through to
Al-Qaeda and Osama bin
Ladin, and eventually
its founder and leader
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
Although these stories are
delivered with the same
distinctive Alipoor flair,
they fail to add anything
significant to the overall
plot of the play, and time
would have been better
spent with the ‘brothers’.
In the play’s final act,
Alipoor sends a speech
to the WhatsApp group,
one sentence at a time, the
goal being that a random
member of the audience
will read the line aloud for
the room to hear before the
next is sent. Ironic, then,
that in a play focusing
entirely on young men,
the vast majority of voices
to read aloud are those of
women.
In his Foreword to the
play’s script, Madani
Younis, Artistic Director
at the Bush Theatre
comments that “This
is not an echo chamber
play.” Sure, Alipoor has
written a play focusing
on two tiny subsections
of society, but they’re
two subsections that
have a disproportionate
impact on the news and
content that everyone in
the western world – men,
women, Muslim, secular
– engages with and reacts
to online. And away from
the play’s portrayal of the
most extreme of extreme
groups, it provides a com-
mentary on the larger role
of social media in society;
its ability accelerate the
transfer of ideas - good
and bad – and bring total
strangers together.
The theatre is normally
a reserved environement;
audiences sit in reverence
and pitch blackness,
honouring the work of
the actors before them.
The Believers shows that
it is possible to appre-
ciate and engage with a
performance in spite of a
cacophony of phones and
constant flaring of screens.
Never have I felt so con-
nected to those around me
during a play. Rare is it
that a play can prove to be
as thought-provoking for
its means of delivery as its
story, acting and message.
Rarer still is it to find a
play that, although not
perfect, is unequivocally a
must-see.
