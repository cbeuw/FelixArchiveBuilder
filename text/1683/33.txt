Immortals squeeze past the Pythons
T
he Immortals
reignited their
season in a
thrilling contest
at Cambridge that went
to double-overtime, con-
demning their hosts to a
fourth straight defeat.
In a sport where
rosters frequently have
30+ players at university
level, an injury-ravaged
Imperial took a squad of
19 to Cambridge, soon
reduced to 18 with an
unfortunate injury in
warmups.
Unfazed by being
outnumbered, Imperial
dominated on both sides
of the ball in the opening
half. The Immortals
defense stifled the
Python’s running game,
with Jacob “more MVPs
than socials” Lamb and
Dom “have you heard my
mixtape?” DeSilva giving
the opposing running
backs no room to breathe.
The revamped offense
also took the game to
Cambridge, with Ben
“skips first and goes for
the home run” O’Brien,
Harry “NaCl” Lawrence
and Tom “Mr chripse
your ex” Smith consist-
ently carving through.
Lawrence would find the
fensive line were winning
the battle in the trenches,
with veteran Daniel “4
more years” Grumberg
leading the way.
The second half saw
the Pythons bite back,
however. An error on
special teams lead to
excellent field position
for Cambridge for the
opening drive of the third
quarter, who duly convert-
ed it into a touchdown of
their own to tie the game
at 6-6.
The Immortals would
reply with a big drive of
their own, driving the ball
to the Pythons’ goal line.
To their credit, Cambridge
stepped up their game, and
a big goal line stand would
keep the scores even as
the Imperial offense failed
to punch it in.
Inexperience and a lack
of numbers began to take
its toll on Imperial as the
game wore on, however
the desire to win was still
there as the Immortals
continued to make big
plays. One highlight was
Anuj “loses to green boi”
Mehra putting a crunching
hit on their key player, a
move that rejuvenated the
whole Immortals squad.
And it was in dou-
ble-overtime where the
Immortals would strike.

with Lukas “nickname
not appropriate for Felix”
Hann to send the Imperial
side line into rapture.
The teams will meet
again at Harlington in two
weeks’ time.

Imperial 1st
XV lose to Brunel in tough contest
L
ast Wednesday
marked the return
of ICURFC 1st
XV to rugby
after Christmas, in which
they took on Brunel
University. Following
a close loss to Brunel
in November, last time
these teams met, Imperial
were determined not to
let history repeat itself.
The cold, windy and wet
conditions at Harlington
couldn’t dampen our spir-
its. We started strongly,
and our forwards were
able to truck the ball up
into Brunel’s 22. Quick
hands from flyhalf Harry
Allingham allowed Alex
Amato to run over for
an easy try. With James
Field’s conversion we
were 7-0 up early in the
game. Dropped balls and
poor discipline prevented
us from gaining attacking
momentum for the rest of
the first half. Brunel kept
got up and turned over the
ball after making a tackle.
Brunel’s talkative inside
centre was also soon intro-
duced to the ground when
he tried to run through
Isaac Bailey and was, less
than politely, made to sit
down. Unfortunately, our
eager defence gave away
a penalty for being offside
and Brunel made the score
7-3 from the tee.
The second half started
exactly how the first half
hadn’t. The team had
switched off. Holes in
defence started to appear
and IC failed to keep
possession of the ball.
This allowed Brunel to
score two tries in quick
succession, making the
score 7-15. However, all
hope was not yet lost. Line
breaks and Big Carries
from Big T, Big Nate
and Big Shuz inspired
the team to turn the game
around. Connor Gilligan
came off the bench and
made an immediate
impact by picking up one
of Brunel’s players and
dangling him off the floor
like a child, legs flailing
and all. After many, many
phases of play, five metres
from Brunel’s try line,
Toby was finally able to
penetrate Brunel and score
a try. The score was now
12-15 with five minutes
left to play. Momentum
started to build for us and
Brunel were tiring, but
ultimately, we had left it
too late. The final whistle
blew, and a tired Imperial
team left Harlington
knowing they could have
done more. Fortunately,
the weather cleared up in
evening, and the entirety
of ICURFC was able to
tee off for a round of pub
golf in some of London’s
finest drinking holes. By
the time we reached The
Slug, the afternoon’s bad
memories had almost
been forgotten.
