Amazing grace: John thrills at the National Theatre
W
e are intro-
duced to
P u l i t z e r -
w i n n i n g
playwright Annie Baker’s
new play, John, by Mertis.
Playing the aging propri-
etor of an Gettysburg bed
& breakfast, Marylouise
Burke, whose sense of
comedic timing is impec-
cable, draws back the red
velvet stage curtains with
slow arthritic movements.
In a scene that faintly
recalls the infamous
Victoria Wood sketch
in which Julie Walters
plays a elderly waitress
unable to balance soup,
we watch Mertis light
various table lamps, dust
her vast collection of
knick-knacks and make
her way up the stairs to
the rooms on the first
floor, all in preparation for
the guests who will soon
arrive. The scene, which
is several minutes long, is
a masterclass in naturalis-
tic acting, and ingenious
writing – it takes place
in near silence, and for a
good portion of the time
the stage is empty, save
for dozens of dolls that
stare out into the audience
with unblinking glass
eyes – we can only guess
at Burke’s movements by
the sound of her footsteps
in the rafters. From these
first moments, in a cast of
immensely capable actors,
Burke is the runaway
star. She commands the
stage with her soft spoken
voice and deliberate, quiet
grace.
Eventually we meet Eli
(Tom Mothersdale) and
Jenny (Anneika Rose),
a New York couple that
come to stay at Mertis’
B&B. Though at first they
seemingly appear happy
and in love, we soon see
that their relationship
is on the rocks, despite
their best efforts. We
hear snatches of argu-
ments floating down the
stairs on their first night,
and then rapidly their
disagreements spill out
into the public. Just as
the heating in their room
will not switch on, the
chill in their relationship
refuses to thaw. Hamfisted
attempts by the two to
draw the other out lead
to escalations: when at
his behest Jenny tries
to be candid about her
disgust at Eli slurping
cereal, he accuses her of
anti-semitism: “Like, oh
Jesus, the big loud hairy
Jew is like smacking his
lips again and chewing
with his mouth open and
it’s totally repulsive.”
Nothing will convince
him that that is not what
she meant.At times it feels
claustrophobic watching
these desperate, intimate
arguments on the cluttered
stage because they sound
so real. Bakers has such an
uncanny talent for writing
dialogue, her characters
stop and start when they
go to talk, bumble through
what they say, the writing
is so precise it sounds
improvised: it is easy
to wonder what these
real-life people are doing
up on stage.
Baker’s writing is
cleverinotherways:“have
you ever felt watched?”
Mertis asks Jenny over
a glass of wine towards
the end of the second act.
Jenny looks out into the
audience where hundreds
of pairs of eyes intently
look back. “No,” she says
“I don’t think so.” After
a pause, she revises her
answer, admitting that she
had always felt judged
by a childhood doll who
to her seemed furious at
her. To Mertis’ friend,
Genevieve, played by a
fantastic June Watson,
this seems entirely
natural. “Of course she
was angry!” she exclaims,
“to be a piece of plastic...
to be shaped into a human
form and trapped! People
manhandling you. And
then put in a dress. Put
in an itchy little dress!”
This scene in which the
three exceptional female
leads sit around a table
discussing their lives
reveals John as quietly
feminist – of course these
women know what it is to
be angry at being objecti-
fied, how could they not?
Baker’s frequent
allusions to being
watched echoes Margaret
Atwood’s The Robber
Bride, in which Atwood
writes that that everything
a woman does, “including
not catering to male fan-
tasies, is a male fantasy:
...pretending you have a
life of your own... uncon-
scious of the ever-present
watcher peering through
the keyhole, peering
through the keyhole in
your own head, if nowhere
else”. Atwood’s words
“you are a woman with
a man inside watching a
woman” are never truer
than in the case of Ge-
nevieve, an elderly blind
woman who for many
years had felt her ex-hus-
band had control of her
mind and was dictating
her every action.
Baker’s writing finds a
perfect partner in director
James MacDonald, whose
approach is considered
and cinematic. Over the
course of nearly three and
a half hours, he allows
Baker’s characters to
evolve gradually, occupy-
ing the stage at the edges,
or sometimes not at all,
making the events that
much closer, more real.
Baker’s meditations on
loneliness, and our power
to acutely and precisely
hurt those we know the
best are powerful. The
only missteps she makes
are in her conscious effort
to be spooky: Christmas
lights flicker ominously,
there are references to
quasi-sentient rooms; all
of this is unnecessary,
John is haunting enough
without the addition
of actual ghosts. This
singular, brilliant play
cements Baker’s position
as one of the best, most
interesting playwrights
working today.
The story of a failing relationship in a possibly haunted B&B is a showcase of playwright Annie Baker’s genius.
