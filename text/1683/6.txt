Grumpy Bastard turns his gaze to cycling in the big smoke. And he now hates more people
than ever before.

T
his week, I have
begun to cycle
more. I’m a big
fan of cycling be-
cause one of my favourite
people in the whole of the
UK is a large advocate
of it. Yes, he might break
ranks in the Tory cabinet
and tell outright lies, but
at least his hair looks
fantastic perched on top of
his head, like immaculate
thatch on a traditional
British cottage. I could
almost write dedicated
love poetry for Bo Jo, but
I’d certainly feel like I was
cheating on the King of
the Tories, or as he would
prefer it, Rex Cuntz. Rees-
Mogg and his charmingly
elitist outlook is what gets
me out of bed in the morn-
ing – if only to realise that
my parents aren’t wealthy
enough for me to ever
get a better bed or indeed
even aspire to a better bed.
However, it is not for me
to question the wisdom
of the class system, as it
did spawn the greatest
Empire that humanity has
ever witnessed, on which
the Sun Never Set and
the Screaming Never
Stopped. It definitely had
a net positive effect on hu-
manity in general, unless
of course you count the
poor bastards that were
busy being exploited/
murdered/enslaved for the
good of the mother coun-
try, and, somehow, they
are conveniently easy to
ignore. It is also critical
to remember that inequal-
ity is only real when we
talk about it: the less it’s
mentioned, the more
likely it is that the dumb
fuckers that make up the
modern-day peasantry
will continue rutting in the
dirt without a care in the
world. Best to keep it on
the low down, otherwise
they might do something
about it and that would be
disastrous. No one wants
another 1917.
Anyway, to return
from my eulogy to those
greatest of men and
woman that make up
our ruling aristocracy,
I have started cycling
more, and I have only
one observation to report.
The bane of cyclists is
not left turning buses or
pedestrians that fail to
hear you approaching and
simply step out into the
middle of the road with
all the care of a Samurai
charging Gatling guns.
It is instead people that
drive very large cars. For
some reason, probably a
superiority complex, these
people drive these vessels
without paying attention
to their surroundings, and
when their surroundings
rudely intrude on their
serene progress through-
out the cramped streets
of London, their sole
response is to gesticulate
violently, before headbut-
ting the horn and volubly
exclaiming, “get off the
road, you wanker.” My
reasoning for this response
is that they are not used
to having to interact
with poor people such as
myself except when my
person is being crushed
between their Land Rover
with four-wheel drive
and some railings. I am
almost convinced that
the only reason that they
fail to go through with
crushing me to death is
that they don’t want to
have to clean the blood
off their car. As a defence
mechanism, it’s not much,
but it certainly beats being
forced to become some
sort of human mashed
potato. In fact, it’s almost
like that lizard that squirts
blood out of their eyes
to confuse their enemy.
That is my final defence
mechanism: stay away or
I’ll bleed on you.
Therefore, I’d like to
offer some upgrades that
could make this defence
mechanism completely
obsolete. As far as I’m
aware, there are not very
many options, as the
whole idea is to minimise
the risk of mess. My first
idea is to attach heated
Boadicea blades that
would instantaneously
cauterise the wound. Yes,
it would make the car a
little wider, but I don’t
think that has ever been a
consideration that has put
you off before. Secondly,
similarly to the red flag
men that walked in front
of the car, you could utilise
some plebs of your own
to run alongside and beat
any unwanted cyclists to
death. Minimise the mess
to yourself and further the
cause of the class system
by setting the Third Estate
against one another.
