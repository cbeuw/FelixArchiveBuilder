Organs-on-Chips – A catalyst for drug testing?

The FDA and research groups collaborate with Emulate Inc. to evaluate the ability of Organs-on-Chips to speed
up the drug testing process.
A
ccording to the
World Health
Organization
( W H O ) ,
antibiotic resistance in
bacteria is one of the
biggest threats to global
health today. Bacteria
gaining resistance is a
natural process, but this
has been accelerated by
the misuse of medicines.
The consequence of this
is that bacteria remain
unaffected by our current
medications, leading to
longer stays in the hospi-
tal, greater medical costs
and increased mortality.
The way to combat antibi-
otic resistance in bacteria
is to develop new drugs
that can kill them. The
drug development process
set by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) is
a long and costly process,
coupled with uncertainty
on whether a new drug
will actually succeed to
the next stage.
While this ensures the
medicines you use are
safe, the downside is that
it can take decades for
a drug to finally reach
the shelf of your local
pharmacy. To accelerate
the process, scientists and
engineers across disci-
inside a research system
similar to a computer. The
instrument is designed to
recreate the environment
of the human body, such
as airflow. Medicines,
FDA announced that they
are entering a multi-year
research and development
agreement with Emulate
Inc. They will be evaluat-
ing their Organs-on-Chips
(OOCs) technology to
check if they can be
used in the drug testing
process. There are three
components to OOCs:
Organ-chips, instrumenta-
tion and apps.
The organ-chips are
the size of an AA battery.
They are lined with living
human cells and have
microfluidic channels that
can allow the flow of air
or blood, just like in the
human body. The chips are
flexible, allowing motions
like breathing or muscle
contraction to be simulat-
ed. They are also transpar-
ent, allowing researchers
to analyse the organ’s
functionality, behavior
and response at a cellular
level. Some examples of
OOCs include: Blood-
vessel-chips, liver-chips,
lung-chips, etc.
OOCs are placed
them.
Apps help provide
precise control of an
OOC’s living microenvi-
ronment and configure the
cell architecture amongst
other functions.
Recently, a team of
researchers from the
Division of Hemostasis
and Thrombosis at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical
Center (BIDMC) col-
laborated with the Wyss
Institute and discovered,
using a blood-vessel-on-
a-chip, small molecules
called parmodulins. They
provide anti-inflammatory
and antithrombotic pro-
tection to endothelial cells
without interfering with
the blood clotting process.
This property makes par-
modulins good candidates
for new drugs. Through
this study, one can see
how OOCs can accelerate
the safer development and
evaluation of drugs.
Wyss Institute founding
director Dr Donald Ingber
also proposed that OOCs
can replace animal testing
early in the drug devel-
opment process to ensure
greater efficacy and safety.
One of the main problems
with animal testing is that
the drugs are tested in cells
that don’t function exactly
like those in the human
body. Hence, researchers
need to do extensive
experiments to check for
potential side-effects in
humans, which can take
many months. According
to the Nature journal,
85% of drugs fail in early
clinical trials due to this.
Dr Ingber proposed that
by injecting drugs into
an OOC, researchers
can analyse the effects
of the drug on human
tissue itself at an early
stage without poten-
tially harming humans.
However, while animals
can shed light on how the
drug can affect behavior,
OOCs only show physio-
logical effects of the drug
on a small group of cells.
If OOCs are to become
the next-generation
method of drug devel-
opment and research in
various industries, they
need to be able to be
mass-manufactured and
automated, ensuring
that they are produced
continuously with quality
control. Up till now, they
have been manufactured
in small batches to be used
in academic research.
Earlier this month,
Harvard published a study
in the journal Biofabrica-
tion that described a new,
faster method for manu-
facturing hearts-on-chips.
Dr Lisa Scudder, co-lead
author of the study, said:
“Our new heart-on-a-chip
fabrication method uses
a UV laser to pattern the
hydrogel, employing
riboflavin to sensitise the
gel for optical ablation…
[This] creates features on
the gel much faster, but
with the same resolution
and reproducibility, as
traditional moulding tech-
niques.”
Dr Janna Nawroth, the
co-lead author, added that
the process is scalable,
60% faster than the old
process, and gives uni-
formity without altering
the hydrogel properties.
This makes the technol-
ogy a step closer to mass
production and use by
pharmaceutical compa-
nies.
Though OOCs are not
yet ready to be mass-pro-
duced and distributed,
good progress has been
made in showcasing its
potential in drug-test-
ing, suggesting a more
efficient future for the
process.

Yes, that’s an organ // Harvard
plines are collaborating to
find new drugs and drug
testing methods. One such
group is Emulate Inc.,
a Wyss Institute (from
Harvard University) start-
up.
In April of last year, the
chemicals and other toxins
can be introduced into the
chip via the instrument
and the effect of them on
the cells lining the chip
can be analysed due to
the modular nature of the
system. OOCs can also be
connected together using
the instrument to better
understand the interac-
tions between different
organs and the effect of
foreign substances on
