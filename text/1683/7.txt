W
hat a great
time to be
an Imperial
s t u d e n t .
We have finally beaten
Oxbridge at some ranking!
What is it? Student satis-
faction? Employability?
Innovation? It doesn’t
matter! We beat them!
Except it does matter.
Enormously. According
to a UCAS report, we
have overtaken Oxford
and Cambridge to become
the UK’s most unequal
university. We have the
lowest proportion of
students coming from
low-income areas in the
UK compared to any other
university in the country.
Let’s be honest, though.
This was never a secret.
We all study or work here,
we don’t need any report
to tell us what we already
know. Imperial is a bastion
of privileged education.
And funnily enough,
if I understand the data
correctly, the report only
focuses on UK students,
sorting them from low-in-
come to high-income
based on the areas where
they went to school. It
would be interesting
to publish some sort of
Gini coefficient based on
data from Home, EU and
overseas students, even if
the results are more than
predictable: if Imperial
is the most international
university in the UK, and
considering the fees paid
by overseas students,
it’s easy to infer how
much more unequal this
university might be. And
it might get worse in the
future. Brexit is coming
very soon, meaning EU
students will probably
start to classify as general
overseas students, jacking
up their fees and removing
their Student Finance.
I don’t have a problem
with studying surrounded
by rich people. That’s
not an issue in itself. It
can bring up some side
issues, like the fact that if
you grow up in a wealthy
bubble you can end up out
of touch with the rest of
society’s problems. But
this is always avoidable if
your intentions are good
enough and you put in a
bit of effort.
The real issue is pro-
viding society with equal
opportunities for students
from every background to
have a shot at studying at
a world class university.
An interesting thought
to consider is how the
average graduate job
destination would change
if Imperial weren’t that
wealthy. We already
know banking is the top
industry of choice for
Imperial undergraduates,
after health and social
work (because, you know,
medics). Would this fact
stay the same? On the one
hand, one would think that
students from high-in-
come families are, at
least stereotypically, more
pressured to succeed – the
expectations they have to
fulfil are higher compared
to someone who’s the first
in her family to attend
university. Their defini-
tion of success is shaped
by their surroundings (so
maybe earning less than
£40k just after graduating
won’t feel like enough).
On the other hand,
coming from a higher-in-
come family can provide
you a more effective
safety net after you
graduate, which means
it’s easier to refuse jobs
you don’t want and be a
bit more vocational, while
a lower-income student
might feel pressured to
take the first job they
come across.
These are all gener-
alisations of the choices
individuals make under
different circumstances,
but it’s always interesting
to consider what forces
are at play regarding
career decisions when
you come from different
backgrounds.
But going back to the
issue of equal opportu-
nities, we hear a lot of
talk referring to the high
grades needed to enter
Imperial, and the fact
that, on average, schools
from poorer areas tend to
achieve lower grades. This
is the problem with the
data: it’s hard to decouple
the problem of inequal-
ity at Imperial with the
problem of lower grades
from poorer backgrounds.
At first, it feels like the
solution lies in trying to
improve the conditions for
poorer students and come
up with strategies that
will improve their grades
during high-school. And
this is true to a certain
extent. But we can’t
ignore two facts: firstly,
that it’s harder to focus
on your grades when your
family is having a hard
time; secondly, that part
of the value proposition
of private schools is better
performance. As long as
A-levels remain a com-
petition, private schools
will fight to the death to
get their students up in the
performance charts.
It makes sense to
consider asking for
different grade require-
ments depending on your
background. But it’s not
the only option we have
to consider, and there is
a large debate to be had
over the fairness and
effectiveness of such an
approach.
brave souls get a part time
job to support the cost of
living. If they are able
to, for example, work at
the Union bars and not
have their performance at
university being affected
by it, they are absolute
heroes. Just overcoming
the accumulation of lack
of sleep after working
night shifts and being able
to finish their coursework
is a huge feat in itself.
And yet, most students
wouldn’t welcome a
big campus move to a
more suburban area. The
move is already arguably
happening for some parts
– postgraduates are being
moved in great numbers
to the White City campus,
and halls in Acton have
been up and running for
three years now. It does
seem like the longer-term
strategy involves moving
as much as we can out of
central London.
But we don’t want
to move. OK, I get it.
It’s nice to be in South
Kensington, surrounded
by museums and Hyde
Park. Gazing at a lit up
Natural History Museum
every night when I come
home from the library is a
beautiful sight I still can’t
get used to. But we have
to face the hard facts. The
price to pay for all these
privileges is studying in
the UK’s most unequal
university. And without an
eventual move of all the
campuses out of Central
London and into areas
such as Acton and White
City, Imperial’s inequality
will keep increasing. The
choice is hard, but a more
inclusive community with
equal opportunities is
something worth giving
up your privilege for.
Moving to areas like White City might help with the issue// Imperial College “The cost of
life in central
London has
to be driving
some of this
inequality”
For Imperial, however,
there are other approaches
that might help with the
issue which don’t involve
grades at all. Because it’s
not only a grades problem.
Imperial’s main campus is
in Kensington, which is
arguably one of the most
expensive neighbour-
hoods in all of Europe.
There is no way that’s
not a large deterrent when
low-income students
consider their applica-
tions. To go to lectures,
most undergraduates will
have to be happy paying
their £175/week or paying
a bit less, or alternately,
commuting for hours and
blowing all the money on
transport anyway.The cost
of life in central London
has to be driving some of
this inequality. OK, some

P
icture the scene:
you, a hot young
20-something in
university, are
invited to a dinner party
by a few members of
the opposite sex. They
instruct you to wear
something revealing and
tight, and even go so far
as to specify what sort
of underwear you should
have on. You go, and,
predictably, they are
flirtatious; proposition-
ing you, touching you,
and generally revelling
in lewd hedonism. Are
you surprised? Unless
you were brought up
under a rock, I would
imagine not.
This is the preface
to the now infamous
Annual Presidents Club
charity dinner, that took
place on the evening of
Thursday 18th at the plush
Dorchester hotel. It was a
male-only event, at which
130 ‘hostesses’ – young,
pretty girls – were given
instructions to dress in
a manner identical to
those in our hypothetical
scenario: they were told
to wear “skimpy black
outfits with matching un-
derwear and high heels….
black sexy shoes”. The
Financial Times went
in undercover, exposing
bawdy male behaviour,
with roaming hands, out-
rageous comments, and
multiple propositions to
spend the night. Rightly,
there was a sentiment of
disgust at this behaviour.
Oddly, in my opinion,
there was also an attitude
of shock, and an overall
tone of victimisation on
the part of the women
involved.
Yes, the male guests
largely behaved like
pigs – but that doesn’t
mean that the women
were victims. Caroline
Dandridge, the woman
responsible for recruiting
the hostesses, informed
them in advance of the
nature of the evening,
banning them from
bringing phones, advising
them to lie to boyfriends
about whereabouts, and
telling them in advance
about the “annoying”
men after relaying the
aforementioned dress
code. Gross, I know – but
warning nonetheless.
These women knew what
they were doing, and
chose to do it anyway.
Some of them have done
the event for multiple
years, and the FT itself
admitted that some host-
esses interviewed viewed
the night as “fun”. Even
for those who didn’t, it is
absurd to want to believe
that they had absolutely
no idea what they were
going to be there for. They
were obviously and sick-
eningly invited as pieces
of meat, and were treated
accordingly. I think that
this behaviour, a seedy
underbelly of human
(mostly male) nature, is
despicable, and ever since
I first encountered people
with these attitudes at
school, I was revolted,
and I kept my distance.
But the rhetoric of
victimisation on the part
of the women is mis-
placed and exaggerated;
it jumps on to the recent
bandwagon of lurid men
abusing innocent women,
and ignores the reality of
the choices these women
– rightly or wrongly –
made. Consider a differ-
ent scenario: a man going
to visit an escort, or going
into a strip club. Are the
men who generally do this
boorish and lascivious?
Absolutely. Is the woman
in question a victim? Of
course not. She made
a choice to participate,
and her actions are her
own. I see no reason why
these hostesses, who, by
all accounts, were well
informed, should be
treated as victims.
I was also puzzled
by the general attitude
of surprise; that this
behaviour is deplorable is
immutably true, but that
it is uncommon is not,
and I expect most of us
know it. It is an attitude
that pervades many soci-
eties, especially Western
society, which considers
itself enlightened and
progressive. Lauded
establishments such as
the Cafe De Paris, where
women dance half-naked
but it is called cabaret,
rather than stripping, are
considered artsy, chic, and
any other word people
like to use to justify their
attendance, and to substi-
tute ‘salacious’.
People – mostly
pleasure. The adult
entertainment industry,
scavenging on the liberal
rhetoric of freedom of
expression, instructs its
patrons from a young age
that people are objects for
your pleasure. Whilst I am
disgusted by this, and the
culture of objectification
taken to an extreme by
those attendants at the
Presidents Club, I have
been disgusted by it for
some time. That a bunch
of rich men get together to
be gross is not a surprise
— it’s strange that people
keep pretending it is.
There are consequences
of the choices made by
society, of the things it
deems appropriate and
the boundaries it consid-
ers acceptable to cross.
Western culture has no
problem with pictures of
half-naked women on the
walls of the tube, or the
front of a magazine. And
yet, it seems shocked to
discover that, predictably,
this encourages a culture
of objectification and
lewdness.
The Presidents Club
Dinner was an unfortu-
nate event, demonstrating
that there are a good pro-
portion of men who are
gross, objectifying, badly
behaved and lecherous -
but this is not news. And
yes, the men are horrid,
but that doesn’t make
the women victims, and
if they choose to engage
in this sort of work, they
sit in the same boat with
a society that inculcates
objectification. If people
are genuinely shocked,
and genuinely want this
attitude to change, perhaps
an introspective look at
the practices and values
of their society would be
prudent.
“The male
guests largely
behaved like
pigs – that
doesn’t mean
the women
were victims”
men – all over the world
behave like this, and
many institutions in our
society fuel them. Adver-
tising encourages us to
think about people solely
as objects, and we call
someone who takes their
clothes off to be objecti-
fied a ‘model’, cementing
our justification of their
presence as non-human
gratification machines;
television is rampant
with over-exaggerated
nudity and an obsession
with the way people
look; magazines show off
shirtless men and bikinied
women, using the word
‘empowered’ to make us
forget that, choice or no,
they are presenting people
as objects for viewing
