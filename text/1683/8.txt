nakes, spiders
and scorpions are
probably some
of the animals
that come to mind when
you think of the word
venom. There is a wide
range of other venomous
animals too – including
the platypus, jellyfish,
and, surprisingly, two
species of frogs! To be
clear, venom is a toxin
that requires a delivery
system such as a stinger
or a fang. Venoms are
often confused with poi-
sons which conversely
have to be ingested for
their effects to be deadly.
The paradox with
venom is that while it can
cause harm, it can also
do some good! Recent
research has shown it
may provide a potential
cure to diseases such as
cancer. As someone who
has been fascinated with
venomous animals since
a young age, I took the
opportunity to visit an
exhibition at the Natural
different purposes. For
example, snakes and cone
shells share the use of
venom as a tool for preda-
tion; bees and wasps use
it as a defensive mecha-
nism; and it also allows
for easier blood feeding
for vampire bats! There
are numerous diverse
delivery mechanisms and
functions of venom within
the animal kingdom,
and many of these were
highlighted in the exhibit.
As much as I enjoyed the
initial hall, where you are
introduced to different
animal groups and how
their venoms differ, I
feel that plants were left
out for the single reason
that they do not generate
much interest. Yet plants
are venomous! Just think
about stinging nettles and
their Australian cousin
the ‘gympie-gympie’
– a nettle on steroids!
Although plant venom
cannot kill you, it can
cause you intense pain, so
much so that you to wish
it had.
Other halls looked at
the effects on the human
body, and the cures for
venom. This is an area I
find interesting, particu-
larly how our understand-
ing of venom has changed
over time, as well as the
treatment! I would recom-
mend visiting the exhibi-
tion if you, like me, have
an interest in the natural
world and the world of
venom systems. The fact
that the museum is only
a couple of doors down
from the South Kensing-
ton campus makes it par-
ticularly inviting! If you
are planning on going, it
does cost to enter – but
fear not: the National
History Museum has
a special discount
for Imperial College
students, so make sure to
show your student card
on entry. The exhibition
is only around until the
13th
May, so do not leave
it too long to visit if you
intend to!

How do you solve a problem like planetary mass?

hen Pluto
was down-
graded from
being called
a planet, it made you
ponder over the criteria
for the classification of
a planetary object. In
reality, the proper defini-
tion of a planet is more
important than just the
semantics. It can provide
astronomers finding new
celestial objects with a
basis of classification,
thus making it easier to
identify if the object under
investigation is a planet
or not. This distinction is
important for scientists as
it provides indirect ways
of inferring properties of
those “planets” by using
ideal comparisons with
closer, and easier to ob-
serve, planets.
Kevin Schlaufman, an
astrophysicist at Johns
Hopkins University, has
proposed an upper limit on
the mass of space objects
that qualify as a “planet”.
According to his most
recent study, this upper
bound of a mass should
be between four and ten
times the mass of Jupiter.
However, this is only an
exclusionary criterion,
disqualifying anything
heavier than that as a
planet. Anything lower in
weight would need further
investigation in order
to classify. This finding
is significant because
it helps to distinguish a
very large planet from a
brown dwarf – an object
whose mass lies between
that of a very large planet
and a star. These are
self-luminescent, and
hotter than a planet due
to deuterium and lithium
fusion, but they are
not massive enough to
support the nuclear fusion
of protium (hydrogen).
According to Schlaufman,
the current classification
is insufficient and leaves
ambiguity in results.
He proposed another
criterion to settle the
debate: the chemical
make-up of the closest
stars. This argument
roots from the process
of the formation of stars.
The giant planets such as
Jupiter form from a bot-
tom-up process – a rocky
base is built, which is then
enveloped by a gaseous
atmosphere. Since planets
analysed 146 planetary
systems and inferred a
few facts about space
objects: those greater
than ten times the size
of Jupiter are seldom
found near these heavy
metal enriched stars who
provide resources for
their development. Thus,
any celestial object lying
above the upper limit
identified should be cate-
gorised as a brown dwarf
as opposed to a planet.
Though this may end up
opening a fierce debate –
similar to the exclusion
of Pluto as a planet from
our solar system – but
the development of a
robust definition eases
the identification of new
planets and their study. As
our picture of the universe
gets bigger, a more
methodical definition is
required to help provide a
clearer view.

“Another
criterion for
deciding class
is the chemical
make-up of
closest stars”
But the brown dwarf
forms due to gravitational
instability which leads
to the mass of clouds to
collapse over itself. This
process is like the forma-
tion of a star.
So how do the planetary
limits become relevant?
Well, Schlaufman

A novel tool for the future of heart repair
Biomechanical mapping provides useful information for regenerating lost heart tissue due to heart attack.
H
eart attacks
cause the heart
to be tempo-
rarily starved
of blood flow and oxygen
due to a blockage in the
coronary arteries, which
deliver oxygen-rich blood
to the heart. This block-
age leads to scar tissue
within the heart. As we
age, this damage is often
deemed irreversible due
to the heart’s inability to
replace damaged tissue
with regenerated healthy
tissue. The irreversibility
of this tissue damage af-
fects the daily life of heart
attack survivors, reducing
the heart’s efficiency in
pumping blood to the rest
of the body. When mus-
cles do not receive enough
oxygenated blood, heart
attack survivors can feel
fatigue or shortness of
breath, among other unfa-
vourable sensations. More
seriously, scar tissue in the
heart can lead to conges-
tive heart failure or dilated
cardiomyopathy – both of
which are fatal conditions.
For the researchers at the
University of Houston
– in collaboration with
the Baylor College of
Medicine and the Texas
Heart Institute – finding a
method to reverse damage
to the heart tissue follow-
ing a heart attack has been
their primary aim. They
have recently gotten one
step closer to their goal by
using an optical technique
to compare the mechanical
properties of healthy heart
tissue with damaged heart
tissue in mice models,
which they plan to use to
test the effectiveness of
regeneration techniques.
In the first study of its
kind, Kirill V. Larin of

and James F. Martin of
the Baylor College of
Medicine used a technique
known as OCE – optical
coherence elastography,
developed in Larin’s lab
– to map the mechanical
properties of the heart.
OCE is based on optical
coherence tomography, a
high-resolution biomed-
ical imaging technique.
As MRI and ultrasound
both provide information
about tissue mechanics on
a larger scale than neces-
sary to image mice hearts,
OCE was deemed most
appropriate for use. OCE
has nanoscale sensitivity,
and its resolution is ideal
in determining if healthy
tissues begin replacing
scar tissue due to therapy.
tissue exhibit different re-
sponses to the mechanical
stimulation. Based on the
responses of healthy tissue
versus damaged tissue,
the researchers were able
to develop mathematical
models to represent the
biomechanical properties
of the cells.
Larin and Martin
induced heart attacks in
mice, then waited six
weeks for scar tissue to
form before excising
the hearts to perform
OCE. This enabled them
to gather information
regarding the mechanical
properties of healthy
tissue versus scar tissue.
During the ex-vivo study,
the hearts were soaked
in potassium chloride
to ensure a uniform
that the muscle fibres in
the damaged tissue were
stiffer and more disorgan-
ised than the fibres in the
healthy tissue. This was
deduced from the decrease
in elastic wave velocity,
natural frequency, and
anisotropy (directionality
dependent) reaction to the
wave propagation in the
damaged cells, respec-
tively.
Both researchers hope
to continue using OCE to
gather mechanical proper-
ties of regenerated tissue
in order to develop a cure
for scar tissue in the heart.
The scarring in the mouse
hearts is believed to be
similar to the scarring
that humans incur due to
heart attack, making this
method of mechanical
mapping applicable to the
over 75,000 people that
suffer a heart attack in the
UK every year.
“Irreversible
tissue damage

OCE is made up of
an imaging unit and an
air-pulse delivery unit
which involves very small
mechanical waves applied
to the heart tissue in the
form of low-pressure air
pulses. The amplitude of
the waves must be kept
very small in order to
not damage the cells, and
in this case small-scale,

nature of the mouse heart
