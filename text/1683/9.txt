The hidden side of psychedelics: an interview with
Professor David Nutt
P
rofessor David
Nutt has been at
Imperial since
2008, and has
long been a well-known
figure in the world of neu-
ropsychopharmacoloy. He
is the head of Imperial
College’s own Neuro-
psychopharmacology
Unit, of which the
Psychedelic Research
Group is a part. Sebastian
Gonzato caught up with
him to find out more about
what this group does.
What does the Psy-
chedelic Research
Group study and to
what end?
The group has been
around since even before
I arrived at Imperial,
and it has two aims – to
investigate the possible
therapeutic uses of psych-
edelics, as well as to un-
derstand the experience of
psychedelia. The latter is a
very old question indeed.
William James, a 19th
century American philos-
opher and psychologist,
famously wrote that “no
account of the universe in
its totality can exist that
leaves these [alterations of
consciousness] disregard-
ed”. The question then is
how to do so? Today we
have brain imaging so we
are able to, in a way, ‘look
inside people’s heads’ and
find out what’s happening.
And what effect do
psychedelics have on
the brain then?
All the psychedelics
we’ve investigated –
psilocybin, LSD and now
DMT – they all induce
what we’ve called ‘the
entropic state of the
brain’. The process of
learning involves your
brain becoming more
rigid, more constrained,
but psychedelics disrupts
our normal thought
patterns by making
connections in the brain
that aren’t usually there.
It’s this entropic state of
the brain that we believe
give psychedelics their
therapeutic value.
How so?
Take a disorder like
depression. People who
are depressed ruminate
over the same depressing
thoughts over and over
again, but psychedelics
can break these patterns.
We recently published a
study in October where
we gave 20 patients
with treatment-resistant
depression psilocybin
in a therapeutic setting.
They all experienced
a single trip, and all of
What are the chal-
lenges you face in
carrying out your
studies?
The psilocybin study
was in fact a safety
study, but we’re unable
to do any further studies
because psilocybin is
illegal. We’ve had the
study approved by an
ethics committee, but it’s
very difficult in the UK to
obtain the drug. In other
countries, as you may
know, this is not the case.
Psilocybin is legal (in
truffle form) in Holland
for example, and there’s
a huge industry in illegal
treatments using it.
That most psychedelics
are illegal is a real shame,
because we know from
our study and others
that they could be of
therapeutic use. There’s
a great amount of histor-
ical research into LSD for
example. The US govern-
ment funded 140 medical
studies into the drug, but
then this was stopped due
to the hippie movement
in the ‘60s when it was
made illegal. In fact, LSD
is the only drug which
was banned because it
changed the way people
voted, and the Republican
party was afraid of this.
We’ve started seeing
decriminalisation of drug
possession in some coun-
tries such as Portugal, but
we really need policies
that allow these drugs
to be studied and allow
doctors to decide whether
they should be prescribed
or not.

them experienced some
improvement in well-be-
ing immediately after. We
followed them up after
and found that about half
of them stayed better after
six months, while others
relapsed, so we are inter-
ested in finding out if a
prolonged treatment could
help them stay better.
