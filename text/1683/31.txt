Netflix and Hill
Cross Country & Athletics go for a mud bath at Ally Pally (no video streaming was involved).
O
n Wednesday
24th
January,
it was LSE’s
turn to host
the 4th
(and penultimate)
LUCA XC race of the
year at Alexandra Palace.
Leaving a rainy Beit at
1pm, 30+ dishevelled
Imperial students took the
Piccadilly line to Wood
Green before ascending
the long hill up to the
café at Ally Pally. Their
journey saw a long jump
over a deep puddle, some
serious elevation, and
a spectacular view of
London.
After the standard
pre-race bathroom trip
and wait for weather to
improve, the team de-
scended to the start line
where a mud bath awaited
them. Plastic bags were
immediately deployed in
an attempt to keep their
belongings dry. Alterna-
tively, belongings were
covered by jackets and
hung on trees; any attempt
to fight the harsh weather
conditions. Following a
for Men and two
laps/4.4km for Women.
Each lap saw a flat start,
a gradual incline, and a
rapid decline towards
the finish. The course
contained trail, concrete,
and grass but was mostly
mucky water.
It was classic XC.
For most of the runners
this was a tough and
lonely mental battle, with
little support along the
way, but this didn’t stop
them looking on the bright
side. There were comical
face-plants on show and
despite the somewhat
dangerous finish, students
managed to slide down
the hill greeted by roaring
cheers of delight.
First home for the
Imperial Men was 3rd
placed Oliver Newton in a
time of 24:29, followed by
6th
placed Harry Scriven
in 25:23 and Henry Hart
in 7th
with a time of 25:34.
Some other impressive
male performances
included Fergus Johnson
(26:39), Kyrill Mikhay-
lov (26:55), Charlie
McFadzean (26:59), and
Men’s Captain Lewis
Jackson (27:13), leaving
5th
Sarah Johnson (18:37),
6th
Kate Olding (18:50),
8th
Women’s Captain
Anna Lawson (19:15)
and 9th
Club Captain Alex
Mundell (19:20).
Following the success,
there was an impressive
mudslide performance,
compulsory cake con-
sumption and attempts to
clean up in dirty puddles
from Imperial’s athletes.
For some, a well-deserved
cheeky Nandos was in
order followed by an
uncomfortable tube ride
back to South Kensington
with lots of funny looks
from rather less muddy
members of the general
public. After quick but
soothing shower, the
runners continued the
celebrations for Karaoke
at the Chelsea Pensioner
with some quality singing
on display. Rumour has it
that there was an impres-
sive (and exclusive) 30-
minute performance from
a recently formed Oasis
tribute band – they are
set to release their cover
album soon.

quick ‘warm up’, lots of
optimism, and a beaming
team photo, they joined
100+ other students also
ready to tackle the tough
course which was approx-
imately three laps/6.6km
“It was a
successful day
for Imperial’s
Women, with
them retaining
their position
at the top of
the league”
them second in the LUCA
league just behind UCL.
It was a successful day
for Imperial’s Women
too, with them retaining
their position at the top of
the league but their lead
over UCL was cut from
9 points to just 4 with
one race to go! They had
4 strong top 10 finishers:
“Following
the success,
there was an
impressive
mudslide
performance
and cake
consumption”
Finally, the jovial
atmosphere diffused to
the Slug (where else?) – it
was a pleasure as always.
A day to remember for
ICXC.
