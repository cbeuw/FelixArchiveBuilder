Strike dates set across UK universities
NEWS
Strikes are set to
take place in 61
UK universities in
February and March,
afterdiscussionsfailed
to reach a resolution
on pension schemes.
M
embers of
the Uni-
versity and
C o l l e g e
Union (UCU) have an-
nounced a wave of strike
dates, after discussions
with Universities UK
(UUK) over pensions
ended without an agree-
ment.
Strikes are set to take
place over 14 days at 61
universities in the UK,
including Imperial. The
strikes will occur in esca-
lating waves, with the first
week seeing strikes from
22nd
-23rd
February and the
second week from 26th
-
28th
February; there will
then be a week’s break,
before a four-day strike
from 5th
-8th
March, and
finishing with a five-day
walkout from 12th
-16th
March.
Universities that have
reading weeks across
these dates will postpone
the strike for maximum
impact.
UCU members voted
largely in favour of in-
dustrial action, with 88%
of those balloted backing
a strike. 58.5% of UCU
Imperial members voted,
in line with the national
average of 58%. UCU
secretary general Sally
Hunt said: “[The results]
provide a very strong
mandate for UCU to con-
tinue the fight for a decent,
guaranteed pension.”
Talks were held last
week between UCU and
UUK – the group repre-
senting UK universities
– but ended without an
agreement being reached.
Hunt said they were “dis-
appointed at how talks
ended”, and said “staff
will feel utterly betrayed
by their leaders.”

President of Imperial
College UCU, told Felix:
