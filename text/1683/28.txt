IRISH SOCIETY –
DID SOMEONE SAY
CEILIDH?
Last Friday, Irish
Society went to The
Ceilidh Club in Camden.
It was an amazing night
filled with dancing,
alcohol, and sweat.
So, what is a ceilidh/
céilí? (I’ll get on to the
different spellings later)
The easiest definition is
that it’s the most fun you
can have on a Friday night
while still getting a decent
amount of sleep! It’s a
traditional form of dance
where you dance in either
a pair or small group with
a “caller” on the stage
telling you how to do
the moves. You’ll start
off slow, with the music
getting faster and faster
and everyone getting very
sweaty! There’s always
a real mix of abilities,
but the dances are easy
enough that even if you
have two left feet you
can easily follow. And
even if you do mess up,
so many other people will
also be making mistakes
that it won’t even matter.
Besides, most of the time
you’re fairly tipsy (or
very tipsy if you have
an alcohol tolerance like
mine) from going to the
pub beforehand or visiting
the bar downstairs for
sustenance, and most of
the other dancers will be
the same, so no one cares
if you mess up – really,
we recommend a bit of
freestyling.
For those of you who
don’t know, this fun event
is found in both Irish and
Scottish traditions, with
the Irish spelling céilí and
the Scots ceilidh. Tech-
nically speaking the one
in Camden is a Scottish
version with kilts and free
shortbread at the end, but
the actual dancing and
music is pretty much the
same. And who doesn’t
want free shortbread?
Admittedly, most
students aren’t initially
excited at the prospect of
attending a folk dancing
event. Which is fair
enough – many of our
members who had never
been to a ceilidh before
were incredibly sceptical
and took a lot of con-
vincing to attend our first
ceilidh last term. But all of
those who were uncertain
yet still came to our first
one, were among the first
to buy tickets when we
went again this second
time – and I think that
speaks for itself!
If you’re currently
feeling sad because
you’ve missed out on such
an amazing event – there’s
no need to worry, because
Irish Society will be going
to another ceilidh soon!
All the details are on our
Facebook page, and next
time we’ll be going to one
in South Kensington. To
add to all this excitement,
it will also be St Patrick’s
Day so this is an extra
excuse to join us for drinks
and dancing. Everyone is
welcome to come along,
whether you’re Irish,
Scottish, or just looking
to have a great night!
(But seriously, half of our
members aren’t even Irish
at all.)

KINKY KLUB –
IMPERIAL’S NEWEST
CSP
§
With more than 350
student clubs at Imperial,
it might seem that there
aren’t any interests not
catered to by a CSP. This
isn’t the case, however,
and each year sees the
creation of a number of
clubs, driven by pas-
sionate individuals who
guide their club from
conception to fruition.
One of the newest clubs
to be placed in the New
Activities Incubator is
Kinky Klub, described
as “a non-judgemental
place where you can ask
questions about the kinky
world we live in”. We sat
down with Chair Alexan-
dra Dakin to chat about
the story behind Kinky
Klub, and its increasing
popularity on campus:
What was the driving
motivation behind
the creation of Kinky
Klub?
Well I am a very open
person by nature, so
talking about sex comes
very naturally to me. But
lately I came to realise
that there isn’t a place
where people can go and
ask questions about what
goes on behind closed
doors in a safe environ-
ment. I have found that
once you start talking to
someone about what they
like and what they dislike
the conversation becomes
easy very quickly – it’s
just about getting over
that first hurdle of embar-
rassment or shyness. So I
decided to create a society
where that first hurdle
no longer exists – where
people can express them-
selves freely without the
fear of judgement.
How have you found
the process of creat-
ing the club? Was it
an easy journey, or
did you feel you had
to justify yourself
quite a lot?
The waiting period after
sending in the application
was quite long, and things
seemed to keep getting
pushed back. I honestly
never thought the Union
would allow it in the
first place but when the
second stage came around
the only thing they were
concerned about was how
much money the society
might make! They never
asked for any special
justification – in fact they
got excited by it!
What are the main ac-
tivities of Kinky Klub
going to be this year?
Well our first big
event will be a Sex Shop
Crawl around Soho. We
also want to get speakers
in to do talks, as well as
introducing people to the
alternative nightlife of
London. I have also had
many requests to do a
kinky tour to Amsterdam,
so hopefully that will go
ahead too.
What do you think
the main challeng-
es will be for Kinky
Klub?
The main challenge
I think will be to not get
a name for ourselves as
being the ‘orgy club’ –
obviously if people want
to have an orgy that’s up
to them but that’s not what
our society is exclusively
for. I can give you tips for
sure, but I ain’t organising
one!
You’ve already got
over 70 members –
are you surprised at
the Klub’s popularity?
I have to say I was
really surprised by the
support the society
received from the get go.
I thought I would at least
hit a little bit of resistance,
as nothing like this has
ever been done at Imperial
before, but instead people
have been so excited by
our societies creation.
It just goes to show that
everyone is a little kinky
on the inside!
Tom Bacarese-Ham-
ilton, Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies), told
Felix: We’re an inclusive
community at the Union,
we have all kinds of dif-
ferent student groups and
we’re happy to support
students to explore their
interests. We look forward
to reading their risk
assessment, and helping
them have an impact on
the student body.”

ENVIRONMENTAL
SOCIETY – IT’S EASY
BEE-ING GREEN
Being Green should be
something you strive to
do all year round, but if
you don’t know how then
Imperial’s Green Week is
a good place to start! The
Environmental Society
has an exciting calendar of
activities planned from the
12th
to the 18th
of February
aiming to inform and help
you to lead a more sustain-
able lifestyle. With bike
workshops, vegan food
tastings, clothes swaps,
and film screenings you’ll
be sure to find something
to do.
On Monday and
Thursday we’ll be running
bike repair workshops
so you can fix your bike
(for free!) and also learn
how to do it yourself. If
painting is your thing,
we’re also organising
an art workshop with
LeoSoc. Tuesday will see
a film screening of Black
Ice about Greenpeace
activists protesting the
first-ever oil drilling in the
Arctic Ocean. In addition
to having members of
Greenpeace joining us on
the evening, we are ex-
tremely lucky to have one
of the Arctic 30 with us
to answer your questions
following the film!
On Wednesday there
will be a Marine Conser-
vation Society informa-
tion stall during the day
followed by a film screen-
ing of Chasing Corals, in
the evening.
On Tuesday, Wednes-
day, and Thursday we’ll
be running various
workshops in our Secret
Garden. Our Secret
Garden is where we keep
our bees and plant our
vegetables, and we’re
always looking for people
who want to help main-
taining it. It’s also a won-
derful place to escape the
regular hustle and bustle
of London!
Finally, Friday we’ll
be holding a clothes
swap in Metric. If you’re
looking to unload some
of those jumpers you’ve
outgrown, or want to look
fresh but without the pain
of making your wallet
lighter then come and find
us there!
Aside from Green
Week, we have a number
of campaigns running
with the aim of making
Imperial a more sustain-
able and green campus.
Fashion Friendly is our
campaign to raise aware-
ness about the pollution
associated with clothes
production, and also
the human exploitation
involved. Our campaign
Chasing Corals is inspired
by the film of the same
name and encourages
people to reduce their
plastic consumption to
avoid it going into our
oceans.
Many people associate
being green with being
vegetarian or vegan, and
for good reason: animal
husbandry has significant
detrimental impacts to
the environment. Our
Less Meat Less Methane
campaign teaches people
about these by organising
a Less Meat Awareness
week and petitioning
the Union for Meat Free
Mondays. We also run a
Food Co-op where you
can buy locally sourced
food with little markup.
In short, there’s a lots of
ways of getting involved
with us and helping to
make Imperial a univer-
sity you can be proud of
having attended!
You can find the
Facebook page for the
Green Week at www.
facebook.com/Imperi-
algreenweek/. We’re
looking for volunteers,
so if you want to help us
out with any of the events
contact us at esoc@ic.ac.
uk.
