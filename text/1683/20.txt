Django Django venture into new territories
Always ones to be ambitious and experimental, Marble Skies sees the electro-rock outfit trying their hands at a
variety of new styles. The result is an eclectic jumble that oozes colour.
I
t would’ve been a
good name for a mar-
bled paper collage
I made about four
years ago – or at least a
better one than whatever
hedonistic tripe I pre-
sumably came up with.
Marble Skies, British
art-rock quartet Django
Django’s third album,
actually bears something
of a resemblance to my
teenage artistic endeav-
ours. Though a patchwork
of shapes, styles, and
moods, each piece fits
together with surprising
coherence, and the whole
thing is coated in a vi-
brant, psychedelic, spacey
glaze.
The opening and
titular track immediately
indicates a clear departure
from the feel of their
previous album. Born
Under Saturn was very
much dominated by big
sounds, pounding and
plodding through steady
beats and muscular riffs.
‘Marble Skies’ conveys a
new sense of urgency, an
assured charge that sees
them deftly sweeping
through layers of Kraft-
werk-esque retrofuturism,
punctuated by fast-paced
verses. “Take us as we
are”, the chorus boldly
declares - they’ve never
sounded more confident
in their style.
Something previously
alien to Django Django’s
discography comes with
second track ‘Surface to
Air’, in the form of guest
vocals from Slow Club’s
Rebecca Taylor, reincar-
nated as her new solo
project, Self Esteem. The
tempo drops a bit for this
one, and it feels somewhat
limp in comparison to
its predecessor. Usual
progress is soon resumed,
however, with ‘Cham-
pagne’, which is reminis-
“Is it a bit
superficial?
Potentially. Is
it enjoyable?
Inarguably”
“An assured
charge
that sees
them deftly
sweeping
through layers
of Kraftwerk-
esque
retrofuturism”
cent of their first album.
Staccato guitars, whirling
synths, and a faint back-
ground of elevator music
make this a pleasant but
largely forgettable track.
Next up is energetic
lead single ‘Tic Tac Toe’.
Behind its throbbing
bassline and chugging
drumbeat, the lyrics draw
on themes of nihilism and
the banal repetitiveness
of modern, consumerist
life (“Lately, have you
ever wondered why we’re
put here / playing each
and every game / day
by day?”). As always,
the sounds are texturally
rich and the production
immaculate, and though
it may initially sound like
something of a throw-
away, closer inspection
reveals evidence of their
meticulous studio crafts-
manship.
After a short burst of
space rock in the form
of ‘Further’, with its
jangly riffs and spiralling
mellotron, the album
really starts to take
shape. The understated
and wistful ‘Sundials’ is
perhaps their most tender
moment to date. With a
naked piano riff taking
centre stage, shy Beach
Boys harmonies glide
ethereally over distant
reverb and sublime sax-
ophone interludes. The
serenity is soon disturbed,
however, by the syncopat-
ed intro of ‘Beam Me Up’.
This dark and brooding
track is a real standout.
The sound is industrial and
bleak; the familiar falsetto
niceties are dropped in
favour of a chilling but
purposeful delivery,
laid over an undulating
bass and a progressive
synth accompaniment. It
wouldn’t be out of place
on a Horrors album, or
alongside some of Alt-J’s
more lively work. Dou-
ble-tracked vocals and
dense sonic layers give it
a very intense, full-bodied
flavour that makes for
an impressive auditory
experience.
Pulling a tight hairpin
once again, ‘In your
Beat’ is a straight up
pop banger. With an
uplifting sing-along
chorus about dancing,
you’d be forgiven for
mistaking it for a Calvin
Harris record. There are
hyperbolic builds, even a
drop. Perhaps this is their
attempt to break out into
the mainstream, or maybe
they just wanted to take
a rest from being opaque
and artsy to make a fun
feel-good song. Either
way, it’s perfect for radio
play, indie disco playlists
and sun-soaked festival
sets. Is it a bit superficial?
Potentially. Is it enjoya-
ble? Inarguably.
Laser guns and bouncy
beats fill the extended
intro of ‘Real Gone’ with
a very LCD Soundsystem
feel, before switching
to a Jagwar Ma style
electronic piece. Even-
tually, the high octane
drum machine gives way
to a gentle tinkle and fade
into ‘Fountains’. German
electronic and krautrock
pioneers Kraftwerk are
channelled once again,
this time via panpipes
that could’ve been lifted
straight from ‘Autobahn’.
Frontman Vincent Neff
shows his vocal prowess
here, with delicate,
sustained high notes
and buoyant transitions,
not dissimilar to that on
Jungle’s eponymous 2014
record. Despite the re-
curring nihilistic themes,
the LP closes on a note
of optimistic agnosticism
and acceptance.
Over ten short and
reasonably disconnected
tracks, Django Django
dabble in a variety of
genres, but wholly
commit to none. There’s a
distinct shift towards pop,
but not at the expense of
artistic integrity. It’s ex-
tremely playable and only
gets more infectious upon
repetition. While Marble
Skies likely won’t be held
in as high regard as their
mercury prize nominated
debut, it serves as an
important stepping stone
that secures their position
as ones to watch and keep
watching.

Hit the North – In tribute to Mark E. Smith
MUSIC
Jack O’Brien
Music Writer
T
o pretend that
the clamorous
and lengthy
discography of
The Fall, the fabled post
punk band spearheaded
by the imperious and now
deceased Mark E. Smith,
has shaped and defined
my musical tastes would
be a lie. I cannot claim
that the fractious frontman
served, as he has to so
many others, as a particu-
larly important influence
on my musical inclination
up until his death, or at
least not consciously.
Instead, the influence
of his now silent raspy
Mancunian voice, best
heard conjuring up bizarre
and uncouth imagery over
repetitive guitar riffs, had
been a wayward one in my
life. Smith existed to me
as the man behind such
belters as ‘Hit the North’,
‘Totally Wired’ and ‘Hard
life in the Country’. He
was the notoriously acer-
bic delinquent with the
famously quick temper
and tendency towards
physical violence. He was
the endlessly endorsed
and recommended art-
ist’s artist, upheld and
written about at length
by journalists far trendier
and more talented than
I. He existed as a spectre;
a wraith whose work I
never fully indulged, a
cultural behemoth I never
fully absorbed.
It is for this reason
that it seemed weird that
after the announcement
of his passing on 24th
January, I felt a sense of
loss usually reserved for
artists who have held a
more significant sway on
my tastes. Even after the
death of Prince or Bowie,
artists who by the brute
force of radio-friendly
osmosis I had imbibed
almost endlessly, I didn’t
feel as bothered as when I
heard the news of Smith’s
elicited such a peculiarly
strong response. Am I so
sentimental as to mourn
the loss of those I barely
knew, especially in the
case of an obscurity like
Smith?
An answer, at least in
part, emerged a few days
later when the comedian
Stewart Lee, an apparent
Fall mega fan, appeared
on Radio 6. Lee com-
mented that whereas
everyone had some
connection to the deaths
of Bowie and Prince,
Mark E. Smith remained
unique as having a deep
and fruitful connection
with a minority. He was
the pioneer of a band
sealed into legend not by
the mass act of popular
idolisation, but instead
by the intense adoration
of a few. The Fall was the
most famously unknown
band of all time - an
ever shifting ensemble
of musicians bundled
together by its leader.
They were only loved by
those for whom the penny
had dropped, those who
had, at the least, made the
effort to discover them in
depth.
The upset I felt at his
death has been realised
as the knowledge that
I would have loved his
music while he lived,
that, for me, the penny
did not drop while he
was alive. He was not the
wraith I thought he was,
a grumbling ghost on
the fringes of my tastes,
but a staunchly northern
poet who domineered a
scene with such relent-
less temerity that I feel
ashamed to remark that
it is only now that I have
begun to explore his work.
I have cruelly learned
what I was missing. In
the past few days, I have
revelled and nourished my
soul on the cold northern
abstraction of his cryptic
lyrics. I have hijacked
speakers so that I may
belt out his Godly tunes
for my own indulgence in
the presence of gentiles,
and even dozed off into
violent dreams at the
behest of his eclectically
angry music. I am sure
the commentariat who
held Mark E. Smith as a
pinnacle of creativity are
envious of the freshness
with which I now tuck
into iconic old albums and
performances. I am sure
that they too share the
selfish glee I now take in
getting to know the well
curated museum of Mark
E. Smith, with its varied
and seemingly endless list
of quirks.
I lament never seeing
him live, as I was urged
to do by my annoyingly
prescient brother. Instead,
I can only take solace in
the poetry of an artist
I have come to late, an
artist I missed before I
even knew it, who said
things I wish I could have.
“Yell down nights in
hysterical breath / Those
Northern Lights, so pretty
/ Those big big big wide
streets / Those useless
MPs / Savages”
RIP Mark E. Smith.
