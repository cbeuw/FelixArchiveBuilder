Women’s 1st Team Fencing: Always on point
O
n the 27th
/28th
January, the
I m p e r i a l
Women’s 1st
Team Fencing, travelled to
Hampstead Heath to fence
for over 15 hours in the
Southern Premier League
weekend. We competed
against the 1st
teams from
Oxford , Cambridge ,
UCL , Surrey and Bristol.
We unfortunately
started with our only
loss of the weekend – to
Oxford. Despite a close
match in epee and a win
in sabre, their strong foil
team managed to swing
the match to an overall
win.
That loss motivated
us to work even harder
in the next match against
Cambridge. Guilia
Mandelli managed to
secure the final point in a
hard fought foil match to
secure a win of 45-44, and
despite a close loss in the
epee, Niamh Spence led
the sabre team to a large
lead win, resulting in a
comfortable victory over
Cambridge
The last match on
Saturday extending into
our 9th
continuous hour
of fencing was against
Bristol. Undeterred by
narrowly losing the first
match we went on to
smash the rest of the
matches, gaining a wide
lead and finishing with a
strong win.
Sunday brought about
the closest match of the
weekend against Surrey,
where after some sneaky
tactics from Surrey, we
were at a draw entering
the final round of epee.
The match was extremely
nerve-racking, however
the experience and de-
termination of Francesca
Cavallo brought an emo-
tional win home for the
Imperial Women’s 1s.
Our final match of the
weekend was against UCL
and we entered the match
exhausted yet determined.
Although starting out as a
close match, we finished
with a comfortable win of
130-123.
Overall we won four
out of five matches
placing us 2nd
in the
Southern Premier League
and putting us in a com-
manding position for
the upcoming knockout
Championship rounds.
Despite being one of the
youngest teams on the
circuit, we truly pushed
ourselves to the absolute
limit and produced a fan-
tastic result. Over my four
years on Women’s 1s,
this is the best that a team
has achieved. The whole
team showed incredible
determination, endurance
and performance. Finally,
thank you to Sherry Xu
for being an incredible
Womens 1s captain with
unparalleled motivational
team talks, tactics, and
support.

L
ike the Women’s
team, the Men’s
1st
Team Fencing
also spent the
weekend fencing in
Hampstead Heath. Our
league consisted of
Oxford 1s, Cambridge
1s, UCL 1s, Bristol 1s,
and us. Our first match of
the weekend was against
UCL, a match we needed
to win if we were to avoid
being in the relegation
spot. Firstly, our incred-
ibly strong foil team
anchored by Guillermo
Delberque carried us to an
easy lead of 45-24. This
was followed by UCL
winning epee by a single
point but an exceptional
performance by Matei
Grama lead the team to a
win overall. Imperial 128
– UCL 114.
Our next match was
against Cambridge. Just
as we were about to start,
an old injury of James
Odger’s, our strongest
epeeist, put him out of the
match. We persevered,
achieving a close win in
epee, and a close loss in
foil. In the final round of
sabre, we were cursed
with injury again when
Chris Erickson suffered a
hand injury that rendered
him unable to fence, and
with no substitute avail-
able, we conceded the
bout. Two injuries making
what could’ve been a
decisive win into a very
close defeat. Imperial 120
- Cambridge 125.
Our final match of the
Saturday was against
Bristol. We began with
foil again, with the skill of
our foil team giving us a 7
point lead going into epee.
With Guillermo filling in
for James, we struggled
against an experienced
team, losing epee. Despite
an incredible performance
from Guillermo filling in
for Chris this time, sabre
was no better. Imperial
103 - Bristol 128.
We all arrived Sunday
morning refreshed and
hopeful. We had only one
match against Oxford,
and we were confident we
could win, despite being
3 fencers short of our full
team. We began with foil,
and a strong showing from
all fencers: we foil with a
5 point lead. Sabre was
next, where we pulled it
back and closed the gap to
10 points. The final match
of foil was close the entire
way through, interrupted
only briefly by one of
Oxford fencers ripping
his mask off to throw up.
We entered the final bout
leading 40-37 and needed
to get to 45 before they
get to 41. It now all lies on
Filip Anies who takes it
to an excruciatingly close
44-40 but just missed the
crucial last point. The
final score: Imperial 125 -
Oxford 127.
We finished 5th
in the
league, ahead of UCL,
and considering the
injuries we faced and the
fencers we were missing,
we are incredibly proud
of our performance. Time
to prepare ourselves for
the Cup!

ICSM Water Polo hit the streets (and pools) of Lisbon

O
n Friday 19th
January 42
m e m b e r s
of ICSM
Water Polo met at West
Brompton Station giddy
with excitement for our
2018 international tour to
Lisbon. The journey to
Lisbon was long, and not
without hiccups, but even-
tually we found ourselves
in our natural habitat
– poolside, ready to face
what Lisbon’s university
had to offer. Despite this
being a friendly match,
intended to be just a warm
up for the competitive
one we had planned for
the Saturday, we were
faced by Lisbon’s finest
water polo players. Our
social team stood pool-
side; intrepid with fear
as Lisbon’s ‘friendly’
team rolled out their
gym mats and pulled out
their resistance bands for
a warm-up our 2nd
team
would consider a full-on
workout. Nonetheless our
social members pulled
through and played their
best. As this was a friend-
ly match – intended as
just a preliminary training
session for Saturday – the
score for this match was
not recorded. As the social
members played our first
team trained on the other
end of the pool.
After training we
ventured back to our
hostel, where we greeted
by some lovely staff
who gave us pizza and
sangria which was much
needed! We then ventured
as a team to the bars as a
team social in exploring
some of Lisbon’s famous
nightlife.
The team awoke on the
Saturday excited to play,
the hostel provided a large
complimentary breakfast
and our first team took the
opportunity to carb load.
We then had a few hours
before we needed to travel
back to the pool. Many
members of the team took
the opportunity to go for a
short walk and explore the
local area, while others
napped and prepared for
the game.
The game commenced
shortly after 1pm and
we played in running
quarters. Despite a strong
lead of 2-0 in the first five
minutes of the game we
soon realised our team
was exhausting quickly
and that subbing in and
out was crucial to ensure
our team didn’t tire too
much. Despite the change
in tactics by the end of the
first quarter the score was
a draw at 2-2.
A quick team chat in
between quarters about
subbing tactics and
ensuring we swum back
quickly when the ball
changed hands helped to
change the game around
for a minute or two as we
scored and were playing
well; however the Lisbon
team were strong and
were putting up a good
fight so by the halfway
mark the game had turned
around with a score of 7-3
to Lisbon.
The social team from
the sidelines begun to
cheer, and their support
kept the morale high. One
of our alumni, Laurence
Suckling, then made a
surprise appearance in the
viewing area and we knew
we then had to give our
best and not lose hope.
The first few minutes
of the third quarter
were uneventful with
neither team scoring or
conceding. Then in our
possession Laurence
begun to chant “Leo..
Leo” and Leo, spurred on
by the support, swum up
and was passed the ball,
making an amazing goal
to win title of man of the
match. The excitement
was short lived as we
finished the quarter with
a score of 10-4 to Lisbon.
The final quarter we
were determined to put
up a strong fight and we
played strong until the
end. Even though the final
score was 15-9 to Lisbon
we ended the game in
high spirits as we knew
we had played really well
against a very strong and
prepared team.
Following a photo the
social team were keen to
jump in and play from
where we left off the
previous day; the first
teams were exhausted
and keen to shower for
our evening social with
Lisbon.
Later that evening we
met the Lisbon team at
a restaurant where we
enjoyed a three course
meal and wine with the
team. We discussed water-
polo – and of course less
serious matters – before
heading back to the bars
with Lisbon’s team as our
guide. We returned in the
early hours and enjoyed a
long and much needed lie
in on the Sunday.
On Sunday we had
originally planned some
land-based training.
However as many of our
team were feeling worse
for wear we decided to do
a long walk as a team and
stretch out our muscles
from the previous days.
We walked from the
hostel to Lisbon’s famous
Oceanarium.
In the evening we
had planned a team
bonding activity – Bubble
Football!
This was really fun and
a great opportunity for our
social team and our firsts
team to bond and play in
mixed groups. It involved
us playing football while
in a Zorbing ball. It was
incredibly tiring and defi-
nitely compensated for
our failed gym set in the
morning.
On Monday morning,
we packed up and got
prepared to leave. We
travelled to the Lisbon
Time Out market and
enjoyed a large meal
together where we could
discuss the events of tour
– the biggest tour we have
ever been on, and our
most successful to date!
