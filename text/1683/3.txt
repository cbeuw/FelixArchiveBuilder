Leadership Elections
opened this week, with
eligible students able to
stand for over 400 roles,
including Council Chair,
Liberation and Commu-
nity Officers, and CSP
Committee positions.
This year’s elections see
a number of changes,
including reduced cam-
paigning periods.
Seven paid sabbatical
roles will also be elected:
Union President, the
four Officer Trustees
– Deputy President (Edu-
cation), Deputy President
(Welfare), Deputy Presi-
dent (Clubs & Societies),
and Deputy President
(Finance & Services) –
ICSMSU President, and
Felix Editor.
More students' unions call for NSS boycott
Survey (NSS) over con-
cerns it could be linked
to future rises in tuition.
Manchester University
Students’ Union (MUSU)
and Cambridge University
Students’ Union (CUSU)
have both announced they
will be boycotting the
NSS. Durham Students’
Union (DSU), while
not boycotting the NSS,
have refused to actively
promote the survey.
Last week CUSU
joined Oxford University
Students’ Union in boy-
cotting the NSS, following
a vote in CUSU Council.
The CUSU stated: “many
of the objections to par-
ticipation in the NSS that
stood last year still stand”,
and said there was”no
guarantee the temporary
freeze on tuition fees
would continue.”
MUSU has also asked
students not to fill in the
NSS, citing concerns the
data could still be used
to raise fees in the future.
“Fees are frozen for now,”
MUSU said in a statement,
“but the TEF uses a 3-year
average of students’ NSS
data. So if you fill it in
this year, it will be used in
2020 when fees could be
unfrozen.”
In an email sent out
to Imperial students
earlier this year, Profes-
sor Simone Buitendijk,
Imperial’s Vice-Provost
(Education), and Nick
Burstow, Imperial College
Union’s Deputy President
(Education), asked final
years to complete the
survey. They said the
results would “help the
College see both where
it is excelling, but also
where it can improve”,
and they “hoped to beat”
the 2017 participation rate
of 74%.
Last year Cambridge
and Manchester were
among the twelve univer-
sities that successfully led
a boycott of the NSS, with
a turnout of under 50%
leading to invalidation of
the data.
The boycott was driven
by the link the NSS would
have with the controver-
sial Teaching Excellence
Framework (TEF), which
was previously supposed
to be linked to rises
in tuition fees. While
Theresa May announced
in October that tuition
fees would be frozen
for the upcoming year, a
number of student groups
continue to have concerns
over the link between
TEF and marketisation of
higher education.
The NSS is sent out
each year to final year
undergraduates at higher
education institutions in
the UK. It is undertaken
by Ipsos MORI.
The nomination period
opened last Wednesday,
and will run until midday,
Monday 26th
February.
There will then be a week
of candidate training,
before candidates are re-
vealed and voting begins
on Friday 2nd
March.
Voting will run for a week,
until Friday 9th
March.
A spokesperson from
Imperial College Union
told Felix: “In the Lead-
ership Elections 2018,
Britain’s biggest student
elections, there are roles
to suit every interest – our
members can nominate
themselves now, and
take part in the country’s
strongest student democ-
racy.”
This year a number of
changes may affect the
election process. Last
October, it was announced
the President of the
Graduate Students’ Union
(GSU) – one of Imperial’s
six Constituent Unions,
representing taught and
research postgraduates
– would become a paid,
part-time role. The role
will take up two working
days a week, and the GSU
President will receive a
stipend of £10,000. Luke
McCrone, the current
GSU President, told Felix
at the time: “I am certain
the position will be more
hotly contested in future,
hopefully helping to
attract better quality can-
didates.”
This year will also see
the traditional two week
campaigning period – one
week of campaigning
before voting opened, and
then a further week of
campaigning while voting
took place – replaced with
a single week of voting
and campaigning.
A spokesperson for the
begins, and voting opens
at the same time.’ They
also cited the new week of
training as providing more
support for candidates.
Reaction to the new
voting period has been
mixed. Claudia Caravello,
President of the City and
Guilds College Union
(CGCU), told Felix: “I
think students having
to spend only one week
campaigning will be
better for their studies
and wellbeing, but it will
require candidates to
plan their campaigns a
lot more. The campaign
period will intensify, and
the week will go by pretty
quickly.”
Others cited concerns
over the advantage it
might give some students.
Abhijay Sood, Academic
Affairs Officer for the
Royal College of Science
Union (RCSU) told
Felix: “By eliminating
the pre-voting campaign
period, the Union are
denying those who are
less well known on
campus the change to get
their names out there, and
giving others an unfair
advantage. The right to
all students to participate
in a fair election should
trump that of those who
find the two week period
inconvenient.”
Imperial College Union
will be hoping to achieve
a high voter turnout, after
a reduction in voters
from 2016 to 2017. In the
2016 Elections, Imperial
achieved the highest
turnout in the country:
45.47% of eligible voters
turned out, with over 60%
of undergraduates voting;
in last year’s elections,
however, the turnout
dropped more than eight
points, to 36.78%, with a
significant fall in turnout
of taught postgraduates.
Nominations are open
until 26th February.
Voting opens on 2nd
March. You can nominate
yourself here: vote.union.

The petition, which
is on more than 700
signatures at the
time of writing, calls
the decision "deeply
disappointing".
Fred Fyles

A
petition has
been launched
following Im-
perial College
London’s announcement
to close the swimming
pool at the St. Mary’s
campus.
The swimming pool is
scheduled to close from
the 16th
July, 2018, at the
end of this academic year.
College faculty have cited
concerns over cost effec-
tiveness, saying College
students and staff only
make up 15% of users of
the pool, which is run by
Sport Imperial.
The petition, which has
more than 700 signatures
at time of writing, says
the closure was made
“with no prior warning
or consultation”, calling
I
mperial College
Union Netball 1st
team and Imperial
College School
of Medicine (ICSM)
Netball 1st team are set
to battle it out in Varsi-
tyFest’s Headline match
Netball to headline 2018 Varsity
this year, after winning a
public vote.
The vote, which ran
until Friday 26th
January,
asked students to pick
between Netball (1st
Team), Men’s Rugby (1st
Team), and Kabaddi for
the Headline and Show-
case matches. Netball
gained 40% of the vote,
with 216 students choos-
ing the 1st team for the
Headline match. Kabaddi
achieved 32% of the vote,
and Men’s Rugby (1st
Team) gained 29%. This
means that IC Kabaddi
will be playing the Show-
case match; they played
their first match as part of
VarsityFest only last year.
The choice of Netball
for the Headline match
comes after they previous-
ly played the Showcase
match at VarsityFest 2017.
In their application, they
said the team were well
suited to headline Varsity-
Fest due to the “fast-paced
and high-scoring nature of
the game”, and promised
to “offer a competitive
match that is unlikely to
be one-sided”.
Ellen Fletcher, Club
Captain of Imperial
College Netball, told
Felix: “The 1s have had
an incredible start to
2018, and haven’t lost a
match yet – despite some
initial nerves, the team
are now working hard to
keep their winning streak
going through to Varsity!
It’s an exciting change
that a women’s sport will
be headlining, and I think
it shows how much people
enjoyed the Showcase last
year, and how far both
clubs have come.”
A Union representative
told Felix: “The student
poll on Varsity’s Headline
and Showcase has really
opened up the event to
include a spotlight on
newer and developing
sports, while highlighting
Imperial’s inclusive sport-
ing community. Netball’s
successful Showcase
in 2017 continues to be
supported by students,
pushing them on to
achieve 2018’s Headline.“
This year is the first
time the Headline match
has been a women’s
team since 2015, when
Women’s Rugby were the
centrepiece. Their game
was overshadowed by a
number of issues, includ-
ing transport mix-ups
meaning coaches left
early, and allegations of
verbal abuse from staff
members. The captain of
the club said at the time
that the events “highlight-
ed the sexisn that is un-
fortunately very present
at Imperial.”
VarsityFest is in its
16th
year, and will see
ICSM teams competing
against Imperial College
teams across 11 sports.
The matches will take
place across three dates:
water polo on Friday 23rd
February; Hockey Var-
sityFest on Wednesday
28th
March; and the main
VarsityFest on Saturday
3rd
March.
the decision “deeply dis-
appointing, short-sighted,
and unjust”. It also argues
that it goes against Sport
Imperial’s “current strat-
egy of promoting mental
and physical wellbeing”.
The St. Mary’s Hospi-
tal Association (SMHA),
the alumnus organisation
for the St. Mary’s medical
school graduates, also
cited concerns over com-
munication. They said
they “deplore the lack of
consultation that appears
to have occurred prior to
the closure of the pool
being announced.”
In a statement to Felix,
representatives of the
SMHA said: “In financial-
ly constrained times, we
fully recognise the need
for tough decisions to be
made regarding facilities
for students and staff. It
may be the case that the
pool has been underused
in recent years, but this
may be because of poor
marketing and under-
investment. Talking to
colleagues in the hospital,
very few are even aware
of the existence of a pool
in the medical school.”
“We strongly back
the need for open,
thoughtful consultation
and publication of the
facts relating to usage
of the pool and efforts at
income-generation that
have been tried before a
final decision is made.”
ACollegespokesperson
said “the costs of required
maintenance mean it is
not sustainable to contin-
ue running this facility”,
and that the pool’s closure
“is part of the College’s
wider cost savings which
are designed to allow for
reinvestment of funds into
the academic mission.”
The petition refers to
the long history of St.
Mary’s pool, which has
been open for 80 years.
Kevin Brown, Trust
Archivist for Imperial
College Healthcare NHS
Trust and Curator of
the Alexander Fleming
Museum Laboratory, told
Felix of the pool’s histori-
cal pedigree:
“Alexander Fleming
was one of the first users
of the swimming pool
when it opened in the
early 1930s. Water sports
had in a way brought
him to St. Mary’s. He
had played water polo
for the London Scottish
Regiment against a team
from St. Mary’s and had
been so impressed by
their esprit de corps and
friendliness that when he
came to apply to medical
school in 1901 he chose
St. Mary’s rather than
any of the other medical
schools in London at that
time.”
The petition also high-
lights the role the pool
plays currently, saying
it benefits “a wide cross
section of students, staff,
sports groups, and the
wider local community”,
and ”boasts developing
the talent of interna-
tional sporting stars,
including Emma Watson,
cross-Channel swimmer.”
The decision was an-
nounced at the beginning
of last month on Imperial
College’s website. The
20-meter pool, which will
remain open throughout
the rest of the year, is open
to students, Imperial staff,
NHS staff, and members
of the public.
A College spokesper-
son told Felix: “Imperial
is committed to providing
sports facilities of the
highest standard for its
staff and student com-
munity, and we know the
facility has been a valued
part of the St. Mary’s
Campus for many years.
The pool will continue to
be open as normal for the
first half of 2018, and the
swimming pool at Ethos
on the South Kensington
Campus is available for
all College students and
staff.”
