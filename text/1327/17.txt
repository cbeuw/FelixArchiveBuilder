When it was announced that
Southside halls were being replaced,
the first thought running through
our minds for many of us was prob-
ably: “Oh no! What’s going to hap-
pen to our Southside Bar?”
But believe it or not, the Southside
Bar is not the only long-serving tra-
dition that will be lost in the midst of
the Southside demolition debris. The
Imperial College Islamic Society has
been holding weekly Friday Prayers
in Southside for more than 20 years.
And some even quote the figure
nearer to 30!
The ‘Juma Prayer’, formally
known as the Congregation Prayer,
acts as a focal point for at least
300 students during term time from
a range of societies, not just the
Islamic society.
You will see many attendees from
societies like Arab, Bangladesh,
Malaysian and Pakistan to name
a few. You may even spot a few
faces from the local community,
from Embassy workers to Science
Museum staff. But whoever you
might bump into on their way to
Juma on a Friday at midday, he
or she will be sure to tell you that
Juma is a time for them to revitalise
their connection with God; a time to
reflect and evaluate oneself during
the past week. It is also a time to
come together as an community to
share ideas and support one anoth-
er in people’s everyday affairs.
“So what?” I hear you cry, but
this religious and sociable gather-
ing means much more than that!
In fact Juma is one of those weekly
highlights in many Muslim students’
lives. The post-Juma ritual of catch-
ing up with the week’s events and
grabbing some “munch” has become
an addictive tradition for many
each Friday afternoon. The Juma
Prayer at Imperial has also hosted
many charities to raise thousands
of pounds for the less fortunate
across the world. In November 2004,
Islamic Society collected £9000 for
the Bangladesh floods that occurred
several months prior. Unfortunately
all of this will come to a close on
Friday 24 June, when Southside is
knocked down.
The Islamic Society has been given
the use of the Union gym over sum-
mer as a temporary solution. Over
the summer, the Juma prayers will
be held in this gym between 1 and
2pm each Friday, until a long-term
replacement has been found. The
Juma attendees will find it a little
difficult in the gym itself, as it is too
small to fit the entire congregation;
the Prayer has to be split into two
rooms, and on some weeks it will
occur on two floors!
We, the Islamic Society, would like
to notify all students of the Juma
location change from Southside to
the Union Building (opposite Beit
Quad) during the summer. We also
ask students to watch for updates
with regards to the Autumn term
Juma venue, which is yet to be
resolved. The Islamic Society wel-
comes all to attend the sermon
before the prayer that is given in
English.

Juma Prayer and the Islamic
Society’s activities, please visit

ISLAMIC SOCIETY
The Friday feeling By Noah Nkonge
Engineers Without Borders (EWB)
is a student-run charity that sees
engineering as a tool that can be
used to help people escape from the
cycle of poverty. To that end, EWB
Imperial held a training weekend
to demonstrate appropriate technol-
ogy for less developed regions, and
to promote and increase awareness
of social, political and health issues
around development work.
The weekend comprised of practi-
cal group activities such as the con-
struction of solar cookers (thanks
to Quentin Stowell of Nordson UV
Ltd) and a mock waste incinerator,
as well as a series of illuminating
talks from those who have first-hand
experience of work in the develop-
ment field.
There were talks from EWB mem-
bers Mo Ali and Susan Long, who had
been to Ecuador to help build mud
stoves in a small village; and a talk
on the current state of photovoltaic
energy, and a talk from Tom Jackson
(Voluntary Services Overseas) on
his experiences of working within
the Tanzanian culture whilst build-
ing waste incinerators.
The training weekend was also
an invaluable opportunity to meet
people with practical experience of
development engineering and oth-
ers who shared a mutual interest in
the development field. Apart from
the dodgy heating system in Civ
Eng, the training weekend was a
success, and EWB Imperial hopes
to run a similar event next year.
