Shooting stars to predict climate change
At the edge of space, the Eath’s atmosphere may actually be cooling. Emma-Lynn Donadieu
reports on scientists using an unusual technique to monitor the mesosphere
“It’s a bit like going to Ikea
and buying a flat-pack. It
comes in several boxes, you
put it together, plug it in, turn
the power on and hope that
it doesn’t blow up,” explains
Dr Peter Younger, a postdoc
from the University of Bath.
He recently returned from a
two-month expedition brav-
ing severe gales, some rath-
er aggressive fur seals and
‘horrific’ wind chill, to set up
a radar the size of a foot-
ball field on a rocky beach in
Antarctica.
The new radar, a joint
project between the
University of Bath and the
British Antarctic Survey, will
allow scientists to measure
climate change in the meso-
sphere, the highest layer of
the Earth’s atmosphere at the
very edge of space.
Luckily for Dr Younger, this
radar is entirely autonomous
and can be controlled via the
internet from the warmth of
an office.
The team at the University
of Bath will use the radar
to explore the theory that
while the lower atmosphere
is warming; the mesosphere
may be cooling by as much as
one degree Centigrade a year.
Under the higher pressures of
the lower atmosphere, carbon
dioxide has a reputation as a
greenhouse gas and acts as
an efficient heating agent. In
the mesosphere, however, the
pressures are so low that the
chemistry changes and car-
bon dioxide acts as a refriger-
ant. Unfortunately, at heights
of 80-100km the mesosphere is
notoriously difficult to investi-
gate, so the rate at which it is
cooling is unknown.
“The mesosphere is too
high to reach by Met balloons
or aeroplanes so you can’t fly
a thermometer up there. You
can fly a rocket through it
with a thermometer attached,
but a rocket gives you a snap-
shot and it costs £100,000 a
time,” explains Professor
Nick Mitchell, who heads the
project in the Department
of Electronic and Electrical
Engineering at the University
of Bath. “But fortunately,
nature provides us with an
excellent answer to the prob-
lem of investigating the meso-
sphere.”
Meteors the size of a grain
of sand burn up in the meso-
sphere creating the romantic
phenomena of shooting stars.
Hitting the upper atmosphere
at a typical velocity of 12 to 17
kilometres per second, they
create a column of ionised gas
a couple of metres across and
tens of kilometres in length.
Using the radar, the team
can bounce radio waves off the
ionized gas columns to pro-
duce distinctive echoes, which
act rather like thermometers.
The way the echoes decay
as the ionisation diffuses is
dependent on the tempera-
ture of the mesosphere. By
analysingthisdecay,scientists
can obtain accurate tempera-
ture measurements to within
five degrees centigrade. Data
the group at the University of
Bath have analysed to date
reveals an extremely chilly
mesosphere with tempera-
tures delving as low as –130
degrees Centigrade.
By continually monitoring
temperature fluctuations in
the mesosphere, Professor
Mitchell and his team hope
to separate known changes
in the upper atmosphere
associated with the Sun’s 11-
year solar cycle from climate
change caused by carbon
dioxide produced on Earth.
“The mesosphere has been
called the miner’s canary for
climate change; meaning that
it is very sensitive and the
changes there may be larg-
er than in any other part of
the atmosphere,” comments
Professor Mitchell. “The
great advantage of the radar
is that we can pick up 5000
meteors a day and we can do
this day after day after day, so
we can continually monitor
the temperature for as long as
the radar is running.”
The radar in Antarctica is
the latest addition in a glo-
bal array being installed by
the University of Bath group.
Their most recent edition
was purposely built as a clone
of another radar inside the
Arctic Circle in northern
Sweden and will enable them
to compare the upper atmos-
phere of the Arctic with that
of the Antarctic.
New physical phenom-
ena may already be appear-
ing because of the cooling
trend in the mesosphere.
These include unusual clouds
known as noctilucent clouds
and sprites formed by gigan-
tic lightening discharges
from clouds up into the meso-
sphere.
For us here on Earth the
effects of are likely to be less
dramatic. How a cooling mes-
osphere interacts with the
warming lower atmosphere
has yet to be determined.
“There is some theoretical
work that suggests that there
are coupling processes that
can connect what happens
upstairs with what happens
downstairs. The effects, if
they are there, are subtle and
mysterious and are simply
not well understood,” explains
Professor Mitchell.
Like the myriad of other
monitoring techniques, a
flat-pack radar on a remote
Antarctic beach won’t provide
the definitive answer on cli-
mate change. Nevertheless,
shooting stars are not just a
pretty sight but may reveal
new insights into a poorly
understood part of the atmos-
phere, enabling scientists to
fit another piece into the com-
plex climate puzzle.
Shooting star events take place in the mesosphere
“The team will explore
the theory that the
mesosphere may be
cooling by as much as
one degree centigrade
per year”
