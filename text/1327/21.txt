LIVE REVIEWS
System Of A Down were one of the
stronger acts that emerged during
the turn of the century nu-metal
craze, although they don’t really
deserve having that moniker round
their necks. Their latest album,
Mezmerize, shows if anything that
they haven’t lost any of that origi-
nality or energy in their record-
ings, though of course the biggest
question I had when I turned up
in Brixton was whether this still
translated into the ability to pull off
a great live show.
Look away now, because the short
answer is yes! An honourable men-
tion must go beforehand to their gig-
mates Eighties Matchbox B-Line
Disaster. Having only listened to
them occasionally on the radio, I
wasn’t sure if they would be playing
any better than the current wave of
retro indie plaguing the airwaves. In
fact they rocked. L-O-U-D. Nothing
compared to electro-grindcore, but
not really for the faint of heart either.
It would’ve been nice if there was
slightly less feedback in their half-
hour slot, as they actually weren’t a
bad opener for a group like System,
which is never an easy thing.
When the world’s best (and prob-
ably only) Armenian-folk-metal-
fusion act walked on an hour later,
more or less on time, they began
with the first three songs off their
latest effort, including the new sin-
gle B.Y.O.B. This stands for Bring
Your Own Bombs, apparently, which
proves that they haven’t lost that
topical edge. Of course, attacking
the Bush administration has been
a popular pastime for the past five
years, but for a band whose previous
songs have dealt with such issues
as drug rehabilitation programs and
recognition of the Armenian geno-
cide, they have a political agenda
that is actually far more mature
than that of the band-wagon jump-
ing celebrities who have been all too
visible in the news of recent weeks.
Cutting to the chase, these three
songs actually did little to stir up
emotions of the audience. It didn’t
help that bassist Shavo was the
only band member who was mov-
ing around at this point, somewhat
damping the onstage lunacy they’re
renowned for. I wasn’t thinking the
band would go on to play for a fur-
ther ninety minutes, but then this
was System Of A Down live, where
the unexpected really is expected.
And every one of those minutes
was worth it! The point at which it
became obvious that Needles was
being played, the show shifted up a
few gears and everyone was treated
to a truly awesome experience.
Of the 25 or so songs played,
the biggest share was taken from
Toxicity, with the boys getting a few
from their self-titled as well, which
was nice to see. Adding a couple of
obscure covers and maybe a song or
two off the next album Hypnotize,
due in the Autumn, their talents
weren’t wasted purely on the new
album, even though in hindsight it
would’ve been nice to see a couple
more of the new songs. Either way,
it was an entertaining night for all
concerned, and proof that System
are a band marching on and con-
tinuing to draw hordes of support for
their own flavour of WTF-inducing
rock music. Alex McKitrick
With a series of cancellations, inter-
mittent releases and band instabil-
ity episodes to their good name,
the actual appearance of Queen
Adreena after three very average
support bands kept the punters rapt
from the word go. Famous for their
legendary live shows, performed by
an alternately drunk or high Katie
Jane Garside, Queen Adreena’s act
juxtaposed ethereal art rock with a
car crash, with Katie Jane’s impres-
sion of a more approachable Kate
Bush on crack providing endless
mind-bending entertainment for the
crowds that amassed.
Sympathy for the poster-girl for
anorexia and her ridiculous ging-
ham loincloth aside, the band
worked their way through a very
short, albeit tight set, comprising
of highlights from Taxidermy and
Drink Me. Very few songs from the
recently released Butcher And The
Butterfly release were previewed,
those that were played melding
seamlessly into the fore. The audi-
ence were taken into a world of
demons and daisies, whilst being
spat at by every howl, rasp and yelp
emitted by one of the most spell-
binding performers ever to walk the
London stage. Being taken into the
void by a stage-diving work of art is
one thing; being taken that bit deep-
er by someone wearing everyone’s
heart on their sleeve is absolutely
compelling. Kitty Collar, Pretty
Polly and Pretty Like Drugs are all
great songs, but losing yourself in
the midst of such an expressive per-
formance is another experience.
Queen Adreena are competent and
passionate, but not quite as furious
as I had come to expect from their
records. Highly recommended.

Selling out the Astoria within a mat-
ter of hours is the way forward when
it comes to ensuring that your gig
goes down a treat. (See NIN and
the wonderful Avenged Sevenfold for
further reference.)
It means your fans are fanatical.
Whether they’re less discerning is a
different matter, this variable being
heavily hormone-dependent in the
case of bands with evident aesthetic
appeal.
Case in point? Rooster. Supported
ably by the Weezer-lite Famous Last
Words, the band took to the stage
with visibly little fervour for a home-
coming gig. The three instrumental-
ists stood comparatively still, with
only Luke on lead guitar providing
adequate foil to the nimbly-hipped
Nick Atkinson. The songs melded
seamingly into the midst of scream-
ing and swooning, the bulk of them
being taken from the band’s epony-
mous debut album. Two new songs,
Home and Standing In Line, stand
out from the almost predictable set
from a band so capable of doing
so much better. Luke’s improvisa-
tion on Free’s Alright Now and the
instrument swapping on Angels
were substantial evidence that the
only way is up.
With solid pop-rock stompers being
belted out in quick succession, a lit-
tle more variation and a couple more
covers wouldn’t have gone amiss.
The band appear to have reached a
comfort zone where the onus is left
to Atkinson to make the show.
Boy, he tries. Swaggering, pos-
turing, posing – this guy can sing,
dance, look hot and move! But the
ennui sets in so it’s a tired man lead-
ing the two-single encore, lightening
up during the rousing renditions of
You’re So Right For Me and Come
Get Some. Pleasing as these tunes
are, the observer comes away feel-
ing the set-up is a little contrived,
where Nick taking to the stage to
recite the intricacies of his bowel
habit would have garnered the same
effect.
Ultimately, unsatisfying.

Queen Adreena make a rare live appearance, System Of A Down bring their insane live
show (and beards) to London, and Rooster fail to impress

This is the end; the end, my friend, the end
So, the academic year is over. You’re
all finishing your projects, present-
ing presentations or killing your neu-
rons with excessive alcohol intake.
I think most of you will agree that
this year has been a great one for
Felix. We’ve seen a huge expan-
sion in the content of the sections,
and the move to newspaper format
has made the paper look way more
professional and given you more
words to skip over while you look for
the crossword. I think most of the
credit for this should go to Mr David
Edwards, who has worked many late
hours and sweated buckets of, well,
sweat over printing, layouts, editing
my badly written prose, and actually
making Felix make money.
On a personal note I’d like to thank
Dave for putting up with my inability
to understand the concept of dead-
lines, promising six pages of high
quality features and delivering two
and half sides of spelling mistakes
and factual errors (sorry to those
writers whose work I inadvertadly
credited to myself, you know who
you are because I don’t). I hope the
incoming editor, Mr Rupert Neate
(he of fourth-floor library guy insult-
ing fame), can continue with the
high standards Dave has set.
I’d like to sound off with a quick
rundown of my personal favour-
ites from this year. First up, tak-
ing the award for best new band,
The Arcade Fire. I know the back-
lash has begun, but despite all that
Funeral is a superb record, and
their live show is one of the best I’ve
ever seen. Stars take the award for
best pop album – Set Yourself On
Fire is a bittersweet classic. In hip-
hop, Busdriver’s A Fear Of A Black
Tangent was astonishing; honorary
mention goes to 13&God for making
my Notwist/Themselves collabora-
tion fantasy come true. Folkwise,
Harris Newman’s Accidents With
Nature And Each Other was in my
ears for weeks. The guilty pleas-
ure award goes to Architecture In
Helsinki for In Case We Die, proving
tweeness doesn’t make you bad. I
could list some more, but these are
the ones that really stuck out.
Have a good summer, kids, and
don’t touch those mushrooms, no
matter what NME says.
