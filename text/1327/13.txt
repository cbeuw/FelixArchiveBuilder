RIP Southside Bar
I have tried to distance myself from
the Union politics hot potato that
Southside Bar has become, but I
can’t let the issue slide anymore.
I am personally devastated that
Southside Bar is to shut its doors for
the last time on 24 June. Southside
Bar is one of the very few things that
help Imperial maintain a passing
resemblance to a ‘normal’ universi-
ty’s social atmosphere.
When I was researching for my
original story on the closure of
Southside (Felix 1321), Mustafa Arif,
Union President, had a lot of excus-
es as to why Southside managed
to pack in the punters every night
of the week while the Union bars
remained empty.
His main reason was that the
rugby team only frequent Southside
because their honorary president,
Roger Pownall, is the bar manag-
er. This may account for some of
the Southside patrons, but I highly
doubt that most of Southside’s loyal
customers have any idea who Mr
Pownall is. I certainly didn’t.
I was out with some mates last
Friday, and for a reason that escapes
me now, we decided to go to the
Union. But Chav Night at the Union
had a door price of £3, so we decid-
ed against. Everyone knows Union
nights have been dreadful this year,
so charging people who are trying
to give it a go really isn’t the way
forward. £3 may not sound like a lot,
but compare it to £5 at Kings, UCL
and LSE, where you actually have
fun and which draw students from
all across London.
Instead we headed to Southside,
which was rammed. The bar, TV
room and even café area upstairs
were all occupied. Meanwhile, I’m
told Chav night was so unpopular
that dBs bar closed early. “There
was nobody in there,” according to a
Union steward.
The situation is only set to get
worse – all Union bars are set to
close sometime in the Summer term
next year, perhaps as early as the
start of the Easter holidays. This
will mean there will be no under-
graduate bars anywhere on campus!
Does the Union lack any concept of
foresight? How could the Union pos-
sibly consider the – albeit much over
due – refurbishment of Beit Quad at
a time when there will be no alterna-
tive places to go for a drink?
The issue I find most staggering
in the Southside Bar saga is that
the president of our Union, Mustafa
Arif, turned down the College’s sug-
gestion of moving Southside bar
into an extended Linstead bar. He
said that this would be “unfair on
Linstead students as they would
have no private communal space”.
But, having been a resident of two
different halls myself and chatting
to others, there is definitely much
better hall bonding and atmosphere
in halls that have bars.
It may be the case that students
who do not drink feel they cannot
socialise in bars, but, not to wanting
to over-generalise, these students
are hardly the most sociable what-
ever the situation.
This travesty of Southside’s clo-
sure should not be allowed to take
place, at least without a little bit
more of a public fight. Three thou-
sand signatures is a good start. I’m
sure that at another university if
the ‘powers that be’ attempted to
close down the most popular bar on
campus there would be some kind
of uprising. The apathy of students
at Imperial is incredible – no-one
gives a shit about anything, even
things that will greatly affect them
next year.
Southside halls were designed
specifically to prevent student riots.
Even in my wildest imagination I
cannot think of any cause against
which we Imperial students would
riot. Perhaps the library not being
open 24 hours any more?!
