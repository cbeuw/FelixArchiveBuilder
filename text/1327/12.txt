Comments from
another librarian
Dear Felix,
I have followed the recent cor-
respondence about the Central
Library, and the responses of senior
management, with great interest.
The Rector, in his interview with
Felix, brushed off the concerns
raised in the first of two anonymous
letters from central librarians. In
her letter last week, Clare Jenkins,
Director of Library Services, man-
aged to avoid any reference to the
letters at all.
In truth, neither the Rector nor
Ms Jenkins have dealt properly with
the central concerns raised in these
letters: how exactly is it in students’
interests to cram more depart-
mental libraries into the Central
Library, thus reducing the amount
of stock available for consultation,
and at the same time exacerbating
the problems caused by 24/7 open-
ing? And how can one of the pre-
mier educational establishments in
the country hope to maintain and
improve its reputation, when its
main library is allowed to degener-
ate into a third rate hostel.
Another issue raised in the first
letter was the “cavalier” treatment
meted out to the Science Museum
Library. It is undeniable that the
astronomical hike in the charge
made to the Science Museum for
its library’s occupancy of part of the
Central Library building has jeop-
ardised the library’s future.
Has the Rector, in his remorseless
drive to implement his vision of a
college fit to operate successfully
in the new global education market,
paused to consider that he is in
danger of sweeping away a valuable
resource for this and future gen-
erations of students, academics and
members of the public alike? The
Science Museum Library is one of
the foremost libraries for the histo-
ry of science and technology in the
world. The unique mix of material
it contains, built up over a period
of 120 years, will be destroyed if the
museum is forced to disperse the
collections.
Is it really part of the Rector’s
vision to see this valuable resource
lost to the national and wider inter-
national community?

Outrage at return of
smoking in Da Vinci’s
Dear Editor,
I want to state my disgust at the
decision announced last week that
the union will start allowing smok-
ing in the Da Vinci’s bar again.
I always thought that the student
union should be a progressive place
that would want to do what is best
for the students. The government
are making moves to implement
large scale smoking bans across the
country so why can’t the union take
a step forward and do it now.
According to last weeks Felix,
during the trial of the smoking ban
the union did not lose money from
the bar and also from the comments
sheets, more people supported the
smoking ban than opposed it. This in
itself is unusual as people will gen-
erally take more time to complain
about things than agree with them,
so the general consensus must be
even more in favour of the ban. I
even know people that have start-
ed going to the union specifically
because it’s the only non-smoking
bar in the area. So why, why, why,
would the union stop it?
The new rules allow smoking in
Da Vinci’s after 9pm but in my opin-
ion is the worst time! During lunch
time the level of smoking is low, the
only time it becomes unpleasant
and sometimes unbearable is on the
busy nights, so this should be the
times to target.
Passive smoking is proven to
cause damage to people’s health
and not only that, it is very unpleas-
ant for the non-smokers. Why should
the people who are intent on doing
harm to themselves have the right
to inflict this upon other students
who want to use the bar? Do the
union not care about this?

Dear Editor,
I’d like to express my regret that
the smoking ban was not left in
place in DV’s after the trial ban
ended recently. As an employee of
the Union Bars I enjoyed work-
ing in a smoke free environment, I
thought it was more pleasant and
just generally cleaner since there
was no smoking litter that needed
to be cleaned up.
Walking in between the Union Bar
and DV’s was utterly astounding
whilst the ban was in place... you
could actually see for the lack of
smog! It made for a much more
pleasant working (and drinking)
atmosphere.
Obviously going to a pub goes
hand in hand with a smoking envi-
ronment and that’s fair enough.
If people want to smoke then let
them. But the fact is they have 3
places to smoke whilst enjoying the
Union Bars. They have dB’s, the
Union Bar itself, and outdoors. Now
after 9pm non-smokers will have
no choice but to sit outdoors to get
away from the smoke. That’s all fine
and dandy during the summer but
what about winter?
According to last weeks article
Miss Misbahuddin says, “The ban
meant that running costs increased
at weekends, as extra staff were
needed to open the adjacent Union
Bar”. I work at the bar in question
and have done a number of week-
end shifts (both before the ban and
during) and I have to totally disa-
gree with that statement. As far as
I can remember there has always
been at least 3 staff in the DV’s and
the Union on weekends, one man-
aging and two bar staff. That has
always been the case and it is more
than enough to run both bars dur-
ing the weekends. The weekends
aren’t ever as busy as the weekdays
so two bar staff is more than enough
(one per bar). So how running costs
would increase over the weekends
is a total mystery to me. In fact what
she said implies that the Union Bar
was open especially to allow smok-
ers a place on the weekends. That’s
utter rubbish. The Union Bar has
always been open during weekends
to the best of my knowledge. It
was never opened just to cater for
smokers.
In fact during the ban I cant
remember there being a time when
business has ever been down solely
due to the fact that there has been
a smoking ban. I have to admit
that the ban was mostly during an
Easter break and the exam period
so an accurate calculation of the
loss in revenue due to the ban could
not be made. A fault of Union policy
and foolhardy planning, methinks,
but from working there I have to say
I have never noticed the difference.
I myself do not smoke so am obvi-
ously biased in favour of a smoking
ban. But its not like we would be
outlawing smoking altogether. As i
mentioned, smokers still have other
options within the union complex
with which to smoke and drink. But
why should non-smokers be limited
to enjoying their drinks until 9pm
only in a smoke free atmosphere?
Then they have no other alternative
but to leave.
It almost seems as though the you
are punishing non-smokers from
going to the union. It has always
been a god given right to have a
smoke with your drink at a pub, so
why should the reverse not be the
true for non smokers too?
A simple solution would be to
have DV’s smoke free permanently,
affording the non smokers a place
to enjoy themselves but also not
restricting the smokers to not smok-
ing. Obviously the Union Bar would
stay a smoking bar as would dB’s. I
don’t understand the financial or the
practical arguments against that.

DV’s & Union Bar bar staff
Sameena Misbahuddin, Deputy
President (Finance and Services),
responds:
Thank you for your letters.
Regarding the extra costs; dur-
ing the Easter holidays, usually
only DaVinci’s is open. However,
to maintain a room that smok-
ers could go to whilst there was
a smoking ban in DaVinci’s over
this period, the Union Bar was also
opened. The extra cost which was
incurred due to this was approxi-
mately £1000.
During term time on the week-
ends DaVinci’s is open on Saturday
and Sunday, but in the evening
of Sunday, DaVinci’s closes and
the Union Bar is opened. However
during the trial extra staff were
needed on the weekends in order
to allow both the Union Bar and
DaVinci’s to be open, to ensure
there was a no smoking bar as well
as a smoking bar.
When the Union deduced that
there was a loss of revenue, it obvi-
ously took into account the fact
that the ban spanned over Easter
holidays. Therefore when looking at
revenue it was compared to the fig-
ures from this time last year (and
the change in dates of last year’s
and this year’s holidays were also
taken into account). During the
discussions, details of last year’s
sales figures, this year’s figures
and trends so far this academic
year were all taken into account,
so it was not a simple decision to
make. On top of this, the feedback
from Yoursay was included.
Having looked at all the informa-
tion, there was no clear answer
– there was more favour for the ban
in the feedback through ‘Yoursay’,
but then the loss in trade indicat-
ed that students were going away
from the building. There were also
extra costs as well as a loss in
revenue.
As the resolution, it was decided
to continue with non-smoking from
9am to 9pm Monday to Friday. This
was in effect a compromise, as
there was not enough evidence that
a total ban was the correct decision
to make, whilst at the same time
not enough evidence that reverting
to smoking as before was the cor-
rect decision either.
However, in the proposals (which
are still in their early stages) for
the redevelopment of the Union
Building, the need for a non-smok-
ing area has already been iden-
tified by the Strategic Review.
But before the redevelopment of
the Union Building, the question
is what we do with the current
Union provisions. As a non-smoker
myself I understand your feelings,
but the committee could only go on
the evidence they have and try to
find a solution that will be the best
compromise.
Why McAloon missed the
point on poverty
Dear Editor,
I write in response to the article
by Stephen McAloon in last week’s
Felix, in which Mr McAloon crit-
icised the Make Poverty History
campaign and the plans for a rally
in Edinburgh to coincide with the
G8 finance ministers meeting.
Mr McAloon seems to have missed
the point of the campaign – which
is that the deaths of some thirty
thousand children every day from
extreme poverty is totally unaccept-
able. Poverty can be stopped – it is
within the powers of the G8 finance
ministers to help Africa. To can-
cel its crippling debts; to increase
aid and to make trade rules fairer
for African countries. The govern-
ments of the developed nations have
repeatedly failed to do this because
they do not see it as a high enough
priority. They have failed to stop this
suffering because, in their eyes, the
money is better spent elsewhere.
Our campaign aims to show world
leaders that the people of this coun-
try do indeed care about the people
of another – by whatever means
are necessary. That is why we will
gather in Edinburgh on the 2nd
July, whether it is convenient for Mr
McAloon or not. That is also why we
will wear bands on our wrists – to
advertise our campaign that others
may find out more and join, not to
flaunt our altruism as Mr McAloon
assumes. I would urge all to visit
www.makepovertyhistory.org and
join, because if you never make
your views heard then nothing will
ever change. Personal donations
are indeed an essential part of help-
ing the third world – as Mr McAloon
graciously acknowledges – but this
campaign asks only for your voice.
It asks you not to help Africa quietly,
as Mr McAloon suggests, but shout-
ing; shouting so loud that they can
hear it all the way in Gleneagles. Do
please stand up and be heard.

Responding to the
global warming sceptic
Dear Felix,
I was interested to see the interview
with Piers Corbyn in last week’s
Felix. Your article included two pho-
tographs of him: as a student politi-
cian, and as a sceptical scientist
opposing the consenus on climate
change. It is very appealing to imag-
ine that Piers might be a lone voice
of truth arguing against the vested
interests of a corrupt establishment
– but it is important to remember
that Pier’s track record is much
more as a politician than a scien-
tist. The question about whether we
should respond to global warning
by altering green house gas emis-
sion is one of the most important
questions facing the world at the
moment. There is now a rather frag-
ile scientific and political concensus
on this issue which Piers wants to
end. Whether or not Piers is right is
a very important question.
Piers is a very convincing speak-
er, and has a great skill at get-
ting people at a public meeting to
back his view against that of “the
establishment”. As an example,
two years ago, Piers was very suc-
cessful at bringing a £800million
redevelopment of one of London’s
worst estates (the Ayelsbury in
Southwark) to a grinding halt, by
catalizing a campaign against it on
the grounds that the proposed pub-
lic-private partnership constituted
“privatization” of the estate. I’m
sure he is very proud of his achieve-
ment, but the results? Not a better
estate, but one that continues to
have the same old problems, and
most pertinantly to me a lost oppor-
tunity to rebuild my local secondary
school, that is languishing at the
bottom of the league tables and
desparately in need of investment.
Piers certainly has the ability to sow
mistrust and stop things happening
– but as we consider Pier’s views on
global warming, we must make sure
we are doing so on the basis of the
science, not his rhetoric about vest-
ed interested and conspiracies. And
I personally am far from convinced
that his scentific track record mer-
its taking him seriously.
