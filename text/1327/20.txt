ALBUM REVIEW
The story so far: Dan Snaith, a
good friend of Mr Keiran Hebden
(aka Four Tet), and key member of
Hebden’s first band, Fridge, used
to be called Manitoba. His second
record, Up In Flames, was a storm-
ing blend of sixties psych, glitchy
IDM, and sunny shoegaze melodies,
and was lauded by many as one of
best records of 2003. Since a minor
confrontation with an old punk
singer, Handsome Dick Manitoba
(heard any of his records? No? Nor
have I), who tried to claim Snaith
was infringing his image, he simply
picked another Canadian placename
rather than fight.
So, Caribou is Manitoba. As anyone
who has heard both Up In Flames
and Start Breaking My Heart (his
debut) will attest, Snaith’s sound
changed massively in the two years
that separated them – the latter is
a mixture of pastoral electronica
and stoned beats, while the former
is a bombastic, rapturous affair. In
fact, you can barely tell they’re the
product of the same artist. Many
have speculated over what the next
step would be; more tripped out
shoegaze? More sixties references?
Hiphop beats? The answer, I can
now tell you, is all of these.
The Milk Of Human Kindness
buzzes with the same sunny, trippy
feel that made Up In Flames so
appealing. The opener, Yeti, jogs
along on a wall of distorted acous-
tic guitars (a previous trademark),
with Snaith’s vocals higher in the
mix than they’ve ever been before.
His voice, shorn of warping and
delay, is childlike and inviting: “His
greasy fingers strum together / and
stretching ‘cross the sky”. Utterly
nonsensical, but the vocal line is so
catchy you’ll find yourself singing
it for days afterwards. A sublimely
funky Rhodes line brings in a set of
cymbal-heavy jazz fills that’ll have
the inner drummer in you pounding
the desk with pencils, pens, mugs,
and anything nearby. I’m not kidding
– live, two drummers at the front
of the stage pretty much destroyed
their kits with complex breaks and
fills.
Brahminy Kite demonstrates
how superb Snaith’s production has
become. Whereas on Up In Flames,
certain components of the mix would
sound like they were clipping in his
effort to create such an engrossing
wall of sound, now he knows exactly
how and where to place the instru-
ments within the mix for maximum
effect. The shuffling, jazzy beats that
open the track are joined by a sump-
tuous flute harmony that makes a
huge grin spread across my face.
Bees showcases the additional six-
ties influence – the laidback cool of
its opening riff is completely famil-
iar, like it’s been plucked out of that
ether that the best pop songs seem
to exist in. Snaith builds a shell of
warm horn sounds, tremolo violins
and police sirens over an ascend-
ing melody, before bringing out his
trademark jazz breaks. Rather than
allow the song to explode into a
melodic cacophony, the drums are
reigned in and a gentle horn swell
brings the song to an unusually
restrained ending.
After the brief noise-attack of
Hands First, Hello Hammerheads
comes out of the blue, completely
unheralded by anything Snaith has
done before. Over a pair of gently
picked acoustic guitars and Simon
& Garfunkel vocals, he produces a
spectrally pretty tale of girl trouble,
humming a lilting melody over the
beautiful chorus.
Oh yes, the hiphop beats. Lord
Leopard, with its shout-sampling,
tight snare beats and sinister piano
sound, sounds almost like some-
thing RZA would turn out. Pelican
Narrows, the other instru-hop track,
sounds like an RJD2 outtake – the
filmic piano line and tense strings
ride a big, fat, vintage-sounding
drum loop. The breakdown even
features a harpsichord.
I know I always try to pick out
a high point from a record, but in
this case it’s almost impossible. I
haven’t even mentioned the continu-
ally shifting A Final Warning and its
“ahhhhhh” guitars, or the effortless-
ly superb freakout that is Barnowl
(well, OK, I have now). Put simply,
this is the perfect soundtrack to the
summer – play it loud and outdoors.

FEATURE
It wasn’t the easiest of times for
singer songwriter Keiran Scragg,
aka Iko, when his old band Buffseeds
dissolved at Christmas time. He
went from playing gigs in New York
to working in a factory during six
months of intense writer’s block.
Luckily for us, inspiration struck
and he headed back to the studio
with Buffseeds keyboardist Neil and
guitarist Rob to start recording the
songs he had lovingly penned on an
acoustic guitar in his bedroom.
The title of the album, I Am Zero,
is the title of a painting by his father
that tries to capture a perfect, emo-
tionless state. This spoke loudly to
his, at the time, depressed son, and
the songs started to flow. The album
itself is musically uplifting, but lyri-
cally often mournful and longing,
the combined effect painting a pic-
ture of the hope on the other side of
love and loss.
All of the songs are obviously
extremely personal, yet Keiran was
adverse to the idea of the album
becoming like an autobiography. “I
was looking on the net a lot, and
became fascinated with the idea
that Artificial Intelligence could
develop feelings of love”, he says.
“Yet this love would be extremely
detached”.
This idea of emotional detachment
is used in several ways throughout I
Am Zero. Many of the songs are
sung in character, so he is talking
about himself in the third person.
Also, the idea of Iko is that it is
a singer songwriter with a band,
so Keiran is Iko (compare to say
Aqualung, the name he personally
records under and the name of his
band). This alternative persona
allows him to remove himself from
personal memories of loss and sad-
ness.
The first track, Lovestruck, gives
you a good feel for the rest of the
album. Built up from light drums,
acoustic guitar, synth strings and
cello, it is extremely upbeat. The
song deals with the idea of impend-
ing disaster: “Iceberg ahead / look
away, look away”. Keiran admits
it also references the Christmas
Tsunami disaster, and of “life slip-
ping away from under you”.
In a similar vein, Hologram is
inspired by September 11th
(“Building fall down”) and the
breaching of America’s supreme
confidence (“Does anyone here
know a Superman?”). A trip to
Ground Zero had a profound effect
on the band: “it’s just such a large
space, and completely silent. Nobody
makes a noise, or beeps a horn.
Hologram is about the confusion
and anger surrounding that event”.
Nova has a different sound to the
rest of the album, in the fact that it
has much more of a whole-band feel,
with electric guitar and screaming
organ. In two of the verses Keiran’s
voice is distorted to great effect
(think of Matt Bellamy from Muse
screaming through a megaphone
in Feeling Good). It highlights the
theme of love and loss, with lyrics
like “Don’t shut me down / keep me
alive” mixed with “You’re the one
my soul craves”.
Musically I Am Zero tends to
swing between feel-good, upbeat
tracks (Lovestruck, All Time Low)
and touching, ethereal love songs.
Numbers is ghostly and tender, with
simple picked guitar and Keiran’s
vocals layered on top of themselves.
It breaks to just his voice at one
point, and the use of that often-
overlooked musical device: silence,
is spine-tingling. Damage Report
(Hymn at Deaths Door) is pos-
sibly the most beautiful moment
on the album. Consisting of lightly
strummed guitar and soft electric
organ, it does indeed almost sound
like a hymn. Keiran’s vocals are
at their best. It really tugs at you
when he sings, “The final curtain
has fallen on me,” and just lets his
voice crack and fade out.
Iko are planning to release the
album as soon as they can on the
internet, and to press, hopefully
securing a record deal. This proc-
ess will involve touring, which you
can initially expect to be in London
and Exeter (where they are based).
Friend Justin will join them on bass,
and Rob will take on drum duties.
They may even take a cellist! These
are gigs well worth your money,
since this kind of honest and emo-
tive song writing can never go out of
fashion. A soundtrack to your life.
