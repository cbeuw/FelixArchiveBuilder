SURVEY felix@ic.ac.uk
Twice his height
in beer
André Refig, a postgraduate student in mechanical engineering, won our survey prize
for the best suggestions on how to improve Felix. He told us that the Letters section was
his favourite part of the newspaper and suggested offering a prize for the best letter,
to encourage people to write in. He also suggested running reviews of pubs. His prize
(above) was twice his height in beer – 26 cans of John Smith’s.
Rachel Lambert, a third year biology student, won our random draw and will receive
half her weight in chocolate. Thanks to everyone who filled in the survey.
Clubs and
societies: send
your handbook

The Imperial College Union Handbook
is published over the summer and
mailed out to all UK-based freshers
before they arrive. All overseas-based
freshers get a copy on arrival, and
any student can take one from Union
reception throughout the year. Putting
an entry in the Handbook is a great
way to publicise your club, especially
to freshers.
We need...
1. A brief description of your club in
NO MORE THAN 200 WORDS. This
might include what the club does, why
freshers should join, where to find
the club (if applicable), dates/times/
locations of regular meetings, and any
other information you think necessary
2. Contact name
3. Contact email address
4. Club website address (if you have
one)
5. A good quality, high resolution
photo
6. PLEASE Let us know if you have any
special requirements, for example
regarding the name of your club. We
would usually remove words like
‘Imperial’ and ‘Union’ from club names
So, if you want your club to be
included in the Handbook, please
send the above to handbook@ic.ac.uk
