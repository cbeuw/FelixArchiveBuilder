I’d love to be able to say that math-
ematics and sex have been the
key features of my degree here
at Imperial, but sadly my recent
exams proved I’ve spent more time
thinking about one than the other.
To complement this, I’d like to rec-
ommend to you all Clio Cresswell’s
book, which provides a rationale
for the number crunching I’ve been
avoiding for the last three years.
Funnily enough, the word ‘sex’
is printed around five times larger
than the word ‘mathematics’ on the
front cover, and despite the old say-
ing this is a fairly good judge of its
content. Whilst I’m not normally
much of a fan of ‘popular’ science
books, I must admit this one did
tickle my fancy.
A fairly sedate start sees Clio
toying with the ideas of describing
the patterns of love with differen-
tial equations. Some of you may
be familiar with these ideas in the
context of population dynamics or
epidemiology: in this case, ‘love is
the drug’. Finally you can map your
fear of commitment or your desire
to be loved with a few extra terms
in an equation – ecstasy for any
Imperial geek.
Perhaps not so relevant is the dis-
cussion of how to know when to stop
hunting for a lifelong partner: is
she the one? Fortunately an answer
is at hand if you can reduce your
mate-finding situation to a string of
letters, and Clio explains why you
should road-test 12 people before
picking the next best one after that
to settle down with. Chat-up lines
are not included.
It’s not all just about hump-
ing though. For me, the climax
of the book was the chapter that
uses another meaning of ‘sex’ and
describes in detail some reasons
why there isn’t a ‘third gender’, but
that there might conceivably have
been one in the past.
The style is very light-hearted,
and the maths isn’t really derived
in the strict sense: it just tends
to be ‘here’s an impressive looking
equation for anyone looking over
your shoulder’, rather than expect-
ing you to understand it yourself.
Some of you will recognise parts of
it, but it’s all explained with sexu-
al abandon and includes snippets
of graph theory, game theory and
matching problems to whet your
appetite. The author seems intent
on seducing you to mathematics
with the promise of an understand-
ing of the female orgasm, but at
times her informal, chatty style just
equates to using multiple punctua-
tion marks (?!) and an ellipsis to end
each paragraph…
As one might expect, the final
chapter is entitled ‘Orgasm’, but
it’s by no means the highlight and
just seems to be a nod towards the
real reason why you picked up this
book.
As a general guide though, for
an entertaining book about sex,
relationship advice and tactics for
who to hit on at a celebrity party,
all with a light dusting of equa-
tions on top, look no further than
Mathematics and Sex. If you were
hoping for more diagrams, check
out Housewives Love Mechanics;
but if carefully defined Greek let-
ters do it for you then stick with
Berkshire’s Classical Mechanics.
