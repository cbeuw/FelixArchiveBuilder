Coffee Break
With David Hasselhoff
FUCWIT Results 2004-5 (the year of the Hoff)
The last Coffee Break of the year signals an end to our annual Felix Unforgettable Coffee Break Weekly Issued Tournament
(FUCWIT). We’ve had plenty of teams enter this year, all of which we’re sure are eagerly awaiting the final table. So here it is...
1st 2nd 3rd
Here are our winners, the all-
conquering Araldite Sniffers,
a team so efficient they make
Germans look lazy. Armed with
calculators, dandruff and Google,
for these guys no challenge is too
hard, no subject too obscure and
no anti-perspirant, ever. Without
girlfriends around to distract them,
they can devote maximum time to
their twin passions, Coffee Break
and internet porn. What more could
you want? Guys you’re worthy
winners and The Hoff salutes you.
For their efforts, the team wins a
shiny new iPod Shuffle and some
music to play on it. What music? The
Very Best Of David Hasselhoff. Oh,
we spoil you.
In second place we have the
warriors of Coffee Break, Smith &
Wesson. They might look meek
and mild-mannered, but Dragons
Beware! With Smith’s +5 Fire Lance
and Wesson’s mastery of the Dark
Arts (Pokemon Cards), there is no
puzzle they cannot defeat. As well
as an encyclopaedic knowledge of
Advanced D&D rules, they hold the
Holy Grail of Coffee Break teams:
premium membership at imdb.com.
Lucky guys.
For coming second, the team wins
a very cool pair of Battling Tanks,
which look pretty awesome to be
honest. They also get a soundtrack
to the carnage: The Very Best Of
David Hasselhoff.
Our third placed team are the
‘wacky’ Forever Throwing
Doubles guys and gals. Kind of
like the Addams Family, but with
more polyester, they like nothing
more than a crazy evening drinking
Ribena, eating cookies and listening
to Micheal Jackson songs. Losers.
That said, any team whose collective
DVD collection includes Mr Nanny,
Beverley Hills Ninja and Flubber will
always be welcome here.
As the third placed team, these
guys win a fantastic electric
shock lie detector machine. No
longer will arguments descent into
shenanigans at their house. They
also get The Very Best of David
Hasselhoff.
First thing’s first, thank you to all
the teams who entered the FUCWIT
competition, you’re superstars, one
and all. Even the rubbish teams
too.
Honourable mentions go to any
teams who decided to clog our inbox
with random Hoff-themed crap.
Though slightly disturbing, it’s all
good.
Also, if you’re wondering what hap-
pened to Coffee Break these past
two weeks, the Hoff, like so many of
you, had coursework to hand in.
Before we get on with the very
important issue of prizes, here are
the answers to issues 1323 and
1324.
Issue 1323 answers
Hoff’s Long Weekend
(Thanks to The House Of Earthly
Delights)
The Hoff kicked off his weekend by
desperately trying to convert a few
computer geeks to the lost cause of
the psychotic penguin (aka Linux).
What better place to start than at
a world-renowned, research-led
scientific institution like Imperial?
The dearth of the fair sex, however,
spelt disaster for his commendable
plans...
Breathless, he got on a conven-
tional plane (his beloved Concorde
having recently been ‘retired’) and
made it across the pond with a two-
week pregnant 21 year-old acquaint-
ance. He somehow found his way
to Texas, where the local abortion
clinic had oft proven its use to this
most fertile of males. Unfortunately,
a lack of money didn’t allow him to
proceed as planned...
Next stop, Miami, and, in a
rare departure from his blonde-
American-dream style bimbos, the
Hoff this time decided to see how
far his charms would get him in
attempting to seduce a nice look-
ing, Cuba-exiled young girl (he must
have heard the rumours entwin-
ing thick Cuban cigars, slim, under-
age female thighs and something
else I’m forgetting at the moment);
unfortunately, a distinct lack of alco-
hol (along with them seducing pills)
and an overtly jealous uncle meant
he had to swim all the 140km to
Cuba, board a military helicopter at
the Guantanamo Bay Army Base,
and hastily make his way across half
the globe to...
The New Model Republic of Iraq!
Hoping to play his part in spreading
freedom (not to mention his superi-
or genes) to this part of the world, he
aligned himself with the American
authorities in bringing about Iraqi
Freedom. The GI rush to secure
an autograph from The Man, how-
ever, spelt disaster for the efforts
underway (which was interpreted
in the rest of the world as a lack of
plan). Thus, the only nuclear power
in the region had yet to be made
to feel comprehensively safe and
secure...
Real Men
1. Rick Moranis, legendary star
of Scarface, Citizen Kane and
Anchorman, also played Wayne
Szalinski in the hard-hitting fact-
based drama Honey, I Shrunk The
Kids.
2. Chuck Norris, while he’s not busy
killing foreigners, blowing up for-
eigners or shagging attractive for-
eigners, likes to take time out to do
a little bit of acting. As well as crop-
ping up in Dodgeball he also plays a
transvestite hooker in the feel-good
hit of 1991, Walker, Texas Ranger.
3. Robocop is Alex Murphy, not Peter
Weller. Peter Weller is a fucking
actor, Robocop is the shit. That said,
my only memories of the film are of
him eating baby food.
4. The Chuckle Brothers, who are
brothers as their name suggests,
not father and son like some idiots
would have you beleive, originate
from lovely Rotherham. You can
catch them almost every day on
CBBC. Laughter is the best mnedi-
cine, and there is no better hango-
ver cure than watching Paul and
Barry trying to carry a grand piano
up some stairs. It’s comedy genius.
5. Hulk Hogan has been in several
films, but the most well known are
Mr Nanny, Suburban Commando
and my personal favourite, Three
Ninjas: High Noon at Mega
Mountain, an emotive tale of one
narcoleptic fighter pilot’s mission
for equality.
6. Homer’s middle name is Jay.
Duh.
7. The A-Team are great, and always
will be. As well as being Grade A
Soldiers of Fortune, their ability to
create cars, jet planes and rockets
from the contents of a simple locked
barn is a talent we can all envy. Face
was the missing guy.

Beard.

Morrissey.
Prizes!
Huge thanks to all our teams, you’ve
earnt some great prizes. The top
three have all won copies of The
Very Best Of David Hasselhoff and
some cool stuff besides (see above).
The rest of you have a choice of
a four-pack of lovely bottled lager,
some non-alcoholic equivalent, or
a copy of The Very Best Of David
Hasselhoff. I know what I’d pick.
If you’re intrested in writing for
Coffee Break next year, email the
editor at felix@ic.ac.uk.
So thank you all for reading and
have a great summer, as next year
is going to be yet another bad one at
Imperial. The Hoff may or may not
be back, it all depends on whever
he’s passed his software enginering
exam. See you and remember, viva
la revolution, save Southside!
