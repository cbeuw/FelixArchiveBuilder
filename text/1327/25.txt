A recent poll suggested that the
name Smith is deemed the most
common surname in the world.
Thus we could easily assume that a
couple with that surname would be
as common a couple as you can get.
Add some glamour to that and you
have two suave, rich, good looking
and articulate individuals who are
presented as the ultimate dream
couple. Or so it seems.
For a start, you wouldn’t want
these particular Smiths inviting you
over for dinner, since Mrs Smith
keeps a stash of lethal weapons in
a secret compartment in the oven.
Getting caught in the crossfire of
their domestic arguments can actu-
ally be life threatening.
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star
as Mr and Mrs Smith, assassins
leading double lives as a quiet sub-
urban couple married for “five or
six years”. However, their marriage
seems to be heading for trouble, as
they refuse to communicate with one
another about their lives. Their vis-
its to the marriage counsellor, which
appear in snapshots throughout the
film, give us an idea of the lack of
trust they have for each other.
In a twist of fate, the pair discov-
er that their next targets are each
other. Thus begins a high octane
adventure.
Jolie and Pitt carry the film very
well. Most of the attention and focus
are directed on them, and rightly
so, as their on-screen chemistry
sizzles. Both are funny and sexy,
so it is never boring seeing them
exchange comments and even gun-
fire. The movie goes to great length
to show off the two gorgeous heroes
in action with a final showdown that
is so reminiscent of other films of
this nature.
However, there does not seem to
be any development of the organisa-
tions that they work for, and the film
seemed to end on quite an abrupt
note without knowing how these
mysterious groups might inter-
fere with the couple’s lives again.
Perhaps it would have been a lot
more interesting to see how both
John and Jane Smith execute their
jobs on a daily basis.
The support cast did not seem to
have a lot of screen time and so the
viewer might find it hard to get to
know the characters.
In summary, there wasn’t anything
unexpected from this film but it was
still an entertaining watch. The plot,
although somewhat predictable,
still manage to deliver, due to both
Pitt and Jolie being so suited to
their roles. There is actually very
little substance to the film, but it still
serves up a good night out.

Angelina Jolie as Mrs Smith: get back in the kitchen, love
Fantastic for you?
Brad Pitt takes aim... at the woman he loves
This summer marks the release of
what’s said to be the most visu-
ally stunning comic book movie yet,
as Fantastic Four takes to the big
screen.
Whilst in outer space on an experi-
mental voyage, four astronauts get
bombarded with cosmic rays, grant-
ing them superpowers and changing
them forever. Scientific genius Reed
Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) gains the
ability to stretch and manipulate
his body and takes the name Mr
Fantastic. Reed’s girlfriend Sue
Storm (Jessica Alba) is granted the
power to become invisible and cre-
ate force fields, aptly naming her-
self The Invisible Woman. Sue’s hot-
head brother Johnny (Chris Evans)
becomes The Human Torch, able to
control fire and cover his entire body
with roaring flames. Reed’s best
friend Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis)
is transformed into a rock-like crea-
ture, gaining incredible strength as
a result and calling himself The
Thing. Together, they use their pow-
ers to try and foil the evil plans of Dr
Doom (Julian McMahon).
As a fan of movies in the comic
book genre, I have been anticipating
the release of Fantastic Four for a
while now and am sure I won’t be
disappointed with the results. The
movie promises to be eye candy,
with the attention to detail being
phenomenal. The Thing was created
using prosthetics rather than CGI
and achieves a unique look instead
of the incredibly fake Hulk. A lot of
time was also spent on making Mr
Fantastic’s stretching ability seem
real and giving it an awesome elas-
tic appearance.
As always with this type of
film, it is everybody’s wish that it
stays true to the comics. Fantastic
Four promises just that. Both as
a group and individually, the char-
acter development and relation-
ships are being kept just how they
should be.
I’m predicting that Fantastic Four
will be one of this summer’s big
films. If this article hasn’t made you
want to see it then I’ve got four more
words for you: Jessica Alba in lycra.
