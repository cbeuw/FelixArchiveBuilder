Imperial engineers helping make poverty history
Forget Geldof and Bono. Over the next few decades, today’s engineers will make the real changes.
Dan Wilson reports on an event promoting enginnering solutions to aid developing countries
It is estimated that more
than 1.1 billion people do not
have access to clean drink-
ing water. By heating water
to 65°C for five minutes the
water becomes pasteurised,
killing 99.999% of all harmful
bacteria – a simple yet neces-
sary process.
The Developing Technolo-
gies Department in Mech-
anical Engineering, headed
by Ron Dennis, is a registered
charity which aims to provide
engineering solutions to the
developing world. This year,
a group of third year Imperial
students embarked on devel-
oping a water pasteurising
unit for use in cookstoves in
rural parts of Nepal as their
‘Design, Make & Test’ project.
The project was run in con-
junction with a student from
the University of Tribhuvan
in Kathmandu, Nepal.
Back in December 2004,
the project was entered for
the Mondialogo Engineering
Award, an international con-
test organised by UNESCO
and DaimlerChrysler. The
award is an initiative aimed
at promoting intercultural
dialogue among young engi-
neers around the world.
The initiative calls on stu-
dents from industrialised
and developing countries to
work together on proposals
for sustainable engineering
applications to aid develop-
ing countries.
An international jury
assessed project ideas for
sustainability, feasibility
and quality of communica-
tion within the project group.
More than 1700 engineers
and students from 79 nations
registered for the contest,
forming 412 international
teams. From this, 40 final-
ists were selected in March
and two Imperial College
teams were lucky enough to
be nominated.
As the culmination of the
contest, the Mondialogo
Symposium was held in
Berlin on 27-30 May, and
two representatives from
the water pasteuriser team,
Dan Wilson and Marcus
Rafla, went along for the four
day event. A total of 65 par-
ticipants from 28 countries
attended, making it a truly
international event span-
ning both the industrialised
and developing worlds. The
Nepalese student, Sushobhan
Joshi, made the 4000 mile trip
and met his team mates face
to face for the first time .
Naturally, with Daimler
Chrysler being the owners
of Mercedes, the teams were
chauffeured around in their
fleet of S classes and put up
in a luxurious hotel – a wel-
come change to the London
Underground and student
living.
The Symposium consisted
of a mixture of sightseeing,
tours of the DaimlerChrysler
plant and lots of food and
drink to ease the intercultur-
al dialogue. On the last day,
a series of workshops took
place in order to exchange
ideas on the contributions of
engineering to sustainable
development and poverty
reduction, followed by the
prizegiving ceremony in the
evening. Held in Mercedes’
flagship showroom, the cer-
emony was a lavish event
overflowing with champagne
and, of course, nice cars.
The tension was high but
as the winners were called
to the stage it soon became
apparent that all 21 teams in
the attendance had won. All
teams received a prize fund
of €15000 along with the glory
of being an international
engineering award winner.
Congratulations go to the
entire team for all their hard
work: Dan Wilson, Jonathan
Tweed, Caroline Robertson,
Philip Wassouf, Marcus
Rafla, John Latham, Alex
Parker, Julian Soon and
Zaina Naboor. The prize
money is going to be used to
fund an expedition to Nepal
to carry out further research
and testing of the pasteuris-
ing device.
DaimlerChrysler has yet to
announce if it will support
another award next year, but
if this year is anything to go
by, it will be a storming suc-
cess.

Tam Dalyell leaves, New Scientist loses political edge
Zoë Corbyn discovers that ‘National Enquirer of science magazines’ will not replace its
long-serving political columnist

For more than 36 years, par-
liament’s greatest dissenter,
Tam Dalyell, has been bring-
ing another dimension to
New Scientist magazine with
his column, ‘Westminster
Diary’.
He has shown us science
from the inside, highlighting
the issues on the lips of the
politicians in the corridors of
power and doing his utmost
to goad them into action.
But while the Labour back-
bencher may have retired at
the last election – duly leav-
ing the House of Commons
in April 2005 – it seems that
New Scientist has also per-
manently retired his column.
‘Westminster Diary’, the last
of which appeared last month,
is no more.
But why not find a replace-
ment columnist? According to
Michael Bond, Opinion Senior
Editor at New Scientist, the
answer appears twofold.
Firstly, “Dalyell is pretty irre-
placeable frankly. Because he
was Father of the House, he
had all the experience and
incredible access to politi-
cians. There was no-one real-
ly suitable on that level.”
But New Scientist also
envisages itself doing some-
thing different with the
pages. According to Bond,
it is not to say that in the
future there won’t be people
in Westminster writing about
politics, but “political cover-
age will come in different for-
mats rather than just through
one column, for example an
opinion piece from a politician
or an analysis.”
So Dalyell is an irreplace-
able columnist, and it is only
one column after all... but
the plot thickens. It seems
‘Westminster Diary’ is not
the only political column
New Scientist has axed.
‘Washington Diary’, provid-
ing the inside story on the
American political scene
since 1994, has also made
a departure. Andreas Frew
(alias Chris Joyce and Joe
Palca from the National Public
Radio science desk) had their
last regular spot at the end of
May too.
So is New Scientist mov-
ing away from the politics of
science? All we can do now
is speculate and wait to see.
Perhaps this just a freak
New Scientist blip, or per-
haps it will herald the begin-
nings of a new chapter for the
magazine: science minus the
politics.
New Scientist has dumped its political columns,
‘Westminster Diary’ and ‘Washington Diary’
