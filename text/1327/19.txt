Hey Matty

Hey James
Indier than Thou says:
Did you enjoy the Leaves gig the
other night?
Me=Post-Rock says:
I did, I thought it was quite
special, I’m glad I missed The:
Hair, or should I say The Colon
Hair
Me=Post-Rock says:
Lol
Indier than Thou says:
rofl they reminded me of some
thing, can’t quite put my finger
on it...
Me=Post-Rock says:
the past?
Indier than Thou says:
That’s it, the smooth sound of
2002
Me=Post-Rock says:
smooth? more like garage rock
tinniness
Me=Post-Rock says:
lol
Indier than Thou says:
Yup, I quite liked the Buffalo Bar,
despite the smell of stale vomit
Me=Post-Rock says:
rofl, it did follow us around the
room like a middle-aged gay guy
in Clapham
Indier than Thou says:
Ha! So, onto business. Did you
know the Leaves are Icelandic?
Which means they spend half the
year in TOTAL DARKNESS!
Indier than Thou says:
(Better than being in The
Darkness)
Me=Post-Rock says:
rofl, omg it must be crazy, how do
owls and other nocturnal
creatures like the humble badger
cope with it? They must be
incredibly tired from the 24 hour
foraging in the undergrowth
Indier than Thou says:
I never thought of it from their
angle! So, do you remember
Leaves the first time around?
Indier than Thou says:
With their smooth sounds of 2002
Me=Post-Rock says:
I do, 2002 is obviously back in, I
did however notice a resemblance
to Coldplay which felt out of place
at the time of the new rock
revolution
Indier than Thou says:
I agree. But they were more
atmospheric than the Chris
Martin Show. I can’t believe how
much Leaves have changed in
three years!
Me=Post-Rock says:
Yeah, they must have tripped over
the Post-Rock Rule Book as
written by Explosions in the Sky
and Godspeed You! Black
Emperor, i.e. lots of snare, lots of
strings and cool noises and plenty
of climax
Me=Post-Rock says:
more 1998 than 2002
Indier than Thou says:
lmao Though they know how to
write ‘em short as well. The Spell
for example was ace, and only
about four mins long. Do you
remember that one, With the
slamming piano and fuzz bass? I
think it comes out soon as a
single.
Me=Post-Rock says:
I hope that is a plug because I’m
sold!
Me=Post-Rock says:
Lol
Indier than Thou says:
Indeed, I’m expecting my cheque
from Island Records any day now!
So onwards and upwards, what
did you think of the band? Some
of them were a bit scary lookin’
Me=Post-Rock says:
Yeah, being Icelandic must be a
very miserable experience. They
looked so grumpy they make
Thom Yorke look like a prozac
addict
Indier than Thou says:
Mmm, prozac. I think I’d be pretty
miserable playing the tiny Buffalo
Bar, and being supported by a
band called The Colon Hair.
Their singer had a pretty amazing
voice.
Me=Post-Rock says:
It must be annoying have epic
music confined to a few square
metres of taste-deprived
decorated basement space and
those lads with the digestive
tract disorder just heighten the
filthy ambience. His voice was
very powerful, even though at
times he seemed drowned out by
the Rock and the Roll he
managed admirably those high
notes.
Me=Post-Rock says:
...and he has a TOIGHT body
YESH!
Indier than Thou says:
Very droll Matty. I have to say it, I
was blown away by their set
closer Shakma. So good. You can’t
fault a good snare drum.
Me=Post-Rock says:
It is one of those songs which
manages to defy time, when it
ends you haven’t realised how
much time has passed and you
never want the song to come
down.
Indier than Thou says:
Do you think they’ll manage to
graze the charts? I though Good
Enough sounded radio-wor
thy. Sing along chorus et al. And if
Athlete can do it...
Me=Post-Rock says:
I’m not so sure, aspects of each
and every song I think require
time to engross you like with a
lot of good music. It can be hard
to digest for the Athlete loving
unambitious ear of the chart
makers i.e. the public
Me=Post-Rock says:
Other bits which seem accessible
come across as a poor imitation of
Coldplay still. But they are
carving their own impressive
sound.
Indier than Thou says:
I guess so. But album sales are
often more indicitive of quality,
and their newey Angela Test
comes out in August. We shall
see.
Me=Post-Rock says:
Yeah, I believe the album will be
more indicative of whether they
sink into the public’s imagination.
After all, there is a market for
those who like Sigur Ros but
need something more accessible
at times.
Me=Post-Rock says:
The Colon Hair however I think
will be destined to the fate of most
2002 garage rock bands:
eventually having a bath
Indier than Thou says:
God, I hope they’re not even
signed! Well there you have it
then. Leaves, uniting the musical
taste of Imperial’s indie boys and
post-rockers. Oops, did I just use
plural?
Me=Post-Rock says:
You did, they are out there
somewhere. They are just stuck
inside the body of Kaiser Chiefs
loving scallywags.
Indier than Thou says:
Bless their cotton socks. Bye bye
Matty

ttfn James
James Millen and
Matty Hoban
If you were to approach the aver-
age man in the street and ask him,
“Who do you associate with East
17?”, chances are that he’ll ramble
on about a pisspoor boy band from
the early nineties, whose lead singer
hilariously fell from grace after mak-
ing a faux pas over ecstasy.
However, E17 (featuring the sub-
urb of Walthamstow) is also the
home of up-and-coming band The
Rifles. Firing as part of the latest vol-
ley of London rock groups, they fol-
low the current trend of recognising
and paying homage to the punkera,
with various magazines comparing
them to classic acts like The Clash
and The Jam. If this description
sounds too much like The Others for
your liking, don’t worry; their songs
tend to reflect a more personal line
rather then harking on about how
cool they are.
Arriving on stage after some
strong support courtesy of The Izzys
and trippy rockers Trap 2, the band
form an immediate attraction with
the crowd, with the four piece shak-
ing hands and hugging more excit-
able members of the crowd, allow-
ing people up on stage to, ahem,
‘skank’ during the more jumpy num-
bers, such as ska flashback Lazy
Days, which is the perfect anthem
for those care-free post exam days
you’ll have.
In fact, with their ska influences
The Rifles could be seen as a mod-
ern day Specials, and this is most
obvious on Repeat Offender, with a
menacing bassline steamrolling the
song along and the theme of ado-
lescent hooliganism apparent from
the title.
Their main strength comes from
their ability to make catchy, shouty
music which accurately captures
the spirit of London circa 1977. Just
take the performance of their first
single, Peace and Quiet, which, fol-
lowing a swift drum intro, breaks
into a series of swaggering gui-
tars which has the whole crowd
jumping like crazy, as the songs
builds up to its strong point, the
anthemic “…All I want is a little
peace and quiet!” as its chorus. This
is not a one off: when the B-side
Breakdown is played later in the
set, all the elements combine again
to make another astounding live
track.
Unfortunately the set flies by too
quickly, and after the forthcoming
single When I’m Alone is finished
the crowd surround the stage so
the band can’t leave to do the whole
‘we’re just popping off before we
play our encore’ routine, forcing
them into the final track, the haunt-
ing Lost In London.
The Rifles are playing a succes-
sion of gigs around the country in
the forthcoming months, and this
reporter urges you to go out and
catch their brash rock music whilst
you can, being a welcome and
upcoming addition to the popular
music canon.
Oh, and as a final note, if anyone
from the 100 Club happens to be
reading this, can you please sort
out your chairs and the toilets? The
former made my back ache, while
the latter required wellies to navi-
gate. Shame on you.
