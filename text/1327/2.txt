team of people working with
me on Felix this year and I’m
pleased to be rewarded for
what we’ve done. We made
a lot of changes and most of
them have gone down very
well. I hope everyone has
enjoyed reading the newspa-
per as much as we’ve enjoyed
putting it together.”

Transport trouble for
clubs and societies
By Dave Edwards
Editor
Imperial College Union clubs
and societies face transport
difficulties next year as the
number of parking spaces
available for minibuses is
cut.
The College currently has
342 parking spaces on its
South Kensington campus.
98 of those will be unavail-
able while Southside is being
redeveloped, so all depart-
ments and faculties are hav-
ing their number of spaces
cut by around one third.
However, the Union faces a
much greater reduction, from
ten spaces to just four.
The Union currently owns
nine minibuses that are
based in South Kensington,
behind Linstead Hall. With
the demolition of Southside,
five of those will be moved to
Wilson House in Paddington.
Dan Lehmann, the Union’s
Transport Manager, claims
that this will “add nearly two
hours to the trip” and hence
“severely restrict student
activity”.
Mr Lehmann also said:
“All equipment is based in
South Kensington, as are 98%
of minibus users, so leaving
from Wilson House is totally
impractical.” He explained
that many drivers are female
and it would be dangerous for
them to have to walk back to
South Kensington at night.
Diana Pinn, Assistant
Director of Estates, told Felix:
“Everybody is unhappy about
the car parking. We have a
limited number of spaces
and we just can’t fit every-
body in. I sympathise with
the Union’s predicament, but
in discussions we’ve had, I
have not heard them make
one concession. The Union
has grown its number of vans
over the years without any
authority, I’m told.”
Miss Pinn added: “We’ve
got a breathing space
until November [when the
Southside spaces are lost] to
try to sort this out.”
Mustafa Arif, President of
Imperial College Union, said
he was “confident of resolv-
ing the issue by November”.
● Comment, page 10
Imperial College Union clubs, societies and other groups rely heavily upon the Union’s minibus fleet for transport.
Under College proposals, the majority of the minibuses will be relocated to Wilson House in Paddington
