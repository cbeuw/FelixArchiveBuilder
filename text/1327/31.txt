Mixed tournament
By Pikey
OnSaturday28May,Imperial’s
finest hockey players (well
those who didn’t have exams,
projects or the sense to say no
to getting up early) travelled
to Chigwell to play in an inter-
club mixed tournament at Old
Loughtonians hockey club.
For those of you who didn’t
do A-level geography or have
never been outside the Circle
Line, Chigwell is in Essex,
“mate”. Luckily we had our
own Essex Wideboy to see
that we safely made our way
from Black Horse Road tube
to the pitches in a fleet of taxis
without getting run over by
boy racers in their modified
Ford Escorts.
We arrived in true Imperial
fashion just before push-back
for our first game, thus negat-
ing the need for a warm-up
as has become traditional.
However, I was reliably
informed by the Old Loughts
groundsman that Brandon
Lee (who had made his own
way there) had been at the
gates at 7.30am to practice his
drag-flicks from shot corners.
Didn’t anyone tell him that
girls have to have the first
strike in mixed? Oh well.
More importantly we only
had 10 players, which doesn’t
make a team. Fortunately
Pikey’s skills at chatting
up young girls and Essex
Wideboy’s charm in being at
his home club meant that we
managed to get two girls from
Old Loughts to play for us
throughout the day. Thanks to
Vicki and Laura!
The first match was une-
ventful, largely because we
were all sluggish and they
were rubbish. We scored
first as Moony, our very own
lady in pink, coolly slotted
home from the tightest of
angles. We weathered their
comeback storm with Sieve
impressive in goal and Sarah
C, Spanner and the Italian
Job forming a solid defence.
However, a short period
of sloppy play lead to the
Redbridge Redskins equalis-
ing. (Sounds like something
out of a Budweiser ad doesn’t
it.) Unfortunately there was
no added-time multi-ball,
much to our disappointment,
so the game ended 1-1. One
point to start.
The second game was
against a team calling them-
selves Welcome. We played
this game on the water-
based pitch rather than the
usual sand. We won 2-0 with
goals from Pikey and Essex
Wideboy who, along with
Stoner Tom, dominated the
midfield. Too Keen kept us all
fresh by subbing on and off,
showing some nice touches.
Our final game was against
one of the Old Lought’s teams.
The less said about the game
the better. It ended in a 0-0
stalemate though not for a
lack of trying and the fact that
the Old Lought’s team had
an awesome goalkeeper who
turned out to be a bit of stun-
ner when she took her helmet
off, according to Sieve.
So we had five points at
the end of the group games,
which put us in second place
in the table, meaning that we
progressed through to the
Cup playoffs. As a result, in
our minds we were already
winners. Just as well, because
the team we drew in the
semis was Mill Hill who had
thrashed all the teams in their
group.
The game was excellent,
although our efforts were
somewhat thwarted by Essex
Wideboy who decided to slice
a free hit into Pikey’s knee
and the fact that they had
a ‘supposed’ national league
player in their team. The final
score was a 2-0 defeat, though
in true Imperial fashion we
never gave up fighting, espe-
cially Moony who had an awe-
some bitch at the rather large
female umpire. Mill Hill went
on to win the tournament so
we lost to the best team, obvi-
ously!
