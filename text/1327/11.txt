Goodbye
DAVE EDWARDS
EDITOR
EDITORIAL
Well, that’s it. After 29 issues, 700
pages and something like three
quarters of a million words, the
Felix year comes to an end.
I first wrote for Felix back in 2000,
142 issues ago, and I’m pleased
to have been a regular contribu-
tor ever since. The newspaper has
been a big part of my life and I’m
going to miss it. Working here has
taught me a huge amount, not only
about putting publications together,
but also about managing teams,
understanding Union politics and
staying up until stupid hours of the
morning.
I’m proud of what we’ve achieved
with Felix this year. We made a
lot of changes, most notably the
change from magazine to newsprint
which could have backfired hor-
ribly, but I think we’ve been suc-
cessful. I believe Felix has become
a well-respected, well-written
and well-read student newspaper.
Preliminary results from our survey
suggest that you agree.
Everyone here is pleased to have
been given the President’s Award
– it’s an honour to be singled out of
Imperial’s 250 fantastic student-run
clubs and societies.
I would like to thank every single
person who has contributed to Felix
in any way over the past year. The
newspaper could not exist without
the time, effort and enthusiasm of
our excellent team of volunteers.
There is no way I can list them all,
because there are too many, but
I must mention my eight regular
section editors – Numaan, Darius,
Andy, Simon, Paola, Martin, Alan
and Shaun – who were a pleasure to
work with, week after week.
Thanks to the other sabbati-
cals and the Union staff for their
help throughout the year. Thanks
to everyone who helped produce
the Union Handbook 2004 and our
new magazine I, Science. Thanks
to Alisdair Wren for running and
revamping our website. And thanks
to everyone who has kept me com-
pany on a long Tuesday night.
Whoever you are, and whatever
you think of Felix, I hope we’ve
managed to provide you with some
combination of information and
entertainment during your studies.
If you’re leaving Imperial, best of
luck for the future.
Finally, just to create a bit of sym-
metry with my first editorial and to
prove that we don’t always learn
from our mistakes, guess what time
it is. Yes, it’s 5am again. Thanks for
reading.
I hardly think that a few pop stars
could do a worse job on global pov-
erty than the economists have done
so far. Surely, humanity’s greatest
failing as we move into the 21st cen-
tury is the shocking fact that as the
world becomes richer and richer, the
gap between rich and poor becomes
wider and wider. Never have we
been so rich. Never have there been
so many suffering and dying from
poverty. This is not an ideological
point – it is a point of fact.
Last weeks article (‘Making eco-
nomics history?’) suggested that the
solution lies with the economists.
We would do well to recall the leaked
memo written by the chief econo-
mist of the World Bank in December
1991, Larry Summers (now presi-
dent of Harvard University – the
man who recently made the contro-
versial comments about women in
science). He argued that the World
Bank should be encouraging the
migration of “dirty industries” to
the “Less Developed Countries
(LDCs)”, for which he gave three
reasons.
Firstly, it is only rational that the
increased morbidity and mortality
caused by health-impairing pollu-
tion should occur in a country with
the lowest costs, and hence the
lowest wages. “I think the economic
logic behind dumping a load of toxic
waste in the lowest wage country
is impeccable and we should face
up to that.” He then says we should
attempt to distribute pollution more
evenly across the world, regardless
of its source: “I’ve always thought
that under-populated countries in
Africa are vastly under-polluted,
their air quality is probably vastly
inefficiently low compared to Los
Angeles or Mexico City”. Finally
he explains that in countries where
the life expectancy is low already,
the increased risk of prostate can-
cer is no cause for concern. In
other words, the poor don’t mat-
ter at all – their lives are just not
economically useful. For the full
memo see www.counterpunch.org/
summers.html.
Jose Lutzenburger (then Brazil’s
Secretary of the Environment)
replied to Summers, saying: “Your
thoughts [provide] a concrete exam-
ple of the unbelievable alienation,
reductionist thinking, social ruth-
lessness and the arrogant ignorance
of many conventional ‘economists’
concerning the nature of the world
we live in.” I think this sums it up
perfectly.
Summers closes his memo with
the following statement: “The prob-
lem with the arguments against all
of these proposals for more pol-
lution in LDCs (intrinsic rights to
certain goods, moral reasons, social
concerns, lack of adequate mar-
kets, etc) could be turned around
and used more or less effectively
against every Bank proposal for
liberalisation.” From this we should
take our cue.
So, hang your hopes for the poor
on these economists if you will.
Alternatively, you could face up to
the reality that to a large extent pov-
erty is exacerbated, if not caused, by
the policies of the rich nations. As
such, the best hope for the future
is for the citizens of these nations
to dismantle the deceit in which we
have become embroiled, and refuse
to accept this. It is not complicated.
You do not need a PhD in economics
to understand the problems. It is
simply a question of politics, that is,
the competing interests of the rich
and powerful with the rest of us. We
live in a free and democratic country
– we have power and we have the
responsibility to act. If we do not,
no-one else will.
● Students from Imperial are going
up to the G8 summit in Edinburgh
and Gleneagles from 2 to 6 July to
join the protests and make our voic-
es, and the voices of the poor, heard.
Travel and the conference are sub-
sidised by the Union so please con-
sider joining us. Contact cs602@ic.

join us.
Making economics history!
Andrew Ireson responds to last week’s criticism of the Make Poverty History campaign
“Face the reality
that poverty is
exacerbated, if not
caused, by the policies
of the rich nations”
“We live in a free and
democratic country.
We have the power
to act. If we do not,
no-one else will”
Farewell statement
For many of you, this will be the
last issue of Felix you read whilst at
Imperial College. That’s certainly
the case for me. This is the last
issue of term and on 31 July I leave
Imperial after nearly six years.
Appreciation
There are many people who I need
to thank for their support, guidance
and mentoring during my time at
College. Inevitably I shall forget
to mention, or allude, to someone
and for that I can only apologise in
advance.
I wouldn’t be here now if I hadn’t
graduated in Information Systems
Engineering and I therefore owe a
debt to staff and fellow students in
the Departments of Computing and
Electrical Engineering. In particu-
lar Peter Cheung, the Director of
Undergraduate Studies and many
other lecturers for the frequent
coursework extensions I had to ask
for because I was too busy running
some part or other of the Union’s
activities as a volunteer.
Dinesh Ganesearajah was
President of City & Guilds College
Union in my first year in 1999-2000.
He was the first (and only) C&G
President to have been re-elected to
a second term (2000-2001). Dinesh
was not the average Union ‘hack’
and had precious little time for
lengthy debates in Council meetings
or other politicking. Whilst others
would worry about the precise rules
enshrined in the Union’s constitu-
tion, he would just ignore it and just
focus on doing whatever he believed
to be in the best interests of stu-
dents.
It was a philosophy that I con-
tinued when I succeeded him and,
controversially, adopted later as
President of Imperial College Union.
Some will have read of some of the
ensuing political fallout from the
pages of Felix this year. But ulti-
mately, this laissez-faire attitude to
the finer points of the rules secured
the highest ever turnouts in all
Union elections this year, one of the
first successful transitions to online
voting in any students’ union, and
ultimately many more students get-
ting involved in the business of the
Union’s democratic processes.
The Union is nothing without its
volunteers or the staff who facili-
tate them. During my years as a
Union Officer I am fortunate to have
worked with many other co-opera-
tive, talented and supportive col-
leagues who I can’t possibly list. I
have publicly recognised most in
one way or another. Those I have
never mentioned include Chris
Piper, former President of King’s
College Union, who was President of
ULU (University of London Union)
last year and provided support
and guidance in difficult circum-
stances. Sir Graeme Davies, the
Vice-Chancellor of the University
of London, also gave me invalu-
able advice in dealing with difficult
circumstances in the College. My
Deputies over the last two years
(Richard, Mike, Sam and Sameena)
have displayed remarkable patience
with me and have been a tremen-
dous support.
Despite sometimes being at log-
gerheads over student issues, and
the occasional public disagreement,
I have managed to maintain cordial
relations with most senior College
staff. In fact they have often been
very supportive when I have been
able to articulate a strong student
case. To that end I would like to place
on record my thanks to Sir Richard
Sykes, the Rector, as well Professor
Chris Hankin, now a Pro Rector but
Dean of City & Guilds College when
I was C&G President. Several other
senior College staff are mentioned
elsewhere but I would also like to
thank Heather Allan and her team
at ICT, Chris Gosling and his HR
staff, and Hameed Khan’s financial
accountants for their invaluable
assistance this last year.
Finally I ought to thank my friends
and family for their endurance.
Buried away in College and Union
activity I have probably neglected
those closest to me over the last
two years and I am grateful for their
patience in accepting what is impor-
tant to me.
Final remarks
I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at
Imperial. It’s sad for me to be leav-
ing after so long. You can become
very attached to an institution that
you’ve put your life and soul into and
I’d be lying if I didn’t admit to shed-
ding a few tears whilst writing this
column. Nevertheless I’m also glad
that it is time for me to be moving on
to new challenges.
I imagine I might get a party invite
to the College (and Union’s) cente-
nary celebrations in 2007, but my
involvement is otherwise at an end.
It’s been an honour and a privilege
to serve as your President for two
years but the time has come for
me to pass the baton on. I wish the
Union, and Imperial as a whole, the
very best of luck. Sameena, it’s over
to you.
