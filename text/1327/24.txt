EXHIBITION
You would have to try exception-
ally hard to miss the hype around
the new Frida Kahlo exhibition at
the Tate Modern. It’s everywhere
– newspapers, glossy magazines,
television and posters around town.
The thing is, after the period a
few years ago when Mexico was the
‘fashionable’ country to visit, and
then the Salma Hayek biopic, Frida
has come back with vengeance.
She’s a quirky fashion-pack favour-
ite, feminist and left wing activists
adopt her as their own (she did after
all belong to the Communist Party
and was a very independent woman
given the standards of the time).
Her paintings fetch the highest pric-
es by any female artist and her work
is collected by celebrities.
The show at the Tate Modern col-
lects an impressive array of Kahlo’s
work – there are 62 paintings and
numerous sketches. There are
paintings loaned from numerous
museums in Mexico as well as from
private collectors such as Madonna.
Also included are sketches and pen-
cil drawings as well as some water-
colours which show yet another
facet of the artist’s style – her water-
colours are almost unrecognisable
as the work of the same woman.
The contents are arranged prima-
rily in chronological order but with
some rooms dedicated to a certain
theme, such as self-portraiture and
still-life paintings. The exhibition’s
curators have done well in adopt-
ing this scheme as it allows for a
good examination of the develop-
ment of the artist’s style. However,
much of the explanatory tags and
so forth accompanying the exhibits
often reek of over-analysis of the
works by parties not having a proper
understanding of the culture that
influenced the artist so strongly.
The general spouting of rubbish
regarding Kahlo’s art, life and influ-
ences is regrettably not limited to
the official gallery blurbs – both The
Times and The Independent have
carried sadly pretentious articles
and the coverage given by the BBC
was laughably inaccurate, show-
casing the corporation’s employ-
ees’ inability to even read a press
release.
The impact on Kahlo’s art of being
mixed race is over-emphasised
(pretty much every Mexican is part
European and part indigenous),
where in fact more focus should
really be placed on her passion for
her country and its culture. She
is criticised for being narcissistic,
using herself as the subject many
of her paintings; she was, after all,
often bedridden and the wife of a
brilliant, though womanising, fellow
artist, she spent most of her time
alone. She painted what she knew
best and what was at hand – her-
self.
Kahlo (1907-1954) began paint-
ing after suffering a hideous road
accident in 1925 (I’d rather not go
into the specifics, as just thinking
about it makes me nauseous), to
allay terminal boredom. The second
room of the exhibition is dedicated
to the paintings of this early period
of exploration and development of
style and themes – the works of the
1920s are remarkably different from
those of the more mature Kahlo.
Her painting style, particularly in
oils, changed dramatically after she
met and later married the already
larger than life muralist legend
Diego Rivera. Her experiences as
his wife and his influence and guid-
ance on her work are clearly vis-
ible. The period spent with her hus-
band in the United States led her to
become ‘more Mexican’ as she felt
homesick and out of place, and also
added to her list of personal trag-
edies as she suffered a miscarriage.
Kahlo’s art is essentially a reflec-
tion of her life and her feelings
towards herself and those in her life;
her art is not complicated, as many
would encourage you to believe,
it is raw. She paints of her happy
moments, Frida Kahlo y Diego
Rivera (1931) on the event of her
wedding, and her almost constant
sadness and pain, La columna rota
(1944).
The work collected for the show
is very wide ranging and does allow
for a real insight into the life of Frida
Kahlo. Most interesting to see are
her changing attitudes to herself
and Rivera. These are clearly docu-
mented by the numerous names
she uses when signing her paint-
ings; they reflect periods of love
and loathing and of finally coming
to terms with herself as a person.
Her issues are not so much of an
identity crisis arising from a mixed
heritage – she chooses to call her-
self by her more Germanic name,
Frida, instead of Carmen while her
dressing reflected the regional cos-
tume of different parts of Mexico
– but more from problems she had
in accepting herself as an individual
in a physically damaged state.
The exhibition is thoroughly inter-
esting and is also a unique chance
to see so much of Kahlo’s work
collected in one place. She remains
an iconic figure within Mexico and
her family home, La Casa Azul in
Coyoacán, as well as the home she
shared with Diego Rivera in San
Angel, (both are suburbs of Mexico
City these days), are preserved and
open to the public.
A parting word: please avoid buy-
ing any of the Mexican handicrafts
on sale at the Tate Modern. You will
be royally ripped off and a trip to
Mexico would be far more reward-
ing anyway. Paola Smith

Raising an eyebrow
Cult icon Frida Kahlo is back in town
If, like me, you’ve finished your
exams and recovered from the
hangover enough to brave the sum-
mer sun outside, you may have some
time on your hands and the inclina-
tion to get out and do something a
bit different. Well, London’s parks
offer the perfect solution, and I don’t
just mean taking a crate and lying
around in Battersea all day. There
are events all summer long, many of
them free, all over the capital, and it
seems a shame not to take advan-
tage really...
Hyde Park has by far the full-
est calendar, with something going
on at least once a week until the
middle of September. There are
concerts from REM, Queen and
Paul Rodgers, Live8 as well as the
O2 Wireless Music Festival on 24,
25, 29 and 30 June. Later on in
September there will be Proms in
the Park, including a last night host-
ed by Terry Wogan with the tenor
Andreas Bocelli and the violinist
Nicola Benedetti.
Continuing on a musical note,
Kensington Gardens is hosting
classical wind and brass ensem-
bles every Sunday from 19 June on
its bandstand, whilst Bushy Park
(near Teddington) is holding an
afternoon of jazz on the 26th. St
James’s Park, Battersea Park and
Regent’s Park also have extensive
bandstand programmes, including
the National Youth Jazz Orchestra
on 14 July.
Regent’s Park is hosting the free
festival Fruitstock on 6 and 7 August,
which promises to be a weekend of
“music, smoothies and maybe even
love” and was voted the Best Live
Event of 2004 (according to its web-
site). There will also be 2 perform-
ances of Rossini’s Cinderella (La
Cenerentola) by the Garden Opera
Company on 3 and 17 July, with tick-
ets at a very reasonable £18.
Then,ofcourse,thereisthefamous
Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre
Season, running from now until the
11 September. Tickets start from
£10 and the programme includes
Twelfth Night and Cymbeline, as
well as Gilbert and Sullivan’s HMS
Pinafore, and Sunday night com-
edy including Harry Hill, Jimmy
Carr and the Comedy Store Players.
Greenwich Park is also hosting
Shakespeare this summer, with
Hamlet showing at the end of July,
and As You Like It at the beginning
of August.
Finally, there are several visual
arts shows running in Regent’s Park,
Battersea Park and Kensington
Gardens, and for those wishing to
really get their creative juices flow-
ing, there are drawing masterclass-
es in Greenwich Park with the artist
Frances Treanor.
On another note, the Royal Opera
House is putting up big screens in
Canada Square, Covent Garden,
Trafalgar Square and Victoria Park
showing the operas Rigoletto and
La Bohème, as well as a collection
of short ballet pieces called Stars of
the Royal Ballet.
