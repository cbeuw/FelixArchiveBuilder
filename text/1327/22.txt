CLUB REVIEW
Purple is a stylishly decorated venue
located in or around the Chelsea
Village complex. I say in or around,
since as a non-football fan I’m not
sure. It’s close by anyway, and as
such easy to find.
This really isn’t the kind of place
I go to very often. To me it’s not a
club, it’s a drinking house. Usually
I resent being charged entrance to
a place with an overcrowded bar,
overpriced drinks and uninspiring
music, but tonight I was with friends
so got dragged along. Actually it
isn’t as bad as all that.
Inside it does look pretty classy,
with a video screen, drapes and
floors on different levels. The place
boasts an ‘exclusive VIP area’ (read:
‘roped off part of the club’), as well
as podiums, a DJ box tucked right
out of the way, a fair amount of
seating and only one bar (that I
saw).
I’m told that at the weekends
you can’t get in, presumably unless
you’re a footballer or a wannabe foot-
baller’s wife/plaything. The crowd
tonight was pretty young, since it
was student (cheaper) night, and
generally pretty. A mate advised me
that most of the ladies were looking
to pull rich guys, but on that I really
couldn’t comment.
The solitary bar was really
rammed – about ten deep – and it
took quite a while to get served,
during which time I had to put up
with drunken dahlings squeezing,
rubbing and grinding against me.
It sounds much more pleasant than
it was. I have to give credit to the
bar staff – fair, efficient and friendly,
and on their advice I got four drinks
which sorted me out for the night
(only until about 1.30am). And four
vodka red bulls for a tenner isn’t
too bad.
Usually at these types of clubs, the
music depresses the hell out of me,
but tonight I really was pleasantly
surprised. It was mostly a mixture
of hip hop and R&B, including some
Jurassic 5, and there was nothing
I heard that’d I’d really call shit. I
have to give the DJ large amounts
of respect for dropping about half a
dozen tracks that I really like (and
actually sang along to), plus the fact
that he could mix and he did mash
it up a bit.
Given what this place is (and
my usual disinclination for such
establishments) I was genuinely
impressed. I’m surprising even
myself here by saying that I’d come
back to Purple – I reckon it’d be
a good place to go post-pub on a
Thursday, to warm up for a ‘real’
club later. Simon Clark
FESTIVAL REVIEW
Homelands, or in full, ‘We Love...
Homelands’, has been running for
over five years, and in that time has
built up a reputation for being one
of the best dance festivals and the
opener of the season.
The deal with dance festivals is
slightly different to the rest, being
held over one (very long) day and
through the night until the next
morning. That said, some promot-
ers do run weekenders at holiday
camps, and Godskitchen’s ‘Global
Gathering’ event at the end of July
is this year spreading the mayhem
across two days.
When I first saw the lineup for
Homelands 2005, with around 80
acts and DJs across ten separate
areas, I was literally drooling. It
was as if the organisers had been
watching me to find out all the DJs
I rate or have enjoyed over the past
couple of years so they could book
them all. I couldn’t have forgiven
myself for missing out on this, so
booked up my ticket nice and early
to avoid disappointment and provide
me with some light at the end of the
cold, dank tunnel that is final year
exams.
The event started at 12.30pm, with
live acts such as Babyshambles,
Audio Bullys and even the likes of
The Bravery and Beck there to pro-
vide early entertainment before the
onslaught into the night. We tried to
get the as early as we could, we real-
ly did, but events conspired against
us – engineering works on the trains,
and a bus replacement driven by a
proper chump who took us past the
site and on into Winchester.
From the road we had trek up
a hill and then past Operation
Cheesefoot. Operation Cheesefoot?
Allow me to elaborate. Hampshire
Constabulary were having a day out
as well, and they’d brought their
sniffer dogs with them. Before even
getting to the entrance to the arena,
we all had to file past this lot. There
were a lot of very nervous clubbers,
and rightly so – the police were pull-
ing so many people that there was
a queue of delinquents outside the
police tent, all waiting to be ‘exam-
ined’.
At events like this, drugs are
almost inevitable, but the police
clearly didn’t want to give that
impression. I read later that they
made about a dozen arrests, but
from what I heard from fellow revel-
lers most people got away with hav-
ing their stashes and tickets confis-
cated (though more were on sale)
and an informal caution.
The location, the Matterley Bowl
(a natural dip in the Hampshire
countryside), was perfect. All you
can see around you are hills and
trees, and I doubt any noise from
the site gets very far. By the time
we’d got inside, it was actually pret-
ty late. The sun was dipping, and I
just caught the gruff tones of Roots
Mavuna finishing his set in the live
arena with Witness.
Having got some cider down my
neck and done a bit of exploring,
it was time to assess the situation.
Sadly I’d already missed a few good
acts, but the night was still young.
We enjoyed some of Steve Lawler’s
chug-chug beats at the outdoor
stage, before heading into Arena 1
to catch Digweed. Playing a typical-
ly stalwart set, he picked us all up.
One strange thing to note about
the layout of the arena is that, since
it’s in a bowl, there’s a slope up
towards the stages. Whilst this
did keep the crowds from getting
packed, it made it a little difficult to
keep an even footing. After Digweed,
we hung around to check out Richie
Hawtin (aka Plastikman). His style
of minimal techno is tight, subtle
and deep. Next generation technolo-
gy give this man a very special edge.
One of my mates tried to drag me
elsewhere, but I was staying put.
By midnight, things were on a roll
and we spent the rest of the night
moving between the different are-
nas (some of which looked way too
similar, depsite being totally differ-
ent sizes), losing then finding each
other, and talking to other party
people.
By 5.30, when Danny Howells was
rounding up the event, we had all
over-exerted ourselves somewhat
and made a start on getting back.
The train was a sight to behold – all
the seats and passageways were full
of messed-up, danced-out ravers,
snuggling, sleeping and drooling on
one another. Bless.
Despite taking ages to get to, and a
fair bit more than the usual amount
of random shit occuring, Homelands
was most definitely a cracker.
Summer is here, and if Homelands
was anything to go by, it’s going to
be great. Simon Clark

Homelands: festival season arrives
Homelands is just about the first festival of the summer. Given that they’d booked just
about every DJ in the world, it would have been rude not to go...

Farewell
The End is my favourite club. That’s
only really relevant here because
we’ve come to the end. This is the
last Nightlife of the year, and my last
as editor of this page.
Whilst I’m not really sure how
many of you read this stuff (the
poor fools, they really don’t know
what they’re missing), I hope you’ve
enjoyed reading as much as I’ve
enjoyed writing. It’s really been
quite a giggle partying down in the
name of good journalism – hopefully
I’ve helped you plan your nights
out, entertained you a little, or at
the very least helped you under-
stand why so many of us (if not that
many Imperial kids) like to spend
our weekends bouncing around dark
rooms listening to strange, repeti-
tive electronic music.
I started the year with a festival
– the sundrenched South West Four
on Clapham Common – and I’m
ending it with one. Homelands was
wicked, even if there’s some stuff
I haven’t printed (I’ll tell you when
you’re old enough).
The passing of Homelands means
it’s festival time again. Woo! As
usual, there’s tons going on over
the summer. If I could make it I’d
be well up for Godskitchen’s Global
Gathering – they’re doing it over two
nights this year. If you’re anything
like me, you’ll be thinking “God,
that’s going to be messy...”
I’d like to take this opportunity
to thank the few reviewers who’ve
made my life easier and made these
pages less of a personal journal by
going out and telling us about it. I
also want to give a shout out to my
mate Hasan, who’s been my club-
bing buddy since first year, without
whom I wouldn’t have been to half
the places I have, and I wouldn’t
have got so trashed. And we couldn’t
have that, now could we?
Aside from that, I don’t really have
much to say. At the time of writing
there is no Nightlife editor for next
year, so if you fancy filling some
pages with whatever happens to be
floating through your head at the
time... I mean, if you want to become
a serious and respected journalist,
drop us a line at felix@ic.ac.uk and
you could be sitting here writing this
next year. It’s well worth it – having
media power means that virtually
every club in the capital will gladly
put you on their VIP list so you can
splurge about them. Also, with the
power comes fame, fortune and fine
women falling at your feet*.
So that’s it. Piss off now, leave me
alone. Enjoy your summer. Work like
you don’t need the money. Love like
you’ve never been hurt. Dance like
no-one’s watching. See you in front
of the speakers. Simon Clark
(soon to be former) Nightlife Editor
* None of these things are true.
Especially the women, this is
Imperial dammit.
We need a NIGHTLIFE EDITOR and CLUB REVIEWERS for next year! Interested? Email felix@ic.ac.uk
