Hello, solvers one and all. I’m
afraid after two weeks of solid
essay-writing I have few words
left in me. The amateur psychol-
ogists amongst you might like to
muse on the answers to 11, 23,
and 28 across, and 1, 6, 7, 9, 17,
19, 21, and 24 down; I can only try
to assure you of their innocence.
Now I must get back to revision.
Good luck! Snufkin
