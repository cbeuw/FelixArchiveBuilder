Union reveals plans
to transform Beit
By Dave Edwards
Editor
Imperial College Union’s
main building in Beit Quad
is set to undergo large-scale
refurbishment from early
2006. The Union’s facilities
will be severely disrupted for
at least six months and the
project will cost several mil-
lion pounds, but the process
should bring huge benefits
for students in future years.
In last term’s online survey,
68% of students were in favour
of improving or refurbish-
ing Beit. The Union Council
this week agreed to support
a proposal to take forward
planning work on the project,
which could revolutionise the
Union building and its facili-
ties. However, some delegates
suggested that changes in the
management of current facili-
ties could be more effective
than a complete overhaul.
The plans have not been
finalised – a working group
will review them over the
summer, student feedback
will be sought in the autumn
term and the Council is due
to sign off final proposals in
December.
Some likely changes
include revitalising the tired-
looking main entrance and
stairwell, increasing use of
the north entrance next to
the Royal Albert Hall, moving
the Student Activities Centre
to the main building, putting
in large doors so that the two
main bars open onto the Quad,
refurbishing the Union Bar,
and building a new lounge
bar on the first floor. Union
officers are considering these
and many other alterations
as part of a flexible plan from
their appointed architects.
Sameena Misbahuddin, the
Union’s Deputy President
(Finance and Services), told
Felix: “Students deserve a
much better Union building.
The refurbishment will give
better facilities for student
activities and better social
facilities. Students will be
proud of the new Union
building.”
The entire redevelopment
project could cost anything
between £3m and £10m,
depending on which options
are chosen. Funding could
come from the College’s
catering and conferences
review, which has recom-
mended investing £7m to
£8m into bar and catering
facilities across the South
Kensington campus. In the
past, the College has allowed
the Union to borrow funds for
major projects on an inter-
est free basis. Also, the new
building should have great-
er commercial potential,
allowing some of the cost to
be repaid over time.
Some aspects of the pro-
posals could be controver-
sial. The architects’ plans
for rebranding the Union are
unlikely to be well received by
Imperial’s conservative stu-
dent body. Meanwhile, dur-
ing the refurbishment, there
could be no sports facilities or
drinking areas at all.
However, the project could
create a modern building
focused on students’ needs,
moving Imperial’s recrea-
tional facilities in line with
the College’s reputation as
one of the world’s premier
universities.
Further details on the rede-
velopment plans are available
at www.union.ic.ac.uk.

“Students deserve

building...”
By Dave Edwards
Felix has learnt that College
officials have found a poten-
tial location for a replacement
for Southside Bar.
The popular bar will close
its doors for the final time on
24 June, shortly before the
Southside building is demol-
ished. Over 3000 people have
signed a petition calling for a
replacementforthebar,which
recently won the Campaign
for Real Ale ‘Club of the Year’
runner-up award.
The ‘Save Our Southside’
campaign group has been
searching for suitable loca-
tions on the South Kensington
campus, and it appears that
one may now have been
found.
We cannot reveal the pre-
cise location at this stage, but
Mustafa Arif, President of
Imperial College Union, said
he was “70 to 80% confident”
that it would be transformed
into a new College bar in
the near future. Discussions
between students’ groups
and the College are ongo-
ing. Further details will
appear on the Felix website,
www.felixonline.co.uk, in due
course.
