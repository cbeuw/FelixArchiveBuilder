Shell comes clean
For the first time in it’s his-
tory as a PLC, Royal Dutch/
Shell Group has published
it’s internal guidelines for
estimating reserves of oil and
natural gas.
The guidelines were tight-
ened last year after the com-
pany disclosed that it had
significantly overestimated
its oil reserves. The revised
rules now meet US regula-
tory guidelines and help put
behind it an accounting scan-
dal that unfolded in early
2004.
The Anglo-Dutch oil com-
pany cut its estimate of
reserves by more than a third
since last January and has
faced criticism of its account-
ing practices, such as booking
reserves on projects before
investment plans had been
approved.
Under its new rules, Shell
said that for a major field of
50m barrels of oil equivalent
or more, the final investment
approval must be received
before a project is booked
in its reserves. However, for
smaller oil fields, Shell must
also have evidence that sim-
ilar projects have come to
fruition as this would prevent
unnecessary environmental
damage.
It said all proven reserves
must be monitored at every
year end, to make sure
prior bookings are still valid.
Documentation of changes at
the reservoir level must be
carried out each year.
The disclosure comes after
a $150m settlement with both
the SEC and the FSA, the
financial regulatory bodies in
the US and UK respectively,
in July, following a string of
restatements after the com-
pany allegedly boosted its
numbers artificially. The pay-
ments didn’t imply a recogni-
tion of guilt, but the company
is still the target of related
class-action lawsuits in the
US.
In case one wonders why
such guidelines are so impor-
tant, they can have a major
impact on the share price of
stocks, especially when esti-
mates, profits and revenues
are revealed to the world by
a PLC like Shell.
Spitzer subdued
New York Attorney General
Eliot Spitzer last week had
his lawsuit defeated as
jurors acquitted the Bank of
America’s broker, Theodore
C Sihpol III, of ‘late trading’.
Late trading involves the
exchange of mutual fund
shares after the close of
trade (4pm). Trades posted
after that time are supposed
to receive a price set the fol-
lowing day. But, in a battle
of wits, Sihpol was acquit-
ted as late trading was never
considered improper before
he was being prosecuted and
arrested in September 2004.
C Evan Stewart, Sihpol’s
lawyer, praised him for aban-
doning the traditional settle-
ment with Spitzer and going
to court to contest his allega-
tion. In this case, it paid off.
Sihpol’s success is a fairly
significant achievement, as
it will encourage other firms
that have pending lawsuits
filed by Spitzer, whose relent-
less pursuit of firms operat-
ing outside the law has seen
their shares drop by over
50%.
Richard Grasso, the former
head of the New York Stock
Exchange, has also chosen
to prepare a defence for trial
instead of reaching settle-
ments with the New York’s
Attorney General. Mr Spitzer
last year filed a lawsuit
against Mr Grasso, arguing
that his compensation pack-
age represented excessive
remuneration for the head of
a not-for-profit organisation.
His case has not yet been
scheduled.
Three other executives in
the mutual fund industry are
scheduled to defend charg-
es of permitting improper
mutual fund trading before
the New York Supreme Court
judge who heard Mr Sihpol’s
case.
Final words
In this past year, we’ve tried
to bring you news that is rel-
evant and interesting to the
business-minded students
of Imperial College. We’ve
tried to present a fair, true
and rounded picture of the
state of some of the world’s
baddest governments, mam-
moth power-hungry corpora-
tions and ugliest billionaires.
Unfortunately for you, you’re
in a country run by one of
those governments, you’ll
probably join one of the mam-
moth corporations and, like
certain Imperial graduates,
you might just end up as one
of the ugly billionaires!
