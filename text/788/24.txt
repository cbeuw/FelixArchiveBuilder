IC EAST KARAKORAM EXPEDITION
Moonlight on the Mountains
Back in late July,
with Jeffrey
Archer's reputation
still in the balance,
a rumour that the
Soviets might
actually back a
zero-zero arms
reduction option
being bandied about
and the US escort
of reflagged
supertankers just
getting underway,
we flew over the
Straits of Hormuz
on our way from
London to
Karachi—where a
bombing a few
days earlier had
killed 50 and
injured 200.
From Karachi we flew north to
Pakistan's capital, Islamabad (a
showpiece city, still being built).
There we dealt with various bits of
red tape and continued our application
for permission to carry out a Civil
Engineering Research Project, with
the British Embassy exerting
influence on our behalf. The
expedition was conceived asi a
combined mountaineering effort and
'road project'. Our road project
would have looked at the Indus
Highway; a route hewn from the side
of the Indus Gorge. Due to the
geological youth of the whole area
(essentially the Karakoram is at the
westward end of the Himalayas) the
road is prone to frequent landslides,
blocking and damaging it. We wanted
to study and survey some of the
affected areas and bring to bear up-
to-date slope failure anaysis
techniques. They have not been used
in such a context before and as well
as trying to suggest practical remedial
measures, we hoped to break new
ground scientifically. However, after
receiving permission to go ahead
from their Ministry of Defence, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs politely
refused it. And that was that!
The result was a swift modification
of our plans and saw all ten expedition
members at the mountaineering base
camp together (possibly the first time
we'd all been together since the
expedition was conceived). To get
there we spent sixteen hours on a bus
travelling up the famous Karakoram
Highway to Gilgit and a further eight
hours on the Indus Highway ('our
road') over to Skardu.
Then we followed in the footsteps
of the big expeditions on their way up
to K2 (the worlds second highest
mountain) and the other big
mountains up there. The relative ease
of access and having a large fraction
of the world's highest and hardest
mountains makes the area a magnet
for the likes of Chris Bonnington.
Indeed some of us met Doug Scott on
his way back from K2—about to go
to Everest!
see if we wanted to go home we saw
no sign of humanity or its works
except satellites in the ever clear,
magnificent night sky— and what we
had brought with us.

We took an incredibly hairy forty-
mile jeep ride (perched on our heaps
of food and gear, hanging on tightly
as the jeep negotiated the mountain
passes, landslides and rivers) to the
village of Dassu. There we hired
porters and set off for the three day
journey up into the mountain (turning
left off the K2 route after a day).
Most of us spent the next seven
weeks up there, eating rice and
chapattis every day, sunbathing and
mountaineering. Apart from the

they decided they'd had enough,
returned to Skardu, and after showing
little improvement headed home.
The rest of us notched up four first
ascents, one or two new routes and
several other climbs. We also mapped
the area, roughly speaking a bowl of
six-mile radius, ringed with high
mountains, criss-crossed with several
ridges and glaciers—almost a self-
contained, private universe. Climbing
to its edges and looking over the other
side was quite an experience. We saw
K 2 , the Ogre (a mountain on which
Doug Scott and Chris Bonnington
nearly died—Scott descending on
hands and knees with two broken
legs), the Biafo Glacier, Nanga Parbat
and several other famous mountains.
The high point of the expedition
was the conquering of two unclimbed
peaks which we named Ice Horn
(5000m) and White Peak (5500m).
These were climbed on a three day
attempt, including one night spent
sleeping on a glacier at - 2 0 ° C (the
failure of the stove didn't help), in
which the basic approach was to
climb up a iong snow-ice gully onto
