JUDO
Making the grade
The IC Judo Club organised and held
its first grading competition for low
grades on Saturday December 5. In
total, 7 women and 16 men from IC
and other London colleges competed.
Everyone had at least three fights, and
we were fortunate in that only one
player sustained a minor wrist injury.
A l l those from IC fought well, and
were graded accordingly. O f the
novices, Juliet White, Jon Bird, Craig
Holmes and Steve Delaney were
promoted to 8th K y u (lower orange)
while Brian Sentance and Stuart
Wheaton were awarded 7th K y u
(upper orrange). O f the graded
players, Mylan Lester was promoted
from 8th to 7th K y u , and Henry
Young from 7th to 6th K y u .
Unfortunately, Yoke-Foong Tan,
who had fought well for London
University the week before in
Leicester, was unable to compete due
to a shoulder injury she had picked
up earlier in the week in training.
After the grading, the examiner
commented on the high standard that
the novices had reached after only 8
weeks of Judo—they had all been
promoted from white to orange
jumping over yellow belt. This is a
credit to both their dedicated
enthusiasm and the excellent coaching
of Paul Warren (3rd Dan) and Peter
Swettenham (lst Dan).
T E N - P I N BOWLING
Demolished
IC 8 - K e n t 2
Last Wednesday IC stretched their
long unbeaten run with a convincing
victory over Kent University.
Right from the start, our bowlers
justified their fearsome reputation
within the U C T B A . Skipper Paul
Gaines, leading by example, opened
up with a magnificent 203, inspiring
his teammates Garman W o n g
(showing no reaction to last week's
broken leg) and Roger Allen to
memorable performances.
The B team, led as usual by Steve
Russell and including C h i Chan and
the new rising star Paul Young
(scorer of the second 200 of the day)
crushed the Kent B team. The IC C
squad comprising the legendary
Martin 'Moggy' Morris, Scott Waye,
Ben Surtees and Simon Phillips
continued the demolition by
destroying their opponents with a
clinical display of text book bowling.
The two points that did fall Kent's
way were due to IC having an
understrength ladies team (what a
surprise!). In fact Christine L i ,
Andrina Wiles and Katie Rhodes
(slightly jaded from the previous
night's activities) battled gallantly
only to lose by the narrowest margin
to their Canterbury counterparts.
If you think you can take more
drama than Dynasty, more excitement
than Eastenders and more notoriety
than Neighbours, then come bowling
with IC—meet opposite Beit Arch
(outside Aero Eng) on Wednesday at
2.20pm.
HOCKEY
Referee—11
IC lsts—4
Essex University lsts—1
Having only finished second in their
U A U group, IC lsts had to play a
qualifying game in order to enter the
last 16 of the competition. Imperial
received a dream start inside 20
seconds with a goal made and scored
down the left by Hari Vamadevan.
Bouncing back straight away Essex
forced a short comer which, if it were
not for the reactions of the goalie Cole
Slatter, would certainly have found
the net. When placed under
occasional pressure Imperial all too
often resorted to stick tackles. These
resulted in a spate of short corners,
one of which rewarded Essex with
their equalising penalty flick goal. By
half time all 11 of the IC side had
received a warning green card, with
Gary Knaresborough having been
sent off.
In the second half, Brendan Farmer
came on at left half for John Rose.
However Imperial continued to play
with great spirit and some skill. Soon,
with yet another wobble into the ' D ' ,
the inspirational Vamadevan won a
penalty flick. Jim Garside left the
trendy Essex goalie with no chance.
From then on IC, supported by an
enthusiastic crowd, swamped Essex
with superb hockey resulting in two
scorching goals. Paul Skipworth
scored I C ' s corner, and Gary
Knaresborough rounded things off
with an undercut shot into the same
spot. This result earns the lsts an
enviable trip away to Bristol.
KARATE
Don't medal with them
On Sunday December 16 the British
Students' Karate Championships were
held at Crystal Palace. Imperial
College together with some other
U L U clubs submitted a 'London
University' team, many of whose
members were from I C . The
competition was fierce with 27 teams
represented and upwards of 300
competitors, however we succeeded
in coming away with a hand 'full'
with 24 medals and one trophy. We
were also runners up for the
Keinosuke Enocda trophy awarded to
the team with the best aggregate
performance, with a particularly
strong Cambridge team just beating
us.
Credible performances were given
all round with the ladies excelling
themselves and winning a total of 12
medals amongst the three of them!
Meiken Engelstad took 2 gold medals
for individual kumite (sparring)—the
B U S F (British Universities Sports
Federation) and the BSSF (British
Students Sports Federation) medals,
with Sara Lindberg taking both
bronze medals. Kate Taylor won the
FENCING
Foiling the opposition
BSSF and B U S F silver medals for the
individual kata (fixed forms) when
she came second; and together the 3
ladies came first in the team kumite
removing all resistance with their
strong and aggressive style taking the
B U S F and BSSF gold medals as well
as a huge trophy awarded for the
'pursuit of excellence' in the ladies'
team kumite.
The men, though not faring quite
as well, competed with good spirit
and some excellent results were
achieved. Not only was the whole
team second best on aggregate but the
men's team kata gained the BSSF and
B U S F bronze medals, only narrowly
missing silver and Paul Potter,
Kenrick Sayers, Paul Urbona, Osama
Kawafi and Bob-Alonge all but
proved unstoppable, winning bronze
medals for the team kumite when they
were eventually defeated by the
eventual winners.
Many thanks to those who took part
for trying so hard and doing so well
and thanks to Caesar Andrews for
coaching and guiding us to eventual
victory.
On Saturday November 28, IC hosted
the first round of the U A U Fencing
Championship for both South East
South Division and the South East
North Division in the Great Hall. The
whole day was a great success
especially for our teams. Many thanks
to everyone who helped the day go
smoothly, especially Simon Heaps for
all his help and Peter Cripwell for
presiding over the sabre competition.
In the South East North Divison
only U C L and City University were
competing. U C L have a very strong
team this year. They beat City 7-2 in
the sabre; 8-1 in the foil and 6-3 in
the epee. This gave them an overall
victory of 21-6. U C L did not bring
a ladies team and therefore the City
ladies' foil team went through by
default.
Meanwhile the South East South
Division kicked off with the Sabre
competition and our star sabreur,
Simon Holden, managed to lose his
first fight a very close 1-5! However,
after this somewhat worrying start
they then went on to beat Surrey 5-4!
Next came the men's foil with Peter
Cripwell and Ron Tham in very good
form each winning all three of their
fights leading to a 7-2 victory.
The last weapon in the men's
competition Was the epee. By this
time they only needed two more fights
to win. To add to the excitement Peter
and Adam (who was not hungover
this time) bet vast amounts of alcohol
on their performance. Needless to say
this spurred the epee team into a
resounding 8-1 victory with our
illustrious captain, Simon, the only
one to lose a fight and Peter four pints
down on the match. The overall result
then was a 20-7 victory over Surrey
University, putting us through first to
the next round with Surrey runners
up.
The highlight of the day was the
ladies' foil which we won 5-4 despite
Caroline's injured knee and Sophia's
lack of experience. Well fenced
Sophia! We then had a friendly match
against City ladies. After seeing both
Caroline and Sophia lose against two
very aggressive City Ladies, Clare
stepped onto the piste with some
. trepidation. She lost this first fight 5-4
and then redeemed herself by winning
the other two. Overall City beat IC
, 5-4 in a very close match.
FELIX Wednesday 16th December 1987 35
