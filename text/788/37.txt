Scum
Dear Judith,
I had not realised until last week that F E L I X could be
used as a vehicle for vindictiveness and insults;
congratulations to Matthew Soane the P A T A Chairman
for grasping this fact. If he wishes to ridicule me I have
no objections at all, but, I deeply resent his deliberate
implication that I support infanticide. If this is typical of
the way P A T A responds to opposing views, is it any
wonder that they have received so much adverse feeling
towards their 'stand'. Next time M r Soane, confine your
comments to the written content when critisizing—only
the lowest scum of the Earth sinks to the level that you
did last week, surely you're not always like that?
Yours hopefully (and with some reservation
about politeness),
Steven Mercer (Physics 3).
IC discipline
is a farce
Dear Judith,
I write with reference to a meeting of the College
Disciplinary Committee (12.12.87) in which the matter
of discussion revolved around an incident report in F E L I X
concerning the assault on Union Bar Manager, Adrian
Johnson in which he was attacked with a glass.
The committee in question imposed a fine on M r
Marchant of £25, the Royal School of Mines also imposed
a fine on him of £15.
I would just like to say that for the seriousness of the
offence, a £40 fine is appalling. Working behind the bar
knowing someone can hit you, glass you, whatever and
receive such a small fine is worrying.
Yours sincerely,
A member of bar staff (name and address supplied).
Conman-a
misapprehension
Dear Judith,
I would just like to take this opportunity to use this small
amount of space available to correct a widely held
misapprehension among Imperial College students and
staff.
It has come to my attention, during months of extensive
research costing thousands of pounds and using the latest
in hi-tech equipment that some things are not quite as they
seem. More research has revealed that what I have
discovered is not a new phenomena, but is unearthed about
this time of year by a radical non-conformist.
Unfortunately, there is a mass campaign, led from very,
very high up in the government, the military, industry,
commerce and academia to suppress this information. I
think that this is unacceptable in a democratic society and
I hope that Judith will ignore the injunctions and go ahead
and publish these allegations.
And now the time has come to reveal the truth: Santa
Claus does not exist!
He was created by advertising agencies in an attempt
to con little kids into asking their parents for excessive
amounts of presents, and is being sustained by this wicked
government for the benefit of its friends in the City.
I hope this revelation will not spoil Christmas for your
readers, disappointing as it must be.
Wishing all your readers a very merry Christmas and
a happy New Year.
Yours seasonally,
Adrian M Bourne.
No ill-feeling
Dear Judith,
Last week's issue of F E L I X (No 787) contained a letter
from Emma Barrett, the outgoing Rag Secretary, which
raised a few points that have to be clarified.
Firstly, Emma has resigned as Rag Secretary because
she is dissatisfied with her course and is in the process
of leaving College. She has not resigned over the 'Drink
a Pub D r y ' incident at U L U .
This brings me onto the choice of venue. Many
complaints have been received in the past about the price
of beer in the pub chosen for the event. U L U was chosen
on the grounds that the beer was reasonably cheap and
any profits made would benefit students. The person
Emma quoted in her letter was myself, but unfortunately
it was out of context. When I was asked by Emma at the
beginning of a Rag Meeting why we went to U L U , I,
knowing that Emma is a member of C N D and the Labour
Party, replied 'they are a bunch of lefties and we hate
them.' At the time most people, including Emma, found
it amusing. I'm disappointed that she reported it as a
serious reason for choosing U L U . The same applies to
my comment about Ian.
As to the matter of being offered 50% off the profits
from a local pub well, I'm afraid Emma got her facts very
wrong! The interested 'local pub' was a snooker club in
Holborn. We were offered 10% of their profits on the
condition we had at least 250 people. The 10% of the
profits to Rag interested me until I found out that bitter
was £1.30 per pint. I hope now that people will realise
why I decided to go to U L U afterall.
The ill-feeling between IC and U L U has now been sorted
out. I spoke to U L U President John Tilsead, and Vice
President (Services) Norm Robinson, on Monday and they
informed me that they also felt that 'London Student' had
exaggerated the incident. They also said that no action
was to be taken as I returned most of the signs last Friday.
I hope this has cleared up any misunderstanding about the
event.
It has been decided that the Rag Exec (the Rag Officers
and the C C U VPs) will look into all the events in Rag
Week and consider their viability for next year. I for one
will be very surprised if 'Drink a Pub D r y ' and for that
matter 'Morphy Day', appear on next year's timetable.
Yours sincerely,
Nigel D Baker, IC Rag Chairman.
