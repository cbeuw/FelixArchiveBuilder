Bestseller
Best Seller stars James Woods and
Brian Dennehy two of the most
interesting and poweful lesser-known
Hollywood actors who, here, have
been given roles that couldn't be
better designed for them (whether the
script was written with them in mind
I know not). The story too is based
around an interesting and clever idea
and starts well.
Dennehy plays Dennis Meechum,
a policeman and writer, basing his
first best seller on an incident during
the seventies when, during a robbery
on a police evidence storeroom, three
of his friends are killed and he is
wounded. Years later, after the death
of his wife, he has difficulty writing
and runs into financial trouble. At this
point the menacing character of Cleve
(Woods) appears. He is a professional
assassin who was involved in the
earlier robbery and who now, after
being cast aside by his employer Paul
Shenar, an extremely powerful
businessman, seeks revenge by
offering to expose his own and
Shenar's activities.
Together they set off across
America to collect the evidence that
will be needed to write the 'best
seller' that will uncover Shenar. This
part of the film is interesting, as the
relationship between the two men
develops from antagonism and
mistrust to an uneasy friendship. It
becomes clear, as Cleve describes in
detail and even shows off about how
cleverly he has achieved, the ghastly
killings of his many victims, that he
is a psychopath, and that his motives
for helping Meechum write the book
are more inscrutable than they at first
seemed. Does he want it to be a
confession, an expurgation of his
conscience or, more likely, as Cleve
struggles to make sure he is seen in
a comparatively good light, an epitath
that paints him as some sort of hero.
Meechum's motives too are unclear,
his main aim is to bring down Shenar,
but does he want to get Cleve too? He
certainly intends revenge for Cleve's
involvement in the 70s killings, and
a confrontation seems inevitable.
Unfortunately, from here the film
develops none of these possibilities,
Cleve and Meechum unite to face the
common enemy of Shenar and his
organisation, and the film wends its
extremely violent latter stages to a
bloodbath ending that provides no
insights into any of the subtleties
mentioned, and cops out of the
confrontation between the two lead
characters.
The Dead
Dublin, 1904.
On a new year's evening, two
eldery sisters—Miss Kate and Miss
Julia Morkan—welcome their guests
to their annual dance. Amongst the
guests are Gabriel Conroy and his
wife Gretta.
The dance proceeds smoothly—a
well-known drunk manages to avoid
disgracing himself, for a change.
Gabriel, who gives a speech about
absent friends, is suddenly struck by
his wife's pose on the staircase, as she
listens to another guest singing the
old, mournful ballad 'The Lass of
Aughrim'.
Later that evening, Gretta confesses
to her husband that the ballad
reminded her of an innocent love
from her girlhood. The boy, who was
ailing, came through snow to bid her
farewell when she left the village, and
subsequently he died—perhaps, she
imagines, for love of her.
Gabriel, moved by her tears, and
perhaps a shade jealous, feels a great
emptiness inside him. He knows that
he has never known love like that.
Putting aside the notoriety that The
Dead will undoubtedly gain, being
John Huston's last film, it is
nevertheless a virtually flawless
adaption of James Joyce's marvellous
short story. There are one or two
minor quibbles—Joyce's text would
be better presented in the form of a
voice over narration. In the story, the
moment where Gretta pauses on the
stairs is one of graceful mystery;
Gabriel isn't even sure who the
woman is. In the film, due to lack of
any direct communication between
Gabriel and the audience, the moment
must be more deliberately staged for
him, and thus it loses its mystery, and
becomes more of a pregnant moment.
The adaptation by Huston's son,
Tony, is excellent. The script
manages to capture all the exquisite
and unmistakably Joycean
elaborations and expansions that have
made the writer so famous and,
intriguing. The final scenes, where
Gabriel looks out of the hotel window
at the wintry landscape, after hearing
his wife's confession, exactly mirror
Joyce's text:
'Think of all those back in
time...this solid world
dwindling...snow falling on that
lovely graveyard... upon all the living
and the dead.'
Ironically, the desolation and yet
reconciliation in these words seems
to mirror Huston's regretful
acceptance of his own death.
The film is almost entirely plotless,
the drama reduced to small moments.
The Dead is more like an orchestral
work—the chorus conjures up one
image; the inevitability of death, and
the dreadful sense of waste which we
all feel upon its eternal hovering
above us. Readers of English poet
Phillip Larkin should have no trouble
in comprehending these ideas.
The Dead is impeccably made and
directed, a typical change of direction
by Huston after the relative
commercialism of. Prizzi's Honour.
It's a masterpiece, in which Huston
himself will live. It's by no means
mainstream cinema, but should be
seen, even if it's the first and last time
you go to see such a film.

I found this disappointing to say the
least, since Woods and Dennehy, who
both perform well, are given some
witty and sharp dialogue and deserve
better in the way of a plot. However,
as is sadly too common in Hollywood
these days, the script has relented to
the pressures of commercialism and
has chosen the easy route of
entertaining with 'glam' violence.

I haven't actually seen this yet, but
it's Mel Brooks writing, directing and
acting, so it must be good!

Bigfoot and the Hendersons
The Henderson Family, on holiday in
the mountains, literally run into the
legendary Bigfoot, and decide to take
him home, with hilarious results.
Need I say more? Perhaps a trifle
overlong, but good for an afternoon
when you feel like being a kid. This
film is the first to come out for a long
time that is anti-gun and and-violence.
