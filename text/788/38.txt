e t t e r s JO:
Cost ofCERN
Dear Ms Hackney,
Could I, as a particle physicist, comment on some of
Steve Black's points on British membership of C E R N in
last week's F E L I X ? It is true that S E R C is desperately
short of money and that the C E R N subscription is a major
item on its budget. The cost of C E R N is shared between
the 14 member countries in proportion to their GDP's but
payment is in Swiss francs and changes in currencies can
play havoc with budgets which the Government insist must
be cash-limited in pounds. As far as I know Britain is
unique in paying such subscriptions directly from its
science budget but I don't think that the Foreign Office,
which itself often faces similar problems, is a better
alternative.
I see particle physics very much as a part of science •
and to my mind it should be judged ultimately from this
standpoint. We all find ourselves on this strange planet,
for a brief time and surrounded by a fascinating
universe—fascinating on the big scale and the small;
fascinating in its complexities and its simplicities. Of
course we don't need to think about such things though
probably everyone does on occasion and certainly it is one
of the driving ideas for a place such as Imperial.
In justification of research such as at C E R N let me
therefore first refer to the science. One asks what are things
made of and where do forces come from? A s one probes
with this question and does experiments, down past atoms
and nuclei a strange world of mesons, baryons and leptons
appears, a world in which matter and anitmatter have equal
footing, a world in which the familiar electrons and protons
are seen as merely the lightest, and therefore stable
particles of their kind. One goes further and there is a
major advance (the Electroweak theory of Salam and
Weinberg) and suddenly a great unifying pattern is seen
in which things as disparate as electricity, beta decay and
gravity appear similar and questions such as 'why is the
hydrogen atom neutral?' and 'why do particles have mass?'
take on a new, profound significance. A l l such ideas have
to work hand in hand with experiments and the history
of the subject has been one of interplay between theory
and experiment; as you can well imagine given a theory
such as the Electroweak, experimenters are driven to do
whatever they can to test and try it out, even to the extent
of pooling their resources on an international and
sometimes world-wide scale.
Looking back over the last twenty years or so let me
mention briefly some of the areas in which particle physics
has directly impacted on other branches of science and
technology. There is the whole area of accelerator
technology, eg the use of synchrotron radiation from
electron storage rings for a host of studies on atomic and
molecular structures. There has always been an intense
concern with particle detectors, from the days of geiger
counters and electron-sensitive emulsions to such as P E T
(Positron Emission Tomography) currently being applied
to problems in chemical engineering and brain metabolism.
One can think of the drive to faster electronic processing,
pattern recognition and scientific computers. There is
much interaction between the theory and Mathematics,
eg Group theory, non-linear phenomena and phase
transformations. There are whole new insights into
cosmology. In all these areas particle physics has
encouraged, and sometimes initiated growth.
The British Government (as there is an International
Treaty it is ultimately a Government, not S E R C decision)
may decide to withdraw from C E R N , the essential
argument being, as Steve Black implies, that the country
cannot afford it. This to me is a measure of the parlous
state to which support for basic science as across the
disciplines has fallen in the U K and the low esteem in
which it is at present held. Can we really argue that, in
order to support obviously important areas of chemistry
or molecular biology or for example research into high
temperature superconductors the country .has to give up
research into particle physics (or whatever would be next
in line)? Ultimately this is what it is about. It is astonishing
to me also that our great chemical industry—as typified
by ICI, our great electronics industry (eg GEC), and our
great petroleum and mining industries (possibly including
BP), still do so little to foster science and scientists in our
universities in the areas Steve mentions. Science just now
is 'piggy in the middle' between Government and industry
and we all need to do what we can to convince both of
them that it is not just the City of London that needs to
take a longer-term view. I think, and hope, that this may
be starting to happen.
Yours sincerely,
David Binnie.
SDI ethics
Dear Steve,
Thank you for an outspoken editorial on science and
values (FELIX Nov 27)—even more so in the light of some
people's argument 'that there is no place for such opinions
in a page about science.'
However, if science is ever to become a science for
people (not for industry—we've been treated to this variant
for a whole year) then a few more scientists like Woodruff
(or indeed those 50 U K scientists who signed a pledge
refusing to participate in Star Wars condemning SDI as
technically dubious) will not do.
What is called for is not more truthfulness—this is where
professional ethics start, not end—but radical rethinking
of scientific positivism. Far from being neutral, technology
involves major value judgements by choosing to adopt a
technological worldview and the SDI controversy is highly
illuminating in this regard.
Any criticism of SDI centering around technical
infeasibility testifies to a thinking arrested in 'neutral
technology' categories. SDI is about substituting
technological for political rationality and it is this decision
and all its implications that need to be challenged by
concerned scientists.
Yours sincerely,
Jobst Treiber (Elec Eng PG).
Silly letter
Dear Judith,
A copy of your publication, if swallowed by a small
child, could easily lead to choking. Do you not think that
it is irresponsible to leave copies lying around on low
tables where children, of which there are a large number
in this country, could easily reach them?
Yours sincerely,
Buster Gonad.
