CRICKET
TOUR
CRISIS
FRED FOULMOUTH Don
the satisfaction of coming
DON'T condemn
Mike Fatman
for reacting as
he did when um-
pire Kashmir
Jumper put his
spoke in about
changing the field
during IC Cricket
Vs match at Surrey
Polytechnic.
I think I'd have
blown my top.
But we shouldn't
abort the Christmas
Tour, furious as the
V s must be. It just
wouldn't be cricket.
N o r should we
refuse to play Sur-
rey Poly again. It
would give the i m -
pression that w e ' d
been driven away,
seen off. A n d sure-
ly, we're bigger
than that.
A n y w a y , I
wouldn't give Sur-
rey the satisfaction.
I m p e r i a l ' s
cricketers should
take a deep breath,
try to keep their
tempers and see out
the most controver-
sial cricket tour
there has ever been.
Kashmir Jumper
was out of order. H e
should concentrate
first on getting his
job right.
Imperial is the top
cricket university
with the only full-
time u m p i r i n g
structure.
It's time the rest
followed suit.
A n d , putting it
baldly: W h y should
some Poly where
they don't seem to
care about umpiring
standards have the
benefit o f o u r
people—while we're
having to put up
with theirs?
Surrey has always
been dodgy for um-
piring. A n d things
are done so
transparently.
Let's shoot the lot
of 'em.
• Iain Sluicegate
last night let rip
with an attack on
ICs captain Mike
Fatman's
behaviour.
• The former
Geology tea maker
and current union
supremo reckons
that whatever the
provocation Fat-
man should not
have vented his
fury on umpire
Kashmir Jumper.
• "Things have
not changed at
Surrey Poly since I
made tea there in
1962," said
Sluicegate.
• "The food is
bad, the umpiring
is bad and there
have been some
terrible umpiring
decisions."
• Toilet cleaner
Edna Andrex join-
ed the criticism of
Fatman by saying:
"He never flushes
the loo after he's
i used it either."
FATMAN
FURY
From PAUL WEAVER
IM P E R I A L ' S
strife-torn
C h r i s t m a s
cricket tour could
be abandoned after
yesterday's furious
row between cap-
tain Mike Fatman
and Surrey
Polytechnic's um-
pire Kashmir
Jumper.
Three days o f
frustration and
resentment exploded
in the last over of
the day when Fat-
man and Jumper
were involved in a
toe-to-toe slanging
match at Surrey's
home g r o u n d .
Jumper claimed:
"Fatman called me
a shit umpire and a
son of a bitch. So I
told him that he
shouldn't have eaten
so many christmas
puddings o n the
tour."
