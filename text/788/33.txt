Parliament
On Friday November 27, 18 lucky
members of College were able to visit
the Houses of Parliament on a trip
organised by the Conservative-
Society. After passing through the
security checks, we were greeted by
the Conservative Party Chairman, M r
Peter Brooke, who took us into the
Visitor's Gallery of the House of
Commons where we listened to a
debate between M r s Edwina Currie
and Dennis Skinner on the N H S .
After the debate, M r Brooke took us
on a short tour of the Chamber itself,
explained how the Members voted in
'Divisions' and showed us the St
Stephen's Hall and the 'Crypt'
Chapel. Unfortunately, M r Brooke
had a meeting to attend and was
unable to show us the rest of the
Palace of Westminster or the House
of Lords. Despite the early finish, it
was a most interesting and
informative visit.
M r Brooke has very kindly offered
another day in February when he will
take another group on a guided tour.
Places for this trip will be limited so
if you are not yet a member of the
Conservative Society, come along to
our committee meetings every Friday
at 12.30pm in Mech Eng 569 or
contact John Ranson, Mech Eng 3.

Improving
As promised, here are a few more
details about the planned changes for
the Weights Club.
We want to provide Club training
for those of you who at present are
unsatisfied with the Club in that
respect.
You can benefit from coaching and
improve your performance within a
good Club atmosphere.
Would anybody interested in taking
a training course next term, please
send a note with their name,
department and the training times and
the type of training they would like,
to Andrew Tay (Physics 2) or Nige
Meyers (Chem Eng 4) by the end of
term. This is merely to get an idea of
the number involved and in no way
commits you.
Ladies, please remember the
Weights C l u b is an equal
opportunities club.
ORIENTEERING
Man-eaters
The ninth event in this year's calendar
took place at Holmbury Hill near
Dorking.
The area was very hilly with
copious amounts of forest and thick
bracken scattered around. There were
many interesting features on the
course including several 'man-eating'
gulleys, which lived up to their
description.
This was not one of the best
weekends for the Club regarding
results but the social atmosphere of
the Club prevailed and spirits
remained moderately high on the
journey home.
Forthcoming events include a
colour-coded one in Chessington on
December 20 and the Christmas
Dinner.

Dense fog stops
Guilds rally
Dense fog in the Thames Valley on
Friday night caused the postponement
of round 4 of the City & Guilds
College Motor Club championship, a
108 mile rally on O.S. map 175.
Visibility was so bad that it would
have been impossible for the crews
to maintain anywhere near the 30mph
average for the event.
The rally will now be fitted into the
already hectic schedule for next term,
which now features 5 rallies, an
autotest, production car trial,
econorun, Mini Miglia, and a circuit
trip plus the continuation of the
Scalextric championship.
Anyone interested in any of the
events should see out noticeboard on
Mech Eng level 3 or come to the
Guilds Office.
REMEMBER
The deadline for ail clubs
articles is Monday lunchtime
before publication.

Grades higher
On Wednesday December 9 over 80
people turned up to grade at
Imperial's Shotokan Karate Club. The
grading examiner on this occasion
was Sensei Otta (8th Dan) and
assistant to Master Enoeda, Chief
Examiner for Great Britain and
Europe. Over 50 beginners succeeded
in gaining their first belt, with some
achieving a double grading ie being
of sufficiently high standard to gain
two belts.
The afternoon began with a training
session with Sensei Otta, who
displayed his great skill in teaching
and motivated everyone in the packed
gym. His excellent technique coupled
with his attention to detail made the
lesson an enjoyable one for everyone
who took part. The traditional
celebratory dinner followed the
grading. It was held this year at the
Grosvenor Hotel, with everyone
making the most of the 'all you can
eat' carvery. The Club was privileged
to have both Sensei Otta and Sensei
Caesar Andrews (our instructor) as
the guests of honour at the dinner.
The officers of the Club would like
to congratulate everyone on passing
their grading and for making this term
so successful. W e hope to see you
training again next year. Finally, we
would like, as always, to thank
Caesar Andrews for the tremendous
amount of effort he puts into the Club
and for the encouragement he gives
