Atos /Wa/: songwriter and backing
vocals, play acoustic guitar, learning
to play the 12 string, ex-zoological,
packed in halfway through second
year.
Pete Hartley: bassist, cracks all the
stupid jokes, writes songs, backing
vocals, plays violin. Didn't do too
well in first half of course, decided
to take time off and worked in snack
bar. Managed Norman's during the
Summer. Now works full time in
Union Bar.
Jez Sone: keyboardist, plays rhythm
and sometimes lead guitar, B i o
graduate, concentrates on music.
Jason Grey: Shouts at everyone in
practice and tells them to shut up; lead
vocals, rhythm guitar some lead,
writes some of the music and some
of the lyrics. Ex-Aero student.
How long has the band been
together?
Pete: A year, one month and twenty
something days.
When you were in the process of
forming a band, were there any
conflicts in deciding what sort'of
musical style you would adopt?
Jason: We were very pushed for time
at the beginning because we had a
couple of jams and then Kev Buckley
(ex Union Bar Manager) suggested
that we play a gig within ten days. We
had to get something together very
fast. Now it was basically my say. I
got a few ideas just by listening to
cover versions, and I had one or two
songs from other bands and my own
songs I wanted to try. We distributed
a lot of tapes around; listen to this,
learn how to play it and come to the
rehearsal. We had three practices and
just did the gig fairly blind really.
When your drummer Andy decided
to leave the band, how did you go
about finding a new drummer?
Jason: When we were working at the
freshers event this year I was talking
to the guitarist from T V World. He
suggested that we try this 'New Line'
agency; they put bands in touch with
musicians and musicians in touch with
bands. They sent us a letter; we filled
in the forms and they keep supplying
us with names of drummers. The
rabbits they supplied have been
particularly helpful and when we get
pissed off with them we can eat them.
That's always assuming they haven't
gnawed through too many alarm
cables first.
The band went through a stage of
calling itself the Baby Deltas. Why
did you decide to change your
name?
Jez: We knew of another band in this
country called Stagefright and there
was this sort of common knowledge
that if you call yourself a name that
another band has they can sue you.
Nas: There was another factor; the
drummer thought the name sucked.
How did you come up with the
name Baby Deltas?
Pete: We were sitting in the Union
Bar haggling. Jason said what about
delta, you know, the logo delta. Nas
suggested that graphically he liked
little delta better. Andy said Baby
Delta. So we were the Baby Delta's.
When we got rid of Andy we got rid
of the name as well.
How did your parents and tutors
react when you told them you
wanted to form a band?
Pete: M y mother said 'Oh I'd better
practice sewing on sequins then'. M y
mum was quite happy about it.
Jez: They weren't particularly
concerned, I don't think. I suspect
they would probably rather I had
applied for a job last year, because
parents like to see their offspring
working.
Nas: My Dad just rang me from Hong
Kong. I had to meet a plane and I
thought, right, it's as good a time as
ever. I told him that I hadn't applied
for any jobs and that I was going to
follow M r Grey around and play in
this band. He said 'Fine, it's your life,
just make sure you meet that plane.'
Jason: Well, the Head of Department,
the only interest he ever shows in the
people on his course is when you
reach the final year and he gives you
this fifteen minuite interview, to make
him look concerned. When he started
asking me about my career—when I
told him that I did n't want to go into
any engineering of any sort or apply
for any jobs because I had set this
band up in College and was really
enjoying it, the look of horror on his
face and the other member of staff
that was in the room was quite
something to behold. It was quite
frightening; he almost had apoplexy.
You played an acoustic repetoire in
the Holland Club recently and it
was received very well. Do you see
Stagefright induldging in more
acoustic songs in the future?
Jason: I certainly found at the Holland
Club, that as a singer, I felt very
naked. You haven't got, dare I say it,
the rest of the band to hide behind.
When there is a familiar sound
pumping out all around me I have the
confidence to switch off to everything
else and just concentrate on singing.
But when I found in the Holland Club,
you could here people chinking
glasses and pulling pints and you're
singing and the volumes are much
more quiet, you can hear things—I
was feeling a lot more vulnerable.
Have you any more gigs lined up in
College?
Pete: Yes, the big one on January
29th, which is Ian Howgate's birthday
party. We're playing in the Concert
Hall, fairly late on in the evening.
That should be a really good gig.
What do you think the prospects of
getting a recording contract are?
Pete: It's a case of being in the right
place at the right time. It's obviously
where we'd like to go. As you play
around, London, for instance, you're
name gets bandied around. If you've
got your posters up, someone's going
to see them. Hopefully one of these
days we will get an A R (Artist and
Repetoire) man to come and listen to
you and if he doesn't, he will mention
you to somebody else and the interest
sort of snowballs. It's just a matter
of chance really.
Who tends to write the songs for the
band?
Pete: Jason does.
Jason: I'd say that would have been
true, but as time progresses I think
more and more people are becoming
involved. Early on, towards the end
of my second year, I'd written a
couple of songs. Nas became involved
in a couple of songs. Jez is now
becoming involved. Whereas Nas
writes in a style, I write in a style,
Jez is a lot more analytical as far as
music is concerned. Because of that
he can input varying styles into a
song.
Do you have any particular
techniques of writing songs?
Jason: A tune is very important first.
I can't write lyrics and fit a song to
it. I've never been able to work like
that.
Nas: It starts from the feeling. A
feeling that came about a week ago
and then suddenly you see yourself
playing this tune and then you put the
tune together and try and write some
words.
Jason: It all stems from something
real that has happened. W e don't
generally try to make it up. So there
is always some sort of idea behind the
song.
Jez: I think Nas and Jason believe that
the tune is the most important thing
for a song whereas I'm differe.: T
think equally important is rhythm ind
texture. I could happily write a song
in one cord if I thought it was vaguely
original.
Are you aiming for any particular
audience?
Pete: People like us. People who
would go out and see a rock group
like Whitesnake or Black Sabbath,
have a good time, enjoy themselves,
drink a lot and get down and
headbang.
What do you think of the music
that's currently in the charts?
Jason: It shows that the market can
really be led. You know, if you see
a jeans advert of a guy stripping off
in a launderette you go out and buy
the record and the record company
cashes in. They're quite mercenary;
they're not worried.
Do you think you could handle
being ripped to pieces in the press?
Pete: A s Oscar Wilde once said,
"there is only one thing worse than
being talked about and that is not
being talked about." If someone says
this band is crap, then at least this
band is being mentioned.
