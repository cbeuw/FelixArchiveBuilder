And what about fake furs?
It seems that neither Lynx nor the
British Fur Trade Association want
people to wear fake furs. The B F T A
complain that there is nothing like a
real fur and that many synthetic
materials have contributed to
atmospheric pollution, acid rain and
destruction of natural habitats.
Meanwhile Lynx believe that fake
furs keep alive the notion that wearing
furs is acceptable and desirable.
Fur factories?
Fur farms are situated all over the
world, with most being found in
Russia, Scandinavia and North
America. Each year more than 40
million animals are farmed for use in
the fur trade which amounts to 85 %
of all furs used worldwide. The rest
is trapped, most of which is done with
the agreement of various governments
which are trying to keep wild animal
populations down.
In Scandinavia alone, there are
around 11,000 fur farms. In the U K
there are only 70 farms, 90% farm
mink and the rest farm arctic blue fox
or fitch. The F u r Breeders
Association recommends that mink
cages should not be less than two
cubic feet with two animals to a cage
plus access to a nest box or pen.
So is farming cruel?
Lynx claim that mink farming is cruel
because wild mink are solitary, highly
territorial animals which have
territories of around 2 miles of
riverbank area and that 2 cubic feet
is not sufficient. They say that
selective breeding has induced stone
deafness, tail sucking, ear chewing
and fur clipping. They also object to
the methods of killing used:
barbiturate injection, inhalation of
carbon monoxide and neck
dislocation.
Fur traders are keen to hit back at
accusations of cruelty. Why, they
argue, should they cause cruelty or
stress to the animals because if an
animal is badly looked after it will
show in its coat. A healthy, well-
looked after mink's skin will always
be worth many times more than a lack
lustre one. They also point out that
mink farms are not factory farms. The
animals live outside in natural light
and are not fed any steroids, drugs or
other substances designed to promote
growth artificially. They also mate
and breed naturally and artificial
insemination is not used. They say
that the most common method of
slaughter is anaesthetic overdose
which first anaesthetises and then
kills. It is the same method that vets
use to put down small domestic pets.
Mark Glover of Lynx still argues
that farming is sophisticated and too
scientific and that the needs of the
creatures themselves are paid little or
no heed. He also believes that the
foodstuffs used to feed mink are a
'scandalous waste of resources,
particularly when so many people
face starvation.' I put this to a
member of the B F T A who said that
at least 80% of the food fed to mink
and foxes is offal and by-products of
the human food industry such as cattle
tripe, fish offal and carcases. It seems
that the B F T A can show their
methods of farming to be more
humane than any chicken or veal
farm.
Trapping?
Lynx have much better grounds for
their campaign when they present the
facts about trapping. A l l trapping in
Britain is illegal although around
100,000 red foxes are snared or
trapped illegally with gin traps each
year in the U K . They have evidence
that trapped animals go to desperate
lengths to escape. The stomachs of
trapped arctic foxes often contain
parts of their own bodies such as teeth
fragments (broken off whilst the
animal bits the trap) or parts of
mangled feet, claws or bits of bones.
Most trapping is done in North
America but only 1% of it by
aboriginals who have made it their
livelihood for centuries. The trapping
regulations in the U S A vary from
state to state. Animals are commonly
left in traps for two or three days. If
they are still alive when the trapper
finds them, they are killed by
clubbing or strangulation. The most
common form of trap is the leghold
trap. A particular type of leghold trap
called the gin trap has been banned
in 64 countries including the U K and
has been described as a 'diabolical
instrument which causes an incredible
amount of suffering'. Despite this the
UK imports 2 million wild animals
which have been caught using leghold
traps.
The B F T A accept these figures but
point out that 85% of fur used by
British fur traders is from farms and
that trapping is no reason to ban fur
completely.
The Canadian Government is a
fervent supporter of trapping as a
form of pest control. They have
produced many propaganda sheets on
why trapping is the best method and
how many people's livelihoods would
be taken away if trapping was banned.
They say that such animals cannot be
shot as it is ineffective against the
species which are mainly nocturnal.
All the trappers are trained and
licenced. They also have quotas
which they must not exceed.
Canadian trappers also claim to check
their traps twice daily so that other
predators cannot take the catch away.
They say that animals die quickly in
the Canadian Arctic conditions and
that the traps used now do not cause
lesions as the arms are padded with
rubber. They say that gin traps are not
used and that all Lynx publicity is
misleading.
The Canadian Government have
managed to persuade Greenpeace to
halt its campaigns against the fur
trade. They decided that, although the
fur trade was very damaging to
millions of wild animals each year,
their campaign was threatening the
way of life of many native peoples.
This followed pleas by Indigenous
Survival International that 'the anti-
seal and anti-wild fur campaigns
directly or indirectly are condemning
our people to a slow genocide of a
culture that has cared since time
immemorial about lands and animals.'
However, more and more traders
are shunning wild pelts in favour of
farmed pelts which are thicker, larger
and glossier.
The future?
The B F T A are not keen to admit it
but more and more fur firms are going
under as less and less furs are sold in
this country. However, the worldwide
production has gone up by 10% this
year. Fur will still go on selling even
if none of it is sold in Britain.
The B F T A are very sensitive to all
the bad press they have received. N o
animal in danger of extinction is sold
as a fur coat in this country but they
cannot deny that other countries'
traders may flout the law.
Meanwhile Lynx supporters are
growing in strength with their new
Christmas campaign aimed at
highlighting 'greedy furriers making
profits out of pain'. Emotive words
which seem to have been very
effecth e over the last few years but
how many British furriers are making
huge profits now?
