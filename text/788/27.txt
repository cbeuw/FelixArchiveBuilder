Even today, few things can rival
homosexuality when it comes to
setting the cat amongst the pigeons.
There's simply nothing quite like it
for precipitating a scandal, provoking
an outcry, baffling the 'experts' or
just disrupting the day to day tedium
of a dull straight-orientated society.
Here then is a farcical merry-go-
round of idle cant, blind prejudice,
convoluted theories and conflicting
statements as entertaining as they are
controversial, maddening or
depressing.

'Do you know if your vicar is
homosexual?' asked The Sun
newspaper last week, before helpfully
providing us with its own version of
'10 ways to spot one.'
A G O O D S L A G G I N G
1. What is homosexuality?
'Homosexuality is a sickness, just as
are rape or wanting to become head
of General M o t o r s . ' — Eldridge
Cleaver, US black power leader.
'Homosexuality is funny, provided
it's on the telly; off the telly
homosexuals are only fit for being
punched up.'—Philip Adams,
Australian TV critic.
2. The closet—better out than in?
'It's not camp or cunning to stay in
the closet—it's cowardly.'—Lisa
Power, gay activist.
'Neither confirm it, nor deny it.'—
Quinten Crisp.
'It is better to be hated for what you
are than loved for what you are
not.'—Andre Gide, writer.
T dislike the fact that your sexuality
should be your most important social
categorisation. '—Simon Napier-Bell,
pop group manager.
'People who won't come out are
ashamed of what they do in their own
home. It's like putting yourself in
prison, locking the door but holding
onto the key.'—Harvey Fierstein.
3. Gays and politics
'We want to build a society in which
we encourage rather than restrict the
variety and richness of human
nature.'—Margaret Thatcher quoted
by CGHE. (JP says 'what
hypocrisy'.)
'If you want a queer for a neighbour
vote labour. If you don't want to be
gay join the conservatives today.'—
Anne Robertson, Tory delegate at '85
conference.
T haven't been kissed by Peter
Tatchell! '—Slogan used by liberals to
smear Tatchell during the
Bermondsey bi-election 1983.
'If Hitler returned and took over this
country now, most gay men would
probably think, wow, what sexy
uniforms—and order another pint.'—
Lisa Power, gay activist.
4. Gays and God
'Islam is not against masturbation, but
considers as sins homosexuality, birth
control and nudity. Wives should be
discouraged from going to beauty
salons and similar places, to avoid
lesbianism.'—Muslim sex manual.
'If G o d had meant us to have
homosexuals he would have created
Adam and Bruce. '—Anita Bryant, US
homophobe.
'.. .the treasures of the Vatican would
not be enough to compensate those
whom we have injured with our
prejudices, our sexual illiteracy and
our ignorant and conscious
cruelty.' —Former RC nun.
5. Men in Frocks
'There is more to be learned from
wearing a dress for a day, than there
is from wearing a suit for life.'—
Larry Mitchell, writer.
When asked by a reporter why he was
wearing a woman's dress David
Bowie is said to have replied: 'It's a
man's dress.'
6. Sex & Violence
'Show me an army of inverts and I'll
show y o u an army that is
invincible. '—Warrior leader,
commenting on the Ancient Greeks'
military strength, attributed to the
love bonds between their men.
'Perhaps men fight each other because
they are afraid of loving one
another.'—Jim Cotter, Anglican
priest.
'I'm all for bringing back the birch,
but only between consenting
adults.'—Gore Vidal.
7. Literature
'To love oneself is the beginning of
a life long romance.'—Oscar Wilde.
'What the public really loathes in
homosexuality is not the thing itself
but having to think about it. If it could
be slipped into our midst overnight or
legalised overnight by a decree in
small print, there would be few
protests.'—E M Forster, 1960.
8. Sun Spots
Excerpts from Britain's most morally
upstanding institution.
'The filthy vicars in our midst—
October 2.
'Gay vicar and his lover in AIDS
storm'—September 30.
'Sally Army boss preyed on bible
boys'—October 7.
'Pulpit poofs can stay'—November
12.
Finally a Joke!
Question: What's the difference
between the Sun and the Beano?
Answer: Four pence.
Compiled from issues of Gay Times
and The Sun by James Papa(SLAGS).
1. The older vicar who tries very hard
to look younger. Many gays are
obsessed about their age. They dress
in an obviously young and trendy
way.
2. The vicar who takes an undue
interest in the ceremonies of the
Church. The incense and pretty robes
associated with Church ritual can
often be a turn on.
3. A tendency to he a peeping Tom.
The vicar who is always in the locker
room with his choirboys or scouts
could well be getting a kick out of
watching them undress. He may not
be a threat as such and will always
have a legitimate reason for being
there.
4. The vicar who takes an undue
interest in exposing or condemning
sexual scandal. Too great a public
interest in sex can disguise a personal-
obsession.
5. The person who disappears for two
midweek days on a regular basis. He
could be off visiting a lover that he
does not wish to bring to his parish
for fear of being exposed as a
homosexual.
6. The vicar who lives alone and is
a confirmed bachelor. However there
are many gays who are married with
children.
7. Insecure and introverted vicars
could just be trying to hide and fight
their true feelings. Many agonise
about reconciling their homosexuality
with Christianity.
8. The vicar who prefers the company
of women. He will have lots of
women friends. This is a way of
further disguising his true sexual
leanings.
9. The parson who gives a very manly
handshake after the Sunday service.
He wants to emphasize h i s
masculinity to his parishoners.
10. A n undue interest in interior
design and a fondness of cats.
