FILMS
Christmas comes but once a year, and
so do those evergreen films you've all
seen before. Such as Jaws, The
Wizard of Oz, The Sound of Music,
The Great Escape, etc, etc. The pick
of the bunch must be Ben Hur, not
for the oscars but that it's such a
monumental film. As for films from
the 80s, three seem to stand out from
the crowd. The Woman in Red was
a big hit, with Mrs Wilder co-starring
with her husband in a comedy only
spoiled by the music. There is Terms
of Enderarment, the much acclaimed
tragi-comedy. But the best film by far
is The Killing Fields, which portrays
the war in Cambodia without any of
the 'bang, bang, you're dead' stuff.
The sound track deserved an oscar
and overall The Killing Fields puts
Platoon where it should be: on the
Rambo pile.
