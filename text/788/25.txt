a ridge. Then it was only a matter of
negotiating the occasionally knife-
edged snowy ridge, taking in the
peaks on the way.
Returning to the towns and cities of
Pakistan made a change and had
interesting moments (we found it hard
to believe when we were shown some
grass in Rawalpindi—the International
Cricket Ground) but it wasn't until we
landed back in misty, wet, heavily
built-up, machine-ridden London that
the reaj shock came. Everything was
so familiar, but with Pakistan such an
intense, recent experience in our
minds, London seemed like a dream.
I don't mind adfnitting finding seventy
miles per hour on the M 4 quite
frightening for a while.
The expedition was conceived,
planned and executed by ourselves,
nine IC undergraduates and a
Cambridge postgraduate, with advice
and help from the Royal Geographical
Society and the Imperial College
Exploration Board. Along with a
number of industrial sponsors, they
helped fund us, though we spent
several hundred pounds each
ourselves. The message is that all you
need is the desire to do something and
the willingness to work hard for it.
The experience will be worthwhile,
as I expect members of the several
College expeditions of last year would
agree.
Trying to express the highlights of a
ten-week, ten-person expedition is
hard enough when you are talking to
people—in the space available here all
I can do is offer some of my strongest
impressions.
The people were almost without
exception friendly and c o -
operative—the only exceptions being
in business matters such as perks for
the porters or the jeep driver who
refused to take us all the way back to
Skardu because the police there
wanted him for gun-running. W e
taught them football during rests on
the walk-in—and began to regret it as
their enthusiasm far exceeded our
available energy and our ability to
repair the beach ball we were using.
We watched the moonrise from our
advanced base camp, several miles
away and higher up than our main
camp. It began at dusk as a pale
silvery glow running along the tops
of the snow-plastered Meru group, a
glow which expanded and brightened,
washing out the stars all round. Then
the first sliver of moon appeared, an
astonishingly bright splinter—as
though someone had lifted the curtain
of the night sky up from the grey
mountain silhouette to reveal a cold
silvery sunlight beyond. As it rose it
was as though the area had been
floodlit. Sharp shadows lay
everywhere and the ice and snow on
the mountains and glaciers around us
gleamed as thousands of little shards
of ice reflected moonlight at us; this
superimposed on the general
fluorescent appearance of the moonlit
snow. Just as the sky is much blacker
and the stars sharper, the moonlight
seems ten times as intense as in
Britain—we could hardly look at it.
We watched the meteor showers in
awe, lying in our sleeping bags, heads
out of the tent, wondering when the
next one would flash by.
Some of us met a bear, which
immediately ran off (and considering
our appearance after a few weeks, I'm
not surprised). A lone eagle
occasionally soared over the area and
a particularly cheeky ibex chewed up
the inner of a tent we'd been using up
the hill by base camp as a marker!
(Sorry, Exploration Board.)
We flew out from Skardu in a
Fokker Friendship—a plane of limited
cruising altitude which meant we had
an astonishing flight, threading our
way along gorges and around
mountains, sometimes only a couple
of hundred feet from a rock face
towering over us. We were treated to
sights of yet more famous and
magnificent mountains, the early
morning lighting lending a magical air
of unreality to the whole thing. After
seven weeks on foot suddenly we
were soaring over villages and
valleys, the cultivation terraces picked
out by the low sun. Never have I
found flight more exciting.
Possibly the best feeling of all
(apart fom getting back to Britain)
was sitting on top of a peak, knowing
that almost certainly no-one had ever
been there before, eating a few raisins
or a Crunchy bar. It would usually be
just after sunrise (we climbed in the
very early morning while the snow
was still frozen—allowing us to
ascend even 70-80" slopes using ice
axes and crampons) and we would
survey our half-familiar area from a
new vantage-point, seeing distant
behemoths lighting up in the first
sunlight, watching the pinks and
yellows of dawn rush down the
mountains and ridges as the sun rose.
Sharp, deep shadows picked out the
textures in rocky mountainsides,
smooth rounded ones the snow,
i moulded to the underlying rock. A s
the sun rose, illumination became
more even and the texture faded
away, the details dissolving into the
bulk of the mountains, distant ridges
becoming indistinguishable from the
background. Then, with the show
over, we'd head down.
Possibly the worst feeling was
being horribly unwell in Islamabad,
in an 'air-conditioned' hotel room at
30° C , too weak to walk—but I was
unlucky in that, most people escaped
it.

Going places
Have you ever wanted to travel to
exotic parts of the world, to
investigate foreign cultures, explore
uncharted regions, to boldly go where
not IC student has gone before,
etc.. .but have never had the necessary
money or perhaps companions for
your venture?
Well, have no fear, Imperial
College's Exploration Board is here!
The Exploration Board, funded by
Imperial College, I C U and various
other organisations, provides financial
support to expeditions organised by
IC students, which it has approved.
The Board do not ' r u n '
expeditions—it is entirely up to the
students concerned to set up and run
an expedition. Rather the Board meets
some (usually not all) of the
expedition costs, loans some
expedition equipment and provides
insurance for expedition members and
equipment. The Board also gives
expeditions official status as an
Imperial College venture—useful
when dealing with potential sponsors
and foreign governments.
So how do you get these goodies?
Well, once you have formed a
reasonably detailed plan and a rough
team you should contact either the
Chairman D r R C Schroter of Aero
Eng or the Hon Sec M r D M C
Adlington at 15 Princes Gardens. It
would be helpful if you could also
contact a student representative:
Patrick Coleman (RSMU)
Ina El-Khadi (RCSU)
David Grimshaw (ICU)
Richard Hardiman ( C & G U )
This should be done as soon as
possible, so that it can be discussed
at the last Board Meeting for this
academic year on Wednesday
February 3.
You don't have to be an Indiana
Jones or even a member of an
'adventurous' club (like Scout and
Guide or Sub-Aqua) to go on an
expedition—although any relevant
skills would be helpful. The W h y ,
Where and When are entirely up to
you, although it should have a
reasonable purpose (getting a suntan
or getting stoned on foreign booze are
not reasonable) and the expedition
members should be good
ambassadors for Imperial College.
Recent expeditions include an
ornithological trip to the Cameroons,
monitoring pollution levels
underwater along the Sinai Peninsula
and Mount McKinley in Canada.
So c'mon, get off your butt and into
a wide world ripe for exploring!
