F e a t u r e s
Just messing about on
the river?
It was a cold, grey
Sunday morning in
the middle of
November. The sky
was heavy and a
cold wind was
blowing up from
the Thames
estuary. Imperial
College Union Boat
Club was setting
out to practise for
another prestigious
race that was
coming up the
following weekend.
And the heavens
opened....
The Imperial College Union Boat
Club has been one of the most
successful College clubs this year.
The highlight was their win at Henley
over the summer, where the top squad
took the Visitors Cup. This was
followed by a 9th placing at the World
Student Games, where C . Behrens,
G . Pooley, J. Waller, J. Walker and
cox I. Scutts represented Great Britain
in the Men's Coxed Fours. But these
are only two of the Club's successes:
at this year's Club dinner it took
Captain Robert Gee nearly ten
minutes to list the past year's
achievements.
The Club has become well known
to the rest of IC as a high-spending
society which enjoys the patronage of
certain influential College officials.
Last year the Club annoyed Union
officers by buying a secondhand eight
from Oxford with the help of College
Assistant Secretary Michael Arthur.
The Club had tried to persuade the
Union Finance Committee to buy the
boat with money brought forward on
its long term spending plan. When
U F C decided that their claim could
not be rushed through, and would
have to be judged alongside claims
from other Union clubs, the boat was
bought with a loan from the College
account. Boat club later tried to
recoup the money from the Union.
( U F C has agreed to pay the money
this year, when the boat was
originally due to be purchased).
I was more interested in the Club
itself rather than its financial
arguments with the Union, so I
decided to go down to its Putney
boathouse to see for myself what the
members did with their spare time.
M y first trip was during the summer
holidays, when Boathouse Manager
and Club Coach Bill Mason was
repairing the boats and oars in
preparation for the new academic
year. I was met by Bill and Robert
Gee, who gave me an extensive tour
of the Boathouse. In the training pools
on top of the building new members
can get the feel of rowing and learn
elementary techniques before being
let loose on the river. The top
squadders also get to use the tanks
whenever there is fog on the river or
when they want to study their own
techniques in mirrors. There are three
old ergometers by the side of the pool
which strengthen muscles and help
with breathing. Robert explained that
time on these machines is very limited
since there are over 80 active
members. He also expects the Club
membership to increase by 30 next
year when St Mary's merges with
Imperial, which will stretch the
facilities they have even more.
At first sight of the boatroom, there
seemed to be more boats than any
rowing club could wish for, but on
closer inspection it was clear that
many were old or cannibalised. After
a boat has been raced a certain
number of times it loses its speed.
New boats are always rigid which
makes them fast but with constant
battering this rigidity is lost and the
boat becomes slower. This is a
particular problem with the new
carbon fibre boats at the top end of
the range. These are used very rarely
and the top class boats in the
Boathouse are only used for
prestigious races. A boat will also lose
its speed when it has to be repaired
with plastic padding. It is essential
that the oarsmen have a top class boat
for racing otherwise they start losing
rather than winning. Bill and Rob
both believe that there is no point in
having the Club if it can't compete in
top level competitions. This is why
they jumped at the chance of
purchasing the Oxford eight last year.
Novices are started in the old boats
after they have completed their
training in the tanks. After they have
won a certain number of races they
are no longer considered to be novices
and have to move up one class. The
better the rower becomes the better
the boat the rower is allowed to train
in. Most of the boats are wood. These
tend to keep their rigidity for a longer
time than carbon fibre boats but are
not as quick. Bill described how
difficult it was to maintain the boat
'heirachy'. If he allowed any team to
use a better boat than they were able
to handle then the whole boat
preservation thing would break down.
The boats in the Boathouse are not
used exclusively by the Club. Some
boats belong to private individuals
and others are leant out to other
college's teams to use. It would be
very easy to say that the Club owns
too many boats but each one has
specific use, whether it be for the
Rugby teams that row on Morphy
Day or the top squad. Bill told me that
for some of the really top events they
had to hire or borrow another club's
boat as the current boats aren't
adequate.
Upstairs in the Club lounge we
looked at the many cups in the trophy
cabinet and talked further about the
Club.'
Talking to Bill it is easy to see why
the Club has been so successful. He
is an incredibly dedicated coach who
has complete faith in his teams'
abilities. He is very keen to stress that
success" can only be brought about
with hard work. It is only the
members who share Bill's enthusiasm
and dedication for rowing that survive
the rigours of Boat Club life. Bill has
little tolerance for members who wish
to row occasionally and makes it clear
that rowing time is too precious to be
used up on joyrides.
He is convinced that the more
training his top rowers do, the better
they perform in race situations.
We became so involved in Boat
Club talk that it was three hours later
that I finally made my way back to
