I was in Earls Court Station waiting for
a tube when I was knocked senseless by
an amazing conundrum.
'Will running down an escalator
increase my chances of catching a train?'
When I reverted to mathematical jargon
and used lots of big words it become
apparent that the the probability of
catching a train is the same whether you
run down an escalator or not. Put it
another way—if you wait on the,
platform long enough then a train will;
eventually turn up (barring nuclear war,j
the abolition of London Underground!
and Ian Howgate's underwear). It is
obvious, even to i pygmy, that the
probability of catching a train must
always be one.
But, you might query; if a person runs
down the escalator will it increase his
chances of catching the next train?
In order to analyse the problem
properly we must define what we mean
by the next train.
Definition 1; The Next Train. The next
train is defined to be the first train to
arrive on the platform taken from the
moment when the subject first sets foot
on the escalator.
It follows...
Definition 2; Catching the Next Train.
The Next Train is said to be caught when
the subject arrives on the platform when
the doors are open or in the process of
opening.
Similarly...
Definition 3: Missing the Next Train.!
The Next Train is said to be missed!
when the subject arrives on the platform'
when the doors have closed or are in the
process of closing.

It is obvious to anyone with half a|
braincell (Sorry Dave, no offence) that1
the probability of catching the next train
will depend upon the following,
variables... I
T The time taken for a stationary
subject to reach the bottom of a
particular escalator.
C The coefficient of
runningdowntheescalatorness
K B i g K
A The time taken for the Next Train
to arrive, timed from the point when the
subject first steps foot on the escalator.
W The waiting time between trains
d The length of time the train is on
the platform with the doors open.
If we define Big K to be a constant
equal to the time taken to run from the
bottom of the escalator to the platform
it is immediately obvious that the
probability of catching the train can be
represented by the following Heaviside
step function.
?=H((fl+ d)-(Lstk))
If P is 0, the subject will miss the
train, and if P is 1 the train will be
caught. In ether words...

Hence we can see that the probability
of catching the Next Train can be
represented by the following
expression...

What does this mean in practice?
Well, if trains arrive every 300 seconds,
the escalator taking 30 seconds with a
further 30 seconds to reach the platform
and the train stays on the platform for
20 seconds, and if we assume that the
coefficient of
runningdowntheescalatorness is 2 then
the probability of catching the train is
found to be 92%. Similarly, if we
remain stationary on the escalator the
chances of catching the next train are
found to be 86%. Amazing huh ! There

is only a an 8% improvement if you run
down the escalator.
Special offer. As a special offer to
readers of FELICS, you can send off
for a table of the parameters for these
equations, tabulated for the most
frequently used tube stations. Just thi
of the effortyou could save by avoiding
unecessary running. Simply send an
empty cornflakes packet to me, Earl
Grey c/o the Physics Department.
Next Week we look at bicycles.

'The lectures were tremendously stimulating and the
lab sessions were enormously motivating. I found the
tutorial sessions orgasmic and the problem sheets gave
me a real high. I used to swap sheets with my friends
from other courses when I had finished my own. In my
spare time I studied serbo-croat and origami.'
