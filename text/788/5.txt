First Footing
It would seem quite strange that
anyone should be willing to break off
their New Year's Eve/Day viewing
of non stop Terry Wogan to wait
outside in the cold for a few minutes
before the clocks strike 12. What is
even more strange is that they are
holding a piece of coal, some silver
coins, a knife and occasionally some
salt—oh and of course they must be
male and dark haired. Once the
television sounds of Big Ben have
finished the man walks in through the
front door, and without so much ado
they promptly walk out through the
back door. The whole purpose is to
let the new year into the house and
the old one out. On returning this
gentleman puts down his coal (or coke
if you live in a smokeless zone) and
silver and cuts the Christmas cake
with the knife (yes, the Christmas
cake is not eaten until New Year). He
then wishes everyone in the house a
happy New Year with the glass of
whisky (sherry will do at a pinch) he
has just been given).
The custom is common throughout
Scotland, Durham, Northumberland
and even as far south as Y o r k s h i r e -
northern emigrees have introduced
the custom to all corners of Britain.
The reason behind the objects is very
obscure it is considered that the piece
of coal was the original token of good
luck, the silver has come from the
tradition of giving new born babies
silver as a present, and the knife most
probably from the necessity to cut the
cake afterwards. The good point
about the custom (if you are male and
darked haired) is that you can
welcome in the new year all morning
until you run out of neighbours or fall
down. The true art of successful first
footing is to ensure that even after the
amounts of alcohol one can still eat
New Year's Day dinner.
