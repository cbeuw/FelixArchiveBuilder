Photocopier
I have taken delivery of a new
photocopier for the Union Office.
This will be in action next term as
soon as the control system arrives
(hopefully in the week before term).
The control card system will consist
of magnetic strip cards with a number
of units encoded. They will be bought
for cash or charged to the club/society
concerned. The number of units can
be varied to suit your requirements or
budget. Also cards will be available
with a small number of units for
private use.
The machine itself will do A 4 , A 3
and variable enlargements or
reductions.
Transport
I am taking in weekend bookings for
next term. It would help considerably
if people could bring them in before
the end of term or right at the start
of next term. This will help me to
even out the bookings for next term.
Graduate Studies
Last Wednesday I attended a meeting
of the Graduate Studies Committee in
place of Ian. At the meeting there
came up the issue of European
students registering for MSc's. At the
moment in, say, Germany, a student
will spend five or six years doing their
first degree. The issue was about
allowing them to be registered for a
MSc before the finish of their first
degree. At the moment, even though
they may be of sufficient standard to
undertake an M S c course, they are
not allowed to register for the degree.
Happily, Graduate Studies Committee
has sent a recommendation to the
Board of Studies that they exercise
more flexibility towards different
education systems. They will first
have to co-opt a group of 'experts' in
the European further education
systems to determine what level will
be required for registration for an
MSc.
Office Closing
The Union Office will close on
December 21st and then reopen on
January 4th.

AP shares
As this year's Alternative Prospectus
Editor (yet to be ratified), I would like
to take this opportunity of telling you
what my job will be and how you can
help me.
It is proposed that, with the money
refunded by the printers last year
owing to their poor quality printing,
a supplement to the last A P shall be
made, in order to bring it more up to
date. This supplement will be 8-10
pages long (or longer if we get enough
help) and will consist mainly of
updated departmental information,
and a special article on the merger
with St Mary's Medical School.
If you want to write, or help write,
one of these articles, or if you've got
any ideas you would like to see in the
A P then contact me through F E L I X ,
IC Radio or Chemistry 1 pigeonholes.
I will need all the help I can get (and
you get your name in print at the end
of it).
Bye for now,
Martin Peck,
Prospective AP Editor.
