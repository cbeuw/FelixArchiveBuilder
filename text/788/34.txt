BOAT
Farcity boat race
Four IC crews entered IBIS head. The
first eight boated on time, followed
shortly by two novice eights. The
senior C crew were one man short,
had no boat and lost their start
position but eventually arrived at the
start line as the last crew, went off.
They did well to finish 14th, 40
seconds behind the top squad in 3rd
position. The novice crews finished
well, the first being 20 seconds behind
the senior Cs.
BADMINTON
Ladies' Day
All three teams are still in the U A U
Team Championships. The ladies,
having finished second in their group
had a play-off with U C L which they
won pretty convincingly 6-3. The
men's 1st team also finished runners-
up in the group and are now through
to the last 16 having beaten City
University 7-2. They now have to
play the champions, Loughborough.
The men's 2nds were cruising to
pole position in their league but
slipped up against Kent by losing 8-1.
Kent did have a strong side but the
2nds were not helped by the absence
of 3 players, 2 of whom were playing
for the lsts. Anyway, the match was
closer than the 8-1 deficit suggested
with Richard Etheridge and Tim
Bartle just losing out to the
opposition's first pair, and Ian
Mitchell and Andy McAleer losing
18-17 in the final game against their
2nds. Despite this defeat the team
finished runners-up in the group and
are through to the last 16 having had
a bye in the play-offs.
In the London Colleges Knock-Out
Cup IC are into the semi-finals having
had a resounding victory over St
Georges, 9-2. Richard Langford and
Alastair McMaster certainly got their
money's worth by beating the
Georges' first pair 15-11, 17-18 and
15-11. That particular match was still
going on when the third match started
on the adjacent court. In the ladies'
doubles IC were again more powerful
overall and won 2 of the 3 rubbers,
but special mention should be made
of J Cohen and Monique Yeo. They
played remarkably well in their first
match together and only narrowly lost
in the second game 15-12.
Georges won their other rubber—
the mixed—but not before Richard
Langford and Uta Boltze had made
short work of their singles.

MESSAGE FROM THE BOSS
The divisional play-offs for the U A U
Challenge Round finished last week
with Imperial College teams showing
a high level of success. Particularly
notable achievements were the Rugby
1st X V and Ladies' Squash V who
won all thier games. The complete list
of teams who qualified automatically
by winning their groups is:
R u g b y - l s t X V , 2nd X V , 3rd X V
H o c k e y - 2 n d X I
Squash—Ladies' V
Fencing—Men's, Ladies'
The following teams managed to
secure play-offs by coming either
second or third in their groups:
Hockey—1st X I
Badminton—1st V I , 2nd VI,
Ladies' VI
Football-2nd X I , 3rd X I
Squash—1st V
Of these teams all but the football
and squash teams progressed to the
Challenge round (the top 16
universities in the country).
This represents probably the best
year for Imperial College teams in the
U A U Championships since our
affiliation in 1983. I would like to
extend the A C C ' s best wishes to these
teams and wish them well for the first
knock-out round in January.

VOLLEYBALL
Key to success
Sometimes it is easy to get paranoid
about a club's luck. In recent years,
the U A U regional championships
have not always gone as planned for
Imperial. Two years ago, the men
were disqualified for fielding a
woman after winning the final, and
last year, the entry form got lost in
the post (honest!), the team only
gaining entry after turning up on the
off-chance and grovelling profusely.
This year, it was going to be different.
This year, the key to the minibus
snapped off in the lock two hours
before the start of the tournament...
A l l was not lost. After calming a
near-hysterical secretary, the
women's team just caught a train to
Brighton and managed to arrive
almost, well nearly almost, on time.
Upon presentation of half a van key,
the team was forgiven, and rushed on
court to crush a stroppy Brunei team
in two quick sets. This glory was
short-lived, however, as despite some
magnificent spiking from Margaret
Asomaning and Anna Dahlkvist, a
well-drilled Sussex team snatched
victory in two sets which should have
gone the other way. The women were
still in the semi-finals though by
virtue of the first win, to meet a very
strong Kent side. This produced the
most exciting match in both days of
the tournament, as IC met an
opponent of similar spiking power.
Throughout, the team were under
strong pressure, but fought strongly
due to the clean setting of captain
Kristina Sagen, Going one set down,
they recovered to take the second with
Louisa Leung and Eleni Papa proving
the effectiveness of the intelligently
placed return, and Stephanie Samuels
displaying remarkable reflexes on the
back court. The third set went to 15
points apiece, but then Kent pulled
ahead to remove IC from the
competition.
The next day saw the arrival of the
men's competition, which was not
quite so exciting, despite attempts to
liven things up with out mascot: an
inflatable crocodile called
Palookaville. The first match was
against an initially impressive side
from U E A , who collapsed under the
smouldering spikes of Walter Sextro
and Steve Pickett. After that, it was
all downhill...for the opposition.
C r i s p setting from Fernando
Gonzalez and Luca Grassano meant
that spikes fell in an almost
continuous downpour. Sussex and
City both succumbed quickly, as did
Kent in the semi-finals, although they
did a nice synchronised warm-up. The
final re-introduced the men to U E A
who seemed to have a certain hang
dog look, but took eight points off
Imperial in the second set; the highest
tally of the day. And now, after a two
day trip to the seaside, without a
minibus, it seems that Palookaville
will be heading North to the national
finals in Loughborough next year.
MIXED HOCKEY
Anna's traumas
IC Mixed 2—St Thomas (A) 0
In a game dominated by IC, the ladies
played a major role with Penny
causing trouble up front whilst Debbie
frustrated the oppositions advances.
IC's first goal was scored by Penny
after a break by Paul Hanrahan. His
shot beat the keeper but was cleared
off the line. However, Penny made
sure of the rebound.
Some excellent goalkeeping by
Spence, who is accustomed to playing
with his feet, helped to maintain this
lead into the second half, during
which Brenan Farmer came off to
increase the standard of umpiring.
Shrewd tactics by Dave Jennings
and Benjamin Turner at defensive
short corners ensured that no shots
would go in at the near post. Also in
defence, the diminutive A n n a
distinguished herself after squaring up
to a one-on-one with their centre
forward. She bravely laid in a solid
tackle which not only stole the ball
from the forward but left him crashing
to the the ground. It took Anna
several minutes to recover from this
traumatic experience!
A free hit allowed Dave to slot the
ball through to Paul who calmly
placed it inside the right post,
allowing the great man to score in his
last game for IC before he heads off
to Oz—good luck Paul.
BASKETBALL
Excuses!
IC's basketball team travelled down
to Exeter last Wednesday for the
Second Round of the U A U
Championships. A full squad of 12
travelled down and immediately took
advantage of Exeter's excellent
facilities by frequenting the Union's
canteen and 'Ram Bar'.
The match against Exeter was
bound to be hard as they were runners
up in the competition last year.
Perhaps this, combined with the
lengthy travelling, was the reason for
IC's erratic play. It certainly wasn't
the best that the team could do, but
to the team's credit they did not relent
as Exeter continued to pile up the
points. Imperial continued fighting to
the last seconds thereby gaining much
respect.
Have a sporty Christmas,
Hector and Dom.
