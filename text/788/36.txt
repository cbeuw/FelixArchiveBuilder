UL KORFBALL
Not just a silly name Local
Football
Preview
For those of you who don't know,
korfball is a mixed sex sport
originating in Holland. The game lies
somewhere between netball and
basketball, although most of the
standard techniques are peculiar to
korfball. Each side consists of 4 girls
and 4 boys and is split into two groups
of 2 boys and 2 girls. Each group is
confined to their own half of the pitch,
one group attacking the oponents
basket, the other defending their own.
The groups change ends and roles
after every 2 goals. The baskets are
higher than in either basketball or
netball, have no backboard and play
can continue behind them.
Last weekend Nottingham
University organised a tournament for
all the student teams in Britain. The
event was well attended and included
13 teams.
U L took a squad of 10 players,
including 5 novices, and, although
they have played a few club matches
this season, they had played no other
student sides and so had no real idea
of their standing. It therefore came as
a pleasant start to the tournament to
win all 3 group matches, beating
Brighton B 7-1, Notts B 3-1 and
Lancaster 5-2.
It was unfortunate that the
University had only one indoor pitch
available so half the group matches
were played outside in freezing fog
where passing from one half of the
pitch to the other was close to
At last, on Saturday December 5, we
scored our first win of the season. At
Alexandra Palace on a cold, miserable
day over a hilly course we creamed
the rest of the opposition to win the
University of London
Championships. The first men's team
were so far ahead of the rest that their
last man could have finished bottom
of the pack and we'd still have won!
Our top runners were Trevor Shaw
who came 4th followed closely by
Hubertus Schuite-Huxel in 5th place
who has vowed that Trev isn't going
to beat him again. They were well
I supported by Alex Gaskell and Dave
Knight who were 10th and 11th
respectively. The team was completed
by a pair of real leaders! I mean our
illustrous captain of cross-country and

impossible unless you used telepathy!
Through to the quarter finals, U L
encountered the reputedly strong
Brighton A team, only to beat them
4-1 with yet more goals from Russell
Norton (IC) and Helen Grinyer who
had been scoring all day. In the semi-
final U L faced Oxford A , this proved
the toughest match to date, although
the scoreline of 5-1 to U L suggests
otherwise.
So U L made it to the final against
the favouritesâ€”York. The final
consisted of two fifteen-minute halves
rather than the twenty minute games
played previously. It began with York
scoring almost immediately, but U L
levelled quickly and at half time the
score was 4-3 to U L ; after a further
exchange of goals, U L scored three
in quick succession including a
spectacular effort from Takis Frantzis
(IC) to take the score to 8-4. Although
York scored again and were also
awarded a dubious penalty, U L held
out and were thoroughly delighted to
win 8-6.
If you are interested in playing
korfball, or just want to see what it's
like, we train every Thursday at 6
o'clock at Swiss Cottage Sports
Centre and play league matches every
Sunday in Battersea. W e also have
trips to Germany and Holland next
year that are open to all Club
members. For further information

or Russell Norton (Chem Eng 3).
athletics M r John Hugh Porter who
was 16th and one of the opposition,
Matthew L y n a s , the Captain
Orienteering, whose services we are
grateful for. We were also the only
college to put out a full second men's
team, who in finishing 4th beat a lot
of other first teams. Well done lads!
Now for the girls (including Jane).
Well, at last we got a team together
and by jove, what a shock and all that,
they got a medal! Well done to
Alison, Alison, Kamala and Jane who
ran well to finish third.
Let's keep up the good work
everyone. Our first race next term is
the Southern Counties Cross-Country
Championships at Trent Park on
January 9. See you there.
London is a great place to go and see
live league football, with 12 clubs
vying for the attentions of the public.
Each week in the city there are at least
5 games to choose from and I intend
to preview these to whet your
appetite.
Queens Park Rangers vs
Coventry City (Division 1)
Friday December 18, Loftus Road
Loftus Road is the venue for a game
between high flying Q P R and cup
winners Coventry. The plastic pitch
will probably favour the home team
and with Coventry finding it hard to
score this season, a QPR victory looks
the most likely result. Q P R have a
young side with the likes of Martin
Allen and England reserve goalkeeper
David Seaman being outstanding.
Coventry have 'Chelsea reject' David
Speedie, always looking for trouble,
and big Steve Ogrizovic in goal.
Nearest tube: Shepherds Bush.
Wimbledon vs Norwich City
(Division 1)
Friday December 18, Plough Lane
A match between middle of the table
Wimbledon and lowly Norwich.
Wimbledon have a reputation of being
a dirty side with hard men of the like
of John Fashano and Carlton
Fairweather. Norwich are having a
bad season but with the likes of Kevin
Drinkell and Steve Bruce in the side,
they are sure to pull up the table.
A draw is a probable result.
Nearest tube: Wimbledon Park.
Arsenal vs Everton (Division 1)
Saturday December 19, Highbury
The game of the day between ex-table
toppers Arsenal and league
champions Everton. The young
Arsenal side had a great run to lead
the table in November, albeit with
their famous slice of luck and
sometimes boring play. They do have
exciting players of the likes of David
Rocastle and the reliable Tony
Adams. Everton are not playing their
best football at the moment, but with
players like the hard working Peter
Reid and the sharp shooting Graeme
Sharp, it should be a superb game
with the result going any way.
Nearest tube: Arsenal.
West Ham Utd vs Newcastle Utd
(Division 1)
Saturday December 19, Upton Park
A game between two sides in the
middle of the league. West H a m ,
always renouned as an exciting,
attacking side, had a bad start to the
season but under loyal manager John
Lyall and thrilling skills of Kevin
Keen, Paul Ince and Tony Cottee,
things are improving. Newcastle are
playing some good football at the
moment with the Brazillian striker
Francisco Ernadi Lima da Silva
(known as Mirandinha) and ex-
Hammer Paul Goddard leading the
way. West Ham should win with the
close atmosphere and skills proving
the clinching factors.
Nearest tube: Upton Park.
Fulham vs Chesterfield (Division 3)
Saturday December 19,
Craven Cottage
A game not far away from Imperial
at the riverside ground of Craven
Cottage. With Fulham near the top
and Chesterfield near the bottom, plus
the stiking force of Gordon Davies
and Leroy Rosenior, Fulham should
win comfortably.
Nearest tube: Putney Bridge.
Charlton vs Chelsea (Division 1)
Sunday December 20, Selhurst Park
A London Derby between stuggling
Charlton and top half Chelsea.
Charlton, the side that only scraped
back into the First Division by means
of the play-offs are having a wretched
season, despite Welsh International
Andy Jones and ex-Spurs player
Garth Crooks. Chelsea, under John
Hollins are a good working side with
exciting Scot Pat Nevin and ex-
England striker Kerry D i x o n .
Chelsea, who gave Liverpool a good
run for their money two weeks ago,
should grab the 3 points.
Nearest station: Norwood Junction
(BR).
So go along to see some good football
this weekend before Christmas and
ignore the talk of hooliganism, it is
very rare and only for those who want
it.
