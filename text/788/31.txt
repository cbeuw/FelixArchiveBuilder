A Midsummer
Night's Dream
RSC, Barbican
As a Christmas show, A Midsummer
Night's Dream seems ideal:
Shakespearean culture for the adults
and lots of fairies for the children of
all ages, roughly 0 to 90. The RSC's
current production makes sure that
both aspects are well enjoyed.
The production takes us back
several decades and provides us with
a delightful visual spectacle, although
the time change is only relevant to the
humans, fairies being timeless
creatures as any Peter Pan devotee
will tell you.
The story concerns two sets of
lovers, only one pair of whom
actually returns their love. Poor
Helena loves Demetrius, who only
has eyes of Hermia, who is loved by
and loves Lysander. Kathryn Pogson
turns in a superb performance as
Helena, and her argument with
Hermia, re Lysander's sudden
infatuation with her, is undoubtedly
one of the best staged moments of the
play. A l l the sudden changes in
peoples' infatuation, are caused by
Puck, aide to Oberon king of the
THEA WE
fairies, who goes around putting
magic potion into the eyes of all the
wrong people. M r Woodeson is
assured and witty as Puck and his
obvious acting ability does wonders
with what are already wonderful
lines. A s a sidekick to Oberon he is
perfect and a complete opposite to the
somewhat harsh portrayal of Oberon
by Gerard Murphy.
Whilst the fairies are on the whole
light of foot and delightfully quick,
Oberon's dance with his queen
Titania, looked sadly out of place and
both M r Murphy and M s Tomelty
(Titania) looked surprisingly
uncomfortable.
It is however for the great
performance of the whole that it will
be remembered and it is a
considerable compliment to say that
very rarely does one think about the
age of the language or the fact that
much of it is written in rhyming
couplets.
So if you are bored with Tinkerbell,
let Puck do the entertaining this
Christmas.

Innerspace
A minaturised one-man submersible
is accidently injected into a
supermarket cashier, who thinks that
he's possessed. He then has to go on
a wild madcap chase to retrieve the
silicon chip needed to re-enlarge the
intruder. Foreign electronics buyers
and nasty industrialists complicate
matters.
This is the latest offering from
Steven Spielberg/Joe Dante, and has
the same problems/advantages of all
the others; fast moving plots with
holes through which you could drive
a double decker bus, moments of
hilarious screwball comedy, moments
of unutterable silliness. In other
words, great entertainment. And if the
plot sounds familiar, it's because the
film is a sort of remake of Fantastic
Voyage, with Racquel W e l c h .
Innerspace sports its own beauty:
Meg Ryan, last seen in Top Gun.

Our Village
Mary Russell Mitford
Miss Mitford introduces the reader to
a record of village life in the first half
of the nineteenth century. Our Village
is a collection of sketches of rural
character and scenery that includes
such topics as a country cricket
match, various character studies of
neighbours and descriptions of
country walks throughout the year.
Not just a charming period piece, or
even a social history, but the
memories and reflections of a warm
and resilient woman.

The Official Doctor's
Joke Book
by Larry Wilde
I am not sure which body authorised
this book as official, except that it
certainly was not the British Medical
Association. The book is an import
from the States, with the only
alteration for the English edition being
the price on the cover. On the inside
is American spelling, American
language and American money, as
well as the most appalling American
humour at its very worst. Not a single
joke managed to produce a laugh, not
even from the doctor I tried a couple
out with. Don't bother considering
getting this book if you have a sense
of humour.

Allen Ginsberg-Collected
Poems 1987-1980
An extraordinary collection of poems
by an extraordinary man; Allen
Ginsberg is a man of many faces:
Jew, Buddhist, ancient sage, 'enfant
terrible', tragic dynamic, and his
poetry reflects this: readalouds,
incantations, drug-induced
hallucinations and tender, explicit'
love poems. This book gives a unique
record of life lived at the raw end
during the last four decades in most
places you've always wanted to get
to or out of. Ginsberg is a major
American poet, a great influence in
the American political voice and a
lyrical genius.

Rewards and Fairies
by Rudyard Kipling
I will look forward this Christmas to
toasting me toes in front of a roaring
fire each evening and indulging
myself in K i p l i n g ' s delightful
continuation of Puck of Pook Hill,
Rewards and Fairies. If I am in luck
the mince pies will last long enough
to read a couple of the short stories,
but if not I shall have to content
myself with one of Kipling's classic
poems that are scattered through the
book.
The title and first appearance
suggest this is a child's book, but I
don't know any children who could
possibly appreciate the magic in
Kipling's writing. Definately for adult
stockings.
