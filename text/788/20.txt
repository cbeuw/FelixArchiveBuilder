F e a t u r e s
SPECIAL
Earlier this year a
General Meeting of
the University of
Exeter Guild of
Students
unanimously passed
a motion
condemning the fur
trade and created a
'fur free zone' in
their Union
Building. Lynx, the
only national
organisation
campaigning solely
to end the fur trade
in this country,
hailed this as a
marvelous example
to all other students
around Britain. So
will you be wearing
furs this Christmas?
Fur or
against?
Fur is very much a seasonal trade
with vast quantities of coats being sold
between November and February
each year. Fur pelts, whether wild or
farmed, become thick and glossy in
the late autumn and throughout
winter. It is during November that
farmed minks are killed and pelted.
Auction sales are held regularly from
mid-December through to June. Pelts
are auctioned in a 'raw' state: this is
where animals have usually been
electrocuted and then skinned but the
pelts have not been cleaned. The
season's first pelts are sent for
cleaning, dressing and dyeing from
March onwards. Fur pelts are
prepared in many ways. They are
scapped and thinned. Raw leather is
brittle and hard so the skins have to
be drummed to soften the leather and
then cleaned. Dressing is a lengthy
process and can take over a month to
complete. The major international fur
fairs, such as Frankfurt, Madrid and
Paris take place in March and April.
It is orders placed at these fairs which
are made up during the the summer
and which reach the shops in time for
the next winter.
Why do people wear fur coats?
With so many synthetic fibres which
are just as warm, just as waterproof
or just as comfortable, why do so
many people throughout the world
prefer wearing fur? The British Fur
Trade Association believe that it is
because people like the feel of fur and
the feeling of well-being it gives
them. They claim that many women
who do not own a fur coat say that
a fur coat would feature high on their
list of things that they would like to
own. Meanwhile Lynx are doing their
best to get rid of fur's glamourous
image. The most famous campaign
they have run in past years has been
'It takes up to 40 dumb animals to
make a fur coat...But only one to
wear it'. The impact of such
campaigns has been that the lower
range of the market, the rabbit skins
and lamb paw jackets, have not been
selling. I spoke to a furrier who said
that the mink and luxury furs market
was still strong but the cheap furs
which most young secretaries would
previously have bought and worn are
very hard to get rid of nowadays. It
seems that the campaign has only had
an effect on the young women where
fur is no longer fashionable in their
circles. Most fur is sold to middle-
aged women who still believe fur to
be glamourous as well as warm and
comfortable.
Why don't people wear fur coats?
The anti-fur lobby is growing rapidly
throughout Britain and a host of
celebrities are joining the band
wagon. In 1986 the first ever National
Anti-Fur Rally was held in Trafalgar
Square where thousands of Lynx
supporters gathered to hear speakers
from both the European and British
Parliaments. That same year a petition
calling for a ban on all world fur
imports from countries still using the
leghold trap was presented to No 10
Dowing Street by Clare Francis. It
contained nearly 200,000 signatures.
Most Lynx supporters do so
because they want to see inhumane
trapping banned. In an independent
opinion poll last year 74% of 2000
samples were against trapping and
70% against fur farming. They won't
wear fur because they are opposed to
imprisoning animals for a life time
and slaughtering them at a fraction of
their natural lifespans, when there are
alternatives available. 'But does the
anti-fur lobby eat meat or spread
ground bones on their vegetables or
feed offal to their pets?" The British
Fur Trade Association argues. It
points to the campaigners' double
standards; at the protesters who wear
leather shoes and eat chicken
sandwiches. Not even vegans seem to
be able to explain away the millions
of rats, mice and rabbits that have to
be killed throughout the world in
order that they can enjoy their vegan
diets.
Some campaigners have become
animal terrorists, tired of the lack of
results that Lynx provide. Bands of
protesters have sent threats to fur
traders, bombed fur stores and let free
thousands of animals from British
mink farms. The fur trade made great
profit out of the fact that most of the
freed animals returned to the farms
in search of the continuous food
supply they were used to.
