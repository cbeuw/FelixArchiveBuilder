Buzzzzzzzzzzz
Dear Judith,
Here's something apolitical etc. I quite often use the
Lyon-Playfair Library (LPL). When I go there I expect
a quiet atmosphere and that's usually what libraries try
to maintain because it's helpful for studying, reading etc.
No, I'm not going to complain about student rioting in
the L P L but the silent hammering of the fluorescent
lighting circuits on my brain. The beat is too fast (3000
crotchets/minute) to be useful (eg hum along with). I don't
know how many other people find this unpleasant but I
do and if I am not alone in this perhaps L P L would do
something about it. Do L P L hear me?
Yourssssssss,
Neil Boxall (Elec Eng).
Objectionable
Dear Judith,
I write to protest about the objectionable tactics used,
by members of the Jewish Society in the last U G M , to
divert attention from a motion put forward by members
of the Friends of Palestine Society. The purpose of the
motion was to bring attention to an incident which took
place during a student protest in Bethlehem University.
The university is located in lands under Israeli military
occupation since 1967. During the protest, a student was
shot dead, in the head, by the Israeli army. A sniper rifle
was used. Before we could find what students of this
College think, before they were even informed about the
motion, a member of the Jewish Society put forward a
large number of what I can only describe as ridiculous
ammendments. The purpose was not to clarify but to
confuse. Before further discussion was allowed, a
procedural motion was brought forward to delay the
discussion until after the reports. This was against a
previous motion which put the motions first. At this point,
the very same members of the Jewish Society who later
claimed that they wanted the incident disussed and the truth
told to our students, voted to delay the discussion! M y
belief that they only wanted to keep the incident under
cover was further confirmed when the Chairperson of the
Jewish Society refused to sign a paper that called for an
E G M to discuss the motion.
I understand their position. They wrongly believe that
supporting Israel, right or wrong, protects the State and
is for the good of the Jewish people. I disagree. I would
vote for any motion which objects to human rights
violations in my country, because, in the long run, it is
for my country's own good. The delicate situation in the
Middle East can only be resolved if peace prevails and
this cannot be achieved as long as human rights are being
violated. They should help by informing people of the
facts, not by putting the lid on the whole affair. The build
up of pressure only leads to an explosion.
As for the false claim that the motion attacks Jews I
can only wonder, if protesting to the shooting of a student
through the head by an Israeli sniper is an attack on Jews,
how can the mother of the dead student protest? Would
they consider a polite letter to an Israeli army officer,
begging to spare the rest of her children, more appropriate?
If you think so, try to convince her!
j Yours sincerely,
' Amin El-Kholy (DOC 2).
' PS. Apathy played an important role, people decided that
| the motion was actually irrelevant before they could find
out what it was all about!
Survival at IC
Dear Judith,
Some months ago, several women postgraduates from
Imperial College attended a meeting entitled 'How to
Survive a PhD', run by a group called 'Women for Science
for Women' in Holborn. We would now like to suggest
a get-together for a drink and a chat here at IC. Any
woman working or studying in science or technology who
is interested in the position of women in science or how
technology can be used by and for women is invited to
the Holland Club (in the basement of the Sherfield
Building) on Thursday January 14 from 5.30pm onwards.
Undergraduates, postgraduates, technicians and academic
staff are all equally welcome.
If you want any more information, please contact A n n
on internal 6799.
Ann Heinson, High Energy Physics
and Mary Jennings, Dept of Humanities.

This is possibly one of the worst gimmicky letters I have
read and it was bloody difficult to reproduce so I won't
print any more like it.
It has come to the end of this term so I think it is time
that we put an end to pro- and anti-abortion letters.
I think everybody has had plenty of opportunity to state
their beliefs over the last eleven weeks and that no more
can usefully be said. Thank you.
