Puzzlerem
I know of a certain lecturer at
Imperial who, when he has too much
marking to do in one evening, will
reject most of the essays as being too
awful to merit a mark. He then gives
the remaining papers a mark from
zero to ten. He makes sure that the
first paper he marks is given the same
number of points as the number of
papers he gives zero to. (Did you get
that?) Likewise, the second paper he
marks gets the same number of points
as the number of papers he gives one
point to. A n d the third paper gets the
same number of points as the number
of papers which get two points, and
so on right down to the bottom of the
pile.
But this lecturer has been
discovered because he has been
forced to repeat himself this year and
he has graded a pile of papers with
the same marks as he has used before.
How many years has he been using
this marking scheme?
