Meeting on Thursday and are
confident that their motion will now
be fully debated.
The outcome, as always, will
depend on the number of interested
parties who turn up to vote.
The Constituent College Unions
have had their fair share of ups and
downs this term. The Mines image
had definately been on an upper since
Geoff Parsons took control. He
managed to persuade several
companies to give him money to refit
the Mines Coffee Room as a new
office. Poor old Royal College of
Science Union discovered the full
extent of their debts to College. They
had to find some way of paying back
around £6000. But their troubles
don't even compare to City &
Guild's. They have had to contend
with Dave Tyler as President. The
poor boy has delusions of grandeur
and doesn't see what's wrong with
threatening STOIC, flanning those
who do not wish to be flanned and
stealing 3000 copies of F E L I X from
their distribution points. A h , well, I
suppose it did raise an awful lot of
money for Rag...Only one good thing
has happened to C & G Union. The
voters got it right and elected Tanya
M a u l e , a first year chemical
engineering student as new Vice
President. M r Tyler also managed to
bring back the nastier side of inter-
C C U rivalry when the C & G mascotry
team tried to kidnap R C S U ' s mascot,
a large thermometer called Theta. He
was so miffed that R C S U got away
while he was trying to count them that
"The best thing to happen to Guilds"
he incited Guilds members to ruin two
R C S U freshers dinners.
It may have seemed that Ian
Howgate was an utter dickhead from
early reports in F E L I X but in
comparison to Dave Tyler he is
delightful. Reports from the Union
Office are that Ian's doing a good job
Well, at least one person was glad to see Howgate come back from Surrey
now and is a conscientious worker.
Shame about the Hon Sec, though.
There have been other notable
events this term. It was at the end of
October that 'heroic' Steve Pearson
of the I C U Boat Club rescued an
elderly woman from drowning in the
River Thames. The woman had been
found in the water near Fulham
football ground. It was believed that
she was trying to commit suicide. The
incident had occurred while members
of the Club were practising in coxless
fours. When Steve noticed her he
dived from the boat and pulled the
woman to the riverbank with another
oarsman, Vince Roper. Steve gave
the woman mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation while blankets were
brought and an ambulance was called.
The new Imperial School of
Management was also born amidst
petty politicing and outrage from the
Union's music societies when they
heard that they would lose their music
room in 53 Princes Gate. This led to
a petition being presented to the
Rector and a protest carol concert
being given yesterday. The Union,
initially confident that the room would
be safe, have since started looking for
alternatives.
College administration has had its
share of shake ups. Over summer,
Lesley Gillingham was removed as
Student Accommodation Officer,
after complaints from several
wardens. Managing Surveyor Peter
Hallworth said that letters had been
sent out late and that staff morale had
been low. He said his decision to
remove M s Gillingham had been a
hard one to make but that it had
'proved to be the right one'. Hapless
Michael Arthur, College Assistant
Secretary, took control until his
girlfriend Anna Jones could take over.
It was during this time that College
had to face a massive clear up in
Hamlet Gardens after residents had
wrecked the flats over the summer.
One group had even sold all the
furniture from their flat. A l l the
blankets had to be dry cleaned twice
and Manager Mark Cottle said 'if we
hadn't been there, there wouldn't be
any buildings left!'
The College housing situation has
looked glum for next year. It was
revealed that at least 50 more places
will be lost overall even though 180
places have been gained in Evelyn
Gardens. Housing benefit is also to
be cut in April 1988.
Despite all this doom, gloom and
depression things have been going
well for other spheres of the Union.
Rag looks like breaking all records
this year under the leadership of Nigel
Baker. The total now is almost as
much as was raised the whole of last
year. Rag Week went well with the
exception of drink-a-pub-dry. London
Student reported that 'Imperial louts'
had gone on a drunken rampage
through the University of London
Union Building, stealing signs and
generally being offensive. This news
story was very reminiscent of the one
F E L I X had carried earlier in the term,
reporting that IC sports team had been
accused of sexism, racism and
'riotous behaviour' while visiting
Surrey University. The whole
incident was resolved when Surrey
'kidnapped' Ian Howgate and gave
him a haircut. W e were told that
Surrey now realise why Imperial
males acted in such a fashion after
having to listen to non-stop Ian for
three days. It has to be noted that a
collection was held in December's
U G M . One tin, collecting to bring Ian
back, raised around £5. The other tin,
N e w s
collecting to ask Surrey to keep him,
raised £30. Unfortunately this was
nowhere near the £100 Surrey was
asking for so they sent him back.
The final major news story was that
the infamous French conman has
started operating in College again. He
has been conning foreign students for
over three years now. He always
claims to have lost all his money
gambling and that he needs to get
home urgently. He offers expensive
looking jewellery as security and
takes sums of around £1000 from
unsuspecting students.
The triumph of this term this year
has been College Entertainments who
finally seem to have a competent
Chairman and the 'right attitude'. We
saw 'Voice of the Beehive' perform
in Freshers Week who have since
made the charts with T Say Nothing'.
They also managed to get 'The Real
Sounds of Africa' who had been
featured on The South Bank Show
only a week earlier. This has given
the committee a problem; they have
too much money left!
This term has also been the term of
the condom. Did you spot the packet
on the picture cover? Not only did
FELLX shock its readers by revealing
how to put on a condom but the Union
Office, Snack Bar and Bar also started
selling Mates.
Finally, a little F E L I X anecdote. In
our Freshers Issue we carried a spoof
article about Prof E Verreday who
had invented A C batteries. This got
the trade press so excited that
Electronic Times rang College up to
get more details on the project!
Happy Christmas from us all.
