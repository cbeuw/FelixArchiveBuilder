Shooting at
International
With the Hungerford Massacre still
frighteningly fresh in the mind, the
nightmare of many International Hall
students were realised last Friday
when two students fired a round of
blanks and threw tomato ketchup
around during a crowded Christmas
party.
The shooting was carried out by a
fresher from SSEES using a German
8mm automatic pistol which had been
adapted to fire blanks. Eye witnesses
said that the student entered the Hall
bar during the Christmas party and
fired five times at a fellow student at
close range. This accomplice, a third
year, then threw copious amounts of
tomato ketchup at the victim to
complete the desired effect. However,
as panic struck the bar staff and
customers it was clear that the prank
had gone horrifically wrong. Within
seconds the police were on the scene
and they attempted to seal off the bar
at once but the assailants managed to
escape.
The following morning the Hall bar
manager Peter Storker who had
recognised the gunman, decided to
take legal action. The charges which
have not yet been disclosed are likely
to include illegal possession of a
firearm, assault and disturbing the
peace.
A great time was had by all when the superb Real Sounds of Africa
appeared in IC Union Lounge on Thursday 3rd December. The
performance included a mind-boggling contortionist and a witch doctor.
The band went down well in the packed Union Lounge so much so that
nobody could stand still and a large percentage of the audience got up
and danced on the stage at the end of the evening.
Protest concert
Members of the College music
societies held a protest carol concert
yesterday lunchtime in the upper
foyer of the Sherfield Building. The
Social, Cultural and Amusements
Board Chairman, Richard Squire,
said afterwards that he had organised
the concert to bring to the attention
of the staff the anger that members of
the music societies felt when they
discovered that they would be losing
the use of the Princes Gate Music
Room after Christmas. The room is
to be used by the new School of
Management which took over the
Princes Gate buildings in the summer.
M r Squire said that they had been
offered an alternative room in the Old
Holland Club; now part of the
Department of Computing which was
'fine up to a point'. He has written
a letter to the Rector stating his
objections to Terminal Room 4 being
used for music. In it he points out that
the sound quality is poor, that the
room will not be available at
lunchtime and that there is no room
for a piano and garage. He is also
worried that Professor Sayers, Head
of the Department of Computing, has
told him that permanent terminals will
be installed in the room in two years
time which will mean looking for a
new room again.
VC ofOU
hits out
Dr John Horlock, Vice Chancellor of
the Open Universtiy, has hit out at
post experience engineering training
in Britain. He believes that British
engineers are trailing behind their
European counterparts. In an address
at Heriot-Watt University he pointed
out that French and German engineers
have a statutory entitlement to study
leave to upgrade their skills.
The Engineering Council is
expected to announce plans for a
major post-experience training
initiative designed to involve every
engineer and technician in Britain.
Tashkent
trauma
The Soviet Union's Tashkent library
has expressed concern over the
number of archived materials which
are cut up or stolen. They believe that
it is not vandalism that's to blame, but
scholars who want to take away
materials to read up on for their
research projects. The reason that text
is taken is that only 1,000
photocopiers are produced every year
in the U S S R and that official
regulations specify that photocopiers
must be kept in a locked room which
may only be used by special
photocopying personnel!
Galluping
science
A Nationwide Gallup poll has
revealed that 81% of people asked
said that they believe the nation's
prosperity depends on science and
technology.
Awards
The Natural Environmental Research
Council is to suspend an award round
for university grants in 1988. It has
had to do this to meet a cash crisis due
to increases in salaries. It is also
planning to impose compulsory
redundancies to meet a target loss of
120 posts in the next academic year.
