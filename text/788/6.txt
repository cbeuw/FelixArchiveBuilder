This term seems to have been struck
down with a lack of anything
important happening to anyone. The
students have put down their banners
and picked up their text books. No
longer does F E L I X contain reports of
massive demonstrations, w e l l -
IC accommodation crisis looming'
attended discos and outraged students.
Although the 'life' has gone out of
university life, it still didn't stop
F E L I X reporting on the more interest
events going on around College.
The 'postgraduate' F E L I X ,
produced in August, carried the
headline 'Finance blunder drags IC
further into debt'. A n investigation
had been carried out by the Inland
Revenue and it was estimated that IC
would have to pay more than
£100,000 in unpaid tax. The problem
had arisen because administration had
failed to pay contributions for all their
casual workers. Since then prices
have gone up in bars and refectories
around College. The only bar that
seems to have resisted the increases
had been the Union Bar which
reduced the price of its canned soft
drinks by 2p to 30p.
This term has undoubtedly seen a
tightening of the purse strings all over
College. Week after week there has
been news of erosion in every
department. E v e n central
administration has had to face losses
and as the Sherfield Print Unit is
gradually being run down, more and
more College printing is being done
on the Union's Print Unit. Over
Summer the Rector announced that
the College would produce its own
paper for academic staff to be called
Network. The first issue hit the streets
on October 12th. Each member of
academic staff was wondering why
College was spending so much money
on a public relations exercise when
they had to lose technicians or
secretaries. The Rector defended
himself by saying that in the long term
Network would raise more money
than was ever spent on its production.
It was finally decided that Prof Ash's
'desk-top publishing baby' would be
typeset and printed by the Union to
reduce costs. This hasn't stopped
members of the C o l l e g e
administration calling it by its more
undignified F E L I X title, WetNerk.
But while the Union Print Unit was
enjoying the prospect of having more
work than it could print, everything
went wrong. Both the platemaker and
the printing presses decided that they
wanted a rest and went on strike. The
machines are now w o r k i n g

"The Constituent College Unions have had their ups and downs"

The College may be having
financial difficulties but the Union has
been dubbed 'one of the richest in
London' after it secured the income
from the sale of Harlington gravel for
students use. It is estimated that over
£3m will be raised over the next few
years which will probably be invested
by a committee set up by the College
and the Union to oversee financial
transactions.
The Union has become more
money-orientated over the past year.

job that he was all in favour of last
year's plan to set the sabbatical year
back to August—August from J u l y -
July. Nobody's too sure whether he'll
get his way because he hasn't brought
the plans up at a U G M yet.
Talking of U G M s : this term saw
the permanent adoption of the JCR as
home of the Union General Meeting.
A clear device aimed at making it look
like it's quorate even though it isn't.
There have been some interesting
debates at this term's U G M s . There
was the major issue of Postgraduate
Halls which inflamed Southside
residents when they heard that the
Union was not opposed to the
formation of a new P G hall in Selkirk
and Tizard—support was enough to
defer discussion from one U G M to
the next where a motion was passed
calling on the Union Executive to
oppose any formation of such a hall
in Southside. This doesn't mean that
there will be no new P G hall around
College, just that it will not be in
Southside.
The other contentious issue has
been that of Bethlehem University. A
clash of Friends of Palestine and
Jewish Society saw an aborted U G M
in early December when one
disgruntled member shouted quorum
after the motion was delayed by
procedure. The Friends have
managed to gain enough signatures to
call for an Extraordinary General
