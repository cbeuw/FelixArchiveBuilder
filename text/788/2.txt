Hasn't this term gone quickly? Surely
it was only yesterday that we were
producing the Freshers issue of
F E L I X . That issue was a thumping
36 pages but this one is even bigger
at 40 pages! This equals the record
number of F E L I X pages ever so don't
be surprised if the 1988 F E L I X s are
considerably smaller because we've
run out of money.
I think we've managed to get a nice
balance of the serious and not-so-
serious in this issue. I recommend that
you take the time to read the feature
about Bethlehem University. The
motion will be fully debated at
tomorrow's Extraordinary General
Meeting so you should be aware of
the 'facts' before you vote.
Bill Goodwin has interviewed
College band Stagefright who are
tipped by their friends to be the new
Queen. But do they have what it
takes? Are they pretty enough to make
it in today's pop world?
There are also features on the
Imperial College Union Boat Club,
the successful Karakoram expedition
over summer and the fur trade.
Congratulations to the person who
lives in 358 Falmouth Keogh Hall.
Whoever you are, you certainly
brightened up my weekend when I
looked up at your room from Princes ,
Gardens!
Holbein and F E L I X confidences
I have noticed over the past week that
feelings are running very high in
Holbein House this year. I had heard
that students in that house were very
active but it seems that a few have
been a bit too active. I did not see any
reason last week for cutting out a
small ad which read: *Fridges
wanted. Contact Bernard Sunley. But
the acting subwarden of Holbein did.
He came into the F E L I X Office last
Monday wanting to know who had
nut the ad in. It is my policy that only
smaii ads which have a name and
department on the back are published
but it is also my policy that I will not
let any third party know the names.
I told him that I would get in touch
with the person who placed the ad and
ask them to get in touch with him
instead. This I d i d . B u t M r
Subwarden was not satisfied with this
and went bleating to the Union
President that there should be a
censorship committee to censor small
ads. What tripe! If you were on a
censoring committee and you read
â€¢ Fridges wanted: Contact Bernard
Sunley, would you throw it out? O f
course not! Perhaps, its time to
remind everybody that F E L I X has
complete editorial freedom from the
Union and that if anybody has any
complaints they should come and see
me, not the Union President who has
no authority over F E L I X whatsoever.
It is also getting a little tiresome to
have people endlessly trouping into
the office telling me why I have to
include their article or do their
printing.
Conman
A student came into see me last week
suggesting that I should warn all
foreign students not to fall for the Air
France con which caught another
student two weeks ago. He described
how the conman had tried the same
con on him twice but that the police
can do little about the man until he
is caught in the act. Please do not
hand over large sums of cash to
anybody who you do not know that
comes to your door. The con is that
a man posing as an A i r France
steward claims that he has lost all his
money gambling and that he needs to
get home in a hurry. In return for cash
he offers 'gold' bracelets and watches
as security for the 'loan'. Don't be
duped.
The Free Gifts
We have three very different free gifts
for you in this issue: a copy of
Phoenix, the hologram on the cover
and an extra special one on page 5.
The hologram is a 2D-3D hologram
which is the type you will find on
your credit card. You will be able to
view it better if you use a spotlismt
such as a torch or anglepoise. We are
deeply in debted to Walter Clarke of
Global Images, U S A for providing
the holograms and Sunny Bains for
arranging the deal.
Your last chance
Today is your last chance to purchase
one o f our wonderful F E L I X
sweatshirts. This is possibly the last
batch of grey sweatshirts we will have
as the summer ones will be brighter
colours such as reds and yellows and
we only have a few of the present
ones left. A t a risk of repeating
myself, they do make excellent
Christmas presents and all my family
have got one.
And Anally
This is the last F E L I X of this term.
The next will appear on the first
Friday of next term. If you've ever
fancied writing for F E L I X then
there's no better time than the
Christmas holidays. Please hand all
contributions into me on the first
Monday.
We're having a Christmas party
this Friday lunchtime so bring a bottle
and join us!
