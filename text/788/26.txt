I wanna tell you a story
Now hear and attend and listen, best
beloveds, while your Uncle Andy
tells you the saddest tale ever written.
It is the tale of five thousand unhappy
children and all their wicked Uncles
and Aunts.
Once upon a time there were five
thousand children, who went to a big,
big school in a place called London.
Every morning of the week, the
children got up at about 8am feeling
miserable. When they had cleaned
their teeth, for most of them were
good little children, best beloveds,
they would walk out of their damp
little houses carrying such an awful
lot of books and paper, and wend their
ways to the big school, still feeling
miserable because they really didn't
like the big, big school they had to
go to.
The big school was ruled over by
all the little childrens' Uncles and
Aunts. Some of them were quite nice,
although they were all a bit old, best
beloveds, but some of them were so
nasty that you will have bad dreams
about them, just like the little children
did. The ones who were really nasty
had forgotten how to laugh a long
time ago, and had spent such a long
time being rude to little children that
they couldn't remember how to be
any other way. Most of them were all
shrivelled and dried up, so that they
looked just like dried plums, and were
just as sour.
The wicked Uncles and Aunts had
to teach the little children all sorts of
difficult things. The little children
were quite willing to try their best,
but when they had first come to the
big, big school they had had such a
shock meeting the Uncles and Aunts,
who were all divided up into nasty
things like Course Coordinators and
Personal Tutors, that they had lost all
their enthusiasm, and the Uncles and
Aunts were such dry, dead people that
even when they said something
interesting the children just sighed and
felt sad.
But listen carefully, best beloveds,
for the very worst thing was this:
When some of the little children who
had just got to the big school went to
see their personal Aunts and Uncles
to tell them how unhappy they were,
the wicked grown-ups wouldn't help
at all! They only told the poor
children to work harder than ever,
which was just the problem in the first
place. It wasn't that the Aunts and
Uncles were bad in the first place, but
they had been locked up in the big,
big school for such a long time that
they had forgotten what the world was
like, and besides, because of a very
wicked thing called Tenure, best
beloveds, they couldn't be got rid of
even if they were really awful, and
if all the children said so at once. So
all the little children had lost heart,
and never complained any more,
except to other little children.
My friends, despite the Rudyard
Kipling style, I ain't kidding. Many
people here do find life the most
appalling grind, and it shouldn't be
that way. It is mostly the result of the
dated and unsympathetic attitudes
displayed by many members of staff
who can't teach to save their lives,
and who have forgotten how to be
human. If you don't watch it, you
could end up like that.
It is not natural for people to be
middle aged in their attitudes at the
age of nineteen, and yet I reckon a
majority of undergraduates here fall
into that category. And you will too,
if you don't do something about it.
Rebel! Complain! Don't stand for
incompetence, don't roll with the
punches, don't let the bastards grind
you down. There are channels of
complaint, there are ways of making
your voice heard. If an entire lecture
group writes to the Rector
complaining about a particular
member of staff, things might happen.
Don't let them turn you into a
machine—behave like a student,
which means an intelligent young
person who has definite ideas and
who gets things done. Drag this
prehistoric institution screaming and
kicking into the twentieth century-
it C A N be done.

OPINION
In praise of...
Praise may be out of
fashion, and dangerously
likely to worsen IC's
complacency about
teaching standards, but
still...Here's a bit of
encouragement for those
who, albeit with natural
advantages, are getting it
nearly right—the
Geology department.
It's well into the academic year and
once more voices are raised in
chorus—no, it's not more Christmas
carols, it's that ancient sport, 'Let's
slag off the lecturers'. Isn't it sad to
see so many people having such an
awful time for three years of their
lives? Boring courses, appalling
lecturers, no social life (?); in short,
IC has no redeeming features.
Can I really be the only person in
College enjoying my course? M y
opinion is that the lecturers in my
department are doing an amazing job
under extremely trying
circumstances.
I suppose the fact that I find my
subject enthralling (on a good day)
gives me a big advantage. But in my
department one does get the feeling
that at least one of College's boasts
is true—we are being kept up-to-date
on some of the latest research and
ideas in the subject. Where else would
you be told, 'Here's the latest idea on
this topic, but don't write it in your
exams because it hasn't been
published yet'? Where else do you get
sent off to a two-day meeting to hear
some of the biggest names in a
specific field presenting work that's
fairly obviously still being thought
out?
Besides all this, our lecturers
manage to project their enthusiasm for
their subject despite such provocation
as having a one-person audience for
three weeks running—due, I hasten to
add, to the students' nocturnal
lifestyle rather than to the quality of
the lecturing. It must help that classes
are small enough for students and
lecturers to at least recognise each
other, unlike other departments I've
heard described. Formality is at a
minimum, and most people seem to
feel that the lecturers are at least
approachable. Admittedly, it would
take a very hard-hearted person not
to thaw a bit at the sight of a
bedraggled student staggering from a
day out in the field. Also, with the
authorities keeping close tabs on who
spends the field trip hiding in the
village coffee-shop, it's difficult for
students to feel the department is
impersonal. The nasty comments,
when delivered, are all too personal.
This brings me to one complaint
that could be made—that we're being
spoon-fed. Yet by this stage we're
also doing large projects with only as
much supervision as we need—or ask
for. Parts of the course leave much
to be desired. Computing as taught to
first years, for example, was a
standing joke; that is, if you were one
of the lucky few who already knew
one end of the keyboard from the
other. Some of the lecturers at times
provided the classic cure for
insomnia, though listening to people
from other courses we seem to have
escaped lightly. And we do know that
our complaints have been heard and,
hopefully, acted on.
There are, of course, the usual
quota of students who never see their
personal tutors. Possibly many of
them have no wish to do so. And it's
quite likely the tutor won't be able to
help with coursework—specialisation
means that people often can't answer
with any authority questions on
anything outside their own small
field. Frustrating indeed, but at least
(if my tutor is anything to go by; and
again, surely I'm not the only lucky
one) the tutors are there to reassure
and give the odd word of advice.
Summing up is easy: I find my
course fantastic fun (though you
wouldn't guess it from the amount of
work I do—charitably described as
minimal) and if this is mainly because
I love the subject, the lecturers in this
department have at least helped show
it off at its most fascinating and
challenging.
