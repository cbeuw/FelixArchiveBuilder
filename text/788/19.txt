South Kensington, promising to
return during termtime to see the Club
in action.
So it was in mid-November that I
finally found time to revisit the Club.
We had agreed to meet on Saturday
at 8.30am but I caught the wrong bus
and arrived five minutes late. So I
took advantage of the early morning
sun and settled down to watch the
other clubs on that stretch of the
River. A n hour and three-quarters
later the IC oarsmen returned from
upriver. The top teams had been
racing in eights in preparation for a
race the next weekend. When they
had put the boats safely inside the
Boathouse, I listened into one of Bill's
pep talks, made arrangements to visit
the next day and bought a ticket for
their annual dinner which was to be
held that night.
The dinner was a pleasant affair:
the guest speaker was Minister for
Sport Colin Moynihan, a former
Olympic rower from Oxford and old
friend of Bill (who is fond of telling
the tale that he can remember Colin
mooning at university). College
Secretary John Smith and Assistant
Secretary Michael Arthur were also
present, along with U n i o n
representative Charles Jackson, to
receive framed displays of victorious
Boat Club teams as a token of their
gratitudeâ€”and, perhaps, as a non-too-
subtle hint that more cash was needed.
I met Ian Scutts, who is currently
Below Coach Bill Mason with a silver
platter presented to him by the Boat
Club members as a mark of
appreciationfor all the hard work he
has put into the club. From left to

the only top squad coxen. This is his
final year at Imperial and he revealed
that the Club is desperate for new
coxens to take his place when he
leaves. He originally joined the Club
wishing to become an oarsman but at
only 5ft 7in and a little over 8st he
was soon persuaded to become a
coxen. He told me that the coxen is
always the scapegoat when a race is
lost but the rowers get the glory when
a race is won. He certainly seemed
to be the butt of most of the jokes at
the dinner but this didn't stop him
from getting a large round of applause
when he collected his World Student
Games presentation oar.
Guy Pooley, who was one of the
team which won the Visitors Cup and
went to the Student Games, was also
seated at my table. He has since left
Imperial and gone to Cambridge and
it is confidently predicted that he will
stroke in this year's University Boat
Race.
With the Olympics in 1988, the
Club is sure that at least one member
will be selected to row for Great
Britain in Korea.
The next day I made sure that I
arrived in plenty of time before the
boats went out. It gave me an
opportunity to talk to some of the
rowers. I asked them why they chose
to spend every morning down on the
River. The replies they gave were
similar: everybody talked about the
group identity and the sense of
belonging they felt. They also
mentioned their enjoyment of winning
and being part of a successful club.
One person told me that he enjoyed
rowing because it was one of very few
sports where dedication and hard
training were enough to make you top
class. Another believed that Imperial
rowers were prepared to put so much
time into rowing and training because
they wanted to please Bill. They all
derive a child-like pleasure from
making Bill proud of them.
I asked one rower if he found it
difficult to have to do so much
training every day. He said that it was
quite the opposite: 'you just have to
train, even when you're on holiday,
otherwise you start to twitch.'
Bill had prepared a punishing
training schedule for the top squad.
He had decided that they would take
the smaller boats and keep to 26

strokes per minute. I followed in a
launch with the new coach who gave
them tips on technique and timed their
strokes. David Hudson demonstrated
just how easy it is to capsize a scull
when he got caught up with another
boat just before Hammersmith
Bridge. It was just as we were
beginning to make the return journey
that the heavens opened and we all got
drenched by cold, penetrating rain. I
was glad to get back to the shelter of
the Boathouse, although the rowers
didn't seem the least bit upset by the
downpour.
Bill came out to ask me how I had
enjoyed the trip down the river. T
thought it was great until it started to
rain'. 'They all enjoy it until they get
wet', he quipped to a friend. I decided
io make a prompt exit in search of a
riot cup of coffee and some warm
clothes.
