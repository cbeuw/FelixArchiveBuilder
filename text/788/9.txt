Hi kiddies! What a week-and-a-half
it has been! Fulfilling my duties as
non-apathetic I've been getting
invovled in student politics, more of
this later. It is of course the Christmas
season and the major selling present
is the epitome of yuppiedom, the
Trivial Pursuit set, and so in an
attempt to hop on the bandwagon, I
present:
D R I V E L P U R S U I T Y
Literature
Why does Ian Howgate write his own
ransom notes?
I k i d you not. M r Howgate
composed, wrote and typed his own
ransom note (all except the PPS to
whit 'why is he fighting off the
women?'. Is our poor overworked
president so underpaid that he must
moonlight as a Surrey University
secretary? I mean, I know for a fact
this man can't even spell turd.
Television
Why is Dave Tyler so worried about
STOIC's 'illegal' showings of videos ?
I don't wish to claim he has a grudge
against STOIC, but he was very
anxious about it at Council. I thought
the man took a lax view of the in's
and out's of video law, especially
when I hear rumours about a certain
Swedish video in Canterbury.
Spelling
Why can't people print what I write?
I am of c**rse ref*rr*ng to the
ins*rt*on of ast*r*sks when I write
the word fuck, I mean fuck not f**k
because I am referring to the slang
term to copulate in one of its plethora
of metaphorical usages not Falmouth
Keogh Hall. (Censor that if you can
Judith.)
Politics
What is a camel?
A horse designed by a committee. A n
old joke, as opposed to 'what is IC?
A university run by a committee'. A s
I said I was at this Union Committee
meeting the other day. Procedure at
this meeting is thus: First receive 25
sheets of paper, second someone will
pick a random piece of paper, third,
while you're looking for your copy,
they will ask if you have any
questions or complaints, fourth they
will then proceed to the next piece of
paper just when you find the previous
one. Note: between steps three and
four you have voted—still it's a
fantastic system for those who can
use/abuse it (Mr Baker, M r Tyler) so
like any good bureaucrats they can
make the process last three hours.
Fashion
Why will Chris Martin be wearing a
dress in the first week of next term?
This is Pub Board's industrial action
(personally I do it for fun). Also on
the protest agenda is a protest scarf
knitting (can I have a pink one?) and
a protest ski holiday. H o w come I
never get to find out about committees
like this one? Of course Geoff Parsons
is loathe to tell R S M about this
irresponsible action, I feel instead of
a ski holiday, time would be better
spent helping Geoff s training, it's
about time he took a running jump.
Food & Drink
Have I bought the mostfeared banana
split on campus?
Most people who know who I am
know that I bought Fiona Nicholas at
the C & G Slave Auction. It now turns
out that she wishes to transfer her
slave duties to a slave she bought. The
only slave I can remember her buying
is Nigel Baker who was about £15
cheaper. So I'm not certain this is
wholly on, therefore, as it is a Rag
matter, I intend to raise it with my
C C U VP—that is to say my Rag
Chairman...that is to say...
PS. Has anyone noticed how Alan
Rose is an anagram for 'anal sore'.
• WILL CHRIS MARTIN wear a
dress for the first week of next term
as part of the Pub Board strike? If so,
which one will he choose from his
extensive wardrobe?
Chris will undoubtedly want to look
his best as he plays his first card in
the Sabbatical Election Campaign,
hoping to steal a jump on the other
probable candidate for FELDC Editor,
Bill Goodwin.
And other sabbatical posts?
A l Birch has confirmed that he will
be running for Deputy President and
has started the old politicians' trick
of using babies for publicity. (A word
of advice, A l , you're meant to kiss
the baby—not sit on it!)
On the presidential scene, Nigel
Baker's efforts with Rag have done
his prospects the world of good and
I'm sure he wouldn't mind being
President when (if?) the first Imperial
College Student Charity Support
'mega event' takes place.
Other possibles include U G M
Chair Alastair Seymour and Guilds
Hon Sec Alan Hepper, although the
latter may go for I C U Hon Sec just
to get into the Union Office.
• W I L L IT BE 'BYE-BYE C H A S '
at the start of next term?
Last Monday Council members
were again presented with the papers
only minutes before the meeting,
prompting Ian Howgate to propose a
motion that unless Hon Sec Chas
Jackson duplicates any reports given
to him at least a week in advance and
distributes them at least four College
days before Council then Chas will
tender his resignation.
A case of Chas jumping before
Judith pushes him?
• WHO'S A SHY bunch of students
then?
Sales of Mates condoms i n
Norman's, the Union Snack Bar, have
hardly set the cash tills ringing, only
four packets having been sold since
they went on sale a few weeks ago.
And talking of condoms, why is
there a packet of Red Stripe hidden
away somewhere in the F E L I X
Office?
• CHAS 'A NOD'S as good as a
wink' Brereton never seems to give
up. Having had his eye on a certain
young female for some time, Chas
decided to try and strike it lucky
during the I C U burglary campaign.
The campaign involved members of
the Union visiting people in halls of
residence and leaving rude notes in
those rooms which had been left
unlocked and unattended. Sufficient
to say that Chas arranged to raid the
room of one particular female in
Weeks Hall. He emerged from the
room after a quarter of an hour
looking somewhat haggered. Who
was the girl in question? I'll keep that
under my hat but it'll cost Chas three
pints of G B H .
• SOME OF YOU avid small ads
readers may have wondered why
there are two nancy boys in Science
Fiction Society. Well I can now shed
some light on the unpleasant affair.
Simon Bradshaw, SFSoc Publicity
Officer, is going out with a Nancy.
Dave Clements, SFSoc Bod & Social
Clubs Committee Chairman, is also
going out with a Nancy. It seems that
the whole College knows that these
two 'Nancy's are one and the same
except for Simon and Dave. Sorry
boys!
• IC RADIO, that bastion of fine
moral values, is in turmoil once more.
There's the 'caring' faction and the
'non-caring' faction. But there have
always been at least two factions
down the station at any one time. The
'caring' faction used to be in the
majority but now only contains three
members my mole told me. Well, we
in the F E L I X Office have noticed a
distinct lack on IC Radio this term.
So have the Union Snack Bar who are
so sick and tired of listening to
MasterTrax that they've decided to do
away with their IC Radio line in
favour of their own music next term
