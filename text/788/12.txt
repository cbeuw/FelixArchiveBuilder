Under the mistletoe?
There is no news on this page this
week: Christmas is a time for
goodwill to all people, and
contemplating the news is not
compatible with such a state of mind.
So I thought it would be appropriate
to fill the space with something more
lighthearted than normal. I have even
decided to set some competitions for
those of you who will not spend the
whole of Christmas out of your
minds. The cartoons are from a well
known science magazine.
What scientists want
for Christmas
Last year New Scientist asked some
famous scientists what they were
asking Father Christmas for. Some of
the answers are worth repeating.
Professor Igor Aleksander, of
Imperial College, wanted a full
emulation of the human brain in
silicon chips. I would be inclined to
dismiss this as arrogant, if he hadn't
also said that he wanted it so people
would no longer have to stick wires
in animals' heads to find out how
brains work.
Roy Gibson, the former director of
the British National Space Centre,
decided to give Santa some advice.
He thought that the reindeer-powered
sledge was a bit primitive, and that
the whole operation should move onto
Hotol, the proposed European
reusable space plane. Unfortunately,
the Government has decided that such
things are a waste of time, and Roy
Gibson has consequently resigned.
Brian Oakely, then director of the
Alvey programme, wanted everyone
to be made to study both arts and
sciences until the end of their first
year at university. This is a good idea,
not so much because scientists will be
able to write their PhD's in Latin, but
because the people who run the
country might then remember what
science actually is. Most of them are
arts graduates at the moment, and all
they know about science is that it costs
money and ought to be abolished.
What I want for Christmas is an
advertising eliminator. This device
will make a fortune for its inventor.
It will shield the wearer from all
forms of advertising, such as the
incessant Curry's Motors ads on
Capital Radio. The device will plug
the users ears and darken his glasses
whenever an advert is detected. A lot
of us will be very grateful.
Angel Gabriel cited
in surrogate
parenthood case
One of the little competitions set by
New Scientist in past festive seasons
has been to think up plausable
scientific news headlines. The above
headline (recently unearthed by
archaeologists) is from the science
page of the Jerusalem Weekly
Grapevine, sometime around 2 A D .
It is interesting to note that Gabriel
would now be liable for prosecution
under both the surrogate motherhood
laws and the proposed new laws on
experimentation on embryos.
Though, of course, the Bishop of
Durham wouldn't believe any of it.
Other notable headlines in the
history of science have been US
Surgeon Uses Barbed Electric
Endoscope: Shock horror probe and
Dr Fuchs Off to Antarctica. The
second one is real, D r Vivien Fuchs
was a famous polar explorer.
The
SciTech
Christmas
Special
However, neither of these is
seasonally topical. Your task, should
you choose to accept it, is to think up
seasonally topical scientific headlines.
Any good ones will be published in
F E L I X , and the best one may get a
substantial prize, if it's good enough.
New Year and
predicting the future
Apart from amusing themselves,
scientists also spend Christmas
speculating about the future. Not that
there is one for science in Britain, but
it keeps their minds occupied. Here
are some predictions, of what life
would be like in the 1980s, made by
scientists in Scientific American in the
early 1880s.
Chops and steaks will be cooked by
electric sparks...
Not b a d , but they missed
vegetarianism.
The fruits of the earth will be
multiplied enormously by the use of
electric light behind coloured glass...
O K , .no problems here, but they
failed to predict the fad for naturally
grown organic wholefood.
Air and water will be purified from
all germs of disease, while air will not
be breathed by human beings until it
has been cleared of all noxious
qualities...
So they got air-conditioning and
chlorination of the water supply right,
but they missed Legionaires Disease,
which breeds in air-conditioning, and
nitrate pollution of the water supply,
which is caused by intensive farming.
If food can be produced by
improved methods at less cost, then
the problem of poverty is solved...
Ah, at last, a complete cock up. We
can produce enough food to feed
everybody cheaply, in fact we pile it
high in warehouses and let it rot. But
we haven't solved the problem of
