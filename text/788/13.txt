poverty.
Science, after all, is like a Genie,
it gives you exactly what you ask for;
no more, no less. So we can now have
as much food as we want, but no
amount of science will ever tell us
how best to distribute it.
Predicting new science is easy:
predicting the social consequences of
that science is not. People may have
predicted television before it
happened, but how many predicted
that half the population would watch
Eastenders?
A Christmas Mindbendef
Here is a little something to keep you
thinking if your brains have not been
completely paralysed by Christmas
television. It concerns self-referential
sentences.
Self-referential sentences can be
great fun. Here are a few to give you
a feel for what I mean:
This sentence would be seven words
long if it were six words shorter.
If writers were bakers, this sentence
would be exactly a dozen words long.
If this sentence didn't exist, then
someone would have invented it.
If the subjunctive was no longer
used in English, then this sentence
would be grammatically correct.
Not all self-referential sentences are
as interesting as these, but it is this
type of self-reference that can give
you hours of Christmas fun. Try to
think up a few more. Perhaps the best
ones are the neurotic kind that give
advice but don't take it, such as:
Proper writing, and you've heard
this a million times, avoid
exaggeration.
Others are hard to classify:
This sentencefrom Shakespeare has
delusions of grandeur.
Thinking this sort of thing up is
better than playing with a Rubik's
cube. I thoroughly recommend it as
a cure for Christmas 'entertainment'
on television. But better than that, if
you can think up any really good
sentences, then you can get your name
in F E L I X , because I will print any
good ones I get. Those of you who
know the book I got this idea from
had better not try submitting any
unoriginal ones.
For those of you who waste your
valuable time playing with computers
here is a more serious challenge.
Produce another sentence like the
following one, that not only refers to
itself, but documents itself as well:
• This pangram tallies Jive a's, one
b, one c, two d's, twenty-eight e's,
eight f's, six g's, eight h's, thirteen
i's, one j, one k, three f's, two m's,
eighteen n's,fifteeno's, two p's, one
q, seven r's, twenty-five s's, twenty-
two t's, four u's, four v's, nine w's,
two x's, four y's and one z.
A pangram is a sentence that
contains all the letters of the alphabet.
Anyone who can think up an original
sentence of this form deserves a large
prize, even if they have to use a
computer to do it. I will personally
guarantee at least»ten pounds to
anyone who comes up with a better,
previously unpublished, self-
documenting sentence. There are no
restrictions on what language it is in.
I hope the effort keeps your brain
occupied this Christmas.
