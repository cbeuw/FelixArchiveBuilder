Academic Freedom Vs Licence to riot
Neville Nelkon, Chairman of the ICU Jewish Society, explains
why Bethlehem University was closed and describes the clashes
which led up to the shooting of Is'haq Abu Srur.
Before 1967 under Jordanian rule,
there was not a single university in
Judea-Samaria (recently coined the
West Bank). A l l the universities
operating today—there are now
5—were developed and accredited as
fully-fledged universities by Israel.
They include over 6000 students and
several hundred lecturers. These
universities are the most free in the
Middle East with the exception of
those in Israel itself. A s independent
institutions they enjoy:
1. Freedom to set syllabuses and
course content.
2. Freedom to employ Arab and
foreign academic staff.
3. Freedom to exist as independent
educational institutions.
4. Freedom to examine and criticise
government policies within normal
academic research standards.
5. Freedom to purchase all books
except the 350 included on the
censor's list.
6. Freedom to obtain funding from
any source excluding the P L O , but
including hostile Arab states.
7. Freedom to set entrance
standards and control entry to the
institution.
8. Students enjoy the freedom to
criticise government policies
peacefully.
Yet this is clearly insufficient for
a significant proportion of the students
as the universities have become the
vanguard for incitement, extremism
and terror. The situation is described
by Al-Kuds, a pro-Jordanian
newspaper on October 19th 1984:
'The roots of the recent crises are
the overwhelming political activities
on the campuses.. .causing the actual
academic activity to comprise less
than 1 % of the overall agenda on the
campuses.'
Dr Kna'ana, Acting President of
An-Najah, reinforces this view in the
PLO funded Al-Fajr.
'...the intentions of those who
supervised the establishment of the
educational institutions were not
really to foster education.. .rather they
viewed the establishment of these
institutions as helping their own
political ambitions or as advancing
their commercial interests.'
He goes on to make the pointed
remark:
'This chaos.. .has not been the result
of the absence o f national
sovereignty. Such deadly chaos has
not characterised every non-sovereign
society, especially not its higher
education.'
At the heart of the crisis is the
struggle between the internal
administrations of the various
institutions and the students on one
hand—and among P L O , leftist and
Moslem Brotherhood elements, on
the other—for control o f the
campuses. At Bethlehem University
in the wake of violent clashes between
leftists and Fatah supporters, in which
seven students were stabbed or
otherwise injured, the internal
administration closed the university
on November 23 1984 for three days.
On May 25 1985, in violent fights
among students from rival factions,
40 were wounded at B i r Zeit and
damage to the campus was estimated
at thousands of dollars. The university
administration closed the institution
for a month. Statistics kept by the
Adviser on Arab Affairs to the
Coordinator of Activities show that
the universities in these areas have
been closed for more days by the
university authorities themselves than
by the Israeli authorities.
Moreover, it is important to
recognise that the basis of the legal
system in this area is previous
Jordanian law and that Israel operates
under international law. This may be
summarised by the American guide
to the Laws of War on Land which
states:
'...that the occupying powers may
prevent any and all teaching which
serves to provoke hostility toward the
occupant's forces, disrespect to the
latter and their commands, or passive
resistance to the lawful orders given
to the civilian population.' It is against
this that Israel's policies must be
judged.
In 1979 a first year student at B i r
Zeit ran a Fatah terrorist cell which
killed 4 Israeli civilians. More
recently, the widely distributed 1986
PLO-Fatah calendar singles out for
special celebration the anniversaries
of the P L O massacre of the Israeli
athletes at Munich in 1972 and the
murder of school children in Maalot
in 1974.
Indeed, Israeli political policies can
be subject to legitimate discussion and
criticism. But such discussion is
irrelevant to the question o f
educational functioning and the
academic integrity of the West Bank
institutions. Academic freedom is not
to be equated with opportunity for
political incitement or underground
activity in the West Bank, or
anywhere else in the world.
St. Mary's
For the past week (Monday
November 30 to Friday December 4)
the student life here has been
dominated by the Musical A Funny
Thing Happened on the Way to the
Forum by Stephen Sondheim. This
work is best known through the long
standing association with Frankie
Howerd. This choice was made in a
hurry at the beginning of term but no
shortage of time was apparent in the
five performances on consecutive
nights.
The musical is set in Ancient
Rome, and this was quite believable
when the staging was revealed at the
start of the first act. The set consisted
of three houses, the centre one being
more imposing with a functional
balcony and fine pillars. A functional
fountain added to the scene well
complemented by thoughtful well
executed lighting.
The actors were of high standard,
each proficient in their roles. One
really should mention David Ketchin
(lst year) as Pseudolous, a part he
played with composure and elan.
Richard Keen as the dirty old man
Senex injected the correct amount of
depravity into a difficult part. The
voice of Borris Morrice, Hero, was
superb. The duet with Senex and
Hero I believe was the best song of
the production.
On a visual note the choreography
added to the event in that the dancing
scene when Pseudolous views the
females Marcus Lycus has to offer
produced the desired erotic effect.
Full marks for a nerve! The large set
routines were executed well as all
concerned clearly knew what to do,
so difficult in amateur productions.
The music itself was a little lacking,
not up to the standard of the other
facets.
In conclusion the performance was
extremely funny and if one had gone
to see it in the West End the only
difference would be the orchestra
quality. Indeed I have myself seen
worse productions in theatreland.
