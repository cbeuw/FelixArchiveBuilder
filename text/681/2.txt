ELETTERS
OUR
Not so
sorry state
Dear Sir,
Hugh Stiles ( F E L I X , Monday 1 October)
is to be admired for his concern regarding
certain aspects of the state of safety in his
Department. His letter records his opinions
and regardless of the accuracy and tone of his
letter's contents we should welcome any open
discourse on matters which affect the safety
of our places of work. They are, however, his
opinions and in fairness to those involved as
well as for the general appraisal of safety in
his Department and the college as a whole,
more needs to be said.
First, and of most importance, it is in the
Department's opinion that all of the
appropriate 'staff in Sherfield' have always
behaved in an entirely proper and
professional manner. They have been far
from indolent and indeed without their
vigorous assistance and monitoring the
standard of safety would be greatly reduced.
The second and final point of relevance in
the appraisal of the letter from High Stiles
concerns the nature of the two incidents
described. In both cases the offending
components were destroyed and the
surrounding evidence available to identify
the causes of failure is entirely circumstantial.
We have to admit that in cases such as this an
accurate identification of the reasons loi the
accident may never be established. There is
simply a physical limit to what can be done.
On these occasions all the possibilities air
explored and a considered appraisal of the
new hazard is made followed by the general
issue of new working procedures for stall and
students who are involved with hazards of
this type. This has been carried out for the
first incident and the results are on record. A
similar approach is currently being pursued
for the most recent case.
Our safety is a matter of continuing and
paramount concern and I wish to assure your
readers of this. The support and direction
provided by the Sherfield staff is a valuable
and indispensable contribution which
deserves to be more widely recognised.
Yours faithfully,
Brian J Briscoe
Departmental Safety Officer
Another
hazard
Dear Sir,
Since February the main entrance to the
old Chemistry building (RCS1) has been
locked in the evenings and at weekends
(although it is unlocked during College
hours). There is a small notice pinned to the
door (initialled by someone called C M W ,
whoever he is) stating that during the times
that the door is locked it can still be used as a
fire exit, despite the fact that it cannot be
opened from the inside without a key. I
wonder if the Departmental Superintendent
would like to explain how we are supposed to
get out through this door if the building
happens to be on fire.
Yours sincerely,
Howard Rudd
Chem PG
FELIX
Incompetence
Unforgivable
To those of you who are Freshers, this
institution must fill you with a certain sense
of awe.
There are large, glass and concrete
buildings towering above us, academics with
famous names, rectors with peerages and so
on.
But they all have one unity of purpose; they
are in your service, and without you they
would not be here.
Yet there are some parts of the great
institution which manifestly fail in theirduty.
And the one that has failed most frequently,
with most distress to students, and with most
crushing imcompetence, is the Refectory
Service.
To confuse beef and lamb is, you may
think, forgivable. The first time. But on the
second, third, fourth, fifth time it becomes,
by God, unforgivable.
And the story doesn't end there. This latest
error is symptomatic of a genera! disregard,
in the Refectories, for the proper service of
the students.
The responsibility must be laid fairly and
squarely at the feet of the Refectory Manager,
Mr Victor Mooney.
Mr Mooney has lost all interest in catering.
He divides his time between his extravagant
yacht in Southampton, and petty in-fighting
with members of the College Estates section.
When the College replaces M i Mooney
next year it must find someone oi rare insight
and skill to right the many wrongs that exist
in the refectories. We wish them iuck.
