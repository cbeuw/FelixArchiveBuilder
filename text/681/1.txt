Gross error
Southside refectory staff admitted on Wednesday that a
dish described as Saute of lamb in fact contained beef.
F E L I X was alerted when a
Hindu student allergic to beef
phoned the office anonymously.
F E L I X reporters then went to
Southside and ordered a portion
of 'Saute of Lamb'. The dish was
served, and the waitress replied
that it was lamb when asked
repeatedly.
The meal, costing 72 pence,
was brought back to the F E L I X
Office where it was examined and
found to contain large cubes of
stewing steak in a thick beef
sauce.
Southside Refectory Manager
David Smith investigated the
matter after enquires from the
F E L I X Office.
'A member of the kitchen staff
was responsible', he said.
'He removed the wrong dish
from the freezer, and thought
that it didn't matter'.
College Refectory Manager-
Victor Mooney said how sorry he
was and hoped that similar-
mistakes would not be made
again.
T've given instructions for the
chef to mark the dishes more
clearly before they are frozen', he
went on.
This incident follows a F E L I X
editorial in August this year
which said:
'...Mr Mooney's staff are
wrongly describing beef as
lamb...and so Hindus eating in
Southside are likely to have
committed what they would
regard as a grave sin'.
'It is intolerable that refectory
staff should make such crass
errors'.
Mr Mooney, who has been
incharge of the Refectories since
the early 1950s, is to leave the
College soon. His job was
advertised in The Times on
Tuesday.

Southside
flooded
Southside residents may have
pipes caused severe flooding
Residents first noticed water
coming into rooms on Staircases
five and eight, level three, on
Wednesday night at 6.00pm. On
Thursday morning at 8.25am
more severe flooding occurred
mainly in four Falmouth/Keogh
rooms, Selkirk gallery level, the
Housekeeper's Office and Tizard
kitchen.
Dirty water flowed into the
rooms through pipes running
along wardrobes. Residents
reported ruined clothing and hi-fi
equipment.
In one room water began to
flow through the electric light
fittings, fusing the system.
Electricians from Estates were
called to the scene to turn off
lighting current, and begin the
job of drying out fuse-boxes and
conduits.
to be evacuated after leaking
yesterday morning.
Consultants D S S R , who
designed the system, were
quickly on the scene to assess
damage and ascertain the cause
of the flood.
The flooding occurred when
Southside's newly installed
central heating system was filled
with water. The contractors,
Mort Scott, had failed to cap off
pipes to the old system.
Kate MacPherson house-
keeper in Selkirk, whose own
office was badly affected, said
that the long term problem
would be the stench from the
flooded rooms when they dried
out.
Damage to personal property,
carpets and paintwork has been
put at many thousands of
pounds.
More false alarms
Fire precautions in College have once again been shown to
be at fault. The problems with the new Southside fire alarm
system have still not been resolved with three false alarms
this week following the inconvenience and disruption caused
last term when the alarm continually went off, often in the
middle of the night.
Last year fire alarm system was
installed in the Southside Halls of
Residence. From the start it
proved to be unreliable with the
alarms going off regularly. As a
result the alarm became useless
since it weas soon ignored by
residents. F A C E , the consulting
company concerned with the
installation, visited the College
on several occasions during the
summer. However, false alarms
during the summer and on
Tuesday this week showed that
the problem had still not been
solved completely. Falmouth-
Keogh Hall warden Paul Jowitt
said that already new residents
were getting into the dangerous
habit of ignoring false alarms are
the result of some fundamental
flaws in the design of the system.
Smoke detectors, for example,
were installed in positions where
they were likely to detect smoke
from harmless sources such as
cookers and cigarettes. These are
now being replaced with heat
sensors which will hopefully only
be trigerred in real emergencies.
