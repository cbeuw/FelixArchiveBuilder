Rector slams pigs
The Rector, Lord Flowers, criticized male chauvinist pigs
within the College, in his speech to Freshers on Monday.
'They may consider themselves
fine fellows as they swagger to
their trough', he said, 'but the
rest of us merely pity them and
are happy to note that their
influence is on the wane'.
He urged any girl who feels
subjected to unacceptable
pressure to take her problem to
the Senior Tutor for women
students, M a r g a r e t C u n -
ningham.
In this welcoming address, the
Rector urged Freshers to work
hard but at the same time to
participate in Union activities.
'Few things can be less
democratic', he said, 'than the
apathy that leads you to leave
your opinion unregistered, and
allows others to exploit you'.
He went on to ask for
consideration for those living
near to the College, refering in
particular to the level of noise.
In a departure from his
prepared text, the Rector joked
The Rector
about the problems with the new
telephone systems reported in
Monday's F E L I X .
The reception ended with an
introduction to the Union by
President Ian Bull and other
Union Officers.

Officials pleased
Union officials are pleased
with the performance of the
new Union snack bar during
its first week of operation.
Despite some initial
problems, the quality of the
Food has been consistently
high and the demand has
been such that many of the
items on sale have sold out.
The menu has been praised by
many of the customers as being
interesting and varied. The most
poplar item is the quaterpounder
which sells for 60p. This consists
of a quality burger in a bap with
salad. Other items that have been
selling well i n c l u d e the
microwave dishes, such as pizzas,
tandoori cutlets and baked
potatos, and the salads.
On each day a queue built up
during lunchtime. However, by
Wednesday many of the serving
problems had been solved and
the students were being served
rapidly.
Snack bar staff stated that they
were delighted with the snack
bar's performance. They only
wished that people would make
more use of the snack bar at off
peak times in the morning and
afternoon when it serves the full
range of food.
