Careering
Along
'For about a week, I was looking at the
effects of lead pollution on inner city kids
and then I got involved in the fuss about
beer glasses, whether they should be
brim- or line- measured.' A B B C
Researcher describing his job?
'At the beginning, it was the amounts of
money that I was dealing with that most
horrified me but very quickly, I was
talking millions without batting an
eyelid.' A merchant banker describing
her job?
No, not a TV Researcher but a civil
servantand nota merchant bankerbut an
insurance analyst. These examples
introduce, ladies and gentlemen, one of
the greatest enemies to effective career
choice ... the S T E R E O T Y P E ...The
boring unimaginative civil servant, the
terrific excitement of all the travelling in
the Diplomatic Service, the man with the
bowler hat who sells imsurance at the
door, the careers adviser who doesn't
know anything about the real world!' It's
all nonsense, there are just as many
interesting lively civil servants as there
are boring unimaginative people in the
advertising industry but by bowing tothe
stereotypical image, we block out large
areas of employment and sources of
assistance.
On Tuesday, 9th October, speakers
from the Diplomatic and Administrative
Civil Service are visiting IC and on
Thursday, the Prudential Assurance
Company will be here. Why not turn up
and test your prejudices?
If you are still baffled by the G R P ,
confused by G O , G E T , D O G and
R O G E T . If you don't know how to start
choosing a career or just want to
bombard the Careers Service with
questions, Dr Neil Harris (who?) will be
talking on Wednesday 10th October.
