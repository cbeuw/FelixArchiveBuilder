Fire alarms
These recent faults with the
system highlight the safety
problems that have appeared in
recent months. Over the summer
the doors on the external fire exit
from the Southside lower gallery
level failed to open. A group of
American tourists who were
responding to a false alaram
found that the doors, which
should be released when the
alarm sounds, were still locked.
At the time of going to press Mr
Foggon, the College Fire Officer,
was still checking this incident.
Internal fire doors in Linstead
H a l l are also incorrectly
designed. Fire doors on the upper
gallery level can only open
through 90° rather than the 180°
required by law.
As present work is being
•carried out on the halls, aimed at
upgrading the fire alarm and
escape systems to the level
required to obtain a fire
certificated. It will be some
months before this work is
completed.
Union to oppose fare increases
Fare increases and cuts in
services on London Transport
are to be opposed by Imperial
College Union following a
motion passed at the Union
General Meeting yesterday. In
additon, the meeting was
addressed by Delyth Morgan,
President of the University of
London Union, and heard
reports from the President and
other Union Officers.
The motion on London
Transport noted the recent
change in control of LT and that
fare increases are expected. Any
future fare rises will affect
students more severely than past
increases because daily travelling
expenses can no longer be re-
claimed from Local Education
authorities. The motion pledged
the Union's support to 'Capital',
a n e w p r e s s u r e g r o u p
c a m p a i g n i n g against fare
increases.
The Returning Officer, Hon
Secretary Eric Darbyshire, gave
details of forthcoming elections.
The most important of them is
for the Rag Chairman, who is a
Union Officer and member of
Council. Also to be elected are
two first year representatives on
Council. Anyone interested in
standing requires the signature of
a proposer and ten seconders
who must all be Union members.
Nomination papers will be
posted on the noticeboard at the
foot of the central staircase in the
Union building on October 23.
Nominations will also be open
for several other positons on
U n i o n C o m m i t t e e s , wit h
elections held at the next U G M .
In addition, elections are to be
held in the Aeronautics, Mineral
Resources Engineering and
Management Science depart-
ments for d e p a r t m e n t a l
representatives. Reps in other
departments were elected last
session.
At the end of the meeting a
motion called 'Freedom Motion
1984' was proposed. This motion
was also put forward at each of
the Constituent College Union
meetings on Mondays, at all
three of which it was defeated or
not heard. The motion was
written by Michael Newman,
who took up much time at U G M s
last year with his anti-porn
compaign. Mr Newman is no
longer a student, having failed his
exams, and the motion was
proposed by John Martins.
Before M r Martins could speak
to the motion, however, a
procedural motion that the
question be not put was proposed
by Hugh Stiles. M r Stiles
attacked the proposers of the
motion for wasting time at
U G M s with irrelevant motions
all last year, and said that such'
motions should not be debated.
The procedural motion was
passed on the vote, and the
meeting closed with all business
complete shortly after 2.00pm.
