New Sexy Sabb Shock
The more aware reader may
remember in the not so distant past
that a set of sabbatical elections
were held. Three posts were
successfully filled, the Hon. Sec.
(Events) sadly was not, as you the
electorate were not happy with the
quality of the candidate. Which
means that at some point this
election has to be re-run and that
time is now.
Following a Council meeting on
Monday of this week it was decided
that the Union should employ a new
permanent member of staff, the
Events and Marketing Manager,
whose main areas of responsibility
will be providing quality events
around those that the Ents
Committee already provide and
publicising/marketing the Union
and its services to you the customer.
Furthermore he/she will be finding
out exactly what you want from
your Union and its services and how
to improve them.
This leaves the role of the Hon.
Sec virtually defunct and therefore
the whole raison d'etre of this
sabbatical post has been changed.
This post wil now be called 'Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies)' or
something like that and he/she will
be concentrating on servicing the
needs of all Union Clubs and
Societies (including all our athletic
interests) not only within the Union
but also via representation within
College. This area of Sabbatical
work is not devoted the time it
warrants at the moment and this
new post should plug this glaringly
large hole and relieve some of the
enormous pressures and workloads
that students involved in the
organisational side of our Clubs and
Athletic teams find themselves
under.
If you are interested in standing
for this post then go and see
Dominic in the Union who will be
more than happy to answer any of
your questions and give you a copy
of the outlined job description, as
it needs to be ratified in a further
meeting of Council.
This job comes with a
postgraduate grant, a free room in
hall for a year, an office of your
own and a never ending supply of
business cards.
The schedule for this election is
