'.. .to eyentually reach...' (drop 15ft

tempted to turn L too early as there
are cliffs below.' It seems Cliff
Craggs didn't make it.
Sella was the place to be: It
boasted a huge range of climbs for
all abilities, all bolted on a selection
of crags, free camping amongst the
almond groves and settlements of
long hair Spanish climbers, and no
dodgy descent routes. We spent the
end of the tour here. Martin claimed
tides for both the hardest lead and
the greatest lob (although Sarah's
was more dynamic) but failed
dismally at the ongoing shorts
contest despite wearing two pairs at
the same time. Ian gained, hands
down, the most patient belayer
award for staying awake (just) as
Rob remained on a microscopic
ledge for 1 Vi hours (an
underestimation, no kidding!) as he
waited for the next iceage to erode
new holds.

Clambering
On April 1st, seven courageous
climbing freaks found themselves in
a brave new world of hot rock when
the plane from Gatwick, bound for
Wales, found that it could not
penetrate the dense low pressure
region focused on the Snowdonia
National Park. Contingency plans
took us to Alicante on the Costa
Blanca, and from there, in 'Bullet'
the hire car, we sped to Calpe, Rob
at the wheel.
GCSE Spanish phrases (T do not
eat school dinners because they are
horrible') and Jans humble Espanol
('Seven beers please') managed to
book us into a campsite for one
night.
Pilgrims to the volcanic rock
faces; disciples to Cliff Craggs,
author of 'Costa Blanca Climbs'
(our bible for the next ten days). We
first scaled the penon de Ilfach by
the South face taking the 'Via
Valencianos' route. Five pitches
(820ft) and 6 hours later we'd made
it to the summut, five hours after
the tourists who'd walked 'via the
path'. Julian, determined to win the
most hideous shorts competition,
caught malaria while he cooked
bolognaise that evening and doubled
his success for the most bitten legs.

Bivvying on gravel for a second
night prompted us to hire cheap
accommodation for a week, found
with ease at this time of year.
Although the caretaker wouldn't
permit prussiking attempts from the
balcony or the eyesore of the inside
of Rob's sleeping bag draped over
the verandah he made no comment
on the fact that Julian wore his
award-winning shorts in the pool
area, overlooked by other residents.
We climbed extensively, at gas
mark 5, shorter routes at Toix East
and West over the next few days
which had original names such as
'The Green Route' and 'Another
Green Route'. A l l the routes in the
The Guide were well protected with
bolts placed every couple of metres
(an essential part of a Spaniards
rack is a 'Black 'n' Decker rock
drill) and the rock gave good
friction. The only risk which
presented itself was falling on one
of Rob's 'teatowel' extenders.
Sarah renewed her status as an aid
climber on one horrendous slab.
On a second multipitch route up
the Pen6n de Ilfach by the N W
face, Martin came face to beak with
a nesting seagul, who, finding his
sunhat offensive, divebombed him.

We climbed in the Mascarat Gorge
the following day, despite creating
our own mountains of egg-fried rice
made interesting by the odd
molecule of meat, and the group
split the day after, one party
climbing at the Dalle D'Ola and the
other at Sella, an hours drive away
along hairpin bend roads.
One group of three spent a day
ascending the 1200ft Puig
Campana. Sunbaked and thirsty,
Andy delirious after expecting a
'relaxing day' (quote Rob) to
recover from Extreme climbing the
day before, we descended after ten
pitches by a trecherous route to
arrive (thanks only to the glow from
some luminous yellow Ron Hills)
at the pick-up (—a bar) at 9.30pm.
While some took a day off to buy
up the rock boot factory shop in
Alicante (and finding it shut
resorting to the golden beaches),
three others braved a 790ft, 7 pitch
route ('Via UPSA') up the South
side of the Barranco Del Mascarat.
Again, a trecherous descent route:
'Traverse the narrow ridge...' (a
kmfe edge)'.. .follow the terrace...'
(what terrace?) '...climb the 15ft
wall (Diff) onto the open hillside...'
(Open? NOT! Lots of scree and
