Feature
14 May 1993
Over the Easter vacation, a team
from the Imperial College Yacht
Club mounted a concerted effort to
compete in and win the Spi
Dauphine '93.
The Spi Dauphine race series,
held over eight days, consists of five
races: two 99 nautical mile races
between Port Vendres in France
and Barcelona in Spain, two
Olympic triangle races, and an
event specially developed for the
Spi Dauphine, the 'Dolphin's
Dance', a 24 hour relay. Although
down somewhat in numbers this
year, with only 66 boats in
attendance compared with the
previous year's 110, the Spi
nevertheless was as exciting, and as
it turned out, as dangerous as it
always is.
Despite six months of fruitless
sponsorship-hunting, and despite
costs in the order of £10,000, the
IC team of 10, many of whom are
in their last year at college, was
determined to compete. With help
from the Marketing Department,
Sir Eric Ash the rector, Prof John
Archer the pro-rector, Angus
Fraser, and a very generous loan
from the Old Centralians Trust
Fund, the crew members Justin
Alexander, Thor Askeland, Rick
Bilby, Matt Crossman, Maria
Moratis, Thomas Muller,
Emmanuel Omont, Tim Parsons,
Nils Rasmilovic, and Marcus
Schmitt, each signed up for £600 of
debt to allow the best possible boat
to be hired and to ensure that the
team had the utmost opportunity to
excell in the race series. Marcus
Schmitt also personally committed
£2,500 as a deposit to secure our
booking of the high-performance
Jeanneau One-Design boat that we
rented, and his father printed team
t-shirts and rugby jumpers for the
whole crew and shipped them over
from Hong-Kong in time for the
race. With Marcus' leadership and
vision right at the outset, we
managed to avoid almost all the
reefs and snags that usually
accumulate to make such projects
as the Spi Dauphine impossible.
In addition to all the above, a
crew support team also invested
time and money in the series. The
team in Port Vendres consisted of
Liz Carr and Lynda Davies, who
were absolutely crucial for crew
morale and spirit towards the end
of the series, and Chris Moreton
who is doing his MEng placement
in Barcelona, took time off work to
pick up the pieces of wretched
humanity that arrived there after the
first race up from Port Vendres. We
hope we didn't drive his Spanish
flatmates, Christian and Marcus,
totally up the wall, they also gave
us tremendous hospitality.

Five of the crew arrived a week
before the event started, partly
because the boat had to be delivered
to Port Vendres for the start, and
partly for extra experience. The
race series began on Saturday 16th
April, 1993, and lasted until the
following Saturday. By the Friday
morning beforehand, the 15th
April, all ten members of the crew
had finally arrived, and in strong
winds, the boat had proved itself to
be a radical yet forgiving
performer, hitting 14.7 knots
surfing down a wave with only the
twice-reefed mainsail aloft.
The race fleet was divided into
company boats and student boats,
and having no sponsor, we were
designated as a company boat to
another yacht racing grandes
ecoles, Assas of Paris. Imperial-
Assas was our team, and there were
33 teams in all. Each race was run
with the two fleets, 33 yachts
apiece.
And so, on Saturday evening,
with a confused chop in the sea, a
stiff 25 knot Northerly, and an even
more confusing weather forecast,
we windward mark before turning,
popping the heavy spinnaker, and
surfing off South towards Barcelona
99 nautical miles away. As darkness
fell, the magnificent sight of the
fleet disappeared, to be replaced by
faint, swaying lights just above a
barely sensed horizon. We sailed on
with two or three other boats around
us. Screams of delight as waves
were caught and surfed were the
only reminders that there were other
people out here in the darkness.
Loneliness and fear did not occur
to us nor encroach on our excited
discussions of wind, sail trimming
navigation, and the opposition
yachts.
After five hours of rushing
downwind, at about 2.30am, we
passed the checkpoint in third
position. We were buzzed at how
well we had done, and were looking
forward to knocking off the other
boats in front of us. Suddenly,
however, the wind dropped
completely and we were becalmed.
For the next two hours, we drifted
into and out of Southerly puffs of
wind. The fleet that we had earlier
left far behind caught up with us and
the other leading yachts and were
becalmed in turn. Everything and
everybody was still. 'No
unnecessary movements please.'
We looked for wind. Tactical
decision time: sometimes there are
gusts at night which fall off the
land. We decide to go closer
towards the coast, and begin
moving from gust patch to gust
patch. This keeps us up with the
leading boats farther out to sea, and
although tired and cold, we feel
good. Dawn begins to break, and
suddenly we are in a dead patch. No
wind, Shivering, we wait for any
breeze to stir while the boats out to
sea begin to catch up and move
past. Uh ohhh.
Five hours later, after watching
almost the entire fleet sail past us
us while we lay in the hot morning
sun crying and weeping at black
fate, the wind finally stirred us on.
All day we tacked against the
Southerly breeze, until at last, at
7.30pm, we arrived at Barcelona,
15th out of the two fleets of boats,
and fully 24 hours after leaving Port
Vendres. Only the sight of Chris
Moreton waiting to greet us on the
dockside stopped some team
members from throwing themselves
into the filthy harbour in despair at
our pathetic result.
The next day was fresh and
sunny, and the second race, an
Olympic triangle event, was held.
The yachts had to race around a
short course as fast as possible. We
were all still disgusted with the
previous day's result, and a bloody-
minded determination began to
suffuse the whole team. The race
started very well for us, and from
that point on, we sailed perfectly.
Despite a long tussle with the big
beneateau from the Total team, we
won! First place! At last our Spi
Dauphine had truly started, and we
had won some respect for ourselves
and Imperial College! That night,
we totally forgot the first race and
celebrated!
But it wasn't forgotten for long.
The next morning at 8am, we
started the .next race, back to Port
Vendres! The pace of the races
began to feel a little punishing, but
once again we got a good start, and
set off with a gentle Southerly
behind us and the light spinnaker.
We sailed all day, tussling with the
other ten Jeanneau One-Designs.
Black clouds rolled up from behind,
and we all donned our wet-weather
gear in anticipation of some heavy
gusts. Finally they hit and we
burned forward on the waves,
surfing to 12.5 knots, but with
other, less careful boats, wiping out
and broaching badly beside us.
Spectacular stuff!
We rached the checkpoint 8 hours
after leaving Barcelona, and we
ducked in closer to the coast to pass
by the committee boat and show our
sail numbers. Then, moving back
out to sea, we hooked into some
stronger wind, and concentrated on
surfing the final 30 miles to Port
Vendres as fast as possible. Night
fell as a dolphin played alongside
our boat, and then we.
Nobody will forget the last five
miles. With the wind strengthening
and shifting to the East, and with
the light spinnaker still flying and

Spi Dauphine
threatening to explode, we shy
reached across the last big bay
towards Cape Bear, just around the
corner from Post Vendres.
Everybody was sitting at the back
of the boat, as far to leeward as they
could manage. Then, it was our turn
to wipe out, a sudden wave lifting
the rudder clear of the water and
causing us to totally lose control.
The spinnaker flapped madly as the
yacht crashed onto its side, dead in
the water. Slowly she righted
herself, the mast came up, the sails
snapped full with wind, and we shol
off again like a dinghy, hitting 12
knots in seconas. in tne next five
minutes, we wiped out four times
in the pitch darkness. Everybody
was calm however, totally in
control of durselves and
concentrating terrifically on every
moment of this last dash. By
pushing so hard, we slipped inside
four other boats, and when finally
we rounded the point and dropped
our spinnaker to cross the line, we
were in third place! Excellent! And
we had left Barcelona only 12 hours
and 30 minutes before! We danced
and laughed and drank pastice, and
though we were totally knackered,
we didn't feel a thing.
The following day, no events
were scheduled, and we all rested
gratefully. A quick two-hour sail
was all we could manage before we
settled back into our sombre mood,
contemplating the next race. The
breeze had settled down from the
previous night's strength, but all
day, nobody could forget our dash
down from Barcelona and the
excitement of the last five miles.
We were not in 8th place overall.
We wanted to do better...
Unsetded skies, choppy seas, and
a light to moderate Easterly breeze
awaited us at the start of the fourth
race, another triangle race. We got
another good start, and tacked up
to the windward mark easily
amongst the front boats, but
rounding the mark and heading
downwind, we realised that the light
spinnaker we hauled up had been
badly stretched and we took away
some stability. The other boats had
perhaps a quarter-knot speed
advantage downwind, and it was
enough to make us fall behind the
lead boats slightly. We caught up
again going upwind, but found it
impossible to overtake the first four
yachts. With a strange feeling of
anticlimax, we crossed the finish
line two hours after the start in 5th
place.
How would our position be
affected? How well had we done in
the overall stakes? We would have
to wait until the following day
before the new results would be
posted, but by then, the Dolphin's
Felix 966
Dance would be well underway...
The Dolphin's Dance. What a
diabolical invention. Not just a relay
race, but a 24 hour relay race. Each
team of two yachts, (in our case,
ourselves and Assas of Paris), had
24 hours to complete as many laps
as possible of a simple 12 mile long
'sausage-shaped' course. With the
wind at 30 knots gusting to 45, it
promised to be a very tough race,
and, we predicted that it would be
cancelled, or at least postponed.
It wasn't. The start occurred at
13.00 hours on the final day, and
Assas went first. We waited in port,
listening to the constant flow of
radio traffic and information,
listening for that fateful call:
'Froggies to Ros Biffs, Froggies
to Ros Biffs, 'arf and 'owahr to go!'
When it came, we scrambeld into
our yacht and shot out of the harbur,
heading towards the dual start-finish
line. We had to time our start so as
to cross the line as soon as our
team-mates crossed their finish line.
'There she is!' Assas' teak decks
identified her immediately as she
heeled over hard and tacked up to
the line. The committee boat blew
their horn as we crossed the line
together, waved, and then turned
and headed off downwind towards
the mark.
Suddenly, we were racing again.
The heavy spinnaker went up, and
immediately, the two-metre high
waves and strong winds took hold
of the boat. Conservative spinnaker
trimming and careful helming was
all that stopped us from wiping out
as we surfed on the waves, hitting
14.7 knots at one point. The bow
would disappear underwater as we
caught each wave, and fountains of
water poured back to hit the cockpit
before draining over the stern and
joining our motor-boat-like wake.
One wave caught us badly...'I've
lost it! Hang on everyone!', Thor
informed us calmly. Everyone was
so excited, we actually enjoyed the
wipeout, even though any gear
breakages would cost Us at least
£100 each. The spinnaker and rig
held though, and we snapped back
up to speed. We travelled six miles
in 28 minutes. Suddenly, the mark
was coming up really fast.
Dropping the spinnaker was
achieved with much swearing,
grunting, prayer, and desperation,
but finally, we rounded the mark
and began tacking up towards Port
Vendres. T would sell my mother
to do that again!' was the general
feeling on board.
An hour later, after tacking hard
up through the heavy swell, we
neared the finish line. The little
Jeanneau One-Design was
performing beautifully, and we
were proud of our performance.
Poor Assas, though, had hardly had
a half an hour of rest in the port
'eature
14 May 1993
before we neared the finish line and
called them back out. We passed on
another on the start-finish line
again, and relaxed a little making
it into port, with a feeling of
enervation suffusing everyone.
Still, there was at least another 21
hours to go. This race was not going
to be easy.
We rested for another hour, and
then the call from Assas came
again. This time, 'We are ten
minutes from the fineesh line!'
Hell's teeth!! We got out of Port
Vendres and had the sails up in
under four minutes, definitely a
record. Assas had underestimated
the time it was going to tack them,
though, luckily, and waited another
15 minutes before beginning our
run down to the mark once more.
In fact, the wind had lightened up
near the start-finish line, but
deviously, had strengthened by five
knots as one got closer to the mark.
Once again, we began to surf, no
less in control, but with the yacht
riding the knife edge between
surfing the wave and wiping out.
We slipped over to the other side
of that edge for a moment, and we
were gone again, roaring up into the
wind. This time, the yacht would
not come back around for nearly a
minute, before she snapped
viciously back into the wind. The
game was .over, and things were
getting serious. Several other yachts
that were returning to the start line
bore the scars of damage. Here a
ripped mainsail, there a yacht with
a broken boom, and there the last
piece of a torn spinnaker dangling
from the top of the mast like a badge
of valour.
As we rounded the mark and
tacked back up to the start-finish
line, we knew that someone was
going to realise that the conditions
were becoming too dangerous. If
we were finding the going tough
with our modern yacht, what would
happen to others who were sailing
much more venerable craft? Sure
enough, as soon as we called Assas
to tell them we were nearing the
line, we were told. Finish this lap,
and then everything is finished. We
were relieved, but a little sad too.
24 hours of that kind of sailing
would have killed us, but it would
have been an experience. At least
we had finished in the top ten teams
for the event. The Spi Dauphine '93
was over.
Final Results (out of 66 vessels):
1st race 15th (Port-Vendres to
Barcelona), 2nd race 1st (Triangle
of Barcelona), 3rd race 3rd
(Barcelona to Port-Vendres), 4th
race 5th (Triangle off Port-
Vendres), 5th race top ten
(Dolphin's Dance 24 hour relay).
Overall Result: Team 8th (with
Assas of Paris), Individual 5th (out
of 66 vessels).
