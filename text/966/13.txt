An exam depleted side made the
visit to Cobham under the captaincy
of Andy Jones. Having been
thoroughly woken up by Simon
Curwood's novel interpretation of
the Highway Code, IC set about
demoralising the Charing Cross
bowlers on a good wicket. Each
regular 1st XI batsman showed their
potential to make a big score,
although only Steve Blyth managed
to pass the magical 50 mark. A fine
closing effort of 44 by Mike
Forshaw enabled IC to reach 193
The Easter holidays saw Imperial
College Sailing Team compete in
the annual binge of sailing and
drinking BUSA—i.e. The British
Universities Sailing Association
Team Racing Chmapionships! For
the second year running this was
hosted by the University of London
Sailing Club at the Welsh Harp
Reservoir, North London, and ran
from the 5th-8th April.
After a last minute team change
due to a job interview, the revised
team of Liam Moloney, Ben
Deverson, Dave Spragg, Sinead
Malone, Melanie Hayles and
Richard Evans assembled at Team
H Q , Clayponds on Monday
evening.
The league racing started early on
Tuesday morning, 65 teams from
35 different universities in England,
Wales, Scotland and Ireland were
competing. The teams were divided
up into four mixed leagues of 12
each, and two ladies leagues of nine
each, the races were all sailed in
Larks and Laser 2's dinghies.
The squally and gusty weather on
Tuesday was far from ideal, with
survival sailing being the order of
the day and races won by the team
which managed to avoid capsize. IC
quickly won it's first two races
against Kent and Bangor making us
top of our league for a little while!
In complete contrast Wednesday
morning dawned almost windless
and racing did not start until
lunchtime. When racing did start
the going was immensely slow and
use of illegal propulsion methods
was rife!
The leagues were scheduled to
end on Wednesday but due to the
weather, on Wednesday evening at
7.30, there were still seven races to
be sailed. A n 8.30 start on
for 9.
Despite a strong start by Charing
Cross, once the breakthrough was
made, the few available bowlers
worked their way through the rest
of their batting order, and, backed
up by some great fielding
(particularly by a certain part of the
captain's anatomy), Charing Cross
were bowled out for 162.
IC 193-9 (Blyth 57, Forshaw 44)
(60 overs)
C C W 162 (Khan 4-42) (58 overs)
IC won by 31 runs
Thursday morning was proposed,
which after three hectic nights of
boozing, bopping and sharking is a
horrific hour to be climbing into a
damp and smelly sailing kit!
Fortunately the wind on Thursday
was near perfect for team racing.
After a 'performance enhancing'
chunder out of a boat by one team
member IC sailed their final two
races and the finals started. For
those teams not in the finals there
was a 'flat' race. Dave Spragg and
Sinead Malone entered for IC and
came a storming 6th out of 40 boats.
The University final was sailed
between Oxford and Southampton
and won by Southampton. The
Ladies competition was won by
Swansea. Regular readers of this
column may remember that
Swansea Ladies were the only team
IC beat at the 'London 6-Pack'
event in November!
Congratulations should also go to
Angus Cook and Robin
Mechlenbugh both at IC who sail
for the London first team who
reached the semi-finals.
Unfortunately this was the last
huge BUSA, next year there will be
regional qualifying leagues and a
26-32 team final, to quote the
BUSA '93 catchphrase 'C'est tout,
C'est fini, but after all size isn't
everything'!
Coleraine 24 hour Yacht Race.
Any club members interested in
going please contact Sinead or Ben
asap. We plan to leave London on
June 17th and return on the 21st.
Likely cost £40-£55 for travel and
entry.
Annual General Meeting 19th
May 1993, 12pm, Southside Upper
Lounge. All members are expected
to attend!
It's Oscar time at FilmSoc as we
proudly present A l Pacino in Scent
of a Woman, featuring a smnning
performance as a blind old soldier
Frank Slade which won Pacino the
Oscar for Best Actor at this year's
Academy Awards. Chris O'Donnell
plays student Charlie Simms, given
the job of looking after the retired
lieutenant colonel for the weekend,
in what turns out to be the education
of a lifetime, thanks to Slade.
Charlie has the biggest decision of
his life to think about, a decision
that could decide whether his life
will be a success or a failure, while
Slade decides his own life has gone
on too long and it's time he ended
it all. In a weekend filled with
action, drama, and fun, both learn
to get on with each other and solve
each other's problems. A l Pacino
proves he is worthy of his Oscar;
while totally blind, he manages to
disarm a threatening menace, dance
a mean tango with Gabrielle
Anwar, and even drive a sports car
at breakneck speed resulting in a
hilarious and memorable minor
police chase. A very convincing and
often moving portrayal, very
different from his earlier Godfather
roles.
Have a break from exams, and
don't miss the opportunity—Scent
of a Woman is not due on video for
some time, and besides, if you were
at Singles last week, you'll know
how awesome films are at FilmSoc
now that we show inthe Union
Concert Hall, with Da Vinci's bar
just downstairs. If you want, you
can still see this film at the Empire
on Leicester Square but it'll cost
you £8—at FilmSoc it's only £1.90
(90p for members) and our pre-film
light show is much better than
theirs. See you at 7.30pm next
Thursday. Next week: Costner and
Whitney! Apologies to anyone
expecting White Men Can't Jump
this week as well—unfortunately it
became unavailable.
