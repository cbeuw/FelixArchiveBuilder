Fantastic Fete

Twelve o'clock today saw the kick-
off of Rag's annual fete, complete
with jelly-slurping and wheelchair
racing, but sadly lacking the
notorious gunge- wrestling
(however, I don't think anybody
missed the Hit Squad and their
'orrible flans!). But Rag is not just
about playing silly games and
having fun - cheques for over
£10,000 were presented to this
year's nominated charities. A
serious business indeed! Falmouth
Keogh seemed pleased to finally get
their hands on the barrel of beer that
they've had their greedy little eyes
on all year, and collected so hard
for. Congratulations to them and all
the other Hall teams, the final totals
for the year are somewhere on this
page, honest.
Laserquest winner
Well done to Joe Baguley for being
the Lasersport winner (he's looking
over my shoulder as I write this, so
I daren't miss it out!). Various other
prizes were won, some of which are
still unclaimed: The cake and wine,
from the One Parent Families stall,
were won by Donogh O'Mahony,
from the Barton Lab in Old Chem;
Tom Nicholls won the first prize of
a t-shirt and beer in the Shelter
competition, with Helen " Teasdale
coming second and Susan Gokoll
third; Lynne Pink won a t-shirt
from Intermediate Technology;
lastly, Bill Quinton (yes, really)
won a 12 pack of beer from
Imperial Cancer Research Fund. A
mention must be made of the brave
musician, Ian, who attempted to
play his harmonica non-stop whilst
climbing to the top of Queens
Tower. He almost made it, too!
Finally, a big thanks to Jazz and
Rock Soc and the Chaplaincy for all
their help, and IC Radio (especially
Lofty!) for providing one hell of a
roadshow! Not to mention the
bands, for turning Queens Lawn
into a particularly pleasant place tr
be on Wednesday afternoon.
