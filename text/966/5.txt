Cover it up!
At last Summer is here. It's official!
The sun is shining, the sky is blue
and yet again the Queen's Lawn and
Beit Quad are peppered with
students exposing their bodies. Yes,
college has been invaded by white
flabby flesh and we have to look at
it.
The decline has been a steady
one. Two months ago the only
visible bits of skin were hands and
face. While not ideal, this was at
least acceptable. Then out popped
the sun and before we knew it, half
the student population had reached
for their shorts. Hairy, stubbly or
shaved, legs were everywhere. A l l
those sets of knobbly knees, all that
cellulite, it was enough to turn any
respectable person's stomach.
Now everyone's at it. Wandering
innocently across Beit Quad today,
minding my own business, my eyes
were assaulted by the sight of at
least four naked torsos. Shirts off
exposing hairy chests and smelly
armpits, what right do they think
they have!
And there's more. Believe it or
not a bikini-clad woman has been
spotted recently sunbathing next to
the Queen's Tower.
I can already hear the waves of
abuse at my attitude and views.
Why shouldn't we try to get a tan,
keep cool? Why should we be
ashamed of our bodies? To this I
answer: A R E W E M E N OR
ANIMALS. The effect of all this
nakedness and exhibitionism is
already making itself apparent. As
if the sight of other people's flesh
is not bad enough, the sight of two
scantily clad bodies entwined
together is. These full scale, public
displays of affection are abhorrent
to any decent person. Does anyone
out there really have any desire to
see two grown people eating each
other's face, or gazing lovingly into
each other's eyes while lying in
each other's arms. Of course not.
If we don't want to sink to the
standard of animals or, worse,
Rugby players, we have to clean
this college up, remove the source
of these animal urges before things
go to far. COVER U P THAT
F L A B NOW.
