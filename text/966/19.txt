Georgia O ' K e e f f e — A m e r i c a n
& M o d e r n
Saturday afternoon, sun shines.
Concrete looms around me as I
traverse the desolate wastelands of
the South Bank, seeking out culture
at the Hayward gallery. Inside, if
rumours are to be believed, are
some pictures of flowers by the
American Georgia O'Keeffe.
However, my true holy grail is the
work of the other featured artist,
James Turrell. Flyer, perceptual
psychologist and hollower-out of
extinct volcanoes, Turrell has
become renowned for creating
psychodramatic visual experiences
which have to be seen to be
believed. So, with a veritable
cluster of expectations, I bypassed
the flower paintings and leapt three
steps at a time up to the higher
reaches of the gallery. The first
room simply contains large spidery
aerial photographs of the extinct
volcano which Turrell is converting
to an 'unique observatory of the
heavens'. A few minutes glance at
these is enough and then it's on to
the constructions themselves. For
the first, ' A i r Mass', you head
Felix 966
through a wooden passage into a
large room. It's square, white
walled, with a square screen in the
ceiling. Suddenly you realise that
the screen is actually the sky, and
there's just a hole. The effect is
disconcerting at first but becomes
relaxing, meditative. The sky seems
close and two dimensional, like a
picture. There are seats where you
can watch it for a while, or just sun
yourself and read the brochure.
The story becomes bizarre at this
point. To see the other two exhibits
you have to queue until a guard
allows you in. 'Keep your hand on
the left wall', he says...Suddenly,
you're in darkness. You cannot see
a thing. You freak out with the
onset of claustrophobia, but don't
panic, just think yourself lucky;
previous installations have involved
swimming through underwater
passages or being hoisted on
platforms. You follow the wall
around a corner and enter
'Wedgework I V . This one is
STRANGE. A room, and a large
hole in the wall with red light. 'The
fires of hell', someone says. It can't
be described, you just have to see
it. Down through more darkness to
the final, and best, exhibit. This
room is dimly lit, with a window at
the end. But approach and you will

realise that it's not a window but an
opening inot a room, or something.
In fact, there's nothing. You stare,
and see mist, a void. No walls, no
darkness, just this space. Keep
staring and the mist closes around
you, you get sucked in. However
hard you search for some detail or
flaw you find none. It's very quiet,
frightening. You become calm as
your mind drifts...Don't watch for
too long or you'll never return.
That's what James Turrell does.
It can't really be described, but he
says about his work and philosophy,
'Light is not so much revealed, as
it is itself the revelation'.
The advertised artist, Georgia
O'Keeffe has been described as
America's most popular 20th
century artist. Throughout the
earlier part of this century she
devoted her time to painting
landscapes, bones and abstracts, but
is best remembered for her large
pictures of flowers. The exhibition
here shows the variety of her work
from early abstract sketches to
many of her later, more impressive
pieces. Many of her paintings have
a beautiful simplicity to them which
was inspired by oriental aesthetic
principles, and they are well worth
seeing i f you're interested.
However, the showing here was
dissatisfying in that, by
concentrating on the history and
development of her work, many of
the paintings shown are rather dull
compared to her best works. Still,
the tranquility in her paintings is a
good way of forgetting exam stress.
So, if you want a break from work
to spend an hour or two in a state
of visual meditation it's well worth
paying the extortionate entrance fee
to trip out at the Hayward gallery.

Seven children played by seven
adults; this play sounds a bit weird
and I was right to think so when I
discovered that the scribe was
Dennis Potter. But the
performances are so convincing that
I thought that the seven actors were
really children that were simply
oversized.
It is set in war time Britain, in the
west country. The male children are
obsessed by guns, war, knives,
violence etc, and surprisingly so are
the female children on a few
occasions! It starts out cheery
enough with the seven youngsters
playing various games. And then
the tragedy sets in towards the end
and the terror of the 'disaster' is
a youngster cries from Blue Remembered
very convincing and for a moment,
quite frightening.
All the characters were composed
of various child stereotypes that
have been used by other writers, but
Dennis Potter has managed to
present them in such a way that they
don't seem tired and worn out. Add
to this the brilliant production
presented by the theatre company
and you have a thoroughly
enjoyable play, but be Warned, the
authentic sounding country accents
can grate on your nerves after a
while.
