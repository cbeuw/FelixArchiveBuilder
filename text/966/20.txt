Iphigenia In Tauris
The Greek playwrites never were
known for their comedies so don't
expect to leave the theatre with sore
ribs. But don't expect to feel
suicidal neither, for it has a happy
ending (sort of).
Set in ancient Greece, this play
is a tale of separation and tragedy
among an unfortunate family, and
of the dominance of their lives as
decreed by the Gods. Iphigenia
(pronounced iffy-genia) was to be
sacrificed but was saved at the last
minute by one of the goddesses.
Other events too numerous to
mention occurred but eventually her
brother, who is unaware of her
existence, has to steal a statue of the
goddess from the temple that
Iphigenia was made high-priestess,
to escape the fury of the Furies.
Confused? Don't be. It is easier to
follow than you think.
It is very atmospheric and can be
depressing but still grips you from
start to finish.

A Dawn French lookalike in Lardo Weeping.
Lardo W e e p i n g
In Lardo Weeping we are
introduced to the world of Dinah
Lafarge an American woman
obsessed with food and desperately
strugglig to make a living by
sending her work to numerous
publishers.
Written and performed by Terry
Galloway, she was inspired to
create Dinah Lafarge 'by her sisters
who thought it would be fun to eat
themselves to death, by her mother
who knows the exact potassium
count of harf a banana and by her
father who is convinced that the
Reader's Digest clearing house
sweepstakes is his to win'.
Dinah's world is her tiny flat
which she rarely leaves. In the time
spent in her living room the
audience are made alarmingly
aware of society's attitudes to
Dinah's two greatest sins—being fat
and broke and also just how self-
destructive the mind's attitude can
be. Solely performed by Terry
Galloway, Largo Weeping is
bizarre, witty and very sad.

Homelessness is one of the major
issues of the 1990's yet is is seldom
tackled in the theatre. Often when
it is, it is as a peepshow glimpse into
a twilight world; grim, grey dramas
full of the pain of the underclass.
However Alan Gilbey's new play
challenges the normal dramatic
perceptions of homelessness and
delivers a wry, witty perspective of
life on the street. It manages to
convey the problems of
homelessness more bleakly than a
whole pamphlet of statistics and at
the same time it is good fun.
The play is a musical and all the
songs are those of Madness. You
may cringe, envisaging some stilted
contorted plot bent to fit around the
lyrics of the Nutty Boys. But the
whole play manages to stay within
the bounds of realism and many of
the audience were of the opinion
that Madness had written some of
the songs specifically for the play.
However those Madness
connoisseurs amongst you will
know that their lyrics mainly deal
with social problems, and those of
you who did not will be astounded
by the bizarre maturity of their
work (perhaps).
The characters are all homeless
and portray a range of 'types' of
homeless people (this may be
construed as cliched but since the
characters are given depth it works
well), there is an alcoholic beggar,
an old woman placed in the care of
the community (!), a young gay
man whose family chucked him out,
a girl who is trying to rebuild her
life (after a history of sex-abuse and
drug addiction) by selling the Big
The P i g e o n
Jonathan Noel, a tired security
guard escapes from his tortured
home to a second rate Parisian
hotel, where he, together with his
altered ego, relive his dark
encounter with 'a rat with wings'
the Pigeon which has shattered his
life. He escapes his life with an
intention to kill himself.
Is the pigeon only a metaphor for
his missed life? Jonathan is
revealing to us his life story, from
his childhood, war, disappearance
of mother, living on uncle's farm,
coming to Paris and starting a new
life. But what did this new life bring
to him? Fifty-five thousand hours
as a bank guard, with a stone face,
almost like Sphinx, no real friends,
no family. Everything that he has
is in his tiny, 6 foot square room,

Issue, and a yuppie who has lost his
house and family due to M r
Lamont's genius. The play revolves
around a plan to re-establish
homelessness as a media issue by
occupying the Ideal Home
Exhibition. The result is a gradual
decline into anarchy as the new
society the homeless have
established for themselves
degenerates. At this point the
audience has a collective feeling of
guilt about the problem of
homelessness and to hammer this
home the play ends with a chilling
ream of statistics, I don't need to
repeat them here you all know that
they are bad.
At the end of the play I was left
feeling that as members of society
it is our duty to accommodate the
homeless, and this means not just
protesting about better housing
provision, or giving people money
in the street, or buying the Big
Issue, it means treating the
homeless like people and listening
to what they have to say in order
to rekindle their faith in society.
On a lighter note I enjoyed the
play especially Jon Dawes rendition
of 'Night Boat to Cairo', the theatre
is nice and (unlike many theatres)
the bar remains open after the
performance.

with that terrible bird.
The Pigeon is at once a horrifying
and moving story of, fear,
destruction, loneliness, strong will,
missed life but at the same it is a
story of big achievements. It is
adapted from Patric Suskind's novel
by John Harvey. Performances
given by Barry Stanton as Jonathan
Noel and Henry Woolf as his
altered ego were excellent.
Although the story itself is a bit
bizarre, it makes you think,
question your life and your life
goals. And it is always better to do
that before it is too late, isn't it.

at the Moho Club. They also sell mint teas until the early hours and provide an interesting fruit cocktail
service too (see later spaces for details). Hey brother Crispin, long time no see! How's life in the space
