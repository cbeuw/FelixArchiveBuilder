Boat Club go Notts Cricket 1st v RHBNC
ICBC Report: Notts City Regatta
8th & 9th May
A screaming tailwind caused racing
to be postponed and then shortened
to 1000m on Saturday as IC crews
raced at the U A U championships.
The second eight dominated the
rough water and the field to win the
Senior 2 final whilst the women's
Junior four won their U A U
division, their senior counterparts
losing out to Durham by the
narrowest of margins in a tightly
fought race. Most encouraging was
the success of the U A U men's
eight, hoping to defend their Henley
Temple Cup title. A fast but not
exceptional time in winning their
heat saw them facing the threat of
all the main domestic opposition in
Oxford Poly, Bristol and Reading
Universities. A solid start saw them
just down on Oxford Poly in second
place at halfway but a concerted
push lifted the boat past the
leadings, to win by half a length and
recapture the U A U shield.
Henley champion Tefyn Beddoe
won a silver in the U A U single
sculls to complete the day's haul.
Racing on Sunday was cancelled.
ACC Elections

There are roughly two Exec and
two full A C C meetings a term and
your responsibility depends on the

IC 1st XI vs RHBNC 1st X I
IC entered the final game needing
yet another win to ensure
qualification to the knock-out stages
of the Commercial Union U A U
Competition with a 100% record,
despite never having been able to
field a full strength XI, and this was
duly achieved in our closest match
to date.
After an impressive start due to
a fine 44 from Simon Curwood,
who had just undergone an in depth
study of the 'Garry Sobers
technique', our middle order
wickets fell at regular intervals (as
usual) until we were rescued (as
usual) by our latest 'Celebrity Jack',
Ben Maxwell, whose swift 28 not
out in a superb unbeaten last wicket
stand of 37 with James Diss saw IC
to a respectable score of 184-9 in
our 60 overs, maintaining our
record of not once having been
bowled out this season.
We took to the field with an
inspiring team-talk from Jon
Mottashed and Daffyd Owen still
ringing in our ears, and fought back
after a loose start by taking three
quick wickets from some well held
catches, leaving Holloway at 58-3
at tea. Wickets continued to fall
regularly, and after a stubborn 7th
wicket partnership was broken in a
desperate attempt to increase the
run-rate in the face of some very
tight bowling from Jon Mottashed
in particular, the innings was
wrapped up for 158 in the 58th
over.
IC 1st X I 184-4 (Curwood 44,
Maxwell 28 n.o.) (60 overs)
RHBNC 158 (Mottashed 4-44,
Khan 4-86) (57.5 overs)
IC won by 26 runs
Cricket 1st win again
IC 1st vs Charing Cross 1st
An exam depleted side made the
visit to Cobham under the captaincy
of Andy Jones. Having been
thoroughly woken up by Simon
Curwood's novel interpretation of
the Highway Code, IC set about
demoralising the Charing Cross
bowlers on a good wicket. Each
regular 1st XI batsman showed their
potential to make a big score,
although only Steve Blyth managed
to pass the magical 50 mark. A fine
closing effort of 44 by Mike
Forshaw enabled IC to reach 193
for 9.
Despite a strong start by Charing
Cross, once the breakthrough was
made, the few available bowlers
worked their way through the rest
of their batting order, and, backed
up by some great fielding
(particularly by a certain part of the
captain's anatomy), Charing Cross
were bowled out for 162.
IC 193-9 (Blyth 57, Forshaw 44)
(60 overs)
CCW 162 (Khan 4-42) (58 overs)
IC won by 31 runs
