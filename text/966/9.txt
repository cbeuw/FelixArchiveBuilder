Death to the Travelcard!
Felix 966 14 May 1993
The coming months will see the end of London buses as we know them
Mimi Chakraborty examines the casualties on the deck.
For a Government apparently
unable to distingish between a
banana skin and a relatively
harmless bit of pavement, the
proposed deregulation of London's
bus service may prove another
opportunity to slip up.
Plans for deregulation were set
out in the Government consultation
document entitled ' A Bus Strategy
for London ' which was released in
March 1991. It came as part of the
last of a raft of privatisation
proposals which began with British
Telecom in the late eighties. Sadly,
unlike Vanessa Williams, they
neglected to leave the best till last,
and the privatisation initiatives
remaining - British Coal, British
Rail and The Royal Mail, have been
amongst the most contentious of any
proposed.
While Transport Secretary John
MacGregor has had his skills as a
magic-circle magician severely
tested in trying to make British Rail
chairman Sir Bob Reid completely
disappear, his deputy minister
Steven Norris has been trying to sell
bus deregulation with a similar lack
of success.
The plans have been opposed by
the Association of London
Authorities and the London
Borough's Association, the bodies
who currently have statutory
responsibility for the design and
implementation of traffic
management. They cite 'inevitable
chaos and confusion' and 'lack of
an integrated system of
concessionary fares' as their
principal criticisms.
Both of these have significant
implications for the would-be
commuter.
Simply explained the process of
deregulation will lift the statutory
constraint on London Transport to
provide a bus service in London and
opens the way for private
companies to compete for
whichever routes they choose. Once
the deregulation process is
underway the privatisation of
London's buses will follow. The
department of Transport plans to
complete both operations by the end
of the next parliamentary session.
The worst case scenario is of a
free-for-all between an unknown
number of bus companies
competing for the same customers
at the same bus-stops on the same
routes at the same time, clogging up
the city's networks for themselves
and other road traffic. While the
Government assures us that this will
not happen, precedents for
deregulation are not encouraging.
The West Midlands,
Wolverhampton, Sheffield,
Manchester and Oxford have all
deregulated their bus services with
relative degrees of success.
Significantly, fares have risen by a
third, services have been unreliable,
lower wage costs have reduced
operating costs but FEWER people
are using the buses.
Coordination between bus
services and other modes of
transport has reduced and co-
ordinated ticket-schemes have been
difficult to maintain.
In London, the effect of
deregulation which all sides are
agreed upon, is the ultimate demise
of the Travelcard. Currently around
eighty-three percent of London's
commuters use L R T to travel. Of
these only ten percent use only
buses. Many use a combination of
bus, tube, and British Rail for
which the fixed price Travelcard
and season tickets offer substantial
economies. There appears to be no
way of compelling competing
companies to involve themselves in
a through-ticketing system with
each other, so commuters may be
restricted by having to buy tickets
which would be valid for only on
company.
The government are considering
the introduction of an electronic
SMART card which can be valid
for more than one company, but this
will still have a cumulative charge-
per-journey, unlike the one-price
existing system.
Representatives of the
Association of London Authorities,
the London Regional Passenger
Committee and the London
Borough's association, told the all-
party Transport Select Committee
of their concerns. Also invited to
attend were representatives of the
Transport and General Worker's
Union, who expressed concern
about the pay and conditions of their
members after deregulation.
Transport Minister Stephen
Norris staunchly defended his
plans though, promising that
deregulation will 'help ensure that
the best bus is operated on the right
route.' At the end of a lengthy and
enthusiastic interview he was,
however, forced to concede that
there would be salary
' renegotiations', driver-number
'changes' and fare 'realisations'.
This probably means that there will
be cut-price party rates for
passengers, many more conductors
than it takes to change a lightbulb,
and a pay increase for operators in
line with currency speculators.
Perversely, however, the T G W U
elected to adopt just the kind of
gloomy view of proceedings which
has given the unions a bad name.
Whatever the success of one-day
bus strikes in the city, the
consultation period is drawing to a
close and expectations are that the
deregulation process will
commence in the spring. After
soliciting views from interested
parties the DoT will come to a
conclusion. In this context the word
'consultation' is elevated to almost
enigmatic status, but like the smile
of the Mona Lisa, it may mean
something, but then again it may
mean nothing at all.
In the last few moments of the
select committee's meeting a lone
voice amongst the MP's enquired
'What attempts have been made to
solicit passenger views ? ' Alas, it
seemed no-one had remembered to
ask.
