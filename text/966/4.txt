Ball is still on We must rebel!
Dear Jonty,
Dear Jonty,
We would just like to point out
that not all Summer Balls at IC have
fallen foul of the recession or
student apathy. This year's Life
Sciences Summer Ball is being held
at Silwood Park on Friday 21 May.
It will be slightly different from
usual as there will be a four course
meal and hypnotist show as well as
the usual live band, disco, bar, etc.
At the moment, tickets are
restricted to Biologists/Biochemists
and their guests. However, if we
have any tickets spare on 14 May,
we will make these available to
anyone in College. People wanting
tickets, which cost £22 each, should
'phone Ian Jones on ext 7503 (day)
or 8327 (eve).
Yours,
Ian Jones and Rian Picton.
Quickie
Dear Jonty
Will you please buy me?
Yours, a DTP system.
Dear Editor,
I was much distressed on Friday
May 7th when returning to College
for a day to discover that you have
either been forced by complete
apathy within the student masses to
scrub the letters' page or that you
have decided to silence the students'
voice in case it might stir up
trouble.
Things certainly seem to have
changed over the oast few years
since I left College. Not least of all
is the fact that the Felix Editor and
President appear to be friends. In
my day the Felix Editor was there
to make the President's life hell.
The Union President presents a
permanent restructuring of the
Union and the Editorial is two
columns of verbal diarrhoea and
one line stating that no one can
claim to represent the masses. I
assume this is a whimpering
Bastard has his say
Dear Jonty,
I'd like to set the record straight
regarding the entry- in last week's
'Cat's Eyes' (Felix 965).
I was quoted to have said that:
'Felix is a place for literary
types...', or something to that
effect, which, I must say, is not too
abstruse a statement (take Donny
O'Nonchalant for example!).
The ignoramus 'journalist' who
produced the article proceeded to
prove me completely wrong (and
indeed contradict himself) by
pathetically interpreting 'literary' as
meaning 'literacy' (why???).
Embarking on a deluge of abuse and
intolerable insolence, disparaging
the intellectual' stature and mental
acuity of my club's members.
I will not bother explaining the
difference between the two terms,
although the Station's dictionary
will be happy to oblige, should you
care to pay us a visit.
Why o'why o'why, did you see
fit to impropriate the column to such
an acne-ridden, social parasite?
I can see that no one would incur
to the drudgery, other than a
project. You ask 'so have all the
rebels gone? Has the urge to rebel
vanished?' Well it's yourjob to help
them come out of the woodwork.
You may feel that no one can
represent the masses but it is your
job to be their voice, the one person
who the College and the Union
cannot touch if they speak out.
Yours sincerely,
Sydney Harbour-Bridge,
Ex-President.
pretentious, malevolent cynic. But
I resent the writer and his style, and
I'm sure many people would agree
that perhaps a better title than 'Cat's
Eyes' would possibly be 'Dog's
Bollox'.
Yours,
The aggrieved Station Manager
(ostentatiously exhibiting
his.. .err.. .dictionary).

not sure about some of the spellings
in this—get Mr Spoons to proof it.
