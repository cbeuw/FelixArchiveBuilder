Reforms from page 1....
represent the Union on College
committees responsible for Clubs,
Societies and Athletics.
The posts of Welfare Chairman
and Postgraduate Chairman are
expected to evolve from the existing
posts of Welfare Officer and
Postgraduate Affairs Officer. The
new remit for Welfare Chairman
may overlap slightly with the job
description of Overseas Officer,
which will itself overlap with the
existing post of Chairman of the
Overseas Students' Committee
(OSC). A clear distinction is being
made, with the Overseas Officer
responsible for all overseas
students, irrespective of their
membership, if any, of Overseas
Students' Societies. The OSC
chairman will continue to represent
the members of Overseas Societies.
Senior sabbaticals regard the
survival of the post of OSC
Chairman as an indication of a very
active role for Union Major Sub-
committee chairmen 'for several
years'. It has been suggested,
though, that some responsibilities
held by officers like the OSC
Chairman could devolve to the
Deputy President (Clubs and
Societies). "This is a rationalisation
that might occur in future,' Felix
was told.
The new Entertainments Officer
will act as a co-ordinator between
the Chairman of the Social, Cultural
and Amusement Board, and the
Chairman of the Events Committee.
The new Entertainments Officer
post is not expected to replace either
of the existing jobs, but it has been
suggested that the two officers could
share the post of Entertainments
Officer.
The Communications Officer has
been branded by some Council
members as 'a press officer', ' M r
Davidson's Press Secretary', and
'Imperial's Bernard Ingham.' The
job description to be published next
Wednesday is expected to charge
the Communications Officer with
'finding out what the membership
wants' and liaising with the media.
'It will be a 50/50 split,' Felix has
been told. We understand that this
liaison will not extend to external
media; the President will retain
responsibility for external affairs,
but may refer enquiries to the
Communications Officer.
The Communications Officer
may also be charged with
organising welfare campaigns, such
as the 'previously successful' Aids
Awareness Week. As well as
agreeing to the establishment of this
post, last week's Council also
accepted that clubs and societies
Sherfield open house
will have to absorb a cut in their
budgets to pay for an increase in the
communications budget. 'Good,
effective communications cost
money,' Council was told by Chris
Davidson, ICU President.
Mr Davidson will publish his next
set of proposals on Wednesday, and
bring them to the next meeting of
Council the following week. The
President told Felix that only 'a
broad outline' had been produced
so far, and that the next document
would be 'more fleshy'. He added
his thanks to those who had worked
on the Working Party on Structure,
and also to Jim Glennon, his special
advisor.
As part of the overall Union
review, the Union media,
comprising Felix, IC Radio and
STOIC, are currently studying two
proposals to alter their funding and
editorial freedom. The Union is
suggesting that ICU will only fund
the media if they are accountable to
a Union General Meeting, and to
broad Union policy. This has been
described by Union figures as 'not
draconian control, but
responsibility'. The media is
studying a second proposals where
they receive no further funding
from the Union, but instead are
directly funded from College.
Either proposal would involve the
establishment of a College- based
'Press Complaints Commission'
(PCC) which would check negative
reporting, and which would enforce
sanctions for breach of College
Disciplinary codes. College
Management are believed to want
the existing Executive Committee
of the Governing Body to act as the
PCC.
Relations between the College
and the Union are also being
redefined as part of separate
reviews. A draft 'Heads of
Agreement' document has been
printed, and was submitted to
Council last Monday. The full text
of the document is printed inside
this week's Felix, on pages 10-11.
A guide to the text, written by Jonty
Beavan (22), Felix Editor, is printed
alongside.
A final version of the Heads of
Agreement will be presented to the
last Governing Body meeting of this
year in July. This meeting will also
discuss further moves to establish
the independence of Imperial
College within the University of
London. The University of London
will hold a Senate meeting on 7
June. There is speculation that one
of the parties may put a final
ultimatum on the table during this
meeting.

The Sherfield Senior Common
Room (SCR) will be thrown open
to students from this weekend.
Angus Fraser, College Managing
Director, says that the move is 'in
response to requests from students.'
The SCR is normally the preserve
of academic staff, providing a place
for relaxation, intellectual
discussion and gossip. It is also used
for the annual Pimlico
Connectidn/HUB 'Christmas
Caper', and for small meetings and
other functions. Mr Fraser says that
the SCR will provide 'a quiet area
for study at weekends.'
The SCR will be open from 10am
until 9.30pm on Saturday, and from
9am to 9.30pm on Sunday, until the
weekend of 19/20 June. The late
Saturday opening is due to cleaning
following functions on Friday
evenings. A previously-booked
external function on Saturday 12
June means that the SCR will be
closed to students on that day. The
opening time on the following
Sunday, 13 June, will be put back
until 10am because of this.
The Lyon Playfair-Haldane-
Science Museum library complex
will remain open at normal times on
Saturday throughout this period. Mr
Fraser notes that the opening of the
SCR at weekends will 'obviate the
need and expense of the library or
departments opening on Sunday.'
A coffee vending machine is
available in the SCR, unlike the
fully stocked but locked bar. A
chocolate machine is also on the
Sherfield foyer. Anyone wishing to
use the SCR must bring their
security swipecard.
Managed success for IC
by Felix reporters
The Imperial College community is
anxiously waiting this morning for
the overall results of the latest Times
Good University Guide.
Administrators, academics and
students are hoping to maintain or
better last October's national third
place ranking.
Preliminary results published in
the Times this week show Imperial
pulling slightly ahead of similar.
rankings last year. The
Management School entered the top
ten league for business and
management for the first time. At
position eight, it ties with last year's
seventh placed City University.
Greenwich and Kingston
Universities are both rated sixteenth
for management.
Imperial has maintained its joint
first place ranking in the 'Sciences'
league table, a position shared with
Cambridge and Oxford.
Manchester, placed joint first in
'Sciences' last October has been
beaten back to joint fourth place,
shared with Birmingham, Bristol
and Nottingham. University
College London is joint eleventh,
and King's College London joint
seventeenth.
For the second consecutive time,
Oxford and Cambridge have both
been pipped by Imperial College for
top national engineering college.
Oxford, at second, has climbed one
place since last year. The only other
London college in the 'Top 20
Engineering' is University College,
at joint eighth with six other
colleges.
Imperial is also ranked third best
resourced university, behind
Cambridge and the private
Buckingham. Oxford struggles to a
fourth. Despite a strong first placing
for London in the medicine league
table, Imperial medicine at St
Mary's Hospital Medical School in
Paddington does not feature in the
Top 20 national league. Imperial
failed to secure a placing in last
October's Top 10 medicine table.
University College London is also
ranked first, and King's College
London is placed fifth.
Cancer hospital for axe?
by our N e w s Staff
The Tomlinson axe threatens to
slice London's top cancer hospital
- because it treats too many patients.
A team of health experts will
reportedly tell Virginia Bottomley,
the Health Secretary, that the Royal
Marsden Hospital should be shut as
part of the Government's response
to the Tomlinson Report.
Mrs Bottomley told the House of
Commons earlier this year that the
Marsden may form part of a new
'Chelsea Health Sciences Centre',
in collaboration with the Royal
Brompton, the Chelsea Westminster
Hospitial, the Institute of Cancer
Research, and Imperial College.
The Marsden was also planning a
joint trust status application with the
Brompton.
