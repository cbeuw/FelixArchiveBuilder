My last alternative is a little more
realistic: The close knit group in
Norman Lamont's prowling
ground, were so shocked that
someone had actually talked about
what actually goes in student halls,
they decided it was best to bury it.
The best way to do this was to apply
gentle pressure, until the writer
pulled back form his (or her)
creative venture.
I'm sure one of these is true, or
maybe I do lean slightly towards the
paranoid. But, you must see my
dilemma: Someone writes nearly
10,000 words of text, lovingly
describing a time which left a clear
impression and then allows it to just
disappear. It doesn't require much
intellect to see that there has been
some pressure applied to the writer.
I would like to know why? It was
a completely harmless piece of
writing, what else would force
anyone to withdraw it?

Mary's sulking
Dear Editor,
Your feature article entitled
'Mary's from the inside' (Felix 965)
was most interesting, and quite
humorous. I think many people are
fairly curious as to what St Mary's
is really like.
I also think it was very impressive
of Felix to find such an article and
print it.
Is it not also true that the article's
author, although presently at St
Mary's, previously studied at
Imperial for three years?
Just goes to show. Once an
Imperial student; always a wanker.

Editorial
On the rare occasion that a token of
recognition happens to find its way
over to South Kensington from St
Mary's, it is grabbed with both
hands and cherished for its rarity.
Such was my reaction when I
received a huge article from
someone at St Mary's writing about
his (or her) first year at the
Paddington Medical School. It was
funny, long and could have kept me
from having to look for another
feature for weeks. In other words,
I liked it. So, lo and behold, I
publish the first double page spread
of the offending literature in last
week's issue of Felix.
Come Monday morning I receive
a phone call explaining that the
author wishes to withdraw the
article. Sure, No problem, it is his
(or her) own work, but why? People
had been offended by it, the author
had checked with a number of the
people concerned in the story, and
they had OKed it. Until, the actual
article was printed, then of course,
everyone complained. I happened to
talk to Marc Swan, President of St
Mary's, he also thought the article
should not have been printed,
because some of the characters
could be identified. Then I received

Have I done this before? Feelings
of Deja vu I think. Oh well, lets
press on.
Another famous charity is giving
its contribution to the fashion
world. The item that will be in
vogue, if it isn't already, is a red
cross, available from, well, almost
everywhere it seems. From the
viewpoint of its beneficiaries, who
cares why people buy them. But is
that what charity has resorted to?
Creating hypes only to exploit them
for good means?

Election Results
With the disaster at the by-elections
over a week ago, isn't it about time
that the chancellor was sacked? He
has done enough damage already.
Why can't John Major take the
hint?

Read the letter from Dave Cohen on
a letter from 'Morton', a character
from the story, complaining about
the fact the article had appeared
(Printed below).
I am very glad that Felix has
produced this reaction. It clearly
means that the magazine I have the
honour of editing has a near divine
status for Medical students. Such is
the reaction against this small event
that I am forced to ignore the given
explanation as a sham and that one
of three conclusions are possible:
That Felix is so popular at St
Mary's, that the appearance of an
extensive article about the Medical
School caused a near riot. The
scenes of celebration at being
recognised by the College magazine
were so outrageous that the author
felt a moral compulsion to put a stop
them. Hence the call on Monday in
which a covering story about people
being recognised was cooked up for
the easily fooled editor.
Maybe, there exist an unwritten
rule 'over the pond' that contact
with the 'trainspotters in South
Kensington' is akin to leprosy. The
fact that time and effort had been
put into communicating with their
filthy rag was an unthinkable insult.
The poor author was then forced to
sit alone in the canteen, spat on by
people passing him (or her) in the
corridor, turned away from his own
home and disowned by his (or her)
page 4, or else none of this will
mean anything. Apologies for the
slightly confused manner of the
following article; this was not easy
to write.
Ignorance is bliss, as they say.
And as usual, they are absolutely
right. How I wish I had never laid
my eyes on Dave Cohen's letter,
well, at least not until after my
birthday (Wed 12th). Most of what
he said was more or less close to
the truth and his style of response
was expected, if only by me.
He had the choice whether to
mock me or not, in the same
manner as I mocked him. And he
did so, but with the wrong intent.
My intention was to try and raise
a laugh from ajoke than had circled
within IC Radio for weeks, months
possibly. He didn't mind then, or
at least that's the feeling I got. The
whole article was itself a joke: the
deliberate confusion with literacy
and literary; the criticism of Dave;
(I am also a member of IC Radio!).
By creating some sort of joke within
ajoke so to speak, I hoped to diffuse
the 'attack' on Dave, and keep it
light-hearted. I had hoped he
wouldn't take it that personally,
being an old joke as well. No real
offence was meant. It seems I was
wrong.
His letter doesn't fail, though. It
was written for the purpose of being
a cruel description of moi, to get
revenge as it were, for something
that he viewed as harmful. I cannot
pretend that it doesn't hurt, because
it does. It hurts a lot. Every
criticism, regardless of what it is
about, hurts. The difference with
this one, is that it is from someone
who doesn't seem the vindictive
type. But, I have survived worse,
far worse. If that's the best he can
come up with, a few blatantly
obvious facts that any cretin could
spot (excuse pun), then frankly his
letter isn't worth piss. In fact, I
would pay more for a poor quality
pint of piss that an entire novel of
his, if he could stretch his writing
talents that far.
This is now turning out to be a
slag off of Dave and I had better
stop here. I don't want to sink his
level; cruel remarks in order to
degrade the subject of the joke; but
if another reply presents itself, then
so be it. He is a bloody good bloke
and is fabulous at running the radio
station. Unlike me, he has what I
would call, an 'ideal face', ie an
acne-free zone and unable to do a
convincing Bugs Bunny impression.
I am surprised that he, or anyone
else who matches the above 'ideal
face' criteria, should get so worked
up about an insignificant, insincere,
superficial analysis by someone like
myself. Count your blessings. Look
at what cards life has dealt you and
be grateful, by comparing them
with what life has dealt others.
Anyway, I now have to look
forward to facing the entire world,
with the knowledge that they will
have probably read this, and Dave's
letter, and hence view me
differently. Some may continue to
laugh at me as always, some will
say I deserved it, a few evil bastards
will be glad. I only want to laugh,
and others to laugh with me. I think
I have learned a few valuable
lessons concerning this pastime, and
I hope certain others have to.
P.J. D o d d
PS. Time to quit writing for Felix
possibly?
PPS. How am I (a) pretentious (b)
a social parasite? Of all the
descriptives that have been used to
portray me, these two have to be
without a doubt, the most inaccurate
ever.
PPPS. I don't know when your
birthday is Dave, but Happy
Fucking Birthday, for whenever it
is.
