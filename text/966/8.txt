Paris in the spring
Have students always been revolting? Jonty Beavanlooks back at theriots
in Paris twentyfiveyears ago.
On the 10th May twenty five years
ago Paris was the scene of a
revolution. French students who
had been marching and protesting
for months, finally allowed their
anger to boil over. It was called the
Night of the Barricades. By the
morning of 11th May the Latin
quarter of Paris had become a
separate country.
Lead by Cohen Bedit, better
known as 'Danny the Red', Jacques
Sauvageot, Alan Krivine and Alain
Geismar, a social revolution took
place behind the barricades. Reform
was demanded not just for
education but for France and the
entire world. Students gave lectures
on the ideals and rights of the
people, while others threw paving
stones at the police. Until the end
of June 1968, when the patience of
the French government wore out,
it looked like another revolution had
taken place France.
Although by no means as radical,
students in the United Kingdom
were also fighting. On University
Campuses all over the country
student activists were marching,
boycotting and demanding. Amid
the general upheaval of the sixties,
students were the radical face of
change; representation of students
was minimal, many University
Vice-Chancellors believed that their
undergraduates were children, not
adults, but by the mid-seventies,
students had forced change. They
had representation on Governing
Bodies of most Higher Education
establishments, a voice on academic
committees and were making
significant changes to their
education.
But has everything been
achieved? Has the radical spirit of
youth gone forever? Is there no
more need to be marching on the
streets, or building barricades?
Although some progress has been
made, immediate horrors such as
the Poll Tax, reductions in benefits,
student loans and cases of meagre
grants being supplemented by
stripping or prostitution, indicate
the need to fight the corner for
students is as great as ever.

Yet the activity of that great
campaigning body the National
Union of Students (NUS) has
recently shown lack of vital signs.
The last eyidence of what is known
as 'Direct Action' was early in
1992, a march to protest about
student poverty. Interesting to note
that the few student from Imperial
that went were not allowed to take
the Imperial College Union banner
with them. Since then, nothing; not
a hint of life. Direct Action, the
term NUS gives to high profile
campaigning (like sit-in's and
marches), appears to be a thing of
the past. In addition, the use of ultra
vires laws has stopped Government
money being used for political
purposes. A revolutionary student
body that campaigns on national
issues has vanished with title chance
of re-emergence.
Since Lorna Fitzsimmons,
current and now re-elected NUS
president came to power the
representative emphasis of the NUS
has changed. Ian Pigg, National
Secretary of the NUS, summed it
up as; 'We have stopped fighting
for students and started winning for
them'. He himself exhibited this
change in calling this phrase a
'soundbite': a punchy piece of
repeatable rhetoric, designed to help
the public understand complex
issues.
But what does he actually mean?
Pigg states, Direct Action is a
means to an end, if it does not
achieve those ends then there is no
point in pursuing it. With the
current climate of Voluntary
Membership, which could have
serious effects on the NUS, we
must make sure our methods of
action have their full effect, Pigg
continues. On last year's march for
student poverty twenty thousand
students attended; it was meant to
be a national demonstration. There
are two and half million students in
the country, and it cuts little ice with
the Education Secretary when we
say that we are two percent angry
about student poverty.
Pigg points out that the students
in Paris in 1968, might have had
idealistic values, but were bogged
down with beaucracy. As soon as
the barriers went up, they elected
committees for revolution and
restructuring. The methods that are
now employed by the NUS involve
lunching with their critics, holding
press conferences and rail tours of
the country. Not the most exciting
or uplifting event for students, but
possibly more effective. Marches
against student loans got litde media
coverage, and had even less effect.
So has the will to agitate gone
from the student body? Pigg
accused that question of evidence of
a middle-class upbringing. He
explains that most students have no
time to be marching or ploting
revolution because they are too busy
holding down a part time job to
survive University. Maybe students
are now interested in getting jobs
and careers after university
changing the world is no longer on
the agenda, that could of course be
middle class upbringing again.
Direct Action had a role to play
twenty five years ago, and the rights
to representation that exist now owe
much to it. Outdated now, but it is
worth remembering the atmosphere
as recorded in this Monday's
Guardian: On this unique social
occasion a raddled old society was
taken on a fantastic liberating
curve, freeing it from political
quackery and cultural fraud.
