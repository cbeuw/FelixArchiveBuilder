'Eclectic', 'original', 'innovative'
are all apt descriptions of this
excellent soul/rap/dance offering
from D*Note. I don't know if this
is their debut but I assume it is—
and a fine one it is too. The styles
bounce from hard-hitting rap to
smooth soul with some fantastic
funky bass-lines and some gorgeous
piano. They really know how to put
an album together. Highlights
include the tuneful, inspired 'Rain'
and the melodic 'D*votion' that
draws the album to a close, there
is an excellent assortment of
samples, and great vocals, sax and
beats that bear repeated listening
without getting boring- This looks
like one of the best offerings we'll
receive this year. Get it!

Hello again, it's brother Rufus (the space
between reviews) and I'd like to tell you about a
funky little club I know called the Moho. It's
great, and full of celebrity bits of blank space—
Jilly Cooper's and Jeffrey Archer's to name a
few—and it is presided over by the lean mean
fingers of our soulful Thursday night muchacho
brother Dom, late of the Skunk Club. Come, be
a dance conquistador!!

What's going on then? Surely it
can't be that massively anti-
establishment figure, Nigel 'Aston
Villa' Kennedy being called 'Dr'.
Well so it would appear for it is he;
M r 'ripped DJ, spiked hair,
obnoxious loud mouth' etc etc.
After getting up Des Drummond's
nose for the last time, our Nige has
joined forces with my namesake,
the once Stephen 'Tintin' Duffy, ex-
Lilac Times to produce an album
inthe vein of Elvis Costello's 'Juliet
Letters'—a pop-classical union
surely doomed to a water grave.
Thus it was with fear and
trembling that I played this record,
ready for the strange solos
reminiscent of John Cage as Nigel
showed off his precocious talent for
all to see. But no, it was not to be.
As time went on, so I was
pleasantly tickled even stimulated
by what was happening. The prima-
donna had failed to pout.
The basic format was the Nigel
played violin, viola, piano etc on
the 'straight' songs and then
inbetween got the chance with short
instrumental 'transitoires' to strut
his funky stuff. Except that he was
really quite subdued, nay even
tuneful. Stephen Duffy wrote all the
other songs, and without Nigel he
would have had a pretty good
album. Quite like the Lilac Times
of old, thoughtful with a delicate

hook, reminiscent love songs
without posteuring. Nigel added the
sparky structure of the sort you get
with Peter Buck's guitar in REM.
Not overpowering but somehow
always present and keen. The
titletrack and 'Natalie' are good
examples of the glistening web
weaved by Yehudi Menuhin's
greater son. There's even some
D*Note at press conference for birthday of one J Beavan
P o r n o for Pyros: P r o n o for
Pyros
Hurrah, hurrah. Lay the path with
blossoms and sweet-smelling
shrubs, for Perry Farrell has
returned with his name in lights and
flashing his arse, branded this time
with the legend 'Porno for Pyros'
for, since Jane's Addiction ahem,
'overdosed'. Comedy. Ain't what
it used to be, is it? I suppose that
have
I'm just not funny might
something to do with it.
'Sadness' and 'Porno for Pyros'
start us off like 'Jane's...' with wah
wah, but as the title track is a
vicious little bastard, this is
excusable. 'Cursed Female' and
'Pets' are more of the same shrill
nastiness we know and love, and
while the album is still ostensibly
chunky punk rockery of a slightly
tasteful screeching on 'She Wants
to Share her Magic' which would
be at home on a Hiister Du album.
What more praise could there be.
Nigel and Stephen, doctored or not
could go far.

funked- up variety, there are some
memorable wickednesses; 'Bad
Shit', the effortlessly sleazy 'Black
Girlfriend' and 'Blood Rag', with
it's feudal- tribe-on-warpath
syncopation, hugely reminiscent of
Adam and the Ants circa Kings of
the Wild Frontier (my god, has it
really been thirteen years?
frightening - sic. Ed), are all fine
examples of Farrell's much-coveted
sinister ministerings.
However, it's not exactly a
groundbreaker, more lukewarm
than shit hot, and looks a touch
jaded when stuck next to 'Frank
Black', for instance (if only because
'Frank Black' shows there is life
after the Pixies for Charlie, whereas
for Perry, it's a clothes horse of a
different hairstyle). So just a little
bit more-of-the-same, you see.
Tasty, mind, and a tad chewy, but
still 'Jane's Addiction-esque', and
heavily in their shadows.
