Megastars, Skeletons
and uncool nieces
The best of all people, said Bernard Shaw, lack conviction of all kinds.
We bore this in mind, dug up the laid back and pulseless Donny
O'Nonchalant and sent him off with our new hero of relaxed cardies and
stillfruit juices, Tintin,for a night ofpastilles and horlicks with MegaCity
Four.

and recall with other-worldly
fondness 'my first conference'. The
fact that on that day I did not exactly
acquit myself journalistically
speaking, I decide to keep to
respectful, grave-consigning way
most of its leftovers have extolled
for the past 13-14 years. He claims
no special motivation behind his
lyrics, and succeeds in transmitting
launching headlong into his
'Hieronymus Bosch' question. His
small beard quivers as .Wiz's
answer, 'I liked it, and we got it
cheap' fires back with devastating
Mega City 4 as if they've got something to laugh about
I dunno; sometimes people really
talk a load of bollocks, don't they?
That this is one such occasion is
quite beyond any wish I may have
to do any different. The fucking
disk drive is whining its pain-in-the-
arse best, even those I generally
consider to be the apex of humanity
have proved capable of being
unreliable wankers, and I am dying
for a cigarette. Add that to the
amount of shits who fail to grasp
that reading things over other
people's shoulders is really fucking
rude, and you may surmise that I
am probably not your best choice
for looking after your loaded AK47
Kalashnikow while you take the
kids fishing. Would that I could
kick you all individually in the face
instead of writing this shit.
So, perhaps I am not in the best
frame of mind to report on the ship
of state of one Mega City 4,
landmarking trekkers of 'Sebastopol
Road' and the embodiment of the
revenge of the crusties, but (Oh
god, you're not going to say 'I'm
a professional' again, are you? - sic.
Ed) oh, nothing. Stop me if I get too
indulgent, won't you.
Thus, we find ourselves in a pub
up Ladbroke Grove, drinking and
chattering nervously. Most of the
other hacks here are from fanzines,
leaving us to anticipate the
inevitable embarrassment of being
seen to know little about our
subject. I ask my colleague what
question he's going to ask, and he
says that it will probably feature the
words 'Album cover', 'Hieronymus
Bosch' and 'Why?'. I nod. Good
one, I say. That'll fool them. He
asks me the same question, and I
shrug, saying 'Oh, motivations, I
suppose... Maybe something on the
POHIO thing'. We congregate
below in a small room with beers
and complementary records; people
wander through to drink by the
canal, effectively blowing the
sanctity of this conference to the
wind. Smart. A n even more
nervous hack asks in terrified,
hushed tones, 'have you ever done
this sort of thing before?'. I nod
heroically, a figure of experience,
myself.
The conference is called open.
It has become very quiet, very quiet
indeed. One of the band says 'Well,
we're more nervous than you', and,
aside from having no qualification
whatsoever to make that statement,
it would seem to get the proceedings
under way. Encouraged, the young
snapper beside us launches himself
with his ace. T know someone's got
to ask the first question, and I
suppose...' We could just sit back,
have a beer, cultivate a rapport with
driiiking contests and recountings of
sexual escapades, couldn't we?
Quite evidently not. They are asked
questions about the media machine,
whether the future for them lies in
Fanzine coverage, and their
necessary reliance on fanzines for
precisely that purpose. A fragile
sliver of a question about punk rock
gets through (I don't know; does
no-one vet these things any more?
- sic. Ed), and Wiz, that is, the
skeleton in the dreads, opens his
polite eulogy on punk in the
a nervous smile to give the
impression that his lyrical
persuasions are both bleeding
obvious and, in fact, the first things
that come in to his head.
More navelly-oriented fanzine
questions later (do you like
fanzines? do you read them? Aren't
they so much better than our
national music press? Isn't Everett
True a wanker?), I chirrup in with
the right here n' happenin' Putting
Our House In Order question,
whether they've been involved,
been asked, been shagged by Jon
'Fat' Beast, and all for charity.
They have (eh, readers?), they will,
and they respect Jon Beast. 'We'd
do anything for him, and he'd do
anything for anyone. Started us off,
he did', they recall with tears in
their eyes. 'Encouraged us, told us
never to give up, told us we were
something special', they sob into
their beer. I'm moved. 'What an
evil, vicious bastard...' I say to my
colleague. He in turn nods sadly,
before whipping up a frenzy and
speed. These are aggressive
moments. 'And..' continues Wiz,
'it seems to say everything about
'Sebastopol Road"
Phew. Sigh of relief. We have
contributed, and in a pretty
substantial way. Naah, who am I
kidding. We went to get wazzed on
the cheap. And we did. Cheers,
Ginny.
The conference closes down with
a smack of informality and more
bottled lagers, and the sounds from
above are of the Wonderstuff
covering the Jam, their most
pretentiously 'sensitive', acoustic
moment ever. I'll stay down here,
thanks. They're nice guys, and we
got free beer. Nuff said. I depart
moments after my collaborator has
already done so. Pop stars? Only
inasmuch as Wiz signing his album
for me, and that's only out of
revenge. I signed my book for him
first. That, as Morrissey, Miles and
M r Weller have already
endeavoured to tell us, ' i s
entertainment.
