Heather N o v a
— S p i r i t In Y o u
Having read about Heather's
influences from the sixties mellow
brigade and about her "sparse and
irresistible pop tunes" I was quite
looking forward to this, but I was
- as with most reviews that begin
this way - disappointed. The title
track is an All About Eve rip-off,
even down to the identical vocals.
'Glow stars', the second track was
better, bit bouncy acoustic guitar
and an infectious feeling of livliness
- thugh I couldn't help feeling I'd
heard it all before. Track three,
'Ear to the Ground', was boring,
with no substance (though some
good vox) whilst the fourth,
'Shaking the Doll', returned to All
About Eve land. That said, the EP
had a pleasant feel about it and
showcases Heather's emerging
talent as a singer and writer - though
somewhat unoriginal.

R a d i o h e a d : P o p is d e a d
Now that we are no longer living
under the threat of the bomb, and
impending east/west conflict, the
lies and conceit have been removed
from international politics. No
longer must we hide behind
McCarthyist paranoia and the
idealogical crusades of retarded
screen heroes, no more enemies,
just the occasional 'new Hitler' to
re-educate from time to time.
Thank you America, I'm willing to
die for General Motors aren't
you ?
Nuf-EI-Tee—Let's G o Deeper
This is like the good oF house tunes
of a year or two ago you know, with
a bit of a groove you can get into.
The bass is warm and welcoming,
the synth sounds are ear friendly
and there is a good use of samples.
It even has a singer you can sing.
The track has a 'Frankie Knuckles'

•This lush pop effort is released on
parlophone sometime 'soon'. We
don't know when, we just know it's
out 'soon'. That's what Gareth
'Bronski Beat haircut' Light
reckons anyway, but he's a queer,
and should' be shaved and
imprisoned in a wicker basket
affair. Radiohead are also playing
U L U , when did you say, Gareth?
Not 'soon', was it? 12th May. You
see? you can be precise when you
try...
Radiohead: Naaah.

T h e 4 Of U s — I M i s s Y o u
Cosy and cuddled up in their living
rooms with big rugs and log fires,
smoking pipes, The 4 Of Us could
do no wrong, except they appear to
be stranded in the Q/Vox readers
vacuum of 'grown-up' sensibilities,
with the likes of Hothouse Flowers
and Del Amitri. A l l would be
forgiven, if life, they have Geldof-
like candour; damp trouser legs and
vacant stares, but somehow I doubt
it.
However, T Miss Y o u ' is
intoxicatingly infectious, each time
inching nearer and nearer to pop
perfection, but when the whip
comes down, it flounders, finishing
firmly in obscurity. The metaphoric
'She Hits Me' hurts me in more
ways than I care to explain but does
not leave me paralysed (as in the
song).
Swaying sadly, 'Stung, Stuck and
Stranded' is the articulate,
alliterative allusion to being
dumped, but is not a result of
subsequent creative misanthropy,
more likely as the final filler to this
guide to the trials and tribulations
of love—that sticky feeling that
ironically makes you feel small.
(Spot the cliche and lust ambiguity).
The intersong interview
highlights their lack of humour,
despite the delicious delivery and is
a sham(e). Personally I prefer the
subtleties of nonchalant humour: so
much implication with so little
words; right now though, I'm going
home to tease all my insatiable
orifices.

feel to it, especially track three,
'Club Dub M i x ' (original remix
name lads!), which is the best—a bit
rougher sounding.
The tune even gets away with
breaking two of my personal rules
about good tunesmanship: firsdy, it
has pianos in it—you know
Clough's boxing glove piano lines,
and the bass line is just on phrase
(which is sampled from
somewhere).
It may be, just possibly and also
might be a potential hit. But I doubt
it. I'd play it on my radio show
anyway.

The Auteurs are not like Suede.
They are creative.
Heavenly.

• Out now on Hut. (Is that it? It
seems that, instead of asking for
'Any music journalists to review
records', I appear to have shouted
'any old wankers to write a small
pile of shite that bears no relevance
to what they're supposed to be
reviewing', doesn't it? Maybe it'll
turn out nice again, but I doubt it
