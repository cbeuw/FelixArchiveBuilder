SECURITY
AT IC
In an organisation as large as I.C., with its great number of
research projects and its valuable equipment, security plays an im-
portant part. Thus it is disturbing to find that security is not what
it should be, especially in the Union building, and that virtually any-
one could walk in and walk off with anything he wished.
SOVIET UNION

Union
Under the present conditions
the security guards spend more of
their time ensuring that experi-
ments do not go berserk than they
do controlling the movement of
people in the buildings. The situ-
ation is especially bad in the
Union Building which they des-
cribe as impossible to check.
When the last person leaves the
Union Building the Duty Officer
makes a final check, sees that
certain doors are bolted and re-
ports to the Security Guards,
whose responsibility the building
then becomes. Often, however,
this is not done, especially when
members of Dramsoc., Ents and
FELIX are working. After this
the building is patrolled about
every two hours. This would be
fairly satisfactory if it were not
for the fact ihat it is almost im-
possible to make sure that the
Union is empty in the first place
as there are three staircases and
several doors through which peo-
ple can gain admission.
Inside the Union there is no
alarm system and so while the
silver cupboard is locked it is still
possible to remove the silver.
Breaking into the Union is simple
as was shown by UC when they
stole Mike at the beginning of
last session. Since then the only
tightening of security has been the
fitting of special window locks at
the back of the Union at street
level. Should a guard be attacked
while on patrol it could be, ac-
cording to the guards, up to two
hours before anyone would seri-
ously begin to search for him. A
check is made on his progress
through a building, but this check
is only to make sure that the job
is being done properly.
Patrols
For instance when on patrol in
the Beit Quadrangle, the guards
have to pass certain clocking,
points at which they register their
time of passing. This system
however can only check his
movements when he returns. In
the new buildings there is a much
more efficient system—one more
benefitting IC—all the clocking
points are connected to a control
panel, and there are facilities for
the patrol man to talk to the con-
trol desk. In this way a guard
can never foe missed for more
than about a quarter of an hour.
In addition if a key to any door
is found to be missing it is pos-
sible to change the cylinder of
the lock in less than half an hour.
This makes security much
tighter in the departments, as it
should be'. In addition, everyone
working after the building has
been closed must have a pass
from the head of the departrrient
and on entering this building sign
in a book. This book is not
another piece of bureaucracy, it
is there to show how many people
are in the building in case of fire.
The book, however, is frequently
ignored, as members of staff have
keys to back doors and have no
need to pass through the main
entrance.
Guards
Possibly the weakest part of the
system is the men themselves.
For the most part the men are
over 50. They do the job for a
variety of reasons—some because
they are only physically able to
do light jobs, some have sidelines
and regard the job as an easy way
of keeping up their stamps. These
men work 45 hours a week, in-
and earn about £16 a week in-
cluding overtime. In a large de-
partment a patrol takes about two
hours, during which time they
must be constantly on the move.
They find their work tiring
and admit that they put their feet
up for a couple of hours, which is
surprising as they say 24 men are
insufficient to look after the whole
campus. When a flood occurs,
which is not infrequent due to
badly clamped pipes on experi-
ments, this deficiency is especially
bad.
Mr. Seaford, the Domestic Bur-
sar, who holds ultimate responsi-
bility, admits that security is not
all that it might be, but adds that
if there were 100 per cent secu-
rity, which is anyway impossible
with the presentfinancialalloca-
tion, the movement of people
would be so restricted as to en-
danger their lives in case of fire.
He says that there are special ar-
rangements for certain parts of
the campus, but what he does not
know is that one night his security
guards were in the Finance Office
when a bell rang which they
thought was the alarm. It turned
out to be another guard ringing
the door bell.
There are possibly two things
which can be done to tighten se-
curity up. One is to double the
number of guards—the other is to
make sure that existing rules
about security are strictly kept
to. This is essential if I.C. wants
to gain any research projects from
the government and industry and
if the Wooden Horse Club want
to keep Mike.
Fortunatelv things are being done
done to improve the securitv.
which is reputed to be among the
best in British universities. When
the new college block is finished
the guards will move their head-
'quarters there and will be able to
follow the movements of every
guard on the campus almost to
the last step.
E X P L O 68
The Exploration Society, now
about 40 members strong, is
hoping to get the backing of the
Exploration Board for four ex-
peditions this summer. Plans are
being made for an expedition to
Sierre Leone to study electric
power and another to Kenya to
study Geology and Botany. Two
other expeditions to study tele-
communications in Ghana and
electric power in Spain have also
been suggested.
As well as organising expedi-
tions, the society gives students
information about cheap travel
abroad, produces a yearly review
and holds a series of lectures.
This year they include talks about
last summer's expeditions to
Greenland, Ethoipia and th Ori-
noco. The next lecture, " Ad-
vanced talk on Kraken" (Nov.
2! st). will be of special interest
to members of IC.
Although well timed, on the
day of the Moscow celebrations,
Tuesday's general studies lecture
on " The Soviet Union 50 Years
After," failed to touch much of
the subject which was not already
known. The lecture was given
jointly by Mr. Colin Williams, the
general secretary of the Anglo-
Soviet Friendship Society and
Mr. Victor Grishin, a member of
the Central Committee of the
Soviet Communist Party, to dis-
cuss comments made in the
Times now and back in 1917
about the Soviet Union.
" Strange," he said. " that the
Times in 1917 should say, 'Those
in Petrograd will live to regret
what it is to give anarchy full
reign,' while today it congratu-
lates the Soviet peoples for their
achievements." Mr. Williams
added further that the Times
credited this advancement not to
ideology, not to the natural re-
sources in Russia, but to the
quality of the Russian people.
" Why was it then," he argued,
"That these qualities had not
revealed themselves before 1917
under the old feudal system ?
After a warning to stu-
dents about the anti-Soviet pro-
paganda he introduced Comrade
Grishin. Unfortunately an inter-
preter was required, which made
some of the well-meant compli-
ments of Mr. Grishin sound like
cold platitudes.
Progress
" The progress of the Soviet
State is a difficult thing to talk
on for a short time," he said,
" But facts and figures can give
an indication of the kind of ad-
vancement made." Great pro-
gress had been made despite the
fact that twenty of the past fifty
years had been spent in wars and
restoring the economy after the
wars. Because the standard of
living had improved generally
over the last few years less money
was to be allocated to heavy in-
dustry but more to light indus-
try, for the production of con-
sumer goods. Experiments are
now being carried out in Russia
in the field of management; to
provide factory managers witfi a
free hand in enterprises, so that
they can use their initiative to
improve efficiency at the works.
Mr. Grishin laughed at the way
western writers thought this was
a move towards capitalism. Such
experiments had been going on
for two years and had proved
very effective.
Later this month OSS are to
start operating night-time blood
doning sessions. This scheme
which is the brain-child of Dr.
Paterson of the Health room,
seeks to make available to hos-
pitals an all night supply of
fresh blood when required for
emergencies.
The mechanics of the scheme
are that the hospital will, in the
event of an emergency, contact
the Southside night porter, who
will knock up one of a number
of known OSS hall members.
He in turn will find from his
list a donor of the right blood
group, who at the time is in his
hall room, and take him to the
health room where the blood will
be drawn and rushed to the hos-
pital.
Finally he concluded that
Russia still had many difficult
problems but they would all be
solved in time by the Soviet
people who are all striving for a
better standard of living and
world peace.
The questions put by the audi-
ence had to be simple in order
to help the interpreter and so
were of a practical rather than
ideological nature. On the ques-
tion of censorship of books and
papers, Mr. Grishin said that
those -which expressed views con-
trary to the moral and ideologi-
cal outlook of the Soviet people
were prohibited.
Mr. Williams concluded the
lecture by saying that we must
be careful not to compare our
sophisticated way ,of life in
Britain which has taken three
hundred years to develop, with
that in Russia which has only
taken fifty years. He said that
we must appreciate that different
peoples in the world have dif-
ferent values and cultures from
ourselves. Further, he said that
progress in the world must be
made towards creating a better
understanding between nations,
and nations must learn to be
friendly towards each other and
to appreciate each other's differ-
ences.
Mr. Grishin presented the Col-
lege with several attractive sou-
venirs and gave a book on Soviet
paintings to the president of the
I.C. Communist Society.
OSS, who are organising the
normal blood doning session
around the college, would like to
emphasise that anyone in hall
who has booked to give blood
but would rather join this
new night scheme, should cross
off and contact Barry Bradshaw
of Civ Eng 3 and Southside 668
(or sign the other list on the
board in the Union). No one
who wants to volunteer for the
night scheme should give blood
at the normal session, as there is
a compulsory 21 week recupera-
tion period between donations.
Remember all blood groups
are equally valuable, as people
fall ill in the same ratio as the
number of people in each group !

NEWTHINK
As incorrectly reported in Felix,
Newthink will be out on Novem-
ber 20th (not the 13th as last issue
states).
This is a new student magazine
co-edited by Piers Corbyn (Phy-
sics 3).
The contents are varied to suit
all tastes, and included in the first
issue are features on " China and
Asia " " Student politics," " De-
fence spending in relation, to our
balanced payments problems,"
and many other well-reasoned
nicely balanced articles.
On being asked to describe the
paper, Piers said : " well; it has
a front page and a back page,
and is definitely the student maga-
zine for this white hot techno-
logical era."
Actually he is being unduly
modest. The paper contains 36
pages, and at Is. 6d. a copy is
also good value for money.
