r e g u l a r patrons were turned away", r e s u l t i n g i n a great l o s s of good w i l l , and over .£150,
which amount they are c l a i m i n g from ICU, The IC men on the card check c l a i m that between
20-30 were not admitted and D r . Weale, t r e a s u r e r of ICU, has s a i d that ICU w i l l not pay
as a j o i n t hop was not sanctioned by the exec, and anyway the permitted l i m i t of 600 i n
the Union b u i l d i n g was probably reached f o r the hop i n which case even IC students should
be -turned away.
