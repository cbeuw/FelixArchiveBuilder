FELIX CROSSWORD

Good-bye Folks! You've a
new What's On Editor now ,and
as my last act before leaving 1
want to say a, big " sod you " to
all the clubs and societies that
have never contributed.
The receipt of a request to
publish information; even
though it arrives days after the
copy had to be at the printers, has
no day. date, time or place on
it (I think all possible combina-
tions have been received, in-
cluding all four), is generally
illegible and doesn't say who
to contact for further informa-
tion and distributing fill-in slips
of paper is not absolutely futile,
So to Dick Middleton, my wel-
come successor: " Best wishes,
you'll need them,"
KEN SIMPSON.

Few for
Common
Market
Three eminent gentlemen—
Michael Alison, Conservative
MP, Roland Moyle, Labour MP,
and Sir Robin Williams—were
greeted by a peak total of some
seventeen students at the political
Society'sfirstTeach-in on Thurs-
day, 2nd November. The theme
was Britain's entry into the Com-
mon Market and Mr. Alison was
first to take the stand.
Chinese Threat
He foresaw a change in future
world power politics, mainly as a
result of the threat of China,
which would direct the attention
of USA and Russia to the Pacific
in a united effort to face China.
This would mean that the USA
would relax political relations in
Europe, while Russia, owing to
its geographical position, would
strengthen its position in Eastern
Europe. He considered that it
was in Europe's interest to form
an alliance, in which internal dif-
ferences would be forgotten, in
order to withstand the pressures
of Russia. Britain has always
been a part of Europe, both his-
torically and geographically, and
so should take steps to join the al-
liance. As regards economics,
his reasoning was not so com-
plete, but he saw that with larger
engineering projects and new
technical developments Britain
would be able to reap great re-
wards from the EEC, despite all
difficulties.
Cost
Sir Robin was not so sure, to
put it mildly. He was very wor-
ried by the effects that the Treaty
of Rome would have on our
private lives. He made the point
that the EEC's institutions could
overrule any law made in Parlia-
ment, and this he considered a
threat to our freedom. He said
that the cost of joining would be
at least £500 million per year—
a heavy burden on the economy.
Mr. Moyle presented a very good
argument in which he estimated
the cost to be nearer £800 million
a year. A large increase in the
cost of living would also result
because of the agricultural policy.

Thus the general impression
was that politically, despite reser-
vations concerning our freedom,
it would be good for Britain to
join the EEC, but for her eco-
nomy's sake it would be better to
remain independent. However,
it was stressed that trade agree-
ments such as EFTA have advan-
ages, and Britain should en-
courage these.
It was announced that the next
Teach-in will be held on Thurs-
day 16th November, when it is
hoped there will be an attendance
more befitting the speakers.
