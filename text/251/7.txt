FELIX 7

B R I G H T O N
About the same time as the sun rose on a cold and damp
November 5th, the doors of a garage in Princes' Gardens Mews were
opened and Boanerges, the City and Guilds College's proud mascot,
a 1902 James and Browne 9 h.p. I onnt-au, in newly polished splen-
dour, was driven out under the careful guidance of Dave Knowles
(driver) and William Mackey (co-driver).
An attempt was about to be made (What do you mean, we've
done it every year since the war) on the great feat in all vintage car
lives—the London-Brighton run, (1967).

yards to Hyde Park followed and,
scattering the crowds in all direc-
tions, Bo arrived at the starting
grid to be greeted by about forty
joyous City and Guilds students
clad, as tradition has it, in py-
jamas, and one rather less joyous
RAC official (" not quite so fast
there, please !")
At 8.25, or thereabouts, Bo was
off, and by the time it reached
Park Lane it had already over-
taken everyone else in its group
(even though most of them had
left a few minutes earlier) and
was going really well down Con-
stitution Hill, along the Mall, and
by the time it reached West-
minster Bridge it was already
catching up the stragglers of the
group that had left earlier. Un-
fortunately a traffic jam had
formed on Westminster Bridge;
still, no trouble—over on the right
hand side of the keep left signs,
over a set of red lights and we
were through round the corner on
two wheels and straight past the
tender car which was carrying
tools, spares and your intrepid
FELIX reporter.
Blow out
All went well for the next two
miles until, on a sharp right hand
bend (well, they are all sharp if
you go round on the wrong side
of the road) with a satisfying bang
(It's the best way to go, says the
driver), a rear tyre blew out. Still
no matter, out came the jack and
new inner tube, off came the tyre,
back on and inflated with the foot
pump within 16 minutes (was that
Prof. Ford I saw on the foot
pump just then?—no, surely not).
Away we went again, flat out to
make up lost time. Suddenly, at
a cross roads, some maniac in a
modern car came across in front
of us (What was that? The lights
were red our way? You must be
colour blind). Bo was going too
fast to brake (well, the footbrake
used to work mate, but you know
how things go) and we were
forced to swerve up the road at
right angles to the intended
course. A quick reverse and we
were back on our way.
Fuel Pump
Up Brixton Hill the engine
started running rough and eventu-
ally stopped. What was the
trouble? nothing serious. Who
turned the fuel tap off? Never
mind, must have been the vibra-
tions. Off once again, through a
few more red lights and we had
made up 10 of the 15 minutes lost
by the wheel change. A few more
miles and the fuel tap was turning
itself off again. Out leaned the
— mind that car in front — co-
driver. Too late, up another Side
street to avoid collision and back
on to the road again.
About another hour, and Gat-
wick was passed and about two
miles further on another punc-
ture; this time the inner tube was
all chewed up. Could it be
" whilst accelerating away from
traffic lights "—quote from
driver, could it be "constantly
going round - corners with the
wheels on the wrong lock "-quote
co-driver. Where has that tender
car got to? about ten minutes
later it caught up, the inner tube
having ben mended by your
FELIX reporter (" I hear he's
from RCS.—No, impossible"),
another 15 minutes and the new
tyre was on (Was that President
Chris O'Donnell I saw on the foot
pump? Surely not).
Stopped
Away again and afer a few
miles on the wrong side of the
road we were flagged down by a
policeman (What were those
signs we had been making? Well,
officer, they mean we've got two
Bo—Brighton Bound
cylinders.)
Suddenly, another blow-out,
same tyre. (You sure he's from
RCS?). The only inner tube left
had no valve, still, get Chris to
pump it up to some fantastic
pressure and bung on a dust cap,
that should hold it. If not, fill it
up with newspapers and old
comes of FELIX and thines.
Then away again, more slowly
this time with only 18 miles to go.
Finding the tyre was holding the
driver increased speed—45 mph
down hills, 30 mph on the flat
(Who said the speed limit for the
run is 20 mph? Never mind,
you can't hold a good car down.)

Success
Nearer and nearer came
Brighton and thicker and thicker
became the traffic (What's that,
Officer, we can't form a 4th lane
on a three lane road, Sorry) but
valiant efforts from the driver got
us through (Prof. Ford, have you
any comments to make about the
driving? Ford: " It left me petri-
fied ") and still running as ever in
came Bo at 12.25. We had made
it again.
Up went Prof. Ford to get the
medal (only bronze, after all that
trouble ?) and off went the crew
and the band of loyal City and
Guilds supporters who had come
down by coach, off to a celebra-
tion dinner at a well-known hotel
(send the bill to FELIX'please)
and a few (who said a few?)
drinks.
GUESTS IN HALL
The Tizard Hall Committee
has suggested a scheme whereby
the arrangements for hall resi-
dents having guests to stay at
weekends could be considerably
improved; so far it has failed to
meet with the approval of the
Halls of Residence Representa-
tives Committee.
At present any resident who
has a guest coming has to wait
until the Friday morning before
the weekend to see if there are
any ;guest rooms available and
there are usually insufficient. The
Hall rules state that anybody who
is going to be away for a weekend
must inform the housekeeper so
that his room can be used as a
guest-room if necessary. For this
the occupant gets nothing but the
knowledge that somebody else
will be using his room, that he
has only one small drawer that
can be locked and that he'll have
to put away the posessions that
he has around the room.
Many people want to have a
guest at some time during the
year and want to know reason-
ably well in advance if a room
will be available, the present ar-
rangements don't seem to satisfy
some of them and this has resul-
ted in the not uncommon pre-
sence of guests in rooms illegally.
The Tizard suggestion is that
a Hall should buy a small number
of camp-beds that residents might
hire to erect in their rooms when
they have a guest at weekends.
There would be regulations under
which residents would supply de-
tails of the guest to the house-
keeper or Sub-Warden in advance
and the housekeeper's or Sub-
Warden's permission should be
given before a camp-bed was
made available. This system has
been used successfully in the Uni-
versity of Keele and elsewhere.
It would, (for the present at
least!) apply to male guests only.
This proposal is meant as an
extension of the present arrange-
ments for guests in Hall, rather
than the institution of a " free for
all" for guests. It is meant to
cater for those who have occa-
sional guests from home or other
universities and not for those
whose mates live in digs in Wim-
bledon and would like to hit the
I.C. scene all weekend.
Survey
Rex Lowin, IC welfare officer,
announced at the council meet-
ing that in anticipation of an
attempt by the Government
to introduce loans to stu-
dents, he intended to conduct
a survey in IC to ascertain how
the means test affects us—what
our average income is—and how
much we spend on essentials.
As he says although this may
not much affect the present
generation, it will give a yardstick
against which future students
may compare their grants.
Rex urges the fullest co-opera-
tion in this survey, as it is only
by a large response that any rele-
vantfiguresmay be obtained.

S E N E S C E N C E ?
Every week there appears vast
quantities of free, disposable,
scrap paper called SENNET. In
view of the regular appearance of
this litter, which admits to origins
at ULU, we thought that an in-
vestigation could profitably be
made while our representative
was there on other business.
Inquiry at the messenger's desk
in ULU brought him sympathetic
(or merely contemptuous?) looks
and directions to the depths of the
ULU building, where he eventu-
ally found an apologetic looking
door bearing the words " SEN-
NET OFFICE." Bracing him-
self for the expected squalor, he
entered and was amazed to find
the minute room immaculate.
Seated at one of the decrepit
(even by Felix standards) type-
writers was a willing female who
optimistically propositioned him
. . . about joining the SENNET
staff. Apparently undismayed by
a polite refusal she proceeded, not
too subtly, to try to extract in-
formation about I.C. and met
with resounding failure. However,
prompted by an upsurge of good-
will he volunteered to give our
ailing rival a helping hand for a
few moments and was soon
pounding away on the above-
mentioned typewriter, shocked to
find that the only available paper
was the reverse sides of used
sheets, while carbon copies were
unknown. At least this explained
the tidyness—there wasn't even
enough scrap paper to make a
mess.
Before leaving he learnt that
the cause of this shortage was the
inadequate financial support re-
ceived from ULU. One wonders
how anyone can possibly be ex-
pected to produce a newspaper
under these conditions and, even
though their product isn't the ulti-
mate in student journalism, how
frustrated the hardworking staff
of SENNET must be.
