FELIX 5
NOT WORTH
TWOPENCE?
Sir,
The last issue of FELIX con-
tains an interiew with our Rector,
Lord Penney, so it is appropriate
that the feelings of many people
about the Rector should be ex-
pressed.
Last Spring, when it was an-
nounced that Lord (then Sir Wil-
liam) Penney was to become our
Rector, a few people (e.g. Mal-
colm Duckett) created a commo-
tion because of Lord Penny's
long and close involvement with
weapons, mainly nuclear, re-
search and development since the
1940s.
Most other people, while real-
ising that many considered that
Lord Penney had " mis-used "
science and that his image was
not therefore, good for IC, which
is, after all, a centre of scientific
and technological progress, felt
that Lord Penney might be all
right as a man and were willing
to " give him a try"; anyway,
what could they do?
Lord Penney had made a num-
ber of appearances at IC, all as
unimpressive (as was noted by
FELIX) as the last.
In his speech to RCS dinner,
Lord Penney did not say much,
but that was only a dinner.
On Commemoration Day Lord
Penney spoke for only five min-
utes, again not saying very much.
Rather unimpressive so far.
When asked by FELIX to
comment on what Wells said in
1934 (IC has no social ideas, etc.,
etc.). Lord Penney said, among
other things, that he would rather
criticise non-scientists for their
ignorance and disinterest in
science and technology. Ignor-
ance and disinterest—when Lord
Penney was asked to comment
on the governments increase in
overseas' students' fees, he said
that he could not offer a con-
sidered opinion.
Surely our Rector should be able
to offer considered opinions; he
should think more, rather than
just be clever. At this moment
when tens of thousands of young
people choose Arts rather than
Sciences, we expect our Rector to
be able to talk for more than five
minutes; he should try to give
us some inspiration and sense of
puurpose in what we are doing—
we want to be able to feel that
science and technology can actu-
all do good—Do we want to
do good?—good for humanity
rather than weapons manufac-
turers.

Mike
Sir,
It was with disappointment
that I heard of the general atti-
tude being taken by the mem-
bers, and more especially the
Exec, of ICU to their mascot,
Mike. That two members of the
Union should consider it neces-
sary to go so far as to steal it
themselves in an attempt to stir
up some interest seems to be a
sad reflection on the state of the
Union. If the two students con-
cerned would get in touch with
me via the Editor of Felix, I will
assist them in any way I can.
The mascot was constructed in
the first place as being represen-
tative of ICU and was only able
to be stolen because of IC student
apathy . . . time after time aur-
ing its construction, student help
promised was not eventually
forthcoming and even now,
nearly a year later, an unlimited
number of students could get in
and out of the Union at night by
the same method used in the
theft.
It seems to me that the Union
should either decide they no
longer want Mike and then decide
what to do with it, or they should
damn-well put it back on the
plinth.
I was also interested to hear
that ex-second year student
Frank Morris was an ex-president
of WHO although I was president
last year and Dick Conn the year
before that!
I still possess the WHO files,
taken to be the documents of
Presidency, so if the President (or
candidate) would get in touch
with me I could pass them on.
Yours faithfully,
RALPH CORNFQRTH.
IC Politics and
the Brain Drain
There is growing talk in these
days of disillusionment with poli-
tics, politicians, democracy and
the whole process of democratic
government.
At a Teach-in a week last
Thursday on the Common Mar-
ket, where three MPs gave their
views on the consequences and
advisability of Britain joining the
Community there was a total of
seventeen members of the College
giving them a hearing. Although
it can be said that this is an old
issue and there is very little that
people do not know about it now,
Lord Chalfont's recent indiscre-
tions at Lausanne and M. Couve
de Murville's Gaullist utterings at
the last meeting of the E.E.C. did
give it a certain topical impor-
tance. The Teach-in certainly
deserved more than the half per
cent of the members of what the
Observer, in a leading article,
called the " . . . Only centre of
excellence in the country! " While
I would be the last person to say
that people ought to go to politi-
cal Teach-ins, the present rumb-
lings in the country on the low
status of its technologists and
scientists and their non-participa-
tion in governmental affairs and
managerial positions seems ridi-
culous, when the students of the
"centre of excellence" are not
concerned about one of the most
important economic and political
decisions ever to be made by
Britain. Why bother about the
" Brain Drain " when the brains
do not, in fact, care about the
country they live in, and thus
would not be an asset to society
anyway? One is led to suggest
that they would be a liability if
they were given a larger share in
major decision making. How
many people know that if Britain
does join the Common Market
food prices would go up by at
least 10 per cent and the general
cost of living by 3 per cent, which
in simple terms means that
Mooney will raise his prices by
at least 15 per cent, so that one
could then have a meal with foul
cutlery for about 5s. in the sub-
terranean regions of Southside?
The brains of this country like to
see magic in hypnotism rather
than heckling their elected Mem-
bers of Parliament. Is it morally
right for the Political Societies
Council to invite three Members
of Parliament on a day of three
bye-elections to lecture to an
audience of seventeen rjeoDle?

Ents
Sir,
In y ' edition dated 1st Octo-
ber, 196/, which appeared on
sale on 1st November, 1967, Col-
cutt made certain allegations
about the intention of Imperial
College Entertainments with re-
gard to the runing of the Plastic
Fairly Tale. 1 would like to take
the opportunity of putting the
record straight.
The Plastic Fairy Tale was en-
visaged as non-profit making en-
tertainment for those members of
the College who wished to spend
an evening dancing to disco-
theque type sounds in surround-
ings which were to be somewhat
gayer and less crowded than it is
possible to provide at a full scale
Saturday evening dance.
Membership was instituted to
give some sort of unity, rather
than exclusiveness, to the club.
This membership is open to all
members of the College Union,
even the Rupgby Club.
Imperial College Entertain-
ments would be most interested
to meet, or be told of, one person
who has been refused member-
ship of the Plastic Fairy Tale.
The main advantage of the mem-
bership system, from the organ-
isers point of view, is that it en-
ables us to prevent the entry of
people who have already spoilt
the entertainment of the other
members within the club. No
one, however, is prejudged when
applying for membership.
Perhaps I canfinishby repeat-
ing the invitation given at the
close of the Plastic Fairy Tale,
every evening; any one who has
any constructive ideas about the
running of the Plastic Fairy Tale
or entertainments in general,
should get in touch with the En-
tertainments Committee and we
will discuss them. We extend
this invitation to Colcutt of
course.
Yours faithfully,
G. SAGE,
Asst. Sec, Ents. Committee.
arid
more Ents
Sir,
Colcutt's invidious remarks in
the last issue made me wonder
how he ever got into I.C. If he
is unable to tell the differerence
between Yak-hair and the hair of
the lesser Mongolian Yeti he
should cease to write on such
topics. (Who ever heard of a
velvet-trimmed Yak anyhow )
As for his remarks about the
Plastic Fairytale, he should have
realised that the easiest way to
get people to come to something
is to suggest that membership is
restricted. Nobody was refused
admission on the opening night,
but perhaps an exception can be
made in his case, just to make
part of his article make sense.
Yours, etc.,
KEITH GUY,
(Chairman I.C. Ents.)
P.S. — I.C. E.NTS=The In-
humane Colcutt for Entertain-
ment.
Police attacked
Dear Sir,
In reply to Mr. Bland's letter
in the last issue of Felix, I say
look at the bruises left by the
police on certain IC students.
I've witnessed enough unproved
police brutality at demonstrations
in the past to know where the
blame lies. Police riding on
horses with batons drawn into a
crowd is ordered from above, not
decided at the time. I know the
Peace Movement fairly well, and
we are not violent.
MALCOLM DUCKETT.
C O L C U T T
My predecessor on this column had some chastening experi-
ences : one or two were at ICWA hands (knees and ?). So I'm hand-
ing over to a group of fictional characters.
The scene : A Council Chamber. A Damoclean sword is sus-
pended over all non-executive members who may dare to disagree
with the executive. The executive enters, like the devil, through a
hole in the floor. They bear a gagged dummy representing ordinary
Union members.
Enter, from the mouth of a suckling babe, a nymphlike figure
disguised as Colcutt, who addressed his tiny audience.
Colcutt:
Too long have you, through ignorance shielded
Not known the power the exec, has wielded.
The exec, playing their self-appointed roles
Have turned into miniature de Gaulles.
Who,findingisolation easy,
Plays his accordion in the Elysee.
And is, Nerolike, amazed to see
The simple folks like you and me
Uninterested in what he pretends to be.
His isolation leads to apathee.
The President: As in Union meetings, I hope no one has anything
to say.
Bob Mackman : Several planks in my election platform wood
improve the year rep. system and perhaps make them more powerful
as a body.
Martin Lack : If someone would give me the idea, I shall arrange
to have Mackman shot as a rebel member of the exec.
Pete Ruhemann : (in triplicate) This could create problems.
This could create problems. This could create problems.
Steve Mallinson : My text for today is far too long and compli-
cated for me to quote at length. But I do think that we should not
consider ourselves here in council as an elite, merely as an oligarchy.
It is far simpler to make decisions in a committee, especially if one can
control that Committee oneself. It is ridiculous to expect 3,500 edu-
cated students to be able to make a decision. Far better, I should say,
to keep the power where we want it. Let us in R.C.C. dispense our
money as we wish but let it go no further. Where will it end if we
introduce student representatives to the decision makers of this Union?
Keith Guy : While disagreeing with little that the exec, have done
to disaffect I.C. students, I dislike the way in which they have gone
about it.
The President: Please defer your remarks, Mr. Guy.
Ian Wells : (a veritable mine of information): Hear, hear.
Guy : Little things please little Mines. I have held my peace
long enough. I should like to say (flashes brilliant smile round
Council!!) that the exec, should tell me when they wish to disillusion
me. I appreciate their power and I know only too well that while
the Union should dictate to Council, who should dictate to the exec,
it is the other way round. But I resent this interference with Ents.
Meddle where else you like but don't meddle with me. (Guy here
goes white in face and Council hopefully waits for him to hit Phillips).
The President: Shall pass this on to my secretary.
Dave Harris : The Exec, is there to meddle; if council objects
they know what they can do about it. Nothing. We as the exec,
conduct the day to day running of the Union. Look after the days and
the years will look after themselves. We keep the Union sufficiently
disorganised to make sure they don't lay afingeron us. We're on
good terms with the B.o.G. (Board of Governors—Colcutt) and so
what is the relevance of the rest of the Union. We give them their
money back, weather and Jordan permitting, in the form of subsidies.
Pete Ruhemann : What is the nature of their subsidies ?
The President (now revealed as Ray Phillips): Money. No more
ruminating, please : I like Pete. (Council gathers round and chants
while Phillips holds gagged dummy aloft.)
We believe that we are here
To act as I.C. Union's peers.
The Union should keep us in check
But up the Council and Exec. .
The three in one is two in three :
It's less for them and more for we.
Colcutt:
The essence of ths brief extract
Shows just how high the cards are stacked
Against those who'd like to break in
And break apart the magic ring
He, who's just passed the Colcutt buck
To me, stirred up a lot of muck
I now should like to make a hit
Stirring up a load of ideas.
Sir,
I am writing this letter to give
the lie to anyone who calls Im-
perial College " a vast inhuman
block of super-powered brains."
I have been kept away from my
work through illness for six
weeks. During this time I have
been deluged with letters, tele-
phone calls and visitors, both
from members of staff and fellow
students. It is certainly most
gratifying to find that one is the
centre of so much interest and
attention ,and I have been very
touched by this. I am writing
to give a permanent record of
this quite spontaneous human
response from people at all levels
of the college.
I regret that I have to abandon
my various permanent posts in an
effort to catch up with my work,
but I do not want anyone to mis-
interpret this necessary resigna-
tion. I should point out that my
illness was not due to overwork
at IC, and I look forward to re-
suming active Union work if
possible next term.
Yours faithfully,
C. E. PHILLIPS.
