Things Looking Good
Gratifyingly, sport at I.C. is
on the " up," both in numbers of
participants and successwise. The
larger clubs, hockey especially,
report increases in numbers and
also some of the smaller clubs.
After one month, the soccer,
squash, rugby, cross country and
hockey clubs, have rlready pro-
duced some exceedingly good re-
sults. Of the other clubs, such as
basketball, fives, fencing, judo,
athletics or boxing, Felix remains
uninformed, and we once again
ask that these clubs let us know
what is happening in their sport.

IC bt XI 2 -Dulwich II 0
IC had their best victory for
some years when they beat Dul-
wich last week. Traditionally our
hardest opponents, they came to
Harlington on a very wet and cold
Saturday afternoon. Although the
ground was very slippery it was
great credit to Arthur Loveday,
the groundsman, that the game
was played at all. Dulwich at-
tacked from the outset and it was
obvious that 1C would have to
play very defensively. So it turned
out for the whole match with
Dulwich continually coming for-
ward while IC relied on quick
counter attacks. The defence
was playing particularly well,
P ir Webb in goal making some
n. gnificent saves and Mike Burn
and Jim Robinson both saving
shots on the line. In two quick
raids in the middle of the second
half Ian Tasney and Mike Pratt
scored to give a very spirited IC
victory.

I.C.4 King's College 0
On Saturday, our undefeated
team travelled down to Mitcham
in pouring rain feeling sure that
the pitch would never be fit for
« match after a week of contin-
uous rain. Fortunately the op-
position were even, more con-
vinced and two of them just
didn't bother to turn up. Our
task was not a difficult one.
With our own solid defence, we
were able to concentrate on find-
ing the holes in theirs. Despite
several missed opportunities, four
goals were scored and eleven
rain-soaked but victorious
players dashed off the pitch for
the hot showers.

I.C. 2—Essex University 0
I.C. 6—Heston 1
The I.C..Mixed Hockey team
played fast and skilfully against
an erratic and often dangerous
Heston team; one Icwarian has a
shiner to prove it, and another a
suspected chipped bone! But the
girls were not the only ones to
suffer In this match as the goal-
keeper made one of the best saves
of the season; half-way across the
D she headed the ball in a manner
which would, have done credit to
Dave Mackay. Don't be deter-
red by this report: Sunday hockey
is very social and any member of
IC Hockey Club or I.C.W.H.C. is
eligible to play—just sign up, on

Cross Country
win league
race
Imperial College won the
London Colleges cross-country
league race at Borough Road
college last Wednesday. Over a
muddy course of four andi a
quarter miles the race was run at
a fast pace which suited our team
who gained second,! seventh,
eigth, fifteenth and sixteenth
places. This was good enough to
win by nine points. The second
team showed C's strength in
dept by finishing eighth out erf
fourteen, beating many other col-
lege'sfirstteams.
Although we won this race, the
first teaah is still lying in second
place and is determined to beat
the "professional" Borough Road
team.

Soccer
2nd XI Trounce
Goldsmiths
After a disappointing start to
the season the second XI has
finally struck true form, now that
a reasonably settled team has
been established.
With their only previous vic-
tories being in the two league
matches against Q.M.C. II and
UC. II, the victory against Gold-
smiths II last Saturday took IC
II to the top of their division in
the U.L. League. This match
proved to be a rout with IC win-
ning 9-0, goals being scored by A.
Richards, A. Ebbutt (2), M.
Whittle (3) and three own goals
from the Goldsmiths full-backs.
The seconds, followed this vic-
tory with another good 3-1 win
against Portsmouth Tech II on
Wednesday. IC came off as wor-
thy winners with three good goals
scored by F. Coldwell, B. Hall
and A. Lafferty.
The rest of the season looks
very promising for this Second XI
and it is pleasing to note that so
many of this team could confi-
dently step into a First XI place
if called upon.
' A successful day at Harlington
was ensured last Wednesday, with
the First XI drawing 2-2 against a
very strong Portsmouth side; the
Fourth XI beating Kings 3rd XI
1-0 and the 7th XI beating L.S.E.
5th XI 5-2.
Starting favourites in both
races, Guilds duly won the Mor-
phy and Lowry Cups, their
seventh double in ten years. The
Guilds crew, with two inter-
nationals, let from the start in the
Morphy race. After one minute
Mines were trailing by one
length with RCS a further three-
quarters length back. After two
minutes Mines spurted to go
clear of RCS and overlap Guilds,
but the latter went smoothly
away to a 1| length lead which
was maintained until the last
few strokes when Mines fell
back. Final result was 1 Guilds,
2 Mines, 3 RCS, distances 2
lengths and 2 lengths.
In the Lowry race, a piece ot
opportunist coxing by Mines
took them away to a one length
lead at the start. Guilds started
slowly but soon overhauled RCS
an dthen Mines. Mines hung on
gamely to the boathouse but then
blew up and trailed in two
lengths behind. Final result:
1 Guilds, 2 Mines, 3 RCS, dis-
tances 2 lengths and 4 lengths.

Good win for
the first XV
In view of the recent bad
weather the Rugby Club have
been lucky in not having any
matches cancelled.
The 1st XV had an excellent
win against Rosslyn Park Club,
the first really strong opposition,
last Saturday. Although main-
taining a territorial advantage it
was only an excellent penalty
goal by John Lum which gave
us a 3-0 advantage at half-time.
In the second half the sense of
urgency increased and towards
the end we ran in two tries by
Dave Bell and Bob Pine, one
being converted by John Lum.
Both tries were built on very
good forward domination —• a
rare achievement against such a
good side.
The Ex 1st XV have been
playing very well indeed, losing
only 5-6 to Rosslyn Park Roe-
bucks due to a last minute try,
last Saturday, and beating a
strong Wasps XV 15-0 this
Saturday.
Once again, in the interests of
the smooth running of the club,
I would appeal to everyone to
consult the team lists regularly as
changes have been made as late
as Friday lunchtime.
