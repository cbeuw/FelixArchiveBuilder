Lengthy Council Meeting
ICU FINANCE
CLARIFIED
I declare this meeting . . . waffle, waffle . . . 2/6 petty cash to

I declare this waffle, waffle closed at 9.03—Late! So went the first
IC Council meeting on Monday, 6th November. However, closer
inspection reveals that amid the many items of Ruhemacratic rubbish
(termed after that famous IC bureaucrat)—apparently so vital to the
smooth-rununir.g of any self-respecting body—there were in fact a
number of issues that proved quite important.
Having quickly cleared min-
utes, matters arising and corre-
spondence, President Phillips
called upon Dr. Ken Weale, the
Union Senior Treasurer, to pre-
sent to Council the financial esti-
mates for the coming session for
their approval.
Explaining that the delay in the
presentation of last session's ac-
counts was solely the fault of the
professional auditor, from whom
an apology (and assurance of
speedy action) had been obtained,
Dr. Weale went on to outline IC's
expected turnover this session,
highlighting the change in system
of grants for constituent colleges.
He proposed that in future each
constituent college should get 18s.
per head instead of the old
amount of 15s. and that in ad-
dition RSM should get £500—it
used to be £400—because they're
only little! He said that this was
really only an administrative
change, as from their grant the
constituent Colleges now could be
expected to cover all their costs
instead of the practice in recent
years of applying to Council for
numerous small supplementary
grants. The small increase of al-
lowance to constituent colleges
resulting from this adjustment
would, he said, put their share
of the ICU expenditure up from
14 per cent to 16 per cent.
Under discussion of these esti-
mates Andy Jordan, one of the IC
floor reps., pointed out that the
Union was due to resume its
policy of putting aside money
each year to cover the cost of re-
furnishing the Union premises.
He said that a working party set
up in 1964 had reported that to
refurnish the Union above the
lounge level (
d
u
e
> last year),
Southside (due in 1972/3) and
the Union parts of the new Col-
lege blocks (about 1979) would
cost about £40,000. lo achieve
this it would be necessary to in-
vest £2,500 each year from ses-
sion 1967/68, by which time it
was expected that following the
quinquennium the Universities
Grants Committee (UGQ would
have raised the Union fee from
£4 to £7 per head per annum.
Priorities
Mr, Jordan went on to say that
the Union should get its priorities
right because at present large
items of "expenditure were favour-
ing small groups of people—he
cited as examples the facts that
the Swimming Club got £160 to
go on tour, Soc. Soc. got given
£22 to send four members o a
conference and the Gliding Club
had an annual grant of £400 for
40 student members. He con-
tinued by saying that to wait until
the expected Union fee increase
materialised before improving our
reserves was not acceptable, be-
cause although this increase
would bring the Union an extra
£9,000 per annum it was not un-
reasonable to suppose that the
cost of living would rise by 3 per
cent per annum or 30 per cent
over the next 10 years, which is
the minimum time before which
we may expect a further increase
of grant. This would mean that
our current financial troubles
would recur for future genera-
tions if we relied upon them to
build up our reserves from their
fee increase.
Reserves
In reply to Mr. Jordan, Dr.
Weale said that the Union re-
serves at the present stood at
£10,000 and that he did not think
that we would suffer by not in-
vesting this year as long as the
expected increase came within the
next two years. Dr. Weale pointed
out that the College authorities
might take a dim view of our in-
vesting money this year as they
had just given us money to offset
last year's deficit.
Andy Jordan then remarked
that the investment ^was for spe-
cific and necessary expenditure
in the future and not just saving
for the hell of it—and when this
outlay became necessary it came
in large quantized sums. To this
Dr. Weale replied that he would
rather think of it coming " inter-
mittently in bursts."
In answer to questions from
various members, Dr. Weale sum-
med up by saying that the matter
of an increased Union fee had
been broached in 1963, agreed
by the College in 1965 and was
due to emerge from the compkx
of quinquennial politics at any
time.
£1000 in year?
To conclude this discussion,
Mr. Jordan put a motion to coun-
cil which read : " that this coun-
cil should take steps to ensure
that there was available at the end
of the year £1,000 to put into the
Union reserves." The rpotion was
defeated, there being four in fa-
vour and a number of abstensions.
Continuing the review of the
estimates, RCC and ACC were
called upon by the Chairman of
SCC to justify their increased
grant; in both cases it appeared
that the increases were solely the
result of inflation and had been

party offset by small economies in
other directions. Mr. Lowin, an-
other floor rep, then suggested
that council increase the amount
allocated to buying newspapers as
this was a good way of attracting
members to the Union. After
some discussion Martin Lack was
requested to investigate the pos-
sibility of re-allocating papers to
give more in the term and fewer
in the vacations.
A motion that Council accept
the estimates was then put and
passed nem con.
The meat of the meeting seem-
ingly now past, there followed
two hours of " discussion " (to
elevate the ensuing chit-chat and
petty bickering to an almost un-
recognisable plane) from which
emerged little.
Following a number of instan-
ces of failing communications,
mainly between Ents Committee
and the Executive, it was agreed
that in future a report of exec
meetings should be posted on the
Council notice board.
The Silwood Park rep said that
the Research Assistant Union fee
ought to be paid by the College
to encourage them to take an
active part in the Union (thus
alleviating the problem of conti-
nuity at Silwood where most stu-
dents are doing a one-year MSc
course). After some discussion
Ray Phillips agreed to bring the
matter up with the Registrar.
Rex Lowin then reported that
there had recently been a meeting
of the Rector's parking committee
at which afigureof 75 spaces for
students' cars in College control-
led areas had been agreed. Coun-
cil instructed the exec and Messrs.
Lowin and Fryer (the Hall rep
on Council) to organise the allo-
cation of these spaces and report
the system of selection used to
council.
Finally, following a request
from an obviously waning Mr.
Jordan that there be more fre-
quent Council meetings to shorten
the proceedings, Ray Phillips
closed the meeting and repaired
to a curry house and " hostelry."
The future of Morphy Dav has been plunged into doubt after
the police intervention in this year's proceedings. It is hard to see
how it can carry on without several changes in its format.
As usual, the three Constituent College armies travelled down
separately, causing havoc to the traffic in South Kensington and the
area of Putney bridge, and distress to travellers and railway staff on
the Underground system. However, before the R.C.S. contingent
finally arrived, the police had appeared in force and forbidderi. the
battle on the towpath to go ahead.
Bob Mackman, Chris O'Donnell
and Ian Wells tried arguing with
the police inspector who was ap-
parently in control of the situa-
tion, but could not prevail upon
him to chnage his mind and let
the celebrations continue accord-
ing to tradition. He took their
names and warned them that if
any missiles were thrown, the of-
fender or offenders could be
be charged with causing a breach
of the peace and would be ar-
rested immediately. A few
minutes later a chief inspector ar-
rived and repeated his subordi-
nate's warning, adding that the
flour bombs which people were
carrying vould be described as
offensive weapons and if any of
them were dropped on the towj
path, this would constitute an
offence under the terms of the
Litter Act. Eventually, after
several minutes of pleading from
the presidents, he agreed to let
them throw custard pies at each
other but steadfastly refused to
allow anything else to take place.
Provocation
Accordingly, atter explicit in-
structions to their followers not to
engage in battle, the three presi-
dents carried out the ancient
ritual, surrounded by a body of
police men. Most of the missiles
were then disposed of in the
River Thames, but unfortunately
a few flour bombs landed in the
vicinity of the members of Her
Majesty's Constabulary and seve-
ral of these gentlemen, including
the chief inspector, turned rather
pale. A few people were severely
warned for doing this but no fur-
ther action was taken, and in
fairness to the Putney Police, it
must be said that they acted with
great restraint in the face of ex-
treme provocation by I.C. stu-
dents.
After cheering the crews home
in the boat races, a body of per-
haps 500 students returned to
South Kensington. Again the rush
hour traffic w.:s continually held
up on Putney Bridge and in Exhi-
bition Road, where a small red
M.G. was carried onto the road
to block the traffic. One person
was carried off to a police'car in
Prince Consort Road for swear-
ing at the police but was released
after Mikj Tait intervened on his
behalf, the arresting officer, by
the way, using much more vehe-
ment language than that which
had caused the arrest. Officers
from the " Police Special Patrol "
then broke up the ring-a-ring-of
roses around the Albert Hall,
and the gathering dispersed
quietly.
It seems that in future years the
police will be quick to clamp
down on Morphy Day activities
as they were this year, so there
seems little likelihod of it continu-
ing in its present form. The in-
convenience caused to members
of the general public can only
reflect badly on the students of
I.C. and this inconvenience should
be minimized in future. Nobody
really wants Morphy Day to die
out altogether, but the activities
may have to be drastically re-
vised. The Constituent College
presidents and vice-presidents in-
tend to meet in the near future to
review the position and it is hoped
that they will come up with ideas
that will meet with the approval
of the students while not alienat-
ing the police and public.
