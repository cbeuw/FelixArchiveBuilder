Coffee Break
Battle of the Silvers...
Cheyenne Jonathan
Known for: Being the pirate, fictional
yes, but a pirate non-the-less
Appears in: Stevenson’s Treasure
Island
Played by: Tim Curry in the Muppet’s
Treasure Island, but has been played
by a whole host of actors
Other appearance: Tim Curry has
also played the awesome role of Frank
Inferta from the Rocky Horror Picture
Show! WIN!
Interesting Facts: He was ship’s quar-
termaster under the notorious Captain
Flint. Silver claims to have served in
the Royal Navy and lost his leg under
“the immortal Hawke”. He was said to
have been the only man whom Flint
ever feared. According to Stevenson’s
letters, the idea for the character of
Long John Silver was inspired by his
real-life friend William Henley, a writ-
er and editor.

We all love
exams!
amongst you should uncover a song title. Well
done to Team Shotgun who were the winner of
last week’s dingbat foray.
Long John
Spot the guy who just finished his exams
Known for: Being a pornstar, oh yeah
she is, well was... who cares!
Starred in: Freshmen Fantasies to
name but one
Played by: Cara Fawn
Other appearance: She featured in the
N.E.R.D music video “Lapdance”
Interesting Facts: Cheyenne has ap-
peared on the dating show “Ship-
mates.” On December 12, 2005, she
was involved in a serious car accident
resulting in severe fractures across her
skull, below the brain, and behind the
eyes. Due to internal bleeding in the
brain, she was airlifted to a trauma cen-
tre in Englewood, Colorado. As of June
2006, Silver began using her real name,
Cara Fawn, in her professional career
as a mainstream non-pornographic
actress, and also became co-executive
producer of the Villikon Chronicles:
Genesis of Evil.
Known for: Using his seduction pow-
ers to beat off the competitors in the
race to become Deputy President
(Education)
Appears in: Guildsheet, that’s the En-
gineers magazine, heard of it? Course
you haven’t!
Played by: Himself, didn’t really think
this through...
Other appearance: Sinfionetta or
some sort of musical playing orgy
group
Interesting Facts: Credit where credit
is due, he did beat off some stiff op-
position. Both of the other candidates
were strong contenders but it was Sil-
ver’s seductive poster that lured in the
helpless girls. Just look at the picture
he submitted. But then again, he is no
porn star and he is certainly not a pi-
rate, therefore he is not a lad and does
not win.
WIN
With exam time drawing to a close for many peo-
ple, (well me at least) the union will see its fair
share of chunder and passed out people. In or-
der to encourage you to drink responsibly, each
week we will be on the look out and run a “spot
the guy who finished his exams” competition. It
might not always be the obvious one... This also
is FUCWIT-eligible so send those answers in!
A
pologies for not updating
the FUCWIT last week.
As we all have exams on
Jov (your editor-in-chief)
took over. And by taking
over, all he managed to do was cock up.
Also, looking at the chart, Dr. Science!
has jumped into P2 in the individual
league. He actually is a real Doctor of
Science too! If you gave him a pint he
would definitely down it. Lad.
Please note that for the “Spot the guy
who just finished his exams”, there is a
picture of the same guy twice. It’s not
an error, and it is definitely not because
we ran out of other pictures to use. He
just has a cool beard.
Anyhow, seeing as I’m writing this
in the early hours of the morning, and
it’s the middle of the exam period, I
thought it would be a nice idea to re-
mind you loyal followers how much
I (and I assume you also) love exams.
NOT! At this point I would like to
mention that I know this joke is in bad
taste, however, I couldn’t care less. I
like bad jokes and will endeavour to
continue using them. Back to the mat-
ter in hand; we all hate exams. Well at
least anyone who isn’t a moderately
socially excluded human being (people
who work hard, it’s not meant to be an
insult so roll with it). They come at the
worst time of year (summer), and an-
noy the comfortable life you were just
getting used to. By this I mean, you get
used to the sun and nice weather, and
then you have to spend all day inside
revising, or writing for felix. Then the
biggest annoyance is your lecturer sets
you a curve ball of an exam and you do
horribly bad in it. Not nice for all the
suffering you have been through right?
Now let me tell you Imperial College
Exam maker guy who also happens to
pick the dates and times of exams. Let
me tell you a thing or two about how to
set exams. Firstly they should be in the
winter, when the weather is shit, and
siting inside and drinking hot choco-
late while revising is a nice thing. Sec-
ondly make all exams in the afternoon.
How many students do you think wake
up in time for a 10AM exam without
being tired? None, that’s how many,
well except people who sleep properly.
That’s a different matter, isn’t it? Wait
no. Last of all make the exams easy
enough so no one fails if they’ve done
just enough work to cover the course.
Thus failing those who have done
nothing. Now my lesson is over, exams
will be held 9th December, 6pm. Fail to
turn up and I won’t care. You won’t fail
though. Last of all check out the mega
photoshopping skills on the £50 note
on the front page.

Fashion Editor – Dan Wan & Kawai Wong
Battle of summer trousers - women
For the majority of us who haven’t a pair of Elle Macpherson legs, good news! Bid farewell to spandex
leggings if you worry about molten plastic on thighs. There are indeed options to sweatless chic! Kawai
Wong and Gabby Gentilcore reports.
My eyes! My eyes! It is always good
to experiment... Spandex though,
belongs strictly to the swimming
pool. Taking off your clothes while
peeling off your skin is not a very
nice thought. Stick to cotton leggings
instead.
Is your dog having a great time
abusing your clothes? No worries,
encourage him! One thing though, you
want the rip to look natural, not fresh
out of the canine/scissors land.
Ripped jeans: use sand paper instead
of scissors. Make sure you wash the
ripped jeans twice to enhance the
natural junkie effect before you strut
Although they don’t appear to be the
most flattering of shapes, when styled
right and worn with confidence, they
can make you look effortlessly chic.
Team with a pair of ballet pumps and
dark glasses for a Parisian inspired,
daytime look. For the evening, all you
need is chunky heels.
Yeah, I know what you’re thinking:
“soooo last season!” What I’m trying
to illustrate is that with the right top
and the right jacket, you’d look just
as fab. One thing with harem is that
you never wear a loose top - you’d just
look like a walking sack of potatoes.
Not good.
They are fab. No more fashion faux-
pas days when you have a jumpsuit
in your wardrobe. One minute before
your 8:30am tube departs, you no long-
er panic as you open your wardrobe
door. You swap “Omg, what should I
wear?” to a gracious Audrey Hepburn
Eye Sore
Ripped Everything Peg Harem
Jumpsuits like motion, slowly slip on the beauti-
ful one piece, grab your bag (possibly
a summer basket from Primark, from
£8), slip into those summery studded
flat sandals (I love you, Balmain. But if
you’re on budget, Peacocks do nicely
studded sandals from £10). OK, thir-
ty more seconds to spare: grab a few
wooden bangles from your accessory
drawer (none of that £200 a piece Lou-
is Vuitton resin bangle business. Go to
Claire’s or Primark instead...)
And who says a jumpsuit has to be
that black and white animal print one
from H&M - you’d walk down the
street and ten other girls will be wear-
ing the same.
A few denim jumpsuit have been
spotted on eBay. Go for a nude/acid
wash colour - bound to be a hit!
Note: the jumpsuit should never be
worn with a belt in the middle. Unless
you want to look like Madonna from
the ‘80s. Accessorise with a chunky
collar necklace, a tailored jacket or
statement making shoes instead. Heels
+ jumpsuits = Perfection!
on the streets.
Ripped tights: get at least 80 denier
tights to enhance that ripped effect,
available from H&M from £5. You
don’t want holes in your tights like the
lady in the purple poncho above, you
would only look like you’d just tripped
and fallen on your knees. So put
down your knife or scissors now. The
best effect can be achieved by a key.
Run the key vertically along your leg
and pull the tights apart horizontally.
You can then achieve the rotten effect
ala the RayBan wearing fox above.
Have you also seen the holed leg-
gings from either H&M (£8) or Amer-
ican Apparel (£32)? Ok, go to Primark,
buy a pair of leggings a size bigger
than normal (so the fringes will flap as
you wear them), get a pair of scissors,
cut only half as deep. Pop them into
the washing machine and voila!
