T
he Medics are wrong.
At least when it comes
to organisation of the hu-
man body. You’ve all seen
those posters in the back
of GCSE Biology of a man stripped to
his, as per your teacher’s persuasion,
skeleton, muscles, or hotpants. Some
of you may even seen those wonder-
ful Halloween props, the model skel-
etons. But I have come to realise that
the human body, or mine at the least,
is something far stranger.
It first came to me a few months back
in the Occupational Health offices.
Fairly routine stuff; check the boxes,
stamp the forms, oh, and draw a quart
of my blood for good measure. Well,
after several attempts to find a vein, the
nurse succeeded in drawing...nothing.
Despite my ruddy complexion, I appar-
ently have no blood. After discovering
that I didn’t have a pulse either, I was
hounded from their offices with much
screaming and Holy Water. It wasn’t a
good afternoon.
Instead of the “classical” models
anatomy and physiology, humans are,
in fact, a loose collection of autono-
mous organs, arranged with no par-
ticular care, and held together by wall-
paper paste. Perhaps I’m generalising...
Below is a brief summary of my ab-
normal physiology. If you’re interested
in a Nobel Prize, or perhaps just a
movie and dinner, please get in touch
(rhys.davies08@imperial.ac.uk).
I’ll start with my mouth because he is
often the most vocal. Due to his lack of
a brain, he tends to speak first and let
the other organs worry later. As such,
my mouth often gets me into trouble,
trouble which it has no intention of
getting me out of. If I’m honest, I de-
tect an air of resentment towards him
from the rest of my body.
Moving south, we encounter my
stomach. A much smarter organ by
far, it has to deal with a lot of the crap
Mouth shovels in. I think Stomach may
be the de facto leader of my organism,
since it has no qualms with expelling
something it doesn’t agree with – it has
a particular grudge against Snakebite.
It may have been transplanted into me
from someone with free money – it’s
oblivious to the entire Sainsbury’s Ba-
sics range.
Stomach’s neighbour is my liver. Be-
fitting a student, its favourite past-time
is getting totally sloshed and hang the
consequences. Fortunately, Stomach is
his designated driver, which explains
why I’m not on life support right now
with alcohol poisoning. I’ve often
seen Liver talking with Mouth behind
Stomach’s back; I think they’re plan-
ning to down a bottle of whiskey when
he’s not looking...
My hands have the maturity of a
three-year-old, and twice the energy.
It is their philosophy to do as much is
possible, despite the fact that there’s
just the two of them. Even now, as I
(try to) write this, my left hand is at-
tempting to open a jar of pickled beet-
root, for reasons even he doesn’t fully
understand.
By contrast, my legs are much more
laid back. Actually, they are so laid back
that they border on comatose. Any at-
tempt to move anywhere prompts
cranky groans from them. Why go to
lectures? They grumble, you’ll just be
back here again anyway! They are par-
ticularly frustrated after a session at
the gym. They are not against exercise
as a rule; they just think it’s for other
body parts.
Body parts such as my heart. He likes
to exercise away, all day and all night,
even when all the others organs have
gone to bed. He’s well-meaning but
generally clueless – like a Douglas Ad-
ams protagonist. If another organ tells
him to take a rest or knock the pace
up a notch, he will, no questions asks.
Stomach largely has him under his
thumb.
The mornings are the worst; after
Mouth has knocked back a crate of Re-
lentless. Heart just doesn’t know when
to stop...although, I’m glad for that
currently.
And lastly, there is my brain. The
reason I’m here today and the sup-
posed mastermind of the whole opera-
tion. The mind of an Imperial student
should sleek and focussed, proving the
Riemann hypothesis effortlessly, even
when hungover (Bloody Liver!). The
reality is not nearly so flattering. Brain
is a bundle of neuroses, psychoses and
overdoses, with the consistency of
rice pudding. He’s plagued by OCD,
ADHD, SAD, PMS, SIADH, ABC and
many other acronyms. Over-excited by
all the shiny things that London has to
offer, the poor dear finds it impossible
to focus on anything long enough to get
anything done. His trains of thought
are from Hornby. This is partly why
Stomach is in charge – he doesn’t have
a concentration span equal to that of
an amnesiac goldfish.
So there you have it. I will owe my
eventual degree to my stomach and
my mouth is plotting a coup d’etat. It’s
certainly strange, but I don’t think it’s
abnormal. The human body is a fasci-
nating, awe-inspiring, positively won-
drous...thing! Although, I’m worried
that the next time I see Occupational
Health, Christian Bale/John Connor
will be there waiting for me...

Valerio Chang’s humble opinion on the BNP
I
know that this isn’t a very aca-
demically solid definition, but
I think I remember something
about molecular Diffusion and
Entropy talking about reaching
a equilibrium. As scents diffuse and
heat dissipates from a point source, the
nature of things in the universe is that
a spread of entities is unstoppable till
a optimum point is reached, and any
effort to restore order is futile in the
long run.
Taken this analogy to immigration
policy, I can only interpret the policies
of the British National Party as be-
ing unnatural and against the laws of
nature.
I received a flyer on my doorstep
urging me to vote for the following
policies:
“Committed to stemming and re-
versing the tide of non-white im-
migration and to restoring, by legal
changes, negotiation and consent the
overwhelmingly white makeup of the
British population that existed in Brit-
ain prior to 1948.”
“Firm but voluntary incentives for
immigrants and their descendants to
place of ethnic origin.”
Restricts party membership to “in-
digenous British ethnic groups deriv-
ing from the class of ‘Indigenous Cau-
casian’”. The BNP also accepts white
immigrants that are assimilated into
one of those ethnicities.
The BNP asserts that there are bio-
logical racial differences that deter-
mine the behaviour and character of
individuals of different races, although
it also claims that it does not regard
whites as superior to other ethnic
groups. The party claims that prefer-
ence for one’s own ethnicity is a part of
human nature.
Unlike what other people say, I don’t
think the BNP is racist, or white su-
premacists, I just think their policies
don’t make sense, I have gripes with
every sentence in the above article:
1) They are isolating Caucasians and
non Caucasians, with no other logic
than saying it’s human nature. What
about mixed race babies, where do
they fit in?
2) Why 1948? Saxons come from
south of Berlin, Normandy is in France,
Vikings from Scandinavia, and Homo
Sapiens from Africa...
3) What is a place of ethnic origin?
Where in Africa do you place a ‘Afri-
can’, does one go to Bagladeash, Paki-
stan, Sri Lanka or India? And what if
they don’t speak the language nor have
family ties there?
4) Science and personal experience
tell me upbringing and environment
determine the behaviour and character
of individuals, not race.
5) Should Australians, Canadian and
Americans come back to Europe?
Not very well thought out policies in
my opinion...
How about, “Jobs for skilled and will-
ing workers?”
In fact, when I have the time I’ll set
up a party that promote competitive-
ness for jobs and increase the civil right
of freedom of movement to the extent
“Unlike what
other people
say, I don’t
think the BNP is
racist, or white
supremacists, I
just think their
policies don’t
make sense”
that anyone can enter my country. Ac-
cording to Article 13 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, citizens
may not be forbidden to leave their
country. I shall set a precedent where a
similar provision is set regarding entry
of non-citizens.
Everyone will be welcome to Vale-
rioland, and those who deserve it will
be allow to stay. To make sure people
contribute as much as possible, and the
welfare system will be reform to give
aid to people deserving it.
Deserving is a earn merit, not a
birthright is the BNP claim: their flyer
claim that the British have the right to
Britain (and not immigrant) by citing
Trafalgar, Dunkirk, Falklands...what
logic is that? Does America have the
right to Iraq and Afghan mountains?

I
n my last year at school, Richard
Dawkins came to give a talk. I
don’t recall the subject of his
talk but it was illuminating and
got the intellectual juices flow-
ing nonetheless.
Question time approached and I
had the perfect question to challenge
this brilliant, albeit arrogant, mind. If
we are simply the sum of our chemi-
cal parts, our DNA which wants only
to propagate its existence indefinitely,
then why does love exist? Animals and
human beings have proved since the
days of Caligula and before that love
is not required to get sperm to egg (or
otherwise), so what can be Dawkins’
explanation for this elusive four let-
ter word? Alas, I crumbled under the
pressure of addressing this prestig-
ious figure and my question was left
unanswered.
Love is undoubtedly one of the most
sought after and ethereal things in our
world if one is to go by painting, po-
etry, prose and the hoards of internet
dating sites promising the stuff. It is
the thing which keeps us from despair-
ing and keeps us persisting, a thing of
comfort or maybe of immense pain.
Love comes in many forms – Eros (ro-
mantic, passionate), Ludus (one played
as a game), Storge (friendship), Pragma
(undemonstrative), Mania (obsessive),
Agape (motherly). Anyone reading
this will have experienced at least one
type, although it is Eros that is the
most idolised. I must make a distinc-
tion between love and lust for the two
are quite different. Lust has us beauti-
fying, slimming, pumping iron, flirt-
ing, drinking, networking – in short
anything that will ultimately end in the
exchange of bodily fluids. Love makes
us want to do the above but then also
makes us want to stay for time after-
wards to talk, listen, comfort and enjoy
time with that person we have chosen.
I have always wondered about
Dawkins’ wife - both of them, for he
got divorced from the first one. If your
husband firmly believes that we are
only here as a result of our genes’ in-
satiable drive to persist and that the
whole purpose of our existence is to
produce offspring, then that does not
leave much room for any fanciful no-
tions such as romance and reasons for
spending a fulfilling life with someone.
It is something I wonder, too, about
atheists. I am referring to the hardcore,
nihilistic types and not agnostics who
have not decided either way. How are
these atheists able to bring themselves
to do anything, find purpose in any-
thing, get up in the morning if we are
indeed nothing and will eventually be
even less after we die. Why bother at
all?
I was raised a Catholic and so I have
a sort of ‘instinct’, which has been in-
stilled in me by my parents, that there
is something greater at work, some-
thing going on behind the scenes. Or
perhaps it is arrogance on my part and
I refuse to accept that I am only flesh
and bones and blood and a few chemi-
cals that are released at convenient
times to make me believe I am angry,
sad, and joyful or in love.
Scientists have come up with a mo-
lecular mechanism for “falling in love”
(actually falling in lust) which iden-
tifies hormones, pheromones and
dopamine as some of the factors which
bring about that heady rush of pas-
sion. Is that all it is –our body, driven
by our genes, deciding it wants to sow/
receive a seed and then tricking our
minds into thinking something greater
is at work? Indeed, there is little doubt
about chemical changes that occur in
the body when our senses behold the
one we love, but why should a scientific
explanation extinguish any possibility
that something deeper and unexplain-
able is going on?
The gradual shift from having God
as the basis of our faith to Science as
our faith (certainly among many in
the western world) has brought about
a general consensus that it is either or
and that there can be no symbiosis be-
tween the two.
Falling in love, even if there is more
to it than dopamine, may not be an in-
dication or proof of God, but if you can
not believe that you are with your love
because of something more profound
and special than as a by-product of in-
nate biology then it makes the notion
of love a rather dismal and futile one.
Perhaps the reason behind the end of
Richard’s first marriage is more obvi-
ous now.
Love versus atheism? Caz Knight decides
“Love comes in
many forms [...]
many will have
experienced at
least one type,
although it is
Eros that is the
most idolised”
