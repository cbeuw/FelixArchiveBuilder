Oh yeah, I
got Punk’d!
J
ust off Oxford Street, there are
a number of little indie-electro
havens ready for you to discover.
We’ve all been to The Roxy, but
Punk seems to be completely un-
discovered by the majority of Imperial
students.
This rather small but friendly little
club was an excellent choice for our
Monday night out, a drastic improve-
ment from the Tiger Tiger days of first
term and freshers’ week. With drinks
promotions, such as £2.50 for a single
vodka/whiskey + mixer and an entry
fee of only £5, its perfect for us skint
students. And students it was full of,
just not Imperial ones.
The music played was not what you
might expect given the name of the
club, and there was nobody sporting a
green mohawk, covered in tattoos and

piercings. Instead, the Punk DJs gave
us an eclectic mix of electro-indie;
from brand new chart hits such as La
Roux ‘In for the kill’ and Metro Sta-
tion’s ‘Shake it’, to electro (mostly Jus-
tice) remixes of pretty much anything,
anything you can dance along to. They
even managed to throw in some classic
Prodigy and RUN DMC towards the
end of the night and kindly managed to
refrain from playing The Killers, Vam-
pire Weekend and all the other indie
cheese that everyone knows the words
to but we can all live without.
The words I’d use to describe the
interior would be ‘small but perfectly
formed’. It’s stylish decor and a dance
floor that you don’t stick to makes you
realise why Punk charges you £15 to
get in on any other night. And yes, it
was rather small in comparison to Fab-
ric, Koko and such-like, but bigger def-
initely doesn’t mean better in this case.
The small size of the place just added
to the friendly, inviting atmosphere of
the place.
Of all the clubs I’ve been to in Lon-
don, this is the only one I can honestly
describe as friendly. Everyone seemed
to be simply out to have a good time,
no snobbery, no dodgy looks. I could
stand to queue at the bar without go-
ing insane because the people around
me weren’t trying to crush me against
it or shouting in my ear. I didn’t even
mind sharing my cigarettes with those
‘social smokers’, because they actu-
ally were being social. In fact, one of
the highlights of my night was talking
to new people, either at the bar or in
the smokers area (which was a small
stretch of pavement across the street,

and my friend was sick on it - how em-
barrassing). We were sat outside, get-
ting some air when some guy comes
up and asks to borrow a lighter, we
oblige and he proceeds to tell us his life
story. Annoying, you might think? No,
it was hilarious. It was the first time I’d
heard a story that had no point to it
and I didn’t care about since I read Jade
Goody’s obituary. I find it very rare in
London when people will approach
you and start talking complete rubbish
to you. The story he told ended with
‘And then I moved to London, I think,
I don’t know why. Actually, where do I
live?’. I couldn’t help him answer that
one, and my friend was in hysterics, so
we returned to the dance floor.
Granted, there were a few indie-
Cindys, who, unfortunately, got in the
way when Topshop on Oxford Street
Regent Street or Camden?
was projectile vomiting, and also a few
of the type of guys who wear black-
rimmed glasses on a night out even
though they don’t need them to see,
which I personally find slightly insult-
ing, as I do have to wear glasses in or-
der to see, and those little red marks I
get on the side of my nose after having
lab specs over my prescription glasses
actually HURT! So lets not take they
piss guys, eh? If you don’t need them,
don’t wear them.
But you are going to get those peo-
ple at any indie night, anywhere in the
UK. And a Punk you can kind of let
that go, because the majority of people
were really fun, and that made the at-
mosphere so enjoyable. We had a great
night there, I’d definitely recommend
it. So I’ll see you there next Monday,
yeah?
Regent St might be expensive, but Camden Town will give it a run for its money on cocktails
Sketch, situated on Conduit Street,
just off Regent Street, is possibly one
of the most expensive and exclusive
bars I have yet visited in London. And
if you’re up for rubbing shoulders with
the A-list celebs then I guess this is
as good a spot as any, with the likes
of Pixie Geldof and Nick Grimshaw,
among other London socialites, fre-
quenting both the cocktail bar and the
(extortionately priced) restaurant.
I have to say, the best thing about this
bar would have to be the toilets. I know
that very few people start a review by
talking about the quality and cleanli-
ness of the toilets, but these have to
be seen to be believed. The stairs up
to the toilets look as though somebody
spilled a giant bottle of red nail varnish
all over them. Once inside the toilets,
they’re dazzling; covered in diamanté
and mirrors, they were immaculate.
There was also a woman dressed in a
French Maid’s outfit, standing to give
me a hand towel. As I took the towel
from her hand, I thought to myself,
‘Have Bob Geldof’s children ever
picked up a hand towel for them-
selves?’. I doubt it.
Enough of toilets, the decor in the
rest of the bar was similarly grand. The
Parlour bar is kitted out with as much
modern art as four science students
could possibly cope with. Yet we sat
there and admired the art
and the fabulous interior de-
sign of the bar from our com-
fortable armchairs and chaise
lounges.
The cocktails were of excellent
quality and table service is always a
bonus. The cocktail menu could have
been more extensive; cocktails need
not be limited to those which are made
with champagne. And the champagne
content was definitely reflected in the
price; around £12-£15 per cocktail and
£21 for a bottle of (very average) wine.
And yes, I know you’re wondering, it
was the cheapest on the menu, and the
wine prices rose pretty steeply after
that.
A spot of people-watching revealed
that the people surrounding me were
not what I had previously expected.
Instead of the trendy ‘I-can-never-be-
too-rich-or-too-skinny’ girls which
can be expected at bars such as Ma-
hiki’s, we got a few slightly-too-old and
slightly-too-Botoxed blonde women.
In place of the popped-collars of pink
polo shirts below spikey highlighted
hair, we got tired-looking thirty-some-
things, still wearing their braces or
waistcoats from their day in the City.
However, watching them was quite
entertaining, and I could go back for
more, if somebody else was paying.
Punk: Small but perfectly formed
Fifty-five bar, a cou-
ple of minutes walk
from Camden Town
tube station, is quite
a contrast with Sketch.
Busy and noisy, there were
no celebs present, or bankers;
they were replaced with students and
people dressed in slightly more ‘alter-
native’ attire. As it’s just around the
corner from Camden High Street, it’s
also off the beaten tourist track, which
is always nice when you’re so close
to the tourist haven that is Camden
Market.
The best time to head to fifty-five bar
is early. We went on our way to Koko,
but it would probably be better to go
there after a day shopping or wonder-
ing round the market, as they have
a brilliant 2-for-1 offer on cocktails,
which are not very expensive to start
with. At under £7 for a cocktail (which
is two cocktails between 6-8pm), fifty-
five bar is great value for money, and
the cocktails were surprisingly good.
There are a number of cocktail bars,
which are much closer to home, that
probably charge around the same price
for a cocktail; you could easily compare
them to fifty-five bar, the likes of B@
one and Suburban. However, the qual-
ity of cocktails at these places leave a
little to be desired. Fifty-five bar, on the
other hand provides excellent quality
cocktails at a very reasonable price.
The staff were very friendly, accom-
plished jugglers, and also surprisingly
helpful, advising us on what to choose
and explaining how they use egg
whites to balance the flavour, blend the
drink and add body to it, while adding
a foamy head for aesthetics. You learn
something new every day.
And the flavours of the cocktails
were well balanced, and very enjoy-
able. The variety on the menu meant
that you could stay there all day and
not have the same thing twice, except
you would, because you liked it. They
had everything from your classic ‘Black
Russians’ to ‘FBI’s’; a lovely mixture
of Finlandia Vodka, Baileys and Ice-
cream (best for after dinner).
The relaxed atmosphere was reflect-
ed in the interior decor, comfy leather
sofas and stools next to small wooden
tables. The low lighting allowed can-
dle-light to flicker off the posters which
decorated the deep-red coloured walls,
posters of rock bands from the 70’s and
80’s. They had the same bands playing
in the background; mostly a mixture
of brit-pop with classic rock from the
70’s, 80’s and 90’s.
It was an excellent venue for pre-lash
and I will definitely be heading back
next time I’m in Camden.
