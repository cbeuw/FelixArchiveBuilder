Humanities protest deemed
a “Great success”
LOLCATZ
of
teH
WEEK
Imperial College to be privatised?
Despite the event occurring mid-ex-
ams, today’s protest gathered around
150 students at the Faculty Building
to deliver the message ‘give us back
our humanities’ to Rector, Sir Roy
Anderson.
Cries of ‘Roy, Roy, you take our fees.
Give us back our humanities!’ echoed
around College at lunchtime as over
150 students gathered on Queen’s
Lawn to begin the protest against
course cuts in the Humanities and
Languages Department. Protest Or-
ganisers, Ossain Hynes and Daniel
Burrows, lead the vibrant ‘mob’ to the
Faculty building to hand in the petition
with over 900 names. The protest was
organised in response to the announc-
ment that a 60% cut is due to be made
to the offering of the Humanities and
Languages teaching, losing four lan-
guages and all lower level qualifica-
tions in the remaining four.
Security were out in force and the
Faculty Building was immediately
locked down with noone being allowed
to enter or leave. ICU President, Jenny
Morgan, infiltrated the building with
her nifty swipe card access and per-
suaded the guards to allow Burrows to
enter and hand over his petition. Mor-
gan told Live!: ‘I practically had to beg
for him to be let in. They were worried
we were going to throw eggs or some-
thing.’ Live! is sure the most violent
and competitive act carried out by this
group was choosing Kadhim Shubber’s
chant from a list of proposed battle
cries on the facebook group.
Burrows informed the crowds that
he would keep them informed through
the facebook group and later sent a
message describing the event as a
‘great success’. Professor Charmain
Brinson, Programme Director for Lan-
guages, expressed her gratitude to the
students who took part in the protest
telling Live! that ‘in a global university
and a global society it is misguided
to cut an international language like
Japanese and Arabic completely. This
seems an undue amount of cuts to be
made on one small group.’ However
she remains hopeful that the protests
will help towards finding a more posi-
tive outcome.
Neither Rector, Roy Anderson, nor
any other member of staff from the
Faculty building came out to speak to
the protestors but there was plenty of
interest from people staying behind
the safety of the Blue Glass. A cheeky
wave from Morgan to the fourth floor
indicated that at least one person from
the Rector’s Suite had witnessed the
protest and the crowds disbanded,
feeling they had achieved as much as
they could for today.

I
t has been three weeks since an
anonymous member of the Hu-
manities staff secretly ushered an
internal Staff Consultation Paper
into our hands down in the felix
office. As I took the story to write up
for that week’s issue, I was ignorant to
the potential uproar it has since caused.
Momentum started gathering when
at the same time of that felix issue’s re-
lease, I received an email, again from
an ambiguous signatory from the Hu-
manities staff. It told me of the impend-
ing cuts also. However, this email was
addressed to seemingly everyone the
Humanities Department had on their
database. A personally written email to
each and every student that had taken
up a language course in the last few
years would surely evoke, at the very
least, a sympathetic response to all the
members of staff that will lose their
jobs due to these cuts.
The protest that occurred today,
in my mind, would be the true testa-
ment to the will of Imperial’s students.
I’m glad to say a really decent number
turned up. It could have so easily fall-
en flat on its face, like the countless
number of house parties I’ve tried to
organise via facebook.. There weren’t
1000 + people there, but definitely
enough to make their well-delivered
chant of “Roy, Roy, you take our fees,
give us back our humanities” audible
from across campus.
So, at this stage of the proceedings,
it is the Humanities staff and students
versus the College uppers. The Hu-
manities staff are primarily concerned
with the job losses their department
will see, and have firmly peddled the
‘without languages, your employability
will be reduced’ notion onto the mass
of students. The students have seen

sense, and responded.
The sad case is, I really don’t think
College will budge, considering the fact
they basically made their minds up in
May 2008. In all honestly, their “strate-
gic aims” idea makes sense. A degree
should compose of relevant but exten-
sively covering modules, but I honestly
think languages can be a part of that.
College need to learn that you cannot
give a lollipop to a baby and rip it out of
its mouth once it is enjoying it.
If they claim the cuts are not finan-
cially driven, they need to provide new
alternatives to replace the items being
cut out of the programme. If the stu-
dents just see cuts, they feel depriva-
tion. Implementing cutbacks but filling
those gaps with something else may go
some way to ease some students’ reac-
tion to the alterations. Saying that, it’s
too late for that. The ball in bouncing
in College’s court, to make an official
statement on their own accord; either
to announce that they are sticking
with their guns, or hopefully, listen to
the noise being made in the last three
weeks and announced revised plans for
the Humanities programme.
If I was an upper member of staff
within College, I would make sure that
the newly revised Humanities pro-
gramme for next year is a result of a
student-College compromise. Sir Roy
Anderson said he wanted to bring Im-
perial into line with Oxford and Cam-
bridge in terms of student satisfaction.
Though even further damage has been
done to student satisfaction over this
debacle, it is imperative that he recov-
ers some of this with a revision of the
cutbacks. Otherwise, no matter how
‘world class’ our institution is academi-
cally, we will fall further back on every
other part of university life.
Posters raising awareness about the
20th anniversary of the Tiananmen
Square protests have been slashed by
disgruntled students whilst on display
in the Sherfield building.
The exhibition, by the Imperial
College Public Awareness and Social
Service Society (PASS), is currently
on display outside the Great Hall in an
attempt to educate the student body
about the events of Tiananmen Square
in 1989.
The vandalism was discovered on
Tuesday morning, less than 24 hours
after the exhibition started. Several
posters were slashed with a sharp
implement, presumably to show dis-
pleasure at the choice of subject mat-
ter, despite a specifically dedicated
posterboard for students’ views and
comments.
Keith Hariman, the President-elect
of PASS, told felix that the society had
no political agenda and was simply try-
ing to tell a story which has dominated
modern Chinese history.
One of the comments posted in
Mandarin said that the majority of
non-Chinese students passing by
would ‘think that China really is that
scary.’ Another insisted that the mem-
bers of PASS should be ‘proud to be
Chinese,’ and asked them not to ‘de-
stroy the vision of Chinese unity in the
public arena.’
Official Chinese policy since 1989
has been to cover up the events of ‘6-4’,
a date the rest of the world associates
with the infamous Tiananmen Square
massacre.
Thursday the 4th of June marked the
20th anniversary of the Chinese de-
mocracy movement protests for all but
those who are most affected by it. In an
attempt to prevent people in mainland
China from hearing the story, access
has been blocked to the websites Twit-
ter and Hotmail, as well as a number of
blog hosts.
External newspapers have also been
affected, with some papers either
blocked or interfered with in an at-
tempt to prevent news from reaching
the Chinese people.
Though the government’s stance is
unflinching, the mainland Chinese
students at Imperial are expressing any
of a number of distinct views. Keith
Hariman tells of many Chinese and
foreign students thanking him for or-
ganising the display, believing that the
world deserves to be educated.
There are a few, he admits, that ad-
here to the hardline patriotic view that
the students were to be blamed for
stirring up trouble and killing soldiers.
It is people like this, he supposes,who
ripped the giant crosses through the
posters early last week.
A view he has heard more often,
however, comes from those Chinese
students who are afraid of portraying
a view of China divided. Putting Chi-
nese criticism of China in the public
domain, they claim, weakens the per-
ceived solidarity among Chinese stu-
dents. Another handwritten poster
in Mandarin echoed this view, urging
members of PASS to ‘stop creating
troubles within the campus [...] Our
country is prosperous, and we should
be proud of it. But if our country is hu-
miliated, then so are we.’
Keith finds this ‘love it or leave it’ at-
titude hard to understand. ‘The British
have condemned their slave trade,’ he
pointed out, ‘and the Australians apol-
ogised for massacring the Aborigines.
Why can’t our great country face up to
its history?’
Those Chinese students who strong-
ly believe that the 1989 government
was right in its actions will be difficult
for PASS to win over, but those afraid
of breaking Chinese solidarity can be
reassured. The worry for many of them
is that the rest of the student body will
be too quick to jump to anti-Chinese
conclusions, without taking the time to
get to know the issues.
In an attempt to prevent such apa-
thy, the posters will be up for most
of the coming week, and members of
PASS are almost constantly present to
answer questions and provide transla-
tions of some of the Mandarin text ap-
pearing on the wall.
Imperial students show a mixed set of reactions as newly
formed PASS society hold awareness week on the 1989

Sir Roy Anderson, Rector of Imperial
College, has recently told the Evening
Standard that he would like to see the
top UK universities privitasied, effec-
tively creating the UK equivalent of
the US Ivy League. He told the Evening
Standard that:
“If you take the top five universities,
they have enormous potential to earn
income for Britain. How best to do
that? My own view would be to priva-
tise them. You don’t want to be subject
to the mores of government funding or
changing educational structures.”
This is not the first time that the Sir
Roy has brought into question the ca-
pability of the British Government to
manage the British universities. In his
Jovan Nedić
Editor-in-Chief
interview with felix back in February
(Issues 1,424 & 1,425), Sir Roy was al-
ready questioning the areas in which
the goverment spends their money
and the lack of financial support the
higher education sector receives from
them. He told felix that: “Let’s just say
that there are three or four areas of
government expenditure where a lot of
money could be saved.” When probed a
little further, it was found the automo-
tive sector was one of the key areas of
government spending, but since then
the money going there had been cut.
Following on from that, Sir Roy went
on to say that: “Well there is a lot of
spending in certain areas where it is
not immediately clear that it is what
the world needs at the current point in
time. What we need are some techno-
logical solutions to some really urgent
problems and that includes alternative
sources of energy, and in the interim
before those arrive, we need solutions
to carbon absorption.”
Sir Roy expressed similar thoughts to
the Evening Standard saying that in his
opinion Higher Eduction is “a product
that Britain does superbly” while the
government spends too much time
and effort supporting “dying industries
such as car manufacturing”. Clearly Sir
Roy is proud of what Imperial has to
offer and believes that more should be
spent on research and development.
Back in February, he told felix that the
UK government gives one of the small-
est amounts to R&D out of the G8
countries, yet firmly believes that R&D
is “crucial in developing sophisticated
high-tech manufacturers and indus-
tries” and that they are a solution to
both “socio-economic and technology
problems.”
One of the solutions that Imperial
has employed over the past few years
has been to bring in more and more
international students who are will-
ing to pay in the region of £15,000 or
so a year to get a degree from Impe-
rial College. Currently UK students
pay around £3,000 a year to study at
Imperial which has generated an im-
balance between the cost of training
a UK student and what the govern-
ment give which Sir Roy describes as
“problematic”.
This new move by Sir Anderson is
seen as a method of solving the finan-
cial problem that currently exists, the
question that is constantly hanging
over the average student is: how much?
Currently, the view from a lot of Rec-
tors and Vice-Chancellors is that the
tutiton fee cap placed by the govern-
ment is stiffling and that it needs to be
changed, with many of them calling for
the cap to be raised to £6,500 a year.
However, if the move was made to pri-
vatise these universities, which also in-
clude Oxford, Cambridge, the London
School of Economics and University
College London, then there would be
nothing stopping them increasing the
fees for both home-grown and inter-
national students. As a response to the
possible higher tuition fees, Sir Roy has
indicated that there would be scholar-
ships and bursaries set up to aid the
gifted students.
This method of supporting the
bright students is not a new one. Sir Ri-
chard Sykes mentioned a similar thing
to the BBC back in 2002 where he told
them “if, for example, the fee were set
at £10,500 ... then £16.9m would be
generated if 30% of students paid full
fees and 70% received bursaries.” It was
an early indication that there stood the
possibility of Imperial having a bursary
scheme to aid the incredibly gifted stu-
dent, something that the current Rec-
tor also seems to favour.
A method for solving the financial
problem and the constant constraint
by the British government has been in
the air for quite a few years. If a univer-
sity chose to privatise, they would ef-
fectively solve both of these problems,
however, what impact will this have on
the student body? Will the universities
have to make a compromise between
the quality of the students they admit
and the those who have the money to
pay for the education? Where will the
money initially come for the “scholar-
ship endowment” that will “continue to
take people from all walks of life” as Sir
Roy put it? Or, is this just a way of gen-
erating as much money as they possi-
bly can from students who are already
struggling to cope with the financial
constraints?
Finally, is this the only solution avail-
able? If the government is standing
firmintly on having 50% of students
between 18-23 in higher education,
then they will need more universities
that will spread the money available
to them very thinly. If they are unwill-
ing to change on this, then do the top-
end universities have any other option
available to them? At the moment,
they certainly don’t think they do.
