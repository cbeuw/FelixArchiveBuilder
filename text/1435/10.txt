Look to your left. That
is a schematic of sex.
A good place for such
an act is a bedroom.
A bad place for that
is in a Union toilet. A
terrible place for that is in a Union toilet which
has a fat log floating in it. A distressing place to do
such a thing is in a toilet not just near me, but the
whole of the felix team. Yes we heard you, now
fuck off back to sci-fi... better still Delta Quadrant.
Virgo
This week you start
out on your summer
placement. You’ve
been looking forward
to it for months, so the
night before you lash!
You meet a girl, hitting it off, however when you
go to kiss her you turn it to a light headbutt. How
you can possibly fathom that that’s a good idea is
beyond me- you idiot. She turns out to be your
boss and immediately fires you the next day. Sorry.
Gemini
Shit! Its 2am on Sat-
urday morning and
you’ve run dry of co-
caine, and your usual
dealer is on ‘holi-
day’ in Wormwood
Scrubs. You try to snort flour, but it makes
you sneeze. What to do? You start to scratch
yourself, pleading for coke, literally tearing your
own hair out. However, all is not lost- you shoot
the nearest hoodie- he’s bound to have some.
Pisces
This week you apply
for a new passport as
you have had yours for
10 years and it’s about
to expire. You fill out
all the necessary forms
and send off to the passport office, gleefully await-
ing your shiny new passport. Then things start to
go wrong. First you’ll get a letter through the post
with your old passport, then the coppers show up
at your door and deport you back to Ireland.
Leo
Right. You with the
flat who got burgled.
Keep it to yourself. I
don’t care less. Your
conversation was as
pleasurable as having
a cactus shoved up your arse, i.e. not very. In fu-
ture take your conversation outside and entertain
the Queen’s Lawn. For God’s sake, don’t ever talk
to me, or even force me to listen to you again.
I want to murder you. Now piss off.
Aries
This week will turn
out to be rather better
than expected. After
a trip to the doctors
to get your tetanus
jab, you decide to get
checked for STDs. Turned out you have AIDs.
Your life is fucked. Not normal fucked- proper
bat shit hard fucked. After three days of worry
you find out they mixed the sample up. You’re
clean... but that still leaves someone else fucked!
Scorpio
What is it with the li-
brary being a black hole
for all the wankers at
Imperial? On one hand
it keeps them all away
from me- which is nice,
but I do have to occasionally frequent the place.
I am sure that you are all “great people” and just
“trying to get a good degree” but why do you have
to do it in my vicinity? Leave me the fuck alone.
I want to murder you. Now piss off.
Libra
You are not a well liked
person. Don’t ask me
why because if I start
I fear that I’ll never be
able to stop. It’s people
like you that make me
want to bring back public executions. Seriously
what the fuck is wrong with you? Maybe you are
a bit simple, but it doesn’t mean you have to act
like an overgrown bellend all the time. I really
think you should actually kill yourself. No please.
Taurus
Second library anec-
dote: The library is
a place for working,
occasional quiet chat
and reading. But
primarily work-
ing- especially during exam season. It is not a
FUCKING RECORDING STUDIO so do not
sing under any circumstances. Especially if you
have absolutely zero musical talent whatsoever.
I want to murder you. Now piss off.
Horoscopes - quintessential English ramblings
I’ve been spending a lot of time in the library recently... did you see me? Because I saw you and I’m not happy

Surprise, surprise, MÖchten sie mein Man-

to consistenly finish everything not too long
after them, but it’s just not quick enough.
(Ed: Also I’d like to apologise for royally cock-
ing up the crosswords last week both of them,
my bad, I was just really tired. Hopefully no
mistakes this week!)

Capricorn
This week you will finish
your exams and go to get
absolutely curtained.
Unfortunately, you’re a
considerable lightweight,
unable to handle your
drink and after three hours you are sprawled over
the cold floor of the quad! Your mates help you out
by taking photos, because you always need to know
what happened! Anyone else see that kid on Mon-
day at 5pm? Oliver Joris... we salute you. Pint?
Aquarius
This week you stroll
into the library wear-
ing sunglasses and a
T-shirt with “slacker”
written on the front
of it. You then sit
down, make a fucking hubbub using your big
mouth, but neglect to take those fucking glass-
es off. You look like a twat and on the evidence
presented, I presume you are also a giant cunt.
I want to murder you. Now piss off.

You’ve been working
in the library for a few
weeks now, always next
the same person. He
never seems to move
and is always a little
dozy. When you say “hi” you get no reply, he smells
too. Not of stale sweat- of actual rotting flesh. You
can’t take it anymore- you call security to have him
removed. It turns out that he died of a heart attack.
You never even realised you cold hearted beast.

How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number of lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be one
continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

Well done to Team Shotgun
who were the first to find LU-
BRICANT. Don’t know where
they went and don’t really want
to know. Here is another very
childish word for you to sink
your teeth into.

So which London tube station sums to 132?
This week’s Cat Phone:
_ _ _ _
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.
Mentalist Maze...
Since we decided to give you lads
double points of this, the entries have
been flying in. Literally. But none quite
as fast as that of Team Shotgun well
done to everyone else who entered,
kisses all round. If anyone else wants to
get a whopping 10 points, best get your
answer in fast!

Nonogram 1,435
How to play:
Nonograms are logic puzzles in which cells
in a grid have to be coloured or left blank ac-
cording to numbers at the side of the grid.
The numbers measure how many unbroken
lines or filled-in squares there are in any given
row or column. Look at the solution for help.
Unusually, MÖchten sie mein Manscaft
were the winners of the nonogram yet again.
As they have been for the last stupid number
of weeks. This is getting silly, please challenge
them! There is a free iPod nano in it if you do.
