When did you first get into row-
ing and what were your reasons?
Started at Windsor Boys’ School
when I was 14, for all the usual reasons
like, it got you out of classes and was
really good fun messing about on the
river.
Did you have any other sporting
ambitions as a child?
No, not really I was generally pretty
average at sports although if “avoiding
the ball during a rugby match” was a
sport I would be pretty damn good at it
Why did you come to Imperial
instead of some of the other big
rowing universities?
What other big rowing Universities?
How helpful have ICBC been in
nurturing you progress?
Extremely, the Coaches are superb.
One of them even has an Olympic
Gold medal, the rowing facilities are
the best in the country.
How difficult was it to juggle
academic work and rowing whilst
you were here?
It is always hard to fit in academic
work when you’re tired or have been
travelling around the country but with-
out doing something other than row-
ing it would be quite a dull existence.
How confident were you about
getting any sort of medal before
the race?
I new it would be a challenge even
to make the A-final (top 6) as on pa-
per I had not beaten many of the guys
before. After my first race, the heat, I
finished 4th and I thought I was in for a
shit weekend in Spain but I had a con-
fidence boast duffing up some of the
weaker competitors in the reperchage
that same afternoon and the next day
I was on a mission to turn it around.
How did you feel once you had
won it?
Well I am very chuffed to win my
first senior international medal, it goes
very well in my otherwise empty tro-
phy cabinet.
Do you have aspirations for the
Olympics in 2012 and do you plan
to move up into the 4 man and 8
man boats?
Of course 2012 is the main aim, for
me in the lightweight category there
are six seats, a double and a four. Those
being my options I need to move out of
the single at some point.
Moving away from the rowing
side of things, this is a question
that we have asked previous
sports persons that we inter-
viewed. Should sports clubs
at IC aim for performance or
participation?
Well I think everyone should enjoy
sport and not have to endure the pain
of high-performance. I mean I love do-
ing others sports as well and I generally
suck at most of those. However at IC,
given that there has been such a his-
tory of rowing success and its ideal lo-
cation and set up, it would be a pity to
let it go to waste.
Who is your favourite
sports-person
In rowing it would have to be Alan
Campbell, he is the men’s heavy weight
single sculler (sorry Steve). I have been
a fan of his for a long time, he trains
hard and parties even harder. At the
World Cup Regatta I got to be room
mates with him, probably the highlight
of the weekend, eclipsing even the
medal wining moment.
At outside of rowing it would have
to be Jenson Button - the man’s on fire!
If you couldn’t row at Imperial,
what other sport would you do?
Table football in the union bar
Anyone you want to personally
thank or add?
I think a big thanks to Sport Impe-
rial for developing the rowing at im-
perial and also providing me with a
scholarship

Humanities protest turns violent
A
llegedly... What began as
a peaceful protest quick-
ly got out of hand as
angry students charged
into the Faculty Building
slaughtering all inside before setting
fire to the building. It is rumoured that
several high-ranking officials managed
to flee the massacre including Rector
Sir Roy Anderson and Pro-Rector Julia
Buckingham (to put this into perspec-
tive, our university is called Imperial,
the Pro-Rector is called Buckingham
and her boss is a Sir... right.)
The students, led by the ruthless Os-
sian Hynes and Daniel Burrows (most
commonly known by the moniker ‘The
Butcher’), began the protest on the
Queens Lawn before marching on The
Blue Cube chanting “Roy! Roy! You
took our fees! Now give us back our
manatees!”
The ‘so-called’ manatees which pro-
voked the protest are two 80 year Bi-
ology professors who went missing 3
• Students set fire to the
Faculty Building
• Rector missing, presumed
anxious and tired
A
llegedly... Out of the 20 or
so positions up for grabs
in recent Union elec-
tions (Ed: we’re not sure
what the exact number
was mainly because no one cares) only
10 of the positions were filled, leaving
plenty of CV filler left lying around
unclaimed.
The candidates (people who have
finished exams and have nothing better
weeks ago after using the old College
crest on official documentation.
After a tense 5 minutes camped out-
side the Blue Cube, protestors became
agitated and began throwing glass bot-
tles and eggs at the building. The Rec-
tor himself came out to intercede with
Ossian and ‘The Butcher’. The con-
versation, the content of which is un-
known, seemingly aggravated the situ-
ation as Ossian appeared to knee the
Rector in the balls, sending him fleeing
back into the building. Hangman’s ex-
pert lip-reader has examined footage
of the conversation but has only been
able to interpret the phrases “Bloody
Communists” and “I’m totally going to
knee you in the balls”.
With the College administration in
ruins and its leadership either dead or
in hiding it remains to be seen what
government will emerge in the wake of
the events. It is rumoured that Mr Bur-
rows is set to announce a new era of
violent geekdom later this week.
Allegedly
Hangman Editor
Don’t mess with
biologists
H
istory is littered with
the corpses of dictato-
rial ambitions, foiled
by seemingly innocu-
ous errors or misjudge-
ments. Perhaps if Hitler hadn’t divert-
ed the Luftwaffe from targeting RAF
bases then the Battle of Britain might
not have ended in our favour. Perhaps
if Napolean hadn’t decided to march
into Russia then his empire may have
been preserved. And if the Rector Sir
Roy Anderson hadn’t united teach-
ing staff and students (his two great-
est enemies) alike in opposition to the
disappearences of Henry Pritchdid-
dle and Simone Dinklefiddle, biology
professors with expertise in the field
of manatee research, then perhaps he
wouldn’t have got kicked in the balls
(see above).
Ultimately there was no need for
such heavy-handness so shortly after
taking power. 1 year into the job, Sir
Roy had not yet managed to assert
himself and solidify his base.
His predecessor, Sir Richard ‘Dicky
Dickbird’ Sykes was certainly hated,
but he commanded such fear that he
could act with almost complete impu-
nity. He delivered economic prosper-
ity and as payment he took political
freedoms.
Sir Roy couldn’t claim credit for Im-
perial’s economic success and as an
outsider needed to win over his ad-
ministrative staff. To assert his author-
ity I would have advised taking on the
biochemistry students. With no offi-
cial departmental representation they
are in a word, defenseless. Stamping
on the biochemistrical face would have
ellicited little protest from the rest of
the student body who for the most part
look on biochemists as pitiful sub-hu-
mans. (Biochemistrical is not a word! -
Ed) (Shutup! p.s. I fucked your mom
- Hangman Ed).
But alas, Sir Roy mistakenly took on
the biologists and has paid the highest
price. Whether he will be found in the
ruins of the Blue Cube, having come to
the same end as Adolf Hitler or if he is
in exile and destinied to the same fate
as Napolean is as yet unknown.
Either way, the old adage that his-
tory repeats itself has been proven.
Next dictator on the hitlist. Kim Jong
Il, we’re meeting on the Queen’s Lawn
and marching to Pyongyang. Come!
Mmm I think we’ve mixed up our stories...
Union catering refuses to serve Editor
Scandal continues to dog Union ca-
tering in the latest twist to the food
quality saga. The Editor, Jovan Nedic,
was refused service during lunch at
the Union with catering staff citing a
number of reasons, including:
• Writing negative stories about
Union food
• Thinking negative thoughts
about Union food
as well as generally being a cunt.
Jovan a.k.a. Jov-face, little willy Magee,
the Serbian bare-naked-buttocks, is
apparently livid telling Hangman “Eve-
rything I’ve printed is the bare-naked
truth. If you can find any errors in any
issue of felix that I’ve printed as Editor
then my buttocks aren’t bare-naked”.
Catering staff defended their deci-
sion but took issue with Jovan’s ac-
cusations saying “I think he’s misrep-
resented Union catering completely.
We didn’t simple refuse to serve him.
In fact we served him 34 times in two
hours. We didn’t serve him a 35th time
because we ran out of food (high-qual-
ity food mind you), he ate it all!
Hangman’s nutritional expert cor-
roborated catering’s version of events
saying “A man of Jov’s size could prob-
ably eat 34 plates of food. However,
who the fuck would eat 34 plates of
anything the Union serves”
Election results: exclusive!*
douche douche dooooouche
to do) also included two Sabbatical Of-
ficers. Mark “stick a finger up my bum”
Chamberlain and Hannah “Sharing is
caring is shagging” Theodorou won
the Chairman of The Broad (council)
position and some welfare thing re-
spectively, leaving other candidates
wondering where it all went wrong for
them (hint, no-one likes you).
When asked about their success,
the Sabbs said that: “This is a time for
change. Gone is the era of douchebags
running the Union and bringing its
reputation down to the gutter.”
Adam Gill, the douchebag in the
middle, ran on a campaign on hav-
ing “5 or so good ideas a week” some
of which might be related to welfare
(yes, the cuntbag who does satire bet-
ter than Hangman is now your welfare
campaigns officer...
*it might not be an exclusive, sorry.
