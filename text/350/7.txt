A w e e k last Saturday,
l.C. C r o s s - C o u n t r y C l u b
took on the might of
L.S.E. at Petersham.
T h i s s h o u l d have been
a triangular match, but
Sandhurst couldn't make
it, having cocked-up
their fixture list. Our 10
runners narrowly lost to
their 1 1 , although L.S.E.
did field an illegal run-
ner, so w e w o n really.
First home for l . C .
w a s Rob A l l i n s o n in
third place in a s c o r c h -
ing personal best of 2 8 m
5Ts, followed by Ian
" S a i l o r " Ellis in 3 0 m
12s (you k n o w what they
say about people w h o
wear purple). Our last
three runners, Keith
" t h e y didn't see me
meat, d i d t h e y ? " A h l e r s ,
P. Donnelly, E s q . a n d
Dave J o n e s (from the
hub of the West, H e m -
mersmiff), finished to-
gether, well d o w n the
field.
The U n i o n Bar then

able P a d R E F U S I N G a

equally unbelievable one
of Ian b u y i n g a round.
CROSS-COUNTRY
OFF T O T H E B O L T O N S
In fact, o n l y three P A ' s
stayed the course till
c h u c k i n g out time —
M i k e , Ian, I and Keith
(nearly), the"latter being
a permanent fixture in
the Bar.
Dave Payne was on a
dirty weekend in the
M i d l a n d s , so he can't
get a mention for this
one. T h e gimp w a s also
absent, undoubtedly
getting on someone
else's w i c k .
On S u n d a y the team
played C . W . E n g . I at
football, l o s i n g out 1-0
(unlucky, Pad). Dave
J o n e s kept a tight grip
on the opposition, parti-
cularly their female
winger.
On W e d n e s d a y we
ran the Osterley Park re-
lay in surprise, surprise,
"Osterley Park, Five
teams had been entered,
but only three c o u l d be
r a i s e d due to injuries,
many being caused by
non Cross-Country acti-
vities. W e c o u l d soon
be back to the halcyon
days of last season.
Dave J . was w o r k i n g
hard (so he can b e c o m e
Dr. S p o c k instead of
plain M r . S p o c k ) .
Rob A l l i n s o n d i d an-
other superman run
(quote, " M y valuables
are in- m y t r o u s e r s " ) ,
d o i n g the three-mile
course in 1 5 m 27s. T h e
course itself was as flat
as a w i t c h ' s tit, w h i c h
perhaps accounts for
Paul " G r a n n y " Clarke
doing 1 6 m 4 0 s (sniff).
The rest of the first team
w a s Phil M E E - l e r a n d
J o c k Strap, w h o really
put the balls o n it by
a l l o w i n g L.S.E. to beat
us.
The s e c o n d team was
" A n k l e " W e b b , A s h l e y
Cooper, H . Artist a n d
M i k e W e l f o r d . Steve d i d
a very fast time, sug-
gesting some secret
training had been going
on.
T h e W-nkers team
fully lived up to its
name, w i t h Dave Payne
not quite recovered from
it. P. Artist ( P a d ) , Dave
H o w l b r o o k e and A n d y
Fairhead. T h i s w a s not a
performance of merit.
After the race, a rapid
adjournment w a s made
to the Queens, reached
2 0 minutes before open-
ing time, and then on to
the U n i o n . W h e n the
meeting finally dis-
persed, A l f hadn't been
for one and a half hours
and M i k e ( A C C II) W e l -
ford w a s still going
strong (it's the tankard
that makes you excel . . .
uuuh.). V i s i t s w e r e then
paid to Keith a n d P a d ,
w h o wasn't in. W e had
thought of going to see
the gimp, but d e c i d e d he
might not like his sink
p-ssed in.
The League results
have n o w been correct-
ed again — the finders
of any more mistakes
w i l l be rewarded w i t h a
boot up the arse (keep
searching Ronald).
T h i s week's motto: A
dehydrated man can't
add. Happy Christmas,
and don't get too p i s s e d !

IC 0, KINGS 2
l.C. travelled to C o l -
liers W o o d last Satur-
day to play K i n g ' s C o l -
lege in the First R o u n d
of the U L U C u p , w h i c h
w e have w o n for the past
three years. The game
w a s played under arctic
conditions on a rock
hard p i t c h .
After five minutes
Stevie Bates was injured
in a c o l l i s i o n w i t h t h e
K i n g ' s left-back, w h i c h
s l o w e d him d o w n for the
rest of the game. T h i s
w a s shortly f o l l o w e d by
injuries to Ron (V.P.)
Kill a n d B o b Day. Bob
bravely carried o n , but
l.C. w e r e forced to sub-
stitute h i m ten minutes
later a n d brought o n
Paul Worthington. K i n g ' s
had the better of the
first half, but no goals
w e r e s c o r e d . The refe-
ree gave several unusual
decisions completly baff-
ling the l . C . team.
In the s e c o n d half
I.C.'s re-shuffled team
began to settle d o w n a n d
their strength began to
tell. The K i n g ' s goal
w a s under a state of
siege, but despite con-
stant pressure, l.C. failed
to create many chances.
The two best Chances
fell to Batesie a n d Ian
Bell, but both shot w i d e .
A s extra-time drew near

l.C. w e r e confident of

team w e r e tiring badly.
W i t h five minutes to go
l.C. p u s h e d a l l their men
up to force a goal. A .
Batesie blockbuster hit
a K i n g ' s defender and
flew up the pitch to a
lone K i n g ' s player, and
from this breakaway
Kings scored a lucky
goal.
N o w with nothing to
lose, l.C. attacked w i t h
every man and from an-
other breakaway K i n g ' s
scored in the last m i n -
ute to make it 2-0. O n
a day w h e n the defence
had played w e l l , I.C.'s
attack was just not good
enough.
After the game, dis-
appointed captain B e l !

there's still a job for you
at Brighton.

IC II 4, KINGS II 1
M e a n w h i l e , at Har-
lington, the s e c o n d team
gained revenge by beat-
ing Kings II by 4-1 in the
Upper Reserves C u p .
Kings adapted better to
the tricky conditions, but
were denied any reward
by I.C.'s s o l i d defence.
Bill Pike opened the
scoring, f o l l o w i n g up a
Martin Clark shot. Short-
ly afterwards Kings
equalised w i t h a soft
goal (Oh what a give-
away!). However, the
K i n g ' s goalkeeper was
let d o w n by his defence
and Bill Pike scored two
more goals before half-
time, i n c l u d i n g a
' S a m m y Nelson S p e c i a l '
from thirty yards. I.C.
played badly at the start
of the s e c o n d half and
were only saved by the
courage of A n d y Roberts
in goal w h o m a d e two
magnificent saves. I.C.
then took over the game
completely and due to
the fine Kings goalkeep-
er c o u l d not score more
than the single half goal
from Geoff Gilbert.

After a fine perform-
ance against W a s p s
V a n d a l s the Saturday be-
fore, the l.C. team h a d
no worries when they
learned that they were
to play U . C . on Satur-
day, December 1st.
H a v i n g arrived on the
pitch w i t h their usual
apathetic attitude, l.C.
w e r e lucky not to have 2
tries scored against them

in the first ten minutes.
Only the incompetence
of the U . C . backs saved
l.C. However, after let-
ting in a gift try, l.C. be-
gan to play very w e l l ,
scoring a try through
A l a n Crossley converted
by Dave Rimmer. Dave
also scored two penalty
goals in the first half.
The score at half time
w a s 12-6 in favour of

Throughout the sec-
o n d half l.C. were Com-
pletely outplayed by a
m u c h more enthusiastic
U.C. team and deserved-
ly lost by the frighten-
ing margin of 2 5 - 1 2 .
T h i s was the first match
lost by l.C. to a college
team for 2\ years and
ended a run of seven
successive w i n s against
U.C. »
Is the sporting reputation of l . C . in jeopardy?
W h a t is the cause of the decreasing number of
students participating in sporting activities? Is it
a decline in interest w h i c h has reduced the n u m -
ber of football teams from 7 or 8 to a mere 5 this
season. Perhaps the present employment situa-
tion is pressurising students into getting the best
degree, increasing the work load a n d r e d u c i n g
leisure t i m e ? Or c o u l d it be the lack of money,
w h i c h we are hearing so m u c h about, preventing
sportsmen joining in the social as well as sporting
activities of the clubs. W h a t can be done to i m -
prove the situation, to encourage hidden talent to
c o m e forward a n d enjoy the not to be m i s s e d
cameraderie of l.C. sports clubs. Perhaps if
clubs w e r e to use the facility of the Felix sports
page to publicise their activities, interest may be
aroused, by students being s h o w n that clubs not
o n l y exist, but in fact do have s o m e fixtures! It
is the duty of every captain to see that his c l u b
uses its rightful space in Felix to the full, s o

WINTER TERM REVIEW
There can be few more nostalgic experiences
available to m a n k i n d than looking back over a
term's golf. C y n i c s might say " R u b b i s h ! " and not
be far wrong, but how can one counter s u c h abso-
lutes as " a birdie at the long n i n t h " or " a ten a n d
8 v i c t o r y " without every fibre in the body stiffening
in supreme exhilaration. Non-golfers usually
refer to " L o v e " as the ultimate absolute, but
those well versed in the " r u b of the g r e e n " merely
use this as something to fall back on when their
s w i n g fades. Indeed it is worth a moment's
thought to think how different man's outlook on
life might have been h a d J e s u s been born at
Royal M i d - S u r r e y instead of Bethlehem and been
given " g o l f CIUDS, membership card a n d t a l e n t "
by the " t h r e e w i s e m e n " instead of the other
things. However, that's Christmas, and not the
main theme of this article.
T h i s article is dedicated to those fine warriors
of I.C.G.S. Who trudge the noble road to R i c h m o n d
w e e k after week. M a n y have yet to appear in a
match line-up and so have not been pulled d o w n
by the glittering hand of publicity. For t h e m it is
the mysterious lure of the g a m e w h i c h draws them
to their fate.
A review of the term w o u l d not be complete
without mentioning our record so far:

The reports o n these matches have appeared
in previous editions, so I shall not trouble y o u
w i t h a b l o w - b y - b l o w a c c o u n t except to say that
the team has improved markedly w i t h each
match and is n o w extremely formidable.
T h e hard work put in by the c o m m i t t e e also
is notable. Bill C a l d e r w o o d (vice-captain) has put
in hours of toil scouting for g o o d players as w e l l
as performing his major task of being the first
team superstar. J u l e s Dan has taken on the one-
rous task of secretary w i t h the zest that Barry
M a c k e n z i e might describe as " o f an abbo t u c k i n g
into his first furburger". A d r i a n Evans has
also a d d e d his contribution to the society as
treasurer. H i s tough bargaining technique has led
to the U n i o n treasury considering our club more
equal than others, just as his excellent d i p l o m a c y
has made h i m a man marked for s u c c e s s .
Finally, I have been asked h o w these society
reports c o m e about. It's s i m p l e . Nigel Foster
writes it, J u l e s D a n reads it, Bill C a l d e r w o o d
changes it, a n d A d r i a n Evans pays for it.

CABER-TOSSING
i
F o l l o w i n g the success of our team against
the C a l e d o n i a n C l u b of U . C . where we thrashed
them 14-1 last Saturday, w e turned our attention
to more manly opposition.
It was w i t h high expectations that w e went t »
Neasden football ground to challenge W i l l e s d e n
and District Freemasons to the sport of men.
W e took the field first, and A n g u s M c F a r l a n d ,
using his special steel tipped projectocaber, m a n -
aged a magnificent 5 6 0 yards to skewer the roof
of the c h a n g i n g rooms, in w h i c h the opposition
were cringing. No one was hurt ( m u c h ) .
Despite young brawny A l e c M c C a w l e y ' s ex-
cellent throw of 3 4 0 yards, unfortunately, how-
ever b a c k w a r d s , we w o n 6-0 due to the opposi-
tion retiring with multiple hernias.
