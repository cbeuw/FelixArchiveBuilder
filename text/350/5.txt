Televisions
and
Klepto-
maniacs
Those of you w h o reg-
ularly raise yourselves
up to the first floor of the
Union, to sample the de-
lights of I.C.W.A. lounge
or M o o n e y dinner, may
have noticed that in the
T . V . room w h i c h con-
tained, in days gone by,
honour boards and a col-
our television, nothing
remains but the echoes
of " c o c k - a - l e e k y " and
" T h u m p e r " . This miser-
able state of affairs has
been caused by a rather
puerile theft by Univer-
sity College and d o w n -
right lies or inefficiency
on the part of the T . V .
hire firm. The name-
boards have been re-
turned and s h o u l d be
hanging in the T.V. room
by the time this article
appears. Unfortunately,
British industry hasn't
yet been able to produce
a suitable colour T.V.
(with video input capa-
city for S T O I C ) without
a waiting list w h i c h ap-
pears to increase as time
passes. In the meantime,
a black and white set
w i l l be there. W h e n the
new colour set appears
the black and white set
will go over to Southside
to replace the present
model. A t certain times
(Tuesdays and Fridays
at 1 p.m. and 6 p.m.)
S T O I C puts out pro-
grammes for l.C. stu-
dents. These can be seen
by adjusting the new
televisions to the broad-
cast input position.
If you see anyone
w a l k i n g out of the build-
ing with a T . V . set please
stop them and tell secur-
ity or the Deputy-Presi-
dent, David Sinclair.

A N E W S P O R T !
or don't be lax
— play it!
Perhaps you are fed
up w i t h playing the same
old sport that you have
always played, or you
find that representing the
' n t h ' football or rugby
team is a less than aus-
picious occasion . . . or
perhaps you didn't join
a club at the beginning
of the year and now w i s h
you had . . . W e l l , here's
good news. Next term
there w i l l be vacancies
in the Imperial College
Lacrosse team. O.K.,
What is Lacrosse?
M e n ' s lacrosse should
not be confused w i t h
w o m e n ' s l a c r o s s — t h e
helmets, vizors and pad-
ded leather gauntlets w e
wear when playing are
not for decoration—it's
a hard a n d fast-moving
game. Teams are ten-a-
side and a small ball is
slung around the pitch
w h i c h in layout and size
of goals is somewhat
like an iceJ
hockey pitch.
W e play London teams
and Oxford and C a m -
bridge Universities.
Why vacancies now?
The Imperial lacrosse
team had its most suc-
cessful season last year
when it w a s based on a
nucleus of 2nd-year stu-
dents w h o had been in-
troduced to the game the
previous year. Not sur-
prisingly the team now
has several third-years
in it, and the time has
c o m e to b u i l d a team
again for next year.
So, what should you
do?
Meet under the U n i o n
arch at 2 p.m. on the
first W e d n e s d a y of next
term. The Club will pro-
vide necessary equip-
ment and w e w i l l go into
Hyde Park to give you
an idea of the game. It
doesn't matter if you
have never played before
and of course puts you
under no obligation. W e
have league fixtures
every Saturday and you
could be playing for Im-
perial College within a
few weeks.
If interested, just drop
a note into one of the
following letter-racks—
Union — A. J . Hallett
(captain); Z o o l o g y — P .
Jepson, Zoology I; Phys-
ics—-L. J . Clarke, Phys-
ics III.
W e w i l l be happy tc
answer any questions
about the activities of
the club.
RCC Transport Sub-committee
-change in driver selection
procedure
(from 21st January 1974)
F r o m 21st January,
1 9 7 4 R . C . C . Transport
w i l l require:
(a) A £5.00 personal
deposit from all drivers,
before inclusion on the
drivers list. (This re-
duces the clubs liability
to £20.)
(b) A n y accident or
damage to the vehicles
results i n the drivers
automatic removal from
the list and loss of h i s /
her deposit.
Drivers can appeal
against the above action
to R . C . C . Transport
w h o s e decision shall be
final.
A l l present drivers
w i l l be removed from
the existing list on 21st
January 1 9 7 4 a n d w i l l
be placed on the new
drivers list p r o v i d e d : —
(a) They have a clean
driving licence,
held for at least 2
years;
(b) They complete a
driving test satis-
factorily. There w i l l
be no appeal
against test failure;
(c) They pay the £5.00
personal deposit,
w h i c h is returnable
when they request
withdrawal from
the list;
(d) They re-apply be-
fore the end of the
a u t u m n t e r m
( 1 4 / 1 2 / 7 3 ) other-
wise they w i l l be
subject to another
test fee (25p).
A l l new drivers w i l l be
subject to conditions a,
b a n d c above and in
addition pay the 2 5 p test
fee.
If for any reason
R . C . C . Transport are u n -
able to carry out (b) in
the above conditions be-

drivers w i l l be provision-
ally accepted on satisfy-
ing conditions (a) and

(Contd. from p. 6)
'But there are no tig-
ers in these parts.'
'That's right. Effect-
ive, isn't i t ? ' " .
M o s t of the tales are
longer than these, but
the m i n d-b o g g I i n g
punchlines are a feature
of them all. Maybe it is
pure madness, but it i s
a peculiar brand w h i c h
has survived for nearly a
thousand years, and it
covers a deep w i s d o m
and understanding. After
all, w o u l d it still be so
funny if it didn't?
A must for anyone
pretending to a sense of
humour, but also a book
for thinking over. Defin-
itely recommended.

Devalued Degrees?
W e cannot be expected to hope for m u c h out of
our degrees w h e n :
1.— S i z e of technological a n d scientific projects
are constantly increasing, thus also increasing their
dependence on economical a n d political decisions,
trade unions' decisions, supply or availability of
land and resources, pressure g r o u p s ' claims, inter-
national relations, etc. a n d , w h i l e none of these
factors look very promising, all of them are beyond
the control of the scientist or engineer.
2.— J o b s , salaries and compensations depend
ever more on supply and d e m a n d , experience, bar-
gaining power (unions, national policies, etc.),
meeting the employers' demands (rather than the
college's); and less on degrees, qualifications, col-
lege's prestige, etc.
3.— P e o p l e increasingly lose their confidence i n
" e x p e r t s " (i.e., we), political parties, very large pro-
jects (from large b u i l d i n g s and roads to M a p l i n s
and Concordes), sophisticated technology (e.g.,
nuclear power, etc.).
4.— P r i c e s of fuel, l a n d and resources i n general
are soaring up, plus " o c c a s i o n a l " rationings, plus
constantly decreasing expectations i n fuel reserves,
plus more and more dependence on foreign coun-
tries' supplies a n d demands, plus increased de-
pendence o n supra national corporations, plus
" o c c a s i o n a l " strikes; w h i c h means less chances for
our large scale, highly sophisticated, highly organ-
ised a n d costly (in resources and money) science
and technology.
5.— E v e r larger scale, centralised a n d m o r e c o m -
plicated technology produces ever more pollution
(directly or indirectly); depletion of resources;
drastic environmental changes; obsolescence of
objects, techniques a n d trained or skilled people;
misunderstandings, s u s p i c i o n , mistrust and blind
dependence from the majority of people; larger
scale upredicted side effects, etc.
W h y , then, is it not possible to dedicate some of
the time of our curricula (preferably the time taken
by exams!) to the justification, purpose and future
of our careers? O n what grounds are we expected
to accept the present w a y s of " e d u c a t i o n " ? — ' d o e s
our opinion count at all? Or does it only count
When w e say something " a c a d e m i c " ? Or are w e
expected to learn What is given to us without ques-
tioning and yet believe that w e are not being some-
how indoctrinated?
No doubt the quality of science is declining; no
doubt there is disenchantment w i t h technology;
how can w e be expected to be proud of a Ph.D., if
we don't know what Philosophy or real thinking
means? If w e don't know Why or for What w e are
learning? Are w e expected to believe (like many
people do!) that geniuses can be produced l i k e
boxes of tissues?
Whatever the reasons for this state of things
(tradition, the w o r l d , the government, capitalism,
etc.) it is necessary that w e all look into all these
questions as well as into w h a t kind of education?
For w h o m ? W h e n ? H o w ? By W h o m ? After a l l , what
is education? If w e can't a n s w e r this one clearly,
Why bother w i t h exams?
Merry Exams and Happy N e w Term.

Concert
Review:
Lindisfarne
What a way to e n d up this term's series of c o n -
certs. It was certainly the one I enjoyed the most.
Beforehand I was unsure what to expect, having
heard so little of Lindisfarne since the departure
of A l a n Hull, w h o w a s a very important member,
but they haven't changed m u c h . They're still the
same manly Geordies that I remember from way
back, w i t h their famous Newky, w h i c h they even
sang a song about. Indeed, if i t w a s n ' t for Lindis-
farne, Newcastle B r o w n might never have reached
as far south as London.
A s for t h e i r , m u s i c , it is such that it has an i n -
stantaneous a n d lasting impact. Their songs c a n
be just as enjoyable on the first hearing as they
are on the hundredth. T h e thing about Lindisfarne
is the extra something they put into the atmos-
phere, inducing audience participation w i t h incal-
culable ease. Even people l i k e m e , w h o belong, I
suppose, to the so-called " s i t - d o w n - a n d - b e - c o o l "
class, feel tempted to c l a p their hands in the air.
They d i d several of their newer compositions,
without forgetting the old favourites. They w e r e
all there: " N o T i m e to L o s e " , the ghost-song " L a d y
E l a n o u r " , (nicely changed from the original three-
year old version too), and " F o g on the T y n e " ,
the naughty verse of w h i c h they dedicated, " S i n c e
we're in L o n d o n " , to M a r k and Anne, and let the
audience sing it several times. They finished their
scheduled set w i t h " W e C a n S w i n g T o g e t h e r " , a
song w i t h an interesting history, i n w h i c h Ray
J a c k s o n still does his medley on h a r m o n i c a , >
§
m u c h neglected instrument nowadays, lasting quite
some time and Without being boring. No mean
feat of endurance, w h e n you can do that and still
have enough breath left to sing the final verse as
well.
For the encore they d i d yet another one from the
" N i c e l y Out of T u n e " album, " C l e a r White L i g h t " ,
and finally " W h e n the W a r i s O v e r " , a song w i t h
a lengthy very nice piano-vocal introduction.
It w a s quite a pleasant surprise to me to find
that Claire H a m m i l w a s doing the support act, as
I think she's got a lovely voice, and despite her
recent attack of laryngitis (well that's what she
said), she sang s o m e nice gentle songs, though 1
thought she fairly crucified the Walker Brothers"
" Y o u ' v e Lost that Loving F e e l i n g " .
