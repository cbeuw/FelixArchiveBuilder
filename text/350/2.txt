The
historical (?)
roots of.
Christianity
The lack of s o l i d fact
in J o c k ' s recent expose
of the folly of those w h o
k n o w J e s u s Christ as
Lord and Saviour w a s
expected. T h i s is be-
cause the facts are so
overwhelmingly clear.
The Bible, T a c i t u s , Pliny
and T h a i l u s all w i t n e s s
to J e s u s Christ as being
for more than a mere
m a n .
One of the most over-
w h e l m i n g pieces of evi-
dence is the accuracy of
prophecy in the B i b l e ,
even to this very day.
J e s u s Christ fulfilled
countless m e s s a g e s of
prophecy during his life
on earth, particularly l u -
c i d are those c o n c e r n i n g
his death a n d resurrec-
t i o n . T h e e v i d e n c e for
Christ's resurrection has
never been satisfactorily
explained away, despite
many attempts. These
are d o o m e d to failure,
because the facts speak
for themselves, they say
that J e s u s lis w h o He
said He w a s , the S o n of
G o d . The facts about
Christ are as s o l i d as
any upon w h i c h w e do
our scientific research
a n d yet people still
avoid the issue instead
of facing it h e a d o n . This
is i n fact further evi-
dence that J e s u s is
something s p e c i a l .
The final evidence is
when a man c o m e s into
a personal relationship
with Christ, then he c a n
say "I k n o w J e s u s is
alive today and l o v e s
m e " .
If anyone seriously
doubts this w e suggest,
before w a s t i n g more
space in Felix, that they
look very carefully at the
facts w i t h an open and
(for y o u , A l l ) a truly
scientific m i n d . W e w e l -
c o m e a n y b o d y to c o m e
and talk to us about this
and w e w i l l share w i t h
them what we k n o w a n d
have discovered since
we a s k e d J e s u s C h r i s t
into our lives as Saviour
and Lord.

Sir,
H a v i n g been s h o w n
the article i n y o u r c o l -
lege magazine on the
' H i s t o r i c a l roots of reli-
g i o n ' 1 feel I must regis-
ter my total disagree-
ment w i t h a l m o s t all the
ideas put forward by M r .
V e a l l . He appears to have
limited experience of the
deep-seated origins of
religion. It i s not a s u b -
ject to be s u m m e d - U p
lightly as M r . V e a l l be-
lieves b y briefly d i s c u s -
sing a few historical oc-
currences.
W i t h o u t delving too
deeply into What | regard
as the truth i n this mat-
ter ('the truth' as O s c a r
W i l d e so rightly says 'is
rarely pure and never
simple') so I w o u l d
merely r e c o m m e n d M r .
Veall to read Bethan's

Racism
Sir,
I have just been read-
ing a copy of the recent-
l y p u b l i s h e d IC Rag M a g .
I feel I must raise m y
v o i c e in protest about
one of the a r t i c l e s i n -
c l u d e d i n it.
Surely, as 'intelligent'
students, w e s h o u l d b e
striving to break d o w n
the barriers o f racial hat-
red, exploitation a n d
prejudice that w e r e
created by our ' C o l o n i a l
Heritage'. Yet one item
in the magazine (on page
22, I believe) blatantly
sets out to i n s u l t B l a c k
People. I w o n d e r What
impression of w e so-cal-
led intellectual a n d lib-
eral w h i t e s this w i l l
leave w i t h s o m e of t h e
overseas students w h o
are studying at this c o l -
lege.

waters the
wrong roots
Sir,
I w a s m u c h a m u s e d to
read J o c k V e a l l ' s e x p o s i -
tion on the ' H i s t o r i c a l
Roots of R e l i g i o n ' . To
describe the article as
' d r i v e l ' w o u l d be pay-
ing it far too great a
c o m p l i m e n t for s u c h a
continuous flow of m i s -
conceptions. Indeed so
glaring are these m i s c o n -
ceptions that if I w e r e to
be t o l d that M r . V e a l l
p o s s e s s e d even the
smallest of b r a i n cells
I w o u l d not hesitate to
a c c u s e h i m of l i b e l . For-
tunately no one I've met
has suggested that he
has any brain at all so
I can refer to his errors
as m i s c o n c e p t i o n s .
In h i s article M r . V e a l l
places in block capitals
" R e l i g i o n is false c o n -
s c i o u s n e s s " . A t first
sight s u c h a statement
s e e m s so meaningless
that it appears to be 'im-
possible to argue for or
against s u c h a concept.
Perhaps this is his inten-
tion. H o w e v e r , in reading
the preamble to this
sweeping phrase one
finds h i m t a l k i n g of the
'fundamental c o n t r a d i c -
tions b e t w e e n m a n a n d
nature' as ' m a n w a n t i n g
to control nature but n a -
ture not w a n t i n g to be
controlled by m a n ' . T h i s
contradiction w e are t o l d
leads to the evolution of
religion. R e a l l y ?
I shall not go on as I
do not w i s h to be too c r i -
tical so I shall leave the
s u m m a r y to M r . V e a l l
himself. He refers to ' a
fantastic force outside of
his c o n t r o l ' . It seems
that he w a s aptly de-
scribing h i s o w n c a p a b i l -
ity to d i s c u s s this topic.

Petrol rationing
and RCC transport
In v i e w of the present
uncertainty regarding
petrol rationing, R . C . C .
Transport S u b - C o m m i t -
tee has d e c i d e d , if rat-
ioning is i n t r o d u c e d , t o :
a) Control the coupons
for R . C . C . vehicles,
except l . C . C . A . G ' s .
v e h i c l e W h i c h w i l l be
the responsibility of
the c o m m u n i t y ac-
t i o n group.
b) A s k every priority
c l u b to m a k e their
bookings again for
next term, g i v i n g an
order of preference
for eaCh trip and an
estimated mileage
(as accurate as pos-
sible).
c) Restrict priority clubs
to one or t w o week-
e n d s next term, de-
pending on h o w
m u c h petrol is allow-
ed per month, a n d
the distance of their
trips.
d) T r y t o ' ensure that
c l u b s use the ve-
h i c l e s a s fully as
p o s s i b l e ,
e) O n l y a l l o w other
clubs a n d private u s -
ers to use the v e h -
icles i f there are any
surplus coupons.
The a b o v e proposal®
a s s u m e that petrol rat-
ioning i s introduced o n
the system W h i c h i s at
present being prepared.
If rationing i s intro-
d u c e d i m m e d i a t e l y after
the issue of coupons i s
complete, then the t w »
tours planned for the v a -
cation w i l l have to toe

ons saved for next t e r m .
If rationing i s n ' t i m m e -
diately i n t r o d u c e d tbenr
the winter tours w i l l be
a l l o w e d to continue, tout
the users m u s t keep m
contact w i t h the news-

given out they must re-
turn to L o n d o n .
