D R A M S O C
CAMINO REAL BY
TENNESSEE
WILLIAMS
Beit Theatre (Union Concert
Hall) 5th to 8th December.
Prince Consort Road w a s filled with cars a n d
50-seater coaches, c r o w d s m i l l e d in the streets,
it is Friday night a n d D r a m s o c are about to per-
form " C a m i n o R e a l " .
P a r a g r a p h o n e o n the C a m i n o R e a l review —
lights d o w n , enter D o n Quixote a n d S a n c h o Panza
from the back of the h a l l . W e notice the stage h a s
a large extension, black cloth covers the raised
portions a n d the characters enter a n d exit via
these cioths. Obviously this is to be no ordinary
play, the audience is here to get involved, not
merely spectate. D o n Q u i x o t e enters the C a m i n o
Real, his c o m p a n i o n Sancho runs back to La
M a n c h a , Quixote sleeps . . . .
Paragraph t w o o n the C a m i n o Real review —
an ageing gentleman in white suit a n d pink b o w
tie, a M r . G u t m a n , announces B l a c k 1 on the
C a m i n o Real, he is to be our narrator, a n overseer,
s o m e o n e of s o m e importance. But let us consider
the action, the plot? A survivor c r a w l s from the
desert o n to the plaza, he turns t o w a r d s the Siete
M a r e s , despite advice to the contrary. A loud
shot rings out a n d the desperate m a n falls to the
g r o u n d , c r a w l i n g over the dried-up fountain.
J a c q u e s Casanova is appalled by these events,
there is nothing he c a n do. Gutman is n o w o n
the phone to his superior, describing the scene,
a blind girl a n d a guitar-toting dreamer assist the
survivor, but n o t for long. " T h e survivor is no
longer s u r v i v i n g " .
Paragraph three on the C a m i n o Real r e v i e w —
' K i i r o y is c o m i n g " , written in chalk o n the w a l l ,
enter a n ex-boxer born a n d bred in Texas, Y e s sir,
" K i i r o y is h e r e " . H i s heart, the size of a baby's
head, has grown weak and a pair of golden boxing
gloves draped round his neck remain as a reminder
of his glorious past. H i s wallet is stolen by street
vagrants. In typical A m e r i c a n style he stands his
ground, confronts M r . G u t m a n , w h o offers h i m a
job as a " P a t s y " — a c l o w n . Kiiroy tries to escape
h i s fate, he is caught a n d forced to wear the
c l o w n ' s mask, the flashing nose.
Paragraph four on the C a m i n o Real review —
remember the survivor, h e is carried off in a dust-
b i n by " T h e Streetcleaners", the same fate befalls
the B a r o n d e C h a r l u s u p o n h i s demise, is there a n y
escape from this . . . . this p l a c e ? O h yes, across
the desert, the nothing, nothing a n d more nothing,
to the snow-covered mountains o n the horizon.
Kiiroy is c l o w n , e n d of B l a c k 6, interval.
Paragraph five o n the C a m i n o R e a l r e v i e w —
"It's not so m u c h a play as a state of m i n d " —
It's very impressive, isn't i t " — L o o k , darling, it
says in the programme that everyone reaches the
C a m i n o Real at s o m e stage in their life, w e leave
the illusions of youth behind a n d each h a s to face
the Terra Incognita (the desert) of age in your o w n
w a y " — "I don't get i t " — " W h a t ' s it a l l a b o u t ? "
— " W h a t does it m e a n ? " — M E A N ? M E A N ?
W H A T D O E S IT M E A N ? T h e fools, do they think
they've c o m e to see " C o r o n a t i o n S t r e e t " ?
Paragraph s i x o n the C a m i n o Real r e v i e w — T h e
great lover, J a c q u e s C a s a n o v a , i s talking w i t h the
fair Marguerite, she still d w e l l s o n the anguish
of the c o m i n g of her menopause, " i t ' s always a
white flower n o w , never a p i n k " . Casanova's
thoughts are on love a n d resting o n the C a m i n o
Real, Marguerite's are o n escape. Suddenly, there
in t h e sky, that noise, getting louder, it's the u n -
scheduled flight, the Fugitivo! Chaos, people run-
ning, shouting, cases, tickets, money, papers, Cus-
toms, " q u i c k Jacques, get m y money, m y clothes,
m y papers — let m e get out — the F U G I T I V O ! " —
hurry, more chaos, noise, people running, Lord
M u l l i g a n carted off by the street cleaners, more
people running, t h e noise, the lights, the Fugitivo
leaves. Marguerite is left on the steps stranded,
«in tears, trapped. S h e no longer wants Jacques
C a s a n o v a , she leaves h i m .
Paragraph seven o n the C a m i n o Real review —
L o r d B y r o n leaves the Siete M a r e s to return to h i s
ene main devotion in life . . . . to . . . .? W h a t is
his one main devotion? Byron explains h o w his
heart is in the only instrument he s h o u l d listen to.

not rows of p a i d m u s i c i a n s ; in the background the
dreamer quietly plays, Byron walks up the staircase
to the Terra Incognita, " s o m e o n e stop h i m , w a r n
him of the desert", B y r o n is undaunted, he knows
what he is doing, he w a l k s out of C a m i n o Real
and is gone. W h a t of those that remain, they have
all paid the price of a d m i s s i o n — D E S P E R A T I O N .
T h o s e with cash in the Siete Mares, those without
either in the " R i t z — M e n O n l y " or o n the streets.
The set of the entire play is simple, but effective,
realistic. T h e Siete Mares, where the rich re-
side o n the right, the pawnbrokers a n d " P i t y — M e n
O n l y " on the left.
Paragraph eight o n the C a m i n o Real review —
it is Fiesta time, join in the fun, tonight the rising
moon will turn Esmeralda, the G y p s y ' s daughter,
into a virgin, a n d a chosen hero w i l l b e found.
Kiiroy hocks his golden gloves to finance an ex-
pedition across the desert a n d away. Casanova
wears his c r o w n of horns, oblivious to the crowd's
taunts. Hail Esmeralda, the virgin, she chooses
Kiiroy as her hero, he is torn between escape
and the temptations of the Gypsy's daughter, temp-
tation w i n s , longer interval.
Paragraph nine o n t h e C a m i n o Real review —
" L e t ' s get d o w n t o the bar before everyone e l s e " —
" W a n t a chocolate or a barley sugar, d e a r ? " " N o w
I'm beginning to understand it, the C a m i n o Real
is obviously that stage in a person's life w h e n
he (or she) has to face t h e agonising reality
of growing o l d . If one c a n accept this then they
can cross the Terra Incognita w i t h no problems.
Casanova's whole life is centred around his viri-
lity a n d as this declines with his increasing age he
c a n n o t c o m e to terms with it a n d s o is stranded
on C a m i n o Real. Similarly, K i l r o y s ' whole life
was his boxing career, w h e n his heart grew weak,
and the medics w o u l d n ' t O . K . h i m for any more
fights he too couldn't face his fate, couldn't face
old age, so he too remains o n C a m i n o Real. Lord
Byron, however, once he has accepted the minor
points of o l d age, is able to return to h i s poetry
and c a n continue writing as long as he likes, s o
he c a n blithely walk out of the place. Marguerite
dwells too m u c h on her past to be able to escape
no matter h o w m u c h she wants t o " — " W e ' d
better get back n o w , it'll be starting again s o o n " .
Paragraph ten on the C a m i n o Real review —
the Gypsy fills in the chosen hero forms for Kiiroy
and Nursie brings in Esmeralda. S h e stretches
seductively on the c o u c h , t w o small coiled green
snakes guarding her breasts. Kiiroy is too wor-
ried about the Gypsy's news that he is next on the
street cleaners list to concentrate o n the Job at
hand. H e spends a long time impressing Esme-
ralda w i t h his sincerity a n d is finally a l l o w e d
to lift her veil. H e is thrown out b y the G y p s y
and lands o n . . . . •
Paragraph eleven on the C a m i n o Real r e v i e w —
Kiiroy is o n the plaza, Gutman assists Casanova's
exit from the Siete Mares. Kilroy's heart is too
weak to carry the befriended Casanova's bag into
its n e w home, the R I T Z — M e n Only. Kiiroy de-
cides to sleep out under the stars, he is joined b y
Marguerite a n d when the street cleaners approach
he is ready for them. B u t his resistance is too
weak, a l l in vain.
Paragraph twelve on the C a m i n o Real r e v i e w —
Kilroy's body is being investigated by a dissection
class, t h e instructor removes the heart, a golden
one t h e size of a baby's head, Kiiroy grabs his
heart from the instructor a n d in trying to convince
the sleeping Esmeralda he is more t h a n a tom-
cat, pawns his heart for a collection of cheap
stones a n d furs to impress the sleeping G y p s y
daughter. H e falls to the dry fountain, broken,
screwed, robbed, desolate, a w r e c k . . . . D o n
Quixote awakes a n d washes his face, cleans his
teeth in the fresh clean water of the fountain. T h e
c r o w d of vagrants are stunned, they leap upon
the fountain as Kiiroy a n d Quixote c l i m b the stair-
case together, towards the Terra Incognita.
Paragraph thirteen on the C a m i n o Real r e v i e w —
credits: T h e production a n d direction of Denys
Bennett w a s as immaculate as " T h e C r u c i b l e "
and the general standard of acting really excellent.
A l t h o u g h not perfect, it is impossible to fault the
production, a very difficult play indeed to perform,
one w h i c h w a s tackled in a very adventurous a n d
professional manner. T h e props, costumes a n d
scenery were very realistic a n d convincing. T h e
only really outstanding individual performance w a s
that of Pat G o r m a n as Kiiroy, although Steve
Grove (Gutman) M i k e Stranger (Casanova), Penny
Pyke (Marguerite) a n d Carina Standing ( G y p s y ) ,
not forgetting Sheila Hughes (her daughter) sup-
ported very w e l l . T h e play w a s perhaps too sur-
realistic for s o m e people to enjoy o n the super-
ficial level, but choreography (by M a d e l i n e
Claque) a n d superb lighting (by A l e c M a c A n d r e w )
e n h a n c e d the entire p r o d u c t i o n to s u c h a d e g r e e
that everyone must have got something out of it.
It's a play to think about, to interpret in your o w n
way to w o r k o u t for yourself; c o n s i d e r your o w n
situation, d r a w your o w n c o n c l u s i o n s , write your
o w n review. " T h e curtain line h a s been s a i d , s o

VACANCY
The post of sabbatical editor of FELIX w i l l be-
c o m e vacant starting at the end of this term.
H o l d everything! Before y o u a l l reach for the
application forms, let m e tell y o u that it might
not exist next term, dependent on last night's
C o u n c i l decisions.
FELIX has been in deep financial water since
half term, d u e to a p e c u l i a r side-effect of the e c o -
n o m i c crises w h i c h has made firms change their
m i n d s about advertising in London student news-
papers (except Sennet).
They a l l used to get their a d s from one brokers
company w h i c h has since packed i n a l l contracts
with London student newspapers as even they
can't get a d s .
Before M i n e s Newsletter pipe up with stories of
their unrivalled financial acumen in extorting a
couple of quid's worth of a d s per fortnight off
local traders, may il state that FELIX needs over
£50 per week worth of advertising to avert large
injections of U n i o n capital.
C o u p l e d with this drop in advertising revenue
h a s been soaring newsprint costs w h i c h I feel
makes the present format of FELIX (8-page
w e e k l y ) n o longer feasible.
A n y o n e interested in helping with whatever
media project C o u n c i l decide to back to d i s s e m i -
nate news, spews a n d reviews round the College
should contact N o r m Sayles or Paul W a d s w o r t h
in the U n i o n office, either n o w or straight away
next term.
In case anyone's w o n d e r i n g w h y I'm jacking in
the student editor scene, the answer c a n be de-
d u c e d from the statement"£400 grant for m y third
year next year a n d no parental contribution avail-
a b l e " .
Ergo elk Python dixit.
A n y w a y , before a n y more Latin quotations crop
up w h i c h have to be taken c u m grano salis as they
say, this has been a really great term editing FELIX
and I'm sorry that it has to e n d in s u c h a f i d u c i a l
conflagration, b u t I have no doubt that that scrotty
moggy w i l l re-appear again next term, although in
a different hat, no doubt.

de^plume a n d real p e o p l e for articles, reviews a n d
