Have a Happy Xmas
Everyone!
G R A N T I N C R E A S E
I M M I N E N T -
A n increase in grants is about to
b e r e c o m m e n d e d i n a confidential
Government report to be drafted
soon.
A c c o r d i n g to the Daily Telegraph
this increase " w i l l not, in present
economic circumstances, approach
the 3 5 per cent increase d e m a n d e d
at the recent N U S conference in M a r -
g a t e " .
T h e level of the residual income
(at present £1400) may be raised to
£1800 o r higher. T h i s is the assess-
able income left after mortgages,
superannuation, etc.
Nothing w i l l be done about dis-
cretionary awards, or the m e a n s test,
and the Government seems constant
about what to d o with married w o m -
en's grants a n d P G awards.
S i r Brian is thought to have said
that the increase about to be offered
is about £100.
Such an increase w i l l in no w a y
bring us up to the halcyon days of
the 1 9 6 2 level a n d coupled w i t h i n -
flation of 4 0 per cent pa expected by
Christmas, a c c o r d i n g to the G u a r d i a n ,
this means that the £100 c o u l d be
w i p e d out over the Christmas vaca-
tion.
Students next term cannot afford
to be complacent about the political
and e c o n o m i c crisis, they w i l l either
be starved out of higher education by
rising prices o r the grants campaign
is fought on a higher level: that of
an alliance w i t h sections of the Trade
Union movement t o bring down the
Tories.
The D E S has refused to let stud-
ents keep their l i v i n g standards a n d
has launched attacks through the
C V E P to v i c t i m i s e students w h o take
action (rent strikes, etc.).
The rent strikes of IC next term h a s
to be fought in conjunction w i t h a l l
sections of students a n d trade union-
ists to bring d o w n the Tories a n d
their blatant contempt for students.
PURPLE PATCH
A s this i s the last patch of the
term, a n d many of y o u Will shortly
be going home, or at least away from
C o l l e g e , I w o u l d like y o u to think
about a f e w topics other than those
w h i c h directly affect your student
lives.
W h e n those of y o u w h o are lucky
enough to be going home to see your
parents a n d families, arrive there a n d
get settled in b e s i d e the nice w a r m
fire, w i t h M u m fussing over you, a n d
D a d offering to take y o u out for a
pint, please spare a thought for those
w h o cannot get home this C h r i s t m a s .
Think for a f e w moments of the for-
eign students from the C o l l e g e (al-
m o s t 1 0 0 0 ) w h o are having to spend
their vacation i n s o m e c o l d a n d dingy
bedsit in N e a s d e n , dreaming of the
C h r i s t m a s s e s i n the past w h i c h they
have spent at h o m e w i t h their parents
and families. I a m sure that none of
you w o u l d argue w i t h the fact that
the prospect of spending Christmas
alone in L o n d o n i n your little bedsit-
thinking of a l l the people w h o have
gone h o m e to their families, is not a
very w a r m i n g i d e a .
I w o u l d also like to think of your
o w n position this C h r i s t m a s . T h i n k
of h o w lucky y o u are to b e at home,
a n d h o w nice i t i s for a change to
be getting g o o d meals a n d also a
g o o d bed to sleep i n . T h i n k about
your " M i s e r a b l e " grant a n d h o w y o u
c a n only afford " O n e square m e a l
each day of the w e e k " . Then try to
imagine yourself i n the position of
someone in a b a c k w o o d town i n Viet-
n a m or the w a r ridden areas of Greece
or C h i l e . Imagine yourself as a n 18
year o l d b l a c k boy in the m i d d l e of
Rhodesia. W h a t w o u l d y o u feel l i k e
if y o u c o u l d only get one square meal
each m o n t h , o r h a d been k i c k e d o u t
of University for a d m i t t i n g that your
lecturer w a s prejudiced against y o u
for the colour of your s k i n ? I'll tell
you what y o u w o u l d feel l i k e , y o u
w o u l d probably feel very sick, a n d
w o u l d be J U S T I F I E D in thinking that
society w a s w o r k i n g against you. Y o u
w o u l d find it difficult to believe that
the students i n the Western w o r l d
were protesting at only getting £15
each week to live o n , a n d not being
able to live a life of luxury.
T h i s C h r i s t m a s whilst y o u are at
home, please spend a little time
thinking about those around the w o r l d
w h o have far les privileges than y o u ,
and yet w h o are biologically exactly
the same as y o u . Think about those
people i n Northern Ireland Who are
afraid to g o o u t after 8.0 in the even-
ing because of a fear of being i n -
volved in a terrorist g u n battle.
A s a final thought, if y o u d o not
k n o w very m u c h or d o not believe
what y o u have heard about this m a n
Jesus C h r i s t , then please s p e n d a
little time over the vacation trying to
sort out What i t is a l l about.
For those overseas students w h o
w i l l b e staying i n London over the
Christmas vacation, I w o u l d give y o u
one tip, that in many of the Churches
around the area y o u w i l l be able to
find friends w h o w i l l b e only too
happy to share their C h r i s t m a s enjoy-
ment with you. If y o u live i n the area
around College y o u w i l l find that
Saint P a u l ' s Church, O n s l o w Square,
has a very large number of students
and overseas visitors i n t h e congre-
gation w h o w o u l d be only too happy
to help y o u have an enjoyable Christ-
mas.
To each a n d every one of y o u , I
w i s h y o u a very merry C h r i s t m a s a n d
hope that those C h r i s t i a n s amongst
you w i l l pray for those in the rest of
the w o r l d less fortunate than us, a n d
that those non-Christians amongst
you Will give a little t i m e to think
about those in the rest of the w o r l d
less fortunate than u s .
See y o u a i l after C h r i s t m a s .

P.A.W.N.O.
At 6.00 p.m.on Friday evening I
did a tour of the h a l l s of residence
to collect the nomination forms for
the Imperial College Tenants A s s o -
ciation Executive Committee. I found
completed forms only i n Beit a n d
Selkirk. N o w , at 4 . 0 0 on Sunday the
situation is the same. I c a n announce
that M e s s r s . Tony Taylor a n d Digby
J a m e s are the elected representa-
tives for Beit Hall a n d M r s . A v e r i l
D e w i n g is the Representative for Sel-
kirk Hall. A s yet, the constitution that
I've prepared h a s yet to be formally
approved. Because of this I may find
it necessary to alter it slightly to e n -
able the Executive Committee to be
formed. I hope I don't have to d o this
but it w i l l a l l depend on the response
to the nomination papers during the
rest of the week.
During the last term it has been
my task (an almost thankless one)
to advertise the Union General meet-
ings. A t most of these (and there
have been six) there h a s been some
d i s c u s s i o n on the rent strike a n d the
grants campaign. However, except
for the initial decision to have a rent
strike, very f e w other agreement have
been reached. W h y ? M a i n l y because
of the lack of people present at the
meetings, w h i c h have therefore been
deemed inquorate. The quorum is at
present 3 0 0 out of a total of 4 , 0 8 6
students; a pathetically small percen-
tage. Y e t the total turn-out at the
C C U meetings has been collectively
more than the IC U G M q u o r u m .
If y o u consider that your C C U
business (and this is N O T a kick at
the C C U ' s ) i s m o r e important than
the amount of money that y o u have
i n your pockets then that is your
business. However, it i s no use b l a m -
i n g the I C U Exec for not trying to
get the grants raised if y o u , the stud-
ent b o d y , are not prepared to d o
something about it also. There are
too many people at this college w h o
jump at the c h a n c e to criticise, to talk,
to argue, but there are very f e w w h o
are w i l l i n g to a c t . It is not c r i t i c i s m ,
talking, a n d arguments that get what
w e want. W h a t is needed is action.
M a s s action that involves a s many
students as possible. T h e rent strike
is one of these, but not the only one.
This not only needs people p a r t i c i -
pating, it also means that some of
the people that do a l l the talking
must b e w i l i n g to help out with the
organisation, the leafletting, the pub-
licising, the production of posters,
etc., etc. If i t takes one person 4
hours m i n i m u m to put up posters in
all aval labile places, then it takes less
than half-an-hour for a dozen people
to do the same. Next term's rent
strike is going ahead a n d if y o u want
it to work, i f y o u really believe that
we need higher grants (and y o u must
be nuts if y o u think the present grants
system is satisfactory) then y o u must
be w i l l i n g to work for it; y o u must be
w i l l i n g to act.
The first meeting of the Imperial
College Tenants A s s o c i a t i o n w i l l be
held this week .At present the venue
isn't finalised (it w i l l , I hope, be the
U n i o n Concert Hall or M e c h . E n g .
220) but every resident w i l l be get-
ting a note to let h i m or her k n o w
where it w i l l be. Please try a n d come.
The time w i l l b e Thursday at 5.45
w h i c h I hope w i l l not c l a s h w i t h any-
thing. Please try a n d show that the
person putting up the notices about
apathy society is w r o n g about this
college.
Duplicating Machines. S o m u c h
for one of m y rare political pieces,
now for something a bit lighter.
Those of y o u w h o have h a d cause to
use the duplicating machines during
the last term may have noticed that
they are sadly lacking in various o d d
items, e.g. ink d r u m s , fuses a n d
others. A Roneo rep finally, after more
phone calls than I care to mention,
decided that he w o u l d c o m e a n d
have a look. He gave them a thorough
inspection a n d then a n estimate for
the cost of putting them back into
almost n e w condition. Needless to
say, it, is only slightly more expen-
sive to buy n e w ones. It is hoped,
therefore, that by the e n d of the
Christmas vacation w e w i l l have two
new machines plus one of the o l d
machines for less important work.
The t w o n e w ones w i l l be l o c k e d
away in the duplicating room a n d
w i l l be for limited personnel only. It
w i l l be necessary to i n s i s t that a i l
people w h o w i s h to use the n e w
machines w i l l have to attend a d e -
monstration given by someone from
Roneo. Adequate w a r n i n g will be giv-
en beforehand.
Christmas is upon us, under u s ,
around us. Soon, most of y o u w i l l be
w i n g i n g your w a y home (assuming
you c a n get petrol for your vehicle,
that the airlines get fuel for their
planes, that the train drivers don't go
on strike a n d that there i s enough
electricity to light your w a y h o m e ) .
O n c e there y o u c a n s i t d o w n t o tur-
key ( 5 0 p a lb., don't eat too much)
and a l l the t r i m m i n g s (probably 50
per cent more expensive than last
year). Y o u c a n drink yourself m e r r y
(at least 3 p more than at c o l l e g e for
each drink). W a r m yourself i n front
of the fire (I hope you've g o t enough
