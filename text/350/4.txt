UGM-HORROR SHOCK EXPOSE
A shock tactic was unveiled again
at the U G M last Thursday when a
"Jesus-freak" evangelist challenged
the quorum during the grants debate.
C l a i m i n g t o be speaking against
the substantive motion .which w o u l d
have mandated Exec to publicise a n d
hold meetings about the Grants C a m -
paign next term, M r . J . C h r i s t k n o w s -
what (31) of 12 A n g e l M e w s ,
C l o u d - c u c k o o l a n d , W 1 0 , threatened
to challenge t h e quorum at the e n d o f
his speech.
This tactic, w h i c h h a s remained in
cold storage since last term, h a s n o w
been repainted blue a n d equipped
with a shining n e w halo ( 2 5 p avail-
able from Evangelical A c c e s s o r i e s
Ltd., M i l e E n d 'Road, haloes, sepul-
chres, jackboots a n d other Nazi relics,
callers w e l c o m e ) .
C a l l i n g h i m s e l f " t h e v o i c e of t h e
silent majority", M r . Christwbatabore
had calculated the meeting to b e i n -
quorate a n d therefore not represent-
ative of IC students.
" T h i s in no w a y invalidates o u r
firm belief that a n y decision passed
at a U G M quorate or not, i s unrepre-
sentative unless voted f o r b y over
half the registered s t u d e n t s " , h e
continued.
He a d d e d : " i n t h e unlikely event
of such a thing happening, w e w o u l d
of course consider it unrepresenta-
tive of t h e m a s s of the student b o d y
in this country, etc., etc.".
T H U N D E R B O L T S
Despite M r . C h r i s t k n o w s m y m o t h e r -
andbeknowsherbloodywell's Chal-
lenge, N o r m Sayles rallied valiantly
for about 3 0 seconds, c l a i m i n g that
a challenge t o t h e q u o r u m does not
constitute a speech against, t h e s u d -
den c r a s h of thunderbolts a n d t h e
mysterious appearance of a flaming
bush o n t h e stage w h i s p e r i n g i n a
deep voice, " q u o r u m , a l r e a d y " made
him accept the challenge a n d declare
the meeting Closed.
'However, before M r . Christ's pec-
uliarly t i m e d challenge ( M r . C h r i s t
is a director of " N o - n a i l C r u c i f i x e s "
Ltd., Kidderminster) a m o t i o n , hor-
ribly unrepresentative of t h e vast
mass of sensible students, h a d de-
clared I C ' s condemnation of the
military coup in C h i l e a n d given a n
enormous s u m of money (believed to
be about 0 . 3 per cent of t h e U n i o n ' s
funds) to a committee f o r rescuing
ultra-marxist refugees a n d peasants
from the junta's justified a n d proper
torture, random execution a n d pau-
perisation programme.
A n attempt t o amend t h e motion
was made b y Pete Lambert w h o
claimed that t h e policies of Allende,
w h i c h h a d led t o the coup, w e r e
identical to those of t h e C o m m u n i s t
Party in this country a n d that a con-
demnation of t h e idealist nature of
the so-called " p e a c e f u l road to
s o c i a l i s m " w a s needed.
SOLIDARITY
This w a s spoken against by a M r .
J o h n Lane of the C P G B ( S ) , one time
president of I C U , Who claimed that
the vast majority o f Students were
not 'interested in t h e testing of the
various theoretical roads t o a solution
of students' problems in practice.
He c l a i m e d " s o l i d a r i t y " w a s w h a t
was needed n o w a n d offered to start
an " A d - h o c committee for the laying
of wreaths o n t h e tombs of dead
S t a l i n i s t s " .
This w a s a m e n d e d b y M r . J o c k
Veall (squatter, of no fixed abode)
w h o suggested the convening of a
" P o p u l a r Front against popular front-
i s m " a n d offered to send out invita-
tions to H . W i l s o n , Len Murray, J o h n
Gollan, T . Cliff, Gery Lawless of
M I 5 , t h e A r c h b i s h o p o f Canterbury
and a n y other parties interested in
the selling out of the working class.
T E A - C U P S
There w a s m u c h d i s c u s s i o n o n the
meaning of the w o r d solidarity, b u t
Piers C o r b y n ( R e d W e a k l y seller o f
28 J a y M e w s a n d revolutionary dilet-
tante) expained " s o l i d a r i t y w i t h t h e
m i n e r s " a s meaning giving them cups
of tea a n d holding h a n d s on picket
lines, h o w e v e r " s o l i d a r i t y w i t h t h e
Chilean w o r k i n g c l a s s " clearly re-
quires a different strategy, due to the
tea getting c o l d after being sent
8 , 0 0 0 miles, namely t h e sending of
messages of support and the donation
of m o n e y , both to be intercepted b y
the military j u n t a — b u t i t ' s the
thought that counts!
The idea of solidarity meaning
unity i n action, w i t h a l l sections of
the working class brought into c o n -
flict w i t h this Government over t h e
questions of inflation a n d the defence
of democratic rights, to remove the
Tories, w a s d i s m i s s e d by these s o -
called revolutionaries as " c o r r e c t "
and " t h e only w a y f o r w a r d " a n d
therefore t o b e fought against, in the
interests of the bourgeoisie.
NO J O K E
However this is no laughing matter,
for as the capitalist system enters a
worldwide period of recession as it
is today, hightened by the "oil crisis"
the building of a revolutionary party
based on a firm bedrock of marxist
principles becomes the paramount
question for students, trade unionists
and professional workers everywhere.
Whitelaw has been brought back
from Ireland to spearhead a series of
Tory attacks and provocations on the
working class.
He has been well trained in all the
skills of military rule, not least of
which has been the experience of
dealing with the reformist SDLP
leaders in Ulster.
NATIONALIST
He will cajole and threaten the
labour leaders in this country into
selling out every struggle of the work-
ing class in the coming period.
Shaping up very fast at the mom-
ent is the likelihood of a "nationalist"
coalition government composed of
the Tory party. Prentice, Jenkins.
Shirley Williams and other Labour
Party right-wingers.
A "red scare" will be made with
which to frighten the confused middle
class into permitting the full scale
use of police and army suppression
of the working class.
As this crisis deepens daily that is
the vista which is opening up befor»
our eyes.
A vista of unemployment, poverty,
police and army brutality that, as one
Wall Street financier put it, "wiH
make the 30's seem like a summer
holiday".
Unless, that is, the working class
takes the power and establishes soci-
alism, a planned economy, and the
systematic removal of poverty which
is concomitant with such an increase
in the productive forces.
Chile isn't just a small "banana
republic" thousands of miles away,
Chile is capitalism, Chile is inflation,
Chile is here in this country. It's no
coincidence that the Telegraph talks
about a "Chilean solution may have tm
be found if the miners don't back
down", when we have all the econ-
omic problems here fast approaching
Chilean standards that produced
Allende, that produced the junta and
will be our future unless we build the
Workers Revolutionary Party and the
Young Socialist Student Society right
away. Editor.
APOLOGY
The Editor w i s h e s t o apologise f o r having sug-
gested in last T h u r s d a y ' s U G M that three of t h e
military l e a d e r s — P r e s i d e n t A l l e n d e of C h i l e , i n -
vited into h i s cabinet shortly before t h e coup
later emerged a s leaders of the military junta
w h i c h overthrew h i m .
In fact i t w a s (only) t w o . B u t s o m e h o w I feel
that t o m a k e s u c h a c o r r e c t i o n , in the interests of
historical veracity, w a s not t h e motives behind
the oalls of " l i a r ! r u b b i s h ! " that sprang from
the l i p s of arch-Stalinists J o h n Lane a n d Renato
Ezban o n hearing t h e aforementioned inaccuracy.

A v i d followers of t h e
thrill-packed Felix theo-
logical debate must find
it h a r d to believe that (in
recent years) t h e m a i n
trend i n t h e relations b e -
tween M a r x i s t s a n d
Christians h a s been to-
w a r d s dialogue.
'Since Karl M a r x ' s
famous " o p i u m of t h e
p e o p l e " phrase h a s been
mentioned let u s exam-
ine it in context.
" R e l i g i o u s suffering is
the expression o f real
suffering a n d at the
same t i m e t h e protest
against real suffering.
Religion is t h e sigh of
the oppressed creature,
the heart of a heartless
w o r l d , as it i s the spirit
of spiritless conditions.
It is t h e o p i u m of t h e
p e o p l e " .
Even this is only part
of t h e picture. Angela
Davis h a s pointed o u t
that w h i l e Christianity
was used to justify slav-
ery in t h e Southern
States, to slave a s w e l l
as master, it also i n -
spired t h e revolt o f t h e
slaves. A similar dicho-
tomy h a s appeared i n
countless peasant revolts
in Europe. A n d today,
the most respected
Christians are surely
those such a s t h e S p a n -
ish worker-priests o r
the Latin A m e r i c a n priest
and guerilla leader, Tor-
res, w h o have sacrificed
their freedom, comfort,
and even lives t o fight
oppression. Throughout
its history " C h r i s t i a n i t y "
has contained t w o reli-
gions. O n e , usually the
dominant, h a s justified
oppression a n d encour-
aged passivity, accept-
ance of one's place, d o -
gooding. T h e other h a s
inspired revolt. A n
attack o n a l l C h r i s t i a n s
is, therefore, not very
smart.
Unfortunately t h e
most vociferous spokes-
men f o r Christianity i n
IC belong to a third
trend, the evangelists.
Although hostile t o the
established C h u r c h , they
are if anything m o r e re-
actionary. T h e evangel-
ist believes h e has found
G o d , that this makes
him a better person, a n d
that h i s life should b e
spent telling people h o w
to " t u r n o n to J e s u s " .
Eventually, w h e n every-
one has been converted
w e w i l l a l l b e " g o o d "
and then, a n d only then,
can the w o r l d ' s prob-
lems b e solved. M e a n -
while such irritations as
mass starvation, fascist
states a n d exploitation
are of minor importance
compared t o t h e burning
issue of m a k i n g the next
convert. I believe this
attitude is arrogant, ego-
tistical, anti-human a n d
selfish, i n fact, surely,
a nti-Christian?
The question remains:
is M a r x i s t h u m a n i s m a
better basis for h u m a n
advance than even t h e
most progressive Christ-
ianity?
That c a n only really
be proved in practice, as
those many C h r i s t i a n s
who g o beyond charit-
able " f i r s t - a i d " work in
society a n d try t o fight
the root cause of poverty
and injustice, have real-
ised. In c o n c l u s i o n , the
incomprehen'ding theo-
logical battle i n Felix is
a waste o f time. B u t i f
there a r e C h r i s t i a n s in
IC w h o feel that a genu-
ine Communis'tjChristian
dialogue w o u l d be
worthwhile, i t ' s easy to
contact m e ,
J o h n Lane.
Public debate
challenge
Sir,
I, too, a m f e d up w i t h
this " r e l i g i o n " controv-
ersy w h i c h h a s filled
space in your paper over
the past few weeks; a n d
to e n d it I challenge M r .
Veall to state h i s v i e w s
at a public debate on the
matter. I a m prepared t o
organise a n d publicise
such a n event, at w h i c h
a fair indication of t h e
interest of students w i l l
be gained from the n u m -
ber w h o attend. Having
made these contentious
claims, M r . V e a l l s h o u l d
either defend them i n
public or stop w r i t i n g
these articles, as h e i s
only h i d i n g behind the
impersonality of t h e
press. In any case, Felix
readers w i l l have a rest.
If M r . Veall i s g o o d
enough to contact m e
we c a n discuss arrange-
ments.
