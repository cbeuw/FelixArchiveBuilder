THE REIGN OF PEACE
O Irish friends across the sea,
W e differ still, but let's agree
T o end the chilling past that's gone.
C a n you forgive, forget, march on,
So wars, like snakes, are no more seen
Across the bitter, blood-stained green?
Let love now melt the shearing edge
Of frozen faith's dividing wedge.
H o w great was Peter's faith, and fear,
In slashing.off the soldiers' ear;
Though Christ, so boundlessly humane,
Then healed it on and stopped the pain.
Pray parted Irish eyes transmit
The scene each side can see to fit
A s single sight within the mind,
A n d blind-spots see by sight combined.
M a y each hibernal, Christian light
Let insight calm the Pyrrhic night.
W h e n motes impede our sight it seems
E a c h other's church has many beams.
What rainbow spans your haunted isle
F r o m Larne to far Killarney while
M e n echo one another's prayer
Then fight within the faith they share?
" O u r Father . . ." pray, " T h y will be done
D i d Jesus ever use a gun?
" G i v e us this day our daily bread . . . "
They've shot another human dead.
"Deliver us from e v i l " . . . now
A n d end this God-forsaken row.
I dream that Jesus lives again
A n d cries aloud for peace to reign!
Then all of Ireland's risen slain
Return and walk where they have lain,
T o dampen hate, extinguish pain,
With tears that fall with Irish rain.
N» Racine-Jaques, 1973
"The Reign of P e a c e " was published in
the magazine " Y o u n g Q u a k e r " last year,
with the omission of the s e c o n d stanza:
Advice has come our way, you see,
F r o m those who chant the liturgy,
" T h e second stanza has to go,"
God's censors whispered to us: " N o ,
i Rephrase it in another way,
But don't offend the I R A . "

Why did your hair turn
Black
Overnight ?
I saw you get pissed on Saturday
In the bar,
A n d do a Zumba.
Keith's M u m says
if she'd been there
She would have poured
A pint of Tartan on
Your balls.

Adventures in the
Union Quadrangle:
On Saturday, December the first, an amaz-
ing and unprecedented event took place in the
U n i o n Quadrangle. A t about ten to midnight,
s o m e people w i t h left-wing views on free speech
attacked people taking part in a sing-song.
T h i s came to happen in the following way:
there w a s a meeting of left-orientated people in
the U n i o n Lower Refectory on Saturday afternoon
and evening, and m a n y of t h o s e present stayed
afterwards for a drink in the Lower Lounge. K n o w -
ing S o c . S a c ' s views, people in the bar d e c i d e d
to have a bit of fun by holding the Saturday night
sing-song in the Lower Lounge. T h i s w a s a suc-
cess, perhaps due to the better acoustics of the
lounge, and a g o o d time was h a d by all, until at
eleven o'clock they retired to the bar for a final
pinta. The sing-song continued there, until they
were c h u c k e d out, w h e n it moved to the Q u a d .
V a r i o u s songs were sung, a n d finally they sang
the bar version of 'The Red F l a g ' .
A t this, members of S o c . S o c , w h o felt that a
song w h i c h had great significance to them w a s
being m o c k e d , emerged from the Lounge equipped
with bottles, and attacked some of the singers.
Seeing that an unequal fight, w t h only, one possible
outcome, was on the cards, some members of the
Rugby C l u b attempted to restore order by pulling
apart those w h o w e r e fighting. T o do so, they
had to hold one of their members, w e l l k n o w n
for h i s ability in a fight, to the floor. A t this the.
person w i t h w h o m he h a d been fighting k i c k e d
him in the face.
This made the singers realise that S o c . S o c .
really w a n t e d a fight, so they rapidly took them
apart, and drove them out of the Q u a d . Y o u m a y
be pleased to hear that the person k i c k e d i n the
face is all right, apart from, a broken tooth, a n d
that the kicker received his just reward.

"The place of cars in
Society3
It defeats me h o w there are so many students
to W h o m Touchstone is a complete mystery. One
of those events w h i c h you see posters for, but still
haven't any idea what it's a l l about. M a y b e this
article w i l l help clarify things.
Touchstone i s , basically, a d i s c u s s i o n weekend,
though it has many other g o o d points besides
that. It starts off, soon after you arrive with a
talk given by the guest speaker, who is usually
of high renown in his subject. This lasts roughly
an hour, and i s followed by an open forum in
w h i c h y o u can fire questions at him on any queries
arising.
After dinner groups of half a dozen or more
are formed; and once a chairman and scribe is
elected you can discuss-cum-argue over some set
questions either until you've said your lot, you're
blue in the face, or bed, bar or snooker takes its
toll.
Next morning, after breakfast you can do as
you please (except stay in bed), though person-
ally, nothing short of a monsoon w o u l d keep
me f r o m a walk in nearby W i n d s o r Great Park,
w h i c h i s beautiful at all times of year. If you go
in winter though, b e w a r e of V i r g i n i a Water, as
the ice may not be as sturdy as it seems. Indeed
it c l a i m e d two of our party (me included) When
w e tried to make our way across one of the
narrower parts. A l s o to enable you to return in
time for lunch maps are issued, and are quite
useful.
T o round off w i t h , everyone congregates in the
afternoon' and results of the previous night's dis-
cussion are compared (hence the necessity of
seribes), w i t h the speaker giving h i s point of view,
he having; the advantage of knowing the questions
by the w e e k e n d .
People w h o have already been to a Touchstone
weekend may have noticed that I have so far
avoided the subject of food. This is by no means
because it is below par. Quite the contrary i n fact.
It cannot fail to satisfy, gourmets a n d gannets
alike, a n d even the water tastes nicer over there,
from the Institute for Transport Studies, Univer-
sity of Leeds, a n d the topic under examination
w a s " T h e Place of Cars to S o c i e t y " . Peter H i l l s
was very involved in the Buchanan Report a n d
this didi, inevitably, enter h i s talk. B a s i c a l l y it c o n -
cern's, the problem of traffic in urban districts, a n d
various m e t h o d s concerning this problem w e r e
d i s c u s s e d . One of the most interesting ideas, I
thought, was the i n c l u s i o n of a black box in every
car, a n d theoretically technology w o u l d enable
this, device to register at a faster rate in city
centres than in the country. W i t h road tax based
on this, it w o u l d hopefully, act as a restraint on
car usage both because it w o u l d cost m o r e to
travel i n city centres a n d also the driver w o u l d
be constantly reminded of how m u c h he is spend-
ing.
The first two of the questions involved the per-
sonal freedom of the individual to purchase and
operate his o w n car, a n d to What extent should
laws protect third parties, passengers, and drivers
themselves. It it w a s generally agreed that indi-
viduals should not be prevented from b u y i n g cars,
though restraints s h o u l d be laid d o w n w h e n the
safety or rights of others i s concerned, i.e. pro-
tect the innocent f r o m the foolhardy, but not the
foolhardy from themselves, as it is comparable
to things like ski-ing and mountain-climbing. Thus
seat belts s h o u l d not be enforced though preven-
tion o f drunken driving and speeding s h o u l d .
For the third question it w a s d e c i d e d that the
tax distribution for different modes of transport
was not equitable or truly reflective of s o c i a l
costs that each impose on the community, and
public transport s h o u l d be competitive w i t h pri-
vate transport with the intention of reducing traf-
fic congestion. T h i s led to number four: that the
values associated w i t h city centres should be
conserved even if it restrains private car usage,
in those centres.
The last two questions were both technological,
concerning a replacement for the automobile, a n d
the threat of the continued exploitation of crude
oil' to the natural ecosystem, though nobody
seemed really qualified to answer these with m u c h
accuracy.
