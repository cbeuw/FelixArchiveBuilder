There w e w e r e last
S u n d a y week h u d d l e d in
our seats, the stage w a s
in pitch black. T h e r e d
lights from eager a m p l i -
fiers pierced the gloomy
blackness, dark s h a d o w s
m o v e d s o l e m n l y about
as the opening strains of
" P i n b a l l W i z a r d " cried
o u t into t h e merciless
air. It soared and surged,
to its inevitable c l i m a x
and w e awaited the mas-
sive bass notes, it drew
closer a n d closer a n d
finally — K E R S P L U N G !
" . . . W e l c o m e to the
show, folks, w e l c o m e to
the show. W e hope that
we w i l l a l l be friends be-
fore it's time to g o " .
There stood the nine
members of G r i m m s
adorned in c l o w n hats
and ruffs a n d w e knew
w e were in for a rare
treat — w e w e r e indeed.
G r i m m s really defy des-
cription. Y o u c o u l d call
them a rock band, a
group of poets, a set of
c l o w n s or c o m e d i a n s ;
you c o u l d , but to do so
w o u l d be inaccurate.
They are a l l this a n d
more, they are a n atmo-
sphere, a feeling, a ray
of hope in this God-for-
saken planet w e call
home.
G r i m m s are entertain-
ing, n o w that's a w o r d
you can't u s e about
many groups. They are
pure, complete a n d abso-
lute entertainment, never
predictable, never ever
boring a n d absolutely a
joy to watch. O n t h e
musical side the hon-
ours go to Neil Innes
and A n d y Roberts. Neil
is an unrecognised
genius, he c a n play his
guitar very competently
and his various key-
boards superbly; he c a n
write and act in a totally
original way. W h o c o u l d
resist h i m as he sat a l l
alone on stage, playing
piano w h i l s t he sang the
title song from his latest
solo a l b u m " H o w sweet
to be a n i d i o t " . A n d y
Roberts is a virtuoso
acoustic a n d electric
guitar player, together
with Neil a n d Zoot
M o n e y h e h o l d s t h e m u -
sical side of the a c t to-
gether a n d writes some
amazingly good m u s i c
that w o u l d easily stand
up on its o w n in a pure
rock context. T h e
rockin'. ' n ' h o p i n ' Zoot
M o n e y w a s surprisingly
sudued in the first half
of the s h o w , but treated
us to some tasty toons
in the second half a n d is
also a very visual per-
former w h e n he gets
going. A s well as the
music, there's the poetry
and no one c a n doubt
Roger M c G o u g h ' s tal-
ents in this field. H i s
works are a delight to
listen to, the short cryp-
tic remarks, the delibe-
rately corny puns, the
w o r d plays and long love
stories a l l read out in h i s
very sophisticated m a n -
ner, it's sheer poetry. If
you like Brian Patten's
very individualistic style
of writing and voice then
his poetry, although very
imaginative a n d hard to
understand, as read by
him the w a y it w a s in
tended is totally capti-
vating. O n a couple of
o c c a s i o n s the poems
were read over suitable
musical backgrounds,
M c G o u g h ' s " V a m p i r e "
and Patten's " P r o p h e t "
for example, a n d it
w o r k e d so very w e l l that
one w o n d e r s just w h y
G r i m m s is the only
music-poetry group to
come to public notice.
But as well as the
m u s i c a n d the poetry,
there is the c o m e d y a n d
here J o h n G o r m a n , a
natural c o m e d i a n if ever
there w a s one, comes to

About t w o years ago
a group of IC students
felt that they had heard
enough of the problems
of pollution, resource de-
pletion a n d population
growth to be c o n v i n c e d
that these are real. W i t h -
out denying the need for
further d i s c u s s i o n s , poli-
tical action a n d so o n ,
this group d e c i d e d to
provide a series of acti-
vities w h i c h w o u l d en-
able members to involve
themselves in imple-
menting some of tneir
ideas both to demon-
strate their o w n convic-
tions a n d to bring these
ideas to the attention of
others. Tnese activities
have been numerous a n d
widespread, but the
iongest - standing has
been the " C o m p u t e r
Paper Re-cycling C a m -
p a i g n " . T h e waste of
tons of computer print-
out has struck many
activist groups in other
colleges as worthy of
. e n . on, but no other
c o l l e g e c a n c l a i m , a s far
a -e know, anything ap-
.roacning the success
achieved by IC E c o -
.ct.on.
The c a m p a i g n , launch-
ed in January 1 9 7 2 after
Taking the T
out of re'f'use
l e g : Administration
Heads of Departments,
etc., w a s based on the
provision of boxes in a l l
departments into w h i c h
anyone could discard
unwanted print-out a n d
cards. These boxes were
emptied periodically a n d
the paper stored in a
small room kindly pro-
vided for the purpose by
the Domestic Bursar.
W h e n a suitable quan-
tity (about 1 to 2 tons)
had been thus a c c u m u -
dated, it w a s removed
by a charity — Re-
reach into C h i l d B l i n d -
ness — w h i c h specia-
lises in fund-raising by
selling computer waste
for re-cycling. D u r i n g
nearly t w o years of ope-
ration, the group collect-
ed about 3 5 tons of
paper in the following
categories:
computer print-out
.25}- tons w c t h approx.
£510
computer cards
7 tons wortl'i approx.
£210
Phone books, journals,
etc.
2\ tons worth approx.
£20.
Note that these prices
are roughly those paid
by paper dealers if they
collect from source; if
the paper is delivered to
the dealers, the prices
are significantly higher.
There is also a related
saving to the c o m m u n i t y
as the London rate-payer
has to pay £6 to £10 for
the collection a n d dis-
posal of every ton of re-
fuse.
The long-term a i m of
the campaign w a s to
demonstrate to the C o l -
lege authorities the f i -
nancial viability of the
scheme a n d to this e n d
a detailed report w a s
submitted to trie Rector,
the Secretary and the F i -
nancial Secretary in M a y
1 9 7 2 . This report, not-
ing that College e m -
ployees have already
to move refuse from
source to collection
po.nt s h o w e d than an an-
nual income of up to
£2,000 c o u l d be gene-
rated with a m i n i m u m of
segregation. T a l k s con-
tinued for well over a
year until finally, last
month, ' the College
agreed to take over the
whole scheme (cutting
out R I C B , of c o u r s e ) . T o
give them a start, the
group presented the C o l -
lege with 3 tons of c o m -
puter waste w h i c h w a s
recently sold for over
£70.
The full implementa-
tion of the scheme is de-
pendent on Westminster
C o u n c i l ' s installation of
a general waste c o m -
pressor — a Dumpster
in M e c h . Eng., similar to
that at present operating
in South Side. O n c e
this is done, the s m a l l
brick b u i l d i n g in the
East Court c a n be used
as a paper store. There
may also be problems
w i t h N U P E to be ironed
out. In the meantime,
anyone with a large
quantity of easily
handled paper waste
should inform M r . Brack-
ing of Supplies — Int.

The exploits of the
Incomparable
Mwlla Nasrndin
by Idries Shah
Picador 40p
BOOK
One of the basic tenets of t h e M u s l i m religion
is that there is no absolute reality but G o d , but
the only doctrine to take this t o its logical c o n c l u -
sion is S u f i s m . In his book, "The S u f i s " , Idries
S h a h has introduced the Dervishes a n d their philo-
sophy: the central figure in a series of medieval
jokes used to illustrate the teachings of S u f i s m
w a s M u l l a N a s r u d i n .
In this series of tales, N a s r u d i n takes the part
of teacher, fool, beggar or physician, yet always
manages to exhibit the aerobatic contortions to
w h i c h the human m i n d is prone. O n this level,
then, this is a serious book, but o n another plane
it is also wholly a n d hilariously funny. Here is
the home ground of the Goons a n d M o n t y Python,
and the origin of many chestnuts of the M u s i c
H a l l :
" N a s r u d i n s ' wife ran to his room w h e n s h e
heard a tremendous thump.
Nothing to worry about,' said the M u l l a , 'it w a s
only m y cloak w h i c h fell to the ground'.
'What, a n d made a noise like t h a t ? '
'Yes, I w a s inside it at the time.' ".
" N a s r u d i n w a s throwing handfuls of crumbs
around his house.
' W h a t are y o u d o i n g ? ' someone asked h i m .
'Keeping the tigers away'. ( cont. page 5"
