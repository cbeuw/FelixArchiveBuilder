Loop da Loop Loop da Loop
'Miracle Maker'
(Manifesto) 3
Nice enough follow-up to the Top 20 success of 'Hazel', this sin-
gle sees Loop da Loop stick to what he knows best - breakbeat
driven house music with infectious lyrics. It also sees him re-estab-
lish his links with M C Duke, who featured on Loop da Loop's debut
'Go With Tha Flow' back in '97. funny I should mention that sin-
gle, 'cos that really was a corker, and showed all the qualities that
this one tends to lack.
'Miracle Maker' never quite makes it off the ground, falling in
between the sound of 'Go With Tha Flow' and a more purely big
beat influenced track. It may be getting caned by Fatboy Slim and
some other cheesier exponents of big beat, but that isn't neces-
sarily a good sign, now is it? To be honest pogoing around just
isn't for me, and that's the only thing you could do to this record.

The First Album'
(Cross Section) 4
The first mix album from this independent record label, it is a com-
bination of very daring and experimental slow techno and deep
house. These aren't the kind of mainstream tracks that everyone
talks about, but the kind that will send the dancefloor wild whilst
still remaining anonymous. The album includes the filtered disco
anthem 'I Know' from Tim Deluxe before moving onto the tech-
house killer 'Daylight'. And this is really the story of the album -
lots of variation and plenty of new ideas and with each track being
something completely different you are left in anticipation of what's
coming up next.
