I
f you haven't seen this film already,
then lets face it you should have.
However, Its recent re-release will
help rectify any tragic mistake you
might have made. O f course, finding
a cinema cool enough to let you
indulge In this classic may prove diffi-
cult at first, but as you will soon dis-
cover, the reward is worth the search.
This is a film best seen o n the big
screen if you wish to discover why it
has so often been credited with the
title of 'best movie ever made'. As far
as Hollywood is concerned. Citizen
Kane epitomises all that a great film
should be. The story flows well, hold-
ing your interest from start to finish.
Beautifully photographed, it is o n e of
the first films to make use of deep
focus, allowing the viewer a new kind
of realism that helped set the mould in
which most modern movies are made.
Having said that, most people watch
modern movies and so this offering will
come as nothing new to them. Only
boting, film fanatics would truly want to
appreciate it for its revolutionary style.
The majority of folk will enjoy for what
it really is; a well made film of moral
telling.
Allegedly based on the real life
Classic cinema. Mmmm.
story of media monster, William Ran-
dolph Hearst, it is still as relevant today
as it always was. Kane himself repre-
sents anyone you care to satirise, while
the remaining screen time is devoted
to the usual love interests and grip-
ping dialogue you will have come to
expect when you hear the word 'clas-
sic'. Shot from low angles and with
similarly low lighting, there is much to
be recognised in the recent revival of
Film Noir found in contemporary cin-
ema. Its re-release serves as a strong
reminder of where so many films got
their ideas.
Definitely worth a look if you
haven't seen it already, if only to make
you a mote cultured individual. Don't
expect this film to blow your head off,
that's not what it's intended to do.
What it does is establish itself as the
template for nearly all modern Holly-
wood pictures, making it o n e of the
most important films you are ever likely
to see as opposed to the most exciting.
While not the roller coaster ride it is
often painted out to be, it is a good
film, undeniably so, and at least worthy
of the mere two hours it will take from
your free time. Q
