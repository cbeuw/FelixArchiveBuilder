Mish-Mash Mess
Dear Felix,
I read M r Mish-Mash's c o l u m n with inter-
est a n d not a little incredulity last w e e k
[Issue 1147]. I w i s h I w a s taking t h e stats
exam that he described. It's reassuring to
know that there is a help system available
in t h e e x a m , but I assure our dear Kev
that if he only h a d half a n hour to c o m -
plete the four stats tests required, h e
might feel just a little bit pressed f o r
time. Perhaps t h e r e a s o n 'so m a n y
w a n n a b e doctors failed' Is t h e fact that
they are selected t o deal with p e o p l e ,
rather than with machines like t h e major-
ity o f IC.
M o s t o f t h e first year m e d i c s I k n o w
harbour n o ill t h o u g h t s or prejudices
towards other IC students. I find Kevin's
c o l u m n d e e p l y upsetting a n d very n e g -
ative. W e (as first years) find ourselves in
a very a w k w a r d position. O n t h e o n e
hand w e have older m e d i c s telling us to
stick to m e d i c tradition, a n d o n t h e other
w h e n w e try to integrate with IC w e are
accused o f b e i n g "arrogant" by s n i d e
dickheads such as our friend Kevin. If ICU
w a n t m e d i c s to b e fully integrated into
their u n i o n (less "independent"), then I
suggest that this outdated attitude is rel-
e g a t e d t o t h e scrap h e a p w h e r e it
b e l o n g s in time for next years freshers!
A First Year M e d i c
M r Dear Furry Friend,
Why d i d y o u devote half a page in t h e
last Issue t o s o m e o n e w h o by his o w n
a d m i s s i o n , k n o w s n o t h i n g about noth-
ing? I'm not taking issue with his views
a b o u t t h e a c a d e m i c ability required to
pass t h e first year medical statistics exam;
I t o o , consider It s o m e w h a t farcical. H e
might have l o o k e d for a m o r e original
perspective o n it t h o u g h , don't you think,
rather than implicity putting the w h o l e
t h i n g d o w n to s o m e sort o f iniquitous
treatment for those o f us in the BMS. Not
totally unrelated is t h e slight in t h e s a m e
article o n t h e medical lecturer w h o w a s
broadcast to t h e biologists in t h e n e i g h -
b o u r i n g lecture theatre. Hardly his fault,
but o f course, h e w a s a doctor a n d so fair
game... or w a s he? Well, never m i n d ,
that's just factual accuracy a n d N O B O D Y
cares a b o u t that...
Yours,
Idris H a r d i n g
Fair comment, but Kevin's cynicism Is
not solely directed at medics - ICU and
College have both come under criticism.
As for the last point, I think It was his
continuation of the lecture, rather than
the technical problems themselves,
which was the object of Kevin's
slight dig. -Ed
Fair Pay and Fair Grants
Dear Felix,
I w o n d e r w h e t h e r "2nd yr b i o under-
grad" (Felix 1147) has taken part in a n y
activity t o d e f e n d t h e student grant a n d
o p p o s e t h e introduction o f fees. If s/he
had, they w o u l d surely k n o w that lectur-
ers h a v e s h o w n great interest in t h e
f u n d i n g d e b a t e a n d have i n d e e d
" s h o w e d solidarity to students over t h e
tuition fees issue."
W h e n tuition fees w e r e first floated
as a possibility by LSE, IC A U T sent a let-
ter o f support to a student c o n f e r e n c e
held to o p p o s e their introduction. Nation-
ally, A U T s u b m i t t e d a well thought out
alternative t o t h e current f u n d i n g sys-
t e m w h i c h c a n b e read on-line at
http://www.aut.org.uk. I have b e e n o n
every national student d e m o n s t r a t i o n
since 1993 a n d there are always local A U T
a n d NATFHE banners flying. W h e n iCU
Labour C l u b o r g a n i s e d a d e b a t e o n
tuition fees last year, IC A U T m e m b e r s
attended a n d v o i c e d their opposition t o
fees, r e m i n d i n g us that A U T has l o b b i e d
parliament against t h e m .
Please, please, stop trying t o turn
the issue into 'Lecturers v Students' a n d
let's stand together: Fair Pay for Staff, Fair
Grants for Students, as t h e placard dis-
played o n t h e front p a g e o f last w e e k ' s

Rythmes all Wrong
Hello,
Sorry to b e sad a n d pedantic (typical IC
postgrad then ;-)), but I couldn't help
noticing t h e m i n o r clanger your music
reviewer d r o p p e d in issue 1147. 'Les
Rythmes Digitales1
are (I thought) well
k n o w n not to be french. 'Jaques Lu Cont'
(work out w h a t that translates as your-
selves....) actually c o m e s f r o m that well
k n o w n gallic metropolis o f Reading. I
take it s o m e o n e wasn't d o i n g their
h o m e w o r k .
O n a n entirely s a d a n d p e d a n t i c
point (cribbed f r o m last year's m u d
encrusted official Glastonbury guide), if
they w e r e French they w o u l d b e called
'Les Rythmes Digitaux' instead.
Yours anorakly,
Rob Leah

Can I be really anal a n d point out that t h e
chap b e h i n d Les Rhythmes Digitales is
English not French? H e c o m e s f r o m
Reading, alledgedly.
Please, such language...

Interestingly enough, I saw them at
Homelands ten days ago, and their lead
resembled one of Felix's clubscene
editors. Very good group, I thought. - Ed
No Butts, Please
Dear Felix,
N o w that's s u m m e r is here I don't feel
like sitting in an ashtray. The Q u e e n ' s
lawn is rapidly b e c o m i n g o n e t h o u g h .
N o longer a pleasant place to c o m e sit
a n d chat, or to enjoy a bottle o f Evian,
because of smokers. Before they take u p
there position o n t h e crucifix as martyrs
to liberty o f t h e individual I'm not want-
i n g a b a n o n s m o k i n g o n t h e l a w n ,
a l t h o u g h it w o u l d m a k e it e v e n m o r e
enjoyable.
I hate t h e fact that this pack of puff-
ing pillocks after d r a g g i n g o n their nico-
tine sticks drop their butt's o n t h e grass.
This m a k e s t h e lawn a messy a n d ugly
place to sit. There s h o u l d be a fine,
preferably £5 per butt per s m o k e r o n lit-
tering. The m o n e y could g o towards free
beverage for t h e next exhilarating M a n
Utd g a m e , w h e n they g o o n to dominate
another s e a s o n o f football.
Before t h e s m o k e r s say, w h a t about
the p e o p l e with their crisp packets a n d
c h e w i n g g u m , t h e y also s h o u l d b e
finned, but as yet t h e f a g butt's out n u m -
ber a n y other rubbish 10 t o 1.
I h o p e t o s e e a cleaner Q u e e n s lawn
for us all to enjoy, for the f e w days of sun-
shine w e will get.

ICSM's Cameras
I think y o u m a y find it interesting what
the staff/student c o m m i t t e e have to say
o n t h e matter. The minutes from their last
m e e t i n g (22 M a r c h 1999) are attached, I
k n o w they are o l d minutes but it does
clarify t h e situation o n t h e cameras!!
See p a g e 5, paragraph c for the rel-
evant section.
Cheers!

And here Is page 5, paragraph c...
c) Behaviour during lectures
It w a s r e p o r t e d that c o m p l a i n t s have
b e e n received f r o m lecturers regarding
the b e h a v i o u r o f students d u r i n g lec-
tures... It w a s reported that t h e noise
levels a n d t h e interruptions o f people
w a l k i n g in a n d out o f t h e lecture theatre
m a d e it difficult to both teach a n d con-
centrate. It w a s generally a g r e e d that
this sort o f behaviour w o u l d not be tol-
erated particularly in t h e p r e s e n c e o f
patients...
Action
At t h e b e g i n n i n g o f s u m m e r term TF will
r e m i n d t h e year o f t h e appropriate stan-
dards o f behaviour. Technicians will be
a l l o w e d to record a n d "show-up" o n the
screens any unacceptable behaviour.
Deadline for letters for
