The S t u d e n t s ' N e w s p a p e r at Imperial C o l l e g e
Ball Ticket Deadline Extended
date will not be changed, as Alexandra
Palace require the final number
attending the event soon after Tues-
day. Alexandra Palace's original dead-
line was 8 June, but they agreed to put
this back by a week after consulting
with the summer ball team and ICU.
Nick Griffith c o m m e n t e d that the
Palace had 'been very reasonable with
us".
It seems likely that many students
intending to go to the ball have been
putting off buying a ticket until the last
minute, for financial or work reasons.
Several students c o m m e n t e d to Felix
that they intended to go, but "hadn't
got around to it". Both David Hellard
and Nick Griffith urged these students
to go along to the Union Office and
buy a ticket as soon as possible, rather
than waiting until the last minute next
week. David Hellard s u m m e d up his
view of many students' attitude; "as
soon as the deadline hits people,
they'll start moving".
The deadline for buying summer ball
tickets, which was originally today, has
been postponed by one week. Large
groups, however, s h o u l d purchase
their tickets as soon as possible as
big bookings may be refused as the
final deadline draws near. The dead-
line has been p o s t p o n e d in an
attempt to generate more ticket sales,
prompting rumours of a slow pick up
in sales as exams draw to a close.
According to Union sources
around six hundred tickets had been
sold by last Wednesday, significantly
lower than the two thousand n e e d e d
in order for the event to break even.
According to Nick Griffith, Chair of the
Summer Ball committee, a further
three hundred tickets have been
reserved; "lots of people booked who
haven't paid" he explained. W h e n
asked if he thought that one thou-
sand tickets would be sold in the final
week, he simply replied "I don't know".
David Hellard, ICU President, was

more up-beat, confidently predicting
"we will certainly reach the numbers
we had last year... I wouldn't be sur-
prised if we reached 1500".
The absolute final deadline for
buying tickets is Tuesday 15 June. This

Biochem Theft Prevented
A thief was caught in Biochemistry
last Wednesday evening, thanks to
the quick thinking of a post doc and
security. The incident e n d e d in a
chase around the Biochemistry build-
ing, culminating in a short fight before
and handed over to the
police.
The man probably
entered the building
before 6pm, and thus
before the main doors
were locked. He was
seen acting suspiciously
by a post-doc research
assistant shortly after 6pm
on the fourth floor of the
building, from where It
was later revealed he
stole a woman's purse.
The member of staff then
contacted security using

Imperial's emergency number (x4444).
Security r e s p o n d e d quickly, con-
fronting the man in the Biochemistry
building, which resulted in a chase
and fight involving around six security
guards. The man's behaviour was very
aggressive, and he lashed out and
punched the guards as they tried to
restrain him.
I tie police were then
coniur ied and arrived
around 6.30pm. They
searched Ihe man and
