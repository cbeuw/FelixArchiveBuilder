M A S C O T R Y took an unusual
twist last Tuesday afternoon
when the C o ' l e g e reverberated
to the sound o f two jubi'ant
C C U factions celebrating, in
traditional s t y l e , the capture
of the other's mascot. T h e
two C C U ' s involved were the
Royal C o l l e g e o f S c i e n c e and
C i t y and G u i l d s .
In a b i d to rejuvinate their
union meetings, the presidents
of R C S U and C & G U h a d given
the go-ahead for ' a mascot
swop- T h e idea o f exchanging
mascots w a s that o f Dave
Dodge, the Theta Bearer.
He, together with Steve
Brightman (President R C S U ) ,
Steve H o y l e (President C & G U )
and R i c h a r d Gunnersby (Spanner
Bearer) signed a truce enabling
the exchange to take p l a c e .
Martin K e s s l e r , e x - V P R C S U ,
Steve Booth, T h e t a Bearer,
K e i t h A h l e r s , e x - P r e s i d e n t
C & G U and the above mentioned
four were the only people who
knew o f the swap prior to both
meetings.
The m a s c o t s , which were
originally to be exchanged
outside C o l l e g e at 12.45pm,
were eventually swopped at
1.01pm. It w a s a c l o s e thing
whether the swop took p l a c e
because Mr Dodge found
difficulty in assembling the
four sections of T h e t a and
had to c a l l in Mr K e s s l e r to
him.
The mascots were later
re-swopped outside C o l l e g e
after both meetings had ended.
Initial reaction to the
exchange w a s unsympathetic;
many loyal supporters, on
both s i d e s , were upset at
this betrayal of faith b y their
Union presidents. Nevertheless,
both meetings d i d get off to a
good start and by the e n d of
the day many of those upset
at being duped had begun to
see the funny side o f the
epi sode.

L a s t Wednesday evening,
a young man was found i n the
Chemistry B u i l d i n g apparently
trying to set fire to it. T h e
youth, aged about 16, had
spread an organic solvent
over the wooden floor of the
Harwood Laboratory. H e w a s
discovered i n the doorway
of the laboratory by D r F l e e t .
T h i s discovery w a s made at
about 9.30pm. It w a s a timely
discovery because had the
fire taken hold it would have
spread to many gallons of highly
inflamable materials and
indeed the building would have
burnt like matchwood.
The youth w a s discovered
crouched over the b l a z i n g
remains of a laboratory coat.
He immediately extinguished
the flames and walked out
of the laboratory and into the
corridor accompained by D r
F l e e t . T h e latter w a s attempting
to question the offender when
he bolted down the corridor
and escap ed v i a a set of
stairs.
The Security Officer h a s
put out notices giving the
following detailed d i s c r i p t i o n
of the youth. He i s about 5 feet
8 inches t a l l , o f medium b u i l d ,
short brownish hair, dark e y e s ,
and h a s - a thin face with a
sharp nose.
At the time, he w a s wearing
a light blue track suit decorated
with numerous bad.ges one
of which bore the inscription
K a m a s a k i . H e w a s a l s o
wearing what w a s thought to
be a hearing a i d but c o u l d
have been a transistor radio
ear p i e c e .
T h i s followed a l e s s
serious incident i n the H u x l e y
B u i l d i n g w h i c h took p l a c e the
preceding' Monday night.
Remains of a burnt display
paper were discovered at about
11.20pm b y one of the security
guards. N o serious damage
resulted.
The Security officer w o u l d
be most interested i n any
information i n connection
with either o f these i n c i d e n t s .
The police have been
informed a n d there i s no
circumstantial evidence to
link the two.
