A T T H E I R T H I R D attempt
the C r o s s Country C l u b
finally found, on the same
day, both a race and some
people to run for them. T h i s
was for the third London
C o l l e g e s League race held
on B r u n e i ' s course at R u i s l i p .
B e i n g represented by only
fifteen people in a l l , I C ' s
third team was incomplete with
only 3 runners; stars that
they are. Namely C o l i n D a l e ,
Andy Davey and Mike Welford
at 88,78 and 76 r e s p e c t i v e l y ,
out of 9 7 . T h e club is desperately
in need of more runners to f i l l
these v a c a n c i e s and so s a l v a g e
the 3rd team who, despite
valiant efforts, are last in the
first d i v i s i o n . The second
team, however, strengthened
its position at about 7'th with
Roman Halenko leading them in
at 30'th, having found his
fell-running s t y l e well suited
to the hilly terrain. Tony
Weir found h i s strength (or was
it speed?) could not compare
with Roman's over this short
(long?) distance and he
f i n i s h e d 3 2 ' n d . At 35'th, 48'th
and 56'th were Dave J o n e s ,
R i c h Harrington and Ian
Isherwood completing the
scoring with A l a n L e a k e y a s
spacer.
The first team utterly
failed to repeat its last
performance of finishing 5 in
the first 15: instead it had
to wait until 19'th place to
complete s c o r i n g . R o b A l l i n s o n
once again led the team in,
though not feeling too pleased
with h i s position of 3 ' r d . Steve
Webb slotted himself into
6'th p l a c e and i n s i s t e d on
telling everyone that he'd had
an e a s y run. Dave Rosen and
Paul C l a r k e finished w e l l up
in 12'th and 16'th p l a c e s but
f a i l e d to say anything worth
reporting. A If Garnett w a s
spacer for the first team at
24'th and the culprit at 19'th
w a s Ian E l l i s , for whom
Special Mention is reserved
(as a l w a y s ) . On a pre-race
warm-up/coucse-see he w a s
tripped by an unrecognised
constraint and had h i s b a s i s
reduced painfully to that of
sprawling on the ground: this
may have affected the feasibility
of a better performance. In
c a s e you don't believe this,
he has produced an alternative
e x c u s e (besides lack of
training), c l a i m i n g that he
received the pointed elbow of
lanky R o b A l l i n s o n in h i s
ribs on the crowded ten-foot-
wide path which was used for
the start of this race. Despite
this drop in performance it
looks as if the first team w i l l
retain first place in D i v 1 by
an increased margin of several
hundred points.
The following Saturday,
three of the club travelled to
Brighton for the South of
Thames Champs d i s q u i s e d as
runners for the H e r c u l e s -
Wimbledon, Walton and South
London teams. Steve (this
is a real race) Webb was 102'nd,
followed by Ian (anything for a
pub-crawl) E l l i s at 132'nd
and Dave (no comment) J o n e s
at 174'th out of 220. T h e real
purpose of this trip was a
v i s i t to a nearby Y o u n g ' s Pub
and this was finally reached
by a circuitous route following
an incorrect d e c i s i o n by the
Navigating Committee. Mean-
w h i l e , Dave Rosen was running
in the North of Thames Champs
and the rest of the club were
making good use of the training
f a c i l i t i e s provided around
Wimbledon Common.

Defence sees IC through
Kings College 1st XI 0 Imperial College 1st XI 1
I C ' s F I R S T S began this
term's league fixtures with
this fine away win over K i n g s .
P l a y i n g against a strong
wind in the first half IC were
pinned back in defence. How-
ever, the team" fought hard and
covered well restricting K i n g s
to few goalscoring c h a n c e s .
Even when K i n g s did get
through they found goalkeeper
Kev A l l e n in good form.Towards
the end of the half, IC counter-
attacked well with Terry
Lindon making some blinding
runs down the right w i n g . IC
were therefore relieved to hear
the half-time w h i s t l e with the
score sti II at 0—0.
The second half w a s a far
more evenly contested affair
with IC failing to make real
use of the wind advantage.
Nevertheless they c l i n c h e d
the game with the only goal of
the game following a quick
counter attack. A K i n g ' s
forward shot against the
post, the ball was c l e a r e d ,
Terry Grimwade moved it on
to Steve Gee who broke clear
and lobbed the ball over the
advancing keeper's head and
into the net. Soon afterwards
an excellent save by the
K i n g ' s goalkeeper prevented
IC from going further ahead.
However, due to a splendid
team effort, IC held on to
w i n . Steve Bates deserves
special mention for an
outstanding display in the
heart of the defence, and for
h i s incesant chanting of
" E i V e e v o " which has been
an inspiration to the team
throughout the s e a s o n .
Team:- K Allen, C Howell,

Indifference doesn't pay
Indian Gym 3 Imperial College ' A ' XI 2
C S T A R T E D this match
rather i nd i f ferent ly. Consequent ly
Indian Gym got on top from the
start, taking most of the ball
n midfield and creating
many c h a n c e s . In a ten minute
spell mid-way through the
first half they scored three
g o a l s , two of which were
obviously i l l e g a l . However
this is the penalty a team
pays if for various reasons
they can provide no umpire.
However at this point IC
woke up and began putting
pressure on the Indian Gym
goal, resulting in some good
saves from their keeper.
With Harry Magnay providing
the forwards with some e x c e l l e n t
p a s s e s , the pressure paid off
when Bob Middleton scored
from c l o s e in at the end of
the half.
After the break, IC kept
up the pressure and were
unlucky not to score almost

team (or most of them) and
five opposition (reputed to
belong to U C ) . Obviously with
a 2—1. majority of players IC
could not but thrash their
opponents. So U C frightened
by this prospect, conceded
the match (to give us two
points in the league), borrowed
some of our players and played
in a friendly' manner. However,
after demoralising us by
scoring umpteen goals in the
first 5 minutes they sprang
their next trick by producing
s i x more players (who had
found some difficulty in
locating the ground). So
they took back the two points
and we began a g a i n . T h i s
straight away when a certain
left winger m i s s e d again
(not quite a s bad a s C h a r i n g
C r o s s , but C l o s e ) . H o w e v e r
good play by I C ' s 'adopted'
right winger and Mike Isles led
to M i k e s c o r i n g I C ' s second
g o a l . At this point the game
opened up and the play moved
q u i c k l y from end to end, both
teams coming c l o s e to scoring
the vital g o a l . However
neither s i d e added further to
the score sheet. T h e game
ended on a high note with
J a s p e r pursuing their inside
right with murderous intent
after he had chopped down from
behind. T h i s w a s a good

time not s o friendly, although
they s t i l l de-moralised us
by s c o r i n g umpteen g o a l s in
the first five minutes! However
at half time we played a trick
on them by m a g i c a l l y changing
our goal keeper into a goal
scoring forward. T h i s time it
w a s our turn to be the dominating
s i d e , and it nearly worked. By
the end of the match we had
3 goals to our credit w h i c h

Short corner play lacking
Chalfout St Peter 5
D E F E N C E S had a hard time
on this bumpy pitch where a
hard hit pass could bounce
alarmingly. So, as the score
reflects, the attacks had
most of it their own way.
Chalfout, on their home ground,
and obviously used to the
conditions, found their rhythm
quicker than IC, and went
into the lead. Bob Middleton
levelled the scores with a well
taken reverse-stick flick.
The play moved from end to
end, mainly due to inability
to cut out p a s s e s . IC took the
lead from a penalty ' f l i c k ' by
Kim Houlden, but Chalfout
q u i c k l y came back, and .went
5—2 up. IC recovered from the
Imperial College 1st XI 3
shock, and although they had
the best of the game from then
on, only one goal came — B o b
Middleton scoring again after
good play by S i g G o l d i n g .
A s throughout the season,
the main IC failing was poor
play at short corners. If
this is improved, there is no
reason why disappointing
results shouldn't be left
behind, e s p e c i a l l y considering
the good performances by
A l a n Brown, B o b Middleton,
and S i g G o l d i n g .
