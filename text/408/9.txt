ITS P R O B A B L Y a mistake trying to
evaluate an artist's s u c c e s s potential
on the evidence of a debut performance
as was the c a s e with E l k i e Brooks and
her new band. However, I came away
from Saturday night's concert in the Great
H a l l feeling that the E l k may well be
making the same mistakes that have
caused widespread a c c l a i m to so far
elude her counterpart in the feminist
rock stakes — Maggie B e l l . The main
fault with both ladies is in their choice
of material. Whereas Ms B e l l simply
seems unable to pick the songs that do
justice to her undoubted talent, Ms
Brooks c h o o s e s , these d a y s , to concentrate
to some degree on her own songwriting
ability. No way is she a G-stringed
L o w e l l George.
Having been generally disappointed
with the low standard of songs on her
new album I'd expected that live, they
might have been given a new dimension,
as was the c a s e with her old band
Vinegar Joe — they being a fine live act
but a l w a y s unable to cut it on record.
I was wrong. The show took one hell
of a time to get off the ground, the lady
getting little help from a surprisingly
insipid band.
On paper, the eight-piece combination
boasted a fine musical pedigree. Included
were two Vinegar Joe stalwarts, Steve
York on bass, and the E l k ' s old man Pete
Gage on guitar, plus the rated Isaac
Gilloury. A l s o featured was a black
male v o c a l trio, who were largely
disposable, they adding little depth to
the lady's overall sound — indeed their
supposed harmonic v o c a l i s i n g sounded
particularly sharp on o c c a s s i o n . A l l
this gave the gig a definite flatness
that didn't pick up until the final quarter,
the band up until then earning a deservedly
lame response from the s i z a b l e crowd. ; ;
A s mentioned previously, most of
the material played was that which
f i l l s the grooves of her s o l o album,
exceptions being Smokey R o b i n s o n ' s
'Shop Around', the Bobby Womack tune
'Point of no Return' and what proved to
be her encore the old F a c e s hit 'Stay
with Me'.
Anyway, the band have plenty of time
to improve and justify the money A M
is ploughing into them in a hope that
they w i l l reap the rewards of s u c c e s s
in a couple of y e a r s . I w i s h them luck
— they'll need it.
The support band were c a l l e d C h a r l i e .
They were loud.
