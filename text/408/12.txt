"Israel can never become
a secular state
T H A T WAS the statement made
by Mr H u c k f i e l d , M P for
Nuneaton and Chairman of the
" L a b o u r friends of I s r a e l " ,
when speaking at I C l a s t
T u e s d a y . Mr H u c k l e f i e l d w a s a
late replacement for Mr E r i c
Moonman who w a s originally
invited by the J e w i s h Society
to speak o n the topic " A sane
p o l i c y i n the M i d d l e E a s t " .
Mr H u c k f i e l d although not
h i m s e l f J e w i s h , declared h i s
staunch support for Israel as
the only democratic s o c i a l i s t
country i n the Middle E a s t .
He d i d not s e e Israel as
a bulwark against Communism,
or the Soviet U n i o n ; but rather
as a p l a c e where " d e m o c r a c y
w o r k s " a n d , " d e m o c r a c y looks
as i f it h a s every intention of
surviving.
Mr H u c k f i e l d e x p r e s s e d
concern at what he s a w a s the
drift of p u b l i c opinion away
from I s r a e l . H e suggested tha*
there should be a new initiative
from Israel to solve the
refugee problem. T h e Israeli
Government should negotiate
with any representative of
the P a l e s t i n i a n s , " w h o have
as much right to exist a s a
people as the I s r a e l i s , " T h i s
initiative, which might include
the setting-up of a West-Bank
State, would form world public
opinion on the A r a b response.
Rejecting the idea of a
secular, non-religous State
of Israel, he s a i d that it
would produce a similar
situation to the L e b a n o n . If
the P a l e s t i n i a n problem w a s
solved, he s a w a " s i m m e r i n g
d o w n " , in the Middle E a s t ,
and eventually, an Israel with
secure frontiers, peacefully
co-exisint with neighbouring
Arab States.

RCS say no to
disaffiliation
T H E R C S Union meeting on
decided, by a majority of
over 2 to 1 with a large number
of abstentions, that I C U
should remain affiliated to the
National Union of Students
(NUS). T h e d e c i s i o n , embodied
in a motion proposed by Mr
Brightman, P r e s i d e n t R C S U ,
came after the i s s u e h a d been
d i s c u s s e d by the meeting.
Mr Brightman, spening the
d i s c u s s i o n , s a i d that there
had been growing discontent
over the years with N U S .
"The political aspects of
NUS are not in line with
student thinking", he s a i d .
He t h o u gh t that other
universities might pull out of
NUS if I C were to do s o .
Several other senior officers
of Imperial C o l l e g e Union were
also at the meeting and gave
their v i e w s . Mr R i z Shakir,
I C U D P , urged the meeting
to look at what N U S d i d .
"The Executive (of NUS) only
do things to further their
political careers", he said.
Referring to the cuts in
education spending, Mr
Shakir said that the N U S h a d
made no impact in i t s attempts
to have these cuts reversed.
What the N U S should be doing
is to help the worse off
students such as the overseas
students, instead of dashing
off to sign 17-page communiques
on the state of the world —
something which N U S knew
nothing about.
Ms Mary Attenborough,
Maths Dep R e p , however, d i d
not feel the same w a y . T h e
state of the world w a s important
she s a i d , and claimed that the
other speakers were adopting
a sour grapes attitude. T h e
way to get things done w a s
by putting i n motions to national
conference — I C d i d not do
so for the Scarborough
Conference.
Mr Tony F i t z g e r a l d , P h y s i c s
Dep R e p , said that N U S h a d
done a great deal for students.
"an effort is required to make
it (NUS) more representative.
It is up to the individual
student to put their view-
point in the forum of NUS"r
he said.
He concluded: "We must
work hard and democratically
to make NUS what we want it
to be instead of sitting on
our backsides".
T h i s w a s also the line
adopted earlier in the meeting
by Mr Derrick Everett,
External Affairs Officer.
However, he d i d not think that
the time for a d e c i s i o n h a d
arrived. H e wanted the d e c i s i o n
deferred until the 19th February
When C h a r l e s C l a r k e , P r e s i d e n t
N U S and Ian M i n n i s , P r e s i d e n t
Aston U n i v e r s i t y w i l l be at
I C for a debate on N U S .
Sue is Bo' Belle
T H E C & G Union meeting
started at 1.15pm with the
E x e c rushing in with Theta.
T h i s brought the whole room to
its feet and after a shower of
paper darts the meeting began
its b u s i n e s s . After a plug for
the Engineers Dinner and
Dance there followed the " t r a i l "
of Messrs Doyle and F o s t e r ,
members of the E x e c , both
accused of m i s s i n g the last
bar night. T h e two gentlemen,
bound and gagged, pleaded
guilty and were sentenced to
be dowsed by a fire hose
beside Queen's Tower.
There followed a d i s c u s s i o n
on dissaffiliation from N U S and
John Downs gave a short
speech to outline the factors
involved. T h i s w a s followed
by the B o ' B e l l e e l e c t i o n .
There w a s originally . only
one female candidate, Sue
Winterburn of C C D I, the
other candidate w a s Tom
F i s h e r of Guildsheet fame.
After some on the spot recruiting,
five ladies and one gent stood
for the post. A s expected the
vote was very much for T o m
F i s h e r and Sue Winterburn, the
others receiving very little
support. (John Downs gave
ample support to nearly a l l
those who stood (his hand w a s
up at least four times.)
Jt w a s decided after a
count, . that T o m F i s h e r w a s
elected B o ' B e l l e . T h i s
disappointed the C C D crowd.
However, after offering a
feeble excuse and an urge to
tradition, T o m F i s h e r resigned
and Sue Winterburn became
B o ' B e l l e ;
