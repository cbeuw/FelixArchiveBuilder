Residential-short term
privately owned property
H E R E IS good news for all of
you who cannot afford to pay
£12 a week for a s i n g l e room in
E a l i n g . Westminster C i t y
C o u n c i l has a scheme, s t i l l
in its early s t a g e s , for using
short life privately owned
property, the owners of w h i c h
are w i l l i n g to make it a v a i l a b l e
on agreed terms. T h e C o u n c i l ' s
intention is to accommodate
mainly single people already
living in Westminster. A s
with many authorities, West-
minster has a large number of
privately owned properties
and with the object of putting
some of these properties
back into o c c u p a t i o n , its
council on 29th September
1975 approved a scheme for
their short term use in c a s e s
in which their owners are
w i l l i n g to co-operate.
The main points of the
scheme are as f o l l o w s : -
1. Arrangements between
P r i v a t e Owners and the
C o u n c i l .
a) Length of tenure.
By negotiation w i t h
individual owners but with a
minimum period of s i x months
for both unfurnished and
furnished properties a n d with
a minimum period of notice
of three months on either
s i d e .
b) Rent
F a i r rent less estimated
running expenses for repairs
and management.
c) Repairs
Owners w i l l be asked to
carry out initial repairs as
necessary. Repairs during the
C o u n c i l ' s tenure (other than
those which w i l l be the
tenant's responsibility) w i l l
be carried out by the c o u n c i l .
Such repairs w i l l be done
only in consultation with the
owner who w i l l have the
option if he does not agree,
of terminating his agreement
with the C o u n c i l .
d) Vetting o1 Tenants
Owners w i l l have an
opportunity to vet tenants
selected for their properties
by the C o u n c i l .
e) Vacant possession on
termination
It w i l l be the C o u n c i l ' s
responsibility to ensure t h i s .
2. Arrangements between the
C o u n c i l and tenant
a) Selection of tenants
Priority w i l l be given to
s i n g l e people on the b a s i s of
no l i a b i l i t y by the C o u n c i l
to rehouse at the end of its
tenure of the property.
b) Tenure
Weekly tenancies
c) Rent
F a i r rent, r e b a t e d as
appropriate in individual
c a s e s .
d) Repairs
Tenants responsibility w i l l
be limited to minor repairs
and decorations.
e) Deposits
Tenants w i l l pay a deposit
equivalent to four w e e k ' s
rent returnable on termination
of the tenancy provided a)
the rent account is c l e a r b) there
is no damage to the dwelling
c) the C o u n c i l recovers vacant
possession of the dwelling <
on the agreed date.
Westminster C i t y C o u n c i l
say that students may only
apply individually so there is
no p o s s i b i l i t y of the Union
taking over property on-block.

L E T T E R S
IC crest
Sir, — T h i s C o l l e g e has one
of the m o s t distinguished
coat of arms in B r i t i s h heraldry,
to d i s p l a y the entire " R o y a l
A r m s " indifferenced is some-
thing that not even the P r i n c e
of Wales is permitted to do.
However, the artistic standard
of the portrayals of the arms
seems a l w a y s to have been
bad and the latest version on
the I C s l o p shirts is disgracefully
inaccurate.
, T h e bone of contention is
the line dividing trie royal
bit from the book bit. It is
described in the official
blazon as " p e r fisjf* w h i c h
means a horizontal line
d i v i d i n g the s h e i l d into two
equal areas, not some after
thought tucked in to, f i l l the
point at the bottom; .that fs<
described as " i n base"'.
I have seen only one good
representation of the, arms
(apart from a document from
the C o l l e g e of Arms) and that
is on the stone work above the
entrance to M i n e s .
So, s i n c e we c a n boast
such an eminent coat of arms,
could I please implore those
responsible for letterheads,
blazer b a d g e s etc and
particularly slop s h i r t s , to
get it right in future.
Yours faithfully,
