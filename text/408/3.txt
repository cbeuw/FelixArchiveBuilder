IN T H E LAST issue of F E L I X ,
the Women's Studies Course
diary was published; papers
prepared for discussion
cover a wide variety of topics
of general interest as well as
areas specific interest to the
women in College. Subjects
range from 'Women and the Law'
to their cross cultural roles.
The discussions will take
place at 12.30pm during
Wednesday lunch times in the
ICWA lounge.
Our own society recently
acknowledged women as the
equals to their male counter
parts, as specified by the
Sex Discrimination Act. It is
important, if the Act is to
work successfully, that
everyone, men and women,
understand the law. Leaflets
giving a short guide to the
Sex Discrimination Act will
soon be available from both
the Welfare office and the
ICWA lounge.
For final year students
at least, this is interview
frenzy time of year and it
would be of interest to have
some kind of record of what
of members Intend doing on
leaving College. With this
idea In mind, we propose
sending a questlonalre to
third year women to find out
how ambitious and aspirations
have altered since coming to
College and the types of
careers they now intend
pursuing.
The results could be of
use in stimulating interest in
sixth form girls to read for
science and engineering
degrees, so please complete
and return the questionaires.
On a lighter note, the
Easter Ball is to take place
on Friday, March 5th and will
comprise of a five course
meal with sherry, wine and
port plus after d i n n e r
entertainments until 4.00am.
Tickets can be bought from
myself (Beit 121), Alison
Halstead (Beit 124) and
Isobel Donnelly also in Beit,
for £11.50 a double.
If you are 5'5" tall or
over, and wear size 10 or 12,
you hjave the opportunity of
helping to raise money for
the creche. Lady Flowers is
holding a manequin parade in
early March and requires several
models to sport clothes designed
by students from a London
fashion school. If you fit the
above description and would
like to help finance the creche,
please write to Lady Flowers
or myself stating your height,
size and where you can be
contacted.
Now then, at the risk of
starting the election fever
even sooner than usual, I
would like, to point out that
within six weeks the nomination
papers will be posted for
ICWA offices for the session
76-77. This year we would
like to see all posts fiercely
contested by hoards of dynamic
enthusiastic people.Do consider
It and If you want to know
more about what the jobs
involve, this years officers
will be happy to tell you.
Don't dismiss it - Union work
is at once exciting ' and
rewarding. 1

As a student you are entitled

the travel allowance, any

your weekly requirements.
