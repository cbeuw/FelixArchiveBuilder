More to religion than
ceremony
N E X T W E E K , the Imperial C o l l e g e
C h r i s t i a n Union are holding a s e r i e s of
t a l k s to be given by Dr Peter May as part
of their week of a c t i o n . T h e week of
action, the first for s i x y e a r s , is designed
to awaken peoples interest in C h r i s t i a n i t y .
Members of the U n i o n w i l l be c i r c u -
lating freely within the C o l l e g e and
engaging them in d i s c u s s i o n over the
issue of Christianity.
. Dr Peter May, pictured right, is a
travelling secretary for the University
C o l l e g e s C h r i s t i a n F e l l o w s h i p and is
a d v i s e r to the C h r i s t i a n unions in Reading
Southampton, and Surrey u n i v e r s i t i e s , a a
well as half the c o l l e g e s in U L U — one
Of these being I C .
A n amiable and sincere man, he s a y s
that he first started to think s e r i o u s l y
about C h r i s t i a n i t y when he was 17 years
old. H e had come to question the b a s i s
of the morals w h i c h h i s parents were
keen to pass on to him and found that
parents had no b a s i s for their b e l i e f s .
T h i s left him in a stare of uncertainty.
U p till then he had only received the
usual run of the mill religious education
and having few C h r i s t i a n friends, tended
to d i m i s s C h r i s t i a n i t y on " s e c o n d - h a n d
o p i n i o n " . T h i s , he s a y s , left him
" a g n o s t i c , and when the moon was
s h i n i n g , a t h e i s t i c " .
However, meeting his friends, who
professed a personal belief in Christ
and seeing the good quality of their
life made him realise that " t h e r e was
more to religion than c e r e m o n y " . With an
open mind he set out to look into Christianity
(he was challenged by his friends) and
began to read the New Testament at the
rate of a chapter a night — a task that
took nine months and left him more
confused than before. •
"I had thought that after one read
through of the New Testament I would be
able to come to an intelligent, adult
d e c i s i o n about this business and d i s m i s s
it once and for a l l " , he s a y s . But this
was not the c a s e and it was not until he
had waded through the New Testament
three times that he became convinced
of the truth of Christianity.
It was at this time that he entered
the Royal Free H o s p i t a l , There were
then very few C h r i s t i a n s at the h o s p i t a l ,
but within 18 months of his. arrival the
number had grown to over 50. S i n c e
then he has been an active and practicing
C h r i s t i a n .
He believes that Christianity is more
relevant than ever to modern s o c i e t y ,
e s p e c i a l l y to counteract the " s o c i a l
lack of c o n c e r n " . There is a lot of
confusion b e t w e e n r e l i g i o n and
Dr Peter May
Christianity, he s a y s , and the churches
should go back to the ideas of the New
Testament. The attempt, by the churches
to brainwash people has In h i s thinking,
failed miserably, and is a major departure
from the New Testament.
He hopes to meet as many people at
IC as he can duririg his stay and anyone
who bumps into him w i l l definitely have
their ideas a b o u t C h r i s t i a n s and
C h r i s t i a n i t y jolted.

week can be found on page 2.

Surprise, surprise, S t e l l a Godfrey agrees with quite a few of
our comments on ICWA. We concur with a few of hers too: notably
that women have consistently proved themselves to be man's
equal.
Stella acknowledges that 'ICWA needs a k i c k in the p a n t s ' .
Our article was intended to help precipitate that. B y the way
S t e l l a , thanks for the comments about I C U ; w e ' l l look into it and
report back later.
All—female exec?
S t i l l , we doubt whether women's lib. w i l l have much to
grumble at, what with R C S U likely to have an all-female e x e c ,
next year. Not to mention that F i o n a C a s s i d y ' s standing for
RSMU President!
Ms Godfrey's reply leads us to outline the aims of ' T i t b i t s ' .
The column e x i s t s to stimulate d i s c u s s i o n on relevant IC topics
and to inform s t u d e n t s of what's happening in the higher
'clique^-socs' of their union. We believe the ICWA article
subscribes to this definition. Titbits is written by a number of
students well atuned to IC affairs. T o preserve journalistic
mobility we feel that we must a present remain anonymous.
Congratulations to all involved on the R C S U and C & G U mascot
swop. Certainly a novel idea which brough both union meetings
a l i v e . A s Steve Brightman commented 'It really is a shame that
some people have not taken it with the spirit with w h i c h it w a s
c o n c e i v e d ' . C o u l d this possibly be the start of an IC WHO, with
co-operation between the C C U s ?
Mascot swop
Somebody who didn't share S t e v e ' s enthusiasm for the swop
was his V P , C h a l k i e 'I want to be ICU Hon S e c ' White, w h o ' s
'in charge' of R C S U mascotry, but wasn't told of the swop until
after the meeting. C & G U exec can't exactly be s a i d to be united
over the i s s u e either; fireworks should be f l y i n g from that
corner soon. At present both unions look like talking the matter
to Extraordinary General Meetings in the hope that ordinary
union members can v o i c e their views on their president's actions.
Titbits hopes that this w i l l see an end to the matter.
In the meanwhile don't forget your ticket for G u i l d s Dinner
and Dance next F r i d a y . A s usual it looks like being a hive of
election activity with all p o s s i b l e ICU candidates making an
effort to impress.
COPY DATE
A l l contributions for the next i s s u e of F E L I X must reach
the F E L I X office by 2.00pm on Mon. 26th J a n . Contributions
not making this deadline w i l l be zapped to smithereens!
