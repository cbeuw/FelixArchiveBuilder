Restorative
tonic for IC
L e e ' B ' 3
Imperial College 17
A F T E R T H E previous w e e k ' s
defeat IC L a c r o s s e C l u b needed
a restorative tonic. T h i s
match proved to be just what
the doctor ordered.
Once again IC trooped off
to darkest Orpington, a couple
of players short, but in good
spirits as they had beaten
L e e about two months before,
again with a deficit of players.
Imagine I C ' s delight when,
on taking to the field of play,
L e e proved to have one player
l e s s .
The match itself was really
quite enjoyable, as IC for
once did not have an uphill
battle. Most of the play was in
L e e ' s half, which proved a
mite boring for I C ' s defence,
and led to them making many
runs into the attack. It was
good to s e e the forwards
building up their a t t a c k s rather
than running straight at g o a l .
Derek Senner and Martin
Smeaton set up some very
good moves and, if not for
good goalkeeping, would have
scored more often than they,
d i d . D e n n i s Kehoe, who was
playing h i s first match, did
extremely w e l l , drawing his
defence man out from in front
of goal, and once getting on
the score sheet. Richard
Forster, while playing only
h i s second game, showed
that he could develop into a
very useful and powerful
player, scoring four times.
C r o s b y ' s equivalent of the
thing from the pit did his
usual stuff and scored and
scored, greedy bustard. Paul
Jepson and B i l l J a c k s o n in
defence, did allot of running
about and quickly terminated
most of L e e ' s a t t a c k s . Mean-
-while the goalkeeper and
captain, whose name I forget,
let in three g o a l s .
We ought to have matches
like this more often.

L A S T W E E K the 1st team
completed the first half of their
league programme with an
away game at B S C and a home
game against the Z o o .
L a s t term we had gone to
B S C and beaten them 5 - 4
in the cup in a very tough
game. T h i s time however, they
had a much better third player
in their team, and were out for
revenge. KaWei was in very
good form and won all his
three games, but C o l i n a n d . I
couldn't keep up the standard,
and after eight sets the score
was four a l l . In the final set
their number one player beat
C o l i n in three games to
c l i n c h the match.
The match against the Zoo
was very- different. On our
home ground and smarting from
defeat the previous evening we
swept to a 7—0 lead before
the Z o o managed to win an
enthralling eighth set which
contained 5 n a n c e s .
The win against the Z o o
left us in second place in
the league at the half way
stage having lost 2 games;
one to top. place Harrow Road
police (unbeaten as yet) and
the other to fourth place B S c .
Congratulations to William
Ho who leads the d i v i s i o n a l
averages with 1QO% record. T h e
seconds s t i l l have one game
to play to reach the halfway
point in their league. If they
win this match they w i l l move
into third place which is a
very good achievement consider-
ing they lost their first three
league matches.
Congratulations a l s o to
Y e e Min Y i u who beat Vladimir
Pozdniakov in the final of
the open knockout at the end
of l a s t term. L e t s s e e if he
can reach the final of this
terms handicap knockout,
(although I doubt it with me
deciding the handicap he
receives!).

Imperial College A ' s 4
Osterley V 31
T h i s mornings match yet
again showed that, in most
c a s e s , youthful verve, growing
experience and confidence, and
and hangovers are no match for
the age and wisdom of a c l u b
side.
With no players lost to upper
teams, the side . was strong
although lacking some regular
players.
In the first twenty minutes
we caused our own trouble,
play'ng well but not together
leaving our own ' half. When
eventually our line was
crossed 't was due to, as in the
f o l l o w i n g , 'our tires, missed
tackling, 'h moves leading up to
the score. Our problem was
greatest in not being able to
provide the backs with good
ball from the set scrum even
though Tony F i t z g e r a l d was
hooking. The Osterley grey
haired f
ront row split ours
apart leaving nothing for
us to push against. B y , the
end of the first half we had
started to match Osterley but
no more.
However, the second h a l f ,
saw a complete turnabout
with the A ' s putting a lot of
pressure on, as the front
eight worked more as a unit.
T h i s work rate eventually
brought its rewards and a
good handling move, from
a loose maul, by forwards and
backs, squeezed B o b L e e s o n
into the c o m e r . After that the
pressure dropped allowing
Osterley to Improve on their
lead. E v e n though we matched
them, they were handed points
by being allowed to run and
throw the ball around.
The result was disappointing
as the team worked hard and
earnestly, but hopefully we
have benefitted from this
match.
Thanks must go to Ian
M c L e a n for h i s excellent
refereeing and to a l l players
for turning up on time.

Orienteering
Records smashed
SMASHING A L L previous
records, the Orienteering C l u b
descended upon Great Wood,
Potters Bar in undreamt of
numbers — fifteen! With such
numbers surely s u c c e s s must
follow? Nearly, but not quite,
as our intrepid Captain Dave
Rosen was pushed into second
place on the ' A ' course by
A l i s t a i r Doyle (Captain,
University of London C l u b ) .
The rest of us had Some
very good e x c u s e s . . . . O n the
' A ' course A l a n L e a k e y ,
"I had an arguement with a
rabbit h o l e " , was 27th in
78 minutes, 20 minutes behind
the winner. The ever improving
Rob A l l i n s o n finished in 87
minutes. Unfortunately he
missed a control and s o was
beaten by Pete Johnson (42nd)
Ian Isherwood (51st) and Steve,
"I got l o s t " , Webb (57th). Better
luck next time Rob!
What about the other c o u r s e s ,
you may w e l l a s k ? Well on the
' B ' course Imperial did not
bother to enter anyone, so we
did not do very w e l l there!
The main entry w a s on the
6km long ' C course which
although shorter, w a s s t i l l
technically quite difficult.
Encouraging results here
from Michael B l o o m , placed
37th and James S i n c l a i r ,
48th; whilst, on her first
attempt at Orienteering,
Beverley Davis did w e l l to
complete the ' E ' course.
Next Sunday, the c l u b hits
Gallowstree Common near
Reading where a 'National
Badge Event' is being held.
We w i l l be taking a minibus
and hope to do even better
than last Sunday.
