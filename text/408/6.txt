ICWA President
replies
Sir, — May I be permitted to
comment on some of the points
made in the article ' T i b i t s '
in F E L I X , No 407. F i r s t l y ,
F E L I X has not witnessed
scenes of hysterical rejoicing
from the ICWA front s i n c e the
introduction of the E q u a l
Rights A c t for one simple
reason. Women have not only
known themselves to be
equal to their male counterparts
for some considerable time,
they have c o n s i s t e n t l y proved
themselves to be s o . T h e
fact that the law has only
just come to realise this is
more an embarrassment to it
than a cause for congratulations.
True, it is a long awaited
milestone in the campaign
for equal rights for women,
but, whereas laws can be
changed with relative e a s e ,
it takes a far more c o n s c i o u s
effort to erase the centuries'
long conditioning which s t i l l
pervades much of our s o c i e t y .
Secondly, where, we ask
o u r s e l v e s are " t h e hoards of
young men valiantly knocking
on I C W A ' s d o o r " . Men, far from
being excluded from the
a c t i v i t i e s that ICWA o r g a n i s e s ,
have a l w a y s been keenly
welcomed.
The article' then goes on to
tritely sum up ICWA as if it
were on E n t s sub-committee,
a " s o c i a l off shoot of I C U " .
Perhaps a complete list of
ICWA a c t i v i t i e s would help
show that this is not the
c a s e . In addition to those
stated in the article, ICWA
has organised a F l a t - s h a r e
scheme operated prior to the
autumn term and for which
ICWA w a s formally thanked by
;
I C U C o u n c i l ; debates have
been h e l d ; a weekly d i s c u s s i o n
group is run; informative
talks have been given by guest
speakers and a P G and O v e r s e a s
Students evening has been
organised. F o r this term more
t a l k s have been arranged as
has a. very comprehensive
women's studies course.
A s to the IC E x e c u t i v e or
the Carnival Committee(?)
organising these events, I
would imagine that they would
reply that they had quite
enough to do already. T h i s
was the reason for setting
up the ICWA committee in the
first place and this is true of
all Union committees.
Some ICWA members have
a l s o v i s i t e d their old s c h o o l s
to g i v e talks to sixth form
girls in the hope of encouraging
them to study here. *
ICWA, ' a perpetual monument
to the IC sex ratio' — I counter
by a s k i n g 'Is any other group
within the Union doing more
to relieve the problem?/
That some of our members
do not wish to belong to ICWA
is no maxim for disbanding
ICWA; if this were so we
would have to start questioning
the continued existence of
not only the C C U s . as well as
ICWA. but indeed ICU itself.
That 'you can't please a l l the
people all the time' was
realised by a far more able
President than I. Whilst I
share this sentiment, I do
not wish to be shot for it!
One point I would like to
make clear is that whilst every
member of the Women in A c t i o n
Group is a member of J C W A , the
reverse is not true^ and in
airing their views they are not
speaking for the whole of ICWA.
F i n a l l y , it is one thing to
say to a Presidential candidate
that 'ICWA needs a kick in the
pants', it is another thing as
President to do it. I would
agree that it is entirely needed
and go on to include not just
ICWA, but the whole of I C U .
The appalling turnout at
Union General Meetings bears
w i t n e s s to this. T o conclude,
suggestions and new ideas for
improving ICWA are always
welcomed, please take advantage
of this.
Yours s i n c e r e l y ,
S T E L L A G O D F R E Y ,
ICWA President.
Sir, — May I remind the authors
of " T i t b i t s " ( F E L I X N o . 407)
that oh November 20th, 1975
all male students at IC were
given the opportunity of joining
the ICWA Committee as
" M r I C W A " (a perfectly
serious post, despite its
title).
There were just three
candidates, one of whom w a s
a u l y e l e c t e d . Therefore, by
my c a l c u l a t i o n s , (admittedly
only those of a mathematician),
trie " h o a r d s of young men
valiantly knocking on I C W A ' s
d o p r " c o n s i s t of precisely
two* persons.
Having made this trivial
point, I would like to say how
stimulating I found the rest of
the article and I look forward
to hearing other reactions to it.
Yours faithfully

NUS - do you care?
Sir, — It is strange that the
last national conference of
NUS could- be attacked in
F E L I X for not being directly
relevant to students on one
page and then having quite
a good report of all the many
issues d i s c u s s e d in the
centre pages.
U s i n g the "not relevant to
students" argument the
d i s c u s s i o n is now turning to
whether or not we need an
N U S . The issue of needing
travel, welfare, entertainments
and other social ' a c i l i t i e s on
a national level has already
been adequately dealt with by
others. The main need, however
is for an organisation to
represent our needs and
views at a national l e v e l .
If there is nothing that you
want to change, if you don't
want higher grants, if you
don't mind educational cutbacks,
if you don't care about the
economic situation in Britain
and if you don't care what
happens in any other part of
the world then you may as
well leave N U S . If you want
to change anything at a l l ,
though, you must see the need
for a student organisation. It
would be impossible to even
decide on the grants c l a i m ,
let alone run a campaign in
support of it without some
sort of national coordination.
In fact we would be opting
out in the worst possible way
if we admit that on one hand
students need a national
organisation and on the other
to say we are not prepared to
make our contribution towards
it.
It has been claimed by
members of IC Union that a
lack of democracy (which has
lead to a Broad Left " c l i q u e " )
has invalidated the present
national union. And yet what
p o l i c i e s are these self styled
reformers and protectors of
democracy putting forward?
Their main argument seems to
be - " m o s t students are
apathetic" (ie a lot of IC
students are apathetic) which
proves that if a national
union e x i s t s it ought to be
apathetic too. If it is no
student p o l i c i e s you want then
I would say leave N U S — but
I don't believe anyone would
want complete student apathy.
If you do want student ideas
put forward you must protect
N U S as an active union. The
principle of electing a national
executive at a national
conference is central to
active democracy — we must
have an executive that is
responsible to a body that
can mandate it and ensure
that it follows the policy
decided. If it is the p o l i c i e s of
NUS you disagree with, it is
both the p o l i c i e s and.leadership
that you must change through
putting forward alternative
p o l i c i e s at a n a t i o n a l
conference. Of course you
could take the sour grapes
attitude of Derrick Everett —
N U S won't follow our p o l i c i e s
so we w i l l leave it. But I
say if you agree to the need
for a national union you must
stick with it even when it
doesn't pass everything you in
particular agree with and hope
to change it at some other
conference.
F i n a l iy, on international
p o l i c i e s . P e o p l e say — why
worry about C h i l e , A n g o l a ,
or anywhere e l s e , they do
not directly affect u s . It is
in the nature of students
existence however that they
think about i s s u e s , because
that is what education is a l l
about (though on considering
IC students I become less
convinced of this!) Y o u cannot
stop people from wanting to
consider and express views
about any issue they feel to
be important.
If you do not care about the
rest of the world then perhaps
it is about time you d i d . What
happened in C h i l e could happen
here, apartheid in South A f r i c a
has its foundation in racist
ideas that we have here int
Britain. But e v e n , if it could
never happen to you the fact
that fellow members"of humanity
are suffering in many parts of
the world needs every person
to speak out , because
whatever you do not condemn
you are in some way condoning.
