Rape and
the Law
'WHY does a man feel a
need to rape a woman? and
'How do we improve the
current rape situation beyond
new l e g i s l a t i o n ? ' T h e s e were
two outstanding questions
at the end of the ICWA debate
on 'Rape and the L a w ' , last
Tuesday.
One solution to the second
question favoured by the
National C o u n c i l for C i v i l
L i b e r t i e s ( N C C L ) , is the
establishment of Rape C r i s i s
Centres throughout B r i t a i n .
These already exist in the
U S A , providing a 24-hour
phone-in service offering
medical and legal advice to
rape v i c t i m s . They also
provide a more sympathetic
ear to v i c t i m s than the p o l i c e
do, claimed Jean C o u s i n s
from N C C L . One such centre
was set up in London a
month ago.
Another solution came from
J a c k Gratus, author of a
recent article on rape in the
magazine 'Over 21' and a book
' T h e V i c t i m ' . He suggested
that society needed re-educating
on its attitudes to women and
rape. Growing numbers of
w o m e n involved in the
administration of law (women
s o l i c i t o r s , women judges etc)
would help to change the
situation.
Both speakers outlined
the current legal situation
on rape and agreed on the
current problems. They agreed
to differ in the c a u s e s of
the problems and how to
tackle them. Whilst both
appreciated the need to strike
a balance between the rights
of rape v i c t i m s and defendants,
Ms C o u s i n s felt the latter
were w e l l protected after a
recent Law Lords ruling.
T h e ruling, supported by
N C C L , s a y s that a man
cannot be convicted of rape
if he honestly believes his
victim • consented to inter-
course, even when her w i s h e s
were the complete opposite.
The meeting went on
welcome the acceptance of
the Heilbon C o m m i s s i o n ' s
Report on current Rape L a w s .
Its proposals, published in
December, are incorporated
in a private members b i l l ,
sponsored by M P Robin
Corbitt. The bill should get
its s e c o n d reading in
Parliament during February.
Ms C o u s i n s and Mr Gratus
both opposed the current
practice of defence lawyers
trying to blacken rape victims'
characters with questions such
as, 'Are you on the P i l l ? ' ,
'How many lovers have you
had?', 'How many men have
you h a d ? ' , 'How many men
have you slept w i t h ? ' , ect.
They felt that this gave the
impression that the rape
victim was on trial, and not
her a s s a i l a n t . A l l the same
both stressed the difficulties
of juries in rape trials. Often
they had to decide whether
the man or the woman was
telling the truth with little
corroborative evidence.
Ms C o u s i n s a l s o attacked
another common line of defence,
'She did not resist enough'.
If a girl forced to have sex
at knife or pistol - point, she
s a i d , it might not be in her
best interests to resist.
In the ensuing d i s c u s s i o n ,
A A O , R i c k Parker, suggested
that the media falsely defined
the average man's sexual
yardstick as that of a s u c c e s s f u l
playboy. Perhaps rapists
were men lacking sex esteem,
who bemoaned their inability
to live this playboy image.
A lot of d i s c u s s i o n centred
around Mr Gratus's article in
'Over 2 1 ' . In it he asked
women to be c o n s c i o u s of
current society and realise
that in certain circumstances
they might be able to minimize
the chance of getting raped or
assaulted through sensible
action. Several speakers
felt the accent should be
more on s o c i a l and legal
' changes rather than this
to 'stop-gap' approach.

EDITORIAL
The Question of I C ' s d i s a f f i l i a t i o n was d i s c u s s e d at
both the R C S U and C i t y and G u i l d s Union meeting. Both
d i s c u s s i o n s seemed to be characterised by a lack of
knowledge of the situation and in the Guilds meeting they
quite rightly decided not to take a d e c i s i o n on the i s s u e .
However, the R C S meeting did take d e c i s i o n in favour
of remaining within N U S and p a s s e d a motion to that effect.
The question now is not really whether we should
disaffiliate or not but what we w i l l ' d o if we do stay i n .
it is e s s e n t i a l that a situation is not reached whereby
all t h o s c o l l e g e s d i s c u s s i n g the question of d i s a f f i l i a t i o n
decide to remain within N U S and then do nothing to make
N U S more representative of the v i e w s .
And this is the crux of the matter,. Will we, when we
decide not to leave N U S , just sit back and content ourselves
with the fact that the boat has been rocked again? One
sincerely hopes not. F o r it is only by the individual
student participating in N U S , making h i s or her v i e w known
within the forum of the National U n i o n , that any change
can be a c h i e v e d .
Voting to stay in should not mean that we do not want
to lose N U S Travel e t c , but that we want to use our
position inside the N U S to try and make it a body w h i c h
represents not only the small percentage of p o l i t i c a l
(mostly extreme left wing) a c t i v i s t s , but also the majority
of non-activist students in its membership.
It is time we got off our arse and took action instead
of bleeting about the fact that the N U S does not represent
us. No one w i l l listen to you unless you say something and
the time has come for us to stand up and say it. So speak
up and for goodness sake, speak up now and l o u d l y .
Y o u w i l l remember that N U S i s to set up a newspaper,
National Student ( F E L I X N o . 406); Jeremy C l i f t , last
y e a r ' s Sennet editor, i s to help out with it, on a not entirely
voluntary basis. H e left Sennet last November.
T o get back to IC, the election wagon i s on its way
again — soon our ears w i l l be ringing to the chants and
proclamations of candidates for this post and that. T h i s
year, your e y e b a l l s w i l l suffer too, as the amount of
publicity is expected to be greater and better than ever.
F E L I X w i l l be keeping a very c l o s e watch on a l l the
events. So, roll on, roll o n , roll o n . . .
