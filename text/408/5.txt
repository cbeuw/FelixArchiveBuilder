!T H A S B E E N suggested that
aeromodel lers are merely
frustrated p i l o t s . T h i s is not
true at a l l ; aeromodel lers are
just plain c h i c k e n . I have
never understood why any
sane IC student would w i l l i n g l y
risk h i s neck in the Dart
when s i m i l a r s a t i s f a c t i o n is
attainable with two feet
safely planted in deer dung
on Richmond P a r k .
IC Model Aircraft C l u b has
been able to purchase r a d i o -
control equipment for which
we have built a glider. T h e
craze has spread throughout
the c l u b with the resultthat
we now have four machines.
T h i s has brought an unexpected
bonus to the c l u b . We can now
offer a keep-fit s e s s i o n on
Saturday mornings known a s
" m a k e l i k e a towline w i n c h " .
The c l u b i s traditionally
strong on control line combat
f l y i n g . T h i s has largely
given way to radio and indoor
R T P f l y i n g . Future projects
in this field include, I hope, a
spot of outdoor f l y i n g . ( R T P
for the uninitiated means
round — not up — the pole.
Anyone who has ever visited
the Model Engineer E x h i b i t i o n
w i l l remember those things
which flew in c i r c l e s around
ones h e a d .
Our first outing this term
was in fact to the Model
E n g i n e e r e x p o ' . Here the
crowd were treated to the
s p e c t a c l e of several thrilling
crashes when one of our
members ( e m b a r a s s m e n t
forces him, me, to remain
anonymous) attempted to
compete in the R T P competition.
After demolitioning several
models, I temporarily conceded
defeat and flew one of the
exhibition models instead.

I'M S O R R Y about this, but
this i s going to be a serious
article for a change. I hope
this is not going to prevent
those few readers I s t i l l have
from perse vering to the end ol
my contribution. Since some
people seem unable to distinguish
between satire and sincereity
I shall try to be blunt and
e x p l i c i t .
F i r s t l y , I hope you've a l l
read the excellent articles in
F E L I X about the recent N U S
conferences. I wonder, with
the Editor of F E L I X , about
the " r e l e v a n c e of such time-
consuming m o t i o n s " and I
agree that conferences have
become a "forum for political
theorists to express their
grandiose i d e a s " . T h i s is
not because I disagree with
the p o l i t i c s of the N U S
leadership, which I do, but
because I disagree with the
presence of sectarian p o l i t i c s ;
I do not think that students want
to pay one pound per head per
year to s u b s i d i s e an amalgamatio
of debating s o c i e t i e s and to
provide political a c t i v i s t s with
office f a c i l i t i e s , expense
accounts, e t c . If anyone wants
to take p o l i t i c a l action, then
she or he should damn well
pay for it and not expect the
money to come from students
who have no interest in
p o l i t i c s . I am not against
political a c t i v i t i e s in C o l l e g e ,
indeed I would encourage
the d i s c u s s i o n of local or
international issues within
political s o c i e t i e s and even
at Union meetings, so long as
the students wish to d i s c u s s
these i s s u e s . But as far as
the N U S is concerned, I
wish they would devote their
energies to providing advice,
s e r v i c e s and information to
students and to their U n i o n s .
Therefore we should be doing
something about it, even if as
Pete Teague s a y s , we may
have to become, in a sense,
political ourselves.
The question of setting
up a travel service is rather
academic s i n c e the e x i s t i n g
NUS s e r v i c e s are available to
non-members, they need our
trade; e s p e c i a l l y at present!
However, if N U S Travel should
ever go to that great package
tour centre in the sky, we
might have to think about
something, admittedly rather
modest, to take its p l a c e .
There is a s u c c e s s f u l and
independent travel centre at
Bradford and we could perhaps
produce something along
those lines in conjunction
with Brunei University.
My point about the voice
of an independent IC was only
slightly tongue-in-cheek. When
IC was the only University
C o l l e g e N U S it was not
known for the views of Imperial
C o l l e g e Union to be quoted in th<
House of Commons. (No
doubt the_ C o H e g e archivist
can provide the references to
Hansard if anyone is interested).
I'd be interested to hear how
often the opinions of the
NUS are quoted in Parliamentary
debates.
I agreed entirely with Mrs
Gerrard that we should try to
change the p o l i c i e s of the
N U S and a l s o try to make the
most of their s e v i c e s . In
fact I wish we could get our
money's worth out of them. I'm
sure John Downs would have
been grateful for some information
on N U S Headquarters s e r v i c e s
from Mrs Gerrard a little
earlier in the year. A s far
as I can t e l l , John has not
used these services once this
year, but I'm sure he will do
so if n e c e s s a r y . I believe that
John w i l l soon be producing
an article on legal advice and
legal aid in conjunction with
Sue K a l i c i n s k i and the Union
solicitor. T h e most useful
service provided by the N U S
is probably the legal aid fund
referred to by Mr Barrett, which
is a v a i l a b l e to help students
who have been refused legal
aid by the state. T h i s is
only a v a i l a b l e if the N U S
consider that the student has
a good c a s e .
A s Mr Barrett well knows, I
also believe that we should
use all means at our d i s p o s a l
to m a k e the N U S more
representative of its Ordinary
members, and he also knows
that I have been involved in
moves to institute a direct
ballot for the election of
the National E x e c u t i v e . I
hope to pursue this at the
next conference.
Y o u may not be aware that
the N U S E x e c u t i v e have a
policy of encouraging the
central representation of
collegiate U n i v e r s i t i e s such
as that of London. That i s ,
ro discourage individual
colleges from sending
delegates to conference.
The latest step in this policy
was their decision not to
allow the c o l l e g e s of Oxford
and Cambridge to use the new
Conference subsidy fund, which
is designed to a s s i s t the
Unions of small c o l l e g e s
who cannot afford to send
delegates to C o n f e r e n c e s .
I do not think it w i l l be long
before they refuse to accept
a delegation from Imperial
C o l l e g e unless we do something
about it.

Historical Re-enactment
A L L O V E R Britain there are
groups ' of enthusiasts who
regularly muster to re-fight
battles, s i e g e s , campaigns and
s k i r m i s h e s of the E n g l i s h
c i v i l wars. T h i s is done
purely for enjoyment, so a
great deal of relaxation
accompanies mock-battling —
drinking and singing being
amongst the foremost d i v e r s i o n s
engaged in.
T h i s i s by no means an a l l
male a c t i v i t y , although to be
authentic, the role of women
must lie chiefly outside
fighting.
T h e s e musters normally
take p l a c e over a weekend
and occur most frequently
during the summer season
when the weather suits camping.
However, smaller, one-day
events occur throughout the
year. There are three major
independent, national s o c i e t i e s ;
the K i n g s Army and the
Roundhead A s s o c i a t i o n (Army
of Parliament who provide
competition for each other,
and the Sealed Knot Society
L t d . , which fights itself.
P o l i t i c s , in all senses, tend
to be unpopular, the c a u s e
being fairly academic. Everybody
is there to enjoy themselves.
At the larger gatherings
the public is charge entry to
watch the battles. The money
obtained helps to cover the
cost of organising the battle,
any profit going to a charity,
normally specified before the
battle. The K i n g s Army has an
annual parade in Whitehall, to
commemorate the execution of
C h a r l e s I. T h i s year it is
being held on Sunday, 1st
February, starting at about
2.00pm. A l l are welcome to
watch, and if you want to
join in this or any other of
the s o c i e t i e s a c t i v i t i e s ,
please contact S Shaw, Chem.
