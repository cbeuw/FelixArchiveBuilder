Mystery Jets achieved success af-
ter their discovery by DJ/producer
Erol Alkan. They were originally
called ‘Misery Jets’ after Hea-
throw-bound aeroplanes which
regularly flew over their home of
Eel Island, but changed their name
after a spelling mistake. Fact. Ro-
man Hochuli sat down with Mys-
tery Jets’ lead vocalist and key-
board player Blaine Harrison.
How did you first get in contact
with Erol?
We used to all go down to Trash quite a
lot when it was going, which was a club
Erol ran for 10 years. It was really influ-
ential on a lot of people making music
in London at that time. At the start, we
all used to go down there just to see the
bands and see Erol DJ.
We’d done a recording session then
one day I plucked up the courage
to bring him the demo. Turned out
he was a fan and already knew ‘Zoo
Time’, which was our first single. Then
he started playing all our songs right
when they’d come out - as soon as we
recorded something he’d be the first to
play it!
So you hadn’t released very much
and Erol was already spinning
your records?
Erol was one of the first people we met
in the club circuit. He was the first per-
son to ever play our music in a club. At
the time, I wasn’t really aware of the
world of dance music, but as we dived
into the second album, I think we be-
came a lot more aware of remixes and
producers. From that point on, I think
we had more of an opinion of who we
wanted to remix our stuff as well.
Did Erol influence your music at
all?
Yeah, definitely. I mean the first thing
we did with him were some B-sides for
‘Diamonds in the Dark’, which was the
last single off our first album. It just
went really, really well. I remember
we’d all been on tour for about a year
and we were all arguing and screaming
at each other and Erol seemed to be the
only person who could get us to all sit
in the same room together and be nice
to each other. I think that, in a way, is
one of the strongest ways in which he
influenced the second album.
Music Felix chats with Mystery Jets Does It
Offend You,
Yeah? live
A
n Andy Peters haircut
from circa 1990, flying
glowsticks, girls in the
audience who could be
best described as ‘a mess
of neon and basically wearing seven
outfits in one’: you’d think you were
stuck in some bad lycra-sponsored rave
scene nightmare. No, it’s just the front-
man of Does It Offend You, Yeah?’s bad
hair, and the shed load of MySpacers
they’ve bought with them.
Nu-rave image aside, the band crack
into the stomping intro of ‘Weird Sci-
ence’. It’s got the fat bass of Daft Punk’s
Robot Rock and a token Tupac inspired
vocoder entry. It’s got drums and gui-
tars that throb harder than your worst
post-exam hangover.
DIOYY are lyrically tasteless, as the
name of the next track, ‘Battle Royale’,
will suggest. Evidently though, taste-
less is sometimes a good thing, with
the band managing to get the crowd
worked up and jumping as fast as they
can manage. The vocalist, Morgan
Quaintance, jumps onto the stack of
amps on stage with his colourful get-
up which resembles neon-painted py-
jamas and strikes an African clanger.
He shouts “F*** y’all, I’m from Texas”
- the slogan also printed on his shirt.
They bang into ‘Let’s make out’, a
track that couldn’t fail to get the most
miserable person dancing and feeling
the summer festival vibe.
It’s rough. It’s raw. It’s rock clashed
with electro with references to punk.
Influences from the Prodigy, early
Beastie Boys, and Devo are all ap-
parent. DIOYY are a far cry from the
late 1990’s scene of shoe-gazing rock.
They play, shout and dance in full vivid
colour. They’re really a vehicle which
screams at a youthful market and gets
them excited. There’s sound bites that
resemble ‘Take on Me’ by A-Ha but
with Kurt Cobain-esque vocals and
synth leitmotifs, similar to Late of the
Pier or the now defunct Test Icicles.
DIOYY announced their chart mid-
week result is at No. 17. It seems Virgin
weren’t wrong signing these Reading-
based maniacs. They chuck in a live de-
but of ‘Dawn of the Dead’ and finish off
the set with ‘We are Rockstars’, a track
that embodies the band’s message in a
nutshell. Your attention is grabbed, it’s
full of energy and it’s a lot of fun.
Avalon de Paravicini
He used to also give us some records
to listen to. He’d say “You might not
like this but I think you can learn some-
thing from it.” and it really worked. We
started thinking so much more outside
the bubble in terms of production.
You guys also DJ, which of you do
that?
We all DJ, but it’s pretty much me, Wil-
liam and Kai. We usually branch off
into pairs.
We started DJing during the record-
ing of our second album because we
weren’t playing any gigs, since we were
still recording or writing new material,
and we wanted to keep going out and
keep contact with our fans. Spinning
records in clubs just seemed the most
obvious way of doing that.
I keep hearing bands bring up min-
imal techno and I think I remem-
ber hearing you guys mention it in
an interview. Are you guys techno
fans?
I think I know which one you’re talk-
ing about, but we said it as a joke. I
mean I do like dance music but I’m not
into anyone specific and then there’s a
lot of dance music I hate. I really hate
drum’n’bass! Not because it’s unfash-
ionable or anything like that. It’s just
that all dance music for me when I was
growing up was DnB, and the people
I hated at school used to listen to it.
That just kept me away from it.
In terms of producers, Switch is prob-
ably my favourite. He’s got talks about
this style of producing - but basically
just fucking with all different styles. So
like, throwing in a bar of dubstep and
then taking it back out and not sub-
scribing to any type of music. What he
does is completely his own thing.
Did you choose people Switch
and Riton yourselves to do your
remixes?
Yeah, we chose to Switch do the remix
of ‘Hideaway’, which is amazing. We
also have a Justice remix of ‘You Can’t
Fool me Dennis’ which our label set up
before anyone had even heard of Jus-
tice. Our label is really into that scene
so they manage to get producers like
Shoes, Riton and Zongamin to do our
remixes.
How did you create the effect of
you guys sliding up and down the
walls in the video for it ‘Young
Love’?
Well, we were on the floor on skate-
boards getting pushed by these guys
in white boiler suits, who I think were
the real stars in the video! It was a lot
of fun making that video but the new
one, ‘Two Doors Down’, was even more
of a laugh: it’s a pastiche of an 80s rock
video.
About your new album, you de-
scribed it as being more ‘radio-
friendly’, what does that mean?
For our first album we weren’t really
trying to make music to be played on
the radio - pop music as such - we were
more trying to do our thing which we’d
been doing for years.
For the second album, we started
listening to a lot more 80s pop mu-
sic, stuff that people would call cheesy
- Magic FM was all I listened to for
about 18 months. It probably rubbed
off on our music but you could ask
someone else in the band and they’d
probably snarl at the idea of Magic FM.
For me though, when I’m writing I try
and think of songs which would sound
good next to a Phil Collins song.
What are your favourite bands
right now?
I
da Maria is fast making a name
for herself in the indie scene,
surrounded by tales of intense
perfrmances and wrecked stag-
es. Music Felix caught up with
her for a nice chat and a sit-down.
Tell me a bit about yourself
I’m from a small town in the middle
of Norway called Nesna. There’s 2000
people there or something – not that
many people doing music. My father
and some of his friends were into it so
I used to play with my dad’s jazz band.
He’s in a reggae band now.
What encouraged you to get seri-
ous about music?
It was not a deliberate choice. I tried to
do all this other stuff. I tried to study,
I was studying music, philosophy and
literature. But I just needed to go on
tour, so it was a bit like, OK this is what
I am supposed to do.
Tours are kind of a two sided-thing,
it’s very intense but I love it. I think I’ve
never been as happy in my life as I am
now, I’m really really enjoying it
Can you give me a few words to
describe your music?
Energetic, colourful, full of contrasts,
spiky, sugary. I’ve found that whenever
you try to put music into categories it
doesn’t fit. It’s much more interesting
to hear how other people would de-
scribe my music.
What kind of venues do you prefer
to play in?
It doesn’t matter what size the venue is
or how many people show up or if the
sound is good or bad or whatever. The
only thing that matters is being able to
meet people. Play music and see what
happens.
What was it like to play on Jools
Holland?
It was really cool, it was a fantastic ex-
perience, really enjoyable. Jools was a
very nice guy. I met Morrissey and he
stank of aftershave. He seemed very
tired. It was very good to be there. It
was totally different to a live venue. In
a venue you can relax a bit more. It’s
cool to play on TV, but of course the
sound is different and you miss the
audience – you’re playing to so many
people you can’t see. We’ve been on
TV and on the radio, and you never get
your head around the fact that so many
people are going to see it or hear it. It’s
surreal. I heard myself on the radio to-
day, I didn’t see it was me, it felt like
someone else.
Where do you get the best
reception?
Playing here in the UK is really cool. I
can’t really say which countries I like
the best, they are all just different.
Swedish and Norwegian audiences get
really really drunk before they go to
concerts.
Your latest single ‘Stella’ is about
God falling in love with a prosti-
tute and so on. Where did the idea
for this song come from?
I wrote that song at Christmas. I was
so tired of Christmas, the whole re-
strictive tradition, the cosiness and the
warmth that was there just because it
was that time of year. I just wanted to
discuss God, put him down on Earth
and see what happens.
Interview by Peter Sinclair
I like a lot of American bands at the
moment. I like bands like Yaysayer,
Gang Gang Dance, Vampire Weekend
and Dirty Projectors. They don’t make
pop music as such but they put ele-
ments of West African music into their
own stuff which hasn’t been done really
since Paul Simon. I just like bands who
are fucking with the idea of a pop song
and who aren’t following the rules.
Is that more the direction in which
you’re trying to take your music?
In a way the album we’ve just made is
more straightforward, a kind of a gui-
tar album, whereas on the first record
we were trying to make really complex,
layered music. This album felt like
something we had to do, but on the
third album we might go a bit weird
again. We’ll have to see...
When’s that going to be
recorded?
God knows! We’re probably going to
be touring until Christmas so I don’t
know. There’s talk amongst us of mov-
ing to America, setting up camp over
there and seeing what happens. We’ve
been in London for a long time and I’m
up for seeing what living somewhere
else can inspire out of us.
