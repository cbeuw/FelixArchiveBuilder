Imperial Judo bring back medals from Sheffield
Wilhelm Kleiminger
This weekend the Imperial College
Judo Club and the University of Lon-
don Judo Club (ULU) went up north
to Sheffield to take part in the annual
BUSA (British Universities Sports As-
sociation) Championships. BUSA is
the highlight of the judo calendar and
the club has been building up towards
it for the last couple of months. For the
first time ever, due to the split from
the University of London, Imperial
entered their own team for the team
competitions.
After a 4 hour coach journey and the
weigh-in on Friday evening, everyone
went to a Chinese buffet in order to
stack up some energy for the fights.
With full stomachs, we quickly found
our hotel and went to bed because
the fights in the lower weight catego-
ries were due to start early the next
morning.
After a small breakfast on Saturday
morning, our lightweights took the
tram over to the venue. We had to be
early because the fights in the individ-
ual pools began in weight order with
the U-60 Dan and Kyu grades going
first.
In the highly competitive U-66 male
Dan category, Ed (1st Dan) got second
in his pool and went to the knockout
stage. Next on the mat were Hugh (1st
Kyu) and Rahul (1st Dan) in the U-73
male Dan category. With nine pools of
three, the entry for this category was
the highest at the tournament. Need-
less to say, competition was fierce. Un-
fortunately, Hugh was unlucky to get a
very strong pool with a 1st Dan and a
2nd Dan player and could not make it
to the knockouts. Rahul won both his
fights against players from Manchester
and Bedfordshire with Ippon, which
brought him to the top of his pool
and to the knockouts. With his hand
injured from Sheffield USIST, Eugene
(U-100) was unable to get past the pool
stage. Claudia, our only female entry
(U-57 Dan), missed the second place needed to proceed to the knockouts in
a close match with a Yuko score.
For the Kyu grades Imperial had two
entries. Wilhelm (U-66) scored three
Ippons which took him to the knock-
outs. Ben (U-81) won two fights with
Ippon against higher grades from War-
wick and Brunel and also went to the
knockout stage.
In the afternoon, the knockouts
started. Because of the huge number of
contestants in this category, the U-73
male Dan grades were to fight first.
Rahul was able to continue his formi-
dable display by a clear 1.31 minute
Ippon win over a 3rd Dan from Bath.
The next fight was a close match with
both players being very strong. After
going the full distance of 5 minutes,
Rahul lost due to a Yuko score. How-
ever, since his opponent from Hert-
fordshire went on to fight in the final,
Rahul got another chance to fight in
the ‘repechage’. After another win over
a player from Edinburgh, Imperial was
close to its first medal.
Nevertheless, the fight for Bronze
was going to be tough. Rahul was lead-
ing with a waza-ari, but the opponent
kept pushing him off the mat and Ra-
hul had to make sure he would not lose
the fight on penalties. In the end, Ra-
hul’s experience and stamina got us the
Bronze medal. Sadly, having lost his
first fight in the knockouts to a strong
Bath player, Ed did not get a chance to
fight in the repechage.
For the Kyu grades, Wilhelm, after
having escaped a hold-down five sec-
onds before the clock, lost due to a sec-
ond waza-ari by his opponent. Howev-
er, since the player from Southampton
went on to fight for Gold, he got an-
other chance to fight for Bronze. After
a quick Ippon over the judoka from
Bath, Imperial had its second Bronze
medal. Then Ben was on against Alex
from ULU. Unfortunately, only one of
us could fight in the semi-finals. Alex
won the fight by Ippon and went on to
win the Bronze medal for ULU.
After a long day of fighting we all
went to Nandos for dinner. We were
joined by Liang who had graduated
from Imperial last year.
So for the first time ever, Imperial
would enter its own team. Unsurpris-
ingly, we only had a male team. The
male teams consisted of 5 players
fighting in weight order. For Imperial
Eugene (-100), Ben (-81), Hugh (-73),
Rahul (-73) and Edouard (-66) fought
in the team competitions.
The Imperial team came second in a
strong pool with Oxford and Newcas-
tle. This meant that we were to fight
Cambridge next. With Eugene, Rahul
and Ed winning their fights, we went on
to fight Bath in the semi-finals. Despite
good fights, Imperial was outweighed
and outclassed by Bath. However, since
Bath went on to win the finals, Impe-
rial got the chance to fight for Bronze
against Warwick.
The first one to fight was Eugene. Al-
beit increasingly serious pain from his
wrist, he fought extremely well and laid
the foundations for the bronze medal
with 10 points. Ben and Hugh fought
well too but had to give in to stronger
opponents. Rahul continued to show
his skill and while in the lead, caught
his opponent shortly before the clock
with an excellent foot sweep. We were
back in the game. If Ed won, we were
going to get Bronze. Fighting a heavier
and stronger opponent this was no easy
task. Again, Ed showed some amazing
Judo against an increasingly passive
Warwick player. After having violated
various rules the Warwick player was
disqualified for 4 shidos in a row and
Imperial had won.
ICJC thanks everyone involved and
especially Alex from ULU for booking
the hotel.
