Fun & Games
Virgo
This week you
return to rapturous
applause. You
gracefully sidle into
your seat only to
realise that hottie
with the mega-zeps was actually strutting
her stuff two paces behind you. Damn
women. Always taking my credit. You hunt
her down lodging a fire hydrant between her
two anterior molars. Take that and smoke it.
Extinguish it yourself bi-hatch.
Scorpio
LOOK! LOOK!
L@@K GOOD
PRICE! TONY
BLAIR GORDON
BROWN AT THE
ROYAL ALBERT
HALL! SEE BELOW. ZOMG. WHAT WAS
HE DOING THERE?! I’ve never seen such a
dapper fellow as this here Brown one. I bet he
smells as good as he feels... Er. Come on, like
you’ve ever touched the Brown stuff! You’re
shitting me!
Libra
This week you have
exams. You drop
your pencil which
makes a jarring
clanging noise on
the wooden-effect
floor. Shunlucky, you’re now trapped in the
inevitable bubble of awkwardness that has sud-
denly encapsulated your frame of mind. Edge
out of your seat and grab the pencil or attempt
to make eye contact with the invigilator. Hmm.
Sagittarius

Capricorn
This week a light
bulb pings on
your head like one
of those Eureka
moments a miner
has when he’s stuck
in a mine and can’t find his way out because
there’s rocks and shit-guzzling-batfiends-
from-the-plains-of-D’Ang Orr hindering his
path. You suffer from Alzheimer’s though and
it doesn’t really register. Vegetable.
Cancer
Your friend has
an enema and
recommends you
to join him during
his next session.
Arriving at the clinic
you meet Hillary Clinton stepping out of her
large Chrysler. “How’d you think I maintain an
inverted chin as perfectly as this specimen?”
she quips. She’s surprisingly pleased to see you
considering how pungent your armpits are.
Gemini
This week you
discover that two
of your freshest
contributors are
absolutely batshit
fucking mentalist.
One of them pretty much just said that when
he had a six-pack back in ‘Nam he jumped in
this swimming pool with eight or nine little
children. I asked, why, like any sane individual
would. His response: “My abs were drying up
and I’d run out of ground-nut oil.” The fuck.
Leo
Des – what the hell
are you doing?! I
told you never to
use the pitchfork
when you get past
five-feet under!
Now look at the state of him! Give me the KY,
come on, pass it now. It’s no use – the damage
is irreparable. Not only did he die in a vicious
accident with a ban-saw in a woodmill, he’s got
three puncture wounds to his lower abdomen!
Sigh. You take the left, I’ll have the centre.
Taurus
Your interest is
suddenly piqued
by the thought that
there may actually
be imposters out
there who pretend
to compose horoscopes as awesomely as you
do. You head to that strange place known as
the internet-wide-web and a quick boggle
search reveals crazyhoroscopes.com... THIS
MEANS WAR! HEATHENS! BE GONE!
RETURN FROM WHENCE YOU CAME!
Aries
This week your
carrier pigeon flies
the nest in search
of more corporate
enterprises. Weeks
later it returns albeit
with added blacked-out sunglasses, a thin
leather briefcase containing a solitary sheet of
glossy white Conqueror paper “just in case”
and a pink pinstripe blazer. A swift wringing
and its neck no longer remains intact.
Pisces
This week you
publish the smallest
issue of the year.
Your member
shrinks ever so
slightly into yourself
especially since your boss is quite literally
piling on the pressure for you to buck up your
ideas. Literally too. You know, like Pressure =
Force over Area. It’s so bad you have to resort
to inane science jokes in order to connect to
your target audience. Sigh moan.
H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Aquarius
On a trip to South
Kensington tube
station you ac-
cidently step on
a crack in the
pavement. YOU
BLITHERING MORON. Didn’t you ever listen
to what your mummy told you? The paving
slabs separate and a purple tentacle lashes out
from beneath the ground barbing you in the
left kidney. Slowly your spleen disintegrates
and your eyes are pecked out by ravens.

Needy McNeedy: Strumming harps since ‘23
S
o my little pretties, it’s sum-
mer term again, and you know
what that means, right? Yep,
that’s right: sunshine and par-
ties! Oh, no, wait, don’t you
lot have exams? Unlucky. Email me on
agony.felix@imperial.ac.uk if you’re
losing the will to live, but remember...
Needy doesn’t believe in exams/like
moaning and so we’ll try and avoid all
mention of... oh, wait.
Dear Needy Mc Needy,
I live quite far away from home and my
parents just called me to tell me that
my cat (who lived with them) has died.
I’m really upset but everyone at col-
lege thinks it’s strange mourning a cat
that I didn’t see very often. How can I
remember Furry Muffler without seem-
ing weird?
SpinsterInTheMaking49
Dear SpinsterInTheMaking49,
I can completely understand what
you’re talking about: when I was in
the first year, my little sister ate my pet
hamster in a freak accident. If these
people who disapprove of your mourn-
ing aren’t your roommates, then I sug-
gest building a little shrine to your cat.
This also doubles as a procrastination
effort.
You could also try to find under-
standing people who aren’t chained
to their desks and believe that your
plight is worth the price of a drink or
two and therefore are willing take you
out to drown your sorrows. I fully be-
lieve these people exist and that they
are your true friends. Don’t give up
searching!

Dear Needy Mc Needy,
I have a dire need to spend all my wak-
ing time in the library chatting and
moaning about how much work I’m do-
ing. Unfortunately, my love of caffeine is
a direct contradiction to this pastime,
as the mean security men guarding the
library don’t let you in with any food or
drink. How can I keep up my caffeine
addiction and still spend all my time in
the library?
Headache
Dear Headache,
I’d love to help you smuggle caffeine
into the library, but the security guards
are on to me after they caught me not
looking at porn that one time.
Besides, if you’re going to take coffee
into the library for a gossip, you might
as well just go sit on Queen’s Lawn in
the sunshine rather than taking up
space. Unless the bastards put the mar-
quee back up.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
My girlfriend has just started a PhD
and now refuses to spend any time with
me. She says it will ruin her academic
image to be seen with an undergradu-
ate. She hangs out in the Senior Com-
mon Room and the Holland Club with
her new friends, and they make me feel
like an intellectual plebian. How can I
convince her that I’m clever enough to
be her boyfriend?
PhysicsUndergraduate
Dear PhysicsUndergraduate,
Given the obvious differences in food
quality between the JCR and the SCR,
she can be forgiven for not wanting
to hang around in the JCR with all
the Freshers when she could be chill-
ing with Prof Sir Robert Winston over
some gourmet meal, as we know all
postgraduates do at lunchtimes in the
SCR.
Are you trying to be better than Prof
Sir Lord Prof Lord Robert Sir Lord
Winston? Don’t, as he’s not only much
more intelligent than you, he’s also got
that amazingly cool moustache. You’re
fighting a losing battle, my friend. Why
don’t you try hitting on someone in
your own league, for example that girl
with the lanky hair you sit next to in
lectures?
If you’re dead set on winning this
girl’s affection back then you could
learn some handy intelligent things
from wikipedia to say in intelligent
conversations, for example: “Rather
than asking why cats purr, Roy Feinson
suggests the question is best answered
by asking ‘when do cats not purr?’”
[wikipedia.org]. This never fails to gain
people’s attention (not necessarily the
same as gaining their respect).
