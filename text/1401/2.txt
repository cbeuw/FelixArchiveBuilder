Stealth marquee emerges
and disappears again
College waved its largest wand yet by showing off the biggest
marquee to ever grace the Queen’s Lawn during the Easter break.
The marquee was erected for the Charing Cross symposium which
took place in April arousing stiff resentment from students who
were bewildered at its construction so soon after the previous
marquee was taken down and the Lawn was re-turfed at a cost of
£30,000–40,000. The grass is still standing proud despite the vast
intrusion; more marquees are due to return later this term which
we await with mounting excitement

Calls for mass disaffiliation
after NUS reformation fails
The National Union of Students (NUS)
Annual Conference was held this year
in Blackpool, with Imperial sending
nine elected delegates. After rejoining
the NUS last year, Imperial was hoping
that there would be signs of change in
the NUS, that the reforms passed last
December would get the two-thirds
majority ratification needed this time
round and give the NUS a new lease of
life.
With 717 votes required for the re-
form to be passed, only 692 voted in fa-
vour, meaning that the reform failed by
only 25 votes. Although the nine Im-
perial delegates were mandated to vote
for the reform, Camilla Royle decided
to break mandate and voted with the
‘Student Respect’ line who opposed the
ratification. This was not however an
isolated incident, as several delegates
from other unions chose to break man-
date, with these few votes making the
difference between the reform being
passed and calls of mass disaffiliation.
Universities such as Imperial, King’s
and University College London, which
have been branded as being on the NUS
‘rich list’ due to the fact that they con-
tribute the most to affiliations costs,
have brought up the prospect of dis-
affiliation. This would be a huge blow
to the NUS as they would lose sev-
eral hundreds of thousands of pounds
every year, as well as losing some of
their most influential and prestigious
universities. Petitions are already un-
derway at Imperial and it seems almost
certain that a referendum will be called
this term.
Other policies considered focused
on education, with the NUS deciding
to lobby for enforced education up to
the age of 18. This was opposed by Im-
perial as they wanted more efforts to
be made to offer viable alternatives and
encourage students to stay in educa-
tion voluntarily. The other big motion
of the conference was with regards to
the National Bursary Scheme which

would see money for bursaries being
allocated by the government. Imperial
College Union opposed this as they
feel that the money will not be spread
proportionally to their own students.
Imperial were generally poorly re-
ceived at the conference with Impe-
rial College Union President Stephen
Brown, as well as the ICU delegates,
being heckled as ‘Tories’ and ‘Right-
Wing Sabbaticals’. The best example of
this can be seen in a video of Stephen
Brown’s speech where he questioned
whether demonstrations were the best
use of the NUS’s dwindling resources.
The general opinion of the NUS
seems to be that the students have lost
control, with too much bickering be-
tween its members and with several of
them suggesting that the entire proc-
ess is no longer democratic. If the NUS
is truly going to be a voice of the stu-
dents, it needs to get it’s act together,
and quickly, or face a rebellion from
it’s most powerful and influential con-
stituent members.
