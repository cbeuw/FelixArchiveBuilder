Serve on the Union Court
The Union Court is a rather different
committee to any other in the Union. Its
function is to ensure that Union Officers,
returning officers and committees – including
the Council and Executive Committee –
follow the rules set down by the Union. It
acts as one part of the checks and balances
in the democratic functioning of the Union. It
also acts as the appeal body in all elections,
referenda, media disputes and some
disciplinary matters.
The Union Court is currently recruiting as
several members have recently left the
College. To sit on this committee requires
you to demonstrate sound judgment and
a sense of fairness to ensure that the
integrity of Union processes is maintained.
Serving on the Union Court will benefit both
the students of the College and yourself
personally as you will pick up a lot of useful
analytical skills that will help you in whatever
you end up doing after College. Union
Council appoints people to the Court which is
a very simple process. If you are interested or
would like to learn more please email me at
president@imperial.ac.uk.
New Evening Menu
At the start of this term we made a few
changes to the way we offer catering at the
Union. Many of the more popular dishes
such as pastas and jacket potatoes are now
available in dB’s, this is an effort to try and
reduce the queues in daVincis. Of course
daVinci’s will continue to serve the best value
freshly prepared meals on campus, whilst
dB’s will offer quick take-away food.
Meanwhile our new evening menu offers
quality cooked-to-order food with table
service. This has proved extremely popular in
the first few days of term, however, because
of this some people have experienced
unacceptable delays in receiving their food.
I would like to take this opportunity to
apologise for this and assure you that this has
been highlighted
to me and I am
pleased with the
steps that are
being taken to
avoid such issues
again. It seems we
are a victim of our
own success and
as of Wednesday
evening we were
serving three
times more meals than we did this time last
year!
Please do continue to use this great new
offer; we will be taking on extra staff in the
evening to cope with the huge demand and
our bar staff will continue to inform you
during busy times if there may be a delay to
your order.
