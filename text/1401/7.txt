Letters to Felix
Dear Felix,
Quick email:
I don’t appreciate the article you pub-
lished last week [issue 1,399; presuma-
bly the one titled ‘The Farcity of Varsity’
by [...] – Editor] and this [issue 1,400;
titled ‘Presenting the footballer’ by Lin-
nearse – Editor] having a go at football
club.
Freedom of speech is great... blah
blah, but things are getting a bit
slanderous.
Just purely from the Club’s point of
view, if freshers who didn’t join this
year were thinking about doing so
Tarnishing the
Football Club’s
reputation
next, then you’re putting them off.
I know you have a load of faceless
articles each week, but being able to
say all this crap without publishing
your name removes any accountability,
so they can do it freely with no reper-
cussions. Imagine if I decided to use a
pseudonym to slag off Choir soc and
call them a bunch of boring, lifeless
gimps. How well would that go down?
It would be rude, unfair and tarnish-
ing a whole group of people unfairly.
You published the homophobic article
(of which nothing came and yet we’ve
had to endure comments about it all
year), now you throw this in, together
with last week’s little dig too. Why?
Is there nothing better for Felix to do
than damage the image of the football
Club?
Who wrote the article?
Regards,
Those who are about to revise
Garo Torossian

Dear Garo,
I’m sorry you didn’t appreciate the ar-
ticle published in issue 1,400, written
by Linnearse. His column is intended to
be a satirical piece sending up the vari-
ous ‘collectives’ around Imperial, to be
taken with a pinch of salt. Certainly, we
received no similar complaints when
the depiction of the ‘Finance tart’ was
published two weeks earlier.
In answer to your other statements,
we were perfectly entitled to, and in my
opinion, perfectly correct to publish the
article reporting on homophobic chant-
ing in the Union. Our sources were
clearly upset by what they’d heard and
it was definitely within the public inter-
est to report on the incident.
I find your claims that [Insert Witty
Name]’s article was “a little dig” at the
Football Club slightly absurd. In the ar-
ticle, the author originally didn’t know
which sports club he/she was writing
about, demonstrating his/her general
apathy towards sports clubs rather
than one in particular. The article itself
was more about the lack of recognition
that the Arts receive at Imperial, in
comparison with something like sport,
rather than an attack on any club in
particular.
These comment pieces were sent to
Felix without request. Perhaps this is
something you should consider, that
people are using Felix to voice their
opinions; opinions that happen to criti-
cise your club.
I refute your question that Felix has
“nothing better to do than damage the
image of the Football Club?”. Rather
than addressing the comments in the
articles, you’ve chosen to take it up with
Felix. Yes, we choose whether to publish
the articles but we don’t necessarily
agree with them. Furthermore, there
were two letters responding to [Insert
Witty Name]’s article which we pub-
lished in issue 1,400 which raised some
perfectly valid counter arguments,
something you could have done if you
wished.
I think you’ve answered the ques-
tion of why people write anonymously,
with your final line: “Who wrote the
article?” Articles are written under a
pseudonym because the authors want
to make a point without fear of being
mauled afterwards. Whilst I don’t per-
sonally agree with writing anonymous-
ly, I can understand why people do it,
and without it many of the pages within
Felix would make for far duller reading.
Finally, I’m not at liberty to reveal the
authors’ identities.

T
wo girls sit in the Maths
library. Girl A is filing her
nails. Girl B appears to be
copying out Girl A's work.
Girl A: Make sure you change the or-
der or wha'ever so it doesn't look like
it's the same.
Girl B: I know, I am, look I put 'x plus x'
here instead of '2x'. How's Steve?
Girl A: We had a fight the other day.
Girl B: Oh, no! Was it about that night
when you got Big John to hold back
your hair while you puked when you'd
had all that Aftershock and told Simon
that you thought he was fit?
Girl A: No. I haven't told him about
that. It was 'cos I wanted to go out and
he was just playing with his Wii.
Girl B: Was that on Saturday?
Girl A: Yeah.
Girl B: You've got to go out on a Satur-
day. Is this an alpha or an a?
Girl A: Umm. Dunno, I copied it off
Lisa. Try and make it look like both.
Girl B: Shouldn't it be 2a anyway? Be-
cause you have to multiply by 2 when
you differentiate, don't you?
Girl A: Not always. Only if there's a
squared in it or wha'ever.
Girl B: Are you going to break up with
him for ever? You could go out with Si-
mon then.
Girl A: Maybe, yeah. Except Julie B
told me that he snogged Samantha last
night.
Girl B: No!
Girl A: I know.
Girl B: But she's so …
Girl A: I know …
Girl B: She's like, literally, the only per-
son I know that does her own work.
Girl A: And she's putting on weight.
you could see where her belt was cut-
ting into her gut flab on Friday.
Girl B: People shouldn't go out like
that. What's this word here?
Girl A: Point.
Girl B: And this?
Girl A: Inflection.
Girl B: And this?
Girl A: Of.
Girl B: What's a point of inflection?
Girl A: I think it's something you dif-
ferentiate. What did you do on Satur-
day, anyway?
Girl B: Went out.
Girl A: Where?
Girl B: Justin's party.
Girl A: Is he the one with the tattoo?
Girl B: He's got more than one. He was
playing drinking games with the guys
with chocolate vodka and he basically
showed us all of them. It was mental. I
think there are pictures on facebook.
Girl A: I can't go on facebook at the
moment because that weird guy, you
know, James, keeps poking me. He'll
probably see me in Online Now and
then he'll know I know he's poked
me and I'll have to poke him back or
something. Then he'll start writing on
my wall and Simon might see. Stuff like
that.
GIrl B: Is this graph supposed to look
like a V or a curvy V?
Girl A: Just draw it really small.
Girl B: Oh my God! Did you hear about
Vicks?
Girl A: No.
Girl B: Lisa said she's had sex with her
tutor and he gave her chlamydia and
she threatened to sue him or wha'ever
unless he gave her free lessons and did
all her work for her.
Girl A: Oh my God! Is that her tutor
for Methods?
Girl B: Yeah
Girl A: That's good. It's due in on Fri-
day and no-one’s done it yet.
Girl B: I know!

L
ook, let’s cut to the chase
here. I don’t have the time
to write this, you don’t have
the time to read it, so I’m go-
ing to give you a condensed
version of everything that has angered
me in the last four weeks, and then you
can read it and go on not caring. First of
all, if one more of you comes up to me
to ask for help with an exam subject,
after having spent an entire year being
a slimy and insulting sod, I’m going to
start feeding you wrong answers. Let’s
get one thing straight – I don’t mind
you pissing me off for eleven months
of the year as long as you keep it up for
the twelfth one.
Second of all, extra thick bread. I
make grilled cheese sandwiches be-
cause I’m a mighty warrior of the food
grill, not because I like the taste of car-
bohydrates and leaky dairy products. If
I buy extra thick bread, I expect to have
to get a tape measure out to work out
which side to butter. I expect my loaves
to be partitioned into exactly two slic-
es. A note to the Warburton family – if
you ever find yourselves down one of
Kensington’s many mean streets in the
evening, take a big stick or some burly
men because the Masked Griller will
be there.
Third – actually, let’s stop this. I can’t
think of anything good that happened
over the Easter period at all, so I don’t
know where this is leading... Other
than the beginnings of a wheat/chaff
separation over the river with my City
friends, nothing of note happened.
The ratio of funerals attended to child-
hood rivals kicked in the groin grows
onwards in the wrong direction, revi-
sion consists largely of reading things
I thought I’d read six months ago, and
the actual act of revising – hah! Don’t
even get me started on that.
Then there’s this general kind of dis-
taste that other people seem to have for
you if you’re a scientist revising around
this time of year. The kind of people
who say, “Lots of money in that!” when
you tell them what you’re studying, as
if careers fairs consist of Whores and
Cocaine stalls interspersed with fat
men in suits and top hats with big bags
of money hanging from their ridicu-
lous moustaches. Around this time
of year they switch to Ultra Patronis-
ing Mode like a particularly exciting
episode of the Power Rangers. “It’s just
maths, isn’t it?” they boom, firing lasers
from their eyes. Only this time you’re
not allowed to cave their head in with
a broom handle that you’ve engraved a
dragon’s head on. The judge won’t let
you off with a caution twice.
So yes, I’m a little down right now.
By the time you read this, the London
Elections will be over and you won’t
have voted, Boris will be well on his way
to making you wish you’d never been
born, and somehow through that I’ll
have to resist starting an underground
rebel militia and continue memorising
these pointless lists of failed research
projects. I don’t know how I do it.
What I do know is that in three weeks
I’ll be free again, and ready to get on
with life. What I worry about the peo-
ple I see cooped up in the library is that
they’re never really free of this. This is
what they live for – study and progress.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not exactly
Mr. ‘Facebook Event: PoSt-ExAm PiS-
sUp WAAHEEEY!’ here. But I see a lot
of people here who have never really
left their A-Level days behind them.
They’re cramming and regurgitating
like John Prescott at a finger buffet, and
god knows that’s not healthy. There are
two tricks to revision – spend five min-
utes not revising when you should be;
and spend five minutes revising when
you shouldn’t be.
That means taking a break from the
harsh lights of Level 5 in order to actu-
ally get outside, where the air is clear,
etcetera, possibly flying a kite. And
it also means not forgetting that you
study here for the other eleven months
of the year. Even the freshest faces at
Imperial will be all but done with their
studies by the time the next Mayoral
Election comes around. Think about
that carefully for a second this week,
and ask yourself if you’ve really grown
up since those days of hushed exam
halls and CVG Revision Guides.
