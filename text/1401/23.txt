Travels without my Aunt: Charing X
Theo Georgeiou Delisle tion, containing almost 98% asbestos
and 2% haribo. When you first arrive
at hospital you must first avoid falling
into the large moat that surrounds the
building, containing what the locals
affectionately call “flesh eating killer
carp” and navigate your way past the
Hammersmith Tramp © who patrols
the doors with an iron fist… and a
Stella.
Once inside it will become obvious
that you are on the wrong floor. You
therefore need to use the lift system
which the hospital is famous for. The
lifts themselves are packed full of arti-
ficial intelligence – so much so in fact
that they barely acknowledge the pres-
ence of a mere human pressing the lift
button on any floor, but instead move
as their whim takes them, pondering
the formation of outer echelons of the
universe between floors. This, there-
fore, means that you will be stuck wait-
ing at the lift entrance with a group of
strangers for anything between 5 and 6
hours before the lift arrives. However
this gives you the opportunity to learn
a little more about your fellow hospital
visitors;
– How did their tumour get that
big?
– How could a colostomy bag even
“¡Hola! You sir, yes you, you look
like a man who knows a deal when it
dances in your face wearing a pink bi-
kini embroidered with the words ‘I am
a deal’.”
“Who me?”
“YES, YOU!”
“But I am just working in the toilets
tonight, handing out the smelly soap”
“Exactly!”
“This makes very little sense to me”
“You might as well though, you’re
only young once.”
“I happen to be young twice actually,
once in 1986 and now.”
“Nice one mate.”
“Cheers”
“You want this deal then?”
“Go on, might as well.”
“….”
“You’ve just been scammed mate”
“MAAAAAAATE??”
“Yup, scammed good you were, he
just scammed you out of all your sweet,
sweet-smelling, smelly soap.”
“I have as well – I feel like a right
nincompoop.”
After a short and unpleasant break,
this article returns with less insight,
more lies and above all, slightly less
commitment. Having previously taken
you to such exotic locations such as
the Sainsbury’s near Earl’s court, and
that road near college – the one with
the tramp, I now ask your permission
to whisk you away to Charing Cross
Hospital. Located in Hammersmith, it
has recently been voted the 76th won-
der of the modern world, as the only
man-made, free-standing building to
be made from 87% pure asbestos, the
respiratory ward a particular attrac-
The elevator: A great place for contemplation
Try typing Charing Cross Hospital into Google – this is what you get
be incorporated into a padded bra?
– Why old hair makes a great and
practical coffee strainer
… are all questions which are likely
to be answered whilst waiting for the
illusive lift.
Away from the main hospital, why
not kick back and relax in Charing
Cross Library? Located conveniently
above the Reynolds’ Bar, it boasts a
range of entrances and exits which
operate on a monthly lotto draw as to
which will be working on a day-to-day
basis. As a fun experiment at the mo-
ment the library is juggling its collec-
tion of medical text books with reams
of transparent plastic sheet coverings
just to “mix up” the whole vibe of the
library, and before anyone gets angry,
it’s just a bit of fun.
It may be, dear reader, that it is fate
itself that nudges you in the direction
of the hospital as you are designated to
take an exam in Charing Cross Sports
Hall. In summary, taking an exam here
is not the worst thing that could hap-
pen to you, rape for example, springs
to mind as a less preferable alterna-
tive; however the sports hall is by no
means the ideal location for an exam
to be scheduled in. Firstly, call me
weak – willed, but the fact that the hall
is adjoined to its own bar is not condu-
cive to great examination preparation
– and neither is a pre-exam whiskey
chaser. Secondly, booming announce-
ments half-way through the exam ask-
ing, “The owner of a black Mercedes
to remove it from the forecourt”, can
sometimes cramp your style.
If all the fun and excitement of Char-
ing Cross Hospital is too much for you,
don’t worry – just head down to the
Reynolds’ Bar where, for this spring
only, you will be able to get your grub-
by mitts on one of the now legendary
“simply ham” sandwiches. Just ham,
and bread; no butter, no mayo, just
ham, and indeed to an equal extent:
bread. You know where you are with
this sandwich; you’re at home stroking
a big, golden Labrador whilst Connie
Huq tells you how to make Tracy Is-
land on Blue Peter: bliss.
