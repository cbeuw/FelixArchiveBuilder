CGCU President resigns
following mounting pressure
after No-confidence motion
The perennial condition of politically
active students having to No-confi-
dence at least one person per year has
led to the first scalp of the year. City
& Guilds College Union President
(CGCU), Tristan Sherliker resigned on
Monday citing that a combination of
personal reasons and the level of work
required of a final year student have left
him unable to carry on satisfactorily.
In the final issue of last term, Felix
reported on the No-confidence motion
proposed by CGCU members against
Mr Sherliker. They believed he had not
lived up to his responsibilities as Presi-
dent, specifically that his attendance at
Tom Roberts
Editor-in-Chief
meetings was poor and that he failed
to communicate with his colleagues
when they needed him.
During the Easter break the CGCU
held an emergency meeting to decide
on the No-confidence motion. The
paper was rejected and Mr Sherliker
remained in the role until earlier this
week when he announced his resigna-
tion. He has since said he would have
happily continued as President despite
the No-confidence, but personal issues
had lessened the amount of time he
had to spend in his position.
The Guilds will have to remain with-
out a leader for the rest of the term
since Monday night’s Council decided
to suspend the Presidential elections
until next academic year.

Union launches new evening
catering menu in daVinci’s

The Union has unveiled its new
evening menu this week, in an attempt
to improve the quality of food provid-
ed. Between 5 and 9pm every weekday,
students will be able to choose from a
variety of new dishes, cooked freshly
and then have it brought to their table.
Some of the old ‘favourites’ are still
available, including chilli and bolog-
nese. New additions made include a
6oz Aberdeen Angus burger and scam-
pi and chips. The Felix team went to
sample this new menu, with the food
getting some mixed reviews. Ordering
the food is simple enough, you just go
to the bar and order, then take a seat
and wait for it to be delivered. Expect a
wait of between 5 and 45 minutes be-
fore the food arrives though.
Once everybody’s food had arrived,
it was easy to notice that no change
had been made to the old ‘favourites’
whilst the new burgers that were of
a good standard. One question that
came to this reporter’s mind was why
did it take so long for some of the more
simple food (ie: jacket potatoes, chilli
and nachos) to be delivered, when in
the old system, the turnover was a mat-
ter of minutes.
On the whole its good to see the Un-
ion attempting to improve the quality
of its catering, and one hopes that as
time goes by, it will only get better.
Let us know what you think.

Writing-up student
wins court battle
Camden Council forced to withdraw Council Tax summons

Science Challenge
winner announced
Graduating PhD student, Matthew
Yong, was taken to court by his local
Council during the Easter break for
failing to pay his Council Tax, however,
Mr Yong successfully fought his corner
without the support of Imperial Col-
lege and on 20th March the case was
ruled in his favour.
At the end of last term (issue 1,400)
Felix reported on Mr Yong’s case after
he had just been issued with the Sum-
mons by the Camden & Islington Local
Justice Area. The dispute arose because
Mr Yong refused to pay Council Tax to
Camden Council during the writing-
up phase of his PhD. Most PhD stu-
dents enter this phase after they have
completed three years of their doctor-
ate and only their thesis remains to be
written. Students granted with writ-
ing-up status are not required to pay
tuition fees, however restrictions are
placed upon the amount of facilities
around College they can access.
More importantly, Imperial Col-
lege fails to recognise writing-up stu-
dents as full-time students which was
the cause of the dispute last term. Mr
Yong claimed that he met “all criteria
for being a full-time student” as de-
fined by Council Tax guidelines,
but Camden Council refused to
acknowledge this since College
wouldn’t provide a statement
that “confirmed the writing up
of his PhD constitutes continua-
tion of his full time course.”
Mr Yong was left to defend
himself in court but in the end
the judge ruled that he was “ob-
viously” a full-time student.
The result is somewhat of a
landmark case since many uni-
versities across the UK operate
with a similar attitude to their
writing-up students as Impe-
rial does.
The result will also lend
weight to the Union which
will be encouraging College to
revise its stance on writing-
up students when it makes
a presentation to Imperial‘s
Strategic Education Commit-
tee in May.
Mr Yong will be giving
an account of his
experiences in a coming issue of
Felix. Felix will also be publishing
a guide on how to deal with your
Council if they issue you with a
similar Court Summons

The winner of the Imperial Col-
lege (née Royal College of Science
Union Science Challenge...) Sci-
ence Challenge was announced on
Tuesday 18th March at the awards
ceremony held in the Science
Museum.
Erika Cule took home the first
prize for the Imperial Competition
with her essay entitled “How would
knowledge of my genetic makeup
affect my lifestyle?” which answered
the question set by Imperial’s Rec-
tor, Sir Richard Sykes.
For her troubles, she took home a
cheque for £2,500, a Macbook and also
won a trip to CERN to see the Large
Hadron Collider.
The winner of the Schools Compe-
tition was Hassam Al Halwaichi from
Sherborne School in Dorset. His es-
say answered Sir Brian Hoskins’ ques-
tion: “To what extent is geoengineer-
ing the solution to the climate change
problem?”
Hassam won £2,000 and a VIP trip
to the National Physics Laboratory in
Middlesex. Newspapers in his home
country Bahrain also picked up on
the story and his mother has received
many congratulatory phone calls.
Felix staffers who attended the
awards ceremony have reported that it
was an awesome event, so this author
would like to congratulate the organis-
ers for such an excellent competition.
Felix will be publishing the winning
essays and more in next week’s issue.
