We woke up very early for a Saturday
morning to take the 7 am train to Shef-
field.Everythingworkedoutasplanned
and we all met at Saint Pancras Station
to catch the train. We arrived at the
Club at Sheffield at 10 am and had 30
minutes to warm up and get ready for
the important matches.
First on court was our number 5
string Mike Gamblin who was replac-
ing our team captain Mitchell Hens-
man; who unfortunately had an impor-
tant commitment and couldn’t join us
for the finals.
Mike had a good start on the match
and maintained an early advantage in
the first two games to win 9/4, 9/2. In
the third his rival started to play better
squash and took the advantage 7-4, but
Mike recuperated and won the game
9-7 to give us the first valuable point.
In the other court, Harry Beeston
had already started his match and even
though they had some long rallies, the
Imperial student was always in control
of the T and won the first two games
9-3, 9-2. The third game was a lit-
tle different and the student from the
University of Birmingham had an early
lead, though Harry took the final game
9-7.
Then Ross and I (Federico Torres)
went to the courts, I had a slow start as
usual in each game, but after the first 2
points I dominated the match and was
able to put a good performance to win
3-0; 9-3, 9-2, 9-7.
Meanwhile, Ross Lillis at Number 4
was having a difficult time. He won the
first game 9-6 but lost the second 9-4,
though he had a comfortable win in the
third 9-1. Nevertheless, after that the
Birmingham student pulled off an im-
pressive performance to win the fourth
game 9-0.
The fifth was a very long game and
both players were tired, yet the Impe-
rial student had more energy left in the
tank and was able to finish the game
9-5 to win the match.
Last on court was our number 2 play-
er James Simpson; he played quite well
and the Birmingham team didn’t have
too much left after four losses. After
some good long rallies James won the
match 9-4, 9-2, 9-7.
With this win we are one match away
from finishing a perfect season, as we
are unbeaten in all our BUSA and ULU
matches, we won the BUSA Shield
championship, the BUSA league, the
ULU league and next term we will play
the final of the ULU Cup knockout
against Kings College.
We as a team will like to thank our
captain, Mitch Hensman, for all his ef-
forts in organising our training, match-
es and competitions and we would also
like to thank all the people from Sports
Imperial for their support.

E
xam time is upon us and I
wish you all the best of luck
in your forthcoming exams.
Since it is also the summer
period, the sports pages are
going to be a bit bare this term, so don’t
be expecting too many pages from me.
Hopefully the summer sports clubs,
will provide us with enough to actually
have a sports page, so look forward to
hearing from the cricket club, athletics
and maybe even croquet!!!
One of these weeks, once it seems
like everyone has finished their season,
I’ll do a round up of all the clubs and
pick out some awards such as Men’s
Team of the Year, Women’s Team of
the Year, Team of the Year, Club of the
Year, Individual of the Year and any
others I can think of!
Finally, since I’ll be the editor next
year, a new Sports Editor will be re-
quired. If at all possible I’d like to get
a medic student and an IC student in-
volved so that we can get the best that
both camps have to offer. So if you’re
interested email me at sport.felix@im-
perial.ac.uk
