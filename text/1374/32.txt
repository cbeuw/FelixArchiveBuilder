Hello fans of all things black, white
and quadrilateral. The Felix office
has become a bit of a manic place
and the ol’ guvnor has drafted me
in from my West Country retreat.
It’s time for a nu-skool-retro-
grade-fill-me-up-buttercup shiznit
ol’ timer crossword.
This one’s back from the crazy
hazy days of ‘00, when I was a wee
tot, probably in the second year
or something. I can’t remember.
Natch. Wasted. Ahh yeah, dem
ales tasted good back then. We had
proper tankards too, with a hand-
picked piece of barley to syphon
the nectar through. Except we
didn’t spit it out again.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
So you’re offended by
these horoscopes are
you? Well you can fel-
late all of my garden
gnomes in a skimpy
Russian outfit of my
choosing. Then I will YouTube this
act until everyone you walk past
for 3 months tries to come on to
you thinking you’re an easy lay.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
...the defendant Andy
Sykes was found to
have fhjes wskssokok
sofsbkb swmnwk and
also committed an un-
holy act of anal2iogrs
kjnjjns nnsn on the ljdlkjal of ICU.
Witness reports state wjdskncsjnn
but thankfully wldknmakjnk made
of cheese. Reports were vague.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
This week we take a
look at the art of self
excavation. That is
to say, in round about
terms, the process
by which one disem-
bowels one’s own kidneys with the
handle of a tetanus infected blunt
spoon. Spiritualism is the key to
enlightenment. Tango, bravo.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
I love it when you call
my name. I like the
sound of... lips lockin’.
I like the sound of...
hips knocking. I like
the sound of... beds
knocking. Oh do you? Well, I like
the sound of babies crying, legs
snapping, burning women and rab-
bits frying. Have some. Chunt.
This Week’s Isotopes
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
Your horoscope this
week isn’t that sur-
real. I’m sorry but
your Dalian excess
has dried up your Ma-
grittean exploits. No
bizarre objects will fall on you or
various animals indulge in sexual
activity with you. You should go
read a book, a good book.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
“Are these your shoes
sir?” Said the sailor.
“Why, yes they are, I
forgot all about them!”
Said Cynthia. “You
better watch where
you leave your clothes, someone
might get the wrong impression!”
He retorted. “Shut up and do me!”
She demanded, holding a weasel.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
This week Jupiter is
hiding in your under-
growth. There is a
likely chance you’ll
see God and/or Nelson
Mandela as a result
of said planet rummaging around
in your love constellation. Venus
is smiling at you this week, but
beware for she is a dirty bint.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
Wait! I ain’t done
with you yet! I will
force you to wear a
boiler suit filled with
shaving cream and
pig’s snouts and then,
oh yes I will make you recite the
whole of the American Constitution
backwards whilst having eighteen
pickles forced into your mouth.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)

Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
Maneater, make you
work hard. Make you
spend hard. Make you
want all, of her love.
She’s a maneater,
make you buy cars,
make you cut cords, make you fall,
fall in love. Maneater, make you
work hard, make you spend hard,
make you want all, of her love.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
Wowzers!!!! I mean

Dorset! CRAZY ASS SHIZZLE

all of them blind! Bad luck ey?
