Planned refurbishments to the Li-
brary have been blocked by West-
minster Council, meaning students
will have to suffer another summer
of roasting temperatures in the up-
per floors.
The College had to submit a plan-
ning application to the Council for
the changes it wished to make to
the building. The plans included a
number of changes to improve the
poor ventilation in the building.
These include extra vents and mo-
torised windows to provide fresh,
cooler air into the building.
These were to complement the
planned “solar shading”, which
would be achieved by dimming the
Library’s windows. This should
complement the otherwise poor
air conditioning and the extra
ventilation to reduce the ambient
temperature.
Westminster Council rejected
the planning application outright,
meaning none of the works can go
ahead. It seems the main objection
to the plans was a dissatisfaction
with the change of appearance that
would be caused by the solar chang-
es. This is somewhat odd, as the Li-
brary is almost completely invisible
from the outside of the campus, so
any change should have minimal
impact on the surrounding area.
Temperatures in the Library
have been a problem for the last
four years; it seems the air condi-
tioning system cannot cope with
the large number of students and
high air temperatures around the
summer revision period. The large
windows in the upper levels also
create a “greenhouse-like” effect
that makes the Library unpleasant
on sunny days.
The planning application is due
to be resubmitted without the solar
shading proposal, but it is highly
unlikely the other planned improv-
ments will prove sufficient to solve
the Library’s overheating problem.
The rejection should only slightly
delay these other changes.
The College and Union are look-
ing for support from local residents
for the shading, and are contacting
the councillors known to be friendly
to the College.
If you live in the borough, Felix
advises you to write to your local
councillors (you can find their de-
tails on www.westminster.gov.uk) to
express your disapproval.
Blaze at Albert
Hall Mansions
At 10.30am on Tuesday morning, smoke was spotted coming from
the top of the Albert Hall Mansions building (to the east of Beit
Quad). An hour later, more than 25 fire engines and assorted
support vehicles were at the scene. The fire blazed until late
evening, and Prince Consort Road was closed until the next day.
