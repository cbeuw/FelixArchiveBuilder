A good DPEW realises that univer-
sities cannot be run completely like
businesses.
Although making money is highly
important, the priority for Impe-
rial College should be education. I
feel a union bookshop on campus is
essential.
With Waterstones closing down
there is currently nowhere for stu-
dents to purchase books specifically
related to their course.
Have you noticed how there are
coffee shops opening up at every
corner of Imperial? Are we re-
ally the type of establishment that
wants to be trading books for a dou-
ble espresso?
I know that communication with
students is vital, and so all mem-
bers of the ‘Slate’ (Messrs. Gian-
nuzzi, Holland, Balikhin and my-
self) intend to hold office hours
where time is reserved specifically
to talk to students about anything.
One of the problems I have found
has been the lack of student in-
volvement in the running of the
union, which I will strive to rectify.
I would like to encourage all stu-
dents to feel compelled to raise
any issues they have with me.
Being a student – and that too, a
student in London – weighs heav-
ily on the bank balance.
I am deeply concerned about the
inflation of accommodation prices,
and I want to ensure that they re-
flect the standards of the rooms
available with particular attention
being paid to Southside.
Finally, I stand for all poli-
cies stated by other members of
the ‘Slate’. Vote Narayanan for
DPEW!

Imperial students often lack a Un-
ion identity. I intend to run cam-
paigns, driven by students at a
faculty level, to increase interest in
Union politics and facilitate better
development of ideas.
Entering the NUS is a key issue
for the Union this year and sup-
porting the development of a Sci-
ence and Technology Network will
ensure that we do not waste the
opportunity we have been given.
Additionally I will ensure that I
am available before office hours at
9:00am so that students know they
can find me in my office rather than
in a meeting.
Guaranteeing a place in halls for
first years is vital to retain our ap-
peal to students who would not oth-
erwise consider coming to London.
I hope to initiate an online forum for
accommodation issues as part of the
Union website with the view to sim-
plifying the housing process.
The Union needs to provide
healthier eating alternatives in Un-
ion catering and wider access to
contraception in halls. In order to
promote Imperial’s status as a so-
ciallyresponsiblemoderninstitution
I will support College’s commitment
to become a Fairtrade University. A
simple step that needs to be taken is
increasing recycling facilities within
College and the Union alike. A natu-
ral development is to reduce un-
necessary waste and use resources
more effectively.
This is a brief summary of some of
the ideas and issues I have raised in
my full manifesto. You can obtain a
