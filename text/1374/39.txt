Following an impressive perform-
ance and narrow loss to the expe-
rienced Cambridge Eskimos two
weeks earlier, the IC Devils were
prepared to unleash a hellish fury
upon their next victims and secure
their first win of the season. The
unsuspecting team happened to be
our arch-enemy: the University of
London Dragons. This local derby
is always a closely fought game
with the previous encounter result-
ing in an 11-0 victory for IC. This
year, with probably the strongest
squad to date, we were confident
of coming away with another big
win. The pre-game tension was as
high as ever and we gladly accepted
ULUs request to play full checking
and ensure a colourful match.
We arrived at Alexandra Palace
with three full lines and two goal-
tenders to find a very large mixed
ULU B team waiting for us. So large
in fact, that there was only just
space on the game record sheet for
all of them. After our fear-inducing
roar of “separate the man from the
puck” the match got underway and
IC skated fiercely from the start. We
kept the ULU Dragons pinned in
their end of the ice and tested their
keeper. It was clear that she was
struggling to hold onto our shots
and there were numerous chances
on the rebound. Chris Swearengin
finally gave us something to show
for our work and opened the scor-
ing with an unassisted goal mid way
through the first period. We contin-
ued to dominate ULU throughout
the first 20 minutes and finished the
period up 4-0. This was thanks to
another almost effortless goal from
Swearengin and one each for play-
er-coach Vince “old school” Miller
and former president Ed Grant.
The Dragon’s scaly armour had
been compromised but she wasn’t
finished yet. ULU held IC to a single

goal in the 2nd period while adding
one of their own despite solid goal-
tending from Mark McGillivray.
Meanwhiletherefereewaskeptbusy
with both teams making full use of
the agreed full checking. A general
lack of checking know-how and the
new “zero tolerance” rules resulted
in numerous penalties awarded to
both sides. A particularly bad check
to the head from the ULU number
77 on Miller forced him to drop his

gloves and throw a punch. This dis-
play of passion resulted in him leav-
ing the ice to join the large crowd
of supporters watching the match
from the stands. Our opponents did
manage to break out of their end a
few times but solid defensive play
and goal keeping from Ruth Cat-
tell in the 3rd period kept them off
the score board. Grant, Miller and
Swearengin put a total of five more
pucks past the rookie ULU keeper

in this final period and secured us
a 10-1 victory.
Despite the one-sidedness of the
final score, ULU fought for every
puck right to the end and kept the
eight strong crowd of supporters on
the edge of their seats. The rematch
this term promises to be just as ex-
citing but perhaps less physical fol-
lowing a post-match plea from the
referee. Special thanks go to Tom
Bell for time keeping and player of
the match Chris Swearengin (on
loan from the University of Minne-
sota) who scored two hat-tricks. We
wish him luck now he has returned
to the US.

Apparently these boys are devils; from this angle they look really rather sweet. Apologies for the Vanilla Ice title
