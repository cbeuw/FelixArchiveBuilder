Helping build bridges in Malawi
After several setbacks at the start
of the expedition, this determined
five-person expedition team from
Imperial College worked tirelessly
to construct a foot bridge across
the North Rukuru River near Ul-
edi in Malawi. Despite cautious
estimates, the bridge span turned
out to be greater than anticipated,
which forced major design changes
and added logistical complications.
Nevertheless, an original conserva-
tive schedule along with working
dawn till dusk seven days a week
meant the bridge superstructure
was completed within time and on
budget. Unfortunately, due to the
delivery of steel cable being fraught
with delays, the bridge was unable
to be completed. A return next year
is envisaged to finish the project.
The team was forced to stay in
Lilongwe longer than planned as
they waited for their luggage, which
had gone astray on their outbound
flight. Then when travelling north,
the team’s progress was halted by
a drunk man who ran out in front
of their truck. The team assisted
where they could but sadly the
casualty died that night from his
injuries. The police were informed
and formalities dealt with before
the team could continue.
Members of the team met and
discussed plans with senior officials
from the National Park headquar-
ters, and with Tommy Mhango, the
Nyika Parks director. These meet-
ings confirmed full government
support for the bridge, which was
emphasised as vital in order for Ul-
edi to become a fully functional and
effective anti-poaching scout camp
during the rainy season. Some park
staff had initial reservations over
the community sharing owner-
ship of the bridge. However while
there, team members persuaded
them this was in their best interest
in terms of looking after and main-
taining the bridge. Senior officials
agreed, and now the community
will have joint ownership status of
the bridge with the government.
The team went out with a very
flexible design centred on a sus-
pended type footbridge with mason-
ry towers, concrete anchorage and
a span of up to 30m which, based
on information available, was very
conservative. However initial sur-
veys revealed only one possible site
for the bridge, with a span of 37m
and flood debris a metre higher
than previously thought. Thus ma-
jor design adaptations were neces-
sary in order to make construction
possible.
The community displayed an ob-
vious enthusiasm for the bridge;
this being motivated significantly
by the prospect of paid work. All
communication with the villagers
was done through the four elected
chiefs of constituent areas, via
the National Parks chief resident
scout at Uledi Camp. Impromptu
progress meetings, which were at-
tended by the chiefs, park staff and
the team, were held on site when
issues arose. A total of forty-five
workers were employed at local
rates clocking up some 4800 man-
hours between them. Feedback
from those employed was generally
good though the work was harder
than many had anticipated. This
resulted in a 25% pay rise to keep
them happy. Several workers suf-
fered from minor aches, strains,
cuts and bruises, with injured
feet being the most common. The
team ensured all were attended
to, though other than the cleaning
of wounds, most of the first aid was
carried out more for psychological
benefit than by necessity.
Materials were sourced locally
where possible and hence the ma-
jority of the workforce was em-
ployed to extract and carry rocks,
gravel and sand up or down river
to the site. Only ten people were
needed at any one time for the ac-
tual excavation and construction
work. Mzuzu was the nearest town
where cement and steel could be
bought, which involved a three day
round trip. Three journeys were
made due to the volume and weight
of cement required and the load
capacity of our truck. Bricks were
purchased locally however a track
had to be cleared before they could
be reached. Seven truck-loads of
bricks were required to move more
than 6000 bricks which were used
for the towers. All supplies brought
in by truck had to be manhandled
from the road end at Uledi Camp
down to the site and across the riv-
er as necessary.
Two 4.4m high mixed masonry-
reinforced concrete towers, with
1m deep foundations were built
together with two anchor blocks
each made from 6m¬3 of bulk fill
reinforced cement concrete. The
free span between the two tow-
ers is 36.7m, with a total super-
structure span of some 60m while
the height of the towers allows
for 1.6m freeboard above highest
known flood levels. Also fabricated
were the 0.7m wide timber-decking
units, made from termite resistant
blue-gum wood. These are easily
replaceable due to their simple de-
sign, and since wood was supplied
from the National Parks saw mill at
Chelinda.
With the concreting complete,
it was left to cure and a four day
round trip was embarked upon to
Lilongwe to collect the steel cables.
However the consignment was still
stuck in Europe somewhere as all
freight had been removed from the
plane to make room for urgently
required school exam papers.
With nothing more to do, the team
cleared the site, making sure eve-
rything was safe and secure, ready
for the team’s return in a year’s
time to finish the bridge.
The team is currently organis-
ing this year’s expedition which
will complete the construction of
the bridge and undertake neces-
sary bank protection work. The
team still needs a few more people
to help them carry out this work in
Malawi from the 1st July to the 2nd
August 2007. So if you are interested
in joining the expedition, please get
in touch immediately – the team is
particularly keen to hear from any-
one with a civil engineering back-
ground or knowledge. Email daniel.

The Imperial College Building
Bridges 2006 expedition was only
made possible through the support
given initially by Imperial College
Exploration Committee and subse-
quently by many other individuals,
organisations, companies and trust
funds. The team expresses their
sincere thanks for all these con-
tributions for without this support
the expedition would not have been
possible.

tion about organising your own
