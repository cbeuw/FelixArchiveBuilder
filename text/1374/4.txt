Depressed little Britons?
What has happened to this nation?
In a report by the United Nations
Children’s Fund on the 12th Febru-
ary, Britain came out as the worst
country in the industrialized world
in which to be a child.
The charity UNICEF gauged 40
separate indicators to measure
children’s lives in 21 of the world’s
most economically advanced na-
tions. This was the first study of
its kind. Unfortunately, it found
Britain’s children were among the
poorest and most neglected.
On key measures of poverty and
deprivation, happiness, relation-
ships, and risky or bad behaviour,
the study showed that Britain con-
sistently came out with low scores
“All countries have weaknesses
that need to be addressed and no
country features in the top third of
the rankings for all six dimensions,”
said David Bull, UNICEF UK’s ex-
ecutive director.
However, Britain’s appalling re-
sult begs some serious questions,
are we in a cut throat, dog eat dog
society?
Jonathan Bradshaw is a professor
of social policy at York University
and one of the report’s authors, put
Britain’s poor ratings down to long-
term under-investment in children
and a “dog-eat-dog” society.
“The findings that we got today
are a consequence of long-term
underinvestment in children,” said
Bradshaw, who is a professor of
social policy at York University in
England. Colette Marshall, UK di-
rector of charity Save the Children,
said the report was a “shameful”
verdict on Britain. She said “drastic
action,” including an injection of 4.5
billion pounds, was needed to meet
a government target of halving the
number of children in poverty by
2010.
In medical psychiatry, there has
been much discussion about child-
hood unhappiness. S Timimi S in
a paper entitled “Rethinking child-
hood depression” says tot her effect
that to diagnose major depression
in children is to medicalise the un-
happiness caused by affluence, per-
missiveness, a decaying family and
society.
However, Joseph M Rey and
Michael J Dudley contrast this view
in a number of articles entitled “De-
pressed youth, suicidality and anti-
depressants”, by stating that medi-
cal practitioners and governments
Flu, flu, all over the world and spreading...
have been told during the last
quarter century that depression is
a serious illness that can lead to
suicide, poor physical health, and
personal, professional and social
difficulties. Thus, the international
mental health community has in-
vested considerable resources in
trying to tackle this scourge.
Unfortunately, some of the prob-
lems when dealing with a ranking
system is that it is simply a form
of relative ranking. Overall, teen-
agers might be adversely affecting
the results by being more vocal
(yes I mean moaning) about their
ailments, relationship problems or
life’s work.
It does not necessitate that they
are objectively worse off, rather
they just perceive to be, and further,
we cannot objectively tell in units
of happiness how much more un-
happy they really are. Perhaps un-
happiness can be in certain cases a
course for drive?
After all of this discusion, home
organisations and governemnt do
need to monitor the situation fur-
ther, and with a higher degree of so-
phistication in order to objectively
discern how happiness is felt as,
opposed to how much better off that
particular individual is. As this sur-
vey is the first of its kind, I presume
it will be quite some more time until
a more refined conclusion is built.
If expert clinicians disagree, it
is little wonder that the public is
confused, yet severely depressed
teenagers will continue to come to
doctors for management.

Just how do you measure who is happier?

H5N1 avian influenza finally struck England last month in Holton in sleepy Suffolk
I
know that the constant and
repetitive feeling of Déjà vu
is getting to you know, but it
should. We are going to see
a lot happen in the next few
months.
All I can say is that it is in the
American government’s best inter-
ests to keep Iran neutralised. The
pressure is mounting. Plans for a
massive military strike have been
unveiled, and President Ahmadine-
jad is in the lowest diplomatic po-
sition he has ever been in before.
Criticism of his foreign policy rhet-
oric (concerning Israel as well as
Uranium) and his poor record on
promised reforms at home have
been the primary objections. As a
result, 150 members of the parlia-
ment signed a letter blaming him
for raging inflation, soaring food
prices, high unemployment, and
failure to deliver a budget on time.
This with an overwhelming defeat
in December’s local elections, ulti-
mately means that that power has
shifted over to the pragmatists.
This shift may (or may not) bring
peace - but what is teh price to the
Iranian people of this move? Will
their interested be observed by for-
eign powers, or usurped?
Oh yeah, er um, say something
more relevant, ooh, er, perhaps
about the Union? AHAA! Get more
envolved! Yes. Whoever said thiat

160,000 turkeys lucky enough to
have survived the Christmas cull,
instead found their final resting
place in a gas chamber after a di-
agnosis of H5N1 avian influenza
was made on a farm in Holton, Eng-
land. 2,500 birds died initially from
the virus on the Bernard Matthews
owned property, Europe’s largest
turkey producers and famous for
products such as frozen ‘turkey
drummers’.
The discovery comes a month
after the disease was found in
Hungary, and a year since France
saw evidence of an outbreakSo far,
H5N1 has claimed the lives of over
200 million of our feathery friends
all over the world. Avian flu is a mild
disease, often not life threatening
in wild birds.
However, H5N1 is a highly patho-
genic strain, and according to the
World Health Organisation (WHO),
may claim up to 100% of contami-
nated animals within 48 hours, af-
fecting respiratory tracts, organs
and tissue.
That it is a highly contagious
disease, and that birds reared for
the food industry are kept in such
confined environments, presents a
huge risk to agriculture and any na-
tion’s economy.
After the French outbreak in Feb-
ruary 2006, poultry sales plunged
by 30%, and only recovered half a
year later. Chickens are the main
a contaminated animal; poultry
raised to a heat above 70 degrees,
and strict hand washing practices.
It is, however, the practice of home
slaughter, common in many devel-
oping countries, which significantly
increases risk of infection.
There has been much investiga-
tion into any human cases because
many scientists fear a mutated ver-
sion of the virus, one that spreads
just as fast between humans and is
equivalently fatal, will bring about a
new pandemic. Influenza pandem-
ics have so far been periodic in hu-
man history, with the worst case
occurring in 1918 with the ‘Spanish
Influenza’. That episode claimed an
estimated 40-50 million lives world
wide. The WHO warn that, with all
necessary precautions in place for
a human outbreak, a pandemic to-
day may result in a global death toll
of 2 million.

On Saturday, the same day as con-
firmation of the outbreak in the UK,
Nigeria reported a deceased 22 year
old woman with traces of the virus,
thought to be the cause of death. It
is estimated that 165 people have
died as a result of H5N1 since 2003,
though in general, human infection
is rare. The WHO states that prop-
erly prepared food is enough to pre-
vent getting the disease even from
product, accounting for 70%, of a
European food sector worth 20 bil-
lion euros annually.
A 3km zone has been drawn
around the farm, restricting the
movement of birds and moving
them indoors. A further region en-
compassing all within 10km of the
infected farm is to be subject to
intense monitoring by Cobra, Brit-
ain’s emergency planning commit-
tee, and the Department for the En-
