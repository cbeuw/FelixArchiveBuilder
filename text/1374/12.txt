NUS delegate

Some of you may find my candidacy
rather peculiar as it wasn‘t that long
ago I was badgering you to vote No!
during the referendum. The NUS
has many faults and I am flattered
that several members of the Yes
campaign agree with me. Since the
referendum I have been working con-
structively with them to ensure that
the chances of us reforming the NUS
are maximised. Imperial has voted to
join the NUS by a narrow margin so
lets make sure they keep their prom-
ises. Elect me as delegate and I will:
• Vote as Union Council instructs
me to.
• Disrupt the passage of motions
that are irrelevant to students as stu-
dents. We want the NUS to deliver
on top up fees, not waste time and
money debating the pros and cons of
“solidarity” with Venezuelan Trade
Unionists.
• Elect the NUS leaders whose poli-
cies are closest to those of ICU.

I firmly believe that the NUS,
as a body formed to look after
the interests of students, has no
business spending its time com-
menting on foreign affairs.
I was strongly opposed to Impe-
rial’s NUS affiliation because of
its tendency to do so.
As an NUS delegate I will not
only represent the interests of
Imperial College students when
voting (and not for any political
motive or ideal), but will also
report back on the conference,
identifying any strengths and
weaknesses.
Conference is an expensive
business for the NUS and ICU,
this year we have the opportu-
nity to help make it better value
for money.
Vote for a delegate who cares
about students and the financ-
es of your clubs, and not about
politics.
Ashley Brown
This conference is our first big
chance to make our voices heard
within the NUS since we joined.
When I lead the ‘yes’ campaign
I didn’t pretend that the NUS is
perfect: reform must go wider and
deeper to make our national union
more accountable to you and ce-
ment its financial viability.
By actively engaging with the
NUS we’ll get the most out of our
membership. I’ve been working
with the no camp to draw up rules
for our conference delegates to en-
sure that they represent all Impe-
rial students rather than align with
political factions.
Elect me as your delegate and I
pledge to work to keep the confer-
ence focused on issues which mat-
ter to us as students, to push for
reforms to realise the full potential
of the NUS and to work with other
conference delegates to report back
to you on our activities.

Last year I was one of many stu-
dents who campaigned long and
hard for Imperial to say YES to the
NUS. As such it should come as no
surprise that I passionately believe
in the need for a strong national
voice for students - the voice that
NUS provides. This year I have al-
ready worked with NUS and seen
the work it does campaigning for
students’ interests – not just on top-
up fees but I wide range of issues
from housing to healthcare. But I
have also seen the problems within
NUS – from overstaffing to certain
groups constantly trying to talk
about issues which don’t affect stu-
dents. However, those at the top of
NUS realise the problems and are
working to change the organisa-
tion. If elected I will strive to ensure
that the much needed reforms are
implemented and that NUS contin-
ues to fight, and win, for students.
Vote Ben for NUS delegate.
Ben Harris
I actually campaigned against Im-
perial joining the NUS. I believed
that, on balance, it wasn’t worth our
money. But now we’re in – narrowly
– all ICU members have a duty to
make sure the NUS works for us.
We need delegates that represent
the sceptical middle ground, who
aren’t interested in NUS politics
and gossip. I’m standing as some-
one keen to have a conference that
focuses on relevant student issues
like debt, housing and employment.
I will seek a frank and open dialogue
between delegates and our Union
Council, to achieve the unity of pur-
pose necessary for ICU to make any
sort of impact. I hope that the public
speaking skills I have developed as
president of the debating society
might be put to good use in articu-
lating an honest, representative
voice for our student body. Let’s go
to conference with a solid, achiev-
able plan, and make it happen.
Ed Hunt
I led the No! Campaign last year
passionately believing that for
Imperial College Union to join
the NUS is the wrong thing to
do.
This is why I am running in
this election to become an NUS
delegate.
I want to see for myself first
hand whether I was right or
wrong.
Also to I want to ensure the rest
of the delegate team will act as
one representing our students.
After all, our union has paid a
substantial amount of money not
to the clubs or societies but to
the NUS and I will make sure it is
money well spent.
James Fok
As a campaigner on a range of is-
sues on campus I have seen the
effects activism can have.
I am part of the ongoing actions
against top-up fees but I believe
that the only way to successfully
stop fees is to work jointly with
other universities.
That’s why I voted to join the
NUS.
But the NUS needs reform, it
should represent the views of or-
dinary students and be made up
of activists, not bureaucrats.
The government’s neo-liberal
agenda doesn’t stop at fees. The
climate of Islamophobia resulting
from war in the Middle East has
hit universities hardest.
Research at “elite” universities
is being increasingly dictated by
the needs of the private sector
and cuts to public services such
as the NHS will become more
of an issue for us especially for
the large number of medics at
Imperial.
Camilla Royle
Imperial needs delegates it can
trust.
Campaigning on all the im-
portant student issues must be
done with energy and skill.
As the Political Philosophy So-
ciety President, I have worked
for nearly two years in bringing
prominent speakers to Imperial
to debate some of the most con-
tentious contemporary issues.
As the Politics Editor of Fe-
lix, I am actively building
awareness of the wider global
picture.
As a fifth year medical stu-
dent, I have been around a
long time, got to know many
good people at Imperial, done
enough time, and got enough
experience to know what is go-
ing on.
I believe I am in an excellent
position to help you get the rep-
resentation you need, and keep
you informed about the issues
you want to know about.
Omar Hashmi
Hi people, the main issue that’s
going to be hanging over the nus for
the next few years will be the top up
fees. I’m strongly against the top up
fees and feel that the NUS have not
as yet done enough to stop it. I also
oppose the war and the subsequent
attack on civil liberties. While many
argue that the nus should only con-
cern itself with topics that affect
students directly, I believe that our
opinions while be taken more se-
riously if we spent the preceding
year involved with the wider issues
around us, rather than just debat-
ing 10% discounts for kit-kats. Hav-
ing said that, I’d like to add that I
have no opinion either way regard-
ing 10% discounts on kit-kats.

What do these
delegates do,
anyway?
The National Union of Students
is a coalition of student unions
from around the country that
aims to change government
policy by acting for all the un-
ions involved.
The delegates will attend
the NUS National Conference
in Blackpool, which takes on
three days in March.
The referendum to decide
if the Union should affiliate to
the NUS said that we would be
joining.
As such, ICU can now send
delegates to the NUS National
Conference to debate on what
NUS policy will be for the next
year.
Things that will be discussed
include top-up fees, student
debt, housing issues, and so
on.
ICU Council has decided that
the delegates should vote as
they are told by Council. This
means that our delegates will
not be allowed to join any po-
litical or religious faction at the
Conference (for example, Stu-
dent Respect), nor vote against
what Council have mandated
them to do so.
Other candidates running (did not submit manifestos)
Timothy Wilson, Emma Persky, Umar Patel, Andreas Koukos,
Kirsty Patterson.
