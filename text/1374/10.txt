If you vote for me; I’ll suck you off
faster than a stoat gets trapped in
a tractor. I’ll spit dem rhymes; I’ll
commit some crimes; and I’ll be the
deciding factor.
I like Wotsits; so there will be
more Wotsits in the union. Ooh;
sumptious cheese-based snacks.
I hate all races equally and so
will be breaking wind in various
cupboards. I am a true follower of
fashion as I have been known to
wear both grey and purple. I will
bring a tragic irony to the Union
constitution. There will be more
fish battles in half-naked aban-
don. I will wish death upon you
and your anticlockwise flushing
appliances.
I will flick my snot at passers-by
and then pretend I am a Hungar-
ian parsnip harvester. I will make
sure you close your windows to
stop those sexy ladies coming
in and distracting you from your
studies.
If I am elected I will hurt you. I
will brand you with an iron made
of pure hatred formed in the fires
of Mount Doom. Only then will you
become my children – I will make
love to your eyesockets after ren-
dering you blind with a pick-axe.
If you vote for me; I will intro-
duce more lesbians into various
clubs and societies’ committees. I
don’t agree with them; but at least
they like the flange. I will make
sure your existence is a constant
chore by making Felix out of fibre
glass and puppy dog’s tails. I will
then poop in all your amenities
whilst singing the Welsh national
anthem.
On a serious note: You can vote
for RON if you don’t think any
candidate is suitable. Electing
RON will restart the elections.
Re-Open Nominations (runs for all positions)
I’m a third year physicist and a re-
app at Southwell Hall.
I’m 5’10” with dark hair and a slim
figure, looking for a funny, dark-
haired girl, preferably with a good
dress-sense, for fun, maybe more.
Felix is bland this year. If you want
the same again next year, vote for
one of the other people (reverse psy-
chology, don’t actually do that).
I want Felix to be fun and less up-
tight, it is a student newspaper at
the end of the day.
My Felix will be a lot more like it
was last year under the legendary
Rupert Neate, i.e. nail-biting excite-
ment and drama from start to finish
10/10. It will cater for a less narrow
range of readers.
Here are my proposals for next
year’s Felix:
1) Investigative journalism. Ap-
parently nothing happens at Impe-
rial. Fair enough, but those of you
who were here last year probably
remember the Felix editor trespass-
ing in all the halls to expose hall
security.
Felix can make news. My Felix is
going to get involved, find out what
matters to students and investigate.
2) More writers. Felix needs up-
scaling. I’ll attract a greater range
of writers to keep more people
interested.
3) Pay rise for Felix editor.
4) The Oxford English dictionary
defines naked as “without clothes”.
Why are my centrefold models not
naked??
5) Coffee break with Lou and
Andy
In a nutshell, if you elect me as Fe-
lix editor I’ll make it a lot more en-
tertaining and light-hearted.
Felix Sinclair
Felix has changed dramatically over
the last few years. Under Rupert,
the news teetered on the tightrope
of sensationalism, whereas this
year’s Felix has maintained a bal-
anced stance and more professional
approach. However, this has been
at the expense of some of the light
hearted content. If elected, I will
bring the best of both worlds.
The comments section will contin-
ue with its debate on topical issues
like gay adoption and veils, but I will
bring back Neighbours discussion,
Stormy Woods and other easygo-
ing material. An emphasis will be
placed on regularly returning col-
umnists too.
Page 3 has lost the essence of
what made it so much fun as well.
I intend to guarantee that women
and men have an even representa-
tion whilst ensuring the photos are
more tongue-in-cheek and taken at
familiar college locations.
I will introduce a global news page
briefly summarising the world’s key
events as well as a photography
page. There will also be a greater
presence at the Freshers’ Fair to
recruit more staff and beef out the
current sections, some of which
have only appeared sporadically
this year. I will maintain the Fe-
lix website and create an informal
feedback system so that we can lis-
ten to your views.
Felix has played a major role in my
life at university and I’ve loved writ-
ing for it. Technically I’ve gained a
vast amount of experience this year
as deputy editor. I promise to push
myself hard if you elect me and ex-
pand upon the good work of the pre-
vious editors.
Tom Roberts
I’ve been writing for Felix since my
first year and have been Arts Edi-
tor since 2005, nurturing the Arts
page into a regular section.
I’ve developed lots of PR contacts
and my writers get access to Lon-
don’s most important Arts events.
I’m a 4th year mathematician but
I’ve spent most of my time at Im-
perial doing lots of other things!
I sat on the summer ball com-
mittee, worked in the Union bar,
played netball and as well as my
first love Felix, I am currently a
Pimlico Volunteer and RCSU Hon-
orary Secretary.
I will bring Felix out on Thurs-
days again! Being distributed
on Friday lunchtime as it is now
means that many students don’t
get a copy until Monday, when the
news may well be out of date.
I want more features and inter-
views in Felix, and a bigger science
section. I plan a ‘News in Brief’ sec-
tion with news about student activ-
ity in other inferior universities.
I want Felix to hold Sabbs ac-
countable for their decisions and
promises, and report on what
changes to the Union mean for
students.
But it’s not just about news. To
keep you entertained in boring lec-
tures, I plan to resurrect the legen-
dary FUCWIT league, print more
puzzles, games and have funnier
comment.
I will be bringing in new ideas
and contributors to keep Felix
dynamic and evolving. As for our
beloved centrefold; boys, girls, ani-
mals, statues - I’m not fussed.
Ambitious plans.
Experience coming out of my
ears.
Vote Emily for Felix.
