Imperial College Winds, now in
its tenth year, is a non-audition
group of wind, brass and percus-
sion players who like to play for
fun, enjoyment and sociability. Our
repertoire includes a wide range of
styles from traditional English folk
music, to modern film scores – in-
cluding Jurassic Park, James Bond
and Star Wars – to suites from West
End musicals, with just about eve-
rything in between!
For the last three years we have
had the pleasure of being con-
ducted by Gilly French. Gilly is an
acclaimed conductor and joint ar-
tistic director of Bampton Classi-
cal Opera, a small company with a
national reputation for its revivals
of rarely-heard eighteenth century
opera.
The band usually has two end-of-
term concerts a year, at Christmas
and Easter, one particularly memo-
rable concert being an impromptu
outdoor concert performed be-
neath the Queen’s Tower on a cold
December lunchtime!
This term has seen Imperial Col-
lege Winds playing in our first con-
cert outside Imperial. The band
travelled to Bampton in Oxford-
shire, the home town of our conduc-
tor, for a fund-raising concert in St
Mary’s church, which raised over
£600 for reparations to the church
roof. The concert was a great suc-
cess with the hugely appreciative
audience filling the entire church
giving a real buzz to the evening.
The programme featured an ec-
lectic selection of pieces, including
Symphonic Marches by John Wil-
liams, Second Suite for Wind Band
by Gustav Holst and the band’s cur-
rent favourite film score Chicken
Run by Powell/Gregson-Williams.
The concert has since been the
talk-of-the-town amongst the local
people in Bampton and the band is
invited back next year to perform
again. The band greatly enjoyed
performing in a new venue and
were given such excellent hospital-
ity, so will look forward to a return
visit next year!
Imperial College Winds has been
the catalyst for the formation of two
new groups at Imperial College – a
clarinet quartet and a flute quartet
– both of these quartets performed
at St Mary’s church playing two
contrasting pieces. The flute quar-
tet performed The Blue Danube
by Johann Strauss and the clarinet
quartet performed Cinerama by
James Rae.
This term has also seen Imperial
College Winds giving its usual con-
tribution to the hugely popular Arts-
Fest 2007. Performances included a
joint concert with Contraband and
also a slot in the prestigious Grand
Finale concert.
The band welcomes musicians of
all standards and abilities. If you’re
a new, returning, or ‘occasional’
player (ie once a week at rehears-
als!) then we’re the band for you!
On the other hand, seasoned or-
chestral players who often forget
just how challenging and rewarding
playing in a wind band can be – a
real test of skill and stamina with-
out a string section to back you up
– also have fun playing with us!
So, if you like the sound of Impe-
rial College Winds then why not join
us? Simply come along to one of our
rehearsals, which take place in the
Great Hall or Ante Room, from 6pm
to 8pm on Tuesday evenings, or
contact our chair Richard Jones at
richard.jones@imperial.ac.uk.
Or come along to our end of term
concert on Wednesday March 21st
2007 in the Union Concert Hall.
Imperial College Winds are “talk of the town”
The IC Windband jamming in a recent concert
ICU Dance Company win again!
all four pieces looked amazing and
the dancers all did Imperial proud!
Hildur, Francesca, Wei Li and Sarah
Winstanley had once again showed
their talents as choreographers
and the dancers held their own and
really owned that stage.
We proudly retained the contem-
porary title, and added to the col-
lection by winning jazz with prob-
ably the cheesiest piece of dancing
ever seen, but we did love dancing
it! With our heads held high and
our smiles still cheesy we hit Edin-
burgh for the celebrations.
At an amazing little Mexican res-
taurant we ate, drank, sang and
some danced (I am thinking Louisa
and Colin here) the night away to
the tuneful sounds of our very own
backing singers Sarah, Alvaro and
Kathy, also known as New Kids on
the Block.
Some special dancing inspired
by our favourite superhero Spider-
man was probably the highlight of
the night! The next morning we all
headed back down south to once
again join the masses of London,
thankfully Louisa didn’t need to
change her watch, Ayish could once
again use her phone and London
was once again safe now Spider-
man was back in town.
It was an amazing weekend for
everyone in Dance Company both
ArtsFest and Edinburgh crew alike,
and with more performances lined
up in the next few weeks the fun is
sure to continue! A massive thank
you to all the dancers I hope you
all had as much fun as I did and
bring on Edinburgh 2008, we will be
back!
What a weekend, night, days of re-
hearsals we have had! Everyone
with ICU Dance Company has been
working really hard towards our
performances and competitions
that February had in store. By far
our busiest weekend has just gone
by!
In the week running up we took an
active part in ArtsFest in both the
dance marathon on the Wednesday
afternoon and 27 of our dancers in
the Finale Concert on the Friday
night.
In a piece choreographed by
Hildur Einarsdottir, Francesca
Garrard and Wei Li Cheah, three
styles of dancing, tap, ballet and
contemporary were brought to-
gether in one dance. The fusion of
three styles created a visually stun-
ning piece, using dancers of all abil-
ities to truly demonstrate the talent
within Dance Company.
A trip by 26 of us the same week-
end up to Edinburgh (there is no
time difference Louisa, and yes Ay-
ish your phone doesn’t require in-
ternational roaming) started on the
Friday night with the long journey
up north!
Edinburgh University Modern
Dance Society run a competition at
the Pleasance Theatre every year,
this year we had entries in jazz, tap,
ballet and we were proudly defend-
ing our contemporary title from
2006.
In beautiful costumes that both
Chiara and Lily had slaved over,
including the sexy big black pants,
we took to the stage in style and
