We were standing on the edge of the
dancefloor when it began to take
hold. I remember saying something
like ‘What’s with all the bearded
hippies?’ None of my companions
replied but I thought they’d soon
notice that we were deep in hippie
country.
Itallstartedwithanunnecessarily
long wait under an arch in London
Bridge. The smell of hair filled
the air with dread. Delboy wasn’t
helping either, ‘Pills? K? Charlie?’
Who is this Charlie-boy? And why is
he in such high demand? I would’ve
asked Del but couldn’t help but be
distracted by the spinning carousel
in the distance.
Minutes passed – sixty of them,
in quick succession. That’s the
problem with these hippies – all
that free love gets the better of
them and they end up guest-listing
half the fucking city.
Once we’d made it through the
guest-list gauntlet, the first order
of business was to familiarise
ourselves with this new world order
of fairies and pixie-dust. I found
myself clutching a map and vaguely
remembered a fluorescent beard,
or had it just been one of Delboy’s
little helpers? Who knows? Not me,
that’s for sure. All I knew was that
there were seven dirt chambers
ready for our intrepid exploration.
Somehow we managed to stumble
through the grinning masses
and found ourselves bouncing
around to Fromem-Ory’s hypnotic
psy-trance.
The sounds were hard and
crunchy like a bowl of Special K, and
the bassline practically knocked
us to the ground. The room was
heaving, the atmosphere intense,
but the air conditioning was non-
existent and the dancefloor no-
smoking. We had to escape and
made our way through the maze of
tunnels by following a midget on a
pogo-stick.
We were intrigued by his
promises of a brave new world,
and found ourselves in a smaller
room; a somewhat calmer place
but still retaining the air of potent
psychedelia. The music was more
electronica-based with a hint of
IDM (no, I didn’t know what the
fuck it was either but I’m sure you
can find a Genre Nazi to fill you in).
Here, we smoked, we re-hydrated,
and we tried to chat but despite
our best efforts (believe me, we
were really very keen to chat) we
couldn’t make ourselves heard
above the pounding beats. We
stayed for a while; getting to grips
with the inflatable insects proved to
be trickier than we’d first thought.
As we sat there watching the
crowds, it became clear (not
literally – by this point, everything
was a very unclear fucked-up fuzzy
mess) that something peculiar had
happened to this place and the
people that loved it. The endless
tea served-up in porcelain mugs
had been replaced with Malibu and
cokes, sipped by trendy kids with
asymmetric haircuts. It was too
clean and sterile, ever so slightly
chavved-up and at 20 quid on the
door, not exactly accessible to all.
In years gone by, those grimy
arches had been home to some of
the most legendary parties seen
in the late 90s UK rave scene.
The Drome, as it was then called,
was dingy and filthy and fucking
wonderful; no room for any kind of
door policy then, let alone daring to
charge more than a fiver.
For a while there it seemed as
though Synergy was successfully
breathing new life into a faded and
dull London club scene, almost
resurrecting the unique squat
party atmosphere created by The
Drome and The Warp Experience,
but somewhere along the way it
had lost its charm. Maybe we were
getting cynical in our collective
old age, or it could just have been
that intoxicating whiff of something
unfamiliar in the air. Whatever it
was, something had changed.
It was at this point that my raving
comrades and I realised that we’d
had our eyes shut for a significant
period of time; a small crowd had
gathered and we thought it was
probably time to get the fuck up.
With a little help from our new
friend, Nick, we found our feet. We
realised that despite our grievances
we’d actually had one hell of a
night.

Win tickets!
It takes a certain type of DJ to
play all night long. Rather than
whip out your set of peak time
bangers for the last two hours
you have a whole nine hours to
fill. Not only is that one heavy
bag of records, but it means a
fair amount of genre juggling.
Even the most fervent and en-
ergetic clubber might be feeling
a little jaded after nine hours of
solid minimal techno.
Mr Danny Howells, however,
is one those DJ’s who relishes
the chance to play all night.
Equipped not only with the
stamina, enthusiasm and blad-
der control to play from start
to finish, he has a record col-
lection that can keep the most
cynical, weary club-goer glued
to the dancefloor the entire
night. Never mind taking you
on a journey, it’s a full on expe-
dition requiring tent, ice pick,
provisions and a compass!
Dig Deeper always brings
that special touch of Howells
magic to the dancefloor. With
a friendly up for it crowd who
aren’t afraid to show their ap-
preciation, and a DJ whose pas-
sion for making people dance
will never tire, Dig Deeper has
grown to be an essential night
in the club calendar.
From March, Dig Deeper is
moving to a Saturday, giving you
that extra hour to take in the fin-
est selection of Deepsexyfutur-
istictechfunkhouse™ through
till 7am. Since even Danny can’t
be in three rooms at once, up in
AKA Freak Luke Soloman will
be bringing his Little Creatures
to town.
Alongside gerbils, guineapigs,
squirrels, and other animals of
the vertically challenged dis-
position, expect to be jumping
up and down to house, disco
and techno, from deep to dark,
from hands up to heads down.
EMAIL IN TO WIN.
