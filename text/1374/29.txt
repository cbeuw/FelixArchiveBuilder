Halo 2 multiplayer – the guide
Azfarul Islam is here to kick ass and chew bubblegum. He’s fresh out of one of them, and it’s not ass.
M
uch to chagrin of
the burgeoning
population of fan-
boys, allow me to
start off with my
personal shock-and-awe campaign:
Halo 2 is ludicrously overrated.
The single player campaign, at
least. Let’s say that the story is
disappointing with some poorly
judged pacing near the end. In fact,
the main campaign is quite forget-
table after an initial play-through in
Co-Op. Despite being an extremely
polished game overall, it lacks any
particularly stand-out attribute
that might thrust it into the upper
echelons of gaming.
All but one … the multiplayer.
Combining and subtly balancing
the brisk pace and sheer insanity of
Unreal with the tactical stratagems
and team camaraderie inherent in
Counter-Strike, Halo 2 stands as
one of the finest multiplayer games
in existence.
One of the key attributes that
makes the multiplayer in Halo 2 so
brilliant is that it’s extremely intui-
tive and playable like no other. Cou-
pled with a refined control scheme
that allows most gamers to adjust
within a matter of moments, this
is one of the few games that you
can unashamedly bust out at a
party and get most people intensely
involved.
The life system uses a shield-
based mechanism; there are no
health pick-ups. Initially, all dam-
age is borne by your energy shield
– once that’s depleted, you’re re-
duced to a sack of flesh that’ll die
after being pumped with a few bul-
lets. However, the shield regener-
ates over time, particularly when
you’re immobile. This allows you
to strategically retreat and rejoin
the fray with gusto. This ingenious
feature allows for an ever-shifting
vie for supremacy and allows the
fun to continue as long as you can
hold out.
The weapons are ingeniously de-
signed and it’s quite obvious that
each one was laboriously custom-
ized to be unique. Since there are
a few basic types, the fact that you
can only carry two weapons on your
person creates a real need to find
your own niche.
Halo 2 also allows you to use a
variety of vehicles, some unique
to particular levels. Each one has
been carefully crafted to offer ease-
of-use – and significant mauling
capabilities. It’s possible for dexter-
ous players to eject the opposing
occupant of a vehicle (get up close
and use X) thereby coming into
ownership, however temporary, of
said means of transport. The blood-
bath ensues again.
It’s also quite clear that much
love was put into each level since
the majority boast fantastic design
sensibilities and architecture that
maximises the gratification gamers
will receive.
Halo 2 is indeed the ultimate mul-
tiplayer game … in my opinion,
pitchfork-wielders and CS zealots
take note.
With my unabashed arse-kissing
complete, let me properly introduce
you to The Guide to Halo 2 Multi-
player. Note that this applies to of-
fline, split-screen multiplayer only.
For online games on Live! many of
points brought up are equally appli-
cable, but some aren’t.
Like most games of the multi-
player ilk, Halo 2 offers your basic
gameplay variations such as Slayer
(Free-for-all Deathmatch), Team
Slayer (Team Deathmatch), Cap-
ture the Flag (Self-explanatory),
Assault (Take bomb, plant bomb
in enemy base, run away scream-
ing like girls) and Territories (Hold
onto your own land while evicting
your opponent off theirs). There
are other slightly newer types such
as Oddball (hold onto a skull and
survive – talk about ominous) and
Juggernaut (If you’re the Jugger-
naut only you can score; whoever
kills you becomes the Juggernaut).
Each of these modes have quite a
few integrated variants of their own
centring around specific weapons
or modified stats. Fortunately, the
game allows a well-proportioned
degree of flexibility when creating
custom game modes or even edit-
ing the built-in types.
A common moot point for Halo 2
is bots (AI controlled opponents), or
lack thereof. When you have enough
people around, it’s quite trivial but
when there are only two or an odd
number of gamers, their absence is
sorely felt.
Like most RPGs, Halo 2 offers
you the ability of customising your
avatar. Of course that’s not saying
much when you’re just a guy in a
tin suit … high-tech or otherwise.
Besides the Spartan class (the type
of soldier that the protagonist, the
Master Chief, is) you can select
being a Covenant Elite (alien bad-
guys; ugly). There aren’t any par-
ticular advantages to either besides
a personal cosmetic preference.
However, after extensive play you
may find that the Elites are more
difficult to get a bead on with a snip-
er rifle due to the sunken anatomy
of their heads. Plus, they look great
in Pink, which is more than can be
said for Master Chief.
Head on over the page for an in-
depth look at Halo 2’s finer points.
