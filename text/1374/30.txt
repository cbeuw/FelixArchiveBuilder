Boom, headshot! Highlights from Halo’s arsenal
Magnum: Unlike the first Halo,
the Magnum has been toned down
to a discreet side-arm. You must
depress the trigger repeatedly for
each shot. By itself, it’s a rather
useless weapon unless your foes’
shields are down. When coupled
with an SMG or Plasma Rifle/Pistol,
this becomes rather deadly again.
Submachine gun (SMG): A basic
SMG with a fast rate of fire that’s
ideal for use in close- and mid-
range combat. One disadvantage is
that the clips tend to empty rather
quickly and there’s a significant re-
coil that invariably causes you to
slowly start aiming skywards. Dual-
wielded, these are formidable.
Battle-Rifle: A weapon that mar-
ries the rate of fire of the SMG with
the range and scope of the sniper
rifle. A Battle-Rifle is deadly in mid-
and long-range skirmishes; an ac-
curate player can down foes from
huge distances. Since it fires in
bursts, the recoil is less pronounced
than that of the SMG. At close-
range, however, this is a foolish op-
tion, unless wielded with care.
Shotgun: The ultimate weapon
for close-quarters combat. A sin-
gle headshot spells instant death
for foes (and friends alike, for the
trigger-happy). The sound is par-
Full circle – mastering Halo 2 MP in ten steps
The Plasma Sword – Putting the “Ace!” into “God, no, not the face”
Here’s a quick run through on
how to be the master, er … Master
Chief. Sorry about that one, enjoy
anyway:
1. You may find it advantageous
to change the look sensitivity in the
options menu. A slower degree of
sensitivity is good for players who
tend to rush others or shoot locally;
faster levels are a must for skilful
strafers.
2. I cannot stress enough the im-
portance of experimenting to find a
weapon configuration that plays to
your strengths. If you prefer to be
in the midst of all the action, then
close-quarters weaponry such as
the Plasma Sword and Shotgun are
imperative, coupled with an SMG.
At range, the Battle-Rifle or either
sniper rifles can turn you into a god.
Try mixing and matching various
Spartan and Covenant weapons to
form part of your arsenal.
3. Learn to use each grenade
type to its strength. The frags will
bounce a bit before exploding, al-
lowing you to set up kill-zones with
good aiming. You can bounce them
around corners or into sniper hides
for maximum effect. Plasma gre-
nades are adhesive and will stick to
both players and vehicles. You can
turn your opponents into suicide
bombers or make up for the lack of
a bazooka when against a vehicle.
4. Teamwork is absolutely essen-
tial in matches. Being able to co-
ordinate attacks and offer support
to your partner will truly bridge the
gap between a loss and victory. It’s
imperative to communicate plans
to your comrade otherwise you
could end up in embarrass-
ing collateral damage (i.e.
team kill) situations. It’s
an ideal combination
when at least one of
youisadecentsniper
– if not, at least one
should endeavour
to take the place of
a sharpshooter with
the other watching
your back.
5. The lock-on
capabilities of the
Plasma Sword offer
a bit more strategy
than you’ll realise.
ticularly satisfying. Interestingly,
it’s possible to pull off a shot in the
midst of reloading – however, you
have to had inserted atleast one
shell. You’ll also find that despite
being a rather in-your-face weapon
it can still chip away at range, too.
Sniper-rifle: One of most popular
weapons in multiplayer gaming,
this can be one of the deadliest too.
Skilful (or lucky) players may even
be able to line up headshots without
a scope. The range is in two levels of
zoom: 5x and 10x (click in the right
stick to switch between them). At
long-range, single headshots are all
it takes to bring down opponents.
However, when your scope is in use
you can’t see your motion sensor
or your surroundings and sneakier
players will love to creep behind
you, wait to rub it in and then me-
lee you to death. At close- and mid-
range, you might as well stand still
and die quickly.
Bazooka: One of the nastiest sur-
prises you can give to anyone in
Halo 2. This is a weapon that can be
used to level the playing field when
the other team keeps ‘splattering’
you with a Covenant Ghost. The
bazooka boasts significant splash
damage and is particularly useful
when the other team is grouped
together – preferably in a tight cor-
ner. The bazooka can lock onto en-
emy-occupied vehicles with some
trigger-stroking. One disadvantage
is the ammo is extremely limited;
however, this is a weapon that is po-
tent at all ranges and can swing a
battle your way.
Plasma Pistol: Not exactly
equivalent to the Magnum, this lit-
tle weapon fires out small spuds
of plasma that nibble away at your
shield. Useless unless you charge
it up – when that happens, you un-
leash a crackling ball of pure en-
ergy that depletes your opponent’s
shields to nil. Slaughter as you see
fit.
Plasma Rifle: A lot more potent
than the SMG, the plasma rifle has
a higher rate of fire as well but that’s
offset by the fact that it overheats.
When that happens, the weapon
jams and you’re a sitting duck.
Covenant Carbine: Often es-
chewed for the superior Battle Ri-
fle, this rifle is quite the weapon. It’s
faster than the BR and is equally
capable. However, the ammo ca-
pacity is limited and not as precise.
In the hands of skilled players, this
is still deadly.
Plasma Sword: A truly nasty
piece of work depending on who’s
wielding it. It locks on from range
(wait for a telltale red crosshair)
and allows you to charge for a sin-
gle kill in a very anime-esque way.
In large maps, it needs tactics. In
small maps, go wild with it.
Covenant Needler: Like a porcu-
pine rifle, it fires pink crystals that
adhere to the body and explode
within seconds. It can actually lock
onto energy sources like the shield
and slowly bring it down. If you
dual-wield Needlers, you can rap-
idly kill.
Plasma Grenade: While it doesn’t
bounce around, it does stick to ve-
hicles and more sadistically, people.
It has its strategic uses in that a
stick guarantees a kill, for vehicles
as well. Being able to stick someone
accurately will make you a force to
be reckoned with.
If your foe is above or below you
and the sword locks on, you’ll actu-
ally fly towards him, defying all laws
of physics in the process. You’ll find
specific levels where this comes in
very handy.
6. When armed with a Plasma
Sword or Rocket-launcher do
not equip either as your primary
weapon if in the open. The
Plasma Sword is an
inviting beacon
to snipers even
if you’re invis-
ible, whereas
the Rocket-
launcher
obscures
one-third
of your
vi-
sion. Also, it’s a lot more gratifying
when your enemies blindly rush you
only to find you whipping out the
sword for death by impalement.
7. I may sound rather daft, but
choosing the right colour in Team
Slayer has more benefits than is
immediately obvious.
Red, orange, and brown make it
harder to see you in earthy maps
whereas blue and green work well
in the shade and urban areas. Cam-
ouflage is particularly useful for
and against snipers.
8. Try playing with a handicap on
to really improve your skills and
generally hold bragging rights.
Even if you lose, you could still
say you were handicapped; it’s a
win-win situation. A handicap will
decrease your life bar, the damage
your weapons do as well as increas-
ing the time taken for your shield to
regenerate.
9. If you screen-watch, you suck
and should be b[efriended].
10. Have fun and don’t get upset
when you lose. Good sportsman-
ship is the key to getting the most
out of multiplayer.
