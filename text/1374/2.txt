Albert Hall Mansions blaze
Traffic was brought to a halt around
the Royal Albert Hall and Prince
Consort Road on Tuesday when a
fire broke out in the upper floors of
the Albert Hall Mansions building.
The building has often housed
students from the College, though
they generally rent the cheaper
flats in the basement level.
At around 10.30am, smoke was
seen around the upper floors of
the building. Members of Imperial
College Security were first on the
scene, and the Fire Brigade ar-
rived shortly afterwards. Within an
hour, more than 30 appliances had
arrived, and the road outside the
building had been closed.
According to the BBC and other
news sources, the fire started in a
penthouse flat. Some sources are
reporting that it is owned “by a Mid-
dle-Eastern businessman.”
The flames were first spotted by
builders working on scaffolding on
an adjacent roof, who had to scram-
ble quickly to the ground after a
window exploded and smoke began
pouring out. A maid who was in the
building at the time was rescued
by firefighters from the upstairs
windows.
By lunchtime the fire had spread
into the roof and into the floor be-
low. Firefighters could be seen in
the third floor windows attempting
to spray water onto the fire.
The Fire Brigade have said that
part of the roof had collapsed, and
there were concerns over ceilings
in the lower flats collapsing due the
amount of water being poured onto
them from the roof. Thin and suf-
focating smoke spread across the
road into Hyde Park, blanketing the
surrounding area with a unpleas-
ant-smelling fog.
The builders also had the fore-
sight to remove gas canisters from
the immediate scene of the fire,
and firemen could be seen remov-
ing more canisters later in the day.
Mutters of evacuation were heard
coming from Fire Brigade radios as
the fire continued unabated.
Fire in the roof of the Mansions building covers South Kensington in thick smoke and
closes down access to the Union by road for the whole of Tuesday

tions were in progress until late in
the day. When this reporter left the
bar at 10.30pm, a large number of
appliances were still in attendence.
It is not yet known what caused
the fire.

Waterstones
in Library
closes forever
The Waterstones in the Library has
closed for good, with low sales be-
ing cited as the reason.
The College outlet has competed
with the store on High Street Ken-
sington, which is only ten minutes
walk away, and has a much larger
stock.
There have also been complaints
that the College branch is more
expensive than the Kensington
branch, even for the core business
of textbooks for IC students.
The strength of Amazon’s UK on-
line bookselling business has also
hurt sales, with many books being
out of stock at the College branch
and orders often taking more than
two weeks to complete. Amazon
has a much larger range, and has
many more textbooks in stock.
The vacated space is now planned
to become a 24-hour “supercafe”, in
order to complement the 24-hour
opening of the Library throughout
much of the year. The Library is
generally open far later than other
buildings on campus, and those
working there at night lack a place
to buy coffee or snacks (apart from a
trio of unreliable vending machines
in the Haldane Collection section of
the building).
