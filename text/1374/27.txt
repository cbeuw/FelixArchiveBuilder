I, Gamer

ultiplayer is
a Garden of
Eden for gam-
ing. From the
early days of
Spacewar!, it was all we had.
There was no “AI” and most of
the challenge was supplied by
your opponent (the other part
of the challenge being the size
of the machine it was being
played on). But it was fun, and
gamers were without shame or
derision.
Then came The Fall. Evil
Pac-Men and pixelly aliens
whispering sweet nothings into
the ears of Player Two, and
before you know it someone’s
gone and eaten from the tree of
eternal life, and we’re left in a
barren land of poor level design
and forced to cover our naked-
ness in the shame of FMV se-
quences starring Z-List actors.
Yeah, even James Earl Jones.
It’s been a long few decades
in the wilderness, but it’s clear
now that multiplayer gaming
has re-established itself – not
just for PC Gamers, and not
just in front rooms, but as a
global way of gaming. Persist-
ent online worlds, dynamic
64-player conflicts, seamless
data sharing over always-on
connections.
We look at both sides of mul-
tiplayer this week – at one ex-
treme, tens of thousands of
euros up for grabs in the first
big gaming event of the year – a
trend growing the world over.
And at the other end, playing
the Spacewar! way, with all
the players kept safely within
punching distance for a Halo 2
Slayer match.
Single-player gaming can’t
die, because Pac-Man – howev-
er evil the drug-taking cheese-
ball is – was right; other gam-
ers can’t always be there to
play with. But looking at how
far single-player gaming has
come over the years – from a
missing ball and a high score
through to non-linear japes in
the Elder Scrolls – the pros-
pect of multiplayer being given
a chance to play catch-up is an
exciting one.
Of course, there are inher-
ent problems with multiplayer
gaming, and the technological
demand is huge. But the con-
soles and the PC hardware
seems up to the task now, and
that means the change needs
to come from developers. Indie
breakthrough acts don’t come
all that frequently in the mas-
sively multiplayer arena – but
maybe now that will change?

This week in videogaming
When Zone of the Enders, or Z.O.E.,
was released in 2001, some – if not
most – of its sales were down to
the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo is
carried free with it. A cheap trick,
or clever brand sharing? Which-
ever, there’s a sense of deja vu this
week as Crackdown finally reaches
the store shelves, and the Halo 3
Beta Pass that it comes with finally
reaches the 360.
Leaked screens and videos of
the 360’s biggest big name disap-
pointed many fans, but the true
hands-on beta will let them see the
new weapons and levels first-hand
– and after all, we really doubt that
Bungie could have broken a win-
ning formula like Halo quite that
substantially.
Winning formulae abound this
week, with the release of Final Fan-
tasy XII after years of waiting. For
those of you that didn’t crack under
the pressure to import, HMV will
be hosting a launch event on the
Friday 23rd at their Oxford Street
store, around 12 p.m. Cosplay com-
petitions and extra giveaways for
the early buyers will at least make
daytime London look a little inter-
esting. We’d suggest getting there
early if you do intend to get any of
the freebies.
The last-gen is fading, though, de-
spite fresh releases such as FFXII;
however, the next-gen remains in
a state of deadlock. The 360 is still
shunned in Japan, but a report out
this week suggests a similar story
in the West. Nintendo have man-
aged to distance themsevles from
the mainstream bitch-fighting, but
Sony’s wonder machine is appar-
ently being kept on the shelves
by the 360, performing well on its
home turf.
It’s not hard to see why, as they’re
essentially banging their heads
against the same commercial
rock week in, week out – latest an-
nouncements include a confirms
120Gb 360 upgrade to be released
this summer, and research into a
slimmed-down Playstation3 using
new CELL production technology.
By contrast Nintendo’s design
guru, Shigeru Miyamoto, spoke to
CNN about his hopes that Nintendo
A bunch of cocks reform to publish games – Electronic Arts nowhere in sight?
Gamecock’s games promise a wide variety of unusual design approaches, like Mushroom Men (above)
would “pull away” from Sony and
Microsoft, and assert themselves
as a very different kind of brand.
More good news from the inde-
pendent publishing world, as the
fragmented Gathering of Develop-
ers (GoD) reforms in a manner of
speaking, under the label Game-
cock Media.
The new house hopes to have a
collection of next-gen games out
in 2008, but the principle of GoD’s
reformation is more important, as
it raises hopes for a stronger inde-
pendent force in the new year, es-
pecially with Steam’s repertoire of
struggling developers continuing to
grow.
Finally, Tesco have managed to
plug a loophole in their pricing
systems which led to them giving
away XBoxes for free. Till prices
were showing up £2.61 more than
the shelf price for a 360 Premium
system, and that meant – under
Tesco’s customer care policy – that
the product went to the shopper for
free. It wasn’t an isolated incident
either, as many other electronics
items went for free over the Christ-
mas period. Tesco’s return-and-
refund policy has now been swiftly
abandoned.
