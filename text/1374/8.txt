As President I will represent stu-
dents to the best of my ability.
I will take student issues to
council and be the voice of the
student body.
Since I am in my second year
I feel I have the benefit of being
both accustomed to the ways of
the university long enough to
take on the responsibility of this
post as well as having an insight
of the demands of all students.
The clubs and societies at Col-
lege are very important to the stu-
dents and I would like to maintain
the funding that they receive.
It is clear that Imperial is Lon-
don’s leading university academi-
cally, however in terms of the so-
cial scene and night life our union
is far behind the competition; far
too many students spend eve-
nings at Kings or LSE.
I believe the union has the po-
tential to be an amazing venue
and with the incorporation of
Beit Redevelopment I would
like to attract more students as
other London Unions are able to
do by hosting larger club nights
which would be affordable and
desirable.
I would also like to heighten the
profile of the ICU Cinema; as one
of the cheapest cinemas in the
West End I feel it is a shame it is
under used.
I would like to improve catering
within the College; I am keen to
keep the privately run RSM café,
where food is cheaper and tastier
than in equivalent College owned
outlets such as in Da Vinci’s.
As President, representing stu-
dent’s needs I feel it is essential
that I am approachable if stu-
dents feel there is an issue they
need to discuss.

The Union has taken great steps for-
ward this year albeit not without con-
troversy. We have joined the NUS, we
have reformed our governance struc-
ture, we have entered into a Sports
Partnership with the College, we un-
dertook some painful but necessary
reforms to our commercial services.
We can make great things from these
changes but need a President that is
fully aware of the issues and has been
involvedinthemthroughout.VoteJon
Matthews for President and I will:
• Ensure that we get the service we
deserve from the NUS especially the
promised Science and Engineering
Network.
• Negotiate properly with College
to ensure better co-operation without
sacrificing independence.
• Work for a model of postgraduate
representation that works and serves
all postgraduates.
• Ensure an energy efficient and
sustainable redevelopment that con-
tinues to meet student wishes and
requirements.
• Make all Union officers truly ac-
countable and remove the hurdles
that still exist in calling officers to
account.
• Ensure the gym remains truly
free, not charged for by the back door.
• Be available to students when-
ever needed (I already work 100 hour
weeks).
• Continue the work to reduce bar
prices, we have had three cuts this
year but can have more.
• Improve Union catering, let’s face
it, it needs it.
• Bring experience and proven
leadership ability to the Union.
You cannot select a President on
250 words, for more information,
email me at jgm99@imperial.ac.uk
or watch out for me at hustings and
around campus.

As the Slate’s DPCS candidate I
will support the policies of the oth-
er Slate candidates.
These include an office hour for
sabbs to make them more accessi-
ble and the renaming of the posts
of president and deputy president
to Don and Capo, along with re-
naming the council and executive
committee to the Commission and
the Sit Down.
I will try to continue the war on
bureaucracy, as I’m sure every
candidate will promise.
This can be done by allow-
ing more forms to be handed in
electronically.
I will also try and increase the
autonomy of clubs and societies.
For example allowing clubs to
decide for themselves how their
AGM is run, instead of the usual
way written in the constitution
template, or by reducing the newly
elected officers form, by not includ-
ing details about the non-essential
officers.
Money can also be saved by get-
ting clubs to share.
It sounds so easy but if for exam-
ple there are 2 scuba societies why
does each one have to get expen-
sive equipment or why do we have
2 golf societies each paying for
ground hire.
Our membership of the NUS
should be exploited: NUS cam-
paigns like the ‘Strong and Active
Unions’ can provide assistance to
societies.
Finally I will help campus’s other
then South Kensington, get a fair
deal with regards to C&S.
It’s true that my union experi-
ence as re-app and club officer
doesn’t compare with that of my
opponent but with me you are
promised some fresh ideas.

Why should you vote me for
DPCS?
Well I have seen first hand the
problems which clubs and socie-
ties face everyday; this experience
comes from being a club officer, in
a club and society executive com-
mittee, and working in the student
activities centre.
From this I would like to un-com-
plicate the union, so make the eve-
ryday running of all clubs and soci-
eties less frustrating.
The union has to remember it is
here to help clubs and societies not
to hinder them.
This means not freezing budgets
without at least telling the commit-
tee, as I have seen it do, or setting
deadlines which the clubs and soci-
eties only find out about with very
little time to spare.
Many of the countless forms
which plague clubs and societies
could be implemented online with
email confirmation and updated
versions from last year.
Also much of the finance system
could be automated online. This
would be a huge improvement lead-
ing to less paperwork, and the staff
having more time to actually talk
to the very people they are there to
help.
I believe the process in which
clubs and societies go through to
get anything online needs to be
made easier.
Plus the time taken to get any-
thing put online needs to be de-
creased, if only to persuade clubs
and societies it’s a good idea in the
first place!
Remember a vote for me would
be for an approachable friendly
person that clubs and societies
could come to sort out any of their
problems.
