Sabb manifestos
Sabb manifestos
I am supposed to open this mani-
festo detailing the experience I
have.
I’ve been involved at every level
from representing students, be-
ing a member of a sports club and
sometimes I just like using the
bar.
Having now demonstrated my in-
volvement with the Union I could
now proceed to take credit for eve-
rything it has done well, distance
my self from the bad parts and
“gracefully” accept complete re-
sponsibility for things that are go-
ing to happen anyway. I have seen
this happen at election time for the
past four years and I want to make
the Union a bit more sincere and
relevant.
Reporting for Felix on the Un-
ion and what it does for the past 2
years got me thinking about things
that could be done better.
Union politicians need to accept
that most of our members have no
interest sitting on committees, fo-
rums or filling out paperwork so we
need to engage with these people.
Why should they have to turn up
to dull meetings to feel involved?
A full manifesto is available online
but here are the highlights.
Elect me as President for more
student discounts, less Union
spam e-mails and making sure
that the NUS keeps the prom-
ises they made to us during the
referendum.
I would also strive to keep bar
prices as low as is economically
possible and continue lobbying col-
lege over the wild disparities in the
proportion of good degrees award-
ed by different departments.
Vote Stephen Brown for a more
open Union.

President
Weeeey! I’m Diogo (dee-oh-goh!),
a full-time 21 year old Portuguese
macho and a more occasional Bio-
medical Engineer wannabe. You’re
probably now wondering why would
someone like me, whose only Union
experience is having tried all the
types of lager sold in Da Vinci’s, run
for President. Well… I think that
anyone can learn the bureaucratic
crap that you need to run it, but stu-
dent life, my fellow friends, that can’t
be studied in the library! You have to
experience it in order to completely
understand what being a student is
and how to solve our problems and
that I think I master. The following
are some of the things I’m aiming to
change in our college:
bring fun and coolness to the
Union bars by organising more
common events with the med-
ics, Wye and the Royal Colleges
of Art and of Music.
get an outside bar in Beit Quad
for Summer Term chilling and
revamp Db’s properly.
provide hot snacks to the Hol-
land Club for all those PhD
binge drinkers.
try to get reading weeks and
create the Teacher of the Year

award in all the departments,
improving results and lecturing
quality.
give more funds to departmen-
tal societies and organise ca-
reer days within each course in
order to help with professional
decisions.
start workshops and collabo-
rations with the neighbouring
colleges of Art and Music for all
the repressed creative Imperial
students.
More information in my Face-
book group or when you see me half
sober.

I believe that a good Union presi-
dent is the person who best rep-
resents the Imperial College
students.
The president is the elected
spokesperson for the students of
Imperial and responsible for con-
veying the view of Imperial stu-
dents to the rest of the country. I
believe that I am that person.
As a first year I will be bring-
ing fresh blood and new ideas to
ICU. I will still have to complete
my course after being president,
so I care about how the Union will
be run.
Final year students may have
union experience, but may not
care as much for the future of ICU
as a younger candidate as they
are no longer a student, will they
best represent views of students?
I am not going to tell what you
want to hear, or say I will do
things that I know I won’t or can’t
to be president. Instead I will
express things that I think need
changing:
Stella Artois on tap in the union!
Why isn’t the country’s most pop-
ular beer in the union?
Open a union run book shop!
Are we becoming illiterate? With
Waterstone’s gone where will stu-
dents buy their books? (yes some
people actually BUY books)
Have more recycling facilities on
campus! I am no eco-warrior but
do feel we throw away too many
things that could be reused.
I support all ideas expressed
by fellow members of the ‘Slate’
(Messrs. Balikhin, Holland,
Narayanan and myself).
“Youthful enthusiasm and new
ideas vs. experienced old hacks.”
YOU DECIDE!
