GKT get knocked of the park and sent packing
ULU Men’s Hockey
Challenge Cup Quarter Final
IC 1st XI 6
GKT 1st XI 2
With spirits high from the convinc-
ing victory against the medic scum
it was time to kick some more ass!
Having watched an inspiring per-
formance from the Ladies, the Men
were certainly in the right state of
mind for some more medic bash-
ing...this time in the ULU cup in
which IC dominate year in, year
out...
With Batty skiing, Jumanji flying
and the Rat seeing his Desire, it
was chance for Stumpy and Sid to
join in the current goal frenzy that
is IC mens 1s!
KCLMS (GKT) got off to a ropey
start with only 8 players and no
keepers kit. After the umpires
“consulted” their rule book they
decided that it was time to get
this game started, much to the
bemusement of the GKT kev-ball-
ing captain. Fortunately for GKT
the missing medics weren’t long
behind and attempted to warm up.
Wasting no time, Harvester gath-
ered his troops and marched on
into battle.
A tactical decision to change ends
left the opposition floundering, and
with the massive of support of bril-
liant home crowd the IC onslaught
was underway. GKT, having mus-
tered a full team showed that they
were not going to be walked over
and some good individual skill in
midfield took even better tackling
from the IC centre-back partner-
ship of Foetus and Shipman. Good
movement up-front and a lot of
running from the midfield paid div-
“I told you once, I told you twice young man – that stick is not an instrument to rain down furious blows of death upon thine enemy!”
idends for IC as the GKT defence
started to feel the strain. Goals
started to flow and after a couple
of attacking short corners IC were
on top.
MASSIVE JAZZ HANDS
The Bottle Match, A tradition that
dates back to 1902. A day of Sport!
Drinking! And rivalry! A date that
should be marked in every Royal
Miner’s calendar, the 23rd & 24th
February.

The Bottle Match is an annual
event between the RSM and the
Camborne School of Mines (CSM).
The Bottle Match has been tak-
ing place for 105 years making it
the second oldest varsity match in
Britain!
Students from the rival schools
go head to head in rugby (men’s
and women’s), hockey (men’s and
women’s), football, golf and squash.
The rugby match is the clash which
wins the much coveted 3ft Bass-
Charrington beer bottle stolen in
true RSM fashion by students in
1946.
For the last 10 years it has lived
behind the union bar where the
RSM are hoping it will stay by ex-
tending their dominance to over a
decade!
This year the Bottle Match is
taking place at Harlington Sports
Ground on the last Saturday of the
month. Matches start with women’s
hockey at 9am and finish off with
the much anticipated men’s rugby
match at 2pm. On the Friday the
golf and squash will be played. The
players’ dinner is to be held in the
SCR on campus with the after party
being held in the Union Bar and
Da’Vincis. It would be great to see
as many people as possible cheer-
ing on the RSM in this day of truly
passionate rivalry!
