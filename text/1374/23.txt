I Like Mine With a Kiss follows
Louise (an unmarried teacher) and
Annie (a single mother of one), two
30-something women from the East
End who, on the night of Louise’s
39th birthday, realize they are a long
way from ‘having it all’. As the story
unfolds, drama sets in and tension
rises high as Louise falls pregnant
as does Annie again.
The play explores a world of bas-
tard boyfriends, lesbian daughters,
teenage pregnancy, abortion, moth-
erhood, careers and ‘the hill that
primroses supposedly grown on’
contrasted with a council estate.
All six actors were fantastically
well cast and most carried out their
roles with passion and great con-
viction, especially Andrew French
who took the part of Mathieu, Lou-
ise’s ex-boyfriend. The character
of Mathieu was extremely likeable
and together French and Michelle
Butterly (Louise) managed to con-
jure up an amazing chemistry on
stage. Butterly was highly enter-
taining in her portrayal of Louise
especially during her drunken
rants about ‘bastard from now’ and
‘bastard from before’ and injected a
lot of humour with sexual innuen-
dos aplenty.
Annie’s mother Jean (Linda
Broughton) added highly comi-
cal interludes, with her expletives,
which at times became quite heavy
going especially by the end of the
first half. Broughton also brought
in a musical dimension to the play,
singing Cry Me a River.
The play inspired lots of thought
regarding the social issues (moth-
erhood, teenagers, sexuality, abor-
tion) however I did not leave think-
ing the playwright had aimed to put
across some pseudo-intellectual
meaning, and therefore did not dull
my enjoyment.
By the end of the play I was left
stunned at the what the play had
to offer: sensational acting talent,
loveable characters, plenty of dra-
ma to satisfy any soap-lover’s taste,
a myriad of jokes (many crude!) yet
also some thinking points without
drawing from the play’s entertain-
ment factor. I Like Mine With A
Kiss deserves a lot of praise and
recognition.

A cross-dressing epic?
Ramayana
Lyric Theatre
Until March 10th
From £7 (Students)
Almost anyone of Indian origin
knows the story of the Ramayana,
still celebrated today as the festival
of Diwali, and David Farr should be
commended for trying to bring the
tale to a new audience in his retell-
ing of the ancient Hindu epic. The
hero is Rama, a prince banished to
a magical forest with his beautiful
wife Sita and loyal brother Laksh-
man. When Sita is kidnapped by
the demon Ravana and taken to his
kingdom, it is up to her distraught
husband to rescue her from his
enemy’s clutches with the help of
Lakshman, the gods, and an army
of talking monkeys.
This play is a reinterpretation for
the young and diverse crowds at
the Lyric; full of comedy and mod-
ern allusions, it makes for great
entertainment, but waters down
the grandeur of the epic. The cast
is lively, capturing the humour and
mischief of the monkey troupe and
their hero Hanuman, and Vanessa
Ackerman makes a suitably spunky
Sita. But some of the production’s
choices have little more than cu-
riosity value – I couldn’t really see
what was gained by having the vil-
lainous King Ravana played by a
woman, although credit should go
to Eva Magyar for the malign cool-
ness she brings to the role. In fact,
too often Farr gives in to the temp-
tation to make cheap jokes rather
than provoke tension, and it is left
to Shri’s superb music to provide
the drama and atmosphere that are
lacking in the script.
Despite closely following the plot
of the original, the production’s
themes of materialism and greed
versus spiritualism and truth feel
as if they were bolted on to the
story, and ring hollow as a conse-
quence. Besides its fantastical ele-
ment – monkey kings, ten-headed
monsters, herbs that bring people
back to life – the Ramayana is a
sophisticated study of humanity,
where love is not always happy ever
after, and even heroes are prone to
envy and self-doubt. I think that an
interpretation that drew out these
very modern themes would reso-
nate better with our times than any
amount of cross-dressing. This
Ramayana is certainly enjoyable,
but it longs for the depth and emo-
tion to do true justice to an ancient
story.

Chamber Concert
The concert comprised a selection
of performances ranging from ro-
mantic violins sonatas to themed
improvisations using saxophones, a
variety of percussion and feed-back
from amps.
The concert kicked off with three
military marches, followed by some
lovely violin playing from Anne-
Marie Magnan and an exciting
improvisation from Contemporary
Music Society. The group used a
wide variety of extremely interest-
ing looking percussion instruments
including a rain-stick and some
rattles covered in shells as well as
more traditional instruments to
create an intriguing sound-world.
Later there was a virtuosic per-
formance of Poulenc’s Clarinet So-
nata by Stephaine Ramboarina and
Delphine Feuerstein. The Sonata is
a darkly beautiful work which ex-
ploits both instruments to create an
exquisite palette of sound and was
peformed with aplomb.
The final item was the first move-
ment of a piano quintet by Edward
Elgar. Lead by Lukas Medlam with
pianist Shuang Wang, they provided
an exciting and impressive ending
to a thoroughly excellent evening.
Busking
You can miss a concert, you can
avoid artwork, but it’s hard to ig-
nore it when two people are spin-
ning and kicking in front of you on
the way to the JCR.
Clad in sexy black-and-yellow and
sporting posters, flyers and collect-
ing tins, the musicians, dancers and
martial artists in ArtsFest busking
brought a bit of culture to even the
most philistine of scientists.
Acts ranged from individuals to
societies, including Contemporary
Music, Gospel Choir, and MTSoc.
The martial arts society Capoeira
attracted a huge amount of atten-
tion as they performed on the walk-
way in front of the SCR (security
later spoiled the show). Gypsy jazz
came to the SCR in the form of the
Victoria Watson Trio, and acoustic
pop was provided in the Tanaka
Foyer by David Paw and friends.
Special mention should go to the
Hilary Woods Quartet, who played
beautifully, and to tenor Ed Hughes
and pianist Gamal Khamis, who
performed in a range of venues on
different days. They also took part
with other singers in an informal
version of Purcell’s Dido and Ae-
neas. Yes, an entire opera.
Jazz and Rock Night
On Tuesday evening the action
moved to dB’s, with and Open Mic
night organised by the Jazz and
Rock Society. These sorts of nights
lend themselves well to the “guy/
girl with guitar” singer-songwriter
style, and this was no exception.
The beginning of the evening was
dominated by a series of acoustic
singers, playing a range of covers
and own material. Special mention
should go to Pete MacRae and Nick
Round, whose addition of a violin
was an interesting change, and the
bloke whose name I unfortunately
missed, but who deserves much ku-
dos for playing Tenacious D.
The acoustic mood was then left
far behind as the bands took to the
stage. Although I admit death met-
al is not to my taste, Death Penalty
were energetic and enthusiastic,
and seemed to be enjoying them-
selves immensely. The final act was
the fantastic Circus Penguin, whose
interesting punk-rock-jazz stylings
and good musicianship was a great
end to an entertaining night.
The Finale
This year’s ArtsFest culminated in
a feast of music, dance and mar-
tial arts at the Finale concert last
Friday.
As I sat in my seat waiting I was
distracted by the hilarious double
act of comperes Billy Feenan and
Katie Heskins. The concert opened
a grand collaboration between Sin-
fonietta, IC and ICSM choirs per-
forming an excerpt from The Mas-
tersingers by Wagner.
Windband chose a challenging
set for their ArtsFest debut. This
was followed by the music-influ-
enced, Brazilian martial art Capoe-
ira. Their spontaneous, acrobatic
play fighting was set to traditional
instruments.
ICSE provided us with a stunning
rendition of Barber’s impassioned
Adagio for Strings which provoked
a tear in the eye and possibly the
most enthusiastic applause of the
night. The second ArtsFest debu-
tants, FuNkoLoGy, gave us a highly
polished medley of urban styles
based on a ‘Heroes – good vs. Evil’
theme. Not to be upstaged, three
teams from Dance Company com-
bined ballet, contemporary, jazz,
and tap styles in one outrageous
fusion.
BigBand rounded up the evening
and, as always, certainly did not fail
to rouse the audience. Particularly
impressive was Jan Marchant on
trumpet whose soaring top notes
were the icing on a very tasty Big-
Band cake.
Not bad for a bunch of scientists,
engineers & medics. Not only that
but around £400 was raised for the
Newman Trust too. Culture without
the petri dish indeed…
