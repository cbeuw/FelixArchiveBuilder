etters to the Editor
L
A nice easy
starter for ten
A collection of random missives
Dear Felix,
After looking out my office window,
and seeing a rather large crane
moving over the Sherfield building,
I started wondering what all this
building work going on at Imperial
was. Like what is the deal with that
door to nowhere they put in the side
of the Library? It would be great if
you could let us all know in Felix!

Andy Sykes replies,
The large crane is probably for fill-
ing in the lightwells that occupy
space on level 4 of the Sherfield
Building. Plans are afoot to in-
crease the office space up there,
and I think the Finance Depart-
ment have been moved across the
road to Princes Gate.
I have often wondered what the
hell the ‘door to the beyond’ was
in the side of the library. After
close consultation with Mr Ash-
ley Brown (Live! editor) we have
decided that this door was for
workmen so they didn’t have the
traipse through the library to get
to the floor where work was being
done. There was a staircase made
of scaffolding up to it at one point.
I just hope that should a confused
student who happens to be drunk
on excessive revising doesn’t mis-
take it for an exit and fall thirty
feet to the concrete.
The library is getting a new ven-
tilation system (to combat the in-
tense local warming in level 4 and
5) and a general refurbishment.
At least, that was the plan, but
you’ll see from the front page that
this redevelopment has been thor-
oughly shafted by Westminster
Council.
Still upset about
the reply to Sam
Furse
Dear Andy,
Hate to stop you doing your job with
having to deal with minor pedants,
but I’m writing regarding the Felix
page 3 reply to Sam Furse this week.
You are quoted as writing that ‘You
are not 6’4”, tanned and incredibly
muscular’ about Mr Furse.
Well as it so happens, he can prob-
ably top those requirements of the
physical parameters; he’s 6’6” and
he’s rather strong (just you try sit-
ting on a horse’s back for atleast an
hour a week whilst trying to make
it do tricks and trying not to fall off
-you probably won’t be able to walk
the next day).
OK, he’s no Arnie, but you did try
to give an example of what param-
eters qualify as Adonis. Yes his and
Kat Gray’s page 3 may not have
been to everyone’s taste, and I for
one did not exactly find it some-
thing to stick on my wall, but it got
more people talking than the regu-
lar stock of averagely pretty girls
in underwear (which admitedly
probably got more geeks w**king)
which is the point of the Felix page
3, is it not?
I just thought you ought to get
your facts right before trying to in-
sult him back.
Another thing is - I know you’re
trying to cater Felix to it’s ‘target
reader group’ with this great surge
of soft-porn and all (congratula-
tions on actually getting a semi-na-
ked bloke this week), but honestly,
are the four pages of ‘games’ really
necessary? Most of the pictures
could be reduced in size and you
could probably reduce the section
down to about two pages.
Finally, I wonder why you made
‘Collins in X-factor’ a headline story
when the fool who filled in the ap-
plication form couldn’t even follow
the instructions (namely ‘PLEASE
COMPLETE YOUR APPLICA-
TION IN BLOCK CAPITALS’). Per-
haps you should run a story in the
vein of ‘Collins can’t follow instruc-
tions horror’ next week?
On positive note, Felix this year
has been a bit better designed and
laid out, and whoever writes the
horoscopes is a comedy genius, so
well done on that.

Andy Sykes replies,
For the last time, I wasn’t trying
to insult Mr Furse. I’m hardly one
to talk – I’m 5’ 10”, pasty and have
been compared to Skeletor in terms
of build.
I shouldn’t have used that phrase,
as it seems to have been readily
misinterpreted. I’ve apologised to
Mr Furse, and I hope there are no
hard feelings between us. Oh, and
I saw him in the Union the other
day, and he is f-ing massive. My
mistake.
I think you’re right about Page 3.
There was a nicely chiselled bloke
on this week’s, which seemed to
please a few ladies. There’s a great
one for next week, but I won’t spoil
it (it’s more in keeping with the old
Page 3 style).
As for games, a bunch of people
have approached me and said it’s
the only thing they read, and a few
people have said they hate it. There
are a lot of gameplayers in College,
and they seem to be enjoying it.
It only suffers in comparison
with the other sections; seeing as
a few members of Felix are on the
campaign trail, and a few have
had tragic things happen to them,
the arty sections are a bit light.
Hopefully things should improve in
the next week or so. The best part
about Felix was never the news,
but the back part of the paper.
I won’t name who filled in the ap-
plication form for fear of making
them look bad at an inopportune
time.
Anorexia -
Mis-represented
and inaccurate
Sir,
Your “fashion” editorial Anorexia: a
media problem? made unsubstanti-
ated claims about this serious dis-
order. This poorly edited piece sen-
sationalized anorexia nervosa and
misrepresented the contributing
roles of the media and the family in
its development.
Your author claimed that “Ano-
rexia and obesity are the health
problems currently garnering the
most attention,” yet she did not
present evidence that this is the
case. Anecdotally, the “size zero”
debate and popular weight-loss di-
ets both loom large in media aimed
at women, but other disorders are
also the focus of newspapers and
journalism - fertility issues and can-
cer and its detection and treatment
as other conditions spring to mind
as reported about on an ongoing
basis; concerns surrounding the
detection of the H5N1 virus have
received numerous column inches
of late.
Ms Skeete’s interpretation of the
incidence of Eating Disorders and
body dissatisfaction in Fiji, and her
pointing to the arrival of television
as a causal factor, is facile. If two
factors change simultaneously this
does not imply a causal relation-
ship. It is probable that the arrival
of television in Fiji coincided with
other lifestyle changes, any or all of
which could have contributed to the
reported increase in Eating Disor-
der symptoms and body dissatisfac-
tion among young Fiji women.
Giselle’s allegation that “The
parents are responsible, not fash-
ion” should be presented together
with contrasting evidence that sug-
gests that “bad parenting” does not
“cause” anorexia. To agree that
this is the case perpetuates the
myth that anorexia nervosa is a dis-
ease caused by the family,and does
nothing to alleviate the guilt that a
sufferer’s loved ones may feel when
they watch helplessly if the disease
takes hold. In some cases, patholo-
gies within the family contribute
to the development of and mainte-
nance of an eating disorder. Howev-
er, current evidence suggests that
there are many contributory factors
that are involved and interrelated.
Anorexia is not “just a disease,”
it is a disease - a disorder - a set
of symptoms with a diagnosis and
whilst treatment is complex there
are treatments and prognoses. It
is not “a symptom of wider mental
health problems” - it is a mental
health problem.
Recovery from anorexia nervosa,
obesity or body dissatisfaction, in-
volves the maintenance of healthy
body and mind. This is not easy and
requires effort. Attempts to move
towards improved health for all
young women is not aided by un-
realistic body types on the catwalk.
Nor is it aided by misrepresenta-
tion of serious mental health issues
in Felix.

replies,
I think health is a serious issue
with respect to fashion, and at the
time of writing, the size zero issue
featured prominently in newspa-
pers, which is more relevant to
a Fashion page than say fertility
treatments or cancer. What I wrote
reflected my opinion and personal
experience, which is to say that I
think family plays a part in ano-
rexia in some cases.
I agree that anorexia nervosa,
obesity and other eating disor-
ders are serious diseases. I know
anorexia takes serious effort to
overcome. Having more realistic
body shapes on the catwalk might
help in some cases. However as I
mentioned in my article, there are
many reasons why this isn’t go-
ing to change drastically anytime
soon. Calling for bigger sizes on
the catwalk is well and good, but as
you said, anorexia is a multi-fac-
eted disorder. As I drew attention
to, the government focusing on
healthy eating, and teaching nutri-
tion at schools, is a realistic way to
help target eating disorders.
I’m sorry if you feel I “sensation-
alised” anorexia, I wrote from my
experience and brought up some
points that are often lost in an at-
tempt to not offend anyone.
The incredible door that leads to absolutely nowhere. What the hell is it for?
