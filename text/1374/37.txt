Half past nine is far too early to
meet at the union on a Sunday
morning, but IC Ladies 1st Hockey
Team are all dedicated athletes, so
at the crack of dawn last Sunday
they headed off to Fortress Har-
lington, along with a healthy con-
tingent from the rest of Imperial

playing.
(Most were a bit worse for the
wear from the previous night’s she-
nanigans at a certain West London
pub.)
IC went in feeling confident – de-
spite some disappointing results,
form is improving, and as the ULU
Cup defending champions, they
were definitely the stronger side
going in.
This became obvious in the first
10 minutes, with two quick goals,
destroying LSE’s confidence.
The rest of the first half was fairly
quiet until disaster struck and LSE

So after only a few hours sleep as
the pre-match early bedtime had
been violated by being in the Goose
til closing, 11 valiant ladies made it
to Harlington in the freezing cold.
For once our coach bothered com-
ing to a match and even made us
warm up properly, with drills and
such like! The game got off to a fan-
tastic start with IC playing some
of the best hockey of the season,
clearly the position rearrangement
put to Fi by Dasha and Alice was
paying off with Bella and Melissa
fitting into their new roles on the
wing brilliantly with Mala in the
middle.
There were numerous IC shots
on goal, with Amanda and Dasha
having chances but it took about
20 minutes before Melissa scored
the opener from a well struck ball
from Bella. St Georges picked up
the pace and made the defence had
to work hard, I don’t think Fi has
done so much running all season.
However it all went a bit wrong on a
long corner and St Georges scored
an equaliser just before half time.
The half time talk was inspiration-
al from Shiv, but the St Georges one
must have been better as they came
out with a vengeance. Something in
the IC tactics had gone wrong with
people all out of position, however
the defence were great in the at-
tempts to stop the opposition. Alice
did some fantastic defending on the
left and Sheena was great in the
middle coping with their best play-
er. However no matter how much
shouting from the sweeper/goalie/
coach mattered as St Georges got a
break and scored another.
The last 10 minutes were once
again great hockey from IC as play
was being so well switched across
the back to Ellie and up the right
to Bella and Dasha who had more
than their fair share of the play.
No matter how hard IC tried they
just couldn’t score that equaliser
and so the final whistle went with
IC being defeated and not making
it to the final for the first time in
years.
managed to equalise, taking advan-
tage of a dismal five minutes by IC,
and of Kebab’s first goal – in the
wrong end of the pitch!
Definitely some fineage for that
on Wednesday.
Luckily IC struck it lucky and
scored from a penalty corner at
a strategic point – just before half
time.
Captain Moony’s motivational
talk did its trick at half time, and
IC went in to the second half full of
energy. LSE never looked like scor-
ing again, and IC finished off by de-
stroying them – 6-2, including a hat-
trick by Moony. Well played!

IC Women’s Hockey – some stay in, some go out
This was a home game for us,
but as all 3 boys teams were also
playing at home, we played at the
Medic’s ground in Teddington. The
ref society refused to appoint us a
referee on the basis that Middlesex
had only turned up with 10 players
the week before. This turned out
to be the case again, but due to so
many injuries in our squad at the
moment, we were also only capable
of fielding 10 players.
So it worked out well in the end,
meaning that neither team had
to concede and we played for the
points. Our coach, John Sykes,
agreed to referee for us, had it not
been for him we would have been
lacking a rather important element
of the game! 10-a-side and uncon-
tested scrums meant that we put
the very tiny winger Cheryl in as
second row, allowing us a speedy
pack of forwards.
The match went well for us
– Courtney scored 5 of our 6 tries,
each time by breaking through Mid-
dlesex’s line of defence and touch-
ing down under the posts, and Rox-
anne served us well by converting
every try scored, bumping up the
scores. Olga scored her virgin try
for the team, following an off-load
from Courtney, leading to yet an-
other try between the posts. No-
table moments during the match
were when Middlesex attempted to
score a drop goal, and thought they
were successful, only to be remind-
ed by the ref that a drop-goal has to
be a drop-kick, not a punt!
Middlesex were very fowl-
mouthed and swore at the ref a
number of times – apparently
nearly every player they had on the
pitch was a qualified ref and ‘they
know all the rules’ which quite
clearly was not the case, especially
shown by their attempt at a ‘drop’
goal! The Virgins played very well
in this match and were very good at
supporting each other to allow the
game to flow quite smoothly, how-
ever we need to work on our ball-
handling skills after the number
of knock-on’s in the game!! Well
played by everyone, and special
welcome to Megan who played with
us for the first time this season.

Well an interesting and somewhat
different game this certainly was! I
myself was very much looking for-
ward to this day, after being given
the all-clear by doctors to play again
following hand surgery back in De-
cember. UCL remain unbeaten in
BUSA and unfortunately, try as we
might, we were unable to change
this. The game started off well,
with both sides looking relatively
well-matched.
Within the first 20 minutes, 3 tries
had been scored, 2 for UCL and 1 for
us. No conversions left the score at
10-5 and gave the Virgins hope that
maybe this could be pulled out of
the hat. As the whistle blew for
half time, the score was 22-5 but
all was by no means lost. The sec-
ond half of the game started with
our kick, and we hit back at them
hard. Within 5 minutes however,
full back Jess was on the ground in
pain, complaining of neck/ shoulder
pain. The medics of the team took
charge (Serena and Bonnie in par-
ticular) and decided not to take any
chances with pain in this area and
called for an ambulance.
It took half an hour for the para-
medics to sort Jess out and take
her off to hospital, which left both
teams starting to cool off and anx-
ious to finish the game. At the whis-
tle to re-start, the Virgins had lost
spirit and found it very difficult to
get back into the game. This lead
to a succession of tries being run in
by UCL, with a series of successful
conversions.
I have to say how well we man-
aged to pull it back together and en-
joy the last 10 minutes of the game
to finish on a high, knowing we had
fought back after everything that
had happened.
Two more players spent the
evening in A&E: myself, after re-
breaking my finger, and Lucy with
a potential concussion. However,
all players are on the mend with no
serious outcomes. All in all not the
best of games but experience none
the less!
