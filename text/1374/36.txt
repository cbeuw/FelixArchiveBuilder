Debating society made its first for-
ay into foreign lands on the first of
this month, as it boarded a Luton
easyJet flight to Bremen, Germany.
We sent two teams (A: Till Stenzel
& Edmund Hunt, B: Aneurin Young
& Adrienne De Souza) and one
judge (Hannah Gray) to the debat-
ing tournament of International
University Bremen, IUB Open 2007.
I happily hasten to add that the
whole tournament was conducted
in English, as are most modern Eu-
ropean competitions. I don’t think
my GCSE German would have been
up to much, alas.
As fortune would have it, my
team mate Till was actually from
Bremen. Therefore, when we ar-
rived we were picked up from the
airport by his ever-helpful mother,
to spend the first night at his house.
In the morning we had a quick tour
around the beautiful old city, host
of much history. As we would do
for the whole tour, we ate generous
amounts of fortifying German food,
before arriving at the IUB around
5pm for registration. The IUB is a
rare thing in Germany (Europe, in-
deed): a privately built and funded
university. There was thus a char-
acteristic free-spirited attitude
from the competition’s organisers
and students. As it happened, the
Open’s tagline was ‘Total Debauch-
ery: Reloaded’. This promise would
become increasingly fulfilled as the
rounds progressed.
As is usual at IVs, we waited an
inordinate amount of time as late-
comers arrived and the hapless
tech-support chap fiddled with the
uncooperative PowerPoint technol-
ogy. But eventually the first motion
was announced (THW Privatise
All Universities) and we sprang
into action. I should add at this
point that IVs are utterly exhaust-
ing. This is because they consist of
protracted periods of stressful wait-
ing between rounds, heightened
anticipation as the next motion is
announced, frantic brainstorming
and discussion with your partner
during the 15 minutes prep time be-
fore the debate, and a solid hour of
intense, rapidly shifting arguments
in the debate itself. This was all
the more heightened as speeches
were to be seven minutes of length,
rather than the usual five you find
in other IVs. After a slightly weak
win in the first round, me and Till
went on trounce our opponents in
the second, debating a classic mo-
tion in the legalisation of bestiality.
This despite the fact that, due to a
late start, we were debating until
about 1230 at night. Imperial B had
a first and a second, so at the end
of the first night we were all in high
spirits. As promised, we went on to
the IUB student bar for free beer:
Becks is brewed in Bremen, so we
were drinking its various forms for
the duration. Taking the coward’s
way out – an early night – we left
at 2am to wander over to the youth
hostel room we had been given near
the university.
In the morning we were (helpful-
ly?) encouraged out of bed at 745am
by the rather insistent Germanic
tones of a volunteer. After a curious
breakfast of salami and strawberry
jam the bleary-eyed contestants as-
sembled in the main meeting room.
Imperial A came across a non-start-
er in trying to propose a motion lim-
iting the number of foreign players
in domestic club football. We came
fourth. Somewhat dejected, we
steeled ourselves for the final two
rounds. These were ‘closed adju-
dication’, so we were not to be told
their outcome until the final ‘break’
of those teams with enough points
to reach the semi-finals was an-
nounced in the evening. But goaded
into passion our analysis and rheto-
ric reached new heights in motions
about NATO intervention in the Su-
dan and preventing the developing
world from using nuclear power.
Amusingly, Imperial A met B in
that final round, and the outcome
was left temporarily ambiguous.
Treated to a novel pancake dinner
aboard an old sailing ship docked in
one of Bremen’s rivers, we then ar-
rived at the big Saturday night party.
Perhaps it was just nervous antici-
pation of the break announcement,
but it was one of the best parties I’d
been to for a long time. Those Ger-
mans certainly know their techno-
cheese. With whoops of delight
from Imperial A, we learnt at 1am
that we’d broken fourth out of 50
teams, comfortably into the semi-
finals. Hannah too ‘broke’ as one of
the semi-final judges, impressing
the convenor with her thoughtful
decisions. Sensibly chickening out
of contention for the ‘last man at
the bar award’, we left to catch an-
other six hours’ sleep.
Now things became a little more
serious. The semis and final were
open to a public audience, and so
when, at 11am the Sunday morn-
ing, the semi-final motion was an-
nounced, the stakes were higher.
Fortune smiled upon Imperial A
however, and we were second prop
for a motion legalising holocaust
denial (in Germany and much of
Debauchery and debate in Bremen
Europe that is still very much a
crime). Till knew this topic well,
and I devised an interesting angle
about the role of martyrdom in fas-
cist ideology, so we put in a solid
performance. Later on that day all
the competitors made their way to
the downtown Bremen concert hall,
‘Die Glocke’, for the final. We were
confident that we’d done well, and
sure enough, when the final break
was announced, Imperial A was
called up to the front of the impos-
ing hall. As in the semis, we picked
the position we were to argue out of
a hat. With a rather grim look on his
face, Till drew out first proposition,
and we were to be at the whim of
the motion: I confess that generally,
it is easier to oppose an idea than
argue its case. Sent outside of the
packed hall into the foyer, we were
handed the motion on a folded piece
of paper. “THW Put the Children of
Long Term Unemployed Parents
up for Adoption”. Oh dear. In a trun-
cated 15 minutes prep time (we’d
been promised 25), we did our best
to dream up reasons why this was
a good idea. Called into the hall,
up onto a spot-lit stage, Till gave
it his best shot, and I followed up
with a plea to ‘unplug children from
these failing social networks’. Un-
derstandably however, the public
audience wasn’t terribly sympa-
thetic, giving warm applause to an
opposition speaker who likened it
to ethnic cleansing (yawn!). Still, I
felt we’d done a decent job with a
difficult motion. However, the win,
when announced, went to first op-
position. They’d done well in previ-
ous rounds, and I suspect the judg-
es felt they deserved it for a good
overall performance.
But there you have it: we still
made it to the final, which was a
first-time for both me and Till (and
Imperial itself, perhaps?) Nothing
can compare to the experience of
debating in front of a diverse public
audience: it really is elating. On my
protracted journey back to NW10, I
felt pleased that we’d positively put
Imperial’s name into the public eye.
Well done, ICU debating: here’s
hoping for many more successes to
come.
Ed and Till prepare for 1st Round
London International Model Unit-
ed Nations (LIMUN) arrived on
Friday. For the second year run-
ning, the event in which students
from universities all over the world
gather to debate significant inter-
national issues, was held at Impe-
rial College.
The hoard of eager students de-
scended on the opening ceremony
on the afternoon of February 16th,
held in the historic surroundings of
Westminster Central Hall; venue for
the first-ever conference in 1946.
After introductions by King’s
College organisers Ryan Soo and
Jehan Karim amidst delayed ap-
plause, Sir Kieran Prendergast
took to the stage, delivering the
keynote speech. He spoke with the
usual admiration for people under
thirty years old taking interest in
the United Nations, and made some
poignant insights into the conflict
in Iraq, the issue over which the es-
teemed ambassador resigned from
civil service in 2005.
Nine committees of the UN were
simulated over the three day mara-
thon that totalled fifteen-and-a-half
hours of debate, discussion and
lobbying on topics ranging from hu-
man trafficking, to water politics, to
the prosecution of Jospeh Kony, to
the situation in Israel and Palestine.
The security council was subjected
to a fictional crisis in Lebanon, in
which the militant Islamic group
Hezbollah staged a coup. Soon
enough, Israel was launching ‘sur-
gical strikes’ on suspected Iranian
nuclear sites in retaliation to the
shooting down of their foreign min-
ister’s plane.
Luckily enough, the situation was
defused when a consensus was
reached to disarm Israel and call
for a ceasefire across the whole
Middle East region.
Saturday night’s social event
aboard the HMS Belfast, moored
near Tower Bridge, was a welcome
respite from all the imaginary vio-
lence and disasters sprouting up
during the weekend, and was the
scene of intercultural dancing and
binge drinking. ‘Is this the way to
Amarillo’ translated well into the
variety of languages and nationali-
ties in the mingle, and friendships
were sealed after participants ex-
changed facebook IDs.
Many volunteers from Imperial
College took part in the organising
of LIMUN 2007. ICMUN’s Michael
Such and Sheena Shah formed
part of the secretariat, whilst Terry
Wong, Xiaoyun Lee, Livia Lai, Mus-
tafa, Dincer and numerous others
provided technical support, guid-
ance to the college and administra-
tive aid in the form of printing lots.
Imperial’s Model UN has meet-
ings most Mondays, and presents
a friendly atmosphere in which to
learn more about how the interna-
tional community functions, and a
proactive environment in which to
practise oratory skills.
