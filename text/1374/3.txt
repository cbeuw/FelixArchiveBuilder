Sabb hustings
descend into
complete farce
A. Hack
Our Man with a Pint
Felix wishes to apologise for ever
suggesting that this year’s sabbati-
cal elections could be anything but
a farce (or at least, the hustings).
The first hustings took place on
Monday evening after Union Coun-
cil, the idea being that candidates
would face a “Question Time” grill-
ing courtesy of the hacks present.
Free food and drink (alcoholic and
otherwise) were provided in order
to lure the “average” student in.
The hope was that this would enli-
ven hustings, which are normally a
rather pedestrian affair.
Hustings have in the past been
held in the JCR at lunchtime, which
tends to frustrate students who are
trying to eat lunch in peace in be-
tween lectures and labs. They have
also been held in Da Vinci’s bar,
but these have proved even more
irritating to the average student,
many of whom are merely there for
a pint and don’t wish to be yelled at
by a candidate with a microphone.
Hustings at the Reynold’s Bar at
Charing Cross Hospital have seen
attendences of precisely zero, and
were in fact cancelled this year for
that very reason.
Adopting a more informal ap-
proach was supposed to provide a
more entertaining hustings. John
Collins, the Returning Officer, al-
lowed questions from the floor, and
even permitted a great deal of the
less serious questions.
However, in practice the hustings
quickly became a complete joke.
The candidates were drowned out
by heckling, and it quickly became
clear that the only way to get the
crowd’s appreciation was to an-
swer every question in the most
stupid fashion possible. The crowd
(who were mostly drunk on the
free drink provided) jeered at any
candidate that dared to give a seri-
ous answer. John Collins did little
to keep control of the proceedings,
and has been accused by some of
being drunk; he told Felix he wasn’t
drunk, but was merely “tipsy”.
One candidate, Felix Sinclair
(standing for Felix Editor), used his
minute-long allowance for a speech
to attempt to breakdance (poorly),
and threw insults at the other can-
didates. Another candidate, Diogo
Geraldes (standing for President)
constantly spoke out of turn by
grabbing the microphone from Mr
Collins and the other candidates.
His comments became increasing-
ly more offensive, until someone in
the crowd accused him of misogyny,
prompting him to stand up and de-
clare: “Yes, I am a misogynist!”
The debacle left a sour taste in
the mouths of many present; a
number of hacks approached Felix
afterwards to express their dissat-
isfaction, one going as far as to call
it “a complete fucking farce”. Many
complained they could gain abso-
lutely no information about the can-
didates whatsoever, and that the
candidates were denied a fair and
unbiased hearing. RCC Chair Mark
Flower (a member of the Elections
Committee) did his best to maintain
order, but it was not to be.
Other candidates for President are
Stephen Brown, Julian Gianuzzi, Jon
Matthews and Sophie Spillard. Other
candidates for Felix Editor are Emily
Lines and Tom Roberts.

Contractors ‘pour concrete down the drains’
ArtsFest’s finale party last Friday
had to be cut short by more than an
hour after damage to the Union’s
drains put all the male toilets in the
building out of service.
Attendees of the event have told
Felix that raw sewage was coming
back into the toilet bowls.
Indications that something was
amiss with the Union’s somewhat
ancient drains had been seen
throughout the week; toilets had
been slow to drain while flush-
ing, and in several cases have
overflowed.
It seems that with the large
number of people in the building on
Friday evening, the drains could no
longer handle the volume of water
RSM fight to save
favourite cafe
The RSM Union has launched a
campaign to save their building cafe
from otherwise certain closure.
Claud’s Cafe, as it is known, is
privately run, and is situated in the
Royal School of Mines building. It
has grown to be loved by staff and
students within the building due to
its low prices (far lower than the
mostly overpriced College catering)
and friendly, individual service.
Claud’s was due to close last
May when the Bessemer Building
and the Mines building were refur-
bished; lobbying by the RSM and a
change in the refurbishment plans
allowed it to remain.
However, Claud’s is once again
in College’s sights. It seems plans
are afoot to replace the cheap and
friendly cafe with a College-run
catering outlet, along with typical
overpriced College food and drink.
Residents of the buildign are un-
derstandbly upset at the loss of 35p
tea, something almost unknown on
campus.
A petition was launched by the
RSM President, Seb Turner, and
has already collected more than 450
signatures, just shy of the 500 Mr
Turner wants to be able to present
to the College.
The RSM have also motivated
staff within the building to join
forces to save Claud’s. Mr Turner
said: “Staff are strongly backing it
as well, and providing very useful
advice. I just hope that the impact
this has had will convince the col-
lege administration to seriously re-
consider their plans.”
and began backing up. Though the
female toilets were still functional,
students had to be asked to leave.
The finger of blame appears to be
pointing at the Union’s contractors
working on the building redevelop-
ment, who have been pouring wet
cement into the drainage system.
College’s contractors, AMEC, have
surveyed the drains and seen evi-
dence of this, though investigations
by the Union’s contractors have yet
to reveal any hardened blockages.
The priority for the moment is to
restore the drains to working order.
Vans have been spotted bringing in
drain rodding gear, and it appears
that the problem will be resolved
next week. “‘Ere, they’re full o’ concrete!”
The RCSU have finally unveiled
the location of the finale of the Sci-
ence Challenge. Combined with a
party to celebrate the first anniver-
sary of the re-launch of the RCSU,
the prize giving will take place in
the Ritz Hotel on March 9th. With
several of the high-profile judges
attending, as well as the cream of
the ICU, the event is likely to be one
of the highest profile events in the
Centenary Year calendar. It’s cer-
tainly the most exciting venue this
reporter can remember an Impe-
rial event being held in.
The Science Challenge competi-
tion has received a huge amount of
media attention, and the BBC, the
Guardian and the Telegraph, as well
as Felix will be covering the event,
and the winner will certainly be re-
ceiving a lot of coverage (as well as
£2500 and a laptop!). If you haven’t
submitted your Science Challenge
essay you’re leaving it a bit late, as
the deadline is 5pm today.
You can buy tickets from the
RCSU website (www.rcsu.org.uk)
