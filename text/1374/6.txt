Sabb
Elections
2007
What are the main issues this year?
Andy Sykes
There’s an interesting mix of candi-
dates this year. On the one hand, we
have a lot of experienced, Union-
savvy folk who know how the place
works (and presumably, how it
doesn’t work). These are what most
would term the “hack” candidates.
On the other hand, there are a
number of candidates who’ve nev-
er been involved with the Union
before, and some who haven’t ex-
pressed any interest in it until now.
These are the “fresh” candidates.
There are pros and cons to both
groups. Hacks may be too wrapped
up the in “papershuffling” aspect
of the sabb jobs to figure out what
will make a difference to your aver-
age apathetic student. On the other
hand, they have the experience to
drop straight into the job.
Fresh-faced types might find the
learning curve incredibly steep
on entering the job, and therefore
achieve absolutely nothing. Howev-
er, they’re likely to be more in touch
with what’s going on in the general
student population.
All of these foolish individuals
who’ve decided to stand will have
a number of problems to face if
they’re elected. These are long-
term issues with the Union that
won’t be resolved by the end of this
year.
Beit Redevelopment
The biggie. The sabbs will have to
keep a constant eye on this and its
ever-shifting deadlines.
NUS membership
Great, we’re in. Now what the hell
do we do with it?
The Charities Bill
Dull to the average student; basi-
cally, the sabbs have to figure out
how the Union can stay independ-
ent without making the themselves
overly personally liable.
Union reform
The perennial problem – what do
we do to make the Union more ef-
ficient and better organised?
What do the sabbaticals do?
Felix explains why you should take a moment to vote for them
If you’re not a hack (and let’s face
it, most of us aren’t hacks) you’re
probably wondering why the hell
you should even bother taking a
few minutes to log in to the Union
voting site and click a few buttons.
“Sabbs?” I hear you cry; “they don’t
do anything except sit on their ars-
es and get paid for the privilege!”
Okay, in some respects you might
be correct, but sabbs actually have
a great deal of power. Don’t forget
that the full-time staff that work for
the Union are often instructed what
to work on by the sabbs. Sabbs even
have the power to change College
policy (well, in theory, anyway).
President
The head honcho. He or she is the
boss of all the Deputy Presidents,
and is pretty much the figurehead
of the Union.
In practical terms, this means
they spend a great deal of time in
meetings, trying to thrash out pol-
icy between all the interested fac-
tions. Any time College does some-
thing the Union doesn’t like, the
President will have to take control
and try and sort it out.
The character of a President will
almost always set the character of
the Union the year. You get what
you vote for.
Deputy President (Finance &
Services)
Probably the most important DP
position, since they hold the purse
strings for almost every activity the
Union dabbles in.
They are responsible for all the
club budgets, events budgets, and
pretty much anything involving
money you care to name.
They are also responsible for the
bars, including pricing, and general
bar strategy. Expect to see lots of
manifestos promising lower bar
prices; pretty much every DPFS
has promised this.
Deputy President (Clubs &
Societies)
If you’re in a club (and statistically
speaking, it’s likely that you are),
then this is your man or woman.
This sabb is responsible for the
day-to-day administration of clubs,
including various wrist-slapping
activities. They also tend to be the
lead organiser for Freshers’ Fair.
With more than 200 clubs, this is
a big responsibility. A lazy or bad
DPCS can spell disaster.
Deputy President (Education &
Welfare)
Traditionally known as the “fluffy”
sabb, a nomenclature that’s only
been reinforced by the occupation
of this role by the exceptionally
fluffy Ben Harris this year.
This sabb spends the vast major-
ity of time in meetings with College,
including the big ones like Senate
(deals with course problems). The
rest of their time is spent on case-
work: dealing with the problems of
individual students.
Deputy President (Graduate
Students)
The more observant among you
might have noticed that there is no
election for this position this year.
That’s because of the furore sur-
rounding the role; no-one in the Un-
ion seems sure whether it is tene-
able in the long run, as the last two
occupants have faced what could be
called intense media scrutiny.
Felix Editor
The odd one out. It’s not like the
other sabbs – the President can’t
order the Editor around.
The Felix Editor is (gasp!) re-
sponsible for producing Felix. At
the moment, it’s one of the only two
student newspapers in London with
a sabb editor.
The Felix Editor is also respon-
sible for producing the Freshers’
Handbook during the summer. If you don’t vote, you can’t complain. It’s the law, y’see
The next group of sabbaticals will have to face a number of difficulties. Felix tells you what they are
The Union. Beautiful in summer, isn’t it?
