A Brit Awards bonanaza
This week we delve into the past with a Decemberists review and the Brit Awards
I’ve never felt so out of place. Walk-
ing past the red carpet, thousands
of screaming fans, hundreds of pho-
tographers, and obscenely wealthy
Londoners covered in all manners
of animal fur, I finally found the
ticket collection office. I was care-
fully watched by the omnipresent
bouncers, probably wondering why
I was even standing there.
After a long climb to the fourth
floor, I was rewarded by the sight
of a set of gigantic proportions.
It was surrounded by thousands
of A-listers and many more tel-
evision cameras. Sadly, despite the
enormous size of the backdrop be-
fore me, I soon realized that from
the fourth floor of Earls Court the
stages appeared miniscule and the
people themselves were singular-
ity points.
By the time the ubiquitous warm-
up guy had cascaded onto the
stage, I was growing increasingly
anxious; however, this was nothing
to do with anticipation for the show,
it was merely due to a camera on a
large mechanical arm which decid-
ed to focus itself on the section of
the audience I was sitting in. After
staring down the levitating camera
for a good few minutes, it suddenly
rotated towards the stage, and the
twenty second countdown blared
out from the speakers.
Russell Brand meandered onto
the podium as the crowd burst into
cheers, many of them reveling at
the fact that they were on televi-
sion. I fortunately escaped this fate
by not being famous enough. Darn.
Apparently this was the first live
showing of the Brit Awards since
1989, so of course everything had
to go perfectly. Even from where
I was perched I could see several
bouncers trying to control some
of the celebrities who had already
gone overboard and were drowning
in a champagne supernova.

ceremony with a generously flam-
boyant rendition of I Don’t Feel
like Dancing with a most bizarre
display of gravity-defying, flying
legs. I know it was executed using
black-clothed dancers on an equal-
ly black background, but again, my
slip on reality increased exponen-
tially. To be honest, I wasn’t really
complaining.
Best Live Act was the first award,
and it was not surprising at all that
Muse topped the list. Each of the
awards was presented by musical
artists or celebrities of particu-
lar note, including Simon Pegg of
Shaun of the Dead fame, and Ricky
Wilson of the Kaiser Chiefs, star of
last year’s Brit Awards ceremony.
Every recipient of each award were
present and accounted for with the
exception of the Arctic Monkeys,
who were clearly away doing more
important things. The seemingly
omnipotent northerners won the
awards for Best British Group and
Best British Album. Seriously, is
there anything they are nominated
for that they don’t win?
Snow Patrol’s performance of
their supremely popular single
Chasing Cars was one of the best
of the night but they walked away
without the award for Best British
Single; that honour went to Take
That and their single Patience,
whose five minutes on stage caused
every single female in the room to
squeal into ultrasound and every
male to cower in fear.
The Red Hot Chili Peppers were
ecstatic upon reaching the stage,
and the crowd-pleasing Dani Cali-
fornia, refreshingly different from
the recorded album version, pro-
voked even the most fur-laden A-
lister kilometers beneath my bal-
cony view to stand to attention.

W
assup y’all?
Well, you may
have noticed
that the music
section has been
sporadic/shambolic in content. If
you haven’t noticed, then thanks
for your ignorance, it makes me
feel better.
Anyway, yeah, to be honest I’ve
not been that excited about much
lately save for the Do Make Say
Think album but that has been on
my various musical playing devic-
es for a while. I’ve seen a couple
of interesting London bands lately
such as Man Aubergine, but they
are lacking something that I can’t
quite put my finger on. Basically, I
need some tunes!
Yea, where are the tunes at? All
I’m hearing lately is aimless drivel
and I think there are many rea-
sons for this. Ultimately, I’d blame
the internet. As much as I think it
is great that you can hear all kinds
of music and get exposure as a
band, that is one of the problems
with it. There are simply too many
bands writing too much music.
Gone are the days when a band
would hone their skill through
laborious writing, gigging and re-
writing before either withering
away into nothing or become a
force to be reckoned with. There
seem to be no great pioneers be-
cause the amount of time they’d
spend playing their music would
force them into making something
they’d love and others would love
too.
However, thanks to MySpace,
illegal copies of recording soft-
ware obtained through Bittorrent
and cheap, available hardware,
anyone can write guff, record and
then get 500 people to listen to
it. There seem to be two options
open to bands now: you meet up,
write some derivative songs, and
whore yourself out because the
songs will be so derivative that
they won’t be challenging to any-
one and you’ll make money (eg.
Arctic Monkeys); the second op-
tion is to make less derivative mu-
sic but be so overwhelmed by the
sheer volume of music around you
that your lack of overt accessibility
means you’ll spend your time play-
ing to just about enough people to
verify your existence as a band
but never get true recognition.
Tomorrow (Saturday 24th Feb-
ruary) we have four bands who
have spent a lot time taking the
second option: come and support
them (look at the poster overleaf).
than many of us were expecting,
convincingly embarrassing Robbie
Willaims for yet again stumbling
into rehab, whilst accurately liken-
ing Amy Whinehouse’s voice to that
of a cab driver.
The Killers, recipients of both
Best International Group and Best
International Album, stunned the
audience with an explosive per-
formance of When You Were Young,
shortly before Corrine Bailey-Rae
showered the Brit School audi-
ence with millions of golden tickets,
probably allowing all of them to fi-
nally enter the legendary chocolate
factory.
During the advert breaks, the
audience was shown clips of last
year’s awards ceremony, but I was
too busy scanning the tables below
me; it seems that a three course
meal set on platinum plates had oc-
curred at some point. Miles above, I
could only think of how much of my
student loan I could pay off with one
of those plates.
Before the end of the perform-
ance, I was horrified to watch Jus-
tin Timberlake accept the award for
Best International Male, over the
poetic Damien Rice. There were
some strange anomalies in the dis-
tribution of the silver statuettes this
year, but this was by far the most
outrageous. It seemed the people
around me concurred, and I was
quite surprised at the bravery of a
certain man to my left who decided
blaring out a particular obscenity
during a relatively quiet section of
the speech was the best course of
action.
Concluding the night was the
highly anticipated extended set of
Oasis, who accepted their award for
Outstanding Contribution to Music
with typical Oasis flare. Liam Gal-
lagher was heard to curse about
something, whereas Noel declared:
“Seeing that we don’t get nominat-
ed for this anymore, I suppose it will
have to do,” before grinning as the
audience exploded back into life.
Their extended set went beyond
the live coverage, and included
Morning Glory, Rock ‘n’ Roll Star,
Cigarettes & Alcohol and the truly
anthemic Don’t Look Back In An-
ger, all of which caused every single
living soul in the gigantic arena to
jump about in celebration of this
band’s legacy, including Gary Light-
body of Snow Patrol and Dominic
Howard of Muse, prominently vis-
ible from the balcony above.
The instant Oasis disappeared,
we were all ushered out of the build-
ing so that the musicians and those
lucky/wealthy enough to obtain a
VIP Pass could commence the after
show party. Making my way down
the (unnecessarily) gargantuan
flight of stairs I was barged out of
the way by several photographers
armed with at least seven cameras
each, all costing probably more
than my annual tuition fees.
I was impressed by the amount of
text messages I had received dur-
ing the two-and-a-half hour show
berating the judges/voters for their
decision regarding Take That’s sin-
gle, perhaps even more significant
was the sheer volume of text mes-
sages I had received regarding my
presence there.
It was probably the most surreal
musical event I have ever been to.
I suppose you could say I was Half
The World Away.

album review
It has been a year since Picaresque,
and boy have I felt it. Fans of the
Decemberists like me are forced to
suffer. The problem is the distinct
lack of any other band which can
replicate the uniquely diverse and
melodic indie-pop that The Decem-
berists produce so effortlessly. How
theymanagetodoitstillbogglesme.
Each track has around ten different
instruments chirping and tweeting
in the background, yet they always
compliment each other to create a
perfectly balanced song.
It’s here that The December-
ists’ strength lies. The flexibility
of their instrumentation enables
them to craft each and every sec-
ond of sound exactly as they want
it. The rich atmospheres they cre-
ate completely absorb you without
you even knowing it, transporting
you to the fantastical worlds they
are describing.
Take for example the title track,
The Crane Wife 1 & 2. This twelve
minute epic retells part of an old
Japanese story in exquisite detail
(the first track on the album, The
Crane Wife 3 finishes it). The beau-
ty in the song comes in the transi-
tions between the chapters.
The opening verse contains only a
plucked guitar with touches of vio-
lin, exactly mirroring the isolation
experienced by the poor farmer.
As he stumbles across an injured
crane which he nurses back to
health, the song musically explodes.
Horns blow, symbols crash and or-
gans squeal for mercy. The amaz-
ing burst of energy wakes us from
the depression of the first verse, as
the crane jolted the farmer out of
his misery.
That is the brilliant thing about
The Decemberists; you can read
as deep as you like into their mu-
sic, but at the end of the day it just
sounds great. For anyone who likes
music with its heart on its sleeve,
I couldn't recommend this album
more.
