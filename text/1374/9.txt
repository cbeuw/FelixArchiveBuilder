Nobody can deny that our Union
bars need improving.
If I were elected I would seek
to improve this by ensuring that
all bar staff are trained to a high
standard.
All too often we receive service
which is poor and slow, some-
times even to the point of down-
right rudeness.
I have worked and have been in-
volved in training in bars before,
and know exactly how to turn
them around.
After that, I would seek to intro-
duce a wider range of drinks, in-
cluding cocktails, and more beers
(Stella!!!) on tap.
aAlso, I would try and get later
drinking licenses for end of term
events.
With the smoking ban coming in,
we are set to lose the shisha bar.
I would strive to keep this by
introducing patio heaters and
a marquee to allow shisha to
be comfortably smoked in all
weather.
The sorry state of food in the un-
ion will be addressed as well, with
prices better reflecting what you
are paying for.
Waterstones has shut down. We
are one of the few universities
in the UK without a bookshop.
A union run bookshop should be
on campus – it is a necessity for
students.
Although I may be inexperi-
enced, I believe I, as well as the
rest of “the Slate”, am what the
Union needs. Fresh ideas, and
a new outlook on things, rather
than tired old career politician
students.
Vote for me, and “the Slate”,
if you feel that our Union needs
change.

Firstly, I would like to thank all
those students who have seconded
me to make it possible to run in
this forthcoming election for the
role of DPFS, those of you know
who you are and thanks, it means
a lot!
ICU is going through exciting
changes with refurbishments and
the implementation of its 5 year
strategy plan, the governance re-
view and its affiliation to NUS.
Why should YOU vote Calder;
• As I will full fill the duties laid
out in the constitution regarding
the DPFS role to the best of my
ability.
• Make sure campus clubs do not
feel isolated from ICU if they are
not based in South Kensington by
keeping in contact and helping
where necessary.
• Supporting the President in
implementing the current Union
Strategy.
• Ensure that ICU Clubs and So-
cieties spend their money wisely.
• Make sure the changes made
this year to ICU such as the gov-
ernance review are successfully
fulfilled.
• Help ensure we run successful
and entertaining events within the
Union.
• As I already have a fairly good
understanding on how the financ-
es of ICU work, I will explore ways
on improving the system.
• Work on trying to satisfy the
student’s needs regarding the
services ICU offer.
And:
• Depending on what my powers
permit me to do so; research and
explore the possibility of develop-
ing an ICU brand amongst clubs
and societies in line with other
large universities such as Bath.

With three years of involvement in the
Unionrangingfromworkingpart-time
in the Student Activities Centre, sit-
ting on numerous committees, to be-
ing RSM CSC Treasurer, I’ve become
familiar with the role of the DPFS. A
small selection of problems I have
identified over the last few months
include:
1) Clubs and societies are a credit to
the Union but are supported with out-
dated and inadequate systems.
2) Event planning can be daunting
and is rarely done properly.
3)Despitesubstantialchangesinthe
Union’sbarsthereisinconsistentpric-
ing and do not cater for all students.
4) Catering is the subject of discon-
tent for many, and cannot compete
with other facilities on campus.
5) The finance system is not trans-
parent and is relatively poorly under-
stood by officers.
If elected, I promise to…
1) Review the Union’s money con-
trol mechanism with the aim of re-
ducing bureaucracy and delays when
processing claims.
2)Produceacomprehensivefinance
training program, including planning
for very large events.
3) Where possible reduce bar prices
(including non-alcoholic drinks), and
make positive steps with Union staff
to find cheaper suppliers.
4) Work to increase the quality of the
Union food and would encourage initi-
atives to bring students into the Union
at lunchtimes.
5)Encouragechangesinthefinance
structure to allow for greater trans-
parency and accountability.
I believe I am the most experienced
candidate standing and have the
knowledge, enthusiasm and work-
ing relationships to make a positive
impact on our Union. Vote Chris for
DPFS.

As Imperial becomes affiliated with
the NUS once more, the role of
the DPFS is more significant than
ever.
With the NUS affiliation fees
coming out of the Union budget,
the importance of a responsible
and effective figure as DPFS can-
not be overstated.
I will make sure that not only
would the remaining budget be
managed more effectively, but
also that Imperial students are
able to take the greatest advan-
tage of the services provided by
the NUS.
I recognise that students have
to stretch their own budget out, so
I will ensure that the best possi-
ble facilities are available without
pricing them out of reach of the
vast majority of students.
With this in mind, I will keep hall
rents in check so they remain af-
fordable to everyone.
I fimly believe that facilities
such as the gym must stay free to
all Imperial students, and guaran-
tee that this will remain the case.
I will make certain bar pric-
es stay down - since the loss of
Southside bar, there is no compe-
tition to keep prices low, and I will
not allow students to suffer as a
result.
I will also broaden the range of
Union events, while keeping their
prices down.
There is a growing feeling that
the Union fails to represent all
students fully.
Not only will I be directly ac-
countable to you, but I will also
make myself available at all times
for anyone to bring any concerns
to me.
For a responsible and account-
able DPFS, vote for Hugh.
