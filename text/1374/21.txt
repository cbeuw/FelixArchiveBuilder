N
ightlife is back, and I
apologise for the lack
of content recently, it
was all down to tech-
nical problems, lack
of material and mainly, my lazi-
ness. To make up for this, I’ve cre-
ated a lovely double page spread
for your reading pleasures, and
just like the pork content of a Pep-
perami, I’m 150% dedicated to this
page again. That means we need
more reviewers to go forth and re-
view. Make the most of it whilst you
still have a will to live, and before
the exams start to hit you hard,
just send an email to the address
at the top of the page, and we’ll be
glad to accommodate your needs.
If nobody writes reviews, there
won’t be a page because I sure as
hell don’t have time to go out and
write them all. If you don’t want to
write for us, you could always just
email us anyway, we get quite sad
and lonely down here in the Felix
office.
Anyway, enough rubbish about
rubbish, this week you’ll see by
turning your eyes slightly to the
right, we’ve gone Hard House and
Trance crazy. Caz Knight was nice
enough to write an account of her
night out a while back, when she
checked out Tidy at Heaven, and
Taz Aliabadi had a wonderful time
with the weird hippie goings on
at The Synergy Project in SeOne,
and it sounds like quite a night by
how the review reads. Very con-
fusing. This is why we don’t touch
those mushrooms kids.
In other nightlife related news,
if you haven’t heard already, the
wonderful And Did We Mention
Our Disco is returning on Friday
23rd February, with super secret
special guests, and by their past
list of acts, the won’t disappoint.
I might even attend. It’s sure
to be better than the let down of
a new Indie ‘superclub’ (those
words should never go together)
Chalk. Nick Simpson checked it
out the other week, and I must
say - I agree with his account of
the night, when I went there for
the Ed Bangers party recently,
the place was basically filled with
hyperactive 17 year old children.
I mean, it’s just plain depressing
with you are the oldest person in
the room.
Finally, don’t forget to enter our
lovely competition this week to get
yourself some free tickets to The
End. See over the page for more
details.
We’re
back.
Again.

Tidy vs. Extreme Euphoria.
Hard House in Heaven
It’s time for...HOUSE. The Tidy boys and friends take over everyone’s favourite gay
club, but fail to do themselves justice musically. Caz Knight checks it out
events usually kick off at 10pm so
the delayed 11pm start was a little
disappointing, but none the less we
all waited patiently in line for the
doors to open. Nearly bursting with
excitement I almost sprinted into
the main room to get my groove
on. Surprisingly, the music kicked
off with Trevor Machlalan playing
a very eclectic set, starting off with
funky house/electro progressing
into some filthy psy-trance and
then onto the much awaited for
hard house we had all come for.
Not perturbed by the slightly
slow start to the evening, we
kept on open mind to the ensuing
sets. Unfortunately we were a
little disappointed until one of my
favourite DJs, BK, came on at
2am. Pure musical ecstasy where
I danced with all the energy I had
Chalk?! Bring back Trash I say.
Trash is dead, long live Durrr. Well
it is what everyone is thinking, but
the truth is there is more than one
new electro/alternative night in
London these days. On January
13th Chalk was launched at Scala
- a three room extravaganza that
has already played host to everyone
from Shitdisco to Whitey. For the
love of the readers this intrepid re-
porter, as a sign of pure dedication,
invested a Saturday night to attend
what could be the new Our Disco
and Trash all rolled into one.
We are all told appearances are
everything, and sticking by that
maxim Chalk got off to a pretty
shite start; although the queue
wasn’t filled with dreary, arsehole
Trash-ites it was full of a gaggle of
Chelsea sixth formers, drinking
Lambrini and Rose from the bottle -
nice. Inside it didn’t improve much,
there where bedraggled teens who
could hardly dress slouched in the
stairwells smoking as if it was just
another lunch break behind the
physics block and the dance floors
of all three rooms were about as
lively as a coma patient.
To anyone who hasn’t been, Scala
is a pretty big venue, spread over 3
rooms (although one is just an an-
nex to a bar), two harboured live
bands and DJs. After a fucking
horrendous wait for the cloakroom
we headed upwards and onwards,
through the tiny stairwell to see
a superb set from the Foals, fresh
from playing Durrr on Monday. 50
minutes of twatish dancing later,
we moved on downstairs, awaiting
Radioclit. Because we were ‘super-
sweet-cool’ like all the other tossers
there we naturally spent the whole
time pushing past people, calling
them gay, pouring beer down peo-
ples backs, not dancing, sitting on
the floor and getting super stoked
about tequila. Occasionally you
could spot a seasoned club goer and
without a doubt their expressions
read ‘what the fuck is this’. Gritting
our teeth to bare it we threw shapes
in the squalor that was room three
until a mustachioed man beat us at
Tidy vs Extreme Euphoria
Heaven
26th January

stored up over the last month.
Relentless driving bass lines,
classic tunes such as ‘909’ kept
everyone going with no breaks for
the full hour. Next on in the main
room were Organ Donors. Their
sets at Tidy weekender 10 and
Dance Valley left me expecting
nothing sort of a work of art, yet
I couldn’t get into the music: a bit
too much scratching and a bit too
hard if that’s possible! The rest of
my group seemed satisfied with it
though.
The three other rooms gave a
change from the hard house in the
mainroomwithfunkyhouse,electro
and trance: A rest was much needed
after 2 hours of non stop dancing
in the main room. Andy Whitby,
named the ‘Saviour” of hard house
by his following, disappointed once
again with too much cheese and
desecrating classic tunes. The only
3 minutes of the set I enjoyed was
a remix of Cade del Mar’s “energy
52”. From then on the rest of the
night let Tidy down with a poor
show from Tidy Boys themselves.
From a musical perspective
the night didn’t do itself justice,
however, much fun was had more
because of the people there and the
friends I came with.
I spent most of the night looking
forward to my friend’s after party
which was to follow immediately
after [funnily enough].
I might think twice before
attending the next Tidy event in
April, although Tidy weekender 11
will definitely be one to look forward
to!

After a whole month off from club-
bing and any form of dance music
throughout January (to detox and
get my brain back in working order
for lectures and exams) January
26th couldn’t come soon enough: My
reintroduction to aural hedonism!
Being a huge fan of anything Tidy,
be it previous Tidy vs Extreme Eu-
phoria events, weekenders or music
from the record label, I was sure I’d
be guaranteed an awesome night in
one of my favourite London clubs.
Heaven, owned by none other
than Virgin’s Richard Branson, is
usually a gay club (please don’t go
during the week: mondays-fridays it
plays a dodgy mix of RnB and club
classics and unless you are gay I’m
sure you wouldn’t appreciate be-
ing groped as you make your way
across the dancefloor!). However,
at Tidy there’s nothing to make the
non-gay community uncomfort-
able: quite the opposite, when you
go to Tidy events you find yourself
amongst a very friendly and colour-
ful crowd, something very refresh-
ing form the usual drunken brawls
you find yourself surrounded by at
a lo of “mainstream” clubs. Heaven
has a 2000 capacity and because of
its layout, one never feels cramped
and it never takes more than a few
minutes to find your way to the toi-
lets or be served at the bar.
Not wanting to undo all the good
from my detox and to be able to
properly stomp to my favourite DJs,
I decided to stick to water (£2.50)
and red bull (£2.60), not too bad
comparedtosomeclubsinHeaven’s
vicinity. The only frustration came
from not being allowed to take
bottles into the toilets to refill them
due to Heaven’s newly enforced
strict drugs policy.
Tidy vs Extreme Euphoria
Too much scratching and hard house that’s too hard. Yep, that’s right

dancing like a penis - well that and,
as mentioned, getting fed up pre-
pubescent tits pouring beer on us;
just lets not forget, the music was
damn good.
Chalk runs to 6:00am, a time
reached only by the most ardent
clubbers, but clearly mummy had
sent Jeffery, the driver for all the
poor little rich girls for 3:00am and
by the time Radioclit started proper
in room 1, the place was starting to
feel empty.
By 3:15am the night was all but
over. Undoubtedly Chalk has out-
standing acts playing every week,
but like Trash before it, the weak-
ness lies in the people, at least they
are mildly more palatable this time
around.
