IC THIRD IN ROAD RELAY
This year the race was held on Saturday,Mareh
3rd, over the now f a m i l i a r course of.' E? miles.The
conditions f o r the raoe were f a r from i d e a l . There
was a cold, blustering wind blowing against the run-
ners at the staift, down Rotten Row.
Twenty-two teams lined up f o r the s t a r t , a
record number f o r the event. Every one went away
very fast - the f i r s t two hundred yards were almost
a f l a t sprint. At Marble Arch, i t was seen that
L.S.E., Lough borough, R.V.Gigg's team, and King's
were well up i n fiumtt with I.C. running a disorg-
anized twelth. This order was maintained u n t i l
the sedond lap, but I.C. began to move up to eighth
position; Loughb&rough, after two laps were some
100 yds. clear Of King's, with R.V.Gigg's team and
L.S.E. well back. After four laps King's had over-
taken Loughborough, and had b u i l t up a convincing
lead - I.C. by virtue of some excellent running by
G.C.Kay and M.Garrod were now running third, ahead
of Birmingham and Manchester, with Battersea Poly.,
the holders i n sixth position. These positions
were maintained during the f i f t h lap, with King's
increasing their lead, and I.C. struggling with
Birmingham Univ. f o r t h i r d place. During the
f i n a l lap sme r e a l l y fine running was seen - T.
Betteridge of King's broke the tape some 300 yds.
ahead o f J.Disley, Loughborough - the B r i t i s h Inter-
national Steeplechaser. Ted Whitlock ran i n t h i r d
for I.C., well ahead of L.Hughes, of-'Birmingham.
It i s s i g n i f i c a n t to note that the f i r s t nine,
teams home beat l a s t year's record time madeb y
Battersea Poly. - t h i s r e f l e c t s the astonishing rise
in the standard of running.
F i n a l po s it1ons:-
1. King's College, London 84 min 06 sec
2. Loughborough College 84 " 47 "
3. Imperial Coligge 85 " 10 "

The fastest individual lap times were:-
1. J.Disley (Loughborough) 13 - 41
2. F.Whitlock (I.C.) 13 - 44
3. M.Barrett (Battersea) 13 - 49
John Disley's time constitutes a new record f o r
the course, and Ted Whitlock's time also beat the
previous reoord.
The I.C. 2nd team, who also competed, came i n
a very creditable twelfth, behind L.S.E.
I.C. put up a very commendable performance i n
t h i s event and the r e s u l t s show that we are s t i l l
in the forfront of u n i v e r s i t y a t h l e t i o s .

In the l a s t and most s u c c e s s f u l Brains Trust,
held on Monday 26th Febiraary, Mr- H a s k e l l was bare-
ly able t o control Miss Anona Winn, Miss Ursula
Jeans, Mr. Kingsley % r t i n , Prof. H a l l , and Prof.
Levy, who each had a chance t o expound on' t h e i r own
pet subject.,;' * « t o . i a w c X I o . \;-i-i9iiS
The most excited d i s c u s s i o n of a l l , however,
was on t h e subject of the comparative e f f i c i e n c y o f
the sexes.
To a s t r i c t l y t e c h n i c a l audience the point
was made that there had been no outstanding creative
woman a r t i s t s . Had t h i s Brains Tpust been held
with the R.C.A., R.C.M. and R.C.D.A. as our guests,
t h i s point would have kept South Kensington i n a
state of gentle uproar f o r many moons.
It was g r a t i f y i n g to see t h a t , when asked how
to dispose o f £10,000 our g u e s t s , a l l wanted t o help
the impecunious student, with the exception o f one
who wanted to s t a r t up a r i v a l t o FELIX.
A 'quickie' showed that the Brains Trust would
l i k e t o walk on forbidden mountain paths, lose t h e i r
i d e n t i t y cards, perform uncensored plays, drink a l l
night and repeal Order 1305-

The R.S.M. defeated C & G. by a goal (5 pts.)
to a penalty goal (3 pts.) i n the annual cup match
at. Harlington on Feb. 28th. The game was fast but
more notable f o r i t s vigour, and successful s p o i l -
ing, than f o r constructive f o o t b a l l . Guilds took
the lead early on with a penalty goal kicked by Lap-
pin, and retained t h e i r three point lead u n t i l ten
minutes from the end. , Then bad p o s i t i o n i n g i n de-
fence by Guilds' threequarters allowed Curry to score
from a good back movement i n which the Mines' forw-
ards also took part. Davies converted the t r y
from a wide angle, the b a l l bouncing onthe cross-bar
before going over. Both sides had e a r l i e r f a i l e d
to take t h e i r opportunities t o score , and on the
afternoon's play there was l i t t l e t o choose between
them, although R.S.M. had the l i v e l i e r and more
d i s c i p l i n e d pack. - : s e i l q e i Tottrdf.

A r i s i n g from the f r u s t r a t i o n o f c e r t a i n students
of t h e i r E l e c t r i c a l Department, the Guilds Meeting
on Monday 26th Feb. devoted most t>t i t s time to a
motion-proposing that Union membership should be ex-
tended t q the s e c r e t a r i e s o f the College. This pro-
posal t o L i l y the Guilds provided an excellent sub-
j e c t f o r an all-male meeting; despite the arguments
of the r e c i p r o c a l s o c i a l and a t h l e t i c advantages,the
motion was overwhelmingly defeated. However, the
President promised to pursue some o f the points r a i -
