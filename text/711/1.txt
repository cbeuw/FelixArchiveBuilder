Boat
Bonanza
•Boat Club winning at Henley: Will
they have a new boat next year?
Imperial College Boat
Club are to get a new
eight, despite the decision
of UFC that the Union
can not afford one. The
sabbaticals reversed the
UFC decision when it was
revealed that Athletics
Clubs Committee had
underspent by a
significant amount.
At an emergency UFC, in
early June, boat club claimed
they needed a new eight every
two years because eights lost
two lengths every year. The
meeting decided, though, that
as the estimates for equipment
expenditure were about six
thousand pounds over budget
the plans to buy a new eight
had to be scrapped. It was
also revealed at the same
meeting that the estimates for
recurrent expenditure were
about four thousand pounds
over budget. The sabbaticals
argued that this might be
covered by the money
allocated for this year that
hadn't been spent. At the
same meeting STOIC'S
application for a thousand
pounds for a new studio were
turned down.
The executive are only
empowered to make urgent
decisions and decisions on
matter of discipline. Several
senior Union Officers are said
to be concerned that this
decision was not left until the
first UFC of term. They claim
this would have given boat
club enough time to buy the
new eight and train for the
major regattas in it. Other
officers say that the boat isn't
needed at all. They quote
Olympic standard rowers who
say that boats don't lose two
lengths a year.
Union President, Carl
Burgess said that the decision
had been made by the
outgoing sabbaticals. He
added that he supported the
decision.
President
Banned
•Carl Burgess: 'Wrecking his room.'
Carl Burgess, ICU
President, has been
banned from living in
Room 434, Linstead Hall,
the room that is
traditionally occupied by
IC Union Presidents. The
decision was taken after
Dr Richard Clarke,
Warden of Linstead Hall,
objected to having Mr
Burgess in his hall
because of his reputation
for wrecking his room.
At a meeting of hall wardens
to discuss where Union
officers would be housed, Dr
'Clarke complained that the
room Mr Burgess had
occupied in Southside this
year was in such a state that
the cleaners had refused to go
in it. He went on to say that he
wasn't prepared to have
someone with that sort of
record living in his hall.
Mr Burgess claims that he
has been picked upon. He
says that he has been unable
to discuss the problem with Dr
Clarke because the complaint
was made while he was in the
middle of his examinations. Mr
Burgess claims that he is not
bothered by the decision. He
believes he will have more
freedom to criticise College
residence policy if he isn't
resident in an IC hall.
Mr Burgess moved out of
Falmouth-Keogh hall at
Easter. When he left the
cleaners insisted that they
were given full sets of
protective clothing including
face masks. Mr Burgess claims
this was an over reaction. He
says that in his view the room
was in quite good condition
considering the cleaners had
refused to touch it for six
months.
Normally sabbaticals have
their hall bills payed by the
Union. In this case Mr Burgess
is being payed the money
directly. Mr Burgess is at
present living at home while
he looks for a flat.
Mary Attenborough, ICU
President 1978/79, was the last
President not to live in College
halls, or houses.
Henley
Hi-Jinks
This week has been
particularly trying in the
FELIX office. Not only was
the typesetter playing up but
we were beseiged by hordes
of students trying vainly to
get into the Union Office.
The FELIX staff were forced
to stop thier toil to patiently
explain that all the
sabbaticals and Union Staff
had gone on a picnic.
It bodes well for next year
that the organisation of this
'outing' has taken the office
over two weeks. After
several false starts, the final
date was set with a
suggestion, believed to have
been by Jen Hardy-Smith,
that everyone should go to
the races. After discovering
that the nearest races were
in Folkestone, a relaxing day
at Henley was decided
upon. Union Receptionist
Kathy Tait was overheard in
the Union Bar, saying that
she'd been to purchase over
£50 of food for the junket on
the Union's behalf.
