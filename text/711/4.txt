| This is the ideal book for
| between
| lectures/study/groups/tut-
I orials. It is a pot pourri of
| varied folk tales and
I ballads—69 in total; most
| beautifully rewritten, in the
I original vernacular English, as
1 is the tale 'seeing or
I believing'. The range of
1 subjects covered is so vast
I that there's something for all
| tastes, supernatural tales
about Faeries, Ghosts, Giants
I and the Devil, stories about
1 Saints and Martyrs, Witches
1 Rakes, fabulous beasts,
1 domestic stories—only one of
, them about wife
I battering—and moral tales,
§ where the good guy/gal
always wins in the end, even
I if they re dead and their ghost
1 has to do the revenging.
There are stories from all
I over England—from Cornwall
i to Durham, any Northerners
won't feel aggrieved, but the
Welsh, Scottish and Irish will
have to buy their own books
I of folk tales.
The editor, Shelia Marshall,
I is herself from the depths of
the country, where such tales
florish, and her informative
S introduction gives the line to
if amazing scholarship, without
1 being pretensious.
This is not a childish book
by any means—it won the
f$ Angel literary Award in 1982,
but it is a relaxing read, which
ft wouldn t strain the intellect
H even of a miner the kind of
thing for between heat strikes
and Shroedinger, or before
going to bed with a mug of
ovaltine.
A State Of Affairs
by Graham Swannell,
§j at the Duchess Theatre.
Oh dear, bored again, I'm
1 afraid. Its not that I couldn't
understand Graham
Swannell's new play, it's just
that it is aimed at all those
young aspiring people who
:. are married with kids and an
affair to support. And quite
frankly, I'm not.
Apart from appealing to an
::: elite audience, much of the
play's ambiguity lies in the
fabric of the text. Black
humour is a delicate vehicle
and unfortunately Swannell
neatly separates drama from
humour in all the sketches,
leaving the audience at best
bemused, often bewildered.
Moreover the plays are
remarkably chauvenist.
Women's views are lightly
defused behind stock cliches;
here married man holds the
reins and always comes out
on top. A bitter irony, with no
solutions attached, this 'stab
at marriage' is far more a case
of wife-battering.
Cassandra
by Christa Wolf
This imaginative and tense
account of the fall of Troy,
written by a woman described
by the Guardian as 'an East
German Virginia Woolf has
many disturbing and thought-
provoking messages buried in
the narrative.
The story is told by the
prophetess Cassandra,
daughter of King Priam, and
as it unfolds the multiple
absurdities of the war strike
us as they can only strike an
onlooker in any conflict. The
presence or absence of Helen
makes little difference to the
war. Although it is over her
that the war is purportedly
started, it is continued of a
mixture of folly, conceit,
habit, ambition and blood
lust, until the unhappy
conclusion when the
inhabitants of Troy are
overwhelmed and the Greeks
take a bloody revenge of
murder, rape, looting and
kidnapping for their dead
soldiers buried by the City
walls.
Anyone who imagines.the
Ancient Greeks to have been
a cultured, honourable people
Has your computer just
been sick all over your
printout? Waiting for a
reaction to complete? Rain
washed out play? In your
spare time, why not try
something that's simple, fun,
and could win you a
valuable prize—creative
writing! In each issue over
the summer (sic), we'll be
presenting various type of
writing for you to try your
hand at. We start with
probably the simplest type,
the rhyming poems,
examples of which can be
seen in most 'Greetings
Cards'. Although the subject
matter of the following
poem is pretty serious
(unrequited love), note the
almost 'happy' rhythmn.
'Shadows'
Shadows of the dark are
rare,
More get get seen in
daylights glare,
A gift I give, the whole day
through,
I give my Shadow to you...
To laugh, to cry,
To have, to share,
My Shadow will e'er be
there,
With hurt and pain
And joys to share,
My Shadow will still be
there,
Through laugh and sorrow,
Secrets to know,
My Shadow will never go,
I have one wish, a hope, a
plea,
When will you give your
Shadow to me?
When you find a 'beat'
you're happy with, try to
vary it, slightly at first. The
inversion in the next poem
destroys the flow, but I think
it emphasises its circular
nature.
The towers-that we build so
high,
You pushed me, falling,
screaming, Why?
Through short free-fall I
didn't care
for life again, without you
there,
Who picked me up I yet not
know.
Friend or foe,
Know not yet
Joke or bet.
But hand-in-hand we climb
that stair,
Each step taken with greater
care.
Maybe this time we'll find
out why,
The towers that we build so
high.
Now it's your turn! Any
subject, but keep it
short(ish) as it's easy to get
carried away! If you've
pleased with your efforts,
send them to me via the
FELIX Office. By Friday 2nd
August. Please tell me if it's
your first effort, whether
you'd mind seeing it printed
either here or in the
hallowed pages of 'The
Phoenix', and what you
think of my efforts! There is
a £10 prize for the best
poem published. Happy
writing...
'Where would the world of
writing be,
Without some anonimity.'
(ANON)
will be in for a rude shock.
Cassandra's desperation as
she watches her compatriots'
characters change under
pressure from the happy,
more peaceable Trojans, to
becoming brutuish uncaring
'half animal, half children' as
the Greeks were described,
.gives the clue to the first
message of the book; that to
defeat an enemy you should
not become like them.
The second major message
will be familiar to both
feminists and peace
campaigners alike; wars are
started by men, for their
greater agony and ambition
and are suffered mutely (or
not so mutely) by women.
These ideas are expressed
more clearly in the four
essays at the end of the book.
These are hardly bedtime
reading, however if you are
content to take Cassandra at
face value: its exquisite
language and natural
expression, then the novel
itself is revealing and a
readable book.

Woody Allen has been
getting very pretentious lately.
Midsummer Night's Sex
Comedy, Zelig, Broadway
Danny Rose; after a perennial
spate of films with
significance as small as their
taking have been large, at last
there comes a film which, as
well as being simple and
precise, is also devoid of
Woody Allen in any acting
role.
In this, Woody Allen's
umpteenth 'new idea', Jeff
Daniels plays Gil Shepherd
plays Tom Baxter, a screen
character disenchanted with
his film, who falls hopelessly
in love with Cecilia, (played
by Mia Farrow), a maltreated
housewife who finds her
release in romances at the
local movie-house. Baxter
sweeps her off her feet, but
finds he has trouble in
adjusting to the 'real world' on
the other side of the screen.
Meanwhile Gil Shepherd, his
acting career jeorpardised by
his own creation, attempts to
reason with Baxter, whilst
secretly stealing the girl he
loves.
Although a little hackneyed,
The Purple Rose Of Cairo is a
delightful film in all respects,
and its concepts of love and
the movies, the romance of
the cinema, are concise and
exact, lightly enhanced by
Allen's unexpected humour.
