d l From DaWd J Green
Chairman, Industrial Society
Dear Sir,
I read with interest and
disappointment your article
and editorial concerning
Industrial Society in the last
issue of FELIX (No 710). I .
would like to clarify a
number of points and
correct a few inaccuracies.
1. Indsoc does not hold two
bank accounts in its
name—it has one external
account consisting of a
current and a deposit
account.
2. That account is used to
manage money generated
by our annual Careers Fair.
No Union money has ever
been paid into the account.
3. Dave Parry's letter was
dated 10th June 1985, and
was not received by myself
until 12th June, 5 days
before our summer tour. It
was the first formal
communication made to
myself or any of my
predecessors.
4. The letter was, in fact,
discussed at out committee
meeting of the year on
Friday 14th June.
5. On Sunday 16th June,
more than half the

committee were on Summer
Tour in Eire—a fact which
the old exec knew.
6. Contact was attempted
with Nigel Graham after
returning from Eire, but as
he was on holiday, no
contact could be arranged.
7. Dave Parry was informed
of the situation and we were
assured that the new exec
would be told as well.
8. Previously, during the
summer term, at least two
other meetings were
arranged with Nigel Graham
and/or the S C C Chairman,
Shamin Pirzada to begin
discussing the problem. On
each occasion, Indsoc was
PG Tips
If the postgraduate group is
to be functional and PGs
are to be represented
properly on both IC Union
and College Committees
then it is important that a
new Postgraduate Academic
Affairs Committee be
elected before the start of
the next session. To this
end there will be a General
Meeting of the PG Group on
the 31st of July, at 6.00pm
in the Holland Club, to elect
a new committee. The
following posts are up for
grabs, and here is a brief
resume of their
responsibilities.
PGAAO:-To co-ordinate
the running of the group. To
sit on Graduate Studies and
Board of Studies, both
college committees, and IC
Council and Academic
represented only to find that

Unfortunately we have been
forced to cut this epic due
to lack of space. Part 2 will

New Boat.
Imperial College has, at
present, a projected deficit
next year of four thousand
pounds. This means that,
unless the Union managed
to underspend last year,
clubs will have to take
further cuts. Ian Bull's
decision to give boat club a
new eight makes this more
likely. Carl Burgess has the
opportunity still to reverse
the decision and that is
what he must do. Boat Club
is one of IC Union's most
successful and prestigious
clubs. Year after year it has
won. However it is arguable
whether they need a new
eight to compete at this
level. Many top rowers claim
that the boat club has
successfully conned UFC
With many other clubs
facing severe problems as
the result of the cuts they
have been forced to take, it
is amazing that Boat Club
are given such a luxury.
The decision itself was
not quite as bad, though, as
the way it was taken. UFC
had made it quite clear that
they regarded a new eight
as a luxury. UFC is one of
the most representative
committees of IC Union. It
is made up of people with
wide experience of College.
They decided that a new
eight was low priority and
there should have been no
further discussion. Instead
Ian Bull, a former A C C
chairman, was persuaded
into making an executive
decision. Others have
described it as lan's parting
gift to A C C while I wouldn't
be so cynical. It would seem
that Ian has a very bad
memory. That is the only
way I can explain the way
he seems to have forgotten
the debate at UFC and
forgotten to consult the
members of UFC still at
college.
Fortunately, Carl can, and
must, reverse the decision.
The problem of the boat
club should then be brought
to the first UFC of term. A
decision on how six
thousand pounds should be
spent cannot be left to
sabbaticals alone.
Carl In Linstead.
Dr. Richard Clarke is
criticised by many residents
of Linstead for trying to turn
the Hall into a sort of public
school dormitory. He is
accused of going on patrol
at eleven o' clock at night to
make sure that there is
absolutely no noise. While
discipline is essential in any
hall, Halls should be lively
Affairs Committee, which
are student committees.
To give advice and help
on any problems that may
arise between students and
supervisors. To advise the
other officers of the student
union on any matters
relating to PG's.
Treasurer:-To handle the
Groups funds.
Secre.fary:-To print tickets,
posters etc. for social events
and keep minutes of any
meetings held (not a very
difficult job this one!).
UG Liason Officer:-A post
for a Third/Fourth year
thinking of going onto
Postgraduate Studies.
Two ordinary members:-
To organise social events
and do anything else that is
needed.
If anybody is interested in
any of these and would like
further information I can be
contacted via the IC Union .
Office.
One word of warning, if a
committee is not elected by
the start of the new year
then the PG Group won't
run and I shall have no
hesitataion in handing back
the money allocated to us
for the next year so it can
be given to people who are
actually interested enough
to put it to good use.

places where first year
students are encouraged to
take part in the social life.
Dr Clarke's latest decision
seems to be part of his
policy aimed at killing hall
social life. Carl has
undoubtably left his room
on occasion in a revolting
state. However, he is IC
Union President. He was
elected democratically. He
represents IC students.
Linstead benefits from
having the President as a
resident. Invariably the
President does contribute to
the hall social life. Dr Clarke
himself has been quoted as
saying that one of the
reasons that Linstead is the
best hall is that the
President is in residence.
Carl needs to be on
campus, so Dr Clarke
should back down.
