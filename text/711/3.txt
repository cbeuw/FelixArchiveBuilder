C^t-D'E'A'S-
Summer Special
• Meditating-
The Easy Way
If you've been feeling tense
recently then the answer
could be meditation. There's
a free introductory talk on
the subject at Kensington
Library, Camden Hill Rd.,
W.8., every Monday at 8pm.
•Holograms
There's an opportunity to
view the largest and most
comprehensive exhibition of
Soviet holography ever
staged in the Western World
at the Trocadero, Piccadilly.
It has over 150 holograms
including those of priceless
masterpieces from the
Hermitage along with the
applications of holography
in science. It's open daily
from 10am to 10pm until
30th September. Admission
£1 for students.
•Spanish Devils
This Sunday there's a
special treat for all of you
who couldn't afford to go to
Spain this year. Battersea
Park takes on a Spanish
flavour as Els Comediants, a
collective from Catalonia,
take part in the London
International Festival of
Theatre. It sounds all good
pagan fun as they perform a
druid-type ritual called 'The
Devils'. Watch out if you do
go though as when they
played this piece in Granada
a group of christian
extremists laid into the
audience with iron crosses!
•The Proms
The Henry Wood
Promenade Concerts are
currently running at the
Royal Albert Hall until
September 14th. Tonight
conductor Pierre Boulez is
leading his Ensemble
Intercontemporain at
7.30pm after having given a
free Pre-Prom talk in the
Union Hall at 6.15pm.
Tickets for this are a special
price of £3.75 for all seating
and are available from the
box office before 6.00pm.
However, if you don't mind
standing and you want to
get into the spirit of things,
the promenade tickets are
the best value at £1.40
(Arena) and £1.10 (Gallery).
Unfortunately these are only
obtainable on the night of
the performance so be
prepared to queue.
•TV Tickets
It's often possible to get free
tickets for TV and radio
shows and concerts. Just
send a stamped addressed
envelope to B B C Ticket
Unit, Broadcasting House,
W1A 4WW or phone Thames
TV on 01-387 9494 and
London Weekend Television
on 01-261 3434.
•Free Concert
As part of GLC's 'Jobs for
London '85' Festival there's
a open-air concert called
'Urban Sax'. It's outside
County Hall on the South
Bank on Saturday August
3rd at 8.30pm and promises
to be quite an experience. It
features 65 saxophonist and
it's free (so it can't be bad).
If you want to go then the
nearest tube is Waterloo.
