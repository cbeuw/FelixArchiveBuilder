So, what is
science, anyway?
Scientists are often sure they know the
answer to this question, since, after
all. science is what they do for a
living. However, when they are faced
with the problem of actually defining
what science is, or the problem of
distinguishing between science and
non-science, then they often find
themselves at a loss for words. In
some ways doing science is a
substitute for thinking about it: so,
when it comes to the crunch, many
scientists find that they have not
actually given much thought to what
they spend their lives doing.
It has been argued that the
philosophy of science (that is
questions about the nature of science)
is irrelevant to scientists and should
be relegated to the arts where it is the
done thing to spend endless hours in
frenetic debate about subjects of no
relevance whatsoever. Most scientists
seem to be getting on quite well in
their day-to-day work without having
a detailed philosophy of their subject.
So why bother?
The first, and probably the best,
reason for thinking about the nature
of science is that if we knew what we
were doing we might be able to do it
better. A good philosophy of science
would contain a sort of general
procedure for doing , good
experiments. By 'good experiment' I
mean one that advances knowledge as
efficiently as possible: a bad
experiment wastes time and effort
without really telling us anything
new. Another good reason is that a
clear philosophy of science may help
us to avoid the misuse of the results
of science: without a clear idea of the
limits of science we cannot guard
ourselves against cults of pseudo-
scientific unreason. A good
philosophy should help us to
distinguish what is scientific from
what is not (though the dividing line
may be more or less fuzzy).
The naive view
It is a common misconception among
the public (and even among scientists)
that science is a dull subject that
concerns itself solely with the pursuit
of stark-naked facts. Science,
according to this theory, has no room
for subjective feelings, imagination or
creativity. Science is about facts and
facts are objective. All we have to do
is to make the right observations and
we will all agree on what they mean
and on what theory explains them.
Science is but a glorified form of
stamp-collecting.
Anyone, who knows any history
knows that this view is a load of
dingo's kidneys. Science has simply
never been that boring. Great
scientists have (more often than not)
come up with their theories in
moments of inspiration and then spent
years trying to find the experimental
proofs. In other cases the evidence has
sat around being ignored because if
anyone had cared to look then their
theory would have been seen to be
wrong. Einstein and Dirac wanted
their theories to be beautiful (in
mathematicalterms);Kekulefirstsaw
the structure of benzene in a dream
(though the evidence had been staring
him in the face for years); Millikan
deliberately ignored results
suggesting fractional charges on the
electron. Good theories require
inspired scientists, they will not
simply be forced on us by the facts.
Many people seem to be greatly
upset when it is suggested that the
process of scientific discovery is not
completely logical (progressing from
experiments to facts to theories to
truth). A lot of chemists wrote to
Chemical and Engineering News after
an article about Kekule's dream to
complain that such a view of scientific
discovery (that is, scientific advance
relies on intuition and creativity)
undermined the public's faith in
science. If scientific discovery is not
completely logical, then how can we
trust its results?
It is possible to argue that science
is essentially a process involved with
uncovering true facts about the real
world. Indeed, when scientists speak,
they are often regarded as semi-
religious sources of 'the truth about
the world'. However, scientists
actually spend much of their time
disagreeing with each other, and this
would not happen in a world where
truth was always as obvious as some
people want it to be. And there is
another problem: some of the
prevailing scientific views about the
ultimate nature of things actually
challenge any simplistic view of the
concrete nature of reality. Quantum
mechanics imposes fundamental
limits on knowledge, and insists that
even what we do know is so weird
that we don't really understand it.
A critical view of
reality
The big problem with naive realist
views of reality is that they make all
observations equal. Science, if it is to
sort the wheat from the chaff, needs
some way to distinguish between
relevant observations and irrelevant
observations. Unfortunately, any
attempt to make such distinctions
makes science less realist and makes
the truth more distant.
Karl Popper introduced philosophy
of science that puts theories ahead of
observations. In his system the job of
the scientist isfirst to construct good
theories (the theories will suggest
which experiments are necessary) and
then to do the critical experiments.
The theories can come from anywhere
(the subconscious, the logical mind,
an acid trip) and their validity is
independent of their source. Good
science actually needs a constant input
of creative ideas from somewhere.
The quality of a thepry is measured
by its falsifiability. Some people find
this a completely counterintuitive
demand (and many people Completely
misunderstood it). What Popper is
demanding is that there should be, in
principle, some clear experimental
way to prove a theory wrong.
Theories which invoke things that can
never be observed. (for example:
people can only exhibit -psychic,
powers in the presence of befjevers.
and never when sbeptits arepresenfc
or internal combustion engines are
run by little green men who disappear
when you open the bonnet) must-be
treated with some caution. The best
theories are those that are easy to
refute, but have not been refuted: they
have survived the fire of experimental
test.
However, in this view, no theory
is ever absolutely true. The best a
theory can be is not yet refuted.
Science is no longer the search for
truth, but just a search for better
theories. A clear distinction is drawn
between theory and reality. All our
theories are but mental models which
more or less fit the (acts BOW, but
which may well he completely invalid
in the light of tomorrow's
experiments.
Consider the difference between
Newton's theory of gravity and
Einstein's. In certain experiments
they predict very similar results but
in the critical experiments in extreme
conditions (for example the bending
of light under gravity) Einstein wins.
But the basic assumptions of
Newton's model of the world are
What it takes to be a good scientist.
