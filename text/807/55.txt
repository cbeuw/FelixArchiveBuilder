In the nineteen
eighties we have
been bombarded
with scare stories
about the food and
drink we consume.
The American
scientists tell us
that saccarin gives
us cancer while the
French recommend
that half the food
we eat should be in
the form of raw
fruit and
vegetables.
Everything is
carcinogenic
nowadays!
It's hard to know
what we can eat.
The FELIX science
team brings you an
easy-to-read guide
to nutrition
including a special
section on E
numbers.
In the very near future all food
producers will be required by law to
list nutritional information on all
packaging of processed food. This
step has finally been taken following
intensive lobbying of MPs by
dieticians, doctors and medical
committees, who believe that
consumers should be given more
information about what they are
eating. As well as the pressure from
the 'informed' there has also been
pressure from the 'uninformed' who
have heard about additives,
carcinogenes and fibre and want to
understand more in order to live a
healthier life.
The new nutritional details on each
packet will give figures for energy,
protein, carbohydrates, fibre and fat
per lOOg serving (or 100ml in the case
of fluids). Some may even give the
additional information on minerals
and vitamins that the product
contains.

alcohol provides 29 kilojoules and a
pint of beer contains approximately
18g of alcohol.
The energy value of each type of
food will depend on the relative
proportions of protein, carbohydrate,
fat and alcohol.
A person's requirement for energy
will vary depending upon sex, body
size, age, climate, activity, type of job
and metabolic rate. The DHSS
recommends that for an 'ideal' body
weight the average woman should
take 8000 kilojoules a day and the
average man about 10,000 kilojoules
a day.
origin including cereals, fruit,
vegetables, seeds and pulses. Fibre is
contained in the cell walls of plants,
giving structural support to the plant.
The greatest concentration of fibre
is found in the skin of a plant, such
as potato skins and wheat bran.
Fibre values are quite often
depleted when the plant is cooked,
processed or refined which is why
apple sauce contains less fibre than a
fresh apple and apple juice contains
no dietary fibre whatsoever.
Fibre is not digested but aids the
process of digestion. Because it
provides no vital constituents to the
body, fibre was previously
disregarded by dieticians, it has
however become the biword of the
Nineteen Eighties due to research
which has shown that it may play an
important role in the prevention of
'western diseases' such as bowel
cancer, diabetes mellitus, varicose
veins, piles and constipation.
There are two categories of fibre:
soluble and insoluble. Most plants
contain both sorts although
proportions vary depending on the
type of food.
Insoluble fibre is found in cereals
and fibrous vegetables. It is this type
of fibre which assists the passage of
foods through the body. It absorbs
water and acts as a bulking agent in
the stomach. This fibre increases the
rate at which food passes through the
intestines and, at the same time, it
removes any toxic substances from
the body more quickly.
Soluble fibre is present in most fruit
and vegetables.
Beans and lentils are particularly
rich in this type of fibre. Soluble fibre
delays the rate of absorption of
nutrients from food. It does this by
forming a gel which makes the food
travel more slowly through the body.
A major benefit of soluble fibre is
that it delays the uptake of sugar by
the bloodstream which is why
diabetics have to stick to a fibre rich
diet. It maintains a constant blood
sugar level which reduces hunger
pains.
As every good scientist knows,
energy cannot be created nor
destroyed. It can instead be converted
from one form to another. The energy
obtained from our food is used in
several ways: converted to heat to
keep the body temperature constant,
facilitating breathing and pumping
bipod, and replacing blood cells and
body tissues.
The energy value of a food is
worked out by calculating the energy
obtained from the protein,
carbohydrate and fat contents. A
gramme of protein provides 17
kilojoules, a gramme of carbohydrate
provides 16 kilojoules and a gramme
of fat provides 37 kilojoules.
Vitamins and minerals usually
provide negligible energy. Dietary
fibre is not absorbed into the body,
so it also gives no energy. It is
important to remember, if you are
watching your weight, that alcohol
also provides energy. A gramme of

require in our daily diet for growth
and repair of tissue and also for the
maintenance of normal everyday body
functions.
