The fibre in your diet should not be
altered drastically because sudden
changes to your diet can cause
stomach aches, also fibre can have a
laxative effect or cause excessive
flatulence. No need to tell you iust
how antisocial too much fibre can
make you!

Food additives are natural or
artificially produced substances which
may be added to food in small
amounts to perform specific
functions. There are four basic
categories of additives.
• to maintain freshness and give a
longer shelf life.
•to enhance flavour or appearance of
processed food.
• to assist in the processing or
preparation of food.
•to improve nutritional value.
Supermarkets and most consumers
are keen to keep the additives in our
food because there is less spoilage and
more profit if food keeps longer and
looks better. We couldn't keep our
food for as long as we do now if all
additives were removed and more
food would have to be thrown away.
It is also certain that there would be
more cases of food poisoning because
a few types of food can become a
health risk before they either look or
taste off. Ultimately we'd all be
forced to spend a great deal more on
food and be a lot sicker for it. But this
hasn't stopped scientists trying to find
alternative additives to those which
have been shown to be irritants or
carcenogenic.
Some additives are essential for the
creation of products in the form in
which they are known and enjoyed.
It is additives which enhance the
colour^or flavour of food which are
the ones that seem to cause the most
concern. They do, howeVer, make the
food we eat more acceptable to us.
Trials have shown that the majority
of the public will not eat brown tinned
strawberries or khaki-coloured tinned
peas.
Naturally occuring colours or
pigments are very sensitive to light
and heat, particularly in acid foods.
When a manufactured produce is
required to go through a heating
process, the processors will add a
more resistant synthetic dye to keep
the colour.
Sometimes nutrients are added to
supplement your daily requirements
of vitamins and minerals from the
consumption of processed food.
It is a fallacy that additives are all
chemical, artificial, unnecessary and
where possible, to be avoided. There
is, however, an increasing demand for
foods without additives, especially
those believed to cause allergic,
intolerant or hyperactive reactions.
Functions that the additives
perform
Food additives which prevent
spoilage and maintain freshness:
ANTIOXIDANTS
Antioxidants prevent or delay the
rancidity of fats by retarding the
process of oxidation due to oxygen in
the air. Many crude fats and oils
contain antioxidants naturally.
However, these are removed during
the refining process and technologists
need to add natural or artificial
replacements. Antioxidants also
prevent enzymic browning which
causes the discoloration of fruit,
vegetables and fruit juices.
PRESERVATIVES
Preservatives kill micro-organisms
(bacteria, fungi, mould and yeast)
which would otherwise cause food
decay and possibly create health
hazards. They extend the shelf life of
proudcts and some preservatives
protect the natural colour or flavour
of certain foods. In the past, sugar and
salt were used as preservatives, but
for health reasons it is recommended
that sugar and salt in our diet should
be reduced. High sugar and salt foods
must, therefore, be preserved in other
ways.
Additives which assist the
processing or preparation
ACIDS
Acids impart a tart flavour desirable
in some foods. They also assist in the
release of carbon dioxide when
present in raising agents. They have
a preservative effect.
ACID REGULATORS/BUFFERS
Acid regulators/buffers change or
maintian the acidity of alkalinity
levels for desired effect. These
include preservation, added or altered
flavour or tartness, texture
development, colour retention and
assistance in the action of raising
agents.
ANTI-CAKING AGENTS
Anti-caking agents prvent the 'caking'
or lumping of finely powdered or
crystalline substances such as salt,
dried milk and sugar.
BLEACHING AGENTS
Bleacing agents bleach or whiten "tour
and bread.
BULKING AGENTS
Bulking agents add bulk to food
without providing energy (ie
kilocalories) and hence are intended
primarily for 'slimming' foods. They
are not usually digested and,
therefore, act as a course of dietary
fibre, previously termed 'roughage'.
DILUENTS
Diluents dilute of dissolve other
additives, often colours.
EMULSIFIERS
Emulsifiers aid the formation of an
emulsion between two substances
which would not normally mix, such
as oil and water. The emulsifier helps
to disperse tiny droplets of one
substance in a suspension of the other.
For example, milk, mayonnaise and
salad dressings are all oil in water
emulsions, butter and margarine are
water in oil emulsions. The emulsifier
improves consistency and texture.
Another function is to reduce the
quantity of fat required to produce a
desired effect in food. They are often
added to foods which would
otherwise require high levels of fat for
their production, such as ice cream
and cakes.
FIRMING AGENTS
Firming agents prevent food such as
fruit and vegetables from softening
and falling apart in extreme conditions
such as canning or freezing. Hence,
they help to maintain the firm or crisp
nature of the food.
FLOUR IMPROVERS
Flour improvers extend the elastic
properties and aid the development of
dough in bread making. They also
accelerate the bleaching of white flour
by bleaching agents.
FREEZANTS
Freezants extract heat from food
which is consequently frozen by
direct contact.
GLAZING AGENTS
Glazing agents produce a sheen on the
surface of, for example,
confectionary and also provide a
protective coating.
HUMECTANTS
Humecants retain moisture when
incorporated into food preventing it
from rapidly becoming dry due to the
evaporation of the water content.
They are often added to
confectionary.
PROPELLANTS
Propellants are gasses or volatile
liquids used to expel foods from
aerosol container, eg cream.
RAISING AGENTS
Raising agents promote aeration, thus
facilitating a lighter texture and
increased volume when used in baked
products.
RELEASE AGENTS
Release agents prevent foods from
sticking to other surfaces with which
they come in contact during
manufacture or packaging.
STABILISERS
Stabilisers stabilise emulsions,
preventing the two substances from
separating and, as a result, improving
texture and consistency. They are
often present in foods containing
emulsifiers.
THICKENING OR GELLING
AGENTS
Thickening or gelling agents from
gels which modify texture and impart
stability to food. They may be of a
starch or gum nature, However, the
latter are more expensive and,
therefore, less widely used.
Food additives which
enhance the flavour or look
ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS
Artificial sweeteners are sweetening
agents other than sugar, which are
widely used in low calorie products
to aid slimming and, at the same time,
provide a frequently desired sweet
taste.
COLOURS
Colours improve product appearance,
giving colour to otherwise bland or
pale food, restoring the original
colour lost in processing and by
overcoming variations between
different batches, thus satisfying
consumer expectations.
FLAVOURS/FLAVOUR
ENHANCERS
Flavours/flavour enhancers improve
food acceptability when used in minor
quantities. They may restore flavours
lost in processing, supplement bland
food, magnify existing flavours or
enhance the natural flavour.
Concentrated natural flavours are
provided as extracts or essential oils,
whereas flavour enhancers or
modifiers intensify existing flavours
