Crocodile Dundee II
Paul Hogan returns as the loveable
Aussie in what seems to be, from all
accounts, a rather lacklustre follow-
up to the innocently charming, but
vastly overrated original. The film has
'opened to mammoth queues outside
cinema halls in the States. What
amuses me is that the Americans
consistently ignore the fact that they
are being patronised. Linda
Kozlowski returns ad Dundee's love
interest.
(22nd June)
Throw Momma from the Train
At long last they've decided to release
the film which was originally planned'
fiÂ»: release in February. Danny De
Vito (Romancing the Stone, Tin Men)
directs and stars in this parody of all
those Hitchcock classics of the 40s.
He is helped out here by Billy Crystal
(Running Scared)
(24th June)
The setting is the Saigon of 1968. You
may think this is another Vietnam
film, but war-torn Vietnam is just
used as an intriguing backdrop for an
exciting detective thriller made in the
great tradition of Bullitt and The
French Connection. Daniel Dafoe
(Platoon) and Gregory Hines
(Running Scared) star as two
American military cops investigating
a series of murders involving young
Vietnamese prostitutes.
The action comes thick and fast,
and it all makes for a great thriller.

September
September is the sixteenth film written
and directed by Woody Allen and
shows a marked change in style. It is
a deep, dark and quite often
depressing study of the relationship
between a mother (Elaine Stritch) and
her daughter (Mia Farrow). An
impressive cast, including Denhoim
Elliott and Sam Waterston, turn in
good performances, but one thing is
missing from this film and that is
humour, and a Woody Allen film
without humour is just vacuous.
(1st July)
Sign '0' the Times
The spectacular Prince concert comes
to the screen. A must for all Prince
fans and for those who want to see an
excellent concert performance. Prince
may be a pratt, but he also has his
moments of genius.
(1st July)
Police Academy V
Well, I'm sure most of us lost interest
in this series by part II, but they're
still churning them out, to cater for
the abundant American teenage
mentality, which I hope does not exist
here. The regulars are on assignment
in Miami, so expect tanned bods and
drugs, but little substance
(8th July)
The Couch Trip
Dan Aykroyd (Ghostbusters) stars as
an escaped mental patient who
assumes the identity of his psychiatrist
and wreaks havoc on the mad world
outside the asylum. Walter Matthau
co-stars in this over-the-top farce.
Watch out for a cameo by Chevy
Chase as the condom father!
(22nd June)
School Daze
Spike Lee's debut film She's Gotta
Have It won him great critical praise
two years ago. So much so that he
was hailed as the 'black Woody
Allen'. His follow-up is School Daze,
a contemporary comedy musical that
explores the intricacies of black
college life in Atlanta. Lee taps into
his own experiences to give us a story
that balances the issues of race and
class using music and dance.
(29th July)
Light of Day
This feature marks Michael J Fox's
second outing into serious acting,
after Bright Lights, Big City. He has
proved that he can act, but now must
find a good script to highlight his
talent. This is a rather mediocre
affair, with Fox playing a member of
a small time rock band facing family
problems. Co-starring is the rock
singer Joan Jett.
(22nd July)
The Monster Squad
Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolfman and
friends return to present day Earth to
release the forces of evil and destroy
mankind. Our only hope it seems is
a group of kids.
Mindless, but entertaining fun for
those not wishing to expend much
brain-power watching the film
Curiously it carries a 15 certificate
when its target audience must surely
be kids.
(15th July)
Vice Versa
A yuppie and his precocious son
change bodies in this comedy starring
Judge Reinhold (Beverly Hills Cop I
and II) and written by Dick Clement
and Ian Le Franars, who gave us
Porridge, The Likely Lady and Auf
Weidershen, Pet.
