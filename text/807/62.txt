It's been a very successful year for
Imperial College Union Entertainments.
The events have been very well
attended and we've had a turnover of
around Â£20,000.
The Freshers' Week highlights
included Voice of the Beehive who
have since had three top forty singles
and been seen several times on Top of
the Pops. Other bands to visit IC
included Circus Circus Circus, Jim
Jiminee, The Lover Speaks, Howlin'
Wilf & the Veejays, Real Sounds of
Africa, Buddy Curtess & the Jivin'
Instructors, Basil Gabbidon, Yargo,
Blue Ox Babes, Rent Party and Geno
Washington.
Rent Party still remain the best band
we've been entertained by and no
doubt they'll be back at IC next year.
Thanks to everybody who has
attended the gigs this year and good
luck to Paul Watkiss who is Ents
Chairman in 88/89.
John Noble,
Ents Chairman.
