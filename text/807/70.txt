Foodie India
Food and the enjoyment of eating
food, be it in the home or outside, is
the cornerstone of daily existence in
India. The preparation of meals and
snacks always gets a lot of attention.
A typical meal in many parts of India
will include a 'dal', two to three
different vegetable dishes, a meat dish
(if the household are non-
vegetarians), plain yogurt or 'raita',
rice (plain boiled rice or an elaborate
pilau), pickles, salad and 'roti'
(bread). The display of such a spread
emphasises the daily importance of
food to the Indian heart.
Whilst you may or may not get the
chance of being dined in our homes
I hope this article inspires you to
make the most of your gastronomic
enjoyment of a visit to this
magnificent subcontinent.
New Delhi & Old Delhi
Many people fly in to Delhi because
it is a convenient launching pad for
mandatory visits to Jaipur and Agra.
The eating places that I am going
to recommend span the cost spectrum.
Open air eatingjoint opposite Kantal
cinema (near the Ring road in the PK
Puram area of the city)
I will only recommend this place to
people who have acclimatised to
Indian conditions. This place will give
you a damn good flavour of eating out
in Delhi on the cheap. You will be
able to choose from 'boti' keebab,
'seekh' keebab and some specials of
the day. Have 'romali roti' with
whatever you eat. This eaterie is shut
down periodically by the city
authorities because it is an illegal
establishment, but always resurrects
itself.
Roshan's of Karolbagh (This is not
a restaurant)
Once you are in Karalbagh ask
anyone to direct you to 'Roshan ki
kulfi ki dukan' (Rosan's kulfi store).
Kulfi is Indian icecream. At one time
Roshan's was a highly regarded place
to enjoy kulfi, although its name has
deminished recently. You should ask
the other patrons eating there what
they recommend that should be tried
apart from the kulfi.
The famous 'Jalaybees' of Chandni
Chowk
Chandni Chowk is an area in the old
part of the city. The streets are narrow
and thronged with merchants, traders
and full of the hussle-bussle of the
city.
In the middle of one of the choked
streets is a small shop that has made
collosal money making jalaybees,
considered a delicacy in many parts
of India. Ask to be directed to the man
who makes the Chowk's famous pure
ghee jalaybees.
A jalaybee is a hollow coil of batter
that is deep fried in 'ghee' (clarified
butter) until it is very crisp and light
brown. It is then steeped in warm
syrup until the passageways in the coil
become filled. .
The combination of the buttery taste
with the crisp texture of the jalaybee
and the hearty warmth and richness
of the syrup makes me doubt that
manna is the food of the gods.
Karrim's restaurant in Nizzamudeen
You should be able to get the exact
address in the phone directory.
The chefs in this establishment are
directly descended from the chefs to
the Mughal Emperors. One of their
gastronomic creations must be
amongst the culinary wonders of the
world.
The house speciality is the
marinated leg (raan) of goat that is
cooked in a tandoor (clay oven). It is
made according to their secret
methods which most probably
involves the use of green paw-paw to
tenderise the goat meat. The enzymes
within this fruit give the cooked meat
a melt-in-the-mouth tenderness. The
chefs take about an hour to get this
masterpiece to the table.
Well you cannot get a culinary
wonder without a royal price. It will
cost you about 500Rps, which is
between one to two week's salary of
a starting engineer in India, although
in sterling it might not look that
outrageous.
One consolation is that there is
enough meat on the leg to last three
hungry men without any side dishes.
The Deep South
Tamil Nadu will be a haven foi the
vegetarian traveller. Tdilli* and
'dosas' feature strongly. Willi is a
steamed ground rice cake which is
eaten accompanied by 'sambar'.
'Sambar' has a distinct spicy taste
which is produced by patiently
grinding coconut, chillis and other
ingredients into a paste before it is
fried together with some vegetables
and water to produce its earthy south
Indian taste.
The landmarks in the cuisine of the
South are:
1) Plain dosa (made from rice and
chickpea flour) eaten with sambar.
2) Masala dosa. This is akin to a
plain dosa, but is rolled and stuffed
with spicy potato filling. It is served
with samabar and a coconut chutney,
but its taste is best brought out if it
is enjoyed with the chutney alone.
3) 'Rava dosa', a lacey plain dosa
which has onions added to it. It can
be eaten accompanied with samabar
and some coconut chutney.
4) Tdilli' or 'rava idilli', eaten with
sambar.
5) 'Uttapam' (made from rice and
chickpea flour). It is eaten with spiced
chickpeas.
Non-vegetarians are recommended to
try the chicken dishes, especially the
chicken korma.
The Shri Ram Krishna lunch home
(Subhas Chandra Bhose Road,
Madras), has been tipped.
Hyderbad (Andhra Pardesh)
One cannot visit the bastions of
Muslim India and not try a goat
biryani. This city was legendary for
its excellent biryanis and in my books
it still is.
A genuine biryani is difficult to
make. The rice must be cooked
together with the spiced meat pieces
long enough so that each grain oozes
out the aroma of saffron and the
cooked meat. The aroma of a first
class biryani should be so
overwhelming that you should be able
to smell it as soon as it leaves the
kitchen.
I suggest that you ask the city locals
to recommend a place where a good
biryani could be sampled. I was
fortunate to be treated to a lunch at
the Ritz Hotel in Hyderabad where
the chef had mastered this dish.
Gujrat State
In many parts of India most food
establishments offer a 'thali' which is
a set meal which included portions of
the specials of the day served with
rice, some 'roti' or 'purres' and
pickles. The thali is an economical
way of eating good food in India.
Gujrati food is famous for its
snacks. Get someone to recommend
you a place where you can enjoy
'bhajieas' (deep fried vegetables
coated in a chickpea flour batter) and
'dhokra' (a grainy cake made from
ground chickpeas and rice and
spices).
Special Points
No visit to this subcontinent is
complete without trying a 'paan'.
I will recommend that first timers
try a 'meeta (sweet) paan'. A paan is
made by coating a paan leaf with lime
extract and packing it with beetle
nuts, fennel seeds, peppermint extract
and other aromatic substances. The
rolled leaf is meant to be slowly
chewed and only the aromatic juices
produced are swallowed. After a
while you might like to spit out any
fibrous material that is left. Hardened
'paan' addicts eat dozens of these
things a day.
No fruit has inspired the Indian
mind more than mangoes. Its taste has
stirred many people to write poetry
about it. There are dozens of different
types of mangoes—chosa, langras,
alfonsos. Each type has a different
colour, texture, taste and aroma.
Enjoy the mangoes if you are there
in the mango season. Get someone to
tell you about the different types of
mangoes and try them all.
Bon Voyage & Bon Apetit
Take it easy on the stomach for the
first five days of arriving in India.
Wash your fruit before eating it and
generally take care otherwise
Montesuma's revenge will strike you.
I would like to thank Rashmi,
Raghunathan and Hitesh for expert
advice. It was not possible to mention
everything I would have like to
include.
Bye, Yishu.
