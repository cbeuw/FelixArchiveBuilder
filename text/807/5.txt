Imperial College Union Sportshop
will be refurbished over the Summer
with a new shop front which will
overlook the walkway. The move
which marks the culmination of three
years of negotiations has been delayed
by changes of staff in the estates office
and by the departure of Deputy
President Alan Rose.
DP unwaged
Imperial College Union Deputy
President Alan Rose has had his
salary stopped by the Union Finance
Committee. Following a motion
proposed by President Sydney
Harbour Bridge (name changed in aid
of Comic Relief), it was decided that
the £600 left in the salaries account
from this move would be used to fund
the UROP project looking into the
recycling of paper.
Guard mobbed
A security guard was assaulted by
three black youths last Wednesday.
The guard was set upon when asked
one of the youths not to remove a
glass from Southside Bar. The guard
was kicked several times before the
youths ran off.
Southside cuts
Two girls were injured in an accident
in Southside Bar on Friday. The girls,
both Mineral Resource Engineering
students, were cut when a glass was
broken whilst they were pouring beer
over each other during a post
examination celebration. They were
taken to St Stephen's Hospital where
one girl was given four stitches in the
elbow and the other two stitches in the
hand.
ULU korfball
The University of London will be
staging an international Korfball
tournament on Sunday. Fifty-six
teams will be entering from Belgium,
Holland, Germany and Britain. A
spokeswoman from the U L U team
said they were looking forward to
competing with players of
international standard. The team will
be holding a pretournament disco in
IC's Union Lounge on Saturday at
8.30pm. Anyone is welcome to
attend.
Southside residents were evacuated on
Friday when fumes from roasting
meat set off the smoke detectors in
Mustapha's Kebab shop. The incident
occured when the shop's staff forgot
to turn on the extraction fans above
the kebab oven. Similar false alarms
have occured since the Kebab shop
opened at the beginning of this term.
Assistant Safety Director Ian Gillett
told FELIX that the smoke detectors
next to the oven had been replaced
with heat detectors in an attempt to
solve the problem. He explained that
kebab fumes were still able to reach
the remaining smoke detector when
Clementine, the Mines Motorised
Mascot is back on the road for the
first time in twelve years. Clem, a
1926 Morris Commercial Lorry
received its MOT last Monday.
'It was decided in February to have
Clem legal by the end of the College
Year', said Clem's driver Stephen
Laing.
the extractor fans were not switched
on. He added that a mechanism for
turning the fans on automatically and
the possibility of linking the extractor
fans to a time switch were under
consideration.
When FELIX contacted Refectory
Manager Rob Northey on Monday he
claimed that the false alarms were
caused by faulty equipment rather
than a lack of ventilation. This is
denied by the College Security service
and by the company which installed
the system, Fire Alarm Clock
Engineering Limited (FACE).
Clem is due to be repainted in the
Mines Colours, black, yellow and
white. It is hoped that she will be able
to accompany City and Guilds
mascot, Bo, on the London to
Brighton run and the Royal College
of Science's mascot Jezebel to the
Commercial Motor Vehicle Rally.
Mr Laing expressed particular
Two of the staff in 'Mustapha's'
kebab bar in Southside have been
sacked for alleged 'financial
misappropriation'. The two staff
concerned have been accused of
serving free food and drinks to
colleagues working in Southside
refectory.
The workers were dismissed at 5pm
on Wednesday evening but the bar
will remain open for the rest of the
week. Kebabs will not be on sale over
Summer, however.
The banned refectory worker Mr R
Dick .on told FELIX that he had not
accepted free drinks and that he would
be taking the matter to the NUPE
Trade Union.
