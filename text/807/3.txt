FELIX
Welcome to the last issue of F E L I X this
academic year. You'll find this one
slightly larger than you're used to, but
we did warn you that this one would be
a bit special.
With a stunning 84 pages, you should
find at least one or two features worth
reading.
I would particularly recommend that
you read the Rector's article on the
future of Imperial College and Union
Manager David Peacock's feature on
his ideas for Imperial College Union.
Another section well-worth glancing
at are the interviews of Union President
Sydney Harbour Bridge and Deputy
President Alan Rose. They are very
different perspectives of the past twelve
months in the Union and go some way
to indicate why there was a personality
clash between the two of them.
Our features section is very extensive
this week, covering such diverse
subjects as suicide, cults, the history of
British radio and dreams.
On a more global frame, F E L I X has
sent our Chief Political Correspondent
A n d r e w W a l l e r to interview
Westminster M P and Chairman of the
Conservative Party Peter Brooke. It's
a must if you're interested in local and
central politics. Also External Affairs
Officer Neil Motteram states his
opinions about the Great Education
Reform Bill and its effects on IC
students.
We have our share of light-hearted
pieces scattered throughout the issue.
As well as our legendary F E L I X news
review of the year, there's the last
Baron, specially reincarnated for the
final issue.
I hope that you enjoy reading this
issue and that you all have a great
Summer. May your degrees be good
ones and for the rest of you, whom I
will be joining once again as a student,
see you all next year.
