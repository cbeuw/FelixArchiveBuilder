interviewed for FELIX by Bill Goodwin
Have you enjoyed your year as
President?
Yes. I'd do it again any day. At the
start of the year I didn't know quite
how much I could achieve and at the
end of it I feel I have achieved a
satisfactory amount. The last term has
been quite disappointing from that
point of view, because we have been
trying to hold the Union together
rather than develop it.
What do you think your most
significant achievement has been?
Probably the reorganisation of the
Student Union. The new structure is
going to mean a lot in the future. The
instigation of the Hon Sec (Events)
could aid social life at the College and
develop the Union from the students'
point of view. It's something we have
needed for a long time.
Could you tell me about the liaison
committee which has been set up
betÂ«ten the Union and Industry ?
This is something we're still looking
into. But what I have envisaged, and
in discussions with the Industrial
Society and the Careers Service, we
have come up with a formula which
works a bit like this; the Industrial
Relations Sub-Committee goes out
and organises a number of events
related to industry to bring in some
income from them for their support
of those events and at the same time
help students find jobs through
advertising and promotions within
College. We hope to produce a
booklet of student activities that we
can senci out to industry, showing
them that we are interested in industry
and showing them how they can help
Last year the Union was involved
J in a number of student welfare
campaigns, for example the
campaign on Aids and Human
Rights week. Why do you think the
Union has been less active on this
front this year?
I think that's directly my fault. It's a
specific part of my job. Christine Oast
year's president) concentrated on
those things very heavily. I
concentrated this year on setting up
a system so that people would be able
to have enough time free to be able
to do that to the extent that I could
never have achieved it and to a far
fuller extent than Christine could have
achieved it. I must admit whole-
heartedly that my activity in welfare
has not been good this year, which is
sad for me because I really do believe
in student welfare.
How does the Union plan to invest
the three million pounds from
Harlington Gravel?
My God, you hit on something there!
I doubt that the money will be
invested. The plan at the moment is
to spend the money on a new sports
hall. The sad thing about the sports
hall is that it is desperately needed.
It could provide a very good facility
for the students here on campus, but
the amount of income it will bring in
to support the fund is very limited.
There are a number of other projects
which are in the pipeline which are
more luxury facilities than necessity
facilities, but at the same time they
could generate a quantity of income
to support the system. One of them
is an astroturf sports pitch which can
be used for tennis, football training
or hockey. There's the possibility of
a bowling alley. That would bring
money in in many different ways.
Feasibility studies on it show it to be
profitable, with a five year pay-off
period and the ability to keep prices
low for students. The other major
7 did it

thing that the money from Harlington
could be used for is a sports manager;
someone who would coordinate the
use of the facilities we have plus
coaching for clubs and societies. The
further possibility is a leisure centre
with Jacuzzis and saunas and that sort
of thing. The feasibility study has yet
to be carried out but it looks
promising.
Do you think the Union has done
enough to fight the forthcoming
increases in accommodation
charges?
The Union has been very active in
attempting to help the Residence
account sustain itself and continue to
run. The situation is that there are two
blocks of College which cannot
operate on a University Grants
Committee funding. All the rest of
College gets money from the UGC.
The two blocks are the refectories and
the halls of residence. They have to
be independently self-financing,
which means that if we purchase
accommodation, we have tofindthe
money to pay for it. Now,
accommodation and housing costs in
London are extremely high, and there
is no way that we can purchase new
accommodation without increasing
the rents across the whole system.
This is why I was so opposed to the
purchase of Fisher Hall at all last
year, because-I knew it would cause
a dramatic increase in rents. Christine
Taig tied our hands to that last year
and there was very little I could do
about it. The only way we can
actually sort the system out is to make
the Conference Office capable of
bringing in more money from outside
letting, and that may mean a
reorganisation. Unless we can get
more money in, the residence system
is going to continue to find itself in
more and more difficult positions.
Which of the College
administrators do you admire the
most, and why?
John Smith, the College Secretary.
Because when you go to him and you
suggest something to him, he sees you
at short notice, he listens to what you
have to say. If he likes it, he tells you
he likes it; if he doesn't like it, he tells
you he doesn't like it. You know
where you stand. If he likes it he gives
you his support, and you get it done.
If he doesn't like it then you know you
have to try and find some way to get
round the bugger. But you know
where you stand with him. He's a
clever man.
You've recently been elected
Chairman of Publications Board.
What are your plans for next year?
I'm very keen to start kicking a few
of the publications into shape, mainly
the electronic ones that need a lot of
encouragement to kick-start them
onto the way to real expansion. I think
input from outside organisations can
really help those two specific media
and I think if those two could actually
be expanded and improved we could
see a great development in them.
As far as the publications such as
FELIX and the Handbook are
concerned, I think I can add a lot
more on the side of gaining more
sponsorship and advertisement in
some of those areas. I don't want
really to have anything to do with the
ideals of what goes in them and what
doesn't go in them. But I would like
to help them get going and get more
money coming in for them and
supporting them better.
How do you intend to help the
publications gain more ?
I think a more direct link between
Imperial College Union and industry
through such things as the Industrial
