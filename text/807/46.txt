Bed is a pleasurable
place or a hellish
nightmare where
you toss and turn,
battering your
pillow into new,
sleep-inducing
forms as the clock
ticks ever on.
Dreams have
always been
considered to be
the tools of
prophecy since
prehistoric times.
The bible tells us
of Joseph who
dreamt of the Sun
T> ;re are two popular theories about
dr
eams and why we have them. The
first school believes that they are the
way that the brain disposes of
unwanted information which has been
clogging it up. The second school
oetieves that they simply provide
harmless entertainment for the
dormant brain. It is generally
accepted by both schools that dreams
do not occur in microseconds as
nineteenth century textbooks
speculated, but take 'normal' time to
run their courses.
Research has also shown that
external factors can enter into our
dreams. If a telephone rings in the
bedroom, the subconscious can build
it into a telephone call in the dream.
Some people can even experience
Jucid dreams where the dreamer slips
in and out of the subconscious and
semiconsciousness while
incorporating rational ideas into the
dream, making the dream take the
course the dreamer wishes it to take.
Many artists and poets claim that their
dreams have been their inspiration for
their greatest works.
Freud was very keen on
interpreting other people's dreams as
part of his psychoanalysis
programme. In his book
'Interpretation of Dreams' he
revealed how many dreams have an
erotic meaning. Here are a few
common dream themes and Freud's
interpretation of them:
Swimming or drowning—Freud
claimed that any dream containing
water was very sensual—swimming
was in fact the sex act and drowning
was a yearning for sex.
Being chased or being stuck to one
spot—both of these images are
symbolic of the conflict of desire and
danger. They symbolise trying to
escape from something they secretly
desire.
Riding—sex again!
Guns and knives—these symbolise
masculine sexuality. Freud claimed
that they were both phallic symbols.
The House—the house symbolises the
human body. If you dream of doing
housework it is, in fact, revealing
your insecurities about your body "
your relationships. If you dream abo
the external appearance of the house,
it is revealing your insecurities about
your looks and the way people
perceive you. Similarly doors
represent openings in the body and
corridors symbolise a desire to return
to the womb. Locks and keys in locks
are sex again!
Flying—it is quite a common dream
to imagine yourself flying under your
own arm and leg power, as if
swimming through thin air. This type
of dream can be interpreted in two
different ways depending on your
circumstances. The first is a thirst for
power; the second is a need to escape.
Falling—expresses insecurity and
anxiety about the future. It is often
dreamt by people when their
relationship with another person is
coming to an end.
Naked—is interpreted as either
having an inferiority complex or
having a desire to be a different sort
of person.
Fire—this is a very passionate sort of
dream and warns of the dangers that
go with desire.
Castle—symbolise strength and
power and is often dreamt about by
men who are continuing relationships
with strong women.
Mountains—are interpreted to mean
that the dreamer is worried about
many problems which have to be
overcome.

Dreams have
intrigued us ever
since. Nobody
knows what dreams
mean or why they
occur. The only
certain thing is that
we only remember
them if we wake up
during or directly
after having one.
Many of us have experienced
insomnia at some time in our lives.
The most common causes of
temporary insomnia in students are
exam worries, excessive drinking or
excessive eating. The insomnia
usually lasts one or two days whilst
the brain turns over problems or
solutions to problems, tries to get over
the alcohol invasion or allows the
body to cope with the indigestion.
However, some adults suffer
continued insomnia for months, or
even years at a time. Initially the
sleeplessness was caused by simple
problems but then the insomnia
became the problem and it fuelled
itself.
Experiments on volunteer students
at Loughborough University by Dr
Jim Home have shown that the
average student only needs six and a
half hours sleep each night. He
believes that people have been conned
into believing that they need the full
eight hours every night. He says that
most insomnia is perceived rather
than actual.
There are conflicting views on
sleeping pills. 'Vallium's fine if you
take it when you need it say once
every three days, but if you abuse it,
you become dependent, you can't
sleep properly without it.'
There are several natural methods
to overcome sleeplessness.
Homeopaths strongly recommend a
camomile tea to help you unwind,
whereas acupuncturists can help you
to learn muscle relaxation techniques.
Some more radical doctors
recommend that you should only ever
sleep in your bedroom. Everything
else should take place in other parts
of the house. But what if you are a
humble student and live in a bed-sit?
Dr Home has spent most of his life
studying sleep patterns. He has firm
ideas about sleep and dreams. He
claims that it is only the brain which
needs sleep and that the rest of the
body can be without it if it gets the
necessary rest and food.
There are several cycles to the sleep
pattern. Every person has their own
individual pattern. We can generalise
by saying that the first two-thirds of
sleep period consists of both deep and
light sleep and the last third consists
only of light sleep. Each cycle ends
with a period of Rapid Eye Movement
where most of the dreaming occurs
and the average student's cycle lasts
about 90 minutes.
Dr Home believes that deep sleep
restores the brain, and in particular,
the upper part of the brain, the rest
obtained also revitalises the body.
The Prime Minister Mrs Margaret
Thatcher goes with just four hours of
sleep a night. Dr Home says that this
isn't turning the PM slowly mad; she
is just missing out on the light sleep.
People who naturally sleep shorter
hours have the same amount of deep
sleep but less light sleep than those
that get their full eight hours.
Whatever can be said about sleep,
when it comes and is uninterrupted
for six or so hours, it is one of the
most enjoyable experiences on this
earth!
