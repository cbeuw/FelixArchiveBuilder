Edinburgh Fringe
Summer is obviously a time to watch
and partake in sport but there are
many other past-times which are
ideally suited for this time of year.
If you have a few weeks to spare
during August, why not pop up to
Edinburgh for the Festival? Imperial
College Union's Dramatic Society,
under the name Theatre West End, is
running a Fringe venue on Princes
Proms
August and September are Proms
months. You are best advised to get
an official programme from any good
newagent and carefully plan your
Summer around your favourite
concerts. The tickets are dirt cheap
if you're prepared to squat in the
arena of the Royal Albert Hall and
queue for a few hours beforehand.
If you go to several concerts in the
season you can qualify for a ticket to
the Last Night. It's all good fun if you
like that jingoistic stuff.
US1C
Music venues are enjoying something
of a renaissance at the moment. Bands
don't usually play during August and
September but this year there is some
real talent doing the circuit.
The Men They Couldn't Hang are
playing the Mean Fiddler on July 5th.
I've been told that they're an excellent
live band, but if you're going you
must wear steel-toecapped shoes!
Also at the Mean Fiddler but from
13th-15th July, Mary Coughlan is
showcasing her latest album. You can
find out more details about both these
gigs from the venue on 01-961 5490.
10,000 Maniacs are visiting the
Town and Country Club on August
1st. They're charging £ 6 . 5 0 per
ticket, whereas Ozzy Osbourne, also
at the T&C Club on July 13th-14th,
is asking £ 8 . 5 0 .
Street for the whole period. The
actual Fringe Festival has become so
commercialised over the last few
years that there have been calls for a
'Fringe-Fringe' Festival.
Theatre West End usually has some
really good (as well as some really
naff) plays and revues on over the
three weeks of the Fringe. DramSoc
will be performing three plays this
year. If you can only spare a long
weekend, the best time is between
Weeks Two and Three so you can
take in all the IC shows.
Edinburgh gets incredibly crowded
for these three weeks, so don't bother
going on the spur of the moment
because you'll never find any
accommodation once you get up
there.
If you are chained to Imperial
during August, you will probably get
the opportunity to see at least one of
the three Edinburgh plays performed
sometime at the beginning of the
Autumn Term.
Cabaret
Cabaret can be found throughout
London. The best place is the
Comedy Store on the Leicester
Square where they're currently
featuring some act called Felix! Local
venues include the Duke Of Clarence
at 203 Holland Park Avenue and the
Kensington Tavern at 54 Russell
Square Gardens. Quality cabaret acts
can be found most nights.
