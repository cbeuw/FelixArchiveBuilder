Tfte Wimbledon All-England Tennis
Championships run through until 3rd
Julx this year.
The College is
beginning to drain
of life as exam
time draws to a
close. Some of us
- will spend the
Summer at our
industrial sponsors,
whereas others will
see a bit more of
the world. The
unlucky few have
to remain in
London, either to
pursue PhDs or
clean our halls of
residence.
Sport
There's still a great deal happening
in London over the Summer. The
tennis championships at Wimbledon
go on for the next two weeks. If you
turn up early and queue you can get
some really cheap seats but don't
forget the strawberries and cream!
The favourite for the Men's title is
Ivan Lendl at 11-4. Last year's winner
Pat Cash (who incidently beat Lendl
in the final) is 7-2 and Boris Becker,
the 1986 winner, is 10-3.
Wimbledon will be well televised
by the BBC, as will the Olympics
from Korea. IC man Geoff Parsons
should be there as Britain's best high
jumper, giving you the opportunity to
point at the television and proclaim
loudly T go to college with that man!'
It doesn't look as if British football
teams will be let back into Europe
following the violence in West
Germany last week. It's a great pity,
especially for Wimbledon FC who
won the FA Cup this year and would
have gone to Europe for the first time
in their history.
Carnival Theatre
If the police give the go-ahead, the
Notting Hill Carnival will take place
over the Bank Holiday period right at
the end of August. If you don't mind
crowds, heat, muggings and knife
attacks then the Carnival is a really
groovy place to go. The excitement
takes place from 1 lam till late on both
the Sunday and Monday. The floats
start off at Ladbrooke Grove and are
pursued through the streets of North
Central London to the sounds of the
Caribbean and the smell of rice and
peas.
There is plenty of good theatre on at
the moment. If you fancy watching
some good Shakespeare, then you
can't do better than go to the Barbican
and watch the RSC perform Julius
Caesar. You can pick up a ticket for
just Â£6 if you've got your Union card
at hand.
The West End theatres aren't very
adventurous at the moment. You can
still catch Les Miserables or The
Phantom of the Opera, if you don't
mind vying with all those American
tourists. Alternatively, you can seek
out the Fringe London theatres such
as the Almeida in Islington, The Man
in the Moon on the Kings Road or the
Lyric in Hammersmith, currently
showing Facades starring Frances De
La Tour.
