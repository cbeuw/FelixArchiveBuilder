I was approached
by a young woman
with a clipboard the
other day. I'd seen
similar young
people hovering
around the subway
entrance in
Exhibition Road but
had always
managed to avoid
being stopped by
them. She was very
insistent when I
said that I didn't
have the time to
stop and talk to
her. I agreed to
answer a few
questions. They
were all reasonably
simple, until the
final set. Did I
believe there was a
god? Why not?
What is your idea
of an ideal world?
Do you think that it
can be achieved?
Would I like to
come for a free
meal and talk one
night this week?—
Eh, no thanks, I'm
very busy this
week.
After a year at IC, it's a safe bet that
you've been approached at least once
by someone offering you peace,
friendship and enlightenment. They
ask you a few questions, invite you
around to their place for a meal, show
you a video and insist that you spend
a weekend with them in a country
house with a few friends.
Few people set out to join a cult and
yet there are millions of people all
over the world who have devoted
themselves to these new religions. It's
a mistake to believe that it is the
emotionally or intellectually crippled
who are particularly vulnerable.
Everyone suffers from depression at
some time in their life. It is so easy
to become overwhelmed because of
stresses created by exam pressures,
broken relationships, loneliness and
social group pressures. Cults promise
simple solutions to complex
problems. Their doctrines deal with
intellectual doubts and emotional
uncertainties, offering potential
recruits a new security to their lives.

The most popular method used in
London today are the questionnaires
or personality tests. One such cult are
The Scientologists, whose
headquarters are on Tottenham Court
Road.
Although outlawed in many
European countries, the 'free
personality test' is still in evidence in
London. Pedestrians in central
London are asked to come off the
street to answer around 200 questions
to reveal their true personality.
Strangely enough, almost everybody
who takes these tests is found to have
a personality deficiency. They are
given pamphlets to read, offering a
variety of expensive courses which
can 'enrich' your life.
Another popular way of recruiting
is by backing a 'respectable'
organisation. Narconon, a drug
rehabilitation unit, is also run by The
Scientologists and has been much
criticised for the way it replaces drug
dependence with cult dependence.
The EST (Erhard Seminar
Training) is behind The Hunger
Project, whose aim is to stop world
hunger by the year 2000. The
charity's links with the cult are not
widely known as the EST philosophy
contradicts that of THP. EST state:
'We are How, What, and Where we
are because that is what we chose.
There is no need to aid the sick and
the poor because they want to be what
they are.' It has been alleged recently
that most money has been channelled
back into creating more publicity.

The Cult Information Centre have
recently published a leaflet called
Cults on Campus. Its emphasis is very
much on avoiding being recruitt in
the first place:
c u
• QUESTION people with easy
answers to world problems.
• QUESTION people who are
excessively friendly, as there are few
instant friendships.
• QUESTION people with invitations
to free meals and lectures, where the
objectives are not clearly stated-
there may be a hidden agenda.
• QUESTION people that pressure
you because 'everyone else is doing
it'.
•QUESTION people that recruit you
through guilt-induced by others, it is
rarely a productive emotion.
• QUESTION invitations to seminars
or free weekends in the country.
CIC are very quick to point out that
recruiters are not con artists—'they
are believers, which is what makes
them so convincing.'

Helen was a student a
t Aston
University. She was intelligent but
admits to being idealistic and
spiritually curious. She was offered
a weekend in the country to help her
stop smoking. She didn't know what
to expect of the weekend and saw it
as a bit of fun with a suitable goal.
When she got to the house she met
a lot of friendly people who were all
keen to discuss 'life, the universe, and
everything'. 'We all went around
hugging and kissing each other and
talking about the ideal world.'
The intensive stop-smoking course
began. 'They took our watches away,
gave us long lectures which came to
no conclusion, wouldn't let us go to
sleep, shouted at us and made us feel
guilty about ourselves. Not just
because we were smokers, but
because we didn't share their beliefs.'
'After what seemed like days, but
was only just over 24 hours, they fed
us and gave us our possessions back.
It was all hugging and kissing again.
I felt really cleansed.'
Helen's story is so similar to many
students'. She was approached soon
after she had moved away from
home. T felt good after the weekend.
I felt part of something, like I'd really
achieved soemthing and met a lot of
lovely people.'

The Scientologists was founded in
1951 by L Ron Hubbard, the science
fiction writer. They claim to have a
worldwide membership of 6 million.
Their doctrine is 'dianetics', a type
of psycho-analysis which offers
members 'total freedom'. It appeals
to people who are keen to improve
themselves and claims that members
will lose all their mental burdens.
The Scientologist's goal is to make
the whole planet 'clear, creating a
Utopia full of happy, fulfilled people.'
They carry out their recruitment in
Tottenham Court Road, inviting
passers-by to fill in personality
questionnaires. These reveal a need
for counselling and people are
persuaded to attend expensive
courses. New members are asked to
invest in their courses. When they
can't pay, they join the staff to work
off their debt. Some even sign
contracts which commit themselves to
work for the cult forever. Every
member has to recruit a new member
and detect his personal problems
