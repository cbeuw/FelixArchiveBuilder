SPIRIT OF ERASMUS LIVES ON AT IMPERIAL
UNKNOWN ACADEMICS
MEET IN IC DEPARTMENT
I o be or not be, as posed so many years
(ago by William Shakespeare, is a question
I never far from the mind of Professor A
' Random. For Professor Random, holder of
the Swivel Chair in Biological Oil Resources
Engineering, is charged with coordinating the
liaison between IC and Industrial Products Limited
of Thorpe-le-Soken.
For a reason not entirely certain, Professor
Random met last week with unknown Soviet
Astrophysicist Vladimir Teleskoposki in his
department. This historic meeting was a world first
for Mr Teleskoposki, who has never met the
Professor before. In celebration of the event, the
Department cracked open a bottle of milk so that
the academics could have tea.
Having got rid of Teleskoposki, Professor
Random showed me round his unique Liaison Unit.
The Unit is currently studying a new microbe which
could end the World's cotton wool crisis overnight.
However, the project is making only slow progress
as the required microbe has not yet been caught.
'It certainly is a tricky little critter,' said the
Professor, as he described how he and his assistants
had been chasing the organism round the
laboratory.
In a comment worthy of the great Erasmus
himself, Professor Random remarked 'At the end of
the day it's all over bar the shoutingâ€”and why not?
You can't say fairer than that.' The Professor has
been awarded a SERC grant of SI35,000 for his
work, hut he feels he can double this by sub-letting
his laboratory while he is on holiday in the
Bahamas. 'What can you get for SI35,00 these days,
anyway?' he asked.
'Imperial College is, of course, an institution
dedicated to the study of Science and Technology,'
he said, 'and as such is entirely suited to be the site
of the Liaison Unit. In fact, were this the School of
Oriental and African Studies, 1 would be somewhat
stuck, all things considered.'
Professor Random went on to recount an
interesting incident which occurred during a lecture
he was delivering on the bone structure of the
Honduran tree r-at...(continued on page 173).
RECTOR WANTS
MORE WOMEN IN
FUTURE
he Rector yesterday welcomed the
increase in the number of women studying
at Imperial. This year's intake is 178% up
on last year's for undergraduate students,
52 for postgraduates.
Professor Ash said this was a significant
contribution to the advancement of Science and
Technology, and added that he feit it was, in
general, a good thing.
