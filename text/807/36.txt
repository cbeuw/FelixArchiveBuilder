example, if a horse runs a blinder on
good going, then it might not be
suited to running a simliar race when
it has been raining the night before
and the going is soft. Something else
that frequently occurs is that a nag
which has previously been entered for
a mile long race is stepped down to
seven furlongs for its next outing.
All these factors have to be taken
into account.
The information given in this article
is only intended as a brief summary
of racing and betting. The best way
to learn more about the
sport/hobby/occupation is to actually
start following the form. An easy
enough way to start is by betting on
certain horses on paper or by placing
very small bets initially. Once you
become proficient at laying bets, then
the value of the bet can be stepped up.
The important thing to remember
is that you cannot win a sizable chunk
ofdosh by merely picking names out
of a hat or by laying small amounts.
The only way to succeed in the racing
world of racing is to bet well and win
well. Unfortunately, there are a lot of
people about who think they have
devised 'foolproof methods of
winning. They are sadly mistaken. If
you don't want to get your fingers
burnt, then don't jump in the fire in
the first place. Happy betting....
