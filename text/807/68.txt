Coming to America
It looks like Eddie Murphy will have
another huge hit with this comedy
which he wrote himself. In it he play s
the prince of a mythical African
kingdom who travels to New York in
search of a bride. The film re-unites
Eddie Murphy with director John
Landis, after Trading Places, and co-
stars James Earl Jones. Later in the
year Murphy makes his dramatic
debut in Fences.

Switching Channels
The plot sounds familiar—a love
triangle develops between three
players in the game of Network TV
news. We've seen it before in
Broadcast News, which was
excellent, and so this film is at an
immediate disadvantage in that it
lacks originality of subject matter and
has a lot to live up to. I'm sure that
this film will be nowhere near as good
as Broadcast News, but it does boast
Kathleen Turner, Burt Reynolds and
Christopher Reeve.

Timothy Dalton takes a break from
his Bond duties to exercise his
comedic and acting skills in this
British film about two terminally ill
patients^Dalton and Anthony
Edwards (Top Gun)—who decide that
if they have to die, they might as well
die with smiles on their faces, and so
they steal an ambulance and head for
the brothels of Amsterdam. Their
ensuing adventures are marked with
a serious message concerning the
terminally ill.

Rambo III
Rambo III begins with Rambo living
in a Buddhist monastery in Thailand,
where he has gone to find inner peace.
One wonders whether this is supposed
to be a comedy. But then it's life back
to normal with Sylvester Stallone (still
fighting his personal battle with the
Ruskies) going into Afghanistan to
save his captive colonel friend
(Richard Crenna) from those evil
commies. I wonder how many
thousands of Russian soldiers he'll
blow away in the attempt.

The Running Man
Arnold Schwarzenegger is back to
delight us with his acting skills in this
action-packed futuristic thriller, based
on a Stephen King Story. He plays a
game-show contestant, but the object
of the game is to stay alive. It may
be silly but it should be great

Rattle and Hum
No release date has been set yet for
this long-awaited U2 concert film.
The probable time of release is
September or, appropriately,
October. A live double album will
follow.
Beetlejuice
American comedian Michael Keaton
was badly in need of a hit film, and
found it in this screwball comedy
which did very well in the states.
(19th August)
Good Morning Vietnam
Not another Vietnam film, you may
be saying, but this one is different.
It's a well made comedy based on a
true story and stars Robin Williams
who was nominated for an oscar for
his performance as a DJ on the local
Armed Forces Radio Network in
Vietnam. The film was an enormous
hit in the States, and should do well
here. At last we have a film that
makes full use of Robin William's
considerable talent.

Frantic
Harrison Ford doesn't make many
films these days, but what he does is
always really good. So it is worth
looking forward to this thriller set in
Paris and directed by Roman
Polanski.
(5th September)
Stars and Bars
This is a tale of two cultures with
Daniel Day Lewis (Unbearable
Lightness of Being) as a young
English art expert who is sent to
Georgia to convince the owner of a
long-lost Renoir to sell it to him. The
humourous encounter pits upper-class
British culture with the wiles of the
deep South.
(16th September)
No Man's Land
In America, a car is stolen every 29
seconds, mostly by professional car
thieves. In No Man's Land Charlie
Sheen plays the villanous head of a
large auto theft ring, with D B
Sweeney as an undercover cop
seeking to convict Sheen, but
eventually being seduced by the easy
money, exotic nightlife and seductive
danger of the criminal world.
