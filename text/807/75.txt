Minister's son in
sordid school
scandal shock
Dear Sir/Madam/To whom it may cottcern,
I understand that a certain Andrew Bernard Thompson
has been spreading vicious libel about the secondary school
antics of a certain Neil Motteram. I'm sure that as a good
Baptist Minister, Andrew's father didn't bring him up to
tell fibs, and so saying that Neil stood up in an English
class and shaved off all his pubic hair is obviously just
a slip of Andrew's memory. Neil, in fact, never did
anything so exciting in the second year,firstyear, or even
at primary school—and I was in the same class to him
between the ages of eight and twelve, so I can purport
to be a reasonably good authority on the subject.

Ed's note: I think that it's come to the time when I must
formally apologise on behalf of Delator for the things
written about Neil Motteram in the Blackmail column
this year. Mr Thompson tells me that the story we ran
was 'based on truth'. However, Mr Motteram has
revealed that he removed his underpants in a lesson
at school using Mr Thompson's scissors because they
were 'painful'. Once again, sorry for all the
embarrassment that was caused, but at least we're
friends again!
Misguided
charity
To the Editor,
With regard to the Summer Fair this year, how wrong
to donate any of the proceeds to the College Day Nursery.
If they run their own stalls and they are clearly marked
as to where the profits are going, then that would be
acceptable. But to donate any other part of the proceeds,
however small, is ludicrous. Especially as, with the help
of last year's fair, the Nursery purchased an industrial
washing machine costing approximately £1,200. This was
an unnecessary exorbitant expense. The Nursery do not
have the volume of washing to necessitate such a purchase.
What a pity deserving charities like Great Ormond Street
did not get the opportunity to make a far more worthwhile
use of the money.
