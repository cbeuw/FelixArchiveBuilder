THE RESULTS
0-10—You are a complete random.
You have no interest in the Union
and it's activities at all. I hope
you and your rucksack will be
very happy together.
11-40—You're an average sort of
IC student. You know a few
things about the Union from what
you've read in FELIX but you'd
never have anything to do with the
running of it.
41-60—You're a minor hack,
you're at IC primarily to get a
degree but you've got involved
with the social life as well.
61-99—You're a major hack and
you like the sound of your own
voice. You also like the President
and think he's the best thing that
has ever happened to the Union.
100—You're Judith Hackney!
