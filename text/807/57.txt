without imparting a distinct flavour
of their own.
Food additives which
improve or maintain values
NUTRIENTS
Nutrients enrich food, by replacing
the necessary vitamins and minerals
lost during processing or by fortifying
foods with nutrients possibly lacking
in the average diet. It is required by
law for margarine and white flour to
be fortified with certain nutrients
which are present in their natural
alternatives, eg butter and wholemeal
or wholewheat bread.
The legislation of food additives is
controlled by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The
safety of each chemical and its
necessity for use is given full
consideration before it is allowed to
be used in any foodstuff.
All additives have to be included in
the ingredients on each packet. For
convenience some chemicals are
called by their E numbers. These are
EEC codes which are standard
throughout all food manufacturers in
all EEC countries.
No fresh fruits or vegetables may
be coloured, neither may dried nor
condensed milk, tea, coffee or the
flesh of fresh meat, fish or poultry.
Synthetic coal tar dyes all have the
same basic chemical structure and
there is strong evidence that some of
them cause sensitivity reactions in a
certain group of the population. They
are believed to be a major cause of
hyperactivity in children and may
bring about unfavourable reactions in
asthmatics and aspirin-sensitive
people.

Do you know your

chemical additives
are completely
harmless, whereas
others have been
found to cause
E100N Curcumin—naturally occurring orange/yellow colour
extracted from the spice turmeric, for use in pastries,
confectionery, sauces and soups
E101N Riboflavin or lactoflavin—Naturally occurring B group
vitamin usually obtained from yeast or produced
synthetically in a nature-identical form for nutritional
enrichment and fortification of food. It is added to
processed cheese and gives a yellow/orange colour.
E104 Quinoline Yellow (sctd)—Greenish yellow colour often
used with other yellow colours and found especially in
smoked fish.
El 10 Sunset Yellow (sctd)—Yellow colour frequently used with
E102 and appears in a similar range of products.
E120N Cochineal—Natural/nature-identical red colour obtained
from egg yolk and dried insects. Due to its high cost it is
not frequently used.
ElOOs are generally colours

additives
E122 Carmoisine (sctd)—Red/purple colouring agent often added
to raspberry and chocolate-flavoured desserts, marzipan,
jam. cherryade, bottled sauce and breaded meat products.
Amaranth (sctd)—Red colour used to restore the natural .
colour to tinned strawberries. Also added to strawberry
jam. jelly and ice-cream, tomato soup, savoury rice,
cheesecake mix and some meat products.
Erythrosine (sctd)—Red colouring agent rich in the
mineral iodine. It is a regular component of glace cherries,
peach melba yogurt, vacuum-packed ham and pork, tinned
strawberries and certain flavours of crisps and potato-based
snacks.
Indigo Carmine (sctd)—Blue colouring agent added to
gravy mix and certain meat products.
Chlorophyll—Naturally occurring green pigment found in
the leaves and stems of plants. Nature-identical chlorophyll
may be added to green vegetables to enhance their colour.
Copper complex of Chlorophyll—A much more stable
colour obtained by a reaction between copper and the
nature-identical chlorophyll. Used to heighten the green
colour of products such as cucumber relish.
Green S (sctd)—Artificial dye used to restore the expected
green colour to tinned peas. Also added to asparagus soup,
lemon or lime drinks and jellies and mint sauce.
Caramel—Commonly used brown colour and flavouring
agent produced by the caramelisation or burning of sugar
using heat or chemicals. It appears in shandy, soft drinks,
gravy mix, brown bread, cakes, biscuits, malt vinegar,
marmalade and beef products.
Black PN (Brilliant Black PN) (sctd)—Black colouring
agent frequently used to darken fruity sauce.
E153N Carbon Black/Vegetable Carbon—Natural/nature-identical
black colour obtained from burnt plant material. Added to
concentrated fruit juices, preserves and jellies.
E160(a)-(f)N Carotenoids and their derivatives—Plant pigments
occurring naturally in carrots, tomatoes, apricots, oranges,
rosehips and green leafy vegetables, providing a range of
natural colours from yellow to red. It is the nature-identical
compounds which are generally added to food.
E160(b)N Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-carotenes—Beta-carotene is the
well-known substance converted in the body to vitamin A.
It is the orange colour added to biscuits, cakes, margarine,
creamed rice, cheese products and certain soups.
E160(b)N Annatto—Orange/peach pigment naturally present in butter
and cheese. Used to give creamy colour to creamed rice,
coffee creamer, pastry, cheese and cheese products.
