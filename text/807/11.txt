• MORE TALES of sexual
perversion reach my ears. Neil
Motteram, ICU External Affairs
Officer, has admitted to another
misdemeanour. At the FELIX cricket
match a few weeks back, Mr
Motteram revealed a further incident
that took place at his secondary
school. Apparently, his underpants
were itching him so much that he
decided to cut them off. This took
place in a fourth year maths lesson,
aided and abetted by a pair of scissors
belonging to House Committee Chair-
Elect, Andrew 'Midget' Thompson.
Mr Motteram went on to elaborate
how he had disposed of the
underpants in the classroom waste
paper bin. A reliable eye-witness i.e.
Mr Thompson maintains that the bin
was ten yards away from him at the
time and that he had thrown the
offending article halfway across the
classroom. Mr Motteram, however,
swears blind that he only 'placed' the
rags in the bin!
• A BAR EXTENSION was
arranged last Friday in the Union
building. It was originally intended
for the guests at the President's
Dinner—a suitable place to retire to
after their meal. It was pointed out
however, that this was ever so slightly
illegal, as it would constitute a private
party, thereby breaking the terms of
the license. The solution, therefore,
was to open the late bar up to
everyone attending the Ents gig in the
Union building on the same night. As
it happens, the Lounge Bar and Union
Bar. although technically one bar
under the terms of the license, were
segregated to the extent that anyone
who had not attended the President's
Dinner was denied access to the
Union Bar. Tut tut tut.
• WHILST ON the subject, the
Lounge Bar closed promptly at 1
O'Clock—the agreed extension. The
Union Bar, however, stayed open
until nearly 2 O'Clock—breaking the
law. Who was present? Union
President Sydney Harbour-Bridge and
Union Hon Sec Chas Jackson, not to
mention countless other top Union
notables. Tut tut tut.
• TALKING OF BOOZE, now is
*he time to reveal a small incident that
occurred on Sunday May 1st of this
year. ICU President Sydney Harbour-
Bridge was still feeling thirsty after
Southside Bar had kicked everyone
out for the night. He and his
associates, members of Bean's Club,
decided to steal a barrel from
Southside. After gaining entry to
Falmouth-Keogh Hall (by fair means
or foul—this is unclear), they
removed a barrel of Castlemaine
X X X X lager and wheeled it back in
a shopping trolley to Holbein House.
Holbein, surprise, surprise, possesses
a beer cooler unit. The offending
barrel was drunk and presumably left.
It probably still resides behind the
Holbein bar to this day. Mr Harbour-
Bridge and his compatriates were
spotted by three separate witnesses on
their way to the Bean's lair. The boys
in question didn't even have the good
sense to remove their Bean's ties
College refectory staff know about
this. Sources in Southside Bar know
about this. It was even joked about at
Council on Monday. Why has such
a blatant act of theft gone unchecked?
If the Union see fit to investigate
alleged losses in the Union Bar/Snack
Bar which involves the sacking of a
permanent member of staff, why do
they choose to ignore an illegal act by
the President of the Union?
• AFTER A QUIET evening's
drinking in a local pub with friends,
ICU Deputy President Alan Rose had
to negotiate a rather busy zebra
crossing on the Shepherds Bush Road.
Having waited patiently for five
seconds or so, and being rather the
worse for alcohol, Mr Rose could
contain himself no longer and rushed
out in front of the traffic. Fortunately
the car speeding towards him and his
fiance stopped in the nick of time.
Unfortunately the car behind wasn't
so lucky and a rather major crash
echoed around Hammersmith.
Mr Rose's friends hurried on up the
road oblivious to the resulting scene.
• FELIX SUPREMO Judith
Hackney and a friend went shopping
last Saturday to buy some cases of
champagne for tonight's FELIX
buffet dinner. Knowing that the bill
would come to approximately £180,
she wasn't quite sure how to arrange
payment. Sainsbury's, however,
readily agreed to take a cheque for
one hundred pounds accompanied by
cash. This cleaned Ms Hackney and
friend out. Forgetting this, the friend
went out in the middle of Cromwell
Road desparately trying to hail a taxi.
The result was that the dynamic duo
were heading down Prince Consort
Road in a cab with not two pennies
to rub between them. Realising their
mistake, the taxi meter was left
ticking away as Ms Hackney
frantically chased around the Union
Building looking for some cash with
which to pay the unfortunate driver.
• 'ALLEGED' Masonic Lodge
member Sydney Harbour-Bridge (1 °)
handed out social colours to some
members of staff at Monday night's
Council meeting. Recipients were
Assistant College Secretary Peter
Mee (3°), College Registrar James
Chalmers (3°), Natwest Bank
Manager George Jameson (3°) and
Computing lecturer Roy Francis (3°
and member of Imperial College
Lodge No. 4536).
Would such a bunch of old fools
have got social colours if they weren't
members of the Masonic Lodge?
•FINALLY, it is with regret that
FELIX must announce the death of
one of its most devoted and regular
members of staff. Chris Jones is no
more. At the tender age of 31 issues,
Chris has died of that age-old
pseudonyms disease, recognition. Mr
Jones was born in thefirstissue of the
year with only one aim on this
planet—to prove a point. The idea
was to create a character out of thin
air and attempt to gain him some kind
of College-wide recognition. The
ultimate aim was to run Chris for ICU
President to show that it doesn't
matter what one does at college as
long as one is well-known to the
student populace. The idea got off to
a good start, particularly when Chris
was writing his own column for
FELIX. Alas, like most secrets, the
cat was soon out of the bag, and Chris
was demoted to the very depths of the
Libel column, later joined by his
fellow nom de plume Delator. It is the
hope of the current Libel columnist,
i.e. The real Chris Jones, that one day
Chris will be back in another guise,
hoodwinking College yet again, but
this time with a slightly longer shelf-
life and an explosive finale. Who
knows, one day the name of Chris
Jones may well be inscribed on the
wooden plaque listing ICU
Presidents. The day that happens is
the day that this Union will have to
stand back and examine itself very
closely indeed. Chris Jones may well
be dead but the spirit of Chris Jones
is still very much alive.
Thanks for everything,
Chris Jones
