College auditors Deloitte, Hoskins
and Sells had prepared a report on the
College Finance Section. The report
described the section as 'working in
an environment of continual crisis
without adequate computer systems or
sufficient experienced staff. The
College installed a new accounting
package last summer, but subsequent
'ad hoc' modifications have made it
impossible to use the manufacturer's
knowledge to solve any problems
which arise in it.
Some bills have been outstanding
for six months and it has been
reported that suppliers' refusals to
deliver has forced Refectories to send
out runners with manually-drawn
cheques every day.
The auditors' report recommended
the installation of a completely new
accounting package and suggested
that 'outside assistance' may be
needed to get the accounts ready by
the end of the year. It was also
remarked that the finance section
appeared to be over staffed.
As the FELIX news story put it, 'It
is unknown...how much the recent
events have cost the College.' This
money will have to be found from
somewhere—but as the College is
reputed to be £3 million in debt, it is
unclear from quite where.
In the same issue of FELIX, it was
revealed the President (now called
Sydney Harbour-Bridge) had called in
the police over a 'large loss' made by
the Bar and Snack Bar during the
previous year.
The following week a FELIX
flysheet was produced to report on the
suspension of the Snack Bar's
Manager and Assistant. The gross
profit deficit in the previous nine
months of trading was thought to be
£35,000 from the Snack Bar and
£6,000 from the Bar. The losses had
been discovered when the new Union
Finance Officer began to examine the
trading outlet's books. In previous
years no accounts had been available
until the annual return of the books
by College, making profit/loss
analysis extremely difficult. As this
review is being written there have
been no charges brought against
anyone and nobody has a clue where
the money's gone.
'Wherever I lay my
hat, that's my
home'
There has been very little good news
about accommodation this year. To
begin the summer, Southside
residents had to vacate their rooms by
10am the day after term ended, to
give time for thorough cleaning
before Conference Office guests
College accommodation supremo
Michael Arthur finally leaves IC
arrived. In previous years the
deadline has not been rigidly enforced
and the Union organised a crash pad
for students caught by surprise.
Ten students' who had been
allocated College places over the
summer were shocked to discover that
their rooms had been double booked.
Six were supsequently offered
alternative accommodation. The
students were told of the problem
three days before they were due to
move in, and others were given less
than a week's notice that their
applications had been turned down.
A decision taken by the Student
Residence Committee prompted the
Union to colour-code Union cards
according to Hall of Residence. The
cards were intended to help a security
guard checking the identity of
everyone who entered. However, the
security scheme was postponed for a
year, in order to discover whether the

colour-coded cards were feasible.
Ninety-seven first years were
allocated places in Hamlet Gardens
this year, although there were only
ninety-two places available. It was not
thought that this overbooking would
be a problem, since there are always
untaken places. However, Subwarden
Chris Griffin said that he felt that the
accommodation and social life of
Hamlet Gardens was unsuitable for
first years many of whom had just left
home.
Some of these students moved into
flats which had not yet been
redecorated after the damage inflicted
by summer guests. The majority of
the trouble had been caused by
students of a university in Eire.
Despite the repairs, one flat was later
rudely disturbed by the collapse of a
shower ceiling.
The academic year also started with
a 'shake up' in the Accommodation
Office. The then Assistant College
Secretary, Michael Arthur, took over
temporarily when the
Accommodation Officer Lesley
Gillingham was moved to the Finance
Section.
Rag Week brought the
announcement that 160 head tennancy
places would be lost next year. The
lease on the '220' Hamlet Gardens
block (which contains about 130
student places) as well as that on thirty
places in 8 Earl's Court Square, will
not be renewed. In anticipation of this
event, a new block of twenty, four-
student flats was taken on in Hamlet
last year but this still left a shortfall
of fifty places.
In January, angry students
informed FELIX that some valuable
personal possessions had been sold in
the Linstead Basement Sale on 5th
December. Linstead basement is the
only area in College where students
can leave their belongings over a long
period, but the Hall Committee felt
it should be cleared of the
accumulation of unmarked items.
Three notices were apparently put in
FELIX, advertising the sale and
warning students to remove
unlabelled possessions. The sale
raised over £1100, which was split
between the Hall's 20th birthday party
and the RNLI. Clothes found in
unlabelled boxes were given to
Oxfam, other unlabelled items which
could not be sold were thrown away.
After the sale, however, people
who claim to have labelled their
belongings discovered that they had
been included in the sale. One woman
said she had lost ski equipment worth
£3,000; others claim that their records
and lab books amongst other things
have disappeared. The Warden
apologised for the losses but the hall
convenor commented that he felt that
people who had lost possessions had
not taken adequate care of them and
