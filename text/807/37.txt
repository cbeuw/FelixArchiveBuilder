Physics student in
head transplant
shocker
A first year Physicist Virgil Smith is recovering in St Maro's Hospital
today following Britain's first ever head transplant. Doctors in charge
of the operation told FEELSICK yesterday that it looked as if the whole
exercise had been a success and said that Mr Smith was already sitting
up and eating liquid food.
Mr Smith, aged 19, told
FEELSICK before the operation that
he wanted to further the cause of
science and that it was the only way
he could guarantee getting a first from
his department.
Mr Smith's personal tutor, Max
Brown-Jacket, had the initial idea to
transplant a rocket onto a students
head in order to speed up the human
brain's thought process, and asked for
a volunteer from his lecture group.
It is believed that if the operation
is successful and has the desired
effect that it could help thousands of
future Imperial College students to
achieve their desired degree. 'It's also
a jolly good PR.' said the Rector
yesterday.
Refectory
Manager has
bun in oven
In an exclusive interview with
FEELSICK, last night, College
Refectory Manager, Slob Southey has
revealed that he is pregnant. Rumours
have been circulating for weeks,
following 'Honest Slob's' inability to
get on with anyone and his greasy
appearance. The father of 'Greasy
Slob's' love-child is unknown.
College Chief Security Officer Jeff
Greeves has drawn up a short list of
137 suspects—one of whom is Mr
Southey himself.
Suspicions first arose four weeks
ago when Mr Southey started coming
in late to work complaining of
headaches, diarrhoea and a desire to
eat his own food. 'Rampant Slob's'
beer gut has also been getting
noticeably larger of late.
College notables rallied round to
pay tribute to Mr Southey last night.
The Rector told FEELSICK 'That
bastard deserves all he gets—he
shouldn't put it about so much'.
College Secretary, John Smooth (3°)
added 'It's a bloody shame—he's so
young".
ICU President Sydney Forth Bridge
said last night, 'Alan Rose should
resign immediately—it's a disgrace'.
Mr Rose is 23.
