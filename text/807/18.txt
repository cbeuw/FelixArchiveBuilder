The past academic
year has seen a
stream of dramatic
events throughout
the Union and
College. Finance
'blunders' have hit
Sherfield many
times, causing
unending trouble
and potentially
costing departments
and students
thousands of
pounds. Meanwhile
students were faced
with soaring rents,
substandard or
overcrowded
accommodation and
the loss of several
College-run
properties.
The Union also
went through its
ups and downs,
from the Harlington
Gravel victory to
the loss of a music
room, enduring
numerous
personality clashes
and even the kidnap
of its President.

'The money's too
tight to mention'
The year started as it was to go on,
with an Inland Revenue investigation
revealing that College Refectories
have not paid tax on the wages of their
casual workers. This was to*cost up
to £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 and resulted in the
workers hourly wages being raised
thirty pence to £ 2 . 3 0 , so that the 30p
could be paid as tax.
Meanwhile, the Union made a
minor coup by gaining control of the
College's beer supplies. Since
Imperial is not a member of the NUS
it is unable to benefit from the
National Student Services
Organisation Scheme, so it was
thought that the new central ordering
system would result in 'substantial
savings'.
By the end of the summer, it had
been revealed that the money from
sales of Harlington Gravel in fact
should be used for the 'improvement
of student facilities in South
Kensington', according to long-
standing agreements. The profits from
gravel extraction could well be as
much as £3 million in total, or about
£ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. As the extraction is
damaging the sports pitches at
Harlington and the money is now
controlled by the College Athletics
Committee, the proceeds will be used
to start a trust fund which will pay for
a new sports centre in South
Kensington.
Ents got off to a similarly good
start, taking around £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 in
entrance fees at their Freshers' Week
events. The profits were to be used
to subsidise other Ents events.
Unfortunately, over £ 1 0 0 in cash,
several jackets, credit cards and a
passport were stolen at the Friday Ball
that week, which presumably reduced
the good time had by all.
Autumn was also a happy time for
Rag, which raised in a term almost
as much as was raised during the
whole of the previous year. A new,
record Rag Week total of £ 1 0 , 8 4 0
was achieved.
A conman hit Imperial at the end
of the first term, tricking a student
into giving him £1,000. This was not
the first time he was seen at the
College but. as far as is known, it was
the last time he was successful.
At the same time, a new permanent
member of staff was appointed in the
Union Office. Reggie Blennerhasset
was engaged as Finance Officer and
started work after Christmas and
arrived just in time for the discovery
of the amazing RCSU debt. The new
RCSU Senior Treasurer, Dr Ken
Bignal found over £ 5 , 0 0 0 of
accumulated College bills outstanding
and another £ 5 0 0 lost on Freshers'
Dinners. Dave Williams, the Junior
Treasurer, attributed the debts to a
bad attitude in the Union over
spending. He added that Union
activities would have to stop when the
year's allocations run out.
Returning to College after the
Christmas holiday, students were
informed they could expect a 4%
increase in grants next year. Parental
contributions will rise but the
threshold for parental incomes, as
well as the points on the'ccntribution
scale, will rise an average of 6.5%.
It was a pleasant surprise to many that
the increase is comparable to the
inflation rate, but unfortunately the
rise in house prices (and,
correspondingly in rents) in the South
East has been about 20% this year.
President Ian Howgate expressed his
dissatisfaction with the increase, in
view of the cuts in Housing Benefit,
and that the Government is
'instigating the student loan system
already'.
More trouble in the College
Finance Section was revealed at the
beginning of January. A series of
catastrophic failures of the disc sub-
system in the new year made it
impossible to process staff expenses
or to pay suppliers who were starting
to refuse to deliver until their bills
were settled. The Union was also
beginning to complain that the
College had not finished the 1986/87
Union audit. Although this should
have been over by November many
sections had not been examined.
In February, the Education
Secretary Kenneth Baker denied that
the Government would interfere in the
allocation of funds by the new
University Funding Council. He
added that there would be
amendments to the Great Education
Reform Bill ensuring the Secretary of
State had no power to specify how
money would be distributed.
It was announced that the Union
would gain yet another permanent
member of staff, bringing the total in
the Union Office to one part-time and
four full-time employees. The latest
addition was to be a Union Manager,
responsible for the Snack Bar, Bar,
transport and possibly the Southside
Shop if it were taken over in the
future. The Manager, Dave Peacock,
started work after Easter after
working in U L U looking after its
shop.
Just before the Easter holiday, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer
announced in his Budget that
covenants will be abolished for
students. In compensation, parents of
students entering higher education for
the first time next autumn will be
expected to pay up to 25% less
towards their maintenance. This
reduction was much higher than had
been expected and the bill will be
picked up by the student's LEA rather
than causing a drop in grants.
However, students already in higher
education will not receive any extra
money, even if they do not have a
current covenant it was decided.

returned for the Summer term, the
