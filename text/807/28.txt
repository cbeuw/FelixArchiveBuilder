LONDON RECRUITMENT FAIR
So, you've finally
got that well-earned
degree from
Imperial College!
Where do you go
from here? Russ
Clark, head of the
College Careers
Service takes a
brief look at the
London
Recruitment Fair
and how to find a
job this Summer.
If it's Summer, it must be the London
Recruitment Fair! There is no doubt
that this Fair is now firmly established
as the most popular means for finding
a job after graduation. More and more
students are waiting until the nail-
biting, coffee-drinking and hand-
sweating of Finals are over before
making serious efforts to find
employment. That was the case for
10,000 graduates who attended last
year and the numbers this year will
probably be even higher.
But what exactly is it? Well it's not
a lot different from the Industrial
Society's Careers Fair which many of
you will have attended last Autumn.
The third day in fact, will be devo'ed
solely to giving information to
penultimate year students. Tijat may
at least help you to visualise what it
might be like. There are a few
important differences though and the
first of these is size. There will be
more than 150 employers at the fair
on each of the three days—which,
incidentally, are 29th and 30th June,
and 1st July. It is held at the Business
Design Centre in Islington, a huge
building which was once used to hold
agricultural shows. It has recently
been totally refurbished to provide
exhibition facilities on a grand scale.
The second difference is the sheer
volume of people attending. If you've
been to Petticoat Lane market on a
Sunday morning you'll have some
idea of just how busy it is. In fact,
the Fair is very much like a market.
Employees set up stalls and attempt
to sell their tasty jobs to unsuspecting
shoppers! The trouble is, they don't
sell to everyone, only those who are
well-presented, well-informed, highly
motivated and who possess the range
of qualities for which they are
looking.
What can you do to make yourself
more attractive to them? First of all,
you should invest in some smart
clothes, if you haven't already got
some. Second, you should do all you
can before the Fair to find out who
will be there, what sort of jobs they
may have on offer and which of these
you want to target on the day or days
you are there. You should then spend
as much time as possible researching
literature, or at the least, their entry
in the careers directory. Give some
thought also to the qualities you think
they will be looking for and decide
which of these you have. That will
help you to sound a lot more
persuasive when you face them at the
Fair. If you can present yourself to
an employer and say in a few
sentences that you have a range of
qualities which you know will interest
them, you are clearly halfway there.
They will probably ask you for a CV
or a completed Standard Application
Form. You should therefore go to the
Fair armed with stocks of these. An
SAF photocopied and backed onto A3
paper can look indistinguishable from
an original. You may, however, like
to leave the section blank which asks
you to state which careers you are
considering. This section requires a
more personal touch than do the other
sections and should be completed
when you know more precisely what
occupational areas you want to apply
for. It is particularly important to vary
your answer if you are applying for
totally different jobs! By the way, if
you think you could do with some
advice on how to complete application
forms and how to interview well,
there will be seminars taking place to
help you.
It is very important not to be over-
awed by the scale and busy-ness of
the Fair. It is very easy to just stand
and watch—rather like at a fun fair
where you want to go on the most
hair-raising ride but haven't got the
nerve. Just get stuck in—even if that
means that your first few words seem
totally garbled. If you are really
nervous—go up to an employer you
are not so interested in and break the
ice with them. The more people you
talk to, the more indifferent you
should become.
Finally, in preparation for the Fair,
do use whatever facilities within the
College Careers Advisory Service
which you think might be helpful.
You could, for example, try a
computer-assisted careers guidance
programme, watch a video, read
some relevant reference literature or
simply pick up careers literature. You
could have a chat with a Careers
Adviser; either in your department or
in the Central Careers Office in
Sherfield if you want to iron out any
problems.
Despite its size and popularity, the
Fair is not the only means of finding
a job. If you find yourself stuck
afterwards, we will be glad to chat
through the alternatives with you.
Russ Clark,
Head of College Careers Service.
