The Moonies movement was founded
in 1954 by the Korf n S"n Myung
Moon. They claim to have a
worldwide membership of 2 million.
Their doctrine is a mixture of the
Bible and Eastern concepts. The aim
is 'to unify and perfect the world'.
This aim is fulfilled by mass inter-
racial marriages between couples who
have never met.
The cult is incredibly wealthy as a
body. It owns weapon plants, hotels
and newspapers including the
Washington Times. However, the
followers live in poverty. They are
persuaded to cut off ties with family
and existing friends, to give up jobs
and possessions and live at one of the
Church's centres.
The Moonies have a student branch
known as the Collegiate Assocation
for Research in Principle (CARP)
which visit Imperial every spring
term. CARP have around 2000
members recruiting in the UK this
year. They approach lost or lonely
young people and invite them back to
their Lancaster date HQ for a free
meal. This is often followed by
weekend courses with intensive
teaching consisting of physical

This school has its headquarters in
Queens Gate where it runs philosophy
courses for students. The philosophy
they teach is their own. When you
attend a course they tell you not to talk
about the content of their lectures to
friends. If you decide to drop out of
the course, they will continually
pester you as to why you left. Most
lecturers are unpaid and a number of
students are persuaded to help at the
school free of charge.
