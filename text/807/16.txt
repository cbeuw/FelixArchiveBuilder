FELIX
IC RADIO NEXT YEAR
Listening to you...
Imperial College Radio next year
For almost ten years. Imperial
College Radio has been broadcasting
to the Southside and Linstead Halls
on 999kHz medium wave. The
programmes that we provide at the
moment are mostly music, and can be
heard in the mornings and evenings.
As well as our medium wave service,
we can be heard in the JCR at
lunchtimes as well as in Evelyn
Gardens.
Well, that's the 'Story so far', but
what's going to happen next year? As
we move in to our second decade,
we're going to try and tailor our
service more closely to what we think
people want to listen to. I'm sure that
this has been said before, and you
may not believe it. If you don't, the
best thing to do is to come and join
us. The membership fee this year was
four pounds, which put a lot of people
off. Next year you can get involved
for only one pound, and you'll be
allowed to do just about what you
want to. We're always very keen to
let people do specialist music shows,
although there have to be some
restrictions on when you can do
them—heavy metal clog dancing
doesn't go down too well at breakfast
time!
Aside from the specialist music
shows, we're going to try and give
the station a much more definite style
next year. This doesn't mean that
people won't be allowed to choose
what they play, but it does mean that
they will be encouraged to play
certain sorts of records. Exactly what
sort is actually going to depend on
you, the listeners.
One of the little known facts about
IC Radio is that we have a written
record of almost everything that has
been played on air, and whether or
not it was a request. Over the
summer, we'll be going through some
of these lists and seeing what are the
most popular records, then basing our
output on those. Hopefully this will
mean that we will be playing much
more of the sort of music that you
like, and we'll be reviewing the list
regularly so that it doesn't become
predictable.
No matter how good we sound as
a result of our new music policy, it
won't be much use if people can't
hear us. Over the summer we'll be
doing quite a lot of work, so that in
October our signal will be clearer than
ever before. Another of our long term
projects is a move to FM in Southside
and Linstead (we can't reach all hall
residents until the law is changed),
and we'll be doing some test
transmissions during the summer. If
these go well, you may be able to hear
some of our programmes in stereo
next year!
Of course, IC Radio isn't just
music; there's also news about what's
happening in College and around
London. This year, we've made a
start with two programmes,
'Streetlife' and 'Viewpoint', and next
year we hope to have much more
information for you, including a
broadcast at around one o'clock to the
JCR to tell you about what's
happening that day.
If none of what I've talked about
so far appeals to you, how about
getting involved in the technical side
of the station? There will be some
interesting challenges for the technical
team over the next year, with the
possibility of running a line to St
Mary's, transmitting on FM in stereo
and trying to get our signal to as many
places as possible.
If yt>u want to get involved, then
come down to the station some time
and find out a bit more about us.
We're next to the Southside Shop, and
we don't bite! Alternatively, drop a
note in the internal mail, or call us on
extension 3440, Garden Hall 555 or
Southside 89.
All in all then, next year is going
to see quite a few changes in Imperial
College Radio. To mark all these
changes, and the start of our second
decade on the air, we'll be trying to
organise more events than ever
before, and designing a new logo to
go with our new style. Over the next
few months, we will be working hard
behind the scenes so that everything
will be ready for the start of next year.
I'm afraid you won't be able to notice
much change in the station until then,
but give us a listen anyway—you may
be pleasantly surprised, and if you
have any criticism, then please let us
know. Next year, we're going to
listen to the people listening to us.
Tune in next October, and hear the
difference.

Station Manager 1988-89.
