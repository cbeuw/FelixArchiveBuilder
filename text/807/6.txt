IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
Here's to the future...
Union Manager
David Peacock
compares Imperial
with American
universities, looks
at what the 'new'
Union plans to
provide and calls
for a greater system
of welfare support
in his own look at
the future of
Imperial College
Union.
I was sitting at home last Sunday,
basking in the sun on a tranquil
afternoon, with only the sound of the
Filofax inserts rustling in the breeze
to disturb the calm.
Foolishly(?) my thoughts turned to
the future and the prospects of the
Union, having discussed the matter at
length recently with people of all sorts
of persuasions and viewpoints.
Obviously everybody will be
opinionated on any given subject but
I thought it worthwhile to jot down
some of the influences that will play
their part in the type of Union that we
could, should and must provide over
the next decade or so. Excuse please,
my commercial bias, as that's my
own field of work, but it certainly has
a large part to play...
The likely
level and
style of
service
This is obviously a strong point of
mine, and I've been known to wax
lyrical over a social drink about the
way things might go. Having been to
the States on a working tour of student
unions (a tough job, but someone had
to do it) I've seen uses of trading
space, facilities and applications of
technology that we might envy, loath
or be left bemused by.
Consider two examples of the US
system in action; one very good, the
other I think you might agree is
abysmal. The first is that of the
"Co-op", a pair of trading outlets run
in Boston by Harvard and MIT
together, where students were
encouraged to use an 'in-store' credit
card, whilst members of the general
public pay by cash. At each financial
year enr1
(he trading results are
announced and if for example the nett
surplus is 10%. then this percentage
is rebated to student card holders. I'd
really like to see the use of a 'smart'
card in our own outlets such that we
might reap similar benefits whenever
they might be appropriate.
This might seem to be a far fetched
idea given our current level of service
provision, but twenty years ago,
who'd have thought that student
unions might have their own travel
shops...
The worst "service' that 1 saw being
provided was one where you could
actually pay for someone to go to
lectures for you, taking notes as
necessary. Nuff said!
What, you
may well
ask, will we
provide?
