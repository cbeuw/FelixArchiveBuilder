Peter Brooke has been
the Conservative
Member of Parliament
for the City of
Westminster and
Westminster South
since 1977. Formerly
Paymaster General, he
recently succeeded
Jeffrey Archer as
Chairman of the
Conservative Party.
. Earlier this month,
FELIX Chief Political
Correspondent Andrew
Waller conducted an
interview with him in
the House of
Commons.
During his time at Oxford University
in the 1950s Mr Brooke was Vice
President of the National Union of
Students, and one of my initial
questions was whether he thought
Imperial College was justified in
remaining outside of that
organisation. He replied that he
always respected Imperial's decision
to leave and that it was any
institution's right to do so if it
believed that it would get better value
for money by staying independent.
On the matter of student loans, he
said he saw the possibility of them
being introduced in the lifetime of this
Parliament (ie before 1992) as the
review body to examine student
support, which was set up by the last
Parliament, has continued working
and is due to report. The body may
find in favour of loans, which were
included (but only as a top up
measure) in the Tory manifesto of last
year's General Election. When asked
whether he thought that student loans
may discourage people from certain
backgrounds from entering higher
education, Mr Brooke remarked tl.at
even at the present moment about one
third of people with the necessary 'A'
Level qualifications were deciding not
to go into higher education. However,
he noted that the Department of
Education would have to consider
possible detrimental effects of loans.
The Great Education Reform Bill
(GERBill, which has been described
in previous issues of FELIX), is going
through Parliament at the moment.
Amongst other things, if the Bill is
passed, the University . Grants
Commitee (UGC) will be replaced
with a University Funding Council
(UFC). For the first time, the
majority of members of the
universities' funding body would be
representatives of commerce and
industry. I put it to Mr Brooke that
this could be to the detriment of such
subjects as Pure Physics and Maths
which do not have short term gains
for the country and industry. He
pointed out that many subjects were
not represented in the present UGC,
and said that he felt it was right that
the majority of the new body should
be composed of people in careers
involved practically with the areas
most graduates move into after
university.
Mr Brooke refused to be drawn on
whether he thought Imperial's
involvement with SDI was justified
and remarked that it was up to the
College.
With regards his position within the
Conservative Party, Mr Brooke told
me he does not see that there have
been any major changes since he was
appointed Chairman. He commented
that it takes about six months to
understand how the party works
before seeking any changes.
Mr Brooke explained that there are
three things which help him most in
running the Tory Party organisation.
One of these is that he runs a business
which is about the same size as the
Tory Party in England and Wales (as
with the other main parties, the
Scottish wing is autonomous) which
employs about 300 people in its
London Central Office. He also has
the experience of having been
Chairman of a Constituency
Association, and a member of
Camden Borough Council. These
jobs, he feels, enable him to
empathise with voluntary workers and
helpers of the party. He has visited
almost all of the eleven regions into
which the party is divided in England
and Wales and describes the party
organisation as a professional back-
up to the voluntary organisation. Mr
Brooke has a part-time deputy;
together they add up to a full-time
equivalent.
The day before the interview, Mr
Brooke had, with the help of a
bulldog, been at the forefront of a
major recruitment campaign. The
campaign's aim is to recruit more of
the record number of people (13.7
million) who voted Conservative in
the last general election. Mr Brooke
said he felt that this undertaking was
necessary as the Party had last held
a major effort to increase membership
ten years ago; there are currently
fewer than a million Conservative
Party members. The disparity
between this figure and the number
of Tory voters prompted the
campaign to be aimed at increasing
membership in all constituencies, not
just those in which the Party has done
badly in recent years.
The recent controversy surrounding
the Prime Minister's speech to the
Assembly of the Church of Scotland
has been widely reported in
newspapers, as Opposition parties and
some Church of England Bishops
attack the emphasis of the speech. Mr
Brooke remarked that it was a brave
thing of her to have done: once done,
it would open oneself up to attack
from one's opponents, he said. He did
not agree that it was an attempt to
storm the moral high ground, rather
that Mrs Thatcher had sought to set
out the Christian underpinning of her
own views and position as a
politician.
The fortunes of the Conservative
Party in Scotland have come under
close examination in recent years. At
the last general election, for example,
the Party won only 10 out of 72 seats.
Whilst not being directly involved
with the party in Scotland, Mr Brooke
claimed that the local election results
last month showed that there were
signs of a recovery (despite being
outpolled by the SNP and controlling
fewer councils than the SLD) and on
the basis of the poll, he suggested that
some European Parliamentary seats
could be won back.
The poll tax has featured in political
debate recently and I asked Mr
Brooke (who, not surprisingly,
wanted to call it a community charge)
if he thought it fair that farm hands
and dukes would pay the same
amount. He replied by asking whether
VAT was unfair because we all pay
it regardless of circumstances. He
described the community charge/poll
tax as a decision at a local basis as to
the level of services a community
wishes to see rendered in the
community. In Mr Brooke's view,
this could result in a more sensible
level of provision of services, as all
voters will have to make financial
contributions towards the provision of
these services.
All the main parties agree that the
present system is unfair, said Mr
Brooke, who conceded that the
Democrats had gone some way to
suggesting an alternative with their
