place, left it for a third of a century
and then came back. I am sure that
it will continue to be an attractor of
the highest talents.
How about the impact of the
privatisation on our research? Here
there is a snag. The Government
would like to see industry pick up the
tabs. Industry is not yet persuaded that
th
at is what they sould do. We are
piggy in the middle. I believe that
industry is gradually recognising that
they will have to do more for, and
with the universities; that the flow of
talented graduates—their lifeblood—
will falter if they do not support the
university structure. They will
support research. But here there is a
further problem: Will they exert
undue influence on what we research?
Will they emphasise the applied, and
perhaps even the mundane, at the
expense of the fundamental and the
strategic? The danger is certainly
there—and must be countered. I
regard the defence of fundamental
work as one of the key responsibilities
which I . and my successors in the
Rectorship, must shoulder.
Perhaps the biggest single problem
facing the College is that of student
housing. The College has a lot of
residential accommodation—but not
nearly enough. I believe that the
solution to this problem is absolutely
key to the future viability of the
College. We are working on a
number of possibilities, some of a
fairly radical nature. The rents in
'new' accommodation may have to be
even higher than those charged
currently for existing
accommodation. That is bad—but not
as bad as having nothing to offer to
students other than the address of the
local estate agent...
I have heard the suggestion made
that we should not stuggle too hard
in finding more accommodation in a
part of the country where it is quite
so difficult. Why not sell the joint,
and move to a green field site,
perhaps even going North of
Watford? There is in fact a minor
practical snag in this plan—we do not
own most of the territory on which
we sit...But even if we did, 1 believe
it would be the wrong route for
Imperial College. True, the rents in
London are high (incidentally nothing
else is—most other things that we
need are cheaper in London than in
the rest of the country). But then we
are also within walking distance of the
theatre and music capital of the world.
London is an exciting place to be—
for everyone with interests in
performing arts, in fine arts. It is also
close to Westminster—giving us a
measure of visibility which we might
applaud or deplore—but which
certainly makes the College very
different from what it would be were
it located elsewhere.
Imperial College is unique. Starting
in 1988 one would probably not
design it the way it is, but it is where
it is; having the particular mixture of
disciplines that we have. I am glad
that we did not start it in 1988.
