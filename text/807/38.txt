You can receive a
whole range of
different stations,
different programmes
and different styles
on your radio;
almost everyone
listens to it. Yet over
half the stations you
can receive in the
London area are
'Pirates'-
broadcasting without
a licence—and
taxpayer's money is
used to shut them
down. Why do we
have the radio we
do...and what
developments can we
expect in the next
few years?
Chris Martin, a
National Officer of
the Community
Radio Association
and ex-Station
Manager of IC Radio
views the
developments.
Radio was never intended for
'broadcasting'—the fact that more
than one person could receive a radio
transmission was considered a
nuisance, when, in 1906, Lee De
Forest (patenter of the Triode—the
first valve amplifier) began to
transmit live singing and records from
his New York laboratory, and, later,
from the Eiffel Tower in France.
Things didn't really get going until
after the 1914-18 war, when three
completely different pressures
combined to set up a radio
broadcasting service—the wireless at
it was known.
The first pressure was from the
manufacturers of radio components
during the war—as is often the case,
military needs and funding forced
huge developments in a short time,
and during the war the technology in
radio had developed considerably.
Now the manufacturers of the new
radio sets needed a market.
Second was the thousands of ex-
servicemen who had built and used
the new wireless sets during the
war—they were aware of the
possibilities of a system of broadcast
radio, and had the knowledge and
experience to make it work.
Third, and most importantly, was
the pressure on governments to set up
a system of broadcasting that they
could control. 1917 had seen the
Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, with
its aim of 'spreading world revolution
by every means available', and the
British authorities were terrified of
anything that would encourage the
spread of communism through war-
ravaged Europe. In 1919 during the
short lived revolution in Germany, the
Soldiers and Workers Council took
over the military radio network to
broadcast 'to all', the state was deeply
alarmed, and was under great
pressure to set up a system that it
controlled.
It is interesting to compare the
different effects these pressures had
in the USA and Britain. In the USA
an attempt to give the state a
monopoly over Radio failed, and
instead a commercial monopoly was
given to the Radio Corporation of
America (RCA); a company made up
from General Electric, Westinghouse,
ATT and United Fruit. They were the
manufactures of radio sets and it was
hoped that, by providing programmes
people would like, they would buy the
receiving sets. The first stations were
set up in 1920, and soon were
appearing all over the USA, with the
first radio advert being broadcast in
1927. selling apartments on Long
Island.
Back in the UK, things were
moving a lot slower, from the Spring
of 1920, the Marconi Company
broadcast daily programmes from
Chelmsford—but by the autumn
complaints were coming from the
military about the 'frivolous' use of
the airwaves—there were cases of
aeroplanes crashing when their
landing instructions were drowned by
'musical evenings'.
An interesting quote comes from C
A Lewis, organiser of programmes
for the BBC who wrote in 1924:
' 'The question may well be asked why
it was that Wireless Telegraphy did
not come into use in the Autumn of
1920, when things were just
beginning to boom in America. The
answer lies in the sentence—we are
British. Let others rush at new
inventions, do the experimenting,
spend the money, take the hard
knocks...but we British sit tight and
look before we leap. "
In truth, the British Government
was far more worried about
'subversive elements' taking over
stations, and imposed a two year
moritarium on broadcasting—the
public could hear concerts from Paris
and The Hague, but the British
airwaves were silent.
Public pressure was growing
however, and in December 1921 '63
wireless societies' handed in a
petition, and the Marconi Company
was allowed to broadcast half an hour
every week; but with a break every
tnree minutes to listen for official
transmissions on that frequency! The
