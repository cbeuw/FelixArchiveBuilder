The
Editor
by the
staff
Judith Hackney will go down in
history as one of the best rounded
FELIX Editors there has been.
However, she has had a traumatic
year. First her printer disappeared
('Emigrated to Australia. Bye!') then
the entire Union turned against her.
The poor woman was reduced to
plying people in the FELIX Office
with garish t-shirts and coffee, in a
desperate attempt to find someone
who would talk to her.
But we exaggerate. Being the first
female FELIX Editor has been no
mean feat. The first sign of the new
regime was a shocking reorganisation
of the FELIX Office to make a cosy
coffee area, as well as a disturbing
tidyness as far as the eye could see.
However, even one as macho as
'Judith couldn't withstand the
untidying efforts of seasoned hacks
for long and by the second term she
was as messy as everyone else.
'Big J' has built up a reputation as
a leader with an iron fist, terrorising
those who dared to cross her. It
wasn't always this way. Initially she
was fairly restrained, only growling
at prospective photocopier users. But
by the start of the second term,
Hackney's dictatorial tendencies were
beginning to emerge. Staff found her
standing on tables and chairs to shout
orders. She was soon brought back
down to Earth when Business
Manager Chris Martin launched a reel
of masking tape at her sylph-like
frame. The staff really noticed the
change in Judith around March when
the FELIX racing correspondent
started making frequent trips to the
Office to ring raceline. Hackney was
soon betting left, right and centre.
By Easter, the alcohol had taken
Judith 'ruling the Office with an iron fist.
effect. Over the holiday, because
Hackney had no paper to bring out,
she started hitting the Southern
Comfort in unheard of quantities, not
to mention the Dairy Milk chocolate.
This later proved to be her downfall.
The booze had obviously clouded her
brain and she hatched some jolly
wacky ideas. One was to continually
produce copies of FELIX larger than
anything attempted before. To collate
a forty-page special was bad enough,
but three weeks before the end of the
Summer Term, the poor dear finally
flipped, 'Hey gang, let's produce an
eighty-four-page last issue' she said.
This was a nightmare. Staff stayed
overnight in the Office in order to
meet deadlines and then spent about
a week collating the wretched thing,
as Jude's great deal with an outside
firm of collators fell through.
Tempers frayed, arguments arose—
Hackney was slagged off day and
night.
She also had the idea of producing
a summer t-shirt, the design of which
was to coincide with the front cover
of the last issue. A design,
incidentally which carried the faces
of all her toyboys. This proved to be
a monumental cock-up—the end result
looking like a five-year old's random
experiment with an airbrush.
In general, Judith has been an
awkward Editor to work for:
contrary, moody, sometimes
miserable and especially bad-
tempered when there are sprogs
about. This year has not been
uneventful.
Joking aside, the past year has been
tremendously good fun. Old Hackney
has been the hardest working
sabbatical and one of the friendliest
people the staff have had the pleasure
of meeting. She has also been pretty
balanced for a FELIX Editor. We
wish her every success when she
returns to being a random student next
vear. and also in the future.
