E L I X
So you've nearly got to the end of this
edition of FELIX. Congratulations! If
I'm allowed to use a cliche, I hope
that you've enjoyed reading the
newspaper as much as I've enjoyed
editing it over the past year.
Now is the time to start reminiscing
about the past academic year and
looking forward to the years ahead.
I was particularly pleased that both
the Rector and Union Manager David
Peacock could find time to write
articles for this issue. I must say that
I find it sad that Professor Ash has
resigned himself to the fact that
Imperial College will be 60%
privatised by the year 1993. Slightly
more heartening was the fact that
David managed to devoted a large
part of his article to the Union's
welfare role along with the services
he would like to see introduced.
There are other articles which I
could highlight from this issue but as
you should have read it all already,
it's a bit pointless isn't it?
Why did I decide to go for an
eighty-four page issue? Well, it's
always been a sort of thing with
FELIX editors and their last issue.
Since I've been at College, each
editor has always tried to beat the
record number of pages for an
individual issue. The record up to last
year was forty pages. It would have
been quite enough to go up to forty-
four this year. But as my ego is
probably greater than even Ian
Howgate's, I decided that I would try
to get out an issue that could not be
beaten by any of my successors.
Perhaps in several years time people
will read this year's bound edition and
chuckle at this attempt, having
witnessed hundred page Fresher
FELIX or the like. But I would still
like to think that this one will take a
lot of beating.
I couldn't have done it without my
staff of course, who took up my
ambitious idea and rallied round to
produce what I like to think as one
of the best student newspapers in this
country. But I'm biased.
FELIX has come a long way in the
last fourteen years since the Editor
became a sabbatical and the Union
took on its own print unit. I think we
have reached something of a turning
point in its life.
Earlier this year Publications Board
set up a working party to look at the
future of the Print Unit. The problem
this year has been that we have taken
on so much College work as well as
Union print work and FELIX has
been so big that the Printer was
working up to ten hours a week
overtime. Something had to be done.
We had the choice to expand or
contract. We couldn't stay as we
were.
The Working Party debated many
different options but finally decided
that we could not afford to expand.
The only direction was contraction.
Hojvever, David Peacock would
like to see a Union Print Shop set up.
He is keen to point out that this does
not necessarily mean taking over our
Print Unit. For if it did, I wo'uld fight
it for all my job was worth. But even
if there was a separate Union Print
Unit to the FELIX Print Unit, it
would still have a dramatic effect on
FELIX as a newspaper. How could
we justify keeping the Editor a
sabbatical if he had no Print Unit to
run for half the week? How could we
afford to produce twenty-four page
issues each week if all our profit-
making work is removed?
Even more disturbing is the recent
trend within the Union to make the
FELIX Editor a 'secondary'
sabbatical. Certain union officers
would like to see a Union committee
edit our newspaper and the fourth
sabbatical would just produce the
thing plus all the other random Union
publicity that they required.
As I write this editorial early on
Tuesday morning, I have heard
rumours that they're 'out to get
FELIX' at today's Extraordinary
General Meeting. By the meeting, this
last issue will have been sent off to
be stapled and trimmed. My job as
FELIX Editor is nearly over. I hope
that they are only rumours and that
the Union doesn't -try to gain more
influence in the content of FELIX. I
wouldn't like to have to say in x years
time that I was the last editor to be
editorially free.
If FELIX lost its editorial freedom,
there would be no point in having a
newspaper. But I will have to leave
the Cat in the capable hands of Bill
Goodwin, next year's FELIX Editor,
who will have far more trouble trying
to defend his freedom when the
Publications Board Chairman doesn't
believe in it.
FELIX this year
I've been generally very happy with
FELIX this year. We have managed
to get out what I think have been the
best possible issues we could have
produced given the constraints of
time, money, labour, and machinery.
The machinery has been the worst
part to cope with. Not one piece of
it in this office has been 100% reliable
all year. My major disappointment
has been with our newest equipment.
The litho would usually break down
every third week—if we were lucky!
In fact, as I'm writing this final
editorial, the damned thing is playing
up once more and it looks as if we're
all going to have a very long night.
Despite the trials and tribulations
of the Print Unit, FELIX has come
out to schedule every time. This has
been due to the dedication of the
FELIX staff. This was one of the
reasons that I became so irate when
Council referred back the
Publications Board colours last
month. They said that FELIX had
awarded too many and so devalued
the colours for the rest of the clubs
and societies. This is utter rot!
We have a duty to get an issue of
FELIX out each Friday. To do this
we are given the equipment, the
Editor, the permanent Printer and the
Typesetter Operator by the Union. If
it was left up to just these three
people, you would pick up, at most,
an eight page FELIX every week—
and that would be pushing it a bit!
This year we managed an average
of about 24 pages every week. The
other sixteen pages, coming from
volunteer student labour. Student staff
have been writing the features and the
news stories, pasting up, collating and
distributing. And at the end of the
year, all that I can give them is lousy
social colours and a credit in FELIX.
The difference between FELIX and
Hockey Club, say, is that if the team
all come down with 'flu, then the
match is postponed. If the FELIX
team all come down with 'flu, we still
have to carry on and get the
newspaper out.
This is getting to sound incredibly
sycophantic. It is something that has
to be said because I appreciate the
help that I have been given by so
many people at this College. I would
like to take this opportunity to single
out a few of the people that have
helped FELIX and the Print Unit this
year:
Chris Martin—has been invaluable
this year. His major role has been as
FELIX Business Manager, but his
involvement hasn't stopped there. He
has been my expert folder,
photocopier man and chief
distributor. He has helped me in every
way he could this year and if the
FELIX Editor could award the
equivalent of the President's Union
General Award, I would not hesitate
in giving one to Chris. I wish him
every success with his writing up.
Pippa Salmon—has been an
invaluable Deputy throughout the
year. If I had one regret about relying
on her so much, it would be that as
a result she has decided to leave her
course temporarily. Pippa is the office
angel. She has a knack of knowing
exactly when to offer you that much
needed cup of tea. She's also a dab
hand at pasting up, collating and sub
editing copy. I hope that she enjoys
her new job next year.
Kamala Sen—has been my expert
proof-reader and folder. She is
another one of those dedicated souls
that has spent a bit too much time in
the FELIX Office and has also
decided to retake her final year next
session. I received a letter a few
weeks ago congratulating FELIX on
its improved spelling and this has
been almost entirely down to Kamala.
I also wish her every success for next
year.
Other people who deserve special
mentions are Al Birch for his
significant collating work; Steve
Black for an excellent science page
each week; William Lumb for
keeping us up-to-date with what's
been happening at St Mary's; Paul
Shanley for being a constant source
of amazement; Dominic Strowbridge
and Henry Sullivan for being
excellent Sports Editors; Andrew
Waller for being a star; Andrew
Clarke, Sumit Guha, Ashley Niblock
and Charles Robin for maintaining
such a quality reviews section; and
Adrian Bourne for all the hard work
he put in over the year.
A special mention must go to the
two members of permanent staff:
Dean and Rose. Dean has been so
flexible and worked so many extra
hours under such intolerable work
conditions that I'm continually
amazed as to how he survives! Rose
has been quietly efficient and it's also
her birthday today, so I'd like to take
this opportunity to wish her many
happy returns and have a happy one!
This week's FELIX
