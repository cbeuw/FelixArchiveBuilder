Maybe Baby (Cert 15)
Two high school kids are in love.
Soon, after a few years apart, one at
CalTech, the other at the University
of Wisconsin, they plan to get married
and live happily ever after with none
of the pitfalls which life scatters
before lesser couples. 'Perhaps it
won't work out' says she. 'No, we're
different' says he. Of course, that's
rubbish. Nobody is different.
The girl is Darcy Eilliot, played
well and with conviction by Molly
Ringwald (The Breakfast Club, Pretty
in Pink). Her boyfriend is Stan
Bobrucz, newcomer Randall
Batinkoff. Together they look good.
Mr and Mrs Happy Couple.
It takes just six attempts, despite the
pill's statistics, for Darcy to become
pregnant. Not the most ideal state of
affairs for a student to be in. What can
they do? Darcy's mother calls for
abortion, but she's a divorcee and
hates to see her daughter follow the
path of wedded bliss. Stan's father
shouts adoption, clouded judgement
this time comes from his wish to push
his son through CalTech. Darcy and
Stan want to keep the child though.
With just over nine hundred dollars
they elope and begin their
independence and expected joy of
each other. Everything is against
them, parents, finances and quite
simply the odds, but Darcy and Stan
have something specialâ€”the kind of
true love most people can't even
imagine. All the same, they don't
have a hope.
As soon as the baby arrives the
tables are turned. Parents, now
grandparents, love it, but the happy
couple can't cope with the stresses
and strains of adulthood proper.
Everything collapses and they
separate, with a little help from
Darcy's bitchy rival.
Director John Avildsen employs his
personal tactic of character
sympathisation perfectly. Identifying
with an adolescent is a simple task for
anyone, so he needed to m;::.. little
effort. The film could have been
based on a true story. Twenty
thousand teenage girls become
pregnant in America every week, we
are told. Most of them probably tackle
the problems of maturing quickly at
least as poorly as Darcy and Stan.
Whether true love can conquer all is
the real uncertainty.
Maybe Baby is a strange film in that
it spends an hour or so showing the
(potentially adolescent) audience how
difficult successful parenthood can be
without suggesting it is unattainable.
Suddenly there is a change of tack and
with a quick slap across the face the
director, writer, producer, etc point
out the problem with teenagers.
Adolescents are adolescent. 'You're
still a kid, you just forgot for a while.'
In making this statement the
approach of the film becomes an
insult. I could almost imagine the
director sniggering at his audience
from behind the camera, saying 'Ha!
You thought I was treating you all as
adults, didn't you?'. Insults hurt most
when they contain an element of truth
and that perhaps is the real point of
the film.
Maybe Baby is not the most
entertaining film around, but given
the reasoning behind the movie it's
one of the most artistically successful.
Molly Ringwald is particularly good
and holds the whole story together.
If you're fond of tear jerkers then
you'll love it, but otherwise give it a
miss. It opened last Friday at Canons
Haymarket, Oxford Street and
Chelsea.

Innerspace
Another of Spielberg's amazingly
successful and phenomenally
entertaining movies hits the small
screen. Innerspace is a tongue in
cheek remake of Fantastic Voyage,
with more than just an excuse for
shrinking people.
Dennis Quaid is brilliant as the
hapless pilot, struggling to survive
inside Martin Short's body. He
doesn't just have to contend with
defence systems and bodily fluids
either. There is another battle in the
outside world between Quaid's team
and a rival collection of nasties, which
would ultimately determine his fate.
The final race against time is both
exciting and hiliarious, and makes this
movie one of the best releases of the
year.
Andrew Clarke.
Woody Allen has a talent for moving
people at the most basic level with the
simplest of storylines. In Radio Days
he does it again with an unashamedly
nostalgic trip down memory lane. He
chronicles the lives of a Jewish family
in Brooklyn at the start of the war and
shows how their lives were influenced
and shaped by the radio stars and
shows of the day.
The joy of the film is in the
humour, derived from affection rather
than ridicule of such fictional classics
as Breakfast with Irene and George
and The Masked Avenger. A host of
Allen regulars all seem perfectly at
ease with the period and style while
Allen links the various sketches
effortlessly into a coherent whole. A
splendid time is guaranteed for all.
