mentioned, can be a great advantage.
Better contacts with the media in the
outside world will be a good
advantage to us, both for the students
involved in those publications and for
the publications themselves, and I
think building and establishing those
links could be very good.
What's the worst aspect of being
President?
Seeing all the work pile up on your
desk and having to spend your
evenings and weekends clearing it at
the end of the week.
This year has been characterised by
a great many problems within the
Union: the loss of £35,000 from the
snack bar, the departure of the
Deputy President, and a good deal
of personal bickering. In retrospect,
do you think that these problems
could have been avoided?
I think one good thing has come out
of those problems, and that is that
we've cleared the ship. When I
started, I said I'd give the students a
new Union, and that's what they've
got next year, a new Union. I do
believe that we could have avoided
some of the petty bickering, and
there's no doubt: Chris Martin put a
very good article in FELIX just
recently, saying how you can come
to compromise. What Chris failed to
gather was the fact that I have one
year in which to achieve something,
and in that year I can only do so
much. I can sit there and report on
everything I do, try to spend twice as
long getting a concensus on
something that would reach a
concensus in the direction it was
going anyhow. Or I can create some
bad feeling but get done twice or three
times as much. Every letter I write to
FELIX, in response to something
petty or pathetic written about me, is
one letter I can't write to something
important, somebody who may need
their financial situation sorting out
with College because they have a
problem, it's one College committee
that I can't reorganise so that the
students get better representation.
The Alternative Prospectus
Supplement this year has been
criticised for not researching its
material properly and for saying
one or two controversial things
about the various departments.
What was your reaction to the
supplement?
The factual information is not very
factual and infact it is all totally being
re-written by myself and next year's
Deputy President, Chas Brereton.
The departments have expressed
thanks that we are doing so. As far
as the editorial was concerned it has
asked whether the author was
qualified to make the suggestions he
did, on the basis that he was not
academically orientated and his
knowledge of College academia was
therefore limited. I feel that his
opinions are valid and should stand-
after all he was elected editor of the
supplement. If this College is
apathetic enough that someone gets
into the position of editing the AP and
that person is a disheartened
individual then it is this College's
responsibility to make sure that does
not happen by improving the welfare
facilities and the academic life at this
college. Far too much impression is
put on the academic side and not
enough on to how a student ought to
be developing in other ways. To say
that we in the Student's Union are
wrong to let a student produce a
publication which comes out in this
form is hypocritical in the extreme.
If you had the chance to be
president over again would you?
Over again, yes. If I was a year back
and I was asked if I wanted to do this
job, yes I would do it again. Would
I, as many people have suggested
stand for presidency again?
Absolutely no way! I've got a lot I
want to do in the rest of my life. There
are some good people already lining
up for posts in the Students Union.
It's something I am pleased about
because I've not seen it happen
before. And as a result I see
absolutely no reason why I should put
another year of my life into Imperial
College Union.
Is there anything else that you
would liked to have achieved given
the time or the opportunity?
If I could have put in more hours
work then I would have definitely
liked to do a lot more on the welfare
side of things. But I've really had a
great problem in finding time to do
very much in those areas. As far as
long term planning and achievements
are concerned, I think I've achieved
as much as I could possibly have
done, especially considering the
uproar in the snack bar over the last
term. I do still hope to be involved
in the Union next year. If there is
anything I would liked to have done
differently, I would have liked to have
said that I had got along with a lot
more students. I do not know how I
could have achieved it. I went in to
clear up what I saw was a mess. I did
not expect to be popular at the end.
I am not particularly popular now, but
I'm glad that I have done it.
Do you think that you will find it
difficult to re-adjust yourself to
academic work?
Quite possibly yes. I can see that I will
have a problem adapting
psychologically to college work
again. There is more of a drudgery
to it, although there is a lot in the
Union that is tedious. But I do feel
that this year has benefitted me greatly
in an organisational way. I now know
how to use my time fully and I have
found that I can use a lot more of my
time for work and enjoy it a lot more.
What are your plans for when you
leave College ?
\ s far as my plans when I leave
;ollege are concerned, I've got a
lumber for next year including a very
arge fund raising project to raise
noney for lots of charities. I don't
quite know where that will leave me
in the future. My overall objectives
ire to make a million pounds before
1 am thirty and then give it all away
and then do it again. Outside of that
I want to be be working on the
accommodation problem in London.
I don't quite know where I'm going
to find the financial backing yet but
1 do know I'm going to find it
somewhere.
What aspects of the Union are you
going to be involved in next year?
Specifically Rag. Because I went and
organised this major fund raising
thing and I've got a lot of satisfaction
out of doing that this year. Such
things as changing my name-
something that I am going to stick
by—running the Bar Birthday Ball,
being kidnapped. But, yeah, I want
to work in Rag and help to advise in
areas such as Academic Affairs. It
will probably be within the
department filtering through the
system, but I will hope that some of
this year's officers who are coming
in will ask me if they have any queries
or my opinion because the amount of
knowledge you pick up of the system
over a year of intensive work is
h u m u n g u s .
Do you think that being President
has increased your popularity with
members of the opposite sex?
I've got to say that this year I have
spent less time in the presence on a
personal level of members of the
opposite sex than I have ever done in
the whole of life. I haven't really had
a personal life. This myth that by
being President you find that people
of the opposite sex flock around you
might be true but I just haven't had
the time to see it happening.
