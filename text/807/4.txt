On vour bike!
Five students from the Royal School
of Mines Mineral Resources
Engineering Department will be
cycling from London to Seoul in
South Korea. The team will set off at
the end of this month to raise money
for the charity Children In Need. The
team hope to reach Seoul in time for
the opening of the Olympic Games on
September 17th.
To help to raise the money the team
will be distributing sponsorship forms
within Imperial and have plans to
issue the forms nationally. They also
hope to donate the proceeds of book
written about the expedition to the
charity.
The team consisting of Paddy
Coleman, Dave Buttler, Kevin Dick,
Pete Calderbank and Maurice
Vanderhaeghen hope to cover one
hundred miles per day. They will be
cycling in shifts, making use of a
minibus leant by Imperial College
Union as a backup vehicle.
Team Leader, Paddy Coleman told
FELIX that the team had decided to
carry out the expedition at Easter.
Since then the expedition and
sponsorship has been organised
within a very short period of time,
despite final examinations. He
admitted that the team had not had
very much time to train for the event,
but hoped that they would be
sufficiently fit to complete the
journey.
Cable TV has been installed in two
Imperial Halls of Residences. Fifteen
extra channels are now available in
Falmouth Keogh and Linstead. The
College TV studio and the Holland
Club have also subscribed. The
Union's television service, STOIC
will be rebroadcasting

residence, in the evenings. On offer
to those halls with the full system are
old and modern film channels, news
channels, a sports channel, arts,
music (MTV), a foreign language and
a childrens' channel.
'these cards are the sort of thing that
everyone should be carrying around
with them.'.
Proposals to include the 'Release'
card information and other welfare
hints with next year's Union card are
currently being considered.
Association. The British Olympic
Association has organised free
accommodation for the riders when
they reach Seoul and will be donating
tickets for the Games. The team will
be donating the money made from the
sale of their bicycles and tents to
Shshhh!
Residents in the Mews behind
Southside have complained to the
Local Authority about late night noise
allegedly caused by students from
Imperial. They are also angry that
window ledges and flower pots were
upturned, in an incident on Friday
Night. College Security have mounted
a late night patrol in an attempt to
apprehend the offenders.
College Security Chief, Geoff
Reeves told FELfX that students were
returning at 2.00 am and making a lot
of noise. 'You can make excuses for
noise, but not for damage', he
commented. He went on to say that
there was no proof that the flowerpots
had been upturned by IC students and
suggested that students from other
Colleges may have been responsible
for some of the noise.
Children in Need when the expedition
is complete.
The children's television
programme, Blue Peter have arranged
an interview with the riders,
provisionally scheduled for tomorrow
night.
Refectories in

according to figures released last
week. The deficit comes in the wake
of last year's record surplus of

According to the Refectory trading
accounts, losses have been made in
the College catering outlets and in
Southside Shop whilst the bars and
wine cellars have accrued a significant
surplus.
Refectory Manager Rob Northey
was at a loss to explain the figures
when contacted by FELIX on
Monday. "I'm riot sure that the
figures are correct, but I'm looking
into it" he commented.
