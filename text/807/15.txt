The Rose Interview
interviewed for FELIX by Paul Shanley
What have you gained from this
year?
I've gained a lot of experience which
can only be of value to me in the
future. I suppose. Even the incidents
which I would not have liked to have
taken place have had their benefits.
Knowing all about the bullsh*t is an
important skill.
You mention incidents that have
taken place. Would you care to
elaborate on these?
Well, the most important one is the
Union Bar/Snack Bar incident. It's
something that always could have
happened. I well recall the Union Bar
Manager saying as much when we
took the thing over. It showed up all
the weaknesses that there were in the
Union, partly administratively. There
are too many people concerned with
covering their own backs and not
concerned with sorting a problem out
even if it means them taking an
element of responsibility themselves.
You have been criticised recently
for taking on a second job with a
computing firm. Do you feel that
your actions have been justifiable?
Some people will criticise anything if
the right strings are pulled. The job
offer that I took, I'd been actively
persuing before the decision to take
away my responsibilities regarding
the various retail outlets that were
affected. My employers wanted me to
•start early. I could have stayed and
done buggerall all year. Alternatively,
I could have stayed and made the sh*t
stuck where it belonged and at the
same time attempted to clear my
name. At the end of the day, I thought
ck you. I'm going to work in a
professional environment. At the time
there was a feeling regarding how
everyone was being treated. The easy
answer is that not enough people were
angry enough—they should have
been. I suppose one could blame it on
apathy or pressure of work or people
believing bollocks because it's the
easiest thing to do.
•
Have you any regrets about the past
year?
I probably trusted too many people's
good nature too much for too long.
I naively believed that the people I
worked with were working for the
Union instead of themselves. I'm very
bitter about that. Realistically, the
only other thing to do would have
been to have resigned early instead of
making a go of it. This would have
been the wrong thing to do. I also
regret not backing Wimbledon for the
Cup.
Have you enjoyed any of the past
year?
Yeh.
What?
(Pause)
It's difficult to put into words. I've
enjoyed it when things have gone well
and I've particularly enjoyed chairing
UFC (Union Finance Committee).
Do you feel that you've achieved
anything as Deputy President?
Well that question is just about as
predictable as a Stock. Aitken and
Waterman song, but never mind. I'd
like to answer it 'no, buggerall and
I don't care' but perhaps that wouldn't
be true. The things that I've achieved
are relatively minor in terms of what
has actually been seen to be done.
However, I truthfully believe that has
always been the case for any one
sabbatical. One can't leave the year
claiming any achievements which are
only insincere promises, pipedreams
and half-baked ideas. I'd like to feel
that I've brought some realism to the
role. Perhaps I ought to say that its
rather like being at the controls of a
supertanker for five minutes.
Changing direction would be nice but
it's about as unlikely as stopping the
thing, as my old mate Gren would
say."
What do you think of your
successor?
I try not to think about my successor.
Which College official do you
admire most and why?
Terry Neville (College Finance
Officer). Because he has been stuck
with a situation far and above
anything Imperial College Union has
had to cope with. He still tries, he still
cares and he bought me a beer once.

I understand that you've been
cooking a lot lately. What >
s your
foolproof recipe for quiche?
Well, if you can't thieve it or buy it,
then I usually use three eggs and the
eyes of dead children. Hike to eat it
accompanied by a dry white wine and
good intelligent company. But one
finds it so hard to come by these days.
How have you got on with your
fellow sabbaticals this year?
It's tended to vary. Occassionally
we've worked well together this year,
but that has been fairly infrequent.
I've often been very worried about
their motives. My attitude now varies
between indifference and amusement.
I couldn't help managing a wry smile
when my girlfriend told me that she'd
nearly, accidently of course, run over
one of them on two separate
occasions.
What is your attitude to the Union
reorganisation?
I don't think it was very well
conceived. There were lots of good
ideas. However, I think the intention
was to change everything overnight.
This just can't be done. An analogy
is the College finance system. Here
the changeover was done after large
amounts of useful consultation took
place. With the Union reorganisation,
a lot of people who could have been
consulted weren't. I'm very worried
about the way the word 'professional'
is bandied about. Okay, the Union
should conduct its affairs in a
professional way, but it's also
important not to lose track of why
we're here and what we're doing. The
best throwaway remark from one of
the protagonists is that the Union
office looks just like 'a student union
office'. I find this remark amazing.
What direction will the Union take
next year?
I think it's going to be a crucial year
next year. How it will shape up all
depends on the people involves. What
is needed is people with the ability to
compromise. This won't happen if an
idealist course is stuck to, with
officers clinging to the ethos of '1 am
right, so nothing else matters'.
