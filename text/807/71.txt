Shy People (Cert 15)
A New York journalist, Diana
Sullivan (Jill Clayburgh) decides to
break away from her hectic lifestyle
and heads for a simpler environment,
accompanied by her flighty 15 year-
old daughter, Grace. She decides to
research her family genealogy, which
leads her to the swamps of Louisiana,
where her uncle, Joe Sullivan used to
live. They move in with Ruth Sullivan
(Barbara Hershey), Joe's widowed
wife and her three sons. These are the
'Shy People' referred to in the title
and are so called because they shun
civilisation and live in a squalid house
in the marshes which is accessible
only by boat.
It is clear from the start that these
are not the usual simple country folk,
and that life in the backwoods isn't
as idyllic as one would have thought.
The mother is a tough, bitter woman,
ruling over her children through fear,
a trait she seems to have inherited
from the dead husband. She lives in
her own world, with her own laws.
She deals out her own idea of justice.
For example, she suspects a man of
poaching and so goes into town and
shoots him. Of her three sons, one is
prone to violence, one is mentally
retarded and the other locked up in
a cage so that he can't run off to the
outside world.
There are two central themes
running through this film. The first
is a clashing of cultures; city slicks
meet country bumpkins. This theme
is dealt with in the scenes featuring
the kids. Grace, the 'hip' city kid,
attempts to subvert the sons by filling
their heads with the teenage ideals of
rebellion and individuality, and
introduces them to the wonders of the
walkman, drugs and sex. Eventually
it is she who suffers from their loss
of innocence.
The second theme is the effect that
Joe Sullivan has on the family. The
man was supposed to have died fifteen
years before, but his family refuse to
acknowledge his death and still live
in fear of him. It is he who seems to
control their lives. It is not made clear
in the film whether Joe is actually
alive or whether his ghost haunts the
swamps. From time to time we see
a sinister silhouette figure in the mists
and for a film like this to take on a
supernatural twist seems silly.
The film holds our interest for the
most part due to the complexity and
character of the family and mysterious
lock that the, apparently deceased, Joe
has on it. But after a while things just
get silly and confusing. Any message
that this film has is lost in the
melodrama. In the end both parties
suffer but also learn from the presence
of the other; the journalist is brought
closer to her daughter, and Joe's
widow realises that she cannot keep
her sons as virtual prisoners any
longer.
The acting in this film is good all
round, especially Barbara Hershey
(Hannah and Her Sisters, The Tin
Men), as the tough Ruth Sullivan. The
photography is also commendable.
Often the narrative is interrupted with
some beautiful shots of the
swampland.
Shy People is a curious, if
somewhat muddled film, but I can't
recommend it as the type of film to
freak out to after the exams.

People
Hothouse Flowers
How ironic it is that such remarkable
talent as the new Irish band Hothouse
Flowers, should have grabbed the
attention of the British record-buying
public via that atrocious annual
display of bad taste, the Eurovision
Song Contest. Nevertheless, the sheer
quality of their hit single Don't Go,
has allowed them to easily live that
tacky episode down. Their much
awaited debut album is no
disappointment either.
Through the plaintive vocals of lead
singer Liam O'Maonlai, each and
every song grabs the attention. The
whole country now knows and loves
Don't Go, but also listen out for the
gospel-influenced I'm Sorry and It
will be Easier in the Morning. Echoes
of Spring-teen and Van Morrison run
through this album and there is some
superb piano playing by O'Maonlai.
The list of great songs seems
endless—buy this album for yourself
and appreciate one of the best albums
of the year so far.
Tracy Chapman
Tracy Chapman
With her single Fast Car rising
steadily up the charts, and a massive
global audience witnessing her talents
at the recent Mandela concert, Tracy
Chapman may prove to be one of the
more surprising successes of 1988.
Being a black folk singer will draw
inevitable comparisons with Joan
Armatrading, but her songs pack a
stronger punch. Her debut album is
an impressive collection of finely-
crafted songs, Chapman's haunting
voice and intelligent lyrics being the
common factors. Apart from Fast Car
a moving dream of escape from the
tedium of life, Behind the Wall a
haunting accappella track about wife-
beating is the strongest track, and
indeed Chapman is at her best in her
political songs. Though her love
songs are also good, they lack the
lyrical bits of the rest of the album.
Nevertheless, this is a confident debut
album from a talented
singer-songwriter.
Lovesexy
Prince
Don't be deceived by the sleeve—
despite the bold, provocative and
downright silly photograph of 'His
Purpleness', this album falls well
short of being Prince's most daring
work to date. The exotic kaleidoscope
of styles that marked Parade and Sign
O' the Times seems to be non-
existent, Prince opting only for the
funky grooves of his earlier work.
The contageous, delicious funk of
Alphabet St promised great things for
the album, but unfortunately only
Glam Slam comes near it. Prince
seems to have concentrated more on
erotica than the actual music. Prince
is normally quite capable of
combining sheer sexuality with great
music, but somehow it doesn't quite
happen on this album.
It has to be said, nevertheless, that
Prince is still well ahead of his rivals.
But it is when you consider that
Prince has been one of the greatest
innovators and entertainers in popular
music, that you realise what a
disappointment this album is.
