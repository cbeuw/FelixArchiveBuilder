S p o r t
A Sports Review of the Year
by Dominic Strowbridge, FELIX Sports Editor 1988
Sport at Imperial has continued to
benefit from the College's affiliation
to the University Athletic Union
(UAU) this year.
Teams from Football, Rugby,
Badminton, Fencing, Hockey and
Squash have all reached the knock-
out stages with the last 16 teams of
their U A U competitions. Football's
5th XI went on to win their cup while
the 2nd XI began an impressive
season with a 17-0 win over QMC.
The Rugby 1st X V dominated their
competition in the Autumn term with
7 consecutive wins. Badminton won
the London College knock-out cup
convincingly and the Fencing teams
did well despite the drink problems
of certain members of their team! The
Hockey 1st XI ended their unlucky
season when they were knocked out
of their competition by Bristol. Their
fortunes were revived by a win in the
University of London sixes
tournament. The year finished for the
five Squash teams with two moving
up divisions, one dropping and the
other two finishing well up.
Karate Club has shown consistent
success, doing especially well at the
British Students Karate
Championships at Crystal Palace,
where the team finished runners-up.
Judo have also had a good year:
hosting the University of London
Intercollegiate Championships, they
were rewarded with a win for the
ladies. Members of this team have
since gone on to win medals for the
University of London in regional
competitions.
The Sailing teams remain (almost)
unbeaten with convincing wins over
Bristol, Kent, Sheffield, Cambridge
and Southampton, and hold the title
of best University of London club.
Boat Club, once again, have
dominated rowing at University level
in the country. A win for the coxless
four at Henley Royal Regatta in the
Challenge Cup lead to several
members of the top squad being
selected for Great Britain crews. The
first two eights won their U A U
competitions and have since also had
notable successes at Ghent
International Regatta and Nottingham
over national crews. The novices and
senior C crews have also done well
at their respective levels, with the
novices winning the 'Head of the
River' in March. A full range of
crews will be entering this year's
Henley Regatta in the next couple of
weeks, ensuring the continuation of
the Club's success.
The Cross Country Club has had an
active year especially with the Hyde
Park Relays, Europe's largest club
running event, in the Autumn term.
Interest in Orienteering has also
grown considerably with a great
increase in the involvement and
enjoyment of this sport. Despite the
unfortunate clashes of their seasons
with exams the Tennis and Cricket
Clubs have both done well to reach
the knock-out stages of their
competitions
The Sports Editors would like to
thank team members for regularly
sending reports to FELIX. Without
these contributions, the rest of
College would probably still think that
everyone disappears home to do yet
more problem sheets on a Wednesday
afternoon, and teams would be cut off
from a valuable source of support.
We hope that next year's team
captains continue to write reports and
encourage more people to get
involved in their sports, at any level.

Players
The Table Tennis Club is currently
looking for people to play in the
Central London League next year.
This is open to anyone who will be
at College next year (including staff
and St Mary's students), although we
would particularly like to hear from
people who have had experience of
playing in a league.
As we have to decide how many
teams to enter by the end of term, we
would like to hear from interested
players as soon as possible. Please
contact one of the following if you
would like to find out more or arrange
a trial:
