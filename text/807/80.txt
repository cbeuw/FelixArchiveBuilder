Conclusions
I've said about all I really want to say.
so it only remains for me to hand over
to next year's Editor, Bill Goodwin,
who wants to tell you all about FELIX
next year.
Cheers! See you around College
next year and have a great Summer.
Lots of love,
It's been a strange year. The student
Union has had more than its fair share
of disasters—the loss of £35,000 from
the Snack Bar, the departure of the
Deputy President, and Sydney
Harbour Bridge's trendy haircut have
provoked frequent cries of "Oh shit"
from the Union big-wigs. It seemed
to have so much potential at the start
of the year.
What will next year bring ? With
the reorganisation of the Union and
the appointment of two new
permanent staff members, and with
next year's sabbaticals on speaking
terms, it could be very exciting
indeed. But of course, it could be an
unmitigated disaster.
At about this time every year the
incumbent FELIX Editor is asked to
produce a spiel telling the world how
her (o! hi: , nation will be the best
thing since (insert your own
cliche here). It has always seemed to
me to be very self indulgent.
Nevertheless, here's a summary of
what ' ' lit expect to find in
FELIX next year and some gentle
encouragement/blatent recruitment
for anyone who might be interested
in helping out next year.
photographs of events appear as they
happen. FELIX has its own darkroom
and processing facilities. If you are
interested in becoming involved in the
photographic side, we can teach you
how to take and develop pictures.
Are You a Postgraduate?
Something that I am very anxious to
achieve is a greater input from
postgraduates. FELIX has generally
Here's to next vear
I am optimistic that we can extend the
news coverage to three pages per
week. There will be much more
coverage of the dealings within the
College and the Departments which
will inevitably have a knock-on effect
on students. Similarly our reporters
will be probing into the decisions
made by the Union and bringing them
out into the open. There will also be
coverage of major clubs events,
ULU, and, I hope a greater input
from postgraduates.
Next year's News Editor is very
enthusiastic, but he needs your help.
If you know of anything happening
within College, your hall of
residence, etc, or if you are planning
an expedition to a remote part of the
world, come and tell us about it.
There is always room for reporters in
FELIX, and, if you fancy trying your
hand, then drop in for a chat and a
coffee. Reporting is one of the most
challenging and rewarding aspects of
work on FELIX. All you need is
enthusiasm—we can teach you how
to write in ' News Style'.

Our Photographic Editor will be
working very closely with the News
Team to ensure that up to date
been orientated towards
undergraduates: however, there are a
large number of postgraduates at
Imperial. With this in mind Next
year's FELIX will have a
'Postgraduate Correspondent',
Yousef Samrout, a mathematics
postgrad has agreed to act as a link
between postgraduates and FELIX.
Yousef is an interesting and
approachable character with the
distinction of having been kidnaped
in Tripoli amongst his claims to fame.
Hopefully Yousef will keep his ear to
the ground for anything which will
affect postgraduates. If you are a
postgraduate, and you would like to
have a chat with Yousef, he can be
contacted on internal 5767. The
success of this experiment depends
largely on the feedback we recieve
from PGs. If something is happening
which might affect postgraduates then
we need to be told, and similarly if
any PGs have any suggestions for
feature articles or other aspects of
FELIX they should get in touch with
either myself or Yousef.
Over the Summer I intend to
produce a number of Postgraduate
Issues. The issue dates have not been
finalised, but four page copies of
Felix should be appearing at roughly
fortnightly intervals. As always we
are open to any contributions,
articles, possible news stories, et
cetera from postgrads and any
undergrads around over the Summer.
In a 'ion to the serious side of
FELL .xt year's publication will
contain a proportion of lighter
articles. There will be a regular
humour page and cartoons courtesy
of Noel Curry, his flatmate (whose
name I've forgotten—sorry) and Dave
Griffiths. There will also be a regular
music spot, sports reports, and a
what's on for those at a loss for
something to do. I would like to see
some opinion articles from the
political societies and any students
with strong views. There will also be
some in depth reports of club
acvtivities.
At a loose End?
We are looking for a Music Editor,
a Science Editor and a Sports Editor.
The posts involve hassling people to
contribute articles, some writing and
editing and some layout design
(pasting up). If anyone is interested
in any of these they should get in
touch. In addition we need the usual
quota of reporters, photographers and
feature writers. These posts next year
will be fairly flexible and there will
be ample scope for trying your hand
at the other activities in the paper.
Membership Cards and Club
Publicity.
I would be grateful if any clubs and
societies etc requiring membership
cards or other printing work over the
Summer would get in touch as soon
as possible. I will not be able to
guarantee that printing will be
completed by freshers week, if clubs
do not make contact soon.
Subscriptions
Anyone wishing to subscribe to
FELIX next year can do so for the
sum of £10. This covers the postage
for a year's subscription. Call in the •
FELIX Office for details.
Have a good Summer.
