was taken and Mr Baker lived to
defend the cause another day.
Shortly before Easter, the Christian
Union was dealt a hard blow when
Council 'refused to fund' the group.
It became apparent that potential CU
members had to sign a declaration of
faith before joining the group and
Council upheld a Union Finance
Committee ruling that this restricted
the CU's membership. Since ICU by-
laws state 'ICU facilities must be open
to all its members' it was decided that
the CU is ineligible for funding. C U
annottnced their intention to fight the
decision as far as possible to try to
gain exemption for religious societies
There have been more EGMs called
this year than in the last 10
but so far they have simply carried
on, as a non-ICU society.
Another dramatic rescue was
effected at the end of the Spring Term
when Canoe Club members ran into
unexpected danger in Wales.
Fortunately another member was able
to help them to safety.
Two large student unions were in
difficulty at Easter. The NUS was
under threat by Conservative MPs.
The clause which would force
individual unions to 'opt in' instead
of the present automatic membership
system was not adopted, but the union
is still unpopular with the
Government.
The ULU sabbatical elections were
rather uneventful as only one of the
top three posts was contested. Stewart
Jackson, of Royal Holloway and
Bedford New College, was returned
unopposed as President as his
opponent was not a registered student.
The contested post, Vice President
(Services), was won by a large margin
by Louise Van der Straeten of
University College (UCL) and Vice
President (Finance and
Administration) was taken by Nicola
Jones, also of UCL. As always no one
at IC (except perhaps ULU hacks) had
heard of any of the candidates, but the
level of indifference which only puts
forward four candidates for three
posts is unprecedented.
It was at the end of April that the
large losses from the Snack Bar, as
well as the Union Bar, were
announced. The Catering Manager
and Assistant were suspended and the
Snack Bar shut down, while
allegations flew about various
people's involvement with the losses.
The casual bar staff were also
dismissed and a new Bar Manager
appointed.
The Catering Manager, Norman
Jardine, was subsequently sacked and
Catering Assistant Mark Anderson,
although reinstated, resigned from his
post. The Snack Bar will be
refurbished over the Summer ready
for the next academic year.
The Union averted more trouble by
asking DebSoc to cancel their South
African debate. After this request
various speakers refused to share a
platform with the South African
Embassy respresentative and Anti-
Apartheid Soc asking people not to
enter the debate, DebSoc Vice Chair
Mark Gialanze was reported to
comment 'The role of the Debating
Society is at stake. Should we or
should we not promote discussion?'
An Imperial student who contracted
meningitis in May is recovering in
hospital, after having been seriously
ill and in intensive care for some
days. Fortunately his was an isolated
case, although several people
contacted the Health Centre with
suspected symptoms.
Twenty-four ICU students

plan to remove Science and Medicine
books from the library and restricting
use to reference only. The protest was
made with the support of Library
staff.
Meanwhile, the Department of
Geology was being assessed by the
University Grants Committee (UGC)
inspectors. Unfortunately IC's efforts
at excellence in Earth Sciences do not
coincide with the UGC's ideas of
good work; as a result about eighty
full-time equivalent student places and
ten staff will be lost. This was not
greeted with much jubilation in
Geology but it is unclear what, if
anything, can be done about it.
'Rain drops keep
falling on my head'
In true news reporting fashion there
has been a good selection of light-
hearted items (commonly known as
space fillers) this .year.
Montpellier scrubbers were
highlighted in the Freshers' issue, but
any rumours of a 'hall of vice' were
unfounded. The residents are in fact
a clean living bunch; so clean in fact
that they gave the hall a thorough
wash and dust. How disappointing!
British Telecom were helping
students to stretch their grants when
the pay telephone in the Union
Building was found to be giving free
calls. For at least two weeks queues
of people eager to ring their aunties
in Australia and Outer Mongolia were
seen filling the entrance hall to the
Union.
The first in a series of mascot thefts
took place in November when The
Players stole ICU Rugby's Arnie.
Arnie, a fibreglass gnome was later
returned not much the worse for the
experience.
The week after Rag Week was
particularly rich in 'minor news
stories'. Readers thrilled to reports of
