Of course all the 'classic' services will
hold their places as drink and food
won't foreseeably go out of fashion
or be replaced with pills, except
during exams, though low/non
alcohol sales may rise dramatically,
as might the College-wide provision
of really healthy food.
Newer concepts should begin to
emerge and become standard.
Run a 'pick and mix' scan across
the following:
Copy Shop, Florist, Newsagent,
Computer Retail, Computer PC Hire,
Insurance/Financial Services.
These are just a few of the
possibilities for development, though
some are obviously more far-fetched
than others.
There is a strong possibility that we
might run some services on a
franchise basis, especially while we
are attempting to evaluate their
suitability and potential, and because
it means that the service is run with
the right commerical expertise from
the start—a crucial point given the
quality of service available on the
'high street'.
Enough
though of
pure
commercial
issues
'What about welfare?' you might be
thinking. College at present is seeking
to reinforce its role in the academic
world more clearly with ever-
increasing pressure from Government
to increase student numbers from a
potentially decreasing student
population. At the same time the
Government is attacking the students'
pocket directly, in the form of
reduced benefits and grants in real
terms. All of this creates an
unfavourable environment for the
achievement of high academic
standards and this creates a greater
need for welfare support.
• These services need to be in place
as soon as possible.
•The staff for these services must
be remunerated at the prevailing
rate, rather than any form of 'half
measure' level that does not get the
best and most appropriately
qualified people.
• Hopefully, this expertise will be
based in the Union as a sanctuary
from some of the possible causes of
the stresses mentioned above.
This whole issue is one of the
reasons why the Student Union as an
employer and carer must generate
funds from trading activities etc.
Hopefully I've shown you my
justification for 'On Campus'
commerce. The rationale could be
taken further but of course it is for
the students themselves through their
elected officers to utilise revenues and
assets as they see fit...not for me.
OPINION
New lecture
timetabling
as proposed
by our
President
Chris Martin, Publications
Board Chair explains why
he believes Sydney Harbour
Bridge was wrong to bypass
the student body.
OK class. Hands up everyone that
knew that our Union President
proposed a major change in the
lecture timetabling to the top College
Governing Body last week? (See
news).
Not many? It's not surprising—only
about one half of the Union hacks at
Monday's Union Council knew. The
President. Sydney Harbour Bridge
(ne Howgate) didn't think it of
sufficient importance to mention it?
He claims to have brought it up at the
previous meeting verbally. But I don't
remember it. It's not in the minutes.
When it was brought up. Mr
Harbour Bridge claimed that it was
only a 'personal' paper, and didn't
represent the views of anyone but
himself.
It appears that any student can
present a paper to the Governing
Body.
It really is the limit to suggest that
such a major change without
discussing it with anybody—how can
he expect College to support things
when even the students might be
against it. Of course, if you are
reaching the end of year in office, you
have a particular bee in your bonnet
and don't want to be bothered with
what democracy exists in the Union
(and you sit on an important College
committee), you can put a proposal
in a 'personal' capacity.
Finally, a suggestion: if you don't
agree with having no time at
lunchtime to hold College-wide club
meetings and don't agree that major
•changes should be put to College
before the students hear about it,
perhaps you could put a paper to
Governing Body too!
