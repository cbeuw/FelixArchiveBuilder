enough standard for the short course
students.
Much jubilation was caused in the
FELIX Office in April, when staff
realised they could use the classic
headline 'Phew, what a scorcher!'.
Warren Duffin was presumably less
amused, since it was his coffee
machine catching fire which
prompted the title. Although quite a
dramatic event, forcing the evacuation
of Linstead Hall, damage was
fortunately limited to Warren's
curtains, and some of his possessions
which were soaked by fire
extinguishers. The coffee machine is
sadly no more—an ex-coffee machine
in fact!
More gravely, another 150 place
in Lexham Gardens are under threat.
At the end of May it was announced
that a Local Authority inspection had
found problems with roofs, drains and
gutters as well as some breaches in
fire regulations. It is thought that the
cost of repairing the faults will make
it uneconomical for the landlord to
use the buildings as student
residences. The current lease runs out
at the end of this month.
Negotiations with the landlord had
carried on for some time before
Finance Section's Malcolm Aldridge
decided it was unlikely that a
settlement would be reached.
'It's so funny that we
don't talk anymore'
added that he wishes such a sale to
be held every year.
The College's Governors set a
target of 100 more students next year,
in an attempt to reduce the College's
debt. In January, ICU President Ian
Howgate criticised the decision as
short-sighted and claimed that the
College would not be able to honour
its guarantee of a year in hall to all
first year undergraduates and overseas
postgraduates. Rayleigh House was to
be sold, with a loss of 26 places, in
order to pay for the furnishing of the
new, 200 place Evelyn Gardens block
now called Fisher Hall.
Thirty of the Fisher Hall places will
be used as Subwardens' rooms and
higher priced accommodation, and
twenty five other places in Evelyn
Gardens will no longer be available.
The next week a notice from the
Environmental Health Officer
declared four single rooms in Lexham
Gardens were too small for
occupation.
By the end of the Spring Term it
looked as if only 35 places had been
gained by taking on the new hall in
Evelyn Gardens:
Lost
130 Hamlet Gardens
30 Earl's Court Square
26 Rayleigh
25 Evelyn Gardens
4 Lexham Gardens
Total=215
Gained
170 Evelyn Gardens
80 Hamlet Gardens
Total=250 =a gain of 35 places
However, there will also be 100 more
students requiring accommodation
next year. This leaves 65 places to be
found.
Throughout the year, another
change in the organisation of College
accommodation has been discussed.
A new postgraduate-only hall was
proposed in order to improve the
social life and working conditions for
postgrads, as well as making the
Summer Accommodation Scheme
more efficient. Southside residents
strongly opposed the exclusion of
undergraduates from any part of the
Southside halls, and they proposed a
UGM motion to this affect* which
was passed.
Eventually the SRC decided to ask
Vickers' permission to make Weeks
a postgrad only hall. Vickers gave
money towards the building of Weeks
on the condition that rooms were
reserved for their sponsored students,
but it was thought that rooms in other
halls could be substituted.
Unfortunately Vickers refused and
SRC has yet to make another
suggestion. The other halls have all
been ruled out for a variety of
reasons.
Silwood Park students also had
cause for complaint over
accommodation this year. Sandyride
House, bought in 1970 to house
overseas students, was sold in order
to build upgraded blocks containing
two-person flats and single rooms
with proper kitchen facilities.
However, Silwood Administrator
Keith Fisher was unwilling to
guarantee all these places to full-time
Silwood students. The flats will be
available for former Sandyride
residents, he said, but the single
rooms will be used for short-course
participants this summer. It is not
clear who will use the single rooms
this time.
Willy Munro, the Silwood Union
Chair, has proposed that residents of
the William Penney Hall should move
into the new blocks as soon as they
are completed. William Penney is
another Silwood residence, which is
to be refurbished this year, but Mr
Fisher does not feel that it would
provide accommodation of a high
The Union's year has been somewhat
rocky, the initially friendly
organisation becoming divided and
bitter. The first sign of this came in
Freshers' Week, with President Ian
Howgate's criticism of the week's
events—and the angry reply of John
Noble, the Entertainments Officer.
Despite this, Ents took a large amount
of money and the events were widely
thought to be a success.
The beginning of the term brought
some more good news for the Union
whan it was known that the profits
from Harlington Gravel would be
used for student facilities rather than
to ease the College's cash flow
problems.
STOIC, the student television
group, made a long-awaited return to
screens around College at the
beginning of the year. Unfortunately
they suffered a series of problems
from then on, ending in their censure
by Publications Board for
'misleading' the Board in order to buy
a new camera. The long suffering
gang also had a break in at their studio
but nothing was taken.
If looks are anything to go by,
Mines Union has been transformed
into a smooth-running, efficient
