broadcasts began on February 14th,
1922. Other companies soon began
fighting for licences to transmit and
manufacture receivers.
The Government, worried about
the Bolshevik Revolution close to
home, ruled out the commercial
anarchy of the US-style, decentralised
system. They wanted to keep central
control of broadcasting—but from a
distance. This apparent contradiction
has been part of British broadcasting
policy ever since. They persuaded the
broadcasters to form a consortium,
which would be run as a public utility
like water, gas or the Post Office.
This became The British Broadcasting
Corporation; its first Directory
General was John Reith.
By supporting the Government line
during the General Strike in 1926, the
BBC managed to avoid being taken
over by the Home Secretary who,
incidentally, was Winston Churchill.
Reith later wrote: 'they know they can
trust us not to be impartial.' The
absence of newspapers during the
. Strike also gave the young
Corporation a national audience just
.vhen it was needed.
"The BBC developed into a
domestic diplomatic service,
representing the British to the
British." Tom Burns—The BBC
Public Institution, Private World
(1977). When Reith left the BBC in
1938, he was congratulated by one
newspaper for 'making the BBC as
thoroughly typical and representative
as the Bank of England'.
In the meantime, US-style popular
radio was coming in from abroad.
Radios Luxembourg and Normandie
were set up in about 1934 with a brief
to find out the programmes an
audience was not allowed to listen to,
then broadcast them from stations
outside the country concerned. Both
were financed by advertising.
' During World War Two, with
Luxembourg and Normandie shut
down and the BBC confining itself to
news and serious music, British
audiences were entertained by Lord
Haw-Haw—a propogandist called
William Joyce, who worked for the
Nazis. By the end of 1939, 30% of
the country listened to him regularly.
In concession to popular taste the
BBC Forces programme was started,
featuring singers such as Vera Lynn.
The war gave radio a great boost,
both in audiences and in technology.
By its end, having heard the American
Forces radio stations throughout the
world, thousands had become familiar
with US pop music programmes.
They then demanded the same from
their own broadcasters.
In 1949 the Wireless Telegraphy
Act was passed, prohibiting
broadcasts without a licence; five
years later the first transistor radio
went on sale in the USA. Aside from
this, however, progress was slow, as
broadcasters turned their attentions to
the new medium of television.
In the years around 1960, pirate
stations began to broadcast from
outside territorial waters in the North
Sea, to South and East England.
Things did not start to move though
until 1964, when an Irish businessman
called Ronan O'Reilly set up Radio
Caroline. Caroline played records the
listeners otherwise could not hear in
the UK and gained an audience of
seven million in its first month. The
1967 Marine Offences Act, however,
limited the pirates, since under she
Act it is illegal to supply or to
advertise on an offshore pirate station.
At the same time as the Act was
introduced, BBC Radio 1 started and
several DJs from the pirates were
employed. Thirty-one BBC local
stations were also set up and financed
by the licence fee. Apart from Radio
Caroline, the offshore pirates
vanished almost overnight.
In 1971, commercial pressures
persuaded the Government to publish
a Bill putting radio which was
independent from the BBC under the
wing of the IBA. Like the BBC, the
IBA has a board of trustees appointed
by the Government, who are
'safeguarded of the national interest',
and have strict controls over what
they can allow to be broadcast.
Again, in the setting up of the IBA
(originally for television), the State
showed that it was not prepared to
lose control of the broadcasting
service. This paranoia means, for
example, that if you want to set up
i newspaper and deliver it to people's
homes, nobody will stop you.
However, try and convey the same
message by radio and you run up
straight against the law, broadcasting
regulations, contraints and all the rest.
The Annan Report of 1977 led to
an expansion of the BBC and ILR
local services to cover more of the
UK, but once into the 80s the going
for the ILR stations (who provide
programmes on a 'franchise' from the
IBA) got a lot tougher. A lot of them,
especially in the smaller coverage
areas, found difficulty in finding
enough advertising income to keep
going. The trend of cutting back on
the expensive news and documentary
services the ILR stations had
promised in their applications was
accelerated. In their place were Top
40 programmes, to attract the largest
audience, and cheap phone ins.
The IBA has done little to keep the
ILR companies to their promises,
considering that it has a duty to watch
over its franchise holders as well as
regulate them. It even has a system
where the rich stations subsidise the
poorer ones. It would argue that a
station broadcasting what they can
afford is better than no station at all.
The increasing deregulation of the
ILR stations and lack of advertising
revenue has forced stations to go for
the largest market for their
advertisers—providing a service to
the public is only secondary. This
market is for Top 40 music, and this
is what the majority of the ILR
stations aim at—it is said that the only
local part of ILR is the traffic reports!
There has also been a trend of the
more successful ILR stations to take
over or buy up the less successful
ones: Capital Radio, the most
successful station, owns Devon Air
in the South West; Red Rose Radio
owns Radio Aire in Leeds and Red
Dragon in Cardiff and so on. ILR
Stations in the same area have also got
together to form 'Networks' so that
one station provides a service that is
put out on all of them. The Yorkshire
Radio Network consists of Radio
Aire, Hallam in Sheffield and
Humberside's Viking Radio. This
cuts costs at the expense of a local
service, but if all they broadcast is pop
music this doesn't really matter.
The early 80s saw another
important development in radio: the
land-based pirate station. The
technology to transmit on the F M
band is now sufficiently cheap as to
make it possible—and even easy—to
set up your own pirate station, and
this began to happen once the
potential was seen. The Department
of Trade and Industry (DTI) division
charged with controlling the airwaves
has been swamped ever since.
The first of these pirates were
black. They wanted to bring soul and
reggae to the airwaves and there was
no outlet on the legal services. Like
Caroline in the 60s, they set up their
own stations as it was the only way
they had of getting their music played.
Pirates like JBC, Horizon and LWR
have been going ever since.
