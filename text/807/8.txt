The Rector,
Professor Eric Ash,
looks into his
crystal ball and
tells the future of
Imperial College.
The Rector on the fiddle.
The Editor has asked me to inform
everyone as to what the future holds
for the College. Of course, I do not
know. However having, vicariously,
enjoyed the hospitality of her columns
during the year, I felt that I should not
disappoint with quite such an
uncompromising confession of
ignorance.
There are just a few pointers to the
future that can guide us. First of all
this College will remain an elite
institution for teaching and research
in the Sciences and in Engineering as
well as. by next session, in Medicine.
I approve of the concept of 'wider
access", of encouraging a larger
percentage of the school leavers to
participate in higher education. But
we are restricted by our location from
having greatly expansionist
ambitions. Our role will continue to
be the education of exceptionally
talented students; the pursuit of world
class research.
The biggest immediate change is of
course the forthcoming merger with
St Mary's Hospital Medical School.
This will happen first on a formal
level, with much signing of papers
and speeches by the Great and the
Good. The real integration lies in the
hands of real people—the students and
staff who will progressively increase
their interaction on all planes. There
are encouraging signs of this
happening already—certainly on the
research scene, but also between the
students' unions. It was notable that
at the second Summer Fair on
Sunday, the greatest attraction was
that provided by the St Mary's
students, who were indefatigable in
testing cholesterol levels, lung
capacity and blood pressure (
—
including mine; they wanted a record
both before and after the merger).
We'cannot for long talk about the
future without taking note of the
current government policy towards
the universities. The essential aim is
to achieve a measure of privatisation.
Imperial College currently derives
about half its income from the
University Grants Committee; the rest
we earn—by successfully bidding for
grants and contracts, and by student
fees. It is not unreasonable to suggest
that we are about half privatised.
Twenty years ago we were only a
quarter privatised. Looking at the
slope of this 'privatisation factor'
(admittedly not necessarily a reliable
way of foretelling the future) it would
appear that privatisation is increasing
at a rate of 2% per annum. I think it
is highly probably that five years from
now we will be 60% privatised. The
privatisation may proceed even faster,
if the government choose to adopt the
so-called 'voucher' scheme, whereby
adequately prepared school leavers
will be given a voucher, to cover full
cost fees, to 'spend' in any university
of their choice—that is prepared to
accept them.
Does this progressive privatisation
matter? I am not concerned with the
underlying political convictions—my
personal stance is more pragmatic.
How will it affect our dual tasks of
teaching and scholarship? On the
student side—even with vouchers—I
do not think it will make too much
difference. It will underline the nature
of the relationship between student
and university in identifying the
student as the 'customer'—in a
financial as well as a functional sense.
The College will have to convince
potential students that Imperial
College is the place where they can
best develop their potential. But then
we are in that stance already. We
want, and will continue to want the
ablest and the most committed. This
really is a remarkable place, a
remarkable concentration of talent,
enthusiasm and—eccentricity. I think
it is worth emphasising, because it is
one thing one can more easily judge
if, like me, you were a student in the
