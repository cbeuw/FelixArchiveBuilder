Racing Form
There are two main types of racing
form available to the punter. The one
seen by most is that in the
newspapers. There is also more
detailed form carried in The Sporting
Life and The Racing Post. As the
access that most students get is to that
in the national press. I'll give an
explanation here.
Shown is a race held at Sandown
last month. The header gives the time,
name of the race and the distance it
will be run over. The final figure is
the prize money to the winner.
There is a separate line for each
entry into the race. Four days before
the race, a racecard number is
assigned to each horse. This is the
number in the very left hand column.
It dictates the order in which the
horses have been weighted (more on
that later). These numbers have a few
gaps in them ie in the above example,
nos 3. 11 and 12 are missing. This
is because the horses carrying these
numbers have been withdrawn after
the four-day duration stage.
The next item on the racecard is the
horses form. In the guide above, only
the previous six results are shown.
This varies from paper to paper. The
number shown is the position the
horse finished in that particular
race—the most recent being to the
right. 'O' means that the horse did not
finish the first fence. A '-' represents
the end of the racing season. Any
entries to the left of '-' are for last
season. 7' represents the season
before.
In addition, in steeplechase racing,
other abbreviations are used:
U—Horse unseated rider
P—Rider pulled horse up
F—Horse fell at a fence
R—Horse refused to jump a
fence.
Obviously, for flat racing (as above),
these are redundant abbreviations.
Following the horses name, given
in bold type, is a bracketed name.
This is the owner of the horse. This
can sometimes be a good pointer to
any dodgy business going on in the
race. An owner might enter two
horses in the same race, with the
intention of pulling the fancied
selection up and letting the outsider
win.
The next name given is the name
of the trainer. Certain trainer/owner
combinations are worth looking out
for.
The next piece of information is one
of the most important. It consists of
three figures. The first is the horses
age. It is worth remembering that a
five-year-old is not necessarily fitter

than a ten-year-old. Generally, the
older a horse gets, the more suited it
is to longer trips. A short race, such
as the Derby is for three-year-olds
whereas a long distance race such as
The Grand National is suited to nine
or ten-year-olds.
The next two figures are the weight
that the horse is carrying in stones and
pounds. As a horse does better in
successive races, it is given a
handicap, which is the figure shown.
This fluctuates according to a horse's
form. The figure is the minimum
weight that ther rider, saddle and
baggage can add up to. Obviously, a
horse is going to run slightly slower
if it is carrying a stone extra on its
next outing. It is this handicapping
that plays a key factor in the
predicting the outcome of horse races.
The last name is that of the jockey.
Certain jockeys are in form at
different times, but obviously can
have an off day. The jockey is an
apprentice and the figure given is the
jockey's allowance, i.e. how many
pounds less the jockey can carry
below the official handicap.
The last figure is the draw number.
When the four day declarations are
made, the names are put into a hat and
the draw is made. The order in which
they come out is the order in which
they will begin the race along the
starting line. This can be
advantageous on certain courses. A
high draw is favoured on some, a
middle or low on others.
There are a few other terms in the
guide which need explaining. These
are the ones after the mount's name:
C—Horse has previously
won on this course.
D—Horse has previously won
over this distance.
BF—The horse has previously
been beaten whilst
starting as a favourite.
71b ex—Horse has won in the
past ten days and so has
a 71b penalty added to its
handicap rating.
Given below the main body of form
is the betting forecast. This is a list
of the starting prices that the'
newspaper has predicted.
Finally the number of horses that
will start the race is given.
The form guide shown from this
particular paper gives details of the
last meeting that each entry has been
engaged in. For example, Sparky
Lad, carrying 7st 7
1
b won, beating
Colway Rally into second place.
Colway Rally was carrying 9st 101b
and was beaten by a neck at Lingfield
on May 21st. The official going was
firm to good and it was a seven
furlong race.
Once you've taken into account all
these factors, how do you select a
winner?
Well, ideally, if a horse repeats a
race, carrying the same weight, with
the same going, same jockey etc., it
should complete the race in exactly
the same time. In practice, nothing
could be further from the truth. As
well as the fact that no two days are
exactly the same, there is also a
certain degree of monkey-business
that occurs in the racing world.
Various methods exist for
attempting to predict which mount
will win a particular race. As a good
rule of thumb, if a horse has run a
particularity stunning race and at its
next outing it is carrying only slightly
more weight, then it is probably going
to run another blinder. However,
the going might be different. For
