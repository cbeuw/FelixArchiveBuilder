counsel or procure' the suicide of
another person.
The laws on suicide are of
particular concern to life insurance
companies. These are guided by the
law that one cannot benefit from a
crime. Thus as long as suicide
remained a crime no payments were
made to beneficiaries. Now unless it
can be proved that the policy was
taken out with a view to profit,
payment is made.
Variations
Despite the uncertainties about the
phenomenon, several correlations
have been made. Religious
devoutness seems to show a close
correlation with a low suicide rate
when figures for different countries
are compared. Exceptions are Austria
and Hungary, both staunchly Roman
Catholic yet both with suicide rates
among the top five in the world
according to a 1968 World Health
Organisation report. High suicide
rates also exist in West Berlin and
Sweden, while the UK is in the lower
part of the range for European
countries. Factors which might
influence the figures include the age
distribution in the population—the
suicide rate seems related to age,
tending to increase for older people.
Another curious pattern is the
seasonal variation. Suicides are more
frequent during Spring—April, May
and June in the northern hemisphere.
Social class is another factor
appearing to influence the suicide
rate, with unskilled workers and
professionals, being most at risk, as
compared with lower rates among
skilled and semi-skilled workers.
Students and doctors are particularly
high risk groups.
The vulnerability of students is
probably due to the competitive
nature of degree courses, and the lack
of structure in a student's personal
life. The high rate of suicide in this
group has led to several studies
comparing universities. Oxford and
Cambridge showed by far the highest
rates among British universities.
Social structure is a definite factor.
Isolation makes people more
vulnerable; and a study by Cresswell
and Smith showed a correlation
between the suicide rate and the
male/female ratio at a university. The
higher the ratio, the more suicides
occured, especially when the
imbalance could not be rectified by
mixing with people outside the
university itself. The ratio at which
the suicide rate should be lowest was
calculated at 2.5:1. There have been
suicide attempts in IC halls of
residence, but the incidence seems to
be no higher here than anywhere else.
The majority of people committing
suicide are male, though the gap
between the figures for men and
women has been decreasing.
However, relatively more women
seem to attempt suicide. The most
common explanation given is that
men tend to use more dangerous
methods than women—though
poisoning (including use of gas,
aspirin or narcotic drugs) was most
common for both sexes, a greater
proportion of men used hanging or
other fatally wounding methods. If

How people commit suicide
this reason is valid, one would expect
the total number of suicidal acts, fatal
and non-fatal, to be the same for both
sexes. Yet the total number of such
acts is greater for women. A plausible
reason seems to be that women may
use the 'appeal' value of the act more
frequently than men, who have other
means of exerting pressure on the
environment—muscular power for
example.
This 'appeal' is effective in some
cases. People's attitudes to the victim
may change so that conditions are
better. On the other hand a suicide
attempt may break up an already
shaky relationship.
Now What?
There are difficulties with treating
people who have attempted suicide.
Hospital treatment may cause
problems with the stigma of mental
illness and difficulty with staff
attitudes, and many patients are
discharged after forty-eight hours.
They often return to conditions
similar to those leading to the attempt
in the first place. The preferred
method of aftercare, psychotherapy,
is often refused by the patient.
Follow-up studies, however, seem to
show that relatively few people who
attempt suicide actually kill
themselves later, the dangerous
period being the first few years after
an attempt.
The statistical data seems to show
that suicide is inevitable. But when
one looks at individual cases, one
feels that almost all could have been
prevented. Though most suicides
come as a shock to relatives and
others, it is often found that some
warning has been given, whether a
deliberate threat of self-destruction or
merely the expression of a wish to be
dead. So the belief that those who
threaten suicide do not carry it out is
a dangerous misconception. Various
organisations exist to try to help
people before they reach the point of
attempting suicide: The Samaritans
are probably best known. Around
College people to talk to include
Nightline, the doctors, and
departmental tutors.
Suicide is a strange phenomenon.
Whilst being a very personal act it has
great social causes and consequences.
Though the rate of suicide among the
mentally ill is 74 times that of the
general population, a decision to kill
oneself can be a perfectly rational
one. Is war suicide, for it certainly
involves deliberate acts likely to end
in death? This whole article seems
rather morbid and while writing it I
quite often got the impression I was
perhaps doing something I shouldn't,
but to ignore suicide would be to turn
your back on the utter despair of
people in perhaps the worst moments
anybody could face, and why should
one treat them like that?
