proposed local income tax. He said
he was nervous, however, that such
a local income tax could lead to more
people being driven out of inner
cities.
He reasoned that there is already «
problem like this in Liverpool (where
the Tories have two out of the
hundred council seats) and in several
London Boroughs, where people with
oovernment's job in a democratic
system to secure a majority; otherwise
it would lose its business. If it had lost
and the amendment had been carried,
the Government whips would have
jeen roundly criticised. Mr Brooke
remarked that it seemed strange that
they were now being criticised for
doing their job too well. He drew
attention to the votes of the cross
'get up and go' have got up and gone.
Businesses have also been forced out
by high rates and the cycle of inner
city deprivation has become worse
with even less investment in these
areas as a consequence.
I asked Mr Brooke about the Lords'
vote on an amendment to alter the poll
tax legislation, which had prompted
many peers who hardly ever go to the
House to attend and vote. The
attendance was, in fact, the second
highest ever recorded. The
amendment would have deviated the
poll tax system from the
Government's original aim, making
it fairer in the opinion of the
opposition and rebel Tory peers.
Mr Brooke said he did not feel that
the Conservatives had scored an own
goal. He commented that it was the
bench peers who have no party
allegiences, the majority of whom
voted with the Government (perhaps
just to reduce their personal yearly
rates bills by several thousand
pounds).
As he is a former Borough
Councillor, I asked Mr Brooke
whether he thought that the role of
local government has changed over
recent years. He replied that he felt
he couldn't really comment as he was
no longer closely enough involved.
However, he did say that the job was
•'do-able' when he was a Borough
Councillor, although it was
demanding of time to spend in
meetings and in general politics. Mr
Brooke admitted to a suspicion that
the workload of councillors in some
parts of the country has been
needlessly increased because meetings
drag on due to incompetence. This is
having the net effect of discouraging
the more able people from being
councillors, thus reducing the quality
of people coming into the job.
Both of Mr Brooke's parents were
involved in local government, and he
expressed his belief that being a
councillor was a good training for his
work as a Member of Parliament.
Camden was, in his words, a
particularly 'colourful' council.
On the question of the decreasing
powers of local government and
increasing centralisation, Mr Brooke
suggested that the Parties criticising
this policy did not recognise that the
Conservative Party structure was
more decentralised than their own.
This decentralisation has led to S'^me
uncertainty about the Conservat 'e
Party membership figures, as the 561,
constituency associations are
supposedly self-governing and the
Party Chairman's powers of
intervention are very limited. This
contrasts with the national
organisations of the Labour Party and
Democrats. Mr Brooke made the
startling claim that the opposing
parties do not have the same level of
delegation of power to local level that
the Tories have.
Drawing on his experiences as
Party Chairman and in local politics,
Mr Brooke commented that
constituencies can be well lit at times
and then decline when several good
people leave the association. When I
asked whether he was concerned that
many northern constituencies were
not so well lit he attempted to prove
that the political map of England and
Wales had changed very little in over
one hundred years.
As an example, he referred to the
traditional support for the
Conservative Party in the North West
which, he said, stems from the days
when mill workers did not want to
vote for the same party as the Liberal
mill owners. According to Mr
Brooke, the pattern has persisted to
this day, and the Tories 'effectively'
gained as many seats as Labour in the
North West. He asserted that there
was an ebb and flow of seats and that
changes take far longer than one
General Election to come through.
However, the Tories have never
before had such a small number of
Scottish MPs and they have few or no
MPs in major cities like Liverpool
and Newcastle.
Britain is out of step with the rest
of the EEC (and Northern Ireland) in
not using Proportional Representation
to elect its members of the European
Parliament, and there have been
claims that this contravenes the Treaty
of Rome. Mr Brooke said that he has
consistently believed that if PR is to
be introduced then it would be better
to try it out at local level first. He told
me that he felt it unlikely that PR
would be introduced 'at this juncture',
in view of the Euro-elections which
will be held next year.
On the future of politics, Mr
Brooke said he expected that the
Conservative Party would be setting
the agenda for many years to come.
He observed that, on at least five
occasions since the war, the
Government of the day has moved
towards the Oppostion and foresaken
its own ideas, and on each occasion
the Government of the day lost the
next general election. Mr Brooke said
that there was no possibility of the
present Conservative Government
moving towards the present
Opposition.
In fact, he said, the reverse has
been shown in the Kinnock-Hattersley
document on the future of socialism,
which Mr Brooke claimed uses
language normally associated with the
Conservative Party. He further added
that politicians, on the whole,
underestimate the importance of the
intellectual tide which, he maintained
was still flowing in the Government's
favour.
Not surprisingly, the Chairman of
the Conservative Party was unwilling
to comment on the parliamentary
performances of Paddy Ashdown and
Alan Beith, who are leading
contenders for leadership of the
Democrats. He would go no further
than to say that they had different
styles and that the House had seen
more of Alan Beith, who has been in
the House of Commons for ten years
(compared with Ashdown's five).
I had been tipped off that Mr
Brooke is involved with South
American archaeology, and he
described how he had become the
Chair of Trustees for a project to
unearth an Inca settlement. His
interest stems from his study of
Ancient History at Balliol College,
Oxford, and from his late wife's
connections with South America
(where she grew up). Mr Brooke told
me that the project has uncovered a
major Inca settlement on the trail
between Guzco and the last stand on
the Incas' Machu-Picchu, as well as
conducting an ecological survey of the
area.
At the end of the interview, when
subjected to some student enterprise,
Mr Brooke agreed to purchase a
(blue) FELIX sweatshirt (although at
the reduced rate of £6.16, which was
all the change he had with him).
FELIX would like to thank Mr
Brooke for agreeing to this interview
and giving up his valuable time.
