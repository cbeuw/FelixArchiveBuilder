in The Scotsman and the introduction
of omelettes and toasted sandwiches
to the Norman's menu.
A television documentary about the
University of London was broadcast
in December. As well as talking to
Imperial's Rector Prof Eric Ash and
assorted other London academics, the
programme featured an exclusive
interview by Laurie Taylor with last
year's FELIX Editor David Jones. Mr
Jones is currently considering a
contract with Universal Studios.
The Snack Bar started to sell Mates
condoms at the end of November.
Although the full range of standard,
ribbed, coloured and strong was
available, sales were sluggish to say
the least. Perhaps this says something
about IC students (they don't buy
condoms and food in the same place,
for example).
A small child was dealt a 'crushing'
blow by Internal Services Officer Al
Birch in the Snack Bar, when Mr
George was officially accepted as
new RCSU mascot.
Birch accidentally sat on the
unfortunate sprog. Mr Birch was
reported as saying 'it was a close
thing, but I nearly got him'. The baby
escaped in a state of slight surprise.

Poor Al, Assistant Subwarden of
Falmouth Keogh Hall has also had
dealings with The Players, who had
an irresistable urge to remove
Falmouth Keogh's portrait of Lord
Keogh. Threats of police action and
outright pleas were to no avail—until,
when clearing a cupboard in a hall
common area, the missing portrait
was discovered safe and sound. It has
proved impossible to attach any
importance to these events at all.
A world first was recorded at the
beginning of March, when the
Overseas Student Committee held its
first ever basketball competition. The
final was played on the College
volleyball court.
Slightly more momentous was the
opening of the Kebab Bar in
Southside, now patronised by more
students than used the Union Snack
Bar.
A jolly worthy scheme was initiated
by Steve Easterbrook, a DoC
postgrad at the beginning of term.
With the help of President Sydney
Harbour-Bridge, Steve has set up a
waste paper recycling scheme which
may bring in some money for the
Union. In any case, the trees will be
happy. I hope they don't feel insulted
by the inclusion of this story under
'space fillers' but as they say, good
news is no good news.
And very finally, Union Manager
David Peacock was drenched by a
large quantity of water falling from
a great height earlier this month.
College Chief Security Officer Geoff
Reeves told FELIX that he didn't
think it was the work of the notorious
'Phantom Soaker' who operated two
years ago. as he'd 'probably left
College by now'.
The Phantom Splosher is 3'/2.
IC Rowers take part in the World Student Games.
