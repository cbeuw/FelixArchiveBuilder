FELIX: Perhaps we could
start with some background
to Communism ?
Dr. Smith: Marxists are
those Who fight inside the
working class to prepare a
communist revolution, which
we say will take place not be-
cause anyone wants or
doesn't want it, but because
of the material forces which
already exist inside the work-
ing class and which have de-
veloped inside capitalism.
What is the cause of the re-
volution? It is capitalism.
FELIX: Thes ideas were due
to Marx originally?
Dr. Smith: Marx was the
first person to put this on a
scientific basis, Marx and
Engels, and that's where all
our ideas stem from. He did
this at a time when capitalism
was still really a progressive
force in that it was develop-
ing industry. But Marx was
able to see, even at this stage,
where it would lead to, from
private enterprise to the form-
ation of huge monopolies. He
said that there would be tre-
mendous crises and break-
downs of production. These
he regarded as expressing the
rebellion of the productive
forces of industry that grew
up within capitalism against
capital itself.
In the 20th century we live
in the epoch of the revolution
of an international movement
of the wage-earning class,
who represent -the future of
modern industry, in that only
through their taking power is
it possible to bring together
in a planned way all the deve-
loped resources of industry
and science. Until this takes
With the advances made last year by left wing groups in the college there appears
to have been a proliferation of these groups. There is now a Socialist Society, Com-
munist society, ICPAG, the MarxistjLenist study group, and the Young Socialists
Student Society.
The latter is responsible for the daily selling of "Workers' Press" in the Union
Arch. The Y.S. and Workers' Press are both part of the Trotskyist movement, the
Socialist Labour League. But who are the Trotskyists and how do they differ from
the other groups'? To try and clarify this, Felix conducted an interview with Dr.
Cyril Smith of the Mechanical Engineering Department, which appears here in
edited form.

place capitalism condemns
the human race to economic
crises, instability, unemploy-
ment, fascism and war of in-
creasing intensity.
FELIX: What about Trot-
sky? How does he come in?
Dr. Smith: Lenin made a
big development in Marxist
theory in that he saw the
changes that had taken place
in Imperialism since the death
of Marx. It was the highest
stage of capitalism which led
to the world wars. Marx
thought that it was in the ad-
vanced countries that the
working class would first take
power but Lenin saw this was
inaedequate in the 20th cen-
tury. Trotsky, even more so,
understood that the Russian
revolution would be led by
the working class, although

I believe in God. The only
thing is that I must say what
I mean by that. God has al-
ways existed, and He is per-
sonal and good. This God has
created the world in which we
find ourselves, and created
man in His own image. This
does not mean that God has
two arms and two legs, but
rather that man's personality
is not just an illusion, for it is
derived from God's personal-
ity. As every person is created
in God's image, each indivi-
dual is important. This gives
a valid reason for fighting
every form of discrimination,
and for trying to stop any
form of social injustice.
No-one can be content with
the world as it is today, for
the loneliness, unhappiness,
greed and violence in it are
all too obvious. Any system
of beliefs must tell us how
this happened, and what can
be done about it. The Bible
tells us that when God created
the world it was good, and
we should note that the word
'good' has real meaning; it is
based on God's character.
God gave man the choice of
obeying Him or rebelling, and
this shows that man is not a
machine; he is able to de-
cide his own course of ac-
tion. The tragedy is that
man chose to disobey God,
and ever since has been in
rebellion against Him. This
alienation from God has
brought alienation between
men themselves, whereas
there is a God who really
Peter Stephenson ,a Mech. Eng. postgraduate, writes
here on the subject of his religion, the first of several
articles we hope to print concerning students and their
various attitudes to life. Anyone with strong religious
views who wants to give his ^opinion in ]a few hundred

letter rack.
exists and who communicates
with men. He gives them ab-
solute commands; right and
wrong are different. Man has
true moral guilt, and all that
we want to get rid of in the
world stems from this.
The answer to man's dil-
emma is not just better edu-
cation, nor revolution, nor
a better standard of living. It
lies, first and foremost, in
man's relationship to God,
yet the man who turns to
God must do so on God's
conditions. This may seem
harsh, but remember two
things. Firstly, God is your
creator, and who are you to
tell Him what he should do?
Secondly, remember God's
love for you, and all that it
cost Him. I firmly believe
that Jesus Christ is both man
and God. This is the only
description of Him that fits
both the claims that He
made and the character of
His life. One reason for God
to become man in Christ
Jesus was that by doing so
He could communicate with
us. There is a second vital
reason for God becoming
man, and this is that be-
cause to do right is intrin-
sically part of God's char-
acter. He cannot ignore our
moral guilt; He must pun-
ish to remain self-consistent.
The Bible teaches us that
when Christ died, our guilt
was somehow transferred to
Him, and He died for us.
That God was prepared to
go so far to answer man's
need shows how deep is His
hatred of all that is wrong
in the world, and how great
is His love for us.
God's terms for man to
know Him, and for man's
alienation from God to end,
are these. You must believe
that God exists, that He is
personal and yet creator, and
that Jesus Christ is God.
You must acknowledge your
true moral guilt before God.
You must believe that Christ
died at an actual point in
time and space to bear God's
punishment for your guilt.
You must rely entirely on
Christ and not expect God to
acknowledge you or help
you because of anything
that you do.
It is vital to realise how
much is at stake. This is not
a matter that you can ignore.
Christianity is not just wish-
ful thinking. God was not
invented by man to fill man's
needs, but there is a God
who really exists, and there
is meaningful communica-
tion between God and man.
Christianity stands or falls
on whether the resurrection
of Jesus Christ is historical
fact or not. Christians must
be prepared to face the con-
sequences of being proved
wrong. They must say, with
St. Paul, that if you find
the body of Christ, then
they are all deluded and
wasting their time.
A second reason for tak-
ing the Bible seriously is
that it states that there is
life after death. God does
not expect people to hope
against reason that death is
not the end, but instead He
shows us that one man, Jesus
Christ, has already risen
from the dead. The Bible
goes on to say that your fate
in eternity depends on the
choices that you make now;
one reason why Christians
have gone to such lengths to
tell others of their faith is
that they realise what is at
stake.
Finally, don't take all this
talk of eternal life as "pie
in the sky". A faith in God
in the terms that I have des-
cribed means that you are no
longer lost in a world that
seems meaningless and hos-
tile. You find a meaning and
purpose to life, and a qual-
ity of life that cannot be
found in any other way.
the minority, and it would
not be restricted to Russia,
but would only be the begin-
ing of the process of world
revolution.
In the Russian revolution
the working class did take
power but in a very backward
country under conditions of
the most terrible devastation
when the capitalist powers
tried to smash the revolution.
This meant that the revolu-
tion did not spread to the ad-
vanced countries. So you had
a stalemate where the revo-
lution survived inside this
backward country but capi-
talism was able to retain
power in the advanced coun-
tries.
Under these conditions the
Soviet State began to degen-
erate. Lenin fought against
the growth of bureaucraacy,
a layer of managers, techni-
cians and officials, inside the
worker's state. He saw it re-
flected inside his own bol-
shevic party in a group which
began to crystallize around
Josef Stalin.
After Lenin's death, under
Stalin, the bureaucratic layer
began to take control of the
party and state. This was re-
flected in the conception not
of world revolution but of
socialism completely inside
Russia, which was quite op-
posed to anything Lenin and
Marx had talked about.
The definition of Trotsky-
ism lies in the fact that Trot-
sky was the leader of the ten-
dency which fought against
Stalinism. It was the struggle
to continue Lenin's concep-
tion of the Russion revolution
as part of the world revolu-
tion.
FELIX: So it's really a ques-
tion of internal bureaucracy
versus international socialism.
Dr. Smith: Absolutely.
FELIX : So when in "Work-
ers' Press" people are de-
nounced as Stalinist, it is be-
cause of their bureaucratic
attitude to Communism.
Dr. Smith: Yes, but I'd like
to add a bit to that. We call
people Stalinist inside the Bri-
tish communist party, who
aren't all bureaucrats, many
are workers and students.
They are however influenced
by a theoretical outlook
which itself reflects the needs
of that bureaucracy.
FELIX: It would seem rather
unfortunate for you that
when most people talk of
communism they think of
Russia and Stalin.
Dr. Smith: Yes, it's unfor-
tunate but its no good be-
moaning the fact, our task is
to clean up the name of com-
munism which has been
dragged in the mud by the
Stalinists and their hangers-
on in the Communist Party.
We are the continuance of
the historical tendency going
back to Marx, through
Lenin's fight in the Bolshevic
party and Trotsky's struggle
with Stalin.
FELIX: About the Young
Socialists, presumably they
aren't quite the Labour party
equivalent of the Young Con-
servatives?
Dr. Smith: The Young
Socialists Organisation was
set up as the Labour Party
youth movement in 1960.
Then a big struggle took
place inside it against the
policies of Gaitskell and later
Wilson. In 1964 those people
who supported the policies of
Trotsky won the majority at
a Y.S. Conference and re-
fused to keep quiet about the
dangers to the working class
as Wilson prepared to win
the General Election.
They were expelled from
the Labour Party and then
constituted themselves as the
leadership of an independent
youth movement. The lot who
were left renamed themselves
the Labour Party Young
Socialists.
FELIX: So there are two
parallel Young Socialists
movements?
Dr. Smith: Yes.
FELIX: From talking to
people in other left wing
groups I get the impression
that the Young Socialists are
rather unpopular and suspect-
Why do you think this is?
Dr. Smith: In some circles
we are unpopular because we
fight for our own independent
policy. We are not protestors
against the injustice of capi-
talism, we are revolutionaries
who fight to overthrow it.
This brings us up against
many tendencies inside the
workers' movement, no doubt
well - intentioned but who
don't want to see that hap-
pen. We don't like being un-
popular, but we're n o t
worried about it. For us our
principles are scientific prin-
ciples and we wouldn't bend
them for anybody, not for
Mr. Wilson, not for Stalin and
not for Mr. Tariq Ali.
