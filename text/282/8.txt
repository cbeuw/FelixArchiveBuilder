Y Chris Lewis on Films
This year Phoenix Editor Chris Lewis takes over the chair as film reviewer on Felix. Over the vac. Chris
visited America to see how the other half lives, and here he comments on the most publicised recent American Film.
New York, New York What is New York ? A city
of individuals yes but a lonely city, probably the
loneliest on earth. A place where you can die and nobody
would notice except maybe some buckweed rolled in from
Texas. People talk incessantly to themselves, slouch around
oblivious to the world at large. New Yorkers must be the
meanest looking people on earth. They're ugly, misshapen
and deformed. They never laugh, and you're lucky if they'll
spare you a glance. Take care, they'll con you out of your
last dime.
For all its failings it still has a personality all its own.
Its theatres, its movie houses, its pseudo-intellectual atmo-
sphere and its liberal laws attract hopeful young studs like
Joe Buck, hot in pursuit of a quick lay. One wonders all
through the films why he picked New York and not L.A.
or San Francisco.
Poor old Joe, like an innocent out of school just waiting
to be trapped. He sees the Manhattan skyline like the pot
of gold at the end of the rainbow, but it's not long before
the stark face of reality catches up with him. He has to
pay the bell boy and then finds he needs a quarter for the
T.V. set. But he still isn't disillusioned and after laying some
worn out broad in her Park Avenue apartment with the
kind help of her dog he falls under the influence of Ratso
as he is affectionately known.
Joe tells him how he wants to be a hustler and Ratso
convinces him that he needs a manager. After an unhappy
incident with a religious pervert, Joe begins to realise what
New York without money and friends means.
By chance one day while sitting in a coffee bar they
get an invitation to some sort of psychoanalytical party.
They go along and while Ratso helps himself to the food,
Joe true to his innocent looks accepts a drag without realis-
ing that it's loaded. Ups and downs abound and everyone
looks like they came out of a comic strip. Unreal you might
think — no not in New York.
Even stewed out of his mind Joe still manages to pick
up a rich married high society woman and persuades her
to hire him. After playing cat and mouse for a bit he screws
hell out of her, so much to her satisfaction that the next
morning she fixes up appointments for him with some of her
friends. Then just as his future seems assured . . . .
One of the best things the film does is to illustrated in
a rather out of the way fashion the problems of the down
and outs. For the unskilled, life is a succession of lines wait-
ing for jobs as dishwashers, floor sweepers or lavatory
cleaners and for Ratso and Joe it's not even that. They have
to make their way through petty thefts and degrading
rituals. The film brilliantly portrays the relationship between
Joe and Ratso and during one sequence in the graveyard
gives us an insight into the complex character that is Ratso.
Anyone who has worked and lived in Manhattan, which
is New York to most people, will be deeply moved by this
film and will realise that the message is not in the actions
of Joe, although certainly these are important, but in the
inhumanity of cities. We live in a big city too. It might be
as well to look around sometime.
More and more of the films coming out of the states
right now are being made away from Hollywood and L.A.
New York is now the in place for filming. Two of the best
films currently in London were made there. Actors seem to
find more freedom there and feel much more in touch with
reality or at least this is the opinion of Ali Magraw,
captivating star of "Goodbye Columbus." "Midnight Cow-
boy" could have easily been made on a set, but would have
suffered considerably for it. Instead it turns out to be an-
other triumph at the hands of John Schlessinger and stars
Dustin Hoffman as Ratso and John Voight as Joe Buck.
Anyone who has seen The Graduate will be surprised to
see Dustin in this new and completely different role. He
demonstrates his great versatility as an actor, something
which is all too rare in these days of soap operas and type-
cast films. However he cannot resist slipping into his more
familiar comic self as he hobbles down the streets.
The use of flashbacks is becoming more and more common
following the great success of "If", but I wonder if it really
helps the audience or just confuses them. In some of the
sequences the color tones were kept the same and one
hardly knew whether the action was a reflection, actually
happening or about to happen.
I liked this film and highly recommend it to anyone who
has ever felt lonely or depressed, because it gives a very
moving tone picture of loneliness in a city and pays a lot of
attention to detail.
The Phoenix
Man
Chris Lewis is an engineer;
Chris Lewis is an artist.
Such a contradiction in
forms of identity might sug-
gest that the Editor of
Phoenix is also a schizo-
phrenic but for the fact that
both identities exist at one
and the same time. Lewis
the engineer is only made
credible by the fact that he
is on a good Upper Second
in the third year of his Mech.
Eng. course, but Lewis the
artist is amply substantiated
by the last issue of Phoenix,
which made a complete
break with the traditionally
turgid magazine and re-
placed it with a product
worthy of definition as a
literary magazine.
Chris is at present work-

ing on the next issue of
Phoenix, which is due out
early next term. The theme
for this issue is Under-
ground; was chosen because
a glut of poems falling into
this category was received
for the last issue, and is de-
signed to include topics rang-
ing from buskers to ceme-
teries, from resistence groups
to Soho. The theme is not
exclusive, however, and any
subject matter is acceptable,
the only criterion being
quality.
Although all the articles
for the previous Phoenix
were commissioned, Chris
feels that there are many
people who ought to have
their work published, but
do not do so for some rea-
son or other. He was him-
self once wary of having
anything published, for he
felt self-conscious about pre-
senting himself (in the form
of his writing) before a large
audience. He also considers
that many people who write
poetry feel that they are los-
ing some of its intimate per-
sonal value if it is placed be-
fore anyone else to read,
this he would deny, again
having passed through much
the same phase himself.
The function of Phoenix
to Chris is to give an op-
portunity to people who
have the ability to write to
do so, and he feels it is
important for any artist to
be judged critically by as
large an audience as pos-
sible. Chris feels that al-
though Phoenix should
seek to entertain those who
buy it, its importance also
lies in the presentation of
points of view which may
be alien to the pseudo
scientific culture preached
by the academic community
here at I.C. Phoenix also
provides an outlet for stu-
dents who are here by mis-
take; the poetry editor of
last year has now graduated
from Phoenix to an Arts
degree course at Manches-
ter University.
Phoenix is hindered, as
are all artistically orientated
productions at I.C., by the
fact that engineers, and to
a lesser extent scientists,
tend to be conservative in
their outlook, whereas at
the present time artists
have to fight for a future.
Whereas engineers have a
ready made slot to fit into
in society, and which they
are prepared to defend,
artists are constantly seek-
ing a different form of so-
ciety which would provide
them with some form of
niche. In this case, the
Editor feels that Phoenix
will be fulfilling a purpose
if it causes people to un-
derstand just why situations
like those at L.S.E. do
arise.
As a final word of ad-
vice to anyone who may
have had thoughts of writ-
ing for Phoenix, Chris
points out that H. G. Wells,
once a student at I.C., man-
aged to make a name as an
author despite a scientific
education. Although arts
students are helped in their
writing by a continuous
criticism of their work, and
demonstrably greater powers
of imagination, Chris would
remind us that imagination
is rooted in reality.

Preview of Jazz Club Concert
Apart from providing free
entertainment on Sunday
evenings, the IC Jazz club
also has the temerity to hire
professional groups and
charge a modest fee for
people to hear them. The
first such group, appearing
in the former top Union re-
fec. next Wednesday, Octo-
ber 29, is the Mike West-
brook Septet.
It was this group, with a
few changes in personnel,
that held the Saturday night
residence at Ronnie Scott's
old place for a couple of
years until the lease expired,
and almost single-handed
breathed new life into the
currently flourishing British
modern jazz scene.
The band's very individual
identity is based on the com-
positions of its leader and
rather reticent pianist, who
a couple of months ago was
voted the composer most
worthy of deserving wider
recognition in a Downbeat
magazine poll. Westbrook's
arrangements, like those of
Ellington, Mingus, Sun Ra,
etc. are tailored to the indi-
vidual musicians in his
band, and tend to be excit-
ing, colourful, and somehow
faintly nostalgic. Thus the
short, slightly tongue-in-
cheek theme "The Few"
from his LP "Release" im-
mediately evokes everyone's
favourite Battle of Britain
film, while the arrangements
of "Flying Home" and
"Can' Take my Eyes off
You" are both totally con-
temporary and affectionately
retrospective.
The band's soloists are
superb, Now that John Sur-
man has left Britain to show
the rest of the world how to
play baritone, the band's
star soloist is Mike Osborne,
who, no longer dominated
by his former front line part-
ner, has in the last couple of
months become a world
class alto saxophonist, as
anyone who has heard his
trio (hopefully appearing at
IC later in the year) will
testify.
The rest of the group will
probably consist of Malcolm
Griffiths, a shouting trom-
bonist; the Boris Karloff of
the tenor saxophone —
George Khan, late of Pete
Brown's Battered Orna-
ments; trumpeter D a v e
Holdsworth; bassist Harry
Miller, and drummer Alan
Jaxkson an invigorating
evening is guaranteed for all.
