Financial Estimates
Passed by Council
The first I.C.U. Council meeting of the year took place
a week last Monday. It was of medium length, (six.
hours) mediocre content, and fairly peaceful. Piers Corbyn
was able to maintain control over Council, although there
were no really heated debates. The consequences of the
increase in the numbers sitting on Council has yet to be
felt, however, since the department reps, have not yet been
elected, and several members failed to turn up at this
first meeting.
The main matter of interest to the Union member was
finance. The estimates put in at joint Council (held at the
end of last session) were ratified, although there was some
argument, particularly over Ents. expenses, periodicals
and the FELIX subsidy from the Union.
Ents. had asked for a nominal grant. This would mean
that they were no longer a profit making committee, but
that profits from the informal dances would be used to
cover the formal occasions. Previously Ents were expected
to make £500 profit on hops, and received subsidies for
formal occasions. The new zero-grant arrangement was
approved, but Ents were expected to make a slight profit.
In effect the new arrangements mean that the Union will
lose £375 of its expected income.
On periodicals, it was decided to cancel those magazines
which could be obtained elsewhere, e.g. in the libraries. There
was also some criticism, mainly ill-informed, of FELIX's
increased grant of £800 from some council members,
but the new figure was approved.
A more serious discussion arose over the gliding club.
As reported in Felicity 279, this club asked for, and got,
£1500 from I.C.U. for a new glider. However, they did not
reveal that they were already trying to get £500 out of the
college's Centenary Appeal Fund to replace another glider.
Council was annoyed at this and refused to ratify the club's
request to the fund. The club will explain its dealings at
the next Council meeting. Also to put in an appearance
at the next meeting will be the student who was granted
£40 for a film about tribal warfare (?). He has apparently
shot one third _of the film in Cornwall and London and
used up most of his £40, but will put up the rest of the
money himself.
New Uses for Beit Rooms — I.C. Arts Lab?
Piers & Co. at Council
Another matter discussed was the Senior Common
Room. To such comments as "bugger the staff", Council
passed a motion from secretary Keith Guy that the Union
does not recognise the existence of the Senior Common
Room. The Domestic Bursar was, however, said to be "un-
cooperative" over the possible use of the SCR by students.
A series of letters from Mr. Stephenson criticising the
election of Clive Robinson for the Council rep on the
Parking Committee were read; the objection to Clive being
that he parked in the Southside area last year without a
permit. Also on parking, the 10/- fine for illegal parking
was reiterated. This fine will be automatically imposed on
people who persist in parking in the College controlled
areas without a permit. It was felt that more places could
be obtained by more skilful markings on the roadway.
John Darley will investigate the hostility of the Boat
Club to students from other Colleges in the area joining.
All Colleges were circularised with a list of IC clubs
willing to accept other students, but when some from the
CEM tried to join the Boat Club, which was on the list,
the club officials were hostile to them.
On the question of whether the reps on the new-structure
ULU Councils should be responsible to a Union Meeting.
Piers Corbyn expressed the opinion that "the Union doesn't
usually know anything about it anyway". Therefore, these
reps will be mandated by and responsible to Council, but
to help the poor ignorant Union member to understand
the new ULU structure, an open file on U L U will be set
up in the Union Office.
Discussion at the House
Committee meeting on Tues-
day, October 14th centred
around the allocation of
rooms in the Union building
now that more rooms have
become available for use by
the Union.
The two most important
developments concerning
allocation stemmed from a
proposal by the Botany and
Zoology departments to use
the former Senior Common
Room as a coffee room for
the staff and students of
those departments during
certain hours, and a sugges-
tion from Henry that the old
Snack Bar be converted in-
to a virtual I.C. Arts Lab.
John Butterworth ex-
plained that Botany and
Zoology were now quite
isolated following the open-
ing of College Block and
the demise of catering
arrangements in the Union
building. Both staff and
students were most keen to
have somewhere to meet
informally over a cup of
coffee for half an hour in
the morning and afternoon.
The Senior Common Room
was the ideal location for
such a venture, and all the
required items of crockery
etc. would be provided by
the departments.
The idea was approved,
subject to there being a
student committee to run
the project and that the
room would be open to
everybody outside the
specific hours when it would
be used by Botany and
Zoo.
The 'Arts Lab' proposal
Was to provide a permanent
room in the Union with an
atmosphere suitable for the
small events organised by the
college 'Arts' societies.
It would have permanent
lighting effects and an adapt-
able central area with
screens, etc., to allow for a
wide range of activites. The
room would probably be
used as a coffee bar with
music at lunchtime.
The house committee ask-
ed for a more detailed plan,
which would then be put to
Council.
The other main decisions
taken concerned the
approval of the occupation
of Committee Room B by
the Carnival Committee
thereby vacating 8, Prince's
Gardens, which will now be
used by the Art Club. Ents
are to be allowed to use
the Powder Room in the
Union for the storing of the
equipment.
It should also be men-
tioned that Social Clubs
can now book the old Senior
Common Room for events at
most times of the day, in the
same way as the other Union
bookable rooms.
