THE PICNIC
Come the dawn
the thunder broke in waves
from a sea of dark clouds
the people huddled fearfuly in their
cold and barren caves.
But at noon
the clouds parted and a shaft of
golden light shone upon
the few who happily
went their way
in joy of
living.

FELIX plans to start a regular column in which informa-
tion useful to students is included so if you know good places
to eat, drink, pick up members of the opposite sex, see films,
listen to music, buy books, clothes, records, earn money and
so on, please contact Felix and stop keeping it to yourself.
Films:
Late night films close to college. The Electric Cinema Club
is at the far end of the Portobello Road, at the Imperial
Cinema. Films are at 10.15 pm and 12.30 am Wednesday till
Saturday (not 12.30 on Wednesday). The cinema is a flea pit
but the films and audiences are pretty good. Admission 5s.
A bit nearer, the celluloid place is at the Paris-Pullman
cinema in Drayton Gardens just off the Old Brompton Road.
More comfortable but more expensive at 7/6. Programmes
are at 11.00, Wednesday till Sunday.

BLIND
blind berry cannot see
cannot see you or me
cannot hear a word we say
cannot speak and tell us why
but he must know something of us
or we'd slowly fade away
BERRY
IT'S TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
From out the stagnant rotting hulk of the dying
man rose a beautiful youth
METAMORPHOSIS
Now this young man had no face and no body
and wondered somewhat as to what he would like
and what he would do
HE TOOK A FEW STEPS
AND YES
HE COULD FLY
AND SO
with a furious beating of wings he ascended to the
heights
AND
was knocked down by a passing
AEROPLANE
