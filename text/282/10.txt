PARKING PLACE
ALLOCATIONS
Following complaints about
the method and lateness of
allocation of parking places,
Keith Guy has now explained
the system. The forms were
marked by three people. For
the first allocation these were
Messrs. Guy, Wield and Laf-
ferty and twenty-two places
were allocated. In the second
and third allocations these
Messrs. Guy, Bubterworth,
and Robinson. Commuter
places were marked as fol-
lows, there being over 700
applications for 100 places: —
Each form was given 5
points each, and marked 3
times separately. Of the 5
points 2 were for time and
expense saving (over half an
hour per journey). This en-
tailed a lot of time in the
marking, as each application
had to be checked with an
A-Z to get through the swel-
ter of lies. One mark each
went for using the car in col-
lege, one for bringing people
in, and one general mark.
In the allocation of resi-
dents places, one mark was
given to residents whose
homes are a long way from
London, 2 marks for use in
College (one academic and
one Union), one for use for
a specific reason at weekends,
ELEPHANT
BUILDINGS?
Last Tuesday Mr. Sharp
continued his series of lec-
tures on the architecture in
London. Most of the lecture
was devoted to showing
slides of buildings in London
and comments upon them.
Mr. Sharp expressed the
opinion that modern architec-
ture began in a zoo (shades
of Dr. Morris). To be precise
in the Penguin Pool in the
zoological gardens. We were
also treated to a view of the
new elephant building which
was supposed to represent
elephants eating.
Mr. Sharp thought that the
number of impersonal blocks
of flats without attendant
facilities was a direct result
of lack of finance and not
lack of ideas. The projection-
ist seemed to be amusing
himself in trying to get one
of the sides the right way up,
this somehow led to the ques-
tion of how high a building
should be. Other treats in-
cluded a shot of the American
Embassy, the design of
which was the result of an
open competition with the
condition that it should be in
keeping, with the other Geor-
gian buildings! We also saw
a shot of the R C A building
on Kensington Gore. Mr.
Sharp thought this was very
well designed and that it
looked as good in the wet as
as in the sun and even better
in the half light of a fog. Un-
fortunately Mr. Philips ex-
pressed no opinion on the
new IC buildings.
and one general mark. RESI-
DENTS places were only
over applied for by a factor
of 2. The reasons for 'the
delay were given as the time
taken to mark the forms, that
is approximately 14 hours
per person, the delay in
checking up whether com-
muters really would save
time or not, the time taken to
send out 700 replies, and de-
lays by administration in get-
ting out the stickers.
Despite the criticism,
Keith Guy has assured ICU
council that the system was
as fair as possible, and Presi-
dent Corbyn expressed the
view that it was a thoughtful
and sensible way of selec-
tion.

JAZZ SESSION
On the Sunday evening be-
fore last, IC Jazz club showed
its face to the world for the
I \ 11
iiiiiii^
One of Photsocs. modelsfromtheir portrait
session on Tuesday, October 14th.
THE SIMON SOCIETY
12.20 a.m. The scene —
Waterloo. A woman, in her
forties, lies in the gutter. The
ambulance men recognise her,
she has been picked up by
them many times before. Her
disease?—alcohol ism.
2.00 a.m. The scene — a
paper factory near Covent
Garden. On this cold night
five old men sleep on the
pavement next to the hot air
exhausts of the factory.
These are the types of
people that the Simon Com-
munity are trying to help.
These are the people who, for
circumstances beyond their
control, have fallen through
the net of the Welfare State.
The Community operates a
house in Kentish Town where
they attempt to give social
dropouts an opportunity to
regain their self-respect.
Simon reaches these people
through its soup runs.
The procedure is this — a
group of students in a van go
to Simon HQ and collect the
soup and bread. They then
drive round to places such as
Covent Garden and Charing
Cross, offering soup, conver-
sation and a little humanity
to these temps.
I propose to set up a base
for this scheme at IC. Simon
provides ithe soup, the college
provide the van, all we need
is YOU to help distribute the
food in the early hours of the
morning. If you are interested
in providing a service for
those people forgotten by the
State, then please contact me
via the Union Office or Lin-
stead 434.
BRIAN HAINS
first time at a packed free
session in the Union 'Lounge.
The evening started with
trad jazz from the evergreen
(take that how you like)
Splinter Group, with John
Franklin and Les Webb on
trumpet and clarinet consis-
tently on form, and amongst
the sitters-in Bob Coomhes'
roguish trombone was out-
standing. The familiar num-
bers were put through their
paces, and as ever it was
astonishing to note the fluc-
tuating personnel were all
familiar with the intricacies
of the old arrangements such
as "Hiawatha Rag".
The harmonic basis of the
blues, as played by the next
two groups, is well known—
repetitive, liberally embellish-
ed with olapitonasque cliches,
and rather pretentious, as is
inevitable when well-heeled
young people in uncheap
blues "clobber" and using
good equipment sing of the
frustrations of being penni-
less, and womanless. Their
dollies applauded the heroes,
but many in the audience
found the groups (one from
IC and the other from Brunei)
rather noisy and boring.
An ad-hoc modern jazz
group followed the modern
electric blues with a rather
more interesting Charlie
Minguis item, but then let
themselves down by starting
a number with "My funny
Valentine", shirking the chal-
lenge of a 32 bar ballad, and
ending up as a fairly up-
tempo blues again. The even-
ing finished with a trad^based
jam session, including "Mama
don't allow", in which for
possibly the first time ever at
IC the drum breaks were
played through without fluffs.
Free Sunday evening ses-
sions are continuing through-
out the year, and with several
potentially interesting groups
being formed within the Jazz
and Folk clubs and with a
number of outside people
turning up to play, these
should continue to attract a
large and enthusiastic audi-
ence, as well as an enormous
increase in bar takings.
STUDENT
HOUSE
PROBLEMS
It is now twelve months
since the first I.C. student
house (Mining House) was
opened and about nine
months since the opening of
Bernard Sunley House. Now
that most of the (teething
troubles have been or are
being ironed 'out, life in them
is beginning to take shape.
At a meeting some days
ago Ian Wells, warden of
B.S.H.H., presented the first
year's accounts of his house
and it seems that it will run
adequately on the present
rents for some time yet.
Although a net loss of
around £600 was reported,
£1000 was paid out in rent
during conversions, which
should be provided by the
college, and £200 was wrongly
paid to the G.P.O., to com-
pensate for lack of money in
the coin boxes during the
time when they were not
locked. The G.P.O. has, how-
ever admitted liability for this
and this amount will be re-
turned. Thus a virtual profit
of £600 was made during the
year. Before any undue opti-
mism over rent reductions
prevails however, it must be
pointed out 'that the year did
not contain a long vacation
during which ithe usual rent
has to be paid to the land-
lords but during which room
rents bring an la relatively
small amount.
Thus, apart from heating
costs, rents are as cheap as in
Hall and are likely to remain
so for some time.
The houses seem to have
more character than Hall in
that they are not situated
right on the college site, and
also the pigeon hole-like
structure of iSouthside is ab-
sent. The residents of
B.S.S.H. are now getting to-
gether to form a football
team, a bar football ladder,
and various other communal
activities, and the house will
soon be acquiring a colour
T.V.
On ithe debit side the heat-
ing problems have not yet
been settled, although it is
hoped that all electric sockets
will be wired through slot
meters, so that residents may
use their own fires. The rea-
son for this is that in mul-
tiple rooms 4kW oonvector
fires are fitted. These are
fitted with thermostats, but
never seem to reach 'the cut-
off temperature. Last year
residents used their own elec-
tric fires land an attempt was
made to assess how much
power each had used and
charge accordingly. Although
every possible effort was
made to keep this fair some
anomalies occurred. Wiring
all sockets through meters
will be inherently fairer.
Another problem at pre-
sent is security. During the
past few weeks two thefts
have occurred; one person
losing a radio after a carpen-
ter left his door unlocked
after attending to so repairs
and another person losing £6
from a writing bureau. This
raises the point that it is
normal to issue all mainten-
ance personnel with master
keys when they require
entrance. In a case like this
with the room left unlocked
most insurance policies are
invalid.
Another interesting point is
that in some cases two ad-
joining rooms are linked by
a fire door which must remain
unlocked. If one room is left
locked 'but the other un-
locked it is possible that in-
surance companies would
claim that both rooms are
technically unlocked.
Despite these problems it
appears that in time solutions
will be found and student
houses will establish them-
selves as equals with halls of
residence.

BLUES
CLUB
With dimmed lights and a
receptive audience ithe first
concert presented by the
Blues Club got off to a good
start with an evening with Jo
Ann Kelly. Her distinctive
driving voice and guitar play-
ing soon won the audience of
100 members and guests. Ac-
companied by Bob Hall on
mandolin, 'she sang a varied
selection of songs, including
"The Spider and the Fly,"
and was ably supported by
three college musicians. The
Blues Club hope to stage
several other concerts this
term including one featuring
Mike Cooper. Enquiries
should be made to Tom
Woosnam, Falmouth 117,
Dave Elliott or Andy Hedges,
31 Garden.
November f,th will be chilly
