Undevelopable?
Dear Sir,
Dear Sir,
I was rather disturbed by
the somewhat reactionary
letter of George X in this
week's Felix, concerning the
right of overseas students to
attend British universities. I
consider his views wrong
both on moral and economic
grounds.
It seems to me outmoded
to view the world in terms
of individual nations, each
seeking only its own good.
Rather should we consider
ourselves part of a world
community where each bears
some responsibility to the
other. Our part of the world
is one of the most wealthy
—embarrassingly so in the
face of the widespread
poverty in other parts of the
globe. On moral grounds
alone I would have thought
that we ought to share some
of our resources; one way
of doing this is to invite
overseas students to come
here to be trained in skills
appropriate to alleviating
the problems of their own
countries. If this means that
we can't produce quite as
many British graduates, we

In the far lands of the
North, the long-haired Lef-
ties sat around their great
iron radiators on their plush
beheld in the far distance a
great hall with larger
radiators and plusher plas-
tic. This wondrous vision
was in truth the greatest
vision they had yet beheld.
Noggin-new-beard their
leader spake to them thus:
"let us stake our claim to
this magnificent senior-
common-room, for such was
the name of the Newland,
and the Leftie Thanes re-
plied: "Yeah, let us go
hither. Why should the
Elders of our Marble Halls
have a place away from the
noisy rabble".
So it was agreed by the
men of the Northlands that
they should enter the Halls
of our Elders and establish
themselves there. Then up
spake Nogbad-the-Aix, say-
ing: "Do not the Elders not
desire a place to them-
selves?" "Segregationalist,
youth prejudice!" ranted the
Lefty Thanes.
"After all," continued
Nogbad-the-Aix, "you Lefty
Thanes have places in the
great Halls, where you may
entertain your friends in
private." "True," gasped the
neutral warriors who had to
live away from the great
Halls. "Incidentally, do the
Elders want us in their
Halls?" Persisted Nogbad-
the-Aix. "That is not im-
portant, we of the Left are
always correct; other
opinions are revisionist and
anti-social" chanted the
warriors of the Red Guard
must be prepared to make
this sacrifice. In fact, our
colleges and universities can-
not get enough suitably
qualified candidates to fill
existing engineering and
allied courses so we make
no such sacrifice.
If this argument does not
appeal, then let us argue
the case on economic
grounds. In the long term,
the most efficient way for
this country to raise its
standard of living is to do
all it can to encourage
world trade. One of the ways
of doing this is to train
these people who will in the
end be most effective in
mobilising the resources of
the Third World. Holders
of U.K. passports, the pro-
geny of British Taxpayers,
going to developing countries
on short-term contracts, are
hardly the most appropriate
people to do this, even if
they have been trained at
I.C.

Mr. M. G. Lambert had his fun knocking College Block
in the last issue so can a mere Union employee have a say?
Much, if not all, of what he said is true, but College Block
was only taken over on August 4th in an incomplete condi-
tion. It has taken a lot of hard work to achieve even the
present state so, please, remember this as you queue
Bookshop-wise.
My word, he did have trouble locating the new Book-
shop! It is a great pity that he did not see the large
illuminated sign on the walkway, did not see the two re-
ferences to the shops' location in the previous Felix, did not
look at the Departmental noticeboards and did not look at
the maps put up at the old shop in Beit Building. No wonder
it was such a shock when he got there eventually.
Having got in, he was unable to see the "No Exit" sign
on the door without a handle . . . . and is it surprising that
customers should pass the cash desk (also labelled as Exit)?
This seemed a better idea than that half the stock should
'whooSh' out of the door without being paid for!
Seriously, though, Mr. Lambert made one very good
point — the book recommended to him that morning was
not in stock. At Easter every Department is sent batches of
forms covering every course in the Calendar so that staff
members can make book recommendations. It never ceases
to amaze me that, although some departments go out of their
way to help, others simply do not bother to return a single
recommendation form. In this case, it is quite clear that the
lecturer did not pass his recommendation to me — if he had,
it would have been in stock. All right, I know we've sold
out of some best-sellers, but they'll be in again as soon as
possible !
Yours sincerely,
MARION BASDEN.

And with this classic
declaration, the Lefties of
the North pressed their
claim to the great vision,
causing yet more of the fric-
tion needed between Elders
and youth to feed the great
fires of Cooperation.
Now children, time for
bed, with your lusty little
wench; did I hear you say
you wanted privacy? Well,
fair enough.

of grit particles of typical
size 0.01mm, but also of the
opaque glass globules pre-
dicted by Prof. Tolansky.
However, unlike the single
spherical beads which other
researchers have found, this
consisted of two such beads
joined by a thin glass neck,
with a fine finger of glass
extending from each bead,
diametrically opposite the
neck. It < was probably
formed from the splash of
molten rock produced by a
metoric impact, the drops
solidifying in mid-flight. Dr.
Fielder disagrees with
Professor Tolansky's view
that anything other than
purely spherical beads would
only be produced if the
moon had possessed an
atmosphere at the time. He
said he wanted to have a
chat to Professor Tolansky
about this.
The moon dust was the
finale of a very up to date
talk, well illustrated by
slides, involving mainly Dr.
Fielder's own alaysis of re-
cent photos. Infra-red photo-
graphy shows that the moon
has certain "hot-spots", in
particular the maria and the
younger looking craters. An
analysis of Lunar Orbiter
photos and the recent N.S.A.
multi-coloured geological
maps of the moon seemed
to indicate the presence
of ancient lava flows, thirty
metres thick, over as much
as a few thousand square
miles, occasionally overlaid
by younger flows.
Analytical statistical tech-
niques developed by Dr.
Fielder indicate that over the
whole extent of the Lunar
Dear Sir,
Although many students
at Imperial College may
know about the extension of
Western Avenue through,
and over, Notting Hill and
Paddington, we wonder if
any have given thought to
the use that might be made
of the space underneath this
raised motorway? If the ans-
wer is no, then they join
company with the planners
of the borough and county
councils, who insist that the
space is only suitable either
for car parks or grass !
By deceit and delay both
Kensington and Westminster
councils have avoided facing
up to their responsibilities;
and while in Kensington a
pressure group has been
formed to draw up plans,
and then try to get the coun-
cil to adopt, if not all, then
it least many of their pro-
posals (with undeniable suc-
cess) nothing similar has
been started in Westminster.
We therefore appeal to all
those interested, or just
curious,
1. To take from the Union
office all the literature issued
by the Notting Hill group,
and read it.
2. To contact one of the
undersigned for more details.
3. To attend a meeting at
1 p.m. on 28th October,
when all the facts at present
available will be given; to-
gether with plans for setting
up a pressure group in I.C.
to try and get Westminster
Council to reconsider its
pronouncement that this vast
area is "undevelopable".

I.C. CHOIR
Your first chance to hear
Imperial College choir will
be on October the 23rd,
Commemoration Day. As
an interlude in the worthy,
if not totally absorbing,
business of presenting
associateships we shall be
singing "The Heavens are
Telling" from Haydn's
oratorio "The Creation".
If you can't wait that
long, come and join us now.
The choir is about 200
strong, with more women
than men. The men mostly
come from I.C. and tend to
be basses. The women come
from a wide variety of places
including the music colleges,
the French Institute, Bedford
and even the College of
Estate Management.
We give two major con-
certs a year and a shorter
concert in the summer.
This year we shall be mov-
ing into the Great Hall in the
College Block and adjusting
ourselves to the acoustics.
maria, at least, there are
preferred directions along
which the craters tend to
align, indicating faults on a
large scale. Also over the
indentifiable lava flows
there is a significantly larger
number of craters than in
the adjacent area, up to
twice as many. A convincing
analogy was drawn between
these and terrestrial craters
formed by the collapse of
the lava crust into hollows
left when the molten lava
had flown away. Similarly
the "terraced" crater walls
have their terrestrial equiva-
lents, including small lava
flows down the walls.
Finally Dr. Fielder men-
tioned the latest analysis of
the lunar seismometer re-
The first concert in the
new hall will be on Decem-
ber 10th when we perform
"The Creation", Then, in
the spring, we shall give our
major concert of the year, a
performance of Verdi's
"Requiem".
A choir of 200 and an
orchestra of 80 do not give
performances of major
works like Verdi's
"Requiem" and the Bach
Passions and B minor Mass
without a great deal of
preparation. Choir practices
are every Thursday evening
from 5.30 onwards. The
Orchestra rehearses together
frequently during the last
weeks; then comes the
moment of putting it all to-
gether. Musically this is not
too difficult. But to arrange
that the harpsichord arrives
and is tuned, that the double-
basses can see the conduc-
tor without falling off the
stage, that the second sop-
ranos are sitting together
and not in a long, thin,
wavering line, and that a
replacement is found for the
cellist who is suddenly taken
sick, these things require
hard work and strong nerves.
But when our conductor,
Eric Brown, picks up his
baton to start the perfor-
mance, the pieces have
always, in the past, fallen
into place.
Will the miracle occur
again this year? I don't
know. Why don't you come
and find out on December
5th. Even if all goes well,
there will be a good concert
to listen to. And, after all,
the music is what it is all
about.
suits which indicate that
even the core of the moon
may be fractured and there-
fore no longer molten.
