Who Knees You?
Dennis Taylor Wins Mr. ICWA
Wm
Wm
Dennis Taylor displays his knees
roll his trousers up rather
than drop them, and he was
followed by Nick de Klerk
in striped sports jacket,
neatly pressed shorts and
moronic expression.
Alan Cummings intro-
duced him as something
new in the field of sensual
attraction, a new type of
man, and, incidentally,
delivered a speech which
reached new depths of in-
nuendo and double-entendre.
Last year's Mr. ICWA
Dermdtt Corr appeared to
help Linda Stear count the
votes for each candidate, and
Dennis Taylor was declared
Mr. ICWA 1969-70. The
meeting was then dispersed;
a non-event perhaps, but
entertaining, although it is
doubtful who was enter-
tained the most, the audience
or the contestants.
Scientists and the World
The time for electing Mr.
ICWA came around again
last week, and five happy (?)
members of the male
majority of LC. were
paraded bare-kneed before
most of I.C.'s female con-
tingent.
First in line was Tony
Ranger, who, the audience
was assured, was fully
guaranteed for the rest of
the year. He was followed
by Chris Holden, resplen-
dent in green shorts, string
vest and tail-coat. Dave
Hobden as Chris' proposer
invited members of the
audience to come and feel
his nominee's knees to check
their authenticity,
Steve Buttling, proposing
Dennis Taylor, made a very
telling point in his candi-
date's favour by reminding
the audience of Dennis'
uniqueness in the competi-
tion, all the other entrants
being men. Nevertheless,
Dennis duly dropped his
jeans to disprove this and
reveal his knees, only losing
his composure in the light of
a camera flashgun.
Alan Morris decided to
How much sponsored re-
search goes on in IC, and of
what kind? This was one of
the questions which arose
from a talk given by Mrs.
Hilary Rose, editor of the
"Newsheet" for the British
Society for Social Respon-
sibility in Science, to a group
of students and a few staff
at the College.
The Society was formed in
the 1960's when it was felt
that few scientists were fac-
ing the responsibility of their
work.
Mrs. Rose said that she
respected someone like Lord
Penney, who decided that
his working on the bomb
was a proper and responsible
action, rather than someone
who refused to examine the
effects of their work.
Mrs. Rose told us how,
from a herbicide developed
for agricultural use, a de-
foliant was produced which
is now being used to destroy
crops in Vietnam.
Social scientists have their
work similarly corrupted.
Sociologists working in the
USA on social change found
that their work was CIA
sponsored with a view to
suppressing revolution in
poor countries.
The Society's committee
investigating the effects of
CS gas produced results
slightly different from the
official version. The Estab-
lishment is generally unwill-
ing to give up an established
weapon â€” viable criticism
must come from outside, for
example the British and
American nuclear bomb
authorities once said that
radiation was harmless.
The Society feels that re-
search is not something
which should continue in a
moral vacuum. It should be
related to the best interests
of society.
At UC, a survey had been
conducted into the spon-
sored research there. Mrs.
Rose felt that the same
thing could usefully be done
at IC, and that students
should discuss with staff
what was being done, and
why.
It was decided to hold a
meeting in about a month's
time to discuss the setting
up of a group for Kensing-
ton and Chelsea.
The adjourned Union
meeting, still basking in un-
challenged quoracy, con-
tinued last Thursday and the
400 or so present were not
disappointed in waiting for
Lord Penney's talk on
double discipline. T h e
Rector opened with a quota-
tion from a past master of
Balliol College (Oxford):
" I'm the master of this Col-
lege what I don't know isn't
knowledge"; Lord Penney
then went on to remind his
audience that had he been
Rector some decades ago his
academic power would have
been absolute, and followed
with a threat to dismiss Mr.
Corbyn! The Rector en-
visaged a disciplinary board
consisting of numbers of staff
and students, but pointed out
that there may be some
opposition to the scheme. It
was not, he claimed, neces-
sary to formulate a list of
offences, but rather a pro-
cedural code to deal with
such offences. To illustrate
his position, Lord Penney
produced a copy of a recent
Whitehall report, which ad-
vocated a strict central dis-
ciplinary body for Colleges
of higher education; to this
he was strictly opposed. He
appreciated however that
student views changed from
year to year, and that in im-
plementing the proposals the
college would have to rely
on its own sense of com-
munity,
Turning specifically to the
topic of double discipline,
the Rector was adamant in
his view that stating whether
or not there should be
double discipline ought to be
avoided. Reaffirming his in-
tention that the respon-
sibility for disciline should
be shared by staff and
students, Lord Penney gave
two extreme examples. First
he gave the hypothetical
case of the drunken student
and secondly that of the
student drug peddler, point-
ing out the obvious great
differences between the two.
The Rector reassured his
audience, and himself, that
the serious offence may never
occur, and that each case
coming to his notice would
be considered on its own
merits if and when it
happened. In conclusion, he
repeated his intention that it
was best not to write down
whether there should or
should not be such rules and
took his seat to appreciative
applause.
The President of the
Union then threw the sub-
ject open for questions and
comments. Nick de Klerk
said that the college was not
a community, rather an in-
stitution, and should there-
fore rely solely on the law
of the land. Les Ebdon
claimed that the Rector was
arguing for the most flexible
system and that in such a
system the student represen-
tatives would have little pro-
tection from bureaucracy.
He argued that the law" of
the land was adequate, and
that he openly feared a
vigilante society. Replying
to the floor, the Rector
stated that he was in favour
of student powers, but that
these would not be achieved
overnight. In answer to other
questions, Lord Penney said
that all students on the com-
mittee would have full
powers, and would be elected
to the committee by the
students themselves. He
closed his reply by saying
that he wanted the commit-
tee to make all decisions thus
removing responsibility from
his own shoulders.
Other matters at the meet-
ing included the President's
report, in which he stated
that the new USK Lodgings
Bureau had already been set
up, and that the college
authorities w o u l d give
financial support on a pound
for pound basis. He also
maintained that a letter con-
cerning u n d e r g r a d u a t e
access to the senior common
rooms had been sent to the
Rector, and would be posted
around the college in the
near future, Mr. Corbyn then
informed the meeting of
current negotiations about
the merger of the AA and IC
unions in August '70. A list
of IC representatives on
ULU committees was given
to the meeting; there being
no questions the President
quickly moved on to the
motions.
The first motion concerned
union representation on col-
lege committees and was pro-
posed by Les Ebdon who
openly expressed profound
disappointment with the
Rector's reply. He began by
proposing 5 representatives
to sit on the board of
Studies, claiming that student
representation was essential
to any academic community.
He went on to say that the
growth of commuter univer-
sities, such as IC, presented
problems due to an abun-
dance of students and quoted
the Physics department of IC
as an example. It was be-
cause of these numbers that
participation was essential to
the ethos of a university. Re-
ceiving no opposition, this
first part was passed un-
animously. Mr. Ebdon con-
tinued by proposing the for-
mation of an experimental
IC representative council on
which representatives of all
members of college (includ-
ing technical staff) would sit.
He realised that this was not
so much revolutionary but
would he hoped have a far-
reaching effect. Once more
the motion was passed un-
animously.
The president then pro-
posed that the union should
accept the list of topics put
forward for discussion by the
Quinquennium W o r k i n g
Party. After a few minor
amendments the list was
unanimously accepted. Mr.
Corbyn then appealed for
volunteers from the floor to
assist with the further com-
piling of the report. No more
motions were forthcoming
and following were 4 minor
items of information.
After this the Presdent pro-
mised a motion on double
discipline and closed the
meeting.
