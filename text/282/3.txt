FACE THE FACTS
Dear Sir,
Once again the majority
has suffered from the short-
sighted, well-intentioned ac-
tions of the upholders of
minority rights and demo-
cratic principles. The U.L.U.
Presidents Council decision
to strike racialist landladies
from the U.L. lodgings bur-
eau stands or falls on two
main points; firstly, is the lot
of the coloured student in
London improved? Secondly,
are the landladies concerned
filled with contrition, are
their prejudices dissolved?
The answer to both is a pat-
ently obvious 'no' and yet
the Union 'powers that be'
still continue to defend the
action on the grounds of one
moral principle; that racial
discrimination must be
fought at all times and at
all costs.
Let us look at this moral
principle in terms of hous-
ing. The Race Relations Act
sought to improve, among
other things, the housing
situation of the coloured im-
migrant, but it placed the
landlord in the ironic situ-
ation that he could turn
away the long-haired hippy
in favour of the clean-shaven
white, yet was obliged to
accept the immigrant under
the threat of prosecution if
discrimination could be es-
tablished. We do not need
to be Powellites to recognise
a certain element of en-
croachment on the indivi-
dual's rights. The proposi-
tion that the freedom of the
individual encompasses the
freedom to discriminate may
not be tenable to some but
let us recognise the difference
between negative discrimin-
ation and positive persecu-
tion.
The argument, then, is
that the moral principle con-
cerned, specifically applied
to housing, is not sufficiently
widely held to constitute a
defence for the continuing
lodgings position. Let us also
recognise who is doing the
favour. Landladies who let
rooms to students, in favour
of the more lucrative young
professional type, invariably
do so because they feel a
certain amount of sympathy
for the students' financial
situation. To be told, by the
students she has endeavoured
to help over the years, who
she must let into her own
house, places her in an in-
tolerable position and she
predictably raises two fin-
gers.
We should face the facts;
it is a seller's market; no
matter how impassioned, we
are in no position to dictate
terms. We should admit that
a mistake has been made
and attempt a restoration of
the status quo; re-channel
our idealistic zeal into more
efficient protest with a little
more prior consideration for
the well-being of the com-
munity at large as well as for
the minority for whom we
fight. Racial prejudice is
based on fear and no Gov-
ernment, no University
Union, will dispel that fear
by legislation or intimida-
tion.
Yours,
STUART SENIOR,

CAPITALIST CRISIS
Dear Sir,
To understand the mean-
ing of the motion at the
Union meeting of 9th Octo-
ber concerning the Chairman
of GEC/EE we have to look
at the whole situation of
International Capitalism.
The so-called rationalisa-
ton of EE/GEC is a symp-
tom of the international
crisis of capitalism. As the
crisis deepens and the greed
for profit increases, more and
more attacks are made not
only on the British working
class but on that class on an
international scale.
Witness the events in
France in May 1968, so far
completely unresolved and in
fact insoluble by the bank-
rupt French Bourgoisie; the
near governmental collapse
in Italy as the wave of un-
official strikes continues and
the spreading of these strikes
to so called "stable" West
Germany.
Dear Sir,
I am both worried and
disgusted at the attitudes ex-
pressed by "George X " in
your last edition of Felix.
His arguments are based on
a series of false assumptions
which I shall now attempt to
deal with, one by one.
He argues that there is not
enough room in our univer-
sities for our own students.
In the first place I should
like to point out that many
science and engineering fac-
ulties across the country
have great difficulty in filling
their places with suitable
candidates, even more so
now when so many school-
children are turning their
interests towards the arts
rather than the sciences. Mr.
X has tacitly assumed that
the academic standards of
the universiies have main-
tained parity over the last
few years. Again, this is not
ture. Before the big expan-
son the usual entry require-
ment was three A levels,
now that we have many
more places it is feasible to
The only answer the cap-
italist class has to the crisis
is given at English Electric
â€” more unemployment and
short-time work.
Nor does the Lincoln case
alter the argument; certainly
more work can be given to
reprieve the Lincoln factory
but only at the expense of
the redundancies elsewhere,
which have so far claimed
the jobs of 17,000 workers.
There is no solution to the
crisis, ignoring E n o c h
Powell's hysterical outbursts
and sewer-rat politics, other
than the taking of power by
the working class led by a
revolutionary party built on
a firm foundation of Marxist
theory and united against
the treacherous Wilson gov-
ernment, its accomplices in
the Trade Union bureau-
cracy, and the internation-
alist bankers who support it.
A L A N LAFFERTY.
consider people with only
two A levels. If space were
at a premium, as Mr. X
maintains, the universities
would not have lowered their
standards.
A very important factor
is the grades obtained at the
A level. For example, a stu-
dent with two grade Es
wanting to do mathematics
would not be accepted, not
through any lack of room
on the part of the university,
but through a lack of abil-
ity on the part of the appli-
cant. The UCCA clearing
scheme attempts to place
those candidates with the
" minimum requirements "
into a university. The rea-
son why this is not always
successful is that many uni-
versities are not prepared to
accept students with bare
passes. The minimum re-
quirements of different uni-
versities are in no way uni-
form, another point Mr. X
appears to have overlooked.
Does Britain benefit from
overseas students? I would
say yes. The cross-fertilisa-
tion of ideas that necessarily
ensues in discussion with stu-
dents of different back-
grounds, different ways of
approaching a problem, can
only be of benefit to all con-
cerned. Contact between for-
eign students helps to deve-
lop understanding between
nations and serves to create
a political climate in which
rational discussion can re-
place irrational prejudice.
That British students bene-
fit greatly from their studies
in other countries cannot be
denied, it is surely common
courtesy to extend the same
opportunities to foreign stu-
dents in this country.
Mr. X bemoans the fact
that many overseas students
return to their country on
completion of their studies.
As far as the underdevel-
oped countries are concerned
I would regard the return of
qualified scientists and tech-
nologists as the most prac-
tical form of economic aid
that we can give. For the
developed countries, students
are generally exchanged on
a one-to-one basis, hence the
number of places occupied
remain the same.
I do not accept the con-
tention that eligible Britons
are being denied places.
To return to my example,
a foreign student with two
grade As would be accepted
for a mathematics course,
whereas a British student
with two grade Es would
not. It would clearly be
fatuous for the British stu-
dent to claim that the for-
eign student were occupying
"his" place, if the foreign
student were not there, the
place would be vacant!
In conclusion I should like
to express my distaste that
that George X did not sign
his full name. In my opin-
ion, an anonymous letter to
a newspaper is a form of
intellectual cowardice, and
does not deserve to be
printed.
Yours sincerely,
BRIAN HAINS

H A L D A N E CRITICISED
Dear Felix,
Having served on the so-
called Haldane Library
Union Committee (student)
for one year, I am possessed
of the urge to communicate
my impressions to your read-
ers and particularly Haldane
Library users.
The main (only?) func-
tion of Committee members
is to work once a fortnight
at the Issue desk during the
lunch hour, and in exchange
for this they are bribed;
being allowed to borrow an
unlimited number of books
for an indefinite period! The
student committee has no
say whatsoever in buying
policy and library affairs and
for that matter has no con-
structive role to play at all.
It would make no difference
if this committee were dis-
solved and lunch-time volun-
teers called for! This would
also be a good deal more
honest, as no false expecta-
tions will be aroused in con-
structive/creative types like
me !
Fortunately the boredom
of committee meetings last
year was at least relieved by
the entertainment provided
by the chairman, for which
1 express my gratitude.
KUMAR DAVID.
Elect. Eng.
"George X" Replies:
Dear Sir,
In reply to Mr. Hains'
letter, I must concur in gen-
eral with some of his points.
In my first letter I did not
have the space to give to
exceptions like reciprocal
agreements with other coun-
tries and the fact that some
Universities do not have
enough Science and Techno-
logy applicants. However, in
the specific case of IC, this
is a very difficult College to
gain admittance to and the
engineering departments even
set their own tests to thin
down the candidates, so there
can hardly be a shortage of
applicants !
As for the lowering of
standards, he says that 2 E's
at A level are not good
enough; they are however
2 A levels. The Compen-
dium of Requirements asks
for 2 A levels; if the auth-
orities consider this too low,
they should raise the require-
ments, not add that they
need two grade A's after the
applications have been taken
in! Further, although the
intellectual cross-fertilisation
of ideas could happen, in
practice it does not take
place; overseas students con-
gregate together and find it
necessary to have their own
committee; this is hardly
promoting integration.
I agree that I should have
used my full name, but my
letter was not anonymous
(of unknown name, un-
known authorship) but was
printed under a nom-de-
plume, as no-one would have
known me anyway.
