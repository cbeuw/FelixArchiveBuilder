T.T.
Hockey
The first XI have played three matches so far this term
and have won one very easily and lost the other two nar-
rowly. Although this may not seem a very good start to the
season, the team has played well, and considering the fact
that the sides to whom we have lost have been together
for several years, once we settle down we should do well.
The second, third and fourth XIs have only played one
match each; the second drew their match 1-1, the thirds won
2-0, and the fourths won 6-2.
Unfortunately, the numbers in the club are not suffi-
cient to run the expected five elevens, but the existing teams
have a full fixture list right through 'till the end of next
term.
IC 1st 5 — LONDON HOSPITAL 1
IC soon settled down in this, the first match of the
season, and Pratt scored the first goal after about 10 minutes.
He soon scored again, and Mudan also netted one to make
the score 3-0 in IC's favour at half-time. In the second half
IC scored three more, Pratt completing his hat-trick and
Sargent adding the other. However, the second half was
rather scruffy and London Hospital scrambled a goal late
in the game.
IC 1st 1 — AYLESBURY 1st 2
IC pressed hard in this match and were unlucky not to
score several times in the first half. In the second half, the
play on both sides degenerated into hitting the ball up the
field in the hope that someone might get it, instead of trying
to construct moves. Our only goal came from Sargent, from
a penalty corner.
IC 1st 0 — GUY'S HOSPITAL 2
This was the best of the games to date. IC played much
more as a team, and were beaten through the superior team-
work of Guy's. Several of the Guy's eleven had in fact played
for them for about five years. Both their goals came in the
first half, but in the second IC were unlucky not to score
several times after good work on the right by Manning had
created chances which were squandered by the other for-
wards. Sargent at centre-half, Watson at full-back, and
Townsley in goal all played well.
Team: Townsley; Burtt (Capt.) and Watson; Napier-
Munn, Sargent and Jield; Manning, Mudan, Pratt, Schofield
and Bates.
I.C. A.F.C.
After a rather poor opening to the season in which the
1st X I lost 5-2 at Harlington, one or two changes were made
in the team which went to Woolwich last Wednesday for
the first league game. The result was a 4-2 win for IC which
is quite encouraging, as it is the first win against Woolwich
for three seasons. The very hard pitch made it difficult to
play good football but IC played well under the conditions
and deserved the victory.
By half time IC were leading 1 -0 with a fine opportunist
goal from P. Williey after some hard work by R. Dixon.
Soon into the second half IC went further ahead when P.
Williey turned a good cross from T. McCardle into the net.
IC were easily on top at this stage and with the back four
comfortably containing any Woolwich attack looked set
for a big win. When J. Darley scored from a corner with a
spectacular if somewhat suicidal header, the game seemed
to have been decided. However, Woolwich continued to
attack and a slight defensive error let them in for a well
taken goal, Any chance of IC losing grip on the game was,
however, unlikely after P. Williey scored his third goal from
a J. Kelly centre. Woolwich did in fact score a second goal,
but by then IC were prepared to trot to the final whistle.
Two of the most encouraging features of the game were
the very fine displays given by R. Barby in goal and W.
Smith at wing half, neither of whom seemed to make a mis-
take throughout the game. With plenty of second XI players
pushing for places, the future looks bright for IC football
this season.
Team: R. Barley, P. Worthington, P. Langston, C.
Willcock, J, Darley, W. Smith, J. Kelly, R. Dixon, T.
McCardle, G. Barnard, P. Williey.
Tom McCardle, Capt.
The first ICWA hockey
match played on Saturday,
October 11th, against Queen
Elizabeth College resulted in
a win for IC by 7-3. This is a
very encouraging start to the
season and with such reliable
defence and mobile attack
there should be many similar
results!
Two goals were disallowed;
one because the umpire
thought she may have been
offside. Playing and umpir-
ing at the same time can be
rather difficult! Perhaps I
can take this opportunity of
appealing for a referee. If
anyone knows the rules of
hockey and has some free
time on Wednesdays or Sat-
urdays, the ICWA hockey
team would be grateful for
his or her services.
Few of last year's team
are still here, but there are
many good replacements,
and with a little practice
(and perhaps even some
'training') we should have a
successful year.
Team: J. Buzzard, S. Ed-
wards, J. Allinson, S, Inskip,
M. Lewis, H. Hutchins, A .
Nightingale, S. Thompson,
L. Beynon, M . Paluch.
Rugby
The season has started quite
well for the Rugby Club with
seven teams taking the field
on Saturday and about forty
people training on Monday
evenings.
Mainly through lack of
fitness, the first X V went
down to the College of St.
Mark and St. John, and the
Bedford Wanderers, but I'm
happy to report that Brunei
University were suitably
trounced last Wednesday. As
yet the Ex. 1st have not
played, but the A l X V seem
to have a strong side judg-
ing by their win; even Frank
Ball, the captain, was off
the field having seven stitches
inserted into his head! The
A2 and B l XV's suffered
rather heavily against two
strong Saracen sides, but a
slight mix-up in the match-
ing of fixtures occurred, so
don't lose heart 2 XVs. The
redoubtable A3's (the old
B2) won their first match
of the season in their old
style, with the scrum-half
playing most of the match
without a jersey! Ffagins'
also seem to have some tal-
ent, but the sources are a
well kept secret'
So keep playing good
rugby, boys — remember
that there's a team tor every-
one in IC rugby, whatever
standard you are. And keep
watching the Rugbv Club
noticeboard for teams, an-
nouncements and general
piss-artistry.

Last Saturday week, IC entered 3 teams in the UC
Relay, our first major competition of the season. With the
firm ground conditions, the If mile course round Parlia-
ment Hill Fields was particularly fast this year. Birmingham
University, taking the lead in the second leg, were clear win-
ners, with Borough Road College second and Loughborough
College third,
Apart from a fine run by Norman Morrison, who ran
the fifth fastest leg of the competition (7m. 52s.), our A team
performance was generally disappointing. Tony Carter
finished the first leg in 30th position, Rod Brook moved to
22nd and then Norman pulled up a further ten places. Bob
Jenson, Chris Burden and Barry Dabrowski ran steadily over
the fourth, fifth and sixth legs to give us 15th place at the
finish.
IC B team came 38th and were soundly beaten by the
motley C team (23rd), which included such dubious charac-
ters as A. Deans (ex-IC) and 3 ex-UC men!
The following Wednesday, IC gained a narrow victory
running against UC and Sandhurst at Shealey. Over the
rough, 6 mile course, newcomer Nick Mandeville was first
man home for IC.

Winks to You
The game itself bears no resemblance to the child's
pastime of counters, as so many mis-informed people seem
to think. It has been described as a game requiring more
sophisticated tactics than chess, with the addition of the
employment of skill and experience. However, the players
seen above seem to be more interested in experience than
skill.
Swimming
Prior to this year the
Swimming Club has tended
to be restricted to competi-
tive swimmers and experi-
enced Water Polo players.
Now, however, we are trying
to expand our membership
to include learner and inex-
perienced swimmers and polo
players. This will not only
give us a more sound basis
for teams in the future, but
will also allow us to lower
our subscription. At the be-
ginning of the year the
Swimming Club subscription
was fixed at 30/- per year.
Now, the basic subscription
has been reduced to 10/- per
year with an additional
charge to cover hire of IC
pool. This charge per mem-
ber will depend on the num-
ber of members, but we ex-
pect it to be about 5/-.
To encourage the less pro-
ficient swimmers, we have
restricted swimming training
to the first half hour of each
club practice, we have started
a learners class every Friday;
full details are on the swim-
ming club board in the
Sports Centre.
Last season was one of
mixed success for the club.
IC easily won the U L swim-
ming championships for the
second successive year, and
this year we should have
little difficulty in repeating
our victory. In the UL water-
polo league, IC played well
against the top teams, but
conceded points to weaker
opponents and finished 3rd.
This year with a lot of new
talent we are capable of
winning all three divisions of
the U L league. We will be
This year, in spite of ULU's
protests, IC is again fielding
five table tennis teams, as op-
posed to the two or three
teams run by most other col-
leges. The key factor in our
superfluity of teams is not so
much a proliferation of great
talent but more a steady in-
flow of enthusiastic players
who are keen enough to
come along and play at all
times, and who enjoy the
position of representing their
college in sport.
The fixtures of the club
have fluctuated from zenith
to nadir over the past two
years, with last year's teams
failing to make much of an
impression. However, this
year, I hope, with the help
of my zealous, hard-working
secretary, Arthur Choyce,
and treasurer M , Harrison
and our enthusiastic "pin-
gers" to regain some, if not
all, of the former success of
our illustrious TT club.

After various meetings last
year involving both matches
and practice, the Winks (Tid-
dlywinks) for the uninitiated)
Club has been officially rec-
ognised by RCC.
The club is now running
with a full committee and
the members, both new and
old to the game, appear to
be highly enthusiastic, espec-
ially as we are hoping to take
the Maria Assumpta Winks
team under our wings for
coaching.
Our first fixture has al-
ready been arranged, against
Battersea College of Educa-
tion at Cadogan Court,
where we expect to gain our
first success. More fixtures
are under negotiation, and it
is possible that we might
enter the Prince Philip Silver
Wink competition and play
such opposition as South-
ampton and Cambridge.
However, at the moment
we are suffering from the
RCC ruling which com-
mands us to he. in existence
officially for one year before
we become eligible for a
grant. We have great confi-
dence in weathering this
storm.
The club'r, meetings are
held weekly at 7.30 pm on
Thursdays in Top Refectory
(Union Building) On Tues-
days in Tizard Hall (10 pm
to 12+) there are several
people to be found enjoying
the art of Winks with all
eagerness. On these latter
occasions coffee is the prim-
ary drink instead of the cus-
tomary ale.
testing the realities of our
hopes in our first home fix-
ture against a strong com-
bined London Hospitals
team at the IC pool at 3
pm on Saturday, 1st Novem-
ber. Any support for the
college in this fixture would
be greatly appreciated.
