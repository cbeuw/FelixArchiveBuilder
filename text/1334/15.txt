ners after a term of finding strands
of dinner lady hair in my gravy
and greenflies in the rare piece of
lettuce. I sat down outside on the
school benches whatever the weath-
er munching on stuffed pitta bread
and carrot sticks. It was a happy
existence until I was banned from
the benches for exploding a drink
carton when it was back to gravy
and peas swimming around turkey
dinosaurs. It fitted in with all the
clichés of school dinners that Jamie
Oliver shudders at the thought of.
As far as I was concerned, the only
good thing about school dinners was
the pudding. Prefarably chocolate
cake with chocolate custard. Et sans
les cheveux.
E
veryone has their own
memories of school din-
ners. Whether you went
to a state school where
fish fingers and potato
smilies where plopped on your plate
or Eton where you could expect the
various components of a roast din-
ner complete with mint sauce, it was
hard to avoid them. Just thinking
about it truly takes you back to the
days of lunch queues and being hit
with tennis balls whilst panicking
about the lunch break disappearing
all too quickly.
Personally I gave up on school din-

Ok, so the Main Dining Hall isn’t that bad. Actually I was pleasantly surprised...

MAIN DINING HALL:
4/5
£2.56 Main meal with discount
£1.53 BurgerBar with discount
£1.11 Pudding (pictured below)
Anyway, I’m horribly aware the
food column tends to be awash with
nostalgia and cakes so I thought I
would do something practical for the
Imperial student and enlighten all
of those who have never visited the
Main Dining Hall. It was finally time
to venture out of the SAF with it’s
overpriced and mayonnaise-filled
sandwiches and trek over to the
Sherfield building for what was to be
my first hot meal at Imperial. Sad,
considering I’m in the 2nd year.
Anyway, I sheepishly approached
the counters clutching my tray and
was swept up by a throng of starving
students. Before I knew what was
going on I had to give my order and
pointed to the nearest thing, which
happened to be chicken curry and
rice. I was subsequently then pushed
out the other end. Traumatised I
tried to find hot pudding but was
pointed in three different directions
by staff and eventually had to give
up and paid at the till. It was then
that I realised you had to get a knife
and fork before paying and had a
run-in with a semi security guy ask-
ing if I had paid.
After re-grouping with friends and
sampling their various dishes I was
pleasantly surprised at how nice
each of the options was. Of par-
ticular note was the thai pork strips,
chicken and beef curries, fish and
chips and the salmon slice. Certainly
better than any of the school din-
ners I had previously experienced
anyway.
Although stuffed I had to try the
crumble and custard which I even-
tually discovered randomly in the
Burger Bar. When I asked the lady
behind the bar if I could have cus-
tard with my crumble she nodded
and walked off so I leaned over,
grabbed the ladle and helped myself.
It was just like puddings from back
at school; soggy with custard, sug-
ary and moreish.
Some students complain food on
campus is overpriced and unhealthy
but I challenge you to find a bal-
anced meal off campus for near the
price that doesn’t involve washing
up.
Toad in the Hole (serves 3)
Toad in the hole is a perfect recipe
for cold weather. If you’re a fan of
steaming yorkshire puddings and
sausages this is a match made in
heaven. Serve with 2 veg and gravy.
6-8 sausages
1 pint of milk
2 eggs, roughly beaten
salt and pepper
1 cup of flour
drizzle of vegetable oil
1. To make the batter pour the
milk into a bowl and season with
salt and pepper. Add the eggs and
whisk gently.
2. Slowly add the flour, sifting it
in if you have a sieve. Add it until
the mixture feels less runny which
sounds ridiculous but it’s the best
way to desribe it. Making batter is
all down to experience- the finished
product should be like emulsion
paint but it won’t be the end of the
world if it’s not exact.
3. Leave the batter to stand while
you place the sausages into an oven
tray at least 5cm deep, and drizzle
with a small amount of vegetaable
oil. Cook for 5 minutes.
4. After 5 minutes pull the tray
out slightly and pour the batter into
the hot tray around the sausages.
Close the oven door and cook for 30
minutes until golden brown.
Bruce Bogtrotter’s Cake
(from Roald Dahl’s
Revolting Recipes)
In case it’s been a decade since you
last read Matilda, Bruge Bogtrotter
was the obese glutton who was
forced to eat an entire cake in front
of the whole school. Why don’t you
try the Bogtrotter challenge? I could
only manage 2 pieces....... Have I
mentioned that one serving alone is
more than your recommended daily
intake of saturated fat?
8 oz chocolate
12 tablespoons butter (200g)
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup plain flour
6 eggs, separated, yolks lightly
beaten
for the icing:
200g chocolate
200g double cream
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line
an 8 inch cake pan with wax paper
and butter the bottom and sides of
the paper.
2. Melt the chocolate in a Pyrex
bowl set in a saucepan of simmering
water or in a microwave on low
heat. Mix in the butter and stir until
melted.
3. Transfer to a large bowl and add
the sugar, flour, and lightly beaten
egg yolks.
4. Whisk the egg whites until stiff.
Gently fold half of the whites into
the chocolate mixture, blending
thoroughly, then fold in the
remaining whites.
5. Pour the batter into the cake
pan and bake for about 35 minutes.
There will be a thin crust on top
of the cake, and if tested with a
toothpick the inside will appear
undercooked (don’t worry, the cake
will get firmer as it cools). Remove
from the oven, and let cool in the
pan on a wire rack.
6. While the cake is cooling, make
the icing. Melt the chocolate with
the cream in a heavy–bottomed
saucepan over lowest heat, stirring
occasionally until the chocolate is
fully melted and blended with the
cream. Remove from heat and let
cool slightly.
7. When it’s cool enough to handle,
remove it from the pan and discard
the wax paper. The cake is prone
to sinking slightly in the middle, so
flip it upside down before icing by
placing a plate on top and carefully
turning over the cake pan and
plate together. Carefully spread the
chocolate icing all over the cake.
