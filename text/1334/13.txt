Oooh - a bit chilly
Look its ice but in the shape of a glass aren’t they clever.
Chloe Child gets to drink out of ice
Wednesday 12 October, after hav-
ing a couple of pre-night out drinks,
some friends and I made our way
to oxford circus. It was not for
the usual cheapskates or candy box
night out; we were off to the very
cool and extremely chilly ICE BAR
on Heddon Street.
We were particularly excited,
not just because it was my mates
birthday or that we already had had
a couple of home made cocktails
(always interesting), but because
the Ice Bar seemed a brilliant place
to go for something different. I did
have the slightest reservation con-
sidering that I was paying £12 to get
into a bar for only 45 minutes.
When paying £12 you always have
to ask, “What do you actually get?”
Well, you get 45 minutes in a room
kept at -5o
C, a silver poncho to keep
you warm and a free drink, which
is drank out of a large ice cube!
Luckily everyone looks the same so
you don’t need to worry how stupid
you might look.
The actual bar is pretty small but
there is a giant ice vodka bottle
that you can stand in and several
ice bricks along the wall engraved
with phrases. The drinks are pretty
expensive, so make the most of your
free one, with vodka being the only
available drink in the bar. The Ice
Bar is a fantastic experience and
I would recommend anyone to go,
just make sure you wear plenty of
layers.

This is me
Well I think introductions are in
order. I am Aaron Mason. I was a
lowly nightlife reporter last year and
have been promoted to the dizzy
heights of editor. When I say pro-
moted I mean bullied. Anyway this
week we have a review from yours
truly on Smoke at Pacha and one
from a lovely blonde lady, on the
Icebar.
Midget plea
As this is my first time as editor I
want to make a plea to anyone who
has any pictures of dwarves, midg-
ets or gnomes. I want one. Even
though I have been told countless
times that gnomes don’t exist and
they are mythical beings I have a
few short words for you, no no no
you are wrong. So if anyone does
have interesting snaps or snippits
of info about the above please email
them in. I wan to start a troupe of
little people who can be my personal
mascots.
Ooooh I forgot we have a new
section in nightlife this year from a
good friend of mine whos an insider
at our delightful union will hopefully
be telling all those funny tails that
happen at our union when it all gets
a bit drunken and teenage fumbley
like being behind the bike sheds.
One final thought if anyone would
like a cheeky little review for me . Or
if they want to write some wasted
comments about anything in gener-
al like the tramp who you chraitably
gave your bear to or the corner shop
bman who gives you free bear for a
look of your breasts. Drop me a line
in a going living stylee.

Pacha
or
Posher?
almost offensive was the sight of
what can only be described as a
beast climbing out of a cab. Why do
some girls not know the rules? Tits
and legs and arms are not accept-
able exposed all at the same time.
I mean, it’s not hard to understand
- if the above rules are forgotten you
end up looking like a cheap hooker
in King’s Cross who charges 50p
and a bunch of grapes for a go. This
particular lady had forgotten these
rules, but to say someone would pay
her for a jump is being generous.
She had one of those bizarre figures
where she was just a ball of lard with
two tree trunks poking out the bot-
How did pacha go from this to this? But look at those breasts.
I decided to try the in house night
at Pacha last Friday. have to say
this was one of my least successful
evenings out.
Having got to Pacha my friend
and I noticed something very pecu-
liar. Those of you who have been to
Pacha will be familiar with the clien-
tele. They are generally quite attrac-
tive and dress up for the occasion.
There is no hint of skank anywhere.
This seemed to be a very different
night to what I was used to. The
first thing I noticed was that there
was an abundance of sportswear. I
wear sportswear to do sport, not to
go to a club. I mean, what is wrong
with the kids of today. I was a lit-
tle taken back by this but I didn’t
judge too much except when the
people in front of me opened their
mouths and shouted on front of the
entrance “One of you go to the shop!
I wana get lashed before I get in
there”. This is perfectly acceptable
if you are a fish wife and it is market
day. The next thing which I found
tom, with knee high black boots on.
This just made her appear as Mrs.
potato head. To top it all off a large
tattoo was present on an incredibly
fleshy arm. Anyway, enough about
the clientele. I think you’ve got the
gist. We never made it into the club
as they were going to charge us £10
each so we decided that if we were
going to pay to go somewhere it
would be to a place where the cus-
tomers don’t look like they cant walk
and talk at the same time because
they’re pushing their many prams of
kids they had when they were 14 and
named Formica or Magenta.
From what I heard the
music was very generic funky house,
the same stuff you get at any “funky
house”. My advice to the manage-
ment would be it is better to have
a club that is open less but has a
better reputation than a club which
is open every week and lets any old
tramps in.

My buxom bar wench!
Drunken Imperialites! Oh, how
amusing they are! Those quiet, rec-
luse, geeky shells are broken off and
abandoned, unleashing intoxicated,
rowdy, horny demonic like beasts,
who don’t really know when to stop.
No they really don’t have you ever
had to listen to them talk about
calculators for three hours.It really
is quite a sight when some out-of-
place, skinny, spotty thing stumbles
up to the bar after one snakebite
(half of which is down their generic
T-shirt) asking for another “snakey
thingy with blackcurranty stuff”.
I’m being slightly cynical and down-
right mean, but, seriously, working
behind the bar in the union has real-
ly opened my eyes to the potential of
our supposedly crap student union.
I mean, I worked on a Friday and
the place was as quiet as a petrified
mute with no hands, but there were
still people puking up on the dance
floor and passing out in the union
office. Maybe I shouldn’t promote
this kind of behaviour; then again
I’m not the one clearing up the sick
(don’t tell anyone I’m meant to), but
more of this kind of partying attitude
is just what we need to spice up our
suppose centre of student life.
I know it’s out there, lurking inside
all of us, geek or not . We just need
to delve deep underneath those dili-
gent, commonsensical exteriors and
find that inner self screaming to
fall over a bollard backwards after
consuming half its body weight in
vodka oh and vomiting down your-
self. Come on - I know you want
to…
