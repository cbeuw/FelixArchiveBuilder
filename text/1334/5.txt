low the advice they have read, igno-
rant to the possibility that it could be
of no benefit to them and could even
be detrimental to their health.
Excluded information such as age,
further medication or ethnicity may
seem superfluous, but with regards
to fitness and health, nothing could
be further from the truth. Ask any
fitness instructor, and they’ll prob-
ably tell you that as you age, your
metabolism slows and becomes less
efficient; in other words, it’s harder
to lose weight and easier to gain fat.
However some studies have report-
ed otherwise. Either way, it seems
age is definitely an important factor.
Further medication and ethnicity
are also too big variables to be left
out of a study result.
This study shows just how impor-
tant the peer-review system is in
science; it gives non-science jour-
nalists and writers an easy way to
decide if a paper is worth reporting
to the general public, which ulti-
mately helps the reader. The system
also stops those papers with dubi-
ous or obscured results from ever
being noticed by searching journal-

As the union careers fair comes
round once again, once the novelty
of free pens and mugs has worn
off, people are reminded that at
the end of every degree employ-
ment looms. As well as weighing
up salaries, holiday time and
bonuses, how about taking time
to consider the company’s impact
on society and the environment?
People cannot have failed to notice
the worldwide shift towards con-
sideration for the environment and
people’s rights. Some of you might
even be wearing your white bands
now or have put out their recycling
bins this morning. While ethics will
play no part in many of the careers
Imperial graduates choose, oth-
ers might want to take the time to
consider the wider implications of
their employment.
Reversing the interview process
– ethical grilling for potential
employers
It is a typical job interview: you
have spent an hour, apprehen-
sively trembling, subject to intense
grilling, and then comes the appar-
ently immensely important end-
of-the-interview question: ‘Have
you got any questions for us?’ The
normal responses include ‘What
career development opportunities
are there?’ or ‘Are there opportuni-
ties to work abroad?’ While these
are important questions, they are
not the only ones that we could
ask. What impact is this company
having on society and the environ-
ment; what are their policies about
reducing their global warming
impact? The simple fact is that you
have the responsibility and power
to ask questions about the social
responsibility of your potential
employer.
Dispelling the myth of ethical
careers
But, I hear you cry, I don’t want to
be working in a dank, dingy base-
ment, in the middle of nowhere, for
very little money and with minimal
career advancement options. In
fact, there are many opportunities
to have a positive impact on peace,
social justice and environmental
sustainability while enjoying a
challenging, influential and finan-
cially viable career. Basically, an
ethical company places humanitar-
ian and environmental concerns
alongside commercial and finan-
cial pressures.
There are ethical careers avail-
able in both the private and public
sectors, in areas such as invest-
ment banking and consultancy,
as well as in traditional non-profit
organisations. You could help
governments achieve non-prolif-
eration of nuclear weapons, com-
panies respond to climate change,
and charities support and build
communities
And that is only naming a few.
Ethical careers – a new trend
The number of companies that
consider themselves ethical, while
at the same time fitting the criteria
for a fulfilling career described
above, is growing in Britain. For
example, solarcentury advertises
its ethical purpose (solar energy)
and ethical business manners,
and is also ranked the 25th fast-
est growing technology company
in Britain (www.solarcentury.
co.uk). This is all-important at a
time when oil prices and concern
over global warming has reached
an all-time high. WhitbyBird is
an engineering consultancy that
has made environmental sustain-
ability a priority (www.whitbybird.
com). The trend is also evident in
the recent increasing function of
Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) departments in companies.
Of course, you are not limited to
a company that terms itself ‘ethi-
cal’; there are many ethical jobs
available embedded within larger
companies. For example, in the
public sector you could contrib-
ute to policies determining social
responsibilities for companies. In
addition, it is in academia where
many of the technologies are first
developed that aid and support
ethical criteria.
So why mention all this now?
It may help to keep ethics in mind
at the Union Careers Fair on the
9th and 10th November. Any organ-
isation affects its surroundings, so
as a potential employee you may
want to consider the nature of that
effect and whether you believe that
it is justified, and there may as a
result be some alternative ques-
tions that you may want to ask at
the fair.
Plus, if the taster provided in
this article has piqued your inter-
est about future career prospects,
then you can wait in eager antici-
pation for the Ethical Careers
Exhibition, which is organised
by the Pugwash Society and
Environmental Society with sup-
port from the Careers Advisory
service and Volunteer Centre. The
fair will provide information about
immediate internships and volun-
teering, as well as graduate jobs,
including skills and qualification
requirements and constructive
ideas for how to meet these.

Ethical careers in science
Y
ou only need to browse
through the daily news-
paper to find an arti-
cle related to health. If
you’re lucky you might
even find a nice glossy supplement
completely dedicated to the newest
diets, the quickest way to lose that
excess fat and the new, updated
line-up of good foods, which will
guarantee you a ‘longer, healthier
life’. Then there’s the ever-increas-
ing band of nasty foods, which will
rot your teeth, give you spots and
turn you into a big, blubbery circle
of lard. It’s all based on scientific
research, so it must be true, right?
Not necessarily. A study published
earlier this year by the University of
Kansas claims that a lot of research
done on the effects of weight loss,
exercise and a combination of both
on general health and fitness of sub-
jects is inaccurate.
According to the study, these
papers fail to report all the vari-
ables of the subjects involved in the
trials. For example, of the reports
scrutinized, 92% failed to report the
use of further medication by sub-
jects, 86% – their ethnicity and 11%
– their age.
Why should we care? The problem
is that a lot of the newspaper arti-
cles, popular health books and all the
common dietary advisory reading
material take their information from
these original papers. Journalists
and writers ‘translate’ the findings
from jargon-loaded scientific papers
to easily accessible informative arti-
cles. This is for the benefit of the
readers, who don’t want to have
to sift through the load of statis-
tics normally found in the original
papers. They just want to know how
that research will affect them, or
what the basic steps to obtain the
(usually) beneficial results reported
from the research are.
The journalists are therefore act-
ing as a sort of interpreter, explain-
ing to the readers why the research
is important to them. Unfortunately,
many of these journalists fail to dis-
sect the papers properly, and simply
take the results as infallible. They
then report these to their read-
ers, who take the information to be
beyond doubt. So they go on to fol-

Trials in the Diet and Exercise
Literature for Weight Loss”.

ists and writers.
However, the biggest lesson you
could take away from this, regard-
less of how accurate or reliable this
study is, is that, at least when it
comes to health and fitness arti-
cles, it’s probably worth reading
around and about the subject at
hand, before making those crucial
lifestyle changes. It might save you
a lot of time and effort, and you
might find some useful information
or even another, better diet or fit-
ness regime.
But if you’ve really paid attention
whilst reading, you’ll probably want
to check out the research paper
in question here, and then decide
whether or not to believe any of
this.
