a pleasure to read.
When I decided to review a Nobel
Prize winning novella by, arguably,
one of the greatest writers of 20th
century English Literature, I found
it a real challenge. There are per-
sons of far greater wisdom and far
deeper insight than yours truly that
have dedicated entire lifetimes in
study and admiration of this novella,
if not the author himself. Therefore,
my criticising Mr Hemingway’s
paramount achievement should be
taken with as much cynicism as
the reader believes I deserve. For,
criticise it, I did. When I re-read
this novella for reviewing purposes,
I emptied my mind of any notions
I had earlier as to the genius of
Ernest Hemingway and the fact
that I had enjoyed this book before.
Firstly, this is indeed a novella – a
very thin read that should take about
two days to tear through for the
average reader. However, a quick
read this is not. It is extremely slow
to get through and remains so even
throughout its ‘climax’. Yet, this is
not a book to be laboured through,
buttobesavoured.Theauthoroffers
the reader gratuitous amounts of
gorgeously selected prose and near
infinite descriptions – all done in a
masterful manner clearly portray-
being that a lot of it is given away
in the title itself and what actually
takes place can be summed up in a
paragraph.
However, this is far from an
unsatisfying read. What the author
has managed to accomplish is to
capture a moment from his imagi-
nation and display it in its entirety
to the world – not unlike a picture or
sculpture, which, I believe, was his
intention. The title, the reader will
notice, could be to a painting. No,
not much happens in this book in
terms of plot, but that’s not the kind
of creation the author (or is it artist,
now?) wanted. The author simply
shows us the status quo – a poor,
old man starving with no prospects
to survive except for a struggle he
probably cannot win; and, in doing
so, he generates a deeper level
of sympathy than any plot driven
narrative could achieve. The read-
er cannot help but be taken into
the hopelessness, perseverance
and blind hope that the protago-
nist embodies; instead of waiting
to see what happens to a distant
character, the reader, in essence,
becomes the old man. This close-
ness to the character is the driving
force behind the storm of emotions
produced when this book is read, as
it certainly was with this reader.
This creation is nothing like an
ordinary piece of literature; it says
nothing but shows us more than
could ever be said. The story goes
nowhere but takes our hearts with it
nonetheless. I believe it was Oscar
Wilde who said, “The only excuse
for making a useless thing is that
one admires it intensely. All art is
quite useless.” This, my fellow read-
ers, is an exquisite read and a work
of art if I’ve ever seen one.

ing his talents and experience. The
written word appears to be carefully
selected to avoid losing the reader’s
interest with an overflow of mean-
ingless imagery; he uses language
as paint yet is careful not to dazzle
us with colour, as it were. The qual-
ity of writing by Mr Hemingway can
never be doubted to be among the
best in modern English; he has an
innate sense of getting the reader
to follow him into the depths of his
mind and see with his eyes – a qual-
ity which many attempt to emulate
today, without success.
The story for this novella is pret-
ty much non-existent; there is an
encounter with a big fish as the Old
Man in question goes fishing one
day and this is a description of that
event. I certainly don’t believe that
warrants the word story. The reason

Dreamer
Of Mice And Men

y 2 pence: tragic,
humorous and well
written; simple in
idea and brilliant in
execution – the ideal
‘light’ literature read that can be
sped through in no time at all.
Throughout the history of
Literature, there has never been
a more quintessentially American
voice than that of John Steinbeck.
His novels, by and large, cover the
theme of poverty and the quest for
the American Dream – the idea of
self-sufficiency, independence and
choice. Perhaps understandable as
he grew up in and was greatly influ-
enced by the Great Depression, his
novels carry a dark undertone of
hopelessness and futility – some-
thing very obvious in this short
novel. His honest style portraying
the true brutality of the economic
disaster of those decades on the
common blue-collar American led
him to, deservedly, win enormous
literary acclaim – including the
Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award
and even the coveted Nobel Prize.
This novella, set during the Great
Depression in America, centres on
the fortunes of two poor farmers on
the road in America searching for
work; the one large, strong and of lit-
tle intelligence and the other smart
and almost fatherly in taking care
of his comrade. They have a dream
– to be able to earn enough to buy
a piece of land for themselves and
work on their own time and terms;
grow what they need to survive
and never have the need to work
another job again. As with most of
Steinbeck’s works this tragic book
is tinted with wit and casual light
heartedness in sharp contrast to the
painfully moving climax the author
presents to the reader. It is a story
about the true meaning of friend-
ship, bitter irony and the failure of
hope that so many experienced in
Middle America during that period.
Steinbeck’s characters are vibrant
and colourful, if a tad one-dimen-
sional, which is to be expected in a
novella as very little time is devoted
to character progression. They are
who and what they are and that
doesn’t change throughout. Yet, his
characters are delightfully believa-
ble, allowing the reader to laugh and
commiserate with them, adding to
the overall strength of the writing.
The conclusion of this novella
does, however, feel a bit rushed,
lacking the near perfect tempo of
the rest of the narrative – perhaps
to add to a sense of urgency and to
catch the reader off guard with its
message. Unfortunately, the author
fails in this aspect, at least with this
reader, and the ending seems too
abrupt, though still powerful enough
to make this more than a satisfying
read.
Steinbeck’s book is far from per-
fect, but it brings to heart a type of
humanity that is very hard to find
in other books – the prospects faced
by his protagonists never seem to
be impossible or fantastic, but only
too real. It isn’t a monument to the
American spirit nor is it inspiration-
al, but it is what every person out
there can relate to. This realism is
the reason readers such as I return
to this piece of literature every year
or so – to remember that some-
times, dreams don’t come true.

no matter what sort of loud mouthed,
pretentious self righteous do-gooder
you are, let’s make sure that while
on firms or meeting future employ-
ers, you always look good. To keep
your budget cheap buy a few pairs
of smart black and grey trousers
(Topshop have a range from £18 with
student discount). Make sure that
the trousers have a crease down
the middle and aren’t tight on the
thighs and bottom. For those who
are short, do not buy bootcut trou-
sers as they make you look like a
midget. Instead, buy straight leg-
ged trousers and wear shoes with
a slight heel to give added height.
However, if you’re vertically gifted,
wear trousers that slightly flair out
at the bottom so you avoid look-
ing like you’re on stilts. Team these
smart trousers with simple figure
hugging tops, think v-necks for those
who are less well endowed (and
maybe a wonderbra with chicken
fillets, let’s be honest there’s prob-
ably going to be a fit older year
student!) For those with ample
bosoms remember not to wear
high necked tops as this makes
your torso look rectangular. This
Autumn sees the return of the skirt
suit - although the model opposite
looks great, not all of us are 6ft, so
only those with long calves should
do this look. To make your outfit
completely unique, don’t forget
to accessorize. There are many
shops selling beautiful broaches,
earrings and necklaces that can
easily turn the most plain black
suit, into a chic fashion statement
Vogue would be proud of!
For men standard attire is of
course the suit. But when you

more than a month, one suit and a
white shirt can get a little boring.
My lovely male housemates have
informed me that a boy needs to
have one classic suit, with a few
striking ties and one tailor - made
white shirt. However, this may
cost in the range of £500, but I’m
assured that this is an investment
for life. Alas, for those of you who
have spent the student loan and the
bank of mum and dad is unavailable
- then Next, Topman and M&S do an
affordable range of smart trousers,
shirts and ties. But don’t forget that
the charity shops in South Ken are
full of business mens designer suits,
the only snag is that they might not
fit, so start looking now!
