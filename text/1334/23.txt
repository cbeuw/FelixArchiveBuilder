As usual, here’s some pretty pic-
tures and some questions to answer.
There’s an incredible two points for

I’ve been looking for freedom
Another week of Coﬀee Break, but with a special prize to give away...
I’ve been looking for freedom

with David Hasselhoff
Despite being a bit preachy some-
times, South Park is as funny as
ever. That’s mainly Cartman though.
When did the show begin?
Win a bag full of Gay Porn!
This week we’ve been cleaning
out and polishing off the Felix
office, and were delighted to find
a sack, filled to the rim with spec-
tacularly hardcore gay pornog-
raphy. Now, as much as we’d like
to keep it to ourselves, the office
already has our junk crammed
into every possible orifice as it is,
and so we’re going to be giving it
away to one of our lucky readers.
To win, just tell us what you’d
like to do with it. Best answer
wins, and we’ve got some ideas
for you here.
Over 18’s only please!
The offending material, a bag full of
VHS tapes.
You could always give away the
world’s worst Christmas present...
And if you’re ever feeling lonely,
Gay Porn will never leave you...
Or you could just have a wank. The
decision - is yours!
Stop... Hammertime!
Here at Coffee Break we like to
champion the cause of unsung tal-
ents.
In the music business several art-
ists stand out above the rest. Dylan,
The Beatles, Radiohead, they’ve all
changed music for the better.
And then we have these losers.
Tell us the artist and song we’ve
taken the following lyrics from.
There’s two points for each correct
answer.
1. ‘Dance to this and you’re gonna
get thinner / Move, slide your rump
/ Just for a minute / let’s all do the
bump / bump bump bump’
2. ‘Leave the house / Leave the car /
Leave the bad men where they are /
I leave a few shells in my gun / and
its got me staring at the sun’
3. ‘Deadly - when I play a dope
melody / Anything less than the best
is a felony’
4. ‘Girl, I know you really love me /
You just don’t realize / You’ve never
been there before / It’s only your
first time’
5. ‘Don’t you worry! / Its gonna be
alright / ‘cause I’m always ready, / I
won’t let you out of my sight.’
6. ‘When the rainy days are dying, /
Gotta keep on, keep on trying / All
the bees and birds are flying / Ah-
ahh-ahhhhh’
7. ‘“Just let go of my leg” / She says
“you’re the perfect lover” / I said “I
cant go no futher” / Then I flip back
the cover / Oh my God, a rubber...’
8. ‘Michael, we’re not going to fight
about this, okay. / Paul, I think I told
you, i’m a lover not a fighter / I’ve
heard it all before, Michael / she told
me that i’m her forever lover, you
know, don’t you remember?’

Coffee Break can never be accussed

is yet another worst day of my life.
Who does Jack spend most of his

The Sopranos is the best show on
the telly, full of good stuff like mur-

have died in the show?
5
A masterclass in drama, comedy and
surrealism (dream sequences?!),
Neighbours recently celebrated its
anniversary - how many years?
8
The Office is one of the funniest
comedies in years, and even though
Gervais is smug arsehole, we still
love it. Where is it set?
3
A bunch of gorgeous people (and a
fat chap) on a lovely island, and all
they do is moan. How many people
survived the plane crash in Lost?
6
Now The Simpsons is a bit shit,
we have to settle for this show. It’s
not so bad though, the dog’s funny.
Where is Family Guy set?
9
This is Art Attack! Socks are mon-
sters, the sea is glitter, and papier-
