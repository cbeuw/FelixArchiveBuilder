between the terms ‘asylum seek-
ers, immigrants and foreigners’, if I
did I apologise. I am fully aware of
the differences but my point holds
true for all, if they are not British
citizens, why should the British
tax payer pay for them to sit in a
prison cell? I also felt I made it very
clear that I was fully aware of the
consequences for some people if
they were deported; I said that if
they really were being terrorised
in their own country they would be
more careful not to break the law
because they would have so much
to lose.
I am not talking about someone
being caught speeding here but
things like human trafficking, rape
and beating women are fairly major
crimes and, to me, they suggest
that the people who do them are
not very nice and can probably
look after themselves in a country
that is less friendly and welcoming
than Britain. Likewise, if they are
a terrorist from a rather extreme
country I would not suggest they
are sent back to their own country
because they might be free to com-
mit more atrocious acts against
Britain later on.
He also said that I had a ‘loose
grip’ on the asylum figures in
Britain, it is wonderfully true what
you can prove with figures, for
example I can prove that there are
more new asylum seekers applying
each year than there are failed asy-
lum seekers being deported (mainly
because the Government can’t
catch them), therefore the number
in Britain is increasing and I feel
this shouldn’t be the case.
And in that final sentence we
have the crux of the matter; ‘I
feel’; it is my opinion. I love Britain
but frankly I want to emigrate to
Australia because I am so fed up
of the political situation in this
country. I freely admit what I am
and do; I vote conservative because
1) I don’t like the amount of tax I
have to pay, 2) I hate Tony Blair and
3) I want to go fox hunting again.
Alex, in my opinion, is a liberal,
world saving do-gooder whereas
I think that we, in Britain, have to
look after our own interests first
and make sure that everything is
sorted in our own country before
we go to save everyone else.
I don’t want to cut all
communication to the rest of
the world (I’m not a communist,
far from it) but I think it’s more
important to sort out things like
the NHS and the failing education
system than piss off the entire
Middle East. No other country is
so obsessed with correcting all the
wrongs in the world as us; America
only does it because it is to their
own advantage. What is perhaps
even worse is the fact that we don’t
actually try to save everyone, at
least then we would be consistent.
When thousands of people in
Zimbabwe were being terrorised
by Robert Mugabe, no one lifted a
finger to stop it because they were
all too scared of being called racist,
ex colonials trying to reclaim their
lost empire.
I know that to Alex all of this will
make me seem stupid, insular and
unaware of the political situation in
the world - but that is his opinion.
Bring me political revival
The almost
guaranteed
failure of the
policy to thwart
a terrorist attack
nulliﬁes the

This isn’t school
Although the rationale for intro-
ducing the ruling that forces stu-
dents to display their swipe card
at all times is understandable, the
almost guaranteed failure of the
policy to thwart a potential terrorist
attack nullifies the exercise. For the
policy to fulfil its objective, Security
Officers would need to be stationed
at every single entrance to campus,
which would drain College’s already
stretched resources.
If a potential intruder desired
access to College he/she would not
have to do much homework to dis-
cover the public right of way along
Imperial College Road, from which
any building in College is readily
accessible.
It looks likely that the only thing
the dress code will achieve is to
get students riled. Most freshers
arriving at university are elated at
being able to throw off the shackles
of imposed dress codes and start
expressing themselves through
the way they dress. It looks like
Imperial College does not believe
in freedom of expression through
dress.
The success or failure of this
directive is in the hands of the stu-
dent body. If the students decide on
mass to flout these new rules, the
College will have to back down and
have a re-think. There is no way
that they can forcibly remove all
students from campus.

reetings from the salubri-
ous land of Ottershaw,
home to St Peter’s hospi-
tal, replete with the uglier
members of the St George’s cohort,
and not much else! True geeks may
recognise the comedy value of the
aforementioned depravity; it hosts
none other than the award-win-
ning computer games purveyor,
Electronic Arts, vast leafy woodland
and a motorway to slit your neck
on.
The nearest watering hole is
over three miles away, in leafy
Addlestone along with a Tesco and
a series of kebab and chicken shops
for entertainment. Thankfully the
men at these shops are courteous
in their interactions – none of that
faux-Bollywood singing malarkey
our decidedly raucous friends on
North End Road’s now-defunct
Lillee Pizza and Fried Chicken
have been known to do on occasion!
The pointless month in hospital
in my second year brought me to
their attention – and I had to start
using the 190 in order to avoid the
refrain of ‘hey Indian girl. You got
pretty eyes’ and similarly pathetic
ministrations!
Regretfully, St Peter’s is distinctly
lacking on the Hospital Watch
front. The male nursing students
from Surrey Polytechnic are
best described as cousins of the
repulsive Craig from Malcolm
in the Middle and the Simpsons’
Comic Book guy, without so much
as a sense of humour to make them
attractive. St George’s men are an
improvement, since they’ve been
generous enough to invite us out to
a couple of parties, but ten G&T’s
later the lack of medical knowledge
between them meant only one
thing: that things in the sack
weren’t going to be great.
This leaves only one thing – the
doctors. Paediatrics is a speciality
known to attract the geekier,
slightly weedy types. So we’ve got
ten pairs of glasses worn by ten
Indian men the size of my left arm
and a fundamentalist Christian
from China. The consultants fare
slightly better, with Thunderbird
getting a sizeable edge over Baldy
since he doesn’t own a disdainful
mouth or a Mr Burns’ haircut.
Since Thunderbird is the only one
in shape, with a full head of hair,
many a tutorial has been spent
listening to his authoritative voice
dreaming of what could be in a
master-slave situation. I’d quite like
to take him to a Chelsea dungeon,
though quite what his country
mare of a wife would make of that,
I don’t know - I guess we’ll have
to make do with the play-piercing
opportunities the acupuncture
needles in the neonatal unit afford
In reply to Alex Guite’s ‘Things
could be worse than missing
Neighbours’ (which I don’t think is
true at all), I have the following to
say; firstly I did not actually call the
column, ‘I should write for the daily
mail’, that was the Felix’s editor
idea and in doing so, I feel, he gave
the column racist and xenophobic
overturns which were not intended.
That is only incidental though,
there are many more points I would
like to clarify for Alex (notice I use
your first name, not ‘Guite’ because
I do not like too appear conde-
scending and rude, even though I
may be both those things).
I did not ‘grudgingly admit’ that
only a very small amount of crime
is committed by asylum seekers,
I made it perfectly clear. Also I
did not feel I ‘loosely swapped’
Stormy Woods
College need to be shown what
the overwhelming student opinion
is on this matter, especially with
regard to the wearing of hoodies
and “offensive dress”. Perhaps if
students all started wearing hood-
ies with swearwords blazoned
across the front, they would see
what a real offensive dress problem
was.
