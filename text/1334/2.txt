“Did you fancy her?

There was potential, and a sec-

Recent studies carried out by the
Campaign Against Arms Trade
(CAAT) have shown that 67 uni-
versities and colleges in the UK
are holding shares in arms com-
panies, often without knowledge or
agreement of those on whose behalf
they invest. A deepening relation-
ship between British universities
and the military industrial sector
in recent years has gone largely
unnoticed by students and lectur-
ers. However, some arms compa-
nies support universities by provid-
ing graduate recruitment, research
deals and sponsorship.
Universities holding the high-
est number of shares include
top universities like Oxford and
Cambridge. CAAT have stated that
Imperial College holds shares in
six UK based arms companies:
BAE Systems, Cobham, GKN,
Rolls Royce, Smiths Group and VT
Group. However, the exact number
of shares could not be ascertained.
Although this cannot be con-
firmed, CAAT believes that the
wealth of many of these universities
lies largely in the number of shares
they hold in these arms companies.
In a CAAT study it also states that
“the notorious wealth of several
Oxbridge colleges rests upon arms
company investments that rival
those of entire universities”.
CAAT was set up in 1974 by a
number of peace organisations with
aims to end government subsidies
and support for arms exports, as
well as exports to countries involved
in an armed conflict or region of
tension.
CAAT has launched a University
Clean Investment Campaign to
target universities supporting the
arms trade and to end their support.
CAAT state that the trade has a dev-
astating effect worldwide, and as
universities are centres of interna-
tionalism and play a unique role in
public life, they should not be party
to it. Students and staff can support
this campaign by passing motions
in student unions and requesting
more information concerning their
institution’s investments. By doing
this, we will truly be able to call our-
selves an international institution.

The results of two of the posi-
tions, Union Council and Equal
Oppurtunities Officer, have yet to
be annouced despite voting hav-
ing closed more than two weeks
ago. Complaints have been made
to the Returning Officer, Sameena
Misbahuddin (Union President),
regarding the conduct of some can-
didates. These elections saw the
largest number of candidates in
recent memory.
Felix has learned that the com-
plaints centre around abuse of e-
mail lists. It is made clear to all
candidates that the abuse of e-mail
lists, such as those held by clubs and
societies, is against the rules.
The Union has held numerous
emergency closed meetings to dis-
cuss how to deal with the situa-
tion. Felix has been specifically pre-
vented from attending any of these
meetings, and the participants have
been warned not to discuss the mat-
ter with Felix.
Felix was reasssured by Ms
Misbahuddin that the matter would
be resolved on Tuesday night and
a full statement would be provided.
However, she now refuses to discuss
the matter with Felix at all, stating
that, “it would be unfair on the indi-
viduals to talk about it because no
decision has been made”.
Hundreds of complaints were filed at
the Southampton University accom-
modation office last week. This fol-
lows a series of issues resulting in
several students either failing to be
allocated the rooms they requested
or being entirely forgotten. Behind
this chaos is the private accommo-
dation company UNITE, claiming
to be “the UK’s leading provider of
value-for-money high-quality accom-
modation services for students and
key-workers.”
UNITE is responsible for privately
letting halls of residence to universi-
ties in 28 cities around the UK and
reported net rental income up 53% at
£29.1m. Despite rent at UNITE halls
in Southampton being advertised
at £69.99 per week, students found
themselves facing an £89.99 fee. A
computerised application system
supposed to simplify the allocation
procedure meant several students
were left sharing single rooms.
At the UNITE halls of residence
in Charlotte Place, students were
confronted with of having to pay
their entire rent for the first term
up-front. This was approximately
£1,400, on top of which a substantial
deposit was requested. Heavy-hand-
ed negotiations from Southampton’s
Union of Students led to the with-
drawal of these excessive financial
demands.
This is UNITE’s second signifi-
cant blunder in Southampton. In
2003, the company failed to ensure
the completion of Orion Point, leav-
ing students staying in hotels. Upon
moving into the halls, a host of
problems was unveiled: incomplete
laundry rooms, leaking showers and
residents trapped in lifts with falling
debris, to name a few.
This academic year, Imperial
College have outsourced accommo-
dation from UNITE. Due to the nec-
essary closure and building works
at Southside which commenced in
July 2005, a two-year lease of Orient
House in Fulham and Piccadilly
Court in Islington was taken up.
Despite transport issues, for which
Unite can be spared the blame, an
array of concerns has been brought
to light by occupants. Hugh Stickley
Mansfield, a re-app at Orient House,
described an appalling lack of laun-
dry facilities, showers that flood the
rooms and the presence of rodents.
The warden Ioannis Fotinopoulos
did not wish to comment when ques-
tioned by Felix and expressed dis-
may at the letter submitted to the
editor by Mr Stickley Mansfield.
Ironically, in November 2004,
UNITE signed a voluntary code of
standards with the National Union
of Students (NUS). NUS vice-presi-
dent of welfare said, “NUS hopes
that this code of standard will tidy
up the way that student accommo-
dation is run and that student com-
plaints of shoddy treatment at the
hands of the accommodation man-
agers will be a thing of the past.”
Michael Olymbios
According to the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), universities, including Imperial College, are
profiting from the misery of war.
