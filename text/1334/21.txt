Jack and Regina @ New Maharaja
blind date felix-blinddate@imperial.ac.uk
From this week onwards Felix will play match-maker and set up two Imperial students in
the hope they’ll ﬁnd love, or at least have a laugh.
Describe your ideal partner?
Blonde, very good looking, long legs, not so clever
that she makes me look stupid, not too easy but
not too hard (to get), dresses well, doesn’t wear too
much make-up, same age or younger. I’m not that
fussy.
What would be your biggest nightmare of a date?
A fat ugly goth munter with a tache and hairy arm-
pits. Wearing an unclean oversized pink lacy thong.
Do you like a roast on Sunday?
I’d prefer one every day, but I’m a religious type of
guy.
Are you allergic to nuts?
What sort?
Any sort?
No, bring ‘em on
Physics or medicine?
Prefer to bone a medic, and then video call her
mother with a clip.
Describe your ideal partner?
Green eyes, dark brown hair, artistic, has money. Fit
body, no hairy arse.
What would be your biggest nightmare of a date?
Hairy arse. Food in his teeth.
Would you sleep with someone on the 1st date?
Depends on his arse (joking). No I wouldn’t.
Are you allergic to nuts?
Not at all
Physics or medicine?
Neither.

Jack’s Verdict
What where your first thoughts when you
saw Regina?
A bit short but on her knees- just the right
height. I thought she was fit and seemed like
a bit of alright. A good laugh and easy to talk
to .
Did you fancy her?
Does the Pope wear a dress? There was
potential, and a second date could easily be on
the cards if she plays hers right.
Did you like the restaurant?
Does Tony Blair bend over for George Bush?
What would you give the date out of 10?
I’d give her one.
Will you be seeing him again?
We haven’t made arrangements yet, but hey
you never know.
And Finally the question everyone wants ask,
did you kiss?
Kiss where? There might have been (wink
wink).
Regina’s Verdict
What where your first thoughts when you
saw Jack?
Fun and far too entertaining.
Did you fancy him?
I’m not sure
What did you think of the meal?
Real nice and very good service.
Will you be seeing him again?
Yeah, why not.
What would you give him out of 10?
An 8.

Looking for love?
Or just a great dinner?
Email felix-blinddate@imperial.ac.uk with a brief
profile or answers to the above intro questions and
we’ll set you up on a date to remember.
Starsign verdict (Sagittarius + Sagittarius): Both fire signs, however that’s where the similarity ends. If these two pair together then there could be a serious power struggle.
