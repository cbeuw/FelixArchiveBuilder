The FTSE 100 index of the UK’s
100 largest companies rose 2%
last Monday as multiple take-over
approaches worth over £24bn sent
share prices in the city to their big-
gest intra-day rise since the dot-com
era. Shares in London rose for five
straight days last week – taking the
index close to its previous highs of
three and a half years ago.
The Spanish mobile operator
Telefonica led the way with a take-
over approach for O2, which values
the UK company at £17.7bn. The
all-cash bid in the form of loans
from Goldman Sachs, Royal Bank
of Scotland and Citigroup is near-
ly twice the £9.4bn that the Dutch
mobile group KPN, offered for O2
last year. The bid is a 22% premium
over O2’s Friday share price and val-
ues the company at 20 times itwws

Telekom was rumoured to make a
counter-bid but subsequently denied
any intention, announcing plans to
cut 32,000 jobs to shore up competi-
tiveness in Germany.
France Telecom’s £26.5bn take-
over of Orange in 2000 was also
financed by debt, and the cost of
interest payments was so great that
the group was forced to issue more
shares shortly after the take-over
in order to pay for it. Some analysts
are concerned that Telefonica will
have too much debt and could find
itself in a similar position if the cost
of borrowing rises. The near-record
loan of £18.5bn reflects the low-cost
and availability of loans, which has

Europe’s fragmented telecoms sec-

to just five across the US, where the
heavily consolidated industry has
experienced four big deals in the
last two years alone.
Vodafone, the world’s larg-
est mobile operator, last week
announced plans to spend £1.35bn,
increasing its stake in South Africa’s
Vodacom to 50 per cent and giving
it access to customers across sub-
equatorial Africa. Vodafone has also
recently completed deals in the key
growth-markets of India, Romania
and the Czech Republic and sold its
lagging Swedish business.
Overseas companies have launched
£67.7bn worth of deals in the UK
so far this year – the highest since
the dotcom boom. Some of the big-
gest names include the bank Abbey
National and the drinks-manufac-
turer Allied Domecq.

O2, the shipping company P&O, the
glass-manufacturer Pilkington and
the construction group Mowlem;
with a combined value of £24bn.
P&O’s exceptionally wide geo-
graphical spread and its recent
restructuring drive, have turned the
world’s fourth largest ports operator
into an attractive take-over target.
DP World is owned by the Dubai
government and is the world’s
number six ports operator, but it
lacks both the world-wide spread
and access to emerging markets
(such as Thailand, Southern China
and India) that P&O enjoys. DP
World has launched a £3.1bn bid
for P&O, in an effort to double its
capacity to 42m container units by
2001. Although P&O’s freight busi-
ness returned a £154m profit last
year, the smaller ferry business lost
£15.4m and would probably be sold
if DP World to secured the group.
Likely counter-bids could come from
Hutchinson Group or AP Moller, the
world’s number one and two port
operators respectively and could
reach £3.5bn.
Pilkington has received a bid worth
£2bn from Japan’s Nippon Sheet
Glass (NSG), who already own a 20%
stake in the group. Many analysts
suggest a figure of £2.6bn as a more
reasonable bid, in view of the fact
that £2bn only values Pilkington at
eight times its earnings. Increasing
the bid may be out of reach for NGS
however, as it would struggle to pay
the interest on the amount of debt
that would be required for such a
manoeuvre.

The current round of Mergers and
Acquisitions (M&A) in the city have
attracted much attention, not least
because they have all been foreign
companies targeting UK companies.
This year, Unocal, the US oil
and gas producer, was the target
of a take-over battle between US
Chevron, and the Chinese oil com-
pany, CNOOC. Chevron acquired
Unocal for less than CNOOC was
prepared to bid, as it became appar-
ent that the US senate was not about
to let a Chinese state-backed com-
pany take over an American com-
pany with substantial oil reserves
in the US.
The UK is renowned as a very
open market, but some politicians
have voiced concern about the ‘sell-
off’ of UK companies. There are
benefits to foreign take-overs, and
some fund managers prefer foreign-
run companies to British compa-
nies, claiming that they display bet-
ter corporate governance. The lure
of UK companies as potential take-
over targets, implies that British
companies are more profitable and
have higher growth potential than
foreign companies.
More deals to follow
Investment banks can charge fees
of between 0.125% and 0.5% of the
value of the deal, and individuals
involved in the Telefonica bid are
expected to net over $50m (£28m) in
bonuses. Their fees have increased
dramatically in recent years, while
the cost of the actual debt to fund
deals has fallen.
In 2005 the average bidder paid
27 times the value of the companies
annual earnings (price to earnings
ratio or P/E), which included a 20%
premium over the target company’s
share price. During the last M&A
cycle, the figures were higher – an
average P/E of 36, including a 25-
40% premium on the share price.
Senior M&A bankers suggest this
implies the current M&A cycle, and
prices of companies, has yet to peak,
and that M&A activity will continue
well into 2006.
Plenty of other companies have
been linked in potential take-over
activity, including Shell and BG, the
gas producer. Rumours of potential
bids have been rife in every industry
sector, as companies continue to
release record third quarter profits
and have large cash reserves.
Pilkington’s share price rose 30p to 157p on news of NSG’s approach.
