Q
uite frankly I really liked
the previous Zorro film,
“The Mask of Zorro”.
So much so, I found no
need for a sequel. After
all, he becomes a hero, he gets the
girl, he gets the horse and Anthony
Hopkins dies. Everyone’s happy.
Unnecessary as “The Legend of
Zorro” is, I was happy with the film
overall.
The film is set ten years after
Alejandro de la Vega (Banderas)
first donned the mask of Zorro
and won the heart of the beautiful
Elena (Zeta-Jones). Now the father,
Alejandro finds that leading his dou-
ble life is far too hazardous and
vows to hang up his cloak. Zorro is
no more.
However, he has become addicted
to the dangers he faced as his alter
ego and when California’s pending
statehood is jeopardised he finds
himself taking action, much to the
displeasure of his wife. So much so in
fact, she files for divorce! Alejandro
is now faced with the decision to
save his beloved country, or save his
marriage.
The plot is strong all the way
through and is also pretty easy to
follow. Just the thing you need after
a hard week of lectures.
Banderas does a good job as the
man in black but Catherine Zeta-
Jones steals the show as the lovely

Elena since she has so many roles
the same film. Not actual different
character roles, but she performs as
“the loving wife”,”worried mother”
etc as well as looking good the whole
way through and getting to kick the
blokes’ asses in some fight scenes.
Whilst on the subject of fight
scenes, I must say they were a bit
sparse for an action film. However
the action scenes they did have
ticked all the right boxes for me.
Just the right length, well choreo-
graphed and also displayed some
originality, including Zorro riding
Tornado along the top of a moving
steam train.
Another aspect of the film I enjoyed
was the lighter, more comical parts
to the film, usually looking at the
relationship found between Zorro
and his horse. These little jokes
made here and there made every-
thing that much more enjoyable as
it does with every film.
Despite these positive things,
there was one feature of the film
that I wasn’t too keen on. This
was the large focus the film had
on Alejandro’s son Joaquin. Some
scenes see him doing damage to the
bad guys with his slingshot, which in
my opinion is taking things just a lit-
tle bit too far. Leaving the grown ups
to do the fighting would have made
the film a lot better and would hon-
estly have made a lot more sense.
All in all, I enjoyed “The Legend
of Zorro” and would recommend it
for someone who doesn’t want to
see a film that makes you think or
question what’s happening. It’s a
good film to see with friends plus
Catherine Zeta-Jones serves as eye
candy for the guys. An unnecessary
sequel, but a good sequel none the
less.
