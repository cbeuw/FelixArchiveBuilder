Stormy Woods about her ailing
lovelife. If its not construction
workers leering at her, its “balding
South Africans” trying to pick
her up on the 72 bus. The poor
girl must have such a hard life,
everyone wants a bit of Stormy
loving, which makes you wonder,
just how attractive the anonymous
Miss Woods is. After all, the
majority of her week is made up of
fending off requests for a “fuck”, so
are we destined to see Stormy in
the latet issue of FHM’s high street
honeys? Well unfortunately not
readers, I have it on good authority
that Stormy Woods is a minger! No
wonder you can’t get a boyfriend
love! Perhaps you should grab a
balding South African while you
can, because let’s face it, things are
only going to get worse over time!

Sporting facilities
Dear Felix,
What do most students want from
the union? “Sporting facilities
that meet up to the standards
of other British Universities”, is
the most common answer I have
heard. Students live a stressful life
at Imperial and most people find
stress relief in Physical activities.
Aikido is a practical accessible to
all martial art that teaches self
defense and leaves plenty of room
for self-improvement.
Situated near Paddington the
Sherman lounge is a space used
by martial arts that require mats,
Aikido being among them. At the
beginning of term, the Sherman
lounge was closed down so that
works could be done to turn it into
a proper dojo. Even if the societies
lost valuable practice time and
some members they were happy
to have better facilities. Recently,
the matted martial arts have been
told that they can not use the
Sherman lounge for the last week
of November and possibly longer.
The reason: another group of
people that have no link to martial
arts have rented the place. Practice
twice a week is very important
for matted martial arts especially
before a long break. In addition the
Aikido society will be particularly
badly affected since they have
gradings in December.
The president, the secretary and
the instructor of the Aikido society
have already tried to resolve the
issue but they have not even been

Extremist at Imperial?
Dear Editor,
I’m writing in response to your
editorial about the group ‘Hizb ut
Tahrir’. The vast majority of IC
students, including myself, know
little about what this organisation is
about and why it warrants a ban, so
I think it might help if Felix gave us
a bit more information about them.
I’ve spent my evening using Google
trying to find out information about
Hizb ut Tahrir. As far as I can see,
Hizb ut Tahrir is a political party
with a revolutionary left-leaning
ideology which seeks to achieve
its aims via non-violent means.
According to GlobalSecurity.org:
“[Hizb ut Tahrir] ... remains a
radical organization. Hizb ut-Tahrir
is not against violence as such. It is
just against the use of violence now.
But they still think jihad (holy war)
is a positive concept. The United
States Government is continuing
to monitor Hizb ut-Tahrir... the
United States has found no clear
ties between Hizb ut-Tahrir and
terrorist activity. Hizb ut-Tahrir
has not been proven to have
involvement in or direct links to any
recent acts of violence or terrorism.
Nor has it been proven to give
financial support to other groups
engaged in terrorism.”
Correct me if I’m wrong, but this
makes Hizb ut Tahrir no worse
than the Communist Party, which
isn’t facing a ban.
The Union should look into this
closely, and I think we at IC should
come to our own decision rather
than following others. So I think we
need to look into the reasons why
the NUS barred the group, and why
the government wants to ban them.
And importantly - are they anti-
Semitic or not? I haven’t been able
to find a definitive answer from my
evening’s web surfing.
If we have proof that the group
has been peddling racial hatred on
campus, then that most certainly
calls for a ban. Besides, surely
even an extremist would agree that
racism is forbidden in Islam - in
which case the organisation ought
to ban itself!
So what I’m saying is; if the Union
is to ban any group, it should be
done for good reasons and the
student body should be informed
about those reasons. Otherwise it’ll
look like the Union is stifling free
speech.

Dear Rupert,
Thursday means one thing, picking
up the latest copy of Felix. And like
every other Thursday there is the
latest drivel from Ash-wannabe
The author of the ‘star’
letter received each

listened too. The people that aim
to use the Sherman lounge would
need to remove the mats, which
given the recent transformation is
not a 5 minutes job, so the Sherman
lounge is probably not the best
place for them.
If the competent authorities
looked into matters like these
rather than ignoring them Imperial
would have facilities that could
meet up to the standards of other
UK Universities even if Imperial
College is in central London.

Felix
Dear Editor,
Felix as we all know is the
newspaper of the students, for the
students. We’re a good fun loving
bunch of people and our tastes
differ tremendously. However, I
think most of us can agree that we
would like something interesting
in our paper. Last week I was
browsing through and there was a
section on Politics and a Business
section... this might be interesting
for some, but I feel that we are all
capable of picking up a (discounted)
copy of the Times or Financial
Times if we want to know about
these issues. These papers are
certainly more up to date, and I feel
that with these sections in Felix,
the paper becomes more boring
than it is already. This is not to
say we can’t have articles about
these if they affect the students. I
have been reading Felix for several
years, and I’m disappointed that it
is no longer holding my attention
for more than a few minutes.
Please make it more interesting!

Rupert Neate replies:
Thanks for your letter. Felix exists
not only to entertain, but also to
give students the opportunity to
have a go at being journalists.
What would hold your attention?
I think we’ve got quite a good
balance of funny and serious stuff;
it’s certainly less serious than
last year. Also, it does seem to be
appealing to the students (we are
printing 500 more copies than last
year).

Hi Guys,
Your breakfast report mentioned
hot baked beans from the JCR.
Can you tell me at what time you
went? I have used the JCR for
breakfast, off and on, for some
eighteen months and have never
found anything to be hotter than
tepid!
Oh and you don’t print the prices
but say it is “all student friendly”.
Mmmm maybe the grants for
students are bigger than we are
lead to beleive...
Regards,
Graham Ford
Hannah Theodorou, Food Editor,
replies:
Dear Graham,
Thankyou for reading my articles
so avidly. Unfortunately I cannot
speak for Ping and Paul so the
matter of whether or not the beans
were served hot is not something
I can resolve. As for prices,
enclosed is the breakfast bar’s
most recent price list. The discount
for students is considerable and,
compared to alternative breakfast
joints, the prices are comparativey
reasonable. By the way, students
no longer recieve grants as
standard any more – funds are
raised through repayble loans.
Look out for my review of the main
dining hall in the upcoming Felix.
Coffee shops
Dear Editor,
What’s with these trendy coffee
shops that litter this city we live
in? I really don’t understand why
people need so many places to buy
something you can make yourself
for practically no cost at all. I
went walking through one part of
this city the other day, doing a bit
of shopping for particular items.
Could I find what I was looking for?
Could I heck – every other shop
was selling “skinny-mocha-chino-
frappa-dabbi-do-das…..with cream
and chocolate sprinkles on top”.
Where I come from, there are
no coffee shops in the village
streets. Go into the nearest town
and there’s still none - people
make their coffee in the morning,
using coffee power, milk and
boiling water. If they love their
coffee enough, they make a lot
and put it all in a flask so as to
drink it throughout the day. Hey, it
beats paying £2+ every time! For
the price of your average coffee-
bar coffee, you can buy enough
ingredients to make many drinks,
exactly the way you like them!
I hear the average cost to the
vendor to make you a ‘coffee’ in
one of these shops is little over 10p.
How much do you pay for them?
£2? £3 sometimes?? You can get a
decent bite to fill a hole in the day
for that price.
It’s also apparently ‘trendy’ to
get this drink as a takeaway, so you
can return to your place of work/
study holding a cup with a logo
blazoned across it, telling everyone
in the room that you just bought a
drink that was vastly overpriced….
and isn’t actually coffee! “Oooh look
at me and my ‘vanilla-decaf-latte-
mocha-medium roast…..with toffee
sprinkles’….aren’t I trendy and
cool?!
Last time I drank out of a paper
cup, I was probably 8 years old.
The dinner ladies didn’t want the
infants to have proper cups or
glasses – we’d end up dropping
them. Nowadays people will pay
out of their noses for the privilege
of having recycled paper (you know
it’s got old toilet roll in it!) touch
their lips as they taste whatever
fancy syrup and sprinkles they have
on their drinks.
So the next time you wish to
order your “skinny-mocha-chino-
frappa-dabbi-do-das…with God
knows what on top”, sit posing in
the window staring at all the folk
you think you’re above in society,
drinking from a paper cup because
the staff don’t trust you to hold a
mug safely…remember that the
owners of the shop are laughing
their bollocks off at you – you might
as well pay to breathe and shit.

Bar Nights
Dear Editor,
It has come to my attention that
Felix are having regular bar nights
for their staff in the union, where
the beer is paid for from Felix’s
coffers.
I was just wondering a) where the
money for this beer is coming from
and b) how the editor intends to
justify this kind of expense on beer
when surely the money could be
being used to improve the facilities
available to writers, subeditors and
future editors in the Felix
office?
Thanks,
A Concerned Student
All at Felix collectively respond:
Felix Bar Nights are essential if we
are to produce a good newspaper.
The Imperial student body, as we
all know, is not a very literate
bunch. It is very hard to build up
a good team of contributors from
a group of people who have a very
heavy study schedule and aren’t
trying to crack into journalism.
This isn’t Cardiff, Cambridge or
York, which have to fend off many
great writers as everyone there
wants to work for the Guardian.
There has to be some incentive
for people to spend hours and
hours toiling away creating your
newspaper. One of those incentives
is the Felix Bar Night. These are
held only about three times a term,
and we have not yet spent over
£200. When you consider that this
is only 10% of the income from one
full page advert, the cost is negible.
If it were not for the hard work
of everyone who contributes to
Felix, we would not attract such
advertising. So in a sense the Felix
contributors are just reaping their
reward for making the paper a
great read.
We do also spend the money
generated through advertising
on facilities – we are currently
paying off a loan, which paid
for our editoral suite and are in
the process of investing in new
computers and a camera. It is not
a question of spending money on
bar nights instead of facilities. If
you believe there is a facility we
are not offering which we could
offer, please get in touch.
