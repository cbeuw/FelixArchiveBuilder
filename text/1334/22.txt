Scorpio (Oct 23rd – Nov 21st)
It’s time to open up
to those around you
about how you truly
feel. This week may be
emotional, but you’ll
come out on top.
Sagittarius (Nov 22nd – Dec 21st)
Patience is key this
week as people
around you test how
far they can push you.
My advice, bite your
tongue, they’re not
worth the hassle!
Capricorn (Dec 22nd – Jan 19th)
Your popularity is
reaching new heights,
people just can’t get
enough of you. But
don’t let it go to your
head, stay grounded…
they’ll love you even more for it!
Aquarius (Jan 20th – Feb 18th)
People feel like you’re
pushing them out of
your life, so make the
effort to show them
you do care. Some-
body with the initial
‘N’ will be good for you.
Pisces (Feb 19th – Mar 20th)
You are beginning to
develop a stronger
sense of self worth,
do not accept second
best. Good things
come to those who
wait, just hang on in there!
Aries (Mar 21st - Apr 20th)
I thought bonfire was
over? So why am I
seeing fireworks be-
tween you and a beau-
tiful admirer? Feeling
a bit flustered? I’m
not surprised! Things are definitely
heating up!! The spark is electric…
we’d better leave you guys to it!
Taurus (Apr 21st - May 21st)
Technology may get
the better of you. The
thing to do is go back
to basics, just to be on
the safe side.
Gemini (May 22nd – Jun 21st)
Uranus occupying
your sign this week,
means cooperation
is much easier to
achieve than previ-
ously, be glad, it may
not last.
Cancer (Jun 22nd – Jul 22nd)
Determination is
always good, but don’t
forget creativity and
imagination- these will
reward you no less.
Leo (Jul 23rd – Aug 22nd)
The best things come
to those who wait. The
stars are helping you
develop a stronger
sense of self worth-
don’t accept 2nd best.
Virgo (Aug 23rd – Sep 22nd)
All that glitters can be
gold! Fate is smiling
at you this week, and
you have the pick of
anything you want, if
only we could all be
so lucky.
Libra (Sept 23rd - Oct 22nd)
Take 5 steps forward
and take 10 steps back
seems to be your aim
this week, sorry to
say things just don’t
seem to be going your
way, don’t fret, it’ll all
be back to normal next week, just
hold on!
Homeward Bound?
Dear Miss C,
I’m a first year physicist and
I’m struggling with university
life. I found it hard settling in
as the people in my halls do not
understand me. I am finding
the workload challenging and
feel there is no-one to turn to.
I’m seriously thinking of leaving
Imperial tomorrow, but do you
think I should stick it out at least
until the end of the term?
Troubled Fresher
Dear Troubled fresher,
I totally sympathise but life isn’t all
that bad and things could be much
much worse. Just take a look at the
headlines in the newspapers every
morning and you’ll start thanking
god that you’ve ended up in
university in the first place!! Uni is
really different from everything that
you’ve known before, so adjusting
is hard. Now I realise that physics
isn’t easy and that their parties
have been so boring in the past that
people have resorted to reading the
books in the room, (why you’d put
yourself through that torture……)
but there are good mates to be
made, you just have to find them.
Latching on to a 2nd/3rd year and
begging for revision notes has also
been known to work in the past. You
seem to have just been unlucky in
your halls, but if you hold out for
just that little bit longer things will
get better. Try getting that little bit
more involved Spend your nights
in the common room, or down the
pub with halls people, give them a
chance to know you, They’ll accept
you, unless of course you do choose
to start attacking them with a chain
saw, that is just never going to be
socially acceptable. The great thing
about uni is that there is such a big
mix of people and everyone is so
different, maybe you just haven’t
found your clique yet? I mean to be
honest IC isn’t really a normal uni,
it’s not what you expect, and we are
all that little bit different but there
is still fun to be had. Hold out for
just that little bit longer, and see
where life takes you. Remember
going home is going backwards and
there’s so much to look forward
to…
How to get a girl in 10 steps...
Dear Miss Confidentiality,
I told my Chinese classmate that
I was cooking for her, so I invited
her at my place next Saturday. I’ve
already set the menu according
to her preferences but the problem
is that there is no living room
in my flat and we must have
dinner in my room. I don’t want
to intimidate her, but I’ve fallen
for her and I’d like the dinner to
be intimate. It’s my first “dinner
date”, so I’m pretty nervous and
don’t know what to do. Any advice?
Feeling Nervous
Dear Feeling Nervous,
To start with, take a deep breath,
IN! Hold, OUT! Feel better?
Now I’m not going to give you the
step by step guide on how to get
a girl into bed, but I will give you
some advice. Firstly don’t stress
too much about the whole having
to eat in your room scenario, not
everyone has lounges. Now I get
that you really like this girl, and
want everything to go perfectly, but
take things slowly and stay relaxed,
If you over plan she’ll think it’s
contrived and may get the wrong
idea, thinking that you’re a creep.
Now I know you want to show her
that you’ve been looking forward
to tonight, and you already have by
cooking her something that you’ll
know she’ll like, now chill!! If you
push her too fast you’ll scare her
away, and that the last thing you
want to do. Make the evening light
hearted. Be charming and funny,
and if you can’t manage that, then
just be the person she agreed to go
out on a date with, that who she’ll
want anyway. Just take it slowly
and show her that its’ her you care
about, not a roll between the sheets,
that’s your best bet! Good luck and
save me some dessert!
What goes around comes around!
Dear Miss C,
I no longer go out of my way to run
over little dogs or cats with my
bike, I don’t fart in crowded lifts
before I get out, & have stopped
making prank phone calls. So, my
question is: how does this whole
Karma thing work? I’ve been
really good for a couple of weeks
now, and it’s been agony! When
do we start seeing some payback?
Seriously, I’m beginning to have
my doubts if it really exists!?
Des Tiny
Dear Des Tiny,
What do you mean you go out of
you way to avoid running over little
dogs? What kind of a sick freak are
you? You’re asking when you’ll get
some payback? Well I think fate’s
being kind enough! Let me clear
this up for you, karma is about
things happening when you least
expect it! Being nice to some poor
innocent animals and not subjecting
the rest of the world to your
repulsive bodily odours then buying
a lottery ticket hoping it’ll pay off
won’t work. You may have a cleaner
aura and so girls will no longer see
you and run away screaming, but I
wouldn’t hold my breath. What goes
around come around? It seems to
me that you have a lot of bad thing
to pay off before anything good is
going to happen! If you’re finding it
that much agony though, my advice,
dig a big big hole and jump in! Stay
there until you see some sense,
then you can rejoin humanity!
Dear Miss Conﬁdentiality...
