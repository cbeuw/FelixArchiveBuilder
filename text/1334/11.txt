Outstanding people fit in at CSFB – and our training and development programs
make sure they continue to make an impact throughout their career with us. Right now
we have opportunities across five divisions, but the closing dates for applications are
approaching fast.
If you’re keen to join us full-time, make sure you don't miss out by getting your application
to us by 18 November 2005 whichever part of our business interests you most.
Alternatively, find out whether a career with CSFB is right for you by applying soon
for one of our internships.
Our Easter Program runs for five days in London and gives first-year students (second-year
if you’re on a four-year course) the chance to spend a day with each of our five key divisions.
Our Summer Program runs for eight to ten weeks in London. It’s your opportunity to get
a more in-depth introduction to the company and is ideal for penultimate-year students
who want to be sure they’re making the right career choice.
The deadlines for applications for internships are:
Easter Program – 16 December 2005
Summer Program – 20 January 2006
