November, but the information does
not seem to have filtered down to
students. In some departments the
notice was forwarded to all staff and
students, but in others it was only
pinned up on obscure noticeboards.
When Felix asked Imperial when
the students would be properly
informed, we were told; “College
notices are distributed widely, not
only to academic departments,
but also to the ICU President and
Permanent Secretary, and we hope
that the Union will work with us to
ensure the students are aware of
College rules”. However, Sameena
Misbahuddin, Union President told
Felix, “It is up to College to enforce
the rules. If there is a health and
safety matter, I will inform the stu-
dents… I certainly won’t be enforc-
ing the hoodies ruling”.
Although, the code is intended for
security purposes, it also includes
caveats on “offensive dress”. The
notice states that “where it is per-
ceived that a particular slogan or
symbol is offensive, the wearing of
such slogans or symbols may be
considered a disciplinary offence
and dealt with accordingly”.
This appears to have very little to
do with thwarting potential terror-
ist attacks on campus and seems

University of Kent takes over at Wye
TheBearmanCommittee’sProposal
is being finalised this month,
bestowing upon the University of
Kent at Canterbury (UKC) the task
of piloting the future of Wye cam-
pus. Now the question students
are asking themselves is no longer
what is happening to the campus,
but why did Imperial ever delve into
the rural Kent countryside?
On the lips of many students is
the question: “What exactly have
Imperial contributed to enhancing
student life in Wye?” Surely the
isolation of the campus should have
been compensated for somehow. An
improved Student Union Building,
or the continuation of more than
one undergraduate course at the
campus, would have been nice.
It is thought that Imperial ought to
have adequately implemented man-
agement of the changes. These crit-
icisms originate from the College’s
lack of action to keep lecturers on
or to appear concerned about their
futures, even though students still
need them after having developed
that fundamental student-teacher
relationship. Communication to
stakeholders over the future of
the campus was also neglected.
Ironically, the College places a
heavy emphasis on the successful
management of such elements in
the Applied Business Management
course, the single undergraduate
degree now running in Wye.
It has been argued that the
College didn’t want to make a state-
ment saying ‘something will be
happening to your campus, but we
don’t know what yet’. However, a
press release was published on the
Imperial website over the summer
holidays, only noticed by a handful
of the more media-attentive stu-
dents.
Imperial College is very punctual
in sending invoices for accommoda-
tion and tuition fees, and demands
punctuality in students’ response.
So it seems peculiar that College
failed to inform students that their
course and department would be
closed down over the following
year.
Aside from the communication
element, students’ perceptions of
the proposals are mixed. Some see
Imperial as tyrants that UKC will be
providing an escape from, whereas
others regret having to part from
Imperial College, although they con-
cede that it may enhance the wel-
fare of student life in Wye. Students
and alumni are hoping that UKC
will actually adopt the campus as
one of its own, rather than dismiss
it as a hindrance and actually place
importance on the undergraduate
teaching of Business Management.
The agricultural component, the
foundation of Wye’s history and tra-
dition, has all but gone. However, in
fairness, Wye College had originally
adapted from being the horticul-
tural Swanley College, so changing
with the times is inherent to the
institution. Does this make it all
right for Imperial to disrobe Wye of
agriculture, or is it entirely different
as Wye College was established in
an altogether more agreeable and
good-natured fashion?
Wye students wonder whether the
College took over the campus in
an authentic venture for growth
and diversification, or whether the
takeover was ever taken seriously.
Will the College actually sustain an
interest once UKC have taken the
reigns, or are they just saying that
they will? And will they actually
communicate the answers to these
questions to Wye students properly,
or will a few geeks who constantly
check the Imperial website tell us
over MSN?

Felix wins award
Science Felix journalist, Zoë
Corbyn, won the runner-up best
student feature writer award
at this year’s Guardian Student
Media Awards. The Awards are
the most presitigous student
media awards in the country with
judges including Channel 4 News
presenter Jon Snow and Piers
Morgan of Daily Mirror fame.
The judges said about Zoë’s
work: “Her writing has lovely
rhythm and showed an excellent
eye for detail. It is also encourag-
ing to see someone with the con-
fidence to pick their own subject.”
I, Science, Felix’s new spin-off
science magazine, was nomi-
nated in the catergory of Best
Student Magazine. Over 400
entries were recieved in this cat-
egory, and the winner was Cardiff
University’s Quench. Cardiff
University did tremendously
well at the awards, also scooping
Newspaper of the Year, and its
editor, James Anthony, won the
Student Journalist of the Year
award.
Zoë paid tribute to last year’s
editors of both Felix and I,
Science: “Dave and Darius were
really encouraging and sup-
portive with the features I wrote.
I,Science was an ambitious new
project and its recognition at the
awards shows people really do
like reading about science.”
Dave Edwards said: “It’s the
first time we’ve had any nomina-
tions for the Guardian awards
in at least 6 years, and possibly
the first time ever, so obviously
we’re very pleased, especially as
I, Science is such a new publica-
tion. I think this shows just how
good Imperial’s student media is
– we’ve got no arts students but
we still produced one of the five
best student magazines in the
UK. Zoë did brilliantly to be voted
runner-up.”
Zoë said: “I loved writing for
the student press because you
have free reign to write about any
subject you want and experiment
with your style. There’s heaps of
interesting stuff going on around
campus. Finding a story that
needs to be told is like finding a
gold nugget – you just want to
polish it up and tell everybody.”
If you want to do as well as Zoë,
why not write for Felix, e-mail
felix@imperial.ac.uk. Zoë gradu-
ated from from Imperial last
year with an MSc in Science
Communication.

share of responsibility for the safety
of the Imperial community – it is for
their benefit.”
Security Officers are already
attempting to enforce the new direc-
tive and have been challenging stu-
dents and staff at various entrances
to College armed with neck chains
to hand out to offending students.
Although most students appear to
be ignoring the ruling, Ceri Davies,
Head of Security at the South
Kensington Campus, told Felix he
thought that “there was no reason
why the ruling would be unenforce-
able [although he] appreciates we
are not a commercial company”. He
believes it will take time and “won’t
be throwing people off campus in
the first few weeks”.
On Tuesday a Felix journalist
overheard a Security Officer in con-
versation with a woman, who was
asked whether she was a student or
member of staff. When she replied
that she was neither and was “just
going to the shop”, the officer just
waved her onto campus. When Felix
informed Mr Davies of this appar-
ent security lapse, we were told the
ruling was being “enforced only
for College buildings and not the
whole campus”. Another Security
Officer said he did not like chal-
lenging students, as he feels he
may be “intimidating” them.
The decision was made by
Imperial’s Management Board, a
select group of eleven Principal
College Officers, on 21 October. This
is the same body which made the
controversial decision to merge the
faculities of Life and Physical sci-
ences (Felix 1333). Both of these
decision were made without
any consultation with
the students or the
Students Union.
Although the
decision was made
nearly three weeks
ago, most of the stu-
dents Felix talked to
were unaware of the
new directive. An
e-mail notice was
sent to all Heads of
Department on 2
to have just been tacked onto the
notice. Felix reporters could not find
any students who recollect seeing
anyone walking around College in
offensive clothing. College skirted
around Felix’s question as to why
they have included this point when
there is not an apparent problem.
They did not say whether or not they
thought there was an offensive dress
problem. Instead a spokesperson
said, “Imperial is a cosmopolitan
and international community and
we have long had protocols against
offensive (racist, sexist, homopho-
bic) language. The College Notice
is a reminder to staff and students
that this exists and also applies to
slogans on clothing”.
In contrast to the usual apathy of
the Imperial student body many are
incensed at what has been described
as “an attack on civil liberties”. A
first-year physicist told Felix, “I
thought I had left uniforms behind
when I left school. Isn’t universi-
ty supposed to be the most liberal
time of your life? Isn’t an imposed
dress code the exact opposite of
liberalism?” The banning of hoodies
and “offensive clothing” seem to be
causing the most annoyance. One
student told Felix: “This isn’t bloody
Bluewater, it’s a university”.
Genteel Imperial College at Wye, soon to become part of the University of Kent.
