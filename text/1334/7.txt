We firmly believe that JPMorgan is about the most challenging
and rewarding career choice a talented graduate could make. We
call it the 360° career precisely because it gives you everything:
intellectual challenges, tangible impact on the business and
substantial rewards. A word of warning though. The deadline for
applications this year is November 27, 2005, so if you don’t visit
360career.com and apply in the very near future, you might never
experience it. Of course, you can’t really miss something you’ve
never had. Can you?
