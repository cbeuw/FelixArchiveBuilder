Joy for ICSM 2nd XI
Mens Football
ICSM 2nd XI 3
Imperial College 3rd XI 1
Jason Adhikaree
IC3’ssecondmeetingwithyetanoth-
er ICSM team this season has pre-
dictably ended with another defeat.
What the IC players lacked in heart
and commitment, they made up
for with unsporting behaviour and
unnecessary verbal abuse. A special
mention must go to the “gentleman”
(if I can call him that) in the number
7 shirt on the IC team. The away
team opened the scoring with their
first attacking move, despite the
Medics dominating most of the first
half. A corner and the subsequent
goalmouth scramble led to IC’s only
goal. With their confidence unjustly
high and their egos boosted, the 3rd
XI’s fall from grace was far more
painful than expected.
The Medics were unable to con-
vert most of their chances into goals
and ironically, the equaliser was
pretty ugly and not exactly typical
of their fluid performance during
the game. A timid cross into the box
was fumbled by the goalkeeper who
dived to the ground with the grace of
a beached whale as the ball slithered
under his considerable waistline for
Vikas, the Medics sharpshooter to
slot home. To put this into perspec-
tive, the goalkeeper looked like Rik
Waller and played football like Rik
Waller. Actually, even Rik Waller
would have prevented the equaliser
from going in.
The Medics carried on with the
same energy and commitment after
the break. Big Stan, the Medics cen-
tre-back put in a sterling perform-
ance to ensure that IC’s chances
on goal in the second half were few
and far between. I think that must
be the most polite way to describe
the awful second half performance
by IC. In the 55th minute, a ball
played from the wing culminated
with Vikas coolly controlling the ball,
turning inside and letting rip with
a 20-yard screamer that hit the top
corner as the medics took the lead
they deserved.
With IC realising that a second
defeat to the Medics was immi-
nent, started to improve their
game although they were unable to
capitalise on their chances. As the
match wore on, they were punished
for their tactical naivety when the
away team started to commit more
men forward. The gaps in the back
line were being frequently exposed
as every Medic counterattack pro-
duced some infuriating near-misses.
Kevin, a fresher, managed to scored
on his debut for ICSM 2nd XI to
make the score 3-1 and put IC out of
their misery, as he collected the ball
on the half way line and ran rings
around the IC defence to slot home
a third goal for the Medics. He had
caused a Mount Everest of problems
for the opposition during the game
with his strength and speed, despite
his relative inexperience of univer-
sity-level football.
IC were rather wasteful in the
last 15 minutes of the game as their
commitment to the cause started to
seep away, as well as their chances
of even scraping through with an
unlikely draw. With a second defeat
to the Medics (they were beaten 4-1
by the ICSM 1st XI on the first day of
the season), the question still stands:
Are IC 3rd XI losing the plot?
Loughborough Beginners is a
massive tournament with 32
teams playing on 3 pitches over
2 days. The games were each 18
minutes long. Indoors each team
has 5 players on the pitch, one of
whom could be experienced. The
experienced players couldn’t score
so the beginners had to work extra
hard.
After a mediocre start and a
very large curry we headed off to
Loughborough’s Union in full cos-
tume (See Picture). Loughborough
union is one of the best in the
country, they have a huge light up
dance floor which kept us dancing
all night. Aki had a go at DJing
which went down a storm on the
dance floor.
The Party Award (a giant disco
ball) went to Brunel who came as
Smurfs and danced from start to
finish.
We got up at 8:00 and were ready
to go but had to wait till 10:40 to play
our first game, against Air Wolf. The
partying had obviously done us good
and netted us our first win of the
tournament.
We needed another win to improve
our position and to keep playing.
We obviously had a good thirst for
disc as we went out and played the
our best game of the tournament to
secure the win.
If the previous game had felt tight,
the last game definitely was. Mental
Discs tried to equalize in the clos-
ing second but Manny laid out and
smashed their hopes.
Disc Doctors came 25th out of
the 32 teams. With so many games
we all came away experienced and
none of us can wait to go back next
year.

Deviants in wet action
For the first time in history, the
DeIViants faced a UCL team.
Unfortunately this also meant we
had to endure the baggage that goes
with playing UCL. As the story goes,
10 intrepid DeIViants and their not
so intrepid captain set off for the
short journey to Surbiton in Surrey
looking for their first victory of the
season. After 2 tubes, 1 mainline
train and a bus journey we had beat-
en the UCL team there (our only vic-
tory of the day) but by the time we
got there the torrential rain made
sure the pitch was in perfect condi-
tion… for a mud wrestling match.
Having lost all our 3 previous
matches without scoring but improv-
ing greatly with each game, the
DeIViants were looking forward to
a good match with our Drag Queen
(Max) in centre midfield acting as
our inspiration, defenders Maria
(Luke) and Kama Suture (Khilan)
holding the back together and our
newly acquired forward Almaher
the target man.
As we entered the pitch, we
released the game wasn’t going to
be pretty as the pitch was about as
clean as the floor of a pub toilet and
just as slippery as well. The game
started well… for UCL, they obvi-
ously eat weetabix over in Gower
Street and they dominated the game
we conceded short corners. This
was our downfall as our defence
were rock solid in open play, how-
ever, after facing Drag Flicks from
Drag Queen in the warm up, our
defenders were a little tentative
when running out to defend the cor-
ner and conceded, twice. With this
in mind, we picked ourselves up and
went on a rampage with Post (Ray)
and Cotton Eye Joe (Alex) troubling
UCL with plenty of runs down the
wings. All of this eventually led to
us being awarded a Short corner
(hurray!) and with the melee that
ensued we scored a goal, our first of
the season from man of the match
Almaher! With the goal the team
were obviously lifted and we started
to play some good hockey.
After a rather diplomatic half time
chat, the DeIViants continued their
tradition of playing much better in
the second half and this time it was
UCL under pressure with us having
got used to the pitch, we started to
dominate play and our erratic cap-
tain (Tim) started to contribute on
the pitch. Drag Queen started to live
up to his name and started dancing
around midfield with the ball set-
ting up numerous attacks. However
against play, UCL scored twice,
owing to slips from our backline
on the increasingly slippery pitch.
Again we responded with 4 short
corners in a row fired in against
UCL, but this time we just couldn’t
bundle it into the goal.
The game finished 4-1, but scoring
our first goal was enough for us, and
we left the pitch fairly happily despite
being drenched and covered in mud.
We were greeted with an excellent
tea from UCL which we were grate-
ful for, and for some (Maria and Slow
On The Uptake) there were girls to
look at afterwards, the rest of us
however realised they had the aver-
age age of the Tanaka building and
steered clear of such jailbait.
