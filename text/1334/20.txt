A
lright there. Welcome to a
new section of Felix! I will
be analysing and dissect-
ing (read: rambling on
about) the week’s enter-
tainment that has been blasted out
of your ‘tellybox’, as the E4 creators
so annoyingly refer to it. If you’ve
got beef with my comments, want
to suggest some programs I should
tune in to, or want to send me fan
mail, you can do so by emailing:

Last Wednesday evening saw the
first episode of HBO’s sex and san-
dals, swords and violence, sex and
rape and sex epic Rome. From the
creators of the excellent Band Of
Brothers, BBC2 were hoping for
great things from Rome. The pro-
gram was a massive success attract-
ing 6.6m viewers, unfortunately one
of whom was me.
Set during the era of Julius
Caesar, it was billed as, “a story
of love and betrayal, masters and
slaves”. However, in reality it felt
more like the BBC were whacking
out some soft-core porno in a bid to
show Channel 5 how it’s really done.
Rome was terrible. Oh, don’t get me
wrong - swords and sheaths, sex
and rape appeal to me as much as
the next guy. But trying to follow the
story was far too much effort, and

Pulled from US television schedules
not once, but twice, it is perhaps sur-
prising to see a Family Guy movie. I
use the term “movie” loosely, as this
90 minute feature went straight to
DVD and is little more than a buffed
up, extended episode. However, this
is a fitting reward for fans who res-
urrected the series buying the DVD
in droves. Why it was pulled from
television in the first place is a mys-
tery, probably due to most American
humour going along the lines of:
<Joey and Monica are chatting.
Enter Ross.>
“Oh man, if Ross finds out I
smashed his car up, he’s gunna be
mad.”
“Err… Joey, Look behind you.”
<Audience “Ooo”s. Ross frowns
whilst retaining his puppy-dog vis-
age>
The Untold Story focuses on the
best character in Family Guy as
it follows the calculating, mega-
lomaniac baby from a near-death
experience, to finding his real father
and finally a bit of time travel. The
journey is merely a changing back-
ground for the writers to unleash
their insane, twisted and controver-
sial humour upon. The jokes come
thick and fast and they push the
boundaries of decency even further
than the series. Joking about every
moral grey area under the sun, or
should that be Peter’s belly, there is
even room to squeeze reference to
incest. As always, there are many
trademark asides that are irrele-
vant to the plot. Highlights include
I couldn’t care less which grunting
Roman got screwed over next. This
wasn’t helped by the fact that UK
viewers get a trimmed down version
of the US show. Three US shows
are streamlined into two of ours.
Unknowingly, the BBC was doing us
a favour. A lot of wasted denarii then,
but the BBC won’t be complaining. I
can only hope that you didn’t have
to suffer the torture of last night’s
episode before reading this.
Thankfully, I only had a ten minute
wait until Lost, so I brushed my
teethandjumpedinbed.Incidentally,
electric toothbrushes are safe – get
one. And speaking of which, doesn’t
it make you wonder how scrubbed
up the survivors manage to keep?
Especially the blonde girl, you know
the one? Oh yes. Ah, Shannon, that’s
it. Blemish free skin and blinding
ivory pegs - I dunno. Ahem, anyway,
what an episode! You’ve probably
seen the next episode last night or
are even two episodes ahead if you
are a naughty E4 viewer. So, I’m
writing for the Sunday crew.
It was Mercutio’s, sorry Michael’s
turn to be centre of attention. We
found out his girlfriend left him and
took his child, but she died when
Walt was 9, giving reason to the
poor father-son relationship. Walt’s
admiration of the bald-one contin-
ued and led to a tussle between
Locke’s lap-dog Boone and a pro-
tective Michael. Later, Walt wan-
dered off into the forest. In true Lost
fashion, we were kept on the edge
of our seats. Ten minutes to go.
Are we going to see the monsters?
Hell yes! But, oh..! It’s another polar
bear? The penultimate scenes were
very tense and torn relationships
were resolved using the Hollywood
struggle-to-success therapy. Were
the writers done there though? Hell
no! The final scene saw the whiny
pregnant one emerge through the
dense undergrowth, smeared in
blood wearing a smile. But, did she
still have a bun in the oven? I didn’t
notice myself, but chums of mine
suggested that was the twist.
Speaking of baking, Thursday was
the night of 24 rip-off Spooks, but
more importantly Gordon Ramsay’s
The F Word. This week he had a
bake-off against him mum. They
were cooking apple puddings. She
was lovely, but Ramsey is even a
cheeky bastard to her. Not that I’d
ever give my Petal jip... To be fair
though, he was very complimentary
to his mum after he had beaten her
2 votes to 1, saying she taught him
everything he knows. Aww. Ramsay
gets a bad press for swearing super-
fluously and being too hard on peo-
ple who can’t cook as well as him.
The F Word portrays him in a good
light and one I think he deserves.
He demands perfection, he is hon-
est and yet knows when he has gone
too far such as when he apologised
to Joan Collins for kicking her out
of his restaurant seven years ago.
For that, he deserves reward and he
is getting it from Channel 4 who are
rightfully airing this program. Watch
it, but I dare you to cook something
from it.
Right, I’d better wrap this up for
this week as I’m off to Battersea
to see flowers blooming in the
night sky. I’ve been keeping one
eye on X-Factor and all I can say
about tonight is I hope the bloody
Conway Sisters get kicked off. The
last thing we need is another bloody
B*Witched clone clogging up the
charts. Westlife are doing a splendid
job, thank you. Not that I have any-
thing against the Irish!
Will I be here next week to write
this page? Or will I be fermenting
in a Guinness barrel? Tune in next
week.

Last week’s TV DVD Reviews
Stewie recalling his failed attempt at
world domination, where he is found
hiding in a box by US infantry and
combed for lice live on TV whilst his
statue is pulled down with chains by
Iraqis. Another very funny aside par-
odies Indiana Jones, where Stewie
is his Chinese side-kick complete
with “Dr Jones” catch phrase.
Almost all of the characters return,
even the squeaky-voiced, greased
up guy who featured in about two
series episodes. This also acts to
alienate first time Family Guy view-
ers. There are plenty of in-jokes and
the humour may be too overwhelm-
ing for 90 minutes. The Untold Story
begins to lag after about an hour, but
it redeems itself for the finale. More
screen-time for Captain Syphilis
himself, Quagmire, would have been
welcome but there is too much of
a good thing. I suppose this is The
Untold Story’s main failing. For fans
of the series, they will feel right at
home, on the sofa in Quahog. But it
is essentially a long episode. Family
Guy is best in short doses and if you
don’t already own the series DVDs,
buy those first.
