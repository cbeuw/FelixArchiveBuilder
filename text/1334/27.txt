were starting to cause AK and co.
trouble at the back. The first chance
then landed to Irvine but his shot
was hit over. At this point the silky
skills of Parrot started to grab a
hold on the game as he started a
mazy run through the all 11 of the
1st team which won a corner. Hideki
was starting to find space on the left
and the midfield pairing of Pricey
and Ant were chomping all over
Louis and JR. A Louis corner then
missed everyone and was curling
in till the intervention of AK on
the line. JR then fizzed a shot that
was turned over by the impressive
Mike. The 2nd’s started to exert
a period of pressure with Gready
working the ball out wide for Hideki
and Parrot to work their stuff. Then
came the best chance of the game
so far as Parrot again beat his man
for skill and slipped the ball through
for DAL. The trap was beaten, but
DAL
’s shot slid agonisingly wide of
the post. Half time came with the
2nd’s tails up and the 1st’s looking
subdued.
The second half started with the
1st team looking to buck their ideas
up, but couldn’t find the killer bit of
inspiration they so craved. The first
chance of the half came towards
Will from a Hideki corner but the
melon-headed one again spurned
the chance when his salmon leap at
the far post failed. With no-nonsense
defending from the seconds, several
stops were required to retrieve balls
for the play to continue. As the game
wore on, the firsts began to push
on further looking for that goal and
as they did so the spaces started to
open up with Parrot starting to cause
the Beef problems with his direct
running. Mid way through the half
the seconds were denied the opener
as again. Parrot fed DAL the ball
who calmly slotted home, only for a
blatant piss-take by the firsts’ lines-
man to give off-side. Again and again
the firsts looked for a way through,

The Merseyside, the Old Firm, the
Milan: three passionately fought
local derbies. However, there is one
fixture in football that surpasses
them all. Imperial firsts against
Imperial seconds. With the demise
of the medics (Ha-ha!) this fixture
now takes precedence in the foot-
ball calendar. In recent years the
rivalry has been well battled out
with the firsts usually gaining the
upper hand. But with the seconds
on a high from their blistering BUSA
form coupled with a couple of com-
mitted and proud, if not fully suc-
cessful, performances in ULU, the
script was asked if he could please
stand up, walk to the window and
throw himself out of it. At stake
were not only 3 points in ULU but
bragging rights for the whole of the
season. This one is not for the faint
hearted.
The game started brightly with
tackles flying in and no-one given
any time on the ball. The firsts were
looking to get forward early and
kill the game quickly. With Irvine
making the runs, T was left to link
up the defence with attack, but with
the imperious moon-faced MacAdie
and the shark-like Milad in defence,
any balls not hit to perfection were
dealt with contempt they deserved.
However the ball started to get out
to Pavel on the left, and his runs

but apart from a half chance that
fell to Irvine they were getting noth-
ing. Then, with just 10 minutes to
go, that script sat up, looked at the
window and climbed up to the win-
dow sill. Man-of-the-match Parrot
and DAL worked the ball across the
pitch and after Hideki had a slight
altercation with Phil Meyer on the
right, he was free to get to the by-
line. The window is now open. He
drove the cross in low where it was
missed by the Beef and DAL slotted
into the back of the net, and out of
the window! A last minute corner
looked to be the firsts’ salvation,
but keeper Mike claimed it to leave
them out of options and out of time.
As the full time whistle sounded,
some seconds laughed, some cried
and some fell flat on their backs hav-
ing been at Fabric until seven that
morning - but they all bragged, and
long will they do so.

Second best!
Old order usurped on derby-day
Last Tuesday saw the rather dra-
matic passing of three times
Cheltenham Gold Cup winner,
Best Mate. Having a heart attack
mid-race is no way for any living
creature to shuffle off this mortal
coil. However was all the collective
national grief expressed through the
media really necessary?
Such mawkish sentimentality
surely dosen’t befit a sport such as
horse racing. Apart from an assort-
ed collection of toffs and oil-rich
Arabs no-one is really interested
in the races themselves. What
we really enjoy is the associated
vices, namely drinking and gam-
bling. Horse racing is unique in the
fact that the profits generated from
it enriches a completely different
industry. Historically the perceived
tawdryness of earning your living as
a book-keeper has prevented horse
owners from getting a serious slice
of the huge profits generated by the
gaming industry. Im sure the wise
investors in the major bookmak-
ers didn’t object to such snobbery.
Outlaw betting and the whole show
is over.
So yes a great horse passed away.
Privately shed a tear if you feel the
need, don’t encourage those in the
media who felt the need to write an
obituary for him. National morn-
ing is cringe-worthy enough when a
major figure in sport, entertainment
or politics dies; it’s even worse when
it is over an animal. Rest in peace
boy, don’t feel too missed.
