who apparently ignores his lack of
interest and leaves him her phone
number anyway.
Once in Elizabethtown, Kentucky,
Drew meets his relatives and is
thrown into a journey of getting to
know his dad with whom he has
become estranged due to his work-
obsession. Having a mother and a
sister who were both coming to grips
with their own loss and a girlfriend
who has dumped him for greener
pastures, Drew calls Claire and the
single phone call soon extends to
what-must-have-been an 8-hour
conversation.
Will they or won’t they? That is the
million-dollar question. As expected
from Cameron Crowe’s film Jerry
Maguire, this film is another one of
those all-men-are-idiots or rather
you-never-appreciate-what-you-
have stories. However, before we
set off condemning the ubiquitous
plot, let’s focus on what set Jerry
Maguire apart from the rest of the
romantic comedies.
Firstly, it isn’t the line “You com-
plete me”. (That’s a ridiculous line, if
you don’t mind me saying.) However,
it wouldn’t be far-fetched to say that
both scripts for Jerry Maguire and
Elizabethtown were both simple
and tastefully done. It’s basically
the mood of the movie that strikes
you. Just like in Jerry Maguire, the
atmosphere in Elizabethtown is
calm, peaceful and slightly melan-
cholic.
Once again, Cameron Crowe dis-
plays his unique taste and ability to
catch the softest and most beauti-
ful of human emotion on camera.
There are numerous scenes in the
H
e started off as an ethe-
real prince from the
land of the elves, only
to be emasculated later
in his stint as Paris in
Troy. This time around, Orlando
Bloom takes the lead in romantic
comedy, Elizabethtown with the
cute and spunky Kirsten Dunst. Will
he or won’t he re-dignify himself in
the hearts of women everywhere?
This was what I wanted to find out.
Orlando Bloom plays the worka-
holic footwear designer, Drew
Baylor. Unfortunately for the young
and upcoming inventor, he has just
lost his company $972 million and
consequently, he lost his job. (Duh!)
He’s all set to kill himself with a
strange stabbing device he created
from his stationary bicycle but his
suicide attempt is postponed tempo-
rarily when he receives the news of
his father’s death.
As he is the eldest son, he is forced
into the responsibility of returning
his father’s body to Oregon from
Kentucky by his mother, Hollie
(Susan Sarandon). On his lonely
plane ride to Kentucky, he encoun-
ters the kooky and neurotic steward-
ess, Claire Colburn (Kirsten Dunst),
Elizabethtown- Hit or snooze?
Despite vitriolic reviews, Felix decides to check it out and here’s our review.
film that truly deserves mentioning.
One of them includes the flashback
scene of Drew as a child, wearing
his father’s shoes. Another artistic
shot was the scene of Drew scatter-
ing his father’s ashes into the river
and by the statue in Oklahoma City.
To be honest, it’s difficult to be a
sceptic in reviewing this film. It’s a
beautiful film and it is disarming to
see how the strong and silent Drew
crumples and collects himself emo-
tionally. It is also particularly touch-
ing and perhaps even otherworldly
ﬁlm film.felix@imperial.ac.uk
to witness the instant connection
of two people who do not; on the
surface have anything in common
at all.
A lot of people might watch this
film and brush it off as another one
of those Hollywood’s attempts to
charm the pounds off our pockets.
However, think about it this way.
Forget Orlando Bloom. It’s just a
story of a man on a journey to over-
come his guilt and loss and when it
seems as if his life is permanently
lost in quicksand, he meets some-
one who pulls him out of it.
Watch Elizabethtown because you
wouldn’t regret it. Take it anyway
you please, be it as a first-date film
or as a touching-artistic film. It’s
one of the rare films that entertains
and soothes you as well. Personally,
I’m a big fan of Orlando Bloom’s
easy smile and pretty brown eyes,
but then again, it’s the story behind
Elizabethtown that takes my breath
away. Not him.
