Imperial 1st XV 18
South Bank 1st XV 11

Whether it was Al Pacino’s words of
encouragement from the film Any
Given Sunday echoing from the bus
radio, or the reading of the ‘The
Tiger who came to Tea’ that was
responsible for rallying the troops
to perform memorably will never be
known. What is certain, however, is
that from the moment the whistle
went to signify the start of play,
Imperial College looked like they
would settle for nothing less than a
win on a rather inclement October
afternoon.
Newcomer Flan(ge) impressed on
his debut with a man of the match
performance, setting the tone by
successfully fielding the kick off and
charging into the thick of the single-
figure-IQ South Bank forwards. The
ball was then excellently cleared
by captain of the day Jim Pedder,
whose decisions in all areas of the
game left little room for improve-
ment, and whose tackling and work
at the breakdown was gladiatorial.
Soon after the lineout, South Bank
were deemed to have illegally used
their hands in the ruck, and a pen-
alty was awarded to Imperial just
outside the 22. Pedder slots it, 3-0 to
Imperial.
South Bank must have been
angered by this great indignity (not
surprising considering they had
enjoyed a run of 31 straight vic-
tories of recent times) and there
then followed a period of late tackles
on Fly-half Pedder and Full-back
Gabs. Imperial were obviously so
intimidated by this, shaking in their
boots so much that they turned over
the South Bank scrum and started
their dominance in this area of the
game that was to last until the final
whistle.
There then followed a sustained
period of pressure by Imperial, with
solid work by Nathan in midfield,
strong defence by Rob Phillipps, and
a good rolling drive off a lineout by
hixxy, who enjoyed another typically
bruising day at the office. With South
Bank now rattled, Imperial again
exerted pressure on the scrum,
and forced a hurried pick up by the
South Bank number 8, who fumbled
and flung it haphazardly to his wing.
Great pressure from Pedder result-
ed in a loose pass to full-back, who
was denied a clearance kick by flan
pulling out a superhero style charge
down, allowing Pedder to touch the
ball down in the goal area.
Soon after the restart, a clearanc
kick was made downfield. The full-
back took his time to gather the ball,
only to look up to see Achi, knife and
fork ready, napkin tucked into shirt,
bearing down on him and licking his
lips with blatant intent of gobbling
up the silly little poser for daring to
step foot inside Fortress Harlington.
They say your life flashes before you
before you die. It would not surprise
me if the poor soul had his, and the
lives of all his relatives and pets,
flash before him in the moments
before his imminent demise. Making
a choice of life over death however,
the full-back escaped by knocking
on the ball, leaving only a very vis-
ible stain in the seat of his neon-
coloured shorts as a reminder of his
brush with fate.
About 25 minutes into the first half,
after a rather artistic reaction by
Nath to at worst a slap, you got the
feeling that South Bank were start-
ing to find their feet, and pushed
up to the IC line. Jovan, dominant
in the set piece, then showed his
worth in open play as he made the
first of his two try saving tackles to
keep the opposition scrum half from
touching down.
Unfortunately, scrum half Rob
Robinson, whose delivery to the line
was excellent in difficult conditions,
was a little too eager to win pos-
session back, and was shown the
yellow card for collecting the ball
from the ruck. Imperial then had a
momentary lapse of concentration
and allowed South Bank to score
cheaply in the corner just before
half time.
With the sun now gone, and new
boy john Gordon on the pitch, the
two teams got set to battle out the
second half. After another crunch-
ing tackle at the kick off by rhino-
man mark wills, who was destructive
throughout the afternoon, Imperial
soon gave away a pointless pen-
alty, allowing South Bank to level the
scores at 8-8 with a good kick from
their fly half. After some good work
by O’Rourke, the elusive Gabs, and a
powerful run by Achi in the midfield,
hooker Luke Taylor was forced to
leave the field after a knock on the
head. Alex Games was then thrown
into the deep end with a lineout 8
metres from the South Bank line.
He rose to the challenge admirably,
and with a perfect throw to John
Gordon, the forwards executed a
textbook drive to the line, with hixxy
scoring a try to put IC back in the
lead. South Bank responded quickly
with 3 points to close the score to
13-11.
The heavens then opened and,
after a few stolen line outs thanks
to the increasingly impressive John
Gordon, Jovan surprised everyone
with his skills by fielding an up and
under, skipping round the opposition
full back, and charging infield. With
top drawer rugby now being pro-
duced by both sides, and good work
in the tight by Dangerous Dave and
Northern Steve, IC found them-
selves defending their line.
After a penalty (which would
have given South Bank the lead)
was reversed for a player stamping
on Flannan’s delicate bits, play was
soon stopped after a big tackle from
O’Rourke caused a South Bank play-
er’s ankle to fall off.
A long wait for the ambulance
then ensued, before the players
returned to the field with a new
weapon on the wing by name of
Obiora Okoye. With the game in the
balance, Imperial took a strangle-
hold on their opposition. Excellent
decisions by Robinson to box kick
down field, tight play from the for-
wards, and solid running from the
backs resulted in IC lineout on the
South Bank 22. After another accu-
rate throw by Alex Games to John
Gordon, it was fitting that Captain
Jim Pedder should round off a fine
performance by finding a gap in the
South Bank defence before putting
Obi over the line for an excellent
try to secure the match. It was an
impressive display by a talented
squad, who now promise much for
the rest of the season.
Solid victory for 1st XV
If one heads through the mist to the
north of the park, following the clip-
clop of prostitutes’ stilettos and the
slap of pimp-glove, they will eventu-
ally reach a small wooden wall. If
they venture closer the outline of a
door emerges, beyond which lies a
shed. This beloved shed, a feat of
early 20th Century, Imperial College
engineering, was once the college’s
squash-courts. Sadly today it still is.
Like Imperial College, squash
breeds strange characters.
Fortunately in recent years there
has only been a handful of men
moulded in our dank shed (although
rumours have circulated concern-
ing a second team).
These “squash players” roam the
College unnoticed, quietly plodding
about their every day business.
The squash elite would not win a
popularity contest, or even a drink-
ing competition - indeed they have
failed to formulate any testosterone
fuelled chants, a standard feature of
all other Imperial teams. They do,
however, all possess the gift of dis-
tinctly longer than average arms.
These five or six players have
arrived at the shed from disparate
parts of the world: a French engi-
neer with a penchant for gadgets, a
Pakistani immigrant and a Brazilian
billionaire to name but a few.
It is a little known fact that there
exists a number of analysis tech-
niques used in the professional
world of squash - the most famous
of these being the SS Index (devel-
oped at the Gary Tanaka Building).
This ratio pits a competitor’s style
against their success and the shed
has produces a wide spread of SS
indices in its team.
At one end of the spectrum lies
our French international, Monsieur
Elliot. His seemingly uncoordinated
movements in conjunction with his
equally uncoordinated facial hair
make for an unparallel strategy of
distraction. While his style rating
strays dangerously close to zero his
success rate flies high, charged by
an obscene will to win.
Mr. Kadan (an Indian potato farm-
er) lies nearer the other end of the
SS spectrum. His classically trained
style drastically fails to compensate
his inability to run. His uncanny ten-
dency to forget he is playing squash
while on court has all but eradicated
any signs of success.
In the middle lies our Pakistani
immigrant Mr Kardar. In him lies
maybe the only balanced player of
the team. If he can overcome his
porcine physique he might be able
to curb his propensity to run into
walls (momentum = mass*velocity).
However he remains the shed’s
best chance to produce a truly great
player?
A thought for the formulating
guru’s at Tanaka. The well tested
theory of the SS Index has no expla-
nation for our Brazilian millionaire,
Mr. Brantley. He lacks both style
and success. Is zero an accepta-
ble measure of his squash ability?
Maybe we’ll know at the end of the
season, after all a team is only as
strong as its weakest link.

After last week’s shock non-thrilling
1-0 victory over Arts, IC 7’s took their
100% record to Chislehurst looking
to prove to their coach/fan Duncan
that they still knew how to play the
beautiful game the way it was meant
to be played. Beautifully.
Fortunately for the 7’s, IC 6’s had
played against, and beaten, QM’s
4th’s the week before, and were more
than willing to pass on the secret
to their success: Queen Mary’s
just cannot resist being taken from
behind. Armed with this top secret
information, the 7’s set out with the
express intention of gifting Queen
Mary’s an early lead. This proved
easier said than done, however, as
their hilarious “attackers” missed
a string of chances, each one easier
than the last, before finally taking
advantage of a well-staged and thor-
oughly convincing “defensive error”
to roll the ball past a stranded Ian,
IC’s emergency stand-in goalkeeper
(picked for his expertise as a wick-
etkeeper…well, it kind of makes
sense, doesn’t it?).
A 1-0 deficit successfully estab-
lished, IC’s Bat-signal was sent up
into the south London sky and the
7’s sprang into action. Wave after
wave of magnificent attacking foot-
ball crashed against the bows of
Queen Mary’s pirate ship as their
defenders cowered in the face of
a terrifying storm of IC pressure.
Something had to give. And it did.
Debutant Jas was proving a thorn
in the side for QM and had already
come close on several occasions
before he lashed in a left footed
effort from close range to provide
the equaliser. More pressure fol-
lowed as Sam went close with a
superb effort from inside the cen-
tre-circle, and Sandy almost scored
after a great run in from the right
of the QM area. He went one bet-
ter soon after as he swooped on a
rebound from Jarlath’s shot to give
IC the lead.
The half ended with IC looking
comfortable and good value for their
lead. The two teams could not have
deployed more contrasting styles,
with IC zipping and pinging the ball
about with verve and pizzazz while
QM’s game plan centred on creating
chances from their own goal kicks.
Hoof hoof hoof!! Sam’s inspirational
half-time team-talk was obviously a
load of shite, however, as IC some-
how found themselves clinging on in

the early stages of the second half.
In another demoralising victory
for terrible football, the big-kickers
were firmly on top and although
Mo and Paul at centre back did a
fine job gobbling up the big balls,
IC’s football became increasingly
frantic as QM created a string of
half, perhaps even three quarter
chances. After 2,368 minutes of the
second half had gone by without a
goal (I think they were cheating….
must be medics) IC swept upfield to
put the result beyond doubt as Sam
picked out Jarlath on the edge of the
box, and Jarlath’s trademark finish
finally brought the curtains down
on the longest game of football that
ULU division 4 has ever seen. Four
wins from four and IC Seventh’s are
top of the league. Hooray!!!
