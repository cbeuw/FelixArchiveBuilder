I
t seemed like only yesterday
that David Blunkett (below)
was involved in a sleaze scan-
dal. Oh, hang on, it was yes-
terday. As Felix was going to
presslastweek,therecentlyappoint-
ed work and pensions secretary
resigned for the second time within
a year as he faced scrutiny over tak-
ing up work with DNA Bioscience
without seeking advice from the
Independent Advisory Committee
on Business Appointments, which
breached the ministerial code. He
was also criticised for buying shares
in this company. On resigning, he
admitted he made a mistake and
apologised ‘for the embarrassment
I have caused [Tony Blair]’. He will
now return to the backbenches to
serve as a local MP
.
In a following parlimentary ses-
sion, Conservative leader Michael
Howard used this to launch a scath-
ing attack on Mr. Blair, labelling him
as a ‘lame duck’, and described Mr.
Blair as being “In office but not in
power”
Things got from bad to worse for
Labour when Charles Clarke (below)
was forced to make a tactical retreat
over his anti-terror laws, as a fear of
defeat led him to delay inserting a
clause to hold potential terror sus-
pects for 90 days, telling Radio 4’s
Today programme that ‘he wanted
to reach a consensus’. A seperate
vote on whether to include the glo-
ryfying of terrorism as a crime in
the bill was only passed by one vote,
with absent rebel MP’s seen as the
reason it passed in the first place. A
long week for Labour indeed.
Rocking the vote
A week is a
long time

A brief overview of the political societies active in College
S
WSS believes another
world is both possible and
necessary, a world run
by ordinary people in the
interests of ordinary peo-
ple. It is evident that poverty, war
and oppression are all symptomatic
of the social and economic struc-
tures present today and they cannot
be resolved without fundamental
changes. Further it is only the activ-
ity of the people that can transform
the world to create a truly socialist
society.
Here at Imperial the SWSS group
organises many debates, discus-
sions, film showings and cultural
events revolving around how the
people of the world can unite to
move society forward.
However the most important role
SWSS plays is in the active ongo-
ing campaigns both on campus and
throughout London. SWSS has been
central in the fight for student wel-
fare here at Imperial, campaigning
over issues such as top-up fees, hall
rent increases and student repre-
sentation. SWSS has led the anti-war
movement in college. Side by side
with Islamic Soc, Imperial against
Imperialism and Amnesty, SWSS
has initiated the Free Babar Ahmed
Campaign, fighting for the civil lib-
erties of a former student impris-
oned without trial. Outside of college
members of SWSS have supported
various workers and aided the suc-
cessful Respect election campaign
“We are the most
active of the main
parties at Imperial;
ConSoc is a great way
to meet
fellow minded
students.”

Respect Society
R
espect was born out of
the anti war movement.
The urge to find an alter-
native to a government
that took the country to
war even when the majority of the
population was against it has pro-
vided an MP (George Galloway) and
a Councillor (Ollie Rahman).
Respect stands for:
An end to the war and occupation
in Iraq.
An end to all privatisation and
the bringing back into democratic
public ownership of the railways and
other public services.
An education system that is not
based on the ability to pay, compre-
hensive and gives an equal chance
in life to every child from nursery to
university.
The repeal of the Tory anti-union
laws.
Opposition to all forms of discrimi-
nation based on race, gender, eth-
nicity, religious beliefs (or lack of
them), sexual orientation, disability,
national origin or citizenship
An end to the destruction of the
environment by states and corpora-
tions for whom profit is more impor-
tant than sustaining the natural
world on which all life depends.
Student Respect on campus aims
to include a broad range of people
from a range of different societies
and backgrounds. This will enable
Respect as a group to campaign on
a number of different issues such as
a permanent Friday prayer venue
for Muslim students, improving
the colleges environmental policy,
removing the weapons research
that occurs within the college and
looking out for the civil liberties of
all students of imperial college.
Within a few weeks time student
Respect at imperial will be sup-
porting a civil liberties campaign
that will incorporate a “Know Your
Rights” theme, where students can
find out what to do and what their
rights are if held under the sec-
tion 44 anti-terror laws. If anyone
is interested in helping to organise
or publicise the meeting they are
more than welcome and can email
Respectatimperial@yahoo.co.uk or
visit respectcoalition.org for general
information.

Labour Society
I
mperial College Labour
Society is the society for stu-
dents and staff at Imperial
College who believe in the
Labour values of equality,
democracy and social justice. We
are an open society aiming to pro-
vide a forum to discuss and debate
Labour ideas and policy.
This Thursday (10th November)
the always entertaining Steve Pound
MP will be joining us for a drink
in the Union bar at 7pm to chat
about what Parliament is really like.
Before becoming an MP
, Steve has
had a varied career including work-
ing as a seaman, bus conductor and
hospital porter.
As a member of Imperial College
Labour Society you can expect an
exciting mix of guest speakers,
MPs and ministers, giving you a
chance to question the Government.
We organise lively debates, social
events and campaigning. The socie-
ty has been addressed by Education
Minister Stephen Twigg, and former
Secretary of State for Health,
Frank Dobson MP
, joined us for a
lively discussion about the NHS.
More recently Hilary Benn MP
,
Secretary of State for International
Development, highlighted Labour’s
achievements in increasing foreign
aid spending and cancelling the debt
of the world’s poorest countries.
Former Cabinet Minister Michael
Meacher MP spoke passionately
about his opposition to the war in
Iraq.
Later this term we will be run-
ning an event highlighting the huge
human rights abuses taking place in
Colombia in association with Justice
for Colombia. Also invited for this
term is Science Minister Lord
Sainsbury to talk about the state of
British Science.
We are affiliated to Labour
Students and the society has good
links with London Young Labour,
which provides further opportuni-
ties for meeting like minded people
across London.
Whether you’re a Labour Party
member or are just interested in
politics and want a say, you’ll be
welcome.

T
he IC Conservative
Society welcomes mem-
bers from all quarters.
Obviously,westandinsup-
port of the Conservative
Party and its policies, but we are
open as a forum of debate for con-
servative ideas. All are welcome,
with a low membership fee of £3, or
£5 including Conservative Future
membership (the youth wing of the
national party). We are by far the
most active of the main three British
political parties at Imperial; ConSoc
is a great way to meet fellow-minded
students.
Our main meeting is every
Tuesday at 12.00 in the Union bar,
where we have a fun informal chat.
We also have guest speakers and go
to local and national party events.
For example, we are attending a
talk by David Cameron on his vision
for the party at Knightsbridge this
evening: a first-class event that only
costs £10 to ConSoc members. Such
events generally include a plentiful
supply of wine, and we go out to
the pub afterwards and shoot the
breeze. ConSoc is worth joining for
the social events alone! We also take
part in election campaigning for
the party, for instance in this May’s
General Election, which is a great
way to meet people and directly
stand up for Conservative beliefs.
You don’t need to be a hack to join
ConSoc; our meetings are relaxed
and good-humoured. Find your nat-
ural political home with us!
