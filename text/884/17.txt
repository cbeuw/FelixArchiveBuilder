actually invented concentration camps—
the current people of Japan are deeply
ashamed, sorry and embarrassed about
their war history. They are no more
responsible for the atrocities of their
imperialistic w a r of expansion than are
the current German people for the events
from 1939 to 1945.
Mr Bailey, w h o like all people of a
similar twisted mind (it is reported that he
has sported a 'Hang Nelson Mandela' T-
shirt) obviously doesn't k n o w his facts.
During the Pacific War in Japan the
policy of the w a r was dictated by a
handful of fanatical militarists (names
supplied o n request, not that M r Bailey
would recognise them) w h o revered the
Emperor as a god (a little like M r Bailey
and the war vets) and firmly believed the
mythical descension of Japan and the
Emperor from the sun god Amatarsu,
thus justifying the expansive policies of
the post-Meiji restoration period.
The population was deceived in a big
way. This is not a uniquely Japanese
phenomenon, h o w else can y o u explain
three consecutive Tory governments. T h e
effects of the w a r on the Japanese people
were horrendous. It is salient to
remember that at the time most of Japan
was starving and there was a lot of
opposition to the endless w a r perpetuated
by the militarists and the Zaibetsu (large
conglomerate companies w h o were
making a fortune out of the war). A d d to
this the approximately 200,000 victims of
the twin hells of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
and the balance looks different.
The Pacific w a r was driven by a few

men and their fanatic minions (of the
German Third Reich) as are most. T h e
Americans, w h o occupied a n d rebuilt
Japan (destroying a lot of traditional
culture that far surpasses m u c h of the
West), were received gratefully as they
removed the leaders w h o h a d caused the
war. Hirohito's part in this has never
been proven a n d is indeed unlikely as he
was k n o w n to hold Marine Biology above
most things, and was probably not able to
exercise real power as he was a purely
figurative monarch after the Meiji
Restoration of the 19th Century and thus
held little or n o actual power.
The refusal to let these things lie down
(they should never be forgotten but can
be forgiven) is unbelievably
counterproductive for closer world
cooperation—this obviously would not
bother M r Bailey as he does not live in
the real world anyway. T h e Japanese are
no longer our enemies—they are just
more successful in rebuilding their
economy (13th place in the per capita
incomes in 1971, 1st or 2 n d now; top ten
largest world banks are Japanese; Japan
is the biggest creditor nation with a huge
budget surplus) and have meticulous
attention to detail. They are possibly the
best educated nation in the world (94%
complete up to High School level), most
literate and have great stability in their
country. T h e y are very cultured and are
very sensitive. T o make modern Japan
responsible for its past crimes would be
like indicting Queen Elizabeth for the
Victorian Empire—ridiculous.
I have a great respect and love for the

PERSONAL
• BIG DICK pops out, 'Must go now, things are
beginning to stretch'.
Japanese people, culture, history and
language and to see an ill-informed, badly
written and openly racist letter from an
obviously ignorant bigot like M r Bailey
makes me both angry and sad. Please, if
possible, publish m y letter in full as I feel
he could do with the education.
If he wants any private tuition in
Japanese history, I will make sure it will
be a memorable experience. With
reference to the coronation of Emperor
Akihito, I can only say that I wish I had
been there. In future M r Bailey should
learn the truth before be opens his big
mouth and in this w a y he will ensure that
the only vicious attacks that come his
way are ones in the form of a letter.
Yours,
Matthew Salter, Chem PG 1.
