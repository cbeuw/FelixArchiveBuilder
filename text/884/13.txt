ULU Upper
Reserves
IC II—5 L S E - 4
This first round match of the U L U cup
was played in true Cup tradition as the
agony and ecstacy piled higher with each
minute as the game's fortunes
rollercoastered. IC found themselves
having to defeat the elements as much as
LSE. T h e Harlington howler made it
difficult for IC to play their composed
passing game. Despite this IC swept into
the lead as A Jalan finished off a great
move. Defensive errors and missed
chances saw the half-time score 2-1 to
LSE. With the wind behind them, IC
levelled from a M Plummer spectacular,
minutes into the second half. IC were
now camped in LSE's half w h o still
managed to take the lead again.
Opportunist goals from S Barry and A
Jalan gave IC a deserved 4-3 lead. IC n o w
dominated until the end w h e n L S E defied
the odds and gods to force extra time.
IC's extra class, fitness and determination
told in extra time. Simon Barry and his
wooden leg dealt the killer blow just
minutes before the need for penalties.
LSE were left crying and IC were left
believing 'Our name is on the Cup!'.

IC V I - 5 MUCH II-1
IC 6ths had to wait for over an hour in
cold and windy conditions for Middlesex
and University College Hospital to
summon up the courage to face them. IC
had their biggest crowd of the season,
injured Dave Buckle escorted by two
female admirers, and they were
determined not to disappoint them. The
6ths took c o m m a n d of the game
immediately but it was 20 minutes before
Ruban Ramachandran opened the scoring
with, unheard of in the 6ths, a header!
This was the sign for IC to do their usual
demolition job, goals from Dave Phillips,
A n d y Briscoe a n d A k i o Iwase made it 4-0
at half-time.
The second half saw Keith Cordeiro
consolidate the lead. However, without
the incredible skill and determination of
their brilliant captain (substituted) IC
allowed Middlesex a consolation goal a
few mintues from time. This w i n puts the
6ths into the quarter finals of the U L U
cup and increases their goal scoring
record to 31 in only 5 games.
Women's
Basketball
O n Saturday November 17 the U A U
tournament was held in Essex University.
W e started off the day with seven players
and one of w h i c h was injured. So one of
our main players was out. T h e first game,
against Sussex, was easy. It was nice
going and w e beat them b y 11 points.
Right after this 40 minute game w e had
another one against Kent. Unfortunately
we were so tired that w e just couldn't
keep up with them. W e lost another
player half-way through this game. So
now w e had to be careful as w e only had
five players left.
Our third a n d last game was the
hardest and w e had to w i n it to go to the
semi-finals. During the whole game w e
were all nervous and uptight. Only five
players so w e couldn't lose any more. W e
scored one basket, they scored another
and it was close all the way. A t the last
ten seconds we were up by three points
but unfortunately they were able to score
a lucky three pointer. Time ended and
we were tired. W e had five minutes
extended time and managed to beat them
by one basket. The day was long and
tiring but we had the result that will take
us to the semi-finals.

IC Mens lsts—8 Surrey Mens lsts—1
IC Mens 2nds—9 Surrey Mens 2nds—0
IC Ladies—4 Surrey Ladies—5
W i t h L S E unable to produce a team this
week, IC palyed their last match to
complete the round-robin. Of the three
teams entered i n the U A U championships
IC Mens lsts a n d 2nds managed to merge
group winners. Unluckily for the ladies
they failed b y one game. 1st pair W e n d y
Tan and U t a Boltze gained two valuable
points. 2nd pair Emily F o k and Fiona
Gattely and 3rd pair Tracey Norman and
Claire Roberts beat the weaker Surrey
3rd pair for another two points. A t four
games each our 3rd pair put up a good
fight against Surrey 2nds before
conceeding a three-setter 11-15 in the
rubber set.
IC ladies n o w face the play-offs before
being able to proceed into the next
round. Good luck to all three teams in
having a favourable draw.
Hockey
ICHC 3rd X I - 1 Kodak II-1
Saturday saw the return of the 3rds
annual brawl with Kodak. Much to our
surprise, the game was played in a good
natured manner, with no sending offs.
The game started well for IC, with the
forwards ducking and diving with victory
their only aim. Only luck saved Kodak
for conceeding numerous goals, but a
lucky Kodak breakaway saw them score
with about 20 minutes gone.
The second half was m u c h the same
and we were rewarded b y V i c Parfitt
putting away a text-book short corner,
perfectly stopped by Matt Wong. Also
amusing was Marcus Hawkey's attempt to
neuter himself, and Murray Holdsworth
smashed a player's son in the knee
shortly after he came on at the end of
the game. Even more amazing was the
fact that w e played with only ten men,
and another player would have led to a
massive IC score.
Ladies'
Football
It all seems to be going horribly wrong
for the Dribblers this season. They just
can't take their beer anymore and
they've even started to w i n a few
matches. O l d Tricia Bradley is turning in
her grave. It a l l started with losing b y
only one goal to Kings w i t h a 4-3 result,
but then things got completely out of
hand when the young Dribblers beat
London Hospital 5-0. A n unrelenting
series of brutal tackles by an ex-hockey
player against the opposition's viking and
the Pele like skills of Mrs Lineker (Permy)
soon had the Dribblers on a path to
victory. Next to experience these new
found skills was the University of East
Anglia. These yokels from the East were
gobstruck b y the awesome talents of the
Dribblers which included a tremendous
verbal performance between Mrs
Gascoigne (alias Nina) and a member of
the opposition with suspect tendencies.
Mrs Lineker scored her accustomary
three goals and w e jugged accordingly.
Next it was off to play U C L with one
player short a n d no Willie John in sight!!
Well this was a game of two halfs and
the girls done well with the defence
benefitting from the wisdom of the late
great Lucy, a star of yesteryear, also
famous for her talent in obtaining minibus
keys. The girls got a result anyway of 1-1
but unfortunately were again not on form
for the boatrace and the manager is n o w
considering sending the team to a drink
farm for a weekend to remedy the
situation.
