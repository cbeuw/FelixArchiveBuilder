Rag Roundup
T w o collectors, Martin Heighway and
Peter Bowen, have rased SI000 each for
rag since the beginning of term.
A southside resident, Dominic Jenkin,
has collected £ 6 6 so far from people
signing the plaster cast o n his broken
arm. H e does not hope to make it an
annual event
Last Friday's Hypnosis Lecture,
although not as popular as last year,
attracted a close to capacity audience. It
has proved to be one of the best fund
raising events, with people returning
every year. It made over £ 1 0 0 0 .
Tuesday's slave auction rased nearly
£700. T h e highest bids were all £50.
Claire Godfery was bought b y
M.Michailidia, o n his own, Louise Rafferty
& Suzanne A h m e t by the Guilds Rugby
Club and Murray Williamson b y City &
Guilds Union. They were closely followed
by Kate Dalton, bought by her admirer
Karl Edwin for £ 4 5 and Sarah Rusholm
for £41 - see front cover.
S C A B Night made only a small profit,
Comedy Night and the Barn Dance losing
money. Bar staff at the Barn Dance said
that 'the turnout sucked, as did the
organisation.' W h e n questioned further
the staff told Felix that the J C R had been
deserted w h e n they arrived at 7.30 and
that no chairs or tables had been moved.
One of the staff commented that 'We
thought it'd been cancelled!'.
The incredibly hard Bar Quiz o n
Wednesday was w o n b y the Phallix
Players F . U . , a team from the Felix
Office. It raised £ 1 3 0 and was enjoyed by
all involved (especially those who gained
Jive-Bunny T-shirts and posters). It can be
truly described as a record breaking
event as not one Jive-Bunny 45 remained
intact by the end of the evening.
Exec Initiative, the process of losing
C C U Presidents and the I C U exec
somewhere in England a n d expecting
them to return to IC by their wits, had an
unexpected twist this year. Murray
Williamson, ICU H o n Sec, together with
Cathy McClay, Guilds President,
persuaded the Rag team to stop for a
group photograph. Although chained
together at the feet, they outwitted the
team by driving off in their transport.
The main forthcoming Rag events are
the Guilds Carnival tonight (£4.50 in the
Union) and the Mines Dirty Disco o n
Monday (£2.50 in the JCR, F R E E naked!).
