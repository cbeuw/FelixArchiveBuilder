Manager's Bit
Space
The final frontier maybe, but where the
hell does it all go to. The issue this week
is far, far too small to include half the
stuff 1 wanted and needed to include. It
didn't help w h e n more and more
advertising flowed out of the office
corners, pushing like a merciless cuckoo.
A n d so, it gives me great pleasure to
apologise to FBI Soc and others for not
including an A d for them this week
(Contact FBI soon about their C V Comp.).
N.B. The B i g Fun Christmas one will be
hitting the streets on the Wednesday
before the end of term. (Hint - Get your
arse in gear N O W if you want to
contribute anything towards this one)
R A G
W e l l it's been a stunning R A G W e e k
hasn't it. It is rather a shame because,
apart from the obvious point of m a k i n g
some money for a good cause, a lot of
you have missed out on a potentially
goooood! time. The mainstays have saved
the day at least with a reasonable
turnover at the Beer Festival, Hypnosis,
and the C + G Slave Auction. It only
remains to be seen if the Guilds Carnival
and the Dirty Disco do well, together
with some fun at the other events. The
confrontation between Cardiff and IC Rag
has still I am sure plenty of mileage left
on the road to sort out their differences.
This week we include a brief news article
on the problem as first mentioned in the
Manager's Bit last week. Next week we
will be following up the issue with a
more detailed look at the letters we have
received from both of the Rags
concerned.
Letters
Scribblers' Corner seems to taking off
better and better each week. Its
popularity has produced so many letters
this week that we have enough material
already for next weeks section.
Finally a Goodbye
It was announced today that after around
three years Reggie Blennerhasset, the ICU
Finance Officer, is leaving us to go on to
other things. It has always been a
pleasure w o r k i n g with him and it marks a
sad loss to the Union. I trust that his new
appointment though will allow him to use
his talents to their full extent. He has
worked hard alongside many others
during his time here and it will be
interesting to see who the boys upstairs

will find to replace him. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ™ ~
