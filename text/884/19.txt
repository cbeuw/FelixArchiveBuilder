Southside Bar
A few complaints have been raised by
both local residents and College personnel
ragarding noise levels at closing time.
Licensing authorities tend to view all
College bars, including Union, Holland
Club and Hall bars, under the same
umbrella. This means that if one loses its
license—or more likely, the frequency of
its bar extensions—then all other bars
may suffer the same fate.
Please try to keep the peace at kicking
out time.
College Day
Hon Sec
Rag
For reasons unbeknown to most, it has
been a very quiet Rag W e e k . Thanks to
everyone that has turned up, your
donations will be going to needy causes.
Thanks also to all the people who have
made the events run so smoothly.
Discussion will follow the week and
changes made for next year.
Do turn up for the remaining events
namely the Guilds Carnival tonight, the
Bar Games tomorrow evening, Tug-o-War
on Sunday and the ever-popular Mines'
Dirty Disco on Monday night.
Events
Some of you may have been miffed or
will be a little displeased about not being
allowed to use the bar after normal hours
without paying to enter the gig...tough.
The 'Special Order of Exemption' has
been granted for a reason and not for
groups of mates to go out on a bender
until 2am in the morning. F r o m now on
the Union Bar will close at 11pm after
which time the Snack Bar side bar will
remain open until closure.
In the past we have got annoyed with
people gaining entry to a gig without
paying by w a y of having a smudge on
the back of their hand. To overcome this
we have invested in a complete Ultra
Violet ('Black Light') entry system, which
is almost infallable if it all works to plan.
The kit is available for hire using your
own stamp. The first real test of these
new measures will be at tonight's
Carnival, so be warned.
On Wednesday nights as part of the
Libido Ents disco (which is free), the bar
will be open until midnight but as part of
the evening there will be cheap beer
promotions, eg Castlemaine X X X X for
50p a»pint.
We have also planned events for the
bar. There is another Bar Quiz on
December 6 and on Tuesday 11 there will
be entertainment supplied by a singer
much in the vein of a pub entertainer.
Many people have complained about
publicity being taken down, bans placed,
The second meeting of the W o r k i n g Party
has met. The current proposal on the
table is:
M O N D A Y A N D F R I D A Y
Start: 9am
Lunch: 12 n o o n - l p m or l p m - 2 p m
(varying across the College)
Finish: 6pm
T U E S D A Y A N D T H U R S D A Y
Start: 9am
Lunch: 12 n o o n - l p m or l p m - 2 p m
(varying across the College)
Finish: 6pm
etc. Most of these were petty, ill-informed
complaints and they were not worth
replying to. Clubs and societies should
have received a list of publicity rules
from me via their MSC. If you choose to
ignore them, no matter w h o you are, you
will get stuffed.
College are trying to tidy the place up a
little, it's a bit like the Forth Bridge, but I
agree with their cause. Bits of blu-tac all
over the w a l k w a y is pretty unsightly and
Estates have v e r y kindly arranged for
about 20 white notice boards to be put
up along the w a l k w a y . These and not the
walkway b r i c k w o r k must be used. Posters
affixed to the brickwork will be removed
and the perpetrators charged the cost of
cleaning up. This will also happen for the
Beit Quad walls.
The money charged for publicity fines
will be going to Help a London Child
which was decided by Sarah Harland, ICU
Publicity Officer, and myself.
Rooms
If people want to book a large room this
side of Christmas....tough. The diary is
completely full so don't even bother to
come and ask me.
Clubs and societies requiring regular
rooms for next term are urged to put in
an application for now as the 1991 diary
is filling up. Y o u won't be guaranteed to
get a room but at least you will have a
chance.
Elections
We will have to wait until 5.30pm today
to see if we have an election for FELIX
Editor. If we do the election will be cross-
campus plus the other sites on December
3 and 4. The Hustings will be on
Wednesday November 28 in the Union
Lounge.
Full details of the Single Transferable
Vote system of voting and other details
will be in next week's F E L I X .
At the same time as the F E L I X Editor a
ballot will be held as to your views about
the College day changes, see Paul's bit.
See you tonight.
Murray Williamson.
W E D N E S D A Y
Start: 9am
Finish: 12 noon
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, teaching in
the afternoon may resume at either 2pm
or 3pm. B y resuming at 2pm an extra
two hours would be added onto the
College week, but some students may
miss the humanities programme.
Resuming at 3pm gives less flexibility but
ensures that those who wish to
participate in humanities can do so.
The advantages of starting on the hour
are to provide consistency with other
London colleges, and to hook up with
'Livenet' w h i c h starts programming on
the hour.
In order to get a sizable response from
everyone, there will be a referendum on
this issue. Designed to tie in with
elections for F E L I X Editor, it will be held
on the 3rd and 4th December. Ballot
boxes will appear in each department
(except St Mary's—who aren't affected).
Just show your Union card and vote
either for or against the proposals.
The feedback from the referendum will
go to the next meeting of the W o r k i n g
Party on December 6th.

International
Aids Day
December 1 will be International Aids
day. The aim of the day is to promote
awareness and provide information on
Aids. The campaign will focus on
heterosexual transmission as this accounts
for the majority of cases worldwide.
The Union will be participating by
circulating information and generally
promoting the day on Friday November
30.
A n y volunteers who wish to get
involved please contact myself or Paul
Shanley.

Officer.
