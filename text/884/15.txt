Dear Chris,
How long are we to endure this
bigoted, xenophobic sycophant, (look
them up Alan). If I felt any need for such
naive drivel I understand Gary Bushell
wastes paper in a similar manner for that
tabloid rag the Sun. That anyone can still
hold such views is both sad and
deplorable—a result of ignorance and
intollerance.
Remembrance day is not simply about
'Our Boys' who made the supreme
sacrifice for 'Queen and Country'. The
'glory' Alan revels in is a result of how
we have fashioned history so as to
appear in better light, coupled with a
virtual hijacking of the ceremony by the
Royal British Legion.
We seem to have chosen to recall only

Dear Sir,
I would like to point out a small but
important mistake on page 5 of last
week's FELIX. The advert for the
'International Night' should have been
'International Ball'.
It is important to note the mistake
because the 'International Night' is also
organised by the Overseas Students
Committee and is held at the end of
February or the beginning of March. The
'International Night' is very popular and is
widely believed to be one of the best
events organised at Imperial College.

the conflicts we 'won'; the two World
Wars; the Falklands confict, no mention is
made of the Boer War, the last Britain
'lost', or the continuing conflict in
Northern Ireland.
Alan condemns the horrific attrocities
committed in the Japanese concentration
camps but conveniently makes no
mention that this 'noble country' tried to
systematically elminate the Afrikaner
people in similar death camps, whilst
treating the Black population worse than
animals—still feel patriotic, Alan?
Clearly Alan has never visited the
Vietnam war memorial in Washington,
there one will find no 'glory', only the
pain and recognition of the true cost of
war. America lost that war, and in doing
so lost much of her spirit. It took ten
The 'International Ball' is another event
organised to bring together people from
different backgrounds. It is being held on
December 4, from 9.30pm till 3am at

misprint.

years to come to terms with these
attrocities but at least Americans
remember.
Contrary to what Alan would have us
believe, it was not just the 'boys who did
not make it back' who made sacrifices.
Millions in this country and throughout
the world endured real suffering. Does he
really believe that the two million
Japanese who died from the blasts, fall-
out and radiation sickness all wanted to
rule the world? Does every beer swilling,
Audi driving 'Kraut' really want to rule
Europe? 'Up yours Delors'? Wake up Alan
this is 1990 not 1940.
Remembrance day is a means of forcing
us to recall the horrors of all warfare,
Dresden, Vietnam, Northern Ireland, the
things of which we are least proud. It is
not a time to glorify human suffering.
During this time of conflict it should be
especially so. Will Alan only realise this
when 'Our Boys' are being flown home
from the Gulf in black plastic bags draped
in Union Jacks?
For me Remembrance day is about
many things and many images; The war
widow at the front of the Church; the
thousands who starved to death in
occupied Holland; the mounds of dead
bodies outside Auschwitz; the newly
widowed mother in Northern Ireland, left
to explain why to her child; the screams
of children bathed in napalm; the terrified
young conscripts—and, oh yes, the
soldiers who did not make it back.
