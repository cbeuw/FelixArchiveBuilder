Dear FELIX,
In response to Alan Bailey's letter of
issue 883 of F E L I X . I, like Prince Charles,
was not at the Cenotaph last
commemoration day. Personally, 1 could
never partake i n such a n event which
makes men w h o fought in the Wars
heroes and, in so doing, it glorifies the
cause for w h i c h they died. These men
went away to kill fellow humans with
guns, just as a lame horse might be put
down. But instead of the motive being
sympathy, it was hatred and fear.
Of all those people who lived and died
in the Wars, w e should remember those
who would not fight, all those 'cowards',
afraid to die, and equally afraid to kill. T o
me the real cowards were those who
sought for a solution in massacre and
mayhem, all the while claiming that this
was what they fought to prevent.
It is c o m m o n belief that the hardships
and sufferings caused by the Wars is
justified when the attrocities of defeat are
considered. N o w w e face the same
dilemma in the Gulf. A n d every time
through the ages when people have faced
such problems 'fellow patriotic
countrymen' have gathered to fight and
protect their country, and their society. Is
this not proof enough that there is
something fundamentally wrong with our
society, or are patriotic causes the only
times when murder may be permitted?
We allot ouselves territories, speak our
own language, make our o w n laws, and
will readily dismiss another person for no
better reason than that he lives within a

Hatred is passed down from generation
to generation, so that w e can be fighting
our Grandfather's war with the
Grandchildren of his enemy. Similarly w e
can ignore all the hardships existing
outside our country, by making the
governments of those people responsible.
1 will not respect those w h o died while
they were prepared to kill, neither can I
reconcile the view that by remembering
the sadness of war, w e prevent it in the
future.
Yours sincerely,
Dominic Jenkin.

Dear Chris,
1 had to do some research before
writing this letter in response to A l a n
Bailey's of Issue 883—just in order to
check that his letter was not a joke in the
poorest of tastes. Unfortunately, having
been informed that this particular
individual was well k n o w n for his poorly
informed, bigoted, ill-reasoned and
xenophobic views and was therefore
quite capable of writing this kind of
ignorant trash, I took up pen to write.
The pen, they say, is sharper than the
Samurai sword.
While I respect and a m grateful for the
sacrifices made by men and women to
defend Britain in two world wars and
thus believe in the validity of a day of
remembrance for them I cannot elevate
them to demi-god status as does M r
Bailey. W a r is not glorious, the people
who died in the wars while being brave
and selfless were not heroes at all—just
people unfortunate enough to have been
called upon to fight—I'm sure none of
them would have preferred fighting to
other activities. A t the Cenotaph, many
highly respected people were present
giving ample representation. People who
revere the sacrifices of war a n d
constantly drag up the suffering and pain
of these dreadful incidents are people,
probably m u c h like Mr Bailey—who was
not old enough to remember any of the
horrors of war (neither a m I) and if called
to fight would probably shit himself. Let
us not forget the salient facts that no
one's war record is clean—the British
continued overleaf
week.
