Guns are the central theme of this
film; guns and shooting people.
Jamie Lee Curtis stars as Megan
Turner, a recently graduated New Y o r k
cop. ' W h y would a beautiful w o m a n like
you want to become a cop?' people ask,
'Because 1 want to shoot people', she
replies. A n d indeed she does; on her first
night on the beat she shoots and kills an
armed robber w h o is holding up a
supermarket.
Unfortunately the rubber's gun can't be
found afterwards and witnesses could not
cororborate her story, so she ends up
suspended for shooting an apparently
unarmed suspect. So where did the gun
go? Well, it was removed from the scene
by Eugene Hunt (Ron Silver) a wealthy
commodity broker, who was doing his
shopping w h e n it all happened. So
impressed was he by Turner's shooting
down of the robber that he was inspired
to become a psycopathic killer and
swiped the gun for this purpose. He then
scratches Megan's name on the cartridges
and goes out and shoots someone point
blank. The police and Megan are
somewhat perturbed to find her name on
the cartridge and the case is taken on by
homicide detective Nick M a n n (Clancy
Brown) who reluctantly takes Turner on
as his deputy. A t the same time Eugene
contrives a chance meeting with Megan
and an affair begins. A n d so on and so
forth.
This film, directed by Kathryn Bigelow,
is a serious attempt at a 'realistic' thriller
with a fair bit of character development
and all the violence shown is graphic and
often gory. It certainly looks good but the
plot lets it down. The idea that an
apparently clean-living, stockbroker could
sink into madness so quickly and avoid
the law and bullets so effectively (apart
Guards! Guards!

Following the cries of pain and
anguish that followed m y last
review of one of his books where 1
slandered the great and holy Pratchett, I
will start by saying that this book is
completely, utterly and unequivocally
reasonable.
His trend of taking old stories and
changing the characters, adding a little
wit and sarcasm, and flogging the result
to his undying devoted fans continues. He
has copied parts of The Hobbit and
numerable other fairy stories, and even
imitated somebody else's sense of humour
to come up with his latest masterpiece.
Written in a very Monty Python style
sense of humour it is a easy book to get
along with, the characters are amazingly
stupid and he produces what in some
places is a very funny book. Unusually
for one of his books he's managed to get
a plot into the story, and even a little
suspense (whatever next, a 'real' book?)
which all makes for a very pleasant read.
For me the best part is w h e n the city
guard are trying to kill a dragon by
hitting it in the 'vulnerables.' (doesn't that
remind you of another book?) It's decided
that 'its a million-to-one chance, but it
might just work' so when somebody
suggests that the odds might be slightly
better (the archer is using his lucky
arrow) they do every thing they can to
make the odds exactly a million-to-one.
This includes making him wear a stupid
hat, blindfolding him and even making
him stand one-legged in a bowl of
custard.
Definitely an improvement over
'Pyramids', although he could do a lot
better. He's even made allowances for
first time readers by explaining many of
the quirks and foibles of the world the
story is based in.
His fans will buy it and love it, others
should buy it and read it.

from the fact that Ron Silver looks like a
psychopathic killer) is slightly
implausable.
By the end Blue Steel becomes m u c h
the same as any other A m e r i c a n cop
drama. Jamie Lee Curtis, however, plays
her role with great skill in a film totally
different from her last, A Fish Called
Wanda, showing her versatility as an
actress and for those who are interested,
no, she doesn't take her clothes off.

Dan Piraro introduces his two
collections of Far Sideesque
cartoons with a few well chosen
questions w h i c h give a fair idea of the
humour therein : since o x y g e n is
invisible, can we ever be truly certain it
is not making fun of us? Was Satan's
choice to appear to Eve as a serpent
instead of the more logical choice of a
poodle providential? A n d so on. Piraro's
cartoons are snappy one-framers of the
kind designed for stupid people to call
'wacky' and 'zany'. They are in fact very
funny and very clever. Ideal for all those
of you who have never
