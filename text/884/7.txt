An Emotional Fish are a four piece Irish
band with a particularly silly (but fairly
memorable) name. A s any Jasper Carrot
fan will tell you—fish (or is it just
goldfish?) only have a m e m o r y capacity
of a few seconds—so how they can be
'emotional' is beyond me, but more
importantly beyond a fish. They also
have a bassist called Edna—who is in fact
male! A n d to top it all I can't work out
what this L P is called—I have a suspicion
that it is the original An Emotional Fish
by An Emotional Fish.
Well at this point 1 shall admit that I'm
not very impressed, and I haven't actually
got d o w n to listening to their music y e t -
so here goes:
The L P has ten tracks and sounds at
An Emotional Fish LP
times like The Style Council, Prefab
Sprout and U2 among others—quite a
selection really.
The songs are wordy and intriguing to
get you reaching for the lyric sheet, but
once read they are not profound or
interesting enough to stick in your mind.
There is, however, an exception—Grey
Matter w h i c h could easily have been
called Ode to Imperial College ('Grey
matter fade away...it's a navigation to
nowhere'). To finish I quite like the
melodies, but to be brutal the singer's
voice spoils them, and his vocal style gets
more irritating every time I listen to the
LP.

B l u e P e a r l Naked LP
Yes, this is the album that brought
pornography to the airwaves, naked
steaming bodies on Radio One. Naked In
The Rain is the lead track o n this medley
of dance beat and smoochy vocals.
The next track continues with more of
the first, and could almost e part of the
extended remix, which is fine if you
bought the single. In fact, this track was
probably the 'clean' version, in case the
first got banned by sqealing Sharons.
The album continues with more beat
and even manages some rap and a great
chorus, 'I never knew, That I would fall
in love with y o u , I never knew, I don't
know what to do, I never knew, I never
knew, I never knew.' Catchy. 'Chill out.'
Well, it's mainstream, isn't it.
The best? track is a deconstruction of
Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill. No,
she definitely can't do those fiddly vocal
bits. Even the backing hasn't been
You've heard The Cure's pathetic effort at
their o w n cover. N o w experience THIS.
Trash, thrash and gurgles mark this
indelible but delectable delight. It's almost
changed but is drowned under a swajnp
of Stock, A i t k e n and Waterman beat-box.
It will do brilliantly. It's inevitable.

a relief after the Mixed Up version. Cure
fans stand back and be slaughtered.
Screams, grunge, howls and noise merge
and wail into a new heavy shriek. About
all that remains intact is the bass line in
an avalanche of confusion and H M
distortion.
As for the other three tracks, they're
pretty boring as far as psycho-thrash
goes. A deranged mix of a voice refined
by weeks of smoking and sandpaper,
mashed with various shrieks and H M
guitar solos.
W o r t h getting for the cover - death to
Robert Smith.

Swervedriver
Feet First 20.11.90
After an eternity of indie bop and shite,
the clock struck twelve and all went quiet
in anticipation hoping that we would get
some decent music at last to justify the
quid entrance fee.
The stage suddenly exploded with
colour, the purple being particularly
impressive, and on came Swervedriver
launching into their first song. Pretty
heavy stuff.
A number of influences came across in
their music, namely Pixies, Mary Chain
and Dinosaur Jnr. The vocalist struck me
as sounding like a heavier version of
Elvis Costello which w o r k e d really well, it
was a pity that the words he sung could
not be heard over the growing of the
guitars and the feedback.
Despite problems with bad mixing and
an out of tune bass Swervedriver proved
excellent entertainment. So, if you get the
chance, see them, they're good.
