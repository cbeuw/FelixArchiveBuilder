PASSABLE MAY REVUE
Since this was the first venture of it's kind, we
have no true criterion "by which to assess i t .
Waa i t meant to be in the vein of the R.0.3. smok-
ing concert, or a carnival cabaret?
It had a far more tolerant and generous audience,
so that all the humour in i t was revealed, and not cast
before Bacchus' devotees. Perhaps this explained the
ominous lapses of mirth in some of the sketches.
One suspects that Miss Jean Rook was responsible
for sixty per cent, of the revue, (if one includes per-
suading other people to participate - ninety five per
cent.)
There seemed a minimum of support from I.C., and
yet we have equal talent available as anyone who has
seen the rehearsals for our skits would agree. Even
Mr. Evans' joke which corrupted the headlines of this
paper after "Cavemen Capers" was repeated in inferior
manner.
Nevertheless, I laughed a lot for once because I
heard all the joke3, and some were well worth hearing.
The lesson to be learned is that i f we encourage the
comedians, both sides gain by the audience participation.

1st year Guildsmen take heart!
Quoted below is an "Ode to the Examinator" writ,
ten in the back of his materials report book by one
now in his 3rd year:
ODE TO THE EXAMINATOR
Strength of Materials Lab. Book 52/3
I have taken steel and timber,
And treated i t with care.
To exceed the elastic limit
I only once did dare.
Oh, Dear Examinator,
Give ear to my entreaties,
Let m
e go ahead next year,
And smash the stuff to pieces.
Within a short time the reply was waiting for
him in the letter rack - "The Answer to a Student's
Prayer"
ANSWER TO A STUDENTS PRAYER.
Your fate, alas, depends not on your verse,
But on your work - whioh may of oourse be
worse,
And on your graphs and drawings many
Depends your ohanoe to stay - i f any.
Examinator.
Full marks, Mr. Examinator!
P.S. They did let him stay & without repeating!
PROF. READ'S FAREWELL
At the annual dinner of the De l a beche Club, the
society of the geologists, mining geologists, and
o i l men, a fond farewell was bidden to the Pro-
Hector, geology professor Head. The President of
the club, C l i f f James, presented Prof. Head with
an inscribed s i l v e r tankard.
Professor Head said, i n thanking the club, that
when he l e f t Liverpool University he was present-
ed with a"rather more humble" beer mug. he then
proposed "Read's Law" which postulates that every
r e t i r i n g professor of geology should be presented
with a beer mug.
Before the dinner Professor Head gave a lecture
on "Geologistology, 1908 - 1955." - a survey of
geologists that he had met i n that time, he ment-
ioned also that he was often mistaken for S i r
Hubert Head, the art c r i t i c , and on that account
he had almost been presented with an honorary deg-
ree under the wrong name, and had almost been re-
fused a visa to the U.S.A.
LETTERS T O T H E EDITOR
Chelsea Physic
Garden.
2?rd May, 1955.
Dear Pete,
Felix issued a challenge last week to the
asking for news. To-day I would like to report from
the Botany Department:-
Pen Diving Attempt at Chelsea.
Sub-Aqua Biology. C'ajfl ••
Volunteer Dives for Parker (51).
Courageously taking up the challenge of fellow stu-
dents to come to the aid of one J. Farthing, who had
dropped his new Parker 5
"
! pen in the lake at Chelsea
Physic Garden, T. Swinburne retreated to the lecture
' room to gather his equipment which he providentially
had with him. Five minutes later emerging from his
changing room in the library, he was given a great ova-
tion by the excited crowd.
A look of anguish crossed his face as he was low-
wered into the greeny black waters teeming with wild
life at LytOO p.m., but gritting his teeth he manfully
carried on and after a bout of malarial shiverings he
began operations, ignoring the taunts of the crowd, and
in particular those of a knowing gentleman :-
"Are you on the bottom?" (Swinburne with head, shou-
lders and chest out of water) "You've got a job on there,
eh?"
"Smells a bit, doan it?"
At -V.J5, after over a hundredweight of rank smelling
black debris had been dredged, the attempt was given up
and the tired diver retired to a hot bath in the Curator's
house*
Five minutes later, M, Kelly amidst cheers held a-
loft the pen which was found near the roots of Calt ha
Palustris.
The entertainment was finished off with a celebra-
tion tea given by Df. Pratt.
A proposal that under-water biology should form part
of future courses was quickly quashed by the frigid Swin-
burne*
Tours sincerely,
Basher.
