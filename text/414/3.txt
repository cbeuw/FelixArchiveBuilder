Remember, remember, the 27th February
-NUS national demo
I M P E R I A L C O L L E G E c l o s e d
down at 12.30pm last F r i d a y .
Ir reopened at 1.30pm, but with
about 60 fewer students; for
F r i d a y 27th February was the
day o f the national demonstra-
tion on grants and education
cuts. A somewhat diminutive
horde gathered outside the
Union building and left at 1.15,
in a specially hired coach.
Although most of I C ignored
the o c c a s s i o n ("I couldn't
strike, I hdd to do some w o r k " ) ,
about 25,000 students from a l l
over England gathered near
Waterloo Station, watched
closely by television cameras,
the National P r e s s and the
D a i l y Telegraph.
There were even several
thousand marchers from the
Metropolitan P o l i c e , who
i n s i s t e d on walking on the
outside of the procession,
presumably in order to appear
on television.
The demonstration marched
from Waterloo Bridge to Hyde
Parte v i a Oxford Street. T h e
column, when it finally set
off, stretched for miles. When
the leaders reached Oxford
C i r c u s , the tail-end was just
crossing Waterloo Bridge.
Not everyone supported u s ,
however: an intrepid reporter
from the Daily Telegraph, the
following day wrote, "The
column of casually - dressed
marchers, brandishing red
banners ... infuriated passers-
by who souted back their own
slogans to the marchers". T h e
"infuriated p a s s e r s - b y " , w a s
an old man with curiously
waving arms who decided,
against h i s wife's advice, to
hold h i s own, individual,
counter-demonstration. He
shouted, according to the
Daily Telegraph, "Go back
to Siberia" and "Get on with
your work". What kind of work
he did, that enabled him to
stand on street corners, at
3.00pm on a Friday afternoon,
shouting at students, gave
rise to much speculation. It
was rumoured that he was a
freelance for the Daily
Telegraph.
When the marchers finally
reached Hyde P a r k , most of
IC made a dramatic swing to
the right and went home,
leaving a couple o f F E L I X
staff and a bemused Hon Sec
(John Downs) to absorb the
speeches.
Casually-dressed C h a r l e s
Clarice made an impassioned,
if not entirely intelligible
speech; "This is the largest
ever demonstration.,.er ...
since last year". He s a i d that
Mr Healey was using "economic
steamroller to crush the life
and humanity out of society"
and Mr C l a r k e , no feather-
weight himself, should know.
Max Morris, president of the
National Union of Teachers
said that it was the first
N U S demonstration to have the
official backing of the N U T .
F i n a l l y , although it may
come as a shock to those I C
students who participated,
(several of whom wore suits),
"moderate students were
conspicuous by their abscenc^
and Lionel Zetter of the
Sussex University Conservative
Association, condemned the
march as just another holiday
event" â€” Daily Telegraph.
Mr Zetter w i l l surely donate
any increase in h i s grant
equally between Conservative
Central Office and the D a i l y
Telegraph fighting fund.
