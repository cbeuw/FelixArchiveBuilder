IC shine in Midlands
Championships
T H E C L U B H E L D a very
encouraging event on
Richmond Park ten days ago.
The combination of good
weather and easy terrain
enabled everyone to run
faster than usual and record
good times.
Steve Webb started first on
the long course and also
finished first. H e recorded a
time of 46 minutes, two
minutes clear of David R o s e n .
Michael Bloom showed a
surprising turn of speed,
coming in thrid ahead of
Miriam Besioby and Ian
Isherwood. Keith Sugden was
troubled by control 8 which
some kids had 'kindly' placed
up a tree, but he had a good
run up to that point.
niOn the short course, Henry
Adams was the c l e a r winner —
he was trying the sport for
the first time. Diane Benge
was next with Matthew C4ements
only three minutes behind.
L u c k i l y , neither of these two
were disturbed by another
vandalised control point.
At the weekend Alan
Leakey and David Rosen
competed in the Midlands
championships held in
Cheshire. Out of a large field
of 150, David came 3rd, putting
him in line for the British
Team, whilst A l a n did well to
achieve a silver standard.
The next club fixture w i l l
be the H A V O C Badge Event
in E s s e x on March 14th. Come
to the club meetings on
F r i d a y s at 12.30pm in Beit
57 to find out more details.

F O R T H E second week
running there was a full team
of ladies — this time firmly
under the control?) of umpire
Balderson. The late arrival
of the opposition enabled some
pre-match tactical d i s c u s s i o n s
to take place. 'Beaverwood'
and ' R o l l e r b a l l ' were but two
of the devious passwords
thought up to baffle the
opposition.
When play started IC
immediately began'to pressurize
the Bart's goal and it wasn't
long before they were 1—0 up,
thanks to super-star-Sarah
trying hard for a jug in her
last league appearance (Aaahl).
But Barts were not so e a s i l y
'conned' and despite the
valiant efforts of 'sock it to
'em sproatesy' in the goal,
they soon e q u a l i s e d . However
they were somewhat unprepared
for our next move (which,
surprisingly enough, hadn't
been d i s c u s s e d before the
game). Ms Horn suddenly felt
the need to get undressed on
the pitch, and amid startled
cries of "I dn't want it, my
ruddy skirt's coming off", the
opposition could only stand
and stare while Sarah ran
regardless up the field and
slammed the ball into the back
of the net. IC were now
beginning to take command
and Janet took advantage of
this to put us 3—1 up at half
time.
Being overcome by actually
being in the lead could perhaps
explain why IC began to 'fade'
in the second half. Bart's
scored a second goal from a
corner and equalised shortly
afterwards. We fought on —
Sarah tried all ways (not that
she could think of many more!)
for her jug, but it was not to
be and we had to be satisfied
with a draw. But this must be
progress; from loosing 9—0 in
our first two matches we have
definitely improved throughout
the season.
Team:- E Sproates, L McLardie,
J Orchard, R White, 'W, C
Forsyth, J Coxage, E Hammer-
sley, T Pearson, D Mounsey

C l u b held its first ever treasure
hunt/rally on Sunday, 22nd
February. It met in the country
lanes of Sussex bounded by
the A24 and A 2 3 . After a
skirmish at the J o l l y Farmer,
the entrants assembled for a
pinf and some lunch at the
Barley Mow on the A 2 5 near
Buckland. Competitors were
sent off at 5 minute intervals
into unknown territory with a
list of clues and treasure to
find. The finish was at the
R i s i n g Sun near Horsham.
On the basis of some
heated d i s c u s s i o n at the end
of the rally, it seemed that at
least two of the c l u e s were
inaccurate. Despite that, all
but N i c k James managed to
find their way to the finish
without opening the sealed
envelope containing a rough
map of the course.
Winners were Rob Bracken
and John Redfern on a 750cc
Norton who received two thirds
of the entrance money kitty.
Second were Bob Longman
and N i g e l Bamber on a 650cc
Triumph who received one
third of.the kitty. How B o b
did 84 m i l e s when the course
was only 20 miles long, heaven
knows!

WE H A D a rousing send-off
on Saturday, crowds waving
and cheering, led by IC
President Pete Teague.
Unfortunately, our travelling
supporters (all 50,000 of them),
adorned in blue and white were
diverted somewhere in North
London and didn't make the
match.
When we arrived, a grubby
green-finger pointed somewhat
vaguely to the middle of a
series of h i l l s i d e ploughed
f i e l d s .
A s is the custom in these
rural matches, the agricultural
crowd always manage to play
downhill in the first half. A s
soon as the whistle went they
all charged down the hill and
the local manure merchant
The weather was mild and
occasionally sunny although
we had about 5 minutes d r i z z l e .
The treasure consisted of
greenery culled from the hedge-
rows, some of which proved to
be uncomfortable to certain
parts of the body when placed
in the front trouser pocket.
There was no time limit to the
event.
Everyone thoroughly enjoyed
it, and the event's huge s u c c e s s
means there shall be more
treasure h u n t / r a l l i e s in the
future.

playfully tossed the ball to
Roger in goal. Not wishing to
dirty his pads, he moved out
the way and we were 1—0
down.
After this temporary set-
back there was no holding

been a lot higher had it not
