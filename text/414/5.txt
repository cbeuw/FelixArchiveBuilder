Socialist Democracy
Question of apathy
Sir, — I wish to comment on
the subject of apathy and
participation at this c o l l e g e .
At IC we have a wide spectrum
of people from different
cultures, backgrounds and
with different interests. A
large proportion of these
people participate in various
clubs and societies —
to verify this you only have
to go round and ask people
which, if any, of the organ-
isations they participate i n .
However, for each individual
organisation, there are only
relatively few active members
compared with the total
population of the C o l l e g e .
T h i s a p p l i e s to major
organisations such as ICU
and the C C U ' s a s well as to
the individual clubs and
s o c i e t i e s which form the A C C ,
R C C and S C C . T h i s is because,
to reap the benefits of
active involvement in any one
club, one must devote
sufficient time to it w h i c h ,
to a very large degree, must
result in exclusion of
participation in other organ-
isations.
Hence, it i s only to be
expected that a minority of
students actively support
ICU and the C C U ' s , because
despite having a more general
relevance and appeal to
CoMege members compared to
s p e c i f i c appeal of the other
organisations, these Unions
too are limited. F o r example,
if a union organises a concert
or a bar night, only those
people interested in that
particular form of entertain-
Elections
Sir, — We would like to express
our extreme disgust and
contempt for the immature
election style of Mr Everett's
campaign.
Surely a candidate should
concentrate on h i s own
proposed p o l i c i e s and the
reasons why he considers
himself suitable for the
relevant post, instead of
indulging, what amounts to,
"mud sI inging''.
Rather than furthering
his cause through his
campaign, he has merely
raised doubts, in our minds,
as to h i s suitability for the
demanding post of Deputy
President.
Yours faithfully,

ment will attend, that i s ,
people who like the particular
type of music played or who
like drinking a lot.
T h i s causes the unions to
be dominated by a certain
type of person and leads to
the formation of c l i q u e s .
Thus, through involvement in
other clubs resulting in a
lack of time, the lack in
appeal of much of what the
Union does and the formation
of union c l i q u e s , it is not
surprising that the " a v e r a g e "
IC student becomes apathetic
towards h i s union.
The situation is worse at
IC than at other universities
due to the large proportion of
postgraduates, and overseas
students whose presence
creates a larger spectrum of
needs to be covered — thus
students form c l i q u e s in their
departments and amongst
their own countrymen. How-
ever, this state of affairs
cannot be blamed on the
unions — it would be impossible
for them to arrange events
which would appeal to
everyone.
I would like to finish on a
note aimed at those a c t i v i s t s
who often point an accusing
finger at the non-participating
majority. How many of them
participate in other s o c i e t i e s
to the degree of attempting to
reduce the stranglehold of
cliquesandproviding incentives
for them to get involved* in
union a c t i v i t i e s ?
Yours faithful ly,

T h i s role was held to
that of providing a c f i t i c a T .
elite whose c r i t i c i s m s , of the
system and society as a
whole would be constructive
rather than destructive.
In a free ranging debate,
during the evening within
sub-groups and during the
following afternoon as a
whole group, the conclusion
was reached that IC was
neither of the two cultures
mentioned. The type of
culture it should have w a s
eventually not decided upon,
but various rituals and
such like were proposed.
The main idea here being to
evolve a totally new culture
for the C o l l e g e .
C O M M U N I S T S are often
accused of being undemo-
cratic, of trying to overthrow
governments elected by the
people {perhaps violently)
— but, is this true?
In Western European
countries Communist parties
take part in Parliamentary
elections and considerable
popular support is expressed
in some countries (France and
Haly are examples). In none
of these countries do the
Communist parties advocate
the seizure of power (by
armed means or otherwise)
by small " s u b v e r s i v e " groups
op people. However, they
also believe that the present
system of Parliamentary
democracy is not the ultimate
expression of people's
interests.
We enjoy democratic
rights for the mass of people
at present — but only because
of continued struggle —
rights such a s housing,
edgcation, health, picketing,
racial and sexual equality,
the right to work e t c . These
are by no means assured and
God given — look at the
current cuts by Mr Healey.
These rights must be defended
and extended, ultimately into
areas where they do not
exist at present, for example,
at the place of work where
workers are at the mercy of
non-elected factory owners,
and thus, finally to S o c i a l i s m .
It is no accident that in
countries where there is a
minimum of democracy, such
as Spain, or Portugal before
April 1974, Communists are
in the fore front to end these
regimes, for free trade union
organisation and democratic
e l e c t i o n s .
A h , you s a y , what about
the Soviet Union, what does
democracy have to do with
the bureaucratic and administ-
rative suppression of dissenting
v i e w s ? It i s essential to
point out that these anti-
s o c i a l i s t acts are in no way
intrinsic to the ideals of
S o c i a l i s m . Stalinism is not
historically i n e v i t a b l e ,
e s p e c i a l l y in Britain where
we have such strong demo-
cratic traditions. It • i s ,
rather, s p e c i f i c to a country
which attempted to build a
new society in very difficult
historical conditions and
which, s i n c e it was the first,
and in that sense an experiment,
made many mistakes.
T h i s in no way excludes
the possibility of a peaceful
democratic transition to
S o c i a l i s m in Britain — the
only lasting democracy.
