Social security: the latest
The future
Last week the long
awaited new arrangements
for students claiming s o c i a l
security were announced. For
the academic year 1976—7, the
" v a c a t i o n element" of the
undergraduate grant w i l l be
taken to cover the Xmas and
Easter vacations, but not
the summer. Hence in the
summer you w i l l be able to
claim full benefit without
any deduction. In the shorter
vacations you w i l l be
receiving, as grant, the
equivalent of the s o c i a l
benefit for a single non-
householder (£8.70 at present).
T h i s implies a student living
at home for the vacations
wiII, not be entitled to
benefit. However, the 'new'
vacation element does not
include provision for rent.
This arrangement w i l l be
reviewed again for the
academic vear (1977—8)
The present
The above does not come
into effect until October 1976
and the same system as
before applies for this Easter
and summer (that i s , if you
go home for the vacation
you receive benefit less the
.vacation grant of £3.18).
Alternatively, if you stay up
and pay rent you receive
benefit plus your rent less
£3.18. Your rent may not be
paid in full if it is considered
to be too high.
The currant rates of
benefit are:
Married couple - £17.75
Single householder (ie rent
payer - £10.90
Person in d i g s ' - Board and.
lodging fee plus £3.50
Anyone e l s e over 18 (eg
student living at home) - £8.70
An English President?
Y e s , election fever is
hitting all of u s . Next Wed-
nesday we shall be electing
officers for next year's
committee. A l l candidates,
who should sign up on the
Southside Basement notice-
board, need one proposer and
two seconders. It must be
stressed that all members of
the C o l l e g e can stand for any
post, including non-members
of the society and non-
C h i n e s e . For those of you not
familiar with the society, our
chief aims are the promotion
of C h i n e s e culture and s o c i a l -
isation amongst our members.
Itn order to achieve these aims
we need a committee who can
collectively organise functions
and individually shoulder the
responsibilities of their
posts. It is not necessary to
know about Chinese culture
(although it is useful) or to
be able to speak one of the
many dialects — in fact
being of a non-Chinese
culture could enrich both the
social and cultural aspects
of the society and present a
less formidable front to
non-Chinese people. If you
are interested in standing for
a post, the present committee
are available for consultation
in the J C R at lunchtimes.
The remaining events of the
term are a film show, which
follows the elctions, and a
sherry party to be held on
Thursday 18th March. T h i s
latter event is for the
introduction of the newly
elected committee to the
society and will be followed
by a d i s c o at which present-
ation of the trophies to the
winners of the various L U C S C S
games w i l l take p l a c e .
Touchstone
T H E L A S T Touchstone
weekend of this session has
also' proved to be the last
under the chairmanship of
Mr Kenneth M c D o w a l l . Mr
McDowall who has chaired
the d i s c u s s i o n weekends at
Silwood Park since it was
first started 26 years ago
thought it was time he
stepped off and allowed
someone e l s e to take over.
H i s replacement w i l l be Mr
Eric Stables.
Mr McDowall was presented
with a book on Durer by the
Touchstone regulars and
with a bottle of whisky by

He will be continuing his
E n g l i s h c l a s s e s with overseas
students at L S E and has

Negotiations for setting up a

his main preoccupation w i l l
be with the "Illiteracy
C a m p a i g n " , a topic of very,
great interest to him.
Many Touchstone w i l l be
sad to see him . g o . H e
brought to Touchstone the
necessary element of " s t i r "
and witto stimulate d i s c u s s i o n
on even after the most boring
of speakers. Last year he
was made an Honorary
A s s o c i a t e of the C o l l e g e in
recognition of his s e r v i c e s
to the C o l l e g e in the field
of A s s o c i a t e d Studies.
The topic for d i s c u s s s i o n
on this o c c a s i o n was "Imperial
College - Airport Culture or
C o m m u n i t y ? " Dr Sinclair
Goodlad, of STOIC fame,
gave a very interesting
discourse on the subject.
H i s main concern was to try
and discover what type of
social institution Imperial
C o l l e g e really was and what
it ought to be.
To do this, he chose two
widely disimilar " c u l t u r e s "
as guides; namely, "Airport
C u l t u r e " and " M o n a s t i c
C u l t u r e " . From these basic
ideas, he went on to talk
about the s o c i a l foci of
these- cultures, their effects
on the people within these
cultures, and to ask the
question: "What is the role
of university within s o c i e t y " .
