Victory for Hospital
Imperial College 7
London Hospital 15
F O R T H E F I R S T time In its
long history the Gutteridge
Cup has two holders in one
season; or more or less had!
A few days after reaching the
final Paul Robins (the IC c a p -
tain) was informed by U L U that
London Hospital felt t h e m -
s e l v e s to be unable to play on
the day designated because a
long—standing fixture con fl icted.
That, by default, gave IC the
cup. But, in the circumstances
there was no pleasure in
obtaining it. T h i s unsatisfactory
situation remained for a few
days until there was a phone
c a l l from London Hospital to
say that, after a l l , they could
play on that date if IC would
agree. IC, s t i 11 k e y e d up
emotionally for t h e f i n a l , found
no difficulty in agreeing.
IC made the journey to
Motspur Park accompanied by
about 50 sopporters intent upon
winning the cup for the 12th
time s i n c e 1951. Shortly before
the kick—off a touch of colour
was added to the scene by the
arrival of further support c o m -
plete withJez. A q u i c k ' A V i v o '
led by P e t e Teague confirmed
the superiority of the IC support.
The game opened with I C
playing into the wind. They
started well by winning the first
scrum against the head . I C ' s
d o m i n a n c e in the pack
continued throughout. In the
opening minutes • London
Hospital pressed IC back and
got their reward when, after
nine minutes, their full-back
kicked the first of his four
penalties. Twenty-five minutes
into the first half saw London
Hospital 9:0 in front, having
added a penalty and a drop goal
to their previous s c o r e J C c a m e
back into the game and
dominated the remainder of
the half. During this period
IC missed three crucial
penalties and halt time
arrived with IC 9:0 down,
all of their attacks having
been foiled by the accurate
Kicking of the London
Hospital scrum half and
full back.
IC put the pressure on
from the stari of the second
half and within three minutes
were awarded a penalty which
Andy Devaney converted.
The pressure on London
Hospital continued. IC were
now playing the best rugby
of the game. The pack con-
sistently won the bali in the
loose and Terry Fearn passed
the ball freely to the b a c k s .
At times IC were c l o s e to
scoring: no-one came c l o s e r
than P h i l Turley. However,
no move was carried to
fruition. After twenty-two
minutes London Hospital
broke out. I C ' s covering
back was good but a crooked
feed into the resulting
scrum conceded a penalty.
That gave London Hospital a
lead of 12:3. That lead
was increased to 15:3 five
minutes later. IC came back
with a vengence and in the
following five minutes both
Steve Booth and Keith
Lipscombe were unlucky not
to score. The pressure did
result in a try and that was
scored by Adrain Williams
following a penalty on the
right wing. It was a just
reward as Adrain had caused
all sorts of problems for
London Hospital during the-
game. An exciting ten minutes
followed but there was no
further scoring despite the
valiant efforts of John Smith
and Paul R o b i n s . It was all
to late.
It could be^ argued that it
was really a moral victory for
IC as they scored the only fry
of the game, but the cup
went to London Hospital
because of their consistent
IN A T H R I L L I N G final
against Hackney Bus Garage,
IC clinched the London
B u s i n e s s H o u s e s League
after finishing runners-up
the previous year.
The match against Hackney
was a double" banker from
which i C needed to take
five out of the possible s i x
points to be assured of the
championship, (each team
c o n s i s t s of three players
and each match c o n s i s t s of
three frames each, a point
being awarded to the winner
of each game.)
P h i l Chester and Steve
Well both won their matches,
but John Healy playing with
a borrowed cue (his cue
having been stolen the
night before) lost his first
match. However, he won his

k i c k i n g . IC took too long to
settle into a confident
rhythm. If they had played
during the second half
victory could have been
theirs. However, it was an
entertaining and exciting
game between two very good
fifteens. Both sides emerged
with credit.
Hearty thanks are due to
the IC Supporters contingent
whose vociferous support
was appreciated by the team.

second match after a tremend-
ous struggle.
This championship was
made possible by some fine
performances earlier in the
season: notably the two
victories over J D Burns who
were the other main challengers
for the league. Charlie Y a t e s ,
tne team's regular No. 3, was
unable to play in the last
four m a t c h e s . o f the season,
but his two victories over
the City of London P o l i c e
helped keep IC in contention.
P h i l Chesters who has
played at No. 1 for the ' B '
team for the last two years,
has in that time only lost
one match and he is probably
the main reason for the
C o l l e g e team •being such a
strong force in the London
B u s i n e s s Houses League.

ON S A T U R D A Y 21st of
February Imperial C o l l e g e
L a c r o s s e C l u b set off to
Epping Forest. Being able to
use the A C C van, (thanks to
Mike Burke for driving! it made
this epic journey much easier
than in previous years. And
with the C a p t a i n ' s impeccable
navigation)?) we only got
lost once.
So we arrived, on time,
but with only eight players.
Still we were looking forward
to a fairly enjoyable game, as
Buckhurst H i l l are one of the
friendliest clubs in the south
of E n g l a n d ; and we got one.
The first quarter was a
typical start, in which neither
side dominated the other and
the attack and defence found
out who were the opposition's
danger men. At the end of the
first quarter IC led by 3—2.
T h i s actually helped boost
I C ' s confidence, as we were
ex pec t i ng to be com prehen s i ve I y
hammered, B u c k s having a man
advantage.
However the second
quarter was a bit of a blow.
A s usual we got a bit lax in
our marking and fighting for
the b a l l . Greasy Pete in
goal did a good job and kept
the score down to 6—4 for
B u c k s at half time.
In the third quarter the
attack and in particular
Richard Forster and Derek
Senner did a lot of fine work,
and both managed to get on the
score sheet. Meanwhile the
defence did a solid job and
didn't give away a single
goal. After the third quarter
IC led by 7 - 6 . It was good to
see Rob Morrison in defence
do so well in his first game.
After this amazing come
back (a rare occurrence)
Efrem Zimbalist Junior Mark
II put the match out of Buck-
hurst H i l l s reach by scoring
four goals in as many minutes.
Then it was just a c a s e of the
defence trying to stop B u c k s
from scoring, while the attack
got back every goal IC
conceded. In the last quarter
Greasy Pete in goal got a
bruise on his arm, which he
insisted I mention in the
report. Some people are proud
about the s i l l i e s t things.
One thing that does deserve
a mention is the last goal of
the match. T h i s was one of
the best moves of the game In
which J Edgar Hoover Mark II
gained p o s s e s s i o n , ran
towards goal and passed!') to
Derek Senner who had run
round the back of the defence
and slotted the ball home.
F i n a l score 1 4 - 1 0 In I C ' s
favour. Didn't we do w e l l ?
