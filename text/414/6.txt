suspense. Rest assured however, this
refrains from indulging in the e x c e s s e s
common to many Hammer f i l m s . Blood
is let sparingly.
A s occult phenomena are not normally
encountered by most people, the burden
of making a Satanic theme believeable
is considerable; the onus rests chiefly
with the actors. Christopher L e e , having
played many bizzare and macabre
characters previously, is well suited to
the part of Father Michael, an ex-
communicated priest who forms a convent
devoted to the worship of the d e v i l -
figure of Lord Astorath. He plays the
part convincingly but with a dignity
which would not, one imagines, be
found in an unfrocked priest.
A s his adversary, combating the
forces of E v i l , Richard Widmark has
the harder role. It is difficult to make
a character good without being nauseat-
ingly virtuous, he overcomes this prgblem
by instilling in the character a ruthless
practicality.
Aided by brisk direction, the film

A s the plot is fictitious it would be
unwise to draw any profound c o n c l u s i o n s

reality. However one is left with the
impression that such activities are
revolting in the extreme.

it is interesting that the agents of the

The supporting cast fare very w e l l :
Anthony Valentine demonstrates that he
is a capable actor and worthy of better
roles than the supercilious barrister

Together with Honor B l a c k m a n , who
plays his lover, they add an element
