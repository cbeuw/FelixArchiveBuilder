A close scrape for Nick
Dracula and
Casanova
on STOIC
N E X T TUESDAY, STOIC are

"Film Talk" series with
Christopher Lee as their
guest. Mr Lee was inter-
viewed last year at Hammer
House while he was making
his latest film " T o the
Devil ... A Daughter". (For
a review of this film which is

page six.) Clips from this
film are included in the
programme together with
excerpts from "The Man with
the Golden . G u n " , "The
Three Musketeers" and
"Scars of Dracula".

found acting outside the
Albert Hall last Monday. Mr
Philips was working on his
latest film, "Not Now
Comrade".
STOIC hounds are quickly
on the scene to nab him for a
short impromptu interview. The
interview will be shown during
the last "lunchbreak" of
tenn on 18th March.
IC Radio
gets
licence
A F T E R WAITING for nearly
two years, Imperial College
Radio has finally been
granted a test licence to
begin operating. The licence
will cost £300 and will be
renewable thereafter on a
yearly basis at the cost of
£150 a year.
The licience allows IC
Radio to make single tone
transmissions only. A
spokesman for IC Radio said
that they hoped to make
test transmissions by June.
Their first aim would be to
transmit programmes to
NICK B R A Y S H A W is the
new president of ICU for
the 1976-7 s e s s i o n . The
r e s u l t was officially
declared at the Union
General Meeting held
yesterday In the Great
H a l l .
It was no walkover,
however; on the first count,
Mr Brayshaw had 550 first
preference votes, Mr Fitzgerald
488 and Mr Miller 132. As the
required quota had not been
reached, Mr Miller's votes
were re-allocated according
to the STV system and Nick
Brayshaw narrowly scraped
home by about 20 votes. The
total number of votes cast
was 1229.
In the election for Editor
of F E L I X , Clive Dewey
passed the quota on the first
count by 622 votes to
453 for Duncan Suss. To
complete the set, Derek
Everett was elected Deputy
President by 844 votes to
Chris Kourouniotis' 177.
Southside and Linstead.
The system IC Radio propose
to use was described as
"technically perfectly feasible"
three weeks ago by a GPO
engineer.
Once the system is set
up and is operational the
GPO will check it to see
whether it conforms to two
basic requirements. These
are that there is no inter-
ference with existing GPO
lines on campus and that
transmissions cannot be
heard outside the campus.
Pete Teague, Nick Bray-
shaw, Tony Fitzgerald,
Derek Everett and Rick Parker
were elected as delegates
to the NUS Easter conference,
with Hugh Barrett, Adrain
Sudworth and Nigel Miller
elected as observers.
Having dealt with the
main elections, the meeting
proceeded with the agenda,
passing a constitutional
change concerning the
election of SCAB chairman.
The motions to be put to
NUS conference were prior-
itized, the first four being, in
order of precedence, Welfare,
NUS constitution, Education
and Hall Fees.
A motion on welfare was
passed, and was followed
by a motion on Hall Fees.
The meeting felt that it would
be unwise to subsidise Hall
rents in the long term, as
this would penalise those
students living outside
college accommodation.
Motions on direct elections,
grants and education cuts
were passed and the meeting
closed with the election of
several Union officers. Hugh
Barrett was elected External
Affairs Officer and a fresh-
faced newcomer P Ekpenyong
was elected Academic Affairs
Officer.
