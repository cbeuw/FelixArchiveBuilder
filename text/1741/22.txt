Lo-Fi Beats Are Trash, You Deserve Better
Music Editor Guthrie Ruby tells you why your taste is bad and you should feel bad. Also, how to study to music

I
like to think I’m quite
optimistic about
music. It is a very
subjective medium
and almost any piece of
music can have value to
anyone. But I draw the
line at lo-fi beat compi-
lations. Using lo-fi beats
as study music should
be considered a cardinal
sin. Walking through any
library, you see the vast
majority of people with
their headphones on. The
idea that a single person is
plugged into “Lo-Fi beats
to relax/study to” sends a
shiver down my spine.
Recently, someone
recommended a lo-fi
study compilation to me
that I hated so intensely
it inspired me to write
this. Though before I sat
down to rant and rave
about “Lo-Fi beats to
relax/study to” I thought
it’d be good to know if
studying and listening to
music should even happen
simultaneously. So, I did
some research (aka pro-
crastination).
The most commonly
known music induced
intelligence phenomenon
is the “Mozart Effect”, but
it’s often misunderstood.
Listening to Mozart does
not inherently make you
smarter. Listening to
music that puts you in a
good mood before a study
sesh improves memory
and mental functioning
for a short period of time.
This can be any kind of
music. All those people
that ‘oNLy LisTN tO
clAsSicAL mUsIc wHilE
sTUdyInG’ can get off
their high horse.
So, before you sit down
in front of your screen
be sure to bust out the
bangers that boost your
mood.
When it comes to
music while studying
there are just a few simple
dos and don’ts to prevent
it becoming detrimental:
• Avoid music with
lyrics. If you’re
working with
numbers this is less
of a problem, but if
you’re reading or
writing this is a big
no no.
• Aggressive/chaotic
music is generally
going to distract
you and has been
shown to greatly
reduce focus.
• Moderate/steady
music is the best
v i b e to go for
(which might make
you think that lo-fi
beats are good but
don’t worry I’ll get
to that later).
• Monotonous/repet-
itive music should
be avoided, it’ll
end up putting you
to sleep.
• Keep the volume to
a minimum. You’re
probably already
in a library so you
don’t need it loud.
• If you’re doing
m e m o r i s a t i o n
work, it’s gener-
ally best to not be
listening to music
at all. Got a stack
of flashcards to run
through? Cut the
music and make it
a treat in between
decks.
Despite having just
laid out rules to follow,
the advice of the experts
is that “it depends”.
Music that improves your
mood also improves your
mental functioning and
endurance. So, taking 20
minutes to listen to some
Kendrick or Bowie might
help you stick around in
the library for an extra
hour. Maybe adding a few
KAYTRANADA bops
to your queue is going to
make that lecture you’ve
been putting off a little
less miserable. Only you
can say what’s best for
you.
Okay, so if listening to
music while studying is
not a bad thing, then why
is listening to lo-fi beats
the worst?
I don’t want to come
across too harsh. As stated
before, music is subjec-
tive. If you love “Lo-Fi
beats to relax/study to”,
then by all means don’t let
my hatred of it get in your
way. Objectively though
it’s bad and you should
stop.
If you’re going to
lifelessly spend endless
hours of your youth in
front of a computer screen
indoors, you might as
well give that a decent
soundtrack. Don’t listen
to shitty music designed
to lack originality, be for-
Look at all the amazing things you could be listening to instead // Respective Record Labels
gettable and not engage.
You wouldn’t do this to
any of your other senses.
Imagine how much of a
lunatic you would be if
you ate plain pasta while
studying so that you
wouldn’t get distracted.
Is that the kind of world
you want to live in? Next
time I walk into Tesco
I expect to see a “white
bread and cucumber
sandwich to study/relax
to” on the shelves. Please
don’t rot your brain with
flavourless sound. Turn
the music off if you think
you’re getting distracted.
To be fair, sometimes
certain situations call
for bland music. Lo-fi
“If you’re
going to
lifelessly
spend endless
hours of your
youth in front
of a computer
screen indoors,
you might
as well give
that a decent
soundtrack.”
