The Lighthouse (2019)
With a UK release on 31st January, Film has its take on the Academy Award nominated film that’s had all the
critics talking.
A
fter the
critical and
c o m m e r c i a l
success of The
Witch, writer/director
Robert Eggers presents
his second film The
Lighthouse, an intimate
psychological horror. On
an isolated island off the
coast of New England
in the late 19th century,
Ephraim Winslow (Robert
Pattinson) arrives on a
four-week contract to
work for the old light-
house keeper Thomas
Wake (Willem Dafoe). In
such a desolate and harsh
environment, paranoia
can get the better of men.
Immediately, I appreci-
ated the craftmanship that
has intricately welded the
film together. This film
looks incredible. Opting
to shoot in black and white
35mm with a boxy aspect
ratio, the cinematography
and the arresting visuals
reminisces the period
setting. Versatile shifts
from claustrophobic
indoor scenes and ex-
pansive seascapes are
effective despite the
squarish frame. The
handling of light is im-
portant in a film titled The
Lighthouse—especially
the murky night scenes
where characters’ faces
are perfectly captured
beautifully. Eggers im-
pressively directs each
shot for maximum impact
on the viewer.
Based loosely on an
unfinished Edgar Allen
Poe short story, The Light-
house emulates the feeling
of reading poetry— a
haunting meditation on
guilt dressed up as a
horror film. In essence,
the film is a descent into
madness, but disappoint-
ingly doesn’t seem to
do much more than that.
After sanity is given the
discharge notice, in enters
the bizarre; unlike the
high contrast monochro-
matic look, the absurdist
development of the plot
are many shades of grey
and it’s up to us how we
interpret it. This can feel
frustrating and unsatisfy-
ing at times, but is never
“The
Lighthouse
emulates
the feeling
of reading
poetry— a
haunting
meditation on
guilt dressed
up as a horror
film”
“If there were
a prize for eye-
acting, Dafoe
and Pattinson
would be
equally worthy
of the award”
boring to watch; moments
of intermittent humour
are well balanced and
provide humanity to the
characters. The film has a
beautiful fairy-tale lilt; su-
perstitions about seagulls
being the souls of sailors,
traumatic dreams steeped
in shame and foreshad-
owing curses. This tone
is complemented by the
abstract mystical visuals,
that is best left to wash
over you.
The brooding score is
nuanced, often blending
into the omnipresent
foghorn in the back-
ground. It creeps along
with the story, providing
an ambient backdrop
but takes centre stage
in climactic moments
effectively. The sound
design is particularly
impressive too, with
deafening and oppressive
soundscapes that grab you
by the throat, and strange
chilling distortion effects
that complement the gro-
tesque visuals.
As for the performanc-
es, they are great and
surprisingly understated.
Both Dafoe and Pattin-
son exude confidence
as performers working
with such unconventional
material, fully fleshing
out the characters. Eggers
gives them individual
opportunities to shine;
Dafoe and Pattinson are at
the top of their game , but
they don’t appear to be
the pretentious Oscar-bait
type of performances,
which is why they didn’t
get the recognition they
deserved. If there were
a prize for eye-acting,
chilling moments and
visceral imagery but it
didn’t get under my skin.
On a purely cinematic
level, The Lighthouse
absolutely satisfies—it
is a film to be seen on
the biggest screen with
the loudest sound system
because it encapsulates
a retrospective artistic
approach to filmmaking
that is rare in modern
cinema. The framing
and cinematography also
evoke old photography
and silent films. There’s
a slight issue with the
accents and dialogue of
the actors that are sup-
posedly authentic of the
period. It is borderline
incomprehensible in some
parts and I found it hard
work to decipher each
sentence. Because of this
I couldn’t quite infuse into
the movie as the filmmak-
ers intended.
In its setting, dialogue
and a plot steeped in
mysticism and folklore, it
garners the flavours of a
Shakespeare tragedy, but
simultaneously is a cine-
matic experience. It is like
seeing poetry onscreen
but was slightly incom-
plete for me as a piece of
narrative filmmaking.

THE LIGHTHOUSE
Dafoe and Pattinson
would be equally worthy
of the award.
The Lighthouse is not
the factory farmed awards
season film at all. This
film is easy to admire
but difficult to enjoy. As
a horror film, there are
“This film is
easy to admire

That said, The Light-
house is an impressive
work by writer-director
Robert Eggers, and credit
must also be given to
A24, the beating heart of
modernAmerican cinema.
