decent amount – so for the
$20 price point I would
say it’s a fair purchase
for any fan of the Tactics
genre.
Zombie Army 4: Dead
War
Zombie Army is a
series of games developed
and published by Rebel-
lion Developments, and
acts as a spin-off to the
highly acclaimed Sniper
Elite series. Zombie
Army Trilogy released in
2015 piled together the
Nazi Zombie DLC for
Sniper Elite along with an
unreleased 3rd instalment.
After its success, Zombie
army 4 was announced
as the sequel to Zombie
Army Trilogy and the first
standalone game released
in the series. The story
is relatively uninspired,
taking place in an alter-
native universe where at
the end of WWII Hitler
deployed a last resort plan
to raise the dead and turn
them against the allies.
Unlike the other games
in this list, I actually had
a chance to play Zombie
Army 4 at Comicon last
October (they even gave
me a cool bottle opener
#freemerch). Me and a
friend played through a bit
of the start of the game,
the gameplay is fluid and
the customisation avail-
able is quite impressive,
however it is no walk in
the park. We got royally
punished for going in
guns blazing, with limited
ammo and a relatively
low health pool, this game
feels much more for the
hardcore gamer that wants
to sink themselves into a
challenge, whether solo or
co-op. While not a heavy
hitter that everyone is
talking about, if you are
a fan of zombie games in
the vein of COD Zombies,
I would check this one out
– coming to PC, PS4 and
Xbox One on February
4th.
Mega Man Zero/ZX
Legacy Collection
On February 25th,
the Mega man Zero/
ZX Legacy Collection
is coming to… basically
everything (except mobile
obviously). I, for one,
am completely biased
in saying this is going to
be amazing. It contains
Mega Man Zero 1, 2, 3, 4,
ZX and ZX Advent. All of
this for £25 is an absolute
steal, it even comes with a
save feature for all those
extra tricky parts… I’m
looking at you, spikes. In
these games you get to
play as Zero, a long-haired
robot boy, as you hack and
slash your way through
levels, trying to fight a
war between the humans
and the Reploids. It is
far more action-oriented
then the traditional Mega
Man games and, in my
opinion, far harder. The
challenge at sometimes
does feel unfair, but the
sense of satisfaction you
gain from getting over
the hurdle of each game
is immense. If you have
never had the chance to
play these phenomenal
games, now is the perfect
time. Whatever platform
you choose to game on,
you now have access and
I cannot recommend it
enough.
Street Fighter V
Champion Edition
Everyone and their
mum, and their dog,
Street Fighter V, but want
a way of getting all the
DLC, you can purchase
the upgrade kit for £25.
This gives you access to
everything that is availa-
ble in Champion Edition,
without having to buy a
new game or all the DLC
separately.
Other Games
There are some more
releases that I didn’t think
were worth dedicating
whole paragraphs to.
Romance of the Three
Kingdoms XIV is a CIV
like turn based strategy
game that utilises a
hexagon layout. Rune
Factory 4 Special, a
Fantasy JRPG with town
building mechanics, is
the newest instalment in
the Rune Factory series
with upgraded CG and
new difficulty levels,
Rune Factory was a big
inspiration for Stardew
valley, so if you are a fan
of that (who isn’t) then
I’d recommend checking
it out. Monster Energy
Supercross is a high
octane, fast paced racing
game that looks to be a lot
of fun. If you forget the
branded name, this looks
to be a pretty solid entry
for racing games with
a focus on motocross,
which we don’t often see.
So, there you have it.
There are plenty of games
coming out this month,
the majority of which
are lower budget titles.
It’s a month that gives
us a chance to breathe,
go through our backlog
and maybe pick up some
games that pique our
interest. Personally, I am
most excited for Dreams
and Mega Man Zero/
ZX Legacy Collection,
but this month really has
something for everyone
– whether you enjoy
strategy, action platform-
ers, shooters or fighting
games.
Street Fighter V: Champion Edition is coming to both PS4 and PC on the 14th - Valentine’s is best experienced with a hadouken // Capcom

“Everyone and
their mum
and their dog
knows about
Street Fighter”
knows what Street Fighter
is. This release, coming
to the PS4 and PC on
February 14th, is the
most complete version of
Street Fighter V. It has all
the DLC (bar a few pro
tour/brand collaboration
costumes), meaning 40
fighters, 34 stages and
over 200 costumes. I am
yet to own Street Fighter
V, so I am definitely going
to jump into this. At £30 it
is a fair price especially if
you are yet to buy Street
Fighter V, standard or
arcade edition. Addition-
