protein-coding
genes.
W
hether it
be Cthulu,
the Kraken,
the Dragon
of the Deep, or even the
nice, friendly one living
in Hogwarts’ Great
Lake; the giant squid has
fascinated the human
mind for centuries. Now
a team at Copenhagen
University, together with
Caroline Albertin at the
United States’ Marine
Biology Laboratory, has
sequenced its genome in a
bid to unpick the science
behind its secrets. How
did it evolve to be so
big? Why did it develop
the biggest brain of any
invertebrate alive today?
First sighted in 1848 by
the crew of the Daedalus
in the waters just off the
Cape of Good Hope, the
giant squid took its first
tentative strokes out of
folklore; although the
scientific world was not
yet ready to be convinced.
Danish zoologist Japetus
Steenstrup took up the
challenge, drawing on
biological knowledge –
only a few washed up,
oversized squid ‘beaks
and pieces’ in evidence
– to propose a believable
giant squid-like animal
truly existing behind the
legends. He gave the
animal the name Archi-
teuthis dux, and by the
1880s, after the discovery
of several dead specimens
across the world’s oceans,
the giant squid stepped
out of fiction and became
fact.
However, the giant
squid is hardly much
more understood today
than in those first, early
days of discovery in the
1800s. It wasn’t until
2004 that the first photos
were taken; and 2006
when video footage of one
floating near the surface
was first recorded. It took
until 2012 for substantial
footage of the beast in
action to be shot, and it
was only last year that the
second footage of a giant
squid in the ocean depths
was filmed, a fleeting
glimpse of graceful tenta-
cles snatching at a lure.
Science has added
a few more titillating
facts to our knowledge
of the giant squid than
just photographic
evidence; we know that
it has three hearts, a blue,
copper-based blood, a
doughnut-shaped brain,
the largest eyes of any
living animal, and a jet
propulsion system that
can propel itself forwards
and backwards. But, fun-
damental questions still
remain.
The giant squid has
“many complex and
elaborate features”, as
Dr Albertin, the MBL
member of the team, puts
it, but “they are thought
to have evolved inde-
pendently of vertebrates.”
So, the Copenhagen Uni-
versity-led team hoped
that its genome could
provide some answers;
it would be the biggest
advance in genetic infor-
mation on the giant squid
since it was discovered
in 2013 that all giant
squids (from those that
roam the polar seas to
those inhabiting tropical
oceans) belong to the
same species.
There was only one
problem – fresh DNA
samples from a species
that spends its time in the
deepest, darkest depths
are not easy to come by.
So, instead, the team had
to use tissue samples from
dead specimens, which
can lower the integrity of
the available DNA and
lead to an incomplete
dataset. To combat this,
the team also isolated
the proteins in the tissue
sample, so that by working
forwards from the DNA
and backwards from the
end-product proteins, the
holes in the dataset were
easier to patch up.
As a result, we can
now add to our small
repository of giant squid
stats that these creatures
have a genome around
90% the size of ours; 2.7
billion DNA base pairs
against our 3 billion, and
consisting of 33,406 pro-
tein-coding genes.
It was within these
coding sequences that the
first answers were found.
The giant squid’s brain,
that doughnut shaped ring
far more sophisticated
than those other inverte-
brates possess, may now
make more evolutionary
sense following the
team’s discovery of 135
protocadherin genes in its
genome.
“Protocadherins are
thought to be important
in wiring up a compli-
cated brain correctly,” Dr
Albertin says. “They were
thought to be a vertebrate
innovation, so we were
really surprised when
we found more than 100
of them in the octopus
genome, in 2015. That
seemed like a smoking
gun to how you make a
complicated brain. And
we have found a similar
expansion of protocadher-
ins in the giant squid, as
well.”
And the brain is not
the only rarity bordering
on the impossible when it
comes to the giant squid.
Thought to be relative-
ly short-lived with just
a five-year lifespan, the
creature is not only big,
but must grow rapidly to
achieve its infamous size.
By analysing certain DNA
sequences responsible for
development and growth
that are well-conserved
across animal life, clues
about this speedy growth
spurt were hoped to be un-
covered. Intriguingly, the
team were able to discount
one possibility of how the
creature got its name – the
evidence showed that the
giant squid has only one
copy of these important
sequences, the Wnt and
Hox genes, which ruled
out whole genome dupli-
cation. Whole genome
duplication is a method
which increases genome
complexity through du-
plicating it in its entirety.
Spare copies allow for
mutations and therefore
spur on substantial evolu-
tionary changes – such as
a dramatic growth pattern.

“The giant
squid is hardly
much more
understood
today than
in those first,
early days of
discovery in
the 1800s”
The genome did,
however, have a high
proportion of transpos-
able elements – sections
of genetic code that are
able to move within the
genome, introducing
instability and therefore
another major contributor
to evolutionary change.
By analysing the extent
of genetic change in
the transposed gene
compared to its starting
sequence, the team found
suggestions of a recent
burst of activity in these
elements, comparative
to related squid species.
But to connect this
activity directly to the
giant squid’s size requires
further unpicking.
So, is the giant squid
a mystery no more? Has
the enigma of the Kraken
been cracked? Although
the genome sequence and
protein library begin to
fill in the blanks, it seems
there is still plenty left to
catch our curiosity – and
our imagination.
