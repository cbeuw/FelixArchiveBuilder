hard to keep enthusiastic,”
Professor Tim Horbury,
principal investigator for
the magnetometer, told
Felix. “Of the places in
the UK that build space
hardware, we are by far
the smallest. There is an
issue about making sure
we keep right expertise in
the room.”
“It’s very easy to get
80% of the way there, but
it’s very difficult to get the
final 20%, and that has
been the case all the way
through,” added Senior
Instrument Manager, Ms.
Helen O’Brien. Both Tim
and Helen are travelling
to Florida for the launch,
where they will be in the
company of around two
thousand scientists and
engineers, each anxiously
standing by to provide
urgent assistance if any
problems arise. However,
once the rocket has safely
left the ground the celebra-
tions will begin. “There
will be multiple parties…
it’ll be like the Oscars –
whose post-launch party
do you go to?”
As well as staff, many
Imperial students have
worked on Solar Orbiter
throughout the course
of its development.
One such student was
Maxsim Pudney who first
became involved in space
instrumentation through
a UROP during his
second year as a physics
undergraduate. Following
this, he completed work
experience at Airbus (then
Astrium), and later a PhD
joint between Imperial and
Airbus. His project, com-
pleted in 2014, concerned
Solar Orbiter’s ‘magnetic
cleanliness’ – how the
magnetic fields generated
by the spacecraft can
affect the extremely
sensitive magnetometers.
Since completing his
PhD, he has continued to
work on Solar Orbiter at
Airbus and will also be
on the ground in Cape
Canaveral. Speaking to
Felix, he said “after the
launch, I am looking
forward to continuing
my work on the mission
with some assessment and
modelling of the in-flight
data, which will mean
from the start of my PhD
in 2010 to finish in 2020
I will have worked on the
mission for 10 years!”
One of the first instru-
ments to be turned on
once in space, the mag-
netometer is expected to
return its first data within
a few days. The launch
will be live streamed on
YouTube by NASA, and
updates posted on Twitter
by Professor Horbury @
SolarOrbiterMAG.
Felix will publish a
follow-up, technical-fo-
cused article on the Solar
Orbiter and the MAG in
the Science section in the
coming weeks.
