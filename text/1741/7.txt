the way we go about it

T
hanks to scien-
tific thought,
today’s world
is one of ration-
ality and unprecedented
material comfort, with-
out which I probably
wouldn’t be sat in the
warm writing this arti-
cle. The path of history
since the dawn of the
scientific method has
been marked by both an
intense development of
our productivity and a
general trend towards
greater secularism, the
former of which has
culminated in our fa-
miliar global capitalism.
This development has
provided benefits far
beyond those already
mentioned, but it has
also led to some terrible
events and hitherto
unimaginable levels of
exploitation. Here, I’m
not going to talk about
any of that. Instead, I’m
interested in how all
this plays with our most
fundamental desire:
meaning.
If there’s one charac-
teristic which unites all
humans, it’s an implicit
acknowledgement of the
absurdity of their condi-
tion. It confronts us every
time we stare at the stars
and feel powerless; it rears
its head whenever we
contemplate life beyond
our subjectivity. We can’t
live like this, of course,
and so we’ve always
managed to ﬁnd ways to
comfort ourselves. The
most obvious of these is
spirituality, which has
often manifested itself as
some form of religion.
The belief in something
greater than man, which
ought to be intrinsically
unknowable, is powerful:
when we accept a limit to
the agency we can a priori
exert over nature, we
psychologically relieve
ourselves of precisely this
limitation. What’s more,
this acceptance comes
with free meaning, since
nature, the predicate for
this belief starts to fall
away.
As science comes to the
fore in history and a more
secular society begins to
emerge, we come to un-
derstand more about the
world, so the need to ﬁll
the gaps with such thought
seems to diminish. But, as
you may have guessed,
I’m not sure that this
is the case. Sure, our
objective knowledge is at
an all-time high, but the
more we learn, the more
complex and unknow-
able the world appears
to become. Capitalism
moves in tandem with
science, and along with
the wealth it generates
come odd new phenom-
ena. The commodiﬁed
form of social relations
estranges us from our-
selves; our connection
to our products seems
increasingly tenuous. In
short, objectivity is not
enough. We need to ﬁnd
room for transcendence
somewhere in all this, and
interestingly capitalism
itself has provided an
answer. Through the very
same mechanisms which
alienate products from
labour, commodities
take on meaning beyond
themselves via their social
position in the market.
In essence, commodities
come with transcendence
for free, and so our desire
for meaning translates into
a lust for consumption.
If seeking the
transcendent is one way
out of an existential crisis,
then another can be found
in ourselves. Living in
communities where we
understand our position
and relationships can give
us the tangible comfort of
belonging. I feel most at
ease when I understand
myself as part of a whole,
and not in isolation –
perhaps I would have
made a poor Romantic
hero. In pre-industrial
the answer is not clear in
general, nor is it uniform.
Either way, our method
for ﬁnding comfort in
our communities has to
change as those commu-
nities do. For the moment,
history is moving faster
than philosophy.
Where does all this
leave us? It would seem
that the development of
science and capitalism has
today left us in a curious
existential position. It has
simultaneously secular-
ised and objectiﬁed life
itself by attempting to
replace divine transcend-
ence with the joy of an
Apple product. It has also
fundamentally changed
the way that our commu-
nities operate, forcing us
to rethink how we live and
feel together.These effects
aren’t disjoint either, and
their interactions become
more intricate by the day.
Given this, society has a
question to answer: are we
OK with this? Seemingly,
many people say no.
The recent resurgence of
reactionary conservatism
and populism could be
understood as a reaction
to the theft of meaning.
Maybe none of this
really matters. After all,
what is the real differ-
ence between an effigy
and an iPhone? And
how can we know how
our communities will
continue to evolve under
the present conditions?
But I think that the wave
of reaction we see today
can, at least in part, be
understood as part of a
historical shift in how
we find meaning in the
world. If that’s the case,
then we owe it to our-
selves to find it better.

society, life was domi-
nated by the local, and as
such it could be intuitively
understood. Today’s
world interacts with the
old idea of the community
in a subtle way, but I’d
argue that there are two
main things which shape
it the most. On the one
hand we have the Internet,
which creates opportuni-
ties for totally new kinds
of community, no longer
separated by space. On
the other we have globali-
sation, which has shrunk
the world market-wise
and people-wise, allowing
for greater contact - and
exploitation – between
people than ever before.
In both of these cases,
people become acutely
aware of their relative
size in this new global
community, and this
leaves them with two
inevitable questions. How
do I ﬁt in here? How can I
continue to feel meaning-
ful agency? How indeed:
if we can have faith in
something transcendent
then we absolve ourselves
of the responsibility. But

limitations and come to
exert greater agency over
