oday (the day
of publication)
Britain will leave
the European
Union. By and large this
will be marked not with
spitﬁre displays and ring-
ing of Big Ben but with
a restrained hour long
countdown projected onto
Downing Street and the
issue of a commemorative
50p coin. These are not
the sort of festivities that
are typically brought
out when large events
occur. Remembering
the enormous show of
affection and celebration
that greeted the wedding
of Harry and Megan, two
royals that would never
ascend the throne, it is as-
tonishing that the leaving
of the EU, an event with
far greater signiﬁcance,
would not be marked in
some way. This reﬂects
the government and
many people’s attitude
that the last 4 years have
been an embarrassing
display for a nation that
considers itself a cradle
of democracy. That many
foreign publications refer
to our Prime Minister as a
‘Mini Trump’ is yet more
evidence of how far we
have fallen.
People that didn’t
realise that today was
the day need not panic.
We shouldn’t notice any
great changes as Britain
must remain regulatorar-
ily aligned with the EU
until the end of the year
as part of a transition
period during which the
future relationship must
be worked out.
The challenges that
face us now, however,
dwarf those that filled
meters of print columns
while we as nation con-
vulsed, trying to come to
an agreement over what
all those crosses next to
the Leave box meant.
First and foremost,
we must look to the
state of our Union. The
United Kingdom is not a
single nation but rather
a collection of four
constituent nations all
governed by the gov-
ernment of their shared
monarch. The ties that
bind these nations
together, however, are
looking more precari-
ous than they have in
centuries. The Scottish
Nationalists have mo-
nopolised the country’s
Westminster MPs and
should they similarly
carry the vote in national
elections to Holyrood,
their devolved legis-
lature, Johnson will
find it difficult to deny
Nicola Sturgeon her
desired Indyref2, a
second referendum on
Scottish independence.
Similarly, the December
election was significant
in how Northern Irish
constituencies changed
hands. Rather than
being dominated by
the two extreme voices
of Unionism and Na-
tionalism, other parties
managed to break
through and gained
seats. However, this
marked the first election
where Nationalist parties
(pro unification with the
Republic of Ireland)
outnumbered Unionist
ones (pro remaining part
of the United Kingdom).
The end of freedom of
movement also has the
potential to open old
wounds from the days
of the Troubles. Many
people do not understand
the huge place that those
years of terror have in
the minds of people from
Northern Ireland and I
would recommend the
BBC series Spotlight on
the Troubles to anyone
seeking to inform them-
selves about this vital
but overlooked part of
our nation’s history. The
long held belief in these
regions that Westmin-
ster cares only for the
concerns of England has
only been strengthened
by the Brexit result
and the Conservatives
should not just consider
the concerns of the
Northern constituencies
that ‘lent’ votes to the
Tories, a clear example
of factionalism and pork
barrel politics, but the
whole country that they
claim to represent.
Secondly, the issue
of social care must be
addressed. Successive
governments have
kicked the issue down
the road and the only
attempt to do so serious-
ly by the May adminis-
tration was destroyed
by the moniker of the
‘Dementia tax’. We as a
nation must confront the
looming burden that our
increasing life expec-
tancy and demographics
threaten us with. It has
been predicted that fol-
lowing current trends, 1
in 3 people born this year
will suffer from some
sort of dementia. In 5
years there are predicted
to be 150,000 more
sufferers and 1,150,000
more by 2050. Unless
we as a nation confront
this, it will be a black
hole in the health budget
that could bring down
the valuable institution
of the NHS. The Prime
Minister has been
making the right noises,
recently claiming that
initiatives could begin as
early as March, but his
insistence that people
will not have to sell
their homes to pay for
care threatens to make
any policy implemented
window dressing on the
worsening crisis.
Finally, the govern-
ment should address
political apathy. If, as
a nation, we cannot
convince the youth
of the value of our
democratic system then
the ideology that we
preach deserves to fail.
School students should
be taught how both our
political and economic
systems work. In
1996, New York Times
columnist Thomas
Friedman wrote: ‘You
could almost say that we
live again in a two-su-
perpower world. There
is the US and there is
Moody’s. The US can
destroy a country by
leveling it with bombs;
Moody’s can destroy a
country by downgrading
its bonds.’ Many readers
will struggle to say what
Moody’s is. There are
incredibly powerful
forces that define how
we live our lives that we
have little to no knowl-
edge of.
Today represents the
first step of a healing
process that we must
walk together to do right
for the people of the
nation.
