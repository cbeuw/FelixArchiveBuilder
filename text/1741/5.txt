Should the UK allow Huawei to build our 5G
infrastructure?
Comment writer Andy Wang argues that giving Huawei a role in our telecoms infrastructure is
not simple a question of national security but also a moral one

Boris Johnson
approved the
use of Huawei
equipment in “non-core”
parts of UK’s brand new
5G infrastructure, on the
advice from British se-
curity services that “all
risks are manageable”.
This makes the UK one
of two Five-Eye coun-
tries which didn’t issue a
blanket ban on Huawei’s
involvement in network
infrastructure; it also
aligned the UK with
many EU countries, like
France and Germany,
who welcomed technical
involvement from the
Chinese telecommuni-
cation giant.
This decision came
after intense lobbying by
the US, urging the UK to
ban Huawei from having
a role in the development
of its next generation 5G
telecoms network . Trump
used several different
official channels to try
to convince or threaten
British officials to drop
their plan of opening the
doors to Huawei. Unlike
American counterparts,
UK security agencies
have long been cautiously
optimistic about Huawei’s
involvement in the UK’s
communication backbone.
GCHQ, the British
signals and communica-
tions monitoring agency
has audited Huawei’s
products over the last
several years. Reading
their published annual
report from 2019, one
would think that Huawei
is simultaneously Su-
pervillain number one
who epitomises the art
of covert surveillance
and utterly incompetent
without the competency
to hide any backdoor at
all. The report lambasted
Huawei’s code quality and
questioned their “basic
engineering competence”.
In a single version of
Huawei’s firmware, the
auditors discovered 70
duplicate copies of 4
different versions of the
same dependency library
critical for cryptographic
operations, OpenSSL,
with the oldest one orig-
inally written 20 years
ago. In any case, GCHQ
provided “limited assur-
ance” that Huawei does
Huawei’s 5G network
devices aren’t capable of
snooping on the content
of private communica-
tions over the internet.
Ironically, all three past
Home Secretaries have
expressed a desire to ban
end-to-end encryption
because it “protects
terrorists” – displaying a
shocking lack of cyberse-
curity knowledge.
So, it’s all well and
good and we can all
enjoy the world’s most
advanced 5G technology
right? Absolutely not.
Disappointingly, the
spirited debate on Huawei
has focused almost ex-
clusively on the national
security aspect, with
ethical considerations
tossed aside. When Face-
book’s dodgy business
with Cambridge Analyt-
ica was exposed, Mark
Zuckerberg became the
pariah of the Internet and
people were vocal about
boycotting Facebook
(how many actually did,
of course, was a different
story). While Huawei’s
ethical deficit far exceeds
what Facebook could
ever have done, they have
largely dodged the public
spotlight.
Several years ago,
Cisco came under fire for
providing network devices
to a Chinese censorship
programme. Now the
Chinese government has
sought cooperation from
Huawei and the capability
of the Great Firewall has
increased rapidly over the
last few years. It is now
by far the world’s most
sophisticated censorship
and mass surveillance
programme, monitoring
all outbound internet
traffic in real-time. As in-
dicated in leaked Xinjiang
documents obtained by
International Consortium
for International Journal-
ists (ICIJ), visiting too
many foreign websites is
a sufficient transgression
against the regime to be
thrown into a re-education
camp.
Much like the Metro-
politan Police recently,
Huawei is also quite
enthusiastic about the
use of automated facial
recognition. Huawei is a
major provider both of the
technology itself and the
supporting network equip-
ment for AFR cameras,
which has been deployed
across China. One of the
possible uses for Huawei
products advertised on
their website is tracking
people’s movements
across multiple cameras
in real-time, obtaining
the subject’s identity and
exactly where the person
has been at precisely what
time. With Huawei’s help,
the Chinese dystopian
reality may soon render
Charlie Brooker’s Black
Mirror fantasy into
mundane thriller.
More broadly, Huawei
is just one of many pawns
that willingly facilitated
China’s moral race to the
bottom since Xi’s rise to
power. While perhaps at-
titudes towards China are
still positive relative to the
international treatment of
apartheid-era SouthAfrica
that experienced sports
boycotts, Olympics expul-
sion and disinvestments,
the CCP has gotten away
with its behaviours too
easily. Huawei’s success
at gaining a foothold in
the UK market is yet more
material to be used by the
CCP in the whitewashing
and moral laundering of
its way of governance.
The British response
should be an alarm bell,
a loud and clear call that
we are not fine with those
who rub shoulders with
repressive regimes.
Code can be audited,
vulnerability can
be fixed, backdoors
can be discovered,
and hardware can be
replaced; but you can’t
patch a moral vacuum.
The profit Huawei will
make from the UK
market will come out of
the pockets of ordinary
Brits, and much of it
will be invested into
surveillance, censorship
and suppression. Cheap
and fast 5G, as won-
derful as it is, cannot
justify the position
we find ourselves in. I
hope very much I’ll be
proven wrong, but the
government’s decision
may well be one we’ll
all come to regret.

“Huawei is
just one of
many pawns
that willingly
facillitated
China’s moral
race to the
bottom since
Xi’s rise”
not pose a serious security
threat.
Given the fact that
Huawei’s software is full
of vulnerable code, and
that China is an “adver-
sarial state actor”, it is
difficult to ask the public
to trust Huawei with their
private information. The
good news is: we don’t
need to. Thanks to end-
to-end encryption based
on open standards, open
source implementations
and open collaborations,
