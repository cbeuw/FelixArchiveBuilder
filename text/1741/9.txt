India’s economic
potential
Despite the horrors of
British colonialism, India
did gain a few advantages
because of this. Firstly,
it is the world’s largest
democracy. Secondly, it
is the second largest Eng-
lish-speaking nation in
the world after the United
States. With English being
the primary language of
international business,
this is very advantageous.
Additionally, India was
left with a British style
legal system, despite the
presence of corruption.
Overall, on paper, the
Indian legal system can be
seen as very similar to that
of a western democracy.
This means that the core
legal framework of the
Indian judicial system is
fair. This is something
that is very attractive to a
company when deciding
whether to set up oper-
ations in a country. It
can also be seen in the
WJP Open Government
Index where India ranks
37th
globally whereas
its primary competitor,
China, ranks at 87th
world-
wide. In addition to this
therearestrictlawsagainst
intellectual property
theft, which encourages
business conﬁdence when
deciding to start business
in a new country. Also,
due to more extreme
protectionist policies
and abrupt actions by
the Chinese government,
many businesses have
looked for other locations
to relocate their manufac-
turing hubs. For example,
Samsung has moved all of
its smartphone production
from China to India and
Vietnam, and Apple has
also begun manufacturing
phones in India. India has
the potential to become a
global manufacturing hub
for low- and medium-
end mass-produced
products because of its
large young population.
Limitations to India
achieving its
economic potential
Though India may have
great potential, there are
many limitations that can
hinder Indian growth.
Since the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP), led
by Narendra Modi, took
power in 2014 thanks to
promises that India would
become a global power-
house, Modi has been a
polarising ﬁgure. He has
had some successes such
as increasing the ease with
which companies can
operate within the country.
India rose in the ease of
doing business index from
132nd
when he took power
to 63rd
globally. Many of
the country’s bureaucratic
policies and red tape
regulations were also
removed. In addition to
this, since he took power
more Indians have begun
to use bank accounts and
cashless payments, which
has lowered corruption
in welfare payments as
citizens are directly paid
without possibility of
corrupt ofﬁcials retaining
owed cash. However,
despite these smaller suc-
cesses, many large social
and economic issues have
arisen during Modi’s
premiership. The largest
mistake being the 2016
demonetisation crisis.
Failed economic
policies
In 2016, in a sudden
surprise move to destroy
the shadow economy
and the amount of “black
money” in the country,
Modi’s government an-
nounced that all 500 and
1000 rupee notes would
be rendered worthless and
thatallcitizenswouldhave
to go to banks to exchange
these notes for new 500
and 2000 rupee notes.
While the move had good
intentions to catch those
who had black money, the
policy was a huge failure,
with cash shortages being
present throughout the
country and businesses
not being able to run due
to this liquidity crisis.
Thus, the effort to curtail
the shadow economy also
failed as over 99% of the
old notes were submitted,
which suggests that those
handling illegal money
managed to convert it
into the new notes. Due
to this move, the Indian
economy slowed down by
several percentage points
and many jobs were lost.
Another major failure
was the introduction of a
tax on foreign investors
that would see them
being taxed 40% to do
business in India, despite
India having one of the
highest import tariffs in
the world among major
economies. This heavily
backﬁred and caused the
worst Indian stock market
performance in 17 years.
The tax was retracted
from law within a month
because of the potential
loss in foreign investment
that could occur. Further-
more, a General Sales
Tax was introduced to
make all the states within
India essentially a single
market and allowing in-
terstate trade to be easier.
However, as with demon-
etisation, this policy was
heavily criticised for the
method via which it was
implemented. Because of
this tax, many small busi-
nesses shut down or were
put into ﬁnancial difﬁcul-
ties. Despite these huge
blunders by the Indian
Government, Modi’s BJP
won a landslide general
election in 2019 – primar-
ily attributed to a weak
opposition and a huge
misinformation propagan-
da campaign carried out
by “IT cells”, indirectly
controlled by the BJP’s
Public Relations arm.
Divisive social
policies
Since Modi’s election,
sectarian violence has
been on the rise and ex-
tremist Hindu nationalism
has also risen. This can be
seen by the lynching of
Muslims for consuming
beef – a sacred animal
in Hinduism – in the
northern Hindi belt states.
Other radical policies
occurring because of
Modi’s government is the
nearly 6-month internet
shutdown in the union
territories of Ladakh
and Jammu & Kashmir
because of anti-govern-
ment protests. More social
unrest has occurred with
protests across India due
to the introduction of the
Citizenship Amendment
Act (CAA), which is a
law introduced by the BJP
that allows non-Muslim
refugees from neighbour-
ing countries in Asia to
be given refuge and an
express pathway to citi-
zenship in India. However,
many believed this to be
against the Indian consti-
tution, which implies that
India is a secular country
with freedom of religion.
Thus, this act violated the
