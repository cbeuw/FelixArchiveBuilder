There is a Certain Je ne sais Quoi about Uncle Monty...
C
l a p h a m ,
Thursday night.
A cool breeze
sweeps me along
as Battersea Power Station
glitters in the distance.
From outside The Bread
and Roses pub sticks out
like a sore thumb in its
location set back from a
lonely residential street.
I step inside quickly. I’m
instantly blasted back by
soaring sounds emerging
from the stage to my right
and as I scuttle away, I re-
alise it’s them. It’s Uncle
Monty.
As the noise dies down,
I crave for more and with
my second realisation
since stepping inside, I
notice they are still sound
checking. Thankfully, I
haven’t missed a thing.
A few technical hiccups
later and this time the
band are on for good.
Singer/guitarist Harvey
Montague launches into ‘I
Fucking H8 U (But I Need
Your Love)’, somehow
crooning and spitting out
the lyrics to convey a love-
filled rage with a twinge
of hurt. It’s straight-up
indie, with subtle folk
and jazz undertones and
maybe even a hint of The
Beatles in guitarist Yanis
Mzari’s solo towards
the end. This oozes into
the next song, ‘Stan the
Man’, where Felix’s own
Miles Gulliford mimics
the rhythm in the title
with his infectious bass
line which creeps its way
into this dreamy indie-pop
song. Drummer Amber
Dylan is the star of this
song though, providing a
great beat even as Uncle
Monty slip into their
next song ‘Off with Their
Heads’. Montague guides
us through his climactic
chorus with an acoustic
riff Johnny Cash would be
jealous of, whilst the rest
of the band groove along
in sync.
Up next is the bluesy
‘King of Everything’
followed by ‘Poplar
Tree’, a melancholic
indie-pop hit which show-
cases Montague’s lyrical
abilities: “If it were up
to me//I’d suffocate and
masturbate”. ‘Poplar Tree’
also hinted at a slinky,
bluesy pop noise while in-
corporating a singer-song-
writer element, with this
all eventually reaching a
crescendo complete with
swooning guitar from
Mzari, crashing drums
and a bassline that held it
all together, with the result
taking your breath away.
Uncle Monty followed
this up with ‘I Took a
Pill’, where Montague,
sounding like Dan
Auerbach of The Black
Keys, softly lulled us in
before Dylan crashed us
back down to the ground
with a hard-hitting chorus
not unlike the in-your-face
style of The Smashing
Pumpkins. Rounding the
set off came ‘Bulldog
Puppy Love’, reminiscent
of Pete and the Pirates
and accompanied by a
catchy chorus that stayed
with me long after I left
Clapham behind. My
final thoughts, as the bus
whisked me away, were
those of advice: if you’re
anywhere near South
London, you should defi-
nitely keep an eye out for
Uncle Monty.

Music Editor
beat compilations are so
uniform in texture and
style that it essentially
boils down to being
elevator music; its sole
purpose is to fill a void
and not be noticed. At
least in context elevator
music makes sense: you
only listen to it for a
brief period of time and it
makes what can be an un-
comfortable space a little
more calming. Repetitive
and predictable are not
qualities you should
look for in study music.
Breaking concentration
from your work only to
be greeted by the drowsy,
sedated sounds of lo-fi
beats just leaves you tired
and apathetic. White
noise - literally defined as
lacking pattern or rhythm
- is more engaging, and
as an added bonus it has
anti-anxiety effects. I’d
much rather listen to
Sounds of Nature Relaxa-
tion for hours on end (real
artist on Spotify, highly
recommend).
There are so many new
and genuinely interesting
things to listen to out
there, but with lo-fi beats
it’s the same goddamn
thing every time. When
was the last time you heard
someone raving about a
Lo-Fi artist? 99.9% of
you just answered “never”
because nobody can even
name more than one.
When I sit down to study
there are a myriad of
different worlds I can end
up inhabiting. From the
desert landscapes painted
by psychedelic funk to
the neon-lit utopias of
synth wave, my childhood
dreamworlds of studio
Ghibli soundtracks to
the infectious beats of
alternative electronic.
Yes, I’m aware I sound
like a pretentious dick de-
scribing the music I study
to like this, but I only do
it because I have genuine
affection for it.
I suppose the crux
of my hatred for lo-fi
beats is that every piece
of recorded music in all
of history only a click
away, so then why would
I choose to listen to the
most tedious, banal, and
uninspired music of our
generation?
Most people I know
thankfully choose not to
If lo-fi beats are so good then why does she always look bored? // jpmachado.art
poison their brains with
lo-fi beats. Hopefully
neither do you. If you do,
and anything that I’ve said
has inspired you to try
someting different, then
let me throw a few recom-
mendations your way to
get you started: Bonobo
- Migration, Krhuangbin
- The Universe Smiles
Upon You, and Ross From
Friends - You’ll Under-
stand.
Who knows, this might
even make you smarter.
