Nationalist paradise?

E
conomists from
all over the world
have consist-
ently predicted
that India will become
the world’s largest or
second largest economy.
However, its economic
growth rate is slowing,
and social unrest is rising.
This article serves to
explain and analyse
the history of India, its
economic potential and
issues that hinder it from
achieving the status of an
economic superpower.
History,
British colonialism,
and independence
For the majority of the
period between the 1st
and
18th
centuries, the Indian
subcontinent possessed
the largest economy in the
world, only trading places
with China, which was of
a similar size. However,
during the arrival and
occupation of India by
the British Empire, the
Indian economy stalled
and became very insignif-
icant on the global stage.
Once India achieved its
independence from the
United Kingdom in 1947,
the newly founded Indian
Government followed a
protectionist economic
regime. The reasoning
for this was that India
had suffered the horrors
of colonialism such as
slavery and famine, so
it did not wish to subject
any other nation to what
it had experienced. It
had minimal trade with
other nations, national-
ised its main industries,
Politics writer Nehaal Pillai summarises the events that have led to India’s current economic turbulence.

and set out its economic
plans every 5 years – a
method of governance
often associated with
communism. The country
also introduced soviet-in-
spired laws, with its main
partner throughout much
of the 20th
century being
the Soviet Union. Such
laws included the License
Raj, a large system of
licences and regulation
which were required to
be followed to set up and
Post-colonialism
In the latter half of the
20th
century, the Indian
economy grew at a slow
pace similar to other
communist countries with
a primarily agricultural
economy. However, in
1991, the year the Soviet
Union collapsed, India
lost its largest ally and
trading partner. 1991 was
the year in which India
experienced its slowest
economic growth since
to this growth, hundreds
of millions of people
have been taken out of
poverty. Just between
2006 and 2016, over 271
million people came out
of poverty. Moreover,
cities in India began to
experience a massive in-
frastructure boom due to
increased economic pros-
perity. The south Indian
city of Bangalore became
the India’s IT capital and
the global centre of out-
sourcing, Mumbai, India’s
largest city, is now one of
the top 15 wealthiest cities
in the world (despite high
income inequality) and is
in the top 3 cities with the
highest rate of skyscrapers
being built. Most major
cities improved infrastruc-
ture by the construction
of modern transportation
systems, i.e. metro rail
systems. Trade with other
countries also improved,
with high levels of foreign
investment entering the
country and defence deals
being signed with other
powers such as the United
States and Russia.
run a business, which
essentially functioned as
a bureaucratic binding of
red tape.Although follow-
ing the style of communist
nations, however, India
was not a communist
state. For example, it
supported free markets
outside of its core nation-
alised industries. This is
essentially a mix of the
worst of capitalism and
the worst of communism.
independence. In addition
to this and other external
factors such as rising oil
prices, India was very
close to defaulting on its
debt. Thus, the Indian
Government turned to the
International Monetary
Fund (IMF) for a bailout
loan. The IMF agreed
to grant a $1.8 billion
loan on the conditions
that India would open to
international trade and
deregulate its economy.
In response, India
relaxed its strict trade
policies, privatised its
inefﬁcient industries and
decommissioned the
License Raj, allowing for
much more ease in starting
and running businesses.
Hereon India could be
classed as a primarily
capitalist nation with
free markets. Following
this, the Indian economy
skyrocketed, effectively
doubling its GDP every
5 years – an economic
miracle for a large
country only seen before
in previous decades by
Japan and China. Thanks
