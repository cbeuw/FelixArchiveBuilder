f Union staff mem-
bers expected to
be carried through
Beit courtyard on
students’ shoulders in
thanks for reopening the
568 kitchens they were
disappointed this week
as the event was met
with a muted response.
Student numbers were
low and those that did
come in mainly drank.
The kitchen staff were
sent home early and
the full fridges and
freezers barely had to be
restocked.
Deputy President
(FInance and Services)
Bibi Harry confronted one
of the boozing students
and insisted to know why
he wasn’t stuffing his face
full of curly fries after she
had done so much to get
them back. The student
admitted that since the
kitchens had closed he had
had to teach himself how
to cook and now realised
what an unhealthy menu
was on offer.
The content of his
wordswasechoedbyother
students that admitted
that the Union stopping
serving food had actually
been one of the best things
that had ever happened
to them. “You know you
can buy a whole bag of
exactly the same curly
fries from super markets?”
whispered one student
who refused to give his
name but was wearing a
Medics rugby jumper. “I
bought mozzarella as well
and it didn’t cost me £5
pounds extra! Obviously
I had to work out how
the oven worked at home
first but once I stuck the
whole thing one of those
oval plates I stole from the
Union it was even better
than being there!” His
flatmates corroborated
the story. “Yesterday he
asked one of us to teach
him how to make a salad?
We are taking him to the
doctor tomorrow”
I left the oven on! // Wikimedia
