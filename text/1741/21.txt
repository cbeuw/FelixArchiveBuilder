heard of
him or not,
he is undoubtedly a cult
figurehead personifying
our generation’s anxiety
and depression. Going
by several monikers and
aliases, by far his most
influential and prolific
personality is that of King
Krule.
Archy Ivan Marshall.
He grew up in Southwark,
moving between Peckham
and East Dulwich, and
despite struggles with
mental health during his
childhood he has been
moulded into a young man
with seemingly endless
creativity and potential.
When digging into this
illusive figure’s history
you could be forgiven in
thinking all the different
names where those of
individual musicians
– but mistaken. Albeit
slightly unorthodox
names – examples include
The Return of the Pimp
Shrimp, Zoo Kid, DJ JD
Sports, and variations
of Edgar the Beatmak-
er – each one has its
own unique sound with
uncompromising depth.
These monikers have their
own fascinating origins
and give you a brief
glimpse into the mind of
a prodigy. For example,
King Krule was formulat-
ed on Elvis Presley’s film
‘King Creole’. Notable
similarities between the
two is that both Danny
Fisher (Elvis) and Archy
dropped out of school and
possess musical talent.
The story of ‘King Creole’
is also intertwined with
the immature romance
between Danny and
Nellie which eventually
blossoms at the end of
the film; the same theme
is littered throughout
Archy’s music, that of dis-
appointment and regret.
“Marshall
has a knack
for plucking
heart strings,
drenching his
works with
emotion such
that it seeps
from the
edges”
Around 2010, Archy
started producing music
as Zoo Kid with his long-
time friend and fellow
Brit School student Jamie
Isaac. But in 2013, King
Krule reared his head with
6 Feet Beneath the Moon
– a critically acclaimed
debut album which turned
heads and drew ears. This
was and still is my older
brother’s favourite album
of all time.
Depression is a topic
that Archy covers often,
perhaps related to his
childhood mental health
problems, discussed in
an interview with The
Guardian in 2013. For
those who similarly strug-
gled with anxiety, their
emotions, and identity
the music of King Krule
provided a sympathetic
touch.
Marshall has a knack
for plucking heart strings,
drenching his works
with emotion such that
it seeps from the edges.
His music is not bound by
genre instead drawing on
the best aspects of each,
however rock (“Alterna-
tive” as stated by iTunes)
would always be his
most intimate stage. This
originality is exemplified
in Archy’s 2015 A New
Place 2 Drown which was
part of a larger project
with his brother, Jack. The
project included a vivid
and touching mini doc-
umentary of their lives,
friends, and mother. It
gave his audience a chance
to see the real King Krule.
Going back to the music,
this album was much
darker and more sinister
than previous works
possibly mirroring how
Archy felt during the time.
Chasing a slightly digital
feel, he made most of the
album using a simple beat
looper and a laptop. Not to
detract from the music, it
was unique, one of a kind,
veering from the trodden
path and venturing into an
unknown which he pulled
off perfectly. This was and
still is my favourite album
of all time although this
podium has been peril-
ously close to changing
hands; I still listen to the
entire album from start to
one of his most polished
and deeply moving LPs
to date. Pitchfork named
it the best rock album of
2017. If you don’t know
what album I’m talking
about then you’ve been
living under a rock. The
Ooz is in my top 5 albums
of all time and rightly so.
17 tracks, each crafted
with meticulous care,
with a different narrative,
with the same message:
vexed. In an interview
shortly before releasing
his second album under
King Krule, he talked
about “… the gunk” and
how it was invading his
subconscious, leeching
his creativity, but ended
up giving him the inspira-
tion for the album.
A short biography
of this remarkable gin-
ger-haired man would
not be complete without
mentioning his rela-
tionship with Charlotte
Patmore – photographer,
famous in her own right.
They welcomed their first
baby, Marina, on the 14th
March 2019. Since then,
this power couple have
been busy; raising a child
and directing/filming
would not have been easy
yet they made it happen. I
can’t wait to see what they
do next.
Man Alive! This is my
official endorsement of
an album that only has
one song released so far.
2020 is going to be a big
year for Archy with his
third full-length studio
album set to release on
the 21st February. If
I’m being honest with
myself, I expected an
album after he released
the not-so cryptic ‘Hey
World!’ video (directed
by Charlotte Patmore),
containing 4 new songs
and 2020 tour dates. This
monologuing video pre-
miered the song “(Don’t
Let the Dragon) Draag
On” which is available
at the time of writing by
pre-ordering the album.
Self-directed music video
accompanied, this new
track is twisted in visuals
and lyrics, showing Archy
being burnt alive in the
closing seconds. Man
Alive! is set to be an ode
to melancholy.
