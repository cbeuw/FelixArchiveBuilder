Veganism has been having its time in the spotlight for the past few years, sparking quite a bit of controversy (and

“‘Veganuary’
implies that
a plant-
based diet is
something
casually taken
up once a year,

the consistent

“Are
companies
genuinely
embracing
veganism’s
long-term
vision, or are
they merely
capitalising
on yet another
ephemeral
trend?”

anuary is the time
when every vegan
rejoices: more
plant-based options
at more restaurants! You
have probably seen the
ads and all those trend-
ing #Veganuary laden
Instagram posts. Perhaps
you are a participant
yourself. Since 2014, the
Veganuary charity has
been working with en-
terprises and individuals
to achieve their goal of a
“vegan world”. No sur-
prise here, their flagship
encourages people to
adopt a plant-based diet
for the whole of January
and then (ideally) for the
restoftheirlives,oratleast
stop them from eating as
many animal-based foods.
As #Veganuary draws to
an end, those who have
participated would stay
vegan, become ‘flexitar-
ian’, try again next year
or abandon veganism
altogether. It makes one
wonder, in the grand
scheme of things, whether
veganism is merely just
another passing trend or
an undisputed, long-term
shift in lifestyles.
The issue could lie
with the name of the
campaign. “Veganuary”
implies that a plant-based
diet is something casually
taken up once a year
rather than the consistent
way of life it champions
for. When paired with a
hashtag, the connotations
of momentariness are
even stronger. (Like, is
anyone still on about
#covfefe or #kyliejen-
nerlipchallenge?) We’ve
seen diet trends peak and
fade as quickly as fashion
trends: low-carb, keto,
Whole30... the list goes
on. But it appears that
none of them has had as
controversial and as loud
of an impact as veganism.
In comparison to those
so-called “fad diets”, for
many the ultimate goal
behind adopting a vegan
diet are its wider social
and ethical implications,
rather than just the deeply
personal chase for the
perfect body weight and
shape. There’s the altruis-
tic ideal that comes along
with veganism: rejecting
animal cruelty, mitigating
climate change, alleviat-
ing resource depletion…
You’ve already heard the
story a thousand times.
Even if you haven’t, feel
free to search up #vegan
on social media and read
the comments.
As of now, perhaps
that’s why veganism
doesn’t seem to be
dwindling any time soon,
especially in the UK.
There’s no need to wait
until January to see its
prominence in everyday
life. A plethora of vegan
food alternatives is avail-
able commercially, from
the ubiquitous plant-based
burgers to the array of
nut and seed milks to the
abundant dairy-free ice
creams. Many restaurants
and coffee shops provide
vegan options on the
regular menu and/or are
more than happy to make
vegetarian dishes vegan
upon request. Several
meat-centric burger joints,
once the average vegan’s
arch-nemesis, now have
permanent menu. There
never seemed to be a
shortage of new vegan
launches the past decade:
Violife’s vast assortment
of plant-based cheeses,
Greggs’ vegan sausage
roll (and this year’s new
steak bake), uber-realistic
THIS Isn’t Bacon and
Chicken… Last year, a
record 23% of all new
food product launches
were completely vegan.
Oh, and the opening of
PlantWorks on campus,
of course. You get the
picture.
But are restaurants and
companies genuinely em-
bracing veganism’s long-
term vision, or are they
merely capitalising on yet
another ephemeral trend,
or are they simply trying to
meet customer demands?
