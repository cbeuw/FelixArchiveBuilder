The Graduate (1967)
W
hat are you
going to do
with your
f u t u r e ? ’
A seemingly harmless
question often posed by
those who mean well,
reverberates in Ben’s
life since graduation.
After leaving college
with an enviable degree,
having been captain of
the cross-country team
and editor of the college
paper, Ben struggles with
the idea of his life fading
into nothing after such
success. Despite being
seemingly adored by his
family and their friends,
Ben is aware that any
interest is temporary until
he makes the next step in
his life. This step he de-
cides, albeit reluctantly, is
to have an affair with Mrs.
Robinson, a family friend.
The arrangement with
Mrs. Robinson seems to
work perfectly until Ben
decides that he has fallen
in love with, and wants
to marry Mrs Robinson’s
daughter, Elaine.
Director Mike Nichols,
recipient of the 1967
academy award for best
director, could have his
success with this film
attributed to his decision
to stray from conventions
of the era and instead look
to the French new wave
for inspiration. What
makes this movie special
is that scenes which could
have been wearisome and
dull are replaced with an
entirely fascinating and
unique vehicle for rep-
resenting the passing of
time, censoring is replaced
with hilarious cuts and a
selection of unconven-
tional cinematography
choices are sprinkled in
unevenly throughout the
first third. By uncon-
ventional choices think
watching Ben from his
point of view, being
forced to plunge into his
family pool while wearing
his brand-new scuba
suit, only to sink to the
bottom to contemplate
what he’s doing with his
life. If trying to place the
Graduate in a category,
offbeat comedies of the
likes of ‘Punch Drunk
Love’ or ‘Breakfast at
Tiffany’s’ are comparable,
where offbeat overshad-
ows most of the comedy.
Looking past the
director, it is also Dustin
Hoffman’s debut perfor-
mance that makes this.
Hoffman manages to
perfectly capture youthful
naivety, rebellion, erratic
decision making and the
feeling of just wanting a
long, long, LONG break.
Ben’s character is almost
like five different people
in one, but he is portrayed
in a manner that makes his
charactermaketotalsense,
and despite his questiona-
ble life choices in his film,
makes Ben a relatable
guy. The real star of this
film is the soundtrack
written entirely by Simon
and Garfunkel, with each
character having a theme
chosen from the bands
repertoire, with of course
hit song ‘Mrs Robinson’
being written specifically
for the film.
As people working to
hopefully graduate one
day, The Graduate is
equal parts refreshing and
bleak. Maybe we can hope
for something slightly
better for ourselves.

We’re in the thick of award season, making it a good time to throwback to a film that caused a buzz this time of
year in 1967.
