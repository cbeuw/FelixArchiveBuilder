constitution itself due
to its religious discrimi-
nation against people of
Islamic faith. Millions
have protested this bill
and the response by the
government has included
police brutality and more
internet shutdowns. The
Hindu nationalism created
by the BJP’s draconian
policies has the potential
to further slow the Indian
economy and cause more
unrest.
Present
Because of Modi’s
divisive policies, along
with an overall global
economic slowdown due
to other factors such as
the US-China trade war,
India’s economy has
slowed down to 4.75% in
2019. Additionally, during
the infrastructure boom in
the previous decade, many
companies couldn’t repay
their debts to the banks and
thus banks were resisting
giving out as many loans.
Shadow banks began to
form and fund projects,
and these non-bank ﬁnan-
cial companies (NBFC)
began to give out loans
to both companies and
individuals. At their peak
shadow banks accounted
for 1/3 of all loans given
out nationwide. A major
shadow-bank, Infrastruc-
ture Leasing & Financial
Services Ltd (IL&FS), de-
faulted on payments. This
shook the Indian economy
and had a particular
impact in the automotive
industry as nearly 65%
commercial vehicle sales
were from NBFCs. The
automotive industry is
one of India’s largest, em-
ploying 35 million people.
Due to this collapse of
IL&FS, ripples were felt
through the economy, car

sales dropped, and due
to decreased demand,
an estimated 100,000
jobs were lost. Despite
this, consumer spending
remains high, with many
Indian households still
taking out loans which
could potentially become
a harmful situation if
unemployment keeps
rising and people begin to
default on their payments.
The immediate future
is looking bleak; unem-
ployment has been rising
since 2017 and the IMF
has cut India’s 2020
growth forecast from 7%
to 5.8%. In addition to
this, a general slowing
of the global economy,
especially in other major
economies such as China
and Germany, are not
beneﬁcial to India’s pros-
pects in an increasingly
globalised world.
Politics writer Nehaal Pillai summarises the events that have led to India’s current economic turbulence. (cont.)
“With a predominantly young
workforce, large English-
speaking population, and
a large domestic consumer
population, it is entirely
possible that India will become
an economic superpower.
Conclusion
Ultimately, if global
market conditions
improve and the Indian
Government changes its
economic policies, stops
causing social unrest, and
lowers its import tariffs,
India’s economic growth
will skyrocket again.
With a predominantly
young workforce, large
English-speaking popula-
tion, and a large domestic
consumer population, it
is entirely possible and
likely that India will
become an economic
superpower. However, a
lot of change is required
in order to catch up with
the likes of China, the
European Union, and
the United States sooner
rather than in the distant
future.
