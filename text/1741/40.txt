Another Day, Another W for ICURFC

ast week saw
ICURFC play
their first game of
the new year as
Hertfordshire University
1s travelled to Harlington.
The boys had already
beaten Hertfordshire
twice this season, both
times quite comfortably.
Nevertheless, the boys
made sure they brought
their A-game as they need
bonus points from all
their remaining games to
secure promotion.
The boys didn’t get off
to the best start as within
the first five minutes Hert-
fordshire’s questionably
built fly-half kicked over
three points. However, this
served as a good wakeup
call for IC as they came
out back from the restart
fired up. Once possession
was regained the boys
showed how good they
can be in attack. Despite
the wet conditions, the
boys played some beauti-
ful free flowing, attacking
rugby which climaxed
with Amin throwing a
beautiful cut-out pass to
Isaac Bailey whose superb
offload allowed ICURFC
to get their first try of the
day.
After this very well
worked try not much more
can be said about the first
half. The wet ball resulted
in scrum after scrum and
questionable decisions
by the referee meant IC
found themselves camped
on their own try line for
the majority of the half.
One dimensional attack
from Hertfordshire and
gutsy defending from IC
meant that despite all the
pressure, Hertfordshire
couldn’t manage to get
over the line. Players to
thank for this include
Isaac Bailey and Nick
U-A who dominated the
Hertfordshire centres,
Ollie Adams who makes
bigger hits than a ~2000
Britney Spears and Sean
Nakai who chops more
ankles than Louis Benson
(claims) he chops pints.
Sean also managed to
bag a try in the first half.
Hertfordshire had clearly
done their research and
found that ICURFC have
a lineout maul that moves
faster than the Coronavi-
rus. To combat this they
attempted to stand off and
hope to gain a penalty
for obstruction. Although
this worked the first time,
the next time they tried it
Sean just grabbed the ball
and sprinted through the
unaware Hertfordshire
pack.
The second half was
quite different as IC
managed to gain much
more possession and
play in the right areas. It
wasn’t long before IC had
an attacking lineout in the
Hertfordshire 22. Toby
Daniels, threw a darts
Michael Van Gerwen
would be envious of,
setting up the maul for the
man himself to score yet
another try this season.
The boys were now
within a try of a bonus
point and even though
there was plenty of time on
the clock, IC kept the foot
on the gas after the restart.
Unfortunately, after two
tries were questionably
disallowed, Hertfordshire
managed to get off their
line. After many midfield
set pieces IC managed to
get into the Hertfordshire
22 by stealing a lineout.
Many hard carries led
to Bolu getting over the
try line but unfortunately
the referee once again
disallowed the try. As the
old saying goes, the ball
doesn’t lie, and IC scored
off the scrum after some
weak defending by the
Hertfordshire centres.
Now the bonus point
was sealed the boys could
relax and play their own
game as they continued to
dominate Hertfordshire.
Some absurdly filthy
champagne rugby saw
IC go eighty metres to
score a wonderful try but
once again the ref con-
troversially disallowed
it for a forward pass.
Imperial still managed to
bag another try though as
the IC pack outmuscled
Hertfordshire for Toby
Daniels to get himself a
second try of the match.
The game concluded
with Hertfordshire
scoring a consolation try
after a long time on the
IC try line. There are still
improvements to be made
as ICURFC play Kent
this week, a fixture which
looks likely to decide
promotion.
