An easy vegan recipe that is sure to impress
1. Rinse the mushrooms and drain. These
might seem larger than bite-sized, but you must
consider that mushrooms shrink considerably
when cooked. (They are about 92% water!)
2. Toss the mushrooms in the flour, corn-
starch, paprika, garam masala, and salt. (Add
chillies if you want at this stage, making more
of this dry mix if needed)
3. Toss the marinated mushrooms into the
warmed oil (check by dipping in a little bit of
the marinade to check if bubbles form), rotat-
ing when needed until they turn an even, or-
ange-brown colour. The original recipe calls
for deep frying, but as I’m not such a huge fan
of oil, I would recommend just enough oil in
the fry-pan to cover about half the mushrooms.
4. Add in chopped garlic pieces now, if you
like. Keep this at a low flame while all the wa-
ter escapes the mushroom!
5. While this is going, mix a blend of ketch-
up, chilli paste, and soy sauce until you have a
tangy sauce you like. Add sesame seeds to this
sauce, if you have some.
6. Once the mushrooms have been cooked,
drain the excess oil in the pan. The oil can be
reused for other meals, as mushrooms don’t
leave any smells. (This is another reason why I
wouldn’t recommend deep-frying; there is a lot
of oil used.)
D
ear readers, I
bring to you
a recipe that
went down so
well that a dinner party of
meat lovers were asking
for more of this gorgeous,
flavourful vegan dish.
This versatile dish can
stand on its own with a
bowl of rice, or be a side
dish in a late Lunar New
Year feast. If you aren’t a
huge fan of mushrooms,
maybe start with about
half of this recipe, or pass
along the leftovers to a
neighbour!

You’ve probably heard of
the whole Rebel Whopper
scandal, where the alleg-
edly vegan burgers are
cooked together with the
conventional meat patties.
From one angle, Burger
King is making an effort
to “revolutionise” their
menu. The blame lies
in the workers’ insensi-
tive negligence. From
another point of view, the
company itself is only
concerned with expanding
their target market without
consideration of vegan-
ism’s altruistic purpose.
It’s nothing new; compa-
nies have always leaped
at the opportunity to cap-
italise on impressionable,
trend-chasing ‘sheeple’.
Maybe it’s a combination
of both or none of these
perspectives.
Regardless, as long as
more people are turning to
and drawing attention to
plant-based diets, restau-
rants and companies will
follow suit. #Veganuary
