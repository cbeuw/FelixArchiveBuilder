Brexit Day: The Show is Over
I
still haven't finished
watching Netflix's
The Witcher.
Despite my best
efforts to procrastinate
as hard as possible, I
have not yet quite found
enough uncommitted time
to actually sit down and
watch it all. Partly, that's
because certain episodes
can be quite harrowing - I
genuinely took a break
after the ending scenes
of episode three left me
rather disturbed. Maybe
I'm just weak-willed and
should be culled from the
gene pool.
But that sense of horror,
revulsion, and morbid fas-
cination did not put me off
- just affected my pacing.
I still find myself creeping
back for another taste of
epic fantasy mixed with a
sort of gothic horror vibe.
Strip that drama from
theshow,andit'dbedecent
- but lacking something.
With it, I look forward
to devouring more. Upon
finishing, though, I'm sure
I will feel a little relieved
to have escaped that irre-
sistible attraction to the
morbid, the sense of not
being able to look away.
That's why films like Saw
or The Human Centipede
exist, too.
That's also how I think
we all feel about Brexit,
if we're being honest with
ourselves.
The last few years have,
frankly, been a f*cking
trainwreck for British
politics. We've seen
weak Prime Ministers, an
all-enveloping stagnancy
and lack of satisfaction
with the status quo, and
a complete lack of any
real impetus to change
those things. I think most
people reading this feel
broadly unrepresented
by even the party they
voted for. How many of
you simply voted for the
'lesser evil', whatever
you consider that to be?
How many genuinely feel
in-sync with the majority
of the politicians in your
respective parties? Even if
one or two seem to speak
genuine sense to you, the
rest are utterly useless and
ineffectual twats. Don't
deny it.
And so we've trundled
on, with a sort of ob-
sessive inward-facing
self-introspection that
hasn't been the focus of
British politics in some
time. It's been drama on
our own home soil, and it's
been some of the biggest
drama on the continent.
That's not totally normal
for us. It's been quite a
while since we were this
plagued with doubt; the
character of Britain's
political discourse, to me,
seems to have devolved
into resembling more the
self-conscious thoughts
of a preoccupied teenager
than a mature and estab-
lished state.
It's been a bit horrific,
really, having to face our-
selves, our own flaws, our
own errors. Very un-Brit-
ish, to have such a turgid
and quivering upper lip.
Maybe it'll all turn out
okay, a learning process
for the new generation.
But now the drama is
'over', so to speak. Not
on the political level, of
course - there's still lots
to do there. That is a hot,
hot mess. But in terms of
how this reaches down
and affects our daily
interactions, the long wait
is finally over. We're out.
It's done. Bish-bash-bosh.
The debates and argu-
ments that have fuelled
discourse - both external-
ly and, I think, internally
to ourselves - for so long
are moot.
For three years, we
all stood at the edge of a
foggy cliff, not knowing
whether jumping would
result in flight or death.
The arguing about what
to do has been vital, but it
has also forced us to look
into the void, to question
and define ourselves, and
that's affected us as a
society and as individuals.
Harrowing, yes.
But also just a little bit
addictive. A bit morbidly
fascinating.
With the date set, I
noticed a distinct drop-off
in the number of furious
rants I witnessed on social
media. While I'm sure
many who consider them-
selves political pundits
are still furiously typing
away, keyboard warriors
to the last, the average
person has suddenly gone
quiet where before they
were just so freaking
opinionated. Nobody - I
repeat, nobody - wrote
anything on it to Felix this
week; our editors took up
the mantle instead. That is
genuinely shocking.
Partially it's because it
feels that there isn't much
point to arguing anymore.
But, really, there is. If
someone really cares
about Brexit on a political
level, there is still so much
to do, and plenty to argue
about.
No, I think it's because
that dark addictive drama
is over. It's no longer
fashionable to take a side,
it's no longer an ongoing
cultural war, it's no longer
about self-questioning
and defining the direction
of a generation. It's no
longer such an attractive
mess. It's just a very po-
litically involved one. It
has to do with things like
tariffs. That is definitely
more boring than calling
the big B.J. a dickhead
and getting 32 likes. Good
one.
And, just like I antici-
pate finishing The Witcher
to be, it's a bit relieving
to finally set down our
well-worn pitchforks and
torches.
I do worry a little that
burning ourselves and
our political fervour out
now will allow the current
government to enact
legislation that otherwise
wouldn't go unquestioned
(Human Rights Act,
anyone?) However, I
think it's necessary. This
is the quiet little cry and
moment of clarity and
peace you have after a
big argument with your
partner, or after getting
a bad exam result back.
Cathartic, but necessary.
But we can't let it go on
too long, without falling
into a sort of placid de-
pression that ultimately is
more damaging than the
internal war we've faced
could ever be.
