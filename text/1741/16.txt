René Lalique, the “Jeweller of Art Nouveau”
Inspired by nature inspiring the future

T
he Art Nouveau
movement which
emerged in
France during
the Belle Epoque of the
1890s was born out of the
Arts and Crafts movement
which began in England
in the 1860s. Promoted
by artists such as William
Morris and the writer
Walter Crane, it came
as a reaction against the
mass production of luxury
items such as jewellery,
and from a desire to return
to the artisanal craft of
beautiful objects. The
Arts and Crafts movement
would influence the young
René Lalique (1860-1945)
during the two years he
spent in London at the
Sydenham School of Art
in 1878.
The lazy routine of
manufacturers who did
not renew their models
and put their firms into the
hands of their workers had
turned them into nothing
more than honest traders
and prudent suppliers,
and threatened to com-
promise the future of an
art form whose reason to
be seemed only to satisfy
public demand.
Lalique initiated the
radical transformation
which profoundly altered
modern jewellery in its
essential condition and in
its aspect, by tearing down
servile practices of imi-
tating ancient styles and
breaking the established
hierarchies which despot-
ically graduated materials
into their proper uses.
He used semi-precious
stones held in disdain
by his contemporaries,
who remained prejudiced
by the value of their
materials. Opal, ivory,
jade, malachite, as well
as materials such as glass,
leather, enamel, nacre and
horn were raised to the
rank of precious rubies,
emeralds or diamonds.
The spontaneous
manifestation of his
personal style and its
quiet contempt of dogma
incited astonishment,
defiance and hostility
when it was exhibited at
the Paris World Fair of
1895. However, by the
Paris World Fair of 1900,
his principles had been
adopted and imitated by
many others, cementing
them into a new definite
style, the Art Nouveau.
Moving in the artistic
and intellectual circles
of Paris society life, he
surrounded himself with
high society ladies who
demanded ever-more ex-
traordinary designs, and
became involved in their
sentimental lives. They
included the soprano
Emma Calvé, poet Renée
Vivien, courtesan Liane
de Pougy, and American
playwright, poet and
novelist Natalie Clifford
Barney. Above all, it was
his association with the
great Sarah Bernhardt,
who wore his designs both
in the street and on stage,
which helped to establish
his reputation.
Natalie Clifford Barney
discovered the jewellery
of René Lalique during
first jewellers to revive
the use of the female nude
during the 19th century –
he introduced new aspects
of femininity, of sinuous
form, expressive char-
acter and tragic accents,
in composite forms as
sphinxes or mermaids, or
with ardent and passionate
profiles underneath their
flowing hair.
His jewellery exalts
and fauna of his garden in
his Rambouillet property
which he acquired in 1898
and which provided inex-
haustible inspiration.
As a child growing up
in the countryside town
of Ay in the Champagne
region of France, his
natural talent for obser-
vation and drawing was
stimulated during Sunday
forest walks with his
grandfather. He would
make sketches from of
flowers and insects and
embellish them back at
home. As a jeweller he
would look back towards
the fantastic bestiary
of his childhood and
be inspired, borrowing
the elegant, undulating
lines from the curves of
bending flower stems,
stamens and pistils in his
work. Dragonflies became
pendants, women with
butterfly wings figured on
brooches, brambles and
thistles became hair and
corsage ornaments. The
humble violet, cowslip,
nasturtium and dandelion
became classic leitmotifs
in women’s jewellery in
an age of growing indus-
trialisation.
A sublime example of
a thistle corsage ornament
is found in the Judith and
Bollinger Gallery at the
V&A. An aquamarine
stone at the centre draws
the eye into its transpar-
ent depths, bordered by
two round glass thistle
stems with finely detailed
prickles and bristles
which are framed by sharp
diamond spines.
Lalique excelled at an
interpretation of fauna
and flora proper to or-
namental art, which was
neither a copy of a page
from a botanical album
or entomological atlas,
nor riddled with preten-
sions to symbolism – he
remained faithful to nature
whilst the thought which
he expressed remained
simple to grasp. It is this
interpretation which, to
this day, retains the power
to captivate the imagina-
tion when peered through
a glass case and enables
his jewellery to exist as
an independent work of
art, long after the wearer
whose beauty it was
designed to embellish.

her affair with Liane de
Pougy. In 1899, Liane
gifted her a ring made
from silver, blue enamel
and opals, ornamented
with a bat, a symbol of
homosexual love at the
time (bat sexuality was
first studied in 1895 by
Raymond Rollinat and
Édouard Louis Troues-
sart). Later on, it would
be Renée Vivien’s turn
to cover Natalie with
Lalique crystal, ivory
and enamel ornaments
and flowers (“She would
make me wear them on
my neck, arms, fingers
and on my ankles” Natalie
would later write).
Jewellery could no
longer be merely a
respectable trade of skil-
fully mounted gems – the
skill of the stone cutter,
setter and engraver no
longer sufficed. Lalique’s
creations, full of audacity
and charm, conquered a
place in jewellery-making
equal to that of an artist or
a poet; his works incited
as much passion and con-
troversy as a painting or a
sculpture.
Lalique was one of the

nature in its infinite
variety. He created rare
and expressive harmonies
through careful studies
of the animal and plant
kingdoms, composing
materials together like
a painter with a colour
palette. Lalique spent long
moments observing and
photographing the flora
