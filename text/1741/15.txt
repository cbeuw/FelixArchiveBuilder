Disney and Dicks: The Fairytale
“
Like Disney?
Like Cock? Then
you’ll love Happily
Ever Poofter, the
smash hit Disney musical
parody!” is the tagline
the creators of the show
decided to go with and
as a frequent consumer
of both, how could I not
attend this show? I’m
happy to report that not
only did it deliver on its
premise, it did so with
fabulous style, cutting
wit, and a huge amount of
heart.
Set predictably far,
far away, the one-man
show follows Prince
Henry (Rich Watkins),
self-professed “only gay
in the kingdom”. In an
effort to find his commu-
nity, his fairy godmother
wishes him away to a
land much closer to our
own - London’s gay
scene. Plunging head (or
arse) first into the reali-
ties of modern-day gay
relationships, he must find
his true love, expose his
truth back at home, and
gain acceptance from a
deeply heterosexual world
in order to have his own
happily ever after.
With a production value
probably amounting to
little more than a night out
in London, the show could
have suffered but the in-
credibly lo-fi set coupled
with campy costume
choices only focused
audience attention on the
star of the show. And what
a star! Dancing, singing,
and… puppeteering his
way through the whole
production, Watkins never
let the energy in the room
dip, forging through with
sweat-fuelled vigour.
Even the audience
participation with its
panto-esque feel was kept
well-balanced and well-
spaced throughout the
show, preventing it from
falling into pure farce. As
a testament to his skill in
handling the audience,
one scene involving an
unwilling (and tragically
bland) audience member
was kept lively and
humorous thanks to some
quick thinking and plenty
of sass.
The song covers, a
selection of Disney’s
greatest hits, were bawdy,
innuendo-laden affairs.
Some songs such as ‘I’ve
Just Come Out to the
King’ were a stroke of
genius and in this particu-
lar case, sung far better
than the child-Simba cur-
rently gracing the Lyceum
stage in West End’s own
Lion King. Other songs
such as ‘Part of that
Scene’, while funny, may
lack some context into the
original work. Howard
Ashman, the original
lyricist, was a gay man
living in the height of the
AIDS epidemic in the US
and finally succumbed to
the disease merely two
years after The Little
Mermaid’s release. There
is no doubt in my mind
that when Ariel sings of
her desire to belong in the
human world, it echoed
Ashman’s own feelings
of alienation in our real
world. To parody the song
in this particular way was
either a tremendous act
of subversion or a slight
misstep for the show.
Similarly, I didn’t feel
that ‘Let It Go’, a song
already championed as
a gay anthem, needed to
be parodied to make the
same point as the original
song.
One could argue over
the finer points of the
show such as its focus
on the gay sex scene as a
representation of a whole
LGBTQ+ community, but
as a piece of fun, family
-friendly entertainment,
it hit all the right notes in
expressing the importance
of explicit representation
and acceptance.
What Will it Take to Break You Out of Racial Igno-
rance?
T
he Glass Will
Shatter. There
is no choice,
but it simply
will, Eventually. This
thought-provoking play
forces you to confront and
acknowledge the different
narratives which surround
everyday racism, and no
longer view the issue from
a distance, protected by a
pane of glass. This small,
3-woman cast combined
with well-timed and
impressive light work,
kept the audience steadily
engaged throughout, and
never gave you a chance
to get too comfortable
before suddenly changing
the tone of the scene.
The opening scene
sets the mood for the rest
of the play with its use of
symbolism to depict the
traumatic dreams which
the main character, Re-
becca (Josephine Arden),
is still experiencing. She
dreams vividly about
what happened in her
classroom almost 10 years
ago with a troublesome
student, Amina (Naima
Swaleh). We engage with
Rebecca’s character and
sympathise with the kind
of struggles which she
must have been through
after the event, but soon
we step past the glass and
watch the scenario objec-
tively. We retrospectively
see how Rebecca strug-
gles as a white teacher to
relate to and understand
issues of faith and culture
between her, Amina, and
her fellow teaching col-
league, the latter two of
which are Somali.
The characters swift-
ly move the set around
to switch us from scene
to scene, and as the pace
of the play speeds up, the
audience’s attention is
in the palm of the actors.
We slowly understand
how the racial microag-
gressions and ignorance
displayed by Rebecca es-
calated the issue at hand
and led to her causing
more harm than good.
The play tastefully edu-
cates us about how the
Prevent Policy affects the
dynamic between teacher
and student, and how it
can further exacerbate is-
sues to do with race. Af-
ter a very tense build up
to what really happened
in the classroom 8 years
ago, we’re snapped back
to present day to view
Rebecca’s narrative in a
different light and see her
false sense of victimhood
being used as a defense
mechanism to avoid con-
fronting the consequences
of her actions.
The tone, pace, and
style of the play were
brilliantly designed and
pieced together to help
us question ourselves and
view social issues in a dif-
ferent light, without being
patronising or preachy.
The show was fully cap-
tioned, which was stylis-
tically thought-out with
the fonts for each char-
acter symbolising their
personality, rather than
just a shabby attempt at
making the show more
accessible and not actual-
ly integrating the captions
into the storyline. Overall,
this was an amazing piece
which will urge you to re-
think social constructs and
facades, as it is inevitable
that the glass will shatter.
