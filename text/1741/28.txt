L
ast Tuesday,
Union Council
voted to approve
the introduction
of a student Officer to
represent students from
socio-economically dis-
advantaged backgrounds.
This was mainly due to
Shervin Sabeghi, Deputy
President for Welfare,
with the support of the
Community and Welfare
Board which I sit on
as a Constituent Union
Welfare Officer. This is
a welcome improvement
to how Council deals
with socio-economic
inequality, given that
similar proposals failed
twice in 2018. Joining
the ranks of the newly
reformed Liberation and
Community Networks,
the student elected to this
position will lead a group
of representatives to tackle
the most unacceptable
aspect of this university:
how it interacts with the
poorest of our society.
It’s no secret that
Imperial is one of the
most unequal universities
in the UK. In 2017, the
most recent year for
which UCAS published
data, Imperial had the
biggest gap in entry rate
between students from
the most and least advan-
taged areas out of all UK
universities. Out of the 7
most unequal universities
according to this metric,
Imperial was the only
university to actually get
worse between 2010 and
2017. Oxford, Cambridge,
Bristol, King’s, SOAS,
UCL, Durham and Brunel
all decreased the entry rate
ratio in this timeframe.
Why should Imperial be
any different?.
Even if the gap in
entry rate was improved,
the change in drop-out
rates across socio-eco-
nomic status is damning.
Students from the most
disadvantaged areas of
the UK are twice as likely
to drop out than those
from the most advantaged
areas – a drop-out rate of
8.1% compared to 3.7%.
This is true even though
College has a decent
are obvious: it’s outdated,
working class is used as
an insult, you can be poor
without being working
class, you can be working
class without being poor,
and so on. Having the
word Class at all is a
reminder of the system we
have to operate within.
But are the alternatives
better? All other terms are
unrelatable, vague, and
reek of trying to erase
identities and reinforce
certain ideals. Social
Mobility and Widening
Participation both put
emphasis on moving
disadvantaged students
into the middle-class
way of life. It could be
argued we need a label
to identify with, like with
BME and LGBTQ+, and
unfortunately Working
Class is the only label that
exists that is short enough
- Students from Disadvan-
taged Socio-Economic
Backgrounds Officer
obviously wouldn’t fit on
any election handouts.
With pressure from
outside of Council, it
looks like it’ll be changed
to Widening Participation
(WP) Officer to be con-
sistent with the language
that College use in their
admissions and financial
aid processes. Applicants
have started referring
to themselves as WP
students, decreasing the
impact of the argument
that Working Class is the
only term that students
will understand and
identify with. But is this
still a way of saying that
the poor have to partici-
pate in and conform to the
liberal middle-class ideals
that Imperial sets out for
them? Or should we take
it at face value, as a simple
way to say that we want as
wide a group as possible
to have the opportunity to
participate in education?
The fact we even have
to talk about the name is
a hint that something is
wrong with how we talk
about socio-economic
inequality. Instead of
pushing hard against the
actions of College we beat
around the bush and erase
the identities of those
from disadvantaged back-
grounds by pigeonholing
them in language that isn’t
representative or useful.
We spend hours coming
up with the best name to
propose to Council so
that it doesn’t get voted
down according to their
middle-class biases and
preconceptions, instead
of refining how exactly
the Officer can campaign
effectively against the
planned rent price hikes
and the eye-watering cost
of living.
Interestingly, in 2018
this proposal didn’t fail
because of the criticisms
above. The then-Deputy
President for Welfare said
the role “would function
more to single out than
to represent”. Effectively,
the criticism is that the
project and the term itself
‘others’ the working class.
Othering is a morally
bankrupt concept that we
could just as well use to
justify telling anyone who
isn’t a rich straight white
male to stop bringing
attention to their differ-
ences. Anyone supporting
this position should also
be in favour of removing
the LGBTQ+, BME, and
Gender Equality networks
entirely. Luckily, this was
quickly dismissed this
time round, but the fact
that it came up at all is a
symptom of the problem-
atic way in which we talk
about class inequality.
Regardless of the
name, I’m optimistic that
a Union Officer in this
role will give a greater
voice to students that have
been let down by Imperi-
al’s failure to be inclusive.
Hopefully they can be
honest about the problems
and represent students
effectively, improving the
way in which Union talks
about class as well as
campaigning hard against
College. Imperial cannot
go on increasing the gap
between the richest and
poorest in society within
its student body. This is
a much-needed first step
in campaigning against
discrimination, commu-
nicating the issues within
Union more effectively,
and giving more power
and voice to those who
need it most.
“Students
from the most
disadvantaged
areas of the
UK are twice as
likely to drop
out as those
from the most
advantaged”
bursary scheme (without
which I wouldn’t have
been able to study here at
all). This shows that it’s
not just about the absurd
cost of living in South
Kensington, it’s also the
culture shock and the atti-
tudes of the student body,
and the way in which all
of this is made worse by
academic pressure and
strained mental health
support services. These
more subtle issues are
exactly the motivation
behind introducing Union
Officer positions with this
in their remit.
So, will this new Union
Officer help? Well, first
let’s address the fact that I
haven’t told you the name
of the role yet.
This project was
approved within minutes
by the Community and
Welfare Board before it
got to Union Council, but
we struggled to agree on a
name before circling back
to Working Class Officer.
Whenever I bring this up
to someone their facial
expression is like I just
drop-kicked their dog.
