Mother Earth hates Men: Global Warming is the sexist
air-conditioner of the world
HANGMAN
Global warming is
a ploy by women to
heat up the world
to fit their inferior
metabolic rates.

ollowing a study
that most offices
have tempera-
tures adjusted
for the body tempera-
tures of men, meaning
women are left feeling
cold and (dare I say it)
straight up frigid, we
can now say for certain
that, actually, Mother
Earth is a bra-burning
femi-Nazi. With world
temperatures rising at
unprecedented rates, the
only conceivable expla-
nation is that Mother
Earth wishes to see men
– and only men – suffer
for the superior meta-
bolic rates they were
born with.
“The temperature of
our office aims to be
adjusted for the thermal
comfort of 80% of our
staffers, mostly men,”
explains CEO of Large
Corporate, “and unfor-
tunately it is completely
beyond our control that
we hire more men.” We
now know that this un-
preventable phenomenon
has caused females, who
all just always want to
take off their clothes, and
smash glass ceilings to
let out the air-con, to turn
to heating up the entire
world instead.
Insider knowledge
tells us that Mother Earth
had a meeting with these
females back in the 1990s,
where they hatched a plan
to raise world tempera-
tures as fast as possible.
In fact, solid scientific
evidence has been mount-
ing that Mother Earth, and
indeed all of the effects
of climate change, carry
highly androphobic sen-
timents. “For what other
reason would there be
rising sea levels other than
their knowledge that I, a
male, and I’m sure many
other men, can’t swim?”
argues famous climate
activist Groto Thunberd.
“Why else would there
be forest fires, if not to
get rid of the log cabins
and camping sites we use
to hide from our wives
and spend our male-on-
ly bonding times?”
Not only has this
meant rising global tem-
peratures, further inves-
tigation shows that there
is a decreasing supply
of fossil fuels for office
air-conditioning, instead
being funnelled under the
control of women towards
uses that would contribute
more to global warming.
We interviewed a
standard member of the
male species, Feb Senton,
to tell us what men around
the world are thinking.
When asked about solu-
tions to appease women’s
finicky office thermal
comfort, he responded,
“I think women are just
faking it. I mean, look at
what they wear, it’s like
they’re asking to feel cold.
Besides, we all know that
when a woman tells you
Just wear more clothes! // Wikimedia
she’s cold she’s actually
hinting that she feels
warm, you know how
women love to play hard-
to-get. And you know
there’s been so much talk
about consent, so why
isn’t that being carried
over into temperature? If
your molecules want to
vibrate slower, just tell
them no, isn’t that how
consent works?”
Action against climate
change needs to be taken
immediately. You can do
your part by staying out of
Mother Earth’s way until
she gets over this meno-
pause phase or whatever
it is until she stops acting
crazy. #savethemen

“We all know
that when a
woman tells
you she is cold,
she’s actually
hinting that
she is warm”
Although global warming
is a natural phenomenon,
woman-made climate
change is accelerating it
by magnitudes.
