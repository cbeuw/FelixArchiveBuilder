Central Banks and Monetary Policy Implementation
time, a minimum amount
of money, usually in cash
form. This ensures that
the bank can still function
in the case that many of its
customers decide to with-
draw their savings at once,
thus avoiding default.
Interaction with for-proﬁt
ﬁnancial institutions also
entails lending to them.
Every central bank sets
the base rate, which is
the rate it charges its
commercial counterparts
for borrowing from it. A
decrease in the base rate
allows a commercial bank
to reduce its borrowing
cost. Hence, it can loan
money to its customers
at a lower interest rate.
Consequently, it can
be argued that central
banks set interest rates
for the entire economy.
Nowadays,severalofthem
are considered independ-
ent from the government,
which means they do not
receive orders about how
to perform their duties,
such as setting interest
rates. However, they still
do need to cooperate with
the Ministries of Finance,
as they provide advice to
ministers and coordinate
with them on matters of
general economic policy.
Monetary Policy
Monetary policy can be
deﬁned as the set of deci-
sions taken by the central
bank regarding the supply
of money in the economy,
in order to achieve certain
economic targets, such as
a lower unemployment
rate, or boosting economic
output. Money supply
refers to the total amount
of currency, i.e. coins,
cash, balances in current
and savings accounts, cir-
culating in the economy. It
can be broadly classiﬁed
into expansionary and
contractionary.
Expansionary monetary
policy is deemed essential
at times of recession. It
usually entails cutting
interest rates with the goal
of encouraging consumers
to spend rather than save
money and allow ﬁrms
and individuals to borrow
funds on improved terms.
As a result, businesses
will invest more resources
into providing a larger
number of higher quality
products and consumers
will respond to that
shift by increasing their
spending. Hence, unem-
ployment will decrease,
and the economy will exit
the recessionary stage.
However, expansionary
policy can also lead to a
higher rate of inﬂation.
Inﬂation is the phenome-

non related to the general
tendency of product prices
to rise over time. An
uncontrollable increase
of inﬂation will cause a
decrease in consumer’s
purchasing power. The
reason why this happens is
that the injection of money
into the economy cannot
instantaneously lead to a
rise in output. Therefore,
for a certain time period,
a larger amount of cash
is being used to purchase
essentially the same
number of goods. As
per the Law of Supply,
if the supply remains
constant, higher demand
will lead to higher prices.
A higher inﬂation rate
may therefore cancel the
gains of an expansionary
monetary policy. Contrac-
tionary policy is therefore
required to combat rising
inﬂation. Particularly,
the money supply is
decreased, aimed at dis-
couraging borrowing and
spending. By decreasing
demand, given a constant
supply, producers will
begin to reduce prices,
and thus inﬂation will be
brought under control.
However, this policy has
the undesirable effects of
slowing down growth and
causing an upswing in
unemployment.
How does the Central
Bank Determine Mone-
tary Policy?

as a technique when the

not an optimal choice, as
it is directly linked with

the methods discussed

preferable.

A
central bank
has a different
mission from a
conventional,
commercial bank: it oper-
ates in the public’s interest
as it seeks to promote eco-
nomic development. The
ﬁrst central bank was
established in the UK.
Namely, the Bank of
England was founded in
1694. Since the Brussels
Financial Conference of
1920, a central bank has
been established in almost
all countries around
the world. A central
bank’s most fundamental

to all investment products
offered by the govern-
ment, with bonds being
the most common. Bonds
can be generally thought
of as a type of loan. In
this case, the government
sells these to commercial
banks, among other
investors, in exchange
for a certain amount,
which must be repaid at a
speciﬁc date. During that
waiting period, the bank
is unable to proﬁt from
this activity. During a re-
cession, central banks will
offer to buy government
bonds from mainstream
banks, allowing the latter
to immediately generate
a proﬁt. Consequently,
ﬁnancial institutions will
have more capital availa-
ble to lend to consumers,
which combined with
lower rates, will render
borrowing more attrac-
tive. In a particularly dire
economic climate, central
banks will introduce a
quantitative-easing (QE)
program that takes the
policy of buying govern-
ment investment products
a step further. Central
banks purchase bonds
directly, which have been
issued by governments
and ﬁrms. Thus, the
entities which have issued
the bonds immediately
receive capital in the
form of payment for the
purchase of these bonds.
Hence ﬁrms, mainly
banks, can lend money
more easily, leading to a
rise in the money supply.
Conclusion
Central banks have
indisputably become one
of the leading actors in
the economy. Nowadays,
a policy announced by
the governor of a central
bank directly impacts the
economic climate not only
in the region, but perhaps
globally. Given that the
global economy has not
yet been able to ﬁnd
itself in a path of sluggish
growth, central banks will
continue to be the protag-
onists of ﬁnancial news
and commentary.

permission from the gov-
ernment to print money. A
central bank differs from
a traditional institution in
another way: it does not
interact with the general
public. Instead, it deals
only with commercial
banks because regulating
the latter’s activities
constitutes another part
of their mission. Financial
regulations are rules
designed to control the
economic behaviour of
ﬁrms in the private sector.

previously mentioned,
the base rate determines
the interest charged to
banks borrowing from the

reducing the base rate
leads to a drop in the cost
of loans for commercial
banks. This then translates
into reduced interest rates
for consumers. Further-
more, the purchase and

rities represents another
way for central banks
to affect the amount of
