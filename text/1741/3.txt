ext week will
see the launch
of Solar
Orbiter, a
European Space Agency
(ESA) mission designed
to study the Sun and
solar wind. Onboard
the spacecraft is an
instrument developed by
scientists and engineers
in Imperial’s Space and
Atmospheric Physics
group, part of the De-
partment of Physics.
The 1800-kilogram
spacecraft will fly within
42 million kilometres
of the Sun, inside the
orbit of Mercury. Via
multiple gravity assists
around Venus it will rise
out of the ecliptic plane,
relaying the first images
of the Sun’s poles. The
Imperial-built magneto-
meter will provide in-situ
measurements of the
Sun’s complex magnetic
field as it is carried out
into interplanetary space
by the solar wind – a con-
stant stream of charged
particles blowing off the
Sun. Solar Orbiter will
compliment and work
in tandem with NASA’s
Parker Solar Probe,
launched in August 2018.
The magnetometer is
one of ten instruments
onboard the spacecraft.
Solar Orbiter is notable
as an ESA mission with
significant UK contribu-
tion; as well as Imperial’s
instrument, it also carries
a Solar Wind Plasma
Analyser built by the
Mullard Space Science
Laboratory at UCL, and
the spacecraft itself was
assembled by Airbus
Defence and Space in
Stevenage.
Launching from Cape
Canaveral, Florida, on
a NASA Atlas V 411
rocket, the launch window
is scheduled to open on
February 8th, 4:15am
GMT. The possible launch
window lasts three weeks,
for two hours per day.
These are the times when
the Earth’s rotation and
position relative to Venus
allow the rocket to follow
the required trajectory.
Exactly when within the
window it blasts off is
uncertain - delays to the
launch are common and
can occur due to adverse
weather conditions or
minor technical issues.
Understanding the
solar wind is important
for forecasting space
weather. This is the set of
phenomena experienced
as the solar wind impacts
and interacts with Earth’s
magnetic field. It is
responsible for the forma-
tion of the aurora, but in
extreme events can also
cause mass power grid
failures and disable GPS
networks. Such events
have occurred in the past
– for example, in 1989 a
severe geomagnetic storm
caused a blackout across
Quebec for over nine
hours, costing their state-
owned energy company an
estimated $13.2 million.
As is often the case with
scientific spacecraft, the
journey to launch has been
a long one. While the first
technical proposal for the
magnetometer was drafted
in 2007, the mission itself
was proposed by the
scientific community in
2000. “It’s been a rocky
road, and there have been
times when it’s been quite
