Marshall Mathers’ Murder Music Makes A Mark
Despite his legacy as one of hip hop’s greats, Eminem has had a turbulent few years attempting to find his place
in the culture’s modern day. A somewhat reimagined Slim Shady on this new effort sounds like a step in the right
direction
“
The giant’s woke,
eyes open, undenia-
ble” - and it seems
that he is here to stay.
This is the second time
that Eminem has surprised
us with an unannounced
album in the past 2 years.
Music To Be Murdered By
is truly a unique addition
in the Eminem discog-
raphy, inspired by and
featuring cuts from Alfred
Hitchcock’s homonymous
album released in 1958.
Evidently benefiting from
Dr. Dre’s involvement,
the album is musically
superior to its predeces-
sor Kamikaze, but it has
also allowed time for the
rapper to develop a return
of his Slim Shady alter
ego. Don’t get me wrong,
this album is not on
the same level as The
Marshall Mathers LP - in
fact nothing ever will be
- but Slim is truly back,
albeit in slightly more
mature form.
Tracks ‘Premonition’
and ‘Unaccommodating’
at the beginning of the
album seem to pick up
from the aftermath of
Kamikaze, referencing
bad reviews from critics,
his 2017 effort Revival
and of course the most
recent in his beef with
Machine Gun Kelly.
However, this is a new,
more self-aware Shady
who realises that he might
have misplaced his anger
in his previous album.
“I could keep beefin’,
fuck is the point?”, Em
points out on the track
‘Marsh’. Clearly, he is
confused with his position
in the current rap game,
especially evident on ‘No
Regrets’ where contrary
to the title of the track, he
admits that his Tyler, the
Creator diss on his last
album was indeed wrong.
Hate and anger have
been the lifeblood of
Eminem’s early career
and some of his best work
has indeed stemmed out
of his childhood issues.
Even at 47, Slim is clearly
still angry (or rather has
forgotten how not be).
But tracks like ‘Stepdad’ ,
‘Yah Yah’ , ‘Little Engine’
and ‘Those Kinda Nights’
benefit from this nihilistic
rage and bring back
the graphic, gruesome
imagery of his early
2000’s style coupled with
old school beats and a
drug-infused atmosphere
reminiscent of The Slim
Shady LP. In the latter, Em
admits being taken back to
his D12 days by the beat,
which would have been
entirely true for me as a
listener had it not been
for Ed Sheeran’s feature
on the chorus, which
comes across as out of
place against the reckless,
drugged-out party action
backdrop. In fact, a few
of the choruses on this
project sound like rushed,
overboard attempts at
catchiness with rock and
acoustic touches.
Nevertheless, Em’s
voice, lyrical skill and
rawness in combination
with very fitting features
including the late Juice
WRLD on ‘Godzilla’ and
Em’s long-time friend
Royce da 5’9’’ on ‘Yah
Yah’ , ‘I Will’ and of
course the stand out ‘You
Gon’ Learn’ make up
for these flaws. To me,
‘Godzilla’ is a statement
or rather a reminder that
Eminem is one of the
best to ever do it, with the
rapper breaking his own
record (see ‘Rap God’)
of the fastest rap verse,
spitting a staggering 10.65
syllables per second on
the track’s third verse.
On ‘In Too Deep’,
‘Never Love Again’ and
‘Farewell’, Eminem
seems to dwell once more
on the multitude of failed
romantic relationships that
he’s had in the past, the
prime example being his
dysfunctional, co-depend-
ed marriage with ex-wife
Kim Scott. Eminem also
addresses the loss of his
father – who died recently
at the age of 67 – for the
first time on the track
‘Leaving Heaven’. Just
like on ‘Cleanin’ Out
My Closet’ 17 years ago,
Em’s resentment towards
him is made entirely clear.
On the track, he holds his
father responsible for his
problematic childhood
but also thanks him for
not being there for him
because it led to his
industry success. Despite
lines like “I hate that I’ll
never get to say “I hate
you” to your face”, the
track feels like Eminem’s
own twisted way of saying
goodbye to his father and
perhaps letting go of some
of that anger.
‘Darkness’ is truly
where the album shines
- chilling, alarming and
goose-bump inducing. In
this track, Em describes
the last moments before
the 2017 mass shooting
at the Las Vegas Route
91 Harvest music festival
from the eyes of the
shooter, attempting to
unravel the thoughts of
the shooter. He includes
details such as concern
that the festival will be
underattended and that
mass shootings are such
a common occurrence
now that the massacre
might not attract as much
such sensitive subjects in
a unique and compelling
way.
Overall, this album
is something special
– hearing Slim Shady
trying to re-establish
himself in the current era
is intriguing to say the
least. Although it cannot
be compared to Em’s
first couple of LPs, the
project is far from a failed
attempt at bringing back
his hedonistic, horrorcore
persona, rather a rebirth
and maturing of it. If you
have listened to the album
and felt disappointed, I
hope that this review will
make you at least give it
a second chance. To quote
Hitchcock’s outro to the
album, “If you haven’t
been murdered, I can only
say. Better luck next time.
If you have been, good-
night wherever you are.”
