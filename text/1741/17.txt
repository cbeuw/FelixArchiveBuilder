IC F&D Soc Welcomes You to The Past
A
s we step into
the new decade,
what would
be a better
time to reminiscence and
celebrate to the tunes of
some of the best music
ever made? How about a
musical bonanza contrast-
ing what’s trending now
to the music of another
time? Come and jam with
us as we travel to the 80s
and 00s in our nostalgic
80s vs 00s fashion show!!
This year, IC Fashion
& Design returns with our
flagship fashion show -
‘Billie Jean… is crazy in
love’ - a creative tribute to
two of the greatest music
decades. Directed by
Malinda Davies, the show
will feature iconic artists
such as Madonna, Michael
Jackson, Beyoncé and
Britney, the catwalk will
be half-performance,
half-party! We have
talented guest performers,
Imperielles and Funkol-
ogy, performing between
catwalks with guests en-
couraged to dance along
during the show. The fun
doesn’t just end after the
show though, we plan
to continue well into the
night at the afterparty at
Sway Bar.
The show will support
ClientEarth, a charity pas-
sionate about the using the
legal power to fight for our
environment and protect
our planet. Much like how
this show combines the
skills and talents from a
multitude of areas – not
only in modelling, but
also in dance, music, pho-
tography, art and graphic
design – we believe that
in order to curb climate
change and make change
for the better, we need
to involve a wide range
of talents and solutions
from individual efforts to
government lobbying.
So please come and
support IC FAD’s flagship
Charity Fashion Show in
the Union Concert Hall
on the 7th February.
Tickets can be found and
purchased on the Union
Website with or without
afterparty.
