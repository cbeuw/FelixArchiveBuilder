Why are the Union Electing a Working Class Officer

Shervin Sabeghi
Deputy President (Welfare)
L
ast week, your
Union Council
voted to accept
a proposal to
reform Liberation and
Community at the Union.
As well as introducing
networks attached to each
existing officer to give
students a mechanism to
campaign and advocate
for underrepresented
groups, we have intro-
duced a new Liberation
Officer to represent stu-
dents from disadvantaged
backgrounds, titled the
‘Working Class Officer’.
Background
Throughout its history,
advocating for the equal
rights of minority groups
has been a core part of the
Student Union movement.
This persists to this day,
and at Imperial this is
done through our eight
Liberation and Communi-
ty Officers. These officers
are senior volunteer
roles at the Union with
a lot of responsibility,
and throughout my 2.5
years being involved in
Union welfare, I’ve seen
that being able to do the
role fully and well is im-
possible for one person.
As Deputy President
(Welfare), Liberation and
Community falls under
my responsibility, along
with ensuring that all
officers are supported.
This drove me to look at
ways we can change the
structure around Libera-
tion and Community to
make sure that the Union
is successfully represent-
ing the students we claim
we do.
Liberation Reform
Project
This led to a Liberation
Reform project – which I
was keen to be a co-pro-
duced piece of work with
the Union’s Community
and Welfare Board, pri-
marily the Liberation and
Community Officers who
sit on it. After setting up a
working group and having
discussions at this board,
we came to a proposal
for Union Council which
passed 32 to 1. There
were two key parts to this
proposal, and you can
read the full paper on the
Union website.
1. Introduce Liber-
ation and Community
Networks chaired by the
respective Liberation
and Community Officer.
These networks will have
similarities to clubs and
societies in that they are
groups students can join
and will have commit-
tees. However, they will
differ in the sense that
their main purpose is to
campaign and advocate.
The key benefit of this is
that it allows Liberation
and Community officers
to be supported and to
spread the workload in a
student-led, democratic
fashion. My hope is that
these networks will be
able to do more campaigns
to improve the experience
of the students they repre-
sent without overloading
one officer.
2 Introduce a
Working Class Officer,
along with a Working
Class Students Network,
to represent students from
disadvantaged socio-eco-
nomic backgrounds.
Where did this new
officer come from?
Inlate2019,theCollege
agreed a five-year Access
and Participation
Plan with the Office for
Students, who are the reg-
ulator for universities in
England. This plan ties the
College to achieving key
targets around increasing
the numbers of students
who come from disad-
vantaged backgrounds.
The two key measures of
this are the IMD (Index
of Multiple Depriva-
tion) which score small
regions in England based
on relative deprivation,
and POLAR4 (Partici-
pation Of Local Areas)
which rates participation
in education across dif-
ferent postcodes. Both are
most commonly described
in terms of quintiles,
where Q5 for both repre-
sents the least deprived/
highest participation
areas. According to the
plan, considering Under-
graduate home student
admissions, there is a gap
between IMD Q1 and Q5
of 24.8% and POLAR4 Q1
and Q5 by 54.2%. Whilst
this aligns strongly with
the general perception of
students at Imperial, it’s
quite alarming to see the
numbers on paper. A huge
55% of the UG home
student population come
from POLAR4 Q5, the
quintile with the highest
participation rate in higher
education.
The concerning statis-
tics don’t stop just with
admission rates, though
less significant; there
are also gaps in success
rates for different groups
of students upon arrival
to Imperial. The contin-
uation rate for students
from POLAR Q5 is
as to why this is the case
aren’t very well explored
in the Access and Partici-
pation Plan, or elsewhere.
The plan has set targets
to increase the proportion
of POLAR Q1 and Q2
students, and IMD Q1
students, with the aim of
equalising the numbers
across all quintiles in
50 years. In terms of
success, the plan says the
College will monitor gaps
in success but doesn’t
seek to close the gap as
it deems it not currently
significant enough.
The College are putting
considerable energy into
bringing in students from
socio-economically dis-
advantaged backgrounds,
but are not equally con-
sidering what provision
to put in place to ensure
these students are able
to succeed to the same
extent as their peers. If
a student from an IMD
Q1 area has accessed
Imperial through the same
admissions criteria as a
student from an IMD Q5
area, the question I ask
myself is then “What is it
about Imperial that makes
students from disadvan-
taged socio-economic
backgrounds less likely to
succeed?”
This is where the Union
comes in. We have a duty
to represent the interests
and needs of all students,
and to particularly focus
on disadvantaged and
underrepresented groups.
This is the primary reason-
ing for introducing a new
Working Class Officer.
I envision a large part
of this role will be to try
and answer the question
above and start to change
these things. When
York Students’ Union
introduced an officer with
this same name, they
commissioned a research
project conducted by this
officer to try and establish
what the experience of
disadvantaged students
at York is. This project
found that challenges
faced were far broader
than financial, and that
students in the Working
Class Students Network
felt culture shock and that
they were “the odd one
out”. You can find out
more about this at https://

should-sus-elect-a-work-
ing-class-officer/. I think
it would be fascinating for
a similar piece of work to
happen at Imperial.
Why the name‘Work-
ing Class Officer’?
While it was quickly
and unanimously decided
to introduce an officer
with the remit of repre-
senting students from dis-
advantaged backgrounds
at the Union’s Commu-
nity and Welfare Board,
the question of what to
name it was a lot harder
to resolve. The initial re-
actions to Working Class
Officer weren’t particu-
larly positive, with some
members mentioning that
the term has negative
connotations and it might
be received negatively by
the student body. We dis-
cussed other names such
as Widening Participation,
Access and Participation,
Class Equality and many
more but none of these
fully resonated with the
board. Whilst it was
agreed that all these
terms are more positive
sounding, Council felt
that students wouldn’t
necessarily associate them
with the actual remit of
the officer being created.
Furthermore, there were
people in the room who
felt it was best to simply
name the officer after the
group of students being
represented, like most
other Liberation Officers.
It was felt that this
name is the most direct
“Imperial
doesn’t admit
a proportional
number of
students from
deprived
areas, and
the ones who
are here are
more likely to
drop out and
less likely to
achieve good
degrees”
4.2% higher than that of
POLAR Q1, and the rate
of students who receive
‘good degrees’ (1s or
2.1s) is approximately
4% lower in the two most
deprived quintiles of IMD
compared to the least
deprived quintile.
Imperial doesn’t admit
a proportional number of
students from deprived
areas, and the ones who
are here are more likely to
drop-out and less likely to
achieve good degrees.
This paints a somewhat
bleak picture. Imperial
doesn’t admit a propor-
tional number of students
from deprived areas, and
the ones who are here are
more likely to drop-out
and less likely to achieve
good degrees. The reasons
“Throughout
my 2.5 years
being involved
in Union
welfare, I’ve
seen that
being able to
do these roles
fully and well
is impossible
for one
person”
