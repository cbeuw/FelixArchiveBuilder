T
he Imperial
College Fashion
and Design
society is here to
kickstart 2020 with their
annual charity fashion
show next Friday. We sit
down with Simran Gill,
chemist by day and a
model next Friday night,
to learn more about the
show, titled “Billie Jean
is… Crazy in love”.
Hi Simran. Thanks
for speaking with us
today. So, let’s start
with the basics - can
you run us through
the society’s func-
tioning?
The Imperial College
Fashion and Design
society is fairly small, but
at the same time we are
quite vibrant and active
throughout the year. We
run a number of socials
each term, including
Q&As to regularly engage
with non-club members,
and we also organise visits
to various fashion exhibi-
tions around the country.
The main focus, particu-
larly around this time of
the year, is in organising
the annual fashion show.
That sounds really
interesting and fun.
Some argue that
fashion and arts are
often overlooked at
Imperial. Can you
talk about some of
the challenges the
society has faced in
making fashion part
of the discussion?
Being a university
that focuses primarily on
STEM subjects, there isn’t
a strong focus on, say, arts
and fashion. That said,
I do believe that there is
significant interest in the
student population, and
their diverse backgrounds
and unique perspective
certainly expands the
fashion and arts conversa-
tion than narrowing it. We
have strong support and
turnout for our events, and
engagement outside it.
And events like this
help the wider stu-
dent population to
engage in that con-
versation.
Yes, certainly. Plus,
it’s always fun revisiting
vogues and celebrating
them with today’s per-
spective. Like, these
events can be an amazing
opportunity to bring back
yesteryear trends and in-
corporate them in today’s
style.
Speaking of the
event. The show is
titled‘Billie Jean is...
Crazy in love’and is
pegged as a sort of
a contrast between
fashion trends of the
80s and the 00s. Can
you expand on the
theme and how it
came to be?
Yeah — it is envisaged
as a battle between the
decades 80s and the 00s
and their different fashion
styles. We contrast the
trends in different cate-
gories of clothing in these
two decades, like for
example swimwear. It is a
fashion show but more so
an entertainment show…
so the walks are designed
in a fun way and so we
have songs reflecting the
highlights from leading
artists of the decade,
Michael Jackson and
Beyoncé… that tie in well
with our primary purpose
of looking at the trends in
these two decades.
And what do you see
as the pivotal shifts
between these two
decades in terms of
fashion?
80s was hugely influ-
enced by neon colours,
leg warmers and slap
bracelets. Whereas 00s
had track suits, colourful
braids, low rise jeans
and crop tops. And we
believe there are a lot of
elements that are seeing
a comeback and we want
the event to highlight and
celebrate these… like
neon colours for example.
You can expect to see a lot
of this in the event.
I hear that we have
some dresses from
international labels
for the show?
Yes. We have dresses
from top designer houses,
who have donated clothes
to us as student models
to present them in the
fashion show.
We also hear that
there are also collab-
orative acts with the
a cappella group‘The
Imperielles’and the
dance society‘Fun-
kology’in store at the
event?
Thisisnotaconvention-
al fashion show. Although
it is to show the dresses
and the designers work,
it is an entertainment
piece as well. So, we have
amazing performances
in store, The Imperielles
are going to give a won-
derful performance and
Funkology have a highly
energetic dance designed
to keep the audience on
the edge of their seats.
Wrapping up… as
a charity show, this
year the proceedings
are to be donated to
the charity organiza-
tion ClientEarth? Can
you talk a bit about
their work and why
you chose this organ-
ization?
All the profits from the
show are going to Cli-
entEarth, an environmen-
tal law firm. Their work
is really inspiring and
highly relevant in today’s
climate. Like in 2016,
they were instrumental in
blocking the Polnoc plant,
the new largest coal power
plant in Europe. And
now they are currently
working along indigenous
people of Australia to
challenge their govern-
ments’ climate failings
at the UN. Their work is
really important and as a
club that strongly believes
in sustainable fashion, we
felt the match was perfect
and we really hope the
event is a success.
