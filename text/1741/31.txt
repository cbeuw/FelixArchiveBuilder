The Link between Animal Consumption and Global
Pandemics
H
IV, inﬂuenza,
Ebola, Spanish
ﬂu, and SARS
all share one
thing in common, and that
is that those pandemics all
originated from animals.
This feature is also shared
by the novel coronavirus
epidemic that started in
Wuhan (which is still not
considered a pandemic
yet, as the scale is not big
enough as of now).
Those diseases are
said to be zoonotic,
which is the spread of
disease between species.
This deﬁnition does not
restrict the diseases to
transmission from other
animals to humans, it can
be between any animals.
And for many zoonotic
diseases, the spread of
the disease happens to
multiple species. For
example, the Ebola virus
is thought to originate
from bats, and can infect
primates, dogs, pigs, and
humans. There are other
non-infectious zoonotic
diseases from animal
consumption such as mad
cow disease. However,
the ones that cause epi-
demics and pandemics
are infectious and once
in humans, they transmit
from human-to-human,
requiring no contact with
the original host animal.
The zoonotic disease
outbreaks in humans
are almost all thought to
originate from animal
consumption. For HIV, the
origin was the consump-
tion of bushmeat from
Chimpanzees with simian
foamy virus (Ebola also
originated from bushmeat
consumption). Bushmeat
is an important source
of food for people from
certain cultural back-
grounds, especially those
affected by poverty. The
issue is complex as even if
they were educated on the
risks of bushmeat, they
may not have a choice.
For those governments,
it is important to work
on their food system and
reduce poverty to ensure
people can access other
foods.
For countries like
China, the lack of regu-
lation of ‘wet markets’
(market selling meat,
produce, and sometimes
even live animals) has
previously caused the
SARS outbreak, and now
the coronavirus outbreak
in Wuhan. Another con-
tributing factor is cultural;
eating wild animal is
considered a symbol of
wealth because they are
rarer and more expensive.
There is also misinforma-
tion and beliefs (stemming
from traditional Chinese
medicine teachings, which
are not evidence-based)
that wild animal con-
sumption has health
beneﬁts. The markets are
also an important source
of fresh produce and often
has products cheaper than
supermarkets. The mar-
ketplace where the new
coronavirus originated
from sold is an example.
As of now, wildlife
trade has been banned in
China as of now due to
the coronavirus outbreak,
which is a win from not
only the perspective of
health, but also from the
standpoint of animal pro-
tection and conservation,
as there was no regulation
on treatment of animals,
and the source of animals
being obtained.
You may think that
any meat we consume in
the UK is risk free, but
zoonotic diseases also
come from animals we
eat in the UK. The incon-
venient truth is that those
zoonotic diseases do not
only come from bushmeat
and wild animals. Previ-
ously, swine ﬂu and bird
ﬂu have also broken out,
which are both strains
of the inﬂuenza virus.
In 1917, the Spanish
ﬂu infected 500 million
people around the world
and killed 5 percent of
the world’s population
at that time - a disease
which originated from
birds. Animal agriculture
is a deﬁnite contributing
factor for those diseases,
as the disease passes to
humans through contact
or consumption.
Furthermore, more than
half the world’s antibiotics
are used on farm animals,
which contributes hugely
to antibiotic resistance,
and is a huge threat to
global health. There
is also the very likely
eventual development of
a superbug, resistant to all
antibiotic treatments. This
may lead to very serious
and difﬁcult outbreaks in
the future.
Animal agriculture is
also a major contributor
to global warming. This
is also contributing to
disease, as mosquitos are
now able to live further
away from the equator
and spread diseases. Also,

many ancient viruses that
are frozen in the artic
ice may possibly make a
return, which can cause
new pandemics, and is
another huge threat to
global health.
The link between
animal consumption and
global health should deﬁ-
nitely be taken seriously
and higher regulation,
along with reduction in
meat consumption could
mitigate those issues.
Countries should also
learn from the lessons and
target the social determi-
nants to prevent repeating
the same mistakes.
Finally, on a slightly
different note I want to
remind people to not be
prejudiced against people
from countries of disease
outbreaks. For the Ebola
outbreak, I remember
seeing a lot of racist
content online against
black people. For the HIV
pandemic, the disease was
blamed on gay people.
Currently, there is a lot of
hatred towards Chinese
people. I want to remind
you that disease outbreaks
happen based on system-
atic problems (poverty,
culture, censorship, lack
of education), and that an-
ybody’s racism and hatred
is not justiﬁed by disease
outbreaks. Now is a good
time to lookout for one
other and acknowledge
that disease outbreaks are
something that we face
together, and that we can
all do our parts by taking
precautions.
