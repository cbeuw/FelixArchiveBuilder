The Sunset Limited
T
he Sunset
Limited is con-
ﬁned to a small,
sparse apartment
and two characters, Black
and White. This minimal-
istic setting could not be
in greater contrast to the
subject matter of this play
for it addresses the funda-
mental question that has
fascinated and frightened
people throughout histo-
ry: Is God real? Tackling
such a heavy debate is
more than daring and I
was astounded at how
masterfully it was ex-
plored, although perhaps
I should not be so quick
to doubt one of my fa-
vourite authors, Cormack
McCarthy. This play is the
debut of his work to the
London stage and it did
not disappoint.
The performance
begins mid-conversation
and from the outset, the
attitude is sombre and
intimate. The audience
discovers that the two
men are nothing more
than strangers, brought
together by a chance
encounter at the edge of a
subway platform. White,
played by Jasper Britton,
is dubbed a ‘terminal
traveller’, prevented from
taking his ﬁnal journey by
Gary Beadle’s Black. The
two now sit in Black’s
apartment and ruminate
on redemption and the
very meaning of life,
which is non-existent for
White.
The two men are
extreme opposites.
Britton’s White exudes
anxiety and defeat with
every word and action.
He nervously evades all
of Black’s questions and
physically tries to leave
the apartment countless
times throughout the per-
formance. However, he
is persistently convinced
to stay by Beadle’s
character, Black. Beadle
is inviting to both the
audience and, despite his
defences, White. He is
jovial, attentive, and kind,
despite White’s constant
rebuffs. He is also a
devout religious charac-
ter, quite different to the
ﬁrm atheist that White is
revealed to be; one could
even go as far to say
White scorns religion and
so the pair butt heads on
this topic constantly.
Due to White’s misery
and dismissiveness, the
audience does not warm
to him so readily, but
this is not to say that he
is actively disliked; he is
just adamant in his -albeit
bleak- beliefs and willing
to defend them. The same
could be said for Black,
but it manifests in a
different way. He is more
open and, in a bid to get
White talking, we learn
a lot about his conver-
sion to Christianity and
troubled past. White may
refuse to reveal anything
truly personal, but it is
still evident that he has
experienced a pain that
changed him too. In this
way, we are driven to pity
White. His pain drove him
not to religion but to the
train and it beckons him;
Just as the bible remains
on the table between the
two men throughout their
conversation, the noises
of the nearby subway are
a constant and terrible
presence.
The Sunset Limited
takes a dark look at God
through the eyes of de-
pression. Black’s humour
and brotherly affection
dull the blow, but it is
still a challenging watch.
To say I enjoyed the play
just doesn’t seem right but
that’s what I would say of
a good play; a great play
such as this is one that
gets you thinking during
the tube journey home and
in the days that follow.
