I’m (Not) Dreaming of a White... Uprising?
Actor Laurence Fox and his comments brought him both criticism and praise. Has the white-
shaming rhetoric gone too far?

T
here’s been con-
troversy about
actor Laurence
Fox’s comments
regarding race in the past
couple of weeks. It seems
that both sides of the
debate seem bitterly pas-
sionate about their stance
and Fox’s opinions have
resonated with many.
The issues surrounding
race and the formalism
in which there may be
debate has not come to a
consensus in all members
of the society; we are in
some transient period
where racial issues are
addressed but remain a
grey area. In general, the
inevitability of discourse
will lead to new ideas
replacing the old.
Fox’s media attention
started with a Question
Time programme where
he clashed with mixed
race university lecturer
Rachel Boyle who
argued that the treatment
of Meghan Markle by the
press was racism. Fox
said it’s not racism and
that Britain is “the most
tolerant, lovely country
in Europe” and that
accusations of racism
are “boring”. Boyle
hit back calling Fox a
“white privileged male”,
and Fox exclaimed that
Boyle was herself being
racist to him by saying
that.
Another incident
concerning Fox was
the comments he made
about Sam Mendes’
WWI epic, 1917. The
film portrays Sikh
soldiers who fought
along British forces,
and Fox said in James
Dellingpole’s podcast
that it “diverted” him
away from the story
and was “institutional
racism” to be forcing
diversity in the movie
industry. Fox has since
then apologised for this
comment and to the
Sikhs that he offended,
as it is a historical fact
that many Sikhs as part
of the Indian Army
fought and died in the
Great War. Fox has since
acknowledged this and
apologised.
The reaction to
Fox’s initial comments
and continued media
attention demonstrates
that he is not alone
in his views, and his
opinions certainly have
resonated with people.
That opinion being that
political correctness has
gone too far, and white
(straight male) people
are at the receiving end.
We are witnessing the
release of white frus-
tration after supposed
suppression by a leftist
society.
The story so far: the
white guilt narrative
entered the social con-
science and had by-prod-
ucts like fashionable
white supremacy and
extremism which have
been brewing under the
surface. Progressive and
left ideas aren’t readily
challenged by those
workplace, the media,
and culture. This shift in
power and media atten-
tion is causing unrest,
as traditional ideals and
norms are brought to
scrutiny with no time to
react. With the internet
facilitating more ex-
tremism and amplifying
like-minded views on all
sides, it traps people in
perpetuating confirma-
tion bias on all sides of
the spectrum, arguably
a consequence of liber-
alism. Fox represents
this—outspoken and
unafraid of seemingly
controversial comments,
and the support he has
had is evidence that
these are the kinds of
incidents we will see
as a reaction to the
movement. I expect an
uprising against white
‘repression’.
Unless we can talk
about race and racism in
a manner that everyone
can agree on, any
progress is impossible.
The two strains of
thought cannot exist
harmoniously in unison,
and thus can only induce
further conflict. After a
very eggshell laden path
towards our modern atti-
tudes of race and related
topics of debate in which
many people are con-
flicted, we will see more
instances of outspoken
opposition against the
norm. Laurence Fox is
not alone in this opinion
that white people are
unjustly villainised in
the mainstream narra-
tive. White rage will
confront and there will
be consequences.

“The
demonization
of traditional
masculine
values with
no given
alternative
leads to
resentment”
who oppose them, as
society is still unsure of
the implications of race
and how to deal with the
notion of systematic in-
stitutional racism. This
has led to outspoken
people who are outraged
at the progressive atti-
tudes and “snowflakes”
who are sensitive about
political correctness.
The non-PC voices
unafraid and unadulter-
ated by the pressures to
conform are singled out
and emphasised, where
Fox’s comments were
labelled “refreshing”
by many. Thus, begins
a white renaissance, not
conforming to the white
guilt rhetoric. Straight
white men feel under
attack for who they are,
and it’s not like they’re
going to take the back
seat on this. The demo-
nization of traditional
masculine values with no
given alternative leads
to resentment towards
those who only criticise.
Due to the changing
tides in the world, many
are disillusioned further,
leading to the incubation
of dangerous ideas on
all sides.
The world has become
a more inclusive place
very quickly—within a
generation, the attitudes
that have changed are
immense, from race, to
sex and sexuality, and
other minorities in the
“We are
witnessing
the release
of white
frustration”
