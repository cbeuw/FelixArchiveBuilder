John James Humm
Fashion Writer
Can you briefly in-
troduce yourself and
your brand?
Hello! I’m Juliana,
owner and creator of
Juliana Russell Designs.
Originally from Boston,
I studied abroad here at
the London College of
Fashion in 2018, which
made me absolutely fall
in love with the city of
London and all of the
people, fashion, culture
and art that comes with it.
I loved it so much I made
it my mission to work here
after graduating – and I
couldn’t be happier with
that decision (hello five
year visa!). My designs
are one of a kind, made
to stand out in whatever
crowd you’re in.
Where does your in-
spiration come from
and what is your
brands ethos?
For my collection
Sensory Stimulation,
my inspirations come
from a number of things,
one being expressing
texture through different
fabrics and techniques,
and how these factors
can affect the way you
look, feel and think about
clothes. My obsession
for unicorns and their
magical presence has also
definitely inspired many
aspects for this collection,
as you will soon see, this
collection is like entering
a dreamy, magical world
filled with bright colours
and sparkles.
How does London
and its culture influ-
ence you?
London’s crazy fashion
and quirky art had a huge
impact on my designs.
Nobody is afraid to stand
out here, everyone likes
expressing themselves
in unique and fun ways.
This city truly pushes my
creative boundaries and
I’m not afraid to branch
out from the norm when it
comes to my designs.
How do you feel your
designs connect to a
student population?
As I finished my degree
in Boston only a few
years ago, I completely
understand the grind that
we as designers, espe-
cially student designers,
go through. The sleepless
nights of sewing and seam
ripping, and the criticism
of others who just don’t
understand how much
time and hard work goes
into creating something
that truly makes you
happy. What I can tell you
is that the countless hours
in the studio are complete-
ly worth it, so don’t give
up, you’ll be outshining
the haters soon enough.
Why did you decide
to participate in the
Imperial College
2020 Fashion Show?
The fact that the show
is a charity event for Cli-
entEarth was an automatic
yes for me. As I have an
upcoming collection for
2021 in the making, I
wanted to present Sensory
Stimulation one final time,
and why not end it with a
on a high note?
The fashion show’s
theme and format
this year takes the
form of“1980s Vs.
2000s”. How do you
feel about the styles
and fashion in these
decades and is it
reflected in your de-
signs?
Glitter, glitz, glam.
These decades shaped
the way for a new era of
fashion, and we’re 100%
still seeing these trends
return on today’s runways.
Besides being extra and
sparkly, I also brought the
bell-bottomed trousers
back with a special twist.
Which‘fashion icons’
from the 1980s or the
2000s do you wish
you could see in your
garments?
Whitney Houston,
Leigh Bowery, Madonna,
Michael Jackson, Abba,
and Christina Aguilera
to name some. I could
definitely see them per-
forming in my stuff.
Looking forward to
the 2020s, where do
you see your career
going?
With my new collection
in the pre-development
stages, I’m excited to
launch it by 2021, follow-
ing with runway shows
and editorial photoshoots.
However, this collection
will be with a different
twist from what you’re
seeing at this year’s show.
Don’t worry, they’ll still
be a lot of glitz and glam,
just in a more sophisticat-
ed way with a different
colour scheme. I hope to
join a brand in the near
future with like-minded
style and ethos so I can
contribute to their team’s
designs and create some
really innovative content.
Our charity this year
is ClientEarth, Eu-
rope’s pioneering
environmental law
charity which helps
to minimise the
impacts of climate
change. Is this an is-
sue that you’ve been
mindful of in your
work?
There are a few tech-
niques and fabrics in my
collection Sensory Stimu-
lation that are reused from
my previous fabric stock
that I’ve collected over
the years. However, my
upcoming collection for
2021 will be much more
sustainable with minimal
fabric waste in mind, as I
have grown over the past
few years and I want to
become better and design
smarter when it comes to
reusing textiles and giving
them a new life.Work with
what you have! In fact,
my finale piece this show
was created entirely out of
fabric swatches from my
office’s fabric library that
we were getting rid of.
What are your
thoughts and feel-
ings on the current
relationship between
the fashion industry
and the environ-
ment?
I’m so glad that over
the past few years the
fashion industry has really
accepted the damage
we’ve done to the Earth.
We’ve addressed that we
are one of the most pollut-
ing industries, but thank-
fully SO many brands are
now on board with ethical
sourcing, sustainable pro-
duction, and the circular
economy of a garment.
We are aware of the
issues, and we are trying
to become better, which
is a start. Some people see
sustainability as a “trend”,
but it’s not, it’s a new way
of living. I believe it will
continue to grow even
larger over time, expand-
ing to all industries over
the world, becoming an
absolute standard for all
businesses.
Where can our read-
ers find you on social
media and buy your
garments from? If
you are sold in any
physical retail loca-
tions in London, tell
us where!
