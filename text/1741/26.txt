New Video Game Releases in February 2020: Dreams,
Starting this month, we here at Felix Games are going
to be updating you with the best upcoming releases of
the month. February is looking to be a relatively slow
month, lacking in hard hitters, but there are some gems
coming out that are sure to hold any type of gamer over
until the big AAA titles of the year start to show up.

“If you’re a fan
of the genre,
or simply love
Darksiders -
you should
pick it up in a
heartbeat”
Dreams
M
y most
anticipated
game of
February is
the long-awaited Dreams.
This is an exclusive for
the PS4 that is finally
hitting shelves on 14th
February, the perfect
Valentine’s gift for your
gamer bae. Dreams looks
to be an extraordinary,
endless game universe,
where you can discover
community-made games
from around the world,
as well as being able to
create your own! It is
coming from one of my
favourite, award winning
studios: Media Molecule
– creators of Little Big
Planet, a game which took
the world by storm back
in the PS3 days.
Adding to the list
of games by the studio
with a focus on creation,
Dreams looks to evolve
what it means to show
creativity within a game.
With countless, easy to
use tools at your disposal,
Dreams looks to allow
anyone to share their ideas
with a global community
full of innovators.
Whether you want
to create games, music,
paintings, animation,
sculpture, movies or
simply just play, Dreams
is the perfect game to
express yourself – with
endless replayability, it
is sure to be worth the
£34.99 price tag.
Snack World: The
Dungeon Crawl Gold
Also coming out on
Valentine’s Day, Snack
World: The Dungeon
Crawl Gold is a charming,
whacky RPG by the
creators of Professor
Layton and Fantasy Life.
Being a port of a Japanese
game, we already know
what to expect from this
Nintendo Switch exclu-
sive. After your village
is invaded, you become
a heroic adventurer and
seek revenge against the
villainous Sultan Vinegar.
You can play alone, or
team up with up to 3
players in local or online
multiplayer to crawl
throughahostofrandomly
generated dungeons. The
“Gold” part of the title
means that it is releasing
with all the DLC from
the Japanese game at no
extra cost. While it does
seem a bit too ludicrous
for some players, the very
meta fourth wall breaking
and combination of high
fantasy with high tech
look to make an interest-
ing title.
Darksiders Genesis
Yet another game
being released on the
14th, Darksiders Genesis
is a spin-off Darksiders
title for all major home
consoles. Having already
been released on PC late
last year, we have a pretty
goodideaofwhattoexpect
from it – with a respecta-
ble 77% on Metacritic. It
is a top-down, hack and
slash, action, roleplaying
game… in short: it’s like
Diablo. Despite a growing
abundance of these Diab-
lo-type games in recent
years on the Switch, Dark-
siders Genesis looks to
quench the thirst of Sony
and Microsoft lovers in
need of a top-down hack
and slash game. This is a
must play for any fan of
the Darksiders lore, taking
place before any of the
main games and exploring
the origin of the Seven
Seals. Another aspect
which is surely a staple
in games of this manor
nowadays is the ability to
play fully in Co-op, yes
please! Unfortunately,
it does not seem to do
anything new with the
genre, so if you are unsure
about getting it, I would
give it a miss. On the other
hand, if you’re a fan of
the genre, or simply love
Darksiders – you should
pick it up in a heartbeat.
One Punch Man: A
Hero Nobody Knows
Just like the title, it
seems that not that many
people know this game
is coming out! Releasing
on the 27th February on
PS4, Xbox One and PC,
One Punch Man: A Hero
Nobody Knows is an
upcoming fighting game
by Bandai Namco. It
seems very different to the
typical 3D fighting game.
With combat that reminds
me of Tekken, you play
as any one of a group
of eclectic characters,
fighting one of the many
enemies of the One Punch
Man universe. However,
the aim isn’t necessarily
to win the battle, but
instead just survive until
Saitama (One Punch
Man) shows up so that
he can deliver the final
blow in a single punch!
Think along the lines of
a tactical nuke from COD
MW2… those were the
days. It is an interesting
concept, but I fear the
idea may quickly become
stale. I’m probably going
to pick it up, though once
it is discounted. If you’re
a fan of the anime, or the
manga, I see no harm in
grabbing it… other than
to your wallet. £50 seems
pricey for such a game,
ouch.
The Dark Crystal: Age
of Resistance Tactics
The Dark Crystal: Age
of Resistance Tactics,
based off the Netflix
show of the same name
(minus the tactics bit) is
a turn-based tactics game,
similar to the likes of Final
Fantasy Tactics, with a 3D
environment to interact
with and a whole host of
environmental objects at
your disposal. It’s coming
out on pretty much
everything on February
4th. I can’t say I am that
excited as I haven’t seen
the show, nor do I enjoy
tactics games all too
much. But I am sure this
fits the niche of many a
player out there. It comes
with around 50 battles, a
Dreams is finally launching after years of teasers! // Media Molecule/Sony
