Dear Sir
In F E L I X 606 you printed
a one page advert for Barclays
Bank. S u r e l y it is w r o n g ,
especially for a Union publi-
cation, to publicise or take
m o n e y f r o m a c o m p a n y
which is so closely linked to
the South African apartheid
system.
Barclays benefits greatly
from its South African links,
and forms a significant part oi
t h a t c o u n t r i e s e c o n o m y .
Barclays is the largest bank in
South Africa, with over 1,000
branches in South Africa and
Namibia. The South African
subsidiary, Barclays National,
is 60% owned by Barclays in
Britain, and has over _£500m
invested in government bonds
a n d p u b l i c s e c u r i t i e s — a
direct investment in the state,
supporting and profiting from
this evil regime.
Amongst Barclays contri-
butions to the country's war
effort the most blatant was its
purchase of £6.6m of "de-
fence" bombs, helping finance
the armed forces.
Barclays also contravenes
U N rulings by operating in
N a m i b i a (illegally occupied
by South Africa).
The South African regime
depends heavily on foreign
investment, both to oppress
a n d exploit the 80% n o n -
white section of its population,
and to finance its frequent
i n v a s i o n s of n e i g h b o u r i n g
countries. In 1980, Barclays
participated in a $250m loan
to South Africa.
Barclays has already lost
several million pounds worth
of accounts as a result of the
campaign to boycott Barclays.
There are two reasons for not
banking with Barclays. The
first is on principle—I cer-
tainly wouldn't want any of
my money to be lent to .South
Africa. The second is to put
economic pressure on Barclays
to end its links with racism
and oppression. I hope any
actual or potential holders of
Barclays accounts will bear
this in mind.

Dear Sir
Have we got our priorities
w r o n g ? T h e S u p p l i e s to
Poland scheme, while good in
theory, seems pointless when
all the factors are considered.
1. If the Poles were starving
the rest of the socialist states
would surely help them out,
rather than running the risk
of r e v o l u t i o n i n P o l a n d
against the communist system.
T h e S o v i e t s m u s t be i n
hysterics over the way we are
giving away food to prop up a
decaying regime. If we want
to help them, why not give
them the means to grasp their
freedom? A n airlift of arma-
ments to Gdansk for example.
2. What about Afghanis-
tan? Have we forgotten about
the Russian invasion and the
thousands of dead Afghans?
Back in 1979 we made a lot of
noise about sanctions a n d
very nearly missed the great
propaganda victory made by
Coe and Ovett at the 1980
Olympics (the most politically
orientated since 1936). A t
least helicopter gunships and
napalm are not being used in
Poland. The average Pole is
h a v i n g it easy. T h e most
helpful thing we could do for
the A f g h a n s w o u l d be to
supply them with ground-to-
air missiles. This would also
relieve the pressure on Poland,
because the Soviets would-
have to use more of their
infantry in Afghanistan, once
their helicopters became less
effective.
These proposals may seem
extreme, but often the justifi-
cation of the overthrow of a
regime by arms is only ac-
cepted afterwards when all
the facts are known. Was it
wrong to overthrow PolPot,
Idi A m i n and Hitler?

T h e y ' r e at it a g a i n i n
Canada!
Baby seals are being killed
for their pelts.
Sometimes they are skinned
while still conscious to save
the time and effort of killing
them first. C a n you imagine
the a g o n y t h e y m u s t go
through?
Between M a r c h 8 and 12
the European Parliament is
voting on whether to ban the
import of all skins and pro-
ducts derived from cruelty.
Please write to your Euro

favour of the ban.

Dear Mark
I was indeed puzzled by-the
l e t t e r f r o m " P u z z l e d of
F a l m o u t h / K e o g h " . I read in
my N M E this week that Elton
John has rearranged for the
coming autumn a London
c o n c e r t he was forced to
cancel last spring. When one
c o n s i d e r s t h a t the C h e f s
(just one of the bands featured
at L i n k s C a r n i v a l ) h a v e
played six London gigs in the
last three months, one can
only assume that if the writer
finds such music "unfamiliar"
it is because he is a lazy
mindless cretin, too idle to get
off his fat arse and go and see
some of the excellent bands
currently gigging in London.

Dear Mark
Last year, Barney M c C a b e
was the person in R C S in
charge of mascotry (see the
article in the last Broadsheet by
Paul Johnson). This year, as a
sabbatical officer of I C U , he is
supposed to treat all sections
of College equally.
Yet, only the other week,
he was displayed on the front
c o v e r o f F E L I X ( w i t h
M a r c o L e d w o l d , a n o t h e r
I C U s a b b a t i c a l ) h o l d i n g
Spanner and Bolt. Last week,
he was responsible for leaving
Reggie (the King's College
m a s c o t ) i n the G r a f f i t t i
storeroom, whence G u i l d s
l a t e r ' l i b e r a t e d ' i t . T h e s e
mascots were stolen by R C S ,
not I C U , and should be of no
concern to him, leastways not
in public and certainly not on
the cover of F E L I X . T h e
'Reggie incident' also shows a
blatant abuse of position, in
that he alone has the master
keys to all the Union rooms
and as such has access to them
all.
Come on M c C a b e , play the
w h i t e m a n . G e t on w i t h
looking after the interests of
I C U (a job you were elected
to) and not the mascots of
R C S (a job you do very badly
if last F r i d a y ' s debacle is
anything to go by).
