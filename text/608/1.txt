in Morton?
An emergency motion of no confidence in the executive
overshadowed the husting speeches at yesterday's UGM.

Mary captured by RCS
The Royal College of Science Union violated Mary, the
mascot of Queen Mary College London, on Tuesday.
A group of around 20 students met in the R C S U Office at 6:30am
and reached Queen M a r y College around 8:15am.
They found the yellow and brown leopard bolted to the iloor. but as
the nuts were only Finger tight the mascot was easily removed. They
also managed to overcome the attention of a security guard who put a
neck-lock on one of the mascotry team before he was persuaded to
accept a letter to the President of Queen M a r y College.

Although the elections for next year's R C S U Officers were inquorate,
it was ratified by a Results U G M last Tuesday.
The next R C S U President will be M r K a r l Schmidt and the other
executive members will be Miss Fiona O w e n (Vice-President) and M r
Charles Fuller (Honorary Secretary). Miss Hazel Cheeseborough and
M r Bruce Bricknell will be Academic Affairs Officer and Honorary
Junior Treasurer respectively.
The meeting opened at 1:07pm with a large crowd present in the
Great H a l l . M i k e , the U n i o n mascot, was also present.
The motion was put forward during the President's business and the
meeting decided that it should be heard immediately. It was proposed
by Philip Nathan and after he had received several extensions, M r
Nick M o r t o n opposed the motion. M r M o r t o n then moved to the
centre of the hall and nearly brought the hall down with a rousing
speech. The motion of no confidence was heavily defeated.
Other reports were accepted without complication. M r R o n a n
M c D o n a l d , R a g Chairman, explained that there would be a R a g stunt
t o d a y w h i l e H a n d b o o k E d i t o r M r P e t e r R o d g e r s a s k e d f o r
contributions before Friday, A p r i l 30.
The hustings themselves were uneventful with a long series of
important, yet uninteresting and repetitive questions being asked to all
ten candidates.
T h e q u o r u m was successfully challenged at 3:15pm after a n
argument between President and Deputy President about whether the
meeting should be adjourned or was inquorate.
This meant that a motion on South Africa was not put and no one
had the opportunity to put the case for abstaining in the sabbatical
elections.
Bolt snapped!
The new system of electronic bolts recently installed in the
basement of the Southside Halls of Residence was vandalised
on Wednesday evening, only half an hour after being used for
the first time.
Fhe bolts are part of an improved security system which is intended
to isolate the bar area and prevent unauthorised entry to Southside.
Access to the bar will in future be from the side door directly above it
only. This means that the main .Southside doors will be kept shut and
only residents should be able to gain access to the Halls through the
entrance by the lifts.
T h e electronic bolts were shut l o r the first time at 7:00pm
Wednesday, but somebody gained access to the R e a l A l e Bar,
presumably via a back entrance which then slammed shut. Finding
tliemsell(ves) locked in, a handle was torn from one door and another
door charged (with considerable force) until the bolt housing snapped.
Replacing the bolt will be very expensive and anyone who can offer
information on the incident should contact the College Security Officer
or the Union President.
