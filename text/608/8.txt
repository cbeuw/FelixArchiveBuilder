Deputy President: GERARD LIVETT proposed by William Waterson
O v e r t h e p a s t y e a r s , we h a v e s e e n a
succession of sabbatical Union Officers who
seem barely capable of doing the job.
Part of the problem as I can see it is that the
candidates who get themselves elected have
become so intwined with the Union heirarchy
that they lose touch with the reality of life on
campus.
It will be my intention as Deputy President
to inject a new and youthful vitality to the
Union.
P e o p l e will ask me the m o s t o b v i o u s
question: "What experience have you had in
Union affairs so far?"
During the course of last term, 1 was elected
a member of the Entertainments Committee.
Most of my sparetime is now spent helping
with events that the entertainments committee
organise.
With respect to my entertaining committ-
ments students ask me: " W h y doesn't the Ents
C o m m i t t e e stage any big concerts?" The
answer to this is quite simple. We (the Ents
Committee) do not receive a large enough
grant from the Union. This is one thing I am
campaigning for, a larger Ents grant. I would
also improve the facilities in the Union, such as
the toilets, the kitchens, etc.
Student welfare is another branch of my
conce(a)rn. It would be my duty to encourage
more students to become aware of what is
available to them. I would also vehemently
oppose any infringement of student liberty and
of their living standards, such as mid-session
rent increases.
For more details see me at the hustings.
Lots of love from,

Hon."Secretary: NIGEL CRYER proposed by Karl Schmidt
I've known Nigel since I've been at Imperial.
He's friendly, approachable and well organised
— all the qualities necessary for I C U H o n Sec.
He's well acquainted with the committees and
system of the Union and thus knows a lot
about the job already. A s a consequence, he
realises the responsibilities which you shall
bestow upon him by voting for him as I C U
Hon Sec. He is the man to do the job and do it
properly. So, for a well organised Union next
year, vote Nigel Cryer for I C U H o n Sec.
Karl Schmidt
I see the job of H o n Sec in two ways; firstly as
an administrative post and secondly as a
representative of students. I will take the
administrative responsibilities seriously since,
if the Union does not run smoothly, then it
cannot hope to effectively represent the
students on important issues.
I want to see a new role for the Hon Sec — it
has been all too easy for him to remain in the
background but now, with education cuts, we
are being exploited more than ever and the
Hon Sec must come out from the shadows and
actively join in the opposition. Some cuts are
unavoidable but when they are obviously
unreasonable, we must unite to fight them.
In addition to cuts, there are several other
areas which I feel require improvement —
attendance at U G M s needs to be increased to
make them more representative and, with the
possibility of a blind student in Maths next
year, the facilities for such cases in College
needs to be investigated.
I have the experience and enthusiasm to do
the job of H o n Sec well so use your vote wisely
and vote for me — by doing so, you are voting
for an influential and well run Union.
Hon. Secretary: MARY FREEMAN proposed by Frank Rowsell
In my three years at Imperial College I have
watched my contemporaries become more
and more remote and isolated from I C U , initial
interest and enthusiasm becoming dampened
down.
I am campaigning on Mary's behalf because I
am convinced her election will be a significant,
as well as pleasant, change for the Union. She
is a candidate who is amply capable of inspiring
and motivating other people; hard work is no
s t r a n g e r to her a n d she is a n effective
organiser w h o is able to tackle problems
without fuss. More importantly she is a good
listener.
I urge you to give her the chance to show
you this too.
Frank Rowsell
T o be h o n e s t , m y ' h a c k ' c r e d i b i l i t y is
absolutely zero. I have not sat on any of the
f o l l o w i n g c o m m i t t e e s : C o u n c i l , E x t e r n a l
A f f a i r s , E n t s , T U C , C B I , N a t i o n a l F r o n t
Overseas committee. So, if you have never
been on any of these either I am the obvious
candidate for you.
However, I am a serious candidate for this
post, and as H o n Sec my priorities would be
—to carry out all the administrative duties an
Hon Sec is required to do.
—to function as an active member of the Exec
in the political field.
—to thoroughly organise all the paperwork
and minimize the humph (wherever possible).
—to investigate methods of improving the
refectories' service (e.g. requesting that large
displays, giving the opening times and a price
list, be set up; investigating the reasons for the
extortionate food prices).
1 regard a sabbatical post as a full-time job,
and not a 'year off, but I realise that it is not a
straight 9 till 5 job, which means that I am
prepared to devote as m u c h time as is
necessary to do the Hon See's job — and to do
it well.
