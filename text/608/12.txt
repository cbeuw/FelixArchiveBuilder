(^Swimming
Still smarting from last week's defeat at the
h a n d s o f B r i s t o l , I C t o o k o n O x f o r d
University in our own pool. W i t h the Varsity
S w i m m i n g & Water Polo match due next
weekend, they were keen to do "spillingly
well, what-hor"' Consequently we were up
against it again. W e destroyed their women's
team, i.e. they were too afraid of our women
(Francoise, etc.) to turn up.
T h e m e n d i d n ' t d o q u i t e so w e l l .
Organisation and preparation ol the I C team
were ol the usual high standard and rumours
that some of the team were drunk and/or got
up late a r e t o t a l l y w i t h o u t f o u n d a t i o n .
Oxford were faster and litter (not difficult!)
than we were, and our only winner was J i m
Boucher in the breastroke, alter a closely
fought race with one of the Oxford machines.
T e a m : J. Campbell, 1. Wilier, A. Kenrick,
II'. Moore', F. Lye, M. fuck, . V. Last, R. Leach,

T h e L o n d o n U n i v e r s i t y T e a m J u d o
Tournament was held for the first time for
three years, we won last time.
In the first round we drew Brunei, a very
strong team and also the ref was going senile
so although we put up a very good fight we
were unable to win more than two contests
therefore we were knocked out.
There was also a repercharge operating so
Brunei carried us through (in the end they
won the gold) and we fought Multicolleges
and showed them a thing or two. W e won
3-1 with a bye making it 4-1.
This took us into the runners up round and
meant we were fighting Q M C for a medal.
This looked as i f it was going to be a task
because our heaviest player was lighter than
their lightest but we muddled through and so
came away with a medal.

Seconds
O u t of the land o f the N o r t h came the I C
Second cohort under centurion Stroomus.
They marched reinforced by a group of
senators Forbus, Lilus and Eldrigian to clear
the colony Chiswick of the Etessan natives.
T h e power a n d tactics of the well-drilled
battalion showed immediately despite the
sticky, recently cultivated battlefield. M a n y
powerful thrusts on the right flank eventually-
led to a gaol by Forbus, assisted well by
Eldrigian who played throughout with the
speed of a seige engine and the skill of a
battering ram. T h e second goal followed
good work on the right flank by Farmus and
was scored by W y l i a n , a wild tribesman from
the f r o z e n l a n d f a r N o r t h . I n d i v i d u a l
skirmishes broke out between the armies,
involving Sharpus and Forbus. Meanwhile
W y l i a n had added to his second goal and
F'armus scored just on full-time. The defense
of B u t l e r u s , R o e s s i n k u s , P i t h k e t l u s a n d
Sharpus played very well but undoubtedly
the full praise of the empire goes to Jonus
w h o s h a l l b e t o a s t e d b y t h e l e g i o n s
throughout the world for his performance
that day.
T e a m : Butlerus, Roessinkus, Jonus, Pithketlus,
Sharpus, Stroomus, Forbus, Lilus, Farmus,
Wylian, Eldrigian, Birdus.
Ladies
T o our surprise at 1:00 we found we had a
grand total of five players!!! Despite being
confident of success with this number we
a g r e e d t h a t h a v i n g s e v e n w o u l d n o t
give t h e S c h o o l o f P h a r m a c y p l a y e r s
s u c h a n i n I e r i o r i t y c o m p l e x , w h e n
they lost. F o r t u n a t e l y we were able to
d r a g a n o t h e r p l a y e r from b e d since the
umpire knew of her whereabouts. Chris(tina)
also readily agreed to play if we provided him
with a skirt.
After only five minutes of play we were 1 -0
behind due to Chris(tina) being overcome by
the opposition.
Halftime oranges (what d i d you put i n
them Caroline?) a n d o u r captain's usual
inspiring team talk soon resulted in three
goals i n less than five minutes to which
another one was later added to bring the
total to four.
Chris(tina) had a particularly good game,
the S O P team members seeming to enjoy his
physical contact! Caroline's good humou:
( w o n d e r w h y ? ) a n d C h r i s ( t i n a ) ' s legs
contributed to an enjoyable game. A l l goals
were scored by Alison, but Alison didn't score
a hattrick. Thanks to Barry for umpiring.
T e a m : Alison, Alison, Alison, Caroline, Ruth,
Karen, Chris.
Rifle & Pistol
As promised last week, the club outing to
Bisley took place o n Sunday, the aim of the
trip was to introduce novices to the subtle art
of full bore rifle s h o o t i n g . D e n i s S l e a t h
( C l u b C a p t a i n , contact v i a the M e c h E n g
letter-racks) took advantage of this trip by
making his presence felt by all, but this did
not improve his shooting however, which
showed little overall improvement.
Some members, notably Steve Harrison,
were s l i g h t l y u n s e t t l e d b y t h e v i o l e n t
activities of the drivers, who were attempting
to take the shortest route possible through 'S'
bends i n the country lanes.
It is hoped that some 'elite' members (those
who shoot for the Llniversity of London!) will
be able to shoot in the i n t e r - C C U competition
in two weeks time, again at Bisley over a
range of 900 yards.
Whilst not participating in the Bisley trip,
the skills of new members Denk-al-Salam
were evident as he pulled out a '96' after
dropping 3 on the first shot.
