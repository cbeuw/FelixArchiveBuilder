Supplies to Poland
Further details
In the last week encouraging impetus has been gained by the 'Supplies to
Poland' group's project which involves the transport and distribution in
Poland, of 200 tonnes (ten lorries worth!) of food, clothing and medical
supplies which should ease the hardship of at least some of those that are
suffering as a result of the shortages caused by the recent crisis. In
particular, special baby foods and the supplies in many hospitals are
dangerously low. The crew comprising of about fifteen Imperial College
students is now virtually complete and will be meeting with any other
helpers every Tuesday and Friday at 12:45pm in the Union Upper Dining
Hall.
The preferred plan for the project was originally conceived outside the
College and is both ambitious and highly original. N o w the challenge is
being met by a group made up solely of Imperial College students and
staff run by Malcolm Clarke, a n electrical engineering postgraduate.
Hoping to go this coming vacation, it is planned to ship the supplies on the
Elbe from Hamburg to Prague on a single 200t barge whose owner can
hopefully be persuaded to come and pick up the cargo in London.
Normally barges travel empty in this direction and should therefore be
available quite cheaply. In Prague where we have contacts in the
Technical University the supplies will be divided into ten Czech lorries.
Each lorry will be accompanied by some Imperial College students to the
destinations for the supplies designated by the Church and the State in
Poland. At present such supplies are being distributed through either
Church or State networks, but in this way we hope in some way to keep a
check on whether the supplies arriving from the West are actually
reaching those who really require the assistance. If successful such a
venture will not only help the Polish people but also allay doubts in Britain
about the final outcome of such donations once in Polish hands and
hence possibly encourage more aid in the future.
We are working o n the project with an established charity, the
Ockenden Venture, which will be organising the collection of the supplies
in Britain. However we still need funds and donations of supplies and
therefore we apnea! to anybody who has contacts with a firm or knows of
a firm who may be interested in our scheme to contact Malcolm Clarke
through the Union Office letter-racks. Y o u could even contact them on
our behalf. Similarly any helpful comments and ideas and any alternatives
to the scheme will be gratefully appreciated.
Loughborough race home
Hyde Park suffered an invasion on Saturday afternoon as 700 runners
sought to complete their laps in Imperial College's 34th annual H y d e
Park Relay. Sebastian Coe's failure to appear disappointed some, but
the event was still graced by a number of international stars and teams
from as far away as Sweden. Coe's absence did not stop Loughborough
University retaining the title, while the Ladies' Race attracted a record
number of entries.
At the prize-giving, D r T o n y Watts recounted how the event had
been started with 9 teams in 1949. The event was sponsored by
National Westminster Bank who have now sponsored it for a number
of years. Results on page 13.
The start of the men's race.
Priest at IC
Last week, Chris Priest, probably
the best British science fiction
w r i t e r a l i v e , c a m e to talk to
I C S F S . His wife, Lisa Tuttle, an
A m e r i c a n S F w r i t e r w h o s e
collaboration Wmdhuven is n o w
a v a i l a b l e t h r o u g h N E L , also
came.
Chris talked about what and
why Science Fiction is, postu-
l a t i n g that w e a r e t h e first
century to consider long-term
change, and that thus SF" was a
product of our society.

'Teach In'

The Ministry of Disinformation: various positions adopted by
British government on the issue of nuclear war.
The Protest against the present phase of the
nuclear arms escalation has made such an
impact over the last few years that few people
can have remained totally agnostic o n these
matters. In the near future the controversy can
only intensify as T r i d e n t b e c o m e s more
expensive and as the government attempts to
site Cruise missiles here. Unfortunately, all this
has not usually been a c c o m p a n i e d by a n
increase in knowledge and understanding of
the underlying issues. M P s are themselves
ignorant, as was demonstrated by the low
level of debate during the first parliamentary
discussion of Nuclear Arms policy for 15 years
in M a r c h 1980.
^ T h i s S a t u r d a y , M a r c h 6, t h e r e is a n
opportunity for people to discuss and learn
more about the vitally important issues. In
cooperation with a local C N D and World
D i s a r m a m e n t C a m p a i g n ( W D C ) g r o u p ,
I C C N D has organised an all-day 'Teach In'. In
the m o r n i n g there will be four talks by
distinguished speakers. Then, in the afternoon
participants choose one of six workshops
where they will discuss and analyse one area in
depth. The role play workshop would allow
you to relive and analyse those arguments that
you wish you had fared better in.
For the last hour everyone meets together
again for a talk about what has been resolved
and what this means for the future.
Things are moving fast. The Women's Peace
Camps outside the proposed Cruise missile
bases need support and publicity. The U N
Second Session o n Disarmament in June is
becoming an important focus of attention as
we discover that Reagan and Thatcher do not
intend to participate. There is a lot to be done
and choices will have to be made. W e hope
that the T e a c h - i n t o m o r r o w will p r e p a r e
people to make them wisely.
