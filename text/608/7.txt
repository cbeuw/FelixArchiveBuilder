The Experience
I C U Externa] Affairs Officer 1978/9*
Editor of Sennet (now L o n d o n S t u d e n t )
1979/80*

tee 1980/1*
R S M U Newsletter Editor 1979/80
I sat on the Metallurgy dept staff/student
committee for two years
*I am lying about these.
The Bullshit
Basically I am standing for the job of I C U
President because I fancy a year off from my
studies. It must be great to get a grant and a
free room and do bugger all for it. It is obvious
that most of you haven't the nous to work this
out so you might as well vote for me. It is
Y O U R union so Y O U must decide whether
you want one of the self-serving prats who are
standing against me as your President or self-
serving me — at least I'm honest about it and
am not a prat.
The Policies
I will fight to make sure that my mates are
alright as regards piss-ups, parking permits,
etc. I feel that I would be able to work well with
the other sabbaticals; the people who are
standing are fairly random and so I should be
able to dump all my work on them leaving me
to get on with the real presidents job: getting
pissed, gatecrashing parties and attending
sundry other hoolies.
For a long time we have had Presidents who
have been elected on certain policies and then
done piss all about them. If you look at all the
candidates and all their promises I am sure you
will agree with me that there is only one
choice: A B S T A I N .
Dep. President: PHILIP GREENSTREET proposed by Crispin Dobson
Why do I think that I would make a good DP?
Well, I feel that I could deal well with all the
aspects of the post. I have a broad experience
of running and sitting on committees, for as
Vice President of R C S I have sat on Finance
Committee, and handled estimates. I have a
g o o d w o r k i n g k n o w l e d g e of the U n i o n
Building, and am well acquainted with the lock
system employed within College.
But there should be more to being D P than
just going through the work. Y o u should be
capable and confident enough to deputise for
the President when the need arises, able to
raise interest in the Union amongst students,
and able to communicate with those around
you.
In their campaigns, various people will tell
you how wonderfully militant they intend to be.
This is a ridiculous attitude to take. I don't
intend to be pushed around by College or the
extremes of student opinion, but if action is
needed I will take it.
I intend to take ' M i k e ' to every U n i o n
Meeting, and hopefully one or two other items
as well.
Most of all, I want to know what the average
student wants of the Union, and I shall do my
utmost to find out.
If Simon Shaw's motion to make Deputy
President in charge of IC Ents is passed, thus
m a k i n g E n t s O f f i c e r a s a b b a t i c a l , I a m
confident that I can carry the post.
I may not be the best man for the job, but
I'm the best on offer.

Deputy President: JOHN WHITE proposed by Alan Edwards
Firstly, if elected I would have to strive for a
good working relationship with those people
around me. especially the President, and H o n
Sec. A n uncoordinated Exec would be of little
use to anyone. Together with this and from my
experiences this year, I have found that one of
the most important, and essential functions of
the Deputy President is to be in the Union
areas for a large amount of time — not only
during the daytime. Thus he would be more
i n f o r m e d about the U n i o n f i x t u r e s a n d
generally more likely to be able to deal quickly
with any problem which may arise. I propose
to do this, having spent a lot of time in the
Union Building to date.
I also propose to help the executives of each
club and society with the promotion of their
activities, as after all, this is the only contact
most students have with the Union. This will
involve taking a close interest in all the major
subcommittees, and especially the financial
affairs of clubs — through the subcommittees.
The Deputy President is responsible for the
security of the Union areas, and the safety of
those within it. I consider the security of the
Union Building especially, to be poor. A closer
check will have to be kept on the whereabouts
of keys, and possibly restricting the areas in
w h i c h people may m o v e , especially non-
students using the Union facilities.
John White
