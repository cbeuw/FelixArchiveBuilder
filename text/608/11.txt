Grants Cut Action Week
Don't forget the march today from
the University of London Union to
Hyde Park.
Fares Fair
O n Sunday, March 21, the cost of
travelling on London Transport
will double because of the House
of Lords ruling the G L C 'Fares
Fair' subsidy illegal. London will
then have the most expensive
urban transport system in the
world.
Most rational people can see
the necessity of subsidising public
transport Even under the Fares
Fair scheme the public subsidy
that London Transport received
was lower than in many other
European and American cities.
The only solution is to persuade
the government to change the law.
T h a t ' s w h e r e y o u m a k e y o u r

lives or works in London. Write
now to your M P urging him/her to

O n Tuesday of next week the SF
Soc will show the film that this
bulletin reported as being shown
last week. This is not my fault, I
only obey orders. It is due to
excessive thionite intake c o m -
bined with a recent reading of
Slaughterhouse 5 on the part of
the secretary. A l l those of you
who keep back copies of F E L I X
can read my comments of last
week for information on The Big

12:30pm we are showing a film

world's most dangerous sports.
Not to be missed.
There are also still places left for
the Scotland trip at Easter (March
27 to April 3). For further informa-

M e e t i n g calling for an e n d to
Imperial Colleg e contacts with
South Africa and on Tuesday,

Beaumont and Cosmas Desmond,
a f o r m e r p o l i t i c a l p r i s o n e r i n

need for Sanctions". This will be a
good opportunity to hear first
hand about South Africa.
Ents
In Ents we like to play a game. It's
called 'Simon Says'. Basically it
goes like this: If Simon says do
something we immediately jump
to and do it! A n d of course if
Simon says don't do it we are
m o r e t h a n h a p p y to oblige —
"Shaw thing boss!"
Well apart from that we are
honoured to present an 'Alter-
native Entertainments Evening'
with topical comedy revue 'The
Chip Shop Show', four hours of
rock promotional videos and a live
band. Throw in a swinging 'alter-
native' disco, cartoons and the
usual liquid refreshments gives
you a fun filled evening. You're not
doing anything else tonight so
bring a pound note and enjoy!
Next week's film is none other
than The China Syndrome. Usual
place, time and price—be there!
Don't forget the Rugby Sevens on

Micro-club
Lectures
O n Tuesday, M a r c h 9, at 7:00pm in Huxley 145 David Buckley of
Micromouse fame will be telling us of the trials and tribulations involved in
getting an electronic mouse to explore and find the centre of a large maze
in the shortest possible time. Hopefully his own mouse Quester will be
demonstrated. S o all you hardware people out there, this is for you.
Tuesday, March 16, at 7:00pm in Huxley 145; this is a lecture you've all
been waiting for. After much arm-twisting I N M O S will be giving us a
presentation on different aspects of VLSI and will be talking amongst
other things about H D L — t h e i r chip design language and how Britain's
microchip industry can compete with the Japanese. Hopefully we may
also get an insight into their future productions.
News
As you may already know the Union have granted us the money to buy a
B B C model B micro which will make a welcome addition to the club's
equipment. When this new computer will materialise depends on the
efficiency of Acorn, but hopefully it will be before the end of the current
academic year. Also in the pipeline is a donation of an Acorn Atom by a
generous benefactor together with, hopefully, a new wire wrap gun. W e
also have a line printer in need of interfacing, and a line to the College's
mainframe.
For further details on joining the Micro Club drop a letter to Jon
Davies of D o C 2 via internal mail.
The 1982 R A G R A C E

called Harry's Bar) at 8:00pm tonight, you can listen in the Halls round
