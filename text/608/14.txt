An apology
I apologise for the severe cuts made to articles
this w e e k . I ' m afraid that t h e e l e c t i o n
manifestos have necessitated a reduction in
the space available for clubs, societies, etc.
Hopefully I've included any vital information
and normal service....(yawn, yawn).
Letters
It has been suggested that I make up or
commission all the letters! This is absolute
r u b b i s h . M y letters w o u l d be far m o r e
interesting than the drivel I've received in the
past few weeks. Where have all the good
letters gone?
The Barclays Bit
I must admit that I expected to be challenged
over including a Barclays advert earlier. M r
G a r s i d e ' s letter is to say the least fairly
predictable, but it does merit a response.
Firstly, I will happily except adverts from
Barclays for financial reasons. This bank and
others provide a large amount of support for
various publications (and hence indirectly the
Union) by advertising.
Without their support the Union would have
to save in the order of £1,000 elsewhere—
perhaps by abolishing Socialist Society, Anti-
Apartheid G r o u p , Labour Club, Liberal Club,
etc., etc.? I'm certain that such committed
individuals w o u l d rather fund their o w n
activities than take money from Barclays.
H o w e v e r this a r g u m e n t is n o t really
sufficient by itself. A more important reason is
personal freedom.

I must reiterate that I abhor censorship and
believe i n freedom of e x p r e s s i o n . W h i l s t
sympathizing with the fight against apartheid I
w o u l d not willingly exclude adverts from
anyone {even vile multi-nationals) as I believe
that i n d i v i d u a l s at I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e a r e
intelligent enough to discriminate between the
companies and organisations with which they
want to be involved. Students are well aware of
the issues involved in South Africa, including
B a r c l a y s ' i n v o l v e m e n t , a n d c a n c h o o s e
whether they wish to bank with them or not.
Perhaps most important of all, Barclays are
a damn good bank and are not the only
investors in South Africa. Unfortunately South
A f r i c a has a tight grip over international
finance due to its mineral wealth and, unless
we wish to trade with the Soviet Union for
gold, uranium, etc., we are stuck. Personally I
find the Soviet Union's system of 'democracy'
equally unacceptable.
By not giving people the chance to choose
we are repressing their own freedom. So come
on Anti-Apartheid persons, stop complaining.
It's just not cricket.
Hustings UGM
This wasn't half as exciting o r entertaining
as usual. Presumably this was due to the
candidates themselves.
The only positive thing to come out of it
was to reaffirm my conviction that I should
abstain in the H o n o r a r y Secretary election,
as none of the candidates struck me as
being outstanding. A s for the others, judge
for yourself by reading their manifestos.

twelve coins, all of which look the same, but
one of which is a slightly different weight from
the other eleven. W i t h just a n o r d i n a r y
balance, which can be used to compare the
weights of two piles of coins, you are asked to
find the fake coin and determine whether it is
too heavy or too light.
In the standard solution to this puzzle, the
second and third weighings you make depend
on the result of the first weighing. What I'm
after this week is a solution to the fake coin
p u z z l e i n w h i c h all the c o m p a r i s o n s a r e
specified before any of the weighings are
made.
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me at the
FELIX Office, please. There is a prize of £5
(donated by Mend-a-Bike) and two tickets to
the IC Orchestra concert next Friday for the
correct entry selected at 1:00 pm next
Wednesday.
Last W e e k ' s Puzzle
About twenty people got last week's puzzle
right, and about twelve of them found it
remarkably easy, since they'd all made the
same arithmetical slip. I'm reluctant to award
the prize to anyone who got a (quite difficult)
puzzle right just because their maths is faulty,
so I'm holding the c o m p e t i t i o n open for
another week to allow those people who gave
no reasoning with their solution to submit a
few words of explanation.
D r . B e r k s h i r e i n t h e d e p a r t m e n t of
mathematics has pointed out that there is a
slight i m p r o v e m e n t to t h e m e t h o d for
balancing dominoes which I described last
week. If you move the top domino slightly
towards the centre of the table, then the
bottom domino can be moved further out over
the edge, allowing a minute extra overhang.
