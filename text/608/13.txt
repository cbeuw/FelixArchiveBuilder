Hyde Park Relay
A r a t h e r c h i l l y , c l o u d y "day greeted the
runners i n the race o n Saturday i n H y d e
Park. This had some advantages in that the
annual problem of spectators on the course
was less than usual. The race was quite a
success with the fastest time for the men's
three mile laps of 13.17 by Dave Clarke, only
five seconds slower than the record of 13.12
set by H . Jones in 1980. H e was, however,
ineligible for a prize as he is a member of stalf
at the West L o n d o n Institute for Higher
Education.

anyone up, had a mens team in 75th position
and a ladies team in 19th position out of a
field of 110 men's teams and 29 ladies teams.
I would like to thank everybody who came

and even those who were just spectating.
Also thanks should go to R i c h a r d Smith,

whom it would not have been possible.

handling, but the thrust of Downs and Miles
Thompson was often cut out by the keen
Q M C back-row and three-quarters. H a d the
Gutteridge C u p not been at stake, F'azakerly
might have passed the ball to his three-
quarters more often, but sadly this was outside
the tactics of the game. A l l IC's points came in
the first-half, with the wind in Thompson's
favour.
Q M C lost two players during the battle
and perhaps the front-five of IC's pack did
give their opposition too much rough stuff.
After the game, A d a m Warby, IC's multi-
talented skipper, was disappointed to hear
that the England selectors did not consider
him as a likely choice to fill the full-back
position on Saturday. They felt his kicking
was not u p to scratch.
M a n y thanks to all the I C supporters who
turned u p to watch their idols gain victory.

Well we made it into the final, but were
t h w a r t e d by the Leaves sisters o f G u y s
H o s p i t a l . These t w o y o u n g ladies w i t h
v a r i o u s E n g l i s h E u r o p e a n titles to their
names proceeded to thrash us i n the ladies
doubles and single whereas our wonderful
men annihilated the opposition with very
little difficulty. This left everything to the
three mixed doubles, which went 2-1 in Guys
favour, not even the superstar pairing of
Chris Hull'et a n d Andree Mitchell could
combat the younger of the Leaves sisters
influence. The result was 6-5 to Guys.
Stage management, tactical coordination
and plastic cup fetching by our noble leader,
Ian Bull.

Castaways Cup
This is the most important and prestigious
event in the U K sailing calendar, it is open to
any team from L o n d o n or City University
a n d this year eleven teams e n t e r e d , I C
entered two teams.
O n S a t u r d a y the s a i l i n g w a s i n t w o
leagues, the top two teams from each going
through into a league on Sunday to decide
the final placings. T h e "starboard" league on
Saturday was won by I C l who won four out
of five races, with University College second.
St M a r y ' s Hospitals/Kings College won the
'port' league with I C A second, scraping
through by beating St. Thomas' Hospital in a
race where both teams retired by sailing one
lap too few a n d Thomas' took one more
'green' (penalty) than I C A .
O n Sunday the wind was excellent ibr
t e a m r a c i n g a n d f u r t h e r i n t e r e s t w a s
provided by a large number of Wembley
S.C. boats who were racing round some of the
same marks as U L . St. M a r y ' s Hospital
retired after being resoundingly thrashed by
I C A and U C . As I C A prepared to sail I C l
the course was changed and had to be sailed
in, the opposite direction. This led to the
Lewis epic "push everyone the right side of
the m a r k a n d then sail the w r o n g side
y o u r s e l f m a n o e u v r e " . F o l l o w i n g t h i s ,
Chadwick leaned out over-enthusiastically
and missed the toe-straps o n the beat and
went swimming. Ajderian covering Lewis on
the final beat forced him to gybe to break the
cover and gave I C A first, second and fifth on
the line..
I C l , sailing excellently, beat University
College convincingly i n both the races they
were to sail against them.
I C A beating U C in a close fought contest
by l l ' / 2 to l l 3
/ . , pts, made it clear that the
real competition was between two I C teams.
T h e v i o l e n c e o n the line caused sur-
prisingly only one collision and despite five ol
the six boats arriving at the w i n d w a r d mark
together, there were no collisions there. T h e
sixth boat, sailed by C u r w e n , had recrossed
the start line a n d was some w a y behind.
Places changed continuously down to the
leeward m a r k where, again, A d j started
sitting o n Lewis a n d general malevolence
eminating from all quarters meant that by
the second rounding of the windward mark
six collisions or infringements had occured,
three by each side. T h e n in a fair(ish) light
I C l won but not by a sufficient amount to
have an overall win over I C A .
This left I C A only to beat U C for the
overall ittle, they did this excellently pushing
one U C boat to the back requiring U C to get
first place to win. O n an excellent final beat
the super heavy weight N i c k A d j a g a i n
pulled through into first place allowing M i l l s
who had sailed consistantly well throughout
the weekend into third race.
Thanks are due to Castaways for excellent
social and racing organisation.

Ajderian, J. Redman, P. Mills, R. Tostevin.
