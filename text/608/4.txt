The truth about my
other life
by Barney McCabe
H o w much more of this bullshit must we be
subjected to? Nobody, least of all an election
candidate, has yet hit upon what doing a
sabbatical Union job is about. It's not about
boycotting this, opposing that, striking here or
occupying there. It's not about making U G M s
interesting, or getting people involved in and to
respect "their Union". A l l of these ideas are
what a large group of egotistical ignorami
imagine are the key functions of a "sabbatical".
They are wrong.
The most important qualify needed in a
sabbatical is a commitment to helping other
people; whether it be directing them to the
nearest MacDonalds or opening the G y m
c h a n g i n g r o o m s , t h e r e m u s t be t h a t
commitment to helping. 90% of the job I do is
geared to helping students get on with their
business.
The organisation of which I am part and
which exists generally to serve students has
two distinct functions. The first is to provide
administrative back-up for well over 100 active
clubs and societies; rooms and equipment for
s t u d e n t s ' use a n d a stable o r g a n i s a t i o n
distributing public money fairly among those
s o c i e t i e s . T h e s e c o n d f u n c t i o n of this
organisation is to ensure that all the other
services (provided mostly by College) for
students—from "an education" to refectories,
residence to welfare—are provided as high
a standard as possible. For the Union to
perform this second function there exists a
complete network of accountable (i.e. elected)
representatives or observers on all the College
decision and policy making committees (apart,
that is, from the Rector's Policy Committee
and the Examining Boards!). The representa-
tives play an extremely valuable role in putting
the students' case where it is relevant. In this
way, the Union plays a constructive part in the
running of the College; a part which is fully
integrated with the a d m i n i s t r a t i o n of the
College and which is respected by those who
ultimately govern it.
By far the greatest demand on a sabbatical's
time (especially the D P s and H o n Sees) comes
from the first of the two functions outlined
above. The wrath of the few hundred people
per day who visit the Union Office would soon
be d o w n o n a s a b b a t i c a l w h o , t h r o u g h
campaigning in other directions, allowed his
attentions to sway from the needs of the
societies. Fine he/she would make U G M s
popular; fine he/she would make more news
for F E L I X ; fine he/she would achieve great
political popularity; but at what expense? It
would be quite wrong to damage the clubs and
societies merely in order to conform to the
misconceptions of a misguided few, after all
how does one judge the success of a nation? Is
it by the size and strength of its army, or, is it
by the quality of life of its people?
"But what about U G M s ? " I hear you ask. As
far as I am concerned a U G M is where I go for
a little self-indulgent fun. it is a forum for
debate which leads to policy; it is a rubber-
stamp body but that is not all. No! It's a great
o p p o r t u n i t y for egotists to further their
interests. The h a c k s and would-be h a c k s
among you will probably be crying out in
d i s g u s t at my l a c k of c o n c e r n for o u r
democratic body. A U G M is not democratic, it
has nothing to do with democracy, it merely
serves to give the appearance to College of
enormous student power when it mandates
one of us to pursue a particular policy. That's
about the only reason why we bother with
them at all.
In summary, I have enjoyed most of the
publicity I've personally had at IC, soT'm sure,
have other Union Officers. M u c h of it has been
untrue, but it's all been fun. I wouldn't have let
myself in for all those snotty jobs which are
never individually important or interesting
enough to mention in F E L I X if it wasn't for the
opportunity of a bit of ego-tripping, nor would
anyone else in their right mind.
May I suggest that, should you want to vote,
you vote for proven commitment to helping
others, and vote for technical competance in
every field, from Committee handling through
to duplicator operating to pinball machine
repairing!
Thank-you for reading.
The case against
Apartheid
by Graeme Shaw
1982 has been declared "International Year of
M o b i l i s a t i o n of S a n c t i o n s Against S o u t h
Africa" by the United Nations. The issue about
sanctions is an old one. It was first introduced
in about 1957. However, the reason why it has
had little effect is that there has been no
solidarity in the sanctions campaign, there
have always been countries that disobeyed U N
policy, and unfortunately Britain is the worst
culprit. At the last U N Assembly, fourteen
resolutions were passed on apartheid; only
two countries did not vote for them, one was
the U S A and the other, Britain.
The need for sanctions against S Africa has
come about because of the "stubborn efforts
of the regime to perpetuate racist domination
by an ever increasing dependence on violence
and r e p r e s s i o n a n d to continue its illegal
occupation of Namibia, in defiance of repeated
appeals by the international community and
flagrant contravention of the United Nations
Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and the Declaration on Granting of
Independence to C o l o n i a l C o u n t r i e s and
P e o p l e s " this has " c r e a t e d an explosive
situation in Southern Africa and constitutes no
longer a threat to, but a manifest breach of
international peace and securityj'
But why hasn't the U N Security Council
taken any action? Simple, because Britain and
the U S A are p e r m a n e n t m e m b e r s of the
Council.
The call for sanctions is total and complete,
it includes an effective oil embargo, a cessation
of c o l l a b o r a t i o n with S o u t h A f r i c a in the
military and nuclear fields, and of investments
in and loans to South Africa, it also calls for the
denial of certain supplies, such as electronic
and communications equipment, machinery
and chemicals, as well as technology.
Y o u m a y argue that by i m p l e m e n t i n g
sanctions Britain would be doing more harm to
the black o p p r e s s e d people in S o u t h e r n
Africa. The U N recognizes this, but the people
in South Africa and the frontline states have
already laid their heads on the line by making
the plea for sanctions, have we the right to say
they are wrong? Still, the U N affirms that the
cost of sanctions is very small compared to the
cost of the existing h u m a n suffering a n d
degradation in South Africa and the threat to
international peace.
Alternatively, you may argue that sanctions
would be detrimental to the British economy,
as we depend upon trade with South Africa,
e s p e c i a l l y for s o m e m i n e r a l s , s u c h as
vanadium and tungsten. However, much of
this dependence is false, unnecessary and
foolish; D r David Owen, when he was British
Foreign Secretary stated that "we are in a
position of depending on South Africa far more \
than is healthy if we are to pursue consistent
and viable foreign and economic policies."
People also argue that British companies
would do more good by operating in South
Africa than by pulling out, but what is the
evidence to support this? The non-whites still
have poor wages, about a tenth of those for
white workers, few amenities, poor education
and housing and barely any political or civil
rights. Even Barclays, which is better than,
most companies, gives fewer opportunities to
its black employees, and although they pay
wages that are higher than the national
average, it is of little use when they are actively
s u p p o r t i n g the g o v e r n m e n t , b? b u y i n g
Government Defense Bonds for example.
South Africa is a "democracy" (for whites)
and not all of them support apartheid as
fervently as the government, so it would take
only a little more international pressure to
make a majority of the whites realise that the
time had come to dismantle the apartheid
regime. It wouldn't take long if sanctions were
applied, and Britain could manage without
trading with South Africa, for a short while at
least, whether by stockpiling beforehand or else
u s i n g a l t e r n a t i v e s u p p l i e r s . E v e n p a r t i a l
sanctions would have an effect, or cutting off
diplomatic relations—but something must be
done.
Imperial College too is linked to South Africa.
In 1965 Sir William Penney, C h a i r m a n of
U K A E A and Rector of IC, visited South Africa
"when the Pelindaba reactor went 'critical'". In
1979 there was an advert in the Johannesburg
Sunday Times inviting students to apply for a
c o u r s e in n u c l e a r r e a c t o r s c i e n c e a n d
engineering at Imperial College. The Royal
School of Mines has obvious examples of
collaboration with South Africa; there are
about half a dozen students sponsored by
South African companies, students work out
there during the summer vacation and some
even go out there to live and lecturers often
visit to give seminars or advise. This is all in
contravention of U N policy.
The College C a r e e r s A d v i s o r y Service
invites such companies as Rio Tinto Zinc,
Chartered Consolidated Services Ltd (part of
Anglo American) and others to the College,
f i e s e c o m p a n i e s c o m e to recruit white
students to work in South Africa, to help boost
the economy and sustain the apartheid regime.
It would do no one any harm to end our
hospitality to these companies; the Careers
Advisory Service could still publicise their
vacancies and graduates could simply treck
across L o n d o n for their interviews. T h u s
nobody's freedom would be impeded and we
could show our disapproval of the South
African government.
So what else can we do? Stop banking with
Barclays is one answer, it is still the biggest
bank in South Africa and supports the Pretoria
regime, far more so than any other high street
bank. S e c o n d l y , don't buy S o u t h A f r i c a n
products and thirdy, go on the National March
on March 14. Help end racisim in the world
and help the coloured majority in South Africa
by supporting the U N ' s year for sanctions.
