Hon. Secretary: ROBYN MORGAN proposed by Ray Goundry
The job of Honorary Secretary has two sides:
administrative duties and, to quote from the
job description "....a political function as a
member of the Executive committee". The
administrative duties range from taking,
reproducing and circulating minutes of the
numerous committees on which he sits to
allocating parking permits and being Returning
Officer for Union elections. However, it is the
political function as a member of the Executive
that makes the Honorary Secretary more than
just a nine-to-five administrator. Whilst it is the
President's job to actually represent the views
of students to College, to other students and
to other external bodies, determining the
views a n d s u g g e s t i n g s o l u t i o n s to any
problems must be initiated by all members of
the e x e c u t i v e , i n c l u d i n g the H o n o r a r y
Secretary.
I believe that I have the enthusiasm to
perform the administrative duties required and
The Guff
By now you will no doubt have gathered that
on Monday and Tuesday (March 8 and 9) next
year's sabbatical officers will be elected. Only
Martin S. Taylor has stood for F E L I X Editor
(so there will be elections for the posts of
President, Deputy President and Honorary
Secretary). His statement of intent will appear
in next week's issue.
Hopefully you will have witnessed the
candidates' antics at yesterday's U G M , and
will have seen the bumpf they have produced.
In this special F E L I X supplement you can read
their individual manifestos, all positively
bulging with wonderful promises and extensive
qualifications.
Before giving some advice on how to choose
a candidate, I will explain the voting system
used.
STV
Firstly to vote at all you will need a valid IC
Unioncard. B y showing this you can collect a
ballot paper at any of the ballot boxes, which
will be situated in all departments from
9:00am to 5:00pm on Monday and
Tuesday. T h e c a r d will be p u n c h e d to
the desire to take a full part in the initiation and
execution of ideas as part of the Executive. I
will not be afraid to propose radical changes in
the Union if this is needed but only if it is likely
that such a course of action will serve the
interests of students and has the support of
students. I also believe that experience of the
workings of the Union is, at least, desirable
and, through being a member last year and
chairman this year of the Permanent Working
Party and thus having a seat on Council, I have
the knowledge to perform my duties efficiently.
To conclude, I ask you first to use your vote.
This does not of itself guarantee a Union that
reflects its members' views but it is a step in
the right direction. Secondly, I ask you to vote
for me, for an Honorary Secretary who does
more than his job is worth.
Robyn Morgan
indicate that you have voted. Y o u must cast
your vote immediately and not take ballot
papers away.
T h e voting system used is the Single
Transferable Vote (STV), by which you
express your preference by putting numbers
1, 2, 3 etc. by the candidates' names on the
ballot paper. However, if you only have one
preference put a 1 by that candidates name
and leave the other spaces blank.
The purpose of this system is that if there
are three or more candidates for a post, your
vote is not "lost" if your first choice candidate
is not elected, but can help your second choice
win over a third or fourth candidate.
T o vote against a candidate, leave the space
blank rather than putting a 2 or 3 against the
name.
If you are unable to decide between the
candidates for a post or know nothing about
any of them, then I urge you to abstain by
writing A B S T E N T I O N across the boxes for
that post.
For a valid election 25% of the U n i o n
membership must register a vote. Abstentions
count as votes cast but spoilt papers (i.e.
defaced, blank or with crosses) are not.
The election for a post will be re-run if
s o m e o n e r e g i s t e r s a v a l i d c o m p l a i n t on
procedure with the Elections Committee, if
less than 25% of the membership vote, or if all
fail to pass quota due to abstentions.
Advice
It is important that we elect four sabbaticals
who will perform their duties well. After all,
these people influence the activity of the Union
to such an extent, that you should make an
effort to ensure an informed decision.
Firstly, by reading election handouts and
posters you will be able to find out who is
standing and why.
Hustings are usually a surprisingly good way
of deciding â€” y o u ' d be a m a z e d at how
people's real qualities are revealed during
speeches and especially questions. If y o u
didn't attend yesterday's U G M then ask a
friend how the candidates fared. But a word of
warning: N E V E R be influenced too much by a
proposer. Y o u must r e m e m b e r that the
proposer will not be doing the job and will
normally have been chosen to say the few
things that a candidate's modesty may prevent
him from revealing personally.
As for the various promises made in the
manifestos (and elsewhere), you must be
critical; decide what you think that the
sabbatical should do and then find the best
candidate.
Some people warp the truth or lie outright,
but you must try to choose people who intend
to do something and not just keep the Union
ticking over.
Y o u should not be influenced by sex, race or
other asides but choose the best person who
has the ability to perform the duties required.
Also do not pay too much attention to strings
of qualifications, but concentrate on why one
person's ideas might be better than another.
Of course you can always abstain if you
think all the candidates are poor. I intend to do
this in the Honorary Secretary election for
instance, because none of the candidates
could possibly convince me that they are
suitable. I will abstain in the hope that the H o n
Sec election will be re-run and somebody who I
consider is suited for the post will stand
(perhaps a defeated candidate from one of the
other elections?).
So r e m e m b e r to vote on M o n d a y a n d
Tuesday, even if you know nothing about the
candidates and merely wish to abstain. Every
vote cast is important in that it gives a measure
of popularity, interest and satisfaction with the
candidates and Union.
