President: STEVE GOULDER proposed by Pallab Ghosh
The Candidate
Stephen Goulder is a third year undergraduate
in the Biochemistry department. While at
Imperial College has taken an active and
constructive role in the Union. A s Social Clubs
Committee Chairman he has encouraged a
substantial increase in club activity. T h i s
affects a wide range of students, not just
hacks. Steve also spent eight months last year
coordinating the R C S Centenary celebrations.
Steve has proved himself to be an able
candidate for President. He has the experience
and ability to bring about improvements for
students next year.

The Policies
Refectories
Little has been done to improve the quality of
food available in College. To achieve anything
we must demonstrate widespread popular
support for our policies. I intend to do this by
organising a refectory boycott for the first
week of N o v e m b e r . A s President I also
propose to bring the Union Refectory under
Union control as a profit making concern.
Residence
It is clear that any new student accommodation
must be in the form of Head Tenancies or
short life housing schemes. However, some
conditions in Hamlet and Cambridge Gardens
are appalling. I do not expect students to live in
such conditions, the Union will support any
action taken to improve this situation.
External Affairs
We must have an active voice in the current
reorganisation of London University instigated
by S w i n n e r t o n - D y e r . B e c a u s e of its high
proportion of overseas students it is important
t h a t I t a k e a s p e c i a l i n t e r e s t in t h e i r
increasingly difficult situation.
Academic Affairs
It will be essential for me to take an active role
in Academic Affairs next session when the first
part of the Rector's 20% cut in all departments
is being made. We must fight any cut in
student numbers and in the quality of learning
at this College.

President: ANDREW LYALL proposed by David Jago
It is almost universally a c c e p t e d a m o n g
Imperial College students that in recent years
their Union has become completely out of
touch with the student body. The small group
of students who traditionally surround the
Executive are not typical of the IC student and
serve only to isolate them from student
o p i n i o n . T h e best way to o v e r c o m e this
problem would be for the President to hold a
regular surgery on, say Monday lunchtime
during which any student, not merely officers
and 'hacks' will be able to talk with the Union
President about anything that might concern
him/her, be it academic, personal or political.
This, you may think is very simple â€” it is, but I
m u s t e m p h a s i z e , u n l i k e the g r a n d a n d
exhorbitant claims presidential candidates
normally make its simplicity means that it will
become a reality.
In my view implementation of such simple
ideas will bring about the m u c h needed,
increased c o m m u n i c a t i o n w h i c h will itself
bring great rewards in other directions: for a
united student body lead by an informed and
determined President will be hard to resist.
At first sight, through not having previously
held high office in the Union, it may seem that I
am underqualified for the job of President.
However in my five years at IC (two on my
legs, one in hospital and the last two in a wheel
chair) I have always represented my year
group on the staff/student academic affairs
c o m m i t t e e s , I have t a k e n two degrees in
widely differing subjects, experienced two
constituent colleges and their unions and met
a great number of people.
I would like to be the new type of Union
President Imperial College desperately needs
in this coming year. T o do it I need your vote.
The choice is yours.

President: J.MARTIN TAYLOR proposed by Andrew Needham
I decided at the outset of this campaign not to
make unkeepable promises merely to grab
votes. But there's only space for a brief outline
of my intentions, so very quickly.
Grants
I think it's time we stopped burying our head in
the sand. Next year is going to be very difficult
for many students, and we must campaign to
prevent the year after being even worse.
Education Cuts
Many of you will have felt their first effects.
Worse is to come. However, we shouldn't just
have blanket opposition to all changes caused
by cuts. We must play a full part in discussions
s u r r o u n d i n g t h e m , whilst maintaining o u r
opposition.
Refectories
There have been some improvements this
year at the Union's instigation. We must keep
on pushing our ideas next year. I won't be
calling for a boycott, because Mooney simply
isn't capable of doing his job without our help.
Residence
This year we've accepted mid-session rent
increases without protest. I'm determined to
stop this happening again. Halls are very
expensive already and steps must be taken to
hold costs down next year.
In general the President must take time to
gauge opinion, not just rely on the few people
at U G M s . Socialising other than in the Union
Bar is essential.
A l s o , he m u s t s t a n d up for students
i n t e r e s t s , n o t a l w a y s b e n d i n g to the
convenience of the College authorities.
Finally, beware. So much crap is talked in
these elections, even by candidates w h o
should know better. If you want a President
who is experienced (I've been External Affairs
Officer for IV2 years), sees things from a
student (not a College) point of view, and isn't
just out to inflate his own ego or get a cushy
job next year, then give me your vote.
Cut the crap and let's go!
