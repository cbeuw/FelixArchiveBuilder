True Islamic Caliphate promotes peace, not terror
This year, the true face of
Islamic Caliphate has been
obscured by the smoke rising
from Iraq. Kindled by the horrific
actions of militant extremist group
ISIS, the conflict there has not only
scorched the lands of Syria and
Iraq, but has left in cinders the very
principles on which the extremists
claim to stand. True Caliphate is a
spiritual leadership to promote peace,
not political leadership to impose
power. Understanding how and why
extremists twist Islam to meet their
own ends is vital in the ongoing fight
against extremism.
A ‘Caliph’ is literally a ‘successor.’
When the Prophet Muhammad died,
a system of Caliphate was established
whereby successors were elected to act
as a spiritual leaders of the Muslim
community. This lasted around 30
years, after which internal divisions
led to fractures within the Muslim
community that still survive to this
day. Regardless, everyone is agreed –
anyone who claims to be an Islamic
Caliph today is claiming to be a
successor of the Prophet Muhammad.
With that title comes certain
conditions: conditions which the so-
called Caliphate of ISIS certainly fail
to meet.
Where to begin? Their compulsion
in conversion directly violates
numerous teachings of the Qur’an
that instruct Muslims to only
convey their message, and never
force it onto anyone (2:256; 18:29;
10:99). Their aggressive territorial
warfare is strictly condemned in the
Qur’an, which only allows defensive
warfare to safeguard the human
rights of the innocent (22:39; 2:193).
Their butchering of the innocent is
anathema to Islam, which regards
the murder of one innocent like
the murder of all mankind (5:33).
Their enslavement and treatment of
women is the very inhumanity that
Islam came to fix, declaring women
to be spiritually equal to men, and
codifying the rights that are naturally
theirs (33:35; 39:6; 4:34; 2:228; 90:13).
Much more can be said, but their list
of atrocities is sadly unending, unlike
this column.
To impartially study the life of
the Prophet and his Successors is to
know they were peaceful pioneers.
The Prophet Muhammad allowed
Christians to pray in his Mosque
- something no-one’s expecting
to happen in Iraq anytime soon.
His second Successor, Omar, once
declined the offer of Christians to
pray in their Church, only out of fear
that misguided followers would one
day seek to annex it. The difference
between ISIS and Islam’s early leaders
is as stark as night and day.
As such, ISIS will no doubt die their
own death, but not before causing
more misery for the people of Iraq.
Where to go from here then? In a
recent Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace
Symposium attended by dignitaries
and MPs, Mirza Masroor Ahmad,
the world’s most widely followed
Caliph, asked Western powers to
reflect on ISIS’s source of funding.
Ahmad remarked, “it is quite obvious
that they are receiving the help
and support of certain powers. This
could be direct support from very
oil-rich states or it could be other
major powers covertly providing
assistance.” Radical ideology may be
the spark, but it needs oxygen to keep
on burning.
Unfortunately for us students, we
can realistically do little to change
the pertinent political dimensions.
But we are by no means helpless;
through educating ourselves about
the reality of Islam and Caliphate we
can collectively counter the pseudo-
religious claims of extremists.

Rest assured: religion teaches that
true spiritual leadership is that which
takes us closer to our Creator. Those
who spread disorder amongst His
creation couldn’t have gotten it more
wrong.
