An Excavation of the Bloody Horrors of Warfare
Fred Fyles explores brutal photographs of wars gone by at the Tate Modern
"A brutal
awakening
of the
horrors of
war, and the
debilitating
effect of
time gone
by"
“There is an aggression implicit in
every use of the camera”
- Susan Sontag
Since the dawn of the camera, the
photographer has returned to a
number of themes: the beauty
of nature, the danger of the streets,
the glamour of the rich and famous.
And yet, there is one subject that
has captured the photographer’s
attention like none other: Conflict.
From corpses piled high at Bergen-
Belsen, to the tattered remnants of
Palestinian homes, it seems that the
spectacle of war has always struck
humanity as one worth observing.
Just as light, filtered through a Leica’s
aperture, permeates a strip of film,
so to do these photographs strike our
senses and imprint themselves on our
consciousness.
But what of the aftermath? Does
time, that most potent of medicines,
surely has the power to heal all
wounds? The answers can be found in
the Tate Modern’s latest exhibition;
entitled Conflict, Time, Photography,
it aims to explore the lasting legacy
of war. In an example of curatorial
brilliance, the Tate has arranged the
photos, not in terms of subject, or
date, but by length of time post-
conflict. It does not resemble an art
gallery so much as an archeological
dig; with each room we permeate
deeper and deeper into our collective
memories, tunnelling through the
strata and unearthing bone-chilling
bounties.
In the photos taken immediately
after conflict, what is most startling
is not the horror of war, but rather
the stillness with which each photo
is imbued. Luc Delahaye’s photo of
an ICD explosion in central Iraq is
blanketed in a grey, muted silence;
we see the time before the dust has
settled, before the screams begin.
Similarly, Don McCullin’s Shell-
shocked US Marine, Vietnam, has an
unsettling calm about it; the soldier
stares out, his eyes bulging out of his
head, through which no doubt the
conflict that had been raging seconds
before is now replaying. He does
not notice McCullin. He does not
notice the camera. He is blind to the
world, receptive only to his internal
torment.
In terms of scope, the Tate has
pulled out all the stops, exploring
wars long gone and conflicts still
raging. The message is clear; all war is
horrific, and it is all worth exploring.
In a year of overzealous politicians
focussing on the centenary of WWI,
and an increasingly jingoistic attitude
being taken towards how one should
commemorate those who died, it
is refreshing to be reminded that
conflict did not begin in 1914, and
certainly did not end with the Treaty
of Versailles, despite the hopes of a
continent in a post-war daze.
Some of the works focuses on the
most obvious aspect of conflict:
the lasting legacy of ruination and
destruction it leaves behind. In
the months that followed WWI a
number of guides to northern France
were published, allowing a crowd of
horror-tourists to satisfy their blood-
lust; continuing in such a vein, we
are presented with a series of photos
surveying the destruction wrought
upon Riems, whose cathedral became
a symbol of French hope. Its nave is
blasted, its statues crumbling, and
yet the edifice still stands tall, not
yet willing to become a victim of
war. In comparison, the damage left
by the bombing of Dresden, levelled
in a mere two days with a cost of
25,000 lives, is harrowingly captured
in Richard Peter’s damning book
Dresden: A Camera Accuses, published
in 1949.
Such images are not conceived as a
call to arms; they are not histrionic.
They do not scream their message
from the rooftops, but instead softly
deliver an inescapable message: that
war is an inconceivable horror, and
humanity has an endless capacity for
evil. Nowhere is this more apparent
that in the work of Shomei Tomatsu,
whose stunning black and white
photographs of Nagasaki twenty
years after the atomic blast form
the focus of the exhibition, both
physically and emotionally.
‘Nakasaki’, Tomatsu explains, ‘Has
two times; there is 11:02, August
9th, 1945; and there is all the time
since then. And we must not forget
either of them’. This precise time is
taken from a broken watch, whose
hands fused to the lens the moment
of the blast; it looms out at us from
the print, its strap gone, its dial
chipped, like a vast, unblinking eye.
Its function is no longer to tell us
the time, but instead to allow us to
remember and reflect on the horrors
of the bomb. But Tomatsu documents
another time: the present. He looks
at those who have grown up in the
shadow of the bomb, taking dramatic,
close-cropped, unforgiving photos of
those who were injured, their keloid
scars spreading like vast spider-webs
down their necks.
Elsewhere, the focus is on what is
missing, such as Emeric Lhuisset’s
tribute to murdered Iraqi journalist
Sardasht Osman, I Heard the First
Ring of my Death, or Taryn Simon’s
genealogical studies performed in the
wake of the Srebrenica Massacre, in
which family trees are reconstructed,
with images of bones and teeth
exhumed from mass graves replacing
pictures of those who were killed. In
such work it is the space that remains
unfilled that is examined; the empty
chair, the shoes left behind.
Diana Matar takes this theme and
applies it to the Libyan Civil War, in
her breathtaking series Evidence, in
which she photographs sites of former
human rights abuses. In each case the
photograph is accompanied by a short
text describing that particular crime;
we learn that these humble homes
were fired upon by invading forces,
that this billboard was put up in the
wake of a public double-hanging. The
most powerful photo of hers is also
the smallest: a square photograph of
a calm sea, measuring about 15cm
across, into which the remains of
1270 political prisoners were dumped
after their bones had been ground
into a fine powder. Matar uses her
camera as a tool for truth, uncovering
what many people have tried hard to
leave behind.
A strange dichotomy exists within
the exhibition between the work
that is conceptual and that which
is – essentially – photojournalism.
In some works the line blurs, such as
in the multiple series looking at the
brutalist defences left behind by the
Germans on the French coastline in
WWII, but they never come across
as more than a poor man’s version of
Bernd and Hilla Becher. Ultimately,
"Tomatsu's
photographs
of Nagasaki
form the
focus of the
exhibition,
physically
and
emotionally"
nothing can compare to the work of
McCullin and Tomatsu, whose photos
need no explanation; their impact is
immediately apparent. With their
grainy, black and white, seemingly
off-the-cuff style, these works come
the closest to true photojournalism
– indeed, McCullin is the only
journalist included in the show – and
perhaps it would have been nice if
the Tate had focussed more on such
artists.
Near the end of the exhibition we
are shown work from Istory, a project
from Syrian photographer Hrair
Sarkissian, in which he explored the
semi-public and private archives
that exist in Istanbul. With their
minimal lighting, the photos have
an oppressive quality that reflects
the confidential nature of the
files contained within these vast
collections. The stories have been
shut away, consigned to the filing
cabinet of history, but Sarkissian
exposes them, even momentarily, to
the light of day. And this is what the
Tate Modern achieves with Conflict,
Time, Photography: a shockingly
brutal awakening of the horrors of
war, and the debilitating effect of
time going by.
Conflict, Time, Photography is on
