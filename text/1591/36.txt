It’s the most, wonderful time, of the year...
Yung Nam Cheah shares her top pick of upcoming festive activities in the UK
Every Christmas holiday,
people are often tempted to go
abroad, whether to visit famous
Christmas markets or enjoy the
festive vibes of the country.
However, there is just as much to do
on this island, especially in the capital
where we are. I have scoured through
the internet for the most interesting
event and here are my top 3 picks in
London.
Fairytales After Dark
Descending to bestow Londoners
a magical weekend, the Skewbald
Theatre will be bringing fairy
tales to life at the greens of thhe
Olympic Stadium. Through an
enchanting mix of singing, dancing
and puppetry, stories familiar and
strange, of bewitched frog prince to
old Fisherman will come to life in this
outdoor theatre.
Running three times a day with free
tickets, there really is no excuse not to
escape into the classical ‘Once Upon
a Time’ world and immerse oneself
back into your childhood memories.
Tickets can be booked through the
Olympic park website and are going
fast – so don’t hesitate.

Winterville, Victorian Park
A new winter destination in London
rivalling Winter Wonderland in
Hyde Park, Winterville seems to
have everything and more. Ice rink,
checked; Fairground, check; Market
place, check; Ferris wheel, check. It
even has a Kids quarter, Pantomine
of Robin Hood, Spiegeltent and roller
disco.
Admission is free, and tickets
for various events can be brought
online (many comedies and shows in
Spiegeltent are free though!).
For those seeking refreshment,
street food stalls are scattered all over
the site, and to warm you up for the
season there is a dedicated Craft Beer
area as well.
For the party crowds there are
Roller Disco and Kicking Club nights
for you to celebrate away the festive
fever.
The only downside is that Victoria
Park is infinitely harder to get to
for us imperialites, but for those
who are a little sick of the Winter
Wonderland, it might be worth
checking out.

Burning the clocks, Brighton
With thousands of flickering lights
illuminating the streets every Winter
Solstices for over two decades,
Burning the clock parade has now
become a trademark event in
Brighton. With a parade of hand-
made paper and willow lanterns, the
festivities gather over 20,000 people
for a 45 minutes parade down to the
sea front of Brighton.
Ending in a bonfire where the
lanterns are burned and the firework
display starts, this event strives
to celebrate the darkest hours on
the shortest day of the year. To
commemorate its 21st birthday,
hidden lanterns designed with this
year’s theme ‘Urbano – the City’
are scattered across the city until
New Year (map can be found on the
website).For safety reasons, only the
lanterns made by the kit they sell can
be burnt.To join the parade with your
own handiwork, stay tuned on the
website for direction of sales (which
are yet to be released for now).
Parade on 21st Dec 18:30

Living advent Calendar
An idea that originated from
Stockholm, the living advent calendar
see a festive performance popping
out of a window or door at 18:30 from
1st to 24th December, delighting
the gathered crowd for 30 minutes.
From carol singing to dancing to
tales of folklore, each performance is
matched with a venue scattered across
the rustic town.
Whilst Henley-on-Thames is
celebrating Christmas in style for the
third year, Windsor has also joined
the bandwagon.
For those who wants to immerse in
this unique event but are discouraged
by the distance, this makes a
good alternative, although the
performance only lasts 15 minutes.

Ancient Roman festival of
Saturnalia parade, Chester
Before there was Christmas, the
people of Rome threw a festival in
honour of their deity Saturn on the
17th
December. To remember the
glory of the old days, a torch light
parade is held in Chester with Roman
legions stomping through its cobbled
streets. If merely watching the parade
isn’t good enough for you, you can
make your own lantern at Grosvenor
Museum from 17:45 till 18:30
beforehand.
