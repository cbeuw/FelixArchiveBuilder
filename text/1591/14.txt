James Bezer talks to Professor
Keith Barnham about his vision
for the future of solar energy
You originally started your career
in particle physics—why did you
change to researching solar panels?
I loved particle physics: I worked at
CERN and Berkeley and it was very
exciting at both places.
When I joined Imperial, I
spent much of my time at CERN.
Collaborations were getting bigger
and bigger and it hit me that I would
have to spend more of my time in
Geneva. We used to bring bubble
chamber film back to Imperial for
analysis, but as the beam experiments
built up, you had to spend more of
your time there. Did I want to keep
commuting to Switzerland, instead of
working and teaching at Imperial?
And how useful was particle
physics—it was fascinating, but what
practical use is was it in a world with a
lot of problems?
Photovoltaics have historically
been expensive and inefficient,
but this has improved a lot in
recent years. What technological
advances have made this possible?
It’s because of the fall in the cost of
silicon, by around a factor of four.
This wasn’t technical, though, but
political. The Germans decided to
stimulate demand with a feed-in
tariff. They hoped this would build
the market, causing mass production
and a fall in price.
That happened, but it was a big
surprise that EU and US industries
didn’t invest as much as the Chinese.
They made a political decision to
put money into big systems, initiate
mass production: that’s where the
drop in cost really came from, to the
detriment of EU production and my
own company.
You group created the most
efficient solar cells in the world.
What was novel about your design?
It’s very different technology to
other photovoltaics. Ours is based on
Gallium Arsenide semiconductors,
which most resembles the technology
in mobile phones. There’s at least
one such chip in everyone’s mobile
phone.
First you have three cells grown
on top of each other by the same
techniques used to make LEDs. The
three cells are arranged to make best
use of the solar spectrum. The first
has a very wide band gap, so it only
absorbs high-energy blue-green light.
Red and orange go through to the
second cell where they are absorbed.
Low-energy infra-red passes all the
way down to the bottom layer.
Each photon gets absorbed in
the appropriate sub-cell. It’s the
goldilocks principle: each cell is just
right for the photons they absorb.
The three cells are then put
together in series: the voltage adds up,
giving a very high efficiency of over
40%.
To make this very efficient, you
want to optimize the band gap of each
cell. Our technology, uniquely, uses
quantum wells to adjust the band
gap, by changing their depth. 50 of
them in our photovoltaics enables us
to adjust the band gap and optimize
highly efficient cells for different
spectral conditions. It’s the same
principle behind all lasers: that’s
how you make them emit different
colours.
Currently, solar cells are often
used in deserts, where there’s plenty
of sunlight. The spectrum in the UK
is very different from in the desert,
though: we have a redder sun, more
cloud and diffuse blue light. In the
future we could generate electricity
using smart windows by putting
photovoltaics on blinds. This would
have a different light spectrum again,
that we could optimize our cells to.
Ultimately it could be used with
lenses to concentrate light onto
the system, and with high enough
concentration, our technology could
be even cheaper than conventional
Chinese-made silicon devices.
With quantum wells, we can
optimize the cell for different
spectral conditions.
The whole idea is just solving the
Schrodinger equation for a square
well: the first, simplest quantum
mechanics problem we teach
to physics students and here’s a
practical application of it. What I
really like about it is that the simplest
part of quantum mechanics has
practical applications in solving
global warming.
How do your cells compare to
other technologies like plastic
electronics?
I would say they’re complimentary.
They’re all great areas that should be
researched. Ours offers three times
the energy for the same area of cells.
That doesn’t matter in the desert
because space is cheap. However,
it could be useful in applications
like replacing petrol in cars, where
getting three times the energy for the
same area is very useful. Technology
similar to ours with high efficiency
and a 25 year lifetime has proved
itself in satellites, for example, where
“If we could produce
our own, free, solar
fuel on our rooftops,
we could use it in fuel
cells to power cars.
You’d have free mileage
for life.”
"How useful
was particle
physics in a
world with
a lot of
problems?"
"It’s the
goldilocks
principle:
each cell is
just right
for the
photons it
absorbs."
