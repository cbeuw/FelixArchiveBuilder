When the Saints Go Marching In
What happens when you
put together a grumpy
old man and the next
door neighbour’s slightly, odd but
intelligent child? The grumpy man
who everyone hates at the beginning
of the film does something remarkable
for the kid, and we discover that
actually, the moody old man is a
real softie at heart. An episode of US
sitcom Modern Family finds a young
child bonding with the next door
neighbour, a retired fireman. The
mother is concerned. But he lists Gran
Torino, True Grit and Up as examples
of how things worked out in the end.
St. Vincent essentially follows the exact
same formula. We are introduced to
Vincent (Bill Murray), a loner of a man
who drinks too much, then drives, and
spends too much and is generally the
last person you would want looking
after your child. Not knowing any of
this, desperate single mother Maggie
(Melissa McCarthy), who is far too
busy at her work making a living for
herself and her son Oliver (Jaeden
Lieberher), recruits Vincent’s help…
for an hourly babysitter’s fee of
course.
Vincent’s life continues relatively
normally despite having a kid to look
after in his everyday routine. The
two of them hit the racing tracks, his
favourite bar, and Oliver even runs
into Vincent’s sort-of girlfriend who
works as a stripper/prostitute, Daka
(Naomi Watts). Daka is Russian and
pregnant, which obviously means she
is here merely for comedic purposes.
Watts makes the most out of her
limited, and ultimately pointless role,
her scenes could honestly have all
been edited out and no huge impact
would be made, and the only thing her
character contributes is some mild
comic relief due to Daka’s failure to
grasp the civilised American culture
because, you know, she is Russian in
a Hollywood production after all. It
is rare to see Watts in a role like this,
a comedic one, and perhaps this is
something she does have a knack for,
but in such a thinly written role it is
easy to overlook her contribution to
the overall narrative.
But then we discover things about
Vincent that actually portray him
in a completely different light. He
regularly visits his wife suffering from
Alzheimer’s and insists on doing all
the laundry for her. She of course
does not remember him one bit, but

his undying love for his wife helps
him persevere. He also bonds with
Oliver. Oliver is the awkward new kid
at school with bullies targeting him.
Vincent gives these means boys a
proper telling-off. Oliver and the main
bully becomes best mates in the end.
A contrived plot device that makes
little sense. Vincent is also a retired
army veteran, a fun fact that only
comes up whenever the film needs it
to. It is never used to shape Vincent’s
character as a whole.
The trouble with St. Vincent is that
it is all so painfully obvious to see
how everything will pan out. Making
matters worse in the plot overall,
is that Oliver has been assigned
homework to research into the life
of someone who he considers to be
a Saint. Given the title of the film,
guess who he is going to choose for his
project.
In all fairness, predictability matters
very little, as long as the actual content
of the bonding process between the
two protagonists does not feel too
contrived or manipulative but the
episodic, scattershot portrayal we
see here is too superficial to be taken
seriously. Vincent, in the end, is
supposed to have had a huge impact
on Oliver’s life. And for that Oliver
and Maggie are rightly grateful. But
just how on earth Vincent manages
this is never quite clearly explored.
This is why the grand finale in which
Vincent is honoured to being Oliver’s
Saint, is never quite as moving as it
should be. The film tries to make it

as heart-warming as possible, and
succeeds on some levels, but it never
quite gets across the huge crowd-
pleasing affair it wants to.
The one reason the film manages
to get by is thanks to the wonderful
performances. Murray, back in a lead
comedy role after years of being away,
is perfect for the role. Grumpy enough
to pass as a man with lots of issues,
sadness and frustration, but with
enough soft side showing through to
be an ultimately likeable individual.
It is a shame the script never does
him justice. Given that he is at the
centre of the film, it is surprising to
see how little is actually looked at
properly with him. Murray’s scenes of
interaction with the young Lieberher
are the real highlight, with the two
actors playing off each other’s talent
with excellent chemistry. There is a
bond that is established between the
two, which is why the final scene is
not a complete and utter disaster.
Another strong performance comes
from Melissa McCarthy. After a string
of roles that involved the actress
essentially swearing and shouting as
much as she could for laughs, here
we have a more intelligent character
played by a very accomplished actress.
Here is to hoping more roles like this
for McCarthy.
Ultimately it is a film let down by
a sloppy script that never bothers to
do anything decent with potentially
interesting characters played by big
names. It is pleasant enough, but could
have been much more.

The premise is a ridiculous
one, but it could have worked.
A struggling widow meets a
man who looks exactly like her late
husband. The husband’s role and
the new man’s role are played by
the same actor, so we understand
Nikki’s (Annette Bening) shock and
amazement when she accidentally
runs into Tom Young (Ed Harris),
an arts professor, five years after
the death of her husband Garret
(Ed Harris again) in Mexico. She
is hesitant at first, but eventually
decides to pursue a relationship with
him. She comes across as a complete
lunatic of course, completely breaking
down and sobbing in front of the
professor upon their first meeting,
and yet a romantic plot strand is
forced upon them, and so onto the
audience too.
Bening is without doubt at her best
when she is mourning for her dead
husband. As her character progresses,
we get hints of how mentally unstable
Nikki may be: constantly referring
to Tom as Garret, and wanting to
recapture the moments she once
shared with her husband. These acts
of desperation are sad to watch of
course, especially when so movingly
captured by Bening, but what
blossoms between Nikki and Tom is
so preposterous and farcical that it
is difficult to take any aspect of this
seriously.
Tom is essentially cast aside as a
redundant character, and the more
the film tries to make the romance
between the two work, the more
unbearable it becomes. It could have
been a sweet premise, but with such
poorly defined characters confessing
their love for one another at the most
random moments, even the coupling
of Bening and Harris cannot sell it.
It gets more interesting when
Nikki’s daughter gets involved, but
even this does not last long enough.
The late Robin Williams is in a
thankless role as the friend-zoned
neighbour of Nikki, a fellow widower.
And the less that is said about the
horrendous ending, that brings
together Nikki and Tom’s ex-wife
Ann (Amy Brenneman), the better.
