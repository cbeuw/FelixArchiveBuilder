SKETT’S BOX OF SHAME
We couldn’t spot any errors in
issue 1590, which is probably an
error in itself.
Do let us know if you could ind
any.
This week, we have spent a lot of
time investigating the death
of Stefan Grimm, a Professor
at Imperial who died at the end of
September. Although the cause of
death has never been specified, it
is chilling that his email was sent
only three weeks after he passed,
outlining what he considered to be
mistreatment from Imperial.
Various official sources tell one
side of the story, whereas only a
few, yet significant sources tell the
other. Although Felix has not seen
the original email (we were able
to recover the email list Grimm
supposedly sent the email to, but not
the email itself) there is no reason
to think the email is a hoax, or not
written by anyone else.
There are official statements
and emails from College and
the staff involved, detailing how
they offered Grimm support, or
how what happened is standard
academic procedure, but not one
source has formally apologised for
what happened. All have offered
condolences, all have carried
reassurances of investigations and
reviews of policies and all sorts of
other buzzwords that don’t seem
to have a lot of depth to them, but
no-one outright has provided an
explanation for what has been
said repeatedly as “tragic” and
“saddening.”
Felix was not able to speak
to Human Resources or
Wilkins directly, and College
Communications told us that they
themselves would be our only point
of contact. This did restrict what
questions we could ask and why,
although we were also very aware of
how sensitive this story is, and how
it is a very difficult time for those
involved. All we could do was collate
the information already released
and present the story as it stands
here, which we hope we have done
successfully.
So read the story as it stands.
Read Grimm’s email in full, and the
email Wilkins also sent. Read the
about what the wider world is saying
on Twitter and in blogs outside of
Imperial, and talk to people you know
too. Ask your lecturers, post docs,
supervisors and other colleagues not
only what they think of the story,
but how they feel about it too. The
concept of Publish or Perish is not a
new one, but this may be the first case
of Publish and Perish. Encouraging
dialogue about the underlying issues
this story highlights may also mean
that it is the last case that phrase can
be applied to.

slightly inebriated,
answers to various
drinking chants but

SURVEY TIME
(not about sex...yet)
Are you a lazy medic, or a bright biologist? Do you enjoy
living in the library, or do you ind it easy to keep the
grades high and the work hours low?
We want to know if you think your course is worth the
money you pay to study it, and how hard it really is to
get a 2.1 at Imperial.
