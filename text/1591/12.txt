One question commonly
asked of economists is “as a
member of the public, what
exactly does the economy have to
do with me?” People often feel that
as individuals, they are fighting
personal battles against household
bills or focusing on their own
consumption, rather than being part
of a larger group or society.
The reality is that the general
wellbeing of an economy has a strong
impact on every one of its members.
As individuals, we often use banks
and have an interest in companies,
which rely on the corporate system
and the financial system. In fact,
when we become involved in
the larger infrastructure of the
corporate world, we are at the whim
of the fickle nature of markets and
macroeconomic swings.
Macroeconomic issues such as
growth and inflation, as well as
the value of the local currency,
can change the lives of everybody
in the country. Low growth and
inflation can lead to banks adjusting
their interest rates, which affects
homeowners, businesses or any entity
with a bank account. Interest rates
can be volatile and can also change as
the result of monetary policy: Mark
Carney could increase the base rate of
interest of the Bank of England from
their current record low of 0.5%,
which would theoretically increase
the interest rates of high street banks.
Perhaps, however, the most direct
way in which people are affected
by the wider economy is through
their employment status. One key
problem with low growth or even
a recession is that it usually comes
with decreasing consumer spending.
Companies, therefore, tend to have
lower sales revenues and thus lower
profits during a recession. They often
scale back production by reducing
their factors of production; for many
people this means redundancy.
Unemployment is defined as the
desire to work, without having a job.
High unemployment is a
devastating thing for a developed
economy. People who are
unemployment often undergo
a hysteresis effect, where the
unemployed find it difficult to
get back into work, perpetuating
unemployment. If people continue to
be unemployed, they need training,
which can be expensive. In addition,
they take unemployment benefit
from the government, which is
the single largest expenditure by
government to date.
Economists have debated the cause
of unemployment; they often talk
of cyclical unemployment; this is
when the time of the year or another
cycle prevents a market being open,
like extra jobs around the Christmas
period. However, the real issue is
structural unemployment. This is
when the skills of the people do not

make the market structure or the
demand in the economy. As the
horse-drawn carriage lapsed into
obsolescence, many horse-carriage
drivers became unemployed. It is
vital to maintain a steady supply of
workers in order to strengthen the
economy.
Immigration can be the best
solution to unemployment. In
theory it allows a steady flow of
young, dedicated and means-tested
works to rejuvenate an economy. Is
immigration the answer in practice,
however?
This is open for debate.
What does the economy have to do with me?
