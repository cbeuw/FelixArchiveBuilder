they need every bit of power they can
get for the minimum area.
Plastic cells should be cheap, but
they too have run into problems.
Plastic efficiencies are not even
comparable to silicon. Silicon has
become very cheap now: well over
half the price of a rooftop system is
installation. The other problem that
plastic has is that it doesn’t last as
long as conventional PV systems.
The Chinese intervention is great
news for first generation silicon
cells, as it has driven down the costs
enormously, but bad news for my
company and for plastic electronics.
Although we had efficiency, our
investors decided to sell us to an
American conglomerate, because we
just couldn’t produce the technology
cheaply enough to compete with the
Chinese.
Do you think that using
sunlight to produce fuels has a
complementary role alongside
other photovoltaic technologies?
We’ve seen already that electric
cars can be powered by silicon
photovoltaics: there’s enough
sunlight to power a car for an average
domestic mileage.
But that means the car can only be
used when the sun is shining.
What you really want to be able to
do is store that much energy from
highly efficient photovoltaics on the
roof of your house that match the
electricity needs of your house, plus
some extra to power a car.
The obvious way to store it is as
fuel.
There’s enough sunlight hitting
a rooftop to capture carbon dioxide
and turn it into methanol. Hydrogen
is easier to make, and buses run on
it already, but I think for home use,
methanol would be better because it’s
safer.
The American Physical Society
thinks it can’t be done, but I refute
their pessimism. Firstly: nature does
it pretty well. Plants do it to make
sugars with about 2% efficiency, but
I think it should be possible to do it
better, as there are lots of physicists
and engineers looking into exactly
this.
There’s a group at ETH Zurich
working on nanostructure filters.
They take in carbon dioxide through
the filter at room temperature and
heat it up to 90°; this then desorbs
the CO2 letting you store it at
concentrations up to 99% . In the
next couple of years, we’ll be able
to use this technology to produce
methanol with CO2 straight from the
atmosphere.
Chemical engineers are working on
an electrochemical cell, which uses
photons to produce hydrogen. You
can do it easily by shining light on
catalysts to speed up the reaction.
If we could produce our own, free,
solar fuel on our rooftops, we could
use it to power cars. You’d have free
mileage for life.
Is solar power really reliable
enough to use as our main energy
source?
The Germans did a very important
experiment in 2007 called
Kombikraftwerk. It took the
equivalent electricity demand of a
small town and met 100% of it with
renewables at all times. It showed
that over a year, 70% of German
demand could be met by wind and
photovoltaics, with 25% from biogas
and only 5% from storage.
The output from nuclear power
stations has to remain constant: day,
night, summer, winter.
As I discuss in my book, wind
power output in the UK is, on average,
much higher than in Germany. If
the test were run here, around 78% of
demand could be supplied from wind
and photovoltaics.
There’s also another very
important point against nuclear
power.
Offshore wind and PV are rising
faster than mobile phones did when
they first took off. If you extrapolate
it, we could have far more PV and
offshore wind than nuclear by the
time the new Hinckley Point turns
on. If we do what we can do with PV
and wind, nuclear will be a complete
irrelevance, but only if we invest in
subsidies for renewable rather than
nuclear.
Does your house have
photovoltaics?
Yes! I’m extremely pleased with them.
This point about what happens when
the sun doesn’t shine: our excess
(and we often have it) is stored in our
hot water tank. Between March and
October, we don’t use gas: all or hot
water comes from excess solar. So the
message that you will sometimes hear
that we can’t store solar energy except
at great expense is completely wrong.
Another point is that we have it
on an East-West side. It generates as
much as if it were ideally positioned
on a south facing roof. We’re actually
saving even more on our electricity
bill, because the sun is shining more
often when we’re using it.
In the future, concentrated
photovoltaics could track the sun
throughout the day, so you always get
the maximum light intensity on the
solar panels. I calculated that using
concentrators with high efficiency
cells, we could generate around 90%
more energy over the year.
I’ve also signed up to Good Energy,
an all-renewable electricity supplier.
All our excess power goes back to the
grid, which I can borrow back later.
If you can’t get a rooftop system,
switching to Good Energy is a good
thing to do.
"It's the
simplest
problem in
quantum
mechanics
and here's
a practical
application
of it."
"Offshore
wind and so-
lar cells are
rising faster
than mobile
phones did
when they
first took
off."
