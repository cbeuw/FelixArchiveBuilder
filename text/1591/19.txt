Have you ever wondered if
there is a program that
can simulate the whole
observable universe (and even
beyond)? Well, step forward Space
Engine. It has been in the works
since 2005 and is the beautiful
and complex brainchild of Russian
astronomer and programmer
Vladimir Romanyuk.
The concept of the software
is that you can go to wherever
you want in space and explore
planets, moons, stars, nebulae,
other galaxies and more without
the need for the most expensive
astronomical imaging equipment.
All observed astronomical objects
are implemented; even the most
recently discovered distant stars
and exoplanets. But it doesn’t stop
there. Instead of an invisible wall
ultimately set by the limitations of
our current technology, it randomly
generates objects meaning that there
are literally billions of galaxies to be
explored; each containing trillions
of star systems and thus even more
planets and moons.
However, Space Engine isn’t just
about objects just whizzing about
in space. You can travel at any
speed through space and time. This
means, for example, you can watch
the sunrise (or lack thereof) at any
point on any planet. Each body
has its own in-game wiki telling
you almost everything you need
about it. Using this data it can
then simulate whether the planet
(or moon) is suitable for life, be it
organic or some unknown exotic
variety. This is the most enjoyable
aspect of the software for me; you
can click on any star in the sky, fly
over to it in seconds and explore
its planets. It tells you whether
these planets harbour life – from
simple floaters on gas giants to
complex multicellular beings on
some unlikely candidate hosts. You
can then go and see what the planet
looks like on the surface. Some are
deserts, some are ocean planets and
some are rocky and very earth-like.
It is just fascinating to potter around
these unique environments and see
what life could be like elsewhere.
On the subject of uniqueness,
despite looking through hundreds of
planets so far I have not found two
that look the same. Most planets are
gas giants of course, but even they
come in different colours and in
different sizes. I’ve seen Earth-like
bodies with beautiful pink clouds,
some with many, many moons
and even a moon harbouring life
with a Saturn-like ring system (see
picture). Even though the absolute
majority of these systems are just
randomly generated simulations,
there is something very satisfying
about just browsing star systems and
finding your own relic of a planet
– something someone hasn’t found
before.
This is just the tip of the iceberg
of the capabilities of Space Engine.
Being free to move in time means
one can observe the configuration
of star systems at any point. This
is fortuitously very useful to me in
my masters project this year. Whilst
observing the magnetic field around
Saturn, it has proved very useful to
know where its moons are relative
to the Cassini probe which is doing
the measuring. This software allows
me to type in the desired time and
it will instantly depict what the
universe looked like at that point to
the nearest hundredth of a second.
I would go as far to say that Space
Engine is probably the best piece of
software that you’ve probably not
heard of. Although technically not
a game, I still think that this would
appeal to most people (especially
Imperial students!). It is in beta
stage right now and is thus free to
download from en.spaceengine.org.
If you enjoy it and want to help it
carry on there is a link to donate.
If you’re computer has a semi-
decent graphics card (or failing that
it is possible to install on university
computers… I checked), download
Space Engine now and lose yourself
in the universe which we call home.

Yep, you can also go down to planets' surfaces and feast upon the beauty!! Photo: Space Engine, Jamie Dutton
Steam Greenlight
of the week
Flying is one of the things that
is absolutely amazing, but is rarely
successfully realized in games.
However, in Air Brawl we have
what looks like a good attempt.
This multiplayer title has a heave
focus on dogfighting on tight,
mazey maps. It definitely looks
interesting and currently you can
vote for this game on Greenlight.
