Subject: How Professors are
treated at Imperial College
Dear all,
If anyone is interested how
Professors are treated at Imperial
College: Here is my story.
On May 30th’13 my boss,Prof
Martin Wilkins,came into my
ofice together with his PA and
ask me what grants I had.After I
enumerated them I was told that
this was not enough and that I
had to leave the College within
one year–“max”as he said.He
made it clear that he was acting on
behalf of Prof Gavin Screaton,the
then head of the Department of
Medicine,and told me that I would
have a meeting with him soon to
be sacked.Without any further
comment he left my ofice.It was
only then that I realized that he
did not even have the courtesy to
close the door of my ofice when
he delivered this message.When
I turned around the corner I saw
a student who seems to have
overheard the conversation looking
at me in utter horror.
Prof Wilkins had nothing better to
do than immediately inform my
colleagues in the Section that he had
just sacked me.
Why does a Professor have to be
treated like that?
All my grant writing stopped
afterwards,as I was waiting for
the meeting to get sacked by Prof
Screaton.This meeting,however,
never took place.
In March’14 I then received the
ultimatum email below.200,000
pounds research income every year
is required.Very interesting.I was
never informed about this before
and cannot remember that this is
part of my contract with the College.
Especially interesting is the fact
that the required 200,000.-pounds
could potentially also be covered
by smaller grants but in my case a
programme grant was expected.
Our 135,000.-pounds from the
University of Dammam? Doesn’t
count.I have to say that it was a
lovely situation to submit grant
applications for your own survival
with such a deadline.We all know
what a lottery grant applications are.
There was talk that the Department
had accepted to be in dept for some
time and would compensate this
through more teaching.So I thought
Stefan Grimm’s email, taken from dcscience.net:
that I would survive.But the email
below indicates otherwise.I got
this after the student for whom I
“have plans”received the oficial
admission to the College as a PhD
student.He waited so long to work
in our group and I will never be able
to tell him that this should now
not happen.What these guys don’t
know is that they destroy lives.Well,
they certainly destroyed mine.
The reality is that these career
scientists up in the hierarchy of this
organization only look at igures
to judge their colleagues,be it
impact factors or grant income.
After all,how can you convince
your Department head that you
are working on something exciting
if he not even attends the regular
Departmental seminars? The aim is
only to keep up the inances of their
Departments for their own career
advancement.
These formidable leaders are
playing an interesting game:
They hire scientists from other
countries to submit the work that
they did abroad under completely
different conditions for the Research
Assessment that is supposed to
gauge the performance of British
universities.Afterwards they leave
them alone to either perform
with grants or being kicked out.
Even if your work is submitted to
this Research Assessment and
brings in money for the university,
you are targeted if your grant
income is deemed insuficient.
Those submitted to the research
assessment hence support those
colleagues who are unproductive
but have grants.Grant income is
all that counts here,not scientiic
output.
We had four papers with original
data this year so far,in Cell Death
and Differentiation,Oncogene,
Journal of Cell Science and,as I
informed Prof Wilkins this week,
one accepted with the EMBO
Journal.I was also the editor of a
book and wrote two reviews.Doesn’t
count.
This leads to a interesting spin to the
old saying“publish or perish”.Here it
is“publish and perish”.
Did I regret coming to this place?
I enormously enjoyed interacting
with my science colleagues here,
but like many of them,I fell into the
trap of confusing the reputation of
science here with the present reality.
This is not a university anymore but
a business with very few up in the
hierarchy,like our formidable duo,
proiteering and the rest of us are
milked for money,be it professors
for their grant income or students
who pay 100.-pounds just to extend
their write-up status.
If anyone believes that I feel what
my excellent coworkers and I have
accomplished here over the years
is inferior to other work,is wrong.
With our apoptosis genes and the
concept of Anticancer Genes we
have developed something that
is probably much more exciting
than most other projects,including
those that are heavily supported
by grants.
Was I perhaps too lazy? My boss
smugly told me that I was actually
the one professor on the whole
campus who had submitted
the highest number of grant
applications.Well,they were
probably simply not good enough.
I am by far not the only one who
is targeted by those formidable
guys.These colleagues only keep
quiet out of shame about their
situation.Which is wrong.As we
all know hitting the sweet spot in
bioscience is simply a matter of
luck,both for grant applications
and publications.
Why does a Professor have to be
treated like that?
One of my colleagues here at the
College whom I told my story
looked at me,there was a silence,
and then said:“Yes,they treat us
like sh*t”.

Dear Stefan
I am writing following our recent
meetings in which we discussed
your current grant support and the
prospects for the immediate future.
The last was our discussion around
your PRDP,which I have attached.
As we discussed,any signiicant
external funding you had has now
ended.I know that you have been
seeking further funding support
with Charities such as CRUK and
the EU commission but my concern
is that despite submitting many
grants,you have been unsuccessful
in persuading peer-review panels
that you have a competitive
application.
Your dedication to seek funding is
not in doubt but as time goes by,
this can risk becoming a dificult
situation from which to extricate
oneself.In other words,grant
committees can become fatigued
from seeing a series of unsuccessful
applications from the same
applicant.
I am of the opinion that you
are struggling to fulil the
metrics of a Professorial post at
Imperial College which include
maintaining established funding
in a programme of research with
an attributable share of research
spend of £200k p.a and must now
start to give serious consideration
as to whether you are performing at
the expected level of a Professor at
Imperial College.
Over the course of the next 12
months I expect you to apply and
be awarded a programme grant as
lead PI.This is the objective that
you will need to achieve in order for
your performance to be considered
at an acceptable standard.I am
Wilkin’s email to Stefan Grimm, as taken from THE
On page 6, read what Academic peers had to say of the emails
committed to doing what I can to
help you succeed and will meet
with you monthly to discuss your
progression and success in achieving
the objective outlined. You have
previously initiated discussions
in our meetings regarding
opportunities outside of Imperial
College and I know you have been
exploring opportunities elsewhere.
Should this be the direction you
wish to pursue,then I will do what I
can to help you succeed.
Please be aware that this constitutes
the start of informal action in
relation to your performance,
however should you fail to meet
the objective outlined,I will need
to consider your performance in
accordance with the formal College
procedure for managing issues of
poor performance (Ordinance D8)
which can be found at the following
link.http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/
secretariat/collegegovernance/
provisions/ordinances/d8
Should you have any questions on
the above,please do get in touch.
Best wishes
Martin
