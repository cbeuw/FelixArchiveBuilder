THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 45
FELIX

Records tumbled at the
first inter-university pool
tournament of the year as a
new-look Imperial team pulled off
some stunning wins and overcame
bad luck (and hangovers) to earn
their first ever medal in the Southern
England Univesities Pool Council
Team Shield event. The team set
off early Saturday morning from
Paddington, and spirits were high
as we made the arduous journey
towards sunny Weston-Super-Mare.
With three new members to the
team, team captain Rob had some
head scratching to do in the run up
to the tournament as to how to field
his eager players, using the journey
to make sure all were up to speed on
tournament rules and regulations.
We arrived at the venue with
time to spare, and as Rob went off
to the captains meeting, the team
looked at the schedule to discover
the identities of their opponents
in the first round of individuals
tournament. After some waiting
around, the matches began and the
three new members, Aaron, Charles
and Linus all managed to see off their
first-round opponents with ease (with
Aaron defeating a University College
London (UCL) 1st
s team member,
point 1 to Imperial), while Captain
Rob proved his own worth to the
team by crashing out in spectacular
fashion, along with the President
of the society, Cheng “so good they
named him twice” Cheng. In the last
sixty-four, the standard of play was
much better and both Linus and
Aaron were defeated in extremely
tight matches, with Aaron playing a
sloppy frame to hand his opponent
victory. However, Charles was making
a great first impression on his debut
university pool tournament and
steamed through to the next round
with some unbelievable play and
a touch of alcohol induced luck. A
winner’s medal was not to be though,
as in the next round he faced a very
handy player from Southampton
who had previously dispatched the
Snooker and Pool win irst medal in Shield
3rd
seed for the tournament. With his
opponent blatantly stealing Charlie’s
patented “drink between the shots”
method, the dye was cast and Chaz
was sent packing. However, he can
hold his head high with an excellent
debut performance.
Next up was the team event, with
our group made up of UCL 1st
s,
Oxford 2nd
s and University of East
Anglia 3rd
s. First up was Oxford,
and after racing into a 4-0 lead with
some fine play from Aaron playing
at number 1 and Charles at number
3, we were pegged back to 5-4 to set
up a tense finalé. Captain Rob finally
(in his second outing) showed some
mettle and took the winning frame
to give us a 6-4 win and a great start
to the tournament. Next up were
UEA 3rd
s, and a much less dramatic
match ended with us as runaway 6-1
winners, with Aaron the only player
in the team winning every frame
so far, something he frequently
mentioned to his teammates to help
their spirits. With play over for the
day, the team played some friendly
Aaron Brown and Robert Hughes report as Snooker and Pool win their irst
medal at the Southern England Championships
frames with other universities and
made excellent use of the cider and
Guinness stocked bar to let off some
steam.
Sunday arrived, and the team made
its way to the tables for a London
showdown of epic proportions.
With the last UCL – Imperial match
ending at 6-1 to us, UCL were out for
revenge. Charles and Aaron were up
first, and after Charles lost a very
tight game (against a player who
finished 4th
in the overall singles
tournament), Aaron brought it back.
1-1. Linus followed, and another
tight frame went UCLs way. 2-1. Each
team continued to trade frames until
UCL took the advantage when they
managed to inflict a first loss on
the “mighty” (to use his own words)
Aaron, a “massive” (again his words)
blow. 5-3 was the score with both
Rob and Cheng needing to win their
frames to avoid defeat.
It was not to be, and UCL managed
to convert their lead to a 6-3 win,
meaning that after starting the day
as top of the group, Imperial dropped
to 3rd
place based on frames conceded
and head-to-head. This meant that
we qualified for the Team shield
event, and our next match was against
Southampton 2nd
s, a very worthy
opponent. Another no nonsense
performance from the team and we
finished 6-3 winners, with Rob tying
up the match with a simple (although
he strongly claims it wasn’t) black.
The semi-final was upon us, and
with it came a very winnable match
against Essex 2nds. A shocking
start to the match, which saw both
the dependable Aaron and Linus
throw away their frames and
Essex race into a 2-0 lead. Rob and
Charles then brought it back with
some tidy play and we were right
back in it at 2-2. Unfortunately
the team then fell apart, with easy
frames slipping through our fingers
and we eventually lost 6-3. While
disappointed not to reach the final,
the entire team can hold their heads
up as they bring home the first
Imperial pool team medals of the
season (and ever).
