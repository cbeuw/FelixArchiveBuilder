Guy Bourdin’s Glamour: Sinister, Surreal & Sexual
Elizaveta Tchebaniouk is enchanted by the photographer’s dark inner visions
"Bourdin
created
the perfect
dream-like
atmosphere,
captivating
the viewer
with its
strangeness"
Somerset House unveiled the
UK’s largest ever exhibition
of Guy Bourdin’s work, which
spans the 40 year career of the French
photographer, and features not
only his most iconic photographs,
but also never before seen material
including Polaroid test shots,
double-page spread layouts, contact
sheets, as well as Bourdin’s paintings,
poetry, Super-8 films, and sketches.
In content and title – Guy Bourdin:
Imagine-Maker – the exhibition shows
Bourdin as not simply a fashion
photographer, but also an artist, and
portrays his unique craftsmanship
and perfectionist approach.
The exhibition begins with Walking
Legs – a series of photographs
Bourdin took in August 1979 for
a Charles Jourdan advertising
campaign. His approach was most
unconventional; the campaign was
shot in locations on a road trip from
London to Brighton which Bourdin
had taken in his Cadillac, and
featured no model apart from a pair
of mannequin legs cut off just below
the knee. Despite being simplistic
due to the absence of the model, the
photographs nonetheless convey
a most elaborate type of dramatic
narrative which is characteristic of
Bourdin’s photographs.
The main upstairs gallery features
a collection of large iconic Bourdin
photographs from Vogue Paris,
among unpublished ones, all hung
in quadruplets. Bourdin had a large
collection of film books where a
single movie could be “viewed” still
by still, and such an arrangement
pays homage to that. Each quadruplet
is much like a collection of movie
stills from a film noir, which tells a
loosely related narrative. A girl lies
face down on the floor, naked, while
scarlet paint leaks from her mouth.
Another girl makes a phone call from
a booth, all the while in front of two
pairs of legs which appear to be lying
limply on a sand-pile, with the torsos
leaning out of view. Two models lie
in a bed, a pile of sauerkraut and
sausages before them; one girl eats a
sausage with one hand, while giving
the other girl a sausage with the
other. All these appear to be unlikely
ad campaigns, and yet they were
commissioned by high-end clients
such as Vogue Paris, Pentax calendar,
Versace, and Charles Jourdan.
Bourdin’s sought after photographs
were revolutionary in that they
gave glamour a surreal and sexually
sinister hue, and that is why the
fantasy they depicted captivated and
mesmerized their audience.
In another room are four screens
which play segments of Bourdin’s
unique Super-8 short films,
accompanied by music. Suddenly,
one is transported to an atmosphere
of Wes Anderson-like dreamy
melancholy the very opposite of the
sinister and surreal one sensed in the
previous gallery. Watching a French
maid dance with a trouser-less man
in a blazer and dress-shirt is a most
refreshing and charming experience.
Bourdin was revolutionary not
only in his content, but also his
approach. There was a precise science
to his art – nothing was accidental,
but the product of a meticulous
process. Unlike his contemporaries,
Bourdin would submit a ready layout
indicating the precise placement of
his photographs to the magazine
publishers. Examples of Bourdin’s
layouts and contact sheets are
showcased in the exhibition, as well
as polaroids of landscapes which
Bourdin took and marked with black
tape to focus in on a particular area
that interested him as a possible
background. Similarly, it is worth
noticing that the photographs
exhibited in quadruplets in the main
gallery are all slightly different sizes
– Bourdin purposefully adjusted
the widths and length when editing
to achieve the focus which was most
perfect for the subject and content of
each specific photograph.
Bourdin would also surprise his
contemporaries by eagerly accepting
assignments of shoe and accessory
advertising campaigns, normally
given to more inexperienced
photographers due to their
constraints. Bourdin, on the contrary,
felt the tight boundaries of such
narrow focus did the opposite – they
provided him with the space for
creative freedom, and the ability to
experiment within the boundaries.
An example of such campaign is
shown in the exhibition in a room
solely dedicated to Bourdin’s
photographs for a shoe advertisement
campaign, which were taken of two
models in a hotel room, and clearly
shows Bourdin’s mastery in creating
such novel diversity out of a simple
setting.
Another room of the exhibition
displays something most surprising
and unexpected of a conventional
fashion photographer – his paintings,
and thus Bourdin continues to prove
"Guy
Bourdin's
photos
convey
a most
elaborate
type of
dramatic
narrative"
to be an artist beyond his being
established as a fashion photographer.
The subjects and motifs which are
present in the paintings are paralleled
in some of Bourdin’s photographs,
and these are displayed alongside.
Unlike the photographs, most of
the painting which are exhibited are
unfinished, showing traces of reworks
and alterations. Even the finished
paintings are neither dated nor
signed.
Bourdin created the perfect dream-
like atmosphere which captivates
the viewer with its strangeness. A
sense of the unexpected and the
artificial are central in Bourdin’s
photographs – in them, he engineered
a surreal and dark world. The
staged world is personal to the
viewer – the mind of each fills in
the story of the fantasy, and that is
perhaps how Bourdin’s photographs
subconsciously and indirectly create
desire, and sold the product. But there
is a deeper significance behind the
advertisements; much like Bourdin’s
beloved film noirs, his photographs
offer an unexpected escape from the
familiarity of reality – one catches a
glimpse, for a brief moment, of the
rich and strange world as Bourdin
saw it.
Guy Bourdin: Image Maker is on at
Somerset House until 15th
March 2015.
Tickets are £9 adults; £7 concessions.

Bourdin, will be held on 11th
