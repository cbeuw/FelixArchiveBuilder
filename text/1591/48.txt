Imperial Basketball make
strong start to the season
Half-way through the season,
and everything is extremely
bright for Imperial College
Basketball so far! The teams which
entered the British Universities &
Colleges Sport (BUCS) leagues have
been performing outstandingly.
The Men’s 1st
team tops its league,
and is still undefeated (just like the
Philadelphia 76ers, only the other
way round). The Women’s 1st
and
Men’s 2nd
teams are respectively 4th
and 2nd
in their league.
We’ve also enjoyed a great turnout
to our weekly Saturday development
sessions, where students get to work
on their individual skills and learn
fundamental offensive and defensive
moves. Michael Wells, Development
Sessions Secretary, reflects on this:
“Here in development sessions, we
have two primary goals: to improve
our basketball skills, and to have
fun! Our sessions are usually split
into two sections: the first forty-five
minutes consist of warm-ups and
different drills that serve to improve
a different area each week. For the
rest of the session, we run games of
either 4v4 or 5v5, full court, where
we try to incorporate the various
things we have learned each week”.
In addition, with ICU Basketball’s
fast expansion, we may potentially

and Jules Bianchi – the
World Sport Column
Cricketer Phillip Hughes was
laid to rest at his funeral in
his hometown in Macksville,
New South Wales, on Wednesday.
Australian captain Michael Clarke
gave an emotional eulogy after acting
as a pall bearer. Hughes, who would
have turned 26 on Sunday, was struck
by a bouncer last Tuesday, and died
on Thursday afternoon, after an
artery burst in his neck. The Test
Series between Australia and India
has been subsequently rearranged.
Adelaide, Hughes adopted home
ground, will now host the first test,
with Brisbane hosting the second. A
twitter hashtag, #putoutyourbats, has
become a global phenomenon, with
many leaving their bats outside with
a cap on the handle in tribute.
Last week Brendon McCullum,
wearing a PH (Phil Hughes) on his
shirt, became only the second player
in history after Don Bradman to score
two double centuries and a triple
century in a calendar year.England

start a third Men’s team next season.
So everyone is welcome to join the
sessions, whether or not you would
like to join the teams!
Finally, may I take this opportunity
to invite everyone that may be
interested to our Winter Basketball
Tournament (you do not have to be
a member to come and play). This
will take place at Ethos on Saturday
13th
December from 14:00 to 17:00,
and it will be good fun. There is no
requirement regarding how skilful
you are basketball-wise, just make
sure you bring some enthusiasm!

Taekwondo emerge victorious
for second year running
The 10th
anniversary of the
Imperial College Taekwondo
society got off to an explosive
start over this past weekend, with
the hosting of the third annual
Imperial College Open Taekwondo
Competition.
The competition has grown at an
incredible rate since its inception in
2012, this year attracting upwards of
230 competitors from 31 universities
across the United Kingdom.
This represents the most substantial
increase in competition turnout
so far, and solidifies the Imperial
College Open as the second largest
student Taekwondo competition
in the country, and the largest such
competition planned and run by
university students.
The massive increase in turnout
and scale has provided a significant
challenge for members of the
Imperial College Taekwondo team,
many of whom acted as volunteers
and helpers, in addition to taking part
in the competition itself.
Despite these considerable
challenges, Imperial College
Taekwondo once again emerged from
the competition victorious, winning
a total of 23 medals (8 Gold, 4 Silver,
11 Bronze) from a pool of 29 fighters,
narrowly defeating the substantially
larger 37 strong University College
London Taekwondo team and
ensuring that the ‘Imperial Award’
for highest cumulative medal score
remains at Imperial College for the
second year running.
For the past three years, the
Imperial College Open has grown at
an increasing rate, and is likely to
continue to grow in the future.
The organisational challenges of
such a competition are immense and
could not be possible without the
incredible degree of support received
from the Taekwondo community.
Imperial College Taekwondo would
therefore like to thank Master
Ali Abdoli in addition to Stephen
Butlin, Danut Varzani, Tameem Al-
Kubati and Maniesha Kaur for their
assistance in officiating the fights.
We would also like to thank Master
Reza Saberi, Estefania Palacios,
and Christopher Dancel for their
instruction and coaching, both on
the day and during the lead-up to the
competition itself.
Finally we would like to thank
the BSTF for their support in the
organisation of the Imperial College
Open; the ESSA for their sponsorship;
and Image Scotland for their
provision of materials and clothing
for the competition.
Imperial College Taekwondo hopes
to build on the success of the past
three years, with a bigger and better
competitions in future.
