RCSU Science Challenge 2015 launches
On Monday, 100 students
gathered in the Sir Alexander
Fleming Building for the
launch of the Science Challenge 2015.
The Science Challenge is an annual
competition that is open to Imperial
College London students and school
students across the country, often
drawing in hundreds of entries over
the course of the competition.
The Science Challenge judges this
year again included high profile
members of Imperial staff and
communicators from outside of
Imperial, each of which set their own
title for students to either write an
essay on, or for one judge, make a
video to address.
The Science Challenge is currently
entering its eighth year, and judges in
the past have included Pallab Ghosh,
former Felix Editor and current
science correspondent at the BBC.
Two of the four judges were present
at the event. Sue Gibson OBE, a
Professor of Chemistry at Imperial,
and Philip Moriarty, a Professor
of Physics from the University of
Nottingham attended and introduced
their titles for their essay and video
submissions.
Unfortunately two of the essay
judges could not make it. Mun Keat
Looi, a science writer and editor, had
to take his partner to the hospital,
while Ruth Whincup, the Imperial
Hub Manager, was ill. She was
represented at the launch by Fatima
Iftikhar, the President of Imperial
Hub.
The questions, as announced on
the night, include “Tell me a story
about science”, contributed by Mun
Keat Looi, and “What would you like
to discover, and why?” which was
Professor Sue Gibson’s question.
Ruth Whincup contributed the last
of the three essay questions: “How
do we inspire the next generation to
take an interest in STEM research?”
A video question, submitted by
Professor Philip Moriarty asks “Why
should I believe a scientist?” Essay
submissions should be 850 words
maximum, and the video entry
should be up to three minutes.
There are two different categories
of prizes for the essays - the Overall
Winner (as will be decided by Lord
Robert Winston, Ambassador for the
Science Challenge) will win £1000
and a shadowing internship in the
House of Lords, while each Question
Winner will win £400.
There are two different submission
streams for the essay competition

- one each for Imperial College and
Schools submissions. The video, for
which there is only one submission
stream, will have a £500 prize for the
Overall Winner, while the Runners-
Up from Schools and Imperial will
win £200.
Essays and videos can be submitted
at any time until noon on the 28th
February. Finalists will be contacted
on the 15th March, with the Final
held at the Luncheon Room in Inner
Temple on 23rd March, 2015.
June Yin Gan, Science Challenge
Chair, said of the launch: “It was
a successful evening overall, and
everyone who came told me that
they enjoyed themselves immensely.
I hope people have as much fun
making their entries as I had
organising it!”
Serena Yuen, current president
of the RCSU said, “The Science
Challenge Launch has once again
been a fantastic occasion, and one for
the RCSU to be proud of.
“I very much hope that those
who attended found the talks as
interesting as I did, and that everyone
at Imperial is looking forward to
entering this year’s competition.
“I’d like to thank all of our fantastic
judges for volunteering their time
for the Science Challenge, and for
everyone who helped out in preparing
the Launch and the rest of the
competition.
The final is looking to be a fantastic
night.”

Too few people turn up to Union’s General Meeting
The General Meeting took place
Monday evening, but with only
45 people showing up, failed to
meet quorum. The General Meeting,
proposed by Imperial College Union
Council member Andrew Tranter,
aimed to finalise the Union’s stance
on education funding and formalise a
Higher Education Funding Policy to
reflect this.
For the meeting to make quorum,
200 people need to show up within
the first half an hour of the meeting,
all of whom could then vote on any
proposed motions. Despite Council
itself having 50 members, with only
49 people turning up, no motion
could be passed and the policy will be
taken back to Council and discussed
in next Tuesday’s meeting. Only then
will the policy be finalised.
Despite not meeting quorum,
discussion surrounding fees carried
on for a further two hours, and the
meeting came to an end at around
8.30 pm. Only one person was
allegedly seen to be sleeping during
the entirety of the meeting.
Initially it was decided by
Council last academic year to hold a
referendum addressing four options
for funding education: for education
to be free, for there to be a graduate
tax, to pay tuition fees or none of the
above. However, this referendum was
replaced by the Higher Education
Funding survey set and assessed
by Alex Savell, the current Deputy
President (Finance and Services).
Tranter proposed in the last
Council meeting that a General
Meeting should be held to discuss the
Higher Education Funding Policy,
and come to a decision that hundreds
of students could potentially all agree
upon as opposed to Council deciding
alone using the results of the survey.
The results were presented in the
General Meeting, despite not meeting
quorum.
Tranter also introduced two papers
to be considered at the meeting: one
to install a policy supporting Free
Education (regardless of the survey
outcomes), and another to introduce
annual General Meetings, to be held
in the second term of each year. Since
the Meeting failed to meet quorum,
both of these papers were not passed.
During the meeting, Savell
recapped the results of the survey that
closed earlier last week. 310 students
filled in the survey, just under 2% of
the current student population. Out
of those that completed the survey,
87.7% were undergraduates.
Although Free Education garnered
the most support, it wasn’t by a large
majority; 140 students said Free
Education would be the funding
model they would ultimately want,
whilst around 90 students said they
would prefer Tuition Fees. Just under
than 40 supported Graduate Tax, and
just over 20 weren’t a fan of any of the
models.
Savell’s results were highly
comprehensive and looked at the
survey responses from various
standpoints, showing the complexity
of the student opinion concerning the
debate. Savell therefore proposed a
policy that instead of supporting one
particular line of funding, will look
at several components of funding as a
whole instead.
This includes campaigning for
a regulation on Postgraduate and
Overseas Fees, alongside campaigning
for a reduced privatisation of the
Higher Education sector as a whole.
In terms of funding, Savell proposed
that the Union should campaign for
reduced tuition fees, as “this is what
aligns best with the largest number
of student views and appears to be
antagonistic to the views of the fewest
respondents.”
Paul Beaumont, Union Council
Chair, was pleased with the meeting
as a whole. He told Felix that “Whilst
not quorate, the students who did
attend engaged fully and it was
brilliant to hear their (wide ranging)
views. I think that because there is
such a diversity of viewpoints on
this issue it is important we listen to
them all and then try and work out a
stance that reflects that - this General
Meeting went some way to achieving
that.
“It looks like the new policy is going
to take a middle-ground approach (as
opposed to the previous one passed in
2011), which will hopefully be more
inclusive of the membership’s views.
This can only be a good thing.
“I’d like to thank those who came
and got involved, and the DPFS for
his hard work on the initial proposals
and ground work for the policy.”
