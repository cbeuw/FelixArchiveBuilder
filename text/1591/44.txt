Building a Cleaner Future
The forum’s third year sees its
growth to an even bigger event,
keeping up with the pressure of
climate change itself.
Movements for equal rights over
the years have been pushed forward
by the vibrant culture of university,
be they for women’s rights, gay
rights or the battle against racism.
In each case there have been huge
steps towards change, so it seems only
logical to approach students once
again with the problem of climate
change.
This was a point made by Michael
Mathres, one of the many esteemed
guest speakers who made their way
down to the London Climate Forum
at Imperial College London for an
incredibly informative day that
served to enlighten us on what exactly
we could do to make a difference in
what sometimes seems like a hopeless
situation.
The day began with a keynote
speech by Professor Sir Brian
Hoskins, Chair of the Grantham
Institute, followed by talks
emphasising the importance of design
in innovation for sustainability. After
a networking opportunity at lunch,
the forum split off into two branches.
The UK Youth Climate Coalition
held a workshop that boiled down to
‘telling your story’, a fundamental
concept at the heart of every
environmentalist, or aspiring one.
People from all over the world
shared their stories. A lake in a small
community, their dependence on
this lake, the lake’s part to play being
washed away by climate change: all
summed up in a moving speech from
one voice in the room whose story of
her own home left all in silence.
A bridge from the bustling
discussion of climate change to
the story of one person’s home
was powerful enough to make a
crowd listen intently and incite a
meaningful discussion about change.
And that’s what is so special about
the forum now. We are at a university
which reaches out to every corner
of the world for its students, so it is
imperative to acknowledge this for
such a worldwide issue.
Reaching across the world to
Borneo, the concurrent event was a
film screening of Sunset over Selungo.
The film highlighted the issues faced
by the Penan tribe and their struggles
against the logging of their jungle
home. With home swiftly becoming
a recurring theme, I spoke to fellow
Earth Science student Sarhan Abdul-
Samat, from Borneo himself, who
told me “I think that it is a very real
reflection of how minority groups
in Malaysia are usually treated and

fuel the wealth gap between those in
power and those who are victims of
it.”
The afternoon talks in the Great
hall commenced with Michael
Mathres of World Climate Ltd who
launched the hall into an active
discussion via his global campaign
to get students involved with Road
to Paris 2015, an effort which he
hopes will result in a global deal
with businesses from the private and
public sectors contributing positively
to UN climate negotiations.
The series of talks to follow
involved linking environmental
law to the water rights of people in
India, or working on improving the
outlook of a very specific community
such as Maputo, Mozambique using
sustainable self development to
make a difference, rather than from
the perspective of ‘changing’ the
entire world. Alex Kirby, a former
BBC environmental correspondent
who has now set up the Climate
News Network, explored the media’s
involvement which he believes
is fading, and could possibly be
reignited by a “benign catastrophe” to
unite our generation, which is the last
that can make a difference.
Talks such as these are essential at a
science university like Imperial, and
having the opportunity to hear these
speakers give a very deep and specific
insight into climate change puts our
lives into perspective and provides
us with the potential and attitude to
actively make a change in the future.

NAC, Hacks, and Blacksmiths
Another week,another issue!
Following the excitement of last
week’s‘Mascotry Issue’,we have
an article on the London Climate
Forum.In other news:
The New Activities Committee
(NAC) met on Tuesday this week
to discuss various new clubs,
societies and projects.Look out for
events from Airsoft,Nepali and Lib
Dem Soc (among others),which
have been put into the New Club
Incubator.Iranian Society have also
been re-established as a society with
a new committee.
Anthony Crowther,the Student
Activites Manager,is leaving
Imperial College Union this week
to start a new job with the Careers
Service at Goldsmiths.For the
interim weeks without a Student
Activities Manager (the Union would
quickly fall apart!),Yas Edwards,last
year’s DPCS,will be returning to
assist with the transition.
Finally,I received an email from
Owen Leech this week,who hopes
to establish a Blacksmithing
society at Imperial–if this sounds
interesting,drop him an email at
owen.leech14@imperial.ac.uk.
We are always on the look out
for new stories and ideas–if you
think you have something to
contribute,get in touch at felix.

The next society to hit Imperial? Let us know! Photo: Jeff Kubina
