Rugby Club launches petition for club captain
500+ students have signed to oppose the Union’s motion of no conidence
ICURFC have launched an online
petition that has already amassed
500 signatures at the time of press.
The petition, to show support for the
Club Captain, Thomas Hobson, who is
currently at risk of losing his position,
was launched yesterday and has been
signed by students, clubs and societies
as a whole.
The petition follows Imperial
College Union announcing that
a motion of No Confidence
will be held against Hobson at
Union Council next Tuesday
(9th December). If the vote of no
confidence is passed, he will be
relinquished of his role of Club
Captain, and an election will take
place to find his replacement.
This follows the incidents Felix
reported on in November when
rugby players were seen stripping
on tube platforms after returning
from a match on the 29th October.
The disruption caused by the players
resulted in a district line tube service
being suspended. Passengers were
told to disembark from the train at
Ravenscourt Park station after being
told that there was a “signal failure”.
The individual players involved
are now under investigation by the
British Transport Police, who have
footage of them drinking from
bottles of wine on the tube and being
completely naked on several tube
station platforms.
The motion of No Confidence
will be presented to the members
of Union Council, and only those
that hold a seat on Council will
be able to vote for or against it. It
is being brought against Hobson
as he allegedly lied during the
investigation into what exactly
happened on the tube. The motion
of No Confidence was one of the
sanctions decided upon by the
Governance Committee of the
Union, which includes members of
the Trustee board.
The other sanctions included a
club-wide two-week suspension for
ICURFC, a suspension from the club
for those on the match sheet of the
day of the incident until the end of
the year, and for those on the match
sheet to also undertake community
service.
The Athletics Clubs Committee
(ACC) held a meeting last week,
where the members of committee
present unanimously voted to
support Hobson, despite the reasons
behind calling for the vote of
No Confidence. This will also be
presented to Council at the meeting.
In an email to Presidents, Club
Captains and Club Chairs that
are overseen by the ACC, Oliver
Benton, ACC Chair, details how the
members of the committee voted
to “support [Hobson] through this
vote of no confidence” alongside
the distribution of the petition,
which is garnering support from a
diverse range of students including
those not involved with ACC. Many
other clubs have also distributed the
petition to their respective mailing
lists.
The email also lists how the
ACC believes that “[Hobson] acted
with the best interests of his Club
members at heart.” The email also
notes that the team has “already
been punished by the Union as a club
and as a team”.
It has also been suggested that
many sports teams will be showing
up at the Council meeting in a show
of solidarity for Hobson, although
they will not be able to vote on the
motion.
Tom Wheeler, Imperial College
Union President, said in regards to
the petition: “The reason for [the
motion of No Confidence] is that the
Club Captain lied repeatedly to both
myself (as part of the investigation
Photo: Felix
that I was carrying out on behalf of
the Governance Committee) and
the College Tutors. These mistruths
were only brought to light when the
British Transport Police corrected
us (with the backing of witness
statements and CCTV footage).
“The fact that this dishonesty
is not given as the reason for the
motion of no confidence in the
online ICURFC Petition indicates
that the only reason for the petition
is the belief that the Club Captain
was acting in the best interests of
the Club and its members, however,
by acting in a dishonest manner the
Club Captain achieved the opposite.”
"The
motion...
was one
of the
sanctions
decided
upon"
Tom
Wheeler:
"The
reason...
is that
the club
captain lied
repeatedly"
