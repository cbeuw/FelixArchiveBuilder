Grimm passed away months after being sent “ultimatum email”
An Imperial professor who died
“suddenly and unexpectedly”
in September has allegedly
sent a posthumous email to his
colleagues, with the subject line: “How
Professors are treated at Imperial
College.”
Professor Stefan Grimm, aged
51, from the Department of
Toxicology within the Faculty of
Medicine, died in late September.
An email from an account, named
professorstefangrimm@gmail.com,
was then sent on October 21st.
An Imperial spokesperson said that
there was no reason to believe the
email was not genuine, and we have
republished the email in full on the
right.
The email was sent to around 40
internal Imperial email addresses,
including senior members of the
Faculty of Medicine. It details how
Grimm was told he would have to
leave College after not securing
enough research funding.
Grimm had previously published
over 70 papers covering cell signalling
and anti-cancer genes in high-impact
journals during his career, alongside
two books and several review articles.
Grimm describes in his email that
this was a case of “publish and perish.”
The email was sent three weeks after
colleagues were informed of his
death on the 29th of September from
Martin Wilkins, Head of Department
of Medicine and Grimm’s boss.
Grimm describes how Wilkins told
him that although he had submitted
the highest number of grant
applications, and despite already
acquiring £135,000, he had to obtain
a total of £200,000 all in one go in the
form of a programme grant to remain
working at Imperial.
The email outlines how Wilkins
told Grimm in May 2013 that he
would have to leave Imperial within
the year if he didn’t acquire enough
funding. Wilkins then sent him
an “ultimatum email” in March of
this year, constituting “the start of
informal action” against Grimm. This
email has since been published in a
follow-up article on the Times Higher
Education website, and we have
republished it below
Wilkins stated in the email that
he expected Grimm to succeed in
securing a programme grant as lead
Principal Investigator (PI), and would
have to achieve this within 12 months
“in order for [Grimm’s] performance
to be considered at an acceptable
standard.”
Grimm goes on to state in his email
how “this is not a university anymore
but a business… with very few
profiteering and the rest of us being
milked for money.
Wilkins says in his email to Grimm
that he is “committed to doing what I
can to help you succeed and will meet
with you monthly to discuss your
progression and success in achieving
the objective outlined.”
He goes on to say to Grimm that
“You have previously initiated
discussions in our meetings regarding
opportunities outside of Imperial
College and I know you have been
exploring opportunities elsewhere.”
“Should this be the direction you
wish to pursue, then I will do what I
can to help you succeed.”
Following the email, Nigel Buck,
Operating Officer for the Faculty of
Medicine, sent two similar emails
to those internal and external to the
College who received the email.
Buck’s emails do not address the
legitimacy of the email from Grimm,
nor its contents, but does say that
the death is under investigation
by statutory authorities, and that
Stefan’s death came as a “great shock.”
Felix has been unable to confirm
his cause of death, but has been told
that the West London Coroner’s
District adjourned an inquest into his
death on October 8th. It is unknown
when they will reopen the inquest and
when the exact cause of death will be
made public.
Felix was told last week, prior to the
publication of Grimm’s email, that
College is currently reviewing the
relevant “policies and procedures”
and present the findings in a report
by a group of senior College staff.
The Director of Human Resources
accompanied by the Senior Consul,
Professor Richard Thompson, is
leading the review.
A college spokesperson said that
“Contrary to assertions elsewhere,
Professor Grimm was not under
formal review nor had he been
given any notice of dismissal. It is
standard practice in higher education
institutions to conduct both
informal and formal performance
management.”
“In this tragic case, the process was
at the informal stage.”
“His line manager met with him
on a number of occasions to see how
the College could help him to develop
more competitive grant applications,
for example through internal peer-
review, collaborations and letters of
support.
This is in line with requests
from funders of research to ensure
applications are of sufficient quality
to be considered.”
Professor James Stirling, Provost
of Imperial College London, said:
“Imperial seeks to give every member
of its community the opportunity
to excel and to create a supportive
environment in which their careers
may flourish. Where we become
aware that the College is falling short
of this standard of support to its
members, we will act.”
Grimm’s email initially surfaced on
a blog written by David Colquhoun, a
University College London emeritus
professor of pharmacology, who hosts
dcscience.net. He was forwarded the
email from associates at Imperial.
He states on his blog: “No doubt any
Imperial staff member would be in
great danger if they were to publish
the email.”
Said Colquhoun about his blog post,
“This bullying has been going on for
years, and it is more prevalent than
it used to be. The message to Grimm
was not to do more research, but that
you mustn’t do cheap research.”
“I think there should be a petition
set up for a public inquiry into his
death, and ask what the authorities
are going to do about it.”
“It just seems Imperial are doing
their best to whitewash it. They rarely
get to the heart of the matter.”
