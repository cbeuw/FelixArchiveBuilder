A personal look at psychological abuse
An anonymous writer’s personal experience with emotional
abuse and the warning signs
At a friend’s house party last
week I met a couple that
brought back a few memories
I had hoped to keep locked up, and
now, huddled next to the radiator
in my otherwise arctic flat, I try to
write this for what seems like the
hundredth time. I want to write about
emotional abuse, its warning signs,
and illustrate this all with my own
experiences because looking back
now, I feel like had I known what
it was that was happening to me, I
would have got out of there much,
much earlier.
You don’t often hear people talk
about emotional abuse, and in part,
I think this is because sometimes
neither the victim nor the abuser
know it’s happening. Emotional
abuse is a series of harmful, repetitive
behaviours that slowly chip away
at the victim’s sense of self worth
and independence, making them
dislike themselves. I, unfortunately,
have experienced first hand what
it’s like to be in a relationship with
a manipulative and emotionally
abusive person, and am living proof
of how it can mess you up and leave
you a mere shadow of what you once
were. This is my story.
When I first started dating my
then partner, I was a fairly confident
person but he soon found a way to
find my every insecurity and dig at it
until I felt so horrible about myself
that I no longer wanted to be alive.
He was the first boyfriend I’d ever
had – having come from a strict
religious family, I wasn’t allowed to
date. This meant that from the get-go,
I had to hide my relationship from
my parents because I was convinced
they wouldn’t understand, and
that was the first thing I did wrong.
Initially, he insisted he wanted to
keep our relationship a secret from
our friends, because he wanted it
to just be between us, because that
would make it ‘more special’. The
thing about manipulators is that they
isolate you from others, and do it so
subtly that you don’t often notice it
happening until it’s too late. We’d
been dating for almost a month until
he decided to tell our close friends
in halls, and that was after another
friend of mine had expressed a desire
to go out with me, an offer that I had
denied. My boyfriend decided that it
was time for people to know, because
he didn’t want anyone else to think
I ‘wasn’t his’. That should have been
the first red flag. What emotionally
manipulative and abusive people do
is try and make you so dependent
on them by isolating you from your
friends and family that you start to
believe they have some sort of claim
on you, and worse, that you want
them to have a claim on you.
Next came the ruining of my
self esteem – it started subtly at
first, as these things do, with small
comments here and there. He would
mock me in front of our mutual
friends under the guise of ‘flirty
banter’, try and counter my every
point in group conversations and
often cut me off when I would try
and speak. When I would tell him,
in private, that his actions were
making me uncomfortable or upset,
he mock me for being over sensitive,
tell me to toughen up and learn to
take a joke and that he didn’t mean
to offend me. When we would go
out with a group of people that I
didn’t know, he never made any
effort to introduce me as anything
but his girlfriend, and by that
point, he had whittled down my self
confidence enough that I did not
want to participate in conversations
anymore in fear of being mocked or
cut off. As time went by, it started
to get less subtle. Whenever I would
tell a joke, he would tell me that it
wasn’t witty and would dismiss it,
and then repeat later in a different
group taking credit for it. A couple
of times, I called him out on it,
but he would claim that I was just
misremembering it and he had come
up with it on his own. He made me
doubt myself so much that I couldn’t
trust even my own memory after a
while. Now, these are all clear signs
of emotional abuse, when someone
makes you doubt yourself so much
that you no longer trust your own
memory, there should be warning
signs going off in your head.
Whenever I would mention that I
had a problem with how he treated
me, he would twist my words to
make it seem like I was being needy,
or childish, and make me feel
like I was overreacting. He would
make sure that I knew he was a great
boyfriend by buying me presents, and
constantly bring this up in arguments
to make sure I never forgot that
he obviously loved me and that I
shouldn’t put him under so much
stress when I know he’s so busy with
work. He would refuse to speak to me
until I apologised for overreacting.
If you’re with someone who makes
you think that the emotions you’re
feeling due to something they’ve done
are in some way unjustified, then
that person is not worth being with. I
cannot stress this enough, it doesn’t
matter what the other person meant
by their comments or actions, if you
feel unsafe and bring this up, and
they then constantly try and make
you feel bad for feeling offended and
refuse to apologise, then they’re not a
very nice person.
Now, he was never physically
abusive towards me and honestly
it might have made it much easier
to get out of that relationship if he
had been. We’ve somehow been
conditioned to think of physical
and sexual abuse as being the only
‘legitimate’ types of abuse, which
means it cost me three years and
my mental health before I realised
that something was amiss and that it
wasn’t just me overreacting. Now, half
a year later, after months of therapy
I’ve slowly come to notice the signs
and just wish someone had told me
about them sooner. So I guess that’s
what I’m doing now. If any of these
situations seem familiar to you, then
it might be worth thinking long and
hard about your relationship (be it
with a partner, parent, or friend).
Thank you so much for sharing your
experiences with us. Please remember
that if you’re feeling under pressure, talk
to someone. Don’t suffer in silence. –
