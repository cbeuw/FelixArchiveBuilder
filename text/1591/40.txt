Hundreds of students legitimately sign
unsecured online petition
Hangman is pleased to report
this week that, for once,
Imperial students have
seemingly rallied together and
displayed a sense of political prowess.
Over 600 students, clubs and societies
and even some sabbatical officers and
senior members of staff have signed
the ACC Rugby petition.
The petition was posted online
earlier this week in a bid to record
support for their Club Captain that is
facing potential expulsion from his
role.
The petition, in its sheer brilliance
and simplicity, allows anyone with
any Imperial login to sign up, and
students from every edge of campus
and beyond have been apparently
queuing up to show their support.
No password or email confirmation
is necessary; you can enter almost
random combinations of letters and
numbers and they will manifest
themselves into a codified Imperial
login and add another signatory to
the petition that is growing on the
hour.
Hangman spoke to Iraqi Soc,
who despite having seemingly no
recollection of signing up, did say
they enjoyed rugby as a sport. Said
the President: “Yes, I have watched
this sport once or twice on TV. Did I
sign up? I guess if it says I did, then
yes, I must have done. Why would
a petition feature names if they
didn’t legitimately support what the
petition was about?”
Hangman also spoke to the natural
allies of ACC Rugby, ICU Feminist
Society, who had also signed the
petition with their club email. Said
the President, “I have seen these
boys drink in the Union once or
twice, and, to be honest, I think their
lad culture is actually damaging in
encouraging sexism at Imperial. But,
if it says someone entered my login,
then I guess we do in fact support the
team.”
Alice Gast, Robert Winston and
also the CGCU Spanner have also
penned their support of the team,
An unprecedented 15,000 students turn up to
General Meeting
AGeneral Meeting was held
this week to discuss the state
of commercial services at
Imperial, and approximately 15,000
students turned up. The Meeting was
called to discuss, in no particular
order, the lack of air conditioning in
the library, the mice that are often
spotted running around the cafes
on campus, having to pay to get into
the Union and, a point apparently
thrown in for good measure “The
Imperial Ratio.”
The number of students that
turned up was unprecedented, and,
as such, the Union had to set up
a number of live streams of the
discussion across campus, with
students willingly piling into lecture
theatres across campus on a Monday
evening to have their say about the
issues that truly mattered to them.
With a General Meeting only
requiring 200 students to meet
quorum, the number of attendees in
this case meant quorum was met a
record breaking 45 times over.
The discussion started at half seven
on Monday evening, and continued
well into the night as reasoned
debate turned into impassioned
deliberation. At 1am, armed services
turned up to provide blankets,
liquids and other supplies for the
students who showed no sign of
tiring in complaining about the heat
on Level 4, the hygiene of the library
café, and how one in five students
still leave Imperial as virgins.
Said one mathematics student sat
in Blackett lecture theatre 1: “I just
don’t understand why the President
of College spends so much money on
getting us stuff like flying robot labs
or whatever but won’t even pay for
more desk fans or anything.
“I literally have to take shower
breaks during revision in the
summer if I can only find a seat
on the 5th floor.” Several hundred
people nodded in agreement, and
tens of people were heard to cheer.
A Biologist sat in the Great Hall,
which had the discussion streamed
through to a giant screen on stage,
said: “What I don’t get is how every
year I vote in that guy who promises
no more entry fees on a Friday, and
yet every year I find myself paying
£2.50 to enter Metric and listen
to some guy play a shitty itunes
playlist to an empty stage.” Applause
then followed for a deafening ten
minutes.
Many were also congregated on
Queen’s Lawn, with another last
minute projector displaying the
debate on the side of the Queen’s
Tower.
During a particularly robust
debate on point 222.1.6b, “All the
decent looking girls do Biology,”
one EIE student said “I wish I had
been told that you actually have to
develop interpersonal skills whilst
at boarding school before coming to
Imperial.
“Apparently demanding girls to
make me sandwiches and calling
it banter doesn’t really make girls
find you attractive, but it took me
nearly all of first year to come that
conclusion.” A rare moment of
silence followed this statement, one
of the few of the Meeting, as people
seemed to quietly consider what he
said.
The meeting finally came to the
end Wednesday evening, as people
slowly left lecture theatres, seminar
rooms, cafes and meeting rooms
and moved towards Beit Quad to
queue up for ACC Sports night. As
they were leaving, many spoke to
Hangman and said it was good to
get the stuff that bothered them out
into the air like the whole entry fees
thing, but one student did say “It is
£9.50 to get in, which is annoying,
but I guess we do get four pints.”
with all their email logins appearing
on the petition. It also seems the ICT
service desk, the library complaints
team, those behind hiring the
Union minibuses and even Robert J.
Carpenter have been moved by the
plea to protect the rugby player, with
their email logins present on the list.
When Hangman contacted Tom
Wheeler, Imperial College Union
president, we asked him why he had
both signed the petition and also was
one on the panel that called for the
motion of no confidence in the first
place. He seemed perplexed, again
unable to recall signing the petition
with both his personal login and the
presidential account, but did say
that “You can’t really argue with an
automated list like that, can you?
“I am not a fan of the petition as I
think the individual needs to accept
the consequences of his actions, but
then my name is on it twice so it
must mean I doubly support ACC
Rugby too.
“It is confusing, as it now seems I
simultaneously disapprove and also
highly approve of the petition, but
why would my name appear on it
twice if that wasn’t the case? No-one
would dare troll such a sophisticated
sign up system, would they?
The crowds also extended down Exhibition Road, as thousands showed up to the GM to make their voice heard
