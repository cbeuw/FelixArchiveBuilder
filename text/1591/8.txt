Imperial raises £54.2 million from donations
On the 25th of November,
Imperial College London
hosted a Thank You Reception
in celebration of the record-breaking
number of donations made to the
College during 2013-2014. Part of
the donations, which totalled £54.2
million, went towards funding 110
undergraduate scholarships through
the President’s Scholarship Fund,
which consists of a £3,000 reward.
The fund also supported the Imperial
College PhD Scholarship Scheme,
which cover full tuition fees as well as
additional financing for three and a
half years.
During the year, 5,403 donors gave
money for research and scholarships.
President Alice Gast hosted the
event, along with other Imperial
staff and students. During a welcome
speech, President Gast remarked that
support for university education had
never been more important than
now, placing an emphasis on the need
for people to be able to problem-solve
and think critically to address the
dynamic problems we face today. She
said: ‘Today’s world demands new
leaders, critical thinkers, fresh ways
of approaching persistent problems,
and innovative ways of handling the
new problems that arise. This is what
we do here at Imperial – we develop
thinkers and leaders, we extend
knowledge and develop solutions.
And we can do all this only because of
your continued support – the support
of our donors.”
The President’s Scholar, 4th year
physicist Oliver Clipsham, also spoke
of the benefits of the scholarship
scheme at the event. He said: “On
behalf of myself and all the scholars
here at Imperial, I would like to offer
my heartfelt thanks that you have
donated to ensure that more students
may go on to have a similarly
wonderful experience.”
The event also saw the launch of
the 1907 Circle, which recognises the
people and organisations who donate
£5,000 or more to Imperial. Those
who are members of the Circle are
given a lapel pin in commemoration,
a personal report giving a break down
of the impact of their donation, and
an invitation to every special event
hosted by President Gast. Last month,
more than 80 people joined the Circle.
The evening saw the Queen’s
Tower Rooms transformed into an
exhibition hall, with interactive
stands presenting information about
the cutting-edge research taking place
at Imperial.
Alumni from around the world
descended on campus to attend the
event. Dr. Michael McCann, who did
a PhD in Electrical Engineering at
Imperial in 1963, visited from the
US. He has supported scholarships
at the College for a long time, and
his motivation for donating stems
from the importance of education in
building a successful career.
He said ‘My PhD has been
the key to everything I’ve done
professionally.”
Charity Week raises in excess of £80,000
Charity Week, a fundraising
event ran by Imperial College
Union Islamic Society (iSoc)
earlier this month, managed to raise
£83,401.70, breaking all previous
records the club held.
The week, spanning from the 29th
November, included a black tie
dinner; an auction; an intersociety
quiz; a girls-only pampering and
fashion day; volunteers trekking up
Snowdon; and an inter-uni football
competition. iSoc also ran daily
cupcake and doughnut stalls across
campus, and door to door bucket
collections.
The auction alone raised £30,000;
one rainbow cake baked by fifth year
Medic Junaid Masud was sold for
£3,800 after a bidding war between
members of the iSoc committee and
the Muslim Medics Society. After
driving the price so high, the two
groups decided to group together
and pay in total, making this cake
potentially the most expensive cake
ever bought (allegedly).
The finale of the week was a talk
by Dr Yasir Qadhi, which was held in
the Great Hall. Tickets were sold for
£20 each, and the event made a profit
of £15,000, which was all donated to
charity.
Charity Week is not unique to
Imperial; many Universities across
the world run events too.
The international total for Charity
Week was £732,571.47, and this will
be donated to various projects that
the volunteers will have a chance to
vote for.
President of Islamic Society,
Ibtesham Hossain, said that:
“Charity Week never fails to get
everyone together, the money
raised is astonishing, the work put
in is astonishing and the reward is
astonishing.
“I genuinely believe we are only
just scratching the surface in terms
of what we can achieve through this
campaign; the potential of each and
every volunteer has no limits and, for
this reason, Charity Week at Imperial
will continue to prosper”.
Alex Savell, Deputy President
(Finance & Services), said: “We
are incredibly proud of all the
achievements our many clubs
and societies make, but Islamic
Society have really done something
incredible this year.
“Sitting in our office, we’ve seen
how diligently and enthusiastically
they’ve been working towards this
and I’m personally extremely happy
for them that it’s paid off in such a
spectacular way.
“It’s brilliant that a society here are
raising and giving such a large sum to
such a good cause.
“I hope student organisations at
Imperial College Union and all other
institutions continue to do such good
deeds”.
