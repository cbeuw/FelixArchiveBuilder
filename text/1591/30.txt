Revealing the Reality of Campus Rape

Something of a small revolution
is taking place at Columbia
University. Each day, Emma
Sulkowicz, a 21 year old 3rd year
student can be seen carrying her 23
kg mattress around campus. It’s not
that she’s found a drastic solution
to tiredness at lectures; but rather a
powerful performance art piece. Carry
That Weight is Sulkowicz’s final year
thesis in which she vows to carry the
mattress on which she was assaulted
until the man she says raped her is
removed from campus.
The piece itself, even removed
from her story, is powerful. It brings
to mind Tracey Emin’s My Bed, now
being exhibited at the Tate Modern.
The two pieces, quite aside from the
obvious superficial similarities share
a confessional element; Emin’s piece
was designed to open up dialogue
about mental illness and preserved
the artist’s bed as she had left it after
suffering from a nervous breakdown;
Carry That Weight aims to throw light
on rape and sexual assault across
college campuses. Sulkowicz’s gesture
is especially powerful as so often
victims of sexual violence remain
silent because they are afraid of the
stigma they face in talking about
their experience. “In my case, I was
raped in my own bed’, Sulkowicz told
Democracy Now host Amy Goodman.
“[My rape] desecrated one of the most
intimate and private places of my
life and the way that I’ve brought my
story from a place that I keep secret
out into the public eye sort of mirrors
carrying the mattress out into the
light for everyone.”
Women who have been raped often
say that they feel branded as a victim
or, worse, a liar out to ruin a man’s
life, when they speak out about their
past. Sulkowicz is no exception. When
she revealed her story as part of her
thesis, she too faced stigma. Writing
for TIME she said “I’ve lost friends
because some people just don’t
understand what it means to be raped.
One friend asked me if I thought that
my rapist would be expelled from
school. I said, “I really hope so.” And
he said, “Poor guy”.”
She may have lost friends, but
Sulkowicz has also gained a wide
group of supporters. Part of her
performance is following a set of
‘rules of engagement’ that include
allowing herself to be helped in
carrying the mattress if someone
spontaneously takes it up with her
(though she cannot ask for help) – a
deeply symbolic and literal gesture.
Indeed Sulkowicz says that she has
garnered so much support that
she hardly ever needs to carry the
mattress alone, someone invariably
helps her to carry it from class to
class.
On 29th
October, No Red Tape,
Carry That Weight, and Student-
Worker Solidarity organised an
international day of protest. The
protest saw students across 130
campuses – from Stanford University
to Central European University
in Budapest – carry mattresses in
support of Sulkowicz; demonstrators
at Columbia University dumped
28 mattresses outside the home of
Columbia President Lee Bollinger, in
the hope of showing that ‘the ball was
in his court’ to take up proceedings
against the student who alledgedly
raped Sulkowicz and two other
women.
Performance art and political
movements have always been closely
intertwined. The hacktivist group
Anonymous wore Guy Fawkes
masks to protest police brutality in
the killing of the killing of Michael
Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In
London in 2011, a performer lay
naked on the floor of the Tate
Britain’s Great Hall splashed with oil,
emulating a bird caught in a oil spill
in protest against the Tate accepting
sponsorship from BP.
It is yet to be seen whether Carry
That Weight will have a political
impact; almost three months after
Sulkowicz started carrying her
mattress around, her alleged rapist
still remains enrolled at Columbia.
Following the October protest,
students at Columbia were charged
$471 for ‘clean-up’.
In America, it is estimated 1 in
5 women are assaulted in college,
and the picture doesn’t look much
better on this side of the pond; In
2010, a study by the National Union
of Students found that one in seven
women experienced a serious physical
or sexual assault during their time as
a student. Speaking to The Telegraph
in May of this year, Sarah Pine, Vice
President for women at Oxford
University Student Union, says that
in the last year alone she’s heard
just under 50 stories of rape from
female students whilst working for It
Happens Here, the student led Oxford
University organisation that aims to
raise awareness about sexual assaults
at university.
Earlier this month, The White
House launched It’s On Us a new
campaign aiming to raise awareness
of issues of sexual assault and rape.
It is hoped that by bringing more
attention to the unsavoury reality
of these crimes, whether through
government projects or the bravery
and eloquence of people such as
Emma Sulkowicz, that sexual assault
can be eliminated from university
campuses.
Editorial: The
Debate Issue

SECTION EDITORS
If war is the engine-driver of
history,then surely art is the
same for debate.What else can
promote discussion,outrage,and
intrigue like art can? From the
long-running controversy stirred
up by the annual Turner Prize,to
the innumerable think-pieces,
springing up like mushrooms
after a rainstorm,every time Tate
purchases are particularly risible
work.
In this issue of FelixArts we are
looking at how art and artists can
stimulate debate,adding fuel to
the ire of popular opinion.We
start off with Emma Sulkowicz,a
21 year old artist who is carrying
her mattress around Columbia
campus until her rapist is expelled.
Indira Mallik looks at this powerful
protest,and links it back to other
pieces of performance art that
double as protest.
We then move on to have a look at
the TateModern’s latest exhibition,
Time,Conflict,andPhotography,in
which the lasting legacy of war
is explored through the work
of photographers.They use the
camera to excavate the past,and
look at the effects that warfare can
have today; it is seriously powerful
stuff,compounded by a seriously
smart curatorial twist that sees us
moving away from the moment of
the event.
But not all debate needs to be
about misery; Guy Bourdin,
the fashion photographer who
revolutionised the industry,created
a vast amount of debate with his
bold,loud,sensuous depictions
of high fashion.Elizaveta
Tchebaniouk heads down to
Somerset House,where the most
extensive retrospective of his work
is currently being held,to ind that
underneath the glamour and glitz,
there is a dark,surreal heart.
Finally,we take a look at Her
NakedSkin,a play about the
suffragettes that ran this week
at Guildhall School of Music &
Drama; taking this as a starting
point,we take a look at the history
of women writers in theatre.
Despite centuries of progress,for
women playwrights,the British
theatre industry is still stuck in
the dark age,passing over their
scripts in favour of their male
contemporaries.
With this issue of FelixArts,we
want to achieve what all great
works of art are able to do: stir up
controversy,provoke debate,and–
perhaps most importantly–make
you think.
