How Reddit made it okay to hate women
Last week I wrote in Felix about
‘GamerGate’, a loosely defined
movement nominally about
“ethics in video game journalism”. In
the article I outlined how really the
movement is about harassing women
online.
But GamerGate wasn’t created
when some developer was accused
of sleeping around: it’s the latest
manifestation of a long history of
online misogyny. Specifically, the
kind that’s become the accepted
norm in certain dark corners of
popular forums like Reddit and
4chan.
Let me start by saying that Reddit is
a very large and diverse website, with
forums for every topic imaginable,
and people from all walks of life.
You want a forum (‘subreddit’) for
science? Game of Thrones? Horror
stories? All this and more awaits you!
4chan, on the other hand, is less
welcoming. It’s notorious for being
a vile place, where anonymity allows
people to be quite cruel. It’s perhaps
less surprising that 4chan has become
a haven for online misogyny, but
Reddit’s a different case.
Reddit has a dark side, and it’s a
big one. For example, after nude
photos of several (female) celebrities
were leaked a few months ago, users
set up a subreddit dedicated solely
to uploading and sharing these
photos. The subreddit was banned
eventually, but only due to a flood of
legal notices – not out of any sense
of decency or empathy for those
affected.
In fact, in a blog post, CEO Yishan
Wong defended his principles by
saying “we consider ourselves not just
a company running a website where
one can post links and discuss them,
but the government of a new type of
community.” Coincidentally, these
principles are the ones where he gets
to keep the lucrative, coveted images
available on his site.
Wong is essentially saying that
people should be free to discuss
anything they believe in a legal
sense, but also in the sense that
any viewpoint should have an
opportunity to reach any audience.
So, for example, if bigots want to
talk to each other about bigotry, the
admins of Reddit don’t see it as their
responsibility to step in. If Reddit is a
government, it’s a libertarian one.
They claim no responsibility for the
subreddits’ content, but still provide
the ‘real estate’ and association with
the known Reddit brand to these
people. This leads, worryingly, to
examples like the /r/WhiteRights
subreddit, with thousands of openly
racist users.
The feminism subreddit, /r/
feminism, provides a more
interesting example: how was the
moderator selected? Simple: someone
saw that there was no /r/feminism,
and registered themselves with the
admins as a moderator. That was the
end of his involvement with the paid,
official Reddit staff. After that he
had carte blanche to do anything he
wanted with the “/r/feminism” brand.
This particular moderator is
controversial because he has made
some arguably highly anti-feminist
statements. So what can feminists
on Reddit do to make the subreddit
a safer space for them? Nothing,
pretty much, which might have
surprised them – it’s easy to be
fooled into thinking Reddit is more
administrated and less user-run than
it really is.
Of course, there is some
‘government intervention’. Any
subreddit that attracts too much bad
media attention gets banned quickly.
You can also get banned for exposing
the identity of other Reddit users. So
the admins ware happy to intervene,
but only when the website traffic is
jeopardised.
A bigger problem, though, is that
you get subreddits that turn into echo
chambers for some nasty stuff, most
notably the infamous /r/TheRedPill.
It’s shocking how bad /r/TheRedPill
is in contrast to the profile and
overall niceness of so much of Reddit,
but what’s more shocking is how
popular it is – it claims over 85,000
users! Not the biggest subreddit by
a long shot, but not insignificant
either. What exactly is it?
Named for the classic scene in
The Matrix where Neo swallows the
‘red pill’ to discover the hidden
truth about reality, /r/TheRedPill
claims to present its users with the
‘truth’: that feminism was created by
women to control and manipulate
men, and that it’s really men who
are oppressed in our society. It’s
a stupid, demonstrably false idea,
obviously, but these people take it
dead seriously.
Just browsing through the front
page, threads like “Women are not
what you expect them to be”, “women
are children” and “the deregulation
of the sexual marketplace” (in case
you’d forgotten that libertarianism
obsession of theirs) are the norm.
This forum basically conditions men
to treat women as prizes and to be
wary of their ‘tricks’ and deceit.
Let me be clear: this subreddit isn’t
an outlier. There’s an even bigger one
called /r/MensRights, which claims
to be a safe space for men to discuss
issues affecting them, but seems to
mostly exist to criticise feminism.
(Top thread as of writing? “Can We
Try To Focus on Men’s Rights, not “I
Hate Feminists!” jokes?”)
The denizens of these forums
will deny it, but it’s actually pretty
uncontroversial: both of these
forums are hate groups, no different
to /r/WhiteRights, and Reddit has
approved and sanitised them. They’ve
also given them the tools they need

COMMENT WRITER
"Reddit has a
dark side, and
it's a big one."
to communicate, organise, advertise,
associate, and persuade, and they
profit from doing this. If you like,
here’s the Tweet-sized summary: on
Reddit (and our old pal 4chan), hatred
of women is accepted and in many places
expected.
Again, I stress, a lot of Reddit isn’t
like this. If you just hang out in /r/
TwitchPlaysPokemon you won’t
see any of this. If you really love
gardening, 95,000 other people do
too! Go hang out on /r/Gardening!
And, of course, people from
TheRedPill and MensRights will
deny accusations of misogyny.
But this is precisely Reddit’s
problem – these echo chambers
warp the users’ perspective on what
constitutes ‘misogyny’ so much that
they don’t see their own hatred. And
then, despite the problems they’re
causing, Reddit still claims to be
mainstream and open to all. After all,
in its slogan it claims to be “the front
page of the internet.”
With this safe space for misogyny
(again, 4chan’s role can’t be
understated), is it any surprise
that harassing women online has
become so organised? Something like
GamerGate was inevitable, it just
needed a nucleation site like the Zoe
Quinn accusations. Viewed from this
perspective, it’s clear that our society
still has a long way to go.
Thanks to Joseph Henderson for helping
me write this by providing many details
about how Reddit works.
