Postgraduate Loan System announced
Astudent loan system has
finally been introduced
for postgraduate study.
The decision, announced in the
Chancellor’s Autumn statement,
is said to “revolutionise’ access to
postgraduate university courses.
The government-backed loans will
be introduced for the 2016 to 2017
academic year, ready for students
who started university undergraduate
courses after 2013. It is expected that
the funding will allow an extra 10,000
students to pursue a master’s degree,
although the loan is only available to
students under the age of 30.
The total cost for the loan over the
first four years is £1.5 billion, and
the loan will have an interest rate,
repayable at 9% of earnings above
£21,000. The loans will be available
across all subject types, not just for
science, technology, engineering
and medicine degrees as has been
previously suggested in government.
The treasury has cited an increased

demand for high-skilled labour and
an increase in social mobility as
reasons for the introduction of the
loan, but also expect that those who
take out the loan will be making
enough money after completing the
degree to pay it back.
“The loans are designed so that,
on average, individuals will repay
in full, in recognition of the high
private return to individuals, but
they will beat commercial rates. The
government will consult on the detail
and will confirm the delivery plan,”
the Treasury says.
Mr Osborne said in statement in
the House of Commons: “A year
ago, I abolished the arbitrary cap on
the total number of undergraduates
at our universities. Today, I am
going to revolutionise the support
for our postgraduate students too.
Until now there has been almost no
financial support available, and the
upfront costs of postgraduate degrees
deter bright students from poorer
backgrounds.
“So today, across all disciplines,
we will make government-backed
student loans of up to £10,000
available, for the first time ever, to all
young people undertaking postgrad
master’s degrees.”
However, there may be a downside
to the loans.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies has
assessed that the loans may result
people losing 50% upwards of their
salary to cover total repayments when
also considering income tax, national
insurance costs and undergraduate
repayments too.
The loans have been designed
to ensure that, on average, they
will be paid back in full alongside
undergraduate loan repayments,
compared to the undergraduate loan
which only one in two students will
pay back in full.
Previously, costs for postgraduate
courses have had to be covered by
Career Development Loans, savings
or scholarships.
CDLs only allow you to borrow up
to £10,000 so often cannot cover both
the living costs and the tuition costs
for postgraduate study and have to be
paid back regardless of employment
status after graduation, making them
a high-risk payment option. Chancellor George Osborne made the announcment Photo: BBC

Grimm’s story: academics react online
@MichelValstar:“Having
worked at Imperial as a PostDoc,
I recognise the vile atmosphere
portrayed here (via @david_
colquhoun).“
@ShobhaRaghuram:“Rename
Imperial College as Imperial
Industry and replace academic
faculty with fund raisers.”
@dawnbazely:“@david_
colquhoun @AMCELL Thank
you.This is like something out
of Terminator: the rise of the
(administrator) machines.”
“This is not,I shouldn’t have to say,
how academia works.Peter Higgs,
of Higgs Boson fame,said that
there was’no Eureka moment’to
his work,and he only has 4 papers
listed on Google Scholar: but what
papers! Science rarely has a Eureka
moment: it’s rather a series of
careful,thoughtful developments
of work done by one’s forebears
and peers.
“A management which demands a
Eureka a day is one which doesn’t
just not’get’academia,it’s a
management which contradicts
the academic method and it’s one
which has forgotten that it’s meant
to serve the needs of science,the
arts,students and researchers,not
the insatiable maw of attention
seeking'Leaders'(that's the word
they use now) and the PR ofice.
It’s also a management that kills.”
“Grimm’s Tale”,ThePlashingVole
“Grant income is usually necessary
for scientiic research,but
ultimately it is a measure of how
much we are a drain of society,not
a measure of our value to society
(or science).The problem here
is that universities are rewarded
too much for grant income,when
they should be rewarded more for
research output.
Research would be less wasteful;
society and government would
get a better deal on the research
they fund; good universities
would get a better deal in the long
run; and universities wouldn't end
up sacking good researchers who
don’t like gambling too much of
their time on the horrendously
stochastic grant application
process.”

“Why[...]create working
conditions so severe that it creates
widespread anxiety among
professors,causing some to
contemplate suicide? How well
are we teaching students if the
professors are either on welfare or
simply good hustlers that know
how to bring home the bacon?”

Grimm tales too?”,Bill White on

“Is it about one bad manager,at
one particularly bad university? Is
it about the culture of one place,
all by itself,some unique sinkhole
of shame into which one life has
fallen? Can that one university
review its procedures and its
management training,and
encourage the rest of us to move
on to the next bit of news?”

be reformed?”
