THE PIT
From the black abyss of the pit come vague
rumblings. Are these the death throes of the
slumbering giant or the firey birth of some golden
phoenix? Only God and EE Doc' Smith can tell, for
the SF Club's hierarchy have finally obtained some
films (fanfare of angelic voices rises to a crescendo
and then fades away) On 4 December we have the
long awaited Protect X set in 2118 AD it has the
badies sending *ur hero back to the 1960s to
rediscover the Secret. I'm not giving away any more
than that but it's real SF with a better story line than
most of Hollywood's morass of glamour SciFi
(except Alien) On 1
1 December we have the
thinking man's Betty Boop in the lithe form of Ms
Jane Fonda. Barbarella is perverted (leather and
plastic fetishes etc etc), sick, tasteless and very, very
funny - for anyone with an open - if twisted - mind-
Together with Ms JF are John Philip Law (who?)
and Marcel Marceau (we think he's the one hanging
on wires from the ceiling) so come early-for a seat.
Both are brought by SF Club Promotions
Corporation (Amalg) and will be shown at 7:00pm in
Huxley 213. Entrance is free to members
(membership 50p) and only 20p to
plebians/perverts.
SCAB NIGHT
For the first time, this year's Scab Night
took the form of a revue. It opened with a
Buster Keaton film. The General, a good film,
but I think enjoyed as much for its incongruity
as anything else. SP3 played us a session of
jazz rock and the drummer is to be
commended. The band's performance was
impressive. Shakespeare must be oscillating
in his grave after Derrick Everett's
interpretation of all his plyas in forty minutes.
As a member of the cast, I felt the atmosphere
was hilarious, Dramsoc was acting well and
judging by the giggles rising from the
darkened halt even the audience enjoyed it!
Another band rose from the roadies'
confusion; Paradox, who played well but
would have been much improved by more
power, a cleaner sound, and a tidying up of
ragged edges.
Ken Russell's The Boyfriend ended Scab
Night. In my opinion we saw a revue that far
outclassed last year's motley affair. Roll on
next year, and thanks to all who took part,
both artistes and audience.

EDUCATION CUTS COMMITTEE
There has been an acute lack of action and
protest against the effect of cuts on all
aspects of education and as such, the
Governments Education Bill will go through
early next year, without consultation with
those effected or any real protest against it.
Cuts will then start to bite and many people
will want to do something as standards and
opportunities decline. N U S has been
ineffective, but action resulting from a c o -
ordinated campaign in the universities of the
southwest has resulted in contacts with
lecturers, college staff and the NUT. This is
encouraging and must take place at IC. We
must oppose all cuts at IC that will result in a
decrease of academic standards and
opportunities, and try and convince College
staff of the foolishness of cuts on principle.
We must make contact with other colleges,
organisations and individuals with a view to
forming a broad based campaign (which is
not pie in the sky, many people feel very
strongly on this and this strength of feeling
will increase) to inform people and act to get
the cuts changed. Turn up at the meeting
today at 12:45 in Mech Eng 664 and give your
views. We will also be planning publicity
events, the first one being the leafletting of
the underground during the rush hour on
Friday 7 December. IC coffin bearers and
leafletters will be needed!

"By theway, howdid
theinterviewgo?"
"Very well. They seemed as interested
in what I wanted to do as what they wanted me
to do, if you know what I mean. The whole thing
was very frank. Not at all what I expected'.'
"They'redifferent from
theothers,then?"
"I think so. Their approach to business
—and the strong working relationship they
have with their clients—are certainly refresh-
ing. Their groups are small and carefully con
structed, which makes the whole thing more
friendly and,of course,makes the transition
into their scale of work that much easier —
giving them a better chance to help me along'.'
"Alongtowhat?"
"Well, there are plenty of chances for
overseas travel—and they're a good firm for
specialisation. At the interview we talked
about Management Consultancy—an area
which I could well be interested in for the
future—and as it turns out a specialist area
with a lot of potential'.'
"I alwaysthought you were
interested in the
Big Wheels of Industry."
"I still am—and working with a firm of
this size, that's just where I'm going to find
myself over the next few years. Whether I
choose to specialise, stay in the profession or
travel,I'm still keeping that option open—my
training and experience will be invaluable"
