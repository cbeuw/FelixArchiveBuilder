Whilst the rest of Environmental Week i s concerned with stimulating thoughts and discussion
on various key environmental issues, t h i s weekend has the action, and i s a chance to get
a c t i v e l y and p o s i t i v e l y involved i n helping others with t h e i r environment. Adventure
playgrounds give kids from heavily b u i l t up areas a place of t h e i r own to play, meet t h e i r
friends and develop i n . As such they provide a necessary focus f o r these children. We
looked at many of the adventure playgrounds i n London, the good and the bad. We chose Holly
Street because i t i s completely closed at the moment. A l o t of work needs to be done, new
structures need to be b u i l t , a piece of waste land has to be dug over to make a garden,
murals need painting. The kids themselves w i l l help too but taeres too much f o r them to do
on t h e i r own. Lets get Holly Street open f o r the c h i l d r e n of Hackney again. We're a l l
meeting under the Beit Archway at 10.30am on Saturday and Sunday morning or at Holly Street,
Hackney, E8 at 11.30am. Dress up warmly and bring a friend i t ' l l be l o t s of fun.
