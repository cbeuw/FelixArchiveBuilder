Cheap energy and consumer society gave r i s e to suburban sprawl and the decay of inner
c i t i e s during the 50's i n the U.S.A. U n t i l recently i t was thought that U.K. c i t i e s
were following the same pattern. This i s now being questioned as i s the influence of
transport urban patterns. In the midst of t h i s are ideas of o f f i c e d e c e n t r a l i s a t i o n ,
new town growth and inner c i t y decay.

should expand these problems and hopefully illuminate various proposed solutions.
