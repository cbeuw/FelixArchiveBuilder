Dear Colin
The External Affairs Committee
held on Monday 26 November
decided the following:
E A C Notes
1. That the advertising of the past
two U G M s has been sadly lacking
and inadequate.
2. O n Monday 26 November, the
failure of the Exec News to
appear.
3. That these duties come under
the brief of the H o n Sec and/or
Publicity Officer.
4. That Union policy states that
U G M s must be given ten College
days (fourteen oridinary days)
notice.
5. That the quoracy of the U G M on
6 November was successfully
challenged.
6. That the absence of Exec News
restricted the activities of E A C (26
November).
E A C Believes
1. That the lack of publicity
divorces the Union from its
membership.
2. That the absence of Exec News
i n h i b i t s t h e e f f i c i e n c y a n d
democratic running and debating
of Union Affairs.
E A C dislikes the attitude of the
Hon Sec in these matters.
E A C Instructs
1. The Hon Sec to pull his socks
up.
2. The Hon Sec to ensure that
s u c h p u b l i c i t y is p r o d u c e d
according to Union policy.
This motion was passed nem con
at E A C on 26 November and has
been forwarded to FELIX for
publication.

Dear Sir
Recently various members of
College have taken thoughtless
pleasure in throwing various
items of rubbish on Morphy Day,
Exec Torture and 'Rag Hit Squad'
outings, at S T O I C members while
they are operating the portable
video recording equipment. We
would like to point out that if the
e q u i p m e n t w e r e b r o k e n ,
r e p l a c e m e n t w o u l d c o s t
approximately Â£1,500. We would
thus appreciate people showing
respect for the equipment.
Yours faithfully
Bryan Steel

Sir
Yet again the R C S Boredom
Committee is on the rampage in
FELIX correspondence.
Frank James' latest strange
hypothesis would seem to be that
C C U s cause people to behave
strangely, hence people seek
refuge from strange behaviour by
socialising with C C U types,
whereupon they are immediately
leapt on (by homosexuals?) and
degraded so that they feel
inclined to leave College.
On several occasions, I have felt
inclined to leave IC forever. This
seems to be a common feeling in
Mech Eng 2 - perhaps going some
way to explaining the high 2nd
year failure rates. As a primaeval
being - that is a mere mortal - my
basic needs are:
i. Food (preferably good food)
ii. Accomodation (preferably
comfortable, affordable and with
a reasonable degree of privacy, ie
not sharing a triple room).
iii. A soft, warm female.
If a freshman arrives at College
and decides that Mooneys are
awful, he doesn't like sharing a
room in a seedy hotel with a total
stranger and that he'd better tie a
knot in it, we don't stand much
chance of keeping the poor guy.
I don't see ICU busting a gut to
solve any of these primary
problems of IC student life. Frank
James himself even managed to
help lose University Challenge (if
this guy is so smart etc.)
Now for an illogical change of
topic. W h y s h o u l d n ' t Steve
Hutching's letter to Colin Palmer
be published? We have been
inundated with news about John
Shuttleworth suing ICU, so we
should be forewarned about the
next incredible waste of time,
money and energy to come our
way.
Sure it's the principle that
matters. The principle here is
whether it is worth standing on the
letter of law for every mistake that
anybody makes. If you drove
t h r o u g h L o n d o n w i t h o u t
exceeding any speed limits, you
would be a rolling road block.
Just why does Hutchings need
his back scratched by Watmough
anyway? Surely the quality or
otherwise of his photographs
should speak for themselves. I
seem to remember them as fairly
unspectacular. As for Hutchings
letter, I'd like to make him look
silly, but I think he's done well
enough for himself.
Yours faithfully

Dear Sir
I have studied the problem of
those students at IC who want
abortion on demand in great
depth and have decided that they
may need to seek counselling
advice.
Their problem isn't uncommon
amongst abortionists. It begins
with their arithmetic inaccuracy.
In many of their publications they
claim that in Portugal 2,000
women die each year from
backstreet abortions. The actual
figure for deaths from all causes
of women aged 15-44 in Portugal
in the most recent year for which
figures are available is 2,062
(source: United Nations).
T h e i r s e c o n d p r o b l e m is
extreme self-centredness leading
to a belief that women have the
right to destroy an individual to
avoid inconvenience to them-
selves.
Their final problem is a desire to
be unpleasant to individuals or
groups of individuals that they do
not personally know, particularly
Roman Catholics whom they
portray as mindless morons.
Allied to this istheirexclusion and
hatred of people presenting
differeing views. Most often this
feeling results from an inability to
understand concepts that are
derived from scientific facts.
Abortionists who seek help with
their problems might find the
following publications useful: A
Doctor's Creed by Aleck Bourne;
The report of the European
Commision of Human Rights on
the Bruggemann and Scheuten
case; The Decleration on the
Rights of the Child adopted by the
United Nations.
Yours helpfully

Dear Ed
In a strange way Disgusted of
Tunbridge Wells is right. For
myself, as the Corrie Bill is close
to my heart, I would like to see
something done. The proper way
is not through slanging matches
at U G M s , but at Christmas tea
parties, so I hereby invite Miss
Clark and crew to a discussion
over mince pies. I suggest in the
Bot Zoo C o m m o n Room one
evening, if she would contact me
to arrange a time.

Dear Sir
I realise that a great deal will
probably be said about those who
helped at Carnival, but I felt that
my own band of helpers did such
an incredible job, that I had to
thank them directly for the effort
that they put in. So, Steve

Dear Sir
Having been at Imperial College
since the beginning of October,
and having listened to the 'Frank
James on C C U s ' debate ever
since, it appears the problem is
one of maturity, or the lack of it, of
students and their respective
C C U s . I would suggest this is not
the fault of the student or the
C C U s , but the fault lies in the
system that allows direct entry to
(any) university from the 6th form.
The choice of going directly to
university from one's 6th form
(which is the majority case for
most prospective students) is, I
feel, a soft option which allows the
student to avoid the real world for
an extra three or so years.
The solution, as I see it, is to
stop direct entry and replace it
with compulsory deferment for
one, or preferably two, years.
During this time away from the
education system, the potential
student would have a greater
opportunity to broaden his/her
mind and come into contact with a
wide range of people from all
walks of life (there is life beyond
mining, engineering and science,
actually). Also, working during
this one or two year's 'off is good
experience as it destroys any
illusions that one may have about
the world outside of education
being a nice, easy place to have to
exist and consequently makes
you appreciate university more.
Before I'm shot down by anyone
who thinks I am old before my
time, boring etc, bear this in mind:
most, if not all, of my ex-
workmates (yes, I was at work for
over two years before joining
Imperial) show a maturity that few
students I have seen attain, and
yet are still able to enjoy
themselves down the pub, have
fun and lead as full a life as
possible without being B-O-R-l-
N-G. They are also of the opinion
that some (not all) of the activities
of the C C U s are "pathetic",
"moronic" etc, although they do
agree that the C C U s do some
good (I give them a balanced view,
you see).
Thus, to re-iterate what I said,
earlier, it is not the students orthe
C C U s who are to blame for their
lack of maturity, it is the systems
fault for not allowing them to
attain it.
Yours sincerely
Simon Jerome
Dear Sir
T h a n k G o d for the new
expensive tills in the refectories.
Once the cashiers have got the
hang of them, and the queues are
shortened (instead of getting
longer) diners can be out of the
place quickly enough to survive
the experience of the expensive
food.
Yours (Tunbridge Welled - No,
that wasn't me)
