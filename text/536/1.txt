THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION Friday, November 30th, 1979 Issue No. 536
UGM REPORT
The news was announced at the U G M last
Tuesday that the students at IC halls of
residence face an increase of £1.00a week on
their rent to make up for the £70,000 shortfall
incurred by the halls due to a lack of
conference bookings during the summer
vacation, the student houses and Hamlet
Gardens, which made a profit, were
exempted from this increase but they will be
hit by the decrease in the furnishing
allowance which is used on occasions to
replace old or buy new essential equipment
such as cookers, washing machines and
fridges.
The Union Haldane Library Committee has
still not reached any agreement with the
College H L C as to the three records and the
cassette that the C H L C are witholding from
the library because they feel they are
'unsuitable'. The U H L C believe they should
be responsible for any censorship of the
records that they buy and that the records in
question are acceptable.
After a successful challenge to the order of
the agenda, the motion on the Public Image
Of IC was debated and the proposed
ammendment that the reference to "beer-
swilling louts with latent homosexual
tendencies" was offensive to gays and should
be replaced was passed A majority also
passed the motion.
The Anti-Corrie Bill motion was moved
straight to a vote, and passed by a large
majority. The main debate was propounded
at the last U G M when a challenge to the
quorum was made and upheld before the vote
was taken
The motion On The Underground was also
passed with the ammendment to I C U
instructs that IC should atend the education
cuts protest march organised by t h e T U C f o r
Wednesday 28 November. The ammendment
proposed that the campaign should focus on
the overseas students fees increase rather
than the cuts in general was defeated.
Late News: Hall rents will probably not now
be increased (see above).

RAG WEEK
Personally, I was very pleased at the
overall success o f the week, the events
being generally well attended a n d
certainly m u c h enjoyed b y those who
took part. It was also quite a
considerable financial success, as
although the accounts haven't quite
been sorted out yet, we've certainly
made over £1,000 over the week, not
counting the procession.
I was especially pleased that some of.
the new events such as R a g a r a m a and
the C C U Boat Race came off well and I
hope they will continue in future years.
