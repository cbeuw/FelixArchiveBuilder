ENOUGH ROPE
One requirement for a successful squeeze
is the 'rectification of the count', which just
consists of losing some tricks until you can
make all but one of the rest. I n the hand below
the defence co-operated admirably. The

The 3NT rebid showed a balanced 19
count. The four of diamonds was led and won
by the king. The continuation of the 9 was
allowed to hold, so setting the position for a
squeeze. The potential eleventh trick should
come from 8D, J S or the ten of clubs. The
third round of diamonds was taken by the
ace, where a club and a spade had been
thrown from dummy. The A K of spades were
cashed, followed by three rounds of hearts.
The fourth heart from dummy squeezed West
in three suits! A small club was the least
embarassing discard. Both South and West
threw a diamond on the last heart. A club to
the ace was followed by a club to the Q, K and
J leaving dummy's ten master.
On a non-diamond lead arguments could
be put forward for alternative lines of play for
eleven tricks, such as taking the spade
finesse, or playing for a 3-3 club break, or
finding East with a doubleton club honour.
