Many people have sworn at me, publicly
criticised and generally complained about
the style of FELIX. At last Tuesday's U G M and
in the Liberal Newspaper comments were
made which were personal attacks on me. I
am aware that FELIX is nowhere near perfect
and I welcome constructive criticism and
advice but I wish that personality clashes
could be kept out of the FELIX discussion.
Imperial is heading towards the 1980's with
its mind focussed on the cuts that are
inevitable. At the moment their true nature is

unrealised by the majority of people.
In next weeks 30th Anniversary FELIX we
.shall not only look back overthe last years but
we shall also try to predict the results of the
present schemes to save money.
Bicycles:
Roger has asked me to correct his article of
last week where he wrote that Bikes are
insured by the Union if you live in College
residence and that the Bike is kept on College
premises. Bikes are in fact NOT insured. The
answer is to secure your Bike as best you can,
but Jeremy Nunns, had his Bike stolen
despite the fact that it was padlocked with a
strong steel chain. I am aware of the gangs
that operate in this area and I have challenged
a Spanish gentleman who was over-
interested in the Bikes outside Mech. Eng. He
e x p l a i n e d that he was interested in
purchasing a Bike for a friend in Spain. Watch
out for Bike thieves and if you notice anything
suspicious contact College Security.
Credits:
Are due to Margaret Ramsey, Jeremy
Nunns, Paul Williams, Austin Reeve and Mary
Freeman among others especially the
collating team that miraculously emerges at
my time of greatest need when my energy is
almost exhausted. Don't forget the 30th
Anniversary FELIX dinner on the 7th
December to which everyone is welcome; see
FELIX Office or posters for further details. My
thanks also to Lars Wernberg-Moller for his
work with the FELIX S O C I E T Y which is now
providing valuable contributions, advice and
feedback. The next meeting is on Monday at
12:45 in the FELIX Office and anyone
interested in FELIX is urged to attend.
Finally a big thank-you to Ian and Maz for
not only producing FELIX but for giving
advice and support during a period of trials
and tribulations, coupled with a general
cutback in my sleeping quota.
