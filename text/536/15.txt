THE DEVILS
Next Wednesday sees the opening
night of Dramsoc's latest production,
THE DEVILS by J o h n Whiting.
Set in the France of Louis XIII and
Cardinal Richelieu, it is based on
historical events, as portrayed by
Aldous Huxley in The Devils of Loudon.
The story revolves around Burbain
Grandier (played by Richard Jones of
ME1), a powerful, but lecherous
member of the high clergy.
His undoing, in more than one sense,
comes in the form of a young girl,
P h i l l i p e , d a u g h t e r of the t o w n
prosecutor.
Parallel scenes involve a sister in a
convent, who has never met Grandier.
However, she hysterically claims he has
deflowered her. She seems to represent
repressed sexuality, as the producer
Richard King, an ex IC student put it:
"Has more hang-ups than Freud ever
thought of."
The play was written in the early
sixties shortly after the McCarthy era,
and elements also of Miller's The
Crucible are found.
The attitudes of the Bourgeorisie, as
exemplified by the town's doctor and
pharmacist, to the decadence of
Grandier are also interesting.
One member of the cast who will be
familiar to many is Eric Jarvis, as
Cardinal Richelieu. It is rumoured he
needed special permission to emerge
from his home in a broom cupboard,
located somewhere in College!
The dress rehersal showed, assuming
all goes fairly smoothly, that with
familiar themes of sex and violence spun
t o g e t h e r s l i g h t l y differently, the
Dramsoc production will definately be
worth a look.

Another new event was the Beer
Festival, which was a great success, the
Superag glasses being in great demand,
and (despite the extreme cheapness of
the beer) m a k i n g a healthy profit. T h e
credit for this superb event must go to
Nick M o r t o n , who organised it all, with
a little help f r o m C h r i s Bruton, T i m and
the Real Ale Soc crowd, a n d of course
D r a m s o c for the scaffolding. I'd also
like to thank everyone who helped
serve, clear up etc, and especially Scout
and Guide Club who d i d the food.
The other big event was surely the
Procession, a n d although it left m e
behind after about fifteeen minutes, I
was quite satisfied to have seen it get off
(almost) without a hitch; a task which
seemed impossible when I stated '
working on it last July! I'm sure
everyone who went enjoyed it; even the
Police who were really great, a n d
thanks goes to the C C U s , Selkirk H a l l
and the R e d Cross for putting on floats,
not to mention K i r s t e n and A d r i a n , our
r e s i d e n t M i c h e l i n M e n . T h e
accompanying collection.was also very
successful, a n d a special mention must
be given to Jo, who not only collected
the most money, but managed to pass
on her enthusiasm to the few heroic
Guildspeople who went out again t
collect i n the evening, thus bringing the
day's total to over £1,100, enough to buy
two radio-hearing aids which we should
be able to buy a n d present sometime
next t e r m .
Well time a n d space don't permit m e
to go through every event, but thanks
must go to everyone who staged an
event, ie Scab, Aerosoc, Folk C l u b etc
and particularly the C C U Execs,
JOHN MILES CONCERT
with Roy Sundholm as support
There were about 600 people in the Great
hall when Roy Sundholm, the support act,
started his set just after 8:15 on Monday
evening. Roy describes his music as "modern
Rock'n'Roll" which is a very apt description;
each of the eight songs that he played was
up-tempo, although there was certainly a
variation in style. His album The Chinese
Method was recorded with session musicians
and the six-piece group he had on stage had
only been together for two months, but they
seemed to play together remarkably well.
Apart from Roy Sundholm on lead vocals and
guitar, there were two other guitarists, bass,
drums and keyboards. The latter, though,
were underused, being swamped by the
guitars.
Of the songs that he played, I most liked
the second number The Girls Are Out Now
which was fast Rock'n'Roll and apart from a
good tune, had more life than many of the
others. After that he launched into his new
single Did You Ever Have A Heart which was
quite a raunchy number. Of the remaining
songs, several seemed to have a distinct
heavy metal influence, but with a strong
drum/bass beat, and a couple reminded me a
little of Foreigner.
When John Miles came on stage at 9:30
(by which time the audience had swelled to
about 700), he gave a m u c h m o r e
professional impression right from the start;
likewise it was obvious w h o the crowd had
waited for. The very start of his act was
obviously planned and reminded me of the
way the Floyd used to start their concerts.
In the second number High Fly, his first
single, the lighting and special effects were
first used with crossed spotlights from below
on John Miles and smoke around his legs.
The song itself. I felt was rather more rocky
than the original, with harder vocals He went
straight from that into the title track of his first
album, Rebel which he sung with feeling,
backed by effective bass and keyboards.
After Bad Blood from his latest album
More Miles Per Hour he played Pull tne Damn
Thing Down, which despite its age. was given
a very modern treatment: the most notable
thing about it was the drum orientated
instrumental at the end, with superb strobe
lighting under the drum kit.
J o h n Miles then introduced the band:
apart from himself on vocals and lead guitar,
there was B o b Marshall on bass and other
guitars, Barry Black on drums and Brian
Chapman playing three separate keyboards.
His new single Don't Give Me Your
Sympathy was next. Very uptempo but
typically John Miles
especially V P s , for the m a n y events
they were involved in.
I'm greatly indebted to everyone who
helped in any way, and special thanks to
Chaps Club for their highly successful

superb posters at a moments notice;
K i r s t e n a n d J a n for interminably
sitting on doors a n d generally being
