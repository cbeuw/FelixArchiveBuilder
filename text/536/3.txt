NOT A UGM REPORT
This report of the Union General
meeting held last Tuesday is entitled Not

A wash down every eight years, with a
new coat in between, is all residents in
the Halls can expect in the future!
Further mbre there will be no more
sewing machines and student houses
will have problems buying fridges.'
In case you are still confused, just
remember: the Halls made a loss in the
summer when students were not here
(but M o o n e y b r e a k f a s t s w e r e
compulsory for conferences), whereas
Hamlet Gardens and the Houses made a
profit (with no Mooney breakfast), so
clearly the Hall residents (who have just
moved in) have to pay more particularly,
since they are mostly first years, they are
not aware of the 22% increase they have
already had this year. Perhaps we

£1.00 each, or £70,000 (whichever is
greater!).
HALDANE L
The meeting heard of the censorship
being operated in Haldane L
against records being bought by
st ts. Most people agreed that
this policy was a load of excrement.
DEMOCRACY AND DISRUPTION
After the Executive- reports and the
election for U L U S C R (who?), the
motion everyone had been waiting for
was moved first on the agenda. The
motion c o n c e r n e d the E x e c u t i v e
responsibility for IC's failure on
University Challenge (or was it the
mascot's fault?)'. Two attempts were
made to subvert the c o u r s e of
democracy and get the meeting to revert
to s e r i o u s b u s i n e s s , both w e r e
decisively quashed.
Before the motion was passed, the
anti-gay remarks were at least deleted,
though I did expect someone from the
Left to delete the one sexist remark
concerning the need for more women at
IC to help the team score. They could
perhaps have inserted: "To encourage
socialogy students in order to get more
Marx" but that would perhaps given too
much of a different Engel on the subject.
AGAINST THE CORRIE BILL
At last the motion against the Corrie
anti-abortion bill was passed. Although
we still don't know whether Merche
Clark was ever unborn, we did learn
(from a gentleman who was definately
born) that women can't be trusted to
control their own bodies because they

The first ladies match of the season took
place at Harlington last Sunday morning. For
anyone expecting to see a farce, there was a
great disappointment, for this match was
played at a surprisingly high standard and
both teams put on a more than competant
exhibtion of rugby football.
Under the lawful eye of referee, "I didn't
mean it" Gunner, U C kicked off. Immediately,
IC made use of their superior backs and
launched a counter attack, which eventaully
broke down on the U C 25yd line. Although it
was clear that the U C pack were stronger
than ours, we were able to obtain good
possession through some excellent tackling
by the whole team and some inspired rucking
by our pack. This hard work eventually led to
a try, when Thunder Thighs made, a blind
break and beat two tackles for a fine try. t h e
conversion attempt by Cornetto was unlucky
to just scrape the outside of the post.
After the restart U C began to win their
share of possession, but they were stunned
at the tackling ability of the whole IC team;
Hotlips Hood, Animal and Happy Hooker, to
name just a few. Due to this superb tackling,
IC were able to set up some good attacking
moves thorugh the fly half. Dodger. This led
to some fine runs from wingers, Dosser and
Cornetto. Smurf and Streaker also showed
their class in the centre with Streaker |
showing her legs on more than one occasion. «
She was unlucky to fall two yards short of the .§
line after one particular run that even Horror o
Smart would have been proud of. So the first £
half ended with IC unlucky to have only four |
points on the board. S
During the second half, U C put our tryline
under a lot of pressure, but our defence stood
firm until, after a line out, the ball bounced
right to their number eight to dive over for a
try. From the restart U C again, put our
defence to the test and it was not until twenty
minutes that U C managed to score again,
through a fine individual run by their winger.
Many teams would have given up at this point,
but not IC Ladies: Under the driving
leadership of Smelly Shirley, they put in a
tremendous fight back and throush some
inspired kicking by Hotlips and some
determined forward play, IC were on the
brink of scoring when the final whistle blew
So the match ended in defeat for IC Ladies,
but the performance of the whole team, in
every respect, was something to be proud of

CUTS OUT, DEMOS IN, HUMAN
RIGHTS ADJOURNED
The final motion passed was on
education cuts when a representative of
the Conservative party failed to limit the
motion just to the issue of overseas
students fees. By now ICU will already

IC STUDENTS ATTEND EDUCATION
CUTS PROTEST MARCH
A contingent of IC students including
Deputy President of ICU, Malcolm Brain took
part in the education cuts protest march on
Wednesday.
The massive gathering of trade unions,
c o l l e g e s a n d u n i v e r s i t i e s ( i n c l u d i n g
Lancaster, Bath, Susses and Essex), schools
and left-wing political parties began to move
off from Hyde Park nearly on schedule
although, due to the large numbers present,
the IC contingent did not leave until after
4:00pm.
The first union groups arrived at the
House of Parliament at about twenty past
three and from that time anyone walking back
along the route of the march encountered an
almost continuous procession of people,
banners and placards. They would also have
been leafletted, pressured to buy various left-
wing newspapers and have heard the
intermittent chants. The march was
followed by a lobbying of MPs.
