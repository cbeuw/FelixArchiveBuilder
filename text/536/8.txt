Industrial
Society
mm)
The Industrial Society is the College's
newest and fastest growing student
club. Despite being formed only last
October, we already have 70 members
and a wide diversity of activities. So far
this term, these have included a visit to
the Airfix factory at Wandesworth, a
behind the curtain tour of a major
branch of Lloyd's bank and a
presentation by Mars on the
manufacturing of its products. In all
our events we try to get at the hard
facts behind the organisation: from the
technical, the industrial relations, the
financial and the careers viewpoints. In
the case of visits, this means not just a
tour of the works but also a critical
discussion with the staff and
managers. We try to cater for a wide
range of interests and needs and next
term will see such activities as a
presentation by Courtaulds and in
early February a visit to the Ford
production line at Dagenham. The
most immediate of our future events is
a talk by Unilever on the role of the
accountant in industry, which will take
place next Wednesday 13 December in
the Bot/Zoo common room. This will
be an illustrated talk and refreshments
will be provided. If you can make it this
Wednesday and you have not yet
joined, look-out for notices of future
events or drop me a line and I shall
send you more details of our activities
as they are arranged.

SOVA
What is it like trying to learn to live a
normal life again attei a spell In prison?
Or il you're in prison, alone and
adjusting to a new environment?
It's hot easy, but SOVA tries to help
offenders, ex-offenders and thse on
probation by organising: prison
visiting, working in a bail unit, literacy
help, in and out of prison, adventure
weekends for the 'young at risk' and
help for crime victims.
If you've had no experience in
probation or social work, the Society
for Voluntary Associates run groups
and lectures to inform you of the
contemporary problems and ways of
overcoming them.
Probation work is not a popular field to
work in, it's difficult and demanding,
but it can be very rewarding by
involving you directly with people in
need of help.
If you think you may beinterested in
joining the Voluntary Associates and
contributing a few hours, once in a
while, to do something constructive
and useful, please contact me for
further details, or any ICCAG member
(distinguished by the ICCAG badge)
or come to the next ICCAG meeting on
Monday 3 December at 12:30pm in the
Union, 3rd floor.
