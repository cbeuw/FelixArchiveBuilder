CITY & GUILDS
Phew! T h a n k G o d Rag Week is over!
T e n really hectic days of non-stop
action in and around College.
Tuesday was the Disgusting Games
in the Quad. I think we chose some
really disgusting games; some people
never want to see another baked bean
again! The Beer Festival on Wednesday
was great fun with many excellent pints
of ale being drunk. T h u r s d a y was Exec
Torture with a mixture prepared by M r
P J Leggett which exceeded the bounds
of c o m m o n decency. However, he
received a fair proportion of this muck
over himself. Over £100 was collected
for Rag. Carnival was on Friday with
over 1,000 people attending. The bands
went down well, especially U r c h i n and
the Steel Band and everybody enjoyed
themselves.
Anybody who has seen a Guilds shield
around, the fancy one which went
missing at Carnival, please tell us or
give it back. It is not a mascot, it is
an inviolate (that is not violate)
decoration.
As you m a y know, our Honorary
Secretary, M a r k Hope has resigned, due
to academic pressure. T h i s means we
have to elect a new H o n Sec. Papers will
come down at 5:30pm today (Friday). If
you still want to stand see us in the
Union Office, then get your name on the
paper with ten seconders. T h i s is an
important post with m a n y respon-
sibilities. A job description has been
circulated, so read this and come and
find out more in the Office. The
elections will take place at the Union
meeting on II December.

GAY?
The hypocrisy of our society is manifested
most strongly by people who not only cannot
be honest with others but cannot be honest
even with themselves about their gay
tendencies and consequently feel a need to
prove that they are straight either by being
violently opposed to or by ridiculing gay
people, or alternatively by adopting a
dominant male chauvanist attitude towards
women.
One object of IC G A Y S O C is to encourage
the freedom, truth and openness which the
conditioning and conventions of society
frequently suppress by forcing men and
women into the stereotype roles set down by
itself. How sad it is that society kills and
buries our true thoughts and feelings while
people who refuse to bury the truth and
refuse to accept the stereotype of convention
are rejected by society and made to feel guilty
or insane.
Fortunately some gays have the courage to
face a hostile society and this has led to gay
demonstrations like the one recently in New
York of over 100,000 gay women and gay men
demonstrating against legal discrimination
against gays.
That prejudice and discrimination against
gays stills exists is well illustrated by the
recent case of Dan White who literally got
away with murder.
How could Dan White, who murdered the
San Francisco Mayor, George Moscome and
his supervisor Harvey Milk, who fired nine
bullets into his victims and shot each one
twice in the back of the head, who had clearly
premeditated the murders as he had
smuggled the shotgun into the building and
shot the two men in different rooms, how
could he not be found guilty of murder? Well,
Harvey Milk was gay and the Mayor, George
M o s c o n e , t h o u g h not gay, s t r o n g l y
supported the rights of gays and though of
course not explicitly stated, the undertones
of prejudice and bigotry have clearly led to
this blatant travesty of justice.

ULU G A Y S O C have m e e t i n g s every
Thursday at 8:00pm in room 2D of the
University of London Union, Malet Street

NOWHERE TO GO FOR CHRISTMAS?
Many people have nowhere to go for the rest of the
year either - as anyone who has been on the soup
run will tell you. Crisis at C h r i s t m a s runs a shelter
from 23 to 28 December in London and needs
volunteers to help throughout that period. You can
come for just one day, or for the whole week. Help is
also needed before and after to prepare the centre
and to clear up. For more information, contact Fiona
Sinclair (Maths 2 letter racks).
FOOD AND CLOTHES
Are you looking forward to lots of good food and
clothes for Christmas? How about sparing a
thought for the homeless and hungry of London.
These people do not have much of a life, so try to
give them a happy Christmas - it doesn't take much.
Please bring donations of food (stuff that will keep
until Christmas!) and warm clothes, to the ICCAG
room at lunchtime (top of the Union building -
follow the signs) or to Selkirk 666 Donations are
also welcome, please make cheques payable to
Crisis at Christmas. For more information please
contact Fiona Sinclair (Maths 2 letter racks)
