Turner • & Newall (assets: over
£100,000,000, employees: some
40,000) are frequently described as the
'asbestos giants' but, though asbestos
remains a basic interest, their com-
panies are also concerned in plastics,
insulation, chemicals, mineral wool and
glass fibre. The Turner <£ Newall Man-
agement Appointments Adviser will be
visiting Imperial College on Friday 14th
February 1964. If you would like an
interview, please contact the secretary
of the Appointments Board.
Every year about 8 outstanding graduates
are given the opportunity of joining Turner &
Newall, one of the strongest, most impor-
tant though least publicised* groups in
British industry.
They enter under a broad and thoughtful
training scheme- which, recognising the
scope of industry in general and T&N in
particular, give's.them time to discover the
direction in which they can best employ and
extend their talents. Every encouragement,
including financial help, is given for them to
acquire the further qualifications they may
need. This flexible training invariably means
that the graduate assumes managerial res-
ponsibility more confidently—and certainly
earlier—than is often the case in industry
today. The company also recruits scientists
and - engineers direct ' into its research
branches.

Thirty-Five Years
It is thirty-five years since the
talkies came to Britain. This
auspicious occasion will be cele-
brated on the last day of January
by the screen of the first British
talking picture—Alfred Hitch-
cock's " Blackmail." On the
very same day you can see Berg-
man's superb medieval tale, "The
Virgin Spring." This film has
been described as " cruel but
beautiful." Without the psycho-
logical depth and complex ideas
of Bergman's earlier films, " The
Virgin Spring " has the simplicity
of thought and style of a mystery
play. Like medieval life, it is
violent and simple.
T H E Y A R E COMING . . .
A chartered surveyor, the
matron of a London hospital,
some friars, some monks, a priest
cum Monte Carlo Rally driver,
a couple of artists, a journalist,
the general works manager of a
large industrial company, the
headmaster of a London school,
and some very ordinary clergy-
men. These will soon be de-
scending upon us, led by a bald-
headed Scotish monk, Fr. John
Shand!
Fr. Shand will be directing the
missioners conducting he Teach-
ing Week to Imperial College
(February 2nd—9th). Three talks
he will be giving on " THE
CHRISTIAN F A I T H " will be
the foundations of the Week, and
these will be held in the Senior
Common Room, Southside, from
8—9 p.m., on Monday, February
3rd, Tuesday, February 4th, and
Wednesday, February 5th.
Another major series-pf events
will be the numerous Coffee
Parties taking place in rooms
round and about the college
Halls. If you want ot meet any
of the team, I feel pretty sure
that there will be a coffee party
on a floor accessible to you, and
you will be welcome at any oi
these.
