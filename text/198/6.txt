PREVENTION IS BETTER
T H A N C U R E
" If you don't want your wallet
stolen, don't leave it lying around
in coats or jackets." Time and
again Jock Henry, the Chief
Security Officer has been round
the buildings of the College in
person with this rather obvious
warning to people working in
labs, and offices. A man of less
Stirling character might have been
seduced by the opportunities for
larceny to be found; and yet de-
spite him people go Im losing
money in just this way and won-
der why they get short shrift from
Security. At the beginning of this
term, three cases were pending,
two thefts of wallets and one of a
handbag, left in a toilet.
But in addition, there was a
coat and a typewriter stolen way
back last term, and a Jazz Club
trumpet worth thirty-two pounds.
This sort of thing goes to the
police and Security hears no more
of it. The coat's owner got back
one bunch of keys lost on the
Tube, and heard nothing from
the police at all.
Thefts from Beit are right
down, but this is due to preven-
tion (by locking of doors), not
cure; chances of recovery of any-
thing but empty wallets are about
nil, and the only safeguard is as
always: carry it with you, or lock
it up. Even in the lab. ideals of the
disinterested search for truth get
buried under baser motives.
A STUDENT'S GUIDE TO
I N S U R A N C E
Why is Insurance necessary for
i student? In an institution like
Imperial College where theft and
" mysterious losses " occur fre-
quently a student can protect
himself against financial loss by
insuring his possessions. What can
be insured? Everything. Motor
Cars, Scooters, Typewriters,
Radios, bicycles, cameras, gramo-
phones, tape recorders, watches,
sportsgear, clothes, life and limb,
you name it and someone will
insure it.
How does a student obtain in-
surance?
He can go directly to one of the
large insurance companies, or deal
through an insurance broker. A
student is likely to get a better
deal from a broker who deals with
all the large insurance companies
and is in a better position to
obtain a policy to suit a student's
special needs and pocket.
How much does it cost? Firstly
it is no more expensive to insure
through a broker because he takes
his commission from the insur-
ance company. Also brokers often
offer reduced rates to students,
frequently as much as five or ten
per cent. The insurance of per-
purely nominal. £1 — 30s. per
sonal items (sportsgear etc.) is
annum.
THE MARGATE
CONFERENCE
After the N.U.S. council meet-
ing at Margate last November the
N.U.S. secretary of U.C., Mike
Freedman was interviewed to get
a more personal view of this body
which represents some 218,000
students in this country.
Mike—what has N.U.S. ta say
about the withdrawal of grants
from Iraqi students in this
country"?
—our motion urged immediate
reinstatement of grants to these
students and called for constituent
union financial and moral support.
And on Apartheid ?
—we had a very practical reso-
lution calling for more scholar-
ships for South Africans in this
country who had been discrimi-
nated against in South Africa. We
called for closest co-operation
with SACHED.
Did Council Discuss Robbins ?
—47 emergency motions were
tabled on the Robbins Report and
we had a half day discussion fol-
lowed by an 84 paragraph state-
ment. We hope to debate the
Report in April at Swansea.
N.U.S. was, in fact, asked by the
Robbins Committee to submit
evidence, which it did.
What about Student Grants ?
—N.U.S. has been campaigning
for the abolition of the means
test in student grants. Also, con-
sidering students as full-time we
have called for grants also for
vacation time.
And National Insurance?
Council calls for students to be
credited with National Insurance
Contributions whilst undergoing
full-time education.
Would You Wish to See NUS
more concerned in General
Politics ?
—most certainly not, N.U.S. is
a-pOliti?al and being anything
but would defeat its own purpose.
What Results does NUS get aftei
All this Discussion ?
—well, for instance, 4 students
imprisoned last February in Por-
tugal have been released following
N.U-S. and other Union protests.
Leeds and Manchester have set
up Dental Departments since our
report on dental services.
In wider fields our contribu-
tions to Robbins and other re-
ports, and action through our
members in Parliament have
achieved a great deal.
Our trading and travel services,
cultural and international activi-
ties are innumerable.
Finally, What do You Think oi
Colleges that Keep Out?
—When we campaign in Britain
and get results, these blackleg
colleges reap the benefits but do
nothing to help. They hinder
N.U.S. as they make N.U.S. not
fully representative.
