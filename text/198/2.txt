HIGH TREASON LEADS
TO LOW TRICKS
In March this year, the cultural
department in the Iraqi Embassy
in London sent a circular to all
Iraqi Government scholars in this
country relating to the events of
the 8th February, 1963, in Iraq.
The circular included some direct
and indirect threats ordering stu-
dents to withdraw from the
" Iraqi Students Society in the
U.K." and accused the Society of
" high treason." A month later,
two Iraqui students lost their
scholarships and in September
the number rose to 8 and now it
stands at 9. Seven of these stu-
dens are studying in London and
two in Cardiff. A l l these stu-
dents are members of the I.S.S.
With time, the financial posi-
tion of the expelled students de-
teriorated and their studies were
largely disturbed. This was par-
ticularly so with Mr. F. Jalal
(married with two children) of
L.S.E. It was almost the same
for me, were it not for the fact
that I received help from the
I.S.S. and the College.
Financial Support
The scholarships must be rein-
stated. Meanwhile British stu-
dents are asked to give whatever
possible moral and financial sup-
port they can.
Iraqi Government officials in
Baghdad and London gave no
reason for the expulsion, but the
participation of the students in
" political agitation."
All that in fact happened was
that after the coup d'etat on the
8th February, out of their worry
about their families and friends
at home, five hundred students
publicly condemned all reported
atrocities. The result was the ex-
pulsion of the members of the
I.S.S,
The students concerned raised
their problem with a number of
officials in embassv but they were
faced with insults—in certain
cases—and with complete indiff-
erence in others, Meanwhile the
expelled students started to face
the gravest of problems for they
bad no other means of living and
continuing their studies but their
grants. The I.S.S. on its part also
raised the question with the em-
bassy and the colleges concerned
and started a campaign to give
moral and financial to these
students.
Monstrous Situation
Surely it is a monstrous situa-
tion to be faced and I trust our
friends appreciate this. I suggest
that any form of protest, espec-
ially from the students' unions of
the colleges is an active way of
averting bad decisions on the part
of the Iraqi embassy and govern-
ment.
I suggest that any financial and
moral support the British stu-
dents can give to the expelled
students is very much needed. A
fund was started by the I.S.S. to
give financial support to the
Iraqi students. Through this,
British, colleagues can demon-
strate their appreciation of the
gravity of the situation.
The I.C. administration helped
in my case but there are others
and it is a question of maintain-
ing nine students academically
and materially.
The case surely is dependent
on time but as time goes the case
is becoming very difficult and
graver still.

Inspired by their successes in
the U.L.U. Jazz Competition in
December, the Jazz Club started
a fortnightly series cf South Side
Stomps last Wednestday. More
than 250 people feeling the need
for a spring fling made the scene,
served hot by the Kensington
City Stampers and cool by the
Clive Heath Quartet.
The next Stomp will be on
Wednesday Jan. 29th, and Twitch
addicts will be pleased to know
that " The Shadies" will be ap-
pearing, together with the
Stampers. The third Stomp will
offer a unique opportunity to hear
the I.C. Big Band. This will be
the first time that the band has
played at the College, so don't
miss it. Variety will be the key-
note of the South Side Stomps, so
come along, and whether you
shake, twist, jive or just listen,
you will definitely banish those
mid-week blues.

The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU — and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
