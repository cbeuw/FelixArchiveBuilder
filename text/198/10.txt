Two things stood out very clearly after the speech given by
Professor Buchanan at Imperial College last Thursday. The motor
car is going to have a great future in this country, and that, this
being so, we shall be in the devil of a mess in a comparatively short
time!
Professor Buchanan, who has had no less than six articles about
him or his work in two of last Sunday's papers, said that we will
either have to fix the amount of traffic in an area, or the place will
become a " Motor Slum''—like Exhibition Road or Prince Consort
Road. We need a thriving Motor Car industry for our economy,
and since we will have about 40,000,000 cars on the road before the
end of the century, we seem to be between the devil and the deep blue
" steel" sea.
Mr. Marples, that most overworked of Ministers, on perceiving
the problem and receiving a mass of conflicting advice (build roads,
ban cars, double public transport, ban people) almost came to the
conclusion that towns and cities were completely finished, so we had
best start all over again. Eventually he asked one man, Professor
Buchanan, to produce a report. On a tight budget, Professor
Buchanan chose his team almost entirely from outside the civil ser-
vice, and produced a long-awaited report.
The first chapter was to clear a n d d e a t h _ T o counteract t h i s

or The Godless Ones
The term Scientific Humanism,
like Christianity, covers a multi-
tude of sins, it is really a blanket
term for an agnostic, rationalist
concern for norality, and human
welfare, which acknowledges the
contribution that scientific outlook
and method can make in these
fields. And that's very probably
close to your outlook.
Last term guest speakers of the
Huxley Society discussed Morality
without God, the ethics of Adver-
tising (and trading stamps and
planned obsolescence) Religious
Belief and the Scientific Outlook,
and jointly with I.C.C.N.D. the
Ethics of Unilaterism.
This term's first guest will prob-
ably be a speaker ftom the Abor-
tion Law Reform Association,
and the wider subject of eutha-
nasia will probably attract discus-
sion. Perhaps these concepts
make you shudder; there's strong
division within Humanism and
it needs debate by those of
all opinions to clarify it. So if
you don't go to church and can
pass a whole day without feeling
the nearness of God don't repent,
come to the first meeting! The
uncommitted will have a chance
to tell a Humanist Research
Group what impression Human-
ism makes on them, and the more
thinkers we get, the more original
thought will emerge.
BUCHANAN

away misconceptions and reveal
the problem as it really stands;
there appeared to be no satis-
factory alternative to the motor-
car. The problem could be divi-
ded into two general catagories;
Firstly accessibility, the free and
quick circulation of traffic and the
possibility of stopping when you
reach your destination. Secondly
—the impact on the environment
of the motor-car, which includes
anxiety, noise, fumes, vibration,
danger, most towns will have ring
roads and pedestrian centres.
The London area remains a prob-
lem and Piccadilly Circus just
a big, round, black question mark.
Before I finish I will leave my
readers with this thought. If, in
the next ten years, the traffic
doubles, as predicted, and re-
sources do not, as predicted, and
very little is done as predicted,
what will we have left?—The
Buchanan Report.
TORIES
REPLY -
TO YOUR COST
A letter of considerable length
has been received from the Min-
istry of Pensions; this is in reply to
one sent after last terms Union
meeting expressing dissatisfaction
with the lot Of the student. The
letter lies in state in the Union,
office, and Felix has a foto-copy
should anyone wish to read it.
An excerpt follows: —
Any suggestion that those able
to continue their studies should
have their future benefits subsi-
dised at the expense of their
fellow contributors — most of
whom will have been paying con-
tributions since leaving school—
raises most difficult questions of
equity. Moreover, students who
have had the advantage of further
education can generally be ex-
pected to secure employment on
terms which will eventually pro-
vide a substantial occupational
pension.
The letter continues explaining
some of the ways in which, what it
calls " free credits," may be ob-
tained. Anyone wishing to follow
this up should certainly read it in
toto.
THE ASSOCIATION OF
SCIENTIFIC WORKERS
The Imperial College Student's
Branch of this Association has
been reconstituted with an active
and growing membership. We
aim to take action on particular
problems which the I.C. Union
has been unable or unwilling to
tackle, and also to provide mem-
bership of a wider organisation
of scientist and technologists.
Anyone wishing to join should
contact Mark Creasy or me;
further information about our
activities can be found on the
noticeboards.

AGAINST APARTHEID
The University of London
Society Against Racial Descrimi-
nation in its last meeting of repre-
sentatives from all major colleges
has decided on a term of intense
activity. This will involve all
students in the struggle against
apartheid by information sheets,
films and a national demonstra-
tion—A committee of persons
working in this College's Political,
Religious and National Societies
is being set up to promote such
activities in this Union. Anyone
interested please contact the
Chairman of the Liberal Socialist
or Communist Societies.
SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR
