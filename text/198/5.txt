dear sir...
Dear Sir,
I wish to protest about the re-
peated plonking of large stands
carrying photo's of various Scien-
tists, Guildsmen and Miners in
front of the notice boards in the
Union building. What is the point
of putting up posters advertising
your society's forthcoming events
if they (the posters) are 'to be
immediately obscurred by the
grinning features of an I.C.
"man" and his bird(s) at some
long-forgotten function? They
may like it, but we (the Union
of amalgamated poster painters)
do not.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir,
A sixpen'worth of chips I
bought in East Hartlepool during
the vac. ivas wrapped in a copy
of Felix.
Is this part of your editorial
policy!
Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir,
There is no doubt that this is a
lively and provocative newspaper.
I feel that the new face of Felix
has done much to stimulate a
wider interest in Union affairs,
and I would certainly be among
the first to applaud any contribu-
tion, however slight, to combat
the apathetic attitude of the aver-
age student towards the Union.
Four-fifths" of
top civil servants
take THE TIMES
/
v
So only this: these particular Top People must keep them-
selves fully and widely informed. They must be aware
not only of happenings in their particular field, but of dis-
cussion and comment on questions of the day, international
news, politics and the arts. For all this, they turn to T h e T i m e s .
You may not want to be a top civil servant: lots of people
don't. But the same is true of top dons, top businessmen, top
politicians. Whatever kind of top person you hope to be, it's
not too early to get in training now by taking THE TIMES
regularly. Especially since, as a student, you're entitled to it
at half price: ask your newsagent or write to THE TIMES
Subscription Manager.
The exactfigureis 85%. We are aware that this is a little more than
four-fifths: please do not write to point this out. Do write, however, if
you would be interested in an account of the research which produced
these and many other revealingfigures.Who are Top People? What do
they think on the important issues of the day? Write to The Times
(Department SP), Printing House Square, London EC4.
Another healthy feature of your
newspaper is the obvious enthusi-
asm with which the Felix staff
have set about their task of report-
ing news items, and presenting
the other features which make up
your newspaper.
However, I feel that, at times,
last term, the actual standard of
reporting was poor, it being both
childish and irresponsible. Al-
though I would hesitate to claim
that there was actual distortion of
fact, all too often, the presenta-
tion was prejudiced without justi-
fication. Surely it is an Insult
to a University student's intelli-
gence to suppose that what he
wants is shallow sensationalism.
Let's have a newspaper with more
constructive reading matter with
rather less of the meaningless
headlines, and rather less, also, of
material of a superficial character.
A case in point was the front
page story in the last issue of
Felix dealing with the Debating
Society. This article contained
nothing constructive and made
little attempt to recognise any
efforts which are, in fact, being
made to set the Society on its feet
again.
It is fallacious to argue, as you
do, that the present form of Felix
should be maintained since it sells.
The only reason that Felix sells
is because the publicity is first-
rate. Who, of the South Side resi-
dents, can resist the dynamic
saleswomanship to wMch they
are subjected every other Tuesday
evening!
Felix will still sell, provided the
excellent publicity arrangements
are maintained, even if the articles
are of a greater length, with a
more searching, mature treatment,
treatment.
The editorials in the later issues
of Felix last term commanded the
respect they deserved. Why can-
not this be extended throughout
Felix so that it becomes a news-
paper with a certain amount of
dignity and one of which the Col-
lege can be proud.
Yours

There were, I thought, a num-
ber of constructive criticisms of
the Debating Society in my article,
especially concerning the nature
of the motions, and the desira-
bility of introducing outside

Dear Sir,
The College prides itself on the
support which it gives to the many
sides of student activity, and in
general it has good reason. Few
activities with any following are
not catered for, however, the col-
lege has fallen sadly behind de-
mand in the provision of good
pianos and practicing facilities.
It is true that there are pianos
littered around in such intelligent
places as the South Side upper
lounge, the Union staircase and
among the debris of the Concert
hall stage, but these do nothing to
help the situation. The top Re-
fectory boasts a piano which on
a good day might fetch 30/- at a
fumble sale. The Jazz Club piano
is available, understandably, only
to members of the club. Where,
then, can nan-jazz pianists prac-
tice!
The one place where this is pos-
sible (when no-one else is using it
and after 5.30 p.m.) 178 Queens-
gate. And even to practice here
requires three signatures and the
loan of a key from the Union
security guards. The need for at
least a second practicing room
with a good piano is immediate
and urgent, particularly since
none of the new buildings have
done anything at all in this direc-
tion.
When the College is accused of
catering only for Science and
Sport, it is in such cases as this
that the accusations are justified.
Yours etc.,

Dear Sir,
As a resident of Southside, I
was disturbed to see the private
road outside our Hall cluttered up
with motor cars one night last
week. Ho Ho 1 thought, it's a
monster outbreak by students de-
fying the no-parking ban imposed
last term. I thought that I saw
traffic wardens swarming, but they
were chauffeurs in peaked caps,
and surely students don't drive
Rolls Royces, Bentleys and a
Lambretta scooter (Blue and
Grotty Grey). And all those
people were going into the Lybian
Embassy thing.
Grotl I thought. Why should
it be permissable for them to park
their cars in our private road!
Cars look ugly there at any time;
Rolls Royce or Roll-over Bentley
or Bent-tin.
Aesthetically yours,
Yog.

When the Clerk to the Halls of
Residence moved to Southside
two offices were left vacant, with
but one outer door. Two admin,
secretaries moving in were unable
to decide who should have the in-
ner room. A top level conference
was held and the matter was de-
cided, Result: a large hole was
knocked in the wall, and neither
has yet been able to move in.
