MARXIST WEEK
The Communist Society in its
first year of existence has run the
first ever Marxist Week in this
College. Two thousand leaflets
and over 200 posters advertised a
series of meetings intended to
show how the Marxist holds the
key to many questions, political,
economic and cultural, by not
merely asking How? but Why?
Why do people compete instead
of cooperate, produce great works
of art and run countries?
The General Studies lecture by
George Mathews, Editor of the
GRACE
Daily Worker brought the audi-
ence face to face with the realities
of the Press-Lords' monopoly
over our minds. Emeritus Pro-
fessor Hyman Levy ably chaired
the meeting, casting a warm glow
which pleasantly complimented
Mathews' oratory.
The Battleship Potempkin
shown to a packed theatre showed
Eisenstein using the silent medium
of that time to express an instant
in the struggle for Socialism of
the Russian people. By contrast
the shorts showed life as it now is,
and the advances of mind and
machine stimulated by Socialism.
The smaller meetings in the even-
ings have been more intimate
affairs explaining more specialised
aspects of Marxism to those
particularly interested.
A theoretical discourse on Dia-
lectical Materialism given by
Maurice Comforth; a speech
showing the esential role of stu-
dents in the Communist move-
ment; and a Folk Song Evening
terminated our Week. The week

An Industry whose rapid expansion assures a
challenging and exciting future, the Central
Electricity Generating Board offers graduates
wide scope for research and development in an
extraordinary diversity of fields.
A system which demands that the Board's out-
put shall double every nine years, and capital
investment greaterthan any other single organi-
sation in the United Kingdom (at present around
£300 million annually) make a long-term re-
search programme of the highest importance.
We are looking for the graduate who wishes to
embark on a new line of research and to make
his own personal contribution to this pro-
gramme.
There are vacancies for Physicists, Metallur-
gists, Mathematicians, Chemists and Engin-
eers in both fundamental and applied research.
The fields covered include solid state physics,
nuclear instrumentation, fluid dynamics, high
temperature chemistry, fuel cells, behaviour of
materials under extreme conditions and many
others. The most up-to-date equipment is pro-
vided and staff are encouraged to publish
original work.
There are also opportunities in the operational
side of the Industry where a two year training
scheme is available for Electrical and Mech-
anical Engineers and Physicists.

will be" followed up vigorously by
the Society in its regular meetings
—including a weekend seminat on
Science and Marxism towards the
end of term. We hope to have
achieved some heightening of the
political consciousness of students
in this College, and to have'dis-
pelled some of the apathy which
holds the political societies in its
incredible grip.
Departmental
The Materials Section of the
Electrical Engineering Depart-
ment have undertaken a contract
with the British Oxygen Company
to develop a device which will
employ the Ettinghausen effect
for cooling at low temperatures.
B.O.C. will produce the device
itself, while the Home Team will
develop the required materials.
At present it is very difficult to
maintain anything in the tempera-
ture range 22°K to 77°K , and if
the device succeeds it will be a
significant achievement as this
range is a most useful one for
the operation of certain semi-
conductors.
It is also hoped that it will be
possible to replace the expensive
helium memory of very high speed
computers with liquid nitrogen,
super-cooled by the Ettinghausen
device.
Humanities
A look at the Second Year
Electrical Engineer's Humanities
course programme for this term
should make students of all other
departments see that their general
education is being sadly, if not
criminally, neglected. This splen-
did course, devised and directed
by Mr. J. S. Goodlad, includes an
historical survey of the 20th Cen-
tury, featuring the causes of the
two wars, and of wars in general,
the Dust Bowl of Central America
which inspired Steinbeck's
"Grapes of Wrath," and the
Great Depression; a drama^^Ur-
vey; lessons in public speaking;
two lectures by Mr. Roberf Mc-
Kenzie of B.B.C. fame on the
British Political Parties; lecture
courses in Social Anthropology,
Psychology and Political Science.
The course is enlivened by a num-
ber of films of a high standard—
for example Olivier's " Hamlet,"
" The Grapes of Wrath," " Pre-
lude to War" by the U.S. War
Department.
Weekend in Paris
At the end of last term two third
year Electrical engineers went to
Paris at the Department's expense.
Contrary to certain malicious ru-
mours, the show they went to see
was the MESUCORA Exposition
of Light Electrical Engineering
products. Their principal aim was
to compare British products with
those of other countries, in par-
ticular with regard to techno-
logical development. Their find-
ings were presented to the rest of
their " Year " the following week
when they gave a lecture and
answered questions.
