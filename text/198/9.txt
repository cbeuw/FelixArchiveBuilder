I.C. Scratch VIII came near to
causing chaos in the Plum Pud-
ding race held shortly after the
end of last term. This is an affair
where the slowest VIII's start
first and the fastest last, conse-
quently around Hammersmith
Bridge 16 VIIFs were fighting to
get under the bridge with room
for not more than 6. Here the
I.C. Scratch VIII helped in the
boat jam. They had pounded up
the course in a series of gentle
S's and collided with the I.C. Ill's
who had been going great guns
and a Thames crew. The Scratch
VIII came out in front but were
shortly overtaken.
The first VIII had a fine row.
Starting twelve seconds in front
of Thames I they finished 4 se-
conds ahead ; no mean achieve-
ment. Unfortunately the Thames
2nd VIII were better and just
beat I.C. to the prize, a barrel of
beer.

SMITHS Slammed

Imperial took the field at Harlington having played the
" Smiths " twice already in the season losing once and drawing once.
The addition of 6 of the University 1st X I and one of the 2nd X I
n the occasion of cup-ties changes the team unrecognisably, how-
ever, and previous results mean nothing.
The first ten minutes when
both sides were testing each other
ended with Eastell scoring for
I.C. from close-quarters after a
goalmouth scramble. The game
then swung from end to end
and both defences were tested,
but I.C. were more dangerous in
attack, especially on the right
where Stoddart rounded his back
at will, helped by excellent ser-
vice from two other University
players, Casemore and Huxtable,
playing inside him. Goldsmiths,
too, were lively in attack but
lacked that final thrust to pierce
a defence which was curbing its
natural attackins instinct.
The stalemate ended when
Vaughan fastened on to a defen-
sive error and beat the goal-
keeper with a well-placed shot
giving I.C. a 2-0 lead at half-time.
The second half opened with
I.C. attacking and that was how
it continued for practically the
whole 45 minutes. The middle of

Are you nosey? It's the up and
coming thing to be in Southside.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not
talking about residents using
shaving mirrors tied on to broom-
sticks to find out who their near-
est neighbours are entertaining,
nor am I referring to any sudden
increase in the monitoring of stu-
dent activities by the powers that
the field was under the home
team's domination ; consequently
I.C.'s forwards were ployed with
chances. Only one was con-
verted, however, when Vaughan
scored Bis second following a
goalmouth melee. I.C. had the
game well in hand when Fisher,
playing his usual " solid " game
at right back, raced through to
score from 30 yards with a net
rattling shot to show the forwards
how easy it was.

In the past, members of the
club have taken part in several
long distance events such as the
"Three Peaks'" race in.Derby-
shire and the Land's End to John
O'Groats Relay. This Easter the
club plans to pioneer a race of
its own invention called the
"Three Peaks Relay"! The
rules for the course will be simply
that the race will start and finish
at sea level, and will take in the
highest peaks in England, Scot-
land and Wales ; namely Scafell
Pike, Ben Nevis and Snowdon.
Apart from the fact that it will
take 70 hours to cover the 400
miles between Fort William and
Caernarvon, there are other con-
siderable difficulties to overcome.
For instance, it is not certain
whether it will be possible to run
all the mountains in daylight.
Naturally an event of this nature
will involve many people. In
addition to the ten runners that
will be doing the relay, there will

sniffed at. The ground is our
own. Home advantage. What
advantage is that ? Well, besides
knowing the pitch better, the
home side gets all the cheers
from the crowd. The bigger the
crowd, the bigger the advantage

Despite, or perhaps because of,
the fact that a vital cup match
