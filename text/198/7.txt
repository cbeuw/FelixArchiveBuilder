LIBERALISM
by CHRISTOPHER L A Y T O N
In different ways, all three political parties are now talking about
modernising Britain. Their success will depend on two things—
whether they can give the economy a new dynamic, and whether they
can reshape our machinery of Government to suit modern needs.
The two are linked. Though growth depends on many things
outside administration—like promoting competition and efficiency'—
the poor state of industrial confidence and investment is the direct
consequence of the Government's failure to give sustained growth
top priority. And that in turn has sprung from the failure to plan
ahead and perceive that every government objective—schools, homes,
aid, even the strength of sterling—depends on sustained growth.
Neddy
The setting up of Neddy is a
first step. Planning has become
an O.K. word'even in Tory cir-
cles. Industry now accepts that
the Government should do what
every major firm does—think
ahead.
But Neddy has shortcomings.
Many of Neddy's excellent ideas,
from redundancy to regionalism,
are not accepted by the Govern-
ment. And no-one really knows
what authority they have. There
is no sign whatever that Mr.
Marples or Sir Keith Joseph is
taking any notice whatever of
Neddy's recommendations. In-
deed Dr. Beeching's proposals
would accelerate a drift to the
Manchester-London coffin which
Neddy hopes to stop.
A Minister for Expansion
To put this right requires
broader changes than the mere
manufacture of new Ministries.
Perhaps, indeed, there are too
many already. There is far too
little long-term thinking or plan-
ning and too much petty interven-
tion in daily life.
The Liberal Party's proposals
for the reform of administration
are designed to try to put this
right.
We have suggested, first, that
the economic staff of Neddy
should be promoted and placed
under a Minister, whom we call
the Minister for Expansion. This
Minister would have real power.
The Treasury and Board of Trade
would take guidance from him.
mates are too narrow and special-
ised to be useful.
The Minister would become
Chairman of the existing Council
of Neddy, where industry and
unions are represented. In the
formation of an effective incomes
policy the Council plainly has a
key part to play. Equally, the
new sub-committees of Neddy are
crucial. Here the detail of the
plan can be put together, and the
planners can educate industry to
the implications of expansion.
Responsibility
But ultimate responsibility for
the plan must rest with the
Government, and with a specific
Minister. Only a government
representative can go to an indi-
vidual industry and tell it with
conviction that Government
policy will be designed to achieve
certain goals. It is to Parliament,
not to the Council of employers
and unions, that the Government
the Labour Party, Liberals seek
to decentralise the detailed execu-
tion of planning from Whitehall.
Our Town Clerk, struggling to get
a factory or even to get a decision
on the placing of a kerbstone,
has not only to cope with several
different ministries but to press
for a decision at several levels of
government — borough, county
and Whitehall itself. There is too
little planning and too much red-
tape.
In our conception central gov-
ernment must lay down the broad
lines of economic policy and guide
resources to the areas which need
development.
But elected regional councils
should draw up plans for their
own regions and execute them—
through development corporations
of their own, for instance, which
would finance new industries and
housing consortia. In the siting
BIOGRAPHICAL
The Hon. Christopher Layton, son of Lord Layton, the Liberal
Peer, lost the 1962 Chippenham by-election by only 1,500 votes while
pushing the Labour candidate into third place. He is personal execu-
tive to Mr. Grimond, and also the Liberal Party spokesman on
Economic Affairs. Educated at Oundle and Cambridge he has
served in industry with ICI and also in Fleet Street with " The
Economist."
must finally answer for the plan.
Another suggestion is that the
top planning body should be in
the Prime Minister's office. This
would be to go for a presidential
system with a vengeance. I believe
TWO KINDS OF
Conservative policies of course
have never been part of a thought
out design for society or the
economy; they are improvisations.
But the tendency to go off in all
directions is enhanced by weak-
nesses in our Government ma-
chine. Within , the Cabinet,
Ministers are all too often defend-
ing departmental interests. And
you do not have to be in the
Cabinet to find this out. If you
are a local government official
struggling to get a new factory for
your town you may be -asking the
Board of Trade for a Licence
'while the Minister of Transport
is busy cutting off the branch line
and the Ministry of Housing &
Local Government is failing to
provide the money for the new
houses you need. In economic
policy itself, while the Board of
Trade is responsible—in pedantic
detail—for the siting of new fac-
tories and for development areas,
the Treasury has been responsible
(with considerable caution) for
the fiscal measures that would
encourage new factories ot set up.
No one is responsible for the re-
gional policies which Neddy
recommends, except, rather
vaguely, Lord Hailsham in the
North.
So, in broad economic matters,
would other Ministers. He would
have responsibility for the plan,
for seeing it was carried out, and,
above all, for answering to Parlia-
ment.
This last responsibility is of
crucial importance, for we en-
visage a much closer working re-
lationship between Parliament
and the executive on economic
matters than exists today. The
Liberal five-year plan for Britain,
ana one-year plans to implement
it, would be put to Parliament for
approval. Like the French
chamber, Parliament would de-
bate different target '-rates of
growth, with their implications
for investment, consumption and
public spending.
Economic Affairs Committee
One of the key all-party stand-
ing committees we would like to
see set up in the Housedof Com-
mons would be the committee for
economic affairs. Its members
should work closely with the
members of the economic ministry
in both the formulation and the
development and execution of the
plan. Five-year budgets would
enable Members to relate Govern-
ment spending to the plan. Too
often today debates on the Esti-
that the delegation of authority on
which our Cabinet system is based
is more efficient. But just as the
Government has rightly brought
defence policy under a single
Minister, so economic policy
must be brought under one man.
How does this conception re-
semble or differ from the Labour
Party's? Labour wants a senior
M!nister in charge of economic
of industry, for example, a total
amount of factory space might
usefully be allocated to each
region, ;but the decision where
factories should be placed would
be left to the regions themselves.
Such decentralisation would make
possible a real slimming in White-
hall as well as a better division
of responsibility between broad
national policy and execution on
the spot.
Universities and Research
The differences between the two
philosophies on the Left can be
found again in the instruments of
planning. Liberals would solve
by allowing the market to operate
but taxing the benefits of growth
for the community. Labour in-
tends to nationalise all develop-
ment land. In science, Liberals
would encourage the regions to set
up their own universities and
spur on diversity in research.
PLANNING
planning. But so far there are
fewer signs that Labour is in-
terested in a radical reform of the
civil service. And Mr. Wilson is
evidently anxious to divide re-
sponsibility for economic policy
rather than put one man in
charge.
Nor has the Labour Party yet
shown interest in Parliamentary
control of planning on economic
policy, which we believe to be
crucial if it is to work and com-
mand informed popular support.
Decentralisation
Above all, in stark contrast with
Labour would bring university
research under Government con-
trol. Labour still believes that
the state must both plan and
execute planning decisions. We
believe in a plural society in which
the task of government is to hold
the ring* and create circumstances
in which groups and individuals
serve the common needs.
Here is one aspect of Liberal
policy. It is a key one. It shows
that Liberal thinking is forward
looking and practical. It adds to
other Liberal proposals to help
create a modern up-to-date
society.
