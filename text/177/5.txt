Informal Dances, two Carnivals, the Com-
memoration Ball, November 5,th, the Mines
Ball, the Engineers Dinner and Dance, a
Smoking Concert, the I.C.W.A. Formal, the
May Ball, the R.C.S. Silwood Ball—pay
your money and take your choice—who does?
Is it always the same people more or less?
Some seem to appear at all the various fun-
ctions and to enjoy them all. How many of
the (often quoted) 3,000 never attend any of
them? and why? Even if you take no act-
ive interest in College activities a Ball, or
Carnival is provided for you, all that you
have to do is to come, find out how much
you enjoy it, and wonder afterwards why
you never came to one before.
Do you consider it too expensive? The
majority of the main functions are subsidised
either by I.C. Union or by one of the constit-
uent College Unions, the Union Building
provides the amenities-gratis, the arrangement
of the bands, decorations, buffet, etc., which
naturally cost money is carried out by the
various entertainment committees concerned,
but the work involved, as in all the various
clubs and societies, is voluntary. Where else
will you find this, particularly once you
have left College. I do not, of course, suggest
that everyone should attend everything—but
surely everyone could afford both the time,
and money to grace one function during'
each of their years at College, and discover
how much they will enjoy a good, pleasant,
and generally well organised Ball and/or;
Carnival at a very reasonable (cheap) price
Thus with all your problems solved I hope
that next year anyone (everyone) who has
attended nothing this year will make an ef-
fort to attend at least one of the functions
which are organised for you and I am cer-
tain that having been to one you will want
to go to many more. Ask anyone who has
been this year.
