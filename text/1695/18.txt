When a rare heat wave hits London in summer, it’s nice to get out of the city and head to the beach for some sun,
sea, and fish & chips. Going to famous European resorts can be expensive and time-consuming but don’t worry,
we’ve got you covered – here’s a guide to some affordable seaside destinations close to London.
W
ith the
upcoming
s u m m e r
b r e a k ,
many of us will want to
get away from busy and
polluted London and
relax on the beach. I can’t
count the times I was
tempted to buy a plane
ticket to Spain or Greece
for a weekend just to treat
myself to some sun and
sea. However, flight costs
can skyrocket to over
£200 one way in summer,
even with budget airlines
like Ryanair. Ain’t paying
that! Luckily, the south
coast of England boasts
lovely beach towns, some
of which can easily rival
the popular Mediterranean
resorts. Plus, they can be
a convenient last-minute
choice for a day trip on
those rare occasions
when the temperatures in
London reach the unbe-
lievable 30o
C.
Bournemouth
This lovely town was
a pleasant surprise to me.
The beaches in the region
are sandy, although it’s
on the same coastline as
Brighton which I visited
a few years back and
where I couldn’t walk
barefoot on the sharp
pebbles (which felt more
like shards!). But Bourne-
mouth is totally different:
the warm golden sand was
a pleasure to both walk on
and look at. The tall cliffs
with fancy villas on top,
separating the seashore
from the streets, offer
breath-taking views of the
beaches from above and
are perfect spots to slow
down, relax, and enjoy the
moment.
I didn’t get to explore
the town much since I
opted for the whole day
on the beach, enjoying the
Beachbetterhavemymoney:affordableseasidedestinations
sun, warm water, and a
refreshing sea breeze that
was much needed on such
a hot day. I walked along
the coast towards Poole (to
the west of Bournemouth)
and was not disappointed
by the mesmerising views
of the sea on one side and
the cliffs on the other. To
this day, Bournemouth is
my #1 recommendation
for a beach trip in England
Broadstairs
Broadstairs is another
seaside town with sand
beaches, located in the
South-East, less than two
hours away from London
by train. It prides itself on
being home to the Viking
Bay, where Charles
Dickens used to spend
his holidays back in the
day. Despite being a small
town, it’s a popular des-
tination on hot summer
weekends, especially
for families with small
children, so the beach
might get a bit crowded
and loud. Not to worry
though – you can still
find somewhat quieter
and emptier places by the
sea (walking a bit further
away from the main beach
will do the trick). Also,
the place boasts amazing
white cliffs, characteristic
of South-East England,
that are a treat not only
for your eyes but also for
your Instagram feed (hey,
no judgement, we all do
it!).
Hastings
Situated around a two
and a half hour drive from
London, Hastings offers a
range of leisure activities
besides sunbathing and
swimming. The beach
itself is pebbly, so may
not be as nice as the
sandy ones mentioned
before. But I visited the
place on a rather cool and
windy summer day, when
swimming wasn’t much
of an option anyway, so

instead we hiked up the
hills via a trail that was of-
ficially closed (#thuglife)
and savoured the beautiful
panorama of the city and
the beach from above.
We also visited the
ruins of Hastings castle
and spent some quality
time sitting and chatting
on the beach, with the
calming sound of waves
in the background.
Southend-on-Sea
Probably one of the
closest beach destinations
to London, Southend-
on-Sea is not nearly as
appealing as others. Both
the sand and the water are
rather dirty, and the beach
is full of broken glass and
other rubbish. However, it
has the longest pier in the
world and is probably the
most convenient place to
go to by public transport.
But in my opinion, it’s
worth travelling a bit
further from London for
a more fulfilling beach
experience.
Last tips
Most of the southern
and south-eastern desti-
nations are around two
hours away from London
and can be conveniently
reached by direct trains
or buses. You might even
be able to score some
affordable train tickets,
especially to places like
Broadstairs. And when
you go there, don’t forget
to get some fish and
chips, an integral part
of your British seaside
experience! But beware
of seagulls – if you have
food on the beach, they
will definitely try to
snatch it from you, even if
you’re holding it in your
hands (been there one too
many times: getting my
Tesco meal-deal sandwich
stolen was one of the
saddest moments of my
life).

Earlier this year we published a series of articles about a group of students hiking in Corsica, a challenging
expedition funded by IC Exploration Board. The Board is now funding another exciting hiking trip in Crete, and
the team went on a training weekend in Dartmoor, England to prepare.
Dartmoor training weekend: rehearsal for hiking in Crete
Niamh French

O
ur team leader
Georgios had
asserted him-
self early on by
arriving to our training
weekend in a blindingly
stylish grey-and-butter-
cup-yellow outfit. We will
be hiking across the Greek
island of Crete for three
weeks this September
with the financial support
of Imperial’s Exploration
Board, and we picked
Dartmoor as a place to try
out our new equipment.
It was an early evening
when we arrived so we
needed to get to our river-
side camping spot before
the light of the sunset cast
the moors the same warm
yellow as Georgios’ coat.
With backpacks hoisted
onto our shoulders, we
made our way through the
long grass to Bellever Tor
(one of Dartmoor’s high
points). The panorama
from the Tor revealed
the charming landscape
waiting for us, which
we admired cheerfully
in the company of three
wild horses. A short walk
downhill past a forest
carpeted in soft moss
took us to the riverbank
where we would sleep – a
peaceful spot sheltered
by gentle hills. We won’t
be using tents in Crete,
instead we will be sleeping
under the stars wrapped in
sleeping bags and bivy
bags to protect us from the
elements, and so we didn’t
use tents in Dartmoor
either. One of the main
advantages of using bivy
bags is their rapid set up.
Here’s a quick guide to
our approach: lay down
an emergency blanket
silver-side-up to keep the
dew out and the heat in,
inflate your sleeping mat,
unroll your sleeping bag
and bivy bag.
It was getting late and
darkness was creeping in
but we still hadn’t eaten.
This was not the time
for cooking disasters,
and yet… Fire singed
the hair from Georgios’
arms. Michail shielded his
eyes. I commando-rolled
away as the flaming
stove arched through the
air and tumbled into the
river. Our pile of spilt rice
was instantly blackened.
Between our seven sci-
entific minds it had not
occurred to us to keep our
stoves more than 15cm
apart from each other or
our faces. The result was a
rapidly expanding ball of
flame. We had learnt our
first lesson.
With a new level of
respect for health and
safety, we tucked into
lentils, rice, onion, carrot,
and some wispy poached
egg. We collected our
waste in a bin bag and
wrapped the remaining
bags around our back-
packs to keep them dry.
Sleeping in a bivy bag
is somewhat like being
wrapped up in a sock
that’s floating through
space. Every time you
open your eyes you are
met with a sea of stars,
crossed by the occasional
satellite and centered on
the moon. Only the scent
of grass reminds you
that you’re still on Earth.
However, we woke to a
less romantic scene. The
condensation of our breath
had left our bivy bags wet,
and the cold night air was
pinching our noses. We
learnt our second lesson:
wear balaclavas, and
only use a bivy bag if it is
raining.
The clock struck 4am
and we sprung awake,
packing up under the light
of our head torches and
shivering sleepily. A quick
hike back to Bellever Tor
warmed us up, and we
timed it perfectly with the
sunrise. A deep stillness
hung in the air, pierced
only by birdsong and
the stirring music from
someone’s phone. Not a
word was spoken while
the glowing sun broke
the horizon. We were
entranced.
We breakfasted on
tahini, porridge, and nuts,
while Carla smashed
out a navigation crash
course, preparing us to
take turns by guiding the
team around the moors.
We passed ancient ar-
chaeological sites, fell
into squelching bogs,
and came dangerously
close to farm guard dogs.
Our faces tanned and our
spirits stayed high despite
the occasional blister.
When lunchtime came,
we hopped across some
stepping stones and
dipped our feet in the cool,
clear river. Our lunch was
the same as our previous
night’s dinner, although
now more skillfully
cooked and with no fire-re-
lated panic. We scrubbed
our pans clean with sand
and river water, making
a mental note to pack
biodegradable soap and a
scouring pad for Crete. As
much as we would have
liked to explore Dartmoor
further, we needed to get
back to the cars and our
London lives.
The majestic sunrise was well worth the early start // Niamh French
A couple of hours
through forests and fields
brought our trip to an end.
We have come away with
lessons learnt, a strong
team dynamic, and smiles
on our faces, now all the
more excited to begin our
expedition across Crete.
“Every time
you open your
eyes you are

the scent of
grass reminds
you that you’re
still of Earth”
