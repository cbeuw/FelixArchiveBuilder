On creating a legacy
Students may not always realise it, but they have the power to make a
lasting change at university.

their assumed trajectory
at a moment’s notice at
inflection points. In life,
too, there are certain
times the prevailing
greater wisdom considers
to be inflection points –
often-pivotal moments
that mark so-called mile-
stones. Examples include
graduation and marriage.
Characteristically, the
passing of such moments
has a final and enduring
influence on us.
In reality, changes in
life are rarely so instan-
taneous. Most progress in
life is gradual. Nowadays,
the accepted cultural norm
is for significant milestone
moments to be marked
with a shiny plaque, cer-
tificate, or perhaps wide-
spread media recognition;
nevertheless, these are
essentially snapshots of a
lifetime of marginal gains.
Change itself is a
two-sided platform and
not a unilateral, unidi-
rectional effort. It natu-
rally follows then that all
students change when they
arrive at their university
and leave behind a legacy
of some sort when they
depart. Their classmates,
lecturers, and even the
buildings themselves will
be irrevocably changed by
their presence. Leaving a
student legacy is assured.
If so, perhaps, it would
be valuable to consider
the student experience
not only as a time for
personal academic growth
–learning, for example,
every metabolite in the
Citric acid cycle – but as
a prime opportunity to
leave behind a positive
lasting impact on your
peers as well.
David Rubenstein,
co-founder of The Carlyle
Group, one of the most
successful private equity
firms in the world, is often
quoted explaining that
philanthropy is more than
just rich people giving
money away; rather, it
can be ‘money, time, or
ideas’. As such, in this
hyper-connected world,
there is no reason to wait
to give in feasible and
logistically acceptable
ways. Legacy, like phi-
lanthropy, can be ‘money,
time, or ideas’. Reaping
the emotional and intel-
lectual rewards of leaving
behind a positive legacy is
too valuable to restrict to
the end of life.
holistic and three-dimen-
sional development. One
way to frame this idea
in context is to consider
the merits and specific
requirements behind
leaving a personalised
legacy during the multi-
tudes of journeys that lead
to the inflection points in
our overall life journey.
As graduates know, the
contact details they leave
behind will be used ex-
tensively for the purposes
of soliciting monetary
donations and other forms
of support for institutional
advancement. The impact
that can be had with this
type of philanthropy is
profound, yet it is inevita-
bly delayed.
It may feel like an
enormous burden to take
on more ‘responsibility’
during a time of high
stresses, but a sense of
purpose creates fulfil-
ment. To think how each
assignment and personal
interaction could be
further pursued to create
widespread positive
lasting impact on their
institution, and even so-
ciety-at-large, can be very
rewarding.
Regret usually stems
from what has not been
done. From anecdotal
and personal experience,
it is not the temporary
embarrassment that ac-
companies a ‘bad’ choice
or decision that plagues
the mind forever. The
CV of failures is long
or short, depending on
your luck, genetics, and
circumstances, but it is
the feeling of not knowing
what could have been that
stays forever in the mind.
It is universal and waiting
to be triggered, especially
during important defining
moments – inflection
points.
In summary, to leave
behind an exceptional
legacy as a student is
simple:
1. Be uncomfortably
vocal
2. Reach out far
beyond your imme-
diate peer group
3. Listen, read and
think about how
things should be
On positive change
I
t has been an enormous privilege to be
your Campaigns Officer this year. To see the
dynamism and enthusiasm that transcends
our university campuses when various
campaigns jump into action has been not only
educational, but most enjoyable.
This year I spearheaded a campaign of my
own, called SleepImperial, to promote healthy
sleeping habits amongst staff and students. The
amount of energy and effort required to deliver
this campaign successfully was, I admit, much
morethanIhadinitiallyexpectedorintended.To
effectively communicate with key stakeholders
delivering events, obtain funding for a website,
and draft in professionals to design graphics
to be projected across high-profile screens
across campus – to name just a small selection
of jobs – was most challenging. Coupled with
being on geographically distant placements
that were intertwined with key interviews
and examinations made for bittersweet and,
on reflection, entertaining memories. To join
SleepImperial, and for top sleep-related tips,
please visit: www.sleepimperial.com
I am enormously grateful for the support
across all levels of the university, from students
themselves to senior staff. Seeing the impact
that can be had with campaigns has justified the
very real and personal sacrifices made.
As the organisational structure of the
students’ union changes, and the broader
education curriculum reform begins, of which I
had the chance to be a part, the need to be the
force for change has never been more relevant.
In the end, the nature of student-led
campaigns leads to the need to be creative and
resourceful. Compromise will be an integral
part of moving forward, and by embracing
differences we can build better synergies,
creating better solutions.
The mark of a successful campaign lies
in its longevity. Making the transition from a
founder-driven movement to that sustained
by equally enthused and passionate leaders
is the most challenging part of leaving behind
lasting positive change. If it can be done, it is the
ultimate reward. Put simply, people will always
need to be helped by people.

“Leaving
behind a
positive legacy
is too valuable
to restrict to
the end of our
lives”
At their best, educa-
tional institutions provide
students with the safety
of a semi-structured cur-
riculum to make marginal
gains in all aspects of life,
that will ultimately be
rewarded with the assur-
ance of a piece of paper
that certifies the culmina-
tion of their achievement.
Such development for
individuals is impressive,
but somewhat well-cir-
cumscribed and linear.
Arguably, branching out
with intention laterally
would provide for a more
“Leaving a
legacy of a
positive nature
is something
that can be
done as a
student”
It would be regrettable
if future generations,
some of the brightest
minds not yet known, miss
out on the joys of giving
early, for lack of knowl-
edge, encouragement, or
support. By thinking a bit
more laterally, a bit more
broadly, and a bit more
bigger-picture, student life
could become even more
transformative for the
vast majority of students.
Leaving a lasting legacy of
a positive nature is some-
thing that can be done as
a student. It is not about
going out of your way to
disrupt current practices.
It is about paying attention
to positive behaviours and
attitudes, and making
a conscious choice to
promote them in your own
unique way. Building a
legacy and reputation that
puts the spotlight on your
uniquely valuable char-
acter and potential is not
something that needs to
be left for a time beyond
middle-age.
It begins today.
