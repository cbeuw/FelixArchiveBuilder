The revision soundtrack you wish you had this year
The Felix Music Editor-delinquents planned out this piece, like, three weeks ago, but they didn’t publish it until
now by fault of a stunning lack of functionality. Oh, and exams and all that. We are mortal men after all.
R
ight in time for
the end of exam
season, the
usual suspects
rec some LPs that you
should’ve been listening
to all along. Sucks you
don’t have a time ma-
chine, or you could’ve
had that many more
hours of pleasant revision
coasting emotionally on
the bangin’ tunes we tell
you to like. Well, there’s
always next year...
E.MO.TION
Carly Rae Jepsen
fame, Rostam Batmanglij,
and Este Haim, resulting
in an album defined by
smooth baselines, funky
melodies, and catchy
hooks. The whole thing
just… bops. Trust me.
So, you might be
asking, why would you
recommend an album that
is the complete antithesis
of ambiance? An LP
consisting of tracks that
would never be seen dead
on a ‘Deep Focus’ Spotify
mix? Well, the reason I
recommend E.MO.TION
as a revision album is
because there’s much
more to revision than
simply studying hard.
To revise properly, you
need to get into the right
mindset – the ‘I’m gonna
show this exam who’s
boss because I’m amazing
and nobody can tell me
different’ mindset. Jepsen
can help with that. Next
time you’re feeling like
you’re at the end of your
tether, just take a quick
break, and put on this
album. Trust me – as soon
as the iconic saxophone
intro kicks in on opener
‘Run Away with Me’,
you’ll start to feel a whole
lot better. By ‘I Really
LikeYou’you’ll be feeling
confident enough to take
on the world, and by the
time ‘LA Hallucinations’
is queued up, you’re
gonna be ready to plough
on with your quantum
physics notes. God bless
you Carly Rae Jepsen.

The Disintegration
Loops
William Basinski
Loops are different from
other ambient music;
while we are listening to
repeated samples, each
time the sound plays, it’s
slightly different than
what came before. Over
the course of an entire
loop, the sound will
change with imperceptible
slowness, from a relative-
ly clear sample, through
to a murky sludge. What
you’re listening to is, quite
literally, the effect of time
and decay, transmuted
into music; the recordings
are romantic and incred-
ibly moving, creating a
sense of doubly-removed
temporal distance – we
are listening to sound
that first existed nearly 40
years ago, and has come
to us through a variety
of permutations, like the
light from a distant star.
In total, the four loops
run to nearly five hours in
length, meaning – to bring
us back to cold practical-
ities for a minute – they
are excellent for timing
revision breaks. When I
wasdeepinrevisionmode,
I would listen to the whole
thing straight through, and
then finish up for the day.
On a more philosophical
level, the album reminds
us that everything fades
eventually; the universe
has one direction, and that
is towards decay. Puts that
fluid mechanics module
into perspective.

Baduizm
Erykah Badu
If you’re stuck in the
computer lab, feeling like
your life is going nowhere,
then don’t listen to this
album. Erykah Badu was
only 24 when she released
‘On & On’, the first single
from her debut Baduizm,
helping kick-start the
neo-soul renaissance, and
becoming an instant icon
of modern music. You’ve
still got a few more years,
but – let’s be real here –
you’re never gonna beat
that.
retains a sense of amused
detachment. She’s the
perfect companion for a
hard day of revision. She
even has Drake’s seal of
approval – he raps about
going over to her house
for a cup of tea and advice
about love in ‘Days in the
East’. If she can get Driz-
zy through his distrust of
the modern world, she can
get you through another
day in Central Library.

The commercial
success that has escaped
E.MO.TION, the musical
masterpiece of Canadian
pop queen Carly Rae
Jepsen, is one of the
greatest injustices of the
modern music industry.
Don’t @ me.
The twelve songs that
make up the album, as
well as the eight that
were included in the EP
of B-sides, are, without
exception, stone cold
bangers. Jepsen enlisted
the help of a wide range of
producers, including Dev
Hynes, of Blood Orange
William Basinski’s
Disintegration Loops are
not only a brilliant piece
of ambient music, perfect
for long days revising in
the library, but they come
with their own evocative
backstory. The recordings
were produced when
Basinski was transferring
early recordings made on
magnetic tape to digital
format; as the tape loop
passed through the tape
head, the magnetic ferrite
would slowly flake off,
resulting in a gradual
degradation of sound. If
this wasn’t already mean-
ingful enough, Basinski
completed the project the
morning of 9/11, listening
to the final recordings on
his Brooklyn rooftop as
plumes of smoke on Man-
hattan Island signalled the
beginning of a new global
era.
The Disintegration
Baduizm was released
over 20 years ago, and yet
still retains a freshness.
Fromtheopener,‘Rimshot
(Intro)’, it’s clear we’re in
the presence of a vision-
ary: anchored by slick
bass licks, overlayed with
relaxed beats, and then
topped off with Badu’s
melodic, instantly-recog-
nisable voice, Baduizm
was one of the best albums
released in the 1990s, and
helped pave the way for
innumerable women in
music, with a direct line
to modern albums like
Solange’s A Seat at the
Table or Janelle Monaé’s
The Archandroid.
The hour-long album
moves through a series of
moods, but Badu always
My time as an Imperial
student officially came
to an end on Friday and,
during my four years
here, I have come to the
harsh realisation that I
have the attention span of
a gnat. I struggle to focus
on revision for more than
half an hour and, without
music, my falling asleep
in the blink of an eye is
almost inevitable. Having
said that, if the music is
too engaging, it becomes
a distraction and I get little
to nothing done. My go
to for revision is smooth
R&B. The chilled, lo-fi
production creates the
perfect atmosphere condu-
cive to making those brain
gains. Sampha’s iconic
2017 album Process is
ideal for studying. On the
album, he expresses the
emotions of loss, love, and
growth within multiple
tracks, using his unique
voice to tell the story of
his mother’s passing. The
album served to prove
why his talent has him as
one of the most trusted
collaborators in the
industry, working with the
likes of Drake, Solange,
and more. Sampha’s
smooth vocals overlay
subtle instrumentals and,
as a result, Process makes
for an overall calm and
soothing listening expe-
rience. It is perfect for
revision because it relaxes
me, allowing me to get in
the right frame of mind to
study, and it doesn’t serve
to distract. Process also
has the added bonus of
being engaging enough to
pay attention to the lyrics
during your breaks and get
lost in Sampha’s world.

CTRL
SZA
written almost entirely
from the perspective of a
sidechick. For too long,
the women on the side
have been neglected in the
music industry and SZA’s
album plays a pivotal
role in shining a light
onto their plight, raising
awareness and starting
a necessary dialogue on
proper mistress manage-
ment.” All jokes aside,
SZA’s beautiful voice
shines on CTRL and the
album marks a departure
from the more ethereal
sound of her previous
mixtape efforts.

Beat Tape 2
Tom Misch
Yes Lawd!
NxWorries
reminding you of the
good times ahead. With
tracks like ‘Jodi’, ‘Side-
piece’, and ‘Lyk Dis’, Yes
Lawd! will undoubtedly
put a smile on your face,
despite being trapped in
the sweaty confines of
Central Library. To be
honest, I could recom-
mend any Anderson .Paak
because I am of the firm
belief that everybody
needs some .Paak in their
lives. However his solo
music tends to take a more
upbeat, groovy direction
which some may find too
distracting for revision
in comparison to his
collaborative output with
NxWorries. Save albums
like his solo effort Malibu
for a quick dance during
your break.

Harmony in Ultra-
violet
Tim Hecker
It has elements of that
feeling of coziness during
a rainstorm; there’s just a
hint of malaise – a pinch
of decay – a drop of grit
– maybe just a little bit of
the ol’ too-bummed-to-
feel-my-extremities, just
like you, you sad-sack
haven’t-slept-in-three-
days walking corpse of a
student in exam season.
Well, frankly, it’s hard to
pin down. The whole point
is the vibe, not virtuosic
displays of technicality, or
deep lyricism to read into,
or some tragic backstory
about how the Guy Who
Made The Happy Album
Really Wanted to Kill
Himself And That’s Why
I Listen, Because I’m 14
And Appreciate the Clus-
terfuck That Is Human
Emotion, and if that vibe
is difficult to succinctly
express, well, maybe
that’s a hint that the album
is nice and nuanced.
I’ll give you more
than a hint, though: the
album is deeply, deeply
rich. There’s no need for
flashy technicality; the
beautifully-architected
soundscape and the com-
plexity of the mood so
effectively evoked by the
album cement its position
in my pantheon of adored
albums; the handy fact
that it’s a slow-paced
instrumental album makes
it pretty good to study
with. Go forth and enjoy,
you sorry lot of strung out
math dorks.

In 2017, SZA dropped
her stellar debut album
CTRL. The album was
met with overwhelming
critical acclaim and,
although she was snubbed
by the Grammys, she did
take home “R&B Album
of the Year” at the 3rd
Annual NeighbourHOOD
Grammys (shameless
plug!). To quote Neigh-
bourHOOD Grammys
Committee member,
Jamell Samuels, “CTRL

Shoutout to my brother,
Josh, for putting me on
to this album. I recently
discovered Tom Misch
and was thoroughly
impressed with his most
recent album, Geography,
which dropped in April.
Much like Geography,
Beat Tape 2 is a smooth,
chilled offering which
serves to highlight
Misch’s musicality and
instrumentation. Unlike
Geography, on Beat Tape
2, Misch allows his vocals
to take a backseat, letting
the multiple featured
artists take control of the
singing (and rapping, in
Loyle Carner’s case) over
the top of his production.

Yes Lawd! is the 2016
collaborative effort of
NxWorries, a group
comprising eccentric
vocalist Anderson .Paak
and producer Knxwledge.
Anderson .Paak is the
epitome of a unique
artist and it is difficult
to categorise his eclectic
style and to put into words
exactly what he brings to
the table.
This, fellas, is a heckin’
good album. It’s got a real
transcendental gloom to it
– I like listening to Foreign
Policy’s ER podcast with
it goin’ in the background.
There’s just something
nice about how the bro-
ken-up-over-the-shitty-
phone-link conversations
about the Impending End
of the World and whether
Amazonian natives have
the right to kill disabled
newborns goes so nicely
over a grimy chorus of
harsh noise; and yet,
Hecker pulls naught but
the loveliest of harmonies
out of seemingly nowhere.
There’s a reason why this
album has topped the lists
of many an ambient album
reviewer, and it ain’t the
cover.
The exact vibe is pretty
difficult to pin down.
Well, hey, this is a
spread about albums to
study to. If we’re doing the
“variations on a theme”
thing, that theme might as
well be crippling depres-
sion, because nothing else
quite sums up the mood of
exam-time Imperial.
I kid; this album isn’t
quite as dour as you might
suspect from the first par-
agraph. It is, however, de-
cidedly mellow and mid-
dlingly dystopian. Scratch
that, it sounds like the
last album I wrote about
fucked Blade Runner and
had a vaporwave album
for a love-child.
Swelling synths,
reluctantly descending
arpeggios, that whooshing
sound every door in every
sci-fi TV show makes
when the disposable
guy in the red shirt goes
through – what’s not to
love? If rainy cyberpunk
near-future LA is your
aesthetic and you need a
peaceful soundtrack for
the thousand-yard-stare
out your window every
night, notes clutched and
crumpled, tears rolling,
you’ll love this album.
I’m out of space. Cop
some jazz and funk too,
ok?
- HE
I know one thing for
certain, Anderson .Paak
is a wavy dude. Anderson
.Paak can rap with the
best in hip-hop, has a
unique voice that seems
well-suited to R&B and
the music he releases has
shades of neo-soul and
funk. He is the quintes-
sential alternative artist
and, in Knxwledge, he
has managed to find the
perfect musical partner to
complement his artistry.
This album is packed
with chilled, summer
time vibes that will get
you through revision by
“Beat Tape 2
is a smooth,
chilled offering
highlighting
Misch’s talent”
