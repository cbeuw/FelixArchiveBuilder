Professor Gast's £44,000 expenses bill included over
£26,000 on trips to America
(Communications and
Public Affairs); and
Professor David Gann,
Vice-President (Inno-
vation) – claimed over
£18,000 between them,
with a significant propor-
tion spent on visits abroad.
A spokesperson for
Imperial College London
told Felix it was “vital that
senior staff can build and
strengthen relationships
with industry, academic
partners, government,
philanthropists, and
alumni.”
They went on to say:
“All senior staff play a
role, but President Gast
has a particular respon-
sibility for safeguarding
the College's financial
future and maintaining
academic excellence and
is expected to give greater
emphasis to Imperial’s
external relationships, de-
velopment and fundrais-
ing. She regularly travels
abroad to raise Imperial's
international profile, forge
new partnerships, and
host meetings with key
figures, including alumni
and philanthropists.”
claims for 2016/17. Pro-
fessor Sir Keith Burnett,
of the University of Shef-
field, claimed for a single
taxi journey last year,
which cost £27.
A report from the
University and College
Union (UCU), published
earlier this year, found the
average vice-chancellor
across the entire higher
education sector was
spending £7,295 each
year on flights, and £3,498
on hotels. A significant
portion of vice-chancel-
lors flew exclusively in
first and business class.
V i c e - c h a n c e l l o r
expenses hit the news
earlier this year, when an
investigation by Channel
4’s Dispatches pro-
gramme found university
senior management had
claimed nearly £8 million
expenses over the past
two years. A number of
vice-chancellors came
under fire for their spend-
ing, which included fine
dining, Fortnum & Mason
hampers, and travel for a
pet dog.
In response to the
claims: some Russell
Group institutions, such
as the University of
York, publish all their
vice-chancellor’s expense
claims on an annual basis;
others, such as Imperial,
do not make this informa-
tion publicly available.
An Imperial spokes-
person told Felix: “All
expenses are claimed in
line with the College’s
policy to reimburse staff
for valid expenses in
the performance of their
duties for the College.”

Vice-chancellors within the Russell
Group had a wide range of expenses
for the year 2016/17. Professor Alice
Gast, President of Imperial College
London, had one of the highest bills
in the Russell Group, mainly for
international travel
course of 2016/17. Other
high spenders, aside
from Professors Gast and
Lamberts, included Pro-
fessor Stuart Corbridge
of Durham University,
and Professor Dame
Janet Beer of the Univer-
sity of Liverpool. They
claimed £18,711.61 and
£16,763.59 respectively.
Other vice-chancellors
had much smaller expense
claims: the vice-chancel-
lors of the University of
Exeter and Queen Mary
University of London did
not submit any expense
findings, Robert Halfon
MP, chairman of the
Commons Education
Select Committee, com-
pared the situation to the
MP expenses scandal
of 2009. He called on
universities to publish in-
formation on the expenses
of senior management,
saying “We live in an
age of transparency…We
have a duty to the taxpay-
er, we have a duty to the
student.”
Different universities
have different approaches
to publishing expense

The end of days…
F
or many of the
team this year,
the Felix Office
has become a sort
of refuge – a place they
can come to chill out,
or to work; where they
have unlimited tea and
coffee; and – recently –
where people have been
sleeping after pulling
an all-nighter to revise.
This week, it’s become
a refuge from something
else: the weather. While
it might be blisteringly
hot, unbearably muggy, or
skin-drenchingly wet out-
side, in the office we’ve
got the A/C on full blast,
and are luxuriating in its
cool puffs of air.
I know it’s a stereotypi-
cally British phenomenon
to talk only about the
weather, but have you
been outside this week? It
feels like wading through
a steam room, with close
hot air clinging to your
clothes, pressing down
on you. And if it’s not
tropically humid, the
air is being rent by great
flashes of lightning, as the
downpour of rain reaches
biblical proportions. It
feels uncomfortable and
strange, like there’s some
kind of impending apoca-
lypse waiting to sweep us
all away.
All this booming
thunder and sheets of rain
feels apropos, since we
are coming to a sort of
ending: for many of you,
exam season has either
already finished, or is
beginning to wind down;
many of our editorial
team have been counting
down the days until their
last exam desperately,
anxiously awaiting the
time when they can stop
spending all their time at
Central Library, and are
instead free to spend all
their time at the Union
downing pints. And yes,
I know some of you still
haven’t even exams yet,
but we’ve all got our cross
to bear.
At Felix, we’ve only got
two more issues left after
this one – the culmination
of a year of producing
papers that have covered
all the latest developments
on campus, from the UCU
strikes through to sexual
misconduct scandals. And
along the way there’ve
been plenty of centre-
folds, Hangman articles,
and puzzle sections to
keep you entertained.
We’re still using the
layout templates from our
first issue, meaning every
week we need to change
the date from September
to today – every time I
do so, we’ve moved a bit
further away from when
we started, and a bit closer
to the end of the year. It
feels bittersweet.
This year has gone by
incredibly quickly, but
when I look back at when
we first started, what I am
amazed by is how little I
knew our editorial team.
So many of our section
and copy editors are new
this year, and before Sep-
tember I didn’t even know
most of their names. How
things have changed: this
year the editorial team
have been like a family,
and I will genuinely miss
seeing their faces every
single week when I return
to my studies next year.
And, on that note, I
want to offer an invitation
to all of you: you are
welcome to get involved
in producing Felix. It’s a
student paper, produced
for students, and created
by students. It’s your voice
we want to represent, but
we can’t do that without
your involvement. We’re
a friendly, welcoming
bunch – there may even be
some cake for you in the
office – so, if you’ve got
any questions about how
you can help, or want to
join the most wholesome
society in Imperial, you
know where to go.
