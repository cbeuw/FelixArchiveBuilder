Tacita Dean’s LANDSCAPES: Self exploration, fate,
nostalgia, and lots of thinking
L
ANDSCAPES is
the 3rd
of Tacita
Dean’s series of
exhibitions, with
PORTRAIT and STILL
LIFE being displayed in
other galleries in London,
broadcasting the artist’s
wide range of talents.
By reminding the viewer
that the places you go are
often linked to something
personal, LANDSCAPES
creates an incredible
vision of reminiscence,
curiosity, and emotion.
Grand pieces are
present, like ‘The
Montafon Letter’, depict-
ing the Austrian Valley
mountains in a mix of
pitch black backgrounds,
sharp edges, and soft
white and grey strokes;
Dean uses the events
of its 1689 avalanches
to provide the viewer
with an understanding of
chance, the malleability
of the future, and a sense
of powerlessness against
it all. Her slate drawings,
however, are far more
abstract, with titles
floating in each piece
helping the viewer anchor
their interpretations to
what would otherwise
be simple clouds. She
does this with surprising
efficacy.
Dean also creates space
for the softer feeling
of nostalgia, with her
collections of ‘Round
Stone’ and ‘Four, Five,
Six, Seven and Nine leaf
Clover’, which I feel
grounded the exhibition.
The care she put into
collecting, preserving,
and organising these
otherwise meaningless
objects from childhood
could be keenly felt. It
conjured up the feeling of
being young and building
your world around small
found things. This curi-
osity and attention to the
world around us can get
lost in adulthood. Dean’s
curation brought a bit
of that childlike wonder
back: it was almost
humbling to see.
Dean then juxtaposes
these curations with my
favourite piece of the
exhibition: the strong
‘Quarantania (Mount
of Temptation)’. This
striking collage represents
a scene from the Christian
bible, in which Jesus
encounters the Devil in
the Judean Desert, and
is tempted by him. Dean
uses rich colour to depict
the scene, making it stand
out from the rest of her
largely-monochrome
exhibition. The piece
is dynamic, angry, and
painful, somehow portray-
ing how Christ must have
felt without description or
explicit story telling.
The connection of
memories and emotion
to landscapes and the
world culminates in her
final piece, a hour-long
film entitled ‘Antigone’.
Antigone, incidentally
also the name of Dean’s
sister, was both the
daughter and sister of
Oedipus. She was a
strong woman, standing
for justice, but, as with
most Greek myths, was
caught in her family’s
tragedy and destined to
die. Dean fills out her
story using the film. We
know of Oedipus’s story,
which culminates in him
blinding himself after he
learns of his atrocities;
from here, Dean follows
Oedipus in his journey
leading to Antigone, and
her part in delivering him
to the gods.
For Dean this film was
20 years in the making,
and stemmed from her
experiences in Utah at
a screenwriter’s retreat.
Conversations with fellow
writers and the poet and
classicist Anne Carson,
whose poems form part
of the script, shape this
film; it is an exploration
of her relationship with
her sister, along with a
meditation on how fate
interacts with the world
– which could be defined
as landscape – to take you
to your destination. The
ideas of fate, emotion, and
of self-reflection from the
other pieces in this exhi-
bition are repeated like
a mantra here. Different
videos are played side by
side, making it impossible
to focus on either. This
immerses the viewer in
sound and light, creating
a canvas on which the
viewer can project their
feelings as Oedipus
delivers a monologue, but
can also become confus-
ing and distracting.
This exhibition shows
Dean’s range in the media
sheusestoconveyhowthe
world we live in can affect
us, as well as how we can
use it to affect our own
personal journey. There
is often no clear narrative
in Dean’s pieces, and
many pieces are abstract
– Dean simply invites us
to reminisce and explore,
without promising a tidy
explanation. No two
visitors will come away
having experienced the
same thing.
The third of Tacita Dean’s London shows highlights the artist’s wide range of talents.
