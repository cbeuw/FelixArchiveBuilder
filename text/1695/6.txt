he unknown. It is
a concept almost
every individual
fears in one form
or another; one that many
question, but few have the
ability to really explore.
On May 16th
, the Science
Museum had the privilege
of unveiling a full-size
structural thermal model
of BepiColombo, the
first European spacecraft
to venture to Mercury,
the planet closest to the
sun. BepiColombo was
developed thanks to the
combined efforts of the
European Space Agency
(ESA) and the Japan
Aerospace Exploration
Agency (JAXA), and is
following in the footsteps
of NASA’s Mariner-10
and MESSENGER
(MErcury Surface,
Space ENvironment,
GEochemistry, and
Ranging).
Mercury itself is,
unsurprisingly, the
least-investigated of our
solar system’s rocky
planets, being only 36
million miles away from
the sun – over four times
close than the Earth is to
our star! Furthermore,
temperatures on Mercury
are often in the excess
of 350 degrees Celcius,
fluctuating from as high
as 430 degrees Celcius on
the sun side, to as low as
-180 degrees Celcius on
the night side. The surface
of the planet is marked
with signs of the harsh
space environment it is
subject to, with craters
across its surface indi-
cating previous tectonic
and volcanic activity.
Additionally, due to the
small obliquity – the tilt
of the planet on its axis
– there is an absence of
the traditional Earth-like
seasons, replaced with
the presence of thermal
seasons governed by the
distance of the planet from
the sun itself. Technology
has been built from scratch
to help the spacecraft cope
with this extreme climate,
and reach Mercury safely.
“The project
started in
2000; 18 years
later, 12,000
individuals
from 16
countries
have made
BepiColombo a
reality”
“As much as
60% of the
technology
on the
spacecraft has
been newly-
developed for
the mission”
The drive to travel to
Mercury started in 2000;
18 years later, 12,000
individuals, including
engineers and scientists
from 16 countries, have
helped materialise this
intersection between
science and technology, to
produce this six-meter-tall
spacecraft, which will
travel 48 million miles
over the course of just over
seven years. Travelling to
Mercury will require more
energy than travelling to
Pluto – which is 70 times
the distance from Earth!
BepiColombo will be
launched from Europe’s
Spaceport in Kourou,
French Guiana in October
later this year, and will
arrive in Mercury’s orbit
at the end of 2025.
Speaking to Felix,
Abigail Mackinnon,
Assistant Curator at the
Science Museum, said:
“this exhibition is an
incredible opportunity
to get the public excited
about a mission that has
not yet begun. Usually, in
space galleries you talk
about things that have
already happened, but to
have an area dedicated to
what is about to happen
is exciting! People will
already know of Bepi
before the launch, as they
have been to the museum
and seen the structural
thermal model, the scale
of it, and all the engineer-
ing… many people will be
awaiting its launch!”
told Felix: “The engi-
neering of BepiColombo
is extremely important
as the spacecraft cannot
reach Mercury and
collect data if it does not
survive! Therefore, the
engineering to overcome
this harsh environment
is key, with as much as
60% of the technology
on the spacecraft being
newly developed – it is an
engineer’s dream to work
on this project.”
Van Casteren said the
international cooperation
needed for the project had
been complex: “Working
together with Japan, this is
the first time this has been
done on this scale. The
benefits of international

collaboration are huge, as
the cost for development
is in the excess of €1.4
billion, which no country
could fund by themselves.
The financial aspects
require international
cooperation, but scientific
questions are the same all
over.”
The model itself has
been subject to the same
environment the space-
craft will experience on
Mercury in the future. If
you’re interested in seeing
the model, you can visit
the Tomorrow’s World
Gallery in the Science
Museum to get a closer
look!

emember back
to the days of
your childhood
when you
would go on long drives
to see family, or to visit
the coast on a warm bank
holiday. Like me, you
may have been obser-
vant enough to recognise
that car windscreens are
devilishly good at catch-
ing insects. Fortunately,
this was picked up by
the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds
in 2004 when they asked
motorists to take part
in the Big Bug Count,
counting how many
squashed insects had ac-
cumulated on the number
plates of cars. Now, back
to the present day: how
many times have you
noticed an abundance of
unfortunate dead insects
stuck to the outside of the
car after a long journey?
The likelihood is it has
been some time. Before
our very eyes, insects
such as bees and butter-
flies have slowly been
disappearing, but more
drastic declines in other
insect groups have only
just been documented.
A recent study found
that the abundance of
flying insects in Germany
had plunged by 75% over
the course of the past 25
years. I am sure many of
you will find this statistic
shocking, just as I did
when I first read it online.
Insects are an integral part
of ecosystems, with some
of their most important
roles being pollinators and
prey for other wildlife.
These new data were
gathered in nature reserves
across Germany, but
have implications for all
landscapes dominated by
agriculture, such as here
in the UK. The causes of
decline are not yet clear,
although factors such as
the destruction of habitat
and the widespread use of
pesticides are likely – as is
the climate. For those of
you aware of the impacts
of DDT in the ‘60s and
‘70s, it seems that we
have created a second
Silent Spring with our
overuse of neonicotinoid
pesticides.
To reverse this trend,
we of course need a
drastic change in farming
practises, and to replant
wild flower meadows –
otherwise the world as we
know it may change for
the worse, as ecosystems
start to collapse from
the bottom up. Without
pollinators such as bees,
our very existence could
be at risk as approxi-
mately one-third of the
world’s agricultural crops
depend upon pollination
provided by insects and
other animals. Insects
are providing us with an
ecosystem service for
free, and the least we can
do is to help provide them
with the habitat and tools
they need to do so. Yes,
some may be vectors of
disease and cause damage
to crops, but they are
vital for life as we know
it. As Sir David Atten-
borough once said: “If
all back-boned animals
disappeared overnight
then the insects wouldn’t
bat an eye, but if they
disappeared then we
would certainly notice”.

Stressed Mother, Stressed Child?
B
efore any of
us were born,
the only way
we could get
information from outside
was via the senses of
our mother. In terms of
evolution, it would be
greatly beneficial if we
could respond to the
external stimulation our
mother’s sensed, since
it would increase our
chances of survival. This
process of responding to
change is called foetal
programming.
Foetal, or prenatal,
programming comes in
various forms, from be-
havioural to physiological
modifications – and these
changes can last until
adulthood. A famous
example comes from a
dark part of human history
– the Dutch Hunger
Winter.
In World War II, the
Netherlands was occupied
by Germany. During that
period, the Nazis had cut
off the food supply to a
part of the Netherlands,
resulting in the population
starving for seven months.
This tragedy, however,
provided a window for
scientists to look at the
effects of famine on
human health, especially
on unborn babies.
By following up the
families of the victims,
scientists found children
of the women who were
pregnant during the time
of famine were born
smaller than their peers.
Moreover, children were
also smaller on average
when growing up. This
effect was also seen to be
passed down to the next
generation, where the
children of this population
were also smaller in size.
Such potent effects can
also exhibit themselves
in other forms. In a
ten-year study, a higher

correlate with a reduced
birth size in snowshoe
hares, with the offspring
of the hare more likely to
exhibit predator-avoidant
behaviours. This could be
explained by the increase
in predation risk, leading
to an increase in stress
level, causing the changes
observed!
In a recent study
published by Dr. Zaneta
Thayer and others, a
similar trend can be
observed across 14 differ-
ent vertebrate species. In
their meta-analysis of 114
results, they demonstrated
the effects of prenatal
exposure of maternal
stressonthefunctionofthe
Hypothalamic Pituitary
Adrenal (HPA)-axis. The
HPA-axis is the system
our body uses to respond
to stress, increasing our
chances of survival. When
exposed to a stressor, for
example exam stress or
the stress of predation, the
HPA-axis causes stress
hormones to be released,
in turn affecting the body
size or maturation rate of
the foetus.
As 14 different species
were studied, the scientists
adjustedforthebrain:body
size and maturation rate
of these animals. Their
result revealed that
the offspring that were
exposed to higher prenatal
stress level had a higher
stress hormone level at
birth. Amazingly, this is
observed across species.
This finding is significant
as it suggested that this
reaction to maternal stress
is ancient and conserved,
taking us a step forward
in understanding the
evolutionary origin of this
response.
What we experience in the womb can have a huge impact on how we develop in life, from stress to hunger.
