A$AP Rocky is TESTING out some new material
T
he Harlem-born
rapper and re-
cord-producer,
Rakim Mayers,
better known as A$AP
Rocky, released his aptly
titled TESTING last week,
much to my surprise and
delight. I say ‘aptly titled’
as this is easily his most
experimental and ‘out-
there’ record to date; an
intriguing flirtation with
the avant-garde unlike
what we have seen from
A$AP Rocky before.
The album is littered
with glitchy bass-lines,
eccentric beats, and
detuned lead melodies.
There are more than a
few stellar performances
from featured artists
on this record. I might
even go so far as to say
that they steal the show
a little bit. FKA Twigs’
verse on ‘Fukk Sleep’ is
especially memorable
and phenomenal, making
that track the best on the
album. Skepta nails the
hook on ‘Praise The Lord
(Da Shine)’, and Frank
Ocean gives a heartfelt
and subdued performance
on the closing track,
‘Purity’. The single that
was released ahead of the
album, ‘A$AP Forever’,
sounded promising and
contained an unexpected
feature from none other
than the one-and-only:
Moby. That song also had
features from T.I. and Kid
Cudi.
Even though his guests
steal the show, this does
not mean that A$AP
Rocky is unable to hold his
own. The opening track,
‘Distorted Records’, a
noisy and abrasive banger,
sees Rocky leading the
charge and raising the
roof. Definitely a standout
on the record, even if it
is in large part due to its
uniqueness, as it is the
only real banger on the
album.
And this is the biggest
gripe I have with the
album: it feels terribly
lopsided. The first half
has most of the ‘up-
tempo’ songs, while the
second half loses itself
in a seemingly endless
swamp of down-tempo
trap beats, wobbly guitars,
and spaced out vocals.
There are songs in which
this formula works, of
course, the aforemen-
tioned ‘Purity’ being one
example and ‘Hun43rd’
being another. But after
the third or fourth track the
same-old tricks get very
old indeed. The absolute
low-point for the album
happens about halfway:
the track ‘OG Beeper’
sounds like a first draft
demo on the bonus edition
of a B-sides record. Yes, it
is that bad.
However bleak a
picture I might have
painted for you in the
last couple of paragraphs,
I did in fact enjoy this
record a lot. I have to
laud A$AP Rocky for his
willingness to experiment
and for the strength of the
songwriting in the singles.
Songs such as ‘Distorted
Records’ and ‘Fukk
Sleep’ have already ended
up on my playlist. It is un-
fortunate that the record
in its entirety is spoiled by
some lazy filler material
and a badly structured
track-list.
