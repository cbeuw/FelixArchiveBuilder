Imperial dodgeball: Championship teams battle it out
in the final tournament of the year
Two Wolverine teams head up north to Burton-on-Trent for the final tournament of the year. Battling through
hardship they play well, and at the end of the day say goodbye to members who will be graduating.

L
ast Sunday,
I m p e r i a l
W o l v e r i n e s
ventured one
last time out of the com-
forts of London into the
wilderness of the north
for the final university
dodgeball fixture of
the year: the University
Championship. Teams
from far and wide
dropped their revision
books and grabbed their
balls to take part at the
event at St George’s
Park, Burton-on-Trent.
Imperial assembled two
teams of battle-hardened
Wolverines who were
willing to sacrifice their
body, soul, and a good
night’s sleep for victory.
The assembly point for
our warriors before their
trek north was outside Beit
Hall at 6am; however, it
seemed one of our freshers
who actually lives in Beit
Hall found the trip down-
stairs most challenging.
Sleeping through an alarm
clock could be a forgiv-
able offence, if it wasn’t
already the umpteenth
time it has happened this
year alone.
Both teams found
themselves in competitive
groups where it was all to
play for. We arrived at the
venue at 9.51am, with the
1s due to play their first
game against Birming-
ham 2s at 10.00am. The
odds were unfortunately
stacked against our brave
heroes: Leo Haigh had a
groin injury from the day
before, the courts were dif-
ferent to what we usually
play on, three players were
recovering from question-
able minibus driving from
Lochlann Allison forcing
some out of their seats,
useless line referees and
the ghastly mental image
of the main ref in short
shorts, which left nought
to the imagination and
would put even the best
professional athletes off
their game. The game
ended in a 3-11 loss. The
lack of a warmup proved
costly as nervous errors
and miscommunication
blighted our play style.
We failed on so many
of the basics and looked
far from the divisional
league winning team we
had been two months
ago: highlights included
not making a catch in the
entire game, foot faults
on lines, and failure to
capitalise on four ball
situations.
The next game against
Lincoln started much the
same as we struggled
to find our mojo. Three
fantastic catches in a
single game by our Club
Captain George Fish
before the half changed
the momentum of the
match and gave us the
foothold to get into our
groove before going on
to control and dominate
with a final score 12-4.
The next game was a
local derby against UEA,
a rival in our divisional
league. The first half was
dominated by us, thanks to
our initial ball advantage
earned by Captain Filip
Sebest, which ended 6-2
in our favour, only losing
a silly 30 second set just
before the half. However,
the handicap of having
the same useless line refs
as our first game would
strike again. A questiona-
ble catch followed by the
failure to acknowledge
an obvious hit would
prove pivotal in the
match. To highlight their
incompetence: one of the
referees blatantly said the
questionable catch wasn’t
a catch and another, when
asked if he were a referee,
said ‘no, I’m just standing
here.’ The game ended a
draw 7-7 and regardless
of our wingers’ – Nithin
Thoppuram and Nifemi
Adejumobi – fantastic
play, as well as George’s
‘tactical’ floor crawling
against Lancaster in the
final game ending 12-4,
the fate of the first game
consigned us to third
place in our group.
Wolverines 2s had a
particularly challenging
group. The first half ended
a miserable 1-7, although
pin point single throwing
from James Rice-Mellor
narrowed the margins in
the second half. In the
final set, Yan Jin Ho found
herself alone on the court.
However, a lionhearted
catch proved not enough
to win the set and we lost
7-9 in the end. Coventry
were arguably the easiest
side our 2s were going
to meet this day as the
remaining teams – Win-
chester 1s, Birmingham
3s and Hertfordshire As,
– are all top flight teams.
Winchester lived
up to their nickname
‘Wincheating’ with an
exceptional display of
poor sportsmanship and
dishonesty as expected.
Our brave Wolverines did
manage to win a game
after a pivotal catch from
retiring Wolverine Ciaran
Coneelly and draw a
game after James hit out
two England nationals
but ultimately lost 3-17.
It was much the same in
the third game against
Birmingham 3s, however
the scoreline wasn’t the
true tale of the match. The
2s Captain Philip Zeeuw
valiantly lead from the
front but unfortunately
found his team being
eventually overcame in
each game, losing 2-12.
The final game of the
day was another local
derby against a divisional
rival, Hertfordshire As.
Knowing our play style
well, they focussed early
on hitting out our strong
arm throwers on the wings
usually leaving Yan Jin or
Lalita Radtanajiravong
to the end. These two
phenomenal catchers
unfortunately struggled to
fish a catch from multiple
ball attacks and the game
finished in a 0 – 20 loss.
Although a disappoint-
ing day for all concerned,
Aagu Kangatharan’s har-
monica playing soothed
andconsoledoursaddened
hearts. The club’s
spirit proved unaltered,
however, on the minibus
ride home as we had a
celebratory KFC meal and
performed a Katy Perry
tribute rendition much to
the displeasure of other
motorists.
The club sadly has
to say goodbye to a few
retiring members. Club
Captain George Fish,
1st
Team Captain Filip
Sebest, Steve Ndumbe
and Ciaran Coneelly; we
wish you all the best in
the future. Throw together
Wolverines, dodge alone.
