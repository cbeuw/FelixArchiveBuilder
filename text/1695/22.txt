BUSINESS SCHOOL
STUDENTS
LAUNCH STUDENT
INVESTMENT FUND
Earlier this year, the
Imperial College Business
School officially launched
the Student Investment
Fund – a student-led fund,
responsible for managing
£100,000 in assets, open
to students of the Business
School with an interest in
developing their skills in
investing. We sat down
with the Fund’s Executive
Committee to talk about
how it all came about:
How did the Fund
come about? Was it
a student-led initia-
tive?
The Fund came about
when several students on
the MSc Investment &
Wealth Management and
MSc Finance & Account-
ing programmes identi-
fied the need for a forum
in which students could
practically apply what
they were learning in the
classroom. It was wholly
student-run, but has been
strongly supported by
both the Business School
and the central College.
What were some of
the challenges faced
in establishing the
Fund?
There were a number of
key challenges we faced
in setting it up. Raising
the funds took consid-
erable time and effort,
with multiple pitches and
proposals to convince
the Endowment Board
to give us £100,000. The
Business School were
keen to ensure the project
would be an ongoing
complement to their
curriculum, and would
allow students to put their
Imperial-learned skills
into practice. As such,
we spent a lot of our
time designing the Fund
as an ongoing part of the
Business School’s – and
hopefully, later, the Col-
lege’s – offering.
In order to get students
interested, as well as

attracting further funding
from external sources,
we needed to establish
the Fund as a credible
initiative that would
increase student employ-
ability, their practical
skills, and their exposure
to the buy-side industry.
The Executive Team met
with countless industry
professionals to build
our network, with some
of these professionals
running training sessions
in the future: for example,
we had one last month run
by Ryan Shea, Head of
Research at Amareos, on
bridging the gap between
classroom learning and
best practice in the asset
management world.
How is this Fund dif-
ferent to other fi-
nance societies at Im-
perial?
Our Fund is different,
because it combines both
fundamental and quantita-
tive investment strategies.
As far as we are aware, we
are the only student-led
investment fund that runs
quantitative investment
strategies. We’re also part-
nering with key industry
firms, such as Fidelity, to
form specialised training
programmes for our
analysts. In addition, we
are working with a start-
up, QIARK, which allows
us to make democratic
investment decisions
between a theoretically
infinite group of analysts.
This could, in theory,
allow us to open up the
Fund to the entire College
in the future.
How exactly does the
Fund work?
The Fund is run by an
Executive Team of six
MSc Investment & Wealth
Management students,
an MSc Finance &
Accounting student, and
an MSc Strategic Mar-
keting student. It is also
overseen by an Invest-
ment Committee from the
Business School, which
ensures we’re complying
with previously-agreed
requirements and risk
controls. We also have an
Advisory Board, which
is made up of several
industry professionals,
from companies like JP
Morgan Asset Manage-
ment, Aviva Investors,
and Tikehau Capital. The
Advisory Board guides
us, offering expert advice
as we make our trades.
Having the support of key
management personnel
who are currently working
in industry has been inval-
uable in fine-tuning our
investment strategies.
We run two types of
strategies: a discretionary
strategy, based on funda-
mental analysis, and quan-
titative strategies, based
on algorithms. The invest-
ment is divided between
these two in a 30:70 ratio.
We want to showcase
Imperial’s unique value
proposition – that of a
technologically-innova-
tive university – in the
type of investing we do.
As such, our quantitative
strategies are allocated a
larger proportion of the
available funding. Any
profits from the fund are
reinvested for future use.
Who can get involved
with the Fund?
At the moment, any
Business School students
with an interest in invest-
ing, or who want to learn
more, can apply. Students
can apply to either be
an equity analyst or a
member. Equity analysts
produce tear sheets, which
they use to present their
ideas for new investments
at our frequent stock
pitches. If approved,
the tear sheet forms the
basis for a proper equity
research report. The ones
that are approved by
the Executive Team are
implemented within the
portfolio.
Membership alone
requires no formal time
commitment – students
may just enjoy coming
along to the stock pitches,
events, or hearing from
our partners and speakers.
The Fund is also designed
to be a networking tool
for those interested in
becoming analysts in
the buy-side industry,
hence our use of industry
networks to deliver
training programmes.
The students we are
looking for have a real
passion for research and
investment management,
a systematic and method-
ical way of thinking, and
an analytical mind-set.
They should also really
enjoy in-depth company
analysis. While we’re
only open to Business
School students currently,
we hope to open the Fund
up to the wider student
body as soon as possible.

the Fund, please email
