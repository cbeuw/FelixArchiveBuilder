The Breadwinner fails to win our heart
The animation, set in Taliban-controlled Kabul, has good intentions, but a weak script and lack of direction.
T
he Breadwinner,
Nora Twomey’s
follow-up to her
breakout film
The Secret of Kells, opens
with a scene we are to
take as paradigmatic of
life in Afghanistan at the
turn of the 21st
century:
a one-legged man, who
fought in the Soviet-
Afghan war, hawks a red
dress his daughter has
never had the chance to
wear. The girl, Parvana,
shoos away a dog sniffing
at their wares, and attracts
the attention of a hostile
young member of the
Taliban, who threatens to
demand her hand in mar-
riage. Later that evening,
the Taliban member has
her father, Nurullah,
arrested, and carted off
to prison. With the main
male family member
gone, there is nobody
to support Parvana, her
sister Soraya, her mother
Fattema, or baby brother
Zaki. Women cannot leave
the house alone without
facing a whipping. And,
so, Parvana dresses up as
a boy, setting out to help
her family.
Interspersed with the
action is an ongoing tale
Parvana tells, both to
herself and those around
her, in which a young boy
saves his village, whose
seeds have been stolen
by an evil Elephant King
living atop a mountain.
The animation in these
sections is beautifully
distinct, with the al-
ready-stylised visuals
of the film undergoing a
further refinement, until
characters resemble flat
puppets moving against a
flat screen.
The flatness of the ani-
mation style is something
of a refreshing corrective,
in an industry dominated
by 3D animation – no
2D film has ever won
the Academy Award for
Best Animated Feature.
Twomey is adept at
building characters out
of collections of simple
lines and shapes, creating
a panoply of body types
and movements that never
feel anything less than
genuine.
The style, however,
remains the best thing
about the film, which is
otherwise, unfortunately,
held back by a stilted
script and poor develop-
ment. We’ve barely met
Nurullah for five minutes
before he is carted off
to prison, making it
difficult to connect with
his character. Similarly,
ideas within the film tend
to be introduced and then
forgotten about, or never
really introduced at all.
The topic of the death
of Parvana’s brother,
Sulayman, for example,
is referred to in passing
multiple times early on in
the film, but, by the end, is
supposed to function as a
major plot point. The tale
told by Parvana, similarly,
seems to serve very little
purpose other than to show
off a different animation
style; it doesn’t link to
the main story well, either
in theme or action, and
when it does there is the
sense it is being forced.
While it does begin to
touch on the idea of the
unreliable narrator, and
the ever-shifting nature of
storytelling, it stops too
short to be anything close
to mind-expanding.
The voice acting – all
done in English with a
Middle Eastern lilt – is
passable, although at
times it can be stilted.
This is most likely due
to the dialogue within the
screenplay, which never
feels truly naturalistic.
There are two films
that come to mind when
watching The Bread-
winner: firstly, Siddiq
Bamark’s 2003 production
Osama, which also tells
the story of a young girl
who dresses up as a boy
to help her family survive
in Taliban-controlled
Kabul. Osama, which is
live-action, manages to do
a much better job at com-
municating the danger
inherent in the practice,
and the blisteringly
oppressive nature of the
regime. While The Bread-
winner does make much
of the societal restrictions
placed on women and
girls – as well as the harsh
punishments meted out –
it never really instills the
same sense of tension. We
always feel Parvana will
make it home at the end of
the day.
The second film it made
me think of was Marjane
Satrapi’s brilliant 2007
animation Persepolis,
based on her experiences
growing up in post-rev-
olutionary Iran. While
Persepolis and The Bread-
winner are roughly the
same length, the former
manages to pack far more
into its runtime, engaging
with numerous serious
themes in short vignettes,
treating them with the
respect they deserve. The
Breadwinner, on the other
hand, rarely explores
topics beyond the broadest
outlines – that the Taliban
regime was hostile and op-
pressive. There are certain
points of the film that cry
out for more exposition
– Parvana’s friendship
with Shauzia, another girl
dressing as a boy, which
seems to teeter on the edge
of romance; or the way
cycles of power and abuse
can replicate themselves.
As a boy, Parvana is able
to repeatedly disobey the
orders of her sister and
mother, leaving the house
knowing they can neither
stop her nor follow. It
would have been inter-
esting to see these ideas
explored further.
The historical context
of the film is also flattened
into a mere backdrop. Par-
vana’s father, at the begin-
ning, explains to her that
Afghanistan has always
been fought over by
others, making the Taliban
seem like one more in
a long line of nameless,
faceless oppressors, rather
than something with a
specific cultural and his-
torical context. Swathes
of history become mere
anecdote, and referenc-
es to previous acts of
violence – Nurullah’s
missing leg; hidden land-
mines – that continue to
have repercussions. Jet
fighters occasionally race
across the sky, and the film
climaxes with the start
of the 2001 invasion of
Afghanistan, but present
it as just another act of
violence, rather than a sea
change. The result is a film
that, although obviously
a work of beauty and
passion and love, leaves
the viewer with little to
remember it by.
