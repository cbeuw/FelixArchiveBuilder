The audit shows
PG students still

A

a f t e r n o o n s
– which are supposed
to be reserved for free
time – has found that
they are widely used for
teaching.
The audit was carried
out by Nick Burstow,
Imperial College Union’s
Deputy President (Educa-
tion), and Luke McCrone,
President of the Graduate
Students’ Union, with
input from Central Time-
tabling and faculty staff. It

Union elections close, with some positions unfilled
opportunity to vote in
the third set of Union
elections this academic
year from noon, Tuesday
29th
May – a significantly
shorter voting timeframe
than the last set of elec-
tions, which saw voting
open for nearly an entire
week. As of the time of
writing, turnout is around
5.5%
In total, 113 roles are
up for election through
the Union’s website; the
majority of these roles are
Club, Society, or Project
(CSP) roles that were
unfilled during the last
election cycle. Students
will need to be a member
of that particular CSP
before they are able to
vote for the roles. Along-
side this, a number of
Constituent Union (CU),
Wellbeing Representation
Network (WBRN), and
Academic Representation
Network (ARN) roles also
have people running.
However, there are
several notable positions
that will be left unfilled
for the second election
cycle in a row: this
election marks the second
time no candidates have
put themselves forward
for the Union’s LGBT+
Officer, one of the eight
Liberation Officers, who
“works to stop any dis-
crimination against the
LGBT+ community at
Imperial”.
Alessio Incitti, the
current LGBT+ Officer,
told Felix: “Even though
this time the position was
promoted individually on
the Union’s social media,
and I was contacted by
some potential candidates,
sadly no-one ended up
running.”
He said the fact the
LGBT+ Officer was the
only position left unfilled
“means that there is a
problem with the en-
gagement of the LGBT+
community, and I hope it
won’t be ignored by next
year’s Officer Trustees.
Personally, I would en-
courage LGBT+ students
to take the leap and run
for leadership positions
like this one. It has been
one of the most rewarding
experiences during my
time at Imperial.”
A significant propor-
tion of candidates are
running uncontested: in
total, only around 40% of
the roles will be contested
between more than one
candidate, while nearly
one third of submitted
candidates failed to
provide a manifesto on
the voting website.
The last election cycle
took place in March,
and saw the election of a
number of high-ranking
roles, including sabbatical
officers.
sessions – representing a
total time of 594 hours –
being scheduled for MSc
and MRes students across
the entire year.
Under Imperial’s
Academic Timetabling
Policy, all Wednesday
afternoons are to be kept
free from noon for all
taught students for “sport
and society events and ac-
tivities of a non-compul-
sory nature,” providing a
work-life balance.
Burstow told Felix:
"Postgraduate taught
students should be able
to take part in the same
activities on Wednesday
afternoons as their under-
graduate counterparts",
further adding: "It is
unacceptable that some
courses continue to sched-
ule teaching for taught
postgraduates on Wednes-
day afternoons, despite
the academic timetabling
policy currently in place”
The audit looked at
timetabling within the
Faculty of Engineering,
Faculty of Natural
Sciences, and Institute
of Molecular Science &
Engineering. The Im-
perial College Business
School is exempt from the
timetabling policy.
McCrone said the
report, which followed on
from work completed last
year, was “hugely impor-
tant”. He told Felix: “We
want to ensure PGT stu-
dents have the space and
time each week to achieve
a balanced lifestyle during
their time at university, in-
cluding the development
of skills outside of their
taught programme.
The number of hours
and sessions varied
between faculties; the
Faculty of Engineering
took the lead with 124
teaching sessions sched-
uled for the year, against
110 for Natural Sciences
and five for the institute
of Molecular Science &
Engineering. Physics was
the department with the
highest number of teach-
ing sessions, 36, followed
by Civil Engineering with
33. Earth Science Engi-
neering has the most hours
per teaching session, with
an average of nearly five
hours, closely followed
by Civil Engineering
with over three hours per
teaching session.
One taught postgrad-
uate, who has not taken
part in any Wednesday
afternoon activities this
year told Felix: “I would
have liked to get involved
in societies, and if I was a
member of sports teams I
would have been annoyed
[by the scheduled teach-
ing]. My previous univer-
sity was much more social
– here postgraduates
seem to just be focussed
on work, work, and more
work.”
Keeping Wednesday
afternoons free has been
a long-running goal for
student representatives,
with the last two Deputy
Presidents (Education)
promising to hold College
to account on timetabling.
In 2016, a paper present-
ed by the then-Deputy
President (Education)
Luke McCrone found that
almost half of all Msc and
Mres students had been
affected by the infringe-
ment of the Academic
Timetabling Policy.
A College spokesper-
son said they were “very
grateful to Nick and Luke
for highlighting this”, and
the curriculum review
for postgraduate taught
programmes should help
“ease the pressure on time-
tables.” They told Felix:
“Extra-curricular activ-
ities are an integral part
of the student experience
at Imperial. Setting aside
Wednesday afternoons
for students to participate
in clubs and societies is
important to us, and we
are sorry that this hasn’t
been the case for taught
postgraduate students on
some courses.”

Imperial subjects fall in Guardian League Table, as
Cambridge retains top position

mperial College
London has dropped
one place in the
Guardian League
Tables, with a number
of individual subjects
dropping sharply in the
rankings.
Overall, Imperial was
ranked seventh in the
country, between Bath
(which placed 6th
) and
Warwick (which placed
8th
). Cambridge, Oxford,
and St Andrews took the
top three places for a third
year in a row. Imperial’s
ranking is one place down
from last year, when it
was ranked joint 6th
with
Loughborough university.
The rankings are gen-
erated from a number of
metrics, including student
satisfaction, student to
staff ratio, and employ-
ment after six months.
This year The Guardian
also looked at the propor-
tion of first year students
who progress to their
second year.
A number of individual
subjects also saw sig-
nificant changes in their
rankings. Chemistry saw
the biggest overall drop,
falling 19 places to 37th
in
the country, while mathe-
matics went from 3rd
place
to 21st
. Both subjects have
continuation rates below
average for Imperial as
a whole, with over 10%
of first year chemistry
students not making it to
the second year.
Physics, which last
year fell 22 places in the
Guardian rankings, fell
another two places to 32nd
.
While they had a contin-
uation rate in line with
the university as a whole,
they dropped their score
on student satisfaction
with course and teaching.
Physics students were the
least satisfied with their
course and feedback in the
country. Similar problems
were highlighted recently
in the Complete Univer-
sity Guide (CUG) league
tables.

Several departments
scored poorly on the
NSS response, including
physics and chemistry.
Speaking to Felix, a
College spokesperson
said: “Imperial College
London is committed to
offering all of its students
a world-leading, rigorous,
evidence-based, inclusive
educational experience as
part of a vibrant research
environment. The College
is embarking on a radical
transformation of the way
it educates by applying
new teaching methods
that enrich the student
experience and improve
inclusion and diversity.
We will be working with
students at every opportu-
nity to get feedback, as we
understand that we need
this evidence base if we
are to offer students the
very best in teaching and
support services.”
The Guardian’s league
tables have a different
methodology to other
league tables, choosing
to exclude scores for
research, since they are
“of limited relevance to
students.” This sets them
apart from other rankings,
such as the Times Higher
Education (THE) World
University Rankings, or
the CUG rankings, which
both include research
scores. Imperial was
ranked 8th
in the world in
THE’s rankings earlier
this academic year, while
Imperial was ranked 4th
in the UK in the CUG
rankings.
However, some have
expressed concern over
the dramatic nature of
some of the shifts within
the Guardian’s league
tables: City, University
of London, dropped 63
places from last year’s
tables, while Liverpool
John Moores rose 31
places, overtaking the
University of Liverpool, a
Russell Group institution.

“Chemistry

country, while
mathematics
went from 3rd

”
Other subjects saw
smaller drops, such as
materials and computer
science, which dropped
two places each. Mechan-
ical engineering was the
only subject to improve
their ranking year-on-
year, climbing four places
to take the top spot;
Imperial was also ranked
the highest for earth and
marine sciences, and civil
engineering.
Overall, Imperial
dropped their score slight-
ly on student satisfaction
with courses, teaching,
and feedback, which are
based on National Student
Survey (NSS) responses.
This year’s NSS results
showed a wide range in
student satisfaction, with

Times Higher Education World
Reputation Rankings see UK fall
This week also saw the release of the Times
Higher Education World Reputation Rankings,
which saw Imperial drop two places to 20th
globally. Imperial was one of four London
universities in the rankings to drop places,
with UCL coming in highest at 18th
.
Overall, the UK went down in the rankings
in comparison to last year, with one fewer
university in the table, and six of its nine
universities features dropping in the rankings.
The USA remained the most represented
country, with 44 universities in the top 100.
While Asian universities have been climbing
in the overall league tables, this success hasn’t
translated to prestige outside the continent.
The rankings are generated from the
Academic Reputation Survey, which is sent
out to scholars across the world. Institutions
are given a score for their research and
teaching reputations.
