The Fortnite phenomenon – Battle Royale

U
nless you’ve
been living
under a
rock, you’ve
most probably heard of
Fortnite. And what is it
exactly? It’s the game
that is currently trending
amongst YouTubers,
gamers, and angry ten
year olds alike. And it has
been for the past several
months; in fact it’s basical-
ly a cultural phenomenon
at this point. What exactly
about Fortnite makes it
so popular? And will the
trend last? Let’s discuss.
First some backstory;
Fortnite has been in de-
velopment for a while. In
fact it’s actually a zombie
survival horror game
that was announced all
the way back in 2011. In
mid 2017, a game called
PlayerUnknown’s Battle-
grounds was released and
rapidly became popular as
a multiplayer online battle
royale game. Seeing an
opportunity to capitalise
on the trend, Epic Games
created a battle royale
mode out of Fortnite
which was released as
Fornite Battle Royale. It’s
this spin-off version that
everyone is playing and
which is so popular.
play it from the get go.
It can always be a risk to
release a game for free,
especially when you’ve
put in so much time and
effort into developing
it. However, being free
means more people will
try it out, including the
people who would’ve
otherwise dismissed the
game and not played it
otherwise. So you have
this domino effect where
people play and enjoy
the game, rave about it
so other people hear, and
more and more people
play because of its acces-
sibility.
In addition to this,
Fortnite is multiplatform;
you can play it on a Play-
station, Xbox, PC, or even
a phone. While there’s no
android version yet, it’s in
development and due to
be released in the coming
months. Multiplatform,
again, means that a large
variety of people are able
to play it, and it’s been
designed in such a way
that you can play against
console players while
playing on the iPhone.
This makes it really feel
like one, big game that
everyone is playing and
helps make sure nobody
gets left out.
Obviously being a free
game can only go so far.
The biggest thing, at the
end of the day, is that the
game is just plain fun.
The vibrant colours and
aesthetics immediately
make it stand out from its
otherwise bleaker or more
drab FPS counterparts.
It also combines the
building features of Mine-
craft with a shooter game;
something which doesn’t
sound like it should
work but does. Is there
an enemy sniper gunning
you down? Just a build a
wall so they can’t get to
you. It makes for more
interesting and varied
play styles and strategies.
It’s an easy game for
anyone to get into, though
it would take quite a while
to really master.
The game also has
multiple updates, new
modes and timed events
that add a new twist
everytime you play. You’ll
on.) All in all, the game
appeals to your inner child
and is a shining example
of how to have fun and
not give a damn.
So is this the new game
of the century or is the
Fortnite trend only going
to last for a short while?
Probably the latter if
we’re being realistic about
it. Other games have been
trending before; their
popularity peaks before
tumbling back down.
Pokémon Go lasted a
month while Flappy Bird
was able to make do for
a week. Having said that,
the Fortnite craze is not
slowing down anytime
soon, thanks in no small
part to the recent mobile
release and the weekly
updates spicing things up.
Whether the hype dies
down in a few months or
years, there’s no denying
that the game has made
a lasting impact. Even if
fewer people play it, the
game will still be as fun,
and as outrageous, as
ever.
Fornite Battle Royale is the game that’s all the rage these days. But what exactly makes it so popular?

“All in all, the

The biggest thing going
for it is that it’s free, so
that already gives it an
edge over other multi-
player games like Star
Wars Battlefront or Call of
Duty.. Free-to-play means
anyone can download and

when you log onto the
game. Sometimes you can
throw boogie bombs to
make a group of enemies
dance non-stop. Other
times you can literally ride
a rocket. There’s always
some new and interesting
curveball that changes up
the game mechanic. This
means that everytime you
play will be memorable,
and there will always be
something you can share
online. Some crazy wild
