Felix Food taste test: instant ramen flavours
As exam season continues to crunch, a group of intrepid Felix writers gave their verdict on varieties of instant
ramen on offer across campus. They barely make it out alive.

T
here is, fairly or
unfairly, perhaps
no meal more
closely asso-
ciated with the student
experience than instant
ramen. Different univer-
sities may have their own
iconic foodstuffs, but the
ubiquity of instant noo-
dles seems to cut across
time and space. At the
most basic level, instant
noodles appeal to students
because they have the twin
virtues of being quick
and cheap, making them
handy in an environment
where neither time nor
money are particularly
forthcoming. They also
conform to a long-held
prejudice against students:
that we are too lazy, or too
stupid, or both, to cook for
ourselves.
While the exam period
is beginning to wind down
for some people, others
have yet to even start,
and, as the student loan
begins to fritter away,
Deliveroo is becoming a
less-viable option for late-
night library sessions. As
always, instant noodles
will have your back. In the
interest of bringing you all
the most relevant content,
an intrepid gang from the
Felix editorial team took it
upon themselves to taste-
test some of the many va-
rieties of ramen available
on campus. It was, in the
words of one participant,
“a stomach ache waiting
to happen”. Not all heroes
wear capes.
We head first to the
Union Shop, but the pots
on offer are too small,
and we feel we would
be left hungry. Little did
we know. Instead, we
head down to Essentials,
cutting across the shade of
Prince’s Lawn, and pick
out five varieties of ramen,
bringing them back to the
office for testing.
powders; dehydrated
peas that resemble little
pills; blobs of off-white
fat, solidified into glis-
tening clumps – are a
mystery, united only by
a presumed reliance on
MSG. A message, printed
on the side of some of
the packets, cheerfully
exhorts us to ‘share great
taste with your friends’,
as if a package of instant
noodlesforoneisanything
other than the loneliest
meal in the world.
PHO GA
This is the first type
we try, which is lucky,
since its flavour is quite
muted, and few of the
later varieties will leave
our taste buds fully
intact. Some would call
the flavour of the Pho Ga
delicate; others would say
it is non-existent; one par-
ticipant simply says “no”
when he tries it. The dish,
supposedly modelled after
the popular Thai food, has
nothing to it other than
texture; the flavour is
entirely bland. Pieces of
what we assume are meant
to be dehydrated chicken
bob around the pot, like
overgrown sea-monkeys;
I put a piece in my mouth,
and it squeaks against my
molars, like a piece of
fatty gristle.
All of the ramen come
with little plastic forks,
but the one included with
the Pho Ga is different
– with a thinner stem,
wider head, and three
prongs, it resembles more
of a trident than a fork,
allowing its wielder to
live out their Poseidon
fantasy. It’s an apt choice:
the flat noodles are akin
to some kind of deep sea
creature, perhaps a hive
of eels, or those long
worms that peek out near
volcanic vents. They
wriggle and flap, barely
able to stay on the fork
long enough to take a
bite. When we’re finally
able to get them to our
lips, they are completely
tasteless, wet and slimy,
and – despite the hot broth
– somewhat clammy. It’s
not an auspicious start to
our experiment.
Score: 3/10
ARTIFICIAL STEWED
PORK CUTLET FLA-
VOUR
On the surface, this
doesn’t appear promising;
the name alone is enough
to turn us off. If there is
any word that could make
the idea of ‘stewed pork
cutlet’ less appetising, ‘ar-
tificial’ is pretty high up
there. But after the boiling
water is poured in, this
ramen cup is what most
closely resembles the
instant noodles of child-
hood: curly thin noodles,
looping and swirling
around each other like
tangled yarn, floating in
an orangey-green liquid,
and flecked with shards
of green, which could be
dried herbs, but could also
just be pieces of plastic.
One participant has
already tapped out by this
point; eschewing tasting,
he instead sniffs each
cup, giving his olfactory
rating. To him, this one
smells like “the floor of a
Chinese restaurant”, but
the taste is surprisingly in-
offensive. There’s a strong
hit of generic stock, with
undertones of extreme
saltiness. It’s quite bland,
true, but that is probably
to be expected; as a
flavourful meal, the dish
is lackluster, but it serves
as a potent reminder, for
me, of the times when I
used to be allowed instant
noodles as ‘a treat’ at
home, so I’m sold, if only
on the nostalgia front.
“The pack says
‘share with
your friends!’,
as if instant
ramen weren’t
the loneliest
meal in the
world”
Within each round,
squat container there is
a tangled nest of dried
noodles, along with
various packets, whose
contents – beige, ash-like
“One
participant
says the ramen
smells‘like
the floor of
a Chinese
restaurant’”
After a discussion, the
initial rating we give this
pot is a four. However, had
we known what culinary
horrors lay ahead, I feel
we would have been a bit
kinder to our poor, boring
artificial stewed pork
cutlet, so I’m bumping it
up to a six.

SPICY HOT
During exam season,
the Felix Office has
become a regular study
space, and this variety
of ramen is a permanent
fixture, so we were quite
excited to dive in. Assem-
bling the ramen throws
up the first practical
challenge: it comes with a
packet of chilli oil that has
clumped together, chilli
flakes glued to each other
in small, flat compresses.
Getting them out and into
the pot is a struggle, and
only about two-thirds
make it out of the packet.
In retrospect, this was
still far too much. Once
the water has been added,
the noodles become com-
pletely invisible, hidden
by a thick layer of chilli
oil, a shade of luminous
caramine, pooling like
blood on the surface. It’s
the kind of substance that
stains your clothing, and
quite possible skin and
teeth. In the words of one
participant, the dish looks
like “my chance of getting
a first at this university.”
Still, we push on,
dredging up the noodles,
which are slick with a
layer of glistening oil.
The first mouthful burns.
It’s not the pleasant
burn you get from a
finger chili, not even the
over-sweetened kind you
have with sriracha sauce,
but something more
corrosive, like a chemical
burn. It tastes like the big
black and orange crosses
on chemical labels. It
tastes like the reasons labs
have fume cupboards. It
tastes like singed hair and
heavy industry and silent
springs. I don’t know if
we can go on.

BROAD NOODLE AR-
TIFICIAL BEEF FLA-
VOUR HOT POT
In all honestly, I barely
remember how this one
tasted. In my notes, I’ve
written that one partici-
pant described the smell
as “hot sweat”, but after
the Spicy Hot variety
I might as well have
blacked out, so little do I
remember about the ex-
perience. All I can recall
is being distracted by the
texture of the dish: broad,
flat noodles wriggle in
the broth like giant kelp
fronds. Despite leaving
the noodles ‘cooking’ far
beyond the recommended
time, the noodles still feel
underdone: they manage
to be gelatinous on the
outside, but still tough in
the middle. They are, on
the whole, seemingly-in-
destructible: our teeth
compress them, rather
than biting through them,
before they spring back
to their original shape
again. They’re difficult to
swallow, slapping against
the side of the throat,
creating a choking sen-
sation, like being water-
boarded from the inside
out.
detailing what it is like
to suffer from anosmia,
or the loss of the sense of
smell and taste. Although
it might be temporary
– most of us have expe-
rienced it to some degree
during a blocked nose or
head cold – in some cases
the damage will be perma-
nent. Sufferers describe a
world closed off to them:
food is like ash in the
mouth, a tasteless texture;
they are robbed of some
of the greatest joys in life,
whether that be the ability
to taste a fine wine, or the
smell of freshly-cut grass
in the summer.
Eating the hot and sour
ramen, I begin to feel
jealous of them. The dish
is a complete assault on
the senses, so much so I
would petition for its ex-
istence to be reclassified as
a crime against humanity.
Problems begin as soon
as the packet is opened:
a thin brown liquid is
poured over the noodles,
and a stench of unwashed
feet pervades the room,
catching in the back of the
throat. Decanting some of
the thin, slippery noodles
into a cup, I can feel the
gorge rising in my throat,
and I need to pause for a
while before I can bring
them to my lips. dirty socks soaked in lye;
like the sharp sting of a
chemical factory wafting
over a motorway on a
midsummer’s day; like
rotting fruit, macerating
into a sour liquor. How
anyone could enjoy it is
completely beyond us.

After testing the final
variety, none of us are
able to stomach any more.
We sit back at our desks,
returning to work as the
saltiness of the noodles
makes itself known,
dehydrating us into a
postprandial stupor, head-
aches thumping against
our temples. The pots
sit on the side, rapidly
cooling; the thin layers of
fat float on the top, before
beginning to congeal.
We eventually take them
out to the bins, the wet
noodles making a sick-
ening thwack against the
shiny black bags. Back in
the office, the smell of the
ramen pots – a strong note
of star anise, undercut by
something putrefying and
chemical – hangs in the
air, before it dissipates.
“The first
mouthful feels
corrosive –
something
like a chemical
burn. It tastes
like heavy
industry’”
With all this sensory
overload, the taste leaves
no impression on the
tongue; the ramen is bland
to the point of forgettable-
ness. Either that, or we’ve
already burnt our taste
buds in the previous chal-
lenge. Disappointment is
the word that comes to
mind. As one participant
says, “you know how
most food that ends up
covering your lips with
grease tastes delicious? I
feel I’ve been cheated.”

HOT AND SOUR
On occasion, in news-
papers or magazines,
you come across articles
“Eating the
hot and sour
ramen, I begin
to feel jealous
of those
who’ve lost
their sense
of smell and
taste’”
The noodles have the
same undertaste as the
hot and spicy variety – a
sinister chemical punch
– but the overwhelm-
ing top note is one of
vinegar, which absolutely
pummels all other tastes
into submission. In com-
parison with this two-di-
mensional barrage on
our taste buds, the other
ramen seem complex and
nuanced, like a Canaletto
painting, filled with pre-
viously-unseen details.
My great-grandmother
used to drink pickling
juice, and I feel even she
would balk at this ramen.
It tastes like a pail of
