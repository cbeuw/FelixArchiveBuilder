P
rofessor Alice
Gast, President
of Imperial
College London,
last year had one of the
largest expense claims
of any Russell Group
head, Felix can reveal.
Data obtained from
Freedom of Information
requests show Professor
Gast last year claimed
nearly £44,000 in ex-
penses, mainly for travel
abroad.
The expenses claimed
are slightly higher than
the median salary for em-
ployees at Imperial, and
come on top of her annual
salary of £433,000. A
Felix report earlier this
year revealed Imperial
spends more on senior
staff salary than any other
Russell Group university,
with key management
personnel receiving £5.6
million last year.
Professor Gast’s
expense bill is one of the
highest for any Russell
Group vice-chancellor,
with the average Russell
Group university head
claiming under £10,000
a year. The next highest
expenses bill came from
Professor Koen Lamberts,
Vice-Chancellor of the
University of York, who
claimed £20,743.20,
under half claimed by
Professor Gast.
The vast majority of
the £43,965 claimed back
by Professor Gast was
spent on trips abroad:
in 2016/17 she claimed
back expenses for 16 trips
around the world, includ-
ing over £26,000 spent
on three trips to America.
She spent a further £6890
on a trip to India, and
over £7000 on trips to
other countries in Europe,
including a visit to Davos,
where she spoke on
‘Maintaining Innovation’.
The remainder of her
expense claims were for
taxis, gifts, and ‘hospital-
ity’.
Other members of
senior leadership at Im-
perial had a wide range of
expense claims: Professor
James Stirling, Provost
of Imperial, who will
be retiring this summer,
last year claimed under
£1,500. This included
nearly £500 for office
equipment. The furthest
trip he claimed for was a
visit to Cambridge.
