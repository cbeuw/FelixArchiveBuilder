mperial’s senior
management team
last year claimed
nearly £200,000 on
Beanie Babies, Hang-
man can reveal.
In an investigation
undertaken by Hangman,
a series of Freedom of
Information requests re-
vealed powerful members
of College faculty had
spent vast sums of
money on the small plush
animals. Internal claims
from senior management
show Professor Alice
Gast, President of Impe-
rial College London, last
year claimed back the
£80,000 she had spent
on the toys; it is believed
that, over the previous
five years, members of
senior management had
amassed a collection of
nearly 25,000 Beanie
Babies – enough for one
each for every student and
staff member.
Following the findings,
members of senior man-
agement defended
the spending. Francis
McNally, Vice Provost
(True ‘90s Kids), spoke
to Hangman about the
findings: “While on the
surface, this may seem
like a personal indulgence,
in actuality this represents
a fundamental aspect of
the College’s investment
strategy. Beanie Babies
are a solid investment
for the College – they’re
collectors items, which
are actually in very high
demand. You only need
to have a quick scan of
eBay to see how much an
original, mint-condition
Princess Diana memorial
bear can fetch. The only
way their value can go is
up. Trust me, I’ve visited
the Business School
before.”
The spending was
widely criticised by
student and union repre-
sentatives, however. One
staff member who spoke
to Hangman called the
spending “obscene”, high-
lighting the reduction in
pay experienced by Impe-
rial staff: “it’s absolutely
out of order that Professor
Gast and the others are
spending College money
on their premium stuffed
toys, while the rest of us
have to make do with
poor quality knock-offs
When will the Beanie Baby bubble burst? // Imperial/Flickr/Housing Works Thrift Shops
from IKEA. Things need
to change.”
Other members of
senior staff were found to
be spending vast amounts
on things tangentially-re-
lated to their jobs: one of
Imperial’s core manage-
ment personnel had spent
nearly £5,000 on Club
Penguin subscriptions.
Speaking to Hangman
on the condition of ano-
nymity, the staff member
explained how he’d spent
so much: “I had to keep
on buying new subscrip-
tions throughout the year;
I kept on getting banned
for telling other users to
stay the fuck away from
my puffles”.

The Library has been
designated a Site
of Special Scientific
Interest, after tropical
plants were found
growingonlevelthree.

mperial College
London’s Central
Library has been
declared a Site of
Special Scientific Inter-
est (SSSI), after several
varieties of rare tropical
plant were found to be
growing on level three.
The plants, which
usually only grow in
the Amazon rainforest,
were discovered behind
a bookshelf in the fluid
mechanics section. It is
the first time such species
have grown in the British
Isles.
Professor Barry
Luglow, chair of botanical
sciences at Imperial’s
Faculty of Natural
Sciences, said the find
was “hugely exciting” for
plant-enthusiasts: “pre-
vious attempts to grow
these species in tropical
hot houses in the UK had
always failed, since there
was not enough power
available to generate
the right amount of heat
and moisture. However,
having hundreds of un-
dergraduates packed into
the overstuffed Central
Library has resulted in a
climate akin to the sub-
tropics.”
Student reaction to the
discovery was mixed.
Sally Porter, a second
year biology student, told
Hangman: “naturally I’m
thrilled about this discov-
ery. It really helps make
the climate control prob-
lems we’ve been facing
worthwhile – last week I
slipped over in a puddle
of sweat, and cracked a
rib, but knowing we’re
making scientific history
makes me forget the
pain.”
Others were less
enthusiastic, however.
James Bonnet, a final year
physicist, told Hangman:
“yeah, I’m pleased for
the plants and whatever,
but that doesn’t make up
for the fact the Library
is fucking gross at the
moment. When I walk in I
can feel myself breathing
in the humid sweat of
hundreds of nervous un-
dergrads. It’s disgusting.”

This week the weather
matches your mood. It’s
pathetic fallacy. That’s
right, I did English
GCSE, bitch.
This week you’ve finally
finished your exams.
Now to get back to
your regular routine of
complete mediocrity.
This week you decide
to take all your Central
Library breaks outside.
People can’t see your
tears in the rain.
This week you’re a joke
about GDPR emails.
You’re already old and
tired.
This week you resort
to googling some of
the terms used in the
Felix Sex Survey. The
government now has you
on a watchlist.
This week revision is
going so bad you start
googling whether being
struck by lightning
counts as extenuating
circumstances.
This week you get into
your exam, and the paper
is full of mistakes! You
can barely understand a
thing! Then you leave and
realise it’s just because
you’re an idiot.
This week you’re looking
so hard for means of
procrastination, you
nearly vote in the Union
elections. You’re not
quite that desperate yet,
though.
This week you take a step
back from your studies,
taking time to be mindful
and focus on the real
questions. Like, just how
do they get curly fries
that curly?
This week you forget
it’s half term, and decide
to head down to South
Kensington station at
6pm. You’re never seen
again.
This week you’re the
Horoscopes Writer, and
you’re so uninspired you
nearly turn to r/humour
for inspiration. Nearly.
