Theory of Bastards: the short distance between man
and animal
Audrey Schulman’s novel explores a dizzying array of topics, from modern technology to primal relationships. It
doesn’t always hit the mark, but when it does it soars.
T
here is something
slightly off-put-
ting about our
simian cousins
– those gorillas, chimpan-
zees, and bonobos who
seem so human-like and
yet also so distant from
us. We know that many
such species behave in
ways similar to humans
– they exhibit complex
social behaviour, are
self-aware, and are able
to communicate with us
to a remarkably proficient
degree. At the same time,
however, there remains
a distance between them
and us, which catches
at the back of the mind
– perhaps it’s a sense of
the uncanny, or how they
remind us, unwelcomely,
how we are all merely
animals.
This idea of distance
is present throughout
Audrey Schulman’s
Theory of Bastards,
a dystopia-cum-dra-
ma-cum-science-fiction
book based off a mountain
of scientific research.
Early on in the novel,
we’re presented with
a reminder of just how
powerful these creatures
can be: Dr. Frankie Burk
is a brilliant young evo-
lutionary scientist, fresh
from winning a MacAr-
thur Genius Grant, who
has come to a research
facility in a near-future
America to study the
mating habits of bonobos.
On her second day at the
Foundation, she tries out a
carnival-style strength test
game, to see which animal
she’s equivalent to – she
gets the ring-tailed lemur,
which weights only five
pounds. The bonobos
she’ll be studying weigh
70, meaning she’ll need to
tread carefully.
But, of course, Frankie
is also hampered by the
fact she’s recovering from
radical surgery to try and
cure her endometriosis,
which has caused her ex-
cruciating pain throughout
her life, and hardened her
attitudes to those around
her.
Schulman weaves
a complex narrative,
looping back and forth
between Frankie’s early
life, warped by her daily
pain, and her current
research, related to her
groundbreaking ‘theory
of bastards’ – the idea that
women cheating on their
partners has evolutionary
benefits for the species as
a whole. Alongside this
we’re presented with a
romance plot, a survival
drama, and a quasi-dysto-
pian backdrop. It proves
to be slightly too much
at times, with different
themes developed
half-heartedly in tandem,
rather than individually
“Fluid
descriptions
of pain recur
through the
novel, and are
its strongest
moments”
and fully.
Schulman writes with
a short, sharp prose style
– contracted sentences
fire out rapidly, drawing
the reader’s attention on.
This method really comes
into its own with the
descriptions of pain and
endometriosis Schulman
uses throughout the book
– it’s probably one of the
only books I’ve read that
deals so rawly with the
condition, which affects
10% of women across
the globe. Schulman
explores how pain can be
beneficial – “the mother
to us all, slapping us
back from the hot stove,
forcing us to put down
the sharp knife…training
care into our bones” –
but that the chronic pain
felt by Frankie “was
not a mother. It was an
abuser…it wrapped itself
around the ribs, settled on
the shoulders, a weight to
be borne…pain like this
did not open up the world;
it erased it bit by bit. Over
time it erased her love of
yard sales, of eating, of the
simple act of laughing.”
Fluid descriptions like
this recur throughout the
novel, and are by far its
strongest moments.
everyone has implants
that essentially graft a
smart phone directly into
their eyes. The hysteria
around the technology
never quite reaches a
fever pitch, which is a
good thing, since it makes
the developments that
much more believable.
But references to outdated
bioware, and mysterious
symbols that begin ac-
cumulating on Frankie’s
viewscreen – which we
presume must symbolise
something much more
sinister than the need for
an update – fail to develop
into anything substantial.
Similarly, we begin the
novel expecting to get
more of a backstory of
her research assistant
Stotts – an ex-soldier who
brings a quiet reserve to
the research project – but
this isn’t forthcoming.
There is a clear division
between the two main
sections of the book.
Frankie starts by gaining
the trust of the bonobos
she is studying, gradually
getting more and more
integrated in their clique.
It is at this point where
Schulman is at her best,
backed up by a dizzying
amount of research
that she outlines in an
addendum at the end of
the novel. A catastrophe
midway through the novel
shifts the tone to a survival
drama, highlighting in the
process how reliant we all
are on our technology. It
doesn’t quite live up to the
promiseofthefirstsection,
and the satirical elements
are slightly obvious, but
it’s still thrilling enough
to keep the pages turning
rapidly. In examining our
relationship with pain,
with each other, and
with modern technology,
Schulman has a lot on
her plate; while Theory of
Bastards doesn’t always
live up to its potential,
where it does, it soars
spectacularly.

THEORY OF BASTARDS

There are a number
of developments that
Schulman doesn’t quite
follow through – the
