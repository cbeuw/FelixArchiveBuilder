appropriation
Comment Writer Jian Li Chew returns, and he’s set on stopping people from appropriating

O
n Wednesday
morning I woke
up to the news
that, horror of
horrors, a white girl in
America wore a qipao/
cheongsam to her prom.
Social Justice Warriors
(SJWs) on the internet
were lambasting and crit-
icising her for culturally
appropriating a traditional
(actually classical: it only
came into existence in the
1920s) piece of Chinese
clothing. Notwithstanding
the fact that cultures
mixed and traded words,
cuisine, and fashion for
the entirety of human
civilisation, and that she
looked amazing, I was
offended. So offended, I
decided to go on a social
justice crusade again,
after an 18-month hiatus.
shirts, and dress pants,
as well as a blue suit.
How dare I appropriate
American, European, and
Japanese culture! I took
everything up to the roof
of my building and set fire
to it. I was left with one
samfu and my underwear.
There were also hardly
any shops in London
selling traditional Chinese
clothing. I don’t think I
planned this out well.
I then sent a message
on WhatsApp to my
mother to burn all my
clothes in my room in
Malaysia. Not only did
I have more articles of
American and European
clothing there, I had a
kurta as well! I ran to my
Indian flatmate’s room,
knocked hurriedly on the
door and apologised to his
sleepy and confused face
about my appropriation
of his beautiful culture.
Right after that, my mum
replied, asking if I had
gone stark raving mad. I
was disappointed by how
brainwashed she was. She
has much to learn.
Realising that I needed
to spread my social justice
crusade to Malaysia, I
typed a frenzied article,
posted in on Facebook
and sent it to every news-
paper and news website in
the country. I wrote about
how people should stop
speaking any language
other than their mother
tongue, stop eating food
from other cultures, stop
wearing traditional clothes
of other cultures, and
burn all of their Western
clothing like I did. Some
people criticised me
for trying to disrupt the
harmony between races.
Some people accused me
of insulting Malay culture.
Some people called me a
race traitor. Some people
cursed at me in Tamil.
them in Chinese. You see,
speaking in English was a
form of cultural appropri-
ation too, and I needed to
stand in solidarity with the
English people. Security
came to escort me out. I
didn’t want to be caught,
so I ran across Queen’s
Gate and was hit by a car.

“I was
offended. So
offended I
decided to go
on another
social justice
crusade”
Mostly people called me
a blooming idiot. My job
done, I decided to go to
university.
That day was Postgrad-
uate Commemoration
Day. Thousands of people
were celebrating gradu-
ation with their families,
wearing – gasp – suits
and gowns! I screamed
at everyone for culturally
appropriating not only
Western clothing, but
education as well. Some
people were offended,
but mostly people didn’t
understand why there
was some guy in his
underwear screaming at
I ruffled through my
cupboard and found I had
a Malay sarong in it. I was
appropriating an element
of Malay culture. I also
realised that my entire
cupboard was made up
of T-shirts, jeans, my
Uniqlo Heattech inner
clothing, shorts, collared
“Atgraduation,
I screamed at
everyone for
appropriating
both Western
clothing and
education”
I woke up in hospital
to see the same nurse who
tended to me the last two
times I went on a social
justice crusade and ended
up in hospital. She refused
to speak to me, except to
say that my injuries were
minor and that I’d be
discharged in a week. She
then threw a copy of the
Daily Mail at me, with
the headline “HALF-NA-
KED CHINESE
MAN SCREAMS AT
EVERYONE AND GETS
HIT BY A CAR”. I was
proud. My crusade was
getting media coverage.
Soon others will join me,
and a movement will rise,
telling people to focus on
real or imagined forms of
getting offended instead
of actual important things
like terrorism, climate
change, or getting a job.
Long live social justice!
End cultural appropria-
tion! Make that girl rue
the day she bought a nice
dress!
