K
nitting Soci-
ety has been
accused of
breaking a
number of election rules
during this election
cycle, including use of
bribery, blackmail, and
threats of physical vio-
lence to secure votes for
candidates.
Knitting Society, or
“KnitSock”, have been
the subject of nearly 100
complaints over the past
week of campaigning,
Hangman can reveal,
as the extent of their
wrong-doings come clear.
The current committee
have been accused of
running “a ring of extor-
tion and voter manipula-
tion comparable to that of
the Sicilian mafia” by one
anonymous Union source,
in order to ensure their
preferred successors are
able to access KnitSock’s
£21.30 budget next year.
A number of students
reported being intimidated
by members of KnitSock
over the past week: “I
was minding my own
business, trying to get
to Fusion before it shut,
when I was cornered by
three girls wearing home-
made balaclava. They
told me I should vote
for Sarah Chung to be
KnitSock’s president ‘if
you know what’s good for
you’. When I told them I
wasn’t a member they just
laughed and told me it was
free; they stood over me
waving knitting needles
until I broke down and
voted for Sarah in front of
them. They then warned
me that ‘snitches get
stitches’. I was terrified”.
KnitSock’sactionshave
gone beyond mere threats
of violence, however:
last week at least three
students had to be taken
work of KnitSock, since
it emerged all three were
competing to be on next
year’s committee. Fur-
thermore, they were done
despite it clearly stating in
the Elections Pack given
to candidates “no knee-
capping”.
Beyond this, members
of KnitSock have been
accused of a number
of other illegal tactics,
including threatening to
leak nude photographs of
rival candidates, several
car bombs which neces-
sitated a bomb-disposal
squad, and not leaving five
feet between each of their
posters on the Sherfield
Walkway.
Speaking to Hangman,

Holly Hackerly, one of the
Union’s Deputy Returning
Officers, and Vice-Lead
on Deepening Democracy,
said: “the Union has been
made aware of a number
of concerns students have
had about KnitSock. De-
mocracy is one of our core
values, and therefore we
take all such accusations
incredibly seriously. We
will be taking the appro-
priate action to ensure
other candidates are also
promoted – perhaps by
sending out an email with
their names – and wish
them a speedy recovery as
they regain the use of their
legs.”
“Voters were
cornered by
committee
members, and
told‘snitches
get stitches’”
to St. Mary’s hospital
after they had their knees
bashed in by unknown
assailants. These attacks

Students were left
surprisedasabsolutely
nothing went wrong
during the week of
campaigning and
voting.

S
tudents at Impe-
rial College Lon-
don have been
left shocked and
confused as Imperial
College Union (ICU)
run an election cycle
without mistakes, errors,
or major fuck-ups.
As voting draws to a
close today, a number of
students have reached out
to Hangman to express
their pleasant surprise
that everything has run
completely smoothly, and
there have been absolutely
no problems of any sort.
Harry Ryan, who is
running for the position of
Council Chair – an arcane
role that nobody really
understands (Ed: maybe
it’s something like the
Spanner Bearer?) – said
he had been “dumbfound-
ed” by the lack of devel-
opments: “I went into this
election cycle really ready
to give the Union some
flak. I’d drawn up a whole
plan, so no matter what
they did I’d be able to
find some way to criticise
them, but this whole week
has been run so smoothly I
really don’t have anything
to say except to offer a
heartfelt apology.”
Kieran Alay, ICU’s
Election Fixer and Deep-
ening Democracy Coor-
dinator, told Hangman
the secret behind the
successful running of
the elections: “it can be
very difficult to run a
good student election,
but after years of people
raising issues, we thought
we’d tackle the problem
head-on. After convening
a working group, we
formulated a strategy
for this year’s elections:
organise everything well
in advance; make sure
people know what they’re
doing; and keep everyone
happy. It’s that simple!”
Not all students were
happy with the change,
however: Oscar Langley,
a second-year biochemist
told Hangman: “I’d really
looked forward to getting
incredibly angry at the
Union about minor infrac-
tions of election rules, but
they had to go and ruin
my fun. Now I’ve actually
got to do my lab report
instead of procrastinating
by picking fights in the
Meet the Candidates
livestream.”
The Felix Editor was
also concerned by the
lack of drama around the
elections: “Well what the
fuck do I have to write
about in the News section
now? Some shite about
the library being too hot?!
Fucking hell.”
Everything has gone fine // ICU
Students shocked as Union run competent election
This week you’re the set
of Meet the Candidates,
and TIME CANDIDATE
PLEASE
This week you’re the
election turnout. Will
you go up? Will you
go down? Will anyone
actually care?!
This week you’re a
member of senior College
management, and the
missed teaching from
the strikes is making it
difficult for you to sleep.
On your huge fucking
bed of money.
This week you’re
Memeperial, and you
seem to be doing a better
job of upholding student
democracy than anyone
else.
This week you take
the time to list all the
societies that have
breached election rules
and send them into the
Union elections team.
They think it’s a bot.
This week you
misunderstand the
‘cashless’ system in place
in the SCR and think
they’re giving away
food. Once you get to the
checkout you max out
your overdraft.
This week you’re
the Deputy President
(Education), and you
want to thank all your
wonderful reps for
another excellent term!
(Horoscope brought to
you by Imperial College
Union)
This week you read new
research saying a healthy
diet will still be cancelled
out by too much salt. You
should probably spend
less time with Union
hacks then.
This week you come to
the conclusion you just
need to write off 2018 as
a whole. All your good
intentions from January
have already turned to
apathy. Here’s to 2019!
This week you spend too
long in Central Library,
and have to go to the
Ethos sauna to cool off.
This week you’re the
Horoscopes Writer, and
you’re bored of doing
horoscopes about how
shit the elections are. It’s
like kicking someone
when they’re down.
