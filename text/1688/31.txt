LION’S CUP – YOU´RE GONNA HEAR ME ROAR
W
hat does
a 7:20am
start, battle
crying, and
Nando’s have in common?
A taekwondo tournament
weekend, that’s what.
On the 11th of February,
seven ICU Taekwondo
competitors brought
home five gold medals,
one silver, and one bronze
from the Lion’s Cup
Taekwondo Tournament,
held at Nottingham Trent
University Sport’s Centre.
We left the afternoon
before, piling into one of
the college’s minibuses
-which thankfully didn’t
break for this competition-
and arriving in the early
evening. The disorganised
half of us hadn’t prepared
dinner. The solution?
Nando’s! It’s just protein
and good carbs, making
it the perfect pre-com-
petition food -PS: not
sponsored-, as confirmed
by our coaches.
With the fire alarm at
the hotel going off as we
headed to bed, our excite-
ment turned to tension as
we dreaded the 7:20am
meeting time the next day.
We woke up and the
morning was cold. The
journey from the hotel
was cold. Weigh-in was
also cold. Competitors
started taking naps on the
gym floor. But as the day
progressed and the com-
petition started, things
started to get heated.
Lion’s Cup launched
the first poomsae
(patterns) competition
of the year. Three golds
were obtained by Huey
Shan Tey, Junling Ong
Little is known about
Poomsae outside of
the Taekwondo world.
However, each pattern
requires skill, accuracy,
and far greater muscle
control than sparring, the
fighting variant. With so
many successes, ICUTKD
is without a doubt one of
the best university clubs in
the country for poomsae.
Triumphant in
poomsae, spirits were
high, but kicks were even
higher as fights began.
Four 10mx10m rings were
set up in line, cordoned
off by massive signs sep-
arating competitors from
the cheering crowds. Not
only did Joon-Ho Son win
gold in WTF sparring, but
Angela Sun also achieved
gold in ITF sparring.
Finally, the arduous work
and passion of these two
first-year students paid
off.
Massively successful,
ICUTKD left Lion’s Cup
in second place for the
overall UK Taekwondo
University rankings, but
more importantly, took
first place in the Indomita-
ble Cup, where points are
allocated based on wins
per number of competi-
tors – a better measure of
the quality of competitors.
With Student Nationals
coming up this weekend,
ICUTKD is hoping to
secure the Indomitable
Cup, and qualify as many
players as possible for the
European Student Nation-
als. So keep an eye out on
for the final results!
Special thanks to
instructors, coaches,
members, volunteers and
committee for dedicating
their time to getting us to
the top!

Imperial beat Oxford at baseball (at least once)
T
he Imperial
Baseball and
Softball club
played a league
game against Oxford a
few weekends ago. Many
of the club’s players were
unavailable that week-
end though, so Daniel
Kok borrowed a friend
from his old university’s
baseball team to fill in for
the game. Despite this le-
gitimate substitution, the
team was still one player
short of a full team.
The game begun and
Oxford came out strong in
the top of the first inning,
scoring five runs against
Imperial. Despite the
pressure put on the team,
the Imperial Falcons had
faith in themselves to level
the score, “I hope Daniel
gets struck out so I don’t
have to bat next” said
Jake Lee. Jake’s optimism
carried him to first base,
thus passing the pressure
to Jonathan Cheung who
was making his first plate
appearance since acci-
dentally scoring a run for
UCL. Discovering abili-
flawless second inning to
deny Oxford from scoring
any runs. Veteran Edo Lisi
scored soon after to take
the lead for the Falcons.
From Imperial’s fielding,
you could barely tell that
they were a man down.
Silky double plays were
being made and bullets
were being thrown by
Kaptain Kok and Andrew
Counsell to first baseman
Joe Ronan. Hours of the
‘training drill’ pepper had
paid off; everyone was
getting hits and runs to
maintain Imperial’s lead.
However, Oxford
picked up 4 runs in their
last half inning. Imperial’s
3 run lead had become a
one run deficit. Though,
Joe Coulson stole his way
round the bases to score
a game saving run. Two
outs, the last inning, and
the scores tied... Jonathan
found himself at the plate
again. With the fate of the
game (and a 100% regu-
lation baseball bat) in his
hands, he waited for the
right pitch before making
a huge hit to centre field.
Described by Edo as a
“magnificent walkoff”,
this clutch hit meant the
Imperial Falcons had
stolenthewinfromOxford
at the very last second!
Despite his Valiant effort,
Jonathan failed to score
any runs for himself this
game. He blames Joe
Ronan for getting struck
out at crucial moments.
Joe was forgiven when the
team found out his lung
collapsed mid game.
Unfortunately the
score to the second game
was lost somewhere
on the trek home from
Harlington and the writer
cannot remember who
won. Joe Ronan also does
not remember the score,
but commented that “this
(lung collapse) is bants,
we beat Oxford with one
less player and one less
lung”.
ICURFC 2s STILL ON TOP
S
o far this season,
Imperial 2nd XV
have been a force
to reckon with,
their latest game proving
again how strong this team
has been. It first started
with some fast paced
back and forth rugby, both
teams showing strong
runs of play. Eventually,
after an intense 10 mins,
Imperial managed to open
the scoring. A strong run
by Cowen, followed by
several textbook phases,
led to ICURFC’s welshi-
est welshman Ifan Dafydd
slipping round the outside
of the defence to score
under the posts. Fraser
with the conversion meant
Imperial were up 7-0.
Not long after, pressure
from the Imperial defence
caused their 10 (one of the
biggest/chunkiest fly halfs
ever seen, it was very
confusing, was he a 10?)
to slice a kick. The ball
went sideways, straight
into the hands of Imperial.
It ended with Dowkes
pulling off a naughty step
and scoring a try whilst
pointing and smiling at
the guy he stepped. A bit
harsh, considering both
the guy’s ankles had just
been broken. The kick
was no good- Fraser
had the accuracy, but
not the power. He will
no longer skip leg day.
Unfortunately, just before
the break, some strong
running from Kings’
forwards (and some very
debatable tackle attempts
from Imperial) meant the
score at the end of the first
half finished 12-7. The
opposition had their heads
up and started the second
half like they finished the
1st half, with another try.
Frankly, it was hard to
keep count of the number
of missed tackles, with
Imperial players flying left
right and centre. At 14-12
down, Imperial needed
to do something. Temp
coach Elliot Quigley
made some power sub-
stitutions, which caused
a well-needed increase
in intensity. Quigley for
future England manager?
After some attacking pres-
sure, great hands between
Gustave and Gianluigi
lead to an Italian (Gian)
scoring a try, which is
a rare sight these days,
those poor Italians. It did
make up for the awful
offload attempt Gian had
made earlier. It was just
awful. Why Gian, why?
With boosted confidence,
and after some ‘manly’
screaming from captain
Wheaton after a boot
to the face, Imperial
scored again. This time
it was off a scrum with
no-longer-temp-coach
Quigley going blind,
Kirrane, who proved he
was the fastest ginger of
the team (sorry Jack and
Elliot), by outpacing the
winger and full back to
score in the corner. It was
scored with some well-de-
served showboating, as
the match finished 29-14
to Imperial, a BP win. A
few shoutouts: 1. Well
done to Rob for scrapping
with almost every opposi-
tion player 2. Rohit always
crying about people scor-
ing on his wing and him
never getting a chance,
poor baby 3. Doobie D
keeping the bench all nice
and warm, it was needed
for the ‘injuries’ (looking
at you Koide and Cowen).
Overall a tough game, but
a great performance by
the boys.

ties never seen before in
training, Jonathan swung
hard and sent the ball deep
into outfield to bat in the
