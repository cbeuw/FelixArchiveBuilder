2018 IMPERIAL
CINEMA SPRING
ALL-NIGHTER
B
ring on Spring!
There’s nothing
quite like a
night of films
to get rid of those wintry
chills. Imperial Cinema is
showing SIX award-win-
ning films back-to-back
from 20th
March 6pm to
8am the next morning.
Don’t forget your pillows
and blankets!
18:00 Coco
Pixar on top form yet
again. With a vibrant
Mexican-themed setting
and a raft of catchy
tunes, Coco is a treat for
the senses that won Best
Animated Feature Film
at the Oscars. Join young
Miguel as he navigates
the complexities of family
issues in a not-so-familiar
land of the dead. Keep
the tissues at hand for the
Academy Award-winning
song ‘Remember Me’!
20:40 Black Panther
No Imperial Cinema
All-Nighter is complete
without a superhero
film! Proving that a film
with a black director and
predominantly black cast
can become the second
highest grossing Marvel
film, Black Panther will
hopefully mark a sea-
change in mentality in
Hollywood. If all these
political issues are starting
to turn you off, we under-
stand. Be assured that it’
also just a really kick-ass,
fun, visually stunning
film.
Pan’s Labyrinth fame)
explores what it means
to be a monster in this
strangely twisted Cold-
War-era fairytale, which
bagged four Oscars,
including Best Picture and
Best Director.
01:55 The Post
With such illustrious
individuals as Steven
Spielberg, Tom Hanks,
and Meryl Streep behind
it, The Post is bound to
be a scoop. The true story
of Katharine Graham, the
first female publisher of
a major American news-
paper (The Washington
Post), racing The New
York Times to expose a
government cover-up in
the 1960s.
04:05 Three Bill-
boards Outside Ebb-
ing, Missouri
Not all superheroes
wear capes. Or save lives.
Or even help others. But
they all seem to have one
thing in common: tragic
loss. Frances McDormand
received an Academy
Award for her perfor-
mance of a sassy, badass
and violent mum seeking
justice for her daughter’s
murder. But beneath the
attitude lies a universal
motif of tragedy and our
reaction to it.
06:10The Florida Pro-
ject
The night is no longer
young, and neither are we.
Thetransitiontoadulthood
can be hard, but that’s not
to mean childhood should
be forgotten. Have your
heart slowly broken as
you watch ten-year olds
blissfully enjoying their
carefree days even while
the burdens of adulthood
unravel the lives of the
grownups around them.
The Spring All-Nighter
takes place on Tuesday
20th
March in the Union

floor

Quad. Tickets are £10

Water
Love is never easy.
Not when he’s from
another species, and your
employer – his kidnappers
and only the most funded
military in the world –
strongly disapproves.
