DANCE IMPERIAL
SHOW 2018
F
or the fourth
year in a row the
talented dancers
at Imperial have
come together to show
you what they are made
of. The DI Show 2018
returns next week!
The show is a collab-
orative venture between
the six dance societies at
Imperial (Belly Dance,
Dance Club, Dance
Company, Funkology,
ICSM Dance, Pole &
Aerial) brought together
under Dance Imperial
(DI). Every year exciting
collaborations are chore-
ographed to celebrate the
differing styles and high-
light their similarities.
Expect to marvel at the
fusions of contemporary
& jazz, cabaret belly
& tap, and a few more
exciting crossovers!
Not a dancer? Or not
sure what the dance
styles are? Here is a brief
overview of what you
can expect to see! In this
year’s show we have:
traditional (cabaret) belly
dance, tribal fusion belly
dance (blending modern
dance with traditional
belly), Hiphop & founda-
tion (grooves, popping,
locking), breakdance,
pole, aerial, ballet,
contemporary, jazz, tap,
ballroom, tango, latin,
salsa, and Bachata. All of
these styles hold weekly
classes and rehearsals,
offering beginner level
classes...so if you feel
inspired after the show
just give it a go. There
is just so much dance at
Imperial to choose from
– if only you could be
studying dance rather than
stuck in the library!
Whether it be from the
winter workshop weekend
in November, to chore-
ographer speed dating,
creating exciting fusions
for the show or the many
hours spent rehearsing,
the DI Committee has
worked tirelessly to ensure
its ethos – collaboration
between all the dancers at
imperial – flourishes. The
show promises to cele-
brate all this hard work.
Bell Dance, Dance
Club, Dance Company,
Funkology, and Pole &
Aerial have all competed
in many competitions
across the country this
year before the show.
Between them they have
won numerous awards
and you will get the
chance to view these
fantastic pieces on stage!
ICSM Dance have also
been working hard behind
the scenes and are excited
to perform.
If that wasn’t enough
you will also witness
this year’s four perfor-
mance-only collaboration
pieces. This is the only
opportunity to watch
these spectacles in one
awe-inspiring show.
