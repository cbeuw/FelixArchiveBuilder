The Northern Lights are one of the nature’s most miraculous phenomena. Travel writer Exploring Hobbit was

T
he enchanting
Aurora Borealis,
or northern
lights, frolic in
the sky when charged
particles from the sun
become trapped in the
Earth’s magnetic field,
emitting colourful lights
of green, scarlet, crimson,
and more. The lights un-
ravel themselves usually
on dark clear nights. It
is proposed that the best
times to see them are near
the equinoxes in March
and September, when
geomagnetic storms are
likely to occur more often.
One of the best spots to
see the Northern Lights is
Abisko, Sweden. Abisko
is an extremely small
village and as of 2005,
its population was only
85 people! In addition, it
is very remote and hence
blessed with minimal light
pollution as the nearest
town, Kiruna, is located
approximately 93km
away. Abisko, and in
general northern Sweden,
is consistently ranked as
one of the best and most
reliable places to see the
Northern Lights.
Getting to Abisko
The fastest way to get
to Abisko from London
is by catching a flight to
Kiruna. Carriers, such
as Norwegian Airlines
and SAS, offer this route
but they normally stop
over at Stockholm for
about an hour. There is a
shuttle service that goes
to Abisko from the Kiruna
airport and also from
Kiruna town. Depending
on the flight, this could
be the most economical
way to get to Abisko. Al-
ternatively, you can take
the overnight train from
Stockholm to the Abisko
train station (Abisko
Östra) via Kiruna, which
lasts for about 17 hours.
What to do in Abisko
Since Abisko is a
small village, there is
really nothing much
to do throughout the
day. Most activities are
done outdoors, such as
hiking, cross-country
skiing, dogsledding, and
snow mobiling, although
these are usually quite
expensive (of course, it is
Scandinavia!). At night,
you can join the Northern
Lights tour, though gener-
ally the Lights are visible
from any location in the
village. Most people walk
to the Abisko National
Park, where the sky is
pitch black at night and
thus perfect for aurora
viewing.
An alternative to
spending your entire trip
in Abisko is staying in
Kiruna for a couple of
nights, which is also a
renowned destination
to see the colourful
lightshow. It is also in
the vicinity of more
attractions, such as the
Kiruna Church and
the ICEHOTEL. The
ICEHOTEL in the village
of Jukkasjärvi near
Kiruna is the world’s first
ice hotel and is rebuilt
into a different guise each
year with only ice and
snow. Apart from being a
hotel, it houses an ice art
hall featuring a collection
of suites, ice rooms,
ceremony halls, chande-
liers, and galleries. It also
contains an ice bar that
serves drinks in glasses
made of ice. Although
it could be costly to stay
there, you could still enjoy
this amazing attraction by
joining guided tours such
as the ICEHOTEL 365,
which costs 200 Swedish
kronas for students.
The unpredictable
Winter in Sweden can
be unpredictable, espe-
cially in the northern part
of the country. Raging
snowstorms mean unclear
skies and therefore
curtailed luck of seeing
the Lights. Furthermore,
trains and flights may
be cancelled or delayed
for up to several days in
such wretched weather.
Finally, just like London’s
weather, the Northern
Lights themselves are very
unpredictable. Therefore,
use a Sky Guide app to
find out the dark hours and
the local weather of your
location. Since dark sky
is pivotal, some say that
moonless nights would be
the best.
