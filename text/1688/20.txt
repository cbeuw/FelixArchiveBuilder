A brief, mostly wrong history of punk rock, part II
The saga continues, covering ‘76 to the mid-90s or so. Stay tuned for Part III, where I’ll wrap this shit up.
W
elcome to
the history
of punk
rock, part 2.
Part 1 was in the last edi-
tion of Felix - get caught
up online. Now, history.
Anarcho-punk emerged
in the UK in the late 70s
and early 80s. Crass was
one of the foremost bands
(“Do they owe us a living?
/ of course they fucking
do!”). Bands like The
Mob and Chumbawam-
ba lived in communes
and advocated for an
anarchist alternative. The
subgenre peaked when
Crass songs were quoted
against Thatcher in Par-
liament, with regards to
the Falklands war. This,
along with an attempted
prosecution by a Tory MP
for obscenity, prompted
them to call it quits. The
band briefly reunited in
2011 for The Last Supper,
which featured a rendition
of “Do They Owe Us A
Living?” in the original
drums-and-vocals style.
Meanwhile, US punk
diverged. This was the era
of hardcore.
Inspired by John
McLaughlin and Chick
Corea, Mind Control
was formed in 1976 as
a jazz-fusion ensemble.
Exposed to punk in the
closing years of the
decade, the band recast
itself as Bad Brains and
began tearing up the DC
area with blisteringly fast
beats and gritty waves of
reggae-inspired, distorted
skanking.
The DC scene was
huge. Minor Threat, The
Untouchables, Govern-
ment Issue, Gray Matter,
and Dag Nasty all hail
from the area. So does
Henry Rollins, who grew
up in the area and joined
Black Flag in 1981 (which
later relocated to the west
coast).
The west coast was host
to a slew of other acts – the
Descendents, The Dead
Kennedys, The Circle
Jerks, The Germs, Reagan
Youth, and Suicidal
Tendencies (for whom
Thundercat used to play
bass) – ‘California Uber
Alles’, in the words of
the Dead Kennedys. The
Kennedys are known for
political raunch (‘Holiday
in Cambodia’, ‘Kill the
Poor’, ‘Nazi Punks Fuck
Off’, and so on). The
Descendents had a more
melodic style (Milo Goes
to College is their greatest
identified by the “oozin’
ahhs,” soaring three-part
vocal harmonies over their
riffs (their big experimen-
tal albums were Recipe
for Hate and Generator
– give ‘em a listen), and
a big focus on religion;
having come of age during
a time of exceptional
zealotry in American
culture, the anti-religion
take was controversial,
raw, and perfect for the
punk rock scene. NOFX,
on the other hand, wrote
album after album of
ridiculous wordplay (see
their seminal album Punk
in Drublic, or one of my
favorite albums, Pump Up
The Valium, featuring hits
like ‘My Vagina’, ‘Phar-
macist’s Daughter’, and
‘Herojuana’). As a side
note, check out the credits
on Drublic: “Fat Mike -
double chin; Eric Melvin
– dreads; El Hefe – talent;
Erik Sandin – tattoos.”
The third wave of ska
arose around this time.
Green Day’s first gig as
came in 1987 in Berkeley,
at the album launch party
for Energy, the debut
from (and only album by)
Operation Ivy. Ivy was
named after the nuclear
tests, and played with a
skanked guitar sound that
slayed – that album is
jam-packed with frenetic
energy. Energy became
one of the defining albums
of the ska-punk scene, and
had a massive influence
on future Californian acts
like Sublime. The Mighty
Mighty Bosstones of
Boston and the Voodoo
Glow Skulls of Riverside,
California were among
the first to the ska party.
Continuing into the 90s,
Gwen Stefani and No
Doubt became big - as did
Reel Big Fish, Sublime,
Less Than Jake, and
Rancid (formed with half
of the Op Ivy crew). RBF
is particularly well-known
for their peppy songs and
biting lyricism : “I’ve got
a funny feeling / we’re
all born to lose / and
I’ve got a funny feeling
/ that this life ain’t worth
living.” Sublime takes a
generally more mellow
line, but turns up the
punk when appropriate.
40 Oz. to Freedom is a
seminal album (‘Smoke
Two Joints’ and the title
track stand out, plus a Bad
Religion cover, ‘We’re
Only Gonna Die From
Our Own Arrogance’), as
is their self-titled album
(‘Santeria’, ‘What I Got’,
‘Under My Voodoo’).
Sadly, frontman Brad
Nowell died of a heroin
overdose in ‘96, before
Sublime became known
and loved worldwide.
Catch-22 evolved out of
this scene, releasing their
debut, Keasbey Nights, in
1998, when singer-guitar-
ist Tomas Kalnoky was
18. Kalnoky, after univer-
sity, founded Streetlight
Manifesto, and Bandits of
the Acoustic Revolution,
which continue to work in
the ska genre; as on one of
the tunes from Keasbey,
people often refer to SLM
as “fourth wave,” though
no such wave has properly
occurred.
Well, that’s all the space
I got. See y’all next week.

There was a spattering
about the country –
Adrenalin O.D. from New
Jersey, Reagan Youth
(c.f. Hitler Youth) from
New York, and so on.
Hardcore came to define
the American punk rock
sound, and its descendents
are readily visible in the
contemporary scene.
Perhaps the most
notorious member of the
scene was GG Allin, who
promised yearly to kill
himself live on Halloween
(he was always in jail, and
OD’d on heroin before
he could). His antics
included nudity, eating
and rolling in his own
faeces, and violence; his
concerts were usually cut
short by irate venues. He
also put out some great
spoken-word albums. RIP
GG, you maniac.
The sister genre to
hardcore was skate punk,
and that was filled up by
the likes of Bad Religion
and NOFX. Bad Reli-
gion’s songs are easily
