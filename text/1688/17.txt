In the eye of the beholder: the male gaze in visual art
ARTS
Indira Mallik
Arts Editor
T
he term ‘male
gaze’ was coined
by Laura Mulvey
in 1999 in the
context of cinema, in
an essay in which she
described the role of
women in film as “to be
simultaneously looked at
and displayed”: the result
of a heteronormative,
patriarchal society in
which women are ex-
pected to take a passive
role. The concept of the
male gaze was quickly
adopted into the cultural
lexicon because Mulvey’s
observations transcend
the movies – in all forms
of media the (cis, straight,
white) male experience
held up as the norm, it is
the men who have agency,
women are the objects of
consumption.
The pincer grip of the
male gaze on the art world
is exposed pithily by the
Guerilla Girls, an anon-
ymous all-female collec-
tive, in their 1989 pop-art
inspired poster Do Women
Have To Be Naked to Get
Into the Met Museum
which reveals that “less
than 5% of artists in the
ModernArt section (of the
Metropolitan Museum of
Modern Art in New York)
are women, but 85% of
the nudes are female”.
The disparity between
who is object and who
is the subject matters
because at its heart, the
male gaze is primarily
about power. In the arts,
where the currency is
selling a narrative or
having a voice, it boils
downtowhogetstotellthe
story and in what way, and
who must remain a silent
character in the story told
about them. In a climate
where the male gaze pre-
dominates, women artists
who speak out candidly,
not just about wider social
issues but their own lives
are staging minute revolu-
tions.
Openness, transgres-
sion, and intimacy are
at the centre of Tracey
Emin’s on-going neon
series. Since the 1990s she
has created work in which
tubes of neon lighting are
bent into a simulacrum of
her handwriting to spell
out phrases of love, loss,
and rage. Though the
medium has been in use
for decades, Emin’s work
is memorable because
of the sense of personal
disclosure her words seem
unfiltered: I know, I know,
I know, one piece admon-
ishes, the writing getting
bigger with each repeti-
tion, the central phrase
angrily scratched out.
In day-glo brights Emin
makes sentences, which
seem as though they
could be lifted straight
from a diary, intensely
public. Made famous by
the Turner-shortlisted My
Bed, she is no stranger to
blurring the lines between
public and private – some
of Emin’s best work
has tossed aside female
silence – in All the People
I’ve Ever Slept With, she
used the traditionally
female craft of quilting to
create a cocoon-like tent
on which the names of her
lovers, friends and family
are embroidered. Despite
the confessional nature
of Emin’s work, we are
never in doubt who holds
the power, rather than
being exposed, Emin puts
herself on display.
The difference between
unflinchingly open and
voyeuristic work is
evident in Jenny Sav-
ille’s nudes. In her series
Closed Contact Saville
uses thick oils and heavy
brushstrokes to depict
her naked body pressed
tightly against clear glass,
in extreme close up and
at a vast scale, fat and
muscle slide and squash
together to create unex-
pected shapes. Saville
transforms her body into
a landscape: the distorted
swell of her abdomen
and breasts, the curl of
her fingers, the ridges
of her knuckles become
a topography of fleshy
tones. These canvases
zing with energy, they
are sometimes beautiful,
often grotesque, always
compelling. Paintings by
other figurative artists
such as Lucian Freud who
also make nudes their
focus are rendered staid in
comparison.
In the age of social
media platforms that
demand divulsion,
and in a climate where
happily body positivity
is becoming a little more
widespread, Saville and
Emin’s art is more relevant
than ever. However, it is
still depressingly difficult
for women artists to
shares their voices and
stories: when in 2012, the
Guerilla Girls updated
their statistics, 4% of the
artists in the Modern Art
section of the Met. were
women, but 74% of the
nudes were female.
The internet has
provided artists the op-
portunity to circumvent
old institutions altogether.
Funded by feminist
production company The
Front, filmmaking sister
duo Remy and Kelsey
Bennett have made it
their mission to cast the
spotlight on female artists
through the documentary
series Under Her Skin
(available online). In a
series of short episodes
they follow the journey
of contemporary artists
looking to break out:
from 17 year old Pantetha
Abareshi who, like Frida
Kahlo did, paints to com-
municate and transform
her chronic pain, to Jane
Rule Burdine, who at
seventy-one is still active
as a street photographer.
In offering the perspec-
tives of many different
women what Under Her
Skin promotes is crucial
in the campaign for better
representation: the imper-
ative to honour individual,
nuanced experiences,
filtered not only through
the lens of womanhood,
but a prism of intersecting
identities: those of class,
culture, race, sexuality
and age. Doing so will
not only give a voice to
those silenced for so long
but create a richer treasure
trove of art we can all
enjoy.
