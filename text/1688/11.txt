From Jaws to jaws: the impact of shark-fin soup
O
ver forty years
ago, a film was
released into
cinemas that
would forever haunt those
swimming in the open sea.
But the main star of Jaws,
the infamous great white
shark, sadly has more to
fear from humans than we
do from them. While we
may think of sharks prey-
ing upon us, in this case it
is humans that are at the
top of the food chain.
Shark fin soup, a tradi-
tional dish in several East
and SoutheastAsian coun-
tries, requires the usual
ingredients for a soup:
broth, salt, and maybe a
mushroom or two. But,
as the name indicates,
it also requires shark
fins. As animal-based
products go, it is not one
with a pleasant collection
method: fishermen catch
individual sharks, before
slicing off the fins to
be processed, sold, and
consumed in the soup.
They are not fastidious
about the shark species
when obtaining the fins,
nor are they picky about
the treatment of the shark
after the fins are collected.
The finless individuals are
thrown back overboard
to face a restricted life at
the bottom of the ocean –
unable to swim again.
It may seem obvious
that there is the need
to find a more ethical-
ly-sourced soup to serve,
but shark fin soup serves
as a status symbol, pre-
sented at several special
occasions, one being
weddings. The traditional
dish originates from the
10th
century where it was
a Chinese emperor’s dish
of choice. More recently,
it has slowly begun to
dwindle out of fashion
as charities, such as the
Hong Kong Shark Foun-
dation, continue efforts
to increase awareness of
the soup’s preparation
methods.
neyland in Hong Kong.
Having originally planned
on serving the soup as a
sign of respect to local
residents, the corporation
ultimately decided against
it. More recently, several
protests have occurred
across the continent at
restaurants serving the
soup with the use of
graphic costumes aimed
at deterring customers
from enjoying their meals.
There have been sugges-
tions that shark finning
could help conservation
efforts, but whether these
claims have legitimate
proof or are merely
convenient arguments is
yet to be seen. Given the
moral implications and
other options available,
shark fin soup seems a
bizarre choice for a meal.
Especially given the fact
that it’s tasteless!
Grantham lecture: a topical discussion with a distin-
guished speaker
F
ollowing the
e s t a b l i s h e d
tradition of his
predecessors, His
Serene Highness Prince
Albert II came to Imperial
to promote ocean conser-
vation. The principality of
Monaco is known to have
led many expeditions
under the leadership of
PrinceAlbert I, the current
prince’s grandfather, and
Jacques-Yves Cousteau,
the famous oceanog-
rapher. These include
creating the first modern
bathymetric map and a
large contribution to the
study of the Gulf Stream.
The lecture, entitled
“The climate change: a
threat to the oceans. The
Ocean: a chance for the
climate”, covered the
main issues facing our
oceans due to pollution
and climate change, such
as acidification. The
Prince spoke of the dif-
ferent initiatives Monaco
had recently put into place
to safeguard this environ-
ment, culminating in the
creation of World Ocean
Summit taking place this
year in Mexico.
He outlined a three-
point strategy towards a
solution to these issues:
rigorous science, compre-
hensive protection, and a
sustainable economy. On
the first point he made
allusions to the work
being done by Imperial
and his foundation.
He then expressed the
need for leaders to urge
reluctant states to stand
up and safeguard the
fragile environment that
is our seas. Finally, the
Prince stressed that the
way forward was through
a Blue Economy, the
sustainable use of ocean
resources for economic
growth, and highlighted
how these solutions were
being implemented in
Monaco.
He also mentioned
the accountability of
individuals in this crisis,
especially with regards
to plastic pollution and
travel, and ended with
a quote from Winston
Churchill: “What is the
use of living, if it be not
to strive for noble causes
and to make this muddled
world a better place for
those who will live in it
after we are gone”.
Although the points
of the lecture were
relevant and interesting,
the speaker struggled to
give them with panache,
and failed to answer the
questions asked by the
audience – namely how
young graduates could
be a part of this new Blue
Economy. Perhaps the
Grantham Institute should
choose future speakers
with an understanding of
their topic as well as noto-
riety if it is to please both
its student and staff body,
as well as the general
public.

ust in times for
Valentine’s Day,
a Sehuencas
water frog named
Romeo had an online
dating profile setup to
search for love. This sort
of thing isn’t usually
newsworthy, except for
the fact Romeo has been
dubbed ‘the world’s
loneliest frog’. He is the
only known individual
of his species, and the
profile was completed
to help raise awareness
to the plight of Romeo’s
species. He has been
in captivity for almost
a decade and has been
calling for a mate ever
since. This isn’t the first
time a lone individual
of a species has been
known to science: in
September 2016, the last
Rabb’s fringe-limbed
tree frog called Toughie
passed away from old age.
Like Romeo, he had been
in captivity for a long
time and unfortunately a
female was never found
are a number of different
factors which are causing
synergistic effects on
amphibian populations
globally. Currently, 41%
of amphibian species
are threatened with
extinction, the highest
rate for any group of
vertebrates. Habitat loss,
pollution, overharvesting,
and disease are some
of the biggest threats
facing amphibians. One
of the main diseases
that caused such rapid
declines in both Romeo’s
and Toughie’s species (as
well as countless others)
is chytridiomycosis. The
disease is caused by a
highly infectious fungus,
and has been implicated
in the global decline of
amphibian populations.
Unfortunately it is
unlikely that a female
Sehuencas water frog will
ever be found, despite
the fact that in the late
1990s they were common
in Bolivia. Even if one
is found, will she be in
a suitable condition to
breed? Will he be too old
by then? It’s sad to think
that although Romeo’s
dating profile has raised
both awareness and funds
to help protect other am-
phibians and their habitats
in Bolivia, it’s likely he
will suffer the same fate
as Toughie. All hope is not
lost as an elusive female
may still be out there in
the Bolivian wilds some-
where and hopefully she
can be paired with Romeo.
With raising threat of
climate change and
other such factors how
long will it be until other
common amphibian
species across the globe
are reduced to only a
handful of individuals?
