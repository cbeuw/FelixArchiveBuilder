Brexit and Ireland: how can we solve the
border crisis?
Brexit is threatening the current status quo with the Irish border. Theresa May has made a
commitment to withdrawing from the single market, but what does this mean for Ireland?

H
ow do you
solve a prob-
lem like the
Irish border?
This appears to be the
biggest stumbling block
in achieving a successful
outcome for Brexit. It
seems an impossible
square to circle. Theresa
May has committed to
withdrawing from the
customs union and single
market, which would
mean there would need to
be border checks between
Northern Ireland and the
Republic of Ireland - this
being the only land border
the UK shares with the
EU - whilst also insisting
that one of her primary
goals is to avoid a hard
border within Ireland.
She hopes to do this in
one of two ways. The first
option would be to set up
a customs partnership,
which would mean the
UK voluntarily mimics
EU regulations for goods,
doing away entirely with
the need for a border.
For this to work, the UK
would need to maintain a
lot of the same regulations
it currently follows due to
EU membership, which
could be achieved through
differingregulatorybodies
and mechanisms. It would
mean the UK would no
longer be legally bound
by the European Court of
Justice but would need to
take note and act on some
of its rulings to ensure
the UK’s regulations are
running as closely parallel
with the EU as possible.
This would also allow the
UK to strike trade deals
with other countries by
avoiding membership of a
customs union.
up following the same
rules as before, even if on
a voluntary basis instead.
If the UK deviates from
agreed standards, then
one would assume that
border posts would need
to be erected to protect
the EU’s internal market
from goods that don’t
meet its standards. This
option therefore appears
incompatible with the
UK’s ability to use its
post-Brexit autonomy to
make meaningful deci-
sions regarding standards.
The second option
Theresa May put forward
in her speech was a
customs arrangement
whereby a smart border
utilising technology could
be erected. This option
would give the UK more
flexibility to deviate away
from the EU’s regulations
and would mean that when
vehicles carrying goods
would ordinarily have to
stop for customs checks,
they would be able to
carry on driving without
the need to stop. This
option is arguably open to
abuse, as both sides would
need to trust that what was
being declared was what
was actually crossing the
border, with no physical
way of checking these
goods. A trusted traders
scheme would alleviate
some concerns but this
system could still be open
to abuse. This leaves
many commentators and
the EU skeptical that this
kind of system could work
effectively.
Given that the options
proposed by the UK
government have obsta-
cles that could be insur-
the Conservatives have
enough votes to govern
a majority in parliament.
The DUP, being a unionist
party in Northern Ireland,
is completely opposed
to any option that would
separate Northern Ireland
from the UK economi-
cally, as this would be an
effective annexation of
Northern Ireland by the
EU in their eyes. It there-
fore appears impossible
to solve the problem of
the Irish border given the
self-imposed red lines
of both the EU and of
Theresa May.
This has massive ram-
ifications for the Good
Friday agreement, which
brought an end to the
troubles and is sponsored
by both the UK and Irish
governments. It ensured
an open border where
communities, people,
and goods could freely
cross from one side to the
other: now, this border
is almost invisible. The
current freedoms and
peace were- hard fought
for on all sides and to risk
this for Brexit appears
like an absurdity, espe-
cially when it is already
under pressure due to
the inability of Northern
Ireland parties to form an
executive for the regional
assembly. Theresa May
has conceded that when
the UK leaves the EU,
the UK and the EU will
still have to stay closely
aligned. Brexit will
allow for bilateral trade
agreements, however,
these will come with
pressures on standards
and visa schemes. Brexit
will garner minimal gains
at best, and could be the
catalyst for constitutional
crisis in Northern Ireland.

mountable, it’s important
to consider the fail-safe
option put forward by
the EU in the event of no
deal being reached. The
fail-safe option proffered
by the EU would be
for Northern Ireland to
effectively remain in the
customs union even if the
rest of the UK doesn’t.
This would effectively
push the border back to
the Irish sea between the
island of Ireland and the
rest of the UK. This option
has been vehemently
opposed by the UK
government as a threat to
the integrity of the UK’s
domestic economy, as
customs checks would
need to be enforced
between Northern Ireland
and the rest of the UK.
The DUP’s involvement is
significant as they ensure
“Is leaving the
EU worth it if
the UK ends up
following the
same rules as
before, even
on a vountary
basis”
However, it does beg
the question of whether
leaving the EU to gain
power and sovereignty
for parliament is worth it
if the UK ultimately ends
