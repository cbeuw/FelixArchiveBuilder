Mallorca is a go-to place for relentless partying and beach holidays alike but travel writer Tom Whiting reveals
the unexpected side of this Mediterranean island.
D
espite its
reputation as a
European party
destination,
there is much more to
Mallorca than drinking
the night away in its nu-
merous party resorts, such
as Magaluf. With a peak
higher than Ben Nevis
in Scotland (the highest
mountain in the British
Isles) and many spots
for hiking and climbing,
this Mediterranean island
offers adventures and
excitement for the more
outdoor-loving students.
On my recent climbing
trip to Mallorca together
with the Imperial Outdoor
Club (that participates in
a wide range of outdoor
pursuits) just before
Christmas, I experienced
a more daring side of
the island. While not
as popular as mainland
Spain for climbing, it
boasts routes spanning
from ‘beginner’ to
‘expert’ levels of diffi-
culty, with more than
enough to satisfy months
of climbing, let alone a
single week. There are
many crags (climbing
spots) around the island,
although by far the biggest
and best one is Sa Gubia.
It offers incredible views
and routes up to 200 m
long, and is well worth the
lengthy walk to the start
of the climb. While we
only managed to squeeze
in one day there due to
logistics and wanting to
visit many of the other
areas on the island, we
could have easily spent the
whole week there as we
only scratched the surface
of what was on offer, with
multiple day-long routes
left for another trip.
One of the other mem-

orable crags was Valldem-
ossa, which is situated just
outside a small village of
the same name and has
incredible views over
the sea. The only real
drawback of the area was
that to ascend the rock we
needed to climb above the
road, so we had to keep
our senses heightened
a bit more than usual.
Besides Valldemossa,
we also managed to visit
several other climbing
areas with great routes
and breath-taking views.
Mallorca is also home
to some of the best Deep
Water Soloing (DWS)
in the world, whereby
climbers don’t use ropes
and rely on falling into
the deep water below that
cushions their fall. Despite
the allure of some of the
best and most challenging
DWS routes in the world,
we decided to stay on the
land as the sea can get a
bit too nippy in December.
Of course, one of the
perks of going to Mallorca
during the off-peak season
is the low cost: return
flights were under £50
and accommodation for
a week was less than £10
per night. Plus, the food
is far better than what
you can expect to get
in London for the same
price, and if you decide to
have a tipple, the wine that
you can get for a couple
of pounds at the local
supermarket goes down a
lot better than cheap UK
wines (the €1.50 Cava is a
particular treat). Although
it’s pretty much essential
to hire a car to get around
and explore the island,
this doesn’t add much to
the overall expenses as it
can cost as little as £35
per week – and if there are
four of you in the vehicle,
it becomes ludicrously
cheap.
While December might
not seem like the perfect
time to visit the Balearic
Islands, the temperature
was still a warm-ish 15°C
and far hotter than the UK
was experiencing. The
slightly lower temperature
is also better for climbing
as the summer highs
of around 30°C make
climbing almost unbeara-
ble. It does get a bit chilly
at night and when the sun
hides behind the clouds or
a rock face, but it’s made
up for by the feeling of
achievement that you can
get when you reach the
top of a climb and can
look down on the route
you’ve just conquered.
So if you harbour even
the smallest interest in the
great outdoors, Mallorca
is certainly well worth a
visit. The low cost of a
trip there should be more
than enough to entice a
student, but the views and
terrain alone easily rival
those of more famous
destinations in Europe
and will hopefully lead to
more tourists going there
to explore the countryside
rather than spending all
night on the Magaluf
Strip.
The IC Outdoor Club
regularly holds both
indoor and outdoor
climbing activities, and,
as well as organising trips
abroad, arranges multiple
trips within the UK each
term for hiking, mountain
biking, climbing, and
more. Contact outdoor@
ic.ac.uk for more infor-
mation.
