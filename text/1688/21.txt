There’s Too Many Man, Too Many Many Man!
In the wake of International Women’s Day, Music Editor Andy Djaba discusses the unfortunate prevalence of
misogyny in hip-hop.
T
his week, Isaac
Freeling and I
hosted Ella and
Tayla from the
“Too Many Man Show”
on our podcast, “2 Gs
in a Pod”, (shameless
plug!) to have an open
and frank discussion
about misogyny in hip-
hop. It’s something I’ve
wanted to write about for
a while and, following our
discussion, I felt inspired
to address the issue. Also,
in light of International
Women’s Day, there’s no
better time to discuss what
we, as fans of the culture,
can do to tackle the unfor-
tunate omnipresence of
misogyny in hip-hop.
The first step is to ac-
knowledge the sexism in
hip-hop. Without getting
too deep into the discus-
sion of disparity within
the genre, misogyny in
hip-hop ranges from the
more obvious examples,
such as vulgar lyrics,
to the subtler instances,
such as the lack of female
artists on the Wireless
Festival line-up or the
bad reputation women
get for being ‘difficult’ to
work with. Female artists
are wrongly assumed to
lack the talent of male
artists, which in turn
deters more women from
getting into the genre.
Unless they maintain a
hyper-sexualised public
image, female hip-hop
artists simply don’t get the
same recognition as their
male counterparts and, as
a result, the narrative that
hip-hop lacks conscious
female MCs is further
perpetuated.
As a genre, hip-hop has
gained a reputation for
not being very accepting
of women and there is a
trend of female MCs being
thrown under the umbrella
of ‘R&B’ or ‘soul’, rather
than hip-hop or rap. R&B
and soul are generally
seen as ‘more feminine’
than hip-hop and, by
throwing any female artist
that incorporates singing
and melody in her music
into the R&B genre, we
effectively disregard them
and fail to consider them
in the conversation of top
rappers in hip-hop. Would
a woman that makes music
in the same way as Drake
(singing and rapping si-
multaneously) be classed
as a hip-hop artist and
judged in the same way
that we rate Drake or any
other man that incorpo-
rates singing and melody
in their music?
As fans of the culture
in general, it is important
that we are intelligent in
our approach to the music.
We need to start thinking
about why we like the
music that we do and be
more aware of when our
favourite artists’ music
crosses the line into what
should be unacceptable
territory. This allows us,
as fans, to take respon-
sibility and hold our
favourite artists account-
able for their problematic
lyrics. There are times
when I think that hip-hop
culture is slowly moving
towards eradicating its
deep-rooted misogyny.
However, it almost
seems like, for every step
taken towards tackling
misogyny, hip-hop takes
two steps backwards.
Artists including sexist
content, such as that of old
school Snoop Dogg, Dr.
Dre and Eminem, would
not be acceptable in this
day and age and this was
evidenced by Rick Ross
losing his Reebok en-
dorsement for including
lyrics which allude to date
rape in his verse on 2013’s
‘U.O.E.N.O.’. However,
while this represented a
major step forward, the
casual acceptance in the
culture of problematic and
abusive artists, such as
R. Kelly and the wave of
mumble rappers who all
seem to have disturbing
histories of domestic
violence, is another
worrying step backward.
To tackle misogyny in
hip-hop, it is important
to shine a light on the
dope female artists in the
scene and celebrate them
just as much as we do our
favourite male artists. The
“Too Many Man Show” is
a brand new website and
podcast dedicated to chal-
lenging hip-hop’s gender
norms and championing
female artists in the genre.
Although hip-hop has
been a genre synonymous
with protest and the plight
of marginalised people,
the genre has historically
been a male-dominated
and carried an anti-wom-
an sentiment. The rank
misogyny pervading the
genre is too often over-
looked. This means that
women taking up space
in hip-hop in general is
a form of activism itself;
they’re taking up space in
a genre that has previously
prided itself on its sexist
undertones and has been
particularly male-dom-
inated for a long time.
This makes it all the more
important to big up artists
like Rapsody, Noname,
Little Simz and more
that are flying the flag for
women within the culture.
We need more outlets
like “Too Many Man” to
ensure that female hip-hop
artists aren’t ignored.
It’s also of paramount
importance that men get
involved in the conver-
sation; it can’t just be the
women getting behind the
movement of challenging
misogyny in hip-hop.
Men have to support the
movement too for there to
be noticeable changes to
one of the ugliest aspects
of the hip-hop culture that
we love so much.
