London Ice Varsity – Imperial retain the trophy
T
he utimate show-
down between
Imperial Devils
and UCL Yetis
took place last Friday in
Streatham. Continuous
pressure put on UCL
proved to be too much for
them to handle, resulting
in a crushing 10:3 victory
for Imperial.
Like many games
before, it proved to be a
challenge, and victory had
to be hard fought. In this
case, however, “fought”
was literal, as there were
two altercations on the
ice. We saw four players
off to the penalty box at
difference was, the game
was hard fought and UCL
were fighting till the very
end.
Ice Varsity is not only
about showing the brutal-
ity of ice hockey, but also
the gentleness of figure
skating, as shown by our
figure skating ensemble
“Angels”. Their perfor-
mance during the first
break between periods left
spectators in awe, as they
performed Waltz jumps
and Salchows through
the air. Proving that ice,
a substance harder than
concrete, can be used
for other things than just
bashing UCL.
The 260 Imperial
spectators attending the
event wanting “…bread
and circuses” were not
disappointed. With plenty
of food and beer provided
at the rink, everyone was
in a good cheer. Which
would be proclaimed to
UCL on several occasions
through various chants.
With Imperial Immortals
(american football) being
at the forefront, with the
most ingenious and witty
chirps.
Usually players are
meant to ignore the
crowd, but it was made
impossible after two
megaphones were brought
in by Imperial. Making it
possible for the most out
of tune, drunken, rendition
of ‘God Save the Queen’
in history.
After the game finished,
everyone either boarded
the rented double-deckers
to the union, or went to
the after party at KOKO.
Imperial Devils celebrat-
ed the victory at the union,
with some overflowing
with joy to such extent,
they had to be taken home
early.
Next year, Devils hope
to defeat Yetis yet again.
And hence will do their
best to practice often and
not disappoint when the
time comes. So if you
missed it out, don’t worry!
Devils will play again in
twelve months’ time, and
it can get only better.
IC Boxing – Imperial beats Bristol
A
fter a success-
ful trio hit up
the BUCS
national boxing
championship (almost a
record-breaking number
of fighters for Imperial
College Boxing Club),
we managed to churn up a
further two specimens of
fight-worthy material for
Bristol’s notorious Fight
Night. Jie Rou, a fresher
in Civil Engineering
decided to move on from
Chinese Kick-Boxing to
regular old-school Boxing
this year and Dave, in his
3rd year of Mechanical
Engineering, joined IC
Boxing last year, but they
were both fighting for the
first time.
On Saturday 24th
February, Jie Rou and
David were accompanied
by our two Imperial
coaches, George Burton
and TerenceAkinlade, and
made their way down for
what was to be a tremen-
dously smashing evening
of boxing. The event was
a mass sell-out, with over
300 people in the crowds
and 10 fights overall. With
such a huge turn-out and
atmosphere bursting with
excitement, the pressure
was on for IC Boxing to
perform.
First up was Jie Rou,
our shining star from
Singapore. On a regular
day you’ll find her smiling
and generally being an
all-round nice gal. An
‘all-round nice gal’, until
it’s time to be in the
ring that is! She told me
afterwards she felt so bad
for punching the other
girl in the face, because
the Bristol Boxing Club
had been so nice! Well I
tell you now, that’s not
what it looked like in
the ring. She maintained
some awesome slipping
and rolling and her clean-
cut style allowed her to
catch her opponent out
every opportunity she left
herself open. In the end,
the judges came to an
uncontested decision to
crown her victorious.
Dave was up 3rd and
started out strong, keeping
up his defence and
throwing well-timed jabs
and hooks towards his
opponent. He maintained
his ground for the first two
rounds, but it was very
close. The final round was
a tie-breaker. Unfortu-
nately, his opponent came
back strong, managing
to strike a shot, causing
the ref to step in and do a
standing count. Dave got
hit by a flurry of punches
in the last few seconds just
as the whistle was blown.
It came to a split decision,
but unfortunately the
judges gave the fight to
his opponent.
It was not all that bad
for Dave though, because
pre-fight he was already
over the moon about the
match. The ‘match’ being
not his own but the rugby
Scotland v England Six
Nations - with a 25-13
final score, why would
any Scotsman not be?
Anyway, he took the
loss on his chin, and
celebrated Scotland’s win
with plenty of food and
bevvies at the end of the
night. Happy days for
everyone!
