The audit, which
assessed first-year
feedback, showed
some departments
had room to improve
on feedback times.
Fred Fyles
Editor-in-Chief
A
n audit of first
year assess-
ments from
last term,
organised by Imperial
College Union (ICU),
has found a large range
in how promptly depart-
ments provide feedback.
While nearly 90%
of assessed feedback
last term was returned
within the recommended
ten working day time-
frame, there was a wide
range from department
to department. Overall
the Faculty of Natural
Sciences returned the
Sir David Greenaway.
Vice-chancellors at the
universities of Exeter and
Oxford both took pay cuts
of less than 1%.
High-Earners
In addition to the sala-
ries of KMPs and the pres-
ident Alice Gast, Imperial
also has one of the highest
numbers of staff earning
more than £100,000.
Most of Imperial’s 410
high earners fall into the
£100,000-£110,000 pay
band and 130 are paid
more than £150,000. One
Only Oxbridge have more high-earners than Imperial
individual takes home
£460,000-£470,000.
Only Oxford and Cam-
bridge have more high
earners than Imperial (485
and 472 high earners re-
spectively). Of these, the
majority are again in the
£100,000-£110,000 range.
The top salaries at Ox-
bridge however are vastly
greater than any other
Russell Group university:
Oxford employees earn
up to £890,000 and Cam-
bridge pays £650,000 to
one individual.
The numbers of high
earners increased between
2016 and 2017 at the vast
majority of Russell Group
universities. Notable
exceptions are Cardiff
University (12 high
earners fewer in 2017 than
in 2016) and UCL, which
had 452 high earners
in 2016 but only 391 in
2017.
A College spokesper-
son said: “Our success
depends on attracting
world-class talent and our
remuneration reflects that.
“Our global rivals
recognise the importance
of attracting world-class
leaders – as do we,” they
added.
These figures emerge
amid an ongoing row
regarding proposed
changes to the University
Superannuation Scheme
– the pension scheme
to which most higher
education institutions
belong. Members of the
University and College
Union have been striking
across the country to
protest against restructur-
ing that could see lecturers
and academics lose up to
60% of their final pension.
More than 60% of stu-
dents support the strikes,
according to a YouGov
poll, and more than
115,000 students have
signed petitions calling
for refunds of tuition fees.
King’s College London
has already agreed to
reimburse students using
the money forfeited by
striking staff. Imperial
students have received
guarantees that they will
not be examined on any
content not covered as a
result of the strike.
The pensions dispute
has been exacerbated by
recent stories regarding
high pay received by
vice-chancellors. The
average salary of Russell
Group vice-chancellors is
almost £332,000, rising
to nearly £356,000 when
employer pension con-
tributions are taken into
account. Revelations over
the salary, benefits and
‘golden goodbye’ granted
to outgoing University
of Bath vice-chancellor
Dame Glynis Breakwell
prompted then-uni-
versities minister Jo
Johnson to set out plans
for a “fair remuneration
code” to restore “public
confidence”. The code
includes requirements for
vice-chancellors to recuse
themselves from remuner-
ation committees, disclose
benefits (such as expens-
es), and publish data on
the wage gap between
university chiefs and
academic staff. Details of
staff earning more than
£100,000 would also
have to be published and
salaries over £150,000
would have to be justified.
Failure to adequately
explain high wages could
attract fines from the
Office for Students.

most assessments within
the time-frame, with
93% of items coming
back to students within
ten working days. The
Faculty of Medicine,
which had the fewest
number of assessments,
also had the lowest rate of
returned work, with 80%
of items returned within
the time frame.
Broken down by
department, there rate of
return varied widely: the
worst-performing depart-
ments were Medical Bio-
sciences and Mechanical
Engineering, which had
a rate of return of 33%
and 50% respectively. A
number of departments
were completely compli-
ant with the recommen-
dations, with Physics,
Chemical Engineering,
and Undergraduate
Medicine returning all
assessments within the
time-frame.
However, where feed-
back was late, the reasons
behind the delay were
only communicated to
students in 23% of cases.
Many departments did not
provide any information
to students regarding late
feedback.
The audit, the first
College-wide attempt to
timelines for feedback de-
livery, and communicate
delays to this feedback as
soon as possible. This is
the first academic year the
policy is in effect.
Burstow told Felix: “It
is reassuring to see that
feedback is generally
reaching first year stu-
dents within the stipulated
time-frame, [but] it is
unacceptable that students
are not being told when
and why their feedback
will be late.”
The data for the audit
was provided by ICU’s
Academic Representa-
tives, and was compared
to departmental standards
provided by the College.
Burstow told Felix: “I
would like to offer huge
thank you to all the Aca-
demic Reps who helped;
it would not have been
possible without you."
The audit will be pre-
sented at the College’s
Quality Assurance and
Enhancement Committee
(QAEC) in April.

Strikes, strikes, strikes
Y
ou might not
know, but this
editorial is
the last thing
I write each week, just
before sending the paper
off to print. I’m sure
you couldn't tell. Just
ignore the strange stream
of consciousness, the
random spelling mistakes
(all my copy editors have
gone home), and the
editor-on-the-verge-of-a-
nervous-breakdown style.
Trust me, it’s all fine.
My Deputy Editor
suggested I eschew the
editorial this week, and
explain I was striking in
solidarity with our lectur-
ers and support staff. It’s
a tempting idea, but this
space is really the only
place in the paper where
I can express myself un-
hindered. And at least one
person reads it (hi mum!),
so I thought I’d better do
one this week.
The big news came
along just as we were
winding down for the
week: late this afternoon,
the University and
College Union (UCU)
announced they would
potentially hold another
two weeks of strike
action if the dispute over
pensions isn’t resolved.
They would time this to
affect the examination and
assessment period across
UK universities, in a bid
to get UUK, the universi-
ties governing body, to sit
down and listen.
If this goes ahead, it
will mark a stark shift in
the battle between UCU
and UUK. Whereas the
last couple of weeks have
been quite amicable on
campus, if UUK does not
reach a workable compro-
mise, this new wave of
strikes could turn nasty.
While students have – in
general – been more or
less supportive of the
striking staff (after all, in
the snow last week any
excuse to not head into
uni was very welcome),
things could take a turn for
the worse as examinations
and degree completion are
threatened.
What I would like to
do, if I can, is echo some
of the points that have
been put across by staff
and students over the
past few weeks: firstly,
academics and support
staff aren’t just striking
for the fun of it. These
are a group of people who
really want to get involved
with academia, pass on
their knowledge, and help
students become more
well-rounded, fulfilled
individuals. Most of them
could get much better paid
jobs in the private sector,
but stay on because they
have a real passion for
their jobs. That this strike
action is also difficult for
them should be recog-
nised.
Secondly, the ultimate
end-goal of these strikes
goes beyond individual
examinations. It also,
really, goes further than
staff pensions. If this all
falls apart, could be an
education system that –
in a few short years – is
completely unrecognis-
able; one that is less
fulfilling, less enjoyable,
and of lower quality. As
graduates eschew the
public sector for private
jobs, our universities will
suffer, and the students of
the future will suffer too.
Finally, if you feel
pissed off, then good –
this is what the strikes
are designed to do, and it
is through frustration that
tangible change is often
achieved. Just make sure
your ire is directed to
the right targets. Send an
email to the Provost. Get
your heads of department
to lobby the College. And
give your striking staff a
wave when they’re on the
picket line. It could make
all the difference.
Oh, and #voteICU.
