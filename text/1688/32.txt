O
n the 17th-18th
of February,
I m p e r i a l
College Sailing
Club hosted the Imperial
Icicle, now in its second
year. Spread across
two days and hosted at
Wembley Sailing Club
on Welsh Harp Reservoir,
the event boasted 135
races, two massive socials
and fantastic catering by
Imperial’s French and
Swiss chefs. The Icicle
had a total of 18 teams and
even gained international
recognition with teams
flying in from outside the
UK.
The weekend started
on Friday night: after
the teams had met with
their hosts, they headed
to Wetherspoons to begin
pre-drinking for the house
party boldly hosted by
one of Imperial’s Social
Secretaries. The over 100-
person strong party proved
a resounding success,
with teams thoroughly
enjoying themselves and
staying until the early
hours.
Sadly, for the Imperial
sailors there was little
chance to sleep with most
having to get up at 5:30
AM to start preparations
for the day ahead. The first
capsize of the day came
early with our Bosun,
James McLeod, taking
a refreshing dip next to
the pontoon before sails
had even been hoisted.
Despite this, and with
“The curry
came to an
abrupt end
when an
electrical
fire resulted
in a rapid
evacuation”
remarkable efficiency for
sleep deprived students,
all the boats were rigged,
ready and out on the water
as the first teams trickled
in. All this hard work was
rewarded with a bacon
butty, but sadly no sign of
wind.
After the briefing deliv-
ered by our Race Officer
and former Commodore,
Joe Burgin, the teams
sat down for what they
thought was going to
be long wait. However,
barely an hour afterwards,
Joe decided it was time to
launch and that the wind
was coming in. Despite
accusations that he was
being a fool by the rest
of the race committee, we
went ahead as planned.
Sure enough, as the first
boat launched off the
pontoon, a fair breeze was
beginning to make its way
across the reservoir.
Once the teams were
on the water, the start
boat jumped straight into
sequence with almost
continuous rolling starts.
No mercy was given to
any team that had fallen
asleep and did not turn
up to their boats, a move
jokingly commented
on by Bruce, one of our
umpires, as “brutal”.
Mercy was not shown by
the umpires either who
doled out spins to anyone
breaking rule 42 in the
light winds. Unfortunate-
ly, the day was not without
its challenges, with the
wind coming and going
and regular 90˚ shifts.
Overall, after a long day
of racing, an astounding
60 races were completed
with Edinburgh Blue and
Oxford Blue coming out
on top but with many
races left to sail.
Once everyone was
warm and dry, they
headed back to their hosts’
to prepare for the night
ahead. With everyone in
their Disney costumes,
the sailors ventured to
Drummond Street for a
traditional BYOB curry.
With over 100 in a private
room, the social got off
to a fantastic start even
if many freshers were
left without cutlery.
Unfortunately, the curry
came to an abrupt end
when an electrical fire on
the top floor resulted in
a rapid evacuation and
fire engines called to the
scene. We arrived earlier
than planned at the club,
but the night eventually
picked up and many a
drunk sailor showed off
their enthusiastic moves
on the dance floor.
Much to the dismay of
Imperial’s freshers it was
another early start, once
again getting up at 5:30
AM to rig and launch
all the boats. Despite
everyone being hungover,
due to the leadership of
our Event Organiser and
Commodore, Krystal
Law, the boats were again
prepared for the arrival of
the teams.
After only a short post-
ponement, the wind filled
in and racing commenced.
The first and only boat
breakage of the weekend
happened early in the day
as one of the shackles
came undone on the jib.
Thankfully this happened
whilst still in the start
sequence and the boat
was fixed by our fantastic
umpires in minutes. The
wind, although more con-
sistent than on Saturday,
still proved shifty as
expected on the Harp.
This did not stop the race
committee squeezing in
another 30 races, giving
every team 10 races
each before moving into
leagues.
The teams were split
into Gold, Silver and
Bronze based on their
round robin performance.
This saw some excellent
team racing with some
very evenly matched
teams fighting it out. Our
race officer made the call
to power through all 45
races before the end of the
day. Sadly, due to lack of
time, we were not able to
go into finals. Fortunately,
there was still a clear
winner at the end of the
day. with N.W.A (New
Wessex Alumni, basical-
ly Southampton Uni’s
alumni team). going un-
defeated in Gold league.
The day came to an
end with the winning
teams and umpires being
rewarded with a healthy
quantity of alcohol and
N.W.A., the winners,
a “beautiful” laser cut
trophy crafted in the
Imperial workshops. After
a long weekend, everyone
went home with smiles on
their faces for a well-de-
served night’s sleep.
Overall, the event ran
smoothly with N.W.A
coming in first place in
Gold, Edinburgh Blue in
second and Oxford Blue
in third and a total of
135 races sailed, in very
challenging conditions.
Special thanks must be
given to all the umpires
(Ed Fryer, Bruce Hebbert,
Ruth Owen, Bill Wyatt,
Paul Robson, Andrew
Wishart, Tim Palmer,
Enrica Mameli) who gave
up their weekend for the
event. Also, all of the
team at Imperial, espe-
cially Joe Burgin (Race
Officer), Krystal Law
(Event Organiser) and
James McLeod (Bosun)
who helped ensure the
weekend went off without
a hitch.

L
ast Wednesday,
Imperial took
on the last
LUCA (London
Universities and Colleges
Athletics) race of the
cross-country season,
fielding over 30 runners
and finishing top of the
league for the women and
in 2nd place for the men.
As per usual, the club
met at Beit in the early
afternoon for the tradi-
tional face paint and chit
chat before taking the
tube, this time in direc-
tion of Shepherd’s Bush
as the race was soon to
take place in Wormwood
Scrubs. This was a vital
race as the runners faced
the challenge of keeping
their places on the team
podiums, as the women’s
A team were in 1st
position and had a mere
6 points lead on UCL,
whereas the men’s A team
were in 2nd position and
only 15 points behind
UCL, so the rivalry gave
these feisty runners all the
necessary motivation on
their way to the park.
The course began
near the Linford Christie
athletics track where the
club usually trains with
Thames Valley Harriers,
then entered a wooded
section. Once out of the
woods, runners were to
proceed around the park,
mostly on soft ground or
mud in our case as the
weather hadn’t been kind
the day before, and on
a relatively flat course
overall, before arriving to
the finish line.
After taking a club
picture, the race was
about to start and the
15- women- and 16-men-
strong Imperial team made
its way to the starting line,
determined to finish the
season on a bright note.
As the women ran 2 laps
and the men 3 laps, each
lap 3km long, it gave the
non-competing squad a
chance to cheer on their
team-mates and encour-
age them throughout the
race, and by the looks of
it, it was not in vain.
Overall the whole club
did a great performance
with some impressive
running, as all 5 of Im-
perial’s A team made it
in the top 25, led home
by Oliver Newton in 4th,
Kirill Mikhaylov in 15th,
Fergus Johnson in 19th,
Thomas Bayley in 21st
and Charlie McFadzean in
25th, followed closely by
Matt Douthwaite in 26th.
The women’s race was
also full of smashing per-
formances, as the Imperial
A team dominated the last
race of the season: with
notably Georgia Curry
coming in 2nd place, Kate
Olding in 3rd, Women’s
Captain Anna Lawson
in 4th, Sarah Grover in
6th, Anna Wilson in 17th
and Club Captain Alex
Mundell in 21st, a total
success.
After celebrating
those victories with more
pictures, a top notch
baking degustation and
many congratulations,
it was time for more
celebrations as the end
of the cross-country
season meant that the
league results were to be
announced.
The team then made
its way to the TVH club-
house, where the results
were to be sorted and the
winners declared. This
was the moment we had
been waiting and working
for since the first race at
Parliament Hill, and all
the hard work was finally
about to pay off: overall
the Women’s Team won
the league, with amazing
performances throughout
the season by many of
their finest athletes such
as Sarah Johnson, Kate
Olding, Sarah Grover,
Captain Alex Mundell,
GeorgiaCurryandnatural-
ly Women’s Captain Anna
Lawson, who encouraged
her team all along the
season and led them to
victory, with also some
terrific individual results
as Kate Olding ended 3rd
of the women’s overall
standings, Anna Lawson
in 5th and Sarah Grover
in 7th. Imperial women’s
B and C teams also did
great as they made 5th
and 8th place respectively.
The immense success was
made even sweeter as it
was the first time that the
Imperial women’s team
won the league, what a
dream team.
On the men’s side, the
results were also absolute-
ly amazing: the A team
ended in 2nd position with
a great lead over Brunel
and just 71 points short of
1st place. The season was
filled with equally strong
performances as Oliver
Newton, Harry Scriven,
Henry Hart, Fergus
Johnson, Kirill Mikhay-
lov, Charlie McFadzean,
ChrisThomas, Chris Olley
and Men’s Captain Lewis
Jackson made the men’s
A Team shine all along
the season, with Oliver
Newton finishing in 4th
of the men overall and
Kirill Mikhaylov in 7th
overall. Imperial men’s B
and C teams also did great
as they made 7th and 10th
place respectively.
The celebrations went
on in the evening as
the club had prepared a
joint social with Hockey
at Sway Bar in Covent
Garden to dance the night
away.
All in all, it was the
perfect way to end the
cross-country season and
to celebrate the great
results achieved by the
whole club, after all these
months of hard work that
paid off. What more could
Imperial ask for to begin
the athletics season, with
the first outdoor event on
the 17th of March.
