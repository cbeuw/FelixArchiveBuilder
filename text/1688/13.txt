the rest of the commu-
nity? Normalising the
structure and leaving the
monopoly of the layout
to the lecturers can be
understood for the sake of
simplicity, but when that
initial goal isn’t met, then
Why Blackboard?
“Often, the

B
lackboard. The
main framework
that manages
all the course
material and information
for most departments, and
yet it still remains flawed.
It is currently the prin-
cipal exchange platform
between professors and
their respective students
when it comes to sharing
notes, tutorials, and all
other diversified pieces
of information, but does
it achieve a clear and
structured organisation,
and truly correspond to
the most efficient way to
do so?
From the inconsistency
of its usage between lec-
turers, to the unnecessary
restrictions it poses to
the students, Blackboard
has led to a lot of unsat-
isfied opinions. Often, the
necessary material for a
course is not solely avail-
able on Blackboard, and
yet it is still not possible to
access other knowledge-
able sources, or personal
studying elements,
without having an exces-
sive amount of tabs open,
forcing us to jump back
and forth through our
open pages to recall the
most basic of details. How
is it that a website created
for students in order to
improve their access and
understanding of course
information, doesn’t
actually give us authority
on the outline of material,
and provides only limited
sources of exchange with
of “shared information”
through this interface
should be re-evaluated.
Instead of having an open
and constructive medium
between professors and
students, current Virtual
Learning Environments
(VLEs) such as Black-
board allow no space
for social studying. This
creates difficulty in im-
mediate access to specific
information or particular
answers, leading to yet
another open tab on our
already busy screen to
accommodate for a social
website such as Facebook,
Whatsapp or Google
Drive, with which no
clear systematic scheme
has been set up, making
this whole process all the
more confusing. There
is a noticeable lack of
engagement from the
students and a clearly
limited interaction with
the teachers, which there-
fore means there is no true
sense of co-dependency
or community. We are
essentially constrained to
use a single VLE which
has not been improved for
over 10 years.
The work we are given
is hard enough as it is; the
way to access the neces-
sary material shouldn’t
be an additional source
of stress and concern.
Instead of having an
unclear institution-pro-
vided website, why not
provide the students with
an intuitive system that
allows them to organise
material in the way they
deem best for their work
ethics? We should be able
to share organised pages
of information with one
another and collaborate
as a group. Improving the
user interface and simpli-
fying the layout, giving
it a more innate feel, and
therefore giving both lec-
turers and students more
confidence to interact
with others through this
shared platform and take
part in open discussions
about certain challenging
topics. This new collabo-
rative method could allow
social data processing

The drawbacks of not using online education to its full capacity.
restrictions towards the
students on their own uni-
versity platform probably
should not stand. In ret-
rospect, the mere concept
created by a third year
Mechanical Engineering
student, which aims to
encompass all these new
possibilities, and take into
account various other con-
siderations. It will target
the main issues when it
comes to communication
within the department
and will dedicate a good
part of its functionality
to the simplification of
the layout. Despite being
still in the experimental
phase, this platform has
the potential to perhaps
become a more intuitive,
user-friendly alternative
the Blackboard. Infotree
is currently focusing on
implementing a plug-in
which would allow
students to import data
into their own personal
space in order to facilitate
their access to it. The
feedback.
In the Mechanical
Engineering Department,
there is a website called
Piazza in certain subjects
that acts as an open
tion to reach all students
so the questions are not
asked twice, and allows
follow-up questions if
ever further explaining
is required. The way this
method was implemented
throughout the depart-
ment was by making it
the only option, forcing
lecturers to answer solely
on this platform rather
than to individual emails
from the students. To a
certain extent, this shared
collaborative site allows
everyone to engage with
the material, and be
provided with quick and
simple answers to their
questions. Indirectly, this
also informs the lecturer
about the main topics of
struggle, allowing them
to adapt and shape their
course in order to put
more emphasis on certain
parts, resembling an inter-
active feedback system.
However, just like Black-
board, the main issue
here revolves around the
organisation and layout
of the information, as the
questions are organised in
chronological order rather
transition of information
between Blackboard and
Infotree will be effortless
and quick, and will give
students complete control
over how they would want
to organise it. It builds
upon the current edu-
cational website, whilst
introducing the possibil-
ity for various different
sources, not only for the
eyes of the individual,
but also for the rest of the
course if ever one wishes
to share some of their
material.
As the website is
progressively improved,
it will allow students in
tandem with teachers to
create efficient and com-
prehensive educational
pages that will be passed
down through the years
and constantly reviewed
and improved upon,
based on the feedback of
the users. Over time, our
studies here at Imperial
will become easier for all
incoming students and
allow topics to be explored
more thoroughly and in
depth to give a fuller un-
derstanding of the module
and its application. With
this new form of interface,
the strain on lectures and
Issues within blackboard often lead to lots of tabs being open, which doesn’t help productivity// Wait but why

than grouped together
by relevance to a certain
topic.
There is an emerging
site called “Infotree”,
tutorials is expected to
reduce, allowing the
possibility for a greater
presence of online
learning as its importance
increases, due to the rapid
and inevitable digital-
isation of information.
This surfacing sense of
community will lead to a
sense of mutual aid where
students themselves who
have a deep understand-
ing of a particular subject
could share informational
and demonstrative videos
or lectures to the younger
years.
The principal issues
with Blackboard are
sometimes too present
and crucial to be ignored,
and giving the students
the possibility to control
their workspace in a more
organised manner could
benefit everyone in the
department, ridding us
of a fair amount of un-
necessary effort. Ideally,
a website that acts as “a
plugin where students can
quickly extract and add
content from anywhere to
just one place” could be a
long awaited innovative
change, that will keep on
developing throughout the
years.
