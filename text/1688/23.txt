“Jimmy
Kimmel invited
back for
another year,
hopefully his
last”
I
n the early hours of
the morning, UK
time, another year
in the film industry
came to a close, as Jimmy
Kimmel closed out the 90th
Academy Awards. The
winners headed off to the
after party, cleaners began
sweeping the theatre floor
of discarded acceptance
speeches and candy wrap-
pers, and film enthusiasts
began a two-month period
of hibernation before the
Cannes Film Festival
begins, and we start the
whole shebang again.
The Academy Awards
are, in general, a staid
affair, and this year was
no different. But while
this should perhaps have
been expected, it felt like
a let-down after what
has transpired over the
previous twelve months.
At the last awards
ceremony, Warren Beatty
and Faye Dunaway made
the most meme-able
mistake of their lives,
as they mistakenly an-
nounced La La Land as
the Best Picture winner,
only for it to be revealed as
Moonlight mere minutes
later. At the time, it
seemed like the beginning
of a sea change: here’s a
low-budget, LGBT+ film,
with an all-black cast,
winning out over a barn-
storming celebration of
Los Angeles life – catnip
for the typical Academy
voter.
Moonlight’s win came
after a moderate shake-up
of the Academy’s mem-
bership, which brought
down the average age,
increased diversity, and
made a small step towards
gender parity. In October,
the membership was
shaken even further, as
Harvey Weinstein, the dis-
graced film producer, who
has been accused of sexual
misconduct by more than
80 women, was expelled
from the Academy. Since
then we’ve had the rise of
#MeToo and Time’s Up,
as more and more women
take aim at ingrained
misogyny within the film
industry.
As we approached this
year’s ceremony, there
were signs that things
would be a bit different:
from women wearing
black on the red carpet
in protest, to Casey
Affleck not presenting
the Best Actress award
amid previous sexual
harassment accusations,
things were set for this
to be a different kind of
ceremony.
It wasn’t. Not really.
Instead of an evening
banishing all the old
cobwebs of inequality
clinging onto the industry,
we had several hours of
lip service from presenter
Kimmel (invited back for
another year, hopefully
his last), a few clapbacks
against President Trump’s
xenophobic tendencies,
and a rather predictable
slate of award winners.
Guillermo del Toro’s
The Shape of Water
emerged as the main
winner from the night,
with four awards in the
bag,includingBestPicture
and Best Director. They
were well-deserved: The
Shape of Water is a sump-
tuous romantic fantasy,
conjured up from the
imagination of a director
working at the height of
his powers, which touches
on themes like belonging
and identity.
Compared to the rest
of the films up for Best
Picture – Call Me by
Your Name, a tender gay
coming-of-age drama;
Get Out, Jordan Peele’s
feature debut that sharply
skewers liberal hypocrisy;
and Lady Bird, which
explores the complex
relationship between
mothers and daughters
with thrilling clarity – The
Shape of Water might
seems middle of the road,
but the choice to give it
Best Picture is still quietly
radical. For starters, it’s
a fantasy film, which the
Academy rarely chooses
to endorse, instead prefer-
ring stolid drama. Further-
more, the main leads in
the film are a mute woman
who communicated only
using sign language, a gay
closeted man, and an Afri-
can-American woman – as
diverse a line-up as any of
the other nominees. And
let’s face it: it was either
this or Three Billboards
Outside Ebbing, Missouri,
so we should really just be
grateful.
There were a couple of
surprises thrown into the
mix too: the Best Adapted
Screenplay award went
to James Ivory for Call
Me by Your Name, which
was as expected, but still
a high-point of the night,
particularly when Call Me
by Your Name was shut
out of other categories
where it deserved to win.
Ivory gave a touching
speech paying tribute to
his former partner Ismail
Merchant, who died in
2005, and with whom he
worked in Merchant Ivory
Productions.
Jordan Peele’s win for
Best Original Screenplay
forGetOutwasthebiggest
surprise of the night, as
he became the first black
screenwriter to win in
the category. For Peele
to succeed, particularly
when many (us included)
thought the award would
go to Martin McDonagh’s
Three Billboards, which
handles race topics with
all the grace of a pick-up
truck navigating along a
tightrope, was one of the
stand-outs of an otherwise
boring evening.
Another big break-
through was the win of
Best Foreign Language
Film for Chile’s A Fan-
tastic Woman, which
centres around the expe-
rience of a trans woman
following the death of her
older partner. The film is
driven by the intensity of
lead actor Daniela Vega,
who is herself trans, and
became the first transgen-
der presenter at the Oscars
when she introduced
Sufjan Stevens, perform-
ing ‘Mystery of Love’
alongside Annie Clark

protests, predictable jokes, predictable disappointment
“Frances
McDormand

night with

speech”
and Moses Sumney.
On the whole, however,
the Academy seemed
more prepared to pay
tribute to diversity and
equality in the form of
long montages that said
little, rather than tangible
changes. While Dee Rees’
Mudbound was held up as
a great example of black
women making beautiful
films, it was only nom-
inated for four awards,
and won none. One of
these nominations was
for Rachel Morrison, who
became the first woman
ever to be nominated for
Best Cinematography in
the Academy’s 90-year
history – in and of itself
an embarrassment.
Greta Gerwig’s Lady
Bird went home emp-
ty-handed – a travesty
– while legendary director
Agnès Varda also lost out
for Best Documentary.
The issue here isn’t so
much that Gerwig or
Varda deserved to win in
their categories, but rather,
the eventual winners were
so predictable and safe,
and – in a number of cases
– weren’t actually the best
out of the nominees.
And Kimmel can make
as many jokes about
Harvey Weinstein as he
wants, as the Academy
promises to change, but
nothing can erase the
fact the evening involved
Academy Awards being
given to Kobe Bryant –
accused of sexual assault
in 2003 – and Gary
Oldman – accused of
domestic violence. Donya
Fiorentino, Oldman’s
former wife, who said the
actor choked and beat her
in front of their children,
asked “What happened to
the #MeToo movement?”
It’s a fair question.
In what could have been
a sour end to the evening,
however, Frances Mc-
Dormand, who picked
up the next award for
Best Actress, managed to
salvage the night with a
rousing speech. Coming
up to the podium to
pick up the statue for
her performance as a
grieving mother in Three
Billboards, she promised
us: “I’ve got some things
to say”. She invited all the
female nominees to stand
up – they made up less
than a quarter of the total
nominees, including the
female acting nominees
– and asked the decision
makers in the room to
take meetings with them,
ensuring their stories are
told.
She also left us with two
words on how tangible
change could be achieved:
‘inclusion rider’. It’s a
concept that was explored
in a TED talk by Stacy
Smith in 2016, who said
lead actors and directors
could stipulate in their
contract that the cast and
crew were more repre-
sentative of society at
large. It’s a way they can
use their power within the
studios to push through
much-needed changes.
And it’s this process, more
than any award ceremony,
that can create an industry
in which women and
minorities are able to tell
their stories. This year,
despite the hype about
Gerwig, Rees, and others,
only six women won the
Academy Awards – the
lowest number since
2012. Bringing inclusion
riders into the mainstream
could ensure this is the
last time it’s so low.
