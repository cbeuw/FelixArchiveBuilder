Deterred by Beckett’s infamous motormouth? Not I.
S
amuel Beckett’s
Not I is notoriously
difficult to per-
form. It is a short,
continuous stream of
words from the character
Mouth that loops in and
out of coherence, jumping
between sentences, inter-
spersed with repetition
and interjections.
In 1972, American
actress Jessica Tandy per-
formed it in a New York
premiere. She was told by
Beckett backstage that she
had ‘ruined his play’ – 24
minutes was far too long.
Beckett then decided to
direct it himself, hand-
picking Billie Whitelaw
to play the role. Whitelaw
performed it in 14 and a
half minutes. Later, Irish
actress Lisa Dwan would
become the ‘ultimate mo-
tormouth’, with a record
nine and a half minutes in
her shortest attempt.
Beckett wanted the
play to be performed ‘at
the speed of thought’, and
there was no such thing as
going too fast, as long as
all the words were artic-
ulated. But that is not the
only difficulty. The script
is difficult to learn due
to the lack of a coherent
train of thought – that is
the point, as it is meant to
mimic how a mind thinks.
On top of that, there
are the very specific stage
directions – the performer
has to be suspended off
the ground in the middle
of the stage, and only her
mouth is to be illumi-
nated, hovering exactly
eight feet off the ground.
All other parts of her, and
the stage, has to be pitch
black. She is buckled into
place, unable to move
or see, condemned to
speak as fast as her mouth
would allow. Lisa Dwan
describes the experience
as ‘terrifying’, and ‘every
performance is knife-edge
stuff’.
On the background
of such a demanding
performance, it is incred-
ibly impressive that Jess
Thom, who suffers from
Tourette’s syndrome,
decided to take it on.
Tourette’s is a condition
which causes one to tic,
which means making
movements or saying
things that once cannot
control. For Jess, her most
common tics are saying
‘biscuit’ and thumping
her chest with her fist. For
a play that requires one
to be still and deliver a
speech with precision as
quickly as possible, Not
I seemed, on the outset,
almost impossible for
someone with Tourette’s
to perform.
Despite these difficul-
ties, Jess performs the
role brilliantly (in twelve
minutes as well!), in this
unique production at
Battersea Arts Centre that
reveals Not I in a whole
new light and explores
ideas of reclaiming the-
atre’s voice. In a video
shown after her perfor-
mance that charts the
development of the play,
we see all the innovations
that went into these short
twelve minutes, to make
it suitable for her and to
bring out what she intends.
For example, because
it is dangerous for her to
be strapped into place, a
special wheelchair was
built for her on a platform
that lifts her eight feet off
the ground. Because she
needs to move, instead of
strapping her mouth into
place, she wears a dark
hood that has a built in
light inside that shines on
her mouth.
Jess says that she sees
herself as “disabled”, and
given the nature of Not
I’s text, it seems almost
natural that it should be
performed by a neurodi-
verse population. Rigid
stage directions and
instructions from Beckett
aside, Jess’ modified pro-
duction is important – it
is an act of reclaiming
theatre’s voice for the
representation of all,
including those who have
limitations that appear to
be at odds with artistic
direction, but which,
as exemplified in this
case, actually bring new
meaning to a classic text.
Throughout the perfor-
mance, Jess tics freely,
sometimes saying ‘biscuit’
so rapidly and in succes-
sion that it fits seamlessly
into the pace of the text.
There is a tension when
that happens, the question
hanging in the air: will she
be able to continue? When
Jess first came across
the play, she felt that it
resonated with her – the
isolation of Mouth that is
evident between her bursts
of speech, the alienation
and the apparent chaos of
her thoughts. She identi-
fied with Mouth, which
seemed to parallel the
thoughts running through
her own mind at a time
when her tics were getting
worse. This performance
is thus both personal and
political – an externalisa-
tion of her experiences,
and a political act of
reclaiming theatre’s voice
for the marginalised.
Battersea Arts Centre
is the perfect location: an
old converted town hall,
it has an array of rooms
of different sizes. Not I
uses one of their smaller
rooms, and the audience
sit (and are encouraged
to lie) on cushions on
the floor. It is a relaxed
performance, and BSL
integrated, a feature that
Jess felt strongly about.
Charmaine, her BSL
interpreter, is illuminated
next to Jess during the
performance, and signs
everything she says – in-
cluding the tics!
The production video
and post-show discussion
make the experience
complete, and I felt that
I left with a fuller under-
standing of the play, of
Jess’ motivations, and the
advocacy that is integrat-
ed into the production.
It was a fascinating take
on what is traditionally a
rigid, inflexible and tight-
ly-controlled play – and
its legacy is all the better
for it.
Tourettes hero Jess Thom gives Beckett’s notoriously difficult motormouth in Not I a personal and political spin.
