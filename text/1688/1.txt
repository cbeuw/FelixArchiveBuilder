mperial spends
more on the salaries
of senior staff than
any other Russell
Group university, a
Felix analysis has found.
Vice-chancellor pay at
Imperial is also near the
top of the list.
Data obtained by Felix
reveals that in 2017 Im-
perial spent £5.6 million
on ‘key management’
personnel (KMP) – a
nebulous term that typi-
cally refers to the board
of a university and/or its
senior management staff.
This figure is considerably
more than the next highest
spender: the University of
Southampton, who paid
out £3.7 million.
Imperial has 20 KMPs,
given an average salary
of £280,000 each in
2017. The University of
Manchester was close
behind, paying each of its
eight KMPs an average of
£276,750. The universi-
ties of Leeds and Notting-
ham also have 20 KMPs;
their average salaries are
£166,850 and £155,000
respectively – among
the lowest of all Russell
Group universities.
Imperial’s position as
top spender comes after
a 9% increase from £4.9
million spent in 2016,
giving an average salary
of of £257,895 to the 19
then-KMPs. Imperial is
not the only university that
gave above-inflation pay
rises between 2016 and
2017: the London School
of Economics and the
University of Cambridge
top the list with year-on-
year increases of 26% and
22% respectively.
Seven universities de-
creased their annual KMP
spend. Many of these
were modest cuts but the
University of Warwick
slashed its expenditure by
almost 30% while main-
taining seven KMPs.
Last year’s highest
paid Russell Group
vice-chancellor was
David Eastwood, who
has been at the University
of Birmingham since
2009. Eastwood pocketed
£439,000 in 2017 – a 3%
increase from 2016. Im-
perial and Southampton
were tied at second place,
both paying £433,000.
An Imperial College
spokesperson said:
“The president’s [Alice
Gast’s] pay is set by an
independent remuneration
committee, which is
made up of four external
members of Council. Her
last pay rise was 0.7% – in
line with across-the-board
pay increases for all staff
at the College, which
were weighted in favour
of lower paid staff, as has
happened for the past two
years.”
The lowest paid
vice-chancellors were
those at the University
of Glasgow (a salary
of £279,000) and LSE
(£278,000 pay packet).
Almost all universities
increased their vice-chan-
cellor’s salary, though in-
creases were more modest
compared with the rise
in KMP expenditure; the
greatest vice-chancellor
pay rise went to Stuart
Corbridge at Durham
University, who took
home £302,000 in 2017
compared to £270,000
in 2016 (an increase of
almost 12%). Nottingham
maintained a £381,000
sum as Professor Shearer
West took over the
vice-chancellorship from
