Grumpy Bastard has crossed the line
In previous articles we laughed at his antics. Oh yes we laughed. Ha, ha, ha, we chortled in
rapturous glee. But enough is enough.

ast week Grumpy
Bastard decided
to hate on some-
thing I love. As I
scrolled through all those
words of hatred, I came
upon a sobering realisa-
tion about trendy haters:
you love how they hate
stuff for you while you
just sit on the sidelines
and watch the world burn.
It’s both very convenient
and rather entertaining.
Until they cross the line.
Until they cross the fuck-
ing line.
And no, this isn’t about
a “seemingly important”
topic like worker’s rights,
authoritarian oppression
or any of the other stupid
topics Grumpy Bastard
tends to hate on. This is
something that’s actually
important. This is about
food. Grumpy bastard
hates Huel, which means I
now hate Grumpy Bastard.
I don’t know how it
those lovely lumps of
undisolved powder that
float seemlessly along
your shake? What is the
problem?
While I do understand
that Grumpy Bastard
feeds off the mean
laughs of Royal Family
haters and spicy internet
comments from Mace-
donian nationalists, the
rest of us actually need to
eat. Ok, some people are
pretty organised with their
food. They cook healthy
meals and can get all
their nutrients efficiently
while saving money. And
yes, some other people
can afford to have proper
meals at QTR every day.
But that is not all of us.
When you’re an absolute
mess in terms of food
organising, Huel comes
to save you. When you
can’t afford Fusion every
day, Huel’s £1.60 a meal
comes to save you. When
you’re trying to be a
proper vegan but are just
really shit at cooking,
Huel comes to save you.
When you’re too lazy to
make sandwiches in the
morning, Huel comes to
save you.
I urge Grumpy Bastard
to try it out for a couple
of weeks. Have an open
mind. You might get nasty
farts during the first week,
as has been reported by
some users. But that’s just
your body adjusting to
the fact that you are now
nutritionally complete!
Whenever I have it for
breakfast, my day tends to
be a great day. My mood
will be better thanks to
all those vitamins rushing
through my body. Huel
fills you up and keeps you
healthy. And who knows?
Maybe if Grumpy Bastard
converted to Huel, he
wouldn’t be so grumpy
anymore.
Disclosure: I am not
advertising Huel. Being
a mindless fanboy boy is
just part of the experience.

when next year comes around.

Officers,
If you’re
reading this before the
results drop, good luck. If
they’ve already happened,
congratulations! You’ve
all worked extremely hard
to get here – many of you
had strong opponents, and
even those who didn’t
still took campaigning
seriously. Well done.
I’m writing this because
the Union needs work,
and you’re soon going to
be in a position to change
it. Here are some points
you may want to keep in
mind over the next year.
The first and most im-
portant thing is to not lose
sightofwhyyouarewhere
you are. Don’t forget why
you ran, or who put you
there. We may get a lot
of students voting in our
elections, but it’s not as if
people are really engaged.
That’ll only change if you
reach out, and if you keep
ordinary students in mind
when making important
decisions. extends beyond Level 2
of the Union Building.
You might fall into the
trap of doing a lot of
work yourself, perhaps
alongside the other sabbs
or staff members, but
without really keeping
students in the loop. My
advice would be: involve
us. Students need a real
say in what the Union
does, and nobody elected
any of the staff members.
Though some of them may
claim expertise regarding
the university, they aren’t
the ones who should be
making the decisions. You
are. We are.
You may not realise it,
but it would be easy for
you to overrule staff who
at the moment wield so
much influence. All it’d
take is a little cooperation.
You’re the ones with the
mandate; work together,
involve us in your decision
making, but for the love
of God, don’t let people
with no accountability
tell you what to do.
Finally, you’re more
than just a role descrip-
tion. You may have many
obligations, but you
weren’t elected because
someone read a contract.
You were elected to rep-
resent us. If something
significant happens,
something which affects
students, all of you have
a duty to step forward.
People are counting on
you. Best of luck.
“Don’t lose
sight of why
you are where
you are. Don’t
forget why you
ran, or who put
you there”
It’s easy to get tunnel
vision as a sabb – to
forget the university
“Don’t let
people with no
accountability
tell you what
to do”
