Amazon’s latest purchase – a ‘smart’ doorbell
“Understan-
dably there
were many
concerns
raised about
this service”
R
e c e n t l y ,
Amazon, an
American elec-
troniccommerce
and cloud-computing
company, bought US firm
Ring for more than $1
billion. The firm produces
high-tech doorbells that
records live videos of the
customer’s doorstep and
sends it to their smart-
phone. Ring hopes that
working with Amazon
will allow it to further
develop home security
products. It was founded
in 2012 and has more than
2,000 employees, about
a million customers and
estimated sales of $155
million according to the
Los Angeles Times.
At the end of last year,
Amazon launched a new
service in the U.S. called
Amazon Key, which has
a smartlock and an app
that will allow users to let
package deliveries into
their homes remotely. The
idea behind this was to
remove the need to wait
for couriers that would
deliver anytime between
a set of hours during the
day. It could also be used
to give permanent access
to family members inside
the house, removing the
need to hide a spare key
under a doormat or inside
a potted plant. Installing
the Amazon Key by a
certified provider is free.
If you were to install the
Amazon Key, this is how
a typical delivery would
look: the delivery person
scans a barcode on the
package when they reach
your house. Amazon’s
server then sends you a
notification that a delivery
is about to take place and
simultaneously turns the
camera on. The courier
sends a signal that unlocks
the door, puts the package
inside and sends another
signal to lock the door.
The server then notifies
you about the delivery and
sets up a bank account
with a fake ID, waits for
the day when you are
out and Amazon has a
lot of deliveries, gains
access into your house
and steals your valuables?
This might sound far-
fetched but there have
been instances in the past
where people went the
extra mile to successfully
steal something. Needless
to say, many people are
hesitant about using this
service.
Since then, Amazon
started looking into ways
to ensure the safety and
privacy of its customers
using the Amazon Key,
along with ways to
improve the smartlock
itself. One way is by
buying Ring, which
owned the smart doorbell
technology. The doorbell
takes a live video of
customers’ doorsteps and
sends the videos to their
smartphones. Amazon
hopes that this will help
customers trust their new
service by ensuring the
safety and security of their
homes.
Baird Equity Research
analyst Colin Sebastian
said: “As Amazon moves
are watching a live video
of the delivery instead of
one sent after the delivery
is over.
The downside of this
is that the doorbell only
sends a video of people’s
doorsteps, and not the
inside of the house. While
this ensures that the occu-
pants have privacy within
their house should the
system be hacked, it also
means that the customers
won’t know much about
what is going on just
inside their house during
the time that their door
is opened by the delivery
person. All they would
know is the duration of
the delivery.
Also, in terms of
ensuring security in
homes, the doorbell isn’t
really useful for house
owners with pets. In the
case of pets escaping, the
doorbell can’t take pre-
ventive action against this
event – it would simply
record it and inform the
owner about the event.

“The company
has a long
way to go in
addressing the
concerns of its
customers”
Amazon recently acquired a small firm called Ring in the hopes of raising people’s trust in the Amazon Key service.
“The doorbell
takes a live
video of the
customers’
doorsteps…”
sends you the recorded
video.
Understandably, there
were many concerns
raised about this service.
For starters, what would
happen if you have pets
that were able to run away
when the delivery person
opens the door? What
about planned thievery,
where the delivery person
more aggressively into the
grocery delivery space ...
we believe smart security
devices will be an im-
portant factor in driving
user adoption.” When
smart doorbells are im-
plemented, one advantage
could be that customers
can take action against
the delivery person if the
duration of the delivery is
suspiciously long, as they
Acquiring Ring is a step
in the right direction for
Amazon but the company
still has a long way to go
in addressing the various
concerns of its customers
in an effective manner.
The company will have
to provide evidence that
the Amazon Key won’t
be a tool for malicious
opportunists or planned
thievery before more cus-
tomers can start trusting
and using this service.
Applications of blockchain technology

X
but on the
blockchain”,
has become
as much of a
technological mantra as
“Uber but for X” in these
recent months. Apart
from the sharp peaks and
shallow troughs of the
price of cryptocurrencies
produced by a mutual
belief of value, is there
any practical use of block-
chain technology?
Smart contracts are
being used in blockchains
to allow the execution
of programs, and these
programs run on all partic-
ipating nodes of a block-
chain network. Of course,
implementations of these
smart contracts differ as
different cryptocurrencies
have different purposes.
Ethereum is well known
for using an almost Turing
complete language, only
limited by an individual’s
balance. This wildly free
platform has allowed the
development of several
applications, ranging
from virtual gambling
casinos, crowdfunding
platforms and digital
rights management to
something as superfluous
intact to increase security
and privacy. The one
limitation of this technol-
ogy is the low-bandwidth
connections being used
network as traffic from
the game made up 15% of
transactions at peak times.
Should you be worried
about virtual cats? Cryp-
toKitties has shown us
there are problems with
the current networks in
place; perhaps it wasn’t
the killer application
we wanted, but one we
needed. Current ‘cryp-
to-giants’ need to invest
more in infrastructure
to ensure people who
are getting introduced to
these new ecosystems
have the means to do so.
Apart from the Ethereum
network, there are several
other interesting projects
in the world of block-
chains. Storj uses block-
chains to connect people
who want to rent out drive
space to people who are
willing to lease it, using
end-to-end encryption to
facilitate this. They use
a blockchain to keep a
track of file permissions
and which chunks of
files are where, as they
are never stored fully
the technology allows
a distributed ledger to
exist containing all your
health information shared
between doctors, hospi-
tals and clinics ensuring
no loss of information
as you change health
providers. This is a huge
change from the system
previously in place, where
patients would have to
remember things like all
the different medicine
they have been prescribed
or present hand-written
notes on scrunched up
pieces of paper. MedCoins
would then be able to be
used as payment between
patients and doctors, for
services such as video call
consultations where the
consulting doctor is able
to see all your medical
history, or allow you to
sell your health data to
research companies in
return for MedCoins.
Blockchains have
several utilities; they
allow us to operate
without supervision from
governments or author-
ities, they can be used to
ensure a single correct
account of events is kept
between all parties, and
can execute pre-defined
actions under immutable
terms. The place which
we are at with blockchain
technology is one that
resembles the days of the
early internet, with tech-
nological pioneers already
working on ‘Web 3.0’.
There are many challeng-
es that we are to overcome
before we can utilise this
technology in a meaning-
ful way. Currently there
are a lot of projects out
there that are using the
current popularity trend
in blockchain technology
rather than attempting to
make anything of value.
At the moment you’re
unlikely to be use any
blockchains, however
with the development of
new applications they
may become much more
widespread.
Why you should be wary of tech’s latest buzzword.

“Ethereum is

as CryptoKitties. Cryp-
toKitties allows you to
spend some Ethereum in
exchange for virtual cats,
each of which is unique
and able to be bred and
traded. The popularity of
this game in December of
last year managed to slow
down the entire Ethereum
for peer-to-peer connec-
tions, as maintaining and
building infrastructure for
a large scale distributed
system like this would
prove extremely difficult.
