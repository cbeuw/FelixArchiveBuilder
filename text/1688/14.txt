La Belle Sauvage: Dust after Darkness
Philip Pullman’s first book of his new series The Book of Dust, La Belle Sauvage, continues in the world of His
Dark Materials and is as good as the original.
A
nother year,
another Philip
Pullman series!
Well, not really.
The last world-renowned
series that Pullman
released was His Dark
Materials, and what a
series it was. But that was
all too long ago. Those
familiar with His Dark
Materials might think of
it as the atheist’s take on
Narnia. Those who aren’t
will at least have heard
of it since it is the book
that the feature film The
Golden Compass is based
on.
The first instalment
of his new series, The
Book of Dust, is La Belle
Sauvage - in English,
‘The Beautiful Savage’.
Pullman returns to Lyra’s
world, continuing to
highlight the shady side of
religion in what is a much
darker book.
The story carries us
on a journey where Lyra
– the protagonist of His
Dark Materials – is still
a baby but somehow still
very much the same fierce
personality as she is in the
original series. Pullman
continues in his familiar
fashion of having as the
main characters a young
boy and girl. This time,
it is Malcolm and Alice.
Though they may be
young, the world around
them isn’t.
His Dark Materials
is famous - notorious,
perhaps - for its portrayal
of the Magisterium, a
global religious authority,
as the main antagonists.
In La Belle Sauvage,
Pullman continues to
explore this. Notably, we
learn about ‘The League
of Saint Alexander’,
a group designed to
encourage children to
report heretic behaviour.
Pullman is adamant about
getting his very anti-re-
ligious message across
and is well-practiced at
exploring the authorita-
tive and negative side of
“Pullman
returns to
Lyra’s world,
highlighting
the shady side
of religion in
a much darker
book”
“Gerard
Bonneville is
an evil man,
who brings
a terrifying
darkness to
the book”
organised religion, which
as we know is a heated
theme at present.
For example, it would
be naïve to assume that
most children had no idea
of the current situation
regarding Islamic terror,
or even that they never
questioned the existence
of God. He does perhaps
do this a bit bluntly, and
the allegorical veil often
wears thin. However, this
appears to be his style.
You could be forgiven
for thinking that this
was a children’s book,
but its content is fairly
mature. Violence and
unpleasantness are fairly
commonplace. In one
scene, Pullman even
alludes to the molestation
of a child. Pullman should
be applauded for the way
he balances the mature
and the fantastically
wondrous, the latter of
which makes his writing
so irresistible. Reading
La Belle Sauvage felt
very much like a dream:
nightmarish in parts,
and absurdly glorious in
others. Yet despite that
absurdity, it is very easy
to soak in. There are of
course a few watery bits
here and there. There
are also a lot of passages
which are slightly drawn
out, such as one describ-
ing in detail the way
the trio make their way
through the flood, which
was slightly unnecessary.
La Belle Sauvage in-
troduced some interesting
new characters as well
as gave us a glimpse of
the history of some old
ones (Father Coram!).
Malcolm, who works as
a potboy in his parents’
inn, is a likeable char-
acter from the start. He
is curious without being
nosy and has a strong
moral compass. He is
very down to earth and
takes it upon himself to be
Lyra’s protector. Alice, his
companion, is a pleasantly
resilient young girl. Alice
is the type of girl who
seems to be older than
her years and despite her
ferociousness, she has a
unique personality and a
good heart, ending up as
a very lovable addition to
the characters we know
and love. Then of course
there is the baby Lyra,
who has a personality
of her own. If Malcolm
and Alice were Claus
and Violet Baudelaire
from Lemony Snicket’s
A Series of Unfortunate
Events, then Lyra would
be Sunny - an innocent
yet fierce baby who you
would have no trouble
believing will become the
Lyra of the future.
Finally, there is Gerard
Bonneville. This is an
evil man who brings the
darkness to the book. He
and his terrifying hyena
daemon make for a truly
frightening combination.
The parts where he makes
an appearance were some
of the most interesting and
exciting in the book.
Do not believe for a
second that this book is a
shadow of His Dark Ma-
terials. La Belle Sauvage
is written just as well, and
told in the same gripping
fashion. My only regret
upon its publication is the
wait until the next instal-
ment of the Book of Dust.
But if you can’t bear the
thought of the wait till The
Secret Commonwealth
is released then fret not!
His Dark Materials is due
to be made into a full-
length BBC series later
this year. Here’s to many
more years of Pullman’s
beautiful fantasy.

LA BELLE SAUVAGE
by Philip Pullman
Are we living under the tyranny of science?
Maybe we all need to take some time to re-evaluate our basic relationship with science.
I
’ve noticed posters
around college,
and have been
leafleted with a
manifesto. At first, I was a
little taken aback by their
stance: ‘We believe the
scientific method is dog-
matic and prescriptive,
and it restricts creativity
of thought in science.’The
group, calling themselves
the ‘Against Method
Collective’, seems to have
based their campaign (or
so-called revolution) on
the writings of the rather
maverick philosopher of
science Paul Feyerabend.
Interested, I thought I’d
take a look.
In their materials they
mention a text called
Against Method from
1975 which I picked
up from the library but,
honestly, found a little
too dense for someone
not versed in reading
philosophy. However, I
did find another book by
Feyerabend, based on a
series of public lectures
he gave in 1992 at the
end of his life, called The
Tyranny of Science: it’s
transformed the way I
think about science.
“Yeah, it’s time
for a big pull-
quote. We love
these things,
but don’t
forget to make
them short!”
Feyerabend is more
than just a dry critical
thinker, he is a masterful
storyteller. His voice is
strong and often makes
the reader (or this reader,
at least) gasp, laugh, and
screw up their face in
displeasure. His provoc-
ative thoughts are most
challenging to those of
us who have been fully
indoctrinated with the
‘scientific’ view of the
world — many of us at
Imperial for sure!
But this is exactly what
he is trying to do: enrage
us and wake us up from
our complacency.
Feyerabend wants us to
realise the fallacy in our
own scientific thinking.
He wants us scientists
to remember that we
are humans and cannot
remove ourselves (and
all other influences) from
science. He wants us to
realisethatbyignoringthis
we are fooling ourselves,
but, more importantly, he
argues that our blinkered
way of thinking would
limit what we could learn.
He starts, like most
philosophers, with the
Ancient Greeks and
then charts the rise of
rationalism through to our
modern world, in which
the mystical ‘scientific’
world view rules supreme.
He argues that some of the
very basic assumptions
we all make about science
are false and that sustain-
able parts of scientific
ideology were created on
the basis of superficial
generalisations. He argues
that this has led us all to
absurd misconceptions
about the nature of human
life.
He pleads for us to
understand that knowl-
edge is obtainable by
any method, and by
understanding this we
could relinquish science’s
hold over all truth, thus
coming out from under
its tyranny and solve the
real problems people face:
hunger, poverty, and war.
To Feyerabend, the
sciences themselves are
not the enemy. They
play their part in the real
solutions. Feyerabend
thought the problem
lies in the scientific
method: scientists are
taught to be ‘objective’,
approaching the world as
an abstraction instead of
experiencing the world
by other methods. Science
encourages us to theorise
and dehumanise people,
turning us into data or
objects to model. This,
for Feyerabend, is the true
tyranny of science.
But why should we
read Feyerabend now?
Science, now more than
ever, seems to be under
threat and has started to
fight back. We have seen
presidents dismissing
climate change, politi-
cians saying that we ‘have
had enough of experts’,
and schools teaching cre-
ationism.
People have had
enough of science and
its absoluteness, its hard
inhumanness, and its
‘objectivity’. In response,
science has entrenched
itself. Instead of opening
itself up to examination
and accepting its flawed
nature, the scientific
establishment poo-pooed
non-believers as stupid
and ignorant.
This sentiment was
most evident in April
2017, when those devoted
to science attended the
worldwide political march
for science with placards
that read slogans such as
‘Science reveals reality’,
‘Science has no agenda’ ,
and ‘Without science it’s
just fiction’. Here, scien-
tists were saying that the
only way to knowledge is
through science: science
is the only truth. Thanks to
Feyerabend, I can see that
not only are these state-
ments too naive about the
nature of science, but also
that they are dogmatic and
oppressive. No wonder
we haven’t convinced
anyone to come join our
evidence-based, peer-re-
viewed, rational cult.
Maybe scientists
should all read Feyera-
bend, learn to be a little
less self-righteous, and
open their minds to new
ways of thinking. Instead
of oppressing ourselves
and others with science,
we should maybe take
note of what Feyerabend
said all those years ago
and replace the scientific
method with the principle
that ‘anything goes’.
