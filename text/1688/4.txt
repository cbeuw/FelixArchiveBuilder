A survey, carried out
over the last couple of
months, found 88%
of staff and students
surveyed were not in
favour of a cashless
system

mperial College
London will contin-
ue to use cashless
payment across
eight of its catering
outlets, despite overall
negative feedback on
the changes.
In a survey carried out
between December 2017
and February 2018, 88%
of students and staff who
responded were not in
favour of expanding to
a fully cashless system.
T
he shortlist for
this year’s Stu-
dent Academic
Choice Awards
(SACAs) has been re-
vealed.
48 staff from across a
number of departments
are shortlisted for eight
awards, including Best
Teaching for Undergrad-
uates, Best Support Staff,
and Best Supervision.
Student Academic Choice Awards shortlist revealed
This year 935 staff
members were nominated,
with 1,868 nominations
submitted in total – the
highest number since the
SACAs began in 2013.
Nick Burstow, Deputy
President (Education),
who is one of the leads for
SACAs organisation, told
Felix: “Our Academic and
Wellbeing Representa-
tives did a fantastic job
sifting through the huge
number of nominations
to whittle it down to these
final few.”
A number of nominees
have previously been
recognised in the SACAs:
Dr Steve Cook, from
the Department of Life
Science, for example, has
been nominated for Best
Tutoring this year, having
been awarded Best Teach-
ing for Undergraduates in
2015.
Giskin Day, a course
lead for the Imperial
Horizons programme, and
course director for the in-
tercalated BSc in Medical
Science with Humanities,
Philosophy & Law, has
been nominated for the
Best Innovation award.
It awards staff who have
made use of “imaginative
use of technology” and
“early adoption of new
methods”.
Day told Felix she was
“absolutely delighted” by
the nomination: “Student
appreciation really boosts
the morale of teachers
who care about the ed-
ucation experience. It is
heartening to see that, in
these days of high fees,
students don't view edu-
cation merely as a service
transaction but as some-
thing worth expressing
gratitude for. It certainly
makes the effort we put
into teaching feel very
worthwhile.”
Burstow said “it was a
pleasure to read through
the nominations and see
just how much of a posi-
tive impact Imperial staff
have had on students. It
was incredibly difficult
choosing just six shortlist-
ees per category, and even
harder picking a winner.”
The shortlisted can-
didates are invited to
the prize ceremony on
Monday 14th
May, where
the winners will be re-
vealed.
Respondents frequently
raised concerns about a
cashless system not offer-
ing enough choice about
how to pay, leading to
charges on card transac-
tions for some customers,
and being less convenient.
The College, after
reviewing the feedback
“very carefully”, said they
would not roll out a fully
cashless service to all
catering outlets, but “the
outlets involved in the
trial will remain cashless
as standard”, with the
exception of the Senior
Common Room and
H-Bar Cafe, which will
operate a single cash-only
till at peak times.
Theodor Videnberg, a
postgraduate student who
has previously written
in Felix criticising the
switch, said:
“Is it disappointing to
see that although 88% of
respondents are against
fully cashless operations,
the college has decided
to ignore the complains
and ban cash from the
majority of its outlets. In
the remaining two outlets
cash will be accepted only
at peak times, thus severe-
ly restricting our freedom
of payment choice. With
this undemocratic deci-
sion, the college shows
that is does not care about
student/ staff opinion and
concerns on this issue.”
College initially ran
the trial for two weeks
at the end of December,
across four outlets, before
extending it to eight
outlets for the next two
months. They said the
change would “improve
your experience by re-
ducing queuing times and
creating a faster service”.
Results from the survey
showed staff and students
“felt that queue times
have not visibly reduced.”
In a statement for Felix,
a College representative
said: “As part of the cash-
less trial at our catering
outlets, we received 50
feedback responses from
students and staff. 88% of
these were not in favour
of the College’s catering
outlets going fully cash-
less. We have listened to
your feedback, and a fully
cashless service will not
be rolled out across all
outlets.”
In total six outlets will
continue to operate cash-
less payment only: Fuel,
Queen’s Tower Rooms,
SCR Cafe, Electrical
Engineering Cafe, College
Cafe, and the Business
School Cafe.
Students and staff will
be able to pay via Yoyo,
contactless, and chip and
pin.

T
he Hackspace at
10 Princes Gar-
dens will shut
this Monday,
following “departmental
changes”.
The Hackspace, which
is mainly used by students
to produce prototypes,
will close on Monday 12th
March. Imperial College
Advanced Hackspace
(ICAH), who operate the
space, say the change is
the result of their host – the
Dyson School of Design
Engineering – moving out
of the building.
I
mperial College
London have ap-
pointed Professor
Ian Walmsley FRS
as the new Provost.
Professor Walmsley
joins Imperial from the
University of Oxford,
where he is the Hooke
Professor of Experimental
Physics and the current
Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Re-
search and Innovation).
Professor Walmsley
graduated from Imperial
New Provost named as
Prof. Ian Walmsley
with a first-class honours
degree in physics. In 2012
he was elected a Fellow
of the Royal Society. He
is well known within
the physics world for his
contributions to quantum
optics and ultrafast optics.
Professor Walmsley
is also known for his
involvement in collabo-
rations within academia.
He leader the Networked
Quantum Information
Technologies Hub – one
of four hubs in the UK
National Quantum Tech-
nology Programme, a
£270 million investment
by the UK government
to establish a quantum
technology industry in the
UK. He was also involved
in the creation of the £100
million Rosalind Franklin
Institute, which aims to
“develop new techniques
and instrumentation and
apply them to key chal-
lenges in the health and
life sciences”.
Professor Walmsley
said he was “delighted to
return to Imperial”, and he
was “look[ing] forward to
working with colleagues
to continue the trajec-
tory of world-leading
research…for which the
College is renowned.”
Professor Alice Gast,
Imperial’s President, said
in an email to students:
“Ian will be a great asset
to the College, and I look
forward to working with
him.”
Professor Walmsley
will replace Professor
James Stirling, the current
Provost, on 1st September
2018.
In the email, ICAH
said: “During the opening
of the Invention Rooms
in White City we were
adamant that we will
not be closing the space
in 10 Princes Gardens,
and at the time this was
our intention. However,
we were made aware of
certain changes earlier
this week that make it
impossible to continue to
keep the space.”
They recommend
student use the new Hack-
space in the Invention
Rooms on the White City
campus,whichopenedlast
year. From 12th
March, the
Hackspace at the Inven-
tion Rooms will extend
their opening hours, to
10am - 11pm. ICAH say
this “is something the
community have been
asking for consistently
over the last few years.”
While the Hackspace
‘node’ in Princes Gardens
is closing, ICAH say
they will be opening a
new ‘node’ at the Dyson
School of Design Engi-
neering’s workshops in
ACE150
The move was de-
scribed as “disappointing”
by some students. One
user of the hack-space, a
final year student from the
Faculty of Natural Scienc-
es, told Felix: “This is
very disappointing news.
While I think opening
the White City space for
longer is a good thing,
the fact remains that
closing the space will be
very inconvenient: many
people will go to the space
to start printing, and then
return several hours later
when it’s done. This won’t
be possible if we’ve got to
travel to White City.”
“The Hackspace is
incredibly important for
a number of students,
not only those from the
Design Engineering
course, but across differ-
ent departments. This will
have a direct effect on
the work of students who
regularly use the space.”
In a statement, ICAH
said “We are committed
to making the Advanced
Hackspace the best
network of spaces in the
world designed to turn
ideas into a reality. With
our new spaces coming
online both at South
Kensington and White
City we have dramatically
increased the scope of
what we can offer our
users.”
The Hackspace at 10
Princes Gardens is part
of the Imperial College
Advanced Hackspace
(ICAH), which provides
a network of facilities
across South Kensington
and White City. The
space offers students the
opportunity to use 3D
printing techniques and
laser cutting, to “quickly
prototype small builds and
projects.”
The Invention Rooms
on the White City campus,
which opened last
October, is the latest space
to play host to the ICAH.

A number of
students have raised
concerns over the
high temperatures in
Central Library, which
is undergoing climate
control tests
S
tudents have
been reporting
excessively high
temperatures at
Central Library over the
past week.
Throughout last
weekend, and the begin-
ning of this week, students
havebeenreportingexces-
sively high temperatures,
despite the new climate
control systems that were
installed last year.
In a series of tweets
at the beginning of this
week, Imperial Library
apologised for the high
temperatures. They said
the temperatures were
caused by “the final testing
of the new climate control
system”, and they were
“working with contractors
and estates to rectify [the
temperatures] as soon as
possible”.
In a statement, library
staff said “these tests are
expected to continue until
Friday 16th
March. Library
staff apologise and thank
you for your patience
during these works.”
Students told Felix the
heat over the weekend
was excessive: one
student told Felix “on
Sunday afternoon the heat
was almost unbearable”,
while another said he was
“worried I might have had
a fever”.
Levels 4 and 5 of
Central Library were
closed throughout summer
2017 and the beginning
of the last academic year,
as redevelopment work
was completed. The main
aim of the project was to
improve the cooling and
ventilation systems, with
temperature control being
one of the largest sources
complaints from students.
Works will continue
across Levels 2 & 3 next
summer, with the total
cost reported to be £11
million.
