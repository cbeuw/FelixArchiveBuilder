How can we fix Imperial’s inequality?
Measures such as the ones taken by LSE, Kings and Oxford are a step in the right direction for
fixing the problem.

nequality between
students from low
and high income
backgrounds is a
big problem in many
universities, especially
Imperial. Data published
by UCAS last year re-
vealed that Imperial is
top in student inequality
in the UK, just ahead of
Oxford and 8 places
ahead of Cambridge. At
Imperial, students from
high income backgrounds
are 11 times more likely
to be accepted. These
findings should serve as
a wake-up call. There is
a clear issue and we now
must address it. Firstly,
why is inequality such a
big issue at Imperial? And
more importantly, how
can we solve it?
Perhaps the issue is in
Imperial’s location. Being
based in the most expen-
sive city in the UK and an
expensive neighbourhood
within it could be a barrier
for students from lower
income families. Perhaps
moving part of the campus
in less central areas of
London where living is
more affordable would
improve the situation.
However, the issue is
not only in Imperial’s
location as inequalities are
seen in many universities,
especially those that are
high in rankings. In 2014,
only 23% of state school
students went into uni-
versities ranked in the top
third compared with 65%
from private schools. This
could be due to high ad-
mission grades. Imperial
requires a high A level
performance like other
high ranking universities.
Students from lower
income backgrounds are
less likely to achieve these
grades simply because
state schools invested
less in performance.
This means that bright
students, despite having
the same capabilities, do
worse in exams simply
because they attended a
school in a different area.
Shockingly, this can be
realised by a ‘state school
penalty’, in order to have
the same chances of
getting into high ranking
universities, students have
to get one grade higher in
their A levels. So, even if
disadvantaged students
get the same results,
they are less likely to be
accepted. This problem is
not unique to high ranking
universities. In the UK,
students from more dis-
advantaged backgrounds
are twice less likely to
get into university. Does
this reflect a problem in
England’s application
system then? It could be
that admissions teams
have some implicit bias
against students coming
from more disadvantaged
areas? In 2006, David
Cameron suggested
adopting name blind
applications to deal with
the problem and some
universities have started
to try it out.
Universities are aware
of the problem and trying
to tackle it. Some have
made big improvements
but progress is much
slower in top ranking uni-
versities, such as Imperial.
We should look at univer-
sities such as LSE who
have started training the
admissions team against
implicit bias. Kings have
started giving offers with
lower grades to disad-
vantaged students to help
them get accepted. Some
colleges at Oxford have
also created a foundation
year for disadvantaged
students who have grades
slightly lower than the
required ones. Perhaps the
reason Imperial came out
as number 1 most unequal
is that we just don’t do
enough to help disadvan-
taged students. Why did
we turn down the proposal
of a working class
liberation officer? Why
are we not also pushing
innovative schemes which
address the issue?
However, we can’t
be too harsh. Imperial
does have activities to
involve stimulate interest
in STEM subjects at state
schools as well as an in-
credibly generous bursary
scheme and scholarships.
Also, we must not forget
Imperial is one of the only
universities in the UK
willing to act as a guaran-
tor for students who need
it. Imperial’s shameful
statistics highlight a
more support. Also,
students from more dis-
advantaged backgrounds
face different challenges
so perhaps university is
not a priority, especially
when they receive no help
through the difficult ap-
plication process. So even
motivation wise (without
considering the more
technical aspects con-
sidered before) students
from lower income
backgrounds apply to uni-
versity less irrespective of
their capabilities. Finally,
the problem doesn’t end
once the students get into
university. Students from
lower incomes are more
likely to drop out of their
courses too.
Options like thinking
about campus location
and changing the appli-
cation process are great
and are a step in the right
direction. However, I
believe we should also
tackle the real root of
the problem. We should
motivate low income
students by showing them
university is definitely
an option for them and
helping make applying
less daunting to them. An
excellent example of this
are organisations which
aim to reach out to bright,
low income students to
help them with applica-
tions. Such an organisa-
tion is Project Access, has
actually set up a branch in
Imperial this year. Their
aim is to recruit Imperial
students as mentors
to help disadvantaged
students apply. This I
think is a great approach
to the problem. Students
can help students! By
becoming mentors, or
simply supporting the
cause, our experience of
getting into university
could help decrease ine-
qualities.

bigger issue.
The huge gap has
deep roots. Even if they
do achieve the grades,
students from low income
backgrounds are simply
less likely to apply. This
could simply be because
low income students are
brought up with different
expectations. Children
from wealthier families
are often expected to go
to university. But for a
child from a different
background, for example,
whose parents didn’t go to
university and was never
expected to go himself,
it makes sense that he
is less likely to apply.

L
ast week’s com-
ment article ‘In
the Whites’ (re-
garding Imperial
Musical Theatre Society’s
production of Lin-Manuel
Miranda’s In the Heights)
reignited the old argument
of ‘whitewashing’ works
intended to feature or
represent non-white or
‘marginalised’ groups:
a relevant and worthy
one, certainly, and one
we shall be having for
years, though one I will
not indulge in here. The
article did, however, end
with a poignant question:
“If [MTSoc] knew that
they would not be able to
give the majority of roles
to Latino students, why
attempt to put on a musi-
cal about Latinos?”
Both Miranda and Quiara
Hudes (author of the
musical’s book) have
previously accepted – and
in fact encouraged – edu-
cational productions that
included cast members
“of all stripes”. Why, then,
should a group of talented
young performers who
clearly love, respect, and
admire the material be
prevented from undertak-
ing such a venture by the
colour of their skin or the
language of origin of their
surname? If the produc-
tion were professionally
staged with auditions open
across the country (or
beyond), then the restric-
tions and concerns would
be welcome. But this is a
different ballgame. As a
cast member mentioned,
MTSoc’s demographic is
a representation of that of
a large London university.
What MTSoc has done
is pull off a difficult,
beautiful production of
a musical that celebrates
Latino culture with the
team that it has, regardless
of colour or ethnicity.
The author of ‘In the
Whites’ described a lack
of Latinos in the cast or
directorial team, appar-
ently missing the white
redhead Chilean playing
Carla, or the Nicaragu-
an-American conductor of
the production (and author
of the present rebuttal). At
no point during the entire
production was any part
of Latin American culture
treated with anything less
than the utmost respect
and love. Perhaps the
production was uncom-
fortable for some viewers,
including the author of
‘In the Whites’, but for
almost everyone – includ-
ing this Latino – it was a
welcome celebration of a
beautifully diverse group
of people, one not limited
to a preconceived idea
of skin colour, linguistic
capability/accent, or
even national identity.
Moreover, In the Heights
is a close examination
of issues like identity,
gentrification, inequality,
racism, poverty, alcohol-
the Whites’ missed, most
of all, is the exposure to
the grounded, real-world
Latin-American experi-
ence that, unlike other
shows, Miranda’s musical
provides. Most of all, it
blatantly ignored the hard
work and talent of a top-
notch cast and crew who
worked ungodly hours
to bring this production
to life. Of all the lessons
In the Heights offers,
perhaps none is more
relevant and powerful than
its unabashed alabanza of
community. What event
could give the participants
and viewers a better
chance to learn about one,
and of the nuances of its
culture, than by staging
one of the finest musicals

ism, just to name a few.
These are issues which
affect people of all gener-
ations, races, and origins,
even when the visuals do
not match the ethnicity of
the characters.
The performers on
stage did not wear ethnic-
ity like a skin or disguise.
They embodied three-di-
mensional characters as
best as they could, in their
own skins and voices
(beyond a little makeup
to age one character
fifty years). None of the
rappers rapped in accents
that weren’t their own.
At no point was anything
done with the idea of
caricature, mockery, or
stereotyping. What ‘In
“Should
an under-
represented
community
not welcome a
celebration of
its culture?”
of the early 21st
century by
one of that community’s
greatest spokespersons?
If that makes anyone
uncomfortable, then
maybe they should spend
more time engaging with
people in the community
they seek to defend and
less time with their heads
buried in academic sand.
The world, after all, is
out there, not in a journal
article.
In response to this
question, may I pose
another: Should a com-
munity (such as Latinos)
under-represented outside
of its region of origin
(or, as the author of the
article called it, ‘margin-
alised’) not welcome a
celebration of its culture?
