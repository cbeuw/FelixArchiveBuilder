Strikes set to hit exam period if talks over pensions
aren't resolved
NEWS
UCU members will
strike over the exam
period if the dispute
with UUK is not
resolved.

U
niversity Col-
lege Union
(UCU) has
s a n c t i o n e d
another 14 days of strike
action during exam and
assessment periods if
the current dispute with
Universities UK (UUK)
is not resolved.
The news comes as the
third week of strike action
comes to an end, with
academic and support
staff across the country
walking out from Monday
to Thursday. The strikes
are scheduled to continue
throughout all of next
week.
UCUhavebeenmeeting
with UUK this week, with
the conciliation service
Acas as a mediator, to
discuss a solution to the
current pensions dispute.
UUK, the governing body
for UK higher education
institutions, wants to
put through a number
of changes to the USS
pension scheme. UUK
claim that a £7.5 billion
deficit means the changes
are needed, a position
UCU disputes. UCU say
the changes could mean
members of the scheme
– which includes both ac-
ademic and support staff
– lose up to £10,000 per
year in pension payments.
While UCU had orig-
inally scheduled 14 days
of strikes in escalating
waves, they say further
action may be warranted
“in defence of our pen-
sions”. 65 higher educa-
tion institutions would
face further strike action,
which would take place
between April and June.
UCU have not specified
dates for the strikes, but
say they would “gather in-
formation on when the 14
days of action would be
most effective at different
universities.”
Sally Hunt, general
secretary of the UCU,
said: “I want to stress
that I consider all this
a necessary precaution
against the failure of talks
to deliver an acceptable
settlement. The union
would prefer dialogue and
I have given my personal
commitment to Acas that
UCU is serious about
reaching an agreement.”
weeks ago, and the email
shows “the Provost and
Vice-Provost for Educa-
tion [sic] have apparently
no idea how examinations
at Imperial work.”
Inastatementpublished
earlier this week, Profes-
sor Stirling and Professor
Alice Gast, President, said
they “recognise and regret
the impact that the current
UCU strike is having on
teaching… [senior staff]
have been working with
Department representa-
tives to advise on the de-
velopment of local plans
to minimise the impact on
our students’ education.
This work will of course
continue.”
Last week the College
changed their position on
the UUK valuation of the
USS deficit, calling for the
convening of an expert
group by UUK and USS to
reassess the deficit. They
said assembling the group
may push them past the
deadline for changes to be
made, but they would stay
in the current scheme until
the work is completed.
In the update to staff,
Prof. Stirling and Prof.
Gast said they had met
with Richard Craster
from the Department of
Mathematics, to discuss
“how best to take forward
our call for UUK and the
USS to convene an expert
group, including univer-
sity academics, to look
closely at the valuation
work, and be fully open
and transparent about
what they find.”
In a statement, Dr
Michael McGarvey, Pres-
ident of Imperial UCU,
said: “after nine days of
strikes, and despite the
weather, the UCU picket
lines were just as strong
and the members just as
determined as they were
on day one. The branch
at Imperial continues to
grow rapidly, now up
36% since the dispute
started. While the recent
moves by senior leaders at
Imperial – as well as those
elsewhere – are welcome,
if they are genuine in
wanting to have a fair
agreement on pensions
then they have to make
sure UUK changes its
hard-line position.”
“The current Acas talks
between UCU and UUK
continue, and UCU’s
commitment to a nego-
tiated solution remains
undimmed. So far,
however, there has been
no agreement at Acas.”
Professor Tom Pike,
Imperial UCU’s local
Vice-President, said the
strike action was “unprec-
edented”. He told Felix:
“What has been crystal-
lised from this action is a
much broader recognition
that the balance between
the academic and finan-
cial interests of Imperial,
with the latter expected
to serve the former, has
been completely reversed.
Senior management have
admitted as much, that
Imperial’s support of
UUK to move entirely
to a defined contribution
pension scheme repre-
sented shifting the risk
from Imperial's balance
sheet to individual staff.”
“At this point we don’t
know whether the current
talks at ACAS are leading
to an agreement. We do
know that staff at Impe-
rial will never see senior
management here in quite
the same light. The next
item on the agenda, after
the defence of pensions
has been completed, is a
closing not of any sug-
gested pension deficit, but
rather the yawning dem-
ocratic deficit which has
opened wide at Imperial.”
Imperial is one of a
number of universities
who have broken with
UUK’s stance: earlier this
week the University of
Oxford announced they
would reconsider their
position. The move comes
following a meeting of
staff on Tuesday – known
as a congregation – in
which a debate over the
changes was blocked.
Hundreds of staff then left
the venue, and organised
a separate vote on a reso-
lution to change Oxford’s
position, which passed
442 votes to two.
Louise Richardson,
Oxford’s vice-chancellor,
said: “In light of the depth
of feeling of so many col-
leagues we will convene
a special meeting of
council… and will be rec-
ommending that council
reverses its response to
the UUK survey in line
with congregation’s reso-
lution.”
Cambridge, Man-
chester, St Andrews, and
Warwick universities have
all also moved away from
the UUK position.

“UCU have
sanctioned
another 14
days of strike
action during
exam season if
talks fail”
How the strikes will
affect examinations has
been a concern for both
students and staff. Last
month, Professor James
Stirling, Provost, and Pro-
fessor Simone Buitendijk,
Vice-Provost (Education),
said “no students would be
placed at a disadvantage
due to the strike” and they
would “not be examined
on any material that you
have not been taught.” It
is, as of yet, unclear how
the College will define
missed content.
However, this promise
has been disputed by
some staff. A number of
students in the Depart-
ment of Computing, for
example, have been told

Students raise concerns over organisation of this year's
Leadership Elections

Students have had
complaints about
o r g a n i s a t i o n ,
communication, and
enforcement of rules.
Fred Fyles
Editor-in-Chief
A
number of
students have
criticised Im-
perial College
Union (ICU) for poor
planning and execution
of this year’s Leadership
Elections, which finish
today.
Students have high-
lighted problems with
communication, organisa-
tion, and enforcement of
campaign rules.
During the past week, a
number of candidates and
students have voiced their
concern over students
breaching election cam-
paign rules. Candidates
running for positions in
Machine Learning Society
and Finance Society have
been accused of breaching
election rules by making
use of existing mailing
lists and unsolicited com-
munications.
While students raised
complaints to the Deputy
Returning Officers
(DROs), many felt their
complaints had not been
dealt with properly. One
student told Felix: “The
complaints process is
not transparent at all…
complainants aren’t
updated about how their
complaints have been
dealt with – and if they
are, they are only told that
complaints are ‘handled’.
I find it absurd how there
are candidates with clear
bribery on their manifesto
who have not been dis-
qualified.”
Earlier this week,
however, seven candidates
were disqualified from the
Leadership Elections in
response to “persistent
breaking of rules and
acting against [ICU’s]
values despite warnings
from the [DROs]”. They
said the students had
broken rules by coercing
voters, campaigning in
languages other than
English without a transla-
tion, and use of pre-exist-
ing mailing lists.”
In a statement for Felix,
a Union spokesperson
said: “We’ve had about
the expected number
of complaints this year
and the DROs have
been dealing with them
swiftly and effectively;
candidates should bear
in mind that this is not
always visible from the
outside. The vast majority
of offending candidates
receive one warning and
don’t reoffend.”
Outside of these com-
plaints, students have also
cited problems with the
general organisation of
the Leadership Elections.
Candidates who spoke to
Felix said there was a lack
of clarity from ICU over
the timing and details of
events, and responses to
emails were poor.
One candidate, speak-
ing to Felix, said the
elections this year were
“disappointing”: “As a
candidate, I have time and
time again been left in the
dark about many aspects
of the election process,
most notably the election
debate, which seems to
have been totally forgot-
ten until the last moment –
totally inexcusable when
Meet the Candidates has
been a feature of all recent
spring elections.”
“The Union needs
to have a good hard
look at itself and decide
whether it truly believes
in democracy or just in
window-dressing popu-
larity contests. I for one
hope that it chooses the
former.”
Criticism was also di-
rected against ICU’s live
debate, which aired earlier
this week.
On Wednesday, 7th
March, ICU organised
their “Debate Lives-
tream”, at which candi-
dates for major positions
were asked about their
plans if elected. Out of the
eight positions advertised
as being included in the
debate, only four sessions
were able to go ahead,
after a number of candi-
dates did not attend. In
total, out of 30 potential
candidates, only six at-
tended.
the candidates after thirty
seconds, leaving no time
to actually hear useful
content.
In response, a repre-
sentative of ICU said:
“Please note we have not
addressed any criticism
directed at the Union,
but only corrected factual
errors such as Board deci-
sions and the bars having
professional managers.”
The debate, which in
previous years has been
organised by Imperial
College TV (ICTV), was
organised internally by
ICU, after ICTV pulled
out of the show, saying
they “were unable to
receive the required
timely support needed
from the Union to do the
broadcast.”
In a statement for Felix,
a Union spokesperson
said: “We know there have
been mixed reviews of the
new elections timetable
this year, with a small
percentage of candidates
viewing it negatively; we
have consistently received
requests from candidates
to shorten the timetable in
previous years and we’re
pleased to have put this
new model to the test.”
“Separately, several
candidates were under-
standably unhappy at
communication regarding
the Live Debates, which
we have fully accepted
and acknowledged di-
rectly to candidates and
student societies.”
“We’re happy to
receive feedback from all
members on the elections,
and we’ll be surveying
all candidates about their
experiences as well.
Overall, we’re pleased to
have once again delivered
a nation-leading election
turnout and engaged
more candidates and
student groups than any
other student election in
history.”
“One
candidate
said he had
been 'left in
the dark' over
many aspects
of the election”
Students questioned
the timing of the debate.
Kelvin Zhang, a first-
year computing student,
told Felix the debate was
“very poorly organised”:
“if you check the voting
proportions for last year’s
elections, you’ll see that
more than 2/3 of those
who could vote at this
point had already done
so. Most people who will
vote have already voted.
It’s completely ridiculous
that a debate is being or-
ganised almost at the end
of elections.”
Other students also
raised criticism of the
moderation of the debate,
particularly when the
moderator responded to
claims about ICU and
cut candidates off after
a 30-second time limit.
Writing on Facebook, one
student said it was “quite
appalling that a debate
between students is being
mediated by someone
who ‘corrects’ any time
the candidates make a
criticism of the central
Union and staff.”
Zhang said: “the debate
format was poor, with the
moderator being Union
staff…and interrupting
