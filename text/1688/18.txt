Dispatches from the VAULT Festival
D
ean joined
the army, and
‘Danny’ joined
the Islamic
State. Dean has been
captured by ISIS, and is
currently tied to a pole
with Danny as his guard.
Both men had grown up
in the UK. Bismillah! An
ISIS Tragicomedy is an
hour-long conversation
between the two, ex-
ploring issues in British
society, from racism,
radicalisation to disen-
chanted youth, as well as
the portrayal of terrorism
and those that join the
other side.
Longlisted for the
Amnesty International
Freedom of Expression
Award 2015, Bismillah!
treads cautiously into an
area that is rarely touched
on by the arts – exploring
the psyche of those that
leave Western societies to
join jihadist causes, and
their motivations.
Following a successful
run at the Edinburgh
Fringe in 2015, this pro-
duction last week at the
Vault festival is the show’s
London debut. Director
Matthew Greenhough
performs in his own show
as Dean, convincing as a
young Northerner trying
to find his place in the
world, in an environment
where good opportunities
for young people are
scarce. “I’m not here to
kill Muslims” he retorts
when Danny accuses him,
“I’m here because it’s my
job. I needed it.” After
a grim stint working in
Wetherspoons, Dean saw
joining the Army as his
best option to a better life.
But does one’s job
reflect one’s values?
Danny seems to think so,
and in contrast to Dean,
he joined ISIS out of the
naive belief that he could
help his people, whom he
saw as being attacked by
the West. Despite their
differences, the two bond
over working poorly-paid
shift jobs and the ridicu-
lous price of a WHSmith
meal deal, as well as lousy
holidays around the UK
and girl problems. Yet, at
no point does one feel that
the characters are one-di-
mensional – for example,
Danny’s violent side kicks
in when, in the middle of
a very pleasant conver-
sation, Dean expresses
disbelief when he learnt
that Danny did not drink.
There is a sense that these
casual comments remind
Danny of the experience
of never being respect-
ed, and triggers him to
reassert the power balance
in the pair.
IssuesinmodernBritish
society are woven into
the narrative, including
Danny’s experiences of
religious discrimination
and school bullying. Both
are youths who feel that
they have hit a dead end,
with the army and ISIS
being viable ways out of
their situations. While
the show’s exploration of
terrorism only scratches
the surface, it manages to
give a nuanced portrayal
of the issues that highlight
just how complex and
multifaceted the problem
is – all the more impres-
sive for an hour-long
show.
In his post-show talk,
Greenhough explains that
he wanted to use comedy
to tackle complex issues.
Dr Sarah Ilott, a lecturer
in film and literature at
Manchester Metropolitan
University who was also
speaking at the talk, said
that comedy helps to make
uncomfortable situations
more accessible. Indeed,
Bismillah! is both hilar-
ious and deeply serious,
and a valuable addition to
the conversation around
radicalising youth.
P
hilipp Oberlohr
knows you. He
knows your past,
and can predict
your future. Or at least, he
claims he does. Dubbed as
‘Vienna’s master illusion-
ist’, Oberlohr returned to
the Vault Festival with a
new mind-reading show,
Das Fest.
Despite Oberlohr being
branded as an illusionist,
the show was less an illu-
sionary experience than an
interactive mind-reading
show. Using audience’s
stories written on slips of
paper, he makes a show
of being able to predict
their memories and future
without reading them.
Oberlohr appears on stage
wearing a furry cape, and
delivers a speech involv-
ing polar bears and Freud.
He then splits the audience
into two; from one group
he asks for a past memory,
and from the other he asks
for a dare for themselves.
These slips of paper were
then folded up and left in
umbrellas on the stage.
While it is conceivable
that impressive sleights of
hand allowed him to read
these slips without the
audience noticing, there
were some truly baffling
tricks, such as correctly
predicting audience
members’ birthdays and
star signs. In between
drawing out audience’s
dares and physically il-
lustrating memories using
props, Oberlohr tries to
link these stories together
with lyrical imagery and
metaphysical musings
about the influence of
memories and fears about
the future.
After a spiel about a
house on fire and shoelac-
es that tie all the elements
of one’s life together,
running back to a pair of
shoes in the centre of the
fire, Oberlohr picks up
a slip of paper and reads
off a memory about a flat
burning down and the
only thing he saved being
a pair of shoes gifted by
his girlfriend. Details
such as these suggest
that not every memory
he picks up might be
true. However, perhaps
that was not meant to be
seen as ‘mind-reading’ as
much as an accessory to
his overarching theme.
The nature of mind-
reading shows requires
one to suspend one’s dis-
beliefandsimplyenjoythe
tricks. If I allow myself to
fully immerse in the pos-
sibility of mind-reading,
the show was fairly enter-
taining. No doubt also that
Oberlohr was very skilful
in executing his tricks.
However, the lyrical
imagery used to link the
individual tricks together
are slightly contrived.
A coherent storyline or
overarching theme is
important in shows such
as these, and in this case,
I believe could have been
more fluent. Nevertheless,
Oberlohr himself is a very
likeable personality, and
Das Fest entertained.
‘What, WHSmith meal deals cost £4.99?!’// Wound Up Theatre
Ben Whishaw delivers layered performance as Brutus
Innovative staging, classic rock and modern costuming, makes The Bridge’s adaptation an unique experience.
T
here was a time
we killed the
King/ We tried
to change the
world too fast/ Now we
have got another King/
He is no better than the
last.” – I found this play
resonated rather neatly (or
should I say vice versa)
with the lyrics from Les
Misérables’ musical
film in 2012. In this
modern-dress production
of Shakespeare’s Julius
Caesar in Bridge Theatre
directed by Nicholas
Hytner, the relations
between populism and au-
tocracy was explored with
a new layer of complexity
granted by the promenade
experience.
The play started with
live rock music. After
Caesar’s triumphant
return from war, senators
Cassius and Brutus
feared he had become
too powerful and might
accept the offer to become
the emperor of Rome.
Though Brutus hesitated
to take action, he was
eventually convinced
by Cassius. The two
planned the assassination
with their conspirators.
On the Ides of March,
Caesar ignored multiple
warnings that a assassi-
nation might take place,
including the one from his
wife Calpurnia, and went
to the Senate. Suddenly,
gunshot tore through the
air, and the crowd fell
to the ground in shock,
revealing the conspirators
holding their guns. Caesar
was shot and paralysed
on his throne, and then he
saw Brutus, his very dear
friend among the assas-
sins. Silence fell, tension
“No two
people’s
experiences of
the play will be
the same”
“Michelle
Fairley
delivered
an eloquent
and precise
performance”
built, and was resolved
by the famous line: “Et
tu, Brute?” Then, Caesar
opened his arms, accept-
ing his inevitable death,
and was killed by Brutus’
final shot. Brutus deliv-
ered a speech to the public
explaining the reason
of the assassination. He
claimed though he loved
Caesar, he loved Rome
more, and he did what
he did for the liberation
of its people. Absurdly,
when the crowd came
to accept and support
Brutus for his actions,
they exclaimed “Let him
be Caesar!”, completely
missing Brutus’ point,
echoing with Cassius’
previous statement re-
garding Caesar: “I know
he wouldn’t be a wolf if
the Romans didn’t act
like sheep”,. Antony,
Caesar’s supporter, was
allowed to give a speech
at the funeral. Though he
promised not to blame
the death of Caesar on
the conspirators, Antony
secretly swore to avenge
Caesar, and incited the
public against Brutus.
Antony teamed up with
Octavius and Lepidus to
fight Brutus and his ac-
complices. The war ended
with Brutus and Cassius
both committing suicide.
After Antony found their
bodies, he praised Brutus
as “the noblest Roman
of them all” and returned
to Rome to celebrate his
victory.
The play made some
interesting adaptations
to suit its modern-dress
production. The assassi-
nation was done by gun
instead of knife, giving
it a more contemporary
visual and sound impact.
Furthermore, in the
original play, Antony
provoked animosity of
the crowd towards Brutus
and his accomplices by
allocating each wound
on Caesar’s body to a
particular conspirator. In
this version this was done
by allocating the tears on
the lining of Caesar’s suit
left by the bullets.
Marcus Brutus was an
ambiguous character. He
was driven by both the
greater good and self-in-
terest, though he com-
mitted a dreadful murder
he was nevertheless
driven by his morals. Ben
Wishaw brought a layer
of irony to this noblest
murderer, entertained the
crowd to disbelieving
laughter when he tried
to justify his motivation.
Michelle Fairley deliv-
ered an eloquent and
precise performance as
Caius Cassius. She was
determined and manip-
ulative, cruel but not
without tenderness. David
Calder sold his Caesar as
a populist with authority
and ego; his personal
charisma won the cheers
of the audience when he
marched across the crowd.
David Morrisey gave a
passionate and opportun-
istic Mark Antony, and
Adjoa Andoh was simply
spectacular as Casca.
Bridge Theatre is a very
intimate space. The stalls
seating was removed for
this play to give audience
with standing tickets a
promenade experience as
one of the mob in the play.
The round staging limited
the stage settings, but this
was counterbalanced by
the atmosphere created
by the lighting and sound
designed by Bruno Poet
and Paul Arditti, led by
the stage designer Bunny
Christie. Spatial flexibility
was also achieved by the
rises and falls of different
parts of the stage, which,
apart from conveying
the play with further
dimensions, aided the
dynamics of the crowd.
You can choose your own
perspectives throughout
the play – either from
the front or the side, and
either wide-angle from
distant or close-up from
beside the stage – and
hear different conversa-
tions in the crowd. At the
end of the night, you will
leave with your unique
montage, knowing that no
two experiences would be
the same.
This play is ultimately
about an attempt to end
dictatorship with the
death of the dictator. We
can see in retrospect that
the assassination led to a
series of civil wars, which
resulted in autocracy for
the rest of Rome’s history.
This play has remained
so contemporary because
history continually repeats
itself. What matters is not
the fall of the dictator, but
who and what follows
him.
