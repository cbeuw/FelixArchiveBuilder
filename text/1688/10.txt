In light of dark matter: oldest stars lead to detection
New research on the oldest stars in the universe suggests our understanding of dark matter could be about to
take a huge leap forward.

suggests that we have
the “first direct proof”
that dark matter exists,
as a team of astronomers
analysed absorption lines
from the oldest stars in
the universe. Dark matter
is an invisible stockpile of
mass that we estimate to
make up about 27% of the
universe, and our under-
standing is that it provides
the necessary gravitation-
al forces for galaxies to
hold themselves together.
This enigmatic building
block of the universe is
proving highly elusive,
yet it is almost six times as
abundant as normal ordi-
nary matter. The nature of
dark matter and its effects
are still not fully known.
This is indeed a hot topic
in cosmology research, as
studying dark matter will
give us clues to the nature
of the universe itself.
Professor Judd
Bowman of Arizona
State University led the
research, using Experi-
ment to Detect the Global
Epoch of Reionisation
Signature (EDGES), a
radio telescope which
began recording data
in 2015. The team
measured the absorption
lines corresponding to a
21cm-wavelength-transi-
tion of atomic hydrogen
in spectra of distant stars
formed as early as 180
million years after the Big
Bang. The data show there
is a stronger absorption
signal corresponding to
this 21cm transition than
existing models predict.
According to Professor
Rennan Bakana of Tel
Aviv University in a paper
in Nature last week, this
is conclusive in showing
there were interactions
between dark matter
and ordinary matter in
the early universe. The
evidence suggests dark
matter is generally ‘cold’,
or highly non-relativistic,
meaning that its speed
does not come close to
the speed of light in a
vacuum. Another pivotal
revelation in the study is
that dark matter seems to
be composed of low-mass
particles which are no
heavier than a couple
of proton masses. “This
insight alone has the
potential to reorient the
search for dark matter,”
says Professor Bakana.
Dark matter appears
to have cooled down the
cosmic gas in the early
universe, and so we may
deduce that dark matter
“Professor
Bakana,
writing in
Nature, said
the insight had
“the potential
to reorient the
search for dark
matter”
“Consensus
among
academics
seems to
be that
dark matter
particles are
probably
something
yet to be
discovered”
is at least moderately
cold. However, velocities
predicted by warm dark
matter are potentially
detectable. This is a focal
point in this field, as many
favour the idea that dark
matter manifests a com-
bination of hot, cold, and
warm behaviours. The
evidence so far puts cold
dark matter as the leading
culprit, and the best
candidate for the particle
is the weakly interacting
massive particle (WIMP).
As its name suggests,
dark matter is invisible
in the electromagnetic
spectrum, so does not
interact with the elec-
tromagnetic force; for
dark matter to have sub-
stantial electrodynamic
and nuclear interactions
would go against well-un-
derstood cosmological
models including the Big
Bang. The consensus
among academics seems
to be that dark matter par-
ticles are probably some-
thing that are yet to be
discovered, that uniquely
interact gravitationally
with ordinary matter.
Studying dark
matter may well give us
information about how
the universe came to be,
and how it may end. The
concept of dark matter is
around a century old, yet
we still do not know that
much about it. General
relativity on the other
hand, which has been
around for a similar time,
is well-established with its
principles utilised in GPS.
Further comparable radio
telescope projects include
the Hydrogen Epoch of
Reionisation (HERA)
which will be operational
in the next couple of years,
and the Low Frequency
Aperture Array (LFAA),
which is 2km in diameter,
consisting of millions of
antennae erected in the
Western Australian desert.
It should be operational
this year. Once these
telescopes can replicate
results seen by EDGES,
we will be able to
confirm that the first stars
“revealed” dark matter. As
we the technology catches
up with our desire to
understanding, this field
begins to emerge into
relevance. Cosmologists
can now start working to
prove that anything with a
‘dark’ in front of it is not
just an abstract idea for
something we do not yet
understand, but an actual-
ity.

Words and genes
SCIENCE

L
anguage and
genetics do not
usually go hand
in hand in human
history. Languages are, if
anything, an instrument
for domination – the
epitome of international
prestige as well as com-
mercial and political
supremacy. As the scholar
of Yiddish Max Weinreich
once said: “a language is a
dialect with an army and
a navy”. Empires rise and
impose their speech on the
individuals they conquer,
a speech that is usually
forgotten or radically
changed when the next
generation of conquerors
fall on the shell of a state
that has initiated its decay.
This process happened
in Britain, which lost
its own homegrown
dialect of Latin when the
Anglo-Saxons came to the
island; or can be seen in
Turkey, where Greek lost
its place to a language that
was first spokes in the vast
steppes of Siberia. But
while languages change,
the people do not. Many
modern British citizens
are direct descendants
of the worshippers of
Stonehenge and Turks
from the soldiers that gave
Byzantium its greatest
glories. However, while
their languages faded, the
continuous genetic link
was untouched, and the
newcomers provided only
negligible amounts of new
genetic material. Until
now, this was believed to
be a universal phenome-
non, the only exceptions
being the colonization of
America and Australia,
which resulted in both
tremendous genetic and
linguistic changes. And
then, the whole scheme
fell apart in Vanuatu.
Vanuatu is an island
country in the Western
Pacific. Not many people
know that the small nation
is one of the most linguis-
tically diverse places in
the world: 113 languages
are spoken by a population
of around 270,000. All the
the islands that neighbour
New Guinea – Vanuatu
being among them. The
group that moved East
gave origin to the Lapita,
the ancestors of the
famed Polynesians who
explored the Pacific from
Hawaii to New Zealand.
Thus, as Vanuatu is the
focal point of the Lapita
expansion, it should be
expected that Vanuatuans
are genetically close to
other Polynesian peoples.
Instead, they are very
similar to inhabitants of
New Guinea, who speak
a completely different
group of languages. This
is not a strange occurrence
in history; as explained
before, conquerors usually
impose their languages. It
would not be farfetched
to think that the original
Papuan inhabitants of
Vanuatu were invaded by
a wave of Austronesians.
Vanuatu would then be
another case of language
replacement; however, the
people would still be the
same. Except, this time, it
was the other way around.
When researchers from
the Max Planck Insti-
tute of Human History
recently analysed the
remains of the earliest
inhabitants of Vanuatu,
they found that they were
indistinguishable from
the individuals taken in
Lapita burial sites from
other Pacific islands, and
quite different from the
modern Vanuatuans. In
other words, it seems that
Vanuatu was colonised by
the neighbouring Papuans
who imposed their genetic
legacy – itself an event
that occurs rarely in
human history. What is
more astonishing is that
the conquerors adopted
the language of the people
they replaced. This phe-
nomenon is unprecedent-
ed in history, and points
to slower but steady
process of conquest. At
first, only a few Papuans
moved to the islands,
and some adopted the
language of the original
inhabitants. As the flow of
Papuans increased, there
was a gradual change
in the genetic make-up
of the population of the
islands, but the languages
remained the same. After
thousands of years, the
genetic heritage of the
Austronesians had all
but disappeared, but
their language remained,
spoken by the people that
had replaced them.
The special case of
Vanuatu shows facts that
have been long held as
universal in the study
of human populations
are not as true as once
thought. The complex
relationships between
human populations are
still far from understood,
and there are probably
still many Vanuatus in
the most remote parts
of world, waiting to be
discovered. Who knows
what other long held foun-
dations of anthropology
could be torn to shreds.
The fascinating genetic history of the Vanuatuan communities has finally been mapped, and it is much more
surprising than previously expected.
