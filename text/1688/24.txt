Worth the hype? By Chloe
This week Food writer Bláithín Dockery investigates whether By Chloe, a new addition to the London vegan food
scene, is a worthwhile brand or just cashing in on the “trendiness” of veganism.

A
couple of years
ago merely call-
ing a food vegan
would have
made many of us shudder,
picturing something dry
and tasteless. However,
there has clearly been a
revolution as veganism
has changed its image
from oddball hippies to
vibrant health-conscious
millennials. With the
number of vegans in
Britain rising by 360%
over the last 10 years, it
is no wonder vegan-based
menus have been popping
up across the restaurant
industry. Cashing in on
this trend are a number
of completely vegan fast
food eateries (mainly
in east London) that
have recently appeared,
Founded by Chloe Cos-
carelli in 2015, the first
by CHLOE opened on
Bleeker Street in NYC,
serving vegan baked
goods, sandwiches and
salads. The first location
was a huge success,
attracting trendy New
Yorkers who were eager
to try the “next big thing.”
Ten more locations
opened across the US in
the following years, but
international expansion
was the next goal for the
brand.Thanks to London’s
vibrant food scene and the
success of other NYC-
based brands such as
Dominique Ansel, it was
chosen as by CHLOE’s
first international
location, where it opened
in early February 2018. I
was particularly excited
about this opening, having
admittedly already tried
by CHLOE in New York
where I was completely
blown away by the food.
However, I wondered if
it would maintain this
quality so far away from
its original location.
First Impressions
Arriving at by
CHLOE’s Covent Garden
“A neon pink
sign said‘Guac
Save The
Queen’”
eatery on a warm Saturday
afternoon, I was initially
surprised by how large the
site was, particularly as
the New York location is
rather small. Clearly there
were high expectations
for its first international
location. Opening the
door I was amazed to see
a huge queue snaking
around the tables leading
up to the ordering counter.
I knew it was still in its
early days (it had only
opened a week earlier)
but I really did not expect
this many people! Luckily
the queue moved quickly,
and I passed the time by
admiring the décor and
examining the menu. The
restaurant had a very light
and airy feeling, thanks
to the large windows and
white painted brick walls,
featuring wooden shelves
upon which mini cacti
were placed (oh how mil-
lennial!). On one wall was
a neon pink sign saying
“Guac Save The Queen”
which was probably some
interior designer’s attempt
to make the location more
“London”. Other quirky
features includes the egg
shaped seat swings (also
seen in the NY resaurant)
and a merchandise stand
(because obviously it’s
not just about the food-
it’s about the brand).
When I finally reached the
order counter I picked a
range of food items to try
in order to make a proper
judgement.
The Food
After making a rather
grand order: the classic
burger, pesto meatball sub
and sweet potato fries, I
waited patiently for my
food to be prepared. After
a relatively short wait,
I hopped up quickly to
collect my order as the
staff shouted my name
and settled down to begin
a food adventure. I first
started with the classic
burger, made with a
tempeh-lentil-chia-walnut
patty (try saying that in
a hurry). The patty itself
was relatively small
and flat but overall the
burger certainly had that
picture-perfect look,
complete with a slice
of tomato, lettuce and a
golden bun. Taking my
first bite, I must admit that
I was rather unimpressed;
the patty was too stodgy
and kept crumbling
apart. Other flavours of
the burger were better,
especially the signa-
ture beetroot ketchup;.
However, I found the
pickles slightly overpow-
ering and too sharp. Next
up were the sweet potato
fries. The fries were okay
but weren’t anything
special: not particularly
crispy and ,in my opinion,
slightly too soft. The
one saving grace was
by CHLOE’s speciality
condiments including the
beetroot ketchup as well
as its chipotle aioli. The
ketchup was sweet but not
overpowering and the aioli
had a nice kick and a rich
smoky flavour. Finally, I
tried the Pesto Meatball
Sub, which was what I
really had been looking
forward to. Although a
slightly clumsier food to
eat than a simple burger,
I managed to take a
generous bite, getting all
the different elements in
one go. The bread was a
sweet soft pillow hugging
the perfectly round Porto-
bello “meatballs”, which
were settled on a tangy
tomato marinara sauce.
Topping the meatballs
was a nutty, rich basil
pesto and creamy cashew
“mozzarella.” All together
the flavours mixed really
well, although it was
rather filling due to the
dense “meatballs.”

Worth the hype?
Having amassed a cult following thanks to the
“trendy” nature of veganism, by CHLOE’s
hype was huge, as demonstrated by the major
queue I endured. The brand really stepped
up to the mark by choosing one of the most
popular tourist destinations in London and
creating a picture-perfect establishment, from
the pink neon signs to quirky swing seats.
However, with the competition for vegan
eateries heating up, it’s not just about aes-
thetics. Although the meatball sub was great,
considering the price and quality of the rest of
the food items I’m sad to say that by CHLOE
was not worth the hype.
Price
Burger: £9.00
Meatball Sub: £9.60
Fries: £4.00
Best part
by CHLOE’s speciality condiments (really
innovative flavours!)
Worst part
Price/ Classic burger
including Temple of
Seitan and What the Pitta!
These joints not only
attract vegans but also
people who are simply
curious about how tasty
vegan food can be (not to
mention getting a quality
trendy pic for insta). This
major market is attracting
more established vegan
chains and that is where
by CHLOE steps in.
Over in the US,
veganism has also had
a major revolution, par-
ticularly in New York,
birthplace of by CHLOE.
