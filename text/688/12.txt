IC ladies vs Kent
Yet another Whitewash by our
ladies team. — a nine nil win
against Kent, who incidentally
didn't even bother turning up!
This result means that the
ladies have won all four of their
games, and will go forward to
represent IC in the regional
play—offs.
Thanks to the team of Susan,
Helen, Jane, Janet, Julie and
Farida.
DARTS
Rikki saves
the day
Blacklion—3 IC—4
After four very mediocre results
the lads rallied together to
produce a fine victory, not only
winning the match, but also the
legs of the cup eights and
secretary's cup. This victory was
somewhat inspired by Rikki who
collided with a parking meter on
the way there and had to go to St
Stephens hospital for treatment.
He took no part in the game and
his absence allowed us to
c o n c e n t r a t e and emerge
victorious. Buz and Richard
were the stars (as always), aided
and abetted by Neil, Alan and
John. Pete and our glorious
leader Ian were again on target
with a three apiece! Matu
replaced Pete and showed
promise. Fat knackered Jaz was.
Previous results: Harrington-4,
IC-3; IC-2, Magpie & Srump-5,
Finborough-3, IC-4, IC-2,
Peterborough-5.
MIXED HOCKEY
Draw with
Holloway
Last week twelve hearty souls,
brave and true, went forth to
besiege the goal of Royal
Holloway. Due to several
miscalculations and a total lack
of ability IC found themselves
1—0 down at half time. After a
rousing team-talk during the
interval, h o w e v e r , a re-
structured side found the going
more easy. Superior play from
the ladies and i n s p i r i n g
comments from the 'keeper,
Chris Jones, spurned the team
into more constructive hockey.
'You hit it to me, I hit it to him and
he put it in' quoth Louise —
referring to D Wigney, herself
and Chris Alcers respectively.
Sgt Pepper's ballet lessons
p a i d d i v i d e n d s ! E l e g a n t
pirouettes left the opposition
flabbergasted — unfortunately
not flabbergasted enough.
Finally Paul Dubenski, having
failed to employ his forehead to
full advantage decided to use his
stick instead to much greater
effect.
Full time saw the score at
1—1, a fair result despite the fact
we did not win.
Team: Chris, Jones, Alice
Banks, Ian Mace, Liz Clark,
Louise Wakeling, Duncan
Wigney, Chris Alcers, Elaine

WATERPOLO
Imperial —
ULU
Champs
IC vs King's College 10—5
IC vs Charing Cross 6—5
Imperial C o l l e g e became
Champions of the London
University Waterpolo after
beating both King's College and
Charing Cross Hospital teams.
IC played King's College in the
S e m i - F i n a l s of the U L U
knockout competition. King's
began the game nil-four ahead on
handicap. The King's team
contained some sharp individual
talent but lacked coherence.
O n e defensive error on
Imperial's behalf allowed Kings
to score their only goal.
Imperial's ten goals come from a
number of push shots and put
College in the final. Charing
Cross also reached the final and
began the game with a nil five
handicap lead. After a superb
first time shot the score was two
five. This match contained an
excellent last goal, scored by
John Barnes after he swam the
length of the pool to lob a shot
over the goalies's head. Once
again the U L U trophy remains in
South Kensington.
Last week saw the completion of
the Regional Rounds of the U A U
competitiohns in Badminton,
Football, Golf, Hockey , Netball,
Rugby and Squash. Three IC
teams have definitely qualified
for the last 16 in their respective
competitions: these are Ladies
Badminton and both the Rugby
first and second teams. The
Football third team will also
qualify for the last 16 if they beat
the winner of the South East
(North) group — U C L and the
third placed team in the South
West. This week the Rugby and
Badminton teams are taking part
in play offs against the winners of
the SE (North) competitions to
determine the winner of the
complete SE group who will then
SNOOKER
Qualifying
hopes after
Manor Park
draw
Manor Park 'B'-6 IC-6
There was never much danger of
IC finishing with a points deficit
from this handicap match. The
past record of the Manor Park
side meant that we started with a
180 point advantage, but with
qualification from our group
depending on final points total it
was essential to hold on to as
many of those 180 points as
possible.
The team began well with Ian
Grindall winning both of his
frames and Eddie S m i t h
capturing another to leave IC
with a lead of over 100 points.
The matches of Adrian Feasby
and John West provided another
3 out of a possible four frames
and it was soon apparent that we
were going to claim full benefit of
our initial lead.
In fact as began the last frame
of the evening I was in the not too
difficult position of having to
avoid a 180 points defeat if IC
were to finish winners. This task I
was the equal of and so we ended
with a haul of 175 points which
can't do our hopes of qualifying
any harm at all.
get a home draw in the last 16.
The draws for the next round
are:
Ladies Badminton:
South East I v North East II
East Midlands I v South East II
Rugby I:
South East I v West III
East Midlands I v South East II
Rugby II:
South East I v South III
South West I v South East II
Congratulations go to G Harker
who has been selected to
represent the Southern Division
of U A U in a cross-country
representative match against
BPSA and the Army, and to B
Gamblin who has been chosen
as a reserve for this match.
U A U General Committee —
Friday 2 November
This meeting consisted of some
six hours of total boredom and
decided practically nothing of
importance. The only matters of
any direct relevance to IC
students are:
1 T w o footballs will be
purchased for the football club,
out of a grant U A U receive from
the FA.
2 Subscriptions and entrance
fees are likely to rise in the near
future to c o v e r ' r i s i n g
admininstration costs'.
3 P l a q u e s , m e d a l s and
pennants will no longer be
presented to teams or individuals
winning U A U Championships.
Individuals will be able to order
these items, through IC's U A U
Rep after a Championship has
taken place.
4 The present system of
deciding which teams qualify for
the last 16 is to remain unaltered
although this is biased against
teams from the South East. At
present only two teams out often
qualify directly from the South
East and two teams out of five
from the South West. A fifth
place exists for the team which
wins a play-off between the third
place teams in the SE and SW
groups. It was proposed that this
fifth place should automatically
be given to the third placed SE
Team, but this was rejected
mainly because Surrey, Sussex,
Brunei, City and East Anglia
abstained and L S E didn't even
turn-up.
5 The U A U representative
match programme will not be cut
from two fixtures to one in any
sport.
