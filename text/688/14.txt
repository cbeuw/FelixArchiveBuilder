STAFF VACANCY - required to start this year if possible
Job Description
Short term help is required on a project to investigate the
response of soils to conventional high-explosive blast. The
initial duration would be for up to three months, starting as soon
as possible, either part-time or full-time. However, it is probable
that the additional work will be available until at least April 1986.
The immediate requirement is to assist in the design of an
instrumentation system to measure the transient stress and
movement within a soil mass subjected to a high-explosive
blast.
It will be necessary to have good practical research
experience. A basic understanding of fluid or soil mechanics
and shock waves would be helpful.
Applicants may have a broadly theoretical or experimental
backgrouned in Civil, Mechanical, Mining, Electrical or
Aeronautical Engineering, Physics or, perhaps, Mathematics.
The post might suit a post-doc or staff applicant; just possibly a
writing-up Phd student.
Salary — a salary will be paid based on the appropriate
University scale.
Further information may be obtained by contacting Dr S H
Perry (Int 4731) Room 325 Civil Engineering, as soon as
possible.
