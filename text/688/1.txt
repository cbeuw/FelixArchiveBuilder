NUS slams
Tory cuts
The National Union of Students has reacted strongly
against grant cuts announced by the Government last week.
Action began last Wednesday with a national 24-hour
occupation of Universities, Polytechnics and Colleges.
Imperial College Union is not affiliated to NUS and did not
take part in this protest. An NUS spokeswoman said that
this action was well supported with 150 establishments from
all over the country involved in sit-ins and lecture boycotts.
A national rally, 'Going for
Broke', has been organised for
3.30pm next Wednesday in the
Queen Elizabeth H a l l and
Jubilee Gardens. Speakers will
include N U S President, Phil
Woolas and a demonstration
activity as yet unknown will be
organised.
The N U S believe that the
Government intend to 'privatise'
the higher education system as in
America, and replace the current
system of grants with students
loans.
According to a special edition
of London Student the Under
Secretary of State for Education,
M r Peter Brooke, has discussed
radical proposals put forward by
the Adam Smith Institute. This
body 'innovates proposals and
creative thought into public
policy debate 'to promote free
choice and a free economy.
According to the document, M r
Brooke said that he would prefer
to see the banks (rather than
Governments) take on the
administration of a loans
scheme. Although the report
claims that the document had
come from the Department of
Education and Science, a
departmental spokesman denied
knowledge of its existence and he
reiterated the government's view
that loans would not be
introduced.
Squatters
stay
The University of London has
been given an possession order
for 66-72 Gower Street, the
building occupied by students
from U C L and LSE. The order
does not become effective until
November 30, providing U L U
ensure that surveyors are allowed
free access to the building.
NUS lawyers who acted for the
students opposed the order on
the grounds that the University
had no immediate use for the
building and said that a
negociated solution should be
found. The University said they
needed access to the building so
that surveyors could start
planing its conversion into a
teaching area for U C L .
Students o c c u p i e d the
building, which was formerly a
G C E examination office, in
protest at the lack of
accommodation for London
students. The University, U C L
and L S E offered a package deal
to persuade the students to
leave.This included the offer of
accommodation in U C L and
LSE. The squatters saw this as
queue-jumping, and decided to
remain in 66-72 Gower Street.
Changes
at RCA
Sweeping changes at the Royal
College of Art were yesterday
passed by the Senate, the
college's ruling body, to take
effect from October 1985. The
restructuring will affect all but
three of the college's schools and
faculties. Five schools are to be
closed and there will be a reduced
intake into a further five.
Existing obligations and teaching
commitment to the present
students will be honoured. The
normal course length currently
three years, will be reduced to
only two.
The changes are to make way
for eighty new places in eight new
departments as well as modest
increases in two of the existing
schools. The number of students
will remain at the present level of
six hundred before a major
expansion over the next few
years, say college officials.
The R C A students union views
the changes as a bombshell. They
say that there was no
consultation and the first they
heard of the proposals was in the
form of a press release.
At an extraordinary general
meeting last week the union
noted that the recommendations
will affect all students and
members of the R C A . They
believe that the Academic Policy
Committee, where the proposals
were decided, is only meant to
put forward policy options to the
R C A Senate where they are
debated in full. They also believe
