Tagliatelle alia Carbonarra
11b tagliatelle (or other pasta)
3 eggs
4-6oz bacon (vegetarians could use chopped walnuts)
4oz cheese, grated
2 tablespoons olive oil
a pinch of pepper
finely chopped clove of garlic
Dr Johnson once said 'It was a good dinner, to be sure;
but not a dinner to invite a man to'. If anyone invited me
out to dine on bacon and eggs I would be deeply
offended; yet my friends ask me to cook this for them.
Set a large pan of water to boil, Meanwhile cut the
bacon into small pieces and fry in the olive oil until crisp.
After three minutes add the garlic. Set aside. Cook the
tagliatelle according to the directions on the packet.
Beat the eggs in a large bowl and add the cheese. Just
before the tagliatelle is ready re-heatthe bacon. Drain the
pasta and stir into the egg and cheese mixture. Stir in the
bacon and olive oil, and the pepper. Serve at once. The
heat of the pasta is enough to cook the egg and make a
rich creamy sauce.
