First round
success
IC 1st X V 37 Kent X V 6
IC finished top of their group in
the opening rounds of the U A U
with an impressive victory
against Kent.
Kent opened the scoring with
a penalty, soon equalled with a
penalty by Seccombe. IC then
pushed forwards and after a deft
handling move in the backs,
Thompson timed a beautiful pass
for Seccombe to score in the
corner. Unfortunately the team
seemed to lose conviction and
after another Kent penalty IC
were only winning 7-6 at half-
time.
The second half was a different
story with the wind and sun at
our backs, Morris, making many
penetrating runs into Kent's half.
After two more penalties from
Seccombe, Gilkes scored an
excellent try creating space on
the wing from nothing, duly
converted by Seccombe. All the
tries after this were converted by
Seccombe, so he'll not be
mentioned again! Exley won an
excellent ball at the line out
ensuring that IC were nearly
always on Kent's line. Parker
broke from the base of the scrum
and towered over to score. After
another excellent backs move
Clarke passed inside to Hargave
to score. Through the whole
game Reza won excellent ball
and always helped the backs
when stranded with the ball. The
fifth try score by Seccombe
came from a delicate pass from
second row Mackay. Hagger had
one of his best days reading the
fly half accurately and quickly. In
the second half the front row was
s o l i d . Individually Fyffe's
chipping was immaculate, Ferris
in his best game for us failed to
score although he has two tries
already this season. Jenkins was
robbed on their line after an
amazing sidestep from a short
line. Phillips' tactical kicking was
average.
Team Ferris, Jenkins, Fyffe,
Exley, Mackay, Parker, Reza,
Hargrove, Hagger, Phillips,
Clarke, Morris, Gilkes,
Secoombe, Thompson.
IC 1st XI 2 Q M C 1st XI 2
A hard fought and generally even
game gave rise to this rather
indecisive result in the first round
of the U L U Challenge Cup on a
cold and dreary afternoon at
Harlington last Saturday.
Anxiety and desperation ran
high when both captain and kit
failed to turn up for the coach,
but just as all hope seemed lost,
they arrived.
Early on both sides struggled
for the upper hand and much
solid defensive work was
required especially for the agile
young debutant Jim Brannigan.
But midway through the first half
Q M C scored a rather fortunate
goal. IC then surged forward into
attack culminating just before
the b r e a k w h e n G a r r y
Lawrence, struggling through
with a 'head injury', thundered a
free kick from the edge of the
box past a bewildered Q M C
keeper.
After another rousing half-
time team-talk from captain Neil,
IC went out re-invigorated for
the second half- More fast end-
to-end football ensued and M r
Lawrence must claim the
creative genius for the third goal
of the game, when after much
fancy footwork he split the IC
defence with a perfectly timed
through ball to give Q M C
another slender lead. Frustration
followed for IC as they were
thwarted time and time again
until Neil slammed home the
equalliser from close range.
A good team performance and
another hard game in prospect
for the replay on Wednesday.
Team P Simpson, J Brannigan,
B Goldsbrough, R Richards, G
Davy, G Lawrence, N
Vandeberger, P Bravery, T
Dutton, D Lynne, P Dent.
