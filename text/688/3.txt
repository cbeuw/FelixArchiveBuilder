Mooney sausage
trumpet shocker
A new electronic sausage
trumpet has been installed in the
Sherfield kitchens after an out-
break of woodwrorm in unfrozen
sausages earlier this term.
For two months vegetarian
and normal Mooney sausages
were mistakenly stored and
served in place of each other, and
woodworm infested the normal
sausages which were no longer
frozen. Rentokil eradicated the
immediate problem but Mr
Mooney has purchased a sausage
trumpet to stop such a mix up
happening again.
The electronic trumpet is the
latest type and was bought at a
substantial discount as the
manufactures wished to use it as
a show piece model.
'A sausage trumpet has been
my aim for ages,' a delighted Mr
Mooney told F E L I X .
The new model is more
v e r s a t i l e t h a n p r e v i o u s
mechanised ones, and will take
sausages, frankfurters, salami,
chipolatas, black pudding and
liverwurst. Mr Mooney has had it
programmed to confuse pork
and beef.
Old trumpets were generally
very noisy with, valves, bells and
lots of tubing, but the new model
is quite mute.
'From now on, there is no need
for any student to eat an
untrumpeted sausage. If they
have any cause to think their
sausage has not been properly
trumpted, they should bring it
back at the time,' said Mr
Mooney. He added that if the
electronic machine was a success,
then a Gabriel silver trumpet
would be installed for formal
dinners and for use in the staff
dining room where there is
thought to be a demand for a
high-class sausage trumpet.
Yesterday claims by the A L F
(Animal Looney Front) to have
tampered with pastry in the
College Kitchens, were hotly
denied by Mr Mooney, 'We've
been using Plaster of Paris for
years, so there's nothing new
about that. If there are any
complaints about the food,
customers should bring it up to
the staff at the counter'.
Not lost
The IC Security Office lias issued
a list of lost-property that it has
received since the start of term.
The list, mainly clothing,
includes a grey suit, anoraks,
jackets, blazers, raincosts, shorts,
mackintoshes, rubber gloves,
goggles, rugby-boots, jumpers,
towels, shawls, scarves and
umbrellas.
'Property not claimed by the
end of term, will have to be
disposed of', said J o h n
Buroughs, Security Officer.
Toy
stamps
Most of you will know that the
College has a Day Nursery in
Prince's Gardens for the care of
children of students, post-grads
and staff. The main running
costs, staff salaries etc are met
from the fees paid by the parents
but, as in all ventures of this kind
, there is a continuing need for
extra, voluntary funds to buy
toys , puzzles, books etc for the
children to use.
For the past few years the
Nursery has been able to raise
some money for this purpose by
collecting and selling Stamps
given by College members from
their imcoming mail. Many of us
get Christmas cards from
overseas. If you could save the
stamps from their or from any
other source and send them to
Sue Thornett (Day Nursery,
Princes's Gardens) they would be
much appreciated.
The staff and children of the
Day Nursery would like to thank
all those who sent them stamps
during the last academic year.
Three return
from Morocco
lizard study
Three Life Science students from
Imperial College have recently
returned from a two month
expedition to the High Atlas
mountains in Morocco. The
students, Johan Kuylenstierna
21, expedition leader, Christo-
pher Weedon 21, and Anthony
Hall 21, all took part in the
scientific work. The project was
to study the behaviour of a
previously unstudied Gecko (a
small lizard). The group also
compiled a list of all bird life
observed in the vacinity of the
village Imlil. During their four
week stay in Imlil the three
received an insight into the life
style of the of the Berber people
who live in the mountains. The
Berbers do not recognise the
government of Rabat, the capital
of Morocco, and they do not pay
taxes, and as a result of this they
have no electricity, no running
water and no paved roads. When
their studies were complete the
group was free to travel in the
mountains and to visit the other
villages which scrape a living on
the fertile valley floor. Just
before the end of the trip the
expedition was able to take time
off and climb the peak of
Toubkal, which at over four
thousand and one hundred
metres is the highest point in
North Africa.
The lizard studies were carried
out on the behalf of Dr Arnold of
the British Museum and the bird
studies were compiled for the
University of M a r r a k e s h ,
Morocco. The expedition is
extremely grateful to the
Imperial College Exploration
Board for the generous financial
assistance recieved.
