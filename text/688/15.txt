continued from front page
that the recommendations on
course changes and closures have
been made on a financial andcost
effective premise without due
consideration of their academic
validity or the respective
departments wishes. Despite
their lobby of the Senate
Meeting, the proposals were
passed with a large majority. It is
widely thought that the
Department of Education and
Science, who fund the college,
became aware of a drop in the
position and status of the R C A
since the 1960s. In order to stop
the grant being cut, the R C A had
to establish new objectives and a
new policy to meet the challenge
of the 1980s.
The Rector, Jocelyn Stevens,
was recently appointed to
achieve this task. In a statement
following the announcement of
the changes he stressed that the
restructuring would take place
within current financial limits.
He added that it would renew
commitment to research and
would open up two new
directions in which the college
intends to proceed.

Libraries
shake-up
Probably you think the Central
libraries Committee is an
insignificant dry-as-dust bunch
of tedious academics, meeting
once a term to have a quiet cup of
tea and congratulate each other
on how wonderful our main
library facilities are.
Y o u are mistaken. The
Committee met on Tuesday of
last week and hammered out
significant business. Amongst
other things the Haldane library
came in for some harsh criticism.
The Haldane has been operating
since June, as an experiment, the
current system of access from the
Sherfield Building only. It is
debatable as to whether this has
improved ease of entry to the
library but it has certainly cut out
completely the evening and
weekend opening.

The student representatives on
the committee made it quite clear
that the change had not gone
u n n o t i c e d , and was not
welcomed. The point was well
received and after several options
had been discussed (including
simply going back to the old
system) a decision was made.
A proposal will be put put to
the College to install a security
barrier at the Haldane Sherfield
entrance. If this is approved it
will enable the linking door to
Lyon Playfair to be opened at
5.30pm, allowing everyone to
enjoy the fiction library into the
evening.
At present IC Union buys all
the fiction books, records and
cassettes for the Haldane, and
this year it is proposed to spend
£2500. This is seen as woefully
inadequate to maintain an up-to-
date and interesting stock and
great efforts are being made to
pursuade the College that next
year's allocation should be more
realistic to maintain one of the
college's most precious assets.
Tough luck smokers. From
January the whole of the Lyon -
Playfair becomes a no-smoking
zone!

Wellsoc
Wellsoc chairman Nick Maxwell
has reacted strongly to the
resignation of three Wellsoc
Committee members reported in
F E L I X last week.
In their joint resignation letter
F Alii, W Hooper and D
Clements claimed that there had
been 'considerable difficulty in
c o m m u n i c a t i n g with the
Chairman.
'We have come to the
concusion that the society is
being mismanaged by the
Chairman,' they wrote.
M r Maxwell accused the three
of distorting the truth to make
their story more convinving
'The members went out with
such a bang that it must have left
few people in any doubt that
Wellsoc has totally collapsed.
T would like to make it quite
clear to the contrary that Wellsoc
is a sound as ever before, and
probably sounder,' said M r
Maxwell.
'Seven committee members
remain, and they have been the
kernal of our enthusiasm and
activity'.
'The show must go on',
concluded Mr Maxwell.
Wellsoc's first lecture after the
resignation took place on
Monday night when 120 students
heard a talk on space travel. Alan
Bond, an expert on rocket
propulsion, explained the history
of space travel and how the
separate European, American,
and R u s s i a n programmes
developed.
The Russians have now
developed a very large aad
adaptable rocket, with a payload
that is sufficient to build space
stations or even send a manned
expedition to Mars. The speaker
forecast a prestige race to mars
between the super-powers.
M r Bond ended his talk with a
look at colonisation and
economic exploitation, and the
types of vehicles, stations and
factories that would be needed.
One proposed rocket, propelled
by nuclear explosions, would
convert its launch site, into a
desert. A more reslistic idea is a
pulse engine relying upon lasers
concentrating enery onto small
pellets of fuel, forming an
explosion somewhat similar to a
white dwarf, though clearly not
so large. This is how the
'Daedalus' unmanned star
exploration vehicle can travel at
up to 10% of the speed of light.
