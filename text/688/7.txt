SINGLES
Reo Speedwagcrt: Can't Fight
This Feeling
This lot used to make
records. Now it's Christmas
however, they've obviously
decided it'stimeforareturnto
a Keep on Loving You style.
They do what they do very
well. Unfortunately, after a
few listenings, this one begins
to get very boring. A bit 'sweet'
for my taste.
Nik Kershaw: The Riddle
Sounds like the Goombay
Dance Band doesn't it? It's
almost as awful as well. Nik,
the 3ft giant from Birmingham
maintains his wimpy, plastic
image to keep his teeny fans
happy. Grow up Kershaw!
Even your fans will one day.
The Adventures: Send My
Heart
After talking to a guy from
Chrysalis, at the recent IC gig,
it would appear that the
Adventures have a severe lack
of r e c o r d e d material to
choose a disc from. It is more
BOOKS
Violence
No poems this week. No
travelling and no fashion. We
are looking at dark, dark
places. News at ten, nine,
eight,...
Terrorism, Guerrilla war,
Resistance, call it what you
w i l l . I c o u n t e d t w e l v e
examples in the news last
week without even trying. No
use throwing up the hands in
disbelief or dismay, because
like every other kind of war it
will not stop just because you
know it should. Understand it.
T h e War of the Flea —
Guerrilla Warfare Theory and
Practice' by Robert Taber is a
good, concise survey. Mr
Taber is one of a rare breed —
a Yankee who fought for
Castro. The book covers
theory from Guevara and Mao
T s e - T u n g a n d p r a c t i c a l
examples from Indo-China,
Ireland, Cyprus, Malaya and
the Philippines. Disappoint-
for this reason than any other
that they have been forced to
release this as a follow up to
the cult-successful Another
Silent Day. Quite pleasant but
that's all.
Frankie Goes to Hollywood:
The Power Of Love
Credit has to be given to the
Frankies for such a daring
change of direction from the
phenomenonally successful
Relax and Two Tribes. Almost
certainly this will be Britiain's
Christmas number one. T h e
only question is for how long?
It's very clever, but unfortun-
ately I don't really like it.
Sorry.
Bronski Beat: Ain't Necessar-
ily So
A bit surprising for Bronski
Beat to release a cover as a
single, particularly at this time
of year. Actually, they are
s u r p r i s i n g l y g o o d at it.
Excellent vocal harmonies
and brilliant keyboards. Listen
out for the accidental Aint
nece-celery in the last chorus!
ingly, it misses the present
T r o u b l e s ' because of its
p u b l i c a t i o n date — last
revised 1969. The bias in the
writing is clear, butat leastthe
author is honest about it.
Remember that reading your
own opinionswill nothelpyou
understand someone else's.
If you have the time to
spend, and prefer to use
primary sources, there exists
acombined edition of Guerilla
War texts by Mao Tse-Tung
and Guevara in translation.
Published by Faber in 1964, I
think. Dated, yes, but still in
active use. For instance,
Guevara says that he found
the best way to organise his
f i g h t e r s w a s in s e m i -
autonomous groups of ten.
This provided a useful force,
w h i l s t p r o t e c t i n g t h e
movement as a whole from
infiltration. The IRA didn't
suss that one out until the
mid-seventies. For the other
side of the story see Frank
Kitson's 'Counter Insurgency
Warfare'. Frank was an officer
in the British army and hence
draws on colonial experience.
A g a i n t h e d a m n ' t h i n g
predates the current punch-
up in Northern Ireland. The
only book I have found which
does cover this period from
the Army's side (not counting
t h o s e b y p r o f e s s i o n a l
journalists) is'Contact!'by A F
N Clarke. This gentlemen was
a Captain in the Paras and
obviously enjoyed it in a
strange bitter sort of way. It is
not especially well written
(none of these books are —
must be part of their training),
but is useful for two reasons.
Firstly, it shows clearly and at
first hand the way war
brutalises its practitioners. It
also brings home the fact that
the Army has to deal with
a t t a c k s f r o m ' l o y a l i s t '
Protestants.
I have come across several
references to 'A Minimanual
of Guerilla Warfare' b y a b l o k e
called Marighella. Apparently
it is required reading for
everyone from the Red Army
Faction to the Royal Air Force.
But no bookshop or library
seems to stock it. Perhaps it is
banned because it is too
detailed. Perhaps it is out of
print because no-one else
wants to read it, but I do. If you
can point me in the right
direction, please drop a note
into the FELIX office. Just a
note, though. Try out the
'Good Letter Bomb Guide'
chapter on someone else.
Rather more quaint, but
equally vicious, is 'A Book of
Five Rings' by Miyamoto
Musashi. Three hundred and
fifty years old, and still
chilling. Denis Waterman can
muse on T h e Way of the
Warrior' but Musashi gotthere
first.
'...the way of the warrior is
the resolute acceptance of
death'.
Well, I can't fault that. Does
he drink Carling Black Label?
Y O U ask him. 'A Book of Five
Rings' is a text on strategy by a
master swordsman, who by all
accounts would have made
Errol Flynn swat profusely.
Even older —first published
500 B C — is Su n Tzu's T h e Art
of War'. Not a lot of fun to read
all at one go, but an insight
into a totally different way of
life. There is a rather nice
story about Sun Tzu which
goes like this:
The Emperor of China was
talking to S Z about war, and
asked for a demonstration of
some of its principles. S Z
ordered the harem to stand to
attention . Nothing happened,
e x c e p t that t h e w o m e n
giggled.
'If the orders are not clear,
the General is at fault', said
Sun Tzu inscrutably. The
drummer stopped, and S Z
repeated his order — audibly
this time. Still, he only got
ZREVIEWS I
giggles from the harem.
'If the orders are clear, but
are still not obeyed, then the
officers are at fault', he
growled. Then he had the
head of the harem executed.
The women screamed, and
t h e E m p e r o r w a s s a i d
something to the effect of
'Look here, old chap, that IS
my wife'. But after that, Sun
Tzu got instant obedience,
and the Emperor so impres-
s e d that he m a d e him
commander-in-chief. Lovely
people, are't they?
Of course, not all soldiers
write books. Some of them
have problems with writing
straightforward instructions.
It is of these heroes that
Norman F Dixon writes in 'On
the Psychology of Military
Incompetence', """his is not
quite the dry tone that you
might expect. T h e first part
covers several examples of
military disaster, and the
second sets out to relate the
f a i l i n g s of t h e o f f i c e r s
concerned to problems of
personality. The conclusions
and the suggestions offered
about causes and symptoms
of incompetence apply to
anyone w h o manages or
commands; not just soldiers.
Miss this one at your own risk.
CINEMA
Ghostbusters
Another typical, American,
'slapstick' comedy, with over
three heroes saving the whole
world, let alone New York,
from the psychic evils of the
underworld. A new Idea?
The action is well inter-
spersed with that popular
'clap-along' song fom Street
Cred Ray Parker Junior to
which those zany American
audiences actually clap. Not
a g a i n ! From b e h i n d this
b i z z a r e a n d c a p t i v a t i n g
fagacde, however, the same
old jokes are offered; but who
cares?
The special effect are good
producing incredibly cute
looking ghosts with great
taste in wine and European
cheeses. I would say,that the
scary monster scenes are
perhaps the funniest from a
good beginning, though, the
f i n a l e is j u s t a l i t t l e
too...'mega'...super...over-
done. The evil goddess having
an incredible likeness to
Sheena Easton from head to
toe in sparkling leotard. I
expected her to burst into
song at any instant.
'I ain't afraid of no ghost' but
so long as the sky does not fall
on our heads tomorrow life
goes on. Not a painful two
hours.
