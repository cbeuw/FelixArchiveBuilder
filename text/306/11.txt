Mr Dawson (no relation of the editor) is now to take over from Mr, Lewis
College security, and w i l l be in charge of a l l locks and keys...,so those of you
who have i l l i c i t ones had better lose them f a s t i J FELICITY also suggests that a
p r i o r i t y might be to change to Chubb or Ingersoll locks, which are f a r harder to
pick or obtain skeleton keys for than Assa, who hold the present monopoly*
It is reported that Trawler Hobaan has had nore birds this torn than
Dave Amos has had hot dinners.(Rumours that the former is on a diet of poultry
and the l a t t e r is on a diet of salads are completely unfounded). x
SUK is bursting into fantastic vocal action next January 18th, when the
"C. W. Post ( l e t ' s hope they're F i r s t Class) Chamber Singers" a l l the way from
the land of song, alias the USA., w i l l perform at the Great i U l l . Tickets (plug,
plug, and I said that I didn't do them) are £ l each in advance, or 75p at the
door (OAPs and Students 40p - no, i t ' s not a typing errorJI ) The high advance
prices are aimed at certain wealthier sectors of the local community, the lower
prices are intended to f i l l the h a l l when they discover that they've only sold
0 tickets at the f u l l price!I
Rumours that SUK have been given a £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 . o v e r d r a f t by t h e i r bankers are
tota11y unf o\mded,
Those who attended the last ICUGM w i l l remember that a certain Mr. Peter
Leppard (there's no spots on him) wrote a letter to Exec, threatening to take
legal action over the closure of the Union building during the recent London
Colleges' March, claiming the support and writing in the name of the Federation
of Conservative Students. It, however, transpires that Mr. Leppard is not a
member of I . C . Consociil - and is only a member of FCS through the grace of his
room-mate, who's got something to do with King's. lie has now written to IC C0X-.
soc saying that he w i l l no longer be taking any action, as he and the FCS have
no laoney* I FCS is financed d i r e c t l y from Conservative Party f u n d s , . . *8>o those
who are wondering why a l l those MP's have just got a pay rise may now have.a
c l u e , . . .
And while we're s t i l l conning you, you may be interested to know (and
you may not) that Mr. Loader, ConSoc pub. o f f . , is NOT in favour of a Registrar,
as are the rest of that motley gang (no, he's rot in favour of the proposals as
they stand either).

The FELICITY scout in the Union Executive party" scone reports a recent
event in Beit lounge when messrs. McLooge, Hobman, Amos and Darling were a
l i t t l e pissed. McLooge, normally an extremely sober gentleman, was seen dancing
around with a barrel of cider (the type with a tap) on his head.
Last Friday £70 of your money, cunningly disguised as bookshop p r o f i t s ,
was blown on a party, again attended by our readily-pissablc union exec. A
certain staff member in Geology, who is also Chairman of the Bookshop committer
one J . B. K n i l l , was so f a r gone that he went round introducing himself as T e n y
Scott (there i_s_ a vague resemblance). Not content with l i t e r a r y inebriation,''
your intrepid executive then prepared to set off. to a party at one of the .3tu-'e.:
Houses....but Dave Amos was unable to continue, as his lady friend collapsed :.\,
the scent of fresh a i r J ! Rumours that Trawler Hobman (or was i t Dredger???} r
i t there have not as yet been substantiated.
