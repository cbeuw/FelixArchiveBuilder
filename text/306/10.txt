STRAWBERRY
meets the people
On the evening of the 29th
November, Dave Amos, John
McCullough, John Sommers and
Dave Hobman all went to the
ULU Student Representative
Council to listen to William Van
Straubenzee, the Parliamentary
Under Secretary for Higher Edu-
cation. The atmosphere at the
start of the meeting was not
helped by Strawberry refusing
to address them until all the
non-University Colleges were
removed — no one left, although
there were definitely some non-
University peopie there.
After only five minutes the
meeting had to be stopped, and
the room emptied due to heck-
ling from a group of about 10-15
people. When it became appa-
rent that these people would
not leave, another room was
found, however, the people who
were so keen to disrupt the
meeting, refused to let Straw-
berry enter. Most of the dele-
gates then found themselves in
the inequitus position of having
to link arms and prevent fellow
students from physically assault-
ing a man who they themselves
disliked.
Unfortunately in the scuffle
that followed a large number
of delegates were shut outside
including Dave Amos and John
McCullough.
After all that you would have
thought that the Strawb would
have been worth listening to,
but he gave a wishy-washy,
middle of the road compromise,
apologise type of talk and all
through the questions gave the
impression that really he wants
to implement a Registrar (as
backed by the Federation of
Conservative Students). All the
time he kept giving reassur-
ances that we need not worry
about our clubs and societies
and that really we would only
do better by his implementing
these ideas.
It was a pity that the atmo-
sphere wasn't more open to
freer discussion, however it was
useful to speak to the man in
person.
MURDER
in the Great Hall
"Murder in the Cathedral" is
possibly the greatest English
play of this century — it is
without doubt the most impor-
tant Christian one. There is
little action in it, this has — in
the best classical tradition — all
taken place before the play and
what the audience sees in the
final culmination of years' of
past history, the top of an ice-
berg of follies and furies and is
thus as inevitable and essential
as death itself.
The reliance of the play in
the quality of the acting is there-
fore intensified because not
only must the themes be
worked out and Becket's deve-
lopment from man to martyr be
shown openly, but the audience
must have the opportunity to
appreciate Eliot's verse and feel
at the same time that the play
concerns every one of them
directly.
The chorus of women is es-
sential to the play like a Greek
chorus it explains the drama,
but also it is through the chorus
that the relationship between
audience and action is made.
Unfortunately, the chorus found
some difficulty in acting to-
gether as a homogeneous unit
—they seemed indeed to be
sacrificing dramatic effect in
order to keep time — a wise
precaution for when they had to
run amok, each member over-
come by horror and grief for
the future, the scene looked
rather like something out of the
Marat-Sade, not one hopes the
original intention.
Phil Rastell as Becket did
not have an easy task — it is
hard to be essential and self-
effacing at the same time and
on the whole he managed very
well indeed. He underplayed his
lines rather, which although
useful in the second part of
the play does not fit in with the
first part at all, because one
cannot then appreciate Becket's
transformation — his unimpor-
tance as a person and his re-
duction to martyr days before
he is actually killed.
Eliot did not entirely approve
of doubling the Knights and the
Tempters, but in this perform-
ance it worked well — mainly
because the four actors in-
volved were better than the
others. The second and fourth
tempters were especially fluent
and made Becket seem queru-
lous by comparison. The ideas
of the knights then justifying
the murder (which was by-the-by
more than a little overdone) on
one of those ghastly TV talk
shows was sheer genius — it
was almost as if Eliot had
foreseen the invention of the
medium. The danger, though,
with this presentation, was that
it was such fun — echoes of
Sharian humour all round —
that it was easy to forget just
how spacious were the argu
ments used.
The Great Hall is the sort of
place that lends itself to large-
scale tragedies — especially if
they can fill up the space pro-
perly as this one did. Whether
we like it or not Christianity in
volves us all in one way or
another, and it was interesting
to see just how forcefully a
performance of such a tragedy
can put across our involvement.

The Executive Members of
l.C. Ents. Committee have de-
cided that some sort of reply
is needed to answer the insinua-
tions being put about college
at present concerning the af-
fairs of the committee. We con-
sider that this publication is
the most suitable for expressing
our opinions as we trust that
you will reproduce this letter
accurately and legibly unlike a
certain amateur publication.
Firstly, we consider the
article published in 'Felix' dated
November 4th, to be ill-informed.
The Union Executive is not
'peeved' over the proposed
transfer of the hops, and the
arrangements have been settled
to everyone's satisfaction. As
to the previous concerts in the
Great hall, the overall balance
is favourable. It also might be
noted that we do not have a
grant, which necessitates our
taking some financial risks at
the beginning of the year. Un-
fortunately, some of these have
not lived up to our expectations,
although our financial position
before the robbery on 28th No-
vember was by no means as bad
as had been stated in C.E.F.E.
dated Monday, November 15th,
and had it not been for the rob-
bery, we would now be in the
black.
The business over the Felix
photographer was unfortunate,
and arose because we were not
informed of his wish to attend.
We hope that this does not
occur again.
Certain members of the Exe-
cutive of the Committee have
been the target for unfounded,
malicious insinuations in recent
weeks. It appears that these
insinuations originated from
people within the committee
who seem determined to under-
mine the morale of the com
mittee, and also people's faith
in the committee. As one might
expect from such people, no
specific allegations have been
made and until this occurs
none can be answered, although
of course, it remains to be said
that we consider these allega-
tions to be entirely groundless
It is interesting to note that
at the time of the robbery there
was more than £100 of non
Ents money in the safe, although
this was not touched when the
Ents. takings were stolen.
We hope that this has cleared
up some of the criticism of our
committee and should there be
any further concrete allegations
we would be pleased to answer
them to the best of our ability
Yours, etc.

Ents. Committee.

Round 12 of the NUS Debating
Competition for the Observer
Mace held in College Block,
mperial College, at 19.00 on
Tuesday, November 30th, 1971.
Motion
"This House believes that
socialism should be shot,
stuffed and put in the British
Museum as a monument to
human folly."
Judges
Mr. Philip Gibbons, Barrister;
Mr. John Thole, Lecturer and
Historian; Fr. Edward Cruise,
Chaplain.
Teams and Speakers
Pembroke College, Cambridge,
Richard Foster.
Imperial College, John Lumby
(Maths 3) and Paul Stevenson
(Civ. Eng. 2).
Philippa Fawcett College,
Anthony Hegarty and Terry
O'Donnell.
London Hospital Medical
School, James Lefanu and Miss
Sheilamary Barry.
Judging
The teams from Philippa
Fawcett and IC go through to
the Regional rounds, plus Mr.
Foster from Pembroke as an
outstanding individual.
The debate started nearly
half-an-hour late, due to the non-
arrival of a Pembroke competi-
tor and the London Hospital
Team getting lost, but nearly
40 people were still in the audi-
ence at 7.30.
Speeches from the speakers
were of a high standard, con-
sidering the difficult nature of
the motion.
Mr. Lumby and Mr. Stevenson
argued that whilst socialism
might have been a good idea, it
had turned out to be human
folly indeed. Their speeches
were well argued, easy to under-
stand and even amusing in parts,
though they were criticised by
the judges for perhaps preparing
too well, which led to a loss
of spontaneity and edge in
the speaking.
After some lively speeches
from the floor a vote was taken
of the motion defeated by 22
votes to 7, with 9 abstentions.
The judges then announced
their verdict and then retired
to the Ante-Room to consume
a rather fine buffet supper sup-
plied by Mr. Mooney (please
note!)
We wish our team every suc-
cess in the later stages of the
competition.
