Asked for. h i s advice to us, he s a i d -.hat we should prepare our own document,
and -negotiate. with the govemement on t h i s . He f e e l s that n e g o t i a t i o n i s es-
s e n t i a l , and that there should be some form of a c c o u n t a b i l i t y . Asked as to
whether the grant f o r unions should come from The UGC and i f so, whether i t
should be earmarked f o r union purposes, he thought t h a t i n the long run i t would
be b e t t e r not to be, as i t could be subjected to a'cut too e a s i l y . ,

E r n i e Roberts gave a- t y p i c a l trade u n i o n i s t speech, going on more about TU
autonomy than SUs. He s a i d that we faced the same f i g h t as the trade unions,
i . e . that of "contracting=in". Promising union support f o r us, he s a i d "Your
f i g h t i s our f i g h t and our f i g h t i s yours". "We must f i g h t against the gov-
ernment on every f r o n t " .
Then i t was Digby's turn - he proceeded to r e c i t e the usual NUS d o c t r i n e and
speech. He said that today's national•show of strength was the greatest by
unions f o r four or f i v e years. The f u t u r e of SUs ha.', been made a p o l i t i c a l
issue by the govt., and i f we d i s r e g a r d t h i s p o l i t i c a l aspect i t w i l l be to
our detriment. "We need the organised committment of students over a long
period"... and i t must continue a f t e r January 23rd (more overtime f o r f e l i c i t y ) .
Miss Anne Ward, a prospective candidate f o r a London borough, was next....
"God help SUs i f they're ever l e f t to L o c a l A u t h o r i t i e s " was her l i n e , and rhe
l i k e n e d our f i g h t to that of f r e e m i l k f o r s c h o o l c h i l d r e n . She s a i d that Mrs.
T. was morelike a b r i c k w a l l than anybody she had ever met, and that i t was no
use t h i n k i n g any s t r i k e s would change her r i n d - " t a c t i c s of d i s r u p t i o n w i l l not
succeed on t h e i r own". The only answer i s to remove Mrs T. -as a cabinet m i n i s t e r .
The f i n a l speaker,.Nick Raynsworth, r a i s e d a few laughs with h i s expose of what
x the finances of h i s c o l l e g e union (Chelsea A r t ) would be i f the govt, proposals
x as they stand were implemented. I t appears that they would ha\r
e'aii-^—SSe^-a year

badly s u f f e r or cease t o e x i s t i f the plans go through - as Digby s a i d , U n i v e r s i t y
unions stand a f a r b e t t e r chance of s u r v i v i n g .

Was the day a success or not? W e l l , i t ' s not my p o s i t i o n t o say, and only time
can t e l l . As a r e l a t i v e l y outsid.e observer, I can say that i t may not have been
very impressive t o any of the p u b l i c who r e a l i s e d :what was giong o n . . . i t may not
be g o o d . p u b l i c i t y , hut LSE had crowds outside the door, chanting, banners, et a l ,
which i s more than IC had. I t ' s doubly unfortunate that many students, although
they d i d not attend l e c t u r e s , regarded the day as a good excuse f o r a l i e - i n . . . .
at many h a l l s and houses some were seen not he g e t t i n g up u n t i l 2p.m. The meet-
i n g i n the great h a l l only a t t r a c t e d about 650. although i t was f o r the whole of
USK....only two c o l l e g e s brought along contingents bl any si2m....and that number
looked r a t h e r sparse i n the h a l l ! I The only actionat the p i c k e t s was a group of
12 f a s c i s t aggro merchants who marched on Chemis' «y .... a l l t h a t was missing
was the chant of "Land of Hope and Glory"!;:
iText round, i s the demo and etc. on Sunday, 23rd January, which, l e t ' s hope, w i l l
he even b e t t e r f o r our cause. The Liason Committee f o r the Defence of Student
