WHAT A
SCORCHER
T h e D a v e A m o s S h o w A r r i v e s i n T o w n
This meeting was held
in ME 220, and conse-
qently it was not surprising
that no one took it very
seriously. After all, this
location has been asso-
ciated with C and G union
meetings for some time,
these being on a consider-
ably lighter note! How-
ever, for once, there were
some important items on
the agenda and Dave
Amos could be excused
for his annoyance at the
people who were throwing
various objects (chalk and
paper darts) in his gene-
ral direction. Once or
twice, though, he sounded
remarkably like a crotchety
old school teacher trying
to keep her class under
control.
Community Action
Eventually b u s i n e s s
ground to a start after
several attempts, with the
first item being that of a
proposed new constitution
for the Community Action
group. This is a very worth-
while project but the main
aims seemed to get lost
in the mass of argument
as to whether the group
should be a sub-committee
of a sub-committee or a
sub-committee of ICU
council. The general points
were that:—
(i) There should be a
committee of eleven;
(ii) The c h a i r m a n
should be elected at the
ICU general meeting in
Spring;
(iii) Two ordinary mem-
bers of ICU should be
elected annually;
(iv) The committee re-
ports directly to the ICU
council.
This and the necessary
amendments to ICU bye-
laws was passed by a
large majority.
Discipline
As was mentioned at the
meeting, this document is
a compromise, but it ap-
pears as though it may
work. There is some room
for doubt, however, in
paragraph 17 which im-
plies that prosecution in
an outside court may re-
sult in further punishment
by the Discipline/Discipli-
nary Appeals committee (a
copy of the whole paper
can be obtained at
Union Office).
The document was
finally approved but not by
a very large majority. This
could either have been due
to lack of support or lack
of understanding which is
much more likely. After all,
what chance is there of
being able to absorb a
fairly complex document in
five minutes? Again that
feeling of 'fait accompli'
hangs in the air.
NUS Conference
The little red sheet said:
This is your opportunity
to question and criticise
the delegates on their ac-
tions.' Most p e o p l e
seemed more concerned
with how Piers Corbyn
managed to get himself
called 'the President of
ICU' in the Daily Tele-
graph. His somewhat non-
committal answer to this,
'Their ,files must be out
of date' raised a few
laughs. In fact, he spoke at
the conference on Unem-
ployment and Union Auto-
nomy and it would have
been much more interest-
ing to hear about what he
said in the name of Im-
perial College students!
For more details see the
article on NUS Confer-
ence.
Union Autonomy
This was the last and
most complicated item to
be discussed. In brief,
there was the two separate
motions to be discussed,
both saying what should
happen on December 8th.
One was written by ICU
Executive and the other
(printed in red) by, guess
who, Piers Corbyn!
Piers' motion was much
more militant and in direct
conflict with the NUS
ruling on the subject, in
that he advocated the en-
forcing of the boycott
planned on lectures and
the occupation of col-
lege block on Wednesday
afternoon.
Eventually, after much
confusion, a mixture of the
two motions was passed
with the much more level-
headed executive motion
making up the bulk. The
main points being:
(i) Public statement by
the Rector against the
Green Paper.
(ii) Full support for
NUS motion.
(iii) Boycott of lectures
and laboratories on De-
cember 8th, with picket
lines to encourage sup-
port.
Bureaucracy Triumphs
Again
I know that some formal
debating rules must be
retained, but surely some-
thing could be done about
the mass of petty restric-
tions which bog down
every Union meeting?
(Please).
U S K E n t s . C o n c e r t
WISHBONE SMASH
What a pampered life a Felix writer
leads to be sure! All these concerts to be
reviewed, and all of them free. Actually
the USK Rag Concert at the Lyceum was
the first to which my admission price as
a Felix rep. was, shall we say, slightly
reduced. Otherwise I should not have
come at all because having seen Wish-
bone Ash three weeks previously when
they were made to look sterile and ama-
teurish by Mountain, I was reluctant to
pay to subject myself to further agony.
You may then gather that I was prepar-
ing to write a thoroughly damning review
of this concert, accusing the group of
being Britain's Grand Funk Railroad, re-
peating riffs ad nauseam, and only
making it due to the perverse enthusiasms
of certain influential rock writers, just to
show everyone who thinks I can only
write good reviews that I can write bad
ones occasionally. To my incalculable
disappointment I quite enjoyed them. It
might be that the group plays better in
a smaller venue, perhaps, or that they
play better when not playing second
fiddle to the world's greatest rock band
(just an opinion) or just that that was
a bad gig and this was a good one. What-
ever the reason, I'm afraid it's another
patronising "Yes—but" review, folks, but
just wait and see, one of these days I'll
get my hands on something really lousy.
The show was opened by Philip Good-
hand-Tait who played some nice, wistful
songs; he really is like Elton John; I
know that has been said hundreds of
times before, and I wish I could say
something else, but as far as I can see
the only difference was that Goodhand-
Tait didn't take his trousers off and play
rock 'n roll. He was just nice, that's all.
Renaissance followed, and they were
surprisingly good. It might be surprising
to some that such a little-known group
has such an original sound, but this group,
with the amplified piano which really
sounded like a grand and not more like
a Jamaican steel band, and those soaring
vocal harmonies, can make that claim.
They don't just play "poofter" music,
though, and for the last two numbers,
when at one time all the members of the
group picked up some sort of percussion
instrument and the guitarist was given
some space, they really got it on. The
drummer looks and plays like Ginger
Baker, too, which should add to their
mass appeal. Some people even clapped
along with the music, although it seemed
that the majority were too busy swigging
beer to pay much attention. The interested
few did call the group back for a well
deserved encore.
Wishbone Ash's act centred around
their highly successful "Pilgrimage"
album. They opened with two rockers,
"Vas Dis" and "Jailbait", which got the
crowd adequately interested. Then fol-
lowed the only bum song, "The Pilgrim",
which was unbelievably repititious, and
made me think that I might have been
right the first time. This is a great pity,
because the actual sound of the song
is quite evocative of a jolly old Pilgrim
setting out, full of hope, on a bright sunny
morning (with a bit of imagination) and
the song could have been improved im-
measurably with a bit of variety. "Phoe-
nix" from the first album, has had that
treatment and for me was the highlight
of the act, owing nothing to the current
"heavy rock" format, brilliantly evocative
again and featuring Ted Turner on guitar.
It was long, too, about 20 minutes, and
' not many groups can play for that long
these days without getting boring. With
a few more numbers like this, and less
like "The Pilgrim", Wishbone will justify
their "Brightest Hope" rating with no
trouble at all. The audience, predictably,
loved it, and by the penultimate number
"Where were you tomorrow", the Lyceum
was a mass of gyrating bodies. This was
guitarist Andy Powell's piece, and at one
stage, after racing about the stage for
several minutes, he leapt into the crowd.
Yes, I could almost say they were exciting
and I hope more of their gigs are like
this than like the gig they played with
Mountain. I'm now inclined to believe
that one was the exception rather than
the rule.
Compliments of the Season, record
fans.
