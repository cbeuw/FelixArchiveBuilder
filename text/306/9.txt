Ist VIII Win.U.L.
Winter Vlll's
l.C. Boat Club made
their first appearance to
the season at the U.L. Win-
ter Vlll's regatta, and
notched up their first vic-
tory, when the 1st VIII won
the Winter Vlll's Cup in the
Open Division.
The competition held at
the U.L. Boat House is a
London colleges affair
with representatives from
most of the college Boat
Clubs. The races are di-
vided up into Novice,
Junior and Open divisions,
rowed over a course of
just over half a mile from
above U.L. boathouse to
the 'Ship' beyond Chis-
wick Bridge. The river
was relatively placid for a
November day, and with
various divisions, some
success was assured.
The Open Division had
three l.C. crews in it, the
1st and 2nd Vlll's and a
3rd VIII containing four
Purple trialists. The first
round was a little unfortu-
nate, as due to a misunder-
standing over the time of
the race, Wye College did
not appear for their first
race against the 2nd VIII,
who were subsequently
rowed against the 1st VIII
and London Hospital. The
1st VIII beat London Hospi-
tal and predictably beat
the 2nd VIII. In the other
heat the 3rd VIII beat St.
Barts. Hospital comfort-
ably, but lost in the semi-
final to St. Mary's Hospi-
tal. The 1st VIII in their
semi-final beat Wye Col-
lege easily to reach the
final against St. Mary's and
U.C. This proved an ex-
acting race with l.C. row-
ing off at forty-four and
just creeping ahead of
U.C. they rowed over at
thirty-seven and spurted
home at thirty-nine, three-
quarter length up on U.C.
with St. Mary's in 3rd posi-
tion. The crew consisted
of: (Bow) B. J . McDouall,
J. C. Nicholls, P. E. Row-
ley, A. Azzaro, W. S. Kwiat-
kowski, A. Hill, T. S. Hoo-
ton, A. P. Chippendale
(str.), P. Clarke (cox).
In the junior Division
both l.C. crews got
through the first round.
The 4th XIII rowed over
after Guys scratched, and
the Lightweight VIII beat
Birkbeck College by 1£
lengths. These two crews
met St. Thomas's Hospital
in the final, and St.
Thomas's, a powerful and
well disciplined crew, with
several Henley oarsmen,
proved their worth by beat-
ing the 4th VIII by H
lengths and leaving the
Lightweight crew slightly
flustered in 3rd position.
Thanks to all the crews
and coaches for a good
effort.

With only a couple of league games remaining this
term, the strength of the separate teams are now emerg-
ing. The 1st and 2nd XI are both still unbeaten and
both have the ability to win their respective leagues.
The 3rd XI, having won their last three games, look
to have the skill to maintain a very respectable league
position. The 4th XI maintain an excellent team spirit
and also an unbeaten record, but several points have
slipped away in their last three drawn games. The 5th
XI have at last broken their duck by taking a point off
QEC II, but there is no holding the 5th XI. Under
their captain Tony Ranger (who has scored 17 goals out
of 32 this season) they have a tremendous team spirit
and an excellent record. The 7th XI must be congratu-
lated on their return to winning ways and also on their
enthusiasm in the face of annoying late team changes
— from which they normally suffer most. Today (Wed-
nesday, 1st December) marked the first defeat for the
1st and 2nd Xl's against Lanchester College. Fortu-
nately both were "friendlies". The 1st defeat was due
more to a wrong frame of mind than a lack of ability
and the 2nd XI fielded a much depleted team. Last
Saturday marked the embarkation on the annual U.L.
cup competitions. The 1st XI, 4th XI and 5th XI having
tough games against Kings I, L.S.E. Ill and Chelsea II
respectively. However, with a bit of luck, we hope to
see 7 l.C. teams in the draw on Monday. Any sup-
porters would be welcome as we would like to see a
repeat of last year's feat of winning all three cup com-
petitions.

l.C. Ladies played in the 1st round of the U.L.U. cup
at Kings ground on a very cold, misty Wednesday after-
noon. In this, our first match with two umpires, we
found Kings to be an excellent team and the pressure
was soon on. Both teams began shakily in defence,
but this was no detraction from the hard-working for-
wards who made many good moves. Chris Culshaw
took the ball on the left wing mid way through the 1st
half moved into and then across the circle and finally
pushed the ball past the G.K. for our 1st goal.
During the second half, the same gruelling pattern of
play continued until Chris Culshaw managed to get our
second goal, almost putting their G.K. in the net at well.
We managed to hold on to this 2-0 lead and so go
through to the next round of the Cup.
Wednesday, the 10th
November was a very sad
day for the Badminton
Club. This marked the de-
feat of the Men's I team by
Northern Poly 6-3, their
first defeat in over two
years. It was all the more
ignominious since they
had beaten N.P. 6-3 in the
U.L.U. Cup in the previous
week, and then went on to
beat them in the return
league match 7-2. They
also thrashed Oxford Uni-
versity II 17-2 (with a little
help from the ladies!) and
beat U.C. 8-1 to reach the
semi-finals of the U.L.U.
cup.
The Men's II team is al-
ready well on the way to
the 2nd division title, com-
prehensively winning their
first six games. A glance
at the table would lead
one to believe the 1st and
2nd teams should inter-
change; unfortunately, the
captain does not agree.
The 3rd and 4th teams
are suffering through lack
of fixtures, and, after a
shaky start, have re-
covered and should be
well placed in their divi-
sions by the end of the
season. The ladies have
also had a rather erratic
start, but they are at least
managing to field full
teams, always a problem
for them.
On the whole then we've
shown that the badminton
at l.C. is of exceptionally
high standard and we in-
tend to prove it by beating
both Oxford and Cam-
bridge 1st teams next
term. S. Sanderson

Rugby
And now for a report on
the backbone of the l.C.
Rugby Club, the A T s or
as it has been in recent
weeks the 'A' team. These
are the people who turn up
each week to find them-
selves drawn upon by the
Ex. 1st and generally re-
shuffled, but it says much
for the spirit of the players
in that this term we have
played with an ever-
varying side and yet have
still been quite successful.
In recent weeks we have
had good wins against
St. Albans and Southall
Tech., the first of these
victories being a good
example of continual hard
work by the forwards,
capitalised on by the
backs. And then there was
London Welsh. Andy Goze-
isiak played well in this
game, as referee, but I be-
gan to doubt his mathema-
tical ability (maybe I'm
biased).
The A1's consist of the
freshers adjusting them-
selves to club rugby, prob-
ably poised for honours in
the Ex. 1st and 1st teams
in future seasons, and they
are held together by the
old lags who just enjoy the
game.
The half-back combina-
tion of Mike Agg and Noel
Stack never ceases to
amaze at its effectiveness.
Nick Tomlinson has carved
his niche at full-back and
Editorial
Again, yesterday, it was hoped that all sports fixtures
would be cancelled in order to support the National Day
of Action. It will come as a relief to most club captains
and fixtures secretaries to hear that this is to be the last
blanket cancellation. With a bad winter being forecast
by the long range weathermen, clubs having good runs
in the cup and league will need every available date in
which to complete their fixture list.
Results so far have been encouraging, with the pos-
sible exception of the Rugby 1st XV. Their rugby has
been unable to match their dashing writing for FELIX,
although most of the games they have lost, have been
by a narrow margin. This does not encourage their
supporters in their bid to regain the Gutteridge Cup for
which the first round was played last week, when l.C.
were victorious.
The arrogance and complacency of the Badminton
Club could well have been a cause of the Mens I team
suffering its first defeat for more than two seasons —
perhaps George can now take off the black arm band
he has been wearing.
The Football Club as a whole has started remarkably
well, and it is to be hoped that this continues in their
bid to retain the various cups. Supporters will be very
welcome at Harlington to give encouragement in the
expected long run cup. The Rugby Club can attract
a reasonable crowd but the Football Club seems un-
able to match this.
The Boat Club are to be congratulated in fielding
eight crews in the Winter Vlll's Cup in which the top
open division was won by the l.C. 1st VIII.
The Ladies Hockey after a tough match succeeded
in getting into the 2nd round draw of the cup.
place-kicker, while Rich
Lester has proved to be a
powerful winger as has
Paul McCartney. The
three-quarters are well
represented by Rich (fit-
ness) Jones, Dave Thorne
and John Rosser, who is
also a forceful back-row
player. Talking of back-
rows you can't do much
better than Derek Watts
and Tony Walton as wing-
forwards. Then the faithful
old lags like Colin Fletcher
(who provides our only
supporter), John Marklew,
Nick Wilkinson, Andy Gry-
eisiak, Rob Powell and
Pete Bowall, the last lag
being held up admirably in
screams by props Derek
Shackleton and R. Bed-
does.
