REVIEWS
There was an air of uncer-
tainty in the audience at the
beginning of the stunning
"Godspell" (Roundhouse)
when I saw it. By the end,
when the broken form of Jesus
has been carried round trium-
phantly from its crucifixion by
his disciples, our hands were
raw with applause. The idea
of a baby-faced, baggy-
trousered Christ preaching to,
and with a cast of eight clown-
figures in a musical interpre-
tation of St. Matthew's Gospel
does not sound likely to be
anything but garish and crude,
but it really does work. The
parables and stories are per-
formed in an extraordinary
variety of forms — ventrilo-
quist's doll, goon voices, glove
show, tap dance, mime, cha-
rade and these fresh ap-
proaches combined with
Christ's serious talk, force un-
derstanding on to the audi-
ence. The use of clowns is
entirely validated, for the
clown, with his humour, sad-
ness and ultimate tragedy is a
symbol of humanity, and it is
the humanity of Christ that is
emphasised in the production.
The joy of the cast and audi-
ence is only occasionally over-
shadowed by a foretaste of
the Passion, such as when
John the Baptist swings
round on Christ with a ques-
tion at a moment when Christ's
arms are open. They stop.
Think: Crucifixion.
Many of the critics have
called " G o d s p e l l " too simplis-
tic, but its simplicity arises
out of the inherent lack of
complication in the basic
Christian Message. I cannot
hope to convey my enthusiasm
P L A Y S
for this challenging show with
its sincere and joyous cast
(David Essex is Christ, but
they are all very good) and
fitting music. Go and behold.
Chalk Farm tube, turn right.
The Theatre of all Possibili-
ties have now left London, but
I think they are still worth a
mention. This group of actors
is a part of a community ex-
ploring the possibilities of
Biotechnic Ecological com-
munes in New Mexico and
New South Wales. Their act-
ing is a part of this process
for their plays are about the
mistake and the hope of civi-
lised man. Their "Faust" uses
the legend's framework to
show the tragedy of Western
Civilisation, though without
Marguerite's heavenly choirs.
They seek to provide the
answer in the energetic "Mc
Neckels' Commune", showing
a new institution in continual
revolt against itself. Fair
enough. But the really inter-
esting thing about these people
is the acting style that they
have developed. This com-
bines the classic Eastern ap-
proach of full use of the actor's
body with normal Western
rhetoric, and it's effect is a
challenge to our sterilized Wes-
tern Theatre.
There are really two plays
in Peter Nicholl's "The Na-
tional Health" (Old V i c ) . The
major one follows the everyday
life of a Ward in a bleak Vic-
torian hospital, complete with
nurses, over-worked doctors,
condescending visitors and ter-
rifying ly real patients. Ward-
life is depicted exactly (so
my Medical Student sister tells
me) as patients arrive, joke,
suffer, argue, play Monopoly,
get potted and eventually leave
vertically or horizontally.
The other play happens in
episodes, in the best traditions
of the medical soap opera it
parodies. Neil, a doctor (white)
falls in love with Nurse Norton
(coloured), though his doctor-
father (complete with High-
lands accent) objects to their
marriage. Neil has to have a
kidney transplant, Nurse Nor-
ton is the donor. Dad performs
the operation ("Any nurse
could give him her heart, only
Norton could give him a kid-
ney", lauds a Sister), relents,
and everyone lives happily
ever after.
The real success of the play
comes from the way in which
fact and fantasy are inter-
mingled. Jim Dale plays Bar-
net, the orderly, who fills the
real world with affected hearti-
ness and provides the avid
commentary on the celluloid
Norton affair. Occasionally he
even steps out of the play, like
the Common Man in " A Man
For All Seasons", so as to
speak direct to the audience.
Continuity is greatly helped
by Marc Wilkinson's music
which has just enough of "Dr.
Kildare" and "Dr. Finlay" to be
recognisable. Nicholl's direc-
tor is the Michael Blakemore of
his earlier " J o e E g g " and his
later "Forget-Me-Not-Lane"
(see Last Felix) —• suffice it
to say that here is a Director-
Writer partnership that is un-
likely to be bettered. 10p buys
a ticket at the Old Vic. That
is good value.

By the time you read this
the 15th London Film Festival
will have finished. Luckily more
than half the films have ob-
tained a distributor in the U.K.
so if you were unable to see
the films at the festival you
ought to be able to see many
of the films soon (in fact two
festival films: " T h e Hired
H a n d " and " W . R . Mysteries of
the Organism" have already
been released), the main ex-
ception is Andy Warhol's
" T r a s h " which won't get a cer-
tificate for a very long time.
This year's London Film Festi-
val showed over forty films,
and I shall be taking a look
at these and Richard Lewis,
Filmsoc. Treasurer, has written
a review of "Punishment Park".
Also to be included is my re-
view of Frank Zappa's "200
Motels".
Let's get the rubbish dis-
posed of first of all. Frank
Zappa's "200 Motels" is a very
bad film. It is a mixture of
gimmicky technical tricks and
nothing much else. The film is
a look at the life of a rock
group on the road and how
it drives them mad: at times
this came over quite well, and
at times the film was very
funny (an operatic aria about
penises) but overall the tech-
nical gimmickry was tiring, the
sound quality bad and the film
itself was pointless.
Many thanks to Richard
Lewis for submitting a review
of Peter Watkin's latest film
"Punishment Park".
Also at the London Film Fes-
tival, Peter Watkin's latest film
"Punishment P a r k " is a
pseudo-documentary much as
his earlier film "The War
G a m e " . The latter showed
Britain under nuclear attack
and its aftermath, "Punishment
Park" documents how the
American Government could
suppress young political ex-
tremists under current legisla-
tion. The "reporters" take their
cameras into a tent near
Punishment Park, where the
prisoners are being given a
one-sided trial ending in a
choice between a long prison
sentence or three days in
Punishment Park.
Needless to say the prison-
ers choose Punishment Park.
The cameras follow them as
they struggle across 50 miles
of desert without food or
water, pursued by soldiers, to
witness their final massacre.
Authentic, gripping, shocking,
this is a film really worthwhile
seeing.
I only managed to see two
films at the Film Festival, "Two-
lane Blacktop" and " W . U . S . A . "
Taking Monte Hellman's
"Two-lane Blacktop" first. The
film concerns two street racers
the driver, James Taylor (yes,
the James Taylor) and the
mechanic, Dennis Wilson, who
race for money. They leave
Los Angeles after winning a
drag race and on the way to
Santa Fe they pick up a girl
—they cruise on to win more
races then meet and challenge
G.T.O. (Warren Oates) to a
race at Washington D.C., the
loser forfeiting his car, there
follows a race which is not
very exciting, but all through
the film the relationship be-
tween the girl and the three
men keeps on changing the
course of the race. I didn't
really like the film, it was very
slow; the film didn't have the
visual appeal of "Easy Rider".
And now for the best film
I've seen for some time, Stuart
Rosenberg's W.U.S.A. The
film is about Rheinhardt (Paul
Newman), a drifter who drinks
too much, works too little, and
thinks too much, who works
for an ultra-conservative radio
station (W.U.S.A.) in New Or-
leans. The story is a little
too complicated to give in
a synopsis form, but the story
is very thought provoking, and
gives a terrifying look at a
potential fascist conspiracy
that fails in the U S A , the whole
film has a fine tinge of rea-
lity. Paul Newman as the
cynical hero; Joanne Wood-
ward as the hooker whom
Rheinhardt destroys and A n -
thony Perkins as Rainey, the
man who is initially used by
W.U.S.A. and is finally killed
trying to kill one of the leaders
of the conspiracy: are all ex-
cellent. The film itself is very
good, Rosenberg has obtained
fine performances from all
the people involved, and he
has directed a very good film
which is worth seeing when it
is released.
I can't see any potentially
good films due for release in
the next four or five weeks,
but I'm sure I can see some
good films to tell you about
in the next issue of Felix.
Happy Christmas everyone.
FRANK ZAPPA ETC., "200
MOTELS" (U.A.)
I've only been left a small
space to review this record,
due to a large film review,
which is a pity as I could write
a whole book on it. The album
is of considerable interest in
its own right, and listening
to it gives a good idea of what
goes on in the film, although
to be honest Zappa has done
some far better things. The
Royal Philharmonic Orchestra
is used to good effect through-
out, but just as a beautiful
orchestral passage gets under
way it is cut short by a com-
ment like "What the f
is that?" which tends to spoil
things. The standard of play-
ing by the Mothers is again
high, but this album would
appeal more to devotees of
"Freak Out" than those of
"Hot Rats".
CHICAGO "LIVE AT THE CAR-
NEGIE HALL" (CBS)
This album has, I'm afraid,
a whole stack of disadvan-
tages before it even gets lis-
tened to. It is a quadruple
album set, complete with two
monster posters and your very
own full colour Chicago book,
D I S C S
costing £6.49, and while this
is indisputably good value,
six quid is a lot to fork out.
Even the dedicated Chicago
freaks who do buy the album
will find that the great majo-
rity of the tracks have ap-
peared on the group's three
previous albums and only the
very dedicated Chicago freaks
will consider that these ver-
sions of songs they already
have are worth buying.. A n d
while the album might stand
as a "Best of C h i c a g o " it
doesn't, because the produc-
tion doesn't live up to such
a title, being only average as
live recordings go for most of
the album, while on the group's
most famous tracks "25 or 6
to 4 " and "I'm a M a n " , the
balance is awful.
The musical ability of the
group has never been in
doubt, of course. They are cer-
tainly the world's forerunners
in "brass-rock" and in terms
of sheer excitement, both on
record and on stage, they can
knock "rivals" Blood Sweat
and Tears into the proverbial
cocked hat. Their chief dis-
advantage has been the ten-
dency to venture into pseudo-
polemics: " W e gotta change
the system, brothers and sis-
ters", and these dated cliches
are much in evidence, reach-
ing a nauseous nadir on " A
Song for Richard and His
Friends" which is, and I
quote, " A kinda wishful thought
wishing President Nixon would
quit", but of course with no
suggestion as to who should
take his place. Ugh.
However, if you either en-
joy or can ignore such ban-
alities there are plenty (by the
law of averages?) of musical
highlights. The horns on
"Mother", the flute on "It
Better End S o o n " , the guitar on
"South California Purples" and,
best of all, the piano intro to
"Does Anybody Really K n o w "
are of particular interest. But
it still seems a shame to have
to pad these out on to four
albums with a lot of songs not
very different in arrangement
from the original studio ver-
sions. Chicago may claim to
be anti-capitalism, but who the
hell other than capitalists can
afford this thing?
