E d i t o r i a l
Welcome to the 10 page Christmas issue of Felix.
I hope that having got this for you, you consider it to
have been worth waiting an extra week for and if you
do, then Felix and all the staff who produce her would
like to wish you a merry Christmas and a prosperous
(not much chance on a grant) New Year.
Being the season of goodwill I have been a little
distressed by the reports that have reached me of
Carnival's successes so far, or should I say lack of
them. The concert at the Lyceum last week could well
have lost around £300 due to its bad attendance and
this is no isolated example of IC failing in its efforts
to raise money for charity. Every year, we make a very
small amount for our Carnival in proportion to the size
of our college and every year the blame immediately
falls on the shoulders of the rag committee. The ques-
tion is, are they really deserving of the blame?
It is perhaps true to say that the members of the
rag committee are a little inexperienced and perhaps
some of their ideas have lacked the organisational bril-
liance they might have had, or perhaps they have just
lacked the brilliance. Whatever one thinks of the efforts
of the rag committee, it cannot be denied that they are
facing a major problem. IC apathy in its crudest form.
A concert such as the one at the Lyceum last week was
good value at 60p, even if the profits had been lining
the pockets of some grotty company, but they weren't.
They were going to charity to help people in need and
it wouldn't have hurt anyone just to give 60p and get
nothing in return. You were offered entertainment for
your money and most of you still failed to go. So what
chance do our rag committee have in future if this is
the kind of response it gets at present.
Don't criticise the rag committee, don't even eat your
meals with an easy conscience until you personally
have done something to help Carnival. If you are really
broke and can't afford to give money give some of your
time or ideas, but don't be apathetic.

Sir,
'Regularly our telephone rings
and it is a journalist from a
newspaper or magazine who has
suddenly made the epoch-mak-
ing discovery that in this coun-
try there is an unprecedented
interest in wine and wine-making
and they are bursting with
eagerness to write an article or
feature about it."
This was the opening sen-
tence of the editorial of the
October issue of 'Winemaker'
magazine, and like all the best
national dailies and glossy
magazines, FELIX is no excep-
tion. Also, like all the other
such accounts that I have read,
the Felix edition had its short-
comings.
The author did however speak
from experience and emphasis-
ed points as the time required,
simplicity and the possible prob-
lems arising. I intend to try to
correct notions spoiling an
otherwise readable article. At
the same time I will avoid in-
cluding any superfluous techni-
cal detail.
Equipment wise, I will point
out that most metals will dis-
solve in the must and give rise
to a horrible 'tinny' flavour.
Whilst enamel is safe in itself
it could be disastrous if scratch-
ed or dented and I would recom-
mend the use of a plastic
bucket.
The ingredients play the most
important part in determining the
type and quality of the finished
wine. Most certainly mouldy
fruits should be discarded, al-
though there is a group of wine-
makers who delight in using odd
ingredients.
Each type of ingredient has a
method of treatment which best
suits it. Vegetables are best
boiled, as described in the ar-
ticle, but the fragrant oils pre-
sent in flowers would be dissi-
pated if boiling water were pour-
ed over them. It would be better
if 2-4 pints of the flowers were
soaked in COLD water for 2-4
days.
Short of pressing out the
juice, most fruits should be
treated in this way, but it would
benefit from about 7 days on
the pulp. All fruits and vege-
tables should be chopped into
smaller pieces before proces-
sing.
I should add that the yeast
and sugar should be added at
this stage in order that the yeast
has as much time as possible
to breed.
There are many different
yeasts and they all have differ-
ent effects. The most common
English wild yeast is only cap-
able of fermenting up to 4%.
alcohol by volume. Bakers yeast
is not the strongest and brewers
yeast imparts a 'beery' flavour
to the wine and since a wine
yeast can be bought just as
easily, it makes sense to use it.
Virtually all the alcohol pre-
sent in a home-made wine is
produced from the sugar added.
However, yeast produces alcohol
more and more slowly as the
alcohol content increases until
it finally stops when the yeast
has reached its 'alcohol toler-
ance.' All the remaining sugar
just makes the wine sweeter. In
fact 2 lbs. sugar per gallon will
give a dry wine of about 12%
alcohol and 3 lbs. sugar per
gallon will give about 19%
alcohol which is about the
maximum you can expect under
normal conditions. Hence 4 lbs.
sugar per gallon should produce
a sweet wine. Any subsequent
sugar additions would start slow
fermentation, but this would not
increase the alcohol content
appreciably.
Last is the most interesting
part of a wine and that brings
me back to ingredients. The
taste is a balance of flavour;
bouquet, alcohol, sugar, acids
and tannin. Sufficient acids pre-
vent the wine from tasting in-
sipid. If the other ingredients in
a recipe lack sufficient acids,
these may be included as chemi-
cal additives. This might put a
beginner off the recipe, but I
should not shy from such re-
cipes once you have gained a
little experience, in fact they
should produce a well balanced
wine. The presence of sufficient
acid also prevents the growth
of hostile bacteria but does not
harm the yeast.
If your wine doesn't taste a
little unpleasant immediately
after it has finished fermenting
—there is something wrong.
However, after about 6 months,
it should taste palatable and will
usually continue to improve for
at least 3 years. Red wines and
vegetable wines will take cor-
respondingly longer to mature
and could be avoided by the
beginner.
I would like to finish by mak-
ing two remarks. Firstly, if the
preceding discussion interested
you, the book 'Progressive Wine-
making' by Peter Duncan and
Bryan Acton (75p) furthers the
subject. If I have frightened you
from starting then the books
'Making Wines Like Those You
Buy' (30p) by the same authors
or 'Recipes for Prize-Winning
Wines' (30p) by Bryan Acton
contain recipes designed with
all the above points in mind. All
three books are published by
the 'Amateur Winemaker'.
Secondly, discreet enquiries
about the recipe for 'loadern-
berry' wine show that it is a
trade secret but rumour has it
that its principal ingredient is
—wait for it—'BLAE-berries.'
Yours,
IAN D. FERGUSON

Dear
Dear Sir,
Surely it is time to put an end
to this stupid and childish prac-
tice of stringing together a lot of
'Lunchtime' names to make a
so-called joke.
Yours at length,

Dear Editor,
I noted with interest the ap-
parent surprise with which
'Felicity' commented that very
few women had participated in
the march on Wednesday last.
Two points had perhaps es-
caped the writer's notice.
The first of these concerns the
l.C. Union meeting at which
I.C.U. rejected a motion to allow
women into the Union Bar dur-
ing all opening hours.
The second point concerns
the following Union meeting at
which the question of action
against the D.E.S. Green Paper
was first raised. One criticism
of the proposed Government
action was that it unfairly pun-
ished all Student Unions for the
undemocratic action of one or
two in withholding funds from
certain policital clubs, the
speakers concerned pointing out
that the vast majority of Stu-
dents Unions, including I.C.U.
did not discriminate against any
groups of people with regard to
Funds or Facilities.
I fail to see how the women
of Imperial College can be ex-
pected to participate in action
to perpetuate their 'democra-
tic' Students Union in its pre-
sent form, when they are exclu-
ded from what should be a
focal point of its facilities, ex-
cept on Sundays. I should have
liked to raise this point at the
second of these Union meetings,
but due to lack of time, only a
very limited number of people
were allowed to speak.
Yours faithfully,
GILLIAN BOND,
Mat. Sci. II
Sir,
Having read the anonymous
editorial (can you find more than
'Tony'?) in the current issue of
RCS Broadsheet I wonder whe-
ther the time has arrived to
halt the constant, childish and
petty contentions between the
various Union publications.
However, I would also take this
opportunity to explain the pre-
sent circulation policy of
FELIX.
This term, in addition to pro-
viding FELIX FREE, our print
order has been increased from
its previous minimum of 1,200 to
a new, constant level of 2,000. I
note, with pride, the rapid dis-
appearance of these 2,000 fol-
lowing distribution.
At the beginning of term we
decided to circulate FELIX to
every student-house and hall
resident. This has now been
established as an advertising
commitment. The remaining 900
copies are distributed through-
out college, approximately 100
being left on each of the de-
partment stands (according to
departmental size). Thus one
issue is available for every two
members of the student popula-
tion.
In closing I would like to
agree with the comment in
RCSB, regarding . . . APATHY.
The 'select band of FELIX' al-
ways requires more felicitations
for all its diverse activities.
How about you?
