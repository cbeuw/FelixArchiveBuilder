A
sobi Seksu are a rock
band from New York,
and they’re awesome.
I’d forgotten this before
I saw them on Monday,
but they more than reminded me.
Yuki, Japanese-American vocalist and
keyboardist, may be small but her
voice carries a huge chorus like few
others. James, guitarist, is rather tall
and erratic, but this doesn’t stop his
ethereal sound gracefully blowing an
audience away.
These two songwriters are backed
up by the solid foundation of Billy and
Larry on bass and drums. Between
them, the group sounds something like
being crushed under a really beautiful
chandelier.
For a label, Asobi Seksu normally
get slapped with “nu-gaze”. This basi-
cally means they are a throwback to
the British shoegaze/dream pop bands
of the 90s (My Bloody Valentine, Coc-
teau Twins), but they’re more interest-
ing than that. Yuki alternates between
English and Japanese lyrics or often
simply uses her voice as an instrument.
Singing live she hits every note she did
on record (an impressive feat, despite
her naturally high range). James sings
a bit as well, but his genius is in his
melodic, undulating guitar. It’s surpris-
ing that one guy drowned in effects
can bring about such a tide of auditory
sweetness. This is the sound that dom-
inates their performance and sets the
audience swaying, until they explode
in feedback and instrumental contor-
tion, leaving us to absorb it for a while
before the encore.
Having released an acoustic album,
Rewolf, earlier that very day, it’s sur-
prising that they didn’t do any acoustic
tracks; perhaps a change of pace could
have accentuated even further the ex-

tremes of their songs. Nonetheless,
the well-mixed crowd filling Cargo –
an excellent, friendly venue – were in
good spirits. After their second stint
on stage, the band finished the set
without either of my favourite songs
but with the indie-pop-ish lead single
from latest album Hush, “Me & Mary”.
It doesn’t have the gravity of some of
their most recognisable older stuff,
e.g. “Thursday”, but it was a catchy and
memorable conclusion to a still broad-
ly impressive set; they saw off a satis-
fied crowd that night.
I
’ll be the first to admit that my
fellow Editors have perhaps a
more esoteric knowledge of mu-
sic. Or perhaps less tediously,
they’ve listened to a hell of a lot
more music than I have.
However since becoming Music Edi-
tor this year, I’ve been doing my best to
catch up (which partly explains why if
you see me around campus, I’ll be wear-
ing a pair of huge headphones that I
bought in Thailand). With that in mind,
I thought I’d give you a small recomen-
dation for the Christmas break.
• Tru Thoughts record label:
I didn’t have to go searching for these
guys, we received a promo copy of
their celebratory 10th anniversary
album and it literally blew me away.
Since the beginning of the decade
Tru Thoughts have been re-invent-
ing blues, jazz and soul music, mix-
ing them with calypso sounds, dub,
drum & bass and pretty much any-
thing that they can get their hands
on. If there’s anything that I can rec-
ommend in the full knowledge that
it’s impossible to dislike, it would be
any artist from this label; especially
Quantic, Bonobo and TM Juke.
I’m going to devote the rest of the
column to some artists that didn’t get
recognition on the “Albums of the
Decade” but that have undoubtedly
created some fantastic music.
Grizzly Bear’s latest album Vecka-
timest didn’t appeal to me on first
listen but give the door a quick shoul-
der and you’ll enter a beautiful world.
One of those albums that you’ll want
to play from start to finish and again
and again. Gang Gang Dance’s album
Saint Dymphna definitely warrants
an extended listen and possibly my fa-
vourite single in a long time, Matisya-
hu’s ‘Jerusalem’ will make you smile if
you get the biblical references.
Finally thanks to Alex, Chris, Luke,
Duncan Casey, Greg Power, Hugh Crail,
Eliot Barford, Jamie Fraser, Joanna Cai,
Tom Jennings and everyone else who’s
contributed. Merry Christmas!

Review
A
s the Yeah Yeah Yeahs sup-
port, Duchess Duke take
to the stage the humming
hive of The Brixton Acad-
emy erupt. The lead singer proceeded
to make orgasm noises as they begun
their opener. At first I thought this was
for the shock factor, but they contin-
ued these painful sex noises through-
out, leaving me in love with the Yeah
Yeah Yeahs’ set before they had even
lifted a finger.
The stage layout was an epic psy-
cadelic piece of art before the YYY
appeared in front of their hypnotised
fans. Front girl Karen O, lived up to
her name and wore artistic gypsy cos-
tumes, matching that of her stage. She
danced in a god-like manner as the jo-
vial sounds began.
The fun drumming beneath the ech-
oing sounds of resonating guitars and
the intense energy of Karen O’s voice
were mesmerizing. A giant blow-up
eyeball was launched into the crowd
and the energy hit incredible levels.
The songs that people really wanted
were played that night at the Brixton
Academy which I respect. Ending with
a quivering love song and encore-ing
with some fast energy rock, they left
the Academy full of happy, loved-up
people that hadn’t had enough of the
Yeah Yeah Yeahs pure fight.
