Quotes of the Week
Wordoku 1,448
Solution 1447
For the more observant amongst you, you’ll
have realised that there were two answers for
Wordoku last week. If you did, you got double
points. Winner was somebody who posted it
under the office door on Friday, but I lost it!
How to play:
Wordoku is identical to
Sudoku; we’ve just replaced
numbers with letters.
Complete the puzzle and
then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.
ac.uk. You will not get credit
for just the word alone. It’s not
an anagram.

How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in
a cell and must be surrounded with
a corresponding number of lines.
Lines cannot split and there can
only be one continuous line. Any
cells with no numbers can have any
number of lines. Look at the solu-
tion above for help.

And back to
the Vomit Pit!
CharlieMurdoch Coffee Break Editor

I
am in an inordinate amount of
pain. No srlsy halp! Yesterday was
the second ACC bar night of the
term, and after the “difficulties” of
the first, my vice (Zubin) and I brain-
stormed, Zubin bench pressed the
desk a few hundred times and we got
the new mobile bar more, much more
jugs. Oh yeah, and karaoke, everyone
loves a bit of the karaoke. The result...
absolute carnage, literally the whole of
my body hurts. Now I’ve never fallen
out of an aeroplane at 40,000 ft with-
out a parachute, I’m not an idiot, but
I know how much pain that would
induce. It was a night of epic propor-
tions, we even bust out the yard glass!
So yeah good stuff.
Moving back to the Vomit Pit idea
that I brought up a couple of weeks
ago, you’ll all be glad to know that we
have had a group meeting and there
have been a few issues raised. First-
ly the age old problem of throwing
freshers down wells to see is they are
witches or not. So to ensure that a poor
fresher is not thrown down the Pit to
see if they are a floater or not, we’re
going to have to install a grill over the
opening. There will also be a handrail
to hold onto whilst having your tech-
nicolour yawn, which doubles up as a
barrier to stop people accidently slip-
ping on the vomit grill.
Secondly there are numerous events
that go on in the upper echelons of the
Union. Noticeably the tie club dinners
and RSM events. Now these “dinners”
tend to end up a little messy, and some
poor sod has to rock out with a mob
and bucket. Not good. So the simple
way to solve this is to install one of
those big blue shoots that builders use
to drop stuff off of the top of some scaf-
folding and into a skip. This can be at-
tached to and open window and take
all the vomit straight into the pit. At
the end of the night, the shoot can be
washed down with a bit of water and it’s
right as the mail. If there’s not a strike
on. All these ideas have been submitted
to Phase 3 development group, but we
need your backing! Apologies for a few
general ‘mares last week, I was cocking
busy and couldn’t really be arsed that
much. Anyway, as I forgot to change
the quote last week, I’ve given you two
to chew down. One is a particularly
eloquent way to ask for a pint of two, I
suggest you use it as often as you pos-
sibly can. The results are interesting,
you’ll be surprised! Hokay bai!
Stuff Imperial students don’t like:
10. Slow People:
You’ve all been there, trying to get
into college and there is a whole
bunch of really slowly walking, nor-
mally tourists or children under
your feet. Why can’t they match
their pace to the surrounding pop-
ulation, is it really that hard to do?
If not, I firmly believe that a punch
to the back of the head (donkey
punch stylee) should be not only
accepted, but actively encouraged.
The stress and anger they cause to
us poor, normally hung over stu-
dents in the mornings is something
that we don’t need at the start of
a day. I am already a bit grumpy-
it’s not even 9am and I want to be
in bed. So tourists taking pictures
across the pavement, whilst walk-
ing slowly and asking me directions
to the Science Museum, rattles my
cage un peu. Trust me the next one
is getting smacked in the head.

Bill Vaughan: “In the game of life, it’s a good idea to have a few early losses, which relieves you of the pressure of trying to maintain an undefeated season.”
