IC Hockey hit form
After a barren spell of results in the
first two months of the season, ICHC
Men’s 1st XI hit a good run of form in
the last week, with victories over Kent
University in BUCS and the Royal Vet-
erinary College in the ULU Challenge
Cup.
Freshly promoted into BUCS South
East 1A, the men’s 1s came into their
game against Kent on knowing that a
result was possible against a team cur-
rently lying just one place above them
in the league.
ICHC played with discipline for the
full 70 minutes for the first time this
season, keeping possession well and
limiting the visitors to only a handful
of chances early on as IC went search-
ing for the opening goal.
After some fantastic wing-play from
Diana that resulted in a short corner, a
well drilled move was executed with a
straight strike from Yogi nearly break-
ing the backboard and giving the goal-
keeper little chance to save. This put us
1-0 up.
The next ten minutes proved that IC
could really compete in this league and
some champagne hockey upfront be-
tween Krusty, Koch and Diana proved
to be decisive as Yogi got his second
goal of the match, finishing the move
well to send us 2-0 up.
In the second half, IC dominated,
only conceding a lucky consolation
goal in the closing five minutes and
could well have scored more, however
despite some terrible administrative
errors from their goalkeeper IC were
unable to increase their lead.
The performance gives the 1st XI
renewed belief as they move into the
final two games, fighting against the
threat of relegation in this tight league.
The following Sunday saw the Men’s
1st XI open their ULU cup account
against the Royal Veterinary College
in the enchanting commuter town of
Potters Bar.
The weather made champagne hock-
ey nearly impossible, with rain, hail
and high winds throughout the game.
Despite this hindrance, IC made light
work of the Vets’ side, with an early hat
trick from Stumpy leaving the opposi-
tion in no doubt as to who was going to
dominate the game.
Stumpy also had several more op-
portunities to hit the back of the net,
although his attempts were thwarted
on one occasion by the head of a de-
fender, requiring the poor Vet student
to make a trip to the hospital to get his
skull stitched back together.
A fourth goal from Stumpy and a
first for Dennis meant IC cruised into
the break 5-0 up.
Goals from Krusty, Yogi and another
for Dennis in the second half put the
game completely out of reach of the
opposition and also gave goalkeeper
ET a chance to update his spread-
sheets, prepare the club’s cash flow
forecast and visit the local bank to pay
in the team’s match fees, such was the
(lacking) frequency of the attacks on
his goal.
In short, IC came away with a
thumping 8-0 victory, progressing into
the second round of the cup where
they are likely to meet Imperial College
Medicals in the New Year.

Challenge Cup Drama
Gaelic Ladies
put up ‘a fight’
against St
Mary’s
ICUAFCs Men’s 1st XI began their
ULU Challenge Cup against the Impe-
rial College Medicals 1st XI, familiar
faces once a year in the Varsity match.
This tie is sometimes a weird one to
judge, especially when the seriousness
of both teams is put into question. Af-
ter a joke of a Varsity last where Col-
lege were 5-nil victors despite fielding
a weakened side and having 2 players
sent-off, respective captains Musta-
pher Botchway and Karim Amer en-
sured that this game will be played to
a standard worth watching.
Despite the Medicals playing ULU
football one league below College, they
were more fired up at the beginning of
the game. After an injury to College
centre back Tom Fryatt, they deserv-
edly went 1-nil up when a flurry of cor-
ners in the space of 4 minutes were not
dealt with correctly; the 5th of these
Last Sunday, the Imperial College La-
dies Gaelic football team set off in a
minibus borrowed from the King’s
School, Pontefract (long bizarre sto-
ry) for their competitive debut. Our
expectations were not as high as our
spirits as we drove through the pour-
ing rain to St Mary’s impressive sports
facilities. Optimism levels were high as
Katie “the wall” Cullen shouted our po-
sitions over the sound of rain hammer-
ing on the minibus roof and explained
what the phrase “wing-back” actually
meant. Finally, the imposing silhouette
of the St Mary’s captain filled the wind-
screen and took us to the club house
where the Mary’s girls were collecting,
each decked out in inter-county attire
and built like a brick sh*t house. Mia
amongst others managed to keep team
morale up as we “warmed up” in the ri-
diculous weather conditions.
St. Mary’s eventually decided to
grace us with their presence (after
one or two trips from their cars to the
clubhouse) and joined us on the rugby
pitch. As they turned their county-
level Gaelic football shirts inside out
we, slightly smugly, tucked our Impe-
rial Men’s Gaelic football team shirts
(which could be mistaken for Gaelic
football dresses) into our shorts.
The game began. Carla was quick off
the mark with her first (& only) contri-
bution to the game - tonking the ball
the wrong way and beautifully setting
up a “girl” from St Mary’s for a shot
on goal. Unfortunately, she pulled a
muscle executing this excellent assist
and was subsequently stretchered off
to coach the team from the sidelines
and record fines in Katie’s little black
book to be paid for in the union later.
Sadly, the ball was to remain in our
half for the opening of the game. As a
wing forward, I plainly pulled out some
popcorn and watched, with Cathy and
Sarah, as our team mates wrestled
with the team of “mountain women”
for a few minutes before we had the
revelation of going to help them. As
the minutes ticked by, and one or two
goals somehow skimmed past Katie,
we learnt and grew as fast as the fame
of an X Factor finalist and brought the
game to a new level. With Chloe and
Sophie, amongst others, getting on the
end of some awesome kick passes from
Moira and splitting the St Mary’s de-
fence, Andy and Phil would have been
proud.
The half-time whistle blew and,
though the score line was a lot to noth-
ing, Imperial were un-phased and en-
thusiastic to get going again. Mia, who
had taken the hallowed goalie gloves
