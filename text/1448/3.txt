Guilds President to step down
The City and Guilds College Union
(CGCU) has had a difficult time this
Autumn. It came under attack for the
disorganisation surrounding its Mas-
querade Ball in October and was un-
dermined when serious conflicts be-
tween the President Kirsty Patterson
and Treasurer Rikki Norris became
public.
The Union which represents engi-
neering students is facing yet more
turmoil as President Kirsty Patterson is
likely to be forced to resign by the end
of this term.
The situation has arisen due to an un-
certainty regarding Ms Patterson’s reg-
istration as a student at Imperial. Miss
Patterson formerly a 4th year Geology
Masters student, was encouraged by
her department to graduate immedi-
ately with a BSci instead of continuing
her studies this year. Ms Patterson will
begin a Masters course in the next aca-
demic year.
Although she has not yet formally
been de-registered as a student, several
reliable sources have made it clear to fe-
lix that it is all but inevitable.
Union President Ashley Brown com-
mented, “I’m confident the operations
of the CGCU will not be affected by the
changeover, but we’ll try to give them
any support they need.”
However her likely departure has
already had an impact as plans for a
CGCU Beer festival in the Spring have
been shelved.
Likely candidates for the post in-
clude Guilds Chairman Dan Lundy and
Treasurer Rikki Norris.
Mr Lundy offered his thanks to Ms
Patterson for her time in office, and

Ex-Editor banned from Union
as felix celebrates 60 years
A
round fifty past and
present contributors of
felix came together at
the Union Dining Hall
on Saturday 6th Decem-
ber for a special dinner to celebrate the
60th anniversary of Imperial College
student newspaper. The night ended
sourly as organiser Jovan Nedic ended
up being banned from the Union with
immediate effect by dinner guest and
Union President Ashley Brown.
The evening began with a reception
at the Union bar which was a great op-
portunity for multiple generations of
felix editors and writers to share sto-
ries of their experience at the paper
and at Imperial College. A tour of the
felix office was conducted by the cur-
rent team for those who had not seen
it since they left which in some cases,
had been a matter of decades.
For some of these guests especially,
the change in the office was bewilder-
ing. David Cooper, who was the Edi-
tor-in-Chief of felix 40 years ago, later
remarked in his toast during dinner
how different the office looked from
his days at felix.
The rest of the evening was enjoyed
over a three-course dinner at the Un-
ion Dining Hall, during which speech-
es were given, including those by Dan
Wan and Jovan Nedic. The first guest
speaker of the evening, Imperial alum-
nus and science writer Simon Singh,
also recounted his years as a physics
undergraduate and RSCU president.
Singh went on to share his thoughts
on the UK libel laws, before he gives a
guest lecture at Imperial this week.
The second guest speaker during din-
ner was ex-felix Editor Pallab Ghosh,
who is currently a BBC Science Cor-
respondent. He spoke enthusiastically
about his career in science journalism
and admitted that working at felix gave
him gave him a taste of, and ultimately
led him towards, becoming a scientific
reporter.
A felix awards ceremony followed the
speeches; each award was presented by
Jovan Nedic and bottles of champagne
were awarded to the winners of each
section.
The event was wrapped up with a pho-
to opportunity, and before we could all
say ‘cheese’
, the celebration of 60 years of
felix had been captured in a photograph.
As the night’s proceedings came to
an end, tension strings snapped be-
tween the Union bar staff, providing
drinks throughout the evening, and
Nedic. The removal of the unused keg
of beer from behind the portable bar
sparked off an argument that resulted
an innebriated Nedic berating mem-
bers of the Union staff behind Da Vin-
ci’s bar. He was subsequently banned
from the Union for a week without a
hearing by a present Ashley Brown.
Lord Browne discusses HE with President Brown
O
n the 9th November,
the Independent Re-
view of Higher Edu-
cation Funding and
Student Finance was
launched. This review, led by Lord
John Browne will make recommenda-
tions to the Government on the future
of fees policy and financial support for
full and part-time undergraduate and
postgraduate students.
On Monday, ICU President Ashley
Brown attended the launch of the first
call for evidence for the Independent
Review, involving a round-table ses-
sion with Lord Browne and two other
members of the panel: Professor Julia
King, Vice Chancellor of Aston Uni-
versity (and former principal of the
Faculty of Engineering at Imperial),
and Rajay Naik.
Despite “very little notice” of the
event, representatives from other Lon-
welcomed any future involvement with
the CGCU.
He said “On behalf of the CGCU
Executive committee we would like to
thank Kirsty for her great effort this
term in taking the Guilds forwards. It is
a shame she cannot continue in this role
but we wish her all the best and hope
she will still contribute from a non-ex-
ecutive position throughout the rest of
the year.”

don institutions were present includ-
ing UCL, LSE, King’s and ULU.
Topics covered ranged from the
impact of fees on university choices
to views on the proposed “food la-
belling” system for university quality.
This system, proposed by the Depart-
ment of Business, Innovation and
Skills, will flag up teaching hours, ca-
reer prospects and seminar frequency
giving students more choice allowing
them to act as paying consumers.
Despite the session being “very
brief”, Ashley Brown wrote on his
Blog that “there would be many other
opportunities to provide evidence to
the review, something we’ll be making
use of”.
