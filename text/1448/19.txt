Dress by Hubert de Givenchy
Givenchy became the sole couturier
to Audrey Hepburn, who was to wear
only garments designed by him in
almost all of her movies. His clientele
included some of the best-dressed
women of all time: Grace Kelly, Jackie
Kennedy-Onassis, Elizabeth Taylor et
al. It’s an obvious choice really, Santa.

Marc Jacobs and Rouland Moret
are fans of Victoria Beckham’s new
clothing range. Beckham, who
champions both the labels, is set to
lanch a sunglasses range under her
Victoria Beckham label. Jacobs said of
the fashionista “She is someone who
has always wanted to design clothes.
She knows the body, she loves it and
she’s working her ass off.”
French department store Printemps
has enlisted the help of many
designers including Christopher
Kane to create dresses for its window
display inspired by the forthcoming
Tim Burton version of the classic story
“Alice in Wonderland”. Other names
involved include Alexander Mcqueen,
Ann Demeulemeester and Bernhard
Willhelm.
Tamara Mellon, the owner of the
Jimmy Choo empire, has won a 6
million dollar lawsuit against her
mother Ann Yeardye.
Mellon sued her mother for a breach
of contract. Shares that should have
gone directly to Mellon instead went
to her mother.

News Strip
Santa, Santa can you hear us?
A: “Lady Gaga is a sell-out of Haus of Gaga.
Traitor!”
K: “Why?”
A: “She was wearing the entire collection
from Alexander McQueen in her new video.
The whole look – everything – straight off the
runway.”
K: “Didn’t she debut Bad Romance at Alexan-
der’s SS10 show?”
A: “Everything, off the runway! Not something
Lady Gaga does!”
S: “How the McQueen sample sale drained my
bank account!”
K: “I hate you! WHAT DID YOU BUY?”
S: “Two gowns – one of the gowns is in the
pink/silver crystal print from SS10, short
sleeved with draping around the arm (I had
to fight for it!) The other is black, with clear
mesh at the back, it’s totally backless. A shirt
– in large black and white houndstooth, with
ties at the neck to make a bow. LOOOVE.”
K: “What’s with this obsession with Balmain
last season? Every single season looks the
same.”
A: “It was the excessive military look...”
K: “There are military looks in Balmain every
single season since Decarnin took over!”
A: “Well, they were clever with their market-
ing. The ready to wear price point was raised
and raised and they suddenly became the
item to die for...”

Una Burke’s Armour
I am smitten with the neatly construct-
ed artwork. The layered strips of nude
shade leather are strapped together
with bronze studs. What I love the
most is the medici collar. Avant-garde
with a fetish touch. Schexy.

To live in the 50s
Women need no excuses to wear red
lipstick. Dresses need no excuses to in-
corporate a décolleté neckline. Schia-
parelli is the dress maker of choice; not
H&M. 50’s is an age when fashion nos-
talgia does not exist. Santa, can I have
a time machine please? KW
Ostrich
None of that Paris Hilton’s stupid dog
in the bag business. I want to ride an
ostrich to Uni. I want to personalise
the ostrich with a tiny tiara. And give
it a personalised pet jacket complete
with a Gucci ostrich cage.
If at any point Karl decides to design
a dress for me, the feathers will
certainly come in handy... KW
The Entire Chanel Paris-Shanghai
Collection (Bespoke, of course)
I want the combo of Desrues’ custom-
made buttons, Lemarie’s feathers, Les-
age’s embroidery, Michel’s hats and
Massaro’s shoes. Above all, Karl Lager-
feld’s design! I don’t care if the dresses
are £200,000 a pop. KW
Bring Lacroix back to life!
The brand will be reduced to accesso-
ries and perfumery only. Haute cou-
ture and RTW dresses made by the leg-
endary designer are now a thing of the
past. If there’s only one Xmas wish, I’ll
forfeit every wish above just for Lac-
roix to make a comeback... KW
Jean Paul Gaultier fur coat
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree?
How about this Jean Paul Gaultier fur
coat instead. I can fantasize about
walking into a party wearing this coat
or sitting in a bar, femme fatale style,
with a 20s feather head piece. A piece
this gorgeous, it’s completely worth it.
You say fur? I say FUR! I mean, we eat
meat right? RN
Roland Mouret Chimera Long dress
Rouland Mouret’s dresses flatter the
female form so it’s only fair it is on my
Christmas wish list. This will transform
its wearer into the belle of the ball.
Simply teamed with skyscraper black
patent heels, a clutch and festive bling.
Yum. GG
Miu Miu Black leather handbag
Every girl needs a good bag and this
is one that I would particularly love to
see under my Christmas tree. You can
take it from day to night, and it is large
enough to hold all of one’s essentials,
with some space to spare (perhaps for
a matching purse?). This bag is time-
less, so the £750 price tag is really a
bargain. In theory. GG
Tail feathers
To be honest, does anything more
need to be said? These feathers
are absolutely awesome. From the
Victoria’s Secret spring-summer 10
show, you’d definitely want these
to compliment your sexy christmas
underwear... RN
A Louis Vuitton Bag
No, not your average monogram bor-
ing ass aristocratic bourgeoisie bag. I
mean the floursecent green canvas bag
with a fur pom pom. Mr Jacobs, how
about sending me a couple of those?
Or how about in every single shade
and every single size too? KW

Custom-Designed Louboutins
A shoe that will bring other women to
tears with desire, lust and despair. A
ruby-red, patent leather, 4-inch Pigalle
pump with a large, faceted scarlet crys-
tal on the vamp, encrusted with tiny
crystals and surrounded by an explo-
sion of crimson ostrich feathers. SV
