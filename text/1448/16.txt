L
ike all “Albums of the Dec-
ade” lists, this one reflects the
Editors’ personal tastes (Alex
Ashford would like to point
out that her list would be vastly differ-
ent). Given that the decade began when
we were aged 10-12, we tried to sum up
the sound of the decade as we heard it
during our teenage years. It’s possible to
swap and change the order ad nauseam
but ultimately every album on the list is
there for being simply damn good.
Albums of
the Decade
1
2
Radiohead
Kid A
Truthfully, this
isn’t enough
space to even
begin writing
about this al-
bum. Simply a
pivotal piece of
modern culture.
3
Jay-Z
The Black
Album
Ultimately Jay-Z
didn’t retire but
his ‘final’ album
called on the
best producers
of the day and
was immacu-
lately polished.

The Strokes
Is This It
This album set
off a decade of
bands searching
to recreate the
genius that The
Strokes exhib-
ited which such
apparent ease.
5
Arctic
Monkeys
Whatever
people say...
Arguably the
first ‘internet
band’ to achieve
significantmain-
stream success,
their intelligent
lyrics spoke to a
generation.
9
Kings of
Leon
Aha Shake
Heartbreak
Undeniably in-
fluenced by #4,
KoL avoided be-
ing simple copies
byintroducingan
addictive South-
ern sound into
the mix.

mains interesting
after the ump-
teenth listen.
7

Fever To Tell
YYYs hit the
scene with guitar
riffs that electri-
fied your ears
combined with
Karen O’s vocals
this album was a
revelation.

was at once in-

cessible, Silent
Alarm was the
soundtrack to
99% of people’s
teenage years
10
Kanye
West

Dropout
After years of

Arcade Fire
‘Funeral’
2004
Arcade Fire’s beautifully crafted debut
‘Funeral’ is an encapsulating emotional
joy. Named in memory of several band
members’ deceased family, it’s far from
an overtly morbid affair; the euphoria
and passion of the band pulling togeth-
er drips out of the speakers to totally
encapsulate you. This album paved the
way for indie music in the second half
of the decade and five years since its
release, its quality remains undisputed.
