COFFEE BREAK
Fallo-scopes; putting the cock back into horoscopes
That’s the last time I’m ever leaving a woman in charge of my twelve babies. Motherly instinct, my arse!
Cancer
You’re officially a
cockjockey. No-one
actually likes you and
you have no idea why.
Maybe it’s something
to do with the fact
you just sit next to people leaching their oxygen
and generally their time. It’s also something to
do with the fact that you’re ginger and have an
annoying voice. Shut the fuck up and go away.
No, seriously, go throw yourself off.
Virgo
You’ve come round
for dinner and your
friends are treating
you like a king. They
refuse to let you help
with dinner, and
they’re being abnormally generous with their
food. You hear them whispering and it turns out
they’re got you lined up as their ‘roast dinner’
tomorrow night. Fuck. You go mental, they deny
their dastardly plan, and you just look paranoid.
Gemini
You see a girl across
the bar and she gives
you a little cheeky
smile. You move over
to the dancefloor and
give her a seductive
look to come join you. She’s a bit short, and
she’s gliding through the club rather oddly. She’s
hot and classy, that’s what classy birds do, right?
SHE’S ON A CHAIR WITH WHEELS. I can’t
wait to wrap her legs up in knots.
Pisces
Florence from the
Machine? How hot
is she? She might be
ginger, but my balls,
is she hot. Look at
her, prancing about
on stage with her ‘machine’
. Well, let me tell you
now, I’d definitely be her ‘machine’
. OI OI, know
what I mean? No, I’d happily be her vibrator.
Yeh? Slow on the uptake, lad. Come on. Ginger
lad. Ginger lad.
Leo
IF YOU SWEAR
AGAIN I’LL GET
YOU THROWN
OUT, STOP BEING
A FOUL-MOUTHED
SOD. Well, that’s the
last time I’m sitting in the home end of Vicarage
Road with diseased pensioners surrounding me.
Oh, it doesn’t matter, Watford have just scored
three goals against the QPR scum. The Golden
Boys are on the march again. You ‘oooooorns!
Aries
You’ve realised your
destiny is to kill all
ginger people. You
don’t know how you’re
going to do it, you
just know it definitely
needs to be done. Pubes first, maybe. Getting
rid of the trail of red that covers that covers their
filthy genitals that allow them to breed more of
their ginger filth. Oh no. Oh no. This can’t be hap-
pening. I just found my own ginger pube.
Scorpio
You’ve just snorted the
exact weight of Sir Roy
Anderson’s left foot (an-
kle down) in ketamine,
and you’ve entered a
serious K-hole. Con-
gratulations. You’re this year’s Nobel Prize Winner,
and you’re sitting there like a chump with no idea
what’s going on. They decide you don’t actually
want your cheque for £100,000, and give it away.
£100,000. That’s 100,000 items at Poundland!
Libra
You’re so paranoid
from Virgo’s
happenings, that all
your friends become
very wary of you.
They stay away, and
you’re effectively a loner that only has wanking
in front of your mate’s mum as his only human
interaction. All your mates’ mums have been
advised to stay away from you, and well, you’ve
got nothing. Might as well top yourself, son.
Taurus
You’ll get laid at the
Christmas Ball. You
get her back to your
room, , but she’s
not that attractive
or interesting. She’s
lying there doing and saying nothing. Suddenly,
she pipes up with some of the hottest dirty
talk you’ve ever heard. She’s well good at mid-
intercourse-dirty-talk, she is. Tourrettes is
awesome. SPLAT.
Capricorn
You’re in the Union, and
you’re naked. Why are
you naked and why is
there a massive black
dong hanging out of
your arse? Either way
you need to take a step back and re-evaluate your
life. Before taking that step back, make sure that
you remove the dong from your arse though. That
may get caught and you’ll be unable to remove it.
That will be bad times. Pint?
Aquarius
The Japanese. I love
them, I do. All their
cute little cartoons
and culture. And
their girls. Oh man,
their girls. I would
do unmentionable things to them. Actually,
they’re quite mentionable. Spitroast, headfuck,
upside-down-gasoline-in-your-ear, the wart-
scraper, the felching, the clunge-hammer AND
the cum-bucket.

Sagittarius
You go home this
weekend and find
your mum fucking
your gardener. Wait a
minute, you don’t have
a gardener. Oh, it’s your
dad dressed up in overalls. Oh, wait your Dad
ran off when you were 12. Oh, it’s your brother
dressed up in a moustache, grey hair and overalls.
Shit bruv, your own brother is fucking your own
mother. Incest is best. Apparently.

So a new record last week for getting
this puzzle in. It was handed to Dan
the Wan whilst he was putting the pa-
pers out, at 12.35! That means that the
paper had been in the bins for about
half and hour. That’s keen. Oh yeah
the winner was a new team- The Cool
Kids and Fergal, well done to you.
