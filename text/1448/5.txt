FIGHTING
FOR LIBEL
REFORM
IN LIGHT OF SIMON SINGH RETURNING TO IMPERIAL TO GIVE A
LECTURE ON THE LIBEL LAWS THAT HE IS PERSONALLY EMBROILED
IN, DAN WAN GIVES AN UPDATE ON HIS CURRENT SITUATION
A
s Imperial alumnus Si-
mon Singh prepares to
return to College to give a
guest lecture on the libel
laws in science of which
he has fallen foul of, the Government
have announced the commencement
of a working group on libel reform.
Singh announced his support of po-
tential reform to guests of the felix’s
60th anniversary dinner last Saturday,
and it is obvious to see why.
He is currently awaiting a hearing
at the Court of Appeal on the 22nd of
February 2010; the British Chiroprac-
tic Association are suing him for com-
ments he made in his Guardian column
in April 2008. He stands to lose a small
fortune if the final verdict does not go
his way.
“The decision could go either way. We
are still only arguing about the mean-
ing of the article, so we remain a long
way from the trial itself and settling the
whole matter. I suspect that this libel
battle could continue for at least anoth-
er year,” he told felix.
Though, even if the final verdict falls
in his favour, he himself admits in cases
such as his, he is likely to lose a substan-
tial amount of money anyway.
In this way, scientists and journalists
have argued that current libel laws in
England and Wales are severely stifling
the advancement of scientific debate
and free speech. In a case with two sides
to the argument (as in the majority of
scientific or medical discussions), Eng-
lish libel laws have been heavily criti-
cised for encouraging the accused side
of responding with defamation or slan-
der lawsuit claims, rather than putting
their own argument beyond reproach
with relevant scientific evidence.
The formation of the working group,
led by Justice Secretary Jack Straw, was
announced in the House of Lords. Jack
Straw called the current laws of which
Simon Singh is suffering “unbalanced”
and in need of a “radical change”, whilst
freedom of speech campaigners are
lobbying firm proposals for the upcom-
ing reforms in English libel laws.
Science-specialised journalist, TV
producer and author Simon Singh fell
victim to the ill-balanced libel laws in
April 2008 when he published an ar-
ticle on the Guardian website called
“Beware the spinal trap.” The article
was in response to Chiropractic Aware-
ness Week 2008, and condemned the
(BCA) for promoting treatments that
he claimed were “bogus”
.
Though he freely admitted chiroprac-
tic treatment can help cure localised
back problems, he stated there “is not a
jot of evidence” for the efficacy of chi-
ropractic treatment with colic, sleeping
and feeding problems, frequent ear in-
fections, asthma and prolonged crying.
Subsequently, the BCA filed for libel
against Singh, and contended that his
comments on the national newspa-
per’s website have “seriously injured its
credit and reputation”. The BCA made
it clear that they are seeking damages
from Singh personally, and not from
the Guardian.
Though The Guardian initially
backed Singh’s case as the publisher of
his article, they soon pulled out to leave
Singh standing in the courts alone.
On Sense for Science’s (a charitable
trust that promotes fair and balanced
debate in science) website, Singh rea-
soned with The Guardian’s decision.
“To a large extent I understand The
Guardian’s position and its decision,” he
stated. However, critics of English libel
laws claim it is not a situation journal-
ists and authors should have to swallow.
Media groups, as well as individuals
defending libel claims, can lose six-fig-
ure sums in covering legal costs alone.
“No win no fee” rulings are to blame,
putting the losing side heavily into the
red. Simon Singh has reportedly already
had to find £100,000 to just unsuccess-
fully defend himself in front of Judge
David Eady, the UK’s leading judge on
libel and slander issues, in a preliminary
hearing at the Courts of Justice in May
2009. The damages awarded to the suc-
cessful party in such a case as the BCA
vs. Simon Singh can easily be dwarfed
by the legal costs incurred of running
the trial. Singh, amongst many others,
worries these costs are stifling ability to
defend respectable work.
He said: “The current libel laws force
many academics and writers to back
down on matters that they believe to
be accurate; this is simply because they
do not have the funds to back their be-
liefs. Free speech should not depend
on whether or not someone is rich or
powerful.”
During felix’s 60th anniversary cel-
ebratory dinner, in which Singh was a
guest speaker, he endorsed charities
dedicating support to fair journalis-
tic freedom of speech, namely English
Pen, a British-based international char-
ity that backs persecuted writers. To-
gether with Index on Censorship, an
anti-censorship charity, English Pen has
released a report outlining suggestions
for the Government’s reform working
group that is expected to produce the
majority of its fruits within the next
couple of months.
The report directly relates to the fi-
nancial imbalance in libel action. They
suggest a cap of £10,000 on libel pay-
outs, and drastically minimising legal
costs incurred by the losing party. They
also suggest a shift of the burden of
proof to the claimant. The claimant, the
BCA in Singh’s case, would first have to
actually prove that Singh’s comments
had “defamed” their reputation before
the hearing could continue. It would
effectively add an extra layer of protec-
tion on the accused, and a fairer trial
that would mean both sides of the claim
would have to prove something.
The campaigners are also pushing re-
forms to prevent “libel tourism”; Singh
also drew attention to this issue during
his short speech this weekend. Current
English libel laws are poorly designed
so that they allow any publication dis-
tributed in the UK to be subject to libel
action under English courts, and not
the courts of the publication’s origin.
American newspapers have threatened
to stop their limited circulation in Lon-
don if the native libel laws continue to
so heavily favour libel action against
them.
“If we don’t act we’re at risk of becom-
ing a global pariah. There are US States
who view English libel law as so dam-
aging to free speech they have passed
laws to effectively block the decisions of
English judge,” said John Kampfner, the
CEO of Index on Censorship.
Singh continues to show his une-
quivocal support for libel reform and
the parallel lobbying of proposals.
“Libel reform is now an active issue
the politicians are willing to listen and
it up to the public to make enough
noise to move the issue up the political
agenda,” he said to felix.
There is an air of poignancy as Singh
returns to Blackett Lab’s Lecture Thea-
tre 1, where he was taught the scien-
tific disciplines he defends today, to
present a guest lecture to Imperial
students about his own case and most
importantly its wider meaning for the
English legal fields on Monday 14th
December. He stressed the impor-
tance of these issues to both current
and future scientists.
“I want to explain what is wrong with
English libel laws and then address any
doubts that people might have about
whether or not reform is necessary. I
am keen that as many people as pos-
sible at Imperial sign the petition for li-
bel reform. As they stand, the libel laws
restrict scientific debate, so reforming
the libel laws should be an important
issue for both staff and students.”
The long and winding road to libel reform
19 April 2008 -
Simon Singh writes
an article in the
Guardian questioning
the legitimacy of
chiropractic treatment.
This resulted in the
British Chiropractic
Association suing him
for libel. The Guardian
stands by him and covers
the cost of the lengthy
lawsuit.
7 May 2009 -
Preliminary hearing takes
place in the Royal Courts
of Justice, the judge holds
that Singh’s article accuses
the BCA of knowingly
being dishonest.
Singh denies this
interpretation and points
out that his case is now
very difficult to fight.
14 October 2009
Singh is allowed leave
to give him time to
appeal. Speculation is
generating as to how
this will affect the right
of freedom of speech in
critising alternative.
29 November 2009
20,000 people have
signed a petition
started by the charity
‘Sense about Science’
who issued the
following statement;
“The English law of
libel has no place in
scientific disputes
about evidence.”
14 December 2009
Simon Singh comes
back to Imperial
College, where he
studied, to give a talk
about his case and the
surrounding issues.
