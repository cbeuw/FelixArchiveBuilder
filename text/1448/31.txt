How to play:
Solve the clues (given in order:
top-to-bottom & left-to-right)
and fit the answers into the
grid. Only letters contributing
to the horizontal answers (and
blank spaces) may occupy the
middle section. Not all columns
contain a vertical answer. There
are no empty rows or columns
in the solution. Look at the
solution below for help.
Send your solutions to:
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Horizontal:
Surnames of past felix editors
(in order - last most recent)
Vertical:
1) Santa Claus
2) Restaurant without a waiter
3) A long journey with a
purpose (usually a group)
4) Able to hear the dead
5) The city of angels

Okay... so I messed this up completely
by using the (incorrect) list of editors
from felix’s Wikipedia page, which
doesn’t match up exactly with the
list of editors that was printed at the
front of last issue. So I’m including
this one again, as we had no entries! I
promise that this one is safe as.
Seen that special
person? Could be
the one? Want to
see them again?

How to play:
The numbers represent the size and order of blocks
in each column and row. There must be at least one
space between each block.
Well the grids did not line up as well as was hoped
and some people were confused as to how to
combine the two results - If both grids have been
solved correctly, looking through the page from
the front, any opaque cells on the back will show
up grey where they overlap with empty cells on the
front (see solution below).
This was hotly contested but the first correct
solution was submitted by Harry Potter Trio, well
done and the was double points on offer for this
puzzle last week. Bit like a bankers bonus.

Going Underground Has Gone!
There was not a significant response to save Going Underground so we’ve
buried it and are busy preparing a whole new selection of puzzles to replace it.
However, if you would rather have Going Underground revived (or have your
own suggestions for puzzles you’d like to see), let us know:
