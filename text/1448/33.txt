small chance that you suffer from Pe-
yonie’s disease, which is associated with
a large hard lump on side of the penis
which can make the shaft bend. It is
caused by localized trauma, so your
vigorous pumping maybe the root of
the problem. As far as treatment goes
an injection may be necessary or in the
worst case a surgical operation to re-
move the plaque.

Dear Aunty McPickle,
Today in yoga, I was stretching and
getting into the zone, when a friend
leant over to pull the long hair off
my joggers. It was actually my pu-
bic hair sticking through the fabric.
I screamed. I’m not a massive fan of
shaving or waxing, how can I avoid
in this in the future?
Hairy Mary
Dear Mary,
I think you need to get over the shav-
ing/waxing phobia. It is not normal
to have protruding pubes which are
noticed from afar. Unless you want to
strap them in with a chastity belt type
gadget, it would be very wise to take a
trip to boots, NOW!

Yes, it’s what you think. Have a bloody good shave once in a while, place the formerly attached entities in a little baggy, and snort it. You’ll never be the same.
Last Friday, three merry RAGgers
accompanied the Imperial College
Chamber Choir to Green Park Tube
Station to raise money for the Great
Ormond Street Hospital. Rounds of
“Ding Dong Merrily on High” rang
from the ticket hall and down the long
corridors, letting the commuters know
that Christmas has come.
Unusually for 7 pm in Central Lon-
don, the passengers were reported
to have actually smiled and to have
looked somewhat merry, thanks to the
angelic voices of our choir.
Londoners and tourists alike stopped
to watch, listen, and most importantly
empty their purses into our collection
bins. The Christmas cheer gave on-
lookers the patience and sense of char-
ity to bother to stop and help make this
RAG’s most successful Tube collection
in living memory, raising £1,400!
If you want to help rouse the Christ-
mas spirit along with RAG, then come
join us on Monday at Trafalgar Square,
where we’ll be collecting with the main
choir, who’ll be on the grand stage.

A-caroling we go!
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I’m a computer science student.
I have never had physical contact
with a girl. My problem is that be-
cause of my masturbation, my penis
has changed shape so that it is no
longer straight or functional. I am
afraid that if a girl ever saw what I
have done, she will be very afraid.
Are there any surgical options or am
I doomed to live life with a wonky
schlong?
Antony Benton
Dear Antony,
This sounds very worrying. Mastur-
bation is normally very good for penile
condition. You should probably con-
sider your technique, may be you’ve
been using too much force. There’s a
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I am foreign student and has date
with very pretty English girl. She
study geology very hard. We went
to nice restaurant. She sees stone
table and look with special lens - I
think very cute. And then she talks
fast, I cannot understand but hear
‘not dyke’ and ‘lick it’
. She points
table. I think I understand. So I go
under. She scared, hit me in face and
go home. I sad. I very love her. Help
please Aunty!
Dylan Highe
Dear Dylan,
I suggest going to English lessons. This
type of affair is only going to happen
again. The consequences may be great-
er next time.
I’m sure being arrested for attempted
sexual harassment is not on your to do
list (or is it?).
