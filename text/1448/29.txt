Putting the cat out to dry
Y
ou’re in the festive spir-
it. No you’re not, don’t
be stupid. We’re British
depressives. We enjoy be-
ing miserable and taking
it out on others. However, instead of
sitting in your cold office and watch-
ing your nephew’s son die of starva-
tion and then enduring three tedious
revelations from ghosts with a slender
grasp of the space-time continuum,
there is a much better way of ruining
others’ Christmases.
Have a better Christmas – ‘out-
Christmas’ them. When they receive
forty Christmas cards, write forty one
to yourself. When they make a wreath
and place it on their door, make a big-
ger one and put it on your house! And
if you still think they’re out-Christmas-
sing you, it’s time to pull out the tree!
That’s right, there is more to that
Abies alba than pine and tinsel. People
just cast their Christmas tree into the
dingy corner of the living room and
leave it there to die slowly in a coil of
pretty flashing lights.
Well fuck that! Ain’t no Christmas
tree gonna die on our watch! We’d take
a bullet for our Christmas tree, and so
would you.
Here is a list of 45 fun things to do
with your beloved ‘fir’iend:
If you thought Hangman articles were getting ridiculous, feel well-assured that this one is no different

THE TROUBLED
EMU
THE
I
t’s not hard to write a Christmas
film, it only takes some basic in-
gredients and we’ve written a syn-
opsis of our Screenplay, ‘Bearly a
Christmas’. We’ll take you through the
steps we followed in writing this family
fun feature.
1 – We needed the generic Christmas
film story-line. This consists of Christ-
mas being ruined, and then fixed –
The End.
So what constitutes a ruined Christ-
mas? Someone dying. Being a family
film, it needed to encompass all age
ranges so we decided to have a
child being savagely mauled to
death by a jolly bear.
2 – We then needed a good
Christmassy cast. One name
that immediately fitted the
bill was Hugh Grant – he
would be the incapa-
ble, bumbling, but
lovable Dad. Jen-
nifer Garner is the
pragmatic, but es-
sentially hot mum/
wife.
3 – The story takes place in Bear Town,
Oregon. Hugh Grant is a well-estab-
lished lumberjack. His lumber-team,
however, are strongly against his pro-
bear ethics.
4 – Grant’s pro-bear ethics are tested
when he comes home to witness his
daughter being brutally shredded
apart by the jolly talking dancing bear,
played by Brian Blessed.
5 – Jennifer Garner is sobbing hysteri-
cally. She tells Grant to shoot the jolly
bear, but he feels that too
many lives have been lost
for one day.
6 – Instead, he invites the
jolly bear inside, determined
not to have him ruin their
family Christmas. After a
comical evening of cha-
rades, Twister and Af-
ter Eights, Hugh and
Jennifer decide to
put their differences
with the jolly bear
aside and ask him to
live with them.

Alrite Osie, I’ll do Europe and America. U do

We love hearing from the fans and have
received some really warm feedback.
Send some of your love to
hangman.felix@imperial.ac.uk
“Dear Hangman. I am an ex-editor of this
shambolic newspaper. Firstly, we were
much funnier in 1873. I am highly offended
by your alternative history of felix, it was
almost completely inaccurate. Although I
believe we did sponsor the 80s – the 1880s
that is. Mozart was making a comeback,
and we were all fucked on opium anyway.
I miss those days. Love, E.M. Mews ”
