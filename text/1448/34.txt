It has been one of the busiest and most
successful terms in the history of Im-
perial college swimming club, includ-
ing 4 galas over 5 weeks, two of which
taking place on the national stage. The
term started with the first ever ULU
swimming league fixture against teams
from Queen Mary and King’s College.
This competition, designed to get all
London universities more involved in
swimming, looked to be a promising
conquest for the swimming club, as
one of the stronger teams in London.
The team did not disappoint, with
all swimmers putting in 100% over
the evening, which resulted in a con-
vincing win over the other teams, in
which imperial won more than 75%
of the events swum, and gained nearly
double the points of the other teams.
Special mention must go to Hannah
Collins and her victories in the 100m
individual medley, breastroke and but-
terfly over the course of the evening.
Next came the national BUCS indi-
vidual gala, in which Imperial swim-
mers had headed up to Sheffield to take
on some of the best talent in Britain,
including team GB and Olympic swim-
mers, as well as a world champion.
Needless to say this was a tough
ask for the team who all swum well,
with some of the new members of the
squad posting promising times to be
worked on, and relay teams that look
to be reaching finals in years to come.
Special mention must go to Thomas
Whitehead-Clarke finishing 21st in
the 200m butterfly, as well as Timo-
thy Marshall’s epic performance in the
50M backstroke.
Most notably, Imperial out-per-
formed all other individual London
universities, securing its place as the
best swimming university in London.
Following this was the BUCS team
event, where once again competi-
tion was tough, especially as the team
gained promotion to Division 1 last
year, and so were taking on seven of the
best teams in the country.
Despite some impressive swims,
including a personal best for Florain
Brock, a lack of fit swimmers for the
club lead to an unfortunate relegation,
and the team will now look favourite
to gain points in next year’s division 2
final.
Finally, last week came the second of
three ULU galas for the year, and with
such a convincing win behind them,
the team decided to field a more mod-
est team for the gala. All swimmers
performed exceptionally, with many
posting fantastic times, including Tom
Trimnell, Giuliano Sison, Cecily Bar-
ber and Amy McCallin; giving great
hope for the club next year.
IC swimming has a
whale of a term
Imperial managed to go on and win
the gala, meaning that they have now
won the inaugural ULU swimming
league with one competition to spare.
They hope to go and make a clean
sweep of the year, bringing a new tro-
phy home for the university. Next year
the team will be heading up to Shef-
field for another national competition,
as well as a possible trip to Europe to
compete in the IDEA league
The club would like to thank the
support they have received from their
coach Sergio Catania, as well as Fast-
Fins swim school and Jonas Grau.

FIXTURES & RESULTS in association with Sports
Partnership
off Katie towards the end of the sec-
ond half, continued superbly in this
role for the first part of the second
half with not just excellent saves but
some great kick passes as well. Katie
and Moira continued with the form we
had come to expect and set up some
lovely passes to Hilda and Eileen who
were making great space and really
threatening to score. With Imperial
improving with every kick and push,
St Mary’s onslaught slowed and IC got
steadily closer to getting on the score
sheet. Then, in the dying seconds of
the game, a well-deserved penalty saw
Cork woman Moira square up in front
of the posts. The grounds fell silent.
Everybody in Twickenham watched as
Moira stepped up and took the ball in
her hands. The ball sailed between the
posts as the final whistle blew and ap-
plause erupted.
The final score was “so-many-I-
stopped-counting” to one but the
team’s spirit was admirable. As we
limped back to the borrowed minibus,
downtrodden but not down -heart-
ened we vowed to one day return and
beat those four girls who carried that
team to a, let’s face it, fluky victory -
but not before we’d paid our fines in
the Union.
