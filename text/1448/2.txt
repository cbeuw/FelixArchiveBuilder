irgin Atlantic unveiled the first commercial passenger space-
ship in California’s Mojave Desert on Monday, in a ceremony
attended by the Governors of both California and New Mexico.
Already, over 300 individuals have booked a place aboard Space-
ShipTwo, which will take passengers to a maximum height of 110 kilometres
on a two hour round trip, of which only 6 minutes will be in zero-gravity. For
the privilege, they are prepared to pay $200,000 (£121,000). The spaceship is
built from lightweight carbon composite materials and powered by a hybrid
rocket motor.
So far, only 450 people have ever been into space, but Sir Richard Branson’s
Virgin Galactic enterprise is hoping to surpass that number within just one
year of the its first flight. They are not expected for another 18 months how-
ever, as both SpaceShipTwo and its carrier must undergo extensive tests be-
fore being fully operational. A futuristic-looking spaceport with a 3000 meter
long runway is also under construction in New Mexico to host SpaceShipTwo
and its successors.

T
he United Nations
Climate Change
Conference opened
onthe7thofDecem-
ber in Copenhagen, Denmark.
It is expected that representa-
tives of 192 countries will attend
the summit, which will last until
December 14th. Amongst these
areseveralheadsofstate,includ-
ing American President Barack
Obama and Chinese Premier
Wen Jiabao. Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen said in his opening statement
that the summit is an ‘opportunity the world cannot afford to miss’.
The European Union, which is keen to see countries committing themselves to
cuts, has already pledged to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions by 30% be-
low 1990 levels if an accord is reached, and 20% otherwise. In contrast the United
States has offered to reduce its own emissions by 17% below 2005 levels (which
amounts to a mere 1.3% below 1990 levels). Big developing country polluters,
including China and India, have promised to reduce their carbon intensity (CO2
emissions per unit of GDP), but both expect their total emissions to continue
rising. The process of reaching an agreement will be highly politicised, and
few experts believe a global, binding solution will be reached at the summit.

T
he Japanese government has announced another stimulus plan
worth ¥7.2 trillion (£48 billion), which will be directed towards
reducing unemployment and helping the environment.
The stimulus is designed to prevent Japan from slipping back into
a recession, after the country’s economy grew for the second straight quarter
between July and September. The return of deflation however has sparked
fears growth could stall. Furthermore, the strong yen has been hampering
Japan’s many exporters.
The deal, which was delayed by a week after a tiny but vocal coalition part-
ner in the newly elected Democratic party-led government demanded more
generous spending, will include ¥3.5 trillion of new spending. Of this, approx-
imately ¥800 billion will be directed towards environmentally related policies,
and ¥600 billion will be used for promoting employment.

At midnight on the 2nd December
2009, students from Imperial’s Civil
Engineering Department saw them-
selves as winners of a $15,000 donation
from JP Morgan. The prize money was
won in an online competition on the
bank’s website and will be handed over
to the charity El Salvador Project.
Over the summer, a group of Impe-
rial Civil Engineers travelled halfway
around the world to the small but trou-
blesome country of El Salvador to help
with the design and construction of
houses that are earthquake resistant.
Part of the venture was financed by
a $25,000 donation from JP Morgan,
which four student representatives of
the charity were able to win in a com-
petition in New York in April 2009,
making a very worthy presentation to
the bank’s board of judges.
Having beaten competitors from
amongst others Harvard and Stanford
universities back then, the Project was
again able to do outstandingly by out-
voting big favourites Playpumps In-
ternational in the recently won online
competition. It puts the total funding
to the Project by JP Morgan at $40,000
so far and gives hope for securing a
further $50,000 by May 2010, when the
final deadline of the online voting will
be enforced.
Students in Skempton were able to
breathe a sigh of relief when the first
deadline was passed and the El Sal-
vador Project was leading with a 56%
majority, competing against five other
charities from around the world. An
overwhelming 20,000 votes were cast
on the JP Morgan website.
Julian Bommer, Professor of Earth-
quake Risk Assessment, said: “Play-
pumps [International] is a heavily
funded charity and needed the support
far less than the El Salvador Project
does”.
Students in the race for $90,000
The team has recieved support from
throughout College. Neil Tsang, Lec-
turer in the Civil Engineering Depart-
ment, said: “I read the announcement
of the win with great interest. Good
work to the students. This amount of
money is not easy to get under the cur-
rent economic climate”.
The donation is considered a partic-
ularly welcoming gesture after the re-
cent landslides that struck El Salvador
and left at least 192 dead.
The disaster is recorded to have
swiped out entire towns and left tens
of thousands of people homeless.
Currently, the El Salvador Project
team, preparing to travel out to the
troubled spots this coming summer
is awaiting word from NGO REDES
about which unfortunate town hit by
the floods will be brought fortune upon
by receiving the physical aid work from
the Imperial Civil Engineers.
The campaign to acquire the most
number of votes saw calls being sent to
all Imperial Engineering faculty mem-
bers, urging them to go online and tick
the El Salvador Project in for the grand
financial contribution.
The ‘Give-it-Away’ competition by
JP Morgan is a major initiative by the
bank to enhance its image of social re-
sponsibility and shine light on its pre-
paredness to make charity donations.
The voting is still open on their web-
site and anyone is eligible to vote until
May next year.
Michael Davis, Chairman of the
Project also passed on his congratula-
tions to the team.
“Well done to all those involved and
for the way the win was coordinated,”
he said.
Workers from the Reconstruction
and Development Organization of El
Salvador (REDES), which works close-
ly with Imperial’s El Salvador Project,
were reportedly delighted to hear the
news of the recent win of the prize
money.
