felix FRIDAY 11 DECEMBER 2009
And so this is
Christmas
W
elcome to the last
issue of the term
for felix Games!
This week we’ve
got lots to get
through, so this editorial will be bliss-
fully short. This week, we look back
on a great year in gaming, some of our
writers’ highlights, and then give you
the chance to take home a lot of good-
ies courtesy of some really generous
games companies. It’s all good.
I mention my game of the year this
week too – the sublime Torchlight
which I only just managed to mention
in earlier in term. We’ve been talking
to Runic Games this month about their
game, and we’ll hopefully pop in an in-
terview early next term.
We’re also looking forward to Napo-
leon: Total War, also coming up next
term. 2010 should be a fine, fine year
indeed. But as I say in my Torchlight
piece, 2009 was a fantastic way to end the
decade. A truly great year, full of games
of all shapes and sizes, and some really
landmark moments. Look back to 1999,
and you’ll come over all excited about
the prospects of the next ten years. So do
take a moment to read these pages and
look back on the year.
Before I go and leave the rest of the
spread to the games themselves, con-
gratulations to Tching-yee Yip, Laksha-
na Huddar, Sam Hayhurst and Sophie
Lambrakis who all took home a copy
of Dragon Age for the 360. Hooray! And
speaking of ludicrous prizes, well... we’ve
got a few this week too.
Without further ado, then, let’s stop
there. Have a very Merry Christmas, and
hopefully I’ll see you in the new year.

A
manita Design are hand-
some and intelligent peo-
ple. Not only did they
release the superb and
engaging Machinarium
this year, a beautifully drawn and clev-
erly designed little puzzler that neatly
manages to be simple but entertain-
ing, but they even went one further to
give felix a free copy to give away to a
reader. I know! Talk about getting two
out of two right, eh? If you’d like to win,
send an e-mail to games.felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk by December 15th with the
subject line, “Do Robots Dance ‘The
Human’?”
, and tell us, readers; why
haven’t robots taken over the world
yet? Make us laugh and win a copy.
The closing date is Tuesday Decem-
ber 15th at 6pm. So get writing!
I
ndie gaming took a somewhat
curious turn this year, as Lu-
casArts announced they would
be launching a game designed
in an indie style, with a sharp
game concept, small budget and a set
visual style. The resulting Lucidity was
charming, if ultimately quite shallow,
and it remains to be seen if the mono-
lithic developer deemed it an avenue
worthy exploring. If they decide it was,
then 2010 could be a very interesting
year indeed, with more developers try-
ing to emulate the indie style and get a
portion of the increasingly huge mar-
ket for small, clever games.
In terms of true, blue indie games,
2009 was a mixed bag. The 12th IGF
awards list a variety of games, of which
three stand out in particular – Blueberry
Garden, the surreal and quite playable
platformer from one-man developer
Erik Svedang; Osmos, the hypnotic re-
verse-asteroids game; and the delectable
Machinarium. Machinarium was a par-
ticularhighlightformethisyear,withthe
sort of sky-high production values that
we associated with Braid last year. Tak-
ing the ‘Excellence In Visual Art’ award
without even trying, Machinarium is
beautiful, funny and well-designed, and
surely one of the best fully developed in-
die releases of the year.
As usual, 2009 was also a year of
amusing one-day-wonder web hits. fe-
lix Games readers wrote in praising the
likes of Don’t Shit Your Pants, You Only
Live Once and This Is The Only Level.
Out of all the games that were men-
tioned, though, Canabalt is probably the
runaway web hit of this year.
Ludicrously simple, coming from the
superb Experimental Gameplay Project,
Canabalt’s one-button, beautifully pre-
sented mechanics swept across the net
before most websites had realised what
was going on. More of this sort of thing
next year, please.
2009 in indie gaming
Win! The indie puzzler superhero Machinarium!
Win Stuff On Good Old Games!
Win! Santa’s Sack
A
s you can tell, we’ve
got a fair few competi-
tions this week. Thanks
to the beautiful people
out there in Gameland,
developers and publishers have given
felix Games prize after prize so we
can give a few readers a truly excellent
Christmas. You’ll see the competitions
scattered throughout our special dou-
ble-page this week.
On top of all that, we’ve also got a
bumper crop of bits and pieces to give
away in our Santa’s Sack draw. One
lucky reader will bag:
• A copy of Dragon Age: Origins
for the XBox 360
• A copy of Blood Bowl for the
XBox 360
• A copy of World of Zoo for the
PC
• A woolly Mario hat
• A sexy Mario And Sonic At The
Olympic Games T-Shirt
Massive thanks go out to Electronic
Arts, Sega and THQ for supplying
prizes to our big draw. One lucky run-
ner up will also receive the Mario hat
and T-Shirt courtesy of those lovely
folks at Sega, too.
Phew. So what do you have to do to
take home this particular smorgas-
bord of digital goodness? Well, simply
e-mail games.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
In your email, simply tell us; if a
videogame character had to replace
Santa, which one would you send?
Most outlandish explanations of why
Kirby is a responsible member of so-
ciety (or maybe just whoever makes
us laugh) will take home the delicious
metaphorical bacon that is the Santa
Sack O’ Games. Good luck!
The closing date for this, and all com-
petitions from this issue is Tuesday De-
cember 15th at 6pm. Winners will be
contacted before Christmas, and we’ll do
our best to get those prizes to you in time
for the holidays.
Many thanks to the games developers, publishers and PR agencies that
helped Felix Games out this week. Thanks especially to Cathy Orr and
Ember Wardrop, Sophie Orlando, Kat Osman, Lukasz Kukawski, Won-
der Russell, and a particularly huge thanks to the folks over at Amanita
Games. Merry Christmas, everyone.
N
o, no, you can’t win the
whole website. But we
have got some games to
give away, which is just as
good. To celebrate a good year at GoG.
com, the nice people there have got a
game of your choosing up for grabs for
five readers. Huzzah!
Why are we excited about GoG.com?
Good Old Games release the classics of
yesteryear, the ones that are nearly im-
possible to find anywhere, for proper
budget prices and without any DRM
whatsoever.
Whether it’s a recently buried clas-
sic like Psychonauts, or older gems like
Fallout or games I’d forgotten existed,
like Rise Of The Triad, there’s some-
thing for everyone. Although retailers
like Steam do their best to get budget
re-releases into their catalogue, no-
one’s done it to quite the depth GoG.
com has.
To get your hands on a copy, e-mail
games.felix@imperial.ac.uk and let
us know; if you could re-release an
old game, which one would it be and
why? Make us stroke our chinsand
nod sagely at your wis-
dom to win.
Closing
date: Tues-
day De-
cember
15th at
6pm.
