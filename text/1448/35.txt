The felixSport League Table
Returns in time for Christmas!
Continued from Back Page
It has finally arrived. After painstak-
ing deliberation over the format and
scoring system, the phoenix that is the
felixSport league table has risen from
the ashes of its predecessor to grace
you with its presence.
The format is simple; only BUCS
teams that have played over 5 games
are considered. Each win grants you
5 points, 2 for a draw and you suffer a
penalty of 4 points for every loss you
concede. Some would say the reason
some teams exist at Imperial is to at-
tain as high a position as possible in
the infamous felixSport League Table.
To extrapolate this view, we are pro-
viding an incentive for you to play all
your games and are thus now enabling
walkovers to contribute to the table, at
the end of the season. So no slacking
guys and girls. This is BUCS after all
Though Tennis Men’s 1sts cannot
replicate last year’s success of winning
all their games, can they top this year’s
table? After Rugby Men’s 1sts hor-
rid season with the cream of the crop
in the BUCS South Premiership B,
they are once again topping the tables
with an impressive 7 victories from 8
games. The Medicals will aim to im-
prove on last year and by this year-end
they occupy 3 of the top 10 spots. In
contrast they do occupy 6 of the bot-
tom 10 places.
Have fun reading and debating with
your friends from rival sports and
teams and please ensure you get your
results to fixtures live or Alissa Ayling,
the Sports Partnership Administrator
up in the SAC as soon as you can after
your games so we can have an as up to
date table as possible. Stay winning all!
Enthralling Encounter between College and Medics
giving a goal after the Medicals centre
back climbed over the College centre
back and new boy David Sapin.
From then on, College controlled
80% of the possession of the game and
had several half chances that were dealt
with confidently by the solid back four
of the Medicals. Strong play on the left
by both Theocharis Tofis and Matthieu
Vallin caused moments of uncertainty
amongst the Medicals back line but
were eventually dealt with.
Going into half time 1-nil down,
Botchway delivered a team talk that
summarised that the previous half as
‘frankly not good enough’ and though
they had the upper hand in technical
ability, ‘the medics want it more and
deserve to be winning’.
After three big wins in BUCS, a
disappointing 1-0 loss against King’s
Medicals 1st XI; a team who had
achieved zero points until then, the
previous week, had piled on the pres-
sure to Imperial’s 1st XI who now must
achieve maximum points to stay in
contention in the ULU league.
The second half was much of the
same, with College dominating pos-
sessing and probing the final third.
The pressure on the Medicals finally
defeated them after a strongly hit free
kick by Leslie Eshun ricocheted off
many players and fortunately fell to
Matthieu Vallin who stabbed it home
to bring his tally to 4 this season.
College, with even more momentum
than before knocked on the door many
times but though demoralised, the
Medicals’ defence was impermeable.
Ex College player Karim Amer con-
trolled the tempo of the game when
he had the ball, causing panic amongst
College’s players who dove in reck-
lessly creating space for Amer to feed
in the Medicals strikers. This almost
was rewarded with a goal after the
Medicals striker beat the offside trap
to place a stinging shot, which brought
a fingertip, save from Botchway.
1-a-piece at full-time and with light
quickly fading, the referee decided to
play an extra time with two periods of
5 minutes. The Medicals almost got
the winner in the first half of extra time
after again the Medicals striker utilised
the absence of linsemen as well the
high defensive line of College to race
through, only to put his shot over.
The best chance of the match came
in the second half of extra time where
central midfielder Dion Benincasa de-
livered a cross field ball to Vallin who
then crossed it in the box for Nathan
Ferrol to flick it onto Eshun who un-
luckily put it wide after being put
through one-on-one with the Medicals
keeper.
Immortals yet to win with heavy
loss to Brighton Tsunamis
The Imperial Immortals hit the road
again on Sunday for their third game of
the season, trekking to the south coast
to face an experienced Brighton side.
Battling a bigger squad and at times
the elements, the injury-hit Immortals
persevered bravely with a threadbare
squad of nineteen, but were unable to
prevent a Tsunami victory.

After last ditch motivational team
talks from both captains the game was
to be decided on penalties. Tofis’ pen-
alty crept in after the Medicals keeper
got a hand to it. At 1-apiece, Benincasa
hit the post and the Medicals capital-
ised to go 2-1 up. Powerful penalties
from Eshun and Nathan and a miss
from the Medicals brought the games
level at 3-3.
The final penalty from College went
to Jonathan Hill, who delivered a reli-
able performance after being switched
to centre back after the injury earlier
on in the game.
He topped this off by placing his
penalty to the top right hand corner of
the goalkeeper’s posts to send the now
onlooking 4th and 5th XI players to
pandemonium.
The Medicals final penalty was
dragged wide and College emerged
victorious again after an exciting cup
tie. Imperial College Medicals proved
to be stiff opposition and credit must
go to the club after seemingly solved
their grave defensive issues of previous
years.
This game has left both clubs with
an inkling as to the excitement next
year’s Varsity match could bring. Col-
lege’s next opponents are league lead-
ers SOAS 1st XI, two take place at the
beginning of next term, a week after
their much awaited league fixture.

On offence, it was a war of attrition
as running backs Daniel Jones and
Alex Karvelas found yards were hard-
earned against an organised Brighton
defence. In the first quarter the Im-
mortals enjoyed an early turnover as
linebacker Charles Kennedy forced a
fumble, but the offence was unable to
capitalise on the error and fumbled the
ball back. The Tsunami scored a touch-
down on the next play but Kennedy
again stepped up and blocked the fol-
lowing extra point attempt.
The Immortals answered with some
good offensive plays, including a ca-
reer high 17-yard dash by Daniel Jones,
a 30-yard pass by quarterback Edward
Fisher to wide receiver Jacob Murphy
and a 20-yard kickoff return by Geof-
frey Chow. None was enough to gain
points but good work by the defence,
especially the linebacking corps of Ri-
chard Giles-Carlsson, Rob Wolstern-
holme, Artur Jarazbek and Dexter
Valencia meant the Immortals went to
the half time only 12-nil down.
In the second half the Immortals
were hit early as Brighton ran the kick-
off back for a score and then followed
this with a touchdown on their next
possession. The reeling Immortals
settled back to playing tough defence
and the effort was rewarded when de-
fensive end Zubin Jehangir sacked the
Tsunami quarterback in his own end-
zone for a safety. The defence contin-
ued to inflict turnovers as Kennedy
and Valencia forced more fumbles and
free safety Arjav Trivedi picked his sec-
ond interception of the season.
Despite some strong play by the of-
fensive line, in particular Simon Arch-
er and Nick Tovell, the Immortals were
unable to add to the score and eventu-
ally fell to 2-33.
The loss leaves the Immortals still
looking for their first win but they
can be proud of their continuing de-
velopment and emerging playmaking
abilities.
MVP: Dexter Valencia (7 tackles, 1
forced fumble)
