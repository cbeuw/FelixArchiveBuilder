British Title
By P. F. Hunt
On Saturday, 27th February,
39 teams from colleges through-
out the country arrived at U.L.U.
lor the Inter-Collegiate Cham-
pionship of Great Britain. Among
these were four L C . teams the
first two both being among the
eight seeds* The teams were di-
vided into thirteen pools and each
team fought the other teams in
their pool on a league basis. The
1st, 2nd and 3rd I.C. teams won
their pools and the 2nd team then
had a bye to the quarter-finals.
The first team beat Croydon Col-
lege of Technology to reach the
quarter-finals, while the 3rd team
were narrowly beaten by Q.M.C.
1st who were eventually to reach
the final. In the quarter-final

THE SOCCER CLUB
AT MOTSPUR
By R. E . Grundy
Great words indeed! On
Saturday the 13th Marcft, eleven
men of I.C. are representing the
College in the London University
Reserves Clip.
The I.C. Re'Sfcrve team must
surely be one of the strongest in
the competition and have strolled
almost casually into the final.
Due to the fact that seven first
team players are included in the
team they start firm favourites
against a weaker Battersea team.
Even when one considers the freak
number of injured which have
occurred in the past fortnight, it
cannot be foreseen that this team
will be beaten.
Deadly Crisp
The strength of the team un-
doubtedly lies in the skill and
deadliness of Crisp at inside for-
ward and the graft of Morland,
Smart and Cooper at half-back.
This combined with the experi-
ence of Price and Wojtowicz in
defence produces a fine combina-
tion. Kemp, who has been scoring
by the dozen in recent matches is
an effective goalscorer and indeed
scored a hat-trick in the semi-
finals. The main weak spot in the
team will, if anything, be over-
confidence; but under the enthu-
siastic leadership of Price, one can
be sure that this will not happen.
The team will be chosen from:
Wojtowicz, Hariss, Price, Cooper,
Millington, Johnson, Moreland,
Bentham, Crisp, Kemp, Smart,
Luxton.
The kick-off will be 11 a.m.
and free coaches will leave at
9.30 a.m.
Win or lose, supporters will be
ensured of an entertaining after-
noon, and evening.
Q.M.C. 1st beat I.C. 2nd, while
I.C. 1st beat Battersea 1st. The
I.C. team then beat Wolverton 1st
in the semi-final and so for the
second year, running met Q.M.C.
in, the final. This match pro-
vided some good Judo with I.C.
the winners by two contests to
one.
Even on Wednesday
In the Wednesday afternoon
leagues the Judo club has con-
tinually had to field weak teams
due to injury, seminars and the
like. Despite this the first team
beat all the other colleges and
came second only to the Police
Cadets. The other teams all
distinguished themselves and even
the 6th team beat other colleges
1st teams.
Rugby,
Anon.
On Saturday 27th February, the
Rugby Club enterta'ned the
" Ecole des Arts et les Manu-
factures " at Harlington, the game
resulting in a draw three points
each.
The game itself was rather a
shambles with I.C. playing with
fourteen men for the whole match
due to the treasurer's fondness of
sleep. The opposing numbers
varied from fourteen to fifteen
due to the French wing-forward's
insistence on being carried off
after each of his frequent injuries.
After the match the I.C. captain
was presented with a bottle of
Cognac which was used for
medicinal purposes at the inter-
Badminton.
Leage Wins
By M . Fitzgerald
The I.C. teams have completed
their league fixtures showing the
Club in an excellent position. The
men's team retained the U.L.U.
league championship to four
years. The mixed team won its
league for the first time.
The men's league was clinched
at the end of February when I.C.
defeated Northern Poly 9-0. The
magnitude of the victory was
rather surprising considering that
Northern Poly had defeated every
other team in the league. As can
be seen from the table below, the
national in the afternoon, and in-
deed had its effect in the evening
when he entertained the Union
with some very good solo acts.
championship was extremely
close, rubbers for-against deciding
the final places: â€”
P W L F A P
I.C. 10 9 1 77 13 18
North'n Poly 10 9 1 55 35 18
King's 9 8 1 62 19 16
The I.C. team consisted of D.
Foster, D. Fisher, C. Woodward,
G. Simnet, R. Clements and M .
Fitzgerald.
The mixed team completed
their programme with a comfort-
able 8-1 victory over QMC, and
this kept their unbeaten record
along with the championship.
Throughout the season, the team
consisted of Forster, Fisher and
Fitzgerald and Pat Lee, Delphine
Woker and Ramela.
On Wednesday Feb. 24th an
I.C. team consisting of only 2
first, 3 second and 1 third team
players trounced Oxford Univer-
sity II 7-2, thus giving an indica-
tion of the allround strength of
the club this reason.
