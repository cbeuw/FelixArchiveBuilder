DOORS
A bar to education
We, the undersigned, are rust cast in the common mould of
ordinary, uncultured engineers. Oh, no, Sir\ We maintain a keen
interest in current affairs, and active social conscience, and a healthy
contempt for science.
Only the other month one of us read a newspaper. We noticed
that the conditions for entry to University was a matter for public
concern. Whereupon we decided that it was our moral duty to investi-
gate the problem at IC. Has it not been stated, by no lesser person
than Lord Robbin Somebody, that " No door should be left unopened
to the qualified student?"
So we carried out a survey on doors—external doors, that is.
For we considered that more students would come to College, if only,
in the confusion of the morning after, they could negotiate the current
complex of closed glass doors.
Our results tell a sorry tale. The
Chemistry Department, with four
external doors, has only one
opening in each direction. Exactly
similar is the behaviour of the
four doors on the north side of
the Mech Eng Building. Outside
the Physics Block, we observed,
one unfortunate fellow try twelve
doors in a row and then fall
screaming and frothing on the
ground; we pacified him and
helped him into a ventilator shaft.
Thus, we deplore the difficulty
of entry into IC Departments, and
would recommend to frustrated
entrants that they apply to the
University of Accra, which, it is
reported, has no doors at all.
Yours openly,
ROY CLARKE,
DAVID C. LARBALESTIER,
ROGER LHARKER,

P.S.—We regret to report that
during the survey, D. C. Larbale-
stier was scissored by two invisible
glass doors. Fruit and flowers to
Hammersmith Hospital, please.
Landladies
Discriminate
Dear Sir,
In your last issue Chris Lam-
pard in his " Foreign Affairs "
column, mentioned that students
at Oxford had conducted a survey
of landladies, and found that 62
per cent, discriminate against
African and Asian students. He
Wonders what a similar survey in
London would reveal.
His question is a good one. No
such survey has ever been con-
ducted in London, so far as I can
discover.
The University of London
Lodgings Bureau sometime ago
counted the proportion of their
landladies who were known to
discriminate, and found this was
25 per cent. The real figure is
almost certainly more.
Last term an I.C. lodgings
bureau was run by Miss Good-
child at the Domestic Bursar's
Office. She tells me that out of
60 landladies, 54 discriminated;
she only succeeded in finding ac-
commodation for 6 out of 52
coloured students who applied to
her.
The work involved in conduct-
ing a survey of landladies is
enormous and one wonders
whether it is worth the effort for
it is not possible to re-educate
landladies on their doorsteps.
The l.C. Society for Racial
Equality has just received the
Registrar's permission to conduct
a survey of the coloured students
at I.C. to find out: —
(1) The extent of discrimina-
tion.
(2) // they find it a serious
problem.
(3) Suggestions for constructive
student action.
We have already conducted a
pilot survey. I should like to
take this opportunity to ask the
students concerned to cooperate
in answering the questionaire that
they will soon receive.
Yours faithfully
ROY CLARKE

Congratulations
Sir,
Imperial College Union is to be
congratulated on disproving its
critics; not only was last Thurs-
day's meeting quorate, but quite
decisively weagreed to join N.U.S.
It is to be hoped that the Execu-
tive will make an immediate ap-
plication so that I.C. membership
can take effect from the Easter
Council ofN.US. This raises the
question of delegates and a
N.U.S. Secretary; I suggest that
these be elected from a Union
General Meeting or by a College
ballot.
This was a democratic decision
of the Union, and the counter-
moves of two years ago that
frustrated and discredited the
Union must not be allowed to re-
occur.
Yours etc.,
SEAN DUNNE,
(Physics P.G.)
Dear Sir,
In your edition of February 24th you drew the attention of
your readers for the second time this year your feelings and some of
your thoughts about Sennet, the newspaper of the University of
London. As some of your facts are suspect, perhaps you would allow
me to point out one or two things which you should know.
In your editorial you mention sensationalism and you will re-
member that in previous editorials you have complained of this
sensationalism being directed at unfortunate topics. If, as you seem
to suggest, you think sales are the only criteria of the success of a
newspaper, then Sennet is by all standards successful.
The Sennet Board of Governors has laid down a policy of the
paper and any editor is required to abide by this policy. As to
the Board badgering Sennet, I think you will find that they have
taken an interest in the paper but have certainly not interfered in any
way with the Editor's proper functions. Neither have they changed
their minds.
Your comments concerning staff and organisation were both
obvious and trite. If you, Sir would release some of your staff to work
in Imperial College for Sennet I am quite sure the editor, who is
responsible through the Managing Director to the Board for all staff,
would be only too delighted. When you say the editor should be
appointed for a year, I would point out that Mr. Marsden left of his
own free will, Miss Roll's appointment was not ratified by the Board,
who together with the Presidents' Council supported my action, which
was taken on the basis of a previous decision of Council, and Mr.
Wade to Whom we were most grateful could only for personal reasons
be editor for five issues.
I trust that this clarifies some of your misconceptions and ir,
closing I would like to point out that Sennet has sold mer the first
12 issues this year, an average of 1000 copies per week at Imperial
College, Also it is not my intention to comment on your remarki
concerning myself, because, Sir, logic appears to be one of your
weaker points.
Yours faithfully,
ANTHONY J. BERRY,
(President of ULU)
Ed.—I have approached various members of the Felix Staff;.none
are prepared to work for Sennet!
Sir,
Price
Vindicated
Dear Sir,
It seems to me that in reporting
the proceedings of the last Union
meeting you were not aware of
the real reason behind Mr. Price's
action in vacating the chair and
submitting his gown to Deputy
President Barry Mair. To say
that Mr. Price's chairing was poor
is wholly untrue; the fact is that
the President took this action to
defend himself against challenges
and allegations from the flloor.
As Kearns withdrew his motion
Price did not subsequently speak.
Yours etc.,
GEORGE BARAMKI

Frustrated
New Atlas
Dear Sir,
Mr. Roy Clarke's ignorance of
Southern Africa is nicely illustra-
ted by his incorrect description of
the territory between the Limpopo
and Cape Agulhas as South
Africa.
If this Philistine is to continue
as the Secretary of ICSFRE, then
you might at least let him share
Mr. Lampard's proposed new
atlas.
Yours sincerely,
GRAHAM CLARKE
Dear Sir,
It was found impossible to ad-
vertise the Huxley Society's meet-
ing of Tuesday 23rd February on
the Events Board in the Union
because, apparently, Stan had run
out of letters to do so.
Perhaps a " more letters for
Stan " fund might do something
to ease the situation?
Yours faithfully,
J. ANDREWS
(Publicity Officer, Huxley Soc.)
(Stan was last week presented
with some extra letters found in
Weeks Hall—Ed.)
