12 FELI X
REGGIE Cont. from p. 1
Two telephone " engineers " entered King's at
8.08 to put the phones out of order, only to find
this feat impossible. At 8.12 a small van
appeared carrying an assortment of tools, whose
presence might have been difficult to explain to
any police in the vicinity.
Assuring the security guards that all they
wanted was a large lion, chained to the balcony
railings, four members of the assault party
climbed on to the parapet and proceeded to saw
through an inch-thick anchor chain. No trace
was left of the six used hacksaw blades.
By 8.30 the lion was free. But it needed six
people to carry it to the waking van. However,
since King's Union did not open until 9.0, the
party had to wait in the forecourt.
Only a couple of Kingsmen witnes:; 1 Reggie's
departure through the Union gates at 9.01. At IC
Union Reggie was manhandled into the lift to be
hidden away until due to make its appearance in
the Union bar to be exhibited for an hour and be
baptised in the traditional manner.

EVICTIONS AT BATTERSEA
Seven students have been
thrown out of the Battersea Halls
for letting off crow scarers. They
were given a week's notice to quit.
Apparently more than the neces-
sary number owned up in the
false hope that the greater num-
bers would mean lighter punish-
ments.

The International Union of
Students condemns those who try
to prevent " politically motivated
vandalism" (N.B. This is quoted!)
on University campuses in South
Africa.
POLICEMAN STRUCK BY
FALLING BOTTLE
A passing policeman was struck
by a bottle (Guiness?) descending
from a window at Dublin Univer-
sity. Workmen complain that they
live in constant fear of such mis-
siles and as a result the Dean
directed that no window may be
opened.

advertisements for current events,

for listening in are quite straight-
forward — an amplifier and
speaker, a length of wire to tap
into the system, and a room in
Southside.
A large number of people have
shown interest in the scheme, par-
ticularly since a recent advertising
campaign and demonstration to
Hall members. Any enquiries
should be made to Mike Hutton

WILSON BEHEADED
Manchester College of Tech-
nology scored a notable success
for their Rag Week when they
decapitated the Waxwork of
Harold Wilson at Madame Tus-
saud's. One student hid on the
premises until after closing time,
removed the head, and left by a
fire escape. The head was then
stored in a 'fridge at their Union.
EXPLORATION
REVIEW
The Exploration Society's an-
nual journal, "The Expiration
Review," is due to appc.ir next
week.
It has both accounts of last
year's expeditions and a large
number of articles written by out-
siders, more than ever before.
This review contains something
for everyone—for the would-be
explorer there are articles by
bodies that will help, and the
armchair explorer can travel with
us without the hardship.

Stamp thieves have struck the
Union letter rack, and are caus-
ing both addressees and the
Union considerable inconveni-
ence, and sometimes unnecessary
expense when letters have to be
forwarded. Such offenders have
been asked to refrain, otherwise
action will have to be taken to
apprehend and punish them.

Mines Union, returned to IC
Sunday afternoon, 28 February,
from a week of winter sunshine in
Zell am See as guests of the
Loeben School of Mines in
Austria. They report that they
spent a very enjoyable time at a
European mining students' semi-
nar, and look very well on it!
Council has authorized Stan,
the Union porter, to remove
posters placed in the Union.letter
rack.
During the next five to ten
years £30,000 will be spent in re-
placing the furniture in the Union
lower lounge. Professional advice
is being sought in this matter
from the Royal College of Art.
This weekend (13-14 March)
the B2 rugger team, "von
Spiero's XI plus 4," formerly the
"International All Stars," go to
Paris to play a University team
there. They are receiving no
grant from the Union and so are
footing the £6 10s. Od.-each bill
themselves.

If a new events board does not
appear in the Union building
within the next fortnight, then it
seems unlikely that the present
plans ever will be implemented.
The manufacturer has been given
an ultimatum for its delivery.

It appears that IC will be able to
send five representatives to the bi-

Goldsmiths' College over Easter
on an ad hoc basis. Council will
decide the method of election and

Our Food
lo Danger
In spite of its size, Britain is
in fact in a very important posi-
tion concerning trade, as she is
geographically at the centre of the
land masses. But with existing
forms of cargo transport she is
very dependent on the Suez and
Panama canals, and on the
various refuelling airports en
route to such Commonwealth
countries as Australia. In case
of war it would be very easy for
an enemy power to cut off our
food supplies.
Dr. Barnes Wallis, famous for
his " Dam Buster Bomb," was
speaking to a packed Main
Physics Lecture Theatre in Gene-
ral Studies last week on " Com-
monwealth Communications." He
is a man who, without a Univer-
sity education, has through per-
sonal experience made some tre-
mendous strides in Engineering.
In his lecture he talked about two
of his pet researches, cargo sub-
marines and long-range aircraft,
the latter with a special emphasis
on variable wings.
These submarines would do
away with the problem of canals,
as there is a perfectly good route
to the Pacific via the North Pole.
Thus Britain's food supply would
not suffer by another Suez inci-
dent.
He then went on to consider the
problems of long-range aircraft
and a concept of his called iso-
thermal flight. By increasing the
height of the aircraft as the speed
is increased the airframe can be
kept at the required constant
temperature. From there to the
swing-wing type aircraft, which
Dr. Wallis had been working on
until he reached the stage of
building a manned model, was
but a short step.
But at this stage the Govern-
ment abandoned the project, and
he tried to obtainfinancefrom the
USA. The Americans would not
give him any money, however,
and stole the idea, from which the
present TFX has been developed.
He illustrated this part of the
lecture with a film of his experi-
ments on a Cornish airfield.
