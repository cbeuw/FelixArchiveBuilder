Warbey on Vietnam
Both Hanoi and Saigon claim to be the legal governments of
the whole of Vietnam, while at the same time recognising the seven-
teenth parallel as only a temporary dividing line. The Viet-Cong are
composed of Buddhists, Roman Catholics, peasants and intellectuals,
as well as the followers of Ho Chi Minh, "who may be termed
Communists."'
These were the main points made by Mr. Bill Warbey, M.P.,
at a joint meeting of all the political societies, organised by the CND
group. At this stage few people could argue with his somewhat
controversial views on Vietnam, if only because they lacked his exten-
sive knowledge of South-East Asia. But then he went on to explain
who he felt was to blame—'this
turned out to be none other than
the United States.
The U.S. had refused to sign
the Geneva Agreement on Viet-
nam, had backed the Ngo Dinh
Diem and other governments in
the South in preventing reunifi-
cation of the country, and were
now hotting up the war at the
very moment when peace nego-
tiations are in progress.
These accusations provoked re-
action from Mr. Anand, the SCC
Chairman, but seemed to go down
well with the Liberals in the per-
son of Edward Fortune.
Finally, when the chairman,
Professor Matthews, asked for a
short question to finish the meet-
ing, Les Massey, former IC Union
Secretary and now Chairman of
South Kensington Labour Party,
asked a five-point question which
left the speaker firmly convinced
that this was the spokesman of the
IC Conservatives.

IRISH DEBATING TOUR
FLOURISHING
RAILWAY
Once again the Railway
Society is in the fortunate posi-
tion of being oversubscribed for
its locomotive-driving outing on
the Brentford branch at the be-
ginning of next term. This bi-
annual event is always one of the
most popular in their active
calendar; and members, who
have not yet paid their £2 are re-
minded that they should do so
quickly to make sure of their
place.
Another forthcoming long-
distance visit will be to the
Ffestiniog Railway and other
narrow-guage railways in North
Wales during the Easter vacation.
Further details of this and other
Railway Society functions are
posted on their noticeboard out-
side the Concert Hall.

Damn You, Ireland
On the evening of Monday, 22nd February, a gaggle of debaters
left for Ireland. The party, consisting of President David Reich,
Roger Kitching, Hilary Thompson, and our Celtic interpreter, Ewen
Smith, was soon being whisked towards Belfast.
Tuesday gave a little time for sightseeing, and an analysis of the
complex politics of Queen's University. In the evening they debated
the motion, " Damn you, Ireland." Patrick O'Donovan proposing
was not as inflamatory as might have been expected.
Gerry Lawless, communist and ex-IRA general, in opposing
advocated workers' solidarity and the rejection of the Roman Catho-
lic Church's views on pre-marital intercourse. Ewan Smith, second-
ing with a rare national fervour, damned Ireland by pointing out
that the English had been just as unfriendly to the Scots.
RELEVANT REICH
David Reich, seconding Lawless, took a more relevant line than
his rebel colleague—pointing out that Ireland had nothing to be
ashamed of. The motion was defeated.
A minor crunch involving their hired cars (stationary) delayed
them slightly but they still managed to reach Dublin by early after-
noon.
The motion at Trinity College,
rank with Englishmen, was that
"This house agrees with the voters
of Leyton." There were eight
speakers with David Reich speak-
ing third for the proposition. He
argued that the Leyton electorate
had the right to change its mind
and reject an unsatisfactory gov-
ernment.
And so to Cork with driver
Reich narrowly avoiding three
cyclists, one donkey, one Mer-
cedes and a cow. Ewan Smith had
to leave to be back at I.C. by
Thursday, but the party main-
tained its gaiety to tackle the
motion that "the Stars and Stripes
are as big a threat to world peace
as the Hammer and Sickle," at
University College.
FOOTBALL MATCH
They entered the debating
chamber to find a crowd worthy
of a football match, Gaelic cheers
rang round the theatre. Pax
Hibernica never reigned through-
out the jousting. A speaker from
Galway led a rousing chorus of
"Galway Bay" from the plat-
form, and David Reich, opposing,
told a dirty joke he had learnt
from the Indian Charge d'Affaires
in Dublin. Roger Kitching battled
manfully for the proposition, but
a lapsus linguae caused the most,
unnecessary mirth.
Hilary Thompson talked about
rape in Texas. "Insult to the
House " someone screamed, and
the motion was defeated. A bi-
national crowd retired to a hotel
to drink and sing till early
morning.

EASY TO MIX
The word is spreading. The
Southside Stomps on February
24th was a really swinging affair.
Its success was entirely due to the
people who came along (about
300 of them). They were inter-
esting, lively people, some in
couples, some in groups; some
dancing and some listening to the
jazz.
In the atmosphere of the
Stomps it is easy to mix—perhaps
that's why the many women who
come along are older, more in-
telligent and more attractive than
the average Hop-goer.
There are only two more
Stomps this term, the next tonight
(Wednesday). You can't afford to
miss another Stomp . . . And any-
way you make it a success!
