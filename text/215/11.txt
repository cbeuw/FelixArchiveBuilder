FELI X II
Hyde Park Road Relay
Poor
Display
by I.C
By A. W. Bishop
Unfortunately, the only word
which adequately describes the
l.C. performance is "catastro-
phic." A team which should have
finished in about 92 minutes,
giving a place in the first 15,
finished 35th (the lowest place
ever by an I.C. team) in 95 min.
1 sec. (There were 88 entries).
H Dickson was badly "roughed
up" in the mass start, and the
effort to make up lost ground
proved too much, and he blew at
about half way. A Cope then
returned a reasonable time, pul-
ling back many places, but A.
Walker produced a bad time on
the third lap. Dave Bonham was
the replacement for D. Reaves on
the fourth lap, and then D. May
ran the penultimate lap. He had
a badly injured foot, but it was
hoped that it would last out the
three mile road course. It didn't,
and his time tells the remainder of
the story.
A. Bishop continued the trend
on the final lap, with an unimpres-
sive time. However, the complete
team could well be here again
year; to redeem the College's
prestige.
Record Time
by Leeds
On the bright side, Leeds just
managed to pull off an exciting
victory over Borough Road
Training College in record time.
The organisation, under D.
Reaves, was well up to the excep-
tionally high standard now ex-
pected each year at the world's
largest "relay race.

In line with the policy of im-
proving this event year by year,
we intend next year to invite
teams from many European Uni-
versities, and so raise the standard
of this event from National to
International.

Nearly 1400 managers and assistant managers have attended
residential courses atthe British Iron and Steel Federation's
own management college in Warwickshire. Courses are
designed to enable men from different departments and
companies to see the steel industry in perspective, to
increasetheirtechnical and commercial knowledge, to meet
leading figures in the industry and to practise committee
work. These courses also help them to develop their capacity
for solving management problems, both human and tech-
nical and occasionally to study specialist techniques, such
as Industrial Market Research and Systems Analysis.
The Steel industry regards management as both an Art and
a Science. In addition to its intensive programme of manage-
ment training, the Federation is currently engaged in a
substantial programme of research into management
problems within the industry.
