EXPULSION FROM HALL.
A gentleman i s to be expelled
from T i z a r d H a l l f o r one week at the
end of term as a r e s u l t of lodging a
guest i n h i s room a f t e r the Aero k.'
Club dinner. The guest was a c e r t a i n
J.Edge who, as a r e s u l t of the f e s t -
i v i t i e s was unable to get home. I t
i s a p i t y t h a t people don't appeal
to the wardens i n these cases - I am
sure they would be most sympathetic
and no r u l e s would have been broken.

the main issue o u t l i n i n g the proto-

up i n the f i r s t place, i t was actu-
a l l y flown on F r i d a y i n honour of
the Hockey Club's win on Wednesday,
A l l good t h i n g s must come t o an end,
however, because i t was taken down
at mid-day and was replaced by the
Union Jack i n r e c o g n i t i o n of the
death of the President of A u s t r i a .
The Hockey Club always seem to be
unlucky - l a s t March they won the
ULU s i x - a - s i d e tournament; there
was no f l a g , however, because i t
was a l l a f t e r the end of term.

'On Thursday afternoon the snow
i n the quad was too good to miss.
Rugger boys, Union O f f i c i a l s , and x
Zoology and Botany turned out i n
force i n t h e i r noble e f f o r t to help
the snow c l e a r i n g . Unfortunately
some people had to go onto the roof
and p e l t the general p u b l i c by the
Albert H a l l . One o l d woman at l e a s t
was observed to have been knocked
over. L i t t l e b e t t e r was the-
' tr.eat-
-ment afforded to E d i t o r Walker.
S t r o l l i n g through the quad, i n h i s
usual suspicious manner, he was h i t
by a f i v e tonner on the t i p of h i s
r a i s e d umbrella. This was, not
u n n a t u r a l l y shattered. In answer t o
h i s demands f o r Union payment,
r i o t q u e l l i n g Mair was heard to say:
" I think we s h a l l have t o ban Walker
from the Quad; anyway, he didn't
buy the t h i n g from us i n the f i r s t
place."

DRAM. SOC. SHOW UP ROBBINS.
In defiance of the Robbins'
committee's lead weight, proposals,
Dram. Soc. has spontaneously united
w i t h the Royal College of Art and
the Royal College of Music to
produce a play f e s t i v a l . T h i s w i l l
be held In the RCA's Gulbenkian
H a l l on the evenings of March 16th.-
- 18th. , and t i c k e t s are to" be on
sale i n the Union. Star-spot could
be ROM's operetta, which they have
w r i t t e n themselves.

UNION LOUNGE FURNITURE.
Design-conscious students should
see Barry Mair, Vice-President of
IC Union as soon as p o s s i b l e i f
they have any strong ideas about the
r e f u r n i s h i n g of the Union Lounge.
On Frida3?- he w i l l be opening
consultations with the RCA's design
people - so act now i f yoii don't
want to be surrounded by G-Plan
and Picasso reproductions.

IMPERIAL WIRELESS?
Tlumqurs have r e c e n t l y been c i r c -
- u l a t i r i g around College that a
s e r i e s of p i r a t e radio s t a t i o n s are
centred i n the H a l l s of Residence.
Apparently the idea s t a r t e d i n
S e l k i r k : "wonderful Radio T i z a r d "
soon followed. I t seems that the
broadcasting s t a t i o n s have been an
u n q u a l i f i e d success, w i t h many
r e s i d e n t s now asking f o r a l i n e t o
t h e i r rooms so that they, t o o , may
put t h e i r records and tapes on the
