Will it all seem worthwhile 5 years from n

?
At Turner & Newall a man's degree — whether
in science, engineering or the afts — counts
for far more than a passport to a round of
interviews. Our Training Scheme is planned
to empfoy all his university attainments to
the full, and to be adaptable to his individual
needs.
Just who are T & N ? Turner & Newall is one
of the strongest, most important groups in
British industry. With a large and growing
stake in asbestos-cement, in insulation, in
brake linings and in plastics T & N is closely
linked to all four major areas of economic
growth. To the building industry; the motor
industry; the newer plastics; and to activity in
the developing territories of the Common-
wealth . . . all adding up to a strongly expand-
ing £100,000,000 business with 39,000
employees. Overseas, with 17 companies in
10 countries, T & N has doubled its interests in
ten years.
Earlier Responsibility T 4 N thus offers
outstanding graduates a career of great scope,
keyed from the first to areas in which expan-
sion is at its fastest.. . opportunity at its best.
Moreover, under our broad and flexible
training scheme, the graduate assumes
managerial responsibility more confidently —
and certainly earlier — than is often the case in
industry today.
Note to Research Men T & N also recruits
scientists and engineers direct into its re-
search and development branches, whose
projects are particularly closely linked to the
needs of the expanding industries. Opport-
unities for supervising work with a practical
application, as well as for fundamental study,
are thus outstandingly good.

INTER-COLLEGE
I DEBATING
! Mines are entering a very im-
pressive team and should retain
the cup. Our first match on 9th
March against R.C.S. "That
night Caps are more satisfactory
than Knight Hoods," should lead
to some intelligent debating.
Support from the floor is wel-
comed, especially when it comes
to choosing the winners for they
are assessed on the cheers of the
crowd.
On 23rd of March Mines meets
Guilds to oppose the motion
" That Ireland owes more to
Guinness than St. Patrick." Our
President should have a good few
words to say on that subject.
