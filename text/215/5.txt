THE FILM
On Sunday, 21st February,
1965, Guilds started shooting
their film in Hyde Park. The
battle scenes were in the can,
when three park rangers arrived
on their government surplus
bicycles, to inform Mr. Bishop
that he constituted a crowd.
However, extraction from the im-
pending midden was forthcoming,
for pausing only to film these
three camera-shv censors, and to
bid farewell to the hundred spec-
tators and three dogs that had
paused on their Sunday walk, the
company adjourned to Prince's
Gardens. Here the chariot race
was filmed. The race was nar-
rowly won by the new " sports "
model of Mechanical 2, with its
intrepid driver Phil "Legs"
Marshall.
Chem. Eng. produced an old
cocoa tin, containing some ap-
parently innocuous powder.
Twenty-eight matches caused the
above to precipitate iito flame
and thencefore the Ia.:J, and all
that was there unto, was girded
about with dense black fumes, for
a time upwards of ten minutes.
The film that was shot on that
Sunday has now been developed,
and is of a high standard. The
final result will be about 20 mins.
in length, and will be shown at the
first Union Meeting in the Sum-
mer Term.
The story of the film is as fol-
lows: —
Mr. Molam, a goodly man, is
out riding in the mews with his
lady in their new car, " B o . "
Suddenly they are attacked by an
old blue van, from which leaps
the evil King, who steals the lady,
and drives off.
Mr. Molam gathers up his
" goodies " and gives chase in a
red van. The two adversaries
meet in a head on collision at the
Albert Hall, and converse in
" baloon talk." The only solu-
tion to the crisis is a battle, and
so to the park for a dramatic,
thrilling, heat palpitating punch-
up, involving dustbin cannon,
much smoke and flashes, and
three rangers on bicycles.
The battle is halted by a referee,
who suggests that a chariot race
is a more civilised (Mechanical)
solution. The crowd disappears,
and makes a ghoul-like reappear-
ance at the start of the race. The
evil King has meanwhile put Mr.
Molam through the " tortures of
Tantalus." The " goodies " win
the race, but again the evil King,
steals the lady, and drives off in
his Austin Martin DB6 van, only
to be headed off by Mr. Molam
on his bike. In the ensuing
tussel, Mr. Molam is thrown into
the Sepentine for his trouble.
Suddenly, a hand clasping a
Spanner appears through the;
turgid water. Mr. Molam grasps
the weapon andfinallydispatches
the evil King with a cruel blow
to the "pate." Thefilmends wth
Mr. Molam and his good lady
disappearing into the sunlight(?).
UNION MEETING
For all those who would pre-
fer some healthy fresh air and
sunshine to a dank and dark
laboratory, may we recommend
the " Field Cup," on Thursday
11th March. This will follow the
Union Meeting at 1.15 pan. to be
held in Room 542, Mech. Eng.
R.C&
In our last news-sheet Dave Christopher raised the question of
whether subsidising the Furzedown party was a reasonable way of
spending the money we appear to have over this year. We've tried
to make it clear that money is available from the union if people
want to do things or start clubs. Last Thursday Pete Jones came
to the Union office after money to subsidise a Physics staff social
evening. This is of wider appeal than our usual sport activities and
it may be supported by the Union. Considering the money we spent
chasing Theta, it seems it should be.
THE BAR
It is often said by the people to whom our entertainments and
sport activities don't appeal, that the Union is run from the bar.
They can't talk to Union officers unless they drink beer in vast quan-
tities. Of course, one gets to know people in the bar—after all the
Union is large and you don't get far with the dinners and receptions
we have. What else is there for it ? We could run the Union from
the snack bar, but it's shut in the evenings and chaos at lunch-time.
You don't have to be a boozer to pass an hour in the bar, orange
is the lunch-time drink of many. Of course, you could drop in the
Union office in Chemistry for coffee on Thursday lunch-times with
your moans and bright ideas.
R.CJS.U. DINNER
Next term it is planned to have a dinner for about 300 in South
Side as well as the final year dinner later. There are rather ambitious
ideas for guest speakers. We shall see.
At last I.C. students are tak-
ing an interest in their Carnival.
The turnout for the Kensington
collection on the 26th was superb
and the Carnival Committee
would like to thank all those
who came along. At the time of
writing we have not received
much in reply, but three days
after the appeal was started is
early to judge.
Floats and Stalls
Are you going to do a Caraiv.il
Float this year ?
. If vou are. start thinking about
it now, as we will want to know
what length the procession will be.
After the procession there is the
fete, so start thinking about this
as well!
Juke Box
During the Carnival Week
there will be a juke box in the
college—where exactly, we don't
know yet. Again there will be
coffee sales, and the Hot Dog
stand.
Raffle Tickets
In the very near future you'll be
receiving your raffle tickets—Two
books to undergraduates, one to
Postgraduates. Try and sell as
many as you possibly can. As
before, the raffle winners are
eligible to compete for the big
prize, this year a Hillman Imp.
Pink Panther and 007 ?
Rumour has it that for this
years film festival "The Pink
Panther" and "From Russia
with Love " will be shown. They
may be shown in the Concert Hall
and the Lower lounge simul-
taneously!
Helpers Wanted
At the moment things are going
reasonably well, but we are still
UNION MEETING
The next Union meeting will be
on 16th March. The old Theta
is still kicking around—maybe it
should be de-sanctified or some-
thing and put back in the Guilds
bog whence it came. Ashes to
ashes and ball-cocks unto ball-
cocks. Smith will doubtless re-
port on ents. committee deeds and
misdeeds. We're about due for a
Council report too methinks. I'm
keeping away from that trap-door
after mixing up Scrutiny editor
with Phoenix editor in the news-
sheet.
SPORTS DAY
On the last Sunday of term,
21st March, we'll be having our
winter sports day at Harlington.
The usual idea is if you normally
play a game, play something dif-
ferent this time. This gives two-
lefted-footed clowns with ten
thumbs like me a chance to join in
and enjoy ourselves. There'll be
soccer, mixed hockey and rugger,
maybe mixed with women in the
scrum and only women scoring
tries. It is hoped to have taped
music and a few indoor games
atterwards. Sign up on the lists.
C. S. EVANS
suffering from a Chronic lack of
helpers—there are only about a
dozen pople who have to spend
every minute of their spare time
working for the Carnival — a
ridiculous situation in a college of
1500 undergrads alone!
Please can you help in some
way—even if only selling Carnival
Lunch tickets or drawing posters.
Much has to be done, and every
bit of help is welcome. Come to
the Carnival office any lunchtime
—we'll find something for you to
do!
J.H.A.
Record in
the can —
out April
This year's I.C. Carnival record
is IHW " in the can " and will be
on sale from the beginning of
next term.
The emphasis has been placed
this year on the quality of tech-
nical presentation. This has
been made possible by the loan
of much professional equipment
by an Old Centralian who runs
a recording studio in London.
At one recent recording session
the value of equipment used was
conservatively estimated to be
about £1250. The session lasted
ten hours, at the end of which one
three-minute track, specially
written for the record, was per-
fected and on tape (indicating an
efficiency of about 0.5%?).
Other tracks include the Col-
lege war-cries, all recorded live at
recent Union meetings, and a live
Hootenanny recording. The whole
is linked by an American tra-
velogue-type commentary (a la
Sellers ?).
Twelve minutes of IC sounds
and songs, very good value for
only 7s. 6d., and on sale from the
enr of April.
