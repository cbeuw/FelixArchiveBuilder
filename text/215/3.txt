A NIGHT A T T H E OPERETTA
Memorable lolanthe
The Tmpe-ial College Operatic Society's production of Gilbert
and Sullivan's " Iolanthe," put on throughout the last week of
February, seems to have been a success. Although at the start the
audiences were not large, the last two nights saw full houses.
And yet there was nothing outstanding, nothing new. Now that
the copyright has expired, one would have expected some attempt at
originality in the production, but none was made. Therefore it can-
not be said that this was a memorable performance even though
there was no lack of vigour.
At last here was an orchestra that could get through the over-
ture without sounding like a warped record. This improvement was
undoubtedly due to it being mainly made up from our neighbours at
RCM. It is a pity that IC cannot produce a competent orchestra on
its own,
The first half of this Savoy Opera is definitely the most difficult
to perform as it contains no catchy songs or hilarious situations.
Some good acting or some startling innovation could have created
interest here. But none were forthcoming, and the first half dragged.
The entry of the fairies, singing "We are dainty little fairies,"
evoked some laughter since they
could hardly have looked much
out of place in a rugby scrum.
The fairy queen, Diana Cromp-
ton, made a very regal figure and
looked well able to cope with her
enormous brood.
The appearance and transfor-
mation of Iolanthe was dramatic,
in Ann Hay, IC has obviously
someone of great talent. Unfor-
tunately, most of the women's
voices were drowned by the loud-
ness of the orchestra, but this was
unavoidable without an orchestra
pit. Only Susan Browne, as
Phyllis, succeeded in defeating
the orchestra.
FELIX AIRBORNE
Who are they ? Why does
Harlington interest them? And
what is Felix doing in a toy
plane ?
" They " are members of the
newly formed I.C. Model Aircraft
Club, which meets regularly at
that model-making mecca, Har-
lington, to prove that some
British Aircraft really fly!

A Japanese
Western
On Friday, 12th March, I.C.
Film Soc. presents " The Hidden
Fortress." Directed by Ahira
Kurosawa, this Japanese Western
is set in the period of the civil
wars between Samurai and war-
lords. It tells how a princess,
a warrior and two comic peasants
make their way through enemy
territory to safe lands.
Supporting will be "Nuit Et
Brouillard," Alain Resnais' fam-
ous documentary about Ausch-
witz.
Our last film of the term will
be the Orson Welles epic, " Citi-
zen Kane." This will be shown
on Friday 9th March, and will be
followed by the A.G.M.
FLAT STREPHQN
Of the males, Dennis Yell, as
Strephon, was inclined to be flat
both in singing and acting. The
c.itry of the peers was a more
sober affair than that of the
fairies, and their chorus singing
was excellent. The two earls,
Richard Ault and Tony Smyth,
performed well throughout where-
as the Lord Chancellor, Harry
Epton, didn't really come into his
own until the second half.
Aftc refreshment time, the
second part started with a bang,
even though Private Willis' (Chris
Hocking) musket was not loaded.
His soliloquy was deservedly en-
cored. From then on, the audi-
ence was applauding every num-
ber, and the cast could do no
wrong.
The Lord Chancellor and the
two earls made some amusing
antics which were well received,
and everybody looked as is they
were enjoying themselves. The
final chorus, with the. whole cast
on stage, was impressive, and for
once the orchestra was nearly
completely drowned. Some of the
peers must be congratulated on
being actually able to lift some of
the fairies for the finale.
Even if this was not a memor-
able production of " Iolanthe,"
at least it was an enjoyable one.
It is the end that we remember
longest, and.the end was good. So
perhaps next year there will be
full houses every night of the week
instead of just the final two nights.
