Hockey,
CUP FINAL Cant, from p. 1
A good run by Stenning and Hough ended with Stenning
sprawling on the ground. The halves were distributing the ball well,
in particular sending passes down the right wing for Goddard to
collect at incredible speed.
Following a movement which started inside the I.C. half, West
Ham again gave away a short corner. . Castell passed the ball to
Phillips who scored with the assistance of the back of a West Ham
stick. President Price led the ensuing Hey Vivo.
I.C. continued to press but
West Ham were still dangerous;
and following a movement down I
the left wing they had the ball
in the net—however the umpire
ruled it had gone out of play
earlier.
In the closing minutes West
Ham pressed the I.C. defence
hard but with good covering and
two fine saves by Needham they
held out to the final whistle.
Result: I.C. 1—0 West Ham.
This was a very good match,
fast and furious with a lot of good
Hockey. West Ham had three
players who were individually
superior to any I.C. man. But
I.C. played far more as a team to
the limit of their abilities and as
Athletics
An Appeal on
Behalf Of....
By D. R. Wade
March is the month when all
true track athletes should break
their dormancy spent in the gym-
nasium and expose themselves to
the rigours of outdoor training.
But where are the'athletes of I.C?
Has this age of affluence com-
pletely diluted the spirit of man
to compete against fellow-man?
For many years I.C. has had a
good reputation in intercollegiate
athletics; but recently there has
been a" decline in enthusiasm
amongst I.C. students, and the
honour of the club has rested on
the shoulders of a few active
members. Athletics is one of the
few sports which provides an op-
portunity for every type of indi-
vidual to participate, surely there
must be within I.C. several poten-
tial athletes capable of filling some
of the vacant places in the I.C.
team. If anyone is interested in
the club and its training activities,
please contact D. R. W A D E as
soon as possible.
The first track meets will be
friendly get-togethers on the 17th
and 24th of March. During the
Easter vac. several members will
be attending a 4 day training
course, this is not only an excel-
lent method of getting fit but also
a great deal of fun and and oppor-
tunity to mix with some of
Britain's top athletes and coaches.
such they succeeded where West
Ham's individuality failed. If
one man was beaten there was
always someone backing up. The
defence was as steady as a rock,
Peters doing a great deal of work
without making a serious mistake.
All congratulations must go to
E. Castell, the Captain, and the
whole team for this fine finish to
a highly successful season.

To Shake up Club
By our Swimming Reporter
I.C. 0-3 U.C.
I.C., were outclassed by a U.C.
team that was clearly superior in
nearly every department of the
game. Only a fine display by
Gocdkeper Banyard saved this
match from being a landslide
victory for U.C. Before the
match I.C. were victims of an
annoying setback when a player
failed to arrive without him giv-
ing any prior warning. It was not
the first time that this player has
let the side down in this fashion.
It's bad luck continued for Davis
had to retire injured after Goldie
scored U.C.'s first goal in the
opening quarter. Second-team
captain Furness made a worth-
while substitute however. Most of
the game was played in the I.C.
half and any breaks that I.C.
started only ended in a muddle.
I.C. were certainly lucky not to
lose this match by double the
score.
It is apparent that the perform-
ance of the I.C. Ist team has been
dwindling lately and the overall
record of the 2nd team does not
do justice to its promising talent.
Mike Stenning pushes the ball through to the right wing.

Despite a disappointing draw
against Hampstead II, I.C's.
London league side still has a
good chance of promotion, par-
ticularly as the team has been
strengthened by the arrival of
Stepan Bruzzu, a national master
from Italy.
The 3rd and 4th team players
still show commendable keeness
and have at last been rewarded
with some matches.
Results:
Pugh Cup—I.C. 2\, U.C. 3^.
London League—I.C. 5 Hamp-
stead II 5.
This sorry state of affairs is surely
a product of the complacent feel-
ing, that has crept into the Club
this term. Swimming fixtures
have virtually become a thing of
the past and a purposeless Friday
night " throw-around " with the
ball seems to have taken its place.
JUST FOR FUN
One gentleman thought that the
2nd team for which he played
entered Division 11 of the league
just for "fun." Thanks to the
efforts of Furness the 2nd team
have recently found that winning
polo matches can be even more
enjoyable than what, in the past,
has looked like taking a gentle
bathe with a beach-ball.
With the results of Div. I now
in the balance it seems a great
pitjrihat the golden opportunity
provided by our many talented
players has beenJhrown away by
this complacent attitude.

Rifle Club,
For the first time since it was
presented to Imperial College in
1928 (by a Minesman), RSM has
finally succeeded in winning the
Courtman Shield.
This year R S M had a strong
team and it was clear from the
beginning that the Guilds-RCS
supremacy in this sport would be
challenged. In fact, all three
teams shot well and the final
scores were better than anticipa-
ted. In the end the Shield was
won by a very narrow margin
from Guilds by RSM.
Final total scores (ex. 1200)
RSM 1,163, Guilds 1,158, RCS
1,135.
Best individual scores (ex. 200)
