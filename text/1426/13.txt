Videopia killed the radio star!
Cocktails, dancing and comically bad acting. Catherine Jones reviews a creative night of film-making fun
V
ideopia is an interactive
club night at The Not-
ting Hill Arts Club that is
just “too cool for school”.
With a frivolous mix of
low budget movie making, up-and-
coming bands and dancefloor antics, it
has something to appeal to film buffs
and indie kids alike.
The set up is simple. On a shoestring
budget, they mixed, shot and screened
“The best bits” of Speilberg Classic E.T.
in the corner of the Notting Hill club.
With homemade props and costumes,
the D.I.Y. ethnic ruled. No money was
wasted on C.G.I. E.T.’s costume was
cobbled together from papier mâché
and brown sellotape, and looked pretty
realistic. Clubbers became actors, as
the busy bar was hushed as filming be-
gan with the cry of “Action!”.
Filming for a good hour or so, the
evening reached a climax with the E.T.
film premiere. The E.T. production was
comedically bad in (most) places, but
never short of charm. As you would
expect filming a single take, the acting
quality wasn’t great (maybe they drank
too much Long Island E.T.?). It was dif-
ficult to follow in places, despite efforts
to create character continuity with
costume. On a positive note, IC radio
stars Seth (Capital Science), Thom and
Sam (Papercuts) made some of the best
contributions of the night. You can see
for yourself on the Videopia facebook
group.
The live music began with Bristol’s
Let’s Tea Party, a quirky indie-pop
act. The endearing trio put in a well
received performance, notable for the
driving, funky bass rhythms that got
the crowd moving.
Let’s Tea Party’s played with their
characteristic deadpan delivery of sur-
real lyrics, using an eclectic choice of
instruments. So eclectic, I think I may
have heard a kazoo played at one point.
The eclecticism is not always received
in a straightforward way. During a flute
solo, a friend exclaimed “I just can’t get
the mental picture of Ron Burgandy
(From “Anchorman”) out of my head”.
Let’s Tea Party have been heavily
tipped for the big time world of indie-
pop stardom this year, by the likes of
NME, XFM and BBC Introducing.
Based on that performance I would say
they were a funny, charming, pop ver-
sion of The Young Knives, and worth
making the effort to see again.
Next up, Favours for Sailors, an alt
rock foursome. Although an enjoyable
band to watch, I felt guitar acts were
at a disadvantage. In comparison to
the imaginative electro acts on rest of
the bill, they sounded flat and generic .
Favours for Sailors were at times Remi-
niscent of Razorlight, The Cribs and
King’s of Leon. Perhaps in a different
context, their guitar rock could shine.
Finally on the bill, the impressive
Portasound. Whistling solos, nob
twiddling solos, dancable electro pop-
made with analogue and digital instru-
ments. My highlight was the infectious,
uplifting single “The Wrong Parade”. I
want to dance just talking about it. I
thought the keyboard solo was just so
“squiggly” for want of a better term. As
a frame of reference, I consider I think
they are a more electro Late of the Pier.
In fact they recently remixed Late of
the Pier’s “Broken”. On tour they have
supported Metronomy, Friendly Fires,
Shitdisco, and they firmly fit in that
genre of band.
Finally the Rockfeedback DJs kept
the dancefloor going until the early
hours with a surprising mix of the
revered classics (Rock the Kazbah,
Beastie Boys, Yeah Yeah Yeahs) mixed
with the new.
The frivolity continued as E.T, yes
E.T, made an appearance on the dance-
floor. And he has “the moves” ! Using
his unusually flat head, he executed
some break dancing moves which
were out of this world! At 3 am after a
hard slog on the dancefloor, with some
strange characters, we all went home,
E.T. included.
Videopia returns on March 10th with
remakes of “Willy Wonka” and on May
12th with “Ghost Busters”. Stars of stage, screen... and the Notting Hill Arts Club
