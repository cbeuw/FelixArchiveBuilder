Bottle
Royal School of Mines beat Cambourne
School of Mines in the 109th Bottle Match
The deciding and definitive part of the
Bottle Match is always the rugby and
has always been a notorious match
known for its physicality, competitive-
ness and banter given by the crowd…
which sadly leaves most people shell-
shocked and vowing either never to
come to another RSM event again or
never to drop a touch of alcohol again.
This year was no exception with broken
bones, streakers, drunkenness and vic-
tory once again to the Royal Miners!
Pressure had been mounting on
the rugby team all day with the other
teams being on the wrong end of all
other matches. This match was the
only thing stopping the mutant inbred
Camborne miners from obtaining the
coveted whitewash. By the time both
teams had arrived on the pitch the
crowds had amassed on both sidelines,
the banter was overflowing from the
megaphones and the sun was shining
onto an almost glistening pitch. It was
the perfect start for the perfect match.

Varsity 2009 a success for Imperial
W
ith the sporting
season nearly over
Varsity 2009 has
proven a suitable fi-
nale. With the final
overall score swinging in the favour of
Imperial, it was once again the medical
students who took the glory at Rich-
mond in the evening. Lifting that JPR
Williams cup has been a long time in
waiting for Imperial College, and once
again the IC supporters were left dis-
appointed if not fairly entertained.
The full time score was all level as it
was last year, but extra time was too
much for Imperial and the experienced
Medical side capitalised on the oppor-
tunity to make up for their earlier 7-0
deficit. It is a shame that this year both
teams have struggled in their Premier-
ship campaigns, and the draw at full
time will stand for their BUCS result
leaving them both footing the bottom
of the table.
At Harlington, football and hockey
was dominated by the Imperial stu-
dents while Rugby 2nd and 3rd XV
were both victories for ICSM. The IC
netballers did not do well at Ethos, but
their newly formed 4th team did man-
age to get a win.
Other sports including squash, bas-
ketball, lacrosse and waterpolo were
dominated by Imperial College which
sealed the overall 6 point win over the
Imperial Medics.
It was definitely a successful day with
the ICSM chicken prancing and the
IC streaker streaking! Blood was shed,
tears were seen and the passion to
beat our opposite numbers was more
prominent than ever.
You will have to wait for a full round
up however... The Rival mgazine is be-
ing written as we speak with hundreds
of photos to sort and matches to ana-
lyse there is lots to do! If you would like
to help out in any way, get in touch.
If not then get excited about your
own souvenir from the showcase
sports day that is Varsity and bring on
Varsity 2010!
