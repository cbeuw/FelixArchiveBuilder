In case you missed Oscar night!
Y
es that’s right! Oscar sea-
son has come and gone,
and I am pretty sure eve-
ryone knows who the big
winners and sore losers
were at the Academy Awards ceremo-
ny this year, held in the Kodak Theatre
in Los Angeles. Just in case you didn’t,
I have provided a list of the winners
of the Big Six gongs of the night – the
awards that everyone waits nervously
(and sometimes impatiently) for.
You might be surprised and shocked
to hear that this movie maniac actu-
ally stayed up way past his bedtime in
order to watch the Oscars live, as they
unfolded halfway across the globe.
Why you might ask? Well yes, it is a lit-
tle bit sad, but every respectable film
critic has to do it at least once in their
life! But because I was sucked into it,
I felt like I was experiencing the diz-
zying heights and embarrassing lows
of the evening along with the crème
de la crème of A-list celebrities and
Hugh Jackman shows off his excellent Broadway entertainment skills
It’s funny, really. I haven’t grown to ap-
preciate Clint Eastwood’s recent films
of “great emotional power” (Mystic
River) or those where “new emotional
heights” were reached (Million Dollar
Baby). Both were by-the-book dramas,
despite being well executed and left me
so empty that I simply could not under-
stand what all the fuss was about – and
if you’ve read any of my other articles,
you know I don’t shy away from sad
tales of redemption. But sometimes
even good films fall flat because they’re
too focused on the dramatic spectacle
that’s unfolding and not so much on
the drama itself. Surely, it’s a matter of
personal taste and interpretation, be-
cause otherwise I’d have to stop believ-
ing in my sense of value.
Gran Torino is an effort that feels
much more down to earth. It does not
take itself too seriously and yet man-
ages to strike a good balance between
what works and what doesn’t. Sure,
the central character, Walt Kowalski,
is shaped from the same mould as
“Dirty” Harry Callahan with a pinch of
self-irony, and the story is not particu-
larly imaginative, but Eastwood uses
both to create a romantically nostalgic
character that keeps the film together.
Walt is a sour old war veteran, the
typical image of the strict and ultra-
conservative tough guy and the movie
begins with his wife’s funeral. Nowa-
days, the old man is finding it difficult
to come to terms with the idea that his
neighbourhood has become ethnically
The most eagerly awaited night of the year for anyone in the movie industry may have been and gone, but
Jonathan Dakin denied himself sleep to bring us the night’s recap.
high powered movers and shakers of
one of the world’s most powerful and
successful industries. I jumped on the
Oscar train and was dragged along
for the ride, so I thought it would be
relevant that I write an article chroni-
cling the whole event.
For me and for the rest of the coun-
try, the Oscars began at 11pm, and I
switched over to Sky 1 to see Fearne
Cotton standing on the red carpet,
trying her hardest to grab and in-
terview celebrities as they arrived at
biggest night of the year for movies.
She was fairly unsuccessful, mainly
because she was not pushy enough es-
pecially as she was standing next to E!
Entertainment’s Ryan Seacrest (who
presents American Idol), so he was
getting all the big name stars before
her, and once they had been inter-
viewed by him they left the area and
moved to another. Poor Fearne. She
tried her hardest and did do a good
job, but spent most of the time talk-
ing about the glamorous dresses the
stars were wearing, and occasionally
sspeaking to Seacrest himself, when
he was taking a rest for a commercial
break.
At 1am, we were promised the Os-
Finally, at 1.30am, presenter Hugh
Jackman, recently voted ‘Sexiest
Man in the World’, began by singing
a moderately funny song that insult-
ed all of the films nominated. Anne
Hathaway was pulled out of the au-
dience and joined him, singing and
dancing together under the dazzling
Proscenium Arch of the stage. Every-
one smiled and laughed. Then a new
layout was introduced: five previous
winners came out together and talked
about each of the five nominees and
their roles for the category. I really
liked this approach – it felt fresh and
exciting and was far more dynamic
then just watching clips from the
films.
First up was Best Supporting Ac-
tress, and out came the five previous
winners – one of them was comedy
icon and my favourite actress of all
time, Whoopi Goldberg. She was on
top form as usual, making hilarious
jokes and stealing the moment from
the other four women. And the win-
ner of Best Supporting Actress was…
Penelope Cruz – I was very happy
about this, as I felt it was about time
that she was recognised for her acting
talent!
After this, time began to blur into
a hazy fog as tiredness began to set
in. Man On Wire won for Best Docu-
mentary – and the trapeze artist the
film is about was so happy about it
he balanced the Oscar on his chin.
Then Seth Rogan (from Knocked
Up) and James Franco (from Spi-
derman) tried their hardest at being
funny and failed miserably. They also
came across as spectacularly rude by
mispronouncing a German winner’s
name and then laughing about it – I
guess it shows how knowledgeable
they are about other cultures. I’m
sure it wouldn’t have been hard to
ask someone beforehand how to pro-
nounce the names…
The lowest point of the evening
came when a painfully wooden Dan-
iel Craig and a clearly uncomfortable
Sarah-Jessica Parker attempted to
read an autocue whilst pretending to
have some sort of chemistry. As much
as I like the new Bond, he doesn’t re-
ally seem to have any personality at
all and was just terrible at feigning
an interest in talking about the nomi-
nees. Oh dear.
But on the plus side, this horrible
event was followed by the most thrill-
ing and amazing highlight of the
evening – a show-stopping perform-
ance by R&B beauty Beyonce. Along
with Jackman and some of the stars of
High School Musical and Mam-
ma Mia, she sang a compilation
of songs from famous musi-
cals. Of course she stole the
show and out sang everyone,
as the kids from High School
and Mamma Mia were com-
pletely washed out, but what
did honestly you expect?
Jackman managed
to hold his own
zat least as he
sung with her,
impressing eve-
ryone including
myself. Once
Beyonce had
finished I
leapt off of
my sofa for a
standing ovation. Maybe
I was getting too carried
away…
Steve Martin did some
presenting and was very
funny, as was Cuba Good-
ing Jr. Heath Ledger was
predictably announced
Best Supporting Actor and
there was not a dry eye in
the house. Crocodile tears
flooded the theatre (par-
ticularly from actor Adrian
Brody) and it seemed like
everyone was deeply moved
(or were they – they are after
all, actors). Call me cynical,
but was Heath really the best
supporting actor of the year
or did he just win because he
died? I am not doubting the
fact that he gave a very good
performance- I just question
whether it was Oscar-worthy?!
But regardless of what this
cynic thinks – congratula-
tions to him!
After several more pain-
ful auto-cued presenta-
tions, a ray of sunlight in
the form of Will Smith
popped out and showed everyone
how to do it, mainly because he actu-
ally seemed happy to be there!
It was 3.55am now, and no other big
awards had been announced. I was
less than impressed, especially be-
cause the people winning the awards
for things like Best Make-up did not
seem particularly happy to win.
Of course it is good to stay
composed – but at least crack
a smile!
Finally John Legend broke
up some of the tedium by
singing, although he was ac-
companied by some horrible,
screeching, Bangra mu-
sic. I am not a fan of
Bangra music; al-
though the man
who composed
this song went
on to win an
Oscar for
it. As I un-
plugged my
fingers from
my ears, I
seriously ques-
tioned this decision.
At 4.10am a Japanese
man won an award and
every Japanese person
in the audience followed
him on stage. I was be-
ginning to feel restless
and tired. Why had none
of the good awards been
given out yet? Why was
Kate not holding an Oscar?
Why was I still compelled
to watch? Why?? Then the
awards got even more de-
pressing when the great
Queen Latifah sang a song
about everyone who had
died in the past year. Not
the kind of thing you want
to watch at 4.15am in the
morning when you are ex-
tremely tired and irritable.
Finally at 4.20am, they
announced Best Director.
And I was shocked. I never
thought they would give
it to an Englishman –
but good on him!
Then at 4.30am all
of my waiting finally
paid off when they announced what
I had been waiting to hear all night:
KATE WINSLET WINS!! I am not
going to lie: just before the announce-
ment I was clutching the sofa in nerv-
ous anticipation. I thought Meryl
might add another trophy to her cabi-
net, but Kate deservedly won. Well
done Kate! I had my English flag out a
waved it jubilantly as I jumped up and
down, screaming in delight!
4.40am (you can tell I was really get-
ting impatient now as I was intensely
watching the clock): Sean Penn wins
Best Actor – another shocking win.
Poor Mickey Rourke! I couldn’t help
but feel really sorry for him as he was,
after all, tipped to win it! Instead,
Penn smugly took to the stage.
4.50am: Slumdog Millionaire wins
Best Picture, and half of India goes to
the podium along with the cast and
crew. People smile at the little kids
who were shipped over from Mumbai
to show that they weren’t paid pea-
nuts for acting in the film. Everyone
is happy. Everyone has realised finally
that the English film industry can
make good films! Hurrah!
Hugh Jackman walks out and says
“Thank you”, credits roll: the end.
The End?? Yes, the end. It was very
abrupt! I felt like I wanted more time
to see the winners but I was happy it
was finally over – I needed SLEEP!
As I dragged myself off of my sofa
to bed at 5am, I was left with a few
thoughts to ponder over about the
movie industry;
1) It is very political. When the
writer of Milk won Best Screenplay,
he took his opportunity to promote
gay rights – as did Sean Penn. I have a
feeling this has something to do with
the recent repeal of gay marriage in
California…
2) Did Slumdog Millionaire really
deserve eight awards? Did it really??
I am proud that an English film and
English director has been very suc-
cessful, as well as the fact that Ameri-
cans didn’t just vote for an American
film – but was it really the best film of
the year? See my next point for more
elaboration…
3) Why wasn’t Dark Knight nomi-
nated for Best Picture or Best Direc-
tor? It was both critically and com-
mercially successful, making over $1
billion worldwide. Surely that was the
best film of the year???
4) Watching the show in its en-
tirety makes you see that the whole
Academy Awards is an old boys’ club.
They all know each other, they are all
friends. It was almost as if they were
indoctrinating the cast and crew of
Slumdog Millionaire into their gang
as they won. No wonder it is hard to
get into showbiz! I’m sure the cama-
raderie is good once you are in – but
how can you break into such a hard-
ened clique in the first place?
So in conclusion: Well done to Eng-
land: winning Best Film, Best Docu-
mentary, Best Director and Best Ac-
tress is pretty impressive. Finally we
are getting recognised for our talent!
My final thoughts are to give you
some advice. Next year when the
Academy Awards are on: go to sleep,
wake up in the morning and read the
list of Oscar winners. There is no
point staying up and watching the
ceremony. It was way too long and, at
times, boring, tedious and embarrass-
ing. Yes there were some incredible
highlights like Beyonce shaking her
stuff and Whoopi Goldberg making a
brief appearance but if you feel com-
pelled to, watch the highlights on You
Tube: it is easier and quicker. That
said, I can’t help but feel a sense of
pride in myself for managing to watch
it all… I did get really engrossed in it,
but mainly because I was anxiously
waiting for over 2 and a half hours for
them to announce whether Kate had
won or not!! If it is this bad for a ran-
dom member of the public, can you
imagine waiting that long if you were
nominated??
Will I stay up to watch the Oscars
next year? Only if I am invited to the
ceremony itself. And who knows: it
could happen! And the winner is…
me! Wow, I guess staying up that late
really does make you delusional!
Sixth time was the charm for Kate
Danny Boyle deserves an Oscar just for being such a great person
A.R. Rahman went home with
two golden guys. Some night, eh?
Unsurprisingly Ledger won Best Supporting Actor posthumously. Just
a pity the Dark Knight was largely ignored on the night.
Penn used his on-air time to
advocate gay rights
cars would begin, so I switched to Sky
Movies Premiere and was greeted by
Claudia Winkleman and other fairly
well-known guests (one of them was
the hilarious Danny Wallace). They
chatted for a good half an hour and I
was less then impressed. I kept check-
ing the clock. Why had the Oscars not
begun? Why were they dragging this
out for as long as possible? Why was
I not in bed instead?? I just wanted to
see Kate Winslet finally win for Best
Actress!!
diverse and any concept of socialisa-
tion seems foreign to him. Moreover,
he has a very strained relationship with
his sons, which basically means that
he spends his days pretty much alone.
Everything changes, however, once
Walt defends the son of his neighbours
from a street gang and a process of “re-
humanisation” seems to occur.
The reason why Eastwood’s character
is so likable, despite his diminished so-
cial skills, is that he is an embodiment
of all the things we so dearly yearn to
see in recluse heroes: he seems obnox-
ious but actually isn’t, he catches on
fast, he always knows what the right
thing to do is and he is able to come
out on top – in a manner of speak-
ing. There’s something special about
being blunt and always being correct
about things – because that’s the only
circumstances which excuse such anti-
social behaviour.
What ruins part of the experience in
Gran Torino is the generally mediocre
acting around Eastwood and particu-
larly that of Bee Vang , who portrays
Thao, the boy being bullied. Several rel-
evant scenes get torn to shreds by the
unconvincing performance Vang deliv-
ers but luckily one can bear these with
a little courage and determination.
In the end, Gran Torino looks like a
fairy-tale of a story: a nice, old fash-
ioned feel-good movie, filled with
healthy laughs and divine justice. How-
ever it is fairly simplistic and it lacks
the depth of other Eastwood movies,
which means that unless you grow to
like Walt Kowalski, this viewing ex-
perience will turn out to be less than
rewarding.
It seems like Eastwood can’t leave drama alone

In his latest feature – Gran Torino – the famous cowboy boldly takes on the issue of racism.
Clint Eastwood without a gun – now that would be a sight, but this is nothing we haven’t seen before.
This week we have three DVD cop-
ies of Asylum to give away.
Asylum is a terrifying tale of a
group of undergraduate university
students discovering that their dor-
mitory was formerly an experimen-
tal mental health institution, which
soon reawakens their own buried
personal traumas.
This disturbing horror film will
be just the thing to watch from be-
hind the sofa while ignoring Trick
or Treaters on Halloween night.
If you would like to win Asylum
just in time for Halloween, then all
you have to do is answer the follow-
ing question:
What is the name of the se-
rial killer in the Halloween
movies?
