Oh RSM, is wonderful...
From the off it was apparent that
Camborne were going to be extremely
dominant in the pack, with a no8 who
was definitely over 35 and balding (due
to his age, not because he was fucking
his mum as someone yelled over the
megaphone). Whilst their team had
regularly played against other mal-
formed Cornish teams who had taken
too many steroids in their spare time
at school. As a result Camborne were
causing havoc in the scrums and were
generally being disruptive enough to
stop the RSM back line from making
any real gains, however this did not
stop the Adam Foley and Alex John-
stone from capitalising from any of
their mistakes but they were sadly not
able to convert any of these attempts
into points. As the game went on the
Royal Miners decided that it would be
extremely unfair to hold onto the ball
all the time and saw fit to give away
multiple penalties to Camborne, which
resulted in them going deep in to
RSM’s territory and finally culminated
in an unimaginative converted penalty
taking the Mohawk wearing (seriously,
Mohawks were never in fashion. Why
bring them back for a match that you
are unlikely to win?) Camborne miners
into the lead 3-0.
Even after CSM took the first points
of the match the Royal Miners were
still in neutral mode, not really play-
ing their game plan and just putting
in some brutal tackles to make sure
no more points were scored. With the
game still being played in the middle of
the pitch and with no side really tak-
ing control, Tim Chalke decided to
have a spirited run at their winger to
show how much of a man he was. He
subsequently proved his manliness by
having his cheekbone fracture in mul-
tiple places as he was brought down
but this did not stop him from making
it to the union later in the evening! Half
time arrived quickly after a dirty CSM
player was yellow carded for danger-
ous play. Stern words were had during
the team talk about playing to our po-
tential. Bobby Goulding was particu-
larly irate at the lack of action he had
in the match and was clearly baying for
the blood of a Camborne miner. First
blood against CSM was to be drawn
pretty soon…
It was almost as if a new invigorated
RSM team stepped foot on the pitch
in the second half, with every player
wanting victory and wanting to score
during the initial 8 minutes when CSM
had 14 players due to their scrum half
being sin binned at the end of the 1st
half. The forwards were finally secur-
ing ball and recycling it, providing a
platform for the backs to work from,
which Lluis Guasch and Adam Fo-
ley well and truly used with some well
timed switches and interplay causing
the Camborne backline to breakdown
and exposing a huge overlap on the
blindside. At an instant the entire team
had realised this and the ball was rap-
idly passed through the hands to Max
Joachim who smashed over the line in
the corner for the first try of the match
to the delight of the RSM crowd and
was then majestically converted by
Alex Johnstone.
RSM continued their domination
over Camborne by staying well and
firmly camped in their half and it wasn’t
long until the backs broke through the
Continued from back page
CSM defence again with Adam Foley
finding a sweet and sexy gap that he
thought he should slip into. This once
again started another round of mega-
phone chants from the Royal Miner’s
crowd and a brief pitch invasion.
Time was running out for Cambo-
rne; their lack of physical fitness was
really starting to show and they were
looking exhausted, unimaginative and
clearly dejected after watching some
professional champagne rugby from
RSM. Their players started going down
like flies, all with cries of the RSM team
were being overly aggressive (clearly
they had never played in a Bottle Match
before). However to their credit after
a complete lapse in the Royal Miner’s
defence, Camborne capitalised on a 5
person blindside overlap by making a
rapid break and scored a dubious try
in the corner even though the majority
of supporters saw the winger drop the
ball as he went over the try line.
After this brief example of skill, it
seemed that CSM had nothing left to
show and were back in their half fend-
ing off the continuous RSM onslaught,
which was sadly ended by the referees
whistle to finish the game. Upon the fi-
nal whistle the Royal School of Mines
crowd burst into pure pandemonium,
invading the pitch and celebrating with
every player that had put their body on
the line to defend the glorious bottle
for another year!

Football men’s
firsts gain revenge
over Roehampton
in BUCS
The previous fixture in BUCS 3A be-
tween these two resulted in a 3-1 win
for Roehampton and with the sides
placed lowly in the league, a win was
imperative for both.
The game took on a similar charac-
teristic to the previous encounter, with
both sides testing each other on the
break, but Imperial started the bright-
er of the two and the reward came after
the fifteen minute mark as they took
control of a set piece. Cameron Smith
delivered the ball and captain Michael
Donovan headed home convincingly
to put the home side up.
Roehampton responded immediate-
ly with glimpses of good football, but it
was evident they weren’t in full stride
as Imperial punished slack defend-
ing down the left channel. Will Swain
Michael Donovan
touched the ball past the Roehampton
full back, reached the by-line and cut
back for Dion Benincasa to slot home
calmly from 6 yards. The half finished
with Imperial 2-0 up, but Roes in the
ascendency. The best chance com-
ing from a free kick, that emphatically
struck the cross bar only for the Impe-
rial keeper to snatch the rebound.
The second half continued in a simi-
lar vein to the first, with Roes pressing,
but Imperial comfortable in defence.
However, calamitous defending on
a massive scale was to blame as Roes
were gifted a route back into the game
with half an hour left.
Imperial failed to clear on numerous
occasions and the centre midfielder
took his chance to drive the ball home
from the edge of the box. 2-1 became
3-1 with a strike, from Imperial mid-
fielder Cameron Smith, which the
keeper will be disappointed with.
Drama arrived late on with an error
from the Imperial keeper that gifted a
goal to Roehampton but the game pe-
tered out leaving Imperial looking up,
and Roes rooted to the bottom of the
league.

ICSM women dominate UH Head
A few weeks ago ICSM Boat Club add-
ed three gold medals to their collection
at the UH Winter Sprints in January,
and then, on the beautiful afternoon of
Saturday 21st February, once again the
club did not fail to impress as the ladies
won every women’s division, bringing
home a total of three victories.
Following a bitter sweet result at the
UH Sprints, where the women’s 1st
VIII sprinted their way into the final
but sadly narrowly lost to RUMS BC,
the women turned up to the UL Boat-
house in Chiswick with the single aim
of regaining headship. The race was a
gruelling experience our cox screaming
motivational words of encouragement,
reminding us to breathe in a futile at-
tempt to ease the pain as we sprinted
our way from Richmond to the finish
at the UL Boathouse. Despite pulling
away from GKT, nearly overtaking St.
George’s and knowing that none of us
could have given any more, how we did
in relation to RUMS was far too close
to call.
The women’s 2nd VIII, having won
medals at the UH Winter Sprints, were
also down with a point to prove, though
they too knew it would not be without
a fight. Injuries, academic commit-
ments and countless last minute prob-
lems plagued the 2nd VIII, meaning
that once again they had to rely on a
novice rower to complete their crew,
which was put together at the last
minute. The race was a challenge for
all, but nine smiling, albeit tired, faces
told us that whatever the final result, it
was a good race.
Perhaps the biggest pressure, how-
ever, was felt by the Novice Girls, who
had yet to experience how it feels to
lose a race. Having only started rowing
in October, and already two UH med-
als under their belts after their amazing
performance at the Novice Sprints in
November and the UH Winter Sprints,
this race would be unlike any other
they’d ever done. After weeks of train-
ing and a level of commitment to rival
the seniors’, the race plan discussed at
the carbo-loading session the night be-
fore, over limitless bowls of pasta, was
put into practice. Having overtaken the
crew they started behind within the
first two minutes, they raced their way
to UL, spurred on by the thought of
more “shiny, shiny medals”, and came
off the water looking exhausted but
satisfied.
The men’s division followed later in
the afternoon, where all crews were
faced with stiff competition from the
high number of entries, and invita-
tional crews in all categories including
UCL and LSE. The Men’s 1st VIII, who
started at the head position, were des-
perate to keep up the momentum after
their excellent win at the UH Winter
Sprints, and looked strong and deter-
mined as they rowed under Kew Road
bridge, encouraged by chants from the
ICSM supporters. The Men’s 2nd VIII
were also an example of force as they
intimidated the surrounding crews.
After their performance at the UH
Sprints, where despite having been
placed best UH crew, they lost to UCL
Novices after a tough fight in the final,
the Novice Boys were determined to
claim back the gold medal they won
at the UH Novice Sprints, where they
took the rest of the UH clubs by storm.
Both Novice Boys crews flew strongly
under Kew Road Bridge, much to the
pleasure of their Captain, Vin Nade-
saligam, who cheered from the bridge,
along with the rest of the ICSM sup-
port, which consisted not only of boat
club members but also other friends,
parents, brothers, sisters, making us
by far the best supported club on the
bridge!
The results were announced at the
annual UH Dinner, once again held
at Tiger Tiger. A good evening turned
into a great one as it was announced
that the women of ICSM had won the
Novice, Intermediate and Senior cate-
gory, entirely dominating the women’s
races. Looks of surprise, exhilaration
and disbelief spread across everyone’s
faces – rowers, coxes and coaches ut-
terly overjoyed at all their efforts final-
ly paying off in what felt like one of the
proudest moments the ICSM Women’s
Squad had ever had the privilege of
experiencing. It got even better as the
men did us proud, coming second in
the Intermediate and Novice catego-
ries despite fierce competition from
the numerous other clubs entered.
The real partying had only just begun
as everyone drank and danced into the
night, forgetting for a while that de-
spite our victories, we will inevitably be
back in our boats, training hard to stay
ahead of the UH clubs, sooner than
you can say “THREE MORE GOLD
MEDALS!”
