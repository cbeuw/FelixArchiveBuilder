Justice do coke
and punk is dead
C
oca-Cola have hired the
French electro duo Jus-
tice and So Me (the chap
who is responsible for all
those snazzy Ed Banger
graphics) to design an exclusive coke
bottle which will exclusively be sold
in exclusive nightclubs across Europe.
Somehow I think those suits at Coke
got the wrong idea when someone told
them how popular coke is in European
nightclubs...
But they aren’t alone, it seems a lot of
otherwise respectable artists have been
cashing in on their personal brands
lately. Iggy Pop’s craggy face hassles
me about car insurance every time I
pass through a train station and for a
while, Johnny Lydon tried to make me
buy butter every morning as I walked
to Vauxhall bus station. But are they
selling out? In this modern age, is it
all okay to make money however you
want? Do we still care about that raw
punk integrity that made such musi-
cians icons in the first place?
Well I do.
If I found out that my punk idols like
Patti Smith and Thurston Moore had
their face plastered up and down the
country with slogans like “Privilege
(you don’t have to be posh)” and “in-
cinerate... your debts”, my heart would
shrivel like a deflated balloon. I would
feel betrayed and let down. These are
the people we look up to because they
have made their way in the world by
fighting against conformity and mun-
danity, kicking back and saying “this is
what we believe in, and we will make
ourselves heard!”.
These are the people that console us
when we feel like the world is corrupt
and runs on money alone. Punk was
all about freedom of self expression;
opposing injustices and prejudices;
breaking down race, gender, and class
barriers; and refusing to take part in
the rich extorting the poor. In the case
of Iggy Pop, he isn’t even eligible for in-
surance from Swiftcover because they
don’t cover musicians, due to them
being statistically far more likely to
damage their cars. He is supporting
a company that discriminates against
the very thing he is!
But is it all alright, because selling
yourself like this is simply letting oth-
ers profit from you without you having
to do anything other than be yourself?
Maybe the “they sold out!” reaction is
simply projecting your own hippy eth-
ics onto other people.
Maybe it’s cool to sell your personal
brand because at the end of the day you
are the one who gets the biggest slice of
the pie. And who cares what everyone
else thinks, after all, not caring about
what other people think of you is the
most punk ethic there is.
If it were up to me, ads would be
narrated by David Mitchell as a talk-
ing dog. All ads in the future should be
narrated by David Mitchell as a dog.
Even the consequences of drug use are
much less patronising to listen to when
it’s the voice of the guy who once pis-
sed in his work colleague’s desk drawer
and drew a swastika love heart on a
Post-it.

“Falling in love
for the first
time, against
the backdrop of
an old cassette
player spitting
out “broken
Hallelujah’s”
Having been tipped as the next big
thing as long ago as 2007, Emmy the
Great’s self-produced debut album
First Love has been long awaited in
anticipation.
Vocalist Emma Lee Moss has been
labelled as another indie kid huddling
under the ‘anti-folk’ umbrella with
Noah and the Whale and Laura Mar-
ling. While she denies that this was
her intention, she doesn’t seem overly
bothered by the classification. Re-
freshingly, she lacks the strive-to-be-
different-at-all-costs mentality which
afflicts so many of today’s generic pop
bands. She doesn’t arrogantly claim to
have created her own genre or broken
any boundaries: she’s just made a really
good album.
Her voice is youthfully girlish and al-
though naïve throughout, the album is
upfront and often quite brutally hon-
est. Putting it on for the first time and
listening to it in the background, you’ll
probably think it a lively and sweet first
album whilst happily humming along
over your coffee – but giving the words
a proper listen gives the release a quite
alarming new dimension and before
you know it your coffee’s gone tepid
and you’re feeling pretty glum.
It all starts with ‘Absentee’. It’s a mel-
ancholy tune about bereavement but
the vocals are fresh and the lyrics are
ruthlessly truthful. This is followed by
one which you may have heard already
– the track ‘We Almost Had a Baby’,
which was released as a single in No-
vember last year. The cringe-worthy
lyrics (which begin “You didn’t stop
when I told you to stop” and continue
to describe her hopes of pregnancy
to gain control over an ex-boyfriend)
physically make me squirm. It’s sung
in such a way that even though at first
you, of course, assume it’s a bit of joke,
by the end the serious tone has you
worrying about Emma’s mental health.
But it’s simple and strangely likeable
and when you stop wincing, you just
might really enjoy it.
Her lyrics continue to be the most
charmingqualityofthealbumthrough-
out. The songs are clever and unique
and all quite sad. She confesses herself
that she was no musical prodigy, and
you can tell that her attitude towards
writing isn’t to tick any boxes: there are
no anthemic choruses and she certain-
ly doesn’t try to water down her songs
into some vague sentiments that eve-
ryone can relate to. She just says what
she thinks.
The title track is definitely one which
stands out on the album. It is laced
through with the tune of Leonard Co-
hen’s ‘Hallelujah’ and is written about
– guess what? Falling in love for the
first time, against the backdrop of an
old cassette player spitting out “broken
Hallelujah’s”. It’s just lovely. The last
track, ‘City Song’, definitely deserves a
mention too. It’s another love song, or
more accurately a ballad of lost love. It’s
After five years of recording singles, Emmy the Great finally
releases her debut album of heartbroken love songs.
really nice: the guitar strums faintly in
the background whilst her stark voice
and elegant lyrics take the limelight
for the last time. There’s even a chance
that a few tears might drop into that
cold coffee of misery by this point.
In short, I think this is an artist who
is in danger of getting a lot more criti-
cism than she deserves from cynics
who haven’t really gotten the point. It
takes a good listen and it’s definitely a
grower. Even though the lyrics are a bit
depressing, it somehow has a youthful
and carefree sound about it. You can
tell that she doesn’t take herself too
seriously, and behind the pessimistic
and mildly aggressive words hide self-
depreciating lyrics and a very genuine
modesty. The result is a really intimate
album which seems to say “everything’s
pretty terrible. Let’s just get over it.”
Hopefully, there will be much more to
come.
Thanks to those of you who did my
album quiz and emailed in with your
quiz results, I never expected you all to
get so many, it makes me feel warm and
fuzzy to know there are lots of people
lurking around Imperial who are quite
into music and who also read felix. I
knew you were out there! I may find
a way to incorporate this into a regular
feature every fortnight, by popular de-
mand. Of course. Amazingly, a group
of people from way over in Silwood
Park got every single one right. Eve-
ryone who emailed me got the single.

their time in their bedroom twiddling

Franz Ferdinand’s debut album, if you
can remember that far back, was pretty
groundbreaking stuff. It was the first
time the mothers of Britain and their
sons were listening to the same band at
the same time, and was the catalyst that
started the gradual merging of Radio 1
and Radio 2 that continues to this day.
Looking back over the track list today,
there isn’t one song that I don’t think
wasn’t a single, or at least it seems that
way to me. Is that because the songs
were all so catchy, or just because they
all sounded the same?
Whilst an interesting question, this is
beside the point because it was a good
record all the same and won the 2004
Mercury Prize for its quality. The fol-
low up, You Could Have It So Much
Better, was less same-y but (some
might argue, consequently) less popu-
lar. Musically it was still credible and
enjoyable to more die-hard music fans
but The Franzes had strayed from their
winning formula and the album faded
quickly into indifference compared to
the kingly reverence its predecessor
had enjoyed amongst the Jonothanros-
sian masses. After this, Franz Ferdi-
nand disappeared for some time. Now
though, they are back, with a third al-
bum, Tonight.
Tonight is like a Wikipedia tour of
popular music compared to their de-
but, which was more like a massive
fuck-off book all about one topic (‘Syn-
copation for Dummies’). Each track is
a sortie into a new genre, but all with
a distinct Franz Ferdinand twist. It’s
got disco beats with funky bass-lines.
It’s got folky finger-twiddling on
acoustic guitar. It’s got crunchy
electro riffery. It’s even got
what could pass as a guitar
solo. It would be something
of a stretch to say this album
had something for everyone
– Jay-Z fails to make an ap-
pearance and there are no
violin concertos, but the
average guitar pop afi-
cionado should be eas-
ily satisfied.
Listening to this al-
bum is something of
a challenge. It is lightly
spattered with medioc-
rity, evenly distributed
throughout so that
you are repeatedly al-
lowed to just begin to
enjoy yourself when
the next bit comes and ruins every-
thing. After about half an hour of
this torment you will find your toler-
ance waning and your finger edging
towards the skip button with steadily
increasing fre- quency. If you make
it all the way through
‘Lucid Dreams’, you’re made of sterner
stuff than I.
Tonight represents the next stage in
Franz Ferdinand’s attempt to distance
themselves from their debut and rede-
finethemselves.LikewhenChristopher

series, the band gave up on a

good thing far too early and have still
been unable to replace it. Whilst there
are some tolerable foot-tappers on here
and a couple of genuinely good songs,
there are also moments when you can
actually feel the drudgery weighing
down your shoulders as you
listen. Be aware that if you
listen to these tracks all
the way through, your
spirit will be crushed
for ever.

Anthony Joseph & the Spasm Band
Album Launch party next Thursday
Music felix has teamed up with An-
thony Joseph & the Spasm Band for
the launch party of the fantastic album
Bird Head Song at Cargo this Thurs-
day. If you head along with your Impe-
rial Student ID, you’ll be let in for the
well cheap price of £5. Awesome.
That’s not all, we’ve also got a free
download of the song ‘Vero’ for you to
enjoy. Head over to www.musicglue.
com/anthonyjoseph to check it out.
The critically acclaimed album takes
its name from Antony’s childhood
nickname as he grew up in Trinidad.
Moving from the Caribbean to London
has had a huge affect upon the sound
of Anthony’s music, which clearly has
an eclectic list of influences. The funky,
free-jazz feel of the music fits well with
the spoken poetry and vocals that are
so reminiscent of Beat poets of yester-
year. The launch party runs from 7pm
till 1am at Cargo in Shoreditch.
