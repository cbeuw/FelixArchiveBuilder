Luella Bartley
British Fashion Designer of the
Year 2008. Luella, 34, revived
punk in her AW09 collection.
Luella says she doesn’t do
make up, doesn’t do hairdo.
Poor Victoria, trying way too
hard doesn’t make you a good
designer OK?
Neon Pink Lips
It’s just cool OK?
Boater Shoes
As with all shoes, great with
the right outfit. I think boat-
ers are awesome summer
shoes, but strictly summer.
You just look a bit metrosexual
and Portugese wearing these
about College.
Afghan Scarf
It drains me, it does. Shred
the shit and flush it down the
toilet. If you are wearing this
for religious or political reason
then that’s ok. Otherwise, seek
medical help.

Day 1 - 20/02/09
13.05 Noir/Bllack Noir by Peter Ing-
wersen. Estethica event
Estethica is British Fashion Council’s
initiative to promote sustainable and
eco-clothing for high end fashion.
“1.5million tonnes of unwanted cloth-
ing ends up in landfills in the UK each
year”. Biodegradable clothing now
then?
As a huge fan of Scandinavian fash-
ion, I counted down in milliseconds
for the opening of the Danish Show.
26 Avril Lavigne lookalikes strutted
down the runway in what I can only
call a “New Look” wardrobe. One of
the models actually rolled out of bed
dragging her linen with her. Opening
an Estethica event with such an unim-
aginative line has drained any hope for
eco-clothing.
Noir featured bare backs with bits
ripped off plus untidily pleated silk
drape tied up with a rope equals a rapey
look. The reluctant-thumb ups go to the
leather scarves. An Afghan and a neck
wrap with slanted military buttons.
14.30 Eun Jeong by Eun Jeong Hong.
Winner of Fashion Fringe 2009
Walking away with £100,000 prize
money from Fashion Fringe. Eun
Jeong’s first solo show explains why
her designs have captured the heart of
Donatella Versace.
Superb ability at casual sporty and
romantism. Eun Jeong has succeeded
in making boyfriend unfriendly harem
pants interesting. One piece harems
that resemble a sailor’s overall. Bum
hugging harems in silk with loosely
fitted legs and bulging pleated pock-
ets in see-through. Then comes a
perfectly executed pea coat mutation.
Low breadth and big round buttons in
fluorescent pink wool with a heavily
embroidered floral inner hood. Evening
wear consisted of surreal haute couture
elements. A huge thumb up for the
highly frivolous but elegant beige bub-
blish evening gown.
Kawai: Inspiration for the collection?
Eun Jeong: Both my parents are fash-
ion designers so I always get ideas from
them. Also V for Vendetta. Everything
originates from love.
K: How did it feel winning the Fash-
ion Fringe?
EJ: The minute I won, sponsors were
flocking to me which was a surprise. I
received a lot of help in terms of busi-
ness from the Fashion Fringe people.

was impossible to get tickets. Managed
to sneak backstage to take a few snaps.

stuff looked like on catwalk...
Day 2 - 21/02/09
12.30 John Rocha by John Rocha
A CBE for his contribution to fashion.
British Fashion Designer of the Year
2004. Of Hong Kong/Portuguese her-
itage and Ireland based designer.
Good Show. Playful but the femininity
and the seriousness was still there. The
collection was like John’s complicated
background: Victorian, 60s, futuristic.
Brilliant and quirky cushiony acces-
sories. Huge puffy alice bands comes in
cotton or fur. V-shaped neckline with
two puff collars on the side fitted to an
otherwise boring tube topped peplum
dress. The peplum is also glammed
up by sewed on wavy embellishment
on flexible see-through material. The
reinforced rim on the peplum gives a
nice contrast to the frivolous and fluid
tulle/chiffon used on the skirt.
Ingenious tweed swimsuit like mail-
lot, perfect fine ruffles on the entire
front. Loosely fitted morning gown
like coat. Impressive.
Another applause for the Princessy
Victorian removable collar with chiffon
pleating held together by an elasticated
ribbon. Also bean shaped oversized
black leather clutch box complete with
round the side bold silver zip.
The men’s collection is definitely
manly and barbaric. Started off with a
ruthlessly oversized and shapelesss fur
coat that reminded me of a bear. Then
a furry SS overcoat with a thin belt
above the waist. Also a tweed suit that
has mocked tailor marks as details.
Day 3 - 22/02/09
9.15 Betty Jackson by Betty Jackson
First solo show in 1981. British Fash-
ion Designer of the Year 1985. Once a
visiting professor at the RCA; current
trustee of V&A and a CBE. Has Betty
shown design fatigue?
The show started with a shocking
short homespun woollen wrap tied up
with a huge bow in front. It was shock-

ing in an untidy and sloppy way.
Other than this, the show was pleas-
ant and has stuck to the safe and con-
servative design. Betty has recycled
some old ideas, high-waisted, loose
and cropped trousers tied with a bow
at the waist. Mini cardigans above the
waist in cashmere are pleasant but will
prove a difficult combo for Betty’s pre-
dominant client range. Good for us
young and daring though.
There are some interesting pieces
however. Velvety full length dress with
squared and heavily padded shoulder.
Lovely details of the bulky folds on
the side. It is a Betty Jackson show, the
printed fabric won’t go amiss. Acces-
sories: looped and looped long earrings
that touch the collar bones. All in all,
the show was good but lacked the spice
that makes you feel fully satisfied.
10.30 Peacock by Shane and Falguni
Peacock
The Mumbai fashion duo’s work is now
stocked by Harrods since their first
show in London last September. The
sexy and feminine style is reminiscent
of Dolce & Gabbana.
A refreshing collection that celebrate
the curvaceous and the sexy shapes
of women. Utterly jaw dropped at the
sheer quality and detailed embellish-
ments on all of their dresses. Insanely
chaotic decorative embroidery but
cooperated extremely well. In fact if it
weren’t for the top craftsmanship and
the sharp designer instinct at the add-
ons, the dresses would have looked
boring and tedious.
Not only was the embroidery work
satisfying, the design and the cutting
of the dresses were equally pleasing.
Exotic huge bare backs comes in slit-
ted diamond shapes or kite shapes.
Golden zips give dresses a strong and
hardened edge.
Betty Jackson’s fashion accident?
From left: The infamous Betty
Jackson style print fabric and the
loopy earrings. A straight velvet
dress with folded details.
Perfect mix of all types of fluidy fab-
rics – silk, chiffon, feather… Lovely and
orderly blend. Perfect evening gowns
to grab attention.

Youtube. Search for “Falguni & Shane
Peacock S/S 09 at On Off”.
17.30ReembyReemAlasadi.On|Off
Exhibition, Science Museum
A regular at Toyko and London Fash-
ion Week for off schedule shows. Reem
demonstrated a sophisticated mixture
of influences stemmed from her many
years of selling personalised vintage
clothes in Portobello Market.
The level of details; the intricasy of
the craftsmanship; the fabric the col-
lection uses rival the genuine couture
houses. Although not all pieces re-
ceived top level tailoring, the silhou-
ette and the creativity is undoubtedly
plausible. A self-taught designer and
a very articulate business woman, Fe-
lix had a small interview with her and
tried on a few pieces!
Kawai: Fashion recycles. What is so
special about the style in this century?
Reem: It has to be fucked up bits. I
mean look at this! (Points to her rapey
looking white top) Mix of trainers on
evening gowns or suits...
K: Do you believe in trends?
R: I don’t follow trends. But no mat-
ter how trendy you are everybody in-
evitably gets influenced by it.

bowed to the heavy applause in the au-
ditorium. My hands were sore.
Space invader shoulders on a fitted
A-line dress. Long and folded pock-
ets on another colourful A-line knee-
length dress with corseted tube top.
Beautifully origami folded dresses
were supremely tailored to acquire a
clean and tidy 3D shape.
Printed fabrics were used extensively
in the collection. Henry VIII, pearls
and various accessories add edginess
and romance to some of the boyish
jackets. The symmetric V-Shaped tie
dyed jacket on gabardine has fully uti-
lised the pattern.
Felix was backstage hoping to inter-
view William. We ended up chatting to
his grandpa instead…
Kawai: What is William like?
Grandpa: An extremely humble
young man. We drove round to pick
him up for tea … (5 minutes later) and
he is a very talented young man. He got
9A for his GCSEs.
K: When did William start to take an
interest in fashion?
G: Since after school really.
K: Are there any fashion influence in
the family?
G: Myself and my son are
engineers…
No wonder why William’s designs
have so much structure and tidiness on
top of the pleasing aesthetic then.

Tips for Blaggers
W
hen it comes to
a fashion show,
having tickets
don’t necessarily
guarentee entry.
PR people invite more people than
they can actually accommodate. If
you are opportunistic enough, you
can get in anywhere. Read these, be
smart and you are backstage!
1. Look Away!
Don’t make eye contact with any
PR/doorman. They will stop you and
ask for a ticket.
2. How does the invitation look
like?
Always check out the size and
shape of the invitation. Hold a
piece of paper/envelope as you walk
through the barrier.
3. Follow...follow...
Stand behind someone who has a
ticket. Chat to her - “Who do you work
for?”, “How did you get the tickets?”.
Make people think that you are friends
or workmates. Tail her closely. When
she goes through... And voila, you are
in a show.
4. Who are the sponsors?
Find out in advance who sponsors
the show – MAC? L’Oreal? Toni&Guy?
Strut up to the bouncer and tell them
you are a rep/photographer/reporter/
correspondent for the company.
5. Borrow some kit!
Incredibly popular show? Go to the
venue two hours in advance. Drag a
metallic photographer case. Hold a
stand if possible. Head backstage.
Don’t have tickets to a show? Want to get backstage?
Kawai Wong has 10 ways to blag her way into shows.
6. I am a very important assistant...
Hilary Alexander/Colin McDowell’s
assistant.
7. I am involved in the collection...
“I’m the embroiderer”; “I’m the seam-
stress”; “I designed the shoes”; “I am an
apprentice”. Make sure you can back up
your little fibs...
8. Look bombastic!
Always dress up and I mean DRESS
UP (hair, ears, shoes…) Strut your way
through as if you belong there.
9. A great personality helps!
Be nice, a bit shy, but definitely con-
fident. PR people never want to piss
anyone off.
10. Now sit back and enjoy!
Make sure you chat to people. They
may even get you into an aftershow
party!
