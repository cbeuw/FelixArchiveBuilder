Learning about the opposite sex
After their very successful survey on what the opposite sex really wants, Every Nation Christian present the
debate that complemented it. As before, Tosin Ajayi tells us all

Friday 27 February 2009 felix
A
couple of weeks ago, the
observant amongst you
would have noticed this
poster all over campus,
the fortunate would have
answered a survey about the opposite
sex relating to the poster, and the really
switched on would have seen the re-
sults of the 2009 Opposite Sex survey
in felix two issues ago.
But the truly, divinely, blessed at-
tended the event it all centred about.
Understanding The Opposite Sex 2009
in the Elec Eng foyer. With the Elec
Eng Café transformed (well, this time
the food was free), the evening kicked
off with the results of the survey pre-
sented in a Family Fortunes (check
YouTube if that makes no sense) style.
In an attempt to ‘decide once and for
all’ which sex understands more about
the other, a team of four girls took
turns guessing what were the top five
answers which guys gave to the survey
questions.
Their opponents were a group of four
guys guessing answers to the reverse
questions, with 10 points awarded for
the top answer, 8 for the next, and so
on.
The girls’ team captain Lakshmi
Sreenivasan had assembled a crack
squad that promptly proceeded to
romp through the first question “What
do men look for in women?”– getting
four out of five questions right.
The men were an altogether less
cohesive unit; only guessing the top
one and the bottom two answers right
when asked “What do women look for
in men?” Team captain James Green-
halgh also took to arguing with other
team members and openly berated
one, proclaiming “They don’t want
that!?” when a team member suggested
‘Commitment’ as an answer.
This was a trend that repeated it-
self throughout the questions with
the men rapidly falling behind. Due to
some technical glitches, during which
the word ‘Boobs’ randomly popped
up on the screen as an answer to the
question “What do women think men
look for?” Some answers were revealed
before the women had time to guess
and although this wasn’t their fault,
the ladies lost a couple of guesses, giv-
ing the men an ever-so-slim chance
of catching up. One which the men
didn’t really grab until the final ques-
tions; “What is the most important ele-
ment to a successful relationship?” and
“Which one thing can most jeopardise
a relationship?” when they hit on the
not immediately obvious yet ingenious
ploy of giving the exact same answers
as the women did, who had answered
before them.
50 points were up for grabs in each
category for the most random answer
given for each question, but with an-
swers such as “Someone with hand-
cuffs”, “Someone just as messed up as
they are” and “When you tell lies, make
them believable”. It’s perhaps no sur-
prise that both teams failed to get even
one of these bonus answers.
In the end, the ladies ran out com-
fortable 80 – 72 winners. A win that
would have been a lot more emphatic
without the aforementioned points-
robbing technical glitches.
The floor was then handed to Wolf-
gang (Wolfi) Eckleben, a Pastor of
Every Nation Church London, a man
who spent 5 years at university (a
5-year course he assures us), and has
been successfully married for 18 years.
He started off by asking the audience
to guess whether certain objects were
male or female before revealing what
the answer was and why (e.g. Compu-
ter – male: in order to get their atten-
tion, you have to turn them on).
This being a Christian run event, the
bible was whipped out, with one of his
opening gambits being Matthew 19:
4-6 focussing on the phrase “… at the
beginning God made them male and
female…”
His main point here was that as men
and women, we are obviously different
and not only that but also God created
us that way. After warning everybody
that what he was about to talk about
were generalisations, he went on to
outline some of the ways in which we
are different and some of the problems
that come from that, this included in-
terviewing a married couple, Greg and
Suzanne Albrecht, who had been mar-
ried a year, after only knowing each
other a year, cue surprised gasp from
audience.
Most of what they said seemed to
back up Wolfi’s earlier quote – “There
are two times in life men and women
don’t understand each other: before
marriage and after marriage”. However,
when asked what they’d learnt about
the opposite sex that they’d share with
others, Greg said: “Sometimes, the is-
sue is less important than the relation-
ship. If you have to, pick your time to
address it carefully. No use spoiling a
good evening over nothing” while Su-
zanne said: “Respect. Men need wom-
en to show them respect”.
Wolfi took over again and proceeded
to let women in on the ways men are
different, and from his experience,
vice versa. He started by talking about
the way we think. Whilst it would be
hard to dispute his assertion that men
are compartmentalised creatures who
deal with one thing at a time, prefer
to bottle emotions up until they make
sense or subside and can easily divorce
work-life from home-life while women
are global creatures who can superhu-
manly deal with many things at a time,
bring emotions into the marketplace
and for whom if something is wrong,
EVERYTHING is wrong; his tongue in
cheek (surely!) suggestion that this was
due to testosterone disconnecting the
two halves of the male brain drew the
loudest heckles of the night, with cries
like “References!” ringing out. Mainly
from the men though.
Of particular delight was his plea to
each sex to realise how the other sex
gets sexually turned on. Men by sight,
women by atmosphere. “Guys”, he said,
“if you need a girl’s help with some cal-
culus problem, and you ask her to meet
you at some low-lit Italian restaurant
with a guy playing the violin, you are
sending a message.”
“Girls, if you invite a guy for a pla-
tonic meal at McDonald’s and show up
in a miniskirt with a slit all the way up
the thigh and a plunging neckline, you
might just be there for a chat, but he’s
hearing something different”.
“Be aware of this, and try to only
send a message you want to. A lot of
hurt will be avoided that way.”
Further comparisons made were the
differences in shopping styles, com-
munication (Men: headlines, Women:
details) and crisis management.
On crisis management, he stated that
men like to take a problem away, hide
and conquer it. And only then come
out and tell everyone ‘I did it!’, with-
out understanding or knowing this, a
woman might try and force him to talk
about this and wonder why he seems to
grow distant.
Women on the other hand, want to
talk through the problem, want some-
one to empathise. However, the man,
seeing the problem and not under-
standing, might try to ride in on his
white horse and solve the problem for
the little lady, then wonder why she’s
having a go at him.
In the Q&A time, the question of
generalisations returned, especially
as some men present seemed to think
that not every woman would like the
behaviour that had been outlined, to
which Wolfi answered that the main
point was to try and figure out what
the peculiarities of a particular per-
son are and work based on that, not
on what you instinctively think you
should do. His point was: In order to
do relationships right, be prepared to
learn … a lot.
For those paying attention, the an-
swers were there and by the time the
boy (toolkit) and girl (scented candle)
raffles had been drawn, most left hav-
ing enjoyed themselves and possibly
even having learnt something.
“Due to some
technical
glitches... the
words ‘Boobs’
randomly
popped up on
the screen”
“Men are com-
partmentalised
creatures who
deal with one
thing at a time”
