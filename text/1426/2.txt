Beit Redevelopment:
The story so far
Over the past few months, major
building work has been going on inside
the Union building as part of the Phase
Two Redevelopment of Beit. Last
year, felix reported that the funding
was eventually found for Phase Two
after the College agreed to give £1.93
million towards the fund [Issue 1391
– 11.01.08].
Even though the story was reported
over a year ago, students are still con-
fused as to why parts of the Union
Building have been blocked off and
even more worrying, they didn’t seem
to know how the Union was going to
change once the construction was
finished.
At the moment, most of the work that
is going on in the Union is for the crea-
tion of a mezzanine level on the second
floor where the new Student Activity
Centre [SAC] will be stationed, which
si why parts of Db’s and DaVinci’s have
been blocked to allow room for risers.
Below the SAC the main cluster of of-
fices will be located, where all the Sab-
baticals and Union staff will be work-
ing. They layout for the Union offices
is still unsure, however the latest plans
show that they will be open plan apart
from the Union President and the
General Manager who will have their
office.
The work for Phase Two was sup-
posed to be finished by January 2009
according to last years article, but as
can plainly be seen, the contractors are
still in the Union working away. Peter
Haldane, General Manager for Impe-
rial College Union, told felix that “You
amaze me, I’d like to see what it is you
base that on.”
He then went on to explain that
“When work for Phase 2 was put in

Bill Gates gives £5 million
to Imperial College
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundations
has given Imperial College London a
£5 million grant. The money will sup-
port an initiative that is manufacturing
inexpensive home tests for HIV in de-
veloping countries.
The CD4 initiative was launched
with the aim of devising an easy to use
point-of-care test with a cost of around
$2. Currently three prototypes have
been developed, one of which will be
mass produced in 2010.
This is not the first time that the Bill
& Melinda Gates Foundations have
supported the CD4 initiative. A 2005
grant of almost £6 million supported
the first three years of the initiative.
The latest grant will go towards trials
of the device in developed and devel-
oping countries as well as funding ini-
tial production runs.
Measuring a patients CD4+ T-cells
is a critical part of the HIV treatment
process. Healthcare workers rely on a
CD4 count to make decisions about
antiretroviral therapy. Many patients
in developing countries do not have
access to CD4 testing because of cost
and the fact that specially trained op-
erators are needed. The new test will
not involve electronis or mechanical
parts, it will tell patients within min-
utes if antiretroviral treatment should
be started.
“There has been a lot of progress
increasing access to life-saving HIV
drugs in the developing world, but the
lack of access to essential diagnostic
tests like a CD4 test is a major barrier
to providing the best possible care,”
said Dr Hans-Georg Batz, Director of
the CD4 Initiative from the Division of
Medicine at Imperial College London.
“The majority of patients start anti-
retroviral therapy based on symptoms
alone. Research shows that if you wait
until you’re sick to start treatment, you
have a much poorer outcome than if
you start based on CD4 count. Our
new test will have a huge positive im-
pact for people living with HIV across
the world.”
Dr Steven Reid, the project manager
for the CD4 Initiative at Imperial Col-
lege London, added that the reduced
time waiting for a result was a great
step forward: “In resource-poor rural
areas, patients sometimes have to walk
miles to get to a clinic. Even if a tra-
ditional CD4 count is offered, the pa-
tients have to come back in a couple of
weeks for the result. By then, some are
too sick or cannot afford to return. For
One of the richest men in the world, Bill Gates, has donated money to
Imperial on a number of occasions

APOLOGY TO THE RECTOR
In part two of the interview with the Rector Sir Roy Anderson,
which came out in Issue 1425 (20.02.09), an error was made. felix
quoted the Rector as saying “I have no trouble with high quality
researchers saying that they don’t have time for teaching” whereas
in fact he actually said “I have no truck with high quality research-
ers saying that they don’t have time for teaching.”
felix apologises for the mistake made
and any problems that this misquote
could have caused.

others, it may already be too late.”
The Bill & Melinda Gates Founda-
tion has also made contributions to
Imperial in other areas. In 2005 a
grant of £15 million was given to Im-
perial from the Grand Challenges in
Global Health Initiative programme
of research sponsored by the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation. The money
was divided between the development
of drugs for the treatment of latent TB
and the development of genetic strate-
gies to block the spread of malaria by
mosquitoes.
Bill Gates holds an honorary Doctor-
ate of Science (Medicine) from Impe-
rial College London.
hand the programme indicated com-
pletion in mid June 2009. That was
delayed by 6 weeks as electrical issues
came to light; identifying, tracing and
terminating old circuits. However, the
programme has now been extended to
include the extra work, fitting out the
2nd floor West as new Union offices,
which was not included in the origi-
nal Phase 2 programme but has been
made possible by Phase 2 coming in
under budget. The contractor expects
to have all aspects of Phase 2 complet-
ed by mid September 2009.”
The final work to be carried out in
the Union will focus on the remodel-
ling of the ground floor, which will
include the expansion of Da Vinci’s
kitchen to connect with DB’s servery,
which will mean that hot food can be
served on both sides. Other work will
include refurbishment Da Vinci’s and
Union Bar, including cellar modifica-
tion, as well as a redesign of Db’s. As
far as felix is aware, the redesign will
see the stage moved to the back of the
room, creating a bigger open space
and a better, concentrated focus on the
stage for different acts.
Hopefully the new and improved
Union will be ready just after the new
year for students to enjoy.
Visa fee hike will deter
valuable overseas students,
fear Vice-chancellors
The Government’s plans to reorgan-
ise the entry of overseas students is
putting higher education into jeopardy,
vice-chancellors fear. Rising visa appli-
cation costs are the latest development
in a line of measures the Government
have implemented to administrate the
considerable proportions of foreign
students at British Universities.
The Home Office’s fee for a student
visa application has already increased
from £99 to £145. Further mandatory
costs that potential students must pay
to even apply at British universities are
set to increase. Students applying for
Visas extensions by post in 2009-2010
will now cost each individual £357, £63
more than the current fee. In-person
applications will incur a £65 increase
to £565.
Vice-chancellors are worried whilst
the fee increases are not massive, they
will be combined with several new
measures to ensure the governance
of overseas students. This in turn will
deter the most talented students from
enrolling at UK universities, many who
are also courted by American, Austral-
ian and European universities.
Diana Warwick, chief executive of
Universities UK, an umbrella group
for UK vice-chancellors said: “The in-
crease in fees will come at the same
time as a number of other changes in
the UK’s immigration system and the
UK government is in serious danger of
sending out a message that it does not
welcome international students.”
Last August saw the announcement
that Universities and colleges will be
required to “sponsor” students that are
applying. These institutions first must
be licensed by the UKBA. Effectively,
it will make the visa application for
international candidates much more
difficult. Felix further reported last
year the introduction of compulsory
ID cards being issued for international
students renewing their VISA.
More than 100,000 students from
Dan Wan

abroad commenced an UK degree
programme for the 2008 intake. These
numbers include undergraduate and
postgraduate courses. Warwick argues
these “international students contrib-
ute far more to the UK academically,
culturally and financially than they use
in terms of public resources.”
Imperial College would be severely
affected if the detriments of these
measures started to become evident,
with 34.9% of its student body inter-
national students. Imperial, a univer-
sity that prides itself on its diversity
amongst its student body, will not only
be harmed academically and socially,
but also financially. Each international
student can pay up to £35,500 per aca-
demic year for their education at Im-
perial College.
A similar impact is expected to be
seen on other Russell Group univer-
sities. However, the 1994 Group is
understandably concerned also. Paul
Marshall, executive director, said:
“International student recruitment is
so delicate that something as small as
changing the price of the visa applica-
tion fee can have a large effect on ap-
plications if students are choosing be-
tween countries and we’re charging a
lot of money up front for a visa.”
“It’s one of the things that potentially
puts people off coming here – it gives
the wrong message.”

Medics win yet another nail
biting JPR Williams Cup
Wednesday’s JPR Williams Cup was yet another nail biting and
close encounter between the Imperial Medicals and Imperial
College. With both teams in the South Premiership B and both
teams struggling in that league, the stage was set for a hard
fought battle. The crowd were certainly not disappointed. Imperial
College were dominant for most of the game, but their inability
to convert penalties to points cost them the match with the
game finishing at 7-7 at the end of regular time. In extra time,
the Medicals stepped up to the challenge and eventually won
the game 15-7. On the plus side, Imperial were named the overall
winners of the event and a full round-up will be found in the The
Rival, which will be out on the 20th March.
