Coffee Break
30 felix Friday 27 February 2009
T
his week I feel like com-
plete waste. Seriously,
after a hectic party week-
end, the recovery process
is a very long experience.
The problem is I can’t seem to fall
asleep until 6 o’clock in the morning.
With lectures at 9, it is most definitely
a hard push to get things done. This
reminds me a lot like what happened
during New Years, when I spent 3 days
in a row awake. The difference here
is that this time I just don’t have the
holiday time to catch up on sleep. Well
that is enough bitching, let me tell you
about a funny story.
It happened this Wednesday to be
precise. A friend and I were coming
back to the union, after the very enter-
taining rugby match during varsity. To
say we’ve had a couple of drinks is an
understatement. A severe one.
So, we were walking along Prince
Consort Road and were stopped in
front of the archway at Beit to talk to
another friend. Conversation com-
mences, and in order to look “cool” I
say a complicated word.
Now I won’t repeat this word, and
you will most likely never find out,
however let me assure you it sounded
very sophisticated. The mistake here
Ravi Pall
Coffee Break Editor
is that this word does not actually ex-
ist. Both of my friends here asked me
what it meant, I had no clue whatso-
ever. Man I looked like an idiot. When
I explained the reason why I used this
word, and after much deliberation, it
was apparent to my peers that this was
most definitely not a word in the Ox-
ford English dictionary.
This brought me to think that I
must actually make up a lot of words.
It’s true, if I don’t have an appropriate
word I’ll just make one up.
The problem with this is no one cor-
rects me by saying that it isn’t a real
word, so I carry on using them. My
question to you guys, the readers of fe-
lix, is do you make up words too?
If you, like me, make up random
words to fit the situation, email us at
coffee.felix@imperial.ac.uk. In other
news, an apology from Kadhim Shub-
ber, who totally messed up the coffee
break page last week, by dropping the
lines of the bottom of the text boxes.
EPIC FAIL comes to mind. Seriously
what a mug. If your going to help me
out on the twitter competition, do me
a favour and post how much you hate
him. He deserves it.

Virgo
Your mum tells
you that you dad is
actually your uncle
and that the milk-
man is your brother.
You think you are
dreaming but as you pinch yourself you realise
that tour weeni-peeni is stuck in your sister.
Man your life is fucked up. And your name is
definitely not Charles.
Scorpio
This week you get a
piece of course work
back and, as ever, check
what the marker has
to say. You are shocked
and appalled when you
find this garbage written at the bottom of the page:
“Proof read your text before handle it in!” and
“Good content but poor written.” Seriously what
the fuck! What gives them the right to criticise
your spelling and grammar when they clearly
can’t do it themselves. Don’t believe me, check out
the next page where there is a picture of the said
document.
Libra
This week you go
home to visit your
family. You arrive at
your door, ring the
door bell as your
keys aren’t working,
only to be greeted by complete strangers. Oh
no, your family moved without telling you.
Poor thing, you family hate you. Luckily it’s not
just our family, but the rest of the world as well.
Nothing left to do but crystal meth.
Capricorn
You finally realise that
the horoscopes section
is a little to in-jokey.
No one cares about
your stupid twitter
accounts, stop wasting
this space which could be filled with valuable
stuff. Fuck it, I don’t care anymore, I’m deleting
your last three entries and replacing it with this
tripe. But don’t worry, hopefully next week we’ll
be back on form. Pint?
Sagittarius
Last week you left
your fellow editor
to do the whole
section on his own.
Unfortunately for him
he has a broken thumb
and watching him trying to type was so funny
that you let him do it again this week.
Cancer
Your cuntflap of a
friend tries to make
a cleaver pun on the
acronym WOW by
pronouncing it woe.
You argue with him,
and eventually burn his facial features off, until
he become a gruesome replica of ghost rider.
Too bad he doesn’t have a motorcycle, but a
shitty one speed push bike. Man he’s a cunt,
why the fuck is he still sitting here with me.
Gemini
You watch some of
your fresher pull
another fresher away
from his computer
while playing world
of warcraft. The
sight isn’t pretty, with screams of death threats
echoing in the quad. The +170 xp in rage will
defeat your level 4 dick head friend, and all will
be restored in the kingdom. WOW forever!!!
Leo
This week you meet
a cute American girl
who looks kind of
like Laura Mar-
ling. “Perfect!” you
think and all is well.
Unfortunately later in the night you find her
in the casted arms of a fellow felix editor. You
consider fighting to the death for her vagina
but realise you’d probably get pwned... Have
you seen this guy when he’s angry??!?! kthxbai!
Taurus
This week you get a
twitter account, and
begin a competition
with another felix
editor. In the process
of being obsessed
with this internet fad, you become the ultimate
Imperial College geek, for just a moment. You
feel so filthily that you decide to viciously stab
your eyes out with a nearby USB stick. Your
tears of blood gain you no sympathy.
Aries
This week, Imperial
college number 10
shows that he the
hands and vision
of god. Too add
you can never be
so good. Maybe it’s because you’re blind, and
have no hands, or maybe it’s because you’re a
waste of space who watches a blank TV all day.
Who knows, either way, why don’t you fuck
off. Nothing good for you this week.
Pisces
This week you
play for the medics
first team against
Imperial college.
You shirt number
is 14. You reveal to
you fellow students that you are a cheating
scum bag, and the only reason the referee
didn’t send you off is because the two of you
share the same secret. A high class South Ken
hooker. Wait it’s no longer a secret.
Aquarius
This week you lose at
varsity. Man you’re a
loser. I can’t believe
you think you can
kick a rugby ball.
You’re only a hooker,
leave it to someone who can kick balls. Like
your ex girlfriend, who will break up with you
for being such a loser. Man sometimes life
tough, too bad it’s as good as it gets for you.
May as well get fat by eating loads of chocolate.
Last week’s winners were Möchten
sie mein Manschaft. Well done I am
overjoyed for you. Please keep writ-
ing in. Really I defiantly don’t hate you
with a passion. In fact I think I dislike
you more than the Medics, but then
gain we won Varsity and they didn’t.
Nuff said.
Special mention to Ben Hanson who
was only five seconds late in getting his
answer to us. I shall send you two tick-
ets to the Ohhhh Noooo show.
