Pick up games magazine ANOTHER CASTLE next Friday
“Jade Goody may
have realised,
perhaps as we all
will one day, that
whatever lies in
store after death is
irrelevant”
T
he death of Jade Goody
will be a profound loss, as
to my mind she is one of
the more intelligent peo-
ple I have read about in re-
cent years. I am not making a sarcastic
slight on the terminally ill, I am being
entirely genuine.
She is best known for being unre-
markable. From one reality game show
to the next, from big mouthed to bigot,
she has apparently done nothing of
note for her entire life. Yet she had at
one stage amassed a fortune of over
a million pounds- and for someone
without a career or a company that
is no mean feat. She has manipulated
our collective consciousness in a way
incomparable to anything save for per-
haps the “Triumph of the Will.” From
being universally hatred- so much so
that the Indian Government didn’t
want her apologies- to universally pit-
ied so much so that the Prime Minister
himself sends his condolences is un-
precedented. I can’t fathom why this
is, aside from having the world’s best
publicist, but it seems I am being swept
up in the consensus.
For most, death is a time you need
alone. The stages of accepting death are
five, and none are particularly pleas-
ant, and Goody will go through them
like every other person on this Earth.
However when walking through the
lobby of Charing Cross Hospital, in
what was a surreal moment given the
number of “ordinary” people on the
floors above quietly suffering the same
plight, her face was on every paper in
the shop. I was genuinely surprised to
find the billboard on Fulham Palace
Road wasn’t featuring her. Instead of
time alone to grieve, she has sold her
story to the News of the World and
been interviewed by, in my opinion, the
most sickening, bile-spouting excuse
for a journalist the world has ever seen:
Carole Malone. You may remember her
as the one who recently labelled Impe-
rial College as “bigoted half-wits” in an
argument a blind, toothless raccoon
could have ripped apart. She has sold
the rights to her wedding for over £700
000, and the television rights for anoth-
er £100 000 in a macabre spectacle that
follows a dying woman to the grave.
Of course no-one really cares about
the atrocities going on around the
world, and the only reason people give
money at comic relief is a mixture of
guilt and wanting to see Noel Edmonds
gunged. As Goody will know a million
deaths is but a mere statistic and she
can use this to make the readers of the
tabloids her disciples in what may end
up being a cult movement. She is get-
ting the last laugh by cashing in on her
own despair, but we should not put it
down to greed. She knows that she has
lived by the sword, but as death faces
her already she no longer has to fear
dying by it, and is controlling her own
destiny.
But despite all of sheer revulsion this
behaviour could cause, I cannot fault
her, for a number of reasons. Arguably
she brought this on herself by ignoring
a letter telling her to have abnormal
cervical cells removed, and I suppose
(even if subliminally) she is looking for
some cathartic remedy against soci-
ety by milking it for everything it has
to offer; we can’t deny her a natural
psychological response. And I’m sure
she never had in mind the fact that
her plight would cause participation in
lifesaving cervical cancer screening to
increase by up to 21% in some areas-
something that no amount of letters
and television campaigns could ever
achieve. Above all it is said that all of
the money she earns by prostituting
herself to the media will support her
soon to be motherless children, per-
haps maternal instinct at its best.
Though none of these are really the
reasons why I will quite happily abide
by this abhorrent exploitation of termi-
nal illness. I don’t believe she is partic-
ularly brave or amazing- no more than
the million other cancer sufferers that
are being treated. It is mainly because
Jade Goody may have realised, perhaps
as we all will one day, that whatever
lies in store after death is irrelevant.
So don’t get caught up in the posters
around College or on bendy buses ar-
guing whether or not God exists and
whether to be happy- just be happy
anyway. Because when it comes down
to the final crunch, all you can do is to
abide by the universal religion of Her
Majesty’s head and try and make a bit
of cash.

atural History Museum.
London Fashion Week
entrance. 20 women.
Skinny, oriental, pretty,
black, white, tall, ugly,
fat. Prancing and dancing. A4 leaflet in
my hand. I read. I nod. I sympathise.
“…We (women) are all different in
appearance…Why is there still a ‘set
look’ that models have to conform to…
We are tired of seeing the same type
of girl represented as beautiful…It is
time for real women to be counted… A
wake up call for this incredibly preju-
diced industry is long overdue…”
If a 30 year old woman who wears
gold-loop earrings and numerous rings
on her fingers takes fashion at face
value, I understand. For these women
who actually looked like they have
some brain juice to think that Galliano
must have some unfound rage for fat
people. I offer far more sympathy for
them than to a dying Jade Goody.
Catwalk dresses have complicated
embroidery and intricate folds that just
have to be done by hand. These sam-
ples are not mass produced by lighting
needles in a factory. For a collection
that shows twice in a year, seamstress-
es have around 4 months to finish the
typical 40 pieces in a showcase. With
a piece which may cost up to 200 man
hours to make, where do they find the
time to gather models A-Z to make
specific measurements?
Even if dresses are specifically made
for models of varying sizes, what if
they drop out? A replacement who has
the same “varied height and shape”
is not easy to find. Does it mean the
dress would have to be remade, or
worse, discarded? Never forget a fash-
ion show is to demonstrate a designer’s
vision on dresses. It is not a personal
tailor show.
At the time of sewing, the dresses
were made using a standard set of
measurementswithoutknowingwhose
body they may eventually fall onto. If a
casting manager books models from
size 6-16. He is putting his head on the
chopping board. In fact, only 2 weeks
prior to the show the seamstresses
start to minor tweak the fittings for
specific models.
Designers ideally want walking dum-
mies on catwalks. Someone who looks
bland and faceless enough to not dis-
tract the audience from his creation.
Any muffin top on the side will distort
the silhouette of a dress which is tightly
fitted at the waist. Anyone larger than a
size 6 in layers of tulle, folds and bulg-
es will look like a cake. An elephant
pouncing on the spongy catwalk floor-
ing wearing heavy fabric and toppling
accessories in a pair of 4-inch stiletto
will inevitably sink through the stage.
A crowded backstage interview on
Fashion TV is not a pretence filmed
in a studio. Photographers, broadcast-
ers, PRs, sponsors, make-up artists,
hair dressers, models, seamstresses,
assistants... If you have seen the real
backstage, you will stroke the sardine’s
head and offer condolences next time
you open a tin. Until architects come
up with elastic walls, people need to
be flexible enough to navigate through
the non-existent space.
Whether or not one views models as
“the perfect women” is really a matter
of personal taste. I once wondered why
Burberry employed a horse for their ad
campaign. It turned out to be Agyness
Deyn. Kate Moss has eyes that perma-
nently stare sideways. Karl Lagerfeld
said “Heidi Klum always has a stupid
smile on her face”, and her boobs are
“too big for catwalks”. But Agyness has
that quirkiness that can sustain the
chaotic styles that are currently domi-
nating the catwalks. Kate has the im-
peccable versatility to carry any dress
and murder any camera. Heidi has the
best bum. Ever.
There are always criteria people have
to conform to for certain professions.
I have never seen anyone to appeal for
varying levels of stupidity in doctors. I
honestly can’t see a drooling and dazed
kid cutting open someone’s gut. Cat-
walk models are required to be shape-
less and slender, just like doctors are
required to be smart.
Failing to acknowledge the rea-
sons why catwalk models need to be
thin, the campaigners are articulate
enough to appreciate the truthfulness
of a Dove advert. “Women, be happy of
what you’ve got”! So why does skinny
and tall people – who cannot control
their metabolic rates - are worth their
trouble to empty a slot on their busy
diaries to dance on the street then?
Are you genuinely happy or genuinely
overshadowed by the skinnies? Jeal-
ousy wraps in good will is still jealousy
at the end of the day. If not hypocrisy.
