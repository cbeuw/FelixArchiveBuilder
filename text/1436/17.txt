Riding
and Polo
set for a
week in
Argentina
B. Loody-Doit
Spirits were high as the inaugural ICU
winter polo tour got under way, though
some were definitely more excited
than others. Trish’s cry of “Argentina
Baby!” must have been heard across
the whole of Gatwick as the main
group headed to check-in. However,
the mood was somewhat dulled when
we realised that the phrase ‘you get
what you pay for’ applies just as well
to airlines as anything else. The delays
led to the fastest transfer Madrid air-
port has ever seen as they were faced
with a crazed German charging down
the corridor followed by an entourage
of high velocity and rather apologetic
polo players.
We did eventually make it to Bue-
nos Aires, albeit without our luggage
(presumably it did not share our ur-
gency on the transfer). Still, all this was
quickly forgotten at the sight of our ac-
commodation; a lovely house set in the
fabulous gardens. Donning borrowed
or makeshift swimming costumes we
chose to splash around in the pool un-
til the rest of the group arrived. After
only an hour in the country the cool
water was much appreciated though
the sunburn was less welcome.
The second group arrived not long
after, having had a much less eventful
journey. After their arrival it was time
for lunch in the sun and our first taste
of Maria’s cooking – none of us were
complaining.
However we were not just there to
sun ourselves and eat great food. In
the early evening as the heat of the
day wore off we got our first chance to
ride. An hour or two was spent prac-
ticing our swings and acclimatising to
the heat before the training began in
earnest.
The first night set the tone for the
rest of the tour; dinner, beer and banter
until the early hours. Unfortunately,
bedtime brought the mosquitoes; we
were surprised at how a creature so
small can make such an irritating noise
when you are trying to sleep and most
of us were victims come morning.
Sunday was our first full day of polo,
more stick and balling with the in-
structors in the morning followed by
our first chukka of the tour. We all dis-
mounted our ponies on an adrenaline
high and looking forward to the pros-
pect of proper chukkas with the pro-
fessionals that evening.
For anyone that has not played or
seen polo it might be hard to under-
stand the appeal. It is often described
as hockey on horseback, a relatively
accurate description given we spend
our time blasting around a field hit-
ting (essentially) a hockey ball with a
long stick, but the experience is more
like Top Gear’s Hatchback Football;
you are placed in notional control of
something far bigger, tougher, faster
and more powerful than yourself and
asked to race around trying to ma-
noeuvre a ball between two posts, is
also relevant. Oh, and crucially polo is
a contact sport too…
With all this in mind we were eagerly
anticipating our matches in the after-
noon. Splitting into teams with a pro-
fessional in each one we played a small
round robin. None of us can remember
who won but we all got stuck in, trying
(and mostly failing) to get the better of
the opposing instructors.

chukkas on the full pitches. There was
some excellent play and it also gave us
a chance to meet some of the people
we would be playing with. The skill
level ranged from just above our level
to international pros.
After the chukkas we celebrated our
instructor Ollie’s birthday with the
help of the Argentine beer Quilmes.
This set the pattern for the week with
polo morning and evening, playing as
late as possible to avoid the worst of
the heat. We also got the chance to
head to La Martona and play afternoon
chukkas on the big pitches, which gave
us the space to really get into the game.
Soon even those beginners that had
come along were starting to make their
presence felt on the pitch.
Each morning soon began with our
pre-polo ritual of dressing various blis-
ters, bruises and aching joints, with the
table in the front room of the house
looking much like a small and disor-
ganised pharmacy.
On Wednesday we decided to leave
Estancia and see what life in Argentina
was really like, so we headed to Bue-
nos Aires for drinks and dinner. We
went to a trendy bar serving every-
thing from excellent Argentine beef to
amazing sushi, all washed down with
an incredible selection of drinks.
A bit worse for wear, Alex had a
rough night; upon returning to the
house to find all the doors locked he
had to spend the night curled up on
the back seat of Ollie’s car. However it
was less dangerous than the race to the
pool between Nik and Trish on com-
mandeered bicycles which almost end-
ed in disaster before Carlotta noticed
the lack of water!
For those of us with upcoming exams
Friday was the last day of the tour and
we were eager to make the most of the
final day of play.
With Ollie having to head back to
the UK in the morning to we also
gained a new instructor, Tarquin. With
Eléonore, Rosie, and Carlotta depart-
ing for Buenos Aires and their flight
home it looked set to be a quiet night,
possibly with a good night’s sleep for
a change. However, Tarquin had other
plans and invited us out to the local
town for a night out.
The bar we went to was crowded; full
of people and buzzing with conversa-
tion that none of us could understand.
One thing we did get to grips with
was the Argentine attitude to shots and
mixers. “Saying when” is difficult when
nobody knows the Spanish for ‘when’.
Having obtained the strongest drinks
in the world we grabbed a table and
began to shout conversation across the
table until the band started up.
Our Saturday morning stick and
balling was possibly the least energetic
of all our days, with a few of us looking
a bit sea-sick on our ponies. With only
a few polo sessions left though we all
hung in there to made the most of it.
Sunday was a mad rush to pack our
bags and play as much polo as pos-
sible before the flight. We cut it fine,
with traffic in Buenos Aires upping the
journey time by an hour. Jon, Megan
and Trish had to convince the staff to
hold the check in desk open while Alex
and Nik raced into the airport in the
second car. Fortunately, we all made it
onto the plane (just!).
Argentina was an incredible expe-
rience; we got to play with a range of
players from around the world and
learnt a lot. All of us were looking for-
ward to getting back and putting the
new experience to good use - although
we had to wait a little while to do it,
since our luggage arrived a couple of
days later than we did.
