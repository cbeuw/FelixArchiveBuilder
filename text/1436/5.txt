R
ecent stories in felix have
brought to our attention
the ambition of Imperial
College’s rector, Sir Roy An-
derson to privatise Imperial
College.
It is certainly the case that as things
are currently, government regulations
which cap tuition fees for home and
EU students decrease the potential
revenue of Imperial College which, in
turn, could decrease Imperial’s ability
to compete amongst academic insti-
tutions on the world stage. Given that
Imperial College has a very strong
global reputation and, year on year, at-
tracts far many more applicants than
it can accept, these facts naturally lead
those who represent the interests of
Imperial College to want to break free
of the restrictive regulatory framework
– that is, to privatise.
However, we are not all agents rep-
resenting the interests of Imperial Col-
lege, we are also human beings and we
should therefore represent the interests
of the wider human society in which
we live which is, by now, a global one.
It is in the context of the wider hu-
man society that we should look upon
the issue of privatisation of the UK’s
top universities, and that’s what I’ll try
to do below.
A quick look at the Imperial’s “An-
nual Report and Accounts 2007-8”
document reveals the large extent to
which Imperial College is reliant on
public money (UK or otherwise) for its
funding.
In 2008, Imperial’s total income was
£603.1m, of which £165.1m came from
the Higher Education Funding Council
for England (HEFCE) and £86m from
UK research councils. It is difficult to
say how much of the £50.2m contri-
bution from the EU and overseas may
have been foreign public money, but
the chances are, it is a substantial pro-
portion. Those are the ‘direct’ contri-
butions from the public purse, however
there are many mechanisms by which
public money will have reached Impe-
rial College indirectly. For example, it
is well known that many governments
(the UK government included) are
major customers of military-related
high-technology industry. It is highly
likely that such firms have contributed
substantially to the £27m that Impe-
rial received from UK industry, as well
as from the EU and overseas (the de-
tails of which companies contributed
weren’t published).
There are good economic reasons
why such a lot of public money is in-
vested in R&D. In the last century,
economic prosperity for the business
class in the UK and US has been largely
based on hi-tech innovations – most
of which were initially developed in
publicly funded sectors of the economy
within, or closely linked with universi-
ties. From semiconductors, to comput-
ers, aeroplanes, numerical processing
technologies (on which modern facto-
ries are based), container technology
(on which global trade is based) and
the Internet, to name but a few.
With this much said, it is clear that
institutions like Imperial College can-
not be ‘privatised’ in the same sense
that, say, a state-owned shop can be
privatised since it relies critically on
public money for its income, whereas
the shop can rely on its sales to its
many customers for its income. Said
another way, governments are mo-
nopolistic consumers of the products
which universities provide. Like all
monopolistic consumers, they have
the power to shape the sort of products
that the universities provide (i.e. the
sort of research that is done), by direct-
ing demand.
These observation have obvious
consequences for the talk about ‘in-
ternational competition’ between aca-
demic institutions. The competition is
predominantly for government fund-
ing, and governments tend to be loyal
consumers of the products of their
own country’s top academic institu-
tions. As a rule of thumb, a university
will be “competitive” to the extent that
it receives large funding from its home
country’s government.
The issue of privatisation, then, is not
an issue of control over the sort of re-
search that is done (since governments
will continue to largely dictate this),
but it is to do with the single issue of
whether a university should be allowed
to charge what it likes for tuition. It
boils down the question of how to dis-
tribute the costs of tuition between the
government, the individual student,
and the university. Should the student
foot the bill, the government, or Impe-
rial College?
First, however, it’s worth saying
something about what the cost of tui-
tion will be (i.e. how it will be worked
out) before addressing who should bear
this cost. Sir Roy (and Sir Richard be-
fore him) often like to point out that a
degree from Imperial College is worth
much more than a degree from most
other UK institutions. Why? It can’t be
because the teaching quality at Impe-
rial is so much better than everywhere
else – university assessments by The
Guardian, Times etc. show otherwise.
In fact, these studies also reveal that
Imperial students are among the least
happy in the UK. It’s also unlikely to be
because the resources needed to train a
student at Imperial cost a lot more than
they do elsewhere.
The determining factor for the cost
of tuition will be the strength of de-
mand for places at Imperial, and that
will be determined by the strength of
the Imperial ‘brand’ globally, relative to
the other major academic institutions
of the world.
The rational thing for Sir Roy to do
if Imperial is privatised is to whack
tuition fees up to whatever he can get
away with, given the strength of the
Imperial ‘brand’ globally.
Like it or hate it, the cost of tuition
(which will probably be born in part by
the British public and in part by the in-
dividual student) will depend, in part,
on the on the success or failure of Impe-
rial College’s continuing global efforts
to strengthen its brand. That is not to
say that the quality of research is not
a factor in the strength of the ‘brand’.
Obviously, better-funded universities
tend to produce better research, for a
variety of reasons, which contributes
to brand strength (although it seems
that there is a much weaker correlation
between brand strength and teaching
standards). If the extra cash injection
from increased tuition fees translates
into more scientific publications, and
the ‘brand’ is strengthened, we can be
sure of further rises in tuition fees – re-
gardless of the actual cost to Imperial
College per student.
How the privatisation of Imperial
will effect British society will depend
on how the ‘burden’ of tuition fees is
spread. Currently, Imperial College is
at a disadvantage with respect to its
Ivy League competitors in the US, who
can set their own fees. A far more sig-
nificant disadvantage, however, is that
US government expenditure in R&D is
far greater than here, not only because
they spend a higher percentage of their
GDP on R&D, but also because their
GDP per capita is higher than the UK’s.
Fundamentally, the choice is between
whether: (1) universities in the UK stay
with their current levels of funding i.e.
no change; (2) the government pays the
costs of better funding for universities;
(3) the individual students pay far more
than they currently do. Or some mix-
ture of the three – no doubt, via some
complicated loan/grant/reimburse-
ment scheme which governments spe-
cialise in.
Of course, if funding stays as it is, we
can be fairly sure that UK’s universi-
ties will continue to produce at current
levels. If the student pays the costs of
tuition, then the output of the top uni-
versities should increase because of
increased funding, but a highly ineq-
uitable system will have been created,
in which only the rich will be able to
afford to be educated at the top univer-
sities. Finally if the government bares
the costs, then social mobility will
probably increase, society will become
more equitable and university output
will increase, but at a cost to the tax-
payer. Who is effected most by the tax
burden will depend on how progressive
or regressive the tax system is. So on
the face of it, it seems sensible for the
government to use its power to ensure
an increase in our total university out-
put in an equitable way, by increasing
R&D spending – which would benefit
all universities, not just the top 5, and
would be a force pushing towards a
more equitable society, provided the
UK maintains (and enforces) a rela-
tively non-regressive tax system where
the wealthy take on a larger share of the
burden.
Sir Roy wouldn’t be fulfilling his in-
stitutional role, if he didn’t pursue a
policy of economic imperialism on
behalf of Imperial College. The gov-
ernment, however, is responsible for
the wider health of the system of uni-
versities and the interests of the British
people so, accordingly, should resist Sir
Roy’s imperialist desires for privatisa-
tion, whilst increasing funding for UK
universities across the board – if an in-
crease is what the British people decide
is in their interest. If, however, the gov-
ernment decides – as it is expected to
– to reduce funding for R&D in the UK
over the next few years (without any
public consultation), it isn’t surprising
that Sir Roy should rant and rave about
privatisation.
