Battle of the Wan’s...
Gok Dan
Known for: Being for being a good
way to links computers on a network.
Most likely to: Cock up and lose all
your information without any prior
warning.
Meaning of name: Wide Area
Network, or Want Anal Now? You
make your own choice- but I think the
second option is far more comical.
Hair styles: It’s a way of linking com-
puters together. Do you think that it
has hair? No you nobber.
Interesting facts: There are no facts
that are interesting about WANs. That
is unless of course you are studying
computer science. If you are the pages
are probably glued together as you are
a rather excitable bunch.
But did you know that the largest
WAN is actually the Internet! Yes that
place which has an unlimited supply of
pornographic images! Kerching!

Winner was Peter de Boeck, who also provided
some vital information, even having the audacity
to correct some: “although it should be noted that

the flow diagram you supplied does not match
the intention of the lyricist - they should be in-
terpreted as ‘No, woman, don’t cry’. ” Okkkkay.
W.A.N.
Spot the gal who just finished her exams
Known for: Being an annoying fashion
conscious tosser.
Most likely to: Oh please God be ‘die
a painful fashion related death’.
Meaning of name: His real name is
Ko-Hen Wan, which means “Noisy Big
City”
Hair styles: Fucking ridiculous, the
picture above is one of his better hair
cuts.
Interesting facts: There are no inter-
esting facts about this tosser. Just look
at his stupid elongated face. I want to
give it one hell of a smack. However in
2006, Wan was approached by Channel
4 and asked to present his own fash-
ion show, “How to Look Good Naked.
” I
thought it was pretty shit and only ever
viewed it when channel hopping. I also
broke many TVs that year... mainly
with an airborne remote control aimed
at his face.
Known for: Being an angry fashion
conscious writer, and future Editor of
this fine paper.
Most likely to: Not complete the first
issue of felix until at least two weeks
after the deadline.
Meaning of name: The name ‘Dan
Wan’ originally was first used in the
fourteenth century as a nickname for
the great Chinese emperor Waniel.
Dan stated that his parents have no
previous knowledge of this. They lie.
Hair styles: Like Gok Wan, Dan likes
to sport particularly shit hair. He also
has an ear piercing... like Gok Wan.
He also wears glasses... like Gok Wan.
He also comes from China... like Gok
Wan. Gok Wan is also gay... Dan??
Interesting facts: Like all previous fe-
lix editors, Dan is as mad as a rabbit
on cocaine. In the past this has been
required for the job.
More passed out people this week, so naturally
we will be printing all their exploits here. Obvi-
ously not for comical value- oh no. Here at felix
we want all of you to have fun after exams, but
not to cause damage to yourselves. See this as
a deterrent, so when you go for that final pint,
think... “no! what about felix...? I’ll be like one of
THEM.” You’ve been warned.
T
his week is the penultimate
issue that we will be writ-
ing for you hobos. So that
means the FUCWIT is de-
cided by the points gained
from this issue! It’s very tight at the
top of the team table, so time is of the
essence.
I must say that this year has been
pretty epic, I particularly like being able
to rant and rave at anyone or anything
in an uncensored fashion. Yes, I also
write the horoscopes. If I have upset
anyone, or if you think that I may have
taken things too far, you can piss off.
Why am I telling you this little nugget of
information now you may ask? (Proba-
bly not actually.) Well, for the next issue
I am being replaced, I cried too when I
heard, but change is for the best. I do
hope you enjoyed them.
I also wish to thank everyone who
has ever written in- seriously it makes
this ‘job’ considerably more enjoyable
when people actually do the puzzles
that I take literally minutes creating. I
know you secretly care, as when I fuck
up the abuse reigns down long and
hard, so sod you all. It has been a wee
bit shite that more people didn’t get in-
volved, but let’s fact it, Imperial is full
of ShLads. That’s a shit lad to you or I.
Anyhoo I wish to congratulate Dr Sci-
ence! for climbing so high in the FUC-
WIT. Up to P2 in only about six weeks.
Well done, a first for effort.
Finally I want to tell you about the
time when Jov (our Editor-in-Chief)
was on the phone to Diane Abbott MP.
If any of you don’t know, Jov is kind of
a big fella. Think first team Rugby prop.
He was talking to this MP, so naturally
who wouldn’t lick their finger and shove
it into his ear? Normal behaviour. Once
he put the phone down, this man erupt-
ed in a similar fashion to Mount Vesu-
vius when it destroyed Pompeii. Except
the lava was a three foot long cardboard
tube. The type you put a picture in
when you send it in the post. You know,
quite hard. I took as much as I could,
and as I lifted my leg to protect me, Jov,
the evil Serbian bastard then decided to
place a ringer right on my right ball. I
shit you not when I say I almost vom-
ited right there and then.
It was the most painful thing I have
ever felt- even worse than a Hockey
ball to the face. No contest. I managed
to stumble to the toilet in inspect the
damage. 10 minutes of groaning later,
Jov tells me that he is sorry and that Ka-
dhim has been beaten too. Why? Well
the Serbian mongrel was unable to tell
the difference between a black woman
and a Iraqi man. Kadhim pranked him.
I had the shakes for two hours. Please
come join us next year!?! Over and out.

ardcore tech fans
around the world all
gathered on the Inter-
net on Monday evening,
constantly hitting the
refresh button on the tech blogs to see
what Apple had to offer after the long
gestation period. I was one of them,
of course, as I was eager to see if my
iPhone predictions were correct.
About one hour and forty two min-
utes into the WWDC keynote, the
new iPhone was unveiled. Wait, no,
that’s the 3G surely? Nope, it really is
the new 3G S which shares the same
housing as its 3G cousin. I couldn’t
stop smiling, not only because it shat-
tered many fanboys’ dream of a video-
calling, matte black device, but also
this put an end to all those ridiculous
“leaked” pictures.
While the 3G S has adopted the one-
year old appearance, the hardware in-
side is fairly impressive, most notably
the new camera which not only takes
much greater pictures but can also
record smooth videos. You can find
out more about the new iPhone in
Marc’s article.
Despite this great internal boost,
many Apple fans expressed great dis-
appointment over the lack of major
overhauls. One member on a forum I
moderate simply accused Apple of be-
ing “afraid of changing the design, or
that they just couldn’t be bothered to
come up with a new look as suckers
will still buy the new iPhone anyway.
Even rice cookers get restyled every so
often, let alone mobile phones.”
I paused. On one hand I agree that
any company releasing a new product
in an old shell would be a potential sui-
cidal act, but on the other hand I see
no need for Apple to change the cur-
rent design, and this isn’t the first time
that Apple has made little change to a
product’s appearance.
Apple’s product lifecycles are quite
unique, with each design blueprint of
computers usually lasting for at least
two years, and at least one year for
iPod products. Most other companies
use a more aggressive and wasteful
approach to ensure that a slightly dif-
ferent looking model appears each
month, or at least give them a frequent
minor spec bump in order to let the
press know that they are still well and
alive.
Interestingly, Apple doesn’t need to
tell anyone what they are up to, leaving
people outside Infinite Loop wonder-
ing what beautiful products Steve Jobs
and co. could possibly be working on.
However, this cult-like secrecy alone
wouldn’t be enough to stir up all the
hype from each product launch – it is
the amount of attention put into each
design that wins over onlookers’.
According to BusinessWeek, Michael
Lopp, Senior Engineering Manager at
Apple, revealed at SXSW 2008 how the
Apple team spends a huge amount of
time to make ten highly realistic pic-
ture mockups, before carefully pick-
ing out just three and then spend a
few more months on them, and even-
tually picking the final winner. If this
is indeed true, it is no wonder that we
keep hearing rumours from the indus-
try about certain exciting projects, yet
never seeing them materialize (e.g. the
Mac tablet that ASUS claimed to be
helping Apple to develop).
The process doesn’t end here.
Jonathan Ive, Senior Vice President of
Industrial Design at Apple, is known
to personally make several trips to the
outsourced factories in China, making
sure that every tiny detail on the pro-
duction line are perfected to his own
high standard. Such dedication from
this Londoner sure makes us Brits
proud.
To wrap this up, one thing is for sure:
Apple is definitely working on some-
thing big in a secret warehouse as we
speak, but judging on recent product
cycles, the next big leap for the Mac-
Book will probably not be until late
2011. If you can’t wait, the iMac will
probably get a significant refresh later
this year or early next year. As for the
iPhone, I doubt there will be anything
new coming out until next summer,
but I can wait.
Or just get the Palm Pre.
It’s a waiting
game...

Marc Kerstein covers Apple’s latest WWDC keynote address
O
n Monday 8th, Apple
hosted their annual
“Worldwide Develop-
ers Conference”, or
“WWDC” for short.
Like Macworld, WWDC’s keynote
presentation has announced the re-
lease of a range of groundbreaking
hardware and software since 1996.
This year’s keynote began with the
well-received announcement of price
cuts across Apple’s notebook range.
The 13-inch aluminium MacBook saw
the welcome addition of an SD card slot
and FireWire 800, and has been added
to Apple’s MacBook Pro line. The 15-
inch MacBook Pro gained the same,
but at the cost of its ExpressCard slot.
Personally, I only used my ExpressCard
slot with an SD card adaptor, but for
those who made more use of the slot,
the 17-inch model still has it built in.
Other than the price drops across the
MacBook Pro line, significant changes
such as the backlit keyboard becom-
ing the default for the 13-inch, or the
change from the NVIDIA 9600M to
the 9400M in the 15-inch base model
have also come into effect. All Mac-
Book Pros (including the 13-inch)
now come with a non-removable bat-
tery. Although not a problem for most,
some may find this annoying. As a
compromise, however, Apple claim
that the changes to the internal struc-
ture of the machines ensure that the
larger built-in battery will last longer
on a single charge, and through 1000
charge cycles.
Next, the leader of the OS X team,
Bertrand Serlet, began the anticipated
announcement of new features in Ap-
ple’s forthcoming operating system,
OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, only after
pointing out several “unaddressed is-
sues” in Microsoft’s Windows 7. Snow
Leopard will offer many refinements
from Leopard, such as the Finder being
rewritten in Cocoa, an enhanced Ex-
posé, and the new QuickTime X. Snow
Leopard will be available this Septem-
ber, and cost just $29 to upgrade from
Leopard (UK price TBA).
The most anticipated section of the
keynote began when Scott Forstall,
Apple’s SVP for iPhone software took
the stage. After a quick recap of pre-
viously announced features for iPhone
OS 3.0 (available from June 17th), sev-
eral enthusiastic accessory and appli-
cation developers demonstrated their
upcoming products for the iPhone,
such as TomTom. The first turn-by-
turn car navigation application for the
iPhone was demonstrated, and the
TomTom employees left the stage to
great applause.
A new feature of MobileMe was also
announced. The new “Find My iPhone”
service gives MobileMe subscribers
the ability to view their iPhone’s cur-
rent location on a map. A custom
message can also be sent to the device,
along with a sound to help locate it.
More noteworthy, however, is the abil-
ity to remotely erase all data on the de-
vice if stolen or lost, a feature already
available to Microsoft Exchange users,
and a great addition to MobileMe.
At the end of the keynote, the iPhone
3G S was announced. The new features
were shown, such as a long awaited up-
grade to the camera with 3 megapixels
and autofocus, finally capable of re-
cording video. The phone also includes
a digital compass that rotates Google
Maps the correct way, and a new com-
pass application. The iPhone 3G S is
around twice as fast as the iPhone 3G,
and also has an increased battery life,
making it a great upgrade from the
iPhone 3G.
Despite being the first WWDC with
no appearance from Apple’s famous
CEO Steve Jobs, Apple presented an
extensive keynote, covering new Mac
hardware and software, along with
an aggressive upgrade to the hard-
ware and software of their dominant
iPhone, with surprisingly early release
dates, and massive price drops.
