Cancer
As the fair weather
drinkers enter the
building, you decide
the best thing to do
is remain perfectly
still. They pass you
seamlessly, and proceed to the bar. Like David
Attenborough, you observe the creatures with
wonder and awe as they attempt to purchase a
beverage. They seem confused by what is on offer
and ask the question: “What do you have on tap?”
Virgo
With all your exams
over, and nothing to
do you start to bore
quickly. After browsing
the Internet for a new
shoes, you end up using
the Internet for what it was designed for. Porn.
Mid browse you happen upon some porn of the
horse variety. Due to extreme boredom, you buy
a fine stallion (from e-bay), bring him home and
engage in some classy horse porn. It hurts. A lot.
Gemini
This week you an-
nounce to the whole
exam room that you
have had an abortion.
The hope is that you
will get extra points
as you have gone though a difficult process,
leaving you mentally scarred. People give you
funny looks and start to question your mental
health. After all you are a man, so if you were to
have an abortion... are you a transvestite?
Pisces
This week, a small
argument erupts in the
felix office (Ed: sorry,
but we want your opin-
ion!). The Deputy Edi-
tor starts to argue that
guitar solo’s are boring, they were good in the 60’s
and now they are done and you have no reason
to listen to it. Others argue that a guitar solo is
like any other classical piano or violin solo. The
Deputay disagrees, douche, what do you think?
Leo
This week you decide
that fire is really cool.
Lacking any appropri-
ate fuel, you take a
copy of felix and light
it. Being the dick that
you are, you don’t let go and you burn your hand.
Not satisfied by this, you think that lighting the
crotch part of your jeans would be a better idea,
fortunately t burns your pubes and cock off. Kids,
here’s a lesson, don’t play with fire!
Aries
This week, as every
week, you go for a few
drinks at the Union.
You sit down with
your cool pint in one
of the booths and
then you suddenly feel the earth begin to shake.
Although slightly alarmed, you maintain com-
posure and grab hold of your pint before any of
it is spilled. You look around and then you see
them... the fairweather drinkers have arrived!
Scorpio
This week you see
Lady Gaga without her
make-up. Finally those
fucking stupid glasses
and fringe make perfect
sense and you realise
that she is a BOBFOC. Seriously, her face looks
like its been attacked by a deranged elf with a
pick-axe, and then threw her off the ugly tree. It
might be an old saying, but you get the picture.
How the fuck is she famous, seriously?!?!
Libra
The barmaid looks
puzzled, yet at the
same time has a
smile on her face. She
pores them a pint of
Foster’s, tells them it’s
a Staropramen and pockets the profit. Although
this raises a smile on your face, you then realise
that the Union makes a nice profit, they get really
drunk and eventually ruin the atmosphere. This
is not acceptable, something must be done...
Taurus
This week you get
a crash course in
an eastern Euro-
pean language. This
was not, however,
achieved through
the humanities department, instead, it was
achieved through banging a girl and having her
entire family listen on speaker phone as you
do! Allow felix to kindly translate: “Get off our
daughter you little shit”. Well done sir!
Horoscopes, what happens when a bear takes coke
As the year draws to an end, I begin to look back and think- maybe the world is nice... but then I thought no

Right, I’ve decided not to lay out the crossword
at about 1 a.m. so hopefully this week’s cross-
word will not have any mistakes. Despite the
mistakes, some people still managed to do the
crossword, with Dr. Science! being the winner
this week. This is the last week to earn FUC-
WIT points, so best of luck to everyone!

Capricorn
So you get the fucker
who just burnt his cock,
throw him onto the
passed out bodies lying
across the floor. They
set alight and then you
get those fairweather drinkers who are drunk but
still standing to piss all over the rest of them to put
them out. Satisfied with your actions, you return to
the bar where a mountain of beers are waiting for
you from everyone else in the room. Pint?
Aquarius
This week you go
proper bat shit crazy.
After a particularly
stressful day you go
into Beit Quad, strip
butt naked, put your
penis between your legs and hop round shout-
ing in a high pitched voice “look at me! I’m a
ladyeeeee”. Get yourself some help son- sharp-
ish before you go so crazy you begin to find
Lady Gaga attractive.

As term draws to an
end, you look forward
to going back home to
your mummy where
you she does all your
washing, cooks for you,
and YOU SLEEP IN YOUR OWN FUCKING
ROOM. The whole of this year you have been
cooped up with a prehistoric wanker for a room-
-mate. Actually, not so much a room-mate, but a
room-cunt. Fuck you.

How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number of lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be one
continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

Again, Peter de Boeck took
all the honours here, finding
PORNFEAST hiding within
the mystical grid of letters. Big
hand chap and nice to have you
aboard. I hope you enjoy this
week’s offerings.

“The guy on the left of the centrefold,
I knew I recognised you. Why did you
run away when I went to the toilet at
the union? Ill be there on friday. x”
“Why is Ravi Pall suddenly making
sense?”
“Politicians? Democracy? Fuck that.
Wouldn’t trust those ignorant masses.
Viva dictatorship!!”
“To the guy on the 4th floor in the
library talking about his shitty phone
getting stolen. No one fucking cares,
you shouldn’t have left it on it’s own in
the cafe you stupid fuck. Now shut the
fuck up!”
“To hangman editor-biochemists have
feelings too!”
“Wow, just got to say to the bearded
guys on Library L2, I wish I could
scare a little chinese guy like you lot.
What wankers you are.

Going Underground
Well done to our newest competitor
Peter de Boeck who won this wee lit-
tle game too. The correct station was
BOND STREET, unfortunately there is
a planned walk out next week over pay
(or lack of it) so there will be no Going
Underground. Thank you all.

So which London tube station sums to 106?
This week’s Cat Phone:
_ _ _ _
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.
Mentalist Maze...
Mentalist maze is mental, that’s why we
give double points for it. That means
10 points just for scrawling a line on a
page. That can mean iPods. But it’s too
late now. Anyway, Peter de Boeck was
the winner, so thank you for bothering.
Next week may see a big fuck-off maze,
but we’ll see.

Next week we are having a fooking
ma-hoosive slitherlink, so this is the
last mini one. Whatever. It was won
by Peter de Boeck so well done. Very
proud for you.

Nonogram 1,436
How to play:
Nonograms are logic puzzles in which cells
in a grid have to be coloured or left blank ac-
cording to numbers at the side of the grid.
The numbers measure how many unbroken
lines or filled-in squares there are in any given
row or column. Look at the solution for help.
Peter de Boeck won. To be brutally honest I
am particularly bored of writing your name
over and over again. I know it’s the end of
term, but please can I have more entries to
entertain me!
