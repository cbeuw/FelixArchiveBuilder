Preserving the Madeiran landscape
through acrylic paintings
Students from Imperial join others from
London to paint the protected UNESCO
sights of Madeira
T
wenty students took part
on a World Heritage Site
trip in early February to
paint the beautiful and
protected Laurisilva For-
est in Madeira.
Between the 5th and 8th of February,
the students were taught landscape
acrylic painting (a la prima technique)
on the landscapes of Madeira by Nel-
son Ferreira. The lessons took place
all over the island, in some of the most
remote and preserved parts of the
Laurisilva forests. Once the students
returned to London, the sketches were
reworked and inspired fifty other stu-
dents to also paint the protected land-
scapes of Madeira.
Madeira is an archipelago with vol-
canic origins from a hot spot; a static
source of volcanic activity which re-
sults in multiple islands as the tectonic
plate moves over it (Ed: geologists, I’m
sure I’ve got something wrong here, but
I gave it my best shot!). Because of the
hot spot, Madeira is not geographi-
cally part of any specific continent, but
it has belonged, ethnically, culturally,
economically and politically to Portu-
gal for some 600 years.
When the original settlers landed on
the island, they set fire to the indig-
enous laurisilva subtropical rainforest
which once covered the whole island
to clear the land for farming. However,
in the north, the valleys contain native
trees of fine growth. These Lauris-
ilva forests, notably the forests on the
northern slopes of Madeira Island, are
designated a World Heritage Site by
UNESCO.
The project was supported by sev-
eral bodies, including the natural park
of Madeira, UNESCO, Casa da Cultura
de Camara de Lobos and a top art mu-
seum in Portugal – Centro das Artes
da Casa das Mudas.
Once the work was finished, the
pieces was exhibited by the two mu-
seums; Casa da Cultura de Camara de
Lobos exhibited the paintings between
4th April and 2nd May, whilst Centro
das Artes da Casa das Mudas exhib-
ited the paintings between 3rd April
and 23rd April. Nelson Ferreira com-
mented that:
“I wanted to make my students aware
of the environmental issues affect-
ing some of the most stunning places
worldwide – and the beauty of the nat-
ural landscapes of Madeira did appeal
to their artistic minds.”
“These projects have also made the
students feel more confident about
themselves and their artistic abilities
and created a bit of a buzz by show-
ing at two international art museums
and with the support of institutions as
UNESCO and the media coverage that
it generated in Portugal, which includ-
ed national newspaper articles and TV
interview.”
This is not the first “World Herit-
age Site trip” that the group have done.
Every three months they go away to
various locations to paint and have
been to such places like the historical
centre of Porto, museums in Berlin and
to Sintra.
Ferreira went on to say that:
“These frequent ‘World Heritage
Site’ visit art projects have changed
many students’ opinion on what an
ideal world should be.”
Their next trips will be to Rome in a
couple of weeks and then a trip to the
Douro Valley in September.

Queen’s Lawn to become open air
theatre for Twelfth Night
Tosin Ajayi gives a preview of DramSoc’s free show of Twelfth
Night, or What You Will to be performed on the Queen’s Lawn
T
o quote the Reduced
Shakespeare Company:
Guy A: “Which Shake-
speare comedy is the one
where there’s twins, a ship
wreck, mistaken identity and everyone
gets married?”
Guys B&C: “All of them.”
So the summer is here and in drama
circles that means outdoor Shake-
speare productions; it is as inevitable
and expected as the conclusion of one
of his comedies. There are many places
in London to catch one of these an-
nual celebrations: the Globe Theatre,
Regent’s Park open-air theatre and of
course our very own Queen’s Lawn.
Yes, in what is becoming a mini-tra-
dition, DramSoc is once again present-
ing a Shakespeare comedy. Following
on from the stately Much Ado About
Nothing last year, this year’s model is
Twelfth Night, Or What You Will; and
if the YouTube trailer is anything to
by, this is a production with its tongue
firmly in its cheek. “What”, I hear you
ask, “does this have to offer that the
Globe or Regent’s Park players can’t?”
Well, for starters it’s FREE, it’s close,
and you can bring a beer.
Starting two years ago as a result of
a half-drunken conversation during a
bar night, it was thought a good idea to
perform A Midsummer Night’s Dream
on Midsummer’s Night. The 21st June.
During exam term… riiiighhht.
Well, back then a director, produc-
tion team and cast of characters was
found crazy enough to take on learn-
ing Shakespeare in and around exams,
treating it as an escape and relaxation
technique. Two years later the immi-
nent production of Twelfth Night, Or
What You Will stands as testament to
the success of the first production.
Beyond the generic plot description
you expect with Shakespeare com-
edies, Twelfth Night is the one where
the twins – Sebastian and Viola: one
male, one female – get shipwrecked on
the shore of a foreign country. Believ-
ing her brother to be dead, Viola de-
cides to disguise herself as a man called
Caesario (as you do) and work for the
local Duke, Orsino. He in turn is be-
sotted with a local noble woman, Ol-
ivia, who ignores his – and any man’s
– advances as she is still in mourn-
ing for her dead brother and father...
(Deep breath)... Orsino sends Caesario
to woo Olivia on his behalf and Olivia
falls head over heels in love with him/
her. All this is further complicated by
the fact that Viola is beginning to get
romantic stirrings for her boss, Orsino.
Got that? Good. Chuck in the possibil-
ity of someone who looks exactly like
her/him still walking around, a butler
with some particularly garish clothing
and a couple of drunk troublemakers,
and you have hilarity on a stick – and
the language doesn’t even stand in the
way!
Why Shakespeare again? Well, we
searched high and low for an alter-
native, something different, but as
explained above, there is a certain
inevitability about Shakespeare and
summer. No matter what you do, you
come back to it. As a matter of fact,
we challenge anyone to come up with
something that works outdoors (with
a good distribution of parts so that no
one fails exams) as well as Shakespeare
does.
Seeing as the previous two produc-
tions have occurred in the final week
of the academic year, they have the
quite welcome side-effect of round-
ing off the year and the #@!*ing exam
period. Previous audience members
commented on how great it was to sit,
chill, watch a show and get rid of mur-
derous thoughts of lecturers who have
shafted you by setting questions that
had nothing to do with the course they
‘taught’. All-in-all, a vital service to the
student populace, and even more so to
lecturers.
With all this in the pot, it is a great
time to prove to the uneducated, and
reaffirm to the conversant, that Shake-
speare is:
a) Understandable
b) Accessible
c) FUNNY!!!
May you kick the ass of every exam,
and hope to see you on the Queen’s
Lawn.
DramSoc perform Twelfth Night,
Or What You Will on Sunday 21st
June at 14:00 and Thursday 25th
June at 18:00 and 21:30.
