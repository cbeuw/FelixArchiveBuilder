L
ast Thursday, I was fortu-
nate to meet Sir David At-
tenborough, that giant of
the documentary world.
He was signing books in
the Waterstone’s on High Street Ken-
sington and this was an opportunity I
wasn’t going to pass up. Besides, it was
either that, or reams upon reams of re-
vision hidden away in my room like an
ascetic with agoraphobia.
Even though I was only with the
famed naturalist for a few seconds,
I was suitably impressed. Dressed
smartly in a cream jacket, he warmly
asked me how I was as he opened my
copy of his autobiography (Life on
Air, available in all good bookstores).
Dressed in a Hawaiian shirt of ques-
tionable taste, I don’t think I quite ex-
pressed the same level of eloquence.
I guess I was just awestruck; this was
the voice who had unveiled the natu-
ral world to me, who had slaked my
curiosity and stoked my interest in
nature and all things green. I suppose,
in a round-about way, he is one of the
reasons I am at Imperial today. Pen
down, he handed his book back to me.
I thanked him and walked off with an
air of particular gormlessness.
As fascinating albeit brief encounter
as that was, it is but the springboard to
my main topic this week. Before I even
got to meet Dave (I like to think we’re
on first name terms now – even though
he dedicated the book to Gerald), I had
to wait in line for a good hour or so.
But this gave me the perfect chance to
participate in that great British past-
time, the Queue.
The Queue is ubiquitous in modern
society. Where there are people, there
will certainly be queues; this is truth.
Be it pale and spotty video-gamers
waiting outside the electronics store in
the dead of night for the latest console
release, or the unemployed queueing
up outside the job centre, or the poor-
est of the poor in the third world wait-
ing expectantly as aid is delivered and
distributed, there is no one who does
not know the experience that is the
queue.
And it has its own rules and eti-
quette, not all of which are necessarily
obeyed, but quietly respected in their
own way. Consider, you have to stand
in a line, surrounded by strangers on
either side, all for the same common
goal. Normally, we are distrustful crea-
tures, casting suspicious glances at
anyone within a three metre radius.
But line us up in a queue and every-
thing changes. Even though our per-
sonal space shrinks down to zero, we
become amiable, even affable.
Now, I will admit, the weather was
favourable to me for once. I got to bask
in the warm glow of late afternoon
sunshine, proper summer weather.
It would have been perfect if I hadn’t
been missing the Pimms. What’s more,
this was the first time I had been out
of the halls in days. After the pains of
immunoglobulins, anastomoses and
pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, I
was glad to be reminded what fresh (by
London’s standards) air smelt like.
But even if it had been raining, lash-
ing it down in biblical proportions, I
argue it would still have been a jolly
old time. I recall childhood trips to
Disneyland Paris, queueing for Space
Mountain in a continental downpour,
protected by only a sheet of plastic
with Mickey Mouse emblazoned on
the back. Ah, plastic anoraks.
In spite of the weather, or perhaps
even because of it, my family and I
would strike up conversation with our
neighbours in the line. With nothing
else to do, without even the weath-
er to enjoy, we talked, we joked, we
laughed...we realised we didn’t speak
German and they didn’t speak English,
but we had a good time. It is in the
queue that we can branch out and con-
nect with other people. Friendships are
made, bonds are formed and I think
perhaps humanity has its good points
after all.
Maybe it was the beautiful weather
buoying our spirits but there was a
convivial atmosphere in that line. I
saw old men, out in their socks and
sandals, standing next to mere boys,
still dressed in their school blazers. I
saw businessmen, I saw students; all
of them deeply engaged in the opening
chapters of Sir David’s autobiography.
They say London is the great melting
pot of peoples, cultures, ideas. I put
this down to the power of the Queue.
Waiting for a bus. Standing on an Un-
derground station platform. Queueing
for a gig of some shape or form. Does
any other city force us to wait as much
as London? But it is a good thing that
it does. In our hectic, busy lives, when
we are all in a rush, a queue forces us to
stop, wait, and have patience. Instead
of neurotic balls of rage and anxiety, we
can take a deep breath, take a look at
those around us, and realise that we’re
human. To be human is to wait, to wait
is to have hope. Hope that the Picca-
dilly line is running on time.
...but if you cut in front of me, I swear
I’ll shank your ass!
Rhys Davies hates queues, but he did meet Dave!

Sanjay Choolun just can’t seem to get to sleep
I
t’s 5.41am. I’ve tried reading a
few chapters of a textbook, limp-
ly shuffled a few things around
on my desk and have gone to the
bathroom just for the trip. This
would be pretty unusual behaviour if it
wasn’t the sixth night in a row.
My problem, as you may have al-
ready guessed, is insomnia. My reason
is exam-related stress.
Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not one
of those kids who’s aced every single
test since nursery and then throws a
self-pitying fit whenever any form of
assessment comes their way. Nor am I
not fond of sleep. I love sleep. Ask any-
one where I am before noon on a week-
day and it would be a safe bet it’s under
the covers catching some shuteye. Too
bad all that time in bed and not enough
in lectures is coming round to bite me
in the ass.
What happens is this: as soon as I
lie down, my mind starts to whirr. “If
I was up I could read another section”,
or, “I still have a Lab report”, and more
leisurely, “I need to sort out my holi-
day plans ASAP”... If I let it carry on I
feel my throat starting to close. I toss
and turn and think of Zen but noth-
ing clears my mind. At best I can get
an hour of sleep before I awake with a
start. Somehow I don’t think counting
sheep is the answer.
Inevitably I decide to get up, take a
shower and begin my day. And do you
know what the kicker is? By 10am I am
completely dead to the world and faced
with a new dilemma: do I sleep now
and risk not sleeping at night, or do I
try my best to endure extreme sleep
deprivation? I believe the answer is un-
important, you’re screwed both ways.
I’m sure you, dear reader, know the
benefits of good sleep. It rejuvenates
your body and mind, giving you energy
and improving mental focus. Accord-
ing to those science-y types, is also vi-
tal to a healthy immune system. Ah, so
that explains my constant headaches,
sore throats and poor sexual perform-
ance. Well, I hope so.
But how can such a laid-back, care-
free, all-around-Cool-Dude like me get
something as pussy as anxiety? Person-
ally, I put it down to the “You’re Fucked
Now” lecture a month ago, where they
were keen to emphasise that 40% or
less and at best it ruins your summer,
at worse it ruins your degree. This is
including scaling of results, a depart-
mental policy against all forms of an-
swers or mark schemes and a record
sized year group that is prime for some
Darwinistic pruning. So no pressure
then.
Sadly enough, after speaking to a few
compadres, it seems I am not the only
one going through this. The best any of
us can hope for is to suck up enough
knowledge come exam time and then
hopefully fall into a still, soothing
slumber. It makes me wonder just how
many people are essentially failed by a
lack of support system and aggressive
education policies. Are you up in the
wee hours reading this article right
now? Is your bed lying sullen and un-
used like the Sherfield oriental buffet?
Are you looking at a pile of textbooks
and getting angry at the bullshit that
lies ahead of you?
Don’t worry about it, friend. My ad-
vice to you? Sleep on it.

I
t’s the last year of my degree,
my exams are over and I’m
one month away from sever-
ing all contact with what most
people would call an alma
mater, but I prefer to think of as my
mater horribilis. That would be a bit
of a shame, I thought, so I thought
I’d leave a record for posterity. Give
something back to the birthplace
of my learning. Provide a tender,
guiding and increasingly disturbing
hand for young freshers just like me,
when I had my honour, when I had
my dreams, and before I learnt the
alternative use of hall of residence
sinks. What would that be? It’s the
Real Rules of Imperial!
Real Rules? Now you might say
that we already have a Student Sur-
vival Guide.
• Rule #1: The Student Survival
Guide is wrong.
• Rule #2: Except the bad bits,
which are right.
Those are the two fundamental
Real Rules of Imperial! Each of the
following Rules was learnt through
seconds, minutes, sometimes even
hours of soul-breaking perspiration
in the dark corridors, cramped lec-
ture theatres and stifling computer
labs of this most excellent institu-
tion. I hope you have as much pleas-
ure reading them as pain I had learn-
ing them. So, in no particular order,
with naturally complete sincerity,
and with all the fanfare of another
empty night at dB’s… The Real Rules
of Imperial!
• Imperial offers a rounded educa-
tion. They teach both integration and
differentiation.
• Don’t bother revising. It only mat-
ters once a year, just before you enter
the exam hall.
• Reading your exam questions after
the exam does gain marks. That’s why
everybody does it!
• Packed lunches are optional. You
already have enough reasons not to eat
college food.
• “He who do no past papers like he
who write 2009 Advanced Classical
Physics paper. He relish human suffer-
ing.” - Confucius
• That lame night at the Union was
not a fluke. Neither were the twenty-
three previous.
• In first year, you despise the medics.
In second year, you date the medics.
• Why are you still reading those
exam questions after the exam? For
crying out loud, man, it’s midnight and
you haven’t eaten. Lose any more brain
cells and you’ll end up in LCF!
• “It’s not r*pe if you shout surprise!”
– or you’re drunk.
• In the Standard Model, Imperial
girls are theorised to exist in six fla-
vours of increasing mass: up, down,
charm, strange, bottom and top. Of
these the fourth is disproportionately
the most naturally abundant, and the
third has a boyfriend from UCL.
• In the Standard Model, Imperial
boys come in two flavours: overcom-
pensating and overcompensating.
• lol someone drew a cock on your
notes!
• Oh my days. Not only do you still
have your exam paper, but you’ve pen-
cilled in next to each question how
many marks you think you’ve got!
• Imperial House Parties: All the
mess of normal house parties, without
the excitement!
• No one who crammed to get in
Imperial will stay in Imperial. No one
who doesn’t cram in Imperial will stay
in Imperial.
• So… that’s a maximum of 70 marks
you got, because you didn’t answer 30.
Let’s say you dropped 20 of those. 50
marks at least! Two months later, you
find out you failed.
• Everybody loves an Asian girl. All
right, it’s IC and we have to be numeri-
cal about everything. All 273 members
of your faculty love an Asian girl, and
not all of them are male.
• You justify not revising by arguing
that you will have enough time if you
travel close to the speed of light.
• A kitten dies every time you don’t
fill out SOLE. A lecturer dies inside
every time you do fill out SOLE.
• “To see rector, become rich alum-
nus.” - Confucius
• The less relatively qualified the
catering staff are, the more they look
down on you.
• Just as man and woman exist to fill
each other’s needs, so other univer-
sity’s campuses fill the needs of our
students.
• Internal dialogue: “To get a job, I
need experience. Oh, I have no experi-
ence. So to get experience I need a job.
But I don’t have a job! How do I get a
job? I need experience. But I have no
experience. So to get experience I need
a…”
• Imperial Student Nights: Now fea-
turing over 12,000 highly qualified ac-
ademically successful mathematically
numerate engineering students!
• For every airhead thou shalt find
ten pricks, and for every prick thou
shalt find ten geeks talking about what
is not on the syllabus.
• lol I drew on your face when you
were asleep!
• The Senior Common Room is
strictly for the use of staff, lecturers,
visitors, postgraduates, and under-
graduates who have given up on the
Junior Common Room.
• You pretend that exam was a disas-
ter to avoid having your neck snapped
by the post-exam-lynch-mob.
• Your Welcome Pack will contain
two condoms. These are best used as
water balloons.
• Nerdy chat up lines are, like, totally
worth a shot. I mean I have nothing to
lose right… my dignity?
• Hall seniors are not permitted to
nail the freshers and get caught.
• Thou shalt not laugh at Physics
jokes beyond Queen’s Gate.
• We’re actually better than Ox-
bridge. It’s because we don’t waste time
on social events.
• Lots of people get firsts without
working at all. They just do their de-
grees in playtime.
• I think I saw Brian May in the Phys-
ics lifts!
• You take Physics. You find out why
Boltzmann killed himself.
• You see the beauty in mathemat-
ics: a big behind, okay mouth, not
sure about the eyes…
• “Oh, my gosh. Yes! Yes! YES!!
More! I didn’t realise the human
body was capable of such exquisite
pleasure!” Let’s hear it people. “We-
bCT ISN’T BREAKING TODAY!”
• One of my lecturers has got
sweat problems and a monobrow. I
feel better. I need to see him more
• “He who cite Wikipedia like Ron-
seal One Coat Tile Paint: no marks.”
- Confucius
• Lock all doors and bin all con-
doms before a house party.
• If all else fails, master the art of
timely entrances.
• You take pleasure in hearing
freshers despair about topics you
covered fully eight terms ago.
• First, you try reading all the rec-
ommended textbooks, but you run
out of time and get a 2:2. Then, you
highlighting your notes and doing
the problem sheets, but you can’t do
them. You get a 3rd. You try doing
the past exam papers, but the real
exam bears as much resemblance to
them as your GCSE Modern Greek
paper. You fail. Finally, your exam
strategy becomes “I’ve got dimen-
sional analysis and I’m not afraid to
use it.”

Hard, Stay Hard.”

BARELOLS over and out!
C
az Knight is really open-
minded. Seriously. Just
look at how in last week’s
comment article – “Love
versus atheism?” – she
considers the problem of how athe-
ists can account for love. See how she
considers the atheist view of love? No-
tice how she doesn’t label atheists with
negative words like “hardcore” and
“nihilistic”? Marvel at how she doesn’t
write off the view that love is down to
some biological mechanism as a “dis-
Barnaby Walker:
Caz Knight versus
open-minds?
The Real Rules of Imperial by BARELOLS
I
am an atheist, and yet I feel love.
I care about my friends and my
family, I feel happy when they’re
happy and sad when they’re
sad. However, according to Caz
Knight’s last week article, I shouldn’t.
Apparently, not believing in a deity
gives me no purpose in anything and
doesn’t allow me to even get up in the
morning, because I am a soulless man
whose only aim is to produce offspring.
I think Caz Knight confuses evolu-
tion with atheism. The two are separate
theories in separate fields of human
knowledge. Those who don’t believe
in God don’t shape their lives to fol-
low the principles of evolution. Rather,
they decide to live in a world free of su-
pernatural elements where choices are
dictated by reason and critical thinking
rather than superstition and dogma.
Atheism does not give a goal, or an aim
to life. It is simply a way of approach-
ing the world and the others that tries
to be as fair and free from prejudice as
possible. In no way is evolution linked
to this. A scientific theory tries to ex-
plain the world; it does not aim to be
a guide like a philosophic thought
would. Equating the two shows great
confusion about what atheists really
believe in, and render any conclusions
drawn from this rather useless.
Under a certain point of view, love is
a very evolutionary idea: caring for our
mates strengthens us and the commu-
nity, increasing the chances of viable
offspring to perpetuate the species;
however that is not the point. There
are a lot of things on how our brain
works that we do not know, but this
does not mean that we cannot obtain
complete knowledge without resort-
ing to the supernatural. Hormones and
other biochemical explanations reveal
part of the picture, and imputing the
unknowns to religion and God is a lazy
and closed-minded way to settle the is-
sue. Or, alternatively, it is an overzeal-
ous and pointless exercise of finding a
meaning where none is. Like Douglas
Adams said, isn’t it enough to see that
a garden is beautiful without having to
believe that there are fairies at the bot-
tom of it too? Why can’t you enjoy love
without having to think that it’s part of
something profound and special? Isn’t
the pleasure that you get from being
with people you care about enough for
you? Why do you have to try to graft
onto it something else, with the poor
excuse that it would prove the exist-
ence of God?
I don’t need a “purpose” to drive me
when I wake up in the morning. There’s
no master plan, visible or invisible, that
drives me. Sure, there are goals I would
like to achieve, but I don’t allow them
to dictate my life. I don’t help a friend
in need because I am earning the king-
dom of Heaven; I help my friend be-
cause he needs my aid.
I don’t steal not because I fear pun-
ishment (mortal and divine) if caught,
but because it is a bad thing to do.
Seeking a reason to be good and enjoy
life is redundant and it can prevent you
from doing it fully.
Life and love are an end in them-
selves. Forgive my cheesiness, but they
are all about the journey, and not the
destination. Saying that atheists find
love dismal and futile because it has no
evolutionary advantage is profoundly
wrong. Every man or woman will
feel good when embracing a person
they care about, and atheists make no
difference.
If you want to believe that it is be-
cause a supernatural being ordered
you to, be my guest; but please do not
claim that because I don’t, I’m incapa-
ble of love.
Caz Knight’s comment piece
takes another hit, this time
from Pietro Aronica
mal and futile one”?
Sorry. I was joking. The actual ar-
ticle is just one close-minded state-
ment after another, sprinkled with the
odd straw man or ad-hominem attack
on Richard Dawkins. Now really Caz,
do you have to say such un-Christian
things about the man’s marriage? Does
it really a bearing on the issue at hand?
What would Pope Benedict XVI say?
I’m not too sure, but I have a feel-
ing he would say something along the
lines of your second paragraph being
the biggest straw man since the Wicker
Man. You know the part where you im-
plicitly align all atheists with the view
of biological determinism? It’s hardly
fair. Not all of us believe our morals or
feelings can be reduced to a complex
chain of chemical reactions. Maybe
you should make like Nicolas Cage and
be burned inside your carefully made
straw man. You don’t deserve to be Ed-
ward Woodward.
But in all seriousness, there is a ques-
tion somewhere among the shambles
of an article that deserves an answer.
The question of whether humans can
live a meaningful life – of which many
would consider love a part – without a
purpose provided by some ideal such
as God is very poignant. It’s something
that’s put more eloquently in Jean-Paul
Sartre’s ‘Existentialism is a Human-
ism’, where he notes a Catholic critic’s
comment that “we forget how an infant
smiles”.
What this critic and Caz Knight seem
to be missing in their close-minded-
ness is that there can be beauty and
meaning without God. For someone
like Richard Dawkins, that beauty may
be in seeing the complex chain of bio-
logical determinism behind each and
every action, a biology that unites eve-
ry human being. For me, this beauty is
in the life-affirming freedom given to
humans without a God, a freedom to
do whatever I choose and to create my
own essence. For atheists, life can be
beautiful. Unlike Caz Knight’s article.
