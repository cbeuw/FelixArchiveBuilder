Olympic rugby –
only a dream?
A grassroots petition seems to have
become the most important resource
to get rugby recognised as a sport
played at the Olympics.
Imagine rugby at the antique Olym-
pic Games way back in 300 BC. Back
then the Greek Gods were calling the
shots; wouldn’t they have just loved the
sport? How about the Trojans taking
on the Spartans who would no doubt
have dominated the tournament, with
Ares, the God of War, at open side
flank, Zeus, the God of Thunder, at
inside center and Athena, the Goddess
of strategic battle and wisdom, as their
head coach!?
It’s about time rugby returned to the
great heights of Olympos, the famous
mountain that was the ‘home of the
Gods’ in ancient Greek mythology.
The International Olympic Commit-
tee is meeting in a few weeks to discuss
potential new sports to be included.
In October a decision on the Olym-
pic Sports Programme for 2016 will
be made at a meeting in Copenhagen
- there are two vacant slots. Rugby is
competing with several other sports
which include karate, golf and squash.
Max Joachim In 2005, rugby’s bid to get back into the
[2012] Olympics – the last time it was,
being in 1924 – failed in 2005 but this
time it has got the support from people
all over the world.
olympic-rugby.org is a grass-roots,
rugby players’ initiative that will try to
collect millions of signatures for the
Olympic rugby cause through media
stunts and viral action (Ed - Hopefully
the sort of viral action which doesn’t
lead to a worsening of the swine flu
pandemic). They have already gath-
ered the support from the best sevens
rugby nations in the world includ-
ing England, New Zealand and world
champions Wales. This week, they
started the Olympic toga campaign –
put on a bed sheet, put some leaves
on your head and dress as an ancient
Greek. Sevens rugby is a spectacular,
high scoring, fast-paced, exciting and
an easy to understand game that will
be a gateway for all forms of rugby to
experience growth and large interna-
tional support. No doubt, sevens and
the fan culture will add a lot of charac-
ter and colour to the Games.
Now you have a chance to make Ol-
ympic history! Engage! Go to olympic-
rugby.org and add your signature.

I
am sick and tired of people hav-
ing nothing better or construc-
tive to ask besides “where do
you live?”
No I am not talking about a
conversation with someone from the
BNP security detail but if you’re still
confused then I ask any football (soc-
cer) fan to go to our godforsaken union
or any other public house which show
football matches.
Not long ago I did this and partway
through the game after the team I sup-
port happened to score I was asked by
a random fan the question I highlight-
ed earlier. “But that is nowhere near”
the home stadium of where my team of
choice play, he replied. “So?” I retorted
and we went back and forth before he
was satisfied (pause) that I was a real
supporter of the club. This only seems
to happen with football and more often
than not these interrogators are phil-

istines when actually discussing the
beautiful game. On a different occa-
sion after receiving a similar barrage of
questions, I overheard this particular
person spout some of the most ridicu-
lous things heard from a fellow fol-
lower of football. “Why didn’t he pass
the ball forward? He’s shit” after an at-
tacking midfielder laid it of to a winger
who crossed the ball which resulted in
a corner. Or “he’s miles onside” whilst
the replay showed that you could have
an IQ of a knat and have seen he was
4 yards offside, without needing to see
the replay.
Perhaps he was an American foot-
ball commentator in disguise but this
happens all too often for this to be the
case.
Though I digress. Addressing the
point at hand, football is arguably the
most global sport bar athletics (track
and field). It certainly is the most glo-
balised in terms of attracting mon-
ey and the diversity of its fan base.
Clubs such as the European stalwarts
Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester
United and AC Milan have more fans
outside their respective countries than
in. Are these fans not allowed to sup-
port them because they in Spain, UK
or Italy?
Saying that there is a serious issue
regarding the biggest scourge of the
footballing community after the hooli-
gan and that is the glory hunter, but I
have found that these people are sup-
porting teams who have recently come
into some money. Pre-2004 I knew one
Chelsea supporter (and I am from West
London) but after the ‘Special One’
José Mourinho put the £150 million or
so of Roman Abramovichs money to
good use there was a massive influx of
supporters of The Blues. This disgust-
ed me as I am unsure as to who they
supported before but I predict that in a
few years Manchester City will receive
similar success in attracting such fickle
fans. Meanwhile Real Madrid will soon
have more fans than the population of
China and thus will become the next
economic superpower.
In other news, after finally reading
the list of ACC Colours recipients, I
am again disgusted. Apparently they
are awarded to people who have shone
amongst their peers but I have not
seen a bigger celebration of medioc-
rity in my life. Firstly I congratulate
you for receiving colours etcetera you
have worked hard but one just needs to
look at our felix sport table and some
of the recipients of colours and then go
figure.
And treasurer of the year? This isn’t
the Imperial College beancounting
awards.
