Where’s Will
Smith at?
W
ell I’ve only got
a tiny space this
week, but I’ve got
to get this little bit
of condescending
preaching off my chest: with regards to
the greatest summer hip-hop tracks in
the history of the universe, Will Smith
and long-time companion DJ Jazzy
Jeff’s sublime, hot-weather booty-
shaker Summertime has got to be up
there with the greatest. It is unfortu-
nate however that this seems to be the
only DJ Jazzy Jeff tune which has ever
seen the light of mainstream day. Only
recently did I discover that rather than
simply playing the fall-guy in The Fresh
Prince of Bel Air and being repeatedly
ejected from the famed West Philadel-
phia household by Uncle Phil for vari-
ous youthful misdemeanours, he is ac-
tually a real-life professional musician
with real-life professional funky-fresh
beats. I urge you all to check out his re-
leases The Magnificent and The Return
of the Magnificent for all of your sum-
mertime block-party requirements.
With exam season coming to an end
and illegal BBQ in Hyde Park season
starting up in earnest, now more than
ever is the perfect time to take heed of
my great opinions.
Fresh Rancid Album
After like a billion years, Rancid have returned from punk-
rock gereatricity with a new release. Ushnish Banerjee reports
Northern California-based ska punk
four-some Rancid return with a new
studio album Let the Dominoes Fall,
nearly six years after their last release
Indestructible in 2003. The highly an-
ticipated release is finally seeing the
light of day after two major delays in
the writing process, as major State-
side and European tours over the past
four years always seemed to hint at
imminent release dates which never
came. However, fans will discover that
the long wait for fresh songs has not
been in vain as the band seem to ex-
hibit a new and rejuvenated spirit with
this new batch of
songs produced
by Rancid’s
self-professed
‘fifth-member’
Brett Gure-
witz. Start-
ing off with
the infec-
tiously light-
hearted ‘East
bay night’,
the inception
sets the tone
for the
sing-
along and anthemic aura of the album.
Songs like ‘Up to No Good’ still refer-
ence Rancid’s ska, reggae and two-tone
influences like Desmond Decker and
Booker T (who happened to contrib-
ute to the album) in easy listeners and
heavily groove based tracks that could
get any spliff-laden dancefloor moving
with ease. ‘Last One to Die’ is a stand-
out track: a strong statement from the
band regarding the faith they have in
the longevity and timelessness of their
music in the face of skeptics and the ev-
er-changing landscape of music. Songs
like ‘Disconnected’ and ‘Liberty and
Freedom’ continue much in the vein
of the politically-motivated thematic
grounds as their previous records, by
poignantly speaking out against the
injustices faced by the average work-
ing-class American. Rancid are one
of the few punk bands to successfully
combine hook-laden musical gems
with intelligent lyrical wizardry in one
powerful formula for breeding great
sounding songs with intelligent lyrics.
Songs like ‘New Orleans’ and ‘High-
way’ are simple and down-to-earth in
their arrangements and address life on
the road and the almost school-boy
innocence of wanting to make music
with your friends. Rancid have al-
ways held that strange and
enviable power of writing
songs which evoke a feel-
ing of community and
brotherhood amongst
the listeners and they
will most likely be
successful in main-
taining this special
connection

with their fans with this album.
Considering that the majority of
these songs were written in an acous-
tic format and then converted to a
plugged format means that they all
possess a great raw vibe and if you lis-
ten with that in mind you can almost
deconstruct the songs to what might
have been their skeletal acoustic tem-
plates. This album is not powerful
because of innovation or for breaking
new creative grounds, as it does not. It
is powerful because it is an honest, raw
and humble record made by a bunch of
guys who have rekindled their
desire to make music
again.

laden musical
gems with

Marco Carola’s roots in techno go back
the best part of two decades and a
quick glance at the size of his discog-
raphy shows his prominence up to this
day. However, it’s not his production
talents that make him stand out, it’s his
ability to play great tunes for hours on
end. Some may call it mundane mini-
mal, but his rare talent of cutting music
up into a relentless groove, keeps the
dance-floor bouncing all night long.
The man from Naples graced Fabric
with his presence last Saturday and the
Italians were out in force. Taking over
the ones and twos at four in the morn-
ing, he had a bit of a task trying to re-
awaken the crowd, as the warm-up of
heavy electro was not really what the
people had come to hear. Two minutes
after taking over, the place was packed
out – everywhere
you looked,
people
were lov-
ing it.
There are
not many DJs in the world that can play
five-hour sets and keep the energy go-
ing throughout. Imagine trying to see
Pendulum keep a dance-floor filled for
five hours straight, an event that could
only ever happen if they branched out
from their monotonous 10-track rep-
ertoire that everyone seems to love so
much.
So for all you people out there who
have yet to hit Fabric on a Saturday, all
I can say is DO IT. Every Friday they
have the same DJs, and lets face it eve-
ry drum and bass / electro / dubstep
DJ has exactly the same record box and
plays pretty much the same set as eve-
ryone else on the bill. Saturdays line-
ups may look pretty empty, but if you
notice who they get, Ricardo Villalo-
bos, Chris Leibing and Marc Haule, to
name but a few, you realise that, sure,
you only see one big DJ in a night, but
these guys offer something different
week-in week-out. Saturdays offer a
better night all-round than seeing the
Scratch Perverts or Crookers who al-
ways play the same set or even worse,
have a whole box of tunes that sound
exactly the same (especially true for
the latter). So for once, give up Fri-
days, where you will spend
the whole night being
grinded by a sweaty
chav and check out a
Saturday where the
mood is definitely
more chilled and
the beats are
definitely
better.

Best bits: Amazing Value. A
good alternative for the Summer
Ball Dinner!
Worst bits: Saving up requires
patience but is well worth it.
Price: £18 per head plus service
W
hile it is true that
some people are
losing their jobs,
others are moving
into negative equi-
ty and we are destined for at least four
years of a Conservative government
who’ll (probably) round up the poor
and put them on dynamo connected
bicycles to provide green energy to
power the bourgeois, I must admit the
credit crunch isn’t all bad. As the high
earners have had their bonuses re-
duced and expense accounts are gen-
erally not quite so abused as they once
were, no-one is eating out for lunch.
Consequently, some outrageous deals
are to be had between noon and 2:30.
You can get the best food and the best
service in the country for less than half
the price it would cost otherwise. You
may not have the delights of fillet steak
or turbot on the menu, but I’d easily
sacrifice these for ox-cheek and good
fresh mackerel anyway.
A case in point is Launceston Place
(5 mins west from Imperial College).
For the meagre sum of £18+service,
we enjoyed a three course menu with
two interjections : amuse bouche and
a pre-dessert. In light of its chef’s cur-
rent (deserved) celebrity courtesy of
the Great British Menu, this must
surely the best value meal in the coun-
try. Even students can afford this: it’s
the only six or seven trips to the Sand-
wich Shop after all.
The interior had changed since I was
last there. It used to be decked out like
a series of miniature interconnected
drawing rooms, with books on man-
tlepieces and richly coloured wooden
furniture. Now it is all sleek black and
white, no doubt to better frame its
Modern European food. The mainte-
nance of the cubby hole style layout re-
mains one of its selling points ,though.
It means that even if the restaurant is
otherwise empty, you don’t need to feel
like you are rattling about in a huge hall
where the staff are listening to your
every word.
The richest macchiato of cauli-
flower and truffle oil constituted the
amuse bouche. The starters were hard
to fault. Pea and ham soup enjoyed a
smoky overtone courtesy of the home-
smoked ham from which the stock for
the soup was made.
A slow cooked duck egg covered in
truffle shavings was a deliciously per-
fumed ooze. My dish was a scallop
which had been opened, dressed with
spring onions and a light sauce and
then reclosed with puff pastry. One
opens it at the table with a quick twist
of a knife, adding a wonderful piece of
theatre to what might possibly have
been described as a slightly too subtle
dish.
Sandwich shop can wait
David Stewart visits our local celebrity chef, Tristan Welch
One reason to come here is that they haven’t called their ‘credit crunch’ menu “Credit Crunch Munch
Lunch”. Thank God. They should have named the economic downturn “Credit Orange” so none of these
rhyming atrocities could have occurred.
In the main courses, the beef was eas-
ily the worst dish. While the meat had
been slow-cooked to a mound of per-
fect cascading ribbons, the sauce and
accompanying roasted tomatoes had
more in common with pizza topping
and canned breakfast accoutrements.
The best main (which was remarkably
familiar, being the chef’s competitor’s
dish from the Great British Menu!)
was a posh fish-finger served with peas
and tartare sauce. A T-bone pork chop
sat, in terms of quality, somewhere be-
tween these two.
The famous soft-scoop ice-cream
from the programme appeared as a
pre-dessert, livened up with a gingery
syrup at the bottom. Of the deserts, an
apple pie for two could not have been
more calorific or delicious, while Eton
Mess was fine.
The chef needs more consistency
with the dishes perhaps, but there is
no doubting that at an average of four
pounds per course, this food is being
given away.

I think I need
some more cider
T
he summer is a slightly
non-sensical time where
no one is really sure what
is actually happening when
or where. The days are
slowly becoming longer and time aware-
ness is dissipating faster than al-fresco
diners are lining up the streets of fashi-
noable Chelsea eateries for fancy events.
As far as gastronomic summer events
go though, there is one whose scent
has never escaped my foodie radar.
Every year Regents Park plays host to
a most magnificent of events – The
Taste of London.
Despite the flowing champagne
and Pimm’s, Taste is not merely an
excuse to drink to oblivion. The
event takes food and its entire in-
dustry very seriously and wants you
to do the same. Stalls from London’s
best restaurants dot the Park and
you are hypnotised by the aromas
gracefully eminating from each of
them. Anyone who is anyone of rel-
evance to the world of cuisine (From
Gordon Ramsay to Tom Aikens) has
shop set up at the event. I do not
believe this a self-promotion event
however. I’d rather see it as passion-
ate people trying to pass on some of
their ideas onto the general public.
Most of these restaurants do not
necessarily need the (extra) public-
ity, but have come together with oth-
ers in the field to provide you with
an evening, that if properly taken ad-
vantage of, you shan’t forget.
It isn’t all about the restaurants.
Some of the world’s best suppliers
and most innovative food companies
are there to showcase exactly what
they have in the pipeline. There is
no lack of producers selling award-
winning wines and spirits at heavily
discounted prices. The day is not all
about capitalism though. Great ef-
fort has been made to turn this event
into a small educational symposium
where you are able to learn about an-
ything from wine and champagne to
seafood in the proper way; by tasting
and hearing from the experts. I gen-
uinely recommend the event despite
its somewhat hefty entrance price.

On another note, this week I have
what I believe to be a great treat in store
for you guys. We are lucky enough that
one of my closest friends, Marta Bobić
has provided us with a brilliantly written
review of Albion Caffe, a little, but hon-
est East London joint. Marta is not only a
fantastic writer, but also (and I have had
plenty of proof of this in the five blissful
years I have known her) an outstanding
chef. She is not merely a cook, for her
recipes are more often than not, her very
own. They tend to have this je-ne-sais-
quoi about them. It is usually in the form
of a completely unexpected ingredient
that serendipitously blends with every-
thing else in perfect harmony, or simply
a spark of genius in conceptualising what
your taste buds most love and need. She
has the gift of taking the simplest of sal-
ads or sandwiches and adapting them
into an eating experience that is quite
sincerely, out of this world.
Despite not being an Imperial student,
I think we can expect many more recipes
from her over the course of next year. .
On a more Imperialy note, I do hope
your exams have gone well and you have
had a great term. Expect a very interest-
ing issue next week. Until then, loyal
foodies.
Peach and
Tomato Summer
Salad
“I thought I would start with salads as it’s that time
of year. I purposely didn’t put quantities in them,
as I think I like the idea of people adapting them to
their own tastes and experimenting” – MB
Slice a few ripe peaches and a roughly equal amount of good, ripe
tennis-ball sized tomatoes (plum or golden heirloom are best) into
semi-circles, add wafer-thin slices of red onion and a handful of
chopped parsley. Toss with olive oil, red wine vinegar, honey, salt
and pepper.
