Imperial College Union hits
back at humanities cuts
LOLCATZ
OF
TEH
WEEK
The Union Council last night dis-
cussed plans to submit a new report
to Senate, suggesting that humanities
subjects should be saved.
Monday’s meeting of the Impe-
rial College Union Council began
with a discussion about the Humani-
ties Review. It was attended by two
members of staff from the humanities
department.
Deputy President (Education & Wel-
fare), Hannah Theodorou, said that
although there were concerns about
the other humanities cuts - including
Modern Literature and Drama and
Music in Western Civilisation - it was
languages courses that students had
been more vocal about.
The first suggestion made by Coun-
cil was to keep Japanese, the second-
most subscribed course at Imperial
with 202 students enrolled, to the level
that it is currently taught. Addressing
the concerns of some academics that
lower level languages are not worthy of
credit within an undergraduate degree,
Council recommended that Levels 1
and 2 of each language should count
for credit in all but the final year of a
degree.
ACC Chair, Sam Furse, put forward
the proposition that it was more im-
portant to save languages such as Ara-
bic, Japanese, Chinese and Russian
which students would find more diffi-
cult to learn themselves through books
and other resources. This was strongly
contested by the DPEW, as well as SCC
Chair, Peter Mabbott, who reminded
Mr Furse that those wanting to study
a language at Imperial are more likely
to want to learn it from a course than
from books.
A draft copy of the report that will be
put to Senate was circulated to Coun-
cil members before submission this
morning. It says that whilst the Union
“agrees with the recommendation that
the Humanities Department should
be in line with the College’s strategic
aims”, the Union also believes that Im-
perial is a “truly international univer-
sity [and] supporting the development
of student’s language skills can only be
in line with these strategic aims”.
The report also argues that teaching
languages helps with “strengthening
our relationships with international in-
stitutions, both for undergraduate and
postgraduate as well as research oppor-
tunities”, as well as helping students to
start a language from scratch to allow
them to take part in the Year Abroad
programme later in their degree. It
notes that “Institute of Engineering
and Technology, Institute of Mechani-
cal Engineers, Institute of Chemical
Engineering, Institute of Physics, Roy-
al Society of Chemistry and the CBI
all have specific statements about the
value of language programmes within
degree courses”, but that the majority
of them agree that basic communica-
tion skills are far more important than
fluency.
Arguments for saving Arabic includ-
ed the fact that the College has recently
established a new Diabetes Centre in
Abu Dhabi. The main blow to students
is the Union’s decision not to support
the courses in Russian, which are im-
portant to many students within the
Royal School of Mines. The Russian
course is regularly the least subscribed
language course at Imperial, and it
seems that the opportunity to study it
is likely to be taken away from the few
who do rely on it for applying for jobs
in the oil industry.

The world beyond

The oil company Shell is
paying $15.5m (£9.5m)
to settle a case accusing
the company of human
rights abuses in the Ni-
ger Delta in the early
1990s.
The out-of-court set-
tlement came days before
the trial in New York was
due to start, the culmina-
tion of efforts by relatives of Ken Saro-Wiwa, a prominent critic of the Ni-
gerian government and Shell who was hanged in 1995. Shell was accused of
asking the then Nigerian military dictatorship to silence Mr Saro-Wiwa and
others like him.
In a statement on its website, Shell said it has “always maintained the al-
legations we false,” but that the payment to Mr Saro-Wiwa’s relatives would
“assist the process of reconciliation.” Nigerian activists have promised to
maintain pressure on Shell over the issue despite the settlement.
The legal case is another example of challenges being brought against
multi-national oil companies in developing countries. In 2002 Angola fined
Chevron for causing oil spills on its off-shore platforms and in 2004 Uno-
cal was accused of using slave labour in the construction of a pipeline in
Burma.

While not known for its cultural heritage, many of Afghanistan’s looted
treasures are returning to the country.
Greek fortresses of Alexander the Great, ancient shrines of Buddha, ob-
jects of Islamic art and remnants of Genghis Khan’s Mongol empire all lie
beneath Afghanistan’s soil.
But since the Soviet invasion in 1979, hundreds of archaeological sites
have been looted by desperate peasants and warlords who have made a lu-
crative business of smuggling the ancient antiquities out of the country. The
years of Soviet occupation, civil war and US and NATO invasion have made
the smuggler’s task very easy, and even now the 500 special police officers of
the Afghanistan Ministry of Culture can only do so much.
Recently in London 1,500 items were seized by customs officers at Hea-
throw Airport. The priceless objects were identified and catalogued by staff
at the British Museum, before being returned to Kabul Museum. While the
recovered items are a boost to the collection there, they are but a fraction
of objects already lost.

California’s school
textbooks will be go-
ing digital as Governor
Arnold Schwarzeneg-
ger announced plans
to phase out hard copy
textbooks.
“Textbooks are out-
dated, in my opinion,”
he said. “For so many
years, we’ve been trying
to teach the kids exactly
the same way.”
In a bid to slash state spending to reduce California’s budget deficit,
schools will stop buying “antiquated, heavy and expensive” textbooks. In-
stead children will learn through textbooks via computers and other digital
aides, although how the necessary quantity of electronic devices is going to
be provided is still unclear.
California, the home of Silicon Valley and a world leader in technology,
will be the first state ever to trial such an initiative, initially with Maths and
Science textbooks only, and will start later this year.

It is a case of alternative medicine,
once again, in dispute with science.
Ex-RCSU President and Physics un-
dergraduate Simon Singh has success-
fully been taken to court by the British
Chiropractic Association (BCA) after
he claimed chiropractic treatment as
“bogus.” His challenge to the verdict
against him has since brought mass at-
tention to his cause.
Writing in the Guardian newspaper
in April 2008, Singh stated the BCA’s
claim that chiropractic healthcare is
able to treat children’s colic, feeding,
ear and asthmatic problems is unsub-
stantiated without a “jot of evidence.”
He goes on to say the BCA “is the re-
spectable face of the chiropractic pro-
fession and yet it happily promotes bo-
gus treatments.”
The BCA responded to his writings
by suing him for libel, after consider-
ing his comments as “defamatory and
damaging to the BCA’s reputation.”
Giving Singh the opportunity to re-
tract his allegations, he refused to do
so.
The court case has been initially suc-
cessful for the BCA, with judge’s rul-
ing that what Singh had published was
“not comment but serious defamatory
allegations of fact against the BCA.”
Singh has been since forced to pay le-
gal costs of the proceedings.
Soon after the judge’s initial verdict,
The Guardian quickly offered to pay
for BCA’s legal costs in a out-of-court
settlement on the condition that Singh

Singh in libel case over
‘bogus’ chiropractic claim
did not appeal. However, Singh has not
taken up on this offer and is moving
forward with an appeal.
It is a case that is now attracting
worldwide debate amongst legal and
scientific circles. There is concern that
British libel laws are restricting free
discussion within science. Commenta-
tor and Nature magazine blogger, Im-
perial’s own Professor Stephen Curry,
has called question on the use of legal
threat in place of scientific proof to re-
buff challenges of scientific credibility.
He says that science “must be strong
enough to call into question any and
all claims.”
The charity Sense About Science
has subsequently launched a “Keep
Libel Laws Out of Science” campaign,
which includes a petition, in favour
of Singh. A statement on their web-
site (www.senseaboutscience.org.uk)
firmly states “the that law has no place
in scientific disputes.” The petition,
currently with over 7000 signatures, is
to be issued to the Government with
sight of alterations of legalisations.
Singh has been fervently supported
in his case against the BCA by pro-
fessionals not just science, but from
across the spectrum. Stephen Fry, Ri-
chard Dawkins and Ricky Gervais are
said to be supporters.
Singh’s reputation an internationally
renowned science author and educa-
tor earned him an MBE in 2003. Since
graduating from Imperial College, he
has published four books and worked
as science producer and director for
the BBC.
Simon Singh was President of the Royal College of Science in the 80’s
Have you seen our lecturer?
With less than a month until results
are due to be posted, and while most
of their peers are relaxing after hand-
ing in final projects, a number of Mech
Eng third and fourth years have had to
desert the bar in favour of cramming
for a viva that may be used to decide
80% of their grade for the Microproc-
essors course. While oral exams are
common place in some departments,
the step is unprecedented within the
Mechanical Engineering department,
leaving some students concerned that,
having no previous experience to help
their viva technique, they won’t per-
form to their full ability in a course
worth as much as 1/5 of the whole of
first year.
The Microprocessors course has
been causing headaches since before
the start of term, with last year’s course
lecturer taking early retirement at
short notice; leaving the course with-
out a suitable lecturer within Mech
Eng. Unwilling to let a popular course
slip of the curriculum, or be taught
by someone under-qualified to teach
it, the Mechanical Engineering sen-
ior staff turned to other departments
in search of a suitable lecturer; the
computing department suggested Mr
Craimer – a teaching associate, would
be a good candidate and described
him as ‘a good teacher’. Run during
the autumn term, Mr Craimer decided
to make a number of changes to the
manor in which the course was taught;
while students conceded he was good

at explaining concepts, their were com-
plaints that the course was difficult to
follow, poorly structured and the final
objective unclear.
In light of these concerns, Mechanci-
cal Engineering Senior Tutor, Dr Shaun
Crofton and Director of Courses, Dr
Pat Leevers met with Mr Craimer to
discuss problems that had arisen with
the course. Following their discussion,
Dr Crofton and Dr Leevers were con-
fident Mr Craimer would be able to
address problems that occurred in the
first term, when the course was run
again in the spring term.
As far as the staff were concerned,
the course ran more smoothly in the
second term, until the staff-student
committee meeting, two weeks before
the course was due to end, when it
became clear that the course was still
in a state of confusion, with the final
piece of coursework- worth 80% of the
course still unset.
While addressing the issue of un-
set coursework, it became clear Mr
Craimer was suffering from ‘ill health’
leaving him unfit to complete teaching
the course.
Further investigation within the com-
puting department found Mr Craimer
was under considerable pressure as a
teaching associate, and had been told
he was about to lose his job due to cuts
in funding. Unconfirmed reports from
within the computing department sug-
gest attempts to contact Mr Craimer
have failed and he may have a number
of reports and exam scripts, leaving
some students concerned about when
they will receive their grade.
Computing department staff have
failed to respond to a request from fe-
lix for an interview, while Mechanical
Engineering have been left trying to
find a fair manor in which to decide
grades for students taking the course
in the second term. Dr Leevers told
felix: “We’re exploring several ways to
make sure every student gets a fair and
reasonable assessment for this course.
We and DoC already talked to each one
and viva’ed them individually on the
work they submitted. But in the end,
as always, the way this information is
pulled together is up to the examina-
tion board and our external examiners.”
While Senior Tutor, Dr Crofton wished
to make it clear students should not be
disadvantaged by taking the course: “It
is a shame about the outcome of this
course and considering the circum-
stances, we will try everything we can
to make sure the student’s are not dis-
advantaged by it.”
Though it is clear the Mechanical
Engineering department are doing eve-
rything within their power to reduce
any impact on student grades, there is
concern that following the unsatisfac-
tory way in which the course was run
in first term, Mechanical Engineering
failed to monitor the progress of the
course during the second term, and
hence were unaware of problems until
it was too late to set proper assessment.
On a wider scale, this story may indi-
cate increasing pressures on academic
staff, during a recession, to spend time
on research, produce papers with a
detrimental impact on undergraduate
student education.
