As political conspiracy thrillers go,
State of Play is rather unoriginal; ful-
filling the requirements of this subgen-
re to the ‘T’. There’s the lonely, sloppy
yet brilliant investigative journalist
(Russell Crowe). There’s the morally
corrupt politician (Jeff Daniels) and
the young one full of ideals (Ben Af-
fleck) working hard to fight a big, bad
corporation.
We also need: a woman collegue and
assistant for the journalist (Rachel Mc-
Adams), a tough editor with a weak
spot for the main character (Helen
Mirren), a love affair, a few seemingly
unconnected murders, and of course
the huge and powerful company out
to protect its secret. On the aesthetic
side, you won’t be surprised to hear
the film is set in Washington or that,
curiously, the characters seem to move
around the city only at night when the
Journalism rarely gets as thrilling as Crowe makes it look.
appropriate feeling of suspense and
disquietude creates itself.
Despite there not being any consid-
erable twists on the usual formula, the
movie is very ‘watchable’. Unless some-
one is a very strict disbeliever in any
sort of conspiracy theories and the like,
you shouldn’t find any of the events de-
Hanks looking smug and Zurer looking hot – check; Ewan McGregor looking ridiculous in a cassock – check.
Science and Religion battle it out...
Angels and Demons HHHKK
Director: Ron Howard
Writer: David Koepp
Akiva Goldsman
Cast: Tom Hanks,
Ewan McGregor,
Ayelet Zurer
Based on the controversial Dan Brown
novel of the same name, Angels and
Demons shocks on many levels: the sci-
ence is complete and utter rubbish and
so are the religious aspects. But even
when you take the hackneyed plot and
extremely predictable ‘twist’ at the end
into account, I was quite shocked by the
fact I liked the film, especially when I re-
ally did not like its predecessor The Da
Vinci Code.
The premise of the film involves sci-
entists working in Geneva on the CERN
particle accelerator who finally create
‘anti-matter’, which is then stolen by
someone to be weaponised and used as a
bomb to blow up the Vatican. Cryptolo-
gist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is on the
case, tracking the secret society that is
presumed to be responsible for threat-
ening the Church and kidnapping some
of its members. Will he be able to hunt
down the person doing this before it is
too late?
Not having read the book before re-
viewing the film, the plot is a very in-
teresting and exciting one, leading us
quickly around Rome in order for Robert
Langdon and his sexy sidekick (Golds-
man) to decipher clues and save the day.
Although just a cryptologist, it seems
that Langdon can do everything and
anything, and this time round we don’t
have to stare at his horrible wig which
was very off putting in the first film.
Langdon gets into all kinds of scrapes,
being trapped, shot at and almost killed,
and this is the part of the film that is fast
flowing and fun. Although about half an
hour too long (the film’s running time
comes in at an uncomfortable two and a
half hours!) it just about keeps itself in-
teresting until the very end.
In terms of acting, Hanks seems disin-
terested – with his big fat pay check he
doesn’t need to try. His beautiful assist-
ant is almost on a par with a Bond girl,
only providing some sexy eye candy.
McGregor is entertaining and over the
top as a priest, but I think his perform-
ance suits the cheesy tone of the film.
Everyone else plays their stereotypical
one dimension characters well – almost
pantomime-like with the audience jeer-
ing or cheering when certain characters
appear on screen.
Both scientists and theologists will
laugh out loud at some of the hideous
inaccuracies. I’m no physicist, but I don’t
think it is scientifically accurate in any
way. But saying that, once we enter the
Vatican, none of the theology seems to
be accurate either, demonising Catholics
and making up things about the Church
that I’m sure are not true in a very X-Files
way.
It’s all a conspiracy! The Church is evil!
They cover up everything! But the film
tries to play a very delicate balancing act,
either by annoying both groups of peo-
ple, or appeasing them as both science
and religion are vilified and then subse-
quently redeemed.
Taking into account that this film is a
12A, I was quite shocked at some of the
levels of violence and disturbing im-
agery. Rats eat dead bodies, eyeballs are
ripped out, people are set alight whilst
alive and throats are slit – is this really
child- friendly material? Well it doesn’t
matter anyway, as I assume that 100%
of the student population of Imperial
are over 18, unless we have an 8 year-old
child prodigy skulking around campus
somewhere. But my point is that the film
was much more grisly then I anticipated,
which I think added an extra dimension
of suspense and surprise.
Since the Vatican was not allowed to
be used as a set, the interior shots are
very obvious CGI that does detract from
the film. It looks like they are walking
in front of a blue screen, and this makes
you think about the fact the Church did
not allow the film-makers to shoot the
interiors.
Science vs. Religion, an idea instilled

in us as soon as we enter the education
system. Can’t they just get along?
The whole premise of the film pits the
two head-to-head against each other,
even the title unsubtly refers to the un-
derlying idea of who are the ‘angels’ and
who are the ‘demons’. As a science uni-
versity, Imperial students must wrestle
with this argument every day, as there
are many strong Christian Unions on
campus, something that surprised me
when I first arrived at Imperial. Can the
two live happily together?
The film tries to answer this with a
slightly skewed agenda (science comes
out much better), but to appease the
American audience, the scriptwriters
picted as impossible or unreal. Rather
than trying to impress the viewer with
a confusing and overembroiled plot,
Kevin Macdonald, the director who
brought us such diverse movies as The
Last King of Scotland and Touching
the Void, makes the right decision to
keep the film simple (as simple as the
genre allows it, that is) and concentrate
on the details.
Thus State of Play is very well edit-
ted, with clever pacing that builds up
to a surprising, yet slightly anticli-
mactic, finale where the truth comes
out. With a decent cast, the director
manages to evoke solid and believable
performances from all but Ben Affleck
who remains as convincing as your
nephew in the primary school play
but with considerably less charm and
none of the ‘cute factor’ (this review-
er should probably mention her deep
prejudice against Affleck at this point).
Russell Crowe stands out as the truth
-seeking journalist, and his understat-
ed way of acting keeps Cal (the char-
acter he plays) on the level of normal
human beings and not superhuman,
super-ethical heroes found elswhere in
the movie industry.
Macdonald also opts out of unneces-
sary moralising, thus saving the film
from becoming too cheesy. All in all,
I’d have to say that although there’s not
a lot in the movie that I can criticise,
you shouldn’t worry about missing
State of Play in the cinemas. Watching
it on DVD will mean that Crowe’s new
chubby face won’t be a metre wide.
There’s no mention of the Student
Union safety issues, shitty catering or
Humanities courses cuts, but it’s still
interesting.

A Retraction
film felix would like to apologise
for a mistake printed in the May
29th edition of felix. In a caption
underneath a picture of Hugh Jack-
man as Wolverine, we said that he
had ‘steel’ claws. We then received
an email from ‘Mister Sinister’ who
wrote the following:
“It’s common knowledge that Wol-
verine’s skeleton is Adamantium,
and that it is not an element of the
periodic table but composed of iron-
related compounds put together via
a secret process, discovered by the
American metallurgist Dr. Myron
MacLain.
”
To everyone in the comic book
community, and to Mister Sinister
himself, we are very sorry for this
terrible mix up, and we apologise
if this caused any severe distress
or harm to anyone. We would like
everyone to know that Wolverine
has Adamantium claws, not steel,
and we hope that by knowing this
fact, we have enriched your lives
and rectified a terrible wrong. We
also promise to spend more time on
researching the movie before writ-
ing new photo captions.
Yours,
Film Felix
do try their best to please the religious
audience members by adding some sav-
ing grace to at least one of the Catholic
characters. I think it would be silly for
anyone to think that this plot was not
written just to be sensationalist, as the
Church conspiracy could be replaced by
a government conspiracy or something
similar with such ease that the archetyp-
al characters would slot into a different
setting without anyone noticing.
All in all, the film’s ideas, both scien-
tific and theological, are crap. But it is
still enjoyable crap, and as long as you
know that, then you can just sit back and
enjoy the fun and exciting ride, with Tom
Hanks placed firmly in the driving seat.

Mother of all trousers– men
So long... The precious few days of sun that we in Britain dub ‘Summer’ have arrived.
Fashion this season has plenty of cool (and practical!) threads for your legs.
Do men and women see fashion differently? This week we have Nathan Holford and
Kawai Wong comment on the latest trends.
THE COLOUR CRASH
I wonder how far Diane Abbot
has to read this bit before
calling felix fashion names.
But honestly anybody will kill
for her toned body and the
perfect skin tone to take on
the acid brights. SICK!
THE OLD REBELS
This has escaped our radar,
a bit late to report, do apolo-
gise, that Fanny Karst came up
with an old age rebel range.
T-shirts like “Make the end the
beginning” and “Not at your
age” etc. Her youngest model
is 60.
RIPPED TIGHTS AND A FAG
I’ve been donning the ripped
tight for quite some time now.
Walking down the streets peo-
ple either shot curious looks
at the ripped tights or if I were
(un)lucky, a few whistles from
those wearing hi-vi jackets.
Still fine. 6pm, I was standing
on the front porch of my quiet
residential road, smoking a
fag. I was in a black mini-
dress, military heels, a pair
of ripped tight and a flaming
red 80’s jacket. The Spanish
mother who lives opposite
spotted me and unusually, she
didn’t wave enthusiastically.
Every passerby glanced at me
and veered away, especially
those men who looked like
they were rushing home to
their children. Then I realised
what I must have looked like...
SHIT
Next week
The Summer Ball issue. Different
styles of affordable gowns that you
can wear. We can help you with what
you are aiming to achieve for the
special night. Ha.
Also, have your friends been
misbehaving in their beautiful
gowns? Wasted and ruined the “air”
of elegance that the dress intended
to exude? Send their embarrassing
photos to felix.fashion@imperial.
ac.uk. Well, people need to be warn
not to do a certain things in a dress...
And we’ll be decent enough to
pixelate their faces...
Suited & Booted
Girl: Don’t know where’s he
from, don’t know where’s he go-
ing. He is a woolley hat and a ri-
fle away from the Leon in Leon.
Total heart throb.
Boy: Leon is totally bad ass, and
those trousers are fucking cool.
Girl: Don’t tuck your jeans into
your boots if a guitar is likely to
be taller than you.
Boy: Taking practical measures
to preserve the dryness of your

into a fashion statement is not.

Skinny Jeans
Meggings
Girl:I need time for this concept.

and a woman, naked from the

Balls stay loose and away from
the body for a reason.
Boy: You’ve gone far enough to
buy a man bag, put your iPod in
it and save your thighs from the
pressure sores.

max. A step up from the
speedos triangles. Don’t even
have to check (the size of) your

Minging? What the...?
Ripped Tights
Acid Wash Jeans
Girl: “I rebel against everyfin
yeah. Know what ayem saying?
I pawned all my clothes for my
blings. Where are those leather
belt and the syringe?”
Boy: I rate the boots. Every-
thing else? A great mindfuck.
Girl: “I skated in from the 70’s.
Now put some Blink-182 on.”
But acid jeans are cool, you
know.
Boy: This lad might hope that
one day, he will grow up into
Pete Doherty.
Denim Shorts
Safari Max
Girl: Here we go, some normal-
ity. Something somewhere tells
me that a Power will be happy
with this form of self expression.
Boy: It’s all about wearing the
same colour palette as your girl-
friend. Or your mum.
Girl: “I look so slimey I don’t
even need lubricants.” My
pose, your place.
Boy: Camp enough to get
beats from the most liberal
of homophobes.
Straight Legged
Turn-ups
Socks-on-Top
Girl: Strawberries and a straw
hat away from those Wimble-
don box seats.
Boy: The staple trouser of
your Dad, Granddad, and
probably his Dad too. Pretty
lame? Definitely not.
Girl: How many times do I
have to say - brogue, brogue,
brogue? Buy them before eve-
ryone else wears it. Don’t tell
me I haven’t told you.
Boy: This is reasonable fashion
for the reasonable guys. Phew.
Girl: Respect. How was your
boys’ scout meeting last week?
Boy: This chap has been wait-
ing his whole life to be able to
get a way with an outfit like
this.
