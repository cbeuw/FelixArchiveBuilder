12 FELIX-
A.Sc.W.
From page 1
It formed a student section at
IC early this year, and was at first
primarily concerned with the
undergraduate syllabus in the
Chemistry Department. At that
time there was much dissatisfac-
tion among the students, and the
I.C.A.Sc.W. took upon itself to
investigate the problem and try to
discuss it with the staff, by-pass-
ing the accepted channels of RCS
Union.
Imperial College Union (and
those of the Constituent Col-
leges) is noted for lacking any
political leaning. This has been
a source of strength in its rela-
tions with the staff.
UNDERHAND DEALINGS
Last Thursday I.C.A.Sc.W.
held a meeting of Union Year
Representatives and general
members of the Council to dis-
cuss the possibility of holding a
staff-student conference on " Lec-
turing Methods" at IC. This
may be discussed at greater
length in to-morrow's Union
Meeting.
Throughout their dealings with
both the staff and the Union, the
IC Branch has been not merely
discourteous but underhand.
Keith Cavanagh stated that writ-
ten permission had been given to
conduct the survey. This has
been categorically denied by the
Registrar and the President of
IC Union.
Also, no notification of Thurs-
day's meeting was sent to the
Presidents of IC or the Constiuent
College Unions. Keith Cavanagh
considers that they do not repre-
sent general student opinion!
But, are they not the elected
representatives of the students ?
Cavanagh contends that the
members of I.C.A.Sc.W. are
rightfully "average members of
the Union." This is in spite of
the facts that, one, the associa-
tion has not been recognised by
IC Union, and, two, they have
only 160 members, of whom 70
belong to RSM (mostly PGs) and
50 (mostly UGs) are from the
Chemistry department, leaving 40
randomly distributed through
Guilds and the rest of RCS.
N.J.W. & D.I.W..
ANTI-NUS
Up to now, the N.U.S. contro-
versy has meant little to me.
However, my wife, who is a stu-
dent at another London College,
applied for a Christmas vac. job
with the G.P.O., through N.U.S.
She was told that only through
N.U.S. could she obtain a job
with the G-P.O., that N.U.S. must
receive 7/6d. for " administrative
costs," and that she must fill in
various cards and forms, all
meaningless.
A journey to the local Post
Office produced the necessary ap-
plication form without cost or
bother.
N.U.S. seems to have a chronic
case of C. Northcote Parkinson's
disease " Administrates," es-
pecially in view of its annual
annual administrative growth of
about 6 per cent. Administrative
costs soar as shown by their de-
mands for larger subscriptions
from colleges.
Thus I wholeheartedly endorse
any future anti-N.U.S. motion by
I.C. (or anyone else).

longer article by C. P. BURGESS

Where are the clay pipe meet-
ings which were held in bygone
days between the Rector (Sir
Roderick Hill) and the Union
Officers for furtherance of the
well-being of I.C.?
Scrutiny is out—once again
printed but rather thin. It is en-
courging to see that members of
Staff have written and also that
the editorial is a lucid revue
of Staff-Students in regard to
tutorials.
CROSSWORD No I.
LACK OF DRESS
SPOILS ATMOSPHERE
It was disappointing that not everybody came in fancy dress to
the Guilds-Mines Carnival on 20th November. This rather destroye.1
the carnival atmosphere.
The whole Union building had been taken over for the night
and there was a constant supply of entertainment. Consequently,
even after eight hours boredom had not set in.
DISMAL START
The Carnival started dismally. But the arrival of the Saracens
with their 100 watts of amplification invigorated all, not least the
chap near the stage who incessantly made trumpeting noises. One
of the Saracens nearly lost his temper and guitar, for, at one point
in the argument, his electric block of wood was poised dangerously
above the head of the offender.
The Cabaret was disappointing, judging by the remarks I heard.
This was largely due to a lack of continuity and unconvincing acting,
due perhaps to too little time spent on rehearsals.
FROGMAN BOND
However, there was one brilliant sketch, very well acted—a
satirically revised version of " Goldfinger " with Bond attired in frog-
man's clothing.
More dancing followed the cabaret. The Wayfarers folk singers
were suitably soothing for that hour of the morning. Finally the film
"Some Like it Hot," starring Marilyn Monroe, was very amusing
to those able to remain awake.
Carnivals are, undoubtedly, the most enjoyable social function
at I.C. For, where else can you spend a night with the girl-friend—
legitimately ?
