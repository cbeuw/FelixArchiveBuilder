On Saturday, I.C, will meet
Woolwich Polytechnic at Har-
lington in the first round of the
U.L. Cup. Last year I.C. lost the
Cup Final for the first time in six
years and captain M. Eastell is
determined to restore the Soccer
Club of the College to it, usual
dominating position.
Seven members of I.C.A.FC.
who normally play for the Lon-
don University X I will be avail-
able for this game, which is not
to be looked upon with over-
confidence. In the past, the in-
clusion of University players has
tended to unsettle the I.C. team
and at first sight the situation is
worsened this year by the fact
that U.L. have not been having
a great deal of success. How-
ever, D. Vaughan, B. Griffiths
and K. Stoddart have had a
reasonable amount of experience
with I.C. sides and should fit into
the team quite well
Ingram is a safe and experi-
enced goalkeeper and further ex-
perience will be added to the side
by the inclusion of A . Crawford,
D. Hunt, and T. Huxtable—all
long standing players. R. J.
Fairholme has been playing ex-
ceptionally well recently and Bat-
cup is much improved following

his return to I.C. after a
long vacation. The two Freshers
in the twelve, N . Johnson and
P. Bentham, are both very reli-
able and should prove to be out-
standing members of the Soccer
Club in the future.
The team will be selected from:
Ingram, Fairholme, Crawford, Hunt,
Griffiths, Johnson, Stoddart, Vaughan,
Huxtable, Eastell, Batcup, Bentham.
THE REST
Sailing
The Sarins Club has found its
long lost Firefly Dingy. The boat,
ironically named "Fiasco" disap-
peared from its berth on the
Welsh Harp two years ago. En-
quiries were made when " Fias-
co " was advertised for sale in a
well-known sailing magazine.
Basketball
The first team, playing in the
London League and U.L.U.
League has produced the follow-
ing results:
I.C. first—
60— 32 Goldsmiths-
65—30 Kingston Tech.
33_41 Woolwich.
61— 58 Chelsea.
Table Tennis
The very encouraging response
to the Table Tennis Club on
Fresher's Day and at the trials
has not been reflected in the
willingness of many team players
to play regurarly for the College.
This has been particularly true
of the lower teams and the un-
precedented step of withdrawing
the 6th team from the League has
been necessary.
The 1st and 2nd teams both
are, as yet, undefeated in Division
1 on the U.L. League, and both
are through the first two rounds
of the Caribbean CUD.
Rugby
I.C- convincingly won their first
round U.L. Cup match at Har-
lington on Nov. 18th. After ten
minutes, when I.C. had settled
down, Weisner opened the scor-
ing with a try from a loose ball.
Apart from their three-quarter
line Northern Poly, offered little
resistance to the exceptionally
fluid I.C. team. Most of the I.C.
team added to the score and
Turner kicked 10 conversions.
Result I.C. 62—0 Northern Poly.
Badminton
The Imperial College Mixed
Badminton team is this year
meeting with more success than it
has done in the past. Northern
Polytechnic were recently
squashed 8-1 and a previously
unbeaten Goldsmiths team have
been beaten 5-4.
A weakened men's first team
defeated Oxford University
Woodpeckers 5—4. Fisher and
D. Brittain both won their three
games with two wins each by R.
Milward and S. Gadre.
Cross Country
A steadily improving team has
recently beaten L.S.E. in a league
match (for the first time in two
years). Also, in the last fortnight
I.C. have beaten six teams and
lost to only two, Met. Police and
U.C.

POTENTIAL
MATERIALISES
I.C. 4 v. Goldsmiths 1
By M. Eastell
After an uncertain start I.C.
settled down well against an aver-
age Goldsmiths' side and came
close to scoring on a number of
occasions. Right-winger Batcup
was especially unlucky when he
hit an upright, and had two shots
blocked on the line. The first
goal for I.C. came after about
thirty minutes, when Bentham
beat two men, and slipped the
ball to Luxton, who side stepped
his full-back and shot into the
net from a narrow angle. How-
ever in the latter part of the first
half Goldsmiths had more of the
play, but I.C. were able to hold
out by good defensive work with
Johnson playing well-
Goldsmiths
Equalise
I.C. went straight into the
attack after the interval, but were
unable to add to their score be-
fore Goldsmiths broke away and
scored, when a right wing centre
was headed home. However, I.C.
fought back, and soon went ahead
when Smart headed in a centre
from Eastell. After this there
was a period of scrappy play in
which Goldsmiths came back into
the game, but the I.C. forwards
were still combining very well
and it came as no surprise when
first Eastell and then Batcup
scored.
This was a much improved dis-
play by I.C. who have been
threatening to play well for most
of the season.
Lessons t o be
learned
By Edward Needham
The matches on Wednesday
Nov- 25th, and the previous
Saturday provided interesting
contrasts: on the Saturday I.C.
played an average club side, Ash-
ford, and beat them four goals to
nil; on Wednesday I.C. lost by
one goal to nil against a poor St.
Barts' Hospital side. It is in-
teresting that when I.C. lost they
had their full team; yet a far
better side were beaten on the
Saturday with three reserves in
the I.C. team.
The lessons probably are these,
and they apply equally to most
other sports played in the Col-
lege : most college or hospital
sides tend to play a hard, rugged
game and tempers easily become
frayed; a club side relies, as I.C.
probably do, on a little more
sophistication. Thus I.C- score
well against club sides, but score
badly against an inferior college
side: this is because tempers are
no substitute for good hockey.
The team had the same umpire
on both days, yet significantly he
was judged to have performed
abysmally on the day I.C. lost:
less theatricals would have won
the game for I.C.
However, in spite of these lapses,
the Hockey Club have had
a good season up to date, having
won 7 out of 12 matches by clear
margins, conceding 19 goals to
34 scored. The defence, with the
strength of Castell, Phillips,
Peters and Needham, is now
being supported by a more settled
and permanent forward line:
Hough is returning to his familiar
scoring form, and the prospects
for the rest of the year remain
bright.
