FELIX 3
Venereal Diseases
WELLSOC, 23rd NOVEMBER
Dr. A. J. Dalzell-Ward, of the
Central Council for Heal h
Education
Wandering somewhat from
their usual habitat on the fringes
of modern science, Wellsian (or
worried ?) minds were brought to
bear on the very earthy problem
of V.D. In discussing the medi-
cal and social problems Dr. Ward
brought out the importance o!
educating the public in the sub-
ject and hence obtaining their co-
operation.
In discussing the disease, he
said it was the inability of the
organisms to survive in other than
hot and humid conditions that
confines its existence to the genital
tracts and its transfer to the act of
sexual intercourse. However, if
the virus is detected at an early
stage, modern antibiotics provide
a speedy and complete cure.
GONORRHEA
Gonorrhea cannot escape de-
tection in the male as it causes a
painful obstruction of the urethra
within a week of infection. In the
female however, the symptoms
may be masked by natural sys-
ICSFRE
An I.C. Society tor Racial
Equality has at last been formed.
On the initiative of Keith
Cavanagh, Chairman of IC
branch of the Association of
Scientific Workers, a meeting was
held on November 19th attended
by all interested societies. It
would take months for the Society
to receive Union recognition and
it was agreed that immediate
action must be taken to ensure that
there is a large contingent from
IC at ULUSARD's Torchight
Rally against Apartheid (held
last Monday). There would be
an intensive leaflet campaign.
Barry Utting, ICU Secretary,
was elected Chairman of ICSFRE
with Roy Clark as Secretary and
eight other Committee members.
Although Apartheid in South
Africa is the Society's immediate
major concern it was agreed that
no form of racial discrimination
would be overlooked.
"Never be persuaded to go on
any expedition that has anything
to do with camels." This was
just one of the many witty re-
marks which punctuated a talk
by Captain Keith Douglas Young
of the U.S.A.F. under the aus-
pices of the Exploration Society
last Tuesday week.
Captain Young, an Australian,
who has been in the U.S.A.F.
since the last war also stated that
if anyone bales out from an air-
craft " we guarantee he is going
to be injured."
terns until the inflammation of
the internal channels is consider-
able and recovery can at best be
achieved with the distruction of
the reproductive system.
SYPHILIS
Syphilis initially manifests itself
in inflammation of the mucus
membrane, rashes, fever and a
local ulcer. These symptoms may
however be overlooked as measles
of some other common ailment.
These symptoms subside with the
transfer of the virus into the
blood- It may be 20-25 years
before it attacks the joints, brain
or heart (aorta) causing terrible
suffering and often death.
All countries that have any
kind of health service are actively
engaged in trying to eradicate
these organisms and the mobility
of modern man has brought about
the need for world-wide co-
operation. Much has been done
but a great portion of the re-
sponsibility lies with the indi-
vidual. The dangers of the virus
in a promiscuous society are
obviously great, and prophylac-
tics provide little safety. Educa-
tion in schools was Dr. Ward's
suggestion; and reading Sennet on
contraception, obviously the Uni-
versity must be made aware of
the facts.
Next week back to the fringes
with " FUEL CELLS."
THE NEW
Ignorance of the facts of life is one of two important causes of
illegitimate births, said Sister Marjorie Lewis, of the Welfare section
of the Methodist Church, at last Friday week's S.C.M. Meeting.
Contraceptives being far from foolproof (as evidenced by the num-
ber of unmarried nurses who became pregnant) was given as the
second.
PROMISCUITY
The speaker has long been connected with the problem of
unmarried mothers, and was thus well qualified to throw out pro-
miscuous sexual relations as never being a good thing.
The much misquoted " New Morality," she went on to say does
not advocate anything un-Christian, or licentious, but merely treats
people as persons, and was a sign that the Church was at last awak-
ing to recognise the place of sex in God's plan. The previous wrong
attitudes arose from the licentious side of bygone times, and led to
the prominence and advocacy of celibacy ; the speaker was not sorry
that these ideas had at last gone.
ENGAGED COUPLES
Patience, discipline and con i-
nence were advocated as being
the best course for engaged
couples, who should not give
themselves to each other, outsile
the frame »ork of " life together "
or marriage. The much quoted
" it something goes wrong, we
will marry," rarely works.
If they do marry, they are un-
likely to be in a position to
manage financially, since an ex-
pectant wife or nursing mother
cannot easily find work. . Very
often the engagement is broken
off when the girl becomes preg-
nant. The man might realise how
badly off he will be financially,
and the girl, seeing this change
in him, might not be so sure
about his love for her.
ADULTERY
Christians should obey the
Seventh Commandment, " Thou
The speaker gave a detailed
description of the small survival
pack he always carried. This in-
cluded safety pins to repair "tears
in strategic places" and tooth
brushes—since after a short time
your mouth tastes like "the inside
of a Turkish wrestler's jock
strap! " Among other items he
described were: a midget flare
gun that shoots 300 ft. in the air,
fishing line and hooks, and 1001
other useful items.
He described buffalo shooting
" from a range of 18 inches " and
his various adventures on illegal
expeditions to Mexico and New
Guinea.
The next meeting of the Ex-
ploration Society is on Friday,
11th December.
shalt not commit adultery." A l -
though in some circumstances
this might bring hardships, it
must be accepted ; life does not
give to all what they want, and if
a girl falls in love with a married
man, she has no right to his affec-
tions.
DIVORCE
The divorce laws need revision,
claimed the speaker, who ex-
pressed astonishment at the hap-
hazard way people get married.
Marriage should not be entered
into too lightly, and should be
considered as a lifelong partner-
ship.
However, marriages that have
broken down, due for example to
incompatibility, are really no
longer marriages any more, and it
would be un-Christian not to
sanction divorce in such cases.
The speaker thought that if
both parties were practising
Christians, then they should
almost certainly be able to solve
their problems and avoid a di-
vorce, but for those with no
strong religious faith this might
be difficult. It was felt that the
Christian teaching on divorce will
eventually prevail, without the
censorious holier than them "
attitude arising from a wrong
view of sex.
To summarise the general feel-
ing at the meeting, the world has
never found a better system than
the very old one of " pre-mari-
tal chastity, and post-marital
fidelity."
