CHINESE EVENING
36 Centuries Old
On Friday, 20th, Mr. P. C.
Tung, from the School of Orien-
tal and African Studies, gave an
interesting talk on the Chinese
langage.
Chinese was first written down
in 1700 B C . with a few of the
characters originating from pic-
tures. There are about 40,000
characters in all but fortunately,
for would-be aspirants only 6,000
are in common use and, we were
told, it is possible to get by on
2,000.
Chinese is a monosyllabic
language which uses four inflex-
ions in forming words. A mistake
in pronunciation can mean the
difference between reading a book
or cutting down a tree. The word
" ma " can mean mother, what,
horse or scold, so be warned—
you might get a horse-riding
mother.
There are approximately six-
teen dialects with Mandarin un-
derstood by two-thirds of the
population. In southern China it
is possible to be in sight of your
neighbour on the next hilltop and
not be able to pass the time of
day with him, however you can
write your greetings on a note as
there is only one written language.
The evening ended with a wel-
come cup of Chinese tea and
Chinese chess for those in the
know.

A Challenge to All
In choosing " A Man For All
Seasons " for the Christmas Pro-
duction, we knew that it would
be a challenge to everybody.
From the actors' point of view
it has been a play with little
chance to get away with just
character playing and they have
had to get their teeth into a strong
text, full of mood changes, mo-
ments of high intensity and a lot
of humour, dry wit and slapstick
comedy. Most of the characters
are historical figures painted
larger than life, and yet so
minutely finished that every detail
of the text is important.
For the stage management and
the stage crew, the actual building
of the set with its spiral staircase
and catwalk would have been

enough, but there is also the
problem of flying in the different
scene changes without a single
member of the stage crew appear-
ing. Also the furniture and props
need enough research to keep
everyone happy.
Costumes, in this historical al-
legory as Bolt's play is, needed
careful thought and we have ex-
perimented with painting and
texturing materials.
As for directing; well, there
was and is so much in the play as
it stands that the problem was to
select and concentrate on one
aspect, the humanity and immedi-
ate appeal. Each character is
powerful and humorous, the plot
never hesitates for a moment as
one scene glides into another and
the climax builds up. Come and
see the result of all this effort in
the Assemby Hall, 8th, 9th, 10m,
11th December at 7.30 p.m. There
should be something to chew over
and discuss, and an evening of
full enjoyment.

WORLD GOVERNMENT
The largest single group in Parliament to-day, transcendire; the
individual parties, is the Parliamentary Association for World
Government. Mr. Paul Winner, a member of the Association, told
the Huxley Society on 19th November, that every Prime Minister in
this country and many more statesmen on the Continent and across
the Iron Curtain since the war, had paid a Hp service to the ideal.
Only mutual mistrust prevented concrete steps being taken toward it.
Any such system could only carry through the necessary period
of phased disarmament by rigidly protecting the autonomy of indi-
vidual nations. Universal co-operation might then be gained, but
any idea of armed intervention
against apartheid, petty and not-
so-petty dictatorships and assist-
ing national revolutionary strug-
gles, would have to be ruled out.
In the long term, a Universal De-
claration of Human Rights might
be implemented to cover this
question. (
VOTES BY POPULATION
Voting rights in the World As-
sembly would be by population,
contributions to finance and the
world " Peace Force " by ability
to pay. But in the absence of the
Cold War, would the rich coun-
tries still be motivated to help the
poor? In fact, the Cold War
would probably still be very
much with us.
Everybody feels he has some-
thing to lose by becoming subject
to law instead of anarchy. But
time must be won to work out
human problems ; at the moment
time is running out.
On Thursday next week, Way-
lard Young will address a joint
meeting of ULU Humanists and
the Huxley Society, under the
cryptic title " East-West and the
Shape of the World."
With fire stoked up to its maxi-
mum and safety valves blowing
o!f continuously, the driver of
Dymphna let his engine go flat
out, covered nearly two laps at
a hectic scale speed of 120 m.p.h.;
and then . . . catastrophy! En-
gine and driver's coach became
derailed, coal flew everywhere,
and the shovel embedded itself
in Harlington soil.
All in the fun and games to be
had with the 3^in. gauge model
steam loco owned by the IC
Railway Society. Named after a
heroine of Irish history, Dymphna
runs around the steeply graded
track at Harlington, trailing a
load of 2001b and straining to
keep going against the lack of
water, steam, fire, or all three.
The staccato beat of this Irish
lady being driven flat out has
been recorded for posterity, and
can be heard at ICRS's Social
Evening on 15th December. This
will include a guest speaker and
refreshments.
Meetings of the Society are
held in room 809 Elec. Eng. On
1st December, C. L . Rawbury,
Esq-, will be talking on " Some
Aspects of Suburban Train Oper-
ation " and this should be in-
teresting to commuters or non-
commuters alike.
