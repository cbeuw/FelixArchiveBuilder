4 FELI X
GENTLEMEN OF MINES
T H E C A R N I V A L
A success? Opinions seem mixed. The Wayfarers were well
received, very few slept through the film and the Saracens had us
hypnotized per normal. A large proportion wore fancy dress but only
one couple, a Minesman and his wife, dressed according to the phrase
" Black your Bottom."
The decorations which were excellent, remained in place for the
Mines Hop the following evening. This was most unfortunate for
the " bird spotters" in the Concert Hall as the light precluded the
usual eyeing up operation. The bar in consequence did a roaring trade.
SWIMMING GALA—December 11th.
A malicious rumour is circulating that Mines have secretly been
training in a certain bath tub in Southside. This is completely without
foundation and has been spread by our opponents in a desperate
attempt to dampen the enthusiasm in Mines.
Minesmen beware!! Come and Support your Team!
T H E FOREIGN STUDENTS' VISIT
Invitations have been sent to ten students from five European
Mining Schools, Clausthal, Paris, St. Etienne, Delft and Leoben, to be
entertained by the Royal School of Mines Union. The students will
be here from the 15th—19th December and a full and comprehensive
schedule has been arranged. This includes an outing on a typical
"Mines Night" and a visit to Fleet Street on the lines of the "Prospect"
trip has been suggested. To round off their visit the foreign students
will be guests at the Mines Ball.
T H E MINES B A L L
This is one of the many occasions on which a Minesman is
required to wear his d.j. A ticket will entitle you to free buffet
supper, dancing and a cabaret organised solely by Mines. Tickets are
already scarce, it is suggested that one should buy now before the
black market becomes operative.
TUBE RECORD
Do you get that envious feeling
when yoa read of student expedi-
tions hammering through the
Malayan jungle or trying to melt
the Greenland ice-cap ? D:d yoa
know 'ha you can join in such
happy athities? Positively no
Land Rovers, yaks, Sherpas or
oxygen needed. All that is
needed is a London Transport
10/- day rover ticket for the Un-
de ground and some ingenuity.
The idea is to visit all 273
stations of the London's Under-
ground is as little time as possible-
Imagine the interest in venturing
out to such primeval areas as
Sudbury, Harrow, Hatch End,
Arnos Grove, Shadwell, and
Hanger Lane.
One such expedition set out on
Saturday 21st November. It con-
sisted of Michael Win' lock, of 2
Mech. Eng., with auxiliary trans-
port in the hands of Tony Luxton.
Fortunately, a Sno-cat or Weasel
is unnecessary, our two gallant
voyagers using a grimly experi-
enced Standard 14.
Fighting the cold with thick
clothing and boredom with books,
time-tables, and stop-watches,
Michael boarded the first Central
Line train to the wilds of Ongar
at 5.12 a.m.
On arriving at this outpost of
civilisation he was whisked by car
to the frontier station at Up-
minster, and from here headed
back to London.
This set the pattern for many

The column that gives you the
news and views of Guildsmen.
Lord Mayor's Show
On Saturday, 14th November,
the populace of London cele-
brated the ancient and annual
ceremony of the " Showing of the
Lord Mayor." About 100 Guilds-
men and exactly one Bo. enjoyed
the exhibition. The ladies of
King's College were impressed by
the quality of the manhood that
escorted them in the procession.
The procession was not halted at
any time to allow the gentlemen
" to urinate in a neld" (cf.
Sennet).
and not just 20, had a roaring
good time.
Union MeeCing
The second Union Meeting will
be on Thursday, 10th December,
at 1.00 p.m. in Room 542 in the
Mechanical Dept. There will be
sport, but this will not include
trying to induce a certain D.G.B.
to drop Spanner on his H.E.A.D.
by throwing chalk at his overt
orifice.
Swimming Gala
And the next day was callecj
Stanley Tools Ltd., overcome
with gratitude because two
Guildsmen and the new magnum
sized Stanley Hammer made the
front page of a Sunday news-
paper, have benevolently pre-
sented Guilds Union with an eight
foot polystyrene spanner, which
will shortly be displayed in the
Guilds Union Office- (Note to
R.C.S. & Mines; it's inviolate).
One City Gent was delighted to
learn that eight Guildsmen " liked
his trousers."
Carnival
This years Carnival was up to
the same high standard as last
years. The Cabaret was unfortu-
nately of the same low standard
as last years. Congratulations to
the hard work from both Guilds
and Mines for ensuring that all,
such journeys, until, tired but
triumphant, he arrived at Ken-
nington at 10.51 p.m., 17 hours
39 minutes after starting, having
visited 270 stations and travelled
250 miles. He claims this as a
new London University record.
Surely this is the expedition
for the home-bound student- No
tiresome head-hunters, annoyingly
slippery mountains, and such
perils. And it seems no more
useless than many other expedi-
tions, at a fraction of their
wastage of money.

the " Swimming Gala," and was
a day of uneasy peace. Mark in
your diary now, that on Friday,
December 11th all the Presidents
of I.C. will take their annual
ablutions. Numerous Guildsmen
will doubtless wish to take advan-
take of the F R E E chariot service
to the Marshall Street Baths, in
order that they too may cheer the
Guilds victory in the swimming
events. Let us pray . . . for an-
other occasion of controlled
sport such as the day of the
" Morphy."
SPECIAL ATTRACTION: A t
great' expense, a team of dare-
devil high divers have been pro-
cured to entertain the assembled
masses.
Complaints
Gutterial ramifications are be-
lieved to have been rumoured to
have been heard- These rumours
may or may not have stated
something to the effect that many
of the functions organised by
Guilds are too childish. It would
be of invaluable assistance to the
Officers of Guilds Union, if the
Guildsmen from whom these ru-
mours emenated, would inform
the above mentioned officers per-
sonally, what alterations, if any,
they would consider necessary to
improve Guilds functions. That
is why there is an Executive.
