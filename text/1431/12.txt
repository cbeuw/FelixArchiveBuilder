It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be
one continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

Going Underground
GANTS HILL was the tube station

= 2+1+14+11=28. Job done.
So which London tube station sums to 146?
This week’s Cat Phone:
_ _ _ _ _
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.
Mentalist Maze...
I hate you all. I commend you on
doing the maze, and even say that I am
unable to do them so you must be all so
clever. And what do you do? Absolutely
bloody nothing. Thank you all for not
bothering to send me anything. If this
continues I will remove this maze all
together. Don’t push me!

yet again winners. I am assuming that
they either have resigned to failing
their exams, or are so clever that they
deem revising for pussies.

How to play:
Nonograms are logic puzzles in which cells in
a grid have to be colored or left blank accord-

lines or filled-in squares there are in any given

Big well done to Team Shotgun for winning
our brand new puzzle. Thank you for the nu-
merous entries last week- please keep them
coming. Remember that there are four iPod
Nano’s up for grabs. One for teams and one
for individuals. Oh and it doesn’t make a pic!

Putting the cat out to dry
hangman.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Hangman
felix Hangman interviews
Elle Macpherson
M
iss Elle Macpherson,
or Elle for short, is
well known for be-
ing one smoking
hot bitty, as well as
a humanitarian. Hangman decided
to ask her a few questions about her
latest humanitarian project, tackling
the sometimes dire and frankly dull
atmosphere that can exist at Imperial
College Union.
Hangman
So Elle, you have taken on the newly
created role of the Super-Happy-Fun-
Times Officer at ICU. Are you looking
forward to working at London’s big-
gest cock-fest, I mean, most prestig-
ious cock-fest, I mean... Do yourself a
favour and just leave, seriously.
Elle
No I’m not one to shy away from a
job, I’m not afraid of a challenge. I
once made Dick Cheney smile with-
out waterboarding anyone, I once gave
the Pope a boner and three days ago I
managed to turn Gordon Brown into a
credible politician, no sorry that’s im-
possible but still an impressive track
record I think you’ll agree.
Hangman
Right sure. So what’s the purpose of
your job?
Elle
Basically, I try to get Imperial stu-
dents laid but as yet I haven’t gotten
them past a nervous “Hello?”. Also I try
and get them to actually come to the
Union and fill the place up, maybe have
fun.
Hangman
Surely that’s an impossible task.
Elle
It is, I’m still trying to figure out
what’s holding this place back.
Hangman
Bad music, slow bar staff, rubber
food!
Elle
What about them? Recipe for success
I think. Anyway, I want to see why they
don’t like these things. We love them
in Australia.
Hangman
Yes but you also love racism, douche-
bag surfer clothes and kangaroos.
Elle
Oh, I see. Well what if we introduced
girls... and a lollipop scrambler.
Hangman
No idea what that is but more to the
point where are these girls going to
come from? Imperial? Other univer-
sities? The general surrounding area?
Are you fucking batshit crazy?!?!?!
The new Super-Happy-Fun-Times Officer talks to Хангман
about how she plans to improve the Union
Elle
No... Actually I have found some, but
there’s a small technicality.
Hangman
Which is?
Elle
They don’t want to come. I’ll have
to pay them to actually turn up to the
Union! Maybe dress them up a little
bit, probably use some of my Intimates
Range, you know, kinda have them as
promo girls. Hot naked, promo girls.
Hangman
I’m sure Imperial Girls here would
approve of that.
Elle
What are they?
Hangman
Not sure. So what are these anony-
mous hot naked, promo girls going to
do.
Elle
We’re going to get them to go around
and talk to the guys, tell them how in-
teresting their subject is and that their
t-shirts are really ‘trendy’. You know
ego boosting, completely unjustified
ego boosting.
Hangman
A bit transparent don’t you think?
Elle
Of course we won’t tell the male
population that the girls are only talk-
ing to them because they’re being paid.
What’s transparent about girls walking
around the union in underwear com-
plimenting guys? You’re probably won-
dering where I’m going to get these
girls from aren’t you?
Hangman
No, not really, I’m just wondering if
you have any brain cells.
Elle
America!
Hangman
Nope no brain cells. What do you
mean America?
Elle
Yep, Land of the Brave and the Free
and all of that star spangled stuff. They
ship them over by the brothel load!
They’re kept in this shithole called
Richmond University doing ‘courses’
such as “Travelology” or something like
that. What people don’t actually realise
is that it’s not really a university...
Hangman
I think everyone at Imperial realises
that
Elle
No, no, I mean it’s exists primarily
to keep the male:female ratio in the
Union on Wednesday nights to an ac-
ceptable level. If it reaches 101:1 we’re
legally obliged to shut down. It’s called
the “Get-a-Fucking-Life” Act of 1989.
Hangman
Shouldn’t you be addressing the core
issue, which is that many Imperial girls
don’t come to the Union. How are you
going to persuade them to come to the
Union.
Elle
There’s really no hope I’m afraid.
Hangman
No hope?
Elle
This is London. Why would girls with
any sense want to go to Imperial Union
when there’s a whole city of real peo-
ple with proper lives out there. Haven’t
you heard of clubs?
Hangman
Excuse me?
Elle
You know, underground, loud music,
impossible to talk, sweaty, only fun if
you’re pilled up?
Hangman
You’ve completely lost me. Anyway,
you’re saying that Imperial girls won’t
come to the Union because there are
much better places to go. Isn’t that
what you’re meant to fix? And why on
Earth would American girls come if
Imperial girls don’t
Elle
I’m going to fix it for the guys, then
maybe the girls as an after-thought.
And it’s simple, those American girls
are dumb enough to come here... and
also... ahem.... we pay them....
Hangman
WHAT?!!? So the only reason there
have been so many Americans in the
Union over the past few years has been
because we’ve paid them to come here.
What about the financial implications
of this?
Elle
What financial implications?
Hangman
What do you mean, what financial
implications?!??! You’re paying people,
no sorry AMERICAN people, to come
to the Union, you’re flushing money
down the toilet.
Elle
Sorry still not fully understand-
ing the problem here. We always lose
money, I thought that was they way it
was meant to be.
Plus the Americans are the only peo-
ple who seem to like the music we play
here, got to give the people what they
want.
Hangman
So we’re playing music that people
who are only here because we pay them
to be here like? Even though most Im-
perial students fucking hate Drum &
Bass. You don’t really know what you’re
doing, do you?
Elle
That’s not true. I know exactly what
I’m doing. I’m paying hot girls...
Hangman
well...
Elle Macpherson and Hangman pose outside the Albert Hall. You can’t
see, but Hangman has a boner... and a gun... You don’t want to know.
Elle
Ok, I’m paying slutty girls to come
to the Union and interact with the
male population here. They’re getting
paid, the DJ’s get paid and I get paid.
It’s a win-win-win combination! That’s
THREE wins?
Hangman
Right, we’re doomed. Well, thanks
very much for the interview!
Next week, I’ll be talking to the new
head of food and drink, as well as hav-
ing a look at a new addition to the
evening menu in the Union. Sources
tell us it’s edible...
We’ll see.
We didn’t actually email Elle for an interview, we just found her under
this waterfall. You see, good things come to those who wash :)
