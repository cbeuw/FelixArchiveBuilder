Coffee Break
S
o it appears that some of our
intrepid readers have taken
offence to the text section.
I fear that these people are
slightly deluded. The texts
that come in each week to the Cat
Phone are often relatively abusive,
sometimes funny, and rarely do we
personally know who they are target-
ing. These texts are the views of the
student body and go into the paper
unmoderated. They do not represent
the thoughts of the paper or any of the
editors. We do not make any up, and
all texts received are only edited for
length. Even spelling and grammatical
errors are retained in order to preserve
the authenticity of the message. We do
this with the aim to keep the meaning
of the content original and unchanged.
The motto of this paper is “keep the
cat free” or in laymans terms, “freedom
of speech.” If one thinks back to when
IC Rugby got reasonably aggravated at
a particular text, you can see to take
umbrage is not uncommon. Their sup-
porters retorted to the unknown texter
through where? The text section. It’s
clear to see that if you have a griev-
ance you should be doing three things.
Firstly realising that someone out there
is pissed the fuck off with you and felt
that the best way to insult you was
(admittedly cowardly) though the pa-
per. Secondly you need to realise that
one of the best things about this paper
is the fact that we are not tied down
by a man in a suit telling us what we
can and cannot print. Lastly you have
to realise that the purpose of the text
section is not to single out individuals,
then splash their name over 5000 cop-
ies of felix. The text section has been
part of the paper for a number of years,
yet only this year has the number ac-
tually been accessible. We apologise
if anyone has text us in the past, but
you were in fact texting an ex-editor’s
mother. I am sure she appreciated your
snippets on the concept of student life.
We decided this year that the ‘in-jok-
ey’ nature of the Coffee Break section
needed to be lost, and opening up the
texts to students was one of the steps
we took towards achieving our goal.
I am unwilling to change the editing
style of the texts, as who am I to decide
someone’s personal view is irrelevant?
I will however take more consideration
when choosing which texts to use. We
are lucky enough to live in a free coun-
try where we don’t have to conform to
predetermined ideals. This is what fe-
lix believes in and how it will remain.
If you want to read something that’s
amiable I suggest “The Very Hungry
Caterpillar”. To best of my knowledge
that book won’t be too radical.
Charles Murdoch
Battle of the Browns
Photo Explanation: “James Brown
disappears into background at a gig in
his hayday”
Known for: Being the Godfather of
Soul
Catch Phrase: “I feel good!”
Hair: Loads of it
Interesting Facts: Brown’s personal
life was marred by several brushes
with the law. At the age of 16, he was
arrested for theft and served 3 years
in prison. In 1988, Brown was ar-
rested following an alleged high-speed
car chase on Interstate 20 along the
Georgia-South Carolina state border.
He was convicted of carrying an un-
licensed pistol and assaulting a police
officer, along with various drug-related
and driving offences. Although he was
sentenced to six years in prison, he was
eventually released in 1991 after serv-
ing only three years of his sentence.
James Ashley
Photo Explanation: “And my turd this
morning was this big!”
Known for: Fucking up the British
economy. Badly.
Catch Phrase: “Getting on with the
job”
Hair: Not as much as James
Interesting Facts: He suffered a reti-
nal detachment after being kicked in
the head during an end-of-term Rugby
Union match at his old school. He was
left blind in his left eye, despite treat-
ment including several operations and
lying in a darkened room for weeks at a
time. Later at Edinburgh, while playing
tennis, he noticed the same symptoms
in his right eye. Brown underwent ex-
perimental surgery at Edinburgh Royal
Infirmary and his eye was saved.
Basically he is a bit blind which is why
he probably didn’t see the economic
cock up that was in front of him!
Photo Explanation: “The bright light
on his forehead was doing his hairline
no favours”
Known for: Winning a rigged elec-
tion to the Union building by brutally
threatening his nearest rival.
Catch Phrase: “I’m not too old! I’m
still in touch with the student body”
Hair: Oh dear oh dear oh dear!
Interesting Facts: Ashley is actually
four years old, however he has a rare
syndrome known as the ‘Benjamin
Button’ defect. If you don’t know what
I’m talking about, go and watch the
film... basically he ages backwards!
On a serious note, his experience
can only be a benefit to the Union next
year, because who else will be able to
go to the local bridge clubs and bingo
halls and fit in with the rest of the col-
lege and Union staff who have their
weekly meetings there?

So we may have
upset some people
week’s Dingbats are all based around
movies past and present. I will offer
double points if an amusing anecdote
is sent in with the correct answer. In
fact the answer need not be correct.

So you started your
vegetarian diet last
week. Excellent. By
your overweight self
not eating any meat
it will obviously help
those poor animals. What the fuck is wrong with
these veggie types? Their only purpose is to piss
people off at dinner parties, you have no effect on
farming at all. Cows are bred to be eaten in the
same way that the French are born to surrender.
Taurus
This week you
decide that the
Horoscopes editor
has gone a little bit
too far. There’s a
fine line between
creative writing and a monkey just bashing the
keyboard. You decided to give him a banana to
see what happens and rather unsurprisingly, he
can’t figure out how to open it. You decided to
do the honourable thing and shoot it, in the eye!
Horoscopes, why on earth do I let this guy do them?
He’s gone too far folks, we’ve given him one more chance to redeem himself, let us know what you think

You ran the Lon-
don Marathon last
week then did you?
Dressed as a giant
zebra. Well, well
fucking done you
fucktard. Firstly why run 26 odd miles? Cars
were invented for that purpose. Secondly if you
really must run, do it in your own time and on
the pavement. Then the buses can still run and
nobody gets pissed off. Except probably still me.
Scorpio
I would like to tell
our Horoscope
writer that what was
originally written
here was completely
inappropriate. Shagging
a transvestite would have been more morally
accepted. I would like to apologise if any offence has
ever been caused in this section. I wish to replace the
current writer, however if you feel a second chance is
in order, please text the Cat Phone. -Ed
Capricorn
Ah Capricorn, you
are to me what a
prostitute is to lube.
We go hand in hand.
Or cock in arse if you
are still thinking about
prostitutes. But just because you are a Capricorn,
it does not mean that you will pass your exams,
oh no! In fact you are more likely than most to fall
arse over tit and fail. And then you will be kicked
out of uni, the outlook looks bleak for you. Pint?
Sagittarius
This week, you suffer
from a sore throat.
You initially believe
it is swine flu, but
the only person you
know who has been to
Mexico was your French teacher. It turns out it
has something to do with taking large portions of
whole German sausage down your throat, until
you loose your gag reflex. Well at least they paid
to film you while you did it.
Cancer
Apologies to all
those Jade Goody
enthusiasts’s (go and
kill yourself, NOW)
but she had been
given the week off.
As to why? I have decided that along with Phil
Collins and Jade ‘I’m fucking dead OK?’ Goody
I want to shoot Lady Gaga. With a child’s bow
and arrow. By shoot, I mean kill. This may take
a while, volunteers please. Shotgun the arse!
Gemini
As you walk the
streets, people are
beginning to glance
oddly at you. This
begins to un-nerve
you ever so slightly.
What could it be? You desperately try to find
out and even pretend to ask directions just for
a chat. Eventually you work it out, your hair
dye is wearing out and people can see your foul
ginger roots. Fucking ginger prick.
Leo
So, last week you got
heavily fucked in the
arse on a snooker
table. Or was it pool?
Whatever. After your
cheeky shag you felt
the desperate urge to lay a cable, and the green
grass of the table top seemed the best place to
do so. Shag over and feeling thoroughly satisfied
you left. However the whole incident was caught
on CCTV for all the security guards to see. Fail!
Aries
A lot of people have
been saying it, but
no one really knows
who the Horoscopes
editor is. So I thought
I’d do everyone a
favour and say, George Murdoch, you’re a cunt!
Pisces
You wait to see what
their reaction will
be when they come
back to your desk.
As suspected they
are pissed! They see
you sniggering and decided to
teach you a lesson with some FE books. You
sit there, useless to resist as you get pounded
by the books that you should have read. Blood
pouring down your face you realise that maybe
that wasn’t the best prank, but at least you’ll
remember that you can’t have circular Finite
Elements. And also that you probably shouldn’t
write on the notes of your FE lecturer.
Aquarius
You come back
to your desk in
the library after
a gruelling exam
on Finite Element
Analysis to find that
some git has taken your seat. In a fit of rage, you
take the pencil with which you’ve been drawing
your circular FE elements (that’s not possible by
the way retard!) and draw cocks over their notes
when they go to the toilet. Classic!
