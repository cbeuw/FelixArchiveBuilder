T
he Four Inns Challenge
is an extreme hiking and
orienteering challenge
run in the Peak District by
the Scout Association and
this year Imperial was represented by,
not one, but three brave teams from
the Fellwanderers. The challenge en-
tails walking (or running) 45 miles (72
km) in a team of three or four across
some of the toughest moorland in the
Peak District, in a race that is almost
double the length of a marathon!
The brave competitors were split into
two teams of four and a team of three
and set off (minus Jim and Ed) from
the Union on Friday 4th April. Our
first stop was Derby, where we met Jim
and Ed and Jim’s mum prepared us an
epic feast to fuel us through the chal-
lenge ahead! After hungrily demolish-
ing the pasta under the guise of “carb-
loading” we drove to the start line
– Holmbridge.
Holmbridge village hall, our glam-
ourous accommodation for Friday
night, was situated behind a slightly
creepy graveyard. There was a definite
feeling of apprehension in the
group as we realised it
was now im-
possible to back out of this crazy ad-
venture – helped by Jim, who had done
the challenge once before, making re-
marks such as “it’s such a long way”
and “it hurts so much!” Many of the
other competitors were already asleep
and as I looked around I couldn’t help
noticing that a large proportion of
them seemed to be over-developed
men clearly too muscular to properly
fit inside a sleeping bag! The feeling of
apprehension deepened somewhat as
I noticed the female count was signifi-
cantly lower than the often-lamented
Imperial ratio.
The night was not a peaceful one,
the snoring reached truly thunderous
intensities and at times certain perpe-
trators seemed to synchronise, raising
suspicions that it was actually deliber-
ate and an attempt at sabotage... Thus,
we were not as well rested as we may
have been when we were awoken for
breakfast at 4am. For those of us who
hadn’t really managed to sleep
this came as less of a
blow than
might be expected, but not everyone
was in the best of spirits until their ba-
con sandwiches had been consumed.
By this point excitement had set in and
we were all eagerly anticipating our
6:20 start. However, before this we all
had to pass the equipment check and
for Ande who had already managed
to lose – he may prefer mislay – three
objects that morning this was going to
be a challenge in itself! In the end (with
some sleight of hand involving torches
and Jim getting various items of cloth-
ing confused) my team managed to
pass and we left the safety of the hut at
6:22, hoping for a time of 17 hours.
All three Fellwanderers teams start-
ed within minutes of each other but we
chose diverging routes at the beginning
and by the top of the first hill we had
lost the C team. However, at the first
check-point Fell- wanderers B had
caught up Fellwanderers
A by forgoing
waterproofs in
the wind and
rain – assum-
ing optimisti-
cally that it
would get
sunny later
and that
we’d walk
so fast we
wouldn’t
get cold.
Fell-
wanderers team A was led by Nathan-
iel, this year’s President, and his team
were determined to beat Fellwanderers
B, led by Jim the only Fellwanderer to
have attempted this challenge before.
We, of course, had other plans...
There was a general sense of fun and
frivolity in the air as teams A and B
made their way through the first four
checkpoints together. However, at the
fourth checkpoint Team B made our
move. Instead of allowing time to re-
cuperate and have a hot chocolate we
decided to immediately push on leav-
ing Team A behind. From this point
the going became a lot tougher. As
we rounded Torside reservoir and our
route became clear, I had a sinking
feeling – observing the huge mountain
ahead. It seemed interminable and the
terrain can only described as “bog”.
Also, despite having veteran Jim there
were moments of doubt as to whether
or not we were even heading in the
right direction! We saw many other
teams branching off to the right but
stuck to our path and were finally re-
warded with a view of the road down to
our lunch checkpoint – where before I
could eat I had to have water poured
all over my hands to wash them, hav-
ing been forced to re-tie my bog-in-
fested boot laces mid-way across the
mountain.
By this point the paranoia which was
to propel Fellwanderers B through the
rest of the course had begun

Fearless Fellwanderers
finish Four Inns challenge
Heather Jones reports on the challenges the Fellwanderers underwent on the gruelling and exhausting
Four Inns Challenge in the Peak District
to set in. Ande and I were so deter-
mined to beat Fellwanderers A that we
were unable to relax at the checkpoints
and after a 30 second stop would begin
to feel an irrational anxiety that they
were just behind us and if we were to
wait any longer they would catch us
up! Thus after reading the board of ar-
rivals to check they hadn’t arrived yet
and wolfing down a few sandwiches
and plenty of Haribo we were ready to
go again.
The next checkpoint was directly
below the tallest peak in the Peak Dis-
trict, Kinder Scout, which lay directly
on our path. I named it my personal
Everest and removed one of my layers
in anticipation of the effort involved in
scaling it. Jim had perhaps overdone
the motivational horror stories and we
were almost convinced that ice axes
would be needed and we should not all
expect to survive... In the end it turned
out to be less fearsome than the pre-
vious slog across the moors but as Jim
and Joe waited for Ande and I to reach
the top of the hill (again) we were still
preoccupied with Fellwanderers A...
was that them we could see at the bot-
tom of the hill? What about the team
at the checkpoint? Why had we not
brought binoculars??? Being unable to
distinguish which team they were, we
rushed on from the summit of Kinder
Scout with only a passing glance at the
view – deter-
mined not to be caught up!
On the top of Kinder Scout I was
merrily negotiating bogs when the re-
sult of a slight misjudgement (jumping
into one) almost ended in my being
consumed! I went in so deep that Ande
had to abandon his poles to grab my
arms and pull. We were lucky – I kept
both boots! The descent from Kinder
Scout was definitely the steepest gra-
dient we encountered that day and we
heard later than someone had been
hospitalised due an ankle injury in-
curred whilst descending. Those of us
with delicate knees (Ande and I) found
it both extremely challenging and ex-
cruciatingly painful in equal measure
and it was decided that overmedication
with Ibuprofen was necessary! Much
to the team’s consternation Jim prom-
ised to meet us at the next checkpoint
and practically bounced down the
hill, disappearing into the distance as
we gingerly lowered ourselves down...
When we arrived at the checkpoint,
expecting a Jim with a hot chocolate
and a smile, there was no sign of him...
Slightly miffed we went about arrang-
ing our now indispensable checkpoint
necessities, fistfuls of Haribo and Hob-
nobs dipped in milk.
When Jim turned up we were just
beginning to be concerned that he’d
abandoned us – and in a fashion he had
– whilst we’d been struggling down
Kinder Scout he’d wandered along to
the pub and had a “cheeky pint” whilst
he was waiting for us! (It’s true – there
is photographic evidence) I believe this
act alone entitles Jim to be christened
Suavest Fellwanderer 08-09! Whilst
casually chatting to the checkpoint la-
dies they happened to let slip that we
were only half way...this was a huge
blow to morale and both Ande and I
found the next hill possibly the most
difficult so far. We even debated giving
up and making the challenge into a pub
crawl instead... Ande especially was
having a huge amount of pain from the
knee he’d so carelessly sprained just a
few weeks before the challenge and at
that moment the Ibuprofen which had
sustained us both thus far was failing
him.
Just to help matters, at the top of the
hill we met three Landrovers – neces-
sitating us to leave the path to allow
them to pass.
At this point our team leader felt
the time had come for the magical
substance which made all the differ-
ence to the rest of the course. Jim had
made fudge...and not just any fudge,
this fudge was so packed with sugar, so
amazingly sweet that it had 350 calo-
ries per square! After just one square
of this “epic fudge” we were all moti-
vated again which of course had the
downside of the return of the Team A
paranoia... Ande and I had to be con-
vinced that not everyone in light blue
was a Wilfred (a Team A member) and
that there was no need for a stampede
down into Chapel-en-le-Frith – a brisk
walk would suffice.
However, the unceasing paranoia
would give us no rest and after I near-
ly left all of my checkpoint cards in
Chapel-en-le-Frith as we practically
ran out of the checkpoint, once again
convinced that Team A were on our
heels! The walk continued along a rail-
way track carrying perhaps some of the
slowest trains ever seen... It was half
past five by the time we ascended our
second last hill, up to the White Hall
checkpoint – all the time watching our
backs. We had been walking for over
11 hours straight and I for one had not
sat down once! However, by now the
end seemed near – there was only one
more checkpoint to visit before our fi-
nal descent into Buxton – the finish.
Team A reached Chapel-en-le-Frith
later and were actually both shown
the way by a helper and then en-
couraged by the same man, who
met them to check on their
progress at the next checkpoint!
The final hill was conquered
with plenty more assistance
from Jim’s epic fudge – I con-
sumed two squares at the
bottom, a quick shot of 700
calories of pure sugar and
fat – and at ten past seven
we arrived at the final
checkpoint. However, Team A and
Team C, who did not have this magical
substance to pull them through the last
hurdle and had the increased handicap
of completing it in the dark have de-
scribed the guiding wall from the top
of that hill to the final checkpoint as
both “interminable” and “frustratingly
endless”. Happily, from the last check-
point to the end was only 4 miles and
by this point finishing within 14 hours
seemed like an achievable goal for my
team – cutting an amazing 3 hours off
our original target.
Finally, the Team A paranoia began to
subside, as the end seemed just around
the corner. We ended up semi-running
the last miles into Buxton along a rough
track whilst singing and humming to
distract ourselves from the pain from
our shredded feet! One should never
underestimate the power of ‘The Final
Countdown’ as a motivator – even our
“acoustic” version! Finally, we reached
Buxton and to finish we only needed to
locate the school. We were so paranoid
about getting lost that we
accosted four
sepa-
rate groups of people to ask them for
directions – including a pair of girls
who Ande informed first that their
school had closed and then that he’d
“see them later”. Narrowly escaping po-
lice custody for this unusual behaviour
we continued towards the school...ac-
celerating as the finish approached.
We finished the race at a run – and
arrived at 8:10, just before dark. Im-
mediately upon arrival a wonderful
lady came and made us all hot choco-
late whilst Ande tried to explain to the
organisers how he’d lost the dog-tag
he was under strict instructions not
to lose! We called Rafal – an entrant
from the Fellwanderers who had been
forced not to compete due to injuries –
who had been following our progress
online. Here he let us know that our
Team A paranoia was totally unfound-
ed...they had not yet reached the last
checkpoint, and as it turns out over
an hour would pass before they did so!
The C team were faring even worse and
had only just reached the second last
checkpoint. My first mark of celebra-
tion was to take off my boots and socks.
This revealed the predictably blistered
feet that most people suffer after such
an ordeal and I realised that I
couldn’t physically
put foot-
wear on anymore and wandered off to
the shower – a necessary step before
the first aid people would see anyone!
We all got cleaned and patched up as
well as possible – in my case involving
a wholly unnecessary sized bandage
for a blister that the first aid team were
forced to syringe. We tried to wait for
Team A to finish but eventually suc-
cumbed to the temptation of food in-
stead! After some of the best – or at
least most welcome – baked potatoes
ever, we returned to the finish where,
still, none of our teams had arrived.
Eventually at 11:30 Team A arrived
with a time of 17 hours and 10 min-
utes. At this point I confess I gave up
and succumbed to sleep. Despite doing
our best none of our team managed to
stay up until 2.04 to welcome the final
Fellwanderers team back.
A set of cripples left Buxton bound
for London on April 6th, but a very
satisfied set of cripples, crippled by
wounded feet and the aching of over-
used muscles but whom would all
agree that the satisfaction that comes
from completing the Four Inns Chal-
lenge is hard to beat. We all extend our
sincere thanks to all of the staff man-
ning the checkpoints for their endless
supply of Haribo, smiles and general
optimism that made the pain so much
more bearable. I, for one, would love
to enter the Four Inns next
year.
