This Easter break proved very suc-
cessful for a group of Imperial College
students winning a major donation
for their chosen charity, the El Salva-
dor Reconstruction and Development
Project. During the three day trip to
New York City they won the grand
prize of $25,000 from J.P. Morgan’s In-
vestment Bank to help fund the work
they will be doing in El Salvador this
year.
The team was competing against six
other charity groups in the final round
of J.P. Morgan’s Good Venture Case
Competition to secure the sponsor-
ship, and came up against representa-
tives of Harvard and Stanford Uni-
versity, among others. The four Civil
Engineering students impressed the
board of judges because of their dedi-
cation to and personal involvement
with the project endeavour.
The charity is an initiative to build
earthquake resistant houses in poor
Salvadorian communities during the
summer term. From 2001 onwards,
each year a group of 10-15 students
have travelled to relevant parts of El
Salvador and lived with the community
members, whilst dedicating themselves
to the construction of safe shelters.
The finale of the Good Venture com-
petition was held on 17th April 2009
at the J.P. Morgan head offices in New
York City. The groups presented to a
high-profile judging panel, including
Alex Lynch, Chairman of North Amer-
ican Mergers & Acquisitions, as well as
other representatives from across the
bank.
Team members Raz Jabary (1st year),
Feroza Kassam (1st year), Mohammad
Mahbub (1st year) and Adam Yang
(2nd year) gave a collective presenta-
tion in which they conveyed the mes-
sage mission of the El Salvador founda-
tion and the reasons why J.P. Morgan
should put their mark on their project.
After seven competitive presentations,
Mr. Lynch announced the winners
from Imperial College.
This year, a total number of 124
teams from 74 Universities around the
world submitted their cases, of which
only 7 made it through to the final
stage. From these finalists, Imperial
College was the only non-U.S. univer-
sity to take part in the event.
Other university finalists, apart
from Harvard and Stanford, were the
University of Michigan, University
of Chicago, New York University and
Mount Holyoke College. The donation
prize will go to this year’s summer in-
volvement and should be adequate to
finance the construction of a school as
part of the team’s widened activities.
Mohammed Belal, team leader of the
2009 Project, remarks to felix with sat-
isfaction: “We put together an excellent
team with great characteristics. The
event could not have been any better”.
As for the future of the project and
how the prize money could have an

impact, Mr. Belal said, “We now have
the opportunity to expand our project
perhaps to different countries. We may
start thinking about increasing our
involvement by sending two teams to
El Salvador on an annual basis as op-
posed to one’.
The team would particularly like to
thank Alison Ahearn, who was very
supportive in providing information as
to how best present their case.
This year’s project will be concentrat-
ed on the town of Collima, situated to
the north of the capital San Salvador.
Through their work, the team aims
to make an investment into the lo-
cal health system, education system
and the environment, all of which are
key aspects that define their social
responsibility.
Team member Raz says, “We had a
great team with excellent team-work-
ing skills. We hope the finance would
be put to good use so that poor com-
munities can benefit from this as much
as possible and I would like to thank all
fellow members for their passion and
commitment to the cause”.
On the outlook for this year, team
member Feroza comments, “The
sponsorship funding from J.P. Mor-
gan allows us to take this project to
new heights, surpassing all our initial
expectations. The provision of educa-
tion for the community of Collima is
not something we ever thought our
financial remit could encompass, but
it brings a fantastic sense of complete-
ness to the project”.
During the summer term, the team
members will spend six weeks among
Collima’s local community, whilst help-
ing with the design and construction of
seismically resistant structures, which
include essential houses and retaining
walls. So be sure to watch this space for
more details on how the group got on
in El Salvador!
Engineers
travel to
Antarctica
Two students from the Faculty of En-
gineering had an opportunity to take
part in a trip of a life-time. Many peo-
ple yearn for the buzz of some of the
worlds biggest cities, or the cultural
history the oldest civilisations, whilst
some just want to enjoy the warmths
of the Meditteranean and Carribean.
Very few, however, seek out to go to
one of the remotest and coldest envi-
ronments in the world, Antartica. Jef-
fery Marlow and David Whittleson
were two such intrepid explorers who
braved the cold and the isolation to
experience one of the worlds most un-
touched environments.
The expedition gave the students
the opportunity to learn from conser-
vationists and climate change experts
about the secluded continent, as well
as giving them a desire to do more to
combat climate change. Find out about
their adventure in next week’s issue of

New Mace unveiled
to celebrate Imperial’s
independence
Students fined for parking
their bike outside Blackett
Jovan Nedić
Editor in Chief
Students cycling into College on
Wednesday morning incurred the
wrath of the Metropolitan Police
Force, as they attempted to park their
bikes into the numerous cycle racks
outside Blackett Laboratory (Physics
Department).
As students were trying to park their
bikes, several members of the Met
were waiting to issue on the spot £30
fines because they were cycling on the
pavement. In order to get to the bike
racks, students must leave the main
road, go over a two metre stretch of
pavement and then descend into the
bike parking area. Cycling on pave-
ments is considered to be illegal by
the Met Police, however, since there is
a small ramp that allows the bikes to
get onto the pavement from the main
road, it has led many students to be-
lieve that it would be acceptable for
them to mount the pavement. There is
even a small yellow line in front of the
ramp preventing any cars from parking
there and since there is no pedestrian
crossing opposite the ramp, it is not
hard to see why cyclists would assume
such a thing.
The police were there for most of the
morning and were even approached by
angry students who were protesting
the tactics employed by the Met Police.
One such student, Dominic Galliano,
told felix that “I do not object to being
fined, after all I was doing something
wrong. However, what I do object to is
the way the Met Police went about the
operation.”
Mr Galliano went on to say that “the
cynic in me would think this is just
a money making exercise (after all I
reckon in a few hours they could have
easily got about 30 students, so about
£900) but apart from that it is not the
way to raise awareness!”
Others, however, argue that this was
purely a money raising exercise. One
third year Chemistry student won-
dered “why the police were wasting so
much time fining students for cycling
on a two metre stretch of pavement?
Did they have nothing better to do that
day?”
The problem here is two-fold: is fin-
ing students for cycling on a two me-
tre stretch of pavement really a good
method to raise awareness about the
illegality of the situation? Alternatively,
which a larger percentage of the stu-
dent body believes in, was this just a
money raising exercise?
Inspector Nick Cornish from the
Knightsbridge and Belgravia Police
Department, informed felix that “[we]
received some complaints about cy-
cling on the footpath and clearly some
proactive police/PCSO actions were
needed. I will speak to the Team Ser-
geant to ensure that any tickets issued
are proportionate and fair, with the lo-
cation and duration of travel taken into
consideration.”
There do exist several options for the
large number of cyclists that come to
Imperial everyday; the most obvious of
these is to get off your bike and push it
for those two metres. Alternatively, the
small section of pavement can be made
into a cycle lane, thus overcoming the
illegality of cycling on the pavement.
An even more costly approach would
be to create a segmented pavement to
avoid any possible collisions with the
pedestrians and the cyclists.
Imperial College President, Jenny
Morgan, informed felix that “it does
seem a little ridiculous that students
have been fined just for crossing the

Taxi firm cons Imperial
NHS out of £280,000
Dina Ismail
News Correspondent
A taxi firm managed to swindle
£280,000 from Imperial College NHS
trust by billing them for thousands of
phantom trips made by a bogus driver.
Employees at Lewis Day Courier gave
their non-existent driver ‘Stuart Villas’
a fake driver number and set up a com-
puter file to list all the “journeys” he
had made on behalf of Imperial NHS,
even giving him a false North London
address and contact numbers.
On average, 20 fake journeys were
made per day by Villas in a scam that
lasted for over 18 months, with some
journeys costing £109 a time. On one
single day an astonishing 28 taxi trips
were faked, ripping off the NHS to
the tune of £900. In one instance, the
fake driver ID was used to charge £74
to take a patient just two miles home.
However, the trip had in fact been can-
celled by the hospital hours before be-
cause the patient was too ill to travel.
Employees at the firm would often
invoice trips that had been booked
then cancelled or just completely in-
vented. With hundreds of journeys
to pay for each month, NHS staff did
not usually check each one individu-
ally and often in good faith processed
invoices without question. The con-
tractor clearly aware of the gap in the
checking system, made the maximum
use out of it.
The matter only finally came to light
when an anonymous NHS office work-
er found Stuart Villas’s file. The staff
member had never heard of him and
noticed that most of his journeys in-
voiced were for cancellations. The in-
dividual contacted a national newspa-
per to expose the fraud, while the NHS
called in its own investigation team.
Since the revelations Lewis Day has
agreed to pay back £280,000 to Impe-
rial College NHS trust, but despite
the scam will continue to work for the
trust because it is tied into a five year
contract worth £6million a year, the
courier’s biggest hospital deal. Further-
more, it currently doesn’t appear that
anyone will be prosecuted.
A spokesperson for Lewis Day Medi-
cal Services has said that the director
responsible for setting up and imple-
menting the system that allowed this to
happen has since left the company and
a whole new system has been put into
place. The revelations, however, call
into question the suitability of Lewis
Day as an Imperial NHS contractor.
pavement to get into the bike rack
area.”
Miss Morgan went on to say, how-
ever, that “we would recommend that
students get off their bikes and push it
across the pavement for obvious safety
reasons.”
This is not the first time that the lo-
cal residence have brought up prob-
lems with cyclists around Imperial,
however their main concerns were
with students coming out of the arch-
way in Beit and cycling straight into
pedestrians. Terry Branch, Head of
Security, Fire and Post at Imperial told
felix that “whilst I understand why the
police were patrolling the area for this
problem following complaints from lo-
cal residents , it is a bit disappointing
that they were issuing fines instead of
informing the students or why they did
not ask college security to ask students
to dismount from their cycles when
mounting the pavement area.”
“We will be discussing the matter
with the local police force at the next
Safer Neighbourhood Meeting on 19th
May.”
Since the incident, felix has managed
to get assurances from the local police
force that incidents such as those that
transpired on Wednesday morning will
not happen again, however, they have
informed students to not take liberties
and cycle down the length of Queens-
way on their way into College.

picting the College’s crest and also in-
cludes the Goldsmiths’ Company’s coat
of arms. The new mace was unveiled at
Wednesday’s Postgraduate ceremonies
where the Rector, Sir Roy Anderson,
commented that “We are enormously
grateful to the Goldsmiths’ Company
for this generous and beautiful gift. It
was a landmark occasion for the Col-
lege to achieve independence and re-
ceive its new royal charter in 2007, and
it is wonderful to have a tangible repre-
sentation of that in this mace.”
