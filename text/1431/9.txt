Obama Sleek
How much more can we love
this woman? And I’m sure a
lot of girls who have trouble-
some hair will love her even
more for setting a sleek and
easy-to-manage hairdo trend.
A friendly hairstyle for the
summer: a nice fringe parting,
styled with medium strength
hairspray. Sick!
Colourful shoes
A new addition down in the
felix office. Replacing Coffee
Break Editor Ravi Pall is Ravi
Pall Mk. II. He’s a changed
man. Gone are the days of
the Asian tramp-cum-Metal-
lica fan, and instead a well-
preened, if not slightly over-
weight, young man. Included
in his new look are these DC
Park WCs skate shoes. Sick
or shit? I can’t decide. With
endorphin-inducing colours,
and a girth of a battleship, I’m
just confused.
UK Sans Coco Avant Chanel
The most important film of the
year, of the century, of the mil-
lenium, “Coco Before Chanel”
is released in every part of the
universe apart from England.
The film - apparently - realisti-
cally depicts the rise of an
orphan to the legend behind
Chanel. The film has received
favourable critics across the
globe. Audrey Tautou was
almost a reincarnation of
Gabrielle Chanel in the film.
But what do we know? SHIT.
SICK
SHIT
Fox hunting is on. Kawai Wong samples some of the best outfits of the week. There
is no guarantee that only the good styles are snapped in the future. So beware...
Queen of jeans
Jeans leggings are more comfortable
and friendlier than the good ol’ skinny
for the summer. Somersaults are easily
do-able and no sweaty legs either. Your
main jeans piece has to be stonewashed
this season - the paler, the older, the
more 80s, the better. Mix with cream
coloured accessories. Lemon shiffon,
navajo white are good. Wooden brace-
lets and straw hats are optional top-
ups. “I’m wearing a waistcoat from Ur-
ban Outfitters. The belt is Primark, the
denim leggings are from H&M with
a pair of Topshop canvas shoes”, says
Lizzie Boyce, a first year biologist.
Comfy school disco
Exaggerated shoulders are such a big
deal this spring by Balmain. Translate
the catwalk into high street chic by
wearing a high and horizontal collar
which draws attention to your shoul-
ders. Alternatively, buy t-shirts or
jackets with rufflings on the shoulders,
if shoulder pads repel you. Gabrielle
Yongue, a second year medical stu-
dent adores the London’s eclectic
look and likes mixing vintage and high
street chic. She is wearing a sequined
top from Topshop, a velvet skirt from
H&M and a lovely pair of suede pumps
from Urban Outfitters.
Bright cottons
You can still look as trendy as you
please in the hot summer without pil-
ing on the layers. Bright loose vests are
easy to mix and match. Wear a plain t-
shirt over a pair of leggings and acces-
sorise with an elbaroate necklace. Also
reference Giuseppe Zanotti’s spring
ad campaign - wrap up the sleeves of
a boyfriend t-shirt and tuck it in a se-
quined mini (once seen in Primark).
Couple with a pair of flat canvas dur-
ing the day and a pair of stiletto in the
night. Ishwori Gurung is a first year
biology student, she is wearing a dress
from Dorothy Perkins.
Grandfather Chic
Have you noticed the resurface of the
good ol’ gold watch? A gold Casio
combi your grandfather would have
loved is at Argos for £17. Why settle for
a simple comb-over which every other
boy seems to be wearing these days?
Go a bit wild, get in the gale and listen
to your hair flap. Third year biomedi-
cal science student Rafi Latif wears a
checkered shirt from Trinity Hospice,
skinny jeans from eBay and a copper
bracelet from India. A boy who is not
afraid to accessorise, and was seen
wearing a Barbour hunter jacket in the
winter too, can we love him more?
A
re you a trendspotter?
Do you know the differ-
ence between shirring
and ruching? Do you
browse the sartorialist
more than facebook? Do prefer fash-
ion magazines to food? Do you love
digging out rags from second hand
stores? If you answered yes to any of
the above and you are a creative writ-
er and have many budding ideas that
felix fashion can feature, we need you!
And if you are an expert in menswear,
we need you even more! Positions
for regular and freelance reporters
and contributors are open. Send us a
short letter with a brief description of
yourself and your style, plus the ideas
Attn: Fashion lovers & crazy writers Next week...
and vision you have for felix fasthion
at fashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
Here are a few reasons why you
should apply:
1) meet amazing people. In the past
two months felix has met Margy Kin-
month, a BBC broadcaster who made
the fabulous documentary “The Se-
cret World of Haute Couture”; Hi-
lary Alexander, the fashion director
of the Daily Mail and simply the best
fashion writer ever existed; Harold
Tillman, the chairman of the British
Fashion Council.
2) go to fashion shows. You’re a mem-
ber of the press, no need for bluffing.
3) be totally creative. Design your own
projects and tell the world about it.
F
ashion is always infused with
different elements of ethnic
qualities. To stay a step ahead
of trends or to create
a highly personal-
ised individual style, what
you wear traditionally in your
country may be the inspira-
tion for many fashion lovers
and trend setters. Needless
to say Imperial is an inter-
national house. And this
provides us with a gold-
en platform to explore
your country or tribe’s
special costumes. If you
have some exciting pieces
in your country’s unique
costumes that are potentially magnifi-
able on the international stage, get in
touch! Our first special feature would
be the headscarf. And in fact, the
headscarf is no stranger to the
fashion world. Models strut-
ted down the D&G catwalk
donning silk headscarves a
couple of seasons ago. Next
week on felix fashion, we
will feature the Mus-
lim hijabs. A cultural
thing for many, but a
great way to accesso-
rise your outfit and
perhaps the perfect
concealment for a
bad hair day!

The winners of Imperial College Union’s
‘Greening Imperial’ competition have
been announced, with two students
sharing the £1000 prize. The judging
panel consisting of estates staff,
the College’s new Program Director
for Corporate Social Responsibility,
academic staff, Deputy President
(Education and Welfare) and the
RCSU President who part-funded the
competition made the unanimous
decision to award the prize to two
research students, Adele Peel and
Steven Johnston for their practical
approaches to making Imperial more
sustainable. Adele’s idea tackled student
halls, proposing a competition between
halls to reduce their energy use and
waste production.
She says “I’m very pleased that
student’s in halls of residence will
finally have an incentive to use energy
efficiently! It’ll be interesting to see the
exact implementation and also which hall
will be the best!”
Steven focused on the disposable paper
cups available from catering outlets
across the College, with a three-step
approach to reducing the number we
use as well as recycling the ones handed
out. Other student proposals which
came highly commended included ideas
to reduce water bottle wastage and
composting schemes.
The Union will be working with College
to discuss the implementation of these
proposals, continuing the efforts of many
College staff
and students to
make Imperial
Greener. The
College hopes
to see its
reputation as
a sustainable
university
improve after
achieving a
disappointing ‘Fail’ in the People and
Planet 2008 Green League Tables.
Steven believes simplicity is the key,
stating “Promoting a sustainable culture
on campus will spread good habits that
the students and staff can carry with
them elsewhere in their lives.” The
People and Planet Green League 2009
will be announced in the Autumn term.
