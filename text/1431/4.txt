Hassan Joudi is wanting something else
“Why is the
human mind
so frequently
not happy with
what it has, and
occupies itself
with wanting
something else.”
F
or the male readers, if you
were anything like me when
you were 14 or 15 years old,
you would have spent much
time in front of the mirror,
eagerly inspecting your chin for some
signs of facial hair. Conversely if you’re
anything like me now, aged 19, you’d
be moaning about how fast your beard
grows and complaining at how often
you have to shave. Instead of envying
the other boys in your Year 10 class
who already had enough of a beard
to groom to a style of their choosing,
you envy the guy in your tutorial class
who doesn’t seem to need a shave for
months while you must tediously whip
out the shaver weekly, if not more
often.
This aspect of growing up is I believe
representative of the overall gulf be-
tween our thoughts and aspirations in
childhood, and those in adulthood. It is
not uncommon for young children or
teenagers to adopt the “I can’t wait to
grow up” attitude. Being older is per-
ceived to bring more freedom: more
power on how to spend your money or
more choice on what to study or where
work. Conversely it is not uncommon
for adults at times to think, “I wish I
was still a kid.” Being a child is per-
ceived to bring less responsibility: your
parents guarantee you have enough
money and the life of simply going to
school and playing with friends seems
so trouble-free and easy.
This scenario extends further to oth-
er fields of life, and this common de-
sire of always wanting something else
to fulfil our happiness is characteristic
of the human condition. In the work-
place people who have a job they aren’t
enjoying sometimes feel they just want
to quit so they don’t have to drag them-
selves out of bed every morning, and
can spend their time watching TV all
day. Of course the fact is most unem-
ployed people are desperately looking
for a job and dream of getting back
into work. At university the students
who live at home with their parents
may sometimes feel they’re “missing
out” on a lot of fun while students liv-
ing in halls will sometimes feel lonely
or loathe having to shop, cook and iron
for themselves. The same can be said
for people eagerly looking forward to a
holiday abroad, but then feeling home-
sick while they’re there. In each case
people wish they were in the other’s
position.
As human beings we have a tendency
to subconsciously focus on what we
don’t have, be this what we have lost:
our childhood, or what we have yet to
experience: growing up. We convince
ourselves that we can’t be content with
our present situation, and in short, we
can forget what we already have. It
makes sense then, that in the Arabic
language the word for human being,
insaan, is actually derived from the
word meaning forget, nasa.
As a personal example, it was the
Easter holidays when I was writing this
article, where I was trying to balance
my need to revise for the upcoming ex-
ams with my desire to relax and enjoy
the free time. I found that during the
day, while the rest of my family were
out of the house and I was left alone
with my books and lecture notes, I
felt bored and thus “couldn’t wait”
for them to return in the evening so I
could chat to them and enjoy dinner
together. However once the evening
came round, I found myself irritated at
their presence because they distracted
me from revising and led me to consid-
er studying in the library instead. And
all this in the same day!
Interestingly this mechanism for
wanting something else can work in
other ways as well. In a posh banquet
or a three-course meal, the eater can
expect a grandiose series of dishes.
First the appetisers, then the main
course will be brought forth from the
kitchen, the savoury desserts will no
doubt follow, tea or coffee may be re-
quested by the caffeine-junkies, and
perhaps finally the post-dinner drinks.
But what can often happen in the eat-
er’s mind at every stage of this gran-
diose meal is that they enjoy the new
taste in their mouth for a while. But
quickly this ‘newness’ disappears, less
pleasure is derived from eating in that
stage, and they quickly gobble down
the rest of the dish as they look for-
ward to the next stage. Much like the
toddler constantly asking the mother
for a certain toy, our moment of happi-
ness only lasts for a few seconds before
we start the cycle of wanting some-
thing else again!
That phrase “I can’t wait…” is ubiq-
uitous in all the scenarios mentioned.
“I can’t wait to go on holiday… I can’t
wait until term ends… I can’t wait for
the desserts.” In the countless self-help
books out there, you can always be
sure that ever-present on the list of top
ten ways to improve your life will be to
“live in the moment.” This philosophy
underlies many relaxation therapies
like meditation, qiqong and yoga as
well as major world religions like Hin-
duism, Buddhism, Judaism and Islam.
While our mind often tells us we will
only be content when we are think-
ing or doing something else, our hap-
piness and comfort is often easily
achieved with what we already have or
are already doing. Knowing this is one
thing, but controlling our thoughts so
the words “I can’t wait…” or “I wish…”
are not constantly circling our heads is
another more difficult task. So I urge
you, during this exam period, or in the
summer holidays when you are travel-
ling, working or staying at home, don’t
wish you were doing something else.
Live in the moment.
For David Stewart, reality TV doesn’t get more
real than Come Dine With Me
D
epending on your defi-
nition, Reality TV prob-
ably started with Candid
Camera.
The show filmed the
reactions of members of the public to
pranks, such as arranging for them to
sit behind a rigged desk which would
suddenly start to develop a will of its
own. This format was copied many
times: the British equivalent was called
‘Beadle’s About’, The Richard Taylor
Interviews, if you saw them, were es-
sentially the same idea too. Tittilated
by the ability to appear on TV for being
made a fool of, scrotum after scrotum
of idiots went out in search of fame and
started deliberately involving them-
selves in stupid situations; the Genera-
tion Game for instance, or Britain’s got
Talent, or in more disturbing guises,
Jackass and then Dirty Sanchez. How-
ever, none of these examples of Real-
ity TV is genuinely ‘Real’. They are all
essentially end-of-pier: more-or-less
freakish vaudeville shows for people
with little to no talent. They don’t have
that whiff of Post-Modernism that
marks out what we would probably
consider to be Real ‘Reality TV’, some-
thing in the Big Brother mould. Ah, Big
Brother: that televised catalogue of the
desperate antics of contestants who
want nothing more than a public hang-
ing of their own self-esteem by conflict
with other contestants who also want
nothing but the same thing. But again,
as extreme as it is, Big Brother is far too
contrived to be Real. This is, after all, a
procession of increasingly socially in-
ept/mentally unsound/pretty (stupid)
people forced into ludicrous situations
who would have fallen out with every-
one around them anyway. You could
have just as much fun in a Psychiatric
Ward.
What you need for Real Reality TV is
a real situation. Real conflict from real
people genuinely falling out with each
other. Like a fight down a pub? Almost,
but not quite--a fight down a pub is
simply a release of tension, whereas
for truly great Reality TV you need a
build up of tension. It needs to be ex-
cruciating, almost to the point of em-
barrassing the viewer. It needs to make
you scream with pain. And you can’t
scream with pain unless you can live
vicariously though the people there,
unless you can (almost) completely
and (almost) totally empathise with the
motivations of the people onscreen.
For us to empathise as much as is
necessary for our ultimate emotional
torture, we require a situation which
is very familiar to us. Well, I am mid-
dle class. So are you. Therefore we
need the most middle class thing we
can think of--a dinner party. A dinner
party is an excellent choice: it is itself a
competition, usually a collaborative ef-
fort by all attendees to be as aristocrat-
ic as they think that word means--an
opportunity to show how lower mid-
dle class one is by how much effort is
put in to show how upper middle class
you are. It’s embarrassing by construc-
tion, never mind what happens when
you add the pressure of having to cook
a three course meal, stick cameras in
front of everyone and then offer them
a cash prize if they show themselves to
be the most successfully middle class
person there. With an impossibly sar-
castic voiceover continuously deni-
grating those boorish enough to main-
tain that theirs is the best food on the
planet you have an unbeatable recipe
for watchability.
Thence we have the Channel 4 pro-
gramme Come Dine With Me, to
which I would freely admit, I am ad-
dicted. The tremendous rancour, vio-
lent malice, contempt, misanthropy,
jealousy and vitriol that such a simple
concept can generate is truly stagger-
ing. This is not to say that all episodes
are car crashes, but not knowing the
result a priori only adds to the fun. To
give you an example, a notable episode
ended with a woman (friend of mine,
actually) running around the house
with tear stained cheeks burning sage
leaves to purify the atmosphere when
a massive row erupted between sev-
eral of the participants. Quote: ‘That’s
funny, I didn’t think you had a heart./I
do darling./Really? Where?’. Such inept
insults, because of course, they can’t
just call each other cunts and bitches
like any normal person would. It’s like
an anaconda of respectability trying to
digest a small wombat of anger – all
eyes are on whether or not it’s about
to pop.
Perhaps the best episode ever in-
volved a man whose most treasured
possession was a photograph of him-
self standing next to David Cameron.
His attempt to wow his guests involved
shopping at Netto (a northern version
of Lidl/Aldi) for food that cost no more
than ten pounds to feed four people,
despite the fact that the show provides
100 pounds expenses. His menu con-
tained such wonders as a tuna and bean
salad. Recipe: one can of kidney beans,
one can of tuna, mix, done. Why would
he do something like this? I believe,
because he wanted to show the other
guests that poor people can pretend to
be middle class too, if only they had the
gumption. Naturally his food was uni-
versally reviled, particularly the spray
cream garnish on the bananas at the
end. Add to this some unfathomable
seat-squirming flirtation between two
of the contestants and it’s magic.
There’s loads on the Channel 4
Catch-Up. Get stuck in.
