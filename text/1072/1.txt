Meningitis claims
two students
SIMON WISTOW
This week saw an outbreak of
meningitis, a virulent disease that
affects the brain, in a hall of resi-
dence of the University of Wales in
Cardiff.
The five students affected were
all from University Hall in the
Cyncoed area of Cardiff, yet were
not close friends, a fact which is puz-
zling medical experts. Another dis-
turbing fact uncovered by the inves-
tigation was that there have been
cases of meningitis in the hall before.
Just five weeks ago a twenty year old
women staying at the hall was taken
ill with the disease and this time last
year a student contracted meningo-
coccal septicaemia, blood poisoning
caused by the bacteria.
The President of the Student
Union, Dot Hodge, said that the
deaths of the two students had been
traumatic "...most students of this
age are not accustomed to dealing
with this sort of grief. Our priority is
to do everything we can to help them
cope." Telephone hot-lines set up by
the University and the SU have been
swamped by
calls, mainly from
anxious parents
and worried stu-
dents.
Social life in
the campus has
ground to a halt
as, after the first
death, Bill Smith,
Director of the
Public Health
Authority, called for the cancellation
of discos and parties saying that inti-
mate contact, especially the transfer
of saliva, could spread the disease.
The symptoms to watch out for are...
Fever
Severe headache
Nausea and vomiting
Dislike of light
Stiffness of neck
Unfortunately, in viral meningitis these symp-
toms are mild and may resemble influenza. In
bacterial meningitis, the symptoms develop
rapidly, often accompanied by a red blotchy skin
rash followed by drowsiness and loss of con-
sciousness within about eight hours.
The campus bar has been closed but
more than 1,000 undergraduates
attended a rave at the Great Hall in
the SU building last Saturday night.
Fears are growing, however, with
the news that meningitis has now
spread to other universities. As well
as the thirty-two students who have
been admitted for care in Cardiff, a
further four serious cases have been
reported; two at the Southampton
Institute and two American students
at York university. There have also
been cases at Sussex, Portsmouth,
Bournemouth and Brighton.
UWC authorities are being tight-
lipped about the scare. It is known
that this is the group C bacterial
strain of meningitis, which accounts
for about 30% of all bacterial cases,
with the majority caused by group B.
The vaccine which is being used
to inoculate students is short-acting
and does not offer full protection. As
yet, there is no vaccine for strain B
although both groups can be treated
with antibiotics if caught early
enough. Bacterial meningitis is
spread by coughs, sneezes and kiss-
ing. Each year
there are about
1000 cases of
bacterial menin-
gitis, 1 in 4 of
which prove
fatal. The other,
more- common
form of meningi-
tis is the viral
kind, which can-
not be cured with
antibiotics. There are about 500
cases reported annually in the UK,
although the incidence is probably
much higher.

Question time for Dean
M U H U N T H A N THILLAI
In just under two yearstimethe med-
ical students of St Mary's and
Charing Cross will be migrating to
South Kensington. They will make
up 25% of the total student body at
Imperial College and the new
Imperial College School of Medicine
will receive 50% of the overall
research budget of Imperial College.
These huge changes will affect not
only the medics but also those cur-
rently at Imperial. It is vital that
everything runs as smoothly as possi-
ble. With this in mind a Dean's ques-
tion time was held at St Mary's last
Tuesday evening.
The Dean, John Caldwell, had
cancelled two of his previous ques-
tion times and even failed to turn up
for his own tea party at the beginning
of term, so the question and answer
session was eagerly awaited by stu-
dents.
Many of the questions revolved
around the merger of the medical
schools and the formation of the new
Imperial College School of
Medicine. One of the first was to do
