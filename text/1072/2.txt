Tender decision in store
NEWSTEAM
Student officers and staff of fmperial
College Union may have to wait
until the new year before learning if
they have been succesful in their bid
to run IC's new bookstore, currently
under construction beneath the
library.
A team from ICU's executive,
consisting Eric Allsop (President),
Piers Williams (Deputy President
Finance & Services), Mandy
Hurford (Union Manager), Louise
Van der Straeten (Finance Manager)
and Brian Roscoe (Bookstore Mana-
ger) made their formal presentation
to the College last Friday. In addition
to the tender document itself, the pre-
sentation incorporated a short speech
by Mr Allsop and computer anima-
tions showing the proposed interior
of the new bookstore, followed by a
question and answer session.
Four external companies are
known to have bid for the tender;
high street bookstores Dillons and
Waterstones, academic booksellers
Blackwells and The Modern Book
Company, which currently runs a
store for medical students near St
Mary's on Praed Street. Despite this
strong competition, Piers Williams
was in a buoyant mood as he spoke
to Felix on Wednesday: "I think it
comes down to the Union persuading
the College that we're a good risk...
we know what level of trade there's
going to be, we've done our research
very carefully."
The Union's chief advantage over
its competitors may be the benefit it
can bring to the College community
by re-investing profits from a new
bookstore into student services. The
surplus from the Union's current
bookstore, situated on the Sherfield
walkway, is used to fund clubs and
societies as well as new develop-
ments such as the refurbishment of
the Entertainments lounge in Beit
Quad. Conversly, were the Union to
lose the tender, these facilities might
face funding cuts and future projects
would be under threat.
A decision by the College is eager-
ly awaited by all those concerned.
The new bookstore is planned to be
fully operational by Easter next year.

Researchers at Imperial College's
Biology Department have developed
a new technique that could save
thousands of men with prostate can-
cer the need for distressing and
potentially fatal surgery with the
unlikely discovery of an link with
puffer fish.
Prostate cancer is caused by
tumours in the prostate gland, but is
only lethal if the tumours start form-
ing in other parts of the body. This
happens when the cancer cells
become 'metastatic'. The difficulty
in the past has always been differen-
tiating between benign tumours and
malignant ones, which contain the
metastatic cells.
The team of researchers, working
in collaboration with scientists from
the Royal Postgraduate Medical
School and the University of
Liverpool, found that by measureing
the ion currents flowing in a cell, it
was possible to distinguish between
benign and malignant cells. The
technique is used normally in the
study of nervous and muscle cells,
which are highly electrically active.
To the researchers' surprise the
metastatic cells contained a current
of sodium ions, something never
before seen in cancer cells.
This means that men with prostate
cancer could have tissue samples
tested for the malignant tumours, to
evaluate the future behaviour of a
given tumour. There has, up to now,
been no way of making such a pre-
diction and hence deciding what
treatment should be administered.
Surgery carries with it a high risk of
incontinence, impotency and even
death from infection.
The discovery of the sodium cur-
rent promises a possible non-inva-
sive therapy with the use of a sub-
stance known as tetrodotoxin, or
puffer fish poison. This poison has
been known to block the action of
sodium channels in the nervous sys-
tem and the discovery of similar
channels in tumourous cells lead to
the suggestion that it could be used to
treat cancer. Although the precise
action of the sodium channels on the
cells' ability to move around the
body is not known, preliminary stud-
ies suggest that the toxin suppresses
the cells' capacity to invade other tis-
sues and form secondary tumours.

WELLCOME FUNDS
REMOVED?
The Dealing Committee's investiga-
tion into Higher Education is due to
give a report next summer regarding
tertiary education in Britain and is at
the moment collecting reports from
various educational funding organi-
sations, including the various
research councils and charitable
trusts.
In their report sent to Sir Ron
Dealing, the Wellcome Trust, a char-
itable organisation providing scien-
tific research grants all over the
world, have argued that their grants
should not be used for the general
running of public education estab-
lishments.
The Wellcome Trust fund research
at Imperial College and have threat-
ened to move their U K sponsorship
abroad if the Government imposes
overheads for acedemic research. In
the light of recent real-terms cuts in
the science budget, further loss of
support could have a devastating
effect on British scientific develop-
ment. The Wellcome Trust and IC
have a long-standing relationship,
but should Wellcome carry out their
threat then this would be put into
jeopardy.
DON'T FORGET YOUR
LASER TOOTHBRUSH
One of the latest Imperial College
research developments is a tooth-
brush which uses laser light and a
special toothpaste with a light-sensi-
tive chemical to kill mouth bacteria.
Research into a cancer treatment
called photodynamic therapy provid-
ed the inspiration for the break-
through, which uses inactive chemi-
cals that are switched on by light.
These chemicals react with oxygen
to destroy bacterial cell membranes.
Developed by Professor David
Phillips and Ilya Eigenbrot of the
Chemistry Department the tooth-
brush will not be available for
Christmas as the project is experi-
encing a slight technical hitch. To the
dismay of all involved, a minor side
effect of the toothpaste is that it turns
them a rather fetching shade of blue.
FISHER HALL CHRISTMAS
BALL A S U C C E S S
Fisher Hall's Christmas Ball last
Saturday was a success and despite
an outrageously expensive bar, all
attending residents enjoyed the
night. The raffle in particular was
popular, due to the kind donation of
a £60 C D player by Richer Sounds,
the Kensington hi-fi shop.
