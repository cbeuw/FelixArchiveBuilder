10 COLUMNS F E L I X FRIDAY 6TH D E C E M B E R
Right, lets deal with the hockey play-
ers first. Was ever a man more mis-
understood. The anonymous writer
has completely missed the point. My
point was about the impenetrability
of some sports articles because of
these nicknames, not the nicknames
themselves. I know all about this
team spirit malarkey, but you show
me a piece on the England Cricket
team by Christopher Martin-Jenkins
in the Telegraph that refers to Ian
Botham as Beefy and I shall begin
digesting headgear. Nuff said.
lit was quite a coincidence that there
!should be an article about College
Security in last weeks Felix, as I had
already planned to mention that
esteemed band of men and women
this week. A number of people have
approached me and moaned at the
level of security at IC with regard to
bikes (you see the pressures of this
job- its me that gets all the com-
plaints, you know). I have heard a
story where someone had bits stolen
from a bike under the glare of a secu-
rity camera near Southside. There
have been instances of bicycles being
stolen from outside the Chemistry
Department. A few weeks ago, there
was a letter from the ridiculously
titled Humbaba. Excusing the pathet-
ic comment about using a pen name
to avoid the hate
mail (drastically
miscalculated —
self-importance
methinks), the let-
ter made a good
point about a bike
being stolen from
the RSM walk-
way, despite the
camera coverage, j
Clearly, some-
thing is going
badly wrong with
Security. Nobody
would expect or
want a security
blanket over
College that, to ^QJ£g Qjf

quote Felix
Leiter in Diamonds are Forever, a
mouse wearing sneakers could not
get through. However, when one
hears of examples like this, on top of
the Great Computer Swindle from
last year, the level of service begins
to look very poor. Looking around
IC, I don't think underfunding is to
blame, more a case of appaling value
for money. I
have long sus-
pected a case of
what we doctors
call Catering
Syndrome. You
may know it as
bad management.
This has been
confirmed by last
week's article,
where it emerged
that we could
only manage
25% cover for
strikers because
of trade union
regulations.
Forgive me, but
this is 1996, not
1979. People don't run organisations
like that anymore. Together with the
non-issue of swipe cards to the
Reason
replacements because of IC regula-
tions, the situation looks farcical. As
with Catering, the College should put
out to tender the contract to keep us
safe in our beds/labs. Imperial is in
the business of education, not run
ning service companies badly. Oh
and by the way, don't you think it
would be rather a good idea to record
the pictures from the cameras? It may
sound crazy, but it might prove use
fill.
The Weekly Poem, which shares this
page with your humble columnist,
has caused me problems.
Acknowledging that it is a useful foil
to my diatribes, I can't help noticing
how perpetually depressing the out-
put of PoetIC is. The tongue that pro-
nounces death and doom, our love
destroyed by the ocean, I hear the
agonising moans,/Societies sicken-
ing groans. I feel all miserable now.
So a little competition, I think. In not
more that 20 words, I write suicidal-
ly melancholic poetry because... The
winner gets ajar of lithium carbonate
and the runner up a course of Prozac.
Westminster Eye - Hamish Common
So, Imperial Coll-
.*f*~;U' ege's local MP is to
have a new "career
opportunity" after the next General
Election. Members of one of the
safest Conservative seats in the
country voted last Monday by 509
votes to 439 to deselect Sir Nicholas
Scott following a range of embar-
rassing incidents culminating in him
being found face down in the gutter
during the party conference in
Bournemouth two months ago. He
had been taken into a private room to
be told of the decision, returning
ashen-faced to the hall to discuss
their opinion of his conduct. "You
have told be in no uncertain terms
what that is. During the remainder of
my time in Parliament I will give my
wholehearted support to this party
and to John Major. I will continue
with assiduity to look after the inter-
ests of my constituents. It is a sad
moment for me."
Sir Nicholas had only just sur-
vived selection for the recently
merged Kensington and Chelsea seat
when he failed to stop after an acci-
dent where a toddler had been
trapped in a car. As Minister for the
Disabled he was censured by the dis-
abled community and his own
daughter over his policies. In a
weakened position, he faced a coali-
tion of the dotty right and those asso-
ciation members who thought
'enough is enough". The opinion on
Scott was not unanimous: said one
member ".. .it was a bit of a witch
hunt in there, and when you have a
kangaroo court and a witch hunt,
there has to be a victim, and it was
him."
I still cannot help thinking that
gettingridof a senior Tory in a bitter
battle three months before a general
election is unwise at the very least
Constituency associations aren't
famous for examining the wider
issues, like contemplating the effect
on the public of booting out a distin
guished MP three months before a
General Election. They should also
consider sort of party they want to
see after the election. Since the
departure of Margaret Thatcher in
1990, the party has seen its idealism
turned into ideology. Sir Nicholas
and others on the centre-left of the
party are an important counter-
weight to some of their shriller ban-
terings. Constituency associations
are usually more extreme in their
views than the Parliamentary party,
and Kensington and Chelsea is no
exception to this. Now they have
done their worst to Sir Nicholas, they
will no doubt engage in similar
wranglings over the new candidate.
Eurosceptics will surely be looking
for someone in the mould of|
Redwood, Cash or Tebbit. This seat
is a jewel in the eyes of those who
would seek to take it, and we can cer-
tainly look forward to some interest-
ing local debate in the ensuing
months.

The Long Journey Home
As my eyelids open to the dawn of a new day,
It is night!
The clock reads 80:11, and with puzzled interest I survey
The people sitting opposite me.
The lady with the hat reading Erye Enaj,
And the man with the Alorotom phone.
The child asleep on the beret of his mother,
She is the lady with a wedding ring on her right hand,
And the Lemac cigarettes protruding from her coat.
Next to her is the priest,
With his copy of the Elbib.
But as my mind approaches some semblance of consciousness,
I see that they are all ghouls,
See-through spectres of the night,
And the cars' lights shine through them
and blind my eyes shut again.
I must sleep,
for I will be home soon,
and everything will be normal once again.
