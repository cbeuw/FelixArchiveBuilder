Football Seconds loose out to
luck of the draw
With the league stage of the BUSA
cup over and the knockout stage
starting today the stakes were high
for IC seconds. The winner of this
match would be playing a team from
somewhere in the south-east - a day
at the seaside a distinct possibility if,
"The Slags" could pull this one off.
The opponents were LSE - the
league leaders of the division above
us. The odds looked stacked against
us, especially as three regular team
members were out with flu but we
knew that LSE couldn't match our
passion, determination or sheer good
looks.
The game started badly - with our
defence looking surprisingly shaky a
dubious penalty was conceded and
duly scored. We were two down
within ten minutes and in desperate
need of a booster from somewhere.
It came when the ball was played to
the right and latched onto by the
blonde blur that was GoldiLoz - this
week's birthday boy looking good in
his swanky new boots - who's low
cross was hammered home by the
ever goal-hungry Martin, who then
levelled the score with a sensational
lob. More defensive madness,
though, meant that at half-time the
score was 3-2 to them.
An arousing speech by Captain
Condom Steve got us going and from
the restart our hard tackling and
superb hairstyles put LSE on the
back foot. A subtle flick down the
line by simple Si sent the mighty
Robo away and his superb cross was
finished off in fine style by fourth
teamringerTak.
With the game heading into extra
time, and the ref looking at his
watch, a ball was played through our
defence. Neither Rob nor Will could
get near the LSE striker and his low
shot was deflected by goalie Steve.
Our hearts were in our mouths as,
seemingly in slow-motion, German
was fooled by a bad bounce and
forced to palm the ball off the line.
The second penalty of the day was
slotted home by LSE and there was
barely time for the game to restart.
We were left to reflect on what
might have been in a match that was
balanced, exciting and played in the
true spirit of the game. At the end of
the day, football was the winner
(Brian). Unfortunately we were the
losers.
British Indoor Rowing
championships retained
Awesome Simon Dennis (Biology
III) powered his way to victory in the
British Indoor Rowing champi-
onships in Reading last weekend.
Racing in the Under-23 division,
which was stacked to the brim with
top Oxbridge rowers, Dennis quali-
fied for the final with the fifth fastest
time. Commentators billed the final
as a clash between Oxford and
Cambridge, but Dennis was having
none of this, and was keen to keep
the trophy in the IC cabinet, Louis
Attnl having achieved victory last
year.
As the race unfolded, Dennis and
Thomas Westerling (an international
sculler) broke clear of the pack. But
with 700m of the 2km distance left to
row, Dennis roared and pulled a
series of staggering splits out of the
bag, as he trucked on to victory. His
time of 5.57 knocked seven seconds
off his personal best and was only
three seconds off the time clocked by
World record holder Greg Searle in
the Mens Senior final.
In the womens race, Alison
Trickey (Chemistry & Management
III) came within a second of victory.
In a closely fought race, she just lost
out to Elise Laverick (a World
Under-23 bronze medallist). The
womens squad was well represented
in the final, highlighting their
strength in depth.
Both Alison and Simon won the
BUSA competition, and other IC
Boat Club rowers alsofiguredhighly
in the BUSA rankings, showing that
winter training is going well, which
bodes well for the summer.
Hockey Firsts bounce back
into top form
Time for the old skool to take charge.
After a rather nervy start, 2-0 down
after 15 minutes, the IC Hockey
Firsts steamroller charged into top
gear. Two goals infiveminutes from
short corners. Chicken Bol drove in a
shot to the far post with the venom of
a python, while Marky Mark bum-
bled a pile-driver between the
goalies legs. The score remained the
same until half-time. Rent Boy deliv-
ered an epic skippers half-time talk,
prompting continued rampaging
play, buoyed by the promise of free-
beer.
But, despite this the tide began to
turn as the ginger-haired wonder of
QMW began to spur his shambles
towards greater things. Increasing
pressure from QMW resulted in a
well taken goal by their no. 15, mak-
ing the score 3-2.
This stung IC back into action,
with Sid producing a classic,
prompting the goalkeeper to put the
ball into his own net. There was no
stopping the Firsts now, another
short-corner allowing the Dutch-
come-English wonder to net our
fourth. Despite QMW's dismal
efforts to pierce our rock-solid
defence, the last laugh belonged to
IC. On the stroke of full-time Sid
netted again, this time from nearly
two full inches, making the final
score 5-3 to IC. The First's now enter
the second round of the ULU cup,
and with only a mixture of Peter
Andre fans and big girls left in the
competition, our chances of securing
trophies for the fans must be rated as
very good.
Sport in brief
RCS RUGBY
RCS started the season with a well
fought victory over QMW. RCS
started with fire with a well worked
try from Mara Woodhouse, closely
followed by the first yellow card in
college rugby history. Leading after
half-time, QMW replied by pulling
back to within two points, until tries
by Jack Pert, Kolone Yong and cap-
tain Psyco Dan, sealed the game for
RCS, despite unlucky kicking by
Andy mobile Mayes. We confirmed
our superiority by roundly defeating
them in the boatraces.
LADIES H O C K E Y
After the 10-0 win against Wye, the
IC First babes have been on a roll.
Saturday was a well earned draw
against the top of the league club,
thanks mainly to a wonderful penal-
ty flick save from Becky and then a
little goal from the amazingly, won-
derful Dutch captain.
Then, onto a deserved 2-0 win
against UMDS. Everbody played an
excellent match, and a special men-
tion must be made of the beautiful
short corners.
Our entertaining keeper kept up
the team, our defence was like an
iron wall, the halves kept it wide and
our wingers flew through the opposi-
tion.
B O A T C L U B
The IC Boat Club continued its suc-
cessful season with a win for the
mens' Novice B crew at the
University of London Sprint Regatta
last weekend. The crew, who all
started rowing in October, performed
with increasing confidence during
the day, achieving substantial wins
over the Royal Free, a composite
form Royal London and Bart's, and
the UCL novices in the final.
Such a result from the novice B
crew so early in the season highlights
the strength of the IC Boat Club at all
levels in general, and the amazing
ability of the novices in particular.
H O C K E Y THIRDS
Even though UMDS played a conti-
nental 1-4-2 formation, IC's abilities
meant a solid draw was ensured at
the end of normal time. Skank and
Curtains scored two amazing goals
between them to ensure the game
progressed to penalty flicks.
Paul Cornow scored again, along
with Digger and unbelievably, only
one of their slightiy inferior team
scored.
Through to the next round of the
London Universities cup - unbeliev-
able!
