Kings flatten Jesters
IC fall foul of R S M Football
A superlative performance by the
Kings of RSM against the Jesters of
IC Seconds led to their 100% win-
ning record remaining intact. IC
Seconds scored an unexpected and
early goal, after which RSM took
control and dominated play for the
next seventy minutes. With some of
the most dazzling and exciting play
this college has witnessed, IC
Seconds were totally embarrassed,
and to be honest might have looked
more at ease against our second
team. Two goals from Keith
Whitehead, whose scything runs
through the heart of the IC defence
led to simple tap-ins. IC goalkeeper
(Dracula - he can't hold crosses) had
a nightmare of a game, and Neil
Price and Johan Viktorsson scored
two consolation goals, more through
the inability of RSM defence than
good play.
A good team performance led to
the final 5-3 scoreline, with Neil
Price outstanding, and earning the
nomination as Man of the Match.
Painted Ladies take sweet revenge,
as Womens Rugby storm to victory
The Painted Ladies (minus the vocal
Juliette) stormed onto the pitch to
take revenge on the hated hussies
from the Royal Free.
Intense pressure from IC forced a
massive blunder by the stretched
Royal Free defence, giving IC an
early lead. Atisa put another in the
back of the net from one of the
numerous corners won by IC. After
much encouragement/abuse from the
incapacitated captain, Bente pounced
on a hopeless clearance to smash
home number three, leaving IC 3-0
up at half-time.
In the second-half, Royal Free
finally got their act together and
pulled back a lucky goal straight
after Olympia notched up IC's
fourth. However, stern defence, par-
ticularly by Steph and Hege, stopped
Royal Free getting back into the
game.
The final scoreline, a convincing
four - one victory to the Painted
ladies, proved sweet revenge. It was
a terrific performance, and the con-
gratulations for the victory must go
to both the attack and the defence, all
of whom put in sterling work.
Controversy continues to stalk
embittered Fourths
On the face of it this should have
been a mismatch; surely a comfort-
able win for the fourths? However
circumstances conspired against us
to such an extent that eight players
were unavailable, and it is down to
the team's hard work that a draw was
obtained.
After a shaky start due to so many
new faces we quickly got into our
stride and scored two quality goals,
one clinically finished by Darren, the
other a supreme 25 yard chip by
Nak. From then however Queen
Mary's dominated the game leaving
IC with only a few chances to wrap
up the game. Queen Mary's pulled
one back before halftime; a tame
shot which the 'keeper could only
push onto the post was followed up
and tapped into an empty net.
In the second half QMW wasted
various chances, though IC's
defence played their part producing
numerous last ditch tackles to keep
their goal in tact. The 'keeper also
played his part; one shot in particular
produced, at full stretch, a finger tip
save. Queen Mary's controversial
equaliser came with only minutes
remaining, from a corner our keeper
was physically obstructed from
reaching the ball and the resulting
shot was cleared off the line by Paul.
The referee said, "No obstruction"
and that the ball had crossed the line.
Everyone was outraged but despite
heated protests the goal stood.
Everybody played their part in a
good team performance, though a
mention must be given to the central
midfield duo of Adam and Nak who
were superb.
Roll on Saturday and the nutters of
UMDS...
Final thrust saves Virgin's reputation
The Womens Rugby team began
strongly (as expected), with a
defence penetration by Becky lead-
ing to a try from Petra within the first
two minutes. UCL, realising we
were no easy game, fought back
hard and soon equalised. The game
proved an unexpected struggle, with
UCL scoring again before half-time.
The forwards stormed through with
fantastic rucking, and Lynsey scored
to take it to 10-10. UCL soon scored
again, and it was only in the final
two minutes that Sarah W brought
us equal again, so we have still never
lost to UCL. Special praise goes to
all of our new recruits, who were
playing in theirfirstmatch.
C & G massacre
South Bank
S E A N FITZPATR1CK
FELIX RUGBY CORRESPONDENT
A rampant C & G side put on a
power display of rugby to emerge
victorious 38-0 against a shell
shocked South Bank Poly.
Dave Pearce opened the scoring
under the posts and Keith Beattie
danced around several men to add a
second try. Andy Gilder operating
effectively at scrum half burrowed
over for a third.
Sustained pressure in the second-
half saw flanker Martin Arye
increase the lead and further tries
followed for Chris Mutter on a
superbly executed double dummy
pop, and hooker Matt Anstead
rounding off a sweeping movement.
Fly-half Gareth Williams was in
stunning form (compared to normal)
with the boot, and slotted over four
conversions. All in all a resounding
victory for the engineers.
