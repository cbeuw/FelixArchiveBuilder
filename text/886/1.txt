In the election for the Non-Sabbatical
Felix Editor A n d y Butcher was returned
the winner against New Election. W h e n
asked how it felt he said that it 'Hasn't
sunk in yet' and he would get used to the
idea in time.
The election was called after nobody
stood for the post of Sabbatical Editor at
the beginning of the term. That election
was run due to the failure of the elected
candidate in last years vote for all the
sabbatical posts.
Despite the poll being run in
conjunction with the Union's referendum
on the College Day there was a poor turn
out all round. Out of the 517 w h o voted
on the College Day only 450 voted in the
election. Andy Butcher gained 300 votes
with New Election taking 78 votes. There
were also 72 spoilt papers.
The result means that from next term
Felix will have a full Editor controlling
the paper as opposed to it being run by
the Union Print Unit Production Manager,
Chris Stapleton. In this w a y F E L I X regains
complete editorial freedom. Chris
Stapleton commented that 'It's a good job
that we don't have to have another
election. F r o m January F E L I X will be
able to have un - restricted comment
from it's boss on the Union as well as
College, something that I haven't been
allowed to do.'
The newly elected editor will receive
an equivelent of two terms rent in
Southside for doing the job, which is
equivalent to the honoraria that a C C U
president receives. For this he will take
over the complete running of Felix,
although this will involve m u c h liason
with the Print Unit Manager, over the
production of the magazine.
