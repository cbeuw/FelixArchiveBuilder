Students rejected the proposed change to
the College Day in yesterday's
referendum. Out of the 517 w h o voted, in
the Student's Union poll on M o n d a y and
Tuesday this week, 457 said that they
were against changes and only 59 agreed
with the proposal. There was one spoilt
paper.
It has been proposed by a W o r k i n g
Party, chaired by Professor A l a n
Swanson, that the College Day be
extended from 9.00am to 6.00pm. This is
to cope with timetabling problems,
particularly in the final years.
Various questions have arisen from the
proposal, particularly those of increased
cost to the College. A longer day would
lead to increased overheads, such as
power consumption and staff wages.
There is no financial advisor on the
W o r k i n g Party, and no-one is prepared to
confirm where the extra finance will
emerge from.
The possibility of staff such as cleaners
and security having to arrive in College
earlier has also been considered. Mr
Reeves, Chief Security Officer, seemed
confident of the staff's ability to cover a
longer day. Security provide cover for all
24 hours and messengers already work
9.00am to 6.00pm, covering 7.00am to
9.00am on overtime. Departments are
opened at 7.00am regardless, as are the
car parks and so would be affected by an
earlier start. However, his deputy, M r
Briley, thought that the day 'would affect

working arrangements' and that it was 'a
matter we're keeping clear of at present.'
The Party hope to be able to alter
cleaning schedules so that the cleaners
will not have to arrive any earlier. This
will avoid the possibility of them having
to travel before the first tubes, or
disturbing early starters. T h e Rector, Sir
Eric A s h , and Mr Angus Fraser, College
Director, were both unavailable for
comment.
If the proposals are implemented by the
College, then the clubs a n d societies of
the Student's Union will have problems
with running meetings. M a n y students
will not be able to attend meetings if
their department is running along an
opposing timetable to that of the clubs.

On Sunday December 9th at 2.30pm, the
Sherfield Building will be transformed as
Jim Gibb from Physics magically takes on
the guise of Father Christmas, Roy Adams
makes a spectacular appearance as M C ,
and Martin Douglas of Mines roars around
Sherfield on a magical sleigh filled high
with presents. Other entertainment
includes a comedy circus show and a
performance by the Imperial College
Brass Quintet who will make some
Christmas music with your help.
After four years of Capers this
Christmas extravaganza is a firmly
established feature of the IC year. In a
nutshell, it's an afternoon of food and fun
in abundance. Y o u can print your o w n
personalised Christmas Cards on Apple
Macs, make faces on sticks, weave a
sparkling Christmas wreath, watch Father
Christmas float in a jar of snow, capture
your footprint in plaster, learn all you
want to k n o w about pottery and much
more. The afternoon has a uniquely
scientific flavour as children are invted to
listen to their heartbeats w i t h the team
from St Mary's, and be dazzled by
Science with the Launch Pad.
This year, handicapped children have
been invited from the social services of
Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea.
Students are invited to bring their families
or friends to enjoy the party or to help
entertain the children, along with other
students and staff from all departments,
Olave House and Fisher Hall. Proceeds
from the Christmas Caper raffle will go to
Capital Radio's 'Help a L o n d o n Child' (first
prize a £ 2 0 0 travel voucher from STA).
We also ask that gifts be brought by
children to be given to two of the local
services listed above.
