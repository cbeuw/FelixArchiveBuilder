I, Gamer
I
’m certain now that a
game can be made out
of anything. Not because
we’re seeing kooky law-
yer simulators or rhythm
action games that wouldn’t look
out of place in the Tate Modern.
It was actually a very simple
game called Kudos, with a very
curious objective.
I’d heard about Kudos a while
ago, when it was celebrated as
evidence that Indie-developed
games were the future. Like
many games, you play a man in
his twenties, ready to fight for
his future. Unlike other games,
you play an underpaid waiter
from Slough. And no, Slough
doesn’t turn out to be a base
of operations for an interna-
tional ring of robot-army-mak-
ers. Slough turns out to be full
of low-paying jobs, and brown.
Your aim? To rise in popularity
as far as you can by the age of
thirty.
EventhoughKudosisaclever
game, and a depressingly good
simulation of how to live your
life, right down to the way you
gain popularity, the game’s not
always enjoyable. It’s the kind
of game you’d tell other people
about rather than actually play
yourself. As you can see.
But the media were right
when they celebrated Kudos,
because good game or not, Ku-
dos does show why Independ-
ent games are needed. Sure
they’ll create the genius steps
that birth new genres. And as
we’re told by Introversion this
week, it’s a tough fight. But
more importantly than good
games, Indie gaming gets us
talking about games.
A trailer for the new exposé
film on violence in videogames,
“Moral Combat” (sic) shows
almost nothing but the usual
stereotypes – Lara Croft, cars
crashing, and – okay, a little
obscurely – Abe from the Odd-
world series. The reason for all
of this is that, no matter how
interesting and diverse the
shelves in Game look to us, to
the mainstream media it still
all condenses down to the same
things – sex, violence, violent
sex and sexual violence.
Indie gaming rises above a
lot of that. A quick skip through
the internet will have you res-
cuing armadillos using a Mec-
cano set, saving a friend’s mar-
riage and posing mannequins.
If no-one’s talking about these
games, then guns, girls and
garroting are all they have left
to represent games by.
Still. Slough’s pushing it a
bit.

This week in videogaming
First and foremost – if you haven’t
already been accosted by the lovely
leaflet-givers out and about through
Imperial, then you won’t be aware
that the Computer Games Club is
hosting its first LAN event this Sat-
urday (Jan 20). Admittance is free,
and they’re even sorting out the
wired and wireless magic for you.
If you fancy some Warcraft III :
Frozen Throne DotA or the ever-
popular Counterstrike 1.6. then
simply bring your laptop or desktop
along to the Union Dining Hall be-
tween 10am and 4pm. Early admis-
sions are promised drinks! Manlove
optional, not guaranteed.
Surely even the most ardent Mi-
crosoft fanboys must at last feel
sympathy for Sony, as this week
they were forced to make yet more
embarassing announcements and
apologies. As if cocking up almost
every stage of the PS3’s develop-
ment cycle wasn’t enough, this
week say Sony apologising after re-
ports of an Emmy win for the PS3’s
Sixaxis controller proved false.
It all seemed too good to be true.
The Sixaxis had allegedly won an
innovation award for it’s tilt-mo-
tion technology, despite the Wii-
mote have very similar – if not far
better – capabilities. This sparked
the predictable ranting on blogs
and forums the internet over, until
Sony admitted that someone had
misunderstood – the Playstation 2
controller was receiving the award,
and they’d reported it wrong. Oh,
Sony.
Other than that it’s been a week
of smiles for the Industry, includ-
ing Sony who reported that the
Christmas big-seller was not in
fact the XBox 360, but their original
Playstation2. Elsewhere, financial
reports are showing healthy sales
and growth during 2006 in almost
every aspect of the gaming indus-
try. America hit $12.5billion, Japan
saw ¥600billion (around $5billion)
– it all bodes well for a 2007 where
consoles sales are only just begin-
ning to pick up again.
Unless you’re a Wii owner, of
course. Nintendo’s bank balance

saw them add a few million more to
their end-of-year sales forecast for
the DS – but Wii-injuries continue
come. The most disturbing so far
involves the death of a woman from
“water intoxication” after entering
a contest on an American radio sta-
tion entitled “Hold Your Wee For
A Wii”. It seems like puns can kill,
after all.
And if there’s one aspect of the
industry feeling a financial squeeze
at the moment, then it’s probably
the media. Sales certainly weren’t
up at the offices of Ziff Davis, lead-
ing to the sale of 1Up, the renowned
gaming site, as well as the once-
monoloithic Electronic Gaming
Monthly, a magazine that once
commanded huge sales both in the
US and abroad. The Official Play-
station2 Magazine closes its doors
this month earlier than was ex-
scores.
Thereleaseschedulecouldn’tlook
quieter this week, with only a yelp
from Tennis Masters coming to the
DS, possibly hoping to take advan-
tage of an otherwise quiet week for
gaming in general. Gamers seem to
not mind very much, though, with
Burning Crusade occupying the top
slot in the game charts.
Lastly – if you haven’t bought a
DS yet, Japan thinks you’re miss-
ing out. Famitsu’s list of the 100
top-selling games of the year shows
that fifteen of the top twenty games
were on the Nintendo handheld,
with Pokemon Diamond holding
the top spot with over 4.3million
units sold.
That said, the rumour mills have
yet to be stopped talking about the
next PSP
. Assuming Sony’s PR de-
partment get it right this time.
pected, and Future Publishing cur-
rently report Cross Stitcher to be a
higher-selling publication than PC
Gamer or Edge.
It doesn’t look much happier for
the future either, now that the next-
generation of consoles are offering
demo downloads straight to the ma-
chine, cutting off a lot of the appeal
of high-street publishing.
After twenty years of nothing, the
Guinness Book Of World Records
is finally recognising people who
are unhealthily good at games once
again. Interviewing ‘elite gamer’
Greg Sakundiak, the holder of 7
arcade high scores, as well as the
oldest competitive gamer, the latest
edition of the record-breaking book
will once again dedicate a page or
two to videogames, showing the
greatest achievements in gaming,
including a table of arcade high
