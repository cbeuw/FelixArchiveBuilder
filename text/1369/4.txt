Thailand’s time of turmoil
Over a century ago, the Siam re-
gime based in Bangkok annexed
the southern provinces of what is
known today as Thailand. It has
since been under their administra-
tion, but violence still erupts amidst
the jungle, palm trees and sandy
beaches, as unhappy Islamic insur-
gents battle for independence from
the predominately Buddhist state.
In the last three years, the conflict
has claimed the lives of 1,800 peo-
ple, and has blanketed the region in
a thick fog of fear. There have been
several instances when a villager’s
head was removed and placed in
clear public view, warning anyone
else foolish enough to open shop
on a Friday that they faced a simi-
lar fate. Of course the government
intervened and told people not to
fear; to open their shops on that sa-
cred Islamic day, and to not be ter-
rorised by such acts of terrorism.
But the situation, deaths, carnage
and all, in Thailand’s problematic
south, triggered a greater political
upheaval in the nation’s capital. The
metaphorical scalp of billionaire
PrimeMinisterThaksinShinawatra
was taken whilst holidaying in sun-
ny England in the form of a blood-
less coup. Evidentially the demos
of the country had had enough of
promises to wrap up the issue in
a colourful bow tie and send it off
into the history books, but instead
provoking greater troubles and let-
ting prisoners roast to death on the
backs of transport lorries. Thaksin
Shinawatra was obviously to blame,
and by September 19 2006, he was
removed in favour of a king-backed
military commander.
That is a significant issue as the
king of Thailand is much loved and
admired, and what he says, gener-
ally goes. Shinawatra on the other
hand, has been described as slimy
and incumbent; he faced much of
the same ridicule as Tony Blair and
Sven Goran Eriksson did here in
Britain. That they promised much
- ‘Education, education, education’
and footballing glory, but all have
failed dramatically. Ex education
secretary Ruth Kelly cannot even
bare to send her children to a state
school.
The weekend saw another couple
of people die in southern Thailand.
Migrant contributions to Britain
Only three weeks into the new year
and already 2007 is proving to be a
confusing time to be an immigrant
in Britain. Romanians and Bulgar-
ians were welcomed into the Euro-
pean Union on New Year’s Day by
the Foreign Secretary Margaret
Beckett who stressed the benefits
their accession will bring to Britain.
But before the celebrations in Bu-
charest and Sofia could be cleaned
up, the Home Secretary John Reid
was restricting the right of the new
EU citizens to work in the UK, amid
fears of “mass migration”.
Within a few days there were
more mixed messages when the
Government claim that immigrants
add four billion pounds a year to
the economy was challenged by
Migration Watch UK. The anti-im-
migration think-tank analysed Gov-
ernment data to produce a report
which concluded with the mouthful
that “immigrants only contribute
four pence per person per week to
economic growth”, or as they put
it more succinctly in their press
release, a benefit “equivalent to a
Mars bar a month”.
They contended that previ-
ous efforts to assess the value of
migration had failed to consider
population increase alongside the
measured economic expansion.
With this taken into account, their
analysis claimed that the benefit
Two beheadings and one motorcy-
cle shooting. And the discussion
on the New Year’s Eve bombing
in Bangkok itself, which also killed
3 and injured 38, over whether or
not the deposed leader had a hand
in the event, continues. Some say it
was an effort to discredit his succes-
sors. What is clear is that Thaksin
denies it, and that PM Surayud says
it was the doing of ‘those who had
lost power’. As yet, the insurgents
have kept their activity within the
region that they demand independ-
ence for, barring the aforemen-
tioned city strike.
Thailand’s image as a safe and
friendly tourist destination is un-
der threat from such unwelcome
publicity. 6% of the country’s GDP
arises from the sector. There were
no significant cancellations or drop
in visitor numbers after the military
take over, but the future is again
uncertain with continuing attacks,
and violence moving into the city. In
general however, it’s probably best
to stay clear of the south. The rest
of the nation; Phuket, Krabi, Chang
Mai, James Bond Island and, heck,
even Bangkok, is as safe as houses,
so long as national telecoms selling
billionaire ex Prime Ministers stay
in Beijing.
per head is then only marginal.
For migrants, the roller coast
ride continued. Two days after Mi-
gration Watch asserted they were
of little value to anyone in Britain,
came a Bank of England report
which claimed that immigration
has bought substantial economic
benefits to Britain. David Blanch-
flower, from the Bank’s Monetary
Policy Committee, argued that
by producing less than they con-
sume migrants have kept inflation
in check. Moreover, he noted that
there is “little evidence” of immi-

ood morning every-
body. It is time once
again to relax, grab
that soothing tea or
coffee, put your feet
up and phase out into the world
of international news, disasters,
wars, espionage and (hopefully
some) politics. Whoever said that
you couldn’t think about the world
and actually know what’s going on?
(Well, at least think that you do)
I tried so hard not to start with
THAT man, but being at the helm of
the most mighty military machine
in Humanity’s history, you just can’t
miss him. I know that this “mighty
organ” tries, but Felix can’t stand
up to an entire state (even Ameri-
cans (- oh just let the hatred pass)).
President George W has certainly
been busy, and after a big jolt from
his mates Baker and Hamilton we
got: “The Bush Administration has
recently announced plans to in-
crease U.S. forces in Iraq by 20,000
troops”. So much for a radical
change of action - surely isn’t that
just going to make it worse? Coop-
eration with Iraq and Syria? - Na,
thanks though. The New Vietnam
will continue until Iraq is secure
and regionally placid to US Will.
One wonders what would happen
if there were moves from the Iraqi
government to ally with Iran, or if
there was a “democratically elect-
ed” government, i.e. in free and
fair elections, whose views the US
government despised. Would the
international community and its
leading states recognise this state?
Perhaps not.
The recent demise in Somalia of
the Union of Islamic Courts is an
example where the War on Terror
has been used to frame foreign poli-
cies with no regard except to na-
tional interests and away from the
perceived “Islamist Threat”. Ethio-
pian troops have virtually no cre-
dence with the people in Somalia.
Yet, security and just governance
do not matter where state policies
are deemed unfit, even if it means
that western states help and fund
the brutal war-lords that are now in
charge of Somalia.
I am just sick of domestic politics.
I mean really, for how long has the
Home office been broken? I’m sure
that the problem is systemic, and
the frequency of new problems in
reporting crime, tracking offenders
and the immigrant population of
Britain has been increasing for as
long as I can remember. Any beast
as big as the NHS or Home Office
has a multitude of problems. I don’t
want any scapegoats any more. If
you have the job, just do what you
want for two years. Go on - get
some kahootspa and just dictatori-
ally change whatever you want. If
each an every politician feels that
he is going to be unpopular if he
does ANYTHING meaningful, then
for God’s sake is anything going to
change?
Of course, giving away that much
power does undermine every ten-
ant of democracy that there prob-
ably is. I’d like to see a better way
if they know one, and in all honesty,
they clearly don’t.
grants contributing to unemploy-
ment amongst Britons. Indeed, by
taking jobs that many Britons are
reluctant to do, migrants have re-
duced the rate of joblessness, in
turn allowing interest rates to stay
down.
Just as it looked like the murky
waters of the immigration debate
were clearing, the consultancy firm
Capital Economics threw in a new
report and some extra handfuls of
mud. They published estimates
that immigration is far higher
than Government figures show. In
2005 for instance, the consultancy
claimed that 780,000 people emi-
grated to Britain, against the offi-
cial figure of 564,000. Accounting for
their estimate of how many people
left, they arrive at an estimate of
400,000 for net immigration, against
only 156,000 according to Govern-
ment figures. If you don’t know the
number immigrants, how can you
even begin to assess their econom-
ic impact?
Amongst all these competing
claims about whether immigrants’
financial score card falls out in the
black or the red, the wider social
debates about assimilation and in-
tegration haven’t stopped either.
Indeed, 2007 is unlikely to see a
consensus emerge on immigration.
European and London Assembly
elections will provide platforms
for anti-immigration parties such
as UKIP and the far right BNP to
make their voices heard. The threat
of the BNP actually gaining a seat in
the London Assembly is very real:
under proportional representation
they need little over five percent of
the vote to be elected.
So more confusing times for mi-
grants ahead and with little con-
sensus about their contribution to
Britain, it seems there will be only
one certainty in this debate this
year: that immigration will remain
as politically controversial as ever.
