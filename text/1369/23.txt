What a way to spend your Sundays,
but to escape the stresses of Col-
lege for a relaxing day in the coun-
try dedicated to the splendid pas-
time that is golf.
Recently, a small group of mem-
bers attempted a trip south of the
river to a golf club in Surrey. Not
knowing exactly where the club
was, our designated driver (VC
Simon) utilized his latest gadget,
GPS, to guide us directly to the
club. Problem is these devices are
only as good as the idiot who pro-
grams them, and there are in fact
2 Meadow
Roads in Surrey one of which was
a lot further away from where we
wanted to be. Guess which one we
went to?! So after nearly an hour
sitting in traffic (much enjoyed by
the boys in the back seat with three
golf bags sitting on there laps) we
had missed our tee–off time and
decided to descend on the first golf
club we found.
So more by luck than Judgment
we found South Surrey Golf Course,
and things got better when it turned
out to be cheaper than the one we
were heading for originally. After a
warm up of walking to the first tee,
the game began. Clearly everyone
was still traumatized from the jour-
ney as not a single player hit the
green on the first shot of the par
three and Simon even lost his ball.
The game pretty much developed
into the disappearing ball game,
with Danny losing his ball and then
his temper on the second. Oli Man-
aged to keep them pretty much be-
tween the trees unlike my consist-
ent slicing which baffled everyone.
The Longer holes proved opportu-
nity enough for Simon to hit some
smashing drives, if only he was as
fast up the hill as his ball was. By
the 7th hole Danny was proving the
PhDComics
Sally Gunnell technique (doesn’t
look good but runs a long way) to
be very effective where as Oli was
struggling with an Adolph (two in
the bunker).
By this time, being a cloudy win-
ter’s day, it was becoming too dark
to continue playing, and by the 12th
hole we made a dash to the 18th
where a putting competition de-
cided who would buy the Refresh-
ments (bad luck Danny!).
Golf Soc. is the new golfing soci-
ety at Imperial College, offering a
number of opportunities to those
who join. For those members with
little or no previous experience in
golf, there is an ambitious begin-
ner’s programme that will last
for 8 weeks throughout the spring
term. It will teach the basics, from
holding the club correctly, right the
way through to effective course
management.
Golf Soc. isn’t just for novices, but
experienced golfers too. The Tiger
Woods among you will have the op-
portunity to hone your skills on the
driving range before attempting
numerous courses in and around
London.
There is a number of golf related
social events, for example Pub Golf,
which is always a popular amongst
non-golfers as well, Student alumni
golf matches and the infamous
106th Bottle Match, which is due to
go ahead in February. Golf Soc. is
for anyone at Imperial with a keen
interest in the game of golf. Your
ability in this sport is not an excuse
to shy away from joining! Who says
golf is a good walk spoiled?

introductory session on Wednes-
day 24th January to register con-

I can’t believe golf is on the back page. Also, this is not them, because they had no good photographs
