Sweater vests
Supercute on girls, but
at the moment these are
thin on the ground on the
High Street. You can find
a few at River Island and
Miss Selfridge.
Ivy League
This look is hot this
season, although note
that Ivy League is not
the same as preppy. Ivy
league is striped shirts,
striped ties, college
sweatshirts, satchels (the
Mulberry Barnaby satchel
is perfection), plaid and
check.
Glasses
Well, less Ugly Betty,
more Italian/Japanese
style of plastic frames;
thin metal frames are not
the look. Goes well with
the Ivy League look to
give geek-chic overtones.
Boots
Military style rather than
goth, sci-fi geek boots.
Wear with slim cut trou-
sers/jeans to achieve a fu-
turistic military style. It is
winter, so this should be
obvious, but don't wear
this look with sunglasses
unless you're aspiring to
look like a total douche.

doublets and trousers, moved from
the battlefield to everyday wear for
civilians. It was due to innovative
sewing techniques developed for
military wear that the art of tailor-
ing arose.
During the late middle ages,
sumptuary laws were established,
restricting fashion according to so-
cial status. Sumptuary laws existed
not only in England, but around the
world, in countries such as Italy, Ja-
pan and France. In England it was
stipulated that only certain individ-
uals were allowed to wear specific
colours and types of clothing. These
laws were used by the nobility to
oppress the growing bourgeoisie in
medieval cities.
During the 18th century, the
landscape of menswear was une-
quivocally altered by the enlighten-
ment. Puritanism advocated plain
wear, and no form of ostentatious
or gaudy display. Perhaps it was
only under this extreme cultural
landscape that dandyism could
emerge. Dandies placed enormous
emphasis on physical appearance
and clothing. Charles Baudelaire
defined the dandy as one who ele-
vates aesthetics to a living religion.
"These beings have no other status,
but that of cultivating the idea of
beauty in their own persons, of sat-
isfying their passions, of feeling and
thinking ... "
Around this period fashion was
also taken to the extreme with
Macaronis – a name derived from
young men who had picked up the
vernacular of referring to anything
fashionable as "very macaroni" af-
ter travelling to Italy for the Grand
Tour. The Macaronis dressed in
high fashion with stripes and tall,
powdered wigs with a little hat on
top. Macaronis were very exag-
gerated in terms of dress, their
manner of speaking, and gambling
excessively. They were also very ef-
feminate, and were seen as being
devoid of 'traditional' values of mas-
culinity, and soon 'Macaroni' came
to be used as an insult.
Whereas in the 18th century, dress
was important to distinguish social
rank, in the 19th century aristocrat-
ic leadership was breaking down,
and egalitarianism was increasing.
The suit became a symbolic social
leveller; there was less distinction
drawn between social ranks. It also
marked a departure from the ef-
feminate fashion-directioned mode
of dress the Macaronis embraced.
Menswear catwalks have never
had much credibility, and have
acted as a side note to their female
equivalent.
However, recently menswear la-
bels have been getting more media
coverage, with more male fashion
spreads and magazines dedicated
to men's style. It's strange that wo-
menswear has dominated the spot-
light for a long time, when you think
back to the early 18th century when
dandyism was sweeping across
the nation. When did the culture of
menswear change so much that so-
ciety deemed it effeminate to have
an interest in fashion?
In the past, fashion was an impor-
tant signal of a man's status in so-
ciety. Military uniform was the big-
gest influence on menswear in the
17th century, and was used to assert
authority, and also imply the virility
of its wearer. Military wear, such as
As mass-media proliferated in
the 20th century, menswear be-
came more defined by popular cul-
ture. People aspired to the style of
iconic stars like Humphrey Bogart,
James Dean, and Fred Astaire.
Now, advertising is spreading fur-
ther into people's lives, and increas-
ingly influencing men to be as body-
conscious as women. This increase
in advertising has some negative
cultural effects: male cases of
anorexia and muscle dysmorphia
are on the increase. The spread of
mass-media has also meant that
people can now be inspired by glo-
bal culture. This is the age of the in-
dividual in the West; style is formed
by personal philosophies, and not
so affected by cultural constraints.
The increase in high-street stores
catering to men mean that fashion
is now just as accessible for men as
it is for women.
