Letters to the Editor
A letter in
support of
Shama Rahman,
DPGS
Dear all,
I would like to apologise unreserv-
edly for comments I made that
were quoted in last week’s edition
of Felix. I was neither misquoted,
nor my words taken out of context,
they were merely misjudged and
delivered in a ‘moment of mad-
ness’. Referring to Mr Eric Lai as
‘small minded’ was unjustified and
unfair and I would like to apologise
to him for this statement. Eric has
given many hours of his time up
over the last two years in service to
the ACC, and I for one appreciate
this sacrifice.

Luke is very, very
sorry; he won’t
do it again
Dear Editor,
I write to you to express my disgust
at the uninterrupted Islamophobic
bigotry on display of late in the pag-
es of your ‘newspaper.’
Having been forced to endure the
racist, xenophobic ravings of Sam
Lynas in the weeks leading up to
the end of last term, we are now
presented with a series of ‘revela-
tions’ about the supposed malfea-
sance of Shama Rahman, the cur-
rent DGPS.
Are we seriously expected to be-
lieve that her being a Muslim was
not a causal factor in your decision
to make this front-page news? It is
hard to see what other reason there
could have been to create such a
storm in a teacup.
Muslims are already under siege
in this country, and giving promi-
nence to such trivial claims on such
bigoted grounds can only serve to
heighten the feelings of alienation
Sam Lynas is
back, yes he is
Andy Sykes replies,
Hahahahahahahahaha. HAHAHA-
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
HAHAHA. Hah. Hahaha.
Dear Editor,
Re: Felix (issue no. 1368) front page
article regarding Deputy President
Graduate Students, Miss Shama
Rahman.
After reading the above article we
were shocked and concerned by the
serious nature of the allegations di-
rected against Miss Rahman. Hav-
ing worked alongside and under
the direction of Miss Rahman, we
felt compelled to highlight the posi-
tive contribution she has made and
continues to make to the Graduate
student body, specifically through
her role as Deputy President for
Graduate Students.
Throughout all the Graduate Stu-
dent Association activities meet-
ings that have been held, Miss Rah-
man has been highly motivated and
well organised, despite lacking in
support from many departments in
the university.
Miss Rahman has been able to
deal with welfare issues of PhD
students in an efficient and effec-
tive manner (in particular, a seri-
ous case that developed between
student and supervisor, where she
acted professionally and provided
sound and reasoned advice)
The ‘Three Colleges’ night was an
excellent event and a much needed
attempt to encourage integration
between student groups that rarely
get the opportunity to mix. A great
deal of positive feedback was re-
ceived from the two other colleges.
The Graduate Christmas Ball
was a great event and catered to
the graduate community specifi-
cally. The change in venue proved
to be a beneficial factor making the
night more enjoyable for all of those
who attended.
Given the seriousness of these al-
legations it is quite extraordinary
that they have been carelessly al-
lowed to leak into the public do-
main before a fair and impartial
hearing. These issues should have
been more appropriately rectified
in private and instead, have been
publicly aired with no chance for
refute. Most important, some of
these claims do not relate her abil-
ity to perform her job as a sabbati-
cal officer.
In our opinion, Miss Rahman has
done an excellent job to date and
is organised, exuberant and well
motivated. This success is particu-
larly impressive considering that
this sabbatical post is in its infancy,
with little historical guidelines or
protocol to follow. It is also impor-
tant to acknowledge that graduate
students are an inherently difficult
body of students to represent, given
the diverse nature of their work and
dispersal throughout the campuses
of Imperial. We have observed that
Miss Rahman has tried her utmost
to ensure that all graduate students
are equally represented.
Without hesitation, we believe
Miss Rahman has made and should
be allowed to continue to make, a
very valuable contribution to the
lives of graduate students at Impe-
rial. It is hard to imagine a better
candidate for this position given
the circumstances. We strongly
urge DPFS Jon Matthews to re-
think proposing the no-confidence
motion and Council not to pass the
motion if it is put before them. We
also strongly believe her removal
would be detrimental to the repre-
sentation of the graduate student
community.
Kind regards,

they currently experience. Shame
on you and your filthy rag! We will
all suffer the terrible repercussions
your activities are sure to have on
inter-community relations in this
country.
I remain, sir, your obedient
servant.

Andy Sykes replies,
Thanks for taking the time to write
a letter. I’m currently subject to a
complaint, so I must keep my com-
ments as neutral as possible.
As for the leaking of the docu-
ment, I’m afraid I cannot reveal
where I got my source from, nor
should you expect me to. A news-
paper has the right to protect its
sources..
For the record, a motion of no con-
fidence is made public at the time
it is submitted to Council, so these
allegations would have entered the
public domain at that time. If an-
other elected officer feels strongly
enough to submit a motion of no
confidence, then this is news, and
the allegations should be reported.
I’ll say no more this week. Shama
has agreed to write a letter next
week detailing her complaint, and
I shall respond to it in full. This
should provide her a chance to re-
fute the allegations publically.
I hope that’s satisfactory.
