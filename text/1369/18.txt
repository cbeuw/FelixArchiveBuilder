FairtradeSoc is an award win-
ning student campaigning society.
In 2006 Imperial Fairtrade won the
ULU Student Campaign Group of
the Year Award. To celebrate this
success we decided to launch 2007
by becoming an official college so-
ciety. With over 200 signatures sup-
porting our application and many
more people signing up to the mail-
ing list, 2007 looks to be an exciting
year.
The main aims of the society are
to promote the purchase of Fair-
trade Certified products and to
campaign for Fairtrade University
Status. Our activities will include
organising Fairtrade Fortnight,
attending Fairtrade conferences,
organising debates and speakers
at Imperial and the oppurtunity to
sample numerous and varied Fair-
trade products.
Fairtrade Fortnight is the 26th
February to the 9th March. This is
a national campaign endorsed by
the Fairtrade foundation. This year
we are looking to repeat last years
popular and very successful ‘Wine
tasting Evening’ but on a much
larger scale.
Additionally we will be running
sampling sessions at lunchtimes
across campus and a ‘Beat the
Goalie’ competition. There will be
raffle prizes to be won, competi-
tions to enter and lots of Fairtrade
products on display. We are even
looking to pilot the first annual Fair-
trade Bakeoff.
Other oppurtunities to get in-
volved in FairtradeSoc this year in-
clude the Annual Fairtrade Univer-
sities Conference in Leeds on 9th
February and the Ethical Careers
Exhibition on the 21st February.
Membership of FairtradeSoc is
only £3pa and can be bought online
at www.imperialcollegeunion.org.
Your £3 will get you a free enamel
pin badge to wear with pride, dis-
counts or free entry to our events,
free tea coffee and chocolate at our
meetings and a chance to join the
committee.
We are currently looking for two
or three extra committee members
to help with publicity, web design
and event planning.
With Imperial entering it’s cen-
tenary year, and college announc-
ing it supports the application for
Imperial to become a Fairtrade in-
stitution, FairtradeSoc provides an
excellent opportunity to be involved
in the process which is making
change happen at Imperial College.

and how to get involved contact

son at kirsty.patterson@ic.ac.uk.
ICU Fairtrade society
IC Synchro is one of the latest clubs
to be created at Imperial. Since we
are new, we are looking for Imperial
students to join.
Why start synchronised
swimming?
Well, for starters, it is an excellent
form of exercise. Also, it is a water
sport so it is low impact on the joints.
Furthermore, we are a brand new
team, which means that there are
no expectations to live up to. Just
come, have a good time and try to
learn synchronised swimming! For
those that think it is really hard and
that they could never do it, that is
far from true. All one needs to be
able to do is float! (btw, fat floats!)
Flexibility, experience with water
sports are just little extras.
Synchronised swimming is hard
but no harder than any other sport.
It is just because it is so unconven-
tional that the difficulty becomes
more apparent. But it is also this
aspect of it that makes it so amaz-
ing, different and fascinating! I
hope at least a few of you are con-
vinced to join or to at least come to
a few sessions.
So, if you find yourself in the mid-
dle of the year and you just want to
start a new activity, why not start
with synchronised swimming? If
you have any questions please feel
free to send an email to dtb04@
ic.ac.uk.

Médecins Sans Frontières MSF
(Doctors Without Borders) is an
international humanitarian aid
organisation that provides emer-
gency medical assistance to popu-
lations in danger in more than 80
countries.
The Imperial Friends of MSF is a
support group of MSF and the soci-
ety welcomes medical students as
well as students from other facul-
ties. Our main aim is to fundraise
and raise awareness of MSF and its
activities.
No matter if you are an engineer-
ing, mathematics, or physics stu-
dent, you can still become actively
involved in one of our five projects/
teams; Collection, Merchandise,
Small events, MSF Talent Show
and MSF Walk. You will not be a
mere observer, instead, this is a
chance to be an integrate part of a
specific team and be able to actively
contribute. You will have responsi-
bilities within each team and your
actions will directly impact on the
success of each fundraising activity
and the success of our society as a
whole.
We also hope to encourage stu-
dents to consider MSF or likemind-
ed NGOs as a possible career post
graduation. Despite qualified doc-
tors, MSF also needs logisticians,
accountants, public health experts,
and epidemiologists etc. to carry
on the work they do so well. Thus
we will invite individuals who have
worked in the field to come and
share their experience.
Whether you like to take action
and get involved or simply meet
others from other courses, this is
something for you!
You can contact us at Friend-
sofmsf@gmail.com for more in-
formation. Membership fee is five
pounds and can be bought online at
www.imperialcollegeunion.org.
