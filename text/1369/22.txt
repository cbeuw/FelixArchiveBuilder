Complete the grid so that every
row, every column and every 5x5
square contains some of the letters
A to Z, in some order.
There is no ‘theme’ at work, but
keeping early 19th-century Russian
poets in mind will reveal a subtle
novelty, belied by the more flagrant
excesses of the bourgeoisie!
The down clues were constructed
in a happier frame of mind than the
up clues, but don’t let it worry you.
There are no penalties for wrong
answers, though credit will be
given for brave attempts. Credit
does not directly equate to a prize,
except when taken as the integer
part of a fraction.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
Your mother and I
are in love. I can’t
face telling you this in
person. I’m sorry you
had to find out this
way. It’s been going on
for a while... Remember that slee-
pover in 3rd Form? You fell asleep
in the middle of Home Alone. She
took me on your bunk-bed.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
Jesus fuck, appar-
ently this is supposed
to be some sort of
horrorscope rather
than bitesized chunks
of abuse. What sort
of mangy cunt came up with that
lame-assed idea? Ooooh, you’ll
meet a tall dark stranger, and will
go on a journey. To his coal-cellar.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
I hate you. It takes
every milligram of
my inner strength
to resist the urge to
stalk the rooms and
halls with an arsenal
of weaponry. I’m a nice person, but
you made me do this. I long to feel
the splatter of your blood against
the mask of my murderous smile.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
Vagina Dentata, what
a wonderful phrase.
Vagina Dentata, ain’t
no passin’ craze.
It means no organ, for
the rest of your days.
It’s our penis-free philosophy.
Vagina Dentata: it’s our motto.
“What’s a motto?”
Nothing, what’s a-motto with you?
This Week’s Pokey-pokes
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
Once upon a time
there was a small boy
named Billy who loved
nothing more than
to spend the endless
summer days running
through freshly cut meadows, skip-
ping over the small stream that
gurgled down by the hedge. He’s
dead now. No-one ever loved him.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
Insomnia begins to
take over your already
feeble existance. You
decide to embrace the
affliction and climb
to the top of Canary
Wharf to howl like a werewolf. Mi-
grating flying antelope wing their
way into the side of the building
and you fall to your demise.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
I bet you’re a twat.
I bet you stand still
in busy walkways. I
bet you talk loudly in
public spaces in order
to pretend to others
that you are a deity in the midst of
plebs. I bet you’ve spent hours cul-
tivating a your inane mannerisms.
I bet you’re terrified of dying alone.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
This week was a bad
one for you, wasn’t it?
It’s ok, you can tell
me. That bad, eh?
Cheer up, it might
never happen... Well,
I’m sure it’s not as bad as you
think. Every cloud, y’know? One
day you’ll look back and laugh.
‘Sides: fuck it! Knowhaddamean?
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
so anyway cumshot
who needs punctua-
tion and stuff this is
all just spewing out
coming straight out
like the gushing mon-
ey shot oh yeah hit me baby push it
real good this week you shrink by 6
inches and become the undefeated
limbo champion of hawaii rock on
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
This week you at-
tempt the “Shocker”.
The idea of two in the
pink, one in the stink
appeals to you. It’s
dark and upon going
to town with one in the brown suc-
cess is limited. Lights on: the ho is
dead and your fingerless hand is a
maroon-blooded mess. Pimp that.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
Has anyone seen
my lungs? I’m sure I
had them earlier, but
I can’t seem to find
them anywhere. At a
push, I could do with
a second-hand pair if any medics
need a quick buck. Non-smokers
only, please – I’d only just finished
bleaching the last pair.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
Exposition that
describes your
unfortunate recent
predicament. Obscure
or eventful journey of
some kind. Shocking,
gruesome, unrealistic or sensa-
tional resolution that ultimately
leads to your death or at the very
least: pain. Insult. Cock face.
