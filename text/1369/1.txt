No confidence
held up by
legal concerns
The no confidence motion against
the Deputy President (Graduate
Students), Shama Rahman, is be-
ing held up by concerns over the
legality of the evidence, and the le-
gality of the motion itself. Felix has
also been informed that a complaint
has been filed regarding last week’s
front page.
In what could become a lingering
mark on this year’s sabbatical team,
the motion was finally submitted to
the Union President with a number
of points reportedly struck from it
compared to the version seen by
this reporter last week.
John Collins, Union President,
immediately handed the motion
over to the newly-formed Union
Court for consideration, which was
briefed specially on the matter at
its formation. Ms Rahman also
wrote a detailed letter to the Court,
adding to the issues raised by the
President. However, the Court dis-
missed the claim by Miss Rahman
(amusingly referred to as “Sabb
D” in the Court’s report) that she
hadn’t had enough time to consider
the motion.

RSCU protest
losing new office
The RCSU (Royal College of Science Union) organised an im-
promptu protest outside the Blue Cube (Faculty Building) on
Dalby Court over the loss of a promised new office on the walk-
way. It drew the waves of numerous College high-ups from the
building, herded out of their offices by a somewhat irate John
Collins, the Union President. Pictured is the RCSU President,

tion is that the sabbs signed ‘proper’
employment contracts; this makes
them subject to the full protection
of employment law. This places
the Union in a difficult position, as
it becomes hard to remove a sabb
who is not performing satisfactorily
without much legal wrangling and
jumping through hoops. Other stu-
dent unions make their sabbaticals
sign performance agreementsMr
Collins has indicated that he feared
that, as a trustee of the Union, there
was a chance that he could be sub-
ject to prosecution and held person-
ally liable under employment law if
the motion was ever present to the
Union Council.
Ms Rahman’s letter to the Court
also contains a complaint about
the conduct of the Felix Editor, and
the way in which Felix reported the
motion, calling it “slanderous” and
that it “influences and biases deci-
sions taken by Council members
who would also have read this arti-
cle as it was aggressively marketed
(front page with half of it taken up
with my photo).” She also com-
plained that Felix obtained a leaked
draft copy of the motion, and that “I
was not given equal printed space
in this article.” Ms Rahman has
kindly offered to write a letter to Fe-
lix for the next issue to address her
problems with the article, and this
reporter will reply as fully as space
allows.
The Court has decided that the
motion should be suspended for the
time being, until it can meet again
to discuss the motion’s evidence in
more detail. Felix hopes this matter
will be resolved soon.

A no confidence motion may be submitted against the Deputy President (Graduate Students) next week
Felix has learnt that a no confidence
motion is likely to be submitted
against Shama Rahman, Deputy
President (Graduate Students), al-
leging that the sabb has misled Un-
ion Council, failed to work the hours
required by her contract among
other failings, and that her position
“has become untenable”.
Felix has obtained a leaked copy of
the draft paper, complete with high-
lights, that shows that almost all of
the Union’s Executive Committee
(excluding the sabbs themselves)
have seconded the motion, includ-
ing all of the Faculty Union Presi-
dents, a number of CSCs and other
senior Union officers. The Execu-
tive Committee is the second most
important body in the Union, and is
superseded only by the Council.
The document obtained by this
reporter is 34 pages long, and
contains numerous allegations of
misconduct, incompetence, and
breaches of Union regulations.
The paper was written by Jon Mat-
h s Deputy President (Finance
d Ms
made about her failure to handle
the welfare issues of PhD students
that had approached her; these
cases had to be handled by other
sabbs. It also describes her lack of
understanding of the issues facing
the various types of postgraduates,
such as PhD students, taught mas-
tersstudents,andresearchmasters
students. In one case, documented
by emails that were copied to Mr
Matthews by the student in ques-
tion, a query by a student about the
number of hours a week a non-EU
PhD student could legally work re-
mained unanswered for a month
before a staff member raised it with
Mr Matthews.
There are also numerous allega-
tions of lying to or misleading either
her colleagues or Council, backed
up with documentation. Felix has
seen emails, provided by an anony-
mous source, that suggest Ms Rah-
man may have ‘pulled a sickie’ in
order to take Friday off. This email
was sent only ten days after the
President, John Collins, sent Ms
Rahman a written formal warning
concerning her attendance and of-
fice hours, among other things.
Miss Rahman is also accused of
badly handling the budget for the
Christmas Ball, initially say-
d more than
tickets on credit without authorisa-
tion (also forbidden under Union
rules).
The paper describes how she
told Council she could not attend
QUARC (an important College
meeting for discussing education
quality issues) on 8 December be-
cause she was too busy rearrang-
ing the venue for the Ball. However,
this reporter has seen an invoice
for payment from the new venue,
which was signed off by a senior
Union staff member on the 6 De-
cember, confirming the new venue.
Ms Rahman says that she was still
confirming other details to do with
the venue change, and that a sec-
ond invoice exists which shows that
she had changed the booking.
She is also accused of misleading
Council over a visit to Clayponds.
She claims she went personally;
however, the paper contains an
email from the warden at Clay-
ponds that describes his dissatis-
faction with a late-notice cancella-
tion by Ms. Rahman, and her choice
of replacement.
There are many other accusa-
tions relating to the points above,
and it is not yet clear how much
will make it to the final report. Ms
Rahman was contacted by Felix to
provide comment: “In my defence,
I had a steep learning curve as I
