Sports Ambassadors
Are you a keen sports person? Interested in obtaining a coaching
qualification, enhancing your CV and passing on your sporting skills
to children in local schools?
The Sports Ambassadors Scheme gives you the opportunity to do all of
that whilst studying at Imperial, improving your overall student
experience.
“The Sports Ambassadors Scheme not only
gives students the opportunity to gain a
coaching qualiﬁcation and put it into practice,
but also to gain the added dimension of acting
as mentors and role models to HE
promoting themselves and the University to
local schools, community and beyond.”

“Volunteering has beneﬁtted both my rugby
and also my character. I have beneﬁtted from
coaching young children rugby through the
feeling of immense satisfaction of a job well
done for people who wanted the coaching. As
a result I am a more conﬁdent, patient,
creative, understanding, disciplined, attentive
and most importantly fun person to be around.”
