Why set up the Club?
One small step for Imperial Col-
lege, London, an impressive shim-
my for the Belly Dancing Club!
Asha Ashokan and Millie Dutt (both
fifth year medics) were keen to take
up classes in the formally known
‘Raqs Sharqi’ or oriental dance,
which is practised with many dif-
ferent styles in various parts of the
Middle East; Egypt, Lebanon, Tur-
key, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and
Morocco, to name but a few.
We were interested to learn
this very special artform
locally, with friends and staff from
across the University, and at an af-
fordable price, thus taking advan-
tage of Imperial’s encouragement
for the set-up of diverse recreation-
al clubs and societies.
Perhaps it was the spellbinding
control and graceful elegance that
dancers have while performing in-
tricate hip movements and muscle
isolations to music which mesmer-
ised us, maybe it was pure fascina-
tion with the exotic glamour of the
finely embroidered costumes, veils,
zills (cymbals) and other acces-
sories that, when worn, instantly
bring about the urge to celebrate
passion, creativity, and the small
recognised beauty that is being a
fine woman in our prestigious Uni-
versity that is heaving with male
students in a competitive, hard-
working, and undeniably stress-
ful environment! Together with
the support and dedication of Na-
bigha Mohyud-Din (Secretary) and
Kamaljeet Samra (Treasurer), they
set up the now blossoming ICU Bel-
ly Dancing Club.
The background to bellydancing
Earliest forms of the dance
may havehad aspiritualorreligious
context although it is generally be-
lieved to have roots in Middle East-
ern fertility ceremonies, a dance
performed for women by women to
strengthen the abdominal muscles
for the act of childbirth and also a
custom at many weddings. The art
of belly dancing is still traditional-
ly passed down from generation to
generation in some families simply
as rich female heritage.
The separate styles of the dance
range from the highly skilled and re-
fined Egyptian cabaret style, where
dancers are trained to execute
those wonderfully slight muscle
movements which we most of-
ten associate with the term “belly
dance,” or dramatic Lebanese cab-
aret with its dramatic and ballet in-
fluences, to softly refined classical
oriental dance which emerged from
the courts of the early Ottoman
Empire; from modestly dressed
Baladi (or folkloric dance) of rural
Egypt which also encompasses the
male Tahtib martial arts dance, the
gypsy style Ghawazee, to the Kha-
leeji of the Persian Gulf States and
Saudi Arabia with its distinctive
hair toss. And many more styles do
exist, not forgetting Turkish style
cabaret with it’s flamboyant, earthy
movements and, some may say, se-
ductive overtones.
With its introduction into global
media notably it is thought in the
19th century, the term ‘belly dance’
became inextricably linked with
sexual glamour and took on alter-
native meanings which were slight-
ly demeaning to the soulful beauty
of the danceform.
However, having travelled afar
and become a worldwide, con-
stantly evolving phenomenon,
the distinct cultural traditions of
belly dancing and its joyful ex-
pression are still largely retained
and respected; it continues to ap-
peal to the human spirit, and it is
also fun, excellent muscle-toning
exercise, and a great way of making
new friends!
It has recently gained much
popularity amongst us younger
generations via mainstream music
videos such as those of Shakira or
Beyonce, its image enduring for the
most part as a positive testimony to
beauty, strength, and grace, and all
things feminine.
What we do
The ICU Belly Dancing Club aims
to make this fantastically strong
artform accessible to all Impe-
rial College students (including our
men, provided there is sufficient
interest!), from every department,
background, or level of dancing
- and no experience is needed!
We already have superb, highly
experienced teachers and perform-
ers for our club and a Beginners
courseisrunningsuccessfullyinthe
Reynolds, Hammersmith, for which
there has been the highest demand
since our set-up in late November.
Over the first couple of lessons we
have already been covering isolated
upper and lower body movements,
arm movements, hip drops, a fluidly
elegant move known as ‘the camel’,
classic shimmies, back bends, and
more, with our lovely dance teach-
er Saffron! This month on 25th
January, ICU Belly Dancing will
be starting brand new classes in
Room 343, Huxley Building, South
Kensington, to cater for the over-
whelming demand for extra classes
across the college.
We have been fortunate in secur-
ing a particularly well-known danc-
er these classes; Krystina (Chris
Gould), who has trained impres-
sively in all types of Egyptian style
Belly Dance and has many years of
teaching experience for which she
has achieved distinctions with the
prestigious Josephine Wise Acade-
my of Arabic Dance. Her training in
Cairo with first-class professional
dancers and choreographers has
culminated in her becoming a truly
stunning dancer of our times, and
she will no doubt be able to give our
students an insight into the real es-
sence of the dance.
She has performed with the fabu-
lous dance company Massriat at
severalshows,whichthoseinterest-
ed in the danceform may well have
seen performing, she holds regular
classes, workshops and also has
her very own dance company that
perform with her at public events,
including the superb Fantasia
events in London. With her unique
blend of experience and traditional
dancing style, this course is go-
ing to be very special and unmiss-
able for all Imperial students and a
particular delight for those with an
interest in future performance and
choreography!
How to get involved
One course of 12 lessons, taking us
up to early May, will be available
at the unbeatable price of £29.00
only for club members, which can

merous events throughout the year
to look forward to for dance enthu-
siasts and those with pure interest
in the danceform.
In particular, some fantastic one-
day choreography workshops for
beginners/improvers will be held
throughout the year to quench our
students’ thirst for performance
and creativity! We will always aim
