his fat arse about at the taxpayers
expense so blatantly he’s not going

RCSU protest outside
The Royal College of Science Union
(RCSU), which represents students
at Imperial College on natural sci-
ence degrees, has found itself with-
out a suitable office after College
Estates decided to go back on a de-
cision to award them space on the
walkway.
Students walking across Dalby
Court on Tuesday morning were
greeted with the sight of the entire
RCSU executive, plus hangers-on,
camped outside the Faculty Build-
ing with a sofa, desk, computer, and
fax machine. Also present in an of-
ficial capacity were John Collins
(Union President), Jon Matthews
(Deputy President, Finance &
Services), and Ben Harris (Deputy
President, Education & Welfare).
The current RCSU ‘office’ is locat-
ed in the Blacklett Lab entrance, in
the seating area. The RCSU Presi-
dent, Jad Marrouche, has referred
to it as “a cupboard”. They also
have some space in the Sir Alex-
ander Fleming building. The other
two faculty unions (CGCU, repre-
senting engineers, and ICSMSU,
College Estates go back on a decision to give the RCSU a new
office on the walkway instead of their “broom cupboard”
representing medics) both have
sizable offices close to the students
they are representing.
Before the Christmas break, the
RCSU were shown two locations
as possible new offices to replace
the space they currently have. The
first was the old print shop on the
walkway, which has recently been
vacated.
The second was in Princes Gate,
on the other side of Exhibition
Road. The room is currently be-
ing used as “temporary storage for
cleaners”, possibly College-speak
for a broom cupboard.
Naturally, the RCSU executive
preferred the room on the walkway,
which is close to their students,
and sizable. The proposed space
in Princes Gate is reported to be
in bad condition, as is the access
route. Additionally, the office is far
out of the way.
It seemed that an agreement had
been reached that the RCSU could
have the space on the walkway,
with Estates staff sending an email
reading: “This space was used by
commercial tenants and I shall in-
form you when the legal issues for
the transfer of the space are final-

The assembled throng, complete with office furniture, couches, and semi-functional computer
College staff have expressed con-
cerns about the pricing of access to
the new Ethos sports centre.
Initially, the sports centre was
available for use by everyone, staff
and students, for free - this was
thanks to money ‘left over’ from the
construction, obtained from vari-
ous funding bodies including the
National Lottery. Staff, however,
are finding the new Ethos pricing
scheme unwieldy. In order to use
the building, they must pay an an-
nual cost of £216 which is taken from
their salaries on a monthly basis.
This suits staff who use the centre
frequently, but has upset a number
of staff that use the sports centre on
a more casual basis. Without paying
the annual fee, there is no way they
can use the facilities, as no ‘pay as
you go’ system exists.
Members of staff that contacted
Felix have used the example of de-
partmental football games. These
are often organised on a purely cas-
ual basis, with a fee being paid for
the hire of one of the courts to play
on. However, with the new system,
any member of staff who wishes
to play, even if they only play once
a year, must pay the full £216 fee.
This also means that the staff will
pay Ethos twice; once for the hire
of the room, and once more for the
right to use the facilities.
Staff upset at new
Ethos pricing
One member of staff who spoke to
Felix commented: “We have always
anticipated having to pay for use of
the sports centre once the free pe-
riod was over.” He went on to ques-
tion the logic of forcing any staff
member who wants to use the facil-
ity, even if only on a casual basis, to
pay £216, saying: “If I only swim a
few times a year, it is an awful lot.”
There are also concerns how this
will impact members of College
staff who are on minimum wage.
Felix contacted Neil Mosley, Head
of Sport Imperial, for comment.
“When we looked at a suitable
charging policy for the new Cen-
tre one of our major objectives was
to provide value to money to staff
by minimizing the administrative
costs of collecting any fees.
I am sure you will agree that
£18 per month for unlimited use of
a very modern gym and pool for a
keep fit enthusiast represents ter-
rific value and over 400 staff have
now signed up as members of Club
Imperial. Having said that I recog-
nise that the one group that have
been affected are occasional swim-
mers.” He added: “we will be look-
ing at pool use and seeing if we can
incorporate a scheme for occasion-
al use. If we are able to make such a
move we will ensure that it is widely
publicised.”
ised so that you can start moving
your equipment.”
However, it appears Estates had
second thoughts. At a meeting of
the esoterically named “Space Ex-
ecutive”, College decided to allo-
cate the basement space in Princes
Gate to the RCSU, and to give the
walkway room to ICT, who man-
age the computer systems for the
College.
The protest was organised af-
ter pleas for the decision to be re-
versed fell on deaf ears. Though the
Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, was not
present as he is out of the country,
a number of key College officials
came to the windows of the Blue
Cube to wave at the protesters be-
low. These included Tony Mitch-
eson (College Secretary), Martin
Knight (Faculty of Natural Science
Principal), and Chris Towler (who
chaired the meeting where the de-
cision was made). Mr Towler came
down later to talk to the protesters.
The Deputy Rector, Professor
Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, stopped
to chat amicably with the assem-
bled students on his way to lunch,
though he stopped short of signing
the paper petition.
