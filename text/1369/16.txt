Game designers don’t need to be
C++’ing in their sleep to get going,
even though future success almost
always means long nights of pro-
gramming. Getting started can be
simple if you’ve got some ideas, and
you’re not expecting to emerge with
the Next Big Thing straight away.
The best way to start is often with
modding. Source, the technology
that powers Half-Life 2 and many
other games, has a downloadable
Development Kit (http://steam-
powered.com) that allows you to
tinker with and build all manner of
creations.
Half-Life 2 modifications are be-
coming easier and easier to make,
and there are plenty of projects that
you can help out with online to gain
some experience. GamesMod-
ding (http://gamesmodding.com)
wouldn’t be a bad place to start
looking.
If that all sounds a bit program-
ming-heavy, Flash games can be
easier to get to grips with. The soft-
ware isn’t free, but you can down-
load a free trial of Flash MX from
Apple’s website (http://www.adobe.
com/products). Flash games are
everywhere on the internet thanks
to their often bright visuals and
portability.
They’re also a good place to start
if your art is stronger than your
coding. Flash makes it easy to work
with your graphics, and helps with
coding interactions and movement.
There’s a wealth of help online, as
well - Adobe’s own website is just
one of a host of development and
tutorial hubs (http://www.adobe.
com/devnet).
If you’re a fan of point-and-click
adventure games, then the best
tool available is probably Adven-
ture Game Studio (http://tinyurl.
com/y723jk) which requires no pro-
gramming knowledge at first, and Current Indie superstars: the classic 5 Days A Stranger, bottom, and the addictive Line Rider, top
very little to do the more compli-
cated things.
AGS has spawned some popular
conversions of old games such as
King’s Quest as well as gems of its
own, like 5 Days A Stranger. With
some weak MS Paint skills, we
made a two-puzzle game in a cou-
ple of hours - with time and dedica-
tion, the results can be impressive.
But it can get even easier. If you
want to get a feel for designing a
whole package, but aren’t looking
to churn out a CounterStrike beater
just yet, Klik and Play (http://tiny-
url.com/y24rwz ) offers a friendly
development platform - for free.
It’s very low-tech, and you’ll soon
find yourself wanting something
more powerful, but it’s a fun pack-
age that quickly gives results back.
It only takes an hour or so to bash
out a platformer with the supplied
libraries and tutorials.
Simpler still is making your own
text-based adventure game. All
that’s required is a lot of time and
someimagination-somethingthat’ll
be needed anyway if you’re going
to get into development. There’s a
lot of kits to choose from, but Text-
World (http://tinyurl.com/ujd4z) is
a good start, having the added bo-
nus of being free of charge.
The important thing is to get out
there and experiment. The first
games you’ll make probably won’t
be commercial quality, but getting
your hands dirty is great experi-
ence, and once you’ve started off
you’ll find it easier to progress, to
build teams, and to dedicate your-
self to larger projects.
Introversion, and many others,
have shown that it’s possible, and
most of the industry is looking at
talented gamers for innovation in
the next decade. That dream of de-
signing might not be as far off as
you think, if you give it a go...
What now? The next steps for Indie wannabes
sit up and take notice, which also
probably explains why we’ve had so
much exposure and coverage with
our latest game, DEFCON.
You recently gave a talk about
independent games creation as a
force for the future. Is this where
innovation lies, in the hands of the
developers? Or is it more in the
hands of the publishers, and their
willingness to take chances?
I think innovation relies on both
sides of the industry, a desire
amongst developers to create
unique titles and a willingness on
the side of the publishers to take
risks by taking them on. Independ-
ents are often seen as the maver-
icks of the game industry because
they’re usually braver when it
comes to trying something new, es-
pecially if they self-publish and own
their own IPs.
At Introversion we don’t do any
market research before we create a
game; ideas just occur pretty ran-
domly, inspired by something that
interests us so it’s a pretty hap-
hazard process. The trouble with
the industry today is that publish-
ers have a cookie cutter approach
to making games; they look at the
games already in the market, de-
cide which ones seem to be sell-
ing particularly well and then get
a developer to make another spin-
off. In this scenario, the developer
has very little creative control and
games are made purely with prof-
its in mind so no wonder we end up
with hundreds of identical first-per-
son shooters!
What made you decide to partner
with Steam for the distribution of
some of your games? Do you think
this changed people’s perception
of Introversion?
Retail wasn’t really working out so
well for us – Darwinia was gaining
great reviews but this wasn’t really
translating into particularly impres-
sive sales. Part of that was perhaps
due to the comparative inaccessi-
bility of Darwinia when we first re-
leased it; it was incredibly difficult
to market because it was such a
complicated game to explain.
We adapted it quite a lot after its
first release to make it more user-
friendly, changing the gesture con-
trol mechanism and making anoth-
er demo which showed Darwinia
off to its full potential. After these
improvements were made, we
managed to get a deal with Valve to
launch on Steam and prospects be-
came significantly brighter for the
company after that.
We sold more copies of Darwinia
in the first 3 weeks of selling via
Steam than we’d managed in the
whole prior 6 month period selling
via retail and our online store.
Would Steam only work for grow-
ing companies such as Introver-
sion? Or do you see it as a plat-
form for all levels of developers in
the future? Could this be the sort
of system that gives indie devel-
opment a helping hand?
Digital distribution channels such
as Steam are ideal for independ-
ents; not only do you get a higher
return on your product but you’re
also much more likely to have your
game accepted for digital distribu-
tion than for retail, especially if it’s
an off-the-wall concept because the
financial risks of releasing digitally
are significantly lower. Digital dis-
tribution is also ideally suited to the
kind of smaller titles that independ-
ents release – DEFCON was only 60
Mb so, perfect for online download.
Do you still have hope for the fu-
ture of the industry? Has it still got
life and invention left in it?
I think the games industry has gone
through a bit of a rough patch over
the past few years but there does
seem to have been a bit of a back-
lash, certainly in the press, against
some of the endless sequels and
franchises. I don’t believe we would
still be here doing what we do if
there wasn’t at least a market for
the kind of games we make and a
desire to try something new.

Navigating PR, the world of inde-

overrun hasn’t been easy, and In-
troversion’s balance between finan-
cial gain and creative vision has al-
lowed them to retain all of their IPs
to this date.
“When we finally got to see
Chris’s game [Uplink] we realised
it was good enough to sell; we gave
up university beer for a couple of
weeks, threw in £200 each and set
up a store online.”
A bitter sacrifice, but a good one.
