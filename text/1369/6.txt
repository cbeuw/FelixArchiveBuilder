An ode to Ken Livingstone
L
et me share with you the
truth about Ken Living-
stone (Mayor of London)
because to be fair, not
enough people know why
thismanissuchacuntanddeserves
such absolute hatred. I’m going to
focus mainly on the bastard that is
Ken purely because I feel that by
now most people know Tony Blair
is a downright fool but some ignora-
muses have mixed opinions on Ken
whereby some think he’s a legend.
and it needs to be homed into your
heads why this man is such a tool.
Ken has no fucking clue what he is
doing…first of all, his sense of iden-
tity is totally fucked up and lack-
ing (like his hair and good looks)
He claims he is “moderate” (in my
opinion he is more of an extreme
socialist bordering on communist)
but he does the stupid thing of coyly
raising the price of public transport
to such an extent that sometimes
you think he is trying to screw the
last shred of money out of all those
poor souls who are far from well off.
What the fuck is he doing? Serious-
ly, £4 for a single journey is ridicu-
lous. Is he having a laugh?
Obviously the little twat is fucking
happy to do this because he doesn’t
suffer. Of course not, the cheeky
fucker ponces around and flounces
his fat arse about at the taxpayers
In the past few years the Mayor of London has stood accused of making racist remarks, and is a polarising
figure in London politics. Kat Fu vents her spleen on the subject of transport, politics, and traffic wardens
expense so blatantly he’s not go-
ing to complain. I’d love to see the
day he gets a normal oyster card,
tops it up with £20 (which to some
of us, namely students, unwealthy
people, stingy rich people, is a LOT
of money) and see it get used up
within a few days. Yes I’d love to
see his face if that day ever came,
his tiny slitty eyes screwing up and
becoming even smaller than they
already are if that is even possible?
I’m imagining it to myself now (its
not a pretty sight so actually, I’d
rather not see his face). I’d rather
he just do everyone a big favour and
lower the fucking prices of public
transport which I feel cant really be
deemed public anymore because
there are fuck loads of citizens who
find themselves unable to pay for
the extreme and extortionate cost.
Totally going off on one here, but
if you have a sneaky little peak at
pictures of Ken, you can see that he
has progressively gone from skin-
ny to a little chubby to now full on
lardy. In my opinion this is due not
only to the fact that he is so fucking
smug that he can pass any law and
get away with it, but also his incred-
ible ability to sponge off all the free
food and alcohol that he gets during
meetings. Labour is so fucking sly.
They claim to be all eco friendly but
how seriously can we take all this
I
n this society of multicultur-
alism and globalization, what
will become the meaning of
nationality, what is the im-
portance? And to what extent
does it define us and your life?
These questions arose to me
when I was browsing to through the
news from websites back home. As
most of you probably don’t know, the
mayoral elections are taking place
in Taiwan, and as all of you know, as
all elections go, that is a time for po-
litical opponents to diss each other
by any conceivable means. Despite
the increase in constructive policy
debates, and city plans, candidates
in this new democracy still find it
irresistible to reveal other candi-
dates’ dirty laundry.
I’ve seen them all. And I am glad
thattacticssuchasmedicalrecords,
unfulfilled military obligation of
candidate’s children, tax avoidance
to mistresses, don’t effect the pub-
lic decision anymore; a good indica-
tion of the development of the pub-
lic resistance to stupid attacks (a
mayor with cancer can still govern
well, you know!) However, a recent
development has truly shocked me:
the nationality of not the candidate,
but the child and grandchild of the
candidate.
I find it stupid that people are
concerned whether the mayor’s
daughter renounces her American
nationality, I find it disgusting that
pressure is place upon the Presi-
dent’s daughter in law to give birth
on Taiwanese soil (she’s studying
in the US at the moment), and I
don’t understand why the previous
Premier had to recall his son form
a foreign country, resulting in him
abandoning his lifestyle and per-
haps career or education, to win the
support of the public.
And I ask, why do people care?
Does the fact that I’m living in Lon-
don, make my father a less capable
person to run for office? Or the fact
that our President is a grandpa of
an American makes him less re-
liable? I am truly baffled at this.
Can’t people see that Sonia Gandhi,
albeit being Italian to the bone, is
participating in India’s National
Congress? Don’t these people see
that the Dutch welcomed that fact
that they will have an Argentinean
Queen? Or that the British Royal
Family is partly German?
I ask myself whether it’s the fact
Asia isn’t as international as Eu-
rope? Or are the Asians more na-
tionalistic and resist the acceptance
of an international community? As
an Asian person brought up in a
Western World, I am paradoxically
unable to answer this question, as
my father puts it “you don’t under-
stand the public sentiment of the
people in Taiwan” (basically “My
son, you’re not Taiwanese”)
One month after writing the previ-
ous part, I visited the Tate Modern
on the penultimate day of the year.
There was an installation entitled
Pacific by a Yukinori Yanagi.
Normally I’m not a modern artist
sort of guy, I confessed I don’t get
and can’t appreciate most of the art
in Tate Modern; however this in-
stallation really struck a cord with
me.
It was 49 glass panes with col-
oured sand trapped in it, the col-
oured sand formed the flags of
49 nations; all the flags were con-
nected with the glass adjacent to
it with a glass straw. We are told
that the artist, having prepared
this, released thousands of ants
into the installation. The ants went
Is nationality still a relevant concept today?
sanctimonious eco-waffle from the
government with John “2-Jags”
Prescott belching out CO2 in addi-
tion to all the methane emitted by
that overfed fat prick of a Mayor we
have?
Another beast of an issue that
needs to be raised is the topic of
how to get rid of the cunts that
are otherwise known as clampers/
traffic wardens/cretins/saps/twats/
pussys/morosophs/buffoons/mug-
gers/clowns/bozos/flibbertigibbets.
Lets take the necessary urgent
action against these simpletons
by eliminating them one by one.
Let’s bugger the fuck out of them!
Lets face it they deserve it! They’ve
fucked so many people over includ-
ing me (many a time). I quote from
Kat Fu
Valerio Chang
a little something I wrote once upon
a time: “can that fucker Ken maybe
think about employing traffic war-
dens and clampers that can actu-
ally READ? My car was clamped
on a Sunday when the sign next to
it clearly said the restrictions were
for Monday to Saturday? Sunday
was not mentioned at all.” Due to
such troglodyte, knuckle-dragging
incompetence from these so-called
“public servants” I offer the pos-
tulate that these people are less
evolved than the rest of us.
I am fed up with this govern-
ment. What is the point of throwing
money at the NHS when they cause
me and so many others to get an-
gry and develop a variety of health
defects that will require expensive
treatments we wouldn’t have other-
wise have needed?
Coronary heart disease, severe
hypertension, rapid heart palpi-
tations, shooting crushing chest
pains, early dementia, parkinsons
(due to all the irrationality that is
going on in this nation), strokes, all
caused by the cunting Labour party.
Seriously now, what the fuck? Give
us a break guys. Our faces already
go fucking red with alcohol, give us
a chance of looking normal at other
sober times! Especially you Ken,
fucker! Get on the treadmill you fat
turd.

“Where you

in and carved and nibbled through
the sand as if one was observing a
elementary school ant farm. The
description went on to explain that
the ants represented the popula-
tion, and the flags representing the
idea of nation state, and how the
interlinking – movement of people
of different countries is slowly chal-
lenging and disintegrating the solid
notion of a homogenous/solitary
nation.
I really identified with what the
artist wished to express, at the core
where your born shouldn’t matter,
and that we are all part of one big
world.
