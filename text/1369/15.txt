I
designed a game once. It was
called “Warbug: Ants of Des-
tiny”, partly because subtitles
were in fashion at the time,
but mostly because I was
nine and it sounded right. It was
a sizzling blend of Command and
Conquer and SimAnt, with a twist
of primary school humour and the
kind of plot that a straight-to-Dis-
ney-Channel movie would be proud
of. One day, I promised myself, that
game would get made.
A decade on, and I’ve still not
had use for my promotional clock
designs (with clockwork thorax
action!tm
). In fact, I’m beginning
to wonder whether I ever will, not
least because the market for insect-
based isometric strategy games is
smaller than I thought, but also be-
cause the games industry can seem
pretty daunting for One Man and
His Keyboard.
The picture does generally seem
to be a dark one – production costs
are soaring, and demand for com-
plex graphical systems is huge. In
short, you need to spend money to
make money – and it’s the kind of
money that your average Indie de-
veloper doesn’t have.
But hope hasn’t been given up yet
– in fact, it could be the best time
yet to break into a fast-expand-
ing industry. That’s the message
that’s been given by a collection
of supporters and success stories
from the Indie scene, in a series
of internet addresses under the
title “So You Want To Be An Indie
Developer?”
The posts ranged from the light-
hearted to the serious, all of them
offering tips and advice on breaking
into a competitive, yet rewarding
industry. One of the contributors

Michael Cook asks if it’s too late to break into indie game development and Introversion answer
Simplicity In Blue – Introversion’s post-apocalyptic strategy game DEFCON is their third game and an example of their pure design philosophy. It’s also unsettlingly foreboding
to the group was Introversion, the
self-titled “last of the bedroom cod-
ers”, and acclaimed breakthrough
coders of Uplink, Darwinia and
DEFCON.
“Publishers often have a cookie
cutter approach to making game
... so no wonder we end up with
hundreds of identical first-person
shooters.” explains Tom Arundel
in a news post on their website,
“That’s where the independent
steps in.”
It’s true that good design isn’t
something that money makes
easier – and talent in that respect
will always play well with gamers.
“Keep it simple.” Tom says, “Don’t
feel you have to compete with the
bigger developers ... in photore-
alistic graphics and physics, you
can’t.”
Introversion’s latest work, DE-
FCON, is a testament to simple
design, and it’s this cut-down, at-
mospheric feel that won over the
gaming world again. Tom spoke to
Felix about Introversion’s rise to
fame, and the reality of the future of
Indie development.
Towards the end of Tom’s post in
the “Indie Developer” news piece,
he mentions the freedom given by
independent development. But the
last piece of advice is perhaps the
most important – “the only way
you’ll ever be able to make the
games milling around in your head,
is by becoming an indie developer.”
Whether you’re optimistic about
the future, or don’t think you’d have
a chance, the only way to find out
is to get out there and start coding,
and there’s no time like the present.
But don’t think you can take Warbug
away from me. We’re going places.
Onwards to the interview:
The original team has been to-
gether for almost ten years now.
What was the defining moment in
the rise of Introversion?
I think without a doubt, winning
three awards at this year’s Inde-
pendent Games Festival for Dar-
winia was the biggest highlight
yet for Introversion. We had really
struggled during the development
of Darwinia, the project over-ran by
over a year, so financially we weren’t
in great shape, and morale was also
running pretty low in the company
by this point. Those awards finally
made all the blood, sweat and tears
seem worth it and it’s amazing how
much that event has positively re-
defined this year for us. We gained
an enormous amount of exposure
and credibility off the back of those
awards and opportunities are pop-
ping up even now which I think are
as a direct result of IGF.
Where did you find you struggled
most? Did the biggest challenges
lie with competing in terms of
manpower or technology, or was
the difficulty more in terms of get-
ting noticed, getting seen?
To be honest, I think really a mix-
ture of both. There are massive
logistical issues to solve when you
set up a computer games com-
pany in terms of financing and ob-
taining enough resources to get
started. Generally speaking, one
of the biggest issues is you don’t
have the time or the manpower to
attempt certain types of games. It
also means we struggle to produce
content; for example a number of
reviews said that Darwinia was too
short but it had taken us 3 years to
produce a game with 10 levels!
The second major issue is that
publishers aren’t really interested
– that’s the bottom line and it can
be a real struggle to get yourselves
noticed and taken seriously. When
Darwinia released, we were big
enough to self publish in the UK,
but the US market is around ten
times larger and we just didn’t have
the staff. It took a success story like
the Darwinia launch on Steam and
winning at IGF for publishers to
