Get fit and socialise with Pilates
Pilates is more than just exercise!
It is a sport that increases the
strength of your inner core muscles
and helps balance and stability. It
also helps with easing some of those
aches and pains caused by under
or over-use of muscles. If Pilates
is practised regularly a number of
benefits can be found in the body in-
cluding increased lung capacity and
circulation, strength and flexibility,
particularly the abdomen and back
muscles, and muscular/mental co-
ordination. Bone density and the
health of bones can also improve,
and many experience positive body
awareness for the first time. Pilates
teaches balance and control of the
body, and that capacity spills over
into other areas of one’s life.
Why was ICMSU Pilates set up?
Pilates has become increasingly
popular over the years as many
sports-professionals and recrea-
tional enthusisats reap the rewards
from practising pilates regularly.
Due to the popularity, pilates is
becoming increasingly expensive
to attend sessions. Therefore, we
wanted to set up cheap pilates
sessions with a qualified Pilates
instructor and to have the classes
in the evenings, so it is more ben-
eficial for students who are not on
campus during the lunchtimes or
are on different campuses. ICMSU
pilates welcomes all Imperial stu-
dents to attend!
Committee members
The society was set up by Rebecca
Llewellyn. Deputy-President is
Ravneet Sirha, Secretary - Luxme
Nadarajah and Treasurer is Nis-
hanthy Ranganathan. (All 5th year
Medics).
Time and Venue
Music Room in the Reynolds every
Wednesday at 6.45pm. If there is
more demand for pilates, a 2nd
class will be organised so please
get in contact!

BackgammonSoc
The Backgammon Society is for
those who play the game or just
wanting to find out more about the
game. The club shall be acquiring
a few sets of backgammon and we
should ideally be holding bi-weekly,
if not weekly meetings for people to
have a few games and have a bit of
banter etc.
Backgammon is a great game of
probability, strategy and skills. It
has very simple rules that anyone
can learn within 5 minutes and
also offer a chance for them to beat
an experienced player in a one off
game as the game depends partly
on the roll of the dice. It is particu-
larly suitable for the largely numer-
ically competent students of Impe-
rial College.
The main aim for the rest of the
year is to find a core set of mem-
bers and perhaps someone who is
willing to take it on for next year.
People can sign up through the
union website for a nominal fee of
£1. If you’re interesing send your
queries to christopher.hong@impe-
rial.ac.uk since we haven’t got our
fancy backgammon@ic address
yet! I look forward to hearing from
you soon.
