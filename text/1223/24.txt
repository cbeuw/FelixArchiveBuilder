ERASMUS Take The Cup
On a cold winter's morning 16
teams descended on Hackney
to vie for glory in the Overseas
Students' Committee (OSC) 5-a-
side football tournament.
Luckily Jack Frost had no say as
the competition took place
indoors at the beautiful Space
Leisure Centre and no team
could afford to be "spaced out"
as each of the four groups was
as tough as the next.
Hot favourites Sikh Soc were
the first to stamp their authori-
ty on proceedings with a
thumping 8-3 victory i n the
very first game, if variety is the
spice of life then this contest
was to be a Real Masala. ERAS-
MUS too, one of the newest
additions to the OSC group,
were looking strong blending
football styles from across
Europe to dazzling effect.
Towards the end of the group
stage things were reaching
boiling point, with everyone
fighting tooth and nail for a cov-
eted spot in the quarterfinals.
Surprise team of the Cup were
undoubtedly Thai Soc whose
intricate passing and lighting
speed saw them all the way to
the semis.
Little praise could be given to
the OSC Exec team; they were
described by some as being in
the midst of a "Manchester
United style" crisis. Having
assembled an all-star line up,
including three of last year's
Afro Caribbean Society win-
ners, a series of ludicrous errors
a la Messers Barthez and Cole
meant that going into their last
game they were without a
point. Only a last minute 1-0
winner against Indian Soc
saved their blushes as both
crashed out.
A n d so after much delicious
soccer, the last 4 teams still
standing were ERASMUS, Thai
Soc, Sikh Soc and Turkish
Society - the real dark horses of
the tournament. The first semi
Wrestlemania
This winter s a w the brave
members of the Imperial
College Mixed M u d Wrestling
Team (ICMMWT) intrepidly
setting out into the arctic
wastes of North Wales to
engage in combat on the peak
of Snowdon, where they were
to obliterate all opposition to
gain the title of 'Dirtiest Little
Monkeys In The World'.
This was no easy task, how-
ever, having to take on the
cream of the world's crop of
mud wrestlers, but one that
the I C M M W T faced with guts
and determination.
The first bout saw Lindsey
'Dirty' Brookes taking on Fai
Chun 'Hu-Lang' Jones, where
they tussled in the deep, deep
mud, vying for that fatal
moment w h e n they could
strike the killing blow, and
render the other one topless.
Using a cunning manoeuvre
learnt i n 'Nam, Lindsey soon
got the upper hand, ripping
the flimsy fabric of her oppo-
nent's bodice asunder like so
much moist tissue paper.
The next round saw James
'Dirty Dirty' Saffin demolish
poor Odin 'Dirty Dirty Dirty'
Watts, for another 8 points to
the ICMMWT, and this lead
was built upon b y Penny
'Filthy, Dirty, Filthy, Little
Monkey' Moomin, whose top-
ripping technique was unsur-
passed, bringing the rather
muddy cup back home. Where
can w e go from here, but
down? Into the mud...
saw Sikh Soc thrash the Thais
4-0 (including a blistering hat-
trick from Player of the
Tournament - Parveiz Petkar)
leaving Sikh 'keeper Stuart
"Singh" Coleman without hav-
ing to make a save.
The second semi saw ERAS-
MUS continuing with their solid
brand of football to grind out a
2-0 victory over the decidedly
frustrated Turkish side. A n d so
the final saw ERASMUS line up
against the as-yet-unbeaten
Sikh Soc team.
The third-fourth play-off was
naturally a low-key affair with
the tired looking Thai side
going down 3-0. This left all
eyes focused on Court 1 for the
Grande Finale where much
was expected of the two final-
ists; and neither failed to disap-
point. Both teams shook of their
tiredness to contest the match
of the tournament. Sikh Soc,
despite not having any substi-
tutes for the whole competition
gave as good as they got and
responded with a cracking
equaliser having gone 1-0
down.
ERASMUS though left a little in
reserve going ahead with two
classic strikes, which would
not look out of place in next
summers World C u p in
Japan/South Korea. They
weathered late pressure from
the Sikh side well surviving a
last minute disallowed equalis-
er and the tantrums of Sikh Live
Wire Vishaal Chhatralia (EE2)
eventually running out 3-2 win-
ners and champions of the tour-
nament.
The real winner in this affair
was the OSC, celebrating their
largest ever sporting event and
providing high expectations for
next year's contest as well as
for International Night (Feb 7th
) - a celebration of the many
overseas cultures at ICU - see
you there!
