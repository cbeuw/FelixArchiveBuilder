No Offence Meant
The Commemoration Day
arrangements both at IC and
R A H were excellent and
absolutely first class; all those
involved should be congratu-
lated; we all left with our pos-
itive feelings about IC
enhanced and reinforced.
My criticism was solely
directed at the Success
Photography's 'studio' photo-
graphs of the graduates which
could have been better with a
slightly more contrasting
background, something the
photographers should make a
note of for the future.

L E Q Trouble
Hiya,
Here's my very brief account
of using the ill-fated LEQs. I
download my email at home
and received a message with
my L E Q username and pass-
word.
Fair enough I thought,
clicked on the link and., oh! I
couldn't access the site from
home, only internal IC IP num-
bers were allowed. The next
time I used a computer in my
department I couldn't remem-
ber the password I was given
because it was stored in my
inbox at home. Could I be
arsed to go home and write it
down? I think you know the
answer to that. Every single
secure online I need to access
at IC is done through one user-
name and password, from
checking email to registering
course options! Why some-
thing so important could be
done with the usual password
and something so seemingly
frivolous would have to have
its own is beyond me.
But then what do I care? I'll
be miles away from here in six
months time.

Tease? Me?
M y dearest William,
Are you ever planning to run
your much-anticipated "multi-
ple-choice, decide-my-fate
editorial thing"? You've been
hinting at it all term, and quite
frankly I think that it's time to
put your money where your
mouth is, as it were.
Or have your hints merely
been an elaborate double
bluff? Is your repeated prom-
ise of imminent fulfilment just
a cruel reworking of the clas-
sic "how to keep an idiot in
suspense" line?
Do tell.
G :op
Well, Mr. G :op (if that's your
real name), I think you are cor-
rect in demanding an explana-
tion. I had intended, as many
of you may have sussed, to
have a 'guess you own adven-
ture' editorial, where I would
provide options, and the pun-
ters would write in to tell me
what to do with my life.
Usually, admittedly, with refer-
ence to sex.
While this was a lovely idea,
no-one seemed even remotely
interested in the idea, and if
only four people wrote in hav-
ing decided I should make love
to a small rhino, then I could
have been in trouble. The
added crisis of actually landing
myself a girlfriend merely com-
pounded the situation, and as
such I'm not sure how interest-
ing it would be to ask 'Should I
take her out to dinner, go to
the pub, shag her senseless, or
pull her sister'. Well, it might
be interesting, but pointless.
The answer would clearly be
go to the pub.
So you see, Mr. G, my conun-
drum, and while I am tempted
to dump her, and have a laugh
on all of your behalfs, and at
my expense, I think I'll stick
with sex, thank you.
Sorry to disappoint.
One Ring to Bind...
Dear Will
You are in great danger. The
evil rector Sykeon is building
an army to try and take your
condom collection. You must
take your condom collection,
over bog and over dell, stop-
ping regularly to eat great
feasts, and destroy your con-
dom collection in the
wretched fires of ICT (the com-
puting service). Your condom
collection is a source of great
power and you must destroy it
before the evil rector has a
chance to take it using his evil
wenches from the student
finance office. (Sounds good to
me, Ed.) With the condom col-
lection he would be able to
rule Imperial and all CCU's, as
they would unable to resist his
mighty and evil power. A
great shadow is falling over
this once great land and it is
upon your meagre shoulders
to save humanity.
I will always be in your mind
as a guide on this great jour-
ney which you are going to
undertake. God bless you.

A n d Finally...
Felix,
What are you on? I have
never read such large chunks
of vomitous nonsense in my
life. Why do you waste stu-
dent money with this twad-
dle? Is there a point? If I were
in any position of power, I
would instantly have you
removed from this position.
You are meant to represent the
student voice, as well as
reporting what is relevant to
the students, and to an extent,
even to the professors. A n d
what happens? You just sit
there writing letter to yourself,
whining: 'No-one else ever
writes anything'. Bollocks.
