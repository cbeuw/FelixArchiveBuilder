Fklix w a s unable to obtain any
comments from senior sources
on this seeming discrepancy.
In the central sports strate-
gy, IC aims to provide suffi-
cient sporting facilities for stu-
dents and staff, in order to pro-
mote participation and sport-
ing excellence, since many
students and college members
believe that at the current time
our sports facilities are inferior
to those of our major institu-
tional competitors.
Initially, it w a s thought that
money would be re-diverted
back in to the college sports
facilities, by providing the final
balance for the extension of
the Sports Centre at Princes
Gardens. However, the College
Strategic Plan may suggest
otherwise, mentioning
Teddington in an area of the
report that is completely unre-
lated to sport: the building of
new residential buildings on
the tennis courts in Prince's
Gardens. This same part of the
plan also suggest that college
hope to have 'disposed o f
Teddington by the middle of
this year. Nonetheless
Felix has been assured that the
new sports hall project will go
ahead, while it remains uncer-
tain where this capital will
come from if no sale is made.
Without planning permis-
sion for the ground itself, the
sale would not really be worth
the effort and controversy, but
whether they will get permis-
sion remains to be seen.
Richmond Council regard this
sports field as "land of town-
scape importance" which is
therefore to be preserved and
the local residents are certain
to object to the development.
However, it is thought that, to
minimise this, the develop-
ment will only consume part of
the sports field for housing,
leaving an open recreational
area which will be available for
public use.
It is anticipated that a public
enquiry will be called before
planning permission is grant-
ed, at which time local resi-
dents and students can view
the proposals and voice their
opinions, but there is no w a y of
predicting when this will be
until the planning application
is submitted.
Unsurprisingly, most medics
are upset by the proposals.
Aside from the question of 70
years of tradition, the major
argument against the develop-
ment of these grounds is the
superior quality of the land,
Teddington being regarded as
one of the best sports pitches
in the South of England.
On the other side of the coin,
however, the money that will
be generated from the sale of
this site is proposed to go into
the construction of an exten-
sion to the current sports hall
in Prince's Gardens improving
the quality of the indoor sports
facilities of IC. will

Rector's Speech II
The rector has announced that
he will be giving another
speech to the students of
Imperial College some time in
the next few weeks.
The plan is to highlight his
vision for the future of this uni-
versity, and he will therefore
be discussing matters that are
important to the students, as
well as talking about the busi-
ness of running College from a
more bureaucratic point of
view.
The topic that is likely to be
of most interest to students is
that of the need for student
support and services. These
are obviously fundamental to
any university, since they deal
specifically with the students
themselves, and it is recog-
nised that it is important that
these needs are met from the
point of view of welfare, and
this will also benefit College
by making Imperial more
attractive to future students.
Other topics may be more
specific to the way that our
Union itself is run, as the rec-
tor is expected to explain the
new faculty system in more
detail. He will therefore proba-
bly be asked to comment on
the impact this has on the
Constituent College Unions,
although the final decisions on
this subject w i l l be the
Union's.
Finally the topics of
Intellectual Property Rights
and the capital plan will be
raised, giving students further
information on the college's
plans for the future. will
