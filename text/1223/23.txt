Hello! It is I, Wailer Ned, back for a special crossword, which could be
the only good thing about term starting on a Wednesday. Turnip Henry
and I have crafted this grid from only the finest materials - the black is
organically harvested from sustainable deep-space, and the white is
practically scraped off the Angels' laundry.
Unfortunately, Dr Hot Pudge is still deliquescing over some confection
or other and Bobby Cyclops probably got lost on his way back to college
due to parallax problems. Hopefully, we'll have retrieved our errant cof-
fee break composers by the time you join us next week. Despite their
absence, we fully intend that completion of this crossword will qualify
you for entry into the grand prize draw at the end of the year. If not, it'll
probably qualify you for entry into Dr Hot Fudge -1 hear he's not choosy.
Neither Turnip nor I have the faintest idea what the answers were for
the previous crossword inflicted on the populace. M y advice is to guess,
with the general rule that an X rarely follows a C, and that we would
never consider using a word unacceptable to the Pope. Apart from 'slip-
pery', which is clearly a totally disgusting word. G'Night.
