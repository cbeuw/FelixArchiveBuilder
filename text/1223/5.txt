Save A Nation campaign raises El 3K
£13,600. A small or a large amount of
money? To you and I an immense amount,
but what is it to Afghanistan's eight mil-
lion people in desperate need of aid? A
welcome gesture of compassion from
Imperial College students.
In an attempt to raise money for the
Afghan people, and to bring about a
greater awareness of the many hardships
they are facing, Imperial College's Islamic
Society decided to run an appeal during
the last few weeks of the winter term.
Entitled, 'Save a Nation' and with the slo-
gan A c t Now1
, it aimed to raise £10 000 to
donate to Islamic Relief, a UK registered
chanty that has been working in
Afghanistan since 1992.
The campaign was planned to coincide
with the Islamic holy „
month of Ramadan,
which sees Muslims
across the globe fast-
ing for thirty days.
With empty stomachs,
it is always easier to
empathise with those
less fortunate and con-
sequently it is a time
when Muslims are
encouraged to give
generously to people
in need. Furthermore,
Ramadan provided the
perfect opportunity to
introduce friends
around campus to
Muslim traditions such as fasting, break-
ing fast and praying together, allowing
the other cultures at Imperial to become
part of the appeal.
Fittingly, the opening event of the cam-
paign was an Inter-Soc Iftaar dinner (a
meal to break fast). Dinner was provided
by the Islamic society, but the real treat
for the night were the snacks supplied by
IC's national societies: PakSoc came bear-
ing samosas, MalaySoc, spring rolls and
ArabSoc traditional Arabian pastries.
Food was followed by a short presenta-
tion from Islamic Relief about their work
in Afghanistan, at the end of which it was
explained to the 200 strapped-for-cash IC
students present how a little money goes
a long way. Confronted with facts such as
that five pounds provides a child with
flour for a month, even the poorest con-
tributed. At the close of the event one of
the campaign, the total amount raised
stood at £2000.
During the following weeks, further col-
lections were made after the Islamic
Society's daily iftaar (held throughout
Ramadan in the JCR) and after the week-
ly Friday prayers, which alone raised
more than £5000 over the duration of the
campaign. Young, innocent first years
were dressed in luminous yellow jackets,
given big buckets and also sent collecting
around campus, but by far the most suc-
cessful collection (also being equally the
most embarrassing) was the collection
escapade on the 8th December. Equipped
with more yellow jackets and this time
sandwich boards for good measure, the
Islamic Society's more adventurous mem-
bers travelled to Green Street for a full
day's collection aimed at Saturday shop-
pers. They returned with £1500 to add to
a fast rising total.
No appeal is complete without a few
bazaars and jumble sale type events so in
true Blue Peter style two bazaars were
held in the JCR selling 'Save a Nation'
merchandise. This included a very stylish
black T-shirt fronted by the appeal logo
(still available if anyone is interested), cds
of 'Muslim vocal performance' and Eid
greeting cards. These proved successful
ways of raising money, as people were
more willing to give for something in
return, and the sales resulted in the cam-
paign being publicised widely across
campus.
A sponsored run in Hyde Park marked
the grand finale of the campaign. Around
thirty (insane or committed?) people gave
up their last Wednesday afternoon of
term to run around the Serpentine in the
cold December air. Some (less insane or
less committed?) people walked around.
Walking or running, a single lap around
the Serpentine added a further £2000 to
the appeal.
The total amount of money raised
through this campaign stands at £13,600,
surpassing the aim and everyone's expec-
tations. This money will go towards the
community projects being run by Islamic
Relief in Afghanistan and maintaining the
many refugee camps that have been
formed in the last few months. It will help
provide much needed food, water and
hygiene kits for the
Afghan people. Islamic
Relief has a refreshing
approach to humani-
tarian aid, taking into
consideration the
needs of the host pop-
ulation and trying to
provide respect, con-
sistency and fairness
in its relief work.
The Islamic Society
would like to thank
everyone who took
part in the various
events for their time
and effort, as well as
the other Imperial soci-
eties that helped out. The biggest thank
you, however, goes to all of the IC stu-
dents and staff who donated money to
the appeal, allowing us to show our fel-
low beings in Afghanistan that we care.
We hope that amidst all the money col-
lecting and fun people became more
aware of the problems being faced by
people in Afghanistan, and that our work
for them does not end with this cam-
paign.
For anyone wishing to give to Islamic
Reliefs Afghanistan Appeal you can con-
tact Islamic Relief on 08704 443 132 or
visit their website at www.islamic-
relief.com. There is still much work to be
done and money is desperately needed.
