Blair - Peacemaker?
British Prime Minister Tony
Blair this week visited a string
of countries in the Middle East
in an effort to boost peace ini-
tiatives in the region.
The Premier visited Kabul
and Bagram in Afghanistan,
as well as India and Pakistan.
He also expressed the
"gravest concern" at the Arab
Israeli situation, where
Palestinian Yasser Arafat is
struggling to maintain disci-
pline within the various
Palestinian resistance organi-
sations that fall under his
umbrella.
At the time of going to print,
36 Arab civilians have been
killed by the Israeli security
forces in reprisal for 5 Israeli
citizens dead over the past
week.
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
of Israel insisted, however,
that peace talks could not
resume until violence stopped
- while simultaneously insist-
ing that "police action" in the
disputed Gaza region would
continue as and when security
Israeli security forces deemed
it necessary.
Meanwhile, in a news con-
ference following talks with
Blair, Pakistani President
Musharraf announced that his
government "rejects all forms

Argentina
Argentina is walking a knife
edge between growth and
recession, Reuters reported
this week.
On Monday the South
American country finally made
the switch from dollars to
pesos, in an effort to boost
signs of a recovery in the coun-
try's economy - which has
been in decline since 1989.
The Argentinian peso has
been pegged one-on-one to
the US dollar since 1992 in an
effort to curb inflation., but
has now been released follow-
ing a recent upturn in fortunes.
However, inflation is still a
major worry, one British ana-
lyst insisted. A return to the
1980's (when inflation topped
10%) would cripple the coun-
try. Argentinia was once the
seventh richest country in the
world, but now falls behind
Brasil, Peru and French Guiana
in the region.

Former Serbian leader
Slobodan Milosovic stands
trial next week on charges of
genocide comitted in Bosnia in
1999. ,
The charges include respon-
sibility for the murder of 900
ethnic Albanians, and the
forced exodus of 800,000 civil-
ians from their homes.
The 60-year-old was extra-
dited from Serbia last year, in a
move that sparked controversy
and re-opened old wounds
within the balkan country. Two
more indictments will follow -
all carry 'unlimited' sentences.

of terrorism". In the statement
- the closest yet to a public call
for peace in the reigon - the
world leaders also insisted
that peace was possible on
the disputed Indian border
province of Kashmir.
The area (which is principal-
ly Muslim, like Pakistan) has
been hotly contested by both
countries since 1947 - when an
Act of Parliament granted
independence to Britain's for-
mer colonies in the Indian sub-
continent.
Then the two countries were
still essentially populus yet
primitive backwaters. But
now both have nuclear
weapons and large armies.
Both sides currently field
forces of around three-quar-
ters of a million men, arrayed
across an 80-kilometers
stretch of border.
Blair spent the week shut-
tling frantically between Delhi
and Karachi, where Britain is
still held in high regard.
While spectators have
accused Blair of pursuing a
place in the history books at
the expense of dealing with
domestic strife, he insisted
that British home policy is
best served by international
peace.
