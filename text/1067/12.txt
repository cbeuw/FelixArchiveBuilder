FEUX RUGBY
CORRESPONDENT
IC's winning run
came to a temporary
halt with a spirited
loss to the well drilled
medics of St.
George's Hospital.
5-0 down within
five minutes was not
an auspicious start,
but after a tightening
of the defence, IC
started making life
difficult for St
George's with some
storming rugby.
A succession of
quick penalties saw
Jack Peart go ram-
paging over the line
under the posts, to
open IC's account. The conversion defence more than once before the
was taken with aplomb by Gareth interval, to leave the score 22-7 at
Williams. half time.
Despite some stiff resistance, St. With work to do in the second half,
George's managed to breach the IC IC came out and gave it their best
shot. Ollie Lyttelton and Dan
Doherty were in storming form for
the forwards, and Chris Mutter was
as safe as houses at full-back.
However, there was simply not quite
enough fire-power
to turn the tide IC's
way.
IC's fitness told in
the dying minutes,
as a length of the
field move culminat-
ed in Trefor Beynan
sweeping over to
round off the days
scoring - though not
the day's entertain-
ment, as a hotly con-
tested boat race ,
vocal renditions and
an enticement of
cheep beer were just
a small warm-up for
the evenings activi-
ties.
The final result
was 29-12, but
defeat was no
shame, and the nucleus of a very tal-
ented side has started to emerge.
Tremendous prospects exist, for both
the short- and long-term future of the
club.
