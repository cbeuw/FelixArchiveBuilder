FELIX FRIDAY 1ST NOVEMBER NEWS 3
IC sports going underground
College designs for a new sports hall
are emerging with a planning appli-
cation due to be in the second half of
November. The original intention of
building underneath the recently pur-
chased Prince's Gate Gardens has
been abandoned in favour of a facili-
ty beneath Prince's Gardens.
Nick Black, College Estate's
Manager, has confirmed that the
number of trees in the Northside
Gardens means that the Prince's
Gardens option is 'technically easi-
er'. The College's million pound pur-
chase will not go to waste though as
it will be opened up to all members
of College for 'quiet contemplation
and study.' College authorities are
eager not to antagonise the local res-
idents around the Square since their
goodwill is needed for the planned
development of the Garden Hall area.

centre due to be built underground
the planning implications are less
substantial than other College pro-
jects. Mr Frank Murray, College's
Sport and Leisure Manager, is 'satis-
fied that we are coming up with a
design that will meet the requirement
of planners and local residents.'
The National Lottery application,
which is being prepared for the capi-
tal cost of this multi-million pound
project, requires the planning process
to be fully completed. The deadline
for National Lottery sports applica-
tions is 30 April 1997 but College
admits that there is no guarantee that
funding will be secured though they
are attempting to fill all the criteria.
With public funding dependent on
'community use', College points to
the high external usage of the current
Sports Centre as proof of its commit-
ment to openness. The fact that over
one third of visitors to existing facil-
ities are either local residents or come
from local schools will be of assis-
tance in highlighting the difference
between IC's application and those
by other institutions jumping on the
National Lottery bandwagon.
Mr Murray concedes that current
indoor sports facilities are not up to
scratch, "Whether you look at it now
or after the 1998 arrivals, College is
very badly off for indoor sports."
Since his arrival at College** he has
been impressed by the 'real determi-
nation' of senior members of the col-
lege to make 'decent provision.'
As well as the planning application
for the new sports facilities proceed-
ing with designs for new residences
to be located beside Linstead Hall.
