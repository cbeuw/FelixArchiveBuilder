Hong Kong '97: Stairway to
Heaven or Hell?
I V A N C H A N
Although I have been travelling in and
out of Hong Kong at least twice a year
for the past 11 years, I still enjoy the
final descent down into Hong Kong.
Landing in Hong Kong can be consid-
ered to be spectacular and dangerous;
you have to admire both the pilot as
well as how much modern technology
can do nowadays. If the aircraft is
coming in across the land it will fly
only a few metres from the tops of
buildings, and before touch down an
accurate right turn has to be made so
that several hills and a mountain in the
northern part of Kowloon are narrow-
ly avoided.
This spectacular landing will be
experienced by many people next
year, especially during the last 2
weeks of June before the 'change
over' of sovereignty on the 1st July.
AH the hotels in Hong Kong are fully
booked, according to some rumours
even Baroness Thatcher made her
booking a couple of years ago. While
Vancouver has the highest number of
air ticket bookings for the last two
weeks of June, with 54 aircraft fully
booked, Sydney and London come a
close second
and third respectively.
Most of these booking have been
made by Hong Kongese, who have
immigrated to another country. There
has been a rumour going around
recently that if a Hong Kong born cit-
izen would like to retain his or her
permanent status after 1997, he or she
must be in Hong Kong on 1st July '97
to witness the change over. Rumours
like these are very common in Hong
Kong; many people speculate and try
to predict what will happen, and quite
often some of these predictions
become rumours, which become part
of life in Hong Kong.
During the past fifteen years, many
negotiations between the British and
Chinese Governments have taken
place. The sino-British Joint declara-
tion in the early 80's and the Chinese
Basic Law in the mid-late 80's are the
major stepping stones of the future.
The Chinese Government has also
attempted to reassure the generaljyjj^
lie in I long Kong. 'Fifty jQjgars of
unchange', 'horses* caft contirifie to
race, people could continue to dance'
are just two of many quota-
tions. Other political agendas and
events are well underway and ready
for the change over period. Just sim-
ply looking at the one dollar coins in
Hong Kong, the old coins with Her
Majesty's head are become more dif-
ficult to find, and are being slowly
replaced with new coins bearing the
flower of Hong Kong. Another exam-
ple is The 'Royal' Hong Kong Jockey
Club' which is no-longer 'Royal' -
just simply 'Hong Kong Jockey
Club'.
The number of people expressing
concern for their future is easily seen
by listening to the political talk shows
on the radio. At any one time there is
at least one radio station broadcasting
a political talk show. Chris Patten, the
governor of Hong Kong, has had his
fair share of problems; being called
'Fat Pat' by the public and 'the man
with thousand years of sin' by senior
Chinese officials doesn't really make
his job any easier. a

There is a mixed reaction toward!
to lead up to the change Qver. Take my
Hpngf Kongese friends from the
Me^anjcgl Engineering department,
for example; we fin- t ,
ished our exam in early June.
Mark landed' and immigrated to
Canada in late June, Esther immi-
grated to Singapore in early July .
Some of my friends (like me)
posess one or more nationalities,
such as Canadian, Portuguese and
British - (British, not British Hong
Kong). Of course, some of us
remain at IC to face 4th year in
Mech Eng, and some of us are
working in Hong Kong.
Many Hong Kongese have, like
me, immigrated to another country
during the 'exodus' period of 89-
92. The 1989 Tiannamen square
incident had a vast impact on
many Hong Kongese. In 1992,
when the 'exodus' hit the highest
point, 66,000 people were leav-
ing Hong Kong in a single
year. A very recent survey
also suggests that in an office
environment of 100 people, 1
person has planned and been
granted a visa for immigra-
tton., g

me as an example. YY, who is in
my year, has found a job with a
main contractor firm in Hong
Kong. Her company has great
investment and is running a large
project in China. On the other
hand another friend of mine , (her
initials being MM, strangely
enough), still has two years to go
in her degree. I asked her what
she will do after her degree, and
she told me that she is definitely
not going back to Hong Kong
after her graduation. I suppose the
general public in Hong Kong are
quite unsure about where their
confidence lies. The corruption
within the Chinese government
and the law and order of main-
land do make people in Hong
Kong doubt about their
future. At this moment in
time the confidence of the
majority of Hong Kongese
is placed in the stability of
the stock market and real
estate. Many of us think
I* that Hong Kong is still sta-
tic 200 days before«ftie
^ change over, and that it
j •shotrld* remain so after-

weirds. It may sound naive,

to think.
In a way the approach of the
change-over brings joy and uncertain-
ty for most Hong Kongese, after all,
'Hong Kongese' is really Chinese, but
a British passport (which
requires a visa for entry into ^UKjp
study). We will no longer have a
ouncn of non-Chinese speaking peo-
pTefrfoking oyer our shoulder, butonjj
the other hand we will miss
the democratic and well established
justice system which the British
Government provides. You could say
that the future of Hong Kong is like
landing an aeroplane at the present
Hong Kong airport. In a
sense it's quite amazing to
