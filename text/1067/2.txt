We are the only international management consulting firm

clones".
As part of a multidisciplinary team, you will work on a
variety of assignments both in the U.K. and overseas, helping
to shape the future of some of the world's most successful
companies.
If you're looking for an opportunity to join a dynamic,
innovative organisation, where your individuality will be
recognised and your progress based on merit, we may be
just what you want. We only recruit exceptional graduates;
we offer an attractive package, comprehensive training,
and - for top performers - financial support for an M.B.A.
programme at a major European business school.
