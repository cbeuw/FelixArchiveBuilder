Hockey Seconds find only
moments of brilliance
IC started the match as normal, play-
ing very badly, and holding out for
fifteen minutes, defending like rabid
dogs. Bill made the clumsiest tackle
of his life to earn a green card.
Moments later, UCL stroked the ball
into the net to make the score 1-0.
IC improved, creating chances,
but were unable to find touch - a
repeat of last week's performance
against Holloway. As the half drew
to a close, IC were finally on top.
The second-half started with more
UCL pressure. Again UCL scored
on the fifteen minute mark, this time
from a well taken short-corner.
The game now began to see-saw,
with attacks from both sides. In the
dying seconds, Shaggy grabbed yet
another goal - and some pride for the
IC seconds - after a sustained period
of pressure.
IC Footballers discover that attitude
alone is not enough
M E N S THIRD XI
The match commenced st the middle
of the first-half, after, sportingly as
ever, we volunteered a 3-0 head start
to the UC boyz.
Jesus instigated a resurrection of
IC spirits when he slammed home an
edge of the seat thriller, which on it's
path towards it's eventual goal hit
both (yes, both) posts!
Despite the UC boyz lip, bad atti-
tude and disagreeable refereeing it
was universally accepted that the IC
posse kicked ass in the second-half.
Top defending by international ath-
lete Steve Cram, and the newly dis-
covered skills of Jesus proved entire-
ly irrelevant to thefinalresult.
Barmy Army march on!
W O M E N S XI
IC started off well against Barts, and
were unlucky to concede a goal in
the first twenty minutes. However, in
the second-half IC played stunningly
with the play mostly in the attacking
half.
The final score - a 2-0 defeat, after
Barts scored in the last minute -
clearly doesn't reflect our teamwork
and positive attitude.
Rugby Seconds flattened by
overpowering police
IC seconds sacrificed their easy
Royal Holloway game to give the
thirds a run around. Instead we took
on Imber Court, the top police side
in London. In the face of a heavy
battering from fat and nimble police-
men, the IC team stood stony and
resolute, with superb defence from
everyone. Pressure was intense, and
we were exceedingly unlucky to
come away with only one try, from
Kalone Yeung, which was converted
by full-back Jushin Lee.
The Man-of-the-match was David
Pearce.
Thirds let down by inexperience
BY W. CARLING

CORRESPONDENT
The match started well, with IC
camping in the oppositions half for
the opening stages of the match.
Their well polished set moves were
foiled by our play in the loose.
Holloway took advantage of the mis-
takes made, inevitable with
untrained players on our team, and
after sweating blood and tears, the
thirds went down valiantly. All cred-
it to the backs for their ferocious
tackling, and to the forwards for cop-
ing so well against a larger, more
experienced force.
