FELIX FRIDAY 1ST NOVEMBER LETTERS 11
incurred a severe knee injury earlier
in the year during a game whilst rep-
resenting Imperial College.
Although the ICLRFC is affiliated
to the WRFU, I received no compen-
sation or help from that side as the
cover offered by them was too mini-
mal. Also, the College cover would
not have included travel costs to hos-
pital and the subsequent physiothera-
py departments, or the associated
cost of being temporarily disabled.
The travel costs alone amounted to
£200, a substantial sum when com-
pared to the £1.50 for the insurance
cover that the Union now offers.
Fortunately, I am covered by my
parent's insurance, and this then cov-
ered my travel expenses, operation
and hospital stay. Had my financial
situation been any different, the
implications to myself could have
been disastrous.
By issuing Activities Cards, stu-
dents are made aware that the Union
is committed to its Duty of Care and
operates an advantageous insurance
policy. Speaking as ACC Chair, I
now know where to go if an accident
happens through any of the ACC
Sporting Clubs. I also know that the
cover is more comprehensive than
that offered by most governing bod-
ies and College.
My wish is that should clarifica-
tion about the policy, or the insur-
ance be needed, that students come to
the Union Office or see the Chair of
their Major Sub Committee and not
believe the drivel that was reported
last week.
Yours,
Caroline J Deetjen
ACC Chair.
Dear Alex,
A few points worth raising about
Activities Cards:
College has always had and still
has an insurance policy covering all
club activities in IC, this has worked
fine for x years and will workfinefor
another xxx years. So what do we
need the BUSA policy for? Nothing,
the two policies are virtually identi-
cal => waste of money.
The cost of each individual policy
is only 95p. So what about the other
55p? —> The official answer is 'card
laminating costs'. The Union is mak-
ing a profit out of it too!
Name withheld by request
I have received a lot of feedback
over this particular article, and I
apologise for any factual inaccura-
cies that were present. Un-
fortunately, I am not able verify
the research of each and every
article that is contributed, how
ever much I would like to.
The important point to come out
of this issue is that the new policy
and the associated cards are not
properly understood; there is con-
fusion amongst the clubs and their
members. I understand that Sarah
has released a note fully explaining
the matter, particularly the costs
of the scheme, and I hope that this
will clarify it for everyone.
Dunblane answer
Dear Felix,
I totally disagree with the views
expressed by the Rifle and Pistol
Club. No doubt the current law
should have stopped Hamilton own-
ing a gun. But it didn't - the law
failed. Human minds are complex
and laws that attempt to label them as
either 'A' or 'B' - 'safe' or 'unsafe'
with a gun - are bound to fail some-
times. Dunblane proves this: it was
one police officer's opinion that
Hamilton was a B but another officer
thought he was an A. We can never
say that someone is 100% safe and
we certainly can't tell whether or not
someone will commit a crime in
future.
I agree that there is no point ban-
ning handguns if we forget about
those that are already illegally
owned. However, with a total clamp-
down on illegal weapons, Dunblane
would still have happened. I think
you need both: a ban on handguns
and a clampdown on illegal
weapons. In the article, the RPC
seems to think more should be done
about illegal weapons. I agree, and if
the RPC can offer any practical sug-
gestions, I'm sure they'll be grateful-
ly received.

Sandwich crisis
Dear Felix,
I would like to bring to the atten-
tion of IC students the fact that the
sandwiches sold in QT are of both
poorer quality and higher price than
the sandwiches sold outside the col-
lege. I did some research last week,
mostly on Gloucester Road:-
Monday Egg mayonnaise with
cress 89p Boots (1.10 QT)
Tuesday Tuna and cucumber
1.00 The Sandwich Shop (1.10 QT)
Wednesday Prawn mayonnaise
1.19 Boots (1.50 QT)
Thursday Egg and bacon 1.40
The Sandwich Shop (1.50 QT)
Friday Avocado, chicken & bacon
1.39 Harts the Grocer, Old Brompton
Road (with free can of Irn Bru), (not
available in QT).
This shows that the sandwiches
sold in QT are on average 15% more
expensive than outside the college.
Surely the college should be subsi-
dising the students rather than mak-
ing a profit out of them.

Some valid points here I think.
Why are the sandwiches in QT so
expensive Mr Foster?
Careers clarification
Dear Editor,
Your correspondent Ben Weir (25
October) makes some important
points about the Careers Service.
First he says that the Careers
Office is not large enough. During
the first weeks of the Autumn Term
the office is particularly crowded,
however at other times of the year we
usually have adequate space for the
needs of our customers. We try to
meet the varying demands during the
day by having a Duty Careers
Adviser available from 1.00 to 2.00
pm to assist with queries.
The timing of the lunch time
Careers Talks on Tuesdays and
Thursdays is certainly a problem if
students have other events to attend.
Suggestions for alternative times
would be welcome, bearing in mind
that employers are holding presenta-
tions on most evenings during the
autumn term.
We have had considerable demand
for our Wednesday afternoon
Workshops this year. One solution to
this problem is for us to put on extra
workshops in Departments and we
would be delighted to receive more
invitations to do so.
We shall be asking for comments
about the Careers Service from users
by means of a questionnaire later this
academic year, but in the meantime I
would welcome any suggestions
about improving our service.
Yours sincerely,
John Simpson
Director, Careers Service.
Clayponds security
Dear Editor
I would like to correct some of the
impressions given in the reporting on
security at Clayponds:
Firstly, the College is concerned to
find a sensible and practicable solu-
tion to the security problems. Yes,
burglaries were running at about 1
every 10 days, but since the introduc-
tion of dog patrols there have been
none.
Secondly, at the recent meeting,
the College did not rule out any sug-
gestions. Indeed at the meeting there
was inevitably a wide range of views
on what might be most appropriate.
Some students even liked the new
carpets!! We did not rule out any
measures, but there are obvious eco-
nomic, operational and fire aspects to
be considered. For example, grilles
on windows and dead-locks have
fire-safety implications.
Thirdly, we are listening to the
Clayponds community, and it was
agreed that this would be done via
normal channels through the Warden
and the Hall Committee. The new
Hall Committee has obviously only
just been set up and I will naturally
be meeting with the Warden after
theirfirstmeeting, at which I'm sure
these issues will be discussed.
Yours faithfully
/ Caldwell.
