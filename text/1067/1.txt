Medics' forum angered by College
KENT YIP
Last Friday, students from St Mary's
Hospital Medical School and
Charing Cross and Westminster
Medical School, the two founding
members of the new Imperial
College School of Medicine, came
together for a briefing on their future.
The purpose of this 'Away Day',
organised by the student unions of
both medical schools, had been to
introduce students to the new med-
ical curriculum and to obtain feed-
back from them. The Medics voiced
their concerns about the transition to
the new course. Whilst it has been
decided that the present BSc and 2nd
MB students will continue with the
old clinical course next year, the cur-
rent freshers, on completing their 2nd
MB in 1998, will be transferred to the
new course; prior to their clinical
trainig, they will have to undertake a
short course designed to overcome
their lack of knowledge in certain
clinical matters.
One of the main feature of the new
syllabus is its emphasis on early clin-
ical experience. Some students were
sceptical about the attractiveness of
the new course to potential medical
applicant, who might regard them-
selves as guinea pigs. Dr Rory Shaw,
who was in charge of the new cur-
riculum, disagreed, voicing that
many would see this as a new oppor-
tunity, and he would be worried if
sixth formers were not prepared to
take it up.

dence of C X W M S was another issue
that caused concern among the stu-
dent body. Sami Ansari, president of
Mary's Student Union, questioned
whether final year clinical students
would still be guaranteed a place at
Wilson House. Ian Caldwell,
Director of Estate, assured him that
"any promise made in the prospectus
will be fully abided by"; he did, how-
ever, emphasised that at present only
students new to the College were
guaranteed a place in the halls of res-
idence.
Questions about the sporting activ-
ities of medical students after the
merger were also raised, particularly
the time involved in inter-campus
travelling (as dissection will take
place at Charing Cross Hospital)
would not only increase the expendi-
ture of future medics at ICSM, but
also leave little time for participation
in extra-curricular activities, espe-
cially in sports. Heated debate ensued
after it had been announced by Eric
Allsop, the president of IC Student
Union, that the medics would no
longer have their own team in BUSA
competitions. The possible sale of
Teddington, currently St Mary's
sports ground, caused uproar among
the medics from Mary's. The prob-
lem was further compacted by the
lack of solid funding for the new
sports hall promised by the College.
The lack of social space in the new
BMS building was, as expected,
heavily criticised. The suggestion by
some that the building was construct-
ed primarily for the purpose of hold-
ing international conferences was
forcefully refuted by Mr Caldwell.
Demands were made to recognise the
special needs of the medics, particu-
larly their close-knit social structure.
This has been a common concern
throughout the BMS negotiations.
Worries about whether the number of
bars currently on the South
Kensington campus could cope with
the massive influx of new customers
were evident. Mr Caldwell, in reply,
stated that "the College is keen to
promote intergration, and there is no
reason why there should be a sepa-
rate medical body." He also cited that
the bars in South Ken were currently
under-used.
The general feeling among the stu-
dents after the meeting was that of
uncertainty. The impression per-
ceived by some was that the College
had rushed things through too quick-
ly, and that they had not listen
enough to the students. Sarah
Edwards, former president of
SMHMS Union, commented that the
early departure of Professor Edwards
(Principal of ICSM) from the meet-
ing was symptomatic, and did not
inspire confidence in the College.

Inside
NEW SPORTS HALL
College designs for a new sports hall
are emerging with a planning appli-
cation due to be in the second half of
November. The original intention of
building underneath the recently pur-
chased Prince's Gate Gardens has
been abandoned in favour of a facili-
ty beneath Prince's Gardens.
