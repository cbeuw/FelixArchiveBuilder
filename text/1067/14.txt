IC Basketball makes a storming start
IN BOTH THE MEN'S....
Despite the lack of preparation time
for IC's basketball team, the first
match of the season against ULU
was a complete triumph. With IC
heading off at half-time 39-19, it
was just a question of how high the
score was going to get. The final
whistle found the difference at 37
points, with IC making their easiest
victory for four years - and this was
supposed to be the most difficult
match of the BUSA qualifying
round. With Charring Cross and
Westminster & Royal Free pulling
out of the competition, first place in
the group seems booked - especially
with Demetriou, San-Miguel and
Ioannides playing with the quality
they displayed against UCL.
....AND THE W O M E N S
IC ladies basketball continued their
fine start to the season, with their
second away victory in a row, this
time overcoming a strong team from
Goldsmith's. Indeed, the eventual
scoreline, 31-24, could easily have
been far higher.
Qualification in the final thirty-
two no longer seems like a distant
dream, on the showing of the high
standard that IC have been able to
achieve, such a short way into the
season. IC has put together a team
that knows how tofightto the end,
and includes some very skillful bas-
ketball players.
The reward? It remains to be dis-
covered....
IC Ladies FC true to their word
The IC ladies football team was out
in full force last Sunday, with a
smashing 8-0 victory over LSE.
Tension ran high between the two
teams after an initial pre-game run-in
at Waterloo, where LSE were bla-
tantly told by IC captain Stephanie
"You will loose". Proving that her
team never lies, "Schmichael"
inspired her team to victory from her
spot in goal, where she somehow
managed to find the time to score
one herself, in between dives and
blocks.
However, the Ladies' first victory
was a true team effort, with scores
from all sides of the field. New-
comer Hege started them off, fol-
lowed by a phenomenal corner kick
from the rookie Catherine that ended
with a smooth header into the goal
by the spirited Juliette, the mysteri-
ous hooded striker. Not to be out-
done, the invincible defence proved
their versatility with a score from the
half-way line by Tasmin after two
frustrating attempts. In the mid-field,
Eleanor and Tracey were a deadly
duo, controlling the game with
unstoppable fury.
RSM kick-off with 5 - 0 w i n
Newly promoted to division two of
the London University League, RSM
started the season with a bang and a
sparkling performance. Neil Price
was man of the match, thanks to his
relentless defence, which let not a
shot through.
RSM's international-studded mid-
field and attack capitalised on oppor-
tunities offered by the overwhelmed
King's College side. Magnus opened
the scoring, closely followed by two
more from Si.
In the second half, Magnus and
Karsten slotted away two more -
Karsten from the penalty spot - in
true Scandinavian style.
RSM look forward to another
great season.
Meanwhile, RSM seconds started the
season with a win, thanks to a hat-
trick from Edson, a goal from angel,
and the general ineptitude of Barts -
the game not being helped by a ref-
eree whose knowledge of the game
did not seem to stretch as far as the
offside rule.
Sport in Brief
WOMEN'S FOOTBALL
IC started slowly with a low scoring
first quarter, with Barts keeping up
the pressure. However, with a great
defence IC managed to maintain a
narrow lead.
The second half saw dramatic
changes. One of IC's leading defend-
ers was injured, leaving IC to play
the second half one player down.
But, with excellent attacking play
and hard work, IC put together a run
of goals, holding on for a well
deserved victory.
SKIING
The first match of the year for IC's
ski team involved five eager students
piling into a car and driving aimless-
ly around London, hoping to find
Brentwood Park. (Mobile phones
suddenly became very useful).
It was thefirstrace ever on plastic,
and some had never raced before.
Deprived of appropriate equipment,
the team (Amelie, Alex, Daniel,
Gilles and Rufina) heroically skied
into 15th place - out of 25.
A solid start to the season!
MEN'S FENCING
IC men's fencing squad won their
annual grudge match for the second
year running. The foil team is easily
the best in the country this year, and
started us off with an 8-1 victory. We
clinched the match with a 6-3 victo-
ry in the sabre, which gave us an
unassailable position going into the
epee, our weakest weapon, which we
duly lost 9-0. This gave an overall
scoreline of 14-13 to IC.
Eleven Yobs in Shorts? - The up's and downs of a week in the Fourths
OCTOBER 19TH
- SCHOOL OF P H A R M A C Y
IC Fourths excellent start to the sea-
son continued to demolish all opposi-
tion. Proving that their 5-0 thrashing
of King's in mid-week wasn't a flash
in the pan, IC again looked as if they
had been playing together for years,
although still only in thefirstweek of
the season.
From the kick-off, IC were in con-
trol of the game, with theirfluidpass-
ing repeatedly breaking down SOP's
defenses. The man of the match had
to be Darren "Brawler" Boland, who
scored all three goals, showing the
strikers arty of being in the right
place at therighttime. David dazzled
the awed seven fans with his ball
control, but was able to continue
after medical treatment.
The defence kept their second con-
secutive clean sheet, helped by cap-
tain Cook, whose prowess has finally
come to the fore, having in the past
been hidden so well.
Although only early doors (and we
know it's a marathon not a sprint),
the Fourths are over the moon with
their start, and hopefully if the team
sticks together, some silverwear can
be on show at the end of the season.
OCTOBER 26TH
- BIRBECK S E C O N D S
This day will be marked as a disaster
for IC football. Although only the
third and fourth teams were playing,
IC fourths were forced to break up
their unbeaten squad, to loan two
players to the Thirds. Result: IC
Thirds continue their loosing run,
beaten by a team who the fourths had
comfortably beaten in mid-week -
and the fourths loose for thefirsttime
this season, to a team two divisions
lower than them.
Both sides have now been
knocked out of the London
University Cup, a competition in
which the Fourths were among the
favourites. With a full team, we
would have won comfortably.
The IC football hierarchy should
not have ordered the break-up of the
team, especially on such an impor-
tant cup weekend. Individually the
Fourth team are not superstars, but
they play as a team - "one for all and
all for one" seeing them through
many tough games.
All the players want to continue to
play together. The future will either
see two week teams, or at least one
successful and social Fourth team.
