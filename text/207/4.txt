F O C U S on Wellsoc
The first meeting of the session was an outstanding success for
Wellsoc. This bodes well for the society, which is only now enter-
ing its"second year. Attendance at meetings last year was fairly
good, and it is to be expected that with such a wide choice of possible
subjects the H . G. Wells Society will continue to expand during this
year.
The key to this expansion is
the programme of speakers, and
in this respect the future of the
society seems assured for this
term at least. The programme
could hardly be more varied, with
talks on subjects ranging from
Forensic Science to venereal dis-
eases, from films on the American
Space Research Programme to
Professor Buchanan talking about
traffic. A n eminent doctor is to
discuss his attempts to reproduce
the conditions prevalent at the
time of the birth of life on Earth,
and Mr. R. M . Ogorkiewicz of
the Mech. Eng. Dept. of I.C. is to
speak on H . G. Wells and the in-
vention of the tank.
Whether the society will attract
the attendance it deserves is a
matter for some speculation. Last
year it received a certain amount
of bad publicity because it ap-
peared to revolve around Tizard
Hall. However it is perfectly pos-
sible for anybody to take an active
part in the running of Wellsoc.
In any case in a society of this
sort it matters very little who is
actually responsible for the organ-
isation of the meetings. If the
members want a particular
speaker or subject for a Wellsoc
meeting then it is up to them to
say so.
No doubt there are still many
people in the College who don't
attend Wellsoc meetings because
they don't really know what the
society is. If you are in doubt,
it would be worth your while
going to one meeting tofindout
for yourself.

Evil Eye
Magic or Science? This ques-
tion was raised at the first Wells
Soc. meeting of the year on Mon-
day, 12th October. Dr. F. J.
Nahapiet, a consultant hypnotist,
aroused considerable interest in
his short talk, during which he
described the growth of hypno-
tism as a medical science and
how, in past centuries it was con-
sidered evil and magic. A great
number of questions from the
large audience were asked, includ-
ing, one about the possibility of
enhanced learning under hypno-
sis! Dr. Nahapiet then demon-
strated the basic hypnotic pheno-
mena, including anaesthesia and
age regression, with his subject
with whom he has appeared on
television. The talk was followed
by further discussion over coffee.
Next Monday the speaker will
be. Dr. W. D. Furneaux, Director
Research & Statistics Group,
L.C.C. and will be speaking on
University Entrance Procedures.

Dear Sir,
I watched with great dismay the
attempts of all the societies to
destroy the newly decorated in-
terior of the Union on Freshers'
day. Isn't it about time that the
Union publicity officer tried to
exert a modicum of control over
the flood of advertising!
There should be regulations en-
forced preventing long term ad-
vertising, the Art club were the
worst offenders last yearl There
should also be an attempt to keep
the size of, posters small and stop
Guilds from plastering every
hoarding with hideous adverts for
union meetings and other beery
activities. Size is not the ultimate
aim of an advertiser, it is to pro-
duce an eye catching poster.
Can't the Union Executive do
something about this?
Yours faithfully,
D. Jones
Radios
Dear Sir,
I would like to bring attention
through your columns to those in
charge of the Union that it is time
that the radio in the lower Lounge
was replaced; its reception is
atrocious, many midget transistors
are far superior; tuning is an art
which takes months to achieve,
and if the continuous high pitched
whine continues much longer the
glasses in the bar may well suffer.
A good radio is essential to
listen to any music and very good
radios do not cost a lot these days.
Yours faithfully,
ANTl T.V.
Bar
Dear Sir,
Dissatisfaction has been re-
gistered in many quarters concern-
ing the abysmal service that is
given in one of the plusher I.C.
bars. It is felt that no longer
must it be regarded as a privilege
to be served here, let alone be
treated with some civility. Suffi-
cient people must be interested
enough to, if not bring about a
radical change, make the place a
little more amenable.
Yours faithfully,
NED TEEDHAM
Those who were wise enough to
join the beer and wine making
soc. on Freshers Day, and who
survived baptismal half pint will
have a busy term ahead of them.
If they can bear the thought of
commercial stuff after brewing
their own nectar, they will have
the chance to join no less than five
brewery visits this term alone.
They will be held at the rate of
one a week from next week on.
Unfortunately the tedium of look-
ing at brewing plant must be
undergone before the 'free hand-
outs begin, but begin they will,
and on one of them free lunch
will be provided.
Be ready (members that is) to
put your names on the lists which
will appear soon.

There is now a college Art
Club which meets regularly on
Wednesday and Thursday even-
ings at the Royal College of Art
(behind the Huxley building),
Everybody, whether absolute be-
ginner or expert, is encouraged to
attend and we hope they will have
an enjoyable and creative evening
making use of the free tuition and
model provided. If you have
never had the thrill of squeezing
oil paint out of a tube now is the
time to do it, for the very reason-
able cost of 2/6d per evening—or
by yearly subscription.
We hope to organize an exhi-
bition of members work towards
the end of the term. So please
would anybody with potential
exhibits get in contact with either
Miss Connie Fenn or myself (M.
C. Wooldridge, room 43 Garden)
as we should like as. many entries
as possible.
SMALL ADS.
The charge for Small Ads. in
Felix is 6d. per line. All adver-
tisements to be sent to the Adver-
tising Manager Felix via the
Union Rack by the Wednesday
prior to publication.
All I.C. men, and women too,
are welcomed at an informal de-
bate to be held at Bedford Col-
lege at 730 on 28th October,
when the motion will be "This
house believes that the cost of
belonging to N.U.S. is justified
by the benefits derived from
membership." Come and show
how I.C. feels about this; re-
freshments provided, etc.
