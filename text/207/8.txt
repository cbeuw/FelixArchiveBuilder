"General Studies" as is ob-
vious from the profusion of pam-
phlets and notices that flood the
college once a week, is an all out
attempt to fill many of the yawn-
ing gaps in our college education.
In the three lectures that are
given twice a week, something
will be found to interest nearly
everybody. The emphasis is
naturally on the arts and current
aHairs; the standard has always
been excellent, and literary lec-
tures and music recitals are par-
ticularly to be recommended.
As a follow up to the lectures,
there are particularly invigorating
weekend discussions groups
chaired by eminent speakers.
These are held in the sultry at-
mosphere of Silwood Park, with
its stimulating surroundings, and
sparkling inhabitants. People
seem to go to more than one of
these so-called " Touchstone"
weekends, so they must be worth-
while.
" Touchstone," as a further sop
to the arts, also organises theatre
visits which include a healthy
supper to which a leading theatre
critic is usually invited.
All you have to do is to go to
some of these lectures, and read
the extensive hand-outs, and, if
you are facing a particularly
dreary weekend in dismal Batter-
sea, you might find yourself down
at Silwood Park, with lots to talk
about, and astound your friends
during the following week.
Freshers'
Hike
Fourteen members of the crew,
including a record number of
Freshers assembled outside the
" George and Dragon " at Farn-
borough, Kent, on the fine sunny
morning. Chris. Waterman led
the way in the general direction
of South, heading for Cudham,
which was eventually reached
after one or two questionable
pieces of map reading and tra-
versing the usual quantity of
footpaths, private property (what
garden ?), and golf courses (4
Dunlop 2 Penfolds).
The party were suitably re-
freshed at the "Blacksmith's
Arms" and set off at, a much
greater pace to the top of the
downs and then through Cheven-
ing Park to Chevening. It was de-
cided to rest in a cemetery and
discuss the graver issues of our
forthcoming activities (giving the
elder members of the party a
chance to recover). We eventually
gained the Polhill Arms and des-
patched two members of the
party to Keogh galley by car to
construct a meal whilst the rest
of the party followed by bus.
By the standard procedure of
maps and string we estimated the
distance we covered to be 12
miles. We are still calculating
the mileage per pint.
TOUCHSTONE
Silwood—EC's " country house," discussion centre for the weekend
of 31 October—1 November.
H I - F I
At the end of last session the
Tape and Hi-Fi Club was formed.
A few meetings were held and a
lot of people showed interest in
the Club—a few even paying
subscriptions (5/-).
The Club generally aims to
satisfy the interests of those with
the " hi-fi bug," a well known and
rampant disease with an unpleas-
int tendency to consume large
sums of money. It was mainly for
the poverty stricken student with
an interest in this expensive hobby
that the Club was formed.
The Secretary has put in many
writing hours this summer trying
to arrange a programme for the
64-65 session with limited success.
We hope however to arrange a
number of activities this year and
a meeting will be held on Friday
23rd October at 5.15 p.m.—Room
342, Mech. Eng. Department, to
discuss this years programme.
Freshers and others not quite so
fresh should come along to this
meeting if they wish to join.
