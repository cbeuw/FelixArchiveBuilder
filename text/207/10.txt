5 YEARS FROM NOW?
At Turner 4 Newall we give a considerable
amount of thought to the question of a man's
future. And our graduate training scheme is
planned to be adaptable to his individual naeds
— to employ and extend his attainments fully.
You May Know Our Name But . . . just to
remind you - we are not only the dominant
asbestos group in Britain, we also hav? a I arg»
and growing stake in plastics, in insuljtion, in
mineral wool, and in glass fibre . . . all adding
up to a £100,000,000 business with some
40,000 employees. Big enough to give a man
scope. Yet, because each of our nine British
companies largely runs its own affairs, not so
big that the essential 'human touch is
endangered.
This balance is reflected in our executive
development training which, far from tying a
man down to any one fype of career —
production, sales, administration - allows him
time to discover his true potential.
This way, we invariably finu that the graduate
assumes managerial responsibility more con-
fidently - and certainly earlier - than is usual
in a modern industrial complex.

details, or write direct to :

HOCKEY
With a large influx of Freshers
this year, and a hard core of old
lags, the competition for places
in all teams will depend as much
upon reliability and enthusiasm,
as upon playing ability.
The first team's prospect in the
London University competitions
this year are brighter than most
years. Last year's strong defence
which helped the team to victory
in the U.L. six-a-sides and near
first place in the U.L. league, is
reinforced by a county school-
boy, one of two who are joining
the team this season.
Highlight of the year will be the
return visit of the Groeningen
University team at Easter. They
will be staying with us in London
for a few days, prior to joining
us at the Lowestoft Hockey Festi-
val over the Easter weekend.
BOAT CLUB
At the Freshers' reception the
Boat Club has recruited a smaller
number of new members than
usual. However, from first sight
it would appear that their quality,
both in experienced oarsmen and
novices, more than makes up for
their reduced numbers.
Many of the freshers oarsmen
are at present rowing in their
constituent college Morphy and
Lowry boats. Morphy training
has been approached with even
more attack than in past years,
and crews are at present training
five days a week for the race.
Guilds are resplendent with their
new blades. The Mines have the
strongest crews we have seen from
them for a long time while R.C.S.
are at present an unknown quan-
tity under the practised eye of Dr.
Cameron.
One serious disadvantage the
club has at the moment is a
shortage of coxes and anyone ex-
perienced or novice, provided
they weigh less than 10 St., will
be welcomed to try their hand.
Are you small, quick and in-
telligent, if so you could become a
cox in the Boat Club. All training
is in eights added to which coxes
have full use of the boat club
facilities including hot showers
and bar all at reduced subscrip-
tions. If you wish to cox contact
any member of the boat club, or
pin a note to the notice board.
