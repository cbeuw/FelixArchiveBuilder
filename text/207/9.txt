GENERAL INSURANCE
We are sympathetic to your in-
surance needs and make it our
business to get better terms for
students. Probably, the most im-
portant type of insurance to you
is Motor and you may have ex-
perienced difficulty in obtaining
favourable terms for this class of
insurance.
We have connections with
several well established Insurance
Companies where we will be able
to insure your Car or Motor
Cycle at a competitive premium.
Even if you are already insured,
allow us to obtain a compara-
tive quotation for you.
Other types of policies which
will be of interest to you are Per-
sonal Accident and All Risks in-
surance. A poUcy hac been es-
pecially prepared to provide cash
benefits for students who sus-
tained injury during sporting acti-
vities as well as everyday life.
Most hazardous sports are in-
cluded such as Boxing, Moun-
taineering, etc., and the premiums
required are extremely reason-
able.
LIFE ASSURANCE
The importance of Life Assur-
ance is not really evident to a
young man in good health. But in
only a few years one's views
can change greatly. Premiums
naturally increase as one gets
older and any ill-health could re-
Suit in a higher premium being
required or possibly no terms be-
ing offered.
The importance of Life Assur-
ance to a young man is :â€”
(a) Cheaper premiums whilst
in good health.
(b) The advantage of having a
policy which, when one
leaves College, has ac-
quired value and can be
used for purposes such as
house mortgage and in-
vestment.
(c) Protection for one's depen-
dants in the event of pre-
mature death.
Our Life Assurance recom-
mendations are prepared from
the prospectuses of over eighty
Life Offices and we should be
pleased to advise you on the best
policy to suit your particular .re-
quirements.
A reply paid card is enclosed
for your attention and we look
forward to having the oppor-
tunity of assisting you when you
return the card.
