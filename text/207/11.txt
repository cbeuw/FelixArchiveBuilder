F E L I X 11
GLIDING CLUB
IN BRUNSWICK
Four members of the gliding
club, after arousing considerable
interest en route and cries of " im-
nossible " from customs officials
seeing a 30ft. glider trailer for the
first time, arrived in Brunswick,
Germany with the Slingsby
" Dart," potentially one of the
world's finest 15 metre sailplanes.
This had kindly been lent to them
by the manufacturers for the
duration of a flight testing course
attended by student groups from
all over the Continent.
In the ensuing fortnight, the
members of the group were able
to fly 14 different types of gliders
varying from exotic one-off con-
structions by German students to
a tailless French glider. They
were initiated in the art of
appraising the gliders quantita-
tively as well as qualitatively, the
diversity of gliders available en-
suring that each member of the
group was able to make assess-
ments against a background of
experience rarely obtainable.
Needless to say the enjoyment
did not end with the excellent
gliding available, and such items
as the moonlight barbecue in
which steaks were grilled over the
burning remains of a glider that
did not stay the rigours of the
course, and the many evenings in
which they were able to chat and
sing with students from other
European countries over a jug of
ale and a " Bockwurst," immedi-
ately spring to mind. The many
friends and contacts made resulted
in such a number of invitations to
come and glide all over Europe
that the gliding club could be kept
busy with continental tours for
many years.
The gliding, the superb hospi-
tality shown and the experience
gained made the expedition truly
worthwhile.

RUGBY
FFAGINS
FFLOUNDER
With ffanatical enffusiasm I.C. Sports Team
" ffagins " got off to an early start in September.
The ffirst game resulted in a win forffagins25-3
against St. Marys. The next three games were not
so successful, two being lost and one drawn. These
misffortunes were possibly due to the presence of
some guest players from the ffirst team. However,
under new captain Tony Ffilips, training has been
in progress and some of the team are ffairly ffit.
On trials day ffagins (without Peed Cunningham)
slaughtered Silwood Park 68-0 and look fforward
to a ffantastic season.
FIRST BEAT
POLICE
Score : I.C. 16â€”Police 0
Both teams played attractive
Rugby but I.C. impressed as
being a side with much potential.
For the first match of the season
the forwards and three-quarters
combined well, and this win over a
side which has beaten London
Irish second 15 must be regarded
as an encouraging pointer to our
Guttridge Cup quest. The win was
achieved with only 12 tit men.
Ray Harris and Jenkens both be-
ing off the field at some time or
other. Collins obtained much of
the possession from the tight and
the back row seemed to be per-
manently where the ball was.
Tries came from Chappell, Place
and Turner, Molem goalling two
of them and kicking a penalty.
SOCCER
The Soccer Club expect a successful season as
most of last season's 1st X I have returned, and
there are also some very useful Freshers. The
Freshers' Trials were well attended, and there are
already three Freshers in the 1st XI. The season
began with a good draw (2-2) against Borough
Rd. who are always one of our best opponents.
The club looks forward to a successful season.
CROSS-COUNTRY
The club got off to a promising start to the
season, with almost all runners in the first half of
the field in the first U.L. trials. A vigorous training
programme is in progress, and performances
should improve further during the season. The
second trials take place on Saturday 24th October,
and anyone interested should contact Tony Bishop,
Room 311 Falmouth Hall, or via Union Rack.
