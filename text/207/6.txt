Felix is the Newspaper of Imperial College Union. It is spon-
sored by the Union and read by Union members. It is not, how-
ever, a newspaper in the true sense of the word for in general it lacks
news. Some may say that this is a reflection on myself and the Felix
Staff. But I don't agree with this view. Almost all the Felix Staff
this year are undergraduates and all have important exams during
the year, so they haven't unlimited time at their disposal to ferret
out news from all corners of the College. They do, however, spend
as much time as possible, some even to the detriment of their
academic work.
Felix over the years has grown from strength to strength, in
content, presentation, sales and advertising. It should continue to
do so for this year and many years to come.
However, if a better balance js to be attained more news of any
kind is needed. It is up to you to help us to achieve this by you
making the news and passing the word on to Felix via the Union
Rack.

COMMENT
Editor Walker, made a good job of the first
Felix, especially considering the lack of copy
which some recruit-hungry clubs presented him
with, " Squash is also played "—but of course
sceptics may be forgiven for failing to see any
dramatic quality whatsoever in the page one
photograph.
* This year seems to have brought a particularly
beautiful band of long-haired scruffily dressed
teenagers to the College. I know that many people
maintain that Fresher intakes get mentally younger
every year, but whoever registered his date of
birth as 5th Oct. 1964 surely must have been
joking.
SCARVES
One or two observant peopie may have noticed
that the type of scarf thai 90 per cent of I.C.
students wear, cannot be purchased in the Book-
stall at all. Sad to say, no one appears to mind
about this enough to complain to Council, who run
the place. It must be the attraction of the bus ride
to Irvings in Leicester Square that does it! Per-
haps just a little notice in the Bookstall warning
freshers off purchasing scarves they may never
use, might be in order.
UNION BUILDING
While the old Union was being repainted in the
Summer, why didn't those almost illegible signs on
the doors receive the same treatment? In addition,
the introduction of some signposting of essential
facilities might help Saturday night hop-goers
among others. Anyway, the uncontrolled poster
billing orgy on freshers day ruined much of the
painters hard work. " First prize " again to Wells
Soc. for gumming stickers over the Union Clock—
its about time someone told them when to stick
their posters and where.
