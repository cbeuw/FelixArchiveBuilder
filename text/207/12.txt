SHORT
TAKES
David Reich, who last term
was elected Chairman of De-
bates, is continuing in this post
although he has unexpectedly had
to leave College for a year. He is
working in Kingston but is coming
to College two afternoons a week
to keep the Society running. Let
us hope that the Society will, this
year, rise off its knees.
The Union Blue Book, the
Freshers' Guide to Societies, has
still not materialised. It was first
promised at the beginning of Sep-
tember, but, due to a variety of
causes, the printers cannot give a
definite date for the delivery.
It is reported that Dr. Oyneron,
Warden of Tizard Hall and
Reader in the Mechanical Engin-
eering Dept. of C. & G. is coach-
ing the R.C.S. Morphy Crew.
(See Page 11).
Teething troubles: —six times
in one week a lift in the new
Mines extension has come to grief
between floors.

At the Tizard coming-up
dinner, alcohol failed to reach
any table other than that of the
Warden.
Saturday, 10th October saw the
start of a new round of South
Side parties lasting well into the
early hours of the next day. This
was in celebration of the t21st
birthday of Norman Price: the
President reported a total absence
of complaints regarding noise,
having attended a meeting that
very morning concerning this dan-
ger.

C & G TV—A PRIZE
Monday, 5th October—yet another Freshers'
Day; more spectacular perhaps than last year's
event, with exhibits in the Concert Hall, out in the
Quad and right through the top floor of the Union,
plus the Jazz Club in their room, heard more than
seen. And everywhere a litter of vague stickers.
C & G tv was impressive, if only as proof that
those concerned could maintain a good-quality
picture throughout the afternoon—a worthy con-
solation prize for their dismal failure at the Presi-
dent's Ball last term.

1,200 ELUSIVE FRESHERS
In spite of widespread satisfaction in the clubs
on their day's work, they will soon realise that
they will have to step up the pressure of their sales-
manship on new blood. For the 1200* freshmen
and freshwomen appear to have been generally
well briefed on the dangers of " all play and no
work " to the extent that many aim to totally avoid
any extra curricular activity.
More was on display than on any previous
Freshers' Day. But the Union may find it more
advantageous in future to spread its tour de force
over 2 or 3 days, and so wean freshers into a
balanced college life rather than in an hour or so
rush them with a " take it or leave i t " impression
of the Union, jolted hypnotically the next day into
" work, work and nothing but work.".
