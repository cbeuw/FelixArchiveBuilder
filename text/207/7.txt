Phoenix needs staff
Were you editor of your School
magazine or did you write way
out arty material that the editor
did not understand or can you
write good interesting material?
If so " Phoenix" the college
magazine is waiting to hear from
you, and we can assure you that
we are a lot more progressive
than your school magazine ever
was!
We need short stories, feature
articles, poetry, even an occa-
sional joke has been known to
appear in our learned pages. We
also require organizers, particu-
larly an advertising manager,
painters of posters, drawers or
artwork, takers of photographs,
and sellers of copies.
We should also be pleased to
hear from any of our past con-
tributors, as well as any other non-
freshers who may be interested in
writing for us.
Copy date for the next issue is
the 26th October, so please give
your copy to any of the following
people: —
Carol Thompson, Editor
Paul Rogers, Sub-Editor
If they are not to be found, send
it via the rack.
P. R. H A L L ,
Business Manager.
RCSerama
Another year is under way with
new undergraduates and new
Union officers. Each year we set
out to live up to, or better still,
improve upon the actions of our
predecessors.
Cynics may regard tradition as
simply an excuse for doing the
same old things ad nauseam.
When asked why they don't come
to RCS Union meetings some
people say it is because they are
just not interested. We can't
cater for such people unless they
speak up; after all, it is your
money we are using to maintain
this Union,
If you want to do something
new then, for heaven's sake, say
so—at a Union meeting for in-
stance. These are informal and
somewhat lighthearted, so you
needn't worry about looking a
fool. (Some people purposely act
the fool). If you want to propose
a motion, just let the Secretary
know beforehand.
Maybe you have an idea that
you don't want to expound in
public. If this is so, then why
don't you just drop in for a chat
with one of the Union officers.
The new executive have a diffi-
cult job to do, and any way that
you can lighten their burden will
be greatly appreciated.
Who to see and where to find
them—

Chris Evans (Vice-President)

Guildfinger
The column born of our age,
replacing the old Spannerama.
The column that gives you the
news and views of Guildsmen.
Freshers' Day
Freshers Guildsmen (and the
two Fresher Guildswomen) had a
good opportunity to see Guilds
Union in operation when C & G
T.V. produced two and a half
hours of programme on Freshers
Day. Our thanks to the Radio
Soc. and the Drama Soc. for their
help in this highly successful
venture.
Union Meeting
President Dave Bishop opened
the first Union Meeting at pre-
cisely 1.15 in Room 542 of the
Mech. Block on Tuesday, Oct.
13th. When asked if the minutes
should not be signed, there was a
unanimous "No" from the floor.
Hence the President was forced to
sign the minutes. The Hon. Sec.
then announced the Co-respond-
ence, and elections were held.
This was followed by a strange
gentleman, who claimed he was a
Peeping Tom in the French Army,
and proved it by giving details of
Morphy Day on Nov. 4th.
Despite screaming jets and a
train, Pete Moss elatedly informed
the meeting that Bo would again
" run " to Brighton for his annual
weekend.
There was a good response to
the plea, on behalf of the Lord
Mayor, for Guildsmen to carry
eight foot tools in the Lord
Mayor's show on 14th Nov.
An immaculately dressed
" Monsieu Grote" " then showed
his Autumn collection of fashions
for Freshers. Especially attractive
was the Sporty Morphy Day en-
semble, featuring the new shorter
booties with pre-stressed concrete
soles arc-welded to ceramic
uppers and obtainable in five
pretty colours. The Yak haired
underwear featured by R.C.S.
tickled most people's fancy,
(especially the model's).
The climax of the show was the
Guildsman's coming out evening
dress for the Engineers Dinner
Dance, produced in armour-plated
trinitro toluene, with spectacles
by Focal.
The meeting then closed, with
the President undressing and suc-
cessfully, if precariously, dismiss-
ing the Herculean task of Boom-
laking. The meeting was then
adjourned till Morphy Day, on
Nov. 4th.
Next Freshers' Dinners
The new Spanner
Men of
Mines
Gentlemen of Mines take heed!
Here is a breakdown of the Mines
Social Calendar for the Christmas
term.
Union Meeting Thursday,
15th October
By the time you receive this
Felix the first Union meeting will
be over. This is a significant
meeting because it involves im-
portant -elections including the
posts of Honorary Secretary and
Mines Rep on I.C. Council and
changes in constitution. A re-
port of this will appear in the Late
News.

will be held. The first is on
Friday 16th October and is for
Undergraduate Metallurgists, the

for Miners, Mineral Technolo-
gists, Mining Geologists, and Oil
Technologists. All Minesmen are
invited to attend the " activities "
in the bar after the dinners.
Brighton Run November 1st

in attendance on " Bo " and we
wish them both a successful jour-
ney.
Morphy Day November 4th
After last years appearance of
60 dynamic Minesmen, R.S.M. is

R.C.S. and the attendant Bules.
Minesmen are reminded that the
object of this outing is to cheer
the Mines boats to victory.

ing success when students from 4

the Mines Ball on December 18th,
which will climax the visit.
