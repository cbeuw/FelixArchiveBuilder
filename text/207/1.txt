Carnival
Calamity
Pressure of work has forced
John Evans to resign his post as
this year's Carnival Chairman.
This, together with the failure of
Dick Reeves, editor of the Car-
nival rag, to return this term to
College leaves the remnants of the
Carnival Committee sorely de-
pleted.
Both Evans ar.d Reeves had
been thoroughly trained for their
posts, for they acted as deputies
to these posts in last terms Carni-
val. Consequently none so able
remains in the College to replace
them.
Last year's Carnival organisers
lacked experience. This year,
too, it seems that some people
who are prepared to devote all of
their spare time to the cause are
desperately needed to learn the
ropes of their trades and pull off
an even more successful Carnival.
We wish them all the luck in the
world.

Concern has been aroused in the Entertainments Committee
at the number of people who got IN FREE to the Freshers' Hop on
10th October.
The Committee's chairman Phil Dean was dismayed by this fact
Both the Upper Refectory and the Gym, he said, were locked.
He was aware, however, of gatecrashing through the Billiards
Room and Upper Lounge; but this entry was soon sealed off. Entries
were also forced via the Upper Refectory.
Mr. Dean added that he considered the hop a great success. But
the experiment in swopping the sites for the beat group and the
dance band failed. The group will return to the Concert Hall and
the band to the Upper Refectory for the Saturday Hops.
Greater security against non-payees will be provided. The ticket
release is to be raised from 420 to 500. D.I.W.
