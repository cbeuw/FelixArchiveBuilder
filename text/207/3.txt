FRESHERS'
HOP
One of the Union's least illus-
trious. . sacred cows is the
Freshers' Hop. The purpose of
this assembly seems to be to con-
vince the Freshers what a wild,
swinging time they can have in
tbe great Metropolis. In fact, it
must surely drive them back to
the realms of Brown Baggerdom.
This year's was typical: On
arriving you found hordes of
people milling round the entrance,
looking for somewhere to go.
Because sign-posting was inade-
quate or non-existent, only pre-
knowledge or word-of-mouth
could enable you to deposit your
coat.
BEAT v. SWING
After fighting their way upstairs,
people were allowed to trickle into
THE CATTLE MARKET
the Hop. On turning right into
the Concert Hall you were con-
fronted by the sight of the Phil
Jennings band, whose members
outnumbered the audience. No
doubt "Tea for Two" and "Small
Hotel " went down a bomb at the
1934 Freshers' Hop, but tastes
change.
You saw some people drifting
upstairs and aimlessly followed
them, to find the real hop in the
upper refectory. The Saracens
were making up any deficiencies
in quality by sheer volume.
The Upper Refectory was jam-
med with seemingly hundreds of
people. The thought of the great
open spaces in the Concert Hall
made you wonder why the organ-
isers knew no better.

DISMAL FAIEURES
As expected, the boys outnum-
bered the girls, but happily the
Brown Baggers were out in force
—.supervising but not deigning to
take part in the dancing. So there
were a few girls in circulation.
Unfortunately, most looked as if
they had been brought by a relay
of horse-boxes from Bedford Col-
lege.
The Saracens were belting out
Rolling Stones numbers—some
were quite well done, but the
butchery they made of " King
Bee" had to be heard to be
credited. Significantly, Beatle
numbers—all last year's rage—
were now unheard.
If you wanted a drink upstairs,
you were disappointed—there was
no bar in the upper refectory.
You had to fight your way out
and downstairs to the bar in the
Crush Hall. This was in such de-
mand that the beer ran out early.
SO THIS IS LONDON !
The only way to get a break
from the overpowering heat and
crouching in the Upper Refectory
was to go to the Concert Hall,
where a very few people were
waltzing to the strains of Phil
Jennings. You felt sorry for this
band, but " gig " musicians must
be pretty insensitive.
All in all, the Hop cannot be
recorded as a great success and
only give Freshers a false view of
College life and London life gen-
erally.
What went wrong? The sign-
posting was poor. The boards
should have interchanged—this
could have been done at an inter-
val. Most people were upstairs,
but there was no bar there—and
the downstairs bar ran dry early.
VITAL CHANGES
Let's face it, organising a dance
is far from easy. And precious
PETER
CARTWRIGHT.
little thanks the organisers received
for their work, too. The greater
pity, therefore, that so much of
their efforts should be wasted.
Surely some lessons could have
been learnt from last year. Bands
of Phil Jennings style, however
good, are just not appreciated.
Their hire was surely almost a
complete waste of money. Are
two bands necessary? Would it
not be better to hire just one bet-
ter-known group. Manchester and
Liverpool Universities do it—why
can't we? This group could play
in the Concert Hall with sound
" piped " to the upper refectory.
Any unused costs could be met
by increased entrance and better
checking—too many came to this
year's Hop for nothing.
Although it is difficult to find
volunteers, surely it is worth the
effort in order to man a bar in the
upper refectory. It has been done
before—your reporter has served
at such a bar.
Judging by the hordes of hand-
painted posters be-spangling the
college, people would be found to
write a few simple direction signs.
WIDEN THE NET
Must the dance be such a cattle-
market? The girls look like the
dregs of Bedford College Life
(with one exception). There are
far nicer girls—not just the eternal
students either—at the hostels
around Cromwell Road. Yet
there were very few girls from
round there. Some more advertis-
ing there would introduce some
variety, at least.
We do not say the organisers
could have put more work into
the Hop—it should, instead, have
been better—devised. And be-
fore any cries of "armchair
critics," don't forget that many a
problem is best solved by people
with an impersonal outside view-
point.
