FilmSoc screen in the all new ICU Cinema, on the 2nd floor of the Union Building.
Doors Open approximately fifteen minutes before each performance.
Come a little early if it's your first film - 20p annual membership fee is payable.
Enjoy a drink with the film - drinks from Da Vinci's are welcomed in the Cinema. Popcorn is on sale
before most films from Da Vinci's Food Counter.
There will be a short interval of 5 minutes or less prior to the start of the main feature film.
When you see the word "CINEMASCOPE", this means that the feature film will be presented in our legendary
9.8m wide, "wall-to-wall" format (bigger than local cinemas!). All other films are presented in WideScreen format.
We always need help - especially publicity and door staff. Come up to the projection box before any film.
Times, Titles, and Prices correct at time of going to press. Check posters and Felix Diary Page for more details and latest info.
