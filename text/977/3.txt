Trauma
Student falls from third floor window. Excess alcohol
consumption blamed
Young Drinkers Are Warned To
Take It Easy'
BY SHAUN JOYNSON
Calls are being made for freshers at
Imperial to control their drinking
following a horrific accident in
which a young student was nearly
killed.
Older students made the plea
following an accident last Friday
night which involved a first year
male student.
The student had been drinking
throughout the evening and had to
be carried back to his lodgings.
Despite friends checking on him
regularly throughout the night, he
plunged from a third floor window
onto the street. He was rushed to
hospital and was found to have
broken both legs and all of his ribs.
Police who investigated the incident
are not treating it as suspicious, but
it is believed that alcohol was to
blame for the fall.
The accident has reminded many
students at Imperial College of the
dangers of 'the demon drink'.
"What happens is that among one's
friends, everyone's doing it, and
after a while, one loses conscious-
ness of how much one has drunk in
an evening," said Kerry Woods, a
Maths student.
Drunkenness among students is
no worse than in any other section
of the community, but students,
particularly those who may not
have been drinkers before coming
to College, have low resistance to
the effects of alcohol. "And the
trouble is," commented first year
Geologist James Gray, "you always
think that it won't happen to you."
"Drink is fun," he added. "But you
don't think of accidents."
Kerry Woods believes that peer
pressure and the free availability of
alcohol at many College events can
cause problems for some students.
"Most can hold their drink, some
simply can't," she said.
Cautionary advice to young
students also came from, John
M c C a l l , President of the Royal
School of Mines Union. He said
that peer pressure to drink to excess
should be avoided. " A t our own
Union dinner on Friday evening a
girl drank nothing but Diet Pepsi.
And she had a great time too.
Basically, my message is know
your limits."

The police had to be called to
Southside Gymnasium last
Saturday evening, to arrest a
student alleged to have smashed a
window there.
M r Grimbalston, a student at
Bristol University, was part of a
group from the Prince's Trust, a
charitable organisation, sleeping
overnight in the gym. The other
members of the group, who were
mostly from Blackburn, took no
part in any violent incident. The
group leader alerted College
security when the window was
broken and the police were brought
in soon after.
Grimbalston, who required
medical attention for various cuts to
his hands and arms, was arrested
and charged with criminal damage.
His trial took place on Monday.
Andy Wensley, Imperial
College Union President, described
Grimbalston as a "prat", and went
on to say, "I hope he sorts his life
out quite soon."
