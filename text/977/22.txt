Why The Senseless Killings?
Dear Beccy,
I was enraged when I learnt of the bombing
in Belfast. How can human beings do such
senseless, stupid things?! "Uh...the plan went
wrong - the bomb wasn't supposed to go off that
early - we even lost one of our own men." Now
I've only lived here for three years so far and I
admit that I have never bothered to find out
more about the Irish-British situation. However,
I am aware that this tension or, frankly this
problem has existed for years now. It is a
problem. Why has little been done concerning
the situation?
What has caused children to suffer and die -
what have they done to deserve this? Before a
smart-alec reader answers "c'est la vie" I must
agree with him - Y E S - that is life. It's too
precious to waste and so why aren't we doing
something to stop pointless deaths.
In the wake of peace across the world, Eire
and Britain should follow suit. Looking back on
the past few years, East-West Germany is re-
unified; there's the break-up of the USSR; Arabs
and Israelis are making peace...So why can't
we? It seems to me that the world watches the
problems of the non-western countries but
(conveniently?) ignores their own. It's time we
stepped back and took a good look at ourselves.

P.S. It would be nice i f someone with more
knowledge on the history of the problem could
write in. It's about time I learned what sparked
these series of events.
