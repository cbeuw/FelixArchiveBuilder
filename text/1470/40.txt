HANGMAN
What the hell is the
Shadow Cabinet?
We all have those mortifying moments
of realisation in life: finding out that
Santa isn’t real, that cats don’t have nine
lives or that holding a bin liner over
your head as a makeshift parachute will
not, in any way, soften your landing
when you jump off your house. How-
ever, even as young adults we’re still
encountering that same gut-wrenching,
soul-destroying, back-breaking-nearly-
paralysing feeling of sheer disappoint-
ment when we find out that the world is
actually painfully boring.
Nothing exemplifies one of these mo-
ments for me more than the day I found
out what the ‘shadow cabinet’ actually
is, or more importantly what it is not. If,
like me, you always assumed that ‘the
shadow cabinet’ was some sort of se-
cret governmental squad of ninjas, who
carry out backdoor operations, such as
assassination and torture, which seri-
ously breech Geneva Conventions and
humanitarian legislations, but provide
the government with plausible deniabil-
ity – then I’m afraid you’re going to be
sorely disappointed.
The House of Commons is split into
two sides: The side with real jobs and
the side with imaginary jobs, and the lat-
ter is more formally known as ‘the Shad-
ow Cabinet’. Because they only have
imaginary jobs, they can’t really do any-
thing except sit there and disagree with
everything. And there’s not even one
ninja! Is it too much to ask to have one
little ninja sitting behind David Cam-
eron and occasionally nunchucking him
in the back of the head? British politics
has taken a serious downfall since the
abolition of ninjas in parliament. This is
now the point where I rest my chin on
my fist and gaze contemplatively out the
window, imagining what MY ‘shadow
cabinet’ would be like.
Hangman’s Shadow Cabinet
“Mwuhahahahahahaha!” laughs Hang-
man in a somewhat clichéd fashion, as
he twiddles his moustache and sips tea
from his impractically small teacup. He
sits in his dark evil leather arm chair
facing away from the rest of his shadow
cabinet in preparation for a dramatic
turn (The evil leather arm-chair is on
wheels). He hopes to unsettle some of
the more timid shadow ministers in his
cabinet.
“So Hangman, your evilness, what are
we going to about the Prime minister?
He’s taken all the gold and he’s giving

David, isn’t it a bit risky saying
something like that on here?
You’re the Prime Minister ffs
it to the poor people’’ (THIS IS MY
IMAGINATION, AND WE’RE GO-
ING TO PLAY IT OUT MY WAY!)
queried the shadow chancellor, Herman
Defunkd.
Hangman sat and thought about this
question, whilst puffing on a vintage
Cuban (an evil vintage Cuban).
“Hangman?’’ asked Herman again, as
Hangman had not responded. This was
deliberate. Hangman wanted his dramat-
ic turn to be all the more dramatic, so
he just continued to puff on his vintage
Cuban (his evil vintage Cuban).
“Oh I know exactly what we’re going
to do’’ said Hangman, really slowly, and
then swooped round suddenly to face his
delegates. None of them flinched. Not
even the more timid ones.
“What the fuck!?’’ exclaims Hang-
man, “Why did none of you jump? I
turned around really quickly.’’
“It wasn’t really that scary’’ said
Greg Cranford, Shadow secretary of
Education.
“What, really? But – but it was so sud-
den. One moment I was facing that way,
then suddenly I’m facing this...”
“Yeah, we know what you were going
for, it just, well, you were a bit clanky
with the turn’’ said Herman Defunkd.
“Clanky?’’
“Yeah, sort of clanky.’’
“What do you mean clanky?’’
“You know, clanky – sort of like, not
smooth – clanky.’’
“Linda, was I clanky?’’
Linda shuffled her papers nervously
and kept her eyes fixated on the desk,
“You were a tiny bit clanky’’ she
mumbles.
“Right well, I guess we had better get
on to the more important issue at hand –
the poor people’’ Hangman regains his
evil composure and frowns deviously. It
sort of looks more angry/concerned than
evil, but in all fairness he’s still a bit
pissed off at being told that his dramatic
turn was clanky.
“The Prime minister is giving all
the gold to the poor people’’ continues
Herman, “We’ve got to do something!
Soon we’re going to run out of gold!’’
(I HAVE A VERY TENUOUS GRASP
OF HOW THE ECONOMY WORKS).
“We must do something decidedly
evil!’’ says Hangman, evilly.
“What do you have in mind?’’ asks
Linda.
“We should tell the Prime minister
that he shout NOT give gold to the poor
people! Mwuhahahahaha.’’
“...right. I can sort of see where you’re
coming from’’ says Herman, ‘’but per-
haps, you know, we should offer an even
more evil alternative?’’
“No Herman, you know what? You
should go fuck yourself!’’
“What? Hangman I was just trying
to...”
“You’re always just like, being a dick
to me and stuff’’ Hangman quickly turns
to look back out the window, not in a
vain attempt to look dramatic again, but
to conceal the fact that he is welling up
with tears.
“Hangman, I’m sorry, I’m not trying
to be a dick...”
“I’m Not Clanky! You’re clanky!’’
And Hangman runs out of the dining
room, sobbing and upset. Well, sort of
upset/concerned.
“Oh well done Linda!!’’ says Herman.
And who do I have to screw to get one?
