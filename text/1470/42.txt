The Felix University/College-Wide Invitational Tour-
nament League is new and improved, with prizes for
both the winning team and the winning individual.
REVISED POINTS SCHEME!
We have revised our points scheme to try and
make things clearer. Points from previous weeks
will be converted into the new system.
Points will be awarded per individual puzzles
solved. The first person/team to send in a correct
answer for a puzzle will receive 2 points per puzzle.
After that people who send in correct answers will
be awarded 1 point per puzzle. Double points are
awarded for cryptic crosswords, therefore 4 points
for the first correct answer and 2 points for oth-
ers. Individual and team leagues are separate. The
number of puzzles may change from week to week,
which may not be fair points wise but its only a bit
of fun.
Now then FUCWITs, answers to puzzles.felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk. Go!

You love it, your mates love it, even
your gran loves this mental, mind fuck
of a puzzle. I’ve even seen the lecturers
do them in their spare time. No jokes...
If you’ve ever played minesweeper,
then you should be able to understand
this puzzle. The number in each box
represents the number of lines that
can exist around it. Lines can never
cross! In the end, you will end up with
a closed loop. Just have a look at the
same in the next column.

Make as many words of at least
4 letters as you can, always using
the central one. NO plurals,
conjugated verbs, comparatives
or superlatives, because I said so..
There is always one 9 letter word.
