W
ith Champions
League football now
gracing three Lon-
don grounds on a
regular basis, foot-
ball fans of Imperial College could be
forgiven for overlooking the events un-
folding at Queen’s Park Rangers. How-
ever, Sport Imperial are offering a dis-
count to students on match tickets and
a Saturday afternoon at Loftus Road is
enjoyable, exciting and affordable.
Rangers currently sit proudly at the
summit of the Championship, one of
only unbeaten teams in England this sea-
son. Outspoken manager Neil Warnock,
whose Wikipedia contains a ‘Disputes’
section with over forty entries, has his
team playing an attractive and ambi-
tious style of football, and he recently
suggested that “[if] you don’t enjoy
coming to QPR at the moment, there’s
something wrong with you.” (Try tell-
ing that to rival clubs in the Champion-
ship, or indeed the QPR fan who had a
dart planted in his chest by a Milwall fan
during crowd trouble at a recent match).
Warnock has revived the career of
much-maligned former Irish interna-
tional goalkeeper Paddy Kenny, whom
he managed at Sheffield United. Kenny
served a nine-month ban last season af-
ter failing a drugs test but has deserved-
ly kept ex-Spurs player Radek Cerny out
of the team, conceding just three league
goals this season.
The majority of the credit for this fine
defensive record, however, has to go to
the QPR backline, many of whom carry
Premier League experience. Older play-
ers like Mikele Leigertwood and Fitz
Hall have been complimented with
fresher blood such as centre-back Mat-
thew Connolly and on-loan Tottenham
youngster Kyle Naughton.
Midfield anchor Shaun Derry has add-
ed the steely edge that Championship
football requires, and is partnered in
the middle by Hungarian Akos Buzsaky
(who boasts among his fans the manager
who brought him from Hungary to FC
Porto, one Mr. José Mourinho).
What truly sets QPR apart from their
rivals is their attacking threat. Young
winger Hogan Ephraim has delighted the
Loftus Road faithful with his mazy runs
and trickery and, despite having played
at youth level for England, is thought to
be considering overtures from Republic
of Ireland manager Giovanni Trapattoni.
Up front, Heidar Helguson and Jamie
Mackie have been keeping the likes of
Rob Hulse, Patrick Agyemang and Tom-
my Smith out of the team. Helguson in
particular has added a physical dimen-
sion to Rangers’ attack, while Mackie’s
work ethic and goal-scoring ability have
led to a call-up to the Scotland squad.
The undoubted star of the QPR team
is Moroccan midfielder and vice-captain
Adel Taarabt. Having impressed on loan
from parent club Tottenham Hotspur last
season, Taarabt was signed for an initial
fee of £600,000in the summer transfer
window. Described as a ‘genius’ with
‘frightening skill’ by Harry Redknapp,
the 21-year-old was nonetheless un-
able to break into the first team squad at
Spurs and his relationship with his man-
ager deteriorated as a result. He possess-
es speed, skills and vision in abundance,
and under Warnock he has become the
creative fulcrum of the QPR team.
Furthermore, QPR and Imperial have
established a relationship which, in ad-
dition to cheaper tickets, allows the club
to train at the college’s facilities at Har-
lington , and the men’s football team are
given regular access to the club’s coach-
ing staff.
So while a trip to QPR make lack the
glamour of a Premier League fixture, it
is nonetheless an opportunity to watch
pleasant football in a cheap, friendly and
comfortable environment.
