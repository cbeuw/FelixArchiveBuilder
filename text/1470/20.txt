COMMENT
Dawkins =Asshole (p < 0.05)
P
rofessor Richard Dawkins,
what isn’t wrong with that
guy? A restless mind, a head
full of ideas, and the man
really doesn’t like religion.
Sometimes, his work is a bit like the dia-
logue in “The Barbaric Beast of Boggy
Creek” – he seems to repeat one and the
same thing over and over again. The
man really, really doesn’t like religion.
Did I mention that he repeats that idea
over and over again??
We all know he is doing it only be-
cause of the money. That’s just the way
stuff goes. To be rich and famous, you
have to invent some image for yourself,
and make it sufficiently unrealistic to
be entertaining and believable. When
Christina Aguilera realized that copy-
ing Britney Spears isn’t the way to make
a million, she changed her image from
“Locker-Room Teen Chick” into the
“Dirty-Bad Girl”. Everyone perceived
this as Christina finally showing how
Alexander Khanin
she really is under the surface, because
when someone changes his/her image,
it inevitably means that the new image
is their “true self”. D’OH!! When will
people realize that a “true self” does not
exist, it is a myth invented by silly eso-
teric psychological advice books.
And yes, Richard Dawkins is just like
that. Like Christina Aguilera, Green
Day, Borat, the Village People, and ba-
sically everybody else. His image just
happens to be “The Atheist Dude”. He
has found his niche, and is making se-
rious money with it. I mean, the guy is
selling goddamn T-SHIRTS on his web-
page. So you have Chuck-Norris-divid-
ed-by-Zero T- Shirts, and now Dorkins
Atheist T-Shirts.
Those are a part of that whole “OUT”
campaign, where The Atheist Dude
fights for the rights of poor, oppressed
Atheists of the world. Maybe Dawkins
is a hopeless idealist with serious delu-
sions (no pun intended) about the world,
and/or he is simply a guy who has fig-
ured out which sort of image will bring
him the nicest salary. And now he is
bound to write silly books on that sub-
ject, be featured in all sorts of documen-
taries, magazines, sitcoms and all that.
“Hey kids! I’m Professor Dawkins! I re-
ally do not like religion! I really, really
do not like...”
Yeah ok, we understand. Dude. Just
relax. But yeah, if Dawkins actually
wrote a book WITHOUT mentioning
his goddamn view on that topic, then all
of his fanboys and girls would be disap-
pointed, and consider him a sellout...
Based on the scientific evidence, we
can say with a large probability that
Richard Dorkins is an asshole. I would
also like to objectively point out that
Chuck Norris T-Shirts are much better
than The Atheist Dude & Friends T-
Shirts. And yes, I’m an Atheist myself.
Stick THAT in your pipe. Would you
like fries with that?
“Hey kids! I’m
Professor Dawkins!
I really, really do not
like religion!”
Letters
Dear Sirs,
I’m writing to complain about the
caption “Mexican Prisoner defeated
by new security measures” in Felix
newspaper.
As a Mexican I can say that the pic-
ture lacks of any sense of humour, and
it reinforces the clichés that people
have about a difficult situation that is
happening there.
Considering that we are in one of
the best universities in the world I
am really disappointed about the bad
quality of Felix. Moreover, I’m sur-
prised that the Editor had approved
this caption which does not have any
content.
If you want to write an article about
the situation between the border of
Mexico and USA it is fine, but you
have to discuss it in a deep way and
not just showing stuff that does not
have any content. [sic]
Yours sincerely,
Juan Carlos Ortíz Nicolás
