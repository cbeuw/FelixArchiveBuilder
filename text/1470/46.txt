Rugby: 1st XV record first away vic-
tory of season over Chichester
David Wilson
R u g b y Union
Imperial 1s 20 - 16 Chichester 1s
It was an early start for the IC hurlers on Sat-
urday morning as we made our way to Cam-
bridge for the Hurlapalooza 2010 9-a-side tour-
nament hosted by Lakenheath HC – a crowd of
yanks so that explains the stupid name. Making
up the competition with ourselves and the hosts
were Cambridge Parnells, Oxford Brooks and
Zurich, the latter laden with plenty of ringers
from back home, so we had four 10 minute-a-
half games.
Cambridge 2-1 Imperial 0-3*
Our first match was against our hurling rivals
Cambridge. Straight from the throw-in, Captain
Finzo gained possession and fired over a point,
only for it to be waved wide. Cambridge then
took advantage of this and managed to knock a
cheap goal past Frankie “Donal Og Cusack” O
Neill. However, some resolute defending from
Neil Clancy, Chris Farrell and Paddy Com-
erford, and points from Ballyfinn man Evin
Coogan and Finian McCann left the half-time
score 1-0 to 0-2. Despite dominating most of
the possession in the second half too, Imperial’s
lack of accuracy was to be their downfall. Cam-
bridge finished off the game in style with a well-
taken goal, while Imperial could only manage
another point (and some dubious “wides”).
Imperial 1-11 Oxford 0-1
Jarred by the ignominy of our previous de-
feat, we were determined that there would
not be an Oxbridge double over us, hence the
enactment of Darwinian justice upon a shell-
shocked Oxford side. After only three minutes
of play Imperial were already three points up,
with a point kicked over by McCann and some
very well-taken chances by Ev Coogan, now
playing up front after advice over the phone
from Brian Cody. Ed O’Hare, now in midfield,
put the Oxford players under unrelenting pres-
sure, forcing a lot of mistakes as Sean Dunne
and John McGuckin rang rings around their
markers. Eventually the ball spilled to Coogan
ten yards from the net whereupon he made
no mistake in drilling it past the keeper. The
second half was much the same: while Oxford
eventually converted their solitary score of the
game, Coogan, McCann and centre-back Clan-
cy, displaying his versatility, recorded scores,
leaving Imperial the clear victors at the final
whistle.
Imperial 0-7 Lakenheath 0-0
Not much to be said about this game, other
than the level of hurling was as if a crowd of
blind retarded gorillas picked up sticks. Despite
the instruction at half-time to euthanize the op-
position, Imperial decided that energy was to
be saved for their final match and so we cruised
to victory rather than steam-roll.
Zurich 2-2 Imperial 0-1
Despite of the scoreline, this was by far the
mostly keenly contested match of the day.
Some Trojan defending by Neil Clancy et al
made sure that at half-time Imperial were a
point up against clearly the most talented team
in the competition, with a free converted by
Evin Coogan. The second half saw some tough
hurling, with hard shoulders delivered and
plenty of ash clashed. Unfortunately, in keep-
ing with the Trojan analogy, Zurich managed
to sneak over a brace of points and dispatch
two balls past Sean Dunne (who had pulled off
some super saves in the first half) as Imperial
began to show the strain.
So all in all two lost, two won, and a very
encouraging display from all players involved
(including Eddie Fitzpatrick who I now see I
haven’t mentioned in the reports). A fine stew
was put on in the Earl of Darby in Cambridge
and much ale imbibed, bringing a very enjoy-
able tournament to a close. The hurlers’ next
outings will be the Southern Region blitz on
November 7th and the British Unis Champi-
onship on November 20th. Let me (finian.mc-
cann07@imperial.ac.uk) know if you’re avail-
able.

Gaelic Sports: Imperial
hurlers at Hurlapalooza
Imperial overcame a bullish Chichester side
intent on winning their first home match of the
season.
The opening exchanges saw Chichester with
the lions share of possession using their heavy
pack to bully Imperial around the fringes and
were rewarded with a multitude of penalties but
showed very little attacking endeavour. Con-
versely, Imperial took the chances which they
were presented with; following a secured ball
off a line out within the opposition 22, the for-
wards drove Chichester back allowing Simon
Fenton to bundle over the try line adding to an
earlier penalty by Max Joachim. Despite this,
Imperial trailed their opponents 9-8 at the turn
around knowing that their play during the first
half left much to be desired.
Imperial picked up the tempo in the second
half with Ben Adubi finishing off a scintillating
team move with multiple offloads keeping the
ball alive; breaks by Tom Stone and Chris Mc-
Geough were followed by a deft back handed
pass from Ollie Cox which opened up the blind
side. Joachim and Toby Spittle combined well
before an inside ball allowed Adubi to charge
over. Chichester hit back using their ‘bosh’
game to good effect assuming a 16-13 lead.
Imperial refused to lie down and accept a defeat
against less skilled albeit bigger opposition and
so, Adubi grabbed his second try of the match
cutting a lovely line off David Bowe’s pass and
evading a host of Chichester defenders with
Nick Johnstone adding the extras.
Despite being reduced to 14 men on two oc-
casions Imperial held out for the win. Although
an away victory against difficult opposition was
a good result for Imperial, they know that their
performance on Wednesday was below what
they can produce and will need to Improve for
next weeks trip to Kent.
