The discDoctors’summer tour saw twelve Imperial
students travel to Italy for the BURLA Beach Cup.
Teams from across Europe met at Viareggio, near
Pisa, to compete across three divisions of high-
quality Ultimate in a tournament which saw Impe-
rial gain a top-four finish in their division.
While Ultimate is most commonly played on a
grass pitch, this tournament is unique in the Impe-
rial calendar in that it was played on the sand of the
Viareggio beach. Fortunately Imperial were given
time to acclimatise to these after their first oppo-
nents failed to reach the tournament, resulting in an
Imperial walkover.
The first competitive game came that afternoon,
against the Italian side Furie Romagnole. Building
on a morning of practice, the discDoctors played
well against a skilled side, grinding out long points
to earn a victory. One hour later and Imperial re-
turned to the pitch to play another Italian team,
Delafia.
The discDoctors took victory by a comfortable
margin and prepared for the final game of the day
against Mythago, the Bristol University team.
Knowing the Bristol team well, Imperial scored
several quick points to take the lead and, thanks to
an impressive defensive showing by the dD girls,
maintained it to win the game.
Having won the group, Imperial progressed into
the second group stage of three highly-ranked
teams. The Imperial team put in strong performanc-
es to dispatch another Italian team, Jacuzzi, com-
fortably, before a crucial match against Lemmings,
from Leamington Spa. Knowing that this team
were strong contenders in UK mixed tournaments,
Imperial were glad to take the early lead. The Lem-
mings rallied and scored several points without re-
ply, giving them a one-point lead as time ran out.
Fortunately Imperial kept composure to level the
scores, before winning the game by a single point.
The win put the discDoctors into the quarter
finals, against one of Germany’s best women’s
teams, the Woodchicas. Imperial faced this team
at the same point in the tournament last year but
a disappointing showing by the Woodchicas gave
Imperial an easy victory. Once again Imperial took
an early 3-1 lead but, after some good early flow,
began to capitulate and conceded six points without
reply. The discDoctors replied by playing hard and,
with a wilful disregard for their bodies, fought back
to draw level and once again took the game by a
single point.
The Saturday night party took its toll on all the
teams, but the discDoctors suffered not only from
hangovers but also an incapacitating injury to the
eventual most-valuable player. The Sunday morn-
ing match saw the weakened Imperial team face the
