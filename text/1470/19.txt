COMMENT
A
body like this doesn’t just
happen by accident, you
know. I’m gesturing at my
midriff here, you can’t see
from where you’re sitting,
obviously. No, I work hard to maintain
my physique, a bristling thirteen stone
of organic matter. Here’s my routine for
you – seven a.m., wake up. Eight a.m.,
wake up again. Sometimes I wake up
again at nine just for the sheer hell of it,
and also because I forget to set my alarm
on Sunday evenings.
Bam. Where are you? Still gaz-
ing longingly at the impression of my
sculpted physique on the bed? Too slow.
I’m in the shower. Bit of shampoo.
Bit of body wash. Then a little bit of
manly screaming as I realise I’ve used
the shower gel made with ‘over seven
thousand real mint leaves’ and my body
is collapsing in menthol-fresh agony.
Rinse. More body wash, this time with
soothing lavender.
Boom. What’s that? You’re still ren-
dered speechless by the sight of my un-
believably well-constructed neck mus-
cles? I’m sorry, but if you’re looking for
me I’ll be in the front room doing bench

presses while drinking my muesli-based
protein shake through a str-
Alright no, I don’t do that. The truth
is I’m a little bit overweight, and my
morning routine consists of stomping
around my flat clawing at the pre-emp-
tive ghosts of all the television show
hosts I intend on killing and trying to
make tea out of porridge oats. That’s me.
I know I could do a lot better than my
wibbly torso, and as a student I should
be using my Wednesday afternoons to
enrich my life by taking part in all man-
ner of sporting activity, but in reality, I
either have too much work or just can’t
be bothered. And when the best on offer
is the prospect of chasing a small ball
around a cuboid room with a bunch of
other “blokes” while sweating profuse-
ly, well, I suppose I’m just a traditional-
ist. Where the tradition is dying young
and leaving a bloated corpse.
Everyone knows that health is no
laughing matter, but at our age it’s not
the only priority either. Yes, we’re all
of an age where great damage could be
done to our bodies, and equally an age
where good habits could be set up for
life. But we’re also at an age where we
have the best opportunities to excel aca-
demically, or play copious amounts of
block-based videogames, or spend long
mornings thinking up witty comebacks
to a tutorial helper’s smarmy comments
about your coursework.
Frankly, it’s pretty weird looking up to
the first floor of the Ethos gym to see a
dozen over-hormoned medical students
bearing down on you at a relative veloc-
ity of zero, while they secretly listen to
Korn and the Backstreet Boys on their
iPods. That pedestal they’re on, look-
ing down on you as you trudge towards
Exhibition Road at chuckles o’clock
in the morning, stuffing your face with
whichever chocolate bar was whisper-
ing most alluringly at you in the shop,
isn’t healthy for anyone.
My advice? Sod the lot of it. The
evenings are getting darker and you’re
reaching that fleshy middle bit of the
term where all the coursework collects.
Can’t manage to make it to some en-
gagement or other this week? Write it
off. Go buy a Wispa bar.
You might die five years before every-
one else, but you’ll have saved yourself
sixty years of worry in the meantime.
A
s I dodge knife-wielding
pigeons and Under-
ground commuters, dis-
gruntled by the sheer
virtue of being awake,
on my way in to college from the outer
fringes of the capital (and civilisation),
I remember with fondness my first year
here, spent in the sheltered haven of
Prince’s Gardens.
It was the one time in my life that I
could afford, although only just, to revel
in an SW7 postcode and the prestige that
came with it. It was Hyde Park adjacent,
should I ever require the pastoral support
of the ducks. Never underestimate the
wisdom that comes with webbed feet.
And I could fall out of bed and into my
lecture theatre. But what I really loved
was that if I fell out of the wrong side of
the bed, I would land in a museum!
By all rights, Exhibition Road should
collapse in on itself under the weight of
its cultural gravitas. The Royal Albert
Hall, the Science Museum, The Victoria
and Albert Museum and that cathedral
of knowledge itself, the Natural His-
tory Museum. Just thinking about them
is enough to get me salivating. Yes, it
means that South Kensington station is
always crowded and it would be easier
to wade through treacle to get to col-
Rhys Davies
lege during half terms but we are in-
credibly lucky to be situated where we
are. The air is positively suffused with
knowledge. But as much as I love these
halls of science, history, and culture, my
heart truly belongs to Holborn and the
majesty of the British Museum. It is a
prince among museums in its own right,
but what I find even better is its remit.
It is a cornerstone of the archetypal
holiday abroad. You trawl the markets
for some kind of trinket to take home for
the relatives. The vast majority of said
trinkets will consist of tea-towels with a
map of the locale printed on them, snow
globes in the Costa del Sol and plaster of
Paris stereotypes of local life.
This formula has been around, in one
form of another, for hundreds of years.
For young toffs on their “Gap Yah” in
the eighteenth century, these holidays
lasted for months and involved a grand
tour of the whole of Europe. And the cu-
rios that they picked up were more than
name plates spelt out in seashells. The
Elgin Marbles, the Rosetta Stone and a
princely court of mummified pharoahs
to give just a few examples. I’d hate to
think of the postage costs.
The British Museum was specifically
built to showcase the wonders and arte-
facts that its patrons stumbled upon the
world over. In other words, it is a trophy
room for all the things we’ve stolen over
the years. And we’re proud of it! It is
one of London’s top attractions – a stiff-
upper-lip monument to theft.
What I really love is that it allows us
to see history with a double-vision, of
sorts. Obviously, these relics allow us a
glimpse into antiquity but also, because
they are here, in London, where they
have no right to be, they allow us to see
part of our own history. A slice of our
country’s past when we weren’t quite
the quiet middle-management drone we
try to be today. A time when we craved
new and exciting things and didn’t
worry too much about how we acquired
them. We didn’t just experiment with
drugs (though gin and opium seemed to
stick), we experimented with cultures
wholesale. And the trend-setter for all
this was the British Museum itself.
While very little in the museum is
native to this isle, it will always be the
British Museum, as only we could steal
so much stuff and get away with it. To-
day, in these august years, it is like a tat-
too, a reminder of our naughty past. And
like a tattoo, it will be with us for a long
time to come yet.
(Disclaimer: I do not condone stealing
of any kind, especially where national
treasures are involved. Unless you can
get away with it.)
In praise of cultural theft
“The British Museum
is one of London’s
top attractions –
a stiff-upper-lip
monument to theft.”
“I suppose I’m just a
traditionalist. Where
the tradition is dying
young and leaving a
bloated corpse.”
No Pain, No Gain
The NHS and universities are
consumers of the scarcest re-
source in the UK today. Gov-
ernment money. Looking at
these two consumers shows
how the government could be
doing things differently in the
Spending Review. Chancellor
George Osborne’s cuts are a
necessary step to eliminate
the staggering structural
deficit left by Gordon Brown,
Tony Blair and their blank
cheque book.
I feel that protecting the
NHS is a mistake. It was a
Tory election pledge that
there would be no real terms
cut in the NHS budget, a cue
for their poll ratings to in-
crease. However, Mr Osborne
should have made savings in
the NHS’s £122bn budget.
According to the NHS Insti-
tute for Innovation and Im-
provement, efficiency savings
of £5bn are possible if there
were to be a reduction in the
variation of clinical practice.
£5bn is 5 times more than
the savings the Chancellor
will make with the child ben-
efit cuts.
While protecting the NHS is
a vote winner, the potential
rise in tuition fees is certain-
ly not, and could be the coa-
lition breaker. So who would
fill the funding hole, if stu-
dent fees were to remain un-
changed? I think the private
sector should invest in univer-
sity funding. Take, for exam-
ple, the banking sector; they
nab the brightest graduates
and make them work ridicu-
lous hours in order to make
profits of billions. What if a
proportion of those billions
were invested back into uni-
versities? Graduates will con-
tinue to move into the private
sector and, to be frank, the
private sector needs them. It
seems reasonable to ask the
private sector to invest in the
Universities that provide the
graduates that they want.
I’ve only talked about the
NHS and Universities funding
but there is a lot more that
could be done to improve the
spending review. Whether or
not people agree with the
way the coalition is going
about its business, the cliché
‘no pain, no gain’ seems most
appropriate in these testing
times.
