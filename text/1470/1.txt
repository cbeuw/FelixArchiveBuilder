In the controversial Spending Review
presented to Parliament on Wednesday,
George Osborne revealed the details of
the UK’s deepest spending cuts for de-
cades,designedtoreduceourbudgetdefi-
cit by £83 billion pounds before 2014/15.
With Britain paying £120 million a
day in debt interest alone, and total debt
expected to hit £900 billion in the com-
ing years, it is clear that spending cuts
are necessary. In what was described as
an ‘irresponsible gamble’ by opposition
leader Ed Milliband, Osbourne unveiled
a four-year plan designed to “bring Brit-
ain back from the brink”; focusing on re-
form, fairness and economic growth.The
clear message of the review was the need
for economic sustainability, achieved by
eliminating waste and reducing spend-
ing on welfare by £7 billion a year.
Whilst sectors like education of the
young and healthcare were protected
in Wednesday’s review, it is clear that
universities (despite being deemed the
“jewels of the economic crown” by
the Chancellor) will face tough eco-
nomic times ahead. With the budget for
the Department of Business, Innova-
tion and Skills being slashed by 7.1%
on Wednesday, student and teaching
populations are sure to start feeling the
effects of the cuts. The department,
which is in charge of universities, had
already been told to make £800 mil-
lion worth of savings in May. In ad-
dition, the reformation of tuition fees
(building on the Browne review this
month) was confirmed. However, in a
surprising twist, it was announced that
the science ‘cash’ budget would be pro-
tected, frozen at £4.6 billion a year. The
Chancellor expressed the need to in-
crease Britain’s ‘scientific output’, and
