Scorpio
This week you lick your elbow. GOOD
FUCKING GOD... IT’S POSSIBLE!
This is amazing, you HAVE TO TELL
SOMEBODY. So you do. You tell the
first person you see. She breaks both
your elbows and tells you to stop being
such an arrogant twat.

Horoscopes
Aries
This week you find yourself in bed with
two of your best friends. You’ve been
bitching about how it’s inappropriate
to ‘cross the line’ with mates but sud-
denly there’s two pairs of titties in your
face and you don’t give a shit. SPLAFF
SPLAFF SPLAFF!!! regret...
Taurus
This week you decide to piss off the roof
of the library. Your golden juice lightly
sprinkles the heads of studious Imperial-
ites who, on receiving this glorious gift,
are filled with sexual desire and start a
raucous orgy. Security get whiff and de-
mand that they stop blocking access...
Gemini
This week you spend 36 hours staring
into nothingness. You’re trying to focus
on that weird spot on your eye. You
know, that one just over... over there,
almost got it, almost... come on... Just
when you’ve almost got a handle on it,
your roommate kicks you in the groin.
Cancer
This week you’re really struggling.
Struggling with your breakfast. It’s been
doing weights in the gym and has you in
the terrifying reverse-suplex-headlock-
backwards-in-your-mum’s-ass move.
You tap out and realise that you’ll never
beat the boss level: DINNER.
Leo
This week you punch yourself in the
face repeatedly. You’re trying to tap out
the kinks in your disgusting face. You
ask your girlfriend for help so now she’s
punching you as well. When you begin
to feel faint from the blood loss you call
the police and she goes to jail for abuse.
Virgo
This week you discover that you’ve
forgotten to write this very last
horoscope... mmm what to say? what
to say? hum hum... *taps fingers *pulls
hair out *pulls eyes out *pulls scrotum
apart and eats it... *Felix copy-editors
look disturbed... *offer to share scrotum.
Libra
This week your fucking email breaks
about an hour before the print the dead-
line. I mean, WHAT THE FUCK?!?!
How do email passwords just change by
themselves? Why would that ever hap-
pen? I am seriously considering becom-
ingAmish after this... If they’ll have me...
Sagittarius
This week, you will contemplate where to
go out and fuck yourself. Fucking your-
self is one of your top 7 activities, and
unsurprisingly, a favourite one of your
friends also. You and your loserish friends
end up fucking yourselves at home be-
cause you couldn’t get in anywhere else.
Capricorn
This week, you decide to tell your par-
ents; not hat you like both boys and
girls, or that you are failing your physics
degree. You tell them you are into water-
sports and for some reason, that is actu-
ally well-received. They welcome you
to the club by offering you some water.
Aquarius
This week, you wake up to your flatmate
banging your ex-girlfriend in the room
next door because you were too much of
a vagina to give her some sweet love on
a semi-regular basis, complaining most-
ly about 9am lectures. Your new life is
now filled with limp wanking.
Pisces
This week you decide to change your
birthday somehow, because of the bitter
realisation that Pisces is easily the shit-
tiest of all star signs. Fishes? Seriously,
fucking fishes? Your only redeeming
factor is the fact that you have a fish for
a dick? Wait, is that redeeming?

Aunty
McPickle is
here to solve
all of your
problems
Dear Aunty McPickle,
At Imperial, I was the subject of many
advances. Pretty damn certain I was
a modern age Vestal virgin (minus the
virgin). I looked down on the male spe-
cies and thought I was fucking fabulous.
Now working at L’Oreal, I’ve become
a main bullying target and was called a
short, fat, unevenly-shaped, boobed dis-
grace of a female. What happened?
Yours Sincerely,
A Freshly Graduated Fatty
Dear Fatty,
You might be tempted to join the Save
the Whale Greenpeace campaign. Fail-
ing that, hit the gym, lose weight and
just accept that in the real world, you’re
just a young Jo Brand and guys outside
here aren’t so pathetically desperate.
Because you’re not worth it,
Aunty McPickle
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I’m in a bit of a pickle. I popped some
pills after having too many floppy wil-
lies with Freshly Graduated Fatty. My
cock is still as hard as Chuck Norris and
the rest of my body seems to be running
out of its blood reserves. I almost can’t
breathe and have to walk around with
my fly permanently undone (though this
come in handy for multitasking in a lift).
Help?
Yours stiffly,
Rugger Bugger
Dear Rugger Bugger,
Your best bet is to fill a room with 10
naked fat guys, and stare at them for an
hour for each time you tried it on with
said Fatty. Then just be glad not to be
around her anymore..
Shocked,
Aunty McPickle
