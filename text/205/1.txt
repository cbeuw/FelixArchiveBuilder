A number of I.C. students
have been attacked without pro-
vocation at recent Union Hops
by certain undersirables. The
first instance was at the Carnival
Hop when five strangely clad,
dirty-fingernailed louts set upon
three students, inflicting a black-
eye and a bleeding nose before
they could be forcibly ejected.
Two weeks later ten similarly at-
tired "gentlemen" appeared in
the Union Bar where they caus-
ed undesirable disturbance and
annoyance by throwing beer
about and by other unruly an-
tics. They then proceeded up-
stairs to one of the dance floors.
As a precaution against a re-
peat performance of the previous
fortnight a formidable group of
I.C. musclemen was mustered in
the vicinity of the intruders. The
latter, perceiving greater oppos-
ition perhaps, than they had
bargained for, commenced to
wander from one part of the
building to another in an endea-
vour to shake off their body-
guard, but were unsuccessful.
Eventually, as they passed near
the North East of the Union,
they were forced into the street.
During the ensuing scuffle, how-
ever, they produced heavy span-
ners which they evidently would
not have been very slow to use
but fortunately the door was
closed on them before any in-
jury more serious than a black-
eye had been sustained.
Extensive safeguards are plan-
ned for future Hops to prevent
a reoccurence and police will be
on hand.

DISCIPLINARY PATROL*
IT IS L I K E L Y THAT SOME SORT OF PROCTORIAL
SYSTEM WILL BE SET UP TO OPERATE A R O U N D T H E
HALLS OF RESIDENCE SOMETIME IN T H E FUTURE.
This is in essence the content of a letter circulated by the senior
warden to the hall wardens for consideration by them, and at their
discretion, by the halls committees. The necessity for such a system
has arisen out of repeated complaints from the mews residents and
at least one threatened injunction on Southside.
EARLY STAGES
Although the whole idea is still in its very early stages, it is
thought it will not be long before the plan will, in some form, come
into operation. Most wardens favour the idea, but emphasise that
it should be run by the students. At least one warden feels that
were the duty officers system tightened up there would be no need
for any extra action. There is some talk of a "Disciplinary Patrol"
to be made up of two or three subwardens, but there are, however,
many objections to this, not least of all from the sub-wardens them-
selves.
NOISE PREVENTION
The system would operate by
having someone, be he duty offic-
er, disciplinary patrolman, or
protcor, in and around the pre-
cincts in order to stop noise and
quell disturbances after dark.
His powers are not yet defined,
but would involve nametaking,
possible fining,, suspension, rustic-
ation, or expulsion, at the dis-
cretion of a disciplinary commit-
tee. In most cases he would,
however, merely caution, and
only on predictable nights of
heavy disturbance would the
"proctors" be out in force.
POLYTHENE DUSTBINS
It has for a long time been felt
around the halls, that some form
of discipline other than expulsion
is required. With the increase in
residential numbers and the sev-
ere threats facing the Southside
halls as a result, it is clear some-
thing must be done. A proctorial
system operated by students
would seem to be the most
satisfactory, although other
solutions may exist. Mr. Watson
favours taking the problem to a
Union Meeting for further dis-
cussion. Mr. GraVette's view is
that it could all be solved by
equipping the mews with poly-
thene dustbins. It will not be as
s.mple as that, but some light
form of control now, couid very
well prevent tne imposition of
ssrioua restrict.ons at some later
date.

ARE THE CHRISTIANS OUT OF TOUCH ?
TED NEEDHAM ASKS AND ANSWERS THE QUESTION
These goad people seem to be the subjects of indifference and
ridicule : perhaps this is the fate of Christians everywhere today,
but in the agnostic framework of this college they appear to have
failed completely. They do not make any attempt, it seems, to take
advantage of any inteiligent spirit of enquiry that we, as scientists,
must have: furthermore, they have mishandled recent situations
which ,with a bit of thought, could have gone their way. Hysterical
letters have brought out the worst of their intolerence, and they
have probably lost all the respect that years of hard work had given
them.
This survey intends, by describing these societies, to uncover a
fragment of the many influences and ideas that make the College
Christians tick, and to possibly shed some light on their intentions,
and the obslac'es they face in the College. |" Page 51
