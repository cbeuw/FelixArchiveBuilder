(From p. 2. col. 4)
At the moment we have a
satisfactory equilibrium between
the Students' Unions and the
Halis of Residence. The Unions
are content to allow the situation
to evolve its own solution. How-
ever, two wardens are trying to
force a change. I feel tnat this
is very dangerous. These two
wardens want to model their
Halls on what they like to think
is the 'Oxbridge system'—to me
it seems more similar to the
Public School House System,
with the 'house-masters' in loco
parentis.
LIBERTY ATTACKED
Make no mistake about it, the
traditional liberty of the Imper-
ial College Halls is under attack.
Tne wardens have the advan-
tage because Student Committees
change every year. Remember
the 'Visitors out by 12.00', 'No
unaccompanied lady visitors',
etc. Unless the Hall Committees
stand firm these and other rules
will soon some into force.
I seem, Sir, to have strayed
from the primary point so may
I once more say that I am con-
vinced that the best place for
all. student activities is under the
auspicies of the Union, and I
feel that a strong Central Union
is essential for tne wellbeing of

FAME SOUGHT as
It was the last gathering of the gallant band, before they were
enunciated for the final session by twenty fresh shining faces, and
they all seemed to realise it. A last innings, a final chance to establ-
ish ones claim to immortality they feverishly racked their minds for
some good stirring material. Havard was sober, Schroter wore a
jacket, Edwards appeared conspiratorial, and Ellis more worried
than usual. It was as though they had awoken to their responsibilities
at the eleventh hour.
NO HEROES
But glory isn't to be acheived in the opening stages of any battle,
and they could relax at first while Watson-Massey reported on day
to day affairs. Paintings for South Side, lockers for Beit, chairs for
the top longes, repairs, barmen, duty officers. Not the stuff of which
heroes are made, and at any rate rather bad ground to fidget on, for
no-one outside the inner magic circle really understood the finances
of the Union, and they knew it by now. But Parkinson did offer one
small opening, £20 to repair damage to the quadrangle after Carn-
ival. Immediately afterwards no-one saw fit to comment on a letter
of credit for £2000 from the Finance department. Watson-Massey
rolled on unchecked—the top refectory is to be re-opened for quick
cheap self-service meals: the Union has 9,000 sq. ft. to play with on
Central Site (any ideas?); two students are wanted for a subsidised
visit to Germany—and eventually rolled to a halt.
over the ground, and approp-
riately enough it was the Mods
who came under fire next—the
420 or so who attend each Union
hop. These it was claimed were
getting out of hand since the
beat groups became so popular.
There had been several unpleas-
ant incidents, and we were at-
tracting far too many undesire-
able people. Also the Union was
overcrowded. Griffiths, the
Chairman of Entertainments,
was apparently the only Mod on
Council. We couldnt have our
cake and eat it, he said, po.nting
to the massive profit from hops.
No-one had suspected Havard of
moddish tendancies but he.p in-
deed came to the hard pressed
Griffiths from that quarter, as he
opened his mouth and put his
chelsea boot squarely in it. "The
girls at these functions are too
young" he announced in senior-
ial tones—after which who could
take the matter seriously?
Carnival next—Schroter woke
up. Why was it held in May just
before the exams? Why not
move some of the events to
November? This had something
to do with Morpliy Day—he
seemed to suggest that the oars-
men could collect money from
spectators on the tow-path as
they went by. But what was good
for Schroter was also good for
Ellis, and there were fifty weeks
left in the year. He suggested
February. The game became
popular, and voices piped up
for October, December and all
the others. It didn't seem to mat-
ter much when it was moved to,
as long as moved it was. Nor
did it seem to matter what the
organisers felt, in spite of Wat-
son's plaintive plea. Eventually
reason spoke up in the form of
Jim Marshall—the question
should be held over for much
wider soundings : And held over
it was.
RIGGED ELECTIONS
Edwards Iept in where even
Schroter would fear to tread,
with alegations that the Carnival
Queen contest had been rigged.
The only ICWArian who had
entered had won, and there had
been many suspicious last minute
alterations in the judging system.
However, it seemed that Council
had also been fixed by ICWA,
for almost at once there was a
motion on the floor "that Mr.
Edwards be heard no longer"
Carried. Exit Mr. Edwards.
STATUS SYMBOL
Back to Watson to report the
outcome of meeting of the Halls
of Residence held to draft new
regulations for the Halls., The
general result of this was a
significant transfer of respons-
ibility from the hall committee
to the warden, who could now
act "summarily and independent-
ly" whenever he wished. It wasnt
clear what role the Hall commit-
tee had any longer apart from
giving advice which might or
COUNCIL MEETS
might not be taken. The main
inspiration for these changes had
been Dr. Cameron, who had
also been behind the earlier at-
tempt to bring in the "Hp.m.
closing" and "no unaccompanied
women" rules. He had described
the Hall committees rights as
"a mere status symbol", and had
also argued for a section on
moral conduct and a statement
that the warden was "in loco
parentis". He hadnt succeeded in
this, but would undoubtedly re-
turn to the theme year after
year, and if he got his way Hail
would be transformed into some-
thing more like a convent. Ac-
cording to Watson, Cameron was
one of the most slippery people
he had ever come across. "Witli
his students he is all sweetness
and goodness and light, but be-
hind the closed doors of the
Halls of Residence Committee
one sees a different side alto-
gether". Council talked about
the Doctor at length, and the
main hope was that he now
seemed to have sufficient rope
with which to hang himself.
WHAT TO DO
Miss Burns ("keeper of the
forms" to the Halls) came under
very heavy fire. It was alleged
that she was extremely unhelp-
ful, abrupt, illmannered and
calculatingly rude to students"
Once this subject was breached
with a motion tabled by •
Christ Tye, a deluge of complaints
and protests were released from
other members. Watson was
clearly at a loss as to what to do.
Eventually Tye agreed to with-
draw his motion so that "inform-
al representations" could be
made. Can the leopard change
its spots?
TOO YOUNG
Like a gang of Rockers at
Brighton the stirrers moved
AND SO TO WLNE
This sort of thing couid have
gone on all night, and indeed
Watson looked a little bored at
times. But it had cleany been ex-
pected, for at a given signal Mas-
sey d.sappeared behind tae scenes
and was soon observed setting
out some glasses on a side table,
this worked like a charm. When
everyone was sufficiency distract-
ed Watson turned to what was
probably the most important
item of business for the evening,
and asked Council to set up a
committee to look into the
Unions capital commitments for
Beit, South Side and Central
Site. Of all the cheek, this was to
consist of Watson—Massey and
anyone else they should care to
co-opt. But duty to the Union
was one thing and duty to ones
palate another, and all was
agreed without murmur as even
thoughts of glory were firmly set
aside in a mass exercise in self-
denial.
