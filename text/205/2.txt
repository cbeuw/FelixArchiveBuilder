LETS GET
IT STRAIGHT!
TYE ON THE HALLS
I am getting rather tired of the
continual drum-banging of the
Cameronians from Tizard. Hall.
The theme of several recent art-
icles in Felix seems to be that the
era of Imperial College as a Re-
sidential College has arrived and
that the Students' Unions have
outlived their purpose. Further-
more, it is suggested that the so-
cial life of the College should be
tailor-made to suit the whims and
fancies of the residents.
May I suggest, Sir, that before
these fanatics become transported
by their hot air to their Castles
in Spain, we consider the facts of
the' situation.
First some figures on the num-
bers of residents are shown
below:
This article was originaly a
letter—however it is strong
enough to merit artcle status and
now—the facts.
The figures in the last column are
calculated on the basic of 20%
of residents being post-graduates.
At the moment between 15 and
30% of students in any Hall are
post-graduate students.
Secondly, residence is normally
for one year. Only 25% of the
compliment of any Hall can be
in their second year of residence.
Thirdly, demand for rooms far
exceeds supply. The demand for
places was determined by the
student surveys of-1959-60. It was

found that 76% of undergraduat-
es and 49% of post-graduates
wanted a room in Hall. There is
no reason why these figures should
have changed substantially in 4
years; if anything they will have
increased because the standard of
accommodation in Hall has in-
creased and rents for flats and
rooms in London continue to go
up by leaps and bounds.
UNFAIR
These figures show that Im-
perial College is not fast becom-
ing a residential college, so that
any attempt to make the social
life of the college revolve around
that of the residents will be un-
fair. Activities of clubs and soc-
ieties must be open to all stud-
ents, whether they are residents
or not. The Union must be run
on the basis that all students are
equal, whether they live1
in Hall
or not. In this connection we
must remember that the location
of the Halls on the campus is in-
cidental. Should we treat them
differently because they are here
in South Kensington and not in
Acton or Battersea? I think not.
UNION CENTRE
I believe, Sir, that the Students'
Union should be the centre of
College Social Life. Any attempt
to make the Halls tne social
centre of the College should be
avoided. May I quote .two ex-
amples from other colleges?
First, at Sheffield, the Union is
more or less controlled by the
residents to the disike of the non-
residents. Secondly, Bedford Col-
lege has about 300 women out
of 900 in four Halls. The Union
consists of one common room
which reverts to the occupants of
Reid Hall in the evening. When
the College closes at 5 o'clock,
the nonresidents have nowhere to
go. The refectories are not open
to them; even the library is clos'
ed.
The Union executive of two
years ago fought hard to bring
the'bottom lounges and bar in
Southside under Union control,
so that these facilities were open
to all members of the Union.
How wise they were! Just think
what the situation would be if
these areas were controlled by the
'door-locking' mentality of some
Hall committees above.
MINORITY INTERESTS
I am not complaining about
Halls organizing their own activ-
ities. They can cater for minor-
ity interests (e.g. the Tizard
Brass Rubbers), but I do not see
the need for societies which have
exactly the same purpose as im-
perial College Union societies
(e.g. The Tizard Hall Folk Song
Club).
One favourite argument for
the existence of Hall Soc.eties is
that it will increase participation.
It seems to me that the level of
participation is no greater than
that of the constituent College
Unions. For example, the Tizard
Buttery Hour usually only at-
tracts 20-30 out of 120.

The idea that having an account with a nation-wide ban* like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU — and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
