DAVE SMITH
Gold medal winner in the
B.U.S.F. Athletics championships
at Oxford was Dave Smith
(Triple Jump) a concrete P.G. at
I.C.. Dave, who first gained his
I.C. colours back in 1957 as an
undergraduate, was forced to
jump off a shortened run-up
owing to the proximity of the
long jump pit at the Ifley Road
track. Even so his winning jump
of 47' 10J was a personal best
an dalso a new college record.
Dave only won with this jump
because of a very sporting gest-
ure by Axell who came second
by oniy \". An unqualified by-
stander, who was acting as take-
off judge, declared Dave's leap
to be a no-jump but Axell, who
was also watching, disagreed and
after anxious high-level consult-
ation the mark was declared
valid.
Dave Smith : Gold medal winner
at Oxford

SPORT STARVED ?
The fixtures situation for I.C.
sports club could change
drastically when we become a
S.I.S.T.E.R. and may no longer
be eligible to compete in U.L.
leagues. This point was stressed
at a recent A.C.C. meeting by
president Dave Watson.
Most affected by this would
be the soccer club who have
about a dozen league matches
}lus cup matches for each of the
jeven or so teams. For the lower
teams this can be as much as
50% of the fixtures. Norman
Price, club captain, is very con-
doled about this situation which
will take a great deal of high
level diplomacy to be clarified.
One advantage, however, will
be that we may then profit from
the F.A.'s coaching scheme and
this should be a great stimulus
to the team. Particularly we
should have a great chance in
the B.U.S.F. champs.—if we are
eligible that is? This is, in fact,
one o fthe major questions to be
thrashed out.
The other big clubs would not
be in such a desparate position
since they have many inter-I.C.
games. One club with problems
would be the Sailing Club who
depend on the Welsh Harp Club
House which is owne dby U.L.
All this means that we will
have to think hard about the
future, possibly sounding out
other U.L. colleges with a view
to forming independant "London
Colleges Leagues" as at present
happens with Cross Country.
AND NOW...
The diversity of the sporting
activities recognized by the col-
lege continues to grow. This
year has heralded the birth of
the Ten Pin Bowling Club and
just recently the Water Skiing
Club.
However, whereas bowling al-
leys are comparatively easy "to
come by in the heart of London,
it is not so simple to find a good
stretch of skiing water and the
skiing club have so far had to
travel to Lowestoft for their first
outing.
The morning was mainly
taken up with land instruction,
but several runs were made in
the afternoon with varying suc-
cess.
ATHLETES
MOP UP
I.C. have done surprisingly
well this season. U.C., Q.M.C.,
L.S.E., R.A.F. Cranwell, Gold-
smiths and Bedford and County
A.C., have all been beaten.
Kings, with their' best team for
many years, just beat us by 3
points.
During the season we hav^
had three regular members of
the U.L., team: Dave Smith
(triple jump), Derek Wade (long
jump) and Leon Hall (hign
jump). This tends to emphasize
our superiority in field events,
while our performances on tne
track have been notning to shout
about.
There have been a few not-
able track performances, how-
ever. Joe Fitzsimmons won a
fine 880 years for U.L., against
the A.A.A., and Roch Basson has
taken his 440 yards time down
to 51.6 seconds. With more good
competition he should improve
this.
LEON HALL
Also jumping for London at
Oxford was Leon Hall (Physics
1) who won a silver medal in tne
high jump. After clearing 5'11"
Leon, in a gallant bid to worry
tne leader, went straight on to
attempt 6' 1"—a personal best.
But he was unsuccessful; only
failing to clear it by the narrow-
est of margins, and Campbell
(ranked 6 in G.B.) went on to
win at 6' 34/'.
In recent weeks Leon has
jumped against some of the top
jumpers in the country and tel.s
us he is looking forward to some
slightly closer competition in the
near future. This should push
him over another inch or two in
which case he will be a strong
contender for the A.A.A. Junior
championship in August.
CRICKET
C.E.M., collapsed from 120-3
to 138 all out so lost to I.C., who
had made all out in the first
round of the U.L., Cup. In the
second round they beat Batter-
sea despite losing four quick
wickets when they had only
seven runs to get.
TENNIS
I.C. had a bye in the first
round of the U.L. Cup. They
played Northampton College in
the second round on Friday. (Re-
sult in Late News).

Caving Club
DOWN GAPING GILL
Late in March, I.C. Caving
d u b spent two days under-
ground in the famous Gaping
Gill Caverns of Ingleborough in
Yorkshire. Ten o'c.ock Saturday
morning found seven well-dres-
sed cavers walking across three
miles of snow-swept limestone
plateau to the cave entrances;
tne most prominent being the
twenty-foot square shaft—down
which Fell Beck plunges 360 feet
to the floor of the Ma.\i\ Chamb-
er below. Four of the party then
descended Bar Pot via various
squeezes and a 110 foot ladder,
carrying witn them spare clothes
sleeping bags, food and cooking
gear for the underground camp.
This was set up 300 feet under-
ground in the large dry Sand
Cavern.
Meanwhile, the other three
took only 120 feet of rope and
abseiled down the six p.tches of
tne nearby Disappointment Pot.
Base Camp established, the re-
maining six cavers brought t.ie
rest of the kit, descended Bar
Pot and met the others in Sand
Cavern at five o'c.ock. Shortly
afterwards, the party of three ar-
rived havmg traversed a quarter
mile long, flat-out crawl—the
connection from the bottom of
Disappointment Pot.
Tnen everyone enjoyed a
quick meal and six hours' sleep
before two parties went explor-
ing other parts of the four miles
of cave passages. The highlight
for everyone was a visit to tne
Main Chamber, roughly the size
of St. Paul's Cathedral with the
highest waterfall in Britain fal-
ling through the hole in the roof.
One party visited East Passage
to photograph the beautiful
formations—tne only ones in the
System. The second party trav-
ersed the long, low, wet, muddy,
apt.y-named Amphibian passage
to visit the Master Cave and
terminal sump.
Tnree in the afternoon saw
everyone back in Sand Cavern
pacKing the kit ready for the
arduous climb back up Bar Pot,
but it was another two hours be-
fore everyone was out of the
cave, all agreeing that it had
been a most successful weekend.
HOCKEY: A DUTCH CUP
Our hockey team were lucky
enough to tour Holland during
the Easter Vac, and enjoy botn
genial hospitality and active
sport. During our stay we were
entertained by the Dutch Stud-
ents in Groningen whence we
visited much of Holland. We
commenced our visit by playing
four matches, winning one,
drawing one and losing two. Lat-
er we travelled to Epe to play in
a tournament and it was here
that our team spirit and hockey
ability came to tne fore,, playing
six games, winning three of
them and drawing three. Our
performance won us the Cup for
the tournament which had a
truly international flavour. The
tour was a great success, being a
mixture of good sport and
splendid entertainment and we
look forward to welcoming the
Dutch Students next year by way
of repayment.
