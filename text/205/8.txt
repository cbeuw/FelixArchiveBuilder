C A R N I V A L MAKES £ 2300
Despite a slow start the 1964 Carnival has made a profit of £2300.
This is £600 better tnan last year. Commented Treasurer Bellamy :
"We were very p.eased witn street collections—more than half of
the increased total came from them".
The Carnival Record and the Magazine "Old Rope" were both
financial disappointments, many remaining unsold.

Last Monday, the same three
anonymous re-entered the Royal
Albert Hall, during the rehears-
als for the Beat Concert. After
noting that Freddie (but not the
Dreamers) used d d Spice liber-
ally, they asked Kenny Ball
about his new disc 'Hey Dolly'.
He was glad to see Louis Arm-
strong top the Beatles in the
States, and he signed some
Carnival Records with a Kenny
Ball point pen. 20% of the Hol-
lies came up from the dressing
room. "How are y'getting on
with that Spanish bit" asked his
mate, and they signed on tne
dotted cover; likewise Billy J.
Kramer. Alan Freeman was still
wearing the same Brinyion brown
shirt that he wore at the previous
show. Even brown nylon stays
drab.

Once again, this year's Carn-
ival failed to impress its occur-
ence on to its environs. Publicity
was sparse and uninspiring,
stunts were almost non-existent.
An increased expenditure on
posters could have resulted in a
high power campaign in the
South Kensington district. It
seems strange that this was not
done.
Croquet
Perhaps lack of publicity was
t'-e lost cause of a Princes
Gardens dweller's comment on
the Fete day crowd : "But they
are all students. Students haven't
got enough money to spend to
make all that effort worthwhile!"
The Fete made £200. Patronage
from wealthy South Kensington
residents could have resulted in
it making £2000. Their absence
was not puzzling. Swinging a
pickaxe at an old car or empty-
ing buckets of water over Wat-
son are fun for the young, but
the older element have outgrown
this behaviour. A more sedate
and dignified Garden Party could
be the answer, coupled with a
much quieter atmosphere and
perhaps even—croquet.
Old Rope
The Carnival Magazine sold
badly. This was surprising
though its weakness of content
soon became widely known in
College. It seems a pity that
standards of taste have to des-
cend to the almost criminal
(Brighton) level before hot sales
result.
Big success of Carnival was the
raffle. Whether it was a result
of the gleaming car or the slick
and efficient way in which it was
administered, the profits showed
excellent improvement.
Expansion
Noticable about Carnival
organisation is that it fails to at-
tract more than a small nucleus
of highly competent personnel.
It seems ridiculous that an in-
experienced first-year Kn present
himself as a helper and then be
given a fairly responsible posit-
ion.
This situation is apparently
forced upon the executive who
find that experienced organisers
are very reticent to come for-
ward and help with Carnival.
For our effort to expand this
situation must be rectified. Per-
haps it is the image of Carnival
that needs a change.
Chairman Hodgson and his
Committee deserve credit. They
performed well, worked hard,
had some fresh ideas and suc-
ceeded in involving far more
people in the effort tnan in pre-
vious years. Congratulations!
