'ANTIYOG'
Dear Sir,
I find myself unable to ac-
cept the sentiments expressed
by 'Antiyog' in the last issue
of Fqlix. That the Carnival
Supplement "reeks of Bishop
from start to finish", as 'Anti-
yog's so charmingly puts it,
may be true; but to blame Mr.
Bishop for this is hardly log-
ical.
Mr. Bishop was a s k e d
ta write an. article covering
less than one tenth of the en-
tire Supplement. In 4his
article, he described ti pub-
licity stunt in a manner that
admirably befits a publicity
stunt. Due to the suscep-
tibility of others, who possess
no style of writing of their
own, Yogi's influence was un-
fortunately carried to other
pages. But this is the fault of
the Editor—surely not Mr,
Bishop!
'Anityog' desires "a bit less
Yog". Well, may I say just
this. Mr. Bishop was again
asked to produce a Carni-
val Record, which he did. In
order to sell the Record out-
side College, he had to spend
a week creating his own pub-
licity around South Kensing-
ton and elsewhere because the
advertising of the Carnival was
just not adequa'e. "Abit less
Yog" and there would have
been a heck of. a lot less Car-
nival since there are people
around who do nothing for so-
ciety except criticise the efforts
of others.
1 sincerely hope that this
does not include 'Antiyog'.
Yours faithfully,
M. C. Cox,
Dear Sir,
It was, indeed, most refresh-
ing to read the Editorial re-
marks which appeared in the
last issue of Felix. Of course
the Union Is dying—we all
know this, and to emphasise
this moribund slate of the
Union, Felix's columns have
carried numerous appraisals of
situation. However, I feel that
many of these have been ir-
responsibly written, but I con-
sider the latest article to be a
serious and honest attempt to
analyse the problem with
which the Union is faced. Fur-
ther, I feel that it is the truest
representation of the situation
that we have had to date. It
is certainly powerful and cour-
ageous comment to argue that
the Union is without leaders—
but how true this is\ This is
surely the root of all the
apathy about which we hear

so much. The average student,
and I speak as one, is just not
encouraged to participate
actively in Union affairs.
Every so often he will be told,
by his so called leaders, that
he fv part of the inert mass
which constitutes th? Union,
and this Union is likely to
change in character unless he
does something about it. I ob-
ject to being called apathetic
even if I am, and this sort of
verbal onslaught is not going
to entice me to seek immedi-
ate membership of clubs and
societies, in fact I shall remain
as apathetic as ever. Surely it
is up to the Union officers Jo
take the initiative here—after
all, that is why we have elected
them as our leaders. My im-
pression of Council is that it
is an autocratic hierarchy con-
sisting a set of pri-
vileged beings who are part-
icularly anxious to preserve
this image. It is a case of
"them" and "us", and we are
poles apart and do not seem
to be getting any nearer. Be-
fore the average student can
be encouraged to take an in-
terest in the Union those in
charge must sell themselves;
instead of this they seem con-
tent to strangle both them-
selves and the Union with in-
fernal red tape. The average
student must be made to feel
important and that he is
wanted, and is a valuable
member of the Union. This
can be done with "inspired"
leadership. I feel certain that
if people are persuaded enough
they will support almost any
activity. To ensure better re-
sponse the tendency to restrict
certain activities to the fav-
oured few must not be al-
lowed to continue. At present
"Mr. Average" is treated by
his leaders with inexcusable
and almost contemptible in-
difference. Until the student
body as a whole is treated with
the respect it deserves, then
there is no hope for the Union.
In conclusion, let me make
one point clear—/ do not
blame Watson, Massey or any
of the others for the fact that
they do not exhibit powers of
leadership. They are just not
given a chance under the pre-
sent system. One must respect
them for their unselfish atten-
tion to the never ending com-
mittee work, but as things
stand now, only a rebel can
succeed.
Yours,
S.G. (an average stu-
dent who is told
that he is apath-
etic.)
