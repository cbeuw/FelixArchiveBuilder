Bouncing back: new research supports rebound sex

The preferred option for some females rebounding at Imperial
D
ubbed ‘Female Viagra’,
the drug Lady Prelox has
gone on sale in the UK
this week, marketed as
being ‘clinically proven’
to improve female sexual dysfunction.
Whether or not it works is another
matter.
Despite the marketing, Lady Prelox
is not related to Viagra, but is a new
version of Prelox, a combination of
L-arginine and a pine bark extract
called pycnogenol. Prelox has been
used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED)
and has shown some efectiveness.
he main diferences between the
male and female version of Prelox
are a lower dose of L-arginine and
the colour of the pills – in a stunning
display of gender stereotyping, Lady
Prelox is pink and Prelox is blue.
Blood low to the penis is the
driving force behind an erection. To
increase low, blood vessels within
the penis dilate, allowing more blood
in. his vasodilatation is due to the
action of nitric oxide (NO), which is
produced from L-arginine. Viagra
works downstream of NO by blocking
the efects of an enzyme that switches
of the pathway turned on by NO.
L-arginine supplements have been
shown to improve the symptoms
of ED, but in a weak and highly
dose-dependent way. Assuming
vasodilatation is important for female
sexual function, the lower dose
present in Lady Prelox (200 mg versus
700 mg) could render it less efective.
he other ingredient in Prelox,
pycnogenol, stimulates e-NOS, the
enzyme responsible for producing
NO from L-arginine. his leads
to a synergistic efect between the
two ingredients, with pycnogenol
increasing the activity of e-NOS and
the L-arginine giving the enzyme the
substrate it needs. In a very small
(21 people) clinical trial, there is an
improvement in male sexual function
compared to placebo, measured by
responses to a questionnaire.
Unfortunately, this trial and all
others investigating the efects of
Prelox on ED have been small in
size (under 50 patients). Some of the
trials did not compare the efects of
Prelox to anything else, meaning the
improvement could simply be thanks
to the placebo efect.
In a clinical trial of Lady Prelox on
100 women aged 37-45, all patients
were given a management plan,
consisting of changes to lifestyle, diet,
exercise and stress control. Half the
women were also given Lady Prelox.
Both groups showed increased sexual
function, with a larger increase in the
group taking Prelox. As the control
group were not given anything in
place of Prelox, this diference could
once again simply be down to the
placebo efect.
Another trial, on post-menopausal
women, gave an improvement in
sexual function compared to placebo.
H o w e v e r,
this trial
was only
s i n g l e -
b l i n d ,
m e a n i n g
that whilst
the patients
did not
know which
treatment
they were
g e t t i n g ,
the doctors
running the
trial did.
Not only
that, but
unlike the
causes of
male ED,
the causes
of female
s e x u a l
dysfunction
are unclear.
Whilst there is an increase in genital
blood low during arousal, whether
improving this low leads to an
improvement in sexual function is not
known.
If sexual dysfunction is
psychological, improving blood low
will not help. Prelox, like Viagra,
requires the user to be aroused and
so as Dr Graham Jackson, chairman
of the Sexual Advice Association, told
the Daily Mail, “if you’re not turned on
by your partner, no amount of tablets
will help.”
he results of the trials of this
supplement have been covered in
the Daily Mail, the Telegraph, and on
websites around the world. As with
many science articles in the news,
there is an acceptance of the results
of the clinical trials without critically
appraising the methods. his problem
is by no means unique to this pill or
these articles, which do point out
I
t’s oicial: the popular belief that
people who have been dumped
are more likely to have “rebound”
sex is true, at least among
students.
Lynne Cooper and Lindsey Barber
at the University of Missouri followed
the lives of 170 undergraduates who
had recently been through a break-
up, asking them to keep a diary of
their feelings, sexual experiences and
motivations over a period of twelve
weeks.
hey found that within four weeks of
the break-up, one third of participants
had sex, with 35% claiming it was to
get over their previous relationship
and 25% claiming it was a form of
revenge.
hough there are many common
perceptions about rebound sex – with
tomorrow, the day after Valentine’s
Day, being considered “rebound day”
according to Urban Dictionary – there
had been scant previous research into
this behaviour.
he study also found that people
who had been dumped were more
likely to have sex than those who
initiated the break-up, and more
commonly said that they used sex as
a coping mechanism. hese people
also sufered more distress. “People
really do use sex as a way to get over
or get back at their ex-partner in the
aftermath of a breakup,” said Lynne
Cooper.
he frequency of rebound sex
levelled of over time: ive months after
the break-up, dumped participants
were no more likely to
use sex to cope than their
former partner; however,
those who did have sex
as a coping mechanism
immediately after the
break-up were more likely
to have sex with strangers
for a longer period.
he study claims that
“people are more likely to
have sex for a variety of
maladaptive reasons in the
aftermath of a romantic
relationship breakup
especially if they were
“dumped” or were in a
highly committed or long-
standing relationship.”
“[his] data provides
clear support for common
rebound lore, suggesting that people
do indeed use sex in the aftermath of a
breakup to help them cope with their
feelings of distress and to get over or
get back at their ex-partners.”

that the biology behind female sexual
dysfunction is still unclear.
Overall, this supplement seems to
be a weaker, pink version of a pill that
may help treat erectile dysfunction,
being marketed to treat something
with an unknown biological basis in
women based on two small, unreliable
clinical trials. If you’d like some, it
costs £37.95 for a month’s supply, and

would love to hear all about it.
