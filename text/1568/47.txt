With less than 3 months left of the sea-
son, James White predicts where each
of the 20 Barclays Premier League
teams can expect to inish.
Arsenal – heir drubbing at Anield
aside, the Gunners have so far man-
aged to avoid their usual post-Christ-
mas slump. But they have a horriic
run of ixtures ahead and often fall
short in matches against direct title
rivals. 3rd
Aston Villa – Although relatively
young and inexperienced, the Villans
have an astute manager in Paul Lam-
bert. Unlike most relegation candi-
dates, they have the guile to beat any
side on their day. 10th
Cardif – Dispensing of Malky Mac-
kay’s services was a big mistake. Ol’
Gunnar Solskjaer has no experience of
a relegation battle and the Bluebirds
look very short up front. 20th
Chelsea – he competition is ierce
this year and they lack a reliable out-
and-out striker to inish sides of, but
Jose Mourinho has won a title or two
in his time and the Blues are my fa-
vourites for the title. 1st
Crystal Palace – Tony Pulis has stead-
ied the ship and transformed Palace’s
defence. hey are short up front but
know how to grind out a 1-0 win at
home when they need to and should
be more than OK. 14th
Everton – Roberto Martinez has sur-
passed all expectations since taking
over at Goodison Park but the Tofees
have looked distinctly beatable in re-
cent weeks and are probably slightly
overachieving. 7th
Fulham – he Cottagers look like a
Sunday league side at times. here
may be the old heads needed to han-
dle a relegation battle but barring their
draw at Old Traford, recent perfor-
mances suggest a desperate shortage
of quality. 19th
Hull – Steve Bruce’s Tigers have de-
served to stay clear of the relegation
places so far, but it will be a tall order
for them to keep it up for 11 more
games. hey are in for a nervy inish
but should just have enough to sur-
vive. 17th
Liverpool – With Luis Suarez and
Daniel Sturridge iring on all cylin-
ders, and astute, level-headed Brendan
Rodgers at the helm, the Reds are
inally equipped to make their long-
awaited return to the top four. 4th
Man City – Manuel Pellegrini’s side
possess one of the most potent attacks
in Europe but still have questions to
answer defensively. Although their re-
cent form is doubtless just a blip, they
cannot aford it and may have to settle
for a runners up spot. 2nd
Man United – Teams play the Red
Devils expecting to get a result, so
David Moyes is up against it in every
game. Even with van Persie and Roon-
ey back in contention, I think they
might just fall short of Europe. 6th
Newcastle – It is just as well for the
Magpies that they are 10 points clear
of the bottom half as they have noth-
ing left to play for this season and
for that reason will probably not win
many more games. 9th
Norwich – Chris Hughton always
manages to get a result when he needs
it, but the Canaries are joint second
lowest scorers in the division and
short of quality. heir run-in is hor-
riic and this will go down to the wire.
18th
Southampton – Although like New-
castle, the Saints have nothing to play
for in the league, Mauricio Pochet-
tino’s side enjoy their football, playing
with real lair, and can climb up a place
or two. 8th
Stoke – he Potters will be alright as
the Britannia Stadium remains a hard
place to visit, although their away
form is dismal and they are struggling
to adapt to Mark Hughes’ more free-
lowing style. 12th
Sunderland – It is diicult to fault the
Black Cats’ performances and in Gus
Poyet they have a manager who will
never lie down. Strong both at home
and away of late, I fancy them to inish
well clear of the drop. 11th
Swansea – Michael Laudrup’s sack-
ing sums up a miserable season so
far. hey lack a cutting edge but judg-
ing by their win versus Cardif, Garry
Monk has the players’ respect so they
should be ine. 13th
Tottenham – Spurs look set to push
the sides above them for a Champions
League spot, and I expect Tim Sher-
wood to keep up his strong start, but
they are not proliic enough at home
and may have to settle for the Europa
League again. 5th
West Brom – Pepe Mel’s Baggies have
already picked up solid draws against
Liverpool and Everton and although
they seldom win, they have the quality
to keep nicking points here and there
so should survive. 16th
West Ham – Credit to Sam Allardyce
that the Hammers are not rock bot-
tom given the horriic run of injuries
he has had. Big Sam knows how to win
a relegation tussle and has big players
returning all the time. 15th
After a long series of consecutive
triumphs over a bunch of teams of
absolutely negligible importance
(amongst which was our own 1s),
Imperial 2nd XI took on a group
of amateur medical students who
sometimes get together and pretend
to know how to play football. Long
story short, it turns out King’s is
actually a real university and has a real
football team.
he view of 11 red-shirted herculean
men shrugging the chilly British rain
of their shoulders was almost enough
for the wannabe jobless surgeons to
change their mind about the game. It
took them about an hour and a half
to stop shaking in terror and actually
show up on the pitch.
With a lovely wind blowing on our
backs we kick of, a leet of Airborne
Rangers handling balls better than
Will Batchelor’s belt. After 15
minutes in which the biggest danger
in Imperial’s half was a gust of wind
messing up Sam homas’ hair, the
well-deserved irst goal on the game
arrived from none other than Mic
Tonutti’s magical left foot: lying like
a hawk on Maizonnier’s low corner, a
lick with the tip of the foot from the
front post left the keeper seriously
considering a career in low-proile
prostitution. After a few more minutes
of champagne football, Will Wilson
found the bottom corner from outside
the box, taking advantage of a hole in
King’s defence as easy to wade into as
our beloved yanks every Wednesday
night. 2-0 wasn’t enough though;
after a few unrealistic attempts at
penetrating the fortress of Imperial’s
defence, another masterpiece from
the best Italian left back since Fabio
Grosso in the 2006 World Cup led to
an unassailable lead. A lucky save on
Miles Cover’s header allowed Tonutti
to release a light-speed bullet right
below the crossbar. 3-0 at halftime,
just as King’s ginger striker started
looking for his self-esteem in the ield
across the road.
In the second half, Imperial’s best
team perfectly controlled the game,
with no danger seen around Sam
Mason’s goal. A strong drive from 25
yards by Andy SB left the base of the
post shaking, much like the linesmen
in these terrible conditions. Tactics
changed rapidly, with the aim being to
stretch the pitch and get the wingers’
boots as white as Smithy’s wallet.
IC saw out the game in comfortable
fashion, creating chances on the
counter as they wished and laughing
at how useless the opposition were.

Cries of “Who is this person?!” were
aimed at their star players, who could
only responded with “I broke my back.
My back… is broken.”
Normal service has been resumed
at Fortress H this term, helping the
2s extend their winning streak to
4 games. On this glorious road of
victories, 16 goals have been scored,
a single goal conceded and Scatman
has reigned supreme in the changing
room. Victory was celebrated under a
relentless rain of Americans and beer,
with a late title surge taking shape. Be-
bah-bah-bada-bom!!!

Imperial Eagles celebrate
double against Middlesex
T
he Eagles started where
they left of and extended
their unbeaten run in the
London University Sports
League with 2 victories
against Middlesex.
he ixture in January was the irst
match for IC after the holidays, and
the performance was everything but
encouraging. Sloppy passing, passive
defending and careless individual
errors meant that the Eagles were
unable to adhere to their game-plan.
Very rarely were the players on the
back position allowed to co-ordinate
their eforts in attack, and some
rather unconventional attacking by
Middlesex, paired with a big portion of
luck, continuously troubled Imperial.
What followed was a hectic, disrupted
and chaotic game, in which individual
experience and skill quickly became
the decisive factor. he fact that
Imperial got away with a 48:24 victory
is testament to the poor defending and
served as the much need wake-up call
before the University Championship
Qualiiers in February.
Due to a late cancellation and some
ad-hoc reshuling of the ixture list,
Imperial got the chance to face the
same opponents only one week later
and show that they had learned and
had grown from the experience.
he Eagles, despite a shaky start,
were in control of the game from
the irst minute and used their usual
counter-attacking style to undo their
opponents.
Once a big margin had been
established, the game calmed down a
bit and Imperial were inally able to
practice attack from more structured
attacks and set pieces. After 60
minutes, the Eagles claimed a 14:51
victory – their highest win in club
history. Club President Rishi De-
Kayne, who was unable to attend
the second ixture, was pleased to
hear about the improvement and
celebrated the victory with a half-pint
of shandy.
In an earlier ixture on the same
day, UCL lost to Brunel University
in a dramatic game that ended
UCL’s unbeaten run and set up a
highly charged central London derby
between two traditional rivals this
week. Whichever team secures a
victory in this game could have a big
part to play in the title showdown.
It will also be an early indication of
either team’s chances in the “group of
death” at the regional qualiiers for the
University Championships in which
3 of the 4 best teams in the country
are set to face each other and several
other strong title-contenders in the
earliest stage of the competition.
Stefan Bauer describes the action as the Eagles register victories.
