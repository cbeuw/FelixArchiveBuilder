Will Hunter discusses the new robots that can feel human emotions
A
recent advancement
by scientists at
Lincoln University
shows positive signs
of developing robots
that can help humans to build and
establish longer-term emotional
relationships with them. And in
doing so, may also overcome certain
thought-biases established in the
human psyche. With the ability to
express ive simple emotions, this new
technology could see our reaction to
humanoid robotics possibly shift from
revulsion to attraction.
ERWIN (Emotional Robot with
Intelligent Network) the robot is
the latest venture in civilization’s
obsession with developing
increasingly humanlike robots. By
applying a set of “cognitive biases” (a
series simplistic personality traits) the
team have managed to give ERWIN a
set of characteristics deemed ‘human’.
PhD student, Mriganka Biswas,
explains that personality – quite
obviously – has a huge inluence on
the way in which we develop human-
to-human relationships with each
other. Implanting a similar set of
characteristics to ours, into robots
should hopefully have the same efects
on human-to-robot relationships.
he researchers hope that not only
will their work help to build better
and more realistic relationships
between humans and companion
robots (those used by the elderly or
disabled for support), but also help
psychologists to better understand
how relationships are formed by
children who sufer from austism and
Asperger’s syndrome.
With this being the Science Sex
issue however, we’re not interested
in these quite sweet, extremely
promising applications. Instead we
want to explore whether there might
be further, more sordid use for this
technology.
Could we see this relatively innocent
and revolutionary technology being
high-jacked by those contributing to
the development of sex bots or other
technologies shown to be popular in
the otaku communities of Japan?
Back in November all it took for
designers to bring sexual gratiication
by robots to the male masses was
an immersive headset, some pretty
graphic Hentai animations and
a rather substantial looking lesh
light. he romantics among us will
agree that there is one thing missing
from this scenario. hey’ve certainly
mimicked the physical aspects of a
sexual relationship but where are the
emotional connections?
A happy ending requires far more
than just a couple of pneumatic ist
pumps and a bit of gentle monotone
moaning.
Most will argue that building a
romantic and responsive relationship
with your partner leads to a far more
important and gratifying experience
between the sheets. Now that we’re
taking steps towards building robots
that can express and perceive emotion
can we think about making the sex bot
fantasy, a reality?
