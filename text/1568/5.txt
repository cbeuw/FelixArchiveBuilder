T
he government has
announced that it will be
cutting £946 million from its
annualgranttoEnglishHigher
Education Institutions. In
the latest its grant letter to the Higher
Education Funding Council for England
(HEFCE) the Department for Business,
Innovation & Skills announced that its
inal recurrent grant to the sector for
the 2014-2015 academic year will be
£3.6 billion. his is some £125 million
less than the estimate 2014-2015
funding that was announced in last
year’s grant letter.
In a letter to HEFCE, Business
Secretary Vince Cable and Universities
Minister David Willetts wrote that
“in the context of stretched public
inances, it has been necessary to
make reductions to the indicative
recurrent teaching budget for 14-15”
and conirmed that “further recurrent
savings will be required in 15-16”
.
Ministers have not dictated in which
speciic areas these cuts should be
made, indicating that it should be up
to HEFCE “to take decisions on how
you allocate [their] budgets”
. hey have,
however, indicated that savings should
be made “in ways that protect as far as
possible high cost subjects (including
STEM), widening participation and
small and specialist institutions”
. Cable
and Willets have also indicated that
cuts should be made to the salaries of
senior University management igures,
saying that they “want to see leaders
in the sector exercise much greater
restraint as part of continuing to hold
down increases”
.
While the government forecasts
that their cuts will be more than
compensated by increased tuition fee
income and while research funding
has been protected there are concerns
that the changes will afect the poorest
students the worst. In addition to the
cuts in the Higher Education grant
the Government will be scrapping
the Access to Learning Fund and
halving the budget for the National
ScholarshipProgrammeto£50million.
he Government has indicated that
“the new funding system places
greater responsibility on institutions
to fund access and retention activities,
including supporting students in cases
of hardship.”
Responding to the changes, Shadow
Universities Minister Liam Byrne said:
“Today’s announcement lays bare the
black hole ministers have created in
student funding. … he fact that cuts
are being targeted at support for the
poorest students at university and the
skills budget tells you everything you
need to know about this government’s
values and their ambitions for Britain’s
future.
“I’mgladthatmonthsofcampaigning
andpressurebyLabourandothershave
prevented the government axing the
student opportunity fund – but cuts
to the lifeline that keeps the poorest
students at work and a huge 20% cut
to the skills budget risk throwing social

mobility in our country into reverse at
the very time we need to earn our way
out of the cost of living crisis.”
Other responses also voiced similar
concerns. Professor Michael Gunn,
Chair of the think tank million+
expressed relief that the cuts were
not as bad as had been expected. In
a statement he said, “his is a victory
for common sense although it is still
disappointing that the overall grant is
being cut. Higher education should be
seen as an investment in the future and
not a cost to be constantly trimmed.
he balance of responsibility for the
fundingofhighereducationhasalready
shifted substantially to graduates and
there are very good arguments for
Britain to emulate our competitors and
invest more in both higher education
teaching and research.”
Professor Sir Christopher Snowden,
President of Universities UK – a
body representing the leaders of 133
UK Higher Education institutions –
indicated that he believed that the
Government was undervaluing British
universities saying, “Universities are
good for the economy, society and
individuals. hey drive economic
growth and innovation, support social
mobility and are inding solutions
to the major challenges facing our
society. Other major economies are
investing in their universities, and the
UK should be investing to support
research and teaching if we want to
increase growth and stay globally
competitive.”
He added, “We are pleased that,
as far as possible, high cost subjects
(including STEM), widening
participation and small and specialist
institutions are to be protected but
we fail to see how the projected cuts
for 2014-15, and the more substantial
projected cuts for 2015-16, can be
delivered without reducing allocations
intheseareas.Universitieshavealready
shouldered substantial reductions
in public funding for both teaching
and research in recent years and have
made £1.38 billion in eiciency savings
already. … It is right that Government
has maintained the science and
research ring fence. However, we need
a long-term plan to increase research
funding above inlation if we are to
remain competitive. We already invest
too little in research compared with
other developed nations.”
he grant letter was received more
positively by the Russell Group of
elite, research intensive universities,
with Director General Dr Wendy Piatt
saying: “We are pleased that ministers
have maintained their commitment
to university research, which is so
critically important. HEFCE’s funding
underpins research excellence in the
UK. Wealsowelcometheconirmation
of the Government’s stated promise
to increase funding to universities for
teaching high cost science courses, as
well as essential funding for teaching
capital.”
he terms of the grant letter do not
apply to Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, which have devolved
responsibilities for University funding.
