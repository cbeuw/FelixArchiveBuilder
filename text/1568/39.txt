Veliko Tarnovo
By Akanksha Garg
W
e arrived at Soia Airport,
shattered from our
midnight travels from
Heathrow to Bulgaria. On landing,
we were shocked at the rain and cold
weather, having had only packed
shorts anticipating the very welcome
30-degree heat. he coach ride from
Soia to Veliko Tarnovo was about
ive hours long, and we were worried
about commuting, reading and
speaking the Bulgarian language. We
managed to make our way from Soia
to Veliko Tarnovo, and for the irst
time experienced the beauty of the
undiscovered Bulgarian landscapes.
When we reached Veliko Tarnovo,
we were surprised by how big it was,
mainly because everyone told us it was
a very small town. We were greeted
by Katia, the ICAB representative,
at the station. She had arranged our
accommodation and gave us the
necessary information and helped
to make us feel welcome and settled.
Our accommodation was accessible
by climbing what felt like a million
lights of stairs, which from then on
made up our daily exercise. We moved
into a tiny little house on a top of a
hill, which gave a lovely view of the
new city from our garden. On our irst
night in Veliko Tarnovo, we decided
to go explore the city and discovered
food was very cheap and only cost
about £6 for a pretty big meal.
After a brief training session
with Katia and meeting our lovely
translator, we went to the orphanage
in Balvan, a small town that was about
twenty minutes from Veliko Tarnovo
by bus. It was completely secluded,
with two shops and a single school.
We were apprehensive about how we
would communicate and entertain
thirty children, all from a diferent
culture, and with most being teenaged
boys with whom we didn’t share much
in common.
hey were, however, very excited
to meet us, and we started the day
by playing a few group games to get
to know everyone. As days passed in
the orphanage, we got to know each
child personally, some opening up
faster than others. We discovered
that their favourite pastime was just
running around and playing outdoors.
he older children were content
by themselves but joined in group
activities. hey were huge fans of
freerunning and parkour, and really
enjoyed showing us their dangerous-
looking tricks. hey also loved taking
photos of themselves!
Some of the activities we organized
included playing with balls, gold
clubs, skipping ropes, planting pots,
face painting, and group games. We
did notice that the children didn’t
want to preserve the toys: they played
with them for about ten minutes
before they were broken. On our last
day in Veliko Tarnovo, we organised
a party which was joint with a three-
year-old boy’s birthday party. his was
truly a wonderful way to say goodbye,
as the whole orphanage got together
and played some games, danced and
enjoyed party food.
During our time of, we went to
the nearby church and walked past
Tsarevets Castle. he old town itself
was a sight to visit with paved streets
adorned with tourist shops selling
proud Bulgarian souvenirs. here
were plenty of restaurants and bars
in the old city that ofered breath-
taking views of the mountain ranges
and valleys, especially around sunset.
On the Saturday, we accompanied
Veliko Tarnovo orphanage on a ive
kilometre trek to the mountain area
where there was a competition for
children. Children took part in a
variety of sporting activities and we
cheered them on and enjoyed the
scenery.
Our week at Veliko Tarnovo and
Balvan orphanage was really diferent
to anything anticipated. It was a shock
at irst having thirteen year old boys
running around and tickling you, but
after a while we became one of them
and really enjoyed out time playing
and bonding with the children.
Varna

H
aving come straight from
historic Veliko Tarnovo, where
we always had a translator
and guide, we were a little more wary
when we arrived in Varna. We had
been in contact with a representative
from the orphanage where we would
be working, but she had not arranged
any accommodation and simply
expected us to turn up to work the
next morning.
Varna was a reasonably large coastal
town, a popular seaside destination
among the Balkan countries. We
stayed at a very sociable youth hostel
we had reserved in advance, where
staf were helpful in guiding and
advising us as well as entertaining
their guests in the evenings.
he orphanage was a mixture of
children who lived there, and Romany
children who came in either every
morning or every afternoon for a
session. hey were boys and girls aged
ive to ifteen, although most were
quite young. At Gavroche, they played
games outdoors in the play area as
well as indoors, and we found that the
children especially enjoyed colouring
and painting. We had taken a range of
toys with us that all proved popular:
the biggest hits were face paints.
On some evenings the children
received lessons in swimming and
martial arts, and we were welcome
to stay and watch. All of the children,
lacking in attention and activities,
were quick to bond with us and ight
each other for personal attention.
hey were friendly and eager to
participate in any activity we decided
to organise, although this was easier
said than done as nobody spoke any
English! Our representative was not
present on all days at all times, and
we were mostly just left to ourselves,
able to come and go as we pleased.
Our usual weekday schedule was from
about 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and we were
not expected to come on weekends.
he evenings and weekends were
easily illed as Varna is a typical beach
tourist destination. he pedestrianised
road leading up to the beach is illed
with ice cream, slushie and sweet
corn (a really popular roadside snack
in Bulgaria, it seems) carts, and the
beach itself is beautifully sandy and
full of beach bars and restaurants.
here is a dolphinarium that is
worth a visit if you haven’t been to
one before and have the time, and
the archaeological museum if you
have the patience. here is also a free
walking tour of Varna that runs every
day with locals who volunteer, which
is a great way to start your week – a
deinite recommendation. Free time
can also be spent by taking a walk
along the sea garden: this is just
adjacent to the beach, and great when
you need some shade in the very hot
climes of Bulgarian summers.
he restaurants by the seaside were
expensive by Bulgarian standards (but
still pretty good compared to the UK),
but we found some places popular
with the locals where the food was
better and the prices were cheaper.
he most famous of these is probably
Alba, which is easily recognisable by
its bright green exterior. One night
we went to a local beach club with
the staf from our hostel and the other
guests, which it made for a pretty good
night out. Just be wary of the mastika!
