WELLBEING
As part of Imperial College Union’s Stress Less program, we’ve been encouraging
people to let go of their worries and get creative with free Arts and Crafts
sessions. If you haven’t been able to make it to one of these sessions, now is
your chance to get involved!
This page is a blank canvas for your doodles and drawings. In the spirit of
Valentine’s Day, the most romantic doodle tweeted @feliximperial will win a
mystery Valentine’s-themed prize.
