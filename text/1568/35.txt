Find the egg-laying chicken
ME: Introduce yourself:
MR: My name is Michael Rolph, I
am the co-founder of Yoyo which
has launched very recently here at
Imperial.
ME: What is the history of Yoyo,
how did you guys start out?
MR: I’ve got a personal background
which is very much from the payment
space. Ex-Barclaycard Business, First
Data, Paypal and I’ve spent the last
three or so years prior to Yoyo both as
an investor and advisor in the inancial
technology space, speciically helping
large corporations think about how
they innovate in payments. I’ve been
quite privileged to see a lot of what
goes on out there. My two co-founders
are equally serial entrepreneurs:
Alain Falys was the founder of OB10
and Dave Nicholson founded Zopa,
and both of them were talking about
mobile payments. I’ve been from the
space and every day I heard for the
last 15 years or so about how mobile
is going to be the future of payments.
he reality is that this time last year,
when the three of us got together,
the conclusion was that there was
nothing out there. here is a lot of
talk about people like Google, Paypal
and whoever else, but you realise that
there is nothing there. here’s lots of
startups that have tried to do mobile
payments but nothing has stuck.
So the conclusion we got to was
the that the only thing that looked
interesting was Starbucks app. 13% of
all their sales in the US and UK come
from mobile devices. It was the one
shining light, so we looked at their
app in quite a bit of detail, as much
as we could and we came to a few
conclusions. Firstly, it was not built
for purpose, it was just an extension
of their pre-paid program. he other
part of it was, actually, it got pretty
bad pretty quickly. You get the instant
stamp, but if you get enough stamps
to get a reward, they send you the
reward as a paper voucher to your
home address. hat is just insane.
hen when it comes to ofers, there
is no context, there is no relevance to
the ofer they are sending you based
on what you like and what you buy. So
we quickly said, it’s really interesting,
it works, it’s adding some value but
there is a lot that could be better. Our
starting point then became: Starbucks
but better. So that’s how we came
about.
ME: I know you have a link with
Imperial Innovations, how did that
start/work out?
MR: Alain [Falys] was actually
a Venture Partner at Imperial
Innovations and when we all three
came together it felt quite natural that
we should meet there. Innovations
have been very early supporters of us
as a team. We were unique and quite
diferent from a lot of people who had
tried this before and failed, because
we were from the space and we are
not a traditional set of entrepreneurs,
as we are not irst time entrepreneurs.
We also had good connections in the
retail space and we had a good view
of it. So they supported us early on to
make it [Yoyo] our full time job, as it
were. So since September last year, all
three of us have been really focused on
Yoyo.
ME: So, I am also quite aware that
you are active in other universities,
why target universities and
students?
MR: Launching something that
changes, or gives someone the ability
to change their behaviour, as mobile
does, is not easy because you’ve got
a two-headed beast to tackle. You’ve
got to get the consumers, the users, as
well as the retailer. he whole industry
talks about this chicken and egg
situation, but in my mind if you’ve ind
the thing that looks like the chicken
that laid the irst egg that then became
the chicken, then its a pretty obvious
point that you can do something with
it. So we started of at universities,
just as it worked for Facebook. What
we are building here is a consumer
network, and from that perspective,
you need to get your critical mass
pretty quickly, get some momentum.
Equally you need to solve a problem,
and when you think about what
we’ve really done, even if we forget
what Yoyo is going to do in the retail
space, there are some real annoyances
around paying and loyalty aspects in
any closed campus environment that
we addressed. Most would say, either
you have to pay by cash or you’ve
got to use some kind of closed-loop
prepaid card, which you have to top
up, and that can become quite a pain.
So although payment isn’t
broken, there are a number of small
annoyances like queueing for an ATM,
having to deal with change, having to
wait in a queue whilst someone mucks
around with getting the right change
or dropping their money, whatever it
may be, that if you eliminate would
make everything much easier and
we’ve done that in a very simple way.
ME: Now, more specific to Imperial,
at the moment you are linked to
Taste Imperial, are you planning to
branch out to the Union?
MR: We are currently integrating
into the Union, and at some point in
February we expect to be there. We
are actually testing today. We expect
tobe up and running within fourteen
days or so.
ME: At the moment it is only
with Taste Imperial (food related
establishments) are you planning
anything with the gifts shop at
Imperial for example?
MR: he only thing that currently isn’t
able to accept Yoyo, or going to accept
Yoyo within February are the shops,
but we will bring the shops on board
as well.
ME: In terms of features, is there
anything that you are planning to
release?
MR: he next release will include
things like PIN-entry for access to the
app, it will include automated top-up,
and a whole bunch of things around
the rewards, sort of Yoyo speciic
rewards but actually what we’ve got
here is the irst release, so we are
actually building version 2, that will
bring in things like being able to share
rewards with friends for example.
ME: Currently you are only on
Android and iOS, are you planning
anything Windows?
MR: We will do a Windows
application, probably towards the
end of this year. We built something
for Apple and Android, not because
it’s not necessarily easier, but because
that’s 95% of the market. However
universities are actually one of the
only areas where Windows has a
proportionately higher share, so it is
deinitely on our list of things to do.
ME: Also you work with QR codes
right now, what about NFC?
MR: he reason we work with QR
codes, is because it is the easiest thing
for a retailer. It works with all their
existing hardware, the only thing we
have to help them with is the scanners,
but that’s relatively easy. As for NFC,
we are not adverse to it, we are actually
technology agnostic at the front end,
so if NFC did become the norm, then
absolutely we would make it part of
the every-day experience of Yoyo.
ME: Do you see contactless cards as
a competitor to Yoyo?
MR: No. A lot of people have issues
Max Eggl talks to one of the Yoyo founders Michael Rolph,
on the merits of mobile and future plans of Yoyo at Imperial
The whole industry
talks about this
chicken and egg
situation, but in my
mind if you’ve find
the thing that looks
like the chicken that
laid the first egg
that then became
the chicken, then
its a pretty obvious
point that you can do
something with it.
