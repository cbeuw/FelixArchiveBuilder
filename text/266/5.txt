black
dwarf
Ken Garrett and Pat Rotherham visit the editorial offices of
the Black Dwarf.
Before Sunday's demonstration, Felix visited The
Black Dwarf, the radical newspaper edited by ' Tariq Ali.
Ali himself was away speaking in Nottingham, and we
spoke to two Dwarf workers.
Home Issues
Perhaps the most import-
ant point is that the Dwarf
would like to see the demon-
stration more concerned
with home issues—such as
housing, unemployment,
and the wage freeze. This
must happen if the public is
not to be alienated by un-
necessary violence in demos
against an abstract issue, as
Vietnam is to people living
in England. L^nners carried
on the march will emphasise
this point. For Vietnam is
seen as a more obvious ex-
ample of the oppression
which exists in all capitalist
(the West), or bureaucratic
(the USSR), societies. " The
Vietnamese are the same as
us but have to use different
weapons. We must use
strikes and demos." They
claim, with some justice,
that this is a repressive so-
ciety for those who dissent
from it, citing times when
they have been " leant on "
by the police.
Police =
Violence
Of course, the police, be-
ing the most obvious mani-
festation of repression in any
state, come in for a great
deal of criticism. Felix
suggested that their presence
at demos is mainly for the
protection of property. The
Dwarf disagrees with this.
One of them told us "I
know for a fact that there
are two thousand police
volunteers in South East
England, ready for Sunday."
In fact, they are certain that
there would be no viofcnee if
there were so police present;
they also agreed that this
could not be guaranteed, "If
the police slop us going
where wc want to go, it is
provocation and there will
be violence." If the police
were not there, would Dow-
ning Street, for instance, be
safe? " If anyone goes into
Downing Street, they want
their head examined--it's a
cul-de-sac, and you can get
cut off and have hell thum-
ped out of you."
Biased
Press
The people we spoke to
both said they were person-
ally opposed to the use of
violence; nonetheless they
expected it on Sunday. They
place a large amount of
blame on the popular press,
in particular the Evening
News. Their advice was
not to provoke or become
involved in unnecessary vio-
lence. "Necessary violence"
apparently means rescuing
people from arrest.
Provocation
One can make out quite a
good case for provoking the
police to violence in order
to demonstrate clearly the
repressive nature of capital-
ist society, which is other-
wise quite subtle in its me-
ihods. The Dwarf agreed
that this could be a legiti-
mate aim for a demo, but
denied that it was any part
of the plan for Sunday.
Brain-
Washing
Some kind of revolution
is necessary in this country.
Many people at IC must feci
the futility of becoming but
a cog in the vast business
machine—yet capitalist so-
ciety would trammel their
life down the smooth chan-
nels it has prepared for it.
The chief agents in this are
the mass media, the " brain
police," who would stifle
any attempt at true freedom.
And Finally:
Vietnam
The Vietnam issue has
become the international
mobiliser of left-wing mili-
tancy. At the Dwarf they
believe that change is not
possible through evolution
of present systems, and that
conditions are becoming
right for social revolution,
as nearly happened in
France last May. Whether
or not their way is the right
one we cannot say. Per-
haps things will seem clearer
by the time you read this.
FELIX D E R I D E D
BY N A T I O N A L S
An article misinterpret-
ing the account in the last
issue of FELICITY of IC's
intention to set up an emer-
gency office during Sunday's
demonstration appeared in
the Evening News last week.
The article appeared as fol-
lows :
" An emergency office for
militant left-wingers who
may be arrested in the de-
monstrations is being set up
at Imperial College, South
Kensington. Information on
where to phone is given in
a broadsheet included in this
week's issue of FELIX, the
College student magazine.
A broadsheet on legal'rights
will also be available."
The Daily Mirror and Daily
Express carried similar
articles.
Correction
Refused
An impromptu meeting of
I.C. executive was called at
lunchtime last Wednesday
and following this Rex
Lowin sent a letter to the
Evening News repeating the
reasons for setting up the
office and stressing that it
was set up to provide advice
for students from I.C., "not
to protect them from the
course of the Law." When
Rex and Jane Pearson went
to see the Managing Editor
of the " News," he refused
to correct the erroneous im-
pression given in their ar-
ticle and would not publish
the letter.
FELIX wishes to empha-
sise that the article in ques-
tion made clear that the
office was open only to give
advice to Imperial College
students and not to students
in general as the " News "
article implies. FELIX also
condemns the Evening News
for twisting the facts printed
in FELICITY and forgiving
the impression that LC. is a
hotbed ef militant Maoism.
What could be further from
the truth!
EXEC
CLOCKS
OUT
At a recent meeting of the
Executive a request that the
Union clocks be stopped for
a short period as part of the
publicity campaign for
PHOENIX was refused.
Part of the advertising
theme, "Time stops for
Phoenix " was deemed as,
" Silly anvway."
Well now! "People in glass
houses . . .

The motion : This house
believes that negotiations
achieve more than militant
student demonstrations, was
overwhelmingly defeated at
the last I.C. debate. Interest
in the motion ceatred
around the two main speak-
ers, Peter Watherson (Presi-
dent of L.S.E. during the
sit-in) and David Triesman
(expelled from Essex last
session).
Mr. Watherson, propos-
ing the motion, felt that the
present awareness of the
inadequacies of higheivedu-
cation was not confinedVto a
minority of activities and all
reforms had so far been
achieved by hard bargain-
ing in negotiations. He made
special mention of the re-
cent N.U.S.—Vice-Chancel-
lor report.
The proposer thought the
value of the L.S.E. sit-in
had been nil insofar as no
real reforms were gained by-
it, and subsequent student
representation on commit-
tees in the school were solely
the results of negotiations.
He then went on to attack
the militant students for not
attaining anything, and felt
that many demonstrations
took place only to give new
experiences to the students.
In a long, wide ranging
and often witty speech op-
posing the motion, David
Triesman explained what
student reaction should be
to major political topics. He
found sympathy on the
floor when drawing a paral-
lel between the bureaucratic
N.U.S. and their counter-
parts on University staff.
His main argument rela-
tive to the motion was that
students were in a position
to set a new code of ethics.
Since problems such as
Vietnam, race and germ
warfare were of an emo-
tional nature, negotiations
failed to express the real
feelings involved. He there-
fore urged that militant de-
monstration was the only
method of getting the
bureaucrats to act.
The seconder for the mo-
tion had little to say. but the
seconder for the opposition
quoied examples of militant
demonstrations succeding
abroad where negotiations
had failed. He mentioned
in particular the Indian at-
tainance of independence
and the French students' re-
volt.
After three short speeches
from the floor, the motion
was put to the vote. The
result was 4 votes for and
35 against with 19 absten-
tions.

As I sit here in the early morning looking over the
sleeping I.C. from my tower it is very difficult to think
of anything interesting or nasty to pronounce on. In fact,
it is very difficult to think of anything other than this
damned cold draught blowing up my left leg.
King Guy is dead ! Long live Keith Guy! This
sturdy old perennial—this is his fourth year on Council
(and the Library Committee)-has nopped un again as
Chairman of Ents. Isn't it about time someone gave him a
job and we got rid of him. If lie stays here much longer
the only thing he'll get is a pension
Is it true he got Pete Nichols elected as Chairman for
this year knowing that he would not be here, to take up
the post ? It certainly looks like it! Then comes Sir
Guy in his suit of shining armour and white horse to rescue
the situation by offering to look after things until the next
Chairman was elected—him ! Why was the vacancy not
widely published and the fact that anyone could stand!
For a long time not even his own committee knew this!
However, what's done is done and it will be with great
interest that we will watch to sec just how good Guy will
be. Last year Ents certainly were on top. The list of
groups who played here and went to have a hit record bears
witness to this. Already the name of Joe Cocker can b:
added to that list. Here lies the snag. It was rumoured
that his committee—most of whom have left were respon-
sible for this and would have done even better were it not
for Guy.
But Keith remains confident! He is talking of a
profit of £2.000 this year. He certainly wouldn't do that
if he continues as he has done over the last few weeks.
People aren't so thick (are you ?) that they will continue to
pay exorbitant prices to listen to crap groups (costing £15
a time) and stagger in the ever-increasing gloom over copu-
lating couples trying to find a decent looking bird—that
you should be so lucky !
Last year l.C. hops, sorry, informal dances, were fast
becoming famous not only throughout the other London
Colleges!" but over in the world of pop music. You've aot
something to live up to Keith and souiiiUutig you can ouitd
into one of the big " in " placesin London so go on bab\
-suck it to them !
PRESIDENT FOUND
AND LOST
Only 2\ hours after
R.C.S. gained a President
a week ago, a Mines/Guilds
plot formed to kidnap him.
Meandering his way from
Linstead to Southside at
approx 6 p.m. G.H. found
himself surrounded by
about 30 Mines and Guilds-
men. At 6.10 p.m. he
found himself in a Mines
man's flat in Hammersmith
drinking Scotch.
After a quick poach,
egg on toast he was whisked
away to his rightful place at
the Physics freshers' dinnc
He entered this at 8.45 p.r;
covered in yellow, red and
black warpaint: I alwav
thought R.C.S. colours were
mauve, black and white!
