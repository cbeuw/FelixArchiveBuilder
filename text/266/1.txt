CHEM ENG
THROWS UP
On Monday, 21st October, after their freshers' dinner
in the Union Dining Hall, Chem. Eng. ran riot in (hi bar.
Glasses and bottles were deliberately smashed, fireworks
thrown, and there was trouble in the street afterwards.
Everything started when
the gas supply to the beer
kegs at the dinner failed
and no one was able to ob-
tain any more beer there.
One of the Union barmen
went up to correct the fault,
but by this time a great
number of the first and se-
cond year engineers had de-
scended to the bar. The
rest of the evening was spent
getting horribly drunk in a
huddle in a corner of the
bar, and by about 10 p.m. a
table had been kicked over
and intense annoyance
caused to other bar users.
Fireworks were being
thrown at people and
glasses were being smashed
at random. Several bottles
were also thrown and bro-
ken, even though Steve
Moffat, one of the barmen,
warned the people con-
cerned.
Next morning the clean-
ers found blood splattered
in the toilet. About four
dozen pint pots and several
bottles littered the floor with
broken glass.
Ken Garrett, the other
barman, and Steve later said
that they. were disgusted
with what had happened.
Even though they had asked
C. & G . Union officers to
quieten down the bar, the
mob was so drunk that it
took no notice. In future, if
there is any similar trouble,
the bar is liable to be closed
immediately. The barmen,
in consultation with the
Duty officer, have a right
to do this.

To give credit to the Duty
Officers that night and to
the Guilds officials, every-
one was cleared out of the
Union immediately the bar
closed, but further trouble
occurred in the streets. Peo-
ple were seen hurling glasses
at cars in Prince Consort
Road. One fresher engineer
was seen by police after
jumping up and down on a
mini in Prince's Gardens.
Oddly enough, the police
only treated, his cut hand
.and then let him go.
50,000 MARCH
IN PEACE
The Press was wrong! 50,000 people turned out
last Sunday in a massive orderly peaceful demonstration
against the war in Vietnam. The size and order made it.
according to a middle-aged observer, "The greatest
demonstration that has occurred in Britain since the
1930's."
After the recent gross
misrepresentation in the
press, many " moderates "
stayed away expecting vio-
ence. The apprehension
of the people who went was
dispelled not long after the
start at Charing Cross
when the peaceful inten-
tions of most of the demon-
strators became apparent.
They linked arms on the
Embankment and moved
forward gazing at the mul-
titudes of banners and pla-
cards nrotesting about Viet-
nam, British and American
capitalism and society in
general—in fact about the
" system " and asDects of
the " system "' which con-
done such a war as that in
Vietnam. Many different
political factions were there
—-among the Maoists, the
Yoiflfg Communists and the
Vietnam Solidarity Cam-
paign were the IC Peace
Action Group and Young
Liberals — chanting " Vic-
tory to the NLF" and " W e
are all foreign scum."
All IC demonstrators had
three leaflets, one from the
N C C L . one from IC and
one from the organising
committee which explained
$he exact route and the tac-
tics to be used by the de-
monstrators — " Street
or whatever happened
to baby davy ?
After weeks of meticulous planning by RCS Mascot
Committee, a hand-picked team carried out a lamp raid
last Thursday week and made off with RSMU's hitherto
virgin mascot. The Davy Lamp had been left in the
Mines Union Office and it was the work of a few minutes
for R C S to pick the lock with a penknife.
Power" was the general
idea. Street Power it was.
At Trafalgar Square, a
splinter group left for the
US embassy while the main
body flooded down White-
hall. (
A t Hyde Park people as-
sembled to hear speeches
from Tariq A l i , Felix
Greene, an Irish militant,
and others; a telegram
from Vietnamese students
was read.
.A petition was handed
in at Downing Street. The
march continued via Parlia-
ment Square up Victoria
Street chanting strongly
outside all buildings which
were considered to be part
of the " system."
< Meanwhile back at IC,
the only call for help came
from a fresher at 11 p.m.—-
he had been arrested for
obstruction and had ob-
tained his own bail.

The first of a trail of
clues was duly delivered to
a Mines fresher dinner
within 24 hours. It did not
last, for they opened a can,
marked " Open only in
darkroom," in the middle
of the dinner, thus destroy-
ing an undeveloped strip of
film. Learning by their mis-
takes, they developed and
fixed a duplicate clue which
was given to them in a film
cassette, only to find when
the light was switched on
that it was a message on a
piece of cardboard. A t the
time of writing, Mines were
concentrating on stealing
Theta, the RCS mascot,
rather than following the
clues. Consequently, RCS
were threatening to release
the same clues to Guilds to
make it a race for the lamp.
Guilds mascot. Spanner,
has also disappeared from
its resting place in Ealing.
Rumours have been flying
around, but the most likely
story is that the stealing is
a cunning plot of subter-
fuge by Guilds to prevent
anyone stealing it at their
last freshers^ dinner, last
Monday.
Mr. Stephenson, the
Senior Warden, has been
excessively annoyed by
damage alleged to have
been done by Guildsmen
and Miners to the flower-
beds and ornamental urn in
Princes Gardens, during
their abortive raids on
Theta, while the RCS
freshers' dinners were being
held in Southside. Mr.
Stephenson did not exactly
see the damage being
caused and Dermott Corr
claims that the damage was
not done by I.C. students
engaged on a mascot raid.
