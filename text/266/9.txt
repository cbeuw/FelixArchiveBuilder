d U.F.O's
The iTellsoc U.F.O. group held its first meeting of the season in
the Electrical Engineering C
o
m
m
o
n R
o
o
m last Thursday night. The group
under the leadership of the President, Derek Hale, exists to take an
active part in the investigations of unidentified flying objects or
U.F.O's.
Just over a doaen people attended the meeting where there was a
discussion of general U.F.O. topics supplemented by cups of coffee.
N
e
w m
e
m
b
e
r
s were entertained by numerous interesting and amusing
stories although none offered any conclusive proof of the existence
of a U.F.O. In most cases-of sightings the evidence can be disproved
sufficiently and the minority of possible cases, although unexplained,
are still open to a great amount of doubt. Nevertheless a group
committee has been formed to m
a
k
e further plans for the future, N
e
w
m
e
m
b
e
r
s would be welcome. Generally the group arranges trips to
lectures and similar societies and occasionally to a cottage in Wales
to m
a
k
e observations. It is also hoped that s
o
m
e work will be done
analysing data using the college computer system.
I ' • DEBATES
Debates at I.C. have :"or too m
a
n
y years been centred on a small
group of people discussing rather than debating mainly political
motions. This year's President Chris Parker, back in harness after
a year in the wilderness, hopes to change this and already has
achieved s
o
m
e success. H
e has introduced two n
e
w functions this term^
one of which was the Fresher's debating Competition. H
e is very
secretive about the other, but it is k
n
o
w
n that it will be a trial
idea involving the top of the Union, talcing place on Nov. 19 th.
Tomorrow Thurs. 31st.,, there will be a debate on the motion:
This House considers the Motorist to be a Persecuted Class of the
Community." Raymond Baxter from the B.B.C. will be proposing it and
Prof, Colin Buchanan will oppose.
Tickets for Guilds - Mines Carnival go on sale on Thursday in the
Union and Southside. Price £2 double. P.P. Arnold topping the bill.
Theme: Play the game.
SPANNER
The President of C & G , Dermott Corr, is very pleased at the w
a
y
both Mines and R.C.S. have been hookwinked into believing Spanner has
been lost. As a result Spanner was at Civil Eng Fresher1
s Dinner on
Monday night and no-one attempted to molest it. H
e hopes that all
Guildsmen, w
h
o also believe that Spanner has been lost, will forgive
him, bearing in mind that the means justify the end.

T PROTEST
As reported in the main issue, the last I.C. Union meeting
passed a motion condemning Sennet for the "Wholly misrepresentative
attitude" and"grossly inflammatory nature" of its articles referring
to last Sunday's demonstration. Following this motion and the sending
of a letter to Sennet, which was not published, a group of people
submitted a draft copy of a protest to m
e
m
b
e
r
s of I.C. Exec, w
h
o
individually approved it. The protest was duplicated on the Rector's
duplicating machine and over 5?000 copies distributed to several
London Colleges including I..C.
However, after the distribution, someone had second thoughts
about the protest and the wisdom of signing it "I.C. Executive
Committee," Accordingly, x; the Exec, meeting on Monday, the matter
was discussed and it was agreed that nothing more shall be done.
