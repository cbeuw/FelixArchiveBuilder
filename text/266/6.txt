ft FELIX 30 October 19fi«
Due to overwhelming demand from I.C stuxtents, FELIX
introduces Aunt Vera to deal with your personal problems.
Dear Felix,
I am a first year Civil Engineer and am very worried.
Last Saturday at a hop, I managed to meet a girl from a
local teacher training college. The same night I invited her
back to my Southside Room for coffee.
I was amazed to see her remove her shoes and lie on
my bed. What should T have done? I didn't want to
appear too fast cr too slow. Having had little experience
in these matters, I thought F E L I X could help me.
Yours, Anxious.
Your problem is a common one, but as I do not know
what happened next, it is very difficult to give a simple
answer. Was she tired after her exertions0
Did you
notice if she had drunk a lot? If not, you failed to observe
the first rule of male decency, that of providing for your
guest. Beware of it next time.
A U N T V E R A
Dear Felix,
Before I came to I.C., I was overcome with apprehen-
sion that the girls here might be of the iypically " scientific
breed." But in my department there is a girl who is
becoming the most important thing in my life.
Despite my feelings, I don't want to deprive the boys
of her company. Please, can you help me?

P.S. I c?.n't keep it to myself much longer—Lesley.
Dear Le iey,
I hr 'en't really get the space here to advise you fully
but con»B up and see me some time. In the meantime
though, con't worry about depriving the boys (they can
look after themselves) and :
.f any serious problems emerge,
rjay a visit tc '.4, Princes Gardens.

Charity Carnival:
Coordinator Speaks
Last Thursday week the Union chose its charity for
this year's Carnival—The National Council for the Un-
married Mother and Child—and in so doing set itself the
greatest challenge in the history of I.C. Carnivals. We, as
members of that Union, have taken on virtually sole re-
sponsibility for the solvency of this tremendously worth-
while organisation.
The amount they need to
continue their work is
£12,000. Last year's carni-
val proceeds were just short
of £5,000, so it is obvious
that a great deal more effort
is going to be needed for us
to reach our target. On t
c her band, this target is by
no means impossible. Last
ir, Mech Eng I collected
00 on foeir own. A
effort from 20 such
?ow and we. have our
'ready.
. *.hen is the heart of
rtter. The carnival—

-rg *o the number of
:-epared to help and
. amount of effort they
* ."r'c ft. In administra-
rJ", ? ?.rt a host of jobs
be e'eje, frcm organising
events to sticking labels on
tins, counting money, and so
on, and the committee will
be more than grateful to
anyone who is prepared to
sacrifice just a few evenings
during the year to help in
this.

Ian Jarvis
The first Carnival event
this year which carries on
until next Easter is collect-
ing.
This is, of course, the
main money-raiser, and is
an event in which everyone
can take part. There is no
second-year so over-work-
ed, no P.G. so absorbed in
his project and certainly no
first-year so involved in
anything that he can't afford
to spend an evening or two
going from pub to pub, un-
derground to underground,
street to street, restaurant to
restaurant, rattling the tin.
The Vice-Presidents will
shortly be contacting their
constituent colleges for the
preliminary outings where
hundreds of Miners, Scien-
tists, or Engineers descend
on the unprepared public of
the great city, and after this
year reps, take over to add
competition between years
to that between Colleges.
H e l p
Wanted
You will be given plenty
of notice of subsequent
events which are planned al-
ready, while any ideas that
individuals, groups of stu-
dents or societies may
have for fund-raising activi-
ties will be more than wel-
come. The target we have
set ourselves is a high one,
but with a little effort from
everyone in the college, it's
one which we can easily
pass.
Would anyone prepared
to help Carnival in any way
please contact either their
vice-president or Ian Jarvis,
the carnival co-ordinator,
through the union letter-
rack.
