UNION M E E T I N G S

COMMEM DAY
Commemoration Day happened as usual. About 700
people walked across the stage, much to the delight of
their parents and the boredom of themselves.
Seven eminent scientists were admitted to the fellow-
ship of the college, their previous achievements and adven-
tures being ably and wittily outlined by the Staff Orator,
Prof. Francis.
The first I C U meeting of
the session was held on
Thursday. Oct 17th. It
started on time (!) with over
500 people present (!!).
Dave Wield read out a
letter to be sent to the De-
partment of Education and
Science expressing the dis-
approval of the Union on
the Government's attitude
to students' grants. Copies
of the letter will be distribu-
ted to year reps for everyone
to sign.
A letter from the Rector
was read explaining the rise
in the Union fees. The
Union is now in a position
to repay, within two years, a
loan from the college.
E l e c t i o n s
The election for the va-
cancy of floor rep on Coun-
cil was next, John Hunt be-
ing proposed by Gwyn
Hughes and Chris Parker
by Dermott Corr. After
the usual proposal speeches
about communication with
disinterested Union mem-
bers, John Hunt was elected
by 234 votes to 205, with
62 abstentions.
Then followed the election
of four members of the Wel-
fare Committee, Chris Kent,
Pete Woods, Mary Ford
and Teresa Smart and two
members of the External
Affairs Committee, Robin
Cibiee and Dave Cooper, all
unopposed. Dave Cooper
and Les Ebdon were elected,
again unopposed, to serve
on the Constitutional Re-
form Committee.
C h a r i t y
The election of the Carni-
val Charity followed. Tom
Marples proposing Unmar-
ried Mothers made probably
the most moving speech and
stressed the need for a mere
£12.000 to save the collapse
of the organization. As is
now generally known " The
National Council for the
Unmarried Mother and her
Child " was finally chosen as
this year's charity by about
100 votes.
Question time produced
an enquiry by Dave Cooper
on the reduction in size of
the milk cartons sold in the
machines around the Col-
lege. This is apparently due
to the " General Policy " of
Express Dairies, but the
matter was being investi-
gated.
The motion on proposed
standing orders for U.G.M's.
was postponed until the next
Union Meeting (28th Nov.)
to give the union members
time to read them. Copies
can be obtained from the
Union office.
S e n n e t
Condemned
Among any other busi-
ness Lilas Campion gave the
telephone number to be
used by arrested I.C. stu-
dents at Sunday's Anti-
Vietnam demonstrations.
Andy McGregor invited
someone to propose a mo-
tion condemning Rennet, the
U.L.U. newspaper for its
inflammatory front page in
the issue of the 16th Octo-
ber. Piers Corbyn and Nick
Holmes finally proposed
that I.C.U. condemns Sen-
net for wholly misrepre-
senting the attitude of both
students and police at the
forthcoming demonstration
and for printing an article of
a grossly inflammatory na-
ture. A n amendment that
a letter be sent to the Editor
conveying our opinion was
carried and the final motion
was carried almost unani-
mously.
Mr. Boothman got up to
propose an " emergency
motion " to the effect that
we send our sympathies to
the Associated Electrical
and Foundry Workers Union
in their struggle to win a
living wage. The conser-
vative Union voted that the
motion not even be put to
tiie house.
Dramsoc provided ma-
chine-gunning effects at
suitable moments, and an
extremely disrespectful play-
ing of the Queen to finish
the meeting.
The main event at the Tuesday 22nd R.C.S. Union
meeting was the announcing of the official result of the
Presidential Ballot held the previous day. Gwyn Hughes
of Maths 3 triumphed over Peter Dolwin with a landslide
victory by 339 votes to 173, with 96 abstentions
tradition demands
As
Gwyn stripped to a pair of
shorts and made three cir-
cuits of the lecture theatre
bearing the R.C.S. mascot
Theta above his head. He
recited the Kangela back-
wards and took a long
draught of an odious liquid,
dutifully prepared by the
Secretary. The meeting
moved outdoors and the
Queen of Jez, Wendy Leigh
with several eager helpers,
proceeded to daub every
available inch of Gwyn's
skin with paint in the R.C.S.
colours. The final initiation
ceremony was then carried
out by ex-president Jeff
Warren. who anointed
Gwyn with the remainder of
his " drink."
Gwyn then led the mob in
a Kangela even though drip-
ping with paint, milk, beer,
and whatever else Chris
Yewlett had seen fit to mix
into the brew.
Among the more formal
Union business Martin
Bland proposed that, in
future, presidential elections
should be held during the
Easter term of the College
year, to enable candidates to
campaign without the pres-
sures of approaching exami-
nations, and thus R.C.S.
would not be in the distres-
sing position of being with-
out a president for long
periods at a time. This was
unopposed and carried. Pho-
tographs of " Davy " which
had been stolen as reported
elsewhere in F E L I X were
circulated in the audience—
just to give them a thrill.
Lastly, M r . Jeff Warren,
former acting president, was
C . & G . U .
For Guilds Union meet-
ing on Tuesday the 22nd, an
almost full M.E.220 was re-
corded, if Guilds bother to
record these things at all.
Dave Cox is already show-
ing remarkable efficiency
and ;speed in reading the
minutes and no doubt will
soon have them down to
one flat.
A letter was read to the
Union from the Senior
Warden expressing his dis-
may in the remarkable im-
provement in the Fresher's
dinners this year, or perhaps
it was the increase in rowdy-
knighted by Adolf with the
aid of a large, paint-smeared
model of "Spanner," and
the mob broke up. leaving
Gwyn chanting a lone
Kangela.

ple are heloing — finishing
touches will be put on

h»'- -was we may have
missed come along—map

Militancy
The Rector, in his own
inimitable way, attacked
the activities of militant
students at other colleges
and summarised the pro-
gress of the previous year,
paying particular attention
to the improvements in
staff-student relations at
this college and the increase
in residential accommoda-
tion. He also reported on
the proposed union with
the Architectural Associa-
tion and the emergence of
an Imperial College Medi-
cal School.
The Special Visitor, Sir
Denning Pearson. Deputy
Chairman of Rolls-Royce,
delivered an address out-
lining recent and possible
future changes in British
industry, particularly with
regard to co-operation with
the universities. He em-
phasised the importance to
the survival of Britain as a
nation of increasing the
flow of talent into industry
in order to enable us to
compete effectively in world
markets.
Our Union Secretary,
not-so-plain Jane Perason,
performed the task of Stu-
dent Orator with a cool and
calmly confident air. It
must be noted that a cer-
tain member of the Execu-
tive appeared to be suffer-
ing from the effects of his
21st birthday during the
ceremony.
Pleasure?
Were it not for the plea-
sure afforded to parents, it
could be argued that the
whole farcical and highly
expensive procedure could
be safely forgotten. How-
ever, I'm sure that even
they would agree that the
whole charade could be
easily speeded up without
losing any of its essential
features.
ism that was mentioned, I
forget.
Morphy Day
Morphy Day was adver-
tised by Frank Coldwell,
and that happens to be to-
day so don't forget to go
and throw flour or some-
thing at Dermott, all you
Guildsmen. The Brighton
run on Nov. 3rd was also
mentioned, something about
a pyjama party (early morn-
ing) in Hyde Park, I think.
The special branch of R.C.S. Motor Club, training for Sunday's riots was visited
by some officer of the Metropolitan Police already trained to our way of J ^ S "
JezwSnoi only used for joy-riding, but was commandeered by the sergeant to carry his
squad to strategic positions in l.C.
Bos Bird
The election of Bo-Belle,
a bin' to go in Boanerges,
was carried out with Corr
having proposed to the
glamorous girls in Guilds.
A very mysterious girl,
Paulie, vaguely disguised as
Guilds Ents. Officer, was
elected but the official Belle
was announced later as Jane
Ashton of Mech. Eng. I.
Paulie's deposing is believed
to be due to her inability to
sing in a low enough voice
while stripteasing to the
goggle-eyed guildsmen.
Paul Shelton (heavily dis-
guised as Paulie) then an-
nounced the " Play the
game " GUILDSmines Car-
nival, 40s. double, with pos-
sibilities of him having P.
P. Arnold on Nov. 15.
Two films, which could
have been described as rol-
licking, of Bo and various
custard-pie fights and er . . .
Bo, were shown amidst im-
provised sound effects and
cries of, " Where's Span-
ner?" ( + £%$&?)
The lights on again re-
vealed spanner shrunk to a
size which Dermott could
actually lift, but it soon
lengthened on suitable
switching. Finally he held
it up and cried out "Booma-
laka!"
