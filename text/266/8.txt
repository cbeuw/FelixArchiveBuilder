_FELIX 30 October 1968

With everyone suffering from post-Olympic mental
indigestion, readers will be forgiven if they give the sports
page a miss this week. However, although they weren't
among the medals, we must congratulate Messrs. Bayles,
Malpass, Cooper (Rowing), and Graham Paul (Fencing)
for their efforts in Mexico.
On the Rugby front, we must extend our sympathies
to Mines Tankards (3rd XV) who in the mis-match of the
year were beaten 100-0 by U.L. 1st X V at Hotspur Park
last week, despite some remarkable new tactical plays by
the losers. On Sunday, the 1st X V play the Belgium
National X V at Harlington, K.O. 11 a.m. Coaches
9.30 a.m.. Union Arch.
On a more victorious note it was good to see the 1st
X V win so convincingly against such arch rivals as U.C.
I gather than the trend, hasn't been entirely maintained,
but I am sure we can hope for some more good results
this season.
SOLID START
BY ROWERS
The Boat Club has made
a very promising start to
the year's training and a
significant increase in mem-
bership has been achieved
with the aid of a lively re-
cruiting campaign extending
well beyond the first week
of term. New members have
been joining steadily each
week and an outing on the
river in some form of boat
is guaranteed even if it is
one's first time "down."
Morphy Day this year,
apart from the usual sport
on the towpath, should pro.
vide an interesting after-
noon's entertainment as the
constituent college crews ap-
pear to be of a fairly even
standard though the inevi-
table secrecy prevents an ac-
curate assessment. Races
take pjace at 3.00 and 3.30
for the Lowry and Morphy
Cups respectively but most
" spectators" arrive well
before these times.
On Saturday 19th October
five crews represented the
College in the Four's Head
of the River race which was
the first of a full programme
of regattas and Head races
during the year. The race
was rowed in the normal
processional fashion, each
crew starting 10 seconds be-
hind the previous one.
Out of 124 entries the 1st
IV finished 18th; 2nd IV—
72nd; 3rd IV—60th; 4th IV
73rd; and 5th IV 104th.

We have had many en-
quiries from beginners
about the Club, but unfortu-
nately the number of ex-
perienced fencers is less than
we had envisaged. The Club
has no formal trials for the
first team selection, but re-
lies on the Captain's ability
to select the team by assess-
ing a fencer's performance
during sessions. Professor
Akos Moldevanye provides
first class coaching for two
hourly periods a week. De-
tails of the times of club
meetings can be found on
the club notice board, which
is situated near the Union
cloakroom.
The fixture list for the
year includes the entry of
teams consisting each of a
foilist, an epeeist, and a sab-
rent, for the Goddin Cup
(a London University inter-
collegiate trophy) which we
have held for the last three
years. Two teams, one a
ladies' team, are being en-
tered for the London
League, which is a compe-
tition open to all London-
based fencing clubs. Since
this latter competition is run
on similar lines to the F.A.
League, it entails a large
number of matches. Any
gaps in the fixture list are
readily filled with matches
with non-London clubs.
Every endeavour is made to
picvide competitive fencing
for fencers of all levels of
experience.
GREAT
I.C. WIN
I.C. won the first league
match of the season in as
convincing a manner as the
scoreline suggests. The I.C.
team, including no less than
seven freshers to the college,
played fast open football
and thoroughly deserved
this victory.
Playing with the wind
and the sun, the I.C. at-
tack put pressure on the
U.C. defence in the opening
stages of the game and after
some near misses Tom Mc-
Cardle put I.C. ahead, with a
fine angled shot. I.C. con-
tinued to dominate the game
and used the one-two move
to great effect. It was this
move which put Bob Hor-
lock thrdugh the defence to
score the second goal.
Although U.C. tried to
break out of defence they
were easily contained by the
LC. back line ?uid the mid-
field players took control.
Shortly before half-time I.C.
scored again when Dave
King hit a superb swerving
shot which the goalkeeper
could only help into the pet.
After half-time I.C. ex-
pected a determined effort
by U.C., who now had the
advantage of wind and sun
but it was in fact I.C. who
continued to exert pressure
and soon Tony Richards put
I.C. further ahead. After
this I.C. were in complete
command and Bob Horlock
and Roger Dixon, who wan-
dered intelligently from his
normal role in the back line,
added further goals. U.C.
scored a rather fortunate
goal in the closing stages
but by this time I.C. were
convincing winners.
This was a splendid win
by the I.C. XI and, although
the defence has yet to be
seen under pressure, there
are great hopes for the com-
ing season,

1 s t . XV MEET
THE BIG BOYS
The 1st X V can count
themselves unluckv to have
been beaten by this margin
by a competent Rosslyn
Park XV. Like I.C., Ross-
lyn Park has been having
no little trouble with their
1st X V and had dropped 7
of that team, most of whom
appeared against I.C. on
Saturday.
Pine opened the scoring
with a penalty from the
Park's 10 yds line but there
was a quick reoly with
another penalty. The Park
steadily built up the pres-
sure on I.C. and before
half-time had scored ' a
dropped goal and two tries
—one from a very good
three-quarter movement,
one rather dubious. How-
ever I.C. can really only
blame their own slack tack-
ling for being 14-3 down at
this stage.
The second half was
much better for the fitter
I.C. team, and a beautiful
beautiful I.C. try was
rounded off by Heaton after
some thrilling passing. 14-6
was to be the final score.;
I.C. all but scored twice
more. Very near the end,
the Park's kicker justly
missed a penalty under
I.C.'s posts.

During this term and
next I.C. cricket club
will be making weekly visits
to Alf Gover's indoor school
and any person who would
like to play cricket during
the Summer Term is en-
couraged to come along.
The nets are at the moment
booked from 12—1 p.m.
on Stjnday but if this proves
to be an impossible time
for some, then other more
suitable times can be ar-
ranged.
Throughout the summer
term the cricket club runs
three regular Wednesday
and Saturday teams and
one side on Sundays. We
pride ourselves on a strong
and varied fixture list with
matches against both U.L.
Colleges and club sides in
and around London.
In 1966 and 1967 seasons
we finished runners-up in
the U.L. knock-out cup and
in this coming season We
will be making a very deter-
mined «effort to at last win
the competition.
One of the highlights on
the season comes at the end
of the summer term when
the cricket club goes on its
annual tour of Devon. It is
always an enjoyable time
and is an institution which
certainly no cricketer should
miss.
HOCKEY
NEWS
There was a healthy in-
flux of new fife into the club
at the beginning of the year/
and at the trials the overall
standard was higher than in
other years.
Bad weather delayed the
start of the season, so it was
only on Wednesday 16th
that the 1st XI played their
opening game against Guy's
Hospital. The game began
at a cracking pace with both
sets of forwards hitting the
ball hard and fast. Guys
opened the scoring in the
first half with a shot from
close range from a pass off
the goal line. I.C. replied
soon afterwards through
Mike Pratt after a good run.
This was to remain the score
for the rest of the game.
The pace slackened con-
siderably in the second half
due to lack offitnesson both
sides.
M I X E D
F O R T U N E S
On Saturday 19th the col-
lege fielded 4 XI's against
West Essex. The 1st XI lost
2—1 after leading at half
time through another good
goal from Pratt. The high-
fight of the afternoon was
the !6—0 win by the 4th
team who were playing with
only 10 men. The seconds
did well to draw 1—1, and
the 3rds lost 1—0.
The main disappointment
this, season has not been the
play but the attitude of
some players. It was hoped
to have bad 5 teams this
season, and in lact fixtures
for the 5th had been ar-
ranged, but people being
unavailable has made it im-
possible to run this team so
far.

I.C. Freshers did ex-
tremely well in the U.L.S.C.
Team Trials on 19th—20th
October. Out of the best 8
freshers, 6 were from I.C.
Three of these did excel-
lently against the old lags on
the Sunday, Peter Claydon
got twofirsts,Nicholas Mar-
tin a first , and Par Tiere
two seconds.
Conditons were moderate,
and ideal for trials. How-
ever the Autumn Trophy on
the previous weekend was
somewhat blustery, and both
the Commodore and Vice-
Commodore were seen to
enter the water rather igno-
miniously.
