FBI IX JO October 1968
At sr..: time of writing. J do inn know the outcome ...
.i *. i .y'f Vietnam domonstration. I do not know
it beihv there were riots, wholesale arrests or outbreaks of
ttfldah- although 1 suspect this was the case. 1 am
uKU" concerned .at the moment with similar happenings in
the Union after the Chem Eng Freshers' Dinner on the
2lit. As reported elsewhere in FELIX, some irresponsible
member* of Chem Eng spent their time smashing glasses
and botttas and hurling fireworks in the Union Bar, while a
few romped off the evening by throwing glasses in the
Prince Consort Road. This sort of behaviour should not be
tolerated from anyone, let alone from the supposed cream
of the country's youth. Not only are smashed beer mugs
expensive to replace, but a carpet of broken glass is
dangerous especially if someone in his drunkencss should
slip and fall on it. Even more dangerous is the lighting of
fireworks in a crowded bar and, on the night in question,
fireworks were not merely lit but deliberately thrown at
people. I need not comment on the incident in Prince
Consort Road; the sheer hooliganism of the act speaks
for itself. It is expected by now that there be singing and
chants and heavy drinking in the bar after Freshers' Din-
ners, but not irresponsible vandalism of the sort that occur-
red the other Monday. That night the limit was reached—
let it not be reach-d again.
From irresponsibility to unintcrest. Mr. Mooney, the
guy in charge of refectories at the College, seems to be
completely apathetic toward the idea of the Southside
coffee bar. Despite valiant efforts to liven the place up last
week with canned music, it has been bedevilled by poor
organisation on the part of the catering staff. Firstly the
refreshment offered is extremely limited. No-one seems to
have heard of milk-shakes or anything apart inm coffee
and Pepsi. The range of foodstuffs is limited to lukewarm
pies and rock-hard sausage rolls. Secondly, on several
..ight: recently even the small range of food and drink has
been reduced to coffee and tea and the coffee machine
had broken down and was not repaired for three days.
On the subject of the coffee bar, I believe there is no
provision for similar facilities in the new college block.
Why not kill two birds with one stone and turn the
inefficient and understood Southside shop into a decent
coffee inn with music and an intimate atmosphere.
And from food to fire. Isn't it about time we had a
few fire drills around College? Apart from brightening up
our hardworking academic lives they are quite useful from
the safety point of view. A case that springs to mind is
South side—a real death-trap if a major fire occurred!
I notice that Unstead Hall has already educated its in-
habitants in escape procedure and I think the Southside
Halls should follow their younger brother's example. After
the minor fire last year when one room in Southside was
burnt out while people hung out of the windows to cheer
thefire-enginesas they arrived to deal with the case, some-
one should be thinking of the effect of fire sweeping up
a whole staircase. Maybe someone's got to die first!

Ents Reply To Criticism Mascot Mania
Sir.
The members of Inst
vear's committee were very
interested to learn how little
they did and how much Mr.
Nicholls did. Mr. Fair-
clough's article suggests
that his knowledge of I.C.
Ents is second only to his
ability to present unbiased
opinions.
Point 1. At the end of
the first term last year the
Ents Committee had a sur-
plus of £400 and not debts
of £500.
Point 2. Mr. Nicholls
was not responsible for any
" revolution " in the ideas
behind college entertain-
ments. Mr. Sage was re-
sponsible for booking
nearly all the groups last
year: Messrs. Ashcroft and
Parkinson were responsible
for the excellent publicity.
Mr. Guy was responsible
for overall co-ordination
and hence taking the "risks"
involved
Point 3. The only dance
that Mr. Nicholls took any
more part in than any other
Ents " worker" was the
Carnival dance, which was
far from the success that
the article suggests.
As for this year's com-
mittee, and in particular,
Keith Guy, disbanding
" ideas formulated and
agreed on last year"; we
only say that this is non-
sense since no new ideas
were agreed. The Friday
night concerts were dis-
cussed and Mr. Nicholls
was to book artistes for
these. He was also to book
artistes for this year's in-
formal dances. He did
neither!
As for the rest of the
article one can only say that
Mr. Fairclough is entitled
to his opinions but that we
feel that they are unlikely
to be the opinions of the
new committee.
We remain,
Your obedient servants,
N. Cowin, Keith Guy,
P. Ashcroft, N. C. Clark,
Gordon Sage,
K. Parkinson, S. England.
Sir,
I am writing in the wake
of a mascot mania, which
has brought up the whole
question of inter-collegiate
rivalry. Why should RCS
have "removed" the Miners'
precious Davy lamp? Why
should the Miners seek re-
venge by attempting to rid
RCS of their invaluable
Theta? Mascots are surely
intended as a symbol of the
pride you should take in
your constituent college.
Does it really prove anything
if someone breaks down a
door and walks off with a
symbol? If you think it does
why not join the Wooden
Horse Club and squeeze
blood out of other colleges;
after all they've given us
quite a run around with our
impregnable " Mike."
Don't get me wrong
though. Rivalry and compe-
tition between Guilds, Mines
and RCS is a very good
thing, but can't we restrict
it to Morphy Day and
sports events.

Student House Facts
Sir,
We feel that certain mis-
leading information about
Mining House was published
in Mr. Ebdon's article
" They Tell Me " in the last
issue of FELIX. The facts
are as follows:
There are nine toilets and
seven baths for 60 resi-
dents. 17 residents have
hand-basins in their own
rooms, the rest share seven
basins. Whilst there is a
shortage of handbasins,
especially at the bottom of
the house, it is hoped to in-
stall extra units in future.
The toilet and bath facilities
in the house are adequate
and residents have experi-
enced little or no inconveni-
ence on this score.
It is unrealistic to assume
that a new venture such as
the opening of Student
Houses should be unaccom-
panied by teething troubles
and most of these are of a
minor nature which most
residents are accepting
cheerfully. The concensus
of informed opinion within
the House is that accommo-
dation compares reasonably
well with the Halls. The
decorating of the staircases
will be finished this week,
washing and drying equip-
ment will soon be installed
and plans for improving the
cooking facilities are under
consideration.
There are about five va-
cancies in Mining House
which are being kept for the
residents of 40-44 Evelyn
Gardens who are finding
difficulty with their present
accommodation. Anyone
in this position should get
in touch with the warden at
55 Evelyn Gardens.
As Mr. Ebdon says,
something must be done to
attract students to Student
Houses. What better than
an informed article in FE-
LIX giving an accurate
overall picture, not just the
difficulties?
Incidentally, Miss Jane
Pearson is Secretary of IC
Union.

Squash Courts and Staff
Sir,
I would like to express
my deep regret at the recent
decision to exclude all staff
from the squash courts.
During the last academic
year certain issues e.g. park-
ing, refectories and use of
the swimming pool were
thrashed out on the basis of
communal use by all mem-
bers of the College. My
feelings have always been
that Imperial College is not
just academic staff or under-
graduates but a small com-
munity in which we all have
a part to play. In addition,
the College has built up
excellent staff-student re-
lations and consequently
this sudden exclusion of
staff from the squash courts
which has happened since
the long vacation could have
unfortunate repercussions,
e.g. how many students use
the Holland Club at lunch-
times?
Quite a few members of
staff have expressed their
regret at this decision and I
am sure that most members
of the College would appre-
ciate a clarification of the
motives behind it.

Press
Misconceptions
Sir,
At the last Union meeting
we passed a motion con-
demning Sennet for mis-
representation. Somebody
stated that as Sennet was
basically conveying fact ra-
ther than opinion our mo-
tion was not to be supported.
People who read the articles
in Sennet would agree that
th.:> were largely factual,
but the point was surely the
heading—it implied that
there was almost an urban
guerilla war being prepared
—this is extremely mislead-
ing, and therefore must be
condemned.
Such headings tend to en-
courage violence because :
(a) people go there expect-
ing it
(b) people who do not want
it stay away.
The neo-nationalist-mono-
poiy press abo misrepresent,
in a similar manner, and be-
cause they often report
O N L Y the violence they
create more violence (de-
monstrations want publi-
city). Students are begin-
ning to realise more fully the
general press misrepresen-
tations—especially after the
Evening News event.
If the general deceit of
the press continues, student
militancy will become more
directed against the press, as
it is in Germany, and then
maybe Sennet's headlines
will be accurate.

Fascists
Sir,
A new low in literacy has
been reached in a broad-
sheet placed on the South-
side noticeboards by the IC
Conservative Soc. In it we
hear of a strange political
group called "Fascists" and
we are also told that the
Society will persuade lis of
their point of view by " sub-
tile " means. As for the
latter, I at first though that
the luminaries of the Con-
servative Society simply did
not know how to spell, but
on consulting Fowler I
found that I was mistaken.
He states, writing around
1920, that "Spellings with
the ' i ' retained are usually
left to archaists of various
kinds."
What an unfortunately
apt characterisation of the
IC Conservative Society.
