ENTS
Sir,
As m
e
m
b
e
r
s of the present I.C. Ents Committee libelled in your issue of l 6 t h inst,
by one M.M. Fairclough, w
e wish to phase on record that regrettable as the failure of
Pete Nicholls is, this was due to total neglect of academic work and not to his
seemingly magnificent master minding of Ents as reported by Mr. Pairclough. In actual*..,,-....
fact, valuable as his contribution was, after his appointmentj which was only in
February, it formed by no stretch of the imagination the bulk of Ents work, which is
performed "
b
y the entire committee, and is very often a thankless task.
In addition w
e wish to endorse the election of Keith Guy as chairman and the
position of Peter Ashcroft as treasurer. Mr, Fairclough knowledge of the internal
affairs of Ents, both this year and last, is totally lacking and w
e respectfully
suggest the printing of only accredited facts in articles such as this in futures"
W
e remain Sir, your obedient servants,
Neville R. Cowin

R T.V.
The colour T.V. for the Union will arrive next Wednesday. The delay is because
a new-anti-theft frame has had to be m
a
d
e for it and the Union has to insure it.
Radio Rentals have evidently given up insuring their T.V. sets. W
h
o can blame them,

R LETTER '.\ '
.
Sometime lai>t Y/eek, or the w
e
e
k before, I v/ent to m
y first and almost certainly
m
y last I.C. debate. It was the "Freshers Debate",
Today or Yesterday or the day before that I read the report of the Freshers
Debate" and v/as unable to believe what I saw. This glowing journalism talked wildy
pf what fun and h
o
w everybody-enjoyed themselves^ and....
You see I can say it was the most incredible act of m
o
n debate I have ever
witnessed Banal, Trite, stupid. I can rememberonly one of the speakers names and
that was Rex Lowin or Lewin or something and he is, I a
m quite convinced, possessed
of a mental age of sixteen. H
e spoke or rather droned for what seemed hours and said
nothing.
- To.crown it all, it v/as inevitably in aid of a barrel or tankard or potty full
of beer. This fetish over drinking and the associations of manhood (eg muscles,
beard, masturbation etc) seems to weigh on every event that takes place at I.p. and
is a phenomenon peculiar to it. The implication is, because there am1
1 enough
w
o
m
e
n and because if you don't your impotence is assured you must drink and also must
be seen to drink preferably in excess.
Here again this ceremonial worship of the m
u
n
d
a
n
e suceeded.
