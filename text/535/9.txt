REVIEW
THE EAGLES
THE LONG RUN'
(SINGLE REVIEW)
The second release from the album of the
same name, this is a record that I actually like
(it's a good thing that I'm not reveiwing the
new Floyd single, despite being a Floyd fan).
It makes an excellent follow-up to 'Heartache
Tonight', a recent chart success for the band.
Like 'Heartache' it has a strong beat, but isn't
quite so raunchy, being more in the
traditional Eagles style, although the
influence of J o e Walsh is present and
certainly prevents the music being in a rut.
The lyrics are written by D o n Henley and
Glen Frey, and surprisingly for the Eagles,
give an optimistic message of hope when in
difficulties; they are sung with feeling by Don
Henley. J o e Walsh directly contributes some
excellent work on slide guitar, there is also a
pleasing backing of Don Felder on organ. The
new drummer, Tim Schmidt formerly with
Poco, provides a rock steady beat with
interesting and imaginative variations in
exact rhythm. In all this is an excellent
production by Bill Szymczyk (what a name!)
who has very closely followed Glynn John's
production style of this masterful West Coast
band.
This is a good choice of single for pre-
Christmas release, and if you don't already
own the album, would make a reasonable
addition to your record collection.
