Dear Editor
In your report, FELIX 16th
November 1979, of our recent
staff/student committee meeting
you quoted me as saying that I
had "ordered a complete freeze
on all expenditure, in the hope of
bringing the true nature of the
situation home to the College
authorities". What I actually said
was "....home to the C C D staff, its
s t u d e n t s a n d the C o l l e g e
authorities".
In parallel with our call for
administrative action to change
our classicifcation and grants to
reflect the true nature of our
u n d e r g r a d u a t e c o u r s e , the
department must launch a serious
effort to plan expenditure and
eliminate waste. Apart from the
fact that there is, at present, no
money to spend in the kitty,
achievement of the necessary
degree of economy requires the
active awareness and collabora-
tion of the entire C C D staff. It was
hoped that a freeze would help to
achieve this - indeed it has: Since
the freeze would inevitably affect
students it needed to be brought
to their attention, hence my
statement to the staff/student
committee.
Yours sincerely

Dear Disgusted
We have d i s c u s s e d y o u r
problem at great length and have
decided that you may need to
seek counselling advice.
Your problem is not uncommon
at IC. It begins with your
arithmetic inaccuracy. Only 85%
of the College are unable to
become pregnant and a lesser
p e r c e n t a g e t h a n t h a t are
incapable of taking any part in the
p r o c e s s w h a t s o e v e r (these
figures are not at hand).
Y o u r s e c o n d p r o b l e m is
extreme self-centredness leading
to paranoid exclusion of all
problems except those directly
affecting yourself. In time, you
could expect to be able to accept
that other people can concern
t h e m s e l v e s w i t h i s s u e s of
importance to various minority
sections without excluding the
problems of the majority. (In fact,
majorities are made up of
minorities - often including
individuals!).
Your final problem is a desire to
be unpleasant to individuals or
groups of individuals that you do
not personally know, nor have any
reason to bear a grudge against.
Most often this feeling results
from an inability to understand or
come to terms with concepts that
threaten your own dogmatic
i d e a s . T h i s leads to y o u r
exclusion and hatred of people
presenting these differing views.
You would be better to deal with
t h e s e p r o b l e m s by o p e n
discussion with other people.
You may need-further advice in
order to be able to play a
constructive role in society in the
future. We can suggest various
addresses (if you could send a
plain brown paper envelope to the
FELIX Office), oryou could attend
a counselling session in Huxley
Building Room 640 today (Friday)
at 2:30pm.
Yours helpfufly,
Anna and Marge (Ms' Raeburn
and Proops).
Dear ICU
At the last Union meeting over
three quarters of an hour was
spent discussing a motion against
the Corrie Bill. Before a vote was
taken on the motion the quorum
was successfully challenged (the
count was 294, six people short of
the required 300). The feeling at
the meeting, I would guage, would
have passed the motion (but we
won't speculate on the reasons
why quorum was called) and I feel
that most people understood the
question, so to repeat the whole
debate would only restrict the
amount of time available to
discuss other topics. In this letter I
will therefore outline the case
presented at the last U G M and
suggest a move to the vote at the
next U G M on Tuesday.
The motion notes the clauses in
the Corrie bill, believes that the
bill will cut the number of legally
available abortions by 2/3rds, the
bill constitutes a direct attack on
abortion rights and a woman's
right to choose; the bill will mean a
return to backstreet abortions. It
resolves to support future actions
against the Corrie Bill, affiliation
to the campaign against Corrie
and organise a collection for
donations to Campaign against
Corrie.
The bill reduces the upper time
limit for abortions from 28 weeks
to 20 weeks. This will only effect
1% of women seeking abortions.
At present less than 1% of
abortions take place after 20
weeks . These are the most
desperate cases - school girls
(who hope if they don't say
anything their periods will come
and they won't be pregnant), older
women (who mistake pregnancy
symptoms for the menopause),
women who after having tests find
the child they are carrying has a
high chance of physical or mental
handicap, if it is found that there is
a high risk of woman dying in
childbirth.
Anti-abortionists always give
the option of adoption - but
besides the fact that women are
not breeding machines, it must be
noted that only white perfect
babies are wanted - there are over
250,000 children in care.
The bill will completely smash
the charities who in performing
abortions at cost (ie even though
their turnover may be Â£1 million,
this is used to pay staff,
provisions, maintenance etc.,
they (BPAS, PAS) are registered
charities). In some areas eg
Birmingham, the N H S perform
less than 15% of abortions in
those areas - the charities perform
a vital function in these areas.
The consciousness clause will
now mean that any person not
wishing to have anything to do
with abortions can refuse without
either giving any warning nor any
reason. Obviously no one wants
unsympathetic people involved in
the performing of abortions or
after care but unsympathetic
doctors who will simply refuse a
woman, without referring her
elsewhere, are certainly not
helping her in any way and only
causing more hardshipand strain.
The British Medical Association is
against the Corrie Bill.
I therefore urge you to consider
these arguments, remembering
that a woman must be able to
control her body. Turn up to the
Union Meeting.

Dear People
In discussions on abortion, the
most often quoted rights are: that
of the unborn child to life, and the
right of the woman to determine
what happens to her body. The
second of these is in no way
fundamental, as compared to the
first, which is, and therefore,
cannot be used in opposition to
the same. I will explain the
reasoning behind this assertion.
The so-called right of the
woman over her body is, in this
case, merely an expression ofthe
Right of Might, for the woman in
question simply argues thus:
" S i n c e t h i s p r e g n a n c y is
inconvenient to me, and since I
have the capability, whether by
legal or illegal means to terminate
this pregnancy, since I have the
might, then I also have the rightto
terminate this pregnancy."
Those who would argue thatthe
woman's 'right' must prevail over
the right of her unborn child to
life, must realise thattheiropinion
is simply another expression of
the right of might, since the other
partly concerned (the unborn
child) is in no position to give an
opinion, (and consequently no
right to one!).
If 50% or more of abortion
operations resulted in the death of
the mother, could one still speak
of the right of "a woman to
abortion. In other words, if the
'might' element were removed,
would the 'right' still obtain? I
think not, can we considerthen, a
right that holds only under certain
c o n d i t i o n s as b e i n g t r u l y
fundamental? Again, I think not.
I would put to you then, that the
only fundamental right that
obtains in an abortion case is that
of the unborn child to life. Do not
make the error of thinking that
'might' is 'right'. It is not, and can
never be.

Dear Editor
I would like to thank all the
people who helped me after my
accident on Sunday afternoon.
Especially those who carried me
down the stairs, held doors open
and drove me to the hospital and
then home. Also thanks to Beit
Security, St Stephens casuality
staff, Dr S Whiting and members
of Rag.
Yours gratefully
Ian Brown
Dear Sir
Mr Philip Cole in his letter of
16th November made a rather odd
statement over the calling of the
q u o r a t e at the last U G M ,
suggesting it was neither small or
undemocratic, can he possibly
believe that 294 students are
representatives of ICU as a
whole? Surely they will be more
likely to be members of an
interested pressure group. This
mechanism ensures that an
organized group of individuals do
not become controlled by elites,
or to lesser extent pluralist.
He also condemns thecalling of
quorate as a political action
designed to prevent a 'demo-
cratic' verdict on the motion. Yet
by definition had the vote been
t a k e n it w o u l d have been
undemocratic, this alone must be
a justification of Mr Burton's
action. It is likely that anybody
believing passionately in any
cause is going to use all weapons
at their disposal since they will
consider themselves right to do
so, that the ends justify the means,
this has been recognised ever
since Machiavelli wrote 'The
Prince'.
The other major point Mr Cole .
raised was that there should be a
guillotine in operation at U G M s ,
he indicates that it is preferable to
be efficient than to fully discuss
an issue, did he attend the
lectures on Totalitarianism? I
doubt whether any important
issue can be fully dealt with at a
U G M , to have six important
motions on one agenda is absurd
if anything of any importance is to
result. The executive must rethink
its policy on the planning of the
U G M rather than lapse into
hysterics because people leave
when they overrun.
Yours sincerely
