MOTION TO NEXT TUESDAY'S UGM
FROM THE FELIX EDITOR
Proposer: Colin Palmer
Seconder: B Smith
PUBLIC IMAGE OF ICU
ICU notes:
1. The thrashing of the IC team in a University Challenge television
programme, which was recorded on Wednesday 21 November 1979.
2. That Queen's College Cambridge beat IC by 390 points to 140.
3. That the national image of ICU has once again been tarnished.
4. The absence of the Exec and the College mascot at one of the rare
opportunities for ICU to win the public respect that we so richly deserve.
5. That the DP and the Hon Sec were both supporting each other at a
Haldane Library committee meeting, which they considered more
important than attending an event that will influence millions of people's
opinions of IC.
6. The full coverageand assistance given by STOIC, IC Radio and FELIX
to the IC University Challenge team.
7. That the team was not suited to the questions asked as it was made up
of a group of tea-slurping active heterosexual gentlemen.
8. That Bamber Gascoigne remained cool during what must have been
an extremely boring programme for him to compere.
9. That the audience filmed for the closing sequence of the IC
programme consisted mainly of Sussex Students.
10. That the audience filmed for the closing sequence of the Sussex
programme consisted mainly of IC students.
11. The failure of the Cambridge team's bell and the slowness of the IC
team to get their finger out to capitalise on the situation.
ICU believes:
1. That a team made up of beer-swilling latent homosexual louts could
do no worse than last week's team.
2. University Challenge is viewed by the public as one of the ultimate
tests of university education in this country.
3. That either the style of questions on University Challenge should
change or that the education given at'IC should cover a wider spectrum
of knowledge.
4. That the audience who obtained the IC London sign, from the TV
studio, showed greater initiative and ability than the team,
5. That more women should be encouraged to come to IC so that
students receive a broader education and will therefore have a better
chance of scoring.
IC instructs:
1. ICU Exec to select a team made up of intelligent beer-swilling latent
homosexual louts, when/if they are ever invited to appear on University
Challenge again.
2. A representative of the ICU Exec to attend all student events,
featuring IC, that receive media coverage
3. ICU Exec to send the College mascot to all events when
representatives of ICU are asked to appear on television broadcasts.
4. ICU Exec to write a letter to Bamber Gascoigne thanking him for
inviting IC to take part and also asking him to ensure that our team will
be able to answer the questions next time by ensuring that more science
questions are included in the programme.
5. The Exec to inform the Rector of the contents of this motion.
6. Prospective University Challenge team members to attend
Associated Studies lectures.
