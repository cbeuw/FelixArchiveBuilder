THE RCS F L O A T RAG PROCESSION
YOU'RE NEVER TOO OLD TO JOIN A
PLAYGROUP
Think what it's like to be alone, miles
from home (which may even be in
another country) and also very ill.
handicapped or undergong a series of
operations It's even worse if you're
only six years old.
At the Great Ormond Street Hospital
there are a great many children in that
situation. But there's something that
makes things a little better for them -
the playgroups and activities
organised by Rob Pike, the voluntary
help co-ordinator. He'd like people,
like you, to help to run the playgroups
on woodwork, playing with toy cars,
dolls - all the things you did as a kid at
home.
The playgroups take place every
weekday at 9:30-12:30 in the morning
and 1:30-4:30 in the afternoon, with
extra activities during the evenings and
at weekends
If you think yu could spare a few hurs a
week helping in the playgroups, please
contact me via the letter racks or come
to one of the I C C A G meetings on
Mondays in the Union (3rd floor -
follow the signs) at 12:30pm.
