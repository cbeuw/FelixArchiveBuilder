His authority on the subject i s unquestionable. This talk i s bound to give an
insight into the working of the Commission and the problems that need to be tackled.
It w i l l furthermore be one man's p r a c t i c a l approach to a dilemma that c a r r i e s with i t

The Nuclear Power Debate
On the opening day of ICU's Environmental Week, Mr L G Brookes
(from the Atomic Energy Authority) will propose the motion: "This
house believes that nuclear power is the energy source of the future".
The motion will be seconded by Dr Goddard (from Mech Eng at IC) and
opposed by Professors Jeffery (Birkbeck College) and Scorer (Maths at
IC).
Following the 'Three Mile Island Disaster" the nuclear controversy has
flared up afresh. After about three or four years of use, Uranium fuel is
withdrawn from the thermal nuclear reactor and the waste remaining
after processing to recover plutonium is highly radioactive.
Should this waste be 'vitrified' (stored as solid 'glass')? It should
ideally remain undamaged for up to 1,000 years and withstand
temperature variations between 0 and 100 degrees centigrade.
Can we afford to invest our energy future in nuclear power? Can we
afford not to?
C o m e and hear these experts examining the arguments.

Chemical aspects of Farming and
Food Production
With 50,000 hectares of land i n B r i t a i n being l o s t each year to roads and expanding
towns, e f f i c i e n t a g r i c u l t u r a l production i s a growing necessity i n B r i t a i n . In fact
we are remarkably successful and are with Holland,the most e f f i c i e n t farmers i n
Europe. But what i s the cost? Energy intensive f e r t i l i s e r s have to be used i n
increasing q u a n t i t i e s , pests are becoming resistant to the chemicals used against
them, not to mention n i t r a t e contamination of our water supplies, serious impact on
our w i l d l i f e and l o s s of a t t r a c t i v e hedgerows. What i s the a g r i c u l t u r a l future for
B r i t a i n ?
