Dear Colin
I would like to take this
opportunity to reply to lan
Hodgson's valuable letter in last
week's FELIX. I disagree, for
reasons which will become
apparent, with his statement that
my views on the C C U s (ie that
t h e y a r e t r i b a l a n d a n t i -
i n t e l l e c t u a l ) are Irrelevant.
However, I do most strongly agree
with him when he pointed out that
the high standard of entry
requirements for this entirely
science based college leads a lot
of people to develop 'very narrow
m i n d s ' . T h i s m e n t a l i t y M r
Hodgson suggests gives rise to
the C C U s as they are at present
constituted.
I would therefore suggest, in the
light of my views on the C C U s ,
that it would be valuable to
enquire into the factors which Mr
Hodgson cites. It appears that at
the end of the first term a
considerable number of first year
students leave the college never
to return. Now while some of
these have probably decided that
Physics, Mining etc are not for
them, I would suggest that some
leave because they cannot stand
college life. How do the C C U s
reconcile this with their platitudes
about helping first years to settle
in? I would suggest that the C C U s
are a contributory factor, though
not the only one, in helping
people to make up their minds
that they should leave.
Therefore while the C C U s are,
as Mr Hodgson rightly suggests,
an effect of pressures within the
college, we can also see that they
are because of their tribal
structure, which, as I have
previously pointed out, enforces a
certain kind of conformity, (dare I
say 'beer-swilling') contributors
to that pressure. I would therefore
suggest that we should put our
own house in order (ie reform the
C C U S s as they are part of ICU) as
well as exerting our influance to
abate the other detrimental
pressures which Mr Hodgson
suggests exists within the college.
Yours sincerely
Frank James
Sir
I feel it is necessary to comment
on lan Hodgson's unjustified and
ill-substantiated remarks about
Steve Hutching's letter (FELIX
532) in the last edition of FELIX.
By admitting he does not know
the facts of the matter, he made
his already illogical change of
topic even more ludicrous. I fail to
see how his comments on C C U s
are in any way related to the
copyright of Steve's photo-
graphs.
For the benefit of Mr Hodgson, I
will repeat some facts here.
D e s p i t e a s s u r a n c e s to the
contrary Steve recieved no credit
for his photograph of Barney
M c C a b e a n d Jim Sarsfield (FELIX
529). Subsequently Colin Palmer
intended to publish in FELIX a
copy of Steve's photograph of the
R C S Exec which appeared on the
cover of Broadsheet (vol 12 no 3)
and the front page of a local
newspaper. Steve (who had not
even been asked) refused to let'
publication take place.
It was at this point the letter was
w r i t t e n to C o l i n P a l m e r
concerning copywright and it was
not intended for publication
although not making this clear
was obviously an oversight on the .
part of Steve. Thus taken out of,
the context it was written in (from
one individual to another) it may
seem a bit pedantic.
It has already been pointed out
to me that FELIX is a student
newspaper with limited circula-
tion and not a national daily, but
surely it is the principle that
matters. Steve is a keen amateur
photographer who trys hard to
maintain his own very high
personal standards and perhaps
m o r e i m p o r t a n t l y t a k e s an
obvious pride in his work. For this
r e a s o n he (and any other
photographer) has a right to
expect some acknowledgment for
his efforts.
A s avid readers of FELIX will
appreciate there must have been
some justification in his letter as
the issue it was published in was
innundated with credits which
appeared almost as miraculously
as the printer and publishers'
name did (FELIX 529) after the
Rag Mag controversy.
Yours faithfully

Dear Sir
I would liketouseyourcolumns
to thank a number of people who
have done a lot of good for this
college over the last week.
Firstly, all those people who
helped with or contributed to the
Cambodia collection last Friday,
which enabled me to put a cheque
for Â£230 in the post at the
beginning of this week.
Secondly, to the 300 people
who gave blood on Monday and
Tuesday, and the hundreds more
who had to be turned away.
Hopefully the B T S may be able to
fit in another day this term, along
with some more free tea and you'll
have your chance then. I'm sorry
about all this trouble with the
blood doning, much of which was
caused by the higher than average
t u r n o u t c o u p l e w i t h t h e
unannounced arrival of the Rag
Committee's 'Real Ale' in the
C o n c e r t H a l l o n S u n d a y
afternoon.
Thank you very much
John Whitehouse
Dear Sir
I must write in reply to Ian
Hodgson's letter (FELIX no 533)
which takes a verbal sideswipe at
me that I am not going to allow to
pass unanswered.
He wrote (referring to my letter,
FELIX no 532), " O K I don't know
the facts....", but surely this means
he did not read my letter properly
in the first place. I stated the facts
as clearly and concisely as
possible but it seems by point was
not grasped. Therefore I will
briefly restate the important
details whilst endeavouring to
answer the points raised by Mr
Hodgson.
I have taken, and will take, a
large number of photographs
depicting student activity at IC. I
have no objection to anyone at IC
using any of these photographs
provided that they ask me first (a
matter of courtesy) and that when
the photograph is used I receive
some form of credit as a mark of
the work I have put in to produce
that picture.
Mr Hodgson wrote, "Surely a
simple and absolutely trivial
matter like that can be solved
without threats?" That is the only
part of the paragraph with which I
have any agreement. I will pass
over the, "absolutely trivial" by
merely saying I don't regard a
potential criminal offence, ie
breach of copyright, as trivial. I
made every effort to resolve the
situation reasonably, speaking to
Colin on several occasions. When
this had no result I wrote the letter.
It was not intended to read as
threatening, merely as caution-
ary. The effect of this caution can
be measured by the fact that in the
last two copies of FELIX (nos 532
and 533) almost all the pictures
have carried a credit.
I'll close by considering the
most ludicrous part of lan
H o d g s o n ' s l e t t e r . H a v i n g
professed his ignorance of the
facts he then sees fit to pass
judgement on me, condemning
me as, "a power mad prat", whose
letter, "got right up my nose". I am
neither a prat nor power mad and
how he could infer either or both
of these from my letter is a total
mystery. Neither will I stoop so
low as to "be excused the use of a
most distasteful expression" in
describing what I think of lan
Hodgson's letter. All I can say is I
hope the majority of students at IC
can write better letters than his. "If
not, what hope for the world?"
Yours
Steve Hutchings

Dear Colin
Just dropping you a line to
thank all the people who rowed for
R C S on Morphy Day. Including
the Morphy, Lowry and Rugby
eights and especially the Ladies'
team and coxes.
Also many undying thanks to
the R C S Motor Club heroes who
have toiled for so long and have
been rewarded at last by the sight
of J E Z E B E L running again.
Namely Jon Hall, Nigel Reditt,
Dave Dodge, Martin Watson and
Andy Wilson.

Dear Ed
Since I find it almost impossible
to obtain a copy of FELIX, not
even a discarded one, I have
concluded that your organ must
be b o t h w i d e l y r e a d a n d
treasured. This, coupled with the
fact that there are a great many
Iranian and Moslem students at IC
has prompted me to write
regarding the situation in Iran.
Whilst everyone is aware of the
attacks against foreign diplomatic
staff, my concern is more with the
rights of individual Iranians.
There has been a lack of human
rights in Iran for many years, but
since the beginning of this year
the s i t u a t i o n has w o r s e n e d
considerably.
The present regime have
emasculated the press, suppres-
sed the political and religious
activities of minorities and
eradicated the very rich Persian
culture. The streets of Tehran are
ruled by the mob and intimidation
pervades every aspect of daily life.
Unemployment is running at 20%,
inflation at 30%, there are many
shortages and the economy,
despite large oil revenues, is
stagnating. Women have been
amongst those worst affected.
A p a r t f r o m t h e o b v i o u s
restrictions in personal and family
rights there are now proposals
that married women will not be
permitted to attend institutions of
higher education. The regime is
even a threat to world peace
because of its interference in
neighbouring countries.
All this is being carried out in
the name of Islam, but this is
nothing more than a veil to hide
the ugly face of fascism. Khomeini
wallows in self-aggrandisement,
something the Prophet never
allowed himself. With executions,
floggings and imprisonments, the
order of the day, they seem to
have forgotten the teachings of
Imam AM that there is a pleasure in
forgiveness which there is not in
revenge.
I urge everyone to support
those opposing this oppressive
regime and in particular moslems
whose religion is being brought
into disrepute.
Yours sincerely
Philip Nash Metallurgy
