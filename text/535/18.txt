BILLIARDS AND SNOOKER CLUB
T h e team o f the week was I C ' C team, w h o
traumatically a n d resolutely confounded their
opposition and w o n 5-0 to go top of the league. I
won't reminisce on the fact but it speaks for itself; so
without m a k i n g a mountain out of mole hill or a
twenty break out of A T E t e m a d i , I ' l l pass to the
next match.
T h e A team played Q M C expecting to get well
thrashed and «this nearly happened except they
meandered to a 4-1 w i n . First o n was Dave
Crossedout who might be the w i n d o w to watch but
is catastrophically not the player to watch. H i s
snooker is enough to bore the pants off a pregnant
rhinoceros but he is good with the yellow (ethnic
comments deleted). H e won (I bet you all wanted
to hear that).
Next Titlock came on the table and then came to
the table to play snooker (I think he performs the
former better). A s the Pressy, he's supposed to set a
good example but he's going through adolescence
just at the moment, so we understand his nervous
acne a n d nocturnal emmissive problems even
though he fluked a historic victory.
O n third was M L o u d l o v e r whose snooker
ability has been compared to C h a r l i e W i l l i a m s
jokes a n d Les Dawson's piano playing. Barmaids
aside. L o u d l o v e was l a u g h i n g raucously at his o w n
pla\ through out the match a n d at the end, his
festering carcus was debauched and exhumed from
the snooker room. (I hear he was resurrected
afterwards). H e w o n o n the black (Fuck knows
how).
T h e next player for a game was Geoff 'that
"Caroline's got nice legs' K e y m e r suffering from a
slight touch o f Calvert's Snookeritis Uselessitis lost
his first game ever; forever o r ever. T h e tear drops
smudged his mascara a n d his frothing lips spread
blue lipstick until after an eon's torment, he at last
realised he couldn't for God's sake, play bloody
snooker and w h y because our numero uno player,
the evil C o u n t F r a n k e n t r i p (Chrissipooes) has
shattered his bollacks, in shooting into first place.
H o w c a n this recognised alcoholic do this to the
g e n t l e c u d d l y K e y m e r . E a s y w i t h t h e
determination.of a bottle of R i b e n a (that's aLr>ut
how m u c h it needs), he also won.
T e a m : C Sidetrip, G M u r k y , D Crossroads, M
Loudlover, S Titlock.
T h e infamous A team fought a tough, g n i , i n g ,
sadistic, masochistic, blood bath at C h a r e Cross.
T h e first player was that superheavy weight, Billy
Bunter division brawler S Bendit. W h a t a player
Has an I C player showed such sheer lack of fibre. If
he thinks the balls are really bollock shaped, I think
he better just examine his o w n for a minute or two
or else just start supporting Bristol Rovers. O f
course, he lost miserably, b u ; like ht said: " Y o n
can't teach a n o l d d o g how to screw if he doesn't
know already". A n d as for C h r i s Calvert, well I
never (except twice a week). Chrissipnopooes,
without sanjitters backing h i m up.. ., wa~ as
successful as a eunuch i n a brothel. H e did come
second however w h i c h gets you a silver medal into
O l y m p i c s but Chris, old fruit, only gets you a kick
in the groin in IC. (You're groins must be ^ c h n g b y
now.)
So 2-0 d o w n , Gene Stevens came to the table.
T h i s keen physics bofT, soon brought his opponents
ego d o w n to his o w n m i n i m a l level. B e i n g
constantly eyed by several Miss W o r l d contenders,
as the next best thing to A l Pacino, he stroked hs
way to a ballbusting exhibition of true universal
dimensions.
Into the limelight crawled Tomsk, d o i n g natural
inv'iessions of a fresh turd. ACter some heckling
, :
mi .he cannibalistic ai.dience, visualising T o m s k
letween two sheets of bread (turd sandwich), he
proceeded <vith tongue in m o u t h brilliance.
C h e c k i n g his two teeth were still i n his mouth, he
whistled the firs red i n to the pocket followed by
the vv'.iite, his cue and his nose. Some how, giving
nim som'- credit just for existance, he won and was
ejected i r o m the table by a passionate Leclezio
(who says, red black, red black, white is Leclezio
missing a break). A y a t h o l l a h Leclezio (greatest
fan) w o n easily a n d afterwards released his
hostages (his o w n team mates). F i n a l score was 3-2
to I C .
T e a m : A Doubleglazio. T Maladjusted, S Beans
(Capt), C Pervert and S Bent.

I C W a t e r Polo C l u b d i d not get ofTto a good start
in the Middlesex League this year. I C 2nds h a d
their first match o n N o v e m b e r 6th against Enfield
(away). In the first quarter I C took some time to
settle against a team with more enthusiasm than
skill. B y the end of the first quarter we were 3-0
d o w n and they scored two more goals in the second
quarter. After the second break. I C went into their
stride. N i c k B u c k l a n d and N i c k Last were playing
well at the back and Pat Porter and M i k e Casey
were passing the ball accurately mid-pool. I C
broke through a n d D i m i t r i Papaconstantinou
scored o u r first goal, a c u n n i n g shot, after a fine
pass from A d r i e n Butler. W e kept the pressure o n
and K o s t a R i b a r scored o u r second goal, w h i c h
was an expertly placed shot c o m i n g from the half-
way line. Enfield, however, hit back with even
more strength a n d put two more goals in the net.
K o s t a scored our first goal in the fourth quarter, as
a final attempt to get I C back in the match; but the
opposition scored two more goals to make the final
score 3-9.
But the worst was yet to come. T h e next day I C
2nds had their second match of the season against
Hounslow (away). T h e first two quarters
Hounslow seemed to have played all their o w n way
and they managed to score seven goals. However,
in the third quarter I C pulled together as a team
and started attacking fiercely. O u r veteran player
J i m W i l l i a m s scored an exquisite goal, our only one
of the night (well d o n e j i m ! ) . After that, H o u n s l o w
came back into the attack a n d started breaking
through yet again I C ' s slightly disorganized
defence. T h e y scored five more goals (shame!) until
the final score was, dare I say, 1-12.
So. I C 2nds started their season with two defeats
w h i c h w o u l d have been heavier if Dave Roberts
hadn't been playing both matches away!
T e a m : D Roberts. N B u c k l a n d , N Last, P Porter,
M Casey. D C h a d w i c k . A Butler. K R i b a r , D
Papaconstantinou and J Williams.
O n November 12th it was I C Ists turn to show
what they could do. T h e y p4a\ed a good strong
game against T o w e r Hamlets (away again!). T h e
I C attack pushed forward from the throw in, and
T A B L E TENNIS
Matches two weeks ago (no report last
week because , even I get sick of writing this
drivel!):
IC 1 vs Exiles 5: 6-3
IC 2 vs Inco: 3-6
IC 3 vs ED&FMAN S&SC (what a mouthful!):
9-0.
Now last week. The firsts beat Hong Kong
Students Club 6-3, with Hong winning 1
(ironic!), Kartick 2 and Pete 3. The seconds
lost again to NALGO (and this time it was due
to an off-day for their previously top player) -
never mind Andy, your resignation has been
accepted. (Only 3-6 though, again). The
thirds had their hardest match thus far, only
winning 6-3. Their opponents Marks and
S p e n c e r , h o w e v e r , had i m p r o v e d

tremedously from last year. (Even I won 3-3
against them!)
Of course the most 'important' match was
the fourths vs Thames Water Authority. I
actually won all my (two) games (only two
because one of their players failed to arrive)
for the first time this season - ah happy days!
Well after a particularly boring report
(especially as you've all been waiting two
weeks for it) I think I'll stop before I fall asleep.
Oh! But I haven't mentioned enough
superstars so, special praise to Bob Edde (2
wins for the seconds) and Hans Joseffson
(who has never played in a team before) for
not losing more than 11 points out of 21 in any
game - cheers!
our efforts brought quick results. M i k e M c C a r t n e y
scored o u r first goal and A n d y S m i t h our second.
T h e opposition, however, d i d not weaken and they
scored a goal at the end of the first quarter a n d two
more in the second. But I C were not going to let
them get away with it. T h e defence was passing the
ball quickly u p front a n d Cliff Spooner was
expertly coordinating the moves of the team. M i k e

ULU FALLS TO IC
• Volleyball is one or the most popularsports
in the world, more sc even than football. It is
not very widespread in Britain, although
many colleges do run teams. IC is one of
these and plays one match a week in the
league.
Although previous performances have
been poor, on Wednesday the team
remembered how to play volleyball, and
eventually gave a fine display of good class
play, beating ULU by 3 sets to 2.
Starting badly, only 2 points were scored in
the first two sets, but IC soor. came back to
win sets 3 and 4 convincingly and built up a
14-8 lead in the final set, eventually scoring
the winning point after several ferocious
rallies. The final score was 0-15, 2-15, 15-7,
and 15-12.
The team was: Suki Kalirai (court capt),
Andy Ciuksza, Henry Szyszko, Marek
Banasiak, Dave Penty, Peter Dias-Lalcaca,
Lech Bogdanowicz, Tony Briers, Marc Young
(capt) and S Tarn.
Thanks go to our few (but vocal)
supporters, Vic Tybulewicz and Carolyn
Wainwright.
