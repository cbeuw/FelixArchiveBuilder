Introduction and talk; The
Greening of Britain.
In the l a s t ten years there has been a massive rethink on the way we should treat
our environment. Expanding industry, enormous increases i n the generation of energy
and the rapid spread of c i t i e s have had a great impact on our available resources.
The adverse r e s u l t of t h i s impact by p o l l u t i o n , the r i s i n g p r i c e of o i l , leading to
the expansion o f the nuclear industry and a need for increasingly e f f i c i e n t a g r i c u l t -
u r a l production made people increasingly aware that environmental decisions and
l e g i s l a t i o n were d i r e c t l y a f f e c t i n g them.
Various organisations were set up to involve people more i n environmental issues.
Friends of the Earth (FOE) i s probably the most well known, best informed and most
active of these groups.
It i s appropriate that ICU's Environmental Week i s being opened by a talk from Tom
Burke who was c l o s e l y involved i n setting up FOE and was one of t h e i r f i r s t d i r e c t o r s .
He i s going to give an o v e r a l l view of the environmental landmarks of the l a s t ten
years and t h e i r relevance to the present environmental scene. This w i l l help you put
a l l the forthcoming discussions of Environmental Week into context.
