U.G.M. FALLS ASLEEP

WAS I . C . U . 0 : L O R D V I C F E A T H E R 1.
The meeting was opened, by the President banging
a discus with a gavel. T h i s was followed by a routine,
well known to U G M addicts, of minute of the last
meeting and matters arising. John Carr, U L U
President, made a short speech in which he outlined
various aspects of Union life. T h i s was followed by
the President saying
something about refect-
ories, the ladies loo
(private quote: 'We do
not want to get bogged
down on that issue'),
Overseas students and a
few other things. The
proceedings were slightly
livened up by a few yawns
from some obviously bored
members. There were a
number of routine quest-
ions on refectories —
some postgraduates com-
plained that P G ' s were
not informed of the 17Vi%
price increase. Seeing as
how postgraduates i n
general take little or no
notice of the Union, one
wonders what he was
complaining about. Some-
body else complained
about the food, but then
this i s nothing unusual.
The Hon. Secretary said
something about parking,
and this was followed by
the Deputy President
saying something about
something.
The next item on the
agenda was Constitutional
amendments. The first
set were non-contentious
but Just as discussion
was about to start on the
P G Affairs Officer, some-
body stood up and said
that since it was con-
tentious, it should be
postponed. Members
promptly went back to
sleep.
Trev P h i l l i p s proposed
a motion on grants per-
taining to the various
anomalies; this was
passed, the quorum was
challenged, those present
were woken up by the
Deputy President banging
VIC *T 1C
the discus with his gavel
and saying 'the meeting
i s closed', and that was
that. It was a well des-
erved win by Lord Feather
who was giving a lecture
simultaneously.
L O R D VIC F E A T H E R was at
Imperial College last Tuesday
giving an Associated Studies
lecture entitled 'The Political
Scene'. The Lecture w u
extremely well attended—which
possibly accounts for the
absymal attendance at the
UGM.
