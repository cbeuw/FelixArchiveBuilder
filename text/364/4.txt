ICWA P * £ S I D £ N T
Monday night of this week saw the launching of a hopefully
successful year for ICWA. Apart from a few unfortunate errors
in the seating plan (for which I really do apoligise) the dinner
went off quite smoothly considering I organised it!
Mr. Stan Arnold's cabaret afterwards was nothing less than
excellent — and I'm sure no-
one who went to the dinner
.could disagree. My thanks to
Mr. Arnold for making the
evening so enjoyable. We had
a bar extension until 1 a.m.
which appeared to be still
being propped up when I sleep-
walked out of the SCR about
1.30 a.m. I very much hope
that everyone who went (all
240 of you!) enjoyed them-
selves and will continue to
support us for the rest of the
year at other functions.
For those oT you unfortunate
enough to have missed the
dinner, make sure you don't
miss the other events we're
laying on in the next few
weeks.
In respect of this, I should
like to remind you that on
Halloween, the 31st of October
we're holding a Masked Ball.
To have made this occasion
fancy dress, I think would only
have discouraged people from
coming. So, I've compromised
and I'm insisting on people
wearing masks. They'll be
easy to come by at that time
of year with Guy Fawkes night
so near — or you could easily
make your own. Details of
what will be happening, will
appear in next week's F E L I X ,
and on posters which should
be out next week, too. Tickets
will be available as from
Monday, price 50p (see below).
All that remains for me to
say is I hope you will alt make
an effort to come oh Halloween
(though numbers by necessity
will be limited), and to thank
everyone for coming on Monday.
For those of you who made
particular use of the bar ex-
tension, I hope the effects
have worn off by now.
