THE ANNUAL Tiddly-
winks marathon from Marble
Arch to Piccadilly Circus
via Regent Street, took
place last Saturday. The
whole show went off quite
smoothly. It was a special
feature for the public who
found it hilarious to see
over one hundred IC students
grovelling on the pavement,
in some cases actually on
the road, with tiddly-winks.
Mines out to avenge
their defeat last year by
C & G went off well before
anyone else and conseq-
uently finished in first,
second and fourth positions.
The third position is still
open. Mines collected a
total of £183.71% using 30
cans. Their highest indiv-
idual total was made by
Tanya Frost who collected
£22.44 and this included a
£20 note donated by an Arab
shiek.
C &G collected £248.67%
from 54 cans and their big-
gest individual total of
£15.88% was collected by
Janice Ford. RCS collected
the grand sum of £287.99%.
Unfortunately during the
count, their cans were mixed
up (they had 99 of them) and
so have no biggest indiv-
idual total. The reason
they collected more than
anyone else was that they
gave cans and winks to all
their participants.
The proceeds from the
race are in aid of the Leu-
kemia Research Fund, the
British Polio Fellowship
and Guide Dogs for the
Blind. The amount collected,
£700.38% is £70 up on last
year'sfigure. Congratulations
to the Rag Committee for a
great race.
