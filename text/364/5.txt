....if you are a folk music fan and missed the two Folk Club
Concerts this week. However, it's not too late to join, come in
and see us, any Wednesday in the Union Lower Refectory, from
8.00 onwards.
Enough of the advertising. Now for the fun part - reviews.
On Monday, Martin Carthy
started the" term off with a
bang (no, not THAT kind of
bang). About 200 people came,
and thoroughly enjoyed a good
evening of traditional folk,
sung both unaccompanied, and
with guitar. Martin is very
popular because of his friendly
attitude towards audiences —
singing several chorus songs
(which everyone loves, don't
they?! That's why they sing so
loud. ha. ha.) and did three
encores.
Wednesday, the concert was
in a completely contrasting
vein — parlour music. Very
prim Victorian songs (you
must be joking) from a duo
called Mr. Gladstone's Bag -
an unparalleled success to be
recorded in the annals of Folk
Club (who's swallowed a
dictionary then!). Their songs
range from one about a son
lost in the War, (in which one
of the duo pretends to be a
chair) to a very explicit little
parody of Gilbert and Sullivan,
the subject of which is the
female anatomy (shame on you
for thinking what you're
thinking now). This was the
second concert they've done
here, both very successful, so
if you missed them, keep your
eyes open, they'll be back.
Also, this concert was re-
commended in Melody Maker's
Pick of the Folk.
If you were unfortunate
enough to miss these excellent
entertainments, never fear! We
have a concert every week,
Rosie Hardman (of The Old
Grey Whistle Test and Cam-
bridge Festival fame) is on
this week, and later in the term
people like Fred Wedlock —
the Folker, Magic Lantern, and
- wait for it — a ceilidh'. See
you there.
