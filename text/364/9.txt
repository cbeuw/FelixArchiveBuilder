DESPITE RUMOURS to the contrary, the
in existence. Although somewhat hampered
reservoir had been drained, 'cos UC kept
and succeeded in weakening it. A team of
of Scottish clubs on the Firth of Forth and
friends, went to the 24 hour
dinghy race in Southport —
and actually came away with
a pot. Individual successes
over the summer were good,
with Pete Barrett winning the
Mirror nationals, and Tony
Bambridge doing well in Solos.
This term we shall be
running matches at weekends
and are desperately trying to
find somewhere to sail on
Wednesdays. We also have a
cheese and wine party early in
the term. Anyone interested
in joining, or even helping
(the examiners were not too
kind on our committee) should
get in touch with Brian Rogers
(Commodore) via the Civ. Eng.

Sailing Club is still

CONCEAT

Gong
Anyone passing Cambridge Gardens on
the morning of October 6th, may have
noticed two bodies and a baseball cap,
no rucksacks and no transit vans. This
was because Gee and I were on our way
to the Hammersmith Palais to see the
wondrous Gong.
Leaving the world of Victorian, grey
brick houses, painted sadly pink, of
sodden newspapers trodden into the
pavement and of wrecked Morris 1000's
we headed for a land where pothead
pixies, banana nirvana, octave doctors
and flying teapots are the order of the
day.
First up were Good Habit, not in the
startling green monk's robes they have a
habit of wearing, and apparently with a
new line-up. They played some rollicking
jazz/rock which was definitely good fun.
Then came Isotope who treated us to
their brand of introverted class-rock;
lots of jolly spiffing chord sequences
strung together and taken very seriously.
Indeed so serious was it, that the drummer
appeared to be in some amount of pain.
At last up crept Daevid Allen, res-
plendent in fiourescent make up and
pixie hat, to inform us that we were
about to hear a story of pothead pixies,
their radio station ('radio gnome' which
transmits from a flying teapot), their
meeting with earthmen, notably Zero the
Hero, Zero's visit to the planet Gong and
f i na I ly the consequences for the i nhabi tants
of Earth, namely a new age of under-
standing. On came the rest of the band
and away we went. It was all packed
with meaning and purpose.
In case you don't know, Gong is a
band of seven people, normally domicile
in France. They were thrown together
by the inimitable Daevid Allen, (who was
with Soft Machine before they made
records) and now have four records
released in Britain, all making stunning
progress up the L P charts (i.e. the one
in the window at Virgin Records). Their
music is characterised by beautiful
synthesizer playing, a very distinctive
saxophone sound, the 'Space Whisper'
of 'Shakki Yoni' and somewhat esoteric
lyrical content. In fact at this concert
the lyrics were often unintelligible but
all the loonies there knew the words
off by heart, so everyone was happy.
So, for an hour and a half, the audience
was transported into a state of bemused
bliss until, after one brief encore, the
management of the Hammersmith Palais
decided to restore sanity by ending the
proceedings.
There are a few people who tell me
that these flights into fantasy are bad
for my head and I could spend my time
better reading the telephone directory or
'Coser and Rosenburg'. I remain
unconvinced.
