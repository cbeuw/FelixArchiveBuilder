FELIX SPORT
R o b J o n e s RUGBY CLUB
As this is m
y first sports editorial of the session I
would like to take this opportunity of welcoming to the
college all the freshers and welcoming back all the old
lags who passed their exams.
By now all the clubs, with the exception of the summer sports,
have most probably held their
trials and I hope everyone
enjoyed them and is now
looking forward to the first
fixtures of the new season.
I think a special mention
must be given to the freshers
with the idea of encouraging
more of them to take an active
part in the sports clubs.
Imperial is very proud of its
sporting achievements and
boasts some of the best sporti ng
facilities in London, and is
most definitely the best of all
the other colleges in London.
These facilities are for your
use, make the most of them and
you can be guaranteed a very
enjoyable stay at IC.
Last but not least in this
small note, I would like to
encourage A L L clubs to write
reports for F E L I X . Reports
with photographs (the negatives
are required) should reach me
by no later than Monday morn-
ing of each week for editing,
so pull your fingers out and
get writing.
Best of luck to everyone
for the coming season.
The Rugby Club formally started its season with constituent
college finals on Wednesday 2nd October - each college having
about 20 freshers to look at.
The trials were followed by a highly successful pie 'n' mash,
at which the main attraction was two free barrels of beer supplied

The HOCKEY C L U B , despite the title, is far from backward.
Todays club is going places fast: Wapping, Nersden and Finchley
to name but a few.
Seriously though, we run three Imperial College sides on
Saturdays playing both club and college fixtures. In recent years
we have endeavoured to improve
our fixture list as standards
have gone from strength to
strength and the first team
gained a place in the newly
formed Truman (Brewers!)
League.
Wednesday matches are
played by an IC 1st XI and
constituent college teams.
Each year an Imperial College
side competes in the Univer-
sity of London Challenge Cup
which, needless to say, has
been won by us twice in the
last three years.
Most Sundays men and
women combine to play mixed
hockey: a little hockey with a
good after-the-game social.
Notable fixture: v. Guinness

The team each year takes
off in the Easter vacation and
it is hoped that this year a
continental tour may be or-
ganised.
Finally a plug for the not-
to-be-missed P i e and Mash
Pxxx up in the Union Dining
Hall after the matches on
Wednesday 16th October.
Any budding hockey players
(whether international or
'walking stick' standard)
wishing to join, should contact
Tim Hanson (Chem. Eng. 3)
or come along to the Union any
Wednesday or Saturday lunch
time.

TEN PIN BOWLING CLUB
The Tenpin Bowling Club is not exactly the largest club in
IC, but this is probably more of an advantage than otherwise,
as you very quickly get to know the people you bowl with!
As we have done in the past we run an internal league on
Wednesday afternoons and also bowl in the English Universities
League on some weekends,
where our opponents in the
southern region are Southampton
and Brunei Universities,
University College and Ports-
mouth Poly. Aside from the
league bowling, our members
also bowl in University tour-
naments throughout the country
(both travel and entrance fees
being heavily subsidised) so
you can see that although

see the World' might be an
exaggeration, we do get around
a bit!
Our bowling costs are
among the cheapest in the
country, at 13p per game, and
to counteract the cost of travel
we have a unique rebate system
by which for every time a
member turns up, he/she gets
I0p back from the club.
We are always glad to see
new members (especially those
of the fairer sex!) whether they
have bowled before or not, and
for the latter people we willingly
give instruction. Membership
is not restricted to IC students
and any student who's college
does not have a bowling club
can join ours.
Anyone who would like to
join, or just have a chat about
the club can either meet us
outside the IC Union Arch at
1.00 p.m. on Wednesday after-
noons, or contact me through
the Royal School of Mines
letter rack or leave a note on
the IC Union noticeboard in
the Lower Lounge.
by the late Lt. Col. Sir
van Ryneveldt, who most
generously left the club in
excess of £200 in his will.
A ceremonial eight pint pot
and six one pint pots have
been bought with this money
and were officially 'christened'
at this function. It is hoped
to erect a memorial plaque to
Lt. C o l . Sir van Ryneveldt in
the Union Bar in the near
future.
Trials were again held on
Saturday 5th October, but these
were far less successful than
those of the previous Wednesday
due to the poor turn out of
freshers — only thirteen com-
pared to sixty. I can only hope
that this is a freak happening
and strongly urge freshers to
make the effort to play on
Saturdays. It is far too easy
to sit at home watching tele-
vision on Saturdays or generally
doing nothing, but it is far
more enjoyable and rewarding
to come out and play Rugby.
The first fifteen programme
starts on Wednesday 9th
October, with the London
School of Economics (LSE)
to be played at our ground at
Harlington and a block fixture
with Cheshunt R F C is arranged
for the following Saturday,
hopefully for four teams.
I hope that the club has
the successful season that it
deserves and I am sure that it
will, if the support from the
old lags continues and if many
more freshers COME AND
JOIN US.
