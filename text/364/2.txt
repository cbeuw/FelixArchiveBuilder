WITH R E F E R E N C E to the Tuesday
groan of a UGM, the question is What
went wrong? The number of minutes of
interesting discussion can be counted
on the fingers, and still leave sufficient
anatomy to stifle a yawn. In terms of
the number of Union members in attend-
ance, the benefit of the doubt must be
granted. Certainly Vic Feather is a
great crowd-puller and theatre B in
College Block, where he was presenting
his lecture, was a mass of bodies with
an overspill into the corridors. But in
terms of quality, the UGM was pusill-
animous and uninspiring in the extreme.
What happened to the promises of a
dynamic leadership, the invulnerable
initiative, the infectious motivation?
It has been suggested that the reason
why the meeting was so quiet was
because it was under masterly control.
It could be stated what is the thought
of that idea, but i&not Editorial policy
to print obcenities.
Apologies are in order to John Allen,
Chairman of the Campus Radio Society
Committee. In the Valete section of the
last Editorial it was implied that one
individual was essentially responsible
for establishing Campus Radio and this
was what I had, in all honesty, been
led to believe. It was a regretful error
and no slight was intended to John and
his hard-working committee.
Belated congratulations are extended
to Ron K i l l , the Deputy President for
his work connected with the Freshers'
Fair this year. As far as could be seen,
all went very smoothly. There is one
aspect of the Fair which warrants
highlighting however. The distribution
of Societies in the Union gave rise to
a reflection of Ron's subtle sense of
humour when it was discovered that
Gaysoc had been allocated a stall in
the Games Room.
As can be seen from the F E L I X
credits below, a Business Manager has
finally been appointed in the form of
Chris Keenan who is also Editor of the
USK Handbook this year. The term
'Assistant Editor' is being discontinued
and hence Paul Ekpenyong will be the
Features Editor and Ramon Newmann,
the Photographic Editor. We should
also like to welcome Rob Jones on the
staff as the Sports Editor. There are
still vacancies for Reporters and News
Editors. Anyone interested should
contact the Editor, preferably on a
Monday or a Friday. We still need
general help on the production side,
especially Thursday evenings. Why not
come along and help out?
Finally, there is absolutely no truth
whatsoever, in the malicious rumour
that the Executive were pissed out of
their brains whilst assessing the Parking
Permit Applications. A l l they had to
drink were a few cans of Fosters and
two bottles of wine (apparently).

Dear Sir,
In my past two years as an
undergraduate at this college,
I feel that ICU has played a
fairly insignificant part in my
academic career. That is, of
course,' apart from the services
that we tend to take for granted,
such as entertainments, etcetera
Here, I am stating a view which
would probably be shared by a
large number of students, and
my grounds for saying this are
the meagre and unrepresentative
attendances at UGM's. In fact,
I would like to think that I am
speaking for the silent majority.
Prominent figures in the
union hierarchy bemoan the
appalling 'apathy' of the
average IC student. However,
my own experience of UGM's
in the past has been to sit and
listen, for a seemingly inter-
minable period, to a succession
of heated and boring arguments
over relatively trivial details
of a motion. Those who care
enough (or, have fallen asleep
in the interim) to remain for
the final vote, are frustrated
in their hopes when the meeting
becomes inquorate, because
most people have left to do
other things. Nevertheless, the
solution to this problem is
self-evident and I will not
dwell on it. I fear that the real
cause of the apathy in this
college, and very likely others,
is the inherent political nature
of the student unions.
The primary aim of ICU is
to represent the interests of
the students of this college
and it is the responsibility of
the executive to ensure that
this aim is achieved before
debating time at a UGM is
given over to other issues. I
would guess that the major
worries of students here are:
a) Where are they going to live?
b) How are they going to afford
being at college?
c) How (sooner or later) are
they going to get through
the exams?
Further, students need to be
protected ' against possible,
although infrequent, unfair or
discriminatory action by the1
college authorities. It is point-
less for ICU, or even the NUS,
to attempt to be a politically
active body. For an organisation
with these aspirations, to have
no intimate contact with the
population of the country is to
be politically impotent. The
NUS, let us fact it, does not
even enjoy the support of
public opinion.
Although only a minority of
IC students have strong pol-
itical views, which they have
a right to, be they right or left,

I do not think that a UGM
should be used as a platform.
The Union has political sub-
divisions within it for just this
purpose. Politics has little
relevance in an academic
institution, far less in a college -
of science and technology.
Let us devote more of the
UGMs to the average IC student
and then, maybe, he will show
up to vote more often.
Yours faithfully,
R.J. Merwood,
