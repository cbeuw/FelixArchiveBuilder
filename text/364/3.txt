ARE YOU HOMELESS? Desperately in need of a place to lay
your weary head (and preferably large enough to accommodate
your SX 727 stereo equipment)? Weir join the queue, there are
only another few thousand, and thank God I'm not one of them.
First of all it is no use living under any false illusions.
October is the worst time to
look for a flat and South
Kensington is the worst place
on earth to find one, unless of
course you have a sugar daddy/
mama among your acquaintances
who has enough concern for
your comfort and well-being
to lavish out vast sums of
money. For those of us sadly
lacking in this useful commodity
a course of action is definitely
called for. For most Freshers
at I.F. who arrive in London
not knowing anyone, the ob-
vious answer is to share a
flat via the flatshare columns
in the papers. Having myself
done the daily round of tele-
phone calls, beaten the weary
track to estate agencies and
repeated my life history a few
hundred times, I know the
problems only too well. First
piece of advice: avoid the ads
with no phone number and just
an address, at this time of
year you will turn up to find
something resembling a dry
party in full swing and will be
unable to see the colour of the
carpet for people, let alone
those responsible for the ad.
Now, someone has got to get
into this flat and unless you
are the absolute scum of the
earth you stand as good a
chance as the next person.
Your main task is to convince
the other people by subtle
means that you will be an asset
to their little community. First
of all, beg, steal or borrow an
E-type jaguar and as many
dishy men as will fit into it
(IC males in Moss. Bros, will
do at a pinch) and float in with
your entourage to view the pad.
Flashing the Benson and
Hedges casually inquire whether
it's okay to double-park the jag.
the tiddly-winks race ran out,
but was only there as a
spectator. Well, she probably
did not want to get her hands
dirty.

External
Affairs
ARE YOU interested in the National Union of
Students-in preparing for NUS conferences, getting
motions in, delegates elected, eh? Also In helping
out in the NUS campaigns on grants, racism, Chile,
South Africa, Northern Ireland etc.
What about establishing and extending contacts
with local trade unions and the trades council?
If any or all of these turn you on, the External
Affairs Committee is for you. I need a secretary
and four others, so please sign your name on the
forms now up in the Union Lower Lounge, and
get your friends to second you.
Paul Watkins,
External Affairs
Officer.
NUS CARDS
IN THE UNION OFFICE
12:45 to 1:45.
BRING : - REGISTRATION DIARY
AND SMALL PHOTOGRAPH.
This one never fails. Having
temporarily floored the opp-
osition make a tour of the
place picking out suitable
spots for an armchair you
happen to have, the rug that's
doing nothing at home and the
tv which has BBC 2. Don't be
tempted to overdo this. A
little will go a long way. While
this is all ticking away in
their little minds, leave your
card and waltz out. You're in.
Now before I get accused
of treating a serious problem
flippantly, let me say that at
the present moment our Union
is basking in its own glory
having won a major victory in
our struggle to get Union flats.
At the moment about 40% of
I.F. live in flats, 30% in
hostels and about 30% commute
from home. Obviously it is the
last category which concern
us because these are the poor
unfortunates who dash out at
4.30 a.m. to catch tubes and
trains and who are sadly
missing on the social scene.
We hope to make things easier
for them by taking p^^.the
lease of a number of flats-fdr
which the Union will be
responsible. So far we are tied
up in the legalities of the
operation, but things are
moving ahead and with a little
luck and a lot of friendly
persuasion, we might have our
flats by Christmas. Meanwhile,
if anyone comes across a few
empty rooms in Southside
desperately in need of some
lodgers, we have a few homeless
waifs down here....
