voted irrelevant
ICU UGM mas a hit pr Guilds President Ralph Greenwel after a hit sauad strike
A Motion to ban political discussions at Union General Meetings
(UGM's) was unanimously defeated at the Freshers U G M on Thursday.
The motion on relevance aimed to ban discussions on subjects which were
not directly relevant to the welfare of Students at Imperial College.
The motion was proposed by said that motions proposed by
former Union President Sydney
Harbour Bridge (name changed in
aid of Comic Relief) and seconded
by the current President, Nigel
Baker. Speaking for the motion Mr
Harbour Bridge said that
discussions of a political nature
should be limited to Clubs and
Societies. He expressecTconcern that
minority groups could pass motions
of a political nature by turning out
en masse at UGM's.
Speaking against the motion,
Overseas Studen Committee
Chairman, Amin El Kholy pointed
out that the motion ran against the
principles of freedom of speech and
minority groups could be opposed
if those in opposition also turned up
en masse to the U G M . Other
speakers suggested that the motion
would prevent discussion of issues
important to Overseas Students,
and questioned who would decide,
whether or not motions were
'relevant'.
Chris Martin commented that the
motion would effectively allow the
Governing Body of Imperial College
to dictate what was and what was
not discussed at UGM's.
The motion was taken to the vote
and defeated by an overwhelming
majority.
Rag Mag
Continued from front page.
Mr Williams told FELIX that he
had asked Mr Baker if anything was
unacceptable on Sunday afternoon
and he had said he 'didn't think so'.
Mr Williams expected to be
contacted by Mr Baker by Monday
lunchtime. Mr Baker similarly
expected to be contacted by Mr
Williams on Monday morning.
When he was not contacted, Mr
Williams sent the Rag Mag to the
printers on Monday evening.
Miss Nicholas, Rag Chairman, has
complained about a number of the
jokes in the new Rag Mag. She
objects to two items about the Kings
Cross Fire disaster and several
'jokes' about the blind and disabled.
Miss Nicholas told FELIX that she
had considered sending some of the
items to the charities supported by
this year's Rag efforts. The charities
include 'Guide dogs for the blind'.
Mr Williams has defended the Rag
Mag saying 'I'm quite positive it's
one of the best.' Fie added that he
had seen 'at least another two' Rag
Mags this year, carrying items on
the Kings Cross disaster. 'Every joke
in the Rag Mag was told to me by
IC students,' he said, 'I think it's a
reasonable representation of IC
students' sense of humour.'
The Rag Committee meeting
today will discuss the Rag Mag and
the Censorship Committee will
meet next week, to decide the fate
of the Rag Mag, which may have to
be recalled from the printers.
The Rag Mag Censorship
Committee was formed three years
ago in response to a Rag Mag,
edited by Mr Tony Spencer. The
magazine contained items on the
Bradford Fire Disaster, which
caused an uproar in the national
press.
IC Radio
goes FM
Imperial College Radio has begun
FM broadcasting trials in Southside,
making it one of only two student
stations in the country to broadcast
on FM. The station has been granted
a licence to conduct test
transmissions on 97.7 MHz by the
Department of Trade and Industry.
The station are planning to install
more speakers in Evelyn Gardens in
an effort to expand their network
and to replace existing speakers
stolen or removed over the years.
Marathon
Man
College security guard, Bob
Dickens, 51, is to run a full 26 mile
marathon in Dublin on October 31.
After a year's training he plans to
pay for his flight to Dublin and run
the marathon f(jr The Cancer
Research Fund. Anybody interested
in sponsoring Mr Dickens should

Nicked!
Chief Security Officer, Geoff
Reeves, has warned students to be
aware of cycle-thieves operating
around the College. He told FELIX
that thieves were succeeding in
cutting chains and removing
padlocks securing bicycles. He went
on to point out that more effective
padlocks are available from the
Sherfield Security Desk.
Chalmed
I'm
sure!
Mr James Chalmers retired from his <
full-time post as College Senior
Assistant Secretary last Friday. Mr
Chalmers will remain at the College
in a part-time capacity 'to help out
over the year'. At a function on
Wednesday to honour Mr
Chalmers' retirement, Mr John
Smith, College Secretary, made a
short speech and presented Mr
Chalmers with an Aaron Stones
lithograph.
Described by Mr Smith as his
'right hand man', Mr Chalmers
came to Imperial College from the
Malaysian Colonial Service over 25
years ago. His past experiences
include work in the British
Intelligence Services during the war
in the orient, and work in
commerce.
Mr Chalmers said 'I came in full
of enthusiasm' as he described the
start of his career at Imperial, and
went on to say that he has 'enjoyed
it throughout.'
New mixer
for IC
radio
Imperial College Radio have been
awarded Â£2458 by the Queensgate
trust to purchase an ex-
demonstration mixing desk. They
have been offered the mixer at half
price by Mr Alan Archer, an ex-
Electrical Engineering student now
working for Sandcroft SAC200. The
new mixer will allow separate
programmes to be transmitted on
FM and A M and has the facility for
multiple channel recording. The
mixer will probably be installed in
the Northside studio, although IC
Radio are looking into the possibility
of a studio above their existing
studio as a replacement to
Northside.
Station Manager, Nigel Whitfield
told FELIX 'It's absolutely beautiful.
If I hadn't got the money from the
Queensgate Trust I would have
been prepared to kill for that mixer.'
