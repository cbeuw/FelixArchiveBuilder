Arnold Schwarzenegger... come on down!
FILMS
The Running Man
It is 2017. The government has
problems controlling the riotous
public and in order to cater for their
bloodthirsty tendencies has
introduced Free Vee (free
television). A string of violent game
shows is the only broadcast made by
the Network. Society's fierce nature
is satisfied.
Ben Richards (Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Predator, Raw Deal,
Terminator) enters the scene. Refusal
to kill unarmed rioters has resulted
in his imprisonment. He manages
to escape but is quickly recaptured
when given away by a Network
employee he has kidnapped.
Consequently he becomes the next
contestant on one of the most
popular of the game shows, The
Running Man, fighting for his life in
gladiatorial style combat.
The fellow escapees sent in with
him and the kidnapped girl provide
Richards with his only help. The
obligatory underground movement
can only watch and wait. Their fight
is aimed at bringing down the
Network so putting an end to the
television violence which the
government uses as a smokescreen
to hide its true actions.
Good Morning Vietnam
There are few places that
Hollywood likes to take us more
regularly than Vietnam. Having
shown us all the ins and outs of
violence, death, and destruction of
innocence all the films take on the
bland similarity characterised by the
phrase 'just another war film'. So
it's nice to see something fresh.
Touchstone Pictures, the adult
subsidiary of Walt Disney Studios,
has just released Good Morning
Vietnam starring Robin Williams as
US Forces Radio DJ Adrian
Cronouer. And that is really where
the story ends. The film serves as
little more than a vehicle for
Williams' incredible talent as a
comedy actor, as he ad-libs his way
through the task of boosting morale
(it's difficult to believe he could have
followed anything other than a
ghost of a script). When Williams is
off screen the film deteriorates
noticably though it is never bad. A
touch of intrigue provided by the
involvement of a V C terrorist and
his sister, whom Cronouer is
romantically entangled with, adds
a little depth to the movie but in the
end it's still just a stage for Williams.
Superb direction, a strong cast of
fine actors, set to a wonderful
soundtrack make this one of the best
films currently showing.
Andrew Clarke.
The villian of the piece is Dan
Killian, host of The Running Man,
complete with all the falsity and
arrogance which both typifies the
presenters of game shows and
personifies the faceless beaurocracy
of government. He has the
smugness of one who knows that
nobody has ever beaten the system.
Of course, he's never seen a
Schwarzenegger movie.
When a book is transferred to the
big screen the result is inferior in
almost every case, and The Running
Man is no exception. The book is
good, the film is not. Unusually this
has nothing to do with the normal
loss of detail and depth which
adaptation imposes. Indeed the
book, by Richard Bachman (a.k.a.
Stephen King), has little detail,
having been edited down to nothing
but story in order to obtain 'the
goofy speed of a silent movie'.
The film has nothing of Richards'
wife and child though, or the
struggle to expose the government's
genocidal pollution policy. The
game show is different, its rules are
different, the arena is different, the
players are all different. Even the
major characters are different. In

short it's a different story. Not so
much a film based on a book as one
given the same name.
The reason the book triumphs
over the movie is quite simply that
its story is the better one. It has
tension and excitement, sadly
lacking in the film.
Even with the freedom of a re-
write, the chance to satirise the
mainstay of modern mass viewing
is overlooked. Instead, the only
clear statement made is the
necessity of curbing violence in
entertainment before society
develops the addiction to it
portrayed in this and so many other
films. Ironically, this is exactly
where Schwarzenegger has made
his acting career.
Ultimately we have a typical

Everything.....
Everything you always suspected
was true about advertising but were
too legal, decent and honest to ask
by Martyn Forrester, 96 pages,
Fontana (£2.95).
If you want a short evening's
entertainment you could do worse
than borrow a copy of this book, but
in my opinion, it's not worth buying
yourself. Bits of this book made me
laugh others didn't and ninety-six
pages of variably funny anecdotes
don't add up to value for money.
Part of the trouble is that it tries
too hard to be funny—most clearly
seen in the Glossary which contains
gems like 'Adaptation: Someone
else's ad modified to fit your brief.
It might sound funnier after one of
those three-hour working lunches
he mentioned.
A few themes get repetitive after
a while. Those working lunches,
women sleeping their way to the
top, women....There is definitely a
patronising attitude to women
which I couldn't quite figure out. At
times it seems tongue in cheek, at
others it's so understated that its
difficult to tell if the author is being
Schwarzenegger movie. The initial
injustice and subsequent deaths of
several friends and included as
justification for the bloody reprisals
doled out in the predictable finale.
It all appeals to your base instincts,
but it can really do little more.
If you happen to be tempted by
this form of cinema entertainment
then it remains a far more attractive
prospect than the ridiculous Rambo
III. Nevertheless, having found a
pinacle with the brilliant Predator,
Schwarzenegger has stumbled to a
low ebb with what is truely his
worst film. If you just want to see
an action movie then wait for Bruce
Willis in Die Hard, and give this one
a miss.

subtle or just plain male chauvenist.
The funniest sections are generally
quote's of other advertising people's
copy or overheard comments. My
favourites include 'To be honest, I
believe in putting all our eggs on the
table', and 'Advertising is a people's
business. So's canibalism'. The
chapter on 'Hiccups, Cockups and
Did Anyone remember to take out
insurance?' is good for a laugh.
Where he tells of favourite tricks
with words it makes quite good
reading and after the section on food
photography, food ads will never
look the same again. How does a
photographer rejuvenate a flat fizzy
drink? Just add salt. I wonder how
many people will try out his little
test: 'Simply add a spoonful of salt
to your mate's lager, then stand well
back'.
You'll find out how people have
got into the business, what top
people earn and how people get
sacked ('don't worry we're just
redecorating your office').
