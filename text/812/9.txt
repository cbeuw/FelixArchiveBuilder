Clubs
We are Here
Since there was no mention of us in
the Freshers' Fair Plan in FELIX
some of you may have been
wondering if we exist. Well we do!
We were at IC Freshers' Fair but
some of you may have missed us.
We were the ones with the Firefly
dinghy on the Queen's Lawn, just
in case you were wondering.
Anyway, here are a few facts for
you if you didn't find us: We sail at
the Welsh Harp Reservoir in
Wembley every Wednesday
afternoon where we share a
clubhouse with ULU Sailing Club.
For the first few Wednesdays a
minibus service will be run by the
Club from Southside to the Welsh
Harp, otherwise we usually meet
outside Southside at 12.30pm. Our
activities include racing, cruising
and various social events, in fact,
the first social event is this Sunday.
We are having a ploughman's lunch
at 12.30 in Southside, which is free
to members! We usually race at the
weekends against other University
sailing clubs or maybe attend an
SAILING CLUB
open meeting...Last year we even
went to BUSA. BUSA is the annual
race meeting of the British
University Sailing Clubs.
However, if you don't like racing,
you can cruise, and if you don't
have any experience of sailing, don't
worry, we'll help you. If you want
to learn to crew or helm our more
experienced helms will teach you.
Every Tuesday between 12.30 and
1.30pm we have 'Guinness and
Gossip', this is a friendly meeting
where we discuss^sailing for the
following week. So if you're
interested come along.
Hello to St Mary's and welcome,
ICSC is for you as well, so if you
didn't see us at St Mary's Freshers'
Fair why not come along on
Tuesday. If you can't make that
then just send a line to our Captain
Bill Chard, IC Physics 2.
If you're interested in sailing why
not turn up on Sunday and have a
chat.
Out on the Town
GLC
The Greater London Club is in
essence a social club which
organises events that cater for all
tastes. Many of the events are
unique to London. Last year's trips
included Jongleurs in the Coronet
Cabaret Club, Wogan, The Old
Bailey, The City, greyhound racing,
a casino, the fringe theatre and
several bands. The most popular
events had limited numbers and as
a result were repeated.
This year will include a trip to see
the Daily Telegraph and this will
cover the whole production process.
We will also visit Ronnie Scott's and
there will be visits to various bands
(jazz, blues, rock n roll) throughout
the year. Last year's City visits
covered the Stock Exchange, Lloyds
of London and the Bank of England.
This year's visits are likely to be
along the same lines. 'Alternative'
events include the Greyhound
'church' session and a Parisienne
cabaret called Madame Jojo's.
All events will be excellent value
due to the heavy subsidies and
group, reductions. If any of these
events interest you then I strongly
advise the investment in a
membership of the Greater London
Club.
fiddling your Winks
Or is it winking your tiddles? This
is an experience not to be missed.
Imagine yourself...collecting can
and winks in hand...extracting
money from stupefied tourists and
shoppers along Oxford Street.
Saturday will start at 10am when
all tiddlers go and get registered at
their respective C C U offices. At
about Ham all collectors will walk
to Marble Arch. RCS will begin
collecting at once whilst Guilds and
Mines catch the tube to Tottenham
Court Road. At about 1pm there will
be the traditional Ring-a-Ring-o'
Roses around the statue of Eros
followed by a quick one in the
Cockney Pride public house.
The collection is for a charity
called Action A i d who fund
development programmes in the
Third World. Those raising the most
money will be rewarded with prizes
of champagne.
See you there.
