Pure Malt-The
Traditional Way
As I am a Chemical Engineer, I
thought I would start the year by
acquainting you with one of the
more interesting chemical processes
to be found, which I saw during a
recent visit to Scotland—that is the
production of Whisky. I visited the
Glenfiddich Distillery in Dufftown,
which has been owned and
managed by the Grant family since
1887; the final product then was so
good that the process has remained
largely unchanged since, for fear of
making it worse. The traditional
process is reflected in the price-
about £13 a bottle, but nevertheless
they sell as much as they can
produce.
The first process is in the Mash
House where the two essential
ingredients are mixed together-
malted barley, ground to a powder
called grist is mixed with Highland
spring water. When heated, the
water dissolves the sugars out of the
grist producing a sugary liquid
called wort. This is then passed to
the Tun Room where yeast is added
and the liquid fermented to produce
a wash which resembles a beer.
This wash is then passed to the
Stillhouse. Glenfiddich is distilled
twice in traditionally shaped copper
stills which are built and maintained
by their own coppersmiths. The
stills are unusually small, but
despite increased demand, they
refuse to change the size or shape.
The distillation is controlled by the
stillman who selects the fine 'middle
cut' for maturation; the rest is
recycled. The process from the
Stillroom onwards is under strict
control of the Customs and Excise
people; the spirit side is completely
sealed.
At this stage the spirit is
practically colourless and tasteless,
and cannot legally be called whisky
until it has matured for at least three
years. Glenfiddich is matured for at
least eight years. Maturation takes
place in oak casks; unlike wines,
once whisky is bottled it changes
very little. Some whisky is matured
in new oak casks, some in old casks,
and some in casks from Spain which
have been used previously for
sherry. These three are mixed
according to an exact formula to
obtain the required taste and colour
of the final product. The maturation
takes place in the bonded
warehouses, which have two locks,
one key held at the Distillery and the
other by Customs. This is to avoid
having to pay duty until the whisky
is ready for sale; with 55 million
litres in the warehouses this would
otherwise mean an enormous
amount of money tied up.
During the maturation, some 10%
of the original volume is lost, and
this figure increases if the
maturation is longer. The matured
whisky, however, is far stronger
than necessary, and is therefore
diluted with the right amount of
spring water to give either 40%
alcohol for the UK or 43% for export
(Yes, 'Duty Free' whisky is stronger
than the full price variety). This is
then passed to the bottling plant
where the 75cl size bottles are filled
by automated machine. Other sizes
are done 'by hand', but all under
the watchful eye of H M Customs!
The final part of the visit was a
sample of the product, which lived
up to its reputation and did justice
to the care put into its manufacture.
Wine Fingerprints
Scientists at the French company
Eurofins, based in Nantes, have
developed a method of taking a
distinctive 'fingerprint' of a wine, to
pinpoint its vintage and vineyard
with the accuracy of a connoisseur.
They use a technique known as
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
which measures the wine's
composition in terms of isotopes of
four elements, hydrogen, oxygen,
carbon and nitrogen. The different
ratios of these elements stamp each
wine with a unique isotopic
fingerprint. Eurofins have built up
a data bank of known samples
which allows wines to be instantly
identified.
From a small sample the NMR
method can be used to check
whether a wine has been diluted or
adulterated; the method was
initially used to detect the practice
of adding sugar to the grape 'must'
during fermentation, enabling the
scientists to show that the majority
of beaujolais wines had too much
sugar added. The method has been
endorsed as the official EEC method
of checking wine quality.
Help!!

Waller, Andrea (sorry I've forgotten your last name), Michael Dalton, Andy Clarke,

thanks to Kura, Gwyn Jones, Andy Latham, Peter Wainwright, Paul Orrow-Whiting,
Amy Sumner, Paul Bishop, Demetrios Biskinis, Andrew Avery, Jane Gray, Adrian
Topham and all the people who helped collate last week's FELIX. You're all wonderful.
FELIX needs help with compiling
news and stories for this page, if it
is to be interesting to more people
than just myself. If there is a subject
that you would particularly like to
read about, then please tell me; even
better, provide me with a source of
information or a written article. Also
if there are any PGs or members of
staff out there who would like
FELIX readers to know what they
are doing, let me know so that it can
be read here before it gets into the
New Scientist. I can be contacted via
FELIX or, better still, the Chem Eng
pigeonholes.
