Music
Hymn From A Village
Marquee, Fruit Bats, The Bible
They have done two things at the
new Marquee Qub; firstly it creates
the impression of being almost as
small as the previous venue (wide
angle lenses required to avoid
annoying columns) and secondly
they have managed to convert a
cinema into something which looks
exactly like a converted cinema. The
two groups tonight were not helped
by a terrible sound set up either.
I arrived just into the set of the
Fruit Bats to discover a Janice Long
clone singing lead (minus baby).
She didn't quite have the hang of
the between song quips but at least
her relatives were there to cheer her
on. Her obtrusive manner detracted
from the actual music. The music
was quite punchy in parts with a
bass that occasionally came through
and made you ask the person next
to you '...what's this one?'. The
songs we were supposed to know
('...and I think you all know this
one, let's go!' etc.) were dull with
an indie-jangle lilt. They conned an .
encore by pretending to forget
which was their last song. Obscurity
or bust.
The Bible are strictly New
Testament, the same vague story
repeated four times with some
interesting parts tacked onto the
end. This five man band do a good'
impression of American mid-west
soft rock all rolled up in a British-
indie package. You get the feeling
they are not inspired by anything
but simply know how to right
songs, and it is only inspiration that
breeds originality. To be fair they
got a deservedly good reception
from a crowd obviously more
familiar than I am with their music.
There were no gems here only the
semi-precious such as King Chicago,
which benefitted from the
introduction of a saxophone,
Cigarette Girls and something with
Shake in the title.
The gig seemed to drift along
formlessly with a slight uplift at^he
end of The Bible. Personally I'd
prefer to stay at home and read the
original.
James-Strip Mine
Sometimes I think James have only
one song. I put on this album and
the round, regular drum beat draws
_my attention, then the jangly
unobtrusive guitar entices me into
the tune to be comforted by the
smooth bass. As soon as I'm
comfortable in the tune Tim Booth's
clear, staccato vocals start to play
with my mind. The tracks, although
different in beat and tone, are
unmistakably James and the more I
listen, the more indiscernable they
become.
I am reminded of their previous
alubim Stutter which posessed the
same qualities, the same lilt. Is this
still the same song?
Then I realise that .tyith James all
is understatement, persuasion
rather than force, they invite you to
listen and if works. A few tracks
stand out from the already excellent
field such as Not There which is
touching when you realise what it
is about, the initial What For and the
final musical Refrain which is the
epitome of James.
The same song, maybe but still a
good one.v.
Robert Palmer-Hammersmith
Odeon
Palmer is an artist, and acts
accordingly. Not for him the
exhuberance of a Rock Star, using
the crowd to boost his ego. He did
not leap energentically around the
stage thursting his pelvis at us but
strolled to the front seemingly
oblivious of the music to which he
was introduced. He was dressed not
in a gold lame "suit or leather
trousers but a sober grey suit, very
understated and probably very
expensive.
Heretq,sing, his silky growl suits
all of his eclectic stylesfromthe hard
rock of §ome Like it Hot and
Hyperactive To the cocktail bar
ambience of Riptide and Dreams.
Much of his current album Heavy
Nova was showcased, interspersed
with the best of the rest; Johnny &
Mary, Searching For Clues, Doctor
Doctor and more. He spoke to us
only to introduce the band, all
seasoned musicians who knew their
place, behind him, and the backing
singer who ob' usly knew how to
kick ass, and cud so when Palmer
retired to remove his jacket.
This was not a show to get carried
away at and it was a shame to see
the Odeon staff preventing people
from dancing. The show was good,
despite the lack of an encore which
seemed unplanned as it took a while
for the lights to come up. Perhaps
he had started to sweat? After all it
must have been hot out here and the
man is an artist and not a pop star!
Singles-1.10.88
Julia Fordham is a 'Woman of the
Eighties' or at least her current
single is but it does not show off the
talent her record company obviously
thinks she has. She preaches
uncomplicated independence to a
light funky beat, and whilst the
sound is clean it is essentially
forgettable despite the four
producers who worked on it.
A similar lush production is
evident on Helleluiah Man by Love &
Money. I don't forsee massive
radioplay or succes for this offering
but if they can perform as well as
this live then they would be well
worth checking out.
The Lilac Time are the new band
of Stephen 'Tintin' Duffy.
Unfortunately the rustic pop of
You 've Got to Love is unlikely to make
them a million but it is quite the
most attractive single I've heard in
ages. This record is folk music of the
eighties (and for the nineties) and I
love the wit that inspired the
Majvern Mix on the 12*.
The Go-Betweens-Mean Fiddler
Maybe it's the lighting, maybe it's
the atmosphere or perhaps it is just
me but whenever I go to the
Harlesden Mean Fiddler I think I
recognise people. The place is
teeming with people I know when
seen out of the comer of my eye but
who metamorphose into someone
else when I turn and look.
Distracting. The venerable Mean
Fiddler has been extended to
include two more bars making a
total of four in the small main
venue; overkill or shrewd move?
To pay £6 for a main band with no
support is excessive however good
they are supposed to be. You start •
'to wonder where the money went,
it certainly didn't go on improving
the Fiddler's PA system which
sounds like an earthquake at the
front. Move back and you can find
a reasonable compromise.
The Go-Betweens came on at
10.45pm after a suitably long wait
watching roadies bring out IV2
guitars per hour, (why are they so
slow?). The GBs are a curious
looking group. There are two
guitarist/lead singers; one looks like
Bob Hoskins the other is tall,
scraggy and stoney faced. The
bassist is an odd lizard-man but
likeable. There is an innocent, coy
country gal on violin and a
drummer hidden by her drums.
They played a fairly long set
which consisted mostly of songs
about , towns in northern
Queensland where they used to live
(one each persumably), and friends
of theirs: Clarke Sisters, Karen (I
suppose there is little else to write
about in Australia). They did not
come across well musically; the
singing (especially Bob's) was
frequently out of (or void of) tune.
Guitar was scratchy when it should
have been full and the whole sound
did not carry. The otherwise
excellent Streets of my Town was
spoiled by the amateur sound.
The gig was enjpyable though,
perhaps it was the vaguely chaotic
'garage' sound and the quirky
character of the band because it
wasn't the music, on this occasion.
The last encore, Karen was ruined
for me by the two people in fromjcf
me. They pushed in then said
is better' and proceeded to dal
like epileptic dough hooks. Who]
these people?
