The 3 litre Capri sat beside the red
light, the front wheels touching the
white line, black tarmac stretching
out ahead of the car, engine revving
almost to the redline. The green
light glowed, and instantly the car
leapt forward. The extra wide (9
inch) rear tyres spun with a shriek
which lasted half a second, blue tyre
smoke drifting out of the wheel
arches, then the tyres gripped. The
driver let the car reach 30 mph
before hitting second gear, and the
car reached 50 mph in under 7
seconds from when the lights had
changed, at which point the driver
eased off in case there were any
police around.
Meanwhile, at Santa Pod drag
strip some serious racing was about
to take place, as two cars lined up
for the top fuel dragster final. The
light alloy V8 engines made a noise
like gunfire through 16 unsilenced
exhausts as the drivers (both
women) inched their cars up to the
start, line. The bicycle sized front
tyres touched the line, and a steady
orange light lit up indicating the
fact. Another light came on and as
the three enormous (4 inch
diameter) throttles flipped wide
open on the top of each engine, the
green light glowed. Both cars leapt
forward. The extra wide (18 inch)
large diameter, extra soft compound
racing slick rear tyres on the car,
driven by Monica Oberg, spun
easily with a sound totally drowned
by the unbelievable blast of noise
from the engines. This is a mistake
which wastes power and usually
spells defeat for the driver
concerned, but a worse fate befell
Miss Berstade, driving the other car,
as something vital (and probably
very expensive) broke in the
transmission and put her out of the
race, leaving her car c

rubber behind th
before they a. ally
passed the q. arter
after, at a speed of a
time that had elapsed since the
lights changed? Just 6.8 seconds.
This 'race' was the most
spectacular of the day, largely
because drivers try to avoid
wheelspins, especially 300 yard
ones. To give you an idea of how
much power was wasted in
vapourising rubber, the fastest time
was set by a man called Gary Page
in a similar, though theoretically
slower car. He managed ,0 to 224
mph in 5.94 seconds, which is 0.01
seconds outside the European
record.
There were, in fact, 13 classes of
car. Fastest are the fuel cars, the
name refers to the liquid explosive
nitro-methane fuel that the cars
burn, whose engines are usually 8
litres capacity, high pressure
supercharged, and made of
inexpensive materials such as alloys
j m d
ion, at
Sns per*1
second (not ajlmissprint) is not
exactly modest, but then neither is
the power output, at 2500 or more
brake horsepower for the really
competitive cars. This gives an
intersting power to weight ratio, as
the fuel cars have more power than
an Intercity 125 locomotive but
weigh less than a mini metro...Fuel
cars come in three shapes—long and
narrow—top fuel dragsters; car
shaped, with fibre glass body; funny
cars; and fuel altered (like the funny
cars but with less bodywork).
Slower, but still fast (eg 0-170 in
under 8 seconds) are the pro-
competition cars and the dragsters.
These are also long, narrow and
rear-engined, but typically may only
have 1000-1500 horsepower for the
pro-comp, and even less for the
dragsters.

boring end of this spectrum were
the production (no modifications
allowed) cars. Next comes super
street, pro stock, modified, roadster
and super gas. Super gas is the
interesting end of this spectrum and
the fastest car in this class was a
Cosworth Sierra driven by Geoff
Houser. Apart from the giant rear,
tyres and a large air intake on the
bonnet this car looks standard, but
as soon as the light went green, it
became pretty obvious that the
engine was not the Ford Cosworth
item (in fact it was a 7.2 litre
Chrysler engine). The giveaway
came in that not only did the front
wheels lift clear off the ground, but
one of them lifted about 8 inches
higher than the other as a result of
the chassis twisting under the
tremendous power of the engine.
The car managed a time of 8.11
seconds at a terminal speed of 176
» p h , which is not only a lot quicker
H\an a standard Sierra by a wide
margin, it would also leave a
formula one grand prix car standing.
Well, that about covers half of the
action. What! You say, more cars?
No! Motorbikes.
Take a road bike of lOOOcc or more
(1300cc is pretty popular), soup it up
so it is even faster than a standard
1300cc Suzuki and you can
accidentally pull wheelies while
leaning forward on the petrol tank
aM^khat have you got? That's
a contender for the slowest
class of drag racing motorbike.
In order to go faster than this, the
bikes get longer and lower, and back
tyres get fatter and fatter; the
engines get bigger and steel bars
with little wheels on the end are
attached to the back of the bike to
limit wheeliesto a few inches. This
modification is t.' avoid the

Tarmac Trevor could hardly be
called the slowest. One funny bike
managed to complete the quarter
mile in 8 seconds, reaching 170mph
without touching the front wheel on
the ground (the wheel was rotating
backward in the slipstream as the
bike crossed the finish line). When
I asked how the rider had managed
to steer, I received the reply 'by the
seat of his pants'. This is literally
true, as the riders control the
shaking progress of these
superbikes by hanging over the side
of the bikes to keep them on course!
The funny bikes have approximately
the same power output as a
Lamborghini Countach, but they are
not the fastest type of bike. This
accolade belongs to the top class of
competition bikes—supercharged,
nitromethane burning 1.5 litre
550-600 bhp monsters. The rear
tyres are over a foot wide, the rider
lies down on top of the bike above
the engine. The world record in this
class is currently held by an
Englishman called Rod Pallant who
managed 0-220 mph in 7.54 seconds
a few months ago (which smashed
the previous record of 199 mph). At
Santa Pod this time, his bike blew
a head gasket, which caused 18 inch:
flames to shoot out of the side of the
engine and terminally damaged the
cylinder head and block of the
engine.
Fastest competition bike titlej
therefore, fell to Philip Brachtrogel,
riding a bike called Quarter
Scorcher, which managed 0-190
mph in 7.6 seconds, and in my mind
at least, came close to the noisiest;
bike prize, .sounding rather likej
multiple machineguns to my ears.
In addition to all this, you also
have jet and rocket cars to add to the
spectacle, which is well worth going
to see. Mere facts and figures can't
convey the excitement of going to
see the world's fastest accelerating
cars, though a shower of rain can
stop all the action.
I think I'll close with a quote from
one Sammy Millar, driver of a rocket
car called 'Vanishing Point', which
can accelerate 0-100 mph in 33 feet':,
