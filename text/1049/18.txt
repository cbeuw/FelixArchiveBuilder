RCS Union
The Royal College of Science Union has
moved office, and can now be found at Civ
Eng! Odd? Well it's a... umm... cosy,
modern office, more accessible to all
students. The Office will be open every
lunchtime, and possibly more often - it's
situated in Unwin Road, just off the
Imperial College Road opposite the Science
Museum schools' entrance; or if you are
standing on the Sherfield walkway outside
the Royal School of Mines then you have to
go down the stairs towards the Dalby Court
Lawn - you will see RCS Crowns showing
the way. We are here for your academic,
social and welfare needs - and anything else
you want us to do - use your Union, and
make the most of it. We are here for you!
The R C S U want to receive feedback
from students and others about their
concerns in college, about the R C S U and
anything else. Mark your comments for
attention of Rob Park, and deliver into the
R C S U pigeon hole in I C U office in Beit
Quad. Cheers.

S + G Trip to the
Lake District
After a cramped six hour iourney,
sixteen of us arrived at Ashness to discover
that our accommodation was to be in a hut
with no water or electricity supply, and it was
a five mile walk to the nearest pub. You
should ask yourself the question, WHY ??
If you were to have asked this question
you would probably have got sixteen
different answers.
Saturday morning saw six of us standing
at the bottom of a frozen ice fall known as
Sour-milk gill fit looked as though someone
had poured curdled milk over the hillside.).
My first day of ice climbing went quite well
despite falling up to my nether regions in ice
cold water five minutes after the start. We
had a most enjoyable day hacking away at
what were quite elegant ice formations
before we found them.
Saturday night was the usual night of
drunken excess and guitar playing -
Strawberry Fields Forever. Sunday morning
and it was back to the ice again, this time it
was the turn of Chris to get spectacularly
wet. After falling into a pool of water up to
his bellybutton he was then dragged out onto
another sheet of ice that subsequently broke
leaving a two - three metre pool of water
between us and the only way up. Nice one
Chris!
After bravely forging ahead though we
descended to the valley and felt the need to
sample the local brew before packing up to
head back to London.
