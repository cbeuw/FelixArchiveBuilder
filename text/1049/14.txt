Have you ever been tempted to try the
Broadwalk Ballet? This is the common term
used to denote that trendy set of people with
wheels strapped to their feet who display
their enviable skills on In-Line Skates (Roller
Blades - like Hoover) on Kensington
Gardens' Broadwalk next to Kensington
Palace.
If yon are one of the addicted, planning
on getting hooked soon or indeed if you are a
skateophobe, then you should know a few
things about the London Skating scene. 1993
saw the first converts with a handful of in-
line skaters meeting on summer days in
Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, playing
frisbee on wheels and sunbathing on the
grass. One year later there were hundreds of
practitioners and the sunbathing spots
became limited. The popular circuit of the
parks resembled Knightsbridge during the
Harrods Sale. Complaints of wheelbound
traffic interfering with the pleasures of a
Sunday stroll began to pour in to the Royal
Parks Constabulary. The main plaintiffs were
from that group of citizens who can still
remember Prince Albert, and various
antedeluvian dog-walkers. The press seized
on this newly topical recreation as a good way
of selling papers, by highlighting and playing
up the various conflicts between those on
wheels and those who were more narrow
minded. Bad show old chap - just not cricket,
eh what? The public view formed by the
media's presentation of skaters as speed
freaks and selfish good-for-nothings meant
that skating inevitably received a bad rep. A n
accident in 1995 which resulted in the death
of a cyclist gave the press a field day. The sto-
ries they wrote bore little relation to the
facts; headlines stated "Cyclist killed by
blader". Something that still holds currency.
The papers ran this story and referred back to
it for months, but gave very little coverage
much later when the inquest was held and
the skater was exonerated in view of the fact
that he wasn't really moving and may as well
have been wearing shoes. This accident
together with one or two others have given
skaters a bad reputation. The fact is that
skating has a lower accident rate than rid-
ing, cycling, skiing and snow-boarding and
is probably more fun.
Fed up with the unfair perception of
skaters, a group got together in 1994, to

Who makes the decisions!
•
The Parks Watch is a meeting held every few months help to decide on Park Policy. It is hosted by
the Royal Parks Constabulary and attended by a representative of the Royal Parks Agency, and par-
ticularly by those who like to complain about things to do with Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park.
The meeting is not just about skating, but passions surface when skating is the next topic on
the agenda and those who are vehemently against skaters are all present and correct and ready to
vote. Skaters and, indeed, non-skaters who feel that injustice abounds in the Royal Parks should
attend these meetings to even out the votes that influence Park policy; the future of skating in the
parks depends partly on you. It. is only the few that want skating confined to the streets. If you are
interested in attend-
ing (next meeting
23rd Feb) or would
like to express your
opinion on the mat-
ter please contact
Alex Cinelli ASAP.

try and encourage more thoughtfulness by
skaters towards slower moving objects. They
formed EISA; Britain's In-Line Skating
Association. They produced the "Skate Wise"
code of conduct and offered membership
which included £1 million public liability
insurance, a magazine and discounts on safety
gear in the shops. That was just to seduce the
skaters into joining - the real core purpose
was to create a unified voice for skaters, to
provide information such as how people
could find an instructor, and to promote the
safe use of park areas for all participants - the
goal of the Skate Patrol.
BISA Skate patrollers (see below) do not
ticket skaters or pull them from the trails,
rather they monitor areas to make everyone's
recreation more enjoyable by making skaters
aware of park etiquette and ordinances. They

Origins of in-line
Skating
•
The first in-line skate was developed in the early
1 700s by a Dutchman who wanted to practice ice
skating in the summer by nailing wooden spools
to strips of wood and attaching them to his shoes.
The next version appeared in 1 760 when a
London instrument maker, Joseph Merlin, decided
to make an entrance to a masquerade parry by
skating in on metal-wheeled boots while playing a
violin. He ended up skating into a huge mirror at
the end of the ballroom, not having learned to
stop or steer.
In 1823, Robert John Tyers of London
designed a skate called a "rolito" by placing five
wheels in a row on the bottom of a shoe. The
rolito was not take seriously at the time.
In 1863 an American, James Plimpton,
found a way to make a workable skate. He came
up with a four-wheel skate with two pairs of
wheels side by side, and so the modern four-
wheel roller skate was created. Roller skates
allowed turns, and also forwards and backwards
skating. The invention of ball bearing wheels in
1884 helped the sport even more.
Tyers' design did not go entirely unnoticed
however. In the Netherlands, after the canals had
melted, "skeelers" (5's) were used as a means of
dry-land training, competition and transportation
for over two decades.
Finally, in 1980, when two brothers from
Minneapolis were rummaging through a pile of
equipment at a sporting goods store, they found
an old in-line skate. Scott and Brennan Olson
were ice hockey players and so they realized the
cross-training potential of the in-line skate.
They redesigned the skate using a hockey
boot, polyurethane wheels and adding a rubber
heel brake, and found they could skate as they did
on ice. Soon after, they began selling skates out of
their home and eventually Rollerblade Inc. was
born.
The rest is history.

BISA speaks for its mem-
bers and has been involved in
numerous meetings with the
Royal Parks Agency (RPA)
which wanted to put a blanket
ban on all Royal Parks. BISA
negotiated the deal skaters have
now (see map, below & left).
Skaters have been on a six
month probation since the 11th
of October, pending review and
still liable to a complete ban. So
skaters must all be well-behaved
angels if they want to carry on
skating in London's Parks. BISA
has also negotiated the use of
the area by the Albert Memorial
for playing roller hockey and an
area for slalom (and have pro-
vided nets and cones). Isn't that
nice of them! G o and try them
out, they are loads of fun.
There are some other places
to skate in London. Have you
ever tried the steps behind the
Albert Hall or Trafalgar Square?
The Southbank Centre has a few
surprises awaiting you as well.
Good learning steps are to be
found at the forecourt of
Imperial College, on Exhibition
Road.

Skate to Fitness
•
The faster you in-line skate, the higher your aerobic
requirement. In-line skating generally delivers an
aerobic work-out more beneficial than cycling, but
less so than running. This is due to the fact that
cyclists and skaters can coast but runners can't!
Unlike cycling, skating develops hamstring
muscles and provides a much better anaerobic work
out than running which will therefore improve the
overall aerobic capacity. Also, as well as developing
muscular strength and endurance in the lower
body, skating will improve balance and co-ordina-
tion.

Skating is healthy, fun and a good way to meet peo-
ple of the opposite sex (of the toned and healthy
good-looking variety), fast or slow, as you like it.
There are stunts to be done, tricks to be learned,
ramps to be catapulted from, hockey to be played,
slaloms to snake through, streetskates at night for
the adventurous and dance nights for the brave.
The Imperial College Skating Club offers these
opportunities and much much more. If you would
like to get started or participate in any of the above
activities, if you have any questions or would sim-
ply like to meet the tall, toned, healthy and good-
looking(!) Captain of the Club, do not hesitate to
contact Alex Cinelli, Aero U G III
