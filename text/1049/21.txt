Dear Felix,
The Imperial College Radio
Modellers club usually spends it's
time flying helicopters, crashing
planes and racing cars.
Unfortunately we are a hit lack-
ing in the membership depart-
ment this year but are sure that
there are many of you out .there
who mav be interested in the
club. The aim ol the club is to
bring this sometimes expensive
hobby to the mere student by let-
ting you use our 1000s ol pounds
of equipment instead ol having to
buy your own.
We are a well established
club (believe it or not) who have
been operating successfully for
several years but recently our
instructor has left us lor a
woman! This has put us in a bit of
a fix since the current members
cannot fly but want to learn! We
are therefore in search of people
who can fly, and people who
can't fly, radio controlled aero-
planes and helicopters. We have a
Morley Maverick helicopter, 3
training aircraft, one low wing
trainer and an Extra 230 stunt
plane. We also have a couple of
Schumacher Storm racing cars
and a couple of Mardave petrol
cars.
In short we're asking for peo-
ple who want to find out more
about the club and people who
can teach us to fly. You can con-
tact us by email at
ree.radio@ic.ac.uk or come along
to one of our weekly meetings at
the Mech Eng student workshop
(room 393) on Tuesdays from
5:30pm. You can also reach us by
leaving a message in our R C C
pigeon hole in the Union.
many thanks,
IC Radio Modellers

Dear Editor,
E N T R A N C E OR TOP-UP FEES
May I make a small but sig-
nificant correction to the report
on page 4 of Felix for 2nd
February? At the beginning of my
answer to the question at the
Academic Affairs meeting, I
stressed that both ideas were at
present proposals within the
C V C P system and had not been
considered by the proper College
bodies; therefore an"official line"
within the College does not exist.
What I am correctly reported in
the rest of the article (after the
first two paragraphs) as saying is
my estimate ofcurrent thinking in
the College.
Yours sincerely,
Alan Swanson
Pro Rector, Educational
Quality
It seems remarkable that
there is no official line from
Imperial on this emotive and
controversial issue. The Rector
himself has in the past been fair-
ly open in his disapproval of the
stance taken by the C V C P , so
it's seems odd that we shouldn't
have the IC position on student
funding made clear. I appreciate
that the future of government
policy on the subject is decided-
ly uncertain, but surely the
'proper college bodies' should
consider the various options and
take a stand on the issue?
