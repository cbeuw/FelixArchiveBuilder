gig: skunk anansie +
l o n g p i g S i a n
Playing to a packed audience who were waiting to
see Skunk Anansie, Longpigs were a revelation.
They are probably among the few indie bands
that take the time to try and include backing
vocals and brilliant melodies in their songs. Instead
of replaying four or five basic guitar chords and
yelling their head off, they showed variations in
their short but sweet set. Their striking lead singer
faltered at the begirrning of new single, 'Far', but
by the end ofthe song they had more than made
up for it, especially with lyrics about being stoned
and falling in love that seemed to go together hand
in hand.
Going through a set that included 'She Said'
and 'Elvis', Longpigs made the opening band,
Scthum, sound plain ordinary by comparison.
The only complaints I had were that they had a
tendency to end their songs rather too abruptly
and that their set was simply too short. But these
are only trivial points. Forget bands like
Menswear. At this rate, Longpigs will be big this
Skunk Anansie had the crowd going before
they even came on. Skin uses songs like scripts in
a movie. Rage, anger, hurt and T don't give a
damn' attitudes exploded on stage when she sang.
She seemed lost between songs, repeatedly mut-
tering 'yeah, yeah' over and over again in an
attempt to recover the atmosphere of their songs.
She has a brilliant voice sorely lacking in many
bands as anyone lucky enough to catch the first
White Room programme of the season will attest
to .
The crowd went completely wild when the
current single Weak' came on. Only Skin could
have carried of a song that had so much hurt and
anger contained by pride without sounding naive.
Only Skin would probably stage dive with a mike
in hand and get back on in time for her vocal parts.
But Skunk Anansie
aren't a one-woman
band. Their lead gui-
tarist is one of the best
around. He was always
on the brink of descend-
ing into total chaos but
never lost control.
Guitar rifts were loud,
clear and full of ferocity.
Critics have been slagging off Skunk Anansie
for their seemingly never ending political and
social agenda. Forget all that. That's for album
reviews. Skunk Anansie played such a brilliant gig
that those 'words of wisdom' will be the last thing
on your mind. A guy I met there said he would
travel the length and breadth of the country to see
them play. Now I know why.
interview: cast, „„,
John Power knows a little bit about fame. The
eponymous LP by his previous band, The La's,
inspired Noel Gallagher oi Oasis to start writing
songs while the single, 'There She Goes' was
arguably the most memorable of the late '80s
indie scene. Now, with his new band Cast, he
seems all the more ready to take his share oi the
fame he leels is so obviously due to him.
"Now we're established and playing together
all the time, even when we have an off day, we're
still brilliant. And il we play brilliantly, the rool
will rise, man. Without blowing our own thingy,
' this band are great live."
I ask Power what his plans arefor'96.
'At the end of the month we're off to Japan
and America. After that, probably in the Spring,
we'll be recording the new album. I've written the
album and I'd like to get it released some time this
year - Autumn maybe. But first we're going to re-
record 'Walk Away' (from the debut album, All
Change') and release it as the last singel from All
Change'. I'm going to remix it with loads of strings
an' that."
Having done the music questions we then
move on to juicier ones. When was the last time
he broke the law?

"Probably every night, mate. We were put in
jail in France last year. I don't know exactly what
happened -1 was totally innocent - but apparent-
ly one of the people we was (sic) with made some
kind of home-made scud missile and blew up our
hotel room. Me and the drummer spent fifteen
hours in jail."
Most impressive sir. Maybe we should return
to music. What do you think to the new crop of
British musicians?
"There's till loads of awful bands out there.,
but there's a couple of good ones like Oasis and
Black Grape who make the whole thing worth-
while. There's a lot of hype going round but the
bands who've got something worth showing -
they'll be around when the hype has run out for
the other bands."
And Power clearly thinks that his band is one
of those who do have something worth showing if
his tip for who will be the 'next big thing' in the
next few years is anything to go by:
"Cast! I don't know. I mean, we got it togeth-
er in eight months, so who knows what's around
the comer? I have seen a lot of energetic young
bands but at the end of the day it comes down to
the music. You've got to remember why you're
up there."
