Two brothers: one law abiding and the other a
street level drug dealer, and one dead man.
Detectives Klein and Mazilli (Harvey Keitel and
John Turturro), are placed in charge of the case
of the dead drug dealer. Strike Dunham (Mekhi
Phifer), a rival dealer, becomes a suspect while
his brother Victor (Isaiah Washington) confesses
to the killing. Klein believes the Victor is pro-
tecting his younger brother, presuming that no
one would convict a hard-working family man
with no prior record on a confession of self
defence. Klein is over zealous and hounds Strike,
trying to get the tnrth, convinced that he is the
murderer.
'Clockers' are the lowest level of drug deal-
ers, selling from benches, on the streets night and
day, round the clock. The film not only portrays
drug dealers and policemen, but also those trying
to escape the vicious circle of drugs, and children
who see the clockers as role models. The roles of
the homicide detectives (Keitel and Turturro)
are purely secondary to this film. Director Spike
Lee concentrates on Strike's predicament as he
becomes a catalyst for a series of damaging
events set up by Klein. He will either end up
murdered by a his king-pin boss, Delroy Iindo,
or he will wind up in jail.
There are many vivid images in Clockers,
the most notable ones coming from the begin-
ning credits, which show what appear to be
police photographs of various anonymous bodies
with gunshot wounds. Another memorable
sequence portrays a young boy, Strikes prodigy,
shooting one of Lindo's lieutenants after being
inspired by a computer game.
You can always depend on an excellent
piece of work from Spike Lee, but in Clockers
the emphasis seems to wander awayfromthe
initial murder and heading more toward the
social implications of living in a project. For the
most part this is not a problem - all the charac-
ters have been steered away from the usual
stereotypes. "It would be a fallacy to say eve
one in the projects is on dope, or pregnant at
We wanted to show the humanity that the
ple have - and it's something that you migh
necessarily see looking at the six o'clock new
Lee.
Clockers is a heavy and intellectualfilm,but
also relies on its shocking images. Its ending is
somewhat unpredictable and was a welcome
change from what I thought would happen.
theatre: dead guilty
Hardly new to the West End, this production
has been playing since October and the initial
mid-January close has just recently been extend-
ed to 16th March. So with the cast including
Hayley Mills (Chitty Chitty Bang Bang fame)
and Jenny Seagrove and reviews such as
'Impeccable' and Magnificent' from the Times,
things were looking promising for this thriller.
Surprisingly for such build up the
Wednesday night performance was barely half
full, even with many of the audience clutching
blue and red half-price tickets, but still I eagerly
anticipated the curtain-up. On opening we were
told of a car crash, the driver had suffered a heart
attack at the wheel and died, and the passenger
(Seagrove) was left with a severe leg injury. The
victims Georgian house in SW6 is the setting for
the remainder of the play, where we are intro-
duced to her visitors, the man 'who does', a
counsellor and the wife of the deceased (Mills).
The script is very pedestrian for a thriller and it
is not until the end of the first half is there any
inkling of the suspicious event we should be con-
cerned with.
It may have been better if I hadn't found
Jenny Seagroves' performance quite so irritating.
She had mastered the act of afrustratedand
despairing invalid, but three months into this pro-
duction she still had not learnt to limp convinc-
ingly, and any change in her emotion (rage
through to dejection) just involved the throwing
of her hands in the air. Mills just about saves the
day as the middle aged widow whose life revolves
around baking cakes and having chats over nice
cups of teas, but is unable to make the plot con-
vincing. The outcome is highly predictable, when
it eventually arrives and the verdict, if this was a
film it would have gone straight to video.
