It was a delightful end to the
week to have a couple of
pissed blokes fall through the
ceiling as we were finishing
putting together Felix last
week. Still, mustn't grumble:
it was all a bit of a revelation.
Apart from anything else,
I had the rather uplifting
experience of suddenly dis-
covering that some ol IC
security staff are really nice,
helpful people. Not much of
a job, having to deal with irri-
tating drunk students at
ungodly hours of the morn-
ing. Especially that sort
whomistake stupidity for
'having a bit of a laugh'. It
must take a remarkable act of
patience to sit them down
with cups of tea and be pater-
nal. And I certainly wouldn't
show compassion for the
future of their careers by
refusing to involve the police
and dealing with it internally.
Security staff are much
mocked at IC, not least in the
Felix office, but I was really
impressed with the way they
handled things. It must be a
fairly thankless task.
But I do think it's
remarkable that because we
are students, with the priv-
eledge of having a better edu-
cation than most, we have a
license to get away with
things that other members of
the community would be
condemned for. The idea
seems to be that we are
meant to do great things for
society, and we can't possibly
be allowed to jeopardise that
by publicising the fact that
sometimes we're fairly
degenerate.
S e l k i r k
Enough of this being nice to
people - lets come out and
admit the truth: pettiness and
the art of being over-critical is
still alive and well and living
at Imperial. During one of the
brief moments I got to spend
in my hall of residence this
week I was regaled with that
most encouraging of greet-
ings: "No one reads Felix
because it's shit." O n trying
my best to find out what they
thought I should do to
improve the student newspa-
per, I was told it was full of
inaccuracies. "Like what?", I
said. "Well," came the reply,
"you said that a gigabyte of
R A M cost £100, but every-
one knows you can get four
gigabytes for that much."
Aaah.
