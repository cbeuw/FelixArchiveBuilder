exhibition: cezannehark-1
As you have probably gathered from all the
hype of the last week, the Cezanne exhibition
has arrived at the Tate yesterday. All tastes are
catered for: whether you're a mere passer-by
looking for a few (well, over a hundred) fine
paintings, an art historian studying the evolution
of Cezanne's work, or an accomplished artist
searchingforinspiration: it's all here.
The Cezanne exhibition is one of the largest
ever put together and is a rare opportunity to
assess the many facets of a very influential
painter. From the dark and gloomy start, when
he was lookingforhis way, to the mature years,
when he openly preached post-impressionism,
and onto the final stages with what many hail as
his masterpiece, the Grande Baigneuses: it's all
here.
One can all but see the evolution of his ideas
and how he came to formulate his theories.
Some people give their vision of the world with
others painters' techniques. Cezanne used his
vision of what technique should be, to create a
new world. Some people are popular, but are
hated by the pros because of their excessive sim-
plification. Cezanne stunned the art world with
his theories, but was never popular in his own
life-time.
Cezanne had an incredible ability to play
with light purely in colour terms, by juxtaposing
carefully worked brush strokes. Some paintings
are dark, others are light, but unlike the classical
period, it is the whole canvas that is infused with
light. He managed to transcend the academia of
the day, while still portraying the magic of moth-
er Nature - something the twentieth century
failed to catch on to.
The exhibition is a great opportunity to see
these paintings in a large format, with their true
colours and brilliance. It is fabulous to be able to
stand back twenty feet, and see the overall har-
mony; this could never be achieved through
books alone. There are ten rooms arranged
chronologically, so that the themes of each phase
are clearly visible. These include two rooms ded-
icated to his water-colours and drawings (one for
each of the earlier and the later phases). These
give a great insight into his home life as well as his
approach of the subject matter.
You also have a unique opportunity to see
for yourself why the twentieth century artists
claimed him their godfather. The French
crowds, mad as they may be, flocked in their
hundreds of thousands to the exhibition at the
Grand Palais. So, who knows, you might get a
glimpse of what Cezanne was, and is, all about,
but be prepared to spend an hour or two going
over it. You'll be amazed.
If you missed your chance in 1907, don't
miss this one.
