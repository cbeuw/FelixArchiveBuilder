Abandon:
Jazz/Rock & Ents
Tonight, in conjuction with ents, the Jazz
and Rock club presents an evening of quality
live music in the ents lounge. We have four
very different bands playing, and so you can
have some idea of the styles, we have got
each of the bands to describe themselves: no
easy feat...
The evening kicks off with a band by the
name of Neither Both: J.Bolger (drums /
vocals), G.Gladdish (bass) and D.Owen
(guitar / vocals) met by chance after being
enlisted by Noddy Holder (formally of
Slade) for an ambitious jazz exploration.
They decided to go it alone after discovering
a shared interest in quality 80's pop
(Squeeze, The Police) and a mysterious
character from Liverpool, Purple Ackey
(Check out the song). This, their final gig,
(Dave is leaving to pursue a solo career) will
be a mix of covers and original material.
The second band of the evening call
themselves Fold (No sheep jokes please).
They describe themselves as being a seminal
Imperial College band who are forging a new
front in the integration of computer
technology with malicious beats and gravity-
defying guitar riffs. They are a four-piece
androgenous fronted (Huh ?) melding of an
aloof techno programmer/guitarist, two lead
singers, potentially stable drummer, a bass
boy, and a guitar girl. "Just remember what
your Momma used to do to your trousers...."
Yes, well...
The third band call themselves Urban
Spice, and say "don't f'***ing bother with
the rock disco in the U D H . Come down to
the ents lounge and hear it for real, when the
five horsemen of the rock apocalypse hit
Imperial at the start of their World
Domination tour. We're on a one way trip to
rock oblivion, and we haven't even paid the
fare..."
So, no Phil Collins covers there then...
Finally the fourth and funky-ist band of
the night, are Herb: subject your ears to a
sensual blend of the most select funk and
tone-heavy riffs. This flavoursome power
trio were harvested in the groove orchard, by
the estranged cousin of John Begg.
As to who John Begg is, well lets just
say, you don't need to know.
Each band will be playing a half hour
set, starting from around 8-30pm in the ents
lounge. There is also a indie/rock disco
upstairs in the U D H carrying on all night.

Where's Shropshire?
This, and any other questions have been
answered by the ICYHA, the fellwanderers.
A few of us had a vague idea that Shropshire
lies on this side of the Welsh border and late
on Friday this was confirmed. Wheathill
proved to be a no-frills youth hostel but
once our bodies had raised the temperature
a little above zero we came to love the place;
even the outdoor loos and nasty cats.
Saturday's walking was around Brown
Clee Hill in the stunning snow and ice. This
made keeping vertical tricky enough,
without the all day snowball fight.
Connoisseurs of gorse walking were a
bit disappointed that the ice took the edge
off the excitement but it kept the
photographers happy and made the whole
place magic. Home to crash out in front of
the fire while chef set about inventing a
recipe for paella. After not-so-Irish stew and
the legendary Neopolitan Angel Delight on
our excellent New Year trip to the Lake
District, Oily is scared of nothing, except
being caught with his long trousers on.
Following a fry-up and a castle stop,
Sunday's walks were on the Longmynd.
While one group tested Church Stretton's
hospitality after a reasonable walk the rest of
us preferred a longer hike. Great views in
the valleys but none on top, though
somehow we avoided walking in circles. The
long ice slide down the frozen road rates
highly among the year's exhilarating
moments. As always, a great time was had
by all. , .
So no more boring weekends. Take a
walk on the wild side. Meet us in Southside
at 1pm on Thursdays.
