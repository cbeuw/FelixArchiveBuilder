Tories plan to abolish student grants
BY MIKE INGRAM
Government plans to abolish
maintenance grants for students
and impose a 'graduate tax' have
been revealed this week. The
proposals would scrap the exist-
ing system of grants and loans in
favour of compulsory loans
repaid through national insurance
contributions.
The new approach to stu-
dent finances, launched this
week by the Conservative
Political Centre, would not affect
funding of tuition fees. They aim
to release the Â£1.7 billion spent
annually on student financial sup-
port, which amounts to about
30% of the total spending on
higher education. This money
would then be used to fund
teaching and research, perhaps in
lieu of some current funding.
Similar schemes have been oper-
ating in Australia and New
Zealand for several years.
The scheme is intended to
be funded by the private sector,
with money from banks and pen-
sion schemes. This could poten-
tially cause problems for the gov-
ernment. Last year, the high
street banks refused to become
involved with the present
Student Loans system, fearing it
to be a financial liability. They
may be cautious about investing
such large sums of money.
As a result of this, the plan's
authors recommend that the
maintenance loans scheme
should first be tested using post-
graduate students as guinea pigs
for the new funding, in order to
iron out problems and reassure
investors.

Students drop in to ICU
BY THE NEWS TEAM
Two Royal School of Mines stu-
dents face I C U disciplinary
action this afternoon after falling
through the ceiling of the union
building during a break-in.
The students were attempt-
ing to gain entry to ICU's Beit
Quad premises in the early hours
of last Friday morning when they
brought down part of an insulat-
ing ceiling, landing in the Union
Print Unit. They broke in via a
street-level window off Bremncr
Road, after an altercation with
I C U stewards on being asked to
leave the premises at closing
time.
The youths fell through the
false ceiling of the room which
houses ICU's presses and print-
ing equipment. They brought
down several ceiling panels,
buckling the frame which sup-
ports the insulating roof.
The students met Union
staff, and claimed to be 'lost'.
College security were alerted,
and the students subsequently
signed full confessions, offering
to pay the for the damage. The
bill for the repairs, which
involved calling out an emer-
gency engineer to replace the
glass at 12.30am on Friday morn-
ing, may come to several hun-
dred pounds. It is not known
what punishment the discipli-
nary committee is likely to
impose.
Election Reticence
After a slow start to the week,
only one candidate is fully sec-
onded for his position in the sab-
batical elections for next year's
union officers. Nominations are
open for a further week, page 3

2:1 or 2:2?
The value of the 2:1 degree clas-
sification came under scrutiny
this week as it was revealed that
the number of 2:1 awarded
nationwide was comparable to
the number of 2:2s. page 2
