The south-Mediterranean dominated O S C basketball tourna-
ment is finally over. The Hellenic team, pictured here looking rather
pleased with themselves, beat the Cypriots in the final last Saturday.
Virgins In No Whining
After Defeat Shock
UDMS 27 - 0 VIRGINS
After a string of last minute can-
cellations, the Virgins eventually
found a team that wasn't too
scared to play them. The result
was disappointing, but the team
performance was superb against a
challenging opposition, in what
was certainly our toughest and
possibly our most enjoyable
match this season.
IC held off the sustained
Guys' attack with some excep-
tional defensive play from for-
wards and backs alike. It was
only in the dying moments that
U D M S managed to score after
having occupied the Virgins 22
for almost the whole half. The IC
pack was playing exceptionally
well, continually putting pressure
on Guys', even after the loss of
second row pack leader Caroline
Deetjen due to injury.

LSE V 1 - 2 IC IV
Despite being refereed by the
person previously described as
"Hitleresque", Imperial man-
aged a superb result overcoming
league positions and beating by
two goals to one the London
School of Economics: the team
who had reached the semi-finals
of the League Cup. Again
Imperial were reduced to ten
men, though not this time by an
unjust referee, but by a cruel
and savage long-term injury to
Jez Maslin.
IC took the lead as early as
the fourth minute from a well
crafted corner driven in by
Michael Townsend and clinically
finished by Pistol Pete.
Although the opposition
equalised soon afterwards
Imperial College scored a
deserved winner following pro-
longed spells of attacking play
when a cross by Morgan Hill
found the head of Ryan
Loughlins. He expertly picked
out the top comer; the only
place where the opposition
'keeper could not reach.
After overcoming late pres-
sure cleared up by a determined
'keeper, IC held on for their sec-
ond win in three games and
moved further clear of relega-
tion.

From IC
Last Saturday, the IC men's
fencing squad travelled for 11.5
hours to reach Aberystwyth for
the I st knock-out round of the
BUSA championships The foil
was comfortably won 8-1 thanks
to Ed 'Crazy-Legs' Rysdale, Alex
Davies, and Charlie 'light-fin-
gered' â€¢ Cooper. The epee was
won 6-3, clinching victory with
the help of Reuben 'Wild Thing'
Kalam. The sabre was also con-
vincingly won 6-3 by Charlie,
Nick 'Ray' Manton and Richard
Came, despite some abysmal
refereeing from Aberystwyth.
This gave an overall victory of
20-7 to IC, which was celebrat-
ed by the traditional 'let's throw
the captain in the Irish Sea' joke.
Ha- bloody-ha, lads.
