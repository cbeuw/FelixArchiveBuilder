Aitken places Britain on world map
BY ALEX FEAKES
Jonathan Aitken, the Con-
servative M P for Thanet South,
outlined his vision of Britain as a
strong contender in world trade
during a talk at Imperial College
on Wednesday. He complained
that present politics was too
locussed on the European situa-
tion, and more attention should
he given to the rest ot the world
which accounts for 65% of
Britain's exports.
Although stating his Euro-
sceptic credentials, the M P did
not advocate withdrawing from
Europe, and stressed the benefits
that the single market brought to
Britain. He expressed the view
that Britain's trading position in
Europe was advantageous, espe-
cially as Britain had fulfilcd three
of four 'virtues' of healthy eco-
nomics: steady growth, low infla-
tion and falling unemployment.
The fourth, that of an export-led
recovery in growth, had not yet
been reached, Mr Aitken indicat-
ing that that this ought to be
achieved by increasing Britain's
exports with non-European coun-
tries.
"Britain is seen as a 'paradise'
for inward investors" he said, cit-
ing the example of the car indus-
try, which although ironically
almost entirely foreign-owned, is
one of the best performing sec-
tors in the country. However, he
dismissed talk of Britain being
trapped in the slow lane of a two-
speed Europe, being rather more
concerned that Britain might lan-
guish in the slow lane of a two-
speed world. Additionally the"
social aspects of the European
Union, especially the Social
Chapter, came under criticism,
there being 'too many require-
ments' that made industry
uncompetitive.
Mr Aitken refused to com-
ment on the his involvement with
B M A R C and the arms-to-Iraq
affair, saying that he was due to
give evidence to the Scott inquiry
next month, though he refuted
allegations in last week's papers
that he had changed his story.
However, he did field questions
on the arms industry generally,
saying that he was not of the
opinion that 'defence exports
shouldn't happen," himself being
proud of Britain's 21% of the
world defence market. The ques-
tion of morality was brushed
aside because "Britain operates
the most restrictive and protec-
tive" procedures for granting
export licences.
Finishing on the subject of
John Major's leadership and the
defection of Emma Nicholson,
the M P declared himself happy
with the Prime Minister.
However, he said that he 'could-
n't recognise the same act of
principle' that marked out Alan
Howarth's defection last year to
Labour from Emma Nicholson's
recent crossing of the floor to the
Liberal Democrats, the latter
provoking a storm of protests.
2:1 value dropping:
7
BY MARK BRIDGE
Reports by the Higher Education
Quality Council last month indi-
cating the proportion of 2:1 to
2:2 degrees to be higher than at
any other time were confirmed
this week when national data on
degree classes were published.
This might be perceived as a
dropping of standards by those
outside academia but Prof
Swanson, Pro Rector lor
Educational Quality at Imperial
College, said that the basis for
awards was arbitrary, with
Universities using several and
various criteria lor deciding the
class of degree to be conferred by
the degree awarding body.
Although Imperial College's
board of Studies could shift the
boundaries from year to year, any
anomalous or systematic shifts
would be spotted by the
University of London, who have
the statutory power to award IC
degrees and a responsibility to
ensure its various constituents
comply with University regula-
tions. The same applies to other
Universities, but the proportion
of achieving students at a place
like Imperial might also be
expected to be greater given the
calibre of applicants he added.
Another factor in the
changes may be the massive
increase in degree awarding bod-
ies that came about when poly-
technics were granted University
status in 1993. Universities can
choose to give degree classes by
looking at the criteria other good
Universities use in assessments
or it might consider its students
to be better than average and
step its degree class boundaries
accordingly. Therefore, the
somewhat arbitrary nature of and
random discrepencies in degree
classification across the country,
can be explained.
Gillian Roberts, the
Registrar at the University of
London, was not available at the
time of going to press and infor-
mation on variations in the pro-
portions of the various degree
classes awarded at University of
London constituent colleges is
not obtainable. However, Pi, the
student newspaper of University
College London Union reported
broad fluctuations in degree class
proportions across a range of
departments at U C L over the
past few years. Imperial
College's Board of Studies, how-
ever, have published papers
showing very little change in the
proportions of the various
degrees classes awarded.
Holocaust survivor visits IC
BY ALEX FEAKES
IC Jewish Society hosted a talk
from Holocaust survivor Gene
Turgel this week, in conjunction
with the Beth Shalom Holocaust
Memorial Centre.
Mrs Turgel talked for an
hour to an audience of nearly a
hundred, covering her experi-
ences of living under the Nazis.
Her story spanned the time
from the occupation of her home
town, Krakow in Poland, in 1939
when she was thirteen, to her lib-
eration from the Belsen death
camp in 1945. Before and after
her talk, her audience were invit-
ed to walk around a display set
up by the Beth Shalom centre
detailing the rise of the Nazis and
describing the concentration and
extermination camps that they
constructed.
Mrs Turgel sketched her
life, through her family's perse-
cution by the occupying Nazis
and their internment in a Jewish
ghetto. With her mother she was
moved to Auschwitz, where hun-
dreds of prisoners a day died in
labour gangs working in back-
breaking conditions in quarries.
They were moved through a
number of other camps, includ-
ing Berkenau and Buchenwald,
until finally they were taken to
Belsen, known as a 'finishing
camp'.
The British Army liberated
Belsen on 15th April 1945, and
in the unit that entered the camp
Gene met her future husband,
Norman. They were quickly mar-
ried and when Norman was de-
mobbed, they went back to
England to live.
Minorities bias in Oxford
BY ALEX FEAKES
Oxford University's entrance
procedures are biased against
applicants from racial minorities
according to a report published
in the latest edition of the uni-
versity's newspaper, Cherwell.
The apparent favouring of
candidates from white, privately
educated backgrounds was con-
sidered "very disappointing
indeed" by Julia Stephenson of
the equal opportunities Access
Scheme.
The statistics showed whites
were four times more likely to
get in than non-whites.
Overseas students were only
half as likely to get in as home
students.
