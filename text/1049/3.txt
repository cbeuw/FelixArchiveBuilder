NEWS FELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 9TH 1 9 9 6 . THREE
Levy fees imminent, but not for IC
BY MIKE INGRAM
The Committee of Vice
Chancellors and Principals
(CVCP) met at the University of
London last Friday to discuss
imposing a 'top-up' levy on stu-
dents in order to make up the
deficit in the funding of Univer-
sities and Colleges next year.
In an extremely unusual
move, the committee held a vote
on the idea, resulting in a deci-
sion to impose a "government
deficit levy" from October 1997
if the next Budget does not
increase funding. The size of this
levy is undecided. A one-off
charge of £300 per student has
been suggested, but one universi-
ty head has said that would be
inadequate, proposing a "realis-
tic" levy of up to £1000 per year.
The Committee is also
threatening to withdraw from
other Government schemes,
including quality assessment, ip
January 1997. These measures
are timed to have maximum
political effect on the Govern-
ment, which will be facing an
imminent general election.
The Committee will with-
draw if the Government does not
make two concessions: firstly,
this year's budget must include
"some significant reversal" of the
capital cuts in last year's Budget.
Secondly, they must signal an
intention to introduce an
income-contingent loans scheme
covering both fees and mainte-
nance by 1999. These measures
will be discussed at a meeting
between C V C P leaders and
Education Secretary Gillian
Shephard this week.
However, support for these
measures is by no means unani-
mous within the Committee. A
poll conducted by the Times
Higher Education Supplement
last week revealed that, of the
twenty-five universities against
the imposition of levies, only
eight planned to go ahead with
the scheme if the majority was in
favour. The proposal to withdraw
from quality assessment schemes
has also been attacked as "utterly
self destructive". The final deci-
sion on whether to impose these
measures will be made in
December.
The Rector, Sir Ronald
Oxburgh, has reiterated Imperial
College's opposition to imposing
top-up fees: "IC has no intention
of charging a £300 fee - it would
achieve almost nothing for the
College." He added: "It is the
clear view of the heads of depart-
ments that we would not impose
a system that disadvantaged the
less well-off student."
Alternative options for the CVCP
It would be possible to increase Principals, who have been meet-
available funding per student by
reducing the number of students
admitted. The Higher Education
Funding Council for England
(HEFCE) said last week that the
option ol reducing student intake
has been left "deliberately open"
(Felix 1048). However, the
Standing Conference of
ing the C V C P to discuss funding
cuts, have said that college heads
are sceptical about reducing stu-
dent numbers without guaran-
tees that funding levels would be
unaffected.
The deadline for universities
to submit student level informa-
tion to the H E F C E is today.
AUT ally with CVCP
The Association of University
Teachers has rejected the possi-
bility of industrial action as a
protest at the budget cuts. In an
unprecedented move, the Union
is seeking to ally with the C V C P
to fight the cuts. This has caused
controversy within the organisa-
tion, leading one member to
describe it as "shackling ourselves
to the enemy".
Since Colleges can spend up
to 80% of their budget on staff
salaries, the funding crisis could
seriously damage the union's
chances with their 1996/97 pay
claim. The claim does not yet
specify a desired percentage rise,
but attempts to introduce a claim
for a 10% rise or a £3,000
increase at all salary levels have
tailed.
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals met at Senate
House on Malet Street last Friday. Students from a number of
London Colleges and provincial universities turned out to demon-
strate outside the building whilst the Committee met.
Slow Start to Sab Elections
BY RACHEL WALTERS
As Felix went to press, only one
candidate has been fully second-
ed in their bid to stand for next
year's I C U sabbatical positions.
Piers Williams, a final year
chemist and chair of the Union's
publications' board, was the first
to sign up on Monday. He is
standing for the position of
Deputy President (Finance and
Services) and was fully seconded
by Wednesday.
The only person who has
stood for the position of
President so far is Mark Bridge, a
first year chemistry student, but
it is widely expected that Eric
Allsop, the current chair of I C U
council, will put forward his can-
didature this evening.
Neil O'Shaughnessy, a
Union steward, has stood for the
position of Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies), leaving
the post of Felix Editor / Print
Unit Manager with no contes-
tants at all. It is expected that
Alex Feakes, currently news edi-
tor of Felix, will stand for the
position.
Nominations papers will be
posted outside the union office
for a further week, after which
the candidates are allowed two
weeks for campaigning. Hustings
will be held at I C U on Tuesday
February 27th, and at St Mary's
on Wednesday February 28th.
Voting will take place in all
departments on March 4th and
5th.
