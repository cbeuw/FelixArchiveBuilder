Right Angles To Reality
Holidays
I
k n e w all t h e w o r d s to every s o n g o n
RevolverbyIhe time I was eight. W h e n
you consider that M o z a r t h a d already
written a n o p e r a a n d half a d o z e n harp-
sichord concertos by t h e s a m e a g e , m y
being able to sing a l o n g to t h e Beatles'
ground-breaking seventh a l b u m begins to
look like very small indeed. A four-year-
old in Hydrabad calculates pi to thirty
thousand decimal places, a n d all I can say
in reply is "I w a s alone, I took a ride, I did-
n't k n o w w h a t I w o u l d find ther-
rrrrrrreeee". Pathetic Isn't it? But that's m e
all over - delusions o f adequacy. T h e
inequalities in life are patently unfair. W h y
should o n e child turn out a mathematical
genius whilst all t h e other can d o is sing
the descant part to Got To Get You Into
My Life! Eschewing the convention that
o n e never d o e s reply to rhetorical ques-
tions, I will venture an explanation. It's just
a wild guess, but I w o u l d say that t h e
hypothetical Indian boy-wonder described
above spent his s u m m e r vacations play-
ing with a n abacus instead o f g o i n g o n
caravanning holidays with m y family.
Let m e take y o u back to t h e balmy
s u m m e r of 7 7 - Ginny h a d w o n at W i m -
bledon, the Q u e e n o f England w a s cele-
brating 25 years at t h e t o p a n d t h e King
of rock a n d roll w a s mere w e e k s away
from the most celebrated bout o f termi-
nal constipation in history. M e a n w h i l e , in
deepest Bedfordshire my father w a s fitting
a Blaupunkt car cassette player in o u r
Cortina in preparation for our overland trip
to the Dordogne. It w a s the first time that
w e had had a tape player in t h e car a n d
my brother and I were more excited about
it than t h e glorious French countryside
that awaited us. Unfortunately w e only
possessed three cassettes; Revolver by
The Beatles, Abba: The Album a n d Englc-
bert Humperclink 20 Golden Greats, to
take o n the 1,200 mile round trip. With
such a narrowness o f choice, rivalling
anything that Soviet-era Russian super-
markets didn't have to offer, I must have
heard all three albums upwards o f four
d o z e n times during t h e journey a n d it is
no coincidence that at the a g e of eight my
knowledge o f Lennon-McCartney lyrics
from the mid-60s w a s u n m a t c h e d by a n y
of my classmates at the Alger Hiss Primary
School. The s a m e trip left m e with t h e
ability to give peerless renditions of Name
ofthe Game a n d Release Me, w h i c h w a s
a bit spooky in o n e so y o u n g .
G o i n g o n holiday as a child w a s by
turns a frustrating a n d delightful busi-
ness- the journey itself w a s a s e e m i n g l y
never-ending sojourn in purgatory. N o t
quite a ' H o m e w a r d Bound'-esque " e n d -
less stream o f cigarettes a n d m a g a z i n e s "
(more a case o f Sherbert Dib-Dabs a n d
The Dandyat that age), but it w a s a bit o f
atrial for the nerves. How- â€ž
ever, w h e n t h e monoto- /Wall
nous motorway drive from
hell w a s over a n d the caravan w a s jacked
up onto its little blocks o f w o o d , a n d t h e
enticing smell o f roasting meat w a s e m a -
nating from t h e expertly tended barbecue
set u p outside the proudly pitched stripy
awning, y o u could sink back into your
reclining s u n b e d , sip o n your pre-dinner
Vimto a n d feel that life w a s g o o d a n d by
a n d large it h a d all b e e n worth it.
Well, that's the John-Boy Walton Spe-
cial Edition version anyway. The truth is
somewhat less inspiring. W e w o u l d arrive
at the site o n average three hours late d u e
to m y father losing his w a y because m y
mother, w h o w a s navigating, had tried to
direct h i m d o w n a crease in t h e m a p
w h i c h s h e h a d mistaken for the B4530 or
s o m e such. To his credit, my father never
shouted at her in front of m y younger
brother a n d I, rather h e put o n his I
-
haven't-the-slightest-idea-where-l-am-but-
if-l-show-any-weakness-my-status-as-an-
authority-figure-will-be-irreparably-dam-
a g e d face a n d b e g a n to whistle with
forced gaiety. Unfortunately the rest o f
us had rumbled this ploy a long time ago,
with t h e result that w e k n e w that w h e n
Dad started to affect nonchalance, things
had started to g o seriously w r o n g a n d It
was time to panic. The worse t h e crisis
got, t h e m o r e devil-me-care h e w o u l d
b e c o m e until m y brother a n d I w o u l d b e
close to tears a n d m y mother w o u l d b e
o n t h e verge o f a nervous breakdown.
This particular idiosyncrasy o f m y father's
character only s e e m e d to c o m e out dur-
ing our holiday expeditions a n d w a s not
at all eased by t h e remarkable propensity
that o u r caravan displayed for finding
i. every single sharp object
or c l u m p o f broken glass
on the road, with the result
that w e w o u l d routinely get through four
or five tyres o n a n average trip.
S o m e h o w or other w e w o u l d m a k e
it back onto the right road a n d my father's
fixed icy grin w o u l d relax into a harassed
frown, w h i c h w a s m u c h m o r e what o n e
w o u l d have expected of a m a n strug-
gling to keep a Cortina M k IV a n d a cara-
van o n t h e road in a crosswind, whilst his
kids fought over w h o s a w t h e yellow
Masarati first a n d alternately t h u m p e d
each other a n d cried out for his wife to
arbitrate. Eventually w e w o u l d arrive with
my brother a n d I covered in bruises a n d
my parents arguing over w h o w a s g o i n g
to get custody o f "the s o d d i n g kids" after
the divorce proceedings o n w h i c h they
w o u l d embark the minute that this " d a m n
holiday" was over. The campsites at which
w e stayed normally resembled recently
reclaimed malarial s w a m p s , o n w h i c h
s o m e o n e had erected s o m e shower/toi-
let blocks w h i c h looked m o r e like a cou-
ple o f pill-boxes left over f r o m WWII. T h e
caravan w o u l d be parked a n d the a w n i n g
erected after a fashion. The a w n i n g w a s
indeed stripy, but it had b e e n patched u p
more times than Grant a n d Tiff's mar-
riage a n d as a result it leaked like a badly-
fitting Pampers. W h e n it rained, as it
invariably did (I've a feeling that w e r e w e
to have taken a trip to Death Valley in Ari-
z o n a during the late '70s our arrival w o u l d
have b e e n heralded by a cloudburst), t h e
water collected in puddles in the insuffi-
ciently taut roof o f the a w n i n g m a k i n g it
sag like a S u m o wrestler's tits. Inevitably
s o m e o n e w o u l d flick the bulging fabric
from below in an attempt to get rid o f the
rainwater a n d e n d u p putting their fist
through the canvas, necessitating another
repair.
M y father's barbecue technique w a s
another point o f contention. According
to The Observer's Book o f Campfire Cui-
sine, "sufficient time must be allowed for
any flames to die d o w n before grilling the
meat over g l o w i n g coals". M y father had
not read this chapter a n d w o u l d put the
meat o n the griddle before t h e charcoal
was fully burned d o w n , such that the fat
f r o m t h e meat w o u l d drip onto t h e fire,
with t h e result that our campsite neigh-
bours w o u l d b e treated to t h e spectacle
of him desperately trying to bring a Piper
Alpha scale inferno under control, and w e
w o u l d b e left t o eat s o m e t h i n g that
resembled a cremated mole. Either this
or h e w o u l d b e unable to get the barbe-
cue to light in t h e force nine gale which
w o u l d inevitably appear, m u c h like the
proverbial N o . 22 bus w h e n you've just lit
a cigarette, so that he w o u l d be forced to
pile o n t h e firelighters in a vain attempt
to get t h e thing burning, with the result
that everything e n d e d u p tasting faintly
of paraffin.
Ah, happy days. W e shall not s e e
their like again. At least I hope not. That's
the reason that I'm regurgitating all this
n o w - s o that I don't forget it. For, as a
well-known dictator put it, " H e w h o does
not r e m e m b e r history is c o n d e m n e d to
repeat it". M e g a l o m a n i a c or n o megalo-
maniac, he got that bit right at least. How-
ever, in t h e light o f m y lengthy a n d
fraught holiday travels, I can't s e e m e
forcing m y kids t o sit for hours in a stuffy
Ford with only Revolverfot entertainment.
But then again - T o m o r r o w Never Knows.
