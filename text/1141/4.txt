- yes, that m e a n s that IC d a n c e r s m o v e
those hips a n d d i g those rhythms better
than any other university in t h e country.
That is, in DanceSport - Latin A m e r i c a n
a n d Ballroom D a n c i n g - a n e w O l y m p i c
sport, w h i c h held its Student National
C h a m p i o n s h i p s , equivalent t o t h e BUSA
championships, o n 7 M a r c h this year. IC
b e c a m e c h a m p i o n out o f t h e 22 other
universities, reaffirming its tradition o f
p r o d u c i n g t h e highest quality dancers,
which has resulted in over 15 wins at t h e
Nationals over t h e last 30 years.
Contrary to p u b l i c p e r c e p t i o n ,
DanceSport is highly d e m a n d i n g a n d
requires a lot o f physical fitness as well
as agility a n d control. Despite t h e s i m -
ilarity, it differs f r o m its social d a n c i n g
c o u n t e r p a r t , rather like r u n n i n g a
marathon is pretty far r e m o v e d f r o m
g o i n g f o r a S u n d a y a f t e r n o o n stroll.
O t h e r universities have taken it s o seri-
ously that they have started to award full
colours for their w i n n i n g dancers, e.g.
O x f o r d University, w h i c h has a w a r d e d
Full Blue Status to several o f its dancers.
