Just what does the future hold?
Ian Blackler examines attempts at social prediction using mathematical models, and comes to some sobering conclusions...
The Club of Rome
Most of us enjoy television s h o w s such as Star Trek, a n d
many of us share their Utopian v i e w o f t h e future o f
h u m a n society. But just h o w realistic are w e being?
The United Nations' Population Division has just
produced an alarming set o f world population statistics.
What is more, a c c o r d i n g to a g r o u p o f MIT researchers
they s h o w that h u m a n society is f o l l o w i n g a path to its
o w n destruction.
The researchers w e r e first c o m m i s s i o n e d in t h e
1960s, a n d again in the 1990s, by a s h a d o w y organi-
sation k n o w n as "The Club o f Rome". M a d e u p o f
statesmen, business leaders a n d politicians, the society's
interests lay in a subject they called "The Global Prob-
lematique." What they desired w a s a scientific, rational
prediction o f the future o f m a n k i n d .
The results o f the first study w e r e presented in 1972
in the b o o k "The Limits to G r o w t h " , w h i c h b e c a m e a n
instant best seller world-wide. Its c o n c l u s i o n s w e r e ter-
rifying. Unless there w e r e major c h a n g e s , h u m a n civil-
isation w o u l d collapse b e f o r e the year 2100.
The danger, they say, lies in the combination o f sev-
eral important factors. Firstly, t h e earth has limited
resources, a n d a limited capacity to c o p e with h u m a n
d e m a n d s . Also, o n c e p e o p l e have b e c o m e aware that
they are approaching o n e o f the earth's limits, they take
time to m a k e c h a n g e s to r e m e d y t h e situation.
A g o o d example o f this is the discovery o f the h o l e
in the o z o n e layer. W h e n t h e industrial value o f CFCs
was discovered in the 1930s, u s a g e swiftly b e c a m e
widespread, but n o o n e u n d e r s t o o d the potential envi-
ronmental impact. T h e d a n g e r s w e r e eventually n o t e d
in 1974, but the 'Montreal Protocol' to limit world-wide
CFC production w a s not ratified until 1984.
The other part o f the p r o b l e m stems f r o m the p h e -
n o m e n o n o f exponential g r o w t h . This h a p p e n s w h e n
s o m e t h i n g develops in such a w a y that t h e m o r e there
is, the quicker it grows, like t h e m o n e y In your bank
account. M a n y aspects o f h u m a n civilisation appear to
be g r o w i n g exponentially, such as population, c o n -
s u m p t i o n o f raw materials a n d energy requirements.
Hopefully, w e should have plenty o f warning before
anything major g o e s w r o n g . T e c h n o l o g y is a d v a n c i n g
rapidly, leading to better pollution m o n i t o r i n g systems,
for example.
In response to these arguments, the researchers
p r e s e n t e d a n o l d French riddle for s c h o o l c h i l d r e n
regarding exponential growth:
"Suppose y o u o w n a p o n d , o n w h i c h a water lily is
g r o w i n g . The lily plant d o u b l e s in size every day. If the
plant w e r e allowed to g r o w u n c h e c k e d , it w o u l d cover
the p o n d completely in 30 days, completely c h o k i n g o f f
all other form s o f life in the water. For a l o n g time t h e
lily plant s e e m s small, so y o u decide not to worry about
it until it covers half the p o n d . O n what day will that be?
O n the twenty-ninth day. Y o u have just o n e day to
act to save your pond."
It w o u l d a p p e a r f r o m t h e team's research that
humanity is o n the "twenty-ninth day", a n d that a radi-
cal c h a n g e in behaviour is necessary to avoid a total col-
lapse. T e c h n o l o g y is not e n o u g h .
Modelling with System Dynamics
The computer models w e r e built u p using a branch
of mathematics called 'System Dynamics'. U s e d in
m a k i n g stock market predictions a n d e c o n o m i c fore-
casts, it has swiftly b e c o m e a powerful tool in the busi-
ness w o r l d .
The modelling works essentially of the basis of feed-
back loops. These c o m e in t w o different forms,- posi-
tive a n d negative. Positive f e e d b a c k loops e n c o u r a g e
a c h a n g e in the system (like the lily, the bigger it is, the
faster it grows), w h e r e a s negative feedback loops tend
to o p p o s e change in the system, forcing it back to a cer-
tain value.

System dynamics c o m b i n e s these l o o p s to make
incredibly sophisticated m o d e l s that have great pre-
dictive qualities.
Obviously assumptions h a d to be m a d e . For e x a m -
ple, there is n o difference in the program b e t w e e n fish
stocks a n d oil reserves. The difference b e t w e e n the t w o
in predictive terms is quite clear. Fish stocks can recover
(though obviously if you kill all the fish, they aren't going
to c o m e back), whilst oil reserves can't (at least not o n
the time scales w e are interested in).
The predictions m a d e by t h e g r o u p w e r e never
expected to be quantitative. It w o u l d be arrogant in the
extreme to assume that a program that uses generalised
parameters, such as 'resources', a n d a s s u m e s that the
entire population o f the planet lives in equality could
tell y o u your children's average life expectancy. What
y o u can rely o n , say the t e a m , are t h e general trends
s h o w n by t h e simulation.
W h e n they w e r e c o m m i s s i o n e d to repeat their
work in 1992, the t e a m w a s able to set about the task
with n e w Information a n d use m o r e complex modelling.
What they f o u n d w a s a s t o u n d i n g . They say that
humanity w a s not just a p p r o a c h i n g the limits of sus-
tainability, it h a d e x c e e d e d t h e m in m a n y ways. H o w -
ever, further m o d e l l i n g revealed that this d o e s not
necessarily m e a n i n e s c a p a b l e d o o m . What it d o e s
s e e m to m e a n , however, is that t h e longer w e take to
modify our behaviour towards a sustainable society, the
lower our quality o f life will b e o n c e w e attain it.
A c c o r d i n g to the U N Population Division's report,
however, there is as yet n o sign o f a decline in the rate
of population growth. In fact, they think that the growth
is not just exponential, but 'super-exponential'.
W e can all h o p e that the researchers are w r o n g , but
this seems unlikely, since their m o d e l is based u p o n very
s i m p l e , f u n d a m e n t a l p r e m i s e s . Also, t h e t e a m
attempted to resolve the p r o b l e m s that they foresaw
by postulating m o r e a n d m o r e ludicrously optimistic sit-
uations. They invariably failed.
W h a t c a n w e d o to prevent this dis-
aster? Well, the researchers suggest a
harsh but simple solution; cease all forms
of g r o w t h . This d o e s not m e a n stagna-
tion, since t e c h n o l o g i c a l d e v e l o p m e n t
can still c o n t i n u e , but the earth cannot
tolerate the strains i m p o s e d by a p o p u -
lation e x p l o s i o n , c o u p l e d with our
extreme profligacy.
It m a y well be that the time for indul-
g e n c e is past.
