L
ast years Rae & Christian album
Northern Sulphuric Soul was high
on my list when It came to choos-
ing my favourite albums of the year, so
naturally I leapt at the chance of Inter-
viewing band frontman Mark Rae.
For those of you who haven't heard
of Rae & Christian, their music could be
described as hip-hop with more than
Just a hint of soul added to spice up the
sounds. With guest vocalists on their
album as diverse as the Jungle Brothers
and Sharleen from Texas, the music pro-
duced never fails to Impress.
As well as being a key member of
the band, Mark Rae Is also head of M a n -
chester's Grand Central record label.
When we met he had just come back
from a tour of Australia. Tired, he started
with a yawn, but Mark Rae Is definitely
not one to complain.
Felix: So h o w w a s 1998 for y o u then?
Mark Rae : A m a z i n g . The highlight w a s
definitely t h e a l b u m . P r o d u c i n g t h e
a l b u m w a s a really o r g a n i c experi- J
ence. W e just did t h e music, a n d f
then t h o u g h t a b o u t w h a t w o u l d I
sound g o o d with what. It w a s all very |
simple - everything w e did w o r k e d , j

w o u l d have liked better in both t h e (

kept with it. As l o n g as w e w e r e ji
enjoying it, w e just kept g o i n g for- (
ward.
F: So w h a t d o y o u prefer M a n c h e s t e r or
London?
M R : I love t h e m both really. I s u p p o s e
L o n d o n is not really m y kettle o f fish as
a place to live, but it's a very interesting
place to be in a n d around. Although I've
lived in M a n c h e s t e r for twelve
years n o w , cities aren't really my
kind o f t h i n g - I like t h e country-
side, fishing, a n d stuff like that
too m u c h . I'm f r o m N o r t h u m b r i a origi-
nally.
F: So w h a t lead y o u d o w n to M a n c h e s -
ter then?
M R : I first w e n t d o w n to M a n c h e s t e r to
study. I did an undergraduate d e g r e e in
p s y c h o l o g y a n d t h e n a p o s t g r a d u a t e

d o i n g my o w n thing. M a n c h e s t e r w a s a
very vibrant place at t h e time, a n d I sup-
pose it always will be. It's quite dark a n d
dreary, but it's very funky with loads o f

point that music is now my life and I love It."
F: A n d before w e finish t h e interview I'd
like your answers o n a t w o cheesy A or
B questions. First o f all, Billie or Britney?
M R : I've got respect for Billie at her a g e
dissing her o w n m u s i c a n d g o i n g o n

but at least it s h o w s she's got a

ever quite sexy, but in a horrible

F: As well as the music o n your o w n label
w h a t other music d o y o u listen to?
MR: Well I've never b e e n into the UK hip-
h o p scene, I think it got as far as it c o u l d
then p e o p l e just did jungle instead. The
A m e r i c a n hip-hop scene's pretty crap at
the m o m e n t , apart f r o m t h e u n d e r -

from t h e Cardigans a n d the M a n i c Street
Preachers to reggae a n d dub, I also like

in the music industry?
MR: I s u p p o s e I've d e d i c a t e d t h e last g
ten years o f my life to it to t h e point •
that music is n o w m y life a n d I love it. At
Grand Central w e ' r e not just artists wait-
ing to get signed by majors, w e ' v e g o t a
really strong base; a record s h o p , a p u b -
lishing c o m p a n y , a record label, a licens-

F: What did y o u d o after finishing at uni-
versity, have y o u got any advice for t h e
u n d e c i d e d ?
MR : Well I'd b e e n DJing since I w a s
a b o u t e i g h t e e n , a n d w a s really into
m u s i c s o I started m y o w n record s h o p .
I w a s into soul, hip-hop, Skooly D, early
Public Enemy - a lot o f what's called o l d
school these days. I w a s also into t h e
Jungle Brothers t h e first t i m e round, a n d
it t h e r e f o r e really g o o d to w o r k with
t h e m o n the album. They gave us a really
old s c h o o l s o u n d i n g rhyme.
F : You talk about longevity, a n d I s u p -
pose this is all linked in to diversifying a n d
never d o i n g the s a m e t h i n g twice.
M R : Yeah, w e d o a lot of differ-
ent things f r o m remixing others " ...Britney Is h o w e v e t quite sexy, but in a

We've got an a l b u m c o m i n g out f r o m

F: Being in Manchester t h o u g h y o u must

F : O k then, as it's a n issue that's raging
in all corners, w h o ' s g o i n g to w i n t h e Fat
Boy Slim or A r m a n d van H e l d e n battle?
M R : Well Fat Boy Slim is quite a wiry sort
of lower m i d d l e weight boxer, but he
s m o k e s loads a n d cains it w h i l e v a n
H e l d e n doesn't. So Helden will probably
knock his brains out. N o r m a n probably
c o u l d have b e e n a g o o d boxer if he
kept himself fit, but H c l d e n s h o u l d be
careful as s o m e these wiry lads are d e a d
g o o d at boxing.
F: Finally, l o o k i n g for s o m e ideas myself
w h a t y o u d o i n g for t h e millennium?
M R : Well w e might e n d up in Australia
because t h e fan base over there is amaz-
ing. It might be nice to d o that, but to
be honest with y o u I just want to be with
my family, a n d e v e n if I w a s in a club I'd
w a n t m y family to be there with m c . It
w o u l d probably b e best to g o a n d stand
o n a hill with your family a n d h u g . That
w o u l d be brilliant.
So my chat with Mark Rae showed
how It Is possible to make It big and keep
your feet planted right on the ground.
Rather than the music though, the thing
that stayed with me the most. Is that he
went from postgraduate study to running
a record shop. A story which must give
hope to those final year students expe-
riencing not the most pleasant time In
the Job market at the moment...
