Put Students Before Politics
Various recent events, t o o petty a n d
tedious to g o into here, have f o r c e d m e
to have m o r e i n v o l v e m e n t w i t h ICU
than I w o u l d like, or i n d e e d think is
healthy for t h e editor o f a n i n d e p e n -
dent n e w s p a p e r . O n e thine; that h a s
struck m e is h o w little ' U n i o n h a c k s '
k n o w a b o u t t h e c o m m o n p e r c e p t i o n o f
ICU within t h e student p o p u l a c e .
Let m e explain. ICU is, o f course, a n
organisation w h o s e raison d'etre is t o
provide services a n d o p p o r t u n i t i e s for
t h e s t u d e n t s o f Imperial C o l l e g e . In
other words, it is there to m a k e your life
easier, a n d your t i m e at university g e n -
erally m o r e e n j o y a b l e . For m o s t stu-
d e n t s this m a n i f e s t s itself t h r o u g h
c h e a p beer, f o o d , stationary, n e w s p a -
pers a n d so o n . For m a n y o t h e r s t h e
clubs a n d societies p r o v i d e o p p o r t u n i -
ties that w o u l d o t h e r w i s e b e v e r y diffi-
cult t o take a d v a n t a g e of. In t h e Spring
Term, however, friction is at its greatest.
Why? B e c a u s e it is t h e b u d g e t s e a s o n ,
a n d t h e r e a r e a l w a y s w i n n e r s a n d
losers.
T w o particular a s p e c t s o f this
a n n u a l d e b a t e strike m e as extraordi-
nary, firstly, t h e r e s e e m s t o b e a n
a s s u m p t i o n in t h e U n i o n that t h e stu-
dents w h o run t h e clubs u n d e r s t a n d
U n i o n f i n a n c e s a n d have faith that t h e
system will give t h e m a fair d e a l . Rub-
b i s h . C l u b t r e a s u r e r s a n d o t h e r s
involved are told b y their p r e d e c e s s o r s
that their j o b is to get as m u c h m o n e y
out o f t h e U n i o n as p o s s i b l e , b e c a u s e
t h e U n i o n will try t o d o exactly t h e
s a m e to t h e m . T h e basic p h i l o s o p h y is
'screw t h e m , or else they'll s c r e w y o u ' .
W e all k n o w this, yet w h e n it c o m e s t o
t h e nuts a n d bolts o f c o m m i t t e e m e e t -
ings f e w hacks s e e m to a d m i t it, a n d
certainly not publicly.
The s e c o n d point f o l l o w s f r o m t h e
first. A n ' u s a g a i n s t t h e m ' attitude
b e t w e e n s t u d e n t s a n d ICU is similar to
the attitude b e t w e e n students a n d col-
lege. C o n s e q u e n t l y it is hardly surpris-
ing that m a n y students h a v e difficulty
d i s t i n g u i s h i n g b e t w e e n U n i o n a n d col-
lege run facilities. For e x a m p l e , a fourth
y e a r D e p a r t m e n t a l R e p r e s e n t a t i v e
recently i n f o r m e d m e that he or s h e
c o u l d n ' t s e e a n y d i f f e r e n c e b e t w e e n
U n i o n m o n e y a n d c o l l e g e m o n e y .
The p r o b l e m isn't h e l p e d by t h e
social g r o u p i n g o f U n i o n hacks. I k n o w
this is a g e n e r a l i s a t i o n , a n d I a p o l o g i s e
in a d v a n c e t o a n y o n e m i s r e p r e s e n t e d ,
but in m y o p i n i o n U n i o n p o l i t i c i a n s
t e n d t o h a n g a r o u n d their o w n kind.
Even If it isn't true, i t h i n k this v i e w is
fairly c o m m o n a m o n g IC students, a n d
In this g a m e it's o p i n i o n s that c o u n t .
So w h a t ' s t h e conclusion? Well, just
for o n c e , I haven't really g o t o n e . Just
to b e controversial, I w o u l d say that
p e r h a p s ICU s h o u l d s p e n d m o r e t i m e
c o m m u n i c a t i n g its p r i n c i p l e s , rather
t h a n l o s i n g sight o f t h e m in a m a z e o f
rules a n d regulations that n o o n e out-
s i d e a select g r o u p o f hacks u n d e r -
stands, or i n d e e d cares about. It's t h e
students that matter, a n d it's their o p i n -
ions that count.
Turn on. Tune In and Help Out
If you have read this week's news, you will
have noticed that IC Radio is to have an
F M license for the first m o n t h of next
term. Congratulations to all those Involved
in organising it, including the mysterious
sponsor, a n d I h o p e that it proves suc-
cessful. It will only be successful, however,
if you listen to it. So retune your radio after
Easter and give it a try - you may find it dif-
ferent from the 9 9 9 A M station y o u could-
n't quite pick u p in your hall r o o m during
your first year. Finally, if a n y o n e used to
be involved in the radio but has since
given it up, please consider g o i n g back -
they could d o with your help. This is our
c h a n c e to s h o w that student radio at
Imperial can work - let's use it.
To Bomb or Not to Bomb?
O n c e again t h e international c o m m u -
nity's bluff has b e e n called, a n d o n c e
again they are standing around without a
clue as to what to d o , like the e m o t i o n -
ally unstable half o f the faurel a n d Hardy
duo. N o o n e really wants to b o m b Serbia,
or anywhere else for the matter - it costs
money, lots of money, and as soon as o n e
Western life is lost public opinion turns
against you.
D i p l o m a c y is not an area I k n o w
m u c h about, but it s e e m s to m e there
are t w o basic ways to get people to c o m -
promise. O n e m e t h o d is to get t h e m to
talk a b o u t a n y t h i n g a n d e v e r y t h i n g
except that w h i c h they d i s a g r e e o n .
W h e n p e o p l e a c k n o w l e d g e their simi-
larities, it is generally easier to o v e r c o m e
their differences. The other m e t h o d is to
put t h e m in a r o o m a n d lock t h e door,
a n d wait until they get tired o f arguing
a n d release that c o m p r o m i s e is the only
key to a solution.
So w h a t d o w e do? W e draw u p
plans neither party is happy with, a n d
then give t h e m deadlines by w h i c h they
have to agree, or else... People don't like
b e i n g bullied, a n d in m y experience it
only increases their resolve. If you resort
to threats, y o u are basically saying 'we do
not have a solution'. Worse still, w h e n
those threats are e m p t y ones n o o n e will
take y o u seriously, a n d t h e influence o f
'real' diplomats is severely w e a k e n e d .
Right, That's It. Go Home.
A n o t h e r term has flown by, a n d I still
haven't learned C++. What h a p p e n e d to
the Carl Cox interview w e w e r e meant to
be printing? W h y doesn't Howard Marks
respond to emails? A n d w h e r e is Felix
g o i n g to be next year? I can only h o p e
these matters are resolved in my nine
remaining issues.
M e a n w h i l e I'm off h o m e for my reg-
ular detox, f e e d i n g a n d extended sleep-

look after letters a n d other deliveries over
the holidays. Have a g o o d Easter, don't
revise t o o hard, a n d please write for felix
