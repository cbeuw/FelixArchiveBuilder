Historic UCL Occupation Victory

O n Friday 19 M a r c h t h e m a n a g e m e n t o f
U C f w e r e forced o n to t h e defensive
over their p r o p o s e d expulsion o f 30 stu-
dents w h o c a n not pay their fees. A pas-
sionate g r o u p o f students o c c u p i e d t h e
Financial Centre o f U C L a n d refused t o
b u d g e until m a n a g e m e n t a g r e e d t o
meet t h e m . A w e e k earlier (12 M a r c h )
approximately 150 students h a d o c c u -
pied t h e financial corridors b r i n g i n g offi-
cial b u s i n e s s t o a g r i n d i n g halt. T h e
occupiers linked arms a n d sat o n t h e
floor in p e a c e f u l d e m o n s t r a t i o n . This
lasted 30 hours, d u r i n g w h i c h t i m e a
high court injunction w a s passed. T h e
o c c u p a t i o n e n d e d w h e n t h e bailiffs
m a d e an entrance with t h e use o f crow-
bars a n d s l e d g e h a m m e r s , d r a g g i n g stu-
dents out o n e by o n e . Despite the threat
of being t h r o w n out o f college, students
maintained their promise not to "resist or
assist" and w e r e carried out by t h e bailiffs.
The latest occupation w a s o n a m u c h
smaller scale, but passions are still run-
ning high. Matt Whltecross, (3rd year
English) w h o took part in t h e occupations
said; "The w a y w e w e r e treated by U C L
m a n a g e m e n t a n d their hired a p e s w a s
absolutely criminal." These t w o pieces o f
direct action have forced t h e m a n a g e -
ment of U C L into a historic concession,-
the Provost, Vice Provost, Registrar a n d
Deputy D e a n have a g r e e d to m e e t with
the students a n d discuss t h e matter face
to face in a m e e t i n g run by t h e o c c u p a -
tion c o m m i t t e e . T h e key objective is a
promise that if a student is unable to pay
their debt t h e n their e d u c a t i o n s h o u l d
not be affected in a n y way.
O n M o n d a y , t h e U C L student b o d y
are d u e to talk to their m a n a g e m e n t
directly. U C L m a n a g e m e n t believes t h e
rumours are a "willful misinterpretation of
university policy totally untrue a n d
without provocation". Their actual policy
is that undergraduates w h o are in debt
shall have "...their examination results
withheld a n d not b e allowed to enter the
next year o f study".
Alex S h a n d ( s e c o n d year M e d i c )
stated "we w a n t t o s h o w UCL m a n a g e -
m e n t that w e are not afraid to stand u p
for our fellow students' ability to learn not
ability to pay".
L o n d o n a n d in particular U C L are
n o w leading t h e battle against student
fees. Both Goldsmiths a n d S O A S w e r e
successful in similar c a m p a i g n s . Signify-
ing that t h e battle is n o w g o i n g nation
w i d e ; N o t t i n g h a m a n d M a n c h e s t e r uni-
versities have contacted the organisers as
they w e r e "inspired" by UCL's action.
As t h e first w a v e o f occupations in
twenty years hits UCL, t h e U C L u n i o n
sabbaticals are all in Dallas. T h e action is
not officiated by U C L U n i o n , resulting in
m u c h anger from t h e activists. The o c c u -
pation c o m m i t t e e consider t h e result a
victory, but a r c not prepared to relax
their fight. It is difficult to conceive of a
h a r m o n i o u s c o n c l u s i o n unless o n e side
backs d o w n completely. In t h e w o r d s of
o n e emotional student, "There is n o c o m -
promise between t h e m , w h o want to run
this university like a business a n d us,
w h o say free e d u c a t i o n is a right"
The pro Rector o f Imperial, Tim Clark,
c o m m e n t e d , " O u r policy Is to deal with
all matters relating to individual students
o n their merits. H o w e v e r m u c h w e may
personally regret t h e charging of fees, w e
are faced with t h e reality that this is n o w
the law o f t h e land. W e have b e e n enor-
m o u s l y Impressed by the responsible
attitude o f IC students a n d have d o n e
what w e can to ease t h e p r o b l e m w h e r e
there is g e n u i n e hardship."
