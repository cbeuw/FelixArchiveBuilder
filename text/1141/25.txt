BLUR
Kevin the cockerel with a few of his less famous
mates: Dave, Alex Graham and that other bloke.
T
hink Beatles, think creativity. O f t h e current
British musical heavyweights,it is Oasis that
have b e e n t h e most blatant in c h a m p i o n i n g
the Fab Four, yet their last t w o a l b u m s possess t h e
inventiveness o f tired-pub-rockers,- m a k i n g music in a
style akin to painting by numbers. It is Blur w h o have
consistently o u t s h o n e their peers in t h e eclectic
stakes; if there is o n e b a n d that represents t h e spirit o f
The Beatles, it's Blur.
The a l b u m starts with Tender, w h i c h you've ail
heard - it even got playlisted o n Radio 2! This sets t h e
subtext for t h e a l b u m , namely D a m o n ' s break-up with
Justine Frischmann. Over dextrous bluegrass guitar
D a m o n preaches t h e uplifting a n t h e m ' C o m e O n !
C o m e O n I G e t t h r o u g h it / Love's t h e greatest t h i n g /
I'm w a i t i n g for that f e e l i n g to c o m e ' . In contrast,
penultimate track No Distance Left To Run finds D a m o n
at his most emotionally w r o u g h t - 'It's over, I k n e w it
w o u l d e n d this w a y /1 h o p e you're with s o m e o n e w h o
m a k e s y o u feel this life is t h e life / W h o settles d o w n ,
stays a r o u n d , s p e n d s m o r e time with y o u / I've got n o
distance left to run' - if you've heard m o r e p r o f o u n d ,
heartfelt lyrics you're mistaken.
In b e t w e e n these t w o s o n g s things get seriously
w e i r d a n d seriously brave. G o n e are t h e social c o m -
mentaries o f Modern Life Is Rubbish, Parklife a n d The
Great Escape; n o w h e r e are there to be f o u n d i m m e -
diate pop-gems like Badheadand Chemical World. The
a l b u m m o v e s o n f r o m w h a t their e p o n y m o u s fifth
a l b u m started; ambitious, all b e it flawed, cosmic music
of raw e m o t i o n . Stand-out tracks 7992, Battle, Caramel
a n d Trimm Trabb convey overtones o f failed love over
sonic s o u n d s c a p e s with startling e m p a t h y - 'But don't
y o u feel low, I w a s b e i n g ugly / Y o u loved m y bed, y o u
got t h e other instead' - 'That's just t h e w a y it is /1 sleep
alone, I sleep alone '
Yet such is Blur's w a n t , Infuriating throw-away
thrashy p u n k a n d needless instrumentals p e p p e r the
a l b u m , d i m i n i s h i n g t h e e m o t i o n a l p u n c h with final
track Optigan I all but destroying the gravitas of No Dis-
tance Left To Run.
Still, a truly r e m a r k a b l e mixed-up, m u d d l e d - u p
record It is a n d divest o f a f e w s o n g s it m a y o f b e e n
the masterpiece Blur u n d o u b t e d l y h o p e d it to be. It's
not quite the last great p o p statement o f the millennium
but it is t h e final piece o f e v i d e n c e in proving Blur to
be t h e c o n t e m p o r a r y British b a n d . C a n t h e rest match
them? I d o u b t It. ESI

HURRICANE #1
Only The Strongest Will Survive
W
ith t h e rise o f N o r m a n C o o k
a n d friends in 1998, t h e m u s i c
industry s a w big-beat surface
as the n e w true face o f Britpop. With a
m o r e upbeat happy s o u n d , party tunes
such as Brimful ofAsha a n d Rockafella
Skank shot to t h e n u m b e r o n e spot.
While t h e f a m o u s battle o f Blur a n d
Oasis faded in t h e m e m o r y , it s e e m e d
that h a p p i n e s s w a s t h e s o u n d in
d e m a n d a n d m a y b e it w a s t i m e for
s o m e o f the o l d Britpoppers t o h a n g u p
their hats.
1999, however, is t h e year t h e o l d
Britpoppers h o p e to hit back. This year
there have b e e n a l b u m releases f r o m
G e n e [Felix 1138], T h e S t e r e o p h o n i e s
[Felix 1138], Blur [This Issue] a n d n o w
Hurricane #1. So h o w are t h e old-boys
going to fair? Well with a f e w n e w tricks,
they shouldn't d o t o o badly. Blur t o o k a
tip from Spiritualized a n d introduced a
choir o n Tender, a n d not l o o k i n g to be
o u t d o n e Hurricane #1 enlisted t h e help
of Unkle f r o n t m a n James Lavelle o n t h e
title track o f t h e a l b u m Only the
Strongest will Survive. With a n array o f
strings a n d a classically Unkle d r u m track
the t u n e p r o d u c e d is H u r r i c a n e #1's
finest to date. There is h o w e v e r a prob-
l e m - i t s e e m s as if this w a s t h e only trick
u p t h e sleeve o f Hurricane #1, a n d as
such t h e rest o f t h e a l b u m d o e s little to
impress.
With a s o u n d m o r e appropriate to a
f e w year's back, a n d a n u m b e r o f songs
not s o u n d i n g unlike those o f songwriter
A n d y Bell's p r e v i o u s b a n d Ride, t h e
a l b u m is m o r e t h a n d i s a p p o i n t i n g .
Rather than b u i l d i n g o n f o u n d a t i o n s .
Hurricane #1 appear to have settled with
t h e m a n d have fallen at the hurdle which
is t h e s e c o n d a l b u m . There are a f e w
m o m e n t s o f brilliance o n t h e a l b u m ,
but n o n e o f these are sustained for long
e n o u g h or properly built u p o n to warrant
a s o n g ' s s e c o n d listen.
So Only the Strongest will Survive is
an a l b u m that is definitely m o r e w e a k
than strong, a n d if only t h e strongest d o
survive, then look out for a n obituary o n
Hurricane #1 s o m e time s o o n . 131

WHISTLER
Whistler
O
kay, so t h e photos o f t h e three
m e m b e r s o f t h e b a n d m a k e
t h e m look d e r a n g e d , retarded
a n d psychotic in that order, but let's
gloss over t h e fact that w e ' r e listening
to a b u n c h o f outpatients f r o m B e d l a m
a n d concentrate o n t h e music.
Inoffensive is t h e first w o r d that
springs to m i n d . Boring is t h e s e c o n d -
all t h e songs s o u n d t h e same. The vocals
are pleasant in a soft English rose kind
of w a y a n d while t h e w h o l e a l b u m is in
the 'pleasant' vein it doesn't m o v e y o u
or provoke a response. N o o n e is g o i n g
to despise Whistler with a passion akin
to that w h i c h I have for Celine Dion or
M i c h a e l Bolton, a n d t h e only p e o p l e
w h o ' l l harp o n about this are those that
still get a b u z z if they stay u p past eleven
o'clock a n d swear. You could almost for-
get it's there. I m e a n if y o u w a n t e d to,
y o u could (wisely ,in m y opinion) switch
it off a n d s e e if a n y o n e notices - a great
g a m e for parties, I'm sure you'll agree.
Actually, scratch t h e pleasant a n d
a m b i g u o u s bit. I've listened to it e n o u g h
times n o w to c o m e t o s o m e c o n c l u -
sions. It's dirge -1 really haven't got a clue
what their a i m w a s in m a k i n g this a l b u m
but it certainly wasn't to entertain anyone
with half a brain. Sure, all their mates
d o w n at t h e institute'H love it but that's
d u e to t h e ever-present fact that it's a
total no-brainer. For God's sake, what sort
of a person p e n s t h e lyric 'Emily I want
y o u to be unhappy, b e u n h a p p y Emily'?
It d o e s g e l with all the other horridly
depressing songs o n the CD, though. O n
t h e s e c o n d listen I c o u l d n ' t d e c i d e
w h e t h e r to h a n g myself, slit m y wrists,
take a f e w t o o m a n y paracetamol or
cap myself a la Kurt C o b a i n . That's all a
little harsh - in t h e e n d I decided that sui-
cide w a s t o o excessive, s o I w e n t to lec-
tures instead. C I
