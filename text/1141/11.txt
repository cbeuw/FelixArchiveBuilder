This week we're got a hotter than hot interview with Chilliblank. They're House and Garage producers with an
amazing double life: they're both Sherfield Security Officers.
People have a t e n d e n c y to stereotype

they drive, or a n y t h i n g else they m i g h t

m a d e , a n d e n c o u r a g e y o u t o think dif-
ferently. This is this situation I w a s faced
with w h e n I met Ajay, a security g u a r d
in Sherfield.
It turned out that as well as k e e p i n g
Imperial the fortress that it is, h e leads
an a m a z i n g d o u b l e life as o n e half o f

my red u n d e r p a n t s b e f o r e I c o m e in t o
college!" he jokes, as w e sit in the U n i o n
with his partner in c r i m e D a n , w h o also
works in security. It's t h e v e n u e that
they're g o i n g to be playing at w h e n t h e
Carnival c o m e s into t o w n o n Friday.

"The people I was deal-
ing with were cowboys,
they were only in it for
the cred, because it's
dangerous."
"We w e r e o n at eleven last year a n d
w e thought it was a bit early, but w e got
there a n d t h e r o o m w a s e m p t y . W e
started playing a f e w tracks a n d t h e
r o o m filled out." They s e e this type o f
events as b e i n g important to t h e d e v e l -
o p m e n t of their music: "It's g o o d for us
as w e can play our stuff out a n d s e e
what kind o f reaction w e get. It's not
about h o w y o u can try a guitar, or h o w
y o u c a n s i n g . It's a b o u t p l a y i n g t h e
music, playing it loud a n d s e e i n g w h a t
reaction y o u get f r o m it."
Ajay got into t h e s c e n e t h r o u g h
Dan, w h o was already m e s s i n g about o n
his decks at h o m e . H e did s o m e stuff
o n pirate radio stations, b u t w a s n ' t
impressed: "the p e o p l e I w a s d e a l i n g
with w e r e c o w b o y s , they w e r e only in It
for the cred, because it's dangerous." H e
therefore c h a n g e d direction a n d l o o k e d
m o r e towards p r o d u c t i o n . " M o s t kids
w e r e l o o k i n g at Playboy" Ajay says, "but
w e w e r e l o o k i n g through Future Music."
This was until o n e day .that they d e c i d e d
t o get s o m e e q u i p m e n t t o g e t h e r a n d
t h i n g is totally faceless" Dan observes "if
y o u m a k e m o n e y commercially then d o
it- t h e n y o u can f u n d other personal

H o u s e a n d G a r a g e , putting their influ-
e n c e s t o g e t h e r t o p r o d u c e their o w n
u n i q u e style: "We're getting our o w n
style together, it's evident in the music.
If w e p l a y e d

early tracks a n d

music, but also
a b o u t g o o d
t e c h n i c a l abil-
ity." They admit
to b e i n g quite
early in their
d e v e l o p m e n t
as a n outfit:
"we're just
l e a r n i n g o u r
t r a d e . W e ' r e
just putting it out as little pieces that
w e ' v e d o n e s o p e o p l e can recognise
our p r o d u c t i o n talent." A n d they cer-
tainly d o have talent. Despite not hav-
ing put out any w h i t e labels yet, they
interests." They currently p r o d u c e their
music by reconstructing a track a r o u n d
a s a m p l e d vocal. Sampling is b e i n g used
by m o r e a n d m o r e acts across g e n r e s
n o w a d a y s , but still s o m e criticise it as
b e i n g unfaithful t o the original artists.
Surprisingly, Dan is m o r e than s y m p a -
thetic to their point of v ie w "using other
peoples vocals,
alright it's like
\ V. stealing, but at
the s a m e t i m e
w e ' r e not mak-
ing any m o n e y

just l e a r n i n g
our trade." It's
a situation that

s u p p o r t Chilliblank, they s i m p l y don't
have the t i m e or m o n e y to d o it. H o w -
ever, they see a way out of this vicious
cycle. "There's always ways to get m o n e y
if y o u w a n t it. The proper next step for
w e r e a s k e d to d o the m u s i c for a radio
advert for Sprite. But wouldn't they con-
us w o u l d be to put out a w h i t e label o f
just two or three of our tracks; put it out,
sider this to be selling out? "That kind o f a n d see w h a t h a p p e n s . I h e first t h i n g
w e put out, w e want to be bad. W e want
it t o d r o p w h e n p e o p l e c o m e in. I'm

"You can use Imperial to your advantage

self. The inspiration side o f it is pretty

it doesn't give y o u m u c h inspiration."
They are m o r e u p b e a t a b o u t the music

away with any success "We're not out to
