Wellcome Update
Felix is finally able to bring y o u the truth
o n the r u m o u r e d sale o f the St Mary's
c a m p u s [Felix 1137]. A l t h o u g h the alle-
gation w a s initially c o n f i r m e d by a very
senior figure in t h e M e d i c a l School, it
w o u l d n o w s e e m to b e c o m p l e t e l y
untrue. As Professor M a l c o m e G r e e n
explained in Issue 1138, St Mary's is to bid
to receive substantial backing f r o m the
Wellcome Trust - the prospect o f w h i c h
has been greeted by all those concerned
as very g o o d news for a c a m p u s w h o s e
future had always b e e n uncertain. Fresh
rumours suggest that the Glaxo allega-
tions w e r e circulated as part o f an o n
going power struggle a m o n g s t certain
higher echelons o f ICSM - however, Felix
is unable to c o m m e n t o n the validity o f
such suggestions, a n d apologises to Pro-
fessor G r e e n for not c o n t a c t i n g h i m
before r u n n i n g t h e story.
The Tiger Bites Back
O n e o f South Ken's better k n o w n land-
marks, the sign outside t h e Paper Tiger
restaurant, w a s r e m o v e d by students a
f e w w e e k s a g o , a n d b r o u g h t back to
rince's Gardens. The restaurant's o w n -
ers failed to s e e t h e f u n n y side o f this,
however, a n d t o o k legal a c t i o n .
Although the matter w a s settled out
of court, t h e students Involved have
b e e n ordered to pay costs o f a r o u n d
£1600. It is believed that College will not
be taking a n y further disciplinary action.
Capitalism Contested
O n Thursday 11 M a r c h Imperial's Envi-
ronmental Society held an event in dBs,

(ICC), an organisation o f activists f r o m
diverse g r o u p s a r o u n d t h e w o r l d w h o
are organising a n international day o f
action aimed at the heart o f global e c o n -
omy; the financial centres, b a n k i n g dis-
tricts a n d multinational corporate p o w e r
bases. The day in q u e s t i o n is June 18,
a n d UK activities are b e i n g organised by
Reclaim t h e Streets, s o it s h o u l d b e

Drop-out Depression
N e w HEFCE figures have revealed that
around a quarter o f full-time d e g r e e stu-
dents in English institutions d r o p o u t
before c o m p l e t i o n . The figures e x c e e d
previous calculations having taken into
account students w h o transfer courses.
There is great variation b e t w e e n the var-
ious institutions as the figures are highly
d e p e n d e n t o n factors such as the A-
Level grades o f the intake a n d w h i c h
courses they run; medicine, for instance,
has a particularly high rate of completion.
The figures are s o m e w h a t surprising
although d o not place England in the t o p
ten table, w h i c h is h e a d e d by Italy with
a drop-out rate of over sixty percent.
Cruelty-Free Lurve

well as their conscience, thanks to the

press release that "the p r o c e s s i n g o f
latex in m a n y c o n d o m s involves casein,
a milk protein". V e g a n s avoid all sub-
