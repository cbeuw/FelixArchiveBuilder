Bic Hayes (middle). Is he related to
Brett Anderson?
T
hree former m e m b e r s o f t h e less than well
k n o w n Levitation have got back together to
f o r m t h e entity called Dark Star. They are gain-
ing exposure rapidly a n d will u n d o u b t e d l y b e c o m e
m o r e popular than Levitation ever w a s t h o u g h admit-
tedly this a c h i e v e m e n t doesn't take m u c h d o i n g .
The Water Rats is a n apt n a m e for Dark Star's
v e n u e , a n a m e to attract London's seedier residents,
and t h e b a n d m e m b e r s , Bic Hayes (vocals), Dave tran-
colini a n d Laurence O ' K e e f e fit t h e bill perfectly.
Fairy lights that are usually only seen during Christ-
mas adorn the m i c r o p h o n e stands a d d i n g a bizarre
t o u c h to the stage. Is this t h e first sign o f Dark Star's
gothic tendencies? Looking around at the crowd tonight
there c o u l d be a fair a m o u n t o f d i s a p p o i n t m e n t if
they d o g o d o w n t h e goth route.
There is relief all round as they steer clear o f this
path a n d kick o f f with t h e ferocious endless rush o f
thrashed out guitar noise k n o w n as I Am The Sun. Bic
Hayes makes t h e use of t w o mics to create t h e ethe-
real ghostly effect o n t h e chorus, with lines like 'She
said Jesus w a s m y a g e w h e n h e got nailed / I'm c o m -
ing back to y o u , I'm paranormal'. Fantastic.
About 3 am follows next, initially deceiving t h e
c r o w d into believing that they're listening to a ballad,
that is, until t h e point w h e r e t h e guitars rip in a n d pro-
d u c e an uplifting angst-ridden masterpiece. At times
they can sound like Blur (but only slightly mind you) with
the Oohs and ahs p o p p i n g u p in t h e b a c k g r o u n d ,
especially s o o n What In The World's Wrong.
Bic Hayes slight frame betrays t h e p o w e r o f the
s o n g s a n d t h e pent-up anger that underlies each o n e .
Dark Star thankfully avoid s o u n d i n g like a metal band
and m a n a g e to fuse a variety of influences to p r o d u c e
a bass heavy distorted s o u n d s c a p e that, if it existed,
w o u l d b e placed into a n e w category o f music k n o w n
as 'pre-millennium angst'.
O n t h e six minute epic, Graceadelica d r u m m e r
O'Keefe shows that he's multi-talented as he starts shak-
ing a maracas a b o u t a n d g o e s o n to u s e it o n the
drums. M a d .
There is always a pervading sense o f oppression
o n nearly all t h e songs, but Bic Hayes' passive exterior
lifts s o m e of this c l a u s t r o p h o b i a a n d delivers in equal
measures, leisurely s h o e g a z i n g a n d a lethal distorted
attack, d

UNDERWORLD BETH ORTON
Beaucoup Fish Central Reservation
I caught one THIS big!
U
nderworld. They'll p r o d u c e an
a l b u m , they'll release a f e w sin-
gles a n d then they'll disappear
for a c o u p l e o f years. T h e n , they m a k e
a c o m e back by r e l e a s i n g a n o t h e r
a l b u m ( h o p i n g that no-one's forgot
them) a n d so it b e c o m e s a n ever pre-
dictable pattern.
Their latest a l b u m is Beaucoup Tlsh,
and (sadly) it is n o t h i n g that w e haven't
heard before. The a l b u m is the b o g -
standard kind o f music that w a s o n t h e
last a l b u m , w h i c h is a s h a m e as y o u
w o u l d have thought that Darren Emer-
son et al might have c h a n g e d a little bit
musically, m o v i n g forward with t h e times
so to speak. But sadly U n d e r w o r l d s e e m
to have got themselves stuck in a rut
with Beaucoup Fish. This latest offering
gives us eleven tracks, including Cups,
Moaner, Push Upstairs a n d er... Push
Downstairs.
C o m p a r e d to t h e last a l b u m Sec-
ond Toughest In The Infants this o n e is
not that different, but if y o u like Under-
w o r l d or haven't h e a r d their m u s i c
before then this is definitely worth check-
ing out. As usual, the d e e p bass lines are
there In all t h e tracks a n d t h e vocals
s o u n d like those that w e r e in Born Slippy
with that strange robotic s o u n d to t h e m .
The tracks last a n a g e a n d n o d o u b t
most o f t h e m will find their w a y into t h e
clubs. But it's n o t h i n g to shout about
a n d y o u get t h e impression that Under-
world have b e c o m e t o o lazy, predictable
a n d dare I say it - boring. The techno-
h o u s e s o u n d s that w e r e exciting a f e w
years a g o have n o w b e c o m e t h e n o r m ,
so this a l b u m doesn't stand out a n d y o u
just feel like pressing t h e forward button
t w o minutes before the e n d o f the track.
It's a bit s a d a n d disappointing because
as DJs U n d e r w o r l d are u p there with t h e
best. It's a pity that musically they haven't
d e v e l o p e d . Beaucoup Fish isn't that b a d
an a l b u m but it's plain a n d o n c e you've
heard o n e track, you've heard the w h o l e
a l b u m . EH

Beth Orton - mates with the Chem-
ical Brothers, aren't you jealous?
T
his is Beth's s e c o n d a l b u m after
the critically a c c l a i m e d Trailer
Park w a s released in late 1996.
In t h e intervening period she's b e e n
having a g o o d time - from w o r k i n g
with her al! time hero, folk-jazz l e g e n d
Terry Callier to s i n g i n g o n t h e The
Chemical Brothers' n u m b e r o n e a l b u m
Dig Your Own Hole, to p e r f o r m i n g to a
packed-out tent o f 10,000 m u d d y
Glastonbury-goers.
This a l b u m is full o f m o r e of t h e
great chilled out soulful s o n g s with intel-
ligent, heart r e n d i n g lyrics that m a d e
Trailer Park so successful. It's Beth's voice
that really makes this a l b u m - she has just
the right kind o f voice that c a n sing
these lyrics a n d get away with it - not like
Alanis Morisette w h o always c o m e s off
as just b e i n g lame, in m y o p i n i o n . Her
w o r k with t h e C h e m i c a l Brothers a n d
others s e e m to have h a d a n effect t o o .
There are lots m o r e beats o n t h e a l b u m
especially o n Start all seem to weep - a
very Portishead-esque, trippy track.
What Beth has m a n a g e d to d o is
blend s o m e great lyrics a n d back it up
with s o m e solid tunes to g o with it. It's
hard to say really w h y this a l b u m works
so well - it just does. Perhaps because it's
so refreshing that Beth hasn't sold out to
a big music corporation a n d kept to her
roots a n d t h e small label s h e originally
s i g n e d with - refusing t h e doubtless mil-
lion offers of big contracts with even big-
ger labels. G o o d o n y o u Beth -1 wish a
f e w m o r e artists w o u l d take a leaf out of
her b o o k a n d stick to music not cash.
Anyway, e n o u g h o f m y ranting, o n with
the review.
Standout tracks for m e are Sweeresf
Decline - a delicious pianos a n d violins
n u m b e r with s o m e heavenly vocals from
Beth, t h e title track with s o m e great
acoustic guitar w o r k and Couldn't Cause
Me Harm - blissed o u t vocals a n d s o m e
ace ' i m p r o v i s e d ' h u m s a n d has. Lovely.
This is a n o t h e r g o o d a l b u m from
Orton - great for chilling out o n a Sunday
a f t e r n o o n a n d ripe for s o m e great
remixes f r o m her mates the Chemicals
a n d others. E3
