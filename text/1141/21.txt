Pleasantville * *
Starring : Tobey Maguire, Jeff Daniels, Joan Allen, William H Macy, J T Walsh, Reese Witherspoon
Director: Gary Ross
In the words of Rolf Harris, 'Can you tell what It Is yet?"
Y
ou could s u m u p Pleasantville in six
words: nice idea, s h a m e about t h e
m o v i e . H o w e v e r , a half-page
review requires that I explain w h y for t h e
next 400 words, so...
Pleasantvllle is Happy Days m e e t s
The Truman Show •. a sanitised, bottled
look at fifties life, given a neat Truman-
e s q u e slant by inserting t w o nineties
teenagers into its clean-living world - a n d
although it might s o u n d decidedly silly o n
paper, t h e magical journey o f M a g u i r e
and Witherspoon into their TV isn't really
the problem. The real c h e e s e (and w e ' r e
talking Harrods stilton here) lies in their
s u b s e q u e n t actions. Y o u s e e , whilst
Maguire is a geeky, TV o b s e s s e d freak,
w h o ' s entirely happy with a black & white
existence, W i t h e r s p o o n is a flirty, o u t g o -
ing nineties-child, w h o takes advantage of
every break s h e gets. So before a n y o n e
realises what's g o i n g on, the town's teens
have d i s c o v e r e d sex. A n d slowly start
m o v i n g into colour.
The true cliche then arrives in the bat-
tles w h i c h b e g i n b e t w e e n t h e teens a n d
the adults - or t h e coloureds a n d non-
coloureds, as t h e m o v i e insists o n calling
t h e m . O h dear, t w o cliches for t h e price
of o n e . But, as if that wasn't e n o u g h ,
there are s o m e bizzare scenes o f mass
book-burning w h i c h a r c trying so hard to
b e symbolic that it hurts. Moreover, by
m a n a g i n g to tie in every class, race or
g e n d e r struggle o f t h e fifties, director
Ross treats n o n e o f t h e m with a n y
respect.
That said, however, it's not all b a d .
M a c y a n d Allen turn in g o o d perfor-
m a n c e s (as ever) as the teenagers trou-
bled parents - a n d Jeff Daniels is curi-
ously off-beat as t h e o w n e r of the town's
malt s h o p (like a n y stereotypical fifties
t o w n , everyone b e t w e e n the ages o f 12
and 20 hangs o u t drinking milkshakes
and eating cheeseburgers). Most impres-
sive o f all, h o w e v e r , a r e s o m e o f t h e
effects. Ross a n d his cinematographer,
John findley, w o r k with special effects t o
s h o w a black-and-white world in w h i c h
s o m e things a n d a f e w p e o p l e b e g i n
switching t o colour, p r o d u c i n g changes
w h i c h a r e s o delicately d o n e that y o u
hardly notice they're there - w h i c h is a
s h a m e considering that Pleasantville actu-
ally contains m o r e effects shots than any
previous m o v i e .
N o n e t h e l e s s , y o u can't help but
laugh at the movie, rather than with it. The
attempts at satire a n d social c o m m e n t a r y
fall flat, largely because t h e issues that
w e r e risque in t h e fifties n o longer inter-
est or fascinate a c i n e m a audience. The
real sadness, however, lies in t h e fact
that you c o m e a w a y almost 1 0 0 % certain
that this story could have b e e n m a d e
into a g o o d film...a real s h a m e . O
