John Avery
'Once I Had It All, Now I Just Have Every-
thing'
(Liquid Records)
S o m e a l b u m s a r e w e i r d a n d n o t
w o n d e r f u l . In fact, most o f t h e s e s o
called 'experimental' a l b u m s are a load
of bollocks a n d a waste o f m o n e y . But
this a l b u m by John Avery is weird, w o n -
derful a n d o f high quality - it's a very
'Future S o u n d o f L o n d o n ' type a l b u m .
There are tracks w h i c h s o u n d like they
should be o n the soundtrack o f s o m e sci-
fi movie such as ' O p t i m o City' whilst oth-
ers are m o r e funky a n d d o w n b e a t such
as the title track. Yet still, tracks such as
'Blipvert' a n d 'The N i g h t t h e Rain
S t o p p e d ' are eclectic. It's a fantastic
a l b u m , f u s i n g m a n y different s o u n d s
a n d crossing m a n y genres, s o m e t i m e s
creating a h a u n t i n g a t m o s p h e r e a n d
s o m e t i m e s a down-beat chilled s o u n d ,
a n d y o u don't k n o w what t h e next track
will s o u n d like m a k i n g it very u n p r e -
dictable. All t h e tracks have b e e n writ-
ten, p e r f o r m e d a n d p r o d u c e d by John
Avery a n d he's taken t i m e to p r o d u c e a
quality a l b u m . It's g o o d to s e e (or rather
hear) s o m e o n e taking time to p r o d u c e
g o o d quality experimental s o u n d s with-
out m a k i n g a twat o f themselves.

Flex 13
'Paint My Legs'
(Liquid Records)
Similar to t h e J o h n Avery a l b u m
w h i c h is not surprising since it's also o n
Liquid Records. A g a i n , a very experi-
mental a l b u m with a range o f music,
f r o m down-beat a n d funky to industrial
a n d eclectic such as 'Burning Arms', a n d
in the case o f 'Schizophrenic Lover' a jazz
track with a hint of country music whilst
'Give M e Wings' provides a s l o w groove
tune. Musically very o p e n m i n d e d a n d
very experimental, it is different to t h e
Avery a l b u m , but doesn't have t h e s a m e
e d g e . Worth listening to at t h e record
store before buying, t h o u g h I prefer t h e
John Avery a l b u m . Strange but g o o d .

Vengaboys
The Party Album'
Everyone's heard their first t w o sin-
gles 'Up and D o w n ' a n d 'We like to Party'.
C h e e s y a n d irritating d a n c e singles that
t e e n a g e r s u p a n d d o w n t h e country
b o u g h t a n d sent t h e fucking things to
the t o p o f the national charts. N o w t h e
Vengaboys inflict their a l b u m o n us. The
rather sadly titled T h e Party Album' is, sur-
prise surprise, c o m p l e t e a n d utter crap.
All t h e tunes s o u n d exactly t h e s a m e
a n d it w o u l d b e a brave person w h o
m a n a g e d to listen to t h e w h o l e thing
f r o m start to finish. Very c o m m e r c i a l ,
very Euro-house, very teeny-bopper
s o u n d i n g - I'm sure y o u get t h e picture.
I g u e s s if s o m e o n e out there likes the
V e n g a b o y s then check t h e a l b u m out,
otherwise avoid like t h e plague.

Avla
'Avia EP'
(Catalogue)
This is another a l b u m f r o m a t o p
Frenchman, Pierre Avia. That part o f t h e
world has really b e e n g e t t i n g it's act
together recently. This EP c o m b i n e s t h e
best e l e m e n t s o f s o m e truly chilled-out
jazz and s o m e great breakbeats too. The
first track has b e e n described as "floaty
house" -1 a m not quite sure w h a t that
means but it certainly h a d m e chilling.
Great jazz beats a n d trippy keyboards o n
this o n e .
'Rebirth' is next, with m o r e of the
s a m e blissed out keyboards a n d a great
s a m p l e with a g u y relating his ills to the
world, w h e n s u d d e n l y a great African-
style beat w h i p s in. It really gave m e a
start t h e first time I played it! T h e d r u m -
m e r o n this track, artificial or not, is very
skilled. A s s o o n as the drums j u m p in,
they j u m p out, to b e replaced by s o m e
funky guitar action, then they all c o m e
back together. Not fast e n o u g h for m c ,
but a g o o d track for chilling o u t to
n o n e t h e l e s s .
The next track 'Exil Exit' has s o m e
nice Neil A r m s t r o n g samples a n d m o r e
great d r u m breaks. As
far as I a m c o n c e r n e d
any s o n g w h i c h uses
s p a c e y s a m p l e s gets
the t h u m b s u p !
The final tune o n
this great EP is
'Flash/Flashback' - this
little tyke m a n a g e d to
convince m e that m y
C D player h a d b r o k e n .
You s e e it starts with a
c u n n i n g loop of t h u n -
der a n d a piano s a m p l e -1 w a s sure t h e
it w a s trashed. But sure e n o u g h after a
while a wicked junglish beat slams in. All
in all a great EP for chilling with. G o o d
w o r k Pierre!

T e l e p o p m u s i k
T e l e p o p m u s i k EP'
(Catalogue)
A n o t h e r b u n c h o f Parisians m a d e
this EP - a trio of producers m a k i n g their
C a t a l o g u e records d e b u t . T h e s e guys
must have picked u p a church o r g a n o n
the cheap or s o m e t h i n g , because il is
featured heavily in this EP, a n d t o great
effect admittedly.
Track one, 'An Ordinary Life' starts off
with a scary sample f r o m s o m e b o o k
w h i c h I can't quite r e m e m b e r . It's quite
dark - with great Indian drums helping to
set t h e m o o d . It builds u p to a crescendo
of beats a n d then breaks out into b o o m -
' i n g organ. Groovy.
Next u p is ' S o m e t h i n g A b o u t G.A.'
Starts off with s o m e guy, w h o appears to
c a t a l o g u e
be having a very weird conversation with
a n information line operator for s o m e -
t h i n g called G.A. - w e never find out
w h a t this illusive G.A. is. Still, w h o cares
- with beats as large as this the conver-
sation doesn't matter. It all g o e s very
mental very quickly with rapid drums
a n d s o m e w i e r d little girl samples. Nuts.
M o v i n g o n t o ' S o m e t h i n g Else (G.A.
Remix)' this is a n Indian twist o n an
already funky tunc. Great percussion -
a n d that insane little girl again. I think I
prefer t h e remix to t h e original - it's a lit-
tle bit m o r e u p beat a n d cheery a n d
there is n o t h i n g w r o n g with that, n o w is
there?
A n d finally...with Track 4 'A Life Less
O r d i n a r y (Remix)' t h e beats just get
faster. Very Prodigy s o u n d i n g this o n e -
with sirens, c h o p p e d beats, a n d 808s.
W i c k e d . M o r e g o o d w o r k from Ihe con-
tinent.
