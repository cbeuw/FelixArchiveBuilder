Little did the poor Sims know what disasters awaited them .
...Fire and tornados were Just the start...heh heh heh
"We want water! W e w a n t power!" I c a n
hear p e o p l e calling. With a quick call to
my engineers, they w e r e i m m e d i a t e l y
rushed to find out w h a t can b e d o n e t o
remedy t h e situation. Crime rate rising in
Sector 4? Never m i n d that, a police sta-
tion will take care of that. Fire unchecked?
What the hell are m y firefighters doing?
Probably loafing o n t h e j o b again. Just
wait till they
have a taste o f
my wrath.
W h o e v e r
says that life as
the mayor o f
Ronnyville is a

my city is a vir-
tual o n e , I
quickly realized
that mayors are

w o r l d . SimC-
ity3000 (SC3K)
lets y o u have a
go at r u n n i n g a
city o n your
o w n , t h e w a y y o u w a n t it. From t h e very
start, SC3K lets y o u c h o o s e your o w n
terrain f r o m a list of f a m o u s cities, includ-
ing Sydney, H o n g Kong, M o s c o w a n d o f
course g o o d old L o n d o n . In fact, y o u can
actually try to fashion your ideal L o n d o n
b a s e d o n its geography. I Bet I could d o
better than t h e i n c u m b e n t city planner,
eh?
Buildings-wise, your city c a n b e
m a d e as artistic as Paris - having m u s e -
u m s a n d arches everywhere, or by pack-
ing it full o f skyscrapers (which includes
the world's tallest building, t h e Petronas
Towers) - claim it as your very o w n N e w
York.
Aspects o f city d e v e l o p m e n t y o u can
m e d d l e in i n c l u d e transportation a n d
power. Y o u plan s u b w a y lines a n d bus
routes d o w n to point w h e r e y o u decide
w h e r e to place bus-stops. You can also
select t h e type o f p o w e r g e n e r a t i o n
m e t h o d to b e a d o p t e d by your city. As
your simulation runs further d o w n
the timeline, y o u get to build m o r e
a n d m o r e a d v a n c e structures like
nuclear, solar, microwave a n d even-
tually f u s i o n p o w e r plants. O f
c o u r s e , t h e m o r e high-tech t h e
energy source, t h e less y o u have to
worry about pollution.
Talking about pollution, o n e fea-
ture that is n e w to SC3K is t h e n e e d
to deal with rubbish. Sad, but it is a
fact of life. Cities, e v e n ideal o n e s
like mine, still churn out garbage
that has to be disposed safely. Land-
fills s h o u l d be a v o i d e d if possible
since they devalue your land a n d keep
tax-paying Sims, your citizens, away. If
y o u can afford it, construct Waste-To-
Energy Incinerators. These devices effec-
tively convert waste into energy. C o o l
concept!
O f course, m o n e y makes t h e w o r l d
g o e s round a n d y o u n e e d to b u d g e t
your finances well if y o u d o not w a n t t o
leave t h e city bankrupt a n d get kicked
out o f your office. Fortunately, there is a
t e a m of advisors to aid y o u in city plan-
n i n g a n d m a n a g i n g taxes. They c a n
prove remarkably valuable w h e n your
city grows b e y o n d w h a t y o u can effi-
ciently control alone. g
What I particularly like about I
SC3K is its disaster option. If y o u i
feel really bored waiting for t h e |
tax revenues to roll in - doesnt |
everyone o n c e in a while, try let- I

if y o u don't w a n t your city reduced to

over.
Essentially SC3K is a brilliant a n d
highly c o m p l e x g a m e , yet d e s i g n e d with
simple interfaces to e n a b l e easy m a n -

cessful predecessor SC2K.

Competition Corner
Championship Manager 3 : The Final Table
N o w this o n e w a s a real b u g g e r . Perhaps I h a d overestimated t h e football geekiness level at Imperial..but like life, everything
turned out all right in t h e e n d , a n d s o m e o n e m a n a g e d (sorry I p u n n e d ) to get all seven celeb fans with t h e correct clubs.
These w e r e :-
1. Eddie Jordan - Coventry City 2. Nigel Kennedy - Aston Villa 3. Zoe Ball - Manchester Utd.
4. Jasper Carrot t - Birmingham City 5. Hugh Grant - Fulham 6. Jo Whiley - Northampton Town
7. John Motson - Barnet
The semi-finals
James Martin 2 - 7 S i m o n N e w t o n
Peter Daplyn 5 - 7 A n d r e w Hilsdon
The final
James Martin 7 - 7 A n d r e w Hilsdon
( A n d r e w Hilsdon w o n o n penalties)
It's never nice to s e e a p e r s o n lose o n penalties but if James Martin wants to claim a HydrothunderT-Shirt f r o m t h e office h e
can pick it u p n o w . A n d r e w c a n c o m e into t h e office too, but he'll have to wait until Eidos deliver the prize.
