impossible goal - to truthfully cap-
ture the shades, tones, m o o d s a n d

exhibition c o m e near to scoring while

the photos in this exhibition are certainly
interesting, this d o e s not m a k e t h e m art

Is t h e f u n d a m e n t a l difference b e t w e e n
simply taking a picture a n d m a k i n g a
p h o t o g r a p h .
There are s o m a n y different subjects
a n d styles in this exhibition that it is
largely a n impossible task to c o m p a r e
o n e p h o t o to another. That said, every
single o n e o f t h e pictures w a s safely
conservative. Disturbingly, y o u c o u l d
h a n g a n y o f t h e m in t h e Rector's office
without causing m u c h o f a stir (maybe
this w a s t h e ideal). Is n o o n e out there
e x p e r i m e n t i n g even with simple tech-
niques like scoring a n d painting n e g a -
tives or manipulating t h e m with a c o m -
puter?
Holiday photographers will tell y o u
that y o u n e e d f o r e g r o u n d interest, back-
g r o u n d d r a m a a n d s o m e t h i n g quirky to
attract attention. In this sense, abstract or
still life p h o t o g r a p h s are difficult to d o .
Abstraction m a y b e a d a n g e r o u s g a m e
for amateur p h o t o g r a p h e r s to play, but
it really is essential t o take that risk occa-
sionally. While I wasn't entirely sure of t h e
originality a n d t h e point o f Kelly
A n d r o u t o s p o u l o s ' m o n o c h r o m e images
of h u m a n feet, at least they still remain
in m y m i n d .
M a y Lee's Blue in all its s h a d e s also
stands out. It w a s a dramatic p a n o r a m a
of misty c l o u d b a n k s over m o u n t a i n s .
This w a s certainly beautiful a n d w o u l d
merit s o m e c o m p u t e r e n h a n c e m e n t to
realise its truly abstract potential. Indeed,
c o m p u t e r e n h a n c e m e n t is s o w i d e l y
used today by major y o u n g p h o t o g r a -
phers that it surprised m e to s e e that n o
o n e had e x p e r i m e n t e d with it. If s o m e -
one did use the computer, please forgive
m e for t h e oversight!
Another tenet o f insightful p h o t o g -
raphy is to k n o w s o m e t h i n g about your
subject. In this way, Grandma and Ma by
Aki Naito w o r k e d . The p h o t o g r a p h can-
didly captured a m o m e n t o f intimacy
and shared it with us. Such skill is the hall-
mark o f a talented photographer.
The Old Man ofStorrby Ottilie Dyke
was a striking m o n o c h r o m e depiction
of a m o n u m e n t a l rock tower. This could
have b e e n taken by t h e f a m o u s Cali-
fornian landscape p h o t o g r a p h e r Ansell
A d a m s , w h o d i e d 15 years a g o . A d a m s
m a d e pictures o f Yosemite a n d other
national parks a n d Dyke is clearly fol-
lowing in his p i o n e e r i n g footsteps. Dyke
o b v i o u s l y u n d e r s t a n d s that c a p t u r i n g
grades o f s h a d o w is t h e key skill in dra-
matic black a n d w h i t e photography.
I w a s not entirely sure w h y Aimee by
Leonie T h o m p s o n (pictured) w a s c h o -
sen as t h e w i n n i n g photograph in a c o m -
petition running alongside the exhibition.
M y winner w o u l d have b e e n Sonu, m a d e
by Jagvinder Singh C h a n d h a . This w a s a
poignant black and white shot of a young
child p e e p i n g over a wall, into t h e lens
of t h e c a m e r a . In t h e b a c k g r o u n d , w e
see a n apparently Third World environ-
ment of rubble a n d poverty. This is clearly
d o c u m e n t a r y art, but it is also p h o t o -
journalism, dispatched from the frontline
with a n important story to tell. I r e c o m -
m e n d y o u g o a n d s e e this story, but
d o n ' t expect a n y t h i n g e v e n remotely
experimental.

TROILUS AND CRESSIDA
Royal National Theatre, Olivier
T
roilus and Cressida is t h e latest pro-
duction by the a c c l a i m e d Shake-
speare director Trevor N u n n . This
epic play is not to be sneezed at, and with
a length of almost four hours it is not light
entertainment, even t h o u g h at times it is
very comical.
A l t h o u g h o n e o f Shakespeare's less
frequently performed plays; it is regarded
as a brilliant satire o n the state, a n d a skil-
ful deflation o f t h e Greek heroes, por-
traying Achilles as a boastful coward a n d
the eventual Greek victory over the Tro-
jans as essentially dishonourable. A c o m -
edy, tragedy and history at once, since its
first publication 1602 it has avoided defi-
nite categorisation.
The play starts during the siege o f
Troy, in the bitter a n d drawn out war over
Helen, daughter o f the g o d Zeus a n d
o w n e r o f t h e original face that launched
a thousand ships. She has been snatched
by t h e Trojans from her Greek husband
king M e n e l a u s a n d t h e e n s u i n g struggle
for her recapture results in a war that has
dragged o n b e y o n d all expectations.
We join events at the point w h e r e the
Greeks, in their c a m p outside the city's
walls, are b e c o m i n g d e m o r a l i s e d a n d
the Trojans are b e g i n n i n g to question
the legitimacy of their stance a n d their
ability to endure the siege. The sense-
lessness of a war over o n e w o m a n is tak-
ing its toll.
Despite b e i n g t h e namesakes o f t h e
play, t h e story o f Cressida a n d Troilus is
played d o w n , while the emphasis is most
definitely placed o n war and its (im)moral-
ity. Very little is seen of t h e pair falling in
love a n d n o sooner d o they get together
than she must be h a n d e d over to t h e
Greeks. W h e n Cressida breaks her oath
of loyalty to Troilus, she is never really for-
given, a n d n o reconciliation (or even an
attempt at it) is made. You arc very aware
that the w h o l e play is part o f a m u c h
larger picture, w h i c h c a n m a k e it s e e m a
little unresolved.
Despite b e i n g central to the plot,
H e l e n hardly a p p e a r s a n d t h e single
scene in w h i c h w e s e c her s h o w s her
almost oblivious to the w h o l e affair. A l o n g
with Cressida's faithlessness, a n d t h e
insanity of Troilus' sister, you could be for-
given for thinking that Shakespeare w a s
not f e e l i n g particularly sympathetic to
w o m e n at t h e time.
However, Cressida is by n o means
u n t h i n k i n g or unintelligent a n d w h e n
first h a n d e d to t h e Greeks s h e defends
herself entirely with her wit. S o p h i e
O k o n e d o ' s portrayal o f her (pictured)
gives her extra sass, perhaps a d d i n g a
slightly i n c o n g r u o u s air of modernity.
Despite occasional overacting t h e
cast were, without exception, lively a n d
spirited a n d all turned in brilliant perfor-
mances. They s u c c e e d in m a k i n g a very
long a n d potentially very confusing story
interesting, a n d brought out t h e h u m o u r
excellently.
The c o s t u m e s a r e elaborate a n d ,
along with dramatic lighting, give a lavish
feel, d e s p i t e t h e minimalist set. The
Olivier theatre really is a lovely place, a n d
gets t h e a t m o s p h e r e just right.
