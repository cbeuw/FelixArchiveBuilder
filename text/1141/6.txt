We've Lost Some Letters...
Dear Readers
Several (hand written) letters, due for
publication In this Issue, were mislaid In
the course of perparlng Felix this week.
Please would anyone who submitted a
letter which does not appear below
accept my apologies - If you want It pub-
lished In the first Issue of next term, I
would be happy to accept It any time
before noon on Wednesday 21 April.
There was one letter from 'marc'
which raised a few points, outlined
(hopefully correctly) below,-
Dear Ed,
I submitted an article for publication
in last week's issue concerning an Envi-
ronmental Society event in aid of the
Inter Continental Caravan (ICC), a group
which is organising a day of action
against the financial and business centres
of the world. I was annoyed to see that
you didn't publish it, but yet there was a
review of the FJust-A-Gut comedy night in
the news section.

Stand Up for Yourself!
Dear Editor,
In reply to the letter sent for this issue
[Felix 1140] by D. Ray, I would like to
express my feelings on this subject. If a
candidate standing for hustings does
not have the temerity to stand up to a
few simple questions, then should they
be standing at all? Like some story from
the days of ancient Rome this candidate
appears to have Mr. Ray as a shadowy fig-
ure slyly representing them from behind
the scenes (with the candidate's express
knowledge and presumably full bless-
ing). Perhaps the candidates could speak
for themselves in the future as would be
required If they were to take up a post
within the student union. Or perhaps
the Mandy of IC, Mr. Ray (also a friend
of mine), could stand for the post him-
self?

Glaxo-Wellcome Query
Dear Editor,
I read with some interest your riveting
report some weeks ago that ICSM was
selling a number of floors of the St Marys
site to Glaxo Wellcome. It was indeed
a fascinating story. I also read with the
same interest Professor Green's rebuttal
the following week, and your equally

stout rejoinder that Felix's sources were
reliable, and that the following week we
should all be learn the real state of affairs.
I am sure that I am not your only
reader to be so disappointed that, since
then, nothing has appeared in Felix
about this remarkable scoop. Does this
mean that our Medical School has not
made £20 million out of Glaxo Wellcome?
It's all extremely disappointing, i do hope
you can enlighten me.
Yours sincerely

I Luv My Jugs
Have any of you seen my jug ? It was last
seen on Friday 5th March at precisely
11:06 pm in the Union with the gentle-
man above [photo Included, which I'm
not printing without more Information -
Ed] If you have any info on the bloke in
the snapshot or any information on the
whereabouts of the jug, please contact
me on 0345 48 49 50. Please help me
find it and lets bring rogues like him, to
book. By the way I do love my jugs.

plastic ones used on Cocktail nights In
DaVIncl's. Can anyone tell me what this
is all about? - Ed

I had no problems with printing the arti-
cle, we simply ran out of space. As for
why the comedy review was printed
Instead, 250 people attend the comedy
nights, which Is probably more than
attend EnvSoc meetings (although I
admit I don't have any figures). ICU Is
one of the best student unions In the
Comedy Network, and 1 feel this should
be brought to readers' attention. How-
ever, I hope the mention given to the
EnvSoc/ICC meeting In this Issue makes
up for our former omission. - Ed
Having read your review of Shadow
Dancer and being acquainted with the
book itself I would like to bring to your
attention two main points: People in
West Belfast are called Paddy, Gerry etc.
What else do you expect them to be
called? The plot may be slightly thin and
contrived but surely the fact that this has
happened in real life on a number of
occasions (most notably the middle of
the 70s) is a testament to British Justice
rather than an author lacking in Ideas!
