In k e e p i n g with t h e g o d s o f sport w h o
have b e e n smiling o n Imperial this year,
the hockey firsts have w o n t h e Premier
League a n d the L o n d o n C h a l l e n g e C u p .
For t h e s e c o n d year running, Hol-
loway duly s h o w e d for their t o k e n c u p
appearance. Immediate domination w a s
n e e d e d to put these boys in their place.
If short corners w e r e s p o n g e s , w e could
have soaked u p allthe beer spilt o n Fri-
day night but our failure to convert t h e m
eased the pressure o n Holloway. T h e
mighty Morrell o p e n e d t h e s c o r i n g with
a direct penalty flick. A n d y a n d Paul h a d
glorious games, running rings a r o u n d all
and sundry. O ' D e a ' s goal has already
b e e n s n a p p e d by the EHA for their next
textbook. James kept a solid midfieid
ticking over with Keylock laying it d o w n
c h a m p a g n e style in their left c h a n n e l .
Fluke a n d M r . M a n g l e s stifled a forward
play d o w n their wing, resulting in t h e first
injury o f t h e day, a n d s o m e irate c o m -
ments to t h e ref. Superb link-ups from
Fluffy provided m u c h enjoyment for the
crowd, unfortunately not so m u c h for the
f e m a l e s . Tim's sliding tackle compli-
m a n t c d a solid d e f e n c e led by Hillbilly
Thorton, with skipper M a y c o c k dishing
out A-tcam style hassle to their roving for-
wards. At h a l f t i m e t h e scorelin rested
at 3-0. With the arrival of the original roc-
keeter, B. Collen, the g a m e pace d o u -
bled, but o u r increasingly f l o w i n g
attacking style allowed a slip in marking
a n d t w o unlucky goals for t h e Beach
Boys. N o t to be o u t d o n e , Sweater Har-
ris ran, dived a n d danced his way into the
far D. In true JCB style, T r u e m a n put a
finish to o n e such run and gave slight dis-
omfort to t h e queasy supporters with a
g l o w i n g white lard-free backside. A n d
w h e r e w o u l d w e have b e e n without the
adaptability of N o d d y Thomas, ably filling
in at left back d u e to injuries. Unboubt-
edly this has b e e n the best hockey the
Harlington turf has seen in years. Con-
gratuations to M Williamson for his Eng-
land call u p ; w e got y o u there!

a l l o w e d Chris " M e g a " Dickinson to slot
in a penalty, m a k i n g t h e score 10-5 to IC
at t h e halfway mark.
By n o w , b o t h packs w e r e really
b e g i n n i n g to feel the heat. T h e furious
running g a m e o f the first twenty minutes
was lost as both packs settled d o w n to
a long, drawn out slugging match. The
break for IC c a m e twenty minutes into
the s e c o n d half, with o p e n s i d e flanker
Dan I ligazi s c o r i n g a brilliant o p p o r -
tunistic try of t h e back o f an opposition
scrum. The IC t e a m could sense victory
now, but there w a s still plenty of work to
be d o n e as G K T g a m e back d e t e r m i n e d
not to g o d o w n without a fight.
With t h e referee playing w a y over
the 80 minutes normally allowed for a
g a m e o f Rugby, GKT had put u p c a m p in
the IC half. After a series o f hard scrums,
GKT finally m a n a g e d to break our line to
score the last points of t h e g a m e . With
the score at 15-10 to IC, a n d after 94 min-
utes, t h e referee b l e w t h e final whistle.

Having beaten UCL, St G e o r g e s a n d the
Imperial M e d i c s o n our w a y through t h e
UL Cup, w e w e r e finally to meet GKT in
the final. W e k n e w that they had put u p
an excellent fight against ICSM in the U H
C u p final a n d w e r e definitely not to b e
underestimated. They'd w o n their first
division league a n d h a d thrashed the
likes o f U C L a n d Portsmouth.
The g a m e started with Imperial
being, quite frankly, crap. Within 5 m i n -
utes, GKT h a d o p e n e d t h e scored sheet
with a soft try in t h e corner. D a z z e d a n d
c o n f u s e d , IC k n u c k l e d d o w n to w h a t
was obviously g o i n g to b e a fight to t h e
finish. Within minutes, s o m e aggressive
play f r o m t h e IC pack h a d put Imperial
d e e p into the GKT half. T h e ball w a s
s h i p p e d o u t t o A n d y M a y e s , w h o ' s
strength s h o w e d as h e penetrated their
line to score the first points for Imperial.
