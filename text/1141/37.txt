VOLLEYBALL
One of the best in the country
After qualifying for t h e first t i m e ever t o
the final national BUSA t o u r n a m e n t , ICU
Volleyball has o n c e again m a d e t h e col-
lege proud. It all started last friday, with
a train trip to f o u g h b o r o u g h , w h e r e t h e
final tournament w o u l d take place. U p o n
arrival, w e quickly realised that this tour-
nament w a s s o m e t h i n g m o r e than 'just'
the BUSA finals, since representatives o f
the English national t e a m s w e r e there
scouting for t o p athletes. O u r t e a m w a s
greeted with a 'where are y o u from?' a n d
'do y o u actually k n o w h o w to play vol-
leyball in London?' type o f m e s s a g e s .
W e just smiled politely. W e k n e w they
w o u l d have to swallow all o f that in t h e
end. W e just k n e w it!
O u r first match w a s o n friday. W e
played Sheffield, a sports university w h o
call themselves Sports Elite S q u a d (yes!,
that is actually what they have written o n
the back o f their tops!). They w e r e c o n -
sidered by everybody as t h e 2 n d best
t e a m in t h e t o u r n a m e n t a n d w e got t h e
i m p r e s s i o n they d i d n ' t c o m e t o this
match as well prepared as they c o u l d
have d o n e . Big mistake! IC started t h e
g a m e In a n u n s t o p p a b l e f a s h i o n . Super-
man Carlo a n d Crazy N i c o s w e r e attack-
ing powerfully, a n d m a d e e v e r y b o d y
realise w e w e r e there to w i n ! What a dis-
play o f skill! W e beat t h e m by 2-0, smiled,
a n d w e n t back to t h e hotel for s o m e rest
(more like partying actually).
O n Saturday w e played D e Mont-
ford University. They w e r e a quality side
a n d h a d beaten in t h e qualifying stages
the current titleholders. Again, w e w e r e
s u p p o s e d to loose this o n e as well. But
guess what? W e proved t h e m w r o n g ! A
fantastic t e a m effort, with t h e usual sus-
pects Carlo a n d Nicos, s h o w i n g every-
b o d y they w e r e t h e best attackers in t h e
t o u r n a m e n t w a s e n o u g h to s e c u r e
a n o t h e r success, this t i m e with a 2-1
score. With this result, w e qualified auto-
matically for t h e semi-finals. H e n c e , t h e
result o f the last match w a s o f n o impor-
tance, a n d s o m e of the reserves c a m e in
to have s o m e fun. W e played Edinburgh,
the weakest t e a m in tournament, a n d in
the e n d , w e lost t h e match 1-2. But n o
d a m a g e w a s d o n e , since 1st place in
the g r o u p w a s already secured. At t h e
s a m e time, w e g a i n e d valuable support
for t h e 3 rd day since t h e loud Scots w e r e
pretty grateful for t h e fact that w e didn't
play o u r first t e a m a n d gave t h e m a
c h a n c e to fight for a result. Are w e nice
p e o p l e or what?
finally, o n Sunday (after s o m e wild
partying d u r i n g t h e night), semi-final
against Cambridge. By this stage, p e o p l e
w e r e already asking us w h e n w e w e r e
playing our matches since they w a n t e d
to s e e our players in action. W e started
badly a n d lost t h e first set. But t h e n , w e
putted o n a gutsy p e r f o r m a n c e a n d
turned t h e match a r o u n d beating t h e
o p p o n e n t s by 2-11 It w a s a fantastic feel-
ing! W e w e r e in t h e national final! What
an achievement! At t h e s a m e time, three
of our players (Carlo, Nicos a n d Michael)
w e r e invited to play for t h e National Eng-
lish University t e a m . What a n h o n o u r !
The final w a s a b i g affair, with c a m -
e r a m e n o n stand-by to record the s h o w -
d o w n , a n d reporters m a k i n g interviews.
Our o p p o n e n t s , Sheffield Hallam, w e r e
n o t h i n g less than t h e English School o f
Volleyball Excellence. These are athletes
w h o get scholarships to g o into a sports
university a n d d o n o t h i n g else but play
volleyball. They train daily, play in t h e
national premiership a n d half o f t h e m
are m e m b e r s o f t h e English national
squad. W e fought hard, very hard actu-
ally, a n d w e had t h e m scared at s o m e
stage (the crowd w a s actually g o i n g wild
with t h e prospect o f s e e i n g a n almost
'professional' side b e i n g beaten by a
b u n c h o f e n g i n e e r i n g students). H o w -
ever, in t h e e n d , w e couldn't pull-it o f f
and lost 0-2. Volleyball Is a team-sport a n d
our top players could not make-up for the
lack o f high-level team-practice. At t h e
s a m e time, Carlo (aka Superman) had a
bad injury (or w a s there a n y Kriptonite
around?) a n d w a s not able to perform at
his peak (he also spent 3 days distribut-
ing autographs, w h i c h must have tired
him).
W e finished in t h e runner-up spot,
with t h e notion that w e w e n t b e y o n d
everybody's wildest dreams. ICU Volley-
ball is n o w o n t h e m a p a n d we'll try to
keep it in that w a y in t h e future. That's
w h e r e w e b e l o n g , f i g h t i n g for t h e
national title. W e also have to thank to all
our supporters w h o w e n t a l o n g with us.
Thanks guys, y o u w e r e great! A n d finally,
a special thanks to M i n g , w h o played the
w h o l e t o u r n a m e n t injured, a n d Panos
(Sports Personality o f t h e Year) for his
'professional' organisation of t h e w h o l e
thing. N o n e o f this w o u l d have been pos-
sible otherwise.
SEASON REVIEW: RIFLE CLUB
The year started well for the Rifle a n d Pis-
tol Club with an influx of keen n e w m e m -
bers w h o really m a d e their impression o n
the club.
The first competition o f the year w a s
the Southern Counties Archery C o m p e -
tition. Three o f our archers m a d e their
way to Brunei, a n d putting in a g o o d per-
formance to set t h e trend for t h e year
c a m e away with creditable scores, o n e
of t h e m Leonora Lang (soon after m a d e
archery captain) c o m i n g a w a y with t h e
Bronze m e d a l .
Not to b e out-done by t h e archers
the Rifle t e a m got set for t h e West Kent
League. This c o m p e t i t i o n is e n t e r e d by
the s o m e o f t h e very best shots in t h e
country; the g o o d news is s o m e o f those
people are in our club. A n excellent per-
formance (including a m a x i m u m 100)
by A n d r e w Eldridge s a w h i m c o m i n g
fourth overall, although this w a s a closer
result than it sounds, h e w a s only o n e
point away f r o m w i n n i n g , t h e result w a s
decided o n re-gauging!
As t h e year progressed t h e standard
of s h o o t i n g increased steadily, several
shooters f r o m IC w e r e called u p to t h e
hallowed ranks of t h e U L Rifle T e a m ,
notably S a m Sharpe only in his first year
here. There w e r e m a n y f u n s h o o t s
throughout t h e year, with ou r m e m b e r s
going to Bisley and various Clay-Shooting
v e n u e s - g o o d times w e r e h a d by all.
While all this w a s g o i n g o n there w a s
always t h e IC league to c o m p e t e in; this
is t h e Clubs internal c o m p e t i t i o n c o n -
sisting of 34 cards to shoot. The standard
this year w a s very high, reflecting t h e
prestigious nature o f t h e c o m p e t i t i o n .
Excellent p e r f o r m a n c e s f r o m Phil Golds,
A n d r e w Eldridge a n d S a m Sharpe have
m a d e it very tight; t h e final result is still
p e n d i n g .
February m e a n t t h e BUSA Clay
p i g e o n championships, four teams from
IC m a d e their w a y to Hull a n d shot well
o n t h e day having a lot o f fun, positions
in t h e t o p half o f the score table for t w o
o f the teams s a w t h e m g o h o m e happy.
M o r e recently L e o Lang put in a
superb PB p e r f o r m a n c e at t h e National
Recurve C h a m p i o n s h i p s , w i n n i n g t h e
BUSA trials, a n d c o m i n g third in t h e
head-to-head c o m p e t i t i o n . This set her
well o n t h e w a y to b e c o m i n g a m e m b e r
of t h e British Student Squad.
No t aliens to t h e G B t e a m t h e m -
selves t h e U f rifle t e a m w e n t to Sutton
Coldfield for t h e Inter-University Small-
b o r e C h a m p i o n s h i p s . T h e t e a m c o n -
tained 6 out of 10 IC m e m b e r s a n d as
such t h e result w a s never in doubt - yet
another w i n !
The year is n o t over yet, however;
the holidays s e e the start of the full-bore
season w h e r e m o r e Imperial victories
are sure to b e h a d .
FENCING
Reading Novice Eppe Tournament
Despite s o m e hitches in t h e m o r n i n g
w h e n o n e third o f our three m a n t e a m
nearly didn't show, a glitch w h i c h w o u l d
have meant disqualification a n d a n early
bath for Imperial, w e m a n a g e d to m a k e
it to t h e T o u r n a m e n t just in time to face
the City A t e a m . With c o n s u m m a t e skill
w e s a w t h e m off with a s o u n d thrashing
a n d then p r o c e e d e d to d o exactly the
s a m e with both Herts a n d Kent Univer-
sity, ensuring that w e w e r e s e e d e d a n
u n e x p e c t e d but entirely gratifying sec-
o n d . By n o w t h e smell o f victory w a s in
the air, s o m u c h s o that w e d e c i d e d to
f o r g o o u r traditional lunch-time drink
just in case o u r f e n c i n g skills w e r e
impaired.
Rested, w e entered t h e direct elim-
ination r o u n d a n d quickly d i s p a t c h e d
the City A t e a m w h i c h pitched us u p
against Hull A in t h e quarter-finals.
Despite their initial a p p e a r a n c e s Hull
p r o v e d n o m a t c h f o r o u r c o m b i n e d
efforts a n d w e f o u n d ourselves in t h e
semi-finals. This w a s against Exeter a n d
turned out to b e our first t o u g h match.
W e f o u n d ourselves trailing half way,
h o w e v e r t h a n k s to s o m e a g g r e s s i v e
scare tactics f r o m John 'needs a b o x '
Lung w e m a n a g e d to even t h e score.
This w a s f o l l o w e d u p by s o m e classy
timing a n d a f e w choice m o v e s by Alex
' O n e pint will hurt' Griffin m e a n i n g that
w e entered t h e last fight in t h e lead. All
that w a s r e q u i r e d w a s t h e d e a d l y
patience a n d pin-point accuracy o f John
'foreplay' Claeys to beat Exeter 45-42.
The final t h e n w a s Imperial vs t h e Keele
A t e a m w h o had w o n t h e foil t h e previ-
ous day. T h e match started well with
our t e a m m a n a g i n g to k e e p level, h o w -
ever by n o w w e w e r e tiring a n d Keele
just s e e m e d to have t h e e d g e , despite
a last spurt by 'Foreplay' w e lost 41-45
and just h a d to settle for silver.
The w h o l e event was. very enter-
taining a n d w e returned h o m e a n d to
the p u b clutching our medals with pride.
A n y o n e interested in fencing should
g o a l o n g to the union gym at lunchtimes
o n M o n d a y or Friday.
