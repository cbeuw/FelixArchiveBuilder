THE WHOLE WOMAN
by Germaine Greer
G
ermaine Greer is f a m o u s all over
the w o r l d f o r o n e b o o k , The
Female Eunuch. It w a s written 30
years ago a n d w a s a d e f i n i n g m o m e n t in
the first steps of Feminism. Since then she
has continued writing a n d teaching in
several universities, a l t h o u g h s h e is n o w
based at Warwick University.
Greer has c o m e t o t h e conclusion
that it is time t o get angry again. S h e
doesn't think that F e m i n i s m h a s
answered all the questions a n d solved all
the problems. She therefore d e c i d e d t o
write a n e w book, The Whole Woman. It
takes o n a t r e m e n d o u s a m o u n t o f topics,
"women take all
the blame and
have no control"
ranging f r o m w o m e n ' s bodies t o their
relationships with m e n , children a n d par-
ents. The b o o k is terribly interesting a n d
has a strong energy about it. The pro-
motion o f t h e b o o k m a y a p p e a r very
mass orientated. Greer has d o n e this
deliberately - s h e has said herself that
there Is n o other w a y to d o it in this time
and age.
O n T u e s d a y 16 M a r c h , G e r m a i n e
Greer appeared at t h e Royal G e o g r a p h i -
cal Society to talk about her b o o k a n d her
ideas in g e n e r a l . T h e a u d i e n c e w a s
mainly c o m p o s e d o f w o m e n , with t h e
o d d m a n here a n d there. After b e i n g
introduced, Greer started talking - it w a s
captivating. She is a natural speaker a n d
s e e m s very used t o it. Her e l o q u e n c e
was inspiring a n d her intelligence just
radiated. She began by mentioning some-
o n w o m e n ' s feelings towards their o w n
bodies. She then m o v e d o n to generalise
about h o w w o m e n are m a d e to live in
fear by clever marketing strategies a n d
thing that is very close to her heart - t h e
way w o m e n have b e e n reacting to breast
cancer a n d t h e lack o f proper screening
for it. She also m a d e general c o m m e n t s
h o w they "take all the blame and have n o
control". Her arguments w e r e very c o n -
vincing a n d s h e is a pleasure to listen to.
Her short talk (only half an hour) w a s fol-
lowed by a question a n d answer session.
This w a s e v e n m o r e c o m p e l l i n g since
s o m e people w e r e trying to catch her out
and w e r e asking very difficult things. But
she w a s ready for it a n d her natural flow
was even more impressive. The exchange
was very fruitful a n d included c o m m e n t s
about transsexuals a n d disabled individ-
uals as well as major issues that she raises
in her book. Greer s h o w e d that s h e w a s
i n d e e d angry a n d that things had not
c h a n g e d all that m u c h since t h e 60s but
she did warn w o m e n that they should not
be in a "hurry". Feminism is still in its
early stages a c c o r d i n g to her. To e n d the
"it is time
to get angry
again"
evening, s h e did a b o o k signing, which
lasted for ages. W h e n w e finally got to
her, t h e friend I w a s with asked a ques-
tion. It w a s great to actually talk to her and
share just a f e w minutes with her.
Greer is an a m a z i n g orator a n d her
b o o k is really worth t h e read. She has put
F e m i n i s m back o n t h e a g e n d a , e v e n
t h o u g h s o m e very g o o d literature has
b e e n published in the past f e w years. This
is t h e next step o f t h e battle that lies
a h e a d for w o m e n o f t h e 21st century.

SKIN AND BONE
by Gareth Creer
A
rtie's sure that his wife,
M a d e l a l n e , is h a v i n g
an affair. H e ' s also
struggling t o keep his fish-
m o n g e r ' s s h o p g o i n g in
t o w n , a l t h o u g h he's t h e last
b u s i n e s s left o n t h e H i g h
Street a n d property develop-
ers want him out. There's sim-
m e r i n g g a n g warfare o n t h e
estate w h e r e his mother lives,
a n d his friends are embroiled
in it. Overall, he's not d o i n g
t o o well.
Skin and Bone is a grimly
realistic portrayal o f urban
degradation, o b s e s s i o n a n d
betrayal. O n t h e other h a n d ,
It's surprisingly optimistic a n d
Artie is a s y m p a t h e t i c , if
flawed, character. The story
follows Artie's attempts to w i n
back his wife a n d break out of his situa-
tion. In his path are ties o f b l o o d a n d loy-
alty, and the sinister criminal activities that
s e e m t o involve e v e r y o n e . I f o u n d it
hard to put d o w n , right u p to t h e s o m e -
w h a t abrupt a n d u n e x p e c t e d e n d .
It's a bit of a strange book, to be h o n -
est, but well written a n d w o r t h c h e c k i n g
out. Everything is narrated by Artie, both
as it h a p p e n s a n d as a seties o f m e m o -
ries, recalled to illustrate a point. I'm not
normally f o n d o f first person, present
tense writing like this, but here it adds
Intimacy a n d e n h a n c e s t h e reader's
empathy with the narrator, without being
annoying. The plot is fast-moving, intense
a n d gripping. There's a sense o f moral
ambiguity a n d an almost hopeless opti-
m i s m , w h i c h give t h e b o o k a slightly
'unusual feel.
The strength o f the characterisation
is o n e o f Skin and Bone's highlights.
Despite t h e possibly biased viewpoint
d u e to everything b e i n g s e e n through
Artie's eyes, t h e o t h e r characters a r e
c o m p l e x personalities with their o w n sto-
ries a n d motives. Artie himself develops
into a n i n d e p e n d e n t , intelligent a n d
surprisingly heroic character, consider-
ing that h e starts t h e b o o k c h e c k i n g
M a d e l a i n ' s h a n d b a g a n d k e e p i n g a card
database o f her possible lovers.
This is Gareth Creer's first novel, a n d
it's pretty d a m n g o o d . It m a n a g e s t o
w e a v e together t h e plot o f a reasonable
thriller with a t a n g l e d w e b o f love a n d
deceit. N o t a b o o k t o read t o your chil-
dren (the usual graphic sex a n d violence
is a little m o r e personal here), but o n e
that'll m a k e y o u think.
