SEASON REVIEW: IC VI FOOTBALL
IC 6ths, what a season! Today's cancel-
lation by RAM and the three points
picked up on Saturday on a mud bath of
a pitch against GKT IV give us 31 points
this season, ensuring us of a top five fin-
ish and possibly even greater.
This achievement did not seem pos-
sible at the start when we were still with-
out a point after our first three games,
the fixtures computer matching us up
against the eventual high fliers in our first
four games, and with such an inexperi-
enced, injury hit team we found it hard
going.
The first milestone for us was a point
against the eventual champions (in all
probability) and two games later the first
win followed, a 5-3 battle royale against
Barts in which player of the season Tom
Wilson secured his first hat-trick and next
year's captain Mike Nikolich made his 6th
team debut. Before Christmas a further
three points was taken in a game
notable for the emergence of Alex as a
midfield superstar and a goal of the sea-
son contender from Supersub Raby. IC
6ths were finally upwardly mobile.
In the New Year spirits were raised,
and following a tight 3-2 home win In the
league, our assault on the cup could
commence. Despite the absence of the
defensive pillars that are Tom and Oz,
the developing partnership of Booth and
Wilson up front, together with the con-
tinental influence of Giret (having
returned from injury in midfield) inspired
a 7-1 victory over UCf VI, a team one
league higher than ourselves, with Booth
collecting a hat-trick and Williams and
Raval scoring their first goals for the
team, the latter a superb team effort.
The real test was in the next round
against 4th division Q M W IV. Stifling
the game in midfield, we almost pulled
it off, two sublime breakaway goals from
Tom "the Doc" not quite enough to over-
come the three scored against us,
though "Big Al" was unlucky to see his
header strike a post near the end.
So we were now free to concentrate
on the league, and a great run of seven
victories out of nine has seen us climb
from nowhere to the heady heights we
now occupy, with the side developing all
the time, suggesting even greater things
are to come next year. Despite 14-1, 8-
1 and 5-0 victories during the spring
term, game of the season has to be the
4-2 smash and grab job down at Berry-
lands against the enemy that is Kings VI.
An unbelievable "backs-against-the-wall"
display looked like it would secure a
well-earned point with the score at 2-2.
That was until Tom and Spinning Top Roy
weaved their magic, one with an orbit-
entering lob over the keeper, the other
with a piss-taking run, the likes of which
man has never seen before, destroying
the opposition, jaws dropping in awe as
it finished 4-2. And we almost missed the
game thanks to Mike not liking cheese
on his Big Mac.
Apart from all this the season has
also seen a number of friendly games
played, mostly for a reserve team that will
form the basis of a 7th team next year.
Also, Tom bagged his 7th hat-trick of
the season today, playing for the 5ths,
and this should secure him the top-
scorer's Golden Boot for the whole of the
London League, his tally now having
reached 32, with an extra three in the
cup.
Apart from him, I would like to thank
everyone who has played for me this
year and has made it such a pleasure to
captain the team. Roll on Sllwood Park
(Saturday) and see you all at the trials in
October.

HOCKEY: DISCO SQUAD
It's the reigning men. Hallelujah!
ULU Reserve Cup Final
Disco Squad 3
ICSM II 1
We have gone all the way. What can you
say? What words can embody the joy of
the disco squad. Class, style, skill, beers,
mates. Rezoole Inzuman-ul Haque,
Tommy Cuntle, Cheesey, Bob Pyle lain
Pyle, El Capitano, Baps, Peter Tong,
Chrissy Bull, Ashrafulah Haque, Marky
Blackmore, Mad McAtar Murphy, Fabio,
Casanova (walks on water) and Jim Tay-
lor. These are the names of a bunch lads
who have just been raised to a higher
plane. The grass smells sweeter, the sky
looks bluer, beer tastes of the summer
sun. As I stand here on the balcony of
Motspur park bar the cool air of the
evening flows past me and all is good in
the world.
The match Itself was full of drama.
The Sundance Kid pulled a bit of magic
out of his hat after 5 minutes: went
around 4 of the opposition and deftly
planted the ball In the back of ICSM's net.
This first goal put some of the fear of the
Sun Medallion into the medics and we
knew we couldn't have got off to a bet-
ter start. St. Marys weren't the friendliest
side we'd ever played, and the entire
opposition did a good impression of
Nora Batty with PMT whenever the ref
gave a decision our way.
We kept on top of the game
throughout the first half and had a seem-
ingly constant stream of short corners,
before fABIO clipped in a sweet strike
into the bottom left hand corner.
Although we had but 6 supporters, their
chants were by now drowning out the
teeming hoards of medics that had
turned up to watch their side being
shown what skillful hockey really looks
like.
Half time was full of fire and we
knew then that we were going to win.
The second half was tense. St. Marys
somehow squeezed one past the mighty
Tong with ten minutes gone and they
wete back in the match. Both teams had
good chances, but the Sundance Kids
skilful runs were all to often ended by
blatantly unskilful barges, but our goal-
poast (of Joy) did its job and kept out a
huge St. Marys strike. We put together
some moves that would have had John
Travlota gaping in awe. With three min-
utes to go, Fabio collected a rebound
and shot from the top of the D. Some of
the crowd was on the pitch - they
thought it was all over. As the ball flew
into the Marys goal and the backboard
disappeard in a cloud of dust and splin-
ters we all knew it was now. 'Nuff said.
DISCO. See you next year.
Season review: DISCO SQUAD
We have all been part of the best season
that the DISCO SQUAD has ever seen.
We have won the Cup and dominated
the league, winning promotion If not the
league itself.
The key to understanding the DISCO
SQUAD is that although we're winners,
and we've gone all the way - we've
had a laugh doing it. Our success is due
to team spirit rather than skill. That the
DISCO spirit has reigned throughout the
season is a monument to the founda-
tions on which this team is built.
The nature of our team-spirit build-
ing In the showers after the game has
been dubious to say the least - mainly
thanks to a certain Flltrum - who can
spot a dropped soap at a thousand yards.
Who are we? Tossers? No. Wasters? No.
We love hockey, we love beers and If we
met you, you'd probably love us.
Hasta Luego - its been a good one.
C&G FOOTBALL-THE FINAL
A Very Civil affair!
Civ. Eng...
Elec Eng..
As the sun beat down on Hyde Park, two
teams of highly trained, ultra-fit sports-
men faced each other across the muddy
pitch. This was it - the final, make or
break, winner takes all. Tunde, the elec-
trical coach and referee for the day
tossed the coin; civils called heads and
won the kick-off.
They lost no time in exerting pres-
sure on the sparks' goalmouth. Alex
'Zachacrapalot' was viscious in attack,
putting in some thumping shots, expertly
saved by some superb keeping. 'Lone
ranger' Druve was a rock in defence,
tackling hard and frustrating the best
efforts of Brad 'the Bucket' Baskett to get
his name on the score sheet. The frus
trated civils
kept the pres-
sure on so
much that
they forgot
about
defence alto-
gether. Rocky
and Bassa
started some
great breaks
and panicked
the d e f e n c e â„¢
on more than | p |
one occasion,
but with John
between the posts the civils felt reason-
ably safe. Eventually, though, pressure
from Paul and Alex supplied Brad with a
goal, not before time.
A few wild tackles and strongly
worded
exchanges
later, Elec Eng
took advan-.
tage of a terri-
ble, but sadly
not atypical
defensive
error from lain
and grubbed
the ball over
the line past
the scrambling
John. Then it
was halftime.
The game
could have gone either way. The sparks
had their defence regimented, almost
shoulder to shoulder. Suddenly, though,
out of the blue, Brad shot a rocket past
the keeper and the brickies had the lead
again. Heartened by this they rallied and
Brad had another - that makes 15 goals
in three matches. Pretty good eh?
The electricals fought to the bitter end
but the day belonged to the bridge
builders.
When we lifted the cup and read the
engravings we were continuting a thirty
year domination of this event by civil
engineering. It last ran from '69 to '72,
with civil teams winning each year. It
must be rare In any sporting contest for
any team to have a 1 0 0 % record for thirty
years. If you ignore the 27 year uncon-
tested gap.
Thank you to the organisers (C&G
Union) and everyone who played and
came out to support. It's been a success
this year, let's hope it'll be even better
next year. lain
