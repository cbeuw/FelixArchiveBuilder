Mystery prize
As Waterstone's have decided that Â£10
a week is just too much for their oh-so-
delicately-balanced budget, Felix has
decided to sposor its own crossword. The
first correct entry pulled out of the not-
so-virtual hat will receive a mystery prize
(almost certainly a pair of film tickets)
