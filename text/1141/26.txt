LIAM HOWLETT
Prodigy Presents the Dirtchamber Sessions Volume One Â£
'Excuse me mate, you haven't got a
spare flrestarter, 'ave ya?
I iam Howlett is t h e brains b e h i n d this mix a l b u m ,
La n d t h o u g h at first it appears bizarre that o n e of
the Prodigy's m e m b e r s has d e c i d e d to mix a
truckload o f his 'favourite' tracks, it really is n o differ-
ent f r o m a recognised Dj's release. So d o e s this a l b u m
give all those Prodigy fans out there a clue to their
influences a n d inspirations? The answer Is a straight-
forward yes. Liam has e v e n Included t h e track that pro-
vided t h e m with t h e concept for Smack My Bitch Up,
a n d if y o u didn't k n o w already, it's the Ultramagnetic
M c ' s Kool Keith Housing Things.
There are nine tracks in total a n d within each o n e
y o u are taken o n a journey through a mix of over five
songs, a n d Liam's mixing skills are t o p notch. N o c o m -
plaints there. H e has b e e n a busy bloke over t h e last
f e w years a n d n o offence intended but his a g e d o e s
s h o w o n his choice o f tracks. There's a w i d e spread o f
musical styles, ranging from early '80s 'old skool' scratch-
ing with the likes o f the Ultramagnetic M C ' s classic Give
The Drummer Some to t h e present day with Primal
Scream's excellent Kowalski. Liam also delves further
back into t h e past with offerings f r o m t h e Sex Pistols
with New York and further guitar based tracks are float-
ing a r o u n d including The Charlatans' How High a n d
Jane's Addiction's Been Caught Stealing. Nevertheless,
the majority o f t h e record is based o n early hip-hop
n u m b e r s such as The Beastie Boys' Time To Get It a n d
JB's Blow Your Head.
There is such a diverse range o f musical tastes o n
this a l b u m , a n d will probably a p p e a l to most open-
m i n d e d Prodigy fans, a n d for t h e real trainspotters it
may even e n c o u r a g e p e o p l e to search a r o u n d for old
copies o f these tracks o n vinyl.
The a l b u m title hints at a f o l l o w u p a l b u m , maybe
a different Prodigy m e m b e r might try their hands at the
decks. Start q u e u i n g for t h e next o n e ! H

URBAN SPECIES
Blanket|
Urban Species - it's where It's
hat, kids.
U
rban Species are a three-man
unit - M i n t o s (the voice) a n d
R e n e g a d e (producer) all b a c k e d
up by Doctor Slim - that have received
wide spread acclaim for their brand o f
intelligent rap. First s i g n e d u p w a y back
in 1993 by Giles Peterson's Talkin' Loud
Label, they w e r e immediately releasing
singles that w e r e getting praise f r o m all
areas of t h e m e d i a , DJs a n d e v e n m e .
Their d e b u t a l b u m Listen w a s a
diverse set c o v e r i n g a w i d e range o f
musical genres, extending rap b e y o n d its
normal boundaries. Their c o m b i n a t i o n o f
live m u s i c m i x e d with s a m p l e d beats
and rhymes w a s impressive a n d refresh-
ing. N o w after four years o f a f e w w h i t e
labels but pretty m u c h n o t h i n g at all,
their s o p h o m o r e set is d u e for release.
Blanket has b e e n a l o n g time d u e
a n d at last a copy o f it hit t h e Felix door-
mat. The a l b u m o p e n s up with Changing
Of The Guard-a thoroughly provocative
n u m b e r with a lovely jazzy under beat
that starts t h e a l b u m off with a little kick.
Next up is Destructive - it starts o f f slow
but quickly picks u p as t h e drums kick in,
the lyrics are hard a n d t h e chorus is a
s t u n n i n g d o u b l e act b e t w e e n M i n t o s
and a beautiful female voice. As it started
Destructive finishes as t h e beats are
taken out a n d a worryingly stormy piano
riff breaks in. Following o n f r o m Destruc-
tive is m y favourite t u n e Blanket. It's
quite simply a s t o u n d i n g - a hauntingly
dark p i e c e with t h e most electrifying
slide action to close it out. / Wonder is a
little skit that has b e e n e x t e n d e d into a
full track; its funky with a catchy chorus
that makes y o u want to hear it again a n d
again.
Urban Species take a look at life with
every track. N o n e m o r e than o n t h e
eerie Religion & Politics w h i c h is a look
at what religion a n d politics really are. The
lyrics are eye o p e n i n g a n d t h e overall
style is hard to categorise as o n e thing
or another as they use m a n y musical
styles to f o r m a distinct a l b u m that can
only be described as class. EJ

SKUNK ANANSIE
Post Orgasmic Chill E
Pre-orgasmlc thrills all round.
A
s the a l b u m kicks off y o u w o u l d
be mistaken to think that Skunk
Anansie's s o u n d has taken a
m o r e break-beat tone since their alter-
native-ish Paranoid And Sunburnt. You'll
probably have heard t h e first single o f f
the a l b u m , Charlie Big Potato - currently
in the charts. Skin's unmistakable vocals
are still as lavish as ever a n d the rhyth-
mic guitars take a while to sting unlike
the radio edit w h i c h hits y o u straight
away. The beats o n this track last only a
very short w a y into the a l b u m .
Skunk Anansie really d o m a k e t h e
most of the 'explicit lyrics' warning, g o i n g
all out with t h e f-words in On My Hotel
TV. I guess they didn't appreciate t h e
w i d e c h o i c e o f porn c h a n n e l s t h e n -
they appear to be very a n n o y e d with
people 'Fucking o n my hotel T.V. / Private
hotel T.V.'
As t h e a l b u m progresses, it defi-
nitely loses t h e beats, e n d i n g up with the
typical s o u n d y o u w o u l d expect f r o m
S k u n k A n a n s i e . Tracy's Flaw d o e s n ' t
impress in t h e vocal d e p a r t m e n t a n d
musically just floats a l o n g to nothing.
The a l b u m tries t o b e diverse, fea-
turing a violin intro to Secretly a n d vary-
ing t h e t e m p o , but it doesn't w o r k like
s o m e o f their previous releases did. They
can d o it, but it just doesn't h a p p e n with
Post Orgasmic Chill.
A nice feature o f this a l b u m is the
extensive interactive element is contains.
O f course, y o u n e e d a PC or M a c with
CD-Rom but given that you're in for a
treat, it might b e worth investing. There's
b a n d interview f o o t a g e , t h e interesting
v i d e o to Charlie Big Potato, a gallery of
pictures, lyrics a n d links to f i n d i n g m o r e
stuff o n t h e W e b . El
