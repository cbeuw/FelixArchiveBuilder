Viva Football (PSX)
Virgin Interactive
Football, football, football. For s o m e crazy
reason it s e e m s that all I have b e e n
reviewing for t h e last f e w w e e k s a r e
football m a n a g e m e n t or football playing
games, or even r u n n i n g football related
competitions. After all this football y o u
w o u l d think that t h e next football g a m e
to c o m e a l o n g w o u l d m e e t a very j a d e d
reviewer a n d b e placed in t h e bin at t h e
first fault.
This b e i n g true I tried really hard t o
hate Viva
Football
f r o m t h e
kick o f f - a n d
totally failed.
This is a
football
g a m e that
finally has a
serious g o
at t h e EA
fifia (well it
s e e m s like a
mafia organ-
isation) a n d c o m e s off the
w i n n e r o n t h e Playstation.
I'll repeat that, this g a m e is
better than A c t u a Soccer,
a m o r e s e n s i b l e o p t i o n
than Sensible Soccer, kicks
the youngster M r O w e n
into t h e stands a n d it
meets a n d beats FIFA '99
in extra time.
L o o k at t h e s c r e e n
shots, well these are t h e
quality graphics that y o u
get, a n d they dont just look g o o d w h e n
still. T h e a n i m a t i o n o f t h e players is both
s m o o t h a n d fast. This has b e e n possible
mainly b e c a u s e o f t h e c a m e r a a n g l e
u s e d . S o m e will find it a little far away
f r o m t h e action but most will find it just
t h e right distance to be able t o plan
t h o s e pin point passes a n d crosses. If
there is a complaint it can only b e o f t h e
s p e e d o f t h e g a m e . For t h e b e g i n n e r it
w h i z z e s a b o u t just a little bit t o o quickly,
t h o u g h stick
w i t h it a n d
i s o o n t h e
force (of t h e
pass) will be
w i t h y o u -
sorry I'll d o
no m o r e Star
Wars refer-
e n c e s 'till
July.
W h a t I
can't s h o w
y o u o n t h e
s c r e e n is t h e a l m o s t
perfect s o u n d . T h e
pitch s h o o k with
s o u n d c o m i n g f r o m
the stands a n d t h e
o c c a s i o n a l referee
c o m m e n t . Even t h e
lack o f a c o m m e n t a r y
o n this 9 8 % c o m p l e t e
version did not detract
f r o m t h e other s o u n d -
also w h i l e t h e c o m -
mentry is nice it d o e s
start t o grind w h e n
Barry c o m m e n t s for t h e twentieth time
that h e could not hit that with a banjo.
The current trend in these g a m e s is
to include even m o r e stadia (300 in this
one), e v e n m o r e t e a m s (1035 - they
might have your local p u b t e a m , c o m -
plete with t h e short fat o n e w h o plays in
goal a n d hits a n y o n e w h o c o m e s near)
. There is also t h e q u o t a o f historical
g a m e s with t e a m s as far back as 1958 to
be picked, so its t i m e to dust d o w n t h e
1990
England
a n d Ger-
m a n y
t e a m s
a n d this
t i m e
m a k e
sure it
doesnt
get any-
w h e r e
near
penalties, if y o u really w a n t to avenge
injustice y o u could try the 1986 world cup
finals a n d m a k e sure M a r a d o n n a fails to
stay o n t h e pitch for long.
This g a m e is g o o d , t h e control and
g a m e p l a y give y o u total control, a n d
even if it is not as easy to pick u p as other
systems it rewards y o u with m u c h more
fluid football - either that or t h e long
ball g a m e b e c o m e s t h e tactic of choice.
The graphics a n d s o u n d are excellent,
the crowd will start
jeering if y o u start
playing t o o many
wild balls.
Virgin Inerac-
tive are o n t o a
w i n n e r . EA are
g o i n g to have to
o o k d e e p a n d
hard a n d finally
h a v e a g a m e of
c a t c h u p o n their
hands.
Easter News : Bunnies not included
Eidos : Cheap Cheap Games
Eidos are a d d i n g five n e w titles t o their

A c t u a Golf 2, reviewed last year a n d

the ball in t h e hole.
A c t u a Soccer 2, with live c o m m e n t r y

O w e n as t h e m o t i o n capture m o n k e y .
Look out for reviews next m o n t h .
N2000 - not till 2001
N i n t e n d o l o o k like h o l d i n g back t h e
launch o f the N2000, the N i n t e n d o 128
bit processor based g a m e s c o n s o l e till
2001.
Aparently the system has b e e n given
an a m b e r light a n d t h e system has not
b e e n finalised. Several factors such as
h o w well N64 titles such as Perfect Dark
a n d D o n k e y K o n g 64 d o , as well as h o w
sucessful t h e Playstation 2 is will effect
not only t h e systems capability but also
its launch date.
The unfinalised details specify a poly-
g o n e n g i n e capable o f h a n d l i n g 20 mil-
lion raw polygons per s e c o n d , but t h e
biggest s h o c k is the lack o f a cartridge
system. N i n t e n d o have realised that it
was this that killed mass software devel-
o p m e n t w h i c h m e a n t that f e w p e o p l e
b o u g h t it. Hurrah for the learning expe-
rience.
Blender Book
A n d finally s o m e t h i n g a little bit more
serious. For all t h o s e w h o mess about
with 3-D r e n d e r i n g - n o w surely thats a
f e w of us out there, there is a n e w begin-
ners b o o k by T o n Roosendaal. Blender
v1.5 m a n u a l .
For all those not in the k n o w Blender
is a really useful 3-D tool. I've used it o n
the M a c a n d also o n a linux box. Its a lit-
tle bit c o m p l e x as y o u w o u l d expect
f r o m a useful tool but as s o o n as you get
the h a n g o f it y o u can p r o d u c e s o m e
quite s t u n n i n g 3-D effects.
As well as b e i n g a beginners b o o k
it also m a n a g e s to d o u b l e as a reference.
Quite handy as after y o u have mastered
the basics y o u g o a w a y for a couple of
months a n d c o m e back finding you have
forgotten most o f w h a t y o u spent long
hours learning.
