X8R-S (Manic Moped)
Honda
Next time y o u m a n a g e to e s c a p e f r o m
the c a m p u s a n d get to w a n d e r a r o u n d
the real L o n d o n streets k e e p a n e y e o u t
for t h e traffic. Normally this m e a n s b i g
red buses, multicoloured taxi's a n d t h e
occasional beaten u p stealth Cavalier.
However in t h e last f e w years a rapidly
i n c r e a s i n g n u m b e r o f s c o o t e r s a n d
m o p e d riders have b e e n f i n d i n g that
t w o w h e e l s are rather g o o d at d e a l i n g
with jams, that they can park for free a n d
that a smart scoot looks pretty cool in the
s u m m e r .
M o p e d s a n d Scoots are t h e ultimate
g a d g e t r o u n d t o w n . They're o b v i o u s ,
they have s o m e usefulness, b u t a b o v e
they look g o o d . The X8R-S ( H o n d a has
decided not to give this bike a n a m e just
a sequence of letters that give a n impres-
sion of an experimental w e a p o n f o u n d
in a Japanese anime) is H o n d a ' s t o p o f
the range 50cc m o p e d . D e s i g n e d a n d
styled in Italy it has t h e t o u c h o f t h e
Latins about it. The front a n d rear have
a particularly sculptured a p p e a r a n c e a n d
while not having t h e trick front w h e e l
forks that the Peugeot scoots have nor
the r o u n d e d design sophistication o f t h e
n e w Italian bikes, t h e sharp lines w h i c h
mark t h e front a n d b a c k m a k e this
m o p e d look m u c h m o r e shark-like.
A n y w a y H o n d a , with a f e w excep-
tions, is not k n o w n for their radical styling
- if y o u think Volvo y o u will get t h e pic-
ture. H o n d a are k n o w n for p r o d u c i n g
very reliable a n d m e c h a n i c a l l y e x c e l -
lent bikes a n d
this o n e is n o
different. For
£1800 y o u get
a 50cc
e n g i n e , a
fully a u t o m a t i c
belt drive,
front
a n d
J g i ^
erate to 25 m p h as quick as most tin
boxes in t h e t o w n .
The fully automatic belt drive m e a n s
that t h e bike is incredibly simple to ride.
Just twist t h e right grip a n d t h e bike
moves forward (ok the automatic gear-
ing m e a n s that y o u are not g o i n g to
be launching t h e front w h e e l into
the air but o n a 50cc m o p e d in
the city t h o s e sort o f
antics t e n d to
rear disc brakes
a n d best o f all, a n
electric starter.
What d o e s all this m e a n . Well t h e
50cc motor m e a n s that y o u have a t o p
s p e e d o f 30 m p h , but the ability to accel-
attract
attention o f t h e
met police, a n d don't look as g o o d as
y o u think). The belt drive also m e a n s
that y o u dont have any messy, oily chain
to adjust a n d check every w e e k .
In fact m a i n t a i n i n g this bike from
w e e k to w e e k involves c h e c k i n g the lyre
pressures, m a k i n g sure t h e t w o stroke oil
tank has a s o m e oil left, a n d checking the
brake fluid levels. Tasks that take about
all o f 30 seconds. A n y t h i n g m o r e serious
a n d t h e garage will d o that.
The disc brakes, y o u have a 50cc
m o p e d a n d fit it with t h e s t o p p i n g capa-
bility not f o u n d o n s o m e 125cc motor-
bikes, y o u definately stop quickly - usually
a bit t o o quick for your o w n g o o d .
Finally t h e electric starter. This is the
g a d g e t o n a gadget. A kickstart o n a
bike like this usually involves about 5
seconds o f effort, o f which three of t h e m
is f i n d i n g t h e little stubby kick rod. (the
h a n d crank o n m y morris m i n o r is
another planet o f pain). The electric
start is definately for your lazy side.
The p r o b l e m with m o p e d s is in g e n -
eral the limiter. While the 50cc motor and
the gears c o u l d possibly d o 40 m p h
without m e s s i n g t h e acceleration up too
m u c h t h e law prevents y o u f r o m d o i n g
so. But as l o n g as y o u never attempt to
take o n t h e 40 or 50 m p h limit roads y o u
will never get b o r e d . Get a h e a d get a
m o p e d .

1 (APS Camera)
Canon
Another gadget, another five hours spent
not r e a d i n g t h e instructions. T h o u g h
w h e n t h e instruction b o o k is getting o n
for half t h e v o l u m e o f t h e actual g a d g e t
things are getting a bit serious. Luckily,
to use this little delight y o u don't n e e d
to read t h e w h o l e v o l u m e o f instruc-
tions in order to take reasonable photo's
- to get s o m e o f t h e special functions it
is worth it but y o u can usually discover
those by accident anyway.
APS cameras might b e heavily criti-
cised by t h e serious p h o t o g r a p h e r . The
negatives are smaller than t h e 3 5 m m
format, a n d they cost a f o r t u n e to
develop. At t h e u n i o n s h o p 3 5 m m film
is cheaper by over t w o p o u n d s a n d that
isn't including the extra charges that a d d
up if y o u u s e t h e extra p h o t o formats.
APS definately have a lot o f critics, but it
has quite a lot o f friends t o o .
S o m e o f t h e friends are b i g fans o f
the simplicity o f t h e cameras. N o n e o f
this m e s s i n g about everytime y o u load a
n e w film - just put t h e film in a n d close
the door (the c a m e r a d o e s t h e rest).
APS c a m e r a s also c a n switch
b e t w e e n three types o f picture format -
normal, e n h a n c e d a n d panoramic. O k it
is a little bit o f a cheat as t h e developer
just selects a portion o f t h e film a n d
b l o w s it u p to fit t h e paper, but t h e
panaramic shot can make even the most
b o r i n g landscape look fairly impressive -
well o k then slightly less boring.
But t h e best t h i n g about APS c a m -
eras is that because of the size o f the film
the c o m p a c t c a m e r a b e c o m e s t h e spy
c a m e r a that w e all w a n t e d to o w n as a
kid. The C a n o n Ixus L-1 is just such that
c a m e r a . Its smaller than t h e smallest o f
the O l y m p u s 3 5 m m M u j l range a n d can
e v e n surprise t h e most c a m e r a aware -
useful for catching p e o p l e d o i n g things
they are not s u p p o s e d to d o . After dis-
abling t h e flash y o u can shoot a n d run
like the best. The L-1 is the middle brother
of t h e family. It doesn't have t h e cheap
plastic feel o f t h e base Ixus, but it d o e s -
n't have t h e z o o m function o f the big
brother (which, n o w that I've got used to
the L-1, feels so heavy a n d bulky).
The L-1 d o e s share s o m e of
the optics o f t h e b i g g e r z o o m
brother. O p t i c s that i n c l u d e a
rather nice fast 2.8 lens - nice,
w h i c h at t h e t o u c h o f a button
retracts into the c a m e r a giving it a
c le a n p u r e profile - sleek a n d
smooth. Another button press a n d
it pops back out ready to take pic-
tures in less than a s e c o n d .
The flash is also part of the
body, rather than t h e p o p u p
effort in t h e big brother - w h i c h
can occasionally j a m , requiring a
n u d g e with a n o n c o n d u c t i n g rod
- using a metal pin is a simple w a y
to generate a spark generator a n d
a easy w a y to destroy an e x p e n -
sive camera.
Smaller than a small thing a n d
looking m u c h sexier than a very
sexy thing t h e Ixus L-1 has m a n -
a g e d to get r e c o m m e n d e d by
most c a m e r a m a g a z i n e s as t h e
best o f t h e o n e h u n d r e d p o u n d
cameras. It is a gadget a n d half.
The little numbered bubbles dont come with
the basic camera.
