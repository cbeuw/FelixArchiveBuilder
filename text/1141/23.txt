Faithless
'Bring My Family Back'
(Cheeky)
Faithless c o n t i n u e their a m a z i n g
progress both nationally a n d interna-
tionally with their 3rd single release f r o m
the UK G o l d a l b u m 'Sunday 8 p m ' . This
single, 'Bring M y Family Back' is
a d o w n b e a t track w i t h dark,
m o o d driven lyrics a n d d e e p
bass lines. Very d e e p a n d very
meaningful, s h o w i n g that Faith-
less don't always p r o d u c e
t h u m p i n g d a n c e tracks. T h e
other mixes available are c o m -
pletely different to t h e original.
The Paul V a n Dyk Remix is a
powerful progressive m i x - v e r y
fast, hard bass lines o f h i g h
quality. T h e Jan Driver M i x is
boring whilst t h e Rollo a n d Sis-
ter Bliss Mix is a d e e p dance ver-
sion. All in all a s u p e r b single.

Vicious Games'
(Platlpus)
This single is a f u s i o n o f
two closely related music eras.
The m o d e r n "dance music e n
vogue" c o m i n g f r o m Ftardfloor,
the older, 80's version, f r o m Yello. T h e
resulting collaboration is a fantastic elec-
tropop single with a very catchy t u n e o n
top o f a great beat. The original version
was released in 1985 a n d w a s a b i g suc-
cess. Originally a n electropop track, with
the help o f Ftardfloor a n d their brand o f
t e c h n o t h e single has a c h a n c e t o
b e c o m e a truly great single.

Another Level
'Be Alone No More'
An excellent track d o i n g the business
in the R&B clubs at the m o m e n t . Another
Level are re-releasing this, their debut sin-
gle with a d d e d lyrics f r o m Jay-Z. The sin-
gle also features another talked about cut
'Girl What Y o u W a n n a D o ' w h i c h fea-
tures Shola A m a - a n d again, big in t h e
R&B clubs. Great single a n d worth check-
ing out, especially if y o u like your R&B.

Beverley Knight
'Made It Back'
(Parlophone)
U p b e a t track that sits nicely in
b e t w e e n h o u s e a n d garage. T h e tune
isn't t h e most memorable I've ever heard,
but at t h e s a m e time it certainly isn't
offensive in a n y way. The production is
earned cash is three quality tracks, all
o o z i n g with funk a n d a little bit of soul.
This LP gives y o u groovy beats in multi-
tudes, simultaneously k e e p i n g y o u inter-
e s t e d , whilst still b e i n g chilled-out
e n o u g h to relax to. If y o u want a n idea
of w h e r e s o m e of this music m a y surface
then visit the Eclectronica r o o m at Turn-
mills. It is there w h e r e y o u will, o f course,
find tunes as diverse a n d as intriguing as
this set.

Danny Rose
'Bread Into Stones EP'
(Hard Hands)
D a n n y Rose? N o w I used to k n o w a
really s a d O x f o r d DJ called t h e s a m e .
Surely it can't b e h i m ! A n d I'd b e very sur-
prised if it w a s , for t w o very g o o d rea-
sons, firstly this is not in the slightest bit
cheesy, a n d secondly it is g o o d (some-
t h i n g that m y o l d friend D a n n y sadly
wasn't). W h a t y o u get for your hard

'One Hand Clapping'
(Fluff Records)
What can I say about this? Well, a lot
actually. This t u n c c a m e to m c just at the
right time. It's exactly the sort of stuff that
John "00" Fleming (a current favourite)
w o u l d play in o n e o f his build-up packed
sets. ' O n e H a n d C l a p p i n g ' has every-
thing that y o u want in a n uplifting house
track - a healthy beat, build-ups, break-
d o w n s , a great synth melody, a bit o f
cheesy sampled vocals, a n d t w o stunning
mixes o n t h e o n e vinyl. M y first choice
w o u l d b e t h e 'jon t h e Dentist Mix', but
the 'Sunrise Mix1
o n the A-sidc also cuts
the m u s t a r d . H a p p y , up-beat h o u s e
music with a great e d g e to it. M o s t def-
initely a top d o g . G o out a n d buy this a n d
y o u won't b e d i s a p p o i n t e d .

Morgan Reno
'When America's Wildest Animals Res-
cue Cops 7 EP'
(Offshoot Records)
A n o t h e r stupidly titled LP from M o r -
gan Reno, this o n e delivering y o u three
tracks that c a n only b e d e s c r i b e d as
'fillers.' They are t h e d a n c e sin-
gle versions o f t h e album-filler
tracks that resign s o m e LPs to
mediocrity. What these tracks
are, a n d s h o u l d pretty m u c h
only b e used for is as a set of
loops a n d beats that DJs can
play a r o u n d with whilst c o n -
structing a set. W h e n used for
this p u r p o s e I have n o prob-
lems with their existence, but I
wouldn't g o o u t a n d b u y the
record b e c a u s e o f t h e tunes
or m e l o d i e s o n it. O n e o f the
tracks is even called 'Chuggin',
so that s h o u l d give y o u a clue
a b o u t h o w this piece o f h o u s e
s o u n d s like. O n l y b u y if y o u
are a very g o o d aspiring DJ.

Incognito
I I 'Nights Over Egypt (Remixes)'
(Talkln' Loud)
carpark
Standard h o u s e a n d g a r a g e
remixes o f the Incognito release that I
reviewed a f e w w e e k s back. This set o f
tracks isn't really a marked i m p r o v e m e n t
or set back f r o m t h e original release. In
fact, t h e tracks are a bit o n t h e average
side, apart f r o m t h e MJ Cole Dub, w h i c h
w o u l d fit s e a m l e s s l y into a n y f u n k y
garage set.
