24 March 1999 Tha Bomb! 31
At Song last the Blackstreet album has Finally arrived Album of the year? + We look at the lat-
est batch of singles doing it on the street!
Whats up IC! Last w e e k of term a n d o n c e
its over w e got time to m e s s a b o u t with
revision for those all important exams,
but ya g o n n a listen to while you're study-
ing? I'm g o n n a tell y o u !
After interviewing Beverley knight I feel
that I have to big up her latest offering
the reworking of ' M a d e It Back', but
there is no n e e d to big it u p for the sake
of it this is really g o o d , a l t h o u g h I pre-
fer the original this will probably do m o r e
d a m a g e o n the charts. There's a slight
change to the feel, m a k i n g it m o r e of a
old school soul feel to it.
The three lovely ladies TLC are u p next
with their massive hit 'No Scrubs' this has
been about for a while a n d is w i c k e d . Its
been released o n a t w o C D set, the first
of which has t w o mixes o f ' N o Scrubs',
both of w h i c h are g o o d a n d the a l b u m
track 'Silly Hos' w h i c h is brilliant as well.
The s e c o n d C D has 'No...' as well as t w o
classics from their previous a l b u m 'Creep'
and n u m b e r o n e 'Waterfalls'.
Talking a b o u t lovely ladies w e o n the
original silly ho the R&B diva M a r i a h as
she releases o n e o f the previously unre-
leased tracks f r o m her 'No. Is' a l b u m ,
namely 'I Still Believe'. This is not that
great as a tune, its solid, but not out-
s t a n d i n g a n d quite s i m p l y d o e s n ' t
deserve a m e n t i o n in this page, but w e
n e e d s o m e excuse to put the pic-
ture in so here it is.
Finally
Blackstreet are legitimately
hailed as o n e of the R&B
s u p e r g r o u p s a n d their
n e w release has b e e n
eagerly anticipated
since w e all earned
they w e r e in the
studio working on
it. 'Finally d o c s

out by the swing-
beat innovator

Riley...that pat-

at every level. With
their first two a l b u m s
they set out their intent
to hit us with the phattest
tunes, bad ass beats a n d killer

w a s even better than w e could have
expected c o n s i d e r i n g the pressures that
w e r e o n t h e m to live up to their previous
classic sets. After the s t u p e n d o u s
'Another Level' they had

ent again, like w e w e r e with N o Diggity.
fets not g o by t h o s e record industry
sales. Lets m a k e s o m e n e w o n e s up."
O n the first listen to 'Finally' its clear that
the s a m e s w i n g beat flava is there but
the differences arc there to be heard.
Blackstreet have taken it to the next
level. The first single off the a l b u m is
already d o i n g the rounds a n d is b l o w i n g
up big time, a collaboration with lus-
c i o u s Janet J a c k s o n called
'Girlfriend/Boyfriend'. This d e s t i n e d to
be a club classic. O n 'Can You Feel M e '
Teddy has sampled the Jackson Five t u n c
of the s a m e n a m e with s o m e phat
pyrotechnic beats, they rip it with a real
party tune. The only drawback is that it
is so reminiscent of awful Tampara 'Chim-
ney' s o n g w h i c h also samples that Jack-
son Five tune. Also included (probably
just to sell the album) is the Rugrats tune
'Take M e There', not the original version
t h o u g h , the remix w h i c h uses another
Jackson Five sample. This n e w version is
a extremely funky, but doesn't have the
s a m e
quirki-
ness of
the original.
T h e v o c o d e r is
back in full effect, its
b e c o m e Teddy's trade-
mark, a n d is used to wonderful
p u r p o s e in Yo Love' w h i c h is an up
t e m p o that rocks in a similar w a y to
'Don't Leave M e ' , but is a bit m o r e
upbeat.
Flipping o n to the d o w n l o w side I have
to m e n t i o n my favourite track the b e a u -
tifully sultry duet b e t w e e n the Blackstreet
boys a n d the a m a z i n g Mary J Bligc. The
tune is easily the standout as far as I a m
c o n c e r n e d , the actual w o r d s arc shit,
but the m e l o d y is p h e n o m e n a l , its great
a n d y o u got check it out. You also gotta
check out the funky s l o w e d d o w n 'Think
A b o u t You' w h i c h is Blackstreet at their
best, a w e s o m e h a r m o n i e s backed with
the usually p h a i bass lines. Lets not for-
get the s w e e p i n g ballad 'In A Rush' a col-
laboration with the daddy of soul the
n u m b e r o n e g e e z e r Stevie Wonder.
I c o u l d g o o n a n d o n about the quality
o n this a l b u m , I haven't even m e n t i o n e d
the bassey beat laden 'Don't Stop1
or
the beautiful 'Black a n d White', but you
get the idea. This a l b u m is up to the usual
Blackstreet standard a n d certainty will
o n e of the a l b u m s of the year but T H t
a l b u m of the year...I w a n n a wait for the
D'Angleo set first. M i l e n .
