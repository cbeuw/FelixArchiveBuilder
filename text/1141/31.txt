THE RIOT
Royal National Theatre, Cottesloe
C
ornwall. What does this word con-
jure up in your mind? Is it rugged
scenery, thundering waves and
the distant screeching of angry seagulls
and drowning surfers? Or maybe embit-
tered trawlermen moaning about EU
fishing quotas and dragnet infringe-
ments in the Spanish Box? Or is it all
those fibDem MPs that the Cornish
seem to love voting for?
Whatever your romantic (or patron-
ising!) preconceptions of Cornwall, this
new play written by Nick Darke and per-
formed by the well-respected Kneehigh
Theatre Company will surely reinforce
many of them. Honest to God, Cornwall
really is full of ye olde sea dogs, quaint
Dickensian capitalists and cheery ser-
vants who know their place. Or rather it
was one hundred years ago, when this
play is set. In truth, the play draws inspi-
ration from a real historical event which
happened in 1896 in the town of New-
lyn. A long time ago it may have been,
but the story also has some obvious par-
allels with the situation in Cornwall today.
This may be difficult, but shut your
eyes for a minute and picture yourself as
a Cornish fisherman. Outsiders are fish-
ing in waters you consider to be your
own. And they do it on Sundays, damn
it, when you are all busy being religious!
Lets give them a good kicking and drive
them out of town. You get the idea?
Things arc all going to plan, of
course, until the paternalistic mayor and
local Mr Big (Mr Bolitho) steps in and
tries to twist the situation to his own
financial advantage. But whaddaya
know, one riot, a stabbing, a hanging
and one attempted public execution
down the line, things turns out OK for
everyone, after all!
As you can see, the play piles on the
farce. But at times I couldn't help but
wonder whether they actually intended
the performance to be some form of
black-humoured social commentary. If
social commentary was their aim, how-
ever, they failed. If on the other hand
they were going for light satire and
almost Shakespearean farce, Ihcy tri-
umphed. The fact that they received a
massive laugh for (the usually depress-
ing) events of a suicide and a brutal
stabbing is testament to this comic tri-
umph.
Two performances stood out from
the rest: Geoffrey Hutchings (Bolitho,
pictured righl in main photo) and Emma
Rice (Harriet Screetch). Hutchings, is an
ultra-experienced RADA graduate who
starred as Michael Gambon's dim-witted
sidekick in the MalQrci TV detective
series. The grumpy persona of Mr
Bolitho had all the best jokes and Hutch-
ings knew exactly how to ham them up.
Emma Rice was an equally effective
comedian, playing opposite Bolitho as
the new servant who has the courage to
stand up to her employer.
The overall performance was very
slightly marred by the occasional silent
hiatus, which no doubt was intended to
add drama but unfortunately looked as
if the actor had forgotten her/his lines.
This is a minor gripe, however, and
the play was superbly entertaining. But
the playwright's laboured parallels with
the current pre-millennial social situa-
tion seemed a little banal. If you want to
have a good laugh then go and see this
play; but I certainly didn't buy the social
commentary flannel and neither should
you.

ICSO ANNIVERSARY CONCERT
Great Hall
A
n emotional performance brim-
ming with flair and technical abil-
ity provided a fitting
commemoration of fifty years of
music by the Imperial Collegi
Symphony Orchestra in the
Great Hall on friday 12
March. The concert also
marked the centenary
of the City and
Guilds Union
who kindly (^r^
sponsored the
event.
On a day
tinged with sad
ness for many music
lovers - the death of the great violinist
Yehudi Menuhin was announced only
hours before conductor Richard Dickins
lifted his baton - the ICSO were enthusi-
astically received by a capacity audience
upon finishing a programme of Copland,
Prokofiev and Mahler.
The concert began
appropriately,
considering the
day's sad news,
with a thoughtful and
melancholy piece -
Aaron Copland's Quiet
City. The orchestral
accompaniment was
thoughtfully phrased, pro-
t j y v i d i n g support to the
highly impressive soloists,
Daniel Elson and Stephen Hicks on
cor anglais and trumpet respectively, in
an accomplished and moving recital.
Menuhin himself would have been
proud to witness the ability of violinist
Kahae Han in a stunning performance of
Prokofiev's Violin Concerto in D major.
Kahae, a fourth year student of physics
and music, was almost effortless in her
mastery of an extremely testing ,
piece of music, and was
greeted with a rous-
ing recep-
tion. The j
lyrical first
movement
was particu-
larly impres-
sive, as the
violin almost
floated above the
sensitive accom-
paniment from the
orchestra. Indeed, Kahae made the violin
sing when required, without losing the
ability to attack the music, as in the
Scherzo.
The final movement was characterised
by the haunting first subject, which led to the
magical conclusion, as the flute and violin
played out the final D major tune. Round-
ing off the night's entertain-
% \ ment, a powerful rendition
of Mahler's Symphony
^NT^X ^ ° ' i n

V\\^>^-''' ensured that the evening
ended at maximum volume, leaving
the audience to take to their feet in praise
and admiration. Here's to the next fifty years
of symphony music at Imperial College!
