ollowing the suc-
cess of ICMUN’s
five-man dele-
gation in Oxford
earlier in the year, we have
sent a delegation almost
twice that size to the
Cambridge International
Model United Nations
conference, to once again
act as representatives of
different countries saving
the world. To say that
the weekend was full of
surprises would be an
understatement, and to
say that the resolutions
passed would at all reduce
the chances of us dying in
World War Three would
be a blatant lie.
Our delegate in the
Disarmament and Interna-
tional Security Committee
was deeply shocked to
witness Russia working
alongside the USA to lead
a unanimous condem-
nation of cyber-attacks.
However, the future of
humanity once again
began to look grim when
the session ended with the
passing of a resolution

mament with lethal killer

best efforts.

as the delegate of France

and the room was split in

the #MeToo movement.

Imperial’s Space Society launches High-Altitude

Payload sadly lost over Norfolk due to GPS failure
O
n 3rd
November,
members of
the Imperial
College Society
for the Exploration and
Development of Space
headed off to Elsworth,
Cambridgeshire, to launch
our payload on board a
large weather balloon.
However, as soon as
we let off the balloon,
we realised that the GPS
had lost lock and lost
track of the position of
the balloon. However, the
transmitter was sending
back pressure and temper-
ature data over radio. We
hoped that we could home
in on the signal by using
our directional antenna
to pick the location of
the payload. Using data
from the NOAA weather
service, we expected the
payload to descend on the
parachute and land near a

On board, we had 2
compact cameras as well
as a flight computer,
relaying telemetry on
its location, altitude,
temperature and pressure
to our tracking station on
the ground. All looked
fine before launch with a
healthy stream of telem-
etry received at our base
station on the ground.
With great anticipation
for a High altitude balloon

village called Reepham in
Norfolk.
Undaunted by the loss
of GPS data, we headed
off in our van towards
Norfolk. As long as the
payload was in the air, we
could pick up telemetry
due to the clear line of
sight. After around 1
hour of flight, we knew
the balloon had burst
and started descending
because the pressure
readings started to rise, in-
dicating that it was falling
towards the ground. The
payload’s descent was
slowed by a parachute
that deployed as soon as
the balloon burst. Based
on the pressure readings,
the highest altitude trans-
mitted was 28.5 km, three
times higher than any
commercial Jet would fly.
After the landing, we
could not get any signal
from the payload due to
land features blocking the
radio signals. Our hopes
were slightly lifted when
we managed to pick up
extremely faint signals
from the payload near
the village of Reepham.
However, by then it had
become dark and we had
to give up on our quest to
find the payload.
Our post mortem
analysis of the launch
concluded that either the
antenna for the GPS was
accidentally shielded by
a battery pack or spurious
interference from the
cameras may have caused
the GPS to loose lock.
We hope to do better
next time. We have
several exciting new
plans for future missions.
We are planning on
designing a tracker and
balloon for a mission to
CIRCUMNAVIGATE
the world. We are always
on the lookout for more
people to join our team.

Many thanks to the
Imperial College Robotics
Society for maintaining
the lab for the develop-
ment of our payload.
