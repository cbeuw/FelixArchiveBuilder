Fallout 76- I want to love you
A game full of ambition and potential but whose execution falls short

L
et me lay down
my biases up
front. I do love
fallout; I’ve
clocked an irresponsible
number of hours in 4 and
New Vegas over the last
few years. I gel with the
art direction, I like the
setting and I love a good
open world. I, however,
also ardently defended
Fallout 76 when it was
announced. I saw the
potential in a multiplayer
only fallout and was eager-
ly anticipating re-entering
the wasteland no matter
what form that took.
Finally, the game drops,
and I find myself dumb-
struck. I’m not angry. I’m
just disappointed.
Fallout 76 is a frus-
trating game to discuss
because I really want to
like it, and there are times
when I genuinely do.
But there are some fun-
damental flaws with the
game, and I worry they
may not be fixable in post.
Let’s start by looking at
the good though--I want
to give credit where its
due. The game is visually
stunning; this is the best a
creation engine has ever
looked, and it pairs beau-
tifully with the vibrant
landscape of atomic West
Virginia. The game has
a warmer colour palette
than previous games,
making the landscape
very inviting. It makes the
experience of just walking
around fun, but we’ll
come back to that. The
great visual design carries
over to the player custo-
misation. More players
means there needs to be
visual diversity in items
(especially armour) in
order for you to tell each
other apart and express
yourself. 76 manages to
integrate all these new
designs pretty seamlessly
(I especially like some of
the new power armours).
The standard combat
mechanics are the best
they’ve ever been in
a modern Fallout, and
this is good since the
highlight of the game is
encountering and fighting
the large array of new
and incredibly interesting
monster-minibosses. In
my time with the game,
these encounters were all
fun and unique enough
to each leave a lasting
impression. The design
team clearly had a lot of
fun with these things and
it shows.
But you knew this part
was coming from the title.
The first and most obvious
issue is the optimisation.
I don’t care how nice
your car is, if you put a
“The standard

broken engine in it it’s not
going to get us anywhere.
There was a no-clip doc-
umentary released about
76’s development which
stated that the way the
creation engine worked
was not only not suited
for multiplayer but was
basically the diametric
opposite of a multiplayer
engine. And it shows, this
game runs abysmally. But
of course it does, they
broke the engine so bad to
force in multiplayer, it’s
honestly incredible it runs
at all. This also means the
game is buggier than ever,
and the classic Bethesda
bugs lose their charm in a
multiplayer setting where
you can’t just idly reload a
save when shit fucks up. I
could list bugs all day, but
one noteworthy one was
an audio glitch that caused
loud gunshots to go off
behind me randomly. In
a game with PVP, that is
unacceptably bad.
But the problems
extend past mere bugs
and into design decisions.
VATs just don’t work
now. Given bullet time
simply can’t work in
multiplayer, VATs has
been re-imagined as an
auto-targeting system.
This would have been
the right decision had it
worked; however, without
the slow-motion the
calculations are erratic,
especially with the more
frantic monsters, leaving
you doomed to miss as
a 90% hit rate suddenly
drops to 0% as a ghoul
walks behind a coffee
table.
Unfortunately, the
greatest issues with the
game are those made by
choice. The world may
be pretty but there just
isn’t much to do. Quest
lines are effectively just
following post-it notes
Then, due to scheduling,
my party had to disband.
But I still wanted to play,
so I kept on going and
very quickly realised that
the game wasn’t fun, I was
just doing something new
with mates I had history
with.Any game can be fun
with friends so that’s not a
valid defence. I enjoyed
aliens colonial marines,
but that’s only because
my 3 mates and I bought
it for £3 each so we could
riff on it in multiplayer.
Sure, it might be fun with
a group of fallout enthusi-
ast friends, but the game
underneath is hollow and
broken. If the base under
the multiplayer isn’t a
well designed game, then
the experience is going to
have no longevity. I pray
support for this game is
good because I want it to
one day be great, but at
the time of writing it’s just
a disappointment. If you
were on the fence, hold
off for a couple of months
and see if Bethesda make
good on their claims of
heavy patching.

must rebuild”. They
stripped out the 2 core
driving forces of the
Fallout franchise, which
you can only do if you
replace them with equally
engaging and substantial
features. Player interac-
tion is just not enough in
its current form. I do think
the idea of a huge map
with limited players could
have been the right way to
do it, but the interactions
aren’t meaningful. PVP is
really easy to avoid and
even if you do die the lack
of permadeath removes
a lot of the bite and
tension a survival game
usually has. The survival
mechanics themselves are
serviceable, but they’re
not trying to innovate with
them so they’re not espe
cially interesting. Very
quickly most people will
develop a live-and-let-live
attitude, at which point
other players barely factor
in and you’re left with a
lukewarm survival game
and a pretty but empty
landscape to explore.

time with Fallout 76 for
the first 6 hours or so.
