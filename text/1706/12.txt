Riz Ahmed Is Synonymous With Brown Excellence
I
f you’re brown, woke
(shut the fuck up it’s
a meme to be woke)
or from London,
and especially if you’re
all three, chances are
you know Riz Ahmed
to be a Desi messiah.
Riz began his trajectory
towards this status after
appearing in 2010’s Four
Lions, a now cult classic
comedy following the hi-
lariously misguided path
of a group of radicalised
Muslim men. Though on
its surface the film was a
slapstick, brazen, satirical
statement, there was cer-
tainly a layer of essential
nuance and dissociative
confusion exemplified es-
pecially in Riz’s character.
Indeed, this is a contra-
diction that Riz’s career,
be that acting, writing
or rapping (the man’s
a polymath, a brown
Donald Glover of sorts)
has always been rooted
in exploring. In fact, it all
became comically meta
when he was beaten and
interrogated about sus-
pected terrorist motives
upon returning to Luton
airport from the Berlin
Film Festival in 2006
where his film, The Road
To Guantanamo, won
an award. That film was
about the real-life story of
four brown friends from
Birmingham who were
illegally imprisoned and
tortured in Guantanamo.
You really can’t make this
shit up.
Trouble at airports is
one of a lexicon of refer-
ences that the perennial
British Pakistani Muslim
identity crisis is attached
to. Riz’s art, especially his
music (which he creates
under the name Riz MC)
is unashamedly thorough
and open in discussing
this world. It’s more
than relatable, and that’s
probably due to the al-
ienation of seeing so few
similar brown role models
on a platform as large as
his. It’s for this reason,
seeing him perform
‘Shoes Off’ (“My shoes
off at the masjid, yo/ My
shoes off at the airport”)
whilst surrounded by
hundreds of brown faces
last weekend was a real
moment for me. That song
is from 2016’s Cashmere
by Swet Shop Boys, a
hip-hop duo that Riz is
half of. Influenced by the
hilariously nonchalant
yet impassioned Heems
(the other half of Swet
Shop Boys and one third
of the former Das Racist
goofball trio), Cashmere
was excitable, dreamy
and decidedly Desi
without compromising on
realness. Best believe my
favourite moment of the
concert was yelling out
the best line of the project
in unison with Riz: “Zayn
Malik’s got more than
eighty virgins on him/
There’s more than one di-
rection to get to paradise”.
If you really want to
get to know the fluidity
and imposed restlessness
of Riz’s identity and that
of his fans, you’d have to
listen to his solo album,
Englistan, released the
same year. The album
dissects, narrates and
muses on a range of
issues: the diverse melting
pot of Britishness, having
to hide yourself from your
traditional family, de-
pression and anxiety, the
government’s economic
shafting of the poor, psy-
chopathic honour killings
and good old racist
nationalism. Riz sees all,
feeding off the plethora of
cultures and perspectives
he’s been exposed to.
Truly, he is proof that for
all its complexities and
neuroticism, growing
brown in Britain can be a
sociological education.
The music you didn’t even know you needed
I
’m mad, I’m riled
up and it’s all you
guys’ fault. Why am
I angry? I’ll tell you.
The Friday before last I
was ecstatic because I was
goingtoFatFreddy’sDrop
at O2 Brixton. Talking to
people from IC on the day
and explaining what glory
I was soon to witness
I realised not a single
goddamn person knew
who Fat Freddy’s Drop
are… this is unaccept-
able! I’m sure there are
students at IC who listen
to the group but my plan
to write a review of their
performance probably
would’ve meant nothing
to the vast majority of
readers. I’m not saying
that Fat Freddy’s Drop are
the best band ever or that
they’re revolutionaries.
I’m simply stating that
their music is fan-fuck-
ing-tastic and clearly
more people should be
listening. I’m here to
convince you why.
Fat Freddy’s Drop
are a seven piece dub/
reggae/soul/jazz/techno
band from New Zealand.
The group started coming
together in the late 90s
but didn’t form a proper
band until the early 00s.
Their debut album Based
On A True Story, released
in 2005, was the highest
selling album ever in New
Zealand. It stayed on the
top 40 charts for over two
years. Since then, they’ve
released three more
studio albums, so don’t
worry, there’s plenty to go
around.
The band’s mix of influ-
ences and styles combine
into a truly unique sound
that you can’t help but get
swept away by. Each song
has contagious energy
and gorgeous melodies
that anyone can enjoy.
Dallas Tamaira (aka Joe
Dukie) is the vocalist
and has the sweetest
caramel-like voice that
has ever graced your ears,
I just love it every time
he starts singing. Chris
Faiumu ( aka DJ Fitchie)
is both the bands percus-
sionist and producer; he’s
exceptionally talented.
The mixing of the tracks
is always spot-on and
he makes the percussion
not just something in the
background but one of the
best parts of each song
due to his perfect pitching
and texture choices.
The rest of the band
make up the instrumen-
tal profile: saxophone,
trumpet, trombone, tuba,
keyboard and guitar.
Their first two albums
are polished versions of
live performances they
gave for FOUR YEARS
before they gathered in
the studio! The band is a
well oiled machine that
have been perfecting their
craft and group chemistry
over the decades.
I could go on for
another half page but it’s
probably better if you just
listen yourself so here
are my recommendations
to get started. If you’re
looking for an album,
listen to Based On A
True Story. Want up-beat
energetic songs? Listen to
‘Roady’, ‘Pull the Catch’,
and ‘Silver and Gold’.
Feeling blue? Listen to
‘Dark Days’, ‘Del Fuego’,
and ’10 Feet Tall’. Only
want smash hits? Listen
to ‘Ernie’, ‘Blackbird’,
and ‘Wandering Eye’.
If even one person
starts listening because
of me I’ll have done my
job properly. Then maybe
I can stop sulking and
simmer down.
