Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Bad Storytelling
Film Editor Aidan Chan sat through the latest film in the Harry Potter franchise.
I
walked into the
cinema with mild
apprehension. I
knew that the critical
reception was particularly
unfavorable, yet I had
hoped that this would be a
Pirates of the Caribbean:
Dead Man’s Chest scenar-
io, where the film would
still be immensely fun to
watch. After two hours
of sitting and hoping for
the best, I came out of
the cinema, defeated.
Fantastic Beasts: The
Crimes of Grindelwald
(Fantastic Beasts 2), is
a complete mess of a
film. The Harry Potter
franchise has finally lived
long enough to see itself
become the villain.
Fantastic Beasts 2 is
directed by David Yates,
and stars an ensemble
cast of Eddie Redmayne,
Katherine Waterston, Zoë
Kravitz, Johnny Depp
and many, many more.
However, the bomb that
destroys the film is J. K.
Rowling’s horrid screen-
play. It is actually quite
magical that a film can
be so boring with around
ten separate subplots
progressing simultane-
ously on screen (I am not
exaggerating; you can
count them if you want).
It is like watching Game
of Thrones, but instead
of ten hour seasons, you
get a two hour film; And
instead of interesting,
nuanced plotting, you get
stories that go absolutely
nowhere and are com-
pletely pointless.
The more separate
plots a film has, the less
time each plot gets. And
in a film like Fantastic
Beasts 2, each storyline
is assigned roughly 12
to 13 minutes of screen-
time. And so, instead
of self-contained and
fully-realised stories and
character arcs, we get ten
half-baked and lukewarm
plots ranging from soapy
melodrama, to misunder-
standings that are more
suitable in a 90s sitcom—
each of which fails to
allow any emotional
attachment. At the end,
I did not care about any
of the characters or their
struggles. Any tension
presented felt manufac-
tured, underdeveloped
“The Harry
Potter
franchise has

and inconsequential
because the film had to
rush off elsewhere to cater
to another subplot. I did
not care about Newt and
Tina’s forced romance, or
Credence’s quest to find
his origin. Even when
Hedwig’s Theme blasted
through the cinema
speakers and the iconic
Hogwarts castle appeared
in the distance, I did not
find an ounce of excite-
ment within me, because
I was so exhausted by the
film.
Plot twists are one of
the defining aspects of the
Harry Potter series, and
Rowling migrated this
tradition to the Fantastic
Beasts franchise. The
“Credence is the Obscuri-
al” twist is understandable
in the first film. But in
this one, the plot twists
are verging on absurdity.
I have heard many people
praise the final twist of the
film on social media, so
I was relatively excited
about whatever surprise
that might be. However,
that twist proves to be one
of the most laughable and
ridiculous moments of the
entire film. These reveals
worked in the Harry
Potter films because there
are carefully placed bread-
crumbs that hint towards
the twist. However, the
twist in Crimes of Grin-
delwald are unearned and
I have never rolled my
eyes harder.
With the departure of
any coherent story struc-
ture, the nostalgic magic
that is consistently present
in the Harry Potter series
also evaporated complete-
ly. The necessity of saying
spells out loud continues
to be entirely arbitrary.
The whimsy and inno-
vations of the previous
instalments are gone,
instead we get more secret
elevators, more moving
statues, more passage-
ways disguised as walls,
more random spells that
do things Muggles can do
equally well (like strap-
ping people into a chair) -

“The actors

basically nothing we have
not seen before (the only
novelty is a magical dust
hologram PowerPoint
thingy I guess). When a
magic-denying Marvel
flick felt more magical
than a franchise built
upon Harry Potter, you
know something has gone
wrong.
The actors might be
the only redeeming factor
of this film. They tried
their best to make use of
the very little screen-time
they were assigned. Ezra
Miller had moments of
brilliance, Johnny Depp
dominated each frame he
was in and Jude Law is
charismatic as a compas-
sionate Albus Dumble-
dore. The moments that
hint at the complicated re-
lationship between Dumb-
ledore and Grindelwald
are genuinely affecting,
but the flashes of sincerity
are quickly replaced by
more poorly presented
stories. Other aspects of
the film, including generic
CGI battles, uninspired
direction and abrupt tonal
shifts (far too often does
the film randomly cut
from a comedic moment
to Grindelwald ominously
declaring his evil plans)
do nothing to save this
film from being part of
the “unnecessary sequel”
gang.
The credits rolled and I

Kloves (who penned all
but one the screenplays
for the original Harry
Potter films), I find it
rather strange that no
one told Rowling that her
screenplay was poten-
tially problematic. Either
that, or she just did not
care. In a film without
beasts or crimes, Fantas-
tic Beasts: The Crimes of
Grindelwald is the quin-
tessential filler episode.
It is time for Rowling
to let go of her ego and
hire a real screenwriter to
polish and untangle her
unintelligible storylines,
so that this franchise can
reach the potential it is
capable of.
