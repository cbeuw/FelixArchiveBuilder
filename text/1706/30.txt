O
n Friday 26th
October, most
of the 2nd and
3rd Imperial
sailing teams met at
Victoria Coach Station to
make our way to compete
at the Wet Dream in
Reading. Stragglers were
forced to take the train,
which ultimately proved
to be much faster (but less
fun) than the coach. We
entertained ourselves on
the coach with food, food
and more food. Aidan,
however, was under the
impression that it would
be a sesh bus - sending us
a message requesting us to
be binned by the time we
got to the house.
After almost missing
our stop, we realised we
had not been dropped
in the town centre, but
somewhere by the side of
the M4, meaning we had
to then take two buses
followed by a 15 minute
walk to our host’s house.
No sooner had we put our
bags down and dibsed the
sofas, we all walked to
Co-op to buy some bevs
so we could catch up
with the pub crawl that
had been planned for the
night, which was already
on its penultimate pub!
Whilst in the pubs, older
members of the teams
caught up with friends
from other unis, and
freshers frequently got
caught out by the radical
“After the pubs
we all went to
the club to cut
some shapes”
“Overall,
Imperial White
came 7th and
Imperial Red
14th out of 18
teams, having
beaten a fair
few teams that
we wanted to.”
Callum at the club when
we were dragged unwill-
ingly from the dancefloor
left in order to actually
get some (4 hours) sleep.
On arriving at our host’s
house, we realised she
was still out and so we
learnt of a new entrance
to the house - namely,
the skylight to our room.
This apparently became
Olly’s preferred method
of entering the house as he
repeated it the following
night.
Despite lack of sleep
and with everyone safe
home (albeit some
much later than others),
Saturday was a good
start to the weekend with
Imperial White winning
five out of our six races.
Against Cardiff blue,
Imperial Red managed
a take out at Mark 3 to
get 2,3,4 only to hit each
other on the reach and lose
2,5,6. However, they then
went on to beat KNOBS
on the final beat after
their having a comfortable
lead with stable position
for the whole race. After
a long day of sailing, we
went home for a quick nap
and then started pre-ing
for the eagerly awaited
curry social. Our teams’
costume theme for the
night was The Nightmare
Before Christmas, and
almost none of us stuck
to it strictly apart from
some questionably drawn
face paint. Shoutout to
Toby actually putting
some effort in, coming
as “Sandy Claus” and
dressing in a morphsuit
in such cold conditions
(lows of 1°C!). Callum
also deserves a mention
for not being drunk, “just
really extroverted” when
he was asked to leave by
the manager, to which
he replied by shouting in
French.
Sunday, was a different
story for our success rate
- whilst nursing hang-
overs and battling with
lack of sleep, Imperial
White lost three of our
four races. Gabriel and
Calvin, competing as part
of the Old Waynfletes &
Friends team, managed
to beat Imperial White a
total of three times thanks
to various complications
with restarts, postpone-
ments and broken boats!
Due to increasing wind
strength, the course kept
on getting bigger and
bigger which didn’t help
with the punctuality of
changeovers and made
it even easier for us to
accidentally sail into
the race whilst waiting
for our start. The story
didn’t get any better for
Imperial Red either, with
an umpire getting in the
way of Eddie when his
rudder wasn’t working
properly in the middle of
one of their races. Overall,
Imperial White came 7th
and Imperial Red 14th
out of 18 teams, having
beaten a fair few teams
that we wanted to.
Even after the sailing
was done, our troubles did
not end there: on our way
home, due to delays in the
coach timetable, we were
faced with the possibility
of waiting for an hour and
a half in the cold for our
ride home! Luckily, the
coach arrived after a wait
of around 45 minutes,
which we survived with
the help of 6Terry’s Choc-
olate Orange and huddling
in a parking payment
booth. We arrived back in
London safe and sound,
and altogether content
with our performance
over the weekend.
Many thanks to the

After the pubs we all
went to the club to cut
some shapes - not before
Callum decided stealing
a mini traffic cone would
be a good idea. We also
managed to leave poor
University of Reading
Sailing Club for organis-
ing a great event, and also
a big thank you goes out
to Toby (Imperial White
Team Captain) for being a
shuttle service for us!
