HANGMAN
Library-goers found
themselves in a rather
sticky situation when
Security pulled the
plug on toilets on all
floors.

across all
levels were
found to be
out of order, creating
long queues for the few
available stalls and leav-
ing tens of hard-working
students in visible dis-
comfort.
Eyewitnesses de-
scribed the scenes are
“unbelieveable”. Melissa
Gardeleau, a second year
Medical Biosciences
student, said, “the queues
were longer than for
Metric on a Friday night!
Actually, that might not be
a great point of reference
for anyone, but still it was
mad long.”
Available toilets were
found to have incredibly
low water supply, and
library staff were called in
to operate an emergency
one-in-one-out policy,
with Red Bull being
offered to wash their
hands with.
The situation was
further complicated by
many of the individuals
involved experiencing
symptoms of violent di-
arrheoa whilst waiting for
toilets to be available.
“Shit literally hit the
fan,” said Jimmy Bean,
a final year Mechanical
Engineering undergrad-
uate. “Like seriously. It
was raining sweetcorn
everywhere. ”
Library staff were less
than pleased with the
events of the day. “We just
got this place looking half
decent!” said Sybil Fre-
cature, senior librarian.
“If all these sad children
just went home at night
instead of trying to get all
their shit done here, we
wouldn’t be in this damn
situation!”
The cases were linked
to alleged changes in the
library café’s offerings.
Several of the affected
individuals were found
to have consumed fried
foods from the counter.
Further investigation
found was that the oil used
originated from a Shell
oilfield in Guatemala and
was given to the College
as assurance to gain back-
door access into careers
Sources from within the
cube say that President of
Imperial College, Jalice
Fast, wanted to take a
bubble bath in the Ethos
swimming pool. “She had
a long day,” said Erica
Muzungu, Prof Fast’s
PA, “she had to walk up a
single flight of stairs today
to get to her meeting. She
deserved a break!”
They’re practically bursting under all the pressure...// Imperial College London
Alessandro Buy,
Deputy President (Renu-
meration), expressed his
frustration at the incident.
“For fuck’s sake, this
place is already a shithole,
and now we’ve got actual
turds in the library that
aren’t medics? What the
hell is that extra £250 on
our home fees going to??”
The office of Prof
Fast did not respond
to NegaFelix’s call for
comment, rather directing
us to an 0780 number
costing £4.50 a minute.
The pre-recorded voice
message was quoted as
saying, “we’re sorry we
can’t take your call right
now, but please leave a
message and we’ll get
back to you when we
actually give a shit.”
“It was
unbelievable;
the queues
were longer
than Metric on
a Friday night!”
events with students.
It was later uncovered
that the call to shut of the
water supply, in fact, came
from the Faculty Building.
“If all these
sad children
[didn’t try]
to get shit
done here, we
wouldn’t be in
this situation!”
