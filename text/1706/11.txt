Rough times ahead for E3? Sony announces that they
won’t be attending the 2019 convention
In what seems to be a bizzare decision by Sony executivies the company is backing out of the major gaming
convention E3 and their own convention ‘Playstation Experience’

T
he Electronic
Entertainment
Expo (E3) is a
massive gaming
convention aimed at
showcasing upcoming
content from major devel-
opers and publishers. With
its initial start-up being
in 1995, it has continued
since with thriving attend-
ance and popularity. Just
the mention of E3 within
the gaming community
is enough to get gamers
eagerly anticipating the
potential announcements.
So why on Earth is Sony
not attending E3 2019?
Could it be that Sony isn’t
able to afford E3, or is this
just beginning of the nails
that will soon be ham-
mered into E3’s coffin?
Interested? Well, let’s get
right into it!
Why is Sony not
attending? :
Let me start right off the
bat by saying that Sony is
by no means experiencing
financial issues; in fact, the
amount of PS4’s they’ve
sold is a whopping 2.5
times that of Microsoft’s
Xbox One. With a clear
landslide victory in this
generation’s console
wars, there’s no chance
that Sony is having money
issues. So what could it be
then? And why are fans
concerned? Well, Sony
seems to be going cold
turkey on announcements
and releases, not only
are they not attending E3
they’ve even cancelled
their own convention,
Playstation Experience
(originally planned for
this December), despite
its four-year uninterrupted
run. What could Sony
possibly be thinking?
I’m glad to inform you
that Sony hasn’t gone
completely off the rails;
however, they seem
to be taking a new
direction. Recent press
announcements suggest
the company is going for a
different approach regard-
ing both their PR tactics
and interaction with their
fanbase. An example of a
past success they had in
varying such tactics was
the “Road to Greatness”
campaign. The campaign
entailed a semi-truck con-
“Sony is going
for a different
approach
regarding
both their PR
tactics and
interaction
with their
fanbase”
“E3 has set the
gold standard
as a platform
for the
revealing of
big titles and
IPs”
taining VR stations and
PS4’s setting up one-day
showcases and tryouts,
whilst being driven from
one state to another across
the US. The campaign
has worked surprisingly
well, with a large amount
of support from the
fanbase as well as a great
amount of exposure to the
wonders of VR; and all its
motion sickness.
Sony may also be
taking a tactical approach
to this year and ate simply
reserving their IPs for
the upcoming year; given
the fact they’ve already
announced this year’s
heavy hitters: Last of Us
Part 2, Death Stranding
and Ghosts of Tsushima.
Business wise it would be
nonsensical to suddenly
mask over their other
announcements with
even more announce-
ments, given how that
would affect sales. There
could also be the other
depressing possibility that
Sony has run out of IPs,
and they just don’t have
anything for E3, which
is a rather anticlimactic
reason. Either way, E3
is quite the expensive
and resource demanding
convention, so it would
be reasonable for Sony to
make the cost-effective
decision of not turning up
to E3, given that they have
their own convention in
2019 and pending news
of the PS5. There may be
happy days for Sony, but
that may not be the case
for E3. In what seems to be
a growing trend, more and
more games developers
are making their own con-
ventions, with Microsoft,
EA and Nintendo being
examples of this. Which
begs the question, should
we be worried about E3?
Is this E3’s curtain
call? :
With so many different
gaming conventions
around, including
Gamescon, PAX and
Quakecon, how is it
possible that E3 is still
coping? Even looking
at the attendance of the
conventions E3 seems
to be in the danger zone
and not even in a good
‘Archer’ way. With Pax
East having an attend-
ance of 80,000+ people
and Gamescon raking
in the ticket money with
370,000 people, E3 just
doesn’t seem to compare
with only 69,000 people
attending this year’s
convention. But that’s the
thing, this is E3’s highest
attendance yet! So how
exactly has E3 stayed
afloat for so long? The
answer -- the legacy and
digital domination that
E3 holds. Ask any regular
gamer which convention
they watch to hear the
announcements of new
games and hands down
they’ll say E3. Gamescon
may have the numbers,
but it occupies a different
market that’s focused on
providing people with the
opportunity to actually
play games that are soon
to be released, as opposed
to revealing games that
are going to come out.
They occupied such a
market simply because E3
has set the gold standard
as a platform for the
revealing of big titles and
IPs. With rising attend-
ance it doesn’t seem like
E3 will be experiencing
any hardship. Regardless
of having their own con-
vention both Nintendo
and Microsoft still show
up to E3, because it’s
that potent as a platform
for news coverage. Sony
may be missing out but
they are saving their top
shelf material for later as
well as their money. Who
knows what will happen
to E3 in the coming years,
but it’s likely they’ll stick
around... as long as there
isn’t the improbable
disaster that is everyone
packing their bags and
leaving.
