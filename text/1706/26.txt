This week your heating
breaks down and your
room is freezing. Good
thing you took great notes
in first year; it makes
such great kindling.

HANGMAN
Dear Felicity,
Like many at Imperial, I’m a single man looking
to find a mate. It’s cuffing season and my wrists
are bare. How do I attract someone to spend
these lonely, long, dark evenings with? I used to
fill them writing into Imperial College Secrets,
but even that’s gone now. I’m a catch but these
wretched females keep rejecting me. All my
friends are coupled up. I need a companion and
I am so sick of being a third wheel. All I need in
my life is some symmetry.
Yours,
L. N. Lee

Hi Lee!
I say lower your
standards. Put yourself
out there! Did you know
our centrefolds used to be
used as dating ads? Maybe
if you write a letter to the
editor he’ll do you a solid.
It’s a bit old fashioned,
yes, but some old fash-
ioned attitudes are exactly
what we need sometimes.
You need some 20th
Century tactics to go with
that 20th Century entitle-
ment you’ve got.
Perhaps some new
hobbies will assist you in
your quest for courtship.
Have you considered
taking up a horizons
course? Women love
someone they think they
can have a conversation
with. They’ll talk over
you regardless, but it’s
important to front. Think
of it like that program-
ming language on your
CV that you’ve never
actually coded in. Bullshit
your way through the as-
sessment centre and deal
the rest of the problem
when you get to it.
If all else fails, go to
sports night and shout
as loudly as you can
for someone to go for a
coffee. When you inevita-
bely fail, you know you’ll
be in good company with
the rest of the building.
We’re all alone, so we’re
all in this together.
Big luv,
Felicity xoxo
Cuffing season
Help me Felicity, I’m sad and alone.
This week, you feel like a
million pounds. All those
cheeky Nando’s were
bound to catch up with
your waistline eventually.
This week you and your
friends go down to the ice
rink at the NHM.
Perfect; you get to ice-
skate and bowl people
over - a real 2-for-1 deal!
This week you write your
lab report last minute.
Again. Imagine going
into debt to submit low
quality work when you
could be Felix Editor and
get paid to do the same
thing?
This week, the stars are
all out of alignment for
you.
Oh wait, you just didn’t
calibrate your telescope.
This week you kick a
rock at a pidgeon trying
to shoo it away from you.
All his mandem gang up
on you and shit on your
pasta.
This week, nature calls
at the most awkward of
times. Unfortunately,
you’re in RSM and who
know where the damn
women’s toilets are. The
men’s can’t be THAT
bad, could they?
This week it’s your first
shift at the Union bar and
you’re confused. At no
point in the interview did
anyone mention mouse-
catching was going to be
a necessary skill.
This week you discover
that Silwood is a real
place that exists.
You thought it was just
what Alice Gast called
her off-shore bank
account.
This week you protest
against the sale of
continental breakfast at
the Union.
Brexit means Brexit;
none of that croissant
bullshit!
This week you have your
first Skype interview.
Exciting! Shame you
decide to do it in the
library, the couple going
at it in the background
isn’t really helping your
chances of employment.
This week, you get into
a fight with a Student
Activities Coordinator
over room bookings.
Literally.
Chairs are broken and
infographics are torn up.
