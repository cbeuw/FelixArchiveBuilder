urbulence in the
global financial
markets, par-
ticularly in the
technology sector, saw
equity sell offs, oil prices
tumble, and dollar swings
this week as concerns
over the global economy
intensified as investors
fear growing trade ten-
sions and weak corporate
earnings. FAANG stocks,
which had previously
powered the recent post
crisis bull run, had more
than $1 trillion wiped off
their market cap leaving
the tech heavy NASDAQ
benchmark heading for its
worst quarterly loss since
the turmoil that ensued
after the Lehman’s col-
lapse in 2008. Goldman
Sachs cut its price target
on Apple’s stock for a
third time this month from
$209 to $182, citing dete-
riorating Chinese demand
and a stronger dollar.
Goldman analyst Rod
Hall said, “The market
now points to Apple being
at the limit of their price
premium for the iPhone…
when pricing power is
lost, consumer technology
companies tend to lose
margins or market share
or both”. Consequently,
Apple stocks have fallen
24% since the early
October high, shedding
$265 billion of market
value; more the market
cap of Pfizer, Wells Fargo
and Chevron. This swan
dive reverberated through
the global markets, with

index declining 1.7% on

equity volatility climbing
well above its long-term
average. It also had an
unexpected effect on the
fixed income market, with
US treasury prices edging
of Oz, is how highly rated
bonds are beginning to
fail to provide their usual
safety, making portfolio
protection and hedging
techniques much harder.
Interestingly, the greatest
example that the market
entering a new regime
is how the “buy the dip”
technique (the dominant
motto of the post crisis
environment) is no
longer providing returns.
According to Morgan
Stanley, buying the S&P
500 after a week when
returns were negative had
been a profitable strategy
since 2002, but recently
“BTD” traders have been
caught out saying “While
2018 is clearly not a year
of recession, the market
is speaking loudly that
bad news is coming”.
Although few think a re-
cession is coming as early
as next year, Scott Minerd,
chief investment officer
at Guggenheim Partners,
says he is beginning to jog
-albeit not run- towards
exiting the market saying,
“The bottom line is that a
recession is coming, and
it is imperative to prepare
now for the period leading
up to the downturn”. It
is no surprise then that
the Federal Reserve has
been increasing rates
and shrinking its balance
sheet, lifting three-month
Treasury bills- the Feds
way of increasing its cash
reserves.
On a lighter note,
some investors note that
the recent volatility has
been healthy, finally
shaking markets out of
the dangerous inactivity
the Goldilocks post crisis
environment, where weak
growth kept inflation
at bay and money was
pumping out of central
banks. Additionally, an
uncorrelated market
providespotentialforlarge
alpha return for hedge
funds. Although the stock
market correction over the
past two months has hurt
a lot of investors, a small
group of bearish hedge
funds managers their
time has arrived. Crispin
Odey, founding partner at
Odey Asset Management,
has made gains of about
50% this year and 7%
this month, making it
one of the top performing
hedge funds this year. His
view is that downwards
market momentum is very
difficult to halt when it is
coupled with expensive
equity valuations, “the
only way it’s been halted
has been lower interest
rates, and that’s not an
option”.

higher towards the 3%
level. Rising US interest
rates have tripped up
the global economy this
year, with a large share of
the bond universe losing
money in 2018. Although
issuance has remained
strong, the Bloomberg
Barclays Multiverse has
lost $1.34 trillion of its
market capitalisation this
year. This is most likely
due to central banks paring
back monetary stimulus,
stopping programmes
such as quantitative
easing and rising interest
rates. Still parallel de-
clines in both bonds and
equities are rare since
stocks do better when
growth is robust and fixed
income markets thrive
poor economic condi-
tions. For example, in the
2008 financial crisis when
the global equity market
shrank by more than $18
trillion, the bond market
survived as investors were
desperate for the relative
safety it offers. These new
market conditions have
been coined by investors
as the unfamiliar “Land of
Oz”. Jim Smigiel, head of
portfolio strategies at SEI
Investments says “It is a
new regime. The entropy,
the uncertainty, feels more
acute right now”. One
major worry in this Land
