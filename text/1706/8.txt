We all know that the
best uses for lemons are
those we can devour:
lemonade, lemon pie,
and of course lemon
meringue... yum! But have
you thought of lemon as a
health hack? Discover 12
more uses below.
1) Fever
Lemon juice aids in
curing general sicknesses
such as flus, colds and
fevers. Lemons induce
perspiration in the body,
which helps to break
fever. Thanks to its
vitamin C content and
antiseptic properties, it is
perfect for resolving lost
voices, tonsillitis, and all
sorts of other respiratory
ailments you might catch.
Consume by drinking it
in a glass of warm water
with honey – basically
like warm lemonade?
2) Sore Throat
The anti-bacterial prop-
erties of lemon are helpful
in curing infections and
soreness in the throat. You
can simply imbibe lemon
juice with water or drink
lemon tea. Additionally,
lemon raises our body’s
natural immune system.
And don’t forget lemon’s
high vitamin C content
when you suffer from
these illnesses!
3) Nerves &
Troubled Sleep
At bedtime, it is ideal
to drink a lemon flower
infusion (if you can get
your hands on some, that
is). Put three of these in
boiling water, let them
sit a few minutes and you
have your infusion, ready
to calm your body and
drift you away...
4) Relaxation
Lemon is a great
aromatic agent that can
relax your feet if you use it
as a tool in a DIY spa.Add
lemon juice to lukewarm
water and dip your feet
in it. It will relax your
muscles and will help you
get rid of foot odour, as
well as soothe tired soles
and heal blisters.
5) Detoxification
Lemons are excellent
cleansers for our bodies;
they eliminate toxins,
purify, and are undoubt-
edly one of the best health
allies. Did you know
that having a large glass
of warm water mixed
with lemon juice in the
morning not only helps
in weight loss but also
helps your digestive tract
and liver? This alkaline
solution can be looked
upon as an overall body
detoxifier.
6) Cough
Heat a few teaspoons
of honey and add the juice
of one lemon in half a cup
of hot water. Drink the
mixture slowly and your
cough will disappear. In
addition, it is common to
use garlic cloves to aid
the miraculous benefits
of lemon - in this case,
cut two in half and let
them soak a few hours
in lemon juice. The
flavor (and your breath
afterwards) will seem a
bit strong, but eating these
lemon-flavoured garlic
cloves is an excellent and
unconventional method
for reducing coughs.
7) Immunity
Its nutritional composi-
tion composed of vitamins
C, B, and E, and its many
minerals, such as potassi-
um, magnesium, calcium,
and sulphur make lemons
an incredible strengthener
for our immune system.
They raise our white
blood cell count in the
long term.
8) Dental Care
Surprising as it may
seem with its acidity;
lemon juice is good for
maintaining dental health.
If you are suffering
from problematic gum
bleeding, apply lemon
juice to get rid of it (it
will sting, but for a good
cause). Lemon juice can
also provide relief from
toothaches and solve the
issue of bad breath.
9) pH Balance
To maintain and
upgrade your health,
it is necessary to keep
the body’s pH slightly
alkaline, and what better
option than lemons to
do so? The alkalinity of
lemons pushes our body
to attain the required pH
state, which resultantly
aids in improved general
heath and reduces risk of
certain diseases, such as
cancer.
10) Nosebleeds
Nose bleeding is a
common problem that
occurs mainly in summer
due to increased pressure
on blood cells. However,
lemons have shown to be
an excellent remedy for
stopping nosebleeds. You
can dip a cotton ball in
lemon juice and apply it
directly inside your nose
– unpleasant as it may
seem, it will stop your
nosebleed!
11) Travel
Sickness
If you tend to feel
sick when travelling,
lemon again comes to
the rescue. Dilute lemon
juice with water, and you
have a superb solution
for treating vomiting and
travel sickness. Nibbling
on a small wedge of
lemon can also cure such
disorders fast.
12) Insect Bites
This is an ancient
remedy where lemon juice
is applied on the affected
area to cure insect stings
and bites. Although the
effects are not likely to
be felt instantly, lemon is
believed to suck out the
poison, thereby curing
itching and pain in the
long term.
