Divest Imperial joins
universities across the
UK in protest as part
of National Day of
Action

D
ivest Imperi-
al, an Imperial
College Un-
ion-affiliated
environmental campaign
group, held an on-cam-
pus protest demanding
Imperial divests from
fossil fuels.
The protest, which took
place on Tuesday 20th
November, was part of the
National Day of Action
for Divestment. Targeting
universities across the
UK, including Oxford,
Cambridge, Leeds,
Aberdeen, Newcastle
and UCL, which have a
combined £600m in fossil
fuels, students across the
country came together to
demand our institutions
"act on the urgency of
Universities minister urges more fast-track degrees
year from an already over-
stretched budget), caps on
student numbers may be
reintroduced. Grants for
disadvantaged students
may also be reduced,
making higher education
inaccessible for students
from low-income back-
grounds. As Felix wrote
earlier this year, Imperial
is one of the worst uni-
versities when it comes to
recruiting students from
lower socioeconomic
backgrounds, with just
63.5% of entrants in
2016/17 coming from
state schools.
These considerations
are not likely to deter stu-
dents. Recent years have
seen countless politicians
trying to win the student
vote with promises about
maintaining or improving
the affordability of higher
education. And – as cases
of mental illness among
young people rise – the
prospect of graduating
with £50,000 of debt
exacts an incalculable
cost in terms of student
well-being and adds
further strain to health and
social care services.
Still, the general feeling
is that something must be
done. If not lower tuition
fees, then what?
One alternative would
be the re-introduction of
maintenance grants, rather
than loans. Almost half of
students struggled to pay
their rent, and their mental
health suffered as a result,
according to a recent Save
the Student survey. A third
of respondents also be-
lieved that difficulties in
meeting their living costs
adversely affected their
studies. While a return to
maintenance grants would
put a drain on Treasury re-
sources, the £500 million
cost estimated by the In-
stitute for Fiscal Studies is
considerably less than the
potential cost of lowering
tuition fees.
Many universities
would find ways to operate
without a third of their
tuition fee income. The
first cost-cutting measure
would likely be outreach
schemes to disadvantaged
communities, which uni-
versities are obligated to
fund with a proportion of
their tuition fee income.
This could be avoided
if universities reined in
excessive spending on
senior staff, which has
been well-documented
by Felix and other media
outlets following the
scandal of vice-chancel-
lors’ salaries.
The Augar review is
not due to report until
early 2019 and much may
change before then, but
students should not bank
on a reduction in tuition
fees any time soon.

the climate crisis" and to
"call out universities that
are behind the curve on
climate action".
Jeff Clark, the Presi-
dent of Imperial College
Environmental Society,
told Felix the following:
"No environmental
issue is more pressing
than climate change. I am
yet to hear a convincing
argument in favour of
continuing to fund the
fossil fuel industry."
Divest Imperial has
accused Imperial College
of being "complicit in
this crisis for too long"
and is calling for Impe-
rial to "fulfil its stated
purpose - working to
solve humanity's greatest
challenges" by ending
its "uncritical support for
climate-wrecking compa-
nies". The campaigners
wish to see "full divest-
ment" of Imperial's £8.9m
fossil fuel holdings.
This protest is just the
latest in a campaign of
student action which has
spanned four years and
shows no signs of abating.
Members of Divest Im-
perial have promised to
"keep protesting until Im-
perial College stands on
the right side of history,
removes its funding from
the fossil fuel industry and
re-invests in our future".
Despite over 1800 pe-
tition signatures, manage-
ment at Imperial College
London has previously
refused to move its
money, claiming that, "by
working with fossil fuel
companies, Imperial helps
to solve climate change".
Chris Wells, a campaigner
at Divest Imperial, called
Imperial out for what he
feels is hypocrisy, stating:
"As a PhD student
at Imperial working on
climate change, I find it
obscenely hypocritical
that my university is
funding the industry most
responsible for the crisis."
In a statement provided
to Felix on behalf of
Divest Imperial, Imperial
was accused of legiti-
mising "climate denial,
neo-colonialism and
violence" by continuing
to provide support (both
financial and through re-
search) to firms that "have
blocked climate action for
decades" as they "pursue
ever more extreme forms
of extraction incompatible
with the Paris Agreement
goals".
When approached for
comment, Naomi Pratt,
a campaigner at Divest
Imperial who recently
gave an interview to The
Guardian about universi-
ties' continued affiliation
with fossil fuel compa-
nies, said the following:
Students occupied the Sherfield building, with chants of "no more coal, no more oil,
keep that carbon in the soil" and "divest now" // Divest Imperial
Imperial students sound the alarm on fossil fuel
investments
Those on higher salaries
could save £500 each
year.
Some critics suggest
any reduction in tuition
fees will actively harm
students from less affluent
backgrounds.
If the decrease in uni-
versities’ incomes from
tuition fees is not covered
by the Treasury (which
would be forced to find
an extra £3 billion each

I concede defeat
P
roducing this
week's issue of
Felix started off
so well. So so
well... It was looking like
I might actually make it
home in good time on a
Thursday evening. Alas,
I must concede defeat.
After 22 years of trying,
I will never beat my
crippling procrastination.
From what was looking
like the earliest I'd ever
get the paper done by a
few short hours ago to
me sat here frantically
waffling once again so I
can send the paper off to
print only two hours after
the "print deadline". They
should have never told me
the print deadline was not
a firm one. That was the
first mistake. As you can
probably tell if you are
unfortunate enough to still
be reading this garbage, I
don't really have anything
to say. Once again.
This week's issue of
Felix sees the birth of
a new Sustainability
Section. This section
will be organised by the
Environmental society
and aims to provide
news on the environment
("Going on in the world
this week"), to give a
platform for discussion
and to popularise actions
which members of the
College community can
take on sustainability. If
Im honest, I was scepti-
cal about including the
Sustainability Section.
One question plagued my
mind... is it sustainable?
(Pardon the awful pun, it's
late and I'm very tired).
However, members of the
Environmental Society
have assured me that
there is a demand for
this amongst the student
body and there will be no
shortage of content in the
coming weeks.
In a similar vein, this
week we also reported on
a student protest held by
Divest Imperial demand-
ing Imperial divests its
£8.9m fossil fuel holdings.
This protest was picked up
2
by the lovely journalists
over at The Guardian and
they did a wonderful job
ofhighlighting just how
amateurish my attempts at
News articles are.
In other news, Tuesday
sees Imperial host its
first joint event with The
Times. As reported in last
week's Felix, Imperial and
The Times have launched
a collaboration which sees
staff and students receive
a year-long free digital
subscription to The Times
and Sunday Times. Tues-
day's launch event, "What
the Hell is Going on?"
promises to be a riveting
affair, hosted by political
satirist Matt Chorley. Uni-
versities minister, Sam
Gyimah, will also be in at-
tendance and there will be
free food and drink. There
are literally no downsides
here, so come along!
I've run out of things to
say now so all that's left to
do is awardAndy's section
of the week. This week,
it's the Music section! I
might be slightly biased
but I love to see my guys
winning. Music has been
awarded for putting up a
valiant fight against the
almost indomitable Arts
section. Congratulations!
“Imperial
needs to take a
long, hard look
at itself... and
decide if it is
serving people
or profit ”
"We're in a period of
ecological collapse and
global humanitarian
crisis, perpetuated in part
by companies whose
logos adorn this campus.
Imperial needs to take a
long, hard look at itself
and its strategic relation-
ships, and decide if it is
serving people or profit".
“One day, this
editorial will
be all pull
quote and
there's nothing
any of you can
do about it!”
