D
o you know
what the BBC
in BBC Music
stands for? If
you guessed ‘Bangers,
Bops, and Chunes’…
you’d be completely
wrong, but I’d applaud
your guess, as this is what
BBC Music provides
the British music scene
with daily. There’s a
huge spectrum of British
musicians who now dom-
inate the charts and are
firmly supported by the
BBC, allowing them to
maintain their presence in
the media. Interestingly,
what people perhaps don’t
know, is that many of the
musicians we see may
have risen to the heights
they’re at today thanks
to the help of the BBC
launching them onto the
scene via their dedicated
BBC Music Introducing
initiative. With the aim
of bringing together all
the supporters of Britain’s
unsigned musicians, art-
ists can upload their music
to the service in the hope
that Introducing provides
them with the exposure
they desire to kickstart
their career.
In the spirit of elevat-
ing the freshest faces in
the game, BBC Music
Introducing took over
Tobacco Dock in East
London to hold a three-
day extravaganza of live
music, industry sessions,
and interactive workshops
aimed at anyone looking
for a career in the music
industry: aspiring artists,
potential producers, and
dreaming DJs alike. We,
on behalf of Felix, were
lucky enough to attend
one of the days, exploring
the festival, and sampling
the plethora of master-
classes that the event had
to offer.
Imagine Willy Wonka’s
Chocolate Factory, but
instead of endless sweets
and chocolate, we saw
countless guitars and
keyboards. Instead of
rooms full of food-based
exploration, we experi-
mented with the newest
technology that music had
to offer. Instead of oom-
pa-loompas, we had some
of the most well-informed
names of the music
industry, from employees
at industry giants to the
artists themselves.
My first taste of one
of the masterclasses was
the ‘Making it in Pop
Music’ panel talk, a talk
which aimed to nurture
the creative direction of
budding pop artists. While
initially I was drawn in by
an impressive panel which
included Danny Jones
from McFly, it quickly
dawned on me that the
advice being given would
serve helpful for when
I finally realise I should
give up my maths degree
and pursue my love of
music.
Meanwhile, Jiangxu-
an’s reward for waiting in
one of the longest queues
for any event was a
cramped spot on the floor
for the ‘Art of Songwrit-
ing’ workshop, where the
likes of Jake Gosling (Ed
Sheeran, Shawn Mendes,
One Direction), Kieran
Shudall (Circa Waves)
and James Gillespie (Rag
& Bone Man) talked him
through the workflow
involved in coming up
with musical and lyrical
content. A unifying theme
was persistence – the
majority of the speakers
mentioned that it takes
years of practice and
endeavour before getting
noticed. Tips to aspiring
songwriters: always
have a guitar plugged in
and ready somewhere;
keep recording yourself
and don’t lose track of
your ideas; a good demo
always leaves room for
imagination.
Ali Tant from Polydor
Records, who works with
a remarkable range of
artists from Eminem to
The 1975, insightfully
commented, “the best
popstars are the ones who
aren’t ashamed of things
that fail”, which seemed
to resonate with the room.
The room was jampacked
full of eager faces and
wide ears which appeared
to absorb all the advice
given by the knowledgea-
ble speakers. This interest
only seemed to heighten
throughout the day as I
attended more talks such
as ‘Music & Tech: VR,
AI, Bots & Blockchain
Explained’ which talked
of a future of robot-led
music and virtual reality
concerts. In a later talk,
we heard Afro-Swing
giant Hardy Caprio talk of
how he balanced his uni-
versity work with making
#1 records; inspirational
to say the least.
Stephen Taverner,
current manager of
Mercury Prize winning
groups Wolf Alice and
alt-J (∆∆∆∆∆∆), brought
about some insights on
how these two bands dealt
with success, reminiscing
about the early days of a
cash-strapped alt-J with
low-quality instruments
which their songwriting
was distinctive enough
to transcend, and Wolf
Alice’s evolution in stage
presence and musical
confidence – Wolf Alice
recently embarked on
their first ever Asian tour,
and Stephen was espe-
cially pleased at the large
local fanbases the band
has garnered.
A climatic end to the
day brought the BBC
Radio 1Xtra Takeover
which treated us to a
handful of live acts. While
my West-Midlands heart
was slightly crushed on
hearing the news that
Lady Leshurr was too ill
to perform; we were not
left disappointed with en-
ergetic performances from
the likes of: Geko, Shakka,
Lotto Boyz, Donae’o, and
Chronixx, among others.
The highlight for me was
a performance from Nao.
I’d best describe her work
as a tasteful blend of Mura
Masa, Frank Ocean, and
SZA, so I was excited to
hear her perform songs
from her new album
Saturn.
It was clear to me
that the event forms the
musical foundation for
not only the expertise,
but also the inspiration,
of the next generation’s
musical talents. The best
of which I’m sure were
present over the three
days. Many people ex-
changed their details and
Instagram handles with
me (e.g. @alexmitcham
ahem) throughout the day
so I hope to keep an eye
on this flourishing talent
in years to come.
And guess what? We got free tickets. // BBC
