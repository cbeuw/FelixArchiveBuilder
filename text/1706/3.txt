“We have to
recognise
that it's not
a matter of
compromising
standards”
In conversation with Professor Stephen Curry
NEWS
Felix sat down with
Professor Stephen
Curry, the Assistant
Provost for Equality,
Diversity and
Inclusion, to reflect
on Imperial's Equality,
DiversityandInclusion
Strategy
Andy Djaba
Editor-in-Chief
W
ith the re-
cent pub-
lication of
Imperial's
Equality, Diversity and
Inclusion (EDI) Strategy
and Imperial's launch
of the Race Equality
Charter survey, Felix
sat down with Professor
Stephen Curry, for an
exclusive interview.
Felix: I wanted to
get your take on
the strategy for
Equality Diversity and
Inclusion. If you could
givesomebackground
to it: where did it come
from, the steps that
have been taken to
get it to the point
that it’s at now and to
describe the point that
it’s at now?
Stephen: Well the
point that it’s at now is
that it’s just been pub-
lished. Where did it come
from? It apparently came
from the creation of the
position that I occupy.
I wrote the strategy as
Assisant Provost for EDI
and that’s a new position
at the College. I started in
October last year, so I’ve
been in it just over a year.
It had also been sparked
by the institutional culture
review which happened
a few years ago and was
actually triggered by an
incident that happened
between the Men’s and
Women’s rugby teams.
Now, in the end, although
what triggered it was an
incident between student
societites, actually the
report focused largely
on the culture within
departments and the
working environment
for staff here. One of the
things they noticed is the
perception of many staff
is that Imperial is a highly
competitive working
environment- that’s kind
of what you’d expect
from an institute that’s
research intensive, that is
world class, that operates
in a globally competitive
market. But there was
a sense that... what was
missing was an emphasis
on collaboration, on
empathy, on actually un-
derstanding the pressures
that people work under
and the sorts of behav-
iours that can lead to and
engender.
I am really interested in
the culture of science and
how universities work and
the value that they offer to
society. They’re supposed
to be agents of social
mobility and, in a ways,
they’re not really doing
that nearly as well as they
could and should be. I’ve
spent a lot of time in the
first few months talking to
lots of different people at
all parts of the university
to get a sense of what
are we doing well across
this agenda and what are
we not doing enough
and that was the basis of
starting then to write the
strategy. The strategy was
developed with lots of
consultation with lots of
different people and one
other thing to appreciate
is, coincident with the
creation of this position,
the way that the College
oversees work on EDI
was changed and there are
now two primary com-
mittees that oversee that.
There’s an EDI strategy
group, which is chaired by
the Provost. I sit on that
but it also has the Faculty
Deans and there’s about
a dozen people on it, all
quite senior. That was
deliberately kept a rela-
tively small group so that
it had focused discussion
and executive authority.
In parallel with that, we
set up an EDI Forum and
that is deliberately a much
more representative body
and people from all over
the College, different
academic departments,
different administrative
departments, professors
and students are on it.
There’s lots of representa-
tion around the table
there. The forum I see as
a representative group and
a kind of listening post to
basically pool information
from ground level up. So
the forum was very much
involved in helping to
draft it as well. I came up
with a skeleton outline
in January, which was
discussed at the strategy
group and then it was
developed and then it
was discussed again at
the forum and then it had
another discussion at the
strategy group in May
and then a fully developed
version was then present-
ed to the Provost’s board
at the end of June for ap-
proval and then adoption.
Clearly, we want to be
as inclusive as possible so
that, whoever you are, if
you apply here and you’ve
got the wherewithal to
study the courses or to
do the research, then we
want you. There’s clear
evidence that, if you bring
people from other back-
grounds and perspectives,
that can help you generate
a much more creative
approach to how you re-
search, how you teach and
also helps to dictate what
you research, what you
teach. If we start asking
different questions then
people who don’t nor-
mally look to Imperial as
a place where they might
go might say, "actually the
stuff they’re interested in
is the stuff I’m interested
in" and so that becomes
then a pull on them.
Over the summer it was
refined and it was also dis-
cussed in the President’s
Executive groups. We got
a version that’s published.
We’ve been rolling it out
with announcements. Chi
Onwurah came on the
11th and I deliberately
invited Chi because
she chairs an all party
parliamentary group on
diversity in STEM, which
is newly created this year.
She’s also an alumna of
this university, She was
a woman at Imperial; she
was a black woman at
Imperial and she was the
only person in the room
of those characteristics for
a lot of the time. Didn’t
have a very happy time
at Imperial and is very
clearly invested in this
area and had said, basi-
cally, that a lot of Russell
group universities simply
aren’t doing enough yet
in terms of opening the
doors to underrepresented
minorities. If you invite an
MP, I kind of figured it’s a
good way to launch it and
show that we are really
interested in starting con-
versation about this and
I would like to try and
ramp up the number of
events that are promoting
prolonging this conver-
sation and getting people
involved in participating
We now have a strat-
egy. There are 7 major
elements to it, the “We
Will” statements detailed
in the document. The
document also then has an
action plan and the action
plan has owners who are
distributed all across the
College, all the way from
the President to Heads of
Department. Now this is
just a piece of paper at the
minute, and it was hard
enough work to do that, let
me tell you. But the hard
bit starts now because the
hard bit is delivery and
that’s where we need to
focus now.
Stephen Curry, Imperial's Assistant Provost for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion // Imperial College London
In a lot of places,
Imperial has the right
sentiment behind
what they say but it
almost comes across
as they’re paying
lip service to it... in
terms of actual things
happening, there’s
very slow progress if
any progress is made
at all. How do you
plan to implement the
"We Will" statements?
Some of it is in the
action plan. Some of it,
to be frank, we haven’t
worked out exactly how
we’re going to do it but
there are certain targets
that we want to try and
achieve so we have real
action. I’m very aware
that you can write a lot of
fine words in a strategy
and nice aspirations, and
I agree that in this space,
talking about EDI around
the higher educational
sector generally, not just
in the UK but across the
world, people have been
talking about these issues
for a long time. If you
talk to women academics,
they’re incredibly frus-
trated; we know what the
problems are to a large
extent but we don’t really
see a big pace of change.
One of the difficulties is
there isn’t a silver bullet
that solves this. What
we’re dealing with is a
society that has many
structural inequalities
built into it and we are a
product of that society.
Now, as a university, I
would like to think that
we were a space that actu-
ally challenged the norms
of society and says, "we
can do better", and start
to lead the conversation
in doing that. Oxford
and Cambridge attract a
lot of attention because
everybody’s heard of
Oxford and Cambridge,
so they get it in the neck
in the press in terms
of numbers of women,
numbers of black students
that they have, but our
numbers, I’m afraid,
aren’t really significantly
different from theirs. We
can be grateful for their
existence because they
take a lot of the heat, as it
were. We have to be very
clear-sighted and look at
our numbers and see what
it is that we’re doing. On
admissions for example,
we know we have issues
with attracting certain
minority groups and there
is, I would say, very much
a renewed determination
that we’re going to have
to change that.
are. Your A level results is
basically a result of your
innate abilities multiplied
by your social advantages
or disadvantages. I think
we have to recognise that
it’s not a matter of com-
promising on standards.
Increasing diversity is not
about saying “oh well,
we let in a few minority
students because it looks
good". That’s really not
the position we’re taking.
The strategy makes it
clear that there are groups
of talented students out
there that we’ve been
neglecting and that we’re
not really open to and it’s
about recognising that, ac-
tually, they’re every bit as
good as the students that
come here but we’re not
doing a good enough job
of recognising the talents
that they have. Now how
we do that is a compli-
cated process. Some of
it will be our admissions
processes, some of it will
be about actually going
out and doing outreach
and showing people that
you should be aspiring
to Imperial College, you
have got it in yourself.
There’s an issue with
not enough girls doing
physics for example and
that’s because they get
the message early on,
sometimes from their
parents, sometimes from
their teachers, that “girls
don’t do physics” and
nonsense like that. But
there are many other
areas where people get
that message and those
are things that we have to
fight against. So there has
to be movement across
broad fronts, which is
why the problem is deep
seated, the solutions are
multidimensional and
complex and I do hope
that the strategy gives us
a framework to be more
coherent and more joined
up in our approach. We
are going to take various
steps, we’re not entirely
sure that those are going
to be the right steps to
take. We will remain open
to challenge and, if we
get things wrong, then
we will hold our hands up
and say “ok that doesn’t
seem to be working, we’re
going to try something
else”. There’s an inherent
problem in any large
organisation that people
don’t know how it really
works. That’s a problem
of communication and it’s
a problem that we need
to tackle. People very
readily get very cynical
about “why is the univer-
sity doing this?”, “is this
just so we can produce a
nice, glossy brochure with
a picture of a disabled
person on the front of it or
a black member of staff?",
"is this just PR?”. I very
much hope it’s not. I am
determined as far as I am
able to make sure that this
is about real change. Very
much the ethos of the
strategy is that promoting
EDI is the responsibility
of everybody who comes
to work or study here. It’s
everybody’s responsibil-
ity from the President to
the very last undergradu-
ate who’s come through
our doors. It has to be
about community, it has
to be about the culture of
the place. We know there
are many issues we have
to tackle. There will be
endless arguments over
this. We will not move fast
enough for some people.
We will be moving too
fast for others that... don’t
really understand the
different experiences that
other people have. I think
that is one of the issues
in universities - they’re
dominated by white men.
One of the things I want
to do is to make sure those
other voices are heard.
You mention that
universities are
dominated by white
men. It’s kind of funny
that the person in
charge of EDI is a
white male.
You’re right, it does
feel slightly anomalous.
We produced a leaflet to
get members of staff to
complete the Race Equal-
ity Charter survey and it
had my face on it! It is a
bit odd and that is an issue
but I think there’s value,
at least temporarily, in
that you have somebody
who is a white man, who
is prepared to take these
issues seriously and to
speak to his colleagues
about it. One of the impor-
tant things I can do is to
help enable other voices
to be heard. I’ve been
shocked to learn about
the experience of other
people. From women
about how prevalent
sexual harassment is in
higher education. I have
no experience of it what-
soever but I know, from
talking to women, that it
is a big, hidden issue.
Universities are com-
munities, the word uni-
versity means community
of students and scholars
and I think we have, to a
degree, lost sight of that.
Because of the way that
government accounta-
bility is now enforced,
universities have become
more managerialist in a
way and a bit more cor-
porate, rather than a bit
more communitarian and
I am determined to try and
push things in the other
direction.
What does diversity
mean to you
specifically and what
are your priorities?
Diversity is about
recognising and valuing
difference and the fact
that people are different,
bring different things to
a university experience.
It’s also about us being
much more cognisant of
the fact that people can
be very different from us
but have really fantastic
things of value to offer
us and experiences and
perspectives and insights
from their lived experi-
ence that bring real value
to a university and clearly
have every bit as much
talent as anybody who
conforms to the “norm”
view. Inclusion is really
an important part of that
because it’s not enough
that you are getting people
in the door. You have to
make sure that, when they
are here, that they don’t
feel excluded in any sense,
that they’re not treated or
subject to microaggres-
sions of any sort. Things
like that... degrade the
day-to-day experience of
people who are generally
from underrepresented
groups and that’s a hard
problem to crack. We are a
product of a society that’s
fragmented in many ways.
Everybody has a
limited set of experi-
ences and actually one
of the great purposes of
university in the modern
age in a big metropolitan
centre like London ought
to be to enable people to
come together and we
do that. There’s a lot of
good stuff happening, it’s
not all doom and gloom.
Imperial is very interna-
tional and that’s one of
the great things about, I
would hope, being here as
a student is that actually
there is a good mix of dif-
ferent people. It’s not the
entire mix that we would
like necessarily but there
is that.
I have a slightly funny
position here. I’m Assis-
tant Provost but I don’t
have a big team under me.
In a way, I kind of almost
see myself as being ap-
pointed to a position as a
professional campaigner
within the university and
my job is to campaign and
persuade people that this
is important, this is why
we need to do it, there’s
real value here and to
negotitate that. The thing I
want to really achieve is to
make sure anybody who’s
in a managerial position
is really invested in this.
I just want to make sure
that everybody is talking
about these issues and
aware of them. Ultimately
it will be seeing a change
in number, I want to see
more women academics
in senior positions here,
I was to see more BME
staff in senior positions
here, I want more BAME
students to come here.
We also know that
the reality is, we are
losing out on talent and
that’s the argument that
I would always make
about striving to increase
diversity. We have lots
of privately educated
kids, lots of white male
students, many of whom
have had socio-economic
advantages even if they
didn’t go to private
school. But there are
many communities where
there are lots of bright
kids but, for one reason
or another, they simply
don’t look to Imperial as
a place that they would
go. They don’t see other
people who look like them
here and that puts them
off and we have work to
do to counteract that. It’s
not College policy yet but,
personally, I would like to
move to a situation where
we are doing a much
better job of providing
context sensitive offers
to students. I think if you
just think about “we will
take people on the basis
of their A level results
because that’s a good
measure of how good they
are”, that’s an incomplete
measure of how good they
