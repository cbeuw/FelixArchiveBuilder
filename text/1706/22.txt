T
he UK has
declared war
on single-use
plastic. Reusable
coffee cups are every-
where, with Imperial’s
cafes charging those with-
out one an extra 15p, and
plastic bags and straws
are looked upon with
horror. The government is
riding this wave of public
opinion, having imposed
a 5p levy on the former in
2015, and is in the process
of implementing an out-
right ban on the latter, as
well as a possible charge
on plastic takeaway con-
tainers. But the newfound
revulsion at these items
is primarily because they
are single-use; aren’t we
free to purchase all the
recyclable plastic we
want, so long as we do
the honourable thing and
put it in the appropriate
bin – a win-win for the
environment and our
conscience? As of 2018, it
turns out the answer is no.
Since 1992, China
has imported 45% of all
plastic waste intended for
recycling for use in its
manufacturing industry,
taking two-thirds of the
UK’s waste since 2012,
but in January 2018 it
announced it will stop
doing this by the end of
the year. The consequenc-
es of this are enormous,
as the non-exported
waste may be diverted to
landfill, making putting it
in a recycling bin nothing
but an empty gesture of
goodwill with no positive
environmental impact.
China has also increased
quality controls for other
waste such as cardboard,
which could cause local
authorities to reduce their
collection of certain types
of waste due to the content
of the bins failing to meet
these standards, thereby
becoming economically
unviable.
The very fact that the
UK and many other coun-
tries such as Japan, Aus-
tralia, and the US export
the majority of their
waste abroad may come
as a surprise; few of us
think about what happens
to our plastic bottle or
food packaging after we
‘recycle’ it. Apparently,
the UK government
doesn’t either, as there
appears to be no backup
plan to deal with the
restriction of the world’s
largest market for waste,
despite prior warnings
that such a situation may
occur. Nevertheless, this
is an opportunity for the
UK to develop its recy-
cling infrastructure by
investing in reprocessing
facilities, albeit on a much
shorter timescale than the
government might like.
It is also an opportunity
to adopt an even more
intolerant attitude towards
plastic waste, even
when it is bound for the
recycling bin. Single-use
food packaging makes
up 89% of exported
plastics, and while this
magical material has
revolutionised our ability
to store and transport food
due to its low cost and
physical and chemical
properties, its use must
be minimised. There has
recently been an increase
in popularity in some
circles of shops offering
products plastic-free, but
there is a need for major
retailers to step up and do

Advances
the same, as problems of
this magnitude require a
change of public behav-
iour only achievable if
plastic-free packaging is
commonplace and cheap.
Retailers are highly re-
ceptive to public opinion,
exercised through our
spending habits, so we
the consumers, armed
with the knowledge that a
large proportion of plastic
is now effectively non-re-
cyclable, must make an
effort to minimise our
purchase of it. Exactly
how to go about this is
another story – make sure

S
ince the 5p car-
rier bag charge,
the thought of
throwing away
a perfectly good plastic
bag is enough to make
most of us cringe. Now
imagine unknowingly
throwing away 80 plastic
bags every month. That’s
how much plastic the
average woman uses over
her period if she throws
away 20 disposables a
month! I’m not trying to
make women feel guilty;
growing up, disposable
menstrual products were
the only options I was
told about. It was only a
few years ago I stumbled
across the idea of men-
strual cups.
Menstrual cups are
medical-grade silicone
cups that you fold and
insert into your vagina to
collect menstrual blood,
and which you then empty
into the toilet twice a
day. They’re simple to
maintain: wash with
unscented soap between
uses and boil between
cycles.
Let’s do a calculation
(we’re at Imperial, you
gotta love the sums).
The average woman
menstruates for 43 years
of her life, and each year
she has 13 periods. That’s
559 periods – and if she
uses 20 pads a period,
that comes to 11,180 pads
being thrown away in her
lifetime! In the UK alone,
4.3 billion disposable
menstrual products are
thrown away every year.
These products take 500
years to decompose,
outlasting not only the
woman who had her
period but generations
after her too. They should
never be flushed down the
toilet anyway, but flushed
plastics still account for
8% of beach litter found
in the UK and can clog
sewers and have detri-
mental effects on aquatic
life. What’s more, if we
take into account that each
tampon or pad costs about
13p per unit, a woman
spends over £1400 on
menstrual products
throughout her life.
I’ve mainly been
talking about pads, but
tampons are just as bad.
Tampons contain bleach
which can leak into a
woman, and the cotton
fibers which can be left
inside the vagina have
been linked to cervical
cancer. If left in for too
long, they can even cause
Toxic Shock Syndrome
(TSS). Menstrual cups
collect blood rather than
absorb, so have never
been associated with
TSS, nor do they disrupt
vaginal pH levels like
pads and tampons. They
can also hold up to 3 times
more blood than a large
tampon, and only need to
be changed once every 12
hours. Women are able
to exercise comfortably
wearing a menstrual cup
and can go to sleep
without them leaking.
A menstrual cup is a
one-off buy lasting you 10
years and is readily avail-
able in high-street stores
such as Boots, and more
recently Tesco, being the
first UK supermarket to
stock menstrual cups.
TOTM menstrual cups
cost £20, have entirely
biodegradable packaging,
and are cruelty-free.
When starting off, looking
at a menstrual cup can be
daunting, but YouTube
has a wealth of tutorials
for how to fold them and,
like all new things, it takes
a bit of practice to master.
Despite being invented
in the 1930s, sadly it’s
only now menstrual cups
are becoming common
knowledge. Even if you’re
not a woman, you can still
take part in the discussion
about menstrual cups as
the benefits to the envi-
ronment help everyone.
How trashy is your period?
Menstrual cups – why you should care about periods even when you don’t have one.

China postpones reversal of ban on trade of tiger and rhino products.
C
hina has post-
poned previous
plans to lift the
2 5 - y e a r - o l d
ban on the sale and use
of rhinoceros horn and
tiger bone for Traditional
Chinese Medicine
(TCM), following an
international furore. This
announcement comes
two weeks after the State
Council’s decision in
October to reverse the
1993 ban on the sale,
import, export, and use of
tiger and rhino products,
in order to allow their use
for “medical research or
in healing” from farmed
rhinos and tigers in gov-
ernment certified TCM
hospitals. Environmental
activists, conservation
NGOs and experts
criticised the Chinese
government, saying the
decision would have a
“devastating impact” on
wild populations of the al-
ready endangered species.
StateCouncilExecutive
Secretary-General Ding
Xuedong did not give any
reasons why the reversal
has been postponed and
did not refer to the global
response. He said the “old
ban remained in force”,
but did not specify if this
would be temporary or
permanent.
The announcement to
allow the trade of farmed
rhino and tiger parts for
TCM indicates that the
Chinese government
values wildlife exclusive-
ly as products for human
consumption, no matter
how iconic or endangered.
It contradicts President
Xi Jinping’s efforts to
improve China’s reputa-
tion on the environmental
front and the country’s
total ban on the trade of
elephant ivory in January
2018.
The lifting of the ban,
if it proceeds, will directly
support the barbaric tiger
farming industry of China
and South East Asia, and
it comes soon after South
Africa’s recent legali-
sation of the domestic
trade in rhino horn,
supporting rhino farmers.
Farming supporters say
that availability of farmed
tigers and rhinos for use
in TCM will alleviate
the poaching pressure
on wild populations, but
conservationists argue
that it will only inflame
the global poaching and
smuggling crisis that is
already threatening to
wipe out the <30,000
rhino and the <4,000
tigers left in the wild.
Not only will this support
the fourth most lucrative
international criminal
trade after drugs, weapons
and human trafficking, it
will also put the lives of
countless conservationists
and rangers at risk in the
war on poaching.
Supporting these
tiger and rhino farms
will stimulate demand
for these products that
will certainly exceed the
supply that farms are
able to generate. It also
undermines the efforts to
eradicate demand entirely
and could erase the stigma
associated with exploiting
a globally loved, critically
endangered species. In

the tiger farms, tigers are
speed-bred like livestock
and killed to order. Many
are also open to the public
under the guise of enter-
tainment, where unknow-
ing tourists can handle
tiger cubs or pose for
photographs with sedated
and restrained adults.
Although much of the
demand for tiger bone for
TCM comes from China,
Vietnam is also one of the
largest consumers of tiger
parts; tiger bone paste, a
traditional medicine, is
a uniquely Vietnamese
product. While the Vi-
etnamese trade in tiger
parts is currently illegal,
China’s decision will
certainly influence the
South East Asian legal
atmosphere concerning
the commodification of
tigers.
The latest development
is only a delay in the
possible ban reversal;
environmental activists
and conservationists must
“Supporting
tiger and
rhino farms
will stimulate
demand
for these
products that
will certainly
exceed the
supply that
farms are able
to generate”
wait anxiously for further
updates from Beijing.
In this age of ecocide
and global biodiversity
devastation, it is time to
abandon the outdated and
scientifically invalid prac-
tices in traditional medi-
cines that are exploiting
and driving the decline of
endangered species.
The Chinese NGO
WildAid captures the
sentiment of many with
their slogan “没有买卖
没有杀害” (“When the
buying stops, the killing
can too”).
