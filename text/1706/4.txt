G
rit went Brit
this week.
We’ve been
so busy with
the recent collapse of the
UK government that US
news seemed to have been
swept well under the rug.
This is fine by me - no
news is good news as far
as America is concerned.
There’s the odd morsel -
Ivanka Trump’s emails;
Nancy Pelosi being the
controversial Speaker of
the House frontrunner;
Ocasio-Cortez dunking
on people on Twitter.
Otherwise, the radar
has been quiet. Well,
hey, more time to watch
Maybot run act_human.
exe - it’s impervious to
satire because it couldn’t
get more ridiculous!
Alas, this is not (yet) a
column about UK news.
Fuck you! I’m gonna
analyze the shit out of a
big pile of nothing for half
a page.
So. Ivanka’s emails.
Surprise! She’s been using
a private server for her
government business.And
yeah, obviously, she’s in
government strictly by
way of nepotism, she has
no qualifications, etc etc.
That’s not the funny bit.
The funny bit is that this
is exactly what Trump was
shouting “Lock her up!”
about - Clinton’s emails
on a private server. Hy-
pocrisy - who would’ve
thought? And then she
has the nerve to claim that
she didn’t know this was
against policy. Fuck off.
I say drag her in front of
the House and make her
testify for four hours. Now
that would give me some-
thing to talk about. In the
meantime, the Trumps are
hypocrites and this should
be a shocker to nobody.
If this, in fact, was a
shocker to you, I would
recommend a consult
with a proctologist - they
may be able to locate your
head.
Okay, that’s one done
and dusted. Next up:
Pelosi. Well, turns out
there aren’t any good
challengers for the gavel.
This is gonna play out
exactly like I don’t want.
It’s not the worst - she’s
a competent politician,
and fairly liberal. I mean,
she’s occupied the post
before. Chuck Schumer is
objectively worse. And, to
be fair to her, one of the
reasons she’s so poorly
liked is because she’s
not winning in districts
that went for Trump;
she’s the boogeyman, the
archetypical Limousine
Liberal, come on high
from the ivory tower to to
tell everyone to knock the
racism off. What a bother!
Well, if Pelosi actually
adopts leftist policies,
instead of clinging to the
neolib fantasies of yes-
teryear, she has a fighting
chance of being decent,
on a raw ideological level.
She’s also done the job
before; we can be assured
of her base competence.
As FiveThirtyEight
points out, arguments
about her legislative
competency are over-
blown. It turns out - even
back in the early Obama
years - she never really
had that much to do with
Dem performance in the
House. Standard polling
fare - incumbent president
approval rating, economic
performance, and the
like - had more to do with
electoral wins than Pelosi
as a figure.
For a brief moment, she
was challenged by Martha
Fudge. Nobody can take a
name like that seriously,
though. She dropped
out Tuesday after Pelosi
offered her a position
in Her House. Who
would’ve seen a thing like
that coming in politics?
Ah, whatever. We’ll
work with what we got.
And we got someone
great in Ocasio-Cortez
- best Twitter feed in the
House. And I guess a few
gaffes. Who cares? I also
love watching column-
ists mansplain how the
economy works to her;
she did a fucking degree
in it, then went to work in
a bar, because that’s what
it’s like to graduate from
college nowadays. Sorry,
boomers - if you fucked
up the economy that
badly, you don’t get to
be condescending about
economics.
Here’s a good one.
Trump’s been ducking an
interview with Mueller
for a year or so now,
because obviously Trump
will perjure himself the
moment he opens his
mouth. This is what
Trump’s lawyers know,
what onlookers know,
and what Mueller knows.
Trump’s legal team has
been going back-and-
forth with the investigato-
rial team; they eventually
settled on written ques-
tions (because then Trump
can do what his lawyers
say). Well, apparently,
the answers to Mueller’s
questions were submitted
last Tuesday, according
to Trump. No news what
the answers - or even the
questions - were. Guess
we’ll just have to wait.
So, the probe creaks
further on. No new news
yet - besides the leaked
Assange indictment -
probablysothenewHouse
can sit, or at the very least,
until Whitaker recuses
himselfrom the probe or
is otherwise incapacitated
(DO YOU THINK THIS
IS THE FIRST TIME
I’VE CALLED FOR
POLITICAL VIOLENCE
IN THIS COLUMN?
THINK AGAIN, PAL.)
In summary, a boring
week. Very little has
happened.
S U R P R I S E ,
BITCHES. You thought
this was only going to
be US news? Well, the
Grit here is on it. Can’t
wait until Arlene Foster
decides to pull the plug on
May’s life support. Can’t
believe they’re stupid
enough to not want funky
new rules with interacting
with the rest of the UK -
they could’ve been the
link between the EU and
the UK, and made mad
money in the process.
Unfortunately, the party is
run by chucklefucks.
Anyways, May is a
dead woman walking.
My money’s on a dream
scenario - that she tries
to ram her deal through
Parliament, resigns like
Cameron did, and we’re
left with a new referen-
dum or general election.
No matter what, though,
she’s pretty fucked.
How’s that for insight-
ful analysis? This is just a
gossip column now. Peace
out, dudes.
Never thought this would be relevant again - this is from 2011, the last time Pelosi was Speaker. // Pete Souza
