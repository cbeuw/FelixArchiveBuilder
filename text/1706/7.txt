A new way to say ‘Hello!’ to the World of coding
P
rogramming is,
for those who
don’t know any-
thing about it, a
mysterious and intimidat-
ing subject. However, at
any point in our careers,
we might be placed in
a situation where some
coding knowledge is
needed. And not only
there: it is enough to look
at the media, or more
specialized websites to be
confronted with technical
words, such as algorithms,
machine learning, data
science.
Whatever the reason, it
is never too late to learn.
And no need to undertake
year-long courses that
will not give a proper
insight into the applica-
tions of coding. An online
resource, SmartStack.me,
developed by students
in Imperial, is targeted
at those who would like
to produce their own
applications but may not
have the confidence to get
themselves started.
SmartStack.me is
a recent initiative.
Launched at the beginning
of this academic year, it
offers free opportunities
to quickly get started
and learn how to code.
Developed originally by
3 Medic students in fifth
year after spending their
intercalated Bachelor
year in the department of
Bioengineering, they have
the personal experience
of learning a completely
new subject and learn to
think “the engineering
way”. By now, the team
have expanded, and
comprises students (most
from Imperial) with
backgrounds such as Des
Eng, Geophysics and
Biological Sciences. Point
to note: no computing
student (yet)..
The concept of the
website is simple: it
provides a quick guide-
through the concepts
of coding and initiates
the user to the Google
Collaboratory text editor,
basically a free Jupyter
Notebook (allows user
to code in Python in
code cells and mixes it
with text cells). Google
Collaboratory works like
most Google products:
it is available online,
accessible to anyone with
a valid google address and
is sharable on Drive.
SmartStack.me helps
those with no previous
programming experience
through the Google
Collaboratory notebook.
Engaging, it is illustrated
with screenshots and very
clear and concise informa-
tion that anybody would
wish had in labs. After the
initiation to the notebook,
learning takes place by
straight away tackling
practical applications:
Data Science with Breast
Cancer Data, Machine
Learning with Chest
X-rays, SIRA Criteria
Calculator using a simple
program. Key to success:
“cool and trendy words”:
Machine Learning, data
analysis, all of that mixed
with the life-changing
vocabulary of medicine,
provides the perfect blend
to an interesting online
resource.
Now, I would like
to make a point. Not
everyone can instantly
become an expert pro-
grammer, specialist in a
programming language.
However, I believe it is
important to make coding
more accessible, to people
from all ranges and sexes.
Simple programs are what
separates nowadays sci-
entific research to the one
of last centuries. It would
be a missed opportunity
to spend so much time
manually analysing data
when super-fast comput-
ers can help us make the
task faster. So, to those
feeling too intimidated
by coding to start their
own applications, do not
let this slow you down. It
is never too late to learn,
develop your own appli-
cations and projects, and,
eventually, change the life
of many.

This week in the tech section, we will talk about an initiative lead by Imperial students to make code learning
accessible and entertaining to students from all backgrounds.
