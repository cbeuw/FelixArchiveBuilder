Nine Dutch Guys Bring the Heat to Blustery Camden
J
ungle By Night may
not be a name on
everyone’s radar -
but they more than
should be. The nine-piece
instrumental collective,
hailing from Amsterdam,
has a sound that lies
somewhere in the middle
of jazz, afrobeat (I’m talk-
ing your uncle’s favourite
Fela) and funk. The group
has been steadily making a
name for themselves since
forming in 2009, playing
everywhere from smaller
venues like the Duke of
Cumberland in Whitstable
to renowned festivals like
Pinkpop, North Sea Jazz
and Glastonbury. Having
spent their down time
between albums scoring
the stage production of
The Jungle Book, the
boys descended on the
sold out Jazz Cafe last
Friday, to celebrate the
launch of their 5th album,
Livingstone, having
previously teased only a
handful of new tracks at
their last London show in
March.
Opening the show
with an incredible solo
from trumpeter Bo Floor,
it seems apparent that
with each album, their
sound has become more
refined and the multicul-
tural influences are more
readily heard. This album
is undoubtedly more
global and anthemic, with
songs like “The Fog”,
and “Spectacles”, parts 1
and 2, sounding like they
could be taken straight off
a spy thriller soundtrack.
Overall, this new album
takes on a decidedly more
dance vibe than its prede-
cessor The Traveller.
That being said, the
spirit of what makes a
Jungle By Night show a
Jungle By Night show
was still there: with
each member getting
their moment to shine
with solos, dismantled
trombones, djembe
breakdowns, and more
jumping than is probably
advisable.
Whilst taking a quick
breather to chat, trombon-
ist Ko Zandvliet explained
that they wanted to capture
the essence and the heat
of the previous Dutch
summer, even going so far
as to record ambient bird
sounds at the countryside
house where the album
was made, on songs such
as “Hangmat”. So if the
plan was to make a hot
album, a party album, a
get-up-and-dance album,
then judging by the crowd
that night, they more than
succeeded.
The band closed out the
show with a new interpre-
tation of their thundering
classic “Attila,” proving
once again why they’re
worth seeing again and
again. Go alone, go with
a crew, either way you’ll
have a great time, because
their infectious energy
makes Jungle By Night an
act not to be missed.

JUNGLE BY NIGHT
Marie Davidson pours out her soul
W
hile Marie
Davidson’s
albums have
always been
personal, Working Class
Woman leaves a different
feeling. She said that it is
“an album where I have
started to work with my
psyche, trying to access a
level of my consciousness
that I was not aware of
before.”
And indeed, it reads
as her most personal and
diverse album to date.
The album begins on
what could first appear
as its conclusion. Marie
Davidson aligns, one after
the other, remarks and
questions that could be
(and probably are) made
by her fans. On a reason-
ably chaotic background
she asks “so, frankly, is
this album about taking
risks?” and between lines
that insist on the lack of
humanity that some fans
might have towards her,
she repeats to herself
“Who are you?”. This
seems to be what this
album is about. It does
involve taking risks but it
is mostly a self reflective
album where Marie takes
us on a subconscious
poppy dream.
Through the diverse
track listing she alternates
between more fun and
funky sounds like in ‘So
Right’ (the type of song
that you dance to at a
house party and to which
you don’t pay much atten-
tion), and chaotic tracks
where the lyrics barely
make any sense anymore,
and screechy electronic
samples that make you
want to curl up in ball
like in ‘The Tunnel’. This
track features French and
English in what appears
to be disarticulated self
reflections where she talks
about ‘The Tunnel’, a
distressing dark environ-
ment in which she needs
to dig by herself to come
out stronger. The power
of this track lies in the
strength of the lyrics that
suddenly make sense
again when she seems
to gain back lucidity and
says in French (translated)
“I hadn’t understood that
I can’t love if I don’t
love myself / love is not
a reward you get after
having suffered / love is
a gift”. This spills out in
between chaotic sentenc-
es that don’t quite make
sense (although her lyrics
are so pictorial, one still
needs to build their own
interpretation) and these
words stand out crystal
clear and strike as a punch
in the stomach.
But don’t let me give
you the wrong impres-
sion, both the strength
and weakness of Working
Class Woman is the mix of
tracks that can be as fun as
‘Work it’ (a weird poppy
song where she acclaims
hard work and self love in
a funny and frankly quite
sexy fashion) and as deep
as ‘The Tunnel’ or ‘The
Psychologist’ (of which
the topic remains left to in-
terpretation). This makes a
diverse record which does
not feel especially heavy
but is indeed a bit of an
emotional rollercoaster.
Marie Davidson offers
us forty-three minutes in
her head where we get to
witness everything from
uplifted and carefree to
darker feelings. What
she means isn’t always

Courtney Barnett tells us how she really feels
Frenetic Australian singer-songwriter Courtney Barnett tears up Brixton as part of her Tell Me How You Really
Feel tour. Striking a balance between tenacity and tenderness, her new material stikes a chord with audiences.
C
ourtney Barnett
has been crafting
witty, mid-paced
indie gems for
half a decade; on a mild
Wednesday evening
she treated Brixton to a
well-deserved outing of
her latest material.
After an all-Australian
warm up roster, fea-
turing the three-guitar
jangle-juggernaut that is
Rolling Blackouts Coastal
Fever (think Interpol
meets Cream), Courtney
Barnett took to the stage
in front of a mostly mid-
dle-aged crowd at the O2
Academy.
Barnett’s latest album
may brim with the same
high-octane energy as
2015’s Sometimes I Sit
and think…, but as the
oozing groove of ‘Hope-
fulessness’ emerged from
a cacophony of feedback;
it became apparent that
there was more to her
work than a casual Spotify
listen would suggest.
Barnett and her cohort
were there not for the
vain theatrics, but for
the music. Each member
focused largely on their in-
strument, coaxing out the
most that each song could
give, while four-thousand
heads bobbed along. The
result was a powerful
haze that simmered and
bubbled beneath the cute
melodies and tongue in
cheek wordplay for which
Barnett has made herself
a name. In instrumental
breaks the band’s energy
boiled over, wringing the
most out of their simple
arrangements.
Many crowd members
were already mouthing
along as Barnett crooned
“take your broken heart
/ turn it into art…”. Her
band, feeding off the
energy that filled the
academy, remained effort-
lessly cool, while eliciting
increasing excitement
from its spectators. Roars,
whoops and whistles
would erupt as Barnett
stumbled her way across
the stage, bent double over
her guitar after delivering
another unflinching verse.
Her vocal performance
was strong throughout
the night, capturing the
same character and power
found on her studio cuts.
Midway through the
set, opener Laura Jean
returned to the stage to
provide sax and vocals
(uncannily similar to
those of Courtney herself)
for a cover of the Go-Be-
tweens’ ‘Streets of your
town’; another homage
to the Milk! record label
owner’s Aussie roots.
Barnett might have been
better suited to cover one
of her peers - Julien Baker,
or long-time partner Jen
Cloher perhaps – as it
became evident that the
crowd was not particular-
ly familiar with the track,
and a lull ensued.
Passion from the
crowd quickly returned as
Barnett launched back into
her own material. ‘I’m
not your mother, I’m not
your bitch’, the audience
bellowed with relish, the
raucous anti-snob anthem
clearly a fan favourite.
‘Nameless, Faceless’
and its effortless handling
of internet critics and
gender politics in one
fell swoop was another
choice cut. Ms. Barnett’s
impossibly quotable
lyrics, “Men are scared
that women will laugh at
them / women are scared
that men will kill them”
and “I could eat a bowl of
alphabet soup / and spit
out better words than you”
were certainly not lost on
her adoring audience.
Friends exchanged
knowing grins at each
lilting one-liner.
After a sublimely
chosen setlist, parading
the singer’s most beloved
tunes, the crunching riff
of ‘Pedestrian at Best’
pushed Brixton into the
beautiful chaos of dance.
Nothing was left to be
proved for Barnett and her
band, they had managed
to add something beyond
words to what was already
a set of very strong songs.
Readers would be advised
to catch Barnett and her
crowd next time they pass
through London.
