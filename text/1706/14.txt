music is not your thing,
don’t worry, the festival
also features Late Night
Proms, which I can’t
recommend enough. Over
the years I have seen the
likes of Jarvis Cocker,
Nils Frahm, Quincy Jones,
Jacob Collier, Stormzy,
Laura Mvula and Leo
Pellegrino playing with
an orchestra as part of this
series. Watch out for the
shows conducted by Jules
Buckley, they are always
pure gold!
Join young people
schemes
Some of the most pres-
tigious London venues
offer generous schemes
for people between 16 and
25 (sometimes 30) years
old. Young Barbican is a
free membership scheme
that gives large discounts
on tickets to most events
and you’re never charged
a booking fee. Sometimes
they even have free events.
So there you go – for very
little money you can enjoy
wonderful artists in one of
the London’s most famous
venues – the Barbican
Centre. I saw Tim Hecker
there for only £5 in Sep-
tember. Another pearl of
brutalist architecture –
Southbank Centre – also
warmly welcomes young
people to their buildings.
They offer probably
the widest range of free
events and they always
have a limited number
of student tickets with
25% discount. Moreover,
you can sign up for their
“under 30 scheme”. Every
two weeks you will be
sent an email with the
promo code to get free or
£10 tickets for selected
events.
Going further east
into more hipster parts
of London, RichMix in
Shoreditch offers a Mixer
membership for a fiver.
You can get free tickets
to some of their shows,
if you’re quick enough.
Although, don’t expect
any big names here.
On the other hand, Get
In members can get £5
tickets for some of the
shows at Roundhouse.
(I’m focusing on music
here, but these member-
ships give you discounts
on other things too, such
as cinema, exhibitions and
theatre).
Download apps
You may want to
download a few apps to
save some pennies. If
you’re a classical music
geek, then get Student-
Pulse and you will get
access to classical music
concerts across London
for no more than a tenner.
If you’re planning on
seeing big names and
decide to spend those
£60 on Arctic Monkeys,
consider buying it through
Dice if possible – you
will at least save a couple
quid on the booking fees.
Dice’s fees are much
lower than other ticketing
agencies and every now
and then they put on sales,
which means you can save
even more money. And
if the event is sold out
and your last resort is a
second-hand ticket – get it
through Twickets – don’t
get ripped off by ViaGoGo
scammers. Twickets is a
reliable reselling platform
supported by many artists
allowing tickets to be sold
only for face value or less.
Take part in compe-
titions and random
draws
“You never win these
things” people say, but
you often find they’ve
actually never tried or
gave up after one failure.
There are a lot of websites
that try to organise your
free time and promote
cool things to do in
London. They often have
free tickets to shows to
give away in competitions
or promo codes for dis-
counts. So keep an eye out
for offers from TimeOut,
London Calling, Mr Hyde
etc. If you sign up to their
newsletters you will stay
updated about what’s
happening in London and
know about free oppor-
tunities. The drawback
is that your mailbox gets
filled with useless shit as
well. But it can be worth
it - that’s how I got to
see Massive Attack for
free at BST festival in
Hyde Park. Follow your
favourite artists on social
media, they also post
about free giveaways for
their shows.
I also strongly recom-
mend signing up for BBC
audiences. They record
concerts of all kinds
(ranging from classical
through jazz to rock),
radio, and TV shows.
They need to fill up their
studios with an audience
somehow and they do that
through random draws.
You just need to apply. I
was lucky enough to be
in the audience for one of
the episodes of Later…
with Jools Holland (after
about 2 years of applying
though, so be persistent!).
Work or volunteer
Last, but not least, if
you don’t have money
but do have time, a good
option is to volunteer at
festivals. It’s not ideal, as
sometimes you’re not able
to see your favourite acts,
but you can at least watch
some gigs as a reward for
your work, and you get
the chance to be close to
the action and spend time
in areas not accessible to
regular customers. You
can also try to get a job
at one of the venues and
get paid whilst also being
able to catch a glimpse
of what’s happening on
stage. This is basically
what happened to my life
after graduation.
That’s it from me. Now,
go and enjoy some live
music, there really is no
excuse not to!
shops like Rough Trade
also host gigs, especially
on Record Store Days,
though sometimes it
means you have to buy
something from them.
If you fancy listening to
some classical or chamber
music, then visit London
churches which often
organise free concerts or
visit our RCM neighbours.
Go to festivals
London hosts loads
of festivals. During the
summer plenty of open-air
events happen all over the
city and some have free
entry, like the Waltham-
stow Garden Party and the
Korean Festival in Trafal-
gar Square, so keep your
eyes open for those. The
currently ongoing London
Jazz Festival has the
whole lot of free shows
in its programme. And
let’s not forget about the
BBC Proms. The biggest
classical music festival
in the world that offers
75 concerts over two
summer months happens
just across the road. You
can enter the grand au-
ditorium of Royal Albert
Hall for a mere £6 and be
blessed with world-class
performances. If classical

W
hen I came
to London
four years
ago, I
was far more excited
about the capital’s rich
music scene than I was
about starting university.
Naturally, I expected
life in the big city to be
more expensive than the
Polish countryside. Little
did I know, however, the
size of the difference was
far greater than I could
have imagined. Having
barely enough money to
survive as an Imperial
student I couldn’t even
think of buying expensive
tickets to gigs. It felt kind
of bittersweet – I was
finally so close to all these
iconic venues and my
favourite artists, yet they
remained so out of reach.
Nevertheless, I was keen
to explore the new sonic
landscape I found myself
in. My growing interest in
world music led me to re-
alise that gigs of this kind
were usually pretty cheap
(if not free!) and the vibe
is always great. You could
get unbelievably high
quality for low prices,
so of course I started
exploring options there.
Like with everything else
in life, the first step is all it
takes to get the ball rolling
and soon I learnt about
numerous venues offering
free gigs across various
genres and ways to get
discounts.
Now, after 4 years
of studies at Imperial
College filled with hard
work and intense research,
I can say with confidence
that I possess a wealth of
knowledge about cheap
gigs in London, which I
am generously deciding to
share with you, dear poor
student, in this article.
Here are my tips on
how to get the most out
of London scene without
spending a fortune.
Join Alternative
Music Society
Start here. It’s the best
society at Imperial. (I’m
not at all biased, I definite-
ly didn’t spend half of my
time at Imperial being on
the committee…). AMS
sells subsidised tickets to
gigs, but most importantly
you’ll meet cool people
who share your passion
for music and can help
you stay updated about
everything music. Also,
watch out for the events
organised by other soci-
eties. Jazz&Rock holds
regular events where you
can listen to Imperial’s
very own student bands at
the Union for free or for
a couple of quid. We also
have orchestras, choirs,
acapella groups etc. who
perform regularly, so if
you want to experience the
artistic side of Imperial
and support your friends,
go and explore what Beit
venues have on offer.
Visit small venues
Enjoying live music
from the comfort of a
campus sounds like a nice
option. It’s easy to limit
yourself to the Imperial
bubble, but by all means
try not to! Once you feel
comfortable with your
new home and have made
new friends, get out of
South Ken and explore.
There are plenty of pubs
in London that host live
rock/blues/jazz bands
and don’t always charge
for entry (and if they do
it’s a very small fee), for
example: The Old Blue
Last, The Shacklewell
Arms, The Blues Kitchen,
Ain’t Nothin But… the
list goes on. Some record
