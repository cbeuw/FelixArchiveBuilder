IC Triathlon take on the Hillingdon Duathlon
With the incentive of a mug, sixteen Imperial students head to the Hillingdon duathlon and gain a podium spot

T
he Hillingdon
Duathlon is one
of the favourite
events in the
Triathlon calendar, not
only is it a nearby, be-
ginner-friendly, closed
circuit duathlon – but
you also get a mug for
entering. Win win. The
race consists of 2-mile
run, 10-mile bike and then
another 1-mile run. The
men’s race was an hour
earlier than the women’s,
so the 10-strong male con-
tingent had an inhumane
5:30am alarm. With the
weather looking dreadful
for the whole morning,
moral was understandably
low as we met cold, wet
and tired at 6:10am. After
an uneventful journey we
made it to the race track at
Hillingdon. Undeterred by
the extremely expensive
bikes we saw on arrival,
we racked our own and
registered.
The race and predicted
downpour started bang on
time at 8am and the men
set off to run two laps of
the track. The field was
strong and Hillingdon Tri-
athletes – on their home
turf – wanted to prove
themselves against the
Imperial team. Setting off
at a storming pace was no
deterrent for Matt Ryan as
he showed us the quality
in army fitness training.
Onto the bike and Matt’s
lead became short lived as
competition arrived in the
form of ‘rocket’ Romain.
Romain has the aerody-
namic footprint of a paper
plane, and combined with
the wattage cottage that
his legs are, he won 2nd
place. Luke Whiting, an
exceptional all-rounder
was also up in the top 5.
The seemingly endless
headwind on the back
straight was loudly
chastised by everyone,
after all, everyone knows
shouting at the wind
makes you go faster. The
most difficult part of the
race was not in battling
the headwind as it turned
out but in counting to
10. Honourable mentions
go to Daniel Boulby and
Wim Van Der Schoot
who both decided that
10 laps were not enough
and did 11 instead. The
race for the win came
down to a sprint finish,
with Romain coming a
commendable 2nd place
by only a second. 6 of
the top 15 were Imperial
athletes, with 5th place
going to Luke Whiting,
6th to Matt Ryan, 8th to
Angus Phillips, 9th to
Mark Pollock and 15th
to Cedric Ormond. It was
also great to see so many
giving duathlons a go for
the first time, well done to
Alex Luisi, Daniel Boulby
and Shravan Nageswaren.
“3 out of the
top 4 female
duathletes
were Imperial”
“We chose to
do even more
exercise and
cycle back
home”
The girls arrived
significantly better
rested and dryer than the
boys for their 9am start.
Imperial had a strong
representation in the
women’s race with about
20% of the field. Spoiler
alert: 3 out of the top 4
were Imperial. Almost
sounds like an academic
league table. With Freya
Espir leading the run and
being first into transition,
hopes were high that
she would take the win.
Closely following in her
wake were Minty Martin
and Marion Artigaut. The
recovering Imperial men’s
team were playing their
role and providing enthu-
siastic support and live
intelligence to the women
as they went into the
bike. About 10 laps later
Freya was off the bike, I
say about 10 because she
actually did 11, yet still
came 3rd. Kudos. Minty
(who did do 10 laps)
came in for 2nd place and
Marion in 4th. Lois Baker,
Emma Claxton, Esme
Hotson Moore and Mari
Funabashi all had strong
races.
The organisers found
it very funny how STEM
students could not count
to 10, but we set our repu-
tation straight by assuring
them that UCL would
only do worse.
Flapjacks, cakes,
gossip and race stories
were then shared between
the victorious Imperial
team. Whilst we were
recovering a few of the
faster duathletes got to
stand on the podium and
claim their rewards from
the Hillingdon champagne
cupboard.
Following the women’s
race was ‘the main event’,
‘what we woke up for’
or ‘the cutest thing since
Charlie bit my finger’ –
the under 8’s duathlon.
This draft-legal, stabilis-
ers-illegal duathlon was
well worth staying for.
The Spiderman trisuits
and dinosaur helmets
were too much for some,
who decided there and
then to adopt.
As the weather had
decidedly improved, we
chose to do even more
exercise and cycle back
home. Back in Ham-
mersmith, we enjoyed a
compulsory microwave
meal (courtesy of The
William Morris). A couple
of soggy sausages and wa-
tered-down maple syrup
was just what the group of
damp duathletes needed.
After dabbling in daytime
drinking, we then realised
that we were at Imperial
and we had more work
than time, so we made our
ways back home to relish
in a hot shower.
Despite the inclement
weather, another suc-
cessful outing for 16 of
Imperial’s triathletes and
good preparation for next
weekend for the biggest
and best duathlon of the
year: BUCS Duathlon.
BUCS marks the end
of the duathlon season
for the year, but do not
despair as come the new
year we’ll be competing
in aquathons (swimming
and running) building
up to triathlons around
Spring.
