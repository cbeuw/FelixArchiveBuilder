Gang signs and a Prayer
I
n their tracksuit
hoodies and their
Adidas creps, their
mesh crop tops
and skinny black jeans,
their baseball caps and
performative, cocksure
swagger, the teenagers of
Erica Whyman’s Verona
would not look out place
in a Stormzy video. In
the new RSC production
of Romeo and Juliet,
Shakespeare’s Italian city
has been built in modern
day London’s image. We
don’t have to suspend
our disbelief too much;
this story of streets where
a misjudged remark is
answered by a flash of a
knife is sadly not all that
unfamiliar.
It’s not just the
wardrobe that Whyman
has updated, but the
narrative too. The pro-
gramme calls it “queering
the pitch”; in practice,
genders are a bit more
fluid, queer themes a little
more explicit . Benvolio’s
love for Romeo is more
overtly romantic than
historical adaptations
suggest, though even
here it is painfully silent,
burdened by layers of
repression and heteronor-
mativity. Charlotte Jose-
phine plays Mercutio as
a glittering loud-mouthed
seventeen-year old girl
constantly spoiling for
a fight. Josephine is
luminousintherole,filling
the stage with tremendous
energy and appropriately
mercurial physicality.
In first couple of acts
she is larger than life,
brimming with bravado
which quickly collapses
in her dying moments.
Josephine with poignancy
shows Mercutio for who
she really is – angry yes,
but also impossibly young
and scared.
The great strength of
Whyman’s adaptation is
its ability to strip back
the trappings of the Eliz-
abethan English to reveal
its principal characters
as the children they are,
only just blossoming into
adulthood. Here, Romeo
and Juliet, Benvolio and
Mercutio, are kids full
of their own importance,
kids sure of their im-
mortality, kids forced to
grow up too fast in brutal,
violent ways.
Senseless rage and
pointless acts of retribu-
tion, not star-crossed love
are at the heart of this
production. The menacing
glint of sharp blades is
ever-present. The stage
has been constructed by
designer Tom Piper as a
brutalist concrete mauso-
leum, cold and vast. In the
world of these teenagers,
the pretty things – the
strings of twinkling lights
that descend in place of
stars during the balcony
scenes, or the huge lush
wall of ferns that acts as
a backdrop for the Friar’s
home – are fragile, acutely
transient.
The smash bang of the
electronica-inspired score
punctuates this punchy
adaptation, but for all
its modern flourishes,
the adaptation is still
classically good. The
passages that will for
many in the audience be
familiar, never feel trite.
The hugely charismatic
Barry Gill is excellent as
Romeo, capturing both a
rogueish impulsivity and
flashes of loving sensi-
tivity in his performance.
Karen Fishwick as Juliet
is equally good. The
young actors are ably sup-
ported by a talented roster
of castmates playing the
older roles, with Ishia
Bennison as Nurse and
Andrew French as the
Friar standing out as
scene-stealing performers.
There is diversity of
gender, skin-tone, expe-
rience and accent in the
big speaking roles and
while this is commend-
able, what is even better
is that none of this is
superfluous. Whyman’s
production without pre-
tension or fanfare illumi-
nates this play of passion
and violence for our age.
The result is a wonderful
production but one that is
rather more classical than
it would first appear.
Walk Swiftly and With Purpose: a debut to remember
T
hree Sis-
ters’ produc-
tion company,
brainchild of
Siofra, Grainne, and
Cara Dromgoole, imme-
diately throws us into
the world of a group of
schoolgirls on the cusp
of adulthood. Eve, Lana,
Robbie, and Misha,
despite the deep and
powerful themes they
explore together, ulti-
mately represent the un-
flinching devotion and
love between friends,
all the way through the
chaotic teenage years
that resonate with us all.
They’re hilariously re-
latable, albeit a bit pre-
tentious, living sheltered
lives in the comfort of an
all-girls private school.
We meet them at the
exact moment they sud-
denly encounter real-life
problems and have to
learn to deal with them.
No longer existing in
their fantasies of what
adulthood is, they real-
ise it may not be all it’s
cracked up to be.
When I read that this
is Siofra Dromgoole’s
first live play as a writer,
I was surprised. Her inex-
perience is unnoticeable,
with a script that artfully
combines witty repartee
between the girls with
serious and, at times,
deeply unsettling scenes
between Mr Hughes
and Misha – teacher and
student, as well as sudden
intense monologues
directed towards the
audience by each charac-
ter. This rapid switching
betweennaturallyflowing,
light-hearted conversation
and emotional, vulnerable
soliloquys to the audience
is a bold choice – done
poorly it has the poten-
tial to derail the entire
play – but somehow the
transitions are effortless,
in spite of the abrupt
changes of tone, most
likely thanks to the ex-
cellent direction of Imy
Wyatt Corner. It elevates
the play from simply
being four somewhat priv-
ileged girls talking about
typical teenage troubles,
to something much more
thought-provoking.
The extraordinary
potential of the all-female
crew behind this produc-
tion is unprecedented;
the way I see it, the sky is
the limit considering the
resounding success of this
play. I only wish it were
longer than 50 minutes
– with exceptional perfor-
mances from rising stars
with great chemistry, I
could have easily contin-
ued watching the lives of
these characters unfold
for another hour.
Unfortunately, by
the time of this article
publishing, the show will
no longer be showing,
but keep a watchful eye
out for the next Three
Sisters production – I can
assure you it is not to be
missed! Now, I only wish
I could Walk Swiftly and
With Purpose back to the
theatre to see this show
one more time.

Pinter Three: Love and longing
O
ne way of look-
ing at speech
is to say that
it is a constant
stratagem to cover na-
kedness.” This statement
by Harold Pinter sums
up excellently the motif
that is characteristic of his
work, and which makes
his plays so powerful. In
them, what is said is but
a flimsy covering for the
things that remain unsaid,
revealing despite itself
the raw nakedness of
human emotion beneath.
In Pinter Three, a collec-
tion of eleven of Pinter’s
short plays touching on
memory and loneliness,
the “poverty within us” is
picked out with brilliant
clarity. Not explicitly, but
obliquely – like the stark
shadows cast by objects
when a bright light is
shone on them.
The evening opens to
a phenomenal start with
Landscape, a hard-hitting
play which packs an
emotional punch. Tamsin
Grieg shines here as Beth,
a woman lost in a romantic
reverie of the past, using
a lilting Irish accent that
adds to the wistful nos-
talgia of the play. Keith
Allen plays her foil as
Beth’s crude, down-to-
earth husband. Ostensibly
having a conversation, an
unbridgeable gulf yawns
between the two. Who
are they really talking to?
Each is utterly alone in
their own recollections,
and the darkness in the
story encroaches slowly,
before we know it.
Grieg and Allen in
Landscape bring out
Pinter’s masterful ability
to alternate between comic
and tragic. Something
will be funny, and all of a
sudden, without warning,
a character will let some-
thing slip, and we see that
it is actually intensely sad.
Another standout example
is the short sketch Girls,
with Tom Edden as a
professor relating a story
about “girls who want to
be spanked”. Likewise
with comedian Lee Evans’
brilliant rendition of
Monologue, which Evans
came out of retirement to
act in. Chatting animated-
ly to an empty chair, the
protagonist of Monologue
is trapped in old memories
and confabulations. But
with his jaunty demean-
our and spring-loaded
mannerisms, Evans brings
tears to our eyes – whether
from laughter or sadness
I’m not quite sure. We are
swung from frank hilarity
to aching sorrow in less
than a heartbeat.
A great deal of what
happens in a Pinter play
happens between the lines,
behind the scenes. What
we see is merely the tip
of the iceberg. Scratching
the surface of loneliness.
Whether it’s a man having
a conversation with an
absent friend, or a pro-
fessor inventing a fantasy
about a girl he’s seen once
on the street. And yet
there is tenderness to be
found there, too. In Night,
a man and a woman argue
about the details of their
first rendezvous – was
it against railings, or
on a bridge? Each has
their own version of that
magical first meeting,
but in the end, it doesn’t
matter. Evans and Meera
Syal bring this beautiful
little piece to life with
truly believable affection.
Huge props to Jamie
Lloyd for curating these
eleven plays. Despite
spanning almost fifty
years of Pinter’s work,
they flow smoothly in
this frankly astounding
production. Soutra Gil-
mour’s versatile revolving
set, illuminated by a
singular lightbulb, whirls
us seamlessly from one
scene to the next. With
this remarkable cast of
actors, we see the shades
of emotional subtlety in
each piece, how the nature
of memory is wholly
subjective. This is Pinter
at his finest.
Pinter Four: Not quite hitting the standard
I
f you had taken the
advice that ended
our five-star review
of Pinter Two three
weeks ago, you would
have rushed to buy tickets
to one of the shows in
this series. Pinter Three,
also reviewed in this
issue, lives up to this but
in Pinter Four we find
that not all scripts are
created equal and when
the balance of plot and
dialogue are misjudged,
both playing and directing
becomes a minefield.
The first of the two
plays, Moonlight, strug-
gles to find its tone. It is
fundamentally an explo-
ration of death and family.
Besides the haunting mon-
ologues from wide-eyed
and moonlight-cloaked
Bridget (Isis Hainsworth)
that begin and end the
play, the stage is centered
around the bed of Andy
(Robert Glenister) as he
lies dying. The curtains
remain half-open and the
boxed set, complete with
verbally-sparring married
couple Andy and Bel
(Brie Brennan), initially
feels like a slightly dated
multi camera sitcom. –
complete with various
family members and affil-
iates crossing through the
stage, all supposedly in
different places or times.
Therearesomestandout
moments. Janie Dee
delivers a number of fan-
tastic speeches as Maria,
ex-lover of both Andy and
Bel, fully embracing the
characteristic snappiness
of Pinter’s writings. Once
up and running, most
of the issues disappear.
Glenister is captivating
once Andy shifts from
nonchalance and anger
to crisis and collapse.
The two brothers, Jake
and Fred (Al Weaver and
Dwane Walcott), who
appear as cut-scenes, by
halfway are dealing out
lyrical and absurd dialog
in perfect Pinteresque
fashion. It’s just a shame
that it doesn’t begin so.
Night School, the
second play, shifts the
focus to the theme of
deception in everyday
life. Still filled with Pin-
terness, this play doesn’t
shine for its plot. Walter
(Al Weaver), fresh out of
prison, tries, exaggerating
his crimes, to seduce
Sally (Jessica Barden), a
PE teacher, supposedly
studying at night school
but in fact working at a
nightclub. Solto (Glen-
ister again), a stingy and
narcissistic ex-criminal,
who fakes being a poor
pensioner to evade taxes,
enters the competition for
Sally’s hand. Within this
bland frame Walter’s two
aunties uplift the mood
with their peanut-gallery
commentary, giving some
Pinteresque flavour to the
whole situation.
Fortunately the Jamie
Lloyd Company succeed-
ed in turning what could
have been a forgettable
experience, into an oppor-
tunity for experimentation
with minimalist staging.
Originally conceived
for television, its script
doesn’t describe much of
the setting. The director
Ed Stambollouian under-
takes this challenge with
some interesting and risky
stylistique decisions. On
stage is the bare bones of
what could be a room: a
gargantuan cubic frame
is at its centre, creating
various layers where the
action takes place. The
brilliant Abbie Finn,
alwayspresentintheback-
ground, plays on a drum
kit, beating the action,
and giving a hysteric twist
to the transitions between
the scenes. Jon Clark’s
lighting design is mag-
nificent, bringing into life
the actors’ actions, and
perfectly marrying the
drum’s rhythms. Stam-
bollouian successfully
amalgamates contempo-
rary and more traditional
theatre, bringing some
refreshing courage to the
West End.
Pinter Four is definitely
an enjoyable show. Maybe
not as life-changing as
others, but nonetheless
the Jamie Lloyd Company
doesn’t fail to confirm
itself as one of the most
curious experiences now
available on the market.
