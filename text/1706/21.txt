Life in the Dark: a momentary escape from the hustle
and bustle of London
E
nter a subterra-
nean pitch-black
cave, or even
the vast deep-sea
of the ocean in this new
Natural History Museum
exhibition, which
introduces us to the aston-
ishing lives of the elusive
animals that exist in these
seemingly uninhabitable
environments. Divided
into three main parts
entitled “Life at night”,
“Life in caves”, and “Life
in the deep”, we are met
with countless nocturnal
animals, cave-dwellers,
and deep-sea creatures.
Of the array of animals
covered in the exhibition,
ranging from small fuzzy
aye-ayes to live Mexican
blind cave fish, some
seem almost alien. The
fact that only 5% of the
world’s seas have been
encountered by humans
makes us wonder what
else could be lying below
in the depths of the ocean
– you’ll leave this exhibi-
tion believing anything is
possible after seeing what
already exists, such as the
preserved black seadevil
and dumbo octopus on
display.
In classic Natural
History Museum style, the
exhibition is extremely
family-friendly, and there
is a clear emphasis on the
interactive aspect, as we
encounter soundscapes,
scents, light installations,
and free-to-touch furry
taxidermy animals,
making it compelling and
accessible for children and
adults alike. Somehow an
ideal balance has been
struck between visual
stimulation and interactiv-
ity suitable for children,
yet enough written infor-
mation to allow adults to
engage as well.
There’s a wonderful
blend of modern interac-
tive displays with some of
the museum’s specimens
from their plentiful col-
lections. All your senses
are engaged, and the
dim, almost non-existent
lighting heightens all
your other senses and
removes you from the
bustling world outside
of the exhibition. The
first room hits you with a
cacophony of night-time
forest sounds, whilst the
final room immerses you
in a mesmerising simula-
tion of a bioluminescent
deep-sea environment,
with hundreds of oscillat-
ing lights on the ceiling.
And all that’s in between
is equally as engaging.
There’s a chance to see
yourself through the
eyes of a cave boa via
an infrared live camera
of the room, or smelling
stations where various
handheld devices emit
odours for you to guess,
including eucalyptus,
lemon, mango, wood sap,
as well as the less enticing
guano (bat excrement)
and worms.
Adults may find their
ticket prices a little
steep at £12.50, but with
children 16 and under
going in completely free,
I’d say it’s a decent deal
for a family. Concessions
at £8.50 may also find the
price on the expensive
side, but if you fancy
splurging a little and
treating yourself, this is a
great bet.
Courage Everywhere: And Others – Emotion-Packed
to The Core
O
ver the last
week, the
N a t i o n a l
Theatre has
marked the 100th anni-
versary of (some) women
in the UK getting the
right to vote through a
series of talks, rehearsed
readings and screenings
that reflect on suffrage
and the fight for equality.
And Others, aptly named
to represent the women
whose voices “have been
lost to history” despite
fighting for suffrage, was
a brilliant opener to such a
remarkable event.
As a non-British male,
going into the rehearsed
reading of this new play,
I first realised how little
I knew about the subject
matter, which did scare
me. Although, I thought
it was best to embrace
my lack of knowledge on
the subject matter, and
to learn from what I was
about to witness. And
learn, I did.
The reading, which was
directed and performed by
D/deaf (some prefer it to
be capitalised) and disa-
bled women, focused on
the D/deaf and disabled
women who fought for
suffrage 100 years ago
and the challenges these
women face now, was
immersive and touching.
t was clear from the first
moment how passionate
the cast was to be a part
of such a remarkable play.
Despite the very specific
subject matter, the reading
was inclusive throughout.
Being informed first hand
the amount of difficulties
these women face in their
day to day lives, such as
difficulties in voting and
getting jobs as serious ac-
tresses gave the reading an
extra emotional punch, as
now the play was not just
about women who lived
100 years ago, but women
who live now amongst us.
Perhapsthemostshock-
ing part of the reading was
how relevant it felt to the
current world. Particular-
ly, it was eye-opening to
find out about the chal-
lenges disabled people
still face in voting. In fact,
according to And Others,
17% of disabled people
were turned away at poll-
ing stations in 2014, a
number which astonished
me. This was due to une-
quipped polling stations,
and a lack of easy-read
voting ballots, amongst
other reasons.
Other current issues
that the women touched
upon included the gender
pay-gap, LGBT rights,
feminism, men’s roles in
feminism and the #MeToo
movement, with a not-
so-subtle reference to the
widely publicised sex-
ual assault accusations
towards the then-United
States Supreme Court
nominee Brett Kavanaugh
by Dr Christine Ford.
Arguably the most sig-
nificant running theme
throughout the reading
was the importance of
learning from our past
to avoid repeating some
mistakes in the future. In
times like these, it is of
utmost importance to ap-
preciate how far we’ve
come in the last 100 years
to establishing fair, equal
communities, although it
is at least as vital to know
how far there is to go.
As pointed out by an
audience member dur-
ing the Q&A following
the performance, history
is a narrative that we are
writing right now. So, in a
hundred years from now,
what do you want the his-
tory books to read?
