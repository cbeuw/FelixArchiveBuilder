ICXC regain Bannister
Cup in final LXCLof 2018
L
ast Wednesday,
14th November,
just two weeks
after Mitcham
Common’s sunny race,
London’s sturdy athletes
took out their spikes once
more to compete in this
term’s (and 2018’s) final
LUCA Cross-Country
League race, the much-an-
ticipated Wimbledon
Common.
With laps being longer
than average at 4.7km, the
women’s race consisted
of just one lap while the
men had to go around
the course twice. As the
hour grew near, the teams
gathered by the Windmill
Tea Rooms to prepare for
the start of the race.
As usual, the race
began with a stampede as
216 runners stormed off
at 15:15 in the afternoon
and made their way to the
woods.
The course is well-
known for its technical
terrain and has been
known to turn many
ankles over the years.
This year the days
preceding the race had
been suitably wet, making
the course even more
technical than it otherwise
would have been.
The wide start-line soon
narrowed to an early bot-
tleneck, where ICXCAC
star Niki managed to trip
newbie PhDaniel who
fell with a thud before
somehow making it back
to his feet without being
trampled.
The route then took the
runners along the path
for a long straight before
turning into mud. Several
undulations and puddles
later, the course led down-
wards before a long climb
back towards the start to
complete the lap.
Very quickly the
runners started to reach
the finish line as after
18:16, Imperial’s Katie
Olding came in first in the
women’s race, followed
very closely by a St Mary’s
athlete who spoiled an
Imperial clean-sweep
as Alex Mundell and
Georgia Curry came third
and fourth place in 18:25
and 18:39 respectively.
Chloe Baker rounded off
the team for Imperial,
with a stunning 9th on her
ICXCAC debut.
On the day, Imperial’s
A team came in first with
587 points, St Mary’s
A team came in a close
second with 581 points,
King’s A team in third
with 537 points and UCL’s
A team in fourth with 525
points.
This allowed Imperial’s
Women’s A to build on
their commanding lead in
the league, with the team
now on 1741 points – in-
creasing their lead by 62
points to 91 ahead of UCL
A’s 1650 with two races to
go next term.
In the men’s race, St
Mary’s athletes dominated
thefield,taking9ofthetop
12 places, but fortunately,
Imperial runners Niki
“Tripper” Faulkner and
debutant Dan “Tripped”
Mulryan broke the St
Mary’s perfect finish as
they placed fifth and third
respectively in 31:21 and
31:15.
It takes more than one
fall to keep Dan from the
medals!
On the day, SMU
placed 1st and 2nd with
their A and B teams, with
Imperial Men’s A coming
in third – their best finish
in the league this season –
gaining 36 points on UCL.
Overall, Imperial
Men’s A remain in 4th,
some 75 points adrift of St
Mary’s in 3rd and a com-
manding 131 point ahead
of Reading in 5th.
Wimbledon Common
has always been host to
the annual University
of London XC Champi-
onships and Bannister
Cup – two championships
with a separate scoring
system from the overall
league. Imperial are inel-
igible for the UL Champs
since voting for “Ixit” by
leaving the University of
London in 2006.
Imperial remained
eligible for the Bannister
Cup, however, named
after late-famous for-
mer-student of St Mary’s
Hospital which was
incorporated into ICSM
in 1997. The Cup sees the
scores of the first three
men and two women who
study medicine, biomed-
ical science, or any other
vaguely medical field
forming a team.
With former-captain
Alex Mundell rallying the
medic troops, Imperial
managed to regain the
trophy from Barts who
reluctantly handed
Cross Country’s medics shine to ensure it’s coming
home!

“For some
reason the
scores are
inverted in the
Bannister Cup”
over the trophy for the
medal ceremony before
hastily requesting it back
as it “belongs in their
museum”.
The so-called “ICSM
A” team topped the table
with just 22 points with
Barts on 28 (for some
reason the scores are
inverted in the Bannister
Cup).
Meanwhile in the
Mike Baggs Trophy,
which scores points to
both men’s and women’s
teams, Imperial remain
top with a narrow 2-point
lead over St Mary’s,
who themselves are just
1-point ahead of UCL.
It really is all to play
for with 2 races left in the
league!
In the individual
standings, the women’s
podium saw a reshuffling
as Imperial’s Kate Olding
overtook teammate
Georgia Curry, inverting
the order of the Imperial
duo atop the leaderboard
with 446 and 445 points
respectively.
TheLondonXCLeague
continues in January, with
the final two races taking
place at Alexandra Palace
and Wormwood Scrubs.
