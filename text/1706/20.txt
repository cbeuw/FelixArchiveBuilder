I am Ashurbanipal, king of the world, king of Assyria
T
o many, the name
Ashurbanipal,
will sound un-
familiar or may
bring back distant mem-
ories of history classes.
Assyria, one of the great-
est kingdoms in the world,
was at its peak in 631BC,
with lands extending from
the modern day Cyprus to
Iraq and Egypt. This ex-
pansion was only possible
under the competent reign
of Ashurbanipal, youngest
son of Esarhaddon.
So how can a man
reign over such a massive
empire? Compared to his
predecessors, Ashurbani-
pal was more than just a
ruthless ruler - although
he certainly was that,
fearlessly impaling lions
and slaying his enemies,
be they a neighbouring
rebellious king or his
own older brother. The
King of the Neo-Assyrian
Empire was renowned
for his mind, of which he
was proud, as you will
notice on the stonework
displayed at the exhibi-
tion, where Ashurbanipal
is presented with a spear
in his hand and - more
significantly - a stylus
behind his belt.
Ashurbanipal’s passion
for writing led him to es-
tablish The Royal Library,
located in the capital of
Assyria, Nineveh, holding
over 30,000 tablets con-
sisting of diverse texts
from legal documents
to literary compositions
including the Epic of
Gilgamesh.Avast number
of these tablets are present
at the exhibition due to an
unfortunate (or fortunate)
occurrence. During the
fall of Nineveh, an event
recorded in Greek history
and described in the Bible,
many of these tablets were
baked in the great fire that
burned down the city, thus
preserving them to this
day.
In this exhibition, the
British Museum presents
the life of Ashurbanipal
through over 250 exhibits
from museums all around
the world. From stone
carvings to jewels, statues,
and tablets, some of which
have not been shown to
the public eye in the past
15 years. The exhibition
takes you slowly through
the history of Assyria
before, during and after
the reign of its greatest
King, Ashurbanipal.
has cleverly placed
projectors to light up bits
and pieces of the artefact,
with accompanying sound
effects, while projecting
a description of the events
in the carving nearby,
creating a cohesive story.
I am Ashurbanipal:
king of the world, king of
Assyria is more than just
an exhibition portraying
some long forgotten
history. At the end of the
exhibition you will also be
presented with a surprise:
a video message from the
women who are partaking
in the Iraq Emergency
Heritage Management
Training Scheme.
Most of the exhibits have
come from Nineveh, Iraq,
a historical site that has
seen appalling destruction
at the hand of the Islamic
State in 2015. Currently
the British museum team
with the Iraqi Board of
Antiquities and Heritage
are rescuing the archaeo-
logical treasures from the
affected sites.
Splendour and might,
this exhibition presents
the peak of a civilisation
the history of which
remains unknown to
many. Be ready to trans-
port yourself more than
2,000 in the past as the
King has left many stories
behind worthy to be
passed down in time, so
come and listen to them
passing through the ex-
hibition which resembles
a well written narrative
with picturesque and
captivating artefacts.
The British Museum presents a narrative of the life of Ashurbanipal, a ruthless ruler with a passion for writing.
