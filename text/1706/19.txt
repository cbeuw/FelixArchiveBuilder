Simon Boccanegra And Then There Were
None like it

T
his season’s
first perfor-
mance of Simon
Boccanegra was
dedicated to the memory
of Montserrat Caballé, the
famous opera singer in the
bel canto tradition. If the
melodic, legato lines of
Verdi’s arias are a mean-
ingful tribute to this diva’s
style of singing, none of
the cast could quite com-
pare to her world-famous
quality.
The opera is structured
in a prologue and three
acts and tells the story of
a Genoese corsair who
is elected Doge by the
people. After twenty-five
years, his long-lost illegit-
imate daughter is found,
adopted by her unsus-
pecting actual granddad,
and falls in love with the
son of his greatest enemy.
Nobleman and plebeians
weave their way through
the convoluted political
scene of the city, rebel,
envy, commit treachery
and reconcile, up to a
tragic finale. Care was
taken to show the passing
of time: singers returned
from the ‘twenty-five
years later’ interlude with
visibly whiter hair.
For those who do not
speak Italian, subtitles are
provided. Still, it is hard to
follow the action at times,
particularly in duets or
trios, as captions do not
clearly mark the transition
from one character’s line
to another’s. And one
can’t suppress the feeling
of some details being lost
in translation, as often
long lines are translated to
only a few English words.
Gabriele Adorno earned
the audience applause
with his solo aria, and
Ferruccio Furlanetto as
Jacopo Fiesto impressed
with his consistently solid
performance, always
sounding clearly and
louder than the orchestra.
The anonymous and
often forgotten cast also
deserves praise: every
chorus moment brought
life to the stage, bursts of
action contrasting with
operatic, frozen-in-time
sections. Their off-stage
lines had a dark, ghostly
feeling that overall con-
tributed to the intensity of
the drama. Musically, the
orchestra was beautiful
and precise, support-
ing the scene without
becoming the protagonist.
In terms of collective per-
formance, the full section
in the council chambers is
unforgettable, involving
spectacular sword fights,
incredible coordination,
alternating arias, en-
sembles and choruses,
in an exciting crescendo
of dramatic tension and
exhilarating music.
W
hat if I
asked you
what the
most pop-
ular book ever written
was? Off the top of your
head. Think fast. Now
you can feel smug if you
thought the Bible, and
even smugger if you got
Shakespeare in second but
what about third? Now
we can quibble about
figures but why don’t you
take my word for it or, if
you saw the same Reddit
post, Reddit’s word for it.
Published in November
1939, And Then There
Were None is the story
of a group of people who
are lured to an island by
an unknown host and are
killed off one by one. You
may have heard of it; it is
the sort of book that you
have heard about, perhaps
due to its unfortunate,
now unprintable, original
name, or read parodies of.
That is its legacy.
What makes the book
so special is the way that
it subverts tropes and
genre harder than a WOC
parliament. Most murder
mysteries can be expected
to have quota of one
murderer with a potential
feeble assistant and a
superfluity of oh-so-inno-
cent and going on virtuous
souls all dedicated to the
task of rooting out the one
bad egg who is shown up
at the end.
The Scooby-Doo
reveal, while endlessly
entertaining, has a long
history, though it was
previously associated
with the church halls or
market squares of Middle
England rather than a
haunted fairground. And
Then There Were None
throws this formula out
of the window by making
every one of the charac-
ters murderers.
The idea, so ridiculous
as to literally deserve
ridicule, is made to work
by Christie by cutting
the whole plot off from
the rest of the world on
an island which gives the
whole experience a claus-
trophobic and dream like
quality. Fact and fiction
blur together as everyone
suspects everyone else
of being the ‘actual’
murderer and people go
just a lot mad. Again.
Sound familiar or clichéd?
That is because it is, now.
How many films, books,
plays, video games feature
this device of a group of
people trapped together
and then people start
dying? Maybe the words
‘the black guy dies first’
will jog your memory?
And it all started here.
Christie didn’t even stop
there; her original plan
was for the reader never
to find out who killed
the ten people on Soldier
Island. Unfortunately, this
was thought to be a bit too
radical for the time, and
probably still is nowadays
to be honest.
Next week, Dramsoc
will be putting on a per-
formance of And Then
There Were None, directed
by Ansh Bhatnagar and
Olivia Revans. “We hope
to live up to the legacy
of the book and give our
audience both a night to
remember and a satisfying
conclusion to the mystery
on Soldier Island. We
would love you to come.
The play will be running
from Wednesday to
Saturday, tickets, on the
Union website or on the
door, are only 7 pounds
for IC students and we
should be finished just in
time for Sports night. We,
the cast, hope to see you
there!”

most popular whodunit ever.

Where? Royal Opera House
When? Until 10 December
How Much? Tickets nearly
sold out
The stage at the Royal Opera House morphed into the
streets and rich saloons of 14th century Genoa, for an
evening of political games, action-packed scenes and
high-quality music.

The sets are enormous,
with the same columns
and tiled floor as a
common element for
every scene. Simple
details were added from
scene to scene: the Doge’s
personal belongings, a
palace’s front door, some
scribbled Italian graffiti,
or a lone bench in a colon-
nade. During the first act,
a particularly empty stage
proved too hard to fill for a
lonely Hrachuhi Bassenz,
singing Amelia Grimaldi.
With the entrance of
Carlos Álvarez, as
Simon Boccanegra, the
set regained energy and
interest.
There are of course
some brilliant moments.
