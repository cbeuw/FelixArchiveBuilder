T
he wind scratches
your face, your
mouth as dry as
parchment, the
bitter cold tormenting
your every thought. Your
bones moan in pain as you
search frantically for shel-
ter.under a tree, behind a
dustbin, in a cardboard
box, anything that will
get you through the night.
This is just a simplified
snapshot of the life of
a homeless person. As
Imperial students, we are
blessed to not be in this
position, but how often
does it occur to us that
this life could very easily
be ours?
As we enjoy the pleas-
ures of this world and sit
in out cushioned lives, we
often don’t think twice
about the people who are
suffering on our streets:
the homeless man who
we rush past on our way
into the tube station, the
woman whom we don’t
looktwiceataswepopinto
the corner shop because
we are “so hungry” or the
child sitting next to the
bin in hopes that someone
will drop in a half-eaten
sandwich. These are the
people who need our help,
the people who out of
no fault of their own are
living a reality that they
can’t escape. Yes, our time
is spent worrying about
how many lectures we
have to catch up on and
exams and lab reports, but
can we just give a fraction
of this time to think about
them. Just a small percent-
age of your time to think
about what we can do to
help those who can’t help
themselves. Don’t get me
wrong, I get it. We don’t
always know how to help
and honestly as students,
we don’t always have the
finances to either. But the
vision that I am proposing
here is bigger than that. It
is where we as students
volunteer our time to
the homeless and give
them a small part of their
humanity back.
The Imperial Muslim
Volunteer Network
(IMVN) has a vision to
increase student partici-
pation in volunteering for
the local community and
on campus. To help with
the issue of homelessness,
we are running fortnightly
Homeless Drives, giving
you the chance to give
food and drink to the
homeless. In the run up
to this, we are holding
our Homeless Panel on
Tuesday 27th November
in Huxley 340 at 6:15.
This event is open to all
and aims to explore the
issue of homelessness
and offer solutions to the
growing epidemic on our
streets. To find out more
information on our in-
spiring panellists, search
IMVN on Facebook and
click going on the event
page.
We really do hope to
see you there because
individually we may
not be able to cure the
problem of homelessness,
but TOGETHER it is our
duty to chip away at this
epidemic for as long as we
need to.
Legitimate violence?
Comment editor Charles Titmuss makes the argument that by failing to stand up to violence,
you only serve to legitimise it.
Violence, or the threat
of violence has been one
of the governing factors of
human interaction for as
long as humans have been
in existence, from the
earliest social groups right
through to the foundation
of the modern state. In the
COMMENT

Comment Editor
modern day, violence and
the threat of violence are
the fundamental under-
pinnings of state admin-
istration, in ensuring that
taxes are paid and laws
are obeyed. Many people,
mostly from a libertarian
or anarchist perspective
question the legitimacy of
this violence, based on the
idea that it has no moral
legitimacy. I would not
disagree with them, in that
violence is fundamentally
immoral, however, given
that it is so crucial to the
underpinning of human
society, the application
of the threat of and actual
violence must have some
practical legitimacy. This
short opinion piece aims
to define this practical
legitimacy.
I would argue that
the practical legitimacy
of violence is whatever
the perpetrator of that
violence is not brought to
account for. This varies
based on the society in
which the violence is
committed, for example,
in Russia and some
Middle Eastern states, it is
permissible to beat one’s
spouse and in the West it is
highly unlikely that drone
operators will be brought
to account for the violence
they conduct. Practically,
their violence remains
unpunished and therefore,
by allowing the status quo
to stand, that grants their
actions legitimacy. This
can similarly be applied
to those that take part
in illegal civil disorder.
As long as they remain
unpunished their actions
would be legitimate.
The implication of the
practical legitimacy of
violence is that it demon-
strates the need to have
the capacity to respond
to violence acted against
oneself or the state that
one occupies in order to
deny the violence legit-
imacy. It means that we
must come face to face
with the idea that “might
is right,” is the way that
the world has been run
and will continue to be
run for the foreseeable
future. Anyone that does
not believe that is living
in a fantasy. If you ever
wish to live in a world
where that is not the case,
then you will have to be
prepared to fight for it.
