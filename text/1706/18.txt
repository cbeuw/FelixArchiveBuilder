A Small Place and a Big
Message
Super Duper Close Up
O
nce you enter
the Gate
Theatre, you
are brought into
a room lined with rows of
chairs and scattered with
seemingly out-of-place
objects. Looking around,
you see that there is no
stage and you realise that
the ‘show’ you believed
you were coming to see
is far closer to a private
meeting. With no an-
nouncement, lights dim,
music blares and the
performance begins.
A Small Place is an
involved two-person nar-
rative of the 1988 essay
of Jamaica Kincaid. The
piece focuses on corrup-
tion, slavery and general
human filth and through-
out, the audience is made
to feel responsible for it
all. This confrontational
performance is given by
our narrators, Cherrelle
Skeete and Nicola Alexis,
who take turns to tell of
the shame of tourism and
the gross English occu-
pancy ofAntigua. Skeete’s
character appears to be
the calmer of the two and
although she acknowledg-
es the horror of what is
happening in Antigua, she
is also in a state of denial
and cautious positivity
when the piece begins. It
is Alexis, with her calcu-
lated and hard reason, who
eventually works the pair
into a rage and shows the
audience the true hatred
boiling in the hearts of
these two women.
The intensity and
intimacy of this work is
incredible and stifling.
The clever use of light
and the discomforting
use of static and noise
surrounds the audience.
Better still are the narra-
tors themselves who truly
carry the performance. In
both Skeete and Alexis,
there is an urgency and
raw emotion in face and
voice. The pair directly
entreat the audience and
under their gaze, we are
left feeling quite naked,
particularly when Skeete
is brought to the verge
of tears speaking of the
wrongs of slavery. It
truly is an emotional and
powerful experience.
As stated though, it is
the actors that drive this
piece and there were what
I felt to be unnecessary
and distracting additions
to the work. The room
is littered with mundane
items; a projector is used
to focus the audience on a
particular image or to en-
courage us to imagine our
own, books are used to
represent knowledge and
stress the importance of
the old Antiguan library.
But these small props are
where it should have been
left. There was a screen
in one corner of the room
placed on a bookshelf. At
seemingly random points,
the screen would turn on
and show some image
or film without audio.
Most confusing was the
inclusion of a scene from
the classic Disney film,
Beauty and the Beast. This
clip was later distorted
and played at an increased
speed and in negative;
perhaps it was actually a
very brilliant reference,
but it was definitely lost on
me. The actors also quite
literally weaved through
the audience, handing
members a string of red
wool as they went. This
appeared to be a means
of representing the slave
trade and the red blood
linking us all. However,
I found that I was more
conscious of not tripping
up one of the narrators
than actually listening to
what they had to say.
Putting this aside, A
Small Place had some
genuinely inspiring
moments and its dark
humour was an important,
if not painful, reminder of
our beastly history. The
wonderful description of
Antigua’s beauty and the
terrible account of tragedy
will certainly stay with me
for a long time.
O
ne moment
screaming pas-
sionately, the
next sitting in
the audience eating pop-
corn, Jessica Latowicki’s
creative performance will
feel like all of your anxi-
eties embodied in front of
you. Throw in a camera,
some French skincare
and a backdrop of a dark
forest and you have Super
Duper Close Up.
Covered in glittery
props and drowned in the
tunes of bubblegum pop a
la Robyn, it is a one-wom-
an play written and
performed by Latowicki.
Despite the glitzy set up,
her 80 minute monologue
is everything but sparkly
and upbeat. She manages
to perform the anxiety of a
millennial career woman
all in the span of one story,
which she sidetracks from
and returns to throughout
the play. You could say it
is a ramble, or a rant of
sorts, but a fun one indeed.
Latowicki’s nihilistic
comments will have the
audience laughing from
minute to minute, things
like “I read the news at
night just so that I can
justify my nightmares and
insomnia”. Through this
pessimistic ramble, we get
a glimpse into a very real
person, and much of it is
very relatable for a young
adult in today’s capital-
istic reality. Latowicki is
dressed in a shiny, green
dress and is standing in
the middle of the stage
very determinedly. She
has this angry Piper
Chapman (Orange Is The
New Black) energy about
her. The whole setting
is eerie (think Stanley
Kubrick’s two girls in The
Shining).
Apart from a maybe
unnecessarily dragged out
dance scene towards the
end, the whole play fits
together seamlessly with
all its agendas and media.
The experimental integra-
tion of technology is bril-
liant. Latowicki criticises
our use of technology
today, our ‘scrolling and
scrolling’ through social
medias, at the same time
as the play builds on the
use of it. Large parts of
the play are livestreamed
on a screen as they are
simultaneously taking
place right in front of you.
Sometimes you are unsure
which one you should be
looking at (I mean this
in the best way possible),
if you might miss some-
thing by just looking at
the screen. The camera
becomes a narrative in
itself, choosing to zoom
in very close, showing
only selected parts of a
particular scene. A lot
of the play is centered
around this topic, about
spending your life looking
at screens, jiggling too
many open tabs, ordering
too many things online
and posting too many
things on your instagram
for everyone to see.
Latowicki is easy to
listen to, but can still make
you feel uncomfortable
with scenes of her panting
and screaming, or even
dancing in a very sexual
manner, with the camera
very close up to her. She is
relatable but intimidating,
satirical and scary. At the
end of the show you feel
like you almost know
her as well as you know
yourself.
Super Duper Close Up
keeps you captivated from
the beginning all the way
through till the end. The
mix of media in this play
works together nicely.
Latowicki is a storyteller
who can really milk a
concept for all it’s worth.
When the lights dim down
at the end and everyone
starts clapping, you’ll
think it’s much too early
for it to already be over,
but also realise you just
spent 80 minutes listening
to one single dragged out
story and a lot of millen-
nial anxiety. If you want
to spend a very intimate
evening being entertained
by various anecdotes
depicted in experimental
ways, definitely go over to
Hackney Wick for Made
In China’s Super Duper
Close Up, you won’t
regret it!
