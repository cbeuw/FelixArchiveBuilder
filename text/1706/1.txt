Augar review: what does the future hold for
tuition fees?
Suggestions include
lower fees and shorter
courses.

T
uition fees
could be cut
to £6,500 per
year as part of
the latest government
review into higher edu-
cation. The government
is also urging shorter
degrees to keep overall
costs down.
The year-long Augar
review will examine
whether or not the current
funding situation provides
good value for money for
students and taxpayers.
The panel, chaired by
PhilipAugar,hasalsobeen
charged with looking at
the accessibility of further
and higher education,
incentivising competition
across the sector, and how
to provide students with
“the skills that we need as
a country”.
The universities min-
ister, Sam Gyimah, has
also called on universities
to provide two-year “fast-
track” degrees, which
could charge £11,150
per year. Overall, this
works out as £5,450
cheaper than a standard
three year degree, as
well as saving on a year
of accommodation and
living costs. However,
this plan would require a
vote in parliament to lift
the £9,250 fee cap. Lec-
turers are also reluctant to
provide classes during the
summer holidays, which
would be necessary to
avoid compromising on
quality and content. As
one university leader told
the Times: “In the summer
holidays academics write
their books. They do
not want to spend their
summer vacations teach-
ing undergraduates.”
Birkbeck, University
of London is focusing
on longer degrees, not
shorter ones. Following
"heartbreaking" increases
in students applying for
hardship funds, the uni-
versity intends to halve
tuition fees for its four-
year part-time courses.
The plan to reduce fees
from £7,000 to £3,500
is intended to increase
support for part-time
degrees,whicharepopular
among mature students
and those in work. The
master of Birkbeck, David
Latchman, believes the
government would be able
to subsidise the cuts at “no
– or minimal – additional
cost”.
As Felix has previously
reported, any move to
lower tuition fees would
predominantly benefit
wealthy students. Students
from poorer backgrounds
are less likely to pay off
the full amount of their
student loans than their
well-off peers. Lowering
tuition fees would not
– for most low-earning
graduates – make any dif-
ference to the total amount
repaid before the debt is
written off. For graduates
with salaries above the
current £25,000 repay-
ment threshold, however,
the amount they pay back
will reduce in line with
tuition fees (interest rate
changes notwithstanding).
An analysis by The Times
suggests that low-earning
graduates would save an
average of £1 each year.
