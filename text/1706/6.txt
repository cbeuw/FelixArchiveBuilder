Coffee? It’s in your genes!
Can’t crawl up to the lecture theatre before all that caffeine kicks in? Science writer Paula Rowinska explains why
exactly we fell in love with a drink that all our natural insticts should flag as poisonous.

itter equals
poisonous - at
least according
to our brain.
There seems to exist
only one exception from
this evolutionary dislike
for bitterness: coffee.
Why many of us cannot
even imagine a morning
without a cup of espresso
or latte, although its bitter
taste should make our
body issue a poison alert?
Researchers from the
Northwestern Medicine
and QIMR Berghofer
Medical Research Insti-
tute in Australia discov-
ered that, paradoxically,
genetic sensitivity to
bitter taste makes us even
more likely to drink larger
amounts of coffee.
“You’d expect that
people who are particu-
larly sensitive to the bitter
taste of caffeine would
drink less coffee,” argues
Dr. Marilyn Cornelis,
the assistant professor of
preventive medicine at
the Northwestern Univer-
sity Feinberg School of
Medicine in Chicago and
senior author of the study.
“The opposite results of
our study suggest coffee
consumers acquire a taste
or an ability to detect
caffeine due to the learned
positive reinforcement
(i.e. stimulation) elicited
by caffeine.”
This means that people
with high sensitivity to
bitterness of caffeine
form positive associations
with coffee - and enjoy
more cups a day than
their friends without this
genetic variant.
Researchers studied
genes and daily coffee
consumption of over
40,000 participants from
the UK. “Using the genes
related to our ability to
taste bitterness, we were
able to assess whether
those that have a higher
genetic predisposition
to tasting bitterness are
more likely to prefer tea
over coffee,” explained
Jue Sheng Ong, the lead
author of the paper, a PhD
student in the Department
of Genetics and Compu-
tational Biology at the
QIMR Berghofer Medical
Research Institute in
Brisbane.

people with genes respon-
sible for recognising the
bitterness of tonic water
or green vegetables, for
example Brussel sprouts,
tend to prefer tea over
coffee.
Interestingly, in com-
parison to people without
such gene variants, they
are also less likely to drink
alcohol, in particular red
wine. This result could
potentially help improv-
ing treatments for alcohol
addictions.
Ong admitted that they
did not consider milk,
cream, sugar or other
additions often put into
coffee cups. They focused
on the general links
between genes and coffee
consumption.
Taste remains one of
our most secretive senses,
but this study contributed
to its understanding. And
I will stop fighting my
coffee addiction - what
can I do, it’s in my genes!
