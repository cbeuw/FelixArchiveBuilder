At the second Union Council held last
Monday, a sentiment vote was passed
to create the new position of an Inter-
national Officer.
The paper was proposed by Hannah
Theodorou, Deputy President (Educa-
tion & Welfare), in order to account for
the large proportion of international
students at Imperial. Since 2001, the
percentage of international students at
Imperial had risen by 26% to 46% last
year. It was felt that these students ef-
fectively have no proper representation
in any committee within the Union,
although some members of council ar-
gued this. Certain members of Coun-
cil felt that the Overseas Committee
[OSC] gave adequate representation
for these students, however it was then
pointed out that they only cater for the
students who are part of the respec-
tive societies. It was also pointed out
that the OSC doesn’t necessarily look
after the welfare of the students, with
Social Clubs Committee [SCC] Chair
Peter Mabott pointing out that this
should surely be the role of the Deputy
President (Education & Welfare). Miss
Theodorou replied by simply saying “I
can’t be in 10 places at once”.
In the paper selected to Council, it
stated that the International Officer
shall be responsible for those issues
which specifically relate to interna-
tional students and organise relevant
educational and training events and
briefings, and report accordingly. They
would also sit on appropriate Union
Committees, as well as represent the
Union’s views on the relevant College
Committees. Other points included
jobs such as to facilitate an Interna-
tional Student’s Forum and support
International Students’ involvement in
all relevant areas of Union and College
activity.
The officer would also be responsible
to the Deputy President (Education &
Welfare) for the research and imple-
mentation of campaigns relating to
International Students, as well as carry
out such duties as may, from time to
time, be laid down by the Council or
the Executive Committee.
Some interesting points were also
raised as to the election of the position.
Since the officer would be representing
such a large proportion of the student
body, they would have to be elected by
a campus-wide ballot, however only
overseas students could vote. This
would mean that all the European Un-
ion students could not vote, yet what
was considered even more obscure
was the fact the person running for the
position wouldn’t have to be an inter-
national student themselves.
This was felt a bit strange since for all
the other faculty union positions, the
members running for the position had
to be from that relevant faculty, so as to
give the best representation. However,
it was felt by the Representation and
Welfare board that as long as the can-
didate had the best interests at heart
their representatives, then it wouldn’t
really matter. Others felt that this was
purely creating another seat for Hacks
or CV chasers on Council.
Hopefully the international student
body will be able to select the person
that best represents them and not an-
other person simply aiming to enhance
their CV.

Pregnant girlfriend
poisoned by Mary’s
consultant
Dina Ismali
News Correspondent
St Mary’s hospital has been hit by scan-
dal yet again, as it was revealed that
one of its consultants has been charged
with attempting to poison a pregnant
woman in a bid to cause her to miscar-
ry his child. The 43 year old consultant
involved worked at the hospital’s chest
and allergy department and is believed
to have been having an extramarital af-
fair with his victim.
Police say he put a potent concoc-
tion of the drugs Methotrexate and Di-
clofenac into her tea while at her home
on 2 February to induce an abortion.
Five days later he is alleged to have car-
ried out a second poisoning attempt
at his workplace. The doctor was ar-
rested a week later and charged at
Camberwell Green Magistrates’ Court
last month. A spokesman for Imperial
College Healthcare NHS Trust said the
consultant was excluded from working
at the trust in February 2008 when a
criminal investigation into allegations
made against him began. His case
has been transferred to Inner Lon-
don Crown Court for a plea hearing
in December, he faces three charges
of ‘attempting to unlawfully admin-
ister a poison or other noxious thing’.
Although he has been granted bail, he
has had to provide a sum of £10,000 to
support it, and surrender his passport.
His ex-lover, in the meantime, gave
birth to a healthy son one month ago.
Thecase,however,isnottheonlyem-
barrassment the Trust has had to deal
with in recent weeks. It follows revela-
tions that a team of St. Mary’s surgeons
mistakenly removed the wrong organ
from a woman who was booked in for
a gynaecological operation. Know one
has yet been disciplined or suspended
for the blunder.
To further add to St. Mary’s woes
this week its newly opened £1.4 million
birthing unit is under investigation af-
ter the deaths of two babies in under
three months.
