Things looked to be on the up for the
RSM last Wednesday when the team
fought back from 2-0 down to 2-2 but
a series of injuries and a lack of subs
left us open to concede a late third and
go down 3-2.
So when the 11 men turned up on
Saturday to face Goldsmiths on a wet
and windy afternoon, confidence was
far from flowing. The late running of
the opposition raised a few half jokes
about a walkover but it wasn’t to be.
The game started with a good spell
of pressure from the RSM and some
good defending containing Gold-
smiths attempts to break. The RSM
midfield dominated possession and
chances were created and it was left
winger Matt Bell who rounded his
man and got a great cross to the back
post where first year James Tolley
was on hand to nod home from close
range. The second was quick to follow
when the Goldsmiths goalkeeper, who
was struggling against the wind, failed
to clear from the edge of his box and
some quick thinking from Ben Bell on
the right saw the ball lob the keepers.
RSM were now controlling the play
with the back line making life difficult
for the goldsmiths forwards.
But RSM weren’t finished yet and an-
other good passage of play combining
the central and left midfielders ended
in a good near post finish to give Tolley
his second. At 3-0 there was a nervous
confidence starting to settle in with the
captain keeping the lines, and this was
further pressed 10 minutes from half
time when RSM old boy Nic English
was on hand to scream home a great
strike from outside the box.
The half time team talk was a warn-
ing of the wind and as expected Gold-
smiths started the second half brightly.
RSM then delivered the killer blow on
the break when on-loan midfielder Jon
M finished well after Goldsmiths failed
to clear their lines. With time ticking
down, a dejected Goldsmiths became
more and more frustrated at their in-
ability to break down the RSM defence,
and on the rare occasion when they

Goal (t)rout!
ICUAFC’s flagship team put 7 past Uni’s
Medway, a team mistakenly feared
got their chance, keeper Baker was
on hand to prevent any goals going in.
The late subs of the Puente De La Vega
brothers gave the team an injection of
energy for the last 15 minutes. As time
ran down the pressure was on but ex-
cept a last ditch tackle from Jon, RSM
never looked like slipping up.
The final whistle went to the sound
of cheers from the RSM players who
find themselves having taken 4 points
from 6 games against the top 6 in the
league. With the teams around us still
to play and being only 3 points off
fourth place this team has plenty of
time to turn the previous form into a
good run and move up the table.

IC Men’s 2nd XI	 3
Roehampton 2nd XI	 1
(A.E.T)
The 2nd XI travelled to Roehampton
last Wednesday to tackle their 2nd
team in an epic encounter in the first
round of the BUCS cup. Roehampton,
described as the ‘pits’, was always go-
ing to be a tough place to come away
from with a win but after a period of
extra time that threatened to be halt-
ed by darkness, the 2nd’s managed to
progress with a thrilling 3-1win.
We began the first half with a display
of champagne football. After an early
scare, in which a Roehampton winger
cut in from the left and flashed a shot
across goal which scraped the cross-
bar of keeper Dicko’s goal, we began
to dominate affairs. The energetic
central midfield pairing of Richie and
Gregor stamped their authority on the
game and patrolled the centre of the
pitch releasing the threatening wing-
ers Jon Hill and Tom Neisser while Jon
Card at right back also roamed up the
touchline threatening the opposition’s
defence. Fittingly it was a Card throw-
in which led to the opening goal as he
launched a Rory Delap-like missile into
the box which was headed out by Zeus,
the Roehampton centre back, only
for Richie to latch onto the dropping
ball, scoring with the sweetest of vol-
leys. This was precisely the catalyst IC
needed to push on. The forward pair-
ing of Damian and Sim began to ter-
rorise the Roehampton defence. Sim,
with his lightning pace, and Damian
with some intelligent running and neat
interplay with both Richie and Gregor
managed to create several unconverted
opportunities. As the referee blew the
whistle for half-time IC were leading
1-0 but were well aware that they could
well rue those wasted opportunities.
At the beginning of the second half
we seemed to be distracted with the
knowledge of those missed chances.
Roehampton seized the upper hand
in the game and momentum shifted in
their favour. Their direct style was dif-
ficult to cope with but the IC back four
remained strong with Scott Macken-
zie, Daniel Southcott, Card and Fern
all proving strong in the tackle and in
the air. IC always looked threatening
on the counter attack but Roehampton
continued to play a high pressure game
pumping the ball to their large centre
forward and playing long diagonal balls
which were tricky to cope with. The
bruising nature of the game took its
toll when Mitch was badly injured go-
The Miners battle hard against Goldsmiths to earn a deserved victory
ing over on his ankle. The defence was
re-jigged with Jon Hill taking over at
centre back but the ensuing confusion
led to an equaliser when a long through
ball found a Roehampton midfielder
in what looked to be an offside posi-
tion but he played on and coolly slot-
ted the ball into to the back of the net.
At 1-1 with 15 minutes left both sides
knew that another goal would almost
certainly guarantee progression to the
next round. The two IC substitutes on
the wings, Viktor and Romain, began
to use their fresh legs to good effect
stretching the Roehampton full backs,
Viktor even calling the goalkeeper into
actionwithastingingeffortfromatight
angle. However it was home side who
posed the greatest threat putting Dicko
under severe pressure, which was han-
dled effectively. His efforts in the final
10 minutes of normal time kept the
game square with several point blank
saves and some courageous handling
from the plethora of crosses and set
pieces that were thrown at him. A slice
of luck was also required to keep IC in
the tie as a Roehampton effort right at
the death cannoned of the crossbar.
A sense of relief accompanied the
whistle for the end of 90 minutes. The
referee announced a 14 minute pe-
riod of extra time much to the aston-
ishment of both sets of players but it
was Imperial who started extra time
with the greater sense of urgency and
immediately set about putting the op-
position under the cosh. The pressure
soon turned to a goal as Viktor made
an incisive break down the right and
fed a ball into Damian whose shot
ping-ponged about and finally fell to
Sim who tucked it away from no more
than 6 yards out. The onslaught from
Roehampton was inevitable but once
again they found Dicko in unbeatable
form. He made save after save and
shocked the Roehampton crowd with
his tigon-like reflexes. The home side
were deflated, a fact which showed it-
self as Gregor stole the ball from a Roe-
hampton full back and proceeded to
slam it home past the goalkeeper. The
final whistle sounded not long after as
the Imperial 2nd XI returned back to
the bus and S.Ken with a place in the
second round secured.

Imperial Men’s 1st XI	 7
Uni at Medway 1st XI	 1
The day pecan with the 1st XI (h)
erring on the side of caution on their
hen-counter with the Universities at
Medway. Said university are a gnu side
and thus had bee-n made to start from
league 7A, where the 3rd XI reside.
Girrafe-ter Medway beat them with a
resounding 11-1 victory, coupled with
the rumours that various members of
their squad had been recently released
from clubs as big as QPR and Charlton,
it would have been foal-ish if we mon-
key-ed around with this fixture.
Jokes aside, Captain Donovan deliv-
ered an empha-tick team talk that im-
plored us to take control (Troll isn’t an
animal) of the game whale-st still giving
Medway the respect they deserved.
After a shaky ini-seal 2 minutes
where lackadaisical attempts to clear
the ball forced a smart save from Mus-
tapher Botchway, the 1st XI woke up.
The defenders made a mare of the long
throw by Michael Donovan (or Mara-
dono or Donaldinho as he likes to be
called), which raced onto Leslie Eshun
who squared it to Irv Howson to stick
it in the back of the newt.
We relaxed at this point, knowing
that goals could come aplenty. Medway
showed their class, especially in the
middle of the pitch where the central
midfielder and the two wingers com-
bined well with some nifty back h-eels
and testing balls. Peter New, a fresher
to the club and university dealt with
these threats with ease and compo-
sure, much akin to the manner he has
fulfilled the role of centre half, previ-
ously held by last year’s 1st XI captain.
Will Swain won a corner and deliv-
ered a peach of a ball where Eshun rose
like a salmon and headed it in to make
it 2-0 with 20 minutes bear-ly played.
After an-otter good spell of posses-
sion, Samuel Rickards released a (f)
inch per-ferret through ball for Dion
Benincasa to latch on and coolly finish
to make it 3 goals to IC and jackal to
Medway at the halftime whistle.
During the break, 1st XI stalwart Ed
Martins reite-rat-ed that Medway were
not a bad side and that though we were
playing excellently, they were definitely
going to come back into the game. He
further advised that we may have to
swallow our pride and play cautiously
for the first 5-10 minutes.
2 minutes into the second half, Swan
turned provider again, knocking the
ball past the Medway defender, for Es-
hun to slip in and slot it past the goal-
keeper, to make it 4 goals in 5 games
for the cheetah like club fresher.
What punished Medway was their
wingers, though very comfortable with
the ball, were playing too deep in our
half and when we broke on the coun-
ter attack, we could utilise both the full
backs and wingers to produce goals.
This happened in unorthodox fash-
ion when on one of the breaks, Samule
was felled. Martins produced a cross
field ball from the free kick which
landed on a plate to the unmarked Do-
novan-Nistelrooy to head in.
Hopes of a clean sheet were dashed
after a speculative shot from the Med-
way midfielder was intercepted by Mc-
Mullen who then scored an own goal.
McMullen responded in true fash-
ion 5 minutes later by running half the
pitch, past 4 Medway players. Botch-
way’s shouts of ‘GOPHER IT’ we re-
sponded well, where the man-drill-ed
it to the bottom right corner.
‘Lanky’ Swain rounded off a perfect
day at Harlington with a clinical head-
er after a cross from de Figueiredo.

£25 tour! An amazing idea that origi-
nated from the Golden Era of ICHC
when Mary Williamson (Spanner)
ruled the nest of hockey legends. Fresh-
ers Tour was born has been an integral
part of the ICHC experience since.
Maria Parkes (Dominator) was in
charge and had recruited well with
equal amounts of freshers and oldies
attending the weekend. Allowing time
for masks and drinking on the Friday
night at the Ball, the club left at 10am
from the union. With banter galore
from the night before and awesome
tunes from MC Date.R. the journey
down to Brighton was more entertain-
ing than the time Jon Lander (Toad-
Fish) projectile vomited into a bin out-
side Belushi’s - it was then he lost his
100% record at the Christmas Dinner!
On arrival at the sea the team en-
joyed fish and chips as well as the joys
of loosing £5 in five minutes at the slot
machines. No matter, we played hock-
ey and met with El Presidente, Mark
Roberton (Tranny to some). Son Lu-
cas blessed us with his Jedi powers be-
fore we hit the town for food and drink
- very civilised. The night was danced
away in a club that had the class of a
first date in the Prince Regent followed
by a snog and a snuggle. Nice!
Sleep was very much needed for the
all important game on our way home.
In ICHC tradition we won scoring al-
most as many times as Dr. Harold had
last week. Senior members drank un-
til the late hours of the night back at
the union. Special mention to Prince
Charlie and her other half, but the win-
ner of the weekend must be Domina-
tor. What is your middle name?
