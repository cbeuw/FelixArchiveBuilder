The winner of Slitherlink 1,413 was
Jack Wilkinsonu ! Congratulations on
winning two puzzles. Ninja’s can’t even
catch you right now. Please keep enter-
ing. We’ll give a prize out in the sum-
mer. It’ll be good.
How to play:
Crudely speaking, Slitherlink is similar
to Minesweeper mixed with a dash of
Sudoku.
The object of the game is to draw
lines between the dots to create one
long, and most importantly, looping
line. It should have no start or finish;
just like an elastic band.
Each number indicates how many
lines should be drawn around it, for
example:
Cells which don’t contain a number
can be surrounded by any number of
lines.
Remember, the line must form a
loop, so the line cannot branch. The
following situations are not allowed:
Squares are not allowed either. There
are never cells containing the number
4 in Slitherlink.
So, where do you start? The most
common place to start on a Slitherlink
grid is by drawing crosses around any
zeros. Drawing crosses is purely done
to so that you know where there can’t
possibly be a line. So, take the pattern
below as an example. Begin by drawing
crosses, then by filling in some lines:
Now the lines can only continue in the
following directions:

Woah there, we were inundated
with answers last week, you lot
on roids or something? Anyway
the answer was DRYFLANGE,
well done to Jack Wilkinson of
Wilkinson Sword razor company
who got his reply in just too fast.
This week I wanted to start with a
joke:
. “Someone asks a millionaire how he
made his money
- Thanks to my wife
- ?!?!
- I was curious to see at what point
she’d stop complaining that we don’t
have enough money.”
After the shenanigans of ACC bar night
last week and several curry nights this
Wednesday, I have seen many a tired
face around campus. A very good way
to get rid of those eye bags is a cold
tea-bag. The caffeine helps somehow.
Actually drinking a strong cup of tea
helps too, of course.
Dear Tamara,
I like older women and they’re the only
ones I seem to be able to pull and even
then it’s only because they think I’m
from X-Factor. Help!
X-list celebrity
Dear X-list celebrity
They think you’re famous (well, Z-list)?
Excellent, I really can’t understand why
you’re complaining! I often find, main-
ly due to my excessive amount of fake
tan and bleach-blonde hair, that people
simply assume I’m famous! I don’t do
anything to correct this (letting them
make assumptions isn’t really lying!),
but take advantage of the fact that be-
ing ‘famous’ gives people even more
reason to talk to me and buy me drinks
to keep me sweet! I’ve even been known
to swing a few freebies and VIP areas
while out in the clubs of West London.
My advice is simply to neither confirm
nor deny that you are from X-Factor,
but to let them assume you are and
treat you accordingly. If you feel the
façade is slipping, I suggest topping
up your fake tan and really work the
boy-band look, so get those highlights
in and stick to pale jeans and a white
t-shirt and you’ll be sorted. Oooh, and
shades in a club always work a treat!
Dear Tamara,
I slept with a girl last week and her
brother a few days later. Should I tell
them or should I just shoot myself right
now?
Anon
Dear Anon,
You’re just greedy aren’t you?! Aside
from that just being very yucky, I’m
curious: who was better? Answers on
a postcard, please.
Dear Tamara,
My friends all think I’m gay but I’m not.
Why why why??
Novaj
Dear Novaj,
Perhaps if you stopped listening to
Abba in the office and no longer wore
sparkly thongs which show over the
top of your jeans they would have less
to base this assumption on? Also, only
kiss your male friends on one cheek
not both, don’t stroke their thighs
while giggling suggestively. Always re-
member, it’s not gay if
- Their arse is shaved
- You use scented candles
- Your balls don’t touch
- You don’t push back
- If you squint
Dear Tamara,
My boyfriend is a super genius and I
feel inferior in comparison. How do I
get over it?
Special in my own way
Dear Special in your own way,
You could knock him on the head…
Dear Tamara,
I have no sexual feelings and as a re-
sult, I’m terrified of getting into a rela-
tionship! Is there any hope for me?
Hopeless
Dear Hopeless,
Are you sure this is an actual psycho-
logical problems or is just that the tal-
ent at Imperial is somewhat uninspir-
ing? Try broadening your horizons to
other places in London and I’m sure
you’ll soon find people who hit all the
right buttons. However, if you do find
that noone you meet makes you wake
up middle of the night in wet sheets
then perhaps you need to think even
further afield. Animal, mineral, try it
all and see what you like. Your time at
university is, after all, supposed to be a
time of self-discovery.

IC Boat Club push world champion
Imperial College at Wingfield Sculls 2008
Olympian Mahe Drysdale edged vic-
tory in this year’s Wingfield Sculls hav-
ing been pushed hard over the 6.8km
tideway championship course by ICBC
scullers. This is an incredible endur-
ance test where racers all start together
regatta style, but have to maintain
power and technique over the entire
head race course. The eerie stillness
and crisp cold air felt along Putney
Embankment was reflective of the
mood in anticipation of this race for
the title of amateur sculling Champion
of the Thames and Great Britain. Dat-
ing back to 1830 this race is one of the
most physical and mental challenges a
sculler can face and only a select few
compete each year. ICBC, the home of
tideway rowing, accounted for three of
the five entries.
The final line-up was immense:
Mahe Drysdale of New Zealand rep-
resenting Tideway Scullers, a three
time World Champion just returned
from the Olympics. Drysdale’s steely
determination won him a bronze med-
al in Beijing despite suffering badly
from an infection throughout the race
and needing to be carried via a life raft
out of his boat.
Richard Ockendon of Molesey BC,
GB trialist and winner of the S1 4x- at
four’s head of the river race in 2005
with this year’s Olympic gold medallist
Andy Triggs Hodge.
3 of ICBC’s elite scullers: Simon His-
lop, Adam Freeman-Pask and George
Whittaker. Hislop and Whittaker were
winning crewmates in this year’s Visi-
tor’s Challenge Cup at Henley while
Hislop and Freeman-Pask were win-
ner’s of the Pair’s Head a few weeks
ago. Whittaker was also last year’s
sculler’s head of the river winner while
Freeman-Pask raced for GB at the Sen-
ior World Championships at Linz over
the summer. It was set-up to be an epic
showdown and did not disappoint.
Tension mounted with some brief
warm-up sprints from the competitors
and soon it was almost time for com-
bat. The 5 racers positioned themselves
in nervous anticipation of the start
call. Like lambs to the slaughter, there
Cristina Duffy was no helping them now. Without
delay attention was called and silence
fell across the river. Steering launches
awaited facing their racers. Blade to
blade and man to man, this is the stuff
of legends. The gentle ebb of the tide-
way bobbed the scullers as they came
forward to frontstops, hearts pound-
ing. Onlookers watched with bated
breath, fingers anxiously hovering over
camera shutter buttons. GO!
The peaceful serenity was shattered.
The five scullers blasted off unleashing
all the energy their last minute cereal
bars had provided. Engines roared as
launches took-off after the racers and
streams of v-shaped wash spread be-
hind. Thus began what would be over
20 minutes of intense wrestling against
each other, against the overwhelming
feeling of muscle ache and against the
most unpredictable of all: mother na-
ture. But Imperial was well prepared
for all these potential saboteurs and
took the early lead with Freeman-Pask
squeezing in front.
There was little between all five
competitors for the first 100 metres
but eventually Drysdale settled into a
steady rhythm and slipped into pole
position.
All racers took the inside line on the
Surrey side bar Ockendon who kept
wide for a good part of the course.
The Surrey four stuck close in the in-
tial stages causing much hand waving
from the steering launches attempt-
ing to prevent clashes between boats.
Through Hammersmith Bridge the
field had spread with Drysdale still
maintaining his lead but being chased
down by Freeman-Pask and Whittak-
er. A break in the clouds past Barnes
Bridge sent sharp sunlight down on the
sculler’s backs making racing lines dif-
ficult to determine against the glare.
In the closing stages Drysdale was
clinging to his lead as Whittaker
strengthened for the finish gaining wa-
ter on each stroke as they approached
Chiswick Bridge. With the gruelling
race nearly at an end the 5 racers emp-
tied what was left in the tanks and gal-
lantly sprinted for home. The finish-
ing order remained the order that was
held throughout the majority of the
Drysdale is pushed by 3 ICBC scullers
race with Drysdale winning in 21:14,
Whittaker second in 21:22 and Free-
man-Pask third in 21:34. With the line
crossed there was little celebration as
pure exhaustion consumed the racers
who gave a terrific performance on the
day. This year’s GB Olympic bronze
medallist Elise Laverick made the pres-
entations to Drysdale, as well as to So-
phie Hosking (London RC) who won
the women’s race in 22:05.
Imperial’s performance is a testa-
ment to the commitment coaches Ste-
ve Trapmore and Stuart Whitelaw have
shown to the three scullers in prepa-
ration for the racing season. Whit-
taker’s performance was particularly
exceptional giving nothing to Drysdale
who had to fight hard to keep the lead
throughout.
ICBC will have crews participating in
the Four’s Head of the River Race next
Saturday 8th November over the same
course but beginning in Mortlake and
ending in Putney. This is a spectacu-
lar event with over 500 boats passing
over the course from 10:30am. All sup-
port is welcome with vantage points at
Hammersmith Bridge and Putney Em-
bankment recommended.
Finishing order: Mahe Drysdale
[Tideway Sculler’s] (21:14), George
Whittaker [ICBC] (21:22), Adam
Freeman-Pask [ICBC] (21:34), Richard
Ockendon [Molesley] (21:42), Simon
Hislop [ICBC] (21:52).

Stage 6, 25km unfortunately began
for me where stage 5 had finished
thanks mostly to lack of sleep due to
sleeping on sprung sports-hall floors
and too many 5am starts. It was, how-
ever, the team’s best race in the com-
petition; we finished 4th mixed pair,
26 seconds behind second place in the
mixed category, and came in before the
leading women’s team. Neil enjoyed the
mist because it wasn’t sunshine, and I
only got up the one continuous 1922m
climb relying on Neil’s encouragement
and my own mild hysteria. I suddenly
became a convert to sports massages
after this stage.
The team discovered on the morn-
ing of stage 7 that the marathon-length
and 2788m climb stage race that was
the planned route had been turned
into plan B because storms were ex-
pected in the afternoon. These storms
never appeared but the organisers
were justifiably taking no risks (since
the end of the TAR this year there has
been a mountain-running race in Ger-
many where a sudden blizzard caused
several deaths). The team was count-
ing the big climbs to go until the end
of stage 8 but still appreciating the fan-
tastic scenery the route went through
in the Sud-Tirol.
The 8th stage was 34km and 2120m
ascent through the Dolomites. After
two major climbs on scree, it included
5km of high-level running at 2400m
skirting around the Tre Cime before
the last descent into Sesto. Neil’s Achil-
les’ tendon pain made sure the last
stage was not easy going, but the team
placed 8th, coming in well over the re-
quired 5 minutes ahead of their clos-
est rivals in the overall ranking, which
gave them a final position of 7th.
