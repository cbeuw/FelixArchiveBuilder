Man eat 100% steak burger
Beefburger purist, James Copley, visits our local Byron for a “Proper Hamburger”
ing as the adjacent Burger King and
KFC were, I was on Gloucester Road
to attend the opening evening of By-
ron, the fifth branch of the upmarket
burger restaurant that caused Sunday
Times’ Giles Coren to proclaim “the
best burger I’ve ever had”.
Admittedly, having passed the Ken-
sington High Street branch many a
time on the bus since it opened a year
ago, I entered Byron with a host of
prejudices.
The gentrification of the humble
hamburger happened to be one of my
many minor personal hatreds, and By-
ron’s rather pretentious tagline, ‘Proper
Hamburgers’, coupled with that name,
did little to quell my left-wing vitriol.

Best: Quality, fuss-free burgers
Worst:If you’re a fan of multiple,
beef-shielding toppings, there
are none, mate.
Price: £6-8 for a beefburger sans
frites
A previous experience at the Trades
& Descriptions Act violating Gour-
met Burger Kitchen (the only word of
those three I accept is ‘Burger’ - exactly
how much ‘cooking’ goes on in their
‘kitchen’ is a moot point) had lead me
to believe that this new breed of mid-
dle-class junk food was little more than
McDonalds with lurid sauces and less
polystyrene.
However, it soon becomes appar-
ent that Byron is not another clone.
Where their contemporaries attempt
to disguise the burger they are serv-
ing with spicy relish and several litres
of mayonnaise, Byron focus on what
makes the burger – the beef.
The menu consists of just seven
burgers, and four of these options are
to appease odious minorities: vegetar-
ians, chickenophiles, dieters and chil-
dren. This leaves a very basic choice:
to have cheese, to have bacon or to go
au naturel.
Some fans of modern franchise cook-
ing may declare this a violation of their
right to choice, but fuck them. Just
out of respect for God’s creatures you
should want to taste the beast who had
its throat slit to make you fat. Mango
chutney doesn’t feel pain.
Moving on from such frivolity, I can
inform you that from the moment the
burger touches your lips, you know that
this is a product of quality. Once again,
the key to Byron is the simplicity and
the painstaking pursuit of perfection.
The beef, naturally Aberdeen Angus,
is sourced from farmers in Morayshire,
Scotland. It is served with basic salad
in the classic soft white bun, made by a
fourth-generation East End baker. In
what could well be a wry homage to a
L
ast week I mourned the
death of Basil, my pet basil
and the continued demise
of Tim the Mint. Tim has
always been of a sickly con-
stitution but, as is the norm for mint
plants, he got too greedy and started
growing roots beyond his capacity. He
has been moulting leaves for weeks
and he will not be with us much longer.
With Basil the Basil it was a sudden
death - no-one expected it. His leaves
were long and green with a full aroma,
but one frosty night last week he just
withered and died. Out of my 3 herbs
only Clive the Chive survives. The
hardy herb is withstanding all frosts
and even my scissor-happy hand as I
use him to season salads and fish left,
right and centre! Bless him, he’s even
flowered!
It’s Friday and we have come to the
end of Healthy Living Week at Impe-
rial College. I am writing this on Mon-
day so I hope it has not passed in a
whisper and that some of you got in-
volved in the free massages or come-
and-try-it sports. Particularly, I hope
you all managed to scrounge healthy
free food on Queen’s Lawn on Tuesday
or Thursday!
You will do a double take when you
read ‘low fat’ and ‘Korma’ in the same
sentence but somehow I have man-
aged the impossible in this week’s food
page. Instead of using a curry paste
which has been wallowing in oil all its
life the flavours are infused by boiling
a water-based paste. It’s all the rage,
daaaaarling. Please give it a go and let
me know what you think. For dessert
Natalia Jardon offers up a delish Lime
Cheesecake – it’s the easiest thing in
the world and very decadent too.
Also, a little off the ‘Healthy Living’
topic, James Copley reviews the new
branch of Byron on Gloucester Road.
Byron’s slogan is ‘Proper Hamburg-
ers’ which basically means they have
100% Aberdeen Angus steak in their
burgers: no hooves, eyes or poo. By-
ron pride themselves on being simple
with no fuss or frills. I don’t know what
your opinion is of the GBKs and Union
Hamburgers of this world but with all
the multiple wanky toppings you for-
get there’s a burger in your burger. The
new Gloucester Road branch of Byron
should keep the local North American
tourist population happy and I hope,
reader, you will also partake in the de-
lights of a proper hamburger.
If paying £6 for a quality burger is
not your bag, baby, why not make your
own? Mix together a pack of mince,
half a grated onion, one slice of bread
(grated to make crumbs), an egg and
plenty of salt and pepper. Shape the
mixture into patties , then grill or fry
for 5 minutes on each side. Serve the
burgers in buns with whatever else you
fancy.
As per usual, boys and girls, send in
your recipes, reviews and rants. I am
not one to threaten, but if you don’t
send them in I will mix you with egg,
breadcrumbs and onion then fry YOU
on 5 minutes each side. You have been
warned. Love from Rosie xx
rather more well-known burger chain,
a gherkin is placed on the side of the
plate, thus avoiding a restaurant full of
people awkwardly attempting to prize
it from the bun.
The thing that must to be questioned
about the restaurant is not the quality
of the food, but the value for money.
£6-8 may seem steep, considering sides
such as fries, chips or salads have to be
purchased separately.
For some reason, no doubt to do with
profit, this has become standard in
such establishments, yet who honestly
wants to sit down and eat a beefburger
with no additional carbohydrate-based
accompaniment?
However, when you consider the cost
of generic fast food in London today,
Byron’s prices do seem fairly reason-
able. Their direct competitors charge
slightly more and offer a vastly inferior
product.
In a city where every pub serves
food, and believes food to be a £10
breadcrumb-and-gristle burger hidden
beneath a pile of sweet potato chips
and drizzled with balsamic vinegar,
Byron surprises by offering something
altogether more honest.
All in all, this is a welcome new addi-
tion to the armoury of the hungry but
lazy, Imperial student.
Both cheaper and superior to Black
and Blue just down the road, but lack-
ing the cosy atmosphere of the previ-
ously reviewed Caffe Forum, Byron is
well worth a go. Just try and swallow
any qualms you may have about eating
in a burger joint named after a bisexual
romantic poet.
You don’t need to try and be macho:
you’re eating cow for God’s sake.
In honour of Healthy Living Week, this version of the artery-blocking popular dish is full of protein, low in
fat and really, really tasty! Don’t be put off by the list of ingredients: once you buy them, they last ages as
invaluable store cupboard ingredients. For example, bash cardamom pods up and infuse them with melted
chocolate and milk to make a luxurious hot chocolate. Serves 2
1 onion, chopped
2.25cm ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
2 garlic cloves
150mL chicken stock
2 chicken breasts, cubed
1 cinnamon stick
5 cardamom pods
Salt and pepper
Juice of 1 lemon
150g coconut milk powder (available in supermarkets. Find it near the regular coconut milk tins)
150mL natural yoghurt
Use a hand blender to mince up the onion, ginger, garlic and stock until it is all homogenised. This is your
‘curry paste’. Take a nice big pan and simmer the curry paste for 5 minutes. Add the chicken to the paste and
stir well making sure the meat is covered. Cook for 5 minutes, and then add the cinnamon, cardamom, sea-
soning, lemon juice and coconut milk powder. Stir continuously on a medium heat for 10 minutes then add
the yoghurt with 150mL water. Simmer the curry for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve with rice and any
other accompaniments you fancy. Ta daa!

200g/7oz ginger biscuits
50g/2oz butter, melted
500g/18oz mascarpone
150g/6oz icing sugar
5 to 7 limes finely grated zest
and juice
Crush the biscuits and mix into
the melted butter. Press this into
the base of an 18cm/7” spring
sided or loose bottomed cake
tin. Chill in the refrigerator for 30
minutes. Grate the limes to ob-
tain a fine zest.
Put the mascarpone, icing sugar,
lime zest and juice in a bowl and
beat well until a smooth texture
is obtained. Spread over the bis-
cuit base and chill for at least 30
minutes, taking it out only just
before you’re about to enjoy!
