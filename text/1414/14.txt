CGCU and RCSU joined forces on Friday 31st October for The Masquerade Ball
O
n Halloween night’s
joint CGCU & RCSU
ball, the Masquerade
theme was a winner. It
was an excellent choice
for a Halloween night ball. Both a
classy and simple theme, which ele-
gantly complimented the stylish frocks
and tuxedos on display.
The festivities kicked off at 6.30pm
with scientists dining upstairs and
engineers downstairs. The chocolate
torte and wine were firm favourites
with many. There was a curious lack of
after dinner speeches but ‘The Booma-
laka’ tradition remained strong.
Post-dinner entertainment kicked off
with a Jazz quartet providing a snappy
soundtrack to the students useless at-
temptsattheroulettewheel. Somekind
of prize for the chip leader would have
been nice, to make the casino more
than just a drunken misadventure.
DJs from the Music Tech society
played all night. Keeping to main-
stream cheese and dance hits, they
pleased the tastes of a varied crowd.
Somewhat controversially, posters
advertising Colin Murray’s DJ slot at
the Union were prominently displayed
throughout the Sherfield Building.
Many ball ticket holders took advan-
tage of free entry to the union. Colin’s
well attended set of indie dancefloor
classics went down a storm.
My only qualm was the decor. Maybe
it’s just me but I felt more could have
been done to hide the unglamorous
reality of the Sherfield Building. Ob-
viously such a transformation is near
impossible. I still felt that a better ef-
fort could have been made in terms of
more comprehensive music and mood
lighting linking all areas of the ball.
Overall it was a pleasant night with
the standard fare. It seemed as though
everyone had a good time, and clearly
they aimed to please.
H
ow would you spend
£25,000 in one night?
A champagne fountain?
A unique performance
by your favourite band?
Would you rent out the entire Ritz Ho-
tel for one night? Maybe a speedboat
trip down the Thames in the company
of Barack Obama? The possibilities
are indeed endless.
The Seriously Social Party Compe-
tion is a chance to throw the ultimate
party with £25,000 at your disposal. If
you have not already taken the hint,
this is a plea for you, Imperial students,

A free party? Obviously there is no
such thing as a free lunch, let alone a
free £25,000 party. Mobile phone op-
erator 3 are the commercial entity be-
