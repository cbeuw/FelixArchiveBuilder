I
was mindlessly sifting through
BBC iplayer last night when I
came across something which
sparked my interest – an hour
long documentary about Cana-
dian60s/70srockerNeilYoung.“Mildly
interesting” I thought, as I dispassion-
ately pawed the computer into action,
“A nice way to kill the evening at least”.
Music documentaries rarely impress:
unless you know the story already they
tend to be a mess of namedrops and
tours schedules, peppered with obliga-
tory Rock’n’Roll lifestyle clichés. What
followed though was one of the most
musically mind-expanding TV watch-
ing experiences I have ever had.
The documentary itself was some-
what mediocre – an endless parade
of the friends of Young scrambling to
convince the audience how impor-
tant they were in his musical develop-
ment, and Young himself managing
perhaps half a dozen interesting com-
ments in between long bouts of be-
ing a narcissistic prick, but it was the
musical soundtrack that made this into
something excellent. Obviously it was
almost entirely Neil Young composi-
tions, each song played to illustrate
the music being made in each era, but
until then I had written him off as a bit
of a one-trick pony, rising out of the
often predictable burble of ‘popular
rock legends’ to create Harvest, only
to fall quickly back down again into
the homogenous mass of Rock Hall
of Fame inductees. For this opinion, I
could not eat any more of the humble
pie than I did during the course of the
documentary.
Beginning with tunes by his first
band ‘the Squires’ at age 16, the music
progressed through compositions dur-
ing his stints with (fellow Rock Hall of
Famers) Buffalo Springfield, through
to Crosby Stills Nash and Young, and
finally to his successes as a solo artist
up to the present day, and I don’t think
there was a dud among them. His mu-
sic is honest, creative, and without a
hint of pretention.
It kind of got me thinking though -
when I first started watching it, I was
almost expecting uninteresting, samey
tunes about girlfriends and skateboard-
ing, so cynical have I become by the
state of popular rock music in mod-
ern musical times. There is something
that rock from the 60s and 70s has that
seems to have got glossed out in our
age of technocratic overproduction.
What that something is is some-
what up for debate. The easy answer
would be originality, although I don’t
think this is too accurate – no-one has
done exactly what Coldplay or Keane
or whoever are doing before, but that
doesn’t stop it from leaving an un-
satisfying, hollow taste in the ears. I
think the more worrying deficit is in
its honesty – some of these bands al-
most sound like their music was writ-
ten in response extensive focus group
research. It begs the question though:
how is anyone supposed to relate to
music created to pander towards large
audiences, rather than challenge and
stimulate them? How long can this
industrialised mass-consumption con-
tinue when it’s devoid of any emotional
stimulus? Answers on a postcard.
The Domino State opened the show
with an unsatisfying performance that
was too easily ignored and forgotten.
As an odd choice of support they failed
to connect well with the crowd, only
managing to raise a slight nod here and
there. The generic feel of their set was
punctuated by a few hints of interest-
ing and unique sounds, but these were
discarded before they gained any mo-
mentum, leaving the songs fairly direc-
tionless and making The Domino State
a frustrating live act.
The main man behind M83, An-
thony Gonzalez, came on stage sur-
rounded by his three tour companions
who’s help he had enlisted in perform-
ing his creations live. Taking his posi-
tion amongst laptops, keyboards and
bizarre looking electronics, his album
vocalist Morgan Kibby stood opposite
him ready to provide extra keyboards,
Loic Maurin brought the drums and
Pierre-Marie Maulini had the bass and
guitar covered.
Expectant ears and eager eyes were
upon the French man as M83 opened
their set with ‘Run Into Flowers’ from
‘Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts’.
The fast pace of the keyboards and
sampled sounds built with echoing
vocals, creating a mesmerizing and
spine chilling performance that set the
standard high for the rest of the show.
Anthony has a way of crafting incred-
ibly epic and amazing songs which
work beautifully in the context of an
album but, as they proved, are equally

Damn mobiles! If they weren’t so useful
to my social life, for listening to music
and playing games and accessing the
internet on the go and waking me up
in the mornings and stuff, I probably
would have chucked mine out of the
window years ago. Anthony Gonzalez,
front man of French electronic shoe-
gazers, M83, took few minutes out of
a busy UK tour to talk about live shows
and their latest album, ‘Saturdays =
Youth’, but technology had other ideas
and it wasn’t until we were cut off once
that the interview started…
Looking at your touring schedule,
you’re playing in Manchester
tonight?
Yes, yes we are playing tonight in Man-
chester. That would be the first time!
Any Madonna-like pre-concert
rituals before you guys take the
stage?
[laughs] No rituals. We like to have a
good meal and go to a good restaurant.
We like to have sushi before we go on
stage and yeah, drink a bit of alcohol!
Congratulations on your Scala
gig! I went with a friend who’s
reviewing the gig and we were
both curious as to why your
drummer is in a box?!
Because I think it looks good on stage –
I like it! But no, it’s also because other-
wise there is too much sound because
those drums can be very loud. So it’s
just a question of sound level.
What’s your favourite song to
play live?
[Thinks for a bit] I don’t know, I like to
play ‘Don’t Save Us From The Flames’
because a lot of people are expecting
that song during the live show. And I
like ‘Couleurs’ on the new album.
Is there one song that you’ll
never play live, or do you give
everything a chance?
We never really play songs from the
previous albums because it is always
difficult to reproduce the sound of the
album live, you know? And it’s quite
difficult to play some of the songs from
those previous albums. For example,
we never play the last song from our
last album, ‘Lower Your Eyelids To Die
With The Sun’, because it’s very long
and very produced so it’s almost im-
possible to play.
What made you want to make an
album about your teenage years?
Just one minute! [at this point, some-
thing clicks and whirrs in the back-
ground]. I mean, yeah, I’ve always
been fascinated by teenagers and also
because I was really happy as a teen-
ager and it was some of the best days of
my life so far. So this album is kind of a
tribute to that.
What kind of music were you
Anthony Gonzalez looking moody and brooding. What a dreamboat. What I’d give to be that microphone
listening to then and how has
it influenced the music you’re
making?
Oh, mostly rock music like and the
New York scene and also a lot of Ger-
man music from the seventies. Be-
cause of the German music, I started
to buy keyboards and synthesizers and
I started to play electronic music. And
because of bands like Mogwai who
have a lot of guitar, I satarted to learn
the guitar and play rock music as well.
I think that my music ‘looks’ like my
influences, just a mix of the music I
love, a combination of everything I like
in music.
German music? So like Kraftwerk,
perhaps?
Not Kraftwerk in particular. More like
Popol Vuh and Tangerine Dream and
these kinds of bands.
So what kind of music are you
listening to now?
I’m listening to a lot of classical music
and popular music. I’m listening to a
lot of albums this year; I think it has
been a good year for music. I really like
the Fleet Foxes album!
Why the 80’s? A lot of people are
going back to that era in terms of
fashion, films and music. Why do
you think that is?
I don’t know, I think 80’s music is cer-
tainly one of the most important for
the music industry and for music his-
tory. It’s definitely one of the most in-
teresting periods. A lot of bands from
the 80s, they have invented something,
like a sound that really created some-
thing new. I really like the sound pro-
duction on the albums from the 80s. I
think it sounds always amazing – it’s
really different from the 70s. There’s
this really big gap for me between the
70s and the 80s.
It’s been over six months since
S=Y came out. Are you happy
with the reception?
M83, located in the Centaurus group
“We like to have
sushi before we
go out on stage”
Yeah! It’s been a while since the previ-
ous album and it’s really encouraging
for the future. I’m really excited to tour
for this album and it’s been very posi-
tive overall!
Would you do anything
differently?
It’s very difficult to create and compose
an album – the most difficult thing for
an artist! I spent so much time on it and
so much energy, but I think it’s a good
album for now and I just can’t wait to
work on another one.
Probably a scary question, but
you’ve hinted at it earlier on: any
ideas for the next album?
It’s too early to say, because my head
is so focused on the tour right now –
we’re touring until the end of the year
and at the end it’s going to be very dif-
ficult for me to work on anything new.
But I have some ideas in my head.
Can we expect an album based
on 90s youth, maybe?
[laughs] Yeah, maybe! But it would be
for sure different.
And then, just as the conversation
veered towards their up-coming tour
supporting Kings of Leon, the line
drops. So we’ll never, ever hear if he
has any words of wisdom for the cur-
rent youth, or whether, as his latest al-
bum title indicates, Saturday is still the
best day of the week. Perhaps we can
answer that last one for ourselves.
M83’s latest album, ‘Saturdays =
Youth’ is out now and they will tour
with Kings of Leon around the UK in
December.
“I’ve always
been fascinated
by teenagers”
Jorge Costa
as impressive as a live performance.
Neglecting earlier work off the
self titled album, the set is filled pre-
dominantly with songs from ‘Before
the Dawn Heals Us’ and ‘Saturdays =
Youth’. Despite the differences between
these two albums the set manages to
fit together well keeping the crowd
enthralled throughout. ‘A Guitar And
A Heart’ and ‘Moon Child’ showed off
the band’s more shoegazing-electroni-
ca moments while synth-heavy pop
songs ‘Graveyard Girl’ and ‘Kim and
Jessie’ receive the greatest response
from the crowd.
Anthony’s softly whispered vocals
contrast skillfully with the throbbing
keyboards on ‘We Own The Sky’. It
would have been an obvious choice to
end with ‘Lower Your Eyelids To Die
With The Sun’, one of the most perfect
album closing songs which was sadly
missing from their set, but instead the
encore brings ‘Couleurs’.
M83 easily filled the Scala, the ven-
ue’s size creating an intimate feel with-
out cramping their atmospheric sound.
It will be interesting to see if they man-
age to stay so engaging and exciting
when they perform in the O2 Arena
and Wembely Stadium where they are
supporting tedious indie pretty-boys
Kings of Leon this December.

The introductory EP from Darke
Horse is a mixed bag – there’s clearly
a lot of talent there, with a front-man
you can almost see jumping around
on-stage despite the studio production
and an axe-man who’s clearly knows
his way round his six strings and isn’t
afraid to rip out a solo on demand.
On the down-side, the songwriting
With a name like this, I was expecting
a proper rude-boy two step track, but
the combination of soulful vocals, laid
back brass and electro backing actu-
ally creates a sound that belongs firmly
alongside that Fun Lovin’ Criminals
CDs you play when you get home after
a late night out. It’s cool without being
self-conscious, and as a result sounds
like they’ve had a lot of fun making it.
On the flip side, that’s not always

NME et al drawing the usual paral-
lels between fellow St Albaners Enter
Shikari and linking them with ‘new
rave‘ clearly hasn’t bothered Friendly
Fires much, as they have retained the
cowbells and synths from the original
release of ‘Paris’ last year. In addition,
this time round they’ve added some
beefed up production which, combined
with some girly backing vocals cour-
tesy of Au Revoir Simone, make this
essentially a mass pleasing pop song.
OK they might have lost their edge a
bit, but who can blame them - it’s done
wonders for their airplay. They were
on Jools Holland don’t you know...
is what you might describe as ‘a work
in progress’. The EP title track’s verse
riffs are shamelessly lifted from EMF’s
‘Unbelievable’, which is a pity consider-
ing that bouncing around to the cho-
rus would otherwise be quite good
fun – although that might be because
it doesn’t have any of the largely banal
lyrics scattered throughout the rest of
the song. The second rack suffers simi-
larly: although the chorus is quite cool
– ‘Jack’s My Friend’ referring to booz-
ing your way out of a crisis – the rest
of the lyrics are simply awful, and the
Franz Ferdinand feel across the rest of
the track doesn’t help much either.
The third song’s a bit more fun,
though – ‘Reinvent Your Accent’ is a
tirade against the Arctic Monkeys that
they haven’t even pretended to dis-
guise, and the result is a much sharper
track, with a hint of real bitterness.
Unfortunately, the three-chord guitar
riff makes them sound like a poor Sta-
tus Quo cover band, which probably
wasn’t the desired effect. This band
could be one to watch over the next
year or so, but at the moment they still
sound like a band playing covers so
there’s a fair bit of polishing going to
be required before they break the big-
time.
Fat Freddy’s drop - just sort of hangin’ out, you know?
to be encouraged: the job’s to make a
good record, not to spend five minutes
of your life making noodly sounds with
unusual equipment whilst gazing at
your navel, a la recent Radiohead. This
suffers from similar problems in patch-
es – although the electronic kit delivers
a pretty phat bass-line, the 80s synth
ray-gun noises make you wonder what
the band were doing when the rest of
us realised they were naff some twenty
years ago (those of you who were born
twenty years ago, anyway). Over-
all, though, the track’s a well-crafted
come-down number, best enjoyed on
a beach at sunset. Or failing that, try
it on your balcony with a crafty joint
when you get in from the pub.
“the job is to make
