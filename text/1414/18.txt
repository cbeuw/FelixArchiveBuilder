Stuff IC Students Like!? :)
Photoshop Competition - 6

Coffee Break Editor
T
his week has been busy.
It’s been busy down in
the felix office, it’s been
busy within my hall of
residence, it’s even been
busy with my course. I certainly hope
it hasn’t been this busy for you. Busy
people get stressed, and stressed peo-
ple do bad things. Bad things lead
to heart attacks. I can tell you that I
am almost at that stage. If there is no
Coffee Break next week then you will
know why. Please tell my mother I love
her. My collection of DVD’s are to go to
my brother, and my laptop destroyed,
melted down and reformed into a stat-
ue of me.
I am afraid again there will be no
Sikh MC this week. In an executive
decision, he’ll appear next term, and
we have various ideas for the charac-
ter to introduce in the third term. The
FUCWIT league is going strong. I was
mighty impressed with the number of
entries this week. You guys obviously
want to win an iPod. Why the hell
not, it’s all about the reader participa-
tion in felix. The more you enter and
the quicker you submit your entry, the
more points you win. What do points
win you? PRIZES!!! Oh yeah. We’ll an-
nounce the winner in the first issue of
the spring term, so we can have the
Chistmas special crossword included
in the fist give away.
At this point I’d like to thank all of
you. Not only for the interest in what is
arguably the best section in any news-
paper (puzzles and games. I’m not that
arrogant), but I’d also like to thank you
forvotingformeintherecentelections.
No I didn’t become the president of the
United States of America, but you have
voted me in as your Student Trustee.
Awesome stuff. Almost as awesome as
the competition in the nightlife section
this week. Flick on over for you chance
to win a ticket to FABRIC on the 18th
of November. Calvin Harris and Plump
DJs will be there, and Plump DJs are
just plain sick head. Only one way to
describe this awesome night is by say-
ing “BUCK WILD.” Don’t worry if you
didn’t win though. Tickets are only £12.
I’m not sure if what I just wrote counts
as advertising, but ah well.
The ever strong Snaky B continues
his reign of terror for another week. I’ll
be honest with you guys, we’re start-
ing to run out of ideas. If you have any,
email them in to coffee.felix@imperial.
ac.uk and we’ll be more than happy to
use them. This week Snaky B is Alex
McKee, who to be blunt, a lot of you
guys won’t know. We down here love
McKee for his witty banter, legendary
comments and awesome style. Don’t
worry if you have no clue what’s going
on, we’ll get some one you know next
week.
6. Top Gear:
One of the most watched shows
every year by student at Impe-
rial College is Top Gear. Every
wednesday when the new show
comes out I see at least 30 people
crammed in the common room
watching attentively as Jeremy
Clarkson waffles on about new
cars, has his celebrity in the top
gea reasonably priced car and sets
the Stig around the Top Gear track
in a new sports car. The most en-
joyable part of the well produced
show being the random challeng-
es Clarkson, Hammond and May
complete every week. In the most
recent episode they became lorry
drivers, entertaining up with pow-
er slides, races and crashes. It’s
the kind of comedy more suited
to adults, and apparently Imperial
College students. This may be the
fact student appear more mature
at IC. Thusly understanding the
grumpy old men and their rants.

This weeks winner. Team Rubbish Next weeks RAW image for you to go wild. See www.felixonline.co.uk
Congratulations to this week’s win-
ner, Team Rubbish. This is quite
possibly the funniest Photoshop to
date. It’s got everything. Obama, the
Pope., light sabers and laser eyes.
Freeking sweet how the Pope’s hands
are detached from his body. Nice use
of effects here guys, drop shadow be-
hind Obama is sweet. And the comic
“BOOM” with the nuclear explosion
head has lots of LOL factor. Keep up
the good work, and please enter again.
Drink with me, I’m Snaky B
and this week I’m dressed as Alex McKee (this is an inside joke)
O
h hai!. It’s me snaky B
dressed up as the leg-
end that is McKee. I
know only about 20 of
you will get this, but
I’ll carry on anyway. McKee up. If you
couldn’t ell I like sailing, my iPhone
and Larger. A bit ironic that a pint of
snake bite is drinking a bottle of stella,
but hey i’m Alexander McKee.
I used to be a big deal when I was at
university, this was probably because
I was the main man of Nerve the stu-
dent media hub of Bournemouth Uni-
versity. Now I’m the Communications
and Sponsorship officer for the Union.
Seems pretty relevant to me. I’m they
guy who makes all the awesome post-
ers you see, and get money for stuff.
Awesomz.
When I’m not drinking or being so-
cial, I’m playing my PS3. I just got it,
and it’s mega. I could spend days play-
ing Little Big Planet. McKee down.
Well this week I was dresseed as Al-
exander McKee. Who will I be next
week? I don’t even know. How crazy is
that? Tune in next week folks to find
out.
Oh Top Gear, how we love you... I don’t know why though.

I’m McKee, off to the sea!!!
Dr Stika
Coffee Break Poet
My Goth Chick
“A rave down by the cemetery?”
I pause and think about it
Expect some moral dilemma to
appear
But I just shout down the phone
“HELL YEAH”
I get into my car and before I know
it I’m there
Fred’s waiting in front, not that I re-
ally care
He’s a good guy, but a bit of a dick
And I’m just there to score some
goth chicks
Music is blazing, and he’s not alone
There must be 50 people dancing on
tombstones
Nah, I still don’t feel like any of this
is wrong
It’s a killer party, and I fucking love
this song
A few hours later, I’m off my face
Fred’s droppin acid, and being a dick
I’m chattin up girls, but they’re not
to my taste
What I really want is a crazy goth
chick
So we all prance round like it’s the
end of the world
Sweaty drunk boys and wasted young
girls
When suddenly I spot her from
across the crowd
“I can’t hear what you’re saying, the
music’s too loud”
That’s what she thinks, I’m just not
making sense
On my 20th shot and I’m fucked out
my head
I’m slurring and cursing but she
thinks I’m cute
“Let’s find somewhere quiet, bring
that bottle of booze”
We walk for a while, sit behind some
trees
We talk and we laugh, downin that
whiskey
She’s beautiful, I swear it’s not just
the drink
Her skin so soft and pale, the perfect
goth chick
Our eyes meet, and they get along
just fine
We start making out, havin a good
time
I take off her clothes, and she takes
off mine
Great sex on a grave just isn’t a
crime
It lasts for hours, I say she is the best
That I’ve ever had, I do not disgress
Up against that tombstone, she says
she’s in love
I bang her so hard I can’t feel my
nuts
Then all these lights shine in my
eyes
Standing there staring, 30 people or
more
And it’s at that point I realize
That I had been fucking a dead
corpse.
The high res picture can be found on-
line. Click on Coffee Break in the sec-
tions tab. Email your entry to coffee.
felix@imperial.ac.uk with your team
name and .PSD file and you’ll be en-
tered into the FUCWIT league.
This week’s image is of our very own
DPEW, Hannah Theodorou. Also in-
cuded is DPCS Lily Topham. The im-
age was taken during the last council
meeting. It it just me or does it look
like Hannah is on X–Fector?
Virgo
In the week that
Mars aligns with
Uranus, your
fortunes are likely to
take an unfortunate
tumble. In particular
refrain from inserting inanimate objects in
your own anus, because the perforation-
likeliness index has increased by 157% in the
last month. Stick to lubricated fingers instead.
Just don’t forget to cut your nails first.
Scorpio
Anyone else going
through a bit of a
grumpy period?
Normally when
people annoy me
I mutter ‘twat’
and walk off, safe in the knowledge that they
are infact twats. However recently I have an
overwhelming urge to rip a brick out of the
wall and smack them with it. Guys you’ve been
warned- so watch out.
Libra
This week Mars
comes in-line with
Venus and they de-
cide to have a dance
on Jupiter as that’s
the only club which
can hold that much testosterone. The results
will be spectacular, imaginative and not to be
missed. Very much unlike giving Phil Collins
a microphone, or a drum kit for that matter.
Didn’t he play piano too?
Sagittarius
For the past few
days you’ve been
toying with the idea
of coming to felix
office bearing gifts
such as food, beer
and good looks. Much like the 3 kings. Well
where the hell are you? I am pretty sure that
the lack of nautral light combined with this
franlky obsurd diet program has curdled to
give me the personality of Hannibal Lecter.
Capricorn
Its not that we
choose to babble
about shite here,
it’s you guys. As
long as you keep
expectantly opening
your felix to the Horoscopes we’ll continue to
write them. If however you start to feel that
the standard is dropping, please do feel free
to keep your opinions to yourself, as we just
couldn’t give a shit. Right all done now. Pint?
Cancer
“Can I sit upstairs?”
the teenage girl that
thinks she so special
that she deserves to
sit in a part of the
restaurant that is
not open yet.
“I’m sorry, my love, we don’t have staff up-
stairs, so I let you upstairs.” She seems offend,
as if defeated by my completely reasonable
answer. (Go to Leo for rest of it!)
Gemini
will feel something
down their pants
and then get scared
as they wouldn’t
know what to do.
Yes I am feeling
a bit angry, but I thought in the absence of
Angry Geek this week, you guys have got me/
us/them/you. If you don’t like it, deal with it, I
suggest you write in your little angry rants to
us to ihatefelix@imperial.ac.uk.
Leo
After ordering and
paying she says to
me as-a-matter-of-
factly,
“Actually, I prefer
to sit upstairs!”
“Honey, I prefer to be in the Bahamas with
lovely girls massaging my
feet, but I’m not, so table 5 is over there!”
To add insult to injury, I tripped her up on the
way to the table. She’ll get over it.
Taurus
Why the hell do we
need 7000 condoms
and 3000 sachets of
lube? Whadafuh?
How active do you
really think people
are here? Most of them are wasted on water
bombs or put on other peoples heads to blow
up with their nose! How about you get 7000
viagras first and then see what happens, even
those low sex drive geeks (go to Gemini!)
Aries
What the hell
happened to all
those people who
said they really
wanted to write for
felix? ‘Oh I love the
horoscopes, but they get repetitive. Can I help
out on them?’ Of course you can, but will you
actually do it, hell no. So instead you leave it
us to do them last minute and all you end up
getting is waffle.
Pisces
How many roads
must a man walk
down before you
can call him a man?
What the hell are
these music guys
on? Think of a proper theme to your songs,
instead of just putting words together that
rhyme. To be fair, it looks like I’m doing the
same here, but the difference is that I know
I’m chatting shit!
Horoscopes: the definitely not rushed edition
Aquarius
This week you
begin to wonder
about some of life’s
great questions. If
no one is in the for-
est and a tree falls,
does it make a sound? Of course it bloody
does, just because you’re not there doesn’t
mean there is no sound. Whadafuh!!!! What
kind of mindless jibber jabba is this guy talk-
ing about, moron!
This weeks horoscopes can be found below. If that was helpful you’re an idiot.
