‘Should we subsidize pre-schools?’- a debate between
man and AI
E
arlier this month,
IBM Research
and Intelligence
Squared U.S.
sponsored an event where
Project Debater, IBM’s
AI debating machine,
and Harish Natarajan, a
debating expert, discussed
whether pre-schools
should be subsidized.
Both sides had fifteen
minutes to prepare on the
topic given on the spot.
There was a four-minute
opening statement, a
four-minute rebuttal round
and a two-minute summa-
ry. At the end, while the
majority of the audience
declared Natarajan to be
the winner of the round,
Project Debater’s per-
formance was praised by
many.
Project Debater made
its opening argument by
supporting the idea of
subsidizing pre-schools,
citing findings on the
positive effects of subsi-
dization from studies and
historical research. The AI
grounded its argument on
the idea that subsidization
should stem from a moral
and political obligation
to the public, citing
findings from researches
that showed that an early
investment in an individ-
ual’s education will lead
to a more successful life
in terms of health and
income. It also cited how
those individuals will be
less likely to lead a life of
crime, which will increase
the safety of a neighbour-
hood.
Natarajan made his
opening argument by
siding with the opposi-
tion, saying that subsi-
dization doesn’t effec-
tively address issues like
poverty and crime rates in
a country. He argued that
it is simply a ‘politically
motivated giveaway to
the middle class’, who
probably already have
their children enrolled in a
pre-school. He argued that
other programs would be
more effective in tackling
such important issues.
Throughout the rest
of the debate, both sides
provided interesting and
insightful views on the
topic, though they varied
in style and approach.
Project Debater used data
to support its arguments,
while Natarajan used his
experience and skills to
‘reframe the debate about
where government dollars
could be best used to
ensure social equality.’
The winner was the
one who was the most
effective at convincing
the audience about the
persuasiveness of the
arguments put forth and
was determined through
a live, online polling.
Before the debate, 79%
of the audience believed
that preschools should be
subsidized while 13% dis-
agreed and 8% were un-
decided. Afterwards, 62%
agreed that preschools
should be subsidized
while 30% disagreed.
Natarajan won.
The thing to note,
however, is not who won
at the end, but rather the
fact that both sides only
had fifteen minutes to
prepare for this debate
and didn’t know of the
topic beforehand. This
means that the AI was
not only gathering the
most relevant information
needed to support a side
and formulating that into
a paragraph, but was
also actively listening to
what was being said by
Natarajan and responded
to him with its “own,
unscripted reasoning” to
convince the audience
of its position. This is an
important step forward on
the long road to teaching
an AI to master a human
language.
knowledge about the topic
at hand’, while only 20%
said the same of Natara-
jan.
In a discussion after
the debate with four-time
Emmy award winner John
Donvan, Natarajan, Dr
Ranit Aharonov and Dr
Noah Slonim (latter two
being part of the primary
researchers behind
Project Debater), it was
unanimously agreed that
it was a historically signif-
icant evening. Aharonov
explained that Project
Debater should be seen
to have huge potential
in ‘[understanding] both
sides of a problem and
presenting all the pros
and cons so you have a
wider view of the topic
and then can make a better
decision’.
In other words, the
primary researchers
working on Project
Debater aren’t building
this AI in order to argue
better than a human,
which many viewers
were rightfully concerned
about, but rather so that
it can present sides of an
argument that a human
might not even have
thought of due to their
biases/prejudices. The
true potential of this
would be to augment
human decision-making,
without replacing the
human decision maker.
Slonim added: “Ulti-
mately, what we saw was
that the interaction of man
and machine could be
enriching for both.”
While this is a very
long-term goal that can
only be achieved once
the AI works effective-
ly, that evening was a
huge step forward in a
more short-term one of
‘[mastering] the complex
and rich world of human
language.’

Spoiler alert: the AI lost, but not without putting up a good fight.
