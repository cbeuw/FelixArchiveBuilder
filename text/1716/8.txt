So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed: The guillotine of
modern life?
From democratisation of justice to weapons of destruction, our voices create a stage for shaming at an
unprecedentedly large scale
A
s suggested by
the title itself,
So You’ve
Been Publicly
Shamed explores the
world of the internet
with compassion seem-
ingly absent and every
flaw amplified. In it, the
author Jon Ronson de-
tails his interviews with
those who were victims
of ruthless attacks, per-
haps for a bad joke or an
immature photo posted
online, and sheds light
on the aftermath of those
shamings, from jobs lost
to rape threats.
We, once the voice-
less, are given voices by
the internet and social
media, given authority
to enforce morals as
we see fit and given
roles, such as social
control police. We stand
up against injustices,
criticise the fraudulent,
and topple the giants -
things we never thought
possible - all with this
combined force. But
slowly, it has evolved
into intensive scrutiny,
where we search for that
one politically incorrect
statement and tear its
owner apart, all in the
pursuit of justice.
Ronson starts off with
the example of Jonah
Lehrer, a pop science
author exposed for
misquoting Bob Dylan
and subsequently crit-
icised for his apology
speech for which he
received $20,000. He
was fired from his job,
and his 2016 release A
Book About Love was
immediately probed
for potential plagia-
rism and factual errors
and received largely
negative reviews.
Another example
highlighted in the book
is when PR executive
Justine Sacco tweeted,
“Going to Africa. Hope
I don’t get AIDS. Just
kidding. I’m white!”
Although poorly
phrased, it was obvious
that Sacco intended the
statement satirically.
In fewer than 140
characters, that tweet
blew up on the internet
and flipped Sacco’s
life upside down. Crit-
icisms, accusations,
threats, personal attacks
all flocked in as social
media influencers
rallied their followers
to do the same. Those
who spoke up for her,
pointing out that it
was merely terrible
attempt at humour, were
immediately labelled
racist. Then, Sacco was
notified that she had lost
her job.
All of those conse-
quences just because
of a tweet seems like a
“Jon Ronson’s
writing
reads like a
documentary
in literary
form”
hefty price to pay for
a 140-word mistake.
There is no forgiveness
in this dictionary that is
the world of the internet.
In real life, if one were
to make a mistake, it is
social convention that
we accept an apology
and move on. But this is
not the case when things
are taken online, espe-
cially when the world
judges you with the first
thing that turns up in the
search engine, however
untrue that representa-
tion may be of you.

“We are
defining the
boundaries of
normality by
tearing apart
the people
outside of it”
Jon Ronson’s writing
reads like a documen-
tary in literary form,
combining aspects of
journalism, advocacy,
and expression of his
personal opinions. It is
expected that he sets the
theme around a central
idea, with a few main
building blocks that
portray different cases
of online shaming. But
I find it strange that he
mentions many tangen-
tially related topics with
interesting potential
but only covers them
briefly. For instance, he
includes his experience
in a shame-eradicating
workshop and Texas
Judge Ted Poe’s con-
troversial use of hu-
miliation when issuing
sentences. One subject
that I found particularly
fascinating and had
hoped to read more
about is how women
and men are treated
differently as victims of
shame, with men facing
mainly the consequence
of getting fired whilst
women receiving rape
and death threats. It
would have been better
if Ronson had made
a clear choice, either
structuring the book
in a more streamlined
manner or addressing
those tangential subjects
more thoroughly and
adding another layer of
depth.
It is perhaps an in-
trinsic human flaw that
hiding behind a blank
avatar brings out the
worst in us and strips us
of empathy and respect.
It could be that we are
so eager to elevate our-
selves that we resort to
the humiliation of others
to satisfy this need.
More often than not, we
have confused activism
with conformity and
blatant bullying. It is
distressing to see that
we can be so sensitive
about what is politically
correct that we can treat
others so wrongly for
that reason. As Ronson
puts it, “We are defining
the boundaries of nor-
mality by tearing apart
the people outside of it.”
“We, once the
voiceless, are
given voices
by the internet
and social
media”
This book was
released almost four
years ago, and many
things have changed
since then - Justine Sacco
has landed a job; the
users of Ashley Madison
were publicised; doxing
and cyberstalking have
bloomed. It is hard to
predict what trajectory
we are moving towards,
but one thing is for sure,
to quote Ronson, “The
great thing about social
media was how it gave
a voice to voiceless
people. Let’s not turn it
into a world where the
smartest way to survive
is to go back to being
voiceless.”
