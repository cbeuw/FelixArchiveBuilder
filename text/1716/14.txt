Mix! An
Indian street
food stall known for its
long queues and vibrant
aromas (that’s not us
bragging – it’s feedback
from our customers!) For
anyone that hasn’t met
us yet, we are part of the
Farmers Market that is
located on Queens Lawn
every Tuesday. We write
this piece following an
encounter with Andy,
the Felix Editor, who
happened to stumble upon
our stall for a late lunch
one Tuesday. Following
a series of conversations,
he proposed the idea
of a page dedicated to
Mumbai Mix in the next
edition of Felix! We were
ecstatic at this proposition
as we rarely get to pres-
ent ourselves on paper.
This article gives us the
opportunity to showcase
ourselves both as a brand
as well as on a personal
level. For our regular
customers who probably
have some understanding
of our background, this
article will piece together
some of the puzzle. For
those that have never been
to our stall, this gives you
an insight into Mumbai
Mix, its founders and the
principles on which the
business operates.
Mumbai Mix is a family
run business founded in
2014 by a team of mother
(Mohini) and two daugh-
ters (Deshna and Dimple).
We offer a range of Indian
dishes commonly found
on the streets of Mumbai.
However, our rich cultural
background (Indian,
Kenyan and British)
influences our choice of
ingredients and cooking
practices thereby giving a
contemporary and unique
edge to every dish we
serve at the stall. The
most popular dish is the
Dosa wrap – a lentil and
rice pancake with a slow
roasted potato and onion
filling that is served with
an array of freshly made
chutneys: coconut-cori-
ander, roasted red pepper
and tamarind & date
chutney.

our menu. For instance,
our autumn special is
a squash and pumpkin
filling whereas the spring
special is a Wild Garlic
Dosa with a Rainbow
Chard and Paneer filling.
Our menu also consists
of a Vegetable Biryani
and potato curry, freshly
made samosas and our
exceptional masala chai
(spiced Indian Tea).

sometimes. Although we
are growing as a business,
our time is predominantly
spent within the kitchen.
That leaves us very little
time to focus on all things
“admin”. For that reason,
we are reaching out to
students who may be able
to support us with the
following tasks: photogra-
phy, videography, market
research and digital
marketing. These will be
paid tasks and we will be
happy to provide refer-

“Known for
its vibrant
aromas”
We take great pride in
our menu because we are
particular about every
aspect of our cooking
process from the choice of
ingredients to the creation
of our own spice blends
(masalas). For example,
our core ingredients are
sourcedfromlocalfarmers
because this has environ-
mental, economical and
nutritional benefits (and
we know we have a re-
sponsibility towards pro-
tecting the environment!).
Using locally sourced
ingredients also gives us
the advantage of creating
unique versions of the
Dosa batter and its fillings
enabling us to rotate
We like to please our
customers and make each
and every one of them
feel special. We also try
our best to give them a
unique experience each
time they visit the stall.
We do this by tailoring
the “spice level of their
Dosa and the sweetness
of their Masala Chai
according to their request.
Most of all, we also like
to natter and get to know
our customers. Most of
the time, we recognise our
regulars but we also have
awkward moments where
we claim to recognise new
customers! New customer
or not, it is always a
pleasure to serve the staff
and students of Imperial
College. We have to
admit, you are a chatty lot
and love Tuesdays for that
reason.
Mushy things aside,
