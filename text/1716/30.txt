eeling the pres-
sure of being the
first team to play
on the Saturday
of Bottle Match, tensions
were high but the raucous
support on the side lines
(great banners and chants
all round) quickly calmed
the nerves before the
S
unny weather
greeted the
Women’s hockey
team at Harlington
as we took first push back,.
The RSM supporters had
no competition with CSM
for being the loudest.
We had a strong start
from the attack, with
majority possession for
the first 15 minutes of
the game. Unfortunately
we had a lull where CSM
scored their first 3 goals.
But this didn’t stop us, we
managed to turn the ball
around and, for the first
time in four years, scored
A
fter the ‘true’
CSM badmin-
ton team (in
whichonly2out
of 6 players were miners
(GEOGRAPHERS)) won
the trophy last year, this
year, CSM surprisingly
bothered to send their
actual team (of course,
a NO-MINER team) to
London. However, neither
waking up at 5.30am nor
a 6-hour drive demolished
their excellent racket skills
and superb footwork.
Once again, CSM
re-emphasized their dom-
game began. The RSM
supporters had witnessed
unfortunate losses the
day before and the RSM
Lacrosse team were eager
to give them a good per-
formance and win to start
the day correctly. Their
answers were swiftly an-
swered as the CSM cheers
were almost instantly
extinguished - 3 goals
were scored by the RSM
in the early minutes due to
some great drawing from
Arianna.
The first quarter ended
with an excellent 6-1
score line to the RSM. The
second and third quarter
continued in a similar
fashion, with the highlight
being a great pass from
Arianna almost half the
pitch up to Claudia who
quickly scored after taking
the ball on the crease.
Goals from Arianna,
Annie and Matthew
during this period led to a
commanding 12-4 lead to
the RSM by the end of the
3rd quarter. At this point,
however, it seemed as if
CSM had suddenly dis-
covered some newfound
energy as the RSM team
lost some vital players to
hockey and they quickly
rallied, scoring 2 goals
past an increasingly angry
RSM Goalkeeper. In the
end though, RSM were
not to be denied, and to the
dismay of many CSM fans
the RSM played keep-ball
until the final whistle and
the game ending 12-6.

ollowing a run of
excellent league
results, RSM
Football went into
the big one in high spirits.
It had been 14 years of
pain since their last varsi-
ty victory, although on the
back of a draw and narrow
loss in the past two years,
there were whisperings
that this could be the year.
The first half was
played out in a manner
reminiscent of many a
varsity; scrappy with a
lack of clear cut chances,
but no lack of endeav-
our and some typically
crunching tackles. Some
rogue chanting from
a couple of unnamed
ex-players (one has a
black eye, the other an
unfathomable enjoyment
of a port shower), kept the
CSM players on their toes,
however the first big save
of the game was pulled
off by RSM’s resident cat
Jamie Stringer, tipping a
header over the top of the
bar after a rare breach of
their otherwise rock solid
defence.
The second half saw
the game open up, with
Mickey Yu complaining
of a cricked neck as he
panned his camera from
end to end. Captain for the
day Matthew Campbell
thought he’d grabbed the
headlines when stroking
the ball into an empty net
after a fumble from the
CSM keeper, although un-
fortunately he’d forgotten
that kicking the ball out a
goalie’s hands is illegal....
This sparked a memorable
celebration from RSM’s
yesterday man Lekan
Ogunlana, executing
repeated straight drives
with yard in hand before
being cruelly escorted off
the pitch.
The introduction of
the rapid Jake Bluston
stretched the CSM
defence, and he proved
to be the match winner in
the 87th minute, chasing
a delightfully chipped-
through ball over the top
to hold off the centre back
and slot past the keeper.
The post goal celebratory
scenes were a blur, with
many hoarse voices still
struggling to tell the tale.
After a summer of nearly’s, Football has finally come
home...

5 minutes of stress
followed, with some back
to the wall defending
ensuring the clean sheet
remained intact. After
what seemed like ages, the
full time whistle finally
sounded to prompt pan-
demonium, with players
shedding an understanda-
ble tear at the scale of the
achievement.
Amongst a blubber,
Sam ‘Bitchell’ Mitchell
whimpered that he hadn’t
cried this much since Alex
Whittaker denied him a
PhD, and Hockey young-
ster Dan Lindsey realised
he hadn’t been conceived
the last time RSM had
won the football.
In truth, this was a
game won by an excellent
defensive performance,
with George Decaude-
veine, Matthew Morris,
James ‘bullshit’ Burton-
shaw and Jamie Stringer
all outstanding. However
it was the fresher that
made the difference, Jake
Bluston for president?

our first goal!
This lifted our spirits
and spurred us to try and
pull it back and beat CSM.
Our defence and attack
both fought hard, trying to
prevent them from getting
their next goal. In the
second half, with CSM
4-1 up, the RSM crowd
were roaring and we got
off to yet again a strong
start, and about half way
through we got another
goal!
With a few more un-
fortunate CSM goals due
to their fast turnarounds
we finished the match
with a 7-2 score. Even
though this was a loss we
definitely did the game
justice and with such a
strong team, CSM didn’t
know what had hit them.
We worked so hard and
most importantly we had
a really fun game, it was a
win for us!
9-9 into the 2nd, slightly
unlucky not being able to
sneak through!
Our 5th string Oliver
Taylor-Rose was out
powered 3/0 by his
opposite number but
played some great squash
himself at time. At 2/1
down in the tie, 3rd string
Eric Newland needed to
win to keep RSM hopes
alive but was defeated in
three tight games by an
experienced opponent.
With the match gone,
some pride was restored
as our team captain and 1st
string blitzed his opposite
number 3/0, leaving the
final match score at 3-2
to CSM. With a packed
gallery and a great atmos-
phere, the Friday squash
fuelled enthusiasm for the
rest of the weekend sport,
here’s to hoping it stays
for next year!

Although the trophy is
still out there waiting to
be brought home, RSM
did much better this year.
Not only did we finally
have our personalised
team shirts on, but we
also managed to win 2
matches, with the final
score 8-2 to CSM. Despite
the fact that RSM players
were only paired up 2
weeks before, all three
pairs fought extremely
hard with good spirits and
sportsmanship.
The RSM team, un-
doubtedly, enjoyed the
short 45-min game (which
was equivalent to the
exercise of 3 normal RSM
sessions) and displayed
some fairly close games
for spectators to enjoy.
We all have faith that next
year RSM Badminton will
be crowned champions in
Bottle Match and bring
the trophy back!
Falmouth players, against
our RSM-ers, our brave
battle was no match.
The RSM team
managed to sneak past the
CSM-ers many times but
a skillful GK on the part
of the CSM scuppered
chances at closing the
score gap. This, along
with an inhumanly
accurate CSM GS, meant
that the game was CSM
dominated. With this
being said, the goals that
were scored by the RSM
were met with wild cheers
from the RSM support.
By the end of the match,
CSM remained the victors
of the Bottle Match and
the Netball win eluded us
for one more year. Despite
this, the home crowd,
homemade flags, banners,
and of course those trusty
megaphones kept the
morale high and CSM-ers
aware of the fight that the
RSM were going to bring
for the rest of the Bottle
Match weekend.
