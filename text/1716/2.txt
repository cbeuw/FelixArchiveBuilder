A long, long week
T
his week might
be the week that
Felix actually
doesn't make it
to the printers in time. I
have come disastrously
close in the past but this
week I am genuinely
worried that I am writing
this Editorial in vain.
The reason I'm worried
is because it is past
10pm and I'm only now
writing this Editorial. I
know what you're think-
ing... "But Andy, I swear
you always write your
editorial late? 10pm on a
Thursday is pretty good
for you,". This is true,
writing my Editorial at
10pm on a Thursday is
actually decent by my
usually pretty unpunctu-
al standards. However,
this week's issue of Felix
is an important one - it
includes the annual re-
view of the Sabbatical
Officers (excluding
myself) - and I am yet
to write up three pages
of the four page pullout.
Hopefully, you'll get to
see this Editorial but
I'm still sifting through
almost three hours of
audio recordings of
my interviews with the
Sabbs, so it's realistic
that this issue never sees
the light of day...
Conducting the
Sabb Review has been
eye-opening for me and
gave me a really insightful
look behind the scenes
in the Union. It is clear
to me that there is a lot
wrong with the structure
of the Union and how
things currently operate.
Chief among these issues
is the interaction and
relationship between the
student-elected Officer
Trustees and the Senior
Management Group
(SMG). Together, the
OTs and SMG form the
Leadership team within
the Union, however there
has been an apparent
disconnect between the
two at times this year.
The conversations I had
2
with the OTs indicate to
me that this disconnect is
something that has been
recognised by members
of the Union and steps are
being made to mend this
relationship.
When I interviewed
each of the Sabbs, I
made a point of asking
how realistic they think
it is to affect meaningful
change as a Sabb and their
thoughts on being left out
of big decisions made by
College and the Union
(recent examples include
the decision to stop
serving evening bar food
at h-bar and the decision
to stop the trial of Union
Breakfast). I asked these
questions because I think
it's important, particularly
with elections coming
up, for the student body
at Imperial to know the
truth about what being
a Sabb entails so that
they can make informed
decisions in the coming
weeks. The overall senti-
ment was the Sabbs was
that it is very realistic to
affect meaningful change
and there was a general
frustration at being left
out of big decisions,
especially because these
decisions often reflect
badly on them. A common
criticism that I've heard of
the Sabbs is that they are
too weak and this extends
to a long-standing criti-
cism levelled against the
Union - it has too close a
relationship with College,
which makes it impos-
siblefor it to effectively
lobby College on behalf
of the students. I hasten
to remind the Sabbs that
they are supported by
20,000 students and,
collectively, the student
voice is loud enough to
force College's hand and
ensure that the university
is run in the interest of
the students. It's crucial
that this is not forgotten
in order for meaningful
improvements to be made
for the lives of the student
body at Imperial.
remain on a year if they
are currently in their final
year to take up a full-time,
paid position.
The Sabbatical posi-
tions include the Union
President, one of four
Deputy Presidents with
individuals mandates and
spheres of responsibility,
the Felix Editor, respon-
sible for the weekly pub-
lishing of this very paper,
and the President of the
ICSMSU.

today, March 1st
, at noon.
Aspartofthecampaign-
ing for Sabbatical roles, a
live debate between can-
didates running for these
positions will be hosted
on March 6th, from 16.00
– 19.00 at Metric. The
debate will be a chance
for the candidates to elab-
orate on their vision and
motives beyond the limits
of their manifestos and
flyers. Candidates will
first be given some time to
introduce themselves, and
will then be interviewed
about their manifestos
and plans in the role. The
debate will be chaired by
Charles Titmuss, Felix
Comment Editor, who
can be watched by those
who are unable to attend
live, allowing more stu-
dents to make informed
decisions about their vote.
Another way for stu-
dents to keep up with the
debates will be through
the Felix Twitter account
(@feliximperial), which
will be live-tweeting
throughout. Students are
encouraged to submit
questions they have for
Sabbatical position can-
didates, to bring up issues
they are concerned about
and change they want to
see in the Union. These
questions can be submit-
ted ahead of the debate at

The Times hosts "Designer Babies" debate at Imperial
I
mperial’s partner-
ship with The Times
and The Sunday
Times continued
this week with a dis-
cussion of ‘designer
babies’. Tom Whipple,
science editor of The
Times and chair of the
event was joined on the
panel by IVF pioneer
Lord (Robert) Win-
ston, Dr Güneş Taylor
from the Francis Crick
Institute, and Dr Inga
Prokopenko, a reader in
as tackling the “deeply
uncomfortable question”
of how to avoid this
technology being used as
a form of eugenics against
disabled and neurodiver-
gent people.
Voting begins on
Monday March 11th
and closes on Thursday
March 14th
.. The results
of the election will be
announced the following
night on March 15th
, with
a Results party thrown to
celebrate the conclusion
of another year of Leader-
ship Elections.
These Leadership Elec-
tions will govern how the
Union is run for the next
academic year, students
are therefore strongly en-
couraged to vote and have
a say in their university
experience for the next
academic year and for
years to come.

the Union, the state of the
Union, and what they will
do to change it.”
The debate this year
comes with many im-
provements from last
year’s, which did not have
ICTV running the event.
The year before last, 2017,
ICTV was involved in
the debate and produced
videos of the debate for
each role, which can now
be found on the Imperial
College Union YouTube
channel. Though this was
not organised last year,
ICTV has been invited
back to the debate this
year, ensuring all debates

“Designer babies: the
power to control our
own evolution” was the
second event in a year-
long partnership between
the College and The

human embryos, as well
Late last year Chinese
scientist He Jiankui
claimed to have success-
fully edited the genes
of twin girls to prevent
them from contracting

this week suggests the
twins may also be better
at learning and creating
memories as a result of
the procedure.
