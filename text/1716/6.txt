Is it #TimesUp for #MeToo?
Arts Editor Claire Chan thinks that the #MeToo movement has had unintended negative
consequences

I
t’s fair to say that
the #MeToo move-
ment has been the
most significant
social upheaval of recent
times. Triggered by the
much-publicised downfall
of Harvey Weinstein, the
tremendous outpouring of
stories of both sexual as-
sault and everyday sexism
faced by women on a reg-
ular basis became a force
too powerful to simply be
ignored. All of a sudden,
the floodlights were on
sexism, sexual miscon-
duct and abuse of power
like they had never been
before. More and more
women came forward.
It was finally reckoning
time for all manner of
powerful figures – CEOs
and politicians, celebrities
and TV hosts – who, like
Weinstein, were once
thought ‘too big to fall’.
#MeToo has radi-
cally redefined how
we behave, think, and
speak about gender, sex,
and power. But like any
other revolution, it has
its downsides as well.
Last week, I wrote a
review of fanSHEN’s
interactive jury game,
The Justice Syndicate,
in which participants get
to decide the outcome
of a sexual assault case.
There was a clear power
imbalance: Huxtable, a
top paediatric neurosur-
geon, was accused by
Hodges, the mother of
one of his patients and a
struggling single mother
of two. The evidence was
designed to be equivo-
cal, as is often the case
in many actual sexual
assault cases, where
where physical evidence
is often lacking.
fanSHEN didn’t
have the explicit aim of
discussing the #MeToo
movement. They merely
wanted people to ‘think
about a challenging
topic’ and consider
how they responded to
‘situations of funda-
mental disagreement’.
Nonetheless, the way in
which my fellow jurors
responded to the simu-
lated case was telling.
Despite the paucity of
evidence (both physical
and circumstantial),
many participants were
quick to point the finger
at Huxtable. Indeed,
they claimed they ‘knew
in their heart’ that the
surgeon was guilty.
In truth, I found this
highly disturbing. How
could they assign blame
with so much conviction
when there was so little
to go on? When ques-
tioned, their response
was highly emotional.
Comparing the case to
Weinstein and other
instances where men in
power had abused their
power, they refused
to allow the ‘arrogant
surgeon’ to ‘take ad-
vantage’ of someone in
a vulnerable position.
It was almost like
reverse victim-blam-
ing. Although it seems
obvious, it was difficult
to point out to them that
the mere existence of a
power difference doesn’t
automatically mean that
power is misused.
In the case of Harvey
Weinstein, the case
against him was so-
lidified by the scores
of women who came
forward to testify,
exposing his systematic
abuse of power over
years. But not everyone
offends so serially and
egregiously. What if
previous session that ran
just after the allegations
against Brett Kavanaugh
had been made public.
That game jury quickly
found Huxtable guilty,
but it wasn’t even
about the specific case
anymore. In the wake
of #MeToo, I fear that
emotions are running
so high that it is easy to
bypass rational thought
and jump to conclusions
– a dangerous situation
when assigning blame.
There is little room for
reasoned debate about
such topics.
And yet reasoned
debate is precisely what
is needed when societal
norms change. What
was considered accept-
able a generation ago
would now be seen as
sexual assault. Consider
the iconic WW2 photo
of the US sailor kissing
a nurse on V-day. Last
week, a day after George
Mendonsa (the sailor)’s
death, a statue com-
memorating the event
was vandalised with
graffiti reading #MeToo.
Whether or not that kiss
was wrong, there cer-
tainly is a great deal of
uncertainty now about
how men and women
should behave around
each other, in both
social and professional
spheres.
Sadly, the outraged
response that #MeToo
provokes does not lend
itself well to open dis-
cussion. I find it disturb-
ing, too, that the wave of
fury extends to people
who challenge the over-
whelmingly positive re-
actions to the movement
as depicted in the media.

there is only one victim,
and the accused has no

we believe the victim?
And if so, how can we
let the accused get off
scot-free?
To be sure, it’s a hard
call in any criminal
case, not just sexual
assault ones, when cor-
roborating evidence is
lacking. More than other
crimes, however, cases
of sexual assault tend to
elicit strongly emotional
responses. In this case,
I certainly felt that my
fellow jurors’ preju-
dices severely clouded
their decision before
they’d even viewed the
evidence. The game de-

vitriolic backlash. Last
September, for instance,
Norm MacDonald’s
appearance on ‘The
Tonight Show’ was can-
celled after he said he
was ‘glad #MeToo had
slowed down’. Perhaps
not the most sensitively
worded, but hardly war-
ranting a show cancella-
tion. Actor Henry Cavill
was, equally, roundly
castigated on Twitter
track on their statements
and make very public
apologies. One wonders
just how sincere those
apologies were.
Instead of dialogue,
there seems to be a
growing culture of
avoidance and silence.
Unsurprising, when just
voicing dissent can get
a man in trouble, and a
single accusation could
ruin his career, or at least
bring it to a grinding halt
for the months of trial.
What counts as harass-
ment in the workplace
nowadays? There’s been
talk of a ‘Pence effect’
in Wall Street, named
after U.S. Vice-Presi-
dent Mike Pence, who
avoids dining alone
with any woman other
than his wife. Back in
2017, I thought this
ridiculous, but given the
highly charged climate
we now live in, I can see
why men would avoid
putting themselves in
situations which might
be potentially compro-
mising. Unfortunately,
this only makes Wall
Street (and other places)
more of a boys’ club than
it already is, and hardly
helps gender equality in
the workplace.
In our little jury,
the discussions were
overwhelmingly dom-
inated by the women
in the room. The five
men present were all
noticeably quiet. Were
they afraid to speak up
because the case con-
cerned sexual assault?
To me it reflected the
silencing effect that
#MeToo has had: keep
your head down and stay
out of trouble. Some
might celebrate the
increased dominance of
female voices at the cost
of men’s, but it would be
short-sighted to say that
this is an actual advance
in gender equality. True
and lasting changes in
attitude are not achieved
by creating an atmos-
phere of fear. To effect
social change, a conver-
sation needs to happen.

merely silencing people
