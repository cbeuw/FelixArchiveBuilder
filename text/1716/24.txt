Finally, things were a
little different in the Lord
of the Rings Committee -
it was essentially a mix of
Dungeons and Dragons
with Model United
Nations. On the one hand,
one of our delegates
declared his character a
god, which resulted in
his untimely death, while
our other elf character
delegate managed to
restore the kingdom of
Mirkwood after rising up
the ranks from a viceroy
to a high elven king.
Finally, the side of good
prevailed against Sauron’s
army thanks to the dwarf
betrayal of Sauron (yes,
you read that right) at the
end of what was a fulfill-
ing and certainly special
weekend.
Most of us were new
to this new kind of con-
ference, but we indeed
managed to perform
very well: with one
best delegate award, a
commendation and, most
importantly, only one
loss suffered (I know,
it sounds weird saying
this). Our experience was
yet another example of
how ICMUN delegations
can leave a mark in these
conferences.

“One delegate
was killed
twice one the
same day, as
two different
characters”
Morgan.
In contrast to the
previous two crises, the
Algerian War Committee
was particularly bloody
(one delegate was killed
twice on the same day, as
two different characters).
Our delegate managed to
stay alive as the Algerian
minister Lakhdar Ben
Tobbal, while organising
the resistance against the
French army. Although
there were many success-
ful killings, including that
of President De Gaulle,
a truce brought forward
by the French had to be
accepted. Nevertheless,
the conclusion was quite
shocking, as the enemy
managed to build a
nuclear bomb which was
launched on Algiers. A
drastic decision which,
had the conference contin-
ued, could have favoured
the Algerian cause: our
delegate was ready with
part of the army to coun-
terattack, so who knows
how it could have ended?
A
delegation of the
ICMUN society
took part in the
LSEMUN, held
on the main campus at
LSE in early February.
This is different than most
of the MUN conferences
as it’s completely focused
on Crisis committees, an
unusual and slightly un-
derrated ‘mode’in MUNs.
In Crisis, delegates don’t
represent countries or in-
ternational organisations,
but individual people in
various historical or fic-
tional contexts; everything
is based on your ability to
devise a good strategy to
achieve your goals and
react to random events
that can easily stop your
rise to power. People
in the same cabinet
cooperate and usually
have a common purpose.
However, betrayals are
frequent and everyone
should always watch
their back to survive (yes,
characters can be fiction-
ally killed): your number
of choices is limitless, as
long as you communicate
your clear strategy to the
Chairs - those that run the
committee.
For example, as one
of the conspirators in
the 1605 Gunpowder
plot, our delegate in-
gratiated himself with
the king, then faked his
own death, hoping to
lure King James to the
funeral of a casket full of
gunpowder. However, a
traitor betrayed us to the
Crown’s spies and the
king sent a body double.
Yet all was not lost. King
James, now embold-
ened, attended the state
opening of Parliament the
following day and, with
more gunpowder stashed
below the House of Lords,
was blown up. Funnily
enough, due to a miscom-
munication between spies,
an innocent greengrocer
was accidentally blown
up also.
In the EU Parliamenta-
ry Elections Committee,
our delegate represented
Tsipras, who was nomi-
nated as the spitzenkan-
didat for the GUE/NGL
group and campaigned
along Frederica Mogher-
ini, the nominee of the
Social Democrats (S&D)
for the same position.
The far-right ENF gained
the largest number of
seats, but it was left out of
power because the S&D
abandoned the GUE party
to combine forces with
the EPP, resulting in a
host of centrists assuming
the top posts in the Com-
mission. While someone
manufactured a scandal
about Nigel Farage and
Silvio Berlusconi hanging
out in a brothel, which
led to the now famous
hashtag #NaughtyNigel,
Pablo Iglesias and Tsipras
decided to support the
ENF’s candidates as a
protest vote against the
Social Democrats who
decided to betray them.
Another real-life House
of Cards episode took
place in the Financial
Crisis Committee, where
our delegate managed
to imprison some of the
world’s most important
CEOs as part of inves-
tigations following the
2008 crisis. Fast-forward
and the role of District
Attorney was changed to
FBI Director, leading to
meddling with internal
elections, thanks to some
foreign countries, in
order to make Obama
lose the 2012 elections

Imperial College Choir
Spring Concert - Mozart
Requiem and Haydn Te
Deum
I
mperial College Choir is one of Imperial’s
largest choirs with over 100 members, in-
cluding both staff and students. If you want
to hear what over a hundred angelic voices
sound like (singing in a beautiful setting too)
come along to our Spring Concert on Saturday
9th
March at 7:30pm in the gorgeous Holy Trinity
Church, Sloane Square. Advance tickets are just
£5 for students, or £8 on the door. Tickets are £15
in advance and £18 on the door for non-students
so this is a steal! They can be bought on the
Imperial College Choir Union website at impe-
rialcollegeunion.org or a physical ticket can be
bought from a member of the choir. We will be
singing Mozart’s Requiem, a beautiful piece that
is sure to give you goose-bumps, and Haydn’s
Te Deum Laudamus, a striking piece of music
you won’t easily forget! We would love a good
turn-out to match our efforts, as well as the efforts
of our esteemed conductor, Colin Durrant. There
will also be professional soloists and musicians
to complement our singing and make the expe-
rience even more heavenly. It promises to be an
enjoyable evening for both choral music fans and
classical novices alike, even if you just come to
see your mates perform.
Additionally, if you are a fan of choral music
then there’s still time to join Imperial College
Choir! We are non-auditioned and no singing
experience is required, but if you do have some
(singing in the shower counts), then even better.
We will hold a summer concert next term, as
well as three termly concerts next year. If you
would like to join this year, just speak to one of
our members online. Our committee can be found
on our Union website. We rehearse on Thursday
evenings, usually in the Great Hall.
If you’re a little too busy this summer term then
fear not, as you will be able to find us at Fresher’s
Fair next academic year, where we will be happy
to chat about
all things
choir, and we
will also run
free taster
sessions at
the beginning
of the next
a c a d e m i c
year.
