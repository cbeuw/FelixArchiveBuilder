Labelling The Independent Group MPs
“traitors” is exactly why they left
There is a powerful rationale for the actions of the 8 Labour MPs that left the party last week

Independent
Group MPs
left, they
were in disgust at the state
of their own parties. Let
us consider the personal
toll this must have taken.
Many MPs grew up
knowing that they wanted
to be in politics, and what
party they wanted to be
a part of. They will have
spent years working in
small dingy rooms as
researchers, walking
miles a day canvassing,
and putting on smile after
smile on the campaign
trail. Why did they do
that? Don’t tell me that it
was just power lust. These
people believed, rightly or
wrongly, that they could
make our country a better
place. They believed
in their cause and they
believed in their party. So
put yourself in their shoes,
just for a second, and im-
agine how hard it would
have been for them to turn
their backs on everything
that they had built. Why
would they do that? The
conduct of some Labour
supporters provides us
with an insight into how
far our two major parties
have fallen.
Last week, published
in these very pages, was
a tub-thumping condem-
nation of the actions of
the 8 labour MPs that
chose to leave. The article
claims that their departure
is “good riddance” and
makes a number of other
extraordinary and, in some
cases, false statements. I
fear the author has drunk
too deeply from the well of
ideology. I hope to offer a
humble refutation to some
of his more egregious
claims and, potentially,
restore some balance to
this conversation.
One of the tragedies of
the decline of the Labour
party is that its former
tolerance and inclusivity
proved to be the root of
its transformation into the
bitter and twisted party
obsessed with ideological
purity that we see today.
Corbyn has been a Labour
MP since 1983, and, when
his party was in govern-
ment, he voted against
them 428 times. Yet, he
was still accepted. It was
accepted that Labour was
home to those on the
left and, while the more
centrist leadership at the
time did not agree with
him, they never threat-
ened to chase him out of
the party or to deselect
him as an MP.
Indeed, the irony of
Corbynites condemning
Chuka Umunna as having
betrayed the party that
got him elected, is com-
pounded by a tweet from
Corbyn himself. In 2010,
when power was nowhere
in sight, Corbyn wrote “u
vote 4 ur MP”. Now that
the boot is on the other
foot, it seems such values
have swiftly faded away.
Forgetfulness regard-
ing uncomfortable truths
seems to be a trend as the
article goes on. “[7 Labour
MPs] took the unprece-
dented step of leaving the
Labour party and forming
a new centrist ‘party’,
taking the incredibly bland
name ‘The Independent
Group’”. In one sentence,
he brushes over historic
party schisms, such as the
Labour MPs that left to
form the SDP, he is guilty
of misleading the reader
by saying MPs have
formed a party - a position
he repeats despite later
acknowledging it is false
and adds a pejorative slur
that says more about the
intolerance rife in Labour
than anything else.
If these are your voters
and party members,
then I have sympathy
with Umunna and others
when they looked across
the aisle and joined
with Conservatives who
shared in their values of
“[reducing inequality]
through the extension
of opportunity” and
“[creating] fairer, more
prosperous communities”
rather than engaging is
open anti-Semitism.
I know that this is
a claim that will rouse
Do I believe that The
Independent Group is
perfect? No. Of course
not. It has been rightfully
pointed out that saying
that people of colour have
a “funny tinge” is not a
great way to start off. I
believe that she should
face investigation and
potentially expulsion. But
I think the author makes
a mistake typical of the
blinkered state that many
Jez supporters exist in. We
do not need our parties to
be completely ideologi-
cally pure. We need them
to represent our interests
and the fact that, despite
72% of Labour members
supporting a second
referendum on Brexit,
only the threat of more
defections has convinced
Corbyn to back a People’s
Vote shows that Labour
voters have forgotten this.
The author writes that
The Independent Group
is just “another regres-
sive Third Way tribute
act from the 90s”. The
tragedy is that he hasn’t
noticed, too busy insult-
ing other people, that his
own party has turned into
a bad hangover from the
70s. Maybe we could do
a bit less mudslinging and
a bit more talking about
policy?
A new party in town. // The Daily Echo
many people but it is
one that I will stand by.
Corbyn has a history of
being anti-Semitic and it
is on his watch that the
party has become a place
where Jewish people are
not welcome. If you are in
any doubt over this, I refer
you to the incident in 2012
when Corbyn protested
the removal of a mural of
a group of Jewish carica-
tures playing Monopoly,
the board resting on the
naked backs of faceless
men. I, however, prefer
to listen to the Jewish
Britons themselves who
have expressed time and
time again that they are
being targeted. If Corbyn
became PM, almost 40%
of Jews would consider
leaving Britain and The
Jewish Chronicle writes
“Corbyn threat is much
greater than far right”.
