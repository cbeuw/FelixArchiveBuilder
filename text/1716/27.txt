masochist Sintan
O’Farrell has
announced that
he is running for Deputy
President (Welfare),
apparently after having
a eureka moment when
working as a Liberation
officer.
“Although it was great
first job, I just don’t feel
like it is stretching me like
it used to anymore.”
He claims to have been
drawn to the role by the
opportunity “to represent
the student body in their
dealings with the Union
when it comes to both
mental and physical
health” and by unsub-
stantiated reports that the
Senior Management staff
intend to use him as their
whipping boy.
His duties will include
managing the Counselling
Service and lobbying for
more money to be spent
on improving the student
experience.
“I know some people
have a really hard time
here and I just want to
try and help them have
as good a time here as I
have,” he enthused. “My
motto is ‘when life gets

Speaking at the launch
of his campaign, sloganed
“Lay all of your hurt on
me”, Annika Rakin, Dom-
inatrix of the Kinky Klub,
expressed her satisfaction
with his campaign “Sinn
is the kind of guy who’s
not afraid to get down and
dirty,” she said enthusias-
tically, “he’s a natural for
the job.”
Despite some minor
gaffes he is said to be
“optimistic” about his
chances. “I mean, let’s
be honest. If not me then
who?”
“I just don’t

T
he Union has
doubled down
on its decision
to suspend an
alleged armed student
by the ankles last week
Friday, as claims by secu-
rity he was armed in Beit
Quad were found to be
ridiculously unfounded.
It was claimed that
the suspect, Ariel Ulvo,
a second year PhD can-
didate in the Department
of Materials, has created
a Facebook event stating
“Clean record, or else”,
in which he threatened
to bring a gun into the
Union building to ‘clean
house’. Sources within
the Union told NegaFelix
that Mr Ulvo was in
fact found with an old
electron gun from an old
TV. Further research, in-
volving reading the event
description, found that
the Facebook event was
actually an aggressive
PhD lab cleaning session,
which was going ahead
due to Mr Ulvo’s frustra-
tion at being the only one
who cleans the apparatus.
“I’m fucking sick of
being the only goddamn
one cleaning out the
stupid evaporator,” he
thundered. “I was @-ing
all those bum ass fools
who think I’m a maid or
something.”
When asked why he
set the venue of the lab
cleaning to the Union, Mr
Alvo responded, “I heard
the Union had some spare
bleach lying about that
they were looking to get
rid of, so we were gonna
take it off their hands.”
Alessandro Goy,
Deputy President (Incrim-
ination), was adamant his
team had made the right
call. “What we’re not
gonna do is make me look

This is not the first

regarding drugs in recent
years. Last year a meeting
of the Meat Appreciation
Society was raided, as se-
curity confused seasoning
