VZ, Bernie, and Cohen on TV
American economic imperialism continues. Bernie Sanders announces a 2020 run and
immediately breaks to the lead. Michael Cohen testifies before Congress, almost coherently.
POLITICS
Gritty
Son of God
T
he profligate son
returns, crucified
for calls to revo-
lution and arisen
after three days (and two
months or so). Keeping
with the theme – three
independent stories from
the past two weeks.
Venezuela. This is the
classic American foreign
policy pincher – place
excruciating sanctions
on “non-compliant”
democratically-elected
governments to manu-
facture a human rights
crisis, then use the human
rights “crisis” as a justifi-
cation for “humanitarian”
intervention (to install a
pro-US government). This
two-step recipe quickly
builds a failed state, which
is convenient for the in-
stallation of multinational
oil company infrastructure
on VZ land. Right outta
the ol’ playbook.
Bernie is running – his
2016 money machine
rebooted, and the other
candidates have col-
lectively (more or less)
shit the bed. These are
anti-establishment years;
adopting left-populist
policy-focused platforms
(as I have argued before)
is the most viable 2020
electoral strategy for
Democrats. So long as
Schultz doesn’t spoil the
election (quisling centrist
limousine shitlibs don’t
have the balls to reject
the Church of Fiscal
Conservatism), we have a
frontrunner.
Big fun news this
week – the Cohen testi-
mony. Donald Trump’s
former personal attorney
and “fixer” voluntarily
appeared before the
House yesterday in an
open hearing. His testi-
mony directly implicates
Trump Jr., Roger Stone,
as well as Trump himself
in conspiracy to commit
bank and tax fraud, among
other improprietous
actions (including partici-
pation in “catch-and-kill”
schemes, and several
allegations of flagrantly
racist remarks out of
Trump’s mouth – such as
“Name one country run
by a black man that’s not
a shithole”).
Most of the spice is in
the prewritten statement.
The questioning was
mostly grandstanding.
Republicans hilariously
tried to paint Cohen as
a “liar” unworthy of
congressional testimony
(Trump’s lied at least 8200
times since taking office).
Democrats, on the whole,
failed to ask substantive
questions. Special creds
to AOC for a properly
prosecutorial cross-exam-
ination towards the end.
Otherwise, tune in for a
good view of just how
inane American politics
can get.
Over the next few
weeks – more humdrum
squabbling, more Dem
oversight. Looks like
Trump Jr. will be charged
next. The Democrat
primary field will evolve;
Bernie will consolidate
his lead or start to flame
out. So long as India and
Pakistan don’t bomb each
other, presumably, we’ll
be back next week.
Alas, I ascend to the
Kingdom of Heaven,
where I shall partake co-
piously in my own blood,
and play darts with thun-
derbolts, aiming to strike
down Henry Kissinger.
“This two-step
recipe quickly
builds a failed
state.”
T
he LSE Festival,
running from
25 February to
2 March, is a
week-long series of events
aimed at engaging the
public with social science
hot topics. This year’s
theme is New World
(Dis)Orders and focuses
on the changing global
situation: a new emergent
world order where the US
is no longer the biggest
world power; rapidly-de-
veloping technology and
its implications for our
democracy; the politics
that shape our interpreta-
tion of the world...
As part of the LSE
Festival, the LSE Global
Health Initiative hosted a
panel on February 26 ad-
dressing a major question
about antibiotic resistance
policy: how can we
reshape existing global
healthcare structures, and
coordinate international
and interdisciplinary
action, to combat new
antibiotic resistance
dangers? The panel,
titled “The Drugs Aren’t
Working! Confronting
the Crisis of Superbugs”
provided broad view into
a scientific crisis whose
solutions lie largely in
policy and regulation.
The panel consisted of
professionals from Inter-
national Development,
Health Policy, Govern-
ment, and International
Relations backgrounds,
each offering solutions
to the crisis from their
disciplinary perspective,
resulting in a compre-
hensive analysis of this
policy-science crisis
intersection.
From a healthy policy
perspective, for instance,
a panelist argued that the
issue of antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) is
too interdisciplinary for
government plans to be
easily implemented. This
is despite the estimate that
investments of USD$2 per
person per year would be
enough to prevent 75% of
the related deaths, costing
much less than the World
Bank estimate of anti-
biotic resistance costing
the global economy
USD$100 trillion by
2050. Why is investment
into AMR treatment so
difficult? The Internation-
al Development panelist
contends that investment
into drug development
is inadequate because
the usual incentives for
pharmaceuticals to create
drugs do not apply to
AMR. Antibiotics cannot
be stockpiled, and must
be made universally
accessible for widespread
treatment, making it
unlikely that pharma-
ceutical companies can
earn back a profit from
the expensive process of
developing drugs.
Other than panels, the
LSE Festival includes an
exhibition and prize-giv-
ing ceremony of an LSE
student and staff social
science research com-
petition. These entries
are on show in the form
of posters, photographs,
and research abstracts.
Entries cover a vast range
of subjects, from “China’s
Two-Faced Rhetoric” to
LSE Festival – An Exhibition of Policy and
Social Science Research
