Super-talents need super-food – a
PG perspective on h-bar cuts
L
ife is our best
teacher about
how the biggest
crises can be
turned into the most fun-
damental opportunities
for change. If there is one
good thing about the h-bar
food-cut tragedy, then it is
the chance to take a step
back and rethink how we
provide and procure food
at Imperial in general.
The recent decision to
cut the SCR breakfast
and the evening supper
service in h-bar are only
examples of the many
ways in which students,
and staff, are increasingly
challenged if they want to
follow a healthy life-style.

Scientists provide us
with endless evidence
about which diets are
conducive to short-term
and long-term health. We
knowthatwithoutadrastic
reduction of animal-pro-
teins, saturated fats, salt
and sugar, we increase the
risks for coronary disease
and cancer, not to mention
the impact on the planet’s
ecosystem. The low
quality of food provided
at Imperial makes any
person sluggish, bloated
and demotivated to switch
on the brain-cells we rely
on to solve cutting-edge
scientific problems. And
let’s not even go into detail
about the increasing part
of the population sensitive
to highly-processed and
industrialised food. For
example, 10 to 15% of the
population suffer from Ir-
ritable Bowel Syndrome.

dietary culture of our
institution across all our

seriously determined to
improve the wellbeing
of our people, we need
to start at one of our top
priority human needs
which is the convenience
of access to healthy food.
As a worldwide leading
university full of top
talents, Imperial College
has the responsibility to
provide its people with
nourishing food allowing
us to thrive as a commu-
nity. Moreover, we need
to return to understanding
food as an opportunity
to socialise, to build a
community and enjoy just
being human.

Yes, we need to fight for

But let’s also lift our gaze
and look beyond h-bar and
into the future – should
we really make this a
battle about the access to a
few more fried mozzarella

on the South Kensington
campus? Or should
we engage all College

That Awkward Silence

M
ental health
provision,
awareness
and destig-
matisation is as much a
College issue as it is a
national one; yet we still
find it uncomfortable or
difficult to talk about.
Recently I attended a
workshop from the Royal
Society of Chemistry on
Wellbeing and Resilience;
though it was not exactly
what I was expecting - I
guess I didn’t pick up
as many tips on how to
support my own mental
health as I had hoped
as the session focused
mainly on our ability
to support a struggling
friend or colleague rather
than oneself - it did help
to contextualise how I
have felt previously when
trying to explain the route
of some of my own mental
health problems. In
amongst the useful tips on
how to alter our language
to be more appropri-
ate, the heartbreaking
national statistics about
mental health illness and
provision and techniques
which could help start a
conversation about mental
health, we discussed the
main problem: the way we
are programmed to listen
to each other.
What do I mean? Well,
the very thought of silence
seems to make people feel
genuinely uncomfortable
so we – in this case the
listeners – feel obliged
in a momentary silence
to jump straight in with
comment/suggestions/
ideas/anecdotes to solve
our friend or colleague’s
problem. In doing so, we
are never giving anyone
the space to feel heard
before we take all the air
time and, let’s be honest,
never really find out the
full extent of the problems.
To make matters worse,
not only have we been
programmed by society
to always fill silence, dare
I say that in our College
community as scientists
we have a certain dispo-
sition to think of logical
solutions to seemingly
simple problems, as
though it is our place
and position to determine
whether something
causing our friend or
colleague stress or worry
is ours to judge the level
of “simplicity” to it.
My point is thus, taking
the time to listen thought-
fully and completely is
something which takes
more skill and practice
than we truly give it credit
for; sometimes it is diffi-
cult to see past our own
personal view of a situ-
ation. For example, this
week is Eating Disorder
Awareness week; I
struggled with Atypical
Anorexia for around five
years but it can be almost
impossible to explain the
fear, pain and anxiety
that thoughts around
food would have on me
to another person, which
in itself discouraged me
from talking. Say I did
finally reach out for help
and I was advised by a
friend/colleague that all I
needed was to “eat more”,
I can promise you this is
neither helpful nor sup-
portive and I had actually
already figured that one
out for myself. This
may seem like a stupid
analogy, maybe it seems
obvious that it would be
unhelpful to tell someone
with anorexia to eat, but
then why did I hear that
very phrase so often?
Fundamentally everyone
was so desperate to help
and it truly came from a
place of caring, but also
of misunderstanding,
and we do this far too
often without even re-
alising. Often someone
struggling with a mental
health problem knows
the “simple solution”,
jumping into a conver-
sation when someone is
confiding in you to tell
them something they
may already know may
actually at times be coun-
ter-productive because it
can feel dismissive.
This is not to say you
shouldn’t talk to anyone or
never give advice; rather
the opposite, sometimes
the support from a friend
is the first step to recovery.
But maybe, when there’s
that inevitable awkward
silence or a problem
seems to have a simple
solution, bite your tongue
for a few more seconds
and encourage your friend
to keep talking a little bit
more – there might be
more to it than the first
break in the explanation.
T
he PhD student
– supervisor
relationship is a
strange one; it is
rare that in a workplace
you would have a single
boss for three to four years
or have the flexibility to
come into work at 11am
and have the freedom to
take three hours for lunch
if you so wish. Then again,
a PhD isn’t a normal job;
it is understandable that
your PhD supervisor
doesn’t have to behave
like a normal boss. When
I started my PhD, I ex-
pected that I would have
to manage my own time
and experiments. That
said, the frequency with
which I feel like it is me
and Google rather than me
and my supervisor work-
ing towards a solution is
still unexpected (despite
the fact my undergraduate
degree thankfully pre-
pared me for this).
We’re often warned
of the dangers of a boss
that is too hands on, but
have you ever considered
a boss that is so absent
that he’s often considered
a visitor in his own lab.
I often feel like I see
more days without the
mention of Brexit than
days with the mention of
a lab meeting. And don’t
even get me started on
the things that I seem to
be expected to do outside
of my PhD which often
get communicated via a
three lined email with no
signature. Undergraduate
students materialise with
vague project titles which
resemble something to do
with something I worked
on a while ago and spend
an unnerving amount of
time asking when they’ll
meet the person in charge
(what, you don’t trust
me?!).
is kind and interested in
my work. When present,
he is friendly, approach-
able and willing to share
knowledge. A person who
takes an interest in my
personal life and wellbe-
ing. It is just unfortunate
that without the postdoc-
toral staff leading the way,
mistakes could end up
being detrimental.
There are many people
who have it worse than I
do, and I appreciate that.
It could be worse, and this
independence is teaching
me so many skills I
probably would not learn
otherwise. What I dislike
is that a PhD experience is
often completely dictated
by the “luck of the draw”
that comes with supervi-
sors. We need a system
at Imperial that somehow
smooths over this varia-
bility and addresses the
often-unpredictable be-
haviour that PhD students
have come to expect.

U

PhD research
can be a daunt-
ing experience.
Not only does it challenge
you intellectually, but it
can put a strain on your
mental wellbeing. A study
published last year re-
vealed that one in two PhD
researchers experience
psychological distress,
while one in three is at risk
of a common psychiatric
disorder. Impostor syn-
drome, deadlines, stress,
isolation and myriad
other negative thoughts
or emotions can be over-
whelming. Oftentimes
this can leave us feeling
helpless and stuck. No
one is, nor should be alone
in this.
I myself struggle with
depression and anxiety.
Thankfully, the services
provided through Imperial
College and the Health
Centre have helped me
survive these past few
years. The problem isn’t
gone, but there are ways
to overcome them in times
of elevated stress. Mine
was art, and I think it
could be yours too. There
is plenty of research to
show the positive effects
of art towards mental
wellbeing but I’d like to
share my experience, so I
won’t get into the details.
“‘Do you
have hands?
Excellent.
That’s a good
start. Can
you hold a
pencil? Great.

During my most intense
relapses, I picked up a
pen, drew some random
lines and I never stopped.
It took me a while to
figure out what my style
was until I came across
the Zentangle movement.
It is essentially doodling,
but with the assembly of
structured patterns using
shapes, lines, curves and
dots. There is no planning
and you do not need to
be artistically skilled. All
you need is a pen and
paper. I combined this
method with creating
mandalas – a spiritual
symbol in Hinduism and
Buddhism that represents
the Universe. Filling
up the mandalas with
repeated and connected
patterns helped me focus
on the process and realign
my thoughts. Once the
mandala is completed,
the sense of achievement
brings back positivity and
motivated me to carry on.
There are no limits
to what you can do with
art. I took my mandalas
to the next level when I
entered the ‘Research as
Art’ competition hosted
by the Graduate School
last summer. I combined
my art with my research
and produced The Ripple
Effect. I spent 48 hours
drawing a giant mandala
by hand on an upcycled
table top.
My PhD research
explores interventions
within human behaviours
that can create a ‘ripple
effect’ to improve the

environment. This is rep-
resented within the layers
of the mandala showing
the multiple components
in the agricultural system
and their connections to
the water environment.
This also provided a nar-
rative of the magnitude of
the endeavours involved
to bring safe and clean
drinking water to our taps.
This mandala won me first
place at the competition.
Of course, you don’t
have to go big. Start small,
carry a small notebook
around and a reliable
pen. Take some time to
shut down and draw. Just
let it flow. Experiment
with different media and
don’t worry about making
mistakes. In the words
of Bob Ross, “we don’t
make mistakes, just happy
little accidents.”
