Tartuffe: The Imposter
Jesus Hopped the ‘A’Train
P
opular and
well-received by
the public when
it first showed in
1664, but quickly banned
due to the backlash from
religious groups for the
portrayal of someone
outwardly pious but
truly a sort of lecherous
con artist, Tartuffe was
a masterpiece of satire
on the sham of religion
and its trickster nature.
In this new version, it’s a
thinly-veiled commentary
both on Brexit Britain, and
also the widening gap be-
tween the rich and pretty
much everyone else. In the
past, where the play may
have ended with Orgon
and his family playing the
victim, here we leave with
an indescribable sense
that Tartuffe is a sort of
victim, and Orgon’s
bourgeoise lifestyle and
the allowances that are
made for him because of
his wealth, were more of
a problem that Tartuffe’s
deceptive behaviour.
It just shows how
transferrable the subject
matter is – it really is an
incredible thing that a
play 350 years old can still
feel so incredibly relevant
to today’s socio-politi-
cal issues. From ironic
religious hypocrisy and
deluding the gullible to
the unjust abuse of wealth
and power, Molière’s
work of art has it all.
his skilful portrayal of
the enigmatic charlatan
Tartuffe, a remarkable
balance between charisma
and oddity. With an
obscure, slightly dodgy
Euro-something accent,
bizarre polka dot under-
wear/printed t-shirt outfit
ensemble, and vague
spiritual ramblings, he
somehow manages to
weasel his way into the
family and dupe the man
of the house, Orgon –
even turning him against
his own relatives with
S
et in the high
security wing of
Rikers Island,
Jesus Hopped the
‘A’ Train boldly contrasts
the stories of two inmates
and the circumstances
that led them there. On
one hand, we have new
prisoner Angel Cruz,
played by Ukweli Roach,
who shot a religious cult
leader “in the ass” for
brainwashing his friend
– he’s frightened, con-
fused, and doesn’t really
know where he stands or
what’s going to happen to
him. On the other hand,
there’s veteran inmate
Lucius Jenkins, played by
Oberon K. A. Adjepong, a
serial killer who endures
life on death row by
God-fearing preaching
and unreciprocated phil-
osophical discourse with
sadistic, no-nonsense
guard Valdez.
The dialogue goes from
sharp and witty to deep
debates fluently, and the
men argue about forgive-
ness, faith, redemption,
responsibility, and crime.
The delivery was spot
on, from Adjepong’s
powerful performance as
almost-too-righteous and
aggressively committed
to his cause, to Roach as
superficially cocky but in
reality terrified. There’s
also fine work by both
Joplin Sibtain and Dervla
Kirwan, who play the
archetypal callous warden
and arrogant defence
lawyer respectively.
The set itself, expertly
designed by Magda Willi,
was evocative – a cat-
walk-type stage running
through the middle with
seating on either side,
and perpendicular sliding
glass doors to signify the
divisions between jail
cells. Young Vic plays
are always interestingly
staged, but this design
lent itself particularly well
to the context. Aside from
the ‘jail cells’ and a chair,
there is nothing else – it
is totally bare, with no
clutter, both exposing the
characters symbolically,
and also allowing their
emotion and acting to
do all the talking, so the
audience can really ap-
preciate it. It is interesting
to see when the doors
move together and apart
from each other, they are
representing the compres-
sion and decompression
physically, mirroring the
character arcs. The dense
writing really thrives
here, and as Willi says in
an interview, they didn’t
need much décor to make
it work. The sound design
starts off slightly abrasive,
with the cacophony of
trumpets with lights out
during scene changes,but
you get used to it.
In short, the play is ad-
dressing important ques-
tions of facing up to your
wrongdoings and holding
yourself accountable, and
whether redemption is
ever possible, which I’m
sure everyone can relate
to (just maybe not on a
scale this extreme). There
are no easy answers, and
whilst you won’t leave the
theatre knowing exactly
what the message of the
play was meant to be, it
provides a lot of food for
thought – and really, what
more could you ask for?

Kate Hewitt directs a compelling new version of Pulitzer
prize winner Stephen Adly Guirgis’s dark comedy prison
drama.
“Thinly-veiled
commentary
on Brexit
Britain and
the widening
gap between
the rich and
pretty much
everyone else”
“Molière’s
work of art has
it all”
Relocated to luxurious
modern-day Highgate, in
possibly one of the most
beautiful and opulent set
designs I’ve ever seen,
Donnelly’s version deftly
shows that the moral
issues the play explores
are not a thing of the
past at all. Perhaps what
has made the play such
a staple in the world of
theatre is the universality
of it. Donnelly makes
it even more accessible
for all audiences by
abandoning the original,
perhaps more complicat-
ed, rhymes in favour of
modern-day language to
suit the temporal setting.
This gives us more of
an opportunity to focus
on the comedy and
incredible physicality of
the production, such as
Olivia Williams’s Elmire
leaping around the room
trying to seduce Tartuffe
and expose him whilst her
husband lies hidden on
the sofa. The play has a
slow start (still interesting
though), and the second
scene really takes off, with
fantastic performances
from all the cast.
The real stand-out per-
formance of course comes
from Denis O’Hare, for
“A real
stand-out
performance
from Denis
O’Hare, the
enigmatic
charlatan
Tartuffe”
seemingly little effort.
The play snowballs
from here, with the rest
of the family scrambling
to help the deluded Orgon
see Tartuffe’s lies and
deception. Kitty Archer
confidently plays Orgon’s
daughter who finds herself
being blackmailed into a
marriage, Geoffrey Lumb
as her socialist street-poet
lover Valere, and another
of my favourite perform-
ers of the night, Kathy
Keira Clarke as Dorine,
the shrewd housekeeper
and close friend of the
family, whose description
of Tartuffe as an “edible
fungal growth” had
everyone in stitches (you
had to be there – so go!).
