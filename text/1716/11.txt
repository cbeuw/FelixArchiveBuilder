Ovid’s Metamorphoses
Tacenda
H
ow many
ways can one
make age-old
tales fresh
and exciting? In 80
minutes, international
theatre company Pants
on Fire tells a selection of
stories from Ovid’s epic
Metamorphoses: Jupiter
transforms his mortal
lover Io into a sad cow
in a gas mask, Theseus is
tended to by a gaggle of
giggling nurses in a mil-
itary hospital, Cupid is a
little puppet evacuee who
shoots Apollo and Daphne
across a party while the
gramophone plays in the
background.
Peter Bramley’s pro-
duction transports these
mythological tales to the
setting of the second world
war, with all its associated
military costumes, char-
acters and paraphernalia.
When Eurydice dies and
Orpheus is devastated,
he follows her with his
lyre, charming all in his
way – to the Underworld,
which in this case is
actually the London Un-
derground. The image of
characters emerging from
and descending down the
escalators of the tube was
cleverly done and very
funny.
Indeed, the fantastical
nature of the show relied
on an array of colourful,
ingenious props, and a
creative use of set. Four
whiteboards were moved
around between and
during scenes to create
a changing space, from
the interior of a room
to waves at sea. Props
used were very amusing
– as Ariadne sings of her
loneliness after Theseus
abandons her, cardboard
waves move in unison as
two puppet fish join in the
chorus.
Probably the most
memorable story of the
show was that of Narcis-
sus, who is recast as a Hol-
lywood heartthrob who
falls in love with his own
face on screen. Everyone
in the audience probably
has the image of actor
Max Gallagher on screen
smiling seductively in dif-
ferent angles seared into
their minds. His seductive
acting was so funny that
when he reappeared on
stage later playing the
cello for another story, the
audience laughed at his
very appearance.
It was clear that the
cast was having as much
fun as we were. The seven
actor-musicians move
fluidly between roles in
different stories, equally
adept at playing instru-
ments as singing and
being godly. Lucy Egger’s
original music was fantas-
tic, helping to tie the oth-
erwise disparate stories
together somewhat.
Ovid opened his poem
with the phrase “I intend
to speak of forms changed
into new entities” – and
indeed, the stories pre-
sented in the show empha-
sise the transformations
between man and nature.
Daphne turns into a tree,
Narcissus into a flower,
Io into a cow. Bramley
chose to open his show
with the story of Tiresias,
Apollo’s prophet famed
for his clairvoyance.
Tiresias predicts that
there will be a war in the
future between man and
nature, a theme that came
across as too didactic and
in-your-face by the end
of it. It is an important
theme, and very relevant
today, but the importance
of harmony between
man and nature could be
more subtly dealt with.
The ample opportunities
offered by the stories
of fluid metamorphoses
between man and nature
were not fully harnessed
to bring across the point
in a more elegant way.
Ovid’s Metamorphoses
has received critical
acclaim since its debut
at the Edinburgh Fringe
in 2010 and then off
Broadway in 2011. It cer-
tainly does not disappoint.
W
ould you
watch the
same day
played out
again and again? Lizzie
and Joy are best friends,
but as Joy is crashing
at Lizzie’s flat, they are
getting on each other’s
nerves. Joy is trying to
get bored businessmen
interested in her free sani-
tary pads campaign, while
Lizzie’s music classroom
is about to be turned into
a shiny new computer lab.
The two meet up later to
attend their friend’s 30th
birthday party, taking out
the frustrations of their
day on their friend and
each other.
This same day is
played out multiple times
during this show with
tweaks in their dialogue,
interactions, and therefore
outcome. In one version,
the two hide their respec-
tive bad days from each
other, only to take it out on
strangers at the party later.
In another, Joy is brutal to
Lizzie, saying “You look
shit. No, seriously you
do.” Even Joy’s taxi ride
to the party is played out
in different ways – she
chats about her bad day, or
plugs into her earphones
to avoid any conversation
at all.
It is difficult to un-
derstand the point of the
show from the outset. The
different versions of the
same day don’t follow any
particular progression,
and none result in better
outcomes than any other.
“Tacenda is an archaic
term referring to things
better left unsaid,” reads
the show’s description.
“This is theatre about why
we sugarcoat our words...
Tacenda will force us to
relive our mistakes until
we have the nerve to be
straight with each other.”
If that was the point, it
didn’t come across as
such. None of the sce-
narios had the characters
being more honest than
others, only differing
degrees of nastiness to
each other.
This was precisely what
I thought turned out to be
the message of the play
in the end. That despite
tweaking this and that
choice of words, leading
to a shift in interactions,
and therefore outcome of
the party and their days,
none turns out ‘better’than
another. Whether Joy and
Lizzie were honest with
each other did not change
the fact that someone
would always mess up in
the party after – just in
different ways. Whether
Joy placidly accepted the
manager’s dismissal of
her campaign, or swore
continuously at him, or
played the compassion
card of corporate social re-
sponsibility, her campaign
was not accepted. What
changed was how she felt
about it after.
In the same vein,
whatever Lizzie said, her
music room was going to
be taken away from her at
school. But it was in the
situation where she stood
up to the head teacher that
made her feel better about
it after. In a way, there
was an element of fate in
how the scenarios were
presented – we cannot
change how things turn
out, but we can change
how we approach them.
It was also interesting to
see how minor changes
in what characters say to
each other transform the
atmosphere of a certain
situation. The setting of
contemporary London
and very millennial char-
acters also made it feel
relevant to our mundane
daily lives.
In all honesty, it got
rather tedious by the
fourth scenario, and I was
thinking, do I really have
to watch this again? But
that feeling grew on me
at the end, as it empha-
sised the Sisyphean feel
of getting through our
millennial struggles. Too
close for comfort? Maybe.
