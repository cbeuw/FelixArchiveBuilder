Self-eliminationsandshinysilverforICFencing
V
alentine’s Day:
22 fencers, 6
competitions,
4 Imperial
self-eliminations, 3 days,
and 1 silver medal!
On the evening of
Valentine’s, while most
people were with loved
ones, 9 fencers set off to
Sheffield to show their
love of fencing. They
were attending BUCS
Individuals where univer-
sity fencers compete in an
individual competition to
determine the best fencers
in the country.
The first day of the
competition was Men’s
Epee and Women’s Sabre,
and after winning a bronze
medal last year in the
Epee we had high hopes
this year. After a mixed
set of results in the poules
the first self-elimination
arose - Filip had drawn
Louis in the round of 128.
Filip won the bout 15-8
and proceeded to come
16th overall.
Another self-elimina-
tion was on the horizon as
James (last year’s bronze
medallist) fenced our
strongest epeeist Harry in
the round of 32. The bout
finished 15-8 to Harry
who finished in 6th.
Meanwhile in Women’s
Sabre, Fran (an epeeist by
training), was progressing
very well in her second
weapon, finishing 13th
overall. The remaining
fencers joined everyone
in Sheffield that night
with many enjoying some
excellent competition
preparation with a night
out in Sheffield…
The second day saw
the Women’s Foilists and
Men’s Sabreurs compete.
A tough round of poules
lead to our 3rd self-elim-
ination when Michael
faced Filip in the round
of 128. Filip, possibly still
inebriated, managed to
win the very close match
with a final score of 13-15.
Filip won the next round
as well after a quick nap,
finishing 32nd overall.
Women’s foil had
only two entrants from
Imperial - one unfor-
tunately didn’t make it
past the group stage but
Ailsa, unencumbered by
the thought of having to
fence an Imperial student,
fenced a strong last 32
match before finishing
14th, being knocked out
by the eventual winner.
The third day was our
final chance of medals in
Men’s Foil and Women’s
Epee. During the poules,
Aaron, our best foilist,
only conceded 2 hits
(and scored 25) ranking
2nd going into the direct
elimination round. This
led to the 4th Imperial
self-elimination of the
weekend as Peter ranked
63rd faced Aaron in the
round of 64 - Aaron won
the bout 15-3.
In the Women’s Epee,
both Rocío and Fran got
to the last 16 but were
knocked out in closely
fought matches with
Rocío finishing highest in
10th place.
Back to Men’s Foil
and all other Imperial
fencers were out, meaning
Aaron was our last hope
of a medal. A very close
quarter final bout saw
Aaron come back from
10-13 down to win 15-14,
followed by a more
straight forward semi-final
win, guaranteeing himself
a silver medal. The final
was close fought to start,
but 3 minutes in, Aaron’s
cramp caught up with him
and a brief medical break
was required. He fought
on valiantly but after a
long tough day, gained
second place. losing the
final 15-9.
Despite some unlucky
draws and tough matches,
the fencers should be
proud of their fencing and
their fantastic support and
coaching of each other.
Returning a silver medal
was an excellent end to
the weekend, and a result
to beat next year!
Parries, pancakes and parties in Paris
E
veryyearinParis,
the Challenge
X-Systra – a stu-
dent run fencing
competition organized by
the École Polytechnique
– hosts students from all
over Europe. Those who
love the sport don’t shy
away from a three hour
train, and so, this year
went eighteen Imperial
College Fencing Club
members to Palaiseau,
Paris.
If it was already cold
in London, it had nothing
on the snow-covered
campus in Palaiseau.
Those who love the sport
also don’t shy away from
climbing up a deathly hill
dragging equipment and
suitcases behind, because
ain’t nobody got time (or
money) for an Uber.
On Friday, the individ-
ual events began. After a
long day of pancakes (and
some fencing), the results
were as follows: Women’s
foil - Marie Obrowski
34th, Eshaya Lim 28th;
Men’s foil - Marcel
Buen 38th, Ben Fry 31st;
Women’s epee - Georgie
Stroud 15th, Carolina
Colagrossi 13th; Men’s
epee - Rohan Kamath
50th, Kirill Khraponichev
41st, Zoltan Hanesz 19th;
Women’s sabre - Grace
Collins 19th, Sherry
Xu 6th; Men’s Sabre) -
Nicholas Walker 43rd,
Raymond Wang 30th,
Emre Ozer 28th, David
Dai 22nd, Apostolos Pa-
nagiotopoulos 16th.
On Saturday, the team
events were on. The best
part about team events
were the names of teams:
Imperial Collage, Imperial
Stormtroopers, Caught off
guard, The Three Mous-
tiquaires... The Women
Sabre’s team final saw
Unisport Austria against
Most Likely Toulouse,
including fencers from
Kings and our very own
Sherry Xu.
The two teams fought
valiantly – every time the
board lit up, the audience
would hold their breath,
waiting for the judge’s
ruling. When the right
hand would lift, a roaring
cheer would erupt from
the seats, with many
rooting for Most Likely
Toulouse.
The last bout saw the
points raise to 44–42 for
Most Likely Toulouse.
The excitement in the
room was almost unbear-
able, but Most Likely
Toulouse surprised the
opposition with a last
second retreat and coun-
terattack to win the match!
That night the partying
was strong with the
Imperial fencers, who
celebrated bringing home
a team gold medal by
making the most of the
open bar and fireworks…
