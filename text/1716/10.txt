The Price
I
n Arthur Miller’s
1968 play The Price,
four people quarrel
over the price of
old furniture. Yes, that is
essentially the drama’s
synopsis. Four characters
in a New York attic,
debating the value of
relics of the past, piled
up floor to ceiling –
from ancient dining sets,
chairs, wardrobes, and
old fencing equipment to
an out-of-tune harp. But
don’t be fooled: Jonathan
Church’s 50th
anniversary
production of Miller’s
play is far more than
that. Despite a seemingly
mundane plot, The Price,
starring David Suchet
and Brendan Coyle, is
as absorbing as a thriller.
Visually extravagant and
deeply emotional, it tells
a story about resentment,
the cost of success and
the difficulty of making
peace with the past in
a heavily materialistic
world. As Arthur Miller
put it himself: “The play
is about people who make
decisions in life and the
price they pay for those
decisions”.
The play’s storyline is
deceptively simple. Victor
Franz is a 50-something,
utterly frustrated and
bitterly disappointed
policeman, trying to sell
a houseful of old furniture
piled up in an attic that
was once his childhood
home. Despite once being
a promising scientist, he
dropped out of college to
look after his father ruined
by the Great Depression.
He sees neither meaning
in the past nor hope for his
remaining years. At the
same time, he lacks not
only the courage to retire,
as this would force him
to recognise his failure
to generate anything
worthwhile through
his career, but also the
will to start over. Victor
resents his older, long-es-
tranged brother Walter,
who stayed in college
and enjoys a career as a
successful surgeon. Yet
even Walter fails to find
meaning or significance
to his prosperity and
fame. Over the course of
an afternoon, duplicity
and family secrets are
revealed. Walter, Victor’s
alcoholic wife Esther, and
Gregory Solomon, the 89-
year-old Lithuanian Jew
and antique dealer hired to
appraise their possessions,
force the beat cop to face
a painful and long-stifled
question, namely the
value, or ‘price’ of his
sacrifice.
Both brothers are
magnificently played.
As Victor, Brendan
Coyle – whom you might
recognise from Downton
Abbey as John Bates – im-
personates perfectly the
weariness of a man forced
to acknowledge the point-
less and meaningless fate
from which he will never
break free; a frightening
warning of how rapidly
one might waste their
life. Adrian Lukis also
portrays Walter perfectly
by capturing his fears,
unease and the guilt of
having gotten away. The
whole cast is undoubt-
edly exceptional, but it
is truly David Suchet’s
manipulative, versatile
yet charming portrayal of
Gregory Solomon who
is the play’s icing on the
cake. Although it is in
fact a supporting role,
Suchet’s glowing perfor-
mance turned this comic
and eccentric character
into the star of the entire
show. Suchet played to
perfection a seemingly
harmless 89-year-old with
extreme joie de vivre and
incredible manipulation
skills, but also with a
vulnerable and wise soul.
He was certainly missed
in the second act, where
he spent most of the time
off stage.
Simon Higlett’s set
design was a masterpiece
with massive amounts of
chairs, tables, armoires,
and mirrors stacked up
to the ceiling, giving
the impression that all
actors would eventually
be swallowed up by the
pile of old furniture. Sara
Stewart, playing Victor’s
alcoholic wife Esther,
successfully conveyed the
perilous atmosphere as
well as the stuffy and dis-
comfiting nature of sitting
in a graveyard of objects,
which, although once
loved, are now worthless.
“Time is a terrible thing”:
in this line, Gregory
Salmon truly encapsu-
lates the whole essence of
the play.
On the surface, The
Price is about how much
the antique dealer will pay
for the long-neglected pile
of furniture. But beyond
the obvious, the play ad-
dresses the price involved
in self-sacrifice, the price
we pay for our success
and ambitions – as well
as the cost of dividing
families. Although it is
now 50 years old, the
play’s message is more
relevant than ever in
our current throw-away
society. Miller compels us
to reflect on the dichoto-
my of material wealth and
affluence versus personal
integrity, something
which affects every one
of us, yet something no
one seems to care about.
Finally, the play reminds
us that while we are truly
the authors of our lives,
we must remember that
there is always a cost
attached to our decisions.
Glowing performances, powerful emotions and a wonderful set design result in a priceless production.
