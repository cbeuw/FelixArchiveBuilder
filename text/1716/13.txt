Snæfellsnes Peninsula - Iceland’s hidden gem
TRAVEL

T
he recent
explosive rise
in tourism in
Iceland is noth-
ing short of amazing. In
fact, the Icelandic gov-
ernment is struggling to
control the burgeoning
tourism industry as more
and more curious tourists
make their way to the
lone nation island to find
out what the hype is all
about. While Iceland has
a lot of charming popular
locations scattered around
the island, especially the
south coast, a lot of visi-
tors are still oblivious to
an enchanted region that is
hidden in plain sight, the
Snæfellsnes Peninsula.
Located just north of
and lava caves, the pen-
insula has the most varied
attractions compared
to any other regions in
the country. Because of
its convenient location,
many travel companies
in Iceland offer assorted
tour packages for the pen-
insula, though they have
varying attractions listed.
While you can find
multiple black beach spots
in Iceland, Snæfellsnes’
very own Djúpalónssan-
dur black pebble beach
is truly distinctive as it
is decorated with unique
rock formations from the
lava field near the beach.
As with other black
beaches found in Iceland,
it is also one of the well-
known locations in Icelan-
dic sagas and folklore for
trolls and the Huldufólks,
Iceland’s version of elves.
It is believed that the rock
formations belong to the
bodies of trolls that were
turned into stones when
exposed to sunlight.
When visiting the
Snæfellsnes peninsula,
the breathtaking Snæfells-
jökull will most likely be
in the backdrop through-
out the journey, looming
over the peninsula as if it
commands control over it.
Indeed, the glacier-capped
stratovolcano, located
in the similarly-named
Snæfellsjökull National
Park, serves as the main
attraction of the whole
peninsula. It is primarily
known for being the site
where the protagonists
discovered an entrance
to a passage leading to
the center of the Earth in
“Journey to the Center
of the Earth”, an epic
1864 novel written by
acclaimed novelist Jules
Verne.
Another unmissable
in the blockbuster TV
series, HBO’s Game of
Thrones. Its oddly-shaped
peak jutting out would
certainly turn heads and
the nearby waterfalls
accommodate the scenery
faultlessly for that perfect
Instagram shot.
With so many beauti-
ful sites and landmarks
dotted across the penin-
sula, it is no wonder that
a lot of Icelanders regard
Snæfellsnes as the only
part of their country that
practically has everything
the country can offer.
This, along with the fact
that it is just a 2-hour
drive from the capital,
proves that the peninsula
is the perfect spot for
travellers who are short
on time when visiting the
lovely country.
“Kirkjufell also
holds the title
of the most
photographed
mountain
in Iceland”
“It is often
dubbed as
‘Iceland in
Miniature’
by locals and
travellers
alike”
the capital city Reykjavik,
the peninsula offers an
abundance of natural ge-
ographic landscapes that
are unique to Iceland and
thus, it is often dubbed
as ‘Iceland in Miniature’
by locals and travellers
alike. From volcanoes and
glaciers to black beaches
landmark that can be
found on this peninsula is
located near a small town
called Grundarfjörður.
Known as ‘the church
mountain’, Kirkjufell also
holds the title of the most
photographed mountain in
Iceland and was featured
