volves the introduction

freshly-made right in front

released on Monday 4th
March.
As well as new addi-
tions to the JCR shop,
there will also be some
changes to h-bar. The
h-bar College dinner café
service will be extended
from Monday-Thursday
to Monday-Friday 5-7pm,
ensuring a dinner option
will be available to Post-
graduates, Undergradu-
ates, and staff every night
of the week. This change
is to be implemented on
4th
March, following the
recent announcement
that College Catering
will be stopping its h-bar
evening bar food. The
Union is pushing back on
College on the decision
to cease this service, and
the Deputy President
(Finance & Services) has
requested the finances
in order to scrutinise the
decision. Additionally, the
Union will be conducting
research in the next few
weeks with the postgrad-
uates and staff to identify
what aspects of h-bar are
most important, feedback
on the food and drink, and
how the offering could be
improved to encourage
more people to use the
venue. This data will
strengthen the case the

to work with College to

impact on everyone who
uses the bar, while also not
compromising the long-

campus! With several
departments specifically
highlighting the demand
for pizza amongst their
students and requesting it
be offered, as well as being
one of the most ordered
takeaway foods ordered
on campus according to
survey, it was no surprise
it was the favourite food
option in the Summer
Ball food poll, winning
with 65.9%. The Union
had been working with
College to install a pizza
vending machine for the
past few months, before
the idea was expanded
into a full pizza shop.
Following this, ‘Neo
Pizza’ will be replacing
‘Fuel’ in the JCR, offering
options of slices, whole
pizzas and meal deals. A
whole 12” pizza will cost
£7 for students, subsidised
by College, with staff
price equalling £8.40 and
visitor price being £9.33.
The meal deals will cost
students £3.50, again sub-
sidised by College, and
include a slice of pizza
with a side salad and a
canned drink. Meanwhile,
the salad bar will be re-
locating to the JCR shop

JCR, where you will still
be able to customise your
own salad boxes.

College are working
together to launch a
plant-based café at the
start of Summer Term,
located where College
Café currently is. Taking
inspiration from various
restaurants and cafés
around London on aspects
of menu, flavour, layout
and sustainability, this
café will serve hot and
cold vegan dishes, sand-
wiches, and drinks, along-
side a hydration station of
free naturally flavoured
waters. New dishes for
this outlet are currently
being trialled in the SCR.
If you have a dish you

know by filling out the

reusable Tupperware
will also be available
to purchase at this café,
with bonus Yoyo points
being awarded if you use
this Tupperware or bring
your own, instead of
using a disposable box.
This reinforces Greening
Imperial’s campaign to
raise awareness of our
individual environmental
impact, and also increase
the university’s overall
sustainability.

introduced?
Some changes have
already slowly been
introduced since January.
The SCR has a brand new
salad bar, for which the
demand was recognised
through student and
staff feedback collected
verbally and online, as
well as the SES survey
highlighting the desire for
healthier options. On top
this, popular food items
have also been introduced
on campus. The JCR shop
has added giant sausage
rolls into their hot food
cabinets, and the JCR
Deli now serves hot meat
sandwiches.
The Library Café has
also refreshed its look,
introduced an express
queue for cold foods
following feedback on
speed of service, and
started serving more
freshly cooked food rather
than heating up frozen
items in the oven [photo

to-one mentoring. At
the Final Showcase, five
finalists will pitch to a
panel of expert judges to
win one of three prizes.
The three winners win a
share of the £30,000 prize
fund, that they can use to
kick-start their projects.
The judges, experts in en-
trepreneurship, academ-
ics, and industry, make
their decision based on
each finalist’s five-minute
pitch and five-minute
Q&A session.
WE Innovate is part of
