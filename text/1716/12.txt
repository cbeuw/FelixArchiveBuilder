Ariana Grande’s thank u, next is a mature and
conscientious pop classic
Only half a year after the release of pop landmark Sweetener, Ariana Grande is back, this time reflecting on the
turbulence and tragedy of the preceding months.
I
thoroughly enjoyed
Ariana Grande’s last
album, Sweetener.
With a majority of
the production handled by
Pharrell, the project had
an eccentric and colourful
atmosphere, and was far
more interesting than your
standard pop album. And
it didn’t just sound great;
considering the context of
the release (her first album
released after a terrorist
attack at her Manchester
concert which left 27
people dead), the lyrics
and song topics displayed
surprising strength and
positivity. The release
also took place only a
few months after her
breakup with rapper Mac
Miller, her boyfriend of
two years, over concerns
with his worsening sub-
stance abuse problems.
Considering the turmoil
of the preceding year,
the emotional tone of
Sweetener was celebra-
tory and inspiring; even
the songs about her pain
were made optimistic and
hopeful.
Not only did Sweetener
contain songs demonstrat-
ing a mature and healthy
approach to dealing with
the trauma of the past year,
it also featured a handful
of incredibly gorgeous
and heartfelt love songs
dedicated to her new
fiancé, Pete Davidson.
Her infatuation was clear
in a number of tracks
(including one named
after him), and the potent
mix of lovely production
and moments of lyrical
tenderness (take “my
whole life got me ready
for you” or “I’m tryna
turn two single people
into a couple”) combined
to create a euphoric
atmosphere that showed
that, after a painful year,
everything was promising
to work out.
Tragically, shortly
after the release, things
fell apart. A month later,
Mac Miller died of a
drug overdose - only
four months after their
breakup. Another month
later, Ariana’s engage-
ment was over.
One might have pre-
dicted that there would
be a long wait before
new music was released.
Nobody could have
guessed that, only a month
after the end of her en-
gagement, Ariana would
release a song showcasing
a staggering amount of
strength and maturity.
It really can’t be over-
stated how incredibly
positive and decorous
that song, ‘thank u, next’,
really is. In the track,
she names her previous
partners, thanking them
individually for making
her who she is now.
Going as far as to directly
name Pete and Mac in
the opening lines is both
brave and sad, showcas-
ing impressive emotional
maturity and warmth of
spirit. The song took over
the radio, and I would
argue that a significant
part of the success was
due to the genre-defying
sincerity, honesty and
emotional intelligence of
the song. Many pop songs
are reductive, cynically
produced for mass-appeal;
here is a song that sounds
more like emotional
healing, showcasing
bravery and soul-bearing
rarely heard in the Top 40.
After this, the album
was announced, sur-
prising considering how
recently Sweetener was
released. And it’s even
more surprising that, con-
sidering the short time-
span between releases
and the undeniable trauma
of the past six months,
Ariana has released an
album that is so good.
It understandably feels
more emotionally vulner-
able than Sweetener, with
more songs showcasing
clear heartbreak and pain.
And unlike Sweetener,
where new love provided
the antidote to pain, here
the turmoil is ridden out
alone. Without distraction
and infatuation provid-
ing relief, Ariana finds
comfort in herself, from
within rather than without.
And it is this self-reliance
that makes the album even
more inspiring.
Unlike Sweetener,
where Pharrell’s (unde-
niably fun) production
clashed with the few songs
produced by other artists,
creating a disjointed and
confused overall sound,
the production here is
consistent, and coheres
to paint the picture of a
person going through the
rises and falls in emotion
essentialforhealing.There
are moments of extreme
sadness, followed by a
gradual build in strength
and confidence, and then
again followed by a crash
in spirits. It feels realistic
and cathartic, as if this
accurately reflects the
emotional journey Ariana
has been through.
Where Sweetener
featured a small handful
of unnecessary songs, and
some which were great
but self-contained, with
topics that didn’t contrib-
ute to an overall narrative,
thank u, next contains
no filler, and every song
feeds into the story of a
person navigating through
trauma. In addition to
consistent production
and lyrical content, this
is also the first album
where Ariana is the only
featured vocalist, again
contributing to a cohesive
and consistent sound.
In addition to contain-
ing no unnecessary tracks,
there are a number of
fantastic ones. ‘imagine’
is a gorgeous and wistful
album opener, ‘fake smile’
has jaw dropping bridges
and choruses, ‘ghostin’ is
the heart-breaking emo-
tional nadir of the album,
‘in my head’ is somehow
both crushingly sad and
hopeful. And that’s not
even mentioning the
excellent singles released
to promote the album; the
inescapable title track, ‘7
rings’ and ‘break up with
your boyfriend’ are all
great, with the latter pro-
viding a light-hearted end
to the album. The only
song I personally think
falters is ‘bloodline’, and
even so my main issue is
with the cheap-sounding
horns; other than that
it’s another great song
that contributes to the
narrative of the album,
and would be missed if
deleted.
Sweetener was a great
album with a number
of fantastic songs but a
slightly confused message
and sound. thank u, next
takes death and heartbreak
and creates art, an album
chronicling emotional
turmoil and ascension
from despair to a place of
stoicism and sanity, in a
similar vein to Beyoncé’s
excellent Lemonade.
Ariana takes extreme
pain and transfigures it
into something beautiful,
complex and worthwhile.
