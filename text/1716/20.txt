Land of Hope and Glory
O
n Tuesday,
VegSocs from
Imperial, LSE,
Kings and
Middlesex University
collaborated to host a
film screening of “Land
of Hope and Glory”,
followed by a talk by the
producer, Ed Winters.
Ed Winters, also known
as “Earthling Ed” is one
of the most well-known
faces of UK vegan activ-
ism, and has been featured
in numerous other vegan
documentaries. The
documentary is one of
the multiple efforts to
expose the cruelty behind
the animal agriculture
industry.
During the short but
dense 45 minutes of the
screening, many students
were taken behind the
scenes of intensive
farming units. The images
shown were graphic.
portraying the reality of
intensive farming: abused,
diseased and suffering
animals. In addition,
the deep, grievous tone
of Ed’s narrative that
accompanied these videos
further intensified the
atmosphere in the room.
Anyone who had bore
witness to those footages
could no longer leave the
room and simply say ‘I
didn’t know’, because
we did, and it was almost
impossible to pretend that
none of the cruelty was
happening. The film is
available to view for free
on YouTube via Earthing
Ed’s channel.
Greening Imperial Week 2019
L
ast year, Imperial
was placed
141st out of 154
universities in
the “People and Planet
University League”.
This league table ranks
universities based on
environmental and eth-
ical performance. It is
saddening that we have
such poor reputation on
environmental and ethical
stances.
Greening Imperial is
an initiative to turn this
around. It is a collabora-
tive project between staff,
students and Imperial
College Union (ICU)
which aims to encourage
our college to improve its
environmental and ethical
performance.
Our long-term goal
is to transform Imperial
into a university that is
respected also for its sus-
tainability.
Dr Neil Jennings, a
member of the Greening
Imperial Steering Group
and a Partnership De-
velopment Manager at
the Grantham Institute,
points out that “Greening
Imperial has brought
about a number of positive
changes over the last few
months such as the coffee
cup levy and the ban on
single-use plastic cups.”
But he has acknowledged
that “there is still a lot
more to be done and this
will only be possible if
staff and students continue
to work together to push
for further improvements
in the environmental
and ethical impact of
the College. Greening
Imperial Week, led by
ICU, is a great way to
bring people together
to celebrate success and
discuss ideas for future
improvements.”
In order to celebrate our
achievements, Greening
Imperial will be hosting
‘Greening Imperial
Week’, which starts on the
4th of March. The Student
Union, Ethos Gym, and
Greening Imperial will
be providing you with a
week of events to share
our accomplishments this
year, whilst also raising
awareness on how our
lifestyle impacts the
planet.
Our project is inspired
by the UN Sustainable
Development Goals.
These are global goals
and targets set for 2030 to
achieve a better and more
sustainable future. The
you’re looking for some
tips on where to cycle in
London, where to buy a
bike or simply want to get
your bike up to scratch,
then come to our events
on Monday. You can
also get involved in our
watt bike competition on
Monday to get a chance
to win a Fitness Tracker
or complete our quiz and
stand a chance to win a
prize (https://imperial.

A light-hearted guide to this fun series of events
”Tasty and veggie
Tuesday”
There is scientific
evidence that eating too
much red meat is environ-
mentally damaging and
poor for health. This day
is dedicated to inspiring
more students to eat veg-
etables more, and reduce
the amount of meat con-
sumption throughout the
week.
“Waste less
Wednesday”
Are you used to buying
vegetables and fruits
in plastic packaging?
Grabbing an unrecyclable
coffee cup to go? Have a
go at being waste free this
Wednesday by avoiding
items such as plastic water
bottles. We’ll be selling
reusable water bottles and
telling you all about the
sweet deals on campus
this year for coffee and
lunches when you bring in
your own reusable coffee
cup or tupperware.
“Trendy Thursday”
We’ve partnered up
with Fashion Revolution
to bring you a sustainable
‘Clothes Swap’. For those
wanting to refresh their
wardrobe, this event is
perfect: for every item you
bring in, you get to pick
one out for FREE. On top
of this, Honest Clothing
will also be launching
their digital clothes swap
platform at Imperial. If
you’re looking for a new
top, you can simply check
the Facebook group and
you may find someone
giving away exactly what
you want. Then simply
swap on campus and
voila!
“Forget me not
Friday”
To wrap up the week,
Greening Imperial will
be setting up stalls to
share their initiatives and
provide opportunities for
everyone to get involved.
If you would like to be a
part of the sustainability
movement at Imperial
be sure to visit the stalls
between 12:00 and 14:00
in the JCR and SCR!
We’ll also be having
an Imperial start-up
hosting a Sustainability
Writers Workshop titled
“Creating a sustainable
future facilitated by a
knowledge hub”.
We hope that by the
end of the week everyone
will feel more inspired
and empowered to live a
sustainable lifestyle.

overarching goals that
are relevant to Greening
Imperial week include
climate action and pro-
tecting life on land and
water (SDG 13,14,15).
Each day will have
a theme, ranging from
fashion to cycling, with
events for all to partic-
ipate. Here’s a quick
overview of what will be
on throughout the week:
“Move more Monday”
It’s easy to be a
couch-potato but taking
public transport in London
is mad money. Move more
Monday will encourage
you to get outside and
reduce the use of public
transport (the tube can get
stuffy and busy anyways).
This way, not only are
you reducing the capital’s
emissions but you’re also
boosting your fitness. If
The film screening of a vegan documentary gives a graphic but true look inside the British animal agricultural
industry
One question that I
thought reflected the
complexity in making
veganism mainstream,
was whether vegan/
vegetarian people should
be purchasing the vegan/
vegetarian options at
chains such as McDon-
alds. These fast-food
restaurants are unlikely
to have ethical sourcing
at the top of their priority,
and purchasing from them
could feed in to their
business which thrives
off of intensive agricul-
tural farming. However, if
there isn’t enough demand
for these products, they

ISSUE 1716
FELIX
What I personally
found even more com-
pelling, however, was
Ed’s talk that followed.
Although I initially had
the impression that he
might expound his views
on veganism, he actually
began the talk by frankly
admitting that he, not only
ate but, loved meat during
the first 21 years of his
life. He talked about his
frequent trips to Domino’s
and KFC. This was unex-
pected, and I’m sure some
of the non-vegan students
that attended the event
felt more relatable to him.
By introducing himself as
someone who, like many,
simply didn’t know the
cruelty of animal farming,
Ed instantly caught the
attention of the whole
room. This was then
followed by his journey
into veganism and his new
profound sense of needing
to change.
What I personally really
loved about his talk was
that from the beginning he
made it clear that his aim
was not to make us all go
vegan, but rather, to just
get us to look at the reality
and ask ourselves ques- These pigs look just about as happy as the Sustainability copy editors // livekindly
tions. Why have we arbi-
trarily decided that some
animals like dogs and cats
should be adored pets, but
cows and pigs are for us to
consume? Tradition and
cultures aren’t necessarily
ethical or just – slavery
and female genital muti-
lation are cultures in some
places. What gives us
the right to say that these
animals exist just to serve
humans? Just because we
don’t see the killing, does
that mean we can pretend
it doesn’t exist? What
matters more, satisfying
our palates or the life of
an individual? How can
there be a humane way
to kill if all organisms
strive to live? These are
just some of the prompts
that he raised during the
evening. It was non-con-
frontational. Just thought
provoking.
“How can
there be a
humane way
to kill if all
organisms
strive to live?”
will stop selling them,
which consequently gives
off the impression to the
mainstream that being
vegan/vegetarian is still
not a societal norm. In
response to this question,
Ed explained that pur-
chasing these products
from chains as McDon-
alds may be a necessary
‘stepping stone’ in putting
veganism out there. If big
companies could take on
veganism, it could have
a more profound impact
on society as opposed to a
specialised, niche market
that only vegan people
would purchase from.
As the amount of
meat consumption has
increased rapidly in the
last few decades, it seems
necessary for us to take a
step back and look at how
this has impacted the lives
of billions of animals.
Telling someone to go
vegan is most often not an
effective or compassion-
ate approach. But on this
night, I truly felt the power
of simply witnessing and
questioning as a means
of getting people to shift
their own perspective.
