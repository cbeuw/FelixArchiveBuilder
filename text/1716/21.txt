Buffet has
described
them as
“financial weapons of
mass destruction”. Robert
Kiyosaki said that the sub-
prime Morgage Backed
Security (MBS) disaster
was a result of them
“exploding in financial
institutions such as AIG
and Lehman Brothers”.
So, what exactly are
derivatives?
A derivative is a
financial security with a
value that is dependent
or derived from an
underlying group of
assets. The derivative
itself is a contract between
two ore more parties with
its price determined by
the fluctuations of the
underlying asset. The
underlying asset can be
anything from stocks,
bonds and commodities
to even interest rates
and market indexes.
Most derivatives are
traded over-the-counter
(OTC), since they are
mostly unique and
unstandardized. However,
some standardised
derivatives feature on
exchanges, but they
are more regulated.
Essentially, they were
created as a means of
hedging risk (reduce risk
faced by organisations
and individuals). There
are two main derivative
types used in the financial
industry; futures and
options. Futures are
financial contracts
obligating the buyer
to purchase an asset
or the seller to sell an
asset, most commonly a
physical commodity or
financial instrument, at a
predetermined future date
and price. Options are
sold by an option writer
method may involve
a high degree of risk
and usually have short
holding periods, it is
often more attractive
than the underlying asset
because the contracts
can be highly geared. Put
simply, this means that a
small expenditure gives
the holder a big exposure
to the market. This leads
the investor with the
potential for large profits
but also large losses. It
is this speculation that
dominates criticism of
the derivatives market.
Before the financial
crash of 2008, the Credit
Default Swap (a special
type of derivative) market
was over 20 times larger
than the market for the
underlying security,
Mortgage Backed
Securities.There have also
been numerous occasions
in which derivatives have
been used to gamble on
bankrupt companies.
Akshay Shah, previous
managing director at the
Blackstone’s GSO hedge
fund unit, terrorised
European credit markets
by spearheading a series
of unconventional trades
using derivatives. His
secret formula involved:
GSO buying a Credit
DefaultSwapcontractona
struggling company from
another hedge fund. The
CDS is like an insurance
contract: it pays out if the
company defaults
GSO then approaches
the company and offers it
very attractive financing
(a low interest loan for
example) with an unusual
condition: it must default
in a way that will trigger
a pay-out on the CDS
contract.
The company carries
out this proposal, for
example by paying
interest on a bond a few
days late, causing little
concern to bondholders
but “triggering” the CDS
contracts.
The hedge fund then
has to pay a lump sum to
GSO given the company
has defaulted.
Despite the negative
to an option buyer. They
are typically purchased
through brokers. The
contract offers the buyer
the right, but not the
obligation to buy (call
option) or sell (put option)
the underlying asset at an
agreed future price during
a certain period of time or
on a specific date. There
are many different types
of option from lookback
option, which is path
dependent option where
the option owner has
the right to buy or sell at
the lowest price over a
period, to a binary option,
in which the contract pays
a fixed amount or nothing
at all. The type of option
used wholly depends
on the needs of the two
parties.
Most derivatives are
used to hedge risk. The
contracts can guard
investors against adverse
price movements. A
hedger seeks to protect
a position in the sport
market by taking an
opposite position in
the derivatives market.
However, derivatives can
be used for speculation.
Speculators take a view
on the market’s direction
and seek to make a profit
from price movements by
buying or selling futures
contracts. Although this

aspect of this type of
financial product, they are
still a key lubricant in the
global financial industry.
Recently the UK and US
market regulators have
finalised a sweeping long-
term agreement to jointly
oversee each other’s
derivatives market,
providing a “bridge over
Brexit” that removes
concern of turmoil in the
event of a no deal Brexit.
The deal will mitigate any
risk of huge disruption to
banks and institutional
investors who are
dependent on derivative
contracts to hedge against
movements in interest
rates, currencies and
commodities.
