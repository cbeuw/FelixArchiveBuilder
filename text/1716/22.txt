A
s LGBT+
History Month
draws to a
close, IQ
(Imperial College LGBT+
Society) is looking back
on a successful month of
inclusive and inspiring
events. From film nights
and quizzes, to bar nights
and art exhibits, we’ve
spent this month bring-
ing Imperial’s LGBT+
community together to
celebrate the accomplish-
ments and reflect on the
struggles of those who
have come before us.
We’ve had a busy
month, kicking off with
a Bar Night at South
London’s oldest surviving
gay venue, the Royal
Vauxhall Tavern. With
drag acts, stand-up comics
and many other talents
on display, it was a great
night for all who attended.
Our members attended
screenings of two films
shining a spotlight on
queer relationships, The
Favourite and Disobedi-
ence, hosted by Imperial
Cinema, and visited “The
Oscar Wilde Temple”
at Studio Voltaire, an
ambitious and immersive
exhibition celebrating one
of the earliest forebears
of gay liberation. The ex-
ploration of queer art and
expression was continued
in an Arts and Crafts
event co-hosted by IQ
and Leonardo Fine Arts
Society.
We liaised with the
Careers Service to hold
the inaugural LGBT+
Careers Event, a hugely
successful event that
connected students with
L G B T + - s u p p o r t i n g
employers, followed by
some of our members
attending a panel hosted
by the IC Investment
Society, featuring senior
professionals discussing
their outstanding work to
improve the inclusiveness
of their workplaces for
LGBT+ people.
LGBT+ History Month
culminated with National
Student Pride, an annual
celebration of the young
LGBT+ community at
universities from across
the UK, and the world.
With three days of parties,
debates, recruitment fairs
and exhibitions, it’s the
largest celebration of
LGBT+ youth in the UK,
with over 1700 students
travelling to London to
take part in the festiv-
ities. This year was no
exception, and it was a
great weekend for all the
Imperial students who got
involved.
Alongside LGBT+
History Month, February
has also been Black
History Month in the US.
To celebrate this, we’ve
adopted the redesigned
pride flags introduced by
the “More Color More
Pride” campaign. These
new flags, first raised in
Philadelphia in 2017,
introduce black and
brown stripes to the iconic
rainbow flag. These two
simple stripes aim to ac-
knowledge and celebrate
the role of people of colour
in the LGBT+ community,
who have too often been
marginalised, ignored and
intentionally excluded.
We’re also planning on
changing our logo to not
only better reflect our
identity as Imperial’s
LGBT+ Society, but also
to ensure that our logo
represents every member
of the LGBT+ community
at Imperial, regardless of
race, sexual orientation or
gender identity.
Our community has
made such incredible
progress over the years,
but there is still more
to do. IQ will continue
supporting the LGBT+
community at Imperial
and throughout London,
welcoming truly everyone
into our society. We’ll
keep running events,
raising awareness, and
fighting to make Imperial
a more inclusive place.
There’s never been a
better time to get involved
with IQ and the LGBT+
Society, so we hope to see
you all soon!
An update from
our LGBT+ Officer!
I
mperial has three main avenues of LGBT+
representation: IQ: Imperial College LGBT+
Society, Imperial 600 (Imperial’s LGBT+
staff network) and the Union Liberation &
Community LGBT+ Officer. Having a society, a
staff network and an officer can be both a strength
and a hindrance; it is always beneficial to have
more people advocating for queer issues, but it
can be confusing for students seeking support.
As such, integration of LGBT+ voices across the
college was a significant priority this year.
When I was elected LGBT+ Officer, as well as
IQ President and Trans & Gender Variant Officer,
it marked the first year of unified representation
for Imperial’s LGBT+ students. In my various
roles, I have managed to further develop several
initiatives. First, for the upcoming elections, I am
working with the Union Elections team to include
a statement whereby students can self-select
to vote for Liberation & Community Officers.
This will not disenfranchise any students, nor
collect demographic data but, instead, allow the
L&C Officers to be more representative of their
respective communities. Students will be asked to
only vote for L&C roles that represent them. I am
also working with the IQ committee to ensure the
Union LGBT+ Officer is involved with IQ in a
more overt way. In previous years, there has, at
times, been a complete disconnect between the
two entities. In addition, Imperial 600 has worked
with IQ and myself this month for LGBT+ History
Month events, thus furthering LGBT+ collabora-
tion and unity on campus. Lastly, as IQ Trans and
Gender Variant Officer for the second year in a
row, I have been working on getting a fund set
up for trans students to assist them with buying
transition related items that aren’t covered by the
NHS. This is currently in the works and should be
announced in another Felix article shortly!
Finally, if you feel excited to show your pride
or your support for the LGBT+ community at
Imperial, drop by the Union Reception to pick up
a rainbow lanyard and ICU trans and pride flag
stickers. A limited number of pronoun badges
will also be available while supplies last (they/
she/he, others upon request). Also remember that
you don’t need a PhD for a gender-neutral title
-- StudentHub will happily change your ID card
by removing the title or changing it to Mx if you’d
like. If you have any questions about LGBT life
at Imperial, drop me a line at jd4914@ic.ac.uk or
come to one of the upcoming IQ: Imperial College
LGBT+ events!
