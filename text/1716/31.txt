Royal School of Mines bring back the bottle
F
ollowing last
year’s away loss
to CSM, the stage
was set for the
RSM rugby boys to put in
a huge performance. With
the glorious sunshine in
the hands of RSM, the
team looked strong from
the off.
RSM kicked off well
while CSM were being
dazzled by the Harlington
sun.Aknock-on from kick
off allowed RSM to start
the game strong during
the CSM half. A solid,
well-worked set piece
move from the backs of
RSM, followed by some
dominant carries from the
forward pack, set the tone
of the first half. The RSM
boys consistently broke
the game line, and the
backs committed CSM to
some hard lines - and out
the back plays.
After a solid 10 minutes
in the CSM half, a try
was deservedly scored by
RSM. Parker leaped over
score to 7-0. Short exits
from the CSM half-backs
allowed for RSM to
continue their plays in the
CSM half. The success
of RSM’s structured play
lead to a strong carry
from Hallett, resulting in
another RSM try out near
the touch line. The two
sides then had the chance
to regroup at half time
with a score of 12-0.
The game then took
a turn at the start of the
second half. CSM kicked-
off, the ball was deep into
the RSM twenty-two. As
RSM missed a chance to
exit and after conceding
two penalties on their own
try line, CSM took their
chance and worked their
way over the line. An
unsuccessful conversion
took the score to 12-5.
RSM then took their
foot slightly off the pedal,
giving way for some
potential CSM plays to
be made. Although, solid
commitment from both
defensive lines allowed
for play to be made
