2 R OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
'Vote rigging' at St
Mary's delays count
. A meeting of the Imperial College
U n i o n Executive ( I C U Exec)
yesterday decided to postpone vote
counting in the Imperial College
U n i o n Elections f o l l o w i n g
allegations that the St Mary's Union
Executive attempted to unfairly
influencs the result of the election.
The allegations will be brought
before the Union General Meeting
(UGM) at IC o n Thursday when
students will be asked to decide
whether the votes cast by St Mary's
should be disallowed.
The move follows the discovery of
a poster at St Mary's - labelled with
the official Union emblem - asking
students to vote for A n d r e w
M e r e d i t h for President, Dave
Williams for Honorary Secretary
and Dave Smedley for FELIX Editor.
(Mr Williams is actually standing for
Deputy President).
St M a r y ' s U n i o n Secretary,
Graham Price, who admitted he had
put up the poster told FELIX that he
was acting as an individual and not
on behalf of St Mary's Union. This
is disputed by six St Mary's students
contacted separate-ly by FELIX
yesterday w h o claimed that they
had been advised how to vote at a
Union meeting.
The student responsible for
manning the ballot box at S M H M S
on Monday told FELIX that a
number of students had taken their
ballot papers way in order to
ascertain "the manner in which they
were supposed to v o t e " a n d
returned them subsequently.
The poster was reported to the
I C U Elections Committee last
Monday by Robin Davison who is
standing for the post of FELIX
Editor. The Committee found the St
M a r y ' s Exec to have 'acted
irresponsibly and in a manner likely
to prejudice the outcome of the
election' and subsequently decided
to discount the votes from St
Mary's.
The decision was challenged by
Andrew Meredith, a candidate for
President proposed by S M H M S U
President, Phil Drew. Although the
decision was upheld by a meeting
of the IC Union Executive, M r
Meredith decided to exercise his
right to bring the matter before a
U G M . Speaking from St Mary's he
commented 'It's a complete travesty
of democracy. I do not feel the
poster affected the voting.'
Graham Price told FELIX that he
had not been informed of the rules
of the voting procedure.He added
that as St Mary's is not as yet a
Constituent College of Imperial it is
not answerable to IC election
rules.In response, Ian Morris told
FELIX that by 'similar argument' IC
were within their rights to discount
the St Mary's votes.Phil Drew said
that he was unhappy that St Mary's
Union were not consulted before the
IC Exec decision and said that it
would have serious effects o n the
merger negotiations.
IC Returning Officer, Ian Morris,
told Felix that he felt the poster was
'the provable tip of the iceberg.' He
added that he felt confident that
Thursday's Union General Meeting
would uphold the IC Exec decision.
Legionnaires out
break at IC
A case of Legionnaires disease in
College was confirmed on Friday by
the College Secretary, John Smith.
Water based c o o l i n g towers
throughout the College and the
Science M u s e u m have been shut
d o w n since the weekend as a
precaution.
A telecomunications engineer on
the College staff was admitted to St
Mary's Hospital two weeks ago, but
the disease was not confirmed until
last Friday. A security guard from
the Science Museum was admitted
on the same day and is exhibiting
symptoms of the disease. H e has
been in isolation since February
17th.
In the statement confirming the
the outbreak, M r Smith stressed that
no evidence has been yet found of
the presence of the bacteria within
College. He also stated that 'person-
to-person infection is unknown'.
All recent outbreaks of the disease
have been associated w i t h
ventilation cooling towers similar to
those used by College.
The incubation period for the
illness is 2-10 days and the College
Health Service Director has advised
all students and staff suffering any
of the symptoms, which include
chest pains on breathing, high fever
or nausea, to take them seriously.
0 Editorial
The Union were right in their
decision to disallow the votes from
St Mary's. The Medical School
Union acted unfairly and blatently
whey they tried to get persuade the
voters at St Mary's to vote for their
adopted candidates.
The explanation proferred by the
Union Secretary, that he was acting
as an individual when he put up a
notice indicating the way St Mary's
should vote, just does not wash
when the notice was written on
Official Union notepaper.
Nor can the claims by students
from St Mary's that they were
advised how to vote be brushed
aside.
The irony of the situation is that
many of the Students at St Marys
are not particulary interested in
Imperial or its elections.
Nevertheless, given the large
number of candidates this year,
even a few votes from St Mary's
could make the difference between
success or failure.
No doubt Mr Merredith who was
depending so heavily St Mary's for
his votes will be trying to rally the
medics to attend the UGM on
Thursday.
St Mary's will no doubt argue
that it is a breach of democracy to
take away their right to vote.
But the UGM should not forget
that it is a far greater breach of
democracy to cheat in an election.
If ICU has the decency to allow
St Mary's the privilige of voting in
our elections, the least we can
expect them to do is to play it by the
rules.
C r e d i t s . W h o e v e r thought of
bringing out a flysheet deserves
shooting. M a n y thanks to the
valiant staff who have stayed up all
night; Rob, L i z , Sez, Andy and
Rupert, and to all the people who
worked on FELIX today. I love you
all and 1 want to have your babies
