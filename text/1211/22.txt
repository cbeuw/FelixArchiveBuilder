Singles

Goldfrapp - Utopia Genetically
Enriched (Mute)
This is rich, a s to the warm voice of Alison
Goldfrapp are added several layers of synths
and violins. T h e soprano backing v o c a l s in
response of male choirs are amazing, but this
track isn't a s strong and stirring a s the first
single Human.
Neil Finn - Last to Know
(Parlophone)
A n a c o u s t i c guitar a n d a nice v o i c e - that
makes a gentle song. It's inoffensive and for-
tunately short enough not to make this poor
melody boring. Neil Finn has done better with
his previous single.

Faithless - We Come One
(Cheeky)
I guess it's a good club hit, one of these that
will make you move and dance until dawn. I
still believe though (old fashioned, I know)
that this kind of rhythm is boring at home, so
where's the point in buying it?
Manifesto - JBN: All I Want
(Underdog)
Same style as above, but these dance beats
are uninspired a n d bloody a n n o y i n g , even
after a few drinks, and the aggressive design
of the sleeve doesn't help. But it includes a
full video...

Dina Carroll - Someone Like
You (Mercury)
Maybe you can offer this single to your 10-
y e a r - o l d s i s t e r w h o h a s a l r e a d y all t h e
Whitney Houston discography. If you don't
have that kind of sister, don't think about it
anymore.

C u t e slice of Rn'B pop trifle. These "3 little
women" (how patronising is that?) do a nice
line in ditzy pop with a side helping of street
cred. This song isn't too bad, and the girls put
on a great performance.

Spacek - How do I move?
(Island)
This piece of calm R n ' B is prefect to chillout
after the beat hammering club.
Downtempo and soft vocals reign for a real
treat; this makes a change from all commer-
cial rubbish R n ' B you can hear on the radio.
Even if it's not really my taste, I definitely
enjoyed it.

Limp Bizkit - My Way

I
A l t h o u g h y o u all probably know about thii
band, I've got to review their new single, whicH
is utterly crap. The climax of fat, heavy, u n i n
spired, skate-punk as ugly as Fred Durst pic
face. Let's face it, he cannot even rap, ju s i
sqeal his miserable lyrics. I'm only interestec
why the hell he always put his hands on his will)
when dancing.
Witness - You are all my owrj
invention
Is this the words of a desesperate fan or a lone
ly l o v e r ? T h e s o n g doesn't sound grim, bui
rather lively and optimistic, in a kind of REM
Automatic for the people period vocals anc
melodic style. Perfect to listen on the road for
the beach, or maybe you can find a more funky
Jinrai - Someplace else
Jazzy sirocco that warms up the mood, the jaz
touch remains soft, a flut and strings spice upj
the sound. Dominating vocals, reminding me o i
Jamiroquai, make all the song. Pretty nice tdj
listen to, m a y not be jazz avant garde (o
maybe as I'm far from being an expert), some!
s o u l - R n B influences, deadly effective for aj
lounge flavour.
