The exams are finished. The projects are handed in. The
drains smell and there are lots of virtually naked people in
Hyde Park. Yes, it is Summer, and yes, this is our last issue.
This does of course mean that this is also the last crossword
you'll get from me for a while, but I hope that what I have pro-
vided will last you at least the trip home. It should do so long
as you don't live outside Zone 2. It has occasionally been said
that what I write here doesn't always make much sense - it
seems a bit harsh as it always makes perfect sense to me.
However, bearing this in mind, I have even more space for
nonsense than usual, so hold onto your sanity if you find it a
difficult trip - it'll all be over in three pages' time.
T h e L i t t l e O n e
A b o v e is the crossword I had prepared for last week's issue,
but this was unfortunately cancelled due to the weather being
far too nice and everyone going to the beach instead - don't
accept the Editor's phoney 'money excuse'. I wouldn't wish to
see a crossword wasted, so I have scrounged an extra page
from the Editor to bring it to you this week instead. It has the
unoriginal title of 1211 A , though I refer to it affectionately as
Marmaduke. The answers to M a r m a d u k e here may well be
published next year if anyone still cares by then, but I'm equal-
ly likely to simply forget. Still, I wouldn't lose any sleep over
it.
