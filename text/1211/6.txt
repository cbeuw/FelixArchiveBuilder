A VISION for the future- an impression of the Rector's state of the art new
management suite, made possible by his donation to the College from
Glaxosmithkline. The new office oversees the main entrance to College,
allowing all undesirables and speaker salesmen to be silenced discreetly upon
trying to enter the College. It also allows for the partial obliteration of the
Mines Building, continuing a project which dates back to the late 1950s.
The building was designed by M'lud Foster & Partners, who also designed
That Wobbly Bridge Across The Thames, That Stadium We Can't Afford and
the B M S . Lord Foster is expected to sell the cigarette packet he scribbled it
on to the College for an extra £lm.
Meanwhile, Lord Foster is also in the process of designing an open air car-
park in Dalby Court. Estates are in the process of spending £140,000 on trees
as part of a scheme to transform the area.

T H E C O L L E G E has announced its four new principles, the confirmation of
which will be crucial to its future.
They are: Professor M o Money (Glaxo-Smithkline, formerly of ICSM), Lord
Steel N . Glass (formerly of Foster and Partners), Dr R. U . Belt-Tightening
(from the private sector) and M r Lucrative Overseas-Fees (from the
Management School).
The Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, also announced that he will be working very
closely with the four new principles. Speaking to a selection of high-profile
alumni and royalty at last week's commemoration of the Royal School of
Mines' second anniversary, Sir Richard said, "These are pre-eminent princi-
ples which are respected internationally in work in science, engineering and
medicine... and are the ideal leaders to help the College evolve in this direc-
tion."
Sir Richard's speech was the highlight of a weekend's celebrations to com-
memorate the second anniversary of the R S M . Entitled Undermining History,
a packed crowd in the Bill H . Gates Department of Physics No.4 (UK) heard
tales from veteran students about the College's bygone days, when subjects as
obscure as Geology, Materials and Mathematics were widely taught and con-
sidered vital for the future of the country.
