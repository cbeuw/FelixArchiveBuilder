The Felix Crossword 1211 B by Wailer Ned
T h e B i g O n e
I did, of course, have a big plan for you at the
end of the year, and despite having a spare
crossword, I selflessly pressed on with my
task, formulating the eighty clues required
and losing significant amounts of hair. You
may eventually decide it wasn't worth it, but
I'm not going to be here for you to tell me, so
I'm not overly concerned. The result is the
quadrilateral behemoth found above, and
the clues are placed somewhat convention-
ally to the right. G o o d luck - it should be
pretty easy, but may take a while if you don't
know all the answers.
C r o s s w o r d s P a s t
First the result of 1 209's crossword, where I
am sorry to report that I made a mistake. I
would normally give you another week, how-
ever, some completed it regardless (pointing
out the mistake of course) and there is now
too little of term left. Therefore, A m y
E l l i o t t of C h e m Eng III wins 1209's prize of
a £10 book token. Please try to pry it from
the hands of our editor as soon as you can...
bring a crowbar.
Next to 1210, for which did receive a poten-
tially correct entry but the editor lost it due
to a freak accident including a chair and one
of the Felix computers. S o , if you did bring in
a correct answer, come and make an empas-
sioned plea to the Editor for your prize.
The answers to both 1209 and 1210 are at
the end of this interminable drivel, if you can
be bothered to read that far.
T h a n k y o u
It simply wouldn't be a final issue of Felix
without a huge list of thanks to those who
made it all possible... I will try to avoid doing
a Paltrow. Special thanks go to Dr Hot
Fudge who produced many a great cross-
word, giving you all welcome relief from my
efforts. Not only over-sexed, but over your
nearest ice-cream dessert too. Unfortunate-
