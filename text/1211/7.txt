New York.
NYPD officials say it is too soon to tell
ictly what caused M r Pollard's death, but
ewitness r e p o r t s s u g g e s t t h a t t h e D P
iparently "disappeared up his own arse."
One eyewitness said, "I was walking along
Ith Avenue when I saw an English guy look-
rj really lost. He w a s w a l k i n g a l o n g the
«ement with no idea where he w a s , and
snple were bumping into him. That's when I
|)lised that he couldn't actually s e e what
* going on around him because he had his
«d inserted into his own rectum."
Mr Pollard is b e l i e v e d to have s u f f e r e d
m the rare condition, known as PortiIlaxis
ce having started at Imperial College three
srs ago. Despite its disabling effects, He
s still able to complete two years of an ISE
jree and last February w a s convincingly
icted D e p u t y P r e s i d e n t ( F i n a n c e a n d
[vices). At the time, most of College were
ware that he suffered from the rare condi-
|n, but his repeated a t t a c k s , which could
last up to a week, soon made it
evident that something was seri-
ously wrong.
Individuals with Portillaxis are
capable of living well into old age,

Portillaxis. which he blames for his
involvement in the railways, while
Noel Edmonds is believed to have
suffered a fatal attack six months
ago.
It is believed that during a serious attack of
Portillaxis, the sufferer is unable to extract
their head, which is gradually sucked deeper
in until the individual literally disappears up
their own arse. M a n y secretly suspect that
his spell as D P (F&S) was responsible for the
flaring up of his unfortunate condition.

C o l l e g e , with P r e s i d e n t H a m i s h C o m m o n
describing him as "sweet, industrious and a
good deputy".
Felix Editor John Clifford said "It is unfor-
tunate that M r Pollard should disappear up
his own arse so close to the end of the term.
He will be sorely missed- but his death should
serve as a warning to others about the dan-
gers of this condition."
M r Pollard was 21 when he disappeared.

Ari Darzi, a surgeon at St M a r y ' s hospital,
has successfully demonstrated a robotic sur-
geon on 22 patients with a range of condi-
tions from hernias to tissue removal. Last
month, a carpenter from Bedford became the
first cancer patient in the country to have his
tumour removed by a robot. All 22 patients
have had significantly shorter recovery times
than those who had undergone normal sur-
gery, and College medical engineers are cur-
rently working to perfect a sense of touch for
the robot, in order to allow it to detect direct-
ly what sort of tissue it is in contact with.
