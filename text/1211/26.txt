Upcoming Summer Movies!
July
First up for July is Tomb Raider,
starring Angelina Jolie. Following
the slating by the American media,
I think that computer games made
from films is possibly moe effective
than vice-versa. Look out for some
unexpected appearances, including
R i m m e r from R e d D w a r f . High
Heels and Lowlifes is a brit flick
directed by Mel Smith. The plot
surrounds how a nurse plots to
blackmail some bankrobbers out of
their heist. With a cast including
M i n n i e D r i v e r and M i c h a e l
G a m b o n ( a l w a y s s u p e r b ) , this
could be one to watch for. This is
r e l e a s e d at the s a m e time as
Jurassic Park III. Steven Speilberg
is not having anything to do with
this one, so if you thought J P II
was a J P too far, I wouldn't even
consider this one. However, the
cast is surprisingly strong, S a m
N e i l l , W i l l i a m H M a c y and T e a
Leoni, so we may be all in for a
pleasant surprise. More appealing
s e e m s S w o r d f i s h starring J o h n
T r a v o l t a a n d D o n C h e a d l e .
Basically a heist film with a twist, it
follows how a computer hacker
tries to rob $6 billion dollars from
the government. Vinnie Jones also
makes an appearance in this one.
August
First this month is Rush Hour 2,
Anything with Jackie Chan has got
to be worth a good look. Final Final
Fantasy: The Spirits Within is a
computer animated film which looks
absolutely staggering. However, the
Japanese element is noticeable with
the indecipherable plot outline: A
female scientist makes a last stand
on Earth with the help of a ragtag
team of soldiers against an invasion
of alien phantoms. One for the Sci-
Fi freaks amongst us perhaps. Tim
Burton serves up Planet Of The
A p e s in mid-August. With M a r k
W a h l b e r g as the astronaut who
'accidentally' arrives on a strange
planet ruled by aliens after going
through a wormhole. This promises
to be one of the films to watch this
summer. Personally I'm interested in
seeing Helena Bonham-Carter as a
chimpanzee. Paul Hogan and Linda
K o z l o w s k i return for C r o c o d i l e
Dundee in LA. This could be midly
enjoyable or unbelievably bad. You
have been warned.
September
O n e to definitely look out for is
Moulin Rouge, with Nicole Kidman
and Ewan McGregor. It may be an
acquired taste with lots of music
and dancing, but it has already had
a lot of positive reviews following
the first screenings in Caan. Look
out for Kylie Minogue popping us as
a fairy! A few w e e k s later sees
Steven Speilbergs new film Artificial
Intelligence (Al). Starring Haley Joel
Osment (Sixth Sense) as an android
in the 21st century, this promises to
be a real treat. And then before you
know it, it's 12th October:^American
Pie 2 and the beginning of term.
