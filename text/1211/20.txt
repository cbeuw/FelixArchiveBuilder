Scuba Z
The Vanishing American
Family
(Odd Records)
This album is a musical pick 'n' mix
of big beat, funk, house and just
about anything else you can think of.
Eccentric, eclectic and, at times, a lit-
tle bit messy, this is an album that
never disappoints.
From the crazy funk of / Don't
Get Out Much to the guitary / acid
house crossover of Sharon Stone's
House, each track is different and
never really sounds like something
y o u ' v e h e a r d b e f o r e - the a l b u m
keeps you on the edge of your seat,
wondering where it'll go next.
Whilst featuring the singles Cali-
fornian Paranoia and Instant Whip, I
found that all of the tracks are equal-
ly appealing in their own way, but not
to everyone's taste. For example, if
the Vengaboys is as leftfield as you
like your music, don't bother with this
album (in fact, if that is the case, how
can you live with yourself?!).
This is a s e r i o u s l y t a s t y little
album and is definitely worth getting
your hands on.

Hard Hop Superstars
(Xtrahard)
There are g o o d t r a c k s on this
album, like Rock Da Funky Beats
and Operation Blade with their hands
in the air moments, and the surpris-
ingly laid back Pump Up Nation...
However, whilst you would dance
to most of this, there is the underpin-
ning fact that everything is actually
too gimmicky, a little insipid and a lit-
tle unoriginal for this to actually be a
g o o d a l b u m . A t least they're not
Oxide and Neutrino.

King Adora
Vibrate You
(Superior Quality Recordings)
King A d o r a m a n a g e m e n t
meeting:
Boss of record label: "So we've
signed the band. They've got to
rock like Iggy P o p on c h e a p
orange squash and E-numbers.
They need tunes, arrogance and
some guitars. They've got to have
sex appeal."
KA Manager: "OK. Check "rock-
ing". Check tunes and arrogance.
C h e c k sex a p p e . . . . o h fuck.
They're pug ugly."
Boss of record label: "Oh well.
We'll dress them like early Manic
S t r e e t P r e a c h e r s who've met
some goths down a dark alley. No
one will notice."
A n d you have King A d o r a .
W h o do take after M S P , but
without the intelligence. They've
got the tunes though. The debut
album from the Birmingham four
piece is polished, and you can see
why N M E put them on their cover
over a year ago. But if you're
going to "do" arrogance, you real-
ly have to be the dog's testicles
to get a w a y with it. S i n g l e s
Bionic and Suffocate are slabs of
pop rock that will have the kids
moshing in the aisles, but Maxi
Browne's whine, which is at first
alluring, really begins to piss me
off after the 4th or 5th track
which replaces a chorus with a
whining scream. Maxi says on the
final track "I will irritate you". No
need, Maxi. You're good enough
at it already.
And when they drop in a few
electronic beats here and there to
prove their modernity, you just
know that there was someone
from A&R lounging in the studio
saying "Yeah guys, it'll sound
great, trust me" as the band
stood there looking unsure.
H o w e v e r , don't get the
impression that there is anything
wrong with this C D . Every song
does have big shiny sharp hooks
that you could catch a shark with.
The lyrics (between the whines)
are never banal. The solos are
never cheesy. There is not a song
on the disc that you would really
want to fast forward through.
Nevertheless it is easy to tell
which songs were, are, or shall be
singles: the songs easily fall into
"power pop" or "punk/giarrT^ats-
gories. They're not the Manics.
They're not Mansun. But they're
the next best thing: the Manics
for those who can't be arsed to
read M a r x and find out what
Willem de Kooning used to con-
template. (Oh, and buy the spe-
cial edition: extra t r a c k s and
videos. You can show it off when
K A have sold out and boast about
"owning rare early stuff'.)

All This Sounds Gas
(Domino)
Preston School of Industry, featur-
ing guitarist Scott Kannberg, are
most likely to appeal to fans of Kann-
burg's former band, Pavement. In the
same mould as Pavement, they have a
quirky guitar-based sound, with whim-
sical vocals and a strong backline.
The overall feel of All This Sounds
Gas is one of a band having fun, and
as a result the music is fairly uplifting
- perhaps one to listen to over the
summer months - but there is also an
edge to the music hinting at some-
thing a bit more "serious". The songs
are experimental, but maintain a dis-
tinctly p o p p y a p p e a l . It could be
argued that Steve Malkumus is doing
this kind of thing better but still, this
one is worth a listen.

The London Xpress Album
(Nuphonic Records)
w ;
th rare cuts from the likes of
C o l d c u t , G r o o v e Armada and
Red Snapper, I was expecting some-
thing pretty special from this compila-
tion of artists who have contributed to
mm
the London Xpress Radio show over
the last year. It is certainly eclectic, and
almost every track refuses to fall into a ,
s p e c i f i c d a n c e music category.
However, a broad theme of downbeat |
electronica emerges, with hints of tech-
no, dub and jazz creeping in occasional-
ly. Sabres of Paradise, David Holmes |
and even Bjork are also featured.
Unfortunately, there are no real
stand-out tracks, which could explain
why they haven't been released before.
S o m e of the stuff does sound quite
experimental and progressive, but like
all experiments, it doesn't always pro-
duce good results. There is some good j
stuff here, but I'd only recommend this I
to completists who already have a lot of I
these artists' material. Tom
