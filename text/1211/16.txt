who go out drinking, and pretend they never
work for exams. Those sort of people piss me
off. They think you're sad just because you
work. We're privileged to be here, so people
who think it's not cool to work for your degree
are the ones who are most likely to label peo-
ple geeks.
S o do y o u think it's m o r e of an i n t e r n a l
p r o b l e m ?
Medics tend to be rude about others like engi-
neers or p h y s i c i s t s , saying "Oh they're so
geeky", it's ridiculous, especially at our age, but
they do.
W h e n one of my friends came here, she
said "Oh my G o d , it looks like a factory where
they keep all the people working in their labo-
ratories under the street", so when I came I
was quite relieved to find people were normal.
I think if someone was shallow enough to
be put off by the image, then they probably
wouldn't get on very well here anyway.

The word geek is a derogatory word, so I don't
think it could ever be used in a positive way.
Now that I've been here for a while, I forgot
about that whole geek thing, and reading some
of the uni guides reminded me of it. When I
was applying to unis, it did say stuff like that
about IC, and now I think it is such a pile of
poo, because it's just not true, and people here
know that. I think it is important that people
outside IC realise how unrealistic it is, so that
people aren't put off coming to IC, and so that
girls in particular aren't put off coming here.

I admit that I have complained about the num-
ber of geeky guys. There is blatantly a lot, but
there are a lot of other people too. In general, I
don't think people are completely geeky. They
do have different interests.
W h a t is a g e e k ?
I think a geeky guy is someone who is com-
pletely obsessed with their subject, and does-
n't think about anything else. I know people
who, in between lectures, they talk about lec-
tures. They come down the Union and they talk
about lectures. That's not a bad thing. It just
seems there's not much more to them apart
from what subject they do, and what they
know about that subject.
IC's image could put people off coming
here if they think it is going to be really boring
socially. When I first came here, it was a bit
hard to find people with similar interests to me.
I've made loads of friends through RockSoc
though, so it's just a matter of making an
effort.
In the last couple of years it has got a lot
better. The number of girls on my course has
doubled.
