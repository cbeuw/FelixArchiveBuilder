Insurance and genetic testing
to doubt everyone at Imperial welcomed the
'ittsburgh findings on Alzheimer's published
larlier this month. The study identified a pre-
ciusly uncharacterized genetic mutation as
King a significant risk factor for the disease,
(hen present alongside other known genetic
Buses. Yet as editors pieced together the
jtest 'study prompts cure hope' headlines,
datives of sufferers could be forgiven for
lishing scientists would leave the area alone.
Vhy? Genetic testing for a disease benefits
[roups other than those at risk - it benefits
isurance firms.

lack of a central European legal ruling on the
subject. While in Holland genetic information
includes family history and can not generally
be used by insurance companies, German law

tone of this is particularly new. I was remind-
;d of the debate after reading an article in
lSE Magazine (LSE's alumni rag), written by
Vina Dixon and Dr Elias Mossialos from the
an individual's s u c c e s s in life, this m a d e
sense - we were introducing a sense of fair-
ness into an unfairly chaotic world. A s we dis-
cover more and more genetic f a c t o r s that
contribute to all aspects of our lives this nat-
ural socialism is and will continue to be erod-
ed. Coupled with the increasingly determinis-
tic world-view of our blame-culture, it is a
recipe for social disaster.
I started with a piece of scientific research,
and noted that even the best-intended sci-
ence will raise problems and issues beyond
its original domain. There is simply no such
thing as objective ethically neutral research.
During my time at Imperial I was constantly
amazed by how little interest many students
showed in the humanities and social sciences,
indeed often in any fields outside of their
own. When asked the reply was often not so
much a perceived lack of interest, but a lack
of utility; "I don't think it's relevant to what I
do" would c o m e the r e s p o n s e . W e l l , think
again.
