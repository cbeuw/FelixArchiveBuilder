he Felix Editor, with advertising in student pub-
tions invariably carried out o n credit, credit
Itrol is h a n d l e d by t h e U n i o n ' s o w n f i n a n c e
artment. In a meeting which took place later
Mr Clifford told Felix staff, "This bizarre figure
ased on obscene incompetence from all parties
olved... it's a shame no-one asked me about it."
fe added, "The main problem isn't sending out
Dices for this term- most issues have been paid
with profit from earlier terms, which w a s all
loiced and should have been paid by now. O u r
liest problem stems from Marchfirst."
Barchfirst w a s a multinational strategy consul-
icy company, which essentially provided m a n -
ment advice for Internet start-up businesses,
rough it survived the "bursting" of the "Internet
ible" fairly intact, the c o m p a n y later ran into
jlems when its C E O , J o e Firmage, announced
belief that all human technology w a s derived
j
m aliens. He later left in order to set up a pub-
Joe Firmage: Alien
lishing company in order to further his beliefs.
It w a s t h e s t a r t of a d o w n h i l l s p i r a l f o r
Marchfirst, whose European arm finally went bust
last month, and employees in several cities broke
into the company's offices in order to reclaim pos-
sessions and obtain severance pay. A t the begin-
ning of this year, Marchfirst took out a series of
full colour, full-page advertisements in Felix, but
later claimed that they would be unable to pay until
M r Clifford explained why the adverts were about
two shades out (although most people could notice
any difference). Unable to do s o , and aware of
M i ' s problems, he sought the Union's advice, who
r e c o m m e n d e d he offer them a " s u b -
stantial d i s c o u n t " . D e s p i t e this, M1
are still believed to owe Felix around
£3,000 for October's advertising, and
Finance Office are pessimistic about
the c h a n c e s of any money from the
receivers.
M r Clifford denied that he w a s at
fault over M a r c h f i r s t , but did admit
that he had got behind on invoicing
• this term, which he attributed to "Felix
H H | E d i t o r in S u m m e r S y n d r o m e " ; t o o
™ m u c h to d o , too many people doing
— exams. The £8,000 backlog of invoic-
• H B B H m g was cleared during the eight days
conspiracies Felix w a s s u s p e n d e d , he a d d e d , and
he expected that Felix would receive all the money
it w a s o w e d , assuming no more companies went
bankrupt. Exec ordered that M r Clifford cleared
the entire backlog of the invoices before Felix be
allowed to go to press this week.
Felix staff were described as feeling "frustrated"
at having a weeks' worth of work go to waste, and
all felt that if Exec or M r Pollard had a problem
with their editor's conduct, they should be able to
talk to him face-to-face rather than making deci-
sions behind closed doors.
F o l l o w i n g the r e - i n s t a t e m e n t late last w e e k ,
shortly before Etienne left for his holidays, M r
Clifford told staff, "It's a shame that Felix, which
has always looked for transparency and fairness in
the Union, should be treated like this. If you have a
problem with someone, you should be able to talk
to them about it rather than making allegations and
decisions behind peoples' backs. A s well as making
us miss an issue, it reflects pretty badly on the
whole Union."
