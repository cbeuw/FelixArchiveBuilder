When I s t a r t e d d o i n g film
reviews for Felix, the only
c o m p u t e r animated feature film
was Toy Stoy. Since then, a whole
new genre has spawned with the
advent of big flashy computers and
the c o m p a n y P i x a r , w h o are
responsible for both Toy Stories
and the excellent Antz. The com-
puter generated film goes to a new
level with the jaw dropping Final
Fantasy, released this summer, but
you can read more about that in
the Summer preview.
Shrek is Pixar's new offering and is
made with the same verve, which
made their previous offerings so
s u c c e s s f u l . C l e v e r l y they have
once agian realised once you have
a good story, with interesting char-
a c t e r s , the h u m o u r and f l a s h y
graphics part of it polish off the
entire thing rather nicely.
Shrek is a quiet ogre (voiced by
Mike Myers), who wants nothing
more than to be left alone in his
peaceful swamp. However, the evil
prince Farquaad banishes all of the
fairytale characters from his king-
dom to Shrek's swamp, much to
our heros annoyance. To rid his
home off all these irritating and
badly behaved layabouts (I mean
the wolf from Little R e d riding
Hood is smoking in his bed!) he
must find the prince a wife. Off
Shrek goes with his goofy donkey
c o m p a n i o n ( v o i c e d by E d d i e
M u r p h y ) to find the e n v i a b l e
Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) so
that the prince can turn S h r e k ' s
swamp back to its original tranquil-
lity.
This film is very funny indeed, not
only b e c a u s e of the purile
b u r p / f a r t humour for the young
children (and men) but also the
more sophisticated jokes aimed at
the more sesible members of the
audience (women). In the main line
of fire is Disney, with the film being
very cynical to all things sugary
and sweet. There are numerous
s e n d ups with q u o t e s and mis-
q u o t e s from f a m o u s f i l m s . M y
favourite is The Matrix piss take
and also the interrogation of a gin-
g e r b r e a d man, all involving the
princess character.
Shrek is an excellent film which will
be lauded for months to come.
Shrek is out on Friday.

Another Life is yet another Brit
film, which unlike the v a s t
majority is actually pretty good.
However, it is not based on drug
dealing in S w a n s e a or anything
e l s e a l o n g t h o s e l i n e s , but
Edwardian England. Which is why,
unfortunately, no-one except your
mum is going to go and watch it.
The story is based on real life inci-
dents surrounding Edith Thonpson,
who was hanged in the late 1920's
for her part in the murder of her
h u s b a n d , P e r c y , by her lover
Freddie Bywaters. All the evidence
at the time, and this film, is made
sympathetic to her involvement in
the crime. Bywaters himself admit-
ted to the crime and in his last
days protested Thompson's inno-
cence ultimately in vain.
This film essentially follows her
tragic life from before her marriage
prior to the First W o r l d W a r up
until her final day on death row.
Natasha Lee puts in a very good
performance as Thompson, whom
we are led to believe is an outgo-
ing and funloving women restricted
by both her husband and soceity.
Moran plays Percy, a totally differ-
ent role from the character he is
best known in Lock Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels. However, he fails
to find his feet as much as the
other a c t o r s , and along with a
rather daft accent, can be consid-
e r e d at b e s t adequate.
N o n e t h e l e s s he puts across the
main point of his character, that of
being a charming teenager who,
through his old age becomes an
introverted and oppressive to his
wife.
Gruffudd, who plays Bywaters is
e x c e l l e n t giving a dashing andj
extrovert character a rather sinis-
ter side. The chemistry between
him and Lee is also worthy of note,
as it is their characters relationship
which is the driving force of the
film. A l t h o u g h their chemistry
doesn't light up the screen it is
good enough to be plausible.
The film follows quite a long period!
of time, at least twenty years and
director G o o d h e w must be com-
mended for letting the film run its
course and, while not showing a
high degree of flair, doing a solid!
job reacreating an English tragedy.
Another Life is out now.
