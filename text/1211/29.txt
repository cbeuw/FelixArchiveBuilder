Nth a bigger vocabulary than any other root
vegetable I've met, for he did many a cross-
pord at the beginning of this year before I
jven ventured into this office. These thanks
|re so richly deserved because it does in fact
take rather a while to compile one of thiese
pings and can, done regularly, take impor-
tant chunks of time away from your academ-
ic, social and sex lives (though Dr Hot Fudge
Combined the task with the latter quite
effectively). Thanks of course to the Editor,

Pnd them into me. Also, thanks for putting

for the dictionary and self-flagellating
tirades when I realised phenomenon wasn't
officially spelt with "Do-do-do-do-do" sung
after it, as well as occasionally proofing and

Vorderman who took more verbal abuse than
a television presenter generally deserves.
Finally, thanks to Mike and Will who are just
great people and (if you'll indulge me) my
flatmates, parents, producers of all fine Eng-
lish dictionaries and every single person who
has ever worked behind the bar in the Union.
