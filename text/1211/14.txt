Image Issues
IC is often perceived as being full of geeky guys. How true is this, and what effect is it having?
Felix asked these girls what they thought...
T O M B A I L E S S
What is the first thing you think of when
people talk about IC? World-class tech-
nical i n s t i t u t i o n ? C e n t r e of c u t t i n g e d g e
research? Or just a place full of geeky guys?
These things may be true, and I have no prob-
lem with the first two, but the last is a worry.
Whether it is an issue depends how seriously
people take it. I've had the good-natured rib-
bing from friends back home, but that's just
annoying, rather than a major problem. When
you start to think that is how IC is perceived by
the majority, it makes you sit up. What sur-
prised me is how almost every university guide
from The Guardian to Virgin Student all make
some reference to it. Felix has set out to find if
people were worried about this image, what
effects it has on them, and whether indeed they
thought it was a bad thing at all. When thinking
about who to ask, we thought it best to start
with people who are being most unfairly tagged
with the "geeky guy" stigma, that is, people who
are most definitely not geeky guys. What's the
opposite to a geeky guy? Why, an outgoing,
confident, young woman of course!
W e found some volunteers for this task and
asked them what they thought. To give a face to
the voice, we decided to take some pictures to
go with it. I hope that these contrast with typical
ideas of the IC geek.
Laura, Medicine
W h e n y o u t h i n k of I C , d o y o u t h i n k
t h e r e is a p r o b l e m w i t h its i m a g e ?
I'd say yes. There is a lack of females, apart
from in medicine. People know about that lack
of females, and I think they draw their own con-
clusions from it.
I think t h e r e are more g e e k s at Imperial,
because you have to be quite intelligent to get
here, and also we don't have any arts subjects.
D o y o u think that d e f i n e s a g e e k ?
That, and someone who keeps themselves to
themselves, and doesn't socialise, people who
keep their heads down. It's really nothing to do
with being good at your work. It's like they don't
k n o w how to c o m m u n i c a t e , t h e y are just
obsessed with their work. I think some people
resent others like that, because they are good
at their work
D o y o u think b e i n g a g e e k a l w a y s h a s
n e g a t i v e i m p l i c a t i o n s ?
I think it could have positive implications - it
could mean that you are a really hard worker,
you're dedicated to your work, but that could
also show that something is lacking, like you
don't have any social life at all.
H a s I C ' s i m a g e h a d a n y c o n s e q u e n c e s
on y o u ?
Not really, no. I think it does mean that the
medics tend to club together. That is a bit of a
problem, but I don't want to be a part of that.
D o e s it m a t t e r that IC h a s this image?
Yeah, to a certain extent. I think people do go
elsewhere for social events. There is a stigma
attached to Union events.
A r e t h e r e a n y g i r l s y o u w o u l d c a l l
g e e k y ?
Not here, I have to say. I do know some, but I
haven't met any at IC. It's very hard to label
someone.
D o y o u think t h e i m a g e of IC is wide-
s p r e a d ?
No, not really. I think it's more of an internal
thing. People just think that things are better
elsewhere, when really it's not.

There is an enormous mix of people here. There
are people from council estates, and I know
people who have millionaire parents. One of my
