Sou I wax
DJing @ 333 club
Soulwax? Adding to the fact they do
records, they also perform D J sets.
Recently they hit an East London
llub and burnt the place with their
irenzied tunes for two hours. A
jroovy slap that turns sullen and reti-
;ent ones into bouncing dancers.
Passion is on their side, the two
brothers, coming all the way from
Belgium, look like hard core music
bns that play their fav tunes. That
jives a mix of 80s and 90s hits; some
songs you, at least I, last heard ages
igo, when big hair and stripes were
/ery fashionable, on your big broth-
;r*s turntable just before, in a brazen
nove, throwing the record through
[he window, stopping his music dicta-
torship. Ears don't believe it, S
Express , Vanilla Ice, Mickael
lackson with the theme from Billy
lean acting like the show leitmotiv,
ven Pump up the Jam from
echnotronic, so good. That's music
tie body can't stop stop rythming on,
;ven on hits hated 10 years ago.
Soulwax succeed to make sound
»ol really old fashioned stuff. Recent
jtles are not forgotten, since
tedonna Music is mixed with Daft
'unk. The Dewaele brothers love
nixing, very funny when DJing, on •
he verge to jump and frenetically
lance on their decks. Rest your feet
Wore they're back in London.
Turin Brakes
Supported by David Kitt @ ULU
According to the band them-
s e l v e s , this w a s a return
home for Turin Brakes, their first
headline gig in the U K for some
time. A b l y s u p p o r t e d by two
other impressive - though slight-
ly strange - acts, they put on a
show worthy of a homecoming
celebration.
S u p p o r t c a m e from David
Kitt, a young Irish singer and
guitarist. He was accompanied
by a woodwind player who we
c o u l d h a r d l y hear ( a c t u a l l y I
don't think his mic was turned
on) and a bearded guy who sat
cross-legged on the floor, play-
ing a m i n i a t u r e k e y b o a r d .
Strangely, the percussion w a s
all recorded - maybe the drum-
mer couldn't make it. Despite
s o m e overly long tracks with
exaggerated endings and per-
haps trying too hard to sound
like David Gray, Kitt and his col-
leagues c a m e up with a thor-
oughly promising slice of folk-
pop.
W e were then treated to a
c o m p l e t e l y u n e x p e c t e d but
totally enjoyable performance
from an African drum troupe,
before the main event began.
Turin Brakes kept a packed
audience involved, interested
and excited throughout, playing
tracks from their recent L P The
Optimist and some new material
too. Even though the set lasted
for over an hour, the band main-
tained interest with variation in
all the key musical areas. The
bassist, drummer and keyboard
player occasionally sat out, leav-
ing the two original band mem-
bers to perform s o m e of the
slower, more reflective tracks,
notably the excellent Futureboy.
P r e d i c t a b l y , it w a s the
band's most familiar track, the
r e c e n t l y r e l e a s e d single The
U n d e r d o g ( S a v e M e ) , w h i c h
provoked the biggest audience
reaction. Less predictably, the
live v e r s i o n w a s e v e n b e t t e r
than the single - this was much
appreciated.
A g r e a t live b a n d , Turin
Brakes' rise to fame is sure to
continue. They come highly rec-
ommended.

Swell
Everybody wants to know
(Beggars Banquet)
It's still called Swell, but the band is
now reduced to his singer/compositor
David Freel (as written in the sleeve
"guitar, keyboards, vocals and other
crap"), helped on half of the songs by
the drummer Rey Wasam. This sixth
album (some songs of which are from
the recent E P "feeds") sounds like all
Swell's stuff: an acoustic background,
transpierced by electric loops, with this
particular voice like a haunting lament.
But it's darker and with less detach-
ment: the songs are good, but their
hypnotic construction now sometimes
sounds repetitive, guitars are rougher,
the singing deeper... This general
blackness looks like a disillusion -
except on a few songs, on "like pover-
ty" or "... a velvet sun" the magi is still
efficient.
The reduction of the team is maybe
due to the world indifference that had
to face the band for almost ten years,
and that's a shame as these lo-fi and
charmful tunes can be captivating.
"Everybody wants ..." is a pleasant
album and I'll give it three points, but I
highly recommend the excellent 41 and
Too Many Days Without Thinking ones,
and hope that Swell will one day earn
the little success they deserve.

Brassic Beats Vol.1
(Skint)
This is a real C l a s s i c Originally
released in 1996, Brassic Beats intro-
duced the world to the Skint sound,
pioneers of Big Beat. The compilation
has some great, timeless classics, such
as Everybody needs a 303 by Fatboy
Slim and Bentley's Gonna Sort You Out
by Bentley Rhythm Ace. Also mixed are
Midfield General, Req and Cut Le
Roc.Not all of the tracks are amazing,
but what is here is definitely worth a
purchase. Tom
