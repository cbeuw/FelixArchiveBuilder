Thankyou and goodbye
As the sun streams into my office I recall
the last time I switched my office fan on
(during J u l y last y e a r ) , and I find m y s e l f
writing my last ever column for Felix - my
first one being a few y e a r s a g o in
N o v e m b e r 1996 in my former guise
as 'Westminster Eye'. It's the end of
another year for the student popula-
tion at Imperial and for some the end
of s o m e of o u r t i m e at I m p e r i a l
College.
W h e n I first started at the Union
knew I was taking over an organisa-
tion of immense variety and complex-
ity with clubs and societies spanning
an unparalleled breadth of activity. I
am still learning about other activities
we do today. I remember a carefully-
phrased set of general policies from
my election campaign including bring-;;
ing d e c i s i o n - m a k i n g c l o s e r to s t u - l
dents, negotiating constructively but firmly
with the College and considering the Union's
role in a multi-campus C o l l e g e . I admit I've
done some, had others do some for me, and
d o n e l e s s f f S o m e t i m e s
o n
A
o t h e r s
n and s o m e t i m e s
aspect o f n
m y job this frustrating
year which s e p a r a t e s it from other U n i o n
posts is the amount of time negotiating with
the College. I don't and never did think they
were there to conspire against students - I
can't believe s o m e o n e would take a senior
job in a university who did. However, I have
learnt that there are a variety of individuals
within the C o l l e g e from those who see the
student view as integral to how they operate
to those who know better than us more lowly
beings on what is best for us. This has been
sometimes illuminating and sometimes frus-
trating. It is satisfying to see a College-wide
policy change as the result of your input on
what's best for students, less so when peo-
ple consistently refuse to d i s c u s s an issue
affecting students with you in the hope of
p r e s e n t i n g s o m e fait a c c o m p l i at a later
date, or because they can't imagine students
could make a useful contribution.
Having said that, the College and its staff
are normally very keen to help students in
trouble a n d , curiously e n o u g h , one of the
more depressing and surprising a s p e c t s of
this year has been the unwillingness of many
students to approach the Union when they
are in trouble. There was even a student liv-
ing in my own halls of residence who did not

Last of all, I would like to acknowledge the
| r e s i d e n t s of L i n s t e a d Hall, which I
have spent far too little time in this
year, even though I apparently live
there: thanks naturally goes to the
wardening team and re-apps includ-
ing C h i e f S a r a h , C l a r e of Bradford,
S c a r y C l a r e , L e s s s c a r y E m m a ,
Industrious Babs, Rebecca & Mischa
the Imposter, Alistair, Sandy and any
others who shouldn't take offence I
can't recall their names. Thanks too
to my landing neighbours Tom, Andy
and S a c h a , plus B r a d and Rik who
effectively lived there and together
helped re-invigorate my faith in the
f u t u r e of t h e m e d i c a l p r o f e s s i o n
whilst taking up much of the Linstead
