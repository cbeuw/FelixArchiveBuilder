Evolution
Director: Ivan Reitman
S t a r r i n g : D a v i d D u c h o v n y ,
Julianne Moore and Sean W-
Scott
Mmmm, Evolution. Films with
single scientifically worded
titles, should be approached with
care. As everyone knows they can
be good (The Matrix) or more likely
they can be bad (The Cell).
Evolution has good credentials. For
a start it is directed by Ivan
Reitman, one of the most success-
ful comedic directors of the
I980's. Secondly it stars Julianne
Moore, fresh from the success of
Hannibal.
However it stars David Duchovny,
the man who will be forever known
is Fox Mulder. The mentality
behind him starring in a film, I really
don't understand. For the last
decade almost he has been investi-
gating aliens in the X-Files. In this
Plm guess whathe is investigat-
|g aliens. Next is Sean William-
Scott, whose previous outings have
pen as inane college idiot in Road
rip and Dude, Where's My Car?
fie word 'stereotype' immediately
ings to mind.
pe plot of the film is not very origi-
fel. Wayne Green (Scott) discov-
[S a meteorite that has landed in
HI
the middle of the desert. Duchovny
plays the oddly named Ira Kane, a
college professor who is sent to
investigate. However, soon things
get out of control when aliens start
springing out of the rock. The mili-
tary are then called in to stop the
evolution under the watchful eye of
government scientist Allison Reed
(Moore).
Unbelievably this film was actually
written as a Sci-Fi thriller.
However, when the director has
films such as Ghostbusters II and
Twins to his credit, you know that
'thriller' is possibly used in the
widest sense of the word. In fact, if
it was a thriller, it would have been
absolute shite and not worth
watching. Instead it is merely a
comedy of the nature of Reitman's
previous projects. The humour isn't
groundbreaking and the perform-
ances range from average through
to shocking.
All in all it's a run of the mill film
Hollywood film. I wouldn't recom-
mend spending your hard earned
cash on it in the cinema. If and
when you're suicidally bored,
watch it on video.
And finally....
Well then, the end is nigh, and this
is my last little section. And to
your boredom I'm gonna say some
thankyous. But that's tough
because without these folks there
would be no film pages, and more
importantly I'd have to pay to see
them. First the reviewers: Tom,
Imran, Aamar, George, Katherine
and Dave. Thanks for your help.
Many thanks to: Angie@lime,
Naomi@beatwax, Jeni and
Claire@ddapr, Tom@metrodome,
Anna@sony, Anne@momentum,
Engin@entertainment-film and
Holly@mission-21.
A special thankyou to
Sharon@Odeon for the competi-
tions and letting me into the Arnie
premiere!
Evolution is out now.

Here are a quick rundown on two
films I've seen out this summer:
Sidewalks of NY
This is the new Edward Burns film,
which he stars in and also directs.
It is a documentary style film, fol-
lowing the life of six people in New
York and how their lives overlap
through relationships they have
with people.
Heather Graham stars alongside a
host of actors, all of whom you
know the faces, but not their
names. However, it is Dennis
Farina as a hilarious womanising
TV host who steals the limelight.
This isn't an easy film to watch,
but is ulimately very intelligent.
A Knights Tale
A medieval story, where from the
first scene of them singing "We
Will Rock you", you know isn't
going to be that historically accu-
rate.
Heath Ledger is the thatchers boy
who becomes champion jouster for
the hand of the beautiful proncess.
However, his nemesis, Count
Adhemar, played quite dreadfully
by Rufus Sewell has unfinished
business with our young hero at
the Jousting World
Championships.
This is a truly dire film, in which
the only thing worth watching is
the black haired lady blacksmith.
