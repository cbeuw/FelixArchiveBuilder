friends here is a single mother. All of the gen-
eralisations are just untrue.
Do y o u t h i n k t h e r e is an i s s u e of I C ' s
image o u t s i d e of c o l l e g e ?
Ithink it is a bit of a problem. The first impres-
sion that a lot of people get is that of loads of
guys, and I suppose that some do look geeky.
What is a g e e k ?
Someone wearing very conventional clothes,
with their hair greased back, wearing glasses. I
always thought a geek was just a stereotype,
but I have seen a few people round who really
lit the image, just visually though - I don't know
them. They lock themselves in their rooms, and
play with their computers for hours. But gener-
ally people are fine. All my friends are really
outgoing.
[Do y o u t h i n k it is a p r o b l e m ? Is it a
oegative t h i n g ?
I
t would be a problem if it was the majority, but
it is such a tiny minority, and I think you get
them at any university.
Do y o u t h i n k that t h e e x t e r n a l i m a g e of
IC has a f f e c t e d y o u ?
Not directly, and I don't think it would, because
think that the academic reputation of Imperial
outweighs any other image. They think "good
college", I don't think it's the first thing that
they think of.
So why d o y o u t h i n k all of t h e s e exter-
lal u n i v e r s i t y g u i d e s h a v e h o n e d in on
ibis?
lone person just wandered round the Union,
Ihey probably would see more guys than girls
and draw conclusions from that. If they were
actually at the uni, they would see that there is
so much more to IC.
People at IC are a lot more single minded than
at other unis and want to do well. Whether
they wear Iron Maiden T-shirts and tatty white
trainers is neither here nor there. It's an exter-
nal perception that these people are geeks.

W h a t d o y o u t h i n k of t h e I C ' s i m a g e ,
a n d is that i m a g e r e l e v a n t ?
I don't think it should matter what image some
one else has put on your university. It should
only matter what you perceive yourself as. If
you're happy with yourself and what your per-
sonality's like, it shouldn't really matter what
other people have labelled you as. If people
come up to me and say "you're from IC" and
therefore it must mean a certain thing, I would-
n't let that bother me.
D o p e o p l e j u d g e y o u ?
A couple of people have said, "Oh you're at IC,
it must be really unnerving, there's so many
males." When you come in the first year, it is
kind of strange at first. There are so many
boys, but gradually it's O K , it's not too bad.
Boys make great friends, if not better friends
than girls.
It's natural that a certain proportion are going
to be "electronically gifted" [geeky], shall we
say. With so many guys, I don't think that pro-
portion is any worse than at other unis. Also,
being a university of science and technology,
you do expect people to be more into sciencey
things, which is perhaps one of the things that
is associated with geeks.
A r e y o u a g e e k ?
(laughs) W e l l , maybe... I don't lock myself
away in my room.
Is it a n e g a t i v e i m a g e ?
I don't think it is. If it makes us seem hard
working and intelligent, I think that's a good
thing.
Heather, Medicine (again!)
W h a t d o y o u f e e l a b o u t h o w IC is per-
c e i v e d by t h e p u b l i c ?
I think it's a shame that we do have that image,
but I think people should realise it's not like
that, especially because there are more girls
coming into IC now. The medical school has
changed that sex ratio quite a lot. With any
science subject, there is always that reputation
of geeks and nerds. I think that could offend
some people, because they don't want to be
classified as such, on the other hand, we are a
lively bunch, and science isn't just about read-
ing books.
H a v e y o u h a d n e g a t i v e e x p e r i e n c e s
f r o m b e i n g a s s o c i a t e d w i t h I C ?
Sometimes people think I am nerd, but that's
just ridiculous. I think it's more of a male thing
to be honest. I have female friends who came
here to do engineering and chemistry, and they
weren't put off by the image.
W h e r e d o e s t h e i m a g e c o m e f r o m ?
I think it's propagated by rugby player types
