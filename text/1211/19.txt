Dear Ed
I just w a n t e d to congratulate
Ihe summer ball team on putting
on a brilliant ball this y e a r - it
was the best one I've been too
md thought that the whole event
»as great.
As the ball was a sell-out and
extra tickets were made available
is well, surely the ball has made
some profit this y e a r . M y s e l f ,
ind numerous people I've spoken
too, are concerned about where
any profit would go. W e thought
that any profit should be put into
a s u m m e r b a l l f u n d a n d go
towards making next year's ball
just as good (if not better - is
this possible!!! W e l l , faster bar
service in the jcr would've been
better, but that's my only c o m -
plaint!). H o w e v e r , we have the
nasty s u s p i c i o n that the union
nay just cream any profits and
put it t o w a r d s f u n d i n g s o m e
trap union event, like that disas-
trous c o m e d y night w i t h t h a t
Woke from the fast show.
wonder if we could get s o m e
feedback on this point - what do
other p e o p l e think? W o u l d the
onion people listen to what stu-
ients w a n t e d it put t o w a r d s
(doubtful)?

Dear Sir,
The Summer Ball 2001 was for
many people (including myself),
in i m p o r t a n t c h a n c e to s a y
larewell before leaving Imperial.
Mter four years at IC, I am writ-
ing to Felix for the first and last
time to actually say something
positive - the ball was excellent!
The d i v e r s i t y of e n t e r t a i n m e n t
was especially pleasing, and the
live music w a s s e n s a t i o n a l . I'm
sure that other c o r r e s p o n d e n t s
will inform us of organisational
shortcomings (there were a few)
but I echo the view of many pun-
ters that it was a
supremely fun evening.
W e l l , I'll keep this short. G o o d
luck to everyone who is graduat-
ing this year.
Yours,
A s a n g a Gunatillaka

Surprisingly, no letters slagging
it off, two letters of praise. Good
job Idris and co. And of course
the Union Staff and volunteers-

ocurring in a bit of Sherfield lots
of us use -Research C o n t r a c t s ?
In J a n u a r y there w a s 8 people
w o r k i n g in it. N o w 6 of t h e m
have left or are l e a v i n g . W e ' v e

from the medical school by Lynn
Cox, who I see has got the extra

Directors around Sherfield than
there are flies around a pile of

I c a l l a g o o d pay d e a l . M o r e
money and less staff; can we all
