in crime, is also responsible for
this killing off, with live streaming
and pirate downloads of movies.
I’ll probably get a lot of hate mail
from fan boys for saying this…
but in my humble opinion it really
does not take long to master the
console controller especially if it’s
ergonomically designed specifically
for gaming and ease of use. If you
compare it to using a keyboard and
mouse (yes, I am a PC gamer) you
will find it’s a lot easier to execute
your commands on time that make
getting that head-shot a lot simpler.
How to test my claim? Try playing
FIFA on PC using a keyboard and
you’ll see what I’m talking about.
Also have you ever wondering why
no one’s ever implemented cross
platform online gaming? Because
being a console gamer in a Call of
Duty Lobby with PC gamers is like
finding yourself in a lobby full of
noobs – as in, it’s not exactly fair.
I actually considered re-evaluating
my decision on the cost effectiveness
of consoles compared to gaming
PCs. This is because now, you have
to pay for online/multiplayer gaming
on both the Xbox One and PS4
which 99% of gamers will get either
one, the other or both. When it was

5 Things Consoles are killing
With the recent releases of the
Xbox One and PlayStation 4, it’s
high time we examine the victims
consoles have claimed since their
heralding in the 70’s. Will they be the
ultimate culprit in our murder series?
The great thing about consoles is
their price relative to gaming PC rigs.
With the Xbox One currently at £430
and the PS4 standing at £80 less, it’s
no wonder so many gamers flock
to consoles instead. With the same
amount of ‘console money’ you’d only
manage to buy a ‘student’ PC and by
that I mean a computer that handles
Microsoft office and RuneScape if you
fancy a bit of that. For you to handle
a hardcore game such as Battlefield
4 or Crysis 3 at decent frame-rates
and maxed out settings, you’re
looking at easily over £1000. With the
current state of tuition fees, I don’t
think any university gamer has that
amount of free cash lying around.
Before buying a next generation
console, whether it is a PlayStation,
Xbox or Nintendo, one of the main
gamer concerns is whether they can
play their old games collected over
the past decade on the new systems.
It is never more dismaying to find the
many game titles on your bookshelf
that you still haven’t touched or
completed unplayable on your new
system that you’ve invested in. By
that, ladies and gentlemen, I’m
referring to the Xbox One,which
does not let you play 360 games,
which is such a shame considering
many big titles being released
recently on the 360 such as Battlefield
4. PlayStation 4 certainly isn’t off the
hook either, but at least they’ve tried
to remedy their ‘hardware mishap’
by allowing previous console titles
available via online streaming.
Since the release of the PlayStation
2 in 2001, consoles have had their
own inbuilt DVD, and now, Blue
Ray players. The only place you
would find a DVD player is e-bay,
and even Blue Rays are starting to
feel the market shift. Of course, the
internet, gaming consoles partner

the 360 vs. the PS3, the main benefit
the PS3 had was that you didn’t have
to pay extra fees to game online,
unlike the 360; you’d just have to buy
the console, the game and you’re set.
Now, it costs $60 a year subscription
fee for the Xbox one and $50 for the
PS4. Fairly ridiculous if you think
about it, the main reason I buy games
is for the online content and playing
with some guy across the globe in
Hong Kong (who’d probably woop
my ass). Console story mode and
online gaming are like two sides of a
coin, you can’t get a coin with a heads
side but no tails. Subscription fees
for online gaming certainly make it
seem that you can actually find coins
with only one side in this world…
