It is not widely known that George Orwell’s 1984
and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World owe their
inspiration to a relatively unknown Russian writer,
Yevgeny Zamyatin. In 1924 the manuscript of an
extraordinary book was smuggled out of post-
revolutionary Russia and published in the West. We
described the slow awakening of citizen D-503, an
engineer in the apparently utopian One State. The
urban nation is made entirely from glass to facilitate
surveillance and its citizens cultivate a dispassionate
preoccupation in maximising productive efficiency.
D-503 is tortured and confused as he finds himself
falling in love, a cardinal sin under the regime.
Zamyatin’s writing is a heavily satirical response
to his own youthful Bolshevik sympathies and
his experience of the Tyne shipyards during the
First World War. The book, with its subversive
commentary, had the dubious honour of being the
first ever to be banned by the Soviet censorship
bureau. Zamyatin was exiled from Russia and, like
all great authors, died in poverty and obscurity in
Paris in 1937. However, his work lived on and its
importance to 20th Century dystopian literature
cannot be understated. We is a short but surprisingly
complex book and I highly recommend reading it for
its poignancy, wit and intelligence.

Meredith Thomas picks:
The years continued to roll on,
expanding until my childhood
reverie waned.
Ireland continued to be a panacea
of opportunity. By 2008 Dad had
replaced the BMW with a Range
Rover. It consumed the driveway
with its girth.
I remember being gathered
around the television. The Madines
were having a quiet night in for
Joe’s nineteenth birthday. Mammy
nursed our new sister Eithne in her
lap. Dad’s hair was untidy and his tie
was crooked. He never left the office
now.
“Almost forgot,” he said, passing
me a copy of CarSport magazine.
With Joe looking over my shoulder
I began to flick through the pages.
A poster slipped out from the
magazine’s spine. Unfolding it
revealed the most the most garish car
I had ever laid eyes on. Its crenulated
wheel spokes grinned at me from the
glossy page. The spoiler protruded
like the hilt of a blade from its
scabbard. To me, in that moment,
a sword and a car were one and
the same. When wielded properly
both became an extension of the
hand. With enthusiastic conviction I
showed the poster to Dad.
I announced that it would be my
first car. Joe nodded his head in
agreement.
Dad contorted his face and
whistled before replying,
“Now lads, if you’re looking a
Nissan Skyline, you’d need to start
saving.”
“Right then, we will, won’t we
Shane?” said Joe, poking fun. “You
didn’t always have a fast car, Dad.
You have to start somewhere.”
“And you won’t have a roof over
your heads much longer, if you don’t
watch it lads,” retorted Dad.
“We might as well aim high,” I said.
“Sure, everybody’s at it.”
Dad stole a glance at my mother.
His eyes were red and raw. He looked
unnerved as he chided me, “No more
of that talk out of you.” He took out
a cigarette and left the room. The
buoyant atmosphere had collapsed.
The baby began to whimper over
the knell of the television, “…as
Dublin house prices continue to
fall.”

Mickey Bishop gave us work as a
mechanic on weekends. I worked
incessantly, leaving and returning in
total darkness. Sitting in school on
Monday mornings I was aware of my
hands. They would be smeared in oil,
my fingers throbbing. I’d tell myself
it was worth the effort. Everything
had its price.
Joe and I would count the money
on Sunday evenings and place it
into a glass jar which we concealed
beneath a loose floorboard.
One Friday I arrived home from
work. The kitchen light was still on.
Dad was visible through the frosted
glass, hunched over the table with
his head bowed. I went in. He barely
acknowledged me. His stubble was
thick, his face thin. The acrid smell
of whiskey filled the room. He spoke
with a brusque tone.
“Dan Harrington didn’t turn up to
work. His won’t answer the phone. I
was relying on one of his contracts
to cover my costs.”
“Have you got enough to cover it?”
I asked.
He snapped “Get you to bed!”
bringing his fist down hard on the
table on the final word.
A chill ran up my spine as I left
the kitchen. As I climbed the stairs
my spirits were doused by a sense of
foreboding. Falling into bed I looked
through the skylight. A thick veil of
cloud masked the stars.
That evening stands out in my
memory. It was like a rug pulled
from beneath our feet. With each day
thereafter the lives of the Madines
began to shatter and fall.
***
We shared our fate with many
others as the fabric of Ireland’s
destiny swiftly unravelled. Dad put
the car up for sale. Nobody was
interested. Mickey Bishop turned up
the following Sunday. “Dan’s done a
runner, Aodhán,” he said as he drew
on a cigarette. No one ever smoked
in the house. Dad said nothing. His
face said it all. Mickey continued.
“No one has had word of him for
three days.”
Dad finally mustered a reply,
fighting tears.
“I have the largest stake in the
business…I’m liable.”
From then on he spent his time
on the phone. He demanded
payments and defended his own.
The bills slowly amassed beneath the
letterbox. I walked into the kitchen
one evening to find him facing my
mother. Tears ran down her cheeks.
“We’ve three mouths to feed. You
can’t touch our savings Aodhán,” she
said.
“If I don’t stay liquid, we’ll lose
everything. I’ve no choice, Sarah.”
The silence that followed was
shattered by the doorbell. A voice
rang out, “We need our wages,
Aodhán!”
Dad turned towards me, “Get rid
of them, Shane.” In that moment I
knew that his business was beyond
saving. That car was my last ray of
hope.
***
Guarantee day was the final nail
in the coffin. Joe and I had taken
Granda Michael out for a pint to
celebrate our earnings. We’d raised
just shy of three thousand euros
in eight months. Walking home
Granda slapped us both on the
back as we rounded the corner.
Dad was smoking on the doorstep.
The glow of his cigarette danced
in the darkness like a crosshair…
and by God he was shaking like a
hunted man. Barely able to stand, he
followed us inside.
Mammy was bawling her eyes out
in the sitting room. The lights were
out and the television cast dancing
shadows on the wall. Eithne was
curled up in the corner. Granda went
to her and picked her up.
“What now?” asked Joe. Mammy
took a moment to gather herself.
“The banks rejected your father’s
application for a loan. The business
is dead.”
Granda Michael winced as though
he’d been struck across the face. He
turned to face my father.
“No, Aodhán, no…What about the
men under you? What about their
children?”
Joe sank into the sofa and bit his
lip. I couldn’t move. Mammy clasped
her knees to her chest and closed her
Raw Words: Part Two
The second installment of Eoghan Totten’s short story
eyes as she spoke.
“They’re on their own. Our savings
are gone. The mortgage is two
months in arrears.”
It was difficult to watch Granda
suffer as he relived hardships he
thought were confined to the past.
He kept whispering “This isn’t
happening” over and over. In that
moment I realised that nothing is
sacred, that all hope can die and
every dream be pillaged. I knew what
I had to do. Climbing the stairs I
entered Joe’s room. My tears started
as I lifted the floorboard. Joe jumped
up when I came back with the glass
jar in my arms.
“No, Shane,” he said as he reached
out and touched the jar.
Dad moved for the first time in
those long minutes. Sweat glistened
on his forehead. The sinews on his
withered temple twitched. He licked
his lips and asked, “How much?”
I replied “Three thousand.”
He paced across the room with his
hands extended. I gave him the jar.
He cradled it in his arms.
“We’ll have a roof over our heads,”
he whispered. “For now.”
He dropped like a stone to the
floor. His moans were like that of
a wounded animal. Granda bent
down to him, placed one hand on
Dad’s cheek and kissed his forehead.
He held Eithne close with the other
hand. Joe gave Mammy’s shoulder a
reassuring squeeze…and I watched
as my family was brought to its
knees.
The image of my father gripping
that jar of money will stay with me
forever. He had been humbled in
front of his wife, his children, even
his father. In that moment he had no
choice but to extinguish the dreams
of his children. His business had
been ravished by economic rot, a
plague that would smother our lives
for many years to come. Things
never returned to the way they were.
In a way, I never left that sitting
room.
I used to wonder who was to
blame. I’d spend hours harbouring
thoughts of revenge that ricocheted
back and forth in my mind, when
one day I simply stopped. It didn’t
matter. A myriad of higher powers
had ploughed the soil of Ireland
and when it became sterile they got
out when they could. Things went
forward until they failed. When the
crash hit we had to bear a financial
cross whose shared load would break
the backs of millions…and there’d be
no relief.
Now, I lament what followed. The
death of friendships spawned family
feuds. Dan Harrington abandoned
my father. He in turn had no choice
but to abandon those workers who
had put their trust in him. Mickey
Bishop never calls. Dad is dead
inside. We can never look beyond
tomorrow.
Dad was right. There was a price to
pay for everything. Now, we’re for-
ever in debt.

Maciej Matuszewski talks about London’s
first comedy book festival
Chortle Festival
Dear Dan Brown
Robert Finn
The bestselling author Dan Brown has
thrilled and infuriated readers in equal
measure. With outlandish plots, insipid
prose and wilful and repeated misuse of
the word ‘facts’, it is somehow difficult
to see how he ever managed to get
published in first place. Despite all of
this the author has somehow managed
to amass a legion of loyal fans. Up-and-
coming comedian Robert Finn, however,
was not afraid to brave these fans’ wrath
in this scathing and vitriolic critique of
Brown’s writing skills.
First performed at last year’s Edinburgh
Fringe to broadly positive reviews, the
show was in the form of an open letter
to Brown from a struggling prospective
author. This was certainly an interesting
show, combining both good humour
and fascinating insight into the oft
misunderstood publishing industry and
the process of writing a novel. While
certainly not for fans of Dan Brown, this
was a very enjoyable hour for people
interested in books and writing.
Finn is certainly a name to look out for in
the future.
The Trade Secret
Rob Newman
Rob Newman first made his name in the
1980s as a stand-up comedian working
with David Baddiel. However, in more
recent years he has managed to successfully
re-brand himself as a popular novelist. His
latest book, The Trade Secret, is a historical
novel set at the start of the seventeenth
century. The novel follows two friends as
they attempt to discover a hidden oil well
under the abandoned Temple of Mithras in
Persia.
Based on a true story that Newman found
in the Rare Books Room of the British
Library, this looks to be an exciting globe
trotting adventure, taking place in England,
Persia and Italy.
Speaking at the Festival, Newman made
clear how the book was born from the deep
interest he has in this period. He spoke of
how the events that that he writes about
marked the beginning of the modern age
and how they have an impact on the world’s
geopolitical situation even to this day.
While I don’t normally read historical
fiction, I might be tempted to check this
one out.
The Simpsons and their
Mathematical Secrets
Simon Singh
Much has already been said on these pages
about Imperial alumnus’ Simon Singh’s
latest work, which explores the hidden
mathematical depths of the popular
cartoons The Simpsons and Futurama.
In his festival show, one of a series of
promotional appearances for the book
taking place around the country, Singh
aimed to give a brief outline of what the
book is all about.
It turns out that the writers of these shows
are surprisingly mathematically literate,
with one even leaving a maths PhD to
join the writing team. As such, a standard
episode is usually filled with mathematical
references – some obvious, many others far
more subtle. Singh has clearly put in a lot of
research to identify even the most obscure
of these.
During his talk Singh showed how he was
clearly very passionate about the subject
matter – with his sheer joy about working
on a book that combines both The Simpsons
and maths never failing to show through.
This seems to be a book to look for.
I really wasn’t sure what to expect from
the Chortle Comedy Books Festival – an
event hosted by the comedy news website
Chortle. After all, what would such an
event even entail? It turns out that I
needn’t have worried. The festival was an
eclectic mix of comedy shows related to
books and discussions of books written
by high profile comedians.
With a host of different comedians and
other speakers ranging from Richard
Herring to Shappi Khorsandi and Robin
Ince, there was something here for
everybody. Taking place in the August
surroundings of Ealing Town Hall, some
events were packed and boisterous while
others were more sparsely attended –
allowing for a more intimate discussion
between the speaker and the audience.
All in all, this was a very enjoyable
experience, with the talks, in general,
being both witty and interesting. I
recommend that you look out for future
comedy events hosted by Chortle.
