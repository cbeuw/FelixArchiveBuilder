Our International Students
T
he Immigration Bill was
announced on October
10, 2013 and is currently
moving through Parliament
and it is due to have one final
reading in the House of Commons
before moving on to the House of
Lords in the new year. A survey was
put to international students earlier
this month to canvas opinion on these
issues, and the results of this survey
were used to form a paper presented
to Union Council by Marissa
Lewis, Deputy President (Welfare)
on November 12. It was passed
unanimously, meaning the Union’s
stance on this issue is clear: we oppose
any policy that would adversely affect
our international students.
There are two proposals in the
Immigration Bill in particular which
affect international students – the first
is the introduction of an NHS fee of up
to £200 per year of study, paid before
entry into the country. For doctoral
research students with families, this
could add up to £3000 to their costs
of studying in the UK. Although
there is a persistent stereotype that
all international students are rich,
51% of students claimed it would be a
financial struggle to pay this levy.
The second proposal is introducing
a fine to any private landlord who
doesn’t check the immigration status
of their tenants, raising fears that
landlords would simply refuse to rent
to international students to save them
the time and bother. With 29% of
international students already saying
their fee status makes it difficult to
rent accommodation, this change may
further restrict access to safe, high
quality housing.
One of the most shocking findings
of the survey was that the proposed
changes would have discouraged
60% of international students
from applying to Imperial College
London. In the face of an increasingly
competitive global market for higher
education, the changes could be
catastrophic to Imperial as we rely
on international students and staff to
maintain our status as one of the top
universities in the world.
Since passing through Council, the
successful paper has been making its
way through College. Marissa Lewis,
Deputy President (Welfare) presented
the paper to the Vice Provost’s
Advisory Group (Education) and,
as a result, has gained the support
of Professor Denis Wright, Director
of Student Support and Sharon
Bolton, Head of International Student
Support. Professor Debra Humphries,
Vice Provost (Education) is also
including the text of the paper in her
regular report to the Provost Board
taking place today.
The Union is joining with the
national campaign of students’
unions from across the UK to call
on Parliament to allow international
students to be exempted from these
proposals. The next step being taken is
to lobby the House of Lords, where the
Bill will next be debated. The Union is
calling for students to add their voices
to an open letter to the members of
the House of Lords (pictured) who
have ties with Imperial. Students can
also support the National Union of
Students’ campaign by signing their
petition and writing to their local MP
using an online form.
Whether you are an international
student or someone who recognises
that international students provide
our College with a wealth of talent and
diversity that we should be protecting,
you can find out details of how to get
involved with the campaign here:
