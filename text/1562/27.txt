you’re an arsehole.

Assad Proves That All Medics Are Tossers
F
ollowing a vote on an
unnamed and inferior
Imperial news source
in which Bashar Al-
Assad was tying with
Jack Hewitt as “Worst Allumus”,
it is obvious that the President of
Syria is the living embodiment
of the Medic Student’s mentality.
Sources have confirmed the many of
the traits expressed by former Imperial
Medic, Bashar Al-Assad – arrogance,
I
t was revealed this week
that the Science Challenge
2014 will be placed under
direct surveillance by MI5.
Staating that the free expression
allowed by the Science Challenege
was an “immediate and real threat
to the state” the security services
immediately assigned their top
agent, codename Baroness Eliza
Manningham-Buller
“The RCSU’s Science Challenge posed
a sustained threat since its inception
in 2006” said an MI5 spokesperson.
“Indeed, with notorious figures such
as “Deparment Destroyer” Dallman,
Pallab “Killing Machine” Ghosh and
Sir Keith O’Nions AKA Sir Keith
Onions AKA The Onion Knight it
would be unwise to leave this event
unsupervised”.
At press time, Professor Lord “High
Executioner” Robert Winston had
retreated to an unspecified safehouse
until the relevant figures could be
bribed.
obstinancy, isolationism, forming a
minority sect with a inflated sense of
self-importance – are shared by the
average Imperial medical student.
These traits, which can be summarised
with the single derogatory word
“tosser” are common to both the
dictator of Syria and pretty much
every one of the roughly 3,000 medical
students.
This reporter is surely not alone in
recognising the irony that a profession
which should attract thoughtful,
caring peopl who want to contribute
meaningfully to the world actually

This week you go to the Union’s
‘SPIN’ event in Metric. You
misinterpret the highly detailed
poster and turn up with a spin
bike in your favourite leotard.
Everyone stares as you cycle
but fuck it, you’ve already
lugged the damn this far.
This week you return to the
Beit Quad to find the family of
Sainsburys trolleys that you
dumped the previous week.
You turn them on their sides
and see how long they stay
in the Quad until somebody
actually does something
about them.
This week you forget to send
in your carefully planned
horoscopes and instead the
Editor calls for people to
submit their own!
This week the oft-neglected
videos of the Sabbs turn out to
be Weeping Angels. Shit!
You close your eyes and count
to ten, only to find that they
still appear in your mind’s eye,
reaching out towards you in
their branded garb.
This week, you finally find the
cleaning equipment in your
halls. Except the mice have
already got to it and chewed
off all the useful parts. You
forlornly attempt to sweep
your floor with the remaining
wooden stump.
This week you pick up Felix
to find that there are two
centrefolds in the middle of the
paper! Win! As you head into
lectures mesmerised by the
disrespectful filth, you forget
to look before you cross the
road and accidentally step on
the stinger of a large scorpion.
Run!
This week you walk through
Sherfield only to have a sobbing
student fling themselves at you,
spilling your freshly bought
coffee down your shirt. As you
scream and flail from the minor
burns you receive they flop to the
floor, looking at you with disdain.
They don’t even apologise as
you stagger towards first aid.
Dickhead!
Having protested at the vulgarity
in your last horoscope, you open
the paper full of fresh hopes and
dreams only to find that you have
the most horrific horoscope you
could ever imagine. Stunned,
you stumble towards the nearest
person and cry into their arms.
Unfortunately they are not so
impressed and throw you to the
floor. What a dickhead!
This week you attend a fancy
dress party wearing nothing
but the representation of your
star sign. As you try to explain
your costume’s significance
to the simpletons in residence
you realise the futility of your
attempts and resign your-
self to a life in law. [Wait, that
could be positive- H].
Then you eventually die.
This week you forget to write
horoscopes for Hangman. S/
He gets very annoyed, which is
never a good thing. When you
wake up you discover an angry
geek in your room.
You leave campus at 2AM
again, and as you walk down
Queensgate you watch a
car race up and down the
road throwing newspapers at
different buildings. As you stare
in amazement, the car comes
towards you and starts pelting
you with newspapers. As you
run screaming you trip and are
covered by a mountain of paper.
You’re crossing the road when
suddenly you hear a swoosh.
Looking behind you see a
dark shape flying the sky. As
you run desperately, the giant
Burger King swoops down
and takes you to his castle!

G
ibralatar, UK –
Following numeous
antagonist moves from
Spain, this editor fully
advocates forgetting
the last 68 years of relative European
peace and declaring war on Spain.
Essentially, Spain is clearly asking
for it. No one searches a diplomatic
bag without wishing to intentionally
prompt an immediate millitary
response. And moving ships into
another country’s territorial waters,
that’s pretty much calling for a fully-
fledged, all-out nuclear response.
Indeed, it is disgraceful that, thus
far, our only response has been to
summon the Spanish Ambassador to
the Foreign Office. This writer believes
the time for diplomacy had already
long passed and that the matter should
have immediately been referred to the
Ministry of Defence.
Thankfully, the Spanish tactic to
attempt to hypnotise the entire nation
through the world’s most boring and
rythmic football has failed. following
Spain’s deserved thrashing at the
Confederations Cup in Brazil.
The football alone would’ve been a
sufficient Casus Belli, however these
petulant acts of aggressive are the last
straw.
Therefore, this editor suggests our
Parliament declares immediate and
unrestricted war. So, sign up for the
reserves; black out your windows;
ratio your food; punch a local Spainard
because war it is.

T
he abysmal defeat of the
England cricket team at the
hands of their Australian
counterparts has this week
confirmed that, as well
as football, England were also fairly
terrible at cricket.
After the roaring success of the
Olympics and other British and
English sporting successes in recent
years, it was, in some way, perversely
comforting to know that England
are still pretty fucking bad at two
international sports.
With any luck, an abysmal showing
by England at the World Cup next
summer, coupled with a resounding
defeat in the Ashes will restore fan
faith.
“Or Maybe Worse; Perhaps Just The Same”
A
fter the publication of a
650-page White Paper
entitled “Scotland’s
Future”, analysts are
unsure of the effect
Scottish Independence would have on
Scotland.
“Well it may well be really beneficial
as Alex Salmond dreams” started
one expert, before continuing “on the
other hand it could be really bad”.
“Or nothing much will change at all.
Who the fuck knows?”
The myriad of issues from defence
to who gets the UKs oil fields are
covered extensively in the report
but essentially there is no way to
know whether the result will be an
improved, deteriorated or basically
the same Scotland.
“Until Scotland becomes independent,
we will pretty much just be making
random stabs in the dark as to whether
the Pound or the Euro woud be the
preferable currency for Scotland.”
“I mean, we have to remember that all
this is probably a moot point anyway
given that support for independence is
currently polling at around 25%”
Most experts, however, were
completely unaware that Scotland
existed at all and most that did were
unwilling to mention that uncivilised
place.

sorted out the mess left by the Roman Empire 300 years
earlier, Charlemagne also sorted out the Papacy but unfor-
tunately didn’t have enough time to sort out Muslim Iberia.
