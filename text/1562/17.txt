N
ew for this year, we will be
putting on a whole fair of
science demonstrations during
registration before the talk. A
variety of examples of science
and engineering will be on show, with props
contributed by departments and student
organisations at Imperial College.
We are especially pleased to announce that
the Department of Chemistry, in association
with ChemSoc, will have a whole range of live
chemical experiments taking place.
Take this opportunity to make yourself
comfortable and enjoy the show. Our
volunteers will be present to ensure that any
questions you may have can be answered in a
prompt and friendly manner.
Promptly at 7:00PM we will take you to our
large and modern lecture theatre where you
can take your seats and get comfortable, as
we have a few brief talks by our judges and
distinguished guest speaker.
We wholly encourage you to bring your
phones and cameras, and we’d love for you to
tweet at the event, the hashtag is #scichal. We
look forward to welcoming you on Tuesday.
A
s always, we will have a few
tickets to the Final up for grabs:
all you’ll need to do is solve our
little brainteaser. Bring your
calculators and pens (don’t
worry, we’ll provide paper) if you want to get
a place at the Final without answering any of
the questions.
You can, of course, win your place at the final
in the traditional method of making an award-
winning entry. The questions for your essay or
video will be announced at the Launch.
Book your free Launch ticket now! Students from all faculties welcome.
