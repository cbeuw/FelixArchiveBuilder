SCIENCE CHALLENGE
What is the Science Challenge?
T
he Science Challenge is the
RCSU’s annual competition.
It’s the perfect opportunity
for you to communicate
science in an engaging,
concise and fun manner. Four high
profile judges will set three essay
questions and a task for a video
category.
Every year the selected judges give
up their time to talk at the launch
and grand final events, and chose
the overall winners. They are leaders
in their fields: academia, science,
journalism and business. Last year
the Director of Grantham Institute for
Climate Change, Professor Sir Brian
Hoskins, judged one question. The
year before Wellcome Trust Head of
Communications and former Science
Editor of the Times Mark Henderson
was involved.
The Science Challenge is generously
sponsored: previous winners have
received tours of CERN in Switzerland
and big cash prizes. All Imperial
students can enter the competition,
regardless of faculty, as well as
students from any secondary school
in the country.
Ultimately the Science Challenge
is here to make the scientists of
tomorrow stop and think about
the problems that affect society as
a whole, and how their scientific
prowess can help resolve them. But
importantly, to also think about how
to best communicate the science that
affects people’s daily lives to a wider
audience, not necessary of the same
scientific inclination as them.
Just in case you were wondering, the
Science Challenge is open for all at
Imperial College, and school students.
No matter what faculty you are in, you
are more than welcome! Professor Lord Robert Winston speaks at a previous RCSU Science Challenge Launch
What’s in it for you?
We are keeping this year’s prizes kept under lock
and key, so you’ll need to come to the launch to
find out! Here’s what was on offer last year, just to
whet your appetite!

What’s the Launch?
W
hen you
have a huge
c o m p e t i t i o n ,
there’s only one
way to get it
started, and that’s with a huge launch
event. And in true RCSU tradition, we
pack plenty into the Science Challenge
Launch. However, this doesn’t detract
away from the key detail of unveiling
the questions, prizes, and venue of the
Science Challenge Final.
This year the RCSU Science
Challenge Launch will take place in
the Sir Alexander Fleming building,
where there are plenty of activities
planned for the evening, as detailed
on the back page. Importantly, you
will get an exclusive chance to meet
the people who will be setting and
marking this year’s questions.
The RCSU has also, with thanks to
the Outreach Office, invited GCSE
and A-Level students from schools
around London and the rest of the UK
to the Launch. The Science Challenge
is just as much about testing the
communication skills of tomorrow’s
scientists as it is about testing the
skills of today’s students.

Vaccines – the Art of War
In our struggle against infectious
diseases, battles have been won but the
war is far from over.
T
wo hundred years of work
has transformed Edward
Jenner’s first vaccination
experiments into a legacy
that has eradicated
smallpox, reduced polio infection by
99% and measles by 74%. Millions of
people, and their descendants, now
exist because of this.
However, these victories exist in the
shadow of those threats which remain.
Pathogens such as HIV, influenza
virus and Hepatitis C virus represent
more complicated foes, able to evolve
beyond our existing techniques.
Fresh innovation is required – a
battleplan is needed.
Gathering Intelligence
Without information, the war is
already lost. Understanding each
pathogen’s journey, through one host
and into the next, can reveal its most
vulnerable moments – our windows
of opportunity.
Achieving this requires a strong
foundation of research – particularly
the existence models for studying
pathogens at the lab bench, rather
than in patients. Some diseases, such
as Hepatitis C have proven challenging
to grow in the lab, slowing efforts to
study them.
Progress is being made in this
area, but each discovery reveals new
questions. By improving our tools we
inch closer to spotting that chink in
the armour, and exploiting it.
Selecting a Target
The right target makes all the differ-
ence. Vaccines are typically designed
around a marker, called an epitope,
selected from the outside of an invad-
ing pathogen. This trains the immune
system to rapidly recognise and neu-
tralise the invader, a vital head-start in
battle.
Picking the right epitope is essen-
tial – it will be the calling card of the
invader that the immune system re-
members. However, successful patho-
gens often have a high rate of change
in their DNA as they replicate – creat-
ing populations with a huge range of
slightly different epitopes even within
a single infected individual.
Pathogens such as HIV use this
ability to create a constantly shifting
battlefield – altering their epitopes
to reset their recognisability. This
constant guerrilla warfare keeps the
pathogen hidden, and the immune
system guessing.
Current research is overcoming
this problem using shrewd selection,
rather than brute force. Avoiding the
obvious epitopes which can easily be
changed, researchers are selecting
areas which the pathogen needs to
keep fixed in order to maintain its
infectivity. This puts the pathogen
in a lose-lose situation – either get
recognised, or become less infectious.
With the target selected, an
appropriate weapon is required.
In the Armoury
Vaccines are not all alike. We know
the body creates different types
of immune response according to
the pathogen encountered, and a
successful vaccine needs to support
the correct reaction.
Early vaccines have taught us many
lessons – early HIV vaccines failed
due to ineffective immune responses
being made. The latest vaccines aim to
create subtly-tuned and overlapping
immune responses, best designed to
repel the target.
We also need to think about how
to deliver the vaccine – existing
techniques using dead pathogens, or
extracted epitopes are not sufficient.
New ideas include using raw DNA
to immunise people, or exposing
immune cells outside the body before
reintroducing them.
Counter-Insurgency
Despite best intentions, our immune
systems can sometimes be misdirected
by invading pathogens.
Research has shown that during
HIV infection, one of our own
immune sentinel cells unwittingly
carries HIV from the entry site all the
way to its target, deep inside the body.
Such hijacking allows HIV to bypass
the dangers of making this journey
alone, protecting it from the immune
system.
When planning our intervention,
we need to allow for the failings in our
own natural response and fill these
gaps with carefully designed support.
Once incorporating these features, a
vaccine can be readied for deployment
in the field.
Campaign strategy
A powerful vaccine is only a tool,
and one that still needs to be applied
correctly.
Tomaximisethelife-savingpotential
of vaccine, we must prioritise those
groups of people who are most at risk,
catching the pathogen at a bottleneck
and reducing its dispersal. The spread
of disease, influenced by factors such
as urbanisation and global travel, is
studied by the branch of science called
epidemiology which can guide the use
of a new vaccine.
Epidemiologists can advise on how
previous vaccination strategies have
work, and how local conditions such
as lifestyles, diets and even other
existing diseases can change the way
a vaccine will work. Without this
planning, even a good vaccine can fail
to have the desired effect.
A Winnable War?
Advances are coming, but the
remaining challenges are the hardest.
When fighting these constantly
evolving pathogens, we must evolve
our own tactics in parallel. Success lies
in unifying the advances in all the fields
mentioned, creating effective vaccines
built upon a strong foundation of
knowledge. Our intervention will take
place in an already chaotic natural
battlefield between a pathogen and
our immune system, so understanding
both belligerents is critical to lending
useful support.
The challenge of understanding this
chaos should not deter us, but give us
hope for success –
“In the midst of chaos, there is also
opportunity”
