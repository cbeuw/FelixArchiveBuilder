Imperial XC rock the Brighton 10k
Sunday 17th November saw 41 club
members brave a very early start to
descend on Brighton for the 10k.
With perfectly cool and still weather
conditions on the seafront optimism
was high amongst the group to come
away with some PBs to savour.
Owing to some rather inconvenient
rail engineering works, the group had
to assemble at Victoria station at the
rather anti-social 6.10am, so early that
not even the tubes had started to run.
This led to the day beginning with a
highly creative club peloton across
Chelsea Embankment, whilst others
opted for the night bus choosing to
save their legs for the 10 kilometres to
come.
Despite the early hour, only one
competitor was missing (presumed
asleep) as the train set off into the
sunrise.
With an elongated train journey en-
route to the race, the team had plenty
of time to catch up on some must
needed sleep, breakfast and face paint-
ing! There was even time for a song
for birthday boy Ed Hallet, whose pre-
sent was a rather skimpy size 6 vest to
wear in the race. The scenic route did
limit time to arrive at the start though.
But, following a brisk march led by the
captain yielding the club vuvuzela in
the air, and a precarious bag drop at
the alumni’s car the team made it to
the start line with barely any time to
spare!
Over 2,000 runners took part in the
event, but despite this the club had
top 25 finishers in both the men’s and
women’s races. Returning from inju-
ry, Chris Bannon acted as pacemaker
for the term’s star male athlete Liam
Smith, with both runners staying side
by side until the last km with Ban-
non going to finish in 33.17 (21st) and
Smith in 33.25 (22nd), a huge person-
al best for Liam. Some say that Liam
owes Chris many drinks for the rest of
the year… James Ellis also joined the
paced train for the first 4km and held
on to run 34.55, a huge personal best.
Just behind, Milan Misak ripped up
the form book with one of the team’s
most animalistic runs of the day with
35.39, more than 4 minutes off his
previous best.
He just held off Charlie Houston
(35.45) who had the better of club sec-
retary Matt Douthwaite (36.18) and
Clement Jambou (36.20).
In the women’s race, the club’s stel-
lar summer signing Imo Simmonds
once again impressed running 38.58
to take 12th in the women’s race,
which would have made the top 200
in the men’s race! This followed a 4th
place in the London Colleges League
earlier in the week, the best result by
an Imperial lady for 4 years! She led
back Sophie Kirk (42.40) and Imogen
Keane (43.29), showing that Imogen
proves to be a fast name in ICXC!
Sarah Twaite and Barbara Hollinger
were next making impressive club de-
buts with 46.33 and 46.35 with Antoi-
nette Hardijzer also taking a PB with
47.42.
After the race, there was the neces-
sary pose for a seafront photo, con-
sumption of club baking and a trip
to a local fish and chips restaurant.
Some of the group then headed back,
but other continued visiting some
of Brighton’s watering holes, before
stocking up on some essentials before
the early evening banter train back to
Victoria.
Altogether it proved to be a Super
Sunday for the club, with a terrific
turnout, personal best performances
and some serious socialising.
Onwards to Stirling for BUCS cham-
pionships in February!

IC CROSS COUNTRY
T
he Imperial Eagles
Handball Club could
celebrate a double
victory over the newly
formed Kings College
Cobras Handball club, with both
the women’s and the men’s team
coming up trumps last Sunday.
The women’s team was play-
ing their first game of the season
in Barking on Sunday, but a late
cancellation forced them to com-
pensate and improvise a great deal
if they wanted to defeat Kings Col-
lege on the day. “We don’t have a
great deal of depth this season, but
starting a game with one player
less is something that we wanted
to avoid at all cost.” said Natalia
Couto Francisco, team captain of
the women’s squad. “On the other
hand, it really focused our minds
and helped us to ensure we use
every spell of possession to the
best of our abilities!” She laughed
after the encounter.
In the first 20 minutes, Kings
College tried hard to demoralise
the Eagles and get plenty of goals
between the teams. However, Im-
perial never looked likely to let
that happen and cleverly shifted
their defense in order to adapt
to their opponents’ shooters in
the centre positions. A necessary
consequence of this was that the
attackers on the wing would find
themselves with more space, but
the Cobras struggled to capitalise
on the space and numerical advan-
tage.
In attack, Imperial’s women
played their waves effectively and
without conceding many turno-
vers, which helped them create op-
portunities to take promising shots
on goal. The Cobra’s goalkeeper
and her unusual technique proved
difficult to overcome, but by the in-
terval the score was 5:12 in favour
of Imperial.
In the second half, the Cobras’
defense tried to disrupt the Ea-
gles’ attack by marking their centre
player. After an initial success and
reducing the deficit by 2 goals, Im-
perial’s women’s team shifted their
play onto the wing and continued
their fine scoring run. Throughout
the second 30 minutes of the match,
the leaders managed to hold on to
their advantage and secured their
first victory with a goal difference of
+8.
Earlier that day, the Imperial Ea-
gles men’s team had to face the Co-
bras in Kings’ first ever competitive
game. Imperial have learned to not
underestimate new teams after their
close encounter with Royal Hollo-
way 2 weeks previously and started
with a strong team. Due to a low
turnout, Kings was allowed to add
some girls players on the bench in
order to support their starting seven
and increase their depth. In the first
15 minutes, the Cobras struggled
to trouble the Eagles’ defense and
only two careless moments by Ste-
fan Bauer spared them the embar-
rassment of ending a half without
having scored. On the other side of
the court, the inexperienced Cobras
showed a lot of will and spirit and
tried stay on top of their opponents,
but Imperials unique mixture of fast
counter-attacks, skillfully crafted
schemes like “Wurst” and “Heidi”,
and their individual brilliance meant
that Kings would find themselves
trailing by 25:2 at half time. All hope
for the second half was lost when the
Kings College goalkeeper was red-
carded for flooring Imperials Ruben
Freytag in the middle of a counter-
attack a few minutes before the in-
terval. After a partially sloppy dis-
play by Imperial in the second half,
they came away with a 42:10 victory.
Club president Rishi De-Kayne,
who was unable to attend either fix-
ture, was rumored to have danced in
celebration upon hearing the excel-
lent news. He later said that “I am so
happy for both teams, but especially
the girls’! To win the first game of the
season despite being a player short is
a remarkable achievement.”
This week’s clashes see the girls
battle it out against UCL, who are
favourites for the league title this
years, and the men’s team is set to
play Brunel University, who put in
an impressive performance against
Middlesex University on the open-
ing day of the season.
