Felix Arts talks to MSc student and Artifact
founder and Co-Chair Meredith Thomas
Each year, scientists from Imperial
College and artists from the Royal
College of Art join forces to create
inspiring, innovative and interesting
works of art under the scheme Artifact.
Closet artist and Imperial student
Meredith Thomas told Felix Arts all
about it.
What is Artifact?
Artifact is a project I set up three years
ago now, at the end of 2010, and the
idea behind it was to try and promote
some kind of social interaction and
integration between the Royal College
of Art (RCA) and Imperial College. It’s
very strange because they’re so close
and yet they don’t really talk at all.
[RCA is located behind Beit Quad, next
to the Royal Albert Hall.]
What inspired you to set it up?
I think it was the fact that I’ve always
enjoyed art, and it was a bit of a wrench
for me to come to Imperial. I spent
most of my first year hoping I’d fail
so I’d have an excuse to go and do an
Art Foundation course! I also saw that
there were a lot of students at Imperial
who liked art but kind of felt like they
had to supress it, because they couldn’t
really use it or because it wasn’t that
relevant to their studies.
Do you have an artistic background
yourself?
Well, I always did art qualifications
outside of school. I did an Art GCSE
and a Graphic Design A Level at a
further education college – although I
got a U in Graphic Design…!
Why do you think it’s important
to have something like Artifact at
Imperial?
I think mostly because there’s a
demand for it. I basically see myself as a
facilitator.IknowthattheRCAstudents
are gagging to have interaction with
scientists, and I know that for a lot of
the PhD students, and undergraduates,
they really want to be able to talk about
their science, and they want to see it
represented in interesting ways.
I actually don’t like a lot of ‘Art
Science’
, a lot of it’s terrible. But I want
to give people the opportunity. You
find that some quite fantastic things
emerge sometimes when you just give
people the opportunity.
Do you think it’s been a success so
far?
The first year we ran it, I think it went
quite well, given that it was a standing
start; we had an exhibition of about
seven pieces, and some of those
pieces were beautiful. The last couple
of years it’s been a bit up and down I
think, so I’m using this year to take
up the scheme again and really push
it forward, and hopefully leave a big
legacy before I finally leave Imperial!
Have you thought about including
the Royal College of Music (RCM) as
well?
We have! It doesn’t fit very well into
the format, but it would be nice to
have a really solid year and then to
start expanding the scheme. We had
the Courtauld Institute involved last
year, who are a small art history place
at Somerset House. But it would be
really nice to extend this to the RCM,
yes. I’m not sure how we would fit any
emerging collaborations into a gallery
though – I guess we’d have to have a
think!
How can Imperial students get
involved in this year’s Artifact?
The launch event is Wednesday the
4th December, and it’s going to be
a pub quiz based on art and science
questions. We’re going to force you
together into teams with artists and
scientists and hopefully it will be quite
fun. You’ll have a chance to talk to
artists and start to maybe suggest ideas.
We’ll then have a series of events
throughout the start of next term, and
you can come along to any of them, and
try and find someone who’s perfect for
you to collaborate with!
Do you have to have a background in
art to get involved?
It’s definitely, definitely not essential.
Almost, almost, possibly, you could say
that it would help if you didn’t.
What kinds of artworks have been
producedinpreviouscollaborations?
I think my all-time favourite was an
artwork called Matters of the Heart. It
was a book-binder, who collaborated
with a biomedical scientist. They took
every slice from an MRI scan of the
heart and bound them into a book, so
when you opened the book you would
see cross-sections through the heart,
and when you closed it the whole heart
would be there in ink. It was really,
really gorgeous.
Would each piece normally be
made by one scientist and one RCA
student, or groups?
I think we’re going to leave it open for
people to form any kind of group they
want. Generally pairs normally work
quite well, and it’s easy for people to
form pairs, but if people want to form
groups that’s fine as well.
Finally, what advice would you give
to Imperial students looking to get
more involved in art across campus?
There are lots of outlets, I think, for
artistic students. Obviously, Leonardo
Fine Arts Society. There are quite a
few artists in residence who are worth
talking to, such as Geraldine Cox in
the Physics Department and Gemma
Anderson in Maths. And Artifact, of
course!
Artifact’s first event will be this
Wednesday, 4th December at 7.30pm,
and will take the form of a science and
arts pub quiz in the Royal College of
Art’s college bar. Everyone welcome.
“Fashion is a vampiric thing, it’s the
hoover on your brain. That’s why
I wear the hats, to keep everyone
away from me. They say, “Oh, can I
kiss you?” I say, “No, thank you very
much. That’s why I’ve worn the hat.
Goodbye.
” I don’t want to be kissed by
all and sundry. I want to be kissed by
the people I love.
” – Isabella Blow
A
brand new exhibition
opened at Somerset
house last week,
documenting the life of
the late Isabella Blow; a
ladyhighlyregardedwithinthefashion
industry. Born into the privileged
world of British aristocracy, Blow
is acknowledged with discovering
the likes of Alexander McQueen
and Philip Treacy, along with being
reputed for her own eccentric and
outlandish style. Having grown up
in London, Isabella studied in New
York and later landed a job as an
assistant to the revered editor-in-chief
of American Vogue, Anna Wintour.
Subsequently working for the Sunday
Times style magazine, she progressed
within Tatler until ultimately earning
the role of fashion director.
Isabella Blow: Fashion Galore!
features pieces from her extensive
personal clothing collection, with
items from McQueen and Treacy
along with the likes of Dior, Prada,
Fendi, Givenchy, Manolo Blahnik
and Marni. This is not solely an
exposition of fashion, however, but
also a commemoration of the life of a
complex and colourful lady. Through
the use of video, voice recordings,
letters and books, visitors are given
the opportunity to delve deeply
into Blow’s personal life as well as
witnessing creations typically seen
gracing the covers of high-fashion
magazines.
Blow had a meticulous eye for
talent and, after witnessing the young
Alexander McQueen’s Central Saint
Martins MA fashion show, was swift
in purchasing the entire collection.
The pair developed a close personal
and professional relationship in which
she helped him develop into the
internationally acclaimed designer he
was to become.
The world which she helped
revolutionise, however, would
eventually lead to her downfall.
Daphne Guinness, a close companion
of Blow’s, stated that, “[Blow] was
upset that McQueen didn’t take her
along when he sold his brand to Gucci.
Once the deals started happening, she
fell by the wayside. Everybody else got
contracts, and she got a free dress”.
In addition to her professional
problems, her marriage of 18 years
broke down and she was later
diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She
became severely depressed and
attempted suicide many times, once
breaking both her ankles by throwing
herself from the Hammersmith
Flyover. On May 6th 2007, during a
weekendsocietyparty,Blowexclaimed
that she was going shopping. She
was discovered by her sister on the
bathroom floor after swallowing the
weed-killer Paraquat and exclaimed,
“I’m worried that I haven’t taken
enough”. She died at hospital the
following day.
Admittedly not for everyone,
this exhibition is certainly of great
importance in recognising a lady
responsible for making such a
profound contribution to her field.
Her life, albeit ending prematurely,
was nevertheless full of experiences
and encounters that make this
exhibition so much more than a
superficial array of fashion, but instead
a fascinating and original experience
that demonstrates the talent and flair
of an extraordinary lady.

“Not just an exposition of fashion, this Somerset House exhibition is also
a commemoration of the life of a complex and colourful lady.”
A true modern masterpiece
S
atyagraha has been lauded
as a masterpiece of modern
opera since its premiere in
1980. After witnessing it
for myself, I can’t help but
agree.
This is not a conventional opera
in any way, but an exciting chance
to see what one of the greatest
of contemporary composers has
contributed to the evolving art form.
As such, it’s important to approach
with an open mind; the rewards are
great.
Satyagraha, roughly meaning
‘force-truth’, is the word used to
describe Ghandi’s philosophy of non-
violent resistance, a concept which is
very relevant today. Here there is no
narrative or plot in the conventional
sense; instead we are witness to a
series of scenes which unfold and
explore aspects of Satyagraha, and
Ghandi’s personal journey.
The opera is sung entirely in
Sanskrit, and no subtitles are
provided – except for the occasional
phrase projected on a wall – but this
doesn’t detract, and instead adds
a level of mysticism. Indeed, the
whole performance has a mysticism
to it. Philip Glass’ minimalist score
is entrancing, and the beautiful
imagery presented by Phelim
McDermott’s “skills ensemble” is
equally captivating.
As the sung text consists of
repeated phrases from the Bhagavad
Gita, there is little action; the actors
are often stood still for long periods
and use small but effective gestures to
communicate. Still, a grand sense of
movement, or perhaps of unfolding,
is felt through the happenings on
stage; giant creatures are constructed
from bits of papier-mâché, a bird is
born from sticky tape and a cloudy
sky is magnificently turned clear
blue. Almost every image presented
is strikingly beautiful.
Phillip Glass, icon of the minimalist
movement, has contributed a
magnificent score, its repetition
perfectly suited to the meditative
nature of the work. Yet on a larger
scale it is structured to provide a

great sense of happening, and an
authentic narrative emerges despite
the near-endless repetition. In this
sense the ending is particularly
striking, as a sense of resolution is
remarkably achieved. This is happens
through a broadening of the tempo
and fantastic use of colours in the
orchestra. Meanwhile at other points
dynamism and momentum are
created through syncopated rhythms
and odd compound timings.
The orchestra, under Stuart
Stratford, handles all this with great
discipline, stamina and occasionally
flair, as does the choir, whose endless
staccato repetitions are impressively
carried. A great deal of work has
obviously gone into balancing the
orchestra with the singers on stage,
as they are almost always perfectly
audible and their words clear.
Outstanding among these is Alan
Oke in the role of Ghandi, who sings
with a tenderness befitting the great
man. The rest of the cast is superb,
although Clare Eggington’s secretary
was at times off-pitch in a very
penetrating role.
There is little left to say. This
beautifully meditative journey
throughoneofthemostextraordinary
of humanity’s episodes needs to be
seen by everyone.
What: Woyzeck
Where: Omnibus Clapham, SW4
When: 19th Nov to 7th Dec 2013
Price: £15, concessions £12
T
hrough an ominous mist and
a haunting cello note, I enter
the theatre. Two figures sit
there, hacking away at timber,
as I cross the woodchip floor
to my seat. This is just how Georg
Büchner’s seminal work Woyzeck
should be performed: intimate,
inclusive, atmospheric. Clapham’s
newly opened Omnibus Theatre
provides an excellent setting for this
play. In its first in-house production,
the converted Victorian library creates
a truly unique performance space, cut
in two by a colonnade that encourages
exciting and innovative stage design.
One hundred years after its first
performance, Woyzeck tells the story
of a poor man – a barber, soldier and
occasional scientific test subject, who
is constantly belittled and ridiculed
by his superiors. When his wife finally
cheats on him with a handsome Drum
Major, his eroding mental condition
compels him to murder her in a fit
of rage. The plot was in fact inspired
by an actual murder that took place
in Leipzig, executed by a wigmaker
called Woyzeck who said he heard
voices that urged him to do it.
Throughout the play, Woyzeck is
dehumanised and criticised, whether
it be for pissing on a wall like an animal
or by being forced to eat nothing
but peas for six months as part of an
experiment. Even the midday sun
oppresses him as he works to scrape
together a living for his wife and child.
His whole life is torment, submission,
misery, like the monkey puppet forced
to perform by the dominant showman.
And so it seems simple enough a
play, a classic tale of poverty, lust and
a murder of passion. However, it is
anything but that, as it becomes clear
through the phenomenal scriptwriting
of Büchner. Free will, determinism and
exploitation of the underclasses are all
addressed through the tragedy that
Woyzeck becomes. It is the powerfully
relevant nature of such themes that
makes this play so timeless and
especially poignant in today’s world of
economic injustice.
Because of this, people often
describe Woyzeck as the first truly
modern drama. Modernity is also seen
in its assembly. Fragmented, it is a play
formed from a mosaic of cut scenes
that creates a plotline as disjointed as
Woyzeck’s paranoid mind.
For me, it is the play’s writing,
themes and structure that make it so
brilliant, not especially its setting in a
small German town. I feel this detracts
from the work’s underlying messages
and so I think an update is needed to
make it more relevant to the audience.
Hence, I thought it a shame that the
original setting was hardly changed by
the director. I went away thinking what
an exceptionally clever play Büchner
had written, as opposed to considering
its interpretation and performance.
Such was the influence of Büchner’s
play that many adaptations of it were
made, most notably Alban Berg’s opera
Wozzeck, which appeared at the Royal
Opera House a few weeks ago. I found
comparing the two very interesting,
as it showed precisely the effect of
music on the drama itself. Berg’s
modernist masterpiece of atonality,
I feel, perfectly complimented and
even accentuated the madness and
hopelessness of the main protagonist’s
struggles. But which was better, the
play or the opera? Even though the
former was excellent, both intense
and poignant, I feel the opera was
able to intensify this experience,
sensationalising the script to create a
piece of art that still lingers with me
after all this time.
Woyzeckisstillwellworthseeing.The
beautiful setting and some excellent
acting performances, especially from
Liam Smith, the helpless yet frenzied
Woyzeck, really make for a brilliant
show. But I think what is most clear
from the play is the sheer genius of
Büchner. At only 23, he was able to
create a work that combines drama
and emotion with deep philosophical
questioning and poignant social
criticism. To create a character in
Woyzeck that can be empathised
with, despite having murdered his
wife in a state of virtual insanity, is
a phenomenal feat definitely worth
experiencing.
