IC produce strong
showing in Ultimate Frisbee
Philip Sandwell
IC Ultimate Frisbee
The season started with a bang for
Imperial College Ultimate, sending
three teams to Open Indoor Region-
als. Held in Dagenham, East London,
this competition saw 36 of the best
teams in the South East compete for
a top-six finish, and with it, a place at
the National finals.
University-level Ultimate is played
on two surfaces: outdoors, on large
grass pitches, and indoors, played on
hardwood basketball courts. It is also
played across three divisions: open
(where anyone is eligible to play),
women’s (exclusively for females)
and mixed (with an even gender split
across the team). With Open Indoor
Regionals hosting such a depth of
teams, qualification for Nationals was
never going to be easy.
Starting on Saturday seeded fifth,
Imperial College Ultimate needed to
come out hard to fight their way up the
rankings. The first group-stage match
was drawn against Portsmouth II, and
it soon became apparent that these
were to be the group whipping-boys.
A relatively nonchalant performance
saw Imperial gain easy turnovers,
force simple errors and eventually
reach the maximum points cap in
less than twenty minutes, winning the
game 13-0.
The next game pitted Imperial
against King’s College; the teams not
only share the training ground in
Hyde Park, but also a friendly local
rivalry. Imperial stepped up their
game against this stronger opposition
and, even during several long points,
played impressive shut-down defence
to deny several scoring opportunities.
Meanwhile on offense, Imperial
played it cool, taking the chances they
were given to extend a comfortable
lead, eventually winning 9-2 and
setting up a pivotal final group game.
The University of Sussex are the
dominant force in the South East,
winning several National titles
across all divisions in recent years.
Testament to their strength was their
second team, featuring cameos from
several of their first-team players,
who were also unbeaten thus far in
the competition. The group-deciding
game saw Imperial trailing 3-1 after
giving up some cheap long goals, but
overcoming their nerves and finding
their feet the London team battled
back and overturned the deficit to level
the scoreline. With the momentum
behind them, Imperial forced errors
from the Sussex side who now could
not handle Imperial’s offense. With
time running out and with the disc in
their hands, Imperial soaked up the
pressure to win the game, and with it
the pool.
By beating their second team,
Imperial earned a semi-final matchup
against Sussex I to start their Sunday.
Facing a team unbeaten in the region
for several years was an intimidating
prospect, but Imperial began the
match on an equal footing, trading
scores. Both teams forced throwaways
and both teams got blocks, and with
the game staying tight play became
more and more intense. The toughest
match of the tournament for both
teams, late in the game Sussex forced
an error from the Imperial side and,
already in the lead, scored the goal to
extend their lead to two points. Out
of time and out of luck, Imperial had
their first competitive defeat of the
season.
Upset at the loss but still proud
of the performance, there was still
everything to play for: Imperial could
still end the weekend ranked second.
Pitted against the other beaten semi-
finalist, Portsmouth I, Imperial’s
defensive strength was crucial –
locking down the opposition, the
London side played the disc through
the team to score a number of crisp
goals. Portsmouth, who looked strong
early in the match, began to capitulate
and failed to threaten the endzone,
with Imperial seeing out the game in
relative ease.
Winning meant Imperial faced up
against Surrey, the beaten finalist.
Over recent years the two teams have
met at crucial points in tournaments
and a strong rivalry has emerged,
which incentivised an Imperial victory
even more. An athletic side, Surrey
looked promising in the early stages
of the match, but the experienced
Imperial team was up to the challenge
and denied a number of Surrey’s
attempted scoring passes. On offense,
Imperial kept calm despite significant
pressure at the end of a hard weekend,
working the disc well and being
rewarded with some confident scores.
Despite the closeness of play, the
scoreline painted a very different
picture: a 7-4 victory for Imperial.
Beaten only by the eventual
winners, Imperial secured second
place – their highest ever finish at a
Regional competition – and a spot at
the prestigious Division 1 Nationals
with fifteen of the top-ranked
university teams from around the
UK. The second team also finished
very strongly, finishing 13th and
higher than five university first teams,
which bodes very well for many of the
team who were playing in their first
competitive tournament.
Meanwhile the third team finished
25th, earning silverware for topping
their bracket of the tournament and
capping a very successful weekend for
Imperial College Ultimate.
Ultimate is still welcoming new
players – if you are interested in
playing, regardless of experience,
come along to our training sessions
in Hyde Park on Wednesdays (13.00-
15.00) and Saturdays (12.00-14.00)
or email ultimate@imperial.ac.uk for

Immortals
royally Rumble
Regents
The Imperial Immortals returned to
Harlington to take on their old rivals,
the KCL Regents, in their third
match of the season. However, there
was more on the line than league
positions, as the teams were playing
for the London Bowl. Coming off the
back of wins against Greenwich and
Westminster, the Immortals were
looking to continue their winning
ways.
It was a cold Sunday Afternoon
when the match kicked off. The
Immortals’ special teams unit was
once again fired up, looking to
maintain the good work they put
in against the Greenwich Mariners,
and sprinted down field to tackle the
Regents returner.
The home defence then took the
field. So far this season no team had
scored against the Immortals and
they were looking to hold onto this
record. The Regents’ offence could
not break through the big hitting
defence and were forced to punt the
ball on their fourth down.
The offence then took the field,
big runs from Emanuel Olagbaju
and Duncan Mackinnon pushed
the Regents’ defence back. The
Immortals pass game, which had
previously struggled this season,
began to come together with Toby
Sinclair finding Henry Badham with
a deep ball. However, the defence
was not giving in easily, and stopped
the Immortals getting into the end
zone.
The game continued in a similar
fashion, but big plays came in the
second quarter. Alex Hutchinson
leapt to intercept a deep pass from
the Regents’ quarterback, but the
offence failed to score from the
advantageous field position. The
home defence then put in another
big effort and the Immortals’ offence
were ready to take the field again. A
hard-hitting run game pushed the
Immortals deep into the Regents’
half. A quick pass threaded from
Toby to Tino Millar, who had beaten
his defender for pace, provided the
first touchdown. After a failed PAT
attempt, the score stood at 6-0.
Thescorestoodgoingintohalftime,
but the Immortals were ahead they
knew that the small mistakes they
were making on both sides of the
ball could lead to them losing their
current unbeaten record. The half
began with the Regents kicking the
ball deep to Tino, who raced behind
the wedge and managed to make it
to the 40-yard line.
The highlights of the third quarter
were Duncan’s hard running and
spin moves and Tino grabbing a deep
pass from Toby. It was not long until
the Immortals scored again. The
offensive line created a big pocket for
Toby who had time to pick a pass to
Henry, who ran in for a touchdown.
The PAT attempt was converted by
Duncan diving across the goal line
increasing the score to 14-0.
The third quarter came to a
close, and after a long break due
to injury, the Immortals defence
took the field to stop a Regents
drive. The away offence took the
field looking determined to score.
They continued to punch the ball
towards the Immortals’ goal line and
eventually ran in for a touchdown,
becoming the first team to score on
the Immortals this season.
With the score at 14-6 and less
than a quarter to go, the Immortals
knew that they had to keep the ball
and run down the clock. After a
big drive down the field, with both
pass and run plays picking apart
the Regents’ defence, the away team
were forced to take a timeout with
ninety seconds remaining.
The Immortals’ offensive coaches
discussed the situation and decided
it was time to use the reverse play.
The fake was made to the halfback,
and then Tino took the handoff
from Toby. The defence took the
bait and Tino had an easy run in for
his second touchdown of the day.
Emmanuel then scored the PAT
attempt, diving through a large gap
created by the offensive line.
With that the game was over,
the final score being 22-6. The
Immortals had retained the London
Bowl and continued their impressive
winning streak, which now stands
at three games, placing them top of
their conference. Man of the match
awards when to Alex Hutchinson,
Dexter Valencia, Emanuel Olagbaju
and Anuj Baid. The overall MVP
award went to Tino Millar for his
hard work on both offence and
special teams.
The Immortals next face the Royal
Holloway Bears at Harlington on
December 1st. Kick off is at 12 and
all are welcome to come and support.
Harry Badham reports as IC
win London Bowl and preserve
unbeaten record
Aussies strike
significant
psychological
blow
Kunal Wagle
Sports Editor
In last week’s column I said that, de-
spite the 3-0 scoreline, Australia trou-
bled England in the summer, and that
England would need to be wary if they
wanted to retain the Ashes for the
fourth consecutive time (for the first
time ever). In the Brisbane test the
Australian team produced a perfor-
mance beyond their wildest dreams
(and those of most of their supporters)
to take a 1-0 lead in the series and win
their first game since January.
There are some worrying points
for England, beyond going behind in
the series itself. The first is the na-
ture of the loss. The Australians look
up to the task and fired up – Michael
Clarke’s comments that James An-
derson should “get ready for a fuck-
ing broken arm” prove this. This vic-
tory would only have given them more
confidence, especially the large mar-
gin of victory.
Last week in Felix I wrote that Eng-
land’s batting looked in good shape
during the warm up games, with
Alistair Cook and Michael Carberry
looking particularly strong. However
the top order’s strong performance
may have had its disadvantages as the
middle order looked under-cooked,
with Kevin Pietersen’s second innings
dismissal summing up England’s per-
formance. The two-day practice game
before the Adelaide test is now crucial
for them to get some practice in the
middle.
One positive for England is that
the bowlers produced a reasonable
performance in the first innings, dis-
missing Australia for what looked like
a meagre total (293). They may want
to reconsider selecting Chris Tremlett
ahead of Steven Finn. They might also
want to further bolster their attack by
adding all rounder Ben Stokes in place
of Jonathan Trott, who has returned
home with a stress-related illness.
Perhaps the most worrying factor is
not only that Michael Clarke returned
to form with a hundred, but that Da-
vid Warner and Brad Haddin also
supported ably – something that was
absent in the summer.
Adelaide is a must win game for
England now, as they can’t go to Perth
– a bouncy pitch where Australia will
probably be favourites – 2-0 down. In
terms of ability, England should still
win this. But Australia have struck a
significant psychological blow – one
that may prove decisive.

Predictions
James White
Football Columnist
Tottenham v Man United
(Sunday 12pm, Sky Sports 1)
Andre-Villas Boas needs to go back to
the drawing board after humiliation at
the Etihad last weekend. Spurs have
held a very defensive line all season,
even though AVB has the attacking
resources to play much more offen-
sively. He needs to take some risks but
is unlikely to change his tactics when
the champions come a-calling. It’s
great to see Wayne Rooney firing on
all cylinders again, and United were
unlucky to only draw at Cardiff. This is
a great opportunity for David Moyes
to silence more doubters and build on
the Red Devils’ strong record at White
Hart Lane.
Prediction: 0-2
Hull v Liverpool
(Sunday 2:05pm, Sky Sports 1)
Steve Bruce will have been extremely
disappointed that Hull lost their un-
beaten home record to rock bottom
Crystal Palace last weekend, and
with an extra man. For the first time
this season, they looked vulnerable
and disorganised. Their centre halves
could be chasing shadows on Sunday
as Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez
are capable of running rings around
them. The Reds came as close as any
team has to ending Everton’s un-
beaten home record for 2013 in last
weekend’s thrilling Merseyside derby.
Hull don’t score many so the Reds will
rightly be strong favourites.
Prediction: 0-2
Chelsea v Southampton
(Sunday 4:10pm, Sky Sports 1)
Both sides will be bang up for this.
Chelsea’s big win at West Ham was
only their second win away from
Stamford Bridge all season and José
Mourinho says he now wants his side
to embark on a winning run in the
busy run-up to Christmas. They have
a kind set of fixtures to come and, with
all their players fit, they could soon
seize pole position. But the Saints are
no pushovers and Mauricio Pochet-
tino will have been disappointed that
they laid down with a whimper af-
ter an Artur Boruc howler gifted the
Gunners a lead last weekend. Expect
an impassioned contest but the Blues’
class should prevail.
Prediction: 3-1
Newcastle v West Brom
(Saturday 5:30pm, Sky Sports 1)
Both these teams are entertaining
to watch because their attackers link
up well and understand each other’s
games. Steve Clarke likes to go for it
away too – this could be a Desmond.
Prediction: 2-2
Best of the rest
(Saturday 3pm unless stated)
Aston Villa v Sunderland
Villa showed a lot of determination to
come from 2-0 down to draw at West
Brom on Monday. Gus Poyet’s Black
Cats were luckless at Stoke and do not
travel well so anything here will be a
bonus.
Prediction: 2-1
Cardiff v Arsenal
The Bluebirds are fast making a habit
of seeing off the league’s big guns on
their home patch. But Arsenal have
been an entirely different kettle of fish
this season and should extend their
lead at the summit here.
Prediction: 1-2
Norwich v Crystal Palace
Tony Pulis will recognise Palace’s win

IC Judo produce
stunning performance
in London Open
Andres Olivares gives his account
Judo players from around the UK
descended on the University of East
London to compete in a tournament
of titanic proportions. The main Im-
perial College contingent left from
South Kensington at 6.30am so as to
make it in time for weigh-ins, a tedi-
ous but necessary part of any Judo
tournament. First up to compete were
the women, and they did not disap-
point. Suzie Lednarova won gold in
the under 70kg black belt division,
buzz-sawing through all competition
with none of her matches going the
full 5 minutes on her way. Renata Pic-
ciotto pulled off a stunner, winning
the novice to green belt under 52kg
division which included women with
much more than her month or so of
Judo experience, as well as competing
in the weight class above. Ex-captain
and former Imperial student Alice
Mitchell managed to get a bronze in
the womens under 57kg. We were
then treated to a groundwork clinic by
our young Brazilian jiu-jitsu phenom-
enon Nour Kelfi, who won the bronze
in his division. The next category to
compete were the under 60 kg men’s
black belts, famed for their speed, car-
dio and unrelenting pace. They did not
disappoint, with our very own cap-
tain, Andres Olivares del Campo who,
leading by example, ran through the
opposition, as if they were like many
uneaten bowls of tapas, scoring sever-
al devastating Ippons (Judo’s equiva-
lent of the knockout, which is scored
by throwing an opponent flat on his
back) and my personal favourite for
its unexpectedness – a twisting arm
lock out of thin air when his opponent
was stalling on his back, which had his
opponent tapping in seconds. Straight
after this were the under 66 kg black
belts, a large, talent-filled division that
had no fewer than 3 Imperial Judokas.
This division was equally exciting to
behold, and Etienne Wilbaux snapped
up a well-deserved Bronze medal. The
highlight was the tense and well con-
tested final won by João Pela. Neither
of the competitors could make any
headway and the contest seemed sure
to head into extra time when João un-
leashed his secret weapon, an unor-
thodox switch to a southpaw stance
followed by a spectacular throw, which
catapulted his opponent gracefully
into the air before landing him rather
less gracefully on his back for the Ip-
pon and a well deserved first tourna-
ment win. Next on the mat was Juuso
Terava aka ‘The Iceman’ or ‘The Finn-
isher’, for both his ice cool demeanour
under pressure and his scintillating
Judo, which often leaves competitors
quivering in fear. He showed clinical
Judo to earn himself a bronze in the
under 90kg black belt division. The
final two medal winners were in the
heavy weight division – Chris Holds-
worth-Swan, the Judo club’s social sec
and newly minted brown-belt (with an
uncanny resemblance to Hagrid from
Harry Potter), secured the silver med-
al in his first soirée into black belt level
competition, with Chong Swee Hang
securing the bronze.
In the team competition Imperial
College came second to Nottingham
University, only narrowly missing out
on the trophy by two points. There
was a great team spirit on show from
everyone, with people watching and
cheering on our competitors, and the
more experienced Judokas were able
to provide tips and corner advice,
which really made the difference to
everyone. Special thanks must go to
Glenn Spiers, our coach who gave up
his Sunday, despite being ill, to coach
and support the team. His mat-side
coaching and encouragement was
crucial to the success of all of our
competing athletes.
IC JUDO
at Hull was smash-and-grab and it will
take time for him to impose his own
style, but he inherits a spirited side ca-
pable of pushing a struggling Canaries
outfit right to the wire.
Prediction: 1-1
West Ham v Fulham
Neither of these sides can buy a goal
right now and both Sam Allardyce and
Martin Jol will both fear for their fu-
tures. This could turn out to be a rel-
egation six pointer but who is going to
find the net?
Prediction: 0-0
Man City v Swansea
Swansea badly needed their win at
Fulham last weekend to restore con-
fidence in the camp. Unfortunately
for them, Man City are indomitable
at home. Their strikeforce is just irre-
sistible and they could rack up a few
cricket scores at the Etihad this year
Prediction: 3-0
Everton v Stoke
Mark Hughes was a relieved man af-
ter the Potters finally won versus Sun-
derland but they are not suited to the
passing style he is trying to impose.
They will be tough to break down but
the Toffees have the flair players to
win the midfield battle at Goodison
Park.
Prediction: 2-0
