Union launches
awareness blitz
ROBIN RILEY
Student officers of Imperial College
Union have set in motion a "major"
campaign to address the loss of the
on-campus bookstore tender.
ICU Council, the Union's chief
policy-making body, held a two-hour
meeting on Tuesday concerned
almost exclusively with the fallout
from the College's decision to award
the tender to booksellers
Waterstone's. The decision means
that the Union will no longer be able
to sell academic texts from its current
Sherfield walkway site, and may
have serious repercussions for the
way the Union operates and the
scope of its activities.
During the meeting, student repre-
sentatives from clubs, societies,
Constituent Colleges and academic
departments discussed the problems
facing the Union in the light of the
loss of its largest trading outlet. They
identified the principle challenge to
be raising the Union's profile among
IC's student population, and
expressed fears that many students
may be wholly or partially ignorant
of the three key tenets of ICU's oper-
ation. Firstly, the wide range of free
services, opportunities and activities
that the Union provides; Secondly,
the fact that campus facilities such as
the bars, disco, bookstore and cater-
ing in Beit Quad are managed by the
Union, and thirdly that the trading
surplus from these outlets is used to ,
fund the Union's other services and
activities. By raising student aware-
ness of these facts, the Union aims to
increase its trading activity and,
more importantly, mobilise a body of
opinion in order to protect its exist-
ing outlets against further attack.
A variety of measures were sug-
gested by members of the Council to
tackle the problem, principally
including a "petition of concern,"
consisting a standard letter to be
signed by students and presented to
the Rector. Further actions may
include the re-naming of all clubs
and societies, to include the word
'Union'; IC boat club, for example,
becoming ICU boat club. In addition,
the Union may seek to 'brand'
goods, services and events in order to
remind students that profits from
these outlets are reinvested in the
College community. A campaign of
posters and flyers around the cam-
pus, and of letters to College gover-
nors is already being brought into
effect.
Council members fell short of con-
vening a 'protest committee' or sim-
ilar body, instead entrusting imple-
mentation of the new measures to
ICU's Executive committee, normal-
ly responsible for the Union's day-
to-day running.
Student officials present at the
meeting conceded that there would
be little to be gained from any cam-
paign targeted directly at Water-
stone's or the new store itself.
Speaking to Felix, Piers Williams,
ICU Deputy President for Finance
and Services, admitted; "I don't
think we're under any illusions as to
the reversibility of the College's
decision."
Although traditional means of stu-
dent protest, such as a strike or boy-
cott of the new store, are unlikely to
be supported by Union officials, the
staging of events to attract national
media attention has not been ruled
out.

IC Reporter loses memory
College security procedures face
renewed criticism this week follow-
ing the theft on Monday night of
£14,000 of computing equipment
from Imperial College's Press and
Publications Office. The PPO is
responsible for the production of IC
Reporter, the College's staff news-
sheet.
Workers in the PPO have
expressed fears that they may have
been "blacklisted" by thieves as this
is the third time in six months that
they have been burgled, this latest
incident putting the total loss at over
£37,000. The thefts may lie behind
delays in the release of the latest
issue of the Reporter.
Some sources claim this burglary
comes suspiciously soon after the
circulation of new pages of the inter-
nal telephone directory last week.
The same intruders may be responsi-
ble for all three break-ins and
Security are investigating this along-
side other possibilities.
Burglars forced the door of the 5th
floor office, very near to the Rector's
Suite, and removed three computers.
Linda Davies, Head of Press,
Publications and Public Relations at
IC, expressed her annoyance over the
theft. "It's not only a waste of
resources. It is extremely frustrating
to be so disrupted, especially at this
time of the year when we are really
stretched" she said. PPO workers
were temporarily barred from the
office until police officers had taken
fingerprints. However, when staff
were forced to return on Wednesday
due to work pressures, the Police had
not yet arrived.
This incident has intensified calls
for individual departments within the
Sherfield Building to be protected by
their own swipe card entry systems.
The Rector's Suite already benefits
from such a system.
Addressing the effectiveness of
current security measures, Director
of Estates Ian Caldwell admitted
"...obviously Sherfield is not as
secure as we might like... We are
looking at options, methods of pre-
caution, sensor detectors and securi-
ty camera networks."
Mr Caldwell explained the diffi-
culties of incorporating an open,
working environment into a secure
building and confessed; "odd bits of
pilfering go on all the time"
