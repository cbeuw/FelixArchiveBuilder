12 C O L U M N S FELIX FRIDAY 1 7TH JANUARY
Like shooting fish in a barrel. Such
was my reaction to reading Friday's
Felix and planning this week's col-
umn. I almost feel guilty about how
easy this is to write. When you have
quotes like 'College hasn't shot itself
in the foot; just maybe shot the
Union', one feels tempted to ignore
the bookstore issue and pick some-
thing more challenging. My job is
not to do the Union's bidding, nor
anyone else for that matter, but I
have to say that the bookstore tender-
ing process leaves a soup • on to be
desired. My concern is that we get a
good bookstore and the College, and
thus the taxpayer, gets a good deal. I
must say that either Waterstone's or
the Union would satisfy the former.
The good deal question is not so clear
cut.
Professor Alan Swanson, a key
figure in the proceedings is on the
record as saying 'another group of
people might have made a different
decision.' This does not fill me with
confidence. A word to the wise,
Alan: don't let the National Audit
Office catch you using phrases like
that, it makes them very twitchy. It
implies a myriad of undesirable prac-
tices, most of which I shall refrain
from mentioning since I rather fancy
finishing my PhD. I'll play Devil's
advocate and suggest that an auditor
with a keen fiscal nose would say
that this implies incompetence, a fail-
ure to select the bid that was indis-
putably in the best interests of the
College/taxpayer. If a local council
did this, councillors could find them-
selves surcharged, as has happened
on several occasions. It has also been
been stated by Prof Swanson that the
College will make up the Union's
loss. The lost profit is put at £70,000.
The rent for the new bookstore is
£60,000. In addition, IC will take 3%
of gross sales. The current bookstore
has a turnover of
£1 million.
Allowing for
some expansion in
book sales and
deduction of sta-
tionery and other
lines not provided
by Waterstone's, I
would imagine the
figure to be £0.9 to
£1 million. Total
take by College
equals £85,000.
Strip out the
£70,000 pledged to
the Union and you
have £15,000
per year A VOlCC OI
profit for the
College, you cry. Makes a pleasant
change, you say. But let's not forget
that you still have the Union book-
store, albeit not selling academic
books, occupying a prime site on the
walkway. Had ICU won, the College
would have received £60,000 rent
and presumably the cut of the sales.
They would also have freed up a sec-
ond retail site, ideal for the proposed
transformation of the walkway.
B a k e r
The College may well say that it
doubted the Union's ability to cover
the rent, but this ignores the broader
remit that they have over
Waterstone's. WH Smith, under their
new chief executive Bill Cockburn,
are anxious to boost margins and
refocus a vast undisciplined product
range group-wide. This is wholly
laudable- you
wouldn't expect
me to come out
against the notion
of shareholder
value. This all
means that you
won't be buying
your biros and
Magnapads in the
new bookstore.
The Union, how-
ever, could sell
anything inciden-
tal to academic
texts, and the
expanded premis-
es and a little
more of the
management
acumen that turned the existing out-
let from a Sherfield-run loss-maker,
for which you will never be forgiven,
into a nice little earner, would easily
enable this. Existing lines could be
expanded and floorspace could be
given to new products. Don't get me
wrong, Waterstone's will offer a
first-rate bookstore, like their other
branches; the "powerful" IT invest-
ment is a bit of a mystery, though.
R e a s o n
Don't think that I've been got at by
the Union. ICU does a good job, but
is far from perfect. Yes, the Ents
lounge refurbishment was a great
success, but the money spent on
DaVinci's was farcical. In its
strivance to be democratic, it has
more committees than the E U ,
which opens it up to the influence of
people who like the sound of their
own voice more than is helpful. Give
the Sab's more power I say. On the
positive side, it makes a lot of money
for us through its trading activities,
has a huge number of supported
clubs and societies (too many some
would say) and about the only week-
ly student newspaper in the country.
Trying to 'shoot' it just as IC is about
to expand seems very short-sighted,
and a move that looks set to be a net
cost to the College, precisely the
opposite of what they were trying to
achieve. They'll get it right one day,
won't they?
This has all taken up more space than
intended, so no time to mention the
grant cheques fiasco, of which I was
a victim, other than to question Tony
Cullen's comment 'not least the stu-
dents' being affected. Who else, for
God's sake? I promise I shall get all
political on you next week after far
too long a gap. Oh, and for the final
time, it is NOT compulsory to sleep
with boys or wear stockings to be a
Conservative MP. The subject is
closed.
Personally Speaking
Happiness is not a human condition.
This is the big mistake people make.
Television and other media try hard
to convince us of the contrary, but I
doubt there is one person reading
this article that considers themself
truly happy with their lot. Whether it
be discontentnient with the course,
trouble with relationships, crises of
confidence in the way you look,
dress or act, personal tragedy, ill-
ness, financial worries or whatever
people find to disquiet themselves,
happiness is at best a transitory expe-
rience, at worst a concept as alien as
cheese and marmalade sandwiches.
One thing we tend to exchange for
happiness is hope or optimism, fail-
ing that, psychological drugs of a
more tangible form. But when that is
gone, what is left? Do you hope for
hope? It seems that the pessimists of
the world have got it right; that's
probably why they call themselves
realists.
My theory on the Universe has
been reinforced over the last few
weeks. It states
that the
Cartesian God
is not one that can be viewed as good
or bad, only indifferent. I believe that
the way that physical reality fits
together, interrelates, and indeed
exists, can be seen as proof of some
kind of creative and infinitely pow-
erful force. The laws of the interac-
tions between space/time and
mass/energy are what creates and
sustains the Universe; it is the creator
of these laws to whom we should
refer to as a God.
And there seems very strongly
indeed that there is no part of these
laws which relate to the human sens-
es of justice, morality or happiness,
and thus no innate justice, morality
or happiness exists in the way the
Universe works, only indifference.
But, because it is the human wont
to expect, demand and strive for hap-
piness, justice and goodness, we are
necessarily going to be disappointed,
as there is all too yawning a chasm
between our desires and this grim
reality.
