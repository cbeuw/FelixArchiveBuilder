Christmas excesses fail to halt IC Hockey
After an excess of pork-pies over the
Christmas vacation, the slightly more
rotund Mens 1st XI rumbled back
into form with a 4-1 demolition of
UCH in the London League. Despite
the adverse foggy, and an extra 2.4
inches around the waist-band, IC
started brightly and never looked
back. An early goal mouth scramble
resulted in Sid the Sexist netting for a
1-0 lead. However, a momentary slip
in our rock-like defence allowed
UCH to equalise from a short corner.
Further IC pressure produced another
goal mouth epic, with Plasticman this
time benefitting from UCH's defen-
sive ineptitude. This lead was not fur-
ther increased before the half-time
break.
The second period began in much
the same way as the first had ended,
with constant IC pressure. UCH were
unable to withstand our overwhelm-
ing attacking talent, and eventually
folded. This allowed Indiana Jones,
our minger-cum-ginger, to score his
first goal for the College, courtesy of
some sloppy defending and several
deflections off his chest and chin.
There was no stopping the IC
steam-train now. Chicken Bol was
determined that our supremacy
should continue. So he swapped his
stick for an axe and produced the
worst tackle seen anywhere - far
more suited to a Vinny Jones compi-
lation video. Had it not been so
Foggy, Basil (the bird behind the
whistle) would surely have sent him
for an early bath, but leniency was
the result, and only a green card was
produced. Undaunted, IC ravaged on,
and despite several wasted chances,
Rent Boy fired in for a fourth goal
from a short corner.
The performance as a whole was
impressive, with Porn-O always run-
ning around like a headless chicken,
and the back four doing a sterling job.
Mention must be made of Golden
Boy for occasionally roaring into the
opposition circle, a phenomenon usu-
ally seen only when retrieving stray
balls during the warm-up.
Thanks to Basil for coming along
to peer through the gloom, and 2.4
inches for deciding to watch a group
of sheep molesters ahead of repre-
senting his College. Hopefully, he
can fit us into his social calendar for
future away fixtures.
Medals all round for IC fencing squad
Most of the ICFC fencing team trav-
elled up to Nottingham last weekend
looking for results in the individual
championships. Last year IC fencers
won a gold and a bronze and made
two other finals. The first weapon
was epee, in which we had Eddie
Rysdale, Reuben Kalam, and Phil
Miller competing. Eddie amazed
everyone - including himself - beat-
ing two national level epeeists on his
way to the final, which he lost 15-14.
Saturday saw a strong men's team
for IC, and again Eddie made the
final, this time winning the gold
medal with a 15-14 victory. Henry
Morton was also a finalist. On the
Sunday, IC was defending the men's
sabre title, but this year could only
manage one final place, thanks to Mo
Mansoori, who ended up seventh. So
overall we came out better than last
year, with one gold, one silver and
two other finalists.
