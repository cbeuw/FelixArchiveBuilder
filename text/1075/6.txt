6 N E W S FELIX FRIDAY 17TH IANUARY
Gun$ or Brfad?
Kelly Robinson looks into a recent Government
policy on the vetting of Overseas students at UK
universities.
A former Imperial College student is
currently serving the first month of
her twenty year sentence for her part
in the Israeli Embassy bombing.
Samar Alami graduated with a
degree in Chemical Engineering and
proceeded to use the knowledge she
acquired during her studies to wreak
havoc in central London during
November 1994.
This incident prompted Parliament
to take swift action. The Foreign and
Commonwealth Office implemented
a voluntary agreement with universi-
ties to consider carefully applications
for PhD and research placements
from some overseas students.
In a letter to the Chairman of the
Committee of Vice-Chancellors and
Principals, M r Tim Boswell, MP,
states that "...the Government attach-
es great importance to preventing the
transfer of technology related to the
development of mass destruction."
Institutions are now asked to vol-
unteer details of the candidates'
employment and academic back-
ground to the Government, along
with information about their pro-
posed course and its length.
Universities are then advised of the
risks involved in admitting a particu-
lar student, though the final decision
is left to their discretion.
Only students from certain coun-
tries designated by our Government
are subject to such vetting. The
Government have stressed that the
list is "subject to amendment in the
light of changed circumstances."
The success of this policy is still
doubtful as only 7 8 students have
been reported by universities since
1994
As of this month, universities will
have no choice as to whether to sub-
mit the details of such students to the
Foreign Office. The morality of such
a policy has been called into question
by many, and the whole issue is a
potential ethical minefield. This
dilemma has particular resonance at
IC, where over 30% of students come
from overseas.
The majority of the students ques-
tioned, those from Britain and the
"Most research at IC is
considered., to be
potentially dangerous
knowledge."
countries listed, see the vetting of stu-
dents as both a violation of human
rights and unfair. They feel that all
people are equally capable of using
knowledge to the greater good or
indeed to the detriment of society.
This being the case, it is not the
Governments
place to decide
who is and who
is not a caring
enough person
to study in this
country.
S t u d e n t s
from the coun-
tries involved feel they have been
singled out and as left bewildered as
to why their homelands and people
considered irresponsible. This is
especially so because of the elusive
nature of the criteria used to compile
the list of dangerous countries means
that it is impossible to tell exactly
why each individual country was pin-
pointed.
There are also those students who
deem the process to be a necessary
evil, which, if implemented correctly,
could prevent the needless death of
innocent civilians in the future.
Amongst these students it is general-
ly considered that, although the sys-
tem may be unjust, it is preferable for
one foreign student to suffer than to
run the risk of letting he/she cause the
death of others.
More again felt
that the only fair
way to set about
monitoring stu-
dents would be to
ensure all students
were included,
thus increasing the
likelihood of nip-
ping any dark aspi-
rations in the bud.
A small minority supported the
policy whole-heartedly, stressing that
those with nothing to hide should
have no cause to object to it being
implemented or to themselves being
vetted.
Some members of the IC staff feel
that the whole system is seriously

flawed. Dr Hassard, the Post
Graduate Admissions Tutor in the
Physics Department expressed con-
cern over the Government's list of
"risk" countries "...it requires amend-
ment. Many of those on the list are
signatories of the Nuclear Non-pro-
1 i f e r a t i o n
Treaty. Dr
H a s s a r d
believes a cer-
tain amount of
racism is
involved, with
Britain making
judgements as
to which countries are suitable to
own nuclear weapons. He believes
that Parliament needs to address the
broader issues, with curbing the
spread of nuclear materials taking
priority.
Sir Ronald Oxburgh, the Rector,
has said that the policy serves the
purpose of reassuring those universi-
ties which feel ill at ease with the
whole subject. It is his belief that it is
part of a much larger initiative by
both the British and other govern-
ments.
The general consensus of opinion
amongst those officials available to
comment at the embassies involved
is that the system is inherently
wrong. The Israeli Embassy see it as
an infringement of the human rights
of the individuals
involved. It felt that
the Government
were unjust in their
implementation of
such a policy.
There are however,
no plans in
progress to see this
ruling repealed.
The situation
raises a barrage of controversial
issues and there are many questions
which appear to be left unaddressed.
Britain, for example, saw fit to sell a
vast quantity of missiles and various
other military dangerous articles to
Iraq when the Government were
aware that the Gulf war was immi-
nent. Effectively, British soldiers
were killed by weapons sold to their
enemy by their own country! How
can such a country deem some coun-
tries worthy of nuclear weapons and
others unworthy?
Why is it that Middle Eastern
countries are allowed to buy weapons
of mass destruction from Britain, but
cannot be trusted to make their own
using British know-how? Why is
Pakistan black-listed, for example, as
a country held firmly in the pocket of
the United States, do they pose a seri-
ous threat to British, or indeed
World, peace? The present political
unrest in Pakistan may amount to a
civil war - is this the reason why
future Pakistani students are subject
to Government vetting? If the answer
is yes, why is it that students from
other countries experiencing civil
disturbances - for example Nigeria -
are not also vetted?
Also, can it be fair to deny anyone
education on the grounds of their eth-
nic background; is Britain in a posi-
tion to make such judgements?
In addition to this the effectiveness
of such a procedure must be called
into question. Is it possible to judge
the terrorist tendancies of potential
students given only such surface
details as academic and employment
records, especially considering that a
person applying for a post in a British
University is highly unlikely to have
a criminal record or to have been
involved in any documented
"affray".
The Government's fears regarding
the proliferation of nuclear weapons
are not unfounded, however. In 1979
an Iraqi Post-Doctoral student, who
had carried out research in ICs High
Energy Physics group, returned to
Iraq and established it's nuclear
weapons programme. This is not the
end of the story however; IC can still
be linked to this nuclear programme
which does provide a risk to the rest
of the world; the current leader of this
programme is also an ex-IC student!
In the light of such evidence, the
last question posed by the vetting of
certain students must be: Do we have
a choice?
