How to play
•You have 35 points to spend on 8 'players' from the five divisions listed
opposite; 2 players for each of the 4 sabbatical positions.
•You DO NOT have to spend all 35 points, but you MUST field 8 players.
•You cannot use any player more than once, with the exception of 'None of
the above' and 'New election.' These two may not be used twice (i.e. as both
first and second) for the same sabbatical position.
•When you have chosen your team, enter your choices in BLOCK CAPITALS
in the correct boxes on the form provided. Add up the total value of your team
(not to exceed 35) and enter this in the correct box.
•Fill in your Felix Fantasy Sabbatical League team name, and the rest of your
details and hand your form in to the Felix office (Ground floor. North west cor-
ner of Beit Quad), or pop it in the internal mail addressed to "Felix".
Scoring
Your final score depends on how well your team matches with the eventual
first and second place candidates, scoring as follows:
10 Pts If your first choice player for any of the 4 positions wins first place
in that position.
8 Pts If your second choice player for any of the 4 positions wins second
place in that position.
5 pts If your first choice player for any of the 4 positions wins second
place in that position
OR: If your second choice player for any of the 4 positions wins first
place in that position.
2 pts If your first OR second choice player for one position wins first OR
second place in a DIFFERENT position. This docs NOT apply to
'None of the above' or 'New election' players.
