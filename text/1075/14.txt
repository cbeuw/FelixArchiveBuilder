14 LETTERS & EDITORIAL FELIX FRIDAY 17TH JANUARY
LETTERS TO FELIX
replied to by David Roberts
Bookstore: too little,
too late
Dear Felix,
Like many other people I am
deeply concerned about the effects
that closing the ICU bookshop will
have. I notice that the new
Waterstones bookshop is to sell sec-
ond-hand books... what will happen
to the excellent second-hand book-
shop which is run as a non-profit
making service by staff in the
physics department? I find it hard to
believe that Waterstones would pay a
student the cash value of a used text-
book, and then sell it on for exactly
the same price.
I am also concerned about the fate
of the ICU newsagents - it has been
mentioned that the new Waterstones
will be the only retail outlet on cam-
pus allowed to sell books, but what
about magazines, papers, greetings
cards and stationery? If college
authorities are genuinely concerned
about minimising the losses to the
Union, they will allow the
Newsagents to expand into the "old"
(at the moment, current) bookshop,
and allow them to continue selling
newspapers, magazines, snacks and
chemist goods as at present, and
allow them to extend their range to
cover the stationery items and greet-
ings cards currently sold by the
bookshop. If Waterstones is to take
over the newsagents as well, I for one
would seriously consider a boycott.
And I'm not a particularly political
animal.
Yours sincerely,
Helen-Louise Windsor
Dear Mr Feakes,
How is it that your paper only
reports important issues (ie. your
recent mournful piece about the clo-
sure of the Union Bookstore) when
they are dead and buried? Though it
is generally made out that all us IC
students are extremely apathetic, I,
for one, would have protested very
strongly against the tender of the
bookstore going to someone other
than our Union...but I didn't know.
Surely, your job is to keep the stu-
dent body of this college well-
informed....in advance.
Yours sincerely,
Joseph Sorenson
(See editorial, right)
Dear Felix,
I'd like to express my concerrn at
the reported closure of the Union
Bookstore. I agree with the ICU cen-
tre pages {Felix 1074) "The First
Nail in Your Union's Coffin?" I
found this article to be a purely neg-
ative one however....the question is
surely "How can we turn this
around?" The Union will have my
full support in actions opposing the
closure.
Yours Sincerely,
George Constantinides
For once campus opinion would
appear to be of one mind, with the
closure of the Union Bookstore
universally condemned. This
strong feeling now needs to be
turned into action, to ensure that
other Union retail outlets - notably
Da Vinci's and the Newsagents -
do not befall the same fate, leaving
Union funding totally at the discre-
tion of College. After all, if you
were trying to attract overseas stu-
dents, would you rather spend
money on refurbishing dB's or on
prestige groups like the boatclub?
IQ needs you
Dear St Mary's,
The point of this letter is to sell
ourselves to you and to get as many
of you to come as possible.
"Ourselves" are IQ (Imperial
Queers), the lesbian gay and bisexu-
al society at IC, and we'd like to see
more of you medics. This term,
we've got a speaker from Stonewall
coming, and video evenings and
nights out planned. You've already
missed our pubcrawl, and last
Tuesday we had a blinding party at
dB's , with all the other London uni-
versity gaysocs.
Our regular meetings are on
Tuesday evenings at 7.30pm in the
charmingly titled Brown Committee
Room, on the top floor of the Union
(in Prince Consort Road). We know
it's a hassle crossing the park, but
there's a lot on offer over here.
Hope to see you and the rest of us
together soon,
Steven and Karen

BOOKSTORE COVERAGE
It was not my original intention to
weight the content of last week's
issue so heavily in favour of the
events surrounding the Bookstore
tender, but with the addition of the
Union's advert it was unavoidable.
However, it does seem to have elicit-
ed a response, not only from those
whom have written letters, but also
in a number of people who have
approached members of the Union
staff to express their sympathy.
In answer to Joseph Sorenson's
point (see letter, left) that there
should have been more coverage
before, rather than after the event, I
would say that it is easy to be wise
with hindsight. This is something
that ourselves at Felix, and the rest
of the Union, should have pursued;
highlighting the repercussions of not
winning the tender (and the benefits
of being successful), and generally
raising the Union's members'
awareness of what the Union actual-
ly does.
This obviously didn't happen.
The Union's approach to the tender
could be described as "play by their
[the College's] rules, and hopefully
they will make the right choice [ie,
us]", though I should stress that I
have no idea what their actual policy
was, it merely seemed "softly, soft-
ly" (though again this could be with
the benefit of hindsight). As for
Felix, I can make the feeble excuse
for the newsteam that the ongoing
tender negotiations were not really
'news' as such. A new development
or a shock revelation would have
merited column inches, but a dull
report that "all is quiet on the
Bookstore Front" would hardly have
advanced Felix's readers knowl-
edge.
An investigative feature detailing
the pros and cons of the tender
process, what would happen if we
won and what would happen if we
lost would have been better. It would
even have been interesting, perhaps.
But, unfortunately the time has past
and now the Union must be forward
looking in its actions and trading
activities.
One last word on this subject. All
of those who say that they would
have joined in any action that
opposed the closure of the
Bookstore, to what lengths would
you have been prepared to go?
FANTASY SABBATICAL
LEAGUE
In the centre pages of this week's
issue you may have noticed a bold
feature entitled "Fantasy Sabbatical
League" offering prizes to the those
who can pick a winning combina-
tion of candidates in the forthcoming
sabbatical elections (yes, it's that
time of year again).
This is not a joke feature, as some
people who have seen the concept
thought. It is quite genuine, as are
the prizes; I'm sitting here now
occasionally thumbing the tickets. It
is meant to be a fun competition
though, similar to certain lesser
games run in other newspapers. So
go on, have a go, you might even
