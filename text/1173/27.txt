S
orry for my absence in the
back end of last term, but I
was disheartened by the lack
of response to the column. Having
spoken to people since though, I've
realised that the number who write
in are only a fraction of those who
actually enjoy reading the column
and more importantly we have
another challenge.
T h e C h a l l e n g e
"Living over an hour's journey
from Imperial, I find it particularly
difficult to get home after a good
night on the tiles. I've often thought
of just booking into a hotel to col-
lapse in my drunken stupor, but with
the prices as high as they are
around South Ken, I've never been
able to afford even the smallest sin-
gle. Blag yourself a room in a classy
hotel and make sure there's no
preparation needed so next time i
go to the Union I can get myself a
room (it's either that or pull and go
home with someone from the
Union, you've got to help.)"
Although I haven't fried blag-
ging this in London yet, at the time
of the challenge I found myself in
Winchester, home of the renowned
Hotel Du Vine, one of the top
hotel/restaurants in the country. I'd
heard of the hotel before, having
recently read an article in the Tele-
graph on the standard of the food,
interviewing the head chef Andy
something, about his work; this was
all the ammo I needed.
To bo a good blaggcr it is
essentials that you are a master of
the three C's: Coolness, Conviction
and Confidence. When lying you
also must ensure that the web of
deceit that you are spinning can not
be traced or checked. Although I
have blatantly lied to people before
for the sake of a blag, this was the
first time I have ever tried to con-
vince someone face to face, know-
ing that there are huge odds
stacked against them believing me
and that they could find out the
truth, within minutes, if they were
sceptical.
After iast orders, having
empowered myself with a little '
Dutch courage, I walked into the
Hotel, slightly dishevelled, with the
look of an embarrassed lame dog.
Unfortunately my flat mate had dis-
appeared with my keys (most likely
to his girlfriend's house miles away)
and as a consequence I was locked
out of my flat. Given that I worked in
the hotel's kitchens as a pot washer,
I was hoping thot the hotel would
put me up for the night in one of
their spare rooms, as my only other
alternative was to sleep rough, after
all the hotel is like a family. They
then asked for my name and they
said they'd never heard of me, so I
explained that I'd only been working
for a few weeks as a favour to Andy
the head chef; feasible.
This is the point at which I could
have been buggered, but because
of the time, everyone had finished in
the kitchens and the officey-type
people had long gone home lock-
ing up al! of the employer details, or
so I assume. I was then asked to
wait so they could check on their
database to see which rooms were
vacant and I had my doubts for a
while, in spite of my Oscar-winning
performance. They came to nothing
though and I was handed my key to
one of their rooms, out the door
second on the right. Jackpot, it-was
a double, stuffed full of booze, jelly
beans and dried almonds, but I felt
far too guilty to help myself and if I
was caught, the cost of the minibar
could tip the balance between a
laugh and a felony in the manager's
eyes.
The only downside to this blag
is that unlike other blags, the blag-
ger has to leave himself vulnerable
for a prolonged period of time,
sleeping with the evidence. Para-
noid, but content with what I had
achieved I woke at 7.30, leaving in
the most discreet manner possible,
to stay any later would be taking the
piss and would run the risk of the
manager figuring out what had:
happened.
If you have any challenges or
have any blags that you're proud of,
that you want to see appearing in
this column, drop me an email at
