IC Sinfonietta's second evening
concert of the year took place at the
end of last term, with all those
involved hoping to build on the
undoubted success of their first per-
formance, which took place last
autumn.
For their first piece, the Sinfoni-
etta selected Tchaikovsky's Violin
Concerto. They were joined by Eliz-
abeth Cooney, a Foundation Schol-
ar at the Royal School of Music. She
performed with great aplomb,
bringing out the lyrical solo sections
of the first movement. During these
moments the audience listened in
awed rapture, scarcely daring to
breathe lest they missed a nuance.
The orchestra shone too, perform-
ing with clarity and purpose, espe-
cially in the later movements. The
final movement, Allegro
vivaa'ssimo, was a rapid sequence
of folk-dances, in which the main
theme was supported by bagpipe-
style droning and an evocation of
the gypsy string bands which were
popular in Tchaikovsky's Russia.
This was as fine a musical perform-
ance as this reviewer has ever wit-
nessed from IC Sinfonietta.
After the interval, the orchestra
prepared to do battle with (K)ein
Sommernachtsiraum, (Not) A Mid-
summer Night's Dream. The piece
began simply enough with some
toing-and-froing between two sim-
ple tunes, one on piano and violin,
the other on flute and harpsichord.
Later apparent chaos ensued as the
theme is repeated by the strings a
beat apart, accompanied by the
flutes in a different key. It is fair to
say that this sounded odd. In fact
many of the audience laughed
openly. A lengthy section followed in
which the strings introduced a rela-
tively sane waltz like theme, only to
have in thrown back in their faces by
the brass and winds as a thunder-
ous "oom-pah" march. This piece
worked well both as a musical per-
formance and as a comic episode.
Congratulations are due to conduc-
tor Daniel Capps who held together
the disparate rhythms admirably.
Finally, after some shuffling and
rearrangement, we were treated to
Malcolm Arnold's Four Scottish
Dances. This composer has worked
on films including Wildcat's of St.
Trinians and The Bridge on the River
Kwai. His Scottish Dances include a
Strathspey, a reel, a particularly
enjoyable Hebridian folk tune and a
Highland Fling. The orchestra clear-
ly relished the familiar timbres and
musical language of Scottish music,
and gave a fun interpretation of the
piece.
IC Sinfonietta has been running
for three and a half years, and until
this year it was kept under the wing
of the Symphony Orchestra. Its
many free lunchtime concerts were
well attended, but as the orchestra
grew bigger and better it needed to
perform to a wider audience. For

Sinfonietta or forthcoming concerts,

Okay, to those of you who didn't
attend "The sICk night In", would you
be so kind as to form an orderly line
by that wall over there, yes, the one
pitted with lead, clotted hair and
mucus. Lovely.
Saturday 1 8th March saw Lon-
don's biggest student rock and metal
night in the Union, attracting students
from as far out. as Surrey and
Uxbridge, in addition to all the major
London universities. Having almost
been cancelled twice and been
moved from DBs to the Concert Hall,
"The sICk night In" was put together
in a mere two and a half weeks of
hard work by a crack team from the
IC RockSoc, DramSoc and the Union
Bar. The result was best characterised
at the end of the night by brain
stunned people asking for more (and
offering to bear our children, nice).
The night kicked off a little after
the advertised 6pm, due to unfore-
seen technical difficulties concerning
custard and rice crispies, with a
selection of DJs from ICUs very own
RockSoc, in its first year as an official
society. RCM-based band Element
were first to play at 7pm, regaling us
with excellent renditions of a selec-
tion of classic songs.
The second band were exciting
upcomers in the London hard-core
scene, RD.H.M. (no, we haven't got a
clue as to what it stands for either).
The rapping brothers, Stuart and
Alistair, burst onto the stage in a wild
frenzy of unconstrained energy never
before seen in IC and with their per-
formance the first mosh pit of the
evening quickly got underway, with a
stage froth flailing of limbs and hair.
RedHed were next on. With already
one Kerrang! feature under the belt,
we knew we were in for a treat. With
an awesome stage presence, they
had the audience eating out of their
hands with their guitary Stuck Mojo
sound, singing along in no time.
Stonking.
The fourth band, on at
1 1 :30pm, were Evil Kneval. This
band is already very known for play-
ing support for major bands around
the UK. However no amount of
preparation can prepare a person for
the "my one is bigger than your one,
oh look, I'll whip it out and show
you" band debate. The music was
pretty cool too...
Headlining the night were Zeta
Reticuli. With a fantastic entrance,
the devil-winged front man Gary
wooed the audience with eerily
heartfelt tracks and a refreshing fast
moving sound.
Remember kids, you don't have
to worship Satan to join RockSoc, but
it does help and he is your friend.
The date for "The bigger, longer and
uncut sICk night In" has already set
for Freshers Week 2000 - put a note
in your diary and be there OR ELSE...
