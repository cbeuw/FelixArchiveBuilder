at a cost of £230 million, and as
such it is believed that any threat to
its future may cause concern
amongst government figures and
senior NHS administrators who are
fearful of a major loss of face
should such an expensive construc-
tion be made redundant so soon.
However, with Imperial regarded as
the major driving force behind the
project (viewing a major centre for
medical research, focused on a sin-
gle campus, as the only way in
which the College can compete
internationally), powerful lobbies
are thought to be at work on both
sides.
Any decision on the future of the
Chelsea and Westminster will not
need to be made for some time, as
work on the new structure, to be
constructed next to the existing St
Mary's building, is not due to begin
until 2005.

HOLLY BARNES
The latest plans for the massive
£300 million renovation of the St
Mary's site threaten to completely
subsume the Chelsea & Westminster
Hospital, as well as forcing the clo-
sure of the Royal Brompton and
Harefield Hospitals.
The National Heart and Lung
Institute (currently at the Brompton
site) and specialist children's surgery
services will be incorporated into the
new "Super Hospital" according to
plans set to go to public consulta-
tion soon. Doctors are worried that
the loss of the surgery will reduce
the integrity of the hospital, despite
reassurances that other services will
replace it. Although the intention to
close the Brompton and Harefield
has been known since the unveiling
of the plan, the threat to the
Chelsea and Westminster threatens
to stir up increased controversy.
The Chelsea and Westminster is
London's newest teaching hospital,
having opened just seven years ago

LEAGUE TABLE LATEST
The latest Times G o o d University
G u i d e league table has once
again placed Imperial College in
second place overall, behind
Cambridge. A more detailed
breakdown, published in the Times
Higher Education Supplement,
shows that Imperial has the best
staff-student ratio in the country,
as well as a good teaching assess-
ment score and high spending per
student. However, Imperial award
relatively few first and upper sec-
ond class degrees compared to
other leading institutions, and only
40% of staff work in teaching or
research.
ERASMUS IMBALANCE
Fewer UK students are taking up
Erasmus places to study in Europe,
while more European students are
choosing to study here. Only
9 9 9 4 British students took up
placements last year, compared to
1 1 9 9 8 in 1994-95. Poor lan-
guage skills and an insufficient
grant are blamed. In contrast, 2 0
769 Erasmus students came to
Britain in 1997-98, an increase of
around 2500 since 1994-1995
PRAYER R O O M PROBLEMS
The future of the Islamic Prayer
Room is uncertain after a meeting
between ICU, the Islamic Society
and College Administration. The
planned site, part of the Union's
developments of the Beit base-
ments, was vetoed due to its prox-
imity to the Union bars. It was felt
that this would be a particular
problem on Fridays.
KINGS BIG BUILDING
Kings College's new Franklin-
Wilkins building, which was
opened by the Princess Royal on
22 March, will hold 4500 stu-
dents, making it the largest univer-
sity building in London. Recently
refurbished for £ 5 0 million, the
building will house the Schools of
Health and Life Sciences, Nursing
& Midwifery and Education.
BEIT Q U A D C L O S U R E
Access to Beit Q u a d is likely to be
restricted over the weekend of 13-
1 4 May. This is to allow the crane
currently situated in the Q u a d to
be removed by contractors Long-
ley. The date has yet to be con-
firmed - check next week's Felix or
look for notices in the Union.
STUDENTS S H O T AT
Friday night revellers in the Union
over the Easter break got more
than they bargained for when they
were repeatedly shot at as they
walked past the Royal School of
Mines. An unknown assailant fired
a paintball gun at them after they
left Beit Q u a d . Although they
avoided the volley, the building
was hit several times by green
paint. Police are investigating the
incident, and think that the shots
were fired from the Albert Hall
Mansions, across the road. A
police spokesman said that they
had identified a suspect and that
an arrest was imminent.
