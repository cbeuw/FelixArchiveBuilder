The Imperial College Mountaineer-
ing Club's Easter tour took us to
Spain's Gold Coast, the Costa Dau-
rada in Catalonia, for a week and a
half of stunning climbing in fabu-
lous scenery.
The trip started in patriotic style,
with a late-night viewing of The Ital-
ian Job, which took the place of
sleep before the 7.00 flight from
Stanstead to Barcelona. We spent
most of the holiday quoting it, espe-
cially after picking up the blue,
white and (unfortunately) green
Clios that would be our transport in
Spain ("Remember, over here they
drive on the wrong side of the
road"). O n e of these, incidentally,
would be thrashed to within an inch
of its life over mountain roads and
dirt tracks, "because it's a hire car,
and they expect it to be trashed."
One car stayed in Barcelona to
pick up two latecomers, while the
others drove to the mountain refuge
in the ruined village of La Mussara,
which was to be our home for the
next ten days. The refuge provided
impressive views over the mountains
to the coastal town of Reus, with the
Mediterranean stretching away over
the horizon. Run by a Catalan cou-
ple, it provided basic accommoda-
tion and good food for a few
pounds a night. O u r two Spanish
speakers, Martin and Alban, spent a
long time talking to Maria, our
young hostess. Her boyfriend, pos-
sibly called Mario, seemed nice
enough too; he climbs F8a (read,
seriously hard) and puts up a lot of
new routes. Which was a shame.
The climbing started in earnest
on Sunday, with a trip to the nearby
TV crags, named after the masts on
the hill above them. The rock here is
a hard limestone, often covered in
sharp pockets or protrusions that
make for great technical climbing.
O n the other hand, anyone who
insisted on wearing shorts whatever
the weather ended up with knees
covered in cuts and grazes. This
didn't slow us down though, as
everyone set about the rock with a
determination caused by a long,
cold English winter. Everything here
is sports climbing - bolts drilled into
the rock provide a more secure and
regular form of protection than tra-
ditional British routes - so we
climbed as hard as we could with-
out quite the same risks we would
expect at home. There was a fair
amount of exposure though, the
almost instinctive unease that affects
most people when they're above
the ground. Hanging on by one
hand while you look down two
thousand feet of valley, going all the
way down to the distant sea, is an
interesting experience, generally
accompanied by muttered exple-
tives and a strong motivation to
keep going.
Thinking of the weather, anyone
who had been expecting balmy sun
and the chance to really work on
their tan was sorely disappointed -
we were a thousand metres above
sea level and it was extremely cold
at times. The wind didn't help - it
certainly didn't seem to have come
from the Sahara. Still, when we
found a bit of shelter, it was a beau-
tiful location.
We had three days of great
climbing, the highlight of which was
a stunning F7a+ arete led by Simon
and Mike on a crag called Lo Soter-
rani, although everyone was push-
ing their abilities and a lot of great
routes were climbed. Unfortunately,
we were now collectively tired, and
decided that a rest day in Tarrago-
na, the nearest city, was called for.
We went medium in Reus (which, on
a Tuesday at least, was too dead to
go large), and got shouted at for
being noisy when we returned at
half past two. We returned via Reus,
and picked up our esteemed Presi-
dent, Megan, and some random
slapper by the name of Nigel, who
had come to catch the second half
of the trip.
We headed out to the pictur-
esque village of Mont Ral on Thurs-
day, and managed a couple of
routes before the heavens opened
and we were reduced to huddling in
a cafe, cursing the filthy foreign
weather. Friday was much nicer, and
we managed a good few routes on
the TV crags.
Friday night presented some-
thing of a problem. The Catalonia
Rally was being held in the area,
and the refuge had been booked by
around sixty locals for a pre-race
party, leaving us with no option but
to go clubbing in Tarragona. After a
pizza, a few beers, and several jugs
of sangria, we were ready to go. But
wait! Look! A playground with those
wooden toys on springs to play on!
Nice. Unfortunately, someone had
to fall off, and Nigel took on this
solemn responsibility not once but
twice, losing a fair bit of skin from
around his eyes, which left him
looking like he'd been in a series of
brutal fights. Pausing only to pick up
an ice pack, we stumbled across a
row of a dozen clubs, thronging
with people and playing a wide
selection of music. Shame that most
of them didn't like trainers. Despite
this we had a great night, and
weren't too bothered about the
prospect of sleeping in the cars for
a few hours afterwards.
The roads were closed for the
Rally on Saturday, so we had a nice
afternoon on some nearby crags
that made up in route quality what
they lacked in height. Sunday was
an expedition to Villanova de
Prades, which had different rock
and lots of nice short routes. Unfor-
tunately our trusty Rockfax let us
down and we spent so long trying to
find the crag that we only managed
a couple of routes before the cloud
came down, the wind picked up,
and we retreated to a cafe. All
except Nigel and Gareth, who
proved themselves to be the least
sane but most hardcore of us all,
climbing a reasonably hard route in
ludicrously high winds. That night
was Megan's 21st birthday, which
called for a suitable celebration:
cocktails, tequila and general hilar-
ity. The precise details are lost in a
haze of alcohol and dire threats, but
a fine night was had by all.
Monday was our last day of
climbing, and we tried to make the
most of it, with some great routes
that left everyone tired but reluctant
to leave. After a truly fantastic meal
and the last of our beer, we left the
refuge on Tuesday and made our
way back to Barcelona. It had been
a fantastic few days, leaving us
looking forward to a long summer
of climbing back in Britain.
