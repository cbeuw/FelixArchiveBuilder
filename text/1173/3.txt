After several false starts and alter-
ations to the initial plan, it's now all
systems go for this year's ICU Sum-
mer Ball.
Having initially opted to return to
Alexandra Palace, home to the last
two balls, the Summer Ball Commit-
tee has now decided to hold the
event at the Paragon Hotel. Although
the decision was primarily made on
grounds of cost - a total loss in
excess of £10 000 was projected for
a return to last year's venue - ICU
Deputy President (Finance and Ser-
vices) Ian Clifford suggested that a
move to the Fulham venue also
brings with it several other advan-
tages, such as proximity and a lower
ticket price. Union President Tasha
Newton confirmed this buoyant out-
look, promising that this year's event
will be "really super duper".
Although a date of Saturday 24
June was tentatively agreed before
Christmas, several changes of plan -
caused by the need for adequate

time to set-up the planned Ents,
including a band, disco and casino -
have eventually led to Friday 23
June, one week before the end of
term, being chosen. Tickets will cost
£45 and should go on sale on Mon-
day 15 May. A three course meal,
champagne reception, assorted
entertainments and "lots and lots of
wine" will all be included in the price.
After last year's massive losses,
one of the major concerns for Mr
Clifford is ensuring that the event
cannot possibly lose money, so the
scale of the Ball has been consider-
ably reduced. Around 450 - 5 0 0
tickets will need to be sold in order
for the event to break even. Howev-
er, the hotel's owners have set a limit
of 850 people on their "Enterprise
Suite", which means that, at full
capacity, around 500 fewer revellers
than last year will be able to attend.
In order to make sure that the
event runs as smoothly as possible in
future years, the current sabbatical
team has already begun planning for
the 2001 Summer Ball, which is like-
ly to take place on Queen's Lawn. As
a result, Ms Newton was keen to
point out that this year's dinner will
be "the last to be held outside of the
College for some time... so I guess
it's really the year to go". Although
there are fears that much of the fun
of the event will be lost by a move
onto campus, Mr Clifford pointed
out several clear advantages to bas-
ing the Ball at South Kensington. In
particular, the event would be much
cheaper to run (as there would be no
charge for venue hire ), meaning that
ticket prices will be decreased and
Ents will be drastically improved -
indeed, this year's Summer Ball
would almost certainly have taken
place on site had it not been for the
ongoing building work.
Anyone who wants to be
involved in next year's Ball should

dent@ic.ac.uk.
