My mum's special Easter quadruple chocolate
layer cake with mint-eggs on top.
Batfenberg - sponge, marzipan and a nasty two
tone effect come together perfectly.
You can't go wrong with a Victoria Sponge.
Kendal Mint Cake. Not really a cake. Damn.
It's big. It's heavy. It's indigestible. It's fruit cake.

Buried three feet deep in icing and drowned in
alcohol, who really likes Christmas Cake?
