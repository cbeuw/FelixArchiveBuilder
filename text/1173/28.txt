Another term, another issue of Felix, another
fiendishly difficult crossword... or something
ike that. To be honest, I find the Sun's Tea
Break Quickie a bit taxing on the old grey
matter, so I always find Turnip Henry's offer-
ings damnably tricky. And it's for the likes of
me that he's once again provided a set of
what he likes to describe as "quick" clues
(hmmm... that just makes me feel thicker than
the large print version of The Lord of the
Rings). Either that or he's got terminally bored
with the prospect of revision - take your pick.
As ever, both sets of clues come with prizes
attached for the first correct set of solutions
out of the hat - just remember that, to ensure
that there's no cheating, the two sets of clues
are for different words (yet both using the
same grid - clever, huh), so you're effectively
getting two puzzles for the price of one. Which
is nice.
So, anyway, back to the normal spiel... put
down your notes and the painfully boring text
book (you know you want to) and ignore the
hideously attired man at the front of the room
talking about partial differentia! equations
(where do they get those ties?). Instead, dig
out a dictionary, locate a sharp pencil (and a
sharper mind) and set to work one of the puz-
zles (not both at the same time, mind - that
X r o s s w o r d
C o m p e t i t i o n
way madness lies).
In order to be in with a chance of winning,
you'll need to bring your completed grid to the
Felix Office (outside the Physics Department,
next to the liquid nitrogen tank) by 8pm on
Wednesday evening (preferably accompanied
by a full set of correct answers). O h , and it'd
help matters a lot if you indicate clearly which
set of clues you've used.
The first correct grid of answers to the
cryptic clues will win their owner a copy of the
Collins English Dictionary (RRP £20), whilst a
full set of solutions to the quick crossword
could earn you a £ 1 0 book token. The names
of the lucky winners will be printed here next
week, along with a full set of answers to both
crosswords.
Right, just one thing left to do... The final
crossword of last term produced the usual
stream of entries, with a particularly high
number of solutions for the quick crossword
materialising in the Felix Office just minutes
before the competition deadline, all looking
suspiciously similar... Anyway, after weeding
out all the incorrect answers (the correct
words are listed above), the first set of cryptic
answers out of the hat belonged to Will
Blackman, whilst the winner of the quick
crossword contest was Amy Hollister. Con-
gratulations - please come to the Felix Office
to collect your prizes as soon as possible.
