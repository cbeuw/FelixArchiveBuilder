So, whilst you've all been away
busily revising, what have I been
doing with myself? Well, tempting
as it is to say bugger all, that's not
quite the case (although I have to
admit that I really don't feel like
I'm doing enough to earn my
salary right now). As you may have
noticed from the ad on page
seven, Felix has finally made it's
way onto the internet. G o o d the
site undoubtedly isn't, and if any of
you have any decent suggestions
for improvement (or if you spot
any bits that don't work) please
email them to me at the usual
address. Just try to be reasonably
kind, because I'm trying to learn
HTML as I go at the moment, and
my current understanding could
undoubtedly be described as a big
pair of emperor^size pants. Any-
way, if you're feeling kind, tap in
www.su.ic.ac.uk/felix and have a
look.
O n an unrelated note, you've
probably read copious amounts
about the meltdown in internet
stocks over the holidays. Personal-
ly, I find the fact that zMicrosoft
has lost half it's value since Christ-
mas, 70% has been wiped off last-
minute.com since launch and Bill
Gates is no longer the world's
richest man is hilarious. After all,
none of this will effect the financial
status of the world (the fact that
the FTSE and NYSE indexes didn't
go into freefall admirably proved
that), but it has given the " N e w
Economy" a much needed kick in
the backside that may finally per-
suade them to play by some nor-
mal financial rules (like profitabili-
ty). Then again, pigs might fly.

And so we reach the final term.
With just nine weeks to go, it's
time for heartbreak, joy, relief,
hard work and exasperation to
sweep incessantly over us, over-
lapping and interweaving until
individual emotions become
impossible to distinguish... O r at
least it would be if this were all
one big episode of Dawson's
Creek. This being Imperial, what
we actually get is lots of exams,
lots of coursework and precious
little time off to realise that the sun
is shining, we're young, free and
(mostly) single, and we're based
smack-bang in the middle of Lon-
don;
I expect that most of you are
panicking like crazy right now
(unless you're in Biochem or Biol-
ogy, and are on a completely dif-
ferent timescale to the rest of us),
with a big stack of exams coming
up in the next few weeks (or, worse
still, days), Just remember that (a)
you're at one of the best universi-
ties in Europe, which means that
you're definitely not as stupid as
you think you are; (b) your exams
are being set by your lecturers,
who aren't going to look too good
if you all fail and will want you to
pass; and (c) if you've done some
work in the last six months, you'll
have to try very hard to actually
fail the year.
Finally, I think this is where I'm
supposed to offer some sage
words of advice from the point of
view of someone who's "been
there, done that, got the certifi-
cate", but as I ended up with a
2:2, I don't imagine that you'll
take much notice of my suggesting
that you don't take any of this too
seriously. Nonetheless, it's
undoubtedly worth remembering
that there is more to life than a
degree result, and that life isn't
going to come and swallow you
up if you don't get 90%. Sure, we
were all used to getting bucket
loads of 'As back at school, but
we can't all be top of the class at
university. So, do your best, have a
bit of fun along the way and get a
result that you're happy with.
My god, I really am beginning
to sound like a parent. Help...
