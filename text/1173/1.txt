The planned redevelopment of the
Southside halls of residence has
been postponed "until mid 2 0 0 1 " ,
after a reassessment of the project
by Imperial College Estates.
The delay was announced at a
meeting of College Council at the
end of last term. The project as a
whole has not been delayed,
according to John Walsh, the
Assistant Director of Projects in the
Estates Department, only the con-
struction itself. There will be a
greater "lead in" time, which will
allow the project to be planned in
finer detail. This, in turn, will
improve the efficiency of the con-
struction and allow for contracting
to be finalised before building
work starts.
Estates are currently reviewing
the timescale for the construction
in light of the improved planning,
and hope to minimise the period
for which the halls are out of com-
mission. This means that only
Willis Jackson House, in Evelyn
Gardens, is due to undergo reno-
vation in the next academic year,
easing the pressure on spaces in
halls and allowing the College to
fulfil its promise to offer accom-
modation to all first year under-
graduates.
Part of Estates' rationale in
delaying the Southside project was
to "safeguard our financial expo-
sure", as there are several so-
called "capital projects" underway,
including the refurbishment of the
Southside: open for another year
Senior Common Room and the
construction of the Multi-Discipli-
nary Research Building (MRDB).
Imperial College's recently-pub-
lished Annual Report includes
descriptions of these and other
planned projects, but the South-
side redevelopment is not listed;
neither are the other "rolling refur-
bishments" of Imperial's halls of
residence.
Beryl Castle, College's Direc-
tor of Finance, denied rumours
that financial problems were to
blame for the changes, as the
projects were never intended to be
funded directly from College
funds. Indeed, in his introduction
to the Annual Report the Rector,
Lord Oxburgh, states that progress
"will depend on our ability to find

around £200 million outside the
College". Ms Castle stated that the
capital projects were proceeding
according to the College's long-
term plans, citing the MRDB as a
prime example of a development
that is working well.
However, the introduction of a
new, £ 6 million finance system
appears to have caused some
short-term cash flow difficulties.
Due to problems integrating the
new system with existing adminis-
tration systems, there have been
delays in processing the tuition
fees bills, which were not sent out
until December. Since fees and
support grants from Local Educa-
tion Authorities accounted for £34
million last year, some 10% of the
College's turnover, the delay in
their receipt caused a temporary
deficit when staff expenses were
paid each month. The problem
was compounded by the decision
to pay off around £3 million of
debts last July to ease the transfer
to the new system. Although there
have been no serious losses, and
the finances are set to recover as
debts are paid, the lack of capital
has reduced the profits made by
investing surpluses.
Meanwhile, the renovation of
Beit Hall looks likely to finish
slightly later than scheduled,
although Estates are "still looking
to maintain the end date", accord-
ing to M r Walsh. The delays are
associated with the problems of
working with old buildings, but are
unlikely to prolong the work great-
ly beyond the target of 1 July. M r
Walsh said that work on the base-
ments, which are to be developed
by Imperial College Union, should
not be delayed.
Contracts are "currently being
signed" for the first stage in the
Royal School of Mines makeover,
the conversion of Level 4 into new
offices. An "in-house strategy for
the whole building", rather than
the initial plan of renovating every-
thing at once, is now favoured.
Although this will still cost tens of
millions of pounds and take sever-
al years, it is less expensive and
disruptive than the alternative. The
costs have been inflated by the
need to maintain the front of the
listed building, which faces Prince
Consort Road.
