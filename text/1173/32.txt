Cross Country - Paris Relays 2000
Its that time of year again when
the cross country team decide to
blow the budget in Paris. There
were only two objectives of the trip
this year. The first was to get drunk
for three days and the second was
to win the naked 4-by-400 relay.
All the London colleges con-
gregated at ULU on Thursday
night for a couple of social drinks
before the coach journey out to
Paris. As always, the journey was a
rowdy one, with Kings Beer Fag
Army leading all the chants
(including a 55min rendition of
Chicago). This led one of the
Imperial girls (Sarah, a feminist
Yank) who had only been dragged
in at the last minute, to complain
continuously to the whole of the
team. O h well... The ferry journey
was enlivened by Andy G swiping
a hostess's hat when she came to
throw us out of the club lounge.
Anyhow, after we arrived on
Friday we went on the usual sight
seeing tour of Paris, which ended
with a club meal at which Sarah
complained loudly (you may have
spotted a pattern).
Saturday saw the strength of
the team increase, as three extra
runners turned up at the last
minute. The Paris Relay (the rea-
son we are meant to go) was held
in the afternoon, with Imperial
forced to borrow a group of
females from UAE (with them bor-
rowing some of our men in
return).
The race itself was uneventful
- we hadn't come here to win and
we didn't, with the first team fin-
ishing eleventh. Shaun should get
a mention, however, for running
the eight fastest time of the day in
his first outing for Imperial. The
post race celebrations started
immediately, however, with some
serious beer fights. The team then
moved onto the more serious rea-
sons for coming to Paris.
At 2.30am the naked 4-by-
400 started. Andy G ran a storm-
ing leg came in first and handed
onto Andy H, who ran a great leg
and was only beaten home by the
Nottingham runner who started
50m down the track and cut all
the corners off (you cheating
b*stards). G a v took over but was
unable to haul in the Nottingham
runner a n d handed over to
McDangerous, who closed the
gap but was unable to complete
the victory. Nottingham were
announced as the winners, but
only by the judge who came from
- you guessed it - Nottingham. All
the other teams disqualified Not-
tingham and Imperial were once
again crowned Kings of the
Naked 4-by-400.
The night continued, a n d
Frank Boucher had a hell of a
time at the party. After repeatedly
saying he did not like the moaning
feminist, he vanished to her room.
He claims she asked him for sex
and that he said no, but the gen-
eral consensus is that his new
name (Mister Floppy) might have
had something to d o with it...
A fantastic weekend was had
by all, and we arrived back at ULU
late on Sunday evening - what a
way to finish the season off. O n to
the athletics season now - and all
that remains is to see if Mike can
keep his progression going: thir-
teen year olds to incessantly
moaning American feminists to...?

Premiership League Review
Manchester United have taken the
Premiership title for the sixth time in
the league's eight year history - yet
after only reaching the last eight of
the Champions League and per-
forming miserably in the World Club
Championship, is that enough?
With the title wrapped up so
early this season, Alex Ferguson
surely only views the Premiership as
a way back into Europe next season
- after all, it's only through contin-
ued success on the European stage
that United will be able to conclu-
sively prove themselves to be one of
the greatest teams of all time. Until
then, no matter what an endless
succession of BBC and Sky Sports
commentators proclaim them to
be, they will still remain an impossi-
bly wealthy yet quickly forgotten
team.
Hence, you have to assume,
the decision to spend £18.5 million
on Ruud Van Nistelrooy. That and
the fact that Liverpool have picked
up just three points less than United
since Christmas (it was just one
point until they ran out of steam
against Everton on G o o d Friday),
and the one thing that the Mer-
sysiders definitely aren't short of is
strike force (unlike Chelsea and
Arsenal, who have fallen away from
the leaders largely thanks to an
inability to put the ball in the back
of the net). So, with the prospect of
Liverpool mounting a serious chal-
lenge next year (assuming that they
can hold onto all of their players
and keep them injury free), and,
more importantly, with the Champi-
ons League kicking off again in five
months time, making a few
improvements to the starting eleven
is clearly essential. However, with
Martin Edwards insisting that some-
one's going to have to leave in
order to balance the books, a nice
big argument between the Chair-
man and his short-of-fuse Manager
may well be on the horizon - and
that certainly won't be good for the
share price...
