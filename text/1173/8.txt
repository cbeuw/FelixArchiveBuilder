U take the pain out of coming to College with the launch of their campus-wide buddies system
The idea is this - every single incom-
ing fresher in the next academic year
will be paired up with a senior student
(the buddy) on the same course. The
buddies are to be drawn from the stu-
dent body of the second, third and
fourth year students on each course.
The intent is to maintain this scheme
and to keep it running in the years to
come, perfecting it and ironing out
any difficulties that may arise.
What would be the benefits of such a
scheme?
Our core aim is to make freshers
feel more welcome here. This is our
opportunity to reach out personally to
every fresher and give her or him an
immediate access point into the
department. A student in a higher
year is more likely to know who to talk
to regarding any matters of interest or
any problems. Moreover, the forming
of friendships between freshers and
students from higher years is impor-
tant to help build a spirit within the
departments that transcends year
groups.
Why should you become a buddy?
Well, why not? This is not going
to take up a lot of your time - it's not
a formal job or anything. You have a
great opportunity here to be of gen-
uine help to a grateful fresher coming
in - after all, you were in the same
boat a year or two before. Then
again, getting a bit cynical, doesn't it
look good on your C V to say you've
been in a position of responsibility?
Taking part could be seen as devel-
oping the key skills of organisation
and communication.
How can you get involved?
It's simple. The logistics involved
in handling this for your course are
being handled by your departmental
representative - the staff in every
department have already agreed to
help us run this scheme smoothly.
Most departments have already elect-
ed their dep reps for next year - you
can get in contact directly with your
dep rep right away

Aeronautical Engineering stu-

yet, but will be doing so soon. In the
meanwhile, get in contact with us at
guilds@ic.ac.uk directly if you're an
Aero student and want to be involved.
We need as many people as possible
in order to make the scheme work, so
please get in touch.
