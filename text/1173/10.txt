GREATER L O N D O N
AUTHORITY - Y O U DECIDE
Dear Felix,
I'd like to take this opportunity
to remind all your readers of the
importance of voting in the elec-
tions for the Greater London
Authority this Thursday.
Although the election of the
mayor has captured all of the
media attention, the role of the
twenty-five Assembly members is
just as important as that of the new
leader. When Ken Livingstone gets
in, as he surely will, it is they who
will control his actions and keep
him in line. It is they who will sit on
all of the new committees that will
control essential services and city-
wide planning in the capital. And it
is they who will ultimately be in
charge of the GLA's estimated
£3.3bn budget.
As you should all know - but
quite possibly don't, as a result of
the government's incredibly low
key campaign to explain how the
election will be run - every regis-
tered Londoner (including all EU
and Commonwealth citizens) will
have the chance to vote for both
constituency and party candidates.
The fourteen local Assembly Mem-
bers will be elected on a first-past-
the-post system, with votes cast in
the second ballot used to elect a
further eleven representatives to
create an overall position that
roughly mirrors the proportion of
votes cast for each of the principal
parties. The most important aspect
of this is that any party that gets
more than 5% of the total vote will
get a least one member into the
GLA - so it's really important that
you chose carefully which party to
vote for on each of the ballot
papers.
You can find out lots more
(including which electoral district
your home falls into and which
candidates are running in that con-
stituency) on the official G L A web-
site, www.london.gov.uk.
Thanks for listening,
Tom Harris

Dear Felix readers,
I would like to thank everyone
who took part in the survey to help
identify the most popular shops that
could be assigned space on the
walkway when the SCR is redevel-
oped. We received a total of 33
replies with some excellent sugges-
tions.
The clear favourite was a
supermarket type shop (Tesco was
the preferred supermarket) with
next favourite option being a
Chemist/boot's type of store. The
third most popular option was a
Computer store (this may just mean
that the C C S shop needs to do a
big ad's campaign as most of these
responses didn't seem to know that
it existed)! The fourth favourite
option was a hairdressers and this
was followed in quick succession by
an opticians.
You may also remember that
for every 25 people who participat-
ed one would get £101 The lucky
person who won the £1 0 prize was
Michelle Cope, the money will be
winging it's way to her very soon.
Thanks again to everyone who took
part, your ideas have been
immensely useful and will be
passed on to the estates division.
Yours truly,
Tim Trailor

Dear Felix,
Having just seen the latest set
of Times League Tables, I have to
begin to wonder about the way in
which this College is run.
It is a credit to Imperial that we
have the best student-staff ratio in
the land (although as an under-
graduate that statistic frequently
seems somewhat questionable), but
one other figure which was quoted
in the table severely worried me.
Firstly, the percentage of staff
whose "main function is teaching
and research" was a staggeringly
low 39.2% - it's frightening to think
that we have quite that many staff
involved in non-teaching roles.
Of course, many will be techni-
cal and ancillary support staff, but
nonetheless that must still leave us
with a phenomenal number of
admin staff - particularly when
compared to other universities in
the country. For example, Durham
manages to achieve a 63.2% score
and even LSE is 1 0% better off than
Imperial, with 49.1 % of their staff in
academic roles - and although I'm
sure that the College's shadowy
senior figures will rest happy in the
knowledge that we still ranked
higher than both Oxford and Cam-
bridge in this category, I'd hope
that the centuries old administrative
traditions of these frequently-
incomprehensible institutions aren't
being used as a model.
There's been a lot of talk of the
appointment of the new Rector
recently, with many people suggest-
ing that Imperial needs to be run by
a revered academic, not some
high-flying C E O . However, in light
of these numbers, let's hope that
the much-suggested leader of a
certain pharmaceutical firm does
indeed turn out to be Imperial's
new head, because some moderni-
sation and rationalisation of our
staffing and management structure
definitely seems to be what this
College needs if it is truly to com-
pete in the twenty-first century.
In hope,
Julie Potter
A N D FINALLY...
Dear Dave,
What the hell was all that Goat
Power stuff about last term? It made
absolutely no sense at all - surely
everyone knows that the real future
for Britain's power needs is glow in
the dark sheep...
