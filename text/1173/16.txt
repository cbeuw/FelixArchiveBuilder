Men
Lotus
(Epic)
The music of Merz is
unique, and there are
plenty of fans out there
who adore their tones.
However, the allure has
never quite managed to
capture me. Lotus is
nice enough, but it's
nothing to get excited
about. Maybe I'm miss-
ing something, but
probably not.
Toni Braxton
He Wasn't Man Enough
(Arista)
With the quality of r'n'b tunes rising
all the time, it's getting harder and
harder to get onto those much
desired radio playlists. However, this
latest offering from Toni Braxton has
had no trouble elbowing the compe-
tition out of the way. She may have
been away for four years, but there's
been no loss of talent and with any
luck her forthcoming album should
contain a few more gems.
MJ Cole
Crazy Love
(Talkin' Loud)
I think if you told me a year ago that
I'd be looking forward to the release
of a garage album, I would have told
you that you were insane. Anyway, for
some strange reason garage has
really grown on me recently and the
music of MJ Cole is no exception.
Crazy Love is an excellent single from
the top end of the garage spectrum
and I'll be first in the queue when the
album drops in a few weeks time.
I D
Hanson
If Only
(Mercury)
How can you not laugh at
Hanson? I mean, just
look at them. I suppose
they do what they do
quite well, but it's not
really music to fulfil the
body or mind. There is,
however, a lot of comedy
associated with the Han-
son boys, and as one of
the CDs comes with a
free poster this could be
worth buying for some-
thing new to stick of your
dartboard.
Calexico
Ballad of Cable Hogue
(City Slang)
Sometimes, you just
can't beat a good bal-
lad. Stan Ridgeway's
Camoflague was a firm
favourite of mine when I
was younger. This single
is in the country and
western style, with all the
usual touches, and, as
such, makes a nice
change from the rest of
this weeks singles. I sup-
pose the C & W style
could put a lot of peo-
ple off, but this is definit-
ley worth checking.
Funkstar De Luxe vs. Terry Max
Walkin' In The Name
(Edel)
Funkstar De Luxe was the guy who
brought us the undeniably excellent
remix of Bob Marley's Sun is Shin-
ing. Walkin' In The Name is not
quite up to the same standard, but
that's not say that this should be
avoided. The beat keeps your head
bouncing and the lyrics are easy
enough to pick up, so don't be sur-
prised if you're singing this out
aloud in the forrthcoming weeks.
Utah Saints
Funky Music
(Echo)
Song titles should in general give an
impression of what a song is about
or what it sounds like. The Utah
Saints classic that we all know and
love was called Something Good
and good it was indeed. Funky
Music, their latest comeback single
is neither funky nor is it particularly
musical. So I suggest a trip to a
vocabulary school (or better still a
retirement home) is about due for
these self claimed Saints.
Cuban Boys
Inertia Kicks
(EMI)
I don't understand the
motivation behind these
Cuban Boys singles.
The chorus is a self
defacing chant of
"we're just a bunch of
losers" (which makes a
change from hamsters),
but the construction is
so basic and obvious
that after just a few lis-
tens I'm bored and
want more. I think I pre-
ferred the hamsters.
