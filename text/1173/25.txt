Hero in the Shadows
David Gemmell
This is the first David Gemmell book I have read and it certainly makes me
wish I'd picked one up much earlier, as this is easily the best book I have read
in ages. In fact, this is the third book to contain GemmeH's Waylander char-
acter - but fear not if you, like me, have not read the other two, as this is a
complete story within itself (somewhat novel in the fantasy genre that tends
to specialise in epics). There are references to previous books, but they are
smoothly explained and don't leave you with that irritating feeling that you're
missing out on something important.
From the first paragraph you are plunged into the action of a savage village
raid and things just never stop from there on. Even if you are someone who
only reads occasionally, I defy you to be able to put this book down and not
be itching to get back to it. Perhaps not such a good thing before exams,
but definitely a good aid to relaxation afterwards.
To fill you in a bit on the plot: Waylander, the retired prince of assassins, must
do battle against cruel sorcerers and their demonic minions to prevent his
world being over run by an ancient evil. To his aid come friends both old and
new - Kysumu, a 'Rajnee' swordsman of a dying order; Yu Yu Liang, a sim-
ple ditch-digger with dreams of fame and heroism; Usarte, a powerful half-
breed priestess and Keeva Taliana, a peasant girl with uncanny weapon
skills. Together they must wake the dead Rjor-nor warriors to restore the wan-
ing magic of the portal that holds the terror of Huan Kador out of their
realm. But dissent has already been sown amongst the avaricious local
nobility, is there a traitor in their midst?
The plot is excellent, neatly drawing all the storylines together at the end. The
only fault lies in perhaps relying a little too much on chance. His characters,
however, more than make up for this as they are all rounded and believable.
Gemmell allows them to deal with real human difficulties in a way that shows
genuine understanding. Waylander, feared and hated by many for his fabu-
lous wealth and direct manner, must come to terms with his own hidden
character and actions past and present.
Somewhat surprisingly, Gemmeli's first attempt at fiction writing was met with
unusual scorn from'one agent. He was advised to continue working as a
lorry driver's mate for Pepsi Cola as it was 'a career not without merit'. How-
ever, twenty-one books and over one million sales later David Gemmell has
been praised from all quarters as one of fantasy's greatest writers.
