Q Sailing
The IC t e a m were again tip at the H a r p to
sail U L s second team, which contained two
defectors Irom Imperial. Alter obvious ploys
by a "heavyweight" U L 2 team to delay
the start of racing due to the light wind, they
were persuaded to take to the water, they then
proceeded to beat the I C team in two races by
15.5 points to IC's 26. U L 2 did however
c o n t a i n one e x - B r i t i s h U n i v e r s i t i e s t e a m
member, so the result should not perhaps be
t a k e n as such a b a d r e f l e c t i o n on I C ' s
performance as might at lirst appear.
Team: Ajderian, Kennedy, Redman, Toslevin,
1 ounghusband.
§ Rugby
Firsts
H a v i n g been let down by the Police on
Wednesday we were about to get extremely
unamused when at last F o r d Sports turned
up.
T h e match was really a non-event from the
point ol view ol good rugby, as F o r d Sports
m a i n o b j e c t i v e seemed to be r e m o v i n g
peoples heads. However, some good running
from the backs gave Steve Thompson two
w e l l - w o r k e d t r i e s , a n d i n g e n e r a l I C
controlled the game through their superior
litmus.
Unfortunately it was a difficult game to
H e a l in all seriousness and no doubt our
lixtui'es secretary will omit this team Irom the
fixtures list next year.
P r e p a r a t i o n l o r the G u t t e r i d g e C u p
(|iiai ter-linal is well under way with practices
on Sunday. M o n d a y and Tuesday. W e all
hope tn put a good p e r f o r m a n c e i n on
Wednesday and get the result that I think the
it ,un deserves through their hard w o r k —
good luck lads.
T h e S p o r t s E d i t o r (who denies being a
power crazed meglomaniac) wishes to thank
the Football Firsts lor brightening up her
existence and hopes that their football is as
interesting as their reports. Carry on folks!

here are this week's lecture notes.

P. Niccolls + Links = V e r y Pissed.
C h a n g i n g Rooms + Lock - K e y = L o n g Wait.
M u m m y + U n k n o w n Daddy - Referee.
Hence: IC = R o y a l Holloway + Referee.
IC Front 3 + Shooting = G o a l K i c k .
Referee + R o v a l Hollowav + Offside = C o a l

Hence: S. W a r d - Brain + forearm smash

Hence: S. W a r d + Booking = Injured Opposi-

Fourths
T w o weeks after defeating Royal Holloway II
5-4 in the C u p , I C Fourths returned to beat
the same team by a more convincing margin.
Holloway were made to regret several
missed chances w h e n , alter a cross by
G l a d m a n , their keeper could only parry a
shot from M c N i c h o l a s a n d J o h n R i g b y
Ion eel in the rebound.
M c N i c h o l a s then gave an action replay oi
his goal a fortnight earlier when his twenty
yard drive dipped just under the crossbar.
R i c h D o l a n was unlucky when his penalty
kick hit a post, but Rigby was luckier when a
defensive mistake allowed h i m to hammer
the ball home for his eighth goal of the
season. Minutes later, he scored the ninth
with a looping header which the Holloway
keeper could only stand and admire.
T e a m : Slater, Higham, Maddy, Kindred,
Heath. Savage, Peplinski, Dolan, Gladman, Rigby,
Me. \ ieholas.
Hockey
Firsts
H a v i n g waited half an hour for our captain
we then followed him in a convov of three
cars to darkest Staines. Alter crossing the
wrong bridge, completing three U-turns, and
getting separated we finally all arrived at the
ground. It obviously wasn't going lo lie a
very good day!
R i g h t f r o m the start, Staines put the
College defence under pressure. G o o d work
by keeper Statter kept them out until we
allowed the home side some shooting practice
who eventually scored.
T w o minutes later Staines increased their
lead (no comment).
IC at last woke-up (what were you doing
Friday night, Bell?) and dominated the rest of
ihe lirst half (about live minutes) creating
some good chances but failing to convert
them.
A still' team talk at half-time did nothing to
improve the situation.
In the second half Franklin was "green-
carded" (jug!) and one of the Staines players
sent-oll. but still the I C side made little/no
impression on the home defence.
Staines scored a third in the closing stages
of the game and IC had to settle for second
place again.
T h a n k s to K a r e n a n d M a r i a n l o r

Team: Slaller, Coalesworlh, Parker, Franklin,
Riley, Clarke, Rao. Ayers, Pell, Pansal. Paleson.
Seconds
W h e n the running start to the Le M a n s 24hr
race was discontinued several years ago, the
race lost one of its distinctive qualities, rather
as if the gas holders outside the O v a l cricket
ground were to be dismantled. T h i s season
hockey has lost is bully-off, along with several
other a d j u s t m e n t s to l'he rules. H o c k e y
entered new realms in by trying to achieve
p a r i t y at its r e s t a r t s , ice h o c k e y a n d
basketball followed with the face-oil' and the
tip-off.
Imperial achieved a line running start on
Saturday, going into a three goal lead by
hall-time. W i t h a captain like Stroomer, who
in full llight resembles a full cavalry charge
by h i m s e l f , s u c h a b e g i n n i n g s e e m e d
appropriate. T h e game was at that stage over
as a contest. In the second period Imperial
were able to throttle back, ant! all hough O l d
M e r c h a n t T a y l o r s scored the p r o v e r b i a l
consolation goal we were able to cruise into
the M u l s a n n e Straight unhindered.
Farmer, Wylie and Mitchell (though not
necessarily in that order) scored for Imperial.
T e a m : Puller, Cunningham. Pilkethlv, Hughes,
Rampton, Roessink, Stroomer, Garms, Gray,
Parmer, Wylie, Mitchell.
