Neil Young
& Crazy Horse
Re-act-or
This is the first 'state-of-the-art' album from
Neil Young for quite some time, all the songs
being written in the year of release, unlike his
past three albums.
It also features Crazy Horse throughout and
I was tempted to say that its sameness was due
to Crazy Horse's lack of imagination but a
listen to their ' C r a z y M o o n ' p r o v e d that
wrong.
So is it Neil? Has time caught up with him at
last?
Well he no longer produces guitar classics
like Cowgirl, Hurricane or Cortez, but many of
his albums are classics without any of the
super 'guitar-hero' bit viz Goldrush, O n the
Beach, Tonight's the Night and Rust Never
Sleeps. A more plausible explanation is that
previously only two or three of the current
genre of songs appeared on each album so
really this album is a case of overkill and lacks
variety.
It starts promisingly with 'Opera Star' and
'Surfer Joe and Moe the Sleaze' but his most
uninspiring track ever brings the entire
machinry to a halt. Two lines 'Got mashed
potatoes/Ain't got no T-bone' are repeated in
various sequences over nine minutes of the
s a m e m u s i c — give me his c o u n t r y - r o c k
anyday!
Side two is a panorama of America (albeit
limited)—Detroit, public service employment,
the S o u t h e r n P a c i f i c R a i l r o a d a n d t h e
Midwest—its musical hero undoubtedly being
R a l p h M o l i n a with e x c e l l e n t d r u m m i n g
throughout, notably on S h o t s , a song of
enormous potential spoilt by Young's rough
and ready attitude to recording.
Generally Young fans will like this album
while others are entitled to ask what's all the
fuss about.
