CLUBS AND SOCIETIES
H.G. Wells Soc
Wellsoc will be showing another classic H . G .
Wells film on Monday as part of the R C S
Centenary celebrations.
The Man Who Could Work Miracles is
about what happens when the Giver of Power
is tempted into giving an earthling the power of
unlimited miracle working. This, of course,
leads to disasterous c o n s e q u e n c e s , with
infinite power corrupting infinitely with one or
two interesting chronologically out of joint
situations on the way.
The film was made in 1937 and (like Things
to Come) was scripted by H . G . Wells himself.
Alexander Korda directed this classic which is
best remembered for the cinematic effects
(which are by no means too old hat for more
sophisticated audiences of today) and Ralph
Richardson's marvellous portrayal of Colonel
Winstanly.
The Man who Could Work Miracles will be
shown on Monday, November 23 at 6:30pm in
Mech Eng 220.
Yacht
Last weekend's sailing was one of the most
eventful yet. Eleven sailors and two captains
manned two yachts, Quinta and Churchill,
both b e r t h e d at L y m i n g t o n . T h e weather
forecast p r e d i c t e d fair winds so we were
determined to get out of the Solent.
S a t u r d a y s a w us d r i f t i n g s l o w l y f r o m
Lymington to Studland Bay (near Poole) via
the Needles. Quinta did some nifty spinnaker
work and made fair progress but Churchill's
skipper took things more geriatrically. A t
Studland, Quinta's captain showed he was a
landluvver by steaming his yacht aground. The
evening's entertainment was mainly alcoholic
but there were also some jolly japes with
dinghies and buckets of water.
Sunday brought near perfect sailing weather
so at 6:40am we set off to go round the Isle of
Wight before returning to Lymington. Quinta's
captain, tempting fate, kept close to the island
all the way a n d sure enough they went
aground while doing 71
/2 knots with spinnaker
up. Both yachts got back to base at about
3:30pm.
So if you like the idea of yachting—offshore
or on shore (we have skippers which cater for
all tastes) why not come to meeting, 12:30pm
Thursdays in Botany C o m m o n Room (under
Beit Arch).
S F Soc
Here we are again. O h G o d . What have I got
to talk about this week. A h yes. Barrington J .
Bayley is coming to talk to us, on Thrusday,
N o v e m b e r 26 at 1 : 0 0 p m i n t h e G r e e n
Committee Room. Nice bloke, Barry. First
time I met him he bought an N M E 2. Written
some good stuff, too. I like "Soul of a Robot"
best, but others prefer "Full of Chronopolis".
Still, anyone who can reply to " H i , I'm Phillip"
with " H i , I'm pissed" can't be bad.
Re '200T Ents Quote: "sorry 'bout the
sound, but overseas buggered the amp." The
mind boggles.
You might like to know what the people who
were at last week's meeting chose as films for
next term. If you don't like it, remember you
could have helped choose if you'd come.
January 'Time After Time'; February 'Plan 9
from Outer Space' with 'Relativity'; March
'Carrie'; End of March Easter Bunny Special:
'Night of the Lepres' and 'Bugs Bunny Goes to
Mars'.
Life's a farce.
Liberal
O n Tuesday, November 24, there will be a
meeting of IC Liberals at 1:00pm in the Green
Committee Room. Items to be considered will
be the forthcoming visit of Stuart Mole, party
c a n d i d a t e for C h e l m s f o r d a n d p o l i t i c a l
assistant to David Steel; and the production
and articles for the next edition of 'Forward'. If
you have a complaint about I C U , government
c u t s , p a r t y p o l i t i c s , o r c a n c o m p i l e a
crossword, draw cartoons and basically have a
lot of talent, then come along. Forward is a
voice independent of the sabbaticals, so let's
have your views. B y the way, next year
sometime we hope to be holding a meeting in
conjunciton with S D P Soc at which David
Steel will be speaking.
Anti-Apartheid
In South Africa the white minority (one in four
or less) deprive black people of basic human
and democratic rights—the right to freedom of
speech and movement; the right to education,
housing and health; the right to vote. The
s y s t e m of A p a r t h e i d (meaning "separate
d e v e l o p m e n t " ) is supposedly designed to
enable various cultural and ethnic groups to
remain distinct and self-governing. In reality it
is the means by which the whites divide and
rule. The blacks' shanty towns are bulldozed
to the ground, and the blacks themselves are
forced into infertile "homelands" whether they
want to go "home" or not.
South Africa's economy laregly depends
upon the exploitation of mineral resources
(such as gold, diamonds and uranium from
Namibia) and to achieve this as economically
as possible the white South Africans depend
on the exploitation of cheap, black, frequently
migrant labour. Thus it is in the government's
interest to perpetuate institutionalised racism,
whatever they may say about their g o o d
intentions.
Imperial College Anti-Apartheid Group was
re-formed last Friday. O n Friday, November
20 (lunchtime today) there will be a speaker
meeting in the Union Building. Next week
there'll be a display in the Junior C o m m o n
Room for two days or more. In the near future
we'll be concerned with the unresolved issue of
S o u t h A f r i c a n g o v e r n m e n t s p o n s o r e d
students on nuclear technology courses at
Imperial College.
Astrosoc
After a brief respite last week, Astrosoc has
now bounced back with a very full programme
of events for the last few eeks of term. First
and foremost, there is the E G M on Monday,
November 23 at 5:30pm in L T 2 , when this
year's committee will be elected. Y o u still have
until Friday evening to put your name forward
as a candidate (don't forget the proposer and
two seconders as well) and even if you don't
want to be a committee member, please come
and take part in the voting.
The following day we resume our regular
lecture programme with Prof Kibble of the
T h e o r e t i c a l P h y s i c s G r o u p s p e a k i n g on
something cosmological (coffee and biscuits
afterwards). Then on the Wednesday, we have
the first of what we hope will be regular
observing meetings. This will be at 2:00pm in
the "Wave-guide" in Physics (Level 1). We
hope to start work on 6" and 8" refractors, to
enable serious observing to start before the
end of this term, and also to discuss the
subject matter of a proposed three-lecture
"course" on practical observing techniques.
S o at last A s t r o s o c has p r o v i d e d a n
alternative to lectures for those members
interested in watching the sky (or should I say
the clouds, in this climate?!), but don't let that
stop you coming to lectures as well if you want!
Ents
This is the first of a series from the new
improved Ents. In our roles of providing films,
discos and bands we're off to a cracking start
with One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest
(concluding Rag Week). As usual with our
Thursday films, it is in M e c h Eng 220 at 6:30pm
(only 50p!). Also book a date in your diary for
the Ents " A l m o s t C h r i s t m a s P a r t y " with
"Bumble and the Beez", disco and bar on
December 4 in the J C R . The week after
certain m e m b e r s of the Ents C o m m i t t e e
present "Overkill" in the Lower Refectory
(December 11), so get out your denim and
leather. Tickets for these and all other events
available from the Ents Room or from your
Hall Reprsentatives (see Hall noticeboards).
Finally, you're all welcome to attend our
Tuesday meeting at 1:00pm (Ents Room).

Doug Scott, the world famous mountaineer,
will be giving a talk, here at Imperial College,
on Saturday, November 28. The talk will be

namely one with Reinhold Messner to Makalu,
and an e x p e d i t i o n earlier in the year to
Shivling, the 'Matterhorn' of the Himalayas.
The talk will be with slides, and certainly
