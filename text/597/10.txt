Industrial
I begin this week by gnashing my teeth about
the disappearance of posters from along the
walkway; this happened between 9:30 and
12:30 of a morning which is exceeding naff. We
have heard that other societies lose theirs
more regularly—perhaps there is a Blu-Tack
fetishists around!
M o n d a y ' s t a l k w a s a n o t h e r m o n s t e r
event—many thanks to the chosen(?) few who
came along and a big W H Y N O T ? to those
who didn't.
O u r next opus is the visit to Fords at
D a g e n h a m — p c i k e t lines p e r m i t t i n g . A l l
trippers meet at Beit Arch at 12:45pm.
Finally, many thanks to our new deputy
officers who make the committee's job easier!
Wins Tsun
A d i v i s i o n of S i m o n L a u ' s M a r t i a l A r t s
Academcy of Wing Tsun Kung F u was formed
recently at Imperial College. Wing Tsun is an
art which does not emphasise a clash of force
with force, but on the clever use of one's force
so as to o v e r c o m e t h e f o r c e of o n e ' s
opponent, with fast and deadly moves.
We are having our first social event on
Saturday, December 12 at 6:30pm at IC. We
have lined up a p r o g r a m m e with variety,
consisting of a demonstration of the art by
Master L a u and students. (Master L a u is the
representative who sits on the t e c h n i c a l
committee of British Kung F u Council.) The
programme also includes a raffle, party games,
music, food and drinks.
In the meantime if you want to find out more
about the art or party, please feel free to

U n i o n G y m on W e d n e s d a y or S a t u r d a y
between 3:00 and 6:00 and 11:00 and 2:00
respectively.
Snooker
In one of the most rivetting, exciting matches
'the snooker lounge has seen for years, the C
team beat the A team. Things started well for
Tripp's boys (A team) when Calvert beat
Hurford, but when Lawrence potted every-
thing in sight to beat a stunned Thomason to
make it 1-1, it became obvious that things
weren't going the way Tripp planned. The next
match was a real nail-biter, culminating in
A n d y "It was a bit e m b a r r a s s i n g , r e a l l y "
Krussewki slamming in the pink and black
against President White who registered his
disgust by trying to make a whole in the floor
with his cue. It was now 2-1 to the C team, so it
was left ot N . Gaskill Esq. to save his side from
a fate worse than death. He was up against C
team Capt Jennings, who had just got back
from the loo in time. In a match of nervous
tension filled snoooker, Gaskill edged ahead
and when he potted the pink the immortal
words were uttered "I have won, haven't I?"
But no! H e was wrong! A miscalculation from a
maths student! A n d in a few shots time he was
heard to describe the events as "the worst day
in my life" as Jennnings potted the black to
ensure victory for his team. A n irate trip then
proceeded to crucify Paul "I think that went as
expected" Holt, to make the final score 3-2.
A m i d all this mayhem, the B team stormed
to the top of the league by taking out L S E A
team 3-2. The foundations were laid by Ward
and an excellent show of controlled aggression
by Simpkin, leaving the captain to finish it off
(just) in the final frame.

Seconds
O n Wednesday the second X V went via
L o n d o n Transport into deepest Roehampton
for a match against Roehampton Institute.
T h e team was, as always, beset by many
problems, but most of these were sorted out
in the somewhat unusual changing rooms, as
a certain second row moaned his way to
prop!
T h e game itself was dictated mainly by
Ibrward play, as the width of the pitch left a
great deal to be desired lor the backs, and
hence some heavy rucking and mauling took
place, leading to the occasional case of over
enthusiasm. The new found kicking ability of
M Winsor, aided by the less than expansive
pitch, put us 6-3 up at hall-time, i.e. two
penalties to one.
T h e game continued in much the same
vein in the second hall with much good
forward play, 'flic other points of the match
came from another penalty, and a fortunate
breakaway try from N . Brummell, which was
also converted, leaving the final score at 15-0
to Imperial.
Once again it was good to see the team

Bowling
A lull team turned up for the first match of
the season at Heathrow Bowl against Brunei
University. Bowling started at 12:00 noon
and continued throughout the afternoon
until 3:00-3:30pm. O u r A team had the
closest ol all the matches narrowly losing the
first game by H i pins, losing the second game
but winning the third, thanks mainly to the
personal effort by A n d y M c M u l l e n who
scored 200+ and good team backing from the
rest ol the A players.
B, ('. and the ladies teams were convincingly-
beaten although the B team clinched one
final game in their match. T h e overall score
was 2-14.

A long tiring journey across the border into
unchartered territory (Kent) was rewarded
with a comfortable win against Goldsmiths
III.
T h e f o u r t h s started w e l l w h e n D a v e
G l a d m a n hit a right loot shot against the
underside of the bar lor a spectacular goal.
G o l d s m i t h s e q u a l i s e d but the F o u r t h s
regained the lead when J o h n Rigby's shot
squirmed under the goalkeeper and over the
line. Rigby notched an accurately placed
second soon alter.
A counter-attack led to a line solo goal by
Dave H a r d y and the first half scoring was
completed by R i c h Dolan when his long
range drive went through a crowd ol players.
Goldsmiths restarted frantically and scored
following a corner, but the defence stood up
well to further pressure, with Dave K i n d r e d
outstanding.
Andy M c M a h o n ' s goal after a free kick
stopped any slight chance of Goldsmiths
recovery and the job was finished with a well-
taken goal by R i c h Heath.

X Country
O n Wednesday, November 11, the second
race in the University of L o n d o n League took
plact at Uxbridge. The course was over 2.3
miles of quite firm ground (except for the
occasional deep ditch and muddy puddle),
the men doing two laps and the women one.
W i t h the ladies team out in full force (all
three of us!), Sarah Pearson and C a r o l y n
Walton battled it out at the finish to come
seventeenth and eighteenth (Carolyn should
have pipped Sarah to the post, but confusion
as to where the finish actually was reversed
the result).
A few moments later Nicola Baker came
in, a good thirtieth. Tasso Asteriades came
eighth in the mens race and other creditable
performances came from Jonathan Frost,
Steve Taylor, Russel, M i k e Jones. Thanks to
everyone who turned up making a great team
spirit, and to Steve R i m m e r , who gave up his
spare time to make a guest appearance. We
all missed the presence of our captain, Pete,
however, who was having treatment on his
injured knee at the time. L e t s hope he'll be
racing again soon.
