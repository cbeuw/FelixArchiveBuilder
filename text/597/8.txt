coming into the Shop each week, I will do
a small review of some of the newer titles.
Vera Britten's War Diary 1913-1917,
Gollancz Ltd, £8.50. This will be warmly
welcomed by a whole new generation as
well as many older readers who still
treasure the memory of Testament of
Youth which we understand to again be
revived on television.
Best of J.J.-John Junior, Sidgwick and
Jackson, £6.95. This book recaptures the
anger, the compassion and the laughter of
Britain's leading columnist.
Hidden Places of B r i t a i n - L e s l i e
Thomas, Arlington Books, £9.95. A travel
book with a difference. It will appeal to all
those who love the romance of strange
places. Leslie Thomas' adventures range
from teh first street in E n g l a n d to a
lighthouse in the fare north of Shetland.
Wines of the World-Andre S i m o n ,
MacDonald, £18.95. This is the second
edition of a book by one of the greatest
authorities on wine. Serena Sutcliffe has
brought together fourteen experts in their
own areas, to provide up-to-date informa-
tion on all the wine producing regions of
the world.
David Bailey's Book of Photography,-
Dent, £14.95. The author believes that
photography is as much an art as it a
science, therefore he gives the necessary
background and technical information on
the whole of photography.
Sugar and S p i c e - R o n n i e B a r k e r ,
Hodder & Stoughton, £4.50. This is a
picture book which sings a song of praise
to the ladies: girls, women, call them what
you will. All the illustrations depict an age
gone by. A wonderful book, full of charm,
humour and sadness.
Culperers Complete Herbal, Harvey
Sale, £7.50. D o you suffer from 'chickweed
water wort', 'greater' or even 'dwarf
spruge' or maybe 'calves snout'? If you do,
you should get a copy of this marvellous

1826 edition; herbs and their uses are
presented in alphabetical order.
