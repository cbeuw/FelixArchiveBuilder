D u e to an unfortunate blockage (of the
typesetter-not constipation) you will, no doubt,
have received this issue later than normal. A t
the time of writing I'm not sure whether it'll be
iate Friday or Monday morning—I apologise
for any delay, but it is due to circumstances
beyond my control. I can assure you that my
disappointment will be greater than yours.
Royal College of Science Centenary
Oh well, I cannot remain silent. It would be a
wild exaggeration to assert that the events so
far have been a great success. Some of the
blame must be aimed at the R C S Union, who
(despite having a fortnight's worth of events
handed to them on a plate) have not generated
the necessary enthusiasm for the celebration.
But apart from this it is you, the students of
Imperial College, who are losing out. The
events have been publicised in F E L I X and with
posters—do you really need the importance of
the event rammed down your throats?
You are fortunate to be at this College whilst
R C S is in its centenary year. W e have a
chance to commemorate a hundred years of
achievement and look forward to the future.
As an institution of higher education the R C S
has a long tradition of excellence, and it is this
which should be maintained and applauded—
for it is this which has lead to the current
standards in the College and to the great
opportunities offered to the students. W e owe
a debt of gratitude to those whose hard work
has made all this possible.
To my mind it is a great pity that most of the
present student population cannot appreciate
the true significances of these celebrations. I
shall enjoy each event regardless and invite
you to join me.
Executive Names
The appeal for nicknames for the Executive
has received an overwhelming response. The
results are (in reverse order, of course):
Nick Morton: Who?, It'll be done by Xmas,
Action Man.
Barney McCabe: Grumpy, Lazy, The Goat.
Marco Ledwold: Yes Barney, Y e s Nick, Yes
Jen.
Dave Thompson: The Slob (all 52 entries).
Andy Rushton: M r Nice Guy, The Walking
Lampost.
Ross Baxter: N o entries (but he's working
on it).
Several suggestions were made as to what I
should be called—but I didn't approve of that
sort of language in print, so stop it!
Guilds Hit Squad
It has become quite apparent that the Guilds
Hit Squad is getting a bit out of hand. Raising
money by having a lot of fun is O K , but there
are limits. It's no use raising money if, in the
process, you start to become a real pain in the
arse. There's a time and place for everytntng.
Most people, including lecturers, can take a
joke, but disturbing busy people at the wrong
time and creating a lot of mess can only cause
a lot of bad feeling amongst the teaching and
technical staff.
So stop acting like a bunch of moronic thugs
and use a little bit of common sense. Keep
things to a reasonable level and you'll give
everyone a lot of laughs too.

At the start of term, I invited anyone who felt
so inclined to set a puzzle for this column. A n
American correspondent who (in a subtle
parody of my o w n nom-de-guerre) signs
himself 'Charlequin' wrote as follows:
Dear Scaramouche
I don't know if you have such things in your
country, but here one is often confronted with
multiple choice exams. Each question of these
tests has seven possible answers, labelled A - G
and one is supposed to check off the right one.
Students have since the inception of these
exams devoted much effort to finding the
"pattern" to the correct answers and recently
a friend of mine succeeded.
The test w h i c h my friend successfully
analysed was in two parts—the first consisting
of 41 questions on English history, and the
second of 101 questions on American history.
She has a good knowledge of English history
and c o u l d d e t e r m i n e , o r r e d u c e to t w o
possibilities all but three of these questions as
follows:
1. C 15. B 29. E
2. C 16. C 30. A or F
3. D 17. G 31. A or E
4. B 18. B or G 32. B or D
5. A or C 19. G 33. C
6. D 20. unknown 34. E
7. E or G 21. B or F 35. F
8. E 22. E 36. G
9. F or G 23. unknown 37. A
10. A or E 24. C or F 38. F
11. D 25. D or F 39. A or E
12. A or C 26. unknown 40. D
13. D 27. E 41. A or C
14. C 28. D
She was able to determine the first three
answers of the second part to be G , E, and C .
Then she recognized the pattern, and quickly
filled in the remaining answers.
What is the pattern?
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me at the
FELIX Office, please. £5 (donated by Mend-a-
Bike) and two tickets to IC Orchestra's
concert next Wednesday for the correct
solution drawn on Wednesday at 1:00pm.
Last Week's Solution
Fumble and Grumble.
Stripped of its verbal trappings, the problem
entails adding one line to the diagram so that all
seventeen lines will form one continuous chain
starting at C and ending at a point adjacent to
C.
A, C , F, & G all have an odd number of lines
leading from them, so the chain starts at C ,
ends at A , and F & G must be linked.
John Bottom, C i v Eng 1, can collect his
cheque on Monday afternoon.
Many thanks to IC Orchestra for the extra
prize this week. The tickets will be in the
winner's pigeonhole by 1:30pm on Wednes
day.
