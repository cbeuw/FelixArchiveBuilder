In praise of Hobgoblin, the Swiss Army beer
Henry Eshbaugh, Music Editor and serial album enthusiast, reveals his true passion –
Hobgoblin beer.
COMMENT

I
t’s just gone 11 AM,
your head is fuzzy,
and you roll onto
your side to find a
half-finished can of Stella.
Your body screams for hy-
dration but your head rails
against the prospect of
drinking lukewarm piss,
flat, tasteless, and sticky.
Oh, fates! Defeated, you
slump back into bed,
clutching your pounding
head and cursing the deci-
sions that led you to this
moment.
My friends, I have,
after substantial research,
found what I believe to
be the ultimate sesh fuel.
Hobgoblin, a product of
Witchwood Brewery, is
a ruby ale which tastes
nice, can be downed with
minimal effort towards
the end of pres, and, most
importantly, is 5.2%. A
500mL (2.6 units) bottle
goes for 1.39 in the local
Tezzers.
There are some very
important consequences
of this. Namely, this beats
the 3-for-5 deal: 3 for
4.20 (ain’t that a beautiful
coincidence?), serving up
7.3 units of wonderful,
wonderful ale. Few other
“nice” beers compete; the
popular Doom Bar is only
4.3%, and usually costs
in the range of 1.80 to 2
quid per 500mL, and so is
much less efficient when
you’re trying to get out the
door to Egg (house music
deeper than the scarring in
my liver).
Oh, but you observe,
you could just stick with
trusty ol’ 1664 or Stella,
or, god forbid, Fosters.
They might not have the
percentage, but they do
have the volume - you can
grab a pack of 4 tallbois
for a similar price. But
that’s only 8 units, so
for the cost of drinking
something less enjoyable,
you’ve only gained a
margin of 0.7 units. Was it
worth it?
And this leads me to my
last and most important
point - drinkability under
varying circumstances.
You’re heading out to the
sesh, so you dunk your
cans in your bag and set
out on your merry way.
But unless it’s the dead
of winter, those cans are
gonna start to warm up.
A lager that ain’t cold is a
lager that ain’t enjoyable.
Better get the road bevs in
before they go lukewarm,
and better hope that the
sesh on the other end of
the journey has a fridge
with enough room for
your brews.
Cue the hobbo gobbo,
a beer which maintains its
drinkability and taste over
a wide range of tempera-
tures and varying degrees
of flatness. Your worries
about beer temperature
essentially evaporate. I
mean, sure, it’s still pref-
erable to imbibe chilled
(quoth Strong Bad: “a one
that is not cold is scarcely
a one at all”). But the
implication of the act of
imbibing warm entering
the realm of possibility
has profound consequenc-
es.
To come full circle: it’s
just gone 11 AM, your
head is fuzzy, and you
roll onto your side to a
half-finished bottle of
Hobgoblin. Oh, merciful
gods, yes!
Weddings are shit and the Royals are lizards
Turns out Grumpy Bastard hates weddings and the royals. What joy.
W
hen I heard
about the
e n g a g e -
ment of
Miss Megahn Markle
to Prince Harry, I was
non-plussed. I have zero
interest in other people’s
happiness so I only noted
the annoying way she
spelt Megan. Extra letters
are a classically preten-
tious way of trying to
make something normal
special. As a reminder to
everyone out there that
harbours these delusions,
we all die, and eventually

the universe will end. No
one cares.
My main source of
annoynance about this
particular topic is the
amount I’m forced to see.
Normally, I can ignore
the Royals by not reading
tabloid newspapers. Don’t
get me wrong, I appreciate
the fear and ignorance that
flood from the gates of
Murdoch’s media empire,
but unfortunately, they
cost money to read and are
slightly less economical
than actual toilet paper.
I’m confident that there
will now be daily updates
as the national psyche
gears up for the orgy of
coverage of the actual
event. If it was a funeral
I might be interested, as I
feed on misery, but if the
media essentially expects
me to be estatic about
some healthy, happy
and very wealthy people
becoming even happier,
they can fuck right off.
Weddings are shit.
I’m fairly certain they
are religion’s version of
chicken, where couples,
bound by the chains of
marriage wait for their
counterpart to admit that
the relationship has failed
and they hate them before
an acrimonious divorce.
The best man’s speech
is always terrible, either
attempting to be funny at
the groom’s expense and
failing, or accidentally
revealing the STI-ridden
sex the groom had with the
stag-night stripper. The
amount of money spent on
idiotic clichés by gullible
couples so that they can
remember this day for the
rest of their lives, if only
as the event that burnt a
hole in their bank account
and destroyed their
economic future. Half of
the guests don’t want to
be there and resent the
wedding because x or y
could do so much better.
Admittedly in this case, it
is hard to see how either
side could do better. One
is a successful actress and
UN goodwill ambassador,
and the other has dressed
up as a Nazi and showed
his genitals to Las Vegas.
My hatred of this par-
ticular wedding is deeply
rooted in the fact that
Royals are involved. They
are by far the most entitled
and useless bastards in the
world with a poor history
of weddings.
I’m unsure how long
Diana lasted before Philip
gave the order to closely
acquaint her with a dash-
board, but I have already
planned my response to
the divorce/assassination
of Meghan in around
20 years. Given Philip’s
advanced age he probably
won’t have to a second
time. Then again, it is
well known that lizards
can enter a trancelike state
for hundreds of years, so
he may be communicating
telepathically with MI5
for centuries to come.
Something that
garnered a significant
amount of coverage from
all this shitstorm is the
race of Meghan Markle.
Quite frankly, the race of
Harry’s betrothed doesn’t
matter: all that matters is
that the Queen’s current
host is getting on a bit and
they’re all out of skins.
Most of all, my focused
hatred is directed towards
those students that set up
bachelor and bachelorette
parties for the bride
and groom. Fuck your
pathetic attempt at the
popularity contest that is
social media and fuck the
society that encourages
you. BBC news is truly
for the weak minded.
