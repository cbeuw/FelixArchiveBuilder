Felix
Brompton Hospital to continue heart surgery
services after NHS U-turn

has reversed
plans to close
three of the
country’s heart surgery
units, including that of
the Royal Brompton
Hospital.
Proposals published by
NHS England in July 2016
relating to future commis-
sioning of congenital heart
disease (CHD) services
for adults and children
had earmarked a number
of units for closure.
Earlier this week,
however, the NHS
England board announced
that units at the Royal
Brompton, Leicester, and
Newcastle would remain
open, subject to certain
conditions, a move wel-
comed by a number of Im-
perial staff and students.
The proposals, which
stated that centres
wishing to carry out CHD
treatment would need a
number of other services
on-site, generated a large
amount of controversy.
Lord Darzi, holder of
and Sir Magdi Yacoub,
Professor of Cardiotho-
racic Surgery at Imperial’s
National Heart and Lung
Institute, said closure
would be “a disaster” and
“not in the best interest of
our patients”.
Royal Brompton and
Harefield NHS Founda-
tion Trust currently do
not provide all services
required by the proposals
on-site; instead, they work
in collaboration with
Chelsea and Westminster
Hospital, which is located
less than a mile away. The
proposals also stated that
centres would need three
heart surgeons, carrying
out 125 operations each
year.
The Royal Brompton
and Harefield NHS
Foundation Trust have
outlined a new proposal
for meeting the standards,
joining with King’s Health
Partners, which comprises
of a number of hospitals in
south London. They plan
to develop a purpose-built
facility, as well as increase
investment at other sites.
They will continue to
offer CHD services as
they work towards these
new plans. NHS England
has said that keeping the
service open is “condi-
tional on demonstrating
convincing progress along
the way”. Newcastle
