Mudbound – A sweeping epic that plays out like an
intricate character study
By juxtaposing white and black families on a single piece of farmland, Dee Rees confronts the brutal realities of
prejudice and privilege in the divided Jim Crow South.
L
ook out at the
world and you’ll
notice all the
things that set
you apart from everyone
else; the characteristics
that make you – and every-
one else – unique and
different. Mudbound
however, is a reminder
of what we all share – the
human struggle to take
control of our lives and
make something out of
our brief existence on this
earth. Mudbound lets this
struggle play out against
a backdrop of rural 1940s
Mississippi. Two families,
one black and one white,
occupy the same piece of
farmland, but in vastly
different capacities. The
white family, led by the
gruff, straight-talking
Henry McAllan (Jason
Clarke) are the benefi-
ciaries of racial privilege
in the Jim Crow South
and the owners of the
farm. The black family,
headed by a guarded
and long-suffering Hap
Jackson (Rob Morgan)
are tenant farmers who,
for decades, have been
bound to this land. The
Jacksons have worked
this land for generations,
first as slaves in the an-
tebellum South and later
as sharecroppers, subser-
vient to whichever white
landlord held ownership
over this modest patch of
mud-soaked farmland in
the Mississippi Delta.
In Mudbound, while
no two scenes are the
same, the one constant
throughout the film is the
presence of mud. That
grimy, sticky substance
that purges purity with
pollution and turns fertile
ground into a barren
wasteland from which
nothing good can grow.
Here, land is a symbol of
relentless hardship and
inescapable struggle. It
is a burden, always on
the verge of becoming
waterlogged and taking
its servants down with it.
Hap works the land not
because he wants to, but
because he dreams of one

day being able to afford a
patch of land that he can
call his own. He works
the land day and night,
breaking it and sowing it;
hoeing it and caring for
it; tossing the soil till his
palms swell; and plough-
ing the earth till his back
breaks. His only reprieve
comes in the form of his
weekly Sunday church
service where he can
maintain the hope that one
day, he and his family may
break free of this timeless
struggle. As he preaches
to the other sharecroppers
on the farm, Hap lifts a
sermon into a hymn and
delivers the message that
“one morning, we gon’
break this boot from
‘round our neck and shake
these chains from ‘rounds
our feets”. The central
question of Mudbound is
whether that dream can
become a reality.
On the other side of
the farm, Henry; his wife
Laura (Carey Mulligan);
and Henry’s father, Pappy
(Jonathan Banks) live in
a derelict cabin without
any electricity or running
water. Laura, tenderly por-
trayed by Ms. Mulligan, is
introduced as an unhappy
31 year-old woman, still
living with her parents,
who quickly agrees to
marry the plain-speaking
and uncomplicated Henry
on the insistence of her
mother. The social climate
of the era demands that
Laura remain subservient
to her husband, and
indeed she does so, gladly,
until she meets Henry’s
younger brother, Jamie
(Garrett Hedlund). Jaime
is undoubtedly the most
charismatic character of
the film’s ensemble, and
his magnetic personality
and relaxed confidence
do more to evoke the
image of James Bond than
that of a grounded 20th
century farmhand. It’s not
long before Laura falls for
Jamie, but their simmering
romance is quickly put to
an end when Jamie ships
off to the military, bound
for Europe and the war.
Over at the Jacksons’,
Hap’s eldest son, Ronsel
(Jason Mitchell), mirrors
Jamie’s choice and also
heads off to the war.
The choice to juxtapose
the experiences of black
and white Americans,
both abroad on the
battlefields of Europe
and at home in heart
of Mississippi, allows
Mudbound to explore the
segregationist politics
of the Jim Crow era in a
way few other films have
managed. In Europe,
Ronsel and his all-black
761st Tank Battalion
are viewed as liberators.
Whenever they roll into
a beleaguered village or a
besieged town, the locals
greet them with raptur-
ous applause and tears
of joy. Racial prejudice
and injustice are notice-
ably absent, and all that
remains is the immense
expression of gratitude
from one community of
people to another.
Back in Mississippi
however, Ronsel is
reminded of his sec-
ond-class status within
American society. Every
time he wants to use the
washroom or ride the bus,
signboards with the word
“coloured” remind him of
the institutionally-man-
dated divide between
blacks and whites in the
country he calls home.

and women to toil day
and night on that mud-
swamped farmland.
During one of these
monologues, Florence
Jackson (Mary J. Blige),
Ronsel’s mother, intones
that her son “can’t sit
still, can’t move”. He is
trapped in between two
worlds: the blood-soaked
battlefields where he was
praised as a saviour and
the mud-soaked farmland
where he must stay and
work, out of a sense of
duty to his family. The
only other person who
truly understands this
inner battle is Jamie,
and over the latter half
of the film, the two end
up finding some sense of
comfort in sharing their
wartime experiences with
one another.
A veteran fighter pilot,
Jamie is haunted by a
particularly harrowing
wartime experience
that has left him with a
damaging case of PTSD.
Whiskey is his medicine
and Ronsel is his partner
in crime. Barely a scene
goes by where Jamie is
not halfway through a
bottle of alcohol, but even
despite his seemingly
carefree attitude, he never
forgets that his friendship
with Ronsel rests on
shaky ground. The Ku
Klux Klan was well and
alive in 1940s Mississippi
and were intent on ad-
vancing their supremacist
ideology by using any
means necessary.
Mudbound is a film
that manages to be both
intimate and expansive. A
story that orbits around the
Mississippi Delta, but also
drifts into the far reaches
of Western Europe. Even
though the lives of the
two families play out on
a single stage of mud-
swamped farmland, they
overlap in more ways than
one. Whereas the older
folks are eager to preserve
the culture of casual
prejudice and inherited
privilege, the younger
ones are desperate to
intersect along the lines
of a rapidly changing
social climate, and in
doing so, she crafts a bold
and intimate work that
resonates well beyond its
historical period.
Mudbound is a piece
of poetry that explores
the contours of racial
privilege and prejudice
in a delicate and nuanced
manner. It is a film of
tender introspection
amplified with occasional
moments of action. The
film is told from the per-
spective of six characters,
and come Oscar season,
it will be someone’s job
to separate the lead ones
from the supporting ones.
For now, it is safe to say
that with Mudbound,
Rees has taken the most
mundane of circumstanc-
es, and crafted a sweeping
epic that plays out like an
intricate character study.
That alone is enough to
warrant your respect.
Mudbound is currently
on Netflix and is available
at Curzon cinemas.

The naked reality of such
racial prejudice is perfect-
ly captured when Ronsel,
having just returned home
from the war, casually
attempts to leave a
shopping store through
the front door. He doesn’t
get far before Pappy, the
McAllan family’s other
patriarch, sternly reminds
him that “you’re in Mis-
sissippi now ni**er, you
use the back door.”
Mudbound is adapted
from Hillary Jordan’s
novel of the same name,
and at several moments
throughout the film, Dee
Rees substitutes dialogue
for inner monologues
drawn directly from
Jordan’s source material.
