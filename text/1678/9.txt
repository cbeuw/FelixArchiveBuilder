Favourite Worst
Nightmareisarecollection
of a night out, a sly dig
at the trappings of fame,
and a teary confession
of naïve love that wasn’t
meant to be. Forming the
second album of their
discography, FWN defines
a tension in growing up,
an age without the sere-
nading eloquence of Suck
it and See or the matured
confidence of AM, but one
so keenly aware of the
‘joie de vivre’ in the sim-
plicity and carefreeness
encapsulated in Whatever
People say I am. (The
introspective Humbug
defies any attempt at
labelling it).
Kick-starting the album
with the breathless track
‘Brianstorm’, frontman
and lyricist Alex Turner
launches into a running
narrative of an individ-
ual who might as well
be called Zarathustra.
“Brian” seems to break
the proverbial mould, as
he leaves “hundreds of
blokes” weeping, after
their ladies tell him to
“use me”. Indeed, as
anyone who had to spend
time around the Beit Quad
soon finds, an undercur-
rent of despairing lust
runs beneath the deceptive
surface. In ‘D is for Dan-
gerous’, Turner observes,
with equal parts disgust
and schadenfreude, how
the lads talk their partner
into taking the ‘D’ whilst
“trying to keep their
trousers on”.
The ladies, for their
part, are not as innocent as
they look, as they ‘“take
off their wedding ring”,
and whisper “it’s red wine
this time” to their man for
the night. In the frenzy
of disguised gentility
and feigned innocence,
Alex Turner imploringly
cries that you won’t find
fulfilment in these des-
perate quarters, just as a
detective won’t find his
suspect “in a pair of dead
man’s eyes”. Between the
unflinching lyricism and
Matt Helders’ impecca-
ble drumming, listeners
would find that Favourite
Worst Nightmare is not
so much a glorification
of any paint-by-number
kit for love, as it is itself
a search for the ineffable,
lost and heartfelt. From
the teary plead in ‘Do Me
A Favour’ where Turner
asks for no-pulled-punch-
es in the demise of a rela-
tionship, (“Perhaps fuck
off might be too kind”),
to the snarl at gossipers to
leave his past lover alone
in ‘If You Were There,
Beware’, the album closes
on ‘505’, the emotional
depth of which most as-
suredly propels the band
into Rock History. Backed
up by an atmospheric
organ, Turner paints a
portrait of a girl waiting
for her weary traveller
behind door “505”, calm
and knowing with “her
hands between her
thighs”. Another gem is
‘Only Ones Who Know’,
a naked confession and
lonely testament to the
existence of Capital-t
True love, its voice cold
and broken like Leonard
Cohen’s ‘Hallelujah’,
its crescendo sure and
unerring as King Solo-
mon’s ‘Song of Songs’.
Fiercely subversive and
breathlessly frenetic, Fa-
vourite Worst Nightmare
is an impassioned take on
growing up, losing a fight,
as we all do, in capturing
the present against the
uncompromising passage
of time, where we trade
“all the naughty nights’”
for ‘niceness’. Or, in the
words of a certain poet, to
“play it fucking loud” one
last time.

N
ow That’s
What I Call
Music! is a
c r o s s - l a b e l
series of compilation
albums of the biggest
songs of the year (or, at
least, whatever they could
get the rights to). Now,
historically, I haven’t
really been their biggest
fan, but I found Now
That’s What I Call Music!
98 to be one of the most
moving listens I have
ever had the pleasure of
experiencing.
So what sets 98 apart
from all the rest? Well,
someone over there in
the faceless marketing
department that puts these
together has clearly just
lost the ability to care.
And if watching Kurt
Cobain interviews has
taught me anything, it’s
that not caring is totally
cool, man! I mean, listen
to the opening bars on
the second track, Post
Malone’s ‘rockstar’ (sic):
“I be fuckin hoes and
poppin’ pillies / man I
feel just like a rockstar,”
and switches straight
into the weed references
and making an Uzi go
“ratatata”. Fantastic stuff.
Can you picture a bunch
of old white dudes in suits
sitting around a table at
a meeting, intently and
blank-facedly listening to
trap talking about racking
up lines of cocaine at a
house party? Talk about
fishes out of water. Their
marriages are failing and
they really just don’t give
a shit what’s on the album,
do they? Only as long as
it sells. How much more
nihilistic-punk-rock can
you get?
Or how about “Reg-
gaeton Lento”, CNCO’s
contribution? Mmm, that
autotuned crowd-vocal
chorus just makes me want
to sing along like the tone-
deaf husk of a consumer
I am. Like, I think it’s
trying to sound generic
and played-out, but that
just makes it more endear-
ing, you know? Because
I for one love flashbacks
to middle school dances.
Or how about the verse -
“You make me sick / you
make me sick / you’re my
doctor” is brilliant - on
first listen you’d think it’s
just a cheesy attempt at
a flamenco-inspired pop
song, but then you realize
they’re dropping knowl-
edge about the dangers of
hospital-borne infections!

critics of the series will
be quick to dismiss 98 as
being “just like the rest,”

You don’t walk into an
album like this with any

With a new album rumoured for 2018, Felix revisits the decade-old Favourite Worst Nightmare.

The most disappointing albums of 2017
Everything Now
Arcade Fire
Four years of relative
silence followed the
transcendental double
LP Reflektor. Produced
by LCD Soundsystem’s
James Murphy, the album
represented a departure
and seemingly sought to
put even more distance
between them and their
Funeral days. The lead
single and titular track
set the tone for the rest of
the album; it was very…
ABBA. Now don’t get me
wrong, I like ‘Dancing
Queen’ as much as the
next guy, but behind the
frolicking piano riffs and
kaleidoscopic harmonies
there’s a distinct lack of
the oomph and introspec-
tive vigour that they’re
known and loved for.

credit, the hype generated
in advance of the release
was immense. Posters

ically rendered in three

considerable following,
their sophomore effort,
2014’s This is All Yours
fell reasonably flat on its
face. Sadly, the same was
true (∆) of their latest
outing. RELAXER starts
strongly; brooding opener
‘3WW’ is comparable to
‘Intro’, and lead single ‘In
Cold Blood’ has the hi-fi
auditory muscle of their
early work, albeit more
radio friendly. However,
it’s not to last. The second

the break there’s a dreary
cover of ‘House of the

co’s latest foray, Another
Bloody One, sorry, This
Old Dog, shows us Mac
at his best. And worst.
And all levels in between.
(They’re all the same).
Remarkably consistent,
he’s certainly found his
winning formula, one that
he is clearly content to
rehash again and again.
And why wouldn’t he
be? Pitchfork lap it up,
and not really caring what
people think is his whole
thing. Maybe I’m too
harsh. I will admit, this
record gives us glimpses
of a new Mac, one that
is wistful and reflective.
And the soundscapes in
‘Moonlight on the River’
are sublime. But still, I
can’t help but want for
something more.

T
hese people
want you to be
calm, but I don’t
want you to be
calm – I want you to take
your fucking trousers off”
lead singer Josh Homme’s
Californian drawl crooned
to the 20,000 strong
crowd at the O2 Arena
last Tuesday. Queens of
the Stone Age, the leg-
endary heavy rock band,
embarked on the UK leg
of their Villians world-
wide tour this month, with
two nights in London last
week. Some recent hits
started the show off, with
the 5-piece band strutting
about between wobbly
light sticks that littered
the stage. However, the
band felt uneasy when
they moved onto their
newest songs, including
‘The Way We Used To
Do’, the first single off the
Mark Ronson-produced
album, released in August
of this year. The bluesy
performance didn’t seem
to resonate with QOTSA’s
diehard audience. This
was short lived though.
The band hit back with
two classics off their
acclaimed 2002 album
Songs for the Dead; per-
haps their most famous
song, ‘No One Knows’,
got the crowd going again
(although no trousers
were removed). This also
marked the first of drum-
mer Jon Theodore’s solos,
with the new drummer
proving his worth whilst
Homme had a cigarette
break on stage. By now
the show had warmed
up, and the second single
from Villians was well
received. This hype
continuedthroughthenau-
tical themed tracks from
2013’s ...Like Clockwork
and into the Villians’ track
‘Domesticated Animals’.
Pink lighting bathed the
stage as Homme swooned
his way through the
closest thing QOTSA has
to a love song, ‘Make It
Wit Chu’, which brought
a close knit comforting
atmosphere to the cav-
ernous O2 arena. This
juxtaposed the eerie and
wistful ‘I Appear Missing’
and ‘Villains of Circum-
stances’, performed in a
near operatic manner with
soft blue lighting centring
in on Homme as the songs
drew out. The audience
was lulled with this sense
of finality, but luckily, the
end was not yet in sight.
Snapping back into
some QOTSA classics,
they finished the show
with ‘A Song for the
Dead’. This melodic track
showcased the renowned
skills of all five band
members, whilst they
kicked the wobbly lights
left, right and centre. The
O2 arena was left reeling,
but with trousers still
intact.
