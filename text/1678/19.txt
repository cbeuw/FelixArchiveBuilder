Extra security hired for Business School following
break-in

managed to tailgate

School cafe, upsetting
the MBA students
gathered there.

E
xtra security
has had to be
installed in
the Business
School, after several
chemistry undergradu-
ates were caught sneak-
ing into their cafe.
The incident occurred
earlier this week. A
group of second year
students, believed to be
taking a break from their
fluorescence spectroscopy
lab, tailgated through
the doors to the Business
School, and entered the
by wearing badly-tailored
suits from Reiss.
One student who
spoke to Felix said that
the experience had left
them uneasy to go into
the Business School Cafe
again: “I was using my
personal study table,
trying to revise the “5 S’s
of Good Business” – sell,
steal, schmooze, snake,
sociopathy – when I heard
these two guys talking
about organic chemistry
in voices slightly above
room level. Of course,
it was very intimidating
– they then invaded my
study bubble to ask to
borrow some chairs, so
I maced them and called
security.”
Another MBA student
told Felix “my parents
didn’t donate vast sums
of money to Imperial so I
could rub shoulders with
undergraduates. They did
it so I could learn about
business psychology
and do a subject where
Freakonomics is consid-
ered course material.”
Vice Provost (Java
Supplies), Mike Titch-
ford, told Felix that he
“understood the con-
cerns” surrounding use
of the Business School
cafe: “many students and
staff feel that the products
served in the Business
School cafe are of a
higher quality, and they
are. But we are confident
that, thanks to the invis-
ible hand of the market,
the full-bodied arabica
will eventually trickle
down to all students on
campus. Even those in the
materials department.”
Campus services have
now intervened to ensure
that security is tightened

School and the RSM has
now been bricked up, and
all visitors must present
identity cards at the
School’s entrance. Before
entry, students will have
to answer a series of ques-
tions, including “what
is your CID number?”,
“what year are you sched-
uled to graduate?”, and
“what well-used service
to society would you most
like to disrupt with a start-
up that nobody asked for
or needs?”
Students affected have
already been provided
about the counseling and
support services available
on campus. They have
also been provided with
a map to said services,
since the majority have
only know how to get to
that weird silver cylinder.

Monarchists are torn
between their love
of the Royal Family
and their suspicion of
those with darker skin.
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
T
he announce-
ment of the
engagement of
Prince Harry
and Meghan Markle
has seen the country
erupt in a celebration of
monarchy, tradition, and
casual racism.
The Prince, a former
serviceman who is now
out of work, but performs
occasional charity work,
is set to marry Markle in
a ceremony in May 2018.
Markle, a successful
actor, is also noted for her
charity work, privileged
upbringing, and posses-
sion of melanin.
The announcement re-
ceived widespread notice
in the mainstream media,
particularly in the tabloid
press. The Daily Mail had
the newsroom equivalent
of a stroke, as editors were
caught between their love
for anything Royal-relat-
ed and their disdain for
anything they consider
foreign.
Some of the responses
to the announcement
have been accused of
“dog-whistle racism”, a
label some contest. One
student Felix spoke to said
“I’m not at all racist, but
there’s just something I
don’t like about Meghan.
I can’t put my finger
on it, but she doesn’t
seem to quite fit into
the Royal Family. I love
Kate though, she’s such a
classic British beauty.”
Thomas Rhidian, the
Union’s Ethical Adju-
dicator, expressed his
disappointment in the
reaction: “I had hoped
that a progressive, for-
ward-thinking institution
like the monarchy would
have more open-minded
fans. It’s surprising that
people who care deeply
about the difference
between the Union flag
and the Union Jack, and
don’t seem freaked out
about Prince George being
dressed like a child who
died in 1934 would hold
such backward views.”
But this didn’t dampen
the mood for some mon-
archists. Felix headed
down to Buckingham
Palace, where a crowd of
royalists were gathered
waving, bunting, and
being generally off-put-
ting. One person said “it’s
times like this that really
unite the country. We can
all get together in cele-
bration of a single cause:
single-mindedly referring
to women with dark skin
as ‘exotic’.”

Royal engagement shows we’re still really racist
This week you have a
lecture on penguins. You
decide to take inspiration
from their strategies of
huddling for warmth this
winter – to ACC it is.
This week you get super
excited about the royal
wedding, but then you
realise you’re not going
to get a bank holiday.
You’re a republican now.
This week, following
safety incidents in your
lab, you get a lecture on
the dangers of exposure
to ICL. You’ve been here
for two years, you know
Imperial’s bad for your
health.
This week you’re
disappointed by the lack
of Christmas-themed
offerings in the Library
Cafe, but then you
realise: nothing can make
a 8pm jacket potato in
preparation for an all-
nighter ‘festive’.
This week it’s the end
of Movember. You’re
relieved to get to shave
your moustache off
before you’re put on a
watchlist.
This week you’re
really happy about how
well physics did in the
league tables, then you
remember you’re doing
physics, and you’re sad
again.
This week your popular
meme page makes it to
BBC News. You still
haven’t got a blue tick on
Twitter though...
This week, in your
support of a hard Brexit,
you decide to go against
the EU wonks and
their health and safety
regulations. Your building
has its labs shut down.
Nice one.
This week you’re a Felix
reader, and you’re pretty
sick of all the stories
about league tables. Trust
me, we’re bored too.
This week, the fact you’re
reading this means you’re
one week closer to the
end of term, and sweet
release from Imperial. Go
you.
This week you work
in the Union Offices,
and you’re dreading the
imminent introduction
of mandatory non-
denominational holiday
jumpers.
