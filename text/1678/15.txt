Asian invasion: Felix Food takes on dumplings
DUMPLINGS
You will need...
• 500g minced pork
• 2 stalks of spring
onion
• 5 cloves of garlic
• 1 whole yellow
onion
• 1 whole carrot
• 3 spoons of light
soy sauce
• 2 spoons of oyster
sauce
• 5 fresh shiitake
mushrooms (op-
tional)
• Salt and white pep-
per to taste
• Wonton skins
(make them on
your own or buy
them from an Asian
grocery store)
1. Chop the carrot, garlic, yellow onion,
shiitake mushrooms, and green onion as
finely as possible. A food processor can be
used to save time.
2. Mix the chopped ingredients, along
with the light soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt
and white pepper, with the minced pork in
a mixing bowl.
3. Form a meatball the size of a 1p coin
and place it on the wonton skin. Wet your
fingers with some cold water to help seal
the wonton skin during the folding pro-
cess. Ensure that the skin is not torn while
folding. There are several ways to fold the
wonton skin which are:
• Fold one corner to another corner of the
wonton skin diagonally to form a triangu-
lar shaped wonton dumpling.
• Fold one corner to another diagonal corner,
then pull the bottom corners towards each
other and away from the first vertex to form
a Chinese gold ingot shaped dumpling.
• Pinch all four corners together to the mid-
dle to form a pouch shaped dumpling.
4. The dumplings can be either deep-fried
with vegetable oil until the skin is gold-
en brown, boiled into a soup for about 6
minutes, or steamed for about 15 minutes.
Serve with sweet chilli dipping sauce.

simple and quick

great! Hopefully they’ve

don’t you occasionally
imagine yourself cooking
a Michelin-starred dish,
unleashing your inner

millions as a celebrity
chef? Great dreams...

break in the very near

for recipes more complex
than instant noodles or

Wonton or dumplings,
whatever you call it, you
can’t deny that, with its
succulent skin, this juicy,
savoury ball of happiness
is the ultimate comfort
food. Traditionally,
dumplings are eaten when

CHINESE FRIED
RICE
You will need...
• 3 cups of cooked
long grain rice (use
overnight rice for
better texture)
• 2 eggs
• 2 tablespoons of
light soy sauce
• 1 tablespoon of
oyster sauce
• Vegetable cooking
oil
• Salt and pepper to
taste
• 1 can of spam (can
be substituted with
100g of chicken
meat or pancetta)
• 1 cup of mixed
frozen vegetables
(carrots, peas and
corn)
1. Whisk the eggs in the bowl with a bit of salt.
Heat the pan on a medium-high heat and add a
tablespoon of oil.
2. Fry the eggs and break them apart while cook-
ing as if you are making scrambled eggs. Remove
the cooked eggs from the pan and set aside for
now.
3. Wipe the pan clean with a kitchen towel and 2
tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat.
4. Add in the spam (or meat of choice) and stir-
fry for about 2-3 minutes. Add in the mixed vege-
tables and stir fry for another minute.
5. Add in the cooked rice into the pan along with
the light soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt, and pepper.
Stir fry for another 3-5 minutes and ensure that
the rice is evenly coated with the sauce.
6. Add in the scrambled eggs from earlier and
mix them well. Serve hot.

gathers round a table and
chats away. Maybe that’s
why dumplings always
give those growing up in
these cultures a sense of
home and reunion.
London has some great
dumpling places, but most
of the time they can burn a
hole through your wallet.
If, after 50 dumplings, you’re still not full,
then here’s another recipe for you. Scrap those
visits to fancy, potential-to-cripple-you-finan-
cially Chinese restaurants.
This recipe is terribly tedious, I know, but I also
believe that the satisfaction you feel gobbling up
those babies will outweigh the trouble. Get your
friends and family to make it together and it’ll be a
great bonding session.
Why not make it yourself
then? 50-60 dumplings for
less than £10 sounds like
an awesome deal for me.
So there you go, impress
your friends and family
with your hidden cooking
talent.

Worth the Hype? Shake Shack
Another American food giant trying to take over the UK? Well this time it better be good! Felix is sending its best
critique to see whether it’s really worth it.

W
hen you
think of
the United
S t a t e s
of America what do
you imagine? Towering
skyscrapers? Sunny
Beaches? Famous faces?
How about a good ol’
American cheeseburger?
The burger is an iconic
American food, even
recently honoured in
the movie The Founder
telling the story of how
McDonald’s came to be.
But don’t worry, I won’t
be reviewing McDonald’s
today (that hype is way
out of my league), instead
I’ll be taking a look at a
more recent import: Shake
Shack.
In the US, where the
burger reigns supreme,
creating a new burger
brand which captures the
public’s attention is no
easy feat. However that
is exactly what Shake
Shack has done. Since
its founding in 2004 it
has been one of the fast-
est-growing food chains,
amassing 136 locations as
of October 2017. Shake
Shack has all the makings
of a classic fast food
outlet: a relatively simple
menu, including the es-
sential burgers and fries,
and food served excep-
tionally quickly. However
in comparison to the
more long-standing fast
food chains, Shake Shack
delivers up a quality meal,
with fresher ingredients
from “like-minded arti-
sanal producers” (yes this
is actually a quote from
their website).
In 2013 Shake Shack
opened its first London
location in Covent
Garden, and has main-
tained a steady hype
around its brand, allowing
for a further three loca-
tions to open in the city
and four more in the UK.
As the favourite burger of
the east coast of the US I
began to wonder: is Shake
Shack really worth the
hype?
First impressions
To get the most authen-
tic experience I visited
the original London
location: Covent Garden.
Covent Garden itself has
a palpable buzz, off which
Shake Shack was cleverly
feeding. The main seating
area is centred in the
middle of the vibrant
market building piazza
while the food is ordered
and prepared inside
the building opposite.
The ordering room was
smartly decorated with
a simple colour scheme,
including dark blues and
the bright dark green of
the Shake Shack logo.
The menu itself was
quite straightforward
and focused on burgers
and hot dogs. To get the
full experience I ordered
a selection, including a
“In the US,
where the
burger reigns
supreme,
creating a new
burger brand
which captures
the public’s
attention is no
easy feat”
“The taste
was a mix of
the squidgy
slightly sweet
bun, the melty
cheesy and
the thin meaty
patty”
ShackBurger, the famous
‘Shroom Burger’ (raved
about by all the vegetar-
ians I know), and crin-
kle-cut fries. After placing
our order we were given
a little buzzer – I imagine
this was to build the antic-
ipation for our food. To be
fair it did work: when the
buzzer rang a few minutes
later I practically leapt up
from my chair and rushed
to the food widow where
I was given a sturdy
steel tray laden with the
steaming vibrant food.
The smell of the fries and
burgers had me practical-
ly drooling but the key
question remained: how
would it taste?
The food
I decided to start with
the classic ShackBurger: a
cheeseburger with lettuce,
tomato, and ShackSauce.
Taking my first bite, I
was not disappointed.
The taste was a mix of
the squidgy slightly sweet
bun, the melty cheesy,
and the thin meaty patty.
It certainly tasted like a
burger, but was a huge step
up from the classic fast-
food chains. The burger
patty actually tasted of
proper meat and had a
slightly crunchy outside,
with a nice texture which
balanced the super soft
bun. However, before I
felt I had even started I
had finished. The burger
is quite small, especially
compared to other burger
restaurants which have
much larger meat patties
making the burgers feel
like a proper meal. But
not to worry – I had plenty
more to get through.
As a ‘palate cleanser’
I decided to go for the
crinkle-cut fries. The
crinkle-cut is certainly
a novelty, and gives the
fries an extra crispy coat.
They were exceptionally
good, perfectly crisp and
soft in the middle, with
the right balance of salt.
Now for the ‘Shroom
Burger.’ This was
probably the one item I
was most excited for, as
I had never seen a veg-
etarian burger like this.
The burger is made from
a portobello mushroom
stuffed with oozing melty
cheese and fried. My god
did it look good. My first
bite transported me to
a food paradise: the hot
cheesy middle rushed into
my mouth mixing with
the juicy mushroom and
its crispy coating. If this
is what the vegetarian
revolution is bringing,
then sign me up.

Worth the Hype?
Shake Shack has
been raved about in the
US, and now that it has
set up a sustainable UK
base its hype will only
get bigger. The offering
of tastier “artisanal”
fast food has certainly
attracted a large pool of
followers. Having tried
its offerings I can agree
that the hype is certainly
worth it.
