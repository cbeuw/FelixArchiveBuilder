unday 19th
November was the
date of Imperial
College Cross
Country & Athletics
Club’s first road race of
the year: the Brighton
10k.
With a meeting time
of 6am at London Bridge
Station, by the early hours
50 students were already
rising groggily from
their beds, eyes blearily
checking their phones
for the quickest route
Citymapper could find
to transport them across
Central London at such
an unearthly hour on a
Sunday morning.
Impressively, despite
attendees using a myriad
of different routes to get
to the station by the Shard,
almost everyone made it
onto the train in time.
Upon arrival on the
south coast, the team
invaded the local Weth-
erspoons; not for any
pre-race drinks – our
athletes are far too dis-
ciplined for that – but
to make full use of the
toilets in order to avoid
the notorious queues that
inevitably awaited them
for the loos beside the
race start.
The air was rather
chilly, and many members
attempted to keep as many
layers on as possible for
as long as possible before
theyheadedtothestartline
in just a vest and criminal-
ly short shorts. With 1300
competitors in the race
the starting funnel was
packed, but chip timing
allowed some runners to
tactically start nearer the
back to give themselves
the psychological boost of
overtaking people during
their race.
The race was set
underway promptly at
9:30 and they were off!
Crowds of spectators
lined the first few hundred
metres but the sounds of
cheering and support soon
gave way to the rumble of
racing feet pounding the
Brighton roads and rush
of heavy breathing. The
course was simple – 3km
out along the road beside
the promenade before
returning along the same
3km straight and contin-
uing 2km past the start/
finish before a final 180
degree turn (π radians
if you must) and a 2km
surge to the finish line.
The ideal race conditions
that greeted the runners
were a far cry from the
2016 edition which saw
the race cancelled just
hours before the sched-
uled start time due to
the high winds of Storm
Angus. Clear blue skies
watched over this year’s
event for the duration, yet
the shining sun offered
little warmth. Fortunately,
the exothermic nature of
respiration in the mito-
chondria of the athletes’
cells soon warmed them
up and spurred them on.
Being along the seafront,
there was an inevitable
breeze on the course. Nev-
ertheless, with Imperial’s
athletes tactically forming
groups to ease the stretch
into the wind this had a
negligible impact on their
performance.
ICXCAC also provided
much entertainment
for the locals with the
commentator at the finish
at one point remarking:
“Another Imperial
runner! And a dab! And
ANOTHER dab by yet
another runner from that
fine London university”
First home in a navy
and red vest was Fergus
Johnson in a new personal
best of 35:30, closely
followedbySarahJohnson
in 35:38, who came 2nd
lady overall to win a
number of prizes. Imperi-
al’s top 5 was rounded out
by Men’s Captain Lewis
Jackson’s PB of 35:57,
Matt Douthwaite in an
impressive 36:23, and
Jack McKeon breaking
37 minutes for the first
time with 36:54. Georgia
Curry (38:02), Anna
Lawson (40:38), Alex
Stuart-Smith (42:10), and
Stephanie Hewitt (42:15)
filled out the top 5 places
for Imperial’s girls.
Post-race, the squad
celebrated with the usual
cake ritual and headed
back to the drinking
establishment they had
previously utilised for
its bathroom facilities.
However, to their dismay,
the institution had already
been invaded by a rival
Imperial society: ICSM
Light Opera (see last
week’s centrefold for a
profile of the culprits).
After a few frantic calls
to numerous pubs in the
local area (“yes, we’d
like to seat fifTY, not
fifTEEN”) the runners
found a suitable place
back near the start line
with picturesque views of
the famous Brighton Pier
and the gentle breaking
waves of the English
Channel.
After ample refuelling
and a visit to view the
questionable “tic-tac”
machine in the gents, the
post-race celebrations
continued with a trip to the
beach accompanied by a
few more refreshing bev-
erages to “rehydrate” after
the day’s exertion. A few
brave members opted for
some shallow paddling,
and two madmen decided
they quite fancied a (very
brief) swim in the refresh-
ing (i.e. ice-cold) waters.
Finally, to end the
day the weary athletes
returned to where their
visit to Brighton began
and toasted the absence of
ISCM Light Opera before
the train journey back to
the capital.
