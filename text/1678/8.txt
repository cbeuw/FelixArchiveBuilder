In conversation with Professor Lord Robert Winston
Chris Richardson chats science communication with Imperial’s resident Professor of Science and Society.
LRW, good morning.
Good morning.
You are a person
of many hats. How
would you describe
what you do?
Well, they’re all
crumpled hats, that’s
for sure! I spend my
mornings in the college
and afternoons in West-
minster, peppered with a
lot of educational outreach
throughout the week.
The common thread
here is communica-
tion. What is the role
of science communi-
cators in engaging
with the public?
It’s a very good
question. As a science
communicator, you’re
always at risk because
you’re not necessarily
an expert in the field that
you’re communicating.
But the great thing about
science is that you can
work it out from first prin-
ciples. For me, science
communication is about
conveying that science
often isn’t as difficult as
it’s perceived to be. In the
broader context of society,
people need to be able
to make wise decisions
with respect to various
issues. On, say, GM crops,
CRISPR, and antibiotic
resistance.
Communication is
one thing, but we’re
seeing a worrying in-
creaseinevidencede-
nial in our post-truth
world. How should
we combat this?
It’s very easy when
you come from a place
like Imperial to think that
you’re a ‘master of the
universe’. But we need
to be modest and humble
when communicating
with the public. And to
be prepared to listen, not
just talk. Knowledge itself
lacks a moral dimension:
that dimension becomes
relevant once we start
to harness knowledge,
and that is a fundamental
message that science
communication should
get across.
You’ve previously
said that “absolute
certainty in either sci-
ence or religion can
lead to serious prob-
lems”. Why would ab-
solute certainty in sci-
ence be a bad thing?
We only have to look
at Oppenheimer to see
that absolute certainty
in science is a bad thing.
We have to be absolutely
clear of what our ethical
principles are. To borrow
a metaphor often used by
religion: we must respect
the sanctity of human
life. And that means
respecting the autonomy
of individuals in a society.
Both religion – and
science – are dangerous
when they’re certain.
Your Wohl Reach Out
Lab here at Imperial
and Utterly Amazing
books both target
younger audiences.
Is there a reason you
have adopted this de-
mographic as a strat-
egy?
We are not going to
reinvent science education
at secondary school, and
younger brains are much
more plastic, much more
open to change. Eight-
year-olds have no rules
and often ask all sorts of
questions. We need to
imprint good attitudes
at a young age. That’s
why I’ve concentrated on
younger audiences.
Can you remember
a moment when you
were a part of this
age group and felt in-
spired by science?
I was about twelve
years old. Back in the 50s
we didn’t do science until
we were much older. A
boring old master stood
in front of the class with
his hands behind his back,
wittering on about chem-
istry. It was utterly, devas-
tatingly boring. But then
there was a monumental
explosion, and the entire
room was filled with
smoke. From that moment
on all we wanted to do
was make explosions! Of
course nowadays we’re
much more reflective,
trying to incorporate the
concepts behind the fun
and explosions.
Let’s finish with some
quick-fire questions.
What’s your favourite
piece of lab equip-
ment?
A simple light micro-
scope. Once you have
looked down one at rela-
tively low power you can
see the beauty of things
that you didn’t dream
possible. That was what
really hooked me into
my research. I remember
being mesmerised by
the sight of the fallopian
tube, and the exquisite
beauty of how the egg is
transported. It was the
microscope that showed
me that.
What do you think
about the link be-
tween academia and
business?
People like Musk are
inspirational. Without him
we’d be further behind in,
say, carbon-free transport.
He’s changing the nature
of the game.
Which area of re-
search currently most
excites you?
Neuroscience. The
whole notion of human
consciousness is of key
importance to biology,
and to us. If we’re really
going into the realms of
AI and machine learning,
then consciousness
becomes a very important
thing to understand, and
we’re still very primitive
in our understanding.
Science communica-
tion as a field is go-
ing from strength to
strength. Why is that?
One of the reasons why
it’s evolving is that we’re
better able to express our-
selves. For instance, by
honing our ability to write
well, and in a way that is
engaging. The Science
Challenge is helping
people to do that, and I am
delighted to be involved
with it.
LRW, best of luck with
the SciChal launch.
Thank you.

RCSU Science Challenge 2018: One small step, one
giant leap
“The smallest
of changes
can result in
the biggest of
shifts”
RCSU Science Challenge Chair Ansh Bhatnagar explains why everyone should get involved in this year’s
competition.

T
he Science
Challenge is an
annual science
communication
competition run by the
RCSU. It is your chance
to submit an entry com-
municating your passion
for science, and to win up
to £1000. Choose to enter
in one of the four catego-
ries, answering one of the
questions chosen by our
panel of judges according
to the theme. The theme
for this year, chosen with
help of a student vote, is
“One Small Step, One
Giant Leap”.
While the theme obvi-
ously nods to the famous
first words said on the
Moon, it is also a metaphor
for what happens often in
science: that the smallest
of changes can result
in the biggest of shifts.
In almost every area of
science, there are count-
less examples of phenom-
ena like this.
Consider the structure
of the universe – why
are there regions of
the universe which are
more densely packed
with galaxy clusters
than other areas? Tiny
fluctuations in energy
density at the beginning
of the universe were
‘magnified’ by inflation,
and led to the large-scale
structure of the universe
we see today – entire
regions more populated
with galaxy clusters than
others, simply because
those regions happened
tive to small changes, such
as those on our planet.
Climate change presents
massive effects: a change
in average air temperature
of just 2°C is enough to
cause large rises in sea
levels and vastly increase
the risk of major flooding
throughout the world, with
devastating consequences
for ecosystems.
The theme can also be
extended to how seem-
ingly small contributions
to scientific research lead
to milestone discoveries.
For example, Photograph
51 is an X-Ray diffraction
image of DNA taken in
1952 at Rosalind Frank-
lin’s King’s College lab.
Watson and Crick later
used this image to deduce
the double-helical struc-
ture of DNA, providing a
breakthrough in biochem-
istry. Without the small
step made by Franklin’s
lab, this giant leap in our
interesting questions,
reminding us of the small,
meaningful things that go
on in science. Come along
to the launch on Tuesday,
where the judges will
announce their questions.
There will be scientific
demonstrations hosted
by a variety of science
societies, as well as free
food. Don’t miss out
on the keynote speech,
which will be delivered
by Lord Robert Winston,
the Science Challenge
Ambassador.
You have until 12pm on
Monday 22nd
of January
2018 to submit an entry.
