S
eeing another
part of the world
is quite an ex-
citing prospect
for anyone: different
foods, culture, history,
and – most importantly
– visiting beautiful book-
stores and discovering
authors you would not
have heard of otherwise.
Picking up a book, albeit
translated to English, by
a local author has been a
tremendously rewarding
experience. These writers
provide an excellent
snapshot of their country,
drawing upon the area’s
history, socioeconomic
and cultural backgrounds,
and quite often, their own
personal experiences. To
read the book and be able
to see the actual location
or art piece referenced
simultaneously magnifies
the enjoyment of both the
trip (and its memories)
and of the read. To that
end, I have always made
an effort to find a nice
bookstore in whichever
country I visit and pur-
chase an appropriate book.
Examples of such finds
include Lafcaido Hearn’s
Kokoro from Japan, Cees
Nooteboom’s Rituals
from The Netherlands,
and Toomas Vint’s The
Sweepstakes of Love from
Estonia, amongst others.
Toomas Vint’s The
Sweepstakes of Love
I bought this book
from a small bookstore
in Tallinn, half expect-
ing a treatise on love,
the human experience,
futility etc. Rather, Vint
wrote a sophisticated two
part series. The first part
consists of a semi-auto-
biographical collection of
short stories conceptually
similar to what I am sure
anyone who enjoys
silent contemplation and
reading does daily. Picture
the inner monologue we
all have, narrating our
thoughts, feelings, and
actions in relation to
our changing selves and
surroundings. From that
description, we add layers
of nuance, reflections, and
philosophical musings
to paint a personal story
and occasionally, we
might embellish the truth
slightly or conceive of
stories for other people
we briefly encounter.
Vint skilfully crafts such
a story, describing scenes
from his life growing up
and living in Soviet-era
Estonia as an artist. In an
early story, Vint describes
the time he attended a
Soviet Pioneers camp,
exploring the tension that
existed between Russian
and western parts of the
union, resulting in Vint
being beaten up. Another
story describes Vint’s
run-in with the KGB after
his close friend defects
from the Soviet Union,
resulting in both Vint and
his wife being investigat-
ed thoroughly. The second
part, aptly titled ‘A Flock
of Delusions’ consists
of purely fictional short
stories in a postmodern
style and is worth a read
by itself.
We are remarkably
ahistorical about the
good or bad that goes
on around us. In a bid to
move on, people quickly
relegate the past events
that affected them barely
a generation ago. Visiting
the KGB museum at the
Viru Hotel in Tallinn was
a poignant reminder of
the extent of control on
thought and life by the
Soviet State. Reading
Vint’s description of
his own experiences
and seeing his art in the
KUMU museum (Vint
is a painter as well) rein-
forced the images I saw
and provided me insight
into Estonian culture and
perspectives.
Cees Nooteboom’s
Rituals
What made this read
interesting within the
contextofseeingtheworld
isn’t too much about the
content, but rather where it
was purchased. This book
was purchased in Maas-
tricht at the Bookstore
Dominicanen, supposedly
one of the most beautiful
bookstores in the world. It
was quite the sight, seeing
a bookstore in a stunning
13th century church: the
sunlight strikes the books
to magical effects and
intricate murals adorn the
ceiling.
Rituals itself was quite
the fascinating read.
Nooteboom constructs
a sublime narrative,
weaving in existentialism
in how people structure
their lives, the experience
of foreign cultures, and
then challenges the reader
to reflect on how they
themselves approach
life. Inni Wintrop, the
dilettante, in recognising
the meaninglessness of
life, floats through it. He
entertains himself with art
and casual sex and funds
it by art sales and trading
on the stock market. He
is unable to commit to
anything: even his suicide
attempt failed following
his divorce. Nooteboom
interestingly contrasts
different approaches to
coping with the existential
dread we all have by in-
troducing a father-son pair
(the Taads) who, whilst
similar in their rigid
structuring of their lives in
self-contained bubbles, do
so very differently. Taads
senior thoroughly plans
every single minute of
his life, striving to extract
every moments’full worth
in a futile attempt to live
a full life. Taad junior on
the other hand contrived a
unique flavour of oriental
self-mortification, turning
to religion and spirituality
to cope with the same
dread everyone has. I
must point out that Rituals
was not at all depressing
and was one of the best
reads in 2016 for me.
I would highly rec-
ommend these books to
anyone looking for a read
over Christmas or at the
very least, those who want
to add a literary element
to their travels.
