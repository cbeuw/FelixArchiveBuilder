Real men don’t cry?
Men are still stigmatised when talking about emotional problems. This is having disastrous
consequences. We can do better.
R
ecently I heard
of the sad news
of a lad from
my old school
taking his own life at the
age of 20. As is often the
case he was the last person
you would expect to hear
such terrible news about,
always laughing, joking
and loved nothing more
than going to the football
with the lads. Although
stereotypes have changed
in recent times, there is
still social pressure for

men to be independent,
strong and bottle up their
emotion and worries.
Suicide is now the
leading cause of death
in men under the age
of 50. Let that statistic
sink in. Not cancer,
not disease, not car
accidents: suicide. From
this shocking statistic
it is clear that men are
not getting the help they
need and the stigma sur-
rounding men’s mental
health still very much
exists.
It is common for
people suffering from
mental health problems
to hide it effectively and
it is nearly always the
last people you would
expect. Two high profile
examples of this are
Tyson Fury and Dwayne
‘The Rock’ Johnson.
Both are seen as highly
successful and above all
‘tough guys’, however
both have opened up
about having suffered
with mental health
problems in the past.
Mental health can
affect anyone, but
stigmas and social pres-
sures prevent many men
opening up and getting
the help they desper-
ately need. We live in a
society where men feel
pressured to conform
to an often unrealistic
‘macho’ image and
talking about personal
problems is seen as a
weakness.
For over 10 years
men have been growing
moustaches in the name
of Movember, an in-
creasingly well known
non profit charity which
raises awareness for
men’s health, including
prostate cancer, tes-
ticular cancer, mental
health, and suicide
prevention. Since the
charity was launched
the campaign has raised
over £440m for research
into men’s health issues.
With charities like this
becoming ever more
popular, men’s mental
health is finally getting
the publicity it needs.
There is no question
that university life is
stressful; exams, course-
work deadlines, moving
away from home, and
any number of other
possibilities. Imperial
have a well established
Student Counselling
Service, with counsel-
lors available at South
Kensington, Hammer-
smith and Silwood Park
Campuses.
So what can we do?
In a generation when
suicide rates are as high
as ever, we all have a
responsibility to push
for a cultural change.
As guys, we should not
shy away from opening
up about our emotions
and we should reach out
to others in their time of
need.
So come on lads, look
out for each other.
If you need support
you can call The Sa-
maritans (116 123), or
CALM (0800 58 58 58)

I
don’t know if I’m so
tired or have grown
used to the wind that
it now has become
the norm to hear utter
destruction in the back-
ground but I feel like I’m
in a dream. I feel like I
woke up today in a dimen-
sion that was far removed
from the island I know
and I will be more certain
of that later today when
the sun comes up and
my home is unrecogniza-
ble.”– Jeanelle Brisbane,
at 12.18am on Tuesday
the 19th September.
The extract above
was taken from a journal
written during the night
that Hurricane Maria
hit Dominica, the third
largest English-speaking
island in the Caribbean.
Now confirmed as the
worst natural disaster the
country has on record,
Hurricane Maria took the
inhabitants of Dominica,
including Jeanelle and her
family, by surprise. The
eye of the storm, where
the severest of weather
and winds occur, was
predicted to pass safely
around the north shore
of the island, but instead
travelled directly across
the country, ransacking
communities and ecosys-
tems as it passed.
Fundraising began
swiftly after the hurricane
took place, seeking to
provide food and aid to
those in communities
affected by the storms.
At Imperial’s Silwood
Campus, a Christmas
Drive was undertaken
to collect toys for the
children of Dominica. The
Drive was organised by
Jeanelle, who is a master’s
student at Imperial, in
order to spread happiness
to her home that she had
to witness change so dra-
matically.
An advocate for con-
servation, Jeanelle now
turns to working on im-
plementing a conservation
action plan for Dominica.
Prior to September,
Dominica was two-thirds
virgin forest, meaning
that the ecological niches
and communities there
are of immense intrinsic
value. After the hurricane,
sightings of Dominica’s
rare species become vital
in confirming Dominica’s
ability to heal, as nearly
the entire island was
stripped of its lush, green
forests that housed native
species. In the extract
below, written a few days
after Maria hit, Jeanelle
describes the stripping of
her home’s forests that
coated the island, and her
optimism for it.
“My island is still
home. She is still beauti-
ful and now you can see
every curve that graces
her body. She still stands
tall and strong like her
people. But she is crying.”
It will take time for
Dominica to recover,
but with international
help and a strong sense
of a community striving
together, the island will
regain its natural beauty
once more.
If you would like to

conservation action plans

could be done, please
