2017 Imperial Cinema Winter All-Nighter
C
elebrate the end
of term with
a night full of
films and fun at
Imperial Cinema’s annual
cult event, the Winter
All-Nighter! Starting in
the evening of the 12th
of
December, five films will
be shown back-to-back,
finishing at 7am the next
morning. Pro tip: Bring a
blanket and pillow!
18:30 Thor: Ragnarok
We at Imperial Cinema
*love* Taika Waititi. What
We Do in the Shadows and
Hunt for the Wilderpeople
are both All-Nighter
alumni, so to speak. So
there was no way we were
going to withhold this
from you: Thor, Hulk,
Loki et al. getting the
full psychedelic absurdist
Kiwi treatment. Forecast:
Zero chance of taking
yourself too seriously.
100% chance of fun.
21:00 Blade Runner
2049
Scott Ridley’s 1982
cult classic gets a worthy
follow-up that is just
as bleak, violent, and
visually stunning as the
original. Ryan Gosling
melts into the universe’s
fluoro-grime aesthetic as
if he’d always been there;
it’s a genuinely new, inter-
esting story, rather than a
re-hash of Deckard’s past,
but with an appropriate
amount of Harrison Ford
sprinkled in.
01:00 Murder on the
Orient Express
Gaze upon the glory
that is Kenneth Branagh’s
magnificent moustache
and lose yourself in the
delicious twists and turns
of the Agatha Christie
classic. Don’t lose
yourself in that mous-
tache though, because you
might never see the light
of day again. The cast is
ridiculously star-studded,
the costumes sumptuous,
and the moustache ginor-
mous. Have I mentioned
the moustache?
03:15 The Death of
Stalin
A black comedy about
the horrors of the last days
of Stalin’s reign doesn’t
seem like an obvious idea,
but who better to pull it
off than Armando Ianucci,
he of The Thick of It
fame. Starring such greats
as Jason Isaacs, Steve
Buscemi, and Michael
Palin bouncing of each
other, be prepared to laugh
a lot (and have some of it
stick in your throat).
05:20 Happy Death
Day
Remember that film,
Groundhog Day? With
Bill Murray? Kind of
boring, right? Would be
better with… MORE
STABBING. A college
student wakes up on her
birthday, goes about her
day, and gets brutally
murdered. Then wakes
up, on her birthday, again.
Yeah so it’s a little deriv-
ative, but the premise is
good and it’s almost time
to go home.
The All-Nighter takes
place on Tuesday, 12th
December in the Union
Concert Hall, 2nd floor
of the Union Building,
Beit Quad. Tickets are
£10 online (until 4pm on
the day) and £12 on the
door. If you don’t fancy
staying all night, tickets
for individual films can
be purchased at £3 each
on the door. An additional
£5 buys you all-night, all-
you-can-eat hot food and
drinks.
Tickets available now
on https://tickets.imperi-
alcinema.co.uk.
