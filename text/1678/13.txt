Justice League fails to save the (cinematic) day
J
ustice League had
a lot to prove from
the get go. With
three critically
panned films and only one
moderate successfully
movie in Wonder Woman,
Warner Brothers and DC
Comics had a lot to make
up for and improve upon.
While Justice League is
ultimately a step in the
right direction, it doesn’t
quite hit the mark and
is an overall haphazard
execution. Throughout
this review, I’ll be con-
stantly comparing this
film to other superhero
movies. While some of
you may think this unfair,
I disagree for two reasons.
First, there are enough of
them at this point that we
pretty much have a bench-
mark for what is expected;
second of all, this is the
fricking Justice League.
They are the most well
known superhero team
to fans and to the general
public, hence they had a
lot to live up to.
One improvement over
the mediocre Batman V
Superman is that the story
actually makes sense and
is not overly complicated.
Having said that, it is very
simple and conventional;
generic bad guy wreaks
havoc and the heroes have
to come together and save
the day. Some of you may
argue that this is a block-
buster movie where you
should focus on the spec-
tacle and ignore the story.
However, other superhero
films have been able to go
big and beyond while at
the same time exploring
themes and ideas, such as
family and relationships in
Guardians of the Galaxy,
or centering on a character
and watching their growth
and development like in
Spider-Man Homecoming
or any good origin story
for that matter.
The main villain,
Steppenwolf, is as paper
thin as the plot. First of
all, a personal gripe: out
of all the villains in comic
book lore, they went with
Steppenwolf, a character
so obscure that I’m sure
only hardcore fanboys
would know who he is.
On the one hand, this
did mean that the writers
could have written him
in a new and interesting
direction. Unfortunately,
they don’t really do this
and Steppenwolf is as
bland and uninteresting
as most marvel movie
villains. Not only that,
but he’s also 100% CGI,
which honestly, is not the
nicest thing to look at for
the most part.
One area where the film
does succeed though is in
the Leaguers themselves.
All the characters are
given an adequate amount
of screen time and come
with their degrees of per-
sonality and quirks. They
are also written much
better and more optimistic
compared to some char-
acters’ dark and dreary
portrayals in Batman V
Superman. It might have
taken three films, but they
finally nail the character
of Superman and Henry
Cavill is able to bring
the warmth and soul that
makes Superman such a
hopeful and heroic icon.
The overall tone of
the film was also more
hopeful and optimistic
than the previous DCEU
entries, save for Wonder
Woman, which is how
I believe superhero
adaptations should be
and what Marvel gets
right. I’m not saying you
can’t have stories with a
darker direction, but that
shouldn’t come at the cost
of character and story
development as is the case
in Batman V Superman.
For those of you who
don’t know, the produc-
tion process was a bit of
a mess with two directors
having been in charge of
the film at different times.
For the most part, the film
feels like a Zack Snyder
movie with its darker
atmosphere and operatic
aesthetic. Some scenes
have a very distinct Joss
Whedon feel and while
it’s alright for the most
part, some scenes are just
a bit jarring and seem a
little out of place.
One of the main issues
with this film, however,
is the fact that there
are no real stakes. The
parademons facing the
League are just awkward
and bland CGI monsters
with nothing particularly
interesting about them.
We never see anyone
really have their life in
danger, be it the heroes or
any civilians. In Avengers,
for example, there was
always a sense of danger
and threat in most of the
action sequences, either to
the main characters or to
any unfortunate bystand-
ers caught in the crossfire.
Without these kinds of
situations, it’s hard to
really get engrossed in the
Justice League and care as
much as we should. For
some odd reason, there
are some scenes which
focus on a particular
payoff which leads to a
lacklustre payoff. If these
scenes were scrapped in
favour of other things that
are more plot-relevant, the
movie would have been a
touch better.
Warner Bros. are
clearly trying to catch
up to Marvel Studios
and reach that level of
success before the super-
hero movie bubble bursts.
With Justice League,
they were trying to do a
course correction from
Batman V Superman as
well as make audiences
care enough about these
characters to want to see
more of them. While the
film mostly succeeds in
these objectives and is at
least somewhat entertain-
ing, it does so in a sloppy
and flawed execution that
leaves one frustrated for
something more.
