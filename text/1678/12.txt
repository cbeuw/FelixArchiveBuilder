In the penultimate entry of our thrilling trilogy, we continue our run-through of films with the biggest Oscar
aspirations.
FILM

A
s the year
winds down
I always
find myself
reflecting back on the
best films to emerge over
the past twelve months,
and this inevitably leads
to speculation on which
ones might end up with
Academy Award nomina-
tions and wins. These two
categories do not always
align, and last week I
ran through some of the
films that had awards
aspirations, but are now
considered long shots, or
out of the race entirely.
The first few prizes of
the season have begun
to be handed out, with
the Gotham Awards on
Monday and the National
Board of Review reveal-
ing their year-end lists on
Tuesday. This makes the
continuation of this run
down of Oscar contenders
all the more pertinent. So
here we go.
POSSIBILITIES
Cary Fukunaga, inci-
dentally a screenwriter
on It, will be feeling a
whole lot of frustration if
Mudbound picks up Oscar
nominations. Fresh from
delivering a tremendous
first season of True De-
tective for HBO on tele-
vision, he wrote, shot, and
directed war drama Beasts
of No Nation for Netflix.
It should have been an
awards season contender,
and in particular Idris
Elba, who won the Screen
Actors Guild award for
best supporting actor for
his powerful turn as the
Commandant, should
have been a major can-
didate for the Academy
Award (he is to date the
only actor to win an SAG
award and not be nominat-
“This year
Call Me by
Your Name
arrived like a
juggernaut”
ed for the Oscar). Instead,
the Academy turned its
noses up at Netflix’s day
and date release scheme
and refused to acknowl-
edge the film. Netflix are
sticking by their release
strategy, but have brought
in a number of industry
veterans with experi-
ence of running awards
campaigns to help push
Mudbound. Dee Rees’
period drama, following
two families in rural Mis-
sissippi post-World War
II, would be a strong con-
tender for a best picture
nomination were it with
Fox Searchlight, Sony
Pictures Classics, Focus
Features, or Amazon. Yet
her film is with Netflix,
and it remains to be seen if
they can mount a serious
awards campaign and
win over the Academy
with a system that seems
to undermine the tradi-
tional theatre experience.
It is possible that the
new influx of younger
Academy voters may aid
their attempts.
Also benefiting from
the shake up to the
Academy membership
could be Get Out. Jordan
Peele’s suspenseful horror
played well at Sundance
and then stunned the
world, raking in huge
sums against a very small
budget. Hugely profit-
able, sheer hype alone
may drive it into awards
contention. On Monday
it picked up three prizes
at the Gotham Awards,
and on Tuesday it was
named on the National
Board of Review’s list
of the best films of the
year, as well as winning
best ensemble and best
directorial debut. It is
worth bearing in mind that
films such as Baby Driver,
Logan, The Disaster
Artist, and Downsizing,
that are now considered
out of the awards race
(bar a couple of possible
nominations for actor
and adapted screenplay
for The Disaster Artist),
were also name-dropped
by the National Board of
Review. That being said,
Get Out has a whole lot of
momentum behind it right
now.
Similarly, Wonder
Woman, remarkably
Patty Jenkins’ first film
since she guided Charlize
Theron to Oscar glory in
Monster, was a box office
smash. Though beyond
the surface its content is
still formulaic tent-pole
material, the current
narrative seems to be that
this is some kind of great
feminist art piece (did
anyone see Elle or The
Love Witch last year?),
and that may resonate
with the new left wing
influx of Academy voters.
It is somehow possible
that Wonder Woman will
succeed where The Dark
Knight failed, and be the
first superhero film to earn
a best picture nomination.
Amazon’s hopes will
now be pinned on their
Summer release The Big
Sick, which is the highest
grossing indie of the year.
Playing well at Sundance,
Kumail Nanjiani plays
himself in the intriguing
story of how him and his
wife fell in love, in the
best romantic comedy to
surface for years.
One film that may
actually suffer from the
changes to the voting body
is Joe Wright’s Darkest
Hour. Wright’s Atone-
ment was a seven-time
Oscar nominee, but his
latest is not as strong. Fol-
lowing Winston Churchill
during his early days as
prime minister during the
Second World War, this
feels like it would have
been a lock for a best
picture nomination a few
years ago, but with the
Academy expanding the
type of films it is willing
to honour, the only sure
thing with this one is
Gary Oldman’s best actor
nomination.
MAJOR THREATS
These films should earn
best picture nominations,
but will likely fall short in
their pursuit of the grand
prize. Guillermo del Toro
Will Darkest Hour be holding the V for Victory at the Oscars next year? // Jack English Focus Features
“Wonder
Woman will
succeed where
The Dark
Knight failed,
and be the
first superhero
film to earn a
best picture
nomination”
returns with his best film
since Pan’s Labyrinth.
That film won three of
its six Oscar nominations
and is a modern classic.
Del Toro has a penchant
for fairy tales, and this
one is a Douglas Sirk-type
romance film concerning
the burgeoning affection
between a mute janitor
and a mysterious Mer-
man-like creature. The
Shape of Water picked up
the Golden Lion at Venice,
and should certainly
receive nominations for
picture, direction, screen-
play, and Sally Hawkins’
lead performance as well
as registering in many of
the technical categories.
Amidst the glitz and
glam of Cannes, the ea-
gle-eyed of us will have
picked out the return of
Sean Baker as one to
watch. Baker is most
famous for shooting his
sensational Tangerine on
an iPhone 5c, the same
phone the rest of us used
for blurry night out photos
and questionable selfies.
With The Florida Project,
he does continue to use
some iPhone footage,
but the majority of this
sublime film, set on the
outskirts of the Walt
Disney World resort
and told from a child’s
perspective, is shot on
glorious 35mm film.
This one will have you
smiling and crying at the
same time, a look that will
make you glad you are sat
in a dark theatre where no
one can see you. A24 suc-
ceeded in pushing another
Florida-based project,
Moonlight, all the way to
the big prize last year, but
ultimately The Florida
Project will probably fall
just short.
Another A24 distribut-
ed picture is Lady Bird,
the semi-autobiograph-
ical directorial debut of
renowned indie actress
Greta Gerwig. Driven by
a fierce performance from
Saoirse Ronan, Gerwig’s
direction is assured and
authentic. This film
emerged unexpectedly
strong from the fall
festivals, and Ronan will
cement herself as one of
the finest young actresses
in the world with a third
Oscar nomination at the
young age of 23. Gerwig’s
original screenplay (which
is allegedly 350 pages
long and yet has managed
to yield a 93 minute film)
should also earn a nod, and
Laurie Metcalfe is a good
candidate for supporting
actress. Rising young
actors Timothée Chalamet
and Lucas Hedges also
deliver the goods here.
Eight of the last ten
winners of the People’s
Choice Award at the
Toronto International
Film Festival have gone
on to receive a best picture
nomination, making it a
very good indicator of
awards season success.
Past winners include
Slumdog Millionaire, The
King’s Speech, 12 Years a
Slave, and La La Land, all
of which won best picture
(of course La La Land’s
victory lasted a matter of
seconds as they had to
hand over their award to
actual winner Moonlight).
This year Three Billboards
Outside Ebbing, Missouri
pipped runner-up The
Shape of Water to the
prize. Martin McDonagh
has a strong track record
with dark comedies, but
this is the first time it all
truly comes together in
a cohesive manner for
him. Fortunately, this co-
incides with his best cast
ever, including Frances
McDormand, Woody
Harrelson, Sam Rockwell,
Lucas Hedges, and Caleb
Landry Jones. There is a
searing drama against the
backdrop of McDonagh’s
black humour which
makes this film far more
effective and profound
than anything he has
done before. McDormand
delivers an intimidatingly
powerful performance as
the foul-mouthed mother
who takes matters into
her own hands when the
police struggle to come up
with a suspect in the case
of the rape and murder
of her teenage daughter.
She is the favourite to win
best actress, adding to her
win for Fargo. Rockwell
may score a first nod for
supporting actor. Mc-
Donagh’s screenplay is a
shoe in for a nomination
too.
We’re gonna reveal our
overall winners in next
week’s Felix grand finale
– tune in next week for the
thrilling conclusion!
