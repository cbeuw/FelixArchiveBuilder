M
ost people
think of
Thailand as
a party desti-
nation to go to with “the
lads”, packed with cheap
nights out, but my trip
was a bit different. I’m a
lone female traveller who
doesn’t understand clubs
and booze, but I do love
cycling, and Thailand has
some great mountains
with well-maintained
roads. And thus, I went
on a cycling holiday to
Thailand.
Across the world
Truth be told, this trip
wasn’t my idea. There’s
an annual cycling festival
held in Chiang Mai that
I’d wanted to go to the
previous two years but
couldn’t due to uni – but
this year was my year!
My exams finished in
May, so in mid-July I
was to head off to Chiang
Mai with my bike. A taxi
to the airport would have
been £40+, but fortunately
there’s a courier service,
Airportr (#notspons),
from central London to
various Heathrow termi-
nals for only £30. So I
packed my bike up into
a cardboard bike box,
and it was picked up and
taken swiftly to Heathrow
Terminal 2. Meanwhile, I
picked up some Thai baht
(local currency), prepared
my room to be sublet, and
then made my way down
to the airport by tube. I
have to admit that leaving
for a month-long trip to
the other side of the world
gavemelastminutenerves
so my flatmate basically
had to push me out the
door. When I finally made
it to Heathrow, I collected
my bike and proceeded
to check in – other than
having to fit the bike box
in the lift and through the
maze of crowd control
stanchions, it all went
smoothly. I was very
pleased that my chosen
airline, Eva Airways,
treated my bike very well.
Oh, and a minor detail – I
walked past Andy Murray
at the airport, who was
arriving home from the
French Open (just casual
things).
First day adventures
My journey from
Bangkok airport to my
accommodation was
much more challenging.
Since my flight was
delayed, I was afraid to
miss the train to Chiang
Mai, so in a mad-panic I
booked an Airbnb in the
centre of Bangkok. Also,
when I picked up my
bike at the airport, I had
it put together for me in
a bike shop, which, on
reflection, was a bad idea.
By the time I got it back,
it was late, and I had a
lot of luggage with me,
so I couldn’t cycle to my
accommodation; instead,
I took a taxi but had to
remove the front wheel for
the bike to fit. Then unfor-
tunately, after a draining
journey, I didn’t manage
to get a well-deserved
sleep – in the extreme heat
and humidity, the AC only
worked with the lights on,
and my jet lag also didn’t
help in the process. But
that’s what travelling is
all about – stepping out of
your comfort zone to gain
invaluable experiences.
Chasing cool air
The next day I booked
an overnight train to
Chiang Mai, but I still had
some time in Bangkok
before it departed. I ended
up visiting a cute little
local vegan restaurant
(shout out to happycow.
net for the recommenda-
tion; again, #notspons),
where I met a lovely Thai-
born Chinese lady, who,
at 50 years old, was just
starting to learn Mandarin
to reconnect with her
family back in China.
I spent the rest of my
time at the train station
because it was the only
place nearby with air-con-
ditioning (it’s REALLY
hot, okay?), which also
offered various shops and
free WiFi for international
tourists (#priorities).
Finally, I boarded my
train to Chiang Mai with
my bike – the process was
simple but required extra
payment. I took the sleeper
train instead of flying or
taking a taxi because it’s
an iconic part of a trip to
Thailand and I also aimed
to arrive in Chiang Mai
early to have enough time
to find accommodation
there. Here’s a tip for you:
if you’re going on holiday,
book your accommoda-
tion in advance, at least for
a couple of nights. Please.
Just trust me on this. My
experience wasn’t awful
by any means, but it would
have been much better if
I’d done the bookings in
advance.
A month of cycling
Upon arrival in Chiang
Mai, I caught a songthaew
(a type of passenger
vehicle) to the area I
wanted to stay in. Fortu-
nately, this time my bike
fitted in the car, but since
songthaews don’t have
Calling all cyclists: take your bike on holiday for an
unforgettable cycling adventure
Tourists love Thailand for its beautiful beaches, hot weather, and unconventional attractions. However, recent
Imperial graduate Charlotte Pickering experienced a different kind of holiday – she went to a cycling festival in
Chiang Mai and spent a month exploring the city by bike.

backs, I held onto my
bike to stop it from falling
off. There was another
passenger, a Swiss girl,
and it turned out she
was there because of the
same festival, though not
as a participant. When I
mentioned that I had not
booked a place to stay
yet, she kindly invited
me to stay at hers, while I
figured it out. We dumped
our stuff at hers and spent
most of the day walking
around the city, eating
exotic fruit, and then going
on a tuk tuk tour (another
Thai vehicle). In the end,
we decided it was a scam
and refused to pay full
price for it. So be vigilant!
We eventually arrived in
the neighbourhood I was
hoping to stay in, and after
wandering down a dead-
end, we met a friendly
Thai lady who gave us a
ride on her motorcycle to
the right place. Finally,
after hours of searching, I
ended up at some student
accommodation, where I
managed to rent a room
for the rest of my trip. As
I was moving my stuff
from my Airbnb to the
new place, my songthaew
driver wasn’t impressed
with me taking the bike
on-board, charging me
more for it. But since it
was late at night and we
were in the middle of
nowhere, I had to accept
the sudden price hike.
And at this point, my
cycling holiday actually
started! I spent a few
days cycling and walking
around with the Swiss
girl (who rented a bike, as
there are many bike rental
shops in Chiang Mai).
Then, I cycled up Doi
Suthep, a mountain right
outside of Chiang Mai.
It took me two attempts,
thanks to my dodgy knee,
which was injured as I was
hit by a cab while cycling
in London. Nevertheless,
even if tiring, cycling up
the mountain was an in-
credible experience. The
road goes up to a classic
Thai Buddhist temple with
breath-taking views of the
city, well worth the chal-
lenging ride. However,
the ride down was abso-
lutely terrifying – going
that fast on a bike did
not feel safe, but drivers
in Chiang Mai are very
good around bicycles, so I
knew that controlling my
speed was the only thing
I needed to worry about.
In my opinion, cycling is
a great way to get around
Chiang Mai, since cars
and motorcycles are re-
spectful. Also, bike theft
is minimal – I did take a D
lock for peace of mind, but
a chain lock would have
been more than enough.
Many times I left my bike
parked unlocked, or just
locked to itself, and it was
still there when I got back.
And finally, my favourite
restaurant, Imm Aim, had
a bike rack outside which
held up to 8 bikes, so it’s
indeed a bike friendly city.
Time to come back
The journey back to
London was a bit differ-
ent. I decided to fly to
Bangkok instead of taking
the train, so I had to buy
a bike box in Chiang
Mai. These get sold for
recycling, meaning that
bike shops might not have
any, so if this is something
you need, it would be best
to seek one out a few days
in advance. I was staying
overnight in Bangkok so I
stored my packed bike at
the airport’s left luggage
service, which cost 100
baht for 24 hours. It’s
common knowledge that
when taking a bike on a
plane, the tyres should be
flat. However, the airlines
normally don’t check this,
and the inner tubes don’t
tend to explode under the
aircraft conditions. But
since my bike box had
small holes for holding
it, the lady who was
checking me in noticed
that I hadn’t put down my
tyres. Unfortunately, this
meant that I had to climb
upon the baggage scales
and put down both of my
tyres through this small
hole. In the future, I won’t
try to be cheeky and will
put down my tyres before-
hand, especially if they’re
visible through the box.
“Cycling is a
great way to
get around
Chiang Mai,
since cars and
motorcycles
are respectful.
Also, bike theft
is minimal”
“Breath-taking
views of the
city were well
worth the
challenging
ride”
The rest of the trip
was easy. Shout out to
my mum for picking me
up at Heathrow, saving
me from paying for the
bike shipping. That being
said, AirPortr was a great
service and I’d definitely
use them again. I’d also
recommend using the left
luggageserviceatairports,
e.g. to store your bike or
any other large luggage
pieces, if this can help
you with your journey. It
felt scary giving my bike
to people I didn’t know
in a foreign country but
it meant that I didn’t have
to lug a large box around
Bangkok again, which is
less than fun.
