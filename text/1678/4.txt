Actually stop and think about it: tuition fees
just don’t make sense
The arguments against tuition fees far outweigh any benefits their defendants claim. It’s time
to scrap them.

T
he debate over
tuition fees is one
of the most prev-
alent in British
politics, jostling with the
likes of Brexit and the
NHS crisis for the spot
of most important issue
facing young voters at the
general election earlier
this year. Obviously, as
the demographic who
suffer the most directly
from their imposition,
university students are
(at least at a glance)
overwhelmingly against
tuition fees and any pro-
posed increases to them,
hence writing an article
to a student newspaper in
opposition to them could
be seen as more than a
little pointless. However,
I shall attempt to outline
some of the plethora of ar-
guments against them that
go beyond mere financial
self-interest.
For starters, we have
the UK’s majorly flawed
student finance system,
which loans students the
money for their fees and
general living costs whilst
at university, in exchange
for repayments over the
30 years following a stu-
dent’s graduation, at a rate
of 9% of their salary over
£21,000 plus interest.
This system is certainly
a good deal for students,
as it almost completely
mitigates our losses if our
degree fails to add value
to our future earnings –
comparable to companies
that guarantee their
customers a refund if the
product they bought fails
to function as it should.
with only 55% of the
total money loaned ever
being repaid as things
stand. For those who
back tuition fees on the
basis that degrees ought
to be funded by people
who directly benefit from
them as opposed to the
taxpayer, this means that
around half of that £9250
per student per year is
tax-funded regardless.
This reduces the effective
amount graduates pay to
universities via the gov-
ernment loan scheme to
less than a quarter of total
university income.
These statistics explain
exactly why the argument
for tuition fees on the
basis that students ought
to foot their own costs is
absolutely bonkers: they
just cost everyone more.
As was conveniently
pointed out in last month’s
article in defence of fees,
the average graduate can
expect an annual salary
that is significantly higher
than those who do not
attend university – they
are the people who will
tend to go on to pay higher
taxes than the general
populace. In fact, due to
their salary premium, they
end up paying an average
of £8,000 more in income
tax than they borrowed to
pay for university in the
first place – this is on top
of the money they spend
in loan repayments.
A further issue with
our current system is the
emotive form of debate
facilitated by having a
loan system. When poli-
ticians and public figures
are commonly tossing
around such phrases as
“fifty thousand pounds
worth of debt”, can they
really be surprised when
students complain that it
doesn’t sound particularly
fair? Of course, this is
regularly followed by the
aforementioned statistics
to factor in the wider
economic benefits of
people attending univer-
sity. A more educated
population can innovate
more and perform more
highly skilled jobs, which
in turn means more money
is spent and earned in the
country, so governments
can take in more tax
revenue to spend on im-
proving or creating public
services, which increases
everyone’s quality of life.
Yes, these effects are dif-
ficult to measure and may
seem intangible, but they
improve everyone’s lives,
graduate or not. It seems
utterly ridiculous to eco-
nomically disincentivise
such behaviour!
Whilst these more
nuanced ways of looking
at the issue may not
appeal to the archaic view
that whatever one costs an
institution must be paid
back directly and precise-
ly, those of us who oppose
tuition fees may at least
take solace in knowing
that our viewpoint makes
demonstrably more sense.
The entirety of modern
Western civilisation is
based upon the fact that
life does not have to be a
zero-sum game – someone
somewhere doesn’t neces-
sarily have to pay a price
so that you can gain a
benefit. There are many
ways to fix this issue: a
graduate tax (which has its
problems, but is at least an
improvement), or perhaps
just generally raising
taxation levels slightly to
alleviate pressure on other
public services as well.
One thing is for certain:
tuition fees are not the
answer.

“A more
educated
population can
innovate more
and perform
more highly
skilled jobs”
about degrees adding
value to future earnings,
but once you’ve planted
the seed of that feeling of
injustice, you’ve already
gone a long way towards
polarising the argument.
All that’s needed to finish
it off is for another group
of people to start calling
young people “entitled”
and “ungrateful”, and lo
and behold, you’ve ended
any chance of rational
debate and compromise!
Of course, we’re yet to
even touch upon the actual
reason that governments
want their citizens to go
to university. Though I
would hate to generalise,
in my experience, those
who argue in favour of
tuition fees don’t tend
“We have the
UK’s majorly
flawed student
finance
system, which
is vastly
inefficaciou:
only 55% of
money lonaed
is paid back”
Nevertheless, it is
vastly inefficacious,
