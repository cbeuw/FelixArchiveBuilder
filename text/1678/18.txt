It’s time for us to make a stand on
climate change
There’s a clear place to start when it comes to Imperial’s impact on the
environment: it’s time to divest.

U
nless you’ve
been living
under a rock,
you’ve likely
found it impossible to
avoid Blue Planet II.
Nowhere else is the beauty
of the natural world as
apparent as in our oceans,
and the theatrics 1000
feet below the surface
often uncannily mirror
the dramas of our own
day-to-day lives. We pick
sides, and become entirely
invested in the fate of a
single octopus. All that
serves to make the sucker
punch, when it comes, all
the more gut-wrenching.
This stunning tapestry of
life and colour faces an
existential risk, and we’d
really rather not talk about
it: climate change.
When it comes to
climate change, I used
to do what most people
would – I ignored it as
best I could. The whole
thing was too overpower-
ing, and it’s often hard to
know where to start. As
a fresher, though, I took
a chance on joining the
Environmental Society.
Had I not gone to that
first meeting, I’d probably
have carried on as before,
having unconsciously
constructed a life that
didn’t really leave space
for caring about climate
change.
It’s easy to see why
we’d like to ignore
climate change; after
all, it’s hardly a cheery
subject. There’s growing
evidence of the toll that
climate change takes on
our mental health, even
disregarding its physical
effects on the globe. A
2009 report found that
Americans are already
suffering a “pre-traumatic
stress disorder” due to
the burden of climate
change on their minds;
the effect is even worse
among scientists in the
field. Reluctance to think
about such a painful topic
is pretty understandable.
The other key is the
fact that I was even able
to ignore climate change
at all. Part of this is that
the famously unreliable
British weather is actually
reliably dull by global
standards. While other
countries are already
feeling the impact of
stronger hurricanes
and prolonged summer
droughts, the UK is likely
to escape the worst effects.
first to suffer are often the
least-equipped to cope.
The recent COP23 summit
in Bonn – the largest
international gathering to
take action against climate
change – was presided
over by the government of
Fiji. The tiny island-nation
was unable to afford even
to host the conference
on climate change; how
on Earth is it supposed
to afford to protect itself
against the actual thing?
Having contributed
approximately zero to
the problem, and lacking
any infrastructure to deal
with it, Fiji and other
Pacific island nations will
nevertheless pay the price
for the lethargy of devel-
oped countries. We can
only afford to ignore the
problem at home because
Here’s what I’m up
to at the moment!
A
s Ethics and Environment Officer,
my job is to support and facilitate
campaigns to make our university
fairer, greener, and more
sustainable. Below are some things I’ve been
up to so far this term; if you think that there’s
something I’ve missed, or that I could help
you with, email me at icu-environmental@
ic.ac.uk
• Attending meetings with Deputy
President (Finance and Services) and Union
finance team to scrutinise the Union’s
divestment plans, and ensure that the
targets set out in last year’s divestment
paper are met.
• I’m in contact with the Union to help
shape the Union’s divestment branding and
publicity.
• As part of Divest Imperial, I’m
coordinating the hand-in of the petition
calling on College to divest from fossil fuels.

somebody else can’t in
theirs.
So what do we do? We
have a choice. One option
is to trust politicians and
big business to sort things
out, two groups that can
always be relied upon to
act in humanity’s best
interests. The other option
is that we try to make
a difference ourselves.
No one person can do it
alone; what’s needed is
a collective effort. Put
pressure on things that
are within your power to
change, and remember
that something is always
better than nothing.
One thing we all share
is Imperial – the clean,
green, hi-tech university
that recently came 141st
in
People & Planet’s league
table of the UK’s greenest
universities. We can do
better, and as students
we should demand that
we do better. A good
first step for the College
would be to remove
its dirty investments in
some of the planet’s most
unethical and unscientific
industries, the very same
ones gleefully paving the
way towards climate ca-
tastrophe. Divestment sets
an example for society
to follow, and we can
applaud the example our
own Union set by voting
to remove its funds from
fossil fuels. College’s
reluctance to follow suit
is scandalous, and it’s
up to us to force their
hand. If we don’t, we risk
throwing away all we’ve
ever known: the blue
planet we call home.
