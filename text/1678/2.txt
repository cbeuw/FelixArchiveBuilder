upon Tyne Hospitals and
University Hospitals of
Leicester NHS Foun-
dation Trusts will also
continue to offer CHD
services.
In a statement, Bob
Bell, the Trust’s chief
executive, said they
“welcome the opportunity
to continue developing
the benefits of a collabo-
ration with King’s Health
Partners across cardiac
and respiratory medicine
and research”.
He went on to say that
“we are pleased to have
been given the oppor-
tunity to shape our own
destiny”, but that “any
relocation of services...
would involve consulta-
tion with many groups,
including patients, staff,
referrers, commissioners,
and other key stakehold-
ers”.
While the Royal Bro-
mpton will remain open, a
number of centres across
the country – including
A
number of
chemistry labs
have been
t e m p o r a r i l y
shut down this week fol-
lowing safety concerns.
Four labs in the RCS1
building were closed last
Chemistry labs closed following health and safety
concerns
Friday, after a fire audit
organised by the Depart-
ment of Chemistry, and
carried out by external
consultants, raised con-
cerns over procedures
for chemical storage and
general housekeeping.
The Head of Chemistry,
Professor Alan Arm-
strong, made the decision
to temporarily close the
labs “so those working
there could carry out
housekeeping activities,
such as the removal of
waste”, a College repre-
sentative told Felix.
Sources tell Felix
that the research groups
affected are working with
the College and Faculty of
Natural Sciences to ensure
that the labs comply with
safety policy.
A number of students
have been affected by
the closure, which will
continue until safety com-
pliance is achieved.
In a statement, a
College representative
told Felix “Disruption
caused by the temporary
closure of the labs will be
taken into account when
assessing student projects.
Those working in the labs
have been reminded of the
need to comply with the
highest safety standards at
all times.”
Two of the labs have
since been reopened, and
the College say that “the
others are expected to
follow soon.”
The RCS1 Building,
which is located next to
the SirAlexander Fleming
Building, houses lab
groups in the Department
of Biology, Biochemistry,
and Chemistry.

Imperial College Health-
care NHS Trust – will no
longer offer certain CHD
They went on to
say: “Our thoughts as a
medical academic society,
however, lie with the
current and prospective
patients. We are glad
that a solution has been
reached that benefits them
overall whilst continuing
to provide their future
doctors with exceptional
training and a solid evi-
dence-base."
The Royal College of
Surgeons, in a joint state-
ment with the Society for
Cardiothoracic Surgery,
said they supported raising
standards, but “these
changes should have hap-
pened decades ago”, and
the “endless delays” have
caused “great uncertainty
to all the hospitals in-
volved, their staff, and the
children they care for.”
Plans to end CHD
services at the Royal
Brompton were fiercely
opposed by the hospital,
whose representatives
claimed that it would
cost the trust £47 million
– 13% of their income
– a figure NHS England
disputed. The Royal Bro-
mpton also argued that
cessation of CHD services
would have a knock-on
effect on other services
they could provide, such
as paediatric respiratory
medicine.
The Royal Brompton
Hospital is one of the
best known centres in
the world for cardiology
and respiratory medicine.
It was responsible for
the UK’s first combined
heart and lung transplant,
and is closely linked with
Imperial’s National Heart
and Lung Institute, one
of the largest respiratory
departments in the world.
The proposals were strongly criticised by several Imperial academics, including Lord Darzi // Imperial

Lisa-Jayne Edwards
and Chris Eichhorn, pres-
idents of ICSM Heart, a
student society for those
interested in cardiology,
said they were “very
pleased” by the decision.
“The Royal Brompton
Hospital, especially, is a
centre of interest, study,
and inspiration for our
members who aspire to
be cardiologists, cardiac
surgeons, and cardiovas-
cular scientists,” they told
Felix, “This decision will
certainly affect students’
exposure to the narrow
field of congenital cardi-
ology.”

Felix does ACC...
T
his week some-
thing rather
remarkable has
happened: the
Felix Editor is writing his
editorial before noon on a
Thursday, rather than an
hour before the print dead-
line. It’s unprecedented.
I could lie, and say that
this is because I’m being
super organised, but you
and I both know that’s
not the case. What really
happened was that last
night Felix did ACC, and
I am now too hungover
to write anything other
than a sentimental
barrage of my thoughts
and #feelings. This was
my first ACC night since
coming to Imperial, more
than five years ago, a fact
that shocked many of
the editorial team. I was
always under the impres-
sion that it was like sports
night on steroids, and that
anyone who wasn’t on
the football team would
get forced to down pints
by pituitary cases painted
blue. Was this the case?
Maybe. Who knows. I
really can’t remember that
much, other than attempt-
ing to do a strawpedo and
being hit with that barrage
of warm, sweaty air you
encounter when you first
enter Metric. I also have
a distinct recollection of
someone asking me what
sports team I was on; I
think I said ‘yoga’.
But after a few hours
of incredibly poor quality
sleep, I’m back in the
office, trying to get this
week’s paper to print. As
I write this, NHS England
have just announced that
the Royal Brompton
Hospital will be keeping
its congenital heart disease
services open – long-ges-
tating proposals relating
to quality of care for cardi-
ology patients would have
led to the services being
scrapped, which would
have had a knock-on
effect on their other units.
The Royal Brompton is a
world-famous centre for
respiratory medicine and
cardiology, and closure
of these units would have
made this a thing of the
past.
At Imperial, people are
often accused of being
apolitical. We’re told that
we don’t care enough
about the world around
us, that we’re too busy
focussing on lab reports
and SCR breakfasts
to get upset about rent
strikes or living wage
campaigns. But while it’s
true that most people here
are working very hard,
developments around the
Royal Brompton highlight
why it’s so important for
us to stay tuned in to
what’s going on. Science
isn’t divorced from the
world – it’s a field that is
intensely political, hugely
contingent on decisions
made in Westminster and
beyond. Lack of funding
for the NHS will have
a knock-on impact on
the amount of research
being done; Brexit has
already led to academics
leaving Imperial for less
Eurosceptic shores; and
what you’re supposed to
be learning in that aero
lecture you’re not paying
attention to could have a
real impact on the world
in the future.
So we should all engage
with the political sphere,
and this starts with edu-
cation: find out about the
issues that will affect you;
learn the names of your
local councillors; head
along to some meetings.
Science has got to be
political – it can’t afford
not to be.
