T
he vice-chan-
cellor of Bath
University will
step down at
the end of the academic
year following concerns
over her pay, but will
continue to collect her
salary until 2019.

vice-chancellor in the

a year, compared to a

I
mperial staff from
the EU have begun
leaving following
last year’s Brexit
referendum.
Speaking to the
Evening Standard, Im-
perial president Alice
Gast said she was “very
concerned” about the
uncertainties surrounding
Brexit negotiations,
which have caused some
Imperial staff to return to
their home countries in the
EU. Half of the remaining
staff have attended pres-
entations about free legal
support with around 220
EU Imperial staff leaving following Brexit decision
people attending one-to-
one advice sessions.
However, she added:
“We are still attracting
talent because we are a
great and very interna-
tional university and we
intend to stay that way,”
citing the recruitment
of Professor Francisco
Veloso as dean of Imperial
College Business School,
and Professor Simone
Buitendijk as Vice Provost
(Education).
Despite the challenges
ahead, Professor Gast
remains hopeful about
Imperial’s future in
post-Brexit Britain.
“I am optimistic that
the value of the higher
education community is
understood both in Europe
and the UK and that will
be a motivation to nego-
tiate good solutions to
Brexit to maintain those
collaborations [with EU
member states]. We just
have to find the right way
to get there,” she said.
“We need to address the
challenges of talent mo-
bility. It will come down
to good immigration pol-
icies that will enable us to
bring in talented people,”
she added.
be conducted.
“We intend to remain
the most international in-
stitution. We do not want
border issues to jeopard-
ize this situation. If there
are border controls, we
will commit to always
collaborating with people
of talent.” she continued.
Professor Gast said
research funded by the
EU had been of “great
value” to Imperial and
that it is essential these
collaborations continue.
In October last year, Pro-
fessor Gast announced a
European Partners Fund
worth £100,000 a year to
“develop collaborations
in Europe which lead
to new science and to
applications for external
funding.”
One quarter of Imperial
staff and one fifth of its
students come from the
EU. Their rights and
protections while living
in the UK after Brexit are
still uncertain. Although
progress is understood to
have been made on the
Divorce Bill and Irish
border, Britain’s offers
regarding the rights of
EU citizens living in the
UK post-Brexit have
repeatedly been rejected
by the EU as not going far
enough.
of around £250,000-
£280,000. She has been
at the centre of a contro-
versial row over the past
few months surrounding
the “exceptional” salaries
paid to vice-chancellors.
After facing increasing
pressure from students
and academics at Bath
University, Dame Glynis
will finish her tenure as
vice-chancellor on the
31st of November 2018.
She will then take a six
month sabbatical, thus
continuing to receive her
full salary until February
2019. The university
is also writing off her
interest-free £31,000 car
loan, which staff claim
was a benefit in kind
rather than a loan. On top
of this, Dame Glynis re-
ceives £8,738 a year for a
housekeeper to look after
her Georgian townhouse
(another benefit in kind
that cost £1.6 million) and
has claimed thousands
of pounds in expenses,
including £2 for biscuits.
Earlier this year, Labour
peer and former education
minister Lord (Andrew)
Adonis said when all her
assets were considered,
Dame Glynis “is paid
almost exactly half a
million pounds – more
than three times the prime
minister’s salary”.
Although many other
vice-chancellors receive
exceptionally high salaries
– Imperial President Alice
Gast takes home £430,000
a year – attentions have
focused on Dame Glynis
and Bath University due
to their poor handling of
the situation.
Until October, Dame
Glynis – like many
vice-chancellors – sat on
the remuneration commit-
tee responsible for setting
her salary. In the past aca-
demic year, Dame Glynis
received a 3.9% pay rise,
worth more than £17,500.
The majority of Bath
University employees re-
ceived pay rises of around
A motion to censure the
remunerations committee
was tabled at a university
council meeting in Feb-
ruary. Dame Glynis and
other committee members
were allowed to vote and
the motion was defeated
by 33 votes to 30.
Complaints prompted
an investigation by
the Higher Education
Funding Council for
England. It made 13
recommendations, stating
that the remuneration
committee needed to be
“much more transparent,
with significantly greater
explanation of its process-
es and decisions, both to
council and more widely”.
Dame Glynis narrowly
won a vote of no confi-
dence last week, scraping
victory by 19 votes to
16, with two abstentions.
Dame Glynis has claimed
this to be an endorsement
of her leadership. She has
also defended her salary,
saying: “I don’t think
that it’s unreasonable for
people with an enormous
amount of experience and
a proven track record to
be rewarded in the way
they are.” Although Bath
University has made great
progress under Dame
Glynis’ chancellorship,
applications to the univer-
sity have dropped while
its six main rivals have all
received increased admis-
sions applications.
Earlier this year,
universities minister Jo
Johnson set out plans
that would force univer-
sities to publish details of
staff earning more than
£100,00 a year and justify
salaries of over £150,000
to a new regulatory body,
the Office for Students.

The Drone Bill will
introduce new
measures to improve
safety.
Joanna Wormald
Deputy Editor
A
crackdown on
drones will
come into
force next year
following repeated near
misses with aircraft.
The draft Drone Bill,
due to be published in
spring, will require drone
operators to register a
flight plan via an app,
which will determine if
the drone can be used
“safely and legally”.
Police will also have the
power to ground drones
or seize them as evidence
when criminal charges are
brought. The government
is also considering a ban
on drone flights above
400 ft (already in place
for drones weighing more
than 7 kg) and using
‘geo-fences’ to create

mperial has
climbed two places
in the Times Higher
Education (THE)
university rankings by
their provisions for
physical sciences.
The league tables,
which were released
earlier this week, place
Imperial at 9th
in the world
for physical sciences – a
Imperial climbs in physical science rankings
category THE equates to
mathematics, physics,
chemistry, and geology
and earth sciences. Impe-
rial’s ranking is two places
up from 2017, and seven
places up from 2016.
The rankings place
Imperial 3rd
best in the
country, behind the Uni-
versities of Cambridge
and Oxford, which
achieved global ranks of
5th
and 6th
respectively,
within a top 20 dominated
by American higher edu-
cation providers.
The rankings are based
on metrics, including ci-
tations, industry income,
teaching, and research.
Imperial showed an in-
crease across all metrics,
most significantly in
international outlook and
citations.
The rankings provide
a contrast with a number
of other subject-based
league tables, which high-
lighted issues with student
satisfaction. The most
striking of these were
the Guardian University
League Tables, which
placed Imperial 18th
in the
country for Chemistry,
and 30th
for Physics. For
physics, this was a sharp
drop from the previous
year’s rankings, in which
they placed 8th
.
This year physics also
experienced a small drop
in the Complete Universi-
ty Guide’s rankings, from
3rd
to 5th
.
This discrepancy might
be explained by the meth-
odology of the league
tables: while the Guardian
league tables take student
satisfaction into account,
the THE league tables
do not – their score for
‘teaching’ is largely based
off a survey sent out ex-
clusively to academics.
In the Complete Uni-
versity Guide’s rankings,
Imperial came bottom of
all universities for physics
in terms of student
satisfaction.
Earlier this year, stu-
dents in the Departments
of Physics and Chemistry
reported poor satisfaction
rates in the annual Nation-
al Student Survey (NSS),
placing last and second-
to-last in rankings of
departments at Imperial.
Physics did particularly
poorly, with only 67% of
students feeling satisfied
with their course, and
issues with feedback and
marking highlighted.
Overall, the rankings
are dominated with Amer-
ican universities, with 115
institutions in the top 500.
Australia and China have
climbed the rankings,
with 23 entries each.
Elsewhere, however,
institutions in Germany,
South Korea, and Canada
have slipped down the
rankings.
THE takes into account
13 performance indicators
across five categories –
the same system used for
its overall world rankings.
However, while the world
rankings place a higher
emphasis on teaching and
research, the scores for
physical sciences are more
focussed on the number
of citations an institution
receives.
airports and other restrict-
ed areas.
Peter Zheng, a PhD
student in Imperial’s
Aerial Robotics Lab told
Felix: “This new focus on
geo-fencing really does
help enthusiasts keep
themselves safe, and keep
other people safe.
“For researchers, it’s
really good to develop
geo-fencing technology
and guidelines. This will
help us be aware of where
we can safely test our
technology; being aware
of this helps us to be safe.”
Thegovernmentalsore-
cently announced plans to
create a registry of owners
of drones weighing more
than 250g. These opera-
tors will also be required
to take safety awareness
tests. A collision with
a drone weighing 400g
would be sufficient to crit-
ically damage a helicopter
windscreen and a 2 kg
drone could have the same
effect on airliners.
“This law comes in
at a good time, when
the UK is just starting to
explore commercial uses
of drones,” Zheng said.
“All of the developments
around the safety of
drones allow the public
to be more engaged with
this community [of drone
users]. That’s also good
for researchers: there
will be more exposure
and people will be more
inclined to use the tech-
nology.”
The rising popularity
of drones over recent
years has caused the
number of near misses
to double, with multiple
incidents occurring each
week. Current regulations
require drone operators to
maintain “direct unaided
visual contact” with their
drones in order to prevent
collisions. Between
January and August 2017,
the Civil Aviation Au-
thority’s Airprox Board
investigated more than 60
incidents between drones
and other aircraft.
A large drone passed
an Airbus A319 as it was
landing at Gatwick. The
incident report said: “A
larger aircraft might not
have missed it and in the
captain’s opinion it had
put 130 lives at risk.”
It is not just recrea-
tional drones that face
problems. In September
the British Army lost two
reconnaissance drones
that crashed into the Irish
Sea. The drones were
part of the Watchkeeper
programme. In 2005, the
UK ordered 54 drones at
a cost of £847 million to
provide surveillance for
troops. The programme
was due to begin in 2010
but following numerous
setbacks, the drones have
only had a brief deploy-
ment in Afghanistan. A
report in July 2017 by
the UK Infrastructure
and Projects Authority
stated the Watchkeeper
programme had so far cost
£1.1 billion.
