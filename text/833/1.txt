the ER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
Exams are on!
Imperial College Union is to hold an
Extraordinary General Meeting next
Tuesday to discuss a motion i n
support of the aims of the
Association of University Teachers'
(AUT) recent decision to go ahead
with examinations whilst refusing to
mark them.
The motion o n A U T action,
proposed by I C U President Nigel
Baker comes i n the wake of the
A U T ' s recent rejection of a 6% pay
offer made to them b y the
Committee of Vice Chancellors and
Principals ( C V C P ) . T h e A U T
describes its switch from total exam
boycott to non-marking as 'a period
of grace for negotiations to proceed
w i t h o u t irretrievable loss of
examinations.' Their employers'
pay negotiators, the C V C P has
withdrawn from formal talks and
now refuses to take the dispute to
independent arbitration.
M r Baker's motion, calls for a
recognition of the AUT's new policy
on setting and marking of exams
and the C V C P ' s withdrawal from
negotiations. It claims that the
C V C P ' s action 'now represents the
greatest threat to this year's
examination process,' and 'can only
be to the deteriment of the future of
higher education.' The motion
instructs M r Baker to write to the
leaders of the A U T and the C V C P
to indicate IC Union's new stance
against the C V C P and to express its
fears for the future of higher
eduaction. In addition the motion
instructs IC Union Officers 'to
support the A U T in the aims of the
action, though not the means and
to condemn the C V C P for its policy
of non-negotiation.' M r Baker
summed up the motion, saying 'We
need to start pressure on the C V C P
now rather than the A U T to actually
getthis thing resolved.'
IC A L T President, Susan Parry
said she was 'very pleased' by the
motion and added that with the new
action they now felt they had their
membership fully behind t h e m .
The effects of the A U T ' s change
in policy are already evident in the
Civil Engineering department,
where a previously boycotted
examination is to be held at 8 days
notice next week. M r Baker told
FELIX that he intends to gain the
Rector's assurance that students will
be given 3 weeks notice for
retimetabled examinations in the
future.
Five members of Imperial College's
Christian Union were amongst
those trapped in the Alton Towers
sky lift disaster on G o o d Friday.
The students were trapped for an
hour when their carriage was blown
into a supporting pillar bringing the
whole ride to a halt.
'We could see it coming but there
was nothing we could d o ' said
Athos Ritsperis.
The students were eventually
rescued by the Fire Brigade.

y Hicks takes early retirement
The Union Bookshop manager, Roy
Hicks, has taken early retirement
following investigations into the
bookshops' £T6k trading deficit last
term. The running of the bookshop
has now been taken over by Union
Manager, Dave Peacock.
M r Peacock commented, ' M r
Hicks resignation highlights the
enormous stresses associated with
being the manager of a trading
outlet these days.'
The deficit came to light i n
December, w h e n the U n i o n
received audited profit and loss
accounts from the College. Auditors
were .called in to investigate the
reasons for the losses and in March
presented a report recommending
improved security, rationalisation of
personel and financial proceedures,
tighter stock and sales controls and
the introduction of Electronic Point
of Sales (EPOS) equipment.
The i n t r o d u c t i o n of E P O S
equipment and a possible refit of the
shop are under consideration bv the
U n i o n , b u t a number of
improvements including more
reliable cashing proceedures and
signing staff on and off tills have
been introduced since M r Hicks'
retirement.
Much of the deficit has arisen
because of the large stock levels held
within the bookshop, particularly
books recommended by lecturers,
w h i c h prove u n p o p u l a r w i t h
students.
Mr Peacock told FELiX that he is
currently trying to reduce the stock
levels by selling offt books at half
price a n d returning unpopular
books bought on 'sale or return.'
The Union are considering plans
to restrict the bookshop's stock to
popular academic texts and to use
the extra space generated for the
sale of greetings cards, toiletries and
electrical goods.
'If any students or staff have ideas
on which products we should stock
let us know in writing', said M r
Peacock.
The Union was given full control
of the bookshop Committee in July
1988. The profits from the shop are
distributed between Imperial
College Union and the Consituent
College Unions with an annual rent
of £4000 being paid to the College.
