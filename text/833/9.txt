the table who wants to be a pop star
or in the music business. They can't
handle that—they wanna lock you
away.
Sid: They think you're really rich or
something.
Lee: A l l this enterprise allowance
stuff is a load of shit. They just don't
cater for any kind of musical
scheme. The only people getting it
are starting food shops and stuff like
that.
You're on Lazy Records at the moment.
You haven't even got the EP out yet,
hut 1 hear i/ou've had offers from major
labels. Are you taking any up?
No, not at the moment. We're just
taking our time. We wanna produce
our own sound and get across on an
indie as a stepping stone. Use that
to get across to the major. Take our
music to a wider audience. Not for
anv real monev reasons.
/ didn't think your recording of Hollow
Heart sounded as powerful as you sound
live. Are you pleased xvith the way it
sounds?
Yeah, we're pleased. It's always a
problem to get the energy over in
the studio.
Lee: We went through quite a few
re-mixes 'cos the first one sounded
quite wimpy. I think it sounds quite
powerful.
Kale: We actually did it live in the
studio.
Lee: If you listen to the twelve inch
all the three tracks are strung
together. There's Hollow Heart, that
goes into Crystal then there's Gotta
Get Away. I think it's quite original
the way they all go into each other.
It sounds quite good. O n the seven
inch it's just Hollow Heart. As it goes
on it gets louder and louder—the
guitars get shoved up.
You're playing at Dingwalls tonight. Do
you think it's going to be a good gig?
Kale: Whatever happens, happens.
We can't really say. Something
might go wrong, and something
might go right. You'll have to wait
and see.
So playing live is the best bit for you?
Live is the best bit. It's brilliant. If
we could arrive, play, go home,
watch the telly and have a cup of tea
we'd probably be really happy
people. I'm glad we don't do that,
because we're not generally happy
people—we c a n be h a p p y
b u t . . . w e ' r e h a p p y between
ourselves.
The Birdland EP is out and molten,
coming close (but obviously not
right there) to their live
spontaneous explosion. Check it
out, if you want to hear one of this
year's truly exciting releases.

Some Christians assume that it is
their moral duty to be Socialist,
however I intend to show that
Socialism and Christianity are
incompatible. 1 shall start with the
Welfare State—a system which
causes many to think Socialism is
more Christian than Toryism.
What should be the Christian
attitude towards government and
the Welfare State? Should we
translate Christ's concern for the
poor into government care for the
homeless? We should remember
what Christ said. In all his teaching
he always calls on us as individuals
to personally take responsibility for
the problems we see: he never
asked for action from the state. We
are all called to give to the poor, feed
the h u n g r y a n d shelter the
homeless. This is not the job of a
collective state.
We should consider the effect the
Welfare State has on individuals.
Manv see government programmes
as a replacement for charitv work by
volunteers, but as Christians we
should realise how dangerous this
concept is. If the government is
responsible for the needy what is
the role of the Christian? Some
complacently fall into the attitude
that we don't need to do more
ourselves: It's u p to the
government.' This reliance o n
government c a n cause the
individual to isolate himself from
the problems of the poor.
For example, in the earlier Church
it was traditional to give 10% of vour
income to charitv. but this tradition
has faded out. Many Christians feel
government has replaced their need
to give, including a Baptist minister
I know, who said of the 10% 'people
pay more than that in taxes.' Surely
we should not wash our hands of
the problems of others simply
because government is trying to
help them as well. However, when
the state intervenes in a situation
there is a tendency to forget about
our continuing responsibility.
As Christians we encourage
participation in community projects
as they foster a caring community
attitude. But any government
programme tends to create apathy
rather than the positive outgoing
feeling that comes from the work of
individuals. For this reason we must
trv to avoid government
intervention in welfare and should,
instead, promote personal
benevolence.
Though some Christians call for
increased government welfare
(believing it is their moral duty), it
creates an apathetic culture in which
people feel they are only responsible
for themselves. If the devil was to
choose what sort of society he
wanted, this is just what he would
choose! It is ironic that some
Christians are doing the devil's
work for him.
To encourage government
intervention i n welfare after
realising its effect is irresponsible,
and saying it is necessary to
eliminate poverty is only a 'the end
justifies the means' argument. A n y
work done by government can be
done by a charity; this is what
Christians should be promoting. For
a Christian the question is not
whether the disadvantaged should
be cared for, but how it should be
done.
At first glance Socialism a n d
Christianity might have seemed
very compatible as both call for the
power and money of the rich to be
given to the poor. However,
Socialism alwavs translates this aim
into government enforced schemes,
not the voluntary giving Christ asks
for. A s I have said, such
government schemes form a self-
centred, apathetic society, and as
such schemes are art intrinsic part
of Socialism, the Christian has no
choice but to denounce Socialism as
the work of Satan.
Toryism (at first glance) might
seem self-centred, but this is only a
popular misconception—this is not
what Toryism is really about; the
Tory party is the party of Active
Citizenship. We believe it is better
to have a job done by willing
individuals than to have it done by
mercenary bureaucrats w h o may
not personally care about the job
they are doing. The purpose of
reducing taxation and government
is to both alert individuals to their
responsibility and to enable them to
pursue it by letting them choose to
use their money to help others.
It is true that the generous
economic situation under the Tories
is abused by some self-centred
Yuppies, but this is not o u r
intention. We have no need of such
people. The scale of such abuse is
only due to the false philosophy
(caused by the present existence of
the Welfare State) that 'what the
government doesn't take is mine.'
The removal of the Welfare State
will send a clear message to all that
they should personally give to
charity. The removal of the Welfare
State will have to be gradual and in
phases, but it must be done.
The aim of the Tory Party is to
create a society of Active Citizens,
in which people care for each other
instead of leaving it to the
government. Surely this is exactly
what Christians are striving for.
The views expressed are the
author's and not necessarily those
of I C Conservative Society or I C
Christian Union.
