Obituary
The death of Peter Churchill in a
road accident near Bristol on April
2nd, deprives many of a good
friend.
Peter, 22, graduated from
M e c h a n i c a l E n g i n e e r i n g last
summer and had been working for
Rolls Royce at their Bristol aero
engine plant.
During his four years at Imperial,
Peter was an active member of the
Sporting Motorcycle Club a n d
Motor Club. H e continued his
involvement despite moving away
from London and often returned for
events.
Peter's enthusiasm for life, his
cheery disposition and his wicked
sense of humour will be greatly
missed by all his friends and
colleagues.

Angry
Student Unions are angry with the
National U n i o n of Students (NUS)
decision to hold an anti-loans
demonstration o n the May Day
bank holiday and to merge the
march with a demonstration by the
Trade Union Congress T U C ) .
The Unions are unhappy because
the N U S Executive were mandated
to hold the demonstration mid-
week during term-time by the N U S
Easter conference.
Ruth Benzimera , U L U acting
president, has written to N U S
president ( M a e v e Sherlock)
condemning the N U S attitude,
following the U L U presidents'
meeting held on Monday. The U L U
exec has decided not to publicise the
demonstration, and to advertise it
as a trade union demonstration.
I C U President N i g e l Baker
commented ' A l l the N U S colleges
are up i n arms' and 'It just totally
sums u p the N U S exec's attitude to
it's membership'. U L U has now
decided to build for a demonstration
in the A u t u m n term, a n d may
employ a professional lobbyist to try
and prevent the white paper from
being put in the Queen's Speech in
November.
A dinosaur caught terrorising tourists in the Natural
History Museum - a publicity stunt to publicise the
museums exhibition of robotic dinosaurs.
Imperial goes green
The College hope to save £15,000
each year in a waste paper recycling
scheme for the Sherfield Building.
If successful the scheme will be
extended to cover the rest of the
College.
The College hope to collect 200
tonnes of office and computer paper
a year by placing special paper bins
in each office. The bins will be
emptied b y cleaning staff a n d
collected by Friends of the Earth,
who will sell the paper to a
merchant.
Most of the College's savings will
result from reduced waste disposal
costs. Currently the College spends
£50,000 on removing waste, 20% of
which is due to waste paper.
The scheme was set up following
a favourable feasibility study carried
out over the Summer by Imperial
College U n i o n w i t h financial
assistance from Friends of the Earth.
Union building theft
Three men escaped with the Union
video recorder, a handbag and an
estimated £150 i n cash from the
Union games room i n a series of
thefts over Easter.
The men used crowbars and bolt
cutters to break into cash boxes in
four machines in the games room on
April 5th. College Security also
believe that the same men were
responsible for taking a handbag
from the Life Sciences Department
earlier in the day, and the Social
Clubs Committee video recorder
which had been left unattended in
the Union Building.
Keys from the stolen handbag
were later found in the games room
whilst the rest of the bag's contents
were found in the cystern of one of
the gents' toilets.
The m e n were discovered
breaking into the games machines
on the following night by Union Bar
Manager Adrian Johnson. The men
escaped before M r Johnson could
contact security guards.
The men were again spotted in
Beit Quad on April 7th and hatfe
been seen loitering in the Chemical
Engineering Department.
Two of the men are described as
5ft 6 inches tall and dark skinned.
The third man is blond and six feet
tall. A l l three men are in their
mid-20s
Police are currently investigating
the thefts a n d have taken
fingerprints from machines in the

unsure how the thieves gained
access to the club itself.

Reeves.
