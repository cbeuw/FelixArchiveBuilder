FELIX
Editorial
A U T
The Association of University Teachers (AUT) have backed
down in their decision not to set examination papers. Final
year students worried about having to re-sit another year
can now breath a sigh of relief.
It now falls upon the Student Unions to lend their full
support to the AUT's claim.
Despite what the Committee of Vice Chancelors and
Principals (CVCP) would have us believe, the dispute has
nothing to do with greedy academics demanding money
which is not theirs to be had. It has everything to do with
academics being paid a decent salary for the work they
carry out.
But the implications behind the dispute are much deeper.
If the British Universities refuse to pay academics a
reasonable salary they should not expect to attract the high
quality people that Britain needs to maintain education
standards. In the end, it is education which will suffer.
Imperial College Union will be holding an Emergency
General Meeting on Tuesday to discuss the latest
developments in the AUT dispute and I urge you to attend.
The Union will be proposing a motion which calls for
pressure to be applied to the CVCP to reconsider the AUT's
pay claim. It is a motion that we would be foolish to ignore.
Clubs and Sports
I would like to see the Clubs and Sports pages expanded
this term. Unfortunately I cannot do this unless social and
sports clubs are willing to submit articles.
I believe that a couple of clubs have had problems with
articles being cut because of lack of space. Hopefully, if
we receive enough articles, I will be able to allocate an extra
page to clubs and sport and lack of space will cease to be
a problem.
If anyone is interested in editing or proofing clubs or
sports articles they should get in touch. Film is available
from the FELIX office free of charge for any sporting clubs
willing to take photographs at Harlington.
FELIX
Unfortunately because I have had to attend interviews this
week this edition of FELIX is a little thinner than I would
have liked. There will be a more robust FELIX next week.
Articles, gossip and information gratefully received.
