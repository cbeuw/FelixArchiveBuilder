Music
When did you last see a band who
scared you? The total
unpredictability of the situation
lending a more than even chance
that you, and those around you,
will in some way, become drawn
into the violence being perpetrated
just feet away on stage.
This is no act. When Lee launches
his guitar at Kale and connects with
a vengeance fifteen feet away—then
you know. When the front row
want to be gouged by vicious
Fenders—you know. When the road
crew come on and stare in disbelief
at the carnage and destruction—
then you know.
This interview was conducted
before the twenty minute
confrontation that was Birdland
destroying Dingwalls on March
13th. When Birdland speak, it's
often as one voice; and impossible
to keep track of who said what. For
the record though; Lee (guitar) and
Kale (bass) do a lot of the talking,
with Sid (drums) chipping in,
Robert (vocals) preferred to remain
detached and almost elsewhere,
with his brother Lee representing
both him and his songs.
I've heard you play live, hut I haven't
heard any material apart from Hollow
Heart on SNUB. How would you
describe your music?
B: H o w would you describe it Kale?
Sort of psychedelic punk. More
energetic.
Lee: Energetic. Sharp. Sharp,
pointed. Like when you get a brand
new pencil, and it's sharp, so sharp
you can poke anyone's eye out with
it. It's as sharp as that.
Kale: There's a lot of frustration in
it. You're fed up of these shit bands
who just stand there on stage and
play. There's no performance there.
We've got a lot of energy and that's
really good.
So when you^play is it all spontaneous,
or do you work anything out
beforehand?
Lee: N o . The only things we work
on is the songs and that's it. 'Cos
if we worked on any moves we did
on stage it'd look false. A n d we're
not false. Anything can happen in
the next half hour before we go on
stage and when we go on stage. It's
always like that.
Do you ever actually get to play a full
set or do you trash the instruments
before you even get through it?
N o . That is a full set, what we do.
Even when that means two songs?
B: Yeah, that can be' a full set. It
doesn't matter. It depends how we
feel on the night. If we feel like
doing a set with only two songs
then we do two songs. Most people
come along and they're complaining
afterwards that they've paid £3 or
whatever and they just want to see
a 40 minute show by a band, even
if the band are pissed off. We don't
wanna do that. Our heart's in it,
even if we play for seven minutes.
If people wanna see a fifty minute
rock show that's their fault you
know.
Have you got much of a following?
B: Yeah. But not a lot of that.
(Laughs.) You could say a following.
Every time we do a gig we get
twenty or thirty people afterwards
saying it was brilliant. So we're
building up something at the
moment, you know what I mean?
Lee: People are coming along and
just staring at us at the moment.
They dunno what to think, they
dunno what to do sort of thing. 'Cos
most people are just used to you
standing there and looking at the
floor and being dead boring. A n d
then when they see us and we're
energetic they just can't believe it.
So would you appreciate a bit more
audience participation?
Lee: That's O K if they want to do
that. We'll just hit them over the
head with a guitar if they want to
get on stage. We get paranoid that
they'll want to stab us. It's O K if
they're going mad down the front,
but not at the side. The stage is small
enough at the moment without
anyone else on.
You're getting really over the top
reviews. How do you feel about
comments like that, doesn't it give you
a lot to live up to?
It's not hype. We're getting a lot of
all this bullshit about hype. Hype
has got nothing to do with us—it's
just promotion. But I'm sure that in
six months people are going to turn
around and say shit. But that
doesn't matter to us.
Do you believe that you're that good?
Kale: Yeah. W e ' d be idiots if we
thought anything else, if we thought
we were crap. There'd be no point
being in a band. Thinking we're
crap doesn't even come into our
heads. That's why it's horrible
when bands think; 'we'll make it big
in the Indie scene, and that's all we
want to do'. We want to be massive.
What do you think you'd be doing if you
weren't in a band?
B: We'd be dead.
It sounds like you've got all your future
plans worked out, have you got
anything specific coming up?
Not really at the moment. It's just
to do what we want, to make
records in exactly the way we want,
no manipulation at all. We're so
arrogant we can't do it any other
way, we can't listen to anyone else.
You've mentioned a couple of current
bands, what are your favourite bands at
the moment?
Pixies, Sonic Youth. There's a lot of
things. House of-Love. Those are
the bands at the moment.
I haven't heard the EP yet, what can
we expect on that, what are the songs
about?
I think you'll be surprised. Yeah,
you'll be surprised. Hopefully you'll
like it.
Are the songs written about any specific
instances, or are they just blasts of
adrenalin?
Robert: I can't really say. You just
have to listen. Make your own mind
up about it.
I'm constantly reading about your
amazing on-stage energy. How do you
keep it up? Do you take any drugs?
No, no. It's just adrenalin, it's just
there. N o drugs. It's like people
saying we're being sick and stuff,
but before we go on we're drinking
orange juice. (Birdland are referring
to the infamous fane's Addiction
support slot, from which they were
thrown off after allegations of them
destroying equipment on stage
during their set and throwing up in
the dressing room before the gig.)
It's totally natural, there's no drugs
involved. If we took anything like
speed w e ' d probably blow up
anyway. We wouldn't be able to do
it if we took drugs, you've got to be
in control of what you're doing. It's
just natural adrenalin that we
siphon off.
What ivas the truth behind the Jane's
Addiction tour stories then?
It was bollocks that was. We trashed
a mike stand, and they reckoned we
were sick in the toilets. That's no
excuse to get kicked off the tour
anyway. We just blew them off,
nicked their audience and that was
it.
Lee: We just went down really well.
They were this big N e w York band
that were crap basically. Everyone
tried to put on their American
accents, they were really proud of
them. It was really false—fair
enough, if you come from America
you've gotta have an American
accent but they went too far.
When you 're on stage, and you 're being
pretty energetic do you ever smash stuff
that you latex wish you hadn't?
N o , never, 'cos if you regret things
like that you might as well pack up
there and then. It depends how we
feel on the night. Maybe we'll
decide not to do that. It's a feeling.
At the moment we're quite young,
arrogant and so frustrated with all
this shit around us that's what we
do it for.
Does if get expensive?
Yeah.
So what are you living on at the
moment?
Absolutely nothing.
We don't live.
Lee: They stopped us getting dole
the other week. That's why I've
been wearing this shirt for the last
three weeks. We're really poor at
the moment—we got chucked off
the dole. Trying to get back on the
dole you have to make up loads of
pathetic excuses, like you wanna be
a journalist or something. They
don't wanna know if you're in a
band. They can't believe that there's
someone sitting opposite them at
