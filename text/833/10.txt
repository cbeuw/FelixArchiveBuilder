IC CHOIR
Inspired Bach
Bach's St Matthew Passion is one of
the few pieces of his in which Bach
reallv lets rip his angst. Usually he
maintains a professional distance to
his music—as d i d all baroque
composers—producing masses of
inspired joy a n d melancholia
depending on what his employers
wanted. It is also packed with a lot
of the innovation for which Bach is
still popular.
This w a s a n a c c o m p l i s h e d
performance, and my admiration
goes to the soloists, to )ohn Rath for
carrying through the part of Christ
with suitable dignity, and to Susan
Kessler for simply having a very
pleasant voice. Considering the
length of the piece (two hours) and
the strain this can have on the vocal
chords, the C h o i r d i d very
commendably. I've never heard
such a terrifying 'Barabbas'.
This piece contains masses of
plain song with banal but important
accompaniment with the 'cello and
h a r p s i c h o r d , w h i c h c a n be
extremely tedious. It reflects on the
performers that it was not so.
In short a majestic and inspiring
rendition.
BOAT
Win Against
Surrey
The last weekend in January saw IC
gathering their finest talents for a
match against Surrey. The racing
went IC's way from the start. In the
first race Bill Chard shot off into the
distance and the rest of the team
followed making it a 1-2-3 for IC.
This result was repeated several
times and although Surrey pulled
one back after lunch, an exciting
climax saw Liam Moloney clinch the
match 4-1 to us by a foot.
A week later IC were looking for
another win but this time over City
University. The windy conditions
made going tough but this didn't
seem to bother the IC team. (One
member, Carol, preferred Hara-Kiri
to leaving the sanctuary of the bar).
Nevertheless the first two races
were easily won. If the afternoon
races were abandoned when all of
the City team capsized in the windy
conditions—making it 2-0 to IC and
vet another w i n .
FENCING
Foiled Again
The m e n came t h r o u g h the
challenge r o u n d against
Southampton last week, avenging
last year's defeat. The ladies put up
a fair fight but were unfortunately
knocked out by Reading (6-3).
This week Birmingham men came
to fence the quarter finals on our
slippery gym floor. Foil was first,
which Imperial impressively won
5-4, with both Gully Burns and Ian
Draper winning one bout each and
Pete Crip well all three. Then the
sabre, Simon Hoblen stylishly won
three bouts, Dave Matthews neatly
fought his way to one victory,
Simon Chenery fought valiantly too.
So the epee started at 9 all.
Here A d a m Sadler successfully
won a l l three, S i m o n Evans,
perfecting a three week old left-
handed style, won two bouts—
narrowly losing a third. Pete
C r i p w e l l trounced a l l three
opponents—as usual. So Imperial
were triumphant, winning 17-10
overall.
This means that the team will face
the mighty U C L team at
Southampton in the U A U semifinal
in a few weeks time.
SCI Fl
Up-To-Date
Welcome back after (we hope) a
happy Easter. The hardworking
committee have finished
redecorating the library a n d
cataloguing o u r books o n
computer—all we need now are the
books that people still have! If you
have any SF library books, please
bring them back. Our new library is
at the bottom of the stairs in the S W
corner of Beit Quad (diagonally
opposite from the Union Bar)—we'll
be open by 1pm on Thursdays.
Forthcoming attractions: The
ICSF Annual Dinner, provisional
date June 7th. Watch this space!
Friday night sees the last of the Ents
events this year. It promises to be
one of the best, if not the best,
Carnival so far.
Headlining is Buster Bloodvessel's
band Bad Manners. I'm sure they
need no introduction as everyone
must have heard songs such as
Special Brew. Lip Up Fatty and the
Can Can and apparently there is a
ska revival so I expect they are set
for fame again. W e also have
Butterfield 8 which includes 2 ex-
members of Madness and have
recently been supporting The James
Taylor Quartet, who played at the
last Carnival. Their music is a
mixture of swing and jazz played in
a very danceable way. The final
band p l a v i n g is a n e w i s h
Manchester band called Stop
• Laughing who are just about to sign
a major recording contract so
possibly a band to look out for.
We don't only have bands on
show, in the U D H we have some
great comedy. Top billing goes to
Chris Lynam but also features Pat
Condell and The Long and the Short of
it. The compere for the evening is
Malcolm Hardy. Not much to say
about this lot, why not come along
and judge for yourself? There will,
of course, be the great Ents Disco in
the Lounge, playing until vou drop.
A Casino will be run in the SCR
with lots of great prizes. The Union
Bar is open until 2am (Happy Hour
from 8-9pm) and if you like a
cocktail or two try the Crush Bar
outside the Concert Hall. As well as
burgers in the quad, there is the
usual free transport home for
women throughout the night.
Tickets are £3 in advance, £4 on
the door and £2 to Ents cardholders
available from Ian Morris in the
Union Office. Doors open at 8pm,
please get there early to ensure you
get in! Enjoy it!
