Her Alibi
Romanian student Nina Ionescu is
accused of murder. Lovestruck
writer Philip Blackwood is her alibi.
B l a c k w o o d , p l a y e d b y T o m
Selleck (Three Men and a Baby,
Magnum) first sees Nina i n court
whilst looking for a basis for his next.
Peter Swift mystery best-seller.
Telling the police they have been
lovers f o r some time, a n d
persuading the girl to move in with
him, Blackwood gets her off the
hook.
Police Lieutenant Frank Polito is
unhappy though, knowing the alibi
to be untrue, and whilst staking out
Blackwood's home he warns the
writer of hidden danger. 'If you
retract the story, she goes back to
jail. T h e only thing standing
between her and a murder charge
is your life.'
But B l a c k w o o d has a l l h e
requires—a blossoming romance
with a beautiful girl and one or two
mysterious happenings to provide
Peter Swift with a new adventure.
Until a string of accidents begins
and the uncertainty of his position
becomes all too apparent.
The often used device of narrative
talkover has been heard in movies
since the first dusky gumshoe flicks
right up to the present day, in the
likes of Bladerunner and of course
Magnum. T h e same trick is
employed in Her Alibi, with Selleck
'reading' the new Swift novel as the
events it portrays unfold on screen.
This done to great effect, since
Blackwood is blinded by love but
lost in caution and doubt, while his
alter-ego Peter Swift is the dashing,
sure-footed hero w h o takes
everything i n his stride. The
contrast between-Blackwood's life
and the parallel fantasy world he
inhabits on paper provides the basis
for the film's humour.
Selleck copes admirably with the
comedic requirements, as is to be
expected from his previous roles,
and although he himself sees the
character as very different, the
similarities to Thomas Magnum are
'Would Sir like something for the weekend?'
Measure for
Measure
The Young V i c
The storyline pivoting around role
reversals has been seen often i n
recent months in such films as Vice
Versa and Big and a host of others.
This overworked theme, seemingly
only out-cliched by 'Buddy movies'
has its roots deep in the past in, for
example, The Prince and the Pauper',
and earlier still i n Measure for
Measure, and even the Bible
Shakespeare though provides
more than just a n evening's
entertainment. Here he engages i n
some cutting political observation,
as the narrative parodies the new
King James. It also offers a lesson of
sorts to the puritanical audience,
paralleling good cold cash with good
hot sex, to show that in love and
commerce the value of what we
possess depends on how we spend
it.
Enough of the literature lesson,
here's the plot: Duke Vincentio,
ruler of Vienna, leaves town for a
while and puts power in Angelo's
lap. He in turn invokes strict laws
and pulls d o w n the brothels.
Shame. But worse still he imprisons
Claudio, and sentences h i m to
death, for getting his girlfriend in
the club. By chance Claudio has a
soul-mate in Lucio who searches out
help in the form of Claudio's sister
Isabella. She, being the black sheep
of the family, is about to become a
nun. She postpones her vows to
plead with Angelo.
Angelo is adamant, but offers
Claudio's life i n exchange for
Isabella's virginity. Boys will be
boys. In doing so, he is as guilty as
Claudio himself, at least in mind if
not body.
Meanwhile, the Duke is parading
around in a robe, learning all this
under the guise of a friar. He comes
up with a clever plan to save
transparent and the movie gains
from this.
His leading lady is Paulina
Porizkova, a Czech, and currently
the world's highest paid model, and
no wonder; she has the looks to
capture the undivided attention of
any male audience. She can act
pretty well too, and makes short
work of endowing her character
with flair and panache, whilst
retaining the element of mystery
which confuses Blackwood so
much. 'Do any of us ever really
know the person we fall i n love
with?', he writes.
The pairing is wonderful, and the
two are supported by a fairly strong
cast and a decent plot. The humour
comes thick and fast, and the release
date of May 12th makes Her Alibi an
ideal way of breaking the stress of
exams.

Claudio, entrap Angelo and, with a
bit of luck, win the admiration and
hand of Isabella.
What opens as a tragedy, with
Claudio's death a dead cert, swings
between happy and sad endings as
Shakespeare invents new characters
to help himself out of tight corners.
Along the way there are a few
comedic set pieces, chiefly involving
Pompey, a mix of AI Capone and
Arthur Daley, and wide boy Lucio.
The text, while not the simplest of
the Bard's works is nevertheless
accessible.
The performances are good too, in
particular Rob Edward's detached,
yet observant, Duke and Stephen
Jenn's stubbornly confused Angela.
They are both out-shone by Dominic
Letts, a flamboyant and swaggering
Lucio.
The Young V i c provides an
informal, relaxed fringe setting,
while retaining an intensity and
closeness strongly advantageous to
any lengthy performance. A n d it
offers concessions for students too,
so it can't be bad.

Metropolis
Down at the Piccadilly Theatre, just
off the Circus, London's newest
musical has recently opened. Taking
Fritz Lang's 1927 futurist vision
from the silver screen to the stage
is an ambitious project considering
the scale of the original.
Metropolis is, i n essence, a love
story set against a backdrop of
servile oppression. A cast of over
37,000 and a cost of seven million
Marks gave the movie a spectacular
appearance. M i c h a e l W h i t e ' s
production captures a little of this
though ultimately the small stage
enforces a n i n s u r m o u n t a b l e
limitation. The cast numbers 40, but
the cost remains a comparable £ 3
million. It's all yours for a mere
£8.50 on student standby.
The curtain opens to an incredible
set of pipes, gantries, valves and
wheels which make u p the Pater
Noster machine. Populating this are
the workers, busying themselves en
masse in a scene reminiscent of the
white mice from 'Bagpuss' whilst
chanting the opening number
'101.11' with gusto. A blast of
triumphant dynamism.
The people are unhappy, and led
by Maria (Judy Kuhn), about to
embark on a little worthwhile
anarchy. High above, the city is
ruled by Freeman (Brian Blessed),
controlling everything from a huge
bubble which swings impressively
from the skies. His estranged son
Steven (Graham Bickley) heads off
to the underworld for a look-see and
falls in love with Maria.
Changing places with a worker,
