Italian Delights
The columnist recently returned from a two week gastronomic tour of
Lombardy, Emilia and Venato. In a four part series of articles he will take
us through the experience of cuisine familiale in a Milan kitchen, the food
that makes Emilia-Romagna world famous, an evening with an experienced
Bolognese cook and the joy of eating with the Veneti. This series was only
possible due to the assistance afforded by Luca Zullo and Elena Donvito.
Part 1
Bologna—II culto del bene essere
(the way of happy living)
I find that every year I pass through
a stage where I feel that the food
that 1 serve has lost its sparkle. The
new ideas pruned from different
parts of the world and learned from
watching friends cook have been
taken on board and integrated. This
is the time to go abroad to allow the
ingredients, aromas and colours of
unfamiliar cuisine to inspire one to
diversify one's culinary repertoire.
There could not be a better way
to start than to go to Emilia-
Romagna. The cuisine of this region
of Italy came to the forefront
because it dominated the cuisine
described in Pellegrino Artusi's La
Scienza in Cucina e VArte di Mangiare
Bene (1891). (Culinary science and
the art of eating well.) Bologna in
particular established a reputation as
a gastronomic centre of Italy. I
discovered that the people of this
region have an insatiable capacity to
talk about food and to consume it
in gluttonous proportions.
On a student budget it was not
possible to eat out at any of the
region's restaurants recommended
by James Johnson in the Sunday
Times' classic nine-part series titled
the Taste of Italy. A friend in Bologna
recommended the Trattoria Casa
delle A i e (Via delle A i e 4,
0544-927631) at Cervia on the
Adriatic coast. The trattoria is
housed in an 18th century house
that is run by the Ministry of Fine
Arts. As the government is involved
you can be sure to get a good deal.
The local dishes, the local wines and
the home made Romagnol bread
can all be sampled. A full meal will
cost you about £11 per head—a
paltry sum to pay for fine art. Do not
miss the opportunity to eat here if
you are in the area.
With my pocket full of petty cash
I consigned myself to walking the
shady porticos of Bologna and
seeing the produce that has made
Emilia-Romagna world famous.
Prosciutto di Parma (Parma Hams),
hams branded with the crown of
Parma are salted, dried and matured
over a period of a year to yield a
cured meat that has a lovely pink
colour, a light aroma and a taste that
is only slightly salty. The result is a
ham which is the most popular
antipasto in Italy and can cost as
much as £18 per kilo.
The most exciting ingredient in
Italian food must be Parmigiano
Reggiano (Parmesan Cheese). This
hard cheese can only be made from
milk produced between April and
November in production zones
specified bv law. The cheese can be
eaten after as little as a year's
maturation when it is known as
nuovo. After another year it develops
a stronger flavour and it is known
as vecchio. It may even be matured
for a third year.
The choice of pastas available in
Bologna is large. The purists insist
that pasta should be freshly made
and rolled out by hand using a
wooden rolling pin because this
gives a rougher finish to the pasta
enabling it to hold the sauce better.
This enhances the pleasure of eating
it.
Bologna and Modena are the
home of tortellini. It can often be
seen being prepared by the women
who work in the shops that sell
pasta. The square of pasta with the
filling, is folded into a triangle and
wound into shape—the shape of
Venus's navel as legend has it.
Bologna Mortadella a smooth pork
sausage is another delicacy that
cannot be missed. The larger sizes
of this pork sausage are considered
the finest and can cost about £15 per
kilo. 1 found it quite convenient to
try many of these regional favourites
at l u n c h . The porticos were
peppered with bars that also
displayed a wide range of cured
meats and freshly baked bread. It
was possible to get custom-made
sandwiches using whichever
ingredients you fancied.
Part 2
Long live cunia povera
The columnist shares the experience
of an evening in the kitchen with a
friend's grandmother, a passionate
Bolognese cook.
A proud 77 year-old, Nonna
(Grandmother) Zelina insisted that
she was not a bella anymore but
veccia (old). Remembering the
terminology of maturing cheeses I
agreed that she was veccia but not
quite straveccia (very old). We both
chuckled.
Zelina told me that the method of
preparing the regional favourites
had not changed in her kitchen for
the past fifty years. She was very
proud of the Emilian cuisine and of
the tradition of Bologna. She
produced her copy of the L'Artusi
before giving a demonstration of
how to make crescentine: puffs of
Bologna—A major centre of learning in Italy'
wheat with a crispy skin and a fluffy
interior. The dough was divided
into balls the size of small apples
and rolled out into oval discs using
a wooden rolling pin on a large
wooden board. Waving the pin and
pointing to the board she said that
it had taken her more than a decade
to master the use of the equipment
to be able to make fresh pasta such
as tagliatelle. There was a sadness
in her voice as she knew that it is
a skill that is fast disappearing as it
is not being taken up bv the younger
generation.
The oval discs of dough were
shallow fried to make the crescentine.
They were very simple to make—
the secret being to make the dough
to the right consistency. The
crescentine were served with razor
thin slices of prosciutto crudo,
salami, pickled onions and lightly
boiled vegetables (sweet peppers,
aubergines, courgettes) in an olive
oil and vinegar dressing.
She insisted that the king of the local
cuisine (the tortellini) has 'his o w n
taste' and must be eaten cooked in
a meat broth and not with a ragu
(meat sauce). Indeed, if one uses
regal ingredients like mortadella,
parmeggiano and pork to stuff the
tortellini, one does not want to
disguise it in a ragu. Bollito misto the
second pillar of the local cuisine is
a tribute to slow cooking. A wide
range of meats including whole
chicken, rabbit, beef, tongue,
zamponc (stuffed pigs trotters) and
cotechino are simmered on a low
flame for several hours until the
meat is very tender and the liquid
has turned into a tasty broth. The
meat is served on a platter in
manageable pieces. It is eaten
together with a vegetable sauce such
as salsa verde.
She pointed out that Romagnol
cuisine is different than that of
Emilia. In Emilia the stuffed pasta
is preferred in a small compact
shape, but in Romagna it is larger,
known as agnollotti. The agnollotti
have a sweeter taste because they
also contain squash.
It was not enough to talk about
the best Bolognese cooking, Zelina
told me to go to eat at Ristorante
Diana (24A Via Dell Indipendenza,
the road that links the railway
station to the Piazza Maggiore). She
had known Diana's reputation even
before the last war. I tried the
tortellini in brodo and the billito
misto e salsa verde. The two course
meal without antipasti and dolce,
but with a half litre of house wine
cost £18. The impeccable service and
warm atmosphere helped make the
good food into a success. I implore
you not to miss some of Bologna's
gastronomic crown jewels if you
make a visit to this city.
Continued next week.
