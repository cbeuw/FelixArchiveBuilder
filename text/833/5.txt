Opinion
Turn up, turn off, drop out
Does Imperial College produce disillusioned, disheartened students? Is there more to
a university education than a hard slog? Are academics out of touch with the real needs
of the students. Sydney Harbour Bridge thinks so....
I joined this College six years ago
along with a number of other fresh
and enthusiastic young 18 and 19
year-olds. A m o n g them were two
people who we shall, for arguments
sake, call Giles and Caroline. At the
end of the second year Giles and
Caroline were very different to all
their friends who had entered with
them. This was not because they
unless you are going
to get a 2:1 or a first
class degree Imperial
will give you a very
raw deal
were disillusioned with IC, bored
with its lack of insight or tired of
being overworked as many of their
friends were. Giles and Caroline
were different because they were no
longer at IC. Giles had managed to
fail his first year exams a total of four
times in two years and Caroline,
having struggled in her first year,
left before reading her second year
exams. Both, m u c h to their
successful' friends' surprise,
obtained places in their respective
subjects (Mech Eng and Elec Eng) at
Kings College. Giles and Caroline
have now graduated from Kings
with a Universitv of London degree,
exactlv as their fellows at IC did, but
w i t h o u t that prestigious
qualification, the Associateship of
City & Guilds. The interesting fact
is that they both graduated with first
class Honours. What's more Giles
was informed that his grades were
higher than any previously gained
by a student on his course.
Both Giles and Chris thoroughly
enjoyed their time at K i n g s ,
experiencing a lively social life
whilst experimenting in other mind
broadening acitivities which added
further to their C V ' s .
I had a chat with Giles over a pint
when he was halfway through his
second year. Giles commented;
'Failing at IC was the best thing that
ever happened to me!' He left the
pub at 8pm to do that week's
problem sheets and returned by
"tOpm having doubtlessly got an ' A '
grade in the intervening hours.
Members of staff at IC will tell you
that an Imperial Degree is worth
more than a Kings Degree and so it
mav be; it certainly was in the past.
Mind you, if Giles or Caroline do
not wish to enter the Engineering
field which is, after all, underpaid
they will find that most employers
view Imperial and Kings degrees
simply as Degrees of the University
of London.
Who came out best off, Giles or
the person who beat him in his IC
exams by possibly only two or three
per cent? That person probably
struggled through his College for
three years and graduated as a
dejected disillusioned student,
perhaps only to gain a third or a
pass degree. Try telling that person
the system is fair!
It is my belief that unless you are
going to get a 2.1 or first class
degree, Imperial will give you a very
raw deal. Thev work you very hard,
contact hours are higher than in
almost any university in Britain,
teaching standards generally very
low, the opinions of the staff has a
marked affect on your exam results
and the intention is to throw as
much information at you as possible
over as short a time as possible —
to hell with trying to get the
message across. Worse than this,
the College, knowingly or not, is
reducing the access of students to
other important activities.
There are two sides to a university
education and academia is only one
of them. If IC graduates are to
succeed in a variety of different
activities after College they must
leave with a rounded character.
Here I must qualify the position by
stating that some exceptional
students have managed to achieve
both areas, but then again so many
that arrived here with great promise
have not. The system is truly good
for the excellent but how many must
fall bv the wayside or to a 2.2.
The Rector will of course tell you,
as he once told the Governing Body
that students at IC are quite happy
thankyou very much. After all, he
should know—he has been Rector
here for three years and was a
student here in the 1950s.
But is the Rector really in touch
with ordinary students? Last year
Professor A s h told me that he could
not find one day in the whole year
to go around College and see it from
a student's point of view.
He was so out of touch with the
financial problems face'd by students
that his first comment to me, as
Union President, was 'I hope you
are going to push for an increase in
the student residential stock without
quibbling about rents'—ignoring the
fact that we already have the highest
rents in the university system. I fail
to see how a man like this has the
audacity to make any comment on
the teaching at IC.
The majority of College staff will
agree with the Rector's opinion but
it is this arrogant state of self-
'failing IC was the
best thing that ever
happened to me'
importance prevalent in IC that cost
Giles an 'Imperial Degree'. The
College can spend as much time as
it likes trying to con students into
c o m i n g to IC w i t h fancy
prospectuses and talks with school
teachers, but I refuse to have
anything to do with it.
In the past the College has tried
to ensure that the U n i o n ' s
Alternative Prospectus should be
written by a 'high performing
student'; one of the ones who isn't
getting a raw deal. Well they
haven't got enough time or enough
guts to risk a decent degree by
telling the truth.
If the Rector wants to increase the
percentage of women at IC he
should deal with the problems in
the social life rather than making
them believe it's a wonderful place.
Yet the organiser of the Women i n
Science & Engineering (WISE)
Substitute Female Recruitment
Conference, told me two years ago
' O h we couldn't do that we don't
want them meeting any IC men,'
when I offered to organise a series
of free disco parties for what was a
very bored bunch of school girls.
Imperial's reputation is flagging
and the cost of living here is
increasing. If the Academics want to
save their jobs they'd better start
taking some pride in their teaching
and in their students.
One cheering last note, remember
if you fail the impending exams you
can always leave and go to Kings,
or Manchester, or Leeds, or Bath, or
almost anywhere you might find it's
cheaper.
