The Dead Pool
San Francisco's finest, Inspector
Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is
back on the streets, fighting the
cancer of crime with the aid of his
Smith and Wesson Model 29, and
new deeper voice.
His latest success story is the
incarnation of crime lord Lou Janero
on a murder charge. This however
makes him a target for the mob's hit
men. The media circus surrounds
Harry, but he just wants to get on
with his job.
Across the city another lousy
b l o o d a n d guts m o v i e is i n
production. Director Peter Swan
(Liam Neeson) plays a macabre
meeting, held in a sixty-foot cylinder
block, wherein Maria sings You are
the Light and shows Neil Kinnock
how to do h i s job properly.
Meanwhile, George has seen the
upper-world and is confounded by
the majesty of it all. Like leaving
Imperial to wander around Chelsea
awhile.
But greater plans are afoot as
Freeman exploits the help of
scientist Warner (Jonathan Adams)
and replaces Maria with the robot
Futura. Will the hopes of the
uncherished be dashed? O r can
Steven save Maria, the people, and
put and end to Thatcher's Britain?
Well, what do you think?
The combination of twisting,
swinging, sliding sets, from the
Pater Noster machine, the control
centre and the science lab, to the
travelling tubes which ferry the cast
on a n d off-stage throughout,
provide enough complex kinetics to
make Metropolis a v i s i o n a r y
masterpiece.
The singing too is good, especially
Blessed's thumping baritone which
brings life and sparkle to the stage.
Unfortunately he is scarcely to be
seen, scarcer heard, and there
results a vacuum in the set.
Beyond this there remain two
faults. The songs, with one or two
exceptions, are b l a n d a n d
u n m e m o r a b l e , a n d often
punctuated by an irritating siren.
The motion of the set does not
overcome the generally static cast,
and there are none of the essential
dance routines symbolising such
musical competition as Cats or
Starlight Express. The occasionally
prolonged choreography was a gust
of fresh air i n an otherwise stale
collection of insipid atmospherics.
All I can conclude is that there are
better wasy of spending £3 million,
and for that matter, £8.50.

game with members of his crew,
called the Dead Pool. Each draws up
a list of celebrities least likely to
survive the year, and the winner is
the one with the greatest mortality
count. When his junkie rock star
lead, Johnny Squares, buys it with
a mouth full of synthetic heroin,
police attention focuses on Swan.
Later, the dead pool list comes to
light, Johnny Squares is on it and
suspicions are aroused. Two more
murders pin the blame squarely on
Swan, but Callahan has other ideas.
He is also mixed up in a developing
relationship w i t h T V news
anchorwoman Samantha Walker
(Patricia Clarkson) and still getting
shot at by The Family. A n d all he
wants to do is solve the case.
Eventually he does just that, as
you know he must. Along the way
the audience is treated to a
profusion of death and violence,
interlaced with a sub-plot exploring
the effects and aspects of its media
coverage. 'You're just interested in
blood and death' says Harry to
Samantha, but when she is making
the news her attitudes change.
This inspection is paralleled in the
films made by Swan. 'People are
fascinated by death and violence.
That's why my films are successful.'
Strange that Eastwood should
highlight such a sick audience
demeanour, for if it did not exist he
wouldn't be as popular as' he is.
A r n o l d Schwarzenegger's The
Running Man was guilty of the same
hypocrisy.
Still, a little murdrous intent never
hurt anyone. The Dead Pool is exactly
what you would expect from Clint
Eastwood. H i s ' acting style is as
consistent as ever, his few carefully
chosen w o r d s p r o v i d i n g the
sarcasm and wisecracks that he is
k n o w n for. He even gains a new
catch-phrase, 'You're shit out of
luck'.
The novel car chase, strong acting
and direction, a n d impressive
cinematography do not stop this
being just another thriller. But to
quote Peter Swan, 'Clint Eastwood
sells tickets. You know, bums on
seats, love.'

Indigo
Almeida Theatre, Islington
The late 18th century. The port of
Liverpool monopolising nearly one
third of the entire European slave
market. Two young men, sons of
powerful fathers, caught up against
this violent backdrop. Disease
reigns:
Indigo is a new play, billed as
'savagely poetic drama about
possession and betrayal. Written by
a woman with talent, performed by
a good, sometimes excellent, cast,
well staged, with impressive music'
Somehow, I think, it ought to have
been a lot better.
W i l l i a m R a n d e l l , a k i n d of
subdued Rik Mayall character, is
sent to command his father's slave
ship. Ide the African Prince, his
language dense with imagery and
metaphor, so annoys his father, the
king, that he is led to be sold at the
marketplace. Astonished, and then
disillusioned, at the death of a loyal
friend, Ide refuses to eat, thus killing
himself and, at the same time,
commanding William's obsessive
admiration. William attempts to
come to terms with the death by
bedding Ide's woman...
The drama should build up to
some climax of energy and passion.
Instead it is rather patchy, the play
being most gripping, and best
performed in the mid stages, where
action overrides the flowery script,
and some acting is superb. The
stage, sloping down towards the
audience, seems menacing i n its
guise as hefty slave ship a n d
anticipated meeting between the
two main characters occurs with a
flash and hiss of the hot branding
iron. But then actictfi wanes, the
pace slows a n d the language
thickens once more.
Not completely natural, but
neither far enough gone to be called
stylised, the writer's technique
seems tentative, trying too much to
be all-embracing, which ultimately
loses effect. I want a tighter, more
controlled approach.
There are a great many ideas in
this play. Sadly, this is a problem.
Just as we grasp one thread another
crosses over it, helped by very dense
poetic language. The result is a
tangle. Meaning is lost as the (very
able) cast spew out rich dialogue,
hints in the plot are too plentiful and
not always followed up. Themes
which could be developed into a
worthwhile whole are given five
minutes airing only (the concept of
'home', colour of skin, corruption
of ideals, possessive instincts and
many more: all touched upon, but
never explored or opened up). The
play is too long. There is too much
in it.
A l t o u g h not a n unqualified
success itself, Indigo has many
happy moments, and shows the
promise of talents still to come into
f r u i t i o n . A nice t r y , w i t h a
provocative glimpse into the future.
