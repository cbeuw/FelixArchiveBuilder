Well, I’m now more than half-
way through the ‘ten things I
can do’, and overall, feedback
has been positive. That is to
say, I’ve had feedback from
about seven people – three
were positive, three negative
(there’s no pleasing some
people) and one person com-
mented that when their toi-
let paper ran out, my article
made a comfortable substi-
tute, so I’m counting that as a
positive. If anyone disagrees
with this conclusion, feel free
to email, but bear in mind
this week’s topic is specifical-
ly endorsed by the man with
the wobbliest voice in popular
music – David Bowie.
I highly recommend you
go to your local Blockbuster,
find the section with the 1980s
films and look up Labyrinth.
This is the film where David
Bowie impressed everyone
with two skills: the ability to
spin crystal balls in a hyp-
notic display of light and col-
our, and the ability to convinc-
ingly interact with a blob of
latex that has Jim Henson’s
hand up its arse. I’m afraid
I’ll have to dash people’s
dreams right here – David
Bowie can’t contact juggle at
all, and had a chap with his
hands through the costume
doing it all for him. The good
news is, you too can look just
like he did. Now if you can
only imitate the spiky hairdo,
you’ll be more David Bowie
than David Bowie.
OK, first thing’s first.
Contact juggling is about
moving a ball around your
body so that it remains in
contact (nearly) all the time.
If you throw it, that’s normal
juggling, and just being able
to juggle one ball isn’t that
impressive. To contact jug-
gle, start off with a ball in
the palm of your right hand,
as Steve demonstrates [see
picture 1].
Now throw the ball and
rotate your arm so that the
ball lands on the back of your
hand [see pictures 2 and 3].
Each time toss the ball a lit-
tle closer to your hand so
that eventually it just rolls up
over your fingers and keeps
in contact with your hand at
all times.
Note the position of the fin-
gers – they cradle the ball
so that it doesn’t fall off [see
picture 4].
Now you just have to roll
it across to the back of your
left hand, and perform the
same motion again, and you’ll
have it in your left palm [see
pictures 5 and 6]. Seems so
simple doesn’t it? Once it’s
in your left palm, you can
repeat the entire process and
end up with the ball in the
right palm. If you’re bored by
now (heaven forbid) then you
can try www.contactjuggling.
org for more ideas and nice
pretty videos.
Ah, it all looks so easy. If you
fancy coming along to juggling
on a Tuesday from 6pm in
the Union, email juggling@ic.
ac.uk and leave a message
after the beep. If you have
something you can do that
I can’t, then also please let
me know as I’m always on
the lookout for new things to
play with.

Every year in the spring term,
the ICU Choir spends a week-
end away from college for two
days of intensive rehearsals
and socialising, and this year
our chosen destination was
Imperial’s Wye campus.
Saturday morning kicked
off with an early start, meet-
ing at 7.45am in a bitterly
cold Beit Quad. The choir’s
enthusiasm didn’t falter, how-
ever, and once all our sleep-
ing bags had been bundled
into the coach, we were on
our way (much to the relief of
the 2012 Olympic committee,
who were assembling in the
Quad at the same time!)
Breakfast was served
on arrival and everything
seemed to be running
smoothly until we discov-
ered we’d forgotten Therees’
music stand! Thankfully our
very own Deputy President
(Education and Welfare)
and former Choir chair, Sam
Rorke, came to our rescue
later in the afternoon (we
knew the sabbaticals would
be useful one day!)
By 5.30pm and three
rehearsals later we were
ready to kick back and relax,
and that’s when the fun really
started! Thanks to our offi-
cial Wye guide Nichola, we
were able to enjoy our pick
of evening meals, whether
it was traditional ‘pub grub,’
Indian or Chinese that took
your fancy. We then ended
the day by regrouping at the
Wye union for a pub quiz and
karaoke session. The com-
mittee had spent many long
hours carefully preparing
the quiz on the coach jour-
ney, during lunch and even
the afternoon break! Topics
varied from ‘How well do you
know the choir and commit-
tee’ to ‘Science and Imperial’
to ‘Name that ringtone’. We
even managed to include a
polling round and discovered
that the choir is more par-
tial to triangular sandwiches
than square!
The karaoke was started by
one of our very brave basses
Alex Field, who sang Enrique
Inglesias’ Hero. As the rest
of the teams seemed reluc-
tant to follow his lead, it was
decided to give bonus quiz
points to any participants that
took to the stage. One team,
who called themselves ‘This
is a pencil’, really got into the
spirit of things and I think few
of us will forget their rendi-
tions of The Tide Is High and
Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.
They even went on to win the
quiz... perhaps due to the vast
number of bonus points they
managed to obtain!
Other highlights included
chairs past, present and
future, (Sam, Stef and Kate)
singing It’s Raining Men, the
present and future commit-
tee’s version of the karaoke
classic I Will Survive (some-
one had to do it) and tickets
officer Mark serenading us
with I Believe I Can Fly by R
Kelly. A special mention must
also be given to an enthusi-
astic group of Wye students
and our very own Elvis imper-
sonator. The evening then
ended with 40-odd people
singing as loudly as they pos-
sibly could to Angels before
we retired to the JCR with
our sleeping bags.
On Sunday morning
Therees was greeted by a
slightly less energetic choir,
but after some tea and coffee
we were ready for another
three rehearsals. By the end
of the day, we had all had our
fill of biscuits and were satis-
fied with a great weekend of
singing... if not feeling a little
bit hoarse (especially our four
tenors who, despite severely
lacking in numbers, gave it
their all!)
So if you want to see just
what we managed to achieve
over a weekend, come and
see us perform Brahms’s
German Requiem on
Thursday 10 March in the
Great Hall. If last weekend
was anything to go by, it’s not
to be missed!
