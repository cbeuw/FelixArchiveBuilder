EXHIBITION
The exhibition’s official title is Turks:
A Journey of a Thousand Years,
600-1600, which give one a good idea
of what one is going to see.
What you will see housed in the
Academy’s main galleries is a vast
collection of over 350 items on loan
from a number of institutions from
11 countries. Of course, most of the
pieces on show are from Turkey,
primarily from the Topkapi Saray
Museum and the Museum of Turkish
and Islamic Art in Istanbul, and
many have never been seen outside
of Turkey. This is the first exhibition
at the Royal Academy to be made
up principally of Islamic art since
the 1931 International Exhibition of
Persian Art, so it is definitely not an
opportunity to be missed.
The route through the exhibition
has been planned to take visitors
chronologically through the devel-
opment of the culture and the art
of the Turks. Unlike the Carlsberg
exhibition, there is no way of get-
ting even vaguely lost. The journey
begins with the nomadic tribe of
the Uyghurs in Central Asia in the
seventh century; the Uyghurs’ lands
coincided with the route of the Silk
Road and from this they prospered.
On show are textiles and frescoes,
reflecting the richness and varie-
ty of cultures and religions with
which the Uyghurs interacted. The
influence of the far east, in par-
ticular China, is clearly visible here
and, surprisingly, remains so right
through the entire exhibition.
The journey then moves on to
explore another nomadic tribe, the
Seljuks. They originate in Central
Asia but eventually manage to
expand their area of influence to the
eastern Mediterranean; this is the
first time that the exhibition crosses
into the geographical territory that
is now modern Turkey. The Seljuks
sweep westwards from 1040, coming
through Iraq and Iran. It was on this
westward drive that the end of the
nomadic life began for the Turkic
tribes as they adopted many Iranian
institutions, established their sys-
tem of government and became
great patrons of the arts; for this
we are grateful, otherwise the offer-
ings on show here would be of a far
lesser volume and calibre.
The Seljuks eventually succumbed
to the great Mongol onslaught.
Although this had something of a
halting effect on the Turkic tribes’
sponsorship of the arts, it was not
a fatal stroke. This was the catalyst
for the rise of the Ottoman Empire
under the leadership of Tamerlane
in the 14th century. Tamerlane man-
aged to finally fuse the nomadic
Central Asian culture with the set-
tled culture of Iran. Islam became
the religion of the state; learning,
architecture and art thrived. As we
know, the Byzantine Empire fell to
the Ottomans, whose influence at
one point reached as far west as the
Balkans.
However, while the historical
background is very interesting, it
is, after all, the art for which one
goes to such exhibitions! On show
are impressively preserved carpets,
intricately and sumptuously deco-
rated kaftans belonging to Ottoman
emperors, swords and helmets, jew-
elled bowls and pieces from the
largest collection of porcelain out-
side of China. While all of these
pieces are all stunning, my particu-
lar favourites were the illustrations
of Siyah Qalem, the mosaic doors by
the architect Sinan and in particular
the beautifully illuminated Qurans
on display.
The works by Siyah Qalem, oth-
erwise known as ‘Mohamed of the
Black Pen’, are a real coup for the
Royal Academy. They have never
been seen out of Turkey and the
remaining pieces can be viewed
almost in their entirety. The draw-
ings date from the Seljuk period and
depict the illustrator’s travels and
interpretations of a number of leg-
ends. They are wonderful for their
breadth of content, but in particular
for their detail and stylistic variety.
While by the time that Siyah Qalem
was working, the Seljuks were
already well on their way west, the
influence of the Far East is still very
palpable.
If you went to the illustrated
manuscripts exhibition at the Royal
academy last year, or even if in
retrospect you think it may have
been interesting, I would definitely
urge you to go to the Turks show
to see the beautiful work that has
been done in the decoration of the
Qurans on show, not to mention the
illustrated books of poetry that are
also there. The gorgeous geometric
patterns that are present in the
illustration of the Qurans can also
been seen to fantastic effect on the
huge wooden doors by Sinan for
the Sultan Murad III. Dating from
c. 1578, the doors are two and a
half metres tall and are inscribed
and decorated purely in wood. Sinan
used wood in the same way that dif-
ferent coloured marbles have been
used throughout Europe to deco-
rate and depict patterns; the effect
is stunning.
I must say that I have few com-
plaints about this exhibition. It is
huge, so I wouldn’t suggest going if
you’re not feeling energetic, but it is
also highly enlightening. However,
there is always one thing about exhi-
bitions these days that never fails to
annoy me immensely: audioguides.
They’re everywhere, galleries and
historical monuments, and probably
other places that I wouldn’t care
to explore. They’re not particularly
enriching, they go on for ever, tell
you stuff you never wanted to know
and if you did, you could have found
in a book quite easily, force you
to follow somebody else’s predeter-
mined course, and most irritatingly
of all they always have you stop
in front of the tiniest pieces in an
exhibition, building up a huge crowd
and preventing any other poor souls
from seeing those items.
Whatever happened to independ-
ent study? If you are really that
interested about an item why not
search for information yourself – I
assure you it’s far more rewarding,
and if you really must have it spoon
fed to you, buy the catalogue, go on
a gallery tour, attend an event linked
to the exhibition or even begin some
correspondence with the exhibition
curator if you must!
Apartfromtheobviouspaincaused
to me by my fellow patrons’ reli-
ance on audioguides, the exhibition
was really an enjoyable experience.
Thankfully, the Royal Academy does
now open late, up until 10pm, on
Saturdays as well as Fridays, so
there are now even more opportuni-
ties to go and get some culture.

PLAY REVIEWS
Based on the novels by Philip
Pullman, this two-part production,
totalling over six hours of perform-
ance time, is best described as a
spectacular sensory overload.
Philip Pullman is known for ‘steal-
ing’ themes from other authors and
in the His Dark Materials trilogy, if
you take a look, you will see every-
thing from Shakespeare to Chekhov
to Dickens.
His Dark Materials is a coming
of age experience for the central
characters, Will and Lyra. The play
begins in Oxford, but it’s immediate-
ly apparent that this Oxford is not
the same as the Oxford we are famil-
iar with. As Will and Lyra meet and
experience danger, fear, excitement
and friendship, they are constantly
in search of answers. The queries
change, but the search for answers
is always prevalent.
Each level and pocket of space is
used wisely by the National Theatre.
In the six hours of watching this
treasure, there were only about five
scene settings that repeated them-
selves. The lighting and sound was
virtually flawless. Each scene tran-
sition was seamless, thanks to the
work of a dedicated technical staff.
Each performer, including the
spectacular puppeteers and their
puppets, had obviously taken the
time to carefully craft his or her
character. His Dark Materials is
appropriate for ages 12 to 82, and
has something different to offer for
each audience member.
If you’re unfamiliar with the books,
it’s a good idea to do a Google search
for Philip Pullman before you go,
and read a synopsis of the books so
that you know what to expect.
Part I has been sold out until the
end of the run, but there are returns
and other options for getting tickets
if desired. The final performances
take place on 2 April. This run will
not be extended and there are no
plans to revive the show.
It’s one hellish winter day in the
rural Ireland community of the Bog
of Cats. Hester Swane, played by
Holly Hunter, has been abandoned
by the father of her child whom
she is still deeply in love with. This
particular day is the day he plans
to marry a young girl with a rich
father. Hester tries everything in
her power to get him back, whilst
resisting the efforts of all those who
want her to leave the Bog of Cats
forever.
Written in 1998 by Marina Carr,
By the Bog of Cats is a respectable
piece. It’s not really worth the West
End ticket price, but it will enter-
tain for a few hours. If you aren’t
adjusted to thick Irish accents done
by Americans, the first 20 minutes
of the show might be a bit hard to
understand, as it was for me. But I
didn’t miss out on a whole lot. The
storyline is very easy to follow. The
ending is most predictable, but car-
ried out swiftly and successfully.
This is mediocrity at its best. It’s
a nice experience, but it’s nothing to
get excited about. No rushing to the
theatre is required, but if you’ve got
a few extra pounds lying around and
you feel like seeing something in the
West End, try this... it’s not going to
hurt you.
