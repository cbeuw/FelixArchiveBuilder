FRIDAY
Having been to Turnmills on numer-
ous occasions (and having actually
started working there) I can hon-
estly say I have never seen the club
get completely rammed so quickly
– the place was full by 11.30pm.
Not being a trance boy, I’m not too
knowledgeable on which DJs are
really famous, so I couldn’t under-
stand why it had reached capacity,
but when midnight came they had to
stop letting people into the club.
My ignorance soon ended when a
scary midget Dutch pillhead cyber
informed me that she had come
from Holland just for this night as
the line-up was so good. Apparently,
to see Ferry Corsten or AVB on their
own is a big deal, but to see them
together is something that could not
be missed.
Trance not being my favourite
type of music I didn’t quite know
what to expect. This was good as I
was blown away. The atmosphere
was amazing – people were prop-
erly having it before midnight. The
mixing was impeccable from the
headliners.
The main complaint I heard all
night though was about the treat-
ment people had received from the
staff. I’m surprised people still go
back time after time to Turnmills, as
the door staff are some of the rud-
est people I’ve ever met. They were
abusive and control freaks, and this
sort of behaviour is enough to spoil
your entire night. I spoke to one
girl who got manhandled because
she questioned paying £15 when the
flyer said that with your student
card you only had to pay £12. This
seems to be a continuing problem
with a lot of the big clubs in London
– they have the opinion that they can
treat their customers like dirt and
that it’s OK.
Having said in the past that most
hard house/hard trance nights are
full of towny pillheads, I will take
that all back. There was a huge
mix; there were people from all over
the world. Some of the clubbers
had planned holidays from America
around this night. This mix is always
good because people with tans are
generally far more attractive than
the pasty Brit.
Drinking in clubs is always
expensive, but this is something
you just have to accept. The pric-
es at Turnmills are not the worst.
However, it is not acceptable to be
made to pay £3 for a bottle of water
which is the size of a can of coke.
This wouldn’t be so bad if you could
come and go from the club as you
please, but then I suppose the club
wouldn’t make as much money and
wouldn’t be able to bring in the big
names.
All in all, the night was a huge suc-
cess. The club stayed open an extra
hour because the people just wanted
to party. The only down side was
the attitude of the door staff, which
I think is a huge problem because
if people are harassed when they
arrive at a club they are more likely
to get into trouble while there.
SATURDAY
We all know who Eric Prydz is, and if
we don’t we certainly know his video.
You know, the aerobics one with the
girls in small lycras. OK, perhaps
some of the girls aren’t too familiar
with it, but all the guys are.
So, from a DJ set, you would expect
a mix of crappy chart dance. Well
you would be wrong, just like I was.
You couldn’t be further from what
actually happened – it was a mix of
deep house with a bit of electro, and
the back room was pure funk.
Thankfully the club was nowhere
near as rammed as on the Friday
for The Gallery; you could actually
make your way through the dance-
floor.
The crowd was an eclectic mix.
You had your beautiful fashion kids
and a few beer boys who expect-
ed poppy tripe. There seemed to
be quite a few older people there
as well. This I always find a bit
strange. I don’t know if it’s because
I’m incredibly ageist, but there is
something very odd about a 45-year
old gran dropping, it doesn’t seem
quite right. The guy to girl ratio was
very good, about half and half.
The staff, this time, seemed to
have sorted out all of the issues they
had the night before and were sur-
prisingly cheerful. This may have
been due to the lack of a neverend-
ing queue or because the weath-
er wasn’t so cold. The stewards
strangely also seemed to know what
was going on.
The best thing about this night
was that if you so wished and you
were feeling incredibly hardcore
you could carry on clubbing until
2pm the next day, as Trade started
in the back room at 5.30am.
I would recommend this night if
you like it deep – musically speak-
ing. If you like it that little bit funkier,
the back room had plenty to offer.
It was tune after tune after tune, a
true delight for the ears.
SUNDAY
This was my first visit to The Cross
and I have to say the only word to
describe everything is ‘random’.
It is in the most random place
ever, buried behind King’s Cross
station in the industrial area under
a bridge. The club has palm trees
and sofas outside. Even though it
was a mission to get to, it was well
worth it.
Vertigo is a night of Italian polysex-
ualism, which basically means if
you’re gay, straight, bi or just a bit
of a whore, this is the night for you.
It was attitude-free with some of
the most beautiful people I have
seen in a long while; fair enough
they can’t all speak English, but that
doesn’t matter as they then can’t
understand how much of a retard
you are when you’re chatting them
up. As it is a Sunday night, most of
the crowd had been at it all week-
end and some probably hadn’t slept
or changed their clothes. Nobody
noticed of course, as the majority
of the people were so mashed they
could barely see.
Something that was very funny
was the number of people wearing
sunglasses. Not just a few, like you
see in most clubs, but almost every-
one had a pair. It was like a branch
of Specsavers had been built next
door and they had a sale of tinted
lenses. Also I think if you added up
how much the clientele had spent
on fake tan, you would be able to
clear the third world debt. This
was strange as most were Italian
and naturally tanned anyway. They
looked a bit scary.
The music was amazing; it was
exactly what I needed after a long
weekend of harder stuff.
The layout of the club is quite
strange as there is no main or back
room, it’s just two rooms. The lighter
room was playing the best of Italian
funky house and the dark, smoke
filled room had a music policy very
fitting to the atmosphere. It was
dark, dirty and rough. I spent most
of my time in the funky room as
I could see all of the sexy people
better.
Some of the mixing was a bit off
but it didn’t seem to matter too
much – people were there to have a
good time, and a good time was had
by all. Many interesting conversa-
tions were had as well. This one guy
was convinced I was his friend as I
had the same mouth as him – a bit
strange, but to be fair to the guy I
don’t think he even knew who he
was by that stage. Aw, bless.
The staff were really helpful and
happy too, which is nice. I don’t
quite understand why, but oh well.
The bar staff were incredibly quick
which maintained a high turnover at
the bar. Of course this doesn’t come
free, as the drinks were incredibly
expensive.
Having not have slept much between
going out over the weekend and
writing these reviews, they don’t
seem to be too informative. I can
just say I had a great time at all the
places I went to, but now I think a
bit of plastic surgery is in order as I
look like absolute shit.

Well as you can see we’ve got anoth-
er batch of London’s finest nightlife
tried and tested. Hopefully some of
you out there are trying something
new or finding something that you’d
missed before.
I’m well aware that we focus most-
ly on house music on these pages,
but really that’s just because it’s
what we like. If there’s somewhere
or some night we’re not covering
here that you think we should, let
us know, or better yet volunteer!
Reviewing is a great blag as you
and a mate get on the list, so you
can save plenty on entrance, only
to spend it on drinks again. If you’re
interested, or have any comments or
suggestions, let me know by email at
clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk.
Just to show you how much we
care, we have a special treat for you.
Oh, yes. Take a glance at the other
page and you’ll see that Felix has
done some blagging on your behalf,
and there are four tickets to see
Mylo at Neighbourhood tomorrow
up for grabs. Enjoy!
