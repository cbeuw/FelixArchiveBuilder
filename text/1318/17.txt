CLUB PREVIEW
Sometimes it can feel a little bit
lonely here at Imperial. We’re pret-
ty far out of central London, and
when we leave halls most of us end
up living even further west and/or
south, so nocturnal excursions often
involve a fairly long trip ‘uptown’
and an even longer one back in the
small hours.
Lucky for us then, that one of
London’s hottest house clubs,
Neighbourhood, is just a few stops
away over in Ladbroke Grove. The
club is the baby of Everything But
the Girl’s Ben Watt – a top notch
house DJ and producer himself
– and attracts such big names as
4 Hero, Lottie and Norman Jay to
name but a few, as well as regular
sets from Mr Watt.
This Friday, the man at the top
of the bill is Mylo, who is currently
riding the wave of success of his LP
Destroy Rock and Roll.
Originally from the Isle of Skye,
Mylo (aka Myles MacInnes) was
an undergraduate at Oxford before
embarking on a PhD in Philosophy
at UCLA, California.
His musical influences are many
and eclectic – from Squarepusher
to Serge Gainsburg to Daft Punk
and Kraftwerk. This variety shows
through in his music, which is funky,
electronic and has been filling
dancefloors all over for a good year
or so already.
Categorising music feels like such
a bad thing to do, since at the end of
the day genres are mostly a load of
bollocks, but in this case it’s worth
a mention. This is because Mylo
seems to be part of the latest ‘cool’
genre to be proposed: ‘Nu Electro’
(sic).
Now, don’t go thinking I’m the type
of ponce who goes around cham-
pioning the latest buzzword – I’m
merely here to inform, not influ-
ence. No, I just thought it was worth
mentioning this, having noticed in
Virgin the other week that there was
Mylo’s in your Neigbourhood

See Mylo for Free
Yes that’s right, those nice peo-
ple at Neighbourhood are offering
you the chance to go and see ‘Nu-
Electro’ darling Mylo playing there
this Friday, for absolutely nada!
Neighbourhood is located in
Ladbroke Grove, so it’s our end
of town and pretty close to col-
lege. Even if you don’t fancy it,
enter and you might score yourself
a very cheap Mother’s Day gift (and
improve your mum’s taste in music
at the same time).
There are four tickets up for
grabs, and there’s not even a
token question or anything silly
like that. The first four people to
email nikki@neighbourhoodclub.
com will be rewarded with the free
tickets.
a new section in amongst the vinyl,
with the aforementioned label. The
main record they were trying to sell
under this banner was Mylo’s Drop
The Pressure, with the rest being
a similar electro/house/pop selec-
tion. Whilst this latest pigeonholing
might not actually be anything par-
ticularly new, it does provide us with
a useful umbrella under which to
throw various artists, who all seem
to be making radio-friendly, dance-
floor-friendly, exciting new music, of
which Mylo is most definitely one.
Friday promises to be a top night,
with Geddes (of Mulletover) and
Donkey Boss also on the bill, so go
west and you’re in for a treat.
Felix is giving you the chance to go
for free! Check out the competition
below for details.
If you find yourself left want-
ing more after Friday, don’t fear,
because there’s another special
guest at Neighbourhood on 11 March
– Groove Armada’s Andy Cato.

Farewell Dr Gonzo!
“I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone, but they’ve always worked for me”
Books books.felix@ic.ac.uk
Virtually every student in the coun-
try has read, seen or at the very least
heard of Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas, the misadventures of drug-
addled journalist Raoul Duke and
his equally dysfunctional Samoan
attorney in an investigation into the
heart of the American dream. The
novel is a modern masterwork writ-
ten by a walking contradiction of an
author, doctor of journalism Hunter
S Thompson, who died last Sunday
of an apparent suicide. The motives
behind his death appear at first hazy
and indeed it took this writer sev-
eral days to even believe it, but
Thompson (67) was a person who
lived every moment of each day to
its fullest; if he could no longer blow
stuff up, drink heavily, take copious
amounts of drugs and still write,
then what was the point?
Thompson was born in Louisville,
Kentucky, to a relatively normal
middle class family, but would go on
to champion a new form of report-
age known as Gonzo journalism, a
method that puts the writer at the
heart of his very own story.
At the age of nine, Thompson
had his first encounter with the US
establishment, one that would affect
the rest of his life. In an elaborate
plan of revenge on a local bus driv-
er, young Hunter and a few of his
childhood friends tipped over a mail-
box in the path of their school bus;
shortly afterwards an FBI officer
turned up at the Thompson house-
hold asking some rather pointed
questions. It was after calling the
FBI man’s bluff that Thompson
would embark on his remarkable
crusade against authority, later
becoming a counterculture hero
commentating at the scene on eve-
rything from the rise of motorcycle
gangs to the disastrous rise and fall
of the drug culture and the freedom
movements of the sixties.
Thompson became a politics junk-
ie after being caught up and beaten
by the police in a protest outside the
Chicago democratic convention in
1968. The experience traumatised
him into championing civil liberties
in his writing and even running for
sheriff in his hometown of Aspen.
He soon met his nemesis in the form
of Richard Nixon: “He could shake
your hand and stab you in the back
at the same time”.
In the following decades,
Thompson wrote strangely accu-
rate predictions on American poli-
tics, becoming one of the best and
most celebrated critics of the Nixon,
Clinton and Bush governments. In
his most recent articles, he detailed
an America ruled by post 9/11 fear
and total social collapse: “In four
short years he [George W Bush] has
turned our country from a prosper-
ous nation at peace into a desper-
ately indebted nation at war”.
Hunter S Thompson was a man
of excess, almost constantly fuelled
by drugs and booze, forever miss-
ing deadlines and a self-proclaimed
gun fanatic, yet the legacy he leaves
will be always be remembered. Dr
Gonzo was the giant of American lit-
erature, paranoid eccentric, cham-
pion of excess or maybe just the last
of a dying breed of outlaw writers
who struck out against the system
and won.
If you would like to learn more
about the man himself, I would sug-

Strange Tales from a Strange
Time (1979)
● Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas (1971)

journey of a star-crossed
child (2002)
● The Curse of Lono (1983)
● The Rum Diary (1999)
