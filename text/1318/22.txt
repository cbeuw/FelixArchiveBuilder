The undefeated IC ladies’
tennis team went to
Southampton for the first
round of the knockout league.
We were promised the luxury
of indoor courts, which was
an exciting prospect since
we are normally playing in
the rain at Teddington! But
on arrival we found that they
had double booked the courts
and the boys got the indoor,
so we were left with playing
outdoors in the snow!
Everyone was quite anxious
on the IC team, as Emma,
the captain, recognised the
Southampton number one
who had been a former
British player! Nevertheless,
the spirits were high as the
doubles got underway.
Things couldn’t have gone
better as Mili and Lucinda
trounced the Southampton
second pair, 8-2. Shortly after-
wards, Emma and Caroyl
put in a repeat performance,
shaming the opposition’s
number one pair.
The Southampton girls
looked scared and visibly
shaken, which may have been
due to the snow and the freez-
ing conditions! After a short
break that consisted of hot
chocolate and ‘giant’ cookies,
the singles got underway.
Again IC kicked ample ass
with Caroyl, Mili and Sarah
finishing quickly, having won
their singles. Mili aced her
opponent and Sarah out-
classed hers 6-1, 6-0 (ouch).
The last singles to finish was
Emma versus Southampton’s
star player. The rallies were
long and intense. Emma
came up with some amazing
shots, and she put up a val-
iant fight unfortunately losing
in the end.
Overall IC girls won 5-1, and
are now through to the next
round: the quarter-finals!

Imperial Men’s 1st 2
By Pat Farr
“Absolutely massive boys,”
remarked a hamstrung
Star-Nosed Mole via e-mail
midweek; not, for once, on
the size of his Iranian conk,
but rather the importance
of the coming Saturday’s
game. The injured captain
amongst them, this was to
be a swansong for members
of the Imperial old guard on
the Berrylands turf, and what
finer occasion than a crucial
quarter-final cup tie.
The sides shared the spoils
1-1 in the League fixture
earlier in the season, in a
game Imperial largely domi-
nated, but the nature of this
tie saw both teams set out
tentatively, with very little
in the way of possession.
Neither could be faulted for
commitment, however, with a
fired-up General Von Berkles
flying in early doors, sup-
ported on cue by the Bull, a
tenacious Wes, and a trade-
mark brutal challenge from
Highland Cattle fugitive JR
(the farmer called, he does
want you back).
Kimmo The Great took a
nasty elbow to the nose mid-
way through the first half.
Meanwhile, attempts to play
to feet were oft stifled, and
the half remained a scrappy
affair. No clear-cut chances
fell to either side, both being
reduced to long-range efforts
in the way of attacking threat.
Half time came quickly, but
a motivated team talk saw
Imperial really up for the
fight after the break.
The second 45 started much
akin to the first, although
there were gradual signs of
the game starting to open
up. 15 minutes in and it was
Tweed von Cragnuts’ turn to
take a blow to the nose. Some
brief treatment later and the
Woodcock, trooper that he
is, returned to the field to
whip in a speciality corner
from the right. It was from
such a delivery, just minutes
later, that Imperial nicked the
opener. Cragnuts’s corner
was too hot to handle for the
LSE keeper, the ball dropped
to Goatanayanananan and
Wednesday’s Medic-spanker
continued his rich vein of
scoring with a prod home.
Just the break Imperial
needed.
LSE pressed hard in the
following spell, but Imperial
resistance was organised
and persistent. Timur, who
narrowly avoided having his
entire arm bitten off by an
angry tapir in the warm-up
(I arrived on the pitch late,
so I may have misheard),
and Mathan continued to
bite heels up top, an exam-
ple followed feverishly by
those behind. Super Vasquez
and the Pat Farr (back four)
continued to soak up LSE
pressure, presenting several
opportunities for Imperial on
the break.
Marzo-Munooooooz came
close on a couple of occasions,
yet the best chance of the
game followed dogged work
from JR down the right. His
looped centre saw a police
line-up of Mathan, Wes and
an arriving Berksy, all of
whom had time to fold away
theirdeckchairsand putdown
The Economist (Woodcock’s
subscription kicking in)
before tripping over each
other, the ball, the ‘keeper
and one LSE defender in a
cartoon-style dust-cloud.
The ball ended up with the
‘keeper. Somehow.
Increased determination
not to rue this opportunity
culminated in a defensive
clearance, leaving Mathan to
jostle with a lone defender
outside LSE’s box. The
fleet-footed bearded dance-
machine got the better of his
adversary and coolly slotted
home to provide much wel-
come breathing distance for
a focused Imperial outfit, who
stayed right on top of their
game for the remaining 15
minutes. Final whistle, 2-0,
Spiceworld.
Not hardcore super sex,
but nevertheless a job very,
very well done. As the tri-
umph settled in, Kimmo
emerged with a broken conk
of Steve Bruce-like chican-
ery, the veterans enjoyed one
last fat shot of ale at the local
Berrylands hostelry, and now
Imperial march on with great
momentum into their semi-
final clash.
Rest assured, Saturday’s
opponents St George’s will
also be rendered flat-footed
like a platypus, just without
the egg-laying and horny
spurs. Peace.
FOOTBALL
Absolutely massive football
United Hospitals Head
By Ben Anstiss
It has been a common sight
on the embankment of late:
the IC novice first eight pad-
dling away from Putney early
on a bitterly cold February
afternoon, but this was to be
unlike any regular Sunday
outing. Hot off their first win
at Peterborough Head of the
Nene some weeks earlier, the
focus was firmly on the task
ahead: the United Hospitals
Head.
It would be healthy com-
petition with all the London
Medical Schools represented
by boats ranging from novice
to top senior crews. Having
been offered an invitational
place just 72 hours previously,
the crew was excited to be
racing again, if for no other
reason than to break up the
seemingly endless training
schedule set by their illustri-
ous coach Ed Johnson whose
support and guidance they
would have to do without on
the day as he pursued his
international ambitions with
the GB squad in Seville.
Having made the journey
to Chiswick through some
rough water and cold winds,
the crew were all glad of the
opportunity to get out of the
boat at UL for a quick stretch
and some banter with their
medic counterparts. It also
gave the ideal opportunity
to relieve the boat of some
excessweight,consisting,asit
turned out, of half of Charlie’s
winter wardrobe (we let him
keep the head-band!)
A little over two hours after
leaving Putney the boat was
heading further upstream, for
many of the eight in un-char-
tered water, to Isleworth and
the start line at pink lodge.
Sitting at the back of the
field, where we were to start
from, everyone was pretty
relaxed, finding plenty of
time for the power nap that
is customary of the pre-race
preparation of late! We all
found ourselves slightly more
alert, however, as we watched
the top GKT (last years win-
ners) and Imperial Medics
boats row past during their
warm up. We agreed that
they both looked rather good.
Neither boat stayed in our
minds for long though as we
began to concentrate on the
race plan and, perhaps more
importantly, on the extremely
attractive blonde female that
was occupying the two seat of
a RUMS novice boat!
We started the race amid
a deluge of hail and snow (it
had been sunny with blue
sky’s less than two minutes
before!) with choppy water
thrown in for good meas-
ure! Early on we effortlessly
moved past the crew immedi-
ately ahead of us, and despite
a few minor discrepancies in
technique that had the boat
unsettled for a few strokes,
we swiftly settled into the
race. A third of the distance
gone and the water became
much calmer, the weather
conditions rapidly improved
and with that the boat moved
on as we approached Kew
Bridge. A masterful display
of coxing, of which we have
become accustomed, saw the
boat move out of the stream
before the bridge and with a
push called we undertook two
crews majestically as we flew
under the central arch.
With shouts of support from
a mass of spectators on the
bridge to spur us on, using
the two boats in our wake to
push away from and with the
RUMS blonde to impress, we
put the hammer down. The
boat was flying. UL boat house
came and went and with one
last big effort we increased
the stroke rate and pushed
through the finish line under
Chiswick Bridge, passing a
fourth crew as we did so. The
whole crew was pretty quiet,
testament to the amount of
energy that had just drained
from of our bodies. Being a
head race we were none the
wiser as to how well we had
done, but it felt pretty good
and we were confident of giv-
ing a respectable account of
ourselves.
Wespuntheboatandstarted
the final leg of our 32km out-
ing back to Putney and more
familiar waters. I dare say
those final kilometres would
have felt all the more effort-
less had we of heard the
results being announced back
in Chiswick; we had clocked
the fastest time of the day!
Albeit only officially winning
the invitational category, we
couldn’t quite believe that
we had beaten every senior
boat on the water; it had been
talked about in the changing
room before hand but not put
forward as a serious possi-
bility! In a month that sees
all self-respecting boat clubs
building up for The Head of
the River in March, we really
couldn’t have asked for a bet-
ter confidence boost, and for
that matter reassurance that
the last three months of hard
winter training are coming
to fruition. We can only hope
that our success on the water
continues and that March 19
delivers the same feeling of
contentment when we strive
for the novice title on the
Tideway.
Thanks to Jo Hardwick
(ICSMBC Captain) and all
those involved in organising
the event for the invitation
and hospitality at UL on the
day; it was much appreci-
ated. Congratulations to the
ICSMBC novice boat on win-
ning the novice category.
