HSBC announces record profits
Kabir Merali has a close look at the £9bn+ profits of the massive multinational firm
HSBC announced record
profits for a UK company
on Monday with earnings of
£9.6bn over the past year. The
firm dethroned the record’s
previous owner, Shell, who
spent only weeks at the top
spot.
HSBC’s profit increase – up
37% from 2003 – comes at the
end of a month in which many
UK banks reported increased
earnings. The Royal Bank of
Scotland, the UK’s second
largest bank, made 14% more
money in 2004 than in 2003,
and Barclays announced a
20% increase in earnings for
the same year.
The profit of £9.6bn works
out at around £1m an hour.
Chairman Sir John Bond said
2004 was “another good year
for HSBC”.
Rip-off Britain?
But not everyone is happy
about this increase in profit.
Some argue that the recent
prosperity of UK banks marks
a return to “rip-off Britain,”
and that banks are benefit-
ting from excessive prices
and mark-ups on interest
rates.
But while banks do profit
from interest collected on
loans, the recent earning
increase can not be solely
attributed to heightened
interest rates.
Banks profit by loaning
money. They borrow it from
the general public, by get-
ting people to put their money
in bank accounts. They then
take this money and lend it to
people who need it, charge a
higher interest rate and pock-
et the difference. If they are
making more money, it must
mean that they are charg-
ing more interest, and creat-
ing a bigger gap between the
amount they give to savers
and the amount they charge
borrowers.
We are currently living in a
period of low interest rates,
which increases the number
of people who are able to
borrow money. Last July,
the amount owed on loans,
mortgages and credit cards
reached £1 trillion. Banks, in
turn, profit from this increase
in customers.
A large percentage of
HSBC’s profit is also generat-
ed overseas. Only 24% of the
HSBC’s earnings last year
came from the UK and a sig-
nificant amount of revenue
came from Household, the US
consumer lending firm HSBC
acquired in 2003.
HSBC Chairman Sir Bond
defended the profits: “We are
in 77 countries and our UK
profits are no different from
profits in other markets.”
The British Banker’s
Association said UK custom-
ers are “getting a good deal,”
and that banks are profiting
because of their size, not
because of increased fees.
“The return they get on the
capital needed to keep going
is 1%, which is not a huge
return,” a spokesperson said.
Consumers have, howev-
er, been complaining about
excessive charges, such
as late payment fees. Late
payment fees are supposed
to cover the cost of writing
customers letters, but many
see them as a cynical way of
boosting profits.
Credit card interest charg-
es are also very high, and
can often be many times the
Bank of England interest
rate. Some have complained
that the excessive rates are a
way of targeting the poor who
do not have a high enough
credit rating to borrow at the
standard rate.
Don Cruickshank, who
headed a Treasury backed
review of the banking indus-
try, said that many of the
problems consumers have
with the banking industry are
the same as they were five
years ago. Mr Cruickshank
cited improved customer
services and faster cheque
clearing as changes he would
like to see made.
Staff to strike?
The extra profit has not
found its way to the major-
ity of the company’s staff,
many of whom will not get
a pay rise.
Amicus, the trade union,
is balloting its members to
decide on strike action by
HSBC workers. They argue
that the increase in out-
sourcing, including the latest
announcement by HSBC that
they will be moving 2000 jobs
to India, makes a mockery
of the ‘World’s Local Bank’
motto that the company
adopts.
HSBC Towers: Did the size and magnificence of these buildings contribute to HSBC’s spectacular success?
“Consumers have
been complaining
about excessive
charges, such as
late payment fees”
“The profit of
£9.6bn works out
at around £1m
an hour”
