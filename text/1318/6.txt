Police state
Yesterday I attended a demonstra-
tion outside Bow Street Magistrates
Court to coincide with the start of
Babar Ahmad’s extradition hearing.
His family called for all support-
ers to attend. I am not a ‘lefty’ and
am not the ‘demonstrating’ sort,
yet I still think that his case and the
wider civil liberties issues it raises
are things we should be concerned
about.
If only to remind us of the climate
we now live in, the Government
rushed its ‘Prevention of Terrorism’
bill through Parliament this week.
Despite a rebellion amongst Labour
MPs, the second reading passed
through the House by 14 votes.
The provisions will grant the Home
Secretary powers to impose ‘control
orders’ on British citizens and oth-
ers who are legitimately resident
in the UK.
What are these control orders?
Well they include provisions for
house arrest, curfews and smart
tagging (where a chip is strapped
around your wrist or ankle so law
enforcement agencies can track
your movements). The Home
Secretary will also be able to con-
strain other liberties, such as being
able to ban you from using the tel-
ephone or internet.
The Home Secretary will be able
to impose any of these control
orders upon any of us without refer-
ence to a proper judicial process.
He can do so if he believes there
is enough ‘intelligence’ to believe
that you might commit a terrorist
act. You do not have the right to
know what is alleged about you or
the ability to see, let alone chal-
lenge, any evidence against you.
Crucially, you are not presumed
innocent until proven guilty in a
court of law.
This is the sort of assault on free-
dom that would make some ‘rogue
states’ proud. It’s the very sort of
thing we supposedly went to war in
Iraq to stamp out. The Government
claims it is doing all this to protect
us from terrorism. Yet all it is really
doing is allowing terrorism to claim
victory by abandoning judicial proc-
ess and attacking our freedoms.
London has a proud and lengthy
tradition of being a home from home
for political dissidents from across
the world. Political dissence is often
grounded in and around academia
because of the liberating power of
education. Imperial College should
rightly be a welcoming institution
for students and scholars from all
backgrounds, nationalities, beliefs
and affiliations. Intellectual dis-
course and the free flow of ideas
is essential in a civilised society.
It cannot and should not be con-
strained by political interference. In
the current political climate, more
extensive security vetting of sci-
ence and technology students, par-
ticularly those engaged in research,
is almost certain to appear on the
horizion. We must to be ready to
oppose it.
Security in halls
The College Security department
has approached us for help in get-
ting opinion on the service they
provide to students. I believe they
genuinely want to improve and offer
the best service they can. They can’t
do this without constructive feed-
back, however. I should be grate-
ful if anyone who wishes to make
comments would do so by emailing
president@ic.ac.uk with the subject
line ‘Security Feedback’. Your com-
ments will be treated in the strictest
of confidence, if requested, and will
help us to make things better.
Do you feel safe in halls? Do you
think security guards are conscien-
tious and sympathetic to your con-
cerns? There is no good reason why
you shouldn’t be able to answer yes
to these questions and with some
useful feedback we can hopefully
change things to ensure you do.
Bickering
Given some of the important issues
of the day, you could be forgiven for
wondering why Union Councillors
(and others) have been occupying
their time considering a motion of no
confidence against me. It is rather
disappointing when normally sensi-
ble, mature student representatives
get into a room together and for-
get why they are there. Point scor-
ing and pursuing personality-based
grievances can be fun for some of
those involved but isn’t really very
constructive in the greater scheme
of things.
One of the main protagonists
privately told me beforehand that
“there are only 200 or so students
who really care about the Union and
they are the ones you should focus
on”. Imperial College has 12,618
students and now, with the matter
closed, we should get on with serv-
ing all of you.
As Henry Kissinger, former US
Secretary of State, once said of his
days at Harvard, “student politics
is the most vicious kind there is…
precisely because the stakes are so
small and the fight so large.”
