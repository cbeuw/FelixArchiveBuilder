Greetings my monkey-loving
friends. This is my first and perhaps
my last cryptic crossword for Felix.
I like the idea of being something of
a one-hit wonder in the crossword
world. This week’s crossword has
a theme, but it is incredibly sub-
tle – essentially it is ‘what was in
my head when I was writing the
crossword’ – which means it will
be a voyage of self discovery for
you, through lesbian geography to
(reasonably obscure) literary refer-
ences.
This crossword is best solved
whilst listening to Lynyrd Skynyrd’s
Second Helping album (1974). Good
luck and play safe kids. Monkye

Issue 1317 solution
Imperial Men’s 2nd 24
Brighton Men’s 2nd 8
By Howard Harris
On a crisp February after-
noon, Imperial Seconds
turned up at Harlington to
play their final BUSA league
fixture.
Though little was left to
play for in the competition,
spirits were high and all
were keen to perform well in
preparation for the Varsity
match.
From the kick-off, Imperial
showed dominance in the
forwards and sustained a
good period of pressure in
the opponents half. Ten min-
utes in, after the referee had
made his intentions clear,
our number seven Gareth
“I’d rather watch from the
touch line” Coady was shown
a yellow card for repeated
dissent.
After some untidy play in
midfield by Brighton, the ball
fell to Rich Bishop and one
misplaced box kick into Alex
Baines-Buffery’s head sent
the Brighton number five on
a 30m dash for the Imperial
try line. Unfortunately he was
not stopped until after cross-
ing it, and we found ourselves
five points down.
Despite the setback,
Imperial continued to make
holes in the opposition back
line with our units that
are Quincy Alan and Ed
Poulding.
Towards the end of the half,
as a result of a crash ball,
Quincy ploughed into his
opposite number. There could
be only one winner. With the
Brightonian on the floor in
what seemed to be a slight
crater (with his shoulder dis-
located), the match paused
for a short while.
Play was resumed with a
penalty for Imperial on the
Brighton 10m line. Somehow
managed to find its way
from my boot to the flag on
the try line (touch in goal).
This put us on the back foot
momentarily, and we con-
ceded a penalty on our 22
which was swiftly dealt with.
Half time score: Imperial 0,
Brighton 8.
The second half went
much more to plan. With a
few changes in the backs,
notably the return of Kieran
at number ten, we pinned
Brighton in their half by their
ears!
It wasn’t long before Rich
‘Bish Bash’ Bishop was mak-
ing up for first half blunders.
Now playing on the wing, he
intercepted a wayward miss
pass and sauntered under the
posts.
With heads up, tempo
raised, and victory within our
grasp, Imperial scored again
from some beautiful running
from both backs and forwards.
This time the scorer was
none other than our beloved
captain Steve “I didn’t drop it
this time” Barham. Well done
Steve, we all knew you could
do it! A touchline conversion
from yours truly and we were
ahead 14-8.
Imperial were now unstop-
pable. A penalty and then
a try from Ed ‘all thighs’
Poulding (who was practi-
cally crowd-surfed over the
line) were enough to have
Brighton all wrapped up in
ribbons, but then again, I
guess they like that kind of
thing down there!
So it was a comfortable win
in the end, and a turnaround
of 80-odd points from when
we visited the Sussex-based
university last term.
