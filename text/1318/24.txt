Royal School of Mines
Men’s 1st 17
Camboune School of
Mines Men’s 1st 15
By Bebop and
Rocksteady
When it comes to varsity
matches, this is one of the old-
est, rawest, and most aggres-
sive one in the world. With
the Royal School of Mines
(RSM) team coming into the
match with an unbeaten sea-
son so far, and a team line
up that could rival England’s,
the players’ confidence was
high... very high.
The match started with a
turbulent whirlwind of fists
from the first ruck (mostly
from the Cambourne players)
meaning that Joe Albino was
probably going to be looking
like his second row chum
Panda-face, thus threatening
the RSM’s status as the best
looking team at Imperial.
The Cambourne School of
Mines (CSM) forwards played
well for the first five minutes
of the match, ensuring fast
ball for their backs, who were
unable to penetrate the RSM
defence. However, a sneaky
pick-up from the side of a
ruck allowed a ginger CSM
prop to trundle past winger
and captain Eddy Poulding to
score the first try of the day.
Just when the RSM team
thought their troubles were
over and were safely camped
in the opposition’s 22, the
CSM forwards hit the blind
and drove over the line to
score a second try.
RSM hit back and mounted
an attack using handsome
decoy backs out wide (Allan,
O’Rourke, Poulding and
maybe Towers depending on
your taste), allowing space
inside for fly half Jon Spencer
to thrust Raph Diguisto
through CSM like a hot kebab
knife through a juicy sha-
warma. Try converted, 10-7,
game on.
The fuming CSM players
decided to mount their last
attack of the afternoon, suck-
ing players into ruck after
ruck, then shipping the ball
out wide and capitalising on
an overlap to once again trun-
dle past the isolated Eddy P
and putting RSM in a difficult
position going into half time
15-7 behind.
An inspirational talk during
the break, fierce battle cries
from the crowds and a bit
of Alex Fergusson’s voodoo
magic ensured that the RSM
men went into the second half
with nothing but victory on
their minds.
RSM received the ball from
the kick-off, and immediately
