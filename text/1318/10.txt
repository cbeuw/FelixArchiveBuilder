Charity fashion show
By Henri Ozarovski
Many prominent designers were
on display at the annual Imperial
College charity fashion show, a must
for all fashion followers and trend-
setters. This year’s neoteric event
stemmed from an ongoing tradition
of munificence and charitable dona-
tion from family, friends and guests.
In this age of charity events that
raise very little, the event was organ-
ised on the premise that 100% of
the ticket price would be donated to
the chosen foundation. In this case,
the proceeds of the fashion show
were given to the Macmillan Cancer
Relief foundation.
Sponsorships came from Deloitte,
Creative Labs and Shell, while gift
bag assortments were provided by
Sephora and Sisley. Chic Zen MP3
players were up for grabs, as were
a trip to Morocco, signed Chelsea
shirts and a day trip to Paris cour-
tesy of Bombardier aerospace.
The Sketch Gallery, famous for its
elegance and exclusivity, was ideal
for the sophisticated young academ-
ic crowd that attended.
32 male and female student models
underwent a formidable transforma-
tion process to add elegance to the
defile. The choreography was put
together by head organiser, Natasha
Wiggins, a medical student who
dedicated the most part of her last
few months to the coordination and
preparation of the event.
The fashion show committee, con-
sisting of an eclectic mix of engi-
neers, scientists and medical stu-
dents, put great effort into the intri-
cate details of the show, from the gift
bags right through to the gift tree
envelopes. This ambitiously tena-
cious committee would not consider
good as an answer but rather perfec-
tion as a necessity.
Clothing lines included the trendy
makes Diesel 55, High Jinks, Pijja,
TM Lewin, Kew, Laundry Industry,
and So Shei, the more exclusive col-
lections from Harvey Nichols, Calvin
Klein, Formal Attire, Philipa Lepley,
and the avant-garde Voyage.
The theme of the event, “It’s only a
matter of time”, seemed appropriate
in its relevance because only with
sustained investment will a cure for
this widespread disease be found.
The show was split into two parts,
allowing guests to absorb the assort-
ed collections and the diversity of
themes.
The first collection, Freetime, was
based on urban streetwear but was
described as ‘simply offbeat’ and fus-
ing various cultural influences. The
next collection, Daytime, took formal
office wear as a starting point and
turned it into something clearly bet-
ter suited for the catwalk.
The first half ended with a section
entitled Playtime, which many of
the audience members seemed to
find the most captivating, although
this reporter cannot help but think
that those individuals’ attention was
focused less on what the models
were wearing than on what they
were not.
The second half commenced with
Sometimes, an impressively elegant
and graceful line of wedding dresses
designed by Philippa Lepley and
tuxedos from Formal Attire. This
was followed by Ourtime, designed
by Imperial’s students, and finally
Nighttime, where a selection of cock-
tail dresses and evening wear were
displayed.
The adorning finishing touches
included a diverse lighting scheme
for each line of clothing and a
well suited musical playlist which
included an assortment of neo and
retro sounds. From the well known
Baywatch theme song to Moloko or
the soothing tranquillity of Tracy
Chapman, the artists were specifi-
cally chosen to complement the vari-
ous clothing lines.
As important and sometimes for-
gotten are the indispensable back-
stage crew. Makeup artists and hair
stylists from Toni & Guy were com-
plementing the line-up of outfits,
whilst all committee staff members
were rushing around fixing loose
ends, dressing models and setting
the stage for each part of the show.
The show combined an unforget-
table evening with making a differ-
ence. Both doctors and scientists of
the future have collaborated to raise
money for a disease which requires
committed long term funding.
It would seem appropriate to end
this article by thanking those individ-
uals who sought to make this event
memorable and enjoyable for all.
The support and participation at
this year’s event will continue to
raise the fashion show’s profile for
years to come, and will ferment an
ongoing tradition of giving. Let us
continue this tradition and wish the
best of luck to future organisers of
the show.
