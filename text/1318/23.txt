asserted their authority,
with the forwards taking the
ball into contact phase after
phase, and with powerful run-
ning from the likes of Rich
‘the tallest man in the world’
Aung, Doug ‘one pint won-
der’ Higgins and Raph ‘the
Queen used to speak French’
Diguisto.
The ball then came wide
to Quincy ‘the biggest
name in IC’ who was pre-
sented with space, but due
to lack of selfishness was
unable to finish. Wave after
wave of RSM attacks then
ensured breaks similar to the
American attacks on Omaha
beach. Then, in a simple, yet
mesmerising move, DSP let
Alex ‘odd socks’ O’Rourke
penetrate through the CSM
and score. Try gracefully con-
verted by Spencer, 15-14 to
CSM, ooh...
More attacking pressure
from the backs and superb
rucking and mauling from
Pooh Bear, Albino and Josh
forced CSM to cheat out of
sheer frustration, allowing
man of the match Spencer
to put RSM in the lead, 17-15,
with 35 minutes to play.
CSM tested the RSM
back three by kicking deep,
but the adhesive hands of
Telfon Towers, El Capitan
and fresher superstar Rob
Phillipps quashed any hopes
of a kicking game for the
CSM, who then switched to
DEFCON 2 – the running
game. However, the RSM
were already on DEFCON
5...
The RSM team secured
the match by winning 99% of
line-out ball thanks to accu-
rate throwing from Luke
‘the power’ Taylor, Rich ‘too
tall’ Aung, and Steve ‘Panda
Face’. Special mention should
also go to Rob Robinson, who,
although playing scrum half,
seemed to think it would be
more productive for him to
attempt drop kicks from the
wing. But, to his credit, he did
make an 80 yard break and
score what would have been
the try of the match, if he had
scored.
Game over, Bottle retained
for the ninth time. See you
CSM suckers next year!

Franklin, Luke Taylor, Rich

RSM 3
CSM 2
Expectations were low for the
squash as no-one can pre-
cisely remember when we
last won it.
This year we had a fully fit
team (with no broken limbs)
to contest this important
match, although upon arrival
things were not looking great
with one player short and one
player missing. But a stroke
of luck had occurred a few
hours before, as Nigel, who
had turned up to play for CSM
as a former student of the
god-awful hole and was now
a RSM MSc student, was not
required by CSM and would
play for his new home.
The other reluctant stand-
in was caught lurking in the
halls: Terrence, also an RSM
student. So the battle lines
were drawn.
Camborne supporters
outnumbered RSM 4-1, but
this wasn’t to be the result.
Terrence lost in straight sets
but captain Tom Hawkins
demolished his opponent.
Newly acquired RSM student
Nigel was to deliver a crush-
ing blow to Camborne, beat-
ing them 9-1 9-4 to remind
them of what they had lost.
With two games left, vic-
tory in either would bring
triumph, but unfortunately
Rob Thomas was beaten in
a last second tie-breaker. Up
stepped George Hutson, who,
despite the pressure, crushed
his opponent like an ant under
a stampede of zebras. Victory
was RSM’s, and the quality
squash team T-shirts made
by Tom added insult to the
ragamuffin CSM squad.
RSM Women 1
CSM Women 4

The day started in a sleepy
state at 8am, sitting on a
coach outside the RSM wait-
ing for our 13th player to turn
up (maybe that was an omen
for later). We eventually had
to set off late without her.
Stepping off the coach at
Harlington was a definite
wake-up call – stepping out
to the cold, realising what we
were letting ourselves in for.
Camborne were already there
posing for team photos so we
didn’t have time to do a full
warm-up, let alone practice.
A quick group huddle and the
game was underway.
Camborne started strongly
but we matched them in pace
and skill. Some tight defend-
ing prevented Camborne
scoring early on, but they
finally broke the seal five
minutes later by putting one
neatly past Suzie in goal.
The Camborne cheers
only spurred on the RSM
further and soon the play
was mostly up at their end.
The accurate passing from
Susie and Heather in midfield
allowed some superb running
up the wings by Roxy and
Amanda. The continued pres-
sure allowed a pass to the
unmarked Alice who belted
the ball into the corner of the
net. 1-1.
The game carried on with
the same high speed flare to
half time with Sarah ‘please
put me on the subs bench’
Collins running around con-
fusing their midfield and
Sarah ‘everywhere’ Conolly
appearing all over the place.
I have never seen someone
run around so much (and it
wasn’t even 10am!)
Unfortunately the speed
of the game in the first half
had taken its toll on the RSM
team whilst CSM replaced
half their team with the five
subs they had brought with
them. We started the sec-
ond half defending a short in
which our centre back, Sara,
who had come to play despite
an injury and had produced
some fine stops and clear-
ances in the first half, got
injured.
Gemma, who was half fro-
zen on the sidelines, came
on to replace Sara and the
defence had a reshuffle.
Camborne took advantage
and put away two quick goals
as the RSM adjusted. Some
good defensive play by Gilly,
Gemma, Rachel and Suzie in
goalstoppedfurtherattempts.
Camborne caught us on the
break and also caught my
foot with the ball (then the
stick – I later had to make a
trip to A&E), and managed to
convert the subsequent short
corner into a goal. A final
goal was disallowed despite
Camborne’s protests that the
umpire needed glasses.
The game ended 4-1 to CSM
but RSM played with deter-
mination and flare. The game
saw some excellent passing
and play from the RSM team
with Sarah Connolly winning
the ‘man of the match’ award
for her presence absolutely
everywhere on the pitch.
A good time was had by all
and we can’t wait to turn the
result around at Camborne
next year.
RSM Men 1
CSM Men 3
By Peter Jackson
Encouragedbythestrong(but
slightly unlucky) perform-
ance from the RSM women’s
hockey players immediately
prior to our game, the RSM
men took to the pitch intent
on hitting back at Camborne.
However, for a long while
into the first half the two
teams remained deadlocked,
equalling each other in mid-
field. The best early RSM
chance came when Simon
Pike took a hit from a short
corner demanding a goal
line clearance from the CSM
defenders.
It was the CSM team who
scored first, about midway
through the first half. After
RSM failed to clear their lines
the CSM number nine pro-
duced a good (but not great)
finish from close on goal.
RSM heads did not drop
after going behind; Mike
Pettit, Tom Diaper and Sam
Lloyd all continued to play
very well in midfield and it
looked like the score would
stay 1-0 into half time. But
just before half time came,
the CSM forwards reacted
quickest to a ball rebounding
back off our post and the RSM
were 2-0 down at the break.
It was clear that if RSM
were going to get back in the
game they were going to have
to push men forward and so
they came out for the second
half on the attack.
The change in mentality
paid off when shortly into
the second period Martin
(Stanners) Stanley produced
a very neat finish, silencing
the Camborne fans mid-song
and pulling the RSM back
into the match.
However, with more people
committed forward, pushing
for the equaliser, the RSM
back line became exposed
and CSM stole another goal,
from which RSM could not
recover.
The final score on the day
was 3-1. The best RSM per-
formance was produced by
our central defender Tony
Stocks. We would like to thank
everyone who turned out to
support us.

“We can have this boys... do
it, just imagine what it will
be like at the players din-
ner if we lose this game”.
For some of the RSM football
veterans, it wasn’t a case of
imagining, but remembering
the 2002 Bottle match where
Camborne won 5-2.
It was now the responsibil-
ity of John Eudall to make
sure the cup stayed in SW7
for a second successive glori-
ous year.
There were six players
with Bottle match experi-
ence. They knew what was
required to win, they knew
how tough the game would be
and soon reminded the debu-
tants that this would be the
hardest game of the year.
The game started brightly
with RSM playing a classic 4-
4-2 formation and Camborne
starting with a Jose (stifle the
life out of football) Mourinho
style 4-5-1.
Camborne got the first goal
against the run of play, but
making life difficult for our-
selves had become a recur-
ring theme. Soon, however,
we were back on level terms
with a period of pressure
resulting in an own goal.
The Camborne midfield
was starting to function like
a well oiled Cornish combine
harvester and soon the extra
man took it toll. RSM con-
ceded two goals in a short
space of time and suddenly
the cup was slipping from our
grasp.
Half time came and so
did the inspiration. A free
kick on the Camborne left
was whipped in and Carlos,
who was player of the sea-
son and flown specially back
from Portugal for the game,
powered a header past the
Camborne keeper.
Fear crept into Camborne
like a thief in the night. RSM
started to dominate and the
whole team from Rob in goal
with his confidence-exuding
persona to Alex Hombre who
was holding the ball up well
and feeding the other attack-
ing players. From a corner,
Ewan headed from close
range and in a controversial
incident the ball was adjudged
to have crossed the line by
the referee. The Geoff Hurst
goal in 1966 looked more obvi-
ous. We didn’t care... we were
level and playing exhibition
football.
From there, not even dodgy
linesmans calls could stop
us. One through ball, which
reached Alex, bounced per-
fectly for him to lob their tiny
‘keeper from 25 yards. This
lead to a mini pitch invasion
from Ed Turner and Kirk
(there will probably be a FA
investigation).
RSM were in the lead and
that wasn’t going to change.
The crowd got louder,
the passing got better and
Camborne looked dejected.
On the counter attack with
Camborne desperately trying
to get back in the game, Rich
Gibson curled a beauty from
distance to seal the win.
After the sporting festivities,
the teams and supporters
proceeded to Lorenzo’s for
an all-you-can-eat buffet.
The night ended with eve-
ryone happy, the Bottle safely
back in the RSM (Union)
Bar for another year, and
generally the gentlefolk of
the RSM looking forward to
another trip to Camborne
next year!
