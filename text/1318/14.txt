LIVE REVIEW
There are many reasons why we
choose the shows we do. First, it
helps to be a fan of the music. In
the case of The Kills that’s easy. VV
(aka Alison Mosshart) and Hotel
(aka Jamie Hince) with their per-
verse, raw, hard guitar rock are,
quite simply, one heck of a duo. A
second reason is that it can make
someone (such as a sweetheart)
really jealous. Because when that
someone likes a band and just can’t
make the gig, well, the promise of
teasing them afterwards brings a
sense of added deliciousness to any
evening. So when a calling card for
a night with The Kills unexpect-
edly came my way, I was on my bike
bound for Camden Town quicker
than you could say “a venue full of
guys and gals with heavy rock‘n’roll
fringes and eighties boots”.
From the opening songs there
was a sense that The Kills were
there to show off their immense tal-
ent. Guitar, vocals and a backstage
drum machine created an onslaught
of sound. Willowy VV oozed rock
chic coolness in jeans, an oversized
T-shirt and military style jacket. The
wide-eyed and gangly Londoner,
Hotel, lent the event a sense of
purpose in his collared black shirt.
VV’s dark, waist-length, straight-as-
death hair engulfed the microphone
while her body tossed and tumbled
with each of Hotel’s rifts. She was
like a puppet on crazed musical
strings. She paced the stage in little
circles before each song, psyching
herself up to wow the audience with
her dark, sexy drawl.
Mostly the songs were taken from
the debut album Keep On Your
Mean Side, although their new sin-
gle, The Good Ones, was bound to
have been in there somewhere (if
only I recognised it).
The first set was short. The high-
light was the last song, Kissy Kissy,
a slower, almost Paris Texas-like
sounding number where VV also
adopted a guitar. It had a strong
element of ‘being in the bedroom’
about it as they drew close and
locked their instruments in sen-
sual conversation (even the drum
machine’s heart skipped a beat).
Their second set began with Wait,
VV’s voice resplendent as the sad
lyrics wafted over the audience:
“Tell me what you done t’ yourself
/ I would like to know / Write it on
the rocks and then tell me where
to go / Why you say wait?” The
heavier Fuck The People and Fried
My Little Brains were also audi-
ence favourites.
Certainly the Kills kept up their
air of mystery throughout, VV only
once speaking to us to welcome
in the Chinese New Year before
launching into Black Rooster (the
‘in the basement’ song for those
unfamiliar with intricacies). It is the
year of the rooster. A nice touch,
VV.
The venue also suited the mood.
The velvet wallpaper and the cool
black and white terrazzo tiles of
the upstairs Electric matched them
perfectly. The set ended with The
Kills writhing on the floor and then,
afflicted with a sudden attack of
Wednesdayitis, there was a mass
and unacceptable exodus. Stop!
More foot stamping required please!
But it was not to be.
I guess comparison with the
White Stripes is inevitable. Indeed,
they are of the same genre: girl-boy
and bass-free. I suppose someone
had to come first. But like all good
Westerns, The Kills have their own
little twists. For a start, they are
certainly less colour-sensitive than
Jack and Meg, but they are also
bluesier and a bit more primal.
And I was the first of us to see
them play live. But that’s just rub-
bing it in. Zoë Corbyn
LIVE REVIEW
Math-rock! The genre (with its
silly name) is often associated with
impenetrably complex time signa-
tures, stop-start rhythms and split-
ting headaches as a result of both.
However, the migraine is only a
result of the fact that your meagre
brain cannot fully comprehend the
wonder of music that refuses to be
predictable, derivative and, worst of
all, nice. Anyone who finds the new
Kaiser Chiefs album or Kasabian
song structures perplexing, be
ready to evacuate your bowels. This
is not another Killers gig; This is
something special: a line-up that’s
diverse yet makes amazing, coher-
ent sense.
Redjetson (DrownedinSound’s
new darlings) make very pretty
music. They infuse Manchester mel-
ancholia (think Joy Division, Closer)
with F#A#(Infinity)-era Godspeed
You Black Emperor apocalyptic gui-
tars. This may seem remarkably
snobbish and indie, but you can-
not doubt how powerful said bands’
music can be.
As perfect this combination
of styles may be, something still
doesn’t feel right. The swooning
vocals occasionally overshadow the
prettiness of the music, and the illu-
sion of being in a more glorious
place than Bloomsbury is shattered.
However, they set the scene per-
fectly for YMSS.
After being sedated by Redjetson,
YMSS take the stage and launch into
A little late he staggered through
the doors and into her eyes (who
said post-rock titles were dead?).
It is difficult to resist sporadic,
awkward motion when being soni-
cally assaulted by these twitching
rhythms. Yes, I am getting into the
swing of all things post-rock by using
a thesaurus. While this song is flat
on record, it becomes pure anthem
to those disaffected by conventional
music live, so much so that during
an a cappella moment the audience
takes over whilst the band take a
breather.
If Works makes you wonder how
anyone ever got away with the quiet
verse, loud chorus agenda for more
than a decade without ever wanting
to expand on such a tired, raped of
life structure. Finally, as if I haven’t
been sycophantic enough, they fin-
ish with …Spooks The Horse and
express what for most bands is a
life’s worth of ambition in eight and
a half minutes. This made my heart
want to burst out of my ribcage and
my head implode leaving a horrible
mess for the already dismal ULU
student staff to clear up. I restrained
myself.
Next to pick up the pieces of my
already decimated senses and muti-
late them some more were the ever
wonderful 65*daysofstatic. Anyone
who denies the power of Retreat!
Retreat! really needs to remove the
pen that you stuck up your nose for
a laugh when you were 16 and get
your earwax removed. As soon as
the soundbite, “You will not retreat,
this band is unstoppable!” appears,
you try to hold your breath wait-
ing for the inevitable ear-crushing
bliss, but you can’t help but lose
control.
By the way, I apologise to the
University of London Union staff
for my ‘mishaps’. I can’t prom-
ise it won’t happen again, but
I will wear continence pads. The
brilliance of 65*daysofstatic is the
fact that they combine electronic
beats and samples with live instru-
mentation flawlessly. You have to
give up working out who is play-
ing what and justdo what the band
want you to do: focus on the music.
When certain bands want you to
focus on the music to detract from
their blatant ugliness, 65*daysof-
static just know that with music
this demanding there is no time for
image. Something exciting is hap-
pening. This gig is testament to that,
migraine or no migraine.
