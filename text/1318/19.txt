When you think of Adam Sandler
and the word Spanglish, you might
think it’s a movie filled with goofy
clichéd jokes about language and
cultural barriers, but it is nothing
like that.
The story is viewed through the
perspective of a young Spanish girl,
Christina (Victoria Luna), whose
father left her family when she
was very young. Her mother, Flor
(Paz Vega), decides to uproot
the family and move to America.
Despite the move, Christina and
Flor’s social circles remain restrict-
ed to the small Spanish popula-
tion in Los Angeles until Christina
reaches puberty and Flor decides
to work for a local American family,
the Claskys.
The Claskys are a wealthy family
that is far from perfect. John Clasky
(Adam Sandler) is a well-known chef
who owns a profitable restaurant
and his wife, Deborah (Téa Leoni),
is a neurotic, insecure and tactless
woman. They have two children:
Bernice, who, despite her lovable
personality, has weight problems,
and Georgie. Deborah’s mother is
an alcoholic whose head remains
lost in her not-too-glamorous past
as a jazz singer.
Initially, Flor has no intention of
learning English as she has no rea-
son to intervene in the Claskys’s
lives. However, upon witnessing
Deborah’s tactlessness and insen-
sitivity in handling Bernice’s weight
problems, Flor decides to learn
English in order to help the Claskys.
When summer comes, the Claskys
ask Flor to move with them to their
summer home. Flor is hesitant
at first, as she will be required to
bring Christina along, but she
relents in the interest of keeping
her job.
This decision soon proves to be
a grievous mistake. Upon enter-
ing the Claskys’ home, Deborah
takes Christina under her wing as
Christina is the pretty and charm-
ing daughter that Bernice is not.
Christina is gradually seduced into
the locals’ way of life and drifts fur-
ther away from Flor. Flor, distressed
by the fact that she might lose her
only daughter, finds an understand-
ing and sympathetic ear in John
Clasky.
Flor is drawn to John, as she has
never met a man who could under-
stand her. Similarly, John is drawn
to Flor, who is everything his wife is
not. It seems Flor’s problems with
her daughter will remain under the
water until Christina dismisses a
party her mum organized to attend
a slumber party at the Claskys.
Everything boils over and Flor and
John finally attain the lucky break
they need for their mutual attraction
to develop.
Spanglish is not just a simple
mother-daughter story. It is a movie
that explores the feelings of immi-
grants in a foreign land. It is also a
movie which challenges the individu-
al to hold on to one’s identity instead
of assimilating with the crowd. One
thing that I found particularly admi-
rable about the plot is its ability
to stay neutral without favouring
any particular culture. Secondly, the
movie manages to avoid becoming a
Hallmark film by revolving around
Flo and John who are emotionally
strong and do not give in to emo-
tional theatrics.
Adam Sandler and Téa Leoni
might be the household names on
the casting list, but it is truly Paz
Vega’s acting skills that blow you
away. Despite the introduction of
a sweet and believable chemistry
between Flo and John, it has no
real impact on the story except to
emphasize Flo’s dedication to her
daughter. Paz Vega makes an excel-
lent and convincing performance as
a beautiful and strong woman who
dares to stand up for her own beliefs
despite her misfortune.
Overall, Spanglish is a thoughtful
movie. Its unique ability to remain
neutral and to avoid becoming a typ-
ical tear-jerker is admirable; how-
ever, its predictable storyline and its
unnecessary additions downplay its
true potential. It’s alright to watch
it if you have some free time on
your hands, but if it was Spanglish
humour you were after, steer clear
and don’t say you have not been
warned. Angela Yuen Lee

Weird, really bloody weird. I’ve
never seen anything like it, and, yet,
its really good, but I’m not really
sure why. It’s probably because its
really weird. Now there’s a circular
argument!
The film follows the adventures
of Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), an
explorer and filmmaker desperate-
ly clinging onto remnants of fame
and credibility. The film opens with
Zissou presenting his latest docu-
mentary, in which his best friend
is eaten by a tiger shark, to critics
in Italy. During the post-film Q&A,
Zissou is asked the scientific rele-
vance of his next film, the capture of
the offending shark. Zissou’s dead-
pan reply: “revenge.”
The film explores Zissou’s mid-life
worries of inadequacies and waning
sex appeal, but in a more appealing
setting than the standard male mid-
life crisis film.
Although mostly comedic, there
are some heart rendering moments,
but they pass so quickly into the biza-
rely comic that you don’t have time
to appreciate their meaning. For
instance, Zissou’s long estranged
son, Ned (Owen Wilson), asks him:
“Why didn’t you contact me?” Zissou
replies: “Because I hate fathers and
I never wanted to be one.”
Other members of the motley
crew include defacto-son (Willem
Dafoe), who is displaced when Ned
and a pregnant British journalist
(Cate Blancett), whose cover story
resents Zissou’s last hope at mainta-
ing credibility, appear. Once aboard
The Belfonte, they don red skull
caps and blue speedos and do battle
with sharks and filipino pirates.
How could anybody think up this
story? I hear you cry. Well, sur-
prisingly enough it’s based on the
life of oceanographer, Jacques-
Yves Cousteau, who was perhaps
the ocean’s David Attenborough.
Although he too led a some what
eccentric life, one wonders if his
relatives will feel tarnished by this
film.
The bizarre is what really makes
this movie. Highly coloured stop-
motion animations of wacky marine
creatures, a navigations officer
topless for no discernible reason
and David Bowie songs sung in
Portuguese by the actor who played
Knockout Ned in City of God are
just a few examples of the film’s
crazy happenings. Rupert Neate
