President survives
confidence vote
By Dave Edwards
Editor
Mustafa Arif, President of
Imperial College Union, com-
fortably survived a vote of no
confidence at an emergency
Union Council meeting on
Tuesday evening.
Mr Arif, who brought a simi-
lar vote upon himself earlier
in the year by offering his res-
ignation and then changing
his mind, was one of 24 out of
35 Council members to vote
against the motion calling for
his dismissal.
It was alleged that Mr Arif
was guilty of bad manage-
ment, intimidation, a lack of
communication, and steam-
rollering through various
high-level changes without
the approval of the relevant
committees.
The motion of no confidence
was proposed by Tom Tibbits,
a postgraduate in the physics
department, and seconded
by, amongst others, former
Deputy President (Education
and Welfare) Katherine
McGinn and former Council
Chair Oliver Pell. In a let-
ter accompanying it, the pro-
poser wrote: “We are very
concerned with the current
style of management and
prevailing atmosphere in our
students’ union”.
Mr Tibbits began the meet-
ing by asking: “Do you want
a Union run by people who
ignore your concerns?”
In a long speech in response
to the motion, Mr Arif used the
word ‘sorry’ on at least eight
occasions. He said he agreed
with some of the concerns
raised and would work to
resolve them. He concluded:
“I’m doing my best to serve
you. If we stick together, we
can move forward together.”
Colin Smith, the Union’s
Welfare Campaigns Officer,
asked for Mr Arif to resign
before the vote took place. Mr
Arif responded: “I don’t see a
reason for me to resign”.
Ms McGinn told the meet-
ing: “Working with Mustafa,
one of the most infuriating
things to deal with was the
lack of communication within
the sabbatical team itself.
He was terrible at informing
people about what was going
on.”
Deputy Presidents Richard
Walker and Sam Rorke
defended Mr Arif, referring to
his recent success in obtain-
ing a record high election
turnout and the fact that he
had been elected as President
twice by hundreds of student
voters.
Finally, Mr Tibbits him-
self attempted to change the
motion to one of censure (an
official rebuke) instead of dis-
missal, but this was rejected
by the Council. With even its
proposer voting against it,
the motion now stood little
chance of being passed by the
required two thirds majority.
After almost three hours of
deliberation, the President
remained in post when only
eight members voted in
favour of dismissing him.

Union protests as former student
faces extradition hearing
By Dave Edwards
Lawyers will attempt to extra-
dite a former Imperial College
student and staff member
under new terrorism legisla-
tion at a court hearing today.
Babar Ahmad’s case is the
first to be heard under the
Extradition Act 2003, which
allows British citizens to be
extradited to the US without
the need for any evidence
to be provided and without
the accused being given any
chance to respond to the alle-
gations.
Mr Ahmad stands accused
of running websites for for-
eign terrorist organisations
and providing information
about potential new recruits.
A delegation from
Imperial College Union were
present outside Bow Street
Magistrates Court yester-
day for the first part of the
two-day hearing. The Union
passed policy to campaign
for Mr Ahmad’s release last
December.
Ashfaq Ahmad, Babar’s
father, spoke to Felix on
Monday: “It’s very important
for us that he is tried here
in the UK. I worry about the
abuse of human rights in the
US, especially at Guantanamo
Bay.
“We are talking about some-
one’s life here. I am absolute-
ly confident that Babar hasn’t
done anything wrong. This is
very unfair and it has turned
all our lives upside down.”
Mustafa Arif, President of
Imperial College Union, said:
“The Extradition Act under-
mines our own judicial sys-
tem, meaning that our legal
processes can be abused.
US prosecutors don’t need to
provide any evidence. This is
why the general principles of
this case are important.”
If the court decides that Mr
Ahmad should be extradited,
his family and supporters
plan to launch an appeal.
