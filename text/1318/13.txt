Most people think that poker
is a form of gambling. They’re
wrong. Roulette is gambling,
blackjack is gambling, but the
best poker players act on rea-
son and instinct developed
through experience – they
never purely gamble.
To play poker, you need
skill, insight and natural abil-
ity. You have to know how
to make decisions, improvise
and adapt to the environ-
ment. When things are not
going your way, you have to
roll with it, and not go ‘on
tilt’ (start throwing in money
erratically). OK, a little bit of
luck doesn’t go amiss either.
The ICU Poker Society
has already held some huge
events this year, including a
VC student poker champion-
ship where entrants were
each given £5 of free money
to play with. The winner on
that day was Zakir Burkit,
who walked away with the
top prize of a very cool £100
and a seat in the VC Grand
Final in June where there is
£25,000 up for grabs – enough
to pay off his student loan
twice over. In actual fact I
happen to know he’s planning
to buy a Lexus.
Got your attention? Next
Thursdayevening(10 March),
the Poker Society will be
holding a massive poker
extravaganza, FREE for
all students. The event will
involve professional dealers
and will have tables special-
ly shipped in. The event is
geared towards players of all
levels and the dealers will be
showing newcomers how to
enjoy playing poker. There
will also be a ‘play money’
(fake money) tournament
later so you can test out your
newly discovered skills.
Aside from all the corporate
sponsored events, the Poker
Society also holds weekly ses-
sions on Thursdays at 6pm
where students can come
along and play for enjoyment
and prizes. Beginners can
quickly learn the basics and
join in the fun.
In April, a team from the
Poker Society will be head-
ing to St Andrews to take
part in the UK Student
Poker Championships. Adam
Latimer, Neel Savani, Rob
Glasspool, Saurabh Pandya
and myself will be represent-
ing the College against a field
of over 200 poker players from
across the country.
Poker is really good fun
and allows you to flex those
mental muscles slightly more
than other pastimes like play-
ing Nintendo or sheep-shear-
ing. So come along to the JCR
next Thursday and find out
what all the fuss is about.

Straight flush: the best five card hand in poker

On Saturday 19 February,
three of the most powerful
teams in the world (Team
America, Team Rocket and
the A Team), helped by the
Illuminati (committee mem-
bers) and three Guests of
Honour, invaded and took
over Imperial College Union,
devoting their day to random-
ness and fun.
The Imperial College
Science Fiction, Fantasy and
Horror Society (ICSF) held its
annual convention, Picocon
22, and it was a total success,
thanks to our Picocon Sofa,
Ali Ryan, and all the effort he
put into organising it. As our
Sofa says, “the convention
went smoothly [considering
our first didn’t interviewer
arrive on time]. I think eve-
ryone had a good time and
we managed to raise a fair
amount for charity”. Picocon
was visited by more than 120
people nationwide, includ-
ing some from Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
Picocon opened its doors
at 10am, as promised, thanks
to the effort of the Illuminati,
who got there at 8am to set
up. As attendants were arriv-
ing, they got sorted into teams
(the above mentioned). Only
one team could win by the
end of the day, and its mem-
bers could earn points by
bringing ‘things’ to the front
desk. These ‘things’ included
everything from former ICSF
Chairs or published authors
to origami pieces and tickets
from Mornington Crescent.
The bonus token was bring-
ing Excalibur, for which the
Kingdom “on” England was
awarded. Team Rocket was
the winner of the day, by a fair
amount of points (too many
ex-Chairs ended up in this
team).
One of the best moments
of the day was, undoubtedly,
the Destruction of Dodgy
Merchandise (DoDM). The
auction was lead by one of
the ICSF ex-chairs, and the
tools provided were a ham-
mer, a rubber bonker, bolt
cutters and lots and lots of
liquid nitrogen. The high-
lights of the auction were
the Spirit of Obi Wan, the
LoTR Goblet of Greed, Wind-
up Legolas and, last but not
least, William Shatner’s video
Mysteries of the Gods which,
alone, went for £45. Sadly, it
was not destroyed. It is now
in David Weir’s possession.
If anybody sees it, you are
allowed to retrieve it by any
means and bring it back to
the ICSF library, where it will
be disposed of properly. The
total raised by the DoDM was
over £165, with all proceeds
going to RAG.
The central events of the
day were the authors’ talks,
running from the morning all
the way through the after-
noon. Two of our authors had
topics to their talks: Gwyneth
Jones on Insanity, and Brian
Stableford on the Myth of
the Space Age, while Jon
Courtenay Grimwood had a
Q&A session about his books.
Finally, the three of them took
part in a panel discussion,
where they discussed differ-
ent aspects of science fiction.
Both the talks and the panel
discussion were a success,
the attendance being very
high.
Afterwards, to balance seri-
ous discussion with inanity,
the Ministry of Silly Games
took place, run by Dave
Clements. Members from
each of the teams took part,
in a desperate attempt to win
the last points and snatch
victory off Team Rocket’s
hands (which, of course,
didn’t happen). The fact that
Dave, awarding the points,
belonged to Team Rocket
has nothing to do with this...
The players lived up to eve-
rybody’s expectations, excel-
ling at Mornington Crescent,
Charades and Just a Minute.
While all these events were
happening around the Union
building, dB’s was a continu-
ous event of games and books
from opening to closing time.
We had two book stalls from
two of our favourite book-
sellers, Fantasy Centre and
Porcupine Books. They are
some of our stronger sup-
porters, having come to many
Picocons! Several games
were running throughout
the day, including a non-stop
multiplayer UT2004 and oth-
ers, such as Munchkin, Magic
and Pirates of the Spanish
Main.
However, at 5.30pm, some-
thing out of the ordinary hap-
pened. Two men, represent-
ing the noble universities of
Cambrigde and Imperial, met
in the Quad to defend the
honour of their societies by
means of the ancient tradi-
tion of fish duelling. Dressed
in black and protected by
chain mail, both men fought,
with two fish each, to the
death or to the best of seven
blows. Oxford brought shame
upon themselves by failing to
present a champion. Sadly,
the Imperial champion lost to
Cambridge, but lost with hon-
our, and managed to get fish
guts on his opponent’s face.
Even so, the Fish Duel Trophy
will be sent to Cambridge,
until we can retrieve it next
year.
To round off the day, Picocon
ended with the Grand Quiz.
Ten brave teams faced a furi-
ous barrage of questions in
ten rounds, with a variety of
results. Special mention goes
to the Wye team that, well,
tried. Surprisingly enough,
the winners of the quiz
were the team ‘Authors and
Mooks’, formed by our guests
of honour (because some of
the questions were not about
their books, of course not)
and their ‘babysitters’.
Something new this year
was the constant presence of
a filming team, putting togeth-
er a documentary on fan-run
conventions, both from the
point of view of the organisers
and the attendants. Coming
soon to a theatre near you.
Almost.
We hope that everybody
who attended Picocon had
a great time. See you there
next year!
The Imperial College Union
Science Fiction library can be
found in the West Basement
(Beit Quad) and is open
between 12 and 2pm on week-
days.
