Grossing some $22 million in the
first week alone, Hide and Seek
looked like a film that just had to be
watched. It boasted a twist that was
so well guarded it virtually became
a matter of national security.
But either our American coun-
terparts are easily pleased or the
hype was really big, because Hide
and Seek is in fact an unimpressive,
poorly-made psychological thriller,
whose well-guarded twist turned out
to be conventional and predictable.
Robert de Niro stars as David
Callaway, a New York psycholo-
gist whose wife commits suicide.
Wanting a fresh start for himself and
his daughter, he chooses to move
to the country. The small country
neighbourhood is enough to drive
any sane person mad and, to top
it all off, David starts his new life
in a typical horror film house com-
plete with creaking floorboards, sur-
rounding woods with a ghostly lake,
dark cupboards, and a basement
that resembles a torture chamber.
Anyone can tell that this is the type
of house where unpleasant things
happen, and it doesn’t take long
for it to fulfil its potential. Once in
the house, David’s daughter Emily
(Dakota Fanning) invents an imag-
inary friend named Charlie, who
seems harmless enough at first.
David even encourages Emily to
vent her anger and grief by express-
ing her emotions through her imagi-
nary friend, but things take a nasty
turn when Charlie appears to be
making Emily do increasingly grue-
some and disturbing things: red
graffiti on bathroom walls, a dead
cat and serious doll mutilation are
a few examples. The race is on
to find out who – or indeed what
– Charlie is before one of their lives
is at stake.
Since this film is a thriller, I can’t
reveal the twist in the plot; how-
ever, it has been done before, and
it has certainly been done better.
The main problem is that the twist
was revealed too early, making a
quick and slick ending the next logi-
cal step. Instead, however, the twist
revealation is followed by a disap-
pointing and pathetic climax, with
a pointless chase scene through the
house and the surrounding woods.
The entire last 25 minutes saw the
film’s twist – which originally did
have some promise – dissolve into
a complete farce, leaving the audi-
ence feeling cheated.
The plot contains a plethora of
red herrings that are all equally
pointless and serve to add yet more
minutes to the already overdrawn
film. There are creepy neighbours
consisting of an intense husband
and a haunted wife, an estate agent
who keeps odd hours, a sheriff who
has the keys to every house in the
neighbourhood and a mysterious-
looking cave in the woods. These
sub-plots, which were not properly
explained, did nothing to help the
story and only created a sense of
discontinuity.
Plot aside, the acting was unim-
pressive apart from Dakota
Fanning’s stunning portrayal of
Emily. A lot is asked of her in this
film. Her acting has to vary from
being macabre to innocent to tor-
tured to afraid, and she delivers
each emotion flawlessly and to an
amazing standard. In fact, Fanning
shows up Robert de Niro, who fared
far better as the comical ex-CIA
agent father in Meet the Fockers.
Overall, this film is definitely one
you should miss. If you are looking
for something frightening, you will
not get it here unless a few cheap
shots of things like a cat jumping out
of a cupboard can make you scream.
I recommend you stay in hiding and
certainly don’t seek out this medio-
cre thriller.

Dakota Fanning: fast gaining one of the best reputations in Hollywood
The true-life story of Paul Rusesabagina
Let’s set the scene: 11 years ago in
Rwanda, Hutu extremists slaugh-
tered almost a million of their Tutsi
countrymen with guns and machet-
es. Many of you will remember the
horrific images that were broadcast
on the news back in 1994 and the
subsequent documentaries that fol-
lowed. The Western world stood by
and refused to do anything – which
sounds familiar.
Hotel Rwanda is probably one of
the first films to tackle the sub-
ject and follows the story of hotel
manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don
Cheadle), who ended up sheltering
and saving more than 1200 people
during the massacre.
The Rwandan genocide itself is
such a brutal and heart-wrenching
subject that any attempt to turn it
into entertainment would risk insult-
ing both the dead and the survivors.
It’s not surprising then that Terry
George has chosen to focus on one
man’s experience in Rwanda. Not
original, I know, but he deals with
it in such a way that it doesn’t fall
into the clichéd movie territory it
easily could have. It may get com-
pared to Schindler’s List, and I can
see the similarities in that both are
about one man who saves a large
number of lives, but Hotel Rwanda
is far more gritty and real. You can’t
escape the reality in either film, but
in this one you can’t hide behind
the beautiful cinematography of
Schindler’s List, which also had
sufficient space between the actual
event and the film’s release.
I really can’t fault this film. There’s
no aspect of it that let me down. The
music was amazing and slotted in
perfectly with each scene. There’s
one scene where you hear children
singing a bittersweet song about
their country against the backdrop
of all the chaos and destruction tak-
ing place. I can’t exactly describe
this movie as a beautiful one – I
don’t really get my kicks out of dead
bodies even though I’m a medic
– but some scenes were incredibly
atmospheric, both beautiful and
shocking at the same time. The pace
is fantastic too. It doesn’t linger; it
doesn’t really need to hammer home
the point of the film.
The real selling point of the film
is the acting. Each member of the
cast delivers a solid performance, in
particular Don Cheadle and Sophie
Okonedo who were both nominated
for Oscars. Cheadle’s representa-
tion of Paul is realistic. The man
struggles with his conscience until
he finds the courage, partly from his
wife, to stand up and fight to save
these people. He is not a two-dimen-
sional character. Initially naïve
enough to believe all the rhetoric
handed down to him by his employ-
ers and the western people he
encounters, he is later shocked by
a conversation he has with Colonel
Oliver (Nick Nolte). Paul realizes
that the West does not care how
many people die and that the only
way to save his family and the refu-
gees he’s been left with is to use his
superior intelligence to manipulate
the people around him.
This film is hard to watch. You
just want the relentless pain and
torture to stop but it never does,
which, I guess, makes it more real-
istic. It’s not that it’s drawn out; it’s
just so exhausting that the message
seems to have more resonance. The
politics is summed up perfectly and
the racism displayed by Western
leaders stays with you long after the
lights go up.
It’s simple. By focusing on Paul
and his family we see love and even
comedy but the film isn’t afraid
to show you the distasteful big
picture either. This truly is a film
that needs to be seen, but you do
need to be prepared to be slightly
frustrated. Hotel Rwanda could be
describing so many current situa-
tions occurring all over the globe
and sadly many past and future
events too. It shows you the deplor-
able side of human nature, but also
that little glimmer of hope that main-
tains your faith in humanity.
