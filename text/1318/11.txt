ICU CHOIR
SPRING CONCERT:
BRAHMS: A GERMAN
REQUIEM
8pm
Great Hall, Sherfield Building
Student/Other: £3/7
On the door: £4/8
After the death of his moth-
er in 1865, Brahms’ grief
spurred him to compose this
Requiem. However, instead
of using the traditional Latin
text, with its terror of the
Day of Judgement, he care-
fully selected words from the
German Bible that would con-
sole the living. Ein Deutches
Requiem has since become a
Requiem for the early twenty-
first Century.
Tickets available every
lunchtime next week from
Level 2 of the Sherfield
Building.

the bible for thinking people
You may have wondered what the bible says.
Is it relevant? Is it trustworthy?
The Bible makes profound and universal claims.
Claims about your life and your future. Its claims
have changed millions of lives and caused
controversy the world over. Aren't claims like these
worth thinking about seriously for yourself without
relying on fashionable opinions that may be here
today and gone tomorrow?
Impact is the weekly lunchtime meeting that
provides this opportunity in an informal and friendly
environment so that you can investigate freely. We
begin with a short talk addressing common issues
followed by a chance to interact with the speaker
with any questions. We'll lay on some refreshments
and there's a bookstall for further reading. Why not
come along this week?

8th How do we know Jesus wasn’t an
