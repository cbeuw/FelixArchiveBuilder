In the same month that
NASA decided to abandon the
Hubble Space telescope and
a report found that the failed
Beagle 2 mission was ill-
prepared and under-funded,
the European Space Agency
(ESA) has celebrated the dual
success of the safe arrival of
the Huygens probe on Titan
and the launch of the Ariane 5
super-rocket.
The latest version of the
Ariane 5 lifts payloads of up
to 10 tonnes to geostation-
ary orbit and has reinstated
Europe’s competitiveness
on the world satellite launch
services market. On 12
February, the rocket success-
fully sent a Spanish military
telecommunications satellite
and a dummy payload into
orbit, just over two years after
the first attempt had ended
in failure. Jean-Yves Le Gall,
president of the Arianespace
company which develops and
launches the Ariane rock-
ets, had said before take-off:
“Ariane 5 will be the work-
horse of our company and the
European space industry for
the next 10 years.”
In the wake of the Ariane
launch, scientists have been
partying hard at the ESA: last
weekend the agency and the
European Commission organ-
ised a conference in Brussels
involving over 40 nations and
20 international organisations
to discuss space exploration.
Entitled ‘Winning through
cooperation: sharing the ben-
efits of space’, the conference
was aimed to enable dialogue
between suppliers and indus-
tries that demand the space
technology.
Attending the conference,
ESA Director General Jean-
Jacques Dordain said: “The
successful launch of Ariane
5 brought us ‘back to the
future’, boosting Europe’s
guaranteed access to space.
And this outstanding achieve-
ment comes only a month
after the discovery of a new
world through the spectacu-
lar descent of ESA’s science
probe Huygens onto Titan.”
The ESA is an independent
agency, not part of the EU.
However, close ties are being
developed between the two
organisations.Jointinitiatives
such as the European global
navigation system Galileo,
which is set to rival the US’
Global Position System (GPS)
and towards which the EU
are paying 1m euros, are
indicative of the increasing
role of space exploration
in European economic and
political development. The
EU’s new constitution has
also significantly mentioned
‘space’ for the first time.
Vice President Günter
Verheugen,EUCommissioner
for Enterprise and Industry,
said at the conference in
Brussels: “The European
Union, the European Space
Agency and the Member
States should optimise their
relations and respective
resources. The Commission
is currently working on a pro-
posal for a genuine European
Space Policy. Reaching for
the stars brings very down
to earth benefits to our citi-
zens and industry, from radio
navigation, communication
by satellite or early warning
of natural disasters.”
Verheugen also said he
would propose a significant
increase in the Commission’s
research funding, which one
official said was 235m euros
($306.8m) over the period
2003-2006. This is still minis-
cule in comparison with the
$16.4 bn budget proposal set
by George W Bush for NASA.

As students we are all too
familiar with the feeling of
overwhelming boredom,
fatigue, and drowsiness that
puzzlingly accompanies most
university lectures, and the
intense contagious yawning
that follows.
Although common amongst
most of the animal kingdom
(most mammals and some
birds and reptiles yawn), lit-
tle is known about the rea-
sons for yawning and for the
generation of a contagious
response (55 per cent of peo-
ple will yawn within five min-
utes of seeing someone else
yawn). Research into this
area has been lacking.
It is widely accepted that
yawning results in an inter-
nal physical response, as the
sudden deep intake of oxy-
gen increases the heart rate
(heart rates can rise up to
30 per cent during a yawn),
helping release the lungs and
bloodstream of carbon diox-
ide and forcing more oxygen
into the brain. Yawning is
thought to effectively venti-
late the lungs, to heighten
our alertness and to restore
normal breathing.
But yawning has been (and
still is) surrounded by a hazy
cloud of mystery, with theo-
ries and speculation having
been put forward as to what
triggers it and why it takes
place. Still scientists still don’t
understand all the biological
mechanisms involved in this
process.
Fa r- f e t c h e d - s o u n d i n g
hypotheses have often been
put forward. Are we to believe
one such theory, claiming
yawning is merely a primitive
remnant of our ancestors’
intimidatory tactics, where a
yawn would bear our ever-so-
frightening teeth?
The intensely inconsistent
boredom theory (which is
ratherself-explanatory)might
be readily endorsed by those
of us who suffer from a rather
restricted attention span but
doesn’t explain, for example,
why we yawn before compet-
ing in an important sporting
event or before delivering a
crucial presentation.
Attempts to explain the
reasons for yawning as a
result of low oxygen or high
carbon dioxide levels (which
we would experience during
fatigue or sheer boredom,
where breathing is shallow
and little oxygen reaches the
lungs) have proved rather
unconvincing.
Conclusions from research
published in the journal
Ethology by Professor Robert
Provine of the University of
Marlyand in 1987, later con-
firmed in a 1997 paper in
the journal Psychonomic
Bulletin & Review by Dr
Ronald Baenninger of John
Hopkins University, showed
that people receiving addi-
tional oxygen didn’t decrease
yawning and people exposed
to a lower amount of carbon
dioxide didn’t stop yawning.
Recent work by Dr Martin
Schurmann published in
the journal NeuroImage,
however, has furthered our
understanding of the conta-
gious nature of the yawning
process. Scientists found that
the true nature of contagious
yawns was as an automati-
cally released behavioural
action, rather than a truly
imitated motor pattern, as
was hitherto widely believed.
Hence, contagious yawning
was proven not to be simply
an imitation act.
This data was obtained
by MRI (magnetic reso-
nance imaging) scanning of
the brains of 30 volunteers
exposed to videos of recorded
yawns, and suggests a com-
municative function of yawns
whereby these constitute
social clues that synchronise
group behaviour.
Dr Schurmann writes in his
paper: “Group synchronisa-
tion could be essential for
species survival and works
without action understanding,
like when a flock of birds rises
in the air as soon as the first
bird does so – supposably as
it notices a predator.”
The purpose of group syn-
chronised yawning, how-
ever, was not suggested and
remains unknown.
It’s peculiar how a reflex so
ordinary, a reflex so outward-
ly straightforward, harm-
less and natural, could be so
poorly understood, yet lack
of research in this area isn’t
so surprising, as other more
pressing matters must domi-
nate the forefront of most sci-
entists’ minds.
As yawning is trouble-free
for most of us, studies into the
phenomenon will continue to
be rare and our inability to
fully comprehend it will inevi-
tably remain lacking for some
time. Even reading about
yawning can make you yawn;
chances are you already have,
by now.

Europe sets its sights on space
The success of the Huygens probe and Ariane 5 rocket have boosted Europe’s reputation in space
exploration. Darius Nikbin reports on a conference promoting EU cooperation in space
“The successful
launch of Ariane
5 boosts Europe’s
guaranteed access
to space...”
Yawning: cats do it, humans do it... but why?
