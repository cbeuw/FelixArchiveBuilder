Music is a passion for many, and
so I thought a nice little method for
describing artists was required.
There is so much you can do with
music, and yet most popular art-
ists nowadays try to get away with
as little as possible. Surely music
has to be interesting? Surely some-
thing should happen in the three
or four minutes that you listen to a
song? Not if you are Damien Rice.
His name alone bores me, and sel-
dom has someone had to change
the radio whilst driving so quickly in
order to prevent them from falling
asleep and crashing. So he gets the
fabled ‘worst, most dull artist ever’
position in the continuum.
Ambient music has more presence
than Mr Rice, despite less actual
noise. Obviously he’s closely fol-
lowed by such luminaries as David
Gray, Katie Melua and their friends.
Gradually you work up through the
dross (Embrace, Doves etc) to the
average, interesting band, who can
write a pop ditty and keep you all
entertained. Plus there’s the old
cheese attraction. People like McFly
may be rubbish, but at least it’s
interesting rubbish.
Then you move on to people like
Lost Prophets, or Morrissey, where
your attention is grabbed and held.
Finally the masters come into town,
with artists like The Mars Volta,
Aphex Twin, Thelonius Monk and
Jeff Buckley, who hold your atten-
tion even when long ‘wig-outs’ are
in progress. This is purely because
they are a million times the art-
ist bloody Damien Rice is. A chart
explains it all below:
Rubbish Damien Rice
Dull Doves
OK McFly
Good Lost Prophets
I want your The Mars Volta
children
Now what is the point of all this?
The point is that it’s a system that
the music companies are adopt-
ing to prevent people buying the
wrong type of music. They don’t
want 85-year-old grannies suddenly
admitted to A&E due to excessive
excitement caused by interesting
music. That’s the source of lawsuits,
and seeing as they can barely afford
to keep their children in million-
dollar fur coats with all the piracy
nowadays, it’s a risk they can’t afford
to take.
But what does it take for a band
to be interesting? Is it the same
thing that makes them good live?
Is it the music? Or is it the man
standing behind you with a gun to
your head? A mix of all the above
surely, like the Scissor Sisters’ show
– flamboyant, entertaining, cracking
music and free gunman with every
CD.
But then again, the interesting
bands aren’t for everyone, for they
require concentration in order to
appreciate the music; as opposed to
Rice who requires effort to prevent
the sound going into your ears and
destroying your soul.
The musical continuum
by TRISTAN LANE
Being stuck a lab with polymerase
chain reactions and electrophore-
sis to keep me busy has meant my
romantic life has taken a turn for the
worse. Long days, ten hours long,
from nine in the morning to seven
in the evening, mean the work-
swamped Stormy is fighting very
hard to ensure that a lack of play
does not make her a dull girl! And a
lack of play – with only the intranet
and geeky married boffins with par-
ents’ evenings for conversational
sparkle – means new opportunities
have to be sought out in the bea-
con of intellectual talent (sic) that
comprises the Medical Research
Council.
With my previous experiences of
good-looking men being uninspiring,
due to their lack of personality (ie
not having one), I hope the boffins
may reveal some unearthed poten-
tial amongst their cerebral masses.
And it is with this optimism that I
begin ‘Hospital Watch’, in the vein of
‘Neighbourhood Watch’, for fit doc-
tors and researchers.
Besides Hospital Watch, I’ve not
been up to much. The talent I’ve
started to attract is very distinctive
– especially with regards to their
appearance. I’ve had a Jew and
Muslim, skullcap and beard intact,
enquire outright about my romantic
status. I’ve also been out to dinner
with a baptised Sikh, complete with
sword, turban and bangle, alongside
a dreadlocked anarchist (yes, I can’t
resist them in their natural form
– everybody has their fetish and
locked hair on white/Asian guys is
mine) from Gwent’s anarchist crew.
They were both very fascinating
conversationalists, let me assure
you – with sketchy pseudo-badboy
pasts and an idealistic take on life.
Alas, neither of them got further
than a friendly hug thanks to Stormy
developing feelings for another guy.
You’re shocked? I am too. I’ve
never had to deal with this before.
My libido is at an all time high, since
I keep turning down offers left right
and centre. I’m not interested in
meaningless (albeit very fun) sex,
or short term relationships with
very generous men (face it, how
long will a practising Muslim put
up with a girl who drinks, smokes
shisha and enjoys wearing skimpy
clothes, not to mention having a sex
life outside marriage?). I actually
like being around him, telling jokes,
swapping stories, sharing dreams.
I’m not afraid to be my irreverent
self around him.
So what’s the big deal? It’s the
disclosure aspect of intimacy that
fazes me. Actually letting him in on
my deeper feelings and quirks. What
if he can’t deal with the different
groups of friends I have to reflect
different parts of my personality?
What if he’s secretly resenting the
fact I come from a different back-
ground compared to what he’s used
to – wishing me to be like every-
one else. I have different snacks
in my kitchen made out of unusual
ingredients, that I’m used to eat-
ing my home-cooked food with my
hand – the way it’s done in my par-
ents’ land. It’s almost understand-
able how a girl could become self-
conscious in these ‘disclosure’ type
situations – and perhaps fall (out of
familiarity-based convenience) for
the gangster Sikh who eats food the
same way, and keeps a similar snack
collection in his cupboard.
The mind boggles. True love over-
comes these insecurities if both
partners are adventurous and will-
ing to accept the other with what-
ever baggage they may come with.
Or so I’d like to think; I wouldn’t
know for sure having never been in
a functional relationship, let alone
love, during my brief but eventful
stay on this Good Earth.
So there we go. A brief synopsis of
my week. It’ll be more eventful next
time. Promise.
