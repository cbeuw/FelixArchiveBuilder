Students have been asked
to take particular care over
security in halls of residence
this week following thefts
from Linstead Hall, Princes
Gardens.
According to eyewitness-
es at Linstead, an intruder
gained entry when a student
let him in after he knocked
on the door outside to attract
attention. He then proceeded
to take items from unlocked
rooms, but was caught doing
so and was then chased
out of the building. Despite
College Security being called,
the intruder managed to
escape whilst the security
guards were investigating
another area of the hall.
After being chased around
Princes Gardens and South
Kensington by residents,
the man finally got away by
jumping on a bus as it
stopped at nearby traffic
lights.
According to one eyewit-
ness, “The intruder came
running down the stairs
while security officers were
upstairs looking for him. He
then pushed his way past a
female student at the door
and escaped”. Fortunately,
no-one was seriously injured
in the incident, and all stolen
items were recovered as they
were dropped in the chase.
These included his hat and
coat, which contained more
stolen items, suggesting
to police that the man is a
regular criminal in the local
area.
It is not the first time that
Linstead hall – or halls of
residences in general – have
been targeted. Terry Branch,
the College’s Chief Security
Officer, told Felix: “We believe
he [the thief] did exactly the
same thing at Linstead Hall
earlier this term. We also
believe he is the same man
who was arrested for break-
ing into Beit Hall in 2002 and
imprisoned for two years”.
Details of the latest incident
were captured on CCTV, and
Security and police hope that
an arrest will follow.
Mr Branch explained that
students should never let
anyone they don’t know into
halls, and stressed the impor-
tance of reporting anything
out of the ordinary to College
Security immediately: “If you
see someone suspicious in
or around halls of residence,
don’t confront them, call
Security and we’ll respond
every time.” He added that
it was crucial to describe the
incident accurately, stating
whether or not you believe
there are still intruders in the
building. Security officers are
thought to have been una-
ware that the intruder was
still present on their arrival
at Linstead.
There have been reports
that Security guards went up
in the lift when they arrived at
Linstead, allowing the intrud-
er to run down the stairs and
escape. Mr Branch was una-
ble to comment on that, but
assured Felix that Security
were “putting in a higher
presence at residences”.
