Cutting carbon under Kyoto
The Kyoto Protocol for reducing greenhouse gas emissions came into force last week, write
Natasha Lippens and Joseph Bull. Can Imperial College help the UK meet its target?
As the history of the ice ages shows,
the Earth’s temperature has swung
widely in the past, long before
humans could have had any effect
upon the climate. Still, most nota-
ble scientific studies conclude that
greenhouse gases are accumulat-
ing in the Earth’s atmosphere as a
result of human activities.
The greenhouse gases include
methane and carbon dioxide, and
are thus termed due to their ability to
trap heat within the atmosphere, as
a greenhouse might. Anthropogenic
greenhouse gases, which have been
accumulating since the start of the
industrial revolution, are believed
by many to be causing large scale
global warming. It is known that
warming can cause sea levels to
rise, glaciers to shrink, accelerated
desertification and biodiversity loss.
However, the exact role of the gases
remains uncertain.
The complexity of climatic sys-
tems renders it difficult to predict
exactly what changes will take
place, and how quickly. An example
of an unexpected effect is that the
melting ice caps could halt the Gulf
Stream (an oceanic current bring-
ing warm water to the UK from the
tropics), freezing the UK.
Although it has certainly been
established that the climate is rap-
idly changing, the media and cer-
tain political administrations often
portray the more relevant debate
(as to whether the change is human
induced) as hotly contested. In real-
ity, this is not quite the case, and the
‘sceptics’ are a dwindling band.
In fact, a few days ago, evidence
was released, by US researchers
no less, that is considered by many
to “...destroy a central argument
of global warming sceptics... that
climate change could be a natural
phenomenon” (The Independent).
The general consensus now is that
something should be done to stop or
at least mitigate this. In 1997, follow-
ing less powerful legislation passed
in 1992, governments agreed to the
(legally binding) Kyoto Protocol.
The Kyoto Protocol came into
force last Wednesday, February 16,
seven years after it was agreed.
The accord requires the 141 signa-
tory countries, accounting for 55% of
greenhouse gas emissions (but not
including the US, which accounts
for over 20% alone), to cut emissions
of carbon dioxide and other green-
house gases by 5.2% by 2012.
Greenhouse gases targeted for
reduction under the Kyoto Protocol
include carbon dioxide, methane
and nitrous oxide. The emission
targets are not for each gas spe-
cifically, but rather for a combina-
tion of the gases weighted by their
relative greenhouse effect. Kyoto
critics claim that these targets are
too conservative: the consensus
among many climate scientists is
that, in order to avoid the worst
consequences of global warm-
ing, emissions cuts in the order of
60% across the board are needed.
As such, at best, Kyoto should be
viewed as a first step in the right
direction.
Each country that signed the pro-
tocol agreed to its own specific tar-
get, and Britain has said that it will
reduce its emissions by 5.2% of 1990
levels. The Kyoto Protocol has provi-
sions that allow its signatory nations
(and, by extension, their business-
es) to use global markets if they
undercut or overreach their targets,
through various mechanisms, such
as emissions trading.
This works by allowing countries
to buy and sell their agreed allow-
ances of greenhouse gas emissions:
highly polluting countries can buy
unused ‘credits’ from those that
are allowed to emit more than they
actually do. Countries are also able
to gain credits for activities that
boost the environment’s capacity to
absorb carbon, such as tree planting
and soil conservation. The advan-
tage of emissions trading (which is
emerging as a key environmental
tool) is that it ensures that emission
reductions take place where the
cost of reduction is lowest, thus low-
ering the global costs of combating
climate change. Equally, the lucra-
tive emissions market will provide
a strong incentive to behave in an
environmentally responsible way.
The UK has set carbon limits for its
companies, and a national emissions
trading scheme began in 2002, in a
microcosm of the international com-
munity. Our own Imperial College,
with 11,500 tonnes of carbon emit-
ted annually (last year’s figures),
overshoots its limit and is thus pres-
ently set to be disadvantaged by
the carbon market. Luckily, a world-
renowned centre for research into
technology should have the capac-
ity to reduce its emissions. Even if
the threat of exacerbated climatic
change cannot motivate it to do so,
then surely the prospect of being a
financial loser in the carbon market
will?
There are a number of ways
Imperial might go about cutting its
emissions, an obvious one being to
turn to a heavier dependence upon
renewable sources of energy if pos-
sible (other universities, like Oxford
and Sussex, have already achieved
this). With an annual energy bill as
large as ours (£7m) this could well
help turn the emissions tide for us.
But whatever route we take to fall
in line with Kyoto, or even capitalise
upon the market and help swell our
apparently depleted coffers, it is an
achievable goal.
Since the carbon market’s incep-
tion, 6000 companies in the UK
reduced carbon dioxide emissions
by 4.64 million tonnes in the first
year, and by 5.2 million tonnes in the
second!
Aside from the obvious benefits
to students and staff that not wast-
ing money can bring, Imperial
has the additional pressure that
its students, in general, want it to
reduce its environmental impact:
in an open survey of over 300 stu-
dents, greater than 95% agreed that
they felt this way. But in this case
we, as students, should also take
responsibility and reduce our envi-
ronmental impact, not just to help
our university and country adhere
to Kyoto, but to counter the possibil-
ity of our climate changing. And the
possibility is frightening: some of
the most reliable models available
predict that, almost within our life-
times, global average temperature
will change by between two and ten
degrees celsius.
FairTrade fortnight begins
Jamie Brothwell gives an overview of 14 days of FairTrade activity at Imperial
FairTrade Fortnight began on
Tuesday. This two-week period
gives the opportunity for people to
re-evaluate their attitudes as con-
sumers and hopefully realise the
responsibility that they have to the
producers of their food.
A FairTrade stall will be appearing
at various places around campus
over the next 14 days to inform
students about FairTrade and to
offer a wide range of free samples.
There will be all the products that
can already be found at conscien-
tious Union outlets at this time, as
well as many other different foods
and drinks which can be found fur-
ther afield. The stall itinerary is
displayed on the blue panel (below
left), and I encourage all to come
along and get more information, try
the coffees, taste the biscuits, smell
the peppermint teas, love the choco-
lates and support the cause!
The FairTrade logo is given to
products which give a fair price to the
third world farmer who grew them.
For this fortnight, the FairTrade
Foundation (www.fairtrade.org.uk)
has given five very important guar-
antees for all their products:
● The FairTrade mark guarantees
farmers’ organisations a fair and
stable price for their products.
● The FairTrade mark guarantees
extra income for farmers and plan-
tation workers to improve their
lives.
● The FairTrade mark guarantees
greater respect for the environ-
ment.
● The FairTrade mark guarantees
smaller farmers a strong position in
world markets.
● The FairTrade mark guarantees a
closer link between consumers and
producers.
FairTrade sales are doubling every
two years and the logo can now be
found on over 500 retail and 200
catering products. All major super-
markets now stock FairTrade goods,
although with varying degrees of
commitment.
As I hope you are all aware, our
students’ union does a good job of
offering a wide range of FairTrade
foods and drinks. Looking around
campus, we can spot the FairTrade
logo in many places:
● Tikki café in the JCR serves excel-
lent FairTrade coffee and chocolate.
● The Union newsagent on the
walkway stocks a wide FairTrade
selection of chocolates, flapjacks,
biscuits, mueslis and cereal bars.
● The BMS coffee shop has a
FairTrade coffee machine.
● DaVinci’s bar sells FairTrade cof-
fee and teas.
● The Chaplaincy (East Wing of
Beit Quad) offers a very good range
of FairTrade chocolates, cereal bars,
sugar, teas and coffees.
With the ‘poster-blindness’ that
most students now suffer from, it
is easy to miss the FairTrade logo
when grabbing a coffee and a flap-
jack over lunch. The aim of this
fortnight is to make you more aware
of the choice around you, so that you
can make sure that your food and
drink is fairly traded.
Please make the ethical choice
around college. It sends out a mes-
sage to the caterers and managers
that Imperial is ready to take respon-
sibility for purchases, and that the
inexorable journey to FairTrade
University status must be embraced
by College and Union alike.
Now is not a time for moral com-
placency. FairTrade status will
only be achieved when FairTrade
coffee and tea is offered in every
PhD café, in every catering out-
let and for every official meeting
and event throughout college; when
people must actively ask for a non-
FairTrade coffee at meetings and
when every vending machine stocks
some FairTrade chocolate. There is
still much to do.
The fortnight aims to raise aware-
ness of the ideals of FairTrade and
to promote the growing range of
fairly-traded products available. A
stall will be set up at various points
around campus which will offer
information and free samples.
