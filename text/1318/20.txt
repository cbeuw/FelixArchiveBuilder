There are prizes for the top teams
at the end of the year!
Issue 1316 Answers
In that week’s issue we had the
Heroes and Villains quiz, and you
all seemed pretty happy with us
describing Usher as shit. There was
a bit of disagreement over us call-
ing Bono a hero though. Apparently
he’s not quite as great as he seems
to think he is. When you compare
him to The Hoff, who singlehandedly
brought down the Berlin Wall, you
realise just how little the idiot has
actually done.
That said, Achtung Baby is pretty
good.
1. Bono’s real name is Paul
Hewson.
2. KITT stands for Knight
Industries Two Thousand.
3. Mr T played Clubber Lang
in Rocky III, and not Rocky like
we said. Only Forever Throwing
Doubles noticed our ‘delibrate’ mis-
take, and so they get some bonus
points, just like they asked!
4. Homer was called Mr Plow.
5. Action Man was born in 1966. He
should really jack it in to be honest.
6. Ellen’s boat was called B+Q
something or other.
7. Kate Moss was 14 when she
was first discovered, and from that
day on she’s made a very lucrative
career from being thin. Nice work
Kate.
8. Usher has his own credit card
thing. You see, he’s totally, com-
pletely, one hundred percent, in it
for the music.
9. Dr Evil’s cat is called Mr
Bigglesworth.
“And When Mr Bigglesworth gets
angry, people die!”
10. Robbie Savage has only got one
red card.
11. Barney’s evil mantra goes...
“I love you, you love me, We’re a
happy family, with a great big hug
and a kiss from me to you, won’t you
say you love me too?”
12. Michael Jackson’s most suc-
cessful album was Thriller.

FUCWIT update
History of Hoff
If you’ve ever seen any of my TV shows, you’ll know the kind of life I lead. Every day is a new adventure, a new chance to get laid. But those things
you see on TV are nothing compared to what I really get up to. I’ve been present at all of the major events of the 20th century, lending moral support
through song. It’s my gift, and I share it with the world. Here’s some pictures of me, and in the background some important stuff is going on. There’s
two points if you tell me what’s going on, and another two if you can suggest a suitably funny song for me to sing. There’s some ideas below
8. I remember this one well. Those
boys, they changed the world!
‘Come Fly With Me’
1. Nice guy! Too bad we swapped
seats a while earlier. I guess I’m just
bulletproof.
‘(Shot through the Heart) You
Give Love A Bad Name’
2. Man, this place was hot! For a
proud American like me, this was
the place to be back in the sixties.
‘Jungle Boogie’
3. My gift to the world. I bought this
down, all by myself. I rock!
‘Another Brick in the World’
4. It was damn cold, and getting here
was an absolute nightmare. But it’s
nice to know I was first.
‘River Deep, Mountain High’
5. It was definitely a mistake com-
ing here, I’ve never walked properly
since.
‘She Bangs’
6. It’s a testament to my skills that
I can sing without the need for oxy-
gen. That’s how talented I am.
‘Man on the Moon’
7. This was a real fun day. No idea
what any of it meant though, I’m a
Polo guy myself.
‘Gold’
9. I think we all make mistakes, but
this was a pretty big one for me.
‘Seven Nation Army’
10. Thanks to this, a whole gen-
eration has become brain dead
morons.
‘Black and White Town’
