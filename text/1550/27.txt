hands
Denis Hyka is from Albania and currently works for Imperial College in catering.
I started to draw and paint when I was in kindergarten. Since then it has always remained as a hobby, with a desire to do and create more, and
I’m always trying to stay true to my style hoping to reach a wider audience.
I like to draw hands and bring them into focus as they play an important part on the way we express our feelings in different situations. In this draw-
ing I wanted to capture some fleeting moments of different people while focusing on their hands. With their strength, elegance, shapes hands say a
lot about someone’s personality.”

TRUTH
by Cosmin Badea
Truth
Can be most painful
Right when it brings the end
Of the belief in evil.
Right when it brings the death
Of cruelty.
Because it suddenly uncovers
The cruelty
That you allowed to be born
Believing in evil
And to trickle down
As burning tar to hurt
All the open heart
Which won’t close, depart,
‘Till it brings about
Truth.
DAWN
I know that life is but a dream
That never comes again
And some just want to set their hearts
Aflame,
But all I wanted was to keep
To keep us two alive.
Before it ends and we wake up,
Before the dawn,
I look around, I seek inside,
But find I die alone.
