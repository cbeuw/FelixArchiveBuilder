Review: Shampoo Boy
Ross Gray explores Peter Rehberg’s dark new collaboration
B
lackest Ever Black, the
aptly named London la-
bel that has been grab-
bing attention with
crushingly dark elec-
tronic releases for the past few years,
seems like an ideal home for Peter Re-
hberg (PITA, Editions Mego head),
Christina Nemec, and Christian
Schachinger’s new project Shampoo
Boy.
One for fans of drone of all kinds
and dark ambient, Shampoo Boy’s
improvised debut Licht can be seen
to further Rehberg’s work in KTL,
where dark atmospherics were domi-
nant but the instruments and sounds
were largely kept tightly contained.
Licht consistently feels as if it is push-
ing the limits of the equipment it is be-
ing played through, like control could
be lost at any second and the work
descend into unrestrained scream-
ing noise reminiscent of Merzbow.
here’s a sense that the distortion of
these ominous, unrelenting drones
could escape and envelop the sound-
scape completely at any moment.
Licht manages to balance the quiet
and the extreme to great eﬀect con-
stantly throughout. I often hear dis-
cussions of how noise music and
ambient music are two extremes of
the same scale, and are just diﬀerent
manifestations of the same musical
aim. his can be heard throughout
this album; there are moments of full-
blown PITA style glitch – never rhyth-
mic, always droning – over prolonged,
distorted guitar tones followed by am-
bient, somewhat soothing passages.
his contrast is most prominent in
the moments where there are some
sounds pushing the machinery to its
limit (as mentioned above) whilst, si-
multaneously, others could have been
pulled from music written by Steve
Roach on a bad acid trip.
hese sections ﬂow into each other
continually and smoothly, somewhat
aided by always holding one instru-
ment at a lower level; no matter how
much the guitar or electronics are
screaming, there is almost always
some softer, ambient slow textures
happening underneath the top-level
intensity. his makes the noise more
accessible, having a soft melody un-
derneath the abrasion that can eas-
ily be grabbed onto. It reminds me of
Prurient’s use of piano and strings
underneath crushing noise, adding an
element of euphoria to the piece.
It is diﬃcult to get through a de-
scription of this album without draw-
ing comparison to Rehberg’s work
with Stephen O’Malley as KTL, es-
pecially as upon holding the physical
release you immediately see that the
minimalistic artwork is credited to
O’Malley. Licht opens with menacing
guitar and bass drones and these con-
tinue fairly steadily throughout, vary-
ing from nearly Sunn O)))-level deep
resonation to barely detectable whis-
pers in the ambient sections.
It strikes me as somewhat odd that
some of the elements that seem to have
carried over from KTL would, you’d
think, have been due to O’Malley’s
work. hat said, a hefty amount of the
soft electronic fuzz borrows heavily
from Rehberg’s earlier work and the
proliﬁc output of Editions Mego.
Despite the inherent euphoria held
in some parts of the album (especially
the parts most informed by Mego), it
is fairly dark and omi-
nous through the dura-
tion; the quieter mo-
ments where one might
begin to take on an op-
timistic mood are crept
upon by foreboding, un-
easy sounds, as is imple-
mented particularly well
in ‘Still’. Reviewing this
on a sunny summer day
instead of huddled over
in a depressed hump in
the dead of winter feels
like somewhat of an in-
sult to the work, but it
does make for prime late
night staying at home
music.
here’s a remarkably diverse range
of timbres to be found within Licht
and I may have undersold this by just
focusing on the parts that grabbed me
most; whilst the work remains the-
matically related throughout, this is
not achieved via consistently using the
same sounds, but rather through the
full incorporation of this threatening
undertone at all times. hat is perhaps
the most important way this stunning
debut manages to keep an air of un-
ease and discomfort at all times; the
constant threat of something worse.
his album is yet another triumph for
the already incredibly strong set of
Blackest Ever Black releases this year,
further emphasising their reputation
for being able to ﬁnd some of the most
chilling music out there.
BESURENOTTOMISS
Scanner opens a collection of sound
installations inspired by John Dow-
land’s ‘Lachrimae’. He will be joined
by purveyor of orchestral doom and
multi-instrumentalist Bobby Krlic
(The Haxan Cloak), who will be
presenting a new piece of music also
drawing heavily from ‘Lachrimae’, as
well as some works from his 2013 al-
bum Excavation.
I’ll be jumping on the chance to
see an original work performed live
by The Haxan Cloak; especially at
£5 for students. The night also fea-
tures inventive audiovisual installa-
tion from The Computer Junk Or-
Ambarchi provides a solo live per-
formance with a twist at Cafe Oto.
He presents ‘Knots’ the epic center-
piece of last year’s Audience Of One
along with frequent collaborator Joe
Talia on drums and a large ensem-
ble that includes James Rushford on
cello among many other performers.
he 30-minute-plus piece builds and
decays through various themes and
its interpretation by a large ensemble
promises to provide some interest-
ing moments. If all that isn’t enough,
there’s also the premiere live perfor-
mance from Mark Harwood’s Astor
project.
Fabric and Red Bull Music Acad-
emy team up to bring the Infamous
masked New York rapper DOOM
back to the UK, in a live showcasing of
the JJ Doom project with Jneiro Jarel
on hursday following the release of
their critically acclaimed debut album,
Key To The Kuﬀs last year.
Heavy support provided by every-
one’s favourite Californian exile and
prominent Dublab member Kutmah,
alongside wonky hip-hop UK native
Bambooman, who has been part of
a recent movement to move found
sound and ﬁeld recording into more
dance-ﬂoor friendly material.
Released on Mike Patton’s Ipecac
label, Palms sees 3 members of Isis
join Chino Moreno of Deftones fame,
making an album whose sound is
somewhere between the two. Where
Aaron Turner’s inscrutable vocals on
esoteric, often philosophical topics
(Panopticon) or abstract concept al-
bums (Oceanic) gave Isis an ethereal
quality, Palms has the more clear-cut
and emotive singing of Chino Moreno.
It appears that the delivery of the
Isis members has taken a bit of a page
from Deftones and in doing so creates
something unique in the back cata-
logues of either group.
To put it more plainly, the album
has roots in the past materials of both
Isis and Deftones, but brings both into
new ground. It could then be that this
album has appeal to both fans of Isis
and Deftones, as well as people who
are unfamiliar with either.
Speciﬁc highs include the album
ender ‘Antarctic Handshake,’ which
is an epic musical journey lasting al-
most ten minutes. Perhaps this choice
shows my assessment of the album, as
this work would comfortably sit some-
where in the Isis discography. Like
many of their fans, I just really like Isis,
and tracks like ‘Antartic Handshake’ or
‘Shortwave Radio’ deliver the interplay
of drums, bass and guitar that charac-
terized Isis. Sometimes dismissed as
hipster metal, Isis’ albums always re-
ceived a large portion of critical rec-
ognition, especially alongside many
diverse projects within post-metal.
his project, however, represents a
movement into rock territory.
Particularly moments in tracks like
‘Tropics’ seem to be informed by a pop
sensibility of sorts. As with any die
hard fan of either band, extensive lis-
tening is required to appreciate Palms
in spite of the greatness of old work.
Palms takes the form of an emotive
album where Moreno’s vocals are the
key centerpiece, compared to being
treated as simply another instrument
as in Isis. It does seem, however, that
Palms is a great album in its own right.
Palms’ self titled debut comes out 26th
June on Ipecac Records
