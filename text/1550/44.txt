Nothing makes you feel bet-
ter than a bit of minge. But
this week, you’ll be getting
none. None at all. You will, on
the other hand, be getting a
deduction of 40% from your
dissertation for giving it in
0.000002 seconds late. You
try to charm your way out of it
with your eyes and smile. You
get deducted 10% more.
This week Jupiter is aligning
with your face. This means it will
be hideous and you shouldn’t
leave the house for, hmmm,
say 400-500 days. Sorry. Oh
well, at least there’s TV and
stuff to watch on your laptop.
Your wifi is broken, and nobody
can come close enough to fix it
as you’re infectious. Sigh. Mas-
turbation it is then.
This week you have consti-
pation. You got it bad. It re-
ally hurts. When you finally
do get rid of a log monster
you decide to wrap it into a
condom and pop it back in.
Five hours in A&E later, and
you’re definitely going to be
in a medical textbook. Unfor-
tunately it’s on the front cover.
You’re famous.
This week you decide to grow
a revision beard to show every-
one how amazing and rugged
you are. It goes surprisingly
well. You get a lot of attention
and looks while in the library.
Should probably mention that
you’re a girl by the way. Okay,
if you’re reading this then you
could not be, but the stars are
not always right. Pint?
This week Saturn’s view of
the Moon is eclipsed by Jupi-
ter. This of course means that
goblins are free to roam about.
They congregate at Imperial,
where they will best blend into
the crowd. Nobody notices
anything out of the ordinary as
everyone’s too stressed. They
all get 90% on exams and
make the scaling unfavourable.
This week you find out that
“birthday suit” is not actu-
ally a form of fancy dress.
12 hours later and you are
released from the police sta-
tion with nothing more than
a caution, and an embar-
rassingly small sock to cover
your blushes. The sock gets
blown away by the wind and
you’re re-arrested.
This week you take your Red
Bull and Relentless addiction
up a notch. You synthesise
all of the active ingredients in
their purist form and then in-
ject them straight into you. It
doesn’t save you from failing
your exams, but you do get
commended on your initia-
tive. That will almost definite-
ly help when you get a third.
This week you are a bee.
Floating about and trying to
find someone to sting you get
lonely. You want some loving,
but find it odd to do the buzz-
ing nasty with the queen bee.
Mainly because she is your
mum, but also because liter-
ally thousands of your broth-
ers have been there too. You
die alone. Not buzzin.
This week you fall madly in love
with a handsome lecturer. The
way they integrate makes you
hot. When they solve differen-
tial equations you go weak at
the knees. There’s one simple
equation he can’t solve: him
and you, getting in on, on his
desk. Whenever he tries it he
gets 7.23, which is also on the
mark scheme.
Two chemists walk into a bar.
The first says “Hello, I’ll have
some H2
O please”. The sec-
ond says, “Oh, that sounds
good, I’ll have some H2
O as
well.” Realising that his plan
to kill the second chemist has
failed, the first chemist pulls
out a gun and shoots him
screaming “H2
O2
. YOU HAD
TO MAKE IT HARD”.
This week you have a 90s
and 2000s revival night.
Shaggy and Peter Andre are
blazing through the walls of
your room. You listen to the
lyrics. Realising that all the
songs you listened to as a
child were extremely dirty,
you finally have the answer
to the question: “Why are you
such a disgusting pervert?”.
This week you need to de-
cide between having to poo
out your eyes or wee out
of your ear. You could dis-
guise the urine as smelly
discharge, which is margin-
ally better. However, the poo
would mean you feel like that
prick from X Men. Just a liter-
ally shitter version. So, what’s
it going to be?
