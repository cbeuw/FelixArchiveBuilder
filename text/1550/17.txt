BEFORE THE DAWN
I slept alone last night
I dreamt of your last smile.
I hoped I’d see it shine
Again.
I slept alone all winter
I dreamt of what we were.
I woke to find the world
Aflame.
I slept alone all year
I dreamt of how we lost.
I hoped I’d not wake up
Alive.
I slept alone for sixty years
I dreamt of all the life we’d
have
I have been falling all my life
Alone.
I have been sleeping since
you left
I feel I’ll soon wake up.
I hoped I’d see your face
again
Before the dawn.
