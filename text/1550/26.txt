The main inspiration for my poetry is
and always has been an innate yearn-
ing for freedom, whether it be lodged
in world mythology, in the silence of the
forest or in the energy of a rock band,
as well as the endless possibilities of
language, which, if correctly wielded,
may open the floodgates to the blurring
of all known boundaries between reality
and the imperceptible.”
A WALK IN HYDE PARK
How calm the gladsome branches
in the solemn breeze that stirs
the untenanted silence of the footpaths
that slink away from the engines’ clamour
to a wild patch of grass
in deep oaken shades!
H to He,
and my shadow absorbs
whichever frequency dare fall
into its cavernous black-hole.
That same shadow trails my steps,
slung as a seditious aura
of sedation
of figurative mechanical motions
of circuitous circulating inhibitions
as if some mercurial potion
sought to release its portents
to the unsuspecting air,
to the astonished ghosts
that in the foggy hours
cluster like frayed electrons
around the magnetic pull
of a life-brimming meadow
whose edges, held to place
by unseen dwarfs heavily
heaving the burden of the sky,
are electrified with the strange reactions of cells breathing in unison,
of pores singing dioxidic songs,
of radiation scorching untrodden carpets,
and high aloft on full and plump clouds
a fortress proud and tall,
towers and wide gates
that inebriate with mesmeric legends
of obscure rivalrous destinies
are set up in quantum leaps by the giant hands
of some atemporal subspectral
power of imagining.
And with the ambitions of crumbling empires
dying in the distance,
I keep measuring my shadows
stemming from an oaken frame
as I still plod the silent footpaths
in a giddy mood
the heaven’s wines invoked
with persistent libations
from the subconscious crevices
the ground and each consecutive heatwave
unseal in their maddening
and violent full bloom
as they summon the fluttering of unwinged
scents of revolving roulettes of seasons,
painting quaint vignettes
of the fleeting dream
that was Spring.
