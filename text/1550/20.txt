This piece was made for the 2013 LeoSoc Exhibition, the title of which was
“Retrograde Progression”. When I heard this phrase, I wanted to experiment with
the connection between the past and the future in our lives, as I believe that our
present is formed by the continuous interaction of these two. The eye on the left is
the eye of my sister, symbolizing the future, while the one on the right belongs to my
grandmother, symbolizing the past.”
