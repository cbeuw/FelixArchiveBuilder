FRIDAY 07 JUNE

Pietro Aronica
he demonstrator, work-
ing late at night, still
has a stack of papers to
correct for the follow-
ing day. hough the bed
beckons to him, he relentlessly keeps
going, as students require his slightly-
above-minimum wage insights and
comments: without his feedback,
they would have literally no other way
to improve their marks. Or so he tells
himself, correcting for the umpteenth
time that night that the plural of “mo-
mentum” is not “momentums”.
He picks up his reference text to
check if a value is the right one: not
the oﬃcial answer outline, dated
and imprecise, but the report of a
particularly brilliant student. It has
equations and sources that the dem-
onstrator does not even know of, and
someone writing such things clearly
knows what they’re doing. He had
felt compelled to give it the maxi-
mum marks, sincerely hoping that he
hadn’t rewarded plagiarism.
In comparing the two reports, he
goes down the mandatory checklist.
Background theory? Convoluted, but
check. Figure explaining that one ef-
fect? Check. Equation for said eﬀect?
Check. Description of the experi-
ment? Incomplete, but check. Discus-
sion of the experiment? It’s wrong,
but, hey, at least it’s there. he result
is one of those reports clearly slapped
together two hours before the dead-
line, competent enough to show that
the work was (somewhat) done and
understood, and transparent in its I-
just-did-this-because-I-had-to spirit.
his kind of report can get more or
less any mark, depending on how anal
you want to be about the precise us-
age of commas and subscripts, far be-
yond the demonstrator’s willingness
to judge. He picks up a book, ﬂicks
to a random page and reads the ﬁrst
number he sees: it is odd. B it is then
for this report. He pens a 64 at the
bottom, and another one is done.
he next report appears to be mar-
ginally more competently written.
here are deﬁnitely a lot fewer typos,
and there is at least a rudimentary no-
tion of how a table should be made.
But before he can correct it, the dem-
onstrator has to perform a fundamen-
tal step: he searches her name on Fa-
cebook. He remembers her from the
lab, she was the one that had asked
him that question he couldn’t answer.
Well, this’ll teach you to shame me in
front of everyone! He scours the re-
port, ﬁnds a number with only three
signiﬁcant ﬁgures, and writes “insuf-
ﬁcient precision” in the comments
section. He gives it 55, a minute later
amended to 60 because he feels guilty,
and he goes on to the next one.
his reports starts awfully, with a
terrible, rambling introduction, and
for a moment the demonstrator gets
excited. His enthusiasm rises through
blurry images and poorly formatted
paragraphs, but unfortunately the
discussion of the experiment is im-
peccable, and he cannot give it any
less than a B. Just once, the demon-
strator wishes there were a truly dis-
astrous report so that he could take
out his red pen and write a big F on
it. “See me”, he could even write. But
there was no report that ever really
deserved that, and even those with
obvious ﬂaws had some redeeming
feature. Reluctantly, he gives it a 69,
giggles to himself, and then puts it
away.
He takes another one, and it is a
good one: correct use of references,
proper discussion and interpretation
and all the rest. Unfortunately for the
student, the demonstrator has run
out of As to give today. He wouldn’t
want to seem too generous, especially
when the other demonstrators are
boasting about failing people left and
right, and he has instituted a quota.
He feels sorry for the kid, especially
as he’s recognised him as one of the
quiet ones, but going back to change
the other marks would be entirely too
much eﬀort. He gives it a 68 before
taking another report.
he pile is still large, and the hour
is only getting later. It is hard to be a
demonstrator.
his is (mostly) a work of ﬁction. No
grade averages were harmed in the
making of this.
Pietro Aronica gives a – mostly fictional – parody of the precise
and hallowed science of marking lab reports
