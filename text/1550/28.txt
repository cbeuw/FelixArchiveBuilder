FAITH
’m bored! This just isn’t
fair, humans suck!”
“Now, now my dear,
calm down, there’s
no need to be upset.
You know your father
has been formulating
a plan for some time
now, we’ll get over this
slump.” Hera smiled at
her son across the table; it was a very
comprehending smile.
“It’s just, I don’t know what to do with
myself, mother. Before, when I wanted
entertainment I just started wars or
killed things. The Spartans loved me for
it! Do you remember that time I came
down and slew the Ekhidnades — it was

in games has always been predominantly on the creative

mythology and a desire to humanise the Gods, with a view
to expressing their struggle in gathering followers in our
modern society.

awesome, there was blood and gore eve-
rywhere!”
“Be patient son. You know the saying
‘patience is a virtue’; well your father
invented it. It was through it that we
earned our place here to begin with —
without it Olympus would still be ruled
by that oaf Kronus, I mean could you
imagine that?”
“True, from all I’ve heard grandfather
must have been a real bore.” Ares lifted
his chalice off the table and took a swig
of the violet liquid. Glancing down at
the ground he spotted his spear lying
there lifelessly, the once golden weapon
had now turned a dull shade of copper.
“But still, what’s it all worth now?
Look at this place, it’s in ruins! I’d rath-
er be in Eden — even after Eve ate that
damn apple!”
Ares was right. Olympus was a mess.
The once crystal blue waters that had
run through the Acropolis were now a
misty grey and the fountains that had
once showered the lush fields were
barely able to form a dribble. Hera re-
membered how the grass had once been
so vibrant and green that even Yaweh
had commented on it. “The grass is
always greener on the other side,” she
had sneered. Of course, Hera knew very
well that it wasn’t, nobody’s grass was
as green as theirs. But those days had
long passed, now the grass was patchy
and in some places wilted. Mother Na-
ture had far better gardens to tend to.
Ares looked up at the dilapidated col-
umns and sighed. “They used to reach so
high you couldn’t even see where they
ended. I remember racing Hermes to the
top — of course he cheated and used his
sandals.”
“Ha! I remember that day. You kids
were always up to mischief.”
“What’s he up to now, mother? I
haven’t seen my dear brother in centu-
ries.”
“Well you know what Maia and those
Pleiades whores are like, his mother
never gave him the guidance he de-
served. I heard he travelled East, got
himself involved with Vishnu’s lot.
They have so many deities over there
that he was able to slip in without any-
one really noticing. I’ve even heard he’s
having an affair with one of the Devas.
I’m happy for him.”
Hera paused for a second, and pon-
dered about what it would be like to
move away herself, start afresh, meet
someone new and fall in love all over
again. The thought excited her, but then
came that same old realisation, here she
was Queen — if she left she would be
a nobody.
“Now that Hermes has gone, poor Ha-
des has nobody to guide all the souls to
the Underworld,” she continued, trying
to distract herself. “Although it seems
that few want to go there nowadays,
most are heading to that dreaded place
Satan calls his home. Have you been?
It’s vile! The flames aren’t properly
looked after and they don’t even allow
pets in, poor Cerberus had to wait out-
side when we visited.”
“Hades was so upset when we left,”
she sighed “Not because he couldn’t af-
ford all the glamour, flashing lights and
bohemian lifestyle that Hell offered —
he was never into that kind of décor, he
preferred the more traditional haunted
look he gave the Underworld. No, it
was the sheer volume of people that
saddened him. Back in the Golden Age,
Hades always had first pick of the most
interesting people, he was so down with
pop culture.
“Even when Cerberus did that trick
where he licks him with all three
tongues at once it still didn’t cheer him
up. I think… I think I may have even
seen him shed a tear for the first time.”A
high pitch squeal escaped her lips as she
struggled to contain herself.
Ares stood up and rushed over to his
mother, his bronze armour squeaking
like a rusty bicycle chain. He wrapped
his arms around her, squeezing them
tightly.
“Don’t cry mother, I’m still here for
you.”
These past couple of millennia had
been hard, so many had deserted their
ranks. But they couldn’t leave. They
ruled Olympus. If they left what would
there be?
“We are strong,” Zeus had reminded
them. “We have beaten our forefathers
and we will rise again” — he just needed
to think up a plan. Centuries had passed
and he had yet to formulate one.
“Oh, we were so happy back then,”
sobbed Hera. She remembered sitting
by Zeus’ side. He was the man of her
dreams, so strong and wonderful, her
lover and her own brother! All those
soppy humans had worshipped them un-
conditionally.
How things had changed. Zeus’ once
resplendent white beard was now strag-
gly and grey. Hera wasn’t one to talk
either, her once soft skin had grown so
hard and cracked that she had gone as
far as removing all the mirrors from
her room. Yet, the thought of Athena’s
words provided her with solace:
‘To earn their faith we must first have
faith in ourselves.’
“Hey look on the bright side, at least
we’re not in Valhalla!” Ares exulted.
Hera chuckled and a smile formed on
her face again.
“I hear Valhalla is so empty nowadays
you could mistake Odin for one of the
statues! You know, apparently they’re
so short on Valkyries, that they’ve even
begun accepting cross-dressers!”
Their laughter filled the air — laugh-
ter was always the best medicine.
“I love you son,” she said smiling. “At
least we still have each other.”
“Love you too mother — yeah, at least
we’ll always have that!”
