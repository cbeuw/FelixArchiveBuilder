which includes King’s College Lon-
don, UCL and Manchester but not
Imperial – ﬁrst made their intentions
public in an article in Times Higher
Education in June 2011. he main
reason given for wanting the change
is to help allow the British system to
be more easily understood by foreign
employers. he current practice of
awarding students ﬁrsts, 2:1s , 2:2s
and thirds was only fully implemented
after World War I and is not widely
used outside of the UK.
he universities also argue that the
new grade system would be fairer and
provide potential employers more
information than the broad catego-
ries presently used. For example, un-
der the current system two students
might earn ﬁnal percentages of 59.0%
and 60.1% and yet be awarded the very
diﬀerent classiﬁcations of 2:2 and 2:1
respectively. A grade point average
would also encourage students in the
ﬁnal year to work hard regardless of
whether their marks so far are within
what would have previously been a
boundary for a particular classiﬁca-
tion.
Potential concerns, however, have
also been identiﬁed. he GPA might
lead to a greater focus on grades as op-
posed to learning the subject – possi-
bly leading to grade inflation and stu-
dents choosing easier modules to get
higher grades. his is the main reason
why the London School of Economics
opposes the changes. he lack of in-
formation given by the current broad
categories is also already alleviated by
employers being able to ask gradu-
ates for their academic transcripts or
a breakdown of their module marks.
It might therefore not be worth the
administrative cost of introducing a
completely new system.
he group of universities support-
ing the changes said, in a statement
released in September 2012, that they
were merely “seeking a measure that
can be a motivational tool for students
during their university study and give
employers and others the information
they need following graduation”. hey
added that they believed that “there
are aspects to academic practice in
the UK, including marking culture,
second marking, marking criteria,
and external examination, which can
indeed help to counteract some of the
concerns about the US experience of
GPA”.
While employers groups, such as
the Association of Graduate Recruit-
ers, have expressed cautious support
of the changes reactions from Impe-
rial students and academics have been
more ambivalent. Jonathan London,
Physics Departmental Representa-
tive, told Felix that he believed that
“we have a system which works, so
we should focus our time and money
on pressing issues”. An Imperial Col-
lege academic, who wishes to remain
anonymous, said: “his seems to be
change for change’s sake with little
beneﬁt to anyone. It will give a false
impression of precision beyond the
4 classes of degree we have now, and
that doesn’t help graduates or em-
ployers. And after all is done many
employers will still reasonable un-
derstand that a 2:1 from Imperial is
at least as good as a ﬁrst in the same
subject from non-name-city new-
university.” Another student, who did
not wish to be named, seemed to think
it was not really much diﬀerent: “It’s
just a diﬀerent way of showing your
performance, it won’t make you a bet-
ter or worse student. Besides, we can
look at our overall weighted percent-
age through the registry, which is way
more divided than with a GPA.”
he issue was discussed at the last
meeting of the Union Council and
will be considered further at the next
meeting. Deputy President (Educa-
tion) Doug Hunt said that he “will be
writing another paper for council next
week, which will have resolves and be-
liefs in it, as [he doesn’t] want to influ-
ence Council’s decision in anyway and
want it to be students’ voice not [his].”
he next Council meeting will be at
18:30 on June 11 in the Union Dining
Hall. All students are welcome to at-
tend and voice their opinion.

Mike Follett, a MBA student at the
Business School has been awarded
the ﬁrst place award for an advertis-
ing competition, ADMAP prize 2013
for his essay. he essay was entitled
“hinking in 3D”. Mike will receive the
Gold award and a cheque for $5,000
at the ADMAP Prize celebration event
on June 19th at the Cannes Lions In-
ternational Festival.
ADMAP is a magazine that is re-
leased monthly, it is written by expert
practitioners on advertising and com-
munications innovations. Contestants
for the ADMAP prize were required
to write an essay answering “Can
brands maximise proﬁts
and be a force for so-
cial good?”
he essay will be
published in the AD-
MAP June issue. he
essay concluded with:
“Business could be
more proﬁtable
and a force
for social
g o o d
if they
combined their objectives together
rather than focus on just making prof-
it.”
Follett, who worked in advertising
for ten years before coming to do an
MBA at Imperial, said: “If I had just
carried on working as I was before, I
would’ve given a very diﬀerent answer
than I gave after business bchool.” He
went on to say: “Business school sort
of ﬁlls in the gap of whatever expertise
you have built up in your career.
It also gives you a chance to
take a look at what you
already know and how
you view the world.”
