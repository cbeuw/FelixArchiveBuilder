mperial is a science-focused
university, but look beneath
the surface and the depth of
artistic, musical and literary
talent to be found among
our staff and students is
truly astonishing. We have
a contemporary art gal-
lery, the Blyth Gallery in
the Sherfield building, that
regularly features work by
Imperial students alongside
other emerging London artists. Our
symphony orchestra is considered one
of the finest university orchestras in the
UK, and exists alongside an array of
other musical groups and societies as
well as an award-winning dance com-
pany. Several academic departments
have artists-in-residence working

alongside researchers. The Humani-
ties Department (yes, we do have one,
well-hidden though it is in the depths of
Sherfield) runs a creative writing course
led by an Orange-prize longlisted nov-
elist. Imperial defies the ‘two-cultures’
divide. That a world-class institution in
scientific research and education can si-
multaneously have such a thriving crea-
tive culture proves that art and science
are not incompatible opposites. Instead
they can co-exist — in the same person,
the same place, the same endeavour —
and perfectly complement each other.
This edition of Phoenix then is all about
those intersections: the way an individ-
ual balances their creative and scientific
accomplishments within their own life,
how different cultures and influences
come together to inspire original art, the
use of art in communicating and visual-
ising science, how scientific fact meets
literary flair in speculative fiction, and
even the merging of creative expression
with physical strength and discipline in
dance. In the following pages, features
focusing on these intersections are in-
terwoven with submissions from across
the Imperial community (from under-
graduates to support staff to academ-
ics), including poetry, short stories and
visual art. I hope this goes some way
towards demonstrating the diversity
and the quality of the artistic accom-
plishments achieved here, and gives a
glimpse into the complex reality that
exists behind Imperial’s official scien-
tific face.

Epigenetics is something beyond or above genetic control. For example, identical
twins may look significantly different when they have grown up in different conditions.
Likewise, a bee and a bee pupae also have the same genetic code but look totally dif-
ferent during their life time. These differences may stem from epigenetic control. Here
the hands represent control or manipulation, and small molecules are natural products
which can modulate the epigenetic process.”
Ben Miles and Ken Srimongkolpithak
are PhD students in Imperial’s Institute
of Chemical Biology. They use their ar-
tistic talents to create visualisations of
their nanoscale research, and both have
had their work featured on the covers of
scientific journals.
