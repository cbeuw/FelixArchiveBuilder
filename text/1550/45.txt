Slitherlink
Double Trouble
Ophis
Normal Slitherlink is finally back, but don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve
gotten rid of Special Slitherlink that easily. It might make a
return bigger than ever. The rules: draw a single closed loop
by vertically and horizontally joining the dots so that the
numbered squares are surrounded by the corresponding
number of lines.
A couple of quick riddles:
A) You can see three faces of each of two standard six-sided dice. You can count
27 pips in total. How many pips can you count on each die?
B) A newly-erected building has 16 apartments. The tenants want to number
them, and so they contract Fancy Golden Lettering Ltd. They are informed that
digit X costs ¬£X (so 0 is on the house). How much will they have to pay?
You know who else is back? That‚Äôs right, David Bowie. Also
Ophis. Fill the cells with a continuous line that does not pass
through a cell twice, doesn‚Äôt intersect with itself, and passes
through all white boxes. The numbers show you how many
times the line turns in the corresponding row or column. The
snake enters and exits the grid at the shown points (and only
those points). There are some hints to get you started.

tween any two islands.
Each island indicates
the number of bridges
