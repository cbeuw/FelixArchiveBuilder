RYOTA ICHINOSE TALKS ABOUT HIS DOUBLE LIFE
AT IMPERIAL AND THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MUSIC
Ryota Ichinose is a violinist and a fi-
nal year undergraduate on the 4-year
BSc Physics and Music Performance
programme, taught jointly by Imperial
and the RCM. He told us about how he
balances two demanding disciplines in
the same time most of us take to study
one subject!
Phoenix: So you’re a student on the
joint Physics and Music course at Im-
perial. That’s quite an unusual com-
bination to study. Can you tell me a
bit about why you chose it?
Ryota Ichinose: Well, the violin has al-
ways been a big part of my life. I started
playing when I was five years old, and
it helped me a lot as I grew up. For ex-
ample, when I first came to England,
when I was ten, I couldn’t speak any
English. But when I played the violin, I
could get some respect from other peo-
ple, I wasn’t just this person who can’t
speak English. So the violin’s always
been part of my life. In terms of phys-
ics, I’ve always excelled at physics dur-
ing school, I really enjoyed it. So when
I heard about this course, it just seemed
perfect.
P: Has it been difficult to find the time
to devote to both music and physics?
RI: To some extent, yes, because phys-
ics itself requires sole concentration, so
when I’m revising for physics exams I
don’t practice much violin, and when
I’m preparing for a music exam I don’t
do much physics. At the RCM [Royal
College of Music], I have to compete
with people who study solely music,
who practice about 8 hours a day, and
that’s something I just can’t do because
I don’t have the time. So it is difficult,
yes.
P: Do you have any plans for when
you finish your degree? Do you want
to continue with music, or physics, or
try to combine both somehow?
RI: I’m going on to a Masters next year,
but in nanotechnology, which is kind of
unrelated to music. I chose it because
of my final year project, which I really
enjoyed. I do think it’s a bit of a shame
that I won’t actually be studying mu-
sic any more, but I won’t just quit the
violin. I’ll try to join some orchestras,
or maybe even organise some solo con-
certs if I can.
P: Did you consider doing postgradu-
ate studies in music?
RI: Well, if you want to become a pro-
fessional violinist, that requires a lot of
practice, and despite the fact that I re-
ally enjoy playing the violin, and I actu-
ally enjoyed preparing for my last vio-
lin exams, I don’t think I can live under
that kind of stress for my entire life. So
no, perhaps not for me.
P: Do you ever find it difficult to
switch between the very logical and
analytical kind of mindset you need
for physics, and the more expressive
and creative musical side?
RI: Yes, I find that I have difficulty in
interactions with friends at Imperial —
because their brains work so logically,
sometimes I can’t convey my musical
and artistic thoughts to them. And it’s
actually vice versa with music. In mu-
sic lessons, some of the things they say
are more about feelings than logical
thought processes, and how you can use
music to convey those feelings. With
physics it’s more about logical steps,
one after another. So they’re very dif-
ferent.
P: Can you tell me a bit about the
course, about how much time you
spend on the different aspects of it?
Is it about 50/50 between physics and
music?
RI: In the first year it was mainly phys-
ics, but as you progress it gets to be
more and more music, and I believe this
year it’s 70% music and 30% physics.
It’s actually quite tough, because you’re
essentially doing two bachelor degrees
at once. I complete all the usual physics
modules that a BSc student would do
in three years, but for me it’s four years
because of the music. So time manage-
ment is really key.
P: So is it a good course? Would you
recommend it?
RI: I’d definitely recommend it. If
you’re like me, if you work harder you
feel better about yourself afterwards.
And you’re developing your artistic and
your analytical mind at the same time,
and I believe in the future that will help
me in some ways. It gives you an edge
basically, because not many people
have that sort of background.
P: It is quite unusual. Do you feel
there’s any connection between the
two things? Does being a musician
make you a better scientist in any
way, or does being a scientist make
you approach your music different-
ly?
RI: I think there have been studies that
often found that people who are good
musicians are also good mathemati-
cians. But I haven’t really thought
about it to any deep extent. But there’s
some kind of connection there, maybe.
P: Who’s your favourite composer, or
favourite style of music?
RI: Within the framework of the kind of
classical music you learn at the RCM,
I’d say I like the Romantic music the
best. I regard myself as quite an emo-
tional guy, I like conveying my feelings
when I’m playing my violin, and I like
it when other people do that too. So
that’s why I find the modern stuff a bit
pretentious. But I listen to other kinds
of music as well.
P: Do you think Imperial’s a good
place for people interested in arts and
music? Do you think there’s a good
community for that kind of thing?
RI: If you regard music as a hobby, not
a profession, then Imperial provides a
good environment. You can have a lot
of fun. There’s a very good symphony
orchestra, which I’m a part of, and I
think it’s been rated as one of the top
in the UK, some time ago. I think Im-
perial has the most societies out of any
universities in the UK — there’s lots of
stuff going on!
