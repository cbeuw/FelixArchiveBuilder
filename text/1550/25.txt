who are just astoundingly good, and I
could never be like them. But people
like Al Reynolds, Charlie Stross, Paul
McAwley, Stephen Baxter, they are
more in the department of what I’m try-
ing to do. But they’ve spent a lot more
time building up their writing careers,
and I’ve spent my time building up an
academic career.
P: Do you have any plans to write a
novel for publication?
DC: I am writing one at the moment,
going through the revisions at this
stage. We’ll see how that goes!
P: Why did you choose to write sci-
ence fiction rather than another gen-
re or more mainstream fiction?
DC: I’ve been in the science fiction
world for a long time. When I was a
student here I ran the science fiction
society, and from that I got involved
in what’s known as the science fiction
fandom. I’ve run conventions, and it’s
also what I read. But that doesn’t mean
I haven’t got the ideas for some more
mainstream stories, novels, floating
around in my mind.
P: What do you think about the
“lablit” genre? Do you think that’s
going to become a big thing?
DC: I’ve published a few things on the
Lablit.com site. I know Jenny Rohn,
who runs it, and I like what she’s doing,
but I feel she draws the line between
science fiction and “lablit” a little bit
too rigidly, and there’s a lot more com-
monality between the two. The prob-
lem, at least in the UK, with science
fiction is the old “two cultures”, where
frankly literature-based literary critics
are scared of science. They can’t tell
what’s made up and what’s not. They
don’t like science very much, so they
don’t have a basis to understand it, and
so they denigrate the whole thing.
P: Do you think modern science fic-
tion is becoming more literary, espe-
cially in the short fiction world, with
places like Clarkesworld publishing
work quite literary in style?
DC: There’s always a space for that.
Maybe the fact that I’ve never managed
to get anything into Clarkesworld dem-
onstrates that perhaps they are more lit-
erary! There’s always been a spectrum,
with people like Jeff Ryman, who were
much more literary than people like Ar-
thur C. Clarke, even though they were
writing at the same time. It’s not a hard
solidly delineated “you’re one thing or
the other” — there’s a shading.
P: What would you say was your
proudest achievement as a writer?
DC: If I was wearing my science fiction
fan hat, it would be the Analog story
[A War of Stars, published in Analog
magazine]. But bearing in mind that I’m
sitting in my office here at Imperial, it
would be the Nature story [Last of the
Guerrilla Gardeners, published in Na-
ture]. I came this close to having my
Nature Futures story in the same issue
that I had a paper that I co-authored. Un-
fortunately we didn’t manage to swing
it, but that would have been fun.
P: Finally, what advice would you give
to students or young scientists who
want to combine writing or other cre-
ative pursuits with a scientific career?
DC: Keep doing it. Writing, whether
it’s a scientific paper, a piece of fiction,
a nonfiction article, or a lab report, the
more you practice communicating in the
written form, the better you will get at it.
I imagine that’s also true for visual arts,
for acting, for, well, for doing science! If
you want to do something, you get bet-
ter at it by doing it. Not by reading about
doing it, not by watching movies about
people who are doing it, but by doing it.
So keep on keeping on.
