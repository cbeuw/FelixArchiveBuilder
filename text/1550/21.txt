hey came for
‘Percy Thrower’
last night. I was
on my way to de-
liver some Pink
Brandywine to-
mato seeds when
I saw the first po-
lice car. I turned
the corner and
saw a fleet of them parked outside her
house, complete with sniffer dogs and a
space-suited forensic team heading for
her potting shed.
I averted my eyes and walked past
on the opposite side of the road, feeling
the envelope of illegal seeds in my pack

GUERILLA
GARDENERS

Scientific sense
was never going
to stand up to
irate politicians
shouting
“Something must
be done!”
“ broadcast my guilt. As I left her road,
the sterilization van arrived, its flame
throwers ready to destroy ‘Percy’s’ ir-
replaceable collection of plants.
I got away. The others weren’t so
lucky.
As I waited for the bus I checked our
secure server and realized they were
rolling up the whole network. ‘Monty’
had been the first, but in catapulting a
package of herb seeds into Buckingham
Palace gardens he’d gone too far. His ar-
rest had been the trigger for raids across
the country. ‘Bob’ had sent out a warn-
ing as they smashed down his door, but
they’d been ready for us all. If I hadn’t
been on a delivery run they’d’ve caught
me as well.
I couldn’t go home. Most of the peo-
ple I trusted had been picked up. I stayed
on the bus as it passed my stop and
headed into central London. The clean-
up crews were obvious, torching col-
lections of wild flowers in the roadside
beds that I’d seeded from bus windows
while commuting.
All the hard work, all the beautiful,
irreplaceable diversity, stamped out by
commercial greed. If I’d’ve had the ma-
chinery with me I’d’ve leapt off the bus
and seeded the palace gardens myself.
‘Percy’ had started the whole thing
with a few prophetic words:
“Biology is the biggest peer-to-peer
copying system on the planet. Now
they’ve eliminated file sharing they’ll
come for the seed sharers.”
She’d been a university botanist for
years but left when it became clear that
all the grants were controlled by big ag-
ribusiness. We knew we were in trouble
when Kew was sold off and Henry Dou-
bleday broken up. Their vast seed col-
lections became the intellectual property
of a few huge corporations. Unlicensed
seeds were already illegal to sell, but
once companies owned the rare strains,
they stopped collectors sharing them for
free. They wanted to control it all.
At first we tried to stop them. There
were protests, lobbies and mass march-
es. Gardener’s Question Time became
such a political hot potato it was can-
celled by the BBC. And then came the
Chelsea Flower-Show Riots.
When I got off the bus I saw the police
at the station. But it was just the usual
patrols, not yet a manhunt. Maybe word
of my escape had yet to reach them. I
headed for Left Luggage.
We were called economic terror-
ists, threatening profits from high-cost,
highyield, terminator-gene strains that
would feed the world and soak up ex-
cess CO2
. But we just wanted tasty veg-
etables from our own gardens, unusual
flowers smelling as good as they looked,
and the opportunity to eat the occasional
purple carrot. Serious action only came
when self-propagating super-plants
were found growing by a road in Nor-
folk.
“Businessmen don’t understand that
biology is a lot messier than digital
copying,” ‘Percy’ had said as we talked
in her potting shed. “There’s a dozen
perfectly natural ways the terminator
gene might have failed. One cosmic ray
taking out the right base pair would be
enough!”
But scientific sense was never going
to stand up to irate politicians shouting
“Something must be done!”
Fines became prison sentences, the
Seed Squads were established and we
were forced underground. Home gar-
dens were no longer safe, so we became
guerrilla gardeners — a secret society
sharing seeds and planting contraband
crops in public spaces.
We tended them at night or just scat-
tered seeds far and wide to let nature
take its course. That’s when the network
started and we adopted our noms de
vert.
We were too successful. Nature was
indeed the great copier. Our wilder
strains could fend for themselves and
started to spread.
The gloves finally came off when the
director of Smaxo’s agricultural divi-
sion found a clump of illegal Afghan
Purple carrots growing at the bottom of
his garden and carpeted the Prime Min-
ister. Of course, ‘Monty’ and his cata-
pult didn’t help.
Now the only guerrilla gardener left
is me.
I collected my escape stash from Left
Luggage along with Monty’s seed cata-
pult. The wig, hat and glasses helped
me slip past the tighter police patrols
and onto the sleeper to Fort William.
Locked in my cabin I shaved my dis-
tinctive beard and used clippers so that
I’d match the fake ID in my stash.
The train would go through a lot of
isolated country. The clean up crews
couldn’t cover all that ground in one
season, so some of my seeds were going
out of the window.
As for the rest…
There are islands off the Scottish coast
contaminated by bioweapons testing
from the Second World War. People are
forbidden and there are no sheep or rab-
bits. But their climate is ideal. The seed
catapult has enough range to reach them
from a boat offshore.
Or I could land and make certain
they’re properly planted. The seeds will
do well on the islands, even if I don’t.
In a few years they’ll become a reserve
for natural, noncommercial diversity
no matter what happens to me, the last
guerrilla gardener.
