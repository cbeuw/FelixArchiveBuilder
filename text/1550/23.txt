ance is about creative expression.
Dance can be narrative art and storytell-
ing. Dance can be about structure, dis-
cipline and perfection in every detail, or
it can be about improvisation, spontane-
ity and exploration. There aren’t many
forms of art that are so versatile or that
so well illustrate the intersections be-
tween different types of creativity. Es-
pecially when the dancers themselves
are also scientists and engineers. That’s
why on a bright but cold Sunday morn-
ing this May, members of the Imperial
D
College Union Dance Company gath-
ered on campus to help create a photo-
shoot for this magazine. From the his-
toric backdrop of the Queen’s Tower to
the blue-glass mirrored exterior of the
Faculty building, Imperial’s campus —
with its contrasts and contradictions —
provided the ideal location. The dancers
demonstrated graceful classical ballet
poses alongside dynamic contempo-
rary techniques. The images we created
show how beautiful the different forms
of dance can be. They also speak of the
strength, flexibility, balance and athleti-
cism required, developed through many
hours of dedicated practice.
