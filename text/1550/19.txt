FIRE
by Cosmin Badea
The flames burn â€” orange and yellow.
All that we have lived, in flames.
Black is the sky, black the future
Only this moment burns lively
Orange and yellow.
Fire has now touched
The memory of that moment
When we met.
What we once felt, in flames.
White were we once, black is the ash
Only a corner of the sad reflection is still burning
Orange and yellow.
Catching fire now
That kiss
Which alone stopped the eternal.
Sweet was your mouth, black is the pain.
My seared lips taste the death of ages
Still the fire rages...
Fire on the forest
Of our own dreamt dreams
Fire on the lake, the house,
Fire in our house...
Fire on the hearth
Fire on the hearth...
Alone and afraid
In a lonesome corner
A lost, wasted child.
Crying and attempting
To put out with teardrops
Such a fire wild.
Somewhere, far away,
Alone and forlorn
A girl that he haunts.
Her eyes shut and teary,
No more tears to cry
No more hope she wants.
But the fire only
Lives while it has feed
Hope as oxygen,
It has starved completely my
Lungs already starving.
The last drop of hope falls burning
Orange and yellow.
After infinity comes infinity.
(Anything burns, everything!)
For an eternity the cold fire's been rising
But it has even burned its flames
Which it had as wings in its flight
From me, towards me.
After it, the silence.
