sidered ‘women’s work’; dominated by
women, they are lumped together as
‘handicrafts’
, a genre completely sepa-
rate – and far inferior – to the male-
dominated ‘ﬁne arts’
. he Feminist Art
movement of the 1970s tried to address
this attitude by elevating the decorative
arts to the level of the ﬁne arts, a mis-
sion that reached its zenith with Judy
Chicago’s 1979 piece he Dinner Party,
in which place settings are laid out for
39 great women from history. Hand-
crafted table runners celebrated these
women’s achievements, while the plates
were decorated with images of butter-
flies and flowers, symbolic of vulvas, all
in an eﬀort to celebrate the decorative
arts.
Unfortunately, very little has changed,
and the hierarchy of the arts continues
in the way described by Le Corbusier
in 1918: ‘Decorative arts at the bottom,
and the human form at the top. Because
we are men’
.
his focus on female artists often
prompts the tired question ‘why are
there no great female artists?’ It is a fair
question? Where is the female equiva-
lent of Botticelli? Turner? Picasso? he
answer to this question will largely de-
pend on who you ask.
If you ask the Evening Standard art
critic Brian Sewell, he might tell you
that ‘only men are capable of aesthetic
greatness’
, and that women’s inability
to create art could be ‘something to do
with bearing children’
. If you ask Georg
Baselitz, one of Germany’s leading
painters, he might tell you that ‘women
don’t paint very well. It’s a fact’
, backing
up this claim with the fact that ‘they
don’t pass the market test’
, despite work
by impressionist Berthe Morisot being
more than twice as expensive as his
own.
However,ifyouaskLindaNochlin,art
historian at New York University, you
might have a rather diﬀerent response.
Her 1971 essay, ‘Why have there been
no great women artists?’
, argues that
the lack of great female art is a result of
centuries of oppression against women.
Historically, the art studio, like many
aspects of life, was closed to women, a
male-dominated world.
he very few pre-19th century female
artists are often daughters of other fa-
mous painters, such as Artemisia Gen-
tileschi, daughter of Orazio Gentileschi,
best known for her visceral work Judith
Slaying Holofernes. hese women were
able to break out of the rigid social
norms of the time thanks to their po-
sition and influence, but how can there
be a legacy of great female painters if
there is no way for women to access the
arts?
For an example closer to home, we
need do no more than walk down to
Green Park and visit the Royal Acad-
emy; founded in 1768 to ‘promote the
arts of design in Britain’
, it took another
century until the ﬁrst women enrolled,
in 1860. Even then, women were barred
from life drawing until 1893, and even
then the subject had to be partially
clothed. It was not until 1936, nearly
200 years after it was founded, that a
woman was elected to the Royal Acad-
emy. With such constraints placed on
their training, it is hardly surprising that
we have no female Turner.
Another subject Nochlin touches
upon in her essay is the idea of the
‘golden-nugget theory of genius’; within
art history there is a tradition, stretch-
ing back centuries, of the ‘genius artist’
,
plucked from obscurity and somehow
destined to make masterpieces. hey
possessed the ‘golden-nugget’ of genius,
and therefore it was inevitable that this
genius would rise to the surface, and
the world would know them as a great
painter, regardless of the circumstances.
Proponents of this theory may point
to the Florentine painter Giotto, saying
‘Look! He was a mere shepherd’s boy
before somebody noticed his doodles
and took him on as an apprentice’
. hey
point at Van Gogh and argue that even
with his crippling seizures, he was still
able to produce great art. hey hold
up Picasso and screech of how he was
able to pass all the examinations for the
Madrid School of Art – an examina-
tion that normally took a month – in a
week, at the age of 15. Each example re-
inforces the idea of the ‘golden-nugget’
,
and tries to silence the feminist critic;
‘if they could do it, why couldn’t she?’
they ask. While many professors of art
history are careful to be wary about
the authenticity of such tales, the idea
of the tortured, white, male genius has
become deeply ingrained within the
public consciousness; it is a myth that
excludes females, rendering the world
of classical art as a ‘Boy’s Club’
.
‘Kathe Kollwitz’
, one of the founding
members of the Guerrilla Girls, believes
that, while the Male Gaze, and the ste-
reotype of the male genius artist have
contributed to discrimination, nothing
holds more power in the art world than
cold, hard cash. When I ask her about
the idea of the Male Gaze, she dismisses
the idea, referring instead to ‘the male
pocketbook’
.
‘Most art collectors are wealthy men
whose taste influences what artists are
exhibited and collected by museums’
,
she says; “hese men donate money
and artworks to museums and sit on
acquisition committees that help the
curators decide what art to collect. Cu-
rators don’t really need help ﬁguring
this out, but they need trustees’ money
to get the art. It doesn’t take a genius to
realize that the system is ripe for cor-
ruption since collectors can promote
acquisitions of work by artists they own,
and that in turn makes their private col-
lections more valuable”
.
Linda Nochlin has said: “hose who
have privileges inevitably hold on to
them, and hold tight, no matter how
marginal the advantage involved”
, and
when we look at the art world it is diﬃ-
cult not to see it as ‘Kathe Kollwitz’ does
– a ‘playground of the 1%’
.
hings may sound bleak, but they
are not hopeless. Organisations such
as he Guerrilla Girls, and UK Femini-
sta are tirelessly campaigning for major
galleries to display more female artists,
and ‘Kathe Kollwitz’ singles out the
Tate Modern, Stockholm’s Moderna
Museet, and the MoMA as examples
of museums that are trying to do better.
But they cannot do it alone.
In Lynn Hershman Leeson’s ﬁlm
¡Women Art Revolution!, which docu-
ments the growth of feminist art, there
is a particularly painful scene in which
people are stopped outside the MoMA
and asked to name three female artists.
None can. Could you? he subjugation
of female artists has to end; get in con-
tact with the galleries, and ask them to
address the imbalance. Find out more
about artists like Louise Bourgeois,
Tamara de Lempicka, and Cindy Sher-
man. Do not allow the plight of the fe-
male artist to be conﬁned to the annals
of history. he time for change is now!
