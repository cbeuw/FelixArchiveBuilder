Ronan, Sam Riley, Jonny Lee Miller
In this day and age when vampires of
ﬁction are all-powerful, untouchable
creatures, it’s undeniably refreshing
to have a more human spin on the
ever popular genre. Plus it’s an extra
bonus point to not have to endure a
cring inducing love subplot between
an immortal and mortal – what we
get here is something entirely diﬀer-
ent – a more patient, slow-burning
approach to telling a familiar but not
at all predictable story of supernatu-
ral beings we can’t ever stop hearing
about no matter what.
Eleanor (Ronan) is sixteen forever.
She’s a vampire, and is not allowed to
discuss with anyone her little secret –
her mother Clara (Arterton) forbids
this. So she must settle for writing
down her thoughts and feelings as
many diary entries, throwing them
away into the wind or the sea. For rea-
sons unknown to her, Ella and Clara
are constantly on the run. Whilst
providing the best for her daughter in
the only way she knows how, by pleas-
ing men, Clara is a loyal although at
times, ﬂawed protector, as with any
parent.
Turns out the only reason these
two are the most wanted vampires is
because they’re female. he vampire
society puts a lot of importance on
the word “brotherhood” and allows
no women into their group. Since
Clara and Eleanor were both created
against the rules, they need to be
removed. his explains Clara’s para-
noia, and the need to isolate them-
selves wherever they go, whereas with
Eleanor, who is kept in the dark about
most of this, doesn’t understand.
For the past couple of centuries, El-
eanor seems to have been a good, dis-
ciplined girl. Now she’s ﬁnally getting
the courage to stand up for herself
and rebel (and about time, too). She
meets a boy, joins some college class-
es, and soon the secrets start spilling
themselves. And as she tells her story,
we are shown, in many ﬂashback se-
quences, just how everything came
about.
Director Neil Jordan takes his time
to give us the full picture – he knows
how much to tell when, and more im-
portantly, he knows when to make the
cuts – leaving the narrative hanging.
He doesn’t give anything away too
easily, and with this air of mystery
and intrigue, this becomes a vampire
ﬁlm that’s far more entertaining and
smarter than the norm. he two par-
allel plot-lines here serve to further
the two females’ nature.
Arterton is absolutely spot-on as
Clara; and winding the clock back
to the 19th Century, we see the long,
complicated and painful process she
had to endure to end up where she is
now – and even as an immortal she’s
failed to ﬁnd peace. Arterton is loud,
forceful and assertive, and has no
problem tapping into the seductive
side of her role given some very sug-
gestive items of clothing she wears.
But underneath all the conﬁdence
and tough exterior, there’s an obvious
inner layer of weakness and vulnera-
bility. With no allies she is on her own
to look out for her family. Very little
kindness was shown to her all her life,
so we understand her need for utmost
control.
In contrast to her mother, Eleanor
is a quieter, more restrained presence
on the screen, one that Ronan cap-
tures beautifully. She’s sheltered and
naïve, qualities that make her bud-
ding, awkward romance with Frank
(Caleb Landry Jones – who looks so
pale he could well be a vampire him-
self) all the more sweet and charm-
ing. Over the years she too has found
her speciﬁc ways to cope with her
need for feeding, one that involves a
more humane, sensitive approach. It’s
fascinating to navigate in their world,
where vampires are incredibly similar
to humans and really not a lot sets
them apart.
here are several under-developed
characters as the ﬁlm is interested
solely in Arterton and Ronan. Sam
Riley in particular deserves more
screen time given his signiﬁcance to
the overall plot, and his participation
could have been enhanced for a more
exciting ﬁnale that disappointingly
ends on a bit of a ﬂat note. Jonny Lee
Miller lends his talent to play the vile
antagonist, whereas Daniel Mays puts
in an appearance to add a touch of
comedy to the otherwise overall seri-
ous tone.
Because of its overall glum tone as
well as its slow-burning approach to
tell its dense story, there will be lim-
ited appeal to young adults looking
for a quick action ﬁx. In fact there is
very little in the way of fast, kinetic
showdowns, but the ﬁlm more than
makes up for this in its unique way of
portraying its vampires.
The same meal every
single day must get boring
I’m so tired of drinking
the same thing every day. I
miss tea, oh, and cocktails
