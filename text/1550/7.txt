“You asked me once, what was in
Room 101. I told you that you knew
the answer already. Everyone knows
it. he thing that is in Room 101 is the
worst thing in the world.”
Room 101: a setting from Orwell’s
Nineteen Eighty-Four, the room where
everyone’s worst fear is contained. For
the protagonist Winston Smith it was
rats. For others it might be as sensible
as snakes, or as bizarre as flowers. Say
what you will, but everyone has some
sort of fear.
Or do they? In the United States
a woman, known only as S.M., has
Urbach-Wiethe (UW) disease, an in-
credibly rare genetic disorder with
only 300 or so cases recorded in medi-
cal literature. One of the symptoms in
UW disease is the destruction of the
amygdalae, almond-shaped groups of
nuclei embedded within the brain.
he main impact of this destruction
is the complete absence of fear within
patient S.M. A group of scientists at-
tempted to scare her with, amongst
other things, poisonous snakes and
arachnids, horror ﬁlms and haunted
houses. Long story short they failed
miserably. hey couldn’t perturb S.M.
Only recently have researches found
something that does trigger a fear
response in UW suﬀerers: high con-
centrations of carbon dioxide in the
blood. he fear of suﬀocation, simu-
lated by breathing in high quantities of
carbon dioxide, prompted the patients
to feel fear for the ﬁrst time in their
lives. his suggests that the amygda-
lae, whilst important, are not exclu-
sively the domain of the fear response.
However unpleasant fear may be
S.M.’s case highlights the role it has to
play in human survival from an evo-
lutionary psychological standpoint:
S.M.’s lack of fear has led her to han-
dle dangerous animals that most sane
people would seek to avoid. Just as pain
is a protective mechanism to stop us
from inflicting further damage upon
ourselves fear probably had a role to
play in preventing early humans from
running headlong into danger. Fears
of snakes, spiders and other such crea-
tures is likely a throwback from those
times, and partly explains why people
such as Europeans still display seem-
ingly irrational fear responses towards
harmless European animals.
But what if, using knowledge from
S.M. and other UW suﬀerers, we could
‘shut oﬀ’ fear? Create super soldiers
capable of fearlessly charging into
battle? Fire ﬁghters who run head-
long into burning buildings? Despite
damage to her amygdala S.M. is oth-
erwise normal. Already people display
a complete absence of fear in certain
extraordinary situations (sometimes
called aphobia). his pushes them to
otherwise impossible extremes. Selec-
tively being able to dampen or even
eliminate fear in this manner could
prove extraordinarily useful.
Such an on/oﬀ switch to fear would
have to be carefully controlled. As
handy as such a switch might be a
complete lack of fear also means no
longer fearing death. Already serv-
ing soldiers, ﬁre ﬁghters, and those in
other high-risk occupations put their
lives on the line. Hypothetical users
of a fear switch would have to accept
that their lives would be placed at even
higher risk.
But controlling fear is still some
way oﬀ. As the case of S.M. shows the
amygdala plays a large role in con-
trolling fear, but its function would
need to be clearly understood before
it could be eﬃciently turned on and
oﬀ ‘as needed’. In the meantime you’ll
just have to man up and ignore that in-
nocent garden spider in the corner of
your room. he little guy isn’t going to
hurt you.
