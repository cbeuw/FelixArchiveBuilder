FRIDAY 07 JUNE
This paper is also taken for the enigmatic and mysterious Examination for the Associateship
BSc/MSci Examination June 2012
Question 1
Observe the gentleman in Figure I to
the right. As you are well aware, I have
stated on many occasions in lectures that
the historical figures behind the key ide-
as of this course are completely unex-
aminable. Unfortunately for you, I lied.
In that spirit, answer the following:
i) Who is this man? [1 mark]
ii) How is he related to the key ideas
of this course? [3 marks]
iii) Following on from the previous
parts, write an extensive essay on
a topic you have not revised exten-
sively. [70 marks]
Keep in mind that your answer to Part
iii) is weighted in such a manner that it
renders your answers to all other ques-
tions completely meaningless.
ELECTROMAGNETISM, PROBABILITY
& WELDING CONCEPTS
ANSWER ALL PARTS OF SECTION D, THEN EXACTLY TWO THIRDS OF SECTION B
FOLLOWED BY SEVEN EIGHTHS OF SECTION Y. THEN DO A HANDSTAND.
Figure I: A Victorian man, whose visage
you will most likely despise during and
hopefully beyond this examination.
Question 2
The Minister of State for Faith and Com-
munities Baroness Warsi has challenged
you to a high stakes game of Noughts
and Crosses. Being a free spirited indi-
vidual, you allow her the privilege of
playing first. She plays as crosses. The
game is currently in the stage as dem-
onstrated in Figure II. You are playing
to win, but you can’t help but shake the
feeling that Baroness Warsi might throw
the game away at any moment.
i) Can you win the game? [0.5 marks]
ii) What topics of conversation would
you consider bringing up during such
a game? Remember that the game
is high stakes. [0.01 marks]
iii) How would you adjust your strat-
egy if the game was Snakes & Lad-
ders instead? Justify your answer.
[0.27 marks]
Figure II: A poorly played game of
Noughts and Crosses.
YOU WARSI
Question 3
In a recent interview with Vulture, Hol-
lywood alien vanquisher and one-time
Ethos user Will Smith (Figure III) pos-
ited his theory on everything:
“At heart, I’m a physicist. I look at eve-
rything in my life as trying to find the
single equation, the theory of every-
thing.”
i) What is the single equation - the
theory of everything? [100 marks]
[Hint: You may only score either zero
marks or full marks. I don’t expect
you to get far with this one. In fact
I expect you to stress a lot over this
question, while I enjoy your torment
and anguish at the front of the exam-
ination room. If you can answer this
though, you’re guaranteed a first.
Good luck!]

fice champion Will Smith.
Question 4
As always, we as a department are look-
ing for ways to make your examination
period easier to bear. One of our new
alterations to the syllabus is therefore
focused on arbitrarily harnessing your
own artistic (rather than scientific) crea-
tivity:
i) Draw a dinosaur of your own
choosing in the designated empty
box to the right [0 marks]
[Hint: There are no marks for this
question, but we hope you will at-
tempt it anyway, even if you are run-
ning out of time. If not, the examiners
may have to express their disap-
pointment in the obligatory exam-
iners’ reports. We are sure that the
examiners would vaguely appreciate
sketches of dinosaurs to improve the
experience of marking hundreds of
scripts.]
