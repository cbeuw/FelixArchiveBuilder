Friday, 24th of May: a rainy day in
London, what else would you expect?
But 12 brave, hiking loving students
were ready to leave for Pembro-
keshire, Wales on a Fellwanderers
weekend trip. Since it was a bank
holiday weekend, it took us quite
a while to get to Wales. But by the
time we arrived, it stopped raining
and although some were still scepti-
cal about the weather, we trusted in
the weather forecast for the weekend
that it would be sunny and set up our
tents.
Saturday we drove to St David’s
(Britain’s smallest city) and started
our tour along the cliﬀs to the ﬁshing
village of Solva and Newgale Sands
beach. We had a relaxed walk with
a few stops to admire the beautiful
cliﬀs and the landscape. For lunch we
enjoyed ﬁsh and chips and ice-cream,
the favourite food over the weekend.
he weather did not disappoint us,
the Sun was shining and at the end
almost everybody got sunburnt and
the ﬁrst thing we did after ﬁnishing
our tour, was going to the supermar-
ket to buy sun cream. We also bought
food for the next days and had a great
barbecue that evening at our camp-
site (Trefalen Farm, by Broad Haven
beach).
We were woken up by the sun-
shine on Sunday morning. It was so
hot in the tent that no one wanted to
be inside anymore. After breakfast
we started a beach sightseeing tour
from Manorbier castle, along the
coast. We were walking from beach
to beach, sunbathing and the tough-
est going swimming in each one.
While playing Frisbee and throwing
the Nerf around, nobody cared about
the freezing cold water. At the last
beach we split up. Some relaxed at
the beach; others went back to the
camp site and the rest took a walk
near a lily pond. here were so many
lilies but it was too early for them
to bloom, so we only saw the leaves.
In the evening we rejoined to have
another barbecue and to watch the
moon rise as night drew in.
Monday morning we woke up to
totally diﬀerent weather. he wind
was blowing so strong, that we feared
we would be blown away with the
whole tent! Hence the ﬁrst challenge
of the day was getting the tent down
and not being blown away. And to
make it even worse, it was starting to
rain as well… but we completed our
challenge.
After a little discussion, about
what we could do for a walk, we de-
cided to make a short walk, about an
hour, along the cliﬀs from the Green
Bridge of Wales (a large rock archway
extending out into the stormy sea) to
St Govan’s chapel. his was enough
to make everyone soaking wet! We
had our lunch in the chapel which is
built into the side of the cliﬀs. After
changing into dry clothes, we went
to the minibus and set oﬀ to ﬁnd a
coﬀee shop to warm us up. his was
the second challenge of the day. Af-
ter looking for a café in a castle and
ﬁnding out that there wasn’t one, we
drove by a nice modern coﬀee shop,
stopped and had some nice teas,
scones and hot chocolate. And then
it was time to get back to London….
