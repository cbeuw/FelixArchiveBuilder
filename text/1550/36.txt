Let us all cleanse our souls
Whether what this ﬁlm suggests is
actually feasible is an entirely sepa-
rate matter – would an annual 12-
hour period in which all crimes are
allowed really help decrease Ameri-
ca’s crime rate and solve unemploy-
ment? During these hours even the
emergency services do not respond,
and it turns into a free-for-all Battle
Royale/Hunger Games in which the
population is given the chance to get
all violence and hatred out of their
system.
he year is 2022, and “he Purge”
has truly turned things around, with
the United States becoming a nation
reborn thanks to this little cleansing
process. James (Hawke) and Mary
(Headey) don’t take part in this rit-
ual (as is their right), and tradition-
ally hide out in their proudly fortiﬁed
mansion, choosing not to get in-
The Purge
Director: James DeMonaco
Screenwriter: James DeMonaco
Starring: Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey,
Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane
volved, but fully supporting the idea
of “he Purge”. heir children Zoey
(Kane) and Charlie (Burkholder) are a
little too young, naïve and idealistic
to fully comprehend the need for this
yearly event (and to be quite frank,
the audience won’t be fully sold on
this idea either) but it’s the world they
live in now, and they need to learn to
deal with it.
So “he Purge” starts bang on time
at 7pm with a loud horn signalling
the beginning of all things criminal,
and ends at 7am sharp, giving the
public plenty of time to unleash the
monsters within. hings seem to be
going well for James’ family, with the
patriarch feeling conﬁdent that their
state-of-the-art brand new security
systems will keep out anyone who
roams through the streets looking for
trouble.
But having dumb, useless children
is certainly this family’s massive
downfall. When their youngest Char-
lie sees a Bloody Stranger (Edwin
Hodge – this is his credited character
name) crying out for help, the kind-
hearted idiot lets the man in. Turns
out he’s been running away from an
insane gang of masked youths who
are exercising their Constitutional
right to purge. his gang means busi-
ness, all of them wielding deadly
weapons, dressed to kill, aching for
some blood to be spilled. James’ fam-
ily has been thrown into this tur-
moil, and as these youngsters start
a siege and an eventual home inva-
sion, since their defence system re-
ally isn’t all that great, they are left to
ﬁght and fend for themselves; as until
7am, there will be no help coming
their way. Adding to this is another
troublesome oﬀspring of theirs: the
daughter – and her boyfriend who
snuck his way into the house for some
mischievous action of his own.
Despite the initially intriguing
premise of this annual ritual, the ﬁlm
doesn’t actually spend too much time
on having a closer look at the event
itself. As is the case with all stand-
ard home invasion movies, the lights
go oﬀ, there are many sharp corners,
the bad guys are coming in from all
directions, and the good guys are
at a tremendous disadvantage. he
build-up isn’t so well handled, with
very little and largely generic char-
acter development for the family dy-
namic. Headey is much less interest-
ing here without her Queen Regent
Cersei Lannister’s sharp dialogue or
costumes, and Hawke is as smoothly
convincing as he always is, although
he isn’t allowed to give much range to
his performance.
However when the blood-thirsty,
psychotic gang does break in, it’s all
tremendously fun. It’s intriguing to
see what the ordinary citizens are
capable of – when the beast is un-
leashed – to protect their families
and this is what the ﬁlm tries to ex-
plore. Hawke is fantastic when he
brings out the demons, which is really
what the ﬁlm tries to explore – just to
what lengths can a family man go to
without betraying what he stands for?
Both James and Mary are clear in the
start that they’re not a violent part of
“he Purge”, and it’s interesting to see
how dangerously close they get to the
line they wish not to cross.
And it’s this theme the ﬁlm should
have focused on more. But opting
out of portraying depth and instead
choosing to go down the easy route
of simple violence and loud crashes
and thuds, what it eventually boils
down to is something familiar. It ends
on an outrageous and somewhat hys-
terically bizarre twist, one that fur-
ther conﬁrms the ﬁlm has very little
character consistency whatsoever.
