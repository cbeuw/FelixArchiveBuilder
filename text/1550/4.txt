perial exhibited a job prospect score
of 84, superseding all competition (the
London School of Economics was close
at hand with a score of 82; being within
walking distance of the city, a global
ﬁnancial powerhouse has its beneﬁts).
he pitfall seems to be the road that
a student must travel in order to ob-
tain an Imperial degree. Many an un-
savoury moment of staring at a blank
page must be endured. Given that
each and every student here at Impe-
rial College has to experience this on a
recurrent basis, this might rationalise
depleted student satisfaction.
Numerous other scores inhibited the
overall score of the College, including
expenditure per student head and a
meagre “Value added” score of 6.7/10
(versus University of St. Andrews’
leading 8/10). his arguably is where
scepticism begins to creep in among
staﬀ and students at the College; the
score takes people’s grades before and
after university and sees if the univer-
sity has ‘added value’ by improving the
student’s academic abilities. his has
become a hot topic of debate before,
with many students arguing it could
lead to grade inflation by universities.
his would raise the score by it looking
as if the university had made the stu-
dents perform better in assessments.
he general use of satisfaction by stu-
dents has been controversial as to how
accurate it is at measuring how good a

RCC Awards announced

university is.
Inspection of endowment does bring
some surprising results. As of July
2012 the endowment of Imperial Col-
lege London was in the region of £79
million. Contrast this with Oxford’s
£3.7 billion endowment, viable of bail-
ing out a small European Union state.
Compare this furthermore with Har-
vard University’s $30.4 billion endow-
ment (around £20 billion). It becomes
apparent that Imperial College London
is punching above its weight, produc-
ing world class students and research
on a budget comparable to the spare
change in the pockets of some other
academic institutions. Couple this
with the ability of the College to attract
a multitude of highly-skilled students
from overseas and perhaps the for-
tunes of Imperial are not all doom and
gloom.
he league table by the Guardian
makes student satisfaction the centre-
piece of the academic dinner table. It
would appear, from surveys for other
league tables (by the Times Higher
Education Supplement), that students
think that the fault of many Depart-
ments within the College is to suﬀo-
cate students with a massive academic
workload.
Interestingly, the “Entry Tariﬀ” for
Imperial was the third highest in the
country. his is the UCAS points score
that students at the university achieve.
Above Imperial are Cambridge and
Oxford.
he Guardian also released their in-
dividual subject tables, showing what
university it considers the best for vari-
ous subjects. he fortunes of the dif-
ferent subjects were extremely mixed.
Some doing extremely poorly, and
some coming out on top. Earth and
Marine Sciences was rated number one
in the country, with 94% of students
being in a career after six months.
Mechanical Engineering was also top,
with an average entry tariﬀ that stood
head and shoulders above the rest.
Civil Engineering took second place,
behind UCL’s equivalent. EEE, General
Engineering (this speciﬁc course is not
oﬀered at Imperial and so this is likely
to be an amalgamation of the engineer-
ing subjects), Materials, and Chemical
Engineering all came third. Physics
came ﬁfth, with the percentage of stu-
dents satisﬁed with the feedback (64%)
being the main distinguishing factor
between Imperial and the other cours-
es. Feedback again hit Mathematics,
who were seventh. Medicine came in
ninth and had the lowest score of all
the courses for feedback – with only
47% saying they were happy. Although
this was better than King’s College
London, who managed to score an im-
pressively poor 18%. Chemistry and
Biosciences were the two worst per-
forming at Imperial. Chemistry were
in 12th, with satisfaction with teach-
ing, feedback, and the course seem-
ingly dragging down the rating. Bio-
sciences performed the worst by quite
a margin: they came 25th in the subject
table. Again it appeared to be satisfac-
tion that caused the problems.
he Guardian league tables are pub-
lished yearly. Research performed by
economists at Royal Holloway found
that improving a Department’s overall
score in the Guardian’s league table
was linked with an increase in applica-
tions. Studying the UCAS data and the
league tables published by the Guard-
ian from 2004 onwards showed that
an increase in the overall score by one
standard deviation saw an average 4.8%
increase in applications. his only ap-
plied to Departments at the top of the
table. he authors of the paper said:
“Universities cannot aﬀord to neglect
their performance on league tables
so long as they wish to establish and
maintain a consistent reputation to at-
tract the best of students.”
