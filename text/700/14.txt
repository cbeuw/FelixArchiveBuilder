Christopher Carney and Lucy Bethune in Death and the
Maiden, one of the works currently being performed by the
Ballet Rambert at Saddler's Wells.
CREVIEWS
BALLET
Wednesday 13 March saw the
start of the Ballet Rambert's
annual three week season at
Sadler's Wells. Each night
three sets are shown out of a
total of eight. T h e first
programme contained the
popular and visually enjoyable
Sergeant Early's Dream.
It is based on Irish/American
folk music and the Irish
peasants migration to the new
world, showing scenes of
peasant life. Prominent are the
aspects of youth, love and
bravery and sadness in leaving
for the New World. These
scenes are interspersed rather
unfluently with comic scenes
of young love, flirting girls and
drunkeness. Some of the
m o v e m e n t s a r e c l e v e r l y
choreographed and wonderful
to watch.
The music is performed by a
small group on stage with
madolin, fiddle and pipes and
made up of members from
'Carrig' and 'Incantation'.
SINGLES
The Smiths: Shakespeare's
Sister
T h e e v e r - p r e t e n t i o u s
Morrisey (I'm not the only
one!) wails on as usual. Still,
you have to admit, this is
better than the usual banal
stuff—In fact were it not for
the voice this'd probably be
OK. 'Psychobilly' is probably
the only way to describe it.
Slade: Mysterious Mizster
Jones
Really exciting. S l a d e y
without being O T T . Gary
Glitter 1985 feel. Probably the
best single I've heard forages.
Actually it's rubbish almost.
And do you know what I hate
most of all about it? All those
stupid wallies that go around
j o i n i n g in with all t h e
Mysterious Mizster Jones.
Aaaargh!
Amil Stewart: That Loving
Feeling
Follow-up to Friends—but
n o t h i n g like it. T y p i c a l
musak—lift music. It's been
described as winding down
music for after a party. I'm not
sure whether that's because
you don't care what you're
listening to when you're
clearing up crap or whether
you need to be pissed to enjoy
it. I never even noticed when it
finished.
There is singing and group
dances based on traditional
country dances, which all
helps to induce a gipsy
atmosphere.
The second dance was not
so well received. Although I
enjoy hearing atonal music live
I do not think it was so well
d a n c e d . D e s c r i b e d as a
'Structural Study' based on
Indian myth, I was dis-
appointed to see the Bird God
reappear, so common in ballet.
It would appear to be a dance
more reminiscent of classical
ballet fairy tales, w h i c h
invariably need the story
explained before hand.
As, perhaps, one of the least
accessible art forms I would
say that the dancing was very
enjoyable. I was suprised to
see a high proportion of people
under twenty in the audience
and the Ballet Rambert still
made a very enjoyable evening
(although perhaps not as great
as they can be).
C o c t e a u T w i n s : Aikeau-
Guinea
Both the last single Pearly
Dewdrops Drop a n d the
album Treasure were number
one in the indie charts. This is
a l m o s t i d e n t i c a l s o it'll
p r o b a b l y d o t h e s a m e .
Droning on and on it does
little for me. All it has going for
it is the inevitable biting indie
edge!
David Grant and Jaki Graham:
Could It Be I'm Falling In Love
Having consistently failed to
beat the chart hypers with his
previous singles, this is a big
change of image to a ballad
duet with his Birmingham
singer girlfriend. A cover
version it may be but it is still
an excellent tune. It's not
trendy, it's not demanding,
but it is good music. Top ten I
reckon.
Meat Loaf: Piece Of The
Action
Remixed from his album
Bad Attitude this is clearly a
failed attempt to recreate the
epic atmosphere from BOOH.
It spends four minutes really
getting nowhere (fast?). Only
the hardened fans will buy this
but I suppose it's not so bad to
hear in the background.
BANDS
Grandmaster, Melle Mel and
The Furious Five at T h e
C a m d e n Palace. Sunday,
March 10.
Time may change the exact
name and structure of The
Furious Five, but it cannot
affect t h e i r o u t r a g e o u s
appearance, vibrant music and
keen following
People perched from every
staircase and balcony, turning
the Palace into a seething
amphitheatre of noise.
AI t h o u g h t h e s m o k e
machines took time to warm
up, Grandmaster did not.
Within half an hour, those that
had taken their lives into their
hands and crowded around
the stage had been sprayed
with champagne, subjected, to
an ear-shattering rap of 'Close
To The Edge' and encouraged
to jump, sway or slide to their
heart's content.
As well as the well known,
fast, slick music, there was also
s o m e less f u n k y stuff,
including their new single for
Ethiopia. I'd like to say that it is
destined to be a great success,
for obvious reasons, but that
just wouldn't be true. Indeed
following the marvellous Sfep
Off, it was the anti-climatic
e n d i n g to an o t h e r w i s e
memorable concert.
A scene from Dramsoc's recent production of Look Back in
Anger. The production managed to achieve the hipb standards
of most recent Dramsoc shows. Mike Bridgeland, wno played
Jimmy Porter, was superbly cynical as the angry young man.
His two women Sally Pilbrow and Elizabeth Barton, managed to
achieve the changes in mood necessary without stooping to
over acting and Ciaran Hasset, who played Cliff Lewis, was
excellent as the man caught in the middle of the argument.
