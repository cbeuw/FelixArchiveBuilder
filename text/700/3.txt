Red Ken admits
failure
Ken Livingstone and Piers
Corbyn, a former President of
ICU, spoke in the Great Hall at
Tuesday's Socialist Society
meeting. Mr Corbyn, now a
specialist on Energy Policy in the
Labour movement, began by
condemning what he described as
a 'disgraceful display of
backstabbing and back sliding' in
the wake of the failure of the
campaign in the GLC to defy the
Government's rate-capping law.
He was deeply critical of those in
the London councils who
favoured setting a rate within the
Goverment limits. Mr Corbyn
went on to speak about the
miners' strike, and criticised the
Labour Party leadership for
failing to give, proper support on
both this issue and that of rate-
capping. He attacked the closure
of coal pits on grounds other
than exhaustion.saying that once
closed a pit is always very costly
or impossible to reopen. The coal
industry is not only a valuable
employer, but also provides
Britain's only alternative to
expanding the nuclear power
programme, a prospect Mr
Corbyn abhorred.
Ken Livingstone, leader of the
GLC, then spoke in response to
Mr Corbyn's criticism, much of
which he accepted, saying of the
GLC's campaign against rate-
capping; 'Not only did we fail,
but we actually failed more
dramatically than the Govern-
ment intended us to'. He said that
he had always doubted whether
the GLC would vote for an illegal
rates policy, but that having
failed to obtain such a vote, the
London councils still have
another option: that of running a
budget deficit rather than cut
jobs and services in London.
Ken 'failed dramatically'
When questioned, he stressed
that this is not an economic
policy he would choose
nofmally, but a lesser evil than
higher unemployment and poor
housing and other services.
Mr Livingstone claimed that
although the Parliamentary
Labour Party is weak, there is a
great and increasing level of local
socialist activity; he predicted a
sudden emergence of support for
socialism and reaction against
the present Government, which
reaction, he said, will begin
before the end of this year.
The meeting closed after a
number of questions from the
floor, and a collection was taken
in aid of striking miners' families.

With only thirteen attending last
Thursday's event,Mark Glend-
enning (Chairman of the right-
wing controlled Federation Of
Conservative Students) proposed
the motion 'This house believes
in privatisation of the NHS'.
Glendenning claimed that the
formulas currently used to
allocate funds for health
spending between different
sectors were inequable.He also
criticised the organisation of the
NHS, stating that it worked 'first
and foremost in vhe interests of
the middle class administrators'.
Furthermore he complained of
the high proportion of health
spending devoted to paying
wages; he believed that more
spending is needed on equipment
such as CAT scanners and
dialysis machines, by reducing
wages. M r Glendenning,
following current fcs policy,
blamed these problems on the
fact that the NHS does not have
to compete for patients, and
proposed a system where
everybody would be issued with
vouchers which they would be
free to spend on treatment either
at an NHS hospital or a private
one.
The opposer, Peter Morris,
from The National Union Of
Public Employees, began by
numerous cases where health
authorities have found
contractors for cleaning, laundry
and other hospital services
expensive and inadequate. He
said that competition between
contractors resulted in the
recruitment of poor quality
labour,uncommitted to the
job.Following this argument, Mr
Morris defended high spending
on wages in the NHS, saying thai
well qualified health workers are
the most important component
of treatment.
After contributions from the
floor, the motion was defeated by
eleven votes to one.
Health
advice
for
foreign
travel
iThe Health Centre can provide
immunisation and health advice
for people travelling abroad.
Even for people who have lived
for long periods abroad,
particularly in tropical countries,
it may be appropriate to have
some immunisations or to take
anti-malarials, since immunity to
diseases may have diminished
during a stay in the UK.
The Health Centre emphasise
that it is important to visit the
centre well in advance of
travelling as some courses of
treatment take six weeks to
complete.
Immunisation clinics are held
on Monday, Wednesday and
Friday between 2.30 and 3.30pm
