Sailing away
Fifteen of the best teams in the
country competed in the Foot
Trophy last weekend. Individual
competitiors included several
pasi and present national and
world champions, making this
one of the premier team events
held in the UK.
Imperials first race, against
Hamble, saw a desperate last leg
attack by McClean, Jones and
Howarth converted a losing 3, 4,
6, combination into a convincing
2, 3, 5, victory. The team was off
to the best possible start.
UL2 were their opposition in
the next race, or so we were told.
Jones and Apo soon pulled clear
of the fleet while Mc CLean was
content to hold back the
opposition. Imperial finally
finished miles ahead, first,
second and fourth.
The next two races did not go
so well for Imperial a mix up
about the start against West
Kirby resulted in the team
starting late and never
recovering, whilst Wembley
surprised everyone with their
boat speed.
Irelands 'Royal St Georges G.'
were Imperials next victims
without a doubt Imperial peaked
in this race, working superbly
well together to gain first, second
and third positions.
Sunday dawned with beautiful
blue skies and a light variable
wind. The first race of the day,
against Rickmansworth, was
very closely fought with only
inches seperating all six boats at
the start. Rickmansworth finally
gained a marginal advantage,
which they protected to the
finish, 'castaways', the hosts,
appeared to be in trouble at the
start of the seventh race.
However, their superior
technique was rapidly evident as
they took the fist three positions.
The final qualifying race saw
Bennet-Clarks boat forced a
ground by a 'Nottingham
Outlaw' trying to live up to his
teams name. Some highly
dubious interpretations of the
rules concerning pumping and
rocking saw the 'Outlaws' win
comfortably.
As a result of Imperials
excellent run of results we found
ourselves qualifying for the
'Gnurds Trophy', Howarth and
Rudge showed everyone what
stars they truly are be leading the
fleet around the first mark, with
Mc Clean and Bennet-Clark and
Apo and Jones also in the top ten
of the fleet. While the standard of
rule observance appeared to
drop with the wind, so
unfortunately did the teams
positions. Never the less, the
pink and blue jackets worn by
every Imperial team member
were all seen to finish in the top
half of the fleet, a successful
finale to an excellent weekends
racing.
Casterways
cup
The annual inter-college team
championship unfortunately had
to be concelled on Saturday 23
February as the reservoir still
had several inches of ice
covering it! Imperial College, as
defenders of the cup were strong
favourites to regain its
possession—especially as they,
were the only two teams to turn
up; all the others had assumed
the reservoir to be frozen due to
the previous harsh weather!.
Saturday 2 March •
• saw the
hardened sailors trek to
Sherfield Polytechnic —x
he
winners of the Northern
Polytechnic League. Despite
such a trial, Imperial College won
the first battle. Due credit must
go to Phil Bevan and his brood
who demonstrated incredible
speed in the boats, spectacular
jiveing, and some breathtaking
rocking and rolling towards the
end.
The following morning,
dawned with mist, rain and
worse, no wind! However, all
were up early as the optimistic
(and indeed correct) captain
prophesised good sailing
prospects. By midday, the wind
-did indeed fill in, and it was then
that the team made its first
mistake—in their excessive
keaness to sail, they had
overlooked the fact that
Sherfield were not prepared, and
so almost lost the physical
advantage of remaining warm as
they had to rig the boats. All was
not lost, however, as the new
team colour jackets had arrived
the previous weekend, and so
the team was proud to boast
these to the opposition in their
true splendour of pink and blue.
The initial races wer hard
fought and close finales resulted,
as the advantage swing from
Sheffield to Imperial and back
many times. Andy Jones became
the savior to the team several
times by showing his deft team
racing skills of trapping the
opposition at the winning mark,
whilst Hunter Lowe showed
amazing agility on the stark time
combined with good upwind
speed. However, local
knowledge of the wind enabled
Sheffield to claim a narrow
victory over Imperial.
In the final race of the day, the
crews manoeuvered their way to
the back of the boats, whilst the
usual helms played the less
• dominant role at the front. At the
start, the team looked formidible
with Helen, Caroline and Jacob
(who led recently been promoted
to crew, and was now being given
the chance to display his true
talent) flying out not a second
early for the line, victory could
not be assumed too early in the
race, as Sherfield pointed out to
them by their excellent analysis
of windshifts, which put them
hard on Imperial's transoms
owing to their superior speed.
The second lap saw Sherfield pull
marginally ahead, which they
maintained until the finish. This
did however show impressive
talent by the IC Brews, with the
obvious handicap of having the
helms crewing them, by putting
up such an incredible fight
against such a strong team.
In all, an enjoyable weekend
was had by everyone.
