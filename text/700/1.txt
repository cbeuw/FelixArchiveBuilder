Bar Prices
to Rocket?
Prices in College bars could be set to rise by up to 1Op a pint, if
they continue to serve beers not approved by the student union
purchasing consortium, the Bars Working Party (BWP). The
BWP is also threatening to withdraw its discounts from Imperial
because the bars are not run by the Union.
The BWP negotiates special deals
with several major breweries on
behalf of most student unions.
Although the bars at Imperial are
College-run they presently
obtain the discount because of
Union involvement in the Bar
Committee, which is chaired by
the Deputy President. However,
non-student union run bars may
not qualify in the future.
A condition of membership of
the scheme is that only the
recommended suppliers with
which deals have been struck
should be used. At present the
bars stock Watneys, Courage,
Bass and Whitbread beers, of
which only the first two are BWP
approved. Due to increasing use
of other suppliers by a number of
student unions, including
Imperial, the volume of trade
under BWP deals has dropped. A
motion at a recent BWP meeting
called for strict enforcement of
the rules, and decided that unions
failing to restrict their purchases
to approved suppliers would be
thrown out of the consortium.
The main non-BWP beer at IC
is Wethereds, which is supplied
by Whitbread. It seems likely
that this and other non-BWP
beers will have to be dropped,
otherwise prices will have to rise
substantially.
In a further development in
student union purchasing the
National Union of Students
(NUS) is attempting to set up an
umbrella organisation, the
National Student Services
Organisation (NSSO), taking in
the BWP, the Student Union
Purchasing Consortium (SUPC),
the National Association of
Student Travel Offices
(NASTO), and other similar
organisations.
The proposed new constitu-
tion of this body would exclude
unions not affiliated to the NUS
unless they join in the first year of
its existance. Subsequently non-
affiliated union would not be
eligible to join and any union
disaffiliating would be thrown
out of NSSO. At present the
various independent consortia
have only tenuous links with
NUS, and NUS affiliation is not a
condition of membership.
The NUS has not been active in
the services field since the mid-
70s when NUS Travel collapsed
and Endsleigh Insurance was
sold off. The present ad hoc
system of consortia grew up after
NUS's withdrawl from trading
activities.
The present organisations are
being asked to wind-up their
affairs and pass their assets to
NSSO at their AGMs taking
place over Easter. The NSSO will
be set up at a special Student
Services conference, also over
Easter. It seems certain that the
change will go ahead, with the
conditions for membership of
NSSO being finally decided at its
forthcoming conference.
UGM Flan Fiasco!

unopposed were John Ingham (Rag Chairman), J Martin Taylor

Oxford Thrashed!
The IC University Challenge

in their first match against
Somerville College, Oxford. The
team of Simon Errington, Dick
Langstaff, Duncan Swan and
Tim Williams won by 485 point
to 217.
The Show's presenter Bamber
Gascoyne described the win as
one of the biggest ever in that
form of the competition. The
team played their second match
last night but the result was not
available at the time of going to
press. The result and the date of
the television showing of the IC
