strange, unexplored part of the
world.
The 'Barrel' is a meeting of
twelve universities from all over
the country. The competition
this year was to be hotly
contested at this, the climax of
the season.
Having been first to arrive and
last to leave at the reception
party on Friday night, the team
was all ready for an early start on
Saturday.
The racing started with a drift
around the course with
Edinburgh and Birmingham. By
lunchtime, however, the wind
had picked up to a demanding
Force 1. With both members of
the crew fully hiked out (one
each side) the race against Aston
(this years BUSA champions)
began. The Robson/Burrows
combination got a crackng start
closely followed by Bevan and
Jeffries. Lowe and Hill decided to
hang back to buff an Aston Boat
the wrong side of the start line.
After a few slick roll tacks and a
few lucky windshifts Lowe
rounded the windward mark in
second place with Bevan fourth.
The positions didn't change on
the downwind legs, so it was left
to the final boat to save the day.
Lowe covered the Aston boat
while Bevan attempted to get 100
tacks in on one boat. The tactics
worked and Lowe finished
second with Bevan third. Aston
left the race having sailed their
hardest match of the weekend.
The results of the 'Alternative
Barrel' were contested on
Saturday evening at the Shinla
cury Louse—a place of dubious
reputation. IC v Edinburgh was
to be the deciding race.
Edinburgh got off to an early
start and claimed first place.
Impressive chapati manipulation
was demonstated by Robson
who pumped home to finish
second. By this time some of the
Edinburgh team were calling for
'Water', but there was no overlap
and they were forced to take a
green.
IC came in third and fifth and
claimed the trophy, leaving,
Edinburgh shouting for a general
recall, but to no avail.
GOLF
On Wednesday 13 March
Imperial College Golfing Society
held their spring 36 hole
Stableford competition. The day
proved to be very enjoyable for
everyone who turned up. The
morning's session was won by
Dave Lang who manage 36
Points, narrowly beating David
Jakubovic (33 pts) and the
society's captain, Phil Hughes
Narborough (32 pts). In the
afternoon, everyone seemed to
be suffering from hearing about
Dave's 36 pts, and the overall
standard of play fell. However
Huw Jones did manage to secure
32 points and was subsequently
declared the afternoon's winner.
Special credit goes to Adam
Campbell, who although unable
to play in the morning, returned a
cornmena,ble 31 pts during this
latter session of play.
Finally, after the last shot had
been hit and the last putt sunk,
the majority of those who played
enjoyed an excellent meal in the
clubhouse. Special thanks go to
our guest at the dinner, last years
captain, Marin Ross.
One final item of news for all
the society's members is that the
club championship will be held
next term on Wednesday May 8.
HOCKEY
Flying
the flag
This season the 3rd XI have
flown the flag for the hockey
club. With new shirts at the
beginning of the season, we were
determined to prove that this
was a good investment. From the
start success came our way with
a good 6—4 win over OMT's.
After this initial victory we never .
looked backed and our final tally
of results reads: played 8, won 5,
drew 1 and lost 2 with 25 goals
scored and 17 conceded.
Throughout the season there
was good commitment from the
majority of players and a regular
core of about 8 players was
established. Thanks go to all
those who played for the thirds.
Notably performances were
achieved by our top scorers Per
Dullforce and Jonathan Sturgers
who both scored 4 goals each
and Vernon Morris who
achieved the unique distinction
of breaking his jaw and also
about 4 hockey sticks!
Other players who made
invaluable contributions include
John (Sgt Pepper) Spencer,
Dave Gott, Ian Mace, Richard
Ellis, Steve Brooker, Scott
Fraser and in goal Chris Jones.
RUGBY
Bottle
retained
On Sunday March the 10 the
Royal School of Mines Rugby
club retained the 'Bottle' in their
annual encounter with the
Camborne School of Mines.
The match, cancelled because
of snow in February, was
eventually started at Exeter in
perfect rugby conditions.
Moving at a frantic pace first
blood went to RSM as a penalty
was kicked by K Douglas. CSM
missed four reasonable first half
chances to turn round at half
time 3—0 down. However things
didn't stay that way for long as
their fly-half scored a good
dropped goal the ball going in off
a post. Worse was to follow as
the Camborne winger intercep-
ted an RSM backs movement
and raced away the length of the
field to score an unconverted try.
The match was still very close
and RSM pressure was rewarded
with another penalty which was
kicked to make the score 7—6.
In to the final ten minutes both.
teams missed kicks which were
crucial until K Douglas put over a
penalty from just inside the CSM
half to pull the game out of the
fire, RSM wining 9—7. The
match was extremely close but
fortunately the Bottle will stay in
London for another year.
Thanks must go to all supporters
who travelled to Exeter and the
Bottle match team and reserves.
What did you do this
weekend?
-and did you enjoy it?
London can be an exciting place to
live—but only if you know the ropes. In
October several hundred fresh faced first
years will arrive at Imperial College and you
can help them enjoy their first few weeks
here to the full.
A few weeks before the start of the academic year all first
year students receive a copy of the IC Union Handbook.
Can you pass on information to help them in their first
year? Whether you want to review a favourite
restaurant,pub or cinema,discuss the merits of the local
shops or write an article on study skills there is a place for
everything. If you are the Chairman/Captain of a club or
society you are also required to submit a short article
detailing your activities and facilities(see pidgeon holes
for details). General photographs of college and local
events are particularly useful.
If you are at all interested in passing on your knowledge
and advice please contact Nigel Atkinson via the Felix
office as soon as possible. The copy deadline will be
Friday 31st May.
