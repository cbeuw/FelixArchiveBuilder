Dr Chandra, creator of the computer, DrHey woodFloyd, leader
of the American team, and engineer Walter Cumow, designer of
the Discovery craft.
'My God, its full of stars!'. The
credits are as long as your
arm. Still, many hands make
light work; 2007 took five
y e a r s t o m a k e , 2010
considerably less, and in this
time, Peter Hyams, (screen-
writer, producer and director
for the film) has not only
provided a celluloid icon at
least comparable in size to its
predecessor, but has closely
tailored it to the wishes and
beliefs of A C Clarke himself,
even if they are not in
everyone's taste.
The plot is as comprehen-
sive as it is incredulous.
Russia and America join
forces to investigate the
remains of the Discovery, the
A m e r i c a n r e s e a r c h - c r a f t
deserted beyond Jupiter. As
the nature of the planet and its
moons (include the giant
b l a c k m o n o l i t h ) b e c o m e
clear, the two teams are
compelled to work together
openly, despite increasing
political tension at home. You
cannot be serious! Their
destinies are decided by the
ominous planet, which, as it
erupts to create a new
universe, sends them back to
MVIEWSD
a peaceful Earth, in a finale
reminiscent of some kind of
intergalactic Hair.
Hyam writes: 'If Arthur C
Clarke had not been totally
satisfied with my screen play, I
would not have made this
movie, the ideas, the notion,
the concept is his. All along
the way, I told him what I was
going to do. Frankly, I wanted
to know how he felt'. It is this
e x c l u s i v e o b s e s s i o n with
Clarke's original ideals that
threatens to turn this film into
a cult-work. Unlike Kubrick's
'2001' it lacks presentation,
and style. Special effects,
although enhanced by 70mm
work, are naive and unspect-
aclar and although where the
pace of the film rises the
suspense is sadly unsustain-
ed. There is some good acting
f r o m H e l e n M i r r e n a n d
v e t e r a n R o y S c h e i d e r
however, coupled with the
hunky return of Keir Dullea as
Dave Bowman.
Like 'Dune' however, the
Sci-Fi enthusiasts will sit
through this unperturbed.
Everyone else should take a
cushion.
From the first few lines you
can tell that this is not a film
that can be taken seriously.
Some Bumph like;
'In every sport there is one
that will rise above the rest
and not be equalled'.
All this film seems to have to
its credit is that it is true.
A n o t h e r over dramatised
story about an animal. I am
not moved by loud dramatic
music and a film of two horses
racing desperately for the line.
If you were in love with Black
Beauty, then watch this.
T h e f i l m f o l l o w s t h e
romantic story of the famous
Australian horse, 'Phar Lap'.
It's arrival in Australia fit only
for resale as meat and it's
tough training to victory and
stardom. It was obviously a
great horse but I would hardly
call him a legend. It would
appear however that the
w o r k i n g c l a s s o f t h e
d r e p r e s s e d 1 9 3 0 ' s o n l y
survived because their hero
w a s o u t o n t h e t r a c k
bankrupting the b o o k i e s .
Along side this the relation-
ship develops between the
horse and its stable boy,
T o m m y W o o d c o c k ( T o m
Burlinson), who later rises to
become a reknowned trainer.
The Film ends with the
horses mysterious death
sixteen days after his first
American, and most success-
ful race.
Phar Lap â€” the
heart of a nation
