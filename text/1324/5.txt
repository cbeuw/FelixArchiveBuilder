The Rector’s role
Sir,
I would like to express my appre-
ciation of last week’s article on your
interview with Sir Richard Sykes.
I’m sure there aren’t many of us who
wouldn’t jump at the chance to haul
our esteemed Rector over the coals
and grill him on our pet grievances,
so it was with great interest that I
turned to page 10 of Felix. On the
whole, I was not unpleasantly sur-
prised. The article managed to dis-
pel some of the mystery surrounding
the head of our College, and gave
some indication of what’s to come.
There are, however, some points
that bother me and that I’d like to
voice. First of all: the library situ-
ation. I cannot either corroborate
or dispute the famous librarian’s
claims. I can say, though, that I and
several of my fellow students feel
that the Rector has got wholly the
wrong idea. While we do enjoy the
luxury of being able to stay in the
library and work until the wee hours
of the morning, this is not a call to
close all the other libraries. Each
department has its own history and
sense of self – the departmental
libraries are one of the best ways
of safeguarding that. Sentimentality
aside, it is painfully obvious to any-
one using the library over this period
that its capacity is already stretched.
If Sir Richard’s plans for disposing
of all the other study areas were to
go ahead, the building would need
to double in size to accommodate
all the people and publications, or
face being woefully inadequate. The
idea of turning Waterstone’s into a
cafeteria is, in my view, ridiculous.
Waterstone’s provides a most con-
venient and affordable (as much
as academic books ever are) serv-
ice. Most of all, it caters specifi-
cally to the students’ needs, which
is invaluable and off-campus book-
shops could not come near filling the
gap. Unfortunately, Mr Sykes seems
to have already made up his mind
about a lot of this, and I expect much
of it to fall on deaf ears.
On top-up fees: I would like to
see the various university authori-
ties petitioning the government for
better funding to make higher edu-
cation more accessible. If Labour is
so committed to the 50% target and
promoting the UK’s academic stand-
ing, why aren’t lower university fees
part of that?
Last but not least, I wish to raise
the issue of the general opinion of
the Rector. There is the feeling that
a lot of what happens around the
College in terms of changes and
procedures is not only beyond the
control of the students (which, to
a certain extent, is to be expect-
ed), but that the students are not
properly consulted or even informed
of anything. How can he voice con-
cern about the student body (“we
want to encourage them, show that
we care about them”) when he him-
self is such an intangible figure, who
many feel takes little or no notice of
what the students want to say, and
what they want to happen?
Yours,
Alistair Finn
Aeronautics
Ardi Kolah, Imperial’s Director of
Communications, responds:
It’s always easy to criticise those
in authority and to some extent the
Rector is a soft target for any such
criticism that’s going. But Alistair’s
points are way off the mark.
A substantial part of the communi-
cations effort is focused on improv-
ing internal communications,
including communication with our
students. And Sir Richard’s right
behind this effort.
We’ve also ensured that students
are engaged in the heart of the
decision making process and the
president of ICU sits on Council.
This provides an effective voice for
students at the highest level in our
College and ensures that students
have a say in issues that materially
affect their quality of life.
Sir Richard makes every effort to
meet as many students as he can to
solicit their views and opinions.
Of course we could always do
more and I’d be interested to hear
from other readers of Felix where
we can improve our efforts in this
regard [a.kolah@ic.ac.uk, 020 7594
6699]. But to set the record straight,
Sir Richard has been instrumental
in driving through developments
in key facilities and services for
students.
These include the multi-million
pound re-development of new stu-
dent accommodation at Southside;
a £17.5m state-of-the-art Sports
Centre development which will be
free of charge for students wish-
ing to use its swimming and gym
facilities; 24-hour library opening to
cover revision requirements; more
cash machines around campus and
£20,000 fund for the Student’s Union
Summer Ball.
All of these developments have
come about through engaging with
students and listening to what
they would like to see happen at
Imperial. And Sir Richard should
be recognised for helping to drive
these changes through.

Dear readers,
In precisely one hour and twenty-
six minutes, Stormy Woods is going
to be enjoying a beverage with one of
Felix’s most esteemed columnists,
the lovely Mr Geraldes. Hopefully,
his presence in person will be as
charming as his presence on paper.
If this isn’t so, I’ll have much to
report, and so shall he – since this
meeting is undoubtedly tip top col-
umn fodder.
I’ve got very little else to report. I
handed my project in on Friday, and
have been partying non-stop since.
Very little in the way of deprav-
ity has happened – five pints of
Kronenbourg do not make Stormy
lower her standards to pizza-faced
linguistics students who speak poor-
er French than she does.
Pizza faces aside, there’s also been
a marriage proposal. No, not the ster-
eotypical Asian type involving two
sets of parents and a dowry – but a
spontaneous one from an IC Estates
worker on the Hammersmith cam-
pus. Flattering as it may seem after
a ten minute chat, gentlemen older
than my father are not quite what
I’m after. Night-carers are available
from social services, you know. And
functional packages are a necessity
to keep up with someone as passion-
ate as I am. Sex to me is like oxygen
to the rest of you...
Oxygen. Oxygene. I took a trip
down memory lane last night, whilst
sorting through my extensive CD col-
lection. Placebo, Mansun, Amen UK,
the Source, Mica Paris and D’Angelo
– I’d like to think I had taste as a
Shirley Manson-alike teenager. So
many moments captured in a song;
my first kiss to Kula Shaker’s Hush,
my first dance to Brown Sugar.
Classic. I wonder what my first fuck
will be to...?
First fuck? Stormy, the sex col-
umnist hasn’t actually had inter-
course yet?
You’ve got it. I’m a virgin. And a
perpetually horny one at that – the
only sex I’ve had is that involving a
pair of hands or a pair of lips. This
isn’t a religious choice by any means
– more a personal one. I’d like the
chap I give myself away to, to be
inspirational, passionate and under-
standing. I’d like him to respect me
for my talents, and connect with me
on an artistic level. Is this too much
to ask for?
PS Aaron S, I’m flattered to know
you read my column first – I aim
to make people remember me, for
better or for worse. Evil is essential
to make history what it is. I’d be
intrigued to hear your definition of a
slut. Does she actually need to have
sex, or just talk about it? What about
the promiscuous males you meet?

Internet sex tests
My inbox is constantly inundated
with emails from friends telling me
to take some sort of personal test or
other. You know the deal – you tick
the appropriate boxes and discover
things that you already knew about
yourself. They are generally rub-
bish and correlate really badly, with
one telling me I’m an extrovert and
another that I’m socially retarded.
I’d like to think that I know which
one I really am, but you never can
be certain.
An interesting part of this is wheth-
er one should be proud or ashamed
that the test labels you a nun or a
slag. Is it something to be proud of
that so far you’ve led a relatively
sheltered sex life? I don’t know. On
the other hand, should you be proud
that you’ve put it about quite as
much as you have? Admittedly, it
can be something to boast about (if
you’re a guy). But are the people
you’re telling really impressed by
your tally chart or are they just
pretending to be impressed because
that’s what society expects?
Recently, a new breed of test has
been created. This one lets you
set your own questions, and then
test how well your friends really
know you. I liked this new format,
as you can make yourself look much
more interesting than you really
are, and you get to set trick ques-
tions. You also discover that peo-
ple haven’t really been listening
when you’ve been talking to them.

I got an email from a mate the
other day telling me to take a sex
appeal test. It was cleverly worded
to the extent that even if you nor-
mally can’t really be arsed to take
such tests, you probably would.
So I started filling in the test. It
started off all nice and innocent
with name, age, etc. Then, “What
turns you on?” with some potentially
dodgy options such as golden show-
ers and S&M. Next come “How often
do you masturbate?” “How big is
your penis?” “How many one night
stands have you had?” “Ever had
bisexual feelings?” “Ever had sex
with someone of the same gender?”
I answered all the questions hon-
estly, then clicked the send but-
ton expecting it to tell me I have
a **% sex appeal. But no, a mes-
sage appears saying “you have been
fouled by ‘name of friend’, and all
your answers have been sent to
your friend’s email address”. Fuck.
Now, there wasn’t anything illegal or
depraved in my answers, but your
sex life is a private domain. I was
like, bugger, I don’t want my friends
to know everything about my sex
life. I worried for a bit, but then
thought to hell with it, it’s nothing
too serious, and your friends should
understand you better if they know
more about you, shouldn’t they?
Then I noticed in the small print
at the bottom it said “don’t you feel
violated? Why not foul your friends
too?” So that’s exactly what I did: I
forwarded the email to other friends.
I’m not sure why I did it, I didn’t real-
ly want to know about their sex lives
(I reckon I know most of it anyway).
I think I did it mainly as a way of
extracting some kind of revenge, but
it wasn’t these people I should have
been directing my revenge towards.
I got an email the next day from
one of the recipients. All it said was
“wanker”. Well, I guess I deserved
that. I spent the rest of the day try-
ing to warn the rest of my friends
from filling in the test.
The final twist is that you can’t
actually read the responses of the
people who filled it in... well, you can
but it costs you £1.50 a time!
Moral of the story: be wary of
internet sex tests.
