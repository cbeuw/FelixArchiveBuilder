The science fiction renaissance
With the success of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and Star Wars, and the return to prime time
TV of British series Doctor Who, Darius Nikbin asks why science fiction is making a comeback
In the 1950s, science fiction
was used as a propaganda
vehicle to promote ideas
about the ‘red scare’. Films
like The Thing from Another
World (1951), It came from
Outer Space (1953), Them!
(1954), and The War of the
Worlds (1953) were reflec-
tions of the media and politi-
cal hysteria surrounding the
apparent threat posed by
communism.
During the Cold War, main-
stream science fiction films
were perfect for represent-
ing the deepest fears of the
post-WWII generation. The
Communists took the form
of giant radioactive red ants
or alien space invaders,
embodying the terror that
Americans felt from an invis-
ible, unknowable enemy.
Today, it appears that sci-
ence fiction is undergoing
a bit of a comeback in the
mainstream. With movies
like The Hitchhiker’s Guide
to the Galaxy and Star Wars:
Revenge of the Sith making
megabucks on the big screen,
science fiction appears to
be a successful genre that
the industry will find hard to
ignore. Spielberg’s remake of
The War of the Worlds, arriv-
ing in July, looks set to be one
of the biggest hits.
So why are we seeing this
new wave of science fiction?
Sci-fi movies are all about
suspending the audience’s
disbelief. A science fiction
film with obviously fake spe-
cial effects quickly finds itself
relegated to the ‘B-movie’
category. Recent advanc-
es in Computer Generated
Imagery (CGI) have made it
cheaper to make convincing
alternate universes.
For instance, the main rea-
son for the return of Doctor
Who on the small screen is
that the BBC can now afford
CGI,sotheydon’thavetohave
plots hinging on actors dress-
ing up in rubber suits bought
from the local party shop and
pretending to be Zorgons
from Alpha Centauri.
The CGI revolution began
in 1975 when George Lucas
established a new company
Industrial Light and Magic,
which was to produce the
visual effects for his new
movie Star Wars (1977).
Lucas’ maxim was “sound
and music are 50% of the
entertainment in a movie”.
The success of the Star Wars
series has proved him right
ever since.
But a criticism that has
often been levelled at science
fiction is that usually the
characters are very poorly
developed and unrealistic.
This may be true – from
Blade Runner to Star Wars:
Revenge of the Sith, dialogue
and characterisation have
always been weak points with
sci-fi movies.
However, what science fic-
tion lacks in characterisation,
it makes up for in ideas. We
live in a world when advanc-
es in technology are begin-
ning to outpace our ability to
keep up with them. We live
in a technological culture.
Although recent films such
as I, Robot and Minority
Report are entertaining, they
also provide social commen-
tary about the nature of our
technological culture that
other genres of film are una-
ble to make. Another recent
example is Gattaca, in which
social issues about genetic
engineering are addressed.
In its ability to create virtu-
al universes, where the only
constant is human nature
and everything else is liable
to change due to technology,
science fiction provides a val-
uable cultural commentary
that other genres of film-
making are incapable of.
It is also the ultimate form
of cinematic escapism. The
movies portray worlds as
distant from the day-to-day
monotony of modern living as
we can possibly imagine.
But some sci-fi purists
remain sceptical: “Big budget
‘sci-fi’ films have always been
popular and tend to come in
waves,” says Michael Wright
of Imperial’s Science Fiction
society.
“I’m not sure science fiction
as a genre is getting more
popular. Many of the people
who will see Revenge of the
Sith in the cinema wouldn’t
touch a sci-fi book, and many
of the best sci-fi TV series
have been cancelled.”
What is undeniable, how-
ever, is that at a time when
the movie industry is under-
going a bit of a recession, sci-
ence fiction movies seem to
be the most bankable on the
Hollywood production line.
So don’t be surprised if the
first decade of the 21st centu-
ry continues to see a science
fiction renaissance.
“These movies portray
worlds as distant
from the day-to-day
monotony of modern
living as we can
possibly imagine”
Science fiction films like Revenge of the Sith and The Hitchhiker’s Guide have been
successful at a time when Hollywood is facing a box office crisis
