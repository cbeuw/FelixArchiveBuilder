‘Save our Southside’
campaign launched
Students’ groups led by the
Real Ale Society have begun
a ‘Save Our Southside’ cam-
paign, in response to news
that the popular Southside
Bar will not be replaced when
the building is demolished
this summer.
Over 1600 people, includ-
ing more than 1000 Imperial
College students, have signed
a petition in support of the
campaign for the bar to be
replaced.
The group believes that
there are several other viable
locations for a large College
bar, such as the Ante Room
(next to the Main Dining Hall)
or certain disused buildings
on Princes Gate.
Tobias Dalton, chair of the
Real Ale Society, told Felix:
“The lack of consultation with
the student body has angered
myself and many others.
Southside Bar is not only well
used, but is a valued and key
part of this university. I’m sure
they haven’t considered all
the effects of this – Southside
staff also deal with things like
the summer ball and all sorts
of other College events.”
Mr Dalton said that South
Kensington was already lack-
ing cheap student-oriented
venues and the Union bars
would become overcrowded
as a result of the closure.
Representatives from the
campaign will meet the Union
President next week to dis-
cuss their concerns.
Union to push through
plans for Graduate
Students Association
Despite Monday’s Council
meeting being called off due
to low attendance, Imperial
College Union still plans to
have a Deputy President
(Graduate Students) and
a new Graduate Students
Association in place for the
beginning of next term.
The constitutional changes
necessary for the introduc-
tion of the new roles should
have been passed by two
consecutive meetings of
the Council, but the Union
President will ask the College
to suspend that rule in order
to hold elections for Graduate
Student posts later this term.
This could lead to a bizarre
situation in which elections
are held for roles that do not
yet technically exist.
It is likely that various Union
committees will be restruc-
tured or disbanded later this
term, but plans to alter the
composition of the Council
and Executive will now not be
considered this year.
QPR move to Harlington
Queens Park Rangers FC
have reached an agreement
to move to the Harlington
sports ground, which is owned
by Imperial College.
The ground, where many
Imperial student teams train
and play matches, was pre-
viously used by Premiership
champions Chelsea, who
moved to a new facility at
Cobham in December.
Imperial College Union
said it was confident that the
change would have no nega-
tive effect on its sports clubs.
