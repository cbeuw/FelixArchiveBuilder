Medics drag Imperial over finish line
‘athletes’ on the eve of the
event, sapping many of their
true strength.
To cut a long story short,
Imperial won the University
of London Championship
with 595 points to UCL
’s 412,
and the Imperial medics took
the hospitals trophy, finishing
on 449 to GKT’s 206 points.
So it doesn’t take an Imperial
mathematics student to work
out that the ‘thoroughbred’
Imperial students only scored
146 points. This, added to the
fact that UCL had no medi-
cal school to back them up,
means Imperial should really
have been crushed.
One can only begin to won-
der why such a large college
couldn’t manage to raise a
few more athletes from its
depths. Some blamed the
location of the event – appar-
ently Battersea is too distant
from the South Kensington
library, where the major-
ity of our beloved univer-
sity seem to reside. Which
begs the question whether
faster times would have been
recorded had the winner won
a subscription to the New
Scientist along with all the
episodes of Robot Wars on
DVD (or whatever superior
home entertainment system
they may be developing in
their front room/lab).
In case you haven’t noticed
by now, there was definitely
a medic flavour to the day
and by pure coincidence the
events got underway under a
cloud of medical controversy.
Following the men’s 110m
hurdles, two final year medi-
cal students nearly came to
blows arguing, not over an
infringement on the track,
but instead over the nature
of treatment that ICSM star
Richard ‘Brad’ Hutchinson
required. Having witnessed
the event, in which Richard’s
legs passed fluidly over the
hurdles whilst two small but
vital constituents of his pant
content failed to do so, the
medics argued ferociously
over whether stitches were
required in Brad’s heavily
lacerated scrotum. They were
indeed, and the lives of Brad’s
future children were saved.
But fortunately the day
wasn’t all about athletic inad-
equacy;infactPippaCallegari
showed more invention in the
2000m steeplechase than an
Imperial student in a physics
lab. In front of the onlooking
chairman of British Athletics
(possibly), Pippa, as if from
nowhere, created the ‘drop
and wade’ technique in the
water jump section of the
event [see photo, below right]
Wehaveheardsincethatnews
of this technique has spread
like wildfire around the ath-
letics world, and already the
world famous Kenyan team
have introduced it into their
winter training schedules
for the coming season. Also
sneaking into this event were
two highly respected Union
Deputy Presidents, Messrs
Rorke and Walker. Thanks for
lending your support, but per-
haps a touch more training
wouldn’t go amiss...
Be that as it may, there
were actually some perform-
ances Imperial athletes can
be hugely proud of. Eoin O
Colgain did particularly well,
coming second in the 10,000m
with a time of 35 minutes and
32 seconds (apparently on
purpose because the medal
goes better with his beautiful
silver locks). David Xiong did
well to come second in the
5000m in a time of 17min 4sec,
Elsa Carneau came second in
the women’s high jump with
1.50m, and the boys 4x400m
runners won in a time of 3min
53sec.
Imperial Medicals heroes
included Lydia Egan (best
performance 9.37m in the
shot) and James Franklin
(best performance 35.32m
in the javelin) who both won
the heptathlon and decath-
lon competitions respectively.
Hamish Stutcliffe picked up
second places in the 100m and
200m and astonishingly won
the baton throwing competi-
tion with a distance of 12.45m.
Mark Willesdon starred in
the 400m, winning in 54.0sec.
Angharad Care clawed back
a big lead to win the women’s
2000m steeplechase in 8min
2sec, Lucy Perkins won the
women’s 10000m, and Claire
Khaghani was second in the
discus. Tom Amies and Pippa
Callegari both finished second
in the hammer, while Temi
Lampejo won both the triple
jump and the long jump.
We were lucky enough to
have UCL student Christine
Ohuruogu, a semi-finalist at
the Athens Olympics in the
400m, to present the athletes
with their medals. Enormous
thanks to everyone that
turned up to compete and to
support, and perhaps next
year we can get a better turn-
out to represent Imperial and
hold onto our trophy.
The winning Imperial Medics team sit triumphantly at the end of the day with their trophy – apparently 30 years older than the modern Olympic Games
