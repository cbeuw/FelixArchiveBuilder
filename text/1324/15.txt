Imperial athletes win again
...with a little help from their medic friends
University of London
Intercollegiate Track
and Field Championship
By Max Marsden
and Martin Bailey
For the eighth consecutive
year, Imperial College raised
the cup high above their heads
as winners of the University of
London Intercollegiate Track
and Field Championship.
Having battled in the fields
and across the track of
Battersea Park athletics sta-
dium, victory was sweet.
Mind you, had it not
been for a little help from
the medics, Imperial would
have limped off into the sun-
set empty-handed. I should
explain: alongside the
Universities Championship,
the Medical School Athletics
Championshipragesonsimul-
taneously. The shield awarded
to the winning medical school
dates back to 1865, pre-dating
the modern Olympics by just
over 30 years, and is a beauti-
ful trophy to lay claim to.
So Imperial Medics fight it
out in the Medical Schools
competition and thorough-
bred Imperial students go
into battle for the Universities
competition. Simple... well not
quite, as the medics’ points
also count in the universities
competition overall. Why?
well, because basically we’re
all from the same big happy
family at the end of the day,
and us medics just love help-
ing people.
So now you know what it’s
all about, we’ll start from the
beginning. As the sun rose on
Sunday morning, the Imperial
team was select (small), elite
(well, more so than the med-
ics) and well organised (again,
its all relative), but were out-
gunned and outnumbered by
teams from King’s, UCL and
Goldsmiths.
It looked grim for Imperial
and they knew it. The first
inklings of self-doubt spread
through the team like a mos-
quito in a nudist colony. The
Imperial Medics were not
much better – bigger defi-
nitely, but not better. All was
not prefect in the camp, as
it seemed a nasty endemic
of acute ethanol intoxica-
tion had swept though the
ATHLETICS
