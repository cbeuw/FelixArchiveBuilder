Six Degrees of Whoever
FUCWITs
There’s half a point for each
blank filled above, that’s 16 points
in total, and there’s another two
for each celebrity below, giving a
grand total of 30 lovely FUCWIT
points. Remember, there’s prizes.
Honestly.
In a throwback to last year’s ever popular ‘Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon’ game, Coffee Break brings you ‘Six Degrees of Whoever’.
It’s very simple, just fill in all the blanks, linking the actors and films together. There’s half a point for each blank filled.

Coffee Break is a great believer in role models. We’ve lived our lives in accordance with the teachings
of such luminaries as The Hoff, The T and Will Ferrell from Anchorman. But some people are so iconic,
they can be identified by their hair alone. Here’s some hair, tell us whose it is. Two points for each.
