1. Playful artist turning back on companion (4)
by Snufkin
Hello again! Those of you who found last week’s puzzle frustrating because
of its obscure answers will be pleased to know that this week’s is much more
down-to-earth. In my defence, it is quite hard to fill a grid whose perimeter
consists of two sets of four adjacent anagrams (retinal, reliant, latrine,
entrail; tearing, granite, gratine, ingrate). There are a couple of conceits
in the completed grid for this puzzle, too, but they are much less obtrusive
– and I think some of the clues are great fun. Good luck! Snufkin
