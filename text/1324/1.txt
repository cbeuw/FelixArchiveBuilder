College clothing controversy
Mr T joins physics greats
Eighties superstar Mr T joined an elite group of physicists last week, when his picture appeared in this display of Nobel Laureates in the Blackett
Laboratory. The prank seems to have succeeded in amusing students as they revised for exams, but the photograph has now been removed

Imperial College Union staff
have told Felix that they were
asked to stop selling cer-
tain items of clothing which
were seen as offensive to the
College brand.
The College’s Director of
Communications, Ardi Kolah,
and Director of Project
Management, Chris Towler,
visited the Union shop on the
Sherfield walkway last week.
“I understand that my staff
found them quite threatening
and intimidating,” said Union
President Mustafa Arif.
The staff felt that they had
been asked to take various
items – bearing the name
‘Imperial College London’
without using the new logo
– off the shelves.
Mr Arif continued: “It was
stock that was apparently
‘offensive to the brand’, in
particular the underwear
and the fun T-shirts, like the
Matrix spin-off and so on.”
The Union shop sells a
range of clothing featuring
the ‘Imperial College’ name,
such as T-shirts with the
slogans ‘ICUK London’ and
‘Probably the best college in
the world’, mimicking certain
famous brands.
Mr Kolah told Felix that
the College is trying to build
an international brand.
“We’re working together to
find a solution to this,” he
said. “There is policy on
how the brand ought to be
used, and there should have
been more importance
placed on following that to the
letter.”
Mr Arif argued that the
Union had followed the policy
and that many of the prod-
ucts in question had been
approved by the College fol-
lowing its rebranding exer-
cise two years ago.
He added: “I think the
College communications divi-
sion needs to fully understand
how university identities
work. Ultimately they are the
rights holder, but if they are
unhappy with some products
we are stocking, they should
negotiate that with us, rather
than just marching in saying
‘this is offensive to the brand,
I can’t believe you’re doing
this’. They need to recognise
that students are going to
want fun things.”
The Union shop could be forced to stop selling T-shirts like these, featuring the Imperial
College name in different styles to the official logos
