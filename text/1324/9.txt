At last, the movie we’ve all been
waiting for is here! It’s been what
seems like ages since Episodes I
and II hit the big screen, and finally
it’s time for Star Wars Episode III:
Revenge of the Sith. I must say it
was certainly worth the wait.
The third film takes place during
the height of the Clone Wars, and
begins with an amazing space bat-
tle as Obi Wan (Ewan McGregor)
and Anakin (Hayden Christensen)
lead an attempt to rescue the kid-
napped leader of the Galactic Senate
and secret Sith Lord, Chancellor
Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid).
Upon their arrival back on
Coruscant, Anakin greats his wife
Padme (Natalie Portman) and
learns he is to be a father. Having
to keep this secret, along with his
marriage to Padme, troubles Anakin
greatly.
Through the night, he is trou-
bled by dreams and visions of his
beloved wife dying during child-
birth. However, Anakin learns from
Chancellor Palpatine of a once great
Sith Lord, whose knowledge of the
dark side of the force was so great
that he could cheat death and stop
people from dying.
As the Jedi Knights are being dis-
patched across the galaxy to help
fight in the wars, Anakin is fur-
ther tempted by the prospect of the
knowledge of how to save Padme
from death, eventually learning
of Palpatine’s position as the Sith
Lord and pledging his allegiance to
him. He is now no longer is Anakin
Skywalker, but Darth Vader. So
begins his journey to the Dark Side.
First off, this movie is visually
stunning. There are a few original
treats that have never been seen
before, such as Obi Wan riding on
the back of a gigantic lizard, but on
the whole the special effects are
mostly typical of the other prequels.
However, the sheer quantity is far
greater and I guarantee you will not
be disappointed.
Revenge of the Sith is non-stop
action. The fight scenes are stun-
ning and amazingly choreographed.
Never have so many light sabres
clashed in any other Star Wars
movie. The last hour of the film
is really intense and will have you
glued to the screen as, towards the
end, the inevitable clash between
Obi Wan and his old apprentice
Anakin takes place. Truly gripping
stuff.
McGregor carries the film with
his terrific performance as Obi Wan
and does a wonderful job of creat-
ing the link between the younger
version of his character in the previ-
ous films and the much older Obi
Wan in the original trilogy (played
by Alec Guinness). Unfortunately
Christensen’s acting, yet again, is
below par, although marginally bet-
ter than his previous performance
in Attack of the Clones.
Despite Christensen’s hollow per-
formance, there is nothing else to
bring this film down. It’s exactly
as I was expecting the third movie
to be, which is good, since I had
high expectations. Revenge of the
Sith delivers excitement, action and
even a laugh or two.
I sense the force is strong with
this one. Enjoy this very much, you
will. Stephen Smith
All is forgiven George!

What begins as a weekend getaway
for six friends becomes a terrifying
fight for their lives in House of Wax,
an exciting re-imagining of the 1953
horror classic from Dark Castle
Entertainment and producers Joel
Silver and Robert Zemeckis.
A road trip to the biggest col-
lege football championship of the
year takes a turn for the worse
for Carly (Elisha Cuthbert), Paige
(Paris Hilton) and their friends
when they decide to camp out for
the night before heading to the
game. A confrontation with a mys-
terious trucker at the camp site
leaves everyone unsettled, and
Carly has her hands full trying to
keep the peace between her boy-
friend Wade (Jared Padalecki) and
her hot-headed brother Nick (Chad
Michael Murray).
They wake up the next morn-
ing to find that their car has been
deliberately tampered with. At
the risk of being stranded, they
accept a local’s invitation for a ride
into Ambrose, the only town for
miles. Once there, they are drawn
to Ambrose’s main attraction
– Trudy’s House of Wax, which is
filled with remarkably life-like wax
sculptures. But as they soon dis-
cover, there is a shocking reason
the exhibits look so real.
As the friends uncover the town’s
dark secrets, they are stalked by
a demented killer and find them-
selves in a bloody battle for surviv-
al. The group must find a way out
of Ambrose – or become permanent
additions to the House of Wax.
As part of the release of House of
Wax, Warner Bros have generously
