Wicked, wicked
Deep Jungle is massssif, says Harriet Wellington
Books books.felix@ic.ac.uk
Deep Jungle views itself as an
ambassador to exonerate the clichés
that bind us to age-old perceptions
of the jungle: what really happened
in jungle history, what’s really there
now and what state is it all in?
This illustrated volume accompa-
nies the ITV series of the same
name. The series’ investigative
technology is impressive, allowing
unseen footage and photography.
From flying remote-controlled cam-
eras to mice painted with fluorescent
powder, the production team has
carried out thorough and inspiring
research. Deep Jungle comprises a
very broad range of topics, however
it surprisingly only touches on the
jungle’s flora and fauna, on which
one might hope for more.
A history of the jungle evolves into
discussion of various controversies.
Pearce’s book addresses political,
mythological, tribal and ideologi-
cal issues central to jungle past,
present and future. However, if one
were to look for any Attenborough-
esque narrative of ‘how the leop-
ard got its spots’ type detail, Deep
Jungle would be lacking.
Touching on the idiosyncrasies of
random species, the book is a cap-
tivating splutter of factual descrip-
tion. From the plant perspective,
we hear about the discovery of the
regal aphrodisiac chocolatyl drink
using the vanilla bean and discovery
of the highly valuable nutmeg and
mace, at one point worth more than
their weight in gold. Then onto the
Brazil nut tree and why it grows
exclusively in Brazil and its indebt-
edness to the agouti guinea pig for
germination of its seeds.
Next Pearce sparsely touches on
the medical secrets held within the
rainforest pharmacy. We’re told of
the origin of HIV within monkeys
carrying AIDS, of the rosy periwin-
kle holding the secret to fight child-
hood leukemia, and of the Ebola
virus believed to have originated
from infected bush meat. The jun-
gle’s consumer arena follows,
where Pearce enlightens us about
the popular cuisine, souvenirs and
commodities yielded from its vast
expanse. Shockingly, a kilogram
of soft turtle shell from rainforest
swamps can fetch up only £1 sterling
for the local villagers in up-market
Asian restaurants. Equally surpris-
ingly, we’re introduced to the mar-
ket delicacies of Chinese bat faeces
and the fallopian tubes of frogs (only
while stocks last).
The book concludes by tossing up
various proposals: imagine trans-
port without the strange, milky
excrescence from a tree found deep
within the Amazon (we’re talking
rubber); imagine the 19th century
Imperial conquests without the bark
of an obscure shrub from the foot-
hills of the Andes (think tonic water).
Finally, Deep Jungle polemicises
about the destruction and devasta-
tion that logging, mining and pollu-
tion has caused in the rainforests.
To categorise Pearce’s adven-
ture would be an impossible task.
Spanning biology, evolutionary
theory, history and chemistry, Deep
Jungle is a compelling if sporadic
read.
