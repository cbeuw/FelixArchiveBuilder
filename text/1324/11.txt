FESTIVALS
It’s almost impossible to ignore the
fact that summer is the season for
the music festival. However, what
is often overlooked is that music
festivals are not all tents, mud and
huge speakers; some festivals are
somewhat more civilised and less
hazardous to one’s health. These
are, of course, those showcasing
classical music.
Summer is the season for the open
air performances and intriguing
destinations. Having said that, you
need not travel far to experience
the festival atmosphere – just take
a short walk to Holland Park, whose
opera festival is one of Kensington’s
better kept secrets. However, given
the recent improvement in quality
(there were some rather ‘interest-
ing’ productions on offer about eight
years ago) and the increased media
coverage this has engendered, it
will not remain a secret for much
longer.
Performances are held in the
park’s eponymous Holland House.
The House offers a ready-made
backdrop for productions that could
not be complained about; stately, but
at the same time unobtrusive.
Under the guidance of James
Clutton and Michael Volpe, Opera
Holland Park has been able to
move on from the rather below-par
quality that it was suffering, and
survive a rather abrupt change of
orchestras. The opera in Holland
Park is now definitely a place to
go to spot up-and-coming talent
and established names. And unlike
Glyndebourne and Bayreuth, you
don’t have to plan years in advance
and sell your soul to get tickets.
Just wander into Holland Park or
go to their website for ticket details:
www.operahollandpark.com.
This year’s season begins on June
7 and runs until the start of August.
The productions on offer are mostly
reasonably well-known operas sung
in their original language with surti-
tles provided, so no one need worry
about not understanding anything.
Given the venue is ‘open air’, there is
also the rather vital addition to any
British summer on hand – a canopy
to ensure that even when the heav-
ens open the show can go on and the
audience doesn’t begin to resemble
a collection of wet rats.
The season opens with
Verdi’s Macbeth and Bellini’s La
Sonnambula. However, if you want
tickets for either of those produc-
tions, I’d really recommend getting
a move on. I checked availability
last week and tickets were getting
scarce; not least because Hugh
Canning in the Sunday Times named
Macbeth as one of his top ten choic-
es for summer opera. The season
continues with Madama Butterfly,
L’Elisir d’Amore, Yevgeny Onegin
and concludes with Giordan’s
Andrea Chénier. Paola Smith
● For more information on opera
festivals around the world, the best
place to start is Opera: Festivals
2005, a magazine. This covers festi-
vals in all locations and provides all
of the necessary contact informa-
tion you could dream of. It’s a little
hard to come by, but the shop at the
Royal Opera House carries it, as will
any record stores with a decent clas-
sical music section. Otherwise, the
magazine’s website is www.opera.

Classical, cutting edge, primal
Revelations with the Royal Ballet
DANCE
I am more of an opera person than
a ballet person, so it was with some
trepidation that I booked tickets
for one of the Royal Ballet’s mixed
programmes. It was with yet more
trepidation that I headed off to the
performance last week, but that was
for rather different reasons involv-
ing a morning exam the following
day. However, what is done is done.
I was originally tempted to get
the tickets by the promise of being
able to see Stravinsky’s The Rite
of Spring, having read about the
Ballets Russes last summer, but
was very pleasantly surprised by
the rest of the programme. Mixed
bills commonly involve three short-
er productions all staged on the
same night, separated by intervals.
This particular group consisted of
The Dream, set to Mendelssohn’s
music for A Midsummer Night’s
Dream, The Rite of Spring and a
new work entitled Three Songs –
Two Voices set to music written by
Jimi Hendrix.
After the more traditional fare of
The Dream, Three Songs – Two
Voices was definitely something
completely different and entirely in
a class of its own; simply put, it
was stupendous. The evening was
rounded off with The Rite, not with
the original Diaghilev choreography,
but with the 60s MacMillan choreog-
raphy, which, while not the classic
version, still managed to portray the
very primal nature of the ballet that
was so shocking to audiences when
it was premiered in 1923.
I have never been in an audi-
ence that was quite so enthusias-
tic in its support, particularly for
Edward Watson who danced the role
of Oberon in The Dream. To be hon-
est, I enjoyed his performance, but
he didn’t really earn such raptur-
ous applause – his Titania, Leanne
Benjamin, far outshone him as he
wobbled his way through their duet.
That is my humble opinion, but it
must be pointed out that Watson’s
most enthusiastic fans did leave
after The Dream and so were per-
haps just there to see him and might
have been a little bit biased.
Three Songs – Two Voices refers
to the music being an arrangement
of three of Hendrix’s songs, Third
Stone from the Sun, Little Wing
and Fire, each portrayed, princi-
pally, by a pair of dancers. The musi-
cal arrangement was full of vigour
and the choreography more than
matched it. The only unfortunate
thing about this ballet was the sub-
stitution of the violin at times for the
guitar; violins can reach notes that
only dogs should be able to hear and
they do so with one of the most pain-
inducing tones.
This ballet truly demonstrated the
power of dance in interpreting music
and also served to show that dance,
in the form of ballet, is a hugely
versatile and modern medium that
requires real athleticism.
Given the rapturous receipt of
Three Songs – Two Voices from both
audiences and critics, it can only
be a matter of very little time until
it is back on stage. I do urge any-
one remotely interested and curious
about dance to sit through whatever
it is scheduled alongside and experi-
ence it – it is quite possibly the most
powerful piece of dance I’ve ever
seen. Sylvia was a spectacle not to
be missed, but this is beyond any
more words I have at my disposal.

People in different countries do
things differently. This is rather
obvious; but it never ceases to sur-
prise me just how vast the variation
is sometimes. Stand at Waterloo sta-
tion for 20 minutes and no-one will
bother you. You may get jostled a
bit, but nothing more. Get off the
Eurostar in Paris and, unless you
manage to make a quick getaway,
you will soon find yourself bombard-
ed with questions and comments
from streams of people you don’t
know. However, this isn’t really my
point at the moment – the plan was
to say a few words on Paris and the
arts.
This brings me on to buskers.
More often than not, the last people
you want to have in your carriage
on the train are buskers, however,
I was pleasantly surprised by the
quality of some Parisian busking.
A trio of performers boarded my
carriage and proceeded to make me
forget all about having missed my
intended train. These guys meant
business, which was patently obvi-
ous not only from the quality of ‘the
show’ but also from the very fact
that one of them was lugging round
a double bass – much more impres-
sive than the occasional guy with
guitar and harmonica extras that
we get here.
Moving away from the buskers,
I have decided to make a couple
of recommendations on some
sights you may miss when in Paris.
Firstly, Sainte Chapelle: after
four failed attempts to get in to
see this, I was richly rewarded by
a spectacular sight. The chapel
was built by Louis IX to house his
collection of relics. The most
stunning feature is definitely the
impressive array of stained glass
windows, most of which still boast
their original glass. This is Gothic
architecture and decoration at its
pinnacle.
The other place of interest I’d
like to point out is the National
Museum of the Middle Ages. This
houses the tapestries that are the
subject of the last Tracy Chevalier
novel as well as an impressive array
of medieval art and artefacts. The
museum’s buildings are also worth
seeing from both historical and
artistic viewpoints.
