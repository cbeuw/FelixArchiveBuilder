Japan
Just the home of Shinto, Sumo and Karaoke? Read how the modern Japan
lives, below
Until 1854, Japan had enjoyed a
wonderful time in isolation from the
rest of the world. It was a very
traditional country, with a strong
fear of foreigners. Based on the
feudal system of ancient Japan, the
Japanese were brought up to respect
and have the sense of loyalty to their
'Lord'. At the same time it was
necessary to have honour among
their peers.
The colourful part of Japan has
given rise to unique art forms
ranging from the famous tea
ceremony to exquisite flower
arranging. This was separated by
some bloody civil wars which have
led to the highly disciplined and
extremely sophisticated martial arts.
Each of these form are very
complex, requiring spiritual
'karma', meditation and many
highly ritualised techniques. The
Japanese have a number of
untranslatable words which
describe their concept of beauty.
One example is the word 'sabi'
which literally means loneliness,
and conveys a pleasurable sense of
the old, the faded, and the slightly
melancholy.
Shinto, Japan's ancient
indigenous religion, is a form of
nature worship. It was at first
nameless but came to be called
'Shinto' to distinguish it from
Buddhism. The name is of Chinese
origin, and means the 'Way of the
Gods'. Shinto has many deities
known as kami. According to
Shinto belief, the emperor is divine.
The gods are rarely represented in
human form. They are symbolised
in the shrines by objects such as
mirrors or swords. Shinto offers no
philosophical system or moral code,
but places great emphasis on
fertility and ritual purity.
Buddhism was introduced to
Japan from China in 552 A . D . By
the seventh century several sects
were established; and by the ninth,
Buddhism had greatly influenced
Japanese culture. It adopted many
native gods and beliefs from Shinto.
The two which are strongest today,
Jodo (Pure Land) and Shinshi (True
Sect) were founded in the twelfth
century. Zen Buddhism, also from
the twelfth century, took root
among the 'samurai'. It emphasises
self discipline. Zen means
'meditation' but Zen philosophy is
not opposed to action. Typical Zen
art forms are the raked garden of
, carefully chosen rocks in a sea of
raked white sand, and the
impressionistic landscape painting
perfected by the fifteenth century
artist, Sesshu.
The Japanese on the whole have
been aggressive towards foreigners.
This can be seen through early
modern history and its remnants can
still be seen today. This was
brought about by the fear of foreign
interference. The realisation that
Japan was an insignificant player in
the world caused huge social and
industrial changes. Japan has been
eager to adopt new ideas and
reluctant to do away with traditional
values. This can be seen by the
initial Japanese military expansion
and after the defeat in the second
world war, a huge increase in
economic activity.
The modern Japanese have a
similar attitude to that of traditional
Japan but modified for the new era.
The 'Lord' has been replaced by the
'Company'. Like before, self
esteem didn't matter on what your
job was but who you worked for.
Although Japan has very few
natural resources, it has flourished
industrially by concentrating on
improving on previous industrial
and technological advances. Her
products range from the modern
micro stereo system to super
tankers.
The Japanese have a very strong
family bond. They have a fairly
extended family where the elders
are respected and looked after by
the younger members. Individual
privacy is not highly valued and
children are brought up in an
atmosphere of intimacy. This is
enhanced by the fact that many live
in very small flats, which in a
