New Restaurant Special
Good morning, crap lecture, ain't
it? If you missed breakfast this
morning then don't read on because
this is Felix's answer to the Beebs
Good Food Guide....it's the Good
Food Column. Every week, we -
Vic & Nainish - will be reviewing
restaurants at which you can enjoy
yourselves and have a good meal.
The examination will be from a
student point of view, with the
conclusive, all important 10 scale.
So, to start it all off, we have the
local Luigi Malone's, and the rather
centrally located Chicago Rib Shack
II.
Luigi M a l o n e ' s
Next to Europa on Old Brompton
is "Luigi Malone's". To get to the
seating area, you have to pass
through the bar, and it is at this
point you realise that this place is
small. Don't let this scare you away
though, the atmosphere is superb -
'friendly and cosy'.
Onto the meal though. The menu
is wide-ranging, as is common these
days, with a choice to placate any
palate. You don't need a starter, but
if you insist on one the garlic bread
(£1.50) is the cheapest, and the brie
with wild cherries (£2.95) is
imaginative.
The main meal is HUGE. A pizza
(£4.65 - £5.95) is enough for two,
and very few people ever get round
to finishing the whole course. There
are various types of burgers (£4.95
- £5.25), but be warned they come
rare, tell them if you want it
different. There are salads of all
kinds. There are the mandatory
pasta dishes. Club sandwiches for
the aspiring yuppies and of course
steaks - even a 16oz one for those
with a humongous appetite! They
have not forgotten about
vegetarians, here again the variety
of choices is good.
If there is still some space left in
your tummy, the deserts follow the
trend set from before. They are
large and good. Vic could have
swum in his Hot Fudge Sundae
(£2.45), and Nainish's Tiramisu
(£2.45) was gorgeous.
The waiters will bring cocktails
(£2.95) - in Happy Hour (£2.25) -
to your table, and these are rather
large too. All the other soft drinks
are available, but the cocktails are
mixed well, even if there is not such
a large choice.
The major drawback though was
that Luigi Malone's was way too
cramped for our liking. Vic found
a severe lack of elbow room, and
there is no where to stretch your
legs. It was quite dimly lit, giving
a romantic feel to the place, but the
atmosphere smacked of anything
but.
Luigi Malone's has specials at
lunch with every main course
served with a free drink (of any
kind), so pricing it just above the
Main Dining Hall, but with more
variety.
All-in-all Luigi Malone's proves
that size is not everything - it might
be small but you get big portions.
On the 10 scale Vic gives it a 7, and
Nainish says 7.

C h i c a g o Rib S h a c k II
The 'Chicago Rib Shack II' is set
on two levels, with the bar on the
ground floor, and the food in the
basement. The bar is one of the best
we have come across, with the
cocktails large and very well mixed.
There is a menu of 16 titles, but ask
for your fave, they'll know it. Try
to go during Happy Hour (5-11pm),
when cocktails are half price
(£2.45).
The Meal. Not a vegetarians
delight, but Ribs are their speciality.
The Ribs form the main choice
from the menu, but there is also
chili, grilled steak, and Fajita's. We
recommend the combination meal
(£9.95), giving you choice and a
full stomach. There is a wide range
of side dishes, the onion loaf
(£2.95) is truly huge and the corn-
on-the-cob (£1.95) is the best we've
tasted.
Desserts are great (£2.25 - £3.75),
you'll not believe the banana split,
and Vic doesn't believe even
chocaholics will be able to finish off
the mud pie.
Decorations are a good talking
point during the meal, with large
Flintstone characters staring at you
from all around, but unfortunately
the music is rather plain. The
service is good, with the waiters
even offering to put your bib on for
you. Service is quick with our meal
arriving in 15 minutes during a busy
spell.
We say a place to visit if you're
in Leicester Square and have £15
doing nothing. On the scale Nainish
awards 6, and Vic 6.
