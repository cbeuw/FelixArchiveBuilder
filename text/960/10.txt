Iran covers 636,300 square miles
(1,648,000 square kilometeis) in
southwestern Asia. It is bounded on
the north by the republics of
Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Turkmenistan, and the Caspian Sea,
on the south by the Persian Gulf and
the Gulf of Oman, on the east by
Pakistan and Afghanistan, and on
the west by Turkey and Iraq. Iran
also controls about a dozen islands
in the Persian Gulf. More than 30%
of its 4,770 mile boundary is
seacoast. The capital is Tehran. The
currency is Rial. Among Middle
Eastern countries, Iran is unique in
many ways. Its official language,
Farsi (Persian), is Indo-European.
While Iran adopted a modified
version of the Arabic alphabet, it
did not lose its separate identity
after the establishment of the Arab
Empire in the 7th century.
Iran is the only country in the
Middle East that uses the Islamic
solar calendar, which originated
before the beginning of the Persian
Empire (550 BC). The Arabic lunar
calendar is used for religious
observances. After the conversion
of the vast majority of Iranians to
Islam, the ancient Iranian calendar
was adjusted to begin with the year
of the Prophet Mohammad's
immigration to Medina (the hijrah),
equivalent to A D 622. The Iranian
year begins on 21 March (beginning
of spring) and all the twelve months
coincide exactly with the zodiac
months.
Iran's complex climate ranges
from subtropical to subpolar.
Altitude, latitude, maritime
influences, seasonal winds, and
proximity to mountain ranges or
deserts play a significant role in the
fluctuation of temperature, which
varies from a high of 55 °C in
Khuzestan Province at the head of
the Persian Gulf to a low of -35 °C
in Azarbaijan Province in the
northwest. Rain fall also varies
widely, from less than two inches
in the southeast to about 78 inches
in the Caspian region.
Iran is a multilingual and diverse
cultural society. Nearly half of the
people speak Farsi, and the other
half speak various Indo-European
languages or dialects. Other
languages spoken in Iran include
Kurdish, Luri, Baluchi, a variety of
Turkic languages, Armenian, and
Arabic. Persian literature and
especially the poetry have
influenced a lot of poets, writers
and philosophers in the rest of the
world. Among the great names in
Persian literature are those of
Firdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Sa'adi,
Hafiz, and Mowlana.
The vast majority of Iranians are
Muslims, mostly of the Shi'ite
branch, which is the official state
religion. Kurds and Turkmen are
Sunnite Muslims, and among Iran's
Arabs the Sunnites and other sects
are represented. Major religious
minorities are Christians, Jews, and
Zoroastrians. -Christians comprise
the largest minority group, of whom
Orthodox Armenians constitute the
bulk. The Zoroastrains are largely
concentrated in Yazd in central
Iran, Kerman to the southeast, and
Tehran.
Traditions have remained strong
in Iran throughout its long history.
Despite war, strife, floods and
earthquakes, the character of these
traditions has persisted, surviving
often in a hidden form only to be
re-discovered and explored by later
generations. There are several
festive occasions that Iranians
celebrate. Some of these festivals
stem from the ancient times and the
others have religious origins. The
most important of the ancient
celebrations is Noruz, the Persian
New Year, which begins on the last
Wednesday of the old year with a
festival of lights and fire
(Charshanbeh Soori), followed by
a week-long holiday, and continues
until the 13th day of the new year,
which is a day for picnicking in the
countryside (Sizdahbedar). Other
important ancient celebrations
include the festival of harvest
(Mehrgan) at the beginning of
autumn and the longest night of the
year, 21 December (Yalda).
Amongst the religious festivals the
birthdays of the Prophet
Mohammad and the Twelfth Imam
of the Shi'ites, Mahdi are two of the
most prominent ones. On the
Twelfth Imam's birthday, cities
throughout Iran sparkle with lights,
and the bazaars are decorated and
team with shoppers. Other religious
festivals of great importance are the
day of the Prophet Mohammad's
appointment as the last prophet of
God (Mabaath), the first day after
the holy month of Ramadan (Eid-
e-Fitr), and the day of celebrating
the completion of the annual
Muslims' pilgrimage to Mecca
(Eid-e-Ghorban).
Iran's most important natural
resources are oil and natural gas.
Production and exploration are
concentrated in the southwest of the
country, but oil has also been
discovered in north-central region,
as well as under the offshore waters
of the Persian Gulf. Apart from oil,
carpet weaving, a traditional Iranian
industry, remains important and the
Persian carpet is one of Iran's most
significant exports. Carpet looms
are seen in most rural areas of the
country. Each locality prides itself
on a special design and quality of
carpet that bears its name, such as
Esfahan, Kashan, Kerman, Shiraz,
Tabriz, Nain and Qum. Other
important exports of Iran known
worldwide are Iranian caviar,
pistachio nuts, saffron and
