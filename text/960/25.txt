Opera
Falstaff
This was written as a farce, and the
company plays it as such: a lovely
piece of comic opera, Verdi's only
successful comedy, which had this
audience roaring with laughter.
Inventively costumed, and with
beautiful sets, this production is a
delight to watch (and to hear!). The
general quality of singing was
excellent, but particularly worthy of
mention were Falstaff (sung by
Jonathan Vera) and Alice Ford
(sung by Margaret Preece) who
both held the audience whenever
they were on stage. The libretto
states, 'Life should end in a burst
of laughter,'; this show certainly
did!

T h e M a r r i a g e of Figaro
Music Theatre London's latest
triumph is Mozart's frenetic
masterpiece The Marriage of
Concert
Festival of Britten
The London Symphony Orchestra's
association with Mstislav
Rostropovich has already brought
successful celebrations of
Shostakovich and Prokofiev to the
Barbican, and the Opening
Concert last week of the Festival
of Britten saw the start of a month
of concerts featuring the music of
the third composer with whom the
great Russian musician enjoyed a
close professional and personal
relationship. One of the highlights
of the series is the chance to hear
Rostropovich as the soloist in the
darkly magnificent Cello
Symphony, which Britten dedicated
to him, but he is appearing mainly
as a conductor, and it was in this
role that he began the Festival with
a programme, which once one had
accepted the fact that it didn't
contain any original Britten, was
both logical and daring.
Colin Matthews was musical
assistant to Britten during the
latter's final years, and the
gamelan-like writing for gongs and
bells in his new piece Memorial is
a reminder that Balinese music also
inspired Britten, although the work
is not a conscious tribute. After a
first hearing though, I wished
Figaro. Overflowing with oomph
and espalgene, this vigorous
production is busting with hilarity
and heavenly music.
Cherubino (Jill Washington) an
alluring adolescent; heady with
hormones, fancies everything; Sir
Cecil (Gerard Casey) a lean, mean,
smarm machine fancies everything
except his wife. Meanwhile Figaro,
valet and full-time wag along with
his fiance Suzanna (Liza Sadovy),
ladies maid, wagette, manipulate
the mahem and try to get married.
MTL's policy of employing actors-
who-can-sing rather than singers-
who-can't-act-but-it-doesn't-matter
is an unmittigated hit. Brilliant
acting enhances a pure Feydeau plot
whilst the clear, pleasant singing (of
Tony Britten and Nick Broadhurst's
pacey translation) does adequate
justice to Mozart's sparkling score.
This is what updated new-look
opera should be like, well
translated, well acted and well sung.
A perfect introduction or an
excellent new insight.

Matthews had used his forces more
sparingly, as the arresting and
memorable ideas of the orxning are
eventually submerged by percussion
and heavy, thickly-textured brass.
Shostakovich both influenced and
admired Britten, and the
Fourteenth, his grimmest and most
austere symphony, has clear
precedents among Britten's song-
cycles, a fact Shostakovich
acknowledged by dedicating the
work to Britten. A setting for
soprano, brass, strings and
percussion of poems by various
authors, the unifying theme of the
texts is death, and the tone is
predominantly one of tragedy and
despair. Rostropovich drew playing
of passionate corrrmitment from the
LSO strings, making the most of the
music's emotional extremes, such
as the numb, keening violin line of
the first Lorca setting, and the
grotesque gypsy fiddling of the
second. Soprano Elena Prokina
captures the radianace at the end of
'Loreley', the regret and bitterness
of 'The Suicide', and the anguish
of 'On the Alert'. The powerful
dark-voiced bass Mikhail Krutikov
was equally penetrating; even in
'Delvig', the work's one glimmer
of hope, any sense of comfort
seemed coloured by the
remembrance of previous suffering.
There is no consolation at the end
of this symphony, nor was there any
in the original Japanese Noh play
on which Britten based his church

opera Curlew River, the story of
a woman, mad with grief, searching
for her abducted son. The opera's
final scene, added by librettist
William Plomer, in which the boy's
spirit appears in order to reassure
his mother, formed a truly moving
climax to the superbly played and
sung production given by the
Guildhall School of Music and
Drama. Outstanding were Gwyn
Hughes Jones as the Ferryman,
Mark Milhofer as the Madwoman,
and the horn playing of Nicholas
Korth.
Shostakovich featured again on
Sunday afternoon, when the
Borodin String Quartet played
some of his earlier works along with
Britten's first two quartets. The
highlight of the programme was the
mature Second String Quartet, and
in particular a memorable account
of the eerie scherzo.
That evening, the first all-Britten
programme of the Festival found
the L S O and Rostropovich at the
peak of their form. Well-pointed
rhythms and dynamic contrast
characterised the Simple
Symphony, and if in the Piano
Concerto Barry Douglas had to
struggle to give cohesion to a piano
part which veers from Prokofiev to
Rachmaninov via Falla's Gardens
of Spain, the orchestra relished
Britten's eclectic writing, with
beautiful clarinet playing in the
Mahlerian 'Waltz' and rich lower
strings in the big-tune 'Impromptu'.
After a glorious account of Les
Illuminations from soprano Lynda
Russell, the slightly ponderus start
of the 'Lachrymosa' threatened to
make an anticlimax of the Sinfonia
da Requiem, but doubts were
dispelled by the snarling, mocking
brass of the 'Dies irae' and the
radiance of the final 'Requiem
aeternam'.
As an encore, the orchestra tore
into the 'Storm' interlude from
Peter Grimes, the opera which
catapulted Britten to international
fame in 1945. Grimes has been
well-served in London in recent
years, but in the absence of a revival
of Tim Albery's excellent 1991
production for E N O , the two
concert performances on the 14th
and 17th of March provide a
welcome opportunity to hear one of
the greatest masterpieces of 20th
century opera. Further attractions
are the Violin Concerto and the
Serenade for Tenor, Horn and
Strings this Sunday, the Cello
Symphony on the 18th, and
crowning the Festival, a
performance in the Albert Hall on
the 21st of the War Requiem, a
cataclysmic treatment of the
Requiem Mass interspersed with
intimate settings of Wilfred Owen's
war poetry.
