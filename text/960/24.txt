Murder is Easy.
M u r d e r Is Easy
Charlotte Attenborough, daughter
of Dickie Attenborough (luvvies,
sweeties, darlings, angels etc etc),
takes the role of a smart ass female
counterpart to the amateur
detective, played by Peter Capaldi,
in the stage premiere of Agatha
Christie's Murder Is Easy. She
R E A L L Y can act, along with Peter
and the rest of the cast. The only
imperfection that let the side down
was with the voice of Nigel
Davenport, who sounded like a
northerner with a throat infection,
doing a bad ' M i l k y - M i l k y '
impression.
A n n a K a r e n i n a
If you ever managed to read the
book, then go to this performance
and indulge. If you haven't read it,
then see the play instead - and
indulge as well. This theatre
adaptation of Anna Karenina is very
special and in many ways more
comprehensive than the usual,
concentrating on the inner life and
development -rather than just an
oudine of the plot- not only of Anna
herself but also Lewin who is
commonly ignored in other
adaptations. Although Anna and
Lewin only meet once, quite to the
end, they communicate with each
other through the whole play telling
each other what they experience.
The whole production succeeds
with only a few props and a very
simple scenery. The acting has a
strong expressionalistic influence,
The story was nothing short of
fantastically amazing, although I did
guess whodunnit about half an hour
from the end. But as usual, Aggie
makes you change your mind about
whodunnit every time the scene
changes, and the sets for each scene
are amazingly fantastic.
More atmospheric than the film
(so I'm told) and with an edge of
seat finale, this has to be a must for
lovers of murder/mysteries.

going far beyond pure naturalism
and enabling a deep insight into the
interactions of the characters. Kitty
and especially Seriozha (both
Jessica Lloyd) were expressed with
the help of mime. Anna (Teresa
Banham), Lewin (Richard Hope),
and Karenin (David Fielder) all
performed extremely well.
However, also the rest of the cast
acts not badly but for the widow of
the railwayman who was too
histrionic. The Shared Experience
Theatre Company presented a
exceedingly well set up
performance which is very much
worth seeing.

T u r a n d o t
Set in ancient China Princess
Torandot is a bitter passionless
woman since an ancestor was
ravished and killed by an invader,
and has sworn that no man shall
possess her. Unfortunately the
emperor is just about to snuff it and
wants her to rule with a husband.
Despite this she has many suitors,
whose only chance is to answer
correcdy three riddles but if they get
one wrong they get their heads
chopped off.
The exiled Prince Calaf turns up
and guess what? He falls madly in
love with her. Everyone including
his Dad's slave girl (who is secretly
in love with Calaf, herself) tries to
dissuade him but in the end he
correctly answers the riddles but
being a gambling addict gives her
another chance to chop his head off.
If she can find out his name by
dawn he's lost. Being a bloodthirsty
old cow she won't let anyone sleep
until she discovers it (Nessun
Dorma). She even tries torturing
him but she tops herself rather than
tell (but...young love). Then Calaf
gives Turandot a good snog and
whispers his name to her. After all
this (and reading her Cosmo) her
heart melts and at dawn she tells
everyone his name is love.
If you can afford it see it for if
nothing else the sets, costumes and
Chinese dancing. Vladimir Popov
(Calaf) is excellent and perfecfly in
phase with the orchestra. Gwyneth
Jones (Turandot) is just occasionally
a bit rough through the loud bits but
not bad overall. My favourite is Ciu
(Angela Gheorhiu), though. The bit
where she refuses to surrender to
Torandot's torture because of her
love for Calaf is extremely moving
and sensitively portrayed.
If you've never tried opera before
I'd recommend this one although by
the time this review is published
there'll only be a few more
performances left—6, 9, 11, 13
March.

C o s i Fan Tutti
Cosi Fan Tutti is often one of the
reasons why people don't like
Mozart. Commissioned by the
Vienna Court Opera, rather than a
drunken group of his mates, it was
written for the sort of audience who
sit in the theatre, drinking tea and
remarking to one another that the
music is 'terribly witty'. Those in
the know often speak of its beautiful
simplicity and amusing passages,
but frankly, it's the musical
equivalent of a Bath Oliver biscuit.
True, it does trundle along in a
fairly amiable manner, but not one
that anyone could find exciting as
even, perish the thought,
interesting.
However, opera consists of two
elements; music and story, and this
is where Cosi Fan Tutti pulls its
socks up. Two sisters Dorabella and
Fiordiligi (played by Julie Unwin
and Catherine Pierard) and dragged
into a wager of loyalty by their
lovers Fernando and Guglielmo
(Andrew Burden and Merring
Davies) with, as they say in the sit-
coms, 'hilarious consequences'. Of
course, this sort of sexual duplicity
stopped in about 1807, but with its
garish colours, energetic
performance and very funny
translation by Jeremy Sams this
production really does make an
enjoyable few hours. The English
Touring Opera (formerly Opera 80)
endeared themselves to thousands
of schoolchildren by holding opera
workshops at schools all over the
country—presumably with titles
such as 'Opera for the Kids','Well
Wicked Mozart' and 'Woofunky
Opera'. Don't hold it against them.
