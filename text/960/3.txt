Cut oft
Having had my space seriously cut
by an overenthusiastic PJ Dodd, I
am extremely short of room this
week. As you dry the tears from
your eyes at missing the favourite
part of you Friday's Felix, I will
leave you with only one thought:
This Monday and Tuesday you have
a chance to shape the way your
Students' Union is run for the next
year. Use it. By now most of the
campaigning will have been done,
but if you do see any candidates
around try to get them to discuss
their policies. Most importantly of
all USE YOUR VOTE!
Expect an Election Special Felix
on Wednesday Morning, revealing
all. Until then, hold your breath
with anticipation for the results.
OSC Issue
Many thanks must go to Yen Yang
and die Overseas student committee
Felix 960
for their help and assistance in
producing this week's issue. I hope
tonight's International Night is a
success and if you haven't already
brought a ticket I would urge you
to go.

After being Broadsheet editor for a
year, Max feels that he is qualified
to move to the lofty heights of Hon
Sec. With a bland and insipid
advertising campaign involving well
known works of art, joints,
fluorescent paper and bolder than
bold fonts, he hopes to out wit (or
blind) the competition, of which
there is none. Why did you pull out
Charles? Fear, maybe. Did Max
and his bunch of heavies in the RCS
office put pressure on to lobotomise
you for real if you went ahead an
stood for Hon Sec?
Assuming (God forbid) that New
Election loses in the battle for Hon
Sec, what is the likelihood that Max
will get Rachel fred Basset to do
most of the job that he was elected
to do, as he has done with being
B/sht editor this year?
President
With the qualifications of working
behind the bar and being a Maths
Dep Rep (major responsibility -
NOT), Andy feels that he can
competently handle the position of
IC President. Unlike Rachel, who
wants to adopt ideas that are more
college wide, Andy wants to make
the Union building a very nice place
to work and play in by pouring cash
into the toilets and keeping the bar
prices down; this will ensure the
vote from the Rugby team (it
worked for the current President).
He and Rachel are very friendly and
easy to talk to, I'll give them that.
But does Andy know what to do?
Deputy President
Otherwise infamous for his soft-
focus, baby-cuddling poster
campaign, (he denies the allegation
of having the collagen implants in
his lips), David went for the
alternative type of manifesto. He
claims to have sat on a number,
planned a career and worked as a
Union steward. Which one do you
think he is telling the truth about?
From the posters, it is apparent
that David has soft skin...it is not,
however, thick. This man is very
touchy. For example, when we first
printed his proposer's name, and
got it ever so slighdy wrong, he left
an attention grabbing message for
Jonty, reminding him of who the
real proposer was. He also resented
quite strongly, the implication that
he wanted to spend another year
drinking with his RCS buddies. Is
it true then?
Any way, I digress. The point is,
although I haven't really spoken to
Hugh that much, I can only judge
him on the manifesto; OK, except
for the bush-baby description
(Hugh—shoot your proposer for
saying that); and his posters, which
certainly are the most original and
certainly grabbed my attention more
than David's Blatant Engineering
Ploy.
Felix Editor
OK. No holds barred. Despite the
fact that I will have to work with
possibly one of these two next year,
I will say what I think.
Firstly, Poddy. Hmmmmm. He's
secretive for one thing. On several
occasions he has refused to tell me
what his tiny messages mean and
why he calls himself Poddy. He is
also extremely argumentative when
his journalistic work is criticised.
For example, a lovely dispute
between him and Beccy broke out
last week, over the fact the she
claimed that there were not enough
mainstream artists on the music
pages and he began to draw up a list
of what records that were reviewed,
got into the charts. This led to a row
over what is mainstream, at which
point I attempted to add fuel to the
fire in but was prevented by
Poddy's refusal to accept my
definition of mainstream. A closed
mind. That's another characteristic
of Poddy.
Now Eccy. She has the editorial
experience that Poddy lacks
(HandBook, AP) but she has the
disadvantage of knowing Steve
Newhouse intimately. Poddy, from
what I can conclude from office
gossip, goes through women like
most people go through tissues. I
digress again. Leccy offers a more
logical layout of Felix while Poddy
offers one where anything legal
(bugger morality), gets printed. I
would like to see a combination of
what both candidates are offering.
New election, possibly?
But wait! There is an option!
Whiskas The Mouse! Definitely
the animal for the job. Yes.
Abosulety. Vote Whiskas on
March 8th 9th for a year of
Felices you'll never forget.

If many guys having recently
written to Felix are to be believed,
Islam is an ultimately rational,
peaceful and loving way of life—
only constantly insulted and
misunderstood by Western greed
and ignorance.
Let's examine some of its bases
and claims: The Holy Koran would
have been revealed or dictated to the
now famous Muhammad around
610 A D by the archangel Gabriel
(yep, a Jewish archangel!), who
kept appearing to him throughout
most of his life as a prophet.
In spite of this, it has probably
been edited and re-written many
times since. There is much
argument as to what may have
disappeared or been inserted, like
for any other Holy Book.
Apparently some verses 'inspired
by Satan' were removed after
Gabriel 'himself denied having
revealed them, (see 22.51 for
experts) and some found missing
when Uthman compiled the Koran
(the Verse of Stoning—or how to
punish adultery).
Anyway, this doesn't tell us if the
prophet smoked grass or tripped out
on long fasts, as was common in his
surroundings and maybe he just 'hit
lucky' like Moon or Ron Hubbard
today.
What is certain is that many
aspects of his teachings smell like
rip-offs from the Jewish and
Christian worlds, with which he
was very familiar and in close
contact. Have a look at the food
laws and Sura 17:23—40
(remember some
Commandments?).
Before I'm tempted to drift all
over the place, let me say the
problem of hallucinating
prophets/messiahs, lucky dogma
and incomplete Books of Truth is
typical for any religion whose great
heroes are dead, so no personal
grudges are held.
This was just to show Islam is not
terribly rational either compared to
other monotheistic 'revealed'
religions, and that if there is some
Creator, hell knows what book or
people or country he's chosen, or
who he wants killed in His name!
Just to end, here are some
extracts of the Koran for ignorant
Westerners like myself:
'Fight those who do not believe
in Allah (...) and do not forbid what
God and his apostle have forbidden'
(Sura 9:29).
'Men have authority over women
because God has made the one
superior to the other (...)' (Sura
4:31, and see 2:228).
'Slay the polytheists wherever
you find them' (Sura 9:5).
Thanks for the Hindus, Women,
Humanists and Rushdies of this
world. Best wishes for Peace and
Love.
