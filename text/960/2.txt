Garden's closing Dr Barry Hall
Rumours that Garden Hall will be
closing next year have been
intensifying this week. Dr Simon
Walker, warden of Weeks and
Garden Hall, was unavailable for
comment, but Dr Ian Metcalfe, sub-
warden of Garden Hall, said that
these rumours had been circulating
for some time. Dr Metcalfe stated
that it had been suggested that the
hall might be closing this year. He
went on to say that, if the hall was
to close it would so that work could
be done to bring the hall into line
with fire regulations. He also said
that he is 'more optimistic than ever
before that the hall will be improved
and that if it is I don't think it will
have to close.'
However, doubts were expressed
at recent Advisory Group
Residents' Meetings as to the
availability of Garden Hall next
year as a student residence. The
Advisory Group is body made up
of Student representatives, Hall
Wardens and College Management,
which advises the Rector on
accommodation policy. Questions
raised are believed to centre around
the capacity of Garden Hall to pass
a Health and Safety inspection in its
current state of repair.
As yet no re-applicants or Re-
Apps, students who spend an extra
year in a hall, have been allocated.
This delay in allocation, when all
other Imperial College Halls are
going through the process of giving
out Re-App places, has fuelled the
speculation about Garden's future.
The Advisory Group on
Residences was consulted as to the
cost of the refurbishment; said to be
very high, and this is believed to be
the reason why a decision has not
yet been made over the hall's
immediate future.
IC Student for ULU
Ben Mancock, an Imperial College
student is standing for the post of
Vice President (Finance and
Societies) in the University of
London Union.
He will be the first Imperial
Student to have stood for a U L U

and has been proposed by Chris
Davidson, ICU President, and Jonty
Beavan, Felix Editor.
If successful in his bid, Mr
Mancock will represent the entirety
of the students of the University of
London that includes Imperial. The
election will take place at a special
General Union Council in which
elected delegates from each of the

Sadly, Barry died suddenly, on
Tuesday 2nd March, following a
heart attack. He will be
remembered by many students as
the Senior Tutor in Mechanical
Engineering from 1987 to 1992.
Barry joined the staff in 1962 and
spent a spell as Assistant Director
before becoming Senior Tutor. He
took early retirement last September
to follow his many and varied
interests in the arts and,travel. All
his friends in Mech Eng and
throughout the College will miss
him, as Barry still continued to
show an interest in everyone and
often visited to see friends. Barry
is survived by his wife Gill, his two
sons Graham and Robert and his
daughter Lesley.
