Greece
There's more to Greece than Shirley Valentine and Stavros, examine the
real history of Greece below.
Greece is a country of the North
Eastern Mediterranean with 10
million inhabitants for an area of
51,000 sq miles. It has 3,100
islands, which extend throughout
the Aegean Sea, to the East and
South of the mainland, and part of
the Ionian Sea, which separates
Greece from Italy to the West.
Athens is the capital city, as it
used effectively to be during the
golden era of the Classical Greek
period (7th-4th century BC). At that
time it shared supremacy with
Sparta in the Peloponese, less
famous for its cultural heritage than
for its Constitution, the nearest
approach to Plato's political ideal,
and, above all, the courage and
sacrifice of its soldiers (Leonidas
and the battle he delivered with his
three hundred men against tens of
thousands of Persians at
Thermopylae gave Greece a defeat
so glorious it is still remembered
after 2,500 years). Today, Salonica,
the capital city of the region of
Macedonia, which spans most of
northern Greece, is the second most
important city.
Every country has at least one
period of its history which it is
particularly proud of; Greece has at
least two.
The first starts with the Minoan
Civilisation (Crete from 3,000 BC)
and Mycenae (Peleponese 1,600
BC). A time so remote and so grand
that Homer's descriptions were
thought to be an elaborate legend,
until excavations at the end of the
19th century revealed that Troy had
really existed and had been captured
by a supreme civilisation. The
palace of Minos in Crete was also
uncovered.
This age ended some 3,000 years
later, after having given birth to the
mathematicians Euclid and Thales,
the scientists Archimedes and
Aristarchus, the philosophers
Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, the
playwrights Aeschylus and
Sophocles, the historians Plutarch
and Herodotus, the statesmen Solon
and Pericles, and countless others.
Although Greece had known
absolute military, economic and
political supremacy, at a time when
Southern Italy and Asia Minor (now
Turkey) and, under Alexander the
Great (4th century BC), Persia,
Egypt, India and what is now
Afghanistan were co'onised, this is
not its main legacy. What was left
behind were ideas, words, a
powerful language and an ideal of
beauty and reason.
Even though sciences like
chemistry and medicine, and arts
such as painting and music had
existed from the dawn of mankind,
the Greeks endowed them with the
theoretical structures necessary for
their progress. Their way of
thinking in Mathematics is the only
one which is of any use in modern
times (Euclidean Geometry,
trigonometry); Hippocrates was the
first physician to attempt an
explanation of the workings of the
body and to establish a code of
medical ethics, still largely followed
in our day.
Sculpture reached unsurpassed
naturalistic expression of the human
body, imitated again in Europe
during the Renaissance, whilst
architectural forms of the time are
still today's paradigms.
Although the oldest litterary text
was probably Assyrian, Homer,
Pindar and their many successors
defined by their works the epic, the
ode, the elegy, the comedy, the
tragedy, i.e. the fundamental poetic
and theatrical genres.
Aristotle is today considered not
only an early physicist but also the
forefather of classical biology, and
Democritus the founder of the
atomic theory.
The importance of this age cannot
be overstated: Greeks themselves
are often surprised at the amount of
Greek mythology and philosophy
interspersed in the books and works
of art of all later times, or to see,
when walking in London some
church built like an ancient Greek
temple.
This era ended with Roman
invasion in 145BC but, two hundred
years later, the Christian Era started
under wonderful auspices. Saint
Paul taught the Macedonians, the
Athenians and the Corinthians, and
all the New Testament except St
Matthew's Gospel was originally
written in Greek. Constantinople
(Byzantium) was founded in the
year 330 A D , inaugruating a new
period of might for the Greeks,
since Constantine's Eastern Roman
Empire was, by the year 480,
completely hellenised. The latin
Western Roman Empire soon
crumbled under the barbarian
tribes' invasions, but the Eastern
(Byzantine) Empire lasted for
another thousand years, until
Constantinople fell to the Turks in
1453.
Though it was a mediaeval
Christian empire (of Orthodox
creed, like today's Greece) the auto-
da-fes of Catholic France and Italy
and, later, Spain, England and the
Protestant Switzerland, were never
to be found there. Theological
arguments were concluded in
rhetorical jousts and many western
travellers were surprised to see the
preponderant place of women in
that society.
Until the crusades of the 13th
century, no western kingdom was
comparable in power and wealth to
the Byzantine Empire.
After a very long period of
Turkish occupation, from 1453
until the Greek Revolution of 1821,
which led to the proclamation of the
modern Hellenic state, Greece
