Neo-Tokyo Explodes
ICSC, in association with the Japan
Society, is pleased to present its
cyberpunk film evening on Monday
night. The evening starts at 6pm
with a special widescreen (and
subtitled) showing of the first full-
length animated Manga feature to
reach these shores, Akira. In
AD2019 Neo-Tokyo, Japan, a
young boy called Tetsuo naturally
develops unusual telekinetic
powers, through which he gets
involved in a secret military
operation. Thirty years earlier,
events surrounding a similarly
gifted boy by the name of Akira led
to an explosion of nuclear
proportions. As Tetsuo's powers
develop, so does his psychosis as he
goes out of control, leading to a
final confrontation between Tetsuo
and Akira who has been kept in
stasis away from the outside world.
Meanwhile, the military bosses
trying to contain Tetsuo's rage have
to contend with a traitor in their
midst, trying to ignite a revolution.
The animation in the film is
extraordinary and unlike that seen
anywhere else, while the
outstanding script also bears little
resemblance to any of the standard
examples of cyberpunk that western
science fiction has produced.
The other film of the evening,
which starts at 8.20pm, is
Hardware. The film is British, was
inspired by a story in '2000AD'
magazine, is very low budget (don't
worry, though, this doesn't show)
and is occasionally reminiscent of
"The Terminator', in that the action
revolves around a robot
programmed to kill. There,
however, the similarities end, as the

For only £11 Men £12 Women
Check us out !
'Mark 13' robot in Hardware is
actually a population control device,
intended to kill virtually anyone it
comes into contact with.
Mysteriously discovered in the
desert, parts of the robot are given
by a trader dying from nuclear
contamination to his gMfriend..The
robot starts to repair itself and sets
out on a murderous rampage to
fulfil its mission. The movie has
beautiful photography, much in the
tradition of Bladerunner, a sturining
soundtrack of British rock and a
fleeting cameo by Iggy Pop.
Entry to both films is FREE to all
members of both the Japan Society
and ICSF, and there is also an
opportunity to join either (or both)
of the clubs, ICSF membership is
just £3 and the show starts at 6pm
in Chem Eng LT1 on Monday the
8th.
Proud to be a
part of Mines
in my capacity as the RSMU Sports
Officer I would like to say a few
words about this weekend. First of
all, for any of you who dont know,
we lost; Squash 0-5, Ladies Hockey
0-1, Men's Hockey 0-3, Football
1-3, and the Bottle Match 3-7. To
anyone who didn't see any of the
matches, this may sound pretty
horrendous, but anyone who was at
Harlington on Saturday, and many
thanks to those who were, will
appreciate that nothing was given
away by any of the R S M teams.
There has been the usual complaints
about the lack of sports facilities,
the use of ringers, dodgy decisions
etc, but it doesn't do any good or
change the results. All that can be
said is that, despite the tremendous
efforts of all the squads (note squad,
not team), we were unlucky and
Camborne had the better teams on
the day. On top of that, the matches
were played in good spirit and we'
were admirable in defeat, resulting
in very little trouble at the dinner
or int he bar. On this basis, I can
say that after this weekend I am
proud to wear an RSM Hockey shirt
and am proud to be part of the
Royal School of Mines.
Finally, there are a few people I
would like to thank. Paul Holmes,
Gina Mortley, Rick Bilby and all
the squad captains for their help and
support. Greg Rule (for picking me
for the hockey team), Prof Shaw
(Dean of RSM) for his timely
intervention, Felix printing unit,
and Tiggy, for putting up with me!
PS congratulations to Boris
Plukowski (Man of the Bottle
Match)!
