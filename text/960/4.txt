5 March 1993 Felix 960
Elections' Beit Back
Dear Jonty,
What's this I see—another faux
pas in Beit Back? 'Elsewhere in this
edition of Felix you will find the
manifestos...'. At least three people
must have hastily flicked through to
find the said manifestos. Imagine
their disappointment when they
weren't there. End of sarcasm and
onto corrections. I'm not going to
comment on the attacks on
candidates because I think anyone
who bothered to read Beit Back will
have had a chuckle and then treated
them with the contempt they
deserve. However, I would like to
jump to the defence of Rag and all
the Raggies who have put in loads
of work by saying that if Rag's
previous year was brilliant, this one
was even better—we are currently
almost £15,000 up on last year's
total and still have a term to go.
One other quick query. How
come P J Dodd is allowed to reply
to letters in the same issue in which
they are published, with the reply
appearing before the letter too! Yet,
anyone else has to wait a week to
reply, even if they get their reply
in before the letters deadline of 1pm
on Monday? This has happened at
least three times already this year.
Are you going to let it happen?
Yours, as ever,
Rachel Mountford, Rag Chair.
Dear Jonty,
Another week, another 'Beit
Back'. This week it's on the
elections! Hooray! Some more
anonymous slagging off.
However, if anybody really
wants to know what the candidates'
policies and aims are, then get hold
of the flyers and manifestos or
better still talk to the candidates who
should be out trying to find you.
Don't take the word of a nobody,
decide for yourself.
Cheers,
Andy Wensley.
Dear Jonty,
I was amused to find my past
described as 'chequered' in last
week's Beit Back, particularly as I
am assured that it was written by a
man whose qualifications include
being SCC chair, Union steward
and assorted other sad hack jobs,
not forgetting, of course, that he's
been intimately involved with my
opponent.
Love,
Lise Yates/Ian Davies.
Dear Jonty,
Oddly enough, I have a slight
complaint about last week's Beit
Back, as probably do most of the
candidates (except the two who the
author seems to favour). I would
say that this amazing piece of
literature appears to be the work of
a sad and bitter individual who
would, themselves have stood, but
realised that they were just about as
popular around College as a bad
case of syphilis. Thus they chose to
slag off everyone else instead—but
then again, I hear that you were
responsible for a large proportion
of it.
Yours, as always,
David (Hugh Eland and New
Election are also standing for
Deputy President) Goddard.
Homophobia
Dear Jonty,
I have never felt it necessary to
write to Felix before, basically
because nothing you have ever
printed has drawn me to do so.
Blatant sexist behaviour by men or
women doesn't bother me, and I
value other people's opinion.
However something at last has
made me angry! What I am talking
about is open, blatant homophobia!
Who am I talking about—well
Rachel Mountford of course. I am
disgusted at the way some
supposedly intelligent and well
informed students as are present at
Imperial College, feel it necessary
to sabotage a legitimate IC Union
presidential campaign by defacing
and tearing down numerous posters.
I do not understand what her private
life has to do with whether or not
she will do a good job. She has been
an excellent Rag Chair this year and
has helped towards the raising of
large amounts of cash. The Rag
events this year were a resounding
success! What I would like to know
is what are the men afraid of. She
won't be chasing them! I am a
female, and I aih not worried by her
sexual preferences. What is the
problem of some people here?
The point is.. .will she do a good
job? And will she do it better than
Andy? I personally believe so!
Oh by the way, I am heterosexual
and not a Union or Rag 'hack' I
simply think Rachel ought to be
given the credit and chance that she
deserves.
