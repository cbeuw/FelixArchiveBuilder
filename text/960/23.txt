Theatre
O n the Piste
On the Piste is a comedy about five
British tourists staying in a cheap
ski resort in Austria. The action
takes place 'on the piste' and this
is a remarkable technical
achievement—there is an actual
slope on the stage! Together with
the hotel and the chair-lift these
ingenious stage props are
guaranteed to instill the sort of
atmosphere that can only be found
in a ski resort.
The characters are brilliantly
portrayed and we get a good
impression of the situation being
presented: two couples in which the
men have lost interest despite the
attempts of the women to revive the
relationship, a lonely yet
unattainable (or so it seems) woman
who joins their group to forget her
husband's infidelity, and a macho
ski instructor totally obsessed with
his body.
This gives excellent material for
the usual sentimental quid-pro-quo
but instead the farce concentrates
mainly on the cruelty and lack of
sensitivity displayed by the men.
This ranges from inane attempts at
poetry: 'This snowman, like our
love, will never melt!' to downright
abuse: 'Stupid Cow!'.
The intended effect is to make the
audience laugh while
simultaneously grit their teeth at
such a disturbing display of male
inadequacy, the danger is you might
end up just gritting your teeth...
