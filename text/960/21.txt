Tales
Preconceptions. There's a danger.
Sting must be a leading artist in the
preconception stakes - picture, if
you will, his new album - a
smouldering, steamy pile of blather
and gunk from an overly eco-
friendly has-been trying to regain
his long lost youth with The Police.
Right?
Wrong. And I thought I was
going to have such fun with this
one, but instead I find myself eating
my hat (you know, the one with
bells on...). I sensed it all going
terribly wrong with the opening
track, the niggling and addictive 'If
I ever lose faith in you'. 'Seven
Days', mind, provides some much
needed ammunition; a middle-aged
'Friday, I'm in love', with
rerniniscences of 'Can't stand losing
you', and plundering from 'Every
little thing she does is magic'. And
the title disturbs me; either Sting has
no grasp of the use of the
apostrophe, or he can't count. Still,
I'm grasping at straws.
Easily the best thing Sting has
released in years. Don't take that as
unreserved praise though.

Expectations
If it were the lyrics which were
special about this album, then
reviewing it would be a doddle.
Quote a couple of elegant lines, and
hey Tasmin, there you are.
Unfortunately, it's not the lyrics,
it's the tunes. So, short of making
sense only to those who have
already heard this album and
waxing melodical about 'track one,
yeah! La la laa lalala, oh and also
track three, dadadee dadadumm',
I'll have to think of another way to
put it across.
Including the songs that have
already had a lot of airtime on
national radio, like Sleeping
Satellite, In Your Care and Lords
of the New Church, Tasmin
Archer's debut album demonstrates
that her tune-writing capabilities are
on a par with whoever wrote
Des'ree's 'Feel So High' or even
some of Tori Amos's best.
The diverse range of issues
tackled over the course of this
album includes child abuse, the
global struggle for human rights,
and the space race. However, I feel
Archer's talents are really on the
musical side. Put her in a room with
a poet, and who KNOWS what
would happen.

54:40: Dear Dear
Dear dear, indeed. It could almost
be a nevermind of a title couldn't
it? I read, during my pursuit of the
meagre circular that is press
information, that 54.40 are the
leaders of Canada's 'alternative
rock' scene. Well now, I'm pleased
for them; and there was you,
expecting some quick-witted
throwaway line to disseminate
critical judgement in the most
succinct manner. Ha. They don't
call me predictable Dave, I'll have
you know.
The circular goes on to say they
caused riots on their summer tour;
I hope everyone was okay, no
broken limbs, cuts or bruises. I
hope no-one lost any money while
they were in the crowd, or had their
pockets picked. In short, I hope you
all had a fucking nice time. And
onto the band. The photo we have
of them appears to depict a mid-
seventies west coast rock band, like
The Eagles, or Supertramp; they're
too old, and their hair's too long by
seven eigths. They're probably
perfectly nice people, but they can't
crack a rock god pose to save their
lives, and their songs are shit. I
therefore suspect that the
qualification for 'alternative' in this
case involves some combination of
Pearl Jam and Wishbone Ash,
which leaves us just about... fuckin'
hell! these guys are just so off-the-
wall!

54.40: Because Brett is too beautiful for these pages.
S u e d e — A n i m a l Nitrate
Some people accuse Suede of being
a victory of style over content, of
being all blouse and no front, but
like all bands they need to develop.
One could only describe their
performance at the Brits as
shambling brilliance. It seemed on
the evidence of that night that
impending fame and Brett's
downward plunge into drug-fixated
psychosis would conspire against
the band at all levels.
'The Drowners' had its moments,
'Metal Mickey' was a fine record,
but 'Animal Nitrate', an ode to
drug-induced homosexual brutality,
is not the great record that maybe
it should have been. Brett's languid
vocal delivery, not for the first time,
seems at odds with Bernard's
accomplished guitar artistry which
resonates with warmth and feeling.
Saying that, it's still a good record
and easily pisses over the
competition.
'Painted People' and 'The Big
Time', where Brett at least gives the
impression that he's ready to accept
the constraints of fame, are
promising signs of the band's new-
found studio maturity, and give a
good indication of what to expect
from the album.

The Adventures: Surrender Dorothy!
T h e A d v e n t u r e s -
Tigers & Bears
L i o n s &
Heralded as a return to the bitter
pop songs of 88's 'Sea of Love',
'Lions & Tigers & Bears' is
actually, in the main, closer to The
C u r v e / A p h e x T w i n —
Fall Free
This remix bears no resemblance to
the original, which is perhaps a
good thing since the original (taken
from the 'Horror Head' E.P.) was
instantly forgettable.
Minimalist to the point of taking
the piss, a Toni Halliday vocal drifts
uneasily through an alien technoid
backdrop of beats and bleeps. The
end product is seemingly a hybrid
of all the Aphex Twin's alter-egos.
Harder than anything on his recent
'R & S' and 'Warp' albums but
retaining the distinct feel of
ambience associated with those
works - this record is a strong
addition to his already impressive
discography. The future of credible
dance music is in his hands.
Leo.
Adventures third album, 'Trading
secrets with the moon'. There are
exceptions, of course; 'The only
world I know' boasts harmonies
virtually identical to their own
'Send my heart'. They cover
'Monday Monday' seemingly to
wrest a hit out of The Adventures,
but succeeds in appearing merely a
tacked-on failure that's tacky if
competent. Again, 'This crazy
heart' seems initially reminiscent of
the Hothouse Flowers' 'Giving it all
away'.
But, I guess, like that third
album, this will grow on me (what?
sort of like a lichen?-sic. Ed). I
remember only liking one, or two,
tracks for the first few weeks, and
I begrudged them that- this time
those tracks are translated into the
annoyingly catchy 'Raining all over
the world', the first single from the
album, and the dark (oh, it couldn't
be brooding, could it?-sic. Ed),
brooding 'I don't want to play this
game'. Recommended, but not
highly.
