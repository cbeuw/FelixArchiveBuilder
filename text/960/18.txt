Cyprus
The Island of Aphrodite has inspired love and war over the milennia, read
on to discover more
When Aphrodite—the goddess of
love and beauty—emerged from the
foaming Cypriot surf she couldn't
have picked a more appropriate
place to do it. Because Cyrpus
inspires the love of all who visit.
Cyprus is the third largest island
in the the Mediterranean. It has a
mediterranean climate and the
atmosphere and architecture of its
towns and villages is decidedly
Greek, but with a strong hint of the
East. Virtually all the ancient
civilisations met at this crossroads
of Europe, Asia, Africa and Asia
Minor and its rich cultural heritage
is loaded with myth and legend and
a supreme legacy of archeological
sites.
Cyprus history can be traced back
to the time of Neolothic man in
7,000 B C . The island's name in
Greek is 'Kypros'. The island's
goddess Afrodite was known as
'kipris' in Greek. The island gave
also its name to 'kuprum' the latin
word for copper after the vital
discovery of significant copper
deposits in Cyprus. News of this
great fortune brought visitors in
droves, some to trace and some to
start a new life. It was during this
period that mainlaind Greeks settled
in Cyprus and hellenised the island.
From those ancient times the
country has retained its Greek
heritage, its language, traditions and
way of life.
The island's position was such
that for the next 27 centuries it was
invaded and ruled by more than a
dozen different masters. After
several years of struggle for
independence, Cyprus was
declared, through the Zurich
agreement, an Independent
Republic in 1960. In July 1974 a
coup was staged in Cyprus by the
Military Junta (then in power in
Athens) and this was followed by
a Turkish invasion (20th July 1974).
Since then 37% of the island has
been under Turkish military
occupation and 200,000 Greek
Cypriots (40% of the total Greek
Cypriot population) have become
refugees.
With such a historic and
legendary background it is hardly
surprising that Cyprus has
developed a character which is quite
unique. It is blessed with beauty-
natural beauty that ranges from
golden beaches and rugged
coastlines to rolling hills and forest
clad mountains, dotted with
picturesque villages.
The climate of Cyprus never fails
to delight her visitors, and every
season has a charm and beauty of
its own.
Nicosia or 'Leftkosia' (in Greek)
is the capital of Cyprus, a status it
has enjoyed for 1000 years since the
10th centry. Limassoki is the south
coast town which is the island's
largest seaside resort. Larnaca and
Paphos are two other seaside resorts
of Cyprus each having an
International airport.
The towns of Cyprus present a
modern cosmopolitan atmoshere
blended with historic buildings and
ancient monuments. Imposing
colonial and classic style buildings,
rub shoulders with well designed
contemporary hotels, apartment
blocks and attractive shopping
streets, some narrow and quaint,
others thoroughly modern.
By contrast, life in villages
follows a slower pace, reflecting the
importance of agriculture, cottage
industry and family ties. Traditional
flat-roofed village houses made of
mud brick are a common sight,
white stone-built dwellings with
tiled roofs can be seen in the
mountains.
The people of Cyprus are
traditionally warm and welcoming,
and consider a visit to their island
as a compliment—one that's repaid
with genuine hospitality, summed
up in the Greek word Philokenia;
Friendship towards the guest. Their
native tongue is Greek.
The pace is leisurely, the people
kind and helpful, always ready with
a smile.
The gastronomic pleasures of
Cyprus includes the famous
'meze'—meaning mixture. As
many as thirty dishes may form the
meze—starting with dips, salads,
and vegetables advancing to hot
dishes—including such favorites as
Moussaka and kebabs as well as
tasty local casseroles, fresh fish and
chicken—and finishing with sweets
like Baklava and loucoumades.
Cyrpus wines, inexpensive and
plentiful, make a good
accompaniment to this exotic and
lingering experience.
Religion and celebration are
deeply entwined and the most
important event in the church
calendar is the occasion of Easter.
Another popular religious festival
and one which is unique to Cyprus
is 'Kataklysmos' meaning the
'Flood' which cooincides with
Pentecost, and is celebrated at
seaside towns.
But festive excuses are not hard
to find, every village has its
'panagyri' or fair, usually at harvest
time. The carnival, chiefly in
Limassol is celbrated with parades,
parties and masked balls, and there
are cultural festivals in summer
including the ancient Greek Drama
festival.
Yet, despite this wealth of
treasures and pleasures, the most
memorable thing about Cyprus is
the warmth of its people—as warm
as the climate and as delightful as
its many resorts. But isn't that all
you'd expect of an island which has
given centuries to leisure and
pleasure.
