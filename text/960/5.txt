West Fights Back Euroshopping
Dear Jonty,
M r Abdullah in the last issue of
Felix offered us some criticisms of
Western Civilisation. Although his
religious fervour was impressive,
his attempt to enlighten us as to how
Islam is superior to the Western
(Christian) Civilisations is not such
a 'not-so-long established tree' as
Mr Abdullah might think. The tree
has its roots in Ancient Greece and
Rome and has been growing for at
least 25 centuries, bearing copious
fruit, beginning with philosophy of
Plato and Aristotle, through St
Thomas Aquinas' thought,
mediaeval Gothic architecture,
Shakespeare's poetry in
Renaissance, all the way to the
twentieth century with phenomena
such as Picasso's art or Gershwin's
music.
Secondly, I think that M r
Abdullah should understand, that
one shouldn't criticise a culture by
confusing it with the government.
Last week we were given some
horrible statistics concerning British
society (high crime rate, poverty,
etc) and the blame was put on the
Western culture (incidentally, I
would be interested to see the
sources of those statistics).
In the same way, one could offer
some drastic examples taken from
the world of Islam. Saudi Arabia
International
Night
Dear Jonty,
I write in today looking back at
last year's International Nite. A
tremendous effort and a marvellous
performance, but sadly the purpose
of spreading the cultures of the
world was not fully achieved. I say
this with regard to the small number
of home students present at last
year's event.
One glance at the crowd present
would tell you that it was almost
entirely a 'foreign affair'. That was
not the intention at all. We did not
come from all corners of the world
just to see what we already know,
we came to learn and also to share.
In just one night we hope to share
a lot with you, please don't waste
this effort.
Around the world people long for
cultural diversity, longing to know
and to learn of the world around
them and here at IC with over
twenty overseas societies I find it
strange that these are people who
formally abolished slavery only in
the 1960s, and reports of the
practice still occur in some nomadic
Arab tribes, where boys are said to
sell for $240, girls for $160. One
could argue here, that it is the
Western ideas of equality that
contributed to the abolition of
slavery in many parts of the world.
The Koran stipulates that 'men
have authority over women because
Allah has made the one superior to
the other'. The renowned Islamic
scholar Ibn Taymiyya advises,
'When a husband beats his wife for
misbehaviour, he should not exceed
ten lashes.'Many of non-Western
cultures have deeply ingrained ideas
of male superiority, and phenomena
like emancipation of women are
simply not indiginous to non-
Western cultures.
The above examples were not
meant to offend the Muslim
community, but to point out to the
author of the letter 'How to save
your soul', M r Abdullah, that
attacks on the Western heritage are
not the best idea, if one wishes to
make Islam more attractive to the
Westerners. Understanding, rather
than confrontation should be the
goal.
Sincerely,
L M Urban, Biochemistry.
don't know how lucky they are.
I wrote in after last year's
International Night and have
probably repeated myself here but
I guess I was a little too late then.
With a food fair and cultural show
followed by a disco and live band
you have everything to gain. Don't
give this year's show a miss, please.

Dear Jonty,
I read with interest the article in
Felix 958 on 'Europshopping', and
as a seasoned day tripper would
offer the following tips in addition
to the article.
To save money on the crossing,
without having to buy crap
newspapers, join the 'Ferry Travel
Club'. This is operated by The
Travel Market Ltd., Channel View
Road, Dover, Kent CT16 1XJ (Tel
(0304) 213533). It costs £5 per year
membership, and you can travel on
their special offers as many times
as you like. The current offer (until
April 2nd) allows foot passengers
to travel for £1. A car with up to
5 people costs just £25 (with a
supplement of £15 if you go on a
Saturday). They also offer discounts
on standard ferry rates for holidays,
and several short breaks.
Continental breakdown insurance
and medical cover is available for
£6.
Take the car, bring back loads of
booze, and avoid the back strain.
You can also drive to Bologne and
shop at the 'Auchan' hypermarket
which is bigger (but busier) that
those in Calais. Bologne is also a
nicer town that Calais.
If you (and the car!) can stand
Dear Jonty,
We would like to clear up some
of the rumours that have been
circulating about Linstead Hall Bar
last week. As you may be aware,
the Bar was closed on Monday night
after the powers that be at Sherfield
said there was an error in our
accounting procedure. This was
immediately found to be a gross
exaggeration and one that we see as
yet another attempt by catering
management and in particular
Simon Westerman, to disrupt the
running of Linstead Hall Bar.
Simon Westerman has stated that
he wishes to see the closure of our
Bar. Could these recent events have
been a thinly veiled attempt by
catering to start the shutdown of,
not only our Bar, but also those of
Weeks and Beit Halls and, in fact,
any service which does not fall
under their monopoly? What do
they hope to gain by the closure of
a Bar which is the heart and soul of
Linstead Hall? Apart from the
disastrous effect that this would
have on a very social Hall, can
Simon Westerman really be so
naive as to think that a turnover of
just £20,000 pa (of which only a
small amount is profit) could in any
driving about laden, then stock up
as soon as you get there and avoid
the afternoon scramble. The car
also allows you to get off the beaten
track into a village for lunch—you
can try your fractured French here
as they won't speak English.
Don't overload the car, as the
Kent Police are very keen on
weighing cars as well as coaches,
and it would be a shame to have to
give you booze to them.
Remember that you are only
permitted to bring back sealed meat
and dairy products, so don't get
carried away at the Deli counters.
Pay for the booze etc by credit
card—the rates are usually better
than cash exchange. Club together
with friends when changing money
and avoid excessive commission
charges.
Don't be tempted by mains
operated electrical goods, as these
are designed mainly for 220V, and
may not be guaranteed safe at
240V. You may also have difficult
if the thing goes wrong.
I hope these will be of some use.
Give it a try—it can be great fun and
a very cheap way to get tanked up.
Yours faithfully,
Jason Brameld, ex Physics.
way alleviate catering services'
present difficulties?
The events of the last few days
have, for the moment, been
amicably resolved. However, you
can surely appreciate our anxiety
that there may be a recurrence of
this situation. We would like to feel
that we can count on the support of
Felix readers, IC Union and anyone
else with an interest in keeping Hall
Bars alive.
Yours sincerely,
Mark Newton and Vicki Fry,
Linstead Hall Bar Chairman and
Secretary.
