turquoise. Although not counted as
a major export, the Persian cat is
renowned all over the world for its
beauty and grace.
Education is compulsory in Iran
between the ages of 6 and 14.
Primary education is followed by a
three year guidance cycle, which
assesses students' aptitudes and
detennines whether they will follow
an academic, science or vocational
programme during high school.
There are 22 universities in Iran (8
in Tehran including the University
of Tehran founded in 1932 and 14
in the provinces).
Iran's large centres of population
are wideley scattered, and
transportation is made difficult by
mountainous terrain. Motor
vehicles, buses and trucks in
particular, are the most important
means of transportation for both
passengers and goods. The
principal line of the state-owned
railway system spans the distance
between the Caspian Sea and the
Persian Gulf, with spur lines to
some of the provincial capitals.
Karun River in Khuseztan Province
is the only navigable river and is
used to transport passengers and
cargo. Major cities and provincial

capitals are served by the state-
owned Iran Air, and all have
airports handling some major
European, Asian and African
airlines. Tehran, Esfahan, Shiraz
and Bandar-e-Abbas have
international airports.
Finally, there is much more to
say about Iran but it is beyond the
boundaries of this article to deal
with them. However, it is suffice to
say that Iran's strategic position and
its vast resources make it a nation
to be reckoned with in the modern
world.
Turkey
Where East meets West over the Bosphorus, Turkey is one of the world's
oldest civilisations
Turkey, a country that spans two
continents, and which over ten
thousand years has been the home
of the great cultures and
civilisations of the world. Here you
can enjoy the pleasures of east and
west, old and new. From the days
. of Catlhoyuk, the world's first town
which dates back to 6500 B C ,
Turkey boasts a rich culture that
through the centuries has made a
lasting impression on modern
civilisation. The heir to centuries of
consecutive but different cultures
makes Turkey a paradise of
information and cultural wealth.
Hitites, Frigians, Urartuans,
Lydians, Ionians, Persians,
Macedonians, Romans, Byzantines,
Selchuks and Ottomans have all
held important places in Turkey's
history. Ancient sites and ruins
scattered throughout the country
give proof to each civilisation's
unique distinction.
In Turkey, you can see
landscapes of incredible natural
beauty, sites of great antiquity,
towns and villages of lovely
examples of architecture from
Byzantine, Selchuk and Ottoman
times. You can meet a special kind
of people for whom hospitality is a
way of life. Then you can relax:
with over five thousand miles of
coastline, innumerable gorgeous
beaches, and four different seas,
every taste is catered for.
Istanbul, the former capital of
several empires and the only city in
the world built on two continents,
epitomises the essence of Turkey's
charm uniquely forming a bridge
between two continents and two
cultures; the converging point of
ancient and modern. It has infinite
variety: museums, ancient
churches, palaces, great mosques,
bazaars, and the Istanbul Bogazi
(Bosphorus) where the waters of the
Black Sea mingle with those of the
Sea of Marmara and the Gold Horn.
However, Istanbul is not only
historic, it is a magnificent city,
fascinating and vividly alive.
Once you have visited Turkey,
sampled the delicious food and
marvellous drinks, enjoyed the
friendliness and hospitality of
Turkish people you are sure to want
to return again and again.
