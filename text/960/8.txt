Dougie L'Amour guides us all gently through the difficulties of voting
in this year's sabbatical elections.
Monday and Tuesday of next week
(the 8th and 9th of Marchfor all you
diarests) are the two days over
which that annual rip-roaring
rollercoaster event known as the
Sabbattical Elections are taking
place. Eager to have a high turn-
out this year (let's see if with can
all go wild and top the heady
heights of 20%) the charismatic
Dougie L'Amour leads all you
virgin voters (and indeed those not
so virgin voters who could do with
a reminder - please, no names, no
pack drill: We 're not here to score
points, just votes) through the
potentially intellectual minefield
that is the Single Transferable Vote
(STV) System.
STV, as the more enlightened
will know, has nothing to do with
problematic fungi and painful trips
to the toilet, but is in fact the voting
system that John Cleese (and the
other Liberal Democrat) would
stick fly paper to their genitals for,
Y O U , dear voter, don't have to.
because we've go it right here at
Imperial College (STV that is and
not the fly paper).
To be a winner under STV a
candidiate needs more that 50% of
the vote. If no lucky candidate
reaches the finishing line on the first
run out then the least popular
candidate (that's the one with the
fewest votes) is eliminated and their
votes are distributed amongst the
other candidates according to the
second preferences expressed on
those papers. So if 8 out of 10
voters (who expressed a preference)
went for candidate A instead of
candidate B then candidate A would
get 8 more votes and candidate B
the other 2. The sharing out of votes
carries on like this until one tired
and emotional candidate crosses the
magical 50% line and is declared
the winner.
Just to spice up the race there is
also included that unknown
quantity, NEW ELECTION. If this
mystery person wins the election
then a whole new election is called
(no surprises there).
Getting the most out of your vote
is as easy as 1,2,3 (or 1,2,3,4,5,6
if 6 candidates are standing).Even
if your favourite candidate doesn't
reach 50% then by putting 2 next
to your next favourite etc you can
help elect another candidate. But
remember, by putting 1 next to your
choice and 2 next to somebody else
you are not affecting the chances of
your favourite winning.
R E M E M B E R , S T V USES
NUMBERS NOT TICKS A N D
CROSSES. If you mark a paper
with a tick or cross (or dozy fat
tosser etc) then it becomes invalid.
Your vote will have been a waste
of time and you won't have helped
your candidate. Start with a 1 (for
your favourite) and work your way
down, using only each number
once.
If your still confused about STV
then here is an example election to
help
You are given a ballot paper for
President. Tweedle Dum, Tweedle
Dee, Lemming and New Election
are standing. You decide to vote as
follows
Tweedle Dum 4
Tweedle Dee 3
Lemming 1
New Election 2
When all the votes are counted up
(on the first preferences) they
poll
Tweedle Dum
Tweedle Dee
Lemming
New Election
230
270
410
290
1200
But lummy! No one has reached the
50% quota figure of 601,so silly old
Tweedle Dum is eliminated and
his/her second preferences are
shared out. Of Tweedle's 230 votes
175 are given to Lemming, 25 to
New Election, 15 to Tweedle Dee
with 15 having no second
preference. So the candidates
remaining now have the following
votes
Tweedle Dee
Lemming
New Election
Non Transferable
285
585
315
15
1200
Can we guess what happens now?
Yes, that's right, unlucky Tweedle
Dee is shown the door by the voters
and told to get a job (or indeed bathe
in the shallow waters of more
Higher Education). So the quota
now becomes 593 due to non
transferable votes (half of 1185 plus
1). Tweedle Dee's are again shared
out according to the next preference
(those with 1st preference for
Tweedle Dee are shared out to
his/her second preferences, voters
who gave Tweedle Dee a number
two (no sniggering) are shared out
to the third preferences. If any of
these preferences are Tweedle
Dum, then they are shared out to
their next preference. So of
Tweedle Dee's 285 votes 200 go to
Lemming, 35 to New Election and
50 are non transferable (because
they had no further preferences).
After a quick add up the votes
allocated are now
Lemming
New Election
Non Transferable
785
350
65
1200
Hoorah, hoorah, we have a winner.
Lemming pops in the winner, in the
88th minute (must be a Gunner),
over the line by a short head, it was
in ref honest.
I guess there's a fair chance that
most of you gave up on trying to get
your head round STV (please no
titters) as it is quite a complex
system. But it is, as you now
understand^), ridiculously fair and
democratic, which is probably why
the Lib Dems like it so much (where
are they now?). If you do though
wish to know more (not likely) then
go see I>>minic Wilkinson the Hon.
Sec., who has the superjob of being
the Returning Officer (the posh
name for the sad individual who
counts the votes). The only question
now remaining is
Where and when can we do it? First
off. This is actually two questions,
but hey we're all friends. If you
want to vote (you do, you do) then
you must have a valid Union Card
with you. If you have a grant, then
you have a card, so no excuses. All
you have to do is approach a ballot
box, smile (because a smile costs
nothing and could brighten up your
day), show your card, and you're
off!.
You'll be given a voting slip for
each candidate, but remember,
number your choices in order of
preference, putting 1 by your
favourite etc.
And so to recap with the take
home messages

JCR, the Union, Silwood Park,
