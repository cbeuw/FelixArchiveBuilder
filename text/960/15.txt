the path to the front door flanked

warm welcome to a household

prepared to mark the occasion.
Singapore is also a glutton's
paradise. At all times of the day and
night, people indulge their passion
for steaming bowls of noodle-laden
soup, spicily sauced crab, delicately
braised chicken, flavoured satay
and spicy curry.
When the air is redolent with the
mouth-watering aromas of garlic,
chilli and ginger, a walk around the
Lawker centre is like taking a
cook's tour through the pages of an
Asian cookbook.
Singapore has a lot more ot offer.
A city of many colours and
contrasts, cultures and cuisines, you

India like a jewel among pebbles, like a sapphire among jewels, like the
jasmine among blossoms, the musk among perfumes, the peacock among
birds, the zodiac among the stars is a nation among nations
Bharat or India as it is known in the
western world, the seat of an
ancient civilisation (Mohenjo-dar),
the creation of two world religions
(Hinduism and Budhism), has her
roots deep in the past. Geography
and history have combined to
produce the human diversity which
strikes every visitor to India. This
diversity has been the result of
Indian genius to be able to
assimilate cultures of various races
which came to India as conquerers.
First came the Persians, the Greeks,
the Huns, the Turks, the Afghans,
the Mughols and finally the British.
All these races of people were
absorbed in the ocean of Indian life
thus generating a kaleidoscope of
cultures, but always remaining
transparent to the underlying and
ancient Vedic culture. India's
genius of assimilation can be
described as adding fresh gems to
the jewel in the lotus to make an
ever more dazzling display.
India like a jewel among pebbles,
like a sapphire among jewels, like
the jasmine among blossoms, the
musk among perfumes, the peacock
among birds, the zodiac among the
stars is a nation among nations. It
is a priceless treasure-house of art,
culture and tradition, the beauty and
diversity of which is evident from
the Vedic temples in South India
and monuments like the Taj Mahal
whose beauty is known all over the
world in North India from the times
of the Mughols. Thousand year old
sculptures and carvings, which
represented at the time, the faith and
feeling of those who executed them
and which still retain their original
impression to this day.
Beauty of India is not only in its
diversity of culture and humans but
also it geography. It is contained by
the Himalayas that guard it in the
north east and Hindu Khush on the
north west. From the Pamir Knot
and beautiful snow covered ranges
dominated by the Karakoram, the
Himilayas curve eastwards like a
gigantic curtain to the junction of
China and Burma.
Imperial College Indian Society
was set up for the purpose of
bringing the Indians closer to their
roots and exposing the non-Indians
to beauty of the diverse Indian
nation. This is exacdy what the
committee of this year has been
trying to do through organisation of
cultural events. Our major event
was in December 1992 on the
occasion of 'Divali' the Indian
festival of lights. Our other efforts
have been trips to the
Commonwealth Institute, the Indian
exhibition at the Victoria and Albert
Museum and a colourful exhibition
of Indian art, food and clothes
during the OSC's International
Week. We also exploit the excellent
opportunity during the OSC's
International Night to expose a
much wider and varied audience to
India through our cultural
performance.
