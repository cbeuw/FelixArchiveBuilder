Parachute Plug
On March 13th, twenty seven crazy
people will be travelling up two
thousand feet in a perfecdy good
aeroplane and then jumping out.
Unfortunately, it is now too late for
any of you who wish to join them
- you should have read last week's
reminder! However, you can still
do your bit by scrawling your name
on any sponsor sheet that one of
these mad parachutists throws at
you - don't worry about the amount,
I'm sure they'll fill that in for you!
Although if you want to be
awkward, you could always
sponsor per broken bone, or per
foot fallen.
Training will be held in College
the week before the jump, in the
SCR and the U D H - the jumpers
can find out the details by
contacting the Rag Office on 8214,
or corning along to the Rag meeting
this Friday. On the day,- we will be
travelling to the London Skysports
jumpsite in a coach, so there is
likely to be plenty of room for
spectators.
Lastly, a gentle reminder to all
those Bungee Jumpers who still
have not paid their sponsorship
money: GET O N WITH IT! I'll be
publishing names next week, and
doing something even nastier after
that, so get those cheques winging
their way to Mike Chamberlain in
the Rag Office post haste.
A parahute jump of sorts..
This year's charities
You, having all thrown loads of
dosh at us during R A G Week, may
be asking where it is all going and
what it will be used for when it gets
there. We are presenting to you a
chart of monies raised so far by
R A G . The money raised in events
will go straight to specific charities
named when that event was
advertised. Money from R A G
Week, merchandise and events such
as The Rocky Horror Disco will be
split up between the following
charities:
Turning Point, Shelter, F A R A ,
Action Research for Multiple
Sclerosis and local charities.
Turning Point is the largest
national charity helping people with
drink, drug and mental health
problems. Founded in 1964 and
operating over 40 projects
throughout the country, Turning
Point provides residential
rehabilitation, day care and street-
level advice and support. In the last
year alone it has helped over 12,000
people, two-thirds of whom were
contacting the charity for the first
time.
Shelter has, for over 20 years,
been waging a war against bad
housing and homelessness. Last
year Shelter helped over 30,000
people, supporting many projects
aimed at mutual support and better
housing. Close to home a west
London scheme offers practical
support to homeless people in the
capital's overcrowded B&B hotels.
F A R A (Faure-Alderson
Romanian Appeal) was established
only in December 1990, and has
taken responsibility for two
institutions in N E Romania, an
orphanage and an asylum. Work at
the orphanage is to encourage the
children and develop their self
confidence. Food, clothes,
medicine, vitamins and educational
equipment has been provided. The
asylum houses 250 adults classed as
mentally ill but in fact most have
physical not mental disabilities.
F A R A has provided running water
at the home, doctors, clothes,
mattresses and blankets etc. A
number of students from IC and
Marys have helped FARA, and
some have actually been to the
orphanage to give the children a
happy Christmas.
ARMS works in a battle against
Multiple Sclerosis, a degenerative
disease of the central nervous
system. It leads to both physical and
emotional problems. ARMS helps
research but emphasises its work on
treating the disease to provide the
best possible quality of life.
Local charities are also
supported, improving our link with
the community. So far we have
already helped a number of local
hospitals, and the remaining
bneficiaries will be chosen at the
end of the year.
R A G is also looking for charities
to nominate for next year, and
suggestions may either be put
forward at the Rag meeting or by
contacting Lorna Mountford in the
Rag Office. This is your chance to
say who Y O U think should benefit
from Rag events and collections,
please make the most of it.
