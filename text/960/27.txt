Hockey?? IC Football
Our taxi-driven start to the mongrel
dog of a patched pitch led to the
lemming of mediocrity playing
havoc with our honey-roasted
peanut of creativity. We didn't play
well either cow. The antelopes
roamed freely in the wide expanses
of our midfield until the lone wolf
of opposition huffed and puffed and
blew our goal down: Our pigs of
defence hadn't drunk themselves
out of the trough of oblivion. Half-
time camel 0-1.
The aardvark of promise poked
about in the ant-hill which was the
second half. The pirahnic jaws of
our attack then stripped raw the
diplodocus of their defence and
swiftly took the lead. The yellow
duck of inevitability landed us in the
pool of sorrow as they equalised. So
the ox of unity ploughed our field
of dreams (final platypus: 2-2).
B'ball lyas, this time really)
On Wednesday (24th Feb), the IC
women's basketball team played
their first game after returning from
Moscow (see Felix 959). The match
was an away match against the
London School of Economics which
is top of the league.
The IC team was playing with
only eight players (the other two,
including the captain Pia Aanstad,
were ill) and two of the eight
players had knee and back injuries
respectively. Despite all of the
problems, IC played an excellent
game keeping up with the
champions until the last three
minutes of the game with one point
difference. LSE took advantage of
our fatigued and injurerd players to
win with a ten point difference.
Nellie Zeniou (also the coach) and
Ildiko Cservenyak were the top
scorers whereas Anette Fidrich did
a great job on defence.
The rematch will be next week in
the volleyball court (behind
Chemistry).
The quarter-final stages of the
indoor soccer tournament took
place this week. The eight teams
that qualified for the quarter finals
were: Pakistan Soc, Lebanese Soc,
Sikh Soc, Anti-Apartheid Soc,
Iranian Soc, Cypriot Soc, Latin
American Soc and the Chinese Soc.
Having played some difficult first
round games the teams were now
faced with the knock-out stage in
which there was no room for
mistakes. All the games proved to
be fast and thrilling, with the
scorelines not truly reflecting the
closeness of the matches.
The Pakistan Soc team yet again
won! Their all round performance,
application and ability was to be
admired. The Cypriot Soc also won
their quarter final match with their
direct and tough approach to
football. The Sikh Soc qualified for
the semi-finals on Wednesday
evening with a solid performance
Dribblers
Following last week's humiliating
defeat (Dribs lost 14-0 to Kings),
the Dribblers were back on fine
form this week against Royal
Hdlloway at Harlington. With
leading goal-scorer Eleanor away
and a team of only ten, things could
have been very difficult but an
excellent goal from Jo from the
edge of the area early on in the
second half put us 1-0 ahead and
caused their goalie to walk off in
disgust. Man of the match has to be
the Royal Holloway supporter who
found herself in goal for the rest of
the match. The Dribblers dominated
the remainder of the match, but
despite some fine chances created
by Paula and Juliette we were
unable to score again. Everybody
played well, especially Caroline and
Christine who managed to remain
upright throughout the whole match
for the first time this season.

against the Chinese Soc. They now
go on to play the Pakistan Soc in the
semi-finals. The other semi-final
will be the Cypriot Soc against the
Anti-Apartheid Soc, who overcame
an excellent Iranian Soc team also
on Wednesday evening. The hard
fought match in which some
excellent football was played by
both teams the Anti-Apartheid just
managed to hold off a resiliant
Iranian team.
With the semi-finals and final to
play, the indoor soccer tournament
has proved to be exciting and
thrilling throughout and I would like
to take this opportunity to thank all
the teams who have contributed,
making the tournament such a great
success.

UAU 5-a-side
On Sunday 28th of February IC
football 1st team travelled to Keele
for the U A U National 5-a-side
tournament. One a snowy, wintry
morning IC's spirits were, to say
the least, low, due to toe and ankle
injuries both T Botzios and A
Fenton respectively and with A
Galloway not having had a minutes
sleep the previous night due to a
horrible toothache, and without R
Dixon who had preferred to go
training in the snow with his U L U
mates.
On arrival at Keele for
registration we looked completely
out of place compared to the other
teams with their ten man squads.
With no substitutes and no training
ball we looked like we were
destined to go out in the first round.
But in our first game against Bath
we were to prove everyone wrong
as we obtained a 1-1 draw after
having missed numerous chances
including a penalty by B Willis. The
next game against U C N W was a
crucial one that had to be won to get
through to the second round, and
we easily surpassed the Welsh
obstacle with a convincing 3-1 win.
Two goals coming from Tellis and
one from Annan who was also
severely cautioned by the referee
for his 'Vinny Jones' style play.
The 2nd round brought us up
against tournament favourites
Liverpool who had two U A U
nationals in their side. An early goal
from free kick specialist T Botzios
gave us the lead which, to
everyone's surprise, we held on to
till the end with some great
defending from BT Willis and some
incredible saves from keeper M
Atherton, which brought shouts of
amazement from the crowd.
For the first time ever an IC side
had proceeded to the quarter-finals
of this particular tournament where
we were to play Southampton who
had lost to Liverpool in the 1st
round. Again we took the lead from
a great curling shot from the
harlway line from A Fenton but did
not manage to retain the lead and
the game ended 1-1. Southampton
brought on their two substitutes in
extra time and their fitness was the
crucial factor. Both sides had
chances to score but Southampton
clinched the winner two mintues
from time but we had no energy left
to equalise and the game was lost
2-1.
Many thanks must go to our
mascot, Bernard the Bear, whose
physical presence on the sidelines
inspired us to our great
performances.
