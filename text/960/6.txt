Invasion of the Comic Tomatoes
Are you looking for a good excuse
to wash your hair with baked beans?
Ever wanted to raise money by
doing your party trick of cleaning
your teeth with the toothbrush held
between your toes? If you have any
silly ambitions or ideas that could
possibly (let's face it, what can't?)
be used to raise money for a good
cause, then now is the time. March
12th heralds the seventh year of
Comic Relief, and this year has
been named the Invasion of the
Comic Tomatoes - this would
explain why the red noses now on
sale from various places round
college have strange little green bits
on the front! You have probably
seen the lit-up splat on the front of
the Natural History Museum, but
have you noticed tomato bike
reflectors? Totally Red packets of
M&Ms? Red Nose Sleepwalker
computer game? Even Global
Hypercolor tomato t-shirts,
available from C&A! These are just
Doing
The
Dirty
Yet again, teams of twelve vicious
raggies will be hitting various
locations and raising hell whilst
raising money. There is little to
report since last week, but for your
information here is a quick resumee
of who is going where: Falmouth
Keogh are heading off to Guildford
to collect for the Leonard Cheshire
Foundation; Bernard Sunley are
heading for the QPR v Norwich
match, collecting for W W F N ;
Willis Jackson are going to Reading
in aid of W W F N , and Garden,
Weeks, Tizard and Southwell are
all staying in London.
Unfortunately, Linstead and Selkirk
do not seem to be able to muster
twelve people for a team. Shame on
you! However, any of you lot from
the decent halls can run along to
your hall reps and beg to be
included in a team. Good luck! and
may the best dozen win.
a few of the ways that cash is being
raised for Comic Relief this year.
Cue the serious bit - Comic Relief
is not just about doing silly things
and having fun. The money raised
goes towards a huge variety of
projects both abroad and at home.
Just to give you some idea: in the
past, grants in Arica have helped to
provide emergency food, medicines
and shelter as well as long term
projects such as developing better
crop strains, controlling soil erosion
and translating health manuals into
local languages; in the UK, on the
other hand, Comic Relief grants
have paid for work with young
people who are homeless, or who
have problems with drugs and
alcohol, plus sheltered housing for
pensioners.
So, grab a nose, think of
something silly and come along to
this week's Rag meeting to find out
more. Failing all these, if you are
a resident of Falmouth Keogh you
can still have fun and support
Splatic Relief by joining the hall
party on Friday 12th, all proceeds
to Comic Relief. There will be
cocktails and casino, and entry is
free. What more could you desire?!

Now available from the R A G
Office! Entrance to the Royal
Albert Hall to watch Sting concerts
on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Friday and Saturday the week
beginning 7th March. There are
places for ten collectors each night,
although we can't actually
guarantee thateverybody will get in
to see the concert. Anyone that has
ever collected at the Proms will
know how easy it is, though -
just smile at the Stewards and you
can probably nab yourself a seat in
a doorway! All those eager people
who signed up at last week's
meeting will be given priority; can
these and anybody else wanting a
place please come along to the RAG
meeting this lunchtime at 1.10pm,
Union lounge.
Heave Ho
Do you want to break records AND
be on TV? Do you want to pull
three planes? Join the Greater
London Fund for the Blind in
pulling a jet, Concorde and a Jumbo
jet at three different airports on the
same day. A l l you need to do is
raise £250 sponsorship (or £500 if
you are a team of three) and collect
a form from the R A G office.
Next Saturday, the 13th of March,
sees yet another Rag Raid. This
time we will be joining Rags from
Exeter and Bristol universities in a
brave attempt to win a barrel of
beer.
The collection will be in aid of the
World Wildlife Fund for Nature
(W.W.F.), and will happen in
Bristol. The collection will take
place in - yes, you guessed it -
Bristol, and the barrel of beer will
be awarded to the Rag raising over
£1000. Food will almost certainly
be provided and the transport will
be free, so there are no excuses for
not going! Anybody interested in
getting away from the Big Smoke
for a day and winning a part-share
in a barrel of beer should either sign
up during the Rag meeting at
1:00pm today (Friday) or in the Rag
office at any time.
