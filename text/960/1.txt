Hononary Secretary Events and Returning Officer, Dominic Wilkinson experience Sabbatical Election hustings at St Mary's Hospital Medical School
by D S p o o n e r
Dominic Wilkinson, Honorary
Secretary Events said that some St
Mary's students weren't 'fit to lick
the shit off our shoes' after this
year's sabattical election hustings.
The hustings are an assembly and
an opportunity for the electorate to
see candidates identify their policies
in public performance. For the
purposes of Imperial College
Union, these events are staged at
locations within St Mary's in
Paddington, and Imperial College
in South Kensington. The St Mary's
hustings, coinciding with St Mary's
Union Rag Week activities, took
place on Tuesday evening at Wilson
House in Paddington.
After what initially appeared to
be high spirits on the part of the St
Mary's crowd, proceedings
continued with heckling the
candidates. The first of whom was
Presidential nominee Rachel
Mountford. Her proposer, Nicky
Fox, had been taken ill, so Miss
Mountford asked M r Steven
Newhouse to stand in and introduce
her. This he did and was summarily
flanned, as was Miss Mountford
herself.
Much political capital is made of
St Mary's legendary 'block vote',
with the more charismatic candidate
at the hustings generally being the
recipient of this en masse support.
Recent candidates to benefit from
this include Paul Shanley (President
1990-91) and the current President,
Mr Chris Davidson. However,
Miss Mountford, when addressing
this issue early on, was greeted with
jeers and shouts of 'What block
vote?'. Her opponent, M r Andrew
Wensley, appeared well adapted to
the prevailing atmosphere.
Hugh Eland, standing for Deputy
President, suffered from a distinct
amount of spoiling from the
audience. David Goddard, also
standing for Deputy President,
fared little better against the crowd,
with his proposer, Sarah McCarthy
receiving verbal sexual abuse from
some Mary's students present. The
only candidate for the position of
Honorary Secretary (Events),
Maxim Jalil, appearing to all but
lose his temper as he struggled
against the audience. By
comparison, the Felix Editor
candidates Ian Davies and Rebecca
Land were treated lightly.
The only person involved to
escape any barracking was Marc
Swan, St Mary's President. When
interviewed by i C N N afterwards,
Chairman of the hustings, Dominic
Wilkinson, said that it was a 'Farce,
fiasco, pointless, completely
contradictory to the point of a
hustings', adding that he intends to
write to the Dean of St Mary's,
Professor Peter Richards,
explaining what had occurred and
recommending that St Mary's are
never allowed to host a hustings
again.
By contrast, the Imperial College
campus hustings held in the Union
Building's Entertainments Lounge
yesterday evening were a largely
sober affair, with all candidates
being given every opportunity to
speak. One candidate even
proposed a minute's silence for
Bobby Moore. The highlights of
this event were the easy ride given
to Presidential candidates, and
conversely, the difficult time given
to Maxim Jalil, Ian Davies and
Rebecca Land by the questioners.
Dominic Wilkinson said later it was
'How a hustings should be run'.
