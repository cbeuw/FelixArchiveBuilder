I should have known it was going
to be a less than splendid night when
I had to charge back home for my
forgotten ticket, or when we then
missed the first act or when we got
the stupid idea of experimentally
sitting in the circle rather than
braving the masses below,
A band loitered onto the stage,
announced themselves, and casually
began to play. After one song I was
arguing as to whether they had said
'Hi, we are' or ' H i we are not'
Come. They were a big
disappointment. Their recently
released album was described by
critics as a 'striking painful debut'
and given full complements of stars
and marks out of ten, so I had
expected something special.

We had never been to 'Feet First'
before due to two things. 1) Mixed
Reports; everyone that liked it was
sad (although we hadn't quite
realised it at the time.) Everyone
that hated it had been to Equinox
and didn't see the funny side. 2) We
would have had to have paid to get
in. (BE A FELIX H A C K K I D S
-ED.)
So we get our little stickers from
the bouncer and head onwards and
upwards into 'Poddy Heaven' with
pens and pretensions sharply
poised. It's nearly ten o'clock.
Camden Palace is a converted
theatre from the Victorian era,
complete with balustrades, tasteless
sculpted integuments and dress
circle. (No longer enforced.)
Although there is a strict dress code
here - Long sleaved band placard,
half hearted long hair and Doctor
Marten's finest. God I felt old. The
kids, not a one without the teen
suffix, are all team players. There
is the Poppies crowd, the Neds
crowd, the Stuffies crowd (God
help us) and of course the ever so
sensitive Suede posse, all of whom
run on and off the dance floor to fly
their respective colours and throw
50p coins at the Ian Wrights of the
opposition.
One can only assume that pop is
dead when, having impressed the
Hacks by knowing all the lyrics to
the R A T M single ('Fuck you I
won't do what you tell me') -
The lyrics were completely
unintelligible, the singer managing
a kind of croaking shout and each
song packed three rhythm guitars
and little else. Very occasionally
they offered a glimpse of what I'd
hoped for, a more thoughtful,
depressive, anguished sound but it
was quickly taken over by the
relendess sameness of the music.
It's possible that the album and the
band do not transfer well to the live
arena, it's certain that this
performance wouldn't be anything
special on my hi-fi at home. On this
showing they get a haddock on the
fish scale.
For a couple of songs it was the
same story with Dinosaur Jr. I knew
it was them as soon as I saw J
Mascis doing his Captain Caveman
impression, a mass of hair eating a
microphone, but somehow I hoped
it wasn't. After a while they
switched guitars and albums, the
'Where are you?' material being the
more successful. Mascis' famous
solos were acceptable and supported
well by the thundering chord riffs
and we could even hear the words.
They're so lazy though, standing
around and obstinately ignoring the
audience, it's impossible to imagine
groups like this ever holding really
large concerts, though in many
ways that's a good thing.
I must admit that our awful location
above the crowd probably didn't
help their cause, everyone around
us lounging about sleepily when no
doubt the throng below were
feverishly hurling themselves
against the music to order. From
above it was more like watching the
commercials before a feature film.
I was genuinely shocked when I
heard hundreds of voices rise up to
us, singing 'Freak Scene', the final
song played. That, and a cover of
The Cure's 'Just like Heaven' apart,
everything was a little anti-
climactic. I never thought I'd
believe a grunge power trio could
miss its studio production but I did,
that and a smaller audience. Sadly,
not more than a pike on the fish
scale.
Owain.

released only a week before- they
immediately break into 'Where's
me piggin' Jumper ?' It's enough
to make you hang up you note book,
cry 'Endex' and break out the
carpet slippers.
Midnight, the situation
deteriorates, the band have not yet
arrived on stage, and some fifteen
year olds (female probably) are
smiling sweetly at us, Ralph
responds and is summarily punched
for his own sake.
Midnight thirty, Poddy arrives
avec photographic paraphernalia,
proceeds to float divinely several
feet above the Nirvana mosh to take
his rightful position on the
periphery of the stage for that
detailed close up.
Another ten minutes and TYS
finally grace us with their presence.
They are sublime in the truly
paradoxical sense. A very camp
bassist, the drummer, a flaxen
haired guitar combination (that
means more than one), I wannabe
wannabe wannabe Jim Morrison (or
is it Tim Booth ?... .Naah !) on the
lollopy vocals, and of course Albert
the click track.

Slavering their way out of Seatde's
undergrowth in their grumbling
metal dog-like way, a-howlin' an'
a-cursin' an' a-stiffin' the
opposition 'cos their licks are
harder, come Soundgarden, often
referred to as 'the Nirvana it's okay
to call the Black Sabbath it's
acceptable to think of as differendy
interesting'. M y , that's something
to live up to.
This 57 minutes of tour footage
(St Gavin gained fame when he
calculated this by measuring the
toenail, adding up the number of
hairs on the big toe, and multiplying
by 3.4126) comprises the beautiful
Chris Cornell permitting the camera
to examine him for traces of nasal
hair, the fuck-ugly Kim Thayil
cowering underneath his beard, and
some quite meaty moments from
'Badmotorfinger', including 'Rusty
Cage', 'Outshined', and 'Jesus
Christ Pose', but we kick off, and
it's quite a kick cherubs, with
'Searching with my good eye
closed'. It has moments when it's
quite literally good enough to make
a cup of coffee to, and sometimes
it fills you with a passion only a
toilet can quench, but when the
'Also Sprach Zarathustra' of 'Jesus
Christ Pose' comes on, it's time to
take off the short blond hairpiece
and let out those free-to-rock black
dreads that so many of you keep
covered up. Highlight of the
spectacle is Cornell's Dance of the
chafed inner thigh in his Angus
Young shorts and shots of all those
heavy metal gets in the audience
punching the air in a heavy metal
way. And amongst all this mayhem,
the question is begged; just how
green is your valley?
David
'God's P.45 ' is quite good, the
new single is nice, so are some of
the other songs. 'What's your level
?' (this is a song ?) is jolly good.
The Kids love it so much they jump
off the stage a lot. Poddy kicks one
for getting in into his viewfinder.
Thirty minutes of live 'indie pop',
enough to bring a smile to the face
of any already smiling person.
They've even got a cello in there for
a bit.
Meat may well be murder, but
veggies can't dance can they ?

Shelly is out to HA)
