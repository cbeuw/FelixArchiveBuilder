western culture would be
considered unacceptable.
In Japan it is illegal to gamble.
To get around this problem, the
Japanese have devised an interesting
method around this. Pachinko is
similar to the pinball machine,
except it involves a lot more balls!!
(Literally thousands.) Westerners
have never taken to this game due
to it being very noisy and illogical.
If a gambler wins he then exchanges
his balls for some prizes. He then
crosses over the street and trades his
prizes over for hard currency.
Pachinko is very popular in Japan,
and it is rare to see them empty in
the evening.
Another leisure activity is
'Karaoke'. This is the famous
nocturnal pastime where Japanese
have a chance to get intoxicated and
come out of their shells. Karaoke
is based on the traditional Japanese
'Enka' (traditional singing).
For the more active people
western sports are becoming more
popular. They are gradually
becoming more popular in schools
and as a pastime. However the two
national sports still remains to be
'Sumo' and 'Yakyu' (baseball).
A virtually universal pastime in
Japan is 'Manga' and 'Anime',
comics and animation. They range
from the extremely young to the
extremely adult topics. Japanese are
brought up on Manga from an early
age and it is not uncommon to see
old Japanese businessmen reading
Manga on the trains.
To conclude it can be said that
although traditional and modern
Japan are starkly different, the
traditional values are still carried
on. This is emphasised when one
travels from the countryside to the
modern inner city. We hope that
this article has given you an insight
into some of the many aspects of the
Japanese culture and gives a better
perspective of this country.
