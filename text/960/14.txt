Uncover the cocktail of cultures that makes up Singapore, only in Felix
In Singapore, you often hear the
expression, 'many races, one
people'. For while Singaporeans
have an innate sense of national
pride, they also have cultural roots
which stretch beyond the island
republic's borders to India,
Malaysia, China, even Portugal.
The traditions brought to
Singapore by its adventurous early
settlers did not wilt in foreign soil.
Instead, they flourished in a
supportive climate, with the result
that the fabric of Singapore's
society is woven from many multi-
cultural threads.
Singapore is renowned for its
year-round calendar of festivals
which bring additional colour and
life to this already bustling tropical
island. Just to mention a few, the
following are celebrated by the
various races, cultures and
religions.
The Dragon Boat Festival is
traditionally celebrated on the fifth
day of the fifth lunar month. In
Singapore, it has become an
international event with teams from
all over the world converging to
contest the world Invitational
Dragon Boat Race.
Dragon boat crews vie with one
another for line honours and
valuable prizes, in the colourful, and
noisy, spectacle that is enormously
popular with both spectators and
competitors alike.
On the water, the pounding of
drums and the chanting of crews fill
the air, while on land, the tempting
smells of steaming-hot rice
dumpjings and other traditional
seasonal delicacies distract
race-watchers.
The festival honours Qu Yuan, an
ancient Chinest poet who was a
loyal minister of state and became
most disturbed by the corruption
associated with court intrigues.
Deciding death was preferable to
dishonour, he clasped a large stone
to himself and jumped into the
river. Tradition has it that fishermen
desperately tried to save him,
thrashing the water with their oars
to drive off the fish and sea dragons
but their efforts were in vain.
On the anniversaries of his death,
rice was scattered into the water by
the townsfolk to feed Qu Yuan's
Haw Par Villa, a Chinese mythological theme park
Singapore's history is one of riches
and romance, spice trading and
piracy, colonialism and growth. In
the 7th century, she was Temasek,
the trading centre of Sumatra's
ancient Srivijaya empire.
By the 13th century, she had a
new name, Singapura, meaning
'Lion City'. The name came from
Sang Nila Utama, Prince of
Palembang, who reported seeing an
animal 'very swift and beautiful, its
body bright red, its head jet black.'
Clearly, the Prince was no
zoologist, for the beast was
probably a tiger. But he obviously
had a way with words, and the 13th
century name remains today.
A century later, Singapura
became the centre of a fierce
struggle between Java, Siam and the
Chinese led by Admiral Cheng Ho.
As is often the case in war, no clear
victor emerged and Singapore was
the main victim. Abandoned by the
fighting factions, its buildings were
reclaimed by the jungle, to stay
hidden until the 1800s.
Singapore was resettled in 1811
by 100 Malays, led by their local
chief, the Temmenggong. Eight
years later, Sir Stamford Raffles
stepped ashore on the banks of
Singapore River and decided that,
local pirates notwithstanding,
Singapore would be the ideal site
for the British trading base.
For 110 years Singapore boomed
with Raffles' vision of a free port
becoming reality and the island
becoming an Asian promised land
to many immigrants whose hard
work ensured their personal dreams
would come true.
In 1965, Singapore became an
independent republic. Over 28
years Singapore has relentlessly
pursued the goal of becoming
Asia's pre-eminant centre for
tourism, trade and finance, by
developing education and technical
training programmes, investment
strategies, aviation and
environmental policies.
Now the small island republic of
only 633 square kilometres, boasts
one of the world's busiest ports and
an airport served by over 50 of the
world's major airlines, serving
more than 11 million airline
passengers a year,
spirit. This has developed into the
rice dumpling which is an integral
part of the festival.
Haria Raya Puasa is the major
Muslim festival celebrated in
Singapore. It marks the end of the
fasting month of Ramadan, a time
of strict observances by Muslim
families.
Ramadan ends with special
prayers and the gathering of
families all over Singapore.
Dressed in new clothing, Muslims
everywhere celebrate with feasting
and visiting friends and relatives.
A celebration of good over evil,
Deepavali, or the Festival of Lights,
is especially significant to
Singapore's Indian community.
The triumph of light over dark is
reflected in the lighting of oil lamps
and coloured lights at homes.
