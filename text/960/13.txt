never played an important
international role again. It's
territory was artificially confined to
inside the Balkan peninsula (the
territories of Asia Minor are, today
still, part of Turkey and the more
remote Cyprus was refused its right
for unification with Greece in the
1950s). In the Balkans, Greece was
the main local power, until the drift
of the other countries of the area
towards communism, re-directed it
towards the West. Greece fought
with the Allies in the two World
Wars. It joined the E E C in 1979.
Greece has remained to a large
extent an agricultural country. Its
main financial resources though
come from tourism and from its
merchant fleet, the third most
important in the World. This
combination provides the Greeks of
this day with very comfortable
living standards, which, together
with the almost continuous sunshine
and mild climate, make for a most
pleasant life.
Modern-day famous Greeks
include poets like Nobel laureates
Seferis and Elytis (in line with
ancient tradition), musicians like
Maria Callas, Mitropoulos, the
half-Greek von Karajan and
Xenakis, and (less in line with
ancient tradition) tycoons like
Onassis.
Nigeria
Colourful, busy and varied, today's Nigeria by Nigerians students at IC
Nigeria is the most populous black
country in the world, and one of
every four Africans is Nigerian.
The country is roughly four times
the size of the United Kingdom and
is a melting pot of about 250
different languages and ethnic
groups with diverse social, cultural
and religious backgrounds.
Located on the south coast of
West Africa, Nigeria offers a rich
tableau of mangrove swamps,
rainforests, open woodlands and a
semi-desert environment in the far
north. The country consists of 30
states with Lagos as the commercial
capital city and a new administrative
capital city located at Abuja. At
present, each state is governed by
a democratically elected civilian
Governer, while a military
leadership co-existing with a
transitional civilian council run the
affairs of the country at the federal
level. However, a new
democratically elected civilian
president would assume office by
the end of the year.
Historically an agrarian country,
producing cocoa, tobacco, palm
products, cotton and peanuts,
Nigeria continues to thrive as an
agricultural country, but also has
abundant natural mineral resources
including some of the World's
largest reserves of crude oil which
accounts for 95% of her exports.
Furthermore, there has been a
substantial increase in the size and
activities of manufacturing
industries.
Home to the 'Yorubas,' 'Obos'
and Hausas' of this world and a host
of other ethnic minorities, Nigeria
vibrates with a cultural pulse which
dates back to as early as 700BC.
Advanced cultures developed
between the 12th and 14th century
in the Yoruba areas at Ife and in the
Hausa areas in the North. The
Northern part of Nigeria with its
groundnut pyramids and antique
mud houses with architecture
exhibiting a strong Arabic influence
provides breathtaking views as one
travels around the region. With
craftsmen using techniques passed
on by their forebears this offers
visitors the chance to purchase high
quality leather goods—souvenirs
that will be treasured for years.
Travel south of the river Niger and
visit places like Onitsha where you
find the largest open air market in
the world selling everything from
computers to Zebras—it sure beats
Harrods and is cheaper. Nearby is
Benin which is world famous for its
bronze and terracotta heads. Visit
Ife where the World is believed to
have come to birth and undergo a
new cultural experience.
