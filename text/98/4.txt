Whilst respecting the arguments of both schools
of thought i n the Middle East dispute, this
column takes no sides. We join the Rector i n
expressing our pleasure that the College d i d
not behave i n an irresponsible or h y s t e r i c a l
manner, as did other colleges during the c r i s i i
There were however exceptions. References
to these are found on page 2 under "Letters to
the E d i t o r " . Let the situation be approached
i n t h i s way. I f you took an active i n t e r e s t i n
a business concern you would take care not to
make p u b l i c , i n the name of the concern, your
views on any issue which had divided your
c l i e n t e l e . You would not wish to lose h a l f of
them. In addition, your business colleagues
might not hold your opinions. They would be
most displeased, f o r you would have used t h e i r
name as well as your own. Consider these two

RECTOR'S GIFT.
The Rector has presented the Union with
four college c r e s t s , which w i l l be displayed
somewhere i n the new b u i l d i n g , probably i n
the bar. The crests are made of metal and
are duplicates of those c a r r i e d by the College
Marshals on Commemoration Day. They w i l l be
presented by the Rector to the President of the
Union at H a l l Dinner on November 20th.
HALL DINNER.
H a l l Dinner w i l l continue on Tuesdays i n the
New Union u n t i l December l l t h . On December 18th.
the Christmas H a l l Dinner (formal dress ) w i l l be
held i n Ayrton H a l l , where the Choir w i l l sing
grace and carols. A l l members of the Union
may attend H a l l Dinner which i s handsomely
subsidised from college funds. Bookings i n the

HARLINGTON.
The A t h l e t i c Ground CommitteeHjhas high hopes
that the bar and tea rooms w i l l acquire new
f u r n i t u r e soon. The r i c k e t y tea tables and
poor q u a l i t y chairs and forms are a disgrace to
the college. I t i s also hoped to obtain more
occasional tables and easy chairs to convert
the room next to the bar into a bar only, with
a l l teas provided i n the large tea room only.
The sooner the better.
