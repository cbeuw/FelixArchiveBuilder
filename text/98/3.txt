him* J t is** Juat that ha d i d not play f o o t b a l l
or c r i c k e t a a i ha was not aa active supporter
of M s houwa. T a l l , pala and bespectacled, the
bookish Smith was consistently suecesful i n
examinations, t h i s was not because he was
•ore c l e v e r than h i s aore rumbustious fallows
but because he enjoyed two hours of extra
study rather than attempting to play i n a
game of f o o t b a l l . On the rare occasions when
he waft I n v i t e d to p a r t i e s , he f a i l e d miserably
to Imitate the boisterous s p i r i t s of h i s
f r i e n d s , making rather a f o o l of himself. But
he would sparkle i n h i s c l a s s , answering d i f -
f i c u l t questions with a glow of personal s a t -
i s f a c t i o n .
Hubert won a scholarship to Imperial C o l -
lege, and i t i s not s u r p r i s i n g that he had
rather an exaggerated opinion of himself. At
I.C. l i f e was f i n e . Hubert's lodgings i n
Baling were very comfortable and the four
chape who were also staying there were of l i k e
• i n d . Apart from a v i s i t to the cinema on
Saturday nights they a l l worked very hard. How
i t was that others i n his year were able to
spend so much time on rowing and rugby, dram-
a t i c s and dancing, chess, bridge, Union meet-
ings and other a c t i v i t i e s , Hubert could never
quite fathom.
The turning point i n Hubert's career at
I.C. was a shames meeting with an Enlighten-
ed Administrator, t h i s gentleman took a l i k i n g
to Hubert and saw that he was not obtaining
the f u l l value from h i s stay at U n i v e r s i t y . The
B.A. found Hubert a place i n an Imperial C o l -
lege Hostel where he soon came i n to contact
with c o l l e g e l i f e . Because he no longer had
his d a l l y task to and from Outer London, he
found that he had time to meet these new i n -
fluences h%lf-way.
A year l a t e r found a d i f f e r e n t H.B. Smith.
He had found new confidence i n himself. Thor-
oughly accepted by those who professed a d i s -
l i k e f o r the kind he had been, he joined i n
many Union a c t i v i t i e s . He sat on committees
and had a reputation f o r being a man who could
be depended upon to a s s i s t with the organisat-
ion of Onion functions. Looking back, Hubert
found that a l l t h i s had not had a detrimental
e f f e c t on h i s work. I t had given him a d i f -
ferent a t t i t u d e to i t , but i t had not a f f e c t -
ed i t s q u a l i t y .
Unfortunately, the four who had shared l o d
glngs i n B a l i n g with Hubert were not as lucky.
The Bnlightened Administrator eould not f i n d
hostel places f o r the* as wall - there are so
f a * places f o r so many people. Hubert found
i t d i f f i c u l t to persuade them to turn away
from t h e i r drab habits. As f a r as we know
they, hawing graduated, s t i l l lead a humdrum
l i f e l a i n f e r i o r Jobs and are a very poor
advertlseaerrt tor the c o l l e g e .
Harlington Hop
The Guy Fawkes' hop at Harlington was very well
supported this year. Judging by the queues for tickets,
these could have been sold twice over.
Bases started leaving the Union at 6.45 without
the usual fireworks display in and around them. On
arrival at Harlington one found the hall pleasantly
decorated and the three bars pleasantly stocked.
Outside there was a massive wood-pile, later to provide
a first-class bonfire.
The dancing was soon in f u l l swing, the selection
«f rook 'n' r o l l reoards proving very popular. In spite
of a 50-50 sale of tickets, the unaccompanied males had
a lean time. It appeared that most drowned their sorrow
in drink. The large enamel jugs, holding over a gallon
of beer each, were frequently being filled.

r 5th Celebrations
The time-honoured ploy:"Shall we go and see the bonfire?"
was to be heard everywhere at about 9 p.m., and soon a
large crowd congregated around the inferno. The buses
provided a favourite vantage point from whioh to view the
proceedings altheagh attention soon shifted to way out
on the rugby pitches where the fireworks got away to a
rocketing start. The lapses between the individual dis-
plays were not, however, well received. There were fewer
fireworks than in previous years and a set piece, some-
what inappropriately called "Zambesi Falls" rounded off
the show.
Back i n the warmth of the pavilion the word soon
spread that hot-dogs were being given away. Almost a
riot ensued. The Skiffle Group provided a suitable
diversion and soon gathered a large crowd,who at times
almost became "hep".
As scam as -she reoards came an again everyone wher
oould find a partner started dancing. The excess of
males was inoresed by the influx of certain undesirable-
looking Harlington locals. The dance came to an end
surprisingly soon - altough the fun was not yet over.
Few of the buses reached South Kensington with a f u l l
oemfCbn>ent of light, due to the removal of the bulbs by
seme poor sea starved XJS, men. However, the evening as
at whole had-helped to alleviate that situation. Every-
one agreed that i t was good value for money.
