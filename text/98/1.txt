GUILD'S „/ LORD
MAYOR'S SHOW
Guilds had the h u m i l i a t i n g experience this
/ e a r of seeing t h e i r r i g h t f u l place i n the
Lord Mayor's Show usurped by the unworthy rep-
resentatives of King's, due to a p r i z e piece
of bungling by some Incompetent C i t y administr-
ator.
The i n v i t a t i o n to Guilds to take part i n
the procession was sent by mistake^to King's
College, a small|co-education seminary near
Charing Cross. That someone should confuse
t h i s place with Guilds shows just how l a c k i n g
i n education are those who "do something i n the
c i t y " .
The s c u r r i l o u s leaders of the King's mob
decided to keep t h i s i n v i t a t i o n and by the time
the mistake had been discovered i t was stated
by the organisers of the procession to be too
l a t e to make any changes. So Guilds were a l -
lowed to man only two f l o a t s . These facts were
explained by John Hart on Thursday to a crowded
Onion M e t i n g . The meeting was a l s o told that
a h a l f - h o l i d a y had been granted f o r the occaslei
and plans could be made for a r e p r i s a l r a i d on
Kings a f t e r the procession.
On Friday morning a large number of Guilds-
men made t h e i r way down to the City and con-
gregated at the corner of Ludgate H i l l and Old
B a i l e y . Thanks to strenuous work by Keith Duck-
worth and a few stalwarts from the motor club,
Bo was on the road again by Friday and althougfe
she could not take part i n the procession was
proudly taken along to see the show. This i n
s p i t e of "dropping i n a valve" on the way. As
i s usual on such occasions, Bo i t s e l f was a
big a t t r a c t i o n .
As the various King's College f l o a t s appear-
ed down Ludgate H i l l and passed the Massed
fYnllasmen, the dubious nature of t h e i r parentage
was f r e e l y advertised. Many other King's fallimga
were explained to bystanders and policemen. The
l a t t e r , i n p a r t i c u l a r , obviously appreciated
the bandinage and were very good-humoured and
eo-operatlve throughout the proceedings.
Once the procession had passed, Guilds turn-
ed t h e i r attention to more serious business,
end, l e d by John Bart i n Bo. swept along the
Enbsnkncnt up to the gates of K.C. They were
t o l d by the p o l i c e that Bo could not stay, so
the President discounted and l e d the b a t t l e on
foot while Be returned to South Kensington.

MORPHY DAY
(STOP PRE5S)
The turnout, from Guilds and Mines for Morphy/ Day
on Wednesday was the smallest for some years. Despite
a twisted orank-shaft Bo was eventually coaxed to l i f e
and left S. "Ken. with John Hart, the Spanner, and the
two ladies of Guilds as passengers Jezebel fresh from
her christening the day before roared down to Putney
in fine style.
The main party went by the well triad District
line. A small incident occured at Parsons Green, when
some members of E.C.S. took charge of an unwanted t a i l
lamp lying on the platform. This was angrily demanded
back by a member of the L.T. and the train was held up
for lOmins. while a futile search of the carriages was
made. This train only continued after most of the
Guilds people had been forced to disembark and make
their way to Putney an foot.
While waiting for the llorphy boats to come out a
lot of good-humoured ragging went on in front of the
boat house and there were one or two determined eff-
orts by both R.C.S. and Mines to capture the Spanner.
These were unsuccessful however, unless one counts the
small chunk of wood brutally torn from one end.
The Miners had as their masoot two hydrogen filled
balloons. These were anchored to a lamp-post but 3oon
released by Guildsmen on the ro"f of the Boat-house.
Just before the i.lorphy crews came out the new Boat
Club launch 'Menelaus' was christened with Kerrydown
Cider by Mrs. Lowry from the bank. 1
Menelaus'cost £850
is powered by a 20h.p. twin cylinder outboard motor
and i s capable of 22 Knot3. The Rector and his wife
and Col. Lowry, Clerk to the Governors, and Mrs. Lowry
watched the races from 'Menelaus1
.
Between the Morphy and Lowry Races there was more
ragging ( s t i l l not a policeman in sight) and three
gentlemen were seen with a l l or most of their trousers
missing. The return to I.C. was made en masse. Gains:
Okie bus stop - Losses: One budding scientist (miss-
ing, presumed arrested).
