L Cup
I.C. drew U.C. i n the f i r s t rounci of the
U.L. Cup, and thus l a s t years Cup F i n a l (which
I.C. won 6-0) was v i r t u a l l y repeated. Unfort-
unatly the r e s u l t was not so happy, U.C. winning
8-3. One can only say that U.C. were s l i g h t l y
superior i n every department of the game and
thoroughly deserved to win. As I.C. have won the
cup four times i n f i v e years no one w i l l begrudge
U.C. t h e i r v i c t o r y , e s p e c i a l l y as they have had
to endure the f r u s t r a t i o n of being beaten f i n -
a l i s t s two years running.
I.C. were unlucky i n that Ray Stone, who has
been the mainspring of the attack t h i s season,
was crocked on the previous Saturday. Also
Brian Hearn was playing under the handicap of
an i n j u r e d neck, and has since been advised to
rest f o r another month. It was hardly s u r p r i s -
ing that he d i d not show h i s form of l a s t year,
although he almost kicked two long penalties
which would have snatched an undeserving win
for I.C. However U.C. were superior i n the
forwards and would probably have won anyway.
I.C. must now concentrate on b u i l d i n g up
a strong side for t h e i r Easter tour i n Cornwall.
To win one or more matches against such form-
idable opposition would be a much greater ach-
ievement than* another Cup win.
B o x i n g Club J
The U.L. boxing t r i a l s which were fought
as an Inter-College competition for the B l o t t
Cup, were held i n the U.L. gym on Thursday
November l s t . The team from I.C. was M.Garvey,
S.Jackson, L. Palmer, G.Halsey, J.Baker, the
l a s t three named being winners of t h e i r weights.
Once the new I.C. gym i s a v a i l a b l e , the club
should be confident of a good season.

THE TWO RACES
M0HPH3C: Mines took the Surrey, R.C.S. the centre, and
Guilds the Middlesex stations. This year the course
was slightly shorter than previously and the start was
a line taken from the first flight o i steps on the S.
bank and the second 'Warning' notice on the N. bank an
the Putney side of Hammersmith Bridge.
Positions and times were as follows:
(Mines = M; Guilds = G, and Jl.C.S. = R)

The Guilds, cox was more clever than the Mines cox and .
this difference was probably worth a length to the C.
& G» boat. Fearing a cross-wind which blew strongly at
the start, Bumby took an unnecessarily wide sweep an
the bend. The race was a fairly fast one but the strok-
ing for the greater part of the race was between 28
and 30.
LOWRY: The wind seemed stronger during this second
race whioh started at the milepost. Guilds took
the centre, R.C.S. the Middlesex, and Mines the Surrey
stations. Guilds drew ahead right from the start, with
their co^ steering a rather zig-zag course. Whether or
not this was intentional, i t served to confuse the
other ooxes. Guilds maintained their lead and went on-
to beat R.C.S. by 2 lengths in 4m 20s. Mines lagged
unexpectedly right from the start, finishing 2 lengths
behind R.C.S.
H O C K E Y
After l o s i n g 4-0 to Ashford on the prev-
ious Saturday, I.e. v i s i t e d U.C. on Wed. Oct.
31st.and gained a 2-1 win. Both the goals re-
sulted from keen following up ir.to the c i c l e ,
suited from keen following up into the c i r c l e ,
a practice which should be continued. The 4-1
defeat by Vickers-Armstrong on the following
Sat. would have been much l i g h t e r had I.C. sh-
own more s p i r i t In the forward l i n e and coop-
eration i n the defending c i r c l e as they had
almost h a l f the play. On Nov.7th. the U.L. cup
match against Chelsea Poly, at MItcham r e s u l t e d
i n a 4-1 win for I.C. who f i e l d e d a side which
included four U.L. players. On the whole the
team gave a promising display although against
better teams i t w i l l be necessary to r e s t r i c t
some of the free-lance t a c t i c s used with f a i r
success i n t h i s game.
