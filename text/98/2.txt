Bear S i r ,
A p e t i t i o n has been c i r c u l a t e d i n the c o l -
lege deploring the Government's action i n the
Middle Eastern c r i s i s . Also, a group of people
took part In the anti-Government demonstrations
i n Trafalgar Square carrying a placard bearing
the slogan: "Imperial College Students r e -
pudiate 19th. Century i B p e r i a l l s a " .
Many signatories to the p e t i t i o n gave t h e i r
address as this c o l l e g e ! the name of the college;
was dragged i n t o p o l i t i c s . This, concerns us a l l .
Imperial College i s i n a p a r t i c u l a r l y not-
iceable and vulnerable p o s i t i o n because the
public are spending money on i t s expansion.
The expansion i s f o r the good of the country,
not ourselves. I t needs the goodwill of the
nation and government. In addition, i f we wish
to maintain our p o s i t i o n as one of the most im-
portant colleges i n England and indeed, i n the
World i t i s e s s e n t i a l that our opinions should
be respected and that we should not undermine
our own prestige.
In the meantime, and i n any future c r i s i s ,
I hope that members of t h i s college w i l l behave
more responsibly. Otherwise, I hope that they
w i l l d i s s o c i a t e themselves e n t i r e l y from the
college and the Union.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
D.J. Hlgson.
(In a telephone conversation with the M i t o r
on Sunday, Mr. Bigson said that he wished to
make i t quite c l e a r that he would have been
equally concerned had the actions he has
c r i t i c i s e d been pro-Bden. I t i s the p o l i t i c s
and not the sentiments to which he objects.)

Dear Sir,
Daring the last few days the Press has giv-
en prominence to a number of meetings organised by
the students of the University of London expressing
concern over Hungary and Suez.
Without exception these meetings have been in-
adequately publicised on the notice boards of Imperial
College, and consequently poorly supported by members
of this College.
Whilst i t must be accepted that demonstrations of
the Whitehall variety are not the best way of express-
ing our misgivings, i t would be unfortunate i f this
College was thought to be apathetic.
Tours etc.,

Dear Sir,
While the facts are s t i l l somewhat obscure
i t does seem that something could have been done
earlier about Guilds representation in the Lord May-
or1
s Show.
Could we have a luoid explanation from the Union
of this matter and of the non-appearance of Bo in
the Brighton Rally?
Apathy or Incompetence?

The following letter was received by the Chair-
man of the I.C.Entertainment Committee from a young
lady who had attended one of the I.C. informal danoes.
Dear Sir,
After attending one of your Sat. evening hops,
we would like to comment an the fact that many of
the boys attending do not danoe, but merely decorate
the walls especially near the door.
No g i r l likes being a wall-flower, and we are
even mare surprised that the boys like being pansies.
We feel that these hops would be a great success
i f only everyone would dance, and i f tnfe'boys do
not intend to danoe, they should not come.
Yours Sincerely,
"A Hopeful Wall-flower".

Lord Mayor's Show.
continued from page one
A small party managed to enter by the rear
entrance and after overpowering the porter open-
ed the main Strand gate to l e t i n the main body
of Guildsmen. John Hart called out for the Pres-
ident of Kings i n order to demand an apology
f o r his dtubious part i n the conspiracy to keep
Guilds out of the Show. Unfortunately the gentle-
man did not appear so Guilds went into the main
h a l l and rent the a i r with a 'Boomalaka'. As the
l a s t echoes of this died away a stream of l i q u i d
poured down on them from a fire-extinguisher.
There followed a general melee with students
of Kings, i n which further fire-extinguishers
were used to great effect, and Guilds then with-
drew through the main gates. Here the p o l i c e were
holding back an angry mob of Kings who had just
returned from the Show.
Altogether the Lord Mayor's Show Day of 1956
w i l l remain a memorable one and we are informed
that Guilds have already taken steps to ensure
that next year they w i l l once more take t h e i r
proper place i n the Procession.
