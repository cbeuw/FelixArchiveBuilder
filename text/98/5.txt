of only one shilling, inclusive of transport, was
Bat what i n fast happened? On both days that
tickets were ea sale, a l l the sen's tickets and
nearly a l l the women's tickets were sold i n a matter
of minutes. This Indicated the willingness of the
students to oamply with the wishes of the authorities.
However, for many of the hundreds of students unable
to gat Harlington tickets, the attitude of the Uni-
versity Senate and the Metropolitan Police made i t
vary difficult to celebrate Guy Pawkes' Day i n the
traditional manner.
The present position i s thus most unsatisfac-
tory. Two things might be done to improve i t . First,
more sites far students' Nov. 5th activities must be
found. One solution for those who would like a
procession of the type now banned by the Metropolitan|
Police, may be to arrange a river pageant on the
Thames. Bargee, merrymakers, raft-borne bonfire and
a l l would proceed down river to where a danoe or
carnival may be held. Provided folks refrain from
shooting pedestrians off Bridges with rockets, the
police can have no reaj. objection to such a function,
whioh would doubtless be welcomed by the general
public
Second, with respect to rags in general, the
Senate should give an undertaking that disciplinary
action would be taken only i f there has been damage
to person or property. This i s fair to students and
i s enough to dtseawas* the wrong type% of rag.
To finish, I would like to put a sincere
question, to the College and university Authorities.
It has been said i n the past that students consider
themselves a privileged class. They could "get away"''
with anything during rags. Some students may have
held this view, but who can say we are privileged
when the Senate has the power of imposing a second
punishment after a student has already been dealt
with in a court of Justice?

8BLKIKK CARRIES THE BANNER. Four
residents of S e l k i r k H a l l accident-
a l l y found themselves c a r r y i n g a
placard at the head of a alien*,
protest march. The National Press
depicted these stalwarts conducting
t h e i r responsible task with f o r t i t u d e
and solemnity.
ANYTHING FOR A RAO. I t was unfortunate
that the organisers of the above
procession f a i l e d to foresee that
e a r l y d i s p e r s a l of the students would

was obvious from the large number
of explosive pyrotechnics dlmcaarged
and the fact that certafl* Students

U. L. UNION MEETINGS Laot year a l l
the Union General Meetings were found
to be inquorate and adjourned. One
hundred Union members, representing
two t h i r d s of the Colleges of the
U n i v e r s i t y form the quorum.
At the Meeting l a s t week, Just
over 100 members of the Union were
present, (10 from I.C.) but only 19
of the 43 colleges were represented.
As a r e s u l t motions on Red Cross
r e l i e f and the United Nations were
not discussed.
More i n t e r e s t i n Union p o l i c y
must be shown by a l l members of the
U n i v e r s i t y i n order to get a l i v e l y
Union run by the majority.
BLOCS VOTES At the U.L.U.A.G.M.,

House Committee revealed a great
degree of i n t e r - c o l l e g e allegiance.
