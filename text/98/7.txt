'fresher eights' a l l of whom are going well

On F r i . Nov. 2nd. eight of the more exper-
ienced members o f the club went to the Llanbe-
r i s P a s s , North Wales f o r the week-end.
The monotony of the long drive ended as we
approached Bettws-y-Coed. The well known mount-
ains were beginning to r i s e over the f o o t h i l l s
and already the party was planning the week-end
ahead.
The L l a n b e r i s Pass i s a steep sided valley
which separates Snowdoti from the Glyders. On
the walls of this v a l l e y there are many steep
c l i f f s and buttresses with terraced tops giv-
ing r i s e to climbs of a d i f f i c u l t or severe
nature. Among the climbs done wereOrackstone
Rib, the Cracks, Pharoes Wall and many others
at or above severe standard.
On Saturday evening, four members spent
three very enjoyable hours at the Pen-y-Gwyrd
Hotel. They were lucky enough to get a l i f t
back to the camp four miles away.
Like Saturday, Sunday dawned misty and the
grey c l i f f s looked very foreboding. Towards
the afternoon the misty walls of the valley
closed i n and i t started to d r i z z l e . The whole
v a l l e y was s i l e n t now except f o r the distant
rush of a stream and the urgent roar of a P r i -
mus making the l a s t cup of tea.
If the week-end i s to be judged on climb-
ing standards alone, i t was probably one of
the best meets the club has ever held. More
than t h i s , every member enjoyed himself to the
f u l l , the only regret being the shortness of
the stay.
