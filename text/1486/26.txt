Finding a house
You’ll be required to pay
some fees before you’re al-
lowed to move in, expect some-
thing similar to the following:
Holding Deposit
If you like the place, this is
what you pay the estate agent
to take it off the market for you.
Usually a weeks rent – £120.
Security Deposit
Usually equal to 6 weeks rent,
£720 that you get back at the
end. Make sure that you keep
the house clean and everything
is kept in good order and there
won’t be a problem. The Stu-
dent Accommodation Centre
have a lot of advice on this,
which can be found on their
section of the college website.
First Month’s Rent
If you don’t have a UK based
guarantor they may ask for up
to the first 6 months upfront. If
the agent does this, Accommo-
dation services recommends
haggling if need be. The agent
may not budge on this but it
doesn’t hurt to try – £530
Admin Fee
You’ll pay this if you go through
an estate agent, which is usu-
ally sensible, to be honest. Can
be anything between £100 to
£250, and may be rolled in with
your holding deposit as one
payment. Some agents have
special arrangements with Im-
perial to waive this fee, more
information can be gained from
the Student Hub.

How much could you pay in fees
Bills
As always, common sense
is the order of the day. It’s
easy to keep putting it off, but
to avoid getting unexpected
humungous bills at the end of
the year (or visits from bailiffs)
sort out your utilities (water,
gas, electricity, phone line)
as soon as you move in. In
terms of paying if you’re shar-
ing a house, provided every-
one agrees how they are going
to split it and roughly when
they’re expected to pay it,
things should pass off without
a hitch. Joint accounts can be
a great way of sorting this out
if everyone has a set direct
debit to it each month to keep
it all ticking over, although
setting these up and closing
them at the end can be a faff,
especially with large numbers
of flatmates.
Your Landlord... Dun dun dun!
Depending on the type of
contract that you have,
you’ll spend more or less time
dealing with your landlord. Ob-
viously you are going to want
to have as friendly a relation-
ship with him or her as pos-
sible. Remember that you’re
landlord cannot simply turn up.
They have to give at least 24
hours notice. But if they do vis-
it, ensure that you tidy the
house in advance,
don’t needlessly
aggravate them.
Your landlord is
responsible for
reasonably main-
taining the prop-
erty. Notify your
landlord if there
any problems
with your prop-
erty, such as
blocked sinks. Keep a record
of all your communication.
An obvious one: pay your
rent on time, every time.
Finally, be good to your
neighbours, chances are
they’ll complain to your land-
lord if you keep them up all
night partying.
