What to think about whe
Housing is arguably the most important par
As with most important decisions in life, mistakes get made. But whe
an intrepid bunch of mates from your corridor or are an old hand who
while they sleep it’s important to remember the help and information
You may not find a group of
people that are right for you.
Don’t sweat it. Living alone
lets you get more work done
and avoids the issue of find-
ing that your friends are less
enjoyable when you live with
them. The main cons are the
increased cost (you have to
pay your bills all by yourself)
and the solitude. However, if
you’re a person who values
their space, the solitude could
be a plus! Don’t rule out living
alone as an option.
T
here are few general
rules about this as
every person you
can live with will be
different. That said,
if you have any doubts about
any of your prospective flat-
mates it’s best to get it all out
in the open before you become
a legally combined entity on
a tenancy contract. The most
common type of contract al-
lows your flatmates to leave
and burden the rest of you with
the shortfall in rent so don’t be
complacent about working on
personal relationships in your
house.
Living Arrangements
Living alone
The general rule is that if you
live with loads of people and
don’t think that any of them
is a complete disgusting slob,
it’s probably you. If you are wor-
ried that this is this case, then
living in a house with only one
other person is the best way to
go. Mostly because it is easy
to distinguish whose mess is
whose, and it is harder to hide
behind the excuse that it’s
someone else’s turn to tidy up.
Don’t ignore the fact that your
untidiness can have a real im-
pact on your friendships, even
with your closest friends, so do
make an effort. Cleaning rotas
can be helpful to make sure
everyone does their fair share.
Dealing with messy housemates
Have you got a two-bed flat?
And a flatmate who’s like,
totally in love with this girl?
What are you going to do when
he asks you one day whether
it’s cool if she moves in with
him. Are you happy with that?
Ashton, a final year Materials
student who said yes tells Fe-
lix, “I knew both of them well
before they were going out,”.
He stresses that, as with all
housing situations, it depends
upon their personalities. Oc-
casionally arguments happen
(as with anyone), but that
“happens even if you don’t
live with a couple, and they’re
probably being even more
careful about how much I’m
involved.” He went on to say
that it was, “probably the best
living arrangement [he’d] had
at university.”
What is it like living with a couple?
The sure fire way to save on
rent is to share a one bed flat
with someone you love, or hell,
if you’re free and easy, share a
one bed flat with several peo-
ple you love (Felix doesn’t rec-
ommend this). This can also
be very good for your relation-
ship; it will either bring you in-
credibly close together or very
quickly let you know that it’s
not meant to be. However it’s
important to remember that
finding out your true feelings
for your better half and com-
plying with a legal obligation
to pay rent for a set period
of time can conflict with each
other if things go south in a
bad way. Fernanda, an Impe-
rial student who found herself
in this situation warned, “We
moved in and started mak-
ing less of an effort to see
each other, and then the argu-
ments started and we would
say things we didn’t mean
but couldn’t take back.” Still
though she doesn’t want to
put anyone thinking about it:
“I still think it was good, and
it was especially useful in the
long run.” There are many suc-
cess stories as well, Kat. a
postgrad in Nat Sci who has
been living with her boyfriend
since they met in Beit says
“we realised we would live well
together in halls in first year
and have been living together
ever since. It is good for sav-
ing money as you only need
one room and, if you listen
to each other and give each
other space when necessary,
it can be the perfect living
arrangement.”
