Strut Our Science: fashion with a twist
With the increasing role of technology in the innovation of fabrics and design,
Imperial showcases some of the best examples in the field: Mithila Patkunan reports

ollowing WSET’s (Women
in Science, Engineering and
Technology) success of pre-
vious years with celebrat-
ing International Women’s
Day with the 100Women100Visions
Project, We.Are.Science Photography
Competition and Exhibition of Women
in Science, they held: Strut Our Science.
This was a celebration of the science
and technology that is increasingly in-
volved in the fashion industry, with Im-
perial College’s female students taking
the stage. With the recent success of the
Spray-On Fabric developed at Imperial,
it seems fitting to explore the role of sci-
ence in fashion.
The show featured the finalists for a
competition WSET had been running
on campus for students to re-style the
high visibility jacket. Alongside this
there was a parade of ‘high-tech’ wear
including Super Fibre, metal threading,
laser-cutting, self-cleaning & much
more. The WSET team worked with
students from the Materials department
to create microscopic images and learn
the scientific backgrounds of the mate-
rials they used.
The team was joined by inspirational
fashion designer Britt Lintner. She pre-
viously held a leading role in the world
of finance, but left to launch her epon-
ymous label. This was a response to a
fashion market wholly unsuited to her
needs as an executive woman.
The show was held in the prime lo-
cation of Imperial’s Main Entrance,
attracting a great crowd, including the
male students!
Featured garments were then exhib-
ited for the rest of the week in the main
entrance. This event was sponsored by
RBS and IBM.
The student society WSET is about
promoting the SET courses to more
girls and helping the existing Imperial
students into continuing into industry or
academia.
They hold open days for school girls
during the year and CV and Networking.
sessions for students.
