Medics’ union
faces £40,000
funding cut
Imperial College School of Medicine
Students’ Union (ICSMSU) is facing a
£40,000 cut to its funding, as Imperial
College Healthcare Charity withdraws
its support over the next 5 years, with
a 20% reduction each year. This will
be especially detrimental to the elec-
tives fund and ICSM Gazette. ICSMSU
President, David Smith, is confident that
the Union will acquire self-sufficiency
with more alumni support in the next
five to six years. According to the only

A College committee is working on
proposals to increase Imperial’s bursary
provision that could see more students
receiving financial aid. The proposals
from the Fees and Financial Aid Work-
ing Group would see students from fam-
ilies earning £60,000 receiving bursaries
(up from the current £50,000), while the
amount being paid kept constant, if not
increased. The news comes as Imperial
College Union announced the results of
the Bursaries Survey, showing that stu-
dents valued financial aid during univer-
sity above tuition fee reductions.
The results of the survey highlighted
a clear discrepancy between govern-
ment efforts to force universities to offer
tuition fee waivers and the demands of
Imperial students.
