Campus. For over twelve years now, he
has been studying roundabouts in Brack-
nell, treating the roundabouts like small
islands of green in a sea of tarmac and
concrete. Dr Leather had this to say on
the subject: “At the beginning, I started
looking at roundabouts as purely an aca-
demic exercise, but I soon realised that it
was a great way of getting people inter-
ested in Urban Ecology. There is a huge
abundance of wildlife which thrives on
roundabouts; I like to think of them as
urban nature reserves”.
Dr Leather is somewhat sceptical
about the extent to which green spaces
in cities and ideas such as vertical gar-
dens and skyscraper farms can help re-
duce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.
He argues that, although most of the
world’s population now lives in urban
areas, the actual area our towns and cit-
ies take up on the globe is still relatively
small. As such, Dr Leather believes that
green areas in cities are unlikely to ever
make a significant impact in reducing
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. In-
stead, he argues: “Green spaces in urban
areas are much more about mitigating
the effects of climate change, rather than
tackling its causes. Large green spaces
in cities can actually help reduce the
temperature a small amount.” According
to Dr Leather, the two main benefits of
green spaces in urban areas are undoubt-
edly preserving biodiversity and reduc-
ing flood risk: “People are constantly
tarmacking over their gardens so they
have a place to park their cars and this
leads to significantly reduced run-off
times when it rains. Maintaining green
spaces can help us avoid this problem”.
However, the benefits of urban ecolo-
gy don’t end here. Dr Leather argues that
green spaces can also have a massive af-
fect on human psychology: “Trees can
make you feel calm and peaceful; re-
search has shown that people who drive
to work along streets lined with trees
tend to arrive at work in a happier frame
of mind than those who drive to work
along streets without any greenery”. In
addition, the ability of trees to improve
our mood manifests itself in economic
terms: “If you have two similar streets,
one with trees on it and one without, the
houses on the streets with trees are likely
to be worth significantly more”.
The effects of urban ecology on our
human psychology is a subject which
Professor Nigel Bell of the Impe-
rial College Centre for Environmental
Policy has also looked into closely. He
says: “green spaces are certainly good
for people’s mental well-being; it has
been shown that giving hospital patients
a view of green space from their win-
dow can actually improve their chances
of recovery”.
However, Professor Bell’s main area
of interest is air pollution. Air pollution
causes around 4,500 premature deaths
in London each year. Professor Bell has
published a number of papers on how
air pollutants, produced by cars and
industry affect our urban ecology. He
believes: “London probably has more
green space than any other city in Eu-
rope; it’s really important that we have
this vegetation to help filter out these air
pollutants”.
In 1993, Professor Bell chaired a re-
view group on urban environmental
science. In a report which Professor
Bell himself describes as “pretty dam-
ming”, he argues: “Over 90% of British
people live in towns and cities, yet the
government has no department directly
responsible for urban areas – this seems
ludicrous to me”.
Yet, Professor Bell isn’t just con-
cerned with urban ecology in London,
or even just in the UK. He has also
looked at the effects of air pollution
in cities in India, including Delhi and
Varanasi. He argues that this is a huge
problem which needs to be tackled:
“Air pollution has a major effect on ur-
ban agriculture, it dramatically reduces
yields. But this problem is not even
recognised by the Indian government”.
According to Professor Bell, it is main-
ly people who have small subsistence
farms in these urban areas who suffer
as a result. As with many of the issues
surrounding urban pollution, he argues:
“it is once again the poorest of the poor
who end up suffering most”.
Thus, our ability to protect urban ecol-
ogy is not only of paramount importance
for protecting plant and animal biodiver-
sity, it also plays a vital role in improv-
ing the quality of our lives too.
Guerrilla
Gardening
What the hell is ‘guerrilla gar-
dening’? Although the term was
first coined in New York in the
seventies, ‘guerrilla gardeners’
have actually been active in
the UK since the 17th century.
Put simply, ‘guerrilla gardeners’
are people who garden other
people’s land without permis-
sion. The motivations for doing
this can be diverse: the ‘guerril-
las’ may simply be gardening to
improve the aesthetic qualities
of land neglected by its legal
owner, or it may be politically
motivated. Either way, ‘guerrilla
gardening’ is usually kept top
secret and is often carried out
under the cover of darkness.
Back in 2004, Richard Reyn-
olds from London set up a blog
detailing his ‘guerilla gardening’
activities. Initially, he was just
a frustrated gardener who de-
cided to spruce up a neglected
council block in Southwark. But
his exploits have now inspired
‘guerrilla gardening’ activists
all over the globe. In 2008 he
published a book about ‘guer-
rilla gardening’, which details
the activities of ‘cells’ in thirty
different countries.
Feel inspired? New York’s
‘Green Guerillas’ used to use
simple ‘seed grenades’ to help
them do their illicit gardening
activities back in the seven-
ties. You can make your own
‘seed grenade’ by following
these simple steps:
Step 1: Get one of the con-
doms still in your drawer from
Fresher’s Fair (be honest)
Step 2: Fill the condom with
wildflower seeds, water and
fertiliser (no, not that sort)
Step 3: Toss the condom
over a fence onto neglected
land
WARNING: Do not reuse these
condoms for sexual purposes
– this may lead to genital rag-
worts
“Research has
shown that people
who drive to work
along streets
lined with trees
tend to arrive at
work in a happier
frame of mind
than those who
drive to work along
streets without any
greenery.”
