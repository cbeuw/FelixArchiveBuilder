Textural Layers Androgyny
Fur In Colour
Billowing Sleeves
Mixing and matching is the way for-
ward next season. Whether it’s vin-
tage tweeds, warm knits, toughened
leather, pretty lace or sheer silk, this
season has us all wrapped up. Tex-
tural hybrids were seen at Alexander
Wang with elegant silk trains flowing
from beneath cosy ponchos, whilst
Chanel brought life to its smoulder-
ing catwalk by layering feathers and
tweed on top of sheers. Eveningwear
had a romantic twist: at Gucci, flut-
tering jackets were layered over
sheer floor length gowns, and de-
spite being shrouded in rumours, a
swashbuckling Karlie Kloss opened
at Christian Dior to much appraise.
How To Wear It: For those daring
enough, self-created texture hybrids
will guarantee plenty of warmth
come winter, but for rookies, tacti-
cal layering is key. A smooth elegant
sheer base is essential, then go wild
and throw on the chunkiest knits
you can find. Whatever you do, make
sure you pile it on. AY
Fur: the most opulent, controversial
and outspoken material of fashion
luxury, is once again the hot-ticket
for next season. However, fashionis-
tas take note: not just any old piece
of fluff will do. The bright colours for
the summer have filtered through
onto Autumn catwalks as the stand-
out fluffy pieces came in the bold-
est hues. Gucci, Dior and Bottega
Veneta all featured furs in jewel
tones ranging from golden yellow to
peacock blue; whilst a pastel palette
was favoured at Missoni, with sug-
ary lavenders and spearmint greens.
Giving a more natural feel, Celine
and Marni showcased patchwork
pieces in rusty oranges and deep
forest greens.
How To Wear It: Go all-out and make
sure no one misses you with a bright,
eye-catching fur coat, or rejuvenate
a plain outfit with a statement fur
skirt. Or keep it more subtle, keep-
ing touches of eye-popping furs to
bags, hats and stoles. AY
Gone are the days of the power-
shoulder: arms are fashion’s new
erogenous zone. With any echoes
of the 1980s long gone with the
end of 2010, we might attribute it
to fashion’s new decade of choice:
the 1970s. Looser silhouettes were
dominant throughout but especially
notable was the bulging and billow-
ing sleeve, seen at Burberry Pror-
sum on the coats, and then at Stel-
la McCartney and Jil Sander with
dropped shoulders tapering into
a wide sleeve. A definite favourite
was at Lanvin: Alber Elbaz elegantly
and effortlessly added the wide
upper-arm to his gorgeous cocktail
dresses.
How To Wear It: It’s easy to add a
fashion-forward edge to a classic
pencil skirt a-la Stella McCartney
with a rippling sheer blouse. It gives
sexy touch but the long sleeves keep
it demure, while the sheer fabric en-
sures that you don’t add any extra
weight to your upper arms. SV
Suits, ties, waistcoats and mannish
trousers: this is definitely one of my
favourite trends for this Autumn. The
look is perfectly smart, sophisticat-
ed and sexy, and is a perfect solu-
tion to rejuvenating a workwear rut.
With fully suited-and-booted ladies
alternating with starry ultra-feminine
girls at Dolce and Gabbana; boxy,
oversized jackets at Stella McCart-
ney and Céline and incredibly sexy
tomboys at Paul Smith (one of my
favourite shows of the season, with
by far the best trousers of the sea-
son) - there’s excitement for a revival
in preppy, polished shirts and slacks
for girls: tailoring brought bang up-
to-date.
How To Wear It: The item of the sea-
son as far as this trend is concerned
is the perfect pair of trousers: well-
cut and beautifully fitted, they will be
one of your most-used pieces for the
cold seasons. If you’re feeling up to
it, ties for girls seem to be key - keep
them skinny and minimal. SV
