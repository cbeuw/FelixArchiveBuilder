Scientific foundations of Tōhoku quake
L
ike all large earthquakes, the
Japanese quake occurred in
what is known as a subduc-
tion zone. In these zones – which are
common in the Paciﬁc – large slabs of
solid rock called tectonic plates move
towards each other. When they collide,
the less dense plate will ride over the
denser plate, which is forced below the
other.
Micheal Warner, Professor of Geo-
physics at Imperial College, specialises
in crustal seismology. Warner explained,
“as the plates push past each other, the
friction created locks the plates tem-
porarily together in a boundary zone.
Elastic stresses build up in the rocks in
this boundary. Eventually this stress is
sufﬁcient to overcome friction and es-
sentially breaks the locked boundary
between the plates. This causes a sudden
release of stored elastic energy. Some of
the energy that is released propagates
as seismic waves. It is these waves that
knock down buildings”.
The total amount of energy released
depends on the strength of the rocks, the
size of the fault (the fractures in these
rocks) and the total ‘slip’ that ensues
when the friction becomes too much.
“Strong rocks, a large fault, and large
slip gives a big event”, says Warner. “In
subduction zones – the faults are long,
the cold rocks are strong, and there is a

Warner explains. “Japan has very good
earthquake resistant building codes.
Most damage and loss of life was as a
result of the tsunami which is very dif-
ﬁcult to protect against other than by be-
ing elsewhere.”

EARTHQUAKE PROOFING
B
uilding in an earthquake zone
is, unsurprisingly, a tricky
business. Japan is no stranger
to earthquakes, so it has a strict build-
ing code in place and some very sturdy
buildings. After the Kobe earthquake in
1995, which killed about 6000 people,
Japan put enormous resources into de-
signing new buildings that could with-
stand major earthquakes and also retro-
ﬁtting older, more vulnerable ones.
Instead of trying to make buildings
earthquake proof, engineers instead
design them to be damaged — but in a
controlled way that aims to only affect
speciﬁc parts of the structure.
Peter Stafford, from the Department
of Civil and Environmental Engineer-
ing at Imperial, explained why:
“The act of getting damaged is
the way in which structures
are able to dissipate the en-
ergy put into them by earth-
quakes”. If there was no
damage, there would be no-
where for the energy
o f
the
earthquake to
go.
Flexibility is key; tall-
er buildings often have an advan-
tage here as they can sway back
and forth
more eas-
ily than
shorter build-
ings, and because
of this, counterintuitively,
they are safer. Short buildings are
very rigid and can be shaken violently
as the ground moves during an earth-
quake.
Earthquakes cause sideways forces
that shake buildings. Some buildings
rest on huge rubber and steel pads that
can slide from side to side when an
earthquake hits and disperse this side-
ways energy. However, these pads only
work for structures up to 20 or 30 sto-
reys high; any taller and the building
squashes the pads and makes them use-
less.
Some Japanese high-rise buildings
also have a skeleton of steel braces and
hydraulic shock absorbers. These damp-
en the earthquake energy as it moves up
the building.
Japan is also well prepared for tsu-
namis, with seawalls in many coastal
towns that can be as high as 40ft, and
tsunami shelters on higher ground.

FIXING FUKUSHIMA
A
s well as causing billions of
dollars worth of damage to the
buildings in the Tōhoku region
of Japan, the earthquake has created
one of the most serious building
casualties in history – the Fuku-
shima I Nuclear Power Plant. The
earthquake, and subsequent tsu-
nami, has resulted in a series of inci-
dents that has lead to dangerous levels
of radiation leaked to the local environ-
ment – an accident that will cost several
billion more to ﬁx.
The earthquake, while destabilising the
building integrity of the reactors, also re-
sulted in the automatic shut down of the
reactor cores. The subsequent tsunami,
however, delivered the potentially fatal
blow, by knocking out the generators
used to power the water pumps used to
cool the spent fuel storage pools. Nor-
mally, pools are kept at around 25°C, but
with the temperature in Unit 4 at 84°C as
of the 15th of March, the risk of the wa-
ter level dropping sufﬁciently to expose
the fuel is rising. Were this to happen a
risk of radioactive leak could occur.
Dr John Hassard, a reader in Physics
at Imperial, believes the worst is yet to
come. “The fact they are pumping in sea
water to cool the cores is desperation. It
is not good practice.” Indeed, the situa-
tion is getting so desperate, authorities
have had to arrange water drops via
helicopters onto the overheating fuel
stores. According to Hassard, the inci-
dent is a disaster for nuclear power – not
just for Fukushima, but for its reputa-
tion as an uncontrollable and dangerous
force. “It’s not that we expect tsunamis
in Sizewell B, but it shows how complex
the systems are and how difﬁcult it is to
mitigate against failures for complex
systems like nuclear plants.”
Dr Hassard points out that while the
wind direction has helped divert a ma-
jority of the contamination toward the
Paciﬁc, it cannot be relied on for too
“The tsunami is very
difficult to protect
against other than by
being elsewhere”

lot of accumulated slip
to release”.
Tsunamis, like the
one that followed last
Friday’s earthquake,
are triggered when the sea
bed moves and “displaces
a column of sea water verti-
cally. Gravity works to restore
a horizontal sea surface but the
resulting disturbance propagates as a
wave. This wave has small amplitude
in deep water, but the amplitude grows
dramatically as the wave enters shallow
water – somewhat like a conventional
wave steepening before it breaks on a
sloping beach.”
It was the tsunami rather than the
earthquake that drove the majority of
the devastation in north-east Japan,
long. “The local people are deﬁnitely
in danger”, he says. “The radiation will
be dominated by Caesium-134 and 137,
and a number of other radionuclides,
most with shorter half lives.”
While the full extent of the damage
is yet to be known, Hassard notes that
reactor safety technology has evolved
since the 1980s. Had there been a tem-
perature excursion in the RBMK reac-
tors of Chernobyl, we would very likely
have seen a situation much much worse.
