Gastronomical Musings
Vicky says:
‘Tis the season to be stuffed like a Lindt chocolate
truffle: chocolate eggs, crème eggs, mini eggs…
or any egg you can get your hands on that fulfills
the criteria of: subpar chocolate egg shell, a mini
surprise of the branded chocolate you could have
bought without the subpar chocolate egg shell and a
taste that makes you wish you hadn’t eaten the sub-
par chocolate egg shell. Of course, all this wouldn’t
have to happen if you’d just paid attention to the
Annual Felix Easter Egg review.
But what else is there to eat during Easter apart
from chocolate? A plenty lot more, I tell you. Next
time you’re eating a warm hot cross bun, think of
Eostre, the springtime goddess that you’re inadver-
tently honouring by consuming the bun. Swap your
normal Sunday roast to a roast lamb dinner on Eas-
ter Sunday, as it is thought that the angel of God will
pass over your home and bring no harm. And if that
sounds all too surreal, feast your eyes on the pretzel
and try to imagine the torso of a person with their
arms folded praying. I wonder who George Bush
imagined as his pretzel when he famously choked
on the snack. Osama Bin Ladan perhaps?
T
his year, it’s all about meat in the
London restaurant scene. Hot
new arrivals include pop-up joint
#Meateasy (New Cross) serving
minced 28 day aged chuck steak
burgers, Philly cheesesteaks and other
North American grill classics. Satisfying
our pure, primitive desire to eat meat pro-
vides the comfort that lets us forget about
the grim times we’re in. Aside from the new
faces, capitalist London is full of legend-
ary gastronomic rivals who strive to outdo
each other in nothing other than preparing
the most exquisite meat. So where’s the
beef?
Oh no! The Wafflemeister vouchers
have expired!

THE
MEAT
FIGHT
BIG

THE BURGER Haché vs Byron
The cheeseburger, with a
massive juicy grilled patty
and oozing melted cheese,
accompanied by crisp fries.
Interestingly, this is the most
popular last meal chosen by
death row prisoners in America.
Please don’t tell me you still
go to GBK to have this revered
dish when there are at least two
top notch burger joints charg-
ing similar prices nearby. The
“Haché or Byron” debate has
divided Londoners for a few
years. If you’re a vegetarian,
you’d say Haché. Their falafel
sweetcorn burger with beetroot
is the only vegetarian dish that
I’d ever order and has the power
to salvage any vegetarian-carni-
vore relationship. (At Byron the
veggie option is an oversized
mushroom wedged between
buns.) However, Haché’s crucial
beef burgers are ironically spoilt
by their signature ciabatta buns
that don’t really work. Neverthe-
less, they have very strong pat-
ty potential. Byron, despite their
patchy service, makes incred-
ible burgers that are perfectly
medium-rare. They’re even bet-
ter than in Gordon Ramsey’s
Maze Grill.

THE ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT
BRAZILIAN BBQ
Are you looking for a meat
orgy? Or is it meat asphyxi-
ation? Head to one of these ha-
vens that’ll leave you paralysed
in pleasure. In the Rodizio, or
Brazilian barbeque, waiters
glide from table to table with
hunks of meat on swords, stop-
ping to carve a pile on your
plate until you tell them to
stop. It’s about quality, quan-
tity, and variety too. There’s
straight-off-the-barbeque beef
ribs, lamb, gammon, chorizo,
chicken hearts, baby beef and
more, which will work you up
into a frenzy. You name a cut
of meat, they’ll have it. If you
somehow get bored of the pro-
tein monotony, there’s a colos-
sal buffet of Brazilian dishes
such as fritters, feijoada
stews, rice and salads too. Out
of the two restaurants, Rodizio
Rico has the edge with their
wonderfully flavourful, smoky
cuts of meat and cheerful ser-
vice. At £23.50 a head, it might
feel slightly pricey but you’ll get
your money’s worth if you play
it right, i.e., fill up on sirloin.
There’s a Rodizio Rico branch
opening in Fulham Broadway
soon. Definitely something to
look forward to.

OUR LOCAL FAVOURITE
Best Mangal vs Bodean’s
People travel miles on their
bicycles and through zones
on the tube for the best ke-
bab in London at Best Mangal
(West Kensington). How lucky
we are to have the beautiful-
ly charred, boldly marinated
Turkish barbecued meats piled
high, just on our doorstep. The
multitudes of Meze dishes are
colourful and exotic both in
appearance and flavour. It’s
a delight to mop up the juices
with their homemade breads
whether it’s out of the take-
away box or off the plate in
their cosy restaurant.
Bodean’s American Diner
with a branch in Fulham Broad-
way is another local that does
barbeque, but in an oak-burn-
ing smoke-pit rather than over
charcoal. Their slow-cooked
goodies include ribs, chicken
wings, pulled pork and beef
brisket burnt ends. Be pre-
pared for some unsophisti-
cated hands-on meat-eating
with sticky barbeque sauce
everywhere. My recommenda-
tion is the shared platter for
two, which lets you sample
everything they have in the
smoke-pit. The free “Q-card”
membership card entitles you
to some decent offers such as
a complimentary dessert, like
a big wedge of gooey American
pecan tart, or schnapps.
