BUCS Final

IC Women’s 9 - 5 UWIC
IC Women’s 8 - 3 Warwick
IC Women’s 13 - 4 Exeter
On Sunday the IC girls’ water polo team
deservedly qualified for the BUCS tro-
phy final after playing incredibly well
throughout the season. They played a
gruelling three consecutive matches
and impressed in all of them. Initially
the girls were down a couple of goals
in their first match, and their second,
but their determination and team-work
brought them back to win their matches
9-5 against UWIC, 8-3 against Warwick
and 13-4 against Exeter. By the end of
the day it was clear that IC girls were a
formidable force!
By winning their matches on Sunday
the girls’ team have won the southern
second division trophy league and so in
the final will go up against the winners
of the northern division.
On Sunday the top goal scorer was
captain; Sarah Bennett. However, the
season’s top goal scorer has been tightly
contested between Sarah, Vera Gielen
and Hannah Collins, leaving the final
as a decider as to who claims the title.
Special mention has to go to our goalie
on Sunday, Anna Joy Drury, who played
despite being very ill. She made some
amazing saves and appeared to be com-
pletely on the ball despite her illness.
The only thing she failed to realise
was they had actually won the first two
matches, rather than lost them, like she
thought!
The team consists of girls from all dis-
ciplines, from Chemists to Medics, and
they all came together as an incredible
team to achieve their well-deserved suc-
cess.
Since the girls won their group, South
East England, they now will move up
to the 1st division to compete against
teams like Oxford and Cambridge in the
championship. In the first round the girls
had an incredible goal difference of over
60 points. Throughout the season they
have not lost a single match and are be-
ginning to appear invincible. Let’s hope
that this continues right through to the
final and on to next year.
The girls could have not performed as
well as they did if it hadn’t been for their
fantastic coach, Adam Walzer. Who en-
couraged and supported the girls even
through the hardest and most stressful
matches.
At the end of this year unfortunately
both Vera Gielen and Sarah Benett will
be leaving, after 5 and 3 years respec-
tively, of being part of the water polo
team. They will be greatly missed and
next year the team hopes to continue the
great successes that they have brought
to the club. Congratulations also go to
the IC mixed water polo team who won
the ULU league after a nail-biting final
game against UCL.
