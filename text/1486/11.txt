“Pretentious hipster shit,
but damn these extra
honeycomb sweets are
good.” 3/5
“Essential Lindt taste:
tasty milky yumminess”
5/5
“Just the egg, and it also
tastes far too healthy.
Another thing: weird after-
taste” 2/5
“Quite light, and not that
rich. Acceptable if you’re
allergic to everything.”
3/5
“A deep rich taste that
leaves you gagging for
more” 5/5
“Not how an egg should
behave, I don’t agree
with its sensibilities. Too
chewy.” 1/5
“Like being pummelled
in the face by a younger,
leaner Frank Bruno:
dangerous” 4/5
“Doesn’t capture the
magic of Twirls. Nothing
about it is ‘Twirly’” 2/5
“Thin egg for starters.
Looks fancy, tastes
boring.” 1/5
“So much promise, so
little satisfaction. Baileys
on the rocks over this
anyday.” 2/5
“Irrationally suprised by
extra treats even though
they’re displayed on the
box. Egg’s alright.” 2/5
“Has the consistency of
a Wispa bar twice-melted
in a hot car. Generic taste
too.” 3/5
WINNER!
