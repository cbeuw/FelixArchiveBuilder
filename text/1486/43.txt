Union to serve Rhinoceros
I
n light of the unparalled success
the Union’s offerings of exotic
meats has had on getting students
to actually eat the shit they serve
there, FiveSixEight will have a
6oz Sumatran Rhinoceros burger as its
guest burger next term, caught wild in
the deepest forests of Borneo. Despite
protests from vegetarians and other self-
righteous douchebags, the decision to
put the endangered – we mean – deli-
cious species between two buns next to
some curly fries was made last Friday,
when it became clear that the College’s
populace had developed quite a taste
for undomesticated animals following
record sales of the Zebra Burger. Still,
Imperial’s large Chinese demographic
welcomed the move, with one particu-
lar student stating that “it’s not quite the
ground rhino horn we were after, but it’s
a start”.
It is also rumoured that this controver-
sial menu item is merely a way of dis-
posing of the rhino carcasses that were
dumped outside the Rector’s office as
part of the protests against staff cuts in
the biochemistry department without ril-
ing PETA. PETA has had a long history
of conflict with Imperial’s Union: last
year one of their members defecated on
one of the pool tables and proceeded to
incriminate UCL by spraying their ini-
tials on the floor.
Rhinoceros meat is naturally low in
cholesterol while being high in iron,
zinc and other transition metals your
body needs. Before you tuck into the
latest fad be advised, however: it is also
high in tasty yet heart-stopping saturat-

The extremely rare and magestic Rhinosceros is endangered, and yummy. The one pictured
will be available on Thursday
ed fats, so the government recommends
that you limit your intake of rhinoceros
meat to just three 6oz burgers per day,
roughly equivalent to an entire animal
every eight months.
Of course, with fewer than 300 ani-
mals remaining the burger won’t stay
on the menu forever, so get down to
FiveSixEight and order one while you
can!
