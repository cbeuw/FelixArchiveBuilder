Hockey: Imperial come back
from behind twice, to keep
their record intact
After watching Imperial register two
wins and a draw against the Medics,
there was a lot of pressure on the Men’s
1st team. Imperial played to their full
potential and ran out 5-4 winners.
Imperial started in the best possible
manner, winning an early short corner.
Sam injected and Jaideep Desai set him-
self up for a huge hit that resembled a
golf swing more than a hockey shot.
This hit popped up in the air, and JD re-
acted first to the loose ball, playing in
captain Ewan Quince for him to put Im-
perial 1-0 up.
Imperial continued their dominance
and good midfield work from veteran
Nick Jones led to Ewan setting up Koch
for a golden chance, which sadly went
straight at the keeper. The Medics soon
won a short corner, which would have
gone in, but for Matty J’s interception.
Sadly, from the resulting short corner,
the Medics converted to enter the half
time at 1-1.
At this stage, it was anyone;s game,
and an inspirational team talk from
Ewan was necessary. Imperial took this
to heart and early in the second half,
Jones, the Finesmaster for the team,
broke with outrageous pace to set up a
chance that Koch put just wide.
Imperial kept knocking at the door.
Another piece of beautiful play from
Jones saw a cross go agonisingly past
JD’s stick. All this good work was un-
done in one swift move as a Medic
counter attack saw them win another
short. Despite the best efforts of Lars, a
great routine saw the Medics bury a shot
into the bottom corner, just past Vish’s
dive.
Imperial’s response was almost in-
stant. Great work from Gilles on the
right saw Imperial win a short corner.
Tom Koch’s excellent drag flick pulled
Imperial level. The Medics response
was swift and deadly, with College
caught napping, The Medics were ahead
again. A great response from Imperial
almost followed, with Ewan rattling the
crossbar. This was followed up by Ewan
hitting the side of the goal from a Nick
Prior through ball. Imperial did not have
to wait long and a hit from Gilles saw
captain-elect Sam put the equaliser past
the keeper.
Straight from the push off, Imperial
pushed and JD converted a Jones cross
Varsity Men’s Hockey
Imperial 5 - 4 Medicals
Keshava Murthy to put College 4-3 up. The message was
clear, be certain and composed, clearly
no one told Sam who got himself a yel-
low and a ten minute sin-bin. Despite
the Medics advantage, Imperial man-
aged to go 5-3 up. Ewan with his back
to the goal swiveled and roofed his shot
into the top right. It was no less than IC
deserved.
The Medics were not done and a drive
down the right hand side saw the Medics
score from the top of the D. No sooner
did IC relinquish their one man disad-
vantage, did Tom Koch get himself sent
off. The Medics won a short to push for
an equaliser, but stern defending from
Lars and Matty J. saw IC see it, and the
game, out. A 5-4 win, a pulsating match
and proof that, in hockey, Imperial are
better than the Medics.
