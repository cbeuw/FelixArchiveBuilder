Election winners announced
The Imperial College Union Sabbati-
cal and Student Trustee election results
were released last Monday at Council.
RCSU President Scott Heath beat clos-
est contender Danish Khan in the third
stage of the voting process by 1983 to
1593 votes to be elected Union presi-
dent. Heath said in a statement that he
“would like to thank everybody who
voted”, including his opponents “who
made the election fun and ran good
campaigns”. He hopes that he will “re-
pay [his voters’] trust and faith with
a great ICU 11/12” and “continue the
trend of good student-sabbatical com-
munication”.
In other results, Monya Zard, who
ran uncontested, was elected as Deputy
President (Clubs & Societies). She said
that she was “excited to be sharing an
office with Michael Foster,” who was
elected as Deputy President (Finance &
Services). Jason Parmar narrowly beat
Stefan Bauer to become Deputy Presi-
dent (Education). Nicolas Massie was
elected as Deputy President (Welfare)
and Matt Colvin as Felix Editor. Felix
Editor was the most closely contended
position with Colvin beating Alexander
Karapetian by only 68 votes.
Nathaniel Bottrell, Eugene Chang,
Ravi Pall and Abdul Patel were elected
to roles of student trustees, who sit on
the Union’s Trustee Board, its governing
body, without taking a year out. Heath
praised those elected for their “broad
range of skills and ideas”.

Record turnout as Union
innovates with live voting stats
Imperial College Union had one of the
highest election turnouts, so far this
year, of any UK university, with 32.5%
of students voting. A record 5,033 out
of 26,809 students participated, which
is an increase of 50% from last year’s
3,387 voters. For the first time ever, the
Union showed live voting stats on their
websites throughout the voting period,
allowing students to see turnout for dif-
ferent departments and halls.
The Faculty of Natural Sciences had
the largest turnout with 41% of students
voting. The engineers came in second
with 35.3% and the Medics came third
with 23.5%.
Every hall of residence voted and had
at least a 10% increase on the number
of people voting. Additionally, Medi-
cine undergraduates saw the largest
increased turnout compared to their
previous year.
For the second consecutive year, the
Life Sciences department has had the
highest voting turnout. Materials stu-
dents went from the lowest voting re-
corded last year straight up to the highest
turnout for this year for the Engineering
department. Although most other uni-
versities are still in the election process,
the participation from other student
unions that have completed their elec-
tions has not matched up to Imperial.
Even though Southampton had a stag-
gering 7,285 voters from a student body
of 23,000 students this was 30% of their
eligible students. Kings College Union
had a record number of voters – 4,024,
which only made up 18% of their stu-
dents. Only 12.14% of University Col-
lege London students voted in their
elections, giving a total of 2996 voters.
Edinburgh had 22% of their students
voting and Sheffield had 24%.
Therefore in terms of percentage of
students that participated in the student
elections, with 32.5% of the student
body voting, Imperial currently holds
the top position in the UK.
