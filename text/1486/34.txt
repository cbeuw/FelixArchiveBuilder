Polka Dots
“All that glitters is not gold” – maybe
so, but this season both glitter and
gold have lit up catwalks from New
York to Milan. This season at Ralph
Lauren, exotic velvet gowns embroi-
dered with beaded art glided the cat-
walk, a glimmering emerald dress
teamed with red peep-toes deliver-
ing an oriental twist. Models at Os-
car de la Renta and Versace shone
in figure hugging dresses intricately
covered in sequins and beads.
Meanwhile, feminine strength came
through at Louis Vuitton with sharp,
geometric oversized sequins cov-
ered restrained silhouettes. Who
said winter had to be dark and dull?
How To Wear It: Party girls should
try a short shimmering dress, chan-
nelling 1970s disco diva, or add an
androgynous twist to laid back glam-
our with a sequin jacket. If you re-
ally want to steal the show, you must
sparkle from head to toe, but be
warned: this body-skimming look is
not for the faint-hearted. AY
Belts: With so much concentration
on the powerful, strong woman, the
lure of a defined waist was ines-
capable. Alberta Ferretti and Jason
Wu chose thin belts with a decora-
tive bow and belts were even worn
atop coats at Burberry, Yves Saint
Laurent and Valentino for added el-
egance.
Boots: As expected for the colder
seasons, boots stomped down cat-
walks everywhere. Thigh high boots
featured in pretty embellished jewel-
coloured velvet at Alberta Ferretti,
whilst Prada showcased playful and
vibrant python knee-highs and Cha-
nel exhibited flat, toughened biker
boots in mixed textures with wide
grungy scrunched ankles.
How to Wear It: With such an array
of variations, there is no excuse for
either cold feet, or a baggy waist.
Shops will be brimming with acces-
sories to suit every personality, so
it’s a great time to invest! AY
Stripes will have gone with the sun-
shine of the Spring/Summer season,
the new pattern of choice is definite-
ly the polka dot for next season. Di-
ane von Furstenburn showed spots
of all shapes and sizes combined,
whilst Stella McCartney favoured a
more graphic approach with a scat-
ter-graph of spots in monochromatic
black or white forming a key trend
in the second half of her show in
Paris. Marc Jacobs arguably began
the trend in New York, with chic, 40s
inspired silhouettes featuring petite
polka dots being combined on piec-
es from top to toe. The look is piling
on the polka dots with different co-
lours and sizes, creating a cohesive
yet creative ensemble.
How To Wear It: Too much just isn’t
enough with spots next season: pile
on your polka dots but keep it ele-
gant with a smooth, fitted silhouette
and a defined waist. For the less ad-
venturous, a cute polka dot blouse is
a sweet and simple solution. SV
Amongst the autmnal hues seen
on the catwalks for next season,
which ranged from deep purples
and reds from rust to tomato, a co-
lour that dominated on both sides
of the Atlantic was definitely teal
green. A nice change from fashion’s
go-to non-colour of choice, black,
this Autumn/Winter season seems
to come in a rather richly coloured
package. The teal came thick and
fast in fabrics ranging from shim-
mering silk-satin at Gucci, raw silk at
Haider Ackermann and bright, blocky
opaque wool at Hermes. Whatever
fabric they chose, looks incorporat-
ing teal always stole the show.
How To Wear It: One piece in teal is
crucial for Autumn/Winter this year.
Whether you go for a full-length eve-
ning dress, blouse, jumper or maxi-
skirt, it’s the key colour for next
season. Combine it with denim or
leather, for a chic twist to an off-duty
casual look, or go all-out teal for the
evening with golden accents. SV
