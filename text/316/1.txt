Few could have been surprised by the result of last week's presi-
dential election. The opinion poll that we published last week showed
that as early as the Friday before the election many had the intention
of registering an abstention, and the amount of literature put around
the college by the constituent college Unions over the weekend
clinched the matter. On Monday morning, when balloting opened,
leading executive members were still more than doubtful that this pro-
paganda would have any positive effect other than people staying
away from the polls: but on Tuesday evening, when it was learnt that
the magic thresholdfigureof one thousand had been reached, and
the poll was valid, no-one had any further doubts.
For those of you who
have been dazed by the
events of recent weeks
and/or have missed our
articles and Union meet-
ings, and of course for
the Martians who will be
reading "Felix" in cen-
turies' time and wondering
what the heck we were all
up to in 1972, it would
seem worthwhile to repro-
duce here a potted guide
to election procedure and
how it has operated over
the last few weeks.
Every Spring, the Presi-
dent, Secretary and Deputy

President (and for that
matter the Editor of
"Felix") for the coming
academic year are elected
by college-wide ballot.
These elections are con-
ducted in the same way as
a Parliamentary election,
though on a necessarily
smaller scale. Nominations
are posted on a board in
the Union with twenty
seconders' names append-
ed. On the Thursday fol-
lowing the close of nomi-
nations there is a Union
Meeting at which "hust-
ings" for the candidates
are held: that is, the pro-
poser makes a short speech
in favour of the candidate,
the candidate speaks for
himself, the same happens
for the others standing,
and the audience then
asks questions of the as-
sembled candidates. On

ALBERT HALL SEATS
- the hard facts
The voice of MCB reverberated around the hall. Was
this another Union meeting? — couldn't be, not a paper
dart in sight. What was this gathering of people, clothed
in garb so rarely seen. Could it be a rehearsal for
Commemoration Day? No . . . it was the real thing. A
few seconds before, as the procession of college digni-
taries crawled forward the Albert Hall was transformed
into Westminster Abbey — the choir singing and the
people standing.
Thus it came to pass
that MCB stood at the
rostrum. Was it the
minutes of the last Union
meeting he was reading?
A list of parking alloca-
tions? No. It was just the
introduction to the cere-
mony. The half full (or
half empty, if you're a
pessimist) Albert Hall was
tense with excitement,
necks craning, ears intent
on the softest whisper and
eyes straining to witness
the strange rites to be per-
formed that afternoon.
Lord Penney in his last
rectorial address was mer-
cifully short but, alas, the
presentation of associate-
ships which followed
proved not to be so. What
can be said of those 50
minutes? Sweet music
straining from the stage,
the fragrance of the flow-
ers and as each cloaked
figure advanced across the
stage the loudspeakers
boomed a name.
The results of three aca-
demic years are acknow-
ledged by a bow from the
chairman of the board of
governors. Those years of
lectures, reams of notes,
hours of computing, sleep-
less nights, gallons (oops I
mean litres) of coffee lead
to a set of letters after
your name and a bow or,
a handshake, if you are
one of the lucky ones with
a prize.
But mum was pleased,
so was dad and after all
it's only once in your life.
I mean, it's not as though
you have to go every year.
Imagine how the people
who have to sit through it
every year must feel like.
There was worse to
come. The choir gave
some respite with their
singing and there it was,
like a nightmare, forever
haunting—over 700 DICs
awarded. Thank God, not
all were there to receive
them.
Gradually you could
feel the chairs in the Al-
bert Hall becoming less
comfortable. The air began,
to seethe with restlessness.
Was this all the famous
rites consisted of?
Dr. Whitrow assumed
the role of Eamonn And-
rews giving us potted
biographies of the 5 new
fellows of the college who
included the rector's suc-
cessor, Sir Brian Flowers,
Sir Edward Playfair,
whose name needs no in-
troduction and last but
not least Professor Sir
Alan Hodgkin, President
of the Royal Society.
The chairs seemed to be
getting more uncomfort-
able. The sound of
watches being wound was
to be heard as Sir Alan
Hodgkin moved forward
toward the rostrum. Can
you find a relationship be-
tween History of the col-
lege, including of course
details of Prince Albert;
the building of Japanese
supertankers and the sci-
