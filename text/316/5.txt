The Whys and Wherefores
of Buying a House
A brief guide to what happens during the course
of a normal house purchase transaction and an
indication of the steps which you should follow
to prepare yourself for what will possibly be the
largest personal financial transaction you will
ever undertake.

Preparation
It is quite likely that at the
time of reading this you have
no plans for the purchase of
your future home. However,
the time to lay the founda-
tions for this monumental
purchase is undoubtedly the
present. There is no need, at
this stage, to decide posi-
tively upon the method of
repayment of your future
mortgage advance but it is
as well to give some thought
to the source from whom you
hope to obtain the funds and
also the vehicle by which you
intend to repay them.
First, select your building
society. Different societies
have different views on the
amount of money they will
advance to individuals and
the term over which they
will lend it. Membership of
a particular society will not
guarantee a mortgage of any
particular size when you re-
quire it, but it will mean
that the society that you sel-
ect will give you preference as
an existing member, an ad-
vantage which can be inval-
uable, particularly when
funds are in short supply. A
point to be borne in mind is
that whilst some societies will
pay a slightly higher rate of
interest on investments, they
might not be quite so gen-
erous when assessing the
amount of a mortgage ad-
vance in the future.
Most societies offer similar
forms of savings accounts,
ranging from the simple In-
vestment Account, in which
a minimal sum may be de-
posited and added to or sub-
tracted from at will to regular
monthly savings accounts
paying a slightly higher rate
of interest; government-link-
ed S.A.Y.E. savings schemes
over a term of five years and
the longer term insurance
linked bonds. Before decid-
ing finally upon the type of
account which you wish to
use you would be well ad-
vised to discuss your future
plans with someone conver-
sant with the mortgage
scene. The N.U.S. has its own
insurance advisory service
with a mortgage department
who are able to help with
this aspect.
There are two methods by
which a mortgage may be re-
paid:—
A. The level monthly repay-
ment method.
Each month a sum is re-
paid to the building society
comprising interest and re-
payment of capital. Life
assurance protection is not
included in such an ar-
rangement but it is very
wise, in fact necessary, to
effect a mortgage protec-
tion policy for the amount
and term of the loan so
that in the event of the
death of the borrower be-
fore the end of the select-
ed period, the sum assur-
ed under this policy will
repay the outstanding
amount of the loan.
B. The endowment method.
An endowment assurance
policy is one where a sum
is payable at the end of
an agreed period or on
death of the assured.
With this method an en-
dowment policy is effected
for an amount equal to the
mortgage advance and for
an identical term. The
policy is usually on the
borrowers life and is as-
signed to the building soc-
iety. However, no actual
repayment of capital is
made to the society during
the term of the mortgage.
The loan is repaid at the
end of the selected period
from the benefits payable
when the endowment pol-
icy matures. In the event
of the death of the bor-
rower before the end of
the selected period, the
sum assured repays the
loan in full.
There will be two pay-
ments in this1
case, one
consisting of interest only
to the building society and
the other, being the prem-
ium on the policy, to the in-
surance company concern-
ed.
Again, at this stage, it
would be wise to take advice
in order to make the neces-
sary preparations.
Buying a house
First, find your house.
More often than not, you
will have been through many
viewings before finding one
to suit your taste and your
pocket. Negotiate a price
with the vendor (the seller).
If an estate agent has ar-
ranged the introduction he
would usually have to put
your offer to the vendor in
order to confirm that it is
acceptable to him. There is,
however, nothing to stop you
from negotiating direct with
the seller.
At this stage a "holding"
or "preliminary" deposit is
often required by an agent.
The sum is usually nominal
and is often no more than
£25 or £50. It does not form
part of any legal transaction
and is used merely to dis-
courage frivolous enquiries.
Where possible payment
should be made through your
solicitor, although an agent
will often insist on the de-
posit being paid direct to
him. It is not usual for the
full deposit of 10 per cent to
be paid now. If there is no
estate agent involved then
you should not hand over a
deposit without first consult-
ing your solicitor.
In all cases where a de-
posit is paid a receipt must
be obtained and it should al-
ways confirm that the de-
posit is paid "subject to con-
tract". This means that you
can withdraw from the tran-
saction and recover your de-
posit at any time before
contracts are exchanged.
Unless these crucial words
are included you could pos-
sibly lose your deposit
should you decide in the
early stages not to proceed
as a result of a poor survey
report or difficulty in ob-
taining a mortgage.
The mortgage
This is the stage at which
your foundation planning
will come into its own as the
obtaining of a mortgage can
prove difficult if your cir-
cumstances or the type of
property are in any way "out
of the ordinary". Discuss the
matter again with your ad-
visor.
You should also now take
steps to appoint a solicitor if
you do not already have one.
In this connection it is often
financially advantageous to
use the same solicitor as the
building society through
whom you are obtaining your
mortgage. The solicitor will
wish to take instructions re-
garding the address of the
property to be purchased, the
name of the vendor and the
purchase price.
A survey
Having made your offer to
buy and perhaps paid a pre-
liminary deposit you would
be wise to consider the ques-
tion of a professional survey.
If you are buying the pro-
perty with the aid of a mort-
gage, the building society
will have the property sur-
veyed at your expense. How-
ever this survey is merely a
valuation of the property for
the benefit of the building
society and you will not see
the report; neither will you
be able to take any action
against the surveyor at a
later date if anything goes
wrong. Many people consider
that the fact that a building
society is prepared to make
an advance is sufficient re-
assurance. However if you in-
struct your own surveyor you
will receive his report and
it is his duty to give you an
accurate survey. If he does
not he can be held respon-
sible for compensation at
some time in the future. His
report will be detailed and
will contain details of the
structural condition of the
property as a whole and not
merely with a view to setting
a value upon it.
The cost of a private sur-
vey depends upon the value
of the property and you
would oe wise to make en-
quiries from the surveyor be-
fore instructing him to pro-
ceed.
If you have any difficulty
selecting a surveyor to make
a report then you should
have a word with your soli-
citor.
The legal aspect
At this early stage in the
purchase your solicitors will
request the vendor's solici-
tors to prepare and submit
a draft contract. This will
confirm the agreement to
sell and to buy and also
gives details of the vendor's
legal right to dispose of the
property.
The contract will cover
many aspects and should re-
fer to a plan of the property.
This is to ensure that you are
purchasing the house that
you wish to buy!
The vendor's land certifi-
cate or title deeds are pro-
duced to prove his right to
sell and if the property is
leasehold the lease will also
have to be inspected.
The time factor at this
stage varies quite consider-
able depending upon the var-
ious formalities which have
to be undertaken. However,
whilst awaiting receipt of a
draft contract, your solicitor
will carry out certain local
searches on your behalf. The
object of these is to find out
as much as possible about
the house that you are buy-
ing and the surrounding area
and questions are asked of
the local authority. There are
numerous questions to be
asked concerning such things
as road widening, new roads
and redevelopment plans but
the intention is to ensure
that there are no hidden
snags affecting your pur-
chase. Your solicitor should
not permit you to enter any
commitment to buy without
the local authorities' answers
being satisfactorily received.
At the same time various
"preliminary enquiries" are
also made of the vendor's
solicitor. The purpose of
these enquiries is to ascer-
tain the rateable value of the
property; who owns fences
and walls, whether there are
any disputes about bound-
aries, whether planning per-
missions and building per-
missions have been obtained,
the earliest date on which
completion may be arranged
and numerous other ques-
tions. You should be kept in-
formed of any relevant points
raised by these enquiries.
All the previously mention-
ed searches and enquiries
will take some time to com-
plete, but generally speaking,
a minimum period of two
weeks will probably elapse
before everything is satis-
factorily answered.
When you have received
confirmation from your
building society that an ad-
vance will be made your
solicitor should then be in
a position to prepare a con-
tract for signature. At this
point a completion date will
be decided upon and finally
contracts will be formally ex-
changed.
Exchange of contracts
Contracts are formally ex-
changed when the copy which
you have signed is exchang-
ed for the copy signed by
the vendor. The remainder of
the 10 per cent deposit is en-
closed with your copy of the
contract. Your portion of the
contract has to be offered
first; the vendor's is only re-
turned in receipt of yours.
You may find it difficult
at this stage to raise the re-
mainder of the 10 per cent
deposit, particularly if you
are depending upon the sale
of an existing property to
raise funds or if you are bor-
rowing from a building soc-
iety and providing less than
10 per cent of the total your-
self. If you have difficulties,
your solicitor or bankers will
probably be able to help.
Once contracts have been
exchanged you are bound to
purchase the property and
your deposit is not normally
recoverable unless there are
very exceptional circum
stances.
Insurance of the property
Once contracts are ex-
changed the property be-
comes your responsibility
from the insurance point of
view even though you will
not have moved in. The
building society granting
your mortgage will arrange
the insurance at your ex-
pense, normally debiting your
account. You should however,
ensure that the cover is for
the full market value of the
property.
Final arrangements
Following exchange of con-
tracts and before completion
your solicitor will have to
make final searches to see if
there are any outstanding
matters affecting the pro-
perty. He will need to know
if there is any mortgage on
the property which no ar-
rangements have been made
to repay. Final enquiries are
also made of the vendor's
solicitors concerning such
things as the whereabouts of
the keys to the property.
Completion
Completion is normally
one month after the ex-
change of contracts but this
can be varied by agreement
between yourself and the
vendor. His solicitor will in-
sert the actual date for com-
pletion into the contract.
Finally the form of convey-
ance is passed to the ven-
dor's solicitors for their
agreement. This is the form
that the vendor will sign to
transfer the property to you.
Your solicitor will submit his
report on title to the build-
ing society and arrange to ob-
tain the mortgage cheque
from them. He will also ar-
range for you to sign the
mortgage deed and will ad-
vise you on any last minute
queries which you may have.
Completion takes place
when the purchase price is
handed over in exchange for
the title deeds.
The conveyance has then
to be submitted to the Inland
Revenue for stamping and,
in the case of registered
land, to the land registry in
order to ensure that your
claim to the property is cer-
rectly stated.
Conclusion
The whys and wherefores
of buying a house are many
and varied and each of the.
above processes will vary
from one property to an-
other. However, it is hoped
that these notes will make it
easier for you to follow the
various transactions, at the
same time demonstrating
that there is more to buying
a house than merely handing
over the cash.
