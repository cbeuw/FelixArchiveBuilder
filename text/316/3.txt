October 31, 1972 FELIX Page 3
Election Fiasco
continued from page one
the following Monday and
Tuesday the elections
proper are held: all mem-
bers of the Union may
vote on production of their
current college Registra-
tion card.
This may seem obvious
to you, and you will ask
why I "waste" five column
inches explaining it. How-
ever, it is precisely the lack
of this information that in-
variably leads to the vast
majority of the electorate
regarding each impending
election with total incom-
prehension.
This election was worse.
Not only was there a great
increase in the lack of
comprehension of the elec-
tion procedure, since a
third of the electorate had
only three weeks' experi-
ence of the college and the
union, and thus no know-
ledge of the elections, but
of those that were "in the
know", few could bring
themselves to enthusiasti-
cally endorse the candida-
ture of either Rob Armi-
tage or Adrian Smith.
The election was neces-
sitated by Chris Sheppard,
President-Elect from this
spring's elections, deciding
to withdraw from his exa-.
minations and failing to
obtain the permission of
a Union General Meeting
to take up the post of
President whilst not being
"of good academic stand-
ing". So nomination
papers were duly posted
on the first day of term,
and the names of Adrian
Smith and Rob Armitage
duly appeared thereon.
Rob Armitage was Chair-
man of Rag last year, and
is External Affairs Officer
this: yet despite this con-
nection with the Union, he
appears to be little known
outside the Union Office,
where he is a popular fi-
gure. Adrian Smith has,
like Rob, a firm grasp of
student politics, but is a
self-declared lefty, which
is little asset in a college
as staunchly Liberal as
Imperial.
Many, it would seem,
looked at the election line-
up and despaired. The
executives of the consti-
tuent colleges went further.
They put it in writing.
They had their statement
read out at a "Meeting of
Imperial College Stu-
dents" (alias the inquorate
Hustings Union General
Meeting of two weeks'
ago) and then proceeded
to instruct their members,
by means of concentrated
propaganda distribution, to
abstain from the election.
That is, not just to stay
away from the polls, but
to go and vote and write
"Abstention" across the
ballot paper. They de-
clared that neither candi-
date was fit to be Presi-
dent, and that this was the
only way to show it.
It worked. The CCU's
have shown how powerful
they can be. But where has
it left Imperial College
Union? It will now be
necessary to hold another
election in about four
weeks' time. It is impera-
tive that we do end up
with a President this time
around. A continuation of
his fiasco amuses only the
most puerile members of
the Union. It will thus be
necessary that at least one
candidate stands who it
will be generally agreed is
capable of doing the job
properly.
One would think that
the constituent College
Unions would now feel
obliged to put up a candi-
date who they consider
worthy of the post. Whe-
ther or not they do will
remain to be seen. Ru-
mours of who might stand
are rife. I do not propose
to soil these pages or
"Felix's" name by indulg-
ing in printing their names
here. It is however safe
to say that they do not
include the names of any
who might induce a land-
slide victory, or indeed
any whose candidature
could be openly welcomed
by the broad mass of stu-
dents at Imperial. There
are, indeed, very few
names that spring to mind
who would fit into this
category. It is perhaps be-
cause some of them would
not wish, at this stage at
least, to take a sabbatical
year. What is not gene-
rally known is that the
President does not H A V E
to take this. It would un-
doubtedly be in the best
interests of the Union and
its members to have a non-
sabbatical president if
this would induce a cap-
able and popular person to
take on the job. The role
of the President would re-
vert to being the figure-
head of the Union: we
can manage for the rest of
the year Without the extra
work that he or she would
take on if sabbatical . . .
well, just.
What happens for the
next four weeks, then, un-
til a new president, sabba-
tical or not, is elected? Ian
Mackenzie has now fin-
ished his term as "Acting
President" — Council will
presumably take up its op-
tion on appointing a fur-
ther one at its meeting on
Monday next. Until the
next elections are over, the
feeling in the Union Of-
fice will remain one of
unease. If the next elec-
tion is a fiasco, Imperial
College Union will lose
much of its credibility.
This must not be allowed
to happen. But we may
have to do more than keep
our fingers crossed.
NEXT TIME
YOU'RE IN...
The 57th Imperial College Commemoration Day
ceremony was held last Thursday in the Royal
Albert Hall to commemorate the visit to the college
of Mr. Piers Corbyn now President of the Real
Estate Fund of America.
Mr. Corbyn, described by the then Rector, Lord
Penney as "a man who brought sanity to Imperial
College", was greeted on his arrival by a rendering
of his favourite pieces, Handel's "A cacophony of
White Noise", Mozart's "The 120 Decibel Suite",
and Debussy's "Midnight in Moscow" played simul-
taneously on the bells of Queen's Tower. Asked if he
remembered the Tower with great nostalgia he de-
clined to answer, apparently entranced by the mel-
odic sound but later found to be stone deaf.
The afternoon began with the student orator, the
late Mr. M. Black, the Grand Master of the Wor-
shipful company of Blackhead Squeezers, telling the
story of "a man and his St. Bruno". Just as an
anonymous assassin in the rear balcony uncovered a
sawn-off shotgun and was about to pick his spot the
orator abandoned his speech and began picking his
spots, muttering "it'sfinger-lickinggood" (believed
to be a reference to take-away Kentucky chicken).
The highlight of the proceedings then followed
when several hundred eminent members of the KIu-
Klux-Klan enshrouded in their bizarre and ethereal
ceremonial costume slowly marched across the stage
demonstrating against the immigration of Ugandan
Asians. A splendid and moving occasion reached a
climax as each and every marcher shook hands
with the beloved orator.
Although those named Aaron-Adams seemed a
little nonchalant in their approach, those further
down the alphabet showed progressively greater af-
fection for the orator as their handshakes lingered
long in deep esteem.
"It'sfinger-lickinggood", said the orator.
...TRY THE
FAMILY BUCKET
THE GREAT
TARTAN RACE
Once again the brewers
of Younger's Tartan beer
are promoting their Cha-
rity Race between Edin-
burgh and London. Next
year's event will start on
31st March and end by
4th April, 1973, to avoid
clashing with exams (!?)
The challenge is to
transport an empty, note
empty, 501b. beer cask by
fair means or foul between
Meadowbank Sports Sta-
dium, Edinburgh and the
Royal Scot Hotel, King's
Cross Road, London (near
the main line termini).
The race was such a suc-
cess last year (although IC
teams were conspicuous
by their absence), that a
wider range of categories
has been devised. These
are:
(a) Fastest team between
Edinburgh and London;
(b) Team collecting most
cash for their nominated
charity between the two
cities;
(c) Team making the most
unconventional journey be-
tween Edinburgh and
London.
If the challenge were not
enough, the winning teams
in each class will receive
£250, and ten dozen cans
of you-know-what ale will
be given to each member.
The sponsors will then
contribute £250 to each
winning team's nominated
charity.
There will also be two
teams of runners-up, per
class, each individual re-
ceiving "Beer for a Year",
and spot prizes for indivi-
dual journeys. The spon-
sors will also pay each
team member of each
selected team £30 for ex-
penses.
Entries must be returned
to the organisers by Fri-
day, December 22nd, so
let's have digits extracted
and all prospective mem-
bers apply to "Felix", to-
gether with any original
and unconventional ideas
on how to make the jour-
ney.

take heart those of you
looking for a job. You
could be next in line for
Presidency of the Royal

It's all over for this
year but one post scrip-
turn needs adding. With-
out doubt star of die
whole performance was
Prof. Barton, dressed in a
garment which w o r d s
alone cannot describe but
which transformed him in-
to something looking like
an Arabian version of a
Cardinal. Are there more
of such garments hidden
in college cupboards? If
so, then how about a pro-
fessorial fashion parade
and competition on fresh-
ers' day?
