Cars daubed
Protection racket formed
During the past weeks there has been a sharp in-
crease in the number of cars parked in the precincts
of I.C. Several cars have already had headlamps and
windscreens whitewashed and tyres let down.
This deplorable state of affairs has come to the notice
of a group of students. These students have formed a
society called the Imperial College Automobile Protec-
tion Society (or Racket?—Ed.) or ICAPS for short.
The purpose of ICAPS is to ensure that these vicious
attacks are stopped. To do this ICAPS needs money.
Since they have no bank account, Rag has agreed to
endorse their efforts and given ICAPS permission to
use its account — for in payments only, naturally.
Cheques, P.O.'s and cash should be sent to IC Union
Office and made payable to Imperial College Carnival
Charities account. IF you could also include your car
registration numbers, ICAPS Will make sure that these
vicious attacks on your car are stamped out.
Please be generous and help ICAPS stop these at-
tacks . . . you never know what might happen to your
automobile if you don't have ICAPS protection.

tion Society).

FELIX will shortly be
running a feature on

other Camp Counsel-

anyone who has had

please contact ROB-

Editor, since we wish
to base this article on
as wide an experience
as possible.
Thank you for your
co-operation.
Last week, in his "Presidents's Piece", Ian Mackenzie wrote about the new
Northside Hall. Now, as promised, we are reproducing below a detail from the
plans. Our diagram shows a typical flatlet, containing 6 single and 2 double
rooms with its own kitchen/dining room. There will be 35 suchflatletsin the
hall: 2 together with a common room on level 1, 4 on each of levels 2 to 9
inclusive, and 1 flat plus 2 penthouses on level 10. Lift access will be at levels
1, 6 and 10 and stairs will run to the other levels. The full plans can be seen in
the Union office.

EXHIBITIONS
1. Science in South Kensington
On a recent visit to the Lyon Playfair
Library you may have noticed the exhi-
bition "Science in South Kensington"
which is running on Level 1. The exhi-
bition commemorates the first associa-
tion of Imperial College with South
Kensington, when three departments of
the Royal School of Mines moved into
the newly built Science schools in Exhi-
bition Road during the autumn term,
1872. Eventually the building housed all
the departments of the School of Mines
and the Royal College of Science. When
Imperial College was founded in 1907
the Governors were granted the con-
tinued use of the building which be-
came called the "Huxley Building" in
1932 in recognition of T. H. Huxley's
outstanding services to the constituent
colleges: a memorial plaque was affixed
in 1933. When the Mathematics and
Meteorology departments at present
housed within it are moved to the new
building in 1974, the name will move
with them and the building will again be
used for government purposes.
The exhibition traces the history of
the School of Mines and other constitu-
ent colleges of Imperial College from
their foundation until the beginning of
the first World War, using items taken
usually from the Imperial College At",
chives. The exhibition lis arranged by the
College Archivist, Mrs. J. Pingree, who
has also compiled an excellent com-
panion catalogue. It is open until Nov-
ember 4, and is worth visiting if only
to find out what COULD be done in
the Hux.

hibition catalogue with additional mat-

2. Andrzej Kuhn's Paintings
There is at present, in the Consort
Gallery (alias the Ante-Room, College
Block) an exhibition of some 36 paint-
ings by Andrzej Kuhn. Although the
images themselves are somewhat remin-
iscent of Children's Hour, or some fairy-
tale one remembers from childhood, the
collection is colourful, bold and refresh-
ing. Like so many other painters, we see
certain "pet" themes in most of Kuhn's
works. Particularly evident are longships
similar if not identical to those of olden
days in Norway. Also present in great
numbers are huge, bright yellow, suns.
There is barely a dull colour to be seen
anywhere and the whole colour content
of the paintings falls into three categor-
ies: blocks clearly defined, patterns usu-
ally based on ia chequered design, or,
finally, blended in a way Which is like
a macroscopic view of the blending
shown by the French impressionists.
The shape of the figures portrayed is
also an interesting and important fac-
tor in the overall expression one gains
from an individual painting.
I'm sorry to say that there were no
more viewers during the time I was in
the gallery, since this relatively small ex-
hibition really is worth a visit if ever
you have five minutes to spare as you
pass through College Block — it is even
well worth a detour.
