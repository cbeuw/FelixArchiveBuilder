Letters
Boobs and
the Beeb
Dear Sir,
Surely it was a . . . .
Freudian slip when Andrew
Mafeld (letters, Oct. 24)
said of Mrs. Whitehouse
"She gave examples (of
television programmes) to-
gether with evidence of mis-
balance".
It may well be argued that
Mrs. Whitehouse exhibits
gross affectations of eccen-
tricity and that she should
not try to inflict her opinions
on everyone else. If she
wishes to have the Teasmaid
wake her at 6.30 and then
say a prayer with husband
Eric, that is her prerogative,
but when she frantically tries
to impose her illiberal,
small-minded views on the
rest of us it is tantamount to
the worst form of religious
persecution.
Why is it that Mrs. White-
house and the rest of the
Womens' Institute mob con-
centrate on the Beeb and
not towards the predominant
banality which the IBA puts
out? Why, because IBA de-
pends on advertising which
depends on large audiences
which depends on status quo
viewing and means very few
programmes outside the
mainstream of Hughie Green
and the Golden Shit.
Surely it is because the
Beeb is occasionally for-
ward thinking that the
Whitehouses of Surbiton,
facing backwards with their
middle-class heads buried in
the sand or in the latest
'Playboy', object so vehem-
ently. Hopefully her latest
outbursts of Communist-in-
spired plots will lose her the
ill - conceived credibility
which she has held in cer-
tain sections of the society.
Not content to count the
nipples displayed on the bed
she now lifts the covers and
searches for the reds under-
neath.
Yours sincerely

Mooney milk
shock increase
Sir.—On Thursday a half-
pint carton of milk (plus
cup) cost 4p from College
Block Buttery. On Friday a
cupful of milk from Moon-
ey's Milk Machine cost 3\p
—i pint cartons will no
longer be available.
Is this an inflationary in-
crease? Well, a cup holds
200 ml (-0.352 pint), if
you can keep it full. The
half-pint carton costs 4p and
at this rate the cupful should
cost 2.82p. So what's the
other 0.68p for?
I would hesitate to charge
our dear, beloved Victor with
making an excessive profit.
I • suggest that this extra
0.68p per cup must be pay-
ing for:
(a) the H.P. for this un-
necessary machine
(b) the staff to keep it
clean and filled
(c) the power to keep it
running.
Come on, Victor, let's
have our cartons back!
Yours faithfully,
P. HARRIS

Mooney meals
shock increase
Sir,—Considering the fact
that the vast majority of I.C.
students frequent at least
one of the Mooney refec-
tories at some time or other
during their stay here. I find
it rather surprising that there
has been absolutely no men-
tion at all in Felix so far this
term about the price rises
that have swept the cost of
any Mooney meal upwards.
Just about every item on
the Mooney menu has gone
up ip or in some cases 1 p.
There are no longer any
price lists on view in the
union lower refectory or the
College Block buttery, thus
students have not the oppor-
tunity to compare prices
with last year's and decide
what to buy from an econ-
omic point of view. Why do
we sometimes get charged
different amounts for the
same meal on different
days? A comprehensive ar-
ticle on the Mooney refect-
ory service, including facts
about his handling of fresh-
ers' dinners, and answering
the questions I've raised
with a complete run down of
the food prices is called for.
Since no such service was
forthcoming from 'I.C.s very
own newspaper", I have tak-
en it upon myselt as editor
of one of the C.C.U. news-
sheets to compile and pub-
lish such an article in the
next edition (Nov. 2nd.) of
the RCS Broadsheet. I hope
this article will inspire the
staff of Felix to provide simi-
lar articles of interest to all
students of the I.C. in the
not-too-distant future and
not to ignore vital issues
such as wide-spread inflation
in the College Refectories.
Yours sincerely,
RON APPLEBY
(Broadsheet Editor).
Iinstead
Scrap Heap
Sir—If certain people are to
be believed, students are
more aware than anyone else
of environmental pollution,
but the male of the species
still shows a remarkable
ability to foul his own nest.
I refer to the car park be-
hind Linstead Hall, which is
steadily accumulating a fine
selection of used car parts,
general rubbish, oil cans
(empty, or full of old engine
oil) and, inevitably, dumped
motor-cars.
My room commands a
view of this deplorable mess,
and so, to avoid offending my
eyes, as well as others,
could the people who use
the place as an open-air
workshop please remove
their own pollution when fin-
ished? I am well aware that
not all of the rubbish is the
work of hall residents, but
people can search their own
souls on that score. Surely it
is also up to the college to
provide litter-bins of some
sort? It does not require any
effort to keep the place tidy.
Yours, etc.,
D. LEACH MAN.

WITH AN
OPEN MIND
HOOT with gladness
and say forsooth
GRUNT
Although most nights are spent hammering nails
into an old, soot-covered oak table, a great deal
is to be achieved during the daytime
Rust
For anybody with a memory the length of a
sporadic hoot, the words Landsnapper and Sneeze
might well conjure up an atmosphere of nothing
happening, forgetfulness and a desire to express a
complex emotion beginning with that excellent word
" W h y " . Or, more likely, they will not mean a thing.
True. But first, before the cause is demolished by
a blast of incredible logic, consider their form.
Subtle, ain't it?
It is imperative to believe in what you say.
That the sun might NOT be shining should not
force the answer " Y e s " . But instead, a consum-
mate desire to shout " N o " should be met with
knitted eyebrows and a great deal of concentration.
Hint a little, or perhaps this will never happen
Ambrose Culpepper-Brown used to have an aero-
plane
That anybody can get away with this never
ceases to amaze me. But do not mention the words
"Space, egg and tomato filler". It is RUDE
The real purpose of these ramblings, if they are
allowed to exist—and they were commissioned as
ramblings—is to attempt to explain away the cor-
ner of the page containing the "cartoon". A bit
of background information is necessary, it was
said; to confuse, as it were. The Landsnapper
Sneeze ran for a short time last year, and what
plot there was became impossible to follow, be-
cause of the irregularity of "Felix". At that time.
So, background information, detail and a desul-
tory atmosphere follow:
Ambrose used to have an aeroplane, but Globelia
got it. Which is just the way it happened. Grounded
by Globelia, the rest of the tale involved a trek
ending up at a place called Sengemole Clapper,
where very little took place. And that was it. Many
characters were introduced, to give a reason to it
all
But, in spite of all this, it is back. And with a
message, most of the old characters, a few new
ones, including a plot, all of which only becomes
apparent at the end, as with all good mystery
stories
The orange peg-leg society for the restoration of
medieval manners, music and morbidity will go into
voluntary liquidation, on confirmation of the occa-
sional rumour propagated by the aforementioned
society
