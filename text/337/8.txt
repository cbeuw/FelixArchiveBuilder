it w o u l d be easy to take up a M a r y
Whitehouse stand a n d say that the
permissiveness of modern society is
leading to decay of society, morals,
scruples a n d a multitude of other
non-sins. Having said that, where are
the arguments to refute it? It's no
use trying to argue on the basis of
the mass-media, etc. A l l change in
society results from grass root level,
so as an IC community member, I
w o u l d like to examine some aspects
of our community, that of Imperial
College.
I remember one of the sabbatical
post candidates at the Hustings (the
last ones!) saying that there w e r e
no towels or soap dispensers in the
Union Building a n d trying to make
slight political (small 'p') meat out
of it. I'll a d d fuel to his fire; at the
moment there are no society name-
blocks for the Unon notice boards,
one broken w i n d o w in the Bot. Zoo.
c o m m o n rom, one broken w i n d o w in
the U n i o n A r c h Messengers office,
2 broken glasses on the pinball m a c h -
ines in a week, about a 10 per cent
loss of the pewter tankards in the
Union Bar, a n d someone has stolen
the T . V . aerial in the U n i o n Building.
Great. Hilarious. Of course Southside
isn't exactly m u c h better, resembling
a glorified doss-house. N o longer is
it the " n i c e " bar in college, but a
place of d i m i n i s h i n g character, style
and whatever. I c a n see someone
saying soon that it's because
the facilities aren't maintained.
A l l that means, is some silly a s s (sup-
posedly the Deputy President) run-
ning round after everyone else clean-
ing up the shit they make. Sorry
brothers, but that's not o n . Apart
from anything else, it's getting slight-
ly expensive.
To be fair, I have been one of the
main protagonists of the theory that
the number of " o u t s i d e r s " attracted
by Ents events doesn't help. I still
hold to that. However, I do not feel
the student body as a w h o l e isn't
innocent of the w h o l e affair. O f
course the student body in general
and N . U . S . in particular has been
championing the right of the i n d i v i d u -
al. It's a pity that w e as a b o d y d i d n ' t .
think of the rights of the body
itself. W e open o u r doors to more
or less anyone a n d wonder w h y the
place is getting fouled up. It's all in
the cause of freedom of the i n d i v i d -
ual or s o c i a l i s m or something. W h a t
price n o w the idea that the U n i o n
should be outward-looking? Defeat-
ism fn the face of internal problems?

Here's our new Felix cat motif. For five years now the "crusading cat" has
been our logo. He was a strange character, tacking both a tail and whiskers
— s o , knowing feline anatomy, you'll appreciate he never stood much chance
of finding any direction.
The new device, drawn especially for FELIX by Nigel Racine-Jaques,
depicts a fully-bewhiskered and tailed cat, displaying the mascots of IC's
3 constituent colleges: a Celsius/Kelvin thermometer for RCS, a singularly
useless equal-ended spanner for Guilds', and an equally useless (since it has
no screw or lighting device) Davy Lamp for Mines.
With the new device comes the promised new page one banner. The one
introduced in October last year met with a mixed reception, and the contents
of the "box", originally intended for an advertisement has been used for
various debatable messages. This box has now gone.
We hope you approve of the changes. Write and tell us what you think.

The " o p e n i n g " of the bar to w o m e n
is not in itself a b a d thing. It's just
the m e n they bring a l o n g !
Y o u see, there's a difference be-
tween I.C. w o m e n a n d their boy-
friends a n d any o l d w o m e n a n d the
boys they bring along. T h e former
come, the latter don't. (Tell me, tell
me. P . W . J . , h o w many hoppers d i d
you see today?). But, it's not just out-
siders, w e basically don't care, be-
cause w e know (I hope) s o m e b o d y
else w i l l pay. Rarely do the mass of
students get together a n d sling out,
or keep out troublemakers. It's a l -
most as if w e condone the damage
and v a n d a l i s m , or even participate in
it. W e l l if that's the " m a n d a t e " the
Deputy President has, he c a n hardly
be a c c u s e d of allowing the U n i o n
and Southside to attain " e q u i l i b -
r i u m " . B y the w a y , the society name-
blocks, T . V . aerial, towels, soap, etc.
w i l l a l l be replaced after term has
finished, ready for next year's fresh-
ers. I just hope they appreciate it, be-
cause looking back o n this year, quite
honestly, w e didn't. For G o d ' s sake,
I.C., respect a n d take care of what
w e ' v e got, it's no use saying if w e
had better facilities, w e w o u l d look
after it, because that is patently not
the case. Gone are the days of a
good piss-up, g o o d sing song, in the
Union Bar a n d no damage, with
Southside a place for people wanting
a good, not rowdy bar. Here are
the days of a lousy piss-up, lousy
sing-song, leaving the U n i o n in a
mess, w i t h Southside a human jungle,
occasional lousy sing-song a n d doss-
house.
Cheers, but where?

P.S. I've heard talk of turning the
D.P. role into a more political one.
I'm in t w o m i n d s whether to be in
favour (Defeatism) or to contract an
ulcer (Extremely justified pessi-
m i s m ) . W i t h a l l this talk of the e n -
vironment I'm just waiting for some-
one to cotton o n . T h i is your environ-
ment, O U R S ; w e want control of it,
and that means control it ourselves,
and that means ( D o I have to spell
it out?) S.E.L.F. C . O . N . T . R . O . L .
