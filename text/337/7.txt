CHICKEN FEED
—and what the N U S (and ICU) proposes to do about it
On Saturday representatives of 600,000 stu-
dents, members of 600 student unions, will
descend on Imperial College for the NUS Ex-
traordinary Conference on Grants.
The Conference, called by the Easter National Con-
ference at Exeter, has to decide what action the NUS
should now take in view of the recent government
award of a flat £20 increase in the mandatory grant
level, and reductions in parental contributions for
parents with "residual income" of less than £1,900.
The Government offer
represents only 20 per
cent of the increase de-
manded by the National
U n i o n of Students, and
other demands have been
completely ignored.
1. N o action has been
taken on discretionary
awards. These are the
grants paid to students at,
for example, technical col-
leges and colleges of fur-
ther education and, unlike
those paid to university and
polytechnic students, have
no fixed level. The amount
of grant paid is left to the
"disretion" of the local
education authority, and is
thus almost always very
much less than the manda-
tory level. The usual
parental contribution sale
applies.
Since students on discre-
tionary awards have been
among the most active i n
the grants campaign that
has been running since De-
cember, the lack of govern-
ment reaction to this de-
mand has come as a
severe blow to N U S hopes.
The conference will cer-
tainly be as angry as stu-
dents on discretionary
awards, and this claim will
almost certainly now come
top of the list of next year's
demands.
Easter conference did
mandate the N U S Execu-
tive not to accept any in-
crease in the mandatory
level of grants until discre-
tionary awards are abo-
ished. However, the N U S
will have its work cut out
if it is to try and persuade
.students to send back their
£20 increase.
2. Abolition of the
means test. A l l the Govern-
ment has actually done is
abolish contributions for
parents with residual in-
comes less than £1,500,
and reduce them for i n -
comes less than £1,900. N o
signs at all have been
forthcoming of the aboli-
tion of parental contribu-
tions and with it the means
test.
3. Married women's
grants. Although Norman
St. John Stevas said earlier
this year that he was "sym-
pathetic" to the case of
married women students—
they get only £275 — all
•he has done for them is
award them the flat £20
increase that other, single,
students are getting.
The mood of the con-
ference is bound to be
angry. It opens on the
morning of Saturday, 9th
June, in our very own
Great Hall, which Coun-
cil agreed to pay for as
I C U ' s contribution to-
wards the cost of the con-
ference. It, will be fully
covered in F E L I X on
Tuesday, June 12th, with
informed comment from
leading N U S policy ana-
lysts.
I C U n i o n has submitted
its own motion for the
conference. This — it is
reproduced below — will
be "composited" with mo-
tions from other colleges
all over Britain, at a
meeting in L o n d o n on
June 7th, and a giant
catholic motion presented
to conference on the 9th.
So, herewith, the text of
I C U ' s motion: —
Motion on Grants of
Imperial College Union
for the NUS Emergency
Conference of June 1973
A . C O N F E R E N C E
N O T E S
1. The Government's de-
cision of 15th May to
increase grants by £20
next year in addition
to the £20 decided in
1971, and the raising
of the floor of the
means test to £1500 a
year parental income.
2. The lack of any at-
tempt to remove the
basic injustices of the
grants system, i.e., dis-
cretionary awards, dis-
crimination against
married women, no
London allowance for
post-graduates, and
the means test.
3. The complete lack of
any move to introduce
full cash grants in col-
leges of education.
4. The continuation of
the full mandatory
rate at an amount far
below that adequate
for a decent standard
of living.
5. That the Government
announcement in no
way meets our demands
from the Exeter Con-
ference.
6. That given the rate of
inflation since the last
triennial review, the
"new" rates, far from
representing a step to-
wards our claim, rein-
forces the present situ-
ation and perpetuates
it.
7. The recent victimisa-
tion and threatened
court action against
rent strikers, e.g., jr«
Reading University, j
8. That post-graduates
are the only section of
students and Univer-
sity staff not to receive
a London Weighting
to cover the undisput-
ed higher cost of living
in London. Also for
post-graduates in gen-
eral, the increase of
£20, amounting to
only 38p a week, post-
graduates having to
live for 52 on their
grants.
B. P O L I C Y A N D
C A M P A I G N
1. Conference therefore
entirely rejects the
Government " offer" %
It sees no basis what-
soever to discontinue
or dilute our campaign
for £105 increase and
full grants for all in
full time higher educa-
tion.
2. Conference, however,
sees no point in in-
structing members not
to take any extra
money due to them.
This is impractical.
3. Conference, however,
believes that whereas
well argued memos
from NUS were ig-
nored, militant action
by the mass of stu-
dents has forced an
interim review and
won some concessions.
4. May 21st should not
be regarded as the last
possible day by which
the Government can
decide to meet the
NUS claim since
money can always
come from the central
government funds in-
stead of LEA's. In
particular, since PG
grants come direct
from central govern-
ment funds the excuse
of LEA and parlia-
mentary bureaucracy
is even less valid.
5. NUS should maintain
and defend the cam-
paign, e.g., rent strikes
this term and rapidly
extend it, right from
the start of Autumn
term.
6. NUS and CO's should
use the summer vaca-
tion for organisation
and preparation of ex-
planatory campaign
material aimed at
first year students uti-
lising freshers fairs,
new students mailings,
NUS introductory
material.
7. In particular, much
more emphasis should
be put on explaining
the evils of discretion-
ary awards to all stu-
dents.
8. National Demonstra-
tions and a Day of Ac-
tion should be orga-
nised in England, Ire-
land, Scotland and
Wales on the same
Thursday in October.
These should aim to
unite the different sees
tions of the campaign
in a massive lift-off at
the beginning of term.
9. The campaign should
employ all the tactics
successfully employed
to date — namely,
catering boycotts, pick-
ets, lobbies, publicity
campaigns, occupa-
tions, strikes; to be
backed up by and ex-
tended from the na-
tional demonstration
in a co-ordinated way.
10. NUS Executive should
not participate in the
Triennial Review next
year unless the Gov-
ernment indicates that
all the Campaign's de-
mands will be con-
sidered.
11. The particularly acute
problems faced by
post grads should be
given more emphasis,
but this requires orga-
nisation of PG's at
both college and na-
tional level. NUS
Exec, should convene
a conference of PG af-
fairs officers and acti-
vists to elect a Nation-
al PG Committee, ini-
tiate action on grants
including demonstrat-
ing boycotts, lobbies
and other activities.
Although PG's should
be organised by stu-
dent unions we should
work for good rela-
tion with AST MS
groups where these
exist.
12. Students must give
greater priority to
seeking support from
the labour movement;
who face the same
enemy in their fight
against wage freeze
and anti-union legisla-
tion. We must seek
more than verbal sup-
port but joint actions,
leafleting, pickets, de-
monstrations in sup-
• port of higher grants,
to this end NUS Exe-
cutive should prepare
"An Appeal to the
Labour Mo vement
which would present
the students' case,
highlight discrimina-
tion against the work-
ing class and further
education and ask for
support for some con-
crete campaigning ac-
tivity with local stu-
dent union. Unions
could then approach
in a co-ordinated way,
Trade Councils, Trade
Union .branches, shop
stewards, committees
to organise joint ac-
tions. To launch^ this
aspect of the compaign
there should be a "Na-
tional Week of Expla-
nation" of the issue of
grants to the working
class. Also NUS
should organise, on a
national scale a con-
ference to organise
students' support in
the event of a large
workers' s t r u ggle
against the Pay Laws
and the government
(e.g. over the engineers'
claim).
13. Conference believes
that more emphasis
should be put on ex-
plaining that the prob-
lems of inflation faced
by students are shared
by workers, Old Age
Pensioners, etc.A and
that the Government
must bear responsibi-
lity for this inflation,
e.g. land speculation,
cut-backs in social
services, VAT, agri-
cultural policy, float-
ing the pound. The ef-
fects of low grants, the
means test, and the
discretionary awards
system in exluding
working class child-
ren from sigher edu-
cation should be
stressed more with a
view to winning work-
ing class support.
Workers are finding
that due to inflation
their nominal increase
in income has led to
an increase in parental
contribution despite
apparent changes in
rate.
14. Conference recognises
that we are very limit-
ed in our influence on
the Press and that a
campaign geared to
winning over the mass
media has serious in-
adequacies.
15. Conference believes
that active antf auto-
matic support by the
NUS Exec, to all rent
strikes, teaching or
catering boycotts, oc-
cupations, democrati-
cally decided on by
CO's in the context of
this campaign, is es-
sential for this cam-
paign.
16. Conference calls on all
CO's to immediately
report to Exec, any
such actions and calls
for a weekly list of all
such activities to be
distributed to all CO's.
17. Since this Conference
has been called in ac-
cordance with Exeter
Conference policy,
which called for deci-
sions on the basis of
Union mandates, this
conference must not
retreat from any pre-
vious policies unless
such mandates have
been given.
18. Conference affirms the
Exeter decision that
the Grants campaign
would be maintained
until discretionary
awards had been abo-
lished.
C. R E N T S T R I K E S
1. Conference recognises
the key role being
played in the Cam-
paign by those colleges
on rent strikes. Con-
ference calls for the
continuation of rent
strike activity until our
claim is met.
2. Conference deplores
the threats of victimi-
sation (legal and aca-
demic) used by VC's
and Principals in their
attacks on rent strikes.
3. Conference believes
that the best way to
counter such threats of
is to fight them on our
own ground, in the col-
leges, Conference un-
• equivocally supports
all actions such as par-
tial or total, short or
medium-term occupa-
tions, as a means to
counter such threats.
In this respect Confer-
ence wholeheartedly
congratulates those
colleges which have
already embarked on
such action; the suc-
cessful defence of rent
strikes is a tremendous
achievement for the
whole campaign. Any
successful action, such
as that at Bristol Uni-
versity, gives incalcu-
lable encouragement to
others and must be
publicised as widely as
possible.
4. Conference recognises
that the law does not
automatically attack
students active in the
campaign but has to
be used by College au-
thorities, etc. Further
Conference believes
that the decisions of
the courts will be in-
fluenced primarily out-
side the courts rather
than by legal argu-
ments; therefore i. In
the face of legal
threats NUS and CO's
should firstly take
widespread action
aimed at discouraging
the College Authori-
ties from using the law.
ii. If cases do get to
the court then hearings
should be accom-
panied by massive na-
tionally organised
action.
