ROWING
T h e 12th and 19th of M a y are two dates which will
long be remembered by nine members of Imperial C o l -
lege, for they bracket a week of success for I . C . B . C on
a scale which has not been enjoyed for many years.
Saturday 12th saw I.C.'s already reported victory in the
U . L . A l l a n C u p . O n Thursday, 17th the I.C. 1st and
2nd VIII's were on show at the Metropolitan Regatta
at Putney. This regatta, which is held over 3 days, is
one of the oldest and most impressive in the country. In
the semi-final of the Senior A VIII's, I.C.'s opponents
were E m m a n u e l School. A disastrous unpractised start
from the stake boats saw I.C. | L down very quickly.
However, the long zoom course gave I.C. plenty of time
to gather themselves and row powerfully through the
school to win by £L.
Meanwhile the 2nd V I I I went straight into the final
of the Senior C event against Nat. West B a n k and
Twickenham. After taking an early lead of J L I.C.
were disqualified for steering into one of the other
crews. It was later found that I.C. had lost the fin off
their boat.
In the final of the Senior A VIIIs, I.C. rowed against
Putney T o w n and their old adversaries L o n d o n R . C .
I.C. went off the start at 40 and soon pulled out f L lead
over London. This lead was maintained as they drop-
ped to 38 at the mile post and just touched 36 at Barn
Elms. Putney were well out of it by this time but L o n -
don attacked coming towards the Black Buoy. In the
last minute the I.C. lead varied between ^ L . and a can-
vas. A s strokes eyes glazed over he made one last des-
perate attempt hold off London, and since for once a l l
the rest of the crew were with h i m he succeeded. W i t h
the rate at 42 I.C. crossed the line ^ L in front of L o n -
don.
The celebrations were not as prolonged as usual, be-
cause two days later three I.C. V I I I travelled to Thames
B
Ditton to take part in the regatta there. The Novice
V I I I had their first race on the Friday night and after
leading for most of the way, were unlucky to lose by 3
feet. The 2nd V I I I unfortunately had to scratch as they
were a man short.
The 1st V I I I were again rowing Senior A and their
first round opponents were Barclays Bank. A very
poor row over a very short course saw them scramble
to an unconvincing ^ L win. In the semi-final they met
the powerful Kingston R . C . T h e 1st V I I I , who are
not slow off the start, were left standing by Kingston,
who by halfway, were just clear. What happened next
is uncertain as everybody at this stage thought that
Kingston would win. In the next minute the I.C. boat
probably moved faster than it has done before and
Kingston, who were nowhere near as fit as I.C., despite
their length lead, never stood a chance. I.C. went right
through them to win by ^ L . The time recorded in this
race was the fastest of the day by some 8 seconds.
The outcome of the final against Vesta R . C . was
never in much doubt as I.C. had dealt savagely with
them in training. Rowing well within themselves. I.C.
won by 2 L .
In the next few weeks I.C. will be appearing at the
following Regattas. June 2nd—Chiswick, June 9th W a l -
ton, June 16th (Internal regatta) Putney, June 24, M a r -
low and June 26th to July 7 (Racing 4th to 7th) at H e n -
ley. A n y support would be welcome.
GLIDER SMASH
Ace IC glider pilot
Mike Alexander brought
I C U Gliding Club's first
accident to pass when he
crash-landed the other
week.
The glider is now to
be rebuilt, since this will
save a considerable s u m
over the purchase price
of a replacement. C o u n -
cil agreed at its meeting
on M o n d a y to grant
£200 to cover the differ-
ence between the insured
value a n d cost of re-
b u i l d i n g . The insurance
c o m p a n y have agreed to
pay the full s u m insured
less £25 excess and
allow ICU G l i d i n g C l u b
to salvage the wreck-
age.
A s C o u n c i l pointed
out, the gliders are ob-
viously under-insured,
and steps are now being
taken to correct this.
M I S F I R E
The purchase of a . 2 2
automatic pistol was
again deferred by C o u n -
cil, pending further in-
vestigations by the A t h -
letics Clubs Committee.
M a n y uses were found
by C o u n c i l for this
weapon, and M a r t i n
Black has volunteered
for target practice.
