swindle.
I.C. professors have
suorisanb Bui|e8A8j U33c
in the forthcoming I.C.
examinations to c a l l -
girls, writes Sinia H o c h -
ayelnthenoo. A sinister
group of call-girls calling
themselves C r a s s Pros-
titutes of Brixton {Most-
ly Lesbians) — c o m -
monly shortened t o
C P B ( M L ) — have been
offering their services to
I.C. professors a n d sen-
ior lecturers.
They have h a d espe-
cial s u c c e s s i n enticing
Emetical Engineering
staff t o their " p e r s o n a l
tutorials". T h e E . E . d e -
partment is well-known
for its strong belief i n
A s s o c i a t e d Studies, a n d
the professors have been
keenly s u b s c r i b i n g to the
French lessons that t h e
C P B ( M L ) offers.
The organisation cat-
ers f o r the staff of every
department of Improb-
able College. A n e w
group w h o operate i n
plastic imitation s u e d e
and leather garments is
having great s u c c e s s
with C h i m p i s t r y profs.
O n c e the C P B ( M L )
Call-Girls have s e d u c e d
the profs, they use tech-
niques acquired of their
special training school in
Albania to extract top-
secret classified examin-
ation questions from t h e
profs.
I traced the heirarchy
of the organisation back
to " M a d a m e " , the ruth-
less, fearless G o d m o t h e r
of the C P B ( M L ) .
Her name i s M a d a m e
Shillong. S h e operates
from a stunning, a w e -
inspiring a n d quite
frightfully ghastly n e o -
Betjeman residence in
K i n g ' s Stile, W . S . 0 0 7 ^ .
Her telephone number
is 9 9 9 5 1 1 1 , a n d her
codename is " E m e r -
g e n c y " . Y o u ' l l find it i n
eve.y telephone direc-
tory — a n d , s h o u l d y o u
forget it, o n every tele-
phone dial.
There a r e five code-
words. S a y four of them
-—Police, A m b u l a n c e ,
Fire or C o a s t g u a r d — a n d
you m a y e n d up in gaol.
Say ' M A D A M E ' a n d
you will e n d up in b e d
— c u r l e d u p w i t h a vol-
uptuous w h o r e — r e v e a l -
ing a l l your secrets ( a n d ,
if y o u are a professor,
your examination ques-
tions.)
I went through the
rigorous framing neces-
sary to b e c o m e o n e of
M a d a m e S h i l l o n g ' s
young a n d nubile m a i d -
ens, so I c o u l d reveal
the true facts to FEEL-
SICK readers.
M y first assignment
was a Professor of Phy-
sical Science. H e seem-
ed more concerned with
the ' p h y s i c a l ' than the
' s c i e n c e ' — but, using
M a d a m e ' s techniques, I
s u c c e e d e d in gleaning
vital information about
the P h y s i c a l S c i e n c e 1st
year examination for
F E E L S I C K readers.
The professor — M r .
' X ' to h i s friends — re-
vealed that it w o u l d be
necessary to know the
atomic weight of hydro-
gen, a n d also revealed
his arms, chest, legs,
feet a n d . . . (cont. p. 9 4 )
But the C P B ( M L ) is
not the only organisation
of its kind, writes A .
P I E R S T C O - B E L I E S .
One of the most sinis-
ter is " Y o u n g , Saucy a n d
Sexy S y l p h s " ( Y S S S ) —
a youth group affiliated
to a parent organisation
called " S e n i l e Love-mak-
ing L i m i t e d " (SLL). A n -
other is the " I n c u m b e n t
M a i d e n s G r o u p " ( I M G ) .
There are, of course,
more respectable organ-
isations, a n d o n e o f the
greatest is the C P G B —
" C a p a b l e Partners for
Girls a n d B o y s " . T h i s
latter o n e h a s been es-
pecially successful in
infiltrating t h e N U S
executive. Another of
the groups — the Y S S S
— h a s been having s o m e
s u c c e s s w i t h student
union officers. It has a
strong stake i n K i n g ' s
College London, a n d a
prominent member of the
FELIX staff is also a
member.

Two poems
W A T E R G A T E M U D
A r e they proud of their flag
A n d the w a y that it flies
W h e n the stripes on it s a g
A n d the stars emit lies?
They are proud of their flag
A n d the w a y that it flies
If the Press has n o g a g
A n d D e m o c r a c y tries.
A S P E L L IN T H E C O U N T R Y
Leave London's stress a n d strain confined
To tensive pressures left behind,
Then let the country scenes remind
The town to trust in H u m a n k i n d
Let cities seek the rural kind
Of aura they can s e l d o m find.
W h e r e Faith and Purpose seem enshrined
W i t h i n the W h i s p e r s of the m i n d .
