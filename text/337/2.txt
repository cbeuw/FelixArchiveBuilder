Letters to the Editor
Sir.
It was with the deep-
est feeling of regret that
I read the tale of the sad
demise of Mr. Ron Ap-
pleby and his missing
400 copies of Broad-
sheet ghosted away dur-
ing the night. The very
thought of such a perver-
sion of literary genius
mnakes my eyes fill with
tears and my breast
heave with sorrow. And
as I stop to wring out my
shirt may I offer him my
sincere condolences.
Unfortunately being
away from college on the
night concerned I can-
not offer any light as to
who were the perpetra-
tors of this dastardly
crime but I suggest Mr.
Applepie should cheer
up. After all he should
feel heartened that in at
least one fan of Broad-
sheet who is not only
content with his quota of
1 copy but wants the
whole satisfaction of
400! (a potential £4.00
worth—rotten jews). It
is remarkable Mr. Apple-
pie has not called in the
police to investigate this
rotten felony. Is he hid-
ing something? Is he
covering up? Could our
introverted friend in a
sudden fit of puritanical
frenzy have flung the
whole damn lot down the
College incinerator.
We must wait and see
if these call-girls mean
the downfall of our est-
eemed editorial collea-
gue after such an ad-
mission of incompe-
tence. After all Guild-
sheet has no distribution
problems with its 700
plus fun-filled copies:
even complete with full
frontal covers.
Which reminds me Mr.
Dowson; what about the
distribution of your glor-
ious Felix. In days of
yore when I arrived for
first lecture on a Tues-
day there used to be a
pile of mint Felixes (or
is it Felices) waiting for
me. Now not even com-
ing into lectures at all I
can scarcely find a copy
of Felix anywhere any-
time on the appointed
Tuesdays. Is this Sabba-
tical efficiency?
Yours sincerely,
Charles M. Wrigley
Editor, Guildsheet.
Sir,
Whilst in the union
office recently, I happen-
ed on a copy of SEN-
NET. This is, of course,
the Journal of the Uni-
versity of Lpndon Union.
I was immediately struck
by the finely set out col-
umns, the quality and
number of its illustra-
tions, the superb nature
of its up to date and ex-
tremely relevant news-
reports, all with percep-
tive and witty editorial
comment. The sports
page, to which I do not
usually cast my eyes in
the National Dailies, at-
tracted me immediately.
The contributors would
do justice to the back
pages of the Observer. I
wondered who could it
be that was architecting
such a literary pearl.
Investigation as to the
identity of this Beaver-
brook of Malet Street re-
vealed that the post was
being filled on a part
time basis by a person
who is registered at this
college. Surely I thought
such Talent could work
wonders as editor of
our humble Organ, FEL-
IX. Could we not provide
him with a sabbatical al-
lowance and, giving him
a free hand, sit back and
enjoy the benefits of his
efforts. Ih my estimation,
considering the nature
of his achievements on
SENNET, a mere three
hours, per issue, of his
time should be suffi-
cient. He would then be
free to do whatever he
wanted. Perhaps edit the
Times, or Punch or per-
haps squeeze his black-
heads.
Should anyone wish
to make the Sennet edi-
tor an offer, he can be
contacted in the Felix
Office. Just ask for Oily
Dowson.
Yours,
R. LI. Loltey (Tariq)
Sir,
Following the recent
trend of Felix (editor)
bashing I would like to
propose some construc-
tive ideas as to how the
union may obtain value
for money both from
Felix and the 3rd sab-
batical officer (Felix edi-
tor).
I would like to see the
post of Felix editor and
publicity officer combin-
ed and elevated to exe-
cutive level. This would
I believe mean that the
editor has a more detail
knowledge of what is
happening in this col-
lege and thus help pro-
mote events. Felix then
might even carry up to
date reports, pictures
and news. I believe that
this would enable the
less active members of
the union to identify
themselves with a union
which does, despite its
lack of publicity, have
one hell of a lot going
on.
I have specified that
the editor should have
executive level respon-
sibility to try to elimin-
ate the alienation which
has occurred this year
between the editor and
union. The exec must
work as a team on Felix
because it is THEIR
newspaper to represent
the activities and inter-
ests of the union. It
could also eliminate
problems such as re-
sponsibility for distribu-
tion so that the wretch-
ed rag does not lie
around the union office
for days, as happened
to the last issue.
Finally I would like
to emphasise that it is
the responsibility of
clubs and societies to
send reports to Felix,
and the editor should de-
vote more time to chas-
ing such news, rather
than obtaining the more
obscure type of articles
we have seen this year.
Malcolm Newman
P.S. — Congratulations
Mr. (broadsheet) Apple-
by on publically admit-
ting that res exec are
' exceedingly childish '
(Felix No. 336).
* The Editor will be giv-
ing his own views on
how the FELIX editor-
ship should be run in the
next issue, which will be
the last this year.
Dear Sir,
In the name of Chris-
tianity, Mr. Veall has
shown the Church is
bent. He has shown
nothing bent about
Christianity.
In the name of Marx-
ism, it is obvious that
Russia et al is not ex-
actly straight. Nothing
has been shown "not
straight" about Marx-
ism.
As a follower of nei-
ther doctrines, and hav-
ing little faith in either,
may I wish upon both,
an adaptation of an old
showbiz expression:—
"Kindly leave the page".
Yours faithfully,
P. W. Jowitt.

P r e s i d e n t ' s P i e c e
PRICES
Although Friday's Finance a n d Executive C o m -
mittee's of IC's Governing B o d y heard a r e c o m -
mendation from the Secretary of the College M r .
Davies for a 5 per cent increase in Refectory prices,
the final decision will not taken until the full meet-
ing of Governors at the e n d of J u n e . T h e U n i o n
observers put the case for no increase arguing
that the £20 additional increase in grant cannot be
regarded as an excuse for a l l o w i n g further infla-
tion. S i n c e all colleges a n d universities are faced
with similar deficits if they refuse to put up prices
a n d deliberately breach the U . G . C . (i.e. Govern-
ment) regulations then the Government w i l l have
to give w a y a n d either s u b s i d i s e refectories or bet-
ter still increase grants to such a level that w e c a n
afford the e c o n o m i c price for a m e a l . Apparently
the Committee of V i c e - C h a n c e l l o r s a n d Principals
are considering some joint action but whether it
is the sort of firm stand that w e have asked for
is another matter.
On the brighter side the increases w o u l d not
take place until the beginning of next session when
it w o u l d be easier to mount some resistance to
them whereas at the beginning of August this w o u l d
be well-nigh impossible.
V A C A T I O N FIELD C O U R S E S
Over the last f e w months the union has made
representations to the College about the financial
hardship incurred by students having field courses
during their vacations. A typical Geology student
might lose £110 because hotel bills are around £3
a night w h i l e the subsistence grant is only £1.20
(£200 in potential earnings in vacation over 3
years).
The Rector's reaction w a s to circularise Heads of
Departments with guidance that where possible they
should take all financial arrangements for travel,
board a n d lodgings out of students' hands so that
no hardship s h o u l d arise. If this w a s not possible
the previous situation w o u l d apply. A t first sight a
substantial victory but w o u l d the finance be avail-
able?
The money available w o u l d increase from
£24,000, the U . G . C s . amount to £30,000 but, what
if this w a s not enough? T h e departments c o u l d
c l a i m that for financial reasons it w a s not " p o s -
s i b l e " to make a l l the arrangements themselves,
and the students w o u l d be left exactly as before.
A t Friday's F & E meeting the Rector d i d give some
assurances. Departments c a n take money from
other sources to supplement the money earmarked
for field courses. A l s o the Rector d i d believe that
there w o u l d be no hardship this s u m m e r a n d if
there w a s going to be any he wanted to know. W e
have proposed that the s u m allocated s h o u l d be
based on a survey of field course needs rather than
an arbritrary figure b u t in the short term if y o u
are going to be left out of pocket because of a
field course get onto your Departmental Rep. o r
myself, n o w .
I N S U R A N C E
Next session if you have an accident in College
you w i l l have automatic insurance cover. T h i s has
arisen from representations to the College from the
the P / G Committee about this issue. T h e final de-
tails have not yet been settled but a typical policy
covering both post a n d under graduates might give
£1000 for death or loss of limb or eyes, or £10 per
week for 2 years for a less permanent injury.
