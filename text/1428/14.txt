“The Life Of
Galileo”
Dramsoc presents its main
Spring Show: Brecht’s “The
Life of Galileo” (trans. Charles

Galileo’s proof that the Earth re-
volves around the Sun changed
the way people saw the world
forever. One of the greatest
scientific breakthroughs, it was
also seen as dangerous and
potentially heretical.

of Galileo” is one of Brecht’s
best known plays. It exam-
ines the conflict between free
enquiry and official ideology
and contains some of Brecht’s
most human and complex
characters.

in advance from:

Coffee Break
T
his week me and the
friends I will be living
with next year finally got
together to sort out what
the heck we want from
our house. It’ll most likely be a house
as there are five of us living under one
roof. Now unless we wanted to share
rooms in a confined space such as the
immigrants that share small sheds in
the back gardens of Slough, a house is a
good option. Only problem is, we need
to find a 5 bedroom house now. Any-
who, point is we got off our arses and
had a house meeting. It was a nervous
affair, as we have never had a house
meeting before, and as this was our
first one, we had no clue about what
we wanted.
Let me deviate here and tell you a
few things. That comment about the
people of Slough is true. Trust me, I
was brought up there. Also let me tell
you now, my house next year with the
people I will live with (and I love these
guys) will be the most dysfunctional
house ever. Everyone in it is a complete
waster.
Well after much discussion and long
deliberation, we came out with a few
good conclusions, important when
deciding things for your new house/

flat. The most important one in my
book was the fact we are going to get
a dog! For real, loads of people say they
are going to get a pet of some kind. We
have agreed and in fact planned out the
way to ascertain our dog.
What may be important to others
include; the price your willing to pay,
location, local amenities and comforts
for the house hold. In our case I think
we want a house somewhere in Fulham,
near Fulham Broadway, at aproximate-
ly £170 a week per person including ex-
penses such a phone, gas and electric-
ity. And of course SKY+!!! You can get
a pretty decent all in one package from
them which includes SKY, Broadband
and phone. SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!
All in all I am really looking forward
to next year, being in halls has been
fun, however there is something about
your own place where you make your
own rules, you have your own personal
space. You don’t have to worry about
tiny fridges, or people steeling you
food and cutlery.
I hope that this week I have got
you thinking about your living situa-
tion next year. So good luck and good
hunting.
