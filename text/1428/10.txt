Music
Music Editors – Peter Sinclair, Alex Ashford & James Houghton
I have, up until recently, been a fol-
lower of dance music and rave culture,
preferring to have wild-eyed fun amid
frantic light shows as psytrance, hard-
house or drum‘n’bass ensue. Although
I have, since childhood, enjoyed and
loved dearly bands in which real instru-
ments are played and words sung (Led
Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and the Stones to
name a few of the more obvious ones),
I had never really experienced ‘rock’
music in a live context. Now, this seems
both surprising and a shame, given just
how many groups and artists there are
out there showcasing their, often ex-
ceptional, talent only a tube ride away
and on most nights a week.
It is amazing how much beautiful
music falls on ‘deaf’ ears if chart sales
are to go by: with so much talent it is
amazing so little of it makes it into the
hit parade. The three acts I saw last
Wednesday at the ICA would fall into
this category.
Mumford & Sons
and Alessi’s Ark
Caroline Knight
Caz Knight reviews the folky bluegrass delights of Mumford
& Sons playing brand new material, with support from Alessi’s
Ark and Sons of Noel and Adrien at the ICA last wednesday.
Mumford and Sons have been one
of my most listened-to bands since my
boyfriend flicked on their Myspace last
October (his friend, Winnie, plays ban-
jo). It seems as if St Paul’s School has
been a nucleation centre for a number
of bands emerging as part of the Lon-
don folk scene, producing the likes of
Noah and the Whale and the lesser
known Cherbourg.
The raw, rasping and sexy-voiced
singer Marcus also used to drum for
singer Laura Marling (who made an
appearance on the night, albeit as a
spectator) but now leads the Sons with
an incredible energy. An energy that
is sustained throughout every amaz-
ing song, each one possessing a cer-
tain magic; be it in melody, lyrics or
the good old fashioned thrashing of
the banjo with a fitting hoedown to go
with – truly stompable stuff. As well as
old favourites such as ‘Little Lion Man’,
‘Feel the Tide’ and ‘White Blank Page’,
we were treated to new tunes such as
the opening ‘Sigh No More’ and ‘The
Cave’, their performance doing nothing
short of making me fall deeper in love
with them!
Alessi’s Ark and Sons of Noel and
Adrian were the glorious supporting
acts which matched the Sons for tal-
ent and were wholly unique. Alessi
was probably the youngest person
at the ICA that night (being only 18)
and charmed us with her quiet man-
ner and her confusion between Heston
Blumenthal and emmental cheese. Not
only did her songs send shivers down
the spine (with lines like: “I want to
walk around in your beautiful head/
And hang photographs from your
wicker bed”) but her voice set her apart
from any other female soloist around
at the moment (think Bjork crossed
with Dolores O’Riordan of the Cran-
berries). Alessi’s Ark is back in London
at the end of the month after a stint in
California.
The other Sons of the night (those
of Noel and Adrian) stood ten strong
with an assortment of instruments
(flute, horn, double bass, violin, cello
to name a few, as well as some syn-
chronised whistling to go with) which
reminded me of a sort of hillbilly-von-
Trapp-family band, in the best possible
way. As far as I am aware, the band
members are not related. Special men-
tion must go to the violin player, the
majority of whose violin’s strings were
freed from their bow on account of his
energetic playing!
Certainly, Sons of Noel and Adrian
are loved by the headlining Sons and
for good reason too.
This is music at its most heartfelt,
modest and organic, but gives you
something which can’t be recreated
with synths and basslines through
speakers. Give me folk over rave any
day.
