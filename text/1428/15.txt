Basically, you get points for doing all the various puzzles and chal-
lenges, and at the end of the year, the winning team and the win-
ning individual will win an iPod nano! The scoring is as follows:
5 points for the first correct answers for Slitherlink, Wordoku, Lon-
don Underground, Mentalist Maze and Quickie. 4 points for second,
3 points for third, 2 points for fourth and 1 point for fifth.
Double points will be awarded for correct cryptic crossword an-

Simple! Now then FUCWITs, send in your answers to felix@impe-

Teams:
Horoscopes as they should be- By A. Mazing
Ohai guyz. How’s it been without me? I am back to deliver you some factual ‘sopes. Watch out Rugby
Virgo
So you took the
Chlamydia test this
week in the Union.
Next week the re-
sults come back. You
are expectant that
it’ll be negative. Humm nope. I don’t think so.
You have a whole host of other unconventional
diseases such as liking Phil Collins. I only hope
the Rugby boys don’t find out because they
hate Collins, and they’ll ‘find you’. Ohhhhh
Scorpio
You are most probably
reading this in a
lecture. Which is
good. Now look to
the person to the left
of you. Now look to
the person to the right. Now glancing round
the lecture theatre and look at 12 other people.
Statistics show that one of you will get raped.
Tasty. I do hope that it’s you and that you get
pregnant. That’ll be laughable.
Libra
A couple of week
ago I introduced you
to the word ‘chunt’.
I was a creation of
mine which cropped
up in conversation.
Lets just say that if you are Chinese and a cunt
you could possibly be a chunt. If you are a
cunt, but not Chinese, then no, you cannot be
a chunt. If you need further explanation then
you are a cunt. Whatever ethnic origin.
Capricorn
Sabb this Sabb that
Sabb the other. Here’s
an idea. Why don’t
you all go and fuck
yourselves? I think
that will be a far better
use of your time, and be far better for my anger.
I hate you all and plan on voting for RON. The
next person who gives me a sweetie will find it
inserted into their rectum. It will require surgical
removal. Go jump into the Thames. Pint?
Sagittarius
YOU! Stop reading
this and do some shit.
Since when were you
worthy for reading
such a fine paper? Ask
the guy next to you to
roll it up and repeatedly hit you with it until you
face looks like Rihanna’s. Too far? Not fucking
likely. If you can’t do the business with the paper,
come get a sledgehammer from me, that’ll mess
up a face like no other.
Cancer
Rape, arse hole
splitting, bruises,
blood, gnome stuck
in your eye, rose
jammed down your
japs eye, cum all
over you head, parts of your ball sack missing,
bits of your vagina dragging along the floor,
pregnancy, broken limbs, people laughing,
rocks being thrown. Nope nothing good for you
is planned this week.
Gemini
This week you go
out and buy some
ridiculous clothing
in the hope that you
will be accepted by
you peer group. Well,
no, you will never be accepted. I suggest you go
back to the monkeys where they worship you
as some sort of God. However, back in the real
world having a conversation with you is like
kicking a cripple, it’s just not right.
Leo
Oh so Rugby don’t
like me. Well look
at my face... does
it look bothered? I
shall enlighten you,
it doesn’t. Go back
to chasing eggs and occasionally touching other
balls. I say occasionally, that’s forgetting the gay
love in the post-match showers. We all know
you love it. Feel free to replace ‘it’ with a range
of words e.g. ‘frotting’.
Taurus
So you have decided
to stand for the
editor of this fine
ass paper. You
dicksplat. What do
you hope to achieve?
A cheeky shag in the back room does not come
guaranteed with the job you know. I hope
you fail in such a way that as you walk round
campus people laugh and throw faeces at you.
Hopefully some will land in your mouth too.
Aries
You are absolutely
horrific. It is not
legal have sexual
intercourse with
a 15 year old. I do
not care that she
‘looked older’ or was ‘well up for it’ you just
can’t do it. Now you are going to be shipped of
to jail where they hate kiddy fiddlers. You’ll get
worked from behind so hard, you’ll be looking
for a pint glass to plug the hole. Paedophile.
Pisces
Last week was a
shit week and it’s
going to get worse.
Unfortunately
you did not die
of nappy rash as
stated. However all the skin has peeled off your
genitals, leaving open sores. Every time you
take a slash the burn is worse than putting your
knob in the George Foreman. And trust me
that’s a pretty bad burn. Chunt.
Aquarius
Who the fuck
wrote last week’s
Horoscopes? That
man is messed the
fuck up. I want to
build a time machine
so we can travel back to the Middle Ages.
Then I’m going to commit a crime against the
King and shift the blame. Thus I can see him
get hung, drawn and quartered! Don’t see why
you’re laughing, you’re coming with us.

How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be
one continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

up the word KNOBSPLIT. Some
people think split knobs are a
point of humour. Those people
we call ‘wankers’.

So which London tube station sums to 124?
This week’s texts:
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
124
=
_
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.
Mentalist Maze...
With last week’s mentalist maze being
of epic proportions, I expected it to
silent down here. Well nahsomach. A
big hand to Shotgun who managed
to send in a correct solution- even I
couldn’t solve it during a three hour
Mechanical Behaviour lecture! Can I
haz another? Yes, yes you can.
