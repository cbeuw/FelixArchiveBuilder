Imperial receives funding cut
Imperial College will jointly head up
a national research centre for UK
Transport. Alongside the University of
Leeds and University College London,
the UK Transport Research Centre
(UKTR) will utilise the College’s Cen-
tre of Transport Studies; a section of
the Department of Civil and Environ-
mental Engineering.
The £7.75 million research project
was unveiled as Lord Andrew Adonis,
Minister of State for Transport, visited
Imperial for a seminar on biofuel tech-
nology by Imperial’s Energy Futures
Lab and Porter Institute.
“We are committed to delivering a
first class sustainable transport system
in this country – but to do this we need
a first class evidence base. The research
coming out of this Centre will be in-
strumental in ensuring Britain is at the
forefront of new sustainable transport
developments,” he stated.
Director of the CTS, Professor John
Polak stressed the importance of na-
tionwide collaboration to push forward
the UK’s transport systems.
“The UKTRC will formalise the al-
ready strong relationship we have with
our colleagues at Leeds and UCL, and
more widely throughout the trans-
port research community. It will also
provide new funds, an administrative
infrastructure, and an academic fo-
cal point for transport research in this
country. Imperial is set to benefit by
being at the very hub of all this activ-
ity,” he said.
It is not just the three aforemen-
tioned university research centres that
are involved, however. One of the first
projects to get underway involves Im-
perial’s CTS team working with the
London School of Economics. They
are to start studying projected conse-
quences for London’s major transport
projects, including the 2017 Essex to
Maidenhead Crossrail plans.
The UKTR will be funded by a com-
bination of the Department for Trans-
port,theEconomicandSocialResearch
Council (ESRC) and the Scottish Gov-
ernment. What this means for Imperial
is that new employment opportunities
are soon to arrive specialising transport
studies. The creation of a new admin-
istrative workforce is to be installed, as
well academic positions PhD and post
doctorate to be available.
Sir Roy Anderson, Rector at Impe-
rial, was naturally keen to have Impe-
rial contributing to national research
on such a large scale.
“It was a pleasure to welcome Lord
Adonis to Imperial for a visit which
underlines the importance of science
and technology in research intensive
universities to maintaining the UK’s
competitive edge.”

Imperial College is facing substantial
cuts this year after losing out in the
allocation of £1.6bn of state research
funding in favour of lower ranking uni-
versities. It is one of many members of
the Russell Group of leading universi-
ties to be allocated below-inflation in-
creases in the coming year’s grant for
research and teaching.
The financial allocations reflect in
part the results of the 2008 Research
Assessment Exercise (RAE), which
measured the quality of academic re-
search at all universities. These quality
profiles were used by the Higher Edu-
cation Funding Council for England
(HEFCE) to allocate its £8bn budget
for 2009-10. Although the budget has
gone up by 4% since last year Impe-
rial will not be seeing the benefits of
this increase as more money has been
redirected to former polytechnics and
smaller universities that have shown
strong performance in research fields.
A winner in this grant redistribu-
tion is Wolverhampton University,
where research funding will rise from
£138,000 a year to £2.4m. Among its
world-leading research identified by
the RAE were linguistics and library
management.
Imperial has not been the worst af-
fected by the cuts as the proportion of
research funding protected for science
stands at just under £1bn. Neverthe-
less it will still be hard hit, as poten-
tially losing out on £15m of funding
may have knock on effects on current
research being carried out and may
translate into job cuts in certain de-
partments. Imperial’s Rector Sir Roy
Anderson said: “At a time when the
UK is looking to its science, technol-
ogy and medicine powerhouses for
ideas and innovations to help lead the
economic recovery, it can’t have been
intended that we could be reducing the
share of research funds to institutions
which have demonstrated sustained
excellence across successive research
assessments.”
“It is surprising that Imperial College
London, ranked top of all UK institu-
tions for its proportion of research,
judged world-leading or international-
ly excellent, should suffer a real decline
in its allocation of research funding.”
Critics have warned that this year’s
arrangement will spread cash too thin-
ly and starve the best universities of re-
sources needed to remain internation-
ally competitive and attract pioneers in
their field. The think tank Policy Ex-
change has criticised how funds have
been allocated calling it a “squeamish-
ness about supporting an academic
elite.” Further criticism has been voiced
as in addition to the significant fund-
ing increases, a further £400m will be
spent on former polytechnics to help
recruit and retain students from dis-
advantaged backgrounds. This is de-
spite a report last month, which said
the number of deprived teenagers go-
ing to university has hardly increased
between 2001 and 2007 despite £400m
already having been spent. The cash
for such a scheme has been allocated at
a time when the country’s best univer-
sities are contending with financial set-
backs to their research departments.
Conservative Shadow Secretary
David Willetts attacked the govern-
ment’s funding strategy saying, “The
cut in funding for some of our lead-
ing institutions is a mess of ministers’
own making…it is a great pity that our
world-class institutions like Imperial
and the LSE have lost out, especially
when we need them so badly at tough
times like this.”
The disagreement over slashing of
government funding for elite institu-
tions and its redistribution to the less
highly regarded former polytechnics
underlines the ‘class war’ between uni-
versities. Supporters say the academic
caliber of former polytechnics has long
been underrated and reform of an elit-
ist system is long overdue. The effect,
if any, of spreading funding to more
universities, rather than backing the
best institutions will no doubt become
quickly apparent.
Bloody violence at student
favourite House of Coffees
Popular Imperial College student
haunt, House of Coffees (also known
as Caffe Forum), on Gloucester Road
was the scene of a bloody altercation
on Tuesday night which resulted in
the arrests of two men and left another
man requiring medical attention for a
head injury.
At approximately 6:20pm, an argu-
ment erupted in the street between
two men, thought to be of Eastern Eu-
ropean descent, and a Lebanese man
who was with a Pakistani friend.
The argument moved indoors when
the Lebanese man was followed into
the coffee house and challenged by one
of the Eastern European men.
The exchange became more and
more heated, with spitting and swear-
ing, despite the efforts of staff to calm
the situation. The Eastern European
men continued acting aggressively and
the Asian men both picked up chairs in
a bid to defend themselves, according
to witnesses.
The severity of the fracas escalated
violently when the Lebanese man hit
one of the Europeans over the head
with a chair. One young customer on
the periphery of the incident suffered
a minor injury to her head when the
raised chair smashed into an over-
hanging chandelier causing shards of
glass to rain down.
Despite a prolonged period immo-
bile on the floor and a very bloody
wound to his forehead, the injured
man refused to wait for the ambulance
to arrive.
Both European men soon left the
café only to be caught by the emer-
gency services less than 30 minutes
later. One of the pair was arrested in
the street, whilst the injured man was
stopped near Tesco before being taken
to hospital.
Meanwhile, both Asian men re-
mained at the scene. Shortly after the
police arrived the Lebanese man re-
sponsible for causing the injury was
arrested on grounds of assault. Police
cordoned off the coffee house before
taking statements from witnesses.
The cause of the quarrel was unclear,
although it’s thought that the two Eu-
ropean men were both drunk, walk-
ing along Gloucester Road when they
encountered the Asian men outside of
the café, before following them inside.
House of Coffees is a favourite lo-
cal café amongst Imperial College
students, renowned for its student-
friendly prices and late opening times.
The fight flared up, out of the blue and
came as a shock to everyone in the
café, especially having happened so
early during the evening.
Currently it’s unknown whether ei-
ther of the men arrested have been
charged, or how serious the Eastern
European man’s head injury turned out
to be. For the owners of House of Cof-
fee, however, hopefully this was a freak
occurrence and it’s business as usual
from now on.

Wolverhampton Shadow Secretary David Willetts has called the cut “a mess”
Rector seeks to increase
home student’s fees
Kirsty Patterson
& Kadhim Shubber
In a Question and Answer Session with
Imperial’s Rector Sir Roy Anderson,
staff were told to expect to see an in-
crease in tuition fees to double or even
triple the current rate. In answer to a
question from the floor the Rector de-
scribed future tuition fees as being in
the region of £6,000-£9,000 with Uni-
versities taking advantage of the true
market, charging different amounts for
different courses. He said home and
EU students were a financial burden
on universities, pointing out that “we
lose money on these [home and EU
students] and the comparison between
the overseas fee and the home fee is far
too wide”. Overseas students currently
pay £15,500 whilst home students pay
£3,225.
TheRectordefendedtheincreasesay-
ing that they would have to be accom-
panied by an increase in the number
of scholarships given to “students who
come from less wealthy backgrounds”.
He said that Imperial would have to
“find ways of supporting” less well-off
students by generating a “significant
body of fellowships and scholarships”
like American universities.
The Rector had previously told felix
that he expected Tuition Fees to rise
but did not want to see them in excess
of £10,000. Today’s announcement
remains in line with these figues but
could see them at the top end of the
£10,000 mark.
A University College Union (UCU)
poll in 2008 showed that 55% of Brit-
ish adults wanted a university system
that was completely free but the Rec-
tor’s comments come at a time of fi-
nancial uncertainty for Imperial as it
has just lost out on £15m of state re-
search funding as reported on the op-
posite page.
Imperial’s previous Rector, who
was one of the biggest advocates of
£15,000 tuition fees at their concep-
tion, backed down on the issue in 2006
telling students attending a Question
and Answer Session in the Union Din-
ing Hall in Beit Quad that he would
not want to see tuition fees in excess
of £5,000.
The Question and Answer session
with Sir Roy took place in the Great
Hall with overflow space in the Pip-
pard Lecture Theatre. The event
was streamed live online by College
Comunications with a Podcast avail-
able sometime tomorrow morning.
