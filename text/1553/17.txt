in the States, Devious Maids, a new
Lifetime drama/comedy, that serves
as a spin-off of ABC’s hit show Des-
perate Housewives has struck gold
for the creator, Marc Cherry.
In keeping with the Marc Cherry
tradition of opening an episode, the
pilot starts with a death. Not a sui-
cide this time like Mary Alice Young,
but a murder of a maid, Flora (Paula
Garces), who was working for Adri-
an (Tom Irwin, effectively creepy
and slimey) and Evelyn Powell (the
excellent, irreplaceable Rebecca
Wisocky who acts as comedy gold in
every episode she’s in).
Her friends Carmen (Roselyn
Sanchez), Rosie (Dania Ramirez),
Zoila (Judy Reyes) and Valentina
(Edy Ganem) are devastated but
hardly surprised, given what Flora
was really up to.
But life goes on. Carmen, working
for the famous Latin recording art-
ist Alejandro Rubio (Matt Cedeno),
dreams of one day becoming a pop
sensation herself. Although working
under Odessa (Melinda Page Hamil-
ton), a mean Russian who rules over
household with an iron fist is no easy
task.
Rosie is under tremendous pres-
sure working in the household of
Peri Westmore (Mariana Klaveno),
a self-absorbed actress and her has-
been soap opera actor Spence (Grant
Show) who she has an inappropriate
crush on.
Zoila also has her plates full, deal-
ing with her hilariously ditzy boss
Genevieve (Susan Lucciww). Fur-
ther adding to her list of things to
worry about is her daughter Valen-
tina’scrushonGenevieve’sson,Remi
(Drew Van Acker).
The arrival of Marisol (Ana Ortiz),
a new maid at Michael (Brett Cul-
len) and Taylor Stappord’s (Brianna
Brown) house, and her link to Flora’s
murder is the season’s long-running
mystery. Why is Marisol asking
questions about her? Who killed
Flora? What exactly was Flora doing
that put her in so much danger?
Behind the expensive doors of the
Beverley Hills mansions that are
quite simply out of this world, these
Latina maids work tirelessly, picking
up on all the gossip and dirty laun-
dry of their rich and famous bosses.
Looking at the world through their
eyes, from the view of “the help” is
certainly an interesting concept, but
one that is perhaps not utilised fully,
as there are so many plotlines to jug-
gle at once.
When it deviates away from the
main murder mystery, the other sub-
plots have a varying degree of suc-
cess, mostly relying on the talents
of its many stars to pull it off (all five
Latina actresses are spot-on), and
they usually do, no matter how stale
some of the weekly scenarios turn
out to be.
The big mystery of whodunnit is
yet to be solved, but given the way
everything is building up, it promises
to deliver a season finale of shocking
reveals. So stay tuned.
Four successful professional career
women, all of them in complicated
personal crises of their own - that is
how you describe Mistresses, the US
remake of the hit UK show.
Savi (Alyssa Milano) is a lawyer,
Karen (Yunjin Kim) is a psychiatrist,
April (Rochelle Aytes) is a furniture
store owner, and Joss (Jes Macallan)
is a real-estate agent.
Savi and her hunky Australian
chef husband Harry (Brett Tucker)
are struggling to conceive and she
cheats on him with Dominic (Jason
George), a colleague of hers.
Karenhadanaffairwithaterminally
ill patient before prescribing him
enough medication to kill himself.
Now his son is distraught and seeks
her help, not knowing the shady
history between the two.
April’s husband passed away a
couple of years ago and is struggling
to be a single mother; also not
helping is her belief that her husband
may still be alive.
Joss is the most liberated one
of them all, decides to strike up a
lesbian relationship, something
which she’s never done before, with
a client’s girlfriend, even though her
attractive foreign boss with an accent
starts pursuing her.
How these women have time for
relaxing coffee meetings and fancy
lunches is anyone’s guess, given the
magnitude of the problems going on
in their lives, but the soapy, dramatic
twists are deliciously absurd at times,
but that is kind of the appeal of the
show. The characters have a knack
for not taking anything too seriously
it seems, and as an easy-going drama
this sometimes works as a plus.
Everyone makes bad life choices,
and these women are experts
when it comes to creating conflict
and getting stuck in impossible
situations. Which is great news for
the audience, who only have to sit
back and watch.
