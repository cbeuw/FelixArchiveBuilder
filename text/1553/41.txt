It’s the time of the year again.
After a very beautiful summer,
it’s time to get ready to face the
cold, harsh winter and get ready
for a new academic year. Winter is
coming, and so are we in helping
you make the best out of the new
academic year, technically of course.
Yong Wen Chua reveals a bunch of tech secrets for yʼall!
Back to School, Technically
Productivity
Software
If you are looking to buy yourself
a copy of Microsoft Oﬃce, head
to Software4Students (www.
software4students.co.uk) and grab
yourself a copy of “Microsoft Oﬃce
365 University” for a mere £54. (For
those who do not know, this entitles
you to a four year subscription for
Microsoft Oﬃce. The new Microsoft
Oﬃce is now subscription based. The
non-subscription based “Microsoft
Oﬃce Home & Student 2013” is a
whopping £95!) The website also sells
other useful software at a discounted
price. If you are looking for a free
alternative, look no further than
LibreOﬃce and Mozilla Thunderbird
for all your needs. Another interesting
option would be open oﬃce, a
like for like program of the oﬃcial
oﬃce which includes a spreadsheet,
word and powerpoint component.

However if you do use this
open source project, make sure
that you save in the right format!
In addition, why not check out
something new? How about learning
LaTeX? LaTeX is a typesetting
language that allows you to produce
very good looking documents.
LaTeX is not the easiest to learn,
and if you are just starting out,
try LyX. We will cover LaTeX in
a future issue, so keep a lookout!
Also if you are in any of the
engineering , maths, phisics related
courses I would have a look at
matlab and maple. The prior can be
acquired through the university ICT
service, and the latter is free through
Cloud Services
Gadgets
If you do not own a laptop or do not
fancy bringing your 10 pound desktop
replacement around, a tablet might be
for you. You can use a tablet to take
notes during lectures, browse the
web when you are bored (also during
lectures), and even play some candy
crush if that’s your kind of thing.
For a tight budget, look no further
than the new Nexus 7 running on
Android 4.3, which is yet another
version of Jelly Bean. Prices start from
£199. It is an awesome device with a
beautifulscreen.Felixwillbereviewing
the tablet in a future issue. If Android
is not your thing, try the iPad mini,
from £269. For a simple e-book reader,
try out the new Kindle Paperwhite for
just £109. We’ve heard that it’s really
good although we don’t own one.
Oh, if you want to save some
money on your monthly mobile
phone bill, you might want to check
out Giﬀgaﬀ. For a mere £10 a month,
you get 250 minutes of talktime,
unlimited text and 1 GB of internet.
Add £2 for unlimited internet! If you
recommend someone to Giﬀgaﬀ, both
of you will get £5 free credit each!
Entertainment
(Skiving)
All work and no play makes
Jack a dull boy, and we certainly
don’t want YOU, our dear reader
to be dull. Here are some tips for
you to keep yourself entertained.
Music
Film and TV
You can watch your heart’s content
worth of TV and ﬁlms using online
services such as Netﬂix and Loveﬁlm
imperial software shop (unless you
are medicine student, then its £25)
Getting music legally is now so
much easier than before. Spotify oﬀers
a music streaming service that allows
you to stream everything in their large
library for free during the ﬁrst six
months, after which some limitation
applies. If you pay up £10 a month, you
get unlimited plays and you can even
use it on your phone. Google Music,
on the other hand, oﬀers a free cloud
storage service for your music that
allows you to store up to 20000 songs
on their servers to stream everywhere
from your phone to your PC. If you
pay up £10 a month, you get the ability
to stream any song from their massive
library, similar to Spotify. Both
services oﬀer some sort of “radio”
service that plays songs based on
your listening habits. In this editor’s
opinion, Google’s algorithms seem
to oﬀer up better recommendations.
If streaming isn’t your kind of thing
and you prefer to “own” the music you
buy, Amazon and the iTunes store
allow you to buy digital music from
their stores. Amazon MP3 even has a
“cloudplayer”thatallowsaccesstoyour
songs from anywhere. You might also
want to know that Amazon now oﬀers
a free MP3 version of the CDs you buy
from them through the new “Autorip”
service. This oﬀer even extends to CDs
you bought from them in the past.
There are several services out
there that will greatly simplify your
life at Imperial, especially when you
need to work with others. Google
Drive is a very good tool to allow
collaborative editing of documents,
spreadsheets, and even presentations.
If you are looking to “wow” people
with your presentation, try out “Prezi”.
Fancy not chugging around a
portable hard disk with all your ﬁles?
If so, you really need to try out the
various cloud storage services. Google
Drive, Dropbox, iCloud and Skydrive
are just some of the most popular ones
on the internet right now. Use them --
you won’t have to panic if you forgot
to bring your USB drive to college.
Apps
Apps are the heart of every
smartphone and, and a good set will
make your life much easier. Some
usability and productivity apps I use
on a regular basis are the Barclays
mobile banking account (which has
equivalents for the other banks, is
very useful in checking my balance
and doubles as a PINsentry),
Buschecker (or any other highly rated
bus time app, which is very useful
for getting around after a night out)
and iFormulas (iOS) (which helps me
remember those pesky formulas that
haven’t been ingrained in my head).
Lastly, while not intrinsically useful,
the imperial mobile app should be
on every imperial students phone,
which have reasonable prices for their
subscription. You could also subscribe
to various cable services such as
Sky TV and Virgin Media some of
which oﬀer student rates. (You would
also have to pay for a TV License,
which oﬀers a student discount.)
Otherwise, you could always
stream TV shows for free from BBC
iPlayer, iTV Player, or Channel 4 on
Demand so long as they are not “live”.
If you are luck enough to have
parents who suscribe to sky make
sure that you install sky go on your
devices, use it on your PC. As long as
you haven’t reached your device limit
, you should be able to get free sports!
Apps
Apps can be very useful in terms
of productivity, however they can
also add that extra element of
entertainment that your gadget may
be lacking. The FML app, is a good
port of call for a quick laugh, and cut
the rope is a very good game to have
even if it is not free. Furthermore have
a look at Plants vs. Zombies 2 which
