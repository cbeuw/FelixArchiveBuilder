Robert Wright reports back from their latest contstruction project
T
his summer, the annual
El Salvador Project saw
a team of 10 Imperial
College students once again
embark on a journey to
Central America. heir mission this
time was to upgrade a set of houses
constructed in 2008 that, following a
structural analysis by the engineering
consultancy ARUP, were deemed to
be dangerously unstable under certain
seismic conditions. El Salvador being
a seismically active part of the world
meant that a retroﬁt was in order.
he retroﬁt was initially trialled in
2011 in a small village in El Salvador
known as Costa Rica (confusing, we
know). Here, a total of 28 of these
houses were retroﬁtted. As part of this
year’s project, the team visited Costa
Rica in order to check whether there
had been any earthquakes and more
importantly the condition of the retro-
ﬁtted houses. hankfully all 28 houses
were standing despite some reported
seismic activity, which, together with
some minor modiﬁcations, gave us the
green light to continue with this year’s
retroﬁtting project in the much larger
town of San Jose Villanueva.
San Jose Villanueva is home to ap-
proximately 20,000 people so it natu-
rally takes on a diﬀerent feel to the
previous village, which was mainly
jungle terrain with a very large lake.
he team stayed in the centre of town
in a rented house that was equipped
with two rooms (an open plan kitch-
en and bedroom for ten), an outside
ﬂushing toilet (the team were thrilled
after a week of the latrine in Costa
Rica), plumbing that only worked in-
termittently due to water shortages,
and ﬁnally a local shop worker Jordie
(the other tenant and man-with-the-
plan should anything in the house
break). And oh did it break. Blocked
toilets, burst pipes, leaking roofs, this
was deﬁnitely not living the life of Ri-
ley.
When we weren’t battling it out with
the day to day diﬃculties of living in a
third world country, we were of course
retroﬁtting houses. When we ﬁrst ar-
rived in town we had a meeting with
the community in order to ﬁnd out
who wanted the work done and when
would be a convenient time for us
to visit their home and carry out the
work.
he actual retroﬁt involved brac-
ing the existing structure with timber
beams as shown in the picture. his
is done by bolting the internal beams
through the wall to external steel
plates positioned at each column.
In addition, existing wall cracks are
ﬁlled with a local substance known as
‘Cemento Plastico’ , and the house is
painted with waterproof paint to help
protect against the monsoon season.
he project is hands on, with the en-
tire team practising their DIY skills
through the use of power tools and a
good old fashioned hammer. We try
to get the locals involved in the work
too if they are willing, and this helps
to promote information exchange and
skills development. he oﬃcial lan-
guage in El Salvador is Spanish and
naturally we had translators with us to
help do all this.
Whilst the weekdays were devoted
to work, at weekends we went into
tourist mode. he paciﬁc side of El
Salvador is a famous surf spot and
the team spent some time here ‘surf-
ing’ and chilling on the beach. Other
weekend ventures included clubbing
in the capital city San Salvador, tomb-
stoning oﬀ 10m tall waterfalls (there
are taller ones though if you dare), and
a trip to ancient sites containing Ma-
yan ruins.
his year’s project has been a great
experience and we hope the work has
been beneﬁcial. he project this year
has undergone a slight transformation
what with a committee now in place to
oversee the running of the project and
new long term objectives that focus
on engineering, evaluation and educa-
tion. As in previous years, we continue
to work with the UK registered charity
Engage for Development (founded by
Imperial College alumni) and the lo-
cal NGO in El Salvador, REDES, who
advise and help out.
Recruitment for summer 2014 will
soon be underway. Students in the
Department of Civil and Environmen-
tal Engineering (where the project
is based) will automatically receive a
recruitment email, but applications
from students in other departments
are also welcomed. If you’d like to
join us, just follow us on Facebook
(facebook.com/ElSalvadorProject) or
Twitter (@IC_ESP) and look out for
the recruitment email. We’re particu-
larly interested in hearing from Span-
ish speakers. For information and
enquiries, email us on elsalvad@impe-
rial.ac.uk or check out our website at

My Speech, My Little story
Yi Liu reminisces about his first Toastmasters speech
L
adies and Gentlemen,
Imagine yourself standing
on the stage with a thousand
pairs of eyes staring blankly at
you, anticipating the glorious
moment when your mouth opens
to push out the words that you have
prepared for so long. Somewhere in
your heart, you reassure yourself again
and again that it is all going to be okay,
but then what comes out is nothing
more than a struggling, noiseless
‘pop’. Does this sound familiar?
Public speaking is a little misleading
devil that haunts us in our daily lives.
When we look our student presiden-
tial candidates running from lecture
theater to lecture theater to speak in
front of us before the lecture starts,
it seems to be an easy, smooth, per-
haps even enjoyable experience to
them. However, when these inevita-
ble moments eventually come to you,
it seems that even two to three audi-
ence members are enough to form a
formidable wall in your heart. his is
the moment that you start to wonder,
“What’s wrong with me?”
Let me share a little story. As a ﬁrst
year Imperial undergraduate, I had
the fortune of discovering a young
club hidden in the Mechanical Engi-
neering department called Imperial
College Speakers. Amazingly, it is part
of a global organization that dedicates
itself to nurturing great speakers and
leaders, Toastmasters International
(a tip for the job-seeking students:
HR departments know this organiza-
tion well). I remember the ﬁrst meet-
ing quite vividly: the joyous, relaxed
atmosphere that illuminated the air,
sandwiched with the slight nervous-
ness from each member as they stood
up on the stage and started speaking.
Yes, this is a club that asks you to make
a speech.
I had my share of embarrassment.
I stood in front of 20 people, legs
slightly trembling and deﬁnitely feel-
ing very anxious about my speech. So
as I tried to make a desperate attempt
to calm myself down, I began to shout
in fragments: “GO-OD EV-E-NING
LA-DI-ES...”. I sounded like a spoilt
microphone that only makes a sound
when you bang it on its corners. How-
ever, the amazing thing about Toast-
master is that immediately after the
speech, the audience gave me an ap-
proving glance that even I found it to
be unbelievable. Hey, all the members
are just here to learn, so this is a chal-
lenge with no failure, it is just another
experience.
As I went down the journey towards
being a speaker, I learn a few lessons
and cleared a few misconceptions.
First of all, speaking can be improved
by experience. If you ever have the
chance of audience a speech by Ex-
president Michelle, you will ﬁnd her
to be the most graceful lady on stage
(oﬀ-Stage too). You can’t really believe
(I still can’t) that a human can be so
composed on stage, even though the
evidence is blatantly just in front of
you. However, behind this grace, be-
hind the composure, behind all this
unbelievable conﬁdence, is nothing
more than two years of public speak-
ing experience. Trust me, if you are
willing to go that extra mile, eventu-
ally you will be a better speaker than
you ever dreamed yourself to
be.
It is through making one
speech after another that
I learnt a lot about how to
inspire people, how to be
humourous and how to
carry on a conversation.
But it is not
only about
the skills that
I acquired, it is
the feeling of accomplishment, the
satisfaction that was imprinted on
my heart when people just cheered
me on after a successful speech. It is
cliché but the truth is that every time
members come to me and thank me
for inspiring them, I am proud of my
speech because it is changing people’s
life one at a time.
Now, it is time for me to end oﬀ with
a little scenario for you to consider.
When we look at the professional
speakers standing in the limelight with
people cheering so loudly, there is
idea that crosses our mind “wouldn’t
it be great if one day I can speak like
him?”(Admit it!) Well, maybe
it is time for you to give this
thought a little nudge.
Who knows, maybe
twenty years down the
road, you will be thank-
ful that little decision
you make here.
