LOCAL TRAVEL
W
alking around
is a great way
to get to know
the local area
as well as
nearby parts of London. You often
ﬁnd the best places to go while
wondering around or walking to
another engagement. Great places
to walk to near South Kensington
include Hyde Park (obviously),
Fulham Road & Kings Road,
Knightsbridge (and Harrods),
Bayswater and Osford Street. If
you do wander down to Kings
Road you’ll ﬁnd youself minutes
away from the hames and aross
the river from Battersea and the
beautiful Battersea Park.
On the other hand walking is
much slower than taking other
methods of transport (unless you’re
on a bus during rush hour hut it’s
healthy and refreshing!
B
uses! Hmm, a tricky
one! Buses can be
great to get around in,
providing the speed of
a motor vehicle while
still giving you a chance to absorb
your surroundings. Even if you’re a
native Londoner, you’ll still have a
lot of new things to discover, after
all it’s a big city! Buses do however
have downsides, they can be caught
in heavy traﬃc during peak periods
and the seats can be hellish to sit in
if you’re above average height. Let’s
not get onto the subject of how
cavalier some bus drivers are when
navigating the roads.
he South Kensington campus
has fantastic links to the rest of
London via buses, you can even get
to Heathrow on a night bus! Buses
9 and 10 go west to Hammersmith
and east to Trafalgar Square and
Oxford street while other buses can
take you to places far and wide.
T
he Tube is London’s
underground transport
service, a bit like having
trains underground that
come every 2-4 minutes
(amazing I know!), can often be
packed full of people during peak
times (I hope you don’t mind
standing in awkward positions)
and have a fewer number of chairs
(bummer). However the Tube is an
awesome way to get to places in a
short amount of time; travelling
from South Kensington you can get
to Charing Cross (Embankment)
within 15 minutes, Hammersmith
in 10 minutes, Heathrow in
30ish minutes and Kings Cross
Station similarly in 30 minutes.
he Tube does stop running soon
after midnight (or 1 AM on some
nights) so it’s not as helpful to get
back from a night out, so if you’re
planning a late night excursion
you’ll probably want to check how
to get back by bus.
L
ondon is very well serviced
by trains. As well as
getting trains to other
parts of London there are
also several stations that
host trains travelling across the
country, such as London Euston,
London Charing Cross, London
Marylebone and London Liverpool
Street. You can even get a train to
Scotland if you’re willing to spend 5
hours on a train. here’s not much
more to say about train travel, we’ve
all been on trains and know how to
use them so here’s a picture of a cat.
C
ycling in London can
be a fun or dangerous
and deadly. Many
people cycle to college
from where they live
and make the journey in one piece.
However if you’re not used to big
city traﬃc maybe take it easy at ﬁrst,
motorists can be rude, ignorant
and just plain stupid at times. If a
taxi doens’t want to stop to let you
cross Prince Consort Road to get
to the Union, do you really think
they’ll be any better when you’re on
a bicycle?
On the positive side, cycling at
night is really cool, the roads are
mostly empty and you can cycle in
fanatstic locations. Hyde Park is an
amazing place to cycle when it’s not
during rush hour if you’re planning
a leisure trip but you can also cycle
across it to make quick trips to
Paddington or Oxford Street. And
there’s always “Boris Bikes”.
Travel Savings
#1 Oyster Card
his is a key item, buy one as soon
as you can! It’s not really a saving
becuase it’s the default travel tool
for the majority of Londoners but if
you don’t have an oyster card then
bus and train prices are much more
expensive.
Oyster cards have a pay-as-
you-go feature that allows you
to buy travel credit as well as
longer duration travel passes (or
“travelcards”) which are valid for
a week, a month or longer. If you
plan to buy week or month long
travelcards, applying for a £10
18+ Oyster card will allow you to
get savings of 30% on your week’s
travel. Oyster cards are valid on
buses, trains, tubes, the DLR and
even the River service, but can only
be used in London.
#2 16-25 Railcard
You should already read about
this in the Business section, if you
haven’t then tut, tut! he 16-25
railcard is the ultimate in discount
rail travel, saving you 1/3 from any
train fare as long as you travel after
10:30 (you might want to check
that). For £30 a year you can take
advantage of these reduced fares
by travelling around England
and visiting new places. he card
also works in London so if you’re
staying with your parents make
sure you pick one up sharpish!
Another awesome feature you
might want to know about, you can
link your railcard to the oyster card
we mentioned earlier in order to
have one card to save them all! his
applies the saving to all Tube and
train journeys across London.
Barclays Bikes
You can buy a key or hire a bike with you r credit/debit card from the stand.
I
f you want to cycle as commuter
to College or plan to cycle on the
roads, it’s probably best to get a
“real” bicycle, and don’t worry Felix
will let you know when this term’s
campus bicycle auction takes place
(oh, and if you ever abandon your
bike around College, you might
ﬁnd it here a few months later).
However if you’re more of a
casual cyclist then maybe give
the Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme a
go. Aﬀectionally known as “Boris
Bikes” in tribute to the Mayor of
London the cycle hire scheme let’s
you hire a bike for a short period
of time. here are lots of docks
in Central London and the local
area and if you didn’t already
know they’re represented by
the red circles on our map! he
scheme seems daunting but it can
be really fun. My best experience of
the scheme has been cycling past
Buckingham Palace at 1AM!
