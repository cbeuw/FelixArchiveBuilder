Been out last night and not exactly feeling the best for your Maths
test this morning? Fear not! Felix Food is here to help you feel better!
Emergency hangover cures
he classic beans on toast is an awesome hangover cure. Not only
do the beans contain high protein, it also releases energy slowly, so
you feel better for the day! If you want to increase your appetite at
the same time, why not add a can of tinned tomatoes? Tomatoes
are high in Vitamin C so you have a higher chance of avoiding the
good old Freshers’ Flu, while making the whole thing taste better.
Recipe: (if it is not obvious enough)
• 1 can of Baked Beans
• 1 can of chopped tomatoes
• Bread
• Toast the bread
• Heat up the tin of beans and mix in the tomatoes
• Serve when hot!
Got a bit of bacon in the fridge but nothing else for your full fry
up? Why not start your morning with a bit of Asian ﬂavour? Noo-
dles are one of the most popular foods in the world and it is so easy
to cook, even if it is not the ones in the plastic pot. You can use
fresh or dried noodles for this, both are available in both conven-
tional and Chinese supermarkets, although the dried noodles will
be able to sit in your cupboard for longer and possibly cheaper. If
you do go round China Town, I would deﬁnitely recommend you
stock up on some Chinese branded dried noodles – not only is it
quick to make, so is a great alternative to the baked beans on toast,
but also ﬂavouring sachets often comes in the packet, so you even
save on the soup stock!
Recipe
• 1 piece of smoked back bacon, chopped and trimmed
• 2 spring onions, white and green separated and ﬁnely
sliced
• Some frozen peas
• 1/4 teaspoon paprika
• 2 teaspoon cornﬂour
• 200mL vegetable stock/ soup from sachet ﬂavouring
• 150g (or how much you can eat) of noodles
• Splash of Worcestershire sauce
• Boil and drain the noodles if it is dried.
• In a small pan, fry the bacon for a few minutes, add the
white parts of the spring onions, peas and paprika, then cook for
1 minute more. To get a bit of smooth texture, ﬁrst mix the corn-
ﬂour with a little stock to make a paste, then stir this into the pan
with the rest of the stock.
• Add the noodles and a great splash of Worcestershire
sauce to give it more ﬂavour
• Leave it to simmer for a couple of minutes until thick
and saucy, the scatter the green parts of spring onion on top to
give it the looks!
Not feeling good from Freshers’ Flu and you still want to be keen
and attend your 9am lecture? he spices in this omelette will clear
the airways and put you back into active mode! You might not
know that apart from making non-alcoholic beer, ginger is also
a well known nausea remedy that has been used for hundreds of
years – and the protein in the eggs will help you get rid of alcohol
in your bloodstream.
Recipe
• 2 eggs
• Half a red pepper, chopped into small cubes
• A small piece of ginger, peeled and ﬁnely chopped
• Dried chilli, depends on your spice-ability.
• A clove of garlic, peeled and ﬁnely chopped
• Whisk the eggs until smooth
• Pour the remaining ingredients into the egg mixture and
mix well.
• Coat the pan with oil and heat up on the hob. Only when
the oil is very hot, pour in the mixture and swirl it so that the
whole pan is coated.
• Fry the mixture until it becomes a semi-solid omelette.
You should be able to move the pan and the omelette stays one
piece.
• Time to cook the other side. If you are feeling adventur-
ous and awake, ﬂip it on the pan! If not, then the best way to do it
is to place a plate over the pan and turn them both over. hen you
can slide the uncooked side back on the pan.
• Should take about another minute, then time to eat!
