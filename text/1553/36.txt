Official Competition he Double
A comedy in which a man is driven
to insanity as his doppelganger starts
taking over his own life, Simon (Jesse
Eisenberg) always seems to be living
in the shadow of James, his “double”.
Whilst tongue-tied, embarrassed and
awkward around his crush Hannah
(Mia Wasikowska), James successfully
climbs the corporate ladder, which
catches Hannah’s eyes, much to
Simon’s dismay.
It’s quirky, edgy, with a typically
strong performance from Eisenberg
who absolutely excels in the odd but
likable roles.
Under the Skin
Scarlett Johansson is an alien creature
who has been sent to Earth by a large
corporation - her task? To prey on
unsuspecting hitchhikers.
As the huntress she goes on the
prowl, luring these poor souls into the
dark so she can have her wicked ways
with them.
Some have dismissed the ﬁlm calling
it laughably bad, but others have
praised the lead performance as well
as the chilling, creepy atmosphere that
creates a unique surreal feel to the
overall narrative. Quite the audience-
divider, this one.
Parkland
Would you like to see Zac Efron as
your surgeon if you’ve just been shot?
Yeah...me neither...but in Parkland,
President John F. Kennedy’s shocking
assassination leaves the entire
country in turmoil. he hospital staﬀ
(including Efron - the surgeon on-call
it seems, and Marcia Gay Harden as
a nurse), the authorities (led by Billy
Bob hornton) are working as quickly
as they can to track down the shooter/
shooters, and Paul Giamatti plays
Abraham Zapruder, the man who
inadvertently ﬁlmed the assassination.
It no doubt has an incredible
ensemble; further adding to the long
list of names above is Jacki Weaver,
James Badge Dale, Jackie Earle Haley,
Tom Welling, Colin Hanks and Ron
Livingston. However early reception
from the festival circuit has been
mixed - with far too many characters
taking up room, not allowing each
individual “vantage point” to breathe
and have a sustainable plot-line of its
own. So the chances of this winning
anything is miniscule.
Tracks
In 1977, Robyn Davidson travelled
from Alice Springs to the Indian
Ocean, crossing approximately 1,700
miles of Australian deserts - this she
did with her dog and four camels.
Tracks tells this amazing true story
of this one woman’s courage to achieve
the impossible and her never-ending
ambition. Wasikowska gives one of
the strongest performances of her
career, showing both the independent,
spirited energy of the lone traveller,
as well as the often emotionally
vulnerable and fragile nature.
