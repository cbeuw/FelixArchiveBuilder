Philippa Skett gets you ready to face your greatest fear: socialising
A
ccording to your
personal statement, ever
since you can remember
you have always
wanted to study RNA
replication, so we here know you love
a bit of science. Even if you actually
meant it, and we know some of you
probably didn’t, science will no doubt
be at the back of your mind this week.
But so it should be! his week is all
about making friends in halls, drinking
in halls, planning to go to Ministry of
Sound and then giving up after ﬁnding
out the route home takes two buses.
However, if you can’t bear to ask
yet another person what A-Levels
they did, or what halls they are in, you
can always deploy some of these facts
whilst waiting for a pint in FiveSix-
Eight. Even if you don’t feel like using
science chat up lines (that helicase one
is a winner, by the way) you may still
learn some hints and tips to get you
through this undoubtedly messy week.
Alcohol – possibly the
only friend you may make
this week
Ethanol, that cheeky little two car-
bon compound, is what gives pints a
punch- after being absorbed into the
bloodstream it is transported to the
liver, and then broken down by two
sets of enzymes. It is ﬁrst converted
into acetaldehyde by one enzyme, al-
cohol dehydrogenase, and then into
acetate by another, aldehyde dehydro-
genase. When these are imbalanced,
and aldehyde dehydrogenase is less
eﬃcient, acetaldehyde builds up and
delivers the Asian Flush some of you
might experience this week.
Ethanol is metabolised at a rate of
around one regular drink every nine-
ty minutes, so if you succumb to the
usual calls of “Down it Fresher!” too
regularly, your blood alcohol level will
rise, and it will eventually eﬀect your
brain. With ethanol being a depres-
sant, meaning it enhances the eﬀects
of the inhibitory neurons whilst weak-
ening the excitatory neurons in your
brain, it will at ﬁrst make you relaxed,
then tired, then eventually will make
you pass out.
Please refrain from writing on your
friend’s face if this happens, or at
least do it once you have put them to
bed. No doubt one day (possibly even
Wednesday this week) it will be you in
the same position!
Hangovers – no pain, no
gain, right?
Science is still uncertain about what
a hangover actually is- the best guess
is that it is a collection of symptoms
which manifest due to the multiple
physiological eﬀects from drinking al-
cohol.
With alcohol being a diuretic it natu-
rally increases urinary output leading
to dehydration, causing thirst and diz-
ziness in the morning. It is an irritant
and can also stimulate a higher rate of
production of gastric secretions, with
both resulting in nausea and the pos-
sibility of vomiting. Finally it can cause
vasodilatation of blood vessels in the
brain, making the brain press against
the skull and delivering that character-
istic hangover headache.
If you are smart enough to take pain-
killers before the onset of the hango-
ver, only take aspirin as paracetamol is
metabolised by the liver too, which is
under enough strain as it is.
Fresherʼs Flu – when the
cough syrup replaces the
Jägerbombs
his blanket term is generally used
to cover the run-down feeling that
comes from not sleeping enough, not
eating properly or drinking more than
you probably can handle, but can be
caused by infections too.
Usually this “ﬂu” is actually a mani-
festation of the common cold. With
there being 200 diﬀerent types of vi-
ruses that can cause a cold, and fac-
toring in the many diﬀerent nation-
alities you will probably bump into
around campus, it is inevitable you
will encounter a strain you are not al-
ready immune to.
Combined with exhaustion, poor
nutrition and excessive drinking,
your already weakened immune sys-
tem doesn’t stand a chance this week
if that sniﬄing guy in your intro lec-
ture sneezes in your direction. he
beginning of the new academic year
also coincides with the beginning of
ﬂu season too, so even if you manage
to avoid human contact for the whole
week (and I know full well some of
you will) you still may ﬁnd yourself
sneezing by Sunday.
Freaking out about Fresher’s ﬂu?
Arm yourself with hand sanitizer, a
packet of tissues (infused with that
nice Aloe Vera to keep your nose
from going all scaly) and a properly
cooked meal every now and then. If
you still don’t manage to escape it,
you will feel right as rain by Novem-
ber. Promise.
So, with your snakebite in one hand,
your hand sanitiser in another and a
brain full of fun fresher facts, I fail to
see just how you could not have a fun
time this Welcome Week. Relax, so-
cialise, don’t blow your whole student
loan on a food shop in Harrods and
generally enjoy your time as a brand
new student.
Look out for us at Fresher’s fair and
write for Science too- we might just
accidently tell your tutor your per-
sonal statement was all lies otherwise.

See this? This wonʼt be you. See that guy with glasses sitting in the corner texting. Guess where this is going...
