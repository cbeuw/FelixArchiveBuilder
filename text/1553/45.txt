The Hangman reviews the first blog from YOUR dear leader
T
oday,heHangmancritically
evaluates the Sabbatical
Blog written by our
incumbent union president
David ‘Shorts’ Goldsmith.
here’s only one possible thing that
could be worse to read, and since they
don’t do death warrants in this coun-
try anymore, this blog post moves
swiftly to the top of my list.
Your sphincter should already be
twitching by the time you’ve read the
three exclamation points in the title,
but your anus goes from ‘puckered’
to ‘Niagara’ by the time you read the
body of the text.
“You’re soon to be immersed in the
madness of freshers’ week”. David
and I have wildly diﬀerent deﬁni-
tions of the word ‘madness’. For me,
a mad night out is not an awkward
queue for expensive drinks while a
30-something DJ spits out the playlist
he wrote for his niece’s Bar Mitzvah
party.
“Even the shyest students are re-
ceptive to social interaction!”. I don’t
know about you, but I was always
taught to stay very far away from men
who use the word ‘receptive’ when
they’re trying to get you to come to
a night out.
Our glorious and eternal leader
would like to encourage all of the
freshers not to “take it too seriously
at the beginning”, but some of us don’t
do medicine, and actually have to do
work in the ﬁrst few weeks. Some of
us even have tests to take and lectures
to sleep through. But it’s sage advice,
after all, David didn’t get where he is
today by ‘working’.
he third point just abandons any
semblance of style with a three-line
title and no subtitle. he classic joke
is that doctors have bad handwrit-
ing, but will we one day see an article
in the Lancet by David ‘Barbie sold
separately’ Goldsmith that consists
solely of a 4 page Abstract?
When I picture him writing this,
I picture a nightmarish creature
crouching upon an oﬃce chair in the
dead of night, while its hideous, bloat-
ed tongue lolls across the keyboard to
create words that our mere human
bodies are able to pronounce. Per-
haps its this language diﬀerence from

You arrive at university with
a big smile and lots of hope.
Once you get into your new
room while your parents un-
pack your things you decide to
read the newspaper laid care-
fully on your bed. You turn to
Hangman and laugh at the bril-
liantly written horoscopes until
you lose consciousness.
You’re going to have a rela-
tively good week. You’ll only
throw up once, sleep in one
lecture and get a C on your
introductory maths test. Well
done you! As you sit back
and enjoy this week of peace
you realise you can smell
smoke. You wake up to see
your roommate burning your
textbooks with black candles.
This week you looking up and
down your corridor in halls...
So many possible friends,
where to start? You go to
your computer and code an
algorithm that devises the
most efficient route to take.
The results shocks you. DIE
NERD DIE!!!
You hold your breath for a
dare. When you recover from
your lack of oxygen Freshers’
week is over, nobody wants
to be your friend and the rats
in Fisher Hall have eaten the
sandwich your mother left you.
Welcome to Imperial!
You see the Freshers’ arriv-
ing with their “14” hoodies
and bright smiles. This only
serves to remind you how old
you are and how much dignity
and self-esteem you’ve lost
while trying to get your PhD.
You sigh and reach into your
desk drawer where your hand
slides over your Felicies be-
fore firmly gripping your trusty
bottle of vodka.
As you reach college you re-
alise you’ve forgotten your
books, calculator and glasses.
You’ve also forgotten to brush
your teeth and comb your hair
but you assume nobody will
notice. As you enter the lec-
ture theatre and walk towards
the front everybody turns to
look at you and silence falls.
You jump onto the stage, head
to the lectern and begin the
lecture.
WOW WOW WOW WOW! A
real life Bow and Arrow set! You
get to ride through the streets
of London on your trusty steed
“Arriva”, shooting arrows at ap-
ples on people’s heads as you
pass by. Except that this is not
a dream, you are arrested by
the police and removed from
Arriva in shame. Jail, do not
pass GO!
THIS WEEK YOU SHARE YOUR HOROSCOPE. The Hang-
man just doesn’t care enough about his job.
You’ve just arrived at Imperial from an all-girls school and are
amazed at the sheer number of boys there are on campus.
You expect to have a fun Freshers’ week where you plan to
make lots of friends and forge new experiences. Instead you
have a week where boys only mumble in your presence and
can’t look you in the eyes while the other girls have disap-
peared off to the UCL halls to find some people with real
social skills. You resign yourself to four years of misery and
loneliness and quietly plot to take over.
This week you arrive at univer-
sity and finally see your new
room. You see a curious news-
paper resting on your bed as
you walk in to the room. While
you read the paper, your par-
ents pack away your things,
and- oh, wait. Damn, can I start
the question again? What do
you mean the exam’s almost
over? This will affect my future!
This week you decide it would
be funny to tip a bin full of beans
over unsuspecting passers by
through the window in you room.
You pick up the bin, it’s heavier
than expected. You struggle to
carry it over to the window and
with a huge heave chuck the
bin out. But wait, the window re-
stricters! Damn, it’s gonna be a
smelly winter.
This week you decide that you’ll
follow whatever your horo-
scope has planned for you.
Well, it’s a Wednesday evening
and you’re bored. You decide
to head over to the Beit Quad
and visit the Felix Office in the
West Basement with a crate
of beer. You wake up 3 years
chained to an iMac in the office
wearing glasses. Damn it!
Cyclopean to English that makes the
article so terrible, perhaps he rushed
the article as he hurried to don his
human skin before his next meeting
to decide how best to convert human
souls into tuition fees. Who knows?
What I do know is that whatever
dark recess of the world he pulled this
post from, the creatures that dwell
must be the ones responsible for the
most recent blight upon humanity:
YOLO.a
he acronym that came to be syn-
onymous with a devil-may-care atti-
tude held by those that desperately ﬁll
their social media with a thick black
ichor known as swag. All joking aside,
this is just plain embarrassing. he
man has one job this week, and that
is to try to make the Union look good.
It’s a shame you only live once, be-
cause he’s really mucked that up.
WHICH IS THE REAL PERSON?
