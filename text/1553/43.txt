KOP’s visit to Kenya
Kenyan Orphan Project
KOP
his July Imperial College’s branch of
the Kenyan Orphan Project set out for
their annual trip to Kenya to see the
work that their efforts had made pos-
sible. hroughout the year, the group
had been ﬁnding new and novel ways
of raising money for their cause, be it
through nights out, tube collections,
or a Valentine courier service.
It was with high expectations that
the students disembarked at Nairobi
airport in the early morning of July
5th. hey were not disappointed by
any means, and extent to which they
enjoyed the experience can be easily
seen from the following accounts.
he students spent two weeks in
west Kenya in a town called Kisumu.
hey had the chance to spend one
week in Ombeyi feeding centre and
the next week at Oasis of hope sec-
ondary school.
Ombeyi Feeding centre
he Ombeyi feeding centre provides
meals regularly for orphaned or vul-
nerable children. It also provides a
fresh water borehole and a water
management system on the site for
the whole community. his centre
was built by KOP funding and built by
KOP students in 2007. Here the stu-
dents helped with gardening, cook-
ing and serving meals to children and
then later were able to spend time
with them. hey also had the chance
to visit some of the children’s’ family
and houses. his came as a big shock
to many of the students who realised
the harsh realities that many of these
young children face every day.
One of the students from the pro-
gramme tells us about his experi-
ences:
“I was lucky enough to visit Ombeyi
feeding centre in Kenya.
his centre feeds around 80 chil-
dren who are have lost one or two of
their parents or have parents who are
unable to look after them. here are
around 3 cooks who work very hard
so that the children can have two
meals a day regularly.
We got stuck in straight away and
helped with cooking, gardening, and
cleaning and helped with serving food
to the children.
What I enjoyed most was spending
time with the kids and singing and
dancing to the games they showed
us. I also realized how hard everyone
works in the centre to help these chil-
dren and it was truly an inspiration..
he home visits made us realise how
lucky and privileged we are. Seeing
the poverty and diﬃculties the chil-
dren face made me even more deter-
mined to fundraise and stop children
having to face such situations.”
Oasis of Hope school
Oasis of Hope school offers second-
ary education at a low cost to very
bright and motivated children from
the neighbouring slums who would
otherwise not have been able to afford
secondary education. New dormito-
ries were built funded by KOP which
the students from the summer team
painted and decorated. hey took part
in lessons, taught health education
and discussed gender issues with the
children. Many of the KOP students
were very impressed by how intelli-
gent the children were and how keen
they were to learn.
Alex Lai a member from 2013 sum-
mer team had this to say:
“Oasis of Hope is a huge inspiration,
having 200 very talented students, the
majority of whom have had a tough
upbringing. We were immersed into
their daily routine from attending
their lessons to doing scouts as their
extra curricular activity. At the end
of the week we were treated to many
performances from the students, such
as poetry, drama, singing and danc-
ing. hese performances showed how
talented these students are and how
inspirational they could be to other
students around the world.
he trip has had many thoughts and
emotions from excitement and joy
to the realization of the harsh reality
many face here, we only saw a small
part of Kenya, but big changes can be
made to small parts. It is a trip I would
encourage everyone to undertake, as
not only is it highly enjoyable but it
opens your eyes more to the world.”
HOVIC
he students were also lucky to spend
some time in HOVIC. HOpe for Vic-
toria’s Children (HOVIC) is a week-
end feeding programme for over 100
street children. Street children in
Kenya face many hardships from lack
of shelter to physical and sexual abuse.
HOVIC helps these children by not
only providing meals but also helps
with their education development and
medical care. hey try and teach valu-
able vocational training to the chil-
dren which can help them get jobs and
become self suﬃcient so that they don
not have to go back to streets. KOP
also funds a number of street children
through primary education and addi-
tional support for those within HOV-
IC in secondary education.
To ensure the children’s safety KOP
also helped with the purchase of a
property in Kisumu for ‘night shelter’
where up to a 100 children can sleep
at night safely.
A student tells us of his experience
visiting HOVIC:
“he HOVIC centre for street chil-
dren really opened our eyes to a differ-
ent side to the lives of children we had
met so far. he children here had been
through some unimaginably trau-
matic lives and the centre was a way
to allow them to be children again. We
were also lucky enough to be able to
play a game of football against them,
which was actually quite a challenge.”
After coming back from the projects
everyday students were able to wind
down and socialise at the rooftop bar.
hey also had a chance to visit many
cultural locations such as Kit Makai, a
religious place for the locals.
A student from the trip said this
about the social aspect of KOP sum-
mer programme:
“Although in the daytime is ex-
tremely rewarding and enjoyable, the
events in the evenings and weekends
are really fun and great way to get to
know everyone in the group. hese in-
clude karaoke and bar nights and visit-
ing the equator and the Masai market.”
his annual trip opens the eyes of
many of the students to the ugly face
of poverty in developing countries
such as Kenya and how the most vul-
nerable people of society suffer from
it. he money raised is incredibly
valuable. he money raised by the stu-
dents transforms the lives of so many
orphans and gives them a ﬁghting
chance in life and to help them fulﬁl
their dreams.
Background
he Kenyan Orphan Project (KOP)
is a charity and society that supports
vulnerable children and orphans in
Kenya through health, education and
social welfare projects. KOP is sup-
ported by a number of UK universi-
ties including Imperial College (since
2010) who each make a huge and valu-
able difference to the lives of hundreds
of children.
Each summer, a group of Imperial
Students form the summer team who
travel to Kisumu, West Kenya, for two
weeks to directly work on the projects
that we support. You could ﬁnd your-
self teaching children about health-
care, helping to build schools, playing
games with the children or helping
with the feeding programmes created
for street children, whilst also being
able to explore Kenya. We place a big
emphasis on welcoming all members
and holding regular socials.
Whether you’re looking to person-
ally make a difference to the lives of
vulnerable children (whilst also seeing
Kenya’s amazing wildlife, scenery and
culture), an outlet for your creativ-
ity, being involved with KOP’’s wider
activities (such as the Big Chill Mu-
sic Festival) or being part of a grow-
ing society that supports extremely
worthwhile projects, KOP has a place
for everyone.
All members are encouraged to join
in, whether they choose to be a part of
the summer team or not, and we will
help to support all possible fundrais-
ing ideas and challenges!
