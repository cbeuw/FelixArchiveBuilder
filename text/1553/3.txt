James Tsim drives a hard bargain with your moneyz
H
opefully anyone who
is eligible has already
applied for Student
Finance England. SFE
oﬀers student loans and
grants which help cover university
fees and living costs. Imperial
College London also oﬀers bursaries/
scholarships which can be applied for.
Why open a student
account?
With the start of university, the most
important preparation you should be
doing is to ‘Sort out your ﬁnances’.
he ﬁrst step to achieve this is to
open a student account at the right
bank. here are many banks out there,
each and every one of them oﬀering
a variety of diﬀerent services and
freebies. he most important thing
you should be considering is cost-free
borrowing (interest free overdraft).
his is the crucial diﬀerence between
student accounts and standard
accounts. Student accounts also oﬀer
the same functions such as internet/
mobile banking, direct debit facilities,
contactless etc. hese accounts are
designed for people who are attending
higher education, so open your
account now!
Interest Free Overdraft:
his is the most important factor
you should be considering, as you
may be feeling ﬁnancial constraints
later on in the year. he larger the
Interest Free Overdraft the better, as
some banks could charge you more
to increase your borrowing. Many
students also use overdraft to add
funds to an ISA, this is a savings
account with a favourable tax status,
thereby earning you interest on free
borrowed money. Currently the
banks which oﬀer the best interest
free overdrafts with up to £3000
are HSBC and Halifax. Beware that
borrowing past the free overdraft
limit will incur you heavy charges,
along with interest rates of up to 24%
AER.
Branches situated near
campus:
Having a bank branch near campus
is very important for any problems
with your account, or lost cards after
a wild night out. here is a Santander
branch on campus, with Barclays,
RBS, HSBC, Llodys TSB and Natwest
within the South Kensington area.
16 – 25 Student Railcard
his oﬀer entitles you to a student 16-
25 railcard available for up to 4 years,
which oﬀers 1/3 oﬀ rail fares. hese
cards normally cost £30 per year, but
some banks give this for free when you
open a student account. his is useful
for example when taking weekend
trips away to Brighton Pleasure
Beach or when visiting friends in
Manchester (£76.30 without railcard;
£51 with railcard). hese railcards
can also be added to your oyster
cards to give a 34% discount of tube
fares (oﬀ-peak) and 34% oﬀ the daily
cap. his card is an amazing deal and
I would recommend you purchase
one if the bank you choose does not
oﬀer it for free.
Taste Card
No doubt after coming to London
as a student you will be doing a lot
of cooking as a ﬁrst year student.
However for those of you who are
looking to try the various diﬀerent
chain restaurants and cuisines in
London, some banks oﬀer a free taste
card for every year of study when
you set up an account with them.
his card worth £80 is oﬀered by
Natwest and RBS, and oﬀers 50% oﬀ
or 2 for 1 deals at thousands of UK
restaurants (e.g GBK, Pizza Express,
Zizzi Restaurant). I personally have
never had a taste card, but in case you
want to try it out, they are currently
oﬀering a 30 day free trial card.
Headline Interest Rate
his is the highest interest rate
(gross/AER) paid on balances held
in the accounts. Most of the student
accounts oﬀer 0% headline interest,
however some banks do oﬀer it,
such as HSBC (2%), Halifax (0.1%),
Santander (1%) and Bank of Ireland
(0.5%). My recommendation is that
if you do have spare cash in your
account, transfer it to a high interest
savings account.
Other
HSBC has teamed up with Sony
to oﬀer up to 18 music albums to
download for free.
LLodys TSB oﬀers free NUS Card
and £75 oﬀ a holiday booked through
STA travel.
Whichever bank account you choose,
ﬁnd one that suits YOU. Setting up a
student account at a bank does not
mean you must stick with it for life;
you can change bank accounts every
year.
Finally let’s get down to business:
we’re looking for talented, sexy,
funny writers. If you think you’re like
a muzzle for a duck and ﬁt the bill,
get in touch! Email business.felix@
