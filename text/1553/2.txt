o matter who you are
or where you come
from, you are, to some
extent, proud of this
esteemed institution’s
very high rankings on various scales
and from a variety of scorers around
the world. It helps that the QS League
Tables just got updated earlier this
month to show Imperial rising to its
greatest heights ever – hats oﬀ to Civ.
Eng., how does it feel to be on top of
the world? – just as we all start/resume
our college adventure. (A selection
of up-to-date rankings is shown
in a table if you want to feel good
about yourself while you still can.)
All summer, during and after waiting
around for your offers and crapping
your pants on the eve of Results Day,
you’ve probably done your fair share of
putting down UCL and tried to publicly
believe that Oxbridge don’t know what
they’re missing with you headed here.
Furthermore, with the updated rankings
showing just where we purportedly
stand in the world’s grand scheme of
things, you might have started to believe
you’re something special, headed for
The Chosen College, destined for
greatness and buzzing to meet other
whiz-kids/some legendary old people.
You might expect to be herded into
a factory of educational brilliance
where you enter with A*A*A*A* and
exit with a job at Google/JPMorgan
like clockwork. You might expect
to command awe and respect from
your peers at other institutions just
by telling them where you study. You
might expect Imperial to have all
the best facilities and most modern
technologies implemented on campus
and available for your learning benefit.
You might expect that everyone around
you knows just as much advanced
mathematics and physics as you do.
Of course, rankings are a vague and
generalmeasureofhowwellauniversity
is doing in a broad sense. But, the
above is not what these rankings imply,
or are even necessarily a measure of.
By the time you read this, you may
already have figured that with such
a diverse and international student
body, not everyone has had a similar
educational background. For instance,
engineers may struggle with first-year
Mathematics topics because they hadn’t
taken Further Maths like you had, or
maybe their country’s Maths syllabus
wasn’t as content-heavy. Don’t ever

mistake that for a lack of intelligence
– they worked hard to get here, and
are probably just as deserving as you.
You will notice that criteria such
as ‘Research Excellence’ and ‘Staff-
Student Ratio’, prominent features in
several ranking methodologies will
hardly have any bearing on how your
first few undergraduate years go. The
generous college endowment and
budgets will never really seem to be
trickling down to furnish your lecture
theatre (LT) with swiveling seats
and touchscreen desks. For naming
ourselves the Imperial College of
Science, Technology, and Medicine,
you will see sluggishness in unexpected
places on the technological front – just
keep track of how many months it ends
up taking for every department to have
a couple of LTs to finally be configured
for AV recordings of lectures.
You will come to realise that
unfortunately, top jobs aren’t being
prepared to be handed to you on a plate
once you pass your degree. There are
only a handful of those jobs to begin
with – chances are you won’t be getting
one if you sit around feeling entitled.
That’s why we need, and have, regular
Careers Fairs on campus, for you to find
out that employers do like Imperial, but
hailing from here isn’t enough to make
the cut since they also like Oxbridge,
LSE, the Ivies, etc. You have to do
stuff. Partying twice every week will
look doubly distasteful to employers
if you don’t show you can handle
responsibility and make productive use
of your free time by contributing to a
few Clubs/Societies during your time
here. (Incidentally while I was writing
this, Bloomberg just published an
article saying Imperial graduates now
have the best job prospects in the UK
(89% employed within 6 months of
graduation,aheadofCambridge(85%)).
your year group there are people who
are both smarter and better than you,
who will effortlessly breeze through
exams and coursework in their sleep
while maintaining a social life, and
there are also people slower than you
who will have to put in long shifts after
lectures at the library, poring over the
lecture notes to understand things you
thought were easy enough. You may
identify with the latter group, and
may come to know brighter and more
admirable individuals at other colleges
like UCL or even King’s, who will
greatly trouble your self-esteem and
make you wonder what you are doing
here. But you have to remember, no one
ever said you’re better than other people
just because you’re in Imperial, and it’s
not necessarily true at all. The fact that
you’re here means that the College/
Department admissions team thought
you have great potential on top of your
undoubted academic prowess. Don’t
forget to be humble and keep developing
yourself all the time. Take chances to
learn from anybody and everybody.
That’s why you’re surrounded by
people who don’t necessarily seem
all that amazing. It’s because they’re
not amazing yet, but by the time they
graduate, after they have interacted
with similarly amazing people, they
will be. And hopefully, so will you.
Somewhat in contradiction, you will
have to realise that studying a top-rated
course in a top-rated college won’t
automatically make you awesome, but
people will expect you to be awesome
and be doing awesome things all the
time anyway. You will feel pressurised
to make full use of everything available
to you. Which is when you will start to
doubt what you have around you: “hey
come to think of it, I don’t really feel like
I’m in the world #1 place for my course.
It’s great but…#1? Really? I thought
there would be more than this.” Reality
is always underwhelming, isn’t it?
Unfortunately, the hard truth is that
the only major way you influence
these rankings are through your
National Student Satisfaction (NSS)
survey (when you graduate), and how
quickly you find a job upon graduation.
Most of the score is contributed to by
Postgraduate students and researchers
at the College who are frantically
churning out theses and papers, and to
whom factors like ‘Student-Staff Ratio’
are a whole lot more important in the
hunt for a supervisor. At the end of the
day, it’s generally final-year Undergrads
and more senior people who get to
muck about with the ‘world-class’
facilities the College has, and it’s what
they do that’s published to the world,
and whose quality is judged to form
the main basis of our world rankings.
But all this doesn’t mean Imperial is
a lousy place for an Undergrad to be at
(though I did suggest to you earlier to
feel good about yourself while you still
could.) You’re going to spend between
3-6 years here; most Postgrads are
only here for either 1 or 4 years, plus
you outnumber them 3:1 – it would be
foolish for the College to fail to cater
to you and your abilities…and no one’s
saying it does. This article merely
serves to explain to you what the
currently-published ranking systems do
and do not imply about your Undergrad
experience at Imperial because
they do not factor in much about
Undergraduates. There simply isn’t
any real ranking system for universities
from an Undergraduate perspective out
there (or at least one that’s not exclusive
to US colleges) so we can’t say for sure.
Could Imperial be argued to
be the World #1 University for
Undergraduates? Sure, it’s possible
(though unlikely). But no one’s manage
to agree on a set of standard criteria
to quantify this. Maybe you can try.
