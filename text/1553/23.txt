Y
ou’ll be hearing this a
lot this week but things
were quite diﬀerent
back in my day. My
day was 2008- Metric
was a box called DB’s, Southside and
Eastside were building sites, Facebook
was a new thing and Justin Bieber
was still an embryo. It was amazing.
But as you prepare for the modern
freshers’ week with your smartphones
and status updates and hip-hop music
and all that, there is one thing you will
face that all freshers have faced since
the ﬁrst freshers guzzled WKD from a
hollowed out wooly mammoth tooth;
social interaction.
Social interaction is a terrible thing
and the less of it, the better. I think
we all agree on this. In fact, much of
human existence is spent minimising
the horrors of interacting with other
Homo Sapiens, as demonstrated by
the inventions of walls, monasteries,
earphones and science degrees. But
for the next 7 days you will be forced,
cajoled and conned into interacting
with he Other. Having now looked on
in horror at not one but four Freshers’
Weeks, here’s my guide to How Not To
Make A Complete Idiot Of Yourself.
Donʼt Buy A Kettle
For some reason everyone is told to
bring a kettle with them to university
so you can give out tea and make your
neighbours love you. Don’t. Just don’t.
I don’t like tea and my Northern Irish
accent makes me pronounce “kettle”
in a way that makes English people
laugh at me. Obviously this only
applies to me and not necessarily to
your new neighbours but my physics
degree didn’t teach me to empathise
so just leave that kettle at home.
Donʼt Leave Your Door Open
Again, everyone seems to be told
to leave their door open so new
neighbours can just pop in to say hello
and share stories and eat cupcakes.
No. People cannot be trusted and will
likely steal your stuﬀ. Also they will
laugh at that Final Fantasy poster I
have. I mean you have.
Donʼt Become A Lad
Congratulations, you’ve just left
your expensive private school and
have now met the ﬁrst state educated
person of your life. his does not
entitle you to put on an inexplicable
East London accent, call people “mate”
and refer to your awful conversation
as “banter” or worse, “ban’ah”.
Donʼt Give A Damn And Just Have Fun
Imperial is really bloody hard
work. Nothing you’ve done so far
will prepare you for this. I went from
averaging 98% across my A Levels to
scraping 60% here. Imagine being
repeatedly and viciously beaten
around the head by a thick metal bar.
hat bar represents knowledge and
the sick bastard wielding it is this
university. his is what your next 3-4
years will entail. Imperial will now
spend two weeks wiping the blood
and tears of last year’s students from
that metal bar. Take advantage of
the lull. Talk to strangers. Take shots
from a cereal bowl. Join every club
and society. Don’t sleep. Steal a traﬃc
cone. Buy a top hat. Take one step
inside an embassy and revel in the
thrill of having one leg in Britain and
the other in Yemen. Return the traﬃc
cone out of social responsibility.
he world is your oyster. For two
weeks. And then that oyster will be
cracked open and swallowed whole,
sliding slowly but inexorably down the
gullet of this prestigious institution.
Enjoy it while you can.
