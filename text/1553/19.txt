Tuesday 1 October, 11am - 4pm
Freshers‚Äô Fair is the biggest activities event of the year that transforms
our South Kensington Campus into a showcase of every Club, Society and
Project at Imperial College Union. If you‚Äôre not already planning on coming,
I deÔ¨Ånitely recommend doing so to see the huge variety of what‚Äôs on offer,
get some freebies and soak up the fantastic atmosphere.
Each year, thousands of students attend the fair, visiting many of the 300+
stalls that each Club, Society & Project get to promote their group, hold
demonstrations, give out freebies and chat to students. Stalls are clustered
by type so if you‚Äôre a fan of the outdoors or a keen musician, you should
be able to Ô¨Ånd the groups associated with those pursuits all in one area.
However, I strongly advise you to make an effort to visit each area. We‚Äôre
incredibly proud of the diversity and dedication of our groups, allowing
students to pursue almost any interest they can imagine, so make sure you
take full advantage of this. University is the best time to try new things and
meet new people so just go for it, you might be interested in something
completely new!
At Freshers‚Äô Fair we operate a strict no trading policy, so you won‚Äôt part
with any money on the day. Instead the groups will encourage you to sign
up to their mailing lists so that you can be kept informed of when they are
meeting and what they‚Äôre up to. Don‚Äôt worry about signing up to too many
as it‚Äôs easy to unsubscribe once you‚Äôve decided which groups you‚Äôd like to
remain involved with ‚Äì initially the best idea is to keep your options open.
Give It A Go (GIAG) is a taste of what many of the Clubs, Societies &
Projects offer with free or cheap taster sessions, events and activities
following Freshers‚Äô Fair. This is a great opportunity to try things out and
meet students involved before you commit to buying membership. Keep an
eye out for the calendar of fun events and activities on our website!
If you do miss any early meetings or events, don‚Äôt worry as you can get
in touch with groups via the contact details, join a group or sign up to a
mailing list at any time of the year! And once you have decided which
Clubs, Societies or Projects you want to join, many require you to pay a
membership fee to join but doing so is easy. This can all be done on our
website imperialcollegeunion.org.
Enjoy the Fair and I look forward to meeting many of you on the day!
