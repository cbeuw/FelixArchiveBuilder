CAMPUS FOOD
T
here are lots of places
to stuﬀ your face like a
greedy pig (with glasses
on) around campus. Some
are even super new so
it’s an adventure. Okay, not a good
adventure like accidentally walking
into an all super model nudist colony,
but an adventure nonetheless.
Union (1)
hey serve lunch and dinner food.
he food is cheap and almost cheerful.
Well. It’s more cheerful than a man
with vertigo standing on the top of the
Shard. hat’s something. Nachos is a
good call and the bar staﬀ are all nice.
Eastside (2)
Just below Eastside Halls, it’s a
posh pub, although looks more like
an American bar. Serves pretty good
food at lunch and dinner that is veggie
friendly and meat lover friendly too.
he prices are low enough that they
probably won’t leave you oﬀering £2
massages on High Street Ken just to
get by. So that’s a plus.
JCR
his is, realistically, where you’ll
end up eating most days. It has all
you could want and more. A bunch
of sandwiches, a deli bar (which is
actually surprisingly good) and even
a pie and mash/salad bar shop. Back
in the day you could do the mash
yourself, now they check, just incase
you scam them out of 5p’s worth of
potato. You’ve been warned. here’s
also a fast food counter, if you’re into
that sort of thing. By that, I mean
rejected KFC food. here’s a pancake
place too, but they aren’t proper
crepes really: it’s essentially rubber
with some Nutella on top. Yum yum.
QTR
If you want hot food then this is
your place to go. It always has a noodle
based option, and a meal deal. You get
a drink, dessert and a main for pretty
cheap. Word of warning though: if
you get a hot dessert eat it ﬁrst so it
doesn’t end up going cold – made that
mistake too many times. If you want
to be a true pro, and piss oﬀ the chef a
bit, ask for an omelette.
Library Cafe
Why would I need to go here? I
won’t be in the Library long enough to
need sustenance. I’ll be out raving with
Tinie Tempah and the other freshers.
From semester to semester. Where do
you think you are? UCL? Nah, you’ll
actually be doing work and stuﬀ. So,
sorry to say, but, this will become
a main eatery. It has all the energy
drinks you could want (and many
you don’t want). Plus it has wraps
that probably won’t kill you. here’s
also the infamous jacket potatos. I
heard tell of a couple breaking up
after sharing one in the Library Cafe.
Possibly they broke up because he
wanted beans and she wanted cheese
and the two together just didn’t work.
hat became a metaphor for their
failing relationship and it had to end.
Or one of them cheated on the other.
Either way, at least they were full at
the end of it. he legends working
there pile on the cheese and beans to
heroic amounts. So take advantage.
Department Cafes
Loads of departments have their
own cafes. Essentially small counters
with tea, coﬀee, sandwiches and
drinks. he SAF Cafe is pretty good.
he Business School one too. he
others are great for a cheeky chocolate
bar to eat in lectures while you try to
understand if it is maths or a foreign
language being written on the board.
SCR
his is only for postgrads and
lecturers, unfortunately. However,
the breakfast is for all. How liberal of
them. If you can drag yourself in early
enough, give it a go. It’s amazingly
cheap and they have everything
you could want. he hash browns
are gorgeous. You’re missing out if
you don’t go. Honestly, try this: pile
your plate with everything you could
imagine eating. Go to the checkout.
Be amazed at how it is still under £5.
Other
College will be changing some areas
by the time you get here so look for-
ward to the new “College Cafe” near
the main entrance and a new outlet in
the JCR!
NEAR CAMPUS
FOOD
B
ored of eating the
same rotation of three
sandwiches and a Twix
for lunch and dinner every
day? Well you should be.
But never fear, there are tales of places
not near the Library where one can
eat.
The Sandwich Shop (9)
his is like a mature student who
sucks up to a lecturer: an old favourite.
More accurately, though, it’s like a
shop that has a bewildering amount
of sandwich choices. here’s also
Greenﬁeld’s near South Ken station
for an artisan sandwich. he goat’s
cheese one is a solid bet.
Caffe Forum
his place has possibly the best
pizzas in London. hey are thin and
yummy. Plus, between 4-7pm they
are all £5, no matter what size you
get. Amazing right? Also have a large
selection of pastas, quiches, and some
sandwiches. If you want a morning
perk, go for a coﬀee and get a free
croissant. Near Gloucester Road is
also he Diner, and a Neros (23) with
the comﬁest sofas ever. Great for
doing work in a chilled environment.
High Street Ken
here’s anything you could want
here. Wagamamas (32) is a good
shout – free green tea is a plus. Giraﬀe
(31) are incredibly friendly and have
a special Imperial deal (they did last
year, don’t kill me if it is no longer
there). Just show your College card for
a discount. Of course there’s also all
the big chains around too.
South Ken
Oriental Canteen (14) and
Chopstix (15) are great for a quick
(erm, oily) snack.
