Ahead of you, dear reader, be you
fresher or a returning student, is
a substantial (or perhaps not so
substantial) amount of work. To
provide some relief from the never
ending coursework and lab reports,
this article will try to introduce you
to some games that will serve you
well this year, without breaking the
bank. hese games, while not the
newest you will ever see, have a lot
of replay value and are easily worth
their money. In fact, comparing
them to some of the new stuﬀ out
there, I would take these any day. I
try to split these beauties into their
diﬀerent genres, so that you get a
quick overview of the games on hand.
Game: Minecraft
Price: 20€ on the website (for PC/
Mac version)
Platform: PC, Mac, Xbox 360, iOS
and Android
If you haven’t heard of Minecraft,
then you should get out from under
that rock you have been living
under. It has been the sensation of
the indie gaming world, propelling
its creator Magnus (Notch) Persson
to game-creator stardom. In fact it
has been so successful that several
characters and features of the
game have entered popular culture.
he idea behind this game, is that you
are a blockheaded character, who is
stranded in a cube world and must
survive in any way. Simple, right?
And that is the greatest feature of this
Game:
CounterStrike

Offensive
Price: £13.99/£11.99 on steam
Platform: PC and Mac
game, it is easy to play and you can
play anyway you want. If you want to
be a rugged explorer, a creative artist
or an ingenious redstone (electricity
equivalent) engineer this game allows
you to do exactly that. his freedom
and lack of pressure is liberating, and is
agreatwaytowinddownafteranexam
(or even before if you feel foolhardy).
A great thing about this game is the
fact that you get free updates pretty
much from the point you bought it,
which means every so often something
new will come in that will change
your game experience. Furthermore
the modding society is very active as
well, meaning if you do ever get bored
there are tons of things to look for!
his game is for all those casual
gamers looking for a game that won’t
break the bank and that is relatively
easy in terms of learning curve, yet
very engrossing. Even for all you
It is hard to believe that this game
started out as a mod of half life. It
was so successful as a mod, that it
made it into its own game. his is
pretty much the big daddy of all
modern FPSs and really should not
be missed out if you are a fan of that
genre. With Valve’s Source engine,
these two versions are really top
notch games that can perform at
comfortable levels for most PCs.
here is no story or anything of the
sort. he only thing you do is sign
on to various servers (community or
oﬃcial) that have diﬀerent types of
game modes. It varies from the casual
gun game, to the very competitive
oﬃcial hostage/defuse missions. hen
youplayroundsbasedonthosemodes.
his way of playing is very eﬀective
and entertaining, as you don’t really
need to invest a lot of time for a lot
of fun. At the start you may have to
learn the ways of the game, but after
that its all very well balanced. he
fact that you can drop in and out
of servers, as well as the fact that
each round on average lasts about 5
minutes max, means that this game
can be used perfectly for that short
study break that you aﬀord yourself.
One of the reasons that this game
will rack up the hours is the input of
the community, which is very vibrant
in both GO (Global Oﬀensive) and
Source, and has lead to multiple
modiﬁcations of the standard
Counter-terrorist versus terrorist
default modes. You can go from the
most casual sniper deathmatches, to
very intense zombie maps very easily.
Getting one of these games is the
easy choice, the hard part is deciding
which one. Source has a bigger
community, as well as having bigger
variations on the defaults modes, and
seems less buggy. Global Oﬀensive
(cheaper one) is newer, has better
graphics, and handy oﬃcial servers
as well as the community ones. Also
the learning curve is a bit gentler for
the initiate. However in the end it
doesn’t really matter which one you
get, you will pour a ton of time into it.

Of all the games I have talked about,
this one here is my favourite and
possiblytheonethatmostpeoplewon’t
know, which is quite a shame. Made
by the turkish studio TaleWorlds, this
indie game perfectly captures that
adventure feeling. Basically you are an
adventurer dumped in the medieval
lands of Calradia, and you can do what
you like. Want to go and marry one of
the local beauties? Go ahead. Want
hardcore battleﬁeld and COD players
- try it, you may actually like it!
