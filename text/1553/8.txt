‘The Imperial Thing’: Why Comment Matters
T
here are people out there
that are highly critical
of the ethos of Imperial
College and its approach
to academic pursuits.
Some individuals from outside the
institution ﬁnd it ‘lacking’ in certain
qualities. hey often attempt to
draw parallels between ourselves
and the University of Oxford or
the University of Cambridge. Be it
the lack of stunning architecture,
the skewed gender balance or its
unrealised ‘brand’ they choose to
draw upon every negative fathomable
and consider us gauche, unreﬁned and
imbalanced. his provides the Raison
D’être of Felix Comment; Imperial
College needs to utilise every voice
possible in order to ward oﬀ and
rise above these criticisms. Every
voice matters. Your voice matters.
In the coming academic year Felix
Comment (managed by my colleague
Tessa Davey and me) will publish a
number of articles in line with the
contemporary developments aﬀecting
theCollegeandindeedthewiderworld
on a weekly basis. It will be our task to
convey balanced credit and criticism
in relation to any academic, socio-
political or cultural developments
within Imperial College; we cannot
do justice to this duty as an isolated
entity. he newspaper is merely a
focus of the information relevant
to over ten thousand students, staﬀ
and academics. Felix Comment
acts as their conduit, a platform
upon which their opinions and
convictions can be revealed in the
public arena. Past articles submitted
have varied signiﬁcantly. Some have
been casual in tone, others have
sparked controversy but all have been
equally valid; it is discussion and
debate that truly makes a university.
When analysing Imperial College
as a whole it appears to be more
than a school. It is a community.
You might care to draw parallels
with ancient Athenian democracy,
which centred on the polis. It was
a world founded on variety and
continuous evolution, where politics
and theatre were considered equals.
Its fuel was debate and discussion,
creating the cornerstones of sport,
art, philosophy and medicine, to
name but a few. A series of solitudes
were connected to create the
recognisable whole. It was a system
that ventured into new frontiers…and
yet it was more than that. To quote
Dr. Richard Miles, senior lecturer in
Classics at the University of Sydney,
‘he polis was something you
belonged to, the place that gave you
an identity.
’
his is the chief strength of Imperial
College; our thoughts, ideas and
voices will prove to be our enduring
legacy, our integral link between one
another. You may be an engineer, a
geologist or a medic but there are
shared interests and ideals between
us all. Any ﬂaw in the university can
be overcome by interaction, which
can ultimately deliver progress.
Felix Comment is just one of many

otten
avenues that can facilitate this.
Each student inherits insane
volumesofwork(andifyou’reafresher,
believe me, you will) and are therefore
subject to common stresses and trials.
In many cases resentment spawns
and it is often amassed on a College-
wide, rather than Departmental,
basis. A solution to a problem takes
time, working its way up from the
individual, through the Students’
Union and into the upper echelons
of Imperial College. his process
of debate often needs a catalyst;
Felix Comment has recurrently
provided this over the years.
While students at the College
have common interests they are
balanced by a rich and dynamic
multiculturalism unrivalled by any
academic institution in the UK.
his, for me, epitomises the need
for commentary. he students and
staﬀ possess inﬁnitely many links to
global issues and thus the need to talk
about them arises. Civil war, tyranny
and poverty have often aﬀected the
families of students and staﬀ who
study away from their homeland. he
duty has often fallen to Felix Comment
(and Felix as a whole) to galvanise
condolence, sympathy or support for
these people in their hour of need.
he previous academic year of
2012-2013 was riddled with tragedy,
with the rapidly evolving Syrian
crisis a case in point. Such events
served to highlight that each and
every one of us has been attracted
at Imperial College for a reason,
underpinned by an aspiration for self-
betterment through the medium of a
technical education. he buildings,
the people and the community are
the centrepiece of it all. Discussion
in the direction of their improvement
cannot fail be a good thing.
Fortunately Felix Comment also
deals with light-hearted matters.
Previous topics of debate have
ranged from that of climate change
to the introduction of the ‘Grade
Point Average’ system. Such vast
and extensive topics have provided
sumptuous material for debate. he
comment section has repeatedly
demonstrated that the mechanisms
of discussion, that vital threshing
and contention, can provide more
satisfaction than the outcome itself.
In order to end on a positive note I
havecontactedanumberofindividuals
from diﬀerent branches of life within
Imperial College, asking them to give
a brief synopsis of what has made
their University opportunities truly
great. hey bear witness to the many
advantagesawardedbyourCollegeand
demonstrate that we can be proud of it.
It is our very own polis. By
enmeshing ourselves with its ebb
and ﬂow it might just become the
place that forges our future identity.
One way of doing that is to keep in
touch with Felix. If you feel a need to
vocalise any issue, no matter how big
or small, e-mail the team at comment.
felix@imperial.ac.uk and we will
endeavour to help within our means.
To close I shall quote the
Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney.
Between my finger and my thumb
he Squat pen rests.
I’ll dig with it.

mperial
has given me
the opportunity
to encounter people from
a range of different and diverse
backgrounds, all of whom are united
by a desire to excel…The network I
have built will remain with me long after
graduation.”

University of Cambridge and Imperial
Alumnus
T
he UROP placement has
given me an insight into
the everyday life of an academic
researcher, increased my knowledge about
topics relevant to my degree…It will be a good
thing to have as experience when applying for
internships and jobs in the future.

wo years ago I did my Erasmus at Imperial and I was able to experience world-class research, meet fantastic people
and live in one of the coolest cities in the world. And when you have the possibility to do your Ph.D. in this place, why
wouldnʼt you?
Richard, Prospective PhD student
T
he opportunity to
study for a year abroad
is deﬁnitely something I
would recommend. Not
only do you get
to taste a different
environment, for
academia as well as
fun times, but it does
not even delay your
graduation, which is
both rare and valuable.

Engineering on a
