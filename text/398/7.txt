FELICITY
RCSU Skin-diver
arrested!
Last Saturday, during their rag c o l l e c t i o n ,
one member of RCS was picked-up by a p o l i c e -
man. Besides t h i s i n c i d e n t , the c o l l e c t i o n
was f a i r l y peaceful with a few t o u r i s t s
taking pot shots at the multitude of umbrel-
las .
The rank and f i l e of RCS started t h e i r
outing with a Kangala and proceeded to wake-
up Southside. After a r r i v i n g at the Harrods
area, the crowd spread out and in no time a l l
exits from Harrods were covered. As usual,
the scrooges were out in force, so c o l l e c t i n g
was not too easy. The weather did not help
e i t h e r ; by 11.30am most c o l l e c t o r s were h a l f -
frozen. There was competition too, as the
c o l l e c t o r s from the mentally disabled group
came to town as w e l l , which sort of saturated
the area. However, when people t r i e d the
B r i t i s h Heart Foundation approach as opposed
to the Underwater B r o l l y Con, they received
donations of up to 50p! One t o u r i s t , obvious-
ly annoyed at the c o l l e c t i o n , decided to take
i t out on the poor defenseless umbrellas, at
least one umbrella was s l i g h t l y bent a f t e r -
wards .
By 12 noon, most people had decided to
c a l l i t a day. Most; but not one David
Rawnsley, who ventured up to Oxford Street
i n h i s wet-suit and proceeded to c o l l e c t
from the ones who donated so kindly a f o r t -
night ago. While he was persuading a few
persons at a bus-stop near Marble Arch, he
was picked-up by a p l a i n - c l o t h e s policeman.
This was at about 12.50pm.
The policeman told Mr Rwansley that he was
obstructing the Queen's highway and took his
c o l l e c t i n g can away from him. In doing so.
the label blew-off the can while i n the
policeman's hand. He was then taken to the
p o l i c e s t a t i o n where he was t o l d that he
could be charged with o b s t r u c t i o n , not having
the label on his c o l l e c t i n g can f i r m l y
affixed and not having a proper licence (the
licence he held was a house-to-house one as
opposed to a street one).
After being held for an hour, he was t o l d
that the charge of obstruction had been
dropped. He was not charged with either of
the remaining two offences. However, the
p o l i c e said that they would check with the
RCSU on the labels and the l i c e n s e s .

FELICITY
This week, due to our v a r y t y p i s t G i l l having
f a l l e n i l l , we are only producing a mini
FELIX c a l l e d FELICITY. We hope to bounce
back with a bumper issue next week. I should
l i k e to apologise to a l l contributors for not
being able to include t h e i r a r t i c l e s t h i s
week. A l s o , I would l i k e to thank Pat, the
Union t y p i s t , for her help i n typing material
for t h i s issue.
Education Cuts
Next Tuesday sees the f i r s t major a c t i o n to
oppose the Public Expenditure cuts which the
government has implemented as part of i t s
measures to curb i n f l a t i o n . The Education
sector, being an easy target, has borne the
brunt of these cuts in public spending and i n
the short term, many people might think this
to be a good move. However, in the long
term, when hopefully the economy w i l l have
revived, there is no guarantee that these
cuts w i l l be restored and an increase i n
education spending w i l l take place.
On the contrary, we are faced with further
government proposals to slash another Â£500
m i l l i o n over the next four years from the
educational budget. The form the cuts have
taken are outlined i n the P r e s i d e n t ' s a r t i c l e
devoted to t h i s very c r u c i a l t o p i c . These
include a 50% reduction i n new b u i l d i n g pro-
grammes for u n i v e r s i t i e s . This has an
immediate l o c a l consequence for every student
in this College. It means that the College
does not have the money to b u i l d new h a l l s of
residence or to provide a l t e r n a t i v e accomoda>-
t i o n for IC students.
This example i l l u s t r a t e s the need for
every student at IC to f u l l y understand the
nature and implications of the government's
p o l i c y as regards education, not only at a
l o c a l l e v e l , but at a national l e v e l . It i s
therefore up to you to begin to question
these abortive steps which i n the long run
can only lead to a massive lowering of
educational standards.
Thus I would urge you to attend the r a l l y
and lobby of Parliament on Tuesday, 21st Oct.
It may not be the best way to pursue the
fight against the cuts, but i t i s one way and
only by your p a r t i c i p a t i o n can a better and
more meaningful resistance be b u i l t - u p .
This i s open i n Room at the Top, at the top
of the Union Building every lunch-time betweai
12.30 and 1.30pm. (Mon-Fri)
