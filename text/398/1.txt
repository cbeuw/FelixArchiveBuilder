F O U N D E D IN 1949 NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
No. 398 Friday 17jth October, 1975. F R E E :
IC student assaulted
by gang of thugs
A member of the Imperial College Dramatic
Society was b r u t a l l y assaulted by a gang of
four youths during the early hours of last
Sunday morning. The incident took place
opposite Gloucester Road tube s t a t i o n as the
student was making h i s way back to Evelyn
Gardens.
Pushed against barrier
The student, who had been working l a t e
designing sets for Dramsoc's Christmas
production; 'The Captain of Kopenick', was
d e l i b e r a t e l y pushed against the pedestrian
b a r r i e r s . He picked himself up after crashing
to the ground and muttered something to the
youths as he walked away.
Beaten severely
Two of the youths, who were s t i l l within ear-
shot, then chased him and caught him. They
then proceeded to beat him severely about the
face and body. He was kicked several times
in the r i b s and stomach.
Youths challenged
Eight foreign young men who happened to be
passing by challenged the youths who promptly
ran o f f i n the d i r e c t i o n of Cromwell Road.
Five of them gave chase, but l o s t the gang
at the junction of Gloucester Road and
Cromwell Road.
Police called
The IC student, who by t h i s time was bleeding
quite heavily from the nose and mouth, then
made h i s way back to the Union B u i l d i n g . He
was met by Riz Shakir, ICU Deputy President,
who had just returned from a l a t e excursion.
The p o l i c e were c a l l e d and the student taken
to h o s p i t a l for an X-ray and treatment of h i s
b r u i s e s .
Case dropped
The p o l i c e who have been i n v e s t i g a t i n g the
case have now dropped i t . This i s due to the
fact that they have not got a good enough
d e s c r i p t i o n of the youths and thus cannot put
out a 'wanted' n o t i c e for them. The student
involved has decided not to prefer charges
after meeting with p o l i c e o f f i c e r s yesterday
to discuss the matter.
W2 burgled
Twenty-seven c a l c u l a t o r s , which were chained
to desks i n room 215 of the new Huxley
B u i l d i n g s , were stolen last Friday evening.
The c a l c u l a t o r s are made by Advance E l e c -
tronics L t d . and are of the Executive 16/R
range. Their t o t a l value has been put at
Â£3,039.
The c a l c u l a t o r s , which are bigger than the
Hewlett-Packard 45, were discovered missing
at 10.45pm. by a security guard who was doing
his rounds. The doors to room 215 had been
forced and the chains securing the c a l c u -
l a t o r s to the desks had been cut.
That the burglary took place between 7.00pm.
and 11.00pm. i s c e r t a i n because the s e c u r i t y
guard who discovered the theft had checked
and locked the door to room 215 at 7.00pm.
It seems obvious from the mode of entry
that the burglar or burglars knew the
b u i l d i n g f a i r l y well and the burglary i t s e l f
would have taken no more than f i v e to ten
minutes.
