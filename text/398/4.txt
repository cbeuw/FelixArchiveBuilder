Education Cuts - the way to cure inflation?
a c h i l d i n education, they are s e r i o u s l y
affected. It i s hoped that these movements
together with NUS w i l l be able to exert
s u f f i c i e n t pressure on the government to
d i r e c t i t away from public expenditure cuts.
It i s also the i n t e n t i o n of NUS to give the
issues as much p u b l i c i t y as possible and try
to engender a response from the general
p u b l i c . To t h i s end, and also to educate
the NUS membership to the f u l l consequences
of the c u t s , weeks of a c t i o n are being
organised between 27th October and 7th Nov-
ember. This may include some form of
national demonstration. The f i r s t major
event taking place on the cuts issue i s the
"Save Education" R a l l y , March, and Lobby of
Parliament on 21st October. This has been
organised by the South East Regional Council
of the TUC. The assembly point is at
"Reformers' Tree" near Speakers Corner at
2pm. The r a l l y w i l l move off at 2.45pm.
This demonstration i s followed i n the evening
by a " R a l l y for Education" organised by the
Council for Educational Advance i n the
Central H a l l Westminster from 7pm. t i l l 9pm.
No t i c k e t s are required j u s t turn up.
Further d e t a i l s on both of these are a v a i l -
able from me i n the Union O f f i c e .
Conclusion
The Education Cuts issue i s one that should
be of i n t e r e s t to us a l l . I hope to be able
to provide some more information as how the
campaign i s progressing. Any r e a c t i o n to
t h i s a r t i c l e w i l l be most welcome.

Arising
Having

meeting
back to
here ar
UGM.
crawled out of my death-bed, I now find
recovering from the shock of a council
f i n i s h i n g at 8.45pm.' I think I ' l l go
the Health Centre. Be that as i t may,
e a few tender morsals for your perusal
The next UGM i s on Tuesday next. The elections
for a large number of Union posts w i l l take
place, and i f you're at a l l interested i n
helping the Union t h i s year, have a look at
the notice board i n the Union Lower Lounge,
and see which posts are up for e l e c t i o n .
A l s o , the UGM w i l l see the re-emergence of the
Union P o l i c y Statement. This document should
have been presented at the AGM l a s t year, but
i t was missed out. For the benefit of
Freshers, t h i s document i s a c h r o n i c l e of a l l
Union P o l i c i e s from 1962. It i s e s p e c i a l l y
useful at NUS Conference, etc, for delegates
to use as guidelines when v o t i n g . Copies are
a v a i l a b l e from the Union O f f i c e . At the
meeting you w i l l be asked to accept i t as a
true record of Union P o l i c y at the present
time. If you disagree with the contents, then
present a motion to a UGM to change i t .
Hall Insurance
The present p o l i c y covers theft by any meens,
acts of God, etc i n a l l College H a l l s , Houses,
and F l a t s . It only covers belongings in your
room. If you want a d d i t i o n a l cover, say for
a c a l c u l a t o r which you carry with you, go
down to Endsleigh on Old Brompton Road, and
get an " A l l R i s k s " quotation.
Parking
The committee has met, and allocated places.
If you haven't c o l l e c t e d your permit yet do
so today, as the appeals committee meets
next week to a l l o c a t e the remaining spaces.
NUS Mail Order
A new NUS Service has started; a mail order
company. It is very much " i n embryo" at the
moment, but i t has pursued the p o l i c y of
getting " q u a l i t y products at enonomic prices".
Have a look at the sheets spread around
college for further d e t a i l s . If you want to
buy a c a l c u l a t o r , come up to the Union Office,
and get put on the l i s t , as they prefer bulk
orders. A l s o , i f anyone has any ideas for
expanding t h e i r range, l e t me know, as they
seem very anxious to please at the moment.
That i s i t for now, toute va bien and a l l
that. See you around. John Downs.
