Price increases
necessary-Mr.Mooney
In an interview featured i n STOIC's new
programme "Lunchbreak", shown l a s t Thursday
(Oct. 9th), Mr Mooney, catering manager for
IC, defended the recent 40% p r i c e r i s e s i n
the r e f e c t o r i e s . He said that since 1967
there had been a 200% increase in the s t a f f ' s
wages, while prices had gone up by only 98%.
When asked to comment on the charge of poor
food q u a l i t y , he r e p l i e d that this was a
subjective matter, and opinions of what
tastes good vary from one person to another.
He said he would welcome the enquiry which
was demanded at the l a s t Union meeting. He
added that the l a s t three enquiries had given
the r e f e c t o r i e s a clean b i l l of health.
Peter Teague, however, i n r e p l y i n g on
behalf of the Union, said that while i t i s
possible that the r e f e c t o r i e s might be
favourably reviewed by an enquiry, the l a s t
one had been more than fjve years ago, and
conditions may have changed since then.

Following the success of last year's sweepstake,
this venture will be continued, to finance an Easter
tour. The sweepstake operates by taking the first 20
rugby results from the 'Sunday Express'and numbering
them from 1 to 20. Each participant in the sweepstake
is allocated three of these numbers. The person with
the numbers corresponding to the highest aggregate of
points each week, wins £5.
The weekly entry fee is 10p and for the 25 Saturdays
of the College season the gentry fee is £2.50. A L L
club members are urged to participate to ensure a good
profit to finance the tour.
