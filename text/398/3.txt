Education Cuts-the way to cure inflation?

The History of Education Cuts
The present Education Cuts must be seen i n ,
the context of the o v e r a l l Public expenditure
cuts, as one of the main government t a c t i c s
for dealing with the high rate of i n f l a t i o n .
F i r s t l y much of the public expenditure is
non-productive and does not generate consump-
t i o n , and secondly i t is often financed on
c r e d i t which of i t s e l f is i n f l a t i o n a r y .
The present s e r i e s of cuts began i n 1973,
reducing current spending by 10% and c a p i t a l
programmes by 20%. As a r e s u l t many educat-
ional i n s t i t u t i o n s had less money to spend
i n 1974-75 than i n 1973-74, despite large
increases i n the cost of equipment etc. In
the Budget presented by Denis Healey i n A p r i l
1975 a further £86 m i l l i o n was lopped off the
expenditure on education, a r t s , science and
l i b r a r i e s . Since then the Chancellor has
revealed that he plans to cut a further £1250
m i l l i o n from Public Spending. According to
the "Times Higher Education Supplement", t h i s
would e n t a i l cuts of £500 m i l l i o n i n educat-
ion spending, spread over the next four year*.
This w i l l mean that education spending w i l l
only increase by 1.6% t h i s year, and w i l l
a c t u a l l y decrease by 1.3% next year. Remember
that with about 25% i n f l a t i o n t h i s means that
the r e a l value of the money spent on educat-
ion w i l l f a l l by 23.4% t h i s year, and 26.3%
next year, i f the rate of i n f l a t i o n is sus-
tained .
The effects of the cuts
The form which the education cuts take v a r i e s
considerably from area to area as the imple-
mentation of the cuts is l a r g e l y a matter for
d e c i s i o n by Local A u t h o r i t i e s . The following
are some examples:
* Teacher Training supply targets cut by
54,000 places.
* Closure of 13 Colleges of Education.
* Reduction i n the number and value of
d i s c r e t i o n a r y awards, eg Some a u t h o r i t i e s
are not i s s u i n g any more d i s c r e t i o n a r y
awards.
* Shelving of plans to replace school and
college b u i l d i n g s .
* Cuts in e f f e c t i v e grants to U n i v e r s i t i e s .
* Plans to employ less than t h e i r quota of
teachers i n some 20 l o c a l a u t h o r i t i e s ,
hence increasing the size of school classes
* A complete s t a n d s t i l l i n the p r o v i s i o n of
Nursery Education, despite the fact that we
have the worst p r o v i s i o n i n Europe.
As you can see from the items l i s t e d above
which do not cover a l l those things being cut
t h i s amounts to a d i r e c t attack on the
standard of education that we have at present
Should Education Be Cut ?
Educational spending i s a p a r t i c u l a r l y
easy f i e l d to cut since the cuts
in spending produce no d r a s t i c r e s u l t s immed-
i a t e l y , as cuts in say the health service
would. Cuts i n the Education Services are a
p a r t i c u l a r l y short - sighted way of attempt-
ing to solve an economic c r i s i s . They necess-
a r i l y involve a diminution of future prospects
for economic growth. When the economy begins
to get on the move again we w i l l need educated
people at a l l levels to man the economy. These
people w i l l not be a v a i l a b l e i f we continue to
cut spending on education as we are c u t t i n g
both the numbers of people that can be educat-
ed, and also the l e v e l of education.
It i s easy to condemn cuts i n education spend-
ing and provide no a l t e r n a t i v e philosophy.
Cuts i n other areas of public edpenditure are
favoured i n some quarters. The National
Union of Students subscribe to the lobby which
favours increased public spending, lower un-
employment, free c o l l e c t i v e bargaining, and
import c o n t r o l s , as the s o l u t i o n to our p r e -
sent economic c r i s i s . I do not wholeheartedly
subscribe to t h i s view.
What relevance to IC?
Having read t h i s you may be asking what
relevance do the cuts i n education spending
have to I.C.? The effects i n any one college
are d i f f i c u l t to itemise. College has not
received as much money as expected from the
government, and because of t h i s the d e p a r t -
ments and administration were subject to two
separate cuts each of two per cent. This
money has to be saved somehow. In the
administration appointments of replacement
s t a f f are being ' f r o z e n ' where ever possible.
This means either a heavier burden on the
remaining staff complement, or that work
becomes delayed. In the departments a large
proportion of expenditure i s also committed
to s a l a r i e s and the areas easiest to cut are
demonstrating and the a l l o c a t i o n for h o s p i -
t a l i t y i e . the s o c i a l side of the department.
Thus far the College has managed to bear
the cuts exceedingly w e l l due to considerable
hard work i n f i n a n c i a l planning and strategy.
How much longer t h i s can continue i s a
question of pure conjecture.
The National Campaign.
One of the c e n t r a l points of the campaign
organised by NUS is to a l l y with the Labour
and Trade Union movements. These groups are
both very powerful and as the cuts affect
every person who i s i n education, or who has
