Council Report
The 195th IC Union Council meeting chaired
by Pete Teague, began just before 6.00pm on
Monday.
There was no major news. Mr Downs had
received a l e t t e r from Mr Mohindra, Chairman
of the Overseas Students Committee, tendering
his resignation due to personal circumstances.
The President's report included news on
h a l l s and r e f e c t o r i e s . The advice to
students to eat elsewhere appears to have
been heeded, judging by Mr Mooney's quote:
"Refectories have never been t h i s empty at
this time before". As regards h a l l s , the
rent w i l l be reviewed and put to the Gover-
nors at a meeting on Dec. 18th, to be
implemented after Christmas. However,.,
objections were raised over having m i d -
sessional p r i c e increases, whereas grants
are reviewed only annually.
There was also d i s c u s s i o n as to how many
observers to send to future NUS conferences,
as i t i s normally three, but the cost per
head i s £35.
ICWA: The FLATSHARE scheme run i n the
l a s t two weeks of the vacation proved to be
a great success, with not only female
students being catered for as was the
o r i g i n a l idea. The problem of residence
t h i s year was aggravated by the fact that
the Residence O f f i c e r f a i l e d his exams and
consequently the p o s i t i o n was l e f t vacant.
It is hoped that the scheme w i l l be run next
year on a larger scale.
In AOB, Mr Abraham, acting PGAO, proposed
that writing-up students (PG's staying on
after t h e i r time for about three months to
f i n i s h w r i t i n g t h e i r theses) should be given
the status of registered students for the
purpose of using Union f a c i l i t i e s . This was
accepted.
The most noteworthy fact about t h i s
meeting was that the meeting had only taken
two hours and forty minutes- the shortest
Council meeting ever held in IC.
