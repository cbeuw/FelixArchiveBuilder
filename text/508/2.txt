Dear Sir. - The last two editions of
F E L I X have both contained
references to the use of Abortion,
and both have been equally
extreme, but opposite, in their
views. Last week's F E L I X (No.
3071
contained a letter supporting
the "'Positive Alternatives T o
Abortion"' cult. It began by
stating that life begins at
conception, and that any attempt
at discussing this point is both
i r r a t i o n a l a n d i m p o s s i b l e .
Furthermore, that "there tire no
serious grounds for saying that life
begins after conception.''
Since the entire P A T A
philosophy rests on this point, it is
worthy of considerable thought.
T h e pre-natal development
of a child can be seen as a
continuum of events, during
which modifications are done on a
molecular scale to a bsic unit. For
instance, matter is accumulated
to form the egg. which is modified
on release, further modified at
conception, and subsequently
modified a very large number of
times before it's even ready to be
born. let alone afterwards.
Looking at it in this "discrete'"
way (I hope you will forgive my
model shows that the P A T A
have chosen one such modifi-
cation as their origin, and yet it is
no more dramatic a modification
than any of the others.
What about all the partially
completed humans that are lost so
regularly because we haven't
allowed them to have just that
modification or any of the
subsequent ones? That is as m u c h
"compulsory euthanasia'' as
abortion is.
Surely there are grounds for
proposing that life begins after
c o n c e p t i o n ? In p a r t i c u l a r ,
perhaps the largest step in the
development is when the child
ceases to be a subsidiary of its
mother's circulatory system and
begins to function as a living
human being by breathing.
Before this takes place the
foetus still has to be given a
final modification before it
can become a living child.
After this has occurred the child
is no longer dependent on the
mother who created it - her place
could be taken by anyone, be they
nurse, father, etc ' b u t a
different personality may. of
course, result).
I would agree that the use of
abortion to reduce the number of
handicapped children is bad. the
reason being that handicapped
people can enjoy life as much as
others (and no doubt they have a
better appreciation of life than
most of us).
However, it is surely not evil
to use a b o r t i o n for the
t e r m i n a t i o n of u n w a n t e d
pregnancies in circumstances
where the child could not be
satisfactorily supported. For
instance, a child with one parent,
who spends his most forming
years in a university nursery, and
not with his mother, is not going
to know his mot Iter anything like
as much as a child developing at
home. If the parents have
prepared themselves sufficiently it
should not be necessary for a
mother to take a full-time job, and
preferably not even a part-time
job. while caring for her child.
Surely if children are going to be
brought tip by a method of mass-
production, nursery style, it is
better to delay birth until such
time as parents can do their best
at an exceedingly difficult job.
I am not criticizing the
p e r f o r m a n c e of i n d i v i d u a l
nurseries. I am suggesting that the
large-scale use of them falls far
short of proper motherly care and
attention.
O n the other hand, M i c h a e l
Arthur's Universal First A i d K i t
provided the week before ( F E L I X
X o . 506) is not very commenda-
ble, either. Apart from its lack of
discretion, the advocation of
abortion in terms so shallow
demonstrates a frightening level
of i n s e n s i t i v i t y , p a r t i c u l a r l y
coming from a Welfare Officer.
"Don't worry, there's always
abortion" (not his words) is a
despicable attitude to take
towards the realities of life.
M i c h a e l provides an excellent
service for the students at IC, but I
think he has slipped up here.
The two extreme attitudes to
abortion in the last two editions
must surely have drastically over-
simplified the situation. Abortion
can be used to prevent a
childhood spent in misery and
alienation. It should surely not be
used as an easy solution to a
problem which in so many cases
would never have occurred, had a
little though been applied to the
situation.
Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,
I would like to congratulate
the organisers of Welfare Day on
their 'obvious success' and I hope
it becomes an annual event.
However, it would seem my
enthusiasm for such an event is
not shared by all, especially
M r . Lane (Letters, F E L I X N o
507;. I feel M r . Lane has blown
certain aspects of the day out of all
p r o p o r t i o n . T h e C o n d o m
Inflating contest was probably
never meant to be anything other
than 'really silly', to quote M a r y ,
and provided light relief on an
otherwise serious afternoon.
P e r s o n a l l y , I do not feel
humiliated by my association
with a U n i o n promoting such an
event, indeed I am proud to
belong to a U n i o n with a
balanced outlook on the problems
of young people _
Some of these problems are
of p r i m e i m p o r t a n c e here.
Despite the fact that it appears to
contravene M r . Lane's moral
code, sex is enjoyed by many
students at College. It is therefore
quite reasonable to provide
information on contraception and
an honest account in F E L I X is an
excellent way of doing . this.
Discretion in an article such as
this would be misplaced, as few
people would want to unravel
cryptic clues in order to avoid an
unwanted pregnancy. I also feel it
is useful to discuss these matters
openly on occasions such as
Welfare Day rather than telling
people they should feel guilty
about the whole affair.
M a n y people get a great deal
ol pleasure out of sex as an
i n t e g r a l part of a l o v i n g
relationship (I do not consider
'love' to be a tainted word). Many-
people also enjoy sex on a purely
physical basis, and can afford to if
they have the common sense to
employ our modern under-
standing of contraception. W h y
should people feel guilty about
the physical pleasure of sex when
they would not feel guilty about
the physical pleasure given by
eating food or drinking good
beer?
I would never dispute
anyone's right to religious views
but I would be grateful if such
views were kept to the individual
and not used to judge others.
Yours, depraved, .

Sir, - A couple of points
raised in last weeks F E L I X
cannot , surely, go unanswered.
Godsquad ( I C C U , Chaplaincy,
Methsoc, etc.) seem to have
become too complacent of late so
to kickoff, I for one disagree with
the statement made on the letters
page last week that; "Total
abslinance is a 100% effective method
of contraception" - surely Godsquad
have heard of V i r g i n birth - the
British legal system certainly has,
and recognised at least one case of
it earlier this century. Perhaps g-
s do not believe in such religious
nonsense?
T o go on and suggest that
total abstinance is anything other
than extreme is absurd. Try-
l o o k i n g u p e x t r e m e i n a
dictionary. It could be argued
that castration is more extreme,
but surely that is merely a method
employed to attain abstinance,
and cannot therefore be more
extreme than the end which it
attains. Further suggesting that
"there are no side effects" is to talk on
rather thin ice. Does the author of
last weeks letter have curly hair or
wear glasses? M r . Rider then
proceeds to jump up and down on
the ice by implying that sex causes
guilt. It remains true that many-
people have lost a lot of sleep over
sex (perhaps not at IC?) but I
cannot help thinking that he has
missed the point. A strong sex-
guilt association is possibly a
m i n o r p s y c h i a t r i c p r o b l e m
caused by prolonged abstinance,
thus invalidating the " n o side
effects" claim. Further, I for one,
would feel guilty if indulging in
total abstinance, at the thought of
many girls being deprived of 24-
hour access to my body, which
brings me on to a number of
p o i n t s r a i s e d b y M a r y
(Attenborough)'s letter last week.
Most people at IC realise
that they are wanted for their
minds- by the academic staff if no-
one else, and occasionally, by-
some sections of Life Sciences. T o
realise that they may also be
wanted for their bodies is surely-
reassuring if in moderation-
which is not quite what Mary-
said.
Incidentally, if M r . Lucock
were to hang around Bolton
Gardens late at night, he might
well find himself being treated
purely as a sex object. Finally,
whilst on the subject of the
Liberals, did M a r y really mean
what she said - and I quote (in
c o n t e x t , t o o ) : ''Male only
events....are aimed at re-emphasising a
man's sex role (having a bit offun with
the lads)"? I thought that the
Y M C A catered for that sort of
thing.
Yours sincerely,
K.J.Fenning
Dear Sir, - I feel I must reply to
Ms. Attenborough's letter of
2/2/79. I am, once again,
appalled at the detrement she
causes to women fighting against
sexism by the ill advised words she
uses, .
The dictionary definition of
" S E X I S M " is"any sort of
discrimination on grounds of sex (orig.
against women, now against women
and men)" - chamber's 20th
century dictionary - and I wonder
why she hasn't thought that
positive discrimination might
include encouraging men to
become nurses and secretaries etc.
I am constantly amazed by
the strain fellow women put on
their husbands, brothers etc. by-
expecting them to be a "tower of
strength" to turn to when the
going gets tough and use their sex
as an excuse for being weak and
ineffectual. I feel there is much to
be gained for both sexes by-
removing sexism - women will leel
respected as being of some
intellectual as well as physical
worth and men will not feel it
necessary to act out a role of
aggression, unsuited to most men
I know.
Finally, I must comment on
Ms. Attenborough's apparent
condemnation of marriage. Does
she seriously believe that a
w o m a n is either a quiet,
submissive and domesticated
