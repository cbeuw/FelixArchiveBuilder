FEES CAMPAIGN
IC Union is to stage its biggest campaign for a considerable
n u m b e r of years in a bid to persuade the College not to impose
any tuition fee increases next October and to bring overseas
students' fees down to the home rate.
Tuition fees are expected to go up by about 10 per cent this
year following an announcement by Education Minister
Shirley Williams that fee-levels would keep pace with inflation.
It is estimated that the cost to the College of implementing the
Union demands would be in excess of Â£400,000.
At a meeting on Tuesday this week the U n i o n External Affairs
Committee decided to direct the campaign at three main fronts: the
media and public; the College and Governors; and the students
themselves.
T o gain attention from the national media students are being asked
to participate in a lobby of parliament involving a different M P each
day for a month.
Students would first write to their M P s and arrange to see them at the
House of Commons between 26th February and 23rd M a r c h . Dates
will be coordinated by the IC U n i o n Office and students will only have
to go to the office and inform the U n i o n of their home address. The
U n i o n would then prepare a letter to the student's M P , which the
student would simply have to sign and post.
be a mass lobby of Governing
Another gimmick to attract
media attention will be a "speak-
i n " at Speakers' Corner on
Sunday 25th February. As many
students as possible will speak for
5 to 10 minutes each including
overseas students speaking in
their own languages.
S t u d e n t s w i l l a l s o be
encouraged to write letters and
articles to the provincial press in
favour of overseas students being
able to study in this country.
In addition the U n i o n will
contact former overseas students
now working in their own
countries, and ask them to write
to the Rector telling him how
much they have benefitted from
being educated at IC. Copies of
these letters will be sent to the
press.

These tactics are aimed at
gaining public sympathy for the
Union's demand. T o convince the
College and IC's Governing Body
the U n i o n is to send a letter to all
the Governors outlining its case.
The Rector is to address the
next IC U n i o n Council meeting
on 26th February at which the
main points of the campaign will
be put to him. Finally there will

by as many students as possibe.
The third line of attack is aimed at
increasing students' involvement
and awareness of the problem.

External Affairs Officer Sheyne
Lucock told a F E L I X reporter
that he was optimistic about the
success of the campaign but it will
need a lot of hard work. "The more
people involved in the Lobbies of
Parliament and Governing Body the
greater the chances of success. If wefail
it will be more due to student apathy
than the strength or otherwise of our
case." H e was confident that a lot
of people would want to work for
this campaign.

Committee will contribute by
conducting a survey among IC's
1000 overseas students in order to
find out what degree of financial
hardship would result if fee
increases were to go ahead
The National U n i o n of Students
is not campaigning on this issue
but wishes IC U n i o n the best of
luck.
Next Friday sees the 24 hr
pedal car race at Bristol. The race
starts at 3 p m on the 16th
F e b r u a r y . H o w e v e r t h e
Guilds/IF Valentines party is to
be held in the J C R on the same
night and so Guilds have a smaller
team of supporters. This year,
only 30 are going down to Bristol.
The Mines Bottle match against
Wass, pedal car captains
Cambourne also clashes with the
end of the pedal car race. T h e
Guilds captain, Pete Wright, is
confident that Guilds will w i n and
Mines will come 2nd. There are
over 40 teams in the race. T h e
Mines women have always won
the ladies prize and are confident
of another win this year.
IC M O T I O N A T S R C
Imperial College Union's third motion to the University of
L o n d o n U n i o n this session was accepted without opposition
last week.
The motion, calling for the Senate House L i b r a r y to be open
to the public, was one of four motions to be passed at
Wednesday's meeting of the Students' Representative Council.
The S R C also agreed to hold a one day Alternative Prospectus
conference under the auspices of U L U . This was proposed by the S R C
Executive in accordance with a decision taken at its last meeting. The
conference's aim would be to encourage colleges of the University to
produce their own Alternative Prospectuses which could be printed in
Spring 1980 and be available for the prospective 1981 student entry.
The conference may also investigate a joint L o n d o n University
Alternative Prospectus.
Imperial is at present the only college in L o n d o n University
producing an Alternative Prospectus. T h e S R C Executive is to liaise
with I C U in organising the conference.
Another motion passed at the S R C meeting called for L o n d o n
colleges not to timetable any courses on Wednesday; afternoons so that
this period could be set aside for sport.
The S R C also resolved to support East European dissidents and
encourage college unions to do likewise.
