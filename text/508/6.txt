The papers have already gone up for the elections of the
departmental representatives. Election to the post is by a paper ballot
M o n d a y 26th Feb. in each department.
Recently a job description was drawn up so to give each candidate an
idea of what the post entails. This is printed in full below. In addition to
reading this, it is an extremely good idea to speak to the present holder
of the post. Following this, if you wish to have any more points answered
eome up to the Union Office any lunchtime and see me. Alter all, I
have probably had more conversations with Dep reps this year than any
one else.
1. A departmental representative primarily exists to represent the views
of the student members of the department.
2. To ensure democratic elections of Academic and Social Reps,
following A A C recommendation, for each year in the Department and
to liaise .vith Postgraduate Affairs Officer over election of postgraduate
departmental rep.
3. To take an interest in all areas of concern to students in the
department, most particularly those concerning the academic, social
and tutoring arrangements for that department and to co-ordinate the
writing; of the department's Alternative Prospectus entry.
4. T o co-ordinate the academic and social representatives holding
regular open meetings, publicised whenever possible, with both groups
in order to better understand the academic problems and social needs of
the department.
5. To organise the student side of'the staff student committee. To ensure
that all problems relevant to that committee are discussed thereon. To
take matters not necessarily the concern of the staff student committee
up directly with whatever other person or body may be concerned. To
make certain minutes are posted within the department and one S S C is
held a term.
6. T o attempt to ensure proper study facilities and social facilities in the
department.
7. To attempt to stimulate interest in the department in all academic
and social matters and questions of a wider educational matter.
8. To sit on I C U Council, taking an interest in all areas of concern to the
Union and students at Imperial and may, as a Council member, sit on
various committees to represent I C U .
9. To communicate campaigns, policies and elections of I C U and the
respective C C U to departmental members.
10. T o sit on the Academic Affairs committees of I C U and their C C U .
To sit on General committees of their respective C C U .
To sit on Engineering Board if representing a Guilds department.
Should attend U n i o n General meetings.
11. To take an active part in the introduction of students to I.C. and
their department.
12. To take an active part in the interviewing system of prospective
students.
The job is very time consuming, particularly in the first term. It
furthermore needs a lot of dedication and personal effort. If you stand
for the job make sure you firstly know what the job entails, and secondly
that you have enough interest to carry it all out. It is an open-ended
task, a job of infinite scope, which brings little reward.
For the students within a department a bad departmental
representative leads to a demise of staff-student relations,
representation at a higher U n i o n level, and participation in social
events.
Carried out to the best of one's ability it does lead to a lot of personal
satisfaction. Sitting on all the committees also gives you a good insight
into the nature of the U n i o n . So this is the job for any current first years
wanting to actively participate in the running ol the U n i o n .

As a married woman
mysell I find this hard to accept as
I fully intend to pursue my career
and frequently use my non-sexist
marriage as a basis for arguments
against sexism.
Whilst agreeing with many
of'the issues raised by W i S T I feel
I cannot whole-heartedly support
them until they adopt an attitude
more representative of women at
this college.
Yours faithfully.

Dear Sir,
A f t e r h a v i n g p a s s i v e l y
o b s e r v e d the e x c h a n g e of
correspondence about the latest
edition of ' F O R W A R D ' , I wish,
as a member of I.C.Liberal C l u b
and an ex-oflicer ol I.C.Radio to
point out a few facts which I feel
speak for themselves.
1) Last term I received
f r e q u e n t c i r c u l a r s f r o m
I.C. Liberal C l u b committee
members about numerous events
and meetings throughout the
term.
2) O n e of these events was an
editorial meeting ol ' F O R -
W A R D ' which 1 attended.
3) As a result of that meeting.
I wrote the front page article for
the edition of ' F O R W A R D '
produced in the second half of last
term.
4) I received no communica-
tion from Liberal C l u b that a
further edition of ' F O R W A R D '
was planned or to inform me of
any meeting at which the
criticisms contained in it could
have been discussed.
5) Unlike other editions, I
have not vet received a copy of
' F O R W A R D ' t h r o u g h the
internal mail.
6) I have not yet received any
communication from I.C.Liberal
C l u b this term.

Dear Sir,
I am writing with reference
to the article 'Jobs in South
Africa?' , which appeared in last
week' F T L I X . I would like to
correct some of the statements
made in this article (with
reference to the letter sent by the
Academic Affairs Committee):
1) The chances of 'anyone
accepting work in South Africa ...
strengthening the apartheid system' are
pretty remote, chiefly due to the
fact that British citizens are not
initially entitled to vote until they
choose to become South African
citizens (obviously), so at this
stage they would have absolutely
no effect on the apartheid system.
Furthermore, as apartheid is an
Afrikaner-instigated system, the
presence of English speaking
whites would lend to weaken
rather than strengthen this
system. (Afrikaners - descendants
of the 1820 Dutch Settlers.)
2) O n l y South African
citizens are legally hound in any
way to serve in the army - I lived
in South Africa for 11 years as a
British subject and never got as far
as touching an army uniform.
If the statement 'IC I 'nion
policy calls for an immediate end to
recruiting in College for jobs in South
Africa' is followed through,
employment for graduates from
the Royal School of Mines will
be unnecessarily more difficult.
After all, wc are all supposed
to be intelligent university
students, and thus should be able
to decide lor ourselves where wc
would like to work. Of course, a
bit of constructive criticism
always helps, but facts should
never be confused with media-
generated o p i n i o n s , as has
happened here.
Yours sincerely,
S t u T h o m s o n ,

Dear Sir,
I was disgusted with the
article on the British A r m y and
Ireland in F ' E L I X last week. The
main aim of it seems to have been
to propagate the blatant lie that
Northern Ireland is being forced
to remain in the U K against the
will of its people. In fact, the
people of Northern Ireland have
repeatedly made it clear, in every
general election and referendum
since 1918, that the over-
whelming majority wish to stay
within the U K .
The anonymous author (why
anonymous?) says 'the British
G o v e r n m e n t ... p a r t i t i o n e d
Ireland' but conveniently (and
dishonestly) ignores the fact that
the Bill as originally introduced
intended to give independance to
the whole of Ireland. Separation
followed only because of intense
pressure form the people of Ulster
who did not want to be part of an
independant Ireland. In spite of
this, the article claims 'fifteen
thousand troops continue to hold
this artificially formed country for
Britain' as if its people were
desperate to join the Republic.
The author then spends some
time criticising the emergency
powers in use. Certainly, I don't
think they are desirable, and I
don't know of any M P that thinks
them desirable - it is the thugs of
the I.R.A. who have made them
necessary. Obviously the author
has not had his sister beaten up for
chatting to a soldier, or his father
murdered for no greater crime
than being a Protestant. There
have been occasional abuses,
agreed, but I challenge the author
to name half-a-dozen other
countries in the world where the
government and army have gone
so far out of their way to be fair to
terrorists.
I would like to quote A d a m
H a l l : 'the political terrorist is the
person who could create a new
and better world, if he could
e x p r e s s his d r e a m s w i t h
intelligence, but having none, he
can only express his frustrations'.
I rather think the same could
be said for our anonymous
author.
