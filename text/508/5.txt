Landlords and slot meters
One of the best known dodges used by landlords to part you from a
higher proportion of your grant than they otherwise might do is to fiddle
the calibration on your electricity meter so you get less electricity than
you should for your money.
Fortunately there are provisions to counter this dastardly behaviour,
although an attempt to use them to your advantage might conceivably
provoke a breakdown in your, hitherto, undoubtedly friendly relations
with your landlord!
The position would appear to be as follows: The most that a landlord
can charge you on resale of electricity is 3.2 pence per unit plus an
availability charge (like a standing charge) of 3.3 pence per day which
can't be levied through the meter (unless you are given a periodic
statement capable of making any necessary adjustment).
One unit of electricity is equivalent to one Kilowatt hour so you can
work out whether your meter is registering the correct number of units
from the ratings on any appliances that you use and then work out
whether you are being overcharged.
If your check shows that you are being overcharged, you should
approach your landlord in the first instance. If he is not prepared to do
anything about it, you can apply to the County Court under s29 of the
Electricity Act 1957 for an order requiring your landlord to repay any
excess. It would probably be a good idea to get an electricians report on
the behaviour of your meter before going to court.
Squatting
Despite the fuss kicked up by the Campaign Against The Criminal
Tresspass Law, squatting is no less of a viable proposition than it was
before the 1977 Criminal Law Act, although a degree more caution is
required in certain respects than used to be the case.
If you are despairing of the possibility of ever being decently housed
at a rent that you can afford, this is something thatyou might liketo bear
in mind as a realistic alternative to your present arrangements. It is not
really a question of usurping other peoples property rights, since there
is nothing to stop them taking advantage of the appropriate legal
machinery if they feel so inclined. It is simply a means of using
abandoned property which would otherwise remain empty and be of no
use to anyone.
During Welfare Day, Piers Corbyn (ex - president of I.C.U., now
working with Squatters Union), started a list of people who would be

There'll be no references to sex of any description or form i n this
week's Epistle Honest.
Right, now that's over onto the exciting stuff.
Dep Rep Elections
Well the papers for these posts have been up since M o n d a y and I'm
just going to urge you to stand if you think you can and want to do the
job. Remember it's a very important post. If you're i n Management
Science, particularly think about standing as there hasn't been one
before and as most students are on a one year M.Sc. course, candidates
may be a bit thin on the ground.
Sabbatical papers go up on Monday 19th February
Sport Insurance
Not many people seem to be aware that college has an insurance
policy that covers all students against personal injury if they are playing
sport for a college team - i.e. medical expenses and compensation if you
are dehabilitated except if your teeth are damaged. So if you break a
leg, or similar, during a college sporting activity (this includes
Mountaineering, Karate and other 'dangerous' sports) you can claim
compensation.
U G M
Don't forget it on Tuesday 13th February at 1 p m in the Great
Hall . Motions to be discussed include ones on Northern Island and
legalisation of Cannabis, so it's all good strong stuff; and I'll miss you
terribly if you don't come.
