K i l l the huge
eaters
Just think:every time you put y o u r r e c o r d player
on; every three minutes y o u listen to B o n e y - M
records or H o t Chocolate or Sweet; every minute of
every hour you artfue with your friend over why the
Sex Pistols gave up the record business; a m a n oi
your o w n kind - a m a n with the same colour blood
as y o u - stops breathing and d v i n g in Nicaragua, in
V i e t n a m , in Africa, in Iran, in ...? Just to make you
see that your brother i n A f r i c a i n (so called by
Imperalists) T h i r d W o r l d Countries, is suffering;
just to make you understand that a part of that L P
you r u n your discos on is made to the price of his
blood; just to make you see that with every new
single y o u buy a gun is bought to make his kind
shut u p because you a n d yours want to listen to
S a n t a n a !
His blood is writing something on the ground
where he is dving; look closer, you will see it. yes it is
saving: you send rockets to the moon - you produce
test-tube babies - you brought sour fantasies into
real life- made impossible possible while the only
fantasy your brother in Africa has is for you to
come out of fantasy - to stop looking at the stars; to
start looking on the earth, on the ground, to see
that his fantasy is to find something to eat. to bring
back h u m a n rights from papers to real life, into
action. H i s mother does not want a new cooker, she
is only too pleased with a small hut under peaceful
circumstances. H i s mother's fantasy is to see h i m
back tor lunch, to make sure that he will come back
alive to sleep on his coat or a broken rug. She know>
that her son a n d herself like millions of other
Africans or other influenced peoples are the tool>
and workers of Imperialist comfort a n d mone\
m a k i n g machines. She knows that they are
suffering because thev have the tools. the\ have the
mines, thev have the oil wells, they have the
p r i m a r y substances, a n d have the m a i n object-
which are all eye-catching for the Western a n d
Eastern investors. She knows that thev have the
right censured by Western a n d some C o m m u n i s t
countries tradition a n d culture which is most
convenient for the western money eaters - money
grab tiers - the b i s Western a n d Russian businesses.
She knows that even- dav that they tjo to their
bank to a d d some more monev to their accounts,
some more people are killed - some more guns are
sold'
Iranian people now know that every day Shah
puts some money in his Swiss bank, a n d recently
A m e r i c a n banks, some more guns tanks a n d
artillery devices are bought, more do-it-yourself
pieces of cars etc. made by western workers (the
main P r i m a r y substances of which are extracted
from the ores in the mines of Iran), a useless
industry (the steel industry, for example) is set up in
countries like Iran with fascist rulers. A n d this is
called I N D U S T R I A L I S A T I O N ^ ! ? ? ) Iranian
people know that the content of their religion has
been hidden from them for years a n d only the
container has been left a n d they n o w want to get
the content back, their wealth back their country
back. T h e y have been called superstitious fanatics
for years. T h e children of very rich investors in Iran
have for years been trained to take the Western
way of life to o u r deeprooted Islamic culture. A s a
present to get our people involved w i t h the toys of
this enemy, a n d to buy more of these toys because
there was nothing left of the content o f their
culture, which they had been made to forget. They
had been made frightened of it a n d the people who
tried to get back the content to the container had
been imprisoned (e.g. D r . Shariaty).
But who cares? T h e y o u n g generation in
England a n d A m e r i c a is too busy following the
pop-stars wherever they go. It is too busy helping
people with their problems through Scientology
than to help them to c o m m u n i c a t e better. Instead
of using their ability for constructive purposes to
save a person's life, they prefer to use it for personal
and selfish means.
Let alone the more mature generation such as
the Owens w h o are "honest1
' m e n and who are just
doing their jobs to save the long sleeping young
generation of E n g l a n d from a big crisis which
would endanger them with a shortage of oil or a
reduction in the sales of do-it-yourself bits and
pieces.
Fortunately the C I A was asleep in that
early m o r n i n g when o u r people woke u p a n d lit
their candles to search for the content of their
religion. Before the Americans had even realized it.
our people h a d found the content a n d following
E m m a n K o m a n i (their religious leader) and
protested. H a n d s a n d voices were roused to get
their lover back, to get the words of A l l a h back to
their society from dusty bookshelves where it had
been left untouched for m a n y years. T h e i r love and
their shouts a n d protests at once awakened the
heavy sleeping C a r t e r a n d orders started to come
from A m e r i c a bv means ofsatellites (made from the
k i l l i n g of thousands o f people) to the Shah. T h e
consequences?.... martial law. Black Friday.
But we are not frightened of tanks and guns. W e
are lovers a n d love is something abstract a n d this
love give us enough willpower to carry on fighting,
ignoring the guns a n d tanks. This willpower is
growing ever more in the hearts of our people a n d
will not stop breathing unlit it has killed, until it
has cut a l l the ties - until we are free. W e will fight
until we get what we want. W h a t we want is an

W'e are n o w about to close the doors of this guest
house which has for m a n y years been entertaining
people o f West, East a n d N o r t h , we want to kick
out both the servant a n d the guests far out to their
own (about to be destroyed) nations and lands. So
would you m i n d taking your foot off the door

If estimates are correct that 10% of the
population are gay (i.e. predominently
attracted to people of the same sex), then
there should be about 500 gays at I.C. Sadly,
not a l l of y o u are m e m b e r s of
not all of you are members of I.C. G A Y S O C .
W h y ? Because of the insults and ridicle of
your fellow students at I.C. unable to come to
terms with a part of themselves which they
are afraid to admit exists.
I have realised that being gay is often
associated with being promiscuous a n d that
this promiscuity is thought to be impersonal,
selfish and unemotional. In my opinion and
experience this is a blatant fantasy spread
about to discredit gay relationships. Some
gays, but by no means all, have more than
one emotional and sexual relationship, w h i c h
I believe is good provided the people involved
grow from the relationships. Surely what we
should be fighting is not promiscuity or
homosexuality but L U S T or equivalently
S f i X I S M i.e. treating people purely as sex
objects not h u m a n beings: such relationships
are impersonal, selfish a n d unemotional and
c a n o c c u r i n m o n o g a m o u s a n d / o r
heterosexual equally well as in promiscuous
and/or homosexual relationships.
I would be very happy to discuss with
anyone or any group any relevant matters.
F o r the m a n y gay students at I C reading this,
please s e r i o u s l y c o n s i d e r j o i n i n g I C
G A Y S O C (contact me in r o o m 533, Huxley
Building or phone int. tel. 4297) or
alternatively come along to a U . L . U .

8.00 p . m . in the U . L . U . b u i l d i n g M A L E T
street (nearest tube: Goodge Street). The
meetings are usually held in room 2 F on the
second floor (though there is a large notice
board in the entrance hall giving the meeting
room for each society). T h e meetings
comprise a speaker followed by discussion,
and everyone is welcome - gay, bi or straight.
If vou feel insufficiently confident to do that
try ringing I C E B R E A K E R S , a gay
councelling organisation which will talk over
personal problems of gays, bisexuals a n d
people uncertain. and will subsequently
introduce you, if you wish, at meetings to
other people in the same position.
I C E B R E A K E R S : 0 1 - 2 7 4 - 9 5 9 0
T h e important thing to remember is that
being bisexual or gay is not the end of the
world, it's the start of a new world.
