NEWS IN BRIEF
B O A R D O F S T U D I E S
At a meeting of the Board of
Studies on Wednesday a note on
information at schools about I C
courses presented by Imperial
College U n i o n was accepted and
referred to the Admissions Policy
Committee for further investiga-
tion.
The note suggested that the
poor level of information at school
level regarding university courses
was a factor leading to high
failure rates in some departments.
Various proposals for improving
communication with schools were
made.
Student numbers for this year
were made available to the Board
of Studies. T h e College has been
told by the University Grants
C o m m i t t e e that first year
undergraduate enrolment must
not exceed 1100. T h e Rector told
the Board that he would not like
to see less than this number as the
College would suffer a drop in
income from tuition fees. This
year 1101 first year undergrad-
uates entered College.
H A M L E T G A R D E N S
A Tenants" Association for
residents of Hamlet Gardens flats
is to be set up on the initiative of
Imperial College U n i o n .
L ' n i o n P r e s i d e n t M a r y
Attenborough has called a
meeting for next Friday evening
at Hammersmith T o w n H a l l to
discuss any problems that tenants
may want to raise and to set up an
Association to assist in dealings
with the landlord.
The meeting is for residents
C R O S S W O R D !
other than those in the College
flats. M a n y of them are also I C
students and are licensees of
L o n d o n Property Services. N o n -
student tenants of H a m l e t
Gardens have also been invited.
A t a meeting of L.P.S. tenants
held in College on 30th January-
students felt that they wanted to
get together to be in a stronger
position to deal with the landlord
as it is rumoured that L.P.S. have
used unscrupulous tactics towards
tenants in the past.
The need arises out of a recent
Court of Appeal decision which
means that L.P.S. tenants may
have security of tenure a n d the
right to apply to the Rent Officer
for the registration of a fair rent.
G U I L D S ' M O T I O N
N e x t T h u r s d a y , 1 5 t h
February, a very important topic
will be discussed at the Guilds
U n i o n M e e t i n g . N a m e l y ,
whether or not motions of a
political or contraversial nature
that could be dealt with at I C
U G M s should be submitted and
discussed at C & G U G M s .
Several Guildsmen believe that
U n i o n Meetings are too frivolous
and should involve serious topics
while others are satisfied with the
present format. T h e discussions,
on Thursday, could change all
future Guilds U n i o n Meetings
and even Guilds U n i o n itself.

At the S R C meeting the U L U Deputy President requested
suggestions from students on the contents of next year's L o n d o n
Student Handbook. I C students who wish to make their views known
should contact U L U Representative Barry Austin v i a the Physics 2
letter rack.
After much heated debate an emergency motion was passed
condemning Westfield College Students' U n i o n for its recent ban on
the Socialist Workers' Party. The decision to outlaw the S W P was made
after a motion claiming that the party was 'disruptive', 'hypocritical'
and 'violent' was passed by an eight vote majority at a Westfield union
meeting in January.

Market and O p i n i o n Research
International has asked I C U n i o n
for permission to carry out a
survey in College of the attitudes
of final year undergraduates
towards careers.
The survey which is on behalf
of various government agencies
and independent companies has
been carried out in the College in
previous years.
In 1976, 18 universities were
included in the survey. In that
year only male students were
questioned, but this year men and
women will be included.

The College Registrar has
agreed to waive fees for the seven
students affected by the recent
new ruling on the ordinary
residence qualification, after
being given the go-ahead by the
Deans' Committee.
The seven students suddenly-
found themselves last October
without a grant and having to pay
tuition fees as they were no longer
classed as ordinarily resident i n
this country as described in the
grant regulations.
IC U n i o n Executive has asked
Welfare Adviser M i c h a e l A r t h u r
to look into the possibility of
setting up the students as a charity
so that money could be raised to
help pay for their lving costs.
D W I L E F L O N K
The R o y a l Holloway College
Students' U n i o n Society in
E g h a m has invited Colleges to
enter teams for the "University of
L o n d o n Dwyle Flonk Challenge
C u p " .
Their letter to I C U n i o n
describes Dwyle Flonk as a
"traditional Surrey sport analogous to
cricket". But the analogy seems to
be limited to the fact that one
team bats and the other fields, for
the rules go on to say that "the
fielding team holds hands, forms a
circle and hops clockwise".
Entries to the competition to be
held on 2nd M a r c h are to be sent
by 17th February. Details are
available from M a r y Attenbo-
rough i n the U n i o n Office.
