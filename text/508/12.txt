APPEAL
Imagine yourself a normal, intelligent
person, but totally unable to communicate
with the outside world. Even if you became
deaf tomorrow, you would retain the whole
knowledge, experience and vocabulary
which are part of a personality built up by
hearing. A deaf child starts with nothing but
his eyes, he has to learn that soundless
shapes on faces have a meaning. He cannot
ask the questions that free his normally
curious mind. However most children are not
totally deaf and with understanding, hard
work and the latest technical aids, they can
achieve oralism and happily integrated with
the hearing world.
11 year old Jerome Canvin is such a child.
He attends a normal primary school with a
unit for children with defective hearing
attached. Along with the other 12 children, at
school he can use a new piece of equipment
known as the 'Phonic Ear', which uses a
radio-link, capable of communication with
the teacher for up to half a mile, and cutting
out much of the background noise which
makes listening in a classroom very difficult
with normal aids. But as it costs 800 pounds
only four of them have this equipment at
home, so at 3 30 every day they must leave
their 'bionic ears' (as they call them) behind
and return to a silent world.
R C S are to hold a special collection to buy
Jerome the aid, which "would be an
incredible advantage to him at a time when he
really needs one, and enable him to do a lot he
cannot at the moment, including help him to
talk properly which is still a problem although
he is 11" - in the words of his brother Mark, a
student in Life Sciences. It will be done
through the Devon branch of the National
Deaf Children's Society, the Secretary of
which said "We would be delighted to accept
a cheque on Jerome's behalf ... it is a
wonderful piece of equipment which is
opening up a new world to the severely deaf."
The collection is to be held onSaturday
17th Feb and will be organised on a Year
Collections' basis, as Jerome's parents have
donated a barrel (for the winning year) and
prizes for the top three collectors, so do come
out and support your year. Anyone from
Guilds, Mines or IF is also very welcome.
(Your money will be included in your C C U ' s
total) Cans will be available from R C S U from
9.00 am and throughout the day, so please
come along, if only for half an hour and help
give a new lease of life to a silent child.
Thank you,
Rachel Snee

<g one of the school's
PS. If anyone wants more information, I can
give them some leaflets from the N D C S (from
which I got much of the material tor this
article.)
Last Thursday (Ist.) the few members of the
Community Action Group that came to the
meeting in the SCR were treated to a very
interesting talk by John Rodgers, C o -
ordinator of the New Horizon Youth Project,
an establishment that works for the homeless
young people in London, especially around
the West End.
This talk and the ensuing discussion
brought those of us who were present a new
understanding of the problems faced by
young people today who leave school with
little prospect of employment. Their own
frustrations, coupled with the hassle of
always being around quite often lead to
untenable home relationships and the youth
(usually male but a not insignificant number
of women also end up coming to London)
decides to leave home and search for his
fortune in one of the cities, usually London
but increasingly more, some of the others,
Leeds for instance. Many actually find work in
the West-End catering trade but the wages
are so notoriously low that they have no
chance of accumulating the deposit to enter
into the accommodation market. These
people therefore end up in hostels which are
essentially nothing but beds for the night and
in no way could be considered home, so
during the day they end up wandering the
streets. These are the people that New
Horizon was established to help and the
number of individuals that they saw last year
exceeded 1000 with many making more than
one attendance.
New Horizon forms a kind of base for
these young people in that it offers a store for
their few possessions or somewhere to get a
shave and a wash. It also offers help in legal
matters, social security and many other
things including basic literacy.
The Centre maintains a workshop that they
use to give some very minimal training but as
a certain degree of literacy is required to gain
admittance to a government training scheme
this is what they concentrate on.
On Sundays they use two or three
volunteers, rmainly from other university
colleges who work with the visitors in an
informal way aiming to bring out their artistic
and creative abilities using the many facilities
available.
Anyway, if you are interested in the work of
New Horizon or any of the other similar
organizations in London then please get in
touch.
Cheers, John Whitehouse
