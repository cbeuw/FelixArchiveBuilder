Lectures by the seaside!
did you know IC U n i o n owns five Ford Transits and a
Landrover? Although these are well used by clubs o n
Wednesdays and at weekends they are usually available during
the rest of the week.
Lectures by the seaside have the following advantages:
1) stimulating atmosphere
2) choice of distractions other than F E L I X
3) genuine Pythagorean "blackboard"
4) ready made ripple tank
Beat the s u m m e r rush and book a Transit now!!!
