Firsts draw with LSE
I C 1st X I 1 v . 1 L S E 31st J a n .
This was I C first competitive game this season owing to
the combination o f rain, snow, frost and A r t h u r which had so
far prevented play. Concern was expressed by some players
about their ability to survive the runout to the pitch and pre-
match w a r m up without suffering f r o m c r a m p , pulled
muscles, or other more serious ailments.
IC were under pressure throughout most of the first half and failed
to string more than one or two passes together. The college team were
relying on breakaways to make use of the speed of Brindle, R i c k a r d and
Stephenson up front, and they were unlucky not to score when both
Rutty and Paver went close with headers. However, L S E ' s pressure
eventually told and they scored after a quickly taken free-kick on the
left. I n the second half, the i C team played with more authority
although they still did not show the tbrm of last term. After about
twenty minutes, IC equalised through Brindle, who ran on to a Rickard
pass before easily beating the keeper. After this, IC could (should?) have
scored three or four more goals but with a cold bottom four inches this
proved beyond them, and the game finished a 1 - 1 draw.
Team: Tsoukkas, Rutty, Reeve, Paver, Kendrick, Haralampous, Johnson,
Davies, Rickard, Brindle, Stevenson.

This game saw IC gain
another two league points,
though like their last game against
LSE the team again did not play
well.
The game was very scrappy

Rickard but failed to assert their
authority o n the game. Regular
g o a l k e e p e r T o n y T s o u k k a s
arrived late during the first-half
his place having already been ably
taken by Steve Veats. T h e real
reason for Tsoukkas' interest in
the game was however discovered
later when he decided that in spite
of his inactivity he still needed a
shower and the chance to cavort
with centre-back Reeve. The
second-half was much like the
first and IC went 2-0 up when the
ball hit the end of Peter Rutty's
boot before finding the back of the
net. R F H pulled a goal back but IC
went close with shots by Johnson
and Nicholls before increasing
their lead through Phil Brindle. So
a fairly comfortable 3-1 win, but

Last Sunday, Falmouth hall
beat Keogh by 8-2. The match,
played at Harlington, was full of
entertaining football. Harry Sing
scored a sensational hat trick. H e
scored his last goal by picking the
ball up in defence and ran all the
way down the wing, cut inside,
swerved p a s s e d t h e K e o g h
defence and after a quick one-two
at the edge of the box slammed
the ball past the goalkeeper.
This result takes Falmouth
hall to the top of the league with 4
pts from 4 games.

L . S . E . 2 n d X I 1IC 2 n d X I 2
(3rd instalment of IC 2nd's cup run)
This was the much awaited,
weather delayed replay of the
U L U reserves cup quarter final.
A l l I C players were safely tucked
up in bed with cups of Horlicks by
9.30pm the previous night on
strict instructions from Clive
Whiteside. I C ' s hopes were
brightened by the prospect that
I C 1st X I were playing L S E 1st
X I at the same time and so no new
'stars' would spring up from
nowhere.
I C began t h e first h a l f
defending as usual a n d our
attacks consisting of kicking the
ball into L S E ' s half and hoping
this p r e s s u r e w o u l d cause
unforced errors. L S E opened the
score sheet, their player collecting
the ball near the halfway line and
with I C players trying their best
to avoid h i m he proceeded to
power the ball under a diving A l
Betts. Despite this setback I C
continued to fight on and Barnet,
Hatton and Price kept the L S E
forwards under control with the
usual 'pleasant' encouraging
shouts from Chris Beer. However
IC's attacking policies were not
working, which could be due to
Phil Niccolls having argued with
his girlfriend, and L S E hung on to
their lead up to half time.
After the usual aggressive talk
(pure aggression, no actual
football tactics) at half time, I C
started to play more construct-
ively with Phil Niccolls chopping
down L S E ' s centre-forward and
Neil Price holding onto the little
Welsh winger's shirt for a
'friendly' five seconds. I C ' s first
proper attack of the game was
started by Alistair Lencener
shooting down the right wing and
producing a perfect cross for Dave
Higgs to convert into a goal. This
triggered off IC's best play with
s o m e g o o d m o v e s b e i n g
developed by A d r i a n Clarke and
Paul Barnet working together on
the right flank. 5 minutes later,
John Demnitz decided to justify
his selection by collecting the ball
on the edge of the penalty area,
beating two defenders a n d the
goalkeeper to score what the
referee descibed as 'the best goaf
he'd seen for a long time (he
obviously hadn't refereed for a
long time).
IC now had most of the play
but could create no more scoring
chances and L S E were ruthlessly
robbed of the ball by the staunch
back four a n d 'impossible' Phil
Niccolls, whenever they ventured
near our penalty area.
T h e team were allowed a quick
celebratory orange slice before
being taken home and tucked up
in bed with more Horlicks by
Clive Whiteside i n preparation
for Saturday, 10th February
when they play Q M C IPs in the
cup semi-final match o f the year.
