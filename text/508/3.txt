If this week's F E L I X comes out (publication date uncertain at
the time of writing) then it will be mostly set on the new
typesetter. There were some teething troubles at first but it's
working again now!
M o r e F E L I C E S
After numerous requests for more F E L I C E S to be left in
departments I decided to increase the print run to 4000. This
means that there will be about 50 to a hundred extra copies per
department, depending on its size. If all these are taken then the
print run will stay at 4000.
M o r e S t a f f
Since printing this extravaganza now takes about half an hour
longer per run than it did before, a lot of paste -ups have to be
ready by Wednesday. This means that more stafl are needed to
help on Tuesday afternoons and evenings. Those of you lucky
enough to volunteer will have the added delight of the Brovid
Maker and Typesetter to play with, as if headlining wasn't
enough fun.
Collating, of course, takes longer now and starts around 7.00
p m o n T h u r s d a y s i n the F E L I X O f f i c e .
P h o e n i x
The cultural magazine of IC now has an Editor, " E r i c "
Jarvis. A n y stories, poems or photos of an "artistic" nature
would be most welcome. If you would like to contribute to
Phoenix, then drop your copy into the envelope in the F E L I X
Office. Essays or features that are too long for F E L I X (1000
words plus) will also be gratefully accepted.
R C M C a n t e e n
Once in a while the number of IC students using the R C M
Canteen grows to the point of overcrowding. At the moment we
are still welcome but only after 1.30 p.m. Please try and stay out
until then otherwise we will be banned altogether.
U G M
There is a U G M on T u e s d a y 13th at 1 p m i n the G r e a t
H a l l . Motions on the agenda include the Legalisation of
Cannabis and Housing. There is no motion on Iran so you've no
excuse for not turning up! Cheers

NOT JUST FOR KICKS
In College men outnumber women by about eight to one but the
women 'a problems do not end there.
Only Beit, Falmouth and Selkirk have places for women in halls. The
rest are acommodated in digs or flats out in the wilds of Hammersmith
or Earls Court etc. and must frequently face a walk home alone from a
tube station or bus stop after an evening at IC.
I am reminded of Trevor Phillip's remark that all colleges should run a
women's self defence class. It would, under the circumstances, seem no
more than normal prudence to do so.
This new venture organised by Merche Clark and Sue Owen deserves
support for the women and encouragement from the men.
The Group has been meeting in the Union Building for a few weeks
now. They have not been able to secure a regular room but can usually
be found in the Gym. The instructor is qualified and requires £10 per
week for her services.
This money has to be found from somewhere.
Initial low attendance resulted in fees of £1 so the group decided to
appeal to ICWA for assistance. The Association was notconvincedthat
the idea would be successful but granted 21 green ones to help reduce
the cost.
Last Thursday the organisers held a Jumble Sale, raising 50 pounds
(of which £25 went to the Creche). I would like to see the Group thrive
and ICWA invest more money to subsidise the cost.
The numbers have been, on the face of it, disappointing.
I think many women believe the Group to be too reactionary - a get-
together of political Amazons. Yet I know many girls are frightened of
London, particularly after dark.
Although those attending are taught how to punch, whereto kick and
other movements, a lot of emphasis is put on repelling fear. It seems
plenty of background work has been done concerning attacks on
women; to sort out why they happen and the best ways to prevent their
occurrence.
Girls that scare easily are more prone to attack and, believe it or not
the assaulters are easily discouraged if stood up to.
The whole idea of the class is to give them this self-confidence.
Don't worry fellas. They have promised not to declare martial law in
the archaic corridors of IC. and ladies : make an effort to attend. The
next meeting will be in the G y m at 7.30 p m on Monday.
I can well imagine that it's fun and a great social occasion and I bet
that it breeds a number of stiff students for Tuesday mornings!
I'm quite familiar with such events though, having had them at school
They are enjoyable if you take the trouble to get involved but students
tend to feel tremendously overworked; too busy to bother, when such
pains as lab-reports, projects and problem sheets, only lead to the
distress of examinations. A n y minor disturbance to the strict routine is
dreaded like the plague.
It's a shame that so much organization achieves so little, gaining such
low levels of respect. I wonder if it's worthwhile.
Take Care,
John Shuttleworth

Another Contact Week has been and gone. The only contact I had was
the supplement in FELIX. I'm not complaining but I am surprised.
