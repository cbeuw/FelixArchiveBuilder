M E T E O R O L O G I C A L AND
ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIETY
In the past years, the society arranged some very good lectures on all
aspects of atmospheric phenomena and its impact on the environment.
This year is no exception.
The last lecture was given by Dr. Peter Moore of King's College,
London on the "Biological Evidence of Past Climate". With the help of
excellent slides, he described the intricate detective work to solve the
difficult question of what the past climate is like. He justified the use of
pollen as an indicator, since a particular type of plant only flourishes
under certain conditions. Hundreds of holes were drilled all over Britain,
and the number of pollens in the sample was literally counted under a
microscope. After much work, a picture of past climate in Britain
emerged. He stressed that there were still unsolved problems
introduced by human activites.
The lecture was well attended, a lively discussion carried on afterward
over coffee and biscuits.
The next :ecture is on 12th Feb, given by Professor W.T. Welford of
Physics Department on "the Use of Space Age Optics to Capture Solar
Energy" . It starts at 5.30 pm in Lecture theatre Room 719 In the New
Huxley Building.
A summary of this term's program is as follows:
19th Feb. Film on (1) Nuclear disposal in the Irish Sea (2) Nuclear war
threat
26th Feb. Prof. J . Latham (U.M.I.ST.) on "Thunder and Lightning"

departmental representatives.
Each department elects one
person to represent the students'
views towards the department and
the rest of the student body.
Generally known as dep. reps,
they also sit on IC Union Council.
Dep reps are usually under-
graduates, however they are
supposed to represent both
undergraduates and postgrad-
uates. P G s can stand for election
and are encouraged at least to
take part in the voting.
N o m i n a t i o n p a p e r s h a v e

T h e M a n a g e m e n t S c i e n c e

for the first time next session.
Since there are no undergrad-

any P G who is likely to continue
here after O c t o b e r p l e a s e

P G TIPS
Here it is, what you've all been
waiting for, the one and only great
postgraduate bar night. This
amazing event is brought to you
for your delight and enjoyment on
Tuesday 20th February (Stan.
M o o n e y , B o o k i n g s O f f i c e
weather, t h e T U C , etc. permitting)
in Stan's real ale bar, Southside
from 6.30 to 11.00 pm. You can'!
possibly miss this number one
occasion in the social calendar, so
make a note in your diary now.
Just in case you need a further
incentive there will be a 10p per
pint subsidy on beer (pro rata on
other beverages).
So switch off your apparatus,
lay down your books, lock up the
laboratory and come along and
meet IC's other 1,499 PGs. Your
life may never be the same again.
On a more mundane note: IC
Union election time is here again
LONDON STUDENT TRAVEL
Avid readers of " F O R W A R D ! " and some others will know of
the existence of this company and that Imperial College Union
has a sizeable shareholding in it. Since this shareholding was
bought with what is, effectively, your money, you (that is, every
I.C. student) are entitled to know what is going on in the
Company.
Well, lor a start there has been a new manager appointed recently.
Roger Trask, will actually take up his post at the beginning of M a r c h ,
his predecessor, M r . Thomas, continuing up till then. M r . Thomas has
done a very good job as manager, setting the C o m p a n y on its feet and
making it run at a small profit. Unfortunately he felt he was operating
in a bit of a vacuum since most of the student directors really did not
have either the time or the technical expertise to really help h i m run the
Company. T o attempt to alleviate this problem the Company is setting
up a Management Committee, Hopefully this will have someone with
experience of the Travel Industry, outside our Company sitting on it. If
you happen to know a Director of Thomas Cook's, or some other Travel
firm, whom you think may be interested in assisting us, by sitting on this
Committee, then please let me know.
The C o m p a n y has three retail Manchester, Salford, Leicester,
outlets, one at 117, Euston Road,
one at Coldsmith's College and
one here. Yes here at I C in the
Union Lower Lounge,some-
where between the pinball
machines and the pool-table to be
precise and it is open between
11.00 a.m. and 2.00 p.m. on
Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays
and Fridays.
So what is there for you? Well,
if you live in Birmingham,
Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham or
Bradford I'm sure you will be
interested in the weekend return
coach trips for up to 4 pounds.
There are also free trips to the
U S A with B U N A C , and cut-price
air-flights to most p o p u l a r
holiday countries. So if you art-
planning a holiday why not go to
the Lower Lounge and see what
your C o m p a n y can offer you.
