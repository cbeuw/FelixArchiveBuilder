Virginity test shocks women
Immigrant women, arriving at Heathrow
airport, are being subjected to intimate
gynaecological examinations. The Home
Office claims that this helps to identify
women who are illegal immigrants.
The implication is that if a Hindu woman
was found to be a virgin - she would be
believed to be unmarried. Bona fide fiancees
are entitled to enter without going through
lengthy clearance procedures. If the woman
was found to be not a virgin she would be
believed to be married and would need
special clearance - an entry certificate
granted in her country of'origin.

The Liverpool area medical officer warned

are being stored in a disused electrical
factory.

present magnetic field.

moral or political beliefs should be imposed
on a student.

point of view than I am."
Be kinky - it's safer
Heart transplant specialist, Dr. Christian
Barnard, said that roadside jogging turns
some people on something crazy. Others
prefer ladies in chainmail bras, with leather
pants and a rack of whips. Dr. Barnard can't
for the life of him see the difference between
these "dangerous mania". If anything, he
says, a bout or two of sexual masochism or a
trip to a massage parlour tend to be a good
deal safer than jogging along the road.
Tuesday 6th
Irishman stuck in phone box
A new Irish joke was born yesterday but
this time it was a true story .... A n Irishman
couldn't find his way out of a telephone box.
At first he decided to wait until someone else
wanted to use the 'phone and then he'd be
able to dash out while the door was open.
However, it was three in the morning and so
he 'phoned the operator and she told the
police.
The Irishman, who had been drinking, was
quickly freed by two officers. The police have
advised the public that if they are stuck in a
telephone box the way to escape is as
follows...." The exit door is generally the one
you went in by. A n d if you can't remember
where it is, try pushing all the sides with glass
in them. Eventually one should open".

cooker.
