Romance in the air
The STA round the world quiz
Rumours are flying that the Bull-Lewis partnership
is about to come clean and go legit. An
unattributable source close to the Union promises
that the date for The Event is April 1 st, to be fol lowed
by a whirlwind round-the-world honeymoon in the
Easter vacation. We can reveal exclusively that an
aide, operating on behalf of the thrifty couple, has
approached the ULU Travel Office in Sherfield to
discover what a startling savings they can obtain on
their air fares.
Over the next five weeks we'll be giving you clues
as to the rou te they will be taking. These will be
announced on IC Radio every Friday. Fill in the
names of each destination on the schedule below.
After five weeks you will have the complete round
the world route costing £1,912 on scheduled
economy flights. Simply find out the STA fare for
this route (A big help will be that the price
concerned will be displayed on a poster outside the
Travel Office in the JCR). Add up the total saving
made and tell us why you prefer to fly with STA.
We were thinking of awarding as a prize a third
round the world ticket to go with the newly weds, but
on reflection we considered it more romantic to
,offer a weekend in Paris with the partner of your
choice. The winner and answers will be announced
in the last week of term and the holiday must be
booked before June 30. The competition is not open
to students working on Felix or IC Radio.
This week's clue to destination b):-
Presidents pose with Mickey Mouse where
nowadays the Angels may fear to go.
The lucky winner of last year's super
competition-she won a weekend in Paris.
