Simple blood..
Blood Simple, by Joel and
Ethan C o e n . (John Getz,
Frances M c D e r m a n d , Dan
Hedaya) Dir: Joel Cohen.
Freekin ay, Marty! We shot
y a once for c h r i s ' s a k e s .
Watcha want me to do, bury
you or something? Come on,
man, stop being stupid and lie
down in the hole will ya?!'.
Blood Simple is a hearty
a t t e m p t by t h e C o h e n
brothers (collaborators on
The Evil Dead andThe XYZ
Murders), to turn a complex,
but fairly average, murder
story into the sophisticated
and romantic movie that
Palace Pictures seem J o
adore.
The result is a long winded
joke. Deep in the Texas prarie,
Marty (Dan Hedaya), is on the
tail of his emplyoee, (John
Getz), who is having an affair
with this wife. He hires a
private detective to turn hit-
man, but plans backfire as the
detective takes the law into his
own hands. After that I'm
afraid I got lost. Marty is killed
several times, along with his
rival in passion, shots ring out
all over the neighbourhood
and as the ensuing fracas
reaches a climax, Texas
Police Dept doesn't twitch a
beer gut.
Essentially, the framework
of the film is sound. A s it
evolves, however, the film is
h e a v i l y o v e r l a i d w i t h
numerous a n d c o n f u s i n g
production techniques which
are neither compatible nor
necessarily effective, making
the plot i n t a n g i b l e a n d
smothering the audience in
grotesque and over emphatic
imagery: Blood Simple turns
out to be 'simple blood'.
'I don't know what you're
talking about honey' sneers
Marty to his rival. Frankly, he's
not the only one.

BOOKS
...for
simplicity
is all
Sorry, but paisley is out.
Tartan, too. Just after you had
re-structured your wardrobe
for the Autumn. This, of
course, will place severe
restraints upon your choice of
reading matter. We are now
back to minimalist covers to
match the new jazz-babe
image. Miller's works in
G r a n a d a are f l a s h e s of
fluorescents on lots and lots
of black. They are IN. Sartre in
Penguin with the Cubist
reproductions is O U T . Also
see Faber's version of Samuel
Becket's Waiting For Godot
for a lovely line drawing on a
white background. Cool play,
too. G o for Michael Ondaa-
tje's Coming Through The
Slaughter. A groovy cover,
inside it's all about a really
mean trumpet player. Suck it
and watch it soar. This is next
year's Cult Book.
And now for the other kind.
The sort of book you buy with
a S m i t h ' s gift v o u c h e r ,
because your Auntie forgot
that the poor, benighted firm
has given up any commitment
to books in favour of Travel
Agency. WARNING: do not
read the following book in
public unless it is hidden
behind a copy of A vant Guard.
Your blush of embarassment
would ruin the whitewash
pallor which is the pseudo-
intellectuals' equivalent of a
ski-holiday tan.
The Name of the Rose:
according to the New York
Times 'Umberto E c o has
written a novel and it has
become a literary event'. Well,
that might be true, but surely
this can't be the one they
mean. Either the reviewer
watches Dallas (subtract ten
IQ points) or someone sent
him atrunkloadof CaneSugar
and an invitation to a Playboy
photo-session. Not that the
book is bad. Just ordinary. A
competent whodunnit and
w h o g i v e s a t o s s set in a
fourteenth century m o n -
astery. I note from the blurb
that Anthony Burgess says 'I
rejoice and the rest of the
literate worldwill rejoice'.This
pontificating old wanker is
surely not without motive in
dribbling like that. Both he
a n d M r E c o a r e p o p
academics, and both make the
mistake of believing that the
random insertion of snippets
of scholarship into mediocre
books will convert them into
art. This makes Burgess'
modest claim to be part of 'the
literate world' worth rather
less than his bank balance.
Perhaps even less than the
Editor's bank balance, but I
doubt it. A n d while we're on
the subject, let's look at an
example of the literate chap's
work. Earthly Powers is a nice,
thick, heavy book of the kind
that people should donate to
t h e N a t i o n a l U n i o n of
Mineworkers. It would help in
their peaceful struggle for the
d e m o c r a t i c w o s s n a m e to
chuck this sort of thing at
policemen. If anyone made
them read it, however, I would
definitely agree that miners
are horribly oppressed.
Many authors rely to some
extent upon 'suspension of
disbelief. That is to say, you
have to accept the premises of
the book to allow the story to
develop. I n Earthly Powers the
reader is asked to believe in
the existence of a family
comprising two Hollywood
cel-ebrities, a homosexual
novelist and the Pope. Anyone
who swallows that could
cheerfully believe in a Humber
Bridge made out of Lego. In
fairness I must concede that
Burgess does have a point to
make about the nature of
religionâ€”but a better writer,
less concerned with sounding
clever, could have said the
same thing in a fraction of the
space.
Enough of the lousy stuff.
Let's finish on a better plane.
Many writers have lessons to
learn from V S Naipaul. Look
at Guerillas for a perfect
n o v e l , a n d Among the
Believers for perfect travel
writing. There is a sound,
' o r g a n i c ' f e e l t o t h i s
structuring. He knits the parts
of his themes and plots so
closely that they might have
grown that way. At the same
time, he can leave just enough
loose ends to make the thing
real, without damaging its
symmetry. The word-by-word
excellence of the prose is a
joy. Precise. Exact. Right. The
man never s l i p s . W h e n
S a l m a n R u s h d i e got the
Booker Prize for Midnight's
Children the press were fond
of saying 'at last, the Third
World has found a voice'. In
fact, it had just found a
political John Irving. Naipaul
has the voice worth hearing,
but he makes books, not
headlines.
