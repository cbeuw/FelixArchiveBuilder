SURROGATE FATHERHOOD
Cash in hand
Everyone knows that the way to succeed in business is to
satisfy a basic human need, and surely no-one would deny
that many childless couples want a baby more than
anything else. But is Harley Street running a 'babies for
sale' store under a different name? And are IC students
helping? A FELIX correspondent reports.
The technique of Artificial
Insemination by Donor (AID)
has been practiced in Britain for
over 40 years. It is responsible for
over 1000 births per year in this
country alone, and the figure is
still rising.
AID uses donor sperm to
inseminate women whose
husbands are infertile. The
donors are carefully screened for
genetic diseases, and after
acceptance they are matched in
physical appearance to the
husband. Donors must also be of
reasonable intelligence, and are
often University students, in
particular medics. Donors are
typically paid £5-£ 10, and are not
told if they have caused a
conception, although they will be
removed from the list of donors
after several successful
pregnancies due to the risk of
unintentional incest between his
'children'. The name of the
woman's husband appears on the
birth certificate, and every effort
is made to involve him at
counselling, conception, and
birth.
The actual cost of the process
can be relatively small, between
£75 and £400. Normally only two
or three attempts at fertilisation
are required before success, the
semen being introduced into the
womb at the right stage in the
menstrual cycle. The operation
takes only about five minutes,
and a woman can be in and out of
the clinic in less than an hour.
AID children have been the
objects of extensive studies. Ten
years after birth their families
tend to be more emotionally
stable than those of 'normal'
children, and there are relatively
few one parent families with AID
children.
'Height? Eye colour? Hair
colour? Build?' The receptionist
took my details down over the
phone. 'Monday at 12.15 OK?'.
Apparently some people are in
more demand than others. Do
you want your baby to look like
Paul Newman, Omar Shariff,
me?
I arrived quarter of an hour
early and took a seat in the
waiting room. The others were
either couples or women on their
own. A check of their fingers
revealed that everyone else was
married. The walls were
plastered in press cuttings. 'NEW
HOPE FOR THE CHILDLESS'
'BORN....THANKS TO
BOFFINS', the headlines
shouted good news for the
infertile. The women were 25-40,
mostly typical Guardian readers
I thought—baggy sweaters and
corduroy trousers. They did not
all seem so affluent. One man had
the rough hands of a labourer,
which he kept tightly pressed
against his wife's. One or two
seemed nervous, tapping their
fingers against the arm of a chair
or flicking absentmindedly
through the pages of the
Observer Colour Supplement.
Would one of these women end
up bearing my child? A man
walked through, his Barclays
Bank Cheque book open.
My turn came soon enough. A
nurse explained everything
matter-of-factly.
'Just provide a specimen, and
we'll examine it, and ask you a
few questions.' She handed me a
small disposable plastic
container, with a clip fit lid.
'There's a toilet up the stairs'.
The new word in medicine is
'involvement'. If you haven't sat
in a lab while three nurses sit
examining your semen under a
microscope then you haven't
lived. 'Density is plus two,' one
said. 'White blood cell covint is
15,' said another. I was invited to
look down a microscope, and felt
rather like a schoolboy being
given a guided trip round a
museum. As the gang of three
checked my virility I began to
wonder—am I doing right.
Undoubtedly many students at
IC have been semen donors. It
can be looked on as 'just another
way of making money'. The
opportunities available are
advertised in the student press.
However, how many students
have thought about the ethics
involved? Is it your fault that a
baby has been born with a
genetically carried disease? It is
theoretically possible for
children to trace their genetic
father. Do you have a son or
daughter that you don't know
about?
'Well, all the tests we've done
are OK, if you'lljust answer a few
questions then you'll be finished.
Possibly the most important
advance of civil rights in the UK
last year was the passing of the
Data Protection Act. This Act
allows anyone to see data held on
them on a computer, and will
have repercussions for IC and its
students primarily because of its
impact on examination marks.
The Act applies to any data
describing an individual that is
held on a computer, and allows
him or her to view, correct, and
erase it (if it is faulty), and claim
compensation if it is incorrect.
The Act applies to any computer,
from your lecturer's BBC micro
to ICCC. It is undoubtedly going
to affect access to exam marks.
These have been prepared and
processed on computers for
many years, and departments
with highly modular courses and
large numbers of students could
not operate any other way.
Currently, all that is given to a
student is a grade. No student is
able to see the 'raw' examination
results, and because of this can
not make a sensible appeal. This
has the effect of insulating
departments from criticism
about the way papers are set and
marked. The University of
London even has a regulation
forbidding the disclosure of this
information, and this regulation
will have to be changed in the
light of the Act. Colleges will also
have to allow access to personal
data held on computers such as
opinions and disciplinary
records.
Any history of mental illness in
the family...are you a
homosexual...heavy smoker...
academic record?'. Surely I
didn't need A-level biology—it's
not as if I was applying for a
scholarship at Cambridge after
all. Still, the patients are paying,
and I suppose they expect the
best.
'If you could drop in sometime
next week when we finish all the
tests we'll let you know the
situation. We pay £8 during the
week, and £11 at weekends — we
don't like using it frozen if
possible, as it's much better
fresh'. Thirty seconds later I
stood blinking in the sunlight of
Harley Street, as the Volvos and
Ford Granadas roared up and
down. A young woman hurried
past me, back up the stairs and
into the clinic.
'Good luck' I thought.
Departments are now faced
with a choice. They can remove
examination mark processing
from the computers, comply with
the law but change as little as
possible, or go farther than the
law demands.
The former is impossible for
most departments for the above
reason, and the College has
accepted that examination marks
will still be processed on
computers, with all the
implications that entails.
One option that the College
could take would be for each
student to be sent a copy of all the
data that was held on him. He
would then be invited to
comment on it and correct any
errors.
Whether or not this is
implemented, there is no doubt
that the Act is going to mean that
College will be involved in
considerable expense, to write
software for all the administ-
rative computers, and the
subsequent operation of the
inquiry system.
The new laws will begin to be
enforced in Autumn 1987, just in
time for this year's first years to
get legal right of access to their
final examination results. The
benefits of the Act could be felt
long before then, however,
because it may start a significant
change in the way Colleges store
student data, leading to a more
open, and fairer, system.
Protecting what?
