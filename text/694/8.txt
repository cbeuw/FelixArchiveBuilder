There were no correct solutions to last fortnights puzzle
so I will use it again just in case someone can solve it.
Four Heads of Department have decided they can
stand it no longer, and have decided to end it all with a
one-way visit to the Queen's Tower. Each Head faces the
tower, which is 70 yards away from them, in the directions
N,S,E and W.
Sadly, although each has read a great deal about the
history and architecture of the building, no one
recognises it in front of them. After a few moments'
thought each decides that it would be easiest to follow
someone else, hence turns to the person on their left and
follows then at 1 yd/sec.
If they are to reach the tower at all, how long will it take
them to do so?
Prize winners for the last puzzle can now collect their
cheques from the FELIX Office.
