LSPORT
WATER POLO
IC Water Polo team travelled to!
Warwick last weekend for the
play off for the last place in the;
UAU finals. Due to a lack ofI
information regarding thei
arrangements, we arrived at
Ham to find that the tournament j
started at 1pm. We also
discovered that our first match
wasn't until 2pm, although it
enabled us to evaluate the
strength of the opposition before
we played.
Since only one team would go
through to the finals, it was
hardly surprising that there was a
lot of tension, and the first match
was marred by a large number of
silly fouls. However, Lough-
borough's tactics of fighting all
the way paid off when they
finished 4-2 winner over Cardiff.
The second match was IC vs
Leeds. Leeds made a strong start
and scored the first goal, but
after surviving two corners, IC
scored three times to go into a 3-
1 lead at half time. The second
half went Leeds' way and they
scored twice to our once, but
thanks to a saved penalty by
Dave Wall, IC won 4-3.
The obviously impartial
arrangements continued with IC
having five minutes rest before
playing Loughborough (who
were twice in the position of
playing a team that had just
completed a game). Imperial
again went a goal down from the
start but fought back to be at two
all at half time with both sides
fighting hard to gain an
advantage. The start of the
second half showed an IC revival
and after a heavy series of raids
on the Loughborough goal we
were 5-3 up, with goals by Rob
Eastman and Stuart Chorlton.
This wasn't to last, and while IC
became complacent (and tired),
Loughborough became more
determined and scored four
goals to our one, thus winning 7-
6.
The next match was
memorable for one thing. The
Cardiff goalkeeper was sent out
and while he was watching from
the side his defence were able to
repel the Leeds attack.
For the second â€¢ time in the
tournamant Loughborough were
able to play a team that had just
18
completed a match, and it is
hardly surprising that they were
5-0 winners against Leeds in an
undistinguished game.
The final match was IC vs
Cardiff. Neither side had a
chance of winning the
tournamnet, so it was played in a
more friendly spirit than the
other games. In the end we drew
4-4, with IC coming second in the
tournamant. Our man of the
tournament award goes to the
captain for being joint top scorer
while being sent out five times in
three matches.
FOOTBALL
Bernard Sunley 2, Holbein 2
In the game billed as the game of
the season, two closely matched
teams battled in the snow on an
icy pitch. It was a highly
competitive and physical game,
and the final score is probably a
fair reflection on the balance of
play.
For the first twenty-five
minutes both teams struggled to
find their feet and create an
opening. However, the flair and
speed of Andrew Lett ensured
that Bernard Sunley maintained
the upper hand.
This period of the game was
not without incident. A 30 yard
shot by the Holbein captain Paul
Bravery cannoned off the post,
centre-forward Andy Keelin
skied the ball over the bar from
inside the six yard box, and
Bernard Sunley right wing
Francis Katelture failed to make
use of an overhit cross in front of
an open goal. The breakthrough
came when a careless backpass
by Holbein's centre back Phil
Clapp was intercepted by
Richard Dobedoe, who in an
uncharacteristic display of cool
finishing took the ball around the
keeper and slotted it ruthlessly
into the net.
Bernard Sunley now took the
upper hand and another goal by
Dobedoe, beautifully set up by
Kervick Sayers left Bernard
Sunley 2-0 up at the interval.
Holbein came back with a
vengeance in the second half,
and Bernard Sunley did well to
hold off the intense pressure until
twenty minutes from the end. In
a goalmouth scramble Neil
Broekhuisen managed to put the
ball past the Bernard Sunley
keeper.
SAILING
Score: Pete H. 1 sinking; Pete R.
2 capsizes.
Last Saturday two teams from IC
travelled to Datchet in order to
sail against Brunei University's
team and the University of
London second team.
The Imperial teams, being
amongst the greatest tactitions
of the sailing world, pulled off the
incredible manoevre of staying in
the warm clubhouse while
Brunei and UL2 battled it out in
the cold early in the morning.
However, the time came that
Imperial had to go out and do
battle. Preparations started by
the two Imperial teams racing
each other.
When the start gun went it was
Tony for the Pinkies who took
the lead with his team mate Pete
close behind. However, the wind
by this time had picked up
considerably and as the fleet
turned down wind boats started
wiping Out sending their
occupants into the extremely
cold water. While most people
managed to get their boats
upright without too much
difficultly Pete and Kate where in
the unfortunate position of
finding their boat sinkng after a
capsize. In a dramatic rescue
they were plucked from the icy
waters. The boat was rescued
later in the day, by then nearly
completely submerged.
TABLE TENNIS
The first team are hoping for a
better second half to the.season
in division two of the Central
League. Currently bottom of the
division they received a minor set
back last week by losing to the
only team they beat in the first
half. However the team should
be back up to full strength soon
when David Rhodes recovers
from Christmas and hopefully
turns all those 5-4 losses into 5-4
wins this time around.
Team two of division four
suffered two unwelcome defeats
at the end of last term and the
first match this term and so have
dropped to fourth in the division.
Not to be put off they pulled off
an excellent victory against City
University with ony two out of
three players. Thanks go to Pong
Leung who gave one of their
players only his third defeat of
the season.
The third team, division five,
are being more forthcoming with
information this term and are
showing that persistence pays
off. After losing virtually every
game last half 5-4, they are now
putting in good victories. Special
mention must go to L Sabotinov
for his consistent good form.
The fourth and fifth teams of
division six are plodding along.
Not much is known about either
of the teams except that five beat
four in the first week this term
and then four went to the
London School of Economics
and scored a good victory over
them despite the latter being
third in the table. All team lists
are status quo ante.
10-PIN BOWLING
Yippee! Good news for once! On
Saturday the dregs of the IC
Bowling Club went to Heathrow
to play in the Brunei University
Doubles Tournament and,
surprise surprise, one pair won
the competition over about 70
teams!
The tournamnt was staggered
over six sessions, all three IC
teams in the first and fourth
sessions. At the end of the
morning session, the team of
Kevin Short and Andy Yue led by
over a hundred pins, a huge
amount. A second IC Team,
Chris Wheeldon and Paul
Stewart were lying second.
After a long pub lunch, the
intrepid six went back to the alley
for the last three games, and
proceeded to play even better
than in the morning. Chris got his
finger out for once to keep his
team in the top three and Ian
Smith scored a 'freak' high game
and nearly won the trophy for the
highest game of the day.
In the end, Kevin and Andy
won, with Paul and Chris third.
Kevin also won a trophy for
highest series (three games) of
the day. All this happened, of
course, against all the principal
university sides of the country.
Self-congratulation all round!
Teams: Kevin Short and Andy-
Yue, Chris Wheeldon and Paul
Stewart, John Ballard and Ian
Smith.
