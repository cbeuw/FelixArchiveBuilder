BRIEF...
A four-week course in self!
defence for women, with police
instructors, is to begin on
Thursday 21 February at 6pm.
It will consist of a lecture, two I
demonstrations and practice
sessions
Anyone interested in
participating should contact Jen
in the Union Office before.
5.30pm on Monday 4 February.
In the outcry surrounding
Oxford University's decision not
to award the Prime Minister,
Margaret Thatcher an honorary
degree, it has gone widely
unnoticed that the Rector, Lord
Flowers was awarded an
Honorary Doctorate at the same
meeting of the Congregation of
the University. The presentation
will take place on June 26 1985.
The students of Imperial College
will have a chance to air their
views on aspects of student life
such as study and accommo-
dation. As reported in last week's
F E L I X , the College has
commissioned two promotional
videos upon which student
volunteers w i l l appear.
Interviews are to be recorded on
Tuesday 12 February. Anyone
interested in instant stardom
should contact Jen in the Union
Office as soon as possible. The
films will be shown during the
Guilds Centenary celebrations.
Students have been requested not
to remove braille stickers which
have been attached to lifts in the
Huxley Building and Weeks
Hall. They are to aid a blind
student in the Department of
Mathematics.
The Haldane Library which has
been closing at 5.30pm since last
term will soon remain open
during full Lyon-Playfair library
hours. Access to the library
during normal working hours
will be through the entrance in
the Sherfield building and, at
weekends and in the evening,
through the connecting door
from Lyon-Playfair. This will
come into effect as soon as a
security barrier is fitted at the
Sherfield Entrance.
The Rector, Lord Flowers was
discharged from St Stephens
hospital, Chelsea, last Friday
having made a good recovery
from a heart attack (miocardial
infarction) he sustained on 15
January.
He is not expected to return to
full duties until the Summer
term.
