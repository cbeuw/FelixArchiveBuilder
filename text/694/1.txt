Student Services
Re-shuffle
Mr Michael Arthur is to leave the Student Services Office
after four years in the job. The new Student Services
Officer is to be Mr Donald Ferguson, who is presently an
Adminstrative Officer in the College Secretary's Office.
The re-shuffle will take place on July 1 1985.
The announcement of the
changes on Monday came only
hours after angry Fremantle
residents staged a sit-in in Mr
Arthur's office. The students
were concerned that the roof of
the Fremantle has collapsed, the
heating is inoperative and there
are numerous water-leak ages.
Mr Arthur later admitted that
he had not realised how bad the
Fremantle Hotel had become,
although he denied that the
students had staged a sit in.
'They just happened to be
sitting on the floor of my office
while I drew up a list of their
complaints'.
The heating at the Fremantlej
has now been repaired after Mr
Arthur's prompt action in
contacting the landlords.

Guilds
President
slams
ski-holiday
students
Maribel Anderson, C & G U
President, yesterday told FELIX
that she was disappointed in the
way students were treating the
week of centenary celebrations as
a holiday, rather than supporting
the organised events.
All lectures in City and Guilds
department have been cancelled
for three days, and Miss
Anderson is upset that some
students are using this period to
go on skiing trips, or are simply
taking a three day break. This
view is also shared by many
members of staff who feel there
ought to be a greater student
involvement in the centenary
arrangements.
Events taking place include the
Centenary Banquet, to be held at
the Guildhall on Wednesday
February 27, which 75 current
C&G students will attend. The
week opens with a Masquerade
Ball on Monday 25 and there will
also be a Centenary Carnival on
Friday 1 March.
A special supplement featuring
Imperial College will appear in
The Times on February 27.
