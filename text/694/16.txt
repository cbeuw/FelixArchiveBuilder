SINGLES
Monochrome Set: Jacobs
Ladder
Both 'Everything But The
Girl' 'Monochrome Set' have
now moved from Cherry Red
to Blancoy Negro. This istheir
first single on the new label.
Fast and full of fun, 'Jacobs
L a d d e r ' h a s a l m o s t a n
evangelical choir sound to it
but maintaining the acoustic
western guitar and 50's R and
B feel the band are known for.
Without doubt the best single
released this week. A l s o
without doubt, it doesn't stand
a chance in the charts.
Jim Diamond: I Sleep Alone At
Night
The wimpy half of PhD
could not have dreamed of the
success of his first solo single
'Should Have Known Better'. I
suspect however, this second
release will disappoint him as
it has disapppointed the rest
of us. Face it Jim, you're not
cut out to do Mick Jaggger
impressions — especially over
a funky beat. It's no wonder he
has to sleep alone!
Santana: Say it Again
This is so awfully 70s. This
man is good — his rock guitar
work simply brilliant. How on
earth could he have been
reduced to singing cheap Pop
songs with one bar tunes and
one line lyrics? Yeuch.
Combo Zombo: Zom-Bee-
Eye-Eee
After considerable demand,
I agreed to review Snack Bar
Manager Norman Jardine's
new band (Hyping even
reaches Felix!). This 3 track
12 inch EP has a strangely
S a l s a s o u n d g i v e n the
distinctly biting indie edge. I'd
love to see them live —
especially the lead guitarist,
Tiger Lemon-Tea, who seems
to stick random breaks all over
the songs no matter what
everyone else is doing. Tell
you what it reminds me of —
early stuff by T h e Beat'. G o o d
stuff—can I have a free
Unionburger now, Chuck?
Person To Person: Reputation
Nice enough — an open
sound very professionally
performed with fast moving
and well structured produc-
tion. Even one of my favourite
'double harmonies' half way
through. A bit weak though.
Maybe after Combo Zombo
anything sounds weak!

CINEMA
Amadeus
F Murray Abraham, T o m
Huke, Elizabeth Berridge, Roy
Dotrice, Jeffrey Jones. Play
and screenplay by Peter
Shaffer and Directed by Milos
Forman.
This rhapsody of a film is
based on the life of Mozart
(according to Shaffer) as
recollected by Antonio Salieri,
a composer in Vienna. Salieri
struck, in his youth, by an
afflatus for composition is
t o r t u r e d b o t h by t h e
k n o w l e d g e of h i s o w n
mediocrity and his ability to
appreciate the genius of
Mozart. T h e increasingly
disconsolate Salieri becomes
intent on the destruction of
t h e y o u n g W o l f g a n g
Amadeus
The film is all very slick, but
works rather well. One reason
may lie in the quality of the
performances. For instance
Abraham brings out very
convincingly the struggle
between light and dark within
Salieri as well as making his
pain identifiable. Also Huke
p r o d u c e s a fine Mozart
balancing the childish with
the arrogant.
Another plus is the music.
The alternate dulcet and
dramatic sterophonics, piping
out of the dolby, sound good,
up-lifting even. But the music
is neatly tailored to fit the
drama and the grandeur,
which is line with the general
s l i c k n e s s is all cleverly
photographed to good effect.
The film is sometimes quite
riveting and often funny, its
certainly a banquet for eyes
and ears. So if you're taking
them out for a treat you could
do far worse.
