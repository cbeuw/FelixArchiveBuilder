POSTGRADUATE
HANDBOOK
The first IC Union Postgraduate
Handbook was published earlier
this week.
The 32 page booklet is a new
venture for the Union this year
and is targeted at final year
undergraduates who are
considering progressing to an
MSc or PhD in the coming year.
The subject matter covered
essentially forms an introduction
to postgraduate life. Areas
tackled are postgraduate
funding, the structure of MSc
and PhD courses, prospects after
graduating and a look at the
postgraduate way of life, There
are also personal views from
postgraduate students on what
MSc and PhDs are like and lists
of MSc courses and research
areas available at Imperial.
The Handbook is available
free from the Union Office now
and will become available from
departmental postgradaute
tutors over the coming week.
The founding editor of the
Handbook was Hugh Stiles, a
Chem Eng postgrad and
Chairman of the Union
Recreational Clubs Committee.
Submission rates
cause concern
Two recent surveys have revealed
that only an average of 33% of
PhD students have submitted
theses at the end of four years —
one year after the expected
completion date.
The surveys published by the
Science and Engineering
Research Council (SERC) and
the Economic and Social
Research Council (ESRC), detail
submission rates for PhD degrees
by award holders who began
their research in 1979 and cover
the four-year period up to the end
of 1983.
Under the SERC submission
rates vary between 86.7%
(Lancaster) and nil (Ulster) with
an average of 47.8%. IC stands at
51.9%. For the ESRC the figures
are between 60.0% and 7.7% with
an average of 27.2%. The latter
survey does not give a figure for
Imperial because it had less than
ten ESRC award holders for the
period under review.
The reasons for this scatter are
difficult to pin down. Admittedly
the article in last week's FELIX
showed that first class and upper
second class degrees are easier to
come by at certain universities,
but even so the overwhelming
majority of students who
undertake research should be
academically able. (A first or
upper second class degree is a
requirement for holding a
research council award).
It is a fact that if the student
fails to complete in three years
(the length of the grant) he often
takes up employement, rather
than write up on social security.
The result is that the
opportunities and incentive to
write up diminish and the degree
is left uncompleted.
The obvious question is why
do so may students submit late?
The answer must be because they
do not leave enough time at the
end of the project to write up.
The SERC have recognised this
problem and in the booklet
Research Student and Supervisor
(an approach to good supervisory
practice) they reccommend that a
period of six months be set aside
for writing up.
It seems certain that the use of
transfer theses at the end of the
first year can only help the
student when it comes to writing
up since at least the core of the
literature survey should be
complete not to mention part of
the experimental and result
sections.
Another factor with low
submission rates is that fresh
graduates are unprepared for the
rigours of a three year research
degree. Their level of awareness
of the degree structure (let alone
the pitfalls) is often woefully
inadequte. To try and combat
this ignorance IC Union has just
published the 'Postgraduate
Handbook'.
Academics
suffering
tenure
itch
Academic freedom in Britain's
universities could be under threat
from government proposals to
limit academic tenure.
Tenure means that academic
staff can only be dismissed with
'good cause', such as extensive
plagiarism, or assaulting another
member of staff. When
universities need to lose staff due
to grant cuts then this must be
achieved by natural wastage and
early retirement.
The government is considering
legislation to allow universities to
shed staff on the grounds of a
'change in finanial circum-
stances', or that a given
department is felt to be of no
further value. Although the
government claim that 'academic
freedom' will not be comprom-
ised, the Association of
University Teachers is opposed
to the change, saying that 'the
removal of tenure will seriously
weaken the ability of academics
to deploy their critical and
creative faculties in the face of
governmental expediencies'.
The AUT fears that measures
ostensibly introduced to help
universities reduce academic
staff who can no longer be
afforded, would allow 'unpop-
ular' members of staff to be
purged, and make it impossible
for academics to fly in the face of
received wisdom about the worth
of a given area of research.
Research would be able to be
channelled into specific, possibly
'safe' areas, and members of staff
who disagreed would be able to
be removed supposedly on the
grounds of financial expediency.
The situation is furthur
complicated by the fact that
Imperial College claims that
academic staff have no tenure, as
a clause is written into
academic's contract of-
employment, allowing dismissal
with five months notice. This
however has never been tested.
