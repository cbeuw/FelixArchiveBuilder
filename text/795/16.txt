Burway and the Blues
The Star Novice Crew
Having missed Henley 4s Head due
to flooding of the Thames, Burway
Head was the first chance this year
for most members of the club (except
the 1st eight who were rowing
Cambridge) to find out how good
their winter's training had been. The
Four's division was held first with
four Imperial crews racing. The
second eight having split into two
coxless fours impressed both with
their rowing and their new lycra skin
tight rowing suits winning both Elite
coxless (fastest four overall) and
Senior II coxless (3rd fastest overall).
The Senior III coxed four also rowed
well to win their class comfortably.
The stars were however, the novices,
who following 5 months rowing
under the coaching of J Pop O'Brien
won their division by the margin of
1 min and 32 seconds (pretty good
over a 12 min race). All in all four
wins out of four was not too bad.
In the eights division, Imperial had
entries in the Senior 1 and Novice
categories. Unfortunately, some
rather inconsistent timing led to a few
odd results, one of which meant that
the IC Novice eight did not win,
however, the second eight rowing in
the Senior 1 category won their
division quite comfortably.
Once again the Club found its
resources overstretched and the
ladies' boat could not be transported
to Burway. It was regrettable that the
ladies crew did not find any of the
substitute boats suitable, so they did
not row.
IC 1st Eight V Cambridge
Last weekend saw the IC 1st Eight
race the Cambridge 'Blue' boat in a
private competition at Ely, just
outside Cambridge. The Cambridge
Eight stroked by ex-ICBC member
Guy Pooley, is probably one of the
best crews to challenge Oxford for a
number of years with an average
weight of 14 stone compared to
Imperials 12Vi stones.
The crews were to race over two
fifteen minute pieces on Saturday
followed by three five minute pieces
on Sunday. As expected, in the first
piece Cambridge took a Vi length lead
in the first minute but after eleven
minutes, had only managed to gain a
1 length advantage and finished the
piece only some 2 lengths clear. In
the second piece, Cambridge started
with a slight lead and Imperial again
fought a hard race only losing by
about 5 lengths.
Sunday's five minute rows
provided some very good racing
between the crews with attempts by
both coxes to gain the advantage
round bends. Both crews pushed
continuously through the pieces, IC
at times rating 40 strokes per minute.
The final five minute race proved the
most exciting with Cambridge getting
a slight lead off the start and Imperial
then fighting back all through the
piece to end only some l
k a length
down. In all, the weekend proved
very successful in giving some strong
competition to both crews and
hopefully the race experience gained
will prove valuable in the weeks to
come.
Two halves
Imperial College—2
London Hospitals—2
The severe weather conditions
dominated the game. London
Hospitals won the toss and elected to
kick against the ferocious wind. IC
dominated the first half knowing that
they would have to take advantage of
the wind.
IC scored the first goal mid-way
through the first half from a good
build up. The ball was passed from
the halfway line to N Collier who was
waiting on the edge of the box, he
volleyed it to the other side of the box
to Alan Glass who laid it in the path
of Paul Oden who scored.
The second goal came from a bad
back pass from a LH's defender
allowing Phil Ewart to score. At half-
time the score stood at 2-0 and IC
must have wondered whether they
had capitalised enough in the first
half.
Although L H were not a very
strong side IC were finding it hard to
clear the ball out of their half. Due
to the strong wind IC could only
manage a few attacks and spend most
of the time defending.
The referee awarded a dubious free
kick to LH on the edge of IC's box,
from which they scored. Their other
goal was to come from a free kick on
the left hand side of the pitch. The ball
was crossed and a LH player swung
at it and with luck and good
judgement it went into the top of the
goal.
The final score was 2-2 and it was
certainly a game of two halves.
6 - A - S I D E C R I C K E T
Inside out!
The qualifiying round of the UAU
indoor cricket championship was held
on Sunday February 21 at City
University; IC found themselves
drawn against U C L and Sussex
University, the other group being
Kent, Essex and LSE.
IC started impressively with a
comfortable win over UCL; Rajeev
Dewan top scored with 31 out of a
total of 114 from the alotted 12 overs,
UCL managing just 80 in reply.
With UCL also loosing to Sussex,
IC had to defeat Sussex to ensure a
place in the qualifying round final,
and a possible trip to Newcastle to
play in the National finals. After a
dreadful start IC were reeling at 4 for
2 and an already confident Sussex side
seemed certain to restrict IC to a very
low score. An aggressive partnership
between Punkaj Patel and Jagot
Fernando however, enabled IC to
reach and impressive total of 136 for
5. Sussex found what little confidence
they had left soon drained away as
they slumped to a dismal 51 all out.
Victory over Sussex saw IC reach
the qualifying final where they met
Essex who had scraped through as
winners of the other group after some
far from convincing performances.
After an excellent start to IC's innings
by Rajeev Dewan and Michael
Anderson, five confused run-outs
resulted in IC stumbling to a
disappointing 70 all out. Such a
modest total should have posed few
problems for Essex, yet they lost four
wickets and never looked
comfortable. Defeat resulted in IC
failing to reach the national final
despite producing the most impressive
cricket of the tournament.
S A I L I N G
IC at the helm
Last Saturday saw Imperial at its
home reservoir, racing against the
other main colleges of London for the
Castaways Cup. Four teams entered,
IC, QMC, Kings and the much
fancied UC.
Racing was initially organised in a
round robin style with teams racing
each other twice. The first race of the
day set Imperial against University
College. With two helms from the
London first team, UC looked the
team to beat. The race began with no
clear leader emerging at the first
mark. However, at the second mark,
indescribable sailing by Rob
Kimberly allowed Imperial to take a
commanding lead. Unfortunately a
mistake by the captain, caused by the
incessant arguing of his crew, allowed
UC back into the race, which they
eventually won.
After a re-arrangement of the team,
IC raced against QMC. From the start
Apostolos Leonidhopolous and
Richard Jarman established an
unbeatable lead which they hald all
the way round the course to give IC
their first win.
This set the scene for the remainder
of the qualifying races with Imperial
winning almost every race easily,
overwhelming Kings (twice) and
QMC (again) but only narrowly
defeating UC.
Thus IC qualified for the final
against QMC, who surprisingly had
beaten UC twice in the earlier rounds.
The final was to be the best of
three, but in the event QMC were
outclassed. Imperial won the first two
races easily, to become the top sailing
college in London.
