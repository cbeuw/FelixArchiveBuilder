More human
communication
takes place by the
use of gestures,
postures, position
and distances than
by any other
method. Non-verbal
communication is a
complex process
involving people,
words, tone of
voice and body
movements. This
special FELIX
feature examines
each component of
body language and
gesture, though few
gestures are made
in isolation from
others.
People have been communicating
with their bodies for thousands of
years, but it was only in the sixties
that scientists started to study this non-
verbal communication in any great
detail. The most influential technical
work before this period was Charles
Darwin's The Expression of the
Emotions in Man and Animals
published in 1872, where Darwin
detailed studies of facial expressions
and body language.
It was this communication skill
which made silent movie actors, such
as Charlie Chaplin, great. Each actor
was classed as good or bad by the
extent to which he could use gestures
and other body signals to
communicate effectively. When
talking films took over, many silent
movie actors faded into obscurity as
non-verbal were superceded by verbal
skills.
Albert Mehrabin has carried out
extensive research into body
language. He has found that the total
input of a message is about 7%
verbal, 38% vocal (tone of voice,
inflection, etc.) and 55% non-verbal.
Other researchers have estimated that
the average person actually speaks
words for a total of about ten or
eleven minutes a day and that the
average sentence takes only 2.5
seconds.
Most researchers generally agree
that the verbal channel is used
primarily for conveying information,
while the non-verbal channel is used
for 'negotiating interpersonal
attitudes'. Despite this, humans are
rarely aware of their postures,
movements and gestures and the
messages they convey.
Intuition
Technically, 'intuition' is a person's
ability to read another's non-verbal
cues. For instance, it is easy to tell
when somebody is lying because their
verbal and body languages do not
agree. Another example is that of an
Imperial College lecturer and his
students. If the students are sitting
back in their seats with chins down
and arms crossed on their chests, a
perceptive lecturer would get a feeling
that his delivery was not getting
across. Hopefully, he would become
aware that he needed to take a
different approach to gain audience
involvement. A non-perceptive
lecturer would carry on regardless.
(Recent student research has shown
that only 5% of IC lecturers are
perceptive.)
Women are generally more
perceptive than menâ€”the so-called
'female intuition'. They have an
accurate eye for detail and can
decipher non-verbal signals better
than their male counterparts. This is
why it is so easy for a woman to tell
when her husband is lying or to pull
the wool over his eyes.
Genetics or cultural?
Most of the scientific research that has
been done into body language has
concentrated on whether gestures are
determined by our genetics or our
cultural upbringing. The German
scientist Eibl-Eibesfeldt found that
smiling expressions of children born
deaf and blind occur independently of
learning or copying, which means that
these must be inborn gestures.
Ekman, Friesen and Sorenson
supported some of Darwin's original
beliefs about inborn gestures when
they studied the facial expressions of
people from five very different
cultures. They found that each culture
used the same basic facial gestures to
show emotion, which led them to the
conclusion that these gestures must be
inborn.
There is still a great debate as to
whether some gestures are culturally
learned or become habitual, or are
genetic. Most research indicates,
however, that much of our basic non-
verbal behavior.is learned and the
meaning of many movements and
gestures is culturally determined.
Origins
Most of the basic gestures occur all
over the world. Most nations smile
when they are happy and cry when
they are sad. Nodding the head means
'yes' and a shake means 'no'.
Scientists believe that these gestures
are inborn as they are also used by
blind people. When a baby has u
~ '
enough milk it will turn its head away,
seemingly shaking its head to reject
its mother's breast.
Baring the teeth can be traced back
to our primitive animal past. It is
derived from the act of attack and is
used today to indicate anger or
sneering.
The shoulder shrug is also a
universal gesture showing that a
person does not know or unders'"-J
It is a multiple gesture with three main
parts, exposed palms, hunched
shoulders and raised brow.
Misinterpretations
Some gestures mean different things
in different countries. The ' V sign',
so popular in this country, carries an
