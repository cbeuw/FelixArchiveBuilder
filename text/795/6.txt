OPINION
b y S t e v e E a s t e r b r o o k
On Tuesday a
motion was proposed
at the Extraordinary
General Meeting
calling for a paper
recycling scheme in
College. While
nobody objected to
this aim, the motion
was not accepted due
to a procedural
problem, however, it
will be re-submitted
to the next Union
General Meeting,
where it can be
discussed properly. I
hope the person who
blocked the motion
reads this article,
and realises that
before it can be
discussed again,
nearly one thousand
wild species will
disappear forever
from the world!
Q: What do you think of
it so far?
A: Rubbish!
Few people would deny that recycling
waste is a good thing, but how many
have thought deeply about the issues
involved? At present less than a
quarter of the paper in use is recycled,
but there is no reason why it could not
all be recycled. Simply recycling half
the paper in use in the world could
meet three quarters of the demand for
paper, and free 4 million hectares of
land from paper production. This
would be good news for Scotland,
where plantations devoted to a single
species are replacing beautiful
countryside, and especially good
news for Rainforests in Brazil which
are being torn up at a horrifying rate.
None of the huge amount of paper
used in College is recycled at present.
All it would take, however, is
everyone to save up their waste paper,
add a little effort spent on central
collection, and the wastage can end.
But simply collecting up our waste
paper isn't the end of the story. We
need to investigate the possibility of
using recycled paper throughout
College. The Bookshop must be
persuaded to stock recycled
stationery. Departments must be
persuaded to use recycled paper
where possible. We need to
investigate the use of recycled paper
for all the photocopiers and printers.
The only obstacles to overcome are
apathy and bureaucracy.
If the initial collection scheme
proves successful, we would like to
examine the possibility of setting up
our own pulping machine, and
producing our own paper. This will
save transportation costs, and could
save the College a large portion of it's
stationery budget. The scheme could
then be expanded to include
neighbouring establishments such as
the Natural History and Science
museums.
But what this all rests on is the need
for support. Volunteers are needed to
set up and monitor collection boxes,
and empty them at the central
collection point. Ideally there should
be a collection box in every hall and
house, and in every department.
Areas which consume large amounts
of paper need special attention, such
as photocopier rooms, near
pigeonholes, and in the Felix office!!
Start collecting right away, and
don't forget that cardboard,
newspapers and any form of paper
should all be saved. The only thing
to be wary of is plasticised paper—it
makes a mess of the recycling
machines. With your help we can
save the Rainforests.
The Rubbish Mountain
The problem of waste disposal is a
modern problem. Where once, the
only things to be found on old rubbish
tips were pieces of pottery and the odd
sickle blade, the contents of modern
waste tips will endure for a long time
to come. The archeologists of the
future will know what kinds of things
we ate, from the plastic wrappers, and
even the names of our shops, from the
carrier bags.
In Britain, we generate up to 75
kilograms each of rubbish every
month. The growth of this rubbish
WHAT YOU CAN DO
• Don't mix your rubbish. If you have a garden, organic kitchen
waste can be used as compost. Use separate bins to collect paper
(and cardboard), and glass.
• Boycott over-packaged products. Few products need more than
two layers of wrapping. Luxury items are the worst offenders: a
box of chocolates will often have as many as seven separate layers
of packaging.
• Buy in bulk. Bigger packets mean less waste packaging.
• Choose returnable containers where they are available. These
are the most effective and efficient way of re-cycling. Unfortunately
they have declined in number over recent years.
• Choose natural packaging. Cardboard and paper are preferable
to plastic, as they can easily be re-cycled. Similarly, glass bottles
are much better than plastic.
• Help your department to participate in re-cycling paper. Ensure
there is a recycling bin next to every photo-copier and printer. Offer
to help empty them from time to time.
• Keep a box in your office or room, for your own waste paper.
You'll be surprised how quickly it fills up.
• Buy re-cycled stationary where possible. It is available in a wide
range of qualities, and is now even available for photocopiers!
