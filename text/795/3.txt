GERBILL Attacks Imperial
Imperial College Union has called a
half day strike over it. The
Association of University Teachers
(AUT) and the Universities have
condemned it. The NUS are marching
tomorrow against it. What is it?
Kenneth Baker's 'Great Education
Reform Bill' is (or 'GERBILL' for
short) proposing the first major
reform of education since 1944. Why
is it causing so much concern?
The major changes to the
universities are in the way that central
funding is given out. At the moment,
a body called the University Grants
Commission (UGC) sits between the
Universities and the Government, and
contains a majority of representatives
of the universities, including the IC
College Secretary, John Smith. The
UGC advises the Government

T h e W o r i d b e a t e r s
Minister on what the universities
need, and decides how to distribute
funds passed from central
Government.
The GERBILL proposes that the
UGC is replaced by another body, the
University Funding Council (UFC),
which will contain a majority from
industry, commerce and finance. This
body will only have the power to do
what the Secretary of State tells it. It
will not be able to make
representations on behalf of the
Universities to the Government, but
is only there to distribute any cash
given to it, and even this will be under
the directions of the Minister. The
idea of the Bill is 'to achieve the right
number and balance of graduates in
the 1990s'. What they really mean is
that they want a higher education
system based only on the needs of
commerce and industry. Once the
universities are churning out industry-
orientated graduates, they can shift
the funding for these courses onto
industry itself.
To do this, however, they need to
break up the way universities are
funding at the moment to separate
funding for separate courses. To do
this they have suggested, in one
discussion document, the idea of
'contract funding'.
Contract Funding
The idea of contract funding is that
universities would have to put in
'competitive tenders' of how much it
would cost for them to educate so
many students, and the cheapest
would be awarded the contract and get
the funding. This has already
happened for a few courses started
recently. This has many implications,
not least for funding of student
services not directly connected with
one course or department;
accommodation, student unions,
welfare services and so on. All these
are an essential part of student life,
but with no mention in the GERBILL
at all. Contract funding itself is not
mentioned in the Bill either, but one
of the most worrying features of the
whole Bill is that it gives the Secretary
of State (be they Tory, Labour or
whatever) the power to introduce
major changes, like contract funding,
without even taking it through
Parliament. The Croham Report,
which recommended the formation of
the UFC, suggested that one of the
first jobs of the new UFC shall be the
introduction of contract funding.
The Robbins Principle
The Robbins Principle, from a report
in the 60s, says that Higher Education
should be available for all who can
benefit from it. The GERBILL
proposes a system where higher
education is based on the needs of
industry, not the students, and would
mean the effective abandonment of
the principle. Higher education would
be available to two groups, those that
are suitable for 'industry-orientated
courses', and those that can afford to
pay for other types of courses. Even
the industry-orientated courses may
be funded by loans, and there are
rumours that the Government will
attempt to introduce them again; last
time it was attempted, they withdrew
the proposals with a pending election
and objection from Tory parents.
The major courses that will be hit
are Arts and Social Science courses,
without a strong vocational content,
and obviously this will not affect
Imperial directly. However, with
industry 'calling the shots' in the
Universities, research will become
more orientated towards short term
industrial goals, and longer term and
more theoretical work will have
difficulty attracting industrial money.
Also, as research becomes more
based around industrial contracts, the
free flow of information between
individuals and research groups will
become restricted as research results
become 'trade secrets'.
Tenure
Another part of the Bill abolishes
'tenure', whereby academics are
given job security for life. Although
tenure does not exist at Imperial, its
abolition will allow academics to be
sacked, courses closed and
departments shut down purely on
financial grounds. More worrying is
that the Secretary of State will be able
to determine a lecturer's appointment,
and there will be little incentive to
question or criticize the Government.
More Students
The Bill proposes a 5 % increase in
student numbers, an extra 50,000 (ten
times the size of Imperial) by 1990,
and in the same period aims to cut
funding by £126m. The growth,
according to Baker, will have to come
from "better value for money" from
higher education. This at a time when
universities are already closing
departments and sacking staff to meet
Government targets. This is one of the
major omissions in the Bill; it
proposes large changes in the
University system, an increase in
student numbers, and a shift to the
more expensive 'industry-orientated'
courses, without addressing the issue
of how it is going to be paid for.
Another omission is that Student
Unions are not mentioned once in the
GERBILL. It does, however, give the
Minister the power to determine
exactly where money is spent within
the University system, and imposes
