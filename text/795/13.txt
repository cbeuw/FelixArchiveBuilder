Rain Parade and Carnival Day
While the likes of Debbie Gibson and
Tiffany dominate the charts, hundreds
of decent and genuinely talented
bands and artists go unnoticed...
This week I received what can only
be described as a totally brilliant demo
tape by a Salfordian duo called
Cleveland.
Two beautifully crafted tunes which
pluck tenderly and the heart strings.
Comparisons? Well they don't sound
dissimilar to McCartney, Miracle
Legion, R.E.M. with a bit
Manchester's finestâ€”The Smiths
thrown in for good measure.
For the measley sum of a quid, (and
a S.A.E.), you can't afford to ignore
these boys. They need your support!

Letter from St Mary's
Last week saw what was arguably the
most cultural event at St. Mary's for
a long time, certainly since I have had
the pleasure to reside here. Our
Dramatic Society staged a production
of Will Shakespeare's Twelfth Night
(or What You Will).
It is extremely difficult to carry off
such an ambitious project at the
Medical School with the style
required. The emphasis in recreation
here is fun with a capital 'F', hence
the temperance of artistic drive and
realism developing to the ideal choice
of Twelfth Night.
First performed in the Middle
Temple on 2nd February 1602 -
Candlemas Day, the play was
designed to be part of the winter
feasting, extending from St.
Andrew's Day to Shrovetide. The
play is a comedy, but carries a serious
social message, and is full of
contemporary comment.
It seems a shame to individualise
such a production, but certain names
must be mentioned. Jane Jones as
Viola was superb. Her sense of
timing, the delivery of lines, the
creation of the correct atmosphere and
general stage presence were
exemplary. The drunken duo of Sir
Toby and Sir Andrew exploited fully
the potential of the situation, carefully
resisting the temptation to produce a
complete farce. For this, praise must
be directed to Simon Edwards and
James Froner respectively.
Anna Parns played the fool
exquisitely mixing the comedy of the
part with the underlying serious
message often ignored in this play.
Richard Thomas as Orsino, David
Lavalette as Sebastian and David
Ketchin as Antonio all gave credible
performances.
Malvolio, the pompous puritan,
servant of Olivia who has grevious
wrong done to him by Fabian, Maria,
Sir Toby and Sir Andrew gave Julian
Cooper the part to exercise and stretch
his talent to fill the demanding role.
He lived up to expectations delivering
a stimulating performance.
The actors were well dressed in
primary colours, and the staging in
the form of an enchanted garden with
a hexagonal seat around a tree as the
centre piece provided a visually
interesting set, without overpowering
the acting."The lighting was simple
and functional, in keeping with the
production ethos.
In conclusion, Barns Morrice (the
director) and Kat Cooper (the
producer) have managed to give the
Medical School a cultural injection of
which we can all be proud, being as
good a production ever to be seen by
an amateur group, certainly the best
thing done here for a long while.
On a totally different topic, just to
inform you that St. Mary's mens
hockey team beat IC lsts in the
quarter finals of the ULU cup three
weeks ago, by a significant margin.
Red Hot Chilli Peppers
The Red Hot Chilli Peppers have
received a tremendous amount of
press recently due to their unusual
stage costumes: the entire group play
their set wearing one white sock each,
and nothing more. (No, they don't
wear them on their feet!). The
gimmick certainly worked because
it's got such mags as ID and The Face
interested in them and curious females
turning up to their UK gigs. They
recently played the Clarendon in
Hammersmith to packed houses. The
band actually hail from America's
West Coast, which probably accounts
for their strange taste in clothing.
Their first single to be released in
this country is on EMI and entitled
Fight Like A Brave. It is a lively little
number that has a persistent and
somewhat annoying bassline. The
bass tries too hard to be like that on
a Level 42 track and fails dismally.
The introduction is my favourite part
of the song and makes it seem quite
promising to begin with but it has a
tedious instrumental break half way
through and never recovers.
As far as vocals go, they are a mish
mash of New York style rapping a la
Beastie Boys and West Coast rock.
An interesting combination, which
means that the song has no hook and
is likely never to see the Top 40. The
lyrics are dead clever: Fight like a
brave, don't be a slave and If you 're
sick and tired of being sick and tired.
It obviously took them a long time to
think of that one!
I'm sure the boys look very
fetching in their socks but the vinyl
doesn't grab me, man. This record
doesn't do very much for me, but I
think that if they can sort out where
they're coming from they could make
some good music in the future.
Watch out for them on TOTP!

WANTED: more record, film,
stage and gig reviews. Pop into the

Manchester invaded
by SLAGS-official!
On Saturday a momentous event
occurred which was unfortunately
ignored by the press, (apart from an
inch in the Observer and a photo of
a man dressed as Maggie Thatcher in
the News of the World). What was
this event you ask? It was the 'Stop
Clause 28' rally in Manchester, of
course! 20,500 (Twenty thousand and
five hundred!) Gay and Lesbian
people marched through Manchester
streets, past the open-mouthed
Sharons and Barrys, ending up in
Albert Square, outside Manchester
Town Hall.
This was the biggest demonstration
in Manchester for T W E N T Y
YEARS, and the biggest gathering of
Gay and Lesbians ever!! Celebrities
such as Ian McKellan, Michael
Cashman (EastEnders "Colin")
Jimmy Sommerville, Linda Bellos
(Lambeth Council Leader) etc, etc,
etc, all turned up to march and speak.
I think the highlight of the day was
getting on the 8.20am train from
London Euston, and it was PACKED
with Gay people. Then a family got
on, and standing amongst 20
screaming queens, the woman asked
her husband "Do you think it's so full
because of the football match?"!!!
Everyone cracked up, but no-one had
the heart to tell her why it was full!!
Many thanks to all the
heterosexuals who turned up for the
march (obviously not everyone is a
neo-fascist in this country).
Lots of Love,
James Papa
PS. I have been in bed with flu all
week. Sorry if anyone has been trying
to contact me.
