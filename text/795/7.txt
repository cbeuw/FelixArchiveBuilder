mountain began in the post-war
economic boom. New production
methods meant greater capacity to
produce, and the introduction of self
service required highly packaged
products.
By the 1960's the marketing
industry had discovered how to
stimulate consumption. In order to
sell more and more, the industrialised
world was trained to discard and
replace everything, and frequently.
Attitudes to waste changed, and
consumerism became a way of life.
This encouragement to produce
rubbish is quietly assisted by the
effective waste collection service. By
removing rubbish as fast as it is
generated, it is hidden from the public
view. If it all stayed on the doorsteps,
people would think twice about
throwing things away.
Once the rubbish is collected, it
usually ends up on a rubbish tip. The
euphemism 'landfill site' is often used
to pretend that these rubbish dumps
serve some useful purpose. However,
they contain a lethal mixture of
solvents, pesticides, cleaning fluids,
and oil, along with rotting organic
waste, and huge volumes of
packaging and plastic. This poisonous
mixture soon begins to react.
Inflammable gases are released, and
chemicals such as mercury, nickel
and various solvents are washed
through the soil to appear in our
drinking water.
Burning the waste produces even
more pollution. Plastics and wood
preservatives give off dioxins as they
are burnt, which are among the most
poisonous substances known. The
smoke contains a lethal mixture of
fumes and adds to the problems of
acid rain. While burning rubbish for
energy sounds like a good idea, our
rubbish tips contain such a range of
materials that a host of expensive
filters and scrubbers are needed to
clean up the smoke produced.
The problems of what to do with
all this rubbish would be greatly eased
if it was sorted as it is discarded. A
number of constituents of the
domestic wastebin can easily be
recycled, as long as they are collected
separately.
Thirty percent of domestic waste is
organic material which makes
excellent compost. In the country,
organic waste should never be
collected—it can simply be returned
to the garden. In the city, this is a little
harder, but if collected separately,
organic waste can still be used for
compost. Several towns in Germany
already do this, using separate
dustbins for organic waste.
Glass can also be recycled. Broken
glass from bottle banks is added to
new molten glass in a furnace. The
result is a huge saving in the amount
of energy needed to produce glass.
Better still, returnable bottles require
even less energy to re-use.
Then of course there's plastic. The
great virtue of plastic is its durability.
However, this makes it totally
inappropriate for most of the uses to
which it is put. For instance, a carrier
bag, which will last for centuries, is
only used for perhaps a few days.
Worse still, foam polystyrene is used
for fast food containers which are
often only used for a few minutes—
to keep the food warm long enough
to leave the restaurant!
Disposing of plastic is a tricky
business. Both burning and burying
release poisonous fumes such as vinyl
chloride gas. The only answer seems
to be not to use so much plastic in the
first place. However, there are certain
plastics which can be melted down
and recast into heavy duty items such
as floor tiles and fence posts.
It is also possible to produce
biodegradable plastics from natural
substances such as sugar and
carbohydrates, rather than oil. Such
plastics will decompose within a year
on a compost heap. Clearly, careful
thought can ensure the problem of
disposing of plastic is solved, by using
it appropriately.
There are many solutions to the
problems of waste, by careful
selection of materials for packaging,
and by sorting rubbish as it is
discarded. The latest enemy of
environmentally sound waste disposal
are the composite materials which
manufacturers seem to love. These
are impossible to recycle as they
cannot be separated.
Consumer pressure has already
been seen to work in removing
additives from food. The next target
should be the packaging it comes in.
We must demand simpler and
recyclable packaging.
Tropical Rainforests
Tropical forests, commonly known as
Rainforests, are disappearing at an
alarming rate. While it is hard to
monitor exactly how fast they are
being cleared, it is estimated by the
U.S. Department of Energy that 20
million hectares are lost every year.
That's an area the size of England,
Scotland and Wales.
These forests have evolved over
millions of years, and at present cover
6% of the Earth's surface. They are
also the richest biological systems.
More than half of all wild species on
earth live in these Rainforests.
The reasons for the deforestation
mainly lie with the spread of non-
sustainable farming in the developing
world, and with extensive and
THE STATISTICS
• 40% of all tropical forests have disappeared since 1945
• Every year 20 million hectares of tropical forest are destroyed
or irreversibly damaged. That's 100 acres every minute.
• 5 million hectares per year are consumed by commercial logging.
The logging damages the forests so badly that thay cannot be
renewed, and the trees will not grow properly. Tropical loggers
make no attempt to replant felled areas.
• In an area of 4 square miles of Rainforest there are up to 1,500
species of flowering plant, 750 species of tree, 400 species of
butterfly, 125 of mammals, 100 of reptiles, and 50 of amphibians.
• Over 50 different wild species become extinct every day
more than one every half hour!
• 40 years ago, Ethiopia had forests covering 40% of its land,
and a population of 4.5 million. Today trees less than 5%, and the
population has risen to 40 million.
• Globally, over 1 billion people depend on water from tropical
Rainforests to irrigate their crops.
• As a result of deforestation in the Himalayas, India spends over
$1 million annually on river defences to control seasonal flooding.
destructive logging. The countries in
which the rainforests are situated,
such as Brazil, Zaire and Indonesia,
have rapidly growing populations,
and they desperately need wood for
fuel, and land on which to grow
crops.
Where once small groups of
indigenous peoples used traditional
shifting cultivation methods, there are
now huge numbers of landless
migrants, moving into the areas. They
use 'slash and burn' farming, clearing
vast areas of forest to plant crops,
because they do not know how to use
the forests sustainably for food. In
Brazil, the government has embarked
on a forced programme of migration
into the Rainforests.
The second biggest cause of
deforestation is commercial logging.
The forests are either clear-felled or
selectively logged. Clear-felling is
used to produce pulp for the paper
industry, and involves the removal of
everything, leaving the land bare.
Selective logging is used where only
certain species are wanted, typically
for the timber trade. Whilst only 10
- 15% is removed, selective logging
still leaves the forest severely
damaged, and usually, 30 - 60% of
the trees are destroyed.
The logging is encouraged by the
economic situation. Many tropical
countries have growing debts, and are
forced to use their natural resources
to meet the interest repayments. The
demand for consumer goods and
packaging in the developed world
exasperates the situation.
The rapid clearing of Rainforests
provides short-term relief for the
countries containing them. However,
the long term effects can be
disastrous. As most of the nutrients
are contained in the dense vegetation,
clearing the Rainforests leaves the soil
barren. Crops can only be grown for
a few years before the land is
exhausted. This is in direct contrast
to the experience in non-tropical
regions, where land cleared of forest
leaves fertile soil.
Water supplies are seriously
threatened by deforestation. The
tropical Rainforests receive half the
world's rainfall, and soak up the
water, slowly releasing it to the
surrounding areas during the dry
seasons. Clearing the forests removes
this storehouse, and causes alternate
flooding and drought.
Soil erosion is another
consequence. The intense rainstorms
can remove 70 tonnes of soil per acre
in just half an hour. Where once the
soil was protected from this onslaught
by the vegetation, if it is left bare, it
is simply washed away. Rivers silt up
down-stream and cause more flooding
in the coastal regions.
Perhaps the most serious result is
the effect on the global weather. The
loss of Rainforests results in a general
decrease of rainfall in the countries
involved. Worse still, the build-up of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
leads to the 'greenhouse effect',
which it is estimated will raise
temperatures by two to three degrees
over the next fifty years. This is
sufficient to melt the polar caps,
flooding the coastal regions where a
third of the world's population live,
and making the equatorial regions
uninhabitable.
No-one is really sure of the long-
term effects of the loss of the
Rainforests are. At the current rate
there will be very little left by the next
century. The predicted consequences
range from the mildly disastrous to
the total loss of all life on Earth.
