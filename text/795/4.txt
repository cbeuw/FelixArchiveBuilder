financial penalties for non-
compliance. It does not take too much
imagination to see the Government
specifically not allocating any funds
for a Student Union if they felt the
need.
Even without this power, a
University competing to provide
education at the lowest possible price,
to attract funding, will see libraries,
welfare services and Student Unions
as easy targets for savings, as they
have no capacity for gaining funds.
goals open to a privileged few, as set
out in the GERBILL. Education is a
right, not a privilege.
The GERBILL
The Bill is now in the committee
stage, and is due to be presented to
the Commons for the last time in
March. Any amendments need to be
made before around 8 March.
Already the Government have backed
down on some proposals; they have
indicated that they do not intend to
NUS Protest outside Parliament
Imperial College, in the middle of one
of the most expensive areas in the
country, has a clear disadvantage in
these competitions, with the staff
costs and overheads significantly
higher than a competing College
outside London.
What's Missing
We all know that one of the biggest
problems facing students today is the
level of the Grant they receive. This
isn't even mentioned in the Bill. At
the moment the Minister for
Education, Robert Jackson (who was
at Imperial on 15 February and is
featured on the front cover of the
College magazine, Network, this
week), is reviewing student financial
support, as it is known. This review,
it is widely rumoured, is going to
propose the introduction of student
loans. This is despite evidence from
overseas, where the introduction of
loans has resulted in higher costs for
the education system as a whole and
where it has deterred students from
entering higher education.
There is no committment to the
principle of 'education for all', no
concessions to help the disadvantaged
or poor. What we need is a high
quality education system available to
all members of our society, not a
narrow system based on industrial
interfere with the way that the UFC
proposes to distribute funding. This
is mainly due to the Higher Education
lobby in the House of Lords, they do
not rule out, however, the
introduction of contract funding or
other alternatives that will have
similar or worse effects. This does
show, however, that they will bow to
pressure for change if they are forced.
In Conclusion
Although presented as a change in the
way that the Universities are funded,
the GERBILL gives the Secretary of
State for Education (who may well be
Labour in the future—a fact some
senior Tories are very concerned
about) the power to decide, to a very
large degree, exactly where money is
spent and therefore exactly what is
taught, when it is taught and by
whom. This, combined with the
current Government policies for
higher education and the lack of any
more cash, constitutes the greatest
attack on the universities since they
were set up.
The timescale for the GERBILL is
geared towards getting the new
system well established by the next
election, so that a future Government
would not be able to reverse such
major changes so soon. The system
that is set up now will last another ten
or twenty years and it is important to
get it right. Despite this, the
opportunity for consultation and
debate has been tiny. The Bill is into
its third reading, after only being
introduced last summer. The latest
consultation period has been only two
months, where normal bills have
periods of 6 months or more. The
reaction has been so great that even
in this time, over 15,000 replies have
been received.
What can we do about it?
At the Imperial College Union
General Meeting last Tuesday, the
Union voted not to attend the National
Union of Students (NUS) rally in
Central London tomorrow; they felt
a seperate campaign would have more
impact and influence on the
Government. Imperial students are
still welcome on the march, under the
University of London Union banner.
It starts at midday at Embankment
tube, and the rally is afterwards at
3.00pm in Hyde Park.
The Union instead decided to ask
each year group to hold a half day
strike on Tuesday 1 March, from
11.00am to 4.30pm, to coincide with
the AUT lobby of Parliament. The
President and External Affairs Officer
are producing a paper on what exactly
the Bill would mean for Imperial
College, and students are to be
encouraged to lobby their MPs at the
same time.
Individually you can write to
Kenneth Baker or your M P
expressing your opposition to the
proposals, fill in one of the U L U
postcards, and keep your eyes open
for further action.
