On Tuesday March 1st and Tuesday
March 8th, a number of students at
Imperial will be hungerstriking in
solidarity with Soviet refuseniks,
waiting to be permitted to leave
Russia.
The project, called "Hungry for
Freedom", will involve students
fasting from sunrise to sunset in
solidarity with Alex Poberezchensky.
Alex, a 19 year old student, is being
asked to join the Russian military
(which will cause the Russians to
refuse him an exit visa for 20 years
after his service as a result of
"military agreement"—a violation of
the 1975 Helsinki Agreement), or face
imprisonment. Alex needs our moral
support, and the plight of an innocent
fellow student must be known.
The second Tuesday, March 8th
was chosen to coincide with
International Women's Day—a day
on which, in over 50 campuses in
Britain, students will be fasting to
show strength of feeling for another
student refusenik, Galina Pilenstein,
in her struggle for freedom.
Many IC students will hopefully
make the above dates memorable
occasions for Alex, Galina and
Imperial College, by joining the fast.
If you can't quite manage to do
without food for the day, perhaps
sponsor a friend to?
Anyone interested in helping during
the above, or with the Soviet Jewry
Campaign at all, please contact
Jonathan Goldstein (Chem 1).

Parliament is again preparing for
another debate and vote on whether
to reintroduce the death penalty for
murder in the UK. An amendment or
amendments are to be put forward at
the Third Reading of the Criminal
Justice Bill, probably to take place in
April.
Amnesty International opposes the
death penalty in all cases without
reservation and as a matter of
principle. The death penalty is the
ultimate cruel, inhumane and
degrading punishment. It is a denial
of the right to life. There is always
the risk that someone who has been
wrongfully convicted will be
executed. Timothy Evans was hanged
in 1949 for the murder of his daughter
and was awarded a posthumous
pardon in 1966 when the evidence of
the principle witness was discredited.
A recent study in the USA produced
evidence of 349 cases in which
innocent people were wrongly
convicted of capital offences. Twenty-
three of these were unjustifiably
executed. In 1987, during the debate
on the re-introduction of the death
penalty, Douglas Hurd, Home
Secretary, spoke against it saying
that, as it was irrevocable, " A later
finding of innocence would leave a
dark stain on our system of justice."
Please write a letter to your MP
urging him/her to vote against the re-
introduction of the death penalty
giving a list of arguments against it.

Monique Yeo (Maths 2) or Stephen
Curry (int 6729).
O S C - P A R T Y
If you like dancing to the sounds of
the Afro-Caribbean disco, lively
Brazilian Carnival Music, exotic food
and drinks, are interested in
international culture and folk dance,
then hold your breath. The night you
have been waiting for is coming to IC
tomorrow, Saturday 27th Feb, with
only £2.50 a ticket (£3.00 after 9pm).
The night will start at 6pm with a
Cultural Exhibition including
registered societies of IC Union OS
Committee. Later on, International
Exotic Food Tasting and a show of
National Folk Dance Groups will
warm you up for the following
impressive Afro-Caribbean Disco and
Brazilian Carnival. These take place
simultaneously in the SCR and MDH.
During this time, a Late Bar will be
open for drinks until 2 am.
I assure you that it will certainly be
the talking point of IC next week.
There is no need to tell you that it's
a night not to be missed. So, cancel
everything, be there and have the
most enjoyable night of your life at
IC.

W A T E R S K I CLUB
Does the idea of skimming across the
water at speeds of up to and in excess
of 30mph interest you? Maybe you
just like the thought of being dragged
along by a 140hp boat! Whichever,
the Water-ski Club is for you.
The club is currently inactive, but
if enough interest is shown we hope
to restart it. At our disposal is a
14-foot Delta Sports hull powered by
a 140hp Ford 3-litre V6 engine. This
is kept at Burghfield Aqua-sports club
near Reading which offers club
members good skiing at whatever
level of ability. It also provides bar
and kitchen facilities.
If you think that water skiing at this
time of year is only for masochists
you couldn't be more wrong. Wet and
dry suits are available for members'
use at a daily charge of 70p, so you
need never feel the slightest chill.
Apart from a swimming costume (and
wet and dry suits) all necessary
equipment is provided free of charge.
The membership of £10 for full
members or £2 for day members may
sound excessive but the facilities
available to the club are only normally
available at clubs where membership
is in excess of £100. Actually towing
time is also much cheaper at about
20p per minute, and even experienced
skiers don't normally ski for longer
than 15 minutes. So as you can see
the costs are minimal for an
afternoon's exhilaration.
Tuition is available to all members
free of charge, whatever level of
ability you are, so everyone can make
rapid progress. If you are at all
interested in water skiing whether
you're a complete novice or an expert
(especially if you have a car!) please
contact us through the pigeonholes or
meet us above Southside Bar on
Mondays at 12.30. We'll look
forward to seeing you.
