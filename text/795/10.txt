'up yours' interpretation. In most
parts of Europe, however, this palm
facing in version means 'victory'.
This signal also means the number
two. The insulted Spaniard serving
behind a bar could respond by giving
the Brit two pints of beer!
There are many other simpler
gestures which can be misinterpreted
and can cause embarrassing results.
All the gestures I have pointed out are
given the British interpretation.
One of the mistakes that can be
made in understanding body language
is to interpret as a solitary gesture
rather than as part of a cluster.
Scratching the head could mean any
number of things: fleas, dandruff,
uncertainty, forgetfulness or lying.
In addition to looking for gesture
clusters and congruence of speech and
body movement, all gestures should
be considered in the context in which
they occur. For instance, if a person
were huddled at a train station we
could rightly assume that they were
cold. If they struck the same position
in a warm house then we could
interpret this as a defensive position.
Faking
It's no use trying to fake your body
language because you will also,
subconciously, give out microsignals
that you are a faker. The pupils may
contract, one eyebrow may lift or
some part of the body may twitch.
The result is that the receiver tends
not to believe you.
The human mind knows when it is
receiving incongruent non-verbal
messages. However, some people
have got faking off to an art.
Politicians are very good examples.
They are very good at using body
language to persuade people to vote
for them. Successful 'political fakers'
are said to have 'charisma'. Beware
of charismatic sabbatical candidates!
The problem with lying is that the
subconscious mind acts automatically
and independently of our verbal lie.
People who rarely tell lies are easily
caught because during a lie our body
gives out nervous energy that shows
up in our gestures. This is the
principal on which American lie
detectors work. Some people whose
jobs involve lying, such as actors,
politicians, lawyers and sabbaticals
have usually refined their gestures to
the point where it is difficult to detect
the lie.
Research using slow motion
cameras shows that most
microgestures occur within a split
second. It is only people such as
professional interviewers who can
conciously see them during a
conversation.
The best way to lie is over the
telephone!
Zones
Man, like animals, has territories.
Every country is a territory. People
also kill to protect their own territory.
Each person has his own personal
zone which includes the area around
his possessions, such as his home, his
car and his airspace around his body.
(FELIX Editors have their office!)
Most animals have their own
personal space. How far it extends
depends on how crowded the area is.
Man's space depends on the density
of the population in the place where
he grew up. This personal space is,
therefore, culturally determined.
1. Intimate Space (15-46cm) Only
those who are emotionally close to
that person are permitted to enter it.
Between 0 and 15cm is the close
intimate space.
2. Personal Space (46-120cm) This
is the distance that we stand from
others at parties and social gatherings.
3. Social Space (120-360cm) This is
the distance for strangers.
4. Public Space This is the
comfortable distance when we are
addressing a group.
If a person enters our intimate zone,
the heart pumps faster, adrenalin
pours into the bloodstream and blood
is pumped to the brain in preparation
for an attack.
The distance that two people who
are kissing keep their hips apart can
tell you about the relationship
between them. If their pelvises are
within 15cm then they are lovers or
enjoy a close physical relationship. If
the hips are more than 15cm apart
then they no longer enjoy a physical
relationship or never had one in the
beginning!
Crowding
There are certain unwritten rules
which British people follow when
their intimate space is invaded
because of crowding, such as in a
crowded lift or train:
1. You are not permitted to speak to
anyone;
2. You must avoid eye contact with
others;
3. No emotion must be displayed;
4. If you have a newspaper, you must
appear to be deeply engrossed in it;
5. The bigger the crowd, the less the
body movement you are permitted to
make;
6. In lifts, you must watch the floor
numbers as they pass by.
As soon as we enter a crowded
place, the crowd become 'non-
persons'. They do not exist and we,
therefore, do not respond to them.
When a person claims an area
among strangers, such as a seat in a
cinema, he usually looks for the
widest space available between two
others and claims the area in the
centre. The purpose of this is not to
offend the other people by being to
close to them.
An exception to this rule is the
spacing that occurs in public toilet
cubicles. Research shows that people
choose the end toilets about 90% of
the time, and, if they are occupied,
the midway principle is used.
