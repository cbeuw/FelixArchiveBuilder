Welcome to the bigger, better,
brighter FELIX! This issue is full of
great features and my many fan
letters. I urge you to read them. It's
not often that people show such
appreciation of my humble efforts. I
still enjoy reading FELIX anyway.
Does anybody else?
Strike
I think that one of the most sensible
moves that Ian Howgate has made this
year has been to suggest that
individual lecture groups vote to take
action. Having taken part in the last
joint AUT/ICU/NALGO action in
January 1986, which failed due to
lack of student/lecturer support, I can
only applaud next week's method of
action. It is important that we don't
sit back and ignore the Union's call
next Tuesday just because the
Education Reform Bill will benefit
science. The strike has been called to
point out that we, as intelligent
thinkers, do not want the Government
to control what we learn and how we
are to be taught. Nor do we want to
stifle art and all that is creative just
because the Government doesn't
believe it has relevance in the 1990s.
If you do go on strike next
Tuesday, don't just treat it as a day
off. Lobby Parliament or attend the
NUS rally on Saturday. Get off your
backsides and do something radical
for a change!
I also hope that the Union's action
doesn't stop after Tuesday but that
both Ian and Neil Motteram, ICU's
External Affairs Officer, organise
more events to highlight our concern
about GERBILL. I still like the
Rector's idea of staging a work-in.
Strikes are very negative and tend to
aggravate the situation. I'm sure we'd
achieve much greater press coverage
if we did something slightly different
in protest.
Reviews Editor
Charles Robin, who has been our
Reviews Editor this term, has decided
to leave College and has resigned
from his post. This has left the post
vacant. Four people have already
dropped in to the office to ask about
the job. Would they and anybody else
who fancies writing "the occasional
review please drop into the FELIX
Office at 12.45pm today when I will
be holding a special reviewers
meeting.
Manifestos
Next week's FELIX is possibly one
of the most important issues of the
year: the manifestos issue. It will
explain the Union's version of the
Single Transferable Vote System and
contain the manifestos of all the
students standing in the sabbatical
elections. Don't miss it as it's your
Union's future!
For any potential sabbaticals out
there, the deadline for the manifestos
issue is 9.30am on Monday 29th
February. The maximum number of
words for a manifesto is 300; over-
long manifestos will be cut at the
300th word. No manifestos will be
accepted after 9.30am. FELIX will
print copy exactly as it is submitted.
All candidates should ensure that their
spelling, grammar, etc, is correct.
Photographs will be printed with
manifestos if delivered on time.
Heroes
I would like to take this opportunity
to thank all my staff who rallied
around me on Monday and Tuesday
when Rose Atkins, our typesetter,
went down with a mysterious virus
and on Wednesday when the printing
press broke down again. I want also
to thank both Rose and Dean, the
printer, for their dedication. Dean has
been fighting the 'flu all week. It's no
mean feat operating the press with a
full-scale headache. Most printers
would not have bothered but Dean's
a printer in a million!!
Print Unit's Future
Has the Print Unit a future after all
the criticism it's been getting
recently? Certainly when my
sabbatical was created both FELIX's
and the Print Unit's work were a lot
smaller than in 1988. For the past
month we have been holding a
working party to discuss the FELIX
Editor's job description and the future
of the Print Unit. Perhaps it is time
to split the Editor and Print Unit
Manager. We will be having a final
meeting of the working party at 1pm
today in the FELIX Office and
hopefully come up with a few
decisions. Anybody who feels that
they can suggest anything useful to
this party is welcome to attend—and
that includes any of my fans in
Mopsoc or Astrosoc.
More Staff
FELIX can never have too many
staff. The more input there is, the
better the paper. The easiest ways to
contribute are by either writing a
feature on something you care
passionately about or by turning up
on Thursday nights to collate the
paper (that's putting the sheets
together). Collation was how I got
involved but I'm a bit sick of it now.
I don't think I'm a dictator, as is
suggested on the letters page, just a
bit eccentric. Don't be surprised if
you find me hang gliding off the
folding machine.
