STRIKE!
The first strike by IC students since 1986 looks set to go ahead on
Tuesday March 1, following a successful motion to this effect at last
Tuesday's Extraordinary General Meeting. The motion, proposed by
ICU External Affairs Officer, Neil Motteram, called for student
support for the AUT (Association of University Teachers) and TUC
lobby of Parliament in opposition to the Government's Education
Reform Bill (GERBILL).
Ballots are currently underway on a
departmental year basis, on the
understanding that a class majority
will result in the cancellation of all
their lectures, labs and tutorials from
Engineering 2 & 3 and Computing 2
are in favour of taking strike action
on Tuesday. Only Mechanical
Engineering 2 and MRE 3 have
decided not to strike and both MRE
External Affairs Officer Neil Motteram co-ordinating the GERBIL challenge
11am to 4.30pm. In this way AUT
members will be free to attend the
protest, which ICU students are also
being asked to support. By yesterday
afternoon 18 lecture classes had been
polled. Life Sciences 1 & 2,
Biotechnology 3, Mathematics 1,
Chemistry 1 & 2, Physics 1 & 2, Civil
Engineering 1, Aeronautical
Engineering 1 & 2, Chemical
1 and Geology 1 have delayed making
a decision until they receive more
information on what they are
supposed to be striking about.
The last time that ICU protested
against Government education policy
was in January 1986, when the Union
supported the AUT on its stance
against cuts in higher education
funding. Although the AUT received
national press coverage on this
occasion, the ICU strike was not well
supported, and it is hoped that the
departmental voting will encourage
student support.
ICU voted in favour of this
independent action rather than take
part in the NUS/TUC rally in Hyde
Park tomorrow (Saturday). Mr
Motteram, who was recently no-
confidenced and then re-elected as
External Affairs Officer, believes
such a stance is important as Imperial
College has much to gain from the
Bill: in particular through the change
in emphasis from arts and humanities
to science and engineering the
proposed University Funding Council
(UFC) will create. He considers the
increased powers of the Secretary of
State to be of particular concern,
along with the power of the UFC to
specify exactly how funds are spent.
NUS rally
The National Union of Students is
holding a national demonstration
supported by the Trades Union
Congress against the Education
Reform Bill tomorrow. Students are
asked to assemble on the
Embankment at 12 noon and march
to Hyde Park for 3pm where there
will be a rally. Imperial College
students have been invited to attend
even though Imperial College Union
will not be sending a formal
delegation.
