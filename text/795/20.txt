Rag ruffled by glossy mag
Imperial College Rag are up in arms
over a new rag mag which is being
sold throughout London. The rag
mag, which looks like a glossy
magazine and is printed in full colour,
is being sold for £1 a copy. The mag
has been produced and distributed by
a group calling themselves London
Rag Chairman Nigel Baker first
heard of the group last Thursday
when he was trying to sell Imperial
College rag mags in the Goose and
Firkin pub. Nobody was willing to
buy them because they had already
been sold a London rag mag earlier
in the evening. Mr Baker became j
suspicious of the rag mag because he
had never heard of a London wide
charity fund raising organisation and
the telephone numbers given in the
magazine were unobtainable.
The next day the magazines were
being sold outside Beit Quadrangle.
Mr Baker decided to contact the
charity named by London Rag 88,
Intermediate Technology, which is an
organisation trying to help the Third
World to help itself. The Appeals
Organiser knew of the mag but did
not know about the group behind it.
Mr Baker also rang several of the
advertisers to point out that Imperial
Rag, the largest rag in London, was
not connected with the venture.
On Wednesday Mr Baker was
threatened with an injunction by
London Rag 88 in order to stop him
telephoning the advertisers or the
press. They claim that advertising
worth £4000 may be lost already due
to Mr Baker's action.
Mr Baker told FELIX last night that
he believed a London wide rag was
The offending rag magazine
a good idea but that this group had
gone about it the wrong way. They
were paying people to sell the rag mag
and the public were buying it because
they thought that it was a glossy
student rag mag and all the money
was going to charity. He also doesn't
believe that rag should be politicised:
the magazine contains an article about
the Green Party and several adverts
for political campaigns. He has asked
London Rag to place an insert in each
magazine pointing out that they are
not connected with any College rags.
He feels their efforts will jeopardise
any sponsorship or advertising that IC
Rag tries to obtain in the future.
A meeting has been organised
between London Rag 88 and all
London College rags for next
Monday, when Mr Baker hopes that
the whole situation will be sorted out.
