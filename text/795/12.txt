FOOTBALL
We return once more unto the league
trail with a couple of London derbys
to offer the decerning neutral, but
with little else in what looks like a
barren Saturday. My predictions were
mostly up the spout last week, mainly
in the lower divisions, though. All
matches are on Saturday 27 February
at 3.00pm.
Arsenal Vs Charlton
(Highbury—Arsenal tube)
A London derby to kick off which
throws together two contrasting teams
with 21 points separating them.
Arsenal came through a tricky FA
Cup tie last week against Man Utd,
due to the fact that Mr McClair
though he was taking a Rugby
penalty. Paul Davis is due back for
Arsenal and they look a strong outfit
now. Charlton had a great victory last
week, their first this year, and only
their 5th league win all season. They
are off the bottom, but their is a long
way to go yet if they are to survive.
Garth Crooks is back in form and
could cause Arsenal a few problems,
but an Arsenal win seems the sensible
result to expect.
QPR Vs Wimbledon
(Loftus Rd—White City Tube)
Yet another game between two near
neighbours (a pity Charlene won't be
in it!) in London. Rangers drew in the
Cup last week (replay two days ago)
and still in the top six of the division
with a strong home record to boast.
The Dons are seventh and after a
tremendous victory last week, helped
by Vinny 'Grab Your Nuts' Jones,
over Newcasde in the Cup, they must
be confident of a good result here.
Wimbledon were my tip for the cup
at the beginning of the season, and
have not let me down at all. (A pity
I didn't put my money where my
mouth was). Predicting a result is not
so easy here, so I will plump for a
hard fought draw.'
Leyton Orient Vs Wrexham
(Brisbane Rd—Leyton Tube)
Orient had a boosting 4-1 win against
fellow promotion chasers Cardiff last
week, after being 1-0 down as well.
They are right back in the hunt and
Frank Clark must be a little happier
now. Wrexham sit at the wrong end
of the league table and their away
record seems to explain why, with
only 10 goals to show from 15
outings. The O's should come out on
top with a comfortable win.
Game of the Day:
QPR Vs Wimbledon
Crystal Palace Vs Shrewsbury
(Selhurt Park—Norwood Junction
BR)
Palace have a brilliant home record
with twelve victories already. They
are still in the promotion race but have
slipped behind mainly due to the
brilliance of Blackburn, and the
dogger determination of Aston Villa.
Their rhyming strickers Bright and
Wright have 40 goals between them
now. Shrewsbury languish 4th bottom
of the league and have a bad away
record with a lack of goals. They have
former Villa and Blues player David
Geddis still in the area and Bernard
McNally to bang home the ball from
the spot. If Palace play to their
potential they should win quite easily,
if they play badly I still can't see
Shrewsbury getting even a point.
Fulham Vs Blackpool
(Craven Cottage—Putney Bridge
Tube)
Fulham splashed egg on my face last
week by beating Walsall 2-0 with
Leroy Rosenior netting one for a
change. Their crowd was dismal,
surely well below a break-even level.
It lifted them up the league to a
deceptively comfortable mid-table
position. Blackpool were unlucky not
to reach the 5th round of the cup, a
last minute Man City goal robbing
them.
They are one point and one position
below Fulham (3 games in hand).
They have ex-Sunderland and Stoke
man Barry Siddall inbetween the
sticks and ex-Throstle Craig Madden
up front. A draw is the most likely
betweeen two indifferent sides.
My Littlewoods Cup Final
prediction:
Arsenal Vs Oxford
MUSIC
First on the agenda this week is the
musical extravaganza which is the
Jazz and Rock Club Hop. All the
Rock and Pop bands within College
will be showing their respective
talents. Headlining are the popular
Schroedinger's Cat playing very
professional folk-rock. Just as
competant are The Gents, who do a
lively Rock V Roll set, and Contact
Point who play hard rock. Maybe I
don't like heavy rock, but the mighty
Curmudgeon are pretty damn good
and have a few surprises up their
sleeves. I can't exactly give a totally
unbiased view of the Mock Ducks,
seeing as how I'm one of them, but
we have jokingly been described as
"the best thing since Sigue Sigue
Sputnick" (thanks Tom). Oh well, it's
all a bit of fun.
If by now you are thinking "Oh no,
another I.C. Rock Night", well think
again. The lovable Chance bring you
lively pop and HiNRG, and probably
a fashion show as well! All this and
more in the Lower Union Lounge on
Saturday night.
Out in the big wide world, the crazy
Butthole Surfers play their unique
brand of garage to a strong following
at ULU tonight. If you want to see
the Mighty Lemon Drops at the
Astoria either tonight or tomorrow,
go early as they will sell out rapidly.
I don't know about you, but I've
always found it a waste of time seeing
them live and I got nothing I couldn't
get from listening from the Album
'Tonight'.
Gig Review
All About Eve at Manchester
International 2
Apologies for missing The Wedding
Present—they'd sold out. I've always
found All About Eve rather dull on
record, consequently I knew next to
nothing about them. I only went along
because I was stuck in Manchester on
my own with nothing to do until I ran
into a couple of Goths who said they
were going, would I join them? I'm
glad I did. The support band,
Something Else played a mixture of
Doors and Kinks covers and their own
material which sounded much the
same; good but forgettable. All About
Eve came on, all but hidden by a sea
of hands outstretched above crimped
hair, and began to demonstrate why
they are the focus of such devotion.
They played brilliantly, giving a
superb rendition of the album bearing
the groups name, plus a few
surprises—'Paradise' being the most
memorable. The singer's vocal
excellence makes her a serious rival
to Kate Bush. This band do not fit into
any major musical catagory, but are
probably nearest to Pop-Goth. But
who cares? The worshipping fans
showed their deafening appreciation
which should elevate them to the
dizzy heights reached by The Cure.
See them next week at the Astoria!

RACING
All you eagle-eyed punters who
spotted the misprint—my fault, not
FELIX—in last week's racing
selections probably wished you'd
have kept your eyes shut.
I picked Slalom to win the 1.30 at
Chepstow but put down Friday
instead of Saturday. As it happened,
when Michael Robinson's horse did
run the next day, he came a
dissappointing third to Sir Blake by
some three and three-quarter lengths.
There was no way that Slalom could
give any more after being hampered
by Sir Blake and second-placed Rusde
on the home straight. After a stewards
enquiry, the result stood. If you blew
some of your hard earned grant on
Slalom, spare a thought for the punter
who laid £5OOO-£55O0 on him at
Chepstow!
My other blunder of last weekend,
excluding the now-familiar non-
runners, was backing the Maid of
Money tip win at Navan on Saturday.
She just missed out when beaten by
a length and a half from Galmoy.
Punters who took her each way aK>-l
deserve a pat on the back.
Playschool could well enter the
Cheltenham Gold Cup on March 17th
at evens, 6-4 at the most. Ante-post
backers might be as well to take 4-1
being offered by all the High Street
bookies. This is looking more
attractive day by day with Burrough
Hill Lad and Cavvies Clown still
looking doubtful. In the Daily
Express Triumph Hurdle on the same
day, Young Snugfit is still looking a
good each way prospect at 25-1. The
price can only go down. My advice
is to move quick on that one.
A spy of mine with contacts at
David Elswoth's stable informs me of
a cert running at Cheltenham in
March. I'm so confident on him that
I'll be risking a pony each way on the
nag in question—but fear not! FELIX
readers will not go uninformed.
Watch this space nearer the Festival
for details.

week's selections.
