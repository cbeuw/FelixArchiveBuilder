Crossed Arms and Legs
This gesture is a signal that a negative
or defensive attitude exists, crossing
the arms on the chest was originally
intended to defend the heart and
breasts. Crossing the legs is an
attempt to shield the genitals.
Leg Clamping
A person who adopts a Figure 4
position with the right leg resting on
the left knee with the hands clamped
on the right shin is showing that he
is a tough-minded, stubborn
individual.
Palms
The open palm has been associated
with truth, honesty and submission.
Oaths are taken with palm on the heart
or held visibly in the air as in a court
of law. One way of discovering
whether someone is being honest is
to look for palm displays.
Eye Rubbing
This gesture is the brain's attempt to
block out the deceit, doubt or lie that
it sees, or to avoid having to look at
the face of the person to whom he is
telling the lie.
Fingers in the Mouth
This occurs usually when the person
is under pressure. It is an unconcious
attempt to revert to the security of the
child sucking on his mother's breast.
This gesture is an outward
manifestation of an inner need for
reassurance.
Cheek and Chin
A good personal tutor knows when
his students are interested in the
tutorial. When the student begins to
use his hand to support his head, it
is a signal that boredom has set in.
The degree of boredom is related to
the extent to which his arm and hand
are supporting. The ultimate boredom
signal is when the head is on the table
and the person is snoring!
Evaluation is shown by a closed
hand resting on the cheek, often with
I P
the index finger pointing upwards.
Should the person begin to lose
interest but wish to appear interested,
the position will alter slightly so that
the heel of the palm supports the head.
Genuine interest is shown when the
hand is on the cheek, not used as a
head support.
The chin-stroking gesture is the
signal that the listener is making a
decision.
Hands Behind Head
This gesture is used by a 'know it all'
individual and many people find it
irritating when someone does it to
them. It is typical of professional
people or people who are feeling
confident or dominant.
Hands on Hips
This indicates an aggressive attitude.
Humans use this gesture to make
themselves appear bigger. Males will
use it as a non-verbal challenge to
other males who enter their territory.
It can also be interpreted as a 'ready-
for-action' gesture.
The aggressive-readiness poses are
used by professional models to give
the impression that their clothing is
for the modern, forward-thinking
woman.
Sexual Aggressiveness
Thumbs tucked into the tops of the
pockets is an act of sexual
aggressiveness. The hands highlight
the genital region. Men use this
gesture to stake their territory or in
the presence of females to say 'I'm
virile and I can dominate you'.
This gesture, combined with
expanded pupils and one foot pointing
towards a female, can be easily
decoded by most women. Women
who prefer wearing trousers are
usually those who are sexually
agressive and like to make decisions.
Hence the old saying: 'the one who
wears the trousers' in a household.
Playing with Purple Fluff
This usually indicates an insecurity or
an intent to stop biting the nails. Most
people find this habit intensely
irritating.
Eyes
Eye contact is probably the most
important sort of non-verbal
communication because eyes are a
focal point of the body and the pupils
work independently.
The pupils will dilate or contract as
the person's attitude and mood change
from positive to negative and vice

versa. When someone becomes
excited, his pupils can dilate up to
four times their normal size. An angry
mood can cause the pupils to contract.
Young lovers will look into each
other's eyes, unknowingly looking for
dilation. Pornographic images cause
pupils to dilate by three times their
normal amount.
Tests conducted recently showed
that expert card players played less
well if their opponents wore dark
glasses. Scientists put this down to the
fact that the opponent's eyes would
dilate if they had a good hand so the
expert would know that he shouldn't
bet on the hand.
Territorial Gestures
People lean against other people or
objects to show a territorial claim.
Leaning can also be used as a method
of dominance or intimidation when
the object being leaned on belongs to
someone else.
Conclusion
People form 90% of their opinion
about you in the first 90 seconds of
meeting you, and you never get a
second chance to make a first
impression! So, you better get
practising your gestures now , before
you turn too many people off!
