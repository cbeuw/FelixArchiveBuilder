Nam Pai Chuan
On the 16th May, a small but
dedicated group of practitioners of
Nam Pai Chuan kung fu left the
bounds of South Kensington for the
outlands of Fulham. Their purpose
- to test their skill and courage at
the West London open Martial Arts
tournament (semi contact).
The day opened with the Form
competition. A form is a sequence
of set moves, practiced in order to
perfect technique and coordination.
The majority of competitors were
from Karate schools, and due to
their complexity and flowing nature
the Kung Fu forms seemed out of
place compared to the Karate style's
more direct nature. However, one
of our black belts still achieved 5th
place in this contest.
After this were the sparring
competitions, with four categories
Juniors, Womens, Mens (coloured
belts), Mens (seniors). Our only
female entrant, Margaret, had a
considerable task in the first round
when taking on last year's reigning
champion. Again the differences in
style became apparent as Margaret
initially had difficulty scoring points
in a Karate style competition.
However she soon gained control
and achieved a convincing victory.
Having found her footing with the
rules and style she managed to
achieve a silver trophy in this, her
first ever sparring competition.
We gained a considerable success
in the men's (coloured belts)
competition, with all of our
competitors going through to the
first round, including a white belt.
Both Gus Fox (Mech Eng) and Paul
got through to the semi finals, and
managed to win these. This left the
final as a fight between two of our
club members, reminiscent of our
Sunday morning sparring classes.
Paul won the fight and the gold
trophy, Gus achieving silver.
Success was not so great in the
senior's competition, with our only
competitor out in the 2nd round.
Our success overall was highlighted
in the juniors competition, with two
yellow belts from another Nam Pai
Chuan society reaching the semi
final, even though they were
competing against black belts. They
gained silver and bronze medals.
Unfortunately, due to injury we
were only able to field 4
competitors for a five man team in
the team event. We won two out of
the first three fights, with Gus Fox,
a blue belt, defeating a Karate black
belt. In what was for us the deciding
round, the opposition fighter was
forced to retire due to a previous
injury, so the fight was forfeited,
and we were unable to continue.
The match was awarded to the other
team.
All in all, this was a very
successful day for our competitors
adds proved to be a great
experience, with us securing one
bronze, three silver and a gold
medal.
The Tenpin Bowling Club has
enjoyed a very satisfying year, with
more than a fair share of trophies
in our bag and several club records
demolished and re-written. More
importantly, we have finally arrived
at the pinnacle of student bowling
and are looking forward to better
things to come.
Undoubtedly the highest
achievement of the year was
emerging runner-up at the UCTBA
(Universities and Colleges Tenpin
Bowling Association)
Championship. Our previous best
performance was making it to the
quarter finals last year only to put
up a poor showing against
Nottingham. This year, as 2nd
highest pinfall qualifiers, we put
Southampton in their place to meet
Birmingham in the semi-finals.
What an appropriate time to bowl
a record team score of 7629, an
average per bowler of 159!
Unfortunately we were unable to
repeat that performance against the
formidable Leeds in the grand final,
and had to settle for second place.
No one complained because we also
Bottom
walked away with highest B-Team
and C—team game trophies, and the
memory of an unforgettable 268 by
Phil West.
We have also been well
represented in the various student
tournaments, only failing to send a
team to Liverpool Quads, which
some may argue was a tactical
decision. Our players have again
performed commendably, ensuring
entry fees were not spent in vain.
We started the season falteringly,
managing only a mediocre showing
in both the U A U one-day
championship and Notts Doubles.
The next tournament on the
calendar was our very own Imperial
Trios, staged at Hollywood Bowl
Tottenham. We fielded 4 teams,
with 1 team narrowly missing the
cut by 1 pin. Human error on our
part resulted in 3 trophies going into
the wrong hands, including those of
our skipper Pete Sharpe, who had
;o hand his back with much
unwillingness.
Aston Doubles proved to be a
good tournament, with Melvin
Curran and Phil West clinching 2nd

Boating
So far this has been an excellent
year for the Boardsailing Club. We
began the year with the largest
influx of new members ever
recorded. The majority of these
were beginners and it has been great
to watch most of them progress,
from falling in every 30 seconds to
competent sailors, capable of safely
sailing around the reservoir.
Initially Wednesday afternoons
were heavily over-subscribed as
expected, and surprisingly the
numbers have not dropped until
very recently. Although our
membership at Queen Mary
Reservoir has now expired we are
still meeting Tuesday lunchtime in
Southside and we have several
events still to come.
We have been on several
weekend trips to the coast including
exotic locations like Gosport,
Gower (Wales) and Brightlingsea.
At Brightiingsea we met with Essex
Uni but unfortunately the wind did
not permit any serious racing so we
were forced to relax and enjoy the
sun. Nearly everyone managed to
jump off the waves, sometimes you
didn't get much choice! Amazingly
unlike the rest of the year we didn't
even break any kit. (A trip, all for
review
charity!)
James Slaughter is completing his
first season, sailing in the British
Funboard Association Race Series
at events all over the country. He
has achieved some very respectable
results and we hope he will continue
his success.
On 15-16th May we took part in
the first Bic Student Windsurfing
Championships at Clacton-on-Sea.
Our dynamic team of ten left
college on the Friday evening. The
journey was long and uneventful,
apart from the dodgems with the
bus in South Kensington and the
experience with the new roundabout
in Colchester. In an effort to reduce
the cost we had booked a six berth
caravan for ten, a really cunning
idea never to be repeated.
On the Saturday morning we
woke at 8.00am to find perfect
conditions, high onshore winds and
sunshine!! For the first time ever we
were on the beach at 9.00am and it
wasn't long before we had rigged
our sails. The small waves provided
some testing, but exciting sailing
(fortunately the Rescue boat was on
hand to help those in need). By this
time the other teams had started to
Felix 968
arrive and approximately eighty
sailors had made the effort to get out
of bed, forget looming exams and
get on the beach. The racing took
the form of a figure of eight slalom
course around two buoys, starting
and finishing on the beach. Forty
sailors from twelve different
Universities entered the racing. It
was very competitive and exciting
(even for the beginners who
couldn't race because the wind was
too strong). As night fell we retired
to McDonalds and then the bar to
discuss the day's results and more
importantly our tactics—win at all
costs!
Sunday arrived blowing and
sunny again...perfect! (Maybe
Alaric's absence had an effect on
the weather.) The racing continued
with the same format, as did our
success. Everyone managed to
improve on their Saturday
performance and our overall team
position was looking very
promising. In the last final Imperial
took 4th, 5th and 6th place, very
impressive results considering the
tough opposition. By keeping the
races short and continuous we had
completed over thirty races in the
28 May 1993
weekend. The individual event was
won by a local from Essex Uni, but
Dan Laurijssen and James Slaughter
took third and fourth place
respectively. In the team event we
thought we had done enough to take
the title, however we overlooked
the team from Cambridge and we
had to settle for second place. After
visiting McDonald's again to stock
up on junk food we headed home.
It was an excellent weekend, we
came second, got drunk and
sunburnt and we didn't break much
kit. (Our thanks must go to Roger
Lightfoot from Guy's Hospital for
organising the event, we look
forward to next year. Hopefully the
weather will allow beginners to
race.)
Looking to the future we have the
Hayling Island Marathon on
12-13th June, and another trip is
being organised for the last week of
term. Anyone who is interested in
sailing (any standard welcome)
including students at St Mary's
meet us on any Tuesday, 1.00pm in
Southside Upper Lounge or contact

backtracking: Bowling
It was another tale of missed
opportunity when our team came
4th again at Birmingham Sixes. Lee
Brockless, Sam Chen, Dave
Wilkins and Melvin Curran shot
averages of 173, 171, 170 and 169
respectively, a laudable team effort
despite testing conditions.
Our latest outing was to the
distant Hull Trios. Lack of sleep
took its toll on many of our players
who never quite recovered on the
lanes. Sam Chen amazed us by
bowling a 223 and his team did in
fact qualify for the 2nd round, only
to wilt in the limelight. Next year
we are considering chartering a
plane to get us there.
With the daunting 12 hour Leeds
Marathon and new Novices
Tournament still to come, we may
yet witness more heroics.
On the domestic front, the
Internal Trios League saw the top
place within reach of 3 or 4 teams.
After a hard-fought final week,
Wibble emerged champs, 2nd place
went to Hedgehog II and Swan
Vesta took 3rd. The Turkeys
managed a meagre 5th despite
place, Sarah McCarthy and Richard
Stockley missing the stepladder
final by a familiar solitary pin, and
other couples playing well.
Southampton Singles again saw
inspired play by our brood. Siang-
Yong Lim, Pete Sharpe and Matt
Bell produced a high standard of
play and Lim eventually settled for
3rd place while Sharpe collected a
trophy for high handicapped game,
this time for keeps.
The Popular Brunei Doubles held
at the Airport Bowl was a
disappointing tournament, with a
field of strong opposition and an
average effort from our lot denying
us qualifications for the 2nd round.
Two teams were dispatched for
Sheffield Quads and a
miscalculation on a key person's
part meant we almost missed the
roll-off. Fortunately all wasn't lost
and Andy Glading went on to bowl
a remarkable game (229) and series
to earn himself 2 trophies. Dave
Wilkins, one-fourth of the team that
came overall 4th, also bagged the
runner-up trophy in the singles
section.
amassing highest pinfall and 2
scratch trophies. They were
overtaken by the Flaming Carrots
who put in a strong finish.
The Spring Doubles again
featured Matt Bell and Haff A l -
Qassab, them of the Wibble fame,
pitted against newcomers Roger
Chalfont and Kwai Lee in the finals.
Experience on the part of Bell and
Al-Qassab helped to seal their
victory.
The quest for club champion took
the form of the Singles
Championship. After 2 sittings,
Pete Sharpe, Phil West, Sam Chen
and Richard Waring met in the
round-robin final. Immense staying
power finally put 'rubbish skip'
Sharpe on the winners' podium with
11.35 points. Runner-up with 8.67
was Chen and West took 3rd place
with 7.22 points. The inter-CCU
challenge promised to be the grand
finale of the term. RCS have been
knocking on C&Gs door for the last
few years without great success.
While RSM could never quite find
a winning team due to sheer lack of
numbers. The encounter wasn't as
close as expected, and C & G get to
have their name engraved on the
plaque yet again.
The Annual Sponsored Bowl was
one of the social activities held this
year with much success. Fun was
had by all, especially those in fancy
dress (Hi Fred) and all funds raised
go towards cancer research. We
have also initiated the Phil Wren
Memorial Trophy in memory of a
dearly departed team-mate, and
won it (thank goodness) playing
against our guest Brunei University.
Many will remember the Christmas
Bowl as a rare chance to be silly on
the lanes, and it was a real treat to
see everyone in smart garb for the
Christmas Dinner. If only we could
behave ourselves till after pudding
was served.
The Club has gone from strength
to strength, and we hope to better
our achievements come next
season. If there are any budding
bowlers out there who'd like a slice
of the action, contact Rachael Tay
(captain) on in 6018 or via
Materials PG pigeonholes.
