Manifesto
Deputy President (clubs and societies) Charles Leary proposed by Graeme Hey
The restructuring of the Union
allows this post to concentrate far
more on assisting the running and
organisation of the clubs and
societies. I have worked with the
Social, Cultural and Amusement
Board, and specifically the Jazz &
Rock club for two years. During
this time I gave the club what it
wanted as far as was possible.
Communication between societies
and the sabbaticals is essential for
this to happen. Problems arise in the
day to day running of a club, or the
organisation of an event. Often the
combined efforts of the organisers
and the Union is needed before
these problems can be solved.
If you want:
-better run clubs and societies
-more opportunity for clubs and
societies to play a better role in the
entertainments offered by this
college
-to take part in events you want
to put on
-if you want the student put first
vote Charles Leary for Deputy
President (clubs and societies)
Charles Leary.

New Election Dominic 'Lardy Lard Lard'
'Their neither use nor bloody
ornament are sabbaticals.'
So say the Brotherhood of Man
and they should know what their
talking about because they won the
Eurovision Song Contest donkeys
years ago, which is more than can
be said for Sonia. Mind you Cliff
Richard won one year and he's still
famous isn't he and he still manages
to have a hit every Christmas,
which is more than can be said for
Sandie Shaw. She only won because
she had no shoes on and all the
judges took pity on her because they
all thought she was poor and
couldn't afford any. Cheryl Baker
from Bucks Fizz is still on the telly
though isn't she, presenting Record
Breakers. She's perky isn't she, and
Roy Castle, he's in the pink again
isn't he?
Pinky and Perky, where are they
now? Dead most likely, because
Gerbils don't live forever do they?
Diamonds are forever though
aren't they?
Well that's what Sherlie Bassey
sang.
Diamonds are a girls best friend
as well.
Sabbaticals aren't forever and
they're not a girls best friend.
I should know.
Where's me lard?
