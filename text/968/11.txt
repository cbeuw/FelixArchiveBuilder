IC Dance Club looks back at the success of the dance teams in three
national competitions which took place last term.
This academic year has turned out
to be a truly remarkable one for the
IC dance teams. By wirrning every
single team and Offbeats contests in
all the three inter-varsity
competitions which the teams took
part in this year, they have
accomplished a feat which had
never occurred before.
Each team consists of four
couples who dance one of the
following dances—Waltz,
Quickstep, Cha Cha and Jive and
our dance club has four such teams
(A, B , C and D). The team
competition consists of four
seperate knock-out competitions for
each type of dance. The couples,
irrespective of the teams, compete
together along with other
competitors. The points earned by
the couples in the competitions are
then added to give the total score for
each team. The scores are
compared and the highest scoring
A, B and C teams will be the
winners.
All the teams participated-inteh
first competition organised by
Sheffield University. It took place
on 30th January with 25 competing
U K universities. The competition
began with several open
competitions where some excellent
individual performances were
displayed. Our teams evidently had
no shortage of talent to dazzle the
competitors. Both the Vienese
Waltz and Tango opens were won
by IC ballroom dancers and three
IC Latin couples reached the final
of the Samba open.
The much awaited team
competitions began later on with an
impressive team-walk-on which
afterwards ended in a friendly
cheering match.. Of course it was to
our advantage that 'IC' rhymed
rather better than our main rivals
'Oxford' and 'Cambridge'.
Like any other contests, the team
competitions were a very heated
affair. Although the individual skills
and performance were important,
the team members had to support
each other to do well as a group.
So, warm encouragement was
freely exchanged and everyone
practically went mad for their side
competing on the floor.
Understandably, it seemed every
university wanted to out-do their
opponents in supporting their
members. As a result, unbelievable
excitement filled the entire hall
which was resonating with cries of
support for their colleagues.
Afterwards, while the results
were being sorted out, an
additional, knockout competition
was arranged. Two universities
competed against each other in
dances chosen by a draw and the
winner between them competed
with another winner and so, on. The
openent IC faced inthe final was
Oxford who had beaten Cambridge
inthe semi-final. But even they
proved to be no match for IC as
they were clearly overpowered by
our jive and quickstep team
couples.
The announcement of the final
results brought instant delight to
everyone as IC won all A , B and
C team competitions. No university
had won all three tides there before.
The second competition, the
Southern Ball, hosted by Bristol
University took place in the Winter
Garden Pavilion, Western-Super-
Mare on St Valentine's Day. Only
A, B and C teams were allowed to
compete against 21 participating
universities but everyone performed
magnificently in both open and team
competitions.
IC had once again dominated the
opens, by winning both Vienese
Waltz and Rhumba. In the team
competitions, most of the IC
dancers reached the final and the
first place in the Waltz, Cha Cha
and Quickstep was won by our team
members. The overall results again
brought victories to all our
competing teams. It wasn't without
drama either. In the quickstep semi-
final, one IC couple unintentionally
tripped and fell, one of them badly
scratching her foot. But they fought
back bravely and deservingly
snatched the first place in the final.
The extra competition which took
place this time was the Off-Beat.
The Off-Beat is danced by a group
of dancers who synchronise their
sequence of actions with the music.
There were only three entrants-
Imperial, Cambridge and Bath, but
shaking off their flimsy challenges,
Imperial with the dance 'Lyndy
Hop' took the trophy with
unmistakably best performance.
Aboard the coach home, there
was also another occasion to

celebrate. At midnight, a sudden
appearance of a birthday cake with
loud singing surprised the team's
Latin trainer, Vicki. It was also a
fine chance to congratulate her
along with Dorothy, the other
trainer, the good results without
whom our teams would have lacked
the skill and enthusiasm to achieve.
With such successes behind the
teams they faced, with mounting
pressure, one more hurdle. The last
competition for this academic year
was the Inter-Varsity Ball,
celebrating its 30th anniversary. It
was to take place at home, in
London, hosted by no one else but
Imperial College.
The IC teams had won this
competition for the last two
previous years and with such
impressive records, it was of
paramount importance that the
teams repeated their wirining forms.
It took place in the Grosvenor Hotel
at Park Lane on 7th March. Only
A and B teams competed but all
other members including many ex-
members turned up to cheer the host
teams with all they could give.
The final results were more than
anyone had dreamed. Not only did
IC retain the title but also almost
every couple came first in their

respective dances.
However, the Off-Beat contest,
the final event of the night, was a
much closer affair. This time there
were six entrants altogether and the
most dangerous challenge came
from none other than Manchester
University with the dance,
'Madness'. Indeed, it could have
been madness to deny the Imperial
College dance team with the win
and its fantastic unbroken series of
victories.
Many congratulations go to the
team trainers Vicki Cunniffe and
Dorothy Charlton and of course to
every team member whose
dedication and hard work brought
such marvellous results which our
competitors would die for. The club
would also like to thank the Union
and everyone who had helped and
supported the teams throughout.
