At Rag's last meeting, elections
were reheld for next year's
nominated charities, and I am now
at liberty to divulge the results - the
successful applicants were Mencap,
BIBIC, Turning Point, Bliss and'
local charities. Having two smallish
charities, and two larger ones, it
may be that there are some of you
who don't know where the money
from next year's Beer Festival,
Hypnosis, Hit squad etc, will be
going. So here, just for you, is a
quick rundown on where your hard-
earned cash disappears. M y
apologies if this is a bit hard-going,
but I have tried to use the charities'
own words...
Mencap
Over one million people in the UK
have some form of learning
disability (aka mental handicap).
Mencap is committed to providing
high quality services, advice and
support, enabling people with
learning disabilities to make a
positive contribution to the
community, and to make the most
of life. Sounds very worthy, doesn't
it? But what do they actually do?
Mencap provides over 400 homes
for people with learning disabilities;
has set up an employment service
to overcome prejudice, ignorance
and fear; and on top of all this,
offers training at three residential
colleges.
BIBIC
Full name British Institute for Brain
Injured Children, BIBIC is
dedicated to (as you may have
guessed) helping children with
brain-injuries to improve their lives.
The most severe brain-injury is
probably 'profound coma', whilst
the least is probably in children with
mild reading and learning
difficulties. On acceptance onto the
programme, each child's abilities
are assessed in the areas of vision,
hearing, understanding, touch,
mobility, speech and manual
competence. Using a combination
of techniques, BIBIC manages such
feats as teaching children, unable to
do more than creep on their tummy,
to walk, talk and read. Listed under
'victories' in Bibic's quarterly
newsletter, I found such moving
stories as that of Alan Dimmock -
77 months on a Bibic programme
has taught him to walk and talk,

Wanna collect at Johnny Mathis or
Victoria Wood? Gonna be around
in September? Or have you finished
your exams, closed that revision file
for the last time, and want
something to take your mind off that
long wait for the results? Then read
on...
The Spastics Society has got
licences to collect at the Albert Hall
for both Johnny Mathis (14 - 16
September) and Victoria Wood (21
- 26 Sept, inclusive), with free entry
to see the show. Plus, a little closer,
they are holding their City Street
Flag Day on Thursday June 17th,
and would appreciate any can-
ratders that are exam-free and can
spare a few minutes for a good
cause.
Just so as you know, the Spastics
Society is an organisation whose
primary concern is to serve and
promote the interests of people with
cerebral palsy, which is a disabling
condition of impaired muscle-
coordination caused before or at
birth, or in the early years of
childhood by damage to, or
maldevelopment in, the portion of
the brain which controls movement
and posture. (That may be a bit
wordy, but don't blame me, it's
their terminology!).
If you want to collect either at the
Flag Day, or at one of the shows
in September, then pop along to the
Rag Office, and speak to anyone
you can find! Alternatively, you can
leave a message in the Rag
pigeonhole in the Union Office, or
come along to the weekly meeting
in the Ents lounge, on Friday at
lpm.
when previously he was only able
to crawl.
Turning Point
Turning Point is the largest national
charity helping people with drink,
drug and mental health problems.
Its network of over 40 projects
provides residential rehabilitation,
day care and street level advice,
information and counselling
services. Turning Point's
philosophy is based on the principle
that there is no set cure or single
treatment for these problems, just
as there is no one type of person
who develops them, and no single
reason why. As a housing
association, Turning Point can also
act as a development agent to
manage the acquisition and
development of properties for its
projects.
BLISS
Bliss is a charity concerned with the
welfare of all newborn babies. Bliss
believes that all babies have the
right to the very best start in life,
but is aware that often this does not
happen. The statistics are that 1 in
10 newborn babies need special
care, whilst 1 in 50 needs specialist
intensive care, and whilst these are
theoretically available to every
baby, the allocation of resources is
often haphazard, despite the
dedicated care of medical staff.
Bliss has donated vital equipment to
over 204 hospitals, and also
sponsors the training of specialist
medical staff.
Local charities are chosen by the
Rag committee out of those that
apply to us for cash; this year's
money for local charities has not yet
been distributed, watch this space
to fnd out where it goes! I hope that
this gives you all a slightly better
idea of what happens to money that
is collected or raised under the
name of Rag (as opposed to that
collected for specific charities).
These are the charities chosen by
YOU at last week's Rag meeting,
I hope you are as glad as I am that
we are able to help so many people
through giving time, if not money,
to Rag.
