Under Siege 3rd June Cricket win
Another chance to win fabulous
prizes at FilmSoc? What cinema
gives you these chances? I don't
think I need to say much about
Under Siege, this week's
blockbuster from FilmSoc—it has
been dubbed as Die Hard on a
battleship, and it certainly lives up
to that reputation, being every bit
as good as Die Hard, and
guaranteed to entertain you for the
evening. Tough guy Steven Seagal
as an ex-Navy SEAL (apparently
the US Navy equivalent of a top
SAS man) who is under cover as the
cook on the USS Missouri when it
is hijacked by terrorists with its full
arsenal of nuclear missiles and
heavy duty military hardware
operative. Assisted by all manner
of amazing gadgets, a seemingly
endless supply of machine guns,
and Erika Eleniak from Baywatch,
he puts down his self-raising flour
and saves the world from being held
hostage by bad guys Tommy Lee
Jones and Gary Busey. All in all an
excellent and enthralling film which
benefits more than most films from
being seen on the big screen, with
sound all around, rather than on
video.
This was due to be FilmSoc's last.
fdm in 16mm before we go totally
professional with 35mm next term,
but due to the fantastic tournouts for
Scent for a Woman and The
Bodyguard, we are able to squeeze
in a special showing of Oscar
winning Unforgiven next week.
Come and see what all the fuss is
about, and what the new Imperial
College Union Cinema is like—you
should be pleasantiy surprised. The
nice people in Da Vinci's have their
Happy House between 6 and 7.30,
and you're welcome to bring drinks
up to the Concert Hall for the film
which will start at 7.30, on
Thursday. And, to make the
evening even more special, we have
some brilliant prizes to give away
courtesy of the very generous
people at Warner Brothers. All you
have to do to win an exclusive
Under Siege sweatshirt, cap, or
torch (complete with batteries!) is
to write down your name, and
department, and the name of the
singer-turned-actress who starred in
last night's The Bodyguard—really
difficult! Just hand it in as you
enter, and we'll announce the
winners after the credts.

IC 1st XI vs Goldsmiths
Wed 26 May
UL Cup Quarter Final
IC 1st XI progressed into the semi-
final of the University of London
Cup with a hard earned victory over
Goldsmiths College on Wednesday.
On an overcast day and a green
wicket, which led to seam and
swing, IC won the toss and batted.
IC were left at 25-2 at the loss of
both openers to the new ball, but a
partnership of 93 for the third
wicket between Dafydd Owen and
Jon Mottashed gave IC a strong
position with 15 overs left. The loss
of Owen for 46 and Mottashed for
70 prompted a mini collapse leaving
IC with a disappointing 175-9 after
their 40 overs.
Defending a lower than expected
score Imperial produced a superb
display of bowling and fielding and
although early wickets didn't fall,
Goldsmiths fell well behind the
asking rate. Ben Maxwell's spell at
eight overs from 14 runs was
crucial as he forced the required run
rate higher and higher. Goldsmiths
were forced to play 'big' shots to
up the rate but this only brought
about a flurry of wickets and they
soon buckled under the pressure.
Skipper Mottashed 'tied up' the
victory with 5 wickets to leave IC
victors by 43 runs.
On Sunday IC play for a place in
the U A U quarter finals against
Swansea.
