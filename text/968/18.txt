Like the contents of the witches'
cauldron, ENO's production of
Verdi's Macbeth is a nasty and
fascinating brew. The main theme
of this staging is the abuse of
power; in the programme there are
quotes from The Prince, and on the
stage producer David Pountney has
scattered the trappings of tyranny.
Grey-uniformed quasi-Nazis and
sinister, trenchcoated secret police
surround Macbeth, and Banquo
goes underground to produce
subversive leaflets. While this may
not come as a surprise to Coliseum
regulars (you wouldn't have to
spend very long in the ENO
wardrobe to amass a considerable
pile of military uniforms and
sinister trenchcoats) the treatment
of the witches is more original. The
drab, mischief-making housewives,
where you might have expected
OTT grotesquerie, locate the action
firmly in the sphere of grubby
reality (despite the distorted
Experssionist set) rather than on
some remote supernatural place.
It's a pity that this effect is a little
compromised at the beginning of
Act IV by what appears to be a nod
in the direction of Pantheism, with
the emergence of King Duncan as
Oil a n d B l o o d
How about this for an idea? Take
nine pints of my own blood, cast it
into the shape of my head, keep it
in a refigerated box and pass it off
as art. That's exactly what Mark
Quinn has done. He is one of an
increasing number of modern artists
obsessed with bodily fluids and
functions, a movement which
started with the now infamous
'Pisschrist'. Quinn's work features
in the Young British Artists II
exhibition at the Saatchi Collection.
The blood head, entitled 'Self,
greets you as you enter the gallery.
It sits serenely in its chilled box
eyeing the passers by. There is a
certain charm to its expression, but
the disturbance inherent in the
construction material inspires fear
and revulsion in the viewer. Equally
disturbing is 'You take my breath
away', a latex second skin in the
shape of the artist's body. It hangs
limply, 'Like a used condom', as if
the artist had shed his kin like a
snake. It is a frightening reminder
of the tenuous boundary between
life and emptiness. These sinister
creations inspire the viewer with a
a sort of 'Father Earth' from the
midst of a grotto of petrified
naturalists. The ending is rather
feeble: the dozen branch-carrying
new-age waifs who rush on and
bounce on the royal bed hardly look
capable of routing Macbeth's thugs.
On the first night, Malcolm
Donnelly in the title role was
inititally dull-voiced and seemed out
of his depth, but he soon warmed
up as the sparks began to fly from
Kristine Ciesinski's Lady Macbeth.
Her bright, steely voice is ideal for
the part and her acting is magnetic.
After a gripping sleepwalking
scene, she kills herself in the
shower, daubing the walls with
bilious green blood. John Hudson
is fair to middling heroic as
Macduff; on the strength of his
Malcolm, Anthony Mee may prove
vocally more apt when he has a
crack at the part later in the run.
Mark Elder does sterling work in
the pit (makes him sound like a
Formula One mechanic, doesn't it)
and orchestra and chorus deliver
high-octane performances. This is
grand opera with all the stops pulled
out, and Elder should be well
pleased with his final appearances
as ENO's music director.

Oh ****.' The bed's not made.
past these, however, is something
of a surprise. 20.50 by Richard
Wilson does not feature in the
catalogue, but was by far the most
memorable exhibit. I look through
the door and see a long walkway,
extending above some kind of hole.
It is seemingly suspended in space.
'Don't touch the sides, because of
the o i l ' , the attendant says
cryptically. Oil, what oil? All of a
sudden I looked closer, and
realised. I freak out. Even when I
knew what was going on I couldn't
believe it. The effect that this
exhibit has is strange, other
worldly, vertiginous. I would
describe it, but that would spoil
it—see it for yourself.
Leaving this exhibition many
people would ask, as they so often
do after looking at modern works,
'Is this Art?'. Well, I would reply
'Who cares?'. It's disturbing, its
entertaining, and it has to be seen.

Come on luvvies—this is not the 'Bride of Dracula'
new insight into the wonder of life
and the body. Other sculptures on
display by Quinn are less
interesting, rough cast busts of
historical characters made with
bread dough. They are mildly
pleasing but lack the dark humour
of Quinn's other works.
Sara Lucas' work proves to be
disappointingly uninspiring. A
feminist artist, most of her pictures
were vast photocopies of Sunday
Sport centre spreads. Amusing as
the articles may once have been,
here they are simply a statement.
That statement is too obvious, the
method too predictable. Don't
bother. Before bypassing these
entirely make sure you stop to have
a quick chuckle at Lucas'
'Receptacle of lurid things'. What
is it supposed to mean?
Don't linger too long in 'The
Royal Box'. It only takes ten
minutes to die at —23 degrees. This
is a large industrial freezer unit
which you walk into at the invitation
of an attendant. Inside is a U shaped
wall of ice cubes which provides a
death cold alcove in which to stand
and contemplate existence. This
work stands m complete contrast to
Rose Finn-Kelcey's other exhibit,
'Steam Installation'. Inspiring post
cyberpunk nightmares of rampant
technology, this dimly lit room
contains a large steam producing
device, with a hood. The steam
remains enclosed by a stream of
cold air, swirling around, it projects
dancing images in the spot lights.
The dim lighting, ducts and steam
recall memories of Bladerunner and
Alien, our modern day myths.
Shadows appear in the steam as
other viewers are silhouetted. Who
says air conditioning units can't be
interesting?
Mark Wallinger paints large
pictures. His two works here are
'Capital', seven life-size oil
paintings of homeless people, and
'Race, Class, Sex'—four race
horses. His pictures are well
executed and beautifully painted
studies—something which is very
rare in the world of modern
'Pretentious bullshit' art. They are
technically good but rather lifeless.
I was sure that there was a political
statement behind them, but I
couldn't be bothered to find it. Just
