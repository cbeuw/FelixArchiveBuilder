Is there life after Heaven ? DaveDuCliche and Joe Baguley descend upon
EMI's offices to hunt out one Glenn Gregory, to talk about stardom, Heave
17, the pope and being Ugly
(While Ian Wright talks about being
mistaken for a famous footballer
and being shot at)

Right, I say as we project ourselves
up the escalator at Marble Arch.
There's an interview with a
legitimate pop star just around the
corner (give 'em what they want,
I say - sic. Ed), and being late in
these circumstances is the kind of
situation which demands summary
execution. No trial, pants exuding
tell- tale smells and stains, blubbing
into the blindfold; a proper twat's
death, to be followed by a twat's
funeral. Joe says calm down, Dave.
You've fucked up again, haven't
you? I ask him the time. He looks
at his watch, and wastes precious
seconds. I look helplessly skyward.
We're late. If only shooting oneself
in the foot metaphorically had
visible effects, we'd have an excuse
then, but we're trying desperately
to find Manchester Square, the
enigmatic Glenn Gregory and
entourage. The bulb explodes in my
head again when I remember that
too many questions about Heaven
17 might not go down too well,
dealing as we are with a new
project, Ugly, and new members;
in all likelihood, they may get
pissed off should we be too
obsessed with M r Gregory's T V -
friendly past. I've an idea, Joe, I
say. He turns, a stitch too many in
liis eyebrows. He asks what my idea
is. We play it cool, I say. Oh right,
Dave. Thanks. I'd never have
thought of that.
One of them's been shot at twice,
hasn't he? The other one's played
support to Bros and listens to thrash
metal. And the other one... fuck.
Didn't he used to be the lead singer
(and John Uriel doesn't talk about
being mistakenly called 'Ariel')
Charity
G: Well, two sensible people at the
table. A peak and some sunglasses
D: Which is the one that's been shot
at? twice?
I: Three times now
D: Three times?
I: Naah
of Heaven 17?
So, we arrive at the offices, and
wait for them to turn up. Smart
black leather couch, I say. Joe says,
smart platinum discs, Dave. They
descend the stairs, Glenn Gregory,
John Uriel, Ian Wright. Glenn
Gregory, minus sharp suit, plus cap
and casuals. John looks cute and
scally-esque, Ian looks like
Superman gone seriously mellow.
They smile, shake hands. We
correspond. The consensus, says
Alison of EMI press, is that we go
to the pub. We shrug in a sort of
'suits us' way, stifling the urge to
go weak and shout 'now you're
talking!'. Drinks on EMI. Smart.
Joe takes up position. We assume
you can recognise initials as
representative of names. ' G ' for
'Glenn'; you see? simple enough,
isn't it, and quite painless too. N.B.
For the purposes of this interview,
it would be easy to have a ' J l ' and
'J2', for Joe and John, but as Joe
is only there to take photos and
freeload on Guinness, I decided to
erase his comments. Ha! Teach him
to keep his mouth shut in future,
bloody bugger...
I: Bright here, innit?
D: I'm regretting not bringing any
sunglasses now
D: By whom?
I: (An obliging drunk walks by,
nods politely) By him, by the looks
of it
G: Don't laugh. That's our Radio
One plugger (Everyone laughs)
D:I understand you're keen to bury
Heaven 17? Or rather, leave the
idea of Heaven 17 behind?
G: Yeah, I'm not ashamed of it, I
had a great time and it's a credible
past, I think. You know, there's
nothing wrong with it, but I don't
want it to keep constantly harping
with on Heaven 17, and everything
I do now, is paralleled with Heaven
17, although it's bound to be.
D: (Sympathetically) Yeah.
G: But it was really unlucky, well,
not unlucky, but those remixes
came out just when we were about
to release Ugly stuff. We were in
the studios mixing the single at the
time.
D: It's also confusing because it
coincides with Putting Our House
In Order, and that's got the Heaven
17 remix of 'Gimme Shelter' on it.
G: Well, we just said we'd do that
because it's a good charity, and it's
hard to say 'no'. In fact the only two
charities we've been involved with
were that and the one with Midge
Ure and Bob Geldof
D: Band Aid
G: Yeah. We did that, didn't know
what the bloody hell it was, you
know. Two people call us up, and
ask us to come down and do a bit
of backing singing, and we turned
the corner, and there was press
there, and all these people. It was
really weird. So we said that we
wouldn't do any more charity
things, and the last thing that
Heaven 17 did was that keeping
your house in order
Agadoo
D: did you play a large part in the
remixing of 'Gimme Shelter'?
G: No, well, I did actually. No, it's
true, 'cause it's the last time Martin
(Ware) and I were in the studio.
Well, we did the Sheffield
Wednesday song, but I only did
backing vocals on that
D: How do you think it compares
with the Arsenal song?
G: Far superior.
D: I heard it was a bit Ragga
G: I like Ragga, but it's hardly
Ragga, is it. It's like 'Agadoo'.
Tippa Irie's 'Agadoo'. It's weird
because Ugly aren't totally removed
from Heaven 17, there are other
parallels. But it's like the musical
influences, the sound, Human
League and, dare I say it, Gary
Numan.
D: He's a fascist, Gary Numan.
G: Yeah? We're all tories
J: Oh, I'm a nazi (This, they
persuade us without difficulty, is
their little joke)
D: We've reviewed the single
('Boom the Future') this week. I
really liked it, I thought it a very
smooth production, but there is still
a sense of Heaven 17, circa 'Fascist
Groove Thing' with the chorus
'brothers and sisters'
G: Yeah, well, we didn't know the
bastards were gonna remix it, did
we?
D: How old is it now? thirteen years
ago?
(Joe, speaking completely out of
turn, interrupts with a comment
about 'Boom the Future'): Prefer
the acoustic version myself
G: Lot of people do, but we
