Editorial
I am about to set a historical
precdent for a Felix Editor: I agree
with vast majority of the reforms
that Chris Davidson and his
partners in crime have hammered
together for Imperial College
Union.
Not an earth shattering sentence,
but none the less, I am going to
have to qualify it. Wednesday night
saw the beating through of detailed
changes to Imperial College
Union's structure. It was meeting
that could have been attended by
fifty five people but was not.
Fundamental changes were
discussed and apart from reporting
on Felix, IC Radio and STOIC no
one else knew about it.
Even more interesting was the
voting: On a vote on the powers of
the Entertainments representative,
the people effected by the changes
were united in opposition, their
opinions were ignored. It hardly
seems right people effected should
be dissmissed in this way.
But before any of these decisions
can be put into effect, they must
pass through a Union General
Meeting. This is a gathering that
every one is entitled to attend, but
will be held on the very last day of
the summer term. How can you
seriously expect such significant
changes to be discussed at this badly
chosen time?
The only way to really gauge the
opinions of the membership of
Imperial College Union is to hold
a referendum. This would serve two
purposes, firstly it would ensure
that every student in College was
Felix 9 6 8
aware of the changes and
understood the new structure. By
holding a referendum the aim of
better communication, one of the
reasons behind the restructuring of
the Union, would be clearly
achieved. Secondly, the changes
that are being discussed are
fundamental, upheavals like this
cannot be decided by twenty or
thirty people behind closed doors.
It will show the real metal of these
proposals if their movers can defend
and encourage support form the
whole populous of Imperial.
The cost of this action would be
insignificant compared to the level
of support and communication that
could be achieved if a referendum
was handled properly.lt is argued
that referenda reflect weak
government, I say avoiding a vote
reveals a weak argument. The
pinion

message must be to Chris and
everyone who wants these changes
to happen: Defend yourself, don't
hide behind excuses, come out and
argue your case with the real
members of ICU.

Dear Jonty,
Terribly sorry.
Poddy.
Theft
Dear Felix,
I write as a dismayed Southside
Halls Resident that has recently
learned of the theft of the bicycle
belonging to the Southside Traffic
Security Guard.
The nature of his job means that
he is on and off his bike
continuously, and so it is
impractical for him to lock it up
each time.
Some highly intelligent thief set
themselves the demanding
challenge to sit on a bicycle and
pedal off—and what's more, they
succeeded! Well done, I'm sure
your ingenuity astonishes and
inspires all of us.
A member of our security staff
must now pay £200 to replace his
stolen bike.
We strongly feel that turds like
yourself should be flushed down the
toilet at birth.
Yours sincerely,
Falmouth Keogh Resident.
Disaster
Dear Editor,
I read the article on p i of Felix
Issue 967, 'Shock Horror in
Southside Halls' with some interest.
Although it seems that the actual
electric shock situation might not
have occurred, the story probably
served its purpose—to make people
aware of possible 'substandard'
practices.
Even if the shock did not occur,
from the examples of electrical
wiring in Beit Hall, where I live,
it is not too difficult to imagine such
a scenario.
For example, here in the first
floor of Beit Hall we have four
'temporary' lights in the corridor.
Each light is dangling from an open
termination box on the ceiling by
two wires, delicately (?) wrapped
in electrical tape. The corridor
above us has seven lights for the
same length of corridor. One light
blows and our corridor becomes a
dark tunnel.
Another corridor with similar
'temporary' lighting has electrical
wires dangling almost two feet from
the ceiling.
We are advised that the lighting
is temporary until the 'new' fire
alarm system is installed. I have
been here since October 1992 and
have not seen any action on the fire
system, or the ceiling (which is an
eyesore—waiting for the fire system
to be installed) or the lighting
(waiting for the fire system to be
installed). At the current rate of
progress the 'new' fire system will
be out of date before it is installed.
(One wonders about what fire
protection system is in place until
then).
Admittedly the student
accommodation provided at the
College is reasonably priced for
London, but apart from being
functional, a minimum degree of
safety must be maintained. If the
halls do meet this minimum
standard, it must be only just...
Yours carefully,
Bruce Cartwright,
Beit Hall Resident.
Cat's Eyes
C a n n e s Film Festival
This blatant excuse for film
plugging has been relatively low
key this year. OK so Barry 'I wear
my hairstyle back to front' Norman
got the centre pages in one of the
tabloids and did his usual fifty
minute rant on BBC1. But where
has all the front page coverage
gone? Answer: it's with Madonna,
wherever she is.
H o n S e c - RIP
With the fourth and final sabbatical
to be elected, Imperial College may
face the death of a current one.
Dom 'Boyz is not the magazine for
me but Cosmopolitan is' Wilkinson
could be the last Hon Sec ever.
Next years Hon Sec could possibly
be known as the Deputy President
(Clubs & Societies) and will have
a bit of a change in job description.
But the change has not been
finalised by Council yet. The new
job description is patchy and the
title may change.
So how can you have an election
for a post that doesn't really exist?
End Of E x a m s
Finished your exams? (Aren't you
a lucky bastard!) Bored? Want to
have a rant? Think it's time to air
your views now that you're leaving
so no reprisals can be carried
against you? Well instead of
thinking about writing a letter or a
feature or a review for Felix, GET
OFF YOUR FUCKING ASS
AND DO SOMETHING.
Reviews
Interesting to read what Martin
Godet of Civ Eng 2 had to say about
the music reviews in his letter last
week. Some of it is true (the main
reviewer is N O T pretentious
though, just off his trolley allegedly)
and I can't help agreeing with some
of Martin's arguments.
But what about the other reviews
(Theatre / Film / Opera)? Does
anyone read them?
T h e C a b i n e t Re-Shuffle
I have changed this bloody article
three times so far, because more
information is being made available
as the deadline for Cat's Eyes
approaches.
The lastest on this cheery
Thursday morning is that Lamont's
mother has blabbed to someone that
he has resigned. The Government
Press Office are claiming that they
have had no resignation from him.
Obiturary and update next week.
Spitting Image
This programme has come a long
way from the days of saga's like
The President's Brain and each
series just keeps getting better. New
puppets worth watching are Chris
Eubank, Jilly Cooper and the
pretentious extras that are used for
just about everything. A l l the
classics are still there; The P M , the
Chancellor, the Royal Family.
One new move is the inclusion of
more swearing and sexually related
jokes, hence the transmission time
of 10.45pm. But these add to the
humour, I think, not degrade it as
you might think.
Third episode this Sunday.
