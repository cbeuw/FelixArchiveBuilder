couldn't just release that
D; Were the strings on the acoustic
version arranged electronically?
G: Yeah, the whole thing was done
in twenty minutes. It was as near to
a jam as I've ever been.
D: It was like that track by that crap
American band. Extreme. They
dumped all their gear, and played
it, and it was their biggest hit.
I: D'you reckon we should release
the b-side?
J: On the second chorus, I shout in
the background
Material
(Conversation continues along
equally pale and interesting lines;
I generously allow Joe to clear his
throat once or twice. We have a
smoke, swig our pints laddishly,
and recoil from overbearing
sunlight)
D: So what's up next?
G: I've written about six, probably
re-do two or three now. You see,
the idea at first was to not let
anybody know it was anything to do
with Heaven 17, come in from a
very left-field, k very 'club'
background, there's a track called
'Born with it* and a track called
'Greed', and they're very fast, very
hard, about 145 bpm. like really
fucking fast, really in your face, but
then the remix of 'Temptation'
came out, and every one was really
keen, and I was desperately fighting
against it because it fucked up the
original plan... But, slowly but
surely, everyone, including me, the
record company, friends, we just
had to face the fact that the plan was
no longer any use. And
unfortunately, when people say
Ugly sounds like Heaven 17, we
don't; Ugly sounds like Heaven 17
remixes... But if we had half a hit
with this one...
(Joe, in another rare moment of
lyrical brevity, pops up mid-camera
click to ask another question. I
groan inwardly):What do you
define as half a hit?
G: Top forty, somewhere in the top
forty, just to establish Ugly as a
name, 'cause it's been on tv, it's
been on the Chart Show, been on
The Big Breakfast, so people are
seeing it a little bit. And then there's
the next one, but that depends very
much on what this one does. I
mean, do we go really hard and
weird, 'cause this is like a crossing
point between the coarse, hard stuff
we've done, and the stuff that's on
the album, songs called 'Starlove',
one called 'Prettyhead', one called
'Slow All Over', and they're like
normal songs but done in a weird
wav. kind of like earlv Roxv Music.
pic by Joe Ba;
standard songs but the way they've
been treated, it ain't.normal
J: But it all goes back to songs
I: Like that 'Gimme Shelter' thing
D: Yeah. Thought the Heaven 17
version was the most radical. That
and 808 State's version
G: Well, there was no song. When
we said we'd do it, and all the other
people who'd done it, when we
started to take it apart, and look at
what was there, there was nothing.
It was basically Jagger strutting his
stuff
D: And Keef
J: With lots of drugs and alcohol
G: They're good at that bit
Football
(Interview postponed temporarily as
laughter makes its presence rather
rudely known)
D: You been asked to do any other
POHIO stuff?
G: Yeah, but we refused, 'cause
Ugly were getting delayed,
regularly by about three or four
weeks, and I was being asked to
promote Heaven 17, and I did, until
I just turned round as said no, no
more. From now on I'm Ugly.
Extremely Ugly. 100% Ugly.
D: But your original idea is shafted
G: We can't change anything, we'd
end up chasing our tails. This is
much more a band thing than
Heaven 17; We're going to take
Ugly on tour, and Heaven 17 never
toured
D: But what of accessible pop
songs?
G: You need a few to get
established
J: There's nothing wrong with pop
music, but if you give people ten
singles or ten pop tunes it's not
enough. You've got to give them
something to think about to give
them a good album
D: I quite agree. Do you reckon
Sheffield Wednesday got robbed on
Saturday then?
G: Certainly w e came fucking close
in extra time, iwe'd have given an
extra 5%, just one little extra
push...
D: The disallowed goal?
G: It was disallowable. I'll be there
on Thursday, like I was there on
Saturday, face painted, hat on, with
my Dad
D: They all support Arsenal in our
office
G: Oh really ? \ very gi od team, I
think they .-:tand a very good chance
in the replay...
D: I'm not, I'm from the North
West
G: I think most people hate Arsenal
Fascism
(With the grace and style of a lean
panther, we move effortlessly from
one subject to the next; Football =
>
Fascism. There's a direct
correlation in there, isn't there?)
D: Could the remix of 'Fascist.
Groove Thing' have been better
timed?
G: That was the main reason I had
for agreeing to re-release it, all the
shit that's going on now in
Germany, and there's that band...
D: Skrewdriver
G: Fucking horrid. Should be
stamped out
D: What? Fascism?
G: Remixing Heaven 17. It's a
crime. No, but fascism is
frightening
D: I confess that I find you more
down to earth than I expected
G: I've got red frilly knickers on
' underneath
D: Yeah?
G: And a big orange dildo. with
Heaven 17 tattooed on it
J: Heaven is 17 inches?
G: No, but we're very nearly beer
monsters.
J: Very nearly (He laughs aloud, as
he gulps generously on his
Guinness)
D: You were part of that po-faced
art student, early eighties, new
romantic, er, thing, though, like
Visage and Human League, and
David Sylvian.
G: They're all complete pissheads,
though. No, it was a bit contrived,
all that stuff.
Pope
And we talk some more. We talk
of being mistaken for Kirk Brandon
(Of Spear of Destiny, and close
friend of Boy George), nearly being
the singer of Human League,
Everton's racial discrimination
policy, calling themselves Ugly
rather than naming themselves after
a material (Suggestions included
Chiffon, Crimpolene, and Hessian),
and Glenn's aspirations to the
Papacy. John and lan tell him that
he is already pope. Pope Gregory
17th. He don't kiss the floor, but
he has the voice of an angel. Alison
returns, and lets us in the exclusive
Manchester Gardens for piccies.
We shake hands after Joe has
finished reeling off a few shots and
resisting Glenn's attempts to buy his
camera. 'Later' he calls back, arm
raised in farewell gesture. Adios,
Amigos. Da Svidaniya. We go off
to have a scan of the Wallace
Collection, on their advice. The
beer settles. In no time, we're back
in South Ken; I phone the radio
station, and get them to play
Temptation'. They ao. In the
North West we have a saying, I tell
them.
'Ta very much'.
'Boom the Future' is out now on
EMI/Rhythm King.
