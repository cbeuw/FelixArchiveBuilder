Chris I s a a k — S a n F r a n c i s c o
P a y s
Chris Isaak has always been a
retrospective figure, harking back
to a simpler age of American Pie,
spaceshots and B-movies from the
drive-in. And so it is with 'San
Francisco Days'; even down the the
track listing onthe front cover just
like Otis Reading or Aretha
Franklin did.
It set a scene which trails
throughout the album, without guile
or packaging. The atmosphere is
pleasant and warm, lazy late
summer sun sheds its rays abroad
and Chris warbles on in his rich,
mellow way, covering Neil
Diamond's 'Solitary Man' with an
easy regard characteristic of a man
who's voice is his instrument.
Forget all that grunge-wailing for
a moment, Chris has a voice to
tingle your spine to distraction. A
Hammond organ takes the stage
where required; guitars pick
throughout, gently focussing our
glaze, soloing for only brief
intervals.
'Beautiful Homes' takes you on
a strollin' drive through Beverly
Hills, maybe, where everything's
beautiful. Just like Chris himself,
bequiffed with a chiselled jaw. A
face able to break hearts as a matter
of course should not be able to sing
like Roy Orbison before it's passed
fifty at least (jealousy rears).
'5.15' is the pick of the bunch.
Whereas stations are the
quintessential setting for leaving
songs, we get in deeper this time.
Now dusk is falling, a light breeze
picks up, it ends up a brooding
whisper. You couldn't imagine it at
Paddington, sometimes only the
real thing will do. Chris Isaak is
American, certainly, wholesome as
apple pie, undoubtedly good.

Judging by the cover, these guys
look cool and mean business.
They're a black rock/metal/thrash
outfit from Atlanta with obvious
Living Colour and Fishbone
comparisons, in that they seem to
share defiance coupled with
aggression.
Homelessness, dealers and the
police are all rolled into one with
the funky 'Downtown', while the
titletrack is the absolute showcase,
changing rhythm 3 times, a solid
7-minute stance against racism.
'Red River', an epic also on the
same theme is the good ol' track
perfect for losing brain cells to.
'Lovejoy', 'Black' and 'I A m He'
are also worth noting from a
consistently good debut.
The technical ability of this band
is unquestionable but somehow, the
Everything But T h e Girl
— H o m e M o v i e s
Subtitled 'The Best of Everything
But The Girl', the first thing you
will learn is that you probably
haven't read the Senseless Things
review on the opposite page; if you
have, there is little point my going
over the retrospective/re-evaluation
that is a necessary part of the
'greatest hits' ethos. With 'Home
Movies', the majority of you will
flashback to 1988 for 'Apron
Strings', T don't want to talk about
it' (I will be asking questions about
this at the end of the review, so keep
reading) and 'The night I heard
Caruso sing' from that year's
Tdlewild'.
Another thing is that Ben and
Tracey have tended towards playing
out their relationship in their songs,
and the videos to their songs; I don't
know, but do you feel they've
exploited a sense of universal
voyeurism, that we're all being
tempted to look, and to continue to
look, as they tear themselves apart
for the television? That their
songwriting has tended to circulate
around the submission/domination
of the 'love' thing (did you get that?
that's the ' L O V E ' thing - sic. Ed)
is of further testament to this.
Hmm. And on to the music, I
feel. Yep. It's all beautiful
languorous melodies, sensitively
constructed and delicately executed.
They wrote some great songs, and
it's sad that they're mainly
remembered for cover versions (do
excuse him. I don't quite know why
potentially inspiring ideals on a tried
and tested formula doesn't quite hit
the mark, nonetheless the relative
novelty value of black rock bands
will probably ensure their success.
The ghost of Jimi lives on.

'Native Land' is my first reference
point here, the days of my youth,
Lloyd Cole, 'Body and Soul', Marx
and Sartre, Somerset Maugham,
and a catastrophic relationship with
a girl who had M T V Europe on
Cable. 'Apron Strings' is my next,
and then...
The point is, you may not have
liked them the first time around,
(and God knows, I wasn't keen) but
they occupy a peculiar space in
everyone's closets; they rendered
my relationships and would-be
relationships more emotional and
more sensitive than they deserved,
like Lloyd did once, like The Bible

REM and Steely Dan did with every
bloody song. Part-comic, part-

they are talking to each other again,
too. Bloody Rod Stewart.

Sabbat. Thrash metal with a fiddle
player and a fixation on Merrie
Englande. Whilst difficult to take
seriously, Skyclad are brilliant—but
having said that, 'Jonah's Ark' is
a bit of a disappointment. Unlike
their three previous offerings,
there's not really anything here to
get your knees up to down at the
ceilidh. It's ll good, proficient
thrash which happens to have a
violin in it, that's all. The lyrics are
the usual ranting about how big
businesses are destroying the planet
whilst her inhabitants sit numbly in
front of the television, neatly
summed-up by the (unintentionally)
hilarious pastiche of the spoken
introductions to 'The Eve of the
War' from Jeff Wayne's 'War of
the Worlds', but the music is too
sombre. All the album needs is a
rousing tune like 'The Widerskins
Jig' from the first album, but sadly
that is lacking. It's a shame to see
lunacy of this quality go to waste
on such a preponderance of serious
songs.
