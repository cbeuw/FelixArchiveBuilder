All is not as it seems
Dear Jonty,
I read with some interest your
article concerning the latest Top 40
University Charts. Although the
final results were not available in
your 'organ' we were treated to a
searing, no-holds-barred evaluation
of the pro's of being at the
institution known as IC. I'm sure
readers all across the campus were
secretively clenching their fists in
victory on Friday morning as they
read of Oxford's staggering losses
in 'sciences', barely able to stifle
their triumphant roars after the
defence of our coveted
'Engineering' title. Presumably
U C L were the recipients of only
light guffaws and a modicum of
sympathy for their shameful
struggle into eighth; as for the
hapless St Mary's their puissance as
a seat of medical learning is
obviously only paralleled by an
apparent unwillingness to lick the
revered Dom Wilkinson's boots.
After this jingoistic passage we
are no doubt guaranteed entry into
lucrative trainee programmes of the
opportunity to spend several more
years taking coffee-breaks every
hour and bouncing ground-breaking
ideas off other trainer-clad social
outcasts. Our privileged present
extends into a yawning vista of ever
more glorious prospects. But let's
stop for a moment, look a little
harder at the real situation—it only
needs a brief visit to the JCR or the
Union on a Wednesday to get a
more accurate reflection on the state
of this hallowed college.
I don't care if we are better than
Greenwich at management or
produce a more breathtakingly
mutated from of homosapiens from
the recesses of Chem Eng. I'd bet
we could kick seven shades of shit
out of them at Bible-bashing too, or
wipe the floor with Manchester at
a Qur'an reading session, their
disappointing chart performance
notwithstanding. And to really ram
our superiority home we could send
them a minibus full of guitar-
strumming Raggies ready to bleed
scores of Mancurian pensioners dry
and enjoy every ecstatically fun-
filled millisecond. You can bet
they're all kicking themselves right

now that instead of spending three
years acquiring the best friends
ever, with a common predeliction
for science fiction novellas and lax
personal hygiene, they chose a
profusion of good-looking girls with
a similar racial background.
I spend most of my time on or
near the river with the Boat Club
which happens to have beaten
Oxford and many (any) other
universities you care to mention,
hosted the National Student Indoor
Rowing Championships and
virtually has the U A U title
permanently installed in its trophy
cabinet. The alternative hours spent
in lectures or exams trying to
compete with people who have had
their personalities surgically
removed in order to fit in more
textbooks swallowed whole, could
be described as 'unappealing', but
as long as I get some sort of degree
I can just live off IC's—no doubt by
then—global reputation as a genius
factory.
I haven't ever seen a copy of
'Phoenix', the creative, arts
magazine but we seem to have no
shortage of lucid and helpful music
reviews or the unbounded sagacity
and wit of P J Dodd. The Editor's
thinly-veiled contempt for the
medical school across the park was
also undoubtedly a factor in their
slamming but all the Mary's rowers
I have met do not share his
paranoia—and at least if they want
to go to their Union Bar, get loaded
and chat up good-looking
girls.. .they can. Imperial is not, like
the t-shirt says, 'Probably the best
University in the World' although
if Southside and Linstead Halls
were levelled and the resultant
rubble used to fill in Beit Quad,
preferably on a Friday night at
chucking-out time, we'd be in with
a fighting chance. Don't try and
pretend we're all pulling together,
that this is the best place since
McDonald's. Everybody is in this
place for themselves and if they
don't hate the work they hate the
people or in some cases, both.

Gav's dead
Dear Jonty,
Re: Gav's not paying (Felix 967)
We don't care where Gavin
Pearson's money goes so long as
he's run over by the bus.
Yours finger-cwssingly.
