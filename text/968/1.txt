PhDs discouraged Sutherland slips out
by D e c l a n Curry

Access to PhD places will be further
restricted under the new White
Paper for Science, Technology and
Engineering, published this week.
The document, the first government
policy paper on science for more
than 20 years, plans to make the
Masters MSc degree the basic
degree for a career in research. The
White Paper says that 'PhD training
will be properly underpinned'.
The document, Realising our
Potential: A strategy for Science,
Engineering and Technology, will
also force a sweeping change within
Research Councils and Advisory
Boards. William Waldegrave, the
Science Minister, said that the
research councils needed
restructuring 'to reformulate their
missions and strengthen their links
with industry.'
The Science Engineering and
Research Council (SERC) is being
split into two different bodies, the
Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council (EPSRC), and the
Particle Physics and. Astronomy
Research Council (PPARC). The
Agriculture and Food Research
Council will be modified to form
the Biotechnology and Biological
Sciences Research Council. Other
research councils remain
unaffected. A l l the research
councils will come under the control
of the new Director General of
Research Councils. The Director
General is responsible to civil
servants at the Science Ministry,
and replaces the independent
Advisory Board for the Research
Councils. The White Paper also
abolishes the Advisory Council of
Science and Technology in favour
of the new Council for Science and
Technology.
No modifications have been made
to the funding system for basic
university research. Funding for
teaching and general research will
continue to come from the Higher
Education Funding Council
(HEFC). Universities will have to
develop more employer-friendly
research training. Cooperation
between industry, science and
government will be strengthened by
the new 'Technology Foresight'
initiative, which allows for the
exchange of ideas and expertise.
The annual development of
science and technology in the
United Kingdom will be published
in a new statement, to be known as
'Forward Look'. Attempts will be
made to increase the public
perception and understanding of
science with a series of exhibitions,
demonstrations, fun and games
culminating in the 2001 Great
Exhibition.
