Technophobia
Jonty Beavanremembers with horror having to cope with technology and
the way technology dealt with him
When I first came to Imperial
College I concealed a secret. It
could not stay uncovered for long,
but I hid it nonetheless, for I was
ashamed. The fact was that I was
and still am, a mechanical
incompetent.
To some people machines quiedy
whisper their most intimate
problems, to me they just whirr and
click. Other fortunate individuals
can look at an ailing mechanism and
say, the problem must be here. I
would not know where to begin.
This fact is not crippling normally,
but, I was about to begin a course
at the foremost Science and
Technology College in the United
Kingdom; it appeared that I had
overstepped the limit somewhat.
Lectures were fine, everyone has
them, everyone can cope with them,
but then came laboratory work. No
more could one of your mates do
all the work while you chatted, it
was three solid hours puzzling over
huge mazes of metal. Everyone
around you muttered
enthusiastically about how fast the
speed of light really was and how
close you were getting to the real
answer. OK, so you know the
answer, why bother doing the
experiment then?
Life was not as bad as it first
seemed because we had supervisors
to help us along the way. That was
nice as long as you spoke to the
right one. In general Lab
supervisors came in three flavours
all linked by a common thread of
stupidity. The first kind were
hateful: You are stupid and I will
not answer your question because
to speak to you is far below my
intellectual capacity, was the
message you received from their
contemptuous faces. It was even
worse when they spoke to you; 'No,
work it out for yourself that is what
you are here for'
'But I don't understand why..'
'Why don't you try thinking
about it then?' is a typical exchange
of views.
The others were sympathetic,
attempting to help above and
beyond the call of duty: 'Well why
don't you try it like this. .No not like
that, like this...No, no, no, the
other way up.. .Wait! the blue one
Don't make me do any more
not the red one...It's O K I'll do it
for you'. This was worse, they
knew you were stupid, you knew
you were stupid, but no one was
going to admit it. As my temper
grew a little unstable, I kept saying
to myself, they think they are
helping, indulge them, they don't
mean to patronise you.
The final category were easily
identified, everything they said
began with the phrase: 'That is a
very interesting question..'. It was
heartening to know that someone
had less knowledge or interest in
what was happening than yourself.
But at least they where aware of
basic mechanics, something which
I was painfully ignorant. For
example looking for fringes in a
light diffraction: 'Turn the dial until
the fringes come into focus', 'I can't
see them', 'Keep on going.. No, if
you unscrew that nut any more the
apparatus will fall to pieces'.
Most dreaded of all was
electronics, firsdy you had to attend
a lecture course before starting.
Personally, I believe anyone who
can stand up for fifty minutes and
talk about electrical circuits should
be put out of their misery as soon
as possible. But talk they did, and
experiments, please!
talk, and talk, a blank appears in my
life when I look back on that time.
It was as if someone had gone and
stolen the sound track to a home
made movie, I was there, people
walked around, pointed to things,
but the words and meaning are just
absent.
Then came the lab. Each and
every one of us was given what
looked like a lego building block
and told this was going to be the
place where our electronic dreams
would be created. A few hours later
a primary-coloured, multi-legged
spider had appeared on my lego
block and it didn't work. Lego was
more fun when you had building
bricks and little men to play with.
I tried begging for help, A superior
supervisor walked over and stated
what was glaringly obvious to him;
'Well you put that wire here and it
should work'. Of course I slap my
skull and curse myself with new
Archimedean insight, all you have
to do is put all the wires in all the
holes and one variation is bound to
work.
But as the saying goes, to really
fuck things up requires a computer.
Again I was 'challenged' by firstly
a lack of knowledge and then
inquisitiveness that less charitable
people called nosiness. The result
meant I was frequently floundering
around in the deep end. Take this
case, 'Why does this not work?'
'You haven't formatted your
flip-flops'
'But why do you have to do that?'
'Because the initial set up drivers
can't interface the memory cached
hard disk without the pre setup
code'
'Ah, what does that mean?' and so
on.
Once it did work, it was a
moment of glory, triumph and
passion. I stood up next to my
terminal and shouted 'Yes, it
worked, at last, it has printed, My
name is Jonty, all the way down the
screen'. It was very quiet in the rest
of the Lab, in one careless moment
I had become the focus of all the
contempt, these bespectacled
terminal tappers could muster.
After three years studying here,
I send out a call. Was I really the
only one? Did anyone else just like
the ideas of science but not the
harsh reality? If there is anyone
else, please don't give up hope,
because you are not alone.
