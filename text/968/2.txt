Mary's election results leave no swansong
In a sweeping victory, Marc Swan
was re-elected as St Mary's
Students' Union President for a
second year running.
Mr Swan, at this year's St Mary's
elections, scored his triumph over
Marc Atkinson and Pete Kahn. The
results were 233, 68 and 76
respectively. M r Swan will now
continue to represent St Mary's
students in external affairs.
Other election results saw the
post of Vice President (Internal) go
to Syed 'Mazza' Masud, beating
Helen Snock by a margin of 245 to
139. The Clubs Rep election was
claimed by Jon Houghton forcing
Aquel Jamil into the next best
position by a margin of 89 votes.
The crown of Welfare Rep was
placed on the head of Karen
Chumbley. Ms Chumbley won 199
votes, beating rival Nicky Wilson
by 68 votes. The final position of
Assistant Social Secretary saw
Andy Wilks crossing the finish line
in the most closely contested
election. M r Wilks secured his
position by only 48 votes.
Additional celebrations have been
taking place at St Mary's as the
Medical School's Music Society
announced its 1st Music Exhibition.
The prize of Â£100 towards tutorship
at the Royal College of Music was
awarded to Fiona Kelly.
New IC Radio franchise holders announced
by Paul Dias
The elections for the committee of
Imperial College Radio were held
on Wednesday, but failed to
produce many surprises. The only
hotly contested post this year was
that of Station Manager. The
candidates standing were James
(Jaymz) Handley and Adam
Blackaby, who are both IC Radio
Assistant Station Managers this
year, and New Election. The
candidates were questioned on
subjects ranging from improving
programme quality to what colour
IC Radio's studios should be
painted. After a close vote, James
Handley was elected, and takes over
as Station Manager from Dave
Cohen, on August 1st. The other
major changes during the evening
were Paul Dias taking over from
Declan Curry as News Editor and
Melissa Parcell becoming
responsible for the Record and Tape
Library. A dead-heat between
Catherine Low and New Election
means that the election for the post
of Treasurer will have to be re-held.
The other results see litde change
from this year's committee, with
Steve Dunton as Technical
Manager, Mellisa Ali as Secretary,
Donna Sibley in charge of Publicity
and Promotions, and Neil Bond as
Head of Music. The new Assistant
Station Managers are Ian Parish,
Adam Blackaby, Amran Hassa and
Abi Adeboyo.
Patten puts Queen in student union horror
by D e c l a n Curry
New laws cracking down on student
unions may be outlined as early as
this November. The Financial
Times reports that the next Queen's
Speech will contain plans by John
Patten, Education Secretary, to
reform student union membership
and funding. The decision now
clears the way for M r Patten to
make his long anticipated
'announcement' on voluntary
membership.
The much postponed students'
charter has also been published by
the Department for. Education
(DFE). The draft 'Charter for
Higher Education' contains none of
the contentious ideas which caused
a Cabinet clash on the contents last
February. Plans for removing grant
awarding and fee paying powers
from local education authorities
(LEAs) have been quashed, as has
the proposal for the unified grant-
fee-student loan paying body.
The Government instead plans to
speed up the payment of grants, fees
and loans. Students must now be
told 'quickly' by their L E A if they
are entitled to a maintenance grant.
Written reasons and details of the
appeals procedure must be given if
the application is refused. The sum
awarded must be explained, and the
first instalment must be ready for
collection at the start of the first
term. If a delay is likely, the L E A
must warn students in advance.
Tuition fees must also be paid on
time. Complaints about grants and
fees should be made to the Local
Government Ombudsman.
Universities are to speed up
student loan applications, and must
have eligibility certificates ready for
students within two weeks of
application. Decisions on access
fund grants must be made within 4
weeks of the final deadline, but
universities are still left to invent
their own rules on eligibility. The
Charter states that you 'can be
considered for help if you are in
severe financial difficulty'.
The Government Charter notes
that students have responsibilities
'to get the most out of teaching and
learning'. Students, it reads,
'should take part in seminars and
attend lectures on time'. The
Government Charter insists that
universities provide 'well-informed
guidance arid counselling from
tutors and careers staff. Students
are also entitled to expect the
university to make 'proper
arrangements for student security'.
A Government plan to link
student assessments of lecturers
with lecturers pay has been dropped
after lobbying from the Committee
of Vice Chancellors and Principals
(CVCP) and trade unions. The
Charter now states that 'more and
more universities are encouraging
high quality by including a
performance related part in staff
pay'. Student opinions of
departments are to be 'taken
account of by Funding Councils'.
The Higher Education Quality
Council (HEQC) will audit
universities regularly, and an
official summary of their report
must appear in the University
prospectus. Information about the
performance of universities
including degree results and
proportion of graduates gaining
employment is to be compiled by
the Higher Education Funding
Council (HEFC), also for inclusion
in the prospectus. Students are
entitled to complain if a university
does not meet its standards, and can
object to misleading information in
a university prospectus. These
complaints can be sent to the
HEQC.
The proposed Charter has no
power or sanctions to enforce many
of its provisions. Lorna Fitzsimons,
NUS President, said the Charter
'lacked teeth,' and was 'descriptive
rather than proscriptive.' The DFE
says it is 'keen to seek views' on the
charter, and suggestions will be
accepted by the DFE in Great Smith
Street until 2 July.
Men at work
by Bryan C r o t a z
The warden of Linstead Hall has
been inundated with complaints this
week as electricians installed new
fire alarms.
Dr Jan Bradley said she was
concerned that she had not been
informed about the fitting of the
alarms. Dr Bradley was also
worried that students had to vacate
their rooms for a day to allow the
work to be done. Linstead residents
say the work played havoc with
vital revision. 'The whole hall
vibrated with a horrible noise,' an
occupant told Felix.
The complaints follow similar
incidents in Selkirk and Tizard
Halls last week, when workmen
removed tiles from showers. The
work was stopped after Dr John
Hassard, Selkirk-Tizard warden,
complained to the College Estates
Division. A n Estates spokesman
said the renovations were
'regrettable but necessary'.
Dr Hassard said that this was the
wrong time of year to carry out such
work. The Selkirk-Tizard warden
added that the improvements would
allow more rooms to be during
holidays by the Conference Office.
'This Hall is primarily for students,
not for summer lettings,' he said.

Tumbling student numbers and an
imminent cash crisis may force a
merger of departments within the
Royal School of Mines (RSM).
John Archer, College pro- Rector
is now drawing up consultative
plans which could change the
character of the RSM.
The spur for the consultations is
rising debts in all R S M
departments. RSM budgets will be
readjusted on 28 June. Felix
understands that these budgetary
readjustment may include
'renegotiated employment
contracts', or sackings.
The deficit in Geology is
attributed to the high cost of
teaching undergraduates. The
proposals emphasise that
postgraduate and other research
brings in more funding overall to
the department. A joint degree
involving Material Sciences and the
Physics, Mechanical Engineering
and Aeronautics departments is also
suggested, as is closer collaboration
between M R E , Geology and the
Centre for Environmental
Technology.
