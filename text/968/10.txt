The Journey of a Lifetime
Sacrifice and commitment as Rafi Shafi, of EEI, takes a look at the Hajj
around it and their meaning.
The harmony ofpeople and society
can be gained only through mutual
understanding of other cultures.
This can best be achieved through
the effective andproper usage ofthe
communication technology that has
turned the world into a small
village. Despite this it is a shame
that a religion that inspires over a
billion people around the globe
today has remained enshrouded in
mystery and misconception. This is
also true, contrary to the
expectation, for a multicultural
society such as Britain, where there
are about 2 million Muslims. Today
one finds that people, even at
Imperial College, are unaware of
thefeelings and celebrations oftheir
fellow Muslim classmates and
friends. Therefore I invite you to
read some of my thoughts
concerning the oncoming
celebration, the Celebration of
Sacrifice.
Muslims believe that
Islam is the final form of
the same Message that
was delivered to all the
Prophets.
Muslims believe that Islam is the
final form of the same Message that
was delivered to all the Prophets
(may God be pleased with them).
The first man was Adam and who
was appointed as the first prophet.
He called people around him to
testify that there is only one God,
the Lord and Sustainer of the
universe, and not to join partners
with Him. He warned mankind of
a Day that was approaching when
everything in the universe would be
destroyed and man would be
questioned about his deeds in this
life. Then those who believed in
God and worked righteousness, not
joining any partners with Him
would be sent to Paradise to enjoy
eternal peace and those who
disbelieved in Him, mocked at His
signs and worked evil would be sent
to Fire.
During the passage of time the
Message was corrupted and the
children of Adam started
worshipping other deities.
Therefore God sent down other
Prophets to remind people of the
Message. Noah, Abraham, Moses,
David and Jesus (may God be
pleased with them) were all
members of this chain and
Muhammad (peace be upon Him)
was the last link in this chain of
prophethood. Naturally as a result
the source of information is unique.
It is not surprising that a number of
historical events mentioned in the
Qur'an show a big similarity to the
ones in the Bible, albeit with some
differences. Hence many important
and sacred events and places for
Jews and Christians are also
important and sacred for Muslims.
The Ka'bah in "Mecca was
initially built by Abraham and His
son Ishmael as the first house of
worship for mankind. When
Muhammad was appointed as a
prophet, the Ka'bah had alreadv
been filled with idols. The pure
monotheistic worship had been
corrupted and people had started
worshipping the idols within the
Ka'bah. Nevertheless, it was still an
attraction point for many people
from all over the Arabian
Peninsula.
Many important and
sacred events for Jews
and Christians are also
important and sacred for
Muslims.
Islam cleared the Ka'bah from the
idols and forbade idol worshipping.
The pilgrimage to Mecca was
ordered by God to be performed in
the same manner as Abraham
established, solely for the pleasure
of God. It is one of the pillars of
Islam and it must be fulfilled by all
those who are able to undertake the
journey. Today Muslims from all
over the world come to Mecca at
the time of the pilgrimage in order
to fulfil their duty, symbolising the
unity of mankind whether they are
black or white. A l l are dressed
identically regardless of wealth. A
head of state and a normal citizen
can not be distinguished during the
pilgrimage.
Today, at this very moment
millions of pilgrims are praying to
God Almighty in Mecca. The
harmony, beauty and unity of this
gathering can only be described by
the people who have already been
there. The following is former
boxer Mohamed Ali's description:

my life. But thefeelings I had while

I felt exalted by the indescribable
spiritual atmosphere there as over

exhilarating experience to see
people belonging to different
colours, races and nationalities,
kings, heads of states and ordinary
men from very poor countries all
clad in two simple white sheets
praying to God without any sense
of eitherpride or inferiority. It was
a practical manifestation of the
concept of equality in Islam'
At the end of this gathering
Muslims sacrifice an animal (a
sheep or goat) for the sake of God.
This is the day of celebration all
over the world for Muslims. They
visit each other, reconciliating any
differences, to tighten the bonds
within society.
Like their brothers and sisters in
Mecca, Muslims around the world
also sacrifice an animal on that day.
The animal sacrificed is
traditionally divided into three
portions: the first portion is
distributed to the poor, the second
is given to neighbours and friends
in order to strengthen the
relationship between them, and the
third portion is for family members.
This may change since the whole
animal may be sent to poor people.
A head of state and a
normal citizen cannot be
distinguished during the
pilgrimage.
For example today in Britain, many
Muslims are sending money for the
sacrifice to needy, poor and
starving countries such as Ethiopia,
Sudan, Somalia and Bosnia through
charity organisations.
The sacrifice is not only about the
distribution of meat. "It is not their
meat nor their blood, that reaches
God: it is your piety that reaches
Him. He has thus made them
subject to you that ye may glorify
God for His guidance to you and
proclaim the good news to all who
do good" The Qur'an (22:37). The
perfect example of this piety of
sacrifice can be found in the
Prophet Abraham. He was
commanded to sacrifice his only son
Ishmael for the sake of God. The
integrity and purity of his intention

of Ishmael. It is in commemoration
of this that Muslims today celebrate
this event. The celebration is about
sacrifice and indeed this is the entire
essence of Islam in that you
sacrifice your own whims and
desires and submit wholly and
sincerely to the will of God. "The
Religion before God is submission
to His will" The Qur'an (3:19).
All praise is due to God the Lord
and Cherisher of the universe.
