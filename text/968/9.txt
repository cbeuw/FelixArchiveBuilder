Have you got what it takes to write a romantic novel? Rachel Basset
throws back her head and gasps as she tackles the Mills and Boon
Factor.
'Saul, please'
'Please what?'
'Please-help me'.
He held still for a moment, as
though her words had surprised
him, but when her hips moved in
an instinctive little movement
against his leg he lowererd his head,
and drew the throbbing aureole into
the heated cavern of his mouth...
Wham! Bam! Thank you ma'am!
And as Saul continues to gratify
Cadace's baser urges, women
countrywide sink back into their
armchairs, pop another Milk Tray
into their mouths and turn the page,
hungry for the next nipple-tingling
installment from Robyn Donald's
'Darker Side of Paradise'.
If insight into the erotic fantasies
of several million women is what
your heart desires, you need look
no further than Mills and Boon
Romances, which are textbook
studies. They cover it all—palm-
fringed tropical locations, designer
dresses, powerful Jaguar-driving
men, beautiful women, and above
all, Sex. Passionate Sex. Juicy,
squelchy, no-details-spared Sex.
So what are the conditions for
these fantasies on paper? What
points should a good author always
include? Well, the first golden rule
of Mills and Boon sex is that she has
to be a virgin, and he never is. The
reason for this is, I presume, to stop
her looking promiscuous and also
that most of the heroes are in their
mid-thirties and there has to be
something slightly suspect about a
35-year-old virgin. It smacks of
smelly nylon socks and bedsits.
Also, it might look as if he was
getting desperate and that would
never do, so he has to be
'experienced'. (A particularly
revolting euphemism for virgin
frequently used is 'inexperienced',
as in 'He was remorseful. 'The last
thing I would have expected was
that you were inexperienced'. Did
I hurt you, sweetheart?").
The second golden rule is to be
very explicit and excruciatingly coy
simultaneously. There are certain
words, it seems, that just don't fit
the M & B image, so, for example,
She had been made for him, she
decided, knowing even as the silken
length ofhim thrust inside her that
he would fit perfectly, that he
always had.
is perfectly acceptable, but the
words w*lly, c*nd*m, or b*tt*m
must remain taboo. No mucky or
unglamorous bits are allowed, so
nobody has periods, nobody ever

goes to the toilet and quite certainly
nobody prematurely ejaculates.
Officially, nobody has genitals
either but by careful reading we can
deduce their presence. A veil of
euphemism is preserved, leading to
cryptic statements like 'she raised
her hips to him for the most intimate
kiss of all' (whatever that means).
A very common scene is a mock
rape, or near rape, where the hero
'uses his superior strength' against
the struggling heroine. Whether or
not this is a particular female
fantasy, I don't know, but it seems
to be popular. You may notice I
choose my words carefully—the
reason it's mock rape is that the
struggling heroine wants it really,
the silly little tease, she's just too
uptight to say so. Of course. A l l
mock rapes include an abundance
of phrases along the lines—
The agony of the whole thing was
that her traitorous body wanted
quite violently to respond to the
cavalier treatment it was receiving,
to thrust itself closer...
It was then that her fury died as
other more treacherous emotions
made themselves known.
Another popular storyline is that
the hero and heroine find
themselves, for whatever carefully
manufactured reason, married. This
is a good storyline from the points
of view that 1) they can't stop living
together, 'cos everyone would
guess they were faking, so there's
plenty of time for them to fall in
luuuurrve and 2) so that once they
fall in luuurrve, they can shag at
once without seeming immoral and
upsetting Grandma. M & B quite
clearly have it all sussed.
Criticism apart, though, it's all
gripping stuff, and a good solid
dose of escapism for the more
frustrated amongst us, she typed
passionately, muscular fingers
thrusting even harder and deeper
against the word processor keys as
the article drove on relentlessly to
its climax. She could only gaze at
the screen in wonderment as she
groped and writhed for words,
endlessly seeking fulfilment and for
a good ending. At last, though, at
last her heart beat faster and the
blood raced in her veins as she
sensed the article coming to an
end—yes, it was coming, oh yes.
Her throat tensed in a silent scream
of triumph. Oh yes, oh yes.
Was it good for you too?
