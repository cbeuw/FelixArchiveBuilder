Senseless Things: Me next for the Butane
T r a s h C a n S i n a t r a s —
I've S e e n Everything
The first time I saw the Trash Can
Sinatras (not to be mistaken with
Leicester Funk Popsters The
Sinatras or indeed old blue eyes
himself) they were supporting
Prefab Sprout. Now some three
years on whilst Paddy leads his
remaining followers on a one way
trip to Waco (and I don't mean
Michael) the TCS's are promoting
their second album with this their
second single from it.
With a sound owing much to the
80s postcard bands they jangle in a
way only Scotland's finest can (and
we're talking Edwin and Roddy not
the Bay City Rollers).
This won't be a hit. It's
thoughtful, and relies far too much
on melody. Christ, they don't even
wear flares.. .Of course if a certain
jeans company was to get hold of
them. No, fuck off Trash Can
Sinatras are mine, you can have
your P.J. Suedemaker Quartet.

It can only be six months since
people started to get interested in
Suede, but already they have
become an anachronism. Blending
into the 'dead subversive, mate'
scene we have come to know and
love.
Certainly they were a necessary
shot in the arm for the British music
industry, but to that end you could
say they filled the proverbial 'gap
in the market'. The whole thing
smacks of conspiracy; they sign to
Nude records, an independent label
definitely not set up by Sony to gain
some cred for their new boys,
honest (really, Glyph, you're so
suspicious - sic Ed); the abrupt
T h e S e n s e l e s s T h i n g s — T o o
M u c h K i s s i n g
Beware ye, the godawful word
'retrospective'; when a band
explores their past as an objective
item, rather than subjectively ' in
song..
I've never been much of a fan of
Senseless Things, ever since I saw
them on the main stage at Reading
a few years back, counterpointed
against The Pooh Sticks in the
Acoustic Tent. 'Too Much Kissing'
is their debut single revisited, and
quite a bijou songette it is too. I'm
not going to write home about it,
but I might just take their name off
my list for Tipper Gore's bonfire
party.
Then again, I might not.

Trashcan Sinatras: So. We're shit are we?
departure of the female member of
the band (but we've never actually
had a homosexual experience,
America! I said, we've never...);
and of course, the substance of the
band. David Bowie and Johnny
Marr (or, Moz and the sadly-
missed Mick - sic. Ed) with the two
stooges that would never remind
anyone of the Smiths (and we don't
do encores, either - but that's purely
coincidental).
Thank you for turning some
heads, making some good records,
and generally livening things up a
bit, just when it looked like the
Wonderstuff were set for a big
comeback. But you've said it now
so take the money and run. I hear
Florida is nice this time of year, and
they just love those cute little
cockney accents, man (just think;
that homosexual experience so
important to you is just around the
corner! Tee hee! bet you can't wait
- sic Ed) I wonder how Male Mac
kept his name out of it this time.
Oh, shit, the record. Uggh! It's
a slowish number about having
homosexual intercourse and
freebasing smack. Funny that, Eh?

They'll probably be doing another
gig soon, but will you get in to see
it? Ha. Like fuck you will. Ah,
well. At least he doesn't sing 'he is
gone/dead/gay/in the chippy/
centreback for Barnet F . C this
time. Crap drugs reference, though.

S w i t c h b l a d e Sister
Glorious heroin-redd vinyl offering
nascent genius in a double 'A'-sided
single, paring off 'Switchblade
Sister' with 'What's wrong with
me' and looking the paragon of
aceness. Crack-happy nakedness on
cover, not, this time, featuring a
certain relative of a certain director,
but nonetheless an appearance
approaching apocalyptic. Now,
considering the variously cool
things stated above, it fits that the
tracks are guitarred grooves gone
renegade in cocksure fighting rock;
they are. No surprise that Redd
Kross are going on tour with
Dinosaur Jr, either.
Fucken' smart buggers.

Front 2 4 2 — R e l i g i o n
More mechanoid than the T-1000
Nastier than Union Carbide
More elitist than the SS

So hard you could wax it and call
it marble.
Tyranny for you, Herrenvolk!

'Deliriously irresistable garage

Alright, take your word for it.
Just don't try buying clothes for
me, will you.

P a w — J e s s i e
(Light slowly emanates over the
stage, dressed as a wintry field. The
sound of a man drawing weighty
hunks of breath builds delicately,
and a figure is dragged onto the
stage by a leash attached to a large
slavering dog; the figure is tall,
thin, with shoulder-length and
sweat-matted hair, and wears a
black leather greatcoat. Behind and
to the left, a stallion gallop of drums
makes an impressive entrance)
KER-CHUNK! KER-CHUNK!
Man with dog: Jessie!
KER-CHUNK! KER-CHUNK!
(Dog turns threateningly)
Dog: Growl...
Man: (in fear) good girl, nice
Jessie...
(Dog leaps on man and savages
him. Man screams. Dog growls
some more. Man dies. Dog runs
off) (Exeunt) (Curtain)
Noisy. Rough. Well 'ard.

U L U on the 28th. Today, in fact.
Wakey, wakey! Look at you. I ask
you. Lights on, door open, no-one
home.
