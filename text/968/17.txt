H a m l e t
Caroline Gordon's production of
'Hamlet' presents us with a nearly
complete version of Shakespeare's
masterpiece. Indeed, she cuts only
two scenes (those featuring the
Norwegian Fortinbras) and
personally I think the play is better
without these.
However, I do argue with Steven
Elder's portrayl of the tragic hero.
Elder, from the outset, plays a
moody, angry, and very loud
Hamlet - one who seems mad from
the start. Likewise, Catherine
George as Ophelia begins the play
a little less than mentally stable. In
both cases, madness seems a little
premature. David Arrowsmith
plays a smarmy Cladius with a
smile that is alone enough to have
him condemned as a murderer. As
for Gertrude (Sally Mortemore),
she seems so caught up in her lust
for Claudius that a true relationship
between Hamlet and his mother
fails to emerge, and whilst the ghost
scenes verge on sadistical (with
Hamlet at times assuming the
position of Christ on the cross),
Hamlet's relationship with Gertrude
could never be accused of being
Oedipal.
Gordon's production throws up
some interesting ideas, but on the
whole they seem to get lost in the
melodrama and sheer volume of the
production. If you like your
Shakespeare over the top, this might
be for you.

If you thought that Bill & Ted were
two phrase repeating, dim-witted
teenagers that could rarely string
together a few coherrent sentances,
yet alone a few minutes of half-
decent acting, then you are going
to hate this video. It's crap. Watch
dribble like Raw Soup or The Real
McCoy instead.
B o o m e r a n g
Eddie Murphy in yet another role
that allows him to be surrounded by
wealth and women. After fifteen
minutes I switched off and watched
the news instead. If we had a rating
system, it would get fuck all.

S m a l l G o d s : Terry Pratchett T o m f o o l e r y
Brighdy coloured, intricately drawn
cover, paperback, about four
hundred pages, written in a reader
friendly style, contains understated
wit, a large number of 'in' jokes
and set in fantastical world which
rides around the Universe on the
back of a turtle. Yes Inspector, it
looks like another Pratchett book
has hit the bookshelves again, and
this time its taking no prisoners.
But Sergeant, is it any different
to the hordes of other Pratchett
novels that weigh down the local
branch of W H Smiths?
Frankly inspector, No, but if I
many venture an opinion, Sir?
Please do, Sergeant. We are
protectors of good taste here, no
thought or cognitive process will be
disciplined, only the heinous crime
of banality can be punished.
Well Inspector, it appeared to be
rather more satirical than usual Sir,
it appeared that the dread author had
targetted organised religion and
parodied it with his gently
humorous style.
But were any of the jokes
different Sergeant?
Hardly Sir, but a good many
were pleasantly amusing.
Overall, what was your
impression?
Same as before Sir, No surprises.
What do drink motivates this man
Pratchett to keep writing these
books?
The money I would imagine Sir.
And where do you think we will
find him, Sergeant?
Almost every-bloody-where Sir.
The Hair Bear Bunch
When originally written in America
by Tom Lehrer, back in the 'good
old days' of the late fifties and
sixties, his satirical songs were
banned in this country. Listening to
them, it's not hard to reason why.
He can come across as anti-war and
anti-government, but don't all
satirists?
He does an excellentjob of taking
the piss of everything from activists
that sing ridiculous folk songs, to
the American government, to the
notion of livening up church songs
and an ingenious send up of the
Irish and their extremely long
songs. Out of all the 27 songs, my
favourites were; 'I Got It From
Agnes', a dirty little number about
the transmission if 'it'; "The Vatican
Rag', the best satirical religious
'sketch' that I have ever seen or
heard; 'The Masochism Tango',
which is self explanatory; and
'Smut', which is also pretty much
self explanatory.
The level of satire surpasses
anything ever said on 'Have I Got
News For You' and it is delivered
in an exquisite style than Angus
Deayton would have problems
imitating. A l l the cast are, well,
look up the words 'excellent' and
'funny' in the thesaurus and all
positive derivatives apply. I love the
songs, the cast, everything. I
thought there could be such a thing
as too much satire in one evening,
I was wrong. Go and see this.

Chaplin
Not as good as the wide screen
version as seen in the cinema, but
at least you can stop it if you need
to get a drink or whatever. Not that
you really need to, because it is
captivating for the whole two and
a bit hours.
Sniper
Not another blood and guts film
with sweet fa for a storyline as you
might expect, although it does have
it's fare share of gore. Quite a good
film.
Sister A c t
Better and funnier than some of the
critics have said. You should all
know the storyline, so just sit back
and enjoy Whoopi (nice name !) in
possibly one of her best roles.
Phur E. Cat.

B o d y Of E v i d e n c e
Blatant excuse for Madonna to get
her clothes off (not that she really
needs one) and a chance to see a few
perverse practices in widescreen.
A c c i d e n t a l H e r o
Dustin 'Rain Man' Hoffman, Geena
Davis and someone whose name I
forget star in this effort about a
tramp who becomes, surprise
surprise, an accidental hero. Not
bad.
G r o u n d H o g Day
Bill Murray in one of his best
comedies yet. The day is repeated
just enough times and the humour
can be a bit black.
Indecent P r o p o s a l
Great idea, shit film. Avoid.
J u n g l e B o o k
A Disney classic-go see.
N o w h e r e T o Run
Jean-Claude Van Damme ('muscles
from Brussles') and Rosanna
Arquette star in a film about nothing
really worth mentioning. I enjoyed
it though.
