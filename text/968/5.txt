Shoot your dog
As an innocent girl from a quiet city
in Kent, I had a lot to get used to
when I arrived, fresh-faced and
wide-eyed in London. I think I
adjusted fairly well to the blatant
prostitutes' cards, the tourists and
the dive-bombing pigeons, but one
aspect of Londoners makes me
shudder to this day. Call me naive,
call me immature, but I will never
come to terms with the local dogs.
My question is—what do people
get out of these creatures, these
strange half-rat half-gerbil mutants?
Why do they feel the need to walk
around connected to a yapping ball
of smelly fluff by a garishly
coloured extensible umbilical cord?
The only concrete conclusion about
the psychological reasons for doing
this is that it can't be anything to do
with sex, since as far as I knew
Freud never said anything about it.
What, then, is the urge that drives
people to keep a pekinese, a poodle
or any other of the multitude of toy
dogs whose names I forget
(hereafter to be referred to as 'rats'
for simplicity)? Well, it must be
pretty strong, because in my time
The last of my exams. The last of
my exams! No more toiling over
textbooks and making excuses to
watch 'Good Morning with Anne
and Nick', soon Hyde Park and The
Camden Palace would be mine! Just
the slight impediment of a statistics
exam standing in my way. Well,
towering in my way, a black jungle
clad mountain, writhing with alien
creatures supping on bitter life and
shrieking insane anthems across the
surrounding plains.
In short, I knew only one statistic,
and that was that I was probably
going to fail.
'Don't worry man,' says Bruce
outside the exam hall. 'You can
work out the chances of pulling a
blue ball from a bag can't you?' I
nod. 'All you need to know.' I ask
Bruce if he has ever heard of
straight line regression. 'Won't
come up.' he says. The Weibull
distribution? Nah. Probability
density functions? 'What, in a
statistics exam?!'.
Hmmm. So Bruce, I'll have to
answer three of four questions about
blue ball selection? 'Well, colours
might vary, they snuck a red one in
last year but the principles are
here I have seen people go to
ridiculous lengths for their pooches.
I have seen a woman with a tricycle
who kept her three rats in the
basket. I have seen a man walk his
rat and have to stop every two paces
to let it catch up. I have seen rats
wearing little mackintoshes, for
heaven's sake. I thought I'd seen
everything until I went to Harrods
and saw a diamond rat collar. Do
people have no shame? Do they not
realise that a creature who has one
inch legs is maybe, just maybe, a
little out of the ordinary? (One
thought I did have, actually, is that
possibly men get a kick out of
owning an animal whose penis is
three quarters the length of its legs.
Butcher than a Rottweiler any
day.).
I am not a heartless woman. I do
not believe that these poor creatures
should be slain. I do believe,
however, that we should register all
canine animals less than six inches
long and make sure that all of them,
except for a few, should be
neutered. The rest should be bred
carefully and used as a reminder of
basically the same.' Okay, at least
I won't be drowning alone I think
to myself.
A girl, who shall remain
nameless (to match the big strip of
black card she always wears over
her face) gave me a sheepish look.
'I'm dead Owain,' she sighed.
'Well, you do look a little dog-
eaten.' Actually, she looked more
like she'd just eaten a dog. Not
some snack sized Pekinese either.
A big meaty cross-breed specially
bred in South East Asia to chew on
school children during the hot
summer months.
'I was up all night, trying to learn
for this fucking exam. Just going
through the notes, again and again.
I didn't even go to bed!' She read
his notes without bursting into a fit
of prolonged sleeping? This girl had
dedication. Or... 'Well, it was the
ProPlus you know, and then I
dropped some speed, and then...'
Suddenly my experiments with
Cadbury's 'Mellow' instant coffee
and a bottle of Diet Coke began to
pale. Maybe I deserved to fail.
'Show time,' says Bruce
enigmatically, and we fde slowly
endlessly into the hall. I shuffle,
head hung low, thinking of Oscar
Wilde in 'The Ballad of Reading
Gaol'. I can almost feel the chains
clanking about my ankles. And the
honours degree with my name on
it disappearing into a huge iron safe
with a metallic thud. Oh well,
there's always the circus.
Sit down. Deep breaths. The hell
with that, just remember to breathe!
I have five minutes reading time so
I watch the lucky songbirds that are
the rest of IC's student populace
strolling in the sun outside.
Somehow I sense that time will not
be a critical factor in this exam. -
'Okay, you can begin', says the
invigilator. 'No!', I want to shout.
You may begin. Whether I can or
not, well that's what the exam is
here for.
I look at the first page and know
I'm doomed. Just row after row of
numbers. Hang on, that's the
tabulated Normal distribution. The
exam proper must be somewhere
underneath. I dive through all my
handy handouts and find an
innocent looking piece of paper
with 'Exam—Duh, Stupid!' written
on it. Was I being paranoid or did
this seem particularly personal?
QUESTION O N E. A young
student, ' M r B ' , has calculated he
spent more time learning to play the
Tibetan nose horn than revising for
his statistics exam. Also, he had
determined his IQ to be exactly 4.5.
(He treasures that 0.5, no rounding
please.) Determine, using any
bloody theorem you choose,
whether M r B has a hope in hell of
passing this exam.
Okay, paranoid delusions. Well,
I had to have something to take my
mind of the task at hand. Answer
three questions. I couldn't even read
three of the questions! Not a blue
ball in sight. I decide to do my best
question first. Two minutes later
I'm onto my worst. Then it's time
to draw M r Potato heads on the
blank pages.
I sit there, doodling away and
wondering whether to cry. A
supervisor places a hand on my
shoulder. 'You're in trouble son,'
he whispers. He looks at M r Potato
head number three. 'You're not
even a gifted artist, shackled by
cruel fate to study here at Science
Headquarters.' Thanks, rub it in.
Into unyielding concrete preferably.
There's only one hope left. I
scrawl all over an empty page—
'There are lies, damned lies, and
statistics.' Then it's off to sleep.
After an hour I awake to the silent
sound of people not writing
everything they know about
statistics onto their answer sheet.
With my head hung low I hand in
my answer script/canvas/pillow. I
slink out. Around me people are
discussing in minutia 'four part c'.
Just come to the Queens Arms
you who I call my friends. There
are Rum and Cokes to be drunk.

I realise that this state of affairs
will not come around for a long
time, until the Government wake up
to what is happening in our capital
city. Until then, I shall attempt to
treat the poor unfortunate animals
with the respect they deserve. I shall
not swear as I am trapped behind
two on a narrow pavement, I shall
not laugh at their owners—and
above all, I shall not snigger at the
story of the inquisitive rat that got
sucked up in a street-cleaning
machine. Well, not much.
