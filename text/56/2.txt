P R O F I L E
ALISON
ENTWISTLE
The President of Imperial College Women's Association
likes to consider herself a Londoner, f o r although born in
St. Helens, Lancashire she could not stand the northern
accents for more than the f i r s t year of her l i f e . She finds
much to her annoyance, that her family takes her scholastic
successes f o r granted, f o r her s i s t e r i s a chemist and her
brother a physicist, which explains why Alison i s a Mathe-
matician. Her father was a minister of r e l i g i o n , but we
have too l i t t l e space to explain Alison's own complex views
on religion here.
Alison's education was Li a normal g i r l s ' school,
where they thought her b r i l l i a n t . They gave her no choice
as to which college to attend, bringing her streak of
obstinacy to the fore by t e l l i n g her she would never get a
place at I.C. Alison triumphed with a State Scholarship
and i s now vrell installed i n her f i n a l year.
Apart from organising the a f f a i r s of ICY/A, Alison
remains one of :
he few members "^wrtl&ve represented I.C.
i n a l l the possible wcraen's te>ms - although she admits she
only really enjoys playing tennis.
In spite of her size, Alison i s a keen mountaineer and
in past years has been a c y c l i s t over large areas of England
and Ireland. This summer however she found a more exciting
form of transport i n Sweden. She spent several weeks
taking the tops off strawberries and picking bad peas o f f
a conveyor beit,'in order to earn enough money BO hitch-
hike to Stockholm, although this necessitated s i t t i n g on
lorry driver's knees. One of the few words Alison learned
was the Swedish for 'no'.
Alison's artistic gifts range from the care of one ivy
plant which she i s training along a crack i n her hostel room
wall, to a love of music, particularly piano music. She
has had seven years tuition in piano playing and can occa-
sionally be heard in the early hours of the morning bashing
duets on the gym piano.
When asked for some likes and dislikes our President
told us that when young the way to gain her attention was
to sit on a plate and make a noise like a chocolate biscuit.
Though this delicacy i s s t i l l a favourite we find that she
.also likes collecting things, the most notable being a
collection of teaspoons gathered, honestly, from many parts
of Britain and the Continent. These are stock equipment
for a l l ICVfA coffee parties. Among her other l i k e s we have
crumpets, corncobs, astronomy (looking at stars - alone),
bridge (in an amateur fashion) and some men. W
e found she
ha3 indifferences including politics, mathematics and some
men. Her dislikes are chiefly intolerance and propoganda,
marmalade, people who smoke in buses, and some other men.
The President of the most select group in the college is
an interesting and amusing person, though always funniest
when she does not mean to be. W
e can also proudly say that
Alison i s respectable - at least we thought so u n t i l we
discovered her knitting a baby's cardigan and the presence
of a pram in' the corridor outside her room. However this
was satisfactorily explained by the pram belonging to the
Dramatic Society and the cardigan was for Alison's niece.
W
e heaved a sigh of relief - or was i t disappointment?
HEIGH HO!
What would you do
If you were me?
I can't remember
My A.B.C.
Just keep an smoking the whole day long.
Fluid flow's bad,
Heat transfer's worse,
I daren't write down
What I think in verse
Looks like I ' l l f a i l my exams again.
I'm fed up with l i f e .
And scared of death,
I've run out of paper
And run out of breath.
Reckon I ' l l go and have another drink.
TEAPOT.
HOW TO GET RICH QUICK"
by
rt Blank Squiggle
Perhaps, you may say, money grows on gooseberry
bushes. Well, l e t me assure you, i t most c e r t a i n -
l y does not.
However, there are one o r two ways i n whioh
le lucre (as the French say) may be obtained at a
s l i g h t discount. These ways f a l l i n t o two c l a s s -
es :-
1. Class F. Methods by which money i s actual-
l y made,
2. Class S. Methods by which one's petty cash
r i s e s by not spending what one already has. I t i s
possible to prove, however, that i f one has an am-
ount of money x, and Class S. i s employed, the tot-
a l r e s u l t a n t cash stock being TL,
x 4 x,
whereas the desired r e s u l t i s
x »> x
We s h a l l , therefore, discount Class S. as
u . f . f . u . , or "useless f o r f u r t h e r use".
Class F. may be divided into (a) Manufactur-
ing processes, and (b) Recovery processes.
P. (a)(1) The d i r e c t manufacture process:
For t h i s you w i l l need a couple o f panteoh-
nicons, an i s l a n d i n the A t l a n t i c , a p r i v a t e army,
a motor c r u i s e r , a papermill o r s i l v e r mine, (we
discount copper as not l u c r a t i v e enough) and a few
other odds and ends which you can pick up i n Wool-
worth's or L e s l i e ' s . The idea i s to borrow the
c o i n presses i n the Royal Mint, ship them t o your
i s l a n d and get to work. A small bribe should fix
i t with the o f f i o i a l s concerned.
P. (a) (11) Expansion process :
The essence of this method i s to cut each coin
neatxy i n two edgeways. Now cut away the centre
and f i l l the gap with glue to hold the coin togeth-
er again. Apply method (1) to the coin-metal gain-
ed, o r s e l l to other dealers f o r a small fee.
Now we come to the recovery processes. These
f a l l i n t o two olasses : -
F.(b) (1) Dishonest methods :
These are by f a r the most moneymaking, but are
frowned upon by the constable;
F. (b) (11) S l i g h t l y honest methods ;
These include
F. (b) (11) A. Horse-race b e t t i n g . For this you
w i l l need ( i ) a horse-race, ( i i ) some c a p i t a l ,
( i i i ) no sense, ( i v ) a p i n . There are several
text books on the subject, so I s h a l l not enter
into great d e t a i l . S u f f i c e i t to say that, pro-
v i d e d you use the'pin s e n s i b l y , you cannot lose.
P. (b) ( i i ) B,. F o o t b a l l "pools". A c l e v e r idea.
You cannot lose (see MoGugglebreck: "The Luck of
the Pools, Waddle & Turnback, Is.). One thing,
though — y o u w i l l have to j o i n the F o o t b a l l Pool
Promoter's A s s o c i a t i o n .
P. (b) ( i i ) C . Crown & Anchor. This i s another good
way i f you can a f f o r d tne b i t s and pieces. Mak-
ing 14s. per hour i s not hard, provided you are the
banker. Be c a r e f u l ! Keep your cash i n your pocket
and wear a b e l t and braces, otherwise the weight of
your winnings may be g i v e n away to the other play-
ers. A l t e r n a t i v e l y , you may take a wheelbarrow.
That completes the l i s t . I t r u s t that you
now have no f e a r s about what w i l l happen when you
get thrown out o f I.C.
