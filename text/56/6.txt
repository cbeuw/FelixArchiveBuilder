6 FELIX
f P i l T
U.L.RUGBY CUP 2nd ROUND
Westminster College 6 pts. Imperial College 9 pts.
This time the College XV really began like cup-
holders. The Westminster defence was severely
tested when Ferris made a well-judged diagonal punt
ahead, and again when Spooner ran strongly on the
right wing. There was no early score, but after
twenty minutes some fast, accurate passing by the
back line brought the ball to Palmer with room to
run, and be crossed i n the corner for an excellent
try. Further attacks included a passing movement
by the forwards from a lineout, completed by a kick
to the corner flag; but this effort was stopped by
the half-time whistle. Soon after tbe interval,
from a heel on the Westminster '25' Holnan cut
through i n splendid style and handed on to Jones
and Palmer for the latter to score again. Then
Lewis, who had been just short with the two conver-
sions, kicked a penalty goal to make i t 9-0. At
this stage a thick mist began to blot out the f i e l d
and the play became only intermittently v i s i b l e .
The touch-line theory that I.C. were coasting com-
fortably home was rudely shaken by two penalty goals
to Westminster froa quite unnecessary infringements.
With ten minutes l e f t anything could have happened
in such strange conditions, but fortunately the
forwards monopolised the ball from a series of line-
outs, and regained control of the proceedings.
This was a greatly improved performance,
although the team i s s t i l l slow to seize on defensive
fumbles, and more variety i n attack would turn scor-
ing potential into points. Tha backs were well-
served by Pontin and handled e f f i c i e n t l y . The
forwards, though sometimes ragged i n the loose scrums,
generally held the upper hand and won a satisfactory
share of the b a l l .

C U P R U N E N D E D
After a record breaking season last year, most of the
stalwarts of the Squash Club disbursed to far corners of
the globe; leaving the Club practically devoid of exper-
ienced players. Although a number of good clas3 freshmen
Joined iur ranks there were no"windfalls" oomparable to
•that of last year and aa a result, i t was realised that
the role of the club would be to maintain the fixtures and
build up a fresh team i n the hope of another record season
later on.
So far this term both teams have won several matches
and lost rather more, but a l l have been well fought and
thoroughly enjoyed. Unfortunately, in common with a number
of other I.C. clubs, our hold on the U.L. Cup was relin-
quished i n the f i r s t round.
The club i s evidently as popular as ever this year;
this being shown by the very large entry of 46 for the
Whiteley Cup tournament and the fact that a l l coaching
dates for the term had been fully booked within the first
week.
Finally, the Club would like to pat i t s tribute to
that 'Grand Old Man* of squash, Jeff Kenyon, who left I.C.
for Africa earlier this month. Jeff, had captained the Club
twioe, won the Whiteley cup six years running, played as the
College first string for the same number of years and add-
ed greatly to the prestige of the Club and College by his
sportsmanship. Thank you, Jeff.
Cross-Country Club
The bad start to the season is gradually being recti-
fied. We have now beaten Keble College, Oxon.,Queen Mary
College and Exeter University i n first team matches,
although we have lost to Walton A.C., IJ.II.A. Sandhurst,
and Reading and Southampton Universities.
The 'A* and second teams havu done better having
a 60j£ record of .success.
Individually, Pain and Bailey have been U.L. first
team regulars. Norman Huxford, our captain has been running
well a l l season, but special mention must be made of
Allnatt, whose improvement of form over last year has
amazed us a l l .
We must await the U.L. Championships next Saturday -
12th December.
SHOOTING
Again this season, despite strong efforts to
avoid i t , none of the I.C. teams shot well at
f i r s t . But the Lady Fortune has been on our side,
and despite low scores, 8 of the 9 matches whose
results are published have been won, and the other
tied.
In the Inter-Varsity League, I.C. "A" heads the
table with 2 wins i n 2 matches, although not
leading on aggregate score. This may be put right
with the next score-sheet, however, for i n i t s 3rd.
match the "A" team obtained the record score of 790
out of a possible 800; a great credit to a l l con-
cerned. Without detracting from personal glory,
this score i s a gratifying result of the recent
purchase of 2 f i r s t - c l a s s target r i f l e s for the uee
of the more s k i l l e d shots.
The "B" team beat Birmingham "B", but tied with
Durham "B" and so must look to their laurels i n the
2nd. Division. A l l three I.C. teams i n the U.L.
League have won their f i r s t round matches.
On Wednesday 25th November, I.C.R.C. was at
home to the Metropolitan Police 1st. Ten, who were
narrowly beaten after an excellent match. Later,
over beer and sandwiches, the v i s i t i n g Captain
presented a silver spoon to 1.11. Abbott, who had
made the highest score (a "possible") on the I.C.
side. The evening eventually came to a reluctant
close amid arrangements for a return match i n May.
Amid the spate of matches, club competitions
continue as usual, and It bodes well for future
years that a number of new members are showing
promise. The Club Championship, Freshers' Handi-
cap, P i s t o l Championship, and other annual compe-
titions w i l l be shot next term; the Annual Dinner
w i l l be held on Thursday 25th. Maroh.
IAE.S.EE
Your announcement last week about two new
Social Clubs to be set up i n I.C. have inspired a
group of Miners to set up an organisation which,
though i t cannot by any stretch of the imagination
be included under the Social Clubs, dv'je perfo.rn a
function very similar to, and i n fact much more
fundamental than that performed by any of the others.
This i s provisionally named the Inter-Collegiate
Association for the Exchange of Students for Social
Functions. It i s not yet known i f any of the other
Colleges would co-operate, but there i e no reason
why they should. In that event, i t will be renamed
the I.C. Association . . . e t c . As readers w i l l no
doubt have guessed by now, this exchange i s limited
to female students only. It i e modelled on tha
excellent International Association for the Exchange
of Students for Technical Experience, which has been
of so much use to I.C. students. Run along the
same lines, i t w i l l have similar regulations and a
comparable standard of efficiency, which means i t
w i l l be very efficient.
Students need partners for various reasons:
one which i s excellent for a Bridge party might not
be quite the type to be invited to a 21st birthday
celebration. One to whom you might enjoy reading
Keats' (or for that matter your own) poetry would
not be very suitable a partner for a Carnival, and
so on. What we propose to do i s to set up a
Register of names and details of several people.
Just the same as the Vacation Work scheme, one will
have to pay a small registration fee. After a
while, both of the parties concerned will make
reports on each other, and these will be added to
the f i l e s .
This of course i s only the germ of the idea,
and considerable research and organisation w i l l
have to be done before anything definite can happen.
We need helpers to take this plan a stage further,
and would invite any of your readers to contact us
for details. A l l information, of course, remains
secret.
Please address a l l letters to the Eon. S e c ,
I.A.E.F.F.S., via the Union Rack. A l l letters will
not be promptly dealt with, though some might be.
The President's decision will be final in a l l cases.
Editor's Note: We found this i n the Rack, with no
signature or any indication of the identity of the
author. Even i f i t was indicated, though, he (we
presume that I.C.W.A. members will not do anything
of this nature, the sweet l i t t l e souls!) would wish to
remain anonymous i n any case. FELIX Kill'welcome any
more information on the progress of this scheme.
