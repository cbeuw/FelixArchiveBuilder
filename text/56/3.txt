COMPETITION RESULTS
Nobody - but nobody - submitted an entry f o r
the I d e a l Dinner competition announced i n the
l a s t i s s u e of FELIX, and n a t u r a l l y there are
no r e s u l t s to announce. The E d i t o r c o n s i d e r s i t
a v i n d i e a t i o n of n i s v i e w s , e x p r e s s e d l a s t
year i n an unpublished viewpoint, that people i n
I.C. do not c a r e a h i t f o r t h e i r p a l a t e s , and
therefore deserve the t a s t e l e s s food they used
to get i n the R e f e c t o r y . Perhaps you cannot a f -
f o r d very good food i n r e s t a u r a n t s ; but at l e a s t
dreaming up a good meal should not be t o o d i f f i -
c u l t f o r i n t e l l i g e n t people who boast of a U n i -
v e r s i t y education, developed t a s t e s , and a l l t h e
r e s t of i t . Be that as i t may, l e t us go on to
the next Competition.
T h i s was the L i m e r i c k Competiibion announced
on the Dance t i c k e t , where two l i n e s o f a l i m e -
riok were given and you were asked to f i n i s h i t .
The p r e l i m i n a r y s o r t i n g o u t was done while the"
Dance p e o p l e were b u s y l o o k i n g a t the f i l m show.
The reduced entry was then f u r t h e r s c r u t i n i s e d
by a panel under a s l i g h t m e n t a l fog, and a v e r y
much reduced number - 5 t o be exact - was then
read out by the r e s p e c t i v e p o e t s to t h e a u d i e n c e .
( T n i s was necessary b e c a u s e t h e E d i t o r r e f u s e d
to read out two o f them, and a l s o b e c a u s e i t was
b e t t e r from the c o m p e t i t o r s ' p o i n t o f v i e w . )
A u d i e n c e a p p l a u s e was made t h e b a s i s f o r t h e
f i n a l d e c i s i o n , and i t u n m i s t a k a b l y s e l e c t e d

Last Tuesday evening a party of a dozen
Guildsmen found themselves i n the Bar of Univer-
s i t y College with the i n t e n t i o n of enjoying what
had been b i l l e d as a " J o i n t Smoking Concert".
This was the f i r s t venture of i t s kind and was an
attempt by the Engineering S o c i e t i e s of Kings,
Q.M.C., U.C. and Guilds to bring about c l o s e r con-
t a c t berween t h e i r members. U.C. offered t o be
the hosts at the f i r s t o f what i s hoped w i l l t u r n
out to he an annual event. Unhappily, as a Smok-
ing Concert, the event was a f a i l u r e since nothing
had been done to organise any form of entertainment
other than a supply of beer (not f r e e , but much
cheaper than at I.C.) and a piano. The evening
degenerated i n t o a beery sing-song whose only merit
lay i n the large r e p e r t o i r e that i s forthcoming
when the experts of four colleges get together.
The h i g h l i g h t of the evening was a s p i r i t e d ren-
dering of the escapades of D.E. Dick, and Others -
a rare enough event these days. Five minutes
before c l o s i n g time the handful of Guildsmen l e f t
showed the others how a College Y e l l should be
done and the evening came to a c l o s e .
It i s hoped that next year, Guilds w i l l be
the hosts and perhaps then we w i l l have a Smoking
Concert.

Enter Hamlet. (Goes to the mirror.
To shave, or not to shave, - that i s the question:-
Whether ' t i s nobler i n the mind to suffer
The stings and harrows of outrageous blades,
Or to take no arms against a sea of whiskers,
And by growing end them? - To brush - to shave -
No more; and by a beard to say we end
The skin-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh i s heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To brush - to shave; -
To shave.' perchance to out: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sweep of blade what screams may come,
When we shuffle o f f this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: ....
....who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat~uh5er a weary"razor,
But that the dread of something after beard, -
The undiscover'd country, .. puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those i l l s we have
Than f l y to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of complexion
Is s i c k l i e d o'er with the pale cast of soap;
(Does so.
And enterprises of great p i t h and moment,
With t h i s regard, t h e i r currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action. - O

EXPERIENCE
I was enjoying my d a i l y a p e r i t i f of Harpic and Orange
in the l i t t l e Comer seat that I usually occupy at Sarspa-
r e l l a ' s Spaghetti Emporium, my thoughts were elsevhere,
winging away i n the great beyond, i n the lofty plane of the
upper mind, the imagination.
Then Lola came into my l i f e .
No words can describe Lola. She was just magnificent,
as she slunk seductively towards me, her hips swinging with
that smooth, sophisticated, rhythmic motion, I knew that I
was experiencing scmething new, something daringly different.
My hand trembled, my mouth went dry, my heart ceased to beat;
I was her slave completely and there was nothing I could do
about i t . She was not blonde, or raven haired, or even a
brunette; she was a dazzling, vivacious, enchanting red-
head. Her eyes were large and limpid, i n t e l l i g e n t eyes
set as a p a i r of jewels i n the heart shaped frame of her
face. She was slim; and she was sleek; her legs were
long and well proportioned, and v/ith every movement you
experienced v i r i l i t y - v i r i l i t y - v i r i l i t y Her whole
demeanour gave you a sense of the jungle, a sense of primi-
tive force which at a moments notice would buisst out to
throw aside the cloak of c i v i l i z e d respectability whioh now
concealed her character. And yet you f e l t you wanted to
take her into your arms and caress her, and to whisper
sweet nothings into her ear whilst she stroked up against
your cheek.
I have since bought Lola and I intend exhibiting her
at next year's Crystal Cat Show.
