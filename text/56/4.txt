LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
S i r ,
Members o f t h i s department were curious to see
the " F e l i x Poster" displayed i n the Onion which
shows F e l i x i n the company of a r e a l l y b e a u t i f u l
"ginger" lady.
You w i l l be i n t e r e s t e d to know, S i r , that the
orange/yellow coat colour i n oats i s a sex-linked
oharacter. Sex-linked characters show up much
more frequently i n the heterogametic sex than i n
the homogametic sex. In mammals, the heterogamet-
i c sex i s the male. * ^
Therefore, i n choosing a "ginger" lady f r i e n d ,
F e l i x has, once again, shown exoellent taste and an
i n t e r e s t i n what i s out of the ordinary.
Should F e l i x be thinking of engagement and
p o s s i b l e marriage, I f e e l he should be p r i v a t e l y i n -
s t r u c t e d that he may expect "ginger" sons and " t o r t -
o i s e " daughters. - 4 - ^ ^ ^ .

Yours t r u l y ,

Dear S i r ,
I should l i k e to enquire why the R.C.S.
Interplanetary Sooiety found i t neoessary to go to
the moon to g a i n the benefits of nights a mere
twenty«eight days long, when i t i s w e l l known to
students of epic poetry that, merely by t r a v e l l i n g
to a not-so-remote part of t h i s earth, nights s i x
months long oan r e a d i l y be e^jerienoed.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y

An Isobutane sadly said
Nodding his isomeric head,
• It's really time that I wed,
But who?
He searched i n vain for a beauty queen,
Then metanormal butylene,
Unsaturated, poor and mean
She'll do.*
He pursued her with a l l haste
He the handsome, she the chaste,
They hadn't any time to waste
These two.
And now you'll find him and his mate,
• i Mr. and Mrs. Alkylate
i, Homologously intimate ,
And true. / J ^ J.S.O.

Dear Sir,
The R.C.S. has made up its mind. We do not intend to
participate in a Morphy Day Rag. In the past few years the
Rags have developed into vulgar brawls, as witnessed in the
R.C.S. building this year after the mobs had returned to
South Ken., and i t i s felt that i f a Rag i s desirable a more
suitable day could be chosen.
This year the R.C.S. assembled on the towpath to support
the Morphy and Lowry crews and for no other reason. You,
Sir, obviously regard the races of minor importance and
suggest that i t i s only the Rags on which the success or
failure of Morphy Day depends. The R.C.S. Boat Club cap-
tain appealed to a Union Meeting for support of his crews
and this he got with very pleasing results which made i t a
very successful Morphy Day as f a r as the R.C.S. was con-
cerned.
Unfortunately your Editorial attacked me personally
and I should like to point out how unfair you were in your
comments. Because of my association with the Soccer Club
my loyalties on that day were regretably divided. As
President of R.C.S. I should have liked to have given vocal
support to the R.C.S. crews but as Captain of the R.C.S.A.F.C.
I honestly thought that my presence on the Soccer field was
more urgently required. The results proved my case. Many
other R.C.S. Union officials were in the same predicament as
myself and they too decided to support their respective Clubs.
The attitude of the R.C.S. on the question of the Morphy
Day Rag must not be misconstrued as a general attack on a l l
forms of Rags. This is definitely not so. We hope to take
part in some, well conducted, good humoured, Rags in the
future and, indeed, correspondence to this effect has been
exchanged between the President of Guilds and myself.
Tours Sincerely,
J. Anderson.
Whisky Song
The Lecturer stood in the theatre,
But the benches were barren and cold,
For Christmas had came to the college,
And students had left for the fold.
The Lecturer went to the Staff room.
It also was chilly and bare.
But there was a bottle of whisky.'
- Having a nap in a chair.
The Lecturer woke up the whisky,
He'd never drunk any before.
He quaffed this fortified spirit
And tumbled inert to the floor.
They found his corpse next half session,
The moon was then at the f u l l .
And the moral derived from this story,
Is to wear* socks of cotton - not wool.
J.V.B.
