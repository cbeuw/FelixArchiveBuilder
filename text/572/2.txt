Dear Steve
W i t h reference to the letter
concerning maths staff in the
Christmas issue of F E L I X .
O u r feelings on reading this
letter were ones of shock — as 'a
bolt out of the blue' doesn't go
hallway to describing the surprise
of this attack — and disgust at
this unsigned display of back-
stabbing. T h e many other maths
students with whom we have
discussed this letter feel similarly.
If this person is dissatisfied
w i t h D r P i t m a n ' s t e a c h i n g ,
he/she should first have done at
least one of the following:
1 Seen D r Pitman himself.
2 Seen the Senior Tutor in
maths.
3 Seen his/her academic rep
and had his/her grievance aired
at staff/student committee.
H a d all these failed to achieve
anything, we still feel that an
anonymous letter to F E L I X is not a
reasonable course of action.
Various people, students and
staff, h a v e w o r k e d h a r d to
i m p r o v e relations w i t h i n the
maths department. These rela-
tions are in general good and we
realise that if they deteriorate, it
is the students who will lose out
most.
We hope that if there is any
hard feeling within the staff at
the moment, it will be dispelled.

Ed's Note
I printed the letter originally
b e c a u s e I t h o u g h t it was a
pleasant change for someone to
actually have the courage of his
convictions and sign the letter ( K
B a r r y ) . T o the best o f m y
k n o w l e d g e the l e t t e r wasn't
anonymous. I was not to know
that there was no such person in
C o l l e g e . I especially d i d not
know, as M r Booty pointed out to
me as if I were an ignoramus,
that K Barry was a member of
the I R A . W h y , the snivelling
little pratt!
M a r k you me, if he should
bring another little offering in. 1
shall squeeze his testicles to a
pulp.
Y o u c a n have faith i n me
Mike, Kirsten and M a r y , saviours
of all that is decent.
Dear Sir
M a n y p e o p l e r e a d i n g the
letters in the last issue of F E L I X
may have concluded that five of
the l e t t e r s o r i g i n a t e d f r o m
members of the I R A , four of
whom were dead.
From personal experience I
can say that these people are not
in the I R A . I think it would be a
bad habit for F E L I X to publish
so m a n y letters u n d e r false
names. I hope this w i l l soon
cease.

Dear Steve
It has been brought to my
attention that in F E L I X 570
(page 3), you have contravened
S e c t i o n 2 ( i ) o f t h e F E L I X
C o n s t i t u t i o n " t o express the
v i e w s a n d o p i n i o n s o f t h e
students of I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e ,
both individually and collectively,
i.e. in terms of decision reached
at U n i o n General Meetings . . ."
In the U G M report in F E L I X
570 y o u have d i s t o r t e d the
motion passed on the F E L I X
Editor, and as such, I must ask
you to print a true and accurate
report of that meeting. I hope
that you take note of the motion
which was passed overwhelm-
ingly at a U G M and will i n
future publish F E L I X inaccord-
ance with its constitution.
Failure to do so will, I a m sure,
result in further action.
Tours sincerely

Y o u r accusation is a disgrace to
your office, sir!
I challenge you to point out
any falsehood in the U G M report
featured in F E L I X 570.

everyone who helped make the

Dear Mr Marshall
Miss Snee writes in F E L I X
571 that she was surprised that
Security think she has the key to
the J C R Cleaning Cupboard.
I base my thinking on the fact
I hat some eight weeks ago, on her
request I gave her the key.
Two weeks later in the Ante
Room, Sherfield Building, I told
her the key h a d not been
returned. She said it had been
given to a third party but she
would make sure it was returned
It never was. Since that time all
requests for the key have been
referred to Miss Snee.
I wonder has Miss Snee lost
her memory, the key or both?

Sir
The current campaign that is
about to take place in the pages
of F E L I X concerning ^he next
Chancellor of the University of
London is disgraceful.
H o w could any sane person
have the temerity and insensi-
b i l i t y to o p p o s e H e r R o y a l
Highness M r s Anne Phillips for
this post? What worse, one of the
candidates is that leftic J a c k
Jones, an e x - T U C hack who isn't
even a member of the House of
Lords. It wouldn't be so bad if it
were L o r d V i c of the Feather, or
even Viscount Scargill.
Excluding the fact that she will
not be as good a chancellor as her
G r a n d m o t h e r w o u l d be at
showjumping, and that she is
married to a stammering imbecile,
there is no lawful impediment
why she should not be honoured
in that way.
O f course, the strain of being
in such a position is such that
only royalty, or myself could bare
it, so I shall end this passionate
plea for Princess A n n e to be
elected by adopting a phrase that
was first aimed at Sen Muskie
when he lost a primary in the
1972 U S E l e c t i o n s " V o t e for
Anne, or she'll c r y " .
