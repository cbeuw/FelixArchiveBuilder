Rag Conference
Held At IC
ICU were the hosts of the 1980 Rag Conference during the
Christmas vacation. Unfortunately, the FELIX man on the spot,
B B Wolffe, was called away on urgent business and so was
unable to write a report. Nevertheless, FELIX presents the
following report:
It was a dark Tuesday afternoon on December 16, as delegates from
all over Britain, and from H e m e l Hempstead, converged on Imperial
College to confer on the popular subject of R a g .
D u r i n g the two and a half hour registration period Barney M c C a b e ,
R C S U pianist, P W P resident comedian and contender for a post as
U n i o n bar cleaner next year was to be seen frantically organising in a
last minute dash. However, the delegates were ready in line for a super
slap up Mooney dinner, which lasted for exactly one hour. T h e n there
followed " d r i n k i n g " in the U n i o n Bar, from which several delegates
were forcibly ejected, and others left of their own accord, bitterly
complaining about the high price of beer, and the capitalist thugs who
impose such prices.
Dogs Attack Delegates
Unfortunately whilst returning from the U n i o n Bar to Southside,
where the guests were accommodated in the most luxurious of
surroundings, two delegates were attacked by a pack of dogs, which
had been roaming Exhibition R o a d . T h e people were rushed to
hospital, but the dogs refused to go.
Wednesday was a glorious day when the sun shone, the wind blew,
and the rain rained it) that order. After a one and a half hour Mooney
breakfast, the delegates were introduced and simultaneously heard a
meditation on R a g from the Bishop of L o n d o n , the R t R e v d G Ellis.
The Charities Committee then gave a talk on the difference between
the Kaisers left elbow and spoons.
In the afternoon, the delegates who by now included W Rees-Mogg,
were given a very severe talking to by the police, who had broken off a
recording session especially for the occasion. T h e business part of the
day concluded with a talk on publicity, given by a publican. After a
slap-up Mooney meal, including T H E baked mince beef roll, delegates
and L o r d Flowers socialised on a pub crawl around some local
drinking houses.
Food Poisoning
Thursday began with a talk on " E v e r y t h i n g you've always wanted
to krrbw about M c M i l l a n and G r a h a m . . . and alternatives, but were
too frightened to ask". This was so scandalous that I refuse to lower the
tone of the article by enlarging on it.
After lunch, delegates paid a visit to the sales, and bought or
shoplifted assorted articles of clothing, and beer glasses.
T h e R a g Conference Revue, scheduled for that evening was
cancelled, owing to all participants having food poisoning. A n extra
item, however, was added to the programme, L o r d Denning spoke on
the interpretation of the L a w with respect to R a g Magazines from
1808, when he got his First Class Maths Degree, to the present day.
O n Friday morning a discussion was held on C R I B , which I think
means C r i m i n a l Research and Information Bureau, and seems a silly
thing to talk about.
T h e conference ended on a happy note as M r Mooney handed out
special " V i c ' l l F i x It" badges.
I have been unable to research fully what the delegates had for
breakfast, as the Breakfast Bar ladies can't understand any English
except "sausages". C a p t a i n Lindley was asked how many delegates
were at the conference but said " I don't know, I don't stand and count
'em, and it's not up to me to count 'em either".
Rag Chairman Dead
Ian Hodgeson, this year's R a g C h a i r m a n wouldn't know anything
H E W A S N ' T E V E N T H E R E ! (Neither was Sir James Goldsmith
whose news magazine ' N o w ! ' certainly is a rag). W h e n Barney
M c C a b e realised that the conference was a total flop and would
seriously damage his chances of becoming U n i o n Bar Cleaner next
year, he said: " I don't know what I'll do, I think I'll stand for I C U
Deputy President".
Some of this report may be true, but the rest of it isn't.
Telephone Extension
I T S E E M S l i k e l y t h a t the
internal phone system will be
extended to Evelyn Gardens in
the very near future. M r Burridge
of the College Estates department
has told F E L I X that the claim
for a tie line has been with the
G P O for a month now, and that
as soon as it is granted it is a
simple matter to hook a phone on
the end.
Initially, only one phone line
w i l l be p r o v i d e d , to B e r n a r d
Sunley House, which will enable
t h e h o u s e k e e p e r of E v e l y n
Gardens to keep in contact with
C o l l e g e . T h e p h o n e w i l l be
situated near the housekeeper's
flat and will be available for the
use of students of all the Evelyn
Gardens houses.
O n a less optimistic front, the
phone system in the Southside
Halls of Residence has still not
been connected to the internal
phone system. This work should
have been completed by the start
of October but the contracted
firm, Reliance, seem less than R e l i -
able. A l l that needs to be done to
complete the system is that one
connection needs to be made
which could be done by College
electricians in a day if it were not
for the fact that such an "irres-
ponsible" action would render
the contracter not liable for any
future fault that might develop.
W h e n connected, there would be
just one internal to Southside
connection (and vice-versa). IC
Radio aim to put this connection
to good use as Southside residents
w o u l d be able to phone the
s t a t i o n d i r e c t l y f r o m t h e i r
l a n d i n g . T h e system m a y be
extended to the other Halls if it
passes satisfactorily.
Iranian
Abomination
T O W A R D S the end of last term
a large number of posters written
in Iranian were stuck on walls
around College and various West
E n d Underground stations with
an extremely strong adhesive.
The poster depicted scenes of
battle w i t h the only E n g l i s h
s c r i p t b e i n g the a d d r e s s o f
Imperial College Union. This is
not the first time this abhorrent
advertising technique has been
used to deface College walls and
shops i n K e n s i n g t o n a n d the
West E n d ; remnants of others
may still be seen etched onto the
walls in Kensington H i g h Street
— all bearing the address of I C
U n i o n i n E n g l i s h . T h e latest
o u t r a g e was b r o u g h t to the
attention of the President. J o h n
P a s s m o r e , by F E L I X a f t e r
discovering one gracing its own
walls. After translation, it was
discovered to advertise an event
staged by I C Iranian Society on
December 13, 1980 in the U n i o n
Building.
A n executive meeting was held
which decided to fine the Iranian
Society £10 for use of adhesive
instead of Blu-tac and the more
s e r i o u s l a c k of a n E n g l i s h
translation; both contraventions
of U n i o n policy. (See Editorial.)
Pressure of
Academic Work
M R P H I L L I P C O L L has re-
signed from his post on the U n i o n
C o u n c i l as E x t e r n a l A f f a i r s
Officer. Phil told J o h n Passmore
of his decision last M o n d a y and
e x p l a i n e d that it was due to
"pressure of academic work".
Labour
on Fees
M R N E I L K I N N O C K , the
opposition spokesman for edu-
c a t i o n has a n n o u n c e d at the
annual conference of the W o r l d
University Service ( W U S ) that
they will be introducing a sliding
s c a l e o f u n i v e r s i t y fees f o r
overseas students i n o r d e r to
protect those from the poorest
backgrounds. H e added that this
system would be introduced as
soon as the L a b o u r Party were
returned to power and that the
scale of fees would be a "steeply
descending order of priority".
Centenary
O N J A N U A R Y 1, the Natural
History M u s e u m celebrated its
100th Anniversary. The museum
began due to an alliance struck
up between Sir R i c h a r d Owen
and M r Gladstone in the earlv
1860s. W i t h M r G l a d s t o n e ' s
s t r o n g s u p p o r t . S i r R i c h a r d
O w e n was a b l e to get t h c i
museum on a firm footing by
1885 with a vast array of modern
animal exhibits to a visitor's left
on entering, fossils and minerals
to the right, and flora at the top.
The musuem is renowned for
its massive collection of insects
and in 1980 was named 'Museumof
the Y e a r ' . T o c e l e b r a t e its
c e n t e n a r y , t h e M u s e u m is
p r e s e n t l y s t a g i n g an e x h i b i t
entitled 'Nature stored, nature
studied' which shows the growth
ol the collection. In M a y , a major
p e r m a n e n t e x h i b i t w i l l be
opened on Darwin's 'Origin of
the Species'. It is perhaps ironical
that the Museum's chief founder,
Sir R i c h a r d O w e n , was a major
opponent of Darwin's views.
