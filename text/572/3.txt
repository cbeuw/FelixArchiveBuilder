M o o n e y s h o c k e d
f I went rigidwhen I heard the news3
By our Special Correspondent
A happy New Year was not had by Victor "It tastes as good
coming up as It does coming down" Mooney this year when he
read In The Times of December 31 that his lifelong ambition, a
knighthood had not been granted.
This came as a shock to Royal Arch Freemasonry circles,
especially as "Sir" Victor had recently stored up the best food for
Prince Phillip's visit to stagger him with an eyeball rolling frenzy
of delight resulting In the Press Secretary of the Duke of
Edinburgh Award Scheme congratulating College on having
such a "superb caterer".
It was evident at an early stage that Sir V i c t o r expected such an
honour. W h e n asked in F E L I X on November 28 if he were not a cook
" w h a t would you rather be?", he said: " O h something like S I R Francis
Chichester".
The honours list came as a shock to many I C students as well. M a n y
of them have been eating Mooneys for several years now, comforting
themselves with the thought that, emaciated sick and undernourished
as they were, their suffering was not in vain, a n d that by supporting
this truly great m a n in such a way they could at least feel proud when
he assumed his rightful title — " S i r " Victor. It has been suggested that
all profits from refectories this year should go to the Conservative
B o a r d of F i n a n c e (under the a d m i n i s t r a t i o n of M a j o r - G e n e r a l
Wyldbore-Smith C B , D S O , O B E — the O B E costing as little as
£7,000, incidentally) in order to prevent the same thing happening
next year.

£ N o se ha intoxicado nadie con
esta bazofia, Signor Mooney?"
W h e n F E L I X sent its ace polyglottal reporter, B B VVolffe, to find out
how the Breakfast Bar staff felt about their supremo not being honoured,
he asked " t P o r que no alquilan u n cocinero en lugar de un pinche para
haccr l a c o m i d a ? " only to rccieve the inevitable repost " V a y a
usted a escupir a otra parte". (It is thrilling to be under such a man.)
Victor Mooney's catering career started on Joe's stall in the M i l e
End R o a d in 1948. H e won fame as the Catering Chief at the Selsdon
Park Hotel a n d later at the St James Court Hotel, before he moved to
the G r a n d Hotel (Harrogate). Shortly after coming to I C he won the
G u i l d of Catering Managers Merit A w a r d as Caterer of the Year in
1957. Although IC's catering has degenerated into a disgusting state
since he came here, he has kept his reputation as a mild mannered
buffoon, always maintaining a strict "dignified silence'' when criticised
in the pages of F E L I X . Nevertheless his kitchens, even though they
contravene Sections 12 to 37 of the Public Health Act \9~T can
produce upside down cakes, chilli con carne with rice, sponge pudding
with raspberry jam, cucumber sandwiches, and even 1 H 1 . baked
mince beef rool; that are truly fit for the M o n a r c h y . T h e was in which
Sir V i c t o r has "buttered-up" [a culinary term] members ol the Ro\al
Family; notably Prince Phillip the Greek (who receives the best food,
whilst students a n d the stall, who are charged V A T . pa> through the
nose to subsidise people rich enough to pay at the check out and tat
enough already to stuff themselves silly) should surely have been
enough to tilt the balance in his favour.
F E L I X contacted Buckingham Palace to enquire if Prince Phillip
paid V A T on his I C meals, as he is not a student, but no information
was available.
The reaction in College to the news ol Sir Victor's lack ol honours
has been varied: M s R a e Snee, BSc, A R C S (a liver the pair" sneered
vindictively. " M o o n e y ? He's about as useful as a one-armed taxi
driver with crabs". M r Steve Marshall BSc, A R C S yconsidciabh
more) said: " I went rigid when I heard the news; it was like a bolt from
the blue".
