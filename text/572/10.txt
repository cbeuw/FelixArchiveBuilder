Nobody solved the chess puzzle (I warned you
it was difficult) and the only person to get the
other three right w a s Roland Marslin,
Physics 3, and he wins a total of £14 in prizes.
Roland was the only person to get Silent Audit
correct; incredibly he solved it without cl
correction slip.
There were several correct replies to the
other two puzzles. Open Fire was won by
Jasper of IC Radio, and Santa Clues by David
Bogle of C h e m Eng. They can collect £2 each
from the F E L I X Office.
Thanks and congratulations to everyone
who entered, and especially to Stephen Harris
and Katharine Herbert who did better than
most, but were unlucky in the draw.
Open Fire
Ten missiles are needed. The diagram shows a
symmetric solution.
As I intended, it's easy to find a solution with
ten missiles, and even easier to convince
yourself it is possible with nine missiles. It isn't.

Prancer drinks Arctic Lite, and Dasher sings
'Hark The Herald Angels Sing'. These are the
only possibilities for the information I asked
for, although it isn't possible to allocate all the

with the reindeer harnessed in this order, with
Dasher at the back, and Prancer at the front.
Kamikaze Chess
Let's start with some basic observations about
the position.
1. Obviously neither side will make any
pawn move.
2. If White moves his black-square bishop,
Black can play B x B check, forcing K - N l , and
now White's position is hopeless.
3. If White moves his rook off the back
rank, Black can move his black-square bishop,
and again White cannot now force Black to do
anything.
4. If White permits (or forces) Black to play
B x B check at any time, he must make sure his
rook is not in a position to block the check.
For instance 1.B-B6 B x B c h is no g o o d ,
because of 2.R-N2.
Putting all this together, we see that White
must shuttle his Bishop up and down the
diagonal, and his rook back and forth along the
back rank (making sure it is always either
behind his bishop, or else o n the 'safe'
square, KR8) until he can force Black to play
B x B mate.
Forming this strategy is the first part of the
problem, and it's no small achievement to do
so; congratulations if you got this far. But
worse is to come, since in deciding the best
tactics, you have to consider what are the best
counter-tactics for Black.
It's done like this:
In the diagram I have put numbers on
certain squares of the board. Black's best play
is as follows.
1. If possible, play B x B without giving mate.
2. If this is not possible, make sure that the
number of vacant squares between the two
white-square bishops is equal to the number of
the square on which the white rook stands.
Black will be able to achieve one of these
aims as soon as (and only if) White makes a
slip.
White's best play is similar.
1. Make sure that the number of vacant
squares between the two white-square bishops
is equal to the number of the square on which
the rook stands.
2. Never move the rook from a lower to a
higher numbered square. This will eventually
force Black to play B x B mate.
All rather complicated, so here are a couple
of examples. In the first, White blunders on his
first move.

This is how it should be done.

Silent Audit
99V2p, 98V2 P, 95V2p, 90y2 p, 50V2 p, V2 p.
Of the four sworded puzzles, this one was
unquestionably the most sworded of a l l ,
although the idea behind it is extremely simple.
The point is that although each monk tendered
£1, they didn't all offer a £1 note. A n d so the
shopkeeper was able to deduce, for instance,
that a monk who offered 50+10+10+10+10+10
pence wanted a candle costing more than 90p.
In fact, the smallest coin tendered defines a
limit to the amount of change expected.
Now, we know they all wanted differently
sized candles, so the shopkeeper could only
make his deductions if the smallest coins
tendered by each of the six were different.
Let us make a table of possibilities:
Smallest Coin Minimum Prize
Tendered
'/2p

So the maximum amount of change the
shopkeeper could possibly have given was
V2+lV2+41
/2+91
/2+491
/2
+
991
/2=£1.65.
But we are told that he did hand out £1.65 in
change. S o the amounts handed in change to
the individual monks were V2P, IV2P. 472P,
9V2 P, 49V2P. and 99V2p which determines the
prices of candles as 99V2P, 98'/2P> 95V2p,
9OV2P. 50V2P, a n d V2P (this l a s t o n e
presumably for a birthday cake).
I hope this is enough of an explanation; it's
by no means as complete as it might be, but to
go into greater detail would be unnecessarily
tedious. But if anyone still doesn't understand,
write to me at the usual address and I'll send
you a really detailed solution.
Also, I hope that everyone got a correction
sheet to say that the amount of change was
£1.65, not £1.66. That mistake cost me my
second consecutive night's sleep, but for such
a lovely puzzle (adapted from a Tantalizer by
Martin Hollis) it was worth it.

The next general meeting of A C C will be
Tuesday, January 13, 1981 in the Bot/Zoo
Common Room. A representative of each
club is required to attend since the main topic
is . . . money.
Keys
Towards the end of last term a key to the new
volleyball court was mislaid. If you know the
whereabouts of this key could you return it to
the Union Office P D Q since its loss could
mean the loss of the court to some users.
Phil's Bit
I need urgently (!) photos of College sports ..
. . swimming, rugby, rowing, squash, etc (not
for FELIX). If yoiu have any, please could you
let me have them via either the FELIX Office,
3M letter-racks or Falmouth 132.
Cheers
