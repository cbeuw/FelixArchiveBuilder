(Eat your heart out I C U . )
This year's Hogmanay celebrations at the
Inebriated Haggis surpassed all records for the
amount of whisky consumed. The five guests
who stayed till the end left in the not-so-early
hours of the morning and sang themselves to
sleep trying to find their way home, all of them
unaware that each was wearing the sporran of
one of the others.
T h e b l a m e for this falls u p o n A n g u s
M c O a t u p , the cloakroom attendant, who is
now trying to sort out who has whose. But he
was as pickled as the rest, and this morning,
deafened by the resounding crash of aspirin on
glass, his brain is stuck in a groove. Still,
through the fog he half remembers that:
McBagpipe is wearing the sporran
of the man who is wearing the sporran
of the man who is wearing the sporran
of McPorridge
and
McThistle is wearing the sporran
of the man who is wearing the sporran
of the man who is wearing the sporran
of the man who is wearing the sporran
of McOchaye
and
McPorridge is wearing the sporran
of the man who is wearing the sporran
of the man who is wearing the sporran
of the man who is wearing the sporran
of McThistle.
and
McLochnessmonster's sporran is not
being worn by McBagpipe.
Alas that one of these four recollections is
untrue!
Who is wearing whose sporran?
Solutions, comments and criticisms to me
c/o FELIX Office. There is a £2 prize for the
first correct entry chosen at 1:00pm on
Wednesday.
If anyone can think of a good way of raising
prize money for the weekly competition, (or
w o u l d like to d o n a t e / b e q u e a t h / c o v e n a n t )
would they let me know, please. (There will be
a prize - Ed.) The obvious way to do this
would be to find a company or small business
w h o w o u l d be prepared to sponsor the
competition in return for the publicity they
would get, so if you know of such a firm, please
get in touch.
Solutions to the Christmas puzzles are on
page 11, together with the winners' names.
Finally, good luck with this week's puzzle.
It's much easier than it looks.
