Amnesty International
Last term the Imperial College Group staged a
twenty-four hour sponsored fast in a successful
effort to raise funds and publicise its aims; the
group would like to thank all those who showed
their support by contributing to our funds,
sponsoring members and buying our Christmas
cards and publications.
This term we are participating in the national
campaign organised by Amnesty concerning the
use of torture by security forces in Chile. Events
in Chile have been highlighted in the British press
with the arrest and torture of Britons Claire Wilson
in July last year, and Dr Sheila Cassidy in 1975.
But what is not generally known is that an
estimated 1,500 Chileans have 'disappeared'
between 1973 and 1977, and that many of these
will have been tortured in secret detention
centres. Hundreds of thousands have been
forced into external exile following the coup of
1973 and dissidents have been banished to
remote parts of the country. By July 1980, the
repression was worse than at any previous time.
However, the present British government has
discounted human rights considerations when it
announced the renewal of diplomatic relations
with Chile last year, and the decision to allow the
resumption of arms sales to that country.
The British Section of Amnesty is planning a
major parliamentary initiative on Chile, which
hopes ot pressure the government into revealing
details of the arms trade with Chile, so that the
public can make its own judgement on the extent
that repression in Chile is supported by Britain.
We urge all concerned people to write to their
MPs asking support for this move, and to sign the
petition protesting against the use of torture,
which is obtainable from R Sloss (Botany P G , int
2096) to be presented to the Chilean amassador
in February.

T H E S T A R T of a new year seems like a good time
to remind you about I C C A G and its activities.
I C C A G stands for Imperial College Community
A c t i o n G r o u p , but, although it may sound
otherwise, we are neither a political nor a religious
group. We are just a small College society whose
aim is to D O something to help some of those in
need in London. For example, every Tuesday and
Friday night, a small group of us (not the same
ones all the time) travels in a minibus to Charing
Cross Bridge to give soup, bread and biscuits to
those sleeping rough there. O n Saturdays a few of
us help at a club for handicapped children and
their friends, while others sometimes help to build
an adventure playground. Some of us are hoping
to go to the homes of old people and fit draught
excluders and other insulation; others have
"adopted" an old person to visit and do shopping
for. At Christmas, in collaboration with Dramsoc,
we arranged a concert in an old people's home,
and the blood transfusion people come to College
twice a year at our request.
Why don't you think about coming along to one
or more of our activities this term? Give us a try
— you can get as little or as much involved as you
like. If you are interested, keep reading the
I C C A G articles in FELIX, or contact Sean Coyle,
Elec Eng 2.

D U R I N G T H E next few weeks the Photographic
Society has two competitions and five lectures.

short lectures by the members on their thing,
such as choosing a camera, flashgun, etc.

H A P P Y C H R I S T M A S (? - Ed) and I hope you are
all being good boys and girls going to your
lectures and getting on with the academic side as
the good old exams are only a few weeks away.
Last term ended in glory with myself battling it
out at Governing Body about IC and Nuclear
Fuel Technology. It was all to no avail however as
all the wise old men of College decided to stand
by their decision of last June to maintain the
course regardless of who did the course, etc. The
other gem at Governing Body was the discussion
document on the pros and cons of independence
from the University of London which was not
discussed but deferred to a future meeting.
Graduate Studies on the Monday after you all
went home had a long discussion about the length
of time it takes research students to do research.
Refectory Committee saw a major argument
between M r Mooney and Estates about Bar
Hoists in the Union and Southside.
Now for the bad news, the External Affairs
Officer post is vacant as Phil Cole has resigned.
Papers are up in the Union Lower Lounge and
anyone interested should see me or Phil Cole to
find out what the job entails.
The other news is that this is normally the time
of year when people decide to stand for
sabbaticals. Already people have voiced their
intentions. If anyone is considering standing for
Hon Sec, D P , or President they should contact
the relevant person and I'm sure those who wish
to edit our illustrious newspaper FELIX have
already spoken to the Greatest Living editor in
England.
