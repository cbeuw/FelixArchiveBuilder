‘Pocket Cinema’ - Short films and where to find them
I was quite excited as I went into the
showing of Solomon Kane. We sat in
the comfortable VIP seats and set-
tled in for an hour and three quarters
of awesome action and maybe some
thoughtful dialogue - after all, the main
theme in the story was supposed to be
one of redemption. What followed
was an orgy of ‘oh-no-he-didn’t’, pre-
asskick, trashtalking interspersed with
hammy expressions of overwrought
guilt and ultimately, a resolution that
just seemed far too easy. I can only
imagine that the aerial shot of Kane
standing, arms wide, legs at shoulder
width, asking of the heavens “What do
you want from me?” was supposed to
be wrenching; it left me unaffected or,
if anything, a bit embarassed for James
Purefoy, the actor in the title role.
Despite all this, there were a few
positives. I enjoyed the way that visu-
al imagery of the scene leading up to
the climax echoed the story’s open-
ing and there is also some pretty good
swordplay in the film. The surround-
ings and visual effects were impressive
given the rather modest $40m budget,
though the appearance of what resem-
bled a Balrog was cause for concern
(while we’re on this subject, I’ve also
seen Gollum where he has no business
Je T’aime le John Wayne
A wonderful little tribute/
spoof of French New Wave
films starring My Family’s Kris
Marshall who models himself
after Jean-Paul Belmondo from
Godard’s Breathless. It’s very
funny, even if you don’t know
what they’re poking fun at.

Miracle Fish
An eight year boy hides from
bullys in the nurse’s office
and wakes to find the school
eerily empty. The films creepy
atmosphere is broken by a nerve-
shattering twist at the climax.
Highly recommended.

French Roast
In this charming animation, an
obnoxious gentleman is taught a
lesson in charity.

Logorama
In a world entirely constructed
of commercial and corporate
logos, an insane Ronald
Mcdonald goes on the rampage
but the Michelin Men police
aren’t far behind. This film is a
beautifully constructed ,surreal
‘hard-boiled’ heist flick and it
won the Oscar for best animated
short. The climax is one of the
craziest I have ever seen.

The Door
Set in the aftermath of the
Chernobyl disaster, a man sneaks
back into his recently evacuated
town to steal the door from his
old apartment in a seemingly
pointless act. A very sombre
film which explores death and
how it affects life with a very
real apocalyptic style. It was
nominated for an Oscar but
unfortunately lost to The New
Tenants.

La maison en Petit Cubes
In this beautifully drawn Oscar
winning animated film, an old
man desperately tries to keep
above his flooded town by
adding floors to his towering
house. After dropping his
favourite pipe, he explores the
submerged building which
brings back tender memories
of his past life. Imagine The
Snowman with an environmental
theme.

Kiwi
Kiwi is a youtube favourite
after being uploaded by the
Vancouver Film School which
has a very large amount of short
films made by its talented pupils
available on Youtube. A very
gentle tale about a humble kiwi
who simply wants to fly with
his stumpy little wings. The
animation is rather crude by
today’s standards but it’s hard
not to shed a tear for the poor
critter at the end.

10 Minutes
A Japanese Tourist waits ten
minutes for his photos to
develop in Rome. Meanwhile
a young boy dodges danger in
the besieged city of Sarajevo
during the Bosnia an War. Over
a period of ten minutes, the
boy experiences terror and
harrowing tragedy whilst the
tourist has the inconvenience of
waiting for his film to develop.
This film will make you reflect
on the hardships people are
suffering at this very minute.

Alive in Joburg
This is a classic example of a
director starting out in the
wonderful medium of shorts.
Alive in Joburg was directed
by Neill Bromkamp and is
essentially the prototype for
District 9. It is interesting
how the original short film
was fleshed out for the Oscar
nominated feature film; all the
ideas are in place including
the alien prawns and the fake
documentary style.

W
ith the never end-
ing onslaught of
Hollywood block-
busters and the
constant barrage
of comedies and dramas thrust in our
direction by advertisements with way
too big budgets, it is very easy to for-
get about the small timers. Short films
are vital for new filmmakers to get in
the business and hone their skills. Ani-
mated shorts are especially important
as the finances required to produce a
feature length film are never small.
Making a short film is still a large
project and is by no means the easy
option. A story must have a beginning,
middle and end and condensing all the
emotions and actions present in a full
feature into a ten minute film requires
a special skill. Films can range from in-
nocent comedies to dark thrillers and
the great thing is you can watch them
during your lunch break.
The Internet holds a vast library of
short films, from Oscar winners to
school projects. Some of these have
been uploaded with the filmmaker’s
consent whereas others have been
naughtily put onto youtube. However
I’m not going to preach about the
ethics of file sharing, instead I have
trawled the World Wide Web in search
of my favourite short films and a few
classics. I recommend Miracle Fish and
Logorama as I swear you won’t have
seen anything like them before and I’ve
given the URL for each film. Enjoy!
being - as a wild mountain boy in the
even-more-dismal The Wolfman). Max
von Sydow’s very brief appearance also
had me cheering inside and I had a nice
‘Hey! It’s that guy!’ moment with Pete
Postlethwaite (Friar Lawrence from
Romeo and Juliet) playing the beautiful
Rachel Hurd-Wood’s father.
All in all, I did enjoy the experience,
though purely for the hilarity; I defi-
nitely recommend this if you like being
able to watch a film, every so often bask
in the glory of dual-wielding swords
and, during the climax, paraphrase
Lord of the Rings, Pokemon and Zero
Wing, though admittedly this is better
done watching the DVD in the comfort
of your own home. If you crave some-
thing with both swords and merit, just
watch Gladiator for the 10th time - it’s
never not awesome.
