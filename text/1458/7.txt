W
hile the election
hype is disappear-
ing amongst eve-
ryone at quite a
rapid rate, for some
people more involved with the whole
thing there is a more notable residue
left. Probably for some, and unfortu-
nately for me, it is partly negative.
I forgot to submit my manifesto to
the elections website. Even though
there is no excuse for that, other than
just completely forgetting because I
sent it to felix (the deadline for which
was 2 days earlier) and Live!, what
happened afterwards really made me
realise that something is not right.
I discovered the absence of the
manifesto 10 minutes before the vot-
ing started, and obviously, the first re-
action was to send an email with the
required stuff attached, apologising
for the late submission. The next day,
I got a reply saying that it had been 4
days past the deadline, hence NO.
However, a remark was also made
saying that “unlike other candidates
whose manifestos was submitted
within 12 hours of the deadline and
were marked late, yours was 4 DAYS
LATE”. Well, the exact citation of the
candidates’ pack is “any manifestos
submitted after the deadline below
will not be published at all”. If we
are to trust that, then 12 hours and
4 days are the same thing. So where
was it said that within 12 hours the
material would still be published?
Nowhere. Was it explained in which
case the material will be submitted
and marked “’late”, or not submitted
at all? No.
So I was advised to appeal to the
Elections Committee. I did, but got
a reply about upholding the original
decision on the following grounds: “as
the other candidates are not running
in the same elections as you, it would
not be unfair to publish their manifes-
tos and not yours.” But hey, it wasn’t
me who mentioned them and made a
comparison in the first place, so that
has to be relevant. I was advised to
appeal to Union Court directly, but
for the last 2 days of the week the re-
turning officer was not in the office.
Meaning that the elections would be
over before I could do anything else.
Seeing how my complaint was being
passed around different committees,
being delayed, and how I was being
presented with various contradictory
arguments. I decided not to fight this
bureaucratic regime – after all, my
case was against the Union, so who
would I be getting support from? Not
signing a ‘no recourse to complain’
document would mean delaying the
election results by at least a week and
thus sabotaging other candidates’
campaigns...
I believe I was treated unfairly, so I
would encourage President-elect Alex
Kendall to pay greater attention to
such small details, and to also get rid
of this bureaucracy mentioned that is
present in the current Sabbatical Of-
fice. After all, that would mean a more
personal approach, which is kind of
what people want, isn’t it?
