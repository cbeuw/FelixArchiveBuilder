Brown defends hedge funds from EU
This Tuesday saw Gordon Brown fight
off European legislation, which would
have harmed the hedge fund and pri-
vate equity industry. The legislation,
which set out to force greater disclo-
sure and restrain pay in these sectors,
has been seen by the industry and gov-
ernment as being overly onerous.
Brown has managed to postpone the
vote on these measures until after the
general election, which many expect
to fall on May 6th. The Prime Minis-
ter’s personal intervention on the vote,
which was to be held at a finance min-
isters meeting, has pushed back the
date of the likely British defeat on the
matter, but has presumably done little
else.
Britain and it’s
involvement
An estimated 80% of
European hedge funds are
based in London, along with
60% of private equity firms.
Approximately $2,702bn
is managed in Europe by
alternative investment funds
at the end of 2008.

Lords vote to bring
down internet pirates
The House of Lords has
passed the Digital Econ-
omy Bill after a 2nd vote
which incorporated sever-
al changes. The legislation
originally contained the
ability to rapidly change
laws on online copyright
without further change of
legislation. Theformofthe
Bill which has now been
passedallowsforCourtsto
force ISPs to block certain
websites which are used for illegal file sharing. The proposals
remain controversial and meet opposition from BT, Google and
Facebook who all believe the Bill is unfair and users should be
fined rather than banned if they persistently share files.
Government Climate
Change Exageration
Nowadays Dennis
Skinner is quite simi-
lar to most MPs. The
man who once held
the position of chair
of the Labour Party
still maintains some of
the fire that earnt him
the name the ‘Beast of
Bolsworth’. In a House
of Commons debate
over the BA work-
ers strike Skinner felt
he had been interupted by the Speaker, John Bercow, and
asked why “you only stop me and not the others?”. Follow-
ing an attempt to bring back order from the Speaker, Skin-
ner again jumped in with “you do plenty of interrupting”.

The Advertising
Standards Authority
(ASA) has banned two
adverts made by the
government to raise
awareness of climate
change. The adverts in
question used a nurs-
ery rhyme format with
a doomsday-esque
message of climate
change. The ASA ruled
that the adverts went
beyond realms of current scientific concensus and as such
should no longer be used. Ed Milliband, the Climate Secre-
tarydefendedtheadvertssayingthathehadanobligationto
“to explain how people can make a difference themselves”.
Hedge funds make their money in
the somewhat shady area of alterna-
tive investments. By using a variety of
financial tools and wizardry, they seek
to create sizeable profits for their in-
vestors. Investors are typically wealthy
individuals who have to meet certain
criteria, and in exchange for meet-
ing these criteria the fund is exempt
from some regulations which ordinary
funds have to comply with.
It is unlikely that Brown would have
taken action if it was the banks in the
firing line. Public anger against the
large banks has somewhat died down
as the economy recovers, but the
memory remains. Less people know
what a hedge fund is, so Brown is able
to act to defend this incredibly profit-
able (and taxable) business without
harming his reputation with voters.
James Lees
James Lees Politics Editor France and Germany are leading the
coalition of EU nations seeking to push
through the change. The Spanish press
seems to have invented some kind of
conspiracy of ‘Anglo Saxon specu-
lators’ who are the cause of all the
world’s problems, or at least Spain’s.
This makes it more surprising that Mr
Zapatero of Spain, who currently holds
the rotating EU presidency, agreed to
postpone the vote. The reason is likely
to be the close ties Brown has built
with Europe.
The Conservatives are less ‘in’ with
Europe so would likely have not been
able to do this. The Conservative
spokesman for the City, Mark Hoban,
has said that Brown had to plead for
the deferral as he had failed to dilute
the directive at an earlier stage. The
Conservatives say that they would base
a Treasury minister in Brussels to keep
track of legislation.
The move of delaying the vote was
welcomed by people in the industry
such as Javier Echarri of the Venture
Capital Association who has been
quoted as saying “Further work is
needed on this draft law and minis-
ters have recognised that”. How much
longer British interests can be defend-
ed from Europe is a key issue for the
City, but whether it will be a key issue
for the electorate remains to be seen.
The general election is expected to
be held shortly after we come back
from the Easter break. If by some
freakish political manoeuvre the elec-
tion is held over Easter, I would im-
plore you to read the manifestos of the
parties and remember that who you
vote for genuinely does matter.
