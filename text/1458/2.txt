Imperial tightens security
after thefts last month
Imperial College is inviting local police
into college and stepping up weekend
security after a number of “opportun-
ist thefts”.
Imperial College has reported a rise
in “criminal activity” in the South
Kensington area, stating that during
February there have been twelve op-
portunist thefts on the South Kensing-
ton campus alone - all of which had no
evidence of forced entry.
The thefts have largely been in build-
ings which have immediate entrances
onto public roads, such as Mechanical
Engineering, Huxley, Blackett and the
RSM building.
In order to try and crack down on
thefts in the Huxley building, local
police will be setting up “crime preven-
tion desks” to give out advice and leaf-
lets informing people as to how they
can reduce the likelihood of becoming
a victim of crime.
In addition to this, Imperial College’s
security will be patrolling the area
more frequently whilst there is a lot of
people movement: at lunchtime and
from 4pm until 6pm when people are
typically leaving College.
Measures for other buildings are
currently being discussed and will be
announced over the next few days.
There will also be extra campus-wide
patrols at weekend and CCTV pictures
will be used to monitor people “tailgat-
ing” others into buildings.
The security team will be frequent-
ly checking offices to see if they have
been left unlocked, locking any that
they find and registering them in a da-
tabase along with an inventory of valu-
ables left unattended.
Westminster Council currently pro-
vide college with “SmartWater” to
mark all of its equipment, and two po-
lice officers have been assigned to as-
sisting the college’s security during this
time.
Students and staff are advised to
register personal equipment with the
police’s immobilise website, look out
for suspicious activity and avoid leav-
ing valuables lying around - especially
in areas such as college cafés and the
library.
Anybody who witnesses anything or
anyone suspicious should contact Col-
lege’s Emergency Security number on
4444 from any campus phone, or 0207
589 1000 from any other phone. If pos-
sible, try to remember the description
of any suspicious persons seen around
campus. Sourced from live.cgcu.net
An Imperial College international stu-
dent found guilty of fraud has been
imprisoned for six months and threat-
ened with deportation, throwing fresh
controversy on the College’s policy of
monitoring students.
Minzheng Du, a 28 year old Chinese
national in his second year of postgrad-
uate studies, attempted to take an Eng-
lish language entrance examination for
the University of Warwick on the behalf
of another person last December. He
was able to provide falsified identifica-
tion in order to achieve this; however,
he made the critical error of providing
exam invigilators with a passport photo
that looked entirely dissimilar to his
own face.
Du was one of a group of three in-
dividuals who were arrested and sen-
tenced in February in connection with
fraudulent behaviour concerning the
same examination. A statement from
the Imperial College Press Office con-
firms that, “an international PhD stu-
dent at Imperial has been convicted of
a fraud offence and given a custodial
sentence, following which he is due to
be deported from the UK. Since he will
no longer be present to complete his
course he has now ceased to be a stu-
dent of the College.”
Questions have been raised as to how
Du was allowed to operate illegally out-
side of Imperial despite the College’s
stringent policy on ensuring that the
attendance of international students
meets high government standards.
Newly introduced for the 2009-2010
academic year across all UK universi-
ties, the UK Border Agency’s (UKBA)
Points Based Immigration System stip-
ulates, by law, that the College report
when a student misses 10 ‘expected
interactions’
. These can range from ar-
ranged meetings with staff to work
deadlines.
This news is unlikely to benefit the
college’s standing with UKBA. Official
material from the College states that it
is now “a College regulation that stu-
dents are required to attend to the satis-
faction of the Head of Department”. The
College has taken it upon itself to make
sure that the scheme applies to non-
international students as well.
The Department of Computing, of
which Du was a student of, has been
unwilling to comment on Du’s attend-
ance in college before the incident in
December, casting further suspicion on
the suitability of the regulatory system.
UKBAs involvement in university
policy across the country has not been
without its share of criticism.
Ashley Brown, current Imperial Col-
lege Union President, voiced his disap-
proval of the introduction of the system
in a sabbatical blog post on the union
website last year, citing that “[it] looks
set to be an exemplar of incompetent
bureaucracy”

University chiefs’ salaries soar
The salaries of senior university staff
have come under scrutiny after it has
emerged that certain salaries have
doubled or even tripled over the last
decade, far overtaking the salary in-
crease of the average higher education
teaching professionals.
The positions that are seeing this
swell in pay are mostly the vice-chan-
cellors within universities, who are ef-
fectively the heads of the university, as
well as academic administrators, medi-
cal consultants and scientists.
It has been found that there are cur-
rently 80 vice-chancellors who earn
more than the Prime Minister, includ-
ing Imperial’s ex-Rector Sir Roy An-
derson, some of whom saw pay rises
of 15-20% last year alone, compared to
the average higher education teaching
professionals’ 45.7% pay rise over ten
years.
This dramatic rise in salary amongst
senior higher education staff has been
described as being hidden “behind the
clandestine world of remuneration
committees”. Such committees are set
up by each university to decide on the
salary of staff by making comparisons
with the salaries of other higher educa-
tion institutions.
The comparable average salary be-
tween all the institutions continually
increases due to competition between
them for the best staff, as well as there
being simply a greater number of uni-
versities. It is also said that these edu-
cational remuneration committees
make comparisons to private and com-
mercial organisations, which generally
operate very differently to educational
institutions, and therefore offer much
higher salaries.
Combined with the state funding
that educational institutions usu-
ally receive, top academics are seeing
their pay packets grow, amidst surveys
showing that two-thirds of vice-chan-
cellors believe tuition fees should be
increased to £5000.
The idea of higher tuition fees for
students will no doubt serve to bal-
ance out the cuts that all universities
will face, and it is feared that junior
lecturers will experience redundancies
as a consequence of the salary increase
amongst senior staff as well as the omi-
nous funding cuts.
The universities justify the soaring
salaries of senior academic staff by ar-
guing that competition amongst uni-
versities requires an appealing remu-
neration to attract the best academics
possible. Therefore, they argue that the
remuneration packages should also re-
flect these demands.
