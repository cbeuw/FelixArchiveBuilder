FRIDAY 19 MARCH 2010
Eric Hoffer: “Rudeness is the weak man’s imitation of strength.”
Quote of the Week
Wordoku 1,458
Solution 1457
How to play:
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku; we’ve just replaced
numbers with letters. Complete the puzzle and then
send the whole grid to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the word alone. It’s not
an anagram.
Evil Wordoku is exactly the same... only harder... and
there’s a letter missing... that MAY be a duplicate -
just solve it like normal and insert the letter that you
believe makes the word. And worth double.

V
arsity this week. Did you no-
tice? What with full sized li-
ons walking about the place,
countless e-mails and even
more posters, even the ‘worst ACC
Chair ever’ noticed something big was
going down. With the College side
having already beaten the Medics once
this year, combined with the move to a
new location, it was guaranteed to be
heated. But it’s not all about the Rug-
by- I personally love the songs. These
are not your typical loutish football
‘who are ya’ type, because first off that
doesn’t even make sense.
For those of you who don’t know, the
rugby match is called the JPR Williams
Cup, after the great Welsh and Lions
rugby player. And also for those of you
who don’t know, JPR has recently been
in the news for drink-driving. He tried
to fool the breathalyser machine by
sucking pennies, failed to do so, and
received a 17-month ban. JPR is also a
medic.
The chorus of ‘JPR give us a wave’
soon rang out, and a wave was some-
thing JPR was not going to give. How-
ever this was something College had
expected and had prepared a digitally
remastered version of the Monkees
1697 hit ‘Daydream Believer’. It went
like so:
‘Cheer up JPR,
Oh what can it mean?
To a coin-sucking Welshman,
And his shit medic team.
’
Fantastic stuff, in fact almost poetic
in nature, yet still the much-wanted
wave was not forthcoming. College
were not beaten, and JPR was soon to
be told to book his taxi home. College
gracefully reminded JPR that ‘You’re
not driving, you’re not driving, you’re
not driving anymore (anymore).
’ Which
was rather kind of us, as the very last
thing we would want is for the poor
man to have to got to court again. It
was at this point where some members
of the crowd realised that if JPR was
banned from driving then he would
no longer be needing the red Audi
cabriolet in which he was stopped the
previous week. Rather than have this
beautiful car sitting unused, one col-
lege member offered to purchase it;
the best way to set this up would be to
get 1000 people to chant ‘JPR where’s
your car?’ over and over again. Classic.
Wordpath 1,458
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORD -> WARD
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WARD -> DRAW
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4 letter
word from any 5+ letter word that contains them both.
e.g. DRAW -> WING (via DRAWING)
No consecutive steps may be made by the same method.
e.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS) would
be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path
between the two words. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Send your solutions to sudoku.felix@
imperial.ac.uk.

Well done to last
week’s winner Jacky
Wong. Again this
seems to be a puzzle
youallliketogetdone.
Fanbloodytastic.
We’ll keep making
them up.
Being a newspaper, we are very
interested in words down in the felix
office. Over the years we have been
collecting them together in a book
along with their meanings. We think
this would be a very popular tool for
people that want to know more about
words and want to understand us in
conversation. It’s not quite ready yet,
there are many words in the English
language (and even more if you count
other languages but we agreed to not
include these as it would make the
book too heavy), so it is taking some
time to put together but when it is
done we think it will make us lots of
monies.
In the course of their research, our
exceptionally capable researchers
came across a lot of other interesting
facts about words, such as where they
originate from (their ‘etymologies’)
and being exceptionally capable they
made notes. We’re not going to include
these in the book so we’re giving some
of these to you for free.
CAPABLE (adj.)
Unsurprisingly this word comes from
the joining together of ‘cape’ and ‘able’
(hence the pronunciation even though
it looks like ‘cap-able’). It is used to
refer to things people can only do, or
are better at, when wearing a cape. It
is widely accepted to originate from
superman, who was ‘cape able’ of
flying when wearing his cape but had
to walk to places when in normal
people clothes.
If you have a word whose origin you’re
interested in, send it to us at sudoku.
felix@imperial.ac.uk and we’ll put
our research team to work on it. Or
just look it up in the dictionary.
T
echnical term meaning:
‘word origin/ history’.
