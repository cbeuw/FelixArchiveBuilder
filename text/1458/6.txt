ho do mums
think they are?
Just because they
managed to get
knocked up doesn’t
entitle them to an opinion on any and
absolutely every subject – when funda-
mentally their only additional area of
expertise is not putting a condom on?
Why can’t they just be happy with
a box of Thorntons, a bunch of flow-
ers, a Sex and the City DVD box set or
my personal favourite, a fiver in a card
mocked up in MS paint once a year?
Yet whether it’s global climate mod-
els, pharmacology, the logistical and
statistical merits of using helicopters
in Afghanistan – and now whether
children are born fundamentally ‘Evil’.
It seems that a large portion of the
press can find no-one better to com-
ment than some self righteous mum
who is angry for whatever reason.
This same mum is also undoubtedly
flattered when her favourite tabloid
rag comes knocking for an exclusive
interview.
In forming policies for the next few
years, which experts have the main
parties been busily consulting with?
Well, that would be the eminent
thinkers at ‘Mumsnet’, no less.
On Wednesday Maggie Atkinson,
England’s children’s commissioner,
was forced to apologise for voicing
her opinion on Britain’s archaic laws
on the age of criminal responsibility.
This was because Jamie Bulger’s mum
(now Denise Fergus) found Atkinson’s
opinion, also shared by the entire con-
tinent of Europe, ‘hurtful’. After a to-
ken effort at being sensible, Ed Balls
didn’t so much cave in as implode.
Better to keep locking up ten-year-
olds without question, he reasoned
– God forbid we put any more of our
precious mums at risk of hurt feelings!
It goes without saying anyone would
genuinely sympathise with parents
who’ve lost their kids in these circum-
stances, and in the end I’m sure these
people are mostly well meaning in
their motives. But how can we expect
to have a rational discussion on any-
thing when the emotive comments of
mother of xyz gets thrown into Brit-
ain’s already potent blend of tabloid
puke and child worship. This is made
even worse now that experts face los-
ing their jobs if they publicly disagree
with whoever is mum of the moment.
Don’t get me wrong, we all love our
mums. However, we also know they
sometimes don’t know when to shut
up.

rossing the road the other
day, a thought struck me,
which is the safest thing to
be struck by when cross-
ing the road.
Why is KFC called KFC? It stands
for Kentucky Fried Chicken, or at least,
that’s what I thought. But if that’s true,
why shorten it? Easier to fit on a sign, yes,
but McDonald’s doesn’t have any trou-
ble, and as appellations go, it’s not much
longer. What exactly are they hiding?
Maybe they’re not called Kentucky
Fried Chicken anymore because that’s
not what they are anymore. But what
exactly are they not? Are they no
longer Kentucky? As far as I know, the
bluegrass state hasn’t suddenly slipped
(over Virginia) into the sea.
Perhaps, in an effort to promote a
healthier (not to mention environ-
mentally friendly and multi-cultural)
fast-food option, KFC decided not
to fry their chickens, but bake them,
or steam them instead. Kentucky
Steamed Chicken does sound quite
appetising. However, maybe they were
afraid that unknowing students might
confuse the KSC on Gloucester Road
with Košice International Airport,
pride of Slovakian aviation. I can un-
derstand their concern; it’s a surpris-
ingly easy mistake to make.
However, an experimental foray into
the establishment in question led me to
discount this hypothesis. Not only did
the chicken turn paper transparent,
but it did strange things to my insides
as well. I don’t want to say that I now
have a see-through small intestine per
se...but that meal has given me a whole
new perspective on the gastrointesti-
nal system, quite literally.
So what’s left? Kentucky Fried but
not Chicken? Surely not, that’s pat-
ently ridiculous. At least, that’s what I
thought. But the leg:breast ratio doesn’t
work out. KFC sells ten times as many
drumsticks as it does breast fillets. Us-
ing chickens, that amounts to a crimi-
nal waste of meat somewhere along
the line. And wasting meat is wasting
money, and no self-respecting com-
pany of any size would be happy with
that. So what did KFC do? They turned
to that great revolutionary, the force
that transforms eels into eagles, Evolu-
tion! (Cue thunder and lightning).
At its most mundane, evolution is
simply the accumulation of succes-
sive mutations over time. Occasion-
ally, a mutation arises that will cause a
chicken to grow a third leg. In the wild,
this would be selected against and the
mutation, not to mention the chicken,
would soon die out. However, if you
want a chicken with three legs, you’ve
just won the evolutionary lottery. If in-
stead you wanted a chicken with four
legs...well, you just have to wait for
your number to come up.
Normally if you wanted to play God
with domestic fowl, you’d have to wait
a few million years for the result, but
with a thousand battery hens dosed
up on penicillin and amphetamines,
strange things happen on a rather
short time-scale. The same holds true
for boarders in Public School. KFC
didn’t know what they wanted to cre-
ate and certainly didn’t know what they
ended up with but knew it would make
money, and that was good. And on the
sixth day, KFC uncreated the chicken
and they saw that it was good.
What they created can’t be accu-
rately described without breaking
language but let’s have a go. It’s...like a
ball, roughly, with breasts all over. In-
stead of feathers, it’s covered in goose-
pimples. Fat little legs shoot out at
random angles. Are there fifty? A hun-
dred? Who knows? It moves – it’s free-
range poultry – by constantly falling
over. With no visible beak or cloaca, it’s
hard to tell whether it’s upside-down
or downside-up, or even leftside-right.
It sweats BBQ sauce.
So KFC succeeded in creating a new
money-saving fast-food meat. But they
had a problem. What they created,
no matter how genius in inception,
was by no stretch of the imagination
a chicken. By no definition could it
so be called, not genetically and cer-
tainly not legally. They couldn’t sell it
as chicken, not unless they wanted it
with fries and a hefty lawsuit – which
went against the whole “make money”
business plan. And they couldn’t say it
wasn’t chicken. With people still get-
ting their genomes in a twist over stem
cells, they’d blow their telomeres over
the world’s first...whatever it was.
So KFC took the easiest route and
quietly dropped the Chicken from
their name. Goodness knows what
the C stands for now. With that over, I
wonder how long it’ll be before Texan
Chicken comes clean.
RhysDaviesisn’t sure about fried chicken...
“Not only did the
chicken turn paper
transparent, but it
did strange things
to my insides as
well.”
