felix FRIDAY 19 MARCH 2010
S
o I finally have a little time
to myself after an incredibly
manic week of performing
Hair (see the little review
next to this for details on
how it went). It was an amazing experi-
ence but what was even more amazing
was the response from the audience.
Even Mr Editor-in-Chief Dan Wan was
seen boogie-ing on stage with the rest
of the cast and much of the felix team.
See! Dancing makes everyone happy!
The end of term is nearly upon us
and we find ourselves faced with a
month of revision otherwise known as
Easter. So I thought I’d have a look at
what you can do artwise in the tiny ex-
cuse for a break your mum makes you
take when you’re revising.
My favourite option is to race down
to the piano and pound out a few
tunes. My Dad is convinced he has
to get the piano retuned everytime I
return to college. Not only can I keep
my mind active with my mad sight-
reading skills but I’m also pounding
out all my revision frustration. Nice.
If you’re not musically inclined why
not grab a pen and paper and have
a bit of a doodle. Take a look out of
your window and draw what you see
(in my case this is an ugly bungalow
and dog walkers, sigh). If you’re feel-
ing really frustrated why not go a bit
abstract and start hurling paint-filled
balloons. Then sell it to the Tate Mod-
ern and never have to work ever again.
If art isn’t your thing you could always
do some writing. My blog always fills
up when it’s exam time as I prefer to
think of anything but Chemistry.
This week we’ve gone a bit theatre-
centric. But we’ve stayed at Imperial to
do so – yay for Imperial Arts! There’s a
review of Hair; I was in that so I’m a bit
biased but Dan did just tell me it was
the best thing he’s ever seen at Impe-
rial. There’s also a preview of Noises
Off which is set to be just as awesome
as Hair but with less dancing.
I seem to know most of the cast so
I’ll definitely be going. I’ve also taken
a look at the history of front row seats
for all you theatre history fans and an-
yone who likes to see the action when
at a play.

A
Tribal-Love-Rock musi-
cal. It is perfectly fitting
then that ICU’s Musical
Theatre Society chose
Hair as their spring term
2010 production – a musical writ-
ten by young people, for young peo-
ple. Daring, absurd, surreal, lewd and
crude all at once, Hair is also both fun
and deeply political, tracking the lives
of a tribe of New York hippies as they
rebel against the government, ‘square’
parents and the draft.
With book and lyrics by Gerome
Ragni and James Rado and music by
Galt MacDermot, this colourful and
groovy show began life in 1967 off
Broadway. Fast-forward to over forty
years later and it has enjoyed lengthy
runs on both sides of the Atlantic as
well as countless recordings of the
soundtrack, a film adaptation and sev-
eral awards. And for good reason too.
MTSoc’s production did glorious
justice to the forty-odd songs that tie
together the story of the Age of Aquar-
ius tribe. Free love, free acid and free
flowing hair abound but the looming
threat and arrival of the draft throw
hippy Claude into moral indecision as
he deliberates over whether to resist
the draft or resist pacifism.
Kicking off with the brilliant “Aquar-
ius”, the cast conveyed the vibrance
and energy of that time with their
own never ending vibrance and energy
making one marvel at just how talent-
ed the cast are, not only wrestling with
science degrees but also delighting us
with impressive voices and acting skills
Let the sunshine in...
Caz Knight embraces her inner-hippy at MTSoc’s Hair
after many, many hours of hard work
and rehearsals.
The whole cast were fantastic,
managing to sing us numbers such as
“Sodomy” and “I Got Life” (now used
in Muller adverts) at the same time as
leaping around the stage, but within
them some truly incredible voices
were to be found – Ebitimi Alaibe
as tribe member Dionne and Robert
Felstead as main-man Claude with
Tosin Ajayi treating us to his wick-
ed dance moves and James Brown
impression.
The costumes and wigs were equal-
ly wonderful as were the set and
lighting. Musical director Zoe Hum-
phries must also be commended for
steering the brilliant band through
the two-hour show that ended in an
on-stage, audience-inclusive Be-In to
“Let The Sun Shine”.
If you have not got enough “Hair”,
the West End production begins at
the Gielgud theatre on April 1st.
More than anything this awesome
production should persuade every-
one to indulge in more of MTSoc and
Imperial College’s artistic offerings
and performances.
The vibrant cast of Hair. Missed it? Well wah-wah boo-hoo that was silly.
It’s a musical, of course there’s got to be man love
