Imperial unimpressive as the Medics take
JPR Williams Cup for 8th consecutive year.
Jovan Nedic reports on the action from
this years match at Old Deer Park
T
wo tries by Man of the
Match James Sharples at
a buzzing Old Deer Park
Stadium on Wednesday
night saw that the Imperi-
al Medicals retained the JPR Williams
Cup for the eighth consecutive year.
College had the upper hand go-
ing into the game, having beaten and
drawn against the Medicals earlier in
the season, something that definitely
added hope to the College support-
ers that packed the stands of the Lon-
don Welsh Stadium. However, Varsity
seems to be one of those games where
previous performance counts for noth-
ing on the night.
The first half was, by all accounts,
College’s half, playing some sublime
rugby and constantly threatening the
Medicals try line. In a stark contrast
to previous years, it was the College
forwards that were dominating the
scrums, with some excellent work by
O’Rourke as well as Louwagie and
Coggrave on their Varsity debut. The
sustained pressure from the College
forwards saw them ebb ever nearer to
the Medicals try line, eventually earn-
ing a penalty in a kickable position,
however, kicker Newton was unable to
convert leaving the score 0-0.
This sustained pressure carried on
for the rest of the half, yet College
never seemed able break the game line
and put the Medicals on the back foot.
Despite this pressure, the Medicals
were the first to score after a fortunate

bounce saw scrum half Manyard un-
leash Sharples on the wing who com-
fortably ran in the try to give the Medi-
cals a 5-0. Fly-Half Neville was unable
to score the conversion.
After the restart, the College side
were determined to get some points
on the board with the forwards in-
creasing the pressure on the Medicals,
eventually earning another penalty
in front of the posts on the 22m line.
An out of form Newton managed to
strike the upright with the kick, but
was able to recover the ball, giving the
possession back to College. After a few
more phases, College managed to set
up a rolling maul in the Medicals 22,
which they managed to push over the
line giving a well earned try to the Col-
lege forwards. Newton converted the
kick to give College a 7-5 lead. A pen-
alty a piece, before the end of the half
saw the score-line at 10-8 to College,
who were definitely looking the most
threatening.
The second half saw a renewed and
regenerated Medicals side take it to the
College backs. Despite the best efforts
of scrum half Freddie Chalke, who JPR
Williams gave a noteworthy mention
after the game, the College backs never
seemed able to threaten the Medicals,
something which they would regret
later in the game.
Poor kicking and decision making by
the College backs eventually led to the
Medicals first try of the second half,
with Neville again unleashing Sharp-
les on the wing after College’s fullback,
Joachim, was turned over in his 22. A
successful conversion by Neville gave
the Medicals a 15-10 lead early in the
second half. The Medical backs were
attacking the line with such a high
intensity that it was only a matter of
time before they would break the line
again, and it was the Medicals centre
who all but put the game to rest after
he crossed the line to give them a 22-
10 lead.
Despite the upper hand that the
Medicals had, the College side were
determined to get another try and had
an extensive period of pressure in the
Medicals half, which saw penalty after
penalty being given against the Medi-
cals. With 10 minutes to go, contro-
versy struck after two Medical players
were sin-binned, one for repeatedly
killing the ball and the second to Ben
Davies for a dangerous tackle on the
