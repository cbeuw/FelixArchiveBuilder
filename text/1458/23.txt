50 years of Les Cahiers Du Cinéma
Pierrot le Fou
France/Italy | 1965 | col | 110 mins | dir. Jean-Luc
Godard, with Jean-Paul Belmondo, Anna Karina
Fed up with his wife and Paris, Jean-Paul Belmondo
heads for the south of France with old flame Anna
Karina, a gangster’s moll. Based on Lionel White’s
novel Obsession, but mostly improvised as Godard
was inspired by locations en route to the South, this
is one of the director’s very best films – a bewilder-
ing blend of genres and visual styles, shot in sun-
splashed colour by Raoul Coutard, with a cameo
by tough-guy director Sam Fuller and an explosive
finale. ‘Pierrot le fou isn’t really a film,’ said Godard
on its release, ‘it’s an attempt at cinema.’

La Femme d’à côté (The Woman Next Door)
France | 1981 | col | 106 mins | dir. François Truf-
faut, with Gérard Depardieu, Fanny Ardant
Truffaut’s penultimate film pursues several themes
that the director favored throughout his career,
namely adultery, obsession, amour fou and the
ever-thrilling crime passionnel. Bernard (Gérard
Depardieu) and Mathilde (Fanny Ardant) are two
former lovers, thrown back together by destiny
when Mathilde and her new husband move in next
door. Love stories must have a beginning, a middle
and an end, agree Bernard and Mathilde, who seem
perpetually stuck between the second and third of
these stages.
fri 26 mar | 8.40pm
Event
An evening to mark the publication of A Short His-
tory of Cahiers du Cinéma by Emilie Bickerton, the
first full history in English of the legendary maga-
zine. Emilie Bickerton will give an introduction be-
fore the screening and a Q&A afterwards.
sat 27 mar | 6.15pm
Irma Vep
France | 1996 | col | 97 mins | dir. Olivier Assayas,
with Maggie Cheung, Jean-Pierre Léaud
This witty satire on film-making features Léaud as a
washed-up auteur determined to remake Feuillade’s
silent classic Les Vampires in his own personal style.
Hong-Kong superstar Cheung plays the film-within-
the-film’s heroine, Irma Vep (an anagram for vam-
pire), a burglar who spends most of the film dressed
in a tight, black, latex rubber catsuit, defending her
director’s odd choices to hostile crew members and
journalists.
sun 28 mar | 2.00pm
Le Beau Serge
France | 1959 | b&w | 98 mins | dir. Claude Chab-
rol, with Gérard Blain, Jean-Claude Brialy
Chabrol’s debut feature is a powerful examination
of male friendship and its consequences with Jean-
Claude Brialy as a student who returns from Paris to
his childhood home to find that his once-brilliant
friend (Blain) has become an alcoholic after the loss
of a child. A bleak and beautifully observed picture
of provincial life, Le Beau Serge is generally regard-
ed as the film that launched the New Wave.
mon 29 mar | 6.15pm
Le Genou de Claire (Claire’s Knee)
France | 1970 | col | 105 mins | dir. Eric Rhomer,
with Jean-Claude Brialy, Aurora Cornu, Béatrice
Romand, Laurence de Monaghan
One of Rhomer’s most celebrated films casts Brialy
as Jérôme, holidaying on Lake Annecy, who begins a
light-hearted flirtation with his landlady’s daughter,
only to fall for her half-sister and develop an irre-
pressible desire to caress her knee.
tue 30 mar | 6.15pm
Les Glaneurs et la glaneuse (The Gleaners & I)
France | 2000 | col | 82 mins | doc | dir. Agnès
Varda | cert. U
Why do food producers throw so much away when
people go hungry? Agnès Varda, gleaner of im-
ages, follows other gleaners, people who collect
what other people throw away, food and junk. This
thought-provoking social and poetic documentary
has been praised at many festivals and was voted
the best documentary of 2001 by the National So-
ciety of Film Critics.

ahiers du cinéma (Notebooks on
Cinema) is an influential French
film magazine founded in 1951 by
André Bazin, Jacques Doniol-Val-
croze, and Joseph-Marie Lo Duca.
It developed from the earlier magazine Revue du
Cinéma (Review of the Cinema) involving members
of two Paris film clubs — Objectif 49 (Objective 49)
(Robert Bresson, Jean Cocteau and Alexandre Astruc,
among others) and Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin (Cin-
ema Club of the Latin Quarter). Initially edited by Éric
Rohmer (Maurice Scherer), it included amongst its
writers Jacques Rivette, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chab-
rol, and François Truffaut.
Cahiers re-invented the basic tenets of film criticism
and theory. A 1954 article by Truffaut attacked La qual-
ité française (the “Tradition of French Quality”) and was
the manifesto for the auteur theory — resulting in the re-
evaluation of Hollywood films and directors such as Alfred
Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Robert Aldrich, Nicholas Ray,
Fritz Lang, and Anthony Mann.
Cahiers du Cinema authors also championed the work of di-
rectors Jean Renoir, Roberto Rossellini, Kenji Mizoguchi, Max
Ophüls, and Jean Cocteau, by centering their critical evalua-
tions on a film’s mise en scène.
The magazine also was essential to the creation of the Nouvelle
Vague (New Wave) of French cinema, which centered on films
directed by Cahiers authors such as Godard and Truffaut. The
Nouvelle Vague was one of the most influential film movements
ever; it saw film as an art form instead of simple entertainment.
The whole medium of film was readdressed by considering screen
language, natural scripts and improvisation.
The Auteur Theory saw the director take sole responsibility for the
quality of his film in the same way as an author of a book. Although
Nouvelle Vague fizzled out at the end of the 60’s its spirit was taken up
by the ‘Brat Pack’ directors of the New Hollywood movement during
the 70’s. If it wasn’t for Les Cahiers du Cinema, the film world would
be a lot worse for wear.
As part of the 100 Years of Cinema programme, organised especially
to coincide with the centenary of the Institut français, 50 Years of Ca-
hiers du Cinéma will celebrate this legendary publication. Each decade
will be represented through a landmark film. This season also marks the
publication of A Short History of Cahiers du Cinéma by Emilie Bickerton,
who will discuss her book and introduce the screening of Pierrot le Fou on
23 March.
