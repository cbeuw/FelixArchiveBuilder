Where’s my
Happyderm?
Kawai Wong
Kawai Wong Fashion Editor
I am worth it.
One tiny little glitch however, is that
Happyderm is not on sale on English
soil. Every time I cross the English
Channel, the empty suitcase on the
outbound journey returns with a bil-
lion bottles of Happyderm.
Weeks ago I was on the continent. I
searched and searched and there was
no more. It has quite literally vanished
off all shelves. Pharmacies, department
stores, cosmetic boutiques... None of
them stock it anymore.
Has L’Oreal pulled my Happyderm
off the shelves to make way for ex-
pensive, and less effective skincare
lines?
I can see the red blotches and
pimples lurking in the corner, glee-
fully await the disappearance of the
last drop of Happyderm...
If you’re from Europe, can you let
me know if they still do Happyderm
in your country? Email me at fash-
ion.felix@imperial.ac.uk.

Spring Make Up Trends
So last week we looked at primers:
what you do with them and what they
are for. Now it’s time to look at the full
coverage provided by foundation.
When you’re shopping for founda-
tion, the best thing to do is to go to
your favourite department store and
get them to apply the one you want for
you. Then you can wear it for the rest
of the day and decide how well it stays
on, whether the colour tone is right
for you, and how it feels on your skin
(does it make you skin feel greasy/too
dry/break out?).
However, they’re not necessarily
right. You need to make the decision
to buy it yourself, everybody has their
own sense of style, so a woman who
works on the make-up counter might
be a fake-tan fiend and give you a far
more ‘bronzed’ look than what you
want, or what you would normally go
for.
Also, this may sound obvious but,
don’t put your regular foundation on
before you try to buy a new one; go
shopping with minimal make-up on,
so that you can really tell the differ-
ence between no make-up and the po-
tential new foundation.
Another good tip for when people
are doing your make-up for you, is to
get them to do half your face at a time,
as in do the left side then the right, so
that you can look in the mirror half
way through and see the effects of the
foundation.
Although this can be fairly time
consuming, and after you’ve had your
make-up applied you feel compelled
to buy the product, don’t! You don’t
need to buy the first foundation you
try. If you’re rushed for time and you
Spring is here! Now is the perfect time
to unearth the latest makeup trends!
The catwalks had many of their mod-
els parading down with a fresh pretty
look. Hair was worn soft and wavy to
complete the young milkmaid vibe.
Beautiful skin is essential to achieve this
look. It needs to be dewy and natural,
and a tinted moisturiser is the perfect
way to achieve this barely covered look.
Lips for day should be pink; any vari-
ation of the shade will work from a soft
rose to a pinky coral. For a bargain buy,
go for Rimmel as they always follow the
latest trend.
For the evening, lips should make a
statement. Deep glossy plums are bang
want to try a couple of foundations,
try it out on the inside of your wrist,
and see if you can cover up the veins.
This of course, won’t give you much
of an indication of how it will feel on
your skin, but you can at least get the
colour right. The inside of your wrist
matches your facial skin tone much
better than the back of your hand, so
don’t be tempted to try it out on the
back of your hand.
How do you decide which one is
right for you? You can choose from
liquid foundations, mousses, com-
pacts or tinted moisturisers, so which
is better?
To start with, you need to think about
your own skin type; normal skin types
can use pretty much anything, but if
you have dry skin, you need to look at
moisturising foundations, which usu-
ally come in liquid form. Also, dry skin
types should avoid powders and pow-
der finishes as these can make your
skin look flakey and even drier. On
the other hand if you have greasy skin,
and are prone to breakouts, you should
avoid oil-based liquid foundations.
OK, so now you’ve chosen the cor-
rect foundation, how do you apply it?
Make sure that your skin is clean and
your moisturiser has had a chance to
soak in properly before you apply your
foundation, otherwise it’ll slide off
fairly quickly. Spot little blobs of foun-
dation on each cheek, your forehead
and your chin, and then smooth these
blobs together using either a make-up
sponge or foundation brush. When
you smooth them together, make sure
you use downwards strokes with the
brush or the sponge. We do have tiny
hairs on our faces, and you need to
brush in the direction of the hairs, ie.
downwards, to keep them pushed flat
against your skin.
on trend here.
Eyes should have a sheer wash of vi-
brant colour across the lids; invest in a
good brush to ensure that the colour is
applied evenly and that the beautiful
sheer look is applied to perfection. Pastel
eyes were seen all over the catwalks from
Nicole Farhi to Dior.
Nails can be in a multiple array of
shades, from fun light pastels to strong
block brights. OPI’s Hong Kong collec-
tion will give you all of your nail needs.
These affordable nail varnishes are avali-
able from Selfridges.
Spring is an exciting time to experi-
ment with makeup. As the weather im-
proves, we can afford to be more daring.
Keep the look fresh and fun and there can
be no wrong.
The make-up at Erdem, done by An-
drew Gallimore, was minimalistic and
suited the show’s multicolour frocks
perfectly.
Tips to take home - fresh look for the
day, invest in a good foundation and add
colour to your cheeks with a tinted mois-
turisier. Bright lips - scarlet, fuschia, pink
to take you into the night.

I
used to have very troubled
skin. Greasy, easily irritated
and above all, those damning
pimples. Just as I thought all
hopes had gone, and that the
bad skin was here to stay, god sent me
this moisturiser from heaven. It is ex-
tremely light, non greasy and beauti-
fully scented. It is called Happyderm,
and it is from L’Oreal.
The little pink liquid keeps my skin
happy. All the irritation becomes a
thing of the past. I know cosmetics
ads often boast how their moisturisers
keep you ‘hydrated all day’. You
and I both know it is just a cheesy
line of gimmick. With Happy-
derm my skin is moisturised 24
hours a day. I glow! My skin glows
for the first time since puberty!
This bottle of joy was only £7
when I first discovered it. And
though the price has increased
over the year to £10, it is still af-
fordable. £10 for flawless skin.
