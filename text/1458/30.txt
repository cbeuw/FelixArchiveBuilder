Trololololololololololololololololololololololo-scopes
Let a creepy Russian man from the 60s lull you into a sense infantile arousal. Term over, finally WAN-k time.
Cancer
Alas, the world is so
cruel. You have no
friends, no life, no
free time. Work is
mounting up, stress is
building. It becomes
too much for you. You go to your basement
and put on a gas mask with the other end of
the tube in your anus whilst simulatanously
hanging yourself. Maybe you’ll at least get some
recognition from others when you’re gone.
Virgo
You go sky-diving
with the WI. You
all jump out of
the plane and are
holding hands in
a circle as you fall.
One by one all the elderly women have heart
attacks and you are holding hands with a
bunch of dead people. They fall to the ground
and when your parachute doesn’t deploy you
are cushioned by their soft, dead bodies.
Gemini
You play on Robot
Unicorn Attack
solidly for three
days. No sleep, no
food. You begin
hallucinating that
you are in fact a robot unicorn. You snap out
of the trip, but then when having sex with
your girlfriend you have a flashback and stab
her in the bajingo with your unicorn horn.
She bleeds to death on the sofa.
Pisces
It’s your birthday!
You have all of
your 2 friends
over to celebrate.
Everything’s great
until midnight when
christen your birthday with the contents of
your stomach. You wake to find a million traffic
signs in your room and trip on one, skewering
yourself in the process; cats violently rape your
body and you die. Cat Aids? Fun, no?
Leo
YAY EASTER! Good
excuse to eat chocolate,
no? You eat and eat
and eat and eat. You go
into a chocolate frenzy
and black out for a
few days. When you finally come back to your
senses you find yourself in a prison. “Why am I in
prison?” You discover several days later that you
are in prison because, during your frenzy, you
went to the zoo and ate a baby panda.
Aries
‘Possibly Oriental Or
Namibian’ and ‘The
Angry Naked Giraffe’
are writing this horo-
scope mwahwahaha!
Don’t hate us, we’ve
been doing computational coursework all week
and we need some kind of release. We could go
and splaff off in the privacy of our own homes but
it’s more fun to spray our bile here. ALRIGHT! SO
FUCK OFF! P.O.O.N. T.A.N.G signing out. Peace!
Scorpio
“Nice Scorpio girl
looking for handsome,
muscular man. Prefer-
ably should be well read
and have a desire to
be eaten.” Soon after
putting out this ad you find a man with a burning
desire to marinade his penis in mustard dress-
ing. Fantastic! You meet up and can’t wait to get
started. Sadly this man is not who he says he is. He
is an undercover officer. Jail for life. Bad times.
Libra
This week you have
your first sexual
experience with a girl
from ChemSoc. It’s the
first time that anyone
has ever touched your
penis but unfortunately you ruined the moment by
coming as soon as her soft hands touched it. Oh
and also you started farting. It was like a machine
gun, bullets out the front, gassey recoil out the
back. LAAAAAME. P.O.O.N. T.A.N.G AWAY!
Taurus
You start bleeding
from your anus. You
are initially con-
cerned but decide
you won’t do any-
thing unless it seems
too serious. During rugby your “male friend”
points at you, proclaiming you’re having a pe-
riod. You realise that the blood is trickling down
your legs and has soaked your shorts. You go to
bed and drown in your own blood overnight.
Capricorn
When you first came
to Imperial you were
a happy, handsome
boy with a headful
of sense. That’s how
it was for your first
term. Then you discovered these horoscopes
and a sudden sequence of tragic events befell
you and you lost your penis numerous times. We
transformed you into... well a girl basically. Can
you blame us? Movie?... Dinner?... Sex?!!... Pint?
Aquarius
You catch your
boyfriend watching
pterodactyl porn.
Realising you’re
unlikely to find
anyone better at
Imperial you decide to stick with him. You dress
up as a pterodactyl and squawk at him the next
night. He shuts the door on you and tells you to
get out of his house. The photo of you dressed
as a slutty pterodactyl is all over felix.

Sagittarius
When you first came
to Imperial you were
a happy, lovely girl
with your head in the
clouds. That’s how
it was for your first
term. Then you met us, we ground you down
by deriding you and taunting you. You stopped
being happy and friendly. We transformed you
into a bitter, angry little munchkin who jumps at
any occasion to be angry and sarcastic. Job done.
