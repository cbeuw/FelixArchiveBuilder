In
brief
‘A night of angry nerds’
On Sunday 14th March, the
Palace Theatre in London’s
West End was host to an
event described by Robin
Ince as “a night of angry
nerds.” Some of the finest
names in comedy, Ed Byrne
and Dara O’Briain amongst
them, joined forces with
scientists and science jour-
nalists such as Brian Cox (pictured - he’s a physicist!!!) and
Ben Goldacre to push the need for libel reform further into
the spotlight. The event took place to mark the end of ‘Li-
bel Week’. Highlights included a poem by comedian Tim
Minchin about scientific ignorance, a live interview with
Dr Peter Wilmhurst - currently being sued by NMT Medi-
cal - and a ‘sing-a-long-a-Simon-Singh-song’ performed by
Ariane Sherine, the woman behind the ‘Atheist Buses.’ Pro-
ceeds from the tickets went to the Libel Reform Campaign.
The approaching dawn
Preparations for the
launch of Akatsuki,
a Japanese satellite
bound for Venus, are
underway after the
relocation of the or-
biter to the island of
Tanegashima situated
to the south-west of
the country. Akatsuki, meaning ‘dawn’, will be launched
from the Tanegashima Space Centre later this spring.
It is hoped that the project will help explain why Venus, a
planet not dissimilar from our own, turned out to be so in-
hospitable. One of the features to be explored is the super-
rotation of Venus’ atmosphere which orbits the planet at a
staggering 400km per hour. It is also hoped that Akatsuki
will be the first satellite to capture images of lightning on
the planet thanks to a camera, specially-designed for the
purpose, being mounted on the orbiter.
Absolutely flawless
The ability for hu-
mans to regrow body
parts may no longer
be confined to the
realms of Hollywood.
The regrowth ability is
believed to have been
lost through evolution
but may be reactivated
by removal of the p21
gene.
Experiments conducted at the Wistar Institute, Philadel-
phia, have already seen regrowth of ear tissue in mice in
such a way as would leave no trace of the initial wound. The
removal of p21 causes adult cells to behave as stem cells,
meaning a temporary disabling of the gene would allow for
flawless healing and regrowth. However, as p21 is one of the
body’s defences against cancer, the side-effects of switch-
ing off this gene will need to be investigated further.
Researchers at the University of Cali-
fornia, Davis, have found the Holy
Grail; they have discovered that beer
is good for you. The drink is rich in
nutrients that can help prevent weak
bones. With almost 7 billion pints of
beer drunk in the UK each year, it is a
rich source of dietary silicon for much
of the population. The researchers
have concluded that silicon can help
cut the chance of developing diseases
such as osteoporosis.
The big question is, which types of
beer are better? Luckily for real ale
lovers, those beers containing malted
barley and hops have a higher silicon
content than those made from wheat.
Light lagers made from grains like
corn or rice have the lowest levels.
The research, published in the Jour-
nal of the Science of Food and Agri-
culture, examined 100 commercial
beers and their production methods.
The report says that roughly half of
the silicon in beer is readily ab-
sorbed by the body, making
it an excellent dietary
source of the min-
eral. Charles Bam-
forth, lead author of
the study, said: "Beers
containing high lev-
els of malted barley and
hops are richest in silicon.
Wheat contains less sili-
con than barley because it
is the husk of the barley that
is rich in this element. While
most of the silicon remains in
the husk during brewing, signif-
icant quantities of silicon none-
theless are extracted into wort and
much of this survives into beer."
Dr Claire Bowring, from the Na-
tional Osteoporosis Society, said:
"These findings mirror results from
previous studies which concluded
that moderate alcohol consumption
could be beneficial to bones. However,
while the National Osteoporosis So-
ciety welcomes measures to improve
bone health we do not recommend that
anyone increases their alcohol con-
sumption on the basis of these studies.
While low quantities of alcohol may
appear to have bone density benefits,
higher intakes have been show to de-
crease bone strength, with an alcohol
intake of more than two units per day
actually increasing the risk of break-
ing a bone. There are also many other
health concerns linked with alcohol
which cannot be ignored."
Catherine Collins, a dietician at St
George's Healthcare NHS Trust in
London, said that there is no recom-
mended daily intake of silicon as it is
hard to prove silicon deficiency due
to so little being needed. "Sources of
silicon do include beer – either alco-
hol-containing or alcohol-free – and
it's also added as an anti-caking agent
to powders such as baking powder. It
is found in different
amounts in wa-
ter, so contrib-
utes to beer's
total silica con-
tent. Silica may
well contribute
to bone health
but in a mi-
nor way. It is
not really sig-
nificant com-
pared with
nutrients that
we know are
essential for
bone health
and are po-
tentially
deficient in
the UK diet
– such as
calcium and
vitamin D."

What we’ve been
waiting for...
Big Barry Obama, everyone’s best
friend, recently unveiled that he will be
trimming the NASA budget, currently
standing at $18bn, and allowing only
a tiny increase in its pocket money - a
mere $1 bn in comparison to the usual
$3bn needed to continue on its current
path. This will have disastrous conse-
quences for George W’s dream of re-
turning to the Sea of Tranquillity by
2020, as well as for the $81bn Constel-
lation Program which was designed to
replace the ageing Space Shuttle Pro-
gram, due to stop operations by the
end of this year. $9bn has already been
spent on the program, and NASA still
has billions of dollars worth of con-
tractors to pay off.
The President now wants to nurture
commercial companies to take up the
mantle of space travel and develop
rockets able transport astronauts and
supplies to the International Space Sta-
tion, by setting aside $6bn to help start
up specialist space travel companies
to do the day-to-day remedial tasks
of space travel. However, this move by
Obama could leave the USA without a
manned space flight program, leaving
the hardcore American patriots feel-
ing naked and deserted in a contest
that the USA has dominated in recent
years. But do we really need manned
space flight? Is it beneficial to science?
When J.F. Kennedy set out his vision
for the future, he stated we should go
to the moon “not because it is easy, but
because it is hard”
. A great line, but in
conjunction with the American Dream,
one that has become very distorted, be-
cause in the 60’s it was all about beating
Club Stalin, and in this modern era of
scientific cooperation this mantra is not
needed.
The exploration of space is mainly
done by robots in unmanned missions
which can fly far off into space, crash
into comets and do things which, in
general, Icarus could not. In terms of
sheer ability to gather information, a
robot in space will be able to go further
into the abyss and be far more useful
to us than a human being would. Also,
factor in the fact that food, living quar-
ters, toilets, etc. would also have to be
transported with a human.
The only real human presence in
space is the International Space Sta-
tion. That will be finished (eventually)
later this year when all the infrastruc-
ture and technology needed to sustain
the ISS (resupply missions, astronaut
swaps, etc.) will already be in place.
Humans can do more than a ma-
chine can: we have intuition, explora-
tion would be faster and we can ana-
lyse a rock by picking it up, looking at
it, licking it and so on, but $81bn for a
human spaceflight (just to the moon)
is a massive amount of money! That’s
equivalent to nine LHCs ... nine!!!
Obama’s “vision” is not the end of
NASA and it won’t be the end of the
phrase “developed by NASA” or “made
for the NASA space program” which
has been exhausted by salesmen eve-
rywhere. NASA will still function as
a major developer of new technolo-
gies, but this moving of the goal posts
by the President could yield a com-
pletely different outlook on space. In
a comparison with the exploration of
the 16th century, when the explorers
turned from government-backed ones,
like Columbus et al., to ones of more
commercial nature, like the East India
Company.
In Obama’s words, he called for a
“game change”; this will force NASA
to come up with something com-
pletely different and move the space
program away from an impractical
and unhealthy nationalistic exhibition
of power. This will leave NASA able to
update technology that hasn’t changed
since the 60’s, change the dynamics of
space exploration and explore many
more avenues of discovery.
One giant leap for NASA
