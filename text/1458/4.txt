T
he last few days of this
year’s Sabbatical Elections
were manic as ever as re-
sults were announced this
past Monday evening in
da Vinci’s bar. The intense two week
election period saw Alex Kendall win
the position of Union President whilst
Heather Jones fought off her four com-
petitors to become next year’s Deputy
President (Clubs & Societies). Victoria
Masding and Ravi Pall won their duels
for their positions for next year’s Dep-
uty President (Welfare) and Deputy
President (Finance & Services) respec-
tively, whilst Meera Ganeshadevan
managed to stave off the threat of RON
(Re-open Nominations) to become
Deputy President (Education). There
was no shock result for Felix Editor as
Kadhim Shubber acquired the vast ma-
jority of votes cast.
After voting closed on Saturday
night, the final candidates’ meeting
saw the impending threat of delays to
the final announcements as Presiden-
tial candidates initially refused to sign
off statements demonstrating their
satisfaction with the election process.
Although the pressure of campaign-
ing was alleviated, the suspense of
awaiting results caused tension that
surfaced during the day on Monday. It
was understood that the new Deputy
Presidents, Felix Editor and Student
Trustees would be announced that
evening without the results of the
Presidential election.
Three out of four of the Presidential
candidates looked to lodge complaints
with Returning Officers Daniel Hill
and John James, who were responsi-
ble for administering 2010’s elections.
The rules state that results cannot be
announced until all official complaints
are resolved. By this stage in proceed-
ings, the new President of the Union
was said to be announced at earliest on
Friday 19th March.
After the Presidential candidates
were called to a separate meeting, all
three candidates eventually withdrew
their complaints and by approximately
4pm, results for the full set of sabbati-
cals were due to go ahead together that
evening.
The initial threat of at least a three
day delay to Presidential election re-
sults came to light as Stanislav Tarasov
believed he had been “treated unfairly”
by the Elections committee after for-
getting to submit his manifesto and
photo to the Union to put up on voting
website. After noticing several days af-
ter the given deadline for submissions,

the Returning Officers denied requests
for a late upload of the manifesto and
picture. Subsequently, Tarasov looked
to take the matter to Union Court,
Imperial College’s Union highest com-
mittee that also has responsibility for
overseeing the annual elections with
fairness and integrity. In an event of a
formal complaint straight to the Union
Court, the Court would have met on
the Thursday evening meaning results
could not have been announced until
at least Friday morning.
Tarasov himself is adamant he wish-
es to be heard even though he dropped
his final complaint.
“While I have no one to blame other
than myself, after my request to place
it online was denied on Tuesday, it
was pointed out to me that, unlike
other candidates who submitted it
within 12h after the deadline and were
marked late, mine was 4 days late. I
personally don’t recall the 12 hour time
interval being specified anywhere, in
constitution at least. So, in the context
of things, 12 hours and 4 days are the
same thing.”
The Union had received another
complaint from a Presidential candi-
date about the perceived illegal print-
ing of flyers by a Presidential rival.
It was claimed he had produced too
many A6 flyers that could be account-
ed for under the official election budg-
ets set for each candidate.
Fellow potential Presidential Alex
Kendall’s grievance was less signifi-
cant in comparison after he was fined
£20 for breaking the election’s pedan-
tic rulings. His campaign poster was
found by Returning Officer John James
in clear sight of a voting terminal (i.e. a
computer).
Tarasov and Kendall’s complaints
were quickly withdrawn on Monday,
but the third complaint took some de-
liberation from the candidate whether
or not to follow suit and withdraw it.
Eventually it was through, and so ten
minutes before da Vinci’s bar enter-
tained a full crowd to Imperial’s match
Ravi Pall
Deputy President
(Finance & Services) 2010/11
Who would your dream Summer
Ball headliner be?
Erol Alkan, he is undisputably the
god of electro. He’s sure to appeal
to a lot of outgoing students but to
cover all grounds, possibly MGMT or
something.
Heather Jones
Deputy President
(Clubs & Societies) 2010/11
What super-society would you
make out of existing societies?
I would never actually do this, but
combining the food societies to
Feast Soc would be pretty amazing.
Fulfilling Imperial’s feasting needs
sounds epic!
Vicki Masding
Deputy President
(Welfare) 2010/11
How do you feel about sharing an
office with Meera?
It’ll be great. She’s so small I’ll have
most of the space anyway. She’ll be
my paperweight for all the documents
that’ll be piling up on my desk.
Meera Ganeshadevan
Deputy President
(Education) 2010/11
Ifyouhadn’tbeenelected,what
wouldyoubedoing?
If I hadn’t been elected I would
probably have tried to get a job for a
few months and then gone travelling
to South America.... those plans are
now currently on hold.
Kadhim Shubber
Felix Editor 2010/11
Ifyoucouldfeatureanyone,literally
anyone,asacentrefoldnextyear,
whowoulditbe?
Dan Wan, but he’d have to be
completely nude, balls and
everything , right outside the Queen’s
Tower.
“I’m glad I now get
the chance to show
I meant what I said
in campaigning.”
Alex Kendall, President-elect
