Report
THE JARRATT Committee,
has published its report on
efficiency Studies in Universities.
The Committee, set up by the
Committee of Vice-Chancellors
and Principals, has come up with
detailed recommendations for
the Universities. In particular,
governing bodies should assert
themselves in respect of strategic
plans on academic decisions,
universities should develop a
rolling academic and institut-
ional plan, and performance
indicators for academic
performance should be
developed.
The report criticises
universities in that little formal
attempt is made to appraise
academic staff on a regular basis.
Currently academic staff are only
'reviewed' intermittently, often
with no formal feedback.
It is also recommended that
time is saved by having fewer
committee meetings involving
fewer people in the University.
The report is also strong in its
advice to Government, especially
regarding funding. It is nearly
impossible, says the report, for
universities to undertake realistic
long term planning when the
Government don't provide
broad policy guidelines on higher
education.
The Committee reported after
detailed studies in six
universities; Edinburgh, Essex,
Loughborough, Nottingham,
Sheffield and University College
London.

COLLEGE SECURITY Chief
'Hercule' Reeves has been kept
busy over the Easter vacation.
It seems that a practical joker
forged a 'College Notice' from
John Smith, announcing that a
new rector had been appointed.
The notice was circulated to
Heads of Department, Admin,
etc, etc. Imaginge Professor
Swanson's surprise when he
found that he had been make
Rector!
Reeves leapt into action,
though, when he noticed that
there was a distinctive flaw on the
typewriter used for the notice. He
was immediately dispatched on a
tour of all College typewriters, to
try to identify the guilty party!
The College notice went on to
announce the departure of
Estates Secretary Don Clark
IPM, to be replaced by a Mr F R
E Mason W M . Extensive
research on level O of the
Sherfield Building reveals that
the initials IPM and W M have
Royal Arch Freemasonic
connections.
Accommodation available

retainer required for
Summer. Flats for 3,4,5, 6,
