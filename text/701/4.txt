fake a Walk Dowq
Another museum bites the dust as this week FELIX takes a walk down
Exhibition Road to investigate the Victoria and Albert Museum. In
particular we look at the Boilerhouse Project, a good idea which seems to
have become temporarily submerged in sociology. All you budding
industrial designers out there don't miss this one.
EXHIBITION
ROAD SW7
CITY OF WESTMINSTER
NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS IN
DESIGN
The Victoria and Albert Museum
exudes conventionality from
every pore. Looking at it, with the
high roof, marble steps and a little
sign telling you where the gift
shop is is enough to turn the
stomach of many. If you go
inside, and pass the gift shop, a
short wander will take you to
Primary Victorian Gallery
Number One, which appears to be
full of bits of stone and pieces of
cloth. So does Primary Victorian
Gallery Number Two, and a few
minutes is enough to convince
you that the V&A is a place for
storing bits of stone and pieces of
cloth, which in fact it is. Ignore
the fact that most of the stuff here
has been chiselled off the walls of
capital cities on the other side of
the world against the occupant's
wishes. Here we are, right in the
middle of Britain's Cultural
Heritage, and it all seems so, well,
historical. Is there nothing in this
great temple of fine art to interest
the sort of hip student we all like
to think we are?
Well, the answer is 'Yes'. There
is the Boilerhouse Project, which
is aiming to show how industrial
design can be examined and
studied in a similar way to the rest
of the objects in the V&A.
It is linked with Habitat, the
High Street temple of smooth
design which has young trendies
all over the UK filling their flats
with pine and plastic. As you
would expect the Boilerhouse
itself is a rather small hot room,
and it is heralded by a nice neon
sign outside. This sign is neatly
hidden round a corner in a
corridoor, so as not to upset the
various stone gods and goddesses
in the next gallery along. The
Boilerhouse changes it's displays
quite regularly, and in the short
time since it opened has achieved
some startling success.
The current exhibition is
National Characteristics in Design
Typically American Space Shuttle...
You can learn so much about the USA byjust looking at it can'tyou..
and it attempts to show how
industrial design, particularly of
mass market consumer goods,
shows national characteristics
which reflect and are reflected by
deep rooted traits in a particular
nation's collective consiousness.
Unfortunately this interpr-
etation ends up looking like pure
twaddle. This may seem a
sweeping generalisation but if you
think that's bad then just listen to
these two gems, taken more or
less at random from the catalogue
Like Germany, the USA is a
middle class country.
Sweden is a democratic yet
paternalistic country.
Either of these two beauties
would form the basis for a PhD in
sociology, yet here they are.
popping up as facts that barely
need to be stated, yet alone
justified.
The exhibition takes a selection
of eight developed countries and a
representative collection of things
that are 'designed'. We get,
therefore, a table full of American
food, another with Italian,
English, French etc., with the
whole thing being repeated with
motorcycles,clothes, and even
toiletries. After looking at a
powerful vacuum action Swedish
lavatory basin we learn that this
shows 'the evidence., of a
worthiness of intent discussed
elsewhere in the world but unlike
in Sweden never carried out'.
Although the derivation of real
truths about the French from a
disposable lighter may seem
funny enough, we must wait until
we learn of the relationship
between a Sony Walkman and a
Bonsai tree, as well as what can be
read into a packet of French
protections feminines before
finally concluding that what once
seemed a good idea has been
turned into Pseud City. The
choice of exhibits has been done
to confirm trivial strereotyping.
It is a real pity that the ideajust
does not work. The designs
themselves show many fascin-
ating trends, but nationalism does
not appear to be one of them. The
Obviously French disposable
lighter...
Robots exhibition a few months
ago recieved praise from all
quarters, and surely design really
is interesting. Within the environs
of the V&A the contrast with the
bits of stone and pieces of cloth
shows how a facelift for a
museum can mean a lot more
than a new roof and cleaning the
stonework outside.
The Boilerhouse is planning a
move to the Docklands soon,
which is a shame from the point of
view of students at IC. Even when
it is no longer a short walk down
Exhibition Road, and becomes a
long ride down the District Line,
it will be worth a visit. For
aspiring designers at IC even a
flawed exhibition such as this
should be mandatory, and if all
you do is buy the final product it
can be intriguing seeing how
much effort goes into designing a
coffee pot. Just don't attempt to
learn much about the Italians
from it.
