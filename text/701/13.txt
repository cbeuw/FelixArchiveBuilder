SAILING
IC Victory
A team from the Sailing Club
travelled to Holland to compete
in the Tilburg International team
racing competition, over Easter.
With a total of three English
teams entering, and the usual
strong entry from the Dutch
Universities it was obviously
going to be difficult to match our
convincing victory last year.
The sailing, held on a lake in
the middle of a safari park,
surpassed all expectations. The
first race against Leiden saw
Jones execute a masterful port
tack start and cross the entire
fleet, only to be recalled on a
technicality. Leiden sailed a
different course to most of the
Imperial team but Bevans
appraisal of the situation meant
Imperial held a narrow lead
through-out.
Sheffield A, the current
National Polytechnic Cham-
pions, faced Imperial next.
Seconds before the start,
contrary to all predictions, the
wind picked up to a healthy force
6, and seconds after the start
Brimlow and Leon wiped out.
Conditions continued to
deteriorate, and racing was
abandoned.
The following day dawned with
a more moderate wind but heavy
snow. Bevan, sailing the aptly
named 'Un peu bleu' led the team
to victory after victory. Sheffield
B, Nautikos and Utretch all fell
victim to an Imperial team fueled
with chip butties. Bevan's
agressive tactics of sinking the
opposition, combined with
Jones's ability to bribe the
organisation, paid dividends as
the Imperial team reached the
finals.
Overnight conditions had
changed drastically; 'Twister'
Leon was undisputed 'Pinball
King' and Rudge and Burrows
were unbeaten at table football.
Brimlow was still searching in
vain for some Yorkshire
Pudding. It was a very, very
confident Imperial team which
met Sheffield A the following day
in the decisive race. Approach-
ing the first mark Imperial held 2,
3, 4 but Brimlow stopped to
relocate the buoy. With Imperial
now in a losing 2, 3, 6 position
Bevan and Jones set off after the
leading Sheffield boat. At the
final mark some totally unsubtle
pumping by Jones enabled him
to obtain an overlap, and soon
Imperial gained a victorious 1, 2,
6 combination. This was a
superb result against a team that
had lost only one race in the last
year.
The tournament was as
enjoyable as ever, and all who
went look forward to competing
again next year.
RIFLE
Young guns
go for it
Full-bore, if you didn't know,
means real, grown-up bullets. Big
ones. We can't use them in the
sports centre without sending
them through the wall, into the
basement of Student Services.
Hands up, Michael Arthur, we
want your money.
This is a challenging event in
several ways. The competition is
held over 300 and 600 yards. The
equipment is unfamiliar. The
shooter's ability counts for
everything—no advantage can
be gained by using a favourite,
souped-up gun. And the climate
is weird. In the one day, we had
wind, rain, sun, mist and snow.
Remember that telescopic sights
are a no-no, which makes poor
light a serious blow.
Scoring was by aggregate of
the best four members in each
team, resulting in a victory for
RCS with 332 points, followed by
Guilds with 297, and RSM with
285. In fairness, it has to be said
that there were only the
minimum four members in the
Mines team, but then how many
Miners would you trust with a
firearm?
There was a trophy for the
best marksman of the day. So
how to go about getting it? There
are differing approaches to
shooting. The most basic
involves making oneself comfy,
then just pulling the trigger. This
is at best only fairly successful.
The next stage of sophistication
is practised by most shooters.
Put your elbows in such-and-
such a place, hold your breath,
use an eyepatch, don't hang on
target for more than six seconds,
concentrate on the trigger, and
so on. The big snag is that all this
technical stuff induces stress in
the sportsman. Think it
over—the barrel must not shake
in the slightest, or the shot will
stray. Nervous fingers just aren't
steady enough for the best
result. The Zen approach is the
only way for the expert. The
whole being of the shooter
focussed in the tip of his fingers.
An undergraduate from
Aeronautics department got it
just right—the only sign of life
whilst he was sighting, being the
gleam of his eyes in the gathering
dark. The snow which fell on
Paul Claydon was last to melt
when the sun came out. He
accepted the award with middle-
distance gaze and twitchy smile
of a man who is, frankly, more
content behind a gun than
anywhere else. He slept
thoughtout the return journey,
eyes switching open only at the
sound of breech-blocks being
put into store.
TRACK & FIELD
Athletics squad
proposed
John Pope, track and field
secretary for the Cross-Country
Club, has been appointed to
encourage wider support for
track and field athletics within
College.
Support at present is
disappointing considering the
part the activity plays in the
'professional' sporting calender.
Furthermore, there is talent and
interest which could be
combined to produce a strong
College team.
The one major event for
College athletics this season is
on 30 April/1 May and so we
need as much support as
possible very soon. Two
evenings of competition are all
that is asked, be you world
superstar or competent jogger.
The latter may well be more
important as Goldsmith's won
last year purely by fielding a
complete squad. John Pope is
not alone in thinking that
Imperial can field a better squad
and hope it will. If people are
prepared to turn up for this event
please contact John or Cross-
Country Club via the Union
Office.
The long term intention is to
form a track and field athletic
squad, but this is the ideal time to
assess support and for
introductions to be made. People
can be entered for their fixtures if
they wish as well.
Will two evenings of revision
make that much difference to
exam results?
