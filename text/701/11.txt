DRAMSOC
Dramsoc Summer Tour
During the Summer, Dramsoc goes on Tour.
This year three plays are being taken to the
Edinburgh Festival Fringe and Dramsoc will
take part in the World's largest arts festival,
performing alongside both amateur and
professional groups. Auditions for the three
plays will take place on Friday 26 April at
7.30pm in the Union Dining Hall (1st floor,
Union Building). If you have ever thought of
acting, the details of the Tour are detailed
below.
The three plays are Funeral Games a
black comedy by Joe Orton (four male, one
female), Unify by Jane Anning (two female,
one male) and You're A Good Man Charlie
Brown (three males, two females). Anyone is
welcome to audition.
Rehearsals for the plays begin in the
middle of June after the exams have finished.
They take place during the evenings,
enabling people to take full time jobs. All
members of the casts are required in London
for these rehearsals. The festival begins, with
the theatre venue being converted from
Saturday 3 August, at which point the
rehearsals cease and equipment is taken to
Edinburgh. The first performances begin on
Thursday 8 Auguest, with press previews
and continue during the subsequent three
weeks. The plays by Orton and Anning are
performed on alternate nights from August 8
to August 24. You're A Good Man... is
performed each lunchtime from August 25 to
August 31, when the festival finishes.
Accommodation in Edinburgh is usually in
flats, with rent being about £30 per week.
Other costs are transport to Edinburgh and
obviously food and drink. So if you have no
other plans for the Summer and are
interested in acting, come along to the
auditions. If you have any questions or
doubts either drop me a note (Nick
Shackley, Chem Eng 3) or come along on
Friday. For anyone interested in acting, this
is an opportunity not to be missed.

QTSOC
Silly Season
Due to pressure of work, the weakness of the
Dollar and the fall of Stoke City, QT will be
having a moderately quiet term. Summer
however is the silly season and events will be
arranged in the open air, usually in Hyde
Park. These will include raving at Speakers
Corner and Donald's walkabout by the
Round pond. Any other ideas aimed at
annoying tourists will be gratefully received.
Meetings will be held as usual on
Tuesdays, 1pm, Southside Upper Lounge
for the next few weeks.
PS Sorry no jokes this week.
PPS If anybody knows where the pillocks
from PPSoc are, then we are still waiting for
our pillow fight.
ICCND
AGM
ICCND has no events organised for this
term except the Annual General Meeting
where members can receive their late
membership cards and stand for various
committee posts. It will take place on
Wednesday May 8 at 12.45pm in the Union
Upper Lounge.
It can be great fun organising and running
a club as a team, so if you want to help you
can drop a note to ICCND in the Union
Office.
At the AGM the art and literature prizes
will be given out and the maybe some
entertainment. So come along and support
your ICCND group. Without you there may
not be one next year!
Bookshop
News
First the bad news. Due I am sure, to a small
number of people who 'borrow' books from
the Bookshop we have had to install a
complete closed circuit television system in
the shop. As the shop is owned by the Union
the cost of installing this will mean that this
reflects on our profits, so remember while
you are watching, so is my staff.
Now the good news, the Christmas best
seller Mans Best Friend £2.95, is once again
available. Rumour has it that a follow up will
appear later in the year. If and when it does
you will be the first to know.
For the next two weeks there will be in our
window an exhibition of Engineering and
Physics books published by John Wiley and
sons Ltd. If you wish to see any book from
the window please ask my staff and they will
get them out for you.
New Titles
The story of Air Fighting Air Vice-Marshal J
E 'Johnnie' Johnson published by
Hutchinson at £9.95.
This book, by one of the greatest Air
Fighters of them all, tells the story of fighting
in the air from the First World War to the
present day. It is full of thrilling first hand
stories of courage and accounts of many of
the legendary Flying Ace's. Publication date
is April 29 and hopefully I will have signed
copies. If you wish to order one, please come
