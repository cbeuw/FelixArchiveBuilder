CFELIX;
What did you do this
weekend?
-and d i d y o u e n j o y i t ?
London can be an exciting place to
live—but only if you know the ropes. In
October several hundred fresh faced first
years will arrive at Imperial College and you
can help them enjoy their first few weeks
here to the full.
A few weeks before the start of the academic year all first
year students receive a copy of the IC Union Handbook.
Can you pass on information to help them in their first
year? Whether you want to review a favourite
restaurant.pub or cinema.discuss the merits of the local
shops or write an article on study skills there is a place for
everything. If you are the Chairman/Captain of a club or
society you are also required to submit a short article
detailing your activities and facilities(see pidgeon holes
for details). General photographs of college and local
events are particularly useful.
If you are at all interested in passing on your knowledge
and advice please contact Nigel Atkinson vid the Felix
office as soon as possible. The copy deadline will be
Friday 31st May.

Once upon a time a mathematician decided to learn to play
golf.
After his first shot he sat down, got out a pencil and started to
work out his shortest route to the next tee.
One of the mathematicians strong points was his sense of
space, given any two points he could visualise any of the
ellipses for which the said points are foci. Using this amazing
ability he noticed that the position of his ball and the hole were
exactly at the foci of the elliptical green.
He must now walk to the edge of the green, leave his bag, hole
his ball and retrieve it, then take his bag to the next tee. How can
he work out his shortest route?

I have one solution to the Easter puzzles, for the spider fly
problems. I will leave the other two prizes open until Monday 6
May in case anyone can solve them, though I expect you are too
busy with exams, just now.
