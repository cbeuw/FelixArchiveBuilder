JAZZ
It has been a long time since Mahavishnu Orchestra have made
any noticeable impact on the heavily pock-marked British jazz
scene. With titles like The Flowers of Spring it's hardly
surprising. Now, it seems, they have brushed off their
memorable—but historical—psychedelic jazz image, shaken
the last few hippies from their coat tails and waxed
saxophonical. The band is headed as ever by the incredibly
versatile John McLaughlin, trading acoustic guitar for clarinet
and synthesised guitar, and Billy Cobham, reputed by some, to
be the worlds greatest (although perhaps not the fastest)
drummer. But, for sheer heat and rhythm, saxophonist Bill
Evans, already an established mainstream jazz musician, has
laid down a remarkable selection of up-beat and ballad riffs for
the set, each one dripping in vitality.
No, that's not entirely true, old habits die hard, and some
tracks {The Unbeliever sounding suspiciously like some like
some live-music Miles Davis wrote some ten years ago, and
When Blue Turns to Gold still retains their subdued nature; but
none of the eight tracks meander. They are well structured,
compact, tight as a drum.
The new Mahavishnu is hardly a British venture. In addition to
Cobham and Evans, McLaughlin uses two lesser known
Scandinavian musicians for keyboard and basswork.
Everything I said about Scandinavia being the home of jazz die-
hards and hippies I take back a hundred fold, oh, I don't know
though. They've got to live somewhere. Maybe that's how this
new Mahavishnu thing all started....
SINGLES m ^

Howard Jones: Look Mama
Despite repeated claims by
his army of fans that Howard
Jones's songwriting talents
are many and varied, I have to
admit to being bored to tears
with the tedious What is love
sound that permeates virtually
every track on the Dream Into
Action album. It was great the
first time, even ok on the
second, but unfortunately
Look Mama has little to
recommend it for repeated
listening.
F r e e e z : That Beats My
Patience
Freeez MK 111 seem to have
reformed in name only: the
style and depth of this new
single fortunately has none of
the electro 'bob pop' ofAElOU
and Pop Goes Your Love but
instead a light funky feel and
an attractively soft lead vocal.
A bit bland admittedly, but
good dance music for us non-
soul freaks.
I Start Counting: Still Smiling
The second release from
Mute's new Depeche Mode
soundalikes, this does show a
remarkable (and surprising)
o r i g i n a l i t y . It's a l m o s t
Yazooish in interpretation,
and with excellent mix down
by Femi J . I like it!
Wooden Tops: Move Me
Before you move on to a
review of a known band, do
give this a chance.I think
Woodentops could be the new
A z t e c C a m e r a of 1 9 8 5 .
Already supporting bands like
Everything but The Girl and
Orange Juice, this is their
second single, and the first on
Rough Trade. It probably
won't be successful yet, but
just watch this band...
It's that time of year. When a
young man's fancy turns to
love and he does more with
his nights than argue about
who's got all the duvet. Search
out the sunglasses from
behind the dusty Christmas
decorations. The old, sticky
bottle of Pimm's from the back
of the larder. Ice in the fridge
instead of coins in the meter.
And^the living will be easy...
Once these last few weeks
of academic angst have gone,
w h a t t h e n ? C l e a n e r in
Southside? O h , be serious.
Industrial training? Writing
programs (sic) for a fifth-
generation t e a s m a i d . Not
again. What you need is a
holiday. A n d because we at
FELIX like to be of service, we
will show you some books to
send you on your way and a
few to read when you get
there.
Yes, I wish they all could be
Caledonian girls. I would
gladly Fly the Flag, and let
them give me a flight so good I
won't want to get off. The only
snag is that I'm skint. My
American Express card has
melted, and the Service Till
prints 'Fuck Off You Little
Creep' every time I put my
numbers in. 'C'est la vie' as
they say in France. 'Versprung
Durch Technic' as they say at
Nat West. The only way for us
paupers is via the Hitch-
hiker's guide to Europe by
Ken Welsh, now in its tenth
edition. If you already have
the old model, it isn't worth
getting, because the more
o b v i o u s a l t e r a t i o n s — t h e
exchange rates—are well up
the creek by now. Otherwise
this book is a must, even if
your Mum won't let you hang
around with lorry-drivers.
Essentially, it tells you how to
export the student life-style,
but don't let that put you off.
Over the years, Ken Welsh has
b u i l t u p a f a s c i n a t i n g
collection of scams, dodges
and downright skulduggery
which will help you get by on
very little besides your own
nerve. For the faint-hearted,
there are also lists of place to
eat, sleep and act like atourist.
If you are going by car, you
may have been tempted by
A r t h u r E p e r o n ' s b o o k s
—Traveller's France, Travel-
ler's Italy, and so forth. My
advice is 'don't bother'. Their
premise is obvious: stay off
the Motorways. Beyond that,
the books list a few routes
throught the relevant country,
with recommended restaur-
ants and hotels along the way.
Of less use, but very freaky
is No Need to Die by Eddie
McGee. If you are hassled by
the Pigs in Amsterdam, The
Hitch-Hiker's Guide to Europe
will suffice. If you are hassled
by the Pygmies in the Andes,
you need McGee's book. That
and aservicable shotgun. The
d r a w b a c k s a r e i r r i t a t i n g
— p o o r d i a g r a m s , s e m i -
literate commentary, much
too big and heavy for a
practical survival guide. The
ideas, though, are fantastic.
An insight into a completely
different way of life, living off
the land. Tracking animals.
Tracking people. O d d stuff,
but strangely compelling. Any
man who has trapped snakes
for food deserves the royalties
from his books, and I certainly
wouldn't want him turning up
at our office to complain
about a nasty review. There
are no recipies for quiche in
this book.
So what do you take to read
for the boring bits—night-
flights and so on? Well, I will
try to read Joyce's Ulysses for
the third summer in a row. Bet
I fall asleep by page 50. For
i n s o m n i a c s , t h e c h o i c e
usually includes at least one
or two 'thrillers'—the thrills
usually deflated by the six-
inch nails which hold the plot
together. However, there is a
sub-genre which is reliably
better than the average; the
journalistic spy story. Why it is
so popular is a bit of a mystery
in itself. I suspect that the best
e x a m p l e s s u c c e e d b y
p r o v i d i n g a p l a u s i b l e
framework for headline events
which may be difficult to
understand in isolation. Spy-
masters playing huge games
of logic have the same,
s i m p l i f y i n g a p p e a l a s
mathematics, Santa Claus, or
extremist politics. It often
seem that people find plurality
discomforting; the friendly,
authoritative v o i c e of a
j o u r n a l i s t o r p o l i t i c i a n
spinning a yearn without
loose ends can seem more
real than reality itself. It is
o f t e n a m u s i n g to r e a d
passages on an author's
political enemies. In the
context of fiction, a more
e v e n - h a n d e d a p p r o a c h
applies than that found in
directly discoursive pieces. If
f a c e d w i t h a n a i r p o r t
bookstall, have a look at the
nonsence churned-out by
Hurd and Osmond, or perhaps
Gerald Seymour (who wrote
Harry's Game).
