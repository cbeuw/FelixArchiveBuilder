IMPERIAL COLLEGE qualified for the finals of University
Challenge on Monday by beating Birmingham in the quarter
finals and Edinburgh in the semi-finals. This followed their
victories over Somerville College, Oxford and Queens, Belfast,
before Easter. The team, comprising Dick Langstaff (captain),
Tim Williams, Simon Errington and Duncan Swan, have been
accompanied by enthusiastic supporters from College on each of
the three nights that they have competed at the Granada TV
Studios in Manchester. The final will be played on Tuesday 30
April.
There were some nail-biting
moments for IC, but all the team
members contributed equally,
with very few wrong answers.
Regular watchers of University
Challenge have observed less of a
bias towards the arts this year, in
the questions. In previous years,
science questions have tended to
be trivial, whereas a detailed
knowledge of the arts has been
required
Question master Bamber
Gascoigne seemed surprised by
IC's micrometer 'Mike' which he
described as 'much the heaviest
mascot to appear on the
programme'.
How they reached the finals
In the first round IC beat
Sommerville College, Oxford by
485 to 225, then Queens, Belfast
by 280 to 240. In the quarter-final
they beat Birmingham 260 to 200
and in the semi-final beat
Edinburgh 365 to 210. Jesus
College beat Cains 545 to 440,
followed by Birmingham 310 to
255. They beat Cardiff in the
semi-final 285 to 250.
This is only the third time that
a London College has reached
the final, and if Imperial win, it
will be a first for the University.
Fifty supporters will attend the
finalâ€”Jen has a list.
NUS take
control
IC BAR PRICES may rise
substantially after a National
Student Services Organisation
was founded during the second
Student Services Conference at
Birmingham University during the
Easter Vacation.
The new NUS organised body
will take over negotiation with
national suppliers of, for
example, beer, to obtain
substantial discounts for the
student unions involved. This
replaces the Bars Working Party
through whom Imperial obtains
discounts on beer, spirits, wine
and soft drinks, as well as other
consortia involving paper
supplies, stationary, food, and so
on. The new body will exclude
unions not in NUS from
benefiting from these discounts
as from 1 Janaury 1987.
Right from the start of the
conference it was clear that petty
student politics were more
important to the majority of the
delegates than commerical sense
and benefits. Despite dogged
attempts by the ULU, QMC,
Chelsea UCL and IC delegates,
the conference moved the
exclusion amendment. This was
passed by 33 votes to 32 (after
two recounts).
