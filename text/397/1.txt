President caught
winking!
Last Saturday morning, Mr P e t e r
T e a g u e , (of no fixed address), President
of IC Union was caught single-handedly
WINKING in Oxford Street, W1. When
approached, Mr Teague (who carried on
winking) was heard to say, 'I've always
done it, and I think that more people at
IC should participate'. When asked why
he was doing it, he said, 'For those blind
people, less fortunate than myself, who
through no fault of their own cannot wink
any longer'.
Mr Teague was taken to Bow Street
police station where he was charged with
winking on the Queen's highway under
section 41.
In a written statement, he asked for
221 other o f f e n c e s to be taken into
consideration. These included one of
organising a vendetta against one grease
merchant and wholesale distributor of
c o c k c r o a c h e s who wished to remain
anonymous, but whose family motto is
"Overchargeand undercook".
Later, Mr Keith Ahlers, the President
of City and Guilds Union, and himself a
born winker, joined Mr Teague and together
they proceeded to wink down Regent
Street, causing much havoc and a mess on
the pavement.
