Looking back on
" T a k e S p i n n h V
T h i s is the 5th album from Weather
Report — one of the t o p - l i g h t jazz
groups whose popularity over the last
few years has increased with the release
of a couple of funky, less extreme, L P ' s .
They are jointly led by Joe Z a w i n u i , an
assorted keyboards and s y n t h e s i s e r s , and
Wayne Shorter on saxophone, two members
of the modern jazz hierarchv who have
played with likes of Miles D a v i s and
Herbie H a n c o c k . More than able support
is provided by Dom Urn Romao (percussion)
A l p h o n s o Johnson (bass), and Ishmuel
Wilbum (drums).
The album expands the current trend
Into the funkier, more rnvthmically-
orientated regions of jazz that were first
attempted on "Sweetnighter" a n d then
adopted for the major part of "Mysterious
Traveller", their 3rd and 4th albums
respectively A good d e c i s i o n — c o n s i d e r i n g
the first two albums dispensed with the
idea of a main theme and concentrated,
rather e x c e s s i v e l y , on the creation of
mood and atmosphere as the substance of
a number. They were creating sound
effects with nothing tobring them together
except for the occasional moments when
Alphonze Mouzon's excellent drumming
took charge and provided a d i r e c t i o n .
Now they've sorted a l l that out —
concentrating on strong, melodic, tunes
with a discernible progression from start
to f i n i s h . Y o u don't have to posess a Phd
in music to understand it anymore .
"Man In a green shirt", the opening
track, is the best example, with insistent
drumming and equally powerful bass
attempting to move the song faster than
it wants to go but constantly having to

give in to the stength of the melody
line. A n excellent number whose feel is
continued through the rest of side one and
part of side two of s p e i c a l note are Dom
Urn Romao's contributions, constantly
adding colour and fullness to the sound.
In short, the album shows a more
organised, uncluttered approach to M u s i c ,
than Weather report's free-form leanings
of a few years ago. More control has been
imposed on "the sparks of Imagination that
used to wander off and "Tale Splnnio" is
an excellent reason for listening to this
band of undeniable stature and Integrity
who are at last finding a n aifdlence of
some magnitude.
..JethroTull's "A Passion Play"
C r i t i c s write glibly about the past-and-
present c l a s s i c s of music w h i l s t some-
times missing out the real gems under
their noses . A l m o s t a l l of them uniformly,
condemned this album as a technique-for-
techniques-sake l o s e r . F e w praises were
aired and Jethro F u l l , until then a highly
acclaimed and respected group were
bluntly handed their cards . Hatchet jobs
galore — but they were a l l wrong.
T h i s is a truly c l a s s i c a l b u m . It
rounds off the whole progression of T u l l
from the 1968 B l u e s roots of "This Was",
through that fine trio of waxings "Stand
Up", "Benefit", and "Aqualung", the
retrospective doub\e"Living In the past",
and then, c o n s c i o u s l y leaving the singles
jingles behind, "Thick as a brick" — a
well-constructed and interesting s l i c e of
Ian Anderson's talent which was popular
flexings of musical muscle and adventure
that were to be presented in more depth
and c o m p l e x i t y on "A Passion Play" .
It's not an album you can put on and
instantly like . A s with a l l the best things
an initial lack of understanding has to be
overcome by actually " l i s t e n i n g " to the
t h i n g . The music is not for the c a s u a l
ear but any trouble taken in s t i c k i n g with
the piece through repeated playings is
soon rewarded in f u l l . The genius and
c l a s s , initially hidden away by overlays
of faultless m u s i c i a n s h i p and the control
of the eccentric one-legged piper, is then
allowed to show itself. What at first may
have sounded mechanical and contrived —
Herbie Mann meets E L P — eventually
a l l o w s the main themes to come out of the
undergrowth, and the textural strengths of
the music have a chance to prove their
worth . It's a l l finely-boned. craftsman I ike
m u s i c - m a k i n g . Varied expeditions on
clarinet, saxophone, and flute, com-
plementary piano-work by John E v a n , and
metronomic precison-playing from
Barriemore Bar lour and Jeffrey Hammond-
Hammond combine to produce this
exceptional a l b u m . It didn't s e l l in millions
but much good music is hidden away,
ignored by the masses, while the rubbish
receives the bright-lights treatment .Now,
let's hear it folks for showaddywaddy!
at the time and is now regarded by many
as the band's best work before degenerating
into the self-indulgent extravagance of
"A Passion Play". In fact it is the
culmination that these albums were a l l
leading up to. "Thick as a brick" was
the trial run in full-length music over two
sides of vynyl and incorporated the first
Concerts
Daryl Hall and John Oats/Amazing
Blondel
New Victoria Theatre
Much to my misfortune, Amazing
Blondel seem to be the supporting act to
too many of the concerts I attend. After
much personel suffering I've found the
best policy to take when Blondel trundle
onto a stage, is to make straight for the
nearest source of refreshment (usually the
bar). However, having been despatched
by the Editor to review the entire proceed-
ings tor F E L I X , I took my life Into my
own hands and somehow managed to s i t
through the whole set .After a l I, I thought,
the dynamic duo had been augmented by
a bass-player and drummer, perhaps this
would liven up their usually tiresome
offerings, and maybe - just maybe, they
had written a song that didn't have to be
counted in with the proverbial ... a-one-a
two-e one-two-three-four!
I was wrong on both counts.
'We've got two guys up here with us
tonight who hav'nt played in a place this
size before', the man s a i d , 'one's an
undertaker and the other is a bricklayer'-
(after hearing them I had no reason to
dispute t h i s ) . ' O K , this Is a song that we
don't know (sic), it goes something like
this - a-one, a-two-a one-two-three-four'.
And s o it went on, every number-a-one a
-two » . * - - • for about the last half dozen
songs, the band suffering the acute
embarresment of having the time counted
in for them by a great percentage of the
a u d i e n c e .
It would seem that I'm not the only
one to have seen Amazing Blondel on
previous o c c a s i o n s , as the s i z e of the
audience q u i c k l y tripled on theirdeparture,
to await the arrival of Daryl H a l l and
John Oates for their first appearence on
a B r i t i s h s t a g e . T h e A m e r i c a n songwrltlng
duo, who by a l l accounts are about to
break it big in the States, flew in for a
one-off g i g to promote their new R C A
album, simply c a l l e d 'Daryl Hall and
John Oates'. Although not too widely
known in this country as yet, it was
evident from the reception they received
that with the release of two albums on
A t l a n t i c ('Abandon Luncheonette' and
'War Babies'*) they have built up a
considerable reputation.
Whilst Blondel took bandlty to Its
extreme, H a l l and Oates (together with
their four-piece band) showed the finer
points of s l i c k American profesionalism.
For the uninitiated, the music is tight
and w e l l arranged, placing the emphasis
on strong lyrical and melodic content, a
pleasant change from the endless'boogie
syndrome" that too many of their US
counterparts e x h i b i t . A good example
would to liken them to s a y , Steely D a n ,
although this might be unfair in s o much
as the duo's music is as Individual to
them as is Becker and Fagens to the
Dan's .
Most of the v o c a l i z i n g was done by
H a l l , w h o a l s o played electric piano and
the occasional mandolin, Oates taking the
slightly lesser role of rhythm guitar/
harmony v o c a l s , although on his few
outings singing the lead he handled the
situation more than competently.. The
band too, d i d nothing but enhance the
performance with their fine m u s i c i a n s h i p
and on-stage mannerisms, and It was
quite fitting that they were brought back
for two e n c o r e s .
With their new single ' C a m e l l i a ' , being
given quite a few radio plays, (although
far too good to make our tepid charts) the
name of H a l l and Oates should spread a
a little further, and in s o doing, perhaps
entice the duo to return for further U K gigs .
If they choose to do, then they should not
be m i s s e d at any c o s t .
