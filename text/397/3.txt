So here we are back to the old " t r a i n t r a i n " of life, back from
our holidays, having spent them " i n t e r - r a i l i n g " round Europe,
s a i l i n g to Brittany, mining in South-Africa or just plain temping in
South Kensington!
However, if a three month
tour of Spain for only £2 grabs
y o u . . .
Going abroad is expensive,
but there are ways and means
(with -the help of NUS T r a v e l ,
or, if you are that badly off,
with the help of your right
thumb) of'spending a reasonable
period of time abroad for next
to nothing.
T h i s I discovered this
summer, when I went on an
international work camp in
Spain . T h e s e operate in almost
every country in the w o r l d .
Board and lodging is free, and
work is easy and hours
extreme ly short.
I set off for Barcelona in
early July and arrived in
Geneva through boarding the
wrong train A n y w a y , I eventually
arrived in Barcelona at eleven
o'clock at n i g h t . It was dark,
and on finding what I thought
was a camp s i t e , pitched my
tent, only to be awakened next
day by several bewildered-
looking deigo cub-scouts
armed with s t i c k s and " p e l o t a "
bats! I muttered a couple of
" p e r d o n a ' s " and promptly
made my exit!
The work had been described
on my application form as
" c o n s t r u c t i o n w o r k " , but when
I arrived at the work camp I
realised that there.had been a
mistake. Apparently, my name
had been translated as C a r l o s ,
and I had therefore " c h a n g e d
s e x " somewhere between
England and S p a i n ! So there I
was stranded on a building site
with only a pick axe, preumatlc
d r i l l , and a fine selection of
wel I tanned brickies as company.
My workmates proved to be
really kind and exceptionally
w e l l behaved. On the ether
hand, the accommodation was
definitely rough.
After three weeks of pure
sweat, a very apologetic
administrator arrived at the
camp. A s compensation for his
error, I was taken to a l l the
work camps in Spain, and from
what I learnt and saw I can
recommend t h e m . Of course,
they are by no means luxury
holiday resorts, but so much
can be learnt from the people
one meets.
My work included cutting
pines in the Pyrenees,
