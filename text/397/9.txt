Greenslade In The Great Hall
A large appreciative crowd attended'
thjs, the first IC Ents gig of the s e s s i o n .
Greenslade were the main attraction with
P h i l l l p G o o d h a n d - T a i t a s support.
He entertained the audience with a
medley of songs on piano and harmonium.
After a q u i c k pint In the Union B a r
(during the interval) I came back to hear
Greenslade. They are a band with a fine
musical pedigree, including former
members of C o l l i s e u m and King C r i m s o n ,
they somehow failed to live up to
expectations. Although technically
immaculate, they didn't really play with
any great c o n v i c t i o n .
They came on stage proceeded by the
inevitable pre-recorded tapes and were
straight into 'Gatalan' from their last
album 'Time and Tide'. It failed miser-
ably as a s i n g l e but was given a good
readition on this o c c a s i o n .
The next time w h c i h sounded like an
L P recording — as did most of their other
songs — was c a l l e d 'Sun of Spirit' w h i c h
w i l l be featured on their forth coming
a l b u m . They then slipped back into time,
and for the rest of the concert played
tracks from their previous four a l b u m s .
Of note were the times from their
second album 'Bedside Manners Are
Extra'. These included 'The Ass's Ear',
'Spirit of the Dance' (which they played
for an encore) and 'Drumfolk'. The latter
being a rather poor take-off of B i l l y
Cobham's style of drumming.
Thus ended the first gig at IC and a l l
Un a l l must be considered a s u c c e s s . I
'look forward to many more.
Theatre
Look Back In Anger
Pandora Theatre is a new company,
formed by old members of IC Dramatic
S o c i e t y . In their first production, which
can be seen tonight and tomorrow in the
Union Concert H a l l , they give us a
powerful rendition of John Osborne's
modern c l a s s i c "Look Back in Anger",
directed by Richard K i n g .
Jimmy Porter has becime a legend In
his own lifetime as the original aogry
man. Mark Frank holds our attention as
he b r i l l i a n t l y balances his humour,
seeking the sympathy of the audience,
against the Imperative tyranny over
his mlsfortunate wife, A l i s o n , Beneath
these public faces lies a sense of concern
for A l i s o n and tor C l i f f , caught in the
no-man's-land between, which may at
times seem too c r e d i b l e . Penny Grove
plays A l i s o n with the remarkable restraint
which the part requires; more than once I
felt Impelled to stand up and s i l e n c e
Jimmy's haranguing but her quiet fore-
bearance quelled me. Only at the end d i d
she break through and scream the house
down, unfortunately becoming u n i n t e l l i g -
ible In the process.
Perhaps the character the audience
finds most hateful Is Helena (Frances
Brinton), the archetypal C o o l busybody
who stands up to Jimmy, though not for
long. She is the c a t a l y s t without whom
the play could not fire and Miss Brlnton's
cold blooded approach is frightening:
Denys Bennett plays C l i f f with an
air of long experience, he has seen It a l l
happen s o many t i m e s . H i s control at the
news that A l i s o n Is pregnant Is Impressive.
He Is the datum line from w h i c h the
violence of the others may be measured.
E r i c Stove It's brief appearance a s
A l i s o n ' s father shows an elderly man,
not equipped for the situation in which
he finds himself. H i s actions are studied
and correct.
' Look B a c k I n Anger* has been dated
by the renaissance w h i c h It began. Once
Osborne had opened the floodgates by
revealing, <o the theatre - going middle
c l a s s e s , what post war youth w a s really
up to there was no stopping the tide of
the -kitchen s i n k . Today it is difficult to
imagine how shocked the audiences of
twenty years ago must have been, but
nobody c a n go to the concert hall this
week without having their emotions roused
by a very forceful production.

Freshers' Fair by Riz Shakir, ICU DP
A large number of freshers attended the fair, hence from my
personal point of view the fair was quite s u c c e s s f u l . However,
one or two things which emerged from it warrant some comment.
F i r s t l y a considerable number of clubs and s o c i e t i e s did not
bother to f i l l in and return their forms, but turned up on the day
and expected everything to be laid on for them. I tried to a c c o m -
modate them as best a s I c o u l d , at the risk of it playing havoc
with the index which had to be altered as late as one o ' c l o c k on
Tuesday morning.
I would plead with the new officials to put in their forms
before the end of the summer term, s o that next year the D P does
not have to s c r a p his plans and start again just because twenty or
s o clubs have decided to a s k for stand at the last moment.
I am aware that their was a shortage of tables, however .there
seems no easy solution to this s i n c e we cannot borrow enough
tables from the rest of college and to buy tables for use on one
day in a year is hardly p r a c t i c a l . I am looking into the p o s s i b i l i t y
of renting tables and w i l l forward my findings to my s u c c e s s o r .
One d i s t r e s s i n g thing on the Freshers F a i r was the fact that a
considerable number of clubs and societies completely ignored my
instructions and put up posters with tape. The fact of the matter
is that over £3000 of both College and Union money has been
spent on redecoration of the building this summer. My view may
seem somewhat harsh, but I think a small minority of irresponsible
club officials should not be allowed to destroy the outlook for the
rest of students. I am therefore taking the matter to Council and
the offenders will be appropriately penalised.
I would like to make it clear to everybody w i s h i n g to put up
posters in the Union B u i l d i n g that they should either be put up on
the notice boards or Blue tac should be used. A n y c l u b , society,
or individual in breach of this would be p e n a l i s e d . T h e form of
this w i l l be considered by C o u n c i l .
A t this point I think I owe a l l of you a n apology for having
made a n ill-prepared and misrepresentative statement in my haste
(over the P A system) during the F a i r .
I would like to stress that I feel strongly about c l u b s and
s o c i e t i e s granting free membership to freshers for the first few
weeks of the s e s s i o n . I w i l l be taking my proposal to C o u n c i l
and try to get policy on this stating that c l u b s / s o c i e t i e s must not
charge freshmen any subscription until a few weeks into term.
T h i s w i l l enable the freshers to get acquainted with the f a c i l i t i e s
that the c l u b provides and/or the types of functions it organises.
In this way a more active membership should result and make
sure that the hierarchy of the club/society cater for a l l Interests
and are not holding the position just to obtain p r i v i l i g e s .
F i n a l l y , I would like to encourageclubs/societies to hold more
functions and every student at IC to participate in the Union t o a
greater extent. The Union not only needs you for It to be strong
and representative, but it provides you with a variety of f a c i l i t i e s
to help y o u in your everyday life.
