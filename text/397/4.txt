Imagine my surprise when a rather pale looking, six mile
long creature walked into my office on Wednesday morning and
said, " H e l l o Gobber!" The fellow I'm referring to is of course
John Downs. It is good to have him back with us for the Union
Office has not been the same without his zanny sense of
humour.
Accommodation
The 'crash pad' scheme run by the Union was quite
successful although not many students had to avail themselves
of it. Those who did were mainly overseas students, many of
whom thought that they automatically received a place in
College residence once they are accepted onto a course at IC.
I feel that this completely erroneous impression, which one
assumes is obtained from tbe bumph sent out by College,
ought to be cleared up. This will greatly reduce the confusion
and consternation caused to all concerned.
Food Guide
I promised a quid to whoever could prove they had eaten
in the 'Contented Sole' in last week's F E L I X . I now have
three people who have done, but due to my poor financial
status I shall not be giving away anymore quids. At least you
read the guide which was tbe main idea. Thanks for your
interest.

Why should they Imagine
that anyone Is interested In the
marital status of the female
staff? F o r those of you
unfamiliar or uninterested, the
use of Ms (pronounced Mlz) as
opposed to Miss or Mrs, is
important to many women —
therefore should be adopted on
request.
When I was getting my
library tickets from the Haldane
the chard had a choice of Prof/
Doctor/Mr/Mrs/Miss (please
note the order). I crossed out
the first three . The librarian
looked at me c l o s e l y and
proceeded to write M i s s in
large letters on my t i c k e t s .
When I protested she said she
didn't want me to be mistaken
for a m a n . Curious logic that!
