A R I E S (22Mar-21Apr): A r i a n s have no difficulty in falling in
love .More often they go for physica l attractiveness. They always
believe i t ' s the real thing! Their ardent, impatient and impulsive
nature can lead to fast and many affairs .Swinging parties, d i s c o s
and entertainment places are usually their scene . A love affair
with an A r i a n could be quite adventurous and passionate!!
T A U R U S (21Apr-21 May): Taureans are both passionate and
p r a c t i c a l . They are very careful on the first few dates and w i l l
hardly d i s c l o s e any emotions until the time Is right. Once in love
they are often devoted and w i l l i n g to do just about anything (oh
yes!) to keep their loved one content .Owing to their possesive
nature they demand loyalty .
GEMINI (22May—21 Jun): They usually enjoy v e r s a t i l i t y intheir
love a f f a i r s . Anything boring is o u t ! . Their charming, lively and
witty nature attracts many members of the opposite sex . T h e y are
hardly shy and c a n have several romances running at the same
t i m e . In fact they just can't help winning hearts. Remember Don
Juan was a Gemini . A n d s o w a s lady Casonova .
C A N C E R (23Jun—23Jul); Under their apparently hard exterior
they are really s h y and e m o t i o n a l . They hardly make the first
move to start a n affair, Instead they wait for y o u . Because they
are subject to changing moods the affair may go through many
phases. Nonetheless, they are s e n s i t i v e , romantic though often
lack passion.
L E O ( 2 4 J u l - 2 3 A u g ) : Loves magestically. Generous both with
gifts and a f f e c t i o n . E a s i l y flattered. H a s no restriction about
starting an affair anywhere, anytime. P h y s i c a l attraction Is very
important to them. They d i s l i k e to be c r i t i c i z e d or ignored in any
way by their loved-one. They are passionate and p o s s e s i v e . A n d
guess w h o w a s a Leo? Napolean Bonaparte .
V I R G O (24Aug-23Sep); Their practical, prudent and patient
nature is reflected in their love life.They dorft wear their hearts
on their s l e e v e s . If they fall in love, they initially conceal their
feelings in c a s e of rebuff. Small gifts are highly treasured and
words of affection remembered. Rather than chasing nebulous
dreams, they'd look for a needle in a hay-stack (and probably
find it too!)
L I B R A ( 2 3 S e p - 2 3 0 c t ) : Their attractive outlook and harmon-
ious nature are more than enough to spark an affair. However,
they'd rather stay friends for a time before any involvement .They're
often indecisive and need to weigh the pros and cons of just
about everything . They are charmed by unusual people and like to
have some interest in common.
S C O R P I O ( 2 4 0 c t - 2 2 N o v ) : T h i s is the most emotional and
passionate s i g n in love. Their magnetic personality and hypnotic
eyes capture many hearts. Their love is penetrating and sensuous
provided it's genuine. They are loyal to their partner. Owing to
their possesive nature they can be jealous and s u s p i c i o u s . James
Bond and Grace K e l l y are t y p i c a l Scorpios.
S A G I T T A R I U S (23Nov-22Dec): Sagittarians are usually too
independent to fall in love deeply. They like to be on the move
and enjoy a romance (or two) in the background as long as it
doesn't tie them. Their affections are often e a s i l y captured but
when the initial heat cools they loose interest. They are loved
by many and tend to love many.
C A P R I C O R N ( 2 3 D e c - 2 0 J a n ) : Their s h y nature usually makes
them calculating in love a f f a i r s . They are highly aware of the
opposite s e x . Once in love they w i l l use any strategy to capture
the loved o n e . They don't require a common interest but prefer a
contrast. They get out of embarrasing situations by their incon-
grous sense of humour. They are the most loyal of a l l the s i g n s .
A Q U A R I U S (21 Jan—19Feb); Their charming, s e n s i t i v e and
idealistic nature is reflected in their love life. They usually have
a good humour and are very generous. If they feel they're going to
be bored in any way they just move away. They often look for a
common interest. Their sudden and w i l d enthusiasm could lead to
adventurous a f f a i r s .
P I S C E S (20Feb-21Mar): Their tender hearts are readily
c a p t u r e d . Gentle and s e n s i t i v e nature may lead to emotional
untidiness in their love affairs. They are impressionable and
e a s i l y flattered. They enjoy glamour. Not only romantic and
affectionate but a l s o p a s s i o n a t e . They can be e a s i l y hurt. Often
very generous. Sometimes tend to be forgetful. L i z a Minelli is a
typical P i s c e s (glamour?!)
