Southside Refectory
surrounded
by our Grime Reporter.
As the siege of the famous London spaghetti house,
"Southside Refectory" moves into its third week, the
police today revealed the identity of the vicious gunman
who is holding 4,000 students hostage, as Victor (or
"Cockroach") Mooney, a man well known in underworld
circles for this type of crime. Tension remained high as
reports came through that the gunman was in a nervous,
irritable state, facing deteriorating sanitary conditions •
and forced by lack of food to eat refectory meals.
What started off a s a
simple attempt to rob 4,000
students of their grants by
charging r i d i c u l o u s l y high
prices for Inedible food has
developed into one of the most
difficult c a s e s the police in
this area have ever had to
handle. They are following a
" l o w p r o f i l e " , " n o n - p o l i t i c a l "
policy hoping that In the course
of time the gunman w i l l just
give himself u p .
Madman
The man in charge of the
police operation is Chief
Superintendent Peter Teague
(or " S u p e r " a s the general
public have come to know him)
He defended the present police
attitude of " w a i t and s e e "
when he s a i d " W e are obviously
dealing with a madman here
and care must be t a k e n . Ho
has '. , demanded
12p for a yoghurt and 15p for
a pork pie. God knows what
might happen if we moved i n ! "
Critics
However, this has failed to
silence c r i t i c s of police
inactivity w h o s a y that even
higher rahsom demands may
be made If tougher a c t i o n is
not taken .

Following the success of last year's sweepstake,
this venture will be continued, to finance an Easter
tour. The sweepstake operates by taking the first 20
rugby results from the 'Sunday Express'and numbering
them from 1 to 20. Each participant in the sweepstake
is allocated three of these numbers. The person with
the numbers corresponding to the highest aggregate of
points each week, wins £5.
The weekly entry fee is 10p and for the 25 Saturdays
of the College season the gentry fee is £2.50. A L L
club members are urged to participate to ensure a good
profit to finance the tour.
