Interview with Charles Clarke
N U S President
Charles Clark, President of NUS, had a classical
education with a difference. He attended a Public School,
and then went on to Cambridge University. In his first year
he became actively involved in the aftermath of the Garden
House demonstration, which led to the arrest of seven
students in February 1970. In his second year, he was
elected to the Executive of the Cambridge Students Union -
the first Executive body at this University. In his third
year he was elected as President of the CSU and was
granted a sabbatical year.
The following is an extract of a conversation he had with
F E L I X just before the beginning of the new term.
FELIX: What are your own political opinions?
Charles Clark: I a m a member of the Labour Party. I describe
myself a s being on the Left-wing of the party; I think that the
main economic problems that the country faces w i l l not be s o l v e d
by cutting public expenditure, wage control, and other methods
that this government is employing.
FELIX: What measures do you think are necessary?
Charles Clark: Measures that w i l l decrease unemployment; first,
that people have the spending power in their pockets to buy
products and thus stimulate production, and secondly a n increase
in public expenditure. S o far a s inflation i s concerned, I would
argue for much stricter price controls, enforceable by statute.
This may reduce profitability in certain areas, a n d no doubt
certain people w h o own capital may decide t o transfer it to
more profitable areas. South A f r i c a , for example, and areas of the
wor Id where the Labour Movement is not a t a 11 s t r o n g . Measures
banning export of c a p i t a l are, therefore, equally requisite.
FELIX: Would you confiscate this capital?
Charles Clark: Indeed, y e s .
FELIX: D o you accept that the "economic crisis" is with us?
Charles Clark: I certainly accept that.
F E U X : But in "NUS is Your Union" you say that students are
not responsible for the crisis?
Charles Clark: I don't think that students have created i t , nor
workers.
FELIX: But, surely, it does not matter who created it, it is here
to stay?
Charles Clark: It does matter. If you look for means of dealing
with the c r i s i s , you have equally t o look at how the c r i s i s came
about. Now, I think that the reason that the economic c r i s i s came
to e x i s t , e s p e c i a l l y in this country, was through lack of invest-
ment. The people w h o control the c a p i t a l decided that they would
not invest in this country. They took their investments elsewhere,
to more profitable areas, and for that they must bear a substantial
portion of the blame. We cannot and could not control those
d e c i s i o n s . , , „
FELIX: Are you in favour of total pulic ownership?
Charles Clark: N o ; we should take into public ownership, and
thus into public control, the key industries — those w h i c h control
our society .
FELIX: It often appears that some public Corportions are
inefficient monoliths that char up vast sums of money?
Charles Clark: That is patently false; there are two s p e c i f i c
factors which must be taken into a c c o u n t . T h e first is that the
public corporations have been saddled w i t h a massive debt
repayment — almost the sole cause of debt balances in many
cases —and s e c o n d , those industries which have been nationalised
are P u b l i c Service industries, and a s s u c h , public service has
come before the economic need of making a profit.
FELIX: How much money does NUS spend on its international
campaigns?
Charles Clark: 1 5%, of N U S resources - about £4,500. T h i s is
spent on the four areas on w h i c h we have p o l i c i e s ; South A f r i c a ,
Vietnam, C h i l e , and F a s c i s m in southern Europe (Greece and
formerly, Portugal.) T h e policy is now partly out of date, but I
think that the majority of students would support i t .
FELIX: How and why are these policies formulated?
Charles Clark: T h e NUS takes up certain policies because they
are prioritized by Student Unions w i s h i n g t o see certain questions
debated openly.
FELIX: Aren't fhese issues remote trom students?
Charles Clark: N o , they a r e n ' t . I think that B r i t i s h people, and
the B r i t i s h s o c i a l system, because Britain w a s once a world
empire, are s p e c i f i c a l l y involved in these a r e a s .
FELIX: Does the Broad Left impose a " p a r r y line" on its
supporters?
Charles Clark: We are not a p o l i t i c a l party, a n d w e cannot,
therefore, impose a line on members. It is not a " d e m o c r a t i c
c e n t r a l i s t " organisation in that s e n s e . Hopefully, w e a l l come t o
a concencus on matters.
FELIX: Many people at NUS Conference have observed that NUS
Exec members refuse to answer questions on which there is no
party line?
Charles Clark: S o far a s I know every E x e c u t i v e member when
asked a question, has answered it frankly.
FELIX: What does NUS think about the increase in tees for
overseas students?
Charles Clark: Very bad indeed, a s we s a i d to the Government
immediately. We are not w e l l enough involved in the whole
question of overseas students, and this makes things difficult.
Trevor P h i l l i p s has been doing an excellent job in this f i e l d , but
the movement must be developed s o that pressure of that kind
from the government c a n be r e s i s t e d .
My view of the way that the government should treat overseas
students is t h i s : that it should be prepared to accept overseas
students to c o l l e g e s in this country at a l l levels, and should
negotiate w i t h each foreign country an understanding a s to the
basis for exchanging students.
Student Unions in foreign countries take precisely the same
attitude a s we do towards overseas students; West Germany and
France are c a s e s i n point.
FELIX: What changes would you like to see in the present grants
system?
Charles Clark: I would like to s e e full grants for a l l students
over the age of s i x t e e n .
FELIX: What is the NUS case against "loan — grants"?
Charles Clark: F i r s t l y , it would discriminate against those from
poorer backgrounds; secondly, when y o u are working after your
education, y o u are mortgaged to a degree; thirdly, it would
discriminate against women. T h e most important argument, how-
ever, is that education should be a right for a l l people; we
would tike t o encourage everyone to go into further education,
and obviously less people are going to take it up if they w i l l be
financially discriminated against.
F E U X : What are the new tactics in this years grants campaign?
Charles Clark: I don't think that there is a n y virtue in novelty.
The main strategy is t o work with the trade unions and wider
public w h o are fighting the cuts in public expenditure.
FELIX: Why does the NUS favour comprehensive education?
Charles Clark: B e c a u s e the graded system of education perpetrates
educational privilage t o the disadvantage of m a n y . F o r instance,
the binary system of higher education s e t up a c l a s s system —
universities versus the rest, w h i c h means, b a s i c a l l y , that the
U n i v e r s i t i e s w i l l get a better deal than the rest.
F E U X : D o e s the NUS think that students should attend their
local Universities as a method of solving the accommodation
problem?
Charles Clark: N o . The higher education system is and should be
a national o n e .
The N U S seeks t o defend and represent students" interests
nationally and locally.Sometimes it f a i l s , sometimes it succeeds,
but student involvement, firstly in local unions, and secondly
in N U S is the only way that we can ensure (a) that we represent
our members adequately and (b) not just represent them on paper,
but a c t u a l l y campaign for the fulfillment of their v i e w s . I hope
Students at Imperial C o l l e g e w i l l d o t h i s .
FELIX: What role do you see the student press having to play
in student aflairs?
Charles Clark: T h e student press has an important role to play -
it must transmit t o the individual student H O N E S T L Y what the
views of h i s Union a r e , what the policies of N U S a r e . and what
the major debates w i t h i n it a r e . Unfortunately, there has been a
tendancy for some student newspapers t o t r i v i a l i s e these matters,
and for the papers to become the extensions of the editor's e g o .
FELIX: Charles C lark, thank you for talking to us.
Charles Clark: My pleasure.
