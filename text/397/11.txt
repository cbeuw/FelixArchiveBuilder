SPANISH CA VING
by John Miller
The caving club is again very active. T h i s summer
it mounted its first expedition for three years,visiting
a remote area high up in the western end of the
Cantabrian Mountains in north Spain.
The expedition was in the field for six weeks,
during which we discovered and surveyed three
kilometers of cave passage. We had to go up to 1000 m
above sea level to find our most exciting discovery.
Cueva De Wueva, as we later christened it, even had
its' own human skull at the bottom of a 39m entrance
pitch .'Not a sign of human habitation we thought, but
perhaps someone murdered in the Spanish C i v i l War,
as we had already found in the entrance of another
cave an old machine gun. We eventually discovered two
kilometers of passage in this cave, some of it
30m high, our exploration through was ended by a
sump, where the water reached the roof .
If you want to find out more about caving and the
excitement we shared this summer you should join us
on one of our weekend meets. Our next meet is the
weekend of October 17th - 19th-and is in Derbyshire.
Our notice baord is just inside the entrance to the
Union if you wish to sign up and come along.'
For the first time in a number
of years the Table Tennis C l u b
Is competing in a league . The
initial matches began in the
first week of term, and the
teams met with mixed fortune.
Lack of practise w a s evident
in the performances of both
teams, however with many
keen new members it is hoped
that competition for a place in
the team w i l l improve the
standard.
The Second team lost
heavily to N C B IV 7 - 2 with
both Steve and Paul winning
one game . The F i r s t ' s avenged
this defeat somewhat, with a
hard fought 5—4 w i n against
N C B III though this w a s due
mainly to K . winning a l l three
of h i s games.
This year the club has
many new members and more
would be welcome. T h e c l u b
room is on the third floor of the
Union at the E a s t end and is
open at a l l times. The club
runs a ' l a d d e r ' and Knockout
tournaments and it is hoped
that many friendly matches
against other colleges w i l l be
arranged. I Will be in the c l u b
room most Wednesday afternoons,
so come a long and j o i n .

London Transport's hopeless inefficiency caused a slight
hiccup at the start of our new s e a s o n , we missed the train.
R a l l y i n g our s p i r i t s , and hoping the race would not start without
us, we caught the next scheduled train, which incidentally
stops at more stations than the tube to Ongar.
T o the race. It was the
first U L trial, Including a mob
match with Blackheath Harriers
at Hayes In K e n t . The course
was a telling one, including a
" d e v a s t a t i o n h i l l " of over a
mile in length and 500 feet
h i g h . One d i d not exactly see
exhausted runners strewn
along the w a y s i d e , but it was
enough to show that a little
more training might be in
order before out next match.
The lack of immunity to
nettle beds only s l i g h t l y
spoilt what w a s a very enjoy-
able course. R o b A l l i n s o n
led U L home to finish fifth in
29mins 5 3 s e c s , third for U L
was Ian E l l i s in fourteenth
position. Andy Davey ran a
good race to finish four
minutes ahead of Mike Welford
gaining himself the chance to
buy V* of a jug. Dave J o n e s , r e -
covering from i l l n e s s , ran a
fine race finishing a good 2'/2
minutes up on John Shearer.
U L again managed to lose
to Blackheath by 461 to 612
points which was not surprising
considering they had only 2
runners in the first 13 places .
The post-race search for
real ale ended in failure s o the
team dispersed ending a n
enjoyable nrst tixture.
The club notice board is in
the Union by the cloakroom, if
anyone is Interested in running
for u s , each race w i l l be
advertised there.

The s e a s o n ' s exertions began on Saturday, bringing varied
results for the three teams involved .Due to Wednesday^ inclement
weather the trials were c a n c e l l e d , s o the strength of the teams
was uncertain.
The Ist XI played Richmond It's who gava the c o l l e g e a stiff
start to the s e a s o n , defeating them 2—1 . T h e team played quite
w e l l considering that this w a s their first game as a team and
that four members had never played on a grass pitch before. A n
early goal by Richmond, before
the defence had settled down
was equalised by a fine
individual effort from Trevor
(Superstar) Tutu just before
half time. IC started the second
half w e l l , when J i m Latter hit
the post with a good shot,
however our unfit side were
soon gasping and Richmond
scored the winning goal in the
last ten minutes. Despite the
defeat this performance w a s
encouraging for the rest of the
s e a s o n .
Team:- C Brown, J Cook, J
Marshall, M Lawless, I Hodges,
R Orlcan, J Latter, Afridi, T
Tutu, Fatanla, S Lee.
A n experimental 2nd team
faced strong opposition at
Osterley to lose 8 — 2 . In the
fisrt half a single goal by B o b
Middleton challenged the home
teams three goal lead but then
lack of fitness began to take
its toll . IC conceded five more
goals In the second half before
R Middleton scorco ills and the
Colleges second goal; a fine
individua I effort.
Team:- R Hutson, Callun, Vaz,
K Holden, Magney, D Balder-
stone, Isles, N Bell, D
Middleton, Gold ing .
The 3rd team showed great
promise with a fine 3—0 w i n
ovor Mertcn. Bruno speed
scored a l l three goals and
thereby qualified himself to
buy a j u g .
Team:- Mackay, D Carlisle,
Barett, Tan, Charlton, P
Newell, C Parker (Capt), B
Speed. Parmar, Stanton N
Harrison.
