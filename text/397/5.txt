P e t e r P a t t e r
Welcome to another Peter Patter, I
hope that you have a l l settled down to the
term, and involved yourselves In the
s o c i a l scene, a s w e l l as the work that
your Department w i l l have been giving
y o u . A sufficient variety of events to
cater for most tastes, seems to have been
provided this past week .
The week has been somewhat marred
by the mysterious illness that J o h n Downs
contracted, and is now believed to be
German Measles . I am sure that you would'
want to join me in wishing John a speedy
return to h e a l t h . The Union Office does .
not seem half as bright without him.
Refectories formed the major part of
the business at the first U G M of the
term as w a s reported in last w e e k ' s
F E L I X .There have been several develop-
ments since then. A t the Refectory
Committee meeting that afternoon it was
decided that Dr Levy, Mr Mooney, and I
have to obtain quotes from a number of
firms for a variety of different types of
by Peter Teague, ICU President
Inquiries Into the Refectories. Mr Mooney
and. I a l s o have to get together and review
the Formal Dinner Price L i s t , a s it
appears that this may be far from correct
f a functions organised by College a
Union C l u b s and Societies . This revision
should mean that the prices came down by
10%. May I publicly thank the other
Student Representatives on the Committee
who put their cases most eloquently.
Many students, particularly first
years, have a s k e d me how much the
College Calendar costs to produce, and
how much It Is used by the students w h o
each receive a c o p y . T h i s could perhaps
be one s m a l l area In which the C o l l e g e
could make savings In the years t o c o m e .
Any ideas that you have f a alternatives
w i l l be most w e l c o m e .
The threatened shortage of accommoda-
tion f a students seems to have evapaated-.
We ran the usual start of term ' C r a s h P a d '
in the Union Gym f a people with nowhere
to live and on the fullest night we only
had seven people staying there. I hope
this means that everyone e l s e has
found a satisfactory place to live. If you
are having problems with your L a n d l a d ,
or want to apply to have a fair rent fixed
f a your flat, then d e t a i l s , a d v i c e , and
application f a m s are available In the
Union Office. A good accommodation
advice service is needed within the
College, and John Downs and I have
been making a concerted e f f a t to collect
a l l the infamatlon that we c a n . We w i l l
be only too pleased to pass It on to
anyone w h o is Interested. Your local
C i t i z e n s A d v i c e Bureau should a l s o be
able to help with any accommodation
problems.
To close this Peter Patter I would just
like to remind you that the Nomination
Papers f a a whole host of Interesting
posts are up on the notice board In the
u n i o n Lower Lounge, s o why not pop over
and see If any of the jobs take your
fancy. See you at the next Union General
Meeting which Is on Thursday 21st
October, If not b e f a e . ;
