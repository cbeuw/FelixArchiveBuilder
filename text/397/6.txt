Last Saturday morning. In
bright s u n s h i n e , amid cheers
and shouting, IC's invasion of
Oxford Street, better known as
the Tlddy-Wlnks race, began.
The Miners, including the IF
contingent, arrived late (It
was their bar-night the previous
evening)to taunts of' you're late'
from the already present R C S
and G u i l d s .
The race was started by the
president of IC U n i o n , Peter
Teague, who was promptly
followed by the hordes of IC.
Meanwhile, intrepid mechanics
were attempting (rather
s u c c e s s f u l l y ) to bring Bo" and
Jez a l i v e for the e v e n t . During
these Initial stages, many
taxi and bus drivers worked
hard to contain their desire to
run down those "...bloody
students who are getting
madder every year".

lady received the boot (literally)
from an indignant c i t i z e n .

wrath of the law brought down
on him when he winked a c r o s s
