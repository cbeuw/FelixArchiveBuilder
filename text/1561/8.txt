here’s currently a student
skating offer on at the
Natural History Museum’s
ice rink. All day Mondays
and Tuesdays until
December 3, students can skate for
£8.50 with a free drink at the Café
Bar. If you present your student ID
when booking tickets at the box
office and then save your ticket, you
can show it at the Café Bar for a
drink of your choice.
I went to check out the offer on
Tuesday evening with some friends.
I’ve been skating at the NHM during
previous years but I never fail to
enjoy the ambience of skating there.
In my opinion this atmosphere
improves during the evening – the
twinkling lights in the trees around
the rink add something especially
wintry to the event.
The Natural History Museum’s
skates are the most uncomfortable
I’ve ever worn. They are the bane
of any skating session I participate
in there. Otherwise the skating is a
lot of fun! Your session starts on the
hour and lasts for 50 minutes so it’s
worth getting there 15 minutes early
to make sure you take maximum
advantage of the cheaper ticket. As
a warning, putting your bag in the
cloakroom costs £2 so you might
want to take a big bag that you can
put everyone’s stuff in, or just not
bring a bag with you at all!
Once you’re out on the ice you are
greeted with a great Christmas tree
in the centre of the rink, forming a
circuit. It can be very busy during
certain sessions (the disadvantage
with going in the evening) but
almost all skaters regardless of
ability seem to enjoy themselves. It’s
very informal and there are as many
people skating around by themselves
as there are those hand-in-hand
chatting away. I think only incredible
skaters wouldn’t have as enjoyable a
time.
After the session you head back
inside, hand in your skates and look
forward to your free drink! (I guess
you could get your drink beforehand
but I’m not sure skating on a glass of
wine is the best idea.) There’s also a
small on-site Mountain Warehouse
shop and if the NHM’s official skating
photographer snapped a photograph
of you and your mates you can buy
your photos here (prices for photos
start at £8).
If you’re looking to definitely get
your free drink without any hassle or
stress involved, I advise avoiding the
8pm session that I attended. Even if
you have a full day pick the 6pm or
7pm session. I was told that drinks
vouchers could be redeemed up
until half past 9, but when I arrived
there was a sign on the box office
saying your free drink could only
be claimed until 9pm. They are very
particular about this and will stop
serving very abruptly as soon as the
clock strikes 9, regardless of the state
of your order.
I got my free drink by leaving the
ice a little early. The drinks available
are beer, house white or red wine,
and cold drinks or hot drinks that
include hot chocolate and various
coffees and teas. You might want to
pick up a menu so you don’t have
to make an ad-hoc decision about
what to drink. The Café Bar has
a real skiing resort feel to it, with
long benches and large vintage
trunks serving as tables in some
spots. There’s also an area with sofas
around a big (obviously false) open
fire. The food is pretty pricey so I
wouldn’t bother grabbing a snack!
The student offer is only on until
December 3, so if it takes your
fancy, don’t delay and go next
week!
I
t’s less than two weeks until
the RCSU Science Challenge

will of course be free food and drink
