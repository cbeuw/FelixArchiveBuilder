The recent summit
highlighted the
Commonwealth’s
dangerous
trajectory. It will
be a rough road
if it continues this
way.
The Role & Responsibility of Comment
C
omment sections across
a broad variety of
newspapers all share a
common thread. The bulk
of their published material
will prove emotive for a sizeable
portion of its readership. Individuals
may empathise with views expressed
in a given article. Others may be
offended. On occasion a given issue
may catalyse universal approval or (as
one has come to appreciate in the past
seven days) disavowal of its material.
In context of a parochial University
community consisting of a spectrum
of nationalities, ideals and beliefs
(such as Imperial College London) the
margins for error are slight. In light
of this I wish to briefly examine the
boundaries for the Comment section.
The balance of facility and
mediation of opinion is the central
dilemma for the Comment section.
As was declared in the freshers’
issue in early October 2013 it is in
place to provide an extra medium of
communication for the student body.
This commitment inevitably lies in
the category of facility. If a student
submits an article they do so in good
faith. This should be honoured (where
appropriate) during the process of
editing and redaction.
The majority of contributors submit
a piece of writing on the basis of
elemental and core convictions,
heartfelt emotion or in light of
personal experience. Recent pieces
similar to those centred on the
Interfaith Movement, access for the
disabled or the changing dynamic of
Kenya typify the core aspiration of the
Comment section to voice rightfully
emotive issues.
Worldly reality means that many of
these emotive issues originate from
inequality, illness, conflict and even
death. This changes the atmosphere of
the Comment section with immediate
effect. The focus of obligation for
an editor should switch from the
facilitation of informative opinion to
its mediation. This choice is made in
an effort to engender peaceful and
affirmative discussion and debate.
The mediation does not lie solely in
the physical editing of an individual
article. Mediation can be utilised
by balancing a given article with a
counter-article. This can prove to
be insightful and constructive. My
head-to-head with Rory Fenton on
integrated education in the North of
Ireland helped me to view the issue
from a more objective perspective. In
spite of this, the approach can backfire.
Our readership will have realised this
over the past week. Some topics are
A
s the controversial
23rd Commonwealth
Governmental meeting
in Colombo closed
earlier this week there
was widespread feeling that the
Commonwealth has suffered a huge
dent in its credibility. In March 2013
(for the first time in its history) the
Commonwealth set out a new charter
emphasising the need for human
rights, freedom of expression, good
governance and the rule of law. Sri
Lanka (Commonwealth chair for the
next two years) frequently ignores
these tenets.
Last weekend descended into
a public relations disaster of
unprecedented proportions for both
Sri Lanka, and the Commonwealth.
Controversy over Sri Lanka’s
appalling human rights record
overshadowed the summit. The
meeting in Colombo (15th to 17th
November) had the lowest attendance
of State heads for years. Boycotts
from Canada and Mauritius on
the grounds of human rights and
an Indian snub dominated the
events preceding the meeting as the
incumbent Government tried to
rebrand Sri Lanka’s image and deflect
attention from its actions against the
Tamil population – it failed miserably.
John Baird, Canadian Foreign
Minister, noted on Commonwealth
inaction on Sri Lanka that:
“Canada did not get involved in the
Commonwealth to accommodate
evil; we came to combat it”. In a post-
colonial era, as the Commonwealth’s
relevance is increasingly debated, Sri
Lanka’s chairing of an organisation
that has rebranded itself to be a force
for good dooms the organisation. The

following Canada’s contribution
review. The most damning moment
came from the Mauritian President
Navin Ramgoolam. Warned by the
Commonwealth Secretary General,
Kamalesh Sharma, that it was
“convention” for the Head of State
of country to host the summit the
Mauritian leader did not renege on
his boycott. He withdrew Mauritius
hosting of CHOGM 2015.
It was the actions of David
Cameron that completely upstaged
the controversial summit. After the
conclusion of the opening ceremony
Cameron departed on a historic trip
to the capital of the Tamil homeland,
Jaffna. He became the first world
leader to visit the war-affected city
since the end of colonialism in 1948.
To quote the PM what he viewed “will
stay with [him]”. He visited the printing
office of the popular Tamil newspaper
(critical of Government), whilst
uploading pictures of bullet holes in
the walls of the office and the burnt
out shell of a printer to Twitter. The
office has been attacked repeatedly
in recent years: 48 journalists have
been killed in Sri Lanka within the last
decade and it is ranked in the bottom
20 for press freedom. Most were
Tamil. Many more have fled abroad or
silenced their criticism. The chilling
picture showcased the lack of freedom
of expression in Sri Lanka, one of the
“core values of the Commonwealth” as
the Secretary General put it. It set the
scene for the most sobering moment
of the entire summit: as David
Cameron’s motorcade passed through
the now militarily occupied city, scores
of mothers clashed with riot police,
seeking to bring attention to their
plight. Over 140,000 Tamils remain
unaccounted for in the Northern
Province. Many of these mothers
have sons who have disappeared since
surrendering to the Sri Lankan army
at the end of 2009. A 35-year old
Tamil activist named Sivakumaran
Baskaran has been reported missing
since the end of the 2013 summit.
Sri Lanka has the highest proportion
of ‘disappeared people’ on earth with
5676 cases registered at the UN alone.
Pictures of Sri Lankan police pushing
elderly women to the ground during a
Commonwealth summit will endure.
Some pleaded to foreign media tailing
the convoy to help them find their
missing loved ones while handing over
pictures. Channel 4 received over 130
such photos in just one hour.
Recent developments serve as
a form of resistance to oppressive
regimes. This has happened before.
In the 1970s the Commonwealth led
the boycott of South Africa’s apartheid
regime. It was in this movement that
the Commonwealth showed potential
to protect and uphold human rights
aroundtheworld.TheCommonwealth
had found its soul. One wonders
whether the organisation will keep
Sri Lanka at the helm. With the
UN Human Rights Commissioner
Navi Pillay (and David Cameron)
setting a March 2014 deadline for
the Sri Lankan regime to conduct
an independent investigation into
the litany of war crimes committed
at the end of the 2009 war and the
Sri Lankan government remaining
unwilling to do so, the stage is set for
a third resolution to the UN Human
Rights Council against Sri Lanka. The
fact that the chair of an organisation
emphasising human rights as one of
its core values could be the target of
a UN resolution will be disastrous for
the Commonwealth. This is precisely
why Cameron must call for Sri Lanka
to be suspend and their chairmanship
revoked.
The Secretary General of the
Commonwealth has continually
shielded Sri Lanka from criticism for
skewed towards one plaintive truth,
at least in the eyes of the majority of
the socio-political body. The editor,
in such instances, should follow his
or her ethical code and decide on an
article’s suitability or offensiveness.
On this basis it may be appropriate to
reject or retract an article.
The past week has forced me to
appreciate that while Felix Comment
is part of a student newspaper (which,
by definition, should be optimistic
and uplifting) due credence should
be given to the screening process of
input material from the student body.
The section editors will endeavour to
maintain the high standards of the
newspaper in future issues. We’ll take
criticism where it’s due.
Commonwealth: Beginning of the End?

reasons unknown. Kamalesh Sharma
has lost the faith of many, with the
Canadian Foreign Minister labelling
him a “stooge” of the Sri Lankan
government. His withdrawal of a
report from other Commonwealth
ministers (proving Sri Lanka’s
impeachment of their Chief
Justice to be unconstitutional) sent
shockwaves of outrage around the
world. The recent summit highlighted
the Commonwealth’s dangerous
trajectory. It will be a rough road if it
continues this way – one from which
it might not emerge at all.
In my opinion the Sri Lankan
President Mahinda Rajapakse and
Kamalesh Sharma were the men who
killed the Commonwealth.
