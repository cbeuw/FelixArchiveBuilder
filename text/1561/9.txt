FRIDAY 22 NOV
BUSINESS
Marco Nardone sets up a social networking platform for students
old has become CEO & founder of
the UK’s biggest student-only social
networking platform, Unii.com.
The journey to becoming a social
networking entrepreneur has
been exciting, nerve-wracking and
demanding – all rolled into one! The
first time I aired my opinions about
my plans for a new social platform to
close friends and family, admittedly
I was met with a few nervous
smiles and pats on the shoulder.
“Do you really think you can
compete with Facebook at your age?”
a few of my more blunt mates laughed.
But that’s not what I had in mind.
The platform I created – Unii.com
– wasn’t born to compete directly
with the big players like Facebook or
Twitter, and neither was it designed to
take users away from them. Instead,
the platform offers students the chance
to meet like-minded friends on their
course, at their university or in their
accommodation – all before they leave
home in September. When arriving on
campus, students can then use Unii.
com for every part of their student life:
by either meeting and socialising with
friends within the university network;
joining and managing societies
through our unique platform; or
even finding a job placement
through the dedicated jobsboard.
With younger audiences already
dwindling on Facebook, it was evident
to me that there was a hunger for a
platform that clearly appreciated its
What happens at uni...stays at Unii.com
In 2011, Marco Nardone graduated
with a degree in Physics from Imperial
College. In just two years, the 25-year-
Marco Nardone
target market’s exact needs and kept
them at the core of any development.
For Unii.com, this niche market
was made possible by ensuring only
those with a university-accredited
email address can sign in – finally
putting an end to those snooping
parents flicking through your photos
or future employers digging around
past antics you’d rather forget about!
But before this social start-up
journey had even begun, it was vital
I spent a lot of time (and patience!)
figuring out the student market that
Unii.com targeted. This involved
understanding what students would
find useful, which features would be
desirable and the importance of a
closed social environment. Being a
recent student myself, it would have
been easy to just use my gut instinct to
craftsomethingIwouldlikepersonally.
But Unii.com is about catering for all
students across the entire UK, and I
knew to become a successful start-up,
I had to listen to the current market.
Holding research focus groups and
listening to user feedback in the early
stagesoflaunchhashelpedUnii.comto
grow rapidly, seeing a massive 100,000
students sign up in just six months.
We continue to listen to these users
and have just revolutionised the user
experience on the platform – a direct
action taken from our user feedback.
With the continued popularity of
Unii.com, some people do question
how I went from the world of science
to the realms of social media. But
having a Physics degree at Imperial
College provided me with skills that
have helped guide me through my
journey as an entrepreneur and CEO,
in some really unexpected ways.
The four years at university not only
taught me to think logically and be
thorough, but above all – never give
up! Physics was a degree that involves
perseverance, time, and of course,
lots of studying. Unii.com wouldn’t
be where it is today if either my team
or I had given up at the first hurdle
and it was these skills that helped
keep me grounded in the beginning.
For students out there considering
diving into the start-up world or
the social media industry, that
wise old saying “Never put off until
tomorrow what you can do today”
speaks volumes. It was this kind
of thinking that led to the success
of Unii.com – I saw a gap in the
market, yet I didn’t wait until I was
older or watch someone else swoop
in and create an alternative website.
The future of Unii.com is looking
bright, as we look to tip 200,000
users by 2014. I can understand why
there were some doubts – as a young
graduate entrepreneur, any industry
breakout is going to be tough – but
by understanding the gap in the
market for something fresh, and
researching the target market inside
out, it’s proven to be a success and
I encourage any Imperial College
student to follow in these footsteps.
