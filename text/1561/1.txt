Last week Felix reported on College
Campus Services’ decisions to
change the campus cleaning services
during a re-tendering of the cleaning
contract. It transpired that one of
the department’s decisions included
reducing the frequency of cleaning
in bedrooms and communal areas, at
one stage justifying this by explaining
this had enabled the potential more
frequent cleaning of other areas such
as Ethos and the Library Café.
However, many students in halls
have been upset by the way in
which the changes were handled, in
particular the mistakes make with
the accommodation licence. Even
though the decisions may have been
signed during Summer, because
Campus Services neglected to update
the contract, many students feel as
though they have signed up for a more
frequent cleaning service than they
currently receive.
After our article on Friday, residents
received a better explanation of the
situation from Campus Services
via email this Tuesday. The email is
replicated (as is) below:
“Dear Hall Residents,
This summer the College-wide
cleaning contract was re-tendered for
the first time in over seven years. As a
result, we now receive a more specific
and flexible service for the same cost.
In response to feedback from students,
Campus Services used this opportunity
tomakechangestothecleaning services
provided in halls of residence as well
as across other College facilities that
we operate for students and staff. These
changes were not made to cut costs and
we will always aim to provide a high
standard of cleaning to our residents.
The changes:
Bedrooms are cleaned once a month
and more thoroughly. Kitchens are
now cleaned three days per week,
including once on a Saturday. The bins
still continue to be emptied daily and
recycling bins are emptied according to
local council collection rotas (usually
3-4 times per week).
Following these changes we have
been consulting with Imperial College
Union on how else to improve hall
cleaning provisions. As a result we
are in the process of making cleaning
equipment readily available in every
hall and we encourage students
to make use of them as and when
required. Information posters in every
kitchen will inform students of their
location and will include details on
local arrangements for cleaning and
bin collection.
All of the changes are being monitored
and we will shortly be conducting a
review in co-operation with Imperial
College Union and halls committees to
ensure the current service is adequate.
Our priority is providing an effective
cleaning service and we will continue
to modify the service where this is not
the case.
There has been some concern over
the College Accommodation Licence
(2013-2014) which includes details of
the previous cleaning arrangements in
halls. Because of tight timescales, the
clause referring to these arrangements
was not amended, however this was
a genuine error. We apologise for not
contacting you earlier about these
changes.
The Accommodation Licence is rarely
changed ? and before there are any
changes in the future Campus Services
will work closely with the Vice-
Provost (Education), the Director of
Student Support and Imperial College
Union to establish the best approach
for consultation and to ensure any
changes are effectively communicated
to students....
”
While the Campus Services
department has admitted to making
an error while handling the cleaning
contract, for many students this last
message leaves so many questions
unanswered. There has still been no
mention of the legality of continuing
the current cleaning service, given
that the Accommodation License
that binds halls residents and College
states that rooms will be cleaned
weekly instead of monthly.
However, a positive note in this issue
has been that during consultation
