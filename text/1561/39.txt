“Thank you very much... Goodbye.”

n Thursday 16th
November 1989, a
sixteen-year-old took
guard in his first
innings for India and
faced one of the most feared bowling
attacks in the world. He was dismissed
by fellow debutant Waqar Younis for
15, but everyone knew that there
was something special about this
schoolboy – the youngest ever test
cricketer at the time.
24 years later to the day, this ‘little ge-
nius’ gave a 25 minute farewell speech
to the crowd at his home ground in
Mumbai, talking about how “it is hard
to believe that this wonderful journey
has come to an end”. In light of crick-
eting legend Sachin Tendulkar’s re-
tirement Felix takes a look at his ten
best innings in an India shirt.
10. 114 v Australia
Perth 1992
Tendulkar, on his first tour of Aus-
tralia, was fast running out of part-
ners as India slumped to 159-8 in
Perth (known as one of the bounciest
pitches in the world). The Australian
bowling attack was looking forward to
exposing a major weakness in Sachin
Tendulkar’s game by bouncing him
out. But he responded in a way no-
body could have imagined. His in-
nings of 114 from 161 balls gave India
a fighting chance (which they ulti-
mately wasted), and gave the world a
clue of what might be to come.
9. 155 v Australia
Chennai 1998
This innings was one of the famous
battles that took place between Ten-
dulkar and Shane Warne over the
years. When Tendulkar arrived at the
crease, India were 47 runs behind and
two wickets down. Shane Warne was
in his element, bowling on a fourth
day Indian pitch with a lot of rough
on the leg side. Under pressure, Ten-
dulkar launched into one of the best
counter-attacking innings anyone has
ever played, frequently slog-sweeping
Warne into the stands. When India
declared later in the day, Tendulkar
was not out on 155 and had helped
India to a match winning lead of 347.
8. 146 v South Africa
Cape Town 2011
Tendulkar had already scored one
century in the series – his fiftieth –
but this was by far and away the more
important one. India were level at 1-1
and aiming for an improbable series
draw on the green and bouncy pitches
of South Africa. India were 28-2 in
response to South Africa’s 362 and
were in trouble – especially consid-
ering the low scores that both sides
had presented in the series thus far.
Against an impressive Dale Steyn and
Morne Morkel, Tendulkar racked up
146. Tendulkar then scored a patient
14 from 91 balls on day five to save
the test, the series and India’s status as
number one in the world. This would
turn out to be Tendulkar’s last test
century.
7. 119 v England
Old Trafford 1991
Chasing a near impossible 408 to win
the game, India slumped to 127-5, and
even saving the game looked unlikely.
A seventeen-year-old Tendulkar then
shocked everyone as he produced a
performance with great character,
scoring his first test century and sav-
ing the game for India – against all
odds.
6. 143 v Australia
Sharjah 1998
Australia’s target for India of 284 was
largely irrelevant in this game. The
more important figure was that of
250 (adjusted after a sandstorm mid-
game), which is what India needed to
book a place in the final on net run
rate (Australia had already qualified).
On a tough pitch – and Shane Warne
bowling – Tendulkar produced a mas-
ter class, scoring at more than a run a
ball to lead India to the final.
5. 241 v Australia
Sydney 2004
This innings could almost be thought
of as the resurrection of Tendulkar’s
career (although that might be a bit
over the top). Tendulkar had endured
a miserable 2003, scoring only 150
runs all season. The rumblings had
started – maybe Tendulkar was past
his prime? Tendulkar proved them
wrong in the New Year’s test in 2004,
scoring 241 not out as India racked
up 705. His next two innings were 61
not out in the second innings, and 194
not out in the first test against Paki-
stan. He wasn’t dismissed in 2004 until
April 5th. Tendulkar was back to his
scintillating best.
4. 98 v Pakistan
Centurion 2003
It may seem strange that one of Ten-
dulkar’s best innings isn’t a century
– especially given he has 100 of them
– but the reality is that even Tendulkar
thinks this was his best innings, peri-
od. There was a lot of hype surround-

terrorist attacks had just taken place
in Mumbai, and this match had
had to be hastily rearranged and
moved to Chennai from Mumbai.
Tendulkar, a Mumbai man, had ap-
peared in many advertisements in
the lead up to the match telling the
Indian people to stick together. On
the pitch, India had been behind the
8-ball for the first four days of the
match. But as usual Tendulkar came
to the rescue. Chasing 387 to win
(the third highest chase ever at the
time), Tendulkar reached his hun-
dred while hitting the winning runs.
The commentator’s words, “Make no
mistake about it, this is for Mumbai”
could not have been more apt.
1. 134 v Australia
Sharjah 1998
If his previous innings in Sharjah
was great (see 6), then this perfor-
mance that Tendulkar produced two
days later in the final could only be
classed as sensational. By this time
Tendulkar was clearly causing Shane
Warne nightmares (he also scored
a century against them in the ICC
Champions Trophy later in the year,
along with the ones in 9 and 6), as
he again swatted him away. Chasing
a target of 273 to win, Tendulkar led
India to victory scoring 134 from
131 balls.
ing the last group stage match – India
and Pakistan had not played each oth-
er in more than three years. Chasing
274, Tendulkar famously destroyed
Shoaib Akhtar in his first over, and
went on to score 98 in 75 balls, despite
suffering from cramp. Fireworks went
off in India after the match – not be-
cause India had qualified for the next
round, not because of the result, but
because Tendulkar had single-hand-
edly knocked arch-rivals Pakistan out
of the World Cup in the first round.
3. 200 v South Africa
Gwalior 2010
It was only fitting that the first person
to score 200 in One-Day-Internation-
als was the leading run scorer in the
form of the game. Already leading
1-0 in a three match series, Tendulkar
batted serenely through the entire 50
overs, scoring his 200th run in the last
over. India went on to take the series
2-1. To put it into context, Tendulkar
only batted one other time in the se-
ries, scoring 4. He was still named
man of the series.
2. 103 v England
Chennai 2008
When people remember this innings
they’ll also remember the circum-
stances that surrounded it. The 26/11
