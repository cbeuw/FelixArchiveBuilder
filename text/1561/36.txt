This week you decide to audition for
those star wars Disney auditions,
because you deserve the fame af-
ter years of anonymity at imperial.
You stand in line believing that that
main role is fated to be yours. One
in excitement, and you know your
time has come! It turns out that they
needed a jabba hut stand in, and
your body shape was perfect....well
at least you’re in a movie right?
This week, your swaggin
self can’t seem to stop say-
ing YOlO, swag right? Ev-
ery one starts avoiding you,
because they can’t deal with
your swag, YOlO! You YOlO
yourself up in your room and
swag yourself to death to
the sweet lullaby of the YOlO
song. YOlO?
This week you have to de-
cide between crapping out
your nose, or sneezing out
your ass. On the pro side,
both would be quite hilarious
party tricks. However one of
them would make every trip
to the toilet an absolute tor-
ture, and the other is sneez-
ing out your ass.
This week, after the brutal murder
of steven, you attempt a Franken-
stein style resurrection of your pet
mold. You get all different types of
-
gus from Evelyn gardens, a bac-
teria colony from Tizard Hall and a
bunch of ameoba from Beit. Every-
thing works out however instead of
your beloved steven you instead
get his homicidal brother, Evan.
This week, nothing happens to
you at all. You read right, noth-
ing! Nada, niente, rien, nichts.
why are you still reading? Don’t
you have anything better to
do? C’mon, get lost, I am busy
here......seriously, you are still
here? what are you expecting,
some kind of joke? Here’s one:
swam into the wall? Damn!
This week, you wake up as Bad
luck Brian. since you are inter-
net wise you know what awaits
you, so to avoid tempting fate
you lock yourself inside and stay
in bed. However it turns out that
that day, your lecturer awards a
his course as he is tired of mark-
ing exams. Oh also, you shit
your pants.
This week, the alignment of
Mars and Venus means that
you will be unlucky in love, but
lucky with your coursework.
However due to an asteroid
smashing into Uranus, you
may want to be careful about
someone eyeing you up in a
club, I mean you wouldn’t want
him to put anything where the
sun don’t shine. Right?
This week, after a drunken night
grafted a penis to your head. at
-
age quite amusing and you play
with it. However the novelty wears
off pretty quickly, and soon you get
tired of being called a dickhead.
You try to cut it off, but pass out
attached itself to your ass. Pint?
away, which no one ever uses mean-
ing it is in pristine condition. You start
taking shit, enjoying the clean that sur-
rounds you. However to your horror
you discover that there is no more toi-
let paper, meaning that you have been
pretty much imprisoned on your por-
celain throne. Three weeks later clean-
scratched into the wall.
ThisweektheEditorsneersatyouwhileyouopenanewFelixbundle,
despite standing next to a delivery bin full of several hundred fresh
copies. as you run away laughing, with Felicies being blown away
by the wind he takes out a calculator and carefully aims for your
head. He throws the calculator and hits your friend, who happens to
be an aquarius. while you tend to your friend’s mathematical injury,
the Editor picks up two bundles and runs towards you, mad with
hysteria! as you turn to run away he throws both bundles, while
screaming “This is FElIX”. However, tired after delivering the paper
this morning, his is tackled to the ground by a visiting school child.
You win this round!
This week you go to watch the
50th anniversary episode of Doc-
tor who at the cinema with sev-
eral of your friends. You arrive the
seated next to the lecturer your
accidentally swore at last week.
as you turn away embarrassed
he takes out a sonic screwdriver

These England fans are now well-pre-
pared for a summer of misery in Brazil.

Shit

uccessive friendly defeats
either side of last weekend
has led England manager
Roy Hodgson to state
that he feels England fans
are now thoroughly prepared for
the World Cup in Brazil next year.
The results also reassured fans still
confused by England’s successful
qualification campaign that the
national side was indeed still a bit shit.
Hodgson stated “Hopefully this
result will reduce the pain of failing to
qualify from a group that will probably
contain Switzerland as top seeds”
before adding “We’ve done this for the
fans, because it’s the hope that will kill
them”
People Apparently Surprised
F
ollowing the revelation
that former Co-op Bank
chairman, Paul Flowers may
well have bought cocaine
afterappearingbeforeaSelect
Committee, it has emerged that many
were somehow surprised by the news.
It seems almost shocking that
in this day and age people are
unaware that bankers and indeed
many in the City are regular
consumers of illegal substances.
How the fact that a member of one of
probably the biggest drug consuming
communitiesinLondonistakingdrugs
has surprised people is truly baffling.
Equally, the marvelling that has taken
place at the irony between Flower’s
role as a Methodist minister and his
blatanthedonismissimilarlyconfusing
to anyone who has more than five
minutes experience of the world
“How could he be so hypocrital?”
wondered one moron fascinated by
the contrast between Flowers’ public
and private personas and who clearly
has inexplicably never heard of one of
the most common of human failures
– failing to take your own advice.
At press time, The Turnip cannot
understand how the general
population appears to be so naive as to
actually think this story is particularly
newsworthy or worth much attention.
