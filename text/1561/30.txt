Stop Waffling. Eat it instead
Waffle Facts
This is not your average waffle shop.
Wafflemeister boasts a secret Belgian
recipe which dates back to the 1950s.
The freshly made waffles are topped
with a range of toppings, from Belgian
chocolate fudge and freshly whipped
cream to fresh fruit and natural gelato.
Wafflemeister is all about delivering a
high quality waffle – their promise is:
“It takes a lot of hard work, continuous
training and dedication to become
a Meister. The Wafflemeister takes
great pride in providing high quality,
fresh and great tasting products
which do not contain GM ingredients,
artificial flavourings, colourings or
preservatives.”
How is it different from
its competition?
1. Online delivery service to
be launched in December which will
offer same day delivery or next day
delivery UK wide.
2. 15% Discount to students at
Imperial College London.
3. Loyalty Programme: Bronze,
Silver and Gold. This gives you access
to a large range of deals and offers,
with increasing benefits as you go
from bronze to silver to gold.
The ‘meister’ in Wafflemesister,
founded by Alex Troullier, means in
German ‘a dedicated craftsman who
is passionate about his trade’. I spoke
with Alex to find out more:
Q: Tell me about yourself.
I was born in Switzerland and grew up
in Canada, Germany and Spain. I did
an MBA at Imperial and have business
experience setting up, for example, a
company that imported vitamins. I
then decided to go into the retail space
duringmyMBA,settinguptheBelgian
Food Company (BFC), for which I
opened 2 branches, one in Oxford
Street, the other in Baker Street. In
2000, just after I graduated, I got an
offer in finance, so I sold my shares
in BFC and went into Finance for ten
years. This involved working with
private equity, hedge funds and capital
raising. After a decade in finance, I
went back to the waffle space because
I missed waffles and for some reason it
had a soft spot with me. I bought back
BFC from the current owners who had
neglected it as they had also brought
a publishing company in Dubai. They
were very happy to sell the company
back to me and I set about revamping
and repositioning it within the market
space. Some of the factors which I
thought were important were to focus
on handmade, homemade waffles
using natural ingredients (organic
when possible), redesigning and
rebranding the business. I opened
branches in South Kensington and
Portobello road market and supply
Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge with
waffles.
Q: Why did you set up a waffle
business and what is your vision of
Wafflemeister for the future?
I have always been passionate about
goodtastingfood,whetheritissavoury
or dessert. When I set up the business,
apart for the conventional sandwich
bar and the occasional crepe shop, for
example ‘My Old Dutch’, there was not
much choice. Even to this day no one
really does great waffles apart from us
and there is no real brand ownership.
My vision is that we will own this
space; when people think of waffles
they think of Wafflemeister, whether
this is in retail where you walk into
the store, online where you get it
delivered or hopefully in the future,
supermarkets. We will also hope to sell
frozen waffle dough, where people can
purchase their own waffle iron so they
can bake waffles themselves and have
that fun experience. We have opened
up Wafflemeister branches in Abu
Dhabi and Kuala Lumpur’s Petronas
twin towers through franchises and
will expand to Dubai next February.
We hope to have opened ten stores
globally by the end of the year and 20
stores by the end of next year.
Q: Can you give me some insight
into your personal experience of the
MBA programme at Imperial?
This was a very positive experience for
me. One thing that stood out the most
to me was the case studies. I did an
executive MBA where I had a full time
job as well as committing to studies.
This flexibility meant I did not have to
put any of my goals on hold, and was
able to carry on with what I wanted
to do simultaneously. It was a great
experience to work under pressure as
part of a international team, to meet
deadlines which were set.
Q. What advice can you give to
students interested in enterprise?
It is important that students know
exactly what they want to achieve, how
to get there and have them written
down. Don’t make the list too long
as, just simple points, as the ‘to do’
list can get too long sometimes. The
hard work you put into achieving your
goals will pay off, be it finishing your
degree or starting your own business.
Now that winter has arrived, next
time when you are hungry, why not
pop by Wafflemeister for a warm
waffle?

Belgians make the batter with ale yeast, the Americans
quite often have theirs with fried chicken. The
Norwegians likes theirs with cheese and in Vietnam,
peanut butter, and they also have it in a
ball-shaped pattern!
