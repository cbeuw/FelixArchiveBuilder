Premier League
Predictions

Football Columnist
Man City v Tottenham
(Sunday 1:30pm, Sky Sports 1)
Both these teams recruited heavily in
attack over the summer but, whereas
Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero and
Alvaro Negredo are firing on all cyl-
inders, Roberto Soldado et al. are se-
riously struggling for goals. On top
of that, City are extremely strong at
home and it’s hard to see Spurs trou-
bling them. Andre Villas-Boas will
probably set up defensively and play
for a point as he has done in recent
matches, but can Spurs hold out for
90 minutes? I doubt it.
Prediction: 2-0
Everton v Liverpool
(Saturday 12:45pm, BT Sports 1)
This should be a cracking Mersey-
side derby. Both sides play attractive
football and have shown flair, hunger
and real quality all season. Everton are
unbeaten at Goodison Park this year,
but they come up against the Premier
League’s strongest attacking pair in
Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge. All
22 players on the pitch will be up for
this, so expect goals. If it was at An-
field I would give Liverpool the edge
but the Toffees are so strong at home
that I have to go for a draw.
Prediction: 2-2
West Ham v Chelsea
(Saturday 5:30pm, Sky Sports 1)
Chelsea went into the international
break on a bit of a downer, mustering
1 point from 6 against Newcastle and
West Brom, and even that was cour-
tesy of a highly contentious penalty
decision. West Ham also lost at Nor-
wich, but the big difference between
these sides is in attack. Mourinho can
call upon Fernando Torres, Demba
Ba, Samuel Eto’o and a wealth of mid-
fielders, whereas Big Sam has nobody.
He can use the small Upton Park pitch
to his advantage and restrict Chelsea’s
width, but the Blues will ultimately
have too much class.
Prediction: 1-2
Cardiff v Man Utd
(Sunday 4pm, Sky Sports 1)
Man City came away from Cardiff
empty-handed earlier in the season
and David Moyes’ men will be put
through their paces here. They simply
cannot afford to drop any more points
though and Rooney and van Persie
should see them over the line.
Prediction: 1-2
West Brom v Aston Villa
West Brom finally look the complete
footballing outfit, and Steve Clarke is
right to say they would be higher up
the table but for some poor referee-
ing decisions. Aston Villa’s best per-
formances come away from home but
with Christian Benteke off colour, the
Baggies can claim bragging rights in
the Midlands derby.
Prediction: 2-1
Best of the rest
Arsenal v Southampton
Who would have thought this would
be 1st versus 3rd place at the start of
the season? Both sides are doing bril-
liantly and Saints will be as hard as
ever to break down, but the Gunners
are very hard to oppose right now.
Prediction: 2-1
Fulham v Swansea
Swansea have made a slow start so it’s
just as well for Michael Laudrup that
Fulham are playing like amateurs at
the moment. Craven Cottage does not
suit the Swans’ expansive footballing
style but they are the better side and
should take at least a point back to
South Wales.
Prediction: 1-1
Hull v Crystal Palace
Crystal Palace’s best two recent dis-
plays have been at home to Arsenal
and Everton, but they scored in nei-
ther and goals are their biggest prob-
lem. Hull are by no means a free scor-
ing side but they know how to win
ugly at the KC Stadium.
Prediction: 2-0
Newcastle v Norwich
The biggest challenge for Chris
Hughton is to prove Norwich’s win
against West Ham wasn’t just a flash
in the pan. They need to build on that,
but their away record is abysmal and
Newcastle’s French midfield maestros
have the flair to hurt them.
Prediction: 2-0
Stoke v Sunderland
Stoke haven’t won since August but
Mark Hughes won’t face an easier
game all season. Sunderland have is-
sues all over the pitch and the Potters
should have enough to edge this one.
Only at rock-bottom Crystal Palace
have the Black Cats won away from
Wearside.
Prediction: 1-0
Water Polo:
Germany Tour
Diary
To kick off the season, the water
polo team returned for the fifth time
to Germany for the Aachen Annual
Water Polo Tournament. Not having
previously won any matches in
Germany, the team arrived with no
expectations other than giving it
their best shot and getting in a lot
of playing time to allow all levels
of players improve their skills.
The tournament kicked off on
the Saturday morning after a short
night of sleep in the corridor for
most people, with Maurice sleeping
on the bar top. The girls kicked off
with the first match. Starting out
modestly, they picked it up in the
second half with Jo scoring our first
goal of the day. Although the girls
played well, the other team was too
strong, leaving the girls at a 1-5 loss.
The girls’ second match was tougher,
with the other team playing violently
and the match resulted in a 1-7 loss
with another goal from Jo.
The guys started a bit slowly in
their first match but got better in
the second half with Tim getting two
goals in and our fresher Irish James
getting in another goal. We also had
Stuart put the ball in the corner of
the goal after a good pass by Tim.
The guys lost the match 4-10 but,
scoring more goals in this match than
we have in the whole tournament
in previous years, the guys were
pleased with their performance. The
second match of the day was tougher
for the guys but Alex scored in the
second half leaving the final score to
be 1-10.
Saturday night the team got ready
for the legendary water polo party.
Our team mascot The Blumenkholen
was broken early in the evening, but
this did not stop TJ from getting
photos with all the girls at the party.
Thanks to Tom BF Imperial were
the last to leave the party only three
hours before the first match on
Sunday morning. After some good
navigation and some solid driving
from Stu (mainly on the right side
of the road) the team arrived safely
at the pool. The guys’ match kicked
off at 9 am and impressively all the
guys got in the pool. The hangovers
and lack of sleep left the guys badly
defeated 9-0. Their second match
of the day was more successful with
Irish James scoring 3 goals, one
of them beautifully set up by an
interception, sprint and assist from
Jackson. Captain James took on the
strongest German player he could
find to protect the freshers and
still managed to get in a solid goal.
The match ended 4-6 with another
loss, but it was still one of the best
matches we have played, so everyone
was pleased.
The girls also had a match on the
last day and, with a motivational
talk from Joey, they all tried to
forget their pounding heads, giving
everything in the last match.
Starting off strong Jo managed
to get in a goal early in the match,
giving us an edge over the other
team. Smashing in another goal in
the second half, the excitement was
rising as the girls won their first ever
match in Germany 2-0!
Satisfied with the weekend and
their progression, the team is ready
to take on the other UK universities
knowing nothing will compare to the
German beasts.

I
f there is one thing that almost
seems certain, it is that England
face a much tougher task than
the one they undertook during
the summer. With the addition
of George Bailey (who showed strong
form in the recent one-day series in
India), Australia’s batting looks a bit
stronger. England’s bowling hasn’t
impressed as much as they would
have liked in the tour matches, and
the England management don’t seem
too sure which bowling combination
is their strongest.
However, England would have been
very strongly encouraged by their top-
order’s batting performance. Michael
Carberry has shown that he is the
ideal partner to Alistair Cook, which
would also allow Joe Root to remain
in the lower order where he has had
more success.
Mitchell Johnson has been added to
the bowling attack for Australia and
has been looking dangerous – espe-
cially during the one-day series against
India. James Faulkner, the Australian
all-rounder, will also be expected to
play in the test after showing his ex-
plosive credentials against India. In
the five games against India, Faulkner
scored 65 and 116 – both at strike
rates of higher than 150. However, de-
spite this, his bowling was below par,
and he will be looking to correct that
in this series. The key to Australia’s
challenge will be Michael Clarke and
Ryan Harris, both of whom are injury
prone. The Australian backroom staff
will have to work overtime to make
sure both last the series.
Writing the day before the Brisbane
test begins, it is clear that whilst Eng-
land will be tested more than they
were this summer, they should have
more than enough firepower to take
the series comfortably. Pessimists,
however, will point out that, whilst
England won 3-0, they were probably
saved in two tests by a combination
of rain and contentious decisions. If
those decisions had gone Australia’s
way, the series may have ended differ-
ently. They have to be wary of that this
time round.
