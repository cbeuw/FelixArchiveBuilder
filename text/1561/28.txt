I
have meant to write this article
for quite a while. This game was
released on the 3 of september
2013, almost two months ago.
I had pre-ordered it almost a
month earlier in my excitement. Let
me just explain to you, I LOVED the
Total War series. Beginning with
Medieval, all the way to Empire, I
had been a fan of this series. It just
epitomised everything that a strategy
game was supposed to be. Complex
enough to keep me playing for hours,
yet simple enough to pick it up and
understand everything within 5
minutes. These games were exactly
what I thought the perfect strategy
game should be. All in all, for those 4
games I must have poured roughly 800
hours into this game over 6 years. In
fact with the original Rome Total War
I managed to conquer the entire map
with three different factions. It was
pretty much the only game I played in
my school days.
Before we get to the actual review
of the game, let me just recap what
this game is about. Basically you are
dropped in ancient Europe and take
control of one of the multitude of
factions that were around at that time.
You can use diplomacy, economy
or outright warfare to dominate
your neighbours and ultimately the
entire world. On your way to world
domination you will be faced with
several objectives, choices and epic
battles. However what makes the total
war series unique is the mix between
turn based strategy on the campaign
map (you can see the entirety of
Europe) and the real time strategy on
the local battlefield. This gives you
the ability to playing the emperor,
controlling large swathes of the
ancient world, as well as the general
who has to motivate is tired and rain
drenched soldiers.
Now let us return from the ancient
ages and fast forward to the 3rd of
september of this year. After following
the dev blog for several months,
reading every piece of news I could
get my hands on, the day had come.
After having pre-loaded the game
onto my computer, I was stoked and
excited. I was ready to play. I fired
up the game and got right into the
tutorial. My first impression was
that, while everything seemed quite
similar to my old experiences there
were still many quite significant new
additions. Quickly my excitement
turned to horror as I realised how
much they had changed from my
Rome 2, Totally worth it?
beloved sequel. Gone were the family
trees that let you see all your faction
characters, gone was the option of
micromanaging a town, gone was the
ability to friggin pause your battle with
the space bar (trust me, for me that
was the absolute worst. I cannot tell
you the amount of times I have hit the
space bar expecting to stop time and
reorder my troops, and just see them
obliviously marching to their doom).
In fact, a lot had gone that I had loved
about the Total war series. Instead,
on my first impression, I saw a game
that was trying to be what I enjoyed
but couldn’t decide between being
to difficult or to easy, too bloated or
thin on material. In fact, after I had
completed the tutorial and played
some token rounds of the normal
campaign. I stopped and didn’t play
the game again for a month.
Thiswastheultimatedisappointment
for me. One of the cons that stick with
me from those first impressions was
the ridiculous amount of factions.
This made starting out a diplomatic
minefield (oh how I missed being
surrounded by rebels which I could
attack without any moral qualms), it
also made the end of turn wait almost
unbearable further into the game. If
you turned on the option to see the
AI moves, then you would literally
wait ten minutes and just see horses
moving back and forth. By the time
your move came back again, you had
forgotten everything you wanted to
do. Another were several actions that
creators of the game seemed to expect
you would take for granted. I mean I
couldn’t for my life understand why
I couldn’t garrison my town. It took
me several frustrated turns to figure
out that the buildings in that town
provided it with soldiers. My biggest
complaint though is the slowness of
the game. I remember being able to
take of large swathes of Europe on
the easy setting within the first couple
moves in the first Rome. However
here even in Rome 2, it takes me 10
moves to take over italy alone. It just
makes everything seem to drag along.
Therefore my lack of incentive to pick
this game up again.
However my guilty conscious
would not let me go. I loved this
series, I payed money for this game.
I was going to give it another chance.
Another chance I did give it. And
on second viewing I did find some
positives. Without my over hyped
expectations I could appreciate things
that my bitter eyes had overseen in my
first sitting. The update in graphics
is absolutely great and some of the
additions are not that bad! I mean the
naval battles recapture some of that
epicness I felt when I first played the
Total war games. Also the new battle
mechanics make the battles so much
more immersive and realistic! In fact
the second session was significantly
longer than the first failed one, and
there will be many more.
All in all I think this game is quite an
achievement, apart from some cons
which are being cleaned up in each
successive update, and was worth the
£30 pounds I spent. However I guess
I made the mistake of playing it like it
was the first Rome, which it wasn’t. It
is its own game, and cannot be seen
as a twin (albeit higher graphics) than
its predecessor. So if you are someone
who is happy with their old Total war
games, and sees absolutely no reason
to change, in fact would abhor change,
avoid this game. It will just disappoint
you. However if you are looking for
a new approach to this classic series,
and don’t have too high expectations I
would suggest go for it!
Now I’m off to conquer the world
with....hmm...I’m feeling the Iceni
(brits) today!
Does this sequel to one of the best strategies games live up to the hype?
