The Fang-tom Menace
Latest adaptation of Dracula has yet to impress
It was easy to respond to the news of
NBC and Sky’s latest venture, Dracula,
with a roll of the eyes. What with the
frenzied spate of anything vampire-
themed following the dubious success
of Twilight, including the rise and fall
of True Blood and The Vampire Dia-
ries, it would appear that the show is
jumping on the bandwagon five years
too late.
On the other hand, when looking for
source material for a tale about vam-
pires, you’d be hard-pressed to find
anything better than Bram Stoker’s
original novel which was, after all, re-
sponsible for igniting the whole vam-
pire craze in the first place. The titular
character in the book, first published
in 1879, is a far cry from Edward Cul-
len, with no sparkles or teenage angst
in sight. In hindsight, it’s more sur-
prising that it took this long for a new
adaption to be made.
The show takes more than a few lib-
erties with the story, which isn’t in it-
self a problem: over the years, the sto-
ry has been adapted and reinterpreted
so many times that it’s difficult to do
it in an original way. Yet there’s a lot
to puzzle over from just the first epi-
sode. The pilot starts off with two ar-
chaeologists investing a crypt, where
they discover the ominously caged re-
mains of a skeleton in a sarcophagus.
In a twist that is shocking to approxi-
mately no one, one of the tomb raid-
ers turns out to be somewhat shady
and slices his partner’s throat over the
skeletal figure, thereby rejuvenating
the corpse. So far, pretty standard for
a vampire flick.
We’re then transported to London
and introduced to Alexander Grayson,
aka Dracula, posing as an American
businessman for reasons I couldn’t
quite figure out (this would be less of
an issue except actor Jonathan Rhys-
Meyers puts on a pretty atrocious
American accent). He’s throwing a
grand party in an attempt to impress
the British socialites, which he does
by unveiling his new invention: a ma-
chine that generates wireless power
drawn from… the Earth’s magnetic
field, apparently? This is about all the
explanation we receive, apart from
Dracula boasting how Edison and
Tesla couldn’t manage it, and a lot
of steam-powered machinery in the
basement.
Suitably impressed with Dracula’s
new technology is Mina Murray, a
young medical student studying un-
der Van Helsing, who’s being escort-
ed by her beau, journalist Jonathan
Harker. She is immediately drawn to
Dracula, who likewise takes an inter-
est in her after flashbacks reveal she
looks identical to his long-dead wife.
The show makes some pretty big
departures from both the novel and
previous adaptations, not least of
which is the role of Van Helsing – tra-
ditionally Dracula’s nemesis – who is
revealed to be the person responsible
for reviving Dracula in the first place.
Also introduced are a few new char-
acters, such as Lady Jayne Wetherby, a
rich socialite who gets pretty intimate
with Dracula in a viewing box at the
opera, but who’s also handy with a
pair of knives.
Dracula has all the ingredients of a
decent vampire show, but so far seems
to be lacking in something. Dracula
himself doesn’t feel menacing enough,
with too much emphasis on his charm
and good looks (admittedly hand-
some though Jonathan Rhys-Meyers
is); it gives the impression that the
vampire is being portrayed as an anti-
hero, rather than the straight-up mon-
ster he’s supposed to be. NBC and Sky
Living, the channels jointly responsi-
ble for producing the show, were also
both home to the fantastic Hannibal
which premiered earlier in the year,
and perhaps would have done well to
take from there a few tips as to how
to reimagine a famous fictitious vil-
lain. Whilst ratings are dropping off
in America, Dracula seems to have
gotten off to a stronger start here in
the UK, and with a first series of ten
episodes, there’s plenty of time for the
show to pick up. Let’s hope Dracula
finds his bite in the near future.
