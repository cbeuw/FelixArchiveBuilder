What perfect nonsense!
New Jeeves & Wooster play is laugh out loud funny, says George Shillam
A
s proved by the BBC’s
recent TV adaptation of
Wodehouse’s Blandings
Castle books, which
any Wodehouse fan
would have found painful to watch,
it seems to be difficult to transfer
Wodehouse’s works to other forms of
media. As such, I went into the theatre
with mixed expectations. However,
the initial signs were promising; I
had high hopes when the preliminary
mobile phone announcement was
done using P.G. Wodehouse quotes.
My expectations were more than
met. Every conversation of this play
elicited laughs and the script never
lost sight of its source material. I
was particularly delighted to see that
Wodehouse’s description of Spode
had been included – “a big chap with
a small moustache and the sort of eye
that can open an oyster at sixty paces”.
Perfect Nonsense is an adaptation of
the novel The Code of the Woosters.
It’s one of the best known P.G.
Wodehouse books, partly due to its
television adaptation (the one with
the cow-creamer), and the play sticks
remarkably closely to the book except
in one way; here the premise is that
Bertie is putting on a play about his
recent weekend at Totleigh Towers,
where the original story takes place.
Essentially, it is a play withwin a play.
This twist works very well, and
provides ample opportunities for
more humour to be injected. He
enlists Jeeves and his Aunt Dahlia’s
butler Seppings as the two other
members of his cast, and the two
butlers, as well as playing themselves,
impersonate all the other characters
in the play. It gets sillier and sillier
(not least when Seppings tries to
play the formidable Roderick Spode),
culminating in Jeeves playing both
parties of a conversation, leaping
back and forth across the stage.
The one downside of this was that
some of the characters seemed flatter
than they could have – Spode, for
example, lost all sense of menace. On
the other hand, Stephen Mangan’s
performance as Bertie was the star
of the show. The way he interacted
with the audience (despite Jeeves’
disapproval) had the whole crowd
roaring with laughter, and the feeling

that Bertie was actually improvising
the whole thing was convincing.
Matthew Macfayden was also
impressive as Jeeves, managing to
remain superbly aloof throughout all
his gags. His other roles are equally
polished, from Stiffy Byng to Sir
Watkyn Basset.
One other minor quibble is that
not all of the humour reached such a
high standard. As well as the original
jokes from Wodehouse’s writing,
and the humour stemming from
Bertie’s endearing inexperience and
ineptness at acting, there are other
far clumsier gags. Butterfield, the
butler at Totleigh Towers, seems to
be in the play for the sole purpose of
thanking anyone who asks him to do
something. This is a joke that is, the
first time, only mildly funny. By the
end it had definitely started to grate.
Thankfully, however, these jokes
make up but a small proportion of the
play.
Overall the show lived up to its
name, but not always for quite the
right reasons. Casual Wodehouse
fans, or those who have only seen Fry
and Laurie’s TV show, will love this
farce for its imaginative silliness, but
more die-hard Wodehousians will
miss the cleverness and subtlety of
the master of comedy’s sublime wit.

The long awaited revival of Jez
Butterworth’s play Mojo opened on the
13th November, and saw Rupert Grint
making his professional theatre debut.
Premiering in the Royal Court Theatre
in 1995, Mojo was the recipient of the
1996 Laurence Olivier Award for Best
New Comedy, with a film adaptation
released in 1997.
Based in the rock ‘n’ roll Soho scene
of the 1950s, this black comedy is set
entirely within the seedy ‘Atlantic’
nightclub. Silver Johnny (Tom Rhys

Harries) – a young and talented
performer – has the potential to go
far. However his jealous manager, the
nightclub owner Ezra, tries to protect
him from the advances of another local
gangster, Sam Ross. After Ezra’s body
is found sawn in half and deposited in
separate dustbins, it is left to the rest
of the group to resolve the situation,
and the nightclub in which they
previously dreamed of success turns
into an isolated prison.
Featuring a phenomenal cast, it
is at first strange to watch the valet
from Downton (Brendan Coyle), Ron
Weasley (Rupert Grint), 007’s Q (Ben
Whishaw), Merlin (Colin Morgan)
and Made in Dagenham’s Daniel Mays
alongside one another as pill-popping,
wannabee big-shot gangsters, together
with newcomer Harries. The play is
non-apologetic for its all-male cast,
SIMON ANNAND
and deals with themes of masculinity
and the fight for supremacy.
Although it is hard to erase the
memory of Grint as Ron Weasley, his
performance as Sweets the nervous
sidekick is strong, with skilful comic
timing. There are several well-written
duologues between Grint and Mays
that had the audience laughing
out loud. Mays certainly conjures
the most comic effect with his
Chaplinesque persona and animated
actions. The language used is not for
the faint hearted, with the ‘C-bomb’
being dropped fairly regularly, and
certainly accounts for the parental
advisory that comes with the tickets.
Coyle commands great stage presence
as Mickey, however is occasionally let
down by his cockney accent, which
has a hint of Downton lingering at
times.
The Second Act is certainly more
powerful than the first; containing
a death scene more realistic than
any I have ever witnessed, movie
or otherwise. Tension significantly
climaxes towards the end and makes
up for the somewhat slow opening
of the play. The show was stolen
by Whishaw, who’s psychotic and
arrogant nature quickly turns light-
hearted conversation into something
more sinister. Recognition must also
be given to the staging and lighting
design:youarecompletelytransported
into this dingy Soho club along with
its muggy air and stale alcohol.
Overall this is a playful yet dark
performance that is powered by the
strength of its cast. What it lacks in
pace is made up for in the script and
certainly allows for an impressive and
entertaining evening out.
