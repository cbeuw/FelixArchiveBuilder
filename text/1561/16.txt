An original short story by Eoghan Totten
“As you go through life Shane, remem-
ber one thing. There’s a price to pay for
everything.”
The words of Aodhán Madine, my
father, once spoken flippantly, now
touch a raw nerve. Time has passed and
they’re like daggers, sharpened by the
whetstone of the crash.
We were happy back then. Through
the untarnished eyes of infancy my
family’s fortunes seemed promising.
Glimpses of things to come were bathed
in the deep tones of Dad’s voice, like
stars in the ether.
***
January ‘94 was my fifth birthday. I
remember it vividly. Dad had taken my
elder brother Joe and I out for a drive.
Perched beside him in his clapped out
Ford Transit we gazed out at the barren
building site. I’ll never forget his smile
as he pulled up by the curb. It was one
of unadulterated relief, stretching from
ear to ear.
“Your Dad’s building twenty houses
here. It’ll keep dinner on the table for
the next while”
, said Dad.
He put the van in gear and pulled
away while Joe and I fell back into child-
ish nonchalance, playing ‘I Spy’ as we
weaved through the labyrinth of Dublin
streets.
Back then the Madine household was
lively. We moved after Dad’s building
firm took off. ‘A. M. Construction’ was
gathering strength. He was never out of
that van. Joe and I would ask over the
breakfast table, “Where are you building
houses today, Da?” He’d reply, “Lucan,
boys” or, “Sandymount, lads”
. He had
signs up all over Dublin with embossed
letters that read: “A. M. Construction –
Getting the Job Done”
. Mammy used to
tell us that he was off to build a cage for
the Celtic Tiger.
I find it haunting that some of those
signs still hang in tatters, nineteen years
later.
***
We arrived home. Heaving me up
onto his shoulders, he ran up the drive-
way and through the open front door,
with Joe giving chase. The house was
peppered with boxes crammed with
our things, like parcelled promises of
life to come. We moved through to the
kitchen. A horde was gathered around
the table.
“There’s Sarah”
, said Dad, kissing my
mother on the cheek. Granda Michael
was there with outstretched arms to
receive Joe and I. Dan Harrington,
Dad’s business partner, looked on with
a smile, as did Mickey Bishop, his best
friend. His billowing black moustache
gleamed in the half-light. Joe and I were
mesmerised by my birthday cake with
its five flickering candles standing proud
and tall.
Later that evening, briefly stirring
from the joy of the celebrations, I ven-
tured back into the kitchen. The adults
were gathered around the table in ani-
mated conversation. I was hit by a num-
ber of sensations: the shadows danc-
ing across their faces; the veracity with
which they held one another’s gaze; and
most strikingly, the rumbling tone of
their voices.
“You’re onto something big, Aodhán”
,
said Mickey Bishop. My father began
to stare wistfully into space. “Jaysus, I
could pocket two-hundred thousand
punt”
, he whispered.
“You’ll have to sign the Lucan deal by
Monday and maybe the whole lot”
, said
Dan. Mammy joined in. “Sure the bank
said they’ll approve any loans you’ll
need.”
For a fleeting instant I caught Granda’s
eye. They were moist with tears as he
spoke. “Sign it Aodhán. Give your boys
the comforts I could never afford to give
you. The Madines deserve a break. It’s
our time.”
Mammy turned and saw me. She car-
ried me upstairs and had me ready for
bed in an instant.
I loved my room. My bed was in the
corner beneath a skylight embedded in
the ceiling. The stars glistened in the
deep blue azure of night. Sleep envel-
oped me. My eyes began to flicker as I
stared into this hypnotic tapestry. One
of my closing thoughts was of how the
stars, like majestic sentinels, watched
over all the children of Ireland… and I
thought of how the phosphorescence
of Granda’s tears looked just like those
stars. They appeared as one and the
same thing, curators of hope and of
dreams.
***
The years wore on. Each cycle of the
calendar saw the promise of the last
dwarfed by that of the next. Ireland’s
destiny became enmeshed with the
prosperity of the times, woven into a
single fabric that we hoped had no end.
Houses, roads and bridges flashed
into existence as the country was en-
veloped in an economic mirage. Dad’s
work went with this rushing tide. Dur-
ing those years the house was in an eter-
nal state of flux. Workmen came and
went, trailing a veil of dust in their wake
as rhythmically as day and night.
I’d rush home from school in the eve-
nings in anticipation of the surprises
and changes awaiting me. Initially they
were subtle, like fresh coats of paint on
the walls or a new vase for the dining
room. In time they became magnified
and exuberant, at least in the eyes of my
brother and I. One balmy spring even-
ing we rounded the corner of our Ave-
nue and stopped dead in our tracks. Dad
was waxing a new BMW. With its opu-
lent, black body and tapered exhaust it
rendered Joe aghast. It fuelled my im-
agination for many weeks. I christened
it ‘The Bat Mobile’ there and then. Dad
replied, “Good man”
, before grinning
and patting me on the head.
That evening my thoughts became
sinister. Gazing through my skylight the
night revealed itself. Dad had scolded
me for bursting into his office. He’d been
sitting nestled behind his desk with his
glasses perched on the bridge of his
nose. He scrutinised numbers of im-
pressive length inscribed in a thick ledg-
er. A sole desk lamp provided the only
light in the room. Squat piles of money
were neatly arranged on the table. He
laced the notes back and forth between
his fingers as though in a trance. He
whispered as he counted with his face
held taut in a concentrated grimace.
When he looked up his face went
limp. His expression was a rich complex
of surprise and hostility. Even as an eight
year old boy I could deduce a veneer of
embarrassment…even shame. It was
barely perceptible but it was there.
“Out now Shane”
, said Dad. His voice
cut through me like a knife through but-
ter. I turned to leave but hesitated, com-
pelled to be defiant.
Squarely holding his gaze I turned his
familiar phrase back on him, “There’s a
price to pay for everything, isn’t there?”
He hurdled the desk and raised his
hand before I could blink. It stopped
short. He became as still as a statue. The
colour drained from his cheeks as he
spoke. His voice was as cold and pierc-
ing as his stare: “I’ve never been able to
decide whether you’re incredibly bright
or incredibly stupid.”
His pallor returned on a reinvigor-
ated wave of rage. The crisp notes were
bunched between his fingers as he
yelled, “Out!” I burst into tears. He took
me in his arms. I remember him whis-
pering to me as he carried me from the
office, “I’m just tired. I didn’t mean it
Shane…did I?”
His animated voice later drifted up
the stairs. Mammy reproached him
for losing his cool. I heard the rustle
of leather as he settled in his chair. He
sighed and spoke. “Look at that money
on the table Sarah. It doesn’t look right,
like it shouldn’t be there. More and
more keeps coming in…but sure, eve-
rybody’s at it. I often question whether
that makes it right. Then I remember
how I’ve broken my back since 1988…
for you, for the boys. Shane was right.
Everything has its price.”
He fell quiet. Mammy broke the si-
lence, “Aodhán, he’s only a child...” Dad
cut in. “I hope he learns one thing. In
this day and age ask no questions. You
go forward or you fail.”
As I rolled over in bed I willed sleep
to come. You go forward or you fail. His
words seemed defamatory back then.
Jesus, if he knew what was coming…
***
Joe and I were always close. We loved
cars. Joe would idle away the weekends
staring vacantly at Dad’s BMW. With
his legs tucked under him he’d crawl
beneath its aggressive bulk, combing
every inch of its garrulous opulence.
Dad used to humour him and say, “She’s
worth every one of the thirty thousand
invested in her, Joe.”
Whenever he mentioned money I’d
lose interest, as though by linking the
car to reality its magic was dispersed.
At this juncture I’d jump on my bike
and cycle around town, often passing
through one of Dad’s building sites as
the lifeless shells of innumerable houses
merged and blurred. With my heart
booming I’d return and collapse on the
front lawn, taking pride in my exer-
tion. I never touched the brakes. One
afternoon Dad forced a helmet on me.
“There’s a price to pay for everything”
, he
said knowingly, staring me down.
High on the elixir of risk, I didn’t care.
In my head I was Michael Schumacher
and he never lost... just like Dad.
