SCIENCE
Many of us think that staying up late
at night gives us more time to be
productive; however, a recent study
at UC Berkeley has shown that ‘night
owls’ perform worse academically and
emotionally in the long run.
This study focused on 2,700 US
adolescents of whom 30% claimed
staying up later than 11:30pm on
school nights, and many of them
stayed up past 1:30am during holidays.
The data for this study were obtained
from the National Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent Health, where the
records tracked back to 1994. It was
found that GPA scores of the ‘night
owls’ were significantly lower than
their classmates who had earlier bed-
times. In addition, sleeping late during
summer holidays had an impact on
the emotional well-being of these
individuals.
So, why do so many teens stay up
late?Itappearsthatanumberoffactors

to socialise; thus these students
compromise their sleep to make time
to interact with their friends.
The circadian rhythm is any
biological process that involves the
‘human body clock’ and it is involved
in regulating physiological and
metabolic functions. The researchers
hypothesized that adolescents have
something called an ‘evening circadian
preference’, which gives them a desire
to work later at night.
In addition, another factor identified
which keeps teenagers up so late is the
increasing use of various electronic
gadgets at younger ages. Studies
indicate that bright lights from
laptop screens and smart-phones
lead to a reduction of melatonin, a
key hormone involved in sleep cycle
regulation.
Finally, the study also suggests that
poor parental monitoring could also
lead to teens staying up late.
This is not the first study to have
been published linking sleep with
performance, thus it only reinforces
that it is increasingly becoming a
common problem in young adults.
Regular sleep deprivation can have
a great impact on the health of an
individual; therefore this issue should
not be taken so lightly. Most of you
may think that this is irrelevant since
we have already passed our adolescent
stage.
But don’t forget that we ourselves
could become parents one day, and it
would be our responsibility to ensure
and motivate our children to follow a
regular early bed time to help them
perform better academically and
emotionally.
Synthetic alcohol does this

or those reading this
hungover in bed after that
“quick pint” on a Thursday
evening turned into a
free for all, we have good
news. It seems that our very own
Professor Nutt, previous government
advisor and keen advocate of drug
legalisation, has finally identified
candidate molecules that can imitate
all the good parts of drinking, without
that dreaded feeling the next day. The
molecule can hopefully reproduce
the pleasurable effects of alcohol, but,
with a lower toxicity, may keep the
hangovers and health risks associated
with drinking at bay.
Alcohol acts as a depressant on
the central nervous system, and a
multitudeofreceptors,includingthose
that respond to the neurotransmitter
GABA, can be modulated in activity
by ethanol. GABA acts as an inhibitory
molecule in vertebrates when binding
to transmembrane receptors on the
neurons of the brain, which in turn
effects the transmission of nerve
impulses and can result in feeling
more relaxed or unfazed.
Ethanol is rather cavalier in its
actions, however; it targets a lot
of other cellular receptors non-
specifically too, so has a large number
of routes in which it can modulate its
effects. Being able to pinpoint those
interactions that deliver the desirable
effects of ethanol consumption is key,
and it may be that GABA is the answer.
This alcohol substitute would target
GABA receptors very specifically to
ensure the positive effects alcohol
can have are sustained whilst the
undesirable side effects are reduced.
These include the immediate effects
such as loss of co-ordination,
aggression and memory loss, but also
the after effects, such as the hangover
you may indeed be suffering right now.
It seems too good to be true, right?
It seems that Professor Nutt is still
discussing his top secret synthetic
alcohol substitute use with investors,
but is worried that the drug may
be legislated too heavily by the
government. This is somewhat
of a touchy issue that has caused
controversy concerning Nutt in the
past, with his recent paper in Nature
this year urging the government
to weaken the current legislation
surrounding psychotics falling on deaf
ears.
Although the alteration of legislation
surrounding drugs such as MDMA
and marijuana is an understandably
more complex and controversial issue,
hopefully such complications will not
surround the possible legislation of
this new synthetic alcohol substitute
if the benefits discussed are a tangible
reality.
Therefore it seems we can only sit
and wait for the holy grail of student
satisfaction for now. Unfortunately,
for those that are still mulling over last
night’s antics whilst hiding away from
the world, this solution isn’t going to
be getting you to your 9am lectures in
time today. Right now, it just might be
better to get some toast and tea and
fight off that hangover the traditional
way.
