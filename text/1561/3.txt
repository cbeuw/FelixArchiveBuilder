On Tuesday afternoon the Union
sent an email to all officers of Union
clubs to which they attached the
“Alcohol Code of Conduct for Clubs,
Societies & Projects”. This email said
that while the Union recognises that
“social activities are an enjoyable
aspect of membership of many of
our Clubs, Societies & Projects… any
encouragement of the consumption of
excessive amounts of alcohol must not
occur.”
While the Union, as the licence
holder of the Beit Quadrangle and
as the organisation to which all clubs
belong, is justified in stating the rules
and expected standards that Union
clubs are expected to adhere to when
consuming alcohol, after reading the
contents of the recent email Felix
wonders if this most recent missive has
been written as a response to specific
incidents, specifically, whether any
sports clubs have been caught carrying
out initiations – especially in light of
the fact that the Code of Conduct had
already been sent to all officers earlier
in the term (original email dated Oct
2, 2013).
The email focuses on initiation
ceremonies and related issues,
particularly emphasising that:
“Any initiation ceremony or other
compulsory or effectively compulsory
degrading ritual, regardless of the
name or advertising of the event,
which affects the physical or mental
well-being of any individual, is not
permitted.”
We wonder whether this email is
reactionary and, if so, why is there
no clear example of an/the offending
Club, Society or Project being
disciplined – something the email
takes great care to detail.
We are also surprised that despite
saying “the Union has developed [the
code of conduct]” (bit.ly/17NQwPr),
we can find no record on the Union’s
websiteoftheUnionactuallyaccepting
the code at any formally convened
committee meeting (Trustee Board,
Union Council, Union Executive, etc).
However, an alternative explanation
might be derived from the fact that
BUCS’ (British Universities & Colleges
Sport) recently published Policy on
Initiations and Anti-Social Behaviour
(Oct. 2013), in which BUCS states
“From October 2013 all institutions
must provide BUCS with a link to
their code of conduct in relation to
initiations, and alcohol abuse in sport.
Members which do not comply will not
be permitted to remain members of
BUCS.

The Nanyang Technological
University’s (NTU) Renaissance
Engineering Programme (REP) picks
the top 50 engineering students that
are trained to be the “Engineering
Leaders of Tomorrow”. Last week,
Imperial signed a contract with NTU
agreeing to partake in this scheme.
TheREPstudentsstudy: engineering,
science, technology, business,
economics, and entrepreneurship for
four and a half years. They graduate
with a Bachelors in Engineering and a
Masters in Technology Management.
Pupils then spend a year in an
international university. Imperial will
be hosting 20 REP students in 2014 in
a variety of engineering departments.
Professor Debra Humphris, Vice
Provost (Education), commented
that: “Imperial and NTU are natural
partners.NTUalreadyhostsImperial’s
most important international
collaboration, LKCMedicine, and
the potential for further connections
in engineering education is really
exciting. Imperial is honoured to join
such a prestigious scheme. NTU’s
Renaissance Engineering programme
will only strengthen Imperial’s
already world-class student body in
engineering.”
The Dean of the Faculty of
Engineering, Professor Jeff Magee
stated: “Engineering has a vital
role to play in addressing many of
today’s most important challenges,
and we must inspire and harness
global talent to develop the next
generation of engineering leaders.
NTU’s Renaissance Engineering
Programme aims to do just that and
we at Imperial are very pleased to be
able to contribute to the education of
the students.”
Freddy Boey, the NTU Provost
Professor, said:
“We believe in training our brightest
minds to be leaders and engineers
of the highest calibre, with not just
in-depth knowledge in a specific
field, but also a huge breath of
knowledge that will enable them to
lead interdisciplinary teams to solve
complex problems faced by the world
today. One of the ways can we do
that is to by sending our top students
overseas, to be exposed to and inspired
by other brilliant young minds from
different cultures, nationalities and
disciplines. We are also very pleased to
continue strengthening NTU’s strong
relationship with Imperial College
London through this tie-up, which
will bring a new dimension to learning
and exposure for our students with
their excellent curriculum and their
vast and illustrious network of alumni
worldwide.”

BBOXX Gets Silicon
Valley Funding
with the Union, Campus Services has
decided to make cleaning equipment
more accessible to all students (as
of the above email) and plan to
give students a greater amount of
information about the equipment and
the cleaning services amount halls.
This is a step in the right direction,
however Campus Services does not
seem to have acknowledged the
inconvenience that has been caused
to students so far, including the state
some residents’ rooms have reached
while not able to access cleaning
equipment available for student use.
Last week Felix posed several
questions to Campus Services that
have yet to be answered, including
asking for more information about the
student feedback that was consulted
when making the decision to
reduce bedroom cleaning frequency
(especially in relation to how many
students took part in the feedback
and how many strongly wished to
have their rooms cleaned less often).
Felix also asked about how students
had been actively consulted during
the decision making (as significant
stakeholders) and whether the
department had considered the effects
less frequently cleaned rooms might
have in attracting pests.
Felix still awaits a response from
Campus Services on these issues, as
well as further clarification on the
legal aspect on the decision.
If you have been affected by the
changes to cleaning in halls, or hold
any strong views on the subject,
send a letter to the Editor at felix@
ic.ac.uk.

BOXX, a spinout company
from Imperial, brings
solar energy products to
developing countries has
been given investment
backing from a Silicon Valley venture
capital company. BBOXX have
received $1.5m backing from Vinod
Khosla, who runs a billion dollar
venture capitalist firm. Additionally,
the company has also received
$400,000 from Synergy Growth, a
British venture capital fund.
With 1.4 billion people living without
electricity leading to a poor quality of
life, it is not an unreasonable aim for
BBOXX to try to provide electricity to
20 million by 2020.
BBOXX was founded by a group
Imperial students who graduated in
2010: Mansoor Hamayun, Laurent
Van Houke and Chris Baker-Brian.
Toegether they have created an all-
in-one product for home use that
can be installed easily and cheaply.
The system consists of a solar panel, a
control panel and a battery.
The BBOXX team initially created
a charity called e.quinox at Imperial,
where students produced and installed
solar power in villages in countries
like Tanzania and Rwanda. The CEO
of BBOXX and the founding chairman
of e.quinox, Mansoor Hamayun said
that: “when we set up e.quinox all
those years ago we had no intention of
doing it on a commercial level. The aim
when we established e.quinox was to
deliver solar power for free. However,
to provide power to millions of people
around the world, we knew we needed
more funds and turning our idea into
an ethical, clean technology business
enabled us to raise capital and export
our ideas around the world. With
BBOXX Ltd we wanted to create
the products that did not currently
exist that we knew customers really
wanted”, says Mansoor.
“We realised from early on that
we were providing not only a service
– helping people to generate their
own solar power – but we were also
developing long-term relationships
with customers via sales of products.
This business model is the foundation
for our growing success.”

london underground
plans radical changes
to tube system by
2015
Joseph Letts
Editor-in-Chief
London Underground and the
Mayor of London announced new
changes that will have a large impact
on London’s tube system. Under
the proposed changes by 2015 most
manned ticket offices at tube stations
will be closed, leading to a loss of 750
jobs. These changes have been set in
motion as part of a plan to reduce
TfL’s budget by approximately £50
million every year.
Londoners received a significant
improvement in services as part of
the proposed plans, with several tube
lines (including the Piccadilly, Victoria
and Jubilee lines) set to run 24-hours a
day on Fridays and Saturdays.
These plans, while increasing night-
time mobility for several groups of
people (esp. students.) also modernise
the tube, bringing it closer to the
standard of other systems, such as
New York’s 24/7/365 Subway system.
