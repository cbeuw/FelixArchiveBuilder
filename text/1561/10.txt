Untouchable photons
Photons can often be difficult to
measure because as soon as they are,
they are gone. Most measurement
methods require direct absorption, or
are in some other way destructive to
the nature of the particle. This means
that you have little time to glean all of
the information before it disappears,
and there is no way to double check
your results. Now, if only there was a
way around this. Oh wait, there might
be!

fear into almost any scientist, closely
followed by ‘coursework deadline’ and
‘rent due’. Weird and wonderful things
happen in the quantum world, and if
there was a feasible way to measure
photons without destroying their
nature, many new technologies, such
as quantum computing, could gain
footing. A report by Andreas Reiserer,
Stephan Ritter and Gerhard Rempe
in Science last week puts forward a
different method of measurement:
instead of detecting the photon as you
would a particle, by absorption, why
not detect it as a wave?
One thing waves are really good at
is reflecting. Reflection causes a phase
lag, interference and diffraction in
the photon-wave. The experiment set
up by Reiserer’s team consisted of an
optical resonant chamber containing
a single atom, the walls of which were
superconductive and thus highly
reflective. A photon enters and will
only interact with the atom if it is in
the correct energy state, otherwise it
will reflect off the wall.
Hold on to your hats, because this is
where is gets a little crazy. The atom
enclosed in the chamber is prepared
in a superposition of allowed and
forbidden states. The photon-wave
enters and due to the forbidden state,
is reflected. However, the atom will
change as if it had interacted with the
photon, because it is in an allowed
state. The result is that it appears there
was an interaction, but the photon still
exists! We have measured the presence
of a photon without destroying it.
The team repeated their
experiments, showing the same
photon could be repeatedly detected
without being absorbed. Individual

Mars MAVEN mission launches
This week the latest US mission to
Mars launched successfully; NASA
called the launch “flawless”. The
rocket carrying the Mars Atmosphere
and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN)
spacecraft left the Earth on Monday
from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station
in Florida, the site of many previous
NASA mission launches. Just under
an hour after launch the probe was
released from the rocket, deployed its
solar panels and oriented into cruise
configuration.
“Everything looks good. The signals
are coming in fine, and so far the
systems that are on are reporting back
great. We’re heading out to the Red
Planet,” said David Mitchell, Nasa’s
MAVEN project manager.
The MAVEN mission will be
investigating the upper atmosphere
and the ionosphere of Mars alongside
the solar wind, with the intention
of providing insight into the history
of the Martian atmosphere, climate
and the planet’s habitability. After
a journey of over 440 million miles
and lasting 10 months, MAVEN will
reach Mars and will need to undergo
a check-out period before finally
beginning its primary data collection
mission. This mission is scheduled to
last for one year, but NASA intends
to keep MAVEN operational well
into the future to provide a data-relay
platform for surface explorers such as
the Curiosity Rover.
MAVEN is equipped with eight
data-collection sensors to determine
the characteristics of the upper
atmosphere and the solar wind.
The instruments were designed and
contributed by NASA’s Goddard
Space Flight Centre, the University of
Colorado, Boulder, and the University
of California, Berkeley. The Centre
d’Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements
in France also provided the sensor for
one instrument.
By exploring the composition of
Mars’ upper atmosphere and the
impact that the solar wind has on
the atmosphere, lead investigator Dr
Bruce Jakosky from the University of
Colorado hopes to understand how
Mars went from a wet planet with a
dense atmosphere billions of years ago
to its present arid state.
“The loss rates [of the atmosphere
due to the solar wind] today are
low enough that we’re probably not
going to see the loss of the entire
atmosphere,” says Dr Jakosky. “The
reason we are studying it today, even
though the loss rates are so much
lower, is that we can understand the
specific processes that are going on
and learn how to extrapolate them
back in time.”
photons were able to be detected
with a 77% success rate, while close
to 66% of the photons would survive
reflection. This was enough to prove
their non-destructive measurement
method. Though it may take a while
to refine the process, this is sure to
prove effective in quantum optics,
computing and entanglement.
