2008 – Dow Jones Industrial Average reaches
its lowest level since 1997 but thankfully it
resolves itself pretty quickly and this moment is
virtually forgotten.
1985 – Microsoft releases Windows 1.0, which,
whilst now fairly old, is still much, much better
than Vista.
1962 – The Cuban Missile Crisis ends just
in time for Kennedy to be assassinated. This
cements forever the popularity arising from his
one legitimate success. Although in your case,
universal popularity will probably arise from
the act of dying.
1910 – Start of the Mexican Revolution.
Although, I bet you’re so ignorant that you
neither knew Mexico had a revolution, let
alone against whom they were revolting (it was
against long-term autocrat Porfirio Diaz BTW).
1686 – Charles Francois Felix operates on King
Louis XIV of France’s anal fistula, which is
definitely something you needed to know right
now as you eat your lunch.
1307 – William Tell shoots an apple off the top
of his son’s head in one shot. Whilst this strikes
a blow to the Swiss nobility, it does leave his son
with severe trust issues for the rest of his life.

GREENDITORIAL
Comment Wisely Follows Hangman’s Lead
F
ollowing the publication
in Hangman last week
of an extremely self-
referential article, another
Felix Section, Comment,
has wisely followed suit.
Quickly realising that another
ingenious idea had emerged from
the depths of the Hangman mind,
Comment Editors Eoghan Totten
and Tessa Davey churned out
A
fter the announcement
this week that Hull
is to be the UKs City
of Culture in 2017,
this reporter can
confirm that yes, this is indeed the
same Hull that’s situated in the East
of the UK on the Humber Estuary.
The announcement also implies
the discovery of a previously
undocumented source of culture in
Hull, a revelation that will come as a
shock to many.
Naturally, the choice of a city –
previously believed to have never
been contacted by culture – raises
the question of how the selection
committee defined ‘Culture’ in their
criteria.
This decision, however, does not
come without precedent. Many still
remember the confusing time when
Liverpool was declared European
Capital of Culture to the bemusement
of all other European cities who largely
did not consider Steven Gerrard to be
particularly cultural.
an appropriately self-referential
article (see Comment Section).
In a piece that included multiple
references to both previous
Comment articles and the Comment
Section itself, Editor Eoghan
Totten successfully imitated
Hangman’s own distinctive style.
However, whilst Hangman Editor,
Hangman, praised the attempt by
his fellow section editor, Hangman
did go on to state that it “could
have been more self-referential”
before adding, “frankly there was
more than one reference to a world

Hangman Editor
A
rtic Drilling Station
– Following the
release of Greenpeace
activists by the Russian
state this week, this
editor believes the World’s nations
are not doing enough to suppress
environmental campaigners
and, indeed, activists in general.
This writer feels that the Russian
judiciary were far too lenient in
releasing these stupid and annoying
protesters after a mere 30 days in gaol.
It is often forgotten just how much
of a nuisance to everyday state
activities these one-issue tossers are.
Those tents in Parliament Square, for
example. They’re ruining the views
for not only the tourists but also our
humble, hard-working MPs as they
enter and exit the House of Commons.
Ultimately, we should be encouraging
the World’s governments to arrest
even more of these lazy, good-for-
nothing, boring fuckers who can’t see
beyond they’re single-minded and
frankly selfish issue.
As reluctant as this editor is to criticise
the normally excellent response by the
Putin and the Russian government
to unnecessary opposition, this must
constitute a missed opportunity and
dangerous show of clemency. So,
shout at protestors; arm the police;
increase the number of days someone
can be held without charge and our
government might just be able to get
some work done.
