FRIDAY 22 NOV
MUSIC
Stuart Masson & Forrest Seiwald report back on About Time festival
ast Saturday saw the
Bussey Building in
Peckham play host to
About Time #2. A day
festival chocked full of
the best in UK emo, screamo and
noise rock is tough to say no to, so
we headed down to check out some
bands. The two stages were staggered
so you could see everything, and we
did our best.
First up were Healing Powers, a
shouty punk band from Durham who
are definitely one to keep an eye on.
As good as the music was (and it was
great), the main thing we took away
was their stage presence. A lead singer
who, whilst angrily shouting, looked
really cheerful as he bobbed up and
down and a bassist who never once
turned to face the crowd. Certainly
a spectacle. Next up was COP, a
noisy punk band who were enjoyable
if not, er, hugely memorable… next
band! Mars to Stay are a jangly
slowcore band whose live showing
was pretty weak. The guitar was a bit
too loud and it all felt a bit over the
top. Playlounge brought the tempo
back up with a set of two-man noise
rock that can only be described as a
No Age clone. Don’t worry though,
they are really good at it and a band
I’d definitely recommend. Cosmic
Thoughts were another noisy punk
band and the first two songs blew us
away and then they played a slow song
that never seemed to end. Luckily
Twisted didn’t slow down once – a
pulsating set of exciting noise rock
with some absolutely brilliant riffs.
Definitely a great discovery! Carson
Wells were on next. A fantastic
screamo band from Aberdeen who
were already a firm favourite with one
of the group. Luckily, they didn’t fail
to deliver, and we all left thoroughly
impressed. Sadly, the next band were
not so popular amongst our group.
Blood Sport are best (and kindly)
described as a shit Battles. By this
point the vegan food stall had set up,
so a burger each definitely helped
deal with it. At this point there was
an hour and a half break due to a play
happening in the building. We took
the time to recuperate in a local pub
and then got straight back to it.
First after the break were the
incredible We Came Out Like
Tigers, a black metal screamo combo
who use a violin and spoken word
sections as well as the more expected
blast beats and brutal vocals. This
perfomance was mindblowing. A
frontman who spent the set violently
throwing himself around the crowd
just helped add to the mesmerising
nature of it all. It was definitely
something extremely different,
L
but it really was
spectacular. The fact
that we all loved this
so much despite the
polarising nature of
the genres involved
really shows that
there can still be
beauty in brutality.
Human Hands
were pretty decent,
but we were all still
recovering from the
majesty of the band
before. Up next were Well Wisher,
an upbeat emo-punk band who put
on a really enjoyable show, whilst
not being something to write home
about. Plaids definitely are an emo
band who take heavy inspiration
from first wave emo but still sound
fresh and exciting. They didn’t
disappoint live either, delivering a
great set of all their best tracks. Nai
Harvest were on next, and they didn’t
disappoint either – a noodley, twinkly
midwest emo act who a couple of
us have been big fans of for a while
now. They are also a band who have
disappointed live in the past. Not this
time. This time they were spot on.
Up next was something very special.
Raein are the kingpins of the Italian
screamo scene (it’s a thing). They are
crushingly heavy when they want,
but also capable of beautiful melody
and anthemic singalongs at the drop
of a hat. This performance blew the
place apart. I’m still finding bruises
all over my body and my arm still isn’t
completely working but I don’t regret
a single second. The main highlight
was definitely the entire front section
losing its shit for a spectacular
singalong performance of Tigersuit.
The penultimate act was Joanna
Gruesome, a noisey twee pop act
who put on a great show. Highlights
included a great cover of Galaxie
500’s ‘Tugboat’ and the guitarist
and bassist (who spent most of the
set in the crowd) being lifted above
the crowd’s heads against their will
as they attempted to play their last
song. Headliners were Joan of Arc,
Sixteen Fantastic Bands and It’s About Time!
fronted by Tim Kinsella of Cap’n Jazz
and Owls fame. It was a really nice,
mellow way to end the night. Sadly,
due to a few problems that happened
with the venue, they were cut short
and only played for 35 minutes.
This was a spectacularly good
day out. A fantastic advert for both
the UK emo scene and DIY shows
in general. 16 bands, most of whom
were great, several of whom were
beyond great. There may have been
a few issues with timings towards
the end, but that was out of the
promoters’ hands, and to be honest,
didn’t hugely detract from us having
fun.
I can say for sure that I will be
making an appearance at About Time
#3!
A
fter two consecutive
number two albums
and massive sets sup-
porting both Eminem
at Reading and Prodigy
at Creamfields, Chase & Status have
become one of the few dance acts with
a crossover appeal large enough to play
an arena tour in support of their most
recent album, Brand New Machine.
Whereas Pendulum or Prodigy did
extended runs of late shows at Brixton
Academy during the heights of their re-
spective popularities, Chase & Status’
show at a venue that hosted One Direc-
tion for nine sold-out shows earlier this
year produced some bizarre contradic-
tions, such as MC Rage encouraging
fans to rave late into the night despite an
11pm curfew and £5 drinks.
The O2’s lack of suitability for dance
music did not get in the way of a good
time however. The 20,000 tickets to the
show sold out well in advance and most
fans arrived very early to listen to the
strong support bill on offer. Pusha T is
featured on one of the standout tracks
from Brand New Machine (‘Machine
Gun’) and so was a natural choice to sup-
port at such a large show. His affiliation
with Kanye West’s GOOD Music label
has given him large numbers of follow-
ers in the UK and so his performance
was thoroughly enjoyed. A fellow drum
and bass producer, Netsky, was selected
as the main support and did not disap-
point. He assembled an excellent band
for his live show and they flew through
many dance anthems in a half hour set,
finishing with Netsky’s anthemic remix
of ‘Everyday’ by Rusko.
With the crowd properly hyped for the
main act, Chase & Status came onstage
and flew through their first few songs.
While playing their second song, ‘Inter-
national’
, a blackout occurred and the
rest of the song and ‘No Problem’
, which
followed, were played in darkness. MC
Rage informed the crowd that a particu-
larlydestructivethrowndrinkhadhitthe
lighting board and encouraged a chorus
of boos towards the culprits. Neither
the band nor the crowd let the technical
malfunction dampen their spirits and as
the lights came back on, Tempa T burst
onto the stage as the first guest vocalist
of the night to help deliver an incredible
rendition of Hypest Hype. Chase & Sta-
tus played through many of the songs on
their later two albums but also included
a few songs from their debut, More Than
Alot. The show was spectacular, with
Chase and Status themselves playing
synths and sequencers from behind a gi-
ant, illuminated C and S and explosions
of pyrotechnics accompanying heavier
parts of songs. MC Rage filled the brief
pauses between songs by keeping the
crowd jumping and anticipating what
was to come. Many more vocalists came
out to add to the show, such as Liam Bai-
ley during the excellent ‘Blind Faith’ and
Jacob Banks during Alive, and in cases
where the singer was busy their face
would be displayed on the giant screens
aroundthearena(‘DelilahduringTime’).
The two hour set sped by with the en-
ergy levels remaining high throughout.
Just as the crowd were preparing for a
nightofdancing,theencorewasuponus
and Chase & Status finished on a high,
tearing through an aggressive cover of
‘Killing in the Name’ by Rage Against
the Machine and finishing on the up-
tempo ‘Fool Yourself’
. Chase & Status
definitely put on a show worthy of any
rock band currently touring but they
have had to sacrifice some things in pur-
suit of commercial success. The 11pm
finish meant the harder fans would be
off to other events to dance the night
away whereas a few years ago Chase &
Status would be playing that two hour
set at 4am in Fabric with fans having just
as good a time and I am sure a part of
them still wishes that was the case. Their
gig was an excellent showcase of many
different dance genres (from jungle to
house to trap to drum and bass) and
their ability to produce a cohesive album
using all these influences and then tour
it imaginatively and energetically has
gained them many fans and allows them
to retain the underground credibility
that first brought them to attention.
