As the virgin emerald
buds blossom forth her-
alding that magic time
when men's hearts beat
faster and their thoughts
and hands start to wan-
der, that pathetic animal,
the third year undergrad-
uate, defies his instinc-
tive tendencies and de-
votes every waking sec-
ond to the decipherment
of the incomprehensible
drivel he has accumu-
lated over the past eight
terms. The more astute
members of this herd
will be sacrificing some
of those waking sec-
onds pondering that im-
ponderable of all im-
ponderables.
"What the bloody hell
am I going to do next
year?"
Ponder no longer, the
answer is nigh, salvation
is at hand. . . .
. . . LUBRICATION!
Four syllables that re-
vitalise the future for
the graduate-to-be with
an interdisciplinary bent.
What? . . . Lubrication
Research, alias "Tribol-
ogy". Investigation and
experimentation ranging
from improving helicop-
ter gears, through all
branches of elastohydro-
dynamics (Experimental
& Theoretical) to the
design and development
of both high and low
pressure thin oil film
viscometers.
Where? . . . The Lub-
rication Laboratory, 599
Mechanical Engineering
(Enismore after 5.30
p.m.)
Who? . . . YOU!
Whether you be engin-
eer, chemist, physicist,
mathematician, metal-
lurgist, computer scien-
tist, parapsychologist,
flat earthist, Erick Von
Daniken, Alf Ramsey or
Bob Janousek we have

The first side con-
tains their new single
"Harem Scarem" which
is an up tempo, almost
Rock 'n Roll number.
The rhythm is much
more noticeable, prob-
ably to help direct it to
the likely buyers of sin-
gles. Of the others one
is a piano concerto, an-
other has an Elizabe-
than flavour and the
final track is very heavy,
with pounding drums,
bells, cymbals and
harsh use of the organ.
I personally think that
it's the best they've pro-
duced though it has
been mentioned that
snatches are not very
original, appearing to be
straight cribs from, for
example, the Beatles.
a mind bending problem
(off the peg) to suit your
particular talents.
How? . . . Drop into
the lab. whenever you
are passing, preferably
between 11.30 a.m. and
12.15 p.m. or 2.30 p.m.
and 3.15 p.m., for a
chat with the present in-
mates. If you think you
could fit in with our
style, work rate and at-
mosphere and we in turn
think we could tolerate
such an inferior being
as yourself, then we will
arrange a meeting for
you with Prof. A . Cam-
eron, ithe power behind
the throng. Those of you
with real initiative will
cut out the middle men
and go straight to Prof.
Cameron (Room 704
Mech Eng). Either way
you will be able to get
all the information you
need on our postgradu-
ate research leading to
PhDs.
Why? . . . That's
really up to you to an-
swer. You must want to
do research, and enjoy
the less obvious bene-
fits that postgraduate
work has to offer. But if
money is your main cri-
terion then the extra
£100 we add to the SRC
p.g. grant does little to
bring the pay in line with
the salaries available in
industry.
The most obvious
benefit of course, is that
after three years you
will have a PhD degree
of an applied nature, en-
abling you to decide at
that stage whether you
wish to remain an aca-
demic or go into indus-
try With your eyes fully
opened. Those three
years will not be spent
doing research alone.
The lab. has an excellent
community spirit and its
Imperial College Con-
servative Society exists
for all the College to
learn and practise Con-
servatism. We have links
with the Conservative
Party, the Bow Group,
F.C.S., and the Monday
Club, and through the
information they are
able to give (the Bow
Group especially is re-
sponsible for accurate
research and intelligent
thought) we can offer
discussion of the facts
and people that matter,
at our policy meetings,
usually held in hall
somewhere, over sherry
and biccies.
Our policies at the
moment are twofold:
one, to inform everyone
of the facts behind Con-
servatism and secondly
to propagate Conserva-
tism in the college. To
this end we are at the

Another brain drain is
due in 1976, Lord Bow-
den, principal of the
Manchester Institute of
Science and Techno-
logy, predicted at a con-
ference organized by
the university's careers
and appointments ser-
vice, and held about
two weeks ago.
He was arguing that
inflation was diverting
the wealth of Britain
into non - productive
work so that graduate
recruitment into produc-
tive industry was falling
off. The same was hap-
pening in the United
States, he said, but
since it was ahead in
getting out of the de-
pression, it would start
a new recruiting drive
sooner than Britain.
The fall-off in recruit-
ment was also affecting
enrolment on under-
graduate courses to
such an extent that in
three year's time British
industry would hardly
have any trained young
men and the ones there
Postgra d u a t e re-
search is a quite cheap
source of support to
both research and
teaching activities in
university departments
according to a state-
ment issued recently by
the Senate of Strath-
clyde University.
The Senate, which is
highly critical of the re-
cent House of Commons
Expenditure Commit-
tee's report on post-
graduate education,
says that any drop in
postgraduate research
would have immediate
and serious consequen-
ces.
"Critics are in gene-
ral plainly unaware of
the linked relationship
in universities between
staff, postgraduates and
undergraduates," says
the senate, whose state-
ment has been sent to
members of b o t h
Houses of Parliament,
principals a n d vice-
chancellors of all Bri-
tish universities and
many other interested
bodies and individuals.
Recent publications,
including the Expendi-
ture Committee's report,
had implied that much
university postgraduate
study was a luxury
which could be trim-
med without loss either
NUSS:
The NUSS (National
Union of School Stu-
dents) have been pro-
ducing press state-
ments recently about
NALGO, and about a
children's strike in Not-
tingham.
"It is IMPERITIVE",
declares the statement,
"that pupils are able to
use the facilities avail-
able at public libraries."
This arises from the
NALGO action over
London allowances. The
NUSS are afraid that

DRAIN
were would go to the
United States.
Lord Bowden said
that the consequences
of inflation were so ap-
palling that unless the
problem was solved he
despaired of the future.
Inflation had gone so
far that in the past few
years it was possible
for people to be living in
houses that were earn-
ing more than they
were. The increase in
the book value of about
18 million houses last
year was £45,000-
£50,000m., which was as
great as the total dom-
estic products.
Returns on short-term
building society loans
were 15 to 2 0 % last
year but ICI's returns
were only 5% and the
paper trade 2%. As the
to the nation's economy
or to its academic life.
"The tendentious
nature of this approach
can be detected both
in the use of language
and in the deployment
of statistics," the senate
says.
"When an official re-
port speaks of the 'cosy
academic atmosphere'
we may well suspect the
objectivity of its authors
and their familiarity with
university life."
The report argued
that too many talented
young graduates slip-
ped into postgraduate
work because "it must
seem to them to be a
natural progression
after a good first de-
gree": but if an honours
degree had not stimu-
lated the student's intel-
lectual curiosity, had it
not failed in its purpose?
It was all very well to
talk about immediately
relevant studies, but no-
body really knew either
which particular ad-
vance in knowledge
would ultimately be
socially relevant or how
training in research
might ultimately be de-
ployed.
A recent working
group of the British
Association had pointed
out that scientific re-
Illiterates
"many school students
will be denied the facili-
ties available in libraries
for referance".
Other mistakes were:
"immiediate educationaI
crisis in London"; "re-
spective responsobili-
ties"; "effects" used as
a verb instead of
"affects", "remidy";
"suposedly" and "re-
instation" used twice
instead of "re-in state-
ment."
These statements
both bear the address
community valued pro-
ductive industry less
than speculators, how
could one seriously ad-
vise a schoolboy to be-
come a chemical en-
gineer?
Lord Bowden pointed
out that students are in-
fluenced early on by the
prospect of not being
able to g"et a job. The
Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in the
United States had pro-
duced 29 graduates in
chemical engineering
last year compared with
its usual output of about
100.
As for metallurgy, on
which the prospects for
atomic energy depend-
ed, the USSR had pro-
duced 5,000 graduates
last year and Japan
3,000, whereas Britain
had produced only 200.
Four years ago it was
difficult for metallurgists
to get jobs and the re-
sult was that UMIST had
only been able to enrol
six undergraduates this
year although they had
the capacity for 36.
search provided a back-
stop for much of tech-
nology. "Set up against
this wider view, the alle-
gations that this or that
employer has no im-
mediate need for PhDs
seem trivial and are in
any event not borne out
by our experience".
The postgraduate was
not simply a sponge; he
presented a challenge
to staff and an example
to undergraduates.
Furthermore, post-
graduate study was the
proving ground for
future university staff.
"Nobody would pre-
tend that the possession
of a PhD is the sole cri-
terion of potentiality as
a university teacher, but
it removes one big area
of uncertainty in the
minds of selectors," the
senate says.
Professor S. G . E.
Lythe, the university's
vice-principal, said that
the university's research
committee considered
that no serious attempt
had been made to pro-
duce a reasoned reply
to the Expenditure Com-
mittee's report. The pur-
pose of Strathclyde's
statement was to pre-
sent some of the short-
coming of the MP's re-
commendations.

and are badly pro-
duced, with atrocious
typing and line-spacing.
This is obviously not
going to do any of their
causes any good. The
NUSS may appear, to
some, to be a good idea.
To me, it never has and
issues such as this only
go to prove it.
Maybe the N U S
should take time off
from bashing racialists
and spend more time
removing illiteracy so
that up and coming stu-
dents can understand
and produce decent
