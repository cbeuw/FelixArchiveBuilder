14th May, 1974 FELIX 3
» Thursday May 2nd saw Imperial College Union
General Meeting back in the Great Hall after a break
due to the power crisis (remember that?). A varied
agenda pulled in one of the largest attendances if!
a long while, with a quorum nearly being reached.
The reports took up the first part of the meeting,
with discussion livening up when Mr. Wadsworth
reported on the Union Exec's stand over Essex Uni-
versity (basically outlined by Norm Sayles in his
purple patch last issue). Mr. John Lane, last year's
President, asked a number of questions which were
answered by varying members of the Exec. Several
of the replies brought howls of approval, showing
the mass of suport that existed for the Executive's
line. Eventually it was proposed that the report be
accepted. This was done, overwhelmingly so, there-
by showing to the more militant aspects of the Union
that they were not repre-
sentative of the majority
feeling over this issue.
Elections took up the
majority of the remain-
der, with three candi-
dates for the post of
SCAB Chairman and nine
candidates for the six _________________________________
floor reps on Council. ' "~ ™ 1
Due to this excess of candidates there was little
time left at the end of the meeting for debate. This
was made even more difficult by the fact that most
people appeared to have come for the elections
only, and there was a considerable drop in the num-
bers present when these had finished.
The first motion on the agenda referred to the
NUS's motion on Racialism and Overseas or par-
ticularly the section referring to the disruption of
meetings held by Racialist groups. This arose mainly
from the members of the college Conservative Soc-
iety and appeared to have quite a large amount of
support at the meeting. However, after we had had
the proposal speech there was a move to move
straight to a vote. Seeing that the meeting was be-
hind the motion and was almost certain to pass it
U.G.M.
so that it would become Union policy Mr. East, that
famous IMG figure, decided that in the interests of
democratic freedom he would challenge the quorum.
There wasn't a quorum present and so the meeting
was closed.
It is important to realise that at the moment, in
the absence of any definite policy. Imperial College
Union would be regarded by the world at large as
supporting this despicable piece of NUS garbage.
The reasoning behind the NUS amendment (which
supports any action that members may care< to take
against racialist speakers, including the disruption
of their meetings) is illogical. Judging from the cov-
erage it has been receiving in the press (both from
letters and articles) it is fairly apparent that what
little esteem existed in the public's eye for the
NUS has now all but disappeared following the
passing of this amend-
~ ~ — —

ment. It is also important
to realise that it was not
passed on a majority
vote. The voting figures
for the amendment were
204,618 for, 182,760
against, and 57,625 ab-
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ stained. This was not a

' ~ " ~ ~ ~ ' —
majority vote. The rea-
son that the overall motion was voted in so hea-
vily, was because it does contain a lot of very good
policy.
A Union meeting has been called for Thursday,
23rd May, mainly because we have to elect a dele-
gation for the NUS emergency conference, to be
held in mid-June, that has been called to discuss
our attitude to the announcement on grants for
1974/75. Hopefully, there will also be enough time
at our meeting for us to be able to discuss the
racialism motion and be able to express our feelings
and attitudes towards it publicly.
PLEASE SUPPORT THE NEXT MEETING. IT IS
IN THE INTERESTS OF THE UNION—AND THE
UNION IS YOU

Call for increase by
College committee
Following its second
meeting last Tuesday the
Exploratory Committee
is expected to come out
in favour of higher
grants for postgraduates,
rejecting the proposals
for a system of loan sup-
plements contained in
the House of Common's
Expenditure Commit-
tee's report on Postgrad-
uate Education.
After discussions on
the Students' Union's
request for a rejection
of these loans in princi-
ple, the committee de-
cided that it should state
what it felt to be the
ideal situation without
considering any possible
restrictions either finan-
cial or political which
might constrain the gov-
ernment. In accordance
with these principles the
committee will call for
a full grant for postgra-
duates to be fixed at the
level of the average net
R C S A
ALL 3RD YEAR PHYSICS
PLEASE NOTE
In an effort to make the RCSA become a "more
meaningful concept to the grass roots" a new idea
is being tried out for all people in 3rd year Physics
this term. Several volunteers, namely (ego trips
here) Miss Caroline Bingham, Miss Penny Thoro-
good, Mrs. Jaquetta Selley, Mr. Dave Dawson, Mr.
lap Oram, and Mr. Andy Lewcock, have agreed to
act as live "dead-letter-boxes" in order to keep
people from this year's Physics II in touch with
each other and with the RCSA.
As this gallant throng of Physicists (?) goes into
the great wide world to seek employment, it is
hqped that each one of them will write at least once
a year to one of the people listed above, just to
keep in touch. Not only will this enable anyone
from the year to be contacted and told of RCSA
(or Physics II) reunions, booze-ups, etc., but it does
have a serious side to it. As the great Alfred E.
Newman once said: "Learn by others' mistakes, 'cos
you will never make enough yourself". Applying this
mastery of logic to our cause, anyone in the 1974
Physics II will be able to write into one of the dead-
letter-boxes, or the RCSA and request information
or help( for instance in the case of accommodation
in the West Country); this request will then be sent
to the member(s) of the year who are most likely
to be able to help/and hopefully the two 'physicists'
can then resolve the problem between them.
This provides a new dimension to the RCSA.
Not only does it deal with RCS as a whole, but it
helps to keep year groups together; not only does
it fulfil a social function, but it Has a very worth-
while and serious aspect to it.
The whole year-group organisation is being spon-
sored by the RCSA, and it is hoped that you (Yes,
that's you Physics III, stop falling asleep in the
back row, who threw that dart?), all of you, will
join the RCSA, however I must point out that it is
not essential to do so before your name is added
to our mailing list.
So, now (apart from producing £15 life-member-
ship fee) all you have to do is decide whom you
wish to write to-' Caroline, Penny, Jaquetta, Dave,
lan or Andy. (If you don't know any of them, pick
a name and write anyway. You could be pleasantly
surprised).
OK. That's it. Finished now.

Union General Awards
and social colours
Nominations are in-
vited for both of the
above.
Union General Awards
are the top honour that
the Union can award and
there are rarely more
than six awarded in any
one year. The decision
on these nominations lies
with the President, Norm
Sayles. If you think you
know of someone who
deserves one of these
awards then write, de-
tailing the person's con-
tribution to the Union,
to the President, care of
the Union Office. Please
mark your envelope with
U.G.A. in the top left-
hand corner. Remember,
to have a hope of win-
ning one of these the
person nominated must
have done, to put it
mildly, "a h**l of a lot
of work".
Union Social Colours
are a lower level award
for those who have spent
an exceptional amount
of time and effort work-
ing for the Union. These
are awarded by the Col-
ours Committee. Nomin-
ation for social colours
arising out of work for
an RCC, SCC or ACC
club, and various other
Union bodies come dir-
ect from those bodies
and nominations should,
in the first case, be ad-
dressed to these. There
are, however, people
who just do general
work and need separate
nominations. If you wish
to nominate members
for Social Colours write
to Paul Wadsworth, c/o
The Union Office, and
mark y o u r envelope
"Social Colours". Nom-
inations close on Friday,
3ist May.
starting salary of an en-
trant (with a first deg-
ree) into the Scientific
Civil Service. This grant
to be automatically in-
creased in line with the
salary increases of the
academic staff.
The proposal to in-
crease fees for overseas
students whilst offering
scholarships to students
from developing coun-
tries, and reciprocal ar-
rangements to students
from t h e developed
countries was thought to
be impractical particu-
larly in this college
where over forty coun-
tries would be involved.
It was thought that an
increase in fees to £1500
per annum would result
in a "catastrophic" fall
in the applications from
overseas and in severe
financial difficulties for
many of the overseas
students already here.

Latest
S t u d e n t s Ronnie
Hunch and Will Rich,
who were sent down by
the Disciplinary Commit-
tee of Essex University
were reinstated by an
Appeals Committee. The
A p p e a l s Committee
which consists of two
members of staff and
one student, sat on
Tuesday, May 7th, and
will meet again to con-
sider the case of Halford
Hewitt the other student
to be sent down. It is
expected that Hewitt will
also be reinstated.
However, at a hearing
of the Disciplinary Com-
mittee on Wednesday,
May 8th, a student on
sabbatical leave, lan
Glen, was sent down for
a year for being on cam-
pus. It seems that at
Essex, a student who
takes sabbatical leave is
barred from campus.
Glen, who did not join
the Union's picket line,
was not available for
comment.
