PROTECTION
OF THE
ENVIRONMENT
On May 3rd, PAN/Ballantine, in
association with Friends of the Earth
published a revised and up-dated
edition of Jonathan Holliman's
" C O N S U M E R ' S GUIDE TO THE
PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRON-
MENT (50p). In this he aims to look
at several major areas of goods and
services and explains, simply and
clearly, the environmental costs of
their production, use and disposal.
Most people must be aware by
now that the interest in our environ-
ment1
and the protection of the
Earth's limited resources has risen
greatly. This was amply shown with
the oil crisis at the turn of the year.
This year has also seen an increase
in the number of organisations that
are prepared to "re-cycle" goods for
re-use. At college we now re-cycle
computer paper, several corporation
cleansing departments are collect-
ing glass and paper separately.

MEDICINE
HEAD
Thru' A Five
This is the first album from the
group since it enlarged from a duo
to a quintet, last October. The addi-
tion of former Family drummer Rob
Townsend, ex Freedom Star Roger
Saunders (guitars and keyboards),
and West Indian George Ford (bass
guitars), has done a lot to broaden
the sojnd of the group and widen
the total textures of their music. I
also feel that their addition has given
the group more freedom of expres-
sion—particularly in the vocals. The
rhythm section of the band has ob-
viously been strengthened, but the
n-sw members of the band don't
seem to have stimulated many new
ideas here. The rhythm on all but
tour of the tracks is, to all intents
and purposes, the same as that used
on "One and One is One". On the

This album, second in a series of
6, is purely electronic, composed by
Burt Alcantara, it uses A R P and R S E
Synthesizers. "ZYGOAT" however,
is rr cM'eC'ion of electronic
sounding violins, woodwinds, voices
. . . On this album, the synthesizers
are used to produce sounds only a
synthesizer could produce.
Burt Alcantara is a 32 year old
New Yorker. He studied clarinet, sax
and, piano at an early age, later
moved to conga and timpani and was
admitted to the Julliard Academy
where he studied from 1959-64. He
has worked with the American Bal-
to save on our resources is to cut
down on the rate at which we use
them. The main aim of the book is
to show the numerous ways that are
available for doing this.
"Use cloth napkins, hand towels,
handkerchiefs and nappies instead
of throw-away paper ones . . ."
He heavily slams several parts of
our society today. The advertising
industry for "Deceiving customers as
to the real merits of a product. . .",
"The family that willingly has a large
number of children . . .".
The book is full of very fine senti-
ments indeed but what chance is
there of them being widely accep-
ted. How many of the Ordinary work-
ing class people, who make up the
majority of any population, are going
to read this book and therefore know
what resources they are wasting?
Unfortunately it needs massive cam-
paigns to try and put over, these
ideas, but the easiest way to finance
this would be through industry, and
it is not likely that industry is going
to encourage the consumer to buy
less of its products.
The book is well written and
makes very interesting reading. How-
ever, words are not what is wanted.
other tracks the group don't seem
to have achieved any new positive
identity and direction in their music.
Whilst the album is pleasant there
are few exceptional moments. Disre-
garding the singles the best tracks
for me were "Changin' Man",
"Rain", and "Indian Queen". These
didn't resort to the "One and One"
rhythm and showed a lot of imagin-
ation and a lot of promise for the
future.
I feel that whilst there are some
good individual performances on the
album, the album fails to succeed
because the group haven't been to-
gether long enough. Perhaps they
will be fully integrated when they re-
cord the next album. To sum up, this
is an album which retains some of
the old Medicine Head whilst
branching out in new directions. The
general direction of the band
though, isn't evident. Although the
album shows a lot of promise for the
future there's nothing really out-
standing about it—is just remains a
nice average album.

The first thing that strikes with this
album is the cover. An impression of
a small ruined village, overseen by
an upright, human faced goat, a
fabulous palace in the background
and a foetus hovering above. The
album itself is rather more difficult
to describe. It is a fine album, and
although Burt Alcantara doesn't try
to imitate other instruments directly
he doesn't reach the other extreme
and produce a lot of. noise with no
musical content. Most of the album
contains gentle sounds with a
steady rhythm, although there are
times when he produces a much
harsher feeling.
To me, this is how synthesizers
should be used.
HITCH-HIKERS
GUIDE TO
EUROPE
Some time ago i was lucky enough
to be able to spend some time on
the continent, hitch-hiking. This can
especially be fun when, like me, you
speak only English and not even the
rudiments of a foreign language.
However, on that tour, I was able
to get an immense amount of help,
facts and information from a paper-
back "HITCH-HIKER'S GUIDE TO
E U R O P E " by Ken Walsh. This has
recently been produced in a 4th re-
vised edition for 1974.
The layout of the book is very
easy to follow. The first part is taken
up with general hints on hitching
and basic survival:
" A friend of mine once got an
attack (of diarrhoea) in Algeria.
He was in the middle of nowhere
. . . . had no paper except a book
he hadn't read. He tells of sitting
on the side of the road, frantically
reading page after page so he'd
have a back-log of paper to see
him through his next attack".
The majority of the remainder is
split into chapters on different coun-
teries ranging from Ireland to Iran
and Norway to Tunisia with all the
REFUGEE
Refugee
Patrick Moraz is someone you'll
be hearing a lot more of in the years
to come. For he's a Swiss key-
boards/synthesiser player, stroke
composer, who sets Refugee's debut
album alight with his artistic and
highly immaginative display of key-
board virtuosity. He might not have
the road experience of Emerson and
Wakeman, but he's made up for that
with a complete mastery of the key-
board instruments. He's no mean
composer either, and his Swiss in-
fluence on the band's material brings
a delightful and refreshing new
sound to the rock industry. Whilst I
immensely enjoy their shorter tracks
(Papillion, Someday and Ritt Mick-
ley) their more ambitious tracks
which are neo-classical in nature,
contain a great depth of feeling, in

Hamburger
Concerto
Writing record reviews at gone
5.00 a.m., after just having seen the
dawn is quite an experience. How-
ever, to get down to business. Focus,
Holland's top band, and one of
Europe's best have udergone sev-
eral line-up changes recently. Their
latest album "HAMBURGER CON-
CERTO" still has Thijs Van Leer
(keyboards (9 of) flutes, voices and
whistling) and Jan Akkerman (gui-
tars, lute, handclaps) as the remain-
ing members of the original. In
addition there is Bert Ruiter (bass
and various other instruments) who
first appeared on Focus 3, and Colin
Allen, a new English addition
(drums and percussion).
The title track (or work) takes
countries in between (i.e. Europe, N.
Africa, and the Middle East) and the
Eastern Bloc countries. The largest
sections are devoted, as you might
expect, to the main European coun-
tries (France, Germany, Italy etc.).
There is information on the best en-
trances and exits from the countries,
something that can be especially
useful if you're planning to pass
straight through as fast as possible
to reach your destination. The capi-
tal of each country is listed with de-
tails as to the cheapest places to
stay and the sights to see. There is
also a "tourist's" guide to the beauty
spots and-works of wonder.
The remainder is full of different
regulations for working and work
permits, a very brief language and
currency guide, and tips and com-
ments from readers.
Without this book it would still be
possible to do the trip, but in a much
more disorganised and unsatisfac-
tory manner. There were times when
the information it contains was in-
valuable and I personally would not
be without it whilst hitching on the
continent.
Copies are available from the col-
lege bookshop at only 50p each. It is
regarded by some as the hitcher's
"bible". I'd just say that it was the
third most important thing I took
with me, the others being my pass-
port and my money (and I saved a
lot of the latter using the book).

fact much more feeling than the
more recent Yes albums. All the
same Refugee aren't out to copy
Yes, E L P or Pink Floyd, even though
there are slight similarities. Their
sound does, though, remind me of
the old Nice sound. But that's not
surprising since the three-man band
contains ex-Nice members, Lee
Jackson and Brian Davison.
For a debut album it's extremely
good, and if Refugee continue as
they have started Keith Emerson will
soon be kicking himself for having
left. My only one criticism is perhaps
with the longer tracks (Great Can-
yon Suite and Credo). At times I
found my attention beginning to
wander; but there again Refugee
have only been together for a matter
of months, and in that short time you
don't expect the band to achieve the
degree of co-ordination that E L P
and Yes have. To sum up, a great
debut album from Refugee who, if
they go on like this, should soon be
among the ELP's, the Yes's and the
Pink Floyds—if not above them.

up all of the second side and is (with
the exception of a few yodels and
some short foreign lyrics (dutch?))
instrumental. Although there are six
named tracks within this work, and
each can actually be picked out on
the acetate, they do run through into
each other to give a single, com-
plete work.
Throughout this the lead is split
between Van Leer on his keyboards
and Akkerman on lead guitar. The
rhythm is steady without being over-
powering, with Colin Allen produc-
ing a competent first showing. Van
Lee tends to get the majority of the
lead (on organ, synthesizer and
piano) but the longest single section
gives Akkerman a free rein to show
his prowess. Although each section
has its own particular feeling they
blend excellently to build into a
climax in the final two, short tracks.
