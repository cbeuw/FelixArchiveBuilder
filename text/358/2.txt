LETTERS
U.G.M.'s
& Free Speech
from T. Phillips
Sir
I am writing regarding
the U G M of May 2nd.
It may be as well to
clear up some miscon-
ceptions which have
arisen, and to make a
few comments on the
conduct of the meeting.
This can be done by out-
lining the proceedings
chronologically.
At 2.13 p.m. the ballot
for the floor reps was
completed. At this point
Mr. Lolley called the
quorum several times.
Those who remained at
the meeting, including
myself, wanted to see
the next item on the
agenda discussed; how-
ever, certainly expected
the meeting to be clos-
ed, as indicated in the
Union's Standing Ord-
ers. I was surprised that
Mr. Wadsworth ignored
the challenge; when it
was pointed out to him
that he must observe the
standing orders and
close the meeting which
was clearly inquorate, he
said "I do not hear the
challenge".
Mr. Lolley began to
use a loudhailer to call
quorum.
2.14 Mr. Sayles, in the
chair, called for a propo-
ser to the motion in
question. Mr. Lynch
rose, and said approxi-
mately three sentences.
Mr. Sayles also ignor-
ed Mr. Lolley's chal-
lenge.
2.15 Mr. Sayles called
for a speaker to move
the amendment. I rose
and proceeded to the
microphone. Before I be-
gan to speak, Mr. Bart-
ley moved standing or-
der 20 i), "that the ques-
tion now be put". Con-
stitutionally Mr. Sayles
was not bound to accept
this.
He did, however, and
with Mr. Lolley still call-
ing quorum, asked for a
vote. It was not clear
whether Mr. Bartley
wished the amendment
or the original motion to
be voted upon. While
this was being cleared
up, Mr. Lolley gave up
in disgust, and Mr. East
took over from him. Mr.
East prevailed where Mr.
Lolley had not and the
meeting was closed.
Two issues arise here.
Firstly both chairmen
blatantly ignored the
standing orders in not
closing the meeting. Is it
any wonder that a can-
didate in the recent IC
election called for a
more rigid application of
standing orders.
Secondly, this lapse
could hardly have been
made in the interest of
the discussion. Other-
wise, why did Mr. Say-
les accept a procedural
motion, which effective-
ly would have meant no
debate?
As I understand it,
Mr. Bartley wanted to
vote on the original mo-
tion immediately, and
not debate or vote on the
amendment. Clearly, at
2.15, he could not have
been worried about the
time factor.
I would suggest that
since Mr. Bartley was
opposed to my position
on the issue, he attempt-
ed to prevent me from
putting forward my point
of view. To quote a
prominent member of
the Union "Maybe he
didn't want to hear what
you wanted to say". Mr.
Bartley himself claimed
that the situation was
quite clear: "the social-
ists" (whoever they are)
were trying to stop
people they didn't like
from speaking. There-
fore, he claimed, there
was no reason for me to
say anything.
Who, I ask, is trying
to stop free speech?
Trev Phillips, Chem 3.
from D. M . Brown
and P. R. Lynch
Sir,
We feel we must pro-
test about some of the
occurrences at the last
Union Meeting. Trev
Phillips' amendment to
the 'Free Speech' motion
removed sanctions all
dealing with this top-
ic turning it into a mo-
tion on racialism and at-
tempting to prevent dis-
cussion of the original
issue. Further, Mr. Phil-
lips' suggestion that the
President-elect (who, co-
incidentally is also call-
ed Trev Phillips) pro-
duces his own personal
report to the Union is
unthinkable: Why should
he become a one-man
racialism committee?
One man does not make
a discussion?
In short, Mr. Phillips
should propose his own
racialism motion, not
amend someone else's
on a totally different
topic.
However, this is not
just a piece of idle Trev-
bashing. Trev stood for
election under a free
democratic system: ev-
eryone had their say, no-
one was suppressed, and
Trev got elected (news!
news!).
If he has been elected
under this system, he
is under a moral obliga-
tion to abide by it, or he
becomes a dishonest in-
credible candidate. If it.
was his intention to sup-
port the suppression of
freedom of speech, he
should have stated so in
his campaign.
The system has been
abused. The only way for
people to remove these
abuses is for more
people to attend Union
Meetings. Democracy
only works when targe
numbers of people are
interested. If more
people attended Union
meetings, there would be
no more quorum challen-
ges and democracy
would be preserved.
A Union Meeting is
meant to.be representa-
tive of the Union, and as
such can never be repre-
sentative with a small
number of people pres-
ent, or if one half of the
Union is actively sup-
pressed.
D. M . BROWN
P. R. LYNCH
(Publicity Department,
I.C.
Conservative Society)
from J . East
Sir,
As a result of the
criticism I have receiv-
ed, I will explain why I
called 'quorum' at the
last Union Meeting.
A motion which would
decide whether Racists
and Fascists would be
able to peddle their re-
actionary theories was
being debated, those
who said they should
had spoken and Mr. Phil-
lips stood up to propose
an amendment. At this,
someone suggested we
vote on the motion then.
The chairman accepted
this proposal (which he
need not do) and there-
fore we were deciding
on this most important
issue without even hear-
ing why Racists and Fas-
cists should have 'no
platform in the colleges.
Is this the democracy
Conservative Society
and the Executive want?
J I trust Mr. Phillips will
deal with some of the
other points, I would like
to explain why we say
"No platform for Racists
and Fascists".
j We have heard of the
'scientific' theories of
such as Eisiinle and Hun-
tington, who maintain
that Anglo-Saxons are
the master-race (even
Scots, Welsh and Irish
are inferior) but what of
groups such as the Fas-
cist National Front, who
have harrassed immi-
grants, under the guise
of looking for 'illegal'
ones. The law has given
them a licence to spread
their racist propaganda,
and they seem to be im-
mune from the Race-Re-
lations act. It is only by
denying them a platform,
that the spread of their
theories can be halted,
along with an explana-
tion of the dangers of
racism ot those who rac-
ists are trying to influ-
ence. We do not need
racists to explain the
danger of racism, there-
fore there is no need to
let them 'condemn'
themselves.
The racist propaganda
has already been put to
good use among the
working class, where
White trade unionists
have on occasion 'scab-
bed' on black fellow
workers, and in the col-
leges where, for in-
stance, we have the over-
seas students committee
at IC proposing that all
foreigners take a course
in English at their own
expense before being ad-
mitted (this from a com-
mittee which is meant
to help overseas stud-
ents). Similarly the pro-
posal to increase fees
for overseas students to
£1500, is being used by
racists, who say it is a
privilege for 'wogs' to
study here,
I hope all students at
IC will welcome as I do,
the news that the Vice-
Chairman of that racist
rabble, the Monday Club,
was stopped from speak-
ing in Oxford last week,
and condemns the fact
that Consoc have invited
him here.
We should take note
of the people of the East
End of London who in
1930 refused Mosely a
platform, when he tried
teo march with his facist
bands through Cable
Street. 25,000 people
stopped them. But these
events are not all in the
past, the NF have march-
ed through Britain with
their racist filth, and
regularly stand in elec-
tions. WE M U S T REA-
LISE THAT FREE
SPEECH W O N T STOP
T H E M .
BAR STAFF
WAGES
from T. Francis
Dear Sir,
I would like to draw
your attention to the way
this college treats its
part-time bar staff.
The rate of pay is 48p
an hour and has been
for two years and on the
grounds of inflation
alone, an increase is in
order. For a session in
Southside or the Union
this means £2.40 (plus
a meal), for an evening
shift. Although this is
more than some pubs
pay, pub barmen merely
serve; they do not do
cellar work, glass col-
lecting and washing,
bottling up and the other
many tasks college part-
timers do as a matter of
course.
There are many occa-
sions when the bars are
open outside normal
hours. This is especially
true in College Block
Bar, which has been op-
en until 4 a.m. on occa-
sions. After the bar does
eventually shut it takes
about two hours to clear
up the mess. This means
part-timers may work un-
til 6 a.m. The system, as
it stands at the moment,
does not pay any form
of overtime, so one can
work fourteen hours
straight at 48p per hour.
It is also a fact that the
only way of getting
home after 1 a.m. is ef-
fectively by taxi. Taxi
fares are not reimbursed,
so a couple of hours pay
are lost just getting
home. Exploitation of
cheap student labour?
It may be stated by
the authorities that the
bar cannot afford to pay
a fairer wage. This is not
the case; the bars always
make a considerable pro-
fit, thousands of pounds
a year—note the recent
vast modernisation of
bar facilities.
I wrote this letter be-
cause I feel the system
to be unjust. I am quite
prepared to argue the
case with anyone (who
buys me a pint!)
Finally, I was glad to
hear the Rector has set
up a working party to ex-
amine how the college
can get more benefit
from outside people us-
ing the facilities here.
Yours faithfully
T. Francis
Reply from D. Sinclair
Sir,
Thank-you for allow-
ing me to comment on
this letter. I have discus-
sed the matter, briefly,
with Mr. Mooney and he
will write to your corres-
pondent in due course. I
can assure you that this
matter will be brought
before the Bar Commit-
tee, of which the Presi-
dent of the Union, Mr.
Norman Sayles, is a
member and the Deputy
President is Chairman. I
cannot give a complete
answer until after that
meeting to which, inci-
dentally, barmen have
been invited.
••'••i«rxsl uoy- gi
I would, however,
point out at this early
stage that, as your cor-
respondent states, we do
pay a better rate than
local pubs for our casual
labour. I would also
point out that the bars
are run for students to
drink in and, not, in the
first analysis, to provide
them with a means of
supplementing their in-
come, although many
students take advantage
of this opportunity and I
feel this is probably to
the benefit of most
people who drink in IC
bars. As regards work-
ing overtime, this is a
matter of negotiation be-
tween the barman and
the casual barman. The
normal practice is for a
barman to ask someone
if he would care to work
on a specified bar on a
specified night for a
specified wage. If the
casual barman does not
think it's worth his while
he refuses. Obviously,
late night extension bars
e.g. for College Block
dinners, are better suited
to people who live fin
Hall or near to College.
If you must get, and pay
through the nose for,* a
taxi home in the early
hours, after working all
evening, you must judge
whether, all things con-
sidered, it's worth it.
I would say again that
this is a personal opinion
and I have not had time
to consult the relevant
committee but this will
be done.
Yours sincerely,
D. Sinclair.
