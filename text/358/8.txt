GOLF
The boys pull off
the big one
It has been some time
since I last wrote about
the society. Because of
this it has been said that
the society has lain dor-
mant. This is not so.
Since then we have
added two more scalps
to our belt in the shape
of Thomas' Hospital and
Sussex. Alas, we have
also slipped to a defeat
against Kent as well.
Thus the league title that
we so earnestly sought
in the early part of the
season is now in the
hands of the enemy.
However, on Monday
6th May the society
achieved a goal far more
significant than merely
the league. On that day
we carried off the South
and East Universities
title for the first time in
IC's history. Indeed if
one looks through the
society archives one
finds that IC has never
been placed better than
third in the Champion-
ship, and that was ach-
ieved by the notorious
'47 side that also car-
ried off the league title.
It is in this historical
perspective that one
must judge this victory
and it seems that any
way you look at it the
achievements of the '73-
'74 boys are amongst
our greatest.
The Championship
was won in great style
by six shots, a margin
which left IC the easy
winners and everyone
else nowhere. However
this easy margin con-
ceals much of the strug-
gles that took place
during the course of the
competition. After the
first round in which the
IC lads had not played
up to their capabilities
we found ourselves two
shots off the lead. The
leaders, Southampton,
were in fine fettle over
lunch and started the
final round strongly. The
writing seemed to be on
the wall. However, the
turning point came when
Bill Calderwood and
Rich Brown attacked the
course in no uncertain
terms and with a burst of
birdies unprecedented
in the competition's his-
tory made the leader
board flash red so often
that many motorists
mistook it for traffic
lights. The lift this gave
the other lads cannot
properly be assessed,
but what can be said is
that the society inexor-
ably crept up on South-
ampton until, from the
29th hole onwards, the
tournament was clearly
to be ours.
Other points worthy of
mention is that Bill Cal-
derwood took the indivi-
dual title and Rich
Brown the best nett. A l l
in all it was an IC clean-
up and all the opposition
could take away with
them were a couple of
runners-up spoons.
The Championship
winners: Nigel Foster
(capt.), Bill Calderwood
(v.-capt.). Rich Brown,
John Medonca, Clive
Pemberton, Mick Carr.
ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROBLEMS
We do not doubt Ida's
good intentions but we
do have doubts about
her good sense and the
ability of her committee
which was made up pre-
dominantly if not totally
of British students who
we imagine have not
had much problem with
the English language
since the age of two
to understand the lan-
guage problems of over-
seas students and make
sensible suggestions to
overcome these prob-
lems. We agree with
Ida that a serious prob-
lem exists and that
something must be
done about it. Ida
blames the overseas
students for the situa-
tion and hence puts the
responsibility for solv-
ing it on the overseas
students. We believe
that the College is to be
blamed for this situation
and so responsible for
solving it. Let us just
see what brilliant pro-
posals Ida's committee,
after discussing the sub-
ject at length, intends
to make to the Board
of Studies. Firstly that
overseas s t u d e n t s
should take a compul-
sory English exam be-
fere entering the Col-
lege and that their ac-
ceptance should be
subject to passing this
exam. It is not clear
exactly how taking an
exam is going to solve
the problem. It will just
mean that those whose
problems we are trying
to solve will not be able
to come to the College.
Continued from Page 1
In a way this does solve
the problem but the
question is in whose in-
terest. Certainly not in
the interest of those who
suffer from it. We be-
lieve that any idea of a
compulsory exam is
totally unacceptable to
overseas students be-
cause it imposes yet an-
other discriminatory
measure against them
over and above the dis-
crimination that already
exists. We find it incre-
dible that a committee
which is supposed to
defend the interests of
overseas s t u d e n t s
should recommend a
measure to the College
that is totally against the
interests of overseas
students and would fur-
ther restrict the possi-
bilities for overseas stu-
dents to come and
study here. This especi-
ally at a time when the
government is intending
to impose further re-
strictions in the form of
increasing fees.
The second recom-
mendation for an Eng-
lish language course to
be made available dur-
ing the summer before
coming to the College is
a little more to the
point but it seems from
the recommendation
that the overseas stu-
dent is supposed to pay
for this. It is totally un-
acceptable that over-
seas students most of
whom do not get a grant
and who already pay
discriminatory f e e s
should also pay for this
language course. This
would be yet another
financial impediment to
them. Some of the
"other alternatives" sug-
gested are interesting.
One is that there should
be an English Language
'O' level entrance re-
quirement. According
to Ida the obvious dis-
advantage with this is
"in that such examina-
tions are not taken in a
number of countries".
Well if Ida had any clues
about the problem she
is trying to solve she
would realise that there
is an even more obvious
disadvantage. M o s t
overseas students from
countries where English
is not widely spoken
would probably not be
able to pass English 'O'
level when they have
even graduated from IC
never mind passing it
before they come to this
College.
There is only one way
in which this language
problem can be solved
in the interest of over-
seas students. The Col-
lege must provide a
FREE English language
course during the sum-
mer for new overseas
students and there
should be NO compul-
sory exams at the end
of this course. At the
same time some of the
rooms in the halls in-
stead of being used as
hotel rooms for summer
tourists should be made
available for these stu-
dents. In this way it will
be possible for the larg-
est possible number of
overseas students to
YHA CANOEING
OR "WYE WE DID ITr r
17.30: Friday the 26th April: our
intrepid band of heroes journeyed
forth into the setting sun to the distant
lands of the West Country, ably sup-
ported by an equally intrepid band of
heroes from Bedford College. This,
the climax of the Hostelling Year at
IC was to prove to be as memorable
and as strenuous a week-end as any
of the previous hiking trips, writes our
correspondent with sore and blistered
hands.
We stayed at the Welsh Bicknor
Youth Hostel, With Richard, Mike,
Laurence and Phil suffering the fate
of a four-man tent in the grounds of
the hostel. The hostel is to be re-
membered perhaps for the painfully
long journey to the men's washroom,
the Cagney impersonating warden,
and the surplus of lemon curd and
consequent lack of thick cut marma-
lade.
Saturday, we travelled some ten
miles upstream to our embarkation
point, hired our canoes and cast off
into the midge infested upper reaches
of the Wye. Navigating down to Ross,
we stopped to dry off in the nearest
pub, as some of our company had
already tasted the waters of the river,
and proceeded to make ourselves un-
popular with yet another landlord.
Further downstream, we passed the
impressive Goodrich Castle, where
the author and John "Guess my
middle name" Allen made a swift
reconaissance of the said antiquity.
Sunday saw us preparing, in our
still wet clothes and with diminished
enthusiasm, for the second half of the
voyage down to Monmouth, taking in
the well known beauty spot at Sym-
onds Yat and its accompanying rapids
which struck terror into the hearts of
such stalwarts as Margaret "I'm only
here for the brandy" Bassett. So hav-
ing stopped at " Y e Olde Ferrie Inn"
to pluck up courage (or was it Whit-
bread) for the descent, we shot the
said rapids which proved somewhat
pathetically anticlimactic, so much so
that a number of stalwarts dragged
their canoes up the bank to repeat
the performance, with Mr. Avison
going on for a third attempt, and
probably would have continued ad
infinitum (or nauseam), had time
permitted.
The occasion is to be remembered,
if only for Mr. Welford's gallant dem-
onstration of shooting the rapids with
neither canoe nor paddle, a feat to
go down in the Guinness Book of
Idiots. Congratulations are due to
Tom and Alison for their record-
breaking attempt to navigate the Wye
underwater and commiseration to
Martin who had to bail them out. A
special thanks to Malcolm Q for not
alluding to a certain factory in Slough,
more than was really necessary.
Noteâ€”ULU Y H A are arranging a
folk evening at Ivinghoe Y H and a
ramble in the wilds of Bedfordshire

ton at 10.00. PGC
SQUASH
On the whole, it has
been a good season for
the squash club. Of the
four teams in the Lon-
don Univ. League, IC 1
again won the 1st divi-
sion with IC 2 finishing
about half way down
the table of the same
division (10 teams in-
volved).
In the second divi-
sion, IC 3 finished very
near the bottom, indeed
only just escaping rele-
gation. This was partly
due to the No. 2 string,
G. Dickson, being ill for
most of the Spring and
being unable to play.
The 4th team did pretty
well in the 3rd division
and were unlucky in not
gaining promotion, fin-
ishing 3rd in the table.
The success of these
teams has, in a large
part, been due to the
regularity in which the
same players have
turned out for each
match, so enabling
strong teams to be
picked each week. I
thank all the players
concerned!
Unfortunately, in the
end of season knock-
out tournament, IC 1
were tragically beaten
3-1 in the Semi-final by
Guys Hospital, M . Keny-
on, the no. 1 string, be-
ing the only one to win.
I. Menzie had a good
match, eventually losing
3-1 but A. Khan and R.
Smith both seemed to
have off-nights and in-
stead of winning as was
expected, both disap-
pointingly lost 3-0.
I would like to say a
big thank-you to some
of the IC 1 and IC 2
players' wives who
provided us with food
after the home matches
â€”saving us from the
fate of the 'bouncing
Mooney sandwich' and
also to J. Lloydâ€”the
secretary and G. Dick-
son, the treasurer, who
both did conscientious
work for the club.
M. R. Kenyon,
(Captain ICSRC)
have a good enough
knowledge of English to
cope with their lectures
before they start their
course. Free English
classes should of
course c o n t i n u e
throughout the year and
these should be at
several different levels
to cater for the needs of
different students.
As far as the overseas
students committee is
concerned, the new
committee which was
elected last term and is
already taking over
from the previous one,
unlike the retiring one
is made up mostly of
overseas students and
as such we hope would
be able to distinguish
more clearly between
what is and what is not
in the interests of over-
seas students. The fact
that last term a group
of overseas students
stood for election for
this committee and
were elected is itself a
reflection of the grow-
ing concern among
overseas students about
their increasing prob-
lems, among which
language is only one,
and the inability of the
previous committee to
do anything about solv-
ing them as is clearly
demonstrated by their
confused approach to
the language problem.
The N U S Easter confer-
ence decided that a
campaign must be
launched to end dis-
crimination a g a i n s t
overseas students. It is
in the Colleges that this
campaign is going to
take place and we hope
that at IC the new over-
seas students commit-
tee will take an impor-
tant role in launching
this campaign. But it is
only with our full sup-
port that the committee
can do this. The Persian
Society will give the new
committee its active
support for as long as
this committee fights for
the interest of overseas
students. We urge all
other national societies
and individual students
to do the same.
