4 FELIX 14th May, 1974
EDITORIAL
Sunday press date is usually for two things:
(1) to check and re-distribute copy already set;
(2) , to fill the remaining gaps. Sometimes, as in
the last issue, this was not possible because of
the great excess of articles, etc.
Which brings me to my first point in this edi-
torial.
FELIX
The comments that were made recently about
Felix being controlled by the Executive is, as
Norman Sayles put it last week, bullshit. In fact,
the editorial that I wanted to print last issue had to
be scrapped due to lack of room. First priority
since I took over has been to print what YOU want
to read and to persuade people (such as society
chairmen) to provide this material. Second priority
has been to try and find room for ALL articles that
are handed to me, usually at the expense of any
space-fillers that I had produced. Third priority,
and one that I have rarely had a chance to use
because of the success of my first and second
priorities, has been for me to use Felix as an
opportunity to act as editor and make Editorial
comments. AND when I have been able to do
this it has been usually in the form of an Hon.
Ssc's piece and not personal comments. My over-
all comment to the IC communist party would
therefore be "Stick your comments about Felix
up your ass" (to be polite).
FREE SPEECH
The second part concerns the disputed NUS
racialism motion amendment on fascist speakers.
On this page I have tried to draw together all the
various factual items on this business referring to
happenings since last issue (see also letters page).
The news from City Univerity is good, that from
Oxford is bad. Mr. Phillips, president-elect, has
commented to me several times since conference
that the violence part of the amendment is but a
small part of it. He has also commented that it
would only be the International Socialists and
members of the International Marxist Group that
would actually use physical violence to break up
meetings. Fine rhetoric Trev but, with NUS policy
as decided at conference (and by a minority vote
remember) the violence at Oxford has the full
official backing of the NUS. If the same thing
happens at the meeting planned for IC next Mon-
day that too will have NUS's support. BUT does
it have your support. I know not. But you must
show it. The way to do this is to turn up to the
next UGM, to be held on Thursday, May 23rd, in
the Union Concert Hall. This is primarily to choose
a delegation for the emergency NUS conference
on grants on June 15th. This, however, as you
see from the City University news will also be
important because of the racialism discussion.
After delegation elections, there will be motions
If there are more than 300 present, the motion on
racialism and disruption of meetings will be dis
cussed, in the form of a right wing motion oppos-
ing the NUS amendment. If there are less than
300 the left and/or the piss artists will call
quorum, just as they did last week, and we will be
left with (a) no official policy of our own on this
important issue and (b) an inference that we sup
port the NUS view.
I THEREFORE CALL ON YOU TO COME OUT
EVEN IF IT'S FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR
AND THEN NEVER AGAIN, AND SHOW YOUR
OPPOSITION TO VIOLENCE.
NUS EXECUTIVE STATEMENT ON RACISM
CITY UNIV.
PEACE INITIATIVE
A campaign to remove
the now famed racialism
amendment from ithe
policy of the NUS has
been started by the City
University Student's
Union.
Quoting the following
from the United Nations
Universal Declaration of
Human Rights they hope
to gain enough support
from colleges to enable
the topic to be discussed
at the Emergency Con-
ference that has already
been organised for a
discussion on grants.
Article 19 — Every-
one has the right to
freedom of opinion and
expression; this right in-
cludes freedom to hold
opinion without interfer-
ence and to seek, receive
and impart information
and ideas through any
media and regardless of
frontiers.
Article 20 — Every-
one has the right to
freedom of peaceful
assembly and associa-
tion.
To enable the topic to
be discussed they need
the support of at least
ten colleges, and they
already have the sup-
port of five.
On Saturday, May
16th at the City Univer-
sity, St. John Street,
London EC1 they are
holding a meeting to dis-
cuss a motion to go to
Extraordinary Confer-
ence and other relevant
matters to this question.
Primarily this meeting
will be to discuss ways
of repealing the policy.
The NUS Easter Con-
ference passed an 8-
page motion condemn-
ing racism and the grow-
ing discrimination
against NUS's overseas
members. Press atten-
tion has focused on one
paragraph of one amend-
ment which was includ-
ed in that motion, the
paragraph in which Con-
ference determined to
deny a platform to or-
ganisations such as the
Monday Club and the
National Front.
We have to make clear
precisely what this in-
volves us, and our mem-
bers, in doing. Firstly,
emphatically, we are not
going to send round a
"heavy squad" to break
up meetings. Neither are
we going to try to re-
strict the activities of
the Conservative Party
among students. Con-
servative students have
the right to propagandise
among students like any
other political group. We
do not intend to infringe
that right in any way.
What we do intend to
do is to deny platforms
to the apostles of racial
hatred. If this is "limit-
ing freedom of speech"
then we plead guilty. But
we believe there is a
more important freedom
at stake: The freedom to
live without discrimina-
tion on the basis of race.
This is a part of one
of the major campaigns
students will be asked to
fight in the coming
months: against discrim-
ination, against racist
legislation, for the
strengthening of the race
relations act, and for a
multi-racial multi-cultur-
ral society.
The Right to Preach
Racial Hatred
Summing up on the
amendment at the Con-
ference, NUS National
Secretary Steve Parry
said that had we known
in advance what we
know now of Hitler's
Germany, we would
have wanted to temper
our concern for free
speech with our concern
for humanity, and to re-
fuse him a platform.
There can be very few
people who would dis-
agree with this. Those
who oppose our position
presumably believe that
there is no danger what-
soever of the Nazi type
of racial discrimination
here.
We believe this view
is dangerously complac-
ent. The most vicious
racial hatred is being de-
liberately fomented by
well organised extreme
right wing groups in this
country, some of them
in a position to influence
the Conservative Party.
The last Government
gave way to that section
of its supporters, in some
of its statements and
legislation, to a truly
horrifying extent. When
racists can influence
Government policy so
profoundly, then we can-
not afford acute pangs
of liberal conscience
about denying the racist
his right to hate in pub-
lic.
Racial Discrimination
be the Government
Lest anyone doubts
that racists have influen-
ced Government decis-
ions, we wish to outline
in particular the discrim-
ination practised against
VIOLENCE ERUPTS
Mr. Harold Soref,
deputy chairman of the
right-wing Monday Club,
was forced to abandon
a meeting at Oxford
Union last week. He had
been speaking for about
40 minutes and was con-
cluding his speech when
a group of students
forced their way through
the Union entrance.
Union officials had
attempted to barricade
the way with desks,
which were pushed
away, and by closing
doors, which were made
of glass and were
smashed by the mob.
The mob totalled about
25.
In the room where
the meeting was being
held, members barri-
caded the way with
chairs and benches
whilst Mr. Soref beat a
hasty retreat through a
rear door that had to be
broken open. During
the retreat to his car he
had to be helped over a
six foot high wall. There
was no physical violence
on Mr. Soref though this
is no doubt mainly due
to the fact that he was
no longer present in the
room when the mob
arrived.
Oxford police have
announced that arrests
have been made, with
one man being suspec-
ted of causing criminal
damage.
The fact that this
kind of violence now has
official NUS backing no
doubt encouraged people
to take part in this dis-
gusting behaviour (see
editorial).
Footnote: Oxford Uni-
versity student union is
in the red. Mr. Sullivan,
the president, has not
been paid for two weeks
and there are debts of
£1500. The lack of
money apparently arises
from the fact that only
two colleges had paid
their subscriptions.
the 10 per cent of our
membership who come
from overseas. This is
not racial hatred from a
few harmless, sick-mind-
ed individuals.This isra-
cial discrimination prac-
tised by the Government,
encouraged by the last
Government, and in
many cases, actually en-
shrined in the legislation
of this country.
(1) Overseas students'
tuition fees were raised
to over three times the
fees for home students
from about £80 p.a. to
about £250 p.a.
(2) Because Local Auth-
ities are not allowed to
subsidise their lodgings,
as they frequently do for
British students, over-
seas students pay up to
six times as much for
their accommodation.
(3) V A T was not impos-
ed on student hostels—
unless those hostels
were for students from
overseas.
,4) The 1971 Immigra-
tion Act ensures almost
completely that the only
way students can supple-
ment their income—by
vacation work—is bar-
red to students from
overseas.
(5) The 1971 Immigra-
tion Act decreed that
overseas students whose
activities were thought to
be "against the public
good" is one of those
umbrella phrases which
civil libertarians have al-
ways protested must
never be embodied in
law because it can be
interpreted any way you
like. Such a formulation
would never be tolerated
in legislation aimed at
our own citizens: why
should we accept it
peaceably because it ap-
plies only to foreigners?
In the case of deported
North London Polytech-
nic student Aristides
Mavroskoufis it was in-
terpreted to cover what
the authorities thought
he might possibly do on
the evidence of his poli-
tical activities in Greece.
(6) Tory Home Secre-
tary Robert Carr made
proposals in the House
of Commons on 6th De-
cember, 1973, which
would have the effect of
increasing the harrass-
ment of overseas stud-
ents. He proposed that
the Home Office would
monitor their progress
very carefully and re-
ceive regular reports
from their college auth-
orities; that the mini-
mum number of hours
per week they study
should be raised; and
that they should be pre-
vented from changing
their courses. His pro-
posals, if put into effect,
would mean that Univer-
sities and Colleges
would have to have two
sets of regulations; one
set for British students
and another more strin-
gent set for foreigners.
(7) Overseas postgrad-
uate students will have
to pay up to £1500 a
year tuition fees if the
recommendations of the
Parliamentary Expendi-
ture Committee earlier
this year are adopted.
This would ensure that
no overseas students
could do postgraduate
work in this country un-
less his parents were
very rich indeed.
NUS believes that
these measures are the
measures of a Govern-
ment influenced by rac-
ialists.
We have watched or-
ganised racism at work
in every level of our
society, including the
Government. We have
been powerless to stop
it. But we can stop rac-
ists from speaking in the
places where we work
and study and attacking
the basic democratic
rights of our members.
The High Priests of Race
Hatred
We have been told
that it is a denial of free
speech to stop members
and sympathisers of par-
ticular political groups
from speaking. Does this
mean that the NUS does
not believe in free
speech?
Our answer is no, it
means nothing of the
kind. But we believe
there are limitations on
the right of free speech.
The laws of libel and
slander are one example;
the race relations act is
another. The following
are the kinds of people
to whom we will refuse
a platform:
Enoch Powell: " . . .
wide-grinning picanin-
nies . . . who cannot
speak English" (Birming-
ham, 2 1 / 4 / 6 8 ) .
Air-Commodore Oddie:
of the National Front Na-
tional Council — " O f
course I am a racialist''
(Observer 3 0 / 3 / 6 9 ) .
John Tyndalh of the Na-
tional Front—"The Jew
is like a poisonous mag-
got feeding on a body
in a state of advanced
decay". (Sunday Times
3 0 / 3 / 6 9 ) — ' M e i n K a m f
is my doctrine" (Guard-
ion 8 / 2 / 6 4 ) .
Martin Webster: of the
National Front—"We
are busy forming a well-
oiled Nazi machine in
this country" (The Peop-
le 9 / 9 / 6 2 ) .
Frederick Stockwe! I: An
ex-chairman of the Mon-
day Club, who congratu-
lated Mr. Powell on
speaking about the
"threat to Britain's fut-
ure from the time-bomb
of a million or more un-
assimilable coloured im
migrants".
George Young: An ex-
chairman of the Monday
Club—"There is, and
will be widespread mis-
cegenation at the fring-
es . . . no one knows the
consequences" (Birm-
ingham 2 4 / 4 / 6 8 ) .
We do not see why we
should assist the propa-
gation of racism. We call
on all our members to
refuse these men plat-
forms.
