Bananas - Beautiful and Bendy
What's up with bananas then?
Well, apart from the obvious,
bananas are back on the politi-
cal agenda.
How come? Monkey man
Stuart Drummond has been
elected Mayor of Hartlepool.
Errr... what's the connection?
Stuart, the monkey mascot of
Hartlepool FC campaigned on a
ticket of free bananas for all
school children.
To promote good nutrition?
Yes, and as a reminder that the
good people of Hartlepool
lynched a monkey who they
thought was a French spy for
Napoleon.
Thank goodness we live in
more civilised times then! But
not if you are a banana grower.
What's the problem? There
are several. Small family pro-
ducers i n the Caribbean are
being squeezed out by large
scale plantation companies in
Central America
funded by
megabucks.

Fairly traded bananas usually
come from estates i n the
Caribbean where worker safety
is a high priority,
and family farms
which are strug-
gling with low
prices and compe-
tition from planta-
tions.
Coopetrabasur is a co-opera-
tive in Costa Rica, set up by for-
mer Chiquita workers when the
multinational pulled out 20
years ago. In just a few years,
Fairtrade has made a difference
to the co-op's 300 members and
workers. They have begun an
environmental programme,
reduced chemical use, and
started recycling all plastic
waste. Better prices have
allowed them to invest in hous-
ing and tree planting. The work-
ers are now paid 60% more than
the minimum

By choosing fair trade, w e
know that our purchase is help-
ing to provide decent liveli-
hoods for the people who grow
the ingredients or make the
products. Fair trade is not about
charity, it's about giving people
the dignity of working their way
out of poverty, providing oppor-
tunity and hope for the future.
It's about developing a different
way of buying things, whether
we're choosing coffee or cards,
tea or T-Shirts.
This coming week, 20-24th
May, the Chaplaincy is organis-
ing a Fair Trade Week on cam-

plantation work-
ers? Not often, as
wages are low, the work
involves pesticides, and there is
little investment i n social or
health amenities for workers'
families. Plus it increases
dependency on this single cash
crop.
OK point taken. But there
must be some good news? Yes,
monkey man Stuart has
stepped out of the ape suit and
wants to get stuck into issues
like investment to reduce youth
crime.
A n d for the banana growers?
Participation in the Fair Trade
Label has helped small produc-

tation workers in countries like
Costa Rica.
Don't say: "Yes, w e have no

more than material benefits.
Arturo Jimenez Gomez said: "I
thank God for the new system,
because it has resolved our
problems. Our dream is to be
free, to be looked on as human
beings, as people, not objects.
Even poor farmers are allowed
to dream."
So, what is Fairtrade?
Fairtrade is about better prices,
decent working conditions,
local sustainability, and fair
terms of trade for farmers and
workers i n the developing
world. By requiring companies
to pay above market prices,
Fairtrade addresses the injus-
tices of conventional trade,
which traditionally discrimi-
nates against the poorest,
weakest producers. It enables
