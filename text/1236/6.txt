Credit Where Due
Dear Felix,
Having read Felix issue 1135 I
notice on page 2 there is an
article about the Summer Ball
2002 band line up. In the mid-
dle of the article there is an
excellent photo of all the party
goers in Great Hall, and I won-
dered who the photographer
was, as it is not mentioned
anywhere? Could it be the
same person who took all the
amazing photos of the summer
ball, which can be found at
www.dramsoc.org?
Yours, thedramsocphotogra-

Israeli Response
Last month an Arab terrorist
went into a hotel in Israel and
massacred a group of 28 cele-
brating a festive dinner. Two
weeks ago another gunman
burst into a family home and
slaughtered a family of
four.including a five year old
who h i d under her bed but
was sought after and killed in
cold blood by the terrorist.
These people were murdered
simply because of their
Jewish religion. These mur-
derers feted as heroes by
Islamist fanatics including
unfortunately a member of IC
(Felix 2 M a y 2002),who has
been publicising his pilgrim-
age to the Headquarters of the
person responsible for citing
and orchestrating these despi-
cable acts. The fanatics
excuse for these atrocities is a
land dispute but the 150 mil-
lion Arabs fighting the 5 mil-
lion Israelis, from their 21
states, have lands 500 times
the size of Israel. A n d what do
they do i n these vast lands?
Millions of Iraqis sought asy-
lum in Europe from the perse-
cutions of Saddam Hussein.
Thousands of Algerians fled
The Islamist civil war which
claimed 100,000 civilian lives-
is that the fault of Israel? The
very existence of a Jewish
state in whatever borders is
considered a stain on Arab
honour. The Arab despots
mobilise their people to
destroy Israel to distract them
from their poverty and oppres-
sion while their leaders enjoy
better lives benefiting from
their oil wealth and vast rich
lands. Indeed your correspon-
dent need only have taken a
journey through the streets
and alleyways near college to
hear dozens of of such tales of
Arab oppression from the
many who have fled to the
safety of this country. The
British media joins in the dis-
tortion of truth and the chan-
nelling of hatred towards
Israel. Just consider the
amount of attention given to
the 2.7 million Palestinian
Arabs, ignoring the news of
what is going on in the many
Arab states whether in Sudan
or Algeria or Syria a n d
Lebanon. Does the media
decry the Syrian subjugation
and occupation of Lebanon?
A pet topic of the British
media is the plight of
Palestinian Arab refugees,
ignoring the responsibility of
Arafat and other Arab rulers
for that plight. Jenin, suppos-
edly a refugee "camp" w a s a
fortress rich i n weapons and
explosives, yet they say that
they do not have enough
money for food, while the
British taxpayer still continues
to finance the U N emergency
refugee agency (an emergency
that has lasted for 54 years
when 5 Arab states first
invaded Israel).
All of Israel is a refugee
camp- indeed half the popula-
tion are survivors of the
Holocaust. What is not
realised is that the other half
are former citizens of Arab
talk back
states. These Jewish refugees
lost everything in their ances-
tral homelands a n d their
ancient communities dating
back to biblical times were
eliminated in 1948. But the
Israelis, all of them refugees,
concentrated on building new
lives in Israel and developing
their country. The Palestinian
Arabs have been encouraged
by their rulers and elements
within the European Union to
act as a ticking time bomb
which threatens to be a seri-
ous hazard to world peace.
Perhaps your correspondent,
could have volunteered his
services as a "human shield" to
stand outside any Israeli nurs-
ery school or cafe or Pool Hall
to guard against such homi-
cide bombers - somehow
though I doubt it!

Chairman Imperial College
Jewish Society
On bank holiday Monday,
Imperial College Jewish
Society, along with around
55,000 other supporters from
different faiths a n d back-
grounds, attended the "Israel
Solidarity Rally" at Trafalgar
Square.
The rally was held under the
banner of "Yes to Peace & No
to Terror" and was intended as
a massive show of support to
the Israeli people who are hav-
ing to endure relentless, indis-
criminate and brutal terrorist
attacks over the past 19
months. The message w a s
simple: Israel has a n d will
always strive for peace with
its neighbours, but is not pre-
pared to tolerate daily attacks
on its citizens.
Present at the rally were
numerous M P ' s and MK's
(Members of the Israeli
Knesset), as well as leaders
from the Jewish and Christian
community. Most prominent
however w a s former Israeli
