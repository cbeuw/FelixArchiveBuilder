club active
Imperial athletes helped the
University of London
Athletics Club in a success-
ful bank holiday weekend at
the Bedford International
Athletics Stadium. Despite
only 4 Imperial athletes
being able to compete due to
exams (such as Scottish
Indoor Pentathlon Champion
James Lowery), they certain-
ly made their presence felt in
the team. Katherine Williams
put in a gutsy run in the
heats of the 400m to qualify
for the semi-finals. Captain
Simon Lewis and Derek Mak,
w i t h G B International
Decathlete John Heanley
(Holloway) and last years
B U S A H O m H C h a m p i o n
Richard Sear (KCL) managed
to help the 4 x 100m Relay
Team qualify for the final.
With John, being replaced by
Guido Guizzardi in the final,
w h o has a 10.5s personal
best, there were high hopes
of them cutting at least a
second off there qualifying
time of 45.1s. However, in the
final, an unfortunate mix up
b e t w e e n Guido and Derek
meant the baton w a s not
changed in time and the
team was disqualified.
A superb sprint double from
E m i l y Freeman (UCL) w a s
the highlight of the weekend.
Her wins in the 100m and
200m maintain University of
London's record of having a
B U S A champion in the last 4
competitions (2 indoor and 2
outdoors).
From the word go Emily was
impressive, winning her heat
and semi-finals in impressive
time whilst easing d o w n at
the finish. Having been beat-
en in the 60m at the indoor
championships earlier on in
the season by a 100th of a
second, Emily was intent on
beating Kelly Thomas of
Loughborough. Whilst Emily
Outdoor
w a s easing through her
heats, Kelly had to work hard
to run similar times. In the
final, both w o m e n were
drawn in the 2 middle lanes,
and despite being very nerv-
ous before the start, Emily
manage to romp home in 1st
place in a time of 11.79s,
leaving Kelly 2nd in 11.96s.
The w i n in the 100m seemed
to set her up for her better
event, the 200m. With runs of
24.01s and 24.03s in the
heats, it seemed Susan
William's hand timed
Championship Record of
23.8s was under threat. The
most notable fact of all was
the way she stormed away in
her semi-final to w i n over a
second ahead of arch rival
Kelly Thomas. Drawn in lane
4 in the final, Emily w o n by
over seven tenths of a second
in 24.14s. Only head w i n of
1.3m/s prevented her from
taking the record.
Other noticeable performanc-
es of the weekend were from
Gordon Irvine (SGHMS),
A n d r e w Hennessy (UCL),
Richard Sear and John
Heanley. Gordon Irvine had a
solid run in the 10K final to
finish 12th. Former
Sportsman of the Year,
A n d r e w Hennessy tried des-
perately to w i n the title in
the 3000m steeplechase that
has eluded him. If medals
were awarded for guts and
bravery, this man would have
them all. After strolling
through qualification in 4th
place, in a time of 9mins 34.9
sees (a minute slower than
his personal best), A n d y
looked set to dominate the
final. However, due to study-
ing for his finals of his med-
ical degree he has had to cut
down training from 7 to 3
times a weeks. This lack of
fitness showed in the final.
With 4 laps to go, A n d y took
Athletics
the race by the horns and
took the lead. By the final lap
he had opened up a 10m
lead, but w i t h 250m to go he
w a s struggling and 2
Loughborough athletes over-
took and finished in front of
him. A n d y looked shattered
at the end of the race and
promptly threw up. If the
race was last year he would
have easily w o n it, but its
seems it came a year too late.
In the 110m Hurdles, defend-
ing champion Richard Sear
was unfortunate not to w i n it
again this year. After twist-
ing his ankle whilst dipping
for the line in the 1st round of
the 100m, there was a fear
that he could be out for the
hurdles. However, w i t h a bit
of physio, strapping and
ibuprofen, Richard was able
to qualify and line up for the
final. Unluckily, Richard
started terribly in the final
and only finished 4th in a
time of 14.9s behind 3 other
runners who all ran 14.5s.
GB International decathlete
and former B U S A indoor long
jump champion John
Heanley qualified for both
the H i g h J u m p and L o n g
Jump final, but due to exam
commitments, was unable to
compete in those finals los-
ing valuable team points.
Overall, w i t h key athletes
missing, University of
L o n d o n performed w e l l at
the championships consider-
ing w e do not have the
resources as the likes of
Loughborough, Bath, Brunei
and UWIC. Hopefully we can
continue our championship
successful in the future.
