For many years, members of
the Imperial Judo Club have
been fighting along side stu-
dents from other London
Colleges i n what constitutes
the University of London
Union judo team. A n d for
many years w e have been
privileged to reap the titles
and awards that have come
from this fruitful partnership.
Two years ago at the B U S A
championships s a w London
taking the gold in the team
title and last year w e secured
the bronze. This year w a s no
exception as it proved lucra-
tive i n the individual titles.
But first I must here give
mention a n d thanks to Mr.
Joe Dougherty a w i d e l y
respected w o r l d champion
who selflessly devotes his
time to training a n d to Sadia
Ndako w h o captained the
team and organised the trip.
The competition took place
at the National A r e n a i n
Birmingham over t w o days
on the weekend before the
Easter Holiday. O n the
Saturday the Individual
championships were run and
it w a s here that the medals
were attained. There w a s a
spread of weights across the
categories as team members
starved themselves, sauteed
in the sauna and even stood
on their heads to make the
weight. (More on this later).
In the Under 81kg Men's,
Mark Cox, a renaissance man
of sorts, took the silver. More
at home on the Rugby pitch,
in t w o years Cox moved from
novice to a level where he
took the second highest
accolade i n his field. In the
O P E N ( + 100 kg) category,
James Walker, recently hon-
oured w i t h colours for his
performance on last year's
team, took silver as w e l l .
Sadia Ndako w h o is a mere
ten points from her black belt
was awarded bronze in the
women's category. Daniel
Harvey takes the medal for
most stamina w h i l e Scott
Prosser the IC captain with
full colours fought admirably
taking some wins during the
day. In an upset, Julie
Morgan w a s denied a chance
at medalling, as she w a s the
only one i n her lightweight
division. Unintentionally or
otherwise, she drew blood
from the higher graded oppo-
nent she eventually fought.
Literally.
In the team event on the
second day w e advanced
several rounds before being
defeated just outside the
medal rounds. Of note w a s
Christopher Chang's
indomitable style of fighting
whereby he lures his oppo-
nent w i t h outstretched arms
reminiscent of Boris Karloffs
Frankenstein! It w a s both
highly entertaining a n d
effective as victory w a s swift
and decisive! But the biggest
laugh of the weekend came
from Mark Cox, who, 1 k g
overweight a n d holding up
the proceedings, took the
advice that he should stand
on his head to shed the
excess. So, wearing only a
smile, he assumed the posi-
tion for 1 minute before jump-
ing immediately on to the
scales. It worked. I believe
that is one for the physicists
to solve.
But b y far the greatest
spectacle occurred w h e n
British O l y m p i a n medallist
Kate Howey took to the mat.
A rewarding experience
w h i c h her hapless opponents
or w e shall never forget.
In drawing to a close there
are just a few points I would
like to pull on i n order to
encapsulate one of this writ-
ers o w n opinions. In recent
times there have been moves
by the administration to "re-
brand" or "remarket" the
image of The College follow-
ing dropping application lev-
els and the like. But I propose
that the image needs first to
be defined and marketed to
those here now. That the col-
lege is and is seen to be a top
class institution is without
doubt. Just cast a glance at
the departmental academic
ratings. But this body is only
skeletal. Time and time again
in popularity ratings (as in
the results released last
week) or social ratings w e
fall continually short. A n d it
is this that makes us unat-
tractive. What the College
needs is to be filled out w i t h
the meat of a culture. A fat
body of tradition fed b y the
achievement of clubs a n d
societies a n d the experi-
ences a n d ceremonies their
members hold dear. H o w
many know of the Colours
awards for instance? More
advertising. Imagine the
crowds that would go to see
the movie Kate Howey vs.
Frankenstein. A n d do not for-
get, where it took Newton
years over at Cambridge to
formulate his Principae, our
o w n Cox'y boy broke 'em i n
one minute. Such is the stuff
of legend.
