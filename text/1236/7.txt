back talk
Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu. He explained that
the Palestinian leader, Yasser
Arafat has himself, been
directly responsible for the ter-
rorist attacks. Furthermore he
has incited such hatred of
Israel in his people that peace
now seems more distant than
ever. The word 'Peace1 1
in
Palestinian society has
become a metaphor, for "push-
ing the Jews into the
Mediterranean Sea."
Netanyahu was cheered and
applauded w h e n he pro-
claimed that the only way to
peace is not VIA Arafat, but
rather OVER Arafat. He has
failed the Israelis as a partner
for peace but more important-
ly has failed his own people, in
their legitimate desire for a
state.
Most people would agree
that the Palestinians have the
right, like all nations, to self-
determination. Sadly they
chose to embark on a path of
violence and terror, in order to
achieve their goals, and this is
unacceptable. Negotiations
cannot resume whilst the
Israelis have a gun to their
head and suicide bombers are
exploding all over the country.
In a recent visit to Israel I
was witness to the daily rou-
tine of fear and insecurity to
which the Israeli people have
become accustomed. Not
being able to go to a coffee
shop, a supermarket, in fact
anywhere out of their homes,
without the fear of being
blown to bits. No country in
the world would be expected
to put up with such a state of
affairs. It is therefore Israel's
right and necessity to defend
itself, as any country would in
its position.
It angers me to read of the
so called "Peace Activists," like
the one who wrote into Felix
last week, that try to prevent
the Israeli army from complet-
ing its legitimate task of root-
ing out terrorists and destroy-
ing their infrastructure, whilst
still managing to maintain the
highest moral standards and
dignity of the innocent popu-
lous. It may interest readers to
know that many of these
activists have recently shel-
tered and some media person-
nel have even smuggled out
(knowingly or not) wanted ter-
rorists from refugee camps
and into Israel. Ambulances
were stopped and searched
because rather than ferry the
sick and injured, they were
used to move gunmen and
explosives. Most shocking of
all was the fact that women
would sometimes hide explo-
sives under their dresses and
pretend that they are preg-
nant, in an attempt to get
quickly across the Israeli
checkpoints.
The reality is that the
actions of the Palestinians and
their leadership at this time,
are not those of a people that
desire peace and an immedi-
ate end to violence. To negoti-
ate with and make conces-
sions at a time when young
people are still being mur-
dered on a night out in a club,
would be foolish and absurd.

Please No More...
Andy, Andy, Andy, when will
you learn? Personal attacks
never work.
You see I, too, could be per-
sonal. I could mention your IC
career, both as a medical stu-
dent and as an officer. But that
would be unkind. A n d I know
how upset you'd get.
So, let's keep the argument
on the topic shall we? The
NUS, you remember? This was
where you lied. You lied to the
clubs. You lied to the societies.
You lied to the drinkers in the
Bars and you are lying to your-
self if you believe the National
Union wouldn't represent your
views. You even lied to your
own campaign team for God's
sake! You took two weeks off
training to become a doctor, as
opposed to my single week.
A n d then there was what your
team actually told the stu-
dents when they stopped
them, which, quite frankly,
defies belief.
Anyway, enough of this. If
you believe what you hear,
there is a campaign brewing;
something along the lines of
"BONUS" (Bring On NUS) to
which I suspect you'll respond
something equally witty
(ANUS perhaps? Anti NUS?).
Still, it's been emotional. Can't
wait to hear your response, all
my love and gratitude for high-
lighting the antiquated opin-
ions that dogged your cam-
paign,
David Francis
Chair, ICU Campaign for Re-
affiliation to the NUS
