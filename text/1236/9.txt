Actually Mondays are

the worst. Now is a...

Da Vinci's, Evening
Wednesday Wotsits
As opposed to Tuesday
wotsits, which come in a
bag. Frankly if I need to
explain wotsits to you,
the chances of you going
are pretty slim.

Karaoke
Now I've warned you
about this, but there's
the possibility of some
American totty, so get
over there before they
learn to hold their drink.
Da Vinci's, 8:30pm
Molly Dixtures
Just for a change. I don't
know: I should have
done this row first, but I
did it last, and I just
want to go to bed. I'm
off for lunch with mum.

Raymond Luxury-Yacht
Help! I A m A Fish
What a good name. In
France it was 'Gloup, Je
suis un poisson', which
amused me. It's been
out for ages, but frankly
who cares with a name
as funky as that.
Slackers

Pie kids get up to some
hilariously post-adoles-
cent humour, and some-
one probably gets
caught with his genitals
in a goat or something.
Blade II
Have I mentioned that
this must be one of the
best films ever. Apart
from having Wesley
Snipes in, it's about
vampires. Who can ask
for anything more?
Mulholland Drive
This is actually on today
at the ICU Cinema. I
don't know exactly how
much it is, but I know
it's significantly cheaper
than Leicester Square.
Union Concert Hall, 7pm

Docu-drama about the
Felix office around
Tuesday night and

have no hair left to tear
out, you shouldn't laugh.

Beverly Night
Erm, I know I should
know this. I think she
sings R'n'B-ish stuff.
Look, if you're going to
go to a concert, I'm sure
you know what it is...
Shepherds Bush Empire
Catheters
Guffaw. Not a pretty
name, so almost certain-
ly a heavy rock band. I'm
so shallow, perhaps
they're a quartet of harp
playing gypsies. Or not.
Monarch
M a d Capsule Markets
On at ooloo, so probably
quite cheap and cheer-
ful. Maybe they're really
famous, and I'm just
being ignorant. More
likely, in retrospect.
ULU
Danko Jones
Erm, yeah. From the
website, I can see that
the lead guitarist, singer
chap (possibly Danko
himself) wears a very
silly hat. Possibly avoid?
Garage
Actual Size
They have very large
guitars, and positively
huge amps, so we all
know what that means.
You don't? Hint: it's the
same with cars. A h yes.
