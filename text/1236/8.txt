this week
Editorial
Hey there kiddies! How's you
all doin'? I'm having a small
nervous breakdown in the cor-
ner over here, due to the reve-
lation that I'm even more dis-
organised, and perhaps
unlucky, than I had ever
dreamed possible.
Literally minutes after send-
ing off my editorial to the
printers last week, I received
some more fascinating news,
and while it is still pertinent,
it is no longer causing me
quite the trauma it was, so I
won't bother ranting about it.
However, at that point I made
the fatal error of assuming
that things couldn't, physical-
ly, become any worse.
How foolish to overlook that
which can cause the most
pain. Affairs of the heart are
all well and good, if you've got
the time, but I have just today
been introduced to a far worse
and more deadly strain of
stress. Or stress of strain, per-
haps.
I'm going to Holland next
week, which I must agree will
probably turn out to be a very
pleasant experience, but this
does mean I have two issues
of Felix to create by next
Monday. This wouldn't be so
bad were it not for the added
bonus of the Alternative
Prospectus, w h i c h I have
recently been informed is 'Top
Priority'.
Now I'm slightly miffed
about this, because it wasn't
actually meant to be my job,
but here I am lumbered with it
anyway, since some muppet
(you know w h o you are)
decided he couldn't be arsed
to get on and do it himself.
Okay, so he's got a degree to
do, or some equally dull
excuse, but I'm allowed to get
grumpy occasionally, eh?
So there's that, not to men-
tion the fact that I have to
have the budgeting and 'gen-
eral plan' for the next hand-
book sorted out in the next
two weeks as well (remember
I'm not here next week), so all
in all I have a lot to do in the
next seven days.
A n d then I'm going to go
and represent the Union in
Delft, Holland, and hopefully
(when I'm not representing)
take some serious R&R, and I
know you know what that
means.
So that's the good news,
and as such it has also given
me something to write about
in my editorial, which is
always a bonus.
A n d who knows, if I insist
on looking on the bright side,
which seems to be my only
alternative to an aneurysm,
then I could see this as a valu-
able learning experience that
will enable me to manage
stress in a positive and con-
structive way. Or I could just
go down the boozer and get
completely trollied, which
would seem to be a far more
attractive prospect, all things
considered.
A n d just in case you were
interested, w h i c h I know
you're not, but I still have
space to fill, so here it is, I
have now been entirely drug
free for a week. That includes
alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, and
all illegal drugs, but not, I'm
afraid I have to admit, choco-
late. By the time you read this,
however, I will have probably
resumed my alcoholic ways,
and will be in the bar trying to
forget that I have done none of
the things that I intended to
do before I went away.
As my mother always says,
A stitch in time saves nine',
but as I always say 'Get your
bitch arse back in the kitchen,
and make me some pie!', so
that sorts that out...
