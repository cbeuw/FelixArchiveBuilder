coffee break
Crossword by Mummy Huffwell
Good evening. Due to an hilarious incident involving a bunch of keys,
eighty pounds of tofu and a bath sponge, Dr Hot Fudge is unable to pres-
ent the latest offering from Mummy Huffwell.
In case you're wondering, the bunch of keys were those very imple-
ments designed to give the good Doctor access to the Felix computers.
The involvement of the bath sponge should be obvious to anyone, of
course. It is, however, the tofu which may need some introduction. A s
vegetable products go, tofu is relatively innocuous. It has a very amiable
personality, but you must never taunt a live tofu. Doctor Fudge, unaware
of a dark streak deep in the sole of even the tamest tofu, teased the poor
thing mercilessly whilst it lay quite contentedly basking in the sun.
Well, that was that for the good Doctor. He's very lucky, one might say,
for having survived such a vicious attack. Most people perish at the
grappling claws of a roused tofu - very few escape from such a mauling.
However, Doctor Hot Fudge will be back at the reigns before too long,
though I've heard he has become a vegetarian on vindictive grounds.
