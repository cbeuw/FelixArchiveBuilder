Brownie Points
Why do so many people assume that students
only stand for jobs within the Union because it
gets them something to put on their C V ?
Granted, there are people who stand for that
reason, but you could put almost anything on
your C V and get away with it. How many
companies can really be bothered to check up
whether or not you were the chairman of this
club or treasurer of that society? I doubt that
many do.
If someone stands for a post purely for C V
points, they are unlikely to be wholeheartedly
devoted to the job; they won't give the job all
they can. Plenty of people involved in the Union
at the moment care about what they are doing -
the amount of time they spend doing it shows
that they are doing it for more than just the
credibility it gives to their job applications. This
may earn them the title 'hack', but it is these
people that keep the Union running.
Unfortunately, a lot of the time this hard work
goes unnoticed and no-one appreciates what they
do. It's all behind the scenes; they aren't in the
public eye as much as the sabbaticals, and they
certainly don't get paid for their work.
The sabbatical candidates for these imminent
elections may be standing as a career move, or
they may be standing because they genuinely
care about the Union and want to do a good job.
Unfortunately, you won't know their true
intentions until next year when they will have
begun their 'term of office'. You'll just have to
trust them that they'll keep their manifesto
promises. Don't forget, you can ask them all
sorts of awkward questions at the hustings next
week to try and find out their true worth. Go on,
make them squirm!
Downpour
As Jon Jordan said in the other letter on the
opposite page, "It never rains, but it pours", and
never has this been truer in the Felix Office than
this week. Almost every piece of machinery here
has broken down in some way. Normally it'll be
a bit annoying, but this week it has been

downright infuriating. Every piece of equipment
is temperamental and has its quirks, but the bits
and pieces in the Print Unit seem to be getting
more and more unpredictable as the months go
on. I do wonder if pieces of machinery are
somehow linked to each other - when one goes
wrong, they all go wrong. Who knows, but
whatever happens, it always means more work
for everyone. I just want to say a big thank you
to everyone who has helped out this week and
especially to everyone who collated well into the
night on Thursday.
