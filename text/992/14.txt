Sabbatical Election Manifestoes
President: Kamran Bashir Proposed by: Naresh Mistry
Say yes to Kamran Bashir on
election day.
Why?
* Student Representative Council -
The way forward. As widely
regarded, this policy is long
overdue and has received a great
deal of attention from all interests in
the college. I believe this is a
crucial issue and will ensure collab-
oration from all parties in carrying
this policy through.
* Preservation of St Mary's as a
distinct yet unique institution
within the auspices of the college -
It is of paramount importance that
St Mary's students feel that they
belong to the college yet their indi-
viduality should not be infringed. I
As president I believe that it would
be my job to run the Union smoothly
and efficiently. I have therefore
drawn up a set of ten promises I
have discussed with people whose
co-operation is necessary for these
to be put into practice.
1. The Government will bring in
student reforms. I believe students
should be kept informed about its
progress and effect. I will not only
keep you informed, but ensure
funding secured for all Union
activities.
2. There are plans to expand
Heathrow in the near future,
meaning the loss to IC of Harlington
sports ground. I will start negoti-
I am a final year mathematician and
I'm standing for President simply
because I want to do the job and
think I would do it well. I'm afraid I
must admit to having been heavily
involved with the Union for a while
now. I'm not going to insult your
intelligence with unrealistic
promises (eg cheaper beer).
However here are some of the
things I would like to sort out if you
elect me.
The union doesn't communicate
at all well. I would do my best to
improve this, for example, by
resurrecting the "Reaching Out"
find offensive the current proposals
to open Wilson House to all college
students because this would be of
great inconvenience to current
residents as they have a more rigor-
ous academic program to cope with.
* Making U L U work for us -
Integration not segregation. I am of
the opinion that some of the finest
events in London are held in
Imperial College. It is important to
market these events in a more
effective manner making events at
Imperial more accessible to
University of London students, thus
further enriching our environment.
Background
I bring with me a breadth of experi-
ence having previously:
ations now to protect Harlington.
3. At present ICU/Constituent
College relations are polarised,
mainly due to a lack of communica-
tion. I will introduce a memo of
understanding between the four
colleges and ICU setting out areas
of responsibility and interests of each
side so that all can work together.
4. A U G M will be held once a term
to ratify the decisions taken by a
new representative council.
5. I will improve postgraduate
working facilities.
6. The Union pays 40p to NatWest
for each cheque cashed. I believe
ICU should be brought into line
with other student unions and insist
stalls that were so effective at the
end of last year. Also I would like
to investigate further a student
employment bureau as was
promised a while ago. Three
hundred words isn't much, so
please read my fliers for more
information. Here's Chris:
It is uncommon for a proposer to
make election promises, but I will
promise that Paul is right for the job
of I.C.Union President.
When I finished as President last
year, I made up my mind not to get
involved in Union politics and I
haven't until now. I feel Paul's
* been elected treasurer and
chairperson of the parachute club.
* actively participated in the
decision making in the recreational
clubs committee.
* successfully completed two
academic sessions
* resided in intercollegiate hall thus
experiencing many social venues
attached to the University of
London.
* run a club night in various venues
around London.
Finally
I will ensure that you receive
impressive representation which is
effective and strong.
Remember. If anyone can Kamran
can, Cheers.
on an account with no bank charges.
7. It is difficult for any group other
than Ents to arrange an event. I will
set up a complementary board to
advise and help organise any
student event.
8. The Union paid for the refur-
bishment of the Sports Centre, but
the Sports Centre is run by College,
forcing clubs and societies to pay
large amounts for its use. I believe
the sports centre should benefit IC
students, not subsidise Kensington
residents.
9. I will promote a college-wide
second hand book shop.
10. As president I will be fully
accountable.
commitment to the tasks he under-
takes is exactly what the Union, as a
whole, needs. This belief has led me
to give as much support to his
campaign as 1 can.
I have known Paul as a fellow
Executive member and as a friend
and can honestly say that I have
found his help in difficult times, his
dedication and his support second
to none. I cannot say that Paul is
perfect and will always make the
right decision. I do know that we
need a Union President and that
Paul's sense and commitment will
make him a damn good one.
