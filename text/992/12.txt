Sabbatical Election Manifestoes
Deputy President (Finance & Services): Tim Brown Proposed by: JK Fouzder
As a famous comic said, unions are
like onions; both make you cry after
ten minutes. The Union's finances
aren't desperately interesting; I
don't believe that anyone can make
them so. I intend to make this
particular aspect of the Union run a
lot smoother than it has done, so
that everyone can worry about more
important things.
Clubs and societies have individ-
ual financial identities. I would give
the people who know best, ie. chair-
people and treasurers, as much of a
say as possible in how they're run.
A major problem I would like to
solve is the Union's financial rela-
tionship with Constituent College
Unions (City & Guilds, Mines and
RCSU), which are responsible for
departmental societies. Whether
they wish to devolve financially
from the Union and get funding
direct from College or remain with
the current (or a revised) financial
structure, I'd back them unequiv-
ocally. CCUs, just like St Mary's,
are able to look after themselves
and should be allowed to do so.
The Union Finance Committee,
which manages Union money,
should comprise of sub-committees,
which would contain everyone
interested in particular decisions (eg
I'd agree society matters with
appropriate representatives) and
which would report to the full UFC.
I feel my job would be to agree
policy with everyone involved in
Union finances and to help and
advise anyone who has to imple-
ment that policy to do so. If the
Union is to move its account away
from NatWest, due to excessive
bank charges, then I'd negotiate the
best deal possible.
My own Union 'record', which
includes one year as a society
treasurer followed by two as junior
treasurer to all the political, reli-
gious and miscellaneous societies,
should make me the best candidate
for this job (yes, folks, we're on our
way to Cliche City).
Deputy President (Finance & Services): Dan Look Proposed by: Greg lies
I am a third year geologist and, in
the past three years I have been an
active member of ICRadio
including regularly doing the disco
at Southside bar on Friday nights.
At present I am the Honorary Junior
Treasurer for the Publications
Board which has allowed me a
baptism into the mysterious world
that is union finance.
A question often asked to
candidates by fellow students is
"Why do you want to do that ????",
often with the insertion of one or
more expletives mid-sentence. The
sad truth of the matter is that union
finances genuinely interest me (I've
tried to deny it to myself, but to no
avail!)
Aside from that I see this
position in two ways; Firstly as a
chance to make a positive difference
in the running of the union and
secondly as a personal challenge to
myself.
If I am elected the most
important thing that I would try to
ensure is an increase in openness by
the union. I personally find it
frightening that this year the union
received a grant just short of 1/2
million pounds, yet how many of us
know how it was actually spent?
The other major problem I see
with the union at present is the
apathy of many of its members. I do
not propose any miracle cure for
this, but I would try to use my
position as a member of the ICU
exec, to improve this situation to
the best of my ability. I realise that
in order to get more people
involved with the union it may be
necessary to change it so as to
accommodate more of the student's
needs as well as promoting its
current services better.
Unfortunately I do not have the
space to expand on these points and
other issues, however, I am
(cut at the 300th word)
All Posts: New Election
Every year, people at IC vote, not
because they really want to vote for
a particular sabbatical candidate,
but because they feel they really
ought to be voting for someone.
They also assume (for some
stupid reason) that, just because a
candidate wants to stand, it means
they'd be good at the job. (This, of
course, isn't true; for any sabbatical
post you must have the right
qualifications and experience, just
like for any job - it's not enough
just to be a 'nice person').
Don't let this be you!
The reason the elections are held at
this time is because, if no one is
voted in (i.e. only crap people have
stood), then there is still plenty of
time to hold another election in the
third term. A second election his
has been the case with certain posts
for the last five years. It is as easy
as that.
The result is that often different
people will stand who were unsure,
for one reason or another, of stand-
ing the first time around. They can
be just as good, and are often better.
Exercise your right to vote for
New Election and in doing so force
the candidates to take your vote
seriously. Make them convince you
they are worthy and in doing so you
will be ensuring the high quality of
the winner.
If the candidate has made you
want to vote for them - do.
If not, vote
NEW
ELECTION
(it's your vote -
don't use itjust
for the sake ofit)
