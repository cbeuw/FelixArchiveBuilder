Felix Editor & Print Unit Manager: Owain Bennallack Proposed by: Jon Jordan
Owain is a final year Computer
Scientist. He's been on both sides
of the Felix door: from nervous
outsider (writing last years' 'Slice
of Life' column) to the respons-
ibilities of Features Editor. No one
is better equipped to produce a
Felix worth reading. Jon Jordan.
Felix is our newspaper and should
try to be relevant to all students in
college. Quality and quantity: as
many people as possible involved to
produce the best we can! It's time
we won prizes!
News
Front cover stories, three pages of
student news, three news editors
(Imperial, St Mary's and external),
department and hall representatives
to enlarge News team.
Opinions
Strong editorial position on current
affairs. Column writers and open
'soapbox' forum. Encourage letters
and debate.
Clubs and Societies
Currently these pages are a mess.
Instead, split it into three sections:
News, Events (forthcoming) and
Reports. Standard format for
contributions to improve readability
and useability. Extended features
produced with Felix support.
Lifestyle
Use the enthusiasm for review
writing to produce a preview section
incorporating all present reviews
pages, cinema listings and expanded
Diary pages. Focus on different
aspects of London life each week:
Sports, Clubland, Festivals etc. with
students in mind.
Features
Getting more quality features requires
strong commitment from the editor.
I'd guarantee four feature pages a
week.
St Mary's...
is a special case: two miles from
Felix, it's clearly more difficult to
get involved. I'll try to resolve this by
recruiting Mary's news and submis-
sions editors and holding fortnightly
meetings on the Mary's campus.
Print Unit
Continue to provide an affordable,
high quality service.
Smooth With A Rippled Underside
Felix should be fun! It should be a
mixture of serious articles, news
and entertainment. Vote for me and
you can have it all!
Felix Editor & Print Unit Manager: Joe McFadden Proposed by: GJ Mitchell
For Felix I've written everything
from news to features, and I ' m
currently cinema editor. Felix
Editor is a job I'd love to do, and I
have the enthusiasm and experience
to do it well. My ideas include:-
• Felix needs a larger news team,
to increase the range of news.
• Features aimed at students (eg
cheap places to go, travel abroad,
careers).
• Sports page covering college
sports.
• Opinion columns.
• Science page focusing on
ground-breaking research at
Imperial.
• Details of C C U events. I've
discussed this with some CCU's,
and will approach the others. St
Mary's is a C C U of Imperial
College, but from Felix you
wouldn't know it. I won't make
promises I can't keep, but I will
find out what Felix can
realistically do to promote St
Mary's events, and improve
communication in general.
• Cinema, gigs, and theatre listings
in the dairy pages as a handy
reference guide of where to go
and what to see (cheaply)
• Felix needs more photographers
for features and college events,
PhotoSoc is one group to
approach.
I want Felix to inform, entertain,
and surprise its readers, but this
depends on getting people
interested and involved. I know
several specialist groups that Felix
could target for recruits, and the
best ways of approaching them.
Imperial has a lot of talent - its time
Felix made full use of it. The office
can be a daunting place to enter, so
a more welcoming layout and
atmosphere is a priority.
I have big plans for Felix, but I
want people's input, so come into
the office and tell me what you'd
like to see.
The Print Unit will continue to
give union clubs and societies a
cost-price service. I understand the
duties of Print Unit Manager and
can do the job.
