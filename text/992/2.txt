Imperial College Boat Club chris-
tened their new £11,000 boat on
Friday. The boat, made by Ray
Simms of Nottingham, was dis-
played at a reception held at the
Boathouse in Putney. The ceremony
was attended by various members
of College management including
the Rector Sir Ronald Oxburgh, as
well as the national boating maga-
an Aeronautical Engineering post-
graduate, was behind the critically
acclaimed B B C programme
'Cyberpunks and Technophobes'.
Speculation has arisen about the
withdrawal of Dave Cohen from the
Presidential race. Sources close to
Mr Cohen have suggested that this
could be connected to departmental
concerns. He withdrew from the
City & Guilds College Union
(C&GCU) Presidential campaign last
year due to academic pressures.
This week has seen the culmina-
tion of the efforts of the C & G C U to
encourage informed voting. Guilds
decided this week to mail every
C & G C U student with information
zine Regatta. The boat was named
the 'Peter Mee' after the College's
Assistant Registrar who was also in
attendance.
B i l l Mason, the Boathouse
Manager, told Felix: "When we've
had internationals who haven't been
able to afford to pay to attend
World Regattas or Championships
he [Peter Mee] has always made
sure that the money has been found
to send the person. We're very
on voting. Speaking to Felix, Paul
Griffith, President of C & G C U said:
"Initial comments have suggested
voters appreciate knowing what we
do. We've had a significant increase
in postgraduate and overseas voters.
The swipe card system, apart from a
few teething troubles, has proved to
be a success."
In what some observers have
termed, "blatant copying", Imperial
College Union will also be mailing
all potential voters before the sab-
batical elections which take place
on 14th and 15th March.
New Election will be standing
for all posts.
grateful for how much he's helped
us in the past."
The new boat will be used by
the mens first VIII as the club has a
'Best Boat to Best Squad' policy.
The club were also displaying
their new minibus, donated by the
Harlington Trust. Imperial College
Boat Club continue to enjoy consid-
erable success with their next major
race being the 'Head of the River'
at the end of this term.
STEP Into
Shape
BY MIKE INGRAM
Applications are now open for the
Shell Technology Enterprise
Programme (STEP).
The scheme places second year
students in eight week projects dur-
ing the summer vacation with
companies who employ less than
200 people. They must complete an
enterprising business project which
will bring a specific benefit to the
host firm. Projects are judged by a
panel of experts, with the best
going on to compete in national
finals. The overall winner gains the
title of 'Most Enterprising Student'.
There are also award categories for
Best Information Technology
Project, Best Manufacturing
Company Project and Best
Environmental Project.
The programme is organised by
Shell U K limited with the aid of a
national network of 70 agencies,
including Training and Enterprise
Councils and Local Enterprise
Agencies. Over 1,000 students are
expected to take part this year.
The projects are intended to pro-
vide students with an opportunity to
develop vital business skills such as
decision making, teamwork and
communication. It also intends to
forge closer links between busi-
nesses and universities. Many
companies have gone on to recruit
students who have worked with
them after they graduate.
Places are available to second
year undergraduates, who are paid
£100 per week (half from the host
company). Students wishing to
apply to join the scheme should
contact the Careers Office in person
in Room 310, Sherfield Building.
Sports
Loan
In last week's Felix Charles Leary,
Deputy President (Clubs and
Societies) was quoted as saying that
the Union took out a loan from the
Harlington Trust to fund the Sports
Centre's refurbishment. The quote
should have stated that the loan was
taken out by College, not the Union.
