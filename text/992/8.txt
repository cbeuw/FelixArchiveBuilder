IC lsts 4 - St Georges 2
Last Saturday saw IC lsts facing St Georges in a
major bottom of the league relegation battle.
Imperial were in low spirits following the
narrow defeat the week before at the hands of
UCL. Also they were missing several of their
key players, so it was a patchwork quilt of a side
made up from most of the second team,
including the perennial second team captain Rax
Muthoo. The game started off with IC easily
taking control, despite some thug-like tackles
from the opposition, who appeared to be the
result of inbreeding between neanderthal men!
IC's quality shone through and Alex de
Stefano was delighted to score his first goal of
the season following good work from Rax and
Anthony Clerc. Mark Nally was scarcely
threatened in goal due to solid defending and
positional play from Matteo Farina and Andy
Fenton. Rickie Dixon was in defence as well.
Ben Willis who should have been in defence
was bent (?) on thrusting forward (!) to increase
Imperial's lead. However, he thrusted too hard
for Christine de Wolf's liking, and she booked
him, claiming she should have sent him off!
Mike Jarvis then increased the goal margin,
before IC felt generous and allowed Georges to
toe-punt the ball in the right direction.
Debut-boy Anthony Clerc netted IC's third,
and Ben Willis coolly slotted another penalty.
Bill Al-Khatib could have scored several, but
Georges defence were so quick they made him
look slower than Ian Finnerty! Georges did
manage another goal, but just to make sure IC
won, Christine the Ref gave George an indirect
free kick in the box, following Matteo picking
the ball up and running twenty yards with it.
Such generosity!
IC 1 -14 Alpine lsts
Due to the arctic weather conditions, our
opposition wisely did not show up. After 30
minutes of waiting we accepted the challenge of
a friendly from another team whose opposition
also did not show up. The Alpine lsts were a
more experienced male team and it showed.
Despite playing 13-a-side, having a former
Imperial 1st team keeper (thanks for playing,
Tim) the score was 0-7 at half time. Goals
included an amazing header from a corner and a
European-style belter from near the centre circle.
A switcharound at half time meant that Mr
Hullsent was sent home, replaced outfield by Mr
Ian 'FHR' Arden. He completely failed to mark
Alpine's goalie-turned-striker who scored with
an absolutely fabulous bicycle kick. However,
Mr Archer did compensate by scoring our only
goal of the match (fluke or wot?).
Even though they wouldn't shake hands with
us afterwards because we were 'girls', our
congratulations go to the Alpine Under 14s who
could easily take on the IC 3rds (and definitely
the 2nds).
IC II1 - UCH 3 St. Mary's 1 - IC II7
The end of season for the Imperial College 2nd
XI is proving to be an exciting roller-coaster.
Having beaten Kings College Hospital, IC fell
to University College Hospital at Harlington
with Mohammed Al-Said scoring the only goal
for the Seconds. Thus, when Imperial travelled
to play St. Mary's, they had to win to keep the
hopes of staying in Division One alive. Indeed
IC obtained an emphatic victory, both in style
and in content.
Billal Al-Khatib provided a number of
critical assists and scored a goal himself, but it
was Nadarajah who hit top form on the day. He
scored four times; now with beautifully flighted
lob, now with a sweet tap-in, always finishing
with style.
The medics also found it difficult to contain
Abs Said and Ritch Craig in midfield, who
played with determination and authority despite
their own deteriorating physical conditions.
Anthony Clerc placed his name on the score
sheet with an excellent finish and could have
had more. However, it was full-back Roddy
Herris, playing with passion and skill, who
scored the finest goal. He won the ball deep in
his own half, played a one-two in the middle,
held off a strong challenge and finished with
composure.
IC 2nds travel to London Colney tomorrow
to play the unbeaten University College 2nds,
with a view to pulling off a major upset.
