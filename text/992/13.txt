Sabbatical Election Manifestoes
Deputy President (Clubs & Societies): Mark Baylis Proposed by: Omar Kheir
I believe that I am in a very good
position to become Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies) as I
have a substantial amount of
experience within the clubs in this
college. I have been Chairman and
Treasurer of the Ski Club and
Second Team Captain for the
Badminton Club. I feel that this has
given me a good insight into the
running of the Union with respect to
the clubs and societies.
I would like to see a major
improvement in the sports facilities
in this College, I think with a new
sports hall it would be possible for
our teams to return to the top of the
U A U championships. In addition to
the obvious advantages for the
sports clubs an improvement in the
amount of sports facilities would
allow the other non-sporting clubs
and societies more space to put on
their events leading to bigger and
better shows and carnivals.
I believe that I could make a
very good job of the Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies) and
the running of this side of the
Union. I hope that you will vote me
in to do this for you.
Deputy President (Clubs & Societies): Maria Moratis Proposed by: Tim Parsons
Why am I running for this
position?
The union, wow! what an important
place or is it? Well, it definitely is
for me since I want to be part of it.
It is what gives our academic life
and all this horrible work a different
flare. You must have been involved
in some society or club, sport,
events or overseas, and have
enjoyed. The driving force behind
all that is the Union.
Personally, I would like to be
involved with these responsibilities
because I would like, and think am
in a position, to mediate for Clubs
and Societies in such way so that
they function sensibly and after all
offer their members a good time.
One my objectives, if elected,
would be to advise Clubs and
Societies on how to make their
activities better known, how to
attract all the people who would
like to get involved but have not
realised that such opportunities are
around. Finally, I would like to help
Societies coexist in peace, which is
usually an issue for Overseas
Societies.
Why am I the best suited
candidate?
I was the Yacht Club's treasurer
this year from which I have gained
immense experience of sports
activities for the students and how
to organise events. In my first year,
I was involved with the Greek
Society which offered me insight on
Overseas Societies and how not
only help foreign students adjust to
their new environment but also
expose their culture to the rest of
the college.
I am full of new views and I am
an outsider to the Union and how it
works since I have not been
involved with it before. Fresh ideas
with respect for established
practices and listening to people's
needs would be my policy.
For all this, I think I am the best....
(cut at the 300th word)
Deputy President (Clubs & Societies): Ian Parish Proposed by: Kate Dalton
I am proposing Ian Parish for the
post of Deputy President (Clubs and
Societies) because I believe he will
make an excellent sabbatical. He
was Aerosoc chairman 92-93, City
& Guilds Departmental Society
Officer 93-94 and has been Assis-
tant Station Manager at I.C. Radio
between 92 and 94. On top of this
he has been the Imperial College
representative to the Royal Aero-
nautical Society for the last two
years. He is a very approachable
character with a wicked sense of
humour, I know he will do a first
rate job of representing and co-
ordinating your Clubs and Societies.
Vote for Ian.
Kate Dalton
If elected I have two main
priorities. The first is to secure
more funding for Clubs and
Societies by sponsorship. I will
approach this in the summer,
concentrating on both local and
nation-wide businesses.
The second is to increase the
services available to Clubs and
Societies. I will clarify the Union's
position with College, a situation
which is confused at the moment. I
increase the amount of room-time
for each Club and Society
according to their real needs. I will
streamline the bureaucracy involved
with Clubs and Societies. I will also
improve and increase the local
sporting facilities available,
including campaigning for a new
local sports hall for the use of
students.
Being on the Guilds exec, I
understand how the decisions made
by ICU affect Clubs and Societies. I
will be the Clubs and Societies
union officer, NOT a union officer
who just happens to be involved
with the Clubs and Societies.
I believe that my involvement in
CCUs and I.C. Radio had given me
the training to fulfil the D.P. job
description right from the start of
my term of office.
