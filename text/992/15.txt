Centre stage for Janacek
Below: an aviating The great Czech composer Leos Janacek did not write his first masterpiece
dragonfly from the until the age of 49. The opera Jenufa, completed in 1903, was composed
Royal Opera's The during the long terminal illness of Janacek's only surviving child, his
Cunning Little Vixen. daughter Olga. This personal tragedy was reflected in Janacek's profound
musical response to the story of a woman who
drowns her daughter's illegitimate baby.
It was in the last ten years of his life,
however, that Janacek's creativity came into
full flower. From 1918 onwards he produced
an uninterrupted stream of masterpieces,
under the influence of a passionate but
platonic reationship with a woman 38 years
his junior. Of the four operas he wrote during
this period, the first, Katya Kabanovd, has
what is perhaps the most tradi-tionally
operatic of ,
Janacek's lib.'
Katya, locked into a
loveless marriage
with an ineffectual
husband, strays into
an adulterous
relationship which
leads to guilt and
suicide. The music
combines rich
lyricism with
jagged, threatening
rhythms and pun-
gent orchestration.
The effect is
overwhelming.
The 1951
Sadler's Wells
production of Katya
gained Janacek a
then, Janacek's humane and often ravishing
treatment of his vivid storylines has edged him
further and further into the operatic mainstream.
London has two major new productions this
year: in June E N O are to stage Jenufa, and
tonight Bernard Haitink conducts what is
surprisingly the first ever production of Katya
Kabanovd at the Royal Opera House.
