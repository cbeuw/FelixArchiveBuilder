ULU's Future Secured Schrodinger Lecture
BY LYNN BRAVEY
The future of the University of
London Union {ULU) looks to have
been safeguarded. At a (University)
Collegiate Council meeting last
Thursday, college representatives
voted for the funding model
favoured by U L U and individual
college Student Unions.
U L U had been under threat since
the Government's decision to dis-
tribute grants directly to the
colleges, rather than via the federal
University.
The model decided upon
involves U L U ' s money being re-
distributed to colleges, half in pro-
portion to student numbers and half
depending on their members' use of
the main U L U building in Malet
Street. The Council also agreed that
college unions will subscribe to
U L U on the same basis. They
decided that this method of distrib-
uting funds was more justifiable as
it took into account the fact that col-
leges in central London are likely to
make more use of U L U facilities
than those further away.
Simon Rix, the U L U President
commented on the vote: "This is
excellent news for all students in
the University of London. U L U will
now definitely be here well into the
next century providing services to
thousands of students throughout
London."

Nobel laureate Max Perutz will be
giving the seventh Schrodinger
Lecture at Imperial College on
Thursday 17th March.
Dr Perutz, who was given the
Prize for his work on Haemoglobin,
will give the lecture on 'Living
Molecules' in the Great Hall,
Sherfield Building, at 5.30pm. The
Schrodinger Lectures explore a
range of scientific topics in a man-
ner accessible to a wide audience.
"Schrodinger was a man of broad
scientific interests, and therefore a
suitable person to commemorate by
lectures on a range of scientific top-
ics," said Professor Brian Coyles of
the Department of Physics.
Previous lecturers include
Stephen Hawking and Benoit
Mandelbrot. This year's lecture will
feature a demonstration of how to
make DNA with a kitchen blender.
Seat tickets should be reserved in
advance from M r J Vandridge-
Ames in the College Registry.
Mary's Melee
BY MIKE INGRAM
Disputes have erupted between St
Mary's and Charing Cross and
Westminster Medical School (CX)
over a mascotry-style raid.
Students from St Mary's went
on a carefully planned sortie to
retrieve two stone bears stolen from
the School sixteen years ago. After
kidnapping the C X Union President
by setting both of her arms in plas-
ter, they sent a small reconnaissance
group to C X to check the layout,
exits and where the students were
located. The group returned to St
Mary's to pick up ten people, a
minibus and numerous tools. They
then managed to retrieve the sym-
bolic bears with many students still
inside the C X building. The group
also took the C X mascot, a brass
cross which is traditionally signed
by every medic who graduates.
The raid has angered C X , with
its Dean complaining to the St
Mary's administration. The school
is also demanding £400 to cover
damage caused during the raid.
Obituary — Yasmin Saud
Yasmin came to IC as an under-
graduate in the mathematics
department. Last year she went on
to study for an MSc in aeronautics.
Due to illness she had to leave her
studies and sadly she died last week.
Yasmin was always an enthusi-
astic sportswoman, playing squash,
basketball and football for various
College teams. Her great love was
for hangliding. During May of 1993
she organised and flew in the first
ever hangliding expedition to
Jordan.
In appreciation of all the help
she received from the staff of the
Royal Marsden Hospital, Yasmin
wished to raise money for cancer
research. Along with Judy Leden
(World Women's Hangliding
Champion) and Ben Ashman
(European Microlight Champion)
she conceived the 'Flight for Life',
a microlight flight from London to
Jordan in aid of the Cancer
Research Fund. It should take place
later this year, dedicated to her
memory.
Yasmin was a smiling, happy
person and she is greatly missed.
