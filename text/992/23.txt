Cracking Cryptic Crosswords
Lesson 9. Greek characters.
The Greek alphabet gets more than its fair share
of use in cryptic clues. A Greek letter might be
referred to as just that (a Greek letter), a Greek
character, a letter from Greece or something
else along those lines.
1. Greek character at the function (5)
'Function' being an anagram-indicator. An easy
down clue could read:
2. Greek character ate up (3)
Remember from last week how a flower
probably does not mean anything floral?
3. A letter from Greece describes a flower's
end (5)

Lesson 10. Foreign Languages
Knowledge of French, German, Italian and
Spanish is handy when solving cryptic
crosswords. Don't panic, you won't need to
actually read those Berlitz phrase books you
bought years ago. Taking French as an
example, possibilities include:
L E , L A The French; In Paris, the; French
article...
UN, U N E A French, French one...
J E In France I, in Paris I...
DES Some French
L E S In France, they...
M Frenchman (Monsieur)
'The Spanish' is E L and 'the Italian' is I L .
German articles are DIE, DAS, D E R , E I N or
EINE. A 'foreign article' could refer to any of
the above mentioned articles.
4. Famous scientist seen as a German mug (8)
5. Time for a French melody (4)
6. Take issue from point with German (4)
7. Love some French poetry (4)
8. Premium due for good showing in France
and America (5)
[See 1 Down above.]
Lesson 11. Heads Off, Docks tails
Still on the theme of building blocks for words,
yet more quirky tricks are employed:
C = Capital of Cuba, can-opener, could start...
G = head of government, pig's tail, legend,
midnight...
H = headstart...
L = first light...
Y = end of January...
to name but a few.
9. Amusement for the figurehead at the
international organisation (3)
10. Might get a degree before the end of July
(3)
Remember the In your face clues (Lesson 7)?
With that in mind try these:
11. Employer taking first of the undergraduates
satisfying educational requirements (4)
or worse still:
12. The odds from my end I'd already interfered
with (7)
Lesson 12. Shortcomings
It is not uncommon for the beginning or end of
a word to be discarded to get the answer. Take
the word IDEA and you'll notice that it is the
word I D E A L without the L :
The endless perfect concept (4)
13. There's endless dressing for the bird (5)
14. Prepared not to finish and to study (4)
Error: second abbreviation for sailor given last week should read OS (ordinary seaman) not OB (a continental sanitary towel).
