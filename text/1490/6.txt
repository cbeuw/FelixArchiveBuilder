H
i, I’m Chris, a 2nd year
student in Electronic &
Electrical Engineering.
Not enough students know
that they are welcome to Coun-
cil to voice their opinions.
I will ensure more students
know what’s being discussed
at Council and feel welcome
and able to take part. It would
be great to see more students
coming along to voice their
opinions and hold our sabbati-
cal officers to account. I will
continue producing paper sum-
maries before Council and pub-
lishing them online, and also in
Felix if suitable.
Our union does lots of great
things, but most students don’t
know about them. As well as
publicising decisions before

eing a sabbatical offi-
cer has so far been the
highlight of my four
years at Imperial. I have loved
dedicating my time to students
as ICSMSU President, but still
feel that I have more to offer the
wider Imperial community.
This year has taught me skills
extremely relevant to this role:
I chair numerous Faculty and
Students’ Union committees
and have learned how to en-
courage contributions from qui-
eter members, minimise repeti-
tion and ensure that discussions
do not centre solely around
vocal members. I am currently
a member of Council and a per-
manent observer of the Trustee
Board, so know what the job
entails.
T
he Council Chair is a
tough role because it re-
quires one to remain im-
partial and never take sides for
any discussions. It also requires
one to be assertive to keep dis-
cussions controlled, and at the
same time be able to absorb
information presented quickly.
But the most important trait a
Council Chair should have is a
passion for our university and a
desire to serve the students.
With my ability to separate
emotion and work, and to pro-
cess information, I certainly
make a good candidate for the
role. However, I will excel as
the Council Chair and the main
reason is my passion for our
university and for serving other
students. It was also for this
they happen, I’ll work hard to
publicise the results of Coun-
cil’s work in Felix and on the
Union website. If students
know we’re working hard for
them, they’ll be more support-
ive of the Union and trust us to
get things done.
The council chair must have
a good working knowledge of
the Union and the constitution.
I’ve got experience working in
all parts of our Union; I’ve been
a club president, DJ, welfare of-
ficer and even web developer.
My wide ranging experience
has given me a lot of exposure
to the constitution, key knowl-
edge for a successful council
chair.
It’s also important that the
council chair is impartial. I
promise not to get involved in any
policy making and to strive for
fair and equal discussion in every
meeting.

for Council Chair.

Council is the highest com-
mittee at Imperial College
Union but still has difficulty in
reaching out to students, many
of whom do not know what
function it serves. As ICSMSU
President, I have witnessed the
capacity of Faculty Unions to
connect with their members on
a more personal basis. I know
Jenny has done some great
work this year in increasing
understanding of what Council
involves, and I would continue
this by ensuring that summa-
ries of the key items discussed
in each Council are included
in Presidents’ newsletters to
their students, along with a de-
scription of agenda items for
the following Council, and en-
couragement of all students to
attend if there are any issues that
they would like to discuss. Greater
understanding of the role Council
will hopefully result in wider inter-
action with it.
Thanks for reading.

H
i, I am Abdul Patel, a
second year materials
student and it would be
a privilege for me to represent
you guys as court advocate for
the following year. A court ad-
vocate position is to promote
the court and to increase ac-
cessibility to all students that
may require its service. Having
attended meetings before, I am
well aware of how the council
operates. Furthermore, I have
been present and even repre-
sented somebody in the union
court in which subsequently,
his disciplinary decision was
overturned.
I personally feel that the ap-
proachability of the court to
the student body is insufficient.
If, for any unfortunate circum-
A
s a member of the Wel-
fare Committee, I will
ensure that the Equal
Opportunities Code is adhered
to by the Union. I will endeav-
our to fulfil this role by:
• Voicing my opinions in the
best interest of all Imperial
students at all committee meet-
ings.
• Liaising efficiently with the
Education & Welfare Sabbati-
cal Officer on equal access to
welfare for all students.
• Making myself accessible
by ensuring that students know
who I am and how to approach
me - I pledge to listen and re-
spond to all queries, sugges-
tions, comments or complaints
made by students.
• Participating actively at
A
s Equal Opportuni-
ties Officer, I would
continue to promote
equality, tackle discrimination
and give the necessary help and
support to the different com-
munities at Imperial; as well
as continue to help run positive
welfare week campaigns.
I am an experienced welfare
officer as I currently hold a
number of welfare positions in
IQ (Imperial College LGBT)
and the Union. I am the current
Equal Opportunities Officer
and so have worked with the
Deputy President of Welfare
on many welfare issues and
have run many campaigns of
my own. I am also the Welfare
Officer of IQ and the acting
SHAG Week Coordinator.
stances, you may find yourself
having disciplinary actions
against you or your society, I
want to ensure that you get all
the help and guidance you may
require so that you have the
best possible chance of fight-
ing your case. I am well aware
of the constitutional rules and
I shall advise you, to augment
your chance of having the de-
cision overruled. In addition, I
will increase the transparency
of the rules and court matters
to reduce the ambiguity it may
pose.
Thank you for taking the time
to read this. If you have any
questions regarding my mani-
festo, or on my stance on any-
thing I have discussed, please

So please, vote experience, vote
passion but most importantly,
vote for somebody that listens and
cares, vote Abdul.

every opportunity to provide a
platform for Imperial students
to have their opinions heard on
relevant issues by those who
have the resources to imple-

Through this I hope to help

I have noticed a number of
problems with the current wel-
fare system that I would like to
change.
If elected, I will:
• Raise the profile of the wel-
fare officers around college to
make them more available as
points of contact.
• Support and advise the wel-
fare officers; to help them with
any welfare events and cam-
paigns.
• Continue to work with the
DPW towards the opening of a
Sexual Health clinic in the Im-
perial Medical Centre.
In short, I believe that I am
the most experienced candidate
for the Equal Opportunities Of-
ficer role, am able to provide
development in the field of
equality, and will ensure fairness
in all university life.
