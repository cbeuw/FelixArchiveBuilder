Last weekend the home of English
rugby, Twikenham, hosted the penulti-
mate round of this year’s International
Rugby Board international rugby sev-
ens tournament. Sevens is a variation
on the fifteen-a-side traditional Rugby
Union game, which, as the name sug-
gests is played with seven players on
each team.
The IRB international sevens series
is played in a eight different countries
including Dubai, Hong Kong and the
far less glamorous location of Scotland.
Performances in each of the different
stages are combined in order to crown
an overall series champion. The series is
into its twelfth year with New Zealand
wrapping up their ninth overall title fol-
lowing a strong performance in London
this weekend a week before the final
round of games to be held in Scotland.
The tournament has four prizes of
decreasing importance; the cup, plate,
bowl and shield. Such a system means
that a poor showing on the first day of
the tournament will allow a team to
compete on the second day albeit for a
much less coveted prize.
England had been in contention to
challenge New Zealand for the overall
series crown however; their hopes were
dashed following a poor show during
the first series of matches on Saturday.
England’s team boasted Ben Gollings,
the highest points scorer in the history
of sevens, but even he nor the huge
home support within the stadium could
prevent England falling to a shock 21-
14 defeat to France.
Following this below par performance
England could only manage a 12-12
draw with Argentina in their final match
on Saturday, which prevented them
from progressing to the quarterfinals of
the cup for the first time this year. Due
to England’s inability to reach the later
stages of the cup, the onus was very
much on New Zealand who had quali-
fied for the cup quarterfinals to be held
on Sunday with a perfect record. TheAll
Blacks knew that because of England’s
dismal showing a strong run in the cup
competition would provide them with
the overall series title.
New Zealand eventually succumbed
to the power of Fiji in the semi final
of the cup, despite their obvious disap-
pointment at not being able to contest
the final, the All Blacks took some con-
solation in the fact that they had secured
the overall title.
Fiji themselves fell in the final to their
southern hemisphere neighbours, South
Africa.After trailing the Fijians 14-0 the
South Africans turned the game around
eventually coming out on top 24-14 giv-
ing them their second cup crown of this
year’s series and their first on English
soil since 2005.
Samoa. who were the overall series
winner in 2010, have had a poor season
by their standards yet managed to over-
come Australia in the final of the plate
to salvage some hope of a turnaround
next year.
Scotland overcame Kenya in the fi-
nal of the bowl thanks to a last minute
try from Andrew Turnbull leaving the
Kenyan team, strongly backed by the
Twikenham crowd, heartbroken. The
Kenyans had earlier in the day deal Eng-
land a further blow by knocking them
out of the bowl competition, leaving
the hosts to scrap for the shield crown
which they duely won beating Portugal
22-7 providing the only silver lining in a
drab weekend for the host team.
Despite the obvious disappointment
at England not putting on a more con-
vincing display of their prowess at sev-
ens, the crowd seemed unperturbed. A
record 54,357 people turned up on the
Saturday followed by over 50,000 on
the Sunday resulting in this being the
Wolverines fall at last hurdle
New Zealand beat
England to overall
Sevens crown
most attended tournament since the se-
ries began twelve years ago. The theme
set for the tournament was ‘beachwear’
meaning that thousands of people
decked out in bikinis, Bermuda shirts,
and wife beater vests descended on HQ.
There were reports that some support-
ers enjoyed themselves a little too much
with a male known only as ‘Ross’ taken
in an ambulance from the South stand
of the stadium after downing excessive
quantities of alcohol.

what we could. To everyone’s surprise
we came out victorious, 3-2! Another
IC record smashed – until then we had
never beaten a higher ranking team in
our league!
The last game in the group stages vs
Underdodge B we won 4 – 1 thus mean-
ing we finished top in our group and
setting up a semi-final against South-
ampton 1s, the home team. By this time
we were tiring and, outmatched, we lost
badly 4-1. However, in the third game
of the match Alan and Adam again im-
pressed the crowds with another double
catch. Our last hope now of qualifying
for the Nationals was to beat Fellows
Appreciation Society, a team of ex-
Warwick Uni players, in the 3rd place
playoff.
Having watched our previous games
and noted our reliance on good catch-
ing play, they wisely concentrated on
not giving our catchers the opportunity
to do what they do best, and so threw at
our other players. This made the games
difficult for us, not being able to make
catches or play efficiently. We put up a
good fight, but finally lost 4-1. We head-
ed back to London with our heads held
high, happy with our performance albeit
a little disappointed in not being able to
qualify for the national championships.
Also, we would like to give a special
mention to Dan Price for stepping in at
extremely short notice!
