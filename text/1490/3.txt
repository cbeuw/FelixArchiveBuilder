A review into the wardening system
has recommended reducing the number
of sub-wardens by around 15%. The
reductions, which will occur through
the normal turnover of contracts, are
aimed at rebalancing the College’s
welfare provision towards counselling
and disability services.
The recommendations will see a
total of nine subwarden posts being
removed from Eastside, Southside,
Orient House, Holbein Willis Jackson,
and Fisher Hall. The wardening review
ran from May 2010 to March 2011 and
on comparing Imperial’s wardening
provision with other universities found
that the ratio of wardening staff to
students at Imperial was significantly
higher than at comparable institutions
(1:30 at Imperial vs. 1:84 at UCL, on
average).
It was decided that halls with a ratio of
1:31 or less would have a reduction of
one subwarden beginning in 2011/2012,
with the caveat that no hall should have
less than four wardening staff. The
reduction will see the average ratio at
Imperial rise to 1:34.
The recommendations note that ‘the
College’s very favourable Wardening
ratios make an important contribution to
the halls system’ but argues that ‘some
economies in the budget are necessary’
due to the current financial climate. The

around 50% of the College’s welfare
budget.
In a report to Union Council last
week, Deputy President (Welfare)
Charlotte Ivison said that the reductions
were an “economic measure” and that
“no subwardens will have to leave their
post prematurely”. Some sub-wardens
may have to move hall as a result of the
reductions.
The Dean of Students Denis Wright,
who chaired the Review Panel, did not

Tory MP implicated in ConSoc tour charge
Greg Hands, MP for Chelsea and
Fulham and parliamentary private
secretary to George Osborne, is alleged
to have been involved in the prohibited
sale of tickets for a tour of the Houses of
Parliament by the Conservative Society
at Imperial.
Politicalscrapbook.net, which
describes its content as “left wing news
and gossip”, claimed that Imperial
College London’s Conservative Society
sold tickets for a “Houses of Parliament
Tour with Greg Hands” to its members
for five pounds. The blog points to a
‘What’s On’ advertisements in a copy
of Felix dated October 2009 as evidence
of its claim. The blog links to the issue
published online and remarks “MPs
can sponsor tours of Parliament for
constituents who would like to visit.
Tours are given to constituents free of
charge, and must not be sold for profit to
third parties” – a quote that it takes from
the Speaker’s website.
The question which has arisen is
whether Greg Hands providing these
tickets to the Conservative Society
with them selling for profit constitutes
a breach of the regulation. In 2005,
Conservative MP Jonathan Sayeed
was expelled from the Tory party
for profiting from private tours of
Parliament.
Felix contacted Greg Hands, who
clarified that he “didn’t give any
such tour” and Hansard, a record of
proceedings in Parliament, confirms he
was leading a Westminster Hall debate
on Russia on that date for the hours at
which the tour was supposed to have
taken place. He added, “I do regularly
sponsor tours for constituents, schools
and other groups connected to Chelsea
and Fulham” and that they are free
Rector’s Awards announced
The recipients of the annual Rector’s
Awards for Excellence in Teaching
and in Research Supervision have
been announced this week. The staff
honoured range across departments and
faculties and include two academics
who were affected by the Life Sciences
restructure.
The teaching awards are presented
to those staff who are judged ‘to have
been most outstanding in the quality,
organisation and presentation of their
teaching’. 17 staff members have been
given the award this year, which will
be presented to them in November on
College Education Day. Of the 17, two
were awarded the Rector’s Medals for
Outstanding Contribution to Teaching
Excellence – Mr Zen Makuch and Dr
Sandra Shefelbine. The highest honour,
the Rector’s Medal for Outstanding
Innovation in Teaching, was awarded
to Dr Jane Saffell of the Life Sciences
department, in addition to her Award
for Excellence in Teaching. Dr Saffell
faced the possibility of redundancy
following the Life Sciences restructure
but has since moved to the Faculty of
Medicine.
In an email to members of the
Department of Life Sciences, Professor
Ian Owens saluted the ‘exceptional
contribution’ that Dr Saffell and other
receipents from Life Sciences have
made ‘to the Department’s activities’.
The Rector’s Awards for Excellence
in Research Supervision were awarded
to ProfessorAnthony Bull and Professor
Andrew Bush, who also received
Rector’s Medals. The award recognises
‘staff who have made exceptional
contributions in providing a supportive
learning environment for postgraduate
research students’.
tours given by the House rather than
himself. “I don’t play any direct part in
organising them and I wouldn’t dream
of charging anyone.”
At the time of print Felix is unable
to clarify whether or not the tour went
ahead as the Conservative Society was
unavailable for comment. However,
an unverified member purporting to
represent ConSoc posted a comment
explaining that the tickets were sold “in
order to raise funds from their members
to fund further events” and that this
had “nothing to do with Greg Hands”.
The user added, “five pounds was the
minimum amount one could charge to
sell tickets online” through the Union
website. Hands mentioned that “anyone
at Imperial who is a Chelsea or Fulham
resident can contact [him] via the
House of Commons, and Parliament
will be able to arrange a free-of-charge
tour.”
