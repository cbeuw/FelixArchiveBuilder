Imperial College Dodgeball
SE England Championship
Tom Peake
On Sunday May 15th, Imperial Wol-
verines I played their last and most
important Dodgeball tournament of
the year. Placing in the top 3 teams
would guarantee a place in the National
Championships in June. The team met
early at Waterloo, and after seemingly
been fraudulently sold the wrong type
of group discount ticket, headed off to
Southampton where the South East Eng-
land Championship would be played.
Our first match was against Win-
chester Bullets 1s. We expected a com-
fortable start to the event, as we were
clear favourites, but after a number of
mistakes in the nervous opening ex-

down. We were in serious danger of
failing to qualify from our group.
Club captain, Alan Soltani, was
somewhat distressed at this point. The
Wolverines had never in the past won a
match (5 games) from two games down.
The third game was close, but we were
building our confidence and making
fewer mistakes, and as a result we won.
Back to our usual capabilities we won
the 4th game, with Alan and Adam Cut-
more making a trademark simultaneous
catch.
Only one game left to make Imperial
College dodgeballing history. It wasn’t
one for the faint hearted. At one point
we were 6 players to 3 down, but we
managed to secure a win thanks to a vi-
tal catch by Tom Peake, bringing Alan
back in to finish them off.
Next match was against Portsmouth
Cobras C. It was a match to enjoy and
relax, we won 5-0, boosting our confi-
dence further before the most difficult
match of our group vs Knights.
We had a team talk in a separate gym
to raise team morale and clarify tactics;
we knew our chance of success against
Knights was slim, as they had previ-
ously beaten us fairly comfortably. Just
giving it our best shot, and fresh with
two matches already won, we gave it
