Lessons from the Mech
Eng refurbishment
T
he renovation of
the Mechanical
E n g i n e e r i n g
Department has not
run smoothly, to put
it mildly. As Felix has reported
in previous weeks, it has seen
delays, hiccups, and errors that
have caused snorts of derision
aroundcampus.Withthisinmind,
we suggested to the College and
the Department that they open the
doors to the department to show
us a renovation that is nearing
completion, and also to open up
about the challenges that they
have faced and the reason why
the renovation has experienced
so many problems. They agreed
and last Tuesday I found myself
donning a high-vis jacket, a hard
hat, and a pair of rugged black
boots that wouldn’t look out of
place at a Slayer concert, to head
into what is very much an active
construction site.
I’m with Steve Howe,
Director of Capital Projects
and Planning, Tim Venables
the Operations Manager for
Mechanical Engineering, and
Steve Martin, Operating Officer
for the Faculty of Engineering.
When I first meet them, the
sense of ‘you’ve been writing
about us’ hangs in the air, but
they’re relaxed, the worst of
the renovation is past them and
they’re looking forward to the
work being completed in July,
with students moving back
in the months following – as
Steve Howe puts it, people are
usually miffed while the work is
ongoing, but then appreciate the
product when it’s completed.
The renovation of levels zero
and one of the Mechanical
Engineering building was always
going to be fraught with difficulty.
Combine a technically difficult
job with a bunch of extremely
intelligent PhD students whose
work has been disrupted and
you’re likely to see tensions rise.
Errors such as the building of a
£3 million exhaust system with
galvanised steel – meaning that
before long the warm corrosive
gases that it is supposed to vent
would degrade it – were met
with disbelief by Mechanical
Engineers; one can imagine them
shaking their heads and saying
“but it’s so obvious!”
But not always. Take for
example a problem they
encountered with a large
hydraulic oil pump that
caused vibrations throughout
the building when turned on.
In January the problem was
discovered – noise could be
heard in lecture theatres – and
it wasn’t until April that the
problem was fixed when better
damping was installed on the
pumps. Why wasn’t it foreseen
that a pump would cause
vibrations that moved through
the building? There’s an almost
identical machine in Skempton,
which had the same type of
damping (and had been installed
by the same contractor), that
didn’t create any problems at
all. From the College’s point of
view, there was no evidence to
suggest that the Mech Eng pump
would behave any differently.
As we walk around I see the
little and not so little hiccups
that have caused delays. The
infamous £3 million exhaust
system looms above our head.
They’ve almost completed the
corrective work on it but as
expected won’t tell me what the
liability could be; with lawyers
involved Steve Howe is careful
not to say anything that could
jeopardise Imperial’s chances of
getting the best deal possible. I
ask about the sound-proofing in
the engine testing labs and am
conveniently pointed towards
the label on the wall which says
‘sound insulation’.
There’s no doubt that the
Department and College
have taken pains to correct
all the problems that they’ve
encountered. Indeed the new
labs are impressive and the
investment shouldn’t be tainted
by the difficulties that they’ve
faced – these truly are modern,
world-class facilities. The pivotal
question is why were so many
problems encountered and what
has been learnt?
Thereisofcoursetheobligatory
explanation that construction
jobs are often overrun and that
the reason that you always have
a contingency fund is because it’s
inevitable that something’s going
to crop up. But as Steve Howe
himself notes, the College have
delivered projects under-budget
and early before, why not this
one?
‘The work that we’re asking
the designers and contractors to
do is technically difficult. It’s
pushing their boundaries’, says
Steve. Tim Venables concurs
with him pointing to the fact
that building a mechanical
engineering lab is far more
difficult than renovating a
lecture theatre. Although neither
of them say it explicitly, there
seems to be a sense that the
technical complexity of the job
perhaps wasn’t fully appreciated
from the start. Steve Howe says
that in future they’ll be taking
a much finer tooth-comb to the
specifications and requirements
of each room and involve more
in-house specialist expertise.
“We know that there’s a need
to scrutinise the use of each and
every room in a very detailed
way to understand exactly what
is required.” He adds, “in the
past we’ve expected the designer
or contractor to bring in their
own specialists in areas where
its needed, but in future I think
that we’re going to be doing that
on our end regardless”.
Put his comments into the
context of the renovation and
they’re hardly surprising. All of
the parties involved probably
could have a done a better job in
ensuring that the finished product
would be exactly fit for purpose.
To Imperial’s credit, where
they’ve identified shortcomings
they haven’t simply sat on their
hands. This is a ‘better late than
sub-standard’ situation.
So what to think of this £36
million refurbishment? Certainly
the disruption caused to PhD
students shouldn’t be ignored;
it’s hard not to sympathise with
them when you see slightly
cramped facilities that they’re
using while they wait to move
back into the proper labs. There
are hints that the delays have
caused friction between the
Department and the College, but
again that’s hardly surprising.
The College has recently applied
for planning permission to
modernise the exterior of part
of the Mech Eng building by
cladding it in aluminium, and
I get the impression that when
the renovation is completed and
the lessons have been learned,
that any acrimony will fade into
distant memory. Except for the
exhaust – that’ll probably be a
running joke in the Mech Eng
department for quite some time.
