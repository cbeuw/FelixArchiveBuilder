ELECTIONS
T
he CAG Chair is respon-
sible for managing and
creating volunteering
projects for Imperial students.
The management role will in-
clude liaising with external
organisations and maintaining
good relationships with those
who support Community ac-
tion group initiatives like the
Soup Run. It will also involve
recruiting participants on a reg-
ular basis to keep ongoing proj-
ects running. The creation role
will involve supporting new
initiatives and attending meet-
ings on behalf of these projects
at the Union.
I think I would be suitable for
the role of CAG Chair because
of my passion for helping oth-
ers and the experiences I have
C
ommunity Action
Group is what is best
about Imperial students
- it provides an opportunity to
work with those less fortunate
than ourselves and help them
and their community. The range
of activities that the Commu-
nity Action Group undertakes
is as diverse and innovative
as the students who run them.
From the African Development
Project to the Soup Run, there
are groups helping communi-
ties both close to home and
overseas.
This year is the first year the
Project have run within CAG
and as such it has seen a lot of
transition. As Deputy President
(Clubs & Societies) this year
I led an overhaul of Union fi-
S
aber King – what more
needs to be said? CAG
needs a “king”, and I’m
the guy for the job.
If you want somebody who
has a genuine interest in help-
ing the needy, then vote for
me. I have actually taken part
in CAG activities, collect-
ing sandwiches and preparing
drinks for the homeless every
Sunday. My experience with
the organisation means I will be
able to safeguard the interests
of those who benefit from our
help better than somebody who
does not take part. I have the
support of every other mem-
ber, so if you vote for me, you
will be voting for the candi-
date whom CAG wants as their
chair. I mean, you would have
gained through volunteering
with Oxfam, Imperial CAG and
the NHS. Further to this I have
experience in developing and
managing projects.
I think that as an Imperial
student it’s important that we
benefit from what we spend
our precious time on. If you
vote me to Chair, on top of my
main responsibilities, I will
work with Imperial’s Volun-
teer Centre and if possible a
Charity so that CAG offers a
broader range of opportunities,
which addresses the interests of
more people: those who want to
develop skills, build self confi-
dence and even just socialise.
Importantly I will keep you up
to date with when, where and
how you can get involved.

nancial regulations to allow
Projects to use the Union bank
account. I also facilitated the
setting up of a robust process
allowing ambitious Projects to
access College insurance whilst
abroad. These processes and
more need to be maintained and
developed to continue making
the Union a friendly place for
Projects to operate, a mission
I want to continue next year as
CAG Chair.
As I’ve operated at all levels
of the Union from Secretary of
a club to a Deputy President I
understand the pressures facing
Projects. I am organised and
efficient and want to make vol-
unteering easier and more ac-
cessible for both the organisers
and students who want to get
involved. Vote for me to put volun-
teering on the map at Imperial and
make sure that Projects get the sup-
port they need.

to be mentally challenged to
vote for someone who does not
play football to be chair of the
football society, and the same
principles should apply here.
I’m assuming that if you’ve
read this far, you are consider-
ing voting. Do vote, it’s defi-
nitely worth the effort, and vote
for me - I’m the best candidate,
honest. If you don’t know what
CAG is, that doesn’t matter,
just vote for me anyway!
I have a lot of experience
in organising volunteer work,
having been involved in a range
of charitable societies during
my time at secondary school,
so you know you can put your
trust in me to make CAG the
best it can be! Just remember –
Saber King for CAG chair!

CAGChair
H
ello everyone! I’m
Hamza, a 3rd year Me-
chanical Engineering
undergrad, competing for the
prestigious position of RAG
chair. My motivation to volun-
teer in RAG is simplistically
defined; to improve the partici-
pation rate in this noble cause.
My inclinations to serve as
RAG Chair are not unfounded.
Being a part of the hall senior
team last year in Pembridge
taught me to embrace the es-
sence and importance of team
dynamics. Throughout my time
at Imperial, I have volunteered
for various charity causes in-
cluding the Haiti earthquake,
Pakistan floods, collections for
bone marrow transplant for
children (in collaboration with
I
’ve been heavily involved
in RAG, never passing up
an opportunity to get stuck
in and raise money, and I feel
it’s one of the very best things
about being at University- com-
bining charity with our student
urges to dress up and have fun.
It takes mass-involvement for
good causes to a new level - we
learn about many charities and
causes and our actions do the
same for the general public.
If elected, I will-
-Be willing to listen to ideas
people have and if possible,
try to make them happen. You
could feel free to drop me an
email or talk to me
-consult postgrads about how
they can or want to get involved
-Publicise RAG much more-

The Union definitely
needs a creative, proactive, and
innovative Raising and Giving
Chairman. It is concerned with
the fundraising events that are
on offer.
Being a regular with the RAG
events I know what events are
on offer, have my personal
view on what is deemed suc-
cessful and which areas could
use improvement. The job is
such a virtuous act and one that
should be made more accessi-
ble and widely acknowledged.
Upon entering Imperial, I was
elated to find out that fundrais-
ing is established and attempted
to partake on as many events
as possible. I was honoured to
UCL) and the recent tsunami
tragedy which occurred in Ja-
pan. It was through these past
experiences, I was able to un-
derstand how serving MechSoc
as a Secretary could render me
useful in my stride to make a
marked difference in the lives
of Mechanical Engineering stu-
dents at Imperial, by providing
a lubricant between the mem-
bers and the committee, as well
as an avenue of feedback per-
taining to any improvements.
Apart from the famous RAG
week, I would be keen on or-
ganising more exciting activi-
ties such as bungee jumping
and hitchhiking for charity for
the adventurous ones out there.
Furthermore, I shall be keen on
arranging more social events
to accommodate all the years. It
is imperative, that as your Chair, I
will work closely with you, in or-
der to realise the vision for RAG.
I sincerely look forward to serving
you as RAG Chair. Please, lend me
your support and believe in mine.

lectures as possible in fresh-

weeks to raise awareness about
RAG and its events
-Use the (un)friendly rivalry
between the Faculty Unions
more, through increased at-
tempts at mascot theft and com-
petitions through the year
-Increase incentives for Halls to
raise money, maintain good con-
tact with their reps and hold meet-

Services, The Avenues Youth
Project at Edutain, and obtained

Naida has done such a fantas-
tic job this year and I hope to
carry on her great work whilst
implementing my own ideas. I
dream to be the person that can
beat the record of the highest
RAG achievement of 9 years
ago in which we raised a stag-
gering 100k in just one year!
By voting for me, not only
are you voting for someone that
is passionate about this topic,
but also a person that is experi-
enced, dedicated and confident
in coordinating large groups of
people and measures.
Please give me this opportunity
to lead this organisation. I promise
I won’t let you down. Thanks for
reading!
