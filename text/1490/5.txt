Life Sciences
Teaching Review
proposals approved
The Science Studies Committee has
approved the recommendations of
the Life Sciences Teaching Review,
after initially rejecting them last week.
The committee were satisfied that
the department had addressed their
concerns and that ‚Äúits requirements
for the academic quality of degree
programmes had been met‚Äù.
One of the areas of concern that the
committee raised was the appointment
of a new Director of Undergraduate
Studies (DoUGS) to take the proposals
forward. The need to appoint a DoUGS,
after redundancies from the Life
Sciences Restructure, was ‚Äòurgent‚Äô.
Other areas of concern included the
3rd year course options available and
the possibility of over-subscribed lab
courses.
The Chair of the Committee,
Professor Richard Thompson, said
that the department had now appointed
a new DoUG and that if lab courses
were heavily over-subscribed, the
department had confirmed that ‚Äúit
would double up lab sessions for those
courses‚Äù. He said that the Committee
was ‚Äúpleased‚Äù the department had
improved ‚Äúseveral aspects of the
structure and teaching of its courses‚Äù
but noted that it would be ‚Äúchallenging
to implement all the changes‚Äù before the
next academic year.

College security officers, reacting to a
report last Wednesday of the theft of a
laptop computer, chased two young men
across campus leading to an arrest and
the assault of a security officer.
A second year graduate student
reported the theft of their laptop from a
desk in the computing lab, Room 303,
in the Electrical Engineering building
at 1pm. Another student, working in
the lab, gave a description to security of
two young men in their early-mid teens
wearing jeans, trainers and grey hooded
tops, each carrying black rucksacks.
At 1.30pm, members of staff in the
Huxley building reported two young
men matching these descriptions,
wandering the building and attempting
to open doors.
A security officer, responding to
the report, confronted the pair on the
campus walkway. The two youths
split up; one running back into the
Sherfield building and the second ran
down the outside stairwell, dropping his
rucksack. At the bottom of the stairwell,
another security officer confronted
him. He forced his way past the officer,
punching him in the face, and ran off
in the direction of the gate on Prince
Consort road. A builder, working at the
nearby construction site, saw him run
up an alley between the church and an
adjoining building.
The on-duty security officer at Beit,
Jonathan Adams, left his post to give
chase and caught the youth on Bremner
road. Shortly after, the security team
arrived with the police. The young man
was arrested and charged with burglary
and assault.
The dropped bag was later searched
by police and found to contain the
student‚Äôs stolen laptop. This was taken
back to the station for fingerprinting and
has now been returned to the student.
Analysis of CCTV footage revealed
a picture of the second young man,
who escaped. Police identified him as a
known suspect, and are reported to have
contacted him at his home address.
Darren Barrow, Senior Security
Officer and Investigations and Crime
management for the college, said the
pair could be responsible for previous
thefts on campus as they clearly had
knowledge of the layout of campus.
The assaulted security officer, who
did not wish to be named, sustained
slight bruising to the eyebrow, but was
not seriously injured.
