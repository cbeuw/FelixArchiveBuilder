GAME
What did you study at Imperial?
I did the BSc in Physics from ‘97 to
2000, although even then I was fiddling
with computers a lot more than I was
paying attention to my physics course,
unfortunately.
So you finished your BSc and then
what happened?
So then what happened was I ended up
getting a job in a software company that
made network management software for
financial services companies. I didn’t go
straight into the games industry at all,
and that wasn’t what I was planning
at all. I started out as a Sysadmin, but
quickly discovered that programming
could help me solve a lot of the prob-
lems that I faced as a Sysadmin and I
ended up actually heading the program-
ming team at the place I worked.
So your first job got you into pro-
gramming, but how did you move
from general programming into, spe-
cifically, games?
Well, actually I got a call from [co-
founder of Media Molecule] Alex
Evans, who has been a friend of mine
for many years, saying that they were
looking for a server programmer. For
a while I was a little bit reluctant, be-
cause I knew the games industry was
famous for certain hours and practices
and so on and I was quite comfortable
in my financial services job. But, when
Alex explained what they were making,
and the whole concept behind LittleBig
Planet, I just had to give it a try and just
thought, ‘well, if I can do this then it’ll
just be fantastic!’
You mentioned that you initially had
quite a lot of preconceptions that it
was long hours and not necessarily
good pay. Has your view changed?
Do you still think it’s long hours and
poor pay?
We do sometimes work some long
hours but we try to keep that to an abso-
lute minimum. Really, we see that as a
sign of poor planning, so it’s not some-
thing that we build into the schedule. I
have been pleasantly surprised by
the [post-release] crunch: at
least, with LittleBigPlanet 2
I was pleasantly surprised
by the crunch but with
LittleBigPlanet we did
have quite a nasty
crunch period. I think it probably goes
with the territory of smaller studios
that there’s just less of everything and
more to do. So overall, I think my view
has changed in the sense that the better
you manage your planning, and the bet-
ter you manage your project, the more
you’re able to deliver what you want to
deliver in the time available. It’s a kind
of discipline – to deliver great stuff in
the time available rather than trying to
squeeze ever more stuff into ever di-
minishing time slots.
So now you’re in the games industry,
is it where you want to stay?
That’s a very good question. I am re-
ally interested in how technology can
bring people together, and how technol-
ogy can enable people to achieve things
that they were not necessarily able to
achieve before, or that they didn’t even
know were possible to achieve. And so
in that respect I would love to work in
anything where game mechanics apply.
Obviously, the first place to look for
that is the games industry, but there are
more applications of those kind of prob-
lems. With this whole emerging trend of
‘gameification’, I think a lot of people
are looking to game mechanics now to
inject a bit of dynamism into their prod-
uct experiences. On the other hand, it’s
not just about injecting dynamism, it’s
about injecting joy - for me - and it’s got
to be a genuine attempt to try and make
people’s lives more enjoyable, or better,
bring people together. So yes, the games
industry is one example where that hap-
pens a lot, and compared to a lot of the
other IT-type professions, there’s a high
incidence of that in games.
Now, being a physicist, as I well
know, although we do a bit
of programming, it’s not
really done very rig-
orously. We do pro-
gramming to “do
stuff”, we don’t
really look at the
fundamentals. Do you feel that was
something that hindered you, or do
you think it’s not really an issue?
No, I think the usual canard that’s used
is: in computer science things are done
rigorously and in industry programming
is just used to solve problems, to “do
stuff” as you said. In that sense, the kind
of programming that I learnt during
my physics degree was the same kind
of level of pragmatism: just “get stuff
done”. On the other hand, there are cer-
tain things that happen in professional
programming that don’t happen very
much in either the sciences or in com-
puter science. That’s things like how
software teams work together as teams,
how you plan stuff, how you deliver
stuff on time, how you make sure that a
build from three years ago is still build-
able, if you check it out from source
control - oh, did I mention, you should
