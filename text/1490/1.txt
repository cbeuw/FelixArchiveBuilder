Proposed changes would give
departments flexibility to set
classes during lunchtime
The current two-hour lunch break could
be abolished to allow departments more
flexibility in scheduling classes, accord-
ing to proposals from the College Day
Working Party. The Chair of the working
party, Professor Dorothy Griffiths, said
that departments would still be expected
to schedule a one-hour lunch break.
Changes would be made to umanities
timeslots to ensure that students are not
impeded from taking humanities classes
by lunchtime lectures or labs. Under the
proposals extra timeslots would be cre-
ated on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday
evenings from 17:00–19:00. Deputy
President (Education) Alex Dahinten,
who sits on the working party, reassured
Union Council on Monday 6th June that
students with club or society activities
that clashed with their humanities class-
es would be accommodated on a ‘one-
on-one’ basis where possible.
The proposals also include relatively
minor changes to exam timeslots. In-
stead of morning or evening exams, there
would be three timeslots: 09:00–12:00,
12:00–15:00, and 15:00–18:00. Dahinten
assured Union Council in his report that
there would not be more than two exams
per day and that ‘exams will not be in
succession’ under the proposals. Profes-
sor Griffiths said that students would not
be expected to take a late exam followed
by an early exam the next morning, but
she added the caveat that “in depart-
ments which offer a lot of choice and
have complicated exam schedules” these
guidelines may be breached. She em-
phasised that this would only happen in
rare circumstances and that it would be
for departments to work with individual
students in those cases. Also, Saturday
exams would be allowed in exceptional
circumstances – the example given is
the eruption of the Icelandic volcano
Eyjafjallajökull last year that caused dis-
ruption to the exam schedule. Professor
Griffiths made clear that Saturday exams
“will not be a regular feature of exam
schedules” and that the need to use the
Great Hall would not be a good enough
justification for Saturday exams.
The proposals are a response to the
growing difficulty of timetabling class-
es due to limited space on campus. In
January this year departmental adminis-
trators spoke of the need for more flex-
ibility in the timetable to allow them to
give students more choice and reduce
the congestion in timetables. Professor
Julia Buckingham told Felix that the
College is “approaching a limit on the
teaching space available for all the ac-
tivities undertaken day to day”.
Earlier proposals to extend the Col-
lege day in the morning and evening
were dropped after widespread opposi-
tion from students and staff.
The College is also working to make it
easier for departments to book rooms in
other departments as part of their efforts
to ease the pressure on timetables. There
won’t be any changes to the College day
next year, if passed the proposals would
be implemented for the 2012/2013 aca-
demic year at the earliest.
