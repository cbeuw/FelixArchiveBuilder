Come along, just for a few
minutes, and help us set
our agenda for the next
five years! We have some
questions that we need
you to answer so we can
be sure we are making
your time at Imperial the
best it can be.
Do you know someone who has done
an outstanding job as a representative?
A club or society member? someone
involved in welfare support? or a really
good events organiser? The Union awards
outstanding individuals each year; any
student can nominate someone and
we are accepting nominations from
now unti June 1. There are thousands
of volunteers working in all parts of
the Union from clubs and societies to
representation and we believe those
who have gone over and above what is
expected of them should be recognised.
The awards are:
• Union Colour
• Outstanding Service Award
• Imperial College Union Fellowship
with Distinction
For someone to win an award they have
to be nominated by any Full member of
the Union (any student at Imperial) and
then the Colours Committee considers
the nominations. Nominations will close
on 1 June so make sure you get yours in
early! Nominate online.
Last chance to nominate!
Nominations close 1
June.

Positions up for grabs:
Elections 2011
The GSA organises events and
representation for all 6,000+ graduate
students at Imperial. This means we’re
looking for people with a wide range
of skills - from organising PG Mingles
and social events, to those interested
in helping their fellow students through
representation & advice.
There are many positions available,
from GSA President to Treasurer,
Secretary, Academic & Welfare Officers
and more.
For a full description of each position,
go to the Union website. If you
have any questions about any of the
positions, or would like to learn more
about the GSA, please email the current
President, Deena Blumenkrantz, on
gsa.president@imperial.ac.uk.
If you’re new to the GSA and not sure
what time commitment you’re willing to
make, don’t worry - we’re all PGs too!
The Union is committed to supporting
the GSA with staff time & resources,
and we want to make sure that PGs
can contribute without jeopardising
their research or study. Taking part
in the GSA is a great way to build up
the postgraduate community here at
Imperial - and it can have benefits for
you personally too.
Nominations open on Monday May
23 and close on Monday June 6.
The election will be held online from
Monday June 13 to midnight on Sunday
June 18.
Who can stand? Any current
postgraduate and all final year
undergraduates who will be
postgraduates here next year can stand
for positions.
Who can vote? All current
postgraduates, all final year
undergraduates with accepted offers
for postgraduate study at Imperial and
everyone standing for a position can
vote.
