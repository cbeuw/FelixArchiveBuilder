H
ey! I’m Say! To get
straight to the point,
what I care most pas-
sionately about is for there to be
greater unity between all faith
societies. I am in my second
year, and over the last year I
have had the privilege of sitting
on the Interfaith Committee, and
have seen it grow from strength
to strength. This year, I would
like to go one step further, and
use the experience I have gained
to be Interfaith Officer.
Interfaith is still relatively
new, so for those of you who
don’t know so much about it,
Interfaith is formed by a com-
mittee of members from all the
different faith societies, and aims
to promote religious understand-
ing, dialogue and cultural toler-
H
ello, I’m Chris Socha,
a second year ISE stu-
dent, and I am running
for the role of LGBT Officer.
I’ve always been concerned
with LGBT issues (local, na-
tional and global), and have
been very involved in Impe-
rial’s LGBT society IQ (I’ve
been re-elected as Events of-
ficer for next year). Through
this role I have learnt that while
the majority of Imperial is very
‘LGBT friendly’, it can some-
times be difficult for fresh-
ers who are not ‘out’, or who
face abuse & ‘banter’ which
can make them feel unsafe
(whether physically, or emo-
tionally) in their own home. It’s
also unfortunately too easy for
people to forget about the 4th
Y
ou all know someone at
Imperial who is part of
the LGBTQ commu-
nity. You might not know it, but
you do. At some point in their
lives they are very likely to be
the victim of homophobic or
transphobic bullying or abuse.
We need do everything we can
to ensure that this is not the
case at Imperial, and as much
as possible to safeguard against
occurrences in the wider world.
The LGBTQ community en-
compasses a broad range of
people and identities. I want
to make sure all of us are rep-
resented - whether with a com-
forting reply to an email, by set-
ting up better communications
between the different groups
there for LGBT students and
ance on campus. WHY ME?
– As Hindu Society Interfaith
Representative, I have helped
organise events aimed at all
faith groups within Imperial
– Having participated in stu-
dent shows Mega Maalai (Trea-
surer) and East Meets West, I
have gained an insight into pro-
moting a large event to a multi-
cultural student body
– I consider myself to be ap-
proachable so I can take all your
issues to the Welfare Board
MY PLANS?
– Increase awareness of Inter-
faith across campus
– Organise more events in-
volving members of different
beliefs and societies – eg. Multi-
society football tournament
– Have atheists and agnos-
tic committee members, so more
views can be represented.
I believe that I have the skills,
experience and vision to religious-
ly lead the Interfaith Committee…
(no pun intended)! Please vote Say
for Interfaith Officer!

students to know that there is
someone in the union willing
to help!
If elected, I will:
• Continue to ensure that
there is no discrimination based
on sexual orientation or gender
identity in the union, college or
in halls.
• Work with ICU’s LGBT so-
ciety to provide awareness and
support for LGBT students
• Work with the union and
halls staff to make halls a safe

ing discrimination or difficul-

We need to make sure the in-
formation on the union website
is kept up to date, with clear
contact details for the LGBT
Officer and links to appropriate
support channels.
We are lucky that it is rela-
tively easy to live openly as an
LGBT person at Imperial. As
LGBT officer, I would fight to
make it as easy as possible.
KIRSTIN HAY
LGBT Officer
Interfaith Officer
I
’m from Singapore, a coun-
try of FOUR national lan-
guages with a population
more diverse than that of our
college. Back home, the con-
cerns of the various communi-
ties are handled with utmost
care and their differing views
are constantly taken into account
in decision-making. It is my be-
lief that international students
in college deserve such levels
of representation too. Our con-
cerns, which include issues with
visa applications and language
support programmes, should be
regularly brought to attention.
With your support, I will also
ensure that the relevant briefings
for non-UK students are held
to allow for a smooth transition
from life abroad to living on
D
o you know who your
Departmental Dis-
ability Liaison Officer
is? Did you know you that you
have one? If you had a learn-
ing disability, would you know
about it? Imperial does a lot for
its students with disabilities, but
there’s a lot more that can be
done to make life easier and fair-
er for our students. I’m a student
in Biology and have served as
Deputy President (Welfare) this
year. I’ve seen our disability pro-
vision from both sides – I know
what students are and aren’t
aware of and the next steps that
need to be taken to improve. As
Deputy President this year I’ve:
- Established a good working
relationship with College dis-
ability services
A
s a disability officer I
would be required to
ensure that all students
with disabilities, diagnosed or
undiagnosed spend their time
at the college as pleasant as
possible. Having a mother and
a cousin diagnosed with light
and severe level of disabil-
ity respectively, I have spent a
considerable amount of my life
caring or being in contact with
someone that requires that extra
care. It is something that is very
close to my heart and a very
significant topic for me. If I am
elected to this position I shall
do my best to promote the facil-
ities and help that are available
to disabled students and ensure
that the infrastructure is there to
support them.
campus. I also propose to:
1. Introduce an Online Portal
This will serve as a channel
through which prospective in-
ternational students can com-
municate with their respective
seniors. The website will also
serve as a means for interna-
tional students to provide feed-
back on the admissions process
and related issues, which will
then be highlighted to the Col-
lege’s International Office.
2.IncreaseInteractionamongst
the International Societies
Having served as the treasurer
for the Singapore Society, I have
seen the benefits of mingling
amongst the different commu-
nities at Imperial. For instance,
attending one another’s stage
productions allow for greater
awareness of the common concerns
faced. If elected, I will thus actively
liaise with the OSC and the over-
seas societies’ presidents to facili-
tate greater interaction amongst the
international student community.
So VOTE for HAO YI!!!!.
HAO YI GAN
- Improved on last year’s Dis-
ability Survey and continued
holding disability focus groups
for our students
- Championed Imperial adopt-
ing the DisabledGo scheme,
which empowers disabled stu-
dents by enabling them to see the
access features of every building
on campus via a user friendly
website before they travel here
Next year I hope to improve
upon what we offer students by:
- Introducing a disabil-
ity awareness session into the
Freshers’ induction programme
to make students more aware of
the disabilities they may have
and the support available
- Continuing to push for bet-
ter access to buildings across
our campuses
- Maintaining the feedback
mechanisms already in place and
establishing myself as a friendly
point of contact to make this even
more effective, as well as continu-
ing to follow up proactively on
feedback to effect real change
CHARLOTTE IVISON
I am familiar with the support
and services that are currently
on offer and think that they
are a great asset to the college.
However, I do have some of my
own views on how they could
be improved. What I may seem
to lack in experience at face
value, I more than make up in
passion and determination. If
you give me this chance to rep-
resent the disabled people in
the college, I promise to devote
substantial amount of time, ef-
fort and resolve to this role. I
wish to thank you again for tak-
ing your time to read my mani-
festo and please do contact me
with any queries you may have.
