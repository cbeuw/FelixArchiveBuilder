G
oogle – a name we all
know. I’m sure that the
majority of you use one
of the internet giant’s ser-
vices on a near-daily ba-
sis. They of course burst into popularity
with the now almost ubiquitous search
engine, and have since made inroads
into many areas of our digital lives. So
their annual Google I/O event would
usually have technology buffs salivat-
ing over what exciting new technologies
may be announced. However, this year’s
event may not have been so widely an-
ticipated, especially with some of their
releases in the last couple of years hav-
ing a less than pleasing reaction.
A fading edge
Firstly there was Google Wave – an
online, real-time collaborative commu-
nication/editing tool that was first an-
nounced at I/O two years ago. It didn’t
seem to me to really bring anything to
the table – I couldn’t really see a real-
world application for it. But everyone
was raving about Wave – initial reac-
tions to the service were positive, with
invitations to the beta incredibly popu-
lar. However, it soon became evident
that there was little to do once the initial
hype had passed, and Google failed to
come up with a solid use. To this end,
Google announced just over a year later
that development on the service had
ceased due to lack of interest.
Secondly, a little over a year ago,
came the infamous Google Buzz. The
social networking and messaging tool
came under fire almost immediately due
to privacy concerns, with the first law-
suit coming just one week after Buzz’s
release.
Many users were outraged by some of
the default settings, which revealed peo-
ple they often emailed and automatical-
ly posted their current location. While
this was probably the main factor in the
service’s lack of success, it didn’t ap-
pear to have a unique or innovative fea-
ture to its name; instead it just seemed
to be attempting to rival Facebook. Ad-
ditionally it seems odd to me that Buzz
is mainly integrated with Gmail. Surely
if you’re logged into Gmail, your first
thought if you wanted to talk about or
share something with a contact would
surely be to email them?
Innovation lost
So why does it seem that the once
seemingly-untouchable Google started
to struggle? It cannot be ignored that
the company is huge, with over 26000
employees. With a business that large
comes an inevitable amount of bureau-
cracy. That in turn makes it more diffi-
cult for new, innovative ideas from non-
managerial employees to make it into
the world as a Google product.
For example, those ideas that origi-
nate in engineers’ twenty per cent time
(and Gmail was one of these) would
probably never make it past their com-
puters today.
On top of that, it’s possible that this
will have a knock-on effect on new ap-
plicants to the corporation – budding
new software engineers with idea-filled
heads may start looking elsewhere in
fear of not having their innovations
even considered.
More of the same?
But perhaps there is hope for Google
to shed their previous failures in the
newly announced products at this
year’s I/O. Although their Android
mobile operating system is success-
ful, it looks like they need another big
win to get rid of any negativity. So it’s
worth a look at the two main services
announced this year – Google Music
and Chromebooks – to see if they may
provide this boost.
First up is Google Music, an online
music streaming service with a bit of
a difference. Unlike existing services
such as Spotify and Grooveshark, you
can only stream music which you have
uploaded to Google’s servers. Although
the company is in talks with record la-
bels and wishes to release its own music
store, at the moment the invitation only
beta seems more like just a music stor-
age solution. And while you can cache
some songs for offline listening, you
cannot re-download any of the songs
you put up there, effectively tying you
into the service should you lose your
local copies of the tracks. From this, I
struggle to see why people would switch
from their current streaming provider.
The other main announcement this
year was Chromebooks – Google’s
coined name for netbooks running their
Chrome operating system. There don’t
seem to be problems with the software
itself – it sounds like it does what it’s
supposed to do quite well (as long as
you can work within its internet only re-
strictions) – but there doesn’t seem to be
a solid reason for people to move to the
new platform. Even the hardware might
be fighting a losing battle, as netbooks’
popularity has waned.
The main selling point Google seem
to be going with is the price, but even
with that there doesn’t seem to be much
of an advantage. The netbooks range
from $350 for the wi-fi version of the
Acer Chromebook, to $499 for the 3G
enable Samsung Series 5. To compare,
you can get an HP Windows 7 netbook
with a decent specification for $449. Al-
ternatively, Google is offering a month-
ly subscription based system, primar-
ily aimed at the business and education
sectors, with fees ranging from $20 to
$28 per month depending on the model.
These do come with a three year con-
tract however, and if you need 3G data,
you’re going to need to add $20 a month
for an extra 1GB to bolster the paltry
100MB included with the base cost. In
perspective, a three year contract with
the cheaper netbook and 1.1GB of 3G
data a month will cost $1440, which
isn’t very cheap.
So it seems that although their new
products have some interesting features,
the day may not yet quite be saved.
With Google trying to be dominant in
so many digital markets, perhaps even
spreading themselves too thinly, it’s
easy to forget the products that made
them famous. They may be starting to
lose their edge already, a dangerous pos-
sibility in such a fast moving sector.
