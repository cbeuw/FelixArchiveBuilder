H
i, my name is Yari Vo-
ropayev. I am a 2nd
Year undergraduate
student studying Material and
Nuclear Engineering. I am a
member of the Green Party and
have consequently participated
in several environmental proj-
ects. In recent years Imperial
has made significant progress
to be environmentally friendly,
however I believe much more
can still be done.
My goal is that Imperial
College London will be the
leading example of what can
be achieved when saving the
environment. Using our tech-
nological prowess, I want us to
be coming up with innovative
ideas that will make real differ-
ences regarding green issues.
H
ey guys, I’m Alan, a
2nd Year Physicist and
I want to represent you
as an Entertainments Commit-
tee Member.
I am very actively involved
with the union and want to see
it grow and improve. There are
many students who are not fond
of the union itself and do not
attend many of its organised
events - I want that to change.
The union should be a place
where you can expect to bump
into not only your classmates
and colleagues, but also friends
from other London universities
who have heard great things
about it.
The Summer Ball was a huge
talking point this year and I
am as curious as anyone to see
U
niversity is about more
than lectures, tutorials
and- eugh- revision.
Even moreso given the endless
opportunities London offers to
entertain and entice us and as
such, I understand the impor-
tance of fun and being enter-
tained whilst at Imperial. I’ve
always been happy to go to the
union with friends (often jump-
ing at the opportunity), sported
some ‘interesting’ costumes
and ran around central London
dressed as santa to raise money
for charity to name but a few.
I’ve been involved in every-
thing I can this year, from RAG
to societies, a variety of Dep-
Soc events to just sitting around
relaxing with friends.
It’s important that we im-
I aim to provide cost-effec-
tive solutions in reducing the
energy consumption levels at
Imperial. An example of this
would be to provide light sen-
sors around campus and mak-
ing sure that departments and
halls. From coordinating with
a STEP change ambassador,
I was personally involved in
conducting a number of assess-
ments and surveys evaluating
areas of improvement to in-
crease efficiencies and reduce
energy wastage. As a result I
am familiar with areas that need
considerable improvement in
which I hope to address should
I get elected. Also I have been
the Materials Department Year
Rep, this has augmented my
ability to represent a group in a
board and voice their concerns.

how it turns out. I hope it will
be a great success but, if it isn’t
and I am elected, I can assure
you that I will consult with as
many students as possible be-
fore making any new decisions
next year.
In terms of experience, I have
been elected ACC Vice-Chair
for next year which means I
will be in charge of the infa-
mous ACC Barnight and my
role as a hall senior in Beit hall
will allow me to be “in touch”
with the freshers.
Thanks!

prove our Union in any way we
can, and I’ve been elected as
BiochemSoc events officer and
have promised to ensure it’s a
fun and entertaining society,
and above all else I feel that the
philosophy of ‘time enjoyed is
never time wasted’ applies to
university and life in general,
and this is what I want to bring
to the entertainments commit-
tee.
If elected I will-
• Apply for work at the Union
Bar to stay in constant contact
with the goings-on and to see
how it’s going for students
• Be in regular contact with
the other committee members
and have frequent informal
meetings as well as the formal
ones to ensure the smooth run-
ning of the committee
• Write a termly Felix article
about events that term
• Ensure the committee is acces-
sible and easy to reach if anyone
has questions/wants some infor-
mation

mperial College is infa-
mous for its male to female
ratio, especially obvious in
the engineering departments.
This sex imbalance creates op-
portunities for potential sexual
discrimination and harassment,
which comes on top of already
stressful work environment.
I regard the main role of gen-
der equality officer to prevent
violation of the women’s rights
in the day-to-day university ac-
tivities (such as lectures, coffee
breaks and living in the library)
as well as in halls. Largely due
to introduction of the Gender
Equality Scheme at Imperial,
the number of sexism-related
issues has shown to be consis-
tently decreasing for the past
few years. I have talked to
H
i, I’m Joachim Dias,
2nd year undergradu-
ate in materials. I’m
running for Healthy living of-
ficer because I feel Imperial
doesn’t provide enough support
for students.
• I want to make Halal and
Kosher food available every-
where in Imperial because I
think everyone should have the
choice to eat what they want to
eat according to their religion.
• I will also try to make the
food quality of SCR available
for undergraduates, it’s not be-
cause you’re an undergraduate
that you can’t eat healthy food
but get the bad quality food of
JCR. Food quality needs to be
the same for everyone.
• Campaigns for drugs and
several female students from
various departments and none
have complaint regarding dis-
crimination, nor do any of the
male students surveyed. My
aim is to continue this positive
trend through: serving as a link
between students, the union and
organizations such as Women
in science, regulation of union-
activities and increasing ap-
proachability.
Some might wonder whether
a male student is suitable for
such position. Being a biology
student (one of the few depart-
ments where female students
make up the majority) as well
as a hall senior enables me to
keep up-to-date with female
perspective on the university
experience.

alcohol awareness will also be
launched as it is a major part of
student life and that needs to be
recognized rather than ignored.
People should know the risks
they take and always be sure
Imperial will provide help if
they need any, they shouldn’t
be scared of talking to someone
and taking the risk of being ex-
pelled.
• I will have the same attitude
towards sexual health, and have
STI tests available in Imperial
on a regular basis.
