FELIX Friday 27 may 2011 35
Scorpio
This week, you’re having a chat with
Satan.Thereareafewproblemswithyour
contract. It’s all fine except for the section
titled, “Eternal Anal Rape”. Apparently
you haven’t filled out the Health & Safety
documentation. Jeez, who knew selling
your soul was so bureaucratic...
Horoscopes
Aries
This week, you’re a married footballer.
You meet a saucy bit of skirt in a London
club and decide to take her back to a hotel
togiveheragoodinjunctionwithacouple
of your mates. You give your lawyer a
call on the way to the hotel; BAM! Your
cum is officially media-proof...
Taurus
This week, the Oprah show is coming to
an end. You’re so affected that you start
weeping in exams. When the inviligator
approaches to see what’s wrong, you
leap up out of your chair, stab yourself
in the groin with your pen and scream
“NOTHING CAN REPLACE HER!!!”
Gemini
This week, you take a copy of Felix
back home for your parents. After flick-
ing through it for a few minutes, your
mother stops and asks you who writes
the Horoscopes. You try the classic, “An
older editor made me do it” but it’s to no
avail. It’s back to therapy, again...
Cancer
This week, you’re wanking in the library
toilets when the battery on your iPhone
runs out. Damn, no more internet porn.
You scan the cubicle for stimulation;
nothing. The guy in the next cubicle
groans as he shits. ‘Groan? Or moan?’
you think... Aww yeah back in business.
Leo
This week, you’re taking a walk down
Memory Lane. Damn, things have
changed since you last visited. All the
shops have closed, there are gangs of fe-
ral ‘yobbos’ hanging around, and there’s
a guy in the corner shooting heroin. Wait,
Dad? (Oh, repressed memories...)
Virgo
This week, you decide to kill your house-
mates.It’snotadecisionthatyou’vecome
to easily or without due regard for the se-
riousness of your action. You’ve simply
come to the reasonable conclusion that
it’s NOT COOL TO EAT YOUR FUCK-
ING YOGHURT WITHOUTASKING...
Libra
This week, you’re having a beer in the
Union when a boy comes up and asks if
you would like a drink. You look at him
sexily and down your pint.You then stick
your fingers down your throat, throw up
your entire pint back into your glass, take
a sip and say “I would rather die...”
Sagittarius
This week, you’re on a date with a girl
when you decide the play the old “let’s
get you wasted” card. Singles become
doubles, doubles quickly turn into
triples and before long you’re wearing
a suit and tie and facing trial for date
rape... DAMMIT!
Capricorn
This week, you’re crying in your
bedroom over your ex-boyfriend. Yes,
it’s been a year now but you just want to
indulge in your emotions a bit. There’s a
knock on your door. Your ex-bf shouts,
“stop whining you bitch!” “Fuck you!
Move out already!” you shout back...
Aquarius
This week, the lecturer does something
extraordinary and unprecedented. He
walks up the aisle, bends down to
you, and nibbles your ear. You’re not
sure what to do, all you know that if
someone asks you stand up suddenly,
things might get a little awkward...
Pisces
This week, you decide to launch your rap
career by starting an impromtu rap battle
with the cashier in the JCR. “Yo check
my flow, give me my cash, don’t mess
wit my dough... yo!” He gives you your
change without saying anything. Yeh,
fucking coward. You OWNED bro!
DRUNKEN
MATE OF
THE WEEK
I’m sorry, are you seeing what I’m seeing? Is she sitting on a bundle of newspapers? Listen lady-who-thinks-it’s-
ok-to-sit-on-my-newspaper, if I ever find out who you are, I’m going to... give you a stern telling off! Hmph!
Fine I’ll admit, I’m turned on. Hey! Don’t judge! All I’m saying is that’s one fine ass. Ok he’s throwing up but who
hasn’t played with a little bodily fluid in bed? I mean it’s not scat or anything... Mmmm... scat... *drools
THE NEWS WITHOUT THE NEWS
This man is alleged
to have slept with
ex-Big Brother
contestant Imogen
Thomas
CENSORED
But because of an
EVIL injunction, we
can’t tell you how
long he lasted...
(We had a better
joke, but Giggs
took an injunction
out on it...)
