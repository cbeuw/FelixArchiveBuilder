In what was not a wholly un-
expected result, Trev Phillips was
elected to the post of President
of Imperial College Union for the
session 1974/75. In doing so he
had a landslide victory, polling
919 votes. This beat the previous
record held by the present Presi-
dent. Norm Sayles.
Jaqui Gerrard was elected as
Hon. Secretary and Ron Kill as
Deputy President. Also, as was
known to anyone who voted, Mike
Williams (after the stand down of
his opponent) became Felix
Editor/Publicity Officer.
Although the winner in the Pre-
sidential stakes was hardly ever
in doubt, the size of his win was
far beyond that which several'
pundits had been expecting. The
challenge by Phil Hemmens was
thought to be very strong, but it
just didn't materialise. Maybe
(without any ill-meaning) Mr,
Hemmens appealed to those
people who unfortunately find it
difficult to spend two minutes
casting their vote.
Throughout most of the elec-
tions held in the last fortnight
there has been a decided lack of
candidates. Most of the posts;
(officers and departmental repsj
have been uncontested. This has
led to there being quite a lot of
new (in the sense that they have
not been previously deeply in-
volved) faces on the Union Coun-
cil next year. Is this a sign that
there is going to be a completely
different attitude? Hopefully,
more of next year's Council will
take their positions seriously than
has been the case this year.
