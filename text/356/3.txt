NIGHTLINE
Here is an example of the way in which Im-
perial College manages to lead others up and
down the country.
28 February 1974 P A L A T I N A T E
L A T E R on this term Durham University's "Nig'htline" will
be starting up —
The first "Nig'htline" was started by Imperial College
in 'the late 'sixties, after a student there committed suicide.
The students were appalled by the fact that 'they could
live and learn together in their own community, and
yet still have amongst them someone so depressed, with no
one to turn to, who felt that their only option was to
Hake their own life. It was from Imperial College's example
that there has now grown up, in over 25 universities and
college organisations, not all called "Nightline", but all
•offering the same kind of service. They take many of their
techniques from the exampe set by the Samaritans and,
although encouraged by ithem, they exist as separate
•organisations — offering fundamentally, students who are
willing to listen and offer friendship to the student Who
$bones or calls in. Simply by listening, the student's prob-
lems can crystallize. Often no further action need be taken
«s they can now see their own way through their particular
•difficulties.
Computing at IC
Another CDC 6400 Computer for IC
IC will be obtaining a second C D C 6400 com-
puter for one year's free trial. The new machine
will be linked to the existing one, and it is en-
visaged that a 24-hour (365/6 day a year) ser-
vice will be provided. When the computer centre
is unstaffed, e.g. during holidays, a systems error
will stop processing. The new configuration will
support 192 terminals, which will triple the exist-
ing number.
If the plans for installation are followed, the
new service will commence at the beginning of
next session. The first year of usage is free
(as a result of the generosity of C D C ) . At the
end of the first year, the hire charge can be set
against the purchase price, and with further dis-
counts the cost becomes £356,000 (compared
with a list price of £552,000).
Any views on the computer centre's operation/
image?
At present a College working party is examin-
ing the image/effectiveness of the Computer
Centre at IC. Consequently, I would be very grate-
ful to hear from any users, with ideas of how
the Centre could be even better. Since a pre-
liminary report is shortly to be produced, I ask
you to contact me as soon as possible.
In addition, your opinions on the form of exist-
ing documentation (reference manuals, ICCC
bulletins, library routines, write-ups, etc.) would
be welcome. Suggestions of areas of computing
where documentation could exist will be particu-
larly useful.

The present trial
paper recycling scheme
in the Physics Building
is gathering momentum.
In the first week Eco-
Action collected 9 cwt.
and raised £9.69, fol-
lowed by approximately
16cwt. of which 11 \
have gone to the paper
mill raising £10.16
Since then, the rate of
collection has increas-
ed to nearly 2 tons per
week.
At the moment there
is a second department
intending to "give it a
try", so they are in need
of more volunteers pre-
pared to give up f
hour per week to push
trolleys loaded with
paper to the Southside
storeroom. If you are
interested, would you
please go to the ECO-
ACTION meetings at
7.30 p.m., Thursday eve-
nings, Southside Bar,
(upper level), or phone
Internal 2931 or 2937.
S * * *
Any person visiting the Students Union most morn-
ings will be greeted by scenes of indescribable filth.
Unlike the impression given on the cover of a recent
Guildsheet it is not clever to get drunk. Piss artists
should have no place at Imperial College, or any-
where else for that matter. Is it clever to stick paper
full of shit on a wall? Do students think it right to
mess in fire buckets and to vomit everywhere"? What
is far more important is: Is is fair to ask women
cleaners to clean up this appalling mess'? The image
of students, not only Norman Sayles, but everyone
at College is at risk. None of us wishes to see the
good relations now existing between students and
workers at IC destroyed by a group of students
devoid of any form of decency.

The above is a straight crib from the "Action
News", I.C. NUPE newsletter. I don't think any
more need be said.
F A S T
As pre-reported in the
last issue, a fast took
place last week. This
was undertaken by 15
members of the college
branch of Amnesty Inter-
national, a body whose
main concern is the poli-
tical prisoners in coun-
tries around the world.
They work a system
whereby each group
"adopts" upwards of
three prisoners and
works for their release
and also raises money
for families and rela-
tives. Most of the mem-
bers who took part in the
fast were sponsored (for
so much per hour fast-
ing) and some raised up
to £50 by fasting for 72
hours. A total of nearly
£200 was raised in this
manner, plus at least a
further £20 from dona-
tions.
Also, as part of their
demonstration, a cage,
similar in size and shape
to those used by several
governments as cells for
the prisoners, was plac-
ed outside the Southside
main entrance and dur-
ing the refectory hours,
several of those on the
fast remained in there,
giving an indication of
the cramped and in-
humane conditions that
the prisoners have to
suffer.

NUS put in
grants claim
The first thing the
National Union of Stu-
dents did when Mr. Reg
Prentice was named as
Education Secretary was
to send off their grants
claim.
While not exactly en-
amoured of Mr. Prentice,
the union think there will
be more co-operation
during talks on the claim
for a £655 minimum
grant. Mr. Steve Parry,
the union's national sec-
retary, said Mr. Prentice
would have to fight to
get the Labour Party's
policies on education
implemented.
"We are certainly
pleased to get rid of
Mrs. Thatcher," Mr.
Parry said. "I hope he
doesn't attack the Left
in the student movement
in the same way as he
has attacked the Left in
the trade union move-
ment."
LOW GRANTS DETER"
SAYS VICE-CHANCELLOR
Large numbers of students might
be put off from going to university
because their grants are too low, says
Dr. Harry Pitt, vice-chancellor of
Reading University.
The falling off in demand for high-
er education, together with competi-
tion among universities, polytechnics
and colleges of education for stu-
dents and resources, could produce
a "national problem which is both
grave and absurd", he sold the annual
meeting of the university's court.
"We may well be at a point where
substantial numbers of potential stu-
dents are deterred from entering uni-
versity by purely financial difficulties
and this at a time when they could
be absorbed at a very small marginal
cost.
"It is now generally accepted that
the grant is now, and has been for
several years, less than required to
cover a student's living costs, even at
a minimal level.
"The so-called Anderson Principle
has, therefore, already been breached
and it is plain that the present genera-
tion of students will be at a dis-
advantage in comparison with their
predecessors and that many of them
will have real difficulty in bridging the
gap between their expenses and their
income."
Statements like this are very wel-
come, especially in view of the fact
that there is a new Government.
Hopefully Reg Prentice, the new
Minister, will take note of Dr. Harry
Pitt.
