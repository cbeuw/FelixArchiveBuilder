Dep Reps
Council voted over-
whelmingly for a Com-
puting and Control Dep
Rep to be elected at the
beginning of the 1974/
75 session.
Mike
Mr. Lolley reported
that he had found Mike
in a cupboard in the
Mines department.
Letter from University
College
This referred to dam-
age reportedly done by
the IC Rugby Club. It
was decided to write a
letter of apology but not
to send any money.
Nightline
Mr. Maynard, the
Nightline co-ordinator,
had resigned and there
was some discussion on
different proposals con-
cerning the implementa-
tion of a sabbatical post.
It was agreed to defer
this to the next council,
pending further investi-
gation.
Elections
It was agreed that
people manning the bal-
lot boxes should be paid
£1.25 per session. Those
students receiving free
accommodation should
not however be paid.
Synthesiser
The cost of an elec-
tronic synthesiser had
risen considerably and
there were no longer any
models available for hire.
Further enquiries will be
made into the possibility
of buying a kit.
Floor Reps Ctte
Council agreed with
the committee's recom-
mendations that (1) The
executive should present
full minutes of their
meetings to Council. (2)
That Union meetings
should be held in the
Great Hall. (3) That the
Exec should be present
at least ten minutes be-
fore the advertised start
of a General Meeting.
(4) That Council should
reaffirm its decision to
call speakers at Union
Meetings 'Mr. Speaker'
instead of by their
names. (5) That motions
for Union meetings
should be posted on
notice boards for seven
days before the meeting.
Room Bookings
There was some dis-
cussion on the question
of room bookings, espe-
A S I T W A S
daily with regard to a
new booking form that
had been in operation for
most of the academic
year. It was agreed that
'The withholding of a
deposit shall be consid-
ered in the same way as
a disciplinary offence,
i.e. a student has the
right to go before an
Appeals Committee'.
Student Radio
Council supported, in
principal, the setting up
of a student radio. Fur-
ther reports will be made
after approaches to the
relevant College officers.
Honour Boards
It was agreed that
these should be fixed
permanently in place.
IMUS Delegation
John Porter's motion
"Council notes that the
election of the N U S dele-
gation was carried put
according to the booklet
" H o w to conduct an
election by S T V " pro-
duced by the Electoral
Reform Society, and not
by the voting schedule in
the Blue Book" was car-
ried. It was agreed to let
the vote stand but to use
the I.C. voting schedule
in future elections.
March 19, 1954 Rugby
The Rugby Cup has
come back safely to the
Old Lounge after its
annual excursion to Mot-
spur Park. The result at
the final whistle was Im-
perial College 3 pts
LSE 0.
March 18, 1964
007
Two copies of lan
Fleming's latest James
Bond novel, " Y o u only
live twice" were added
to the Haldane library on
Monday.
Buddy Holly
I was amazed at the
poor taste shown by the
writer of the second
Juke Box Jury sketch at
last week's smoking con-
cert. I refer to the carry-
ing of Buddy Holly's
"coffin" across the stage
as a "personal appear-
ance.
Most of the audience
seemed to think this
highly funny, but it and
the beer marred for me
an otherwise reasonably
enjoyable evening.
Pedal Cars
Guilds competed in
the annual Pedal Car
race at Bristol. It was
soon obvious that we had
the fastest cars but we
hadn't bargained for the
number of crashes this
would involve us in. Ken
Oldfield broke the lap
record by 13 seconds,
bringing it to 59.8 sec-
onds. At midnight we
were positioned 16th and
17th, and at the finish
5th and 6th.
March 20th, 1974
At the last meeting of
the Residence Commit-
tee, it was decided to in-
crease Hall rents by 20
per cent from the begin-
ning of next session.
Constitution
The eagerly awaited
IC Union meeting to dis-
cuss the proposed con-
stitutional r e f o r m s
opened last Thursday.
About 430 students
packed into Mech Eng
220 and in a meeting las-
ting nearly three hours
voted in a number of im-
portant constitutional
changes. After throwing
out the council document
the meeting based dis*
cussion on the original
working party report. It
was decided to elect the
President, Deputy Presi-
dent and Secretary by a
college-wide ballot and
the size of council was
increased by the additioa
of 11 departmental reps
and an Academic Officer.
