Queen II
Queen are the group with college
connections. However, with this latest
album, "Queen II", it is very unlikely
that they'll ever need to have connec-
tions with their previous vocations
again.
They appeared in a big way, some
time ago, with their first album,
'Queen'. This received rapturous
acclaim from most critics and their
latest album has been long awaited.
The album has a new concept.
There is no side one or two. Instead
there is a black side and a white side.
The white side is written by Brian
May (guitarist, B.Sc. (Physics)—Im-
perial College, Ph.D. student, infra-
red astronomy) with a track by Roger
Taylor (drums). The black side is
written by Freddie Mercury (vocals,
fashion designer). The fourth mem-
ber of the band is John Deacon (bass,
B.Sc. (electronics)). Brian and Roger
Frse Story
What can I say that hasn't been
said before. In five years of existence
Free created the kind of music that
should have earned them the recogni-
tion that's been afforded to the
Stones, Cream, Hendrix, ELP, Led
Zepplin, etc. Why they never got it
I'll never know. This album only goes
to enhance my belief that in the last
decade Free have proved themselves
to be amongst Britain's Top Bands,
and their final split is a loss to the
whole music business. The album
traces Free's history from the first
album, 'Tons of Sobs' way back in
"68 through the two splits to the
'Heartbreaker' album. It's hard to give
an accurate picture of the band's
music in just 20 tracks when you've
got 6 albums worth to choose from.
Even so Island have done a great job
and there will be few people who
would disagree with their choice of
tracks. Every track is a gem and the
album's a classic. Whilst this album
does go a long way to tracing Free's
history it will never replace most
people's memories of the band, mem-
ories gained at exciting and near
riotous live gigs.
Whilst Free never captured their
live sound in studio recordings, they
did leave us some very fine music on
record. 'All Right Now" is an obvious
example of this and its success in
1970 along with that of the album
Tire and Water' should have heralded
the beginning of better things for
Froe. However, the relative flop of the
originally were in Smile and Queen
developed from them.
The record has to be heard to be
believed. Brian's guitar work is such
that they print on the album sleeve
"and no-one played synthesiser . . .
again." For a newcomer to Queen
this is necessary. The range of sounds
that Brian produces are beyond de-
scription and defy comparison with
previous material.
The production of the record is
also a top class piece of work. To
listen on mono equipment would be
a sheer injustice. Full use has been
made of the fact that stereo records
can carry different information in the
two channels.
Hopefully, their management will
take note of the fact that the gig they
did here last term was probably the
turning point in their career, and will
acknowledge this with the offer of a
Great Hall gig next term. If this hap-
pens then don't miss them.
In the meantime, beg, steal, borrow
or even buy a copy of " Q U E E N II"
and remember the following quote
"Queen are set for the big, big time.
And nothing—but nothing—is big
enough to stop them."
follow-up single 'The Stealer' and the
depressing sales of the album 'High-
way', signalled the beginning of the
end for Free. Bewilderment within the
band about why the follow-ups
flopped caused discontentment be-
tween its four members. The band
were just round the corner from be-
ing extremely big yet they themselves
were disillusioned by the seemingly
never-ending work they'd have to do
to achieve this success. Personal dif-
ferences built up and led to the origi-
nal split. After going their own indi-
vidual ways, without much success,
the band reformed, cut the fine album
Free at Last' and started touring. Bad
luck dogged them yet again, and Paul
Kossoff's ill health and the concerts
consequently cancelled helped to
enlarge the still present personal dif-
ferences, which precipitated the sec-
ond split. With a completely different
line up Free returned, for a while, but
it just wasn't the same band.
Paul Rogers, Paul Kossoff, Andy
Fraser and Simon Kirke will be re-
membered individually and collective-
ly for the magnificent music they pro-
duced during the five years of Free;
but it is very sad to see Island limiting
the production of this Record Set
commemorating their work to 50,000.
Try and get hold of a copy if you
haven't got all the Free albums, it's
very good listening and well worth
the money.

Earnest
The Shaw Theatre is a really ex-
cellent place. Comfortable seats with
plenty of leg-room, tasteful decor and
friendly staff. It is mainly directed at
a young audience (e.g. normal price
£1.30 and 70p but the £1.30 tickets
cost only 50p to all students and any-
one under 21).
The latest production, performed
by the Dolphin Theatre Company, is
Oscar Wilde's "The Importance of
Being Earnest." Mr. Peter James,
director, is presenting here a play
that rarely manages a showing in
London nowadays.
The directing, however, leaves
much to be desired. Although not in
the classification of "Upper Class"
myself, it is obvious that a gentleman
of the standing of Mr. Algernon Mon-
crieff (Terry Taplin) would never
speak with his mouth full of cucum-
ber sandwiches. What is more no such
gentleman would maintain such an
activity. Nor would he bellow: a
gentleman's tone is seemly.
To convert Lady Bracknell (Betty
Marsden) into a throbbingly tremu-
lous Lady, whose cry out "a hand
bag" is merely that of pain, is wrong:
Lady Bracknell is here a slightly sev-
ere romantic and the young ladies,
Gwendoline (Polly Adams) and Cecily
(Louise Purnell) are hardly the dec-
orously lethal things they should be.
To comment on the dialogue of
such a well-known play would be use-
less. It is, however, amusing and the
actors (despite the poor directing) do
try to put over the upper class Vic-
torian attitude. Recommended, es-
pecially in view of the excellent ticket
price reduction.

THE COMPLETE CHRONICLES
OF N A R N I A — C . S. LEWIS
(These can be bought boxed for about
£1.65, or individually for about 30p
each).
Many people have read Tolkein's
"The Hobbit" and "Lord of the
Rings," not so many, perhaps, are
familiar with the writings of Tolkein's
close friend and associate. Professor
C. S. Lewis. Lewis was a prolific
writer, his writing covering many
areas; science fiction, philosophy and
literary criticism to name but a few.
He also, however, wrote a series
known as the Narnia Chronicles which
are similar in type to the "Lord of the
Rings" although the Narnia books are
avowedly allegorical. The Narnia
Chronicles comprise seven books:
"The Lion, the Witch and the Ward-
robe," "Prince Caspian," "The Voy-
age of the Daan Treader," "The Sil-
ver Chair," "The Horse and his Boy,"
"The Magician's Nephew" and "The
Last Battle."
These books cover the history of
Narnia from Creation to Apocalypse
and as well as being rattling good
yarns, they contain some profound
philosophical and metaphysical com-
ment. In my recent experience, these
books are becoming very popular in
the same way that "Lord of the
Rings" became popular. I can recom-
mend these books as very interesting,
enjoyable and entertaining reading.

Exorcist
A lot has been written about "The
Exorcist", not all of it particularly
complimentary. It has been variously
described as boring, horrific, strong
and (my favourite) " . . . a nasty little
film."
Going to the preview last week I
wasn't quite sure whether I had made
the right decision or not. Also, for
in the wrong place,
the first few minutes I thought I was
The film is about the demonic pos-
session of a 12-year-old girl. The slow
beginning (in fact it takes nearly half
the film) is spent in giving a family
background to the girl. Once the
possession starts, great use is made
of short scenes. These alternate
between sevaral associated locations
and the girl's bedroom. It works
on keeping the audience guessing
what will be the next horrific happen-
ing on return to the bedroom.
Amongst these are masturbaition with
a crucifix, the spewing of thick, green
vomit, more obscenities, than I care
to mention and the rotation of the
girl's head through a full 180
degrees.
The build-up to the actual exorcism
is somewhat slow and a triffe over-
done though the acting of the leading
players is very good. The exorcism
arrives, and a [though the main out-
come is never in doubt, there is a
strange, unexpected result.
The actual effects are well done,
and the make-up of the possessed
girl's face excellent.
I would not class this film as even
remotely approaching a classic. It
is, without doubt, a very powerful
and much above average horror flim,
but that is as far as it goes No
profound theological arguments, just
plain shock.
See it by all means, but be careful
what you eat and drink before going.
