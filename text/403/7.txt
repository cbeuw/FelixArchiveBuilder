PROFILE: JOHN DOWNS, h
by Mike Williams
JOHN MICHAEL DOWNS is probably the tallest person
ever to hold the office of Imperial College Union Honorary
Secretary. He is alleged to stand 6 * 5 " tall ("...but it's
usually 6 * 3 " 'cos I slouch."). As I watched him approach
the door to the office where I was furiously scribbling
notes for this profile, I paused and began to fear for the
doorframe. However the impending collision was averted
as the 6 ' 3 " prototype cut in with split-second timing.
"Instinctive slouching," I mused. "Incredible".
Zodiacatly anomalous at Secretary of the Union for"
birth (ie he was born February
19th 1954 which i s on the
cusp of Aquarius and P i s c e s )
John grew up (and up) at
Deeping St James which is
ten miles north of Peterborough
in L i n c o l n s h i r e . H e . was
actually born however, quite
short on a farm situated on the
highest h i l l (Barden H i l l to
be precise) in Leicestershire.
John arrived at IC in
October 1972 and studied
Materials Science in RSM for
three years during which
time he had become connected'
with various forms of enter-
tainment. After lots of rag
collecting in h i s first year, fie
became chairman of the Tizard
Hall Entertainments Committee
the following year. In h i s
third year he was the Carnival
Coordinator and a l s o organised
the successful revival of
Mines Revue. John has been
a member of Dramsoc ever
since he first came here and
is this year appearing in the
Christmas production of
" T h e Captain of K o p e n i c k " .
H i s final year saw him
successfully complete h i s
degree c o u r s e . w i t h a ' 2 . 1 '
and, more significantly, he
stormed home in tbe IC
Union elections gaining over
65% of the votes cast to
become the Sabbatical H o n .
this s e s s i o n .
John appears to be quite"
unaffected by the dizzy
" h e i g h t s ' ' commonly associated
with the post. When he
speaks, he is quite open and
genuine, not graspingly
cautious s o as to appear to
be giving nothing away. H i s
frankness and impish sense
of humour which keeps the
Union office buzzing merrily
ensures that the pose is
neither c o n t r i v e d nor
pretentious.
What do you hope to
achieve in your year as Hon.
Sec?
" I would just like to see
a lot more people aware of the
Union really. Most of the
students here use the Union
and yet a lot of them seem not
to be aware of It. They seem
to take it for granted and
that's a p i t y " .
Do you think Council is
too large?
(Long pause for serious
thought). " N o t too b i g , rather
more too inefficient. I think it
could function perfectly well
if the dedication was there
from a l l its members. Never-
theless, I wouldn't want to
see it any b i g g e r , "
What is your attitude to
NUS?
" I feel that it does not
Mutters Arising
The last " M u t t e r s " was a
joke article. I would not be
suprised to find this under
'Cross-country' or 'Rugby',
(very f u n n y - E d . ) , but here
goes:-
Floor reps
Last Mutters, I went into
raptures over the roles these
people play. The Editor
obviously feels that anonymity
is their strong point, a s he
refused to, print the names.
(Acomplete oversight; honest —
Ed.) So, for the second time of
asking, the floor reps are:-

Formal Dinners
The Union, and come to
that, the College authorities,
seem to be unclear as to
whether formal d o ' s are V A T -
able. We have now come to
the understanding that formal
dinners at which no entertain-
ments (ie cabaret, band, disco,
etc) are provided, are exempt
from V A T . Otherwise, V A T
w i l l be charged. I hope the
situation is now clearer.
Haldane Library
The Union has this term
bought 64 pop records and 31
books. A complete list is
available from yours truly. Let
me reiterate that to get a
particular record or book into
the stock, you c a n fill in a
appear to cater for the welfare
of students as well as it
might. F o r many IC students.
It is only the N U S ' s p o l i t i c a l
wing that they see and so
they tend to regard the N U S
services such as E n d s l e i g h
with s u s p i c i o n . Personally,
I get the impression that the
NUS is just a machine for
suggestion form in the
Library. About 60% of the
records bought, for example,
are bought " o n s u g g e s t i o n " .
In addition, has anyone e l s e
noticed the Saddlers Wells
student reductions advertised
in the record library? Going to
the opera for 50p can't be
bad — for more d e t a i l s , go
to the Library.
Mutters has landed —
nothing e l s e needs to be
s a i d , so au revoir.

Would you go on an NUS
demo?
" Y e s , I have done so and
would do so and would
encourage others to do

that demos do any harm.
Any last words?
