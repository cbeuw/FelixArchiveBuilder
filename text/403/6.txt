nearby.
At once, you telephone the Health Centre.
Priority!- but it may be 5 or 10 minutes until
expert help can arrive.
WHAT TO DO in that vital 10 minutes? WHAT
NOT T O DO? It is important that you should
know.

Society Games d r a w i n g ' t o a
close ICCS now looks forward
to its forthcoming events.
On Thursday 4th December
we shall be holding a s o c i a l
gathering in which we shall
sample the delights of a
home-cooked dinner, and
this w i l l be followed by a film.
The tickets are 75p for
members and 90p for non
members and may be obtained
from any committee member,
or from room 528, T i z a r d H a l l .
A menu has been proposed but
anyone who has a suggestion
or who would like to try their
hand in preparing their own
s p e c i a l i t y , please contact the
Committee. I would like to
stress also that a l l members
of this College, not only
Chinese members, are invited
to this Social gathering, a s
indeed they are to a l l functions
held by the Society.
We are now holding regular
meetings in room 606, E l e c
Eng building during Tuesday
lunchtimes. The meetings are
totally informal and tea is
served, so if you have any
suggestions, q u e s t i o n s ,
complaints or if you just
want a friendly chat then
come along — non members
are welcome too.
A s mentioned in the
previous article, we s t i l l
have posts vacant on the
Committee. Owing to the
registration of C K T s e , the
jobofSecretary i s n o w a v a i l a b l e ,
in addition to the previous
vacancies for about 3 general
committee members. Every
nominee will require a proposer
and two seconders and elections
will take place at the next
General Meeting.
Thus, if there is anything
you wish to enquire of, or if
you have not yet joined the
Society and cannot find a
committee member, just pop
in to one of our lunchtime
meetings. Whether C h i n e s e ,
E n g l i s h or any other nationality
we are your Society for the
promotion of C h i n e s e Culture
and thus depend • upon your
participation.

'Imperial Cooks'
I am happy to be able to tell everyone, particularly those
who helped the IC Wives' C l u b to promote Imperial Cooks,
that the profits from its sale have provided a large freezer
and some furniture for our Day Nursery.
There are s t i l l a number of things that are needed for the
children and plenty more books are on sale at the Bookshop,
the Haldane Library, 170 Queen's Gate, and the P u b l i c a t i o n s
Office (Sherfield 505). At the modest price of 60p (a
minimum — if you can spare a little extra we are very
grateful) it makes a wonderful Christmas present, and i t ' s
light and 'postable'. So buy a gift for a friend and the Day
Nursery at the same time!
