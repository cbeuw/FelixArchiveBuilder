W E L L S O C
Megalithic Mathematics
T H E W E L L S O C meeting on
November 24th heard a very
interesting lecture on the
geometry and astronomy of
Megalithic Monuments, given
by the noted expert in this
field, Prof. Alexander Thorn.
H i s lecture was concerned
mainly with the stone rings
of the late stone age, of which
there are 500 or s o good
examples in the U K , and
perhaps as many again in
Northern France.
He started by explaining
how these rings were laid out,
such that their principal
dimensions were integor
multiples of a unit of length
which he c a l l s the Megalithic
Y a r d . Other units he proposed
were the Megalithic R o d , of
2.5 Megalithic Yards, and the
Megalithic Inch equal to one-
fourtieth of the Megalithic
Yard. Numerous plans and
histograms illustrated h i s
point which culminated in an
intricate exploration of the
layout of Avebury ' c i r c l e ' .
The second part of h i s
lecture w a s devoted to the
astronomy of stone rings
and alignments. He showed
how the setting and rising
points of the s u n , moon and
certain stars at particular
times of the year were
accurately indicated by stone
alignments and distant
foresights. Further refinements
of these ideas showed how
Megalithic Man might have
known about the small
perturbation in the moon's
orbit, and hence may have
been able to predict e c l i p s e s .
Prof. Thorn indicated the
difficulty he experiences in
convincing the archaeological
community of the validity
of h i s theories. Judging by
the questions and d i s c u s s i o n
of the audience, it seems he
had little difficulty in
interesting those present from
the scientific community of
IC. T h e lecture w a s well
received but w a s marred by
lack of available time, and
the absence of a microphone.
References for those
interested are; " M e g a l i t h i c
Lunar O b s e r v a t o r i e s " , both
by a Thorn. F o r the real
addicts of the theory, papers
occur in the " J o u r n a l of the
History of A s t r o n o m y " .

O N E O F T H E main t a s k s for
IC P o s t Graduate Group has
always been the representation
of t h e special interests of
those registered for higher
degrees. Over the last three
years a number of separate
i s s u e s have been taken up
with varying degrees of
s u c c e s s . Now for the first
time there may w e l l be the
p o s s i b i l i t y of a broader
dialogue on the present state
of a l l kinds of post-graduate
activity. The establishment
of a college working party on
P G education which includes
three postgraduate students
in i t s membership i s a welcome
innovation. It w i l l be judged
on the b a s i s of any substantive
contribution to the educational
experiences of research and
advanced course students.
It i s important that the
channel of representation
provided by the post-graduates
on this working party carries
the maximum p o s s i b l e amount
of relevant opinion. A t this
stage the first priority i s to
generate a comprehensive
l i s t of the problem areas
arising in each kind of post-

graduate study. Some of the
matters for consideration
w i l l be quality of supervision,
the role of formal courses, time
scale of research and the use
of f a c i l i t i e s . In departments
where an active post graduate
group i s already established
representatives will be
arranging informal lunchtime
meetings early i n December.
There w i l l also be a meeting
open to a l l postgraduates on
2 D e c . at 1pm i n E l e c E n g 305.
T h i s will pro vide the opportunity
for those in departments where
groups are not yet operating
to specify the d i f f i c u l t i e s
they encounter.
The usefulness of the
working party to post graduate
students w i l l depend on the
s u c c e s s with which problem
areas are located.
