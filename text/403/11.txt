B Y O N E O ' C L O C K fifteen
players were assembled and
contemplating fourteen kits.
John Thomas had employed
the morning rag-collecting
and had contrived to get h i s
kit locked in the R S C Union
office. A scramble ensues.'.
Security guards were found
arid then lost again, and a l l
to no a v a i l , the Union office
remaining stubbornly locked.
We set off. John was hustled
on to the coach wearing h i s
lab coat, s t i l l clutching h i s
c o l l e c t i n g c a n and c o l l e c t i n g
only short change from the
rest of the team.
We arrived at E a l i n g ' s
ground and d i s m i s s e d our
coach, o n l y to discover
five minutes later that we
were in the wrong place and
needed it badly. However,
improvised transport w a s
soon rustled up in the shape
of Stan N i c h o l ' s exceedingly
small van into which umpteen
players and the supporters
club were crammed. A
; twenty-minute, breathtaking
race through E a l i n g left us
no shape to do anything, let
alone play rugby.
A -sprint through the park,
a rapid change, and we were
on the pitch by three o ' c l o c k :
but there w a s no sign of the
opposition. They soon turned
up and the game commenced,
the A ' s playing with their
backs to the setting sun.
It w a s soon apparent that
it w a s going to be a tough
game. The A ' s started w e l l ,
scoring an excellent try in
the first few minutes. The
ball went down tone backs,
C h r i s Becque taking a
difficult pass and feeding out
to J i m Pitcher who ran in
the try from a good thirty
yards out. E a l i n g were much
stronger in the pack, and in
our eagerness to overcome
that, we gave away a penalty
(or, at least, the referee
awarded a penalty in front of
our posts. It was converted.
The A ' s came back and
shortly before half time
scored a second try. Steve
Braund<. broke through anc
fed the ball to R i c h Jenner
who scored. That put the
A ' s 8.3 up at half time.
Unfortunately, o v e r -
confidence eroded s k i l l ,
and Ealincf were allowed
in to score a lucky try.
At theat point John Fishburn
narrowly missed with a
difficult k i c k . ' T h e turning
point w a s E a l i n g ' s second
try. R i c h P u l l e n who played
w e l l had to deal with a
high ball over our line. H e
tried to ground it but it bounced
.free and let E a l i n g i n . T h e
A ' s , demoralised, let E a l i n g
run i n another try to win 15—3.
T h i s w a s a game the A ' s
could have w o n . We suffered
from not having had a game
the previous week ( U C
failing to put in an appearance)
and from becoming over-
confident. We hope for a
better result next week.

Wasps II 32
IC 1ST X V put up a very
creditable performance on
Saturday 22nd November
before losing to a very strong
Wasps II team. After a
mistake by the backs had
given Wasps a gift try in the
1st minute: IC fought back
w e l l , pinning Wasps in their
own half with fine forward
play and t a c t i c a l k i c k i n g at
half back. Andy Devaney was
in form with is place kicking
and IC fought their way into a
9—6 lead, when another
defensive mistake gave Wasps
a second try. However IC
again responded well to the
challenge, and had their
captain not fluffed a simple
pushover try, they could have
been in a very strong position
at half time. A s it w a s , they
turned around 15—9 in arrears.
In the second half, the IC
forwards showed again and
again how much they have
improved in recent weeks,
both in the tight and in the
loose. However the Wasps
outside half, who had an
outstanding match, set them
up for two more tries, and
a score of 30—12, which
definitely d i d not do justice
to IC.
The forward play w a s
magnificent in a l l phases,
and apart from a few lapses,
the backs defended w e l l . With
an improvement in handling
I am confident that the team
w i l l really blossom. •
Team: Sorry folks as a number
of the names are not readable
we are not able to prim the
team.

L A S T F R I D A Y , Royal
Holloway C o l l e g e became I C ' s
first victims of the year at
swimming. Later on w e
finished off the job when
our second team beat them
at water-polo.
The swimming match started
off well for u s , when we had
a 1—2 in the first event, the
100m freestyle. In the next
event, Andy w a s just beaten
in the breastroke, and C o l i n
was third. A reversal of the
100m freestyle placing w a s
made when Dave beat Rory
on the touch, in the 200m
freestyle. T h e official time
keeper T o n i , w a s unable to
separate them on the stop
watch. In the backstroke,
P a u l , an e x i l e from last
year took advantage of
everyone's tiredness at this
stage, and scorched up a n d
down to come first, with Ian
second. The last individual
event was the medley in
which N i c k showed that he
had learned at school, to w i n
convincingly.
In the two relays w e
entered three teams. In the
medley relay we were first,
second and fourth, and we
came first and second in the
freestyle relay a s w e l l . A t
the end when the points were
totaled we had won convincingly
4 3 - 2 9 . We now hope that w e
can keep up this form in
next week's U L U gala, and so
r e t a i n t h e C o l l e g e
Championship.
After the swimming, our
seconds (composed mainly of
first years) beat Holloway 5—2
in the water-polo match. In
the first quarter we started
off badly whena player of some
experience put two goals
past our unsuspecting defense.
After the second quarter the
team got to grips with the
game. Dave in the 'hole', after
a verbal lashing, began to
start pivoting the attacks, and
was well supported by Sam.
In midfield C o l i n and Amir
did a good job in supporting
the forwards, coming back
to defend, when required. Ian
was sound in defence and
George played well despite
h i s bad l e g . J i m performed
s o l i d l y in goal, and showed
a greater sense of purpose
than usual probably because
he had just been elevated to
the post of official starter for
the swimming match. T o n i ' s
experience proved useful in
getting us back into the
match. In the second quarter
we drew level, thanks to a
terrific shot from Sam w h i c h
went into the top corner of
the net and then Amir got the
first .goal of h i s hat-trick. In
the last two quarters, our
fitness bcamee obvious and
with two more goals from
Amir, and an effort from
C o l i n we finished up the 5—2
winners. Then we returned to
the bar.-
F i n a l l y we must mention
that w e have just been declared
winners of the Middlesex
League Second D i v i s i o n
1975 (on goal average), and
winners of the London Winter
knockout 1975. T h e first
team won their recent match
1 3 - 1 against Hounslow i n
the first round of this years,
competition.

to restore confidence from
their dismal performances of
l a t e , IC were thwarted by
poor f i n i s h i n g . However a
scramble ensued i n the
Royal Free goal area early
in the game and Steve Bates
calmly kicked the ball out
of the keepers hands into the
empty net. Pressure w a s
continued in their half and
P h i l Singleton pressed home
the advantage with a fine
cross shot to make it 2—0.-
The second half saw
a complete change in play.
Royal Free applied the thumb-
screws but skillful defensive
play with Dave Brabbin
dominant in the a i r , E a n
Huntington masterful on the
ground and some brave keeping
from K e v A l l e n kept them out.
Y e t a crack w a s somehow
found and IC were up against
it with a narrow 2—1 lead.
Pressure on the IC goal
continued till the Royal
Free keeper made a dash down
the right wing, the ball found
its way to Master Bates who
was thinking of passing t i l l
choruses of ' D o a Pete' from
the back found their way to
his sensitive ears. H e looked
up, measured the distance
(with h i s infamous appendage)
and let loose a blistering 45
yard drive which found the
net before the keeper had
returned to h i s line. 3—1 and
IC revived their superiority
with the new 'steaml ineo"
Terry Lindong bustling
uproductively, and rare
flashes from both Gareth
Roberts and Steve G e e . A
