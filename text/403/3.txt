M U X
NUS Drama
Conference
F O R T Y D E L E G A T E S from a s far afield a s St Andrew's came
together to d i s c u s s the NUS and drama, both a s a recreation and
a s a professional study. Organisation, by R e x Osborne, execut-
ive member responsible for drama, w a s almost non-existent and
it was apparent that the paucity of participants w a s the result of
poor communications, either between the N U S and college
executives or between the executives and their drama groups.
Many people had arrived with no idea of what was to be d i s c u s s e d ,
or what function the conference had within the complex structure
of N U S . In fact it w a s explained that we could only elect and
) panel, which would in turn advise the
ronic that the decisions of previous
contrary to the spirit of the only N U S
'urge' an advisory ('ad,
executive. It seems
conferences have been
policy drama.
For the last two years
the . N U S h a s practised a
boycott of the National
Student Drama F e s t i v a l ,
the annual jamboree organised
and financed by ' T h e Sunday
T i m e s ' , through Mr C l i v e
Wolfe. T h i s boycott arose
from Mr Wolfe's refusal to
accept various demands
made by a previous conference,
the most controversial being
that the conference should
elect students to the board,
appointed by Mr Wolfe, which
selects productions to go to
the festival.
It seems to be fundamental
law of student life that the
NUS and the students it
suoDosedly represents lead
different | j V e s . T h e drama
field i s no exception; grass
roots opinion from drama
groups a l l over the country
is that the N S D F i s a good
thing and much prestige i s
gained by those lucky enough
to be selected. This year
more than 120 groups entered
for the London festival, t h e
method of selection, by
professional theatre people,
also provides critical a s s e s s -
ment for productions, even
if they cannot be selected.
The N U S now appears t o
have seen the error of i t s
boycott, though it i s not
Clear whether this i s because
this year's festival i s already
under way and student
selectors could not be
included at this late stage.
A motion w a s presented by
t h e a d . p a n e l w h i c h
recommended that the N U S
should be involved with the
N S D F and should investigate
the ways in which they could

excellent theatrically, might
not be "theur cup of t e a " .
Mr .Wolfe has. never made
any secret of' the fact that
he wishes to select productions
of the sole criterion of
dramatic effectiveness and
thus make the festival a
showcase of the best in
student drama. T h i s attitude
does not provide the democracy
that the N U S i s s o keen o n .
Mr Wolfe's organisation i s
that of a benevolent dictator;
provide a s s i s t a n c e , particularly
r.n the fields of communications
and publicity. Of course,
there i s no, p o s s i b i l i t y of the
union giving financial a i d and
the festival must continue
with commercial sponsorship.
T h i s year it w a s reported
that ' T h e Sunday Times'
could not c o n t i n u e i t s
sponsorship. B u t , at the
last moment, the newspaper
announced that it would
continue with the a i d of
co-sponsors, who turned out to
be the Scottish T o u r i s t -
Board and the House of
Fraser. T h e . 1976 festival
w i l l be in Edinburgh next
Apri I.
On the matter of elected
selectors little w a s said
since this i s a matter that
it i s too late to
about this year,
reiterated that
that elected students should
be on Mr Wolfe's board. T h e
opinion of those delegates
that I talked to w a s that
drama groups would not
have _such confidence in the
ability of students whose
opinions might be clouded by
a production w h i c h , although

conflict between the N U S
and i t s drama groups i s the
extent of that benevolence.
Other subjects dealt with
were the plight of students
in c o l l e g e s of drama, and
the place of community
theatre i n the student drama
scene. It i s difficult to s e e
how the former fits into the
remit of a conference on
student drama, e s s e n t i a l l y
an amateur field. Although
there are various student
groups experimental and
community theatre, the field
of student drama s t i l l cont i nues
to be dominated by those
interested in conventional
.presentation of p l a y s ;
unfortunately those sorts of
people are not the ones who
want t o ' spend a whole
Saturday in London d i s c u s s i n g
the NUS and drama.
