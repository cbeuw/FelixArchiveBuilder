Bar prices-reply
Sir, — It was with some
concern that I read last
week's i s s u * of F E L I X
containing Mr A h l e r s ' letter
concerning Bar P r i c e s . To
find a fellow member of the
ICU Executive propounding
theories for which there is
no factual b a s i s , is perturbing
to say the least. Mr A h l e r s
never has been, is not at the
moment, and in a l l probability
never w i l l be on the Refectory
C o m m i t t e e or the Bar
Committee during his stay
at College.
To reply to his letter in
two parts, I shall first refer
to his quote " o v e r the past
two years we have seen a
steady erosion in the price
differential between the
College bars and local public
h o u s e s " . In fact quite the
reverse is true for many
beverages, for example,
Guinness, two years ago cost
2p more in the Ennismore
than the College bars, and
at present the differential is
5p.
The next sentence reads
" I n an effort to maximise
profits ... the Bar Committee
opted for the layman's way
o u t " — what pathetic,
libelous drivel Mr A h l e r s .
The facts are Governing
Body told the Refectory-
Committee " t o maximise bar
p r o f i t s " . Refectory committee
then told the Bar Committee
" t o review its pricing
structure in order to achieve
a gross mark-up of 35%.
Where is the opting for the
layman's way out? The Bar
committee did not, in fact,
have any choice in the
matter.
Next he says that "indeed
takings are already d o w n " .
Totally irrelevant comment
this, since this was before
the prices were increased
and is more due to the
financial situation of the
students rather than the
bars finances.
The whole of the next
paragraph is factually
incorrect as Mr A h l e r s should
know, as he works in the
J C R bar in the Sherfield
Building where we charge
all outside bookings using
that bar, at least 1p more
on all drinks consumed.
F i n a l l y , instead of Mr
Ahlers " u r g i n g the Bar
committee I should
like to urge him to keep his
ramblings to himself until
he c h e c k s his facts. A l s o ,
it is not my desire to increase
prices at a l l , and with this
in m i n d , I m a d e t h e
recommendations to Council
(which are printed in F E L I X )
concerning the future running
of the bars to the benefit of
the student body.
I remain Sir, your informed
obedient servant,
N P B R A Y S H A W
RSMU President
Chairman, Bar Committee
H a l l fees
Sir, - Bearing in mind Peter
Teague's comments on IC
hall fees I would like to
a few comparisons with the
cost and s t a n d a r d of
accommodation in inter-
collegiate h a l l s . I refer
s p e c i f i c a l l y to International
Hall w h i c h , out of a total
of 450, has a significant
proportion of IC students.
F i r s t l y the rooms
themselves. These are of
reasonable proportions but
have an inadequate s i z e
window, presumably to save
on heating b i l l s . Heat is
supplied by a radiator
which enthusiastically pumps
out energy and often refuses
to be turned off. The furnishing
is simple if a somewhat
dilapidated and the power
points cunning little two-amp
devices. The most notable
deficiency however, is the
absence of wash b a s i n s .
Cooking f a c i l i t i e s are
non-existent and indeed a l l
but electric kettles are
banned. There are " k i t c h e n -
e t t e s " on every floor, but
even here, cooking is banned
and there is no equipment to
cook on in any case.
Meals are sub-college
refectory standard in quality
but adequate in quantity.
The breakfast is particularly
good and meals are provided
at the weekends. Meals
however, are part of the
standard hall fees and no
refund is available for uneaten
meals.
The final and most
devastating fact however, is
the cost. Intercollegiate h a l l s
unlike college h a l l s get no
subsidy from the university
and therefore have to break
even. T h i s means that the
fees amount to £500 per
s e s s i o n as compared with
£300 paid by IC hall residents.
Intercollegiate h a l l s have
in fact the highest fees in the
country. (Not quite, Westfield
is top of this league—Ed.)
Personally, I think IC hall
residents, e s p e c i a l l y Peter
Teague should keep quiet
and hope nobody notices.
Yours sincerely,
N G R E E N

E D I T O R I A L
There was a great deal of confusion over last week's issue of
F E L I X and quite understanding too! It was meant to be sold for
5p with all the proceeds going to the Rag charities. However,
Mr John Kearns and his helpers failed to/turn-up in sufficient
numbers to help s e l l the paper and so the idea was dropped on
the Friday morning. We have received a few ballon fillers for
the front page photo but we are keeping it open until next Friday
lunchtime. While we are s t i l l on Rag, J K asked to ask the
following people to come to the Union office and pick up their
prizes from the Rag lottery. These are:- A Chodorowski, Dr
Hocking, D Rootron, Dave Dawes, E d Clutton, Wilkinson (Green
213),M Tilbury, D r H a r d w i c k , and Sue James.
It is always regretful when a Union officer is forced, for one
reason or another, to resign from his or her post. It was doubly
sad for us to hear of Keith A h l e r s ' resignation. We hope that he
has better luck in future and take this opportunity to congratulate
him on h i s contribution to both G u i l d s and I C U .
Another case of resignation (sorry—no pun intended) is that
of A s t o n . They have decided to withdraw their membership to
NUS by 893 to 332 votes. There has been steady but d e c l i n i n g
rate of d i s a f f i l i a t i o n s , the peak being reached in 1970, but this is
the time a university has decided to do so. The consequences of
this move, wise or not, are far reaching e s p e c i a l l y when it
comes before the eve of an NUS national conference at which
the NUS constitution is to be debated.
Obviously, the decision disaffiliate is not a light one, however,
it is a decision that can be taken without any background know-
ledge or information and this is dangerous. While the benefits
of being a member of NUS may not be immediately clear, most
people are agreed that the student body as a whole, need to have
a nationally co-ordinated group. We must never lose sight of
this fact.
What most students do not want to see is a group, similar to
the NUS executive, purporting to represent students interest,
being run by a gang of political careerists of any particular
denomination. 3ut we now reach an impasse. Students are not
w i l l i n g , presumably because it does not concern them, to get
up and take part in N U S , let alone their own unions, in order
to achieve any changes.
No where is this more blatant than at Imperial C o l l e g e . L a s t
week we saw a paltry number of IC students at a union meeting
at which motions to N U S conference were to be d i s c u s s e d .
If this is the prevailing attitude then it is quite clear that we
do not need U G M s and furthermore that U G M s should not be the
controlling bdoy of the U n i o n . So what can we have instead?
An S R C (Students Representative Council) system? Or do we
leave a l l decisions to the ICU Executive with possibly ratification
by Council as in its present form?
These questions need answering and they need answering
now. I hope that those of you who read this article w i l l stimulate
d i s c u s s i o n on the issues raised here.
My special thanks to G i l l (heroine of heroines), Ian (super
hero), P h i l (hero) and other members of staff (great bunch) for
their help In producing this week's issue. See you next week?

STOIC at it again !
E A R L I E R THIS M O N T H , S T O I C , IC's very own S t u d e n t
T e l e v i s i o n service recorded an interview with the actor, Dirk
Bograde, which was to have been shown next Tuesday. However,
due to minor problems, the interview is not yet ready for
showing, but S T O I C hope to transmit it sometime before the
end of term.
took place at the training
studio of the Educational
T e l e v i s i o n Centre, 3attersea
where near broadcast standard
f a c i l i t i e s are a v a i l a b l e .
S T O I C is allowed use of
the studio because many
of their programmes, especially
the interviews, are broadcast
over London through Channel
7 of the I L E A closed circuit
television network. Channel
7 is received by colleges,
schools and universities
all over London.
The programme, which
w i l l include c l i p s from "The
Blue Lamp' and "The
Servant' as w e l l as from
' P e r m i s s i o n to K i l l " is
being edited today at the
University of London Audio
V i s u a l - A i d Centre.
Mr Bogarde, well known
for his role as romantic
film hero in the s i x t i e s , was
in the country to promote
his latest film, ' P e r m i s s i o n to
K i l l ' . In the film he plays the
part of an intelligence agent,
who by devious means
endeavours to prevent a
political exile from returning
to his country to start a
revolution.
The interview is being
regarded as something of a
scoop; Mr Bogarde having
only been interviewed the
day before by R u s s e l Harty
and on the same day (as the
S T O I C interview) was inter-
viewed by Tony B i l b o w for
B B C ' 2 s programme, ' F i l m
Night'.
