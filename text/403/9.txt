George Melly/Burlesque (Great Hall)
How can you explain the phenomenon
that is George M e l l y ? I mean, on the
face of it, how the hell can an over-
large, very E n g l i s h m i d d l e - c l a s s , ex-
public school ponce get away with
singing the blues without making a
complete d i l d o of himself? Perhaps
the reason lies in the way he interpretes
the songs so that they fit go well with
his persona; in no way does he try to
authenticate the blues with the twenties
and thirties idiom that spawned them.
T h i s , coupled with what seemingly is
an inborn gift to be a naturally eccentric
performer, is why he has been accepted
by jazz audience's throughout the years
s i n c e his original excursions fronting
the M i c k Mulligan band of the fifties.
After a short instrumental introduction
by the Feetwarmers (John C h i l t o n
trumpet, C o l i n Bates piano, C h u c k
Smith drums and Barry D y l a n bass).
Melly came on stage to rapturous
applause and was straight into h i s
signature tune 'Good Time George', a
song that just about sums up h i s act.
Ian Morse
Much of the repertoire dealt with the
hedonistic pursuits he has encountered
during his not so sheltered life, the sort
of experiences that crop up time and
again in h i s frank and often hilarious
autobiography, 'Owning up'.
Among the many h ighlights of h i s
set were the Ethel Walters' Song, 'Get
up off your knees daddy, you can't win
me back that way' (particularly en-
lightening) and 'My Canary has circles
under its eyes'. During the act he went
to great lengths to widen the interest in
the lyrics w i t h h is humourous introductions
and anecdotes, which entice on to
I isten to the often bri 1
1 iant i nterpretat ions.
Towards the end of h i s performance
the audience, encouraged by a section
of M e l l y ' s seemingly c u l t i s t following,
joined in the chorus of the well known
'Nuts' and the 'Lobster Song'which
contains a rather dry line concerning
the parts of a male anatomy that beer
sometimes reaches.
Although their set was not up to
par with the performance they gave in
the Union Refectory last month, Burlesque
showed that they are far better than
the present station they find themselves
(ie playing the pub/small c l u b circuit.)
To a certain degree the band seem to
be getting away from their previous
inclination toward the m u s i c a l inspiration
of Frank Zappa, although the presence
of the man's work is s t i l l to be heard
e s p e c i a l l y with their variation of Z a p p a ' s
'Be Bop Tango', where Burlesque
invite the audience to participate in
manic versions of the dance. The
band d i s p l a y f i n e m u s i c i a n s h i p
particularly the electric pianist and
lunatic guitarist, who is a true showman.
Among the selections played were
'Gorrilla Crunch!, 'Lana Turner',
'Acupuncture' and the old Safaries
number, 'Wipe Out'. They were suprisingly
well received, and as a result the
Ents Committee w i l l probably book
them again next term. (For a fuller
review of what they are about see

Joe Pass (At Montreaux '75) - (Pablo)
The first time I saw him. Joe P a s s
w a s being inconspicuous in a Beeb—2
E l l a F i t z g e r a l d " i n c o n c e r t " programme
and what struck me was his economical
playing and h i s masterful lack of hair.
T h i s latter aspect of Joe P a s s is not too
evident on the album, yet the smooth,
modest approach to his guitar —
technique has remained the foundation
of h i s sound.
Sensibly enough, he opens with a
track that a l l but the most leaden —
eared w i l l have heard — Stevie Wonder's
" Y o u are the Sunshine of My L i f e " ,
thankfully without the armada of " F u n k y
C l a u i n e t s " that even Des O'Connor
probably uses by now. The introductions
over, he then moves into a number of
h i s own compositions and jazz standards,
w h i c h are played with delicate respect
to what is presumably, by their hushed
s i l e n c e , a knowledgeable jazz audience.
H i s musical a b i l i t y is beyond
question' yet to " l i s t e n " throughout
both s i d e s of this album and remain
interested and appreciative Of the
slight variations as eash new track
appears, is something for the committed
guitar enthusiast and, due to the lack
of any accompaniment, the numbers
soon begin to sound ominously s i m i l a r .
H i s talent might well be better show-
c a s e d within the context of a band w h i c h
could supply the necessary variety, for
after a w h i l e , the 'sameness' of the
playing turns to tedium — the same
tones, the same progressions, the same
limitations. Imagine Keith Emerson
restricted to a c o u s t i c piano, w i t h no
accompaniment, no v o c a l s , no multi-
tracking, and you might get a fair idea
of how Joe Pa§s comes across here.
Hardly the stuff to scrabble your
aural s e n s e s .
Dr Feelgood - Malpractice (UA)
T h i s L P is " r a w " , there's not a
spot of restraint in siqht, as the F e e l -
goods fight and k i c k with their intention-
a l l y - devastating battering-ram of
r'nb rock and r o l l . If you haven't got
the Hifi wound up as far as it w i l l go
before the knobs start falling off and
the speakers start jumping out of their
mountings, then you've missed the
message. Ideal stuff to get the esp-
saturated heavies r o c k i n ' their e y e l i d s
at the next stomp.
With effectiveness based on sheer
power and s i m p l i c i t y — you won't get
confused by the time changes 'cos there
aren't any s i n c e the drummer only
knows one rudimentary beat and he's
s t i c k i n g to it with clenched teeth. Anyway,
if Status Quo can get away with it,
who's to stop the K i n d l y Doctor.
Be—Dop Deluxe — Axe Victim (Harvest)
T h i s is the first album from Bebop
Delux, which has s i n c e been followed
by " F u t u r a m a " , and soon the new one
"Sunburst F i n i s h e d " w i l l be completed.
The band completely revolves around
one member and one instrument, B i l l
Nelson and the lead guitar being those
in question. Combined they can produce
some pretty neat stuff, and although
he seems to have fallen into the Bowie
/Harley/Hunter wasted-land as far as
lyrical and vocal approach is concerned,
the raison d'etre of a l l this becomes
evident when the chords and runs start
to fly from the s i l v e r strings.
With his a b i l i t y there is no need at
all for the mascara masquerack and the
camp pretty-boy vocals — so unnecessary.
If your penchant is racy, inventive lead
guitar. B i l l N e l s o n merits a listen and
if he got a better band behind him and
dropped the poseur rubbish, a truly top-
flight artist could emerge.
" N o trains to h e a v e n " exemplifies
what this band's about - virtuoso
fretboard work surrrounding an adequate
song which becomes transformed into a
thoroughly listenable, punchy 3 minutes,
if he can keep the happy campers at
bay with time h e ' l l cut the imitators
like Trower to shreds.
Chris Farlowe - "We can work it out"
(Poldyor)
Never did like C h r i s F a r l o w e . Thought
he buggered up C o l l o s s e u m and detracted
from the little that Atomic Rooster
had to offer. Now he mangles a Lennon
—Macartney composition by knocking
out this soul — c l i c h e d morass of conga-
players galore, cutie cutLe background
v o c a l s , subhuman grunts et al - No way,
Danno. H i s .appearance on T O T P a
while back adequately confirmed a l l the
aforementioned assumptions. Sorry, but
the nicest thing I can say is that the
B-side would be listenable if it weren't
for the singer.

The Law, Language and
Lenny Bruce (Phil Spector)
With the release of the long
awaited Lenny Bruce film starring
Dust i n Hoffman, the record market has
not s u p r i s i n g l y been flooded with material
by the late master of saterical wit. So
far w e ' v e had at least five albums
recorded at various stages of the mans
short and tragic career.
T h i s particular album was recorded
for prosperity by P h i l Spector at an
unstated night c l u b , and is taken from
the period in h i s life when Bruce was
s t i l l wound up In h i s multiple battles
with h i s legal persecutors. Although
using h i s personal situation to great
advantage wlthhls brilliant parodies of
j u d i c i a l system, his obsession with h i s
trials tend to o c c a s i o n a l l y border on
boredom. Other s e l e c t i o n s Included on the
album deal with familiar Bruce references
to American sexual h a b i t s , religion and
race. A s so often happens when a revival
of interest in a particular artist Is In full
s w i n g one must sort out de sheet from de
sugar as it were. F o r me, this album
o c c a s i o n a l l y falls short of.the Tate and
L y l e bag. Anyone interested in finding
why Bruce was such a master of irreverence
could do no better than to listen to h i s
epic Carnegie H a l l concert, a v a i l a b l e on
United A r t i s t s . . ,.
