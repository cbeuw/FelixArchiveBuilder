The 19th London Film Festival
"Welfare"
(USA 1975. D i r . Frederick Wiseman)
Formerly a professor of law at Boston,
wiseman began making documentaries on
American institutions and organisations
during the mid-60's including, to date,
a high s c h o o l , a h o s p i t a l , an army base,
a police station and a private research
centre. Rarely seen in this country but
widely shown on T V and round the
c o l l e g e c i r c u i t s in the USA he created a
new concept in documentary film making
- no commentary,talk over or leading
questions from an interviewer — just a
photographic record of what he terms
'normalcy'. Completely oblivious to the
camera, 'normalcy' often turns out to be
far more bizarre than anything e l s e .
After his last film "Prinate" (which
unfortunately had the intrinsic b i a s of
being man against monkey), "Welfare"
takes a long look at the intricacies of
the American welfare system.
Although vastly more complex than
the British system (Catch —22 regulations
in hieroglyphics!) this is perhaps the
most relevant to us of Wiseman's films,
particularly in view of our rising
unemployment. C l i e n t s at the Waverely
Centre in New York include the jobless,
homeless, elderly and hungry from a
wide c r o s s - s e c t i o n . of the c i t y ' s poor,
both black and white — a fact that
surprises many Americans apparently
under the impression that the welfare
system is a black institution. Any
c / n i c i s m s one might have that the
c l i e n t s are 'trying it on' are soon
d i s p e l l e d as Wiseman follows several
c a s e histories coming back to them;
again and again for long periods of time
(the film is over 2V* hours long!), day
after day as the c l i e n t s are shuttled
from one room to another c l u t c h i n g a
fistful of forms, e n d l e s s l y repeating
themselves in a futile attempt to make
themselves understood. But the c a s e -
workers, sometimes cutting- through the
red-tape in their quest for the facts,
are not the orges that they appear to
be to the c l i e n t s ; as facts get m i s l a i d ,
forms lost and c l i e n t s more 'paranoid'
we finally see tempers fray and realise
that caseworkers and c l i e n t s are victims
of a monstrous and inhuman system.

"Winstanley"
(Great Britain, 1975. Dir. Kevin Brownlow,
Andre Mollo)
The opening film of the festival
" W i n s t a n l e y " tells the surprising story
of what was probably the world's first
commune based on a c o m m u n i s t
philosophy, set up in 1649 on George's
H i l l , Surrey - ironically a sight now
occupied by the stockbroker belt.
Taken from the novel 'Comrade Jacob'
by D a v i d Cante and the writings of
Gerrard • Winstanley, a Cromwellian
soldier and founder of the commune,
the film brings out many of the problems
impl icit" in a communist philosophy, not
least applied problems such as self-
sufficiency, s t i l l relevant today over
300 years later. F o l l o w i n g a great
revolution as it did the settlement
did not face instant annihilation as it
might have done a few years earlier
(or today) but w^s given a chance by
the powers on high (then Lord General
Fairfax) only to be wounded and destroyed
by the local Lord of the Manor/pastor
and his ' m i d d l e - c l a s s ' cronies.
The opening battle scene — in the
director's words like " a 17th century
movietone n e w s ! " , effectively cut to
the Prokofier music for E i s e n s t e i n ' s
battle on the ice Alexandar Nevsky -
uses real armour (since replicas would
be too expensive!) and sets a standard
of fastidious, if somewhat unnoticed
at time, attention to detail necessitating
dismantling an a n c i e n t dam and
transporting it from E s s e x to Surrey;
manufacture of 150 fifteen foot pikes
and peasants' boots copied from one
of the few pairs s t i l l e x i s t i n g ; c h i c k e n s
from Rare Breeding B i r d s Society;
interiors shot in 17th century Chastleton
House containing original furniture and
tapestries and court scenes from the
oldest active court house in the country
at Malmesbury, Wiltshire. Even the
sound track had to be re-recorded for
the exterior shots (due to the proximity
of the Heathrow flight path) and an
Ornithologist detailed to pick out any
unoriginal birds. A pity then, that
after, a l l t h i s , the starving peasants
look less than convincing.
"Fear of Fear"
(West Germany, 1975. Dir Ralner Weiner.
Fassbinder)
F o l l o w i n g F a s s b i n d e r ' s s u c c e s s
with "Fear Eats the Soul" which was
recently shown on T V , the festival is
showing a l l three of h i s 1975 productions.
"Fox" (a cruel tale of homosexuality)
w i l l soon be released at the Gate
cinema w h i l s t the fate of the other
two, "Fear of Fear" and "Mother
Kiister's Trip to Heaven", i s , l i k e
many (50) of the festival films, uncertain.
" F e a r of F e a r " deals with a young
w i f e ' s depression, brought on by a limp
marriage to a rather Insensitive husband
("too busy d e a r " ) , which feeds on
itself like one of R D L a i n g ' s rather
nastier 'knot' until she sees herself in
the mirror as a stranger. Is it the fear
of madness? It doesn't matter, i t ' s a
self-alienation s h e ' s afraid of and it
puts her in serious threat of a nervous
breakdown; her attempted escapes
seem only to drag her further down as
she tries in turn v a l l i u m , the Chemist
who d i s p e n s e s it, daylight drinking,
o b s e s s i o n a l swimming and finally a half-
hearted attempt at wrist cutting (hubby
finally rouses himself).
P e r s o n a l l y I hungered for greater
insight into her mind — the abstract
being one of the cinemas greatest
potentials (cf P o l a n s k i ' s " R e p u l s i o n " ;
A l t m a n ' s " I m a g e s " ) ; instead we are
treated to a few phoney 'distorted-bit-of-
glass-in-front-of-the-lens' techniques every
time she looks in the mirror and one
brief, but memorable (as it enabled us
as an E n g l i s h audience to whip off
the ghastly earphone commentary
headgear!) episode where her thoughts
are echoed in a neatly edited Leonard
Cohan L P
Taken as it stands " F e a r of F e a r "
provides some superbly acted, if
somewhat s u p e r f i c i a l , reasoning to
explain why more than twice as many
women as men suffer from mental
