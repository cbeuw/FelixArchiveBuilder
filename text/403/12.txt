Imperial College 11
Lee 'B' 8
A F T E R F I V E W E E K S of
hunting around for a team, on
Saturday November 22nd,
Imperial C o l l e g e finally
managed to muster nine
people together to journey
to darkest Orpington. We
were s t i l l one short, as one
of the brave few didn't show
up, having had a bit too much
drink the night before.
Anyway, having decided
that this flaker wasn't going
to come, the team set off to
V i c t o r i a with much trepidation
and a distinct feeling of
impending disaster. T h i s
feeling was well justified
(although later proved wrong)
as four of our number were
lacking in experience, and
the rest hadn't played for five
weeks. A l s o Lee (who play
at Orpington) have a very
strong c l u b . -Their first
team has won the South of
England L a c r o s s e League
for the last ten years. And
so we arrived.
Lee gallantly lent us one
of their younger players, and
on starting immediately
scored three goals in as
many minutes. Surprisingly
IC did not lose heart, but
in fact improved dramatically.
The defense started working
together, and although often
a man down, did a good job
of breaking up L e e ' s attacks.
The midfield and attack,
whilst not being skilful
enough to keep possession,
did, o n being fed the ball
from defense, often make
dangerous runs at goal. T h i s
helped boost morale
considerably, e s p e c i a l l y
after conceeding the first
three goals, when Derek
Senner ran up and scored,
and quite effectively stopped
the rot. At half time the
score was 5—4 in Imperial's
favour.
On starting the second
half Lee piled on the pressure,
and got one goal back. However,
again the defense closed up
and cut out the Lee attack.
For the next quarter of an
hour a tooth and nail battle
ensued, in which both
s i d e s tried to gain an
advantage, neither side
ever leading by more than
one goal. But suddenly, in
the last quarter, it a l l
c l i c k e d again and IC q u i c k l y
scored two goals while Lee
tried but failed against a
stalwart defense. T h i s
psychological a d v a n t a g e
remained until the end of the
match, leaving IC the victors
by 11—8.
A s p e c i a l mention should
go to B i l l J a c k s o n in defense,
who is improving week by
week, and to Derek Senner,
who has never played before,
but showed as much s k i l l
as many who have played
for years. With a bit more
practice and match experience
Re w i l l prove an invaluable
asset. I would a l s o like to
thank the whole team for
producing such a good
d i s p l a y , working so hard, and
proving that the impossible)
can be done. F i n a l l y thanks
to Lee, for being such good
hosts, and giving us such an
enjoyable m a t c h v

Imperial College 1st XI
Mill Hill HC
A F T E R A R A T H E R prolonged
bus ride — taking over V/* hrs
the team arrived travel weary
but nevertheless eager to
play hockey, at Mill H i l l . On
coming out onto the pitch we
realised that we would be at
a disadvantage not being
used to playing on such an
undulating and sloping pitch.
The game started on time and
the teams appeared to be fairly
evenly matched, both s i d e s
making promising attacking
moves. The first goal came to
Mill H i l l when slightly s l a c k
marking in the middle of the
' D ' a l l o w e d a Mill H i l l player
to receive a pass from the right
wing and slot the ball home
for a goal. IC were, however,
unperturbed and fought back
and got a series of short
corners awarded. The goal
was scored from one of these —
Mike Isles's shot was blocked
by the goalie, A l l e n Brown
picked up the rebound and
after a nifty piece of stickwork
put in a cracking shot from
about 10 yards. Not long
after though Mill H i l l replied
with a second goal from a short
corner which beat the players
on the line by virtue of a
deflection from someone's
stick on the way towards goal.
The score remained at 2—1
• at i half-time.
In the second h a l f , play
continued more or less as
before and IC were unlucky not
to score from either open
play or from several corners
which were awarded during
the half. Mill H i l l did not
miss c h a n c e s , however, and
scored two goals in the second
half — both from corners.
The final score was a win to
Mill H i l l 4 goals to l.although
the result did not truly reflect
the relative a b i l i t i e s of the
two teams.
Team: Charlie Brown, Jim
Marshall (capt), Kim Houlden,

Imperial College II Mixed 5
Chelsea 1st Mixed 4
AS T H E S C O R E suggests,
it was close and almost
" e I e c t r i f i n g " m a t c h ,
particularly towards the end.
After a disappinting start,
C h e l s e a had one person
ready to play at the starting
time of 2.00pm, the remainder
arriving at about 3.30pm
claiming ignorance of the
match. So after an exceptional
start by a l l we were soon
leading 4—1 needing only one
match for victory. Then
C h e l s e a played their joker
(having only pumps and no
racket — an apt description)
their 3rd pair proceeded to
thrash the whole team, the
maximum score we obtained
w a s 6. T h i s brought the
score to 4—4, then Ian and
C l a i r played their worse
pair and c l i n c h e d the match
with comparitive ease and an
almost nonchalant attitude.
The girls deserve a s p e c i a l
mention for their fortitude
even when the opposition
continually hits the shuttle
at them, striking them on the
face or upper trunk, they
were not daunted and are
improving in every match they
play. A feeling of " e s p r i t de
c o r p s " is developing which
should help in times to come.
Team: Wendy Low, Kin Lim,
Clair Busby, Ian Mayne, Andy

London Hospital 1
T O R N S C R E A M I N G from their
warm tracksuits (and hats) IC
1st XI faced London Hospital
at Walthamstow on Wednesday.
Throwing aside the
dreadful memories of the
previous match IC soon
raised their game to a
remarkable level of mediocrity
and forced a couple of corners.
From one of these Mike
Isles lashed a great shot
against the upright. Encouraged
beyond belief at this the IC
defence promptly let 'Our
C h a r l i e ' have a kick at the
b a l l . R i s i n g to the bait he
dutifully performed his
'Wechishy' M i s s (safely) and
everyone relaxed, including
the L H forwards who weren't
seen around for some time
afterwards.
IC forwards meanwhile,
aided by some good hockey
from A Brown, forged deep
into foreign territory and
a l l o w e d . themselves the
luxury of a few more missed
corners.
In the second half IC
defended the goal patrolled
by the opposition umpire whose
o c c a s s i o n a l a b e r r a t i o n s
regarding obstruction and
dangerous play reduced Ivan
Hodgson near to a mental
breakdown — John Andrews
t o o , but it didn't show so
much! IC pressed strongly for
a goal and even found time for
some fancy short passing in
the left flank area; after being
curtly instructed to cut out
this pansy sort of behaviour,
the left back hacked the L H
inside forward near to death —
honour s a t i s f i e d .
Sid Golding on the right
wing split the opposition
defense twice with beautiful
crosses but nothing resulted
apart from a lucky clearance
off the l i n e .
With three minutes to go
L H forced a corner - obstruction
the man said — and shot a
good goal. T h i s left IC
nothing to do but scrounge
for a team shampoo and
mutter about the life expectancy
of opposition umpires.

F o o t b a l l
late run from Steve Gee
resulted in a . Royal Free
defender adding h i s name to
the scoresheet with an
excellent own goal. Royal
Free were worth more than a
4 - 1 defeat but that can be
attributed to another powerful
display from IC.
