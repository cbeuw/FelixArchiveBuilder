SPECIAL F E A T U R E
Articles by Hie, Ian and Paul
T H E P H E N O M E N O N of " A f r o - r o c k " , as
it is known today, first appeared on ,the
B r i t i s h music scene around 1969/70
when a large amount of interest was
generated by a sudden wave of A f r i c a n
and West Indian bands who appeared
from nowhere and presented their
audiences with a new, energetic
sound to get stuck into. The -vibes
went out and the ripples spread as these
infectious rhythms and time — signatures,
that have for centuries formed the
musioal heritage of the A f r i c a n continent,
took hold and began to make their
importance felt on the college' and
club c i r c u i t s . T h i s innate a b i l i t y of
latching onto a beat and improvising, at
any speed, within its confines seems
to flow through the veins of black
musicians. Many bands ( A s s a g a i ,
J a b u l a , Noir) d e r i v e d their 'sound'
from the basic Afro-rhythms, but a l w a y s
present was one central outfit, head and
shoulder above the rest, providing the
direction and stimulus that the others
followed. The band was O s i b i s a .
When they started out, the members
were unknown outside of West A f r i c a ,
but from the beginning they paved the
way, remained the innovators and
added subtle Western influences to their
instinctive a b i l i t i e s . Throughout
their career they have remained faithful
to the original 'sound' while the rest
have disbanded or been sucked into
other less-demanding areas of m u s i c .
Teddy Osei (tenor 6ax, flute, percussion
and father to the band's family) came
over to Britain in 1969 with his brother
Mac Tontoh (trumpet, Fluegelhorn,
percussion), Sol Amarfio - " t h e Rhythm
m a n " - (drums), and a friend Loughty
L a s i s i Amao (Tenor sam, baritone s a x ,
cong as) because of the restrictive
music scene in G h a n a . . Onto this
foundation they recruited Robert B a i l e y
(keyboards), Wendell Richardson (a
fine guitarist), and, spurtauis R, on bass,
completed the lineup for " t h e beautiful
s e v e n " .
Their music at first c o n s i s t e d of
roots - inspired percussive jamboress,
with Amartio the powerhouse timekeeper
behind the beat, and the w e l l co-ordinated
brass trio playing the main melody
in unison. Any gaps were soon filled
with layers of guitar and organ, whilst
Spartacus R, as Amarfio's right-hand
man, pumped the beat along at one
moment, and the next relaxed into a
softer mood where flute or the shimmering
percussive instruments had their solos
highlighted. At that time comparable
competition was negligible and the
first s i n g l e "Music For Gong Gong"
quickly found itself in the charts. In
1971 they signed a five-year contract
with M C A find soon afterwards, the
first album "Osibisa", aided and
abetted by.some imaginative cover-work
from Roger Dean, was well-received
and established both supremacy in the
African rhythm f i e l d , and the m u s i c ' s
popularity. T h i s L P had its fair share
of gems but their real test, as u s u a l ,
came with the release of the follow-up
"Woyaya" in the same year. It turned
out to be a tour-de-force and probably
remains their most impressive effort,
with the delicate moods of "Beautiful
seven", the expertly jazz-finged
"Y-sharp", and Rahsaan Roland K i r k ' s
"Spirits up above", the outstanding
tracks. Here the simple raw energy
and immediatiacy of -the first album had
been broadened in scope and variety by
the blossoming of Richardson and the
increased confidence of B a i l e y to
improvise, a l l i e d to superior songwriting.
Their progression continued into the
3rd album "Heads", but, by this time,
the initial impact of the rhythms w a s
beginning to die down, and with the
bands popularity s l o w l y fading, internal
disagreements showed themselves for
the first time. T h e s e three albums
remain their best to date.
The next year or s o was a time of
change in which Spartacus R left,
followed by Richardson, (now back with
them) and then Amao (at present with
zzebra). In '73 the band knocked out a
rather uninspired soundtrack L P for
"Superfly TNT" with new members

(percussion) and Gordon Hunte (guitar),

which sounded as if it had been completed
to honour a contract and no.more. The
film wasn't much cop either.
The revitalisation of O s i b i s a came
with a move to Warners bros. in that
year, which resulted in the enjoyable
" H a p p y C h i l d r e n " album and the rather
average "Osibirock" in '74, the latter
tending a bit too c l o s e towards the
'pop' side of the market to be rewarding.
Nevertheless, it was followed by the
excellent compilation, "The best of
Osibisa" which could be quite an ear-
opener if your c o l l e c t i o n at home is
devoid of their material. With the
exception of the new one "Welcome
Home" which should be released on
Nov 28th, that brings the band record-
wise up to the present.
Their main problem, as with so
many bands, has always been to re-create
on record what they achieve live on
stage. There they possess a care-free
joie-de-vivre that makes some of the
'' money-and-bus I ness-i s-al I'' mental i ty
of European bands seem trivial by
comparison and when O s i b i s a take to
the boards, they rant, they rave, but,
above a l l , they enjoy themselves — not
by endlessly exhorting the audience to
" P a a a - r - t - e e e " as is currently the
obsession with the hordes of American
sub-disco fodder that four these i s l e s ,

but by performing their own brand of
spontaneous combustion. If you don't
enjoy yourself when they're playing, it's
your loss, but unless your metabolism
tends towards the ice-block, good body-
music w i l l always have its effect, and
half-way through a set this mob can
turn on some storning stuff. They were
on at the Roundhouse last year with
.Gouzaliz and kokonio (two ace bands
well worth checking out) and although
they didn't appear to be firing on a l l
cylinders, the audience were going
bananas all over the place.
That's what they're capable of, so if
you're not busy this Saturday (29th),
make use of your IC privileges and
fork out the 120p necessary. You shouldn't
regret it.
O s i b i s a have come a long way since
their inception with the hypnotic chants
sung out over a constant background
of chattering percussion. Constantly
working on the road, they've had their
ups and downs but a number of things
remain unchanged. The three originals
O s e i , Tontoh and Amarfio are s t i l l
there, looking after business and so
are the batteries of hand-drums and talk-
ing-drums, congas and timbales that
form the essence of their m u s i c . Hopefully
the new album w i l l capture that essence
once more.
So, from the group that refreshes the
parts other bands cannot reach — "criss-
cross riddoms dat explode widhoppiness".
Enjoy them!
Judging from last Sunday's concet
at the De L a Warr in B e x h i l l the group
seem to be stronger than ever m u s i c a l l y ,
particularly with the recent return of
guitarist Wendell Richardson, who
together with their exciting keyboards
player, add a new dimension to O s i b i s a .
Starting with the familiar ' D a w n ' ,
they proceeded to play material from
their new album, 'Welcome Home', which
sounds as if it could be their best
since their initial outing ' O s i b i s a ' .
The new single 'Sunshine Day', is
more commercial than their other chart
attempts (and has more musical depth),
the song leaning more towards a L a t i n -
American inspiration rather than their
African roots. T h i s was followed by
another new tune, 'Seaside Meditation',
which displayed the more instrumental
side of their music reminicent of 'Why'
from their last album, ' O s i b i r o c k ' .
After an exciting 'percussive workout'
showing a l l the subtleties and complexities
of their rythms, they played numbers
from their previous albums. T h e s e
included ' F i r e ' , ' O s i b i s a ' and of
course their piece de resistance,
' M u s i c for Gong Gong' In w h i c h Richardson
showed what fine work he is capable
of. Throughout they displayed great
humour which has always been a
characteristic of their set.
A s mentioned before, they are
appearing here In the Great H a l l
tomorrow and we have been promised
a very special concert so see you there!
