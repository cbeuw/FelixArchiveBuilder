Aston pulls out of NUS
Guilds Exec adopt
Hoyle as presidential
candidate
AT THEIR UGfl last Tuesday, The University of Aston
Students' Union decided by a majority of nearly three to
one to disaffiliate from N'JS, the national student union.
The meeting was attended by 1400 students with a total
of over 1200 actually voting on the motion before the
meeting, which wanted the Union to remain affiliated to
NUS.
Mr Ian Minnis, President
of the Students Union, said
that this vote w a s a " k i c k -
i n - p a n t s " for N U S and he
expected to see some moderate
unions such as Newcastle
and Liverpool to debate
the question of d i s a f f i l i a t i o n .
He would a l s o like to see
militant unions debating the
i s s u e , e s p e c i a l l y places like
Kent and E s s e x . " I t would
be even better if they
d i s a f f i l i a t e d " , he s a i d .
The reason behind A s t o n ' s
decision to quit N U S w a s
that many students there
felt that N U S w a s unrepre-
sentative.
Of the 332 who voted to
stay in (893 voted to leave),
most of them d i d s o because
they thought it would be
more useful to carry on the
fight from within the existing
structure of N U S . Mr Minnis
however, disagrees on this.
Although there h a s been
t h e N U S
d i s c u s s e d ,
c a l l i n g for
to the N U S
no immediate move to
disaffiliate from other unions,
the real turning point w i l l be
at Scarborough when the
m o t i o n s o n
constitution are
If the motion
direct elections
executive is defeated then
there is a real possibility
of a snowballing effect
setting i n .
Peter Teague, I C U
President, would like to see
the question debated at I C ,
but is worried that a decision
might be reached which w a s
based on insufficient
knowledge of what the N U S
is and does. H e does not
feel that A s t o n ' s action w a s
a b i g enough jolt to the
NUS but agreed that should
the motions on the N U S
constitution be defeated,
there would be at least
two or three more d i s -
affiliations.
T H E U N E X P E C T E D resign-
ation of Keith Ahlers a s

Hoyle h a s had to resign as

S R C undecided over rents
T H E S T U D E N T R E S I D E N C E
committee met on Wednesday
to review the rents for next
term. They were unable to
decide on the amount of
increase to be levied although
a completely new system of
distributing rents h a s been
formulated.
It w a s agreed that the
h a l l s should bear the brunt
of any increases because
h a l l s h a d made a l o s s of
over £60.000 whilst the
bouses made a profit of

£2.200. T h e increases

houses and Garden; £6 for
single rooms in houses,
Garden H a l l and O l d B e i t ;
and £7 for Weeks H a l l ,

These increases which
average out at about £1.50
per week more are embodied
in two proposals being put
to the Rector for h i s con-
sideration. H e w i l l then
make a recommendation to
the Governing B o d y .
The results of these
actions w i l l not be available
until the beginning o f next

the Christmas vacations.
