waves adieu to
his doctorate in
circa one
thousand words
With a recommended gestation
period of three years, giving birth
to a PhD thesis can take anything
from between two and ten years.
Few are ever premature and forty
per cent of PhDs started are
terminated at between six to thirty-
six months of age. There is no such
thing as a normal birth, many
requiring caesarean sections. Why
such a high mortality rate? It
appears that most mistakes are
made at the moment of conception,
by couples consumed by false
passion.
Too many students blunder into
a PhD project without even
considering what it's all about. The
whole lifestyle of research is far
removed from any structured
undergraduate existence or graduate
trainee scheme. No first degree can
prepare you for the confusion and
indecision of that first year. Unlike
the PhDs of other European
countries there are no lectures, and
no course plans. You have nothing
more specific than a vague essay
title and a deadline over one
thousand days away. It is entirely
DIY and the 'freedom' is
overwhelming. The expanse of
trackless sand and that mystical
destination is, to say the least,
daunting. Without direction or
guidance this distant goal is too far
out of sight for most students to
comprehend. Many go round in
circles for months or years before
dying of exhaustion 'Doctorless'.
How many eight year olds do you
know who could navigate their way
across the Gobi without a map or
compass? The trouble is there is no
map of the PhD. This mystical
invertebrate beast is without
definition. A physics PhD thesis can
be as slim as twenty pages. Earth
science theses sometimes run to
three volumes. 'You're a bright
lad.. .do something clever for three
years and write a story about it' is
perhaps the most accurate definition
I've yet heard.
But beware, blissful as this might
sound, your final bouncing thesis
must, (in the eyes of the examiners)
contribute something new and
original to the scientific community.
No mean feat for someone without
a map. Not only have you got to
reach that distant town, but you
can't follow a previous route.
Which direction do you set off in,
and how long do you walk for
before changing tact? However
independent a student feels at the
start, there comes a time when
one's research methods need
verifying for a reassurance that you
are heading in the right direction.
In those first six months it is too
tempting to stick your head in the
sand and wait for your supervisor
to pull it out and hand over a
compass.
Unfortunately for many students,
the desert you're trying to cross is
infinite, and the destination
non-existant.
Too many PhD projects are
simply ill conceived; based on one
poorly researched page of vague
text lacking logistical substance.
Numerous proposals are dreamt up
at parties or in the pub. Sweeping
generalisations and massively
grandiose ideas conceal
impracticalities and unsolvable
problems. Surely a project which is
to keep the attention of an individual
for three years deserves more
thought.
But these alcohol-hazed, crack
pot projects need converting into
real science; a task which is all too
often impossible. For example how
is Helen going to investigate
subsurface faulting in South African
Mines, when local law bars women
from stepping underground? Few
proposals pause to even check that
appropriate computer facilities are
available in departments to support
such projects.
Love can make you blind, and
only too often students tempted by
superficially glossy projects, refuse
to see the pitfalls which lie in the
road ahead. So you are going to
interpret radar maps of Io but the
satellite isn't quite in orbit yet.
'Don't worry it will be sending back
data by the end of your first year—
which is always spent just reading
anyway.' But remember if it
develops a fault twelve months later
you will be left up a certain watery
channel without a certain wooden
instrument. Make sure you are
guaranteed some data to work on.
'The geochemistry of Antarctic
carbonaceous chondrites' might
mean a couple of freebee trips to the
snowy continent; even the
advertising blurb seems to
guarantee this. Although you're not
particularly turned on by the
thought of dissolving extra-
terrestrial rocks for three years,
you'd do anything for a trip to
Antarctica. Anyway, anything is
preferable to the empty job market,
isn't it? But when you turn up for
the interview and enquire about
fieldwork, the desperate supervisor
admits that 'the meteorites will
actually be from a dusty museum
collection, and the project is really
lab based with little chance of any
travel'. Not really where a budding
Sir Vivian Fuches wants to spend
the next three years. It's a good job
you asked before you signed away
your life to be tethered to a test tube
for the next ten thousand hours.
Question your real motives for
stepping into a research degree.
What might have vaguely interested
you about the sleeping patterns of
left handed New Guinnean Tree
Shrews, was really the lack of
alternatives; with a complete
absence of employment for
graduate zoologists. Remember you
must eat sleep and breath tree
shrews for 1095 days. One is better
off unemployed with time to think,
than blindly blundering into a
Pregnancy of a PhD
