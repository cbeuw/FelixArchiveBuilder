co-ordinating all the activities which
fall under Estates, i.e. New
Buildings. Development planning.
Maintenance, Conferences,
Security, Athletics, Telephones,
Residences.
My main area of activity is the
introduction of new computerised
management systems to give
effective management information
and control, plus the introduction of
a C A D system for all plans of
college property. These are
basically the foundations on which
to build a modern estates system.
I have been at this college for 18
months in my present post, and
have spent my earlier career in the
university sector.
Mr P.E. Mee
Registrar and Clerk to the
Governors
My current job title is Registrar and
Clerk to the Governors. I am

following: student admissions to the
College, both undergraduate and
postgraduate: undergraduate and
postgraduate scholarships,
including studentships; student

external review of undergraduate

servicing the Board of Studies and
innumerable academic committees,
and dealing with student academic
appeal procedures and disciplinary
procedures.
All of this, of course, is not done
by me but by the dedicated Registry
staff—and it really only indicates
the tip of the iceberg; my job is to
keep an eye on all of it.
Additionally, for the last couple
of years I have been Clerk to the
Governing Body, responsible for
organising and servicing the
Governing Body and its committees
and dealing with constitutional
issues.
I read Economics at U C L , did
National Service in the Army for a

Court Eepartment and then came to
Imperial College in January 1959 to
join the Planning Office concerned
with the expansion and rebuilding
of the College in the 1960s. I
became Registrar in 1967.
You asked for my view of my
main acheivements: only being
mentioned in the pages of Felix half
a dozen times in all these years
perhaps? Surviving this long'.' Main
objectives for the future? To
continue to survive! More
seriously, having been Chairman of
the Harlington Athletic Ground
Committee for many years, and
President of the Football Club since
the early 1970s (although they have
probably forgotten this), I would
dearly love to see an enhancement
of the College's sporting prowess
and facilities. But I have not got
much longer!

ago. 1 was General Manager for
Philips Consumer Lighting. My

Mr T M Neville

No reply.
Dr Jill Pellew
Director of Development
I am working with a team which has
two related areas of responsibility:
providing services to the alumni of
Imperial College: and raising funds
sufficient to enable the College to
develop major projects otherwise
beyond its means. All students will
become alumni and. hopefully, will
wish to stay in touch with the
College. Many of our projects—for
example, substantially improving
student accommodation, 'de-
grotting' the campus and
establishing a student hardship
fund will be directly beneficial to
IC students.
My own working experience is
administrative and academic (1 am
a historian), I worked in
institutional fund-raising in the
United States and the UK for seven
year* before taking up m>
appointment here in January 1991.
Mr K Reynolds
Chief Security Officer
I have been at the College since
August 1991. coming from a
similar position in the media
industry. Prior to entering the
security world 1 served in the Kent
Fire Brigade, South Australian Fire
Brigade. Australian Customs
Department and the Australian
Federal Police Force.
Security is a subject that effects
everyone at the College and it is my
function to ensure that the best
service possible is offered to staff
and students alike.
The security department is
changing and we will obviously go
through a teething period but I can
assure all concerned that the
ultimate goal is an upgraded service
that reflects the prestige enjoyed by
Imperial College.
The main security office is
situated on the ground floor of the
Shcrfietd Building and the door is
always open.

Ms V Straw
Facilities Manager
I have been at the College since
December 1990. coming from a
similar job in the communications
industry. Facilities is a section
within the Estates Division, part of
Imperial College Administration.
My background is more arts than
science, and I obtained my BA from
Manchester University longer ago
than 1 am prepared to admit.
Facilities' means different things in
different organisations, but here at
Imperial it means I am responsible
for .security, car parking,
telephones. some cleaning
functions, grounds and Sports. All
of these areas are very relevant to
students, and together with
everyone involved wc are trying to
improve and upgrade the services
we offer to students and staff. This
will mean change, which is never
easy to implement but we hope that
by the end of this year the benefits
will be more apparent than the
problems! My greatest achievement
so f.u was being awarded my social
colours from ICU last year—what
happened to the tie by the way!
