Cuts Sabbatical Elections
The Government has been accused
of trying to use charity research
funds to offset university funding
cuts. This follows the
announcement of plans for a 40%
increase in university laboratory
charges. The move has been
condemned by research institutions,
and medical charities are
threatening a mass pull out of
research at British universities.
Over 400 scientific posts are
under immediate threat following
warnings from the Cancer Research
Campaign (CRC) that it intends to
cancel its £25 million investment in
cancer treatment. The C R C
scientific director, Professor
Gordon McVie, said 'we are not
going to pay more to do the same
research. We will spend our money
elsewhere in our institutes'.
The overall figure that could be
affected is £300 million annually.
Most of this money comes from
medical research charities such as
the Imperial Cancer Research Fund,
the Cancer Research Campaign, the
Wellcome Trust and others. In the
past these bodies have paid for
research project costs while
universities have provided support
facilities such as technicians,
libraries and administration. The
new Government funding plans
require universities to cost and
charge for the real price of research
in their laboratories. This could lead
to a price rise of 40%.
The consequence of this is likely
to be a cut of 40% in the value of
research projects. David Bowles,
the vice provost of University
College London said that in 1990,
University College accepted £9
million in donations, but will now
have to charge an additional £3
million. Liverpool University
researchers have warned that 'if the
research charities refuse to pay, we
will be in dire straits'.(iCNN)
Use your vote carefully. Look what happened last time.
Fifteen candidates have declared
that they are standing for an IC
Union sabbatical post. The
campaign begins tonight, when
sabbatical papers come down at
5.30pm. Eleven of the candidates
are fully seconded and the other
four are expected to have
difficulties in ensuring they are fully
seconded.
With little known about the
candidates the campaign is in
danger of becoming completely
anonymous, but hustings are
expected to breathe life into this
worthless corpse.
The presidential candidates are:
Anthony Baldwin, proposed by
Bruce Hall, and fully seconded;
Chris Davidson, proposed by Mark
Jackson, also fully seconded; New
Election, proposed by Steve
Farrant, and in no need of
seconders; Angelo Gardini,
proposed by Richard Murray, with
18 seconders; and Rick Bilby,
proposed by James Briadt, with 12
seconders.
The last time that five candidates
ran for president was 1985/6 and it
is believed that one additional
candidate will be standing for
president by the time papers come
down. The deputy presidental race
is a straight contest between Phil
Sharp and New Election. Both
candidates are fully proposed and
seconded. An earlier candidate,
Charles Tomkins, withdrew from
the contest over the weekend.
The Honorary Secretary (Events)
campaign has produced a choice
selection of five: Nick Allen,
proposed by Laurie McNamee,
fully seconded; New Election,
proposed by Steve Farrant, no
seconder needed; Aled Fenner,
proposed by David Goddard, fully
seconded; Stefan Smith, proposed
by Chris Pease, eight seconders;
and Sarah Harland, proposed by
Steve Newhouse, seven seconders.
The sabbatical campaign is
wound down by the Felix editor
election. The three candidates are:
Jonty Beavan, proposed by Richard
Eyers, fully seconded; New
Election, as before; and Toby
Jones, proposed by Sarah Harland,
fully seconded.
Twenty other students are
standing for non sabbatical posts.
These are handbook editor,
honorary member of council,
academic affairs officer, welfare
officer, external affairs officers, rag
chairman, ents chairman, I C C A G
chairman, U G M chairman,
women's officer and housing
officer.
This information was correct at
the time of writing, though more
recent developments may render
this story innaccurate.
