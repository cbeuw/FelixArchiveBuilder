On Saturday 22nd February, the
Ladies Badminton team set off to
Birmingham for the semi-finals of
the U A U . Our opponent was Exeter
University. It was a bright morning
and we had a fairly comfortable
journey apart from the fact that
there were a few drunken football
supporters on our carriage who
were singing on top of their voices,
(they thought they were good!) It
was nearly 1pm when we arrived at
Birmingham University sports hall.
The mens semis were almost
finished as we watched them dive
madly on court for the last few
Any of you who missed out on the
Science Museum Christmas lecture
(1991), will get a second chance to
see it on Monday, 2nd March in
Elec Eng 408, at 6.30pm. Just
follow the arrows from the Elec
Eng entrance. The good news is
what you would have paid £5 for at
Christmas, you'll get for free with
SEDS - what a great organisation!
Apollo 8 was the first mission to
fly men around the moon, during
Christmas 1968. The mission was
a major step, being only the second
Apollo mission to fly, especially
considering that three astronauts
had died in preparations for the first
points. As Birmingham Uni had
both their mens and ladies teams in
the semis, there was tremendous
support for them. The hall was
filled with loud cheers for the
Birmingham teams. However,
neither were we, in any way,
intimidated nor discouraged.
We went on court, against Exeter
Uni and began our fight for a place
in the finals. Exeter had a very
strong first pair. Although we
fought bravely, we could not match
their skills. The speed of play was
so much faster which took us a long
while to get used to. After a long
Apollo mission a year and a half
earlier.
All went well with the mission,
the first to bring back high quality
movie pictures of the lunar surface,
and 'earth rise' as viewed from the
command module. Just three
missions and a mere seven months
later, man landed on the moon -
Apollo 11, 20th July 1969.
During the talk you will have an
opportunity to see original Apollo
hardware and pictures, together
with film footage of the mission;
which will help to capture the
atmosphere of those pioneering
days...
tiring battle, we were beaten 7-2.
It was a very good experience for
us and even though we lost, we
were satisfied that we had reached
this far. We truly enjoyed the high
standard of badminton there. (We
also saw some England players
there!) When we returned to
London, we rewarded our efforts
by a Chinese meal in Chinatown
(we were starving by then!).
Everybody had an enjoyable time
and are looking forward to next
years U A U .

Huxley
During the summer term the
Huxley Society will be bringing out
an issue of its magazine
EXPERIMENT. We want you to
contribute some writing. The
Huxley Society was set up in the
early '60s to promote the teaching
of T H Huxley and the ideas of
Humanism.
The magazine sets out to examine
life. It takes as its starting point the
idea that beliefs should be
reasonable, and that we should
judge and develop our beliefs by
means of experiment. Such is the
approach of the scientist. The
coming issue will focus on life
experience.
It is a tenet of Humanism that on
the basis of the available evidence,
the probability is that God does not
exist. This renders all religion
invalid; but the absence of religion
leaves a discernible void. What
religions do is to demand blind faith
in one or other God and go on to
present an appropriate body of
wisdom. From this wisdom is
derived a set of principles which we
(the devotees) are to live our lives,
and by which we can increase the
profundity of our existences. A non-
belief in God should not however
diminish the importance of wisdom.
What is required is a wisdom that
has a credible footing. We need to
start from life experience.
Humans exist and emotions exist.
Individually we have ideas about
what is profound and what is
superficial. There is also a good
deal of correlation between the
ideas of different people.
We therefore ask you for writings
about what you consider most
fundamental in life. What has
provided the strongest experience?
When you are in your deathbed
what will you have lived for?
Submit pieces to Sam Stacey,
Civil Eng 1, by 15th March.
