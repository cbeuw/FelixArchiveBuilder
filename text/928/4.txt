The Last Boy Scout
Bruce Willis needs a certain boost
to his career after the abysmal
Bonfire of the Vanities and Hudson
Hawk. This is, in my opinion, his
best outing since Die Hard (the first
one) and although M r Willis still
needs to discover the wonders of
Gillette Sensor, his personality fits
the role of P.I. exceptionally well.
Joe Hallenbeck (Brucie) has not
had a good life. Once one of the
nation's top secret service agents,
he had a run-in with a dirty
politician and one frame-up later,
and Hallenbeck lost his job, his
pension, everything but his gun.
Even his wife's getting hot and
steamy with his best friend and his
daughter draws pictures of Satan-
Claus!! Hallenbeck is now a dirty
two-bit L A P.I. whose best friend
is killed just after having handed
him a small-time case (and having
banged his wife). This small-time
case gets horribly gunned down in
front of her boyfriend (Daman
Wayans) Jimmy Dix. Cue for a
crusade to uncover a conspiracy to
legalise gambling.
Jimmy, has his own problems
bei^g the victim of 'frame-up
united', once football player
extraordinaire, but now someone
who buys 650 dollar leather
trousers.
The interplay between the
detective and the athlete, both
refugees from violent professions
who become targets in an even
more violent world, is what is
probably most interesting and the
script goes far beyond the standard
'two guys who don't like each other
at first, but then...' plotline. What
is appealing about The Last Boy
Scout is that at its heart it's a tale
of redemption. Hallenbeck and Dix
are two lost souls who find
themselves through helping each
other and by joining efforts in a
common cause (sounds shite, eh?),
anyway, Shane Black (screenplay)
writes amazing action scenes; the
characters are so fully drawn that
you can almost smell them and their
environment, and as is now
common-place in films of the hard-
boiled private eye genre (i.e. Die
Hard, Lethal Weapon, Beverly
Hills Cop) it has a very sharp sense
of humour.
It has an 18 certificate so we are
guaranteed plenty of overkill on the
7 swear to God there's a review missing' (c.f. Darwen)
'You fart like that again, I'll blow your God damn face off'
F X side, infinitely better than
Lethal Weapon, Die Hard etc, a
very high blood count, plenty of
close ups on the head shots, all in
all, the best all-out action movie in
ages, one that does Bruce
Moonlighting Willis proud. Even
the Big Bronze Bap says check it
out; it certainly isn't a load of poo.
Poo.
