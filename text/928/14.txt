Manifestos Felix 928 28 February 1992
PRESIDENT Tony Baldwin proposed by Bruce Hall
I am proposing Tony Baldwin as
Union President because he is the
biggest pisshead standing for the
job. Being Real Ale Society
chairman this year he is used to
carrying firkins of ale and should
find no difficulty in carrying off
3,500 copies of Felix should a RAS
review appear. Due to his
unquestionable ability at throwing
up he should also find it remarkably
easy to cover the union concert hall
in sticky gunge. His training in the
diplomatic corp should ensure that
he pisses off a number of people and
should overcome his natural
disadvantage of not being a member
of Dramsoc. Vote Tony he's a
thoroughly fine chap.
Due to the fact that Imperial
College is one of the largest
drinking institutions per capita in
the country I don't believe the
average student cares about
anything other than beer. As
chairman of RAS, longstanding
C A M R A member and beer
connoisseur extraordinaire I believe
I have your interests at heart.
Instead of using the Union bar
profits to subsidise trivial matters,
such as student welfare, ents discos
& gigs and miscellaneous sponges
ie Dramsoc, beer prices would be
slashed. This would enable more
students to continue with their
drinking degree and continue our
high alcoholic reputation. Vote for
me, Tony Baldwin,
fine chap.

PRESIDENT Chris Davidson proposed by Mark Jackson
I am a second year physicist. Last
year I lived in Falmouth Keogh hall
and am now non res.
T H E JOB
The job of ICU president involves
overall organisation of the union
including staff and union officers.
It also includes areas of
responsibility decided by the
president and vice president,
including academic affairs,
accomodation, sport, welfare,
transport and overseas students.
The president also sits on various
college commitees, including
governing body, house commitee
and refectory users commitee. They
also chair I C U exec and
disciplinary.
There are many other small tasks
that the ICU president carries out
including insurance, reciprocal
membership and telephone use.
W H Y ME?
I have a wide ranging experience of
college life and have held several
positions of responsibility, both
elected and non elected. I organised
several functions in Falmouth
Keogh Hall in my first year. I have
also been heavily involved in the
RCSU as a Theta bearer and as
transport officer.
T H E O V E R V I E W
I don't want the job for the power,
the money, or something to do. I
want it because I think I would do
a good job and provide an unbiased
service for all IC and Mary's
students.
Some of my ideas include :-
a) Trying to revamp the housing
lists issued by the accomodation to
make them more user friendly.
b) Try and keep the price of beer
down. Based on our barrelage we
should have prices that reflect other
student union prices.
c) Try to increase the amount of
welfare and academic literature
available in the union office.
Overall I want to run the union
sensibly and for the students.

PRESIDENT Angelo Gardini proposed by Richard Murray
Firstly, I will carry out my
responsibilities professionally and
to the best of my abilities to ensure
that the Union provides the best
service it can for students. I am not
a hack or involved in petty union
wrangling: I want to see the
organisation running as effectively
as possible.
The Union events have been
excellent this year, but
improvements in outlets are due.
The aspect of what the Union is
supposed to do but does not do very
well is to provide a
'communications network' for
students to voice their views and for
the Union to try and solve the
problems and represent the student
view to College management.
The Union structure is very
complex, with many committees
and procedures. This deters
students from getting involved. The
Union must be made more
accessible to students and
responsive to problems. I have
learned, through Chairing a
(Huxley) society, that teamwork,
cooperation and communication are
key—both within the Union and
between the Union and students and
the Union and College. I would
hope that College would also be
more open and that we could
cooperate—where possible: If we
think what College is proposing is
reasonable. IF not, and the only
course is for "industrial relations"
to break down, then so be it.
I propose that there be a weekly,
informal meeting between Union
officers and students to highlight
problems and to discuss ideas. Felix
will be key to keeping students
informed and "opening up" the
Union. I propose a regular page in
Felix where we will keep students
informed—both generally about
what the Union is doing and also
what was discussed in those
informal meetings and any progress
made. Thus, a dialogue would start
and problems would be solved
quicker.
