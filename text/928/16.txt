Manifestos Felix 928 28 February 1992
HON SEC (EVENTS) Aled Fenner proposed by D Goddard
I'll be as brief as possible;
1) B A L A N C E ! I don't know if
you are a house/rave addict but I
believe that IC events have been
excessively biased towards this
recently, there are other musical
tastes around, we ought to have a
mixture so it averages out with
something for everyone. We need
a 'suggestions box' so that your
ideas can be used as IC events.
2) Bar Extensions; we could get
a late license for the union bar
which means that we could have as
many extensions as we want, nice
huh? I think we ought to push to
aquire this.
3) Gigs, more top name bands?
4) I.C. Film soc and Sci-Fi joint
productions? We could turn the
Concert Hall into a regular cinema
showing good, recent films at
reasonable prices.
OK these are the basic concepts that
I have. The reasons that you should
trust me are that I am friendly,
approachable and have a working
knowledge of the way that the
Union works.
I'm on good terms with most of
the people that I would work with
and I've never smashed a piano in
my life. Elect me and I'll do my
best for you.
Aled Fenner, easier to get hold
of than Heroin and a lot easier to
hhhhandle. For a sense of balance
and fun please vote for me.
This is the bit where I, the proposer,
tell you all what a great guy Aled
is and how good he will be at the
job. Aled's a great guy, and he'll
be excellent at the job. Felix are
very stingy about how many words
I can put in, so I'll probably be cut
off in mid senten
FELIX EDITOR Jonty Beavan proposed by Richard Eyers
Felix is regarded by too many
students outside the Union Building
as irrelevant to them. This will not
change until more Imperial and St
Mary's students become involved in
what happens in Felix and the print
unit. I will try and make Felix more
representative in several ways;
Reviews Felix receives tickets to all
national film releases and most of
the theatres in West London. This
is far too much information to be
included in 2 or 3 reviews pages.
I would expand the 'what's on'
section to provide a proper
entertainments guide to our part of
London.
Music Music pages will cover a
broader range of music; this could
include rock, cajun and shock,
horror, even classical music.
Features I would ensure Felix
initiated debate, by performing its
own investigations, drawn from a
range of points of view not just the
same old people having a go at each
other again.
News As news editor I have helped
to set up Imperial College News
Network (iCNN) which is all three
college media (IC Radio, STOIC
and Felix) working together to
cover news. I think shall expand
this to include communications with
other Student Newspapers and
Universities.
This will not be enough to get
students involved in Felix. This can
only be done by making Felix more
accessible to every student. I intend
to hold meetings outside the Felix
Office to get feedback on how
people feel about our newspaper.
All I need is your support and your
vote. It only takes 3'/2 seconds.
FELIX EDITOR Toby Jones proposed by Sarah Harland
Toby is one of the originals. He
walked into the Felix office on the
first day of his first year, and never
escaped. In that time he's mastered
everything, from writing to
wrangling, and is one of the few to
have mastered the fiendish
typesetter. He has the three qualities
for an Editor - wit, diplomacy and
insomnia.
If in doubt, ask Toby.
Felix
It is important that Felix informs
and entertains. To continue to
deliver high quality, in-depth news,
I will be backing the news network
iCNN, which unites Felix, Stoic
and IC Radio. In addition, the
What's On page will gain new life,
with closer liaison with clubs and
Ents.
A lively letters page, prize
competitions, and controversial
reviews could be a recipe for an
interesting read during boring
Friday mornings. Felix doesn't
carry enough cartoons or humorous
articles - I could blindly promise
more but it's only possible to print
the material received. Making the
Felix office less imposing would
encourage students to submit their
work; I will strive to make visitors
welcome and give encouragement
to budding authors.
Giving you the opportunity to
voice an opinion is a theme close
to the heart of Felix. I won't hide
in the office, but visit Silwood,
St.Mary's and departments around
college.
Print Unit
The print unit is currently under
heavy demand and clubs are losing
out on publicity. I am confident that
a better service can be offered so
I will be working towards making
the print unit into a separate Union
outlet. This would leave the Felix
Editor to concentrate on producing
a top quality paper whilst ensuring
that Union print work is processed
promptly.
Vote for a Felix worth stealing:
Toby Jones
