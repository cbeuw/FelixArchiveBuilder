28 February 1992 Felix 928 Feature
Dawn broke gently over the
sprawling city of Damascus and the
cars began to prick the fresh pink
morning with their tinny horns.
On the eighth floor of a grimy
hotel just off of Martyrs Square I
was sleeping peacefully. The fan
hummed quietly and the cool air
made the curtains billow across the
open window.
The muezzin from a nearby
mosque began the call to prayer and
his words floated mournfully
through the quiet streets. One by
one other voices joined in until the
morning sky became a haunting
table of exultation.
I opened a reluctant eye to look
at my watch, not wanting to dispel
the fleeting world of semi-sleep that
I was currently revelling in. It was
a little after 5.00am.
Slowly I became aware of another
presence in the room, something
was moving around. A scratching
noise came from the other bed, over
which my luggage was strewn. I
opened my eyes and half sat up. The
confronted by a bearded man in his
twenties wearing jeans and a t-shirt.
Across his chest he held a
Kalashnikov assault rifle. I stood in
front of him feeling a little
nonplussed. He pushed me out of
the way with a helpful shove from
the butt of his AK47.
Half asleep as I was, it suddenly
dawned on me what he wanted.
Obviously he had come to shoot the
eat.
At 5.00am, having just been
rudely awoken it seemed perfectly
reasonable to me that any thoughtful
hotel manager worth his salt would
regularly send round young men
armed with machine guns to check
for stray cats. I began to say 'No
really. It's ok, the cat wasn't any
trouble, you mustn't shoot...'

Calcutta
cat that had been clawing my newly
cleaned trousers froze like a statue,
glaring at me with frantic eyes.
1 barely had time to register what
was happening when, without
warning, the cat leapt straight
through the open window. It didn't
even touch the frame.
I layed back on my bed and tried
to remember whether or not there
was a balcony outside. Seconds-
later, as I was slipping back into the
cosy arms of sleep, there was a
sharp hammering at the door. I
swore and got foggily out of bed.
The hammering got louder. When
1 eventually got the door open I was
My voice trailled off as he started
going through my bags with one
hand. The other hand was on his
trigger. I stood in my boxer shorts
and watched.
When he had finished he walked
straight to the door and without
looking at me just said 'Police'. He
closed the door and I heard his
footsteps echo down the hallway.
,' -I scratched my head, walked over
to the window and leant out. Eight
floors below an old man was talking
to a taxi driver as he tried to get a
dead cat off of the roof of his
pavement stall. There wasn't a
balcony after all.
My first memory of Calcutta after
leaving Howrah Station was
walking over the huge Howrah
Bridge which spans the Hooghly
River.
The bridge is a squat construction
of girders that hangs over the river
in a grey fog of its own pollution.
Cars, buses and lorries thunder over
it tangled up in the screams of their
own horns and the wailing of their
own engines. From a distance it
could almost be condensing from
the vicious gut of cloud around it.
A slow accretion of waste, both
material and human.
The sidewalks were black
tarmac, dusty and spattered with big
clots of mucus that lay like open
oysters. I stepped over beggars who
had no limbs, just lay on
newspapers, not even bothering to
beg anymore. Slowly they are
becoming a part of the bridge, their
skins are turning the same shade of
grey as the girders that they slump
against. They are petrifying under
layers of poison, fossilising, turning
into gargoyles.
People bumped into me and
didn't notice, they bumped into
each other, trod on beggars, spat on
the road, pissed on the pavement.
Porters ran backwards and forwards
with huge loads on their heads,
sweating. Their sandals clicked like
ticking clocks. They swore, pushed
people out of the way, raced each
other and then were gone,
swallowed in the noise and dust that
bound itself around them like twine.
Halfway over the bridge, a man
stood silent and motionless, not
even blinking in the hellish
confusion. People jostled all around
but he didn't move, he just stood
and stared out across the Hooghly.
His rags flapped in the thick wind
and the foot-long thread of mucus
that hung from his nose swung like
a pendulum. He just stood and
stared. He was an empty shell, like
he was made of sand. I felt that I
could flick him and he would
crumble away into nothing. He
watched the hazy buildings
compressed by the heavy brown
sky. He watched the Hooghly run
under him, textured like vomit and
all the while there was nothing in
his eyes. They were an absence, the
emotion of loss. They were as
hollow and empty as the space left
by a missing child.
In a second he had disappeared
behind me amongst the swallowing
tides of people and I was swept on
towards the waiting city.
As I stepped out from the stifling
framework of the bridge the
atmosphere began to thin slightly.
The metallic greys drifted into the
malignant browns and yellows of
endless lines of buildings. They
stood in uneven rows like rotting
teeth. Cars and buses flowed around
them in angry currents that snarled
and fought with serpentine frenzy.
In front of me a man blocked the
narrow path as he leant against a
wall and urinated. As he finished a
taxi pulled up alongside me and the
driver wound down the window.
'Welcome to Calcutta, I take you
somewhere nice. T looked at the
scene around me and doubted that
very much indeed.
