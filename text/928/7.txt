28 February 1992 Felix 928 Music
Thousand Yard Stare —Hands On
Thousand Yard Stare in swirly picture shock.
The most coveted C D to be thrust
into Felix's paws for many moons,
TYS open with 0-0 a.e.t., in which
the lead singer, Stephen, prattles on
about the end of a relationship in
terms of footballing metaphors,
while the rest of the band try to
work out how to recreate that
authentic Wonder Stuff sound. The
thought occurs that it might be his
obsession with football which
caused the end of it... Skipping over
Thisness, in which he gets over it,
and finds a rhyme for ancestry, and
the lads figure out that Stuffie
sound, and onto the latest single,
Comeuppance, a track which goes
on too long.
Cottager is about how he feels
abut England, for TYS are typically
English; The boys get into a more
jangly feel, which they retain for a
redone Seasonstream. Dominic the
drummer does some additional
vocals on this track, so to retain
balance the next track is an
instrumental, with the shipping
forecast at the start.
Nonplussed was presumably
some other reviewer's opinion of
the track of that name, and
Absentee returns to the 0-0 a.e.t.
style, both thematically and
musically, albeit slightly slower,
and somewhat devoid of football.
Last Up, First To Go is where the
lads really discover the Eight
Legged Groove Machine, and Steve
campaigns for the (totally
justifiable) demolition of the
Hammersmith Odeon, shitty venue
and host nation of the 1992 brits
awards.
Drawing to a close, with another
e.p. cut, Buttermouth, which makes
very little sense lyrically, and is
distinctly indie- rockie. Wideshire
is where our Stephen sings about
"aspiring to greatness in the
afternoon' and the lads bring the
album to a close.
Well Aard.

Silverfish - ULU
When you go to a gig, do you
expect to see a man set himself on
fire? This is not a prize question,
it's rhetorical. (No it's not, Mr. B.,
it's a potato.)
No, you don't. We did when we
went to see Silverfish. He is a
professional fireman, so don't try
this at home, kids.
Silverfish have thus gained
themselves a place in the hall of
f(l)ame. And they deserve it. They
actually earned it through the
indisputable fact that their caustic
sound is of cosmic proportions.
Lesley prancing around stage in a
nightie, like a Scottish whirlwind,
is also a majorly frightening
experience, enough to scare any
reviewer into giving a good review,
especially when you see her up
close. U L U is too small a venue to
reasonably expect to contain such
a fearsome character. The cunning
ploy of making us stay to the end
to hear Hips, Tits, Lips, Power and
Total Fucking Asshole forcing us to
see the entire set, instead of slinking
off to the bar would work for any
other band. Take note, lesser
mortals.
Incidentally, has anyone noticed
that Creation are taking over the
indie charts? (Rhetorical, darlings)
