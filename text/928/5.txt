Life Support
There are those fringe shows that
just don't have it. When the
production might as well be done
at a big theatre—only it would be
better at a big theatre. When being
small is just an excuse for not being
good enough. Life Support by the
Parti Pris Theatre Company is not
one of those.
The short play is set in a hospital
during visiting hour. It consists of
four separate scenes with four
patients and their visitors. The play
describes the loneliness and
isolation of hospital life: 'Have you
brought me me needles?' He has,
in a bag, but there's only one.
'What am I supposed to do with one
needle?'—'Knit.'—'You need two.
That's the standard. That's how it's
done.'
But the patients experience also
the comfort of peace and quiet and
the relief to get away from the
hassle of life: the hospital as an
intermediate and not all unpleasant
stage between life and death. It is
this ambiguity that makes it possible
for the show to be depressing and
funny at the same time. The
characters are simple but so well
and lovingly acted that they do not
collapse into cliches.
What is really special about this
production, however, is the
amazing and innovative use of the
stage props and the integration of
dance and noise. Instead of a curtain
The Roadshow
comes to town and we follow a
couple of youngsters getting ready
and excited on their way to this
'mega-almighty' event. As the play
progresses we realise that there is
more to this festival than music and
sexual intrigues. It becomes
increasingly clear that the pressure
of hedonism can be lethal.
The highlight of the play is the
well performed scene enacting the
horror of making decisions at a
hectic burger bar.
Walking down the stairs after the
play you think: what was this? A
new edition of the Brave New
World theme of a monster-state?
DJ-hero Smooch as Big Brother?
The whole plot remains rather
nebulous. The poor acting is
compounded by the cliches of the
script, which is their exaggeration
and not even funny.
Anyway, if you want to see for
yourself, in the tiny but personal
venue of the Etcetera Theatre, 265
Camden High St, take bus 31 or
tube (Camden) and pay £ 4
(concessions) plus 75p
membership.

Death and the
Maiden
Death and the Maiden is set in a
Latin American country and is
about a nervous and paranoid
woman called Paulina (played by
Juliet Stevenson). She had been
reduced to the pathetic state by the
tragic events of fifteen years
previously.
• The years of a cruel dictatorship
had left Paulina powerless to bring
the perpetrators to justice. The hope
of a new era hits the country like
a wave and with it Paulina's desire
for immediate justice, which a
they have one of those folding
hospital screens on rolls. In the end,
a whole surrealist scenery is created
with just a hospital bed and its
covers. This show can only work
on a small stage and it shows what
an advantage a small stage can be.

government in turmoil cannot
provide.
Paulina's husband Gerardo
(played by Bill Patterson), a
prominent official in the new
government, observes his wife's
irrational behaviour as a seemingly
innocent man Roberto (played by
Michael Byrne) becomes the victim
of Paulina's vengeful obsession.
Death and the Maiden is a
gripping play which tackles
important political issues on a
personal level. The play was a
clever look at the turmoil and
uncertainty a new democracy
inevitably produces. Many
questions were left unanswered
allowing the audience to draw its
own conclusions.
All three performances were
convincing, especially the portrayal
of the complex character of Paulina
by Juliet Stevenson, which was
brilliant. This is a play which is
definitely worth going to see, in
fact, it should not be missed.
Death and the Maiden has just
opened at the Duke of York where
the price of tickets range from £5
to £18. Student standbys can usually
be obtained half an hour before the
performance. Box Office 071-5122.

You are Yegor Gloumov. You
are a man with style, intelligence,
good looks, and a sharp wit. All you
lack is money. Oh yes... and a
conscience. Armed with these lethal
weapons, and in alliance with your
mother, what do you do? What will
your ambitious soul start to crave
for?
Power. Money. Standing in
society. Sofar, so good, we have an
intriguing story of that rarity; an
intelligent politician, and a very
dangerous man. He, fortunately for
the rest of the inhabited world, has
a flaw.
Any man who lives a life of lies,
whose very face is constantly
showing false emotion, must have
some point of reference which he
can regard as truth. Yegor Gloumov
uses his diary to express his true
feelings, and hold onto his true
feelings. This is a useful device, not
only in that it prevents insanity
setting in, but also, it provides a
handy plot device for Yegor's
paper-thin world of lies to break
down and fall about him.
Upon discovery of the diary, all
proclaim that they had never trusted
him, and that he was no longer
welcome in polite society. He turns
this around by pointing out
everybody elses lies to each other,
and opening up so many secrets that
nobody has reason to blame
anybody else.
The production was by Stage
Right, a London amateur dramatics
group. The presentation was in the
amateur (but in the nicest possible
way). Delivery was not always
perfect, and recovery after lost lines
was a little stilted, but the rapport
between the members of the staff
was excellent, and the witty
conversations flowed fast and
furious with hardly a break.
Finally, names to look out for.
Outstanding performances were
given by Jonathan Lewsey as
Kroutitsky, the doddering fool, and
Ginny Statham a Madame
Tourousina, the religious nut.
Finally the plug. If you are
