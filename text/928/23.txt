Indoor Soccer Tournament
The Imperial College Indoor Soccer
Tournament duly got under way this
week, with the first game played on
Tuesday. In all, 23 teams entered
the competition, rather more than
I had anticipated. This meant that
the first phase of the event would
involve 5 groups having 4 teams
and one group having 3 teams. With
all the teams entered by the 5pm
deadline of Monday evening, the
draw was made at 5.15pm.
The fixture arrangement for
Week 1 meant that games would be
played on Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday and Saturday. At the
point of writing this, the results for
Tuesday and Wednesday have been
published, as well as the group
standings of the teams that have
played games.
Also shown in the adjoining
tables are the fixtures for Week 2.
So could all the participating teams
NEXT WEEK'S FIXTURES
take note of the times when they are
due to play, and turn up at least 10
minutes prior to kick-off.
I would also like to draw attention
to a few rule changes caused by the
extra number of teams entered.
Firstly, the top teams from each
group qualify for the knock-out
stages, plus the two best runner-
ups. Secondly, the matches will
now be played over two halves of
12.5 minutes each. There was also
a typing error within rule 6.5,
which should have implied that the
ball cannot go above head height.
Finally, due to the Nat West
branch manager being away on
holiday, I have been unable to
ascertain the outcome of our
proposal for sponsorship.
Hopefully, I shall know by next
week, when all the details shall be
published in FELIX.
Khurrum.
