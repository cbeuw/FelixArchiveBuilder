Feature Felix 928 28 February 1992
To most people at the College who get the chance to see the internal
telephone directory you are merely a name with a connected room
and telephone number. Over the past term a number of students have
asked me what Mr so-and-so actually does, and I frankly do not know.
Many students have remarked on the serried ranks of numbered boxes
that comprise the Sherfield building and wonder what the people inside
them actually do. The names above may appear rather random, but
they are the most commonly questioned College personalities, covering
most aspects of the College.
If you would like to enlighten the students and staff of IC could you
send me a short piece of 100 words or thereabouts detailing such facts
as what your present job entails - what you actually do - with its
relevance to students at the college. As a guide of what else could be
included, you could write about how long you have been at IC, how
long you have been in your present job, what you were doing
previously, what you think your main achievement has been whilst
you have been here, what your main objectives are for the future and
what, roughly, your background is.
Naturally, you are at complete liberty not to respond to this, or not
to answer any one of the above questions. The results of this survey
will be printed in the Felix of February 28, if enough responses are
forthcoming by Monday 24 February this year. All the responses will
be printed verbatim.
On the 20th January this letter was sent out to the members of the College
named below. My thanks are extended to those who responded, and a
supplement to these results may be published if more answers are returned.

Professor J S Archer
Pro Rector
(since September 1991, in
succession to Professor Bryan
Coles, FRS)
The Pro Rector is essentially the
deputy for the Rector and is thus
concerned with a wide range of
academic and administrative
matters which influence the College
environment for staff and students.
There are however some particular
duties for which the Pro Rector has
responsibility—namely the conduct
of Academic Promotions (with the
Deans) and the control of finances
connected with equipment and the
academic development reserve. The
academic promotions help develop
and retain high quality teachers and
researchers at the College and the
results therefore have a direct
influence on the quality of education
for our students.
The Pro Rector has another
emerging role to play in helping
smooth the interface between
academic and administrative issues.
Academic management tends to
operate through committees and the
Pro Rector chairs a new one aimed
at increasing the influence of Heads
of Departments in key decision
making. The Heads of Academic
Departments Advisory Committee
is an important link between the
Heads of Academic Departments
and the M P G (Management
Planning Group) which advises the
Rector on short term and strategic
issues. Another role which the Pro
Rector believes is important is to
work with the Deans and Heads of
Departments in bringing a wide
range of views to bear on strategic
development and planning in the
College.
In the course of carrying out these
duties the Pro Rector is in frequent
contact with Student Union
Officials, College Tutors and a wide
spectrum of members of the
College. The Pro Rector's office is
on the 5th floor of the Sherfield
Building and he has administrative
and clerical support from Jenny
Lewis and Vicki Cowan.

Manager/Accommodation and

September, 1990 as Business

matters relating to residences to
Conference facilities.

Dr R F Eastwood
Director of Planning and
Management Information
Services
My job is centred around the
process of developing the College's
academic, financial and estates
plans. This involves liaison with the
Universities Funding Council who
give us our main grant, negotiating
with external organisations who
have, or would like a financial
interest in the College, exploring
variations in the way we distribute
resources to departments within the
College and discussing with
departments the implications of
their plans. Just as much academic
work is becoming more
interdisciplinary, so is some
administrative activity and I work
closely with colleagues in all the
other administrative divisions. We
also run the main administrative
computing software systems of the
College—Finance, Payroll,
Personnel, Registry and Estates and
also provide this service to two
other Schools of the University.
I have worked in the College
since December 1987 coming from
the Natural History Museum. My
academic background is in biology,
specifically neurophysiology.

Ms C L Fox
Directpr, Personnel and
Administrative Services
Immediately before joining Imperial
College, two years ago, I took three
years out from a career in the
University of London, on
secondment to the Department of
Health, where I was responsible for
Training and Education policy.
As Director of Personnel and
Administrative Services, much of
my time is spent on 'staff affairs',
but three areas of the Division are
of special interest to students. I am
responsible for the Safety Unit and
its staff, Ian Gillett, Martin Jones
and Christine Wright, and advise
the Rector on College Health and
Safety, the Catering Department,
managed by Simon Westerman, and
the 'youngest students' of the
College, the members of the Day
Nursery, looked after by Sue
Thornett and her staff.
Over the last two years, I have
developed the College's Health and
Safety arrangements, the impact of
which is just beginning to be felt by
Academic Departments. The Day
Nursery recently celebrated its 21st
birthday and will soon be returning
from Week's Hall to its revamped
home at 9, Prince's Gardens.
Mr A S J Fraser

Angus Fraser—Managing Director
—joined IC in November 1989 after
21 years in industry/commerce,
including four years as public
company director—responsible to
the Rector for the efficient running
of the Central Administration,
which is dedicated to giving first
class support for the academic
activities of the College and to
providing an improving range of
amenities and services to staff and
students.

Mandy Hurford
Union Manager
I have been at Imperial College
Union for 15 months. Previous to
this I have done the same work for
eight years in two other colleges.
Following the major refurbishment
of the Union Building last summer
I would see my main objective
being to encourage and facilitate
much greater student involvement
and participation in the Union and
its services. A second objective
would be to open up better channels
of communication with College
staff and to provide continuity
within the annually changing
sabbatical and committee network.
Personnel
This includes overseeing the
administration of all staff
recruitment and dismissal
procedures, staff training and
development, staff personnel and
staff meetings. With the Union
employing over thirty people this is
an important part of the job.
House
This includes organising all repairs
and maintenance and advising and
negotiating with external
contractors for developments and
improvements to the Union
Building in consultation with
College.
Finance and General
Administration
This means ensuring that the
Union's financial procedures are
properly maintained and that
expenditure is controlled to
previously agreed budgets.
Trading
This entails monitoring all the
Union's trading outlets in such a
way as to provide a good service to
our students and still be financially
viable. The Union Manager is also
one of the two Licencees of the
Union Bar and as such is
