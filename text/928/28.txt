The settlement between the College
Unions and Management over the
rearrangement of the messenger,
security and car park (MSCP)
services around the College is said
to have left the affected workforce
uneasy. The agreement is regarded
by some sections as a Union
'sellout', with concern centering on
new shift patterns. Other sources
have told Imperial College News
Network, iCNN, that the Unions
have negotiated the agreement
which College management wanted
all along, though this ignores the
existence of confidential documents
in which Estates Director, Gordon
Marshall, states his preference for
contracting out, or privatisation, of
the MSCP services.
John Payne, IC Employee
Relations Manager, complained to
Felix about last week's news story
on a possible deadlock on M S C P
privatisation talks. He said that 'as
usual, Felix had got it all wrong,'
though eventually conceded that
he objected to the word 'deadlock.'
The reporter responsible for the
story has said that the usage of
Imperial College has been awarded
a 19.9% increase in the University
Funding Council (UFC) research
grant.
The College also received an
increase in its teaching funds of
3.2%, bringing the total for
1992/93 to £56.6 million, an
Levels of student poverty have
provoked a furious row this week
between Fleet Street tabloids and
the B B C . The storm followed a
report broadcast by the Nine
o'Clock News on Wednesday 12th
February, which suggested that
levels of debt were forcing students
to withdraw from their courses.
The BBC featured Vicky Byrne,
who left Reading University last
year after running up a fifteen
hundred pound debt. Ms Byrne was
reported to be cleaning houses for
a living, and was intending to return
to Reading after her debt had been
paid off.
The report was followed a week
later by a two page analysis in the
London Evening Standard, which
alleged ,#iat the report was biased
and 'distorted'. The claims of bias
led to the tabling of an Early Day
motion in the House of Commons
by Edwina Currie, which has
attracted thirteen signatures. The
motion was highly critical of the
West Midlands Police have arrested
a former student of Imperial
College, Michael Newman, for
attempting to sell a banned video.
A plain clothed officer arrested him
as he was about to sell a copy of
'Visions of Ecstasy', an 18 minute
film about St Teresa of Avila. He
was later released. Talking to Felix,
Mr Newman said that the policeman
who offered to buy the video looked
like 'a dirty old man,' and when
they agreed to the sale the officer
'sadly showed me his badge.'
Mr Newman explained that he
was in Birmingham to launch and
promote a Humanist leaflet directed
at school children. This encouraged
groups of non-Christians to opt out
of religious assemblies as part of a
greater campaign to encourage
debate in individual schools to
'deadlock' was unfortunate, but that
both sides had encountered
difficulties in the talks.
Keith Reynolds, IC Chief
Security Officer, told Felix that an
announcement on the final plan is
to be expected next week.
increase of 11% overall. This
compares with the total funding for
the University of London of
£370.23 million, with increases of
6.1% in teaching funds and 13.7%
in research funds - a 9.9% overall
increase - and the national average
research funding increase of 11 %.
BBC, and follows comments from
the Home Secretary, Kenneth
Baker, that the BBC would have to
be 'very careful indeed' over the
way it intended to cover the general
election. The motion will not now
be debated.
The B B C responded vigorously
to the allegations by consulting its
lawyers over The Standard's
claims, repeated in the Daily
Express and the Sun, and by writing
to each of the signatories of the
motion. The legal advice given
indicated that the Corporation
would win any libel action, but the
reporter, Mike Baker, said that he
did not think it was appropriate to
issue writs.
Speaking to iCNN, the editor of
the Daily Express, Sir Nicholas
Lloyd, said that 'we stand by our
story'. When told that the BBC had
issued a similar statement, he said
that the B B C always back their
stories, because in their opinion,
they are never wrong. (iCNN)
ascertain whether they choose 'a
determination.' This is the legal
way in which schools can decide
whether to run religious assemblies.
Mr Newman stated T believe the
divinity of Christ is a threat to our
humanity.'
Mr Newman was a founder
member and chairman of IC
Union's T H Huxley Society, is an
executive member of the British
Humanist Association and has stood
in previous Union Sabbatical
elections. He decided to sell the
video, which shows the Spanish
saint erotically caressing Christ on
the cross, after being told that it was
illegal to show it.
The video was banned three years
ago by the British Board of Film
Classification on the grounds of
blasphemy. In this country,
IC Union president, Zoe Hellinger,
announced plans this week for a
Union-organised postal vote
registration campaign. The
campaign has been formulated in
the increasing likelihood of the
General Election occurring during
the Easter vacation.
Speaking to Imperial College
News Network, i C N N , Ms
Hellinger said that she felt very
strongly that students should vote in
the constituency that would
maximise the effect of the student
vote. A Union ad-hoc committee is
to begin work on the campaign next
week.
Postal votes can take one of two
forms. There is the permanent
postal vote, which can be applied
for at any time up to the
announcement of the election date,
and which can be used for an
election on any date. The second
type is the temporary postal vote,
which applies to an election on a
specific date, and which can be
applied for once the date is
announced. Electors have until
thirteen days before polling day to
apply and return the form.
Students are one of a number of
groups who can apply for a postal
vote. This is because students are
entitled to vote either at their college
residence, or at their parental home.
Electoral returning officers have
emphasised that it is illegal to vote
in both places. They are particularly
concerned that first year students,
who are automatically registered at
their halls of residence, may also try
to register at their parental address.
All three mainstream political
parties claim to be unconcerned by
the election falling during the
blasphemy is a criminal offence
which applies only to Christianity.
A police spokesman said 'the matter
is being referred to the Crown
Prosecution Service for possible
offences under the Obscene
Publications Act, the Video
Recordings Act and the common
law on Blasphemy.'
Mr Newman was reported to be
deeply satisfied by his arrest and
afterwards declared himself to be
delighted with his protest against the
blasphemy laws. Expressing his
hopes for a trial, he said T laughed
when I was arrested, but I felt sorry
for the police who had to watch the
video because it's very boring.' Mr
Newman added that the whole
episode was very 'Monty Python.'

vacation. Ben Rich, from the
Liberal Democrat policy unit, told
iCNN that there is no reason for
students not to vote during the
vacation. However, he added that
if they didn't vote, the main losers
would be 'anti-Tory' parties. M r
Rich felt that this issue had 'been
blown up a bit'.
For Labour, Kate Cinnamon said
'we have taken various steps to
ensure that students know how
important it is to register. There is
no evidence holiday elections affect
the student vote. Students are
registered where the vote matters
most.'
Vanessa Ford, press officer at
Conservative Central Office, told
i C N N 'we would encourage
students to register'. She added that
as the student vote was mainly anti
Conservative, a vacation election
would benefit the Conservative
party. However, Ms Ford denied
that this factor would be taken into
consideration by Mr Major when he
decides the election date.
The temporary vote form, the
RPF9a, can be obtained by
individual students from their local
town hall. This form is then
returned to the electoral returning
officer at the appropriate address:
