Feature Felix 928 28 February 1992
Three years ago, I read in Felix
a report about a national study of
stress amongst students. The article
suggested a number of factors
which led to high stress levels.
These included living in a big city,
worries about money, difficulties
with accommodation, high work
loads, and an uneven ratio between
men and women. The conclusion
was that a fair description of
Imperial College was 'stress city'.
Perhaps above all, the article
(Sherfield Ante-Room, between the
lifts and the dining room on the
ground floor). It is free to wander
around and the pictures will be for
sale.
The Arts Week...Classics
Classical music will be performed
outside the Senior Common Room
(Sherfield Building) most
lunchtimes for your enjoyment.

to something a little more
sophisticated. Alternatively a string

highlighted a theme which runs
through most of the factors causing
stress amongst students-
imbalance, i.e. too much work, not
enough leisure; too many men, not
enough women; too high prices, not
enough good accommodation; etc.
It is often said that you should eat
a balanced diet to remain healthy.
Surely this principle should be
extended to all aspects of life, for
example, getting a balance between
work and leisure.
Two years ago the idea of having
an arts festival within college was
conceived by some members of the
West London Chaplaincy. The
Arts Week is now about to run for
its third year, as a week to celebrate
the Arts and Music.
Within a college that focuses all
its studies on Science and
Technology the Arts can be lost
from everyday life. The Arts Week
doesn't claim to be the cure for all
your stress but it aims to open up
the Arts to as many students (and
staff) as possible, perhaps helping
to restore some balance to our lives.
The Arts Week can also provide a
forum for artists within colleges to
perform (contact Paul Brice if you
wish to on internal 8633).
The Arts Week...Gallery
Pictures and paintings will be
exhibited in the Consort Gallery
quartet and a flute duet will perform
in the Union Building Foyer at
lunchtimes.
The Arts Week...Gigs
A couple of bands will be playing
this year in the Mech Eng Foyer.
One will be Fresh Claim who have
played at The Arts Week twice
before.
The Arts Week...Comedy
Poets and comedians will be
entertaining around college and
possibly in college bars. What a
lark!
The Arts Week...Busking
Perhaps above all The Arts Week
is about trying ot the Arts for
yourselves. So if you fancy
juggling, singing, clowning,
reciting poetry, pavement artistry
etc give it a go during The Arts
Week (contact Toni Briggs on
8633).
Many of the artists who are
performing or exhibiting their work
are Christian, some perform at
established events like Greenbelt.
But don't worry they won't be
ramming the Gospel down your
throat, just putting their effort into
improving the quality of your life.
All The Arts Week events are free.
