Is that your PhD on the floor, or mine?
hopeless piece of research which
interests you less than accountancy.
Then finally you find your dream
project. You don't know much
about gold mineralisation in
Indonesia at this stage, but then
you're not supposed to. You'll soon
have a degree in Geology and with
the enthusiasm you've exuded at the
interview you've developed an
instant rapport with the tutor. A
mining company is sponsoring it
and fieldwork is essential. It's easy
to get carried away at this stage.
However eight weeks into it your
initial reading has simply
demonstrated the lack of knowledge
about the area. You could copy
other peoples' methods. After all
you'd still get different results and
that would probably fit the loose
definition of a PhD.
But how do you measure isotopic
compositions of fluid inclusions,
with just an Apple Mac and a
microfiche reader? Anyone know
where I can borrow a mass
spectrometer from? Ah...there's
one at Bristol. but it costs £ 2 0 per
sample and your meagre funding
barely covers the maintenance.
'Damn, I wish I'd asked about these
little details at the interview. It
might sound obvious to check such
things: but most assume that
appropriate analytical instruments
are adequate funding are
prerequisites; they're not! But never
mind, there must be some way of
investigating paleo-temperatures
with a microfiche reader, it's just
that I haven't done enough reading
yet!'
With your head buried in the sand
you sit in the library for another
eight weeks waiting for your
supervisor to hand over the
compass.
Sadly that moment might never
come. Gullible students are swept
off their feet by cunning
supervisors, with false promises of
dedicated nurturing—to bring the
'little baby' to fruition. But as soon
as you've completed registration
you begin to wonder if you are
sharing the project with Lord
Lucan. In six months you've seen

more of Elvis Presley than that man
who interviewed you. 'Watch out
for Strangers' says the crime watch
poster in the corridor. Underneath
some distraught student has written
'It could be your supervisor'. But
have no fear, you won't be left
alone forever. The stranger is
guaranteed to return from a six
month lecture tour of Borneo just
in time to put their name on the
paper you've dedicated eighteen
months of blood, stress and toil to.
Weekly or monthly supervision
isn't for everyone. Many mature
students flourish in neglect. But if
you're the sort who needs some
guidance then make a point of
talking to students with projects
already fathered by your
prospective supervisor. If they still
aren't 'Dr.' after seven years of
'supervision' then forget it. The
'partnership' of a PhD is not
intended till death you do part. In
general the more eminent the
supervisor the less chance there is
of them being there when you need
them. You'll probably have to trail
blaze with just a 'gut feeling' that
you're right for months at a time.
Surrogate mothers, prepared to
conceive and carry a PhD to
fruition, only to hand over the
doctorate at the end, are still a long
way off. It can be a long and lonely
path to a PhD, and it's not for those
who have 'nothing better to do'.
Over a thousand days of self-
motivation requires something more
than just a passing interest from
both the student and the tutor. Until
prospective supervisors are assessed
on their supervisory skills, and not
the number of committees and
editorial boards they sit on, the
number of neglected PhDs,
terminated before birth, will
continue to rise.
