Feature Felix 928 28 February 1992
You may think
you're safe in
your nice warm
snug lecture
theatre, hut
there are things
afoot out there,
for instance...
Another boring 9.30am lecture?
Want something to brighten up
today? How does playing leapfrog-
draughts against a team of
beauticians, meeting Boy George
and being on T V sound?
Sounds good? Well stop reading
this and get over to Covent Garden
as soon as possible (you can copy
up this morning's notes when you
return). If you're already in a
lecture, then you can still come
along at 10.30am to get a piece of
the action: don't worry about
finding us once you get to Covent
Garden - you're hardly going to
miss a team of beauticians, Boy
George and national T V .
Still reading? Well stop and get
over to Covent Garden now! If
you're wondering why everyone
has just gone hopping mad, it's
because this is Oxfam's 50th
anniversary year and tomorrow,
This is happening now
29th February is leap day and the
two occasions have been combined,
so the whole country will be leaping
for Oxfam - what better excuse do
you need to have a couple of days
of complete madness?
You should be sitting on the tube
to Covent Garden reading this by
now, so relax and read the next bit
on your journey.
If you think leap frog draughts is
mad, it's only a publicity stunt to
catch tomorrow's papers; Saturday
is going to be bigger, better and,
yes, even more silly. The event at
Battersea Park on Saturday morning
(mentioned in last week's Felix) is
unfortunately off; but in the
afternoon, the Firkin Pub leap is
still happening, so just go along to
your local Firkin pub between
1.00am and 5.00pm, and you'll see
a load of people leapfrogging
around each pub; so go and join in,
or just support them and enjoy the
brilliant atmosphere. As an
incentive, the pub who raises the
most money in the afternoon will be
given a large alcohol prize for those
who have spent the afternoon in the
pub; and if you haven't yet tried the
special Leap Frog beer that the
Firkin pubs have brewed specially
for the occasion, then it's definitely
worth a visit and, needless to say,
all the profits go to Oxfam.
Still reading? Well stop and get
down to Covent Garden before it's
too late!
