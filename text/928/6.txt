The fact that the crowd here looks
like rejects from a physics lecture,
with a few added women for
balance, is neither here nor there.
There were too many men in suits
to be just record company reps, and
there was a bloke in front of me in
ill-fitting, pastel green trousers, I
kid you not. I soon moved away.
Call the fashion police.
Boo Hewerdine, tonight's
support act, promoting his new
album Ignorance, has a nice
acoustic guitar sound, and an
amusing line in inter song banter.
Siobhan Maher, lead singer of
River City People has no such gift
of the gab, but her voice is stunning
when singing, particularly to an
acoustic version of Carry The
Blame in the encore. Her coat is
quite nice too, in a greeny, velvety
sort of way. She's certainly got
something though, as her band seem
to have been multiplying over the
past six months. There were six of
them tonight, and there only used
to be four. Most disturbing.
The band thunder through their
set, drawn from both their albums,
and this is where a minor moan
comes in. The songs from the debut
album stand head and shoulders
above most of the newer stuff, the
only two lights from the second
album being Tfie Sea and Mi7e High
Cafe. The new single, which
they're presumably here to
promote, their second biggest chart
hit ever (Fact!), is the one of the
worse offenders, though not the
lowest of the low, and at least they
managed to restrain themselves
from playing their biggest
(California Dreamin'), much to the
disappointment of one particularly
sad character next to me. Even so,
the songs from the new album
sound better live then they do on the
album, which leads to the possible
conclusion that the album was over
produced. Hmmmm, just a minor
moan though, and once I became
able to ignore the audience, it was
an enjoyable evening.

• Standing In The Need Of Love is
available now in good record shops
everywhere. It is also available at
Our Price.
Rainbow is the latest to rise from
the Candyland stable. The original
track has a style returning to the
more mellow aspects of the boys'
music; a cry from Kingdom and
probably more commerically
appealing. Having said that, the
difference doesn't really span a
millenium (as they say) and bears
an uncanny resemblance to Maker
which could lay a minor curse on
its predicted success.
So, Rainbow doesn't look fit to
give Candyland the commercial
break they may deserve, but is
entertaining (did I say
'entertaining'? or would 'nice' be
better...) in all variety of forms,
especially Chapman's swinging
mixes...
(I think) my name is Pat.
^Rainbow is released on
Fiction/Polydor on March 9.
Candyland play at the Borderline on
March 7.
Candyland: Not looking like Madness in the slightest.
Ocean Colour Scene - Sway
of the Bahamas. This makes it quite
likable, despite the first track on the
second side sounding like
something, well to be honest, that
shouldn't be allowed out of its hole.
Two years ago this would have been
interesting, now its only interest is
in realising how similar everything
was back then. An album out
shortly, they're starting to tour
again, are we going to see Ocean
Colour Scene two? If so they had
better do better than this, likable is
far from lovable.

*Sway is available on Fontana
now. Ocean Colour Scene play the
Marquee, March 13.
This takes me back. The heady days
of 1990, when I was still a teenager,
when you couldn't slag off Robert
Maxwell, before Bryan Adams was
number one. A re-release of a single
I can't really recall and I'm finding
hard to remember even though I
listened to it not an hour ago. The
name is so apt, the mood is
definitely one of extreme
mellowness, this record washes
over you like the crystal blue waters
The Joshua
Trio -
Underworld
style, this was a very amusing
evening. I'm am now thoroughly
cheered up and not that pissed off
with Mega City 4. In case you
haven't guessed, The Joshua Trio
are a U2 pisstake. Where Abba
have Bjorn Again, and Simple
Minds have James, U2 have The
Joshua Trio. And they deserve
them. Pompous rock gits.
Thundering through the essential
U2 discography, tearing all of them
apart, segueing other songs in, such
as DefLeppard's Pour Some Sugar
On Me into God Part 2. Their
highly disrespectful treatment of
Where The Streets..., One,
Mysterious Ways, and the rest is
just the beginning though. They
have readings from The Good Book
- the gospel of Bono, they tear into
Sinead O' Connor with Nothing
Compares 2 U2, and the lead singer
has an unstoppable desire never to
stay on the stage for more than two
minutes. He crawls around the
dancefloor pretending to be a dog,
running round the whole venue on
a hobby horse, climbing up over
barriers, and generally harassing
the, in the main, unsuspecting
audience.
But therein lies their only
problem. The fact that as soon as
they start selling out venues, or
moving up to larger stages, he
won't be able to. It looks like they
will have to make some sacrifices.
Because sooner or later, they are
going to start being massive.
