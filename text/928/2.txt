Letters Felix 928 28 February 1992
C&G Dinner and Dance
Dear Adam,
I am writing to say what a great
evening I had at the C & G Dinner
and Dance at the Waldorf, and to
thank everyone whose hard work
made it a night I will never forget.
As you no doubt know, the guest
of honour was Bob Symes (better
known as the old eccentric, with the
amazing beard and moustache,
from 'Tomorrow's World'). He
struck me as an interesting speaker,
and I hear his after-dinner speech
was highly original and witty.
Unfortunately (here comes the
gripe) we did not hear a word due
to the noise generated by the tables
at the far end of the hall.
Their continual chattering and
drunken cackles were illtimed to say
the least and showed an extreme
lack of courtesy and manners.
Tim Proctor (C&G Pres), having
struggled through the same
embarrassing hub-bub during his
speech, discretely walked round to
ask them to keep it down, but
obviously this was too much to
expect from these people.
Now I understand that everyone
had had a few drinks, and I agree
that the PA system may not have
been quite adequate for the size of
the room, but everyone could see
Mr Symes was talking. Surely they
could have kept their mouths shut
for a few minutes like the rest of us.
They were downright rude.
Ten out of ten to Mr Symes for
carrying on like a true professional.

further £1,800 by ICU and £1,000
from the Rector, the remainder
being offered by the CCU's.
In fact this money will never be
used as ticket sales covered the
underwritten costs, so the
production cost approximately
£2,000. Hopefully, now we have
tested the ground next year's show
(the Great Hall has already been
booked) will be cheaper to stage.
Perhaps there is a sublime policy
of 'something for everyone' at work
in the innermost depths of the Felix
production staff. Because after all
the above rant there is a section of
Felix that I regularly enjoy, that is
the travel documentaries often
featured, these are always
interesting and amusing,
congratulations.
Yours faithfully,
Darren Holmes, Chem 2.
AIDS
Awareness
Week
Dear Adam,
AIDS Awareness Week
24th-28th February 1992
On behalf of the organisers of the
Aids Awareness week we would
like to thank you for the space
which was given to this initiative in
the last edition. However we were
somewhat concerned and perplexed
by the photographs used in support
of the articles particularly the one
which appeared beneath the heading
'The Terrence Higgins Trust'. Not
only was this picture wholly
inappropriate considering the
subject matter, it also sought to
trivialise the work of this
organisation and our attempts at
increasing people's understanding
of a serious issue.
The Aids Awareness Week is one
of a number of health and welfare
initiatives which the College and the
Student Union will be running. We
hope that any future articles will
have constructive and relevant
supporting illustrations, if any are
considered necessary.
Yours sincerely,
Ola Oluiode,
Employee Relations Office on
behalf of IC Union Welfare
Committee and the Personnel and
Administrative Services Division.
Felix La
Dear Adam,
This is to let you know that I was
responsible for the removal and
reallocation of the copies of Felix
assigned to the Old Chemistry
Building. This action was
unjustified and uncalled for.
However...
I find it difficult to have much
respect for any publication that will
print, in the fashion of the tabloid
or gutter press, an article which
contains so much that is not even
misinformed fact, but sheer fiction.
I refer of course to Steve
Newhouse's 'Grease Review', a
man who by his own admission had
never seen a show on this scale in
rehearsal, or on the stage at this
college! Surely then not the most
qualified writer to report on a show
that for a few weeks united Opsoc,
rceny
Dramsoc, Imperial College Union,
City & Guilds Union, Royal School
of Mines Union, Royal College of
Science Union, Conference Office,
Sherfield Safety, Security and the
Holland Club amongst others.
Agreed, the first night was rough
around the edges, as may be
expected, but after that I found little
truth in the article in question. The
most notable 'mistake' being the
quote T found myself wondering
where £8,000 of Imperial College
money had gone', I can tell you
now that at no time was £8,000 of
Imperial College Union (ICU)
money likely to go anywhere as
they had only subsidised the show
to £1,000 (including Opsoc and
Dramsoc show budgets), as had the
Rector. The rest of the £8,000 show
budget was underwritten by a
Libellous piece of Journalism
Dear Adam,
Who was responsible for the
libellous piece of journalism
accompanying the U L U football
league tables in FELIX, issue 927?
I took the effort to get the U L U
tables to you, and in return I did not
expect some 'journalist' to write
cynical, incorrect and down-right
bad mannered rubbish about
Imperial's six mens football teams.
I would like to take this
opportunity to put the record
straight.
1. What is being implied by
writing:
TC4th's are in danger of being
promoted to Division 3 (where they
should be in the first place).'?
It is a great achievement to gain
promotion, and certainly a credit to
the college for an Imperial team to
do so. It should not be described as
dangerous! As regards what
division the 4th team should play in,
I have been through the football
club archives, which go back to
1984, and found that IC4th's have
always played in Division 4 making
the possible promotion even more
impressive an achievement. It is, in
fact, the 5th and 6th teams who are
playing in a division 'too high',
which is due to the past effort of
those two teams, earning
themselves promotion within the
last three years.
2. I read that:
TC 2nd's have an outside chance
of winning Division Two'.
In the football club we consider
it a very outside chance, partially
due to the fact that IC 2nd's play
in Division One!
3. It is nonsensical to write:
'...propping up 4th place...'
Teams prop up bottom places in
a division, not top ones. Our 1st and
3rd teams do not deserve this
wording after working especially
hard to achieve places near the top
of their respective divisions this
year.
4. My biggest bone of contention
regards the end comment:
'What more can you expect from
such a pathetic lot?'
Perhaps this was supposed to be
some sort of joke—well it wasn't
very funny.
It isn't just Felix staff who put a
great deal of work into the
successful running of their club, I
think we could all do without these
cheap, negative jibes.
Before the author accuses us, the
footballers, of being pathetic would
he (or she—we also have a very
successful ladies team) like to bring
his/her boots along any Wednesday
or Saturday and find out for
themselves how pathetic Imperial
2 —
football is.
I would like to end by saying that,
if we had wanted 16 lines of
fallacies to accompany the tables,
we would have provided them
ourselves. If, in future, you write
a piece about the football club,
please have the decency to ask me
for the accurate details—I am
available in the Union every
lunchtime for football club
business.
In conclusion, after reading the
article and noting that Felix Francis,
of Imperial, is currently captaining
the University of London football
team, we in the football club are of
the opinion that our Felix is better
than yours!
Yours,
David Buckle, Club Captain,
Imperial College Association
Football Club.
