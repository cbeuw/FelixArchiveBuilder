Opinion Felix 928 28 February 1992
I'll just like a moment of your
time to share something rather
special with you. It's a little about
everything, life, computers, ice-
creams, sex etc. and in particular
you.
Before I go on, I want to
introduce an interesting concept,
called 'Quality'. 'Quality' is
undefinable. We can understand
'Quality' in how it manifests or
shows itself but not why it does so.
It's probably a little vague at the
moment, but if you'll bear with me,
it'll clear up soon enough.
Quality manifests itself in many
forms, one of them crops up in the
arts, when I ask you why you like
that allows them to come together
and form the inanimate.
Inanimate objects have another
Quality that allows them to come
together to form life.
Biological organisms group'
together with another Quality to
form a society.
In order for societies to interact,
another Quality creates the intellect.
The final Quality is one that
allows intellects to be groups
together. Artistic Quality is an
integrating or uniting factor
between the hierarchical levels.
Quality gives rise to everything.

Quality.
something, you'll probably reply
because it looks good, but why? It's
simply because it feels so. What I'm
talking about is artistic Quality. It's
there but you can't define it.
Although there are some principles
that determine what good art is,
they aren't enough to turn us into
Van Goghs or Rembrandts.
Let me show you another
example, we all know that all matter
is held together by electrostatic
forces, i.e. positive and negative
charges. Unlike charges attract and
like repels, but why is this so? We
all know how it works but we don't
know why. Quality again. Break
any concept down far enough and
you'll have Quality staring at you.
Particles have a certain Quality
biological and social levels and
onwards in the evolution are 'Mind
Qualities' whereas the ones below
are 'Matter Qualities'. In our field
of knowledge, quantum physics and
biochemistry are the closest fields
to their corresponding Qualities.
(See diagram 2).
Science asks why certain things
occur, and for a while it can go on
explaining why, but sooner or later
it'll hit Quality and it's stumped.
Even if someone could explain why
unlike charges attract, then his
reasons must be explained too
and...
The realm of Quality is just like
a big black hole that defeats human
comprehension. Defining it would
always make it less than what it is.
Mind and matter are related.
They both have the same common
denominator, Quality. They aren't
separate entities, although our
intellect can function without
knowing how the inanimate is
created or why the inanimate is
created. Each level in the hierarchy
functions like a virtual machine.
Just like a computer programmer
needs only to know how a program
works not how it's created much
less what an npn transistor is, to live
in a society, we only need to know
its rules and laws.
At each level within this
hierarchy, there exists varying
degrees of evolution of that level.
There are high Quality biological
organisms and low Quality ones.
Everything that Quality creates has
itself Quality, sort of like the
Mandelbrot set analogy. Someone
like Leonardo Da Vinci had a pretty
high Quality mind, not just
intelligence Quality but artistic
Quality as well. Similarly, at the
society level, something is
considered right or good if it has
high Quality. The fact that the
problem of society has not yet been
satisfactorily resolved is due to the,
lack of context. You cannot come
to a conclusion of what's acceptable
if you don't know where you stand.
Sort of like a dog chasing its tail.
It goes round and round and round
and finally stops from
dizziness...back to square one.
Since Quality has given rise to these
values, then we can see that the
hierarchy evolution of Quality has
precedence in determining rights
and wrongs.
A doctor, in order to save a
patient has to kill the germs in the
patient. The patient wants to live,
the germ wants to live but the
person is at a higher biological state
of evolution that the germ.
If a person isn't putting others at
risk then society has no right to kill
him because the intellect is at a
higher level of evolution than
society.
In everything, there exists a static
and dynamic factor. Imagine this
person who did everything society
expected, followed all the laws, was
very moral and ethical. This is
essentially a very static person. But
one day, a sudden spark hits him (or
her or whatever) and he didn't like
something about society. So there
he goes creating a huge upheaval.
For a while society's standards just
condemns him, but what if people
began to see his point of view and
also liked what he was making all
the fuss about. So he becomes some
revolutionary leader and changes
society's outlook. It's never as
simple as this but that's the
principle.
