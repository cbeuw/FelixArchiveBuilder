Outdoor
The year for S + G, the Outdoor
Club, started last summer in the
Dauphine Alps of southern France,
where for three weeks fifteen of us
made our home in the high Alpine
valleys of Les Ecrins National Park.
From there we ventured onto the
mountains and, experienced and
inexperienced alike, soon found
ourselves tackling the big summits.
The first success was on climbing
meant breathtaking scenery, dawns
and sunsets, and the magical
tranquillity of the mountains.
The mountain bikers in the group
tended to venture further afield,,
sometimes for several days over the
high mountain passes, but not to be
outdone they also managed an
ascent of the 3000 metre L A
Blanche, in places 'using the bikes
as ice axes'.

Insanity
the 4000+ metre Barre des Ecrins,
the highest peak in the region.
From our bivouac on the Glacier
Blanc five of us set out before dawn
to follow the glacier to the foot of
the main climb while the snowpack
was still firm and crisp. From there
a vertical kilometre of steep snow
slope stretched above us. We had
to make a quick and direct ascent
before the heat of the day allowed
the snow to soften too far, and after
long hours of climbing managed to
reach the summit early on a glorious
afternoon.
Later, successful attempts were
also made on such notable peaks as
Pelvous (climbed by night by
Coolidge Couloir), the spectacular
lone spire of Aiguille Dibona whose
summit could only accommodate
one person, and beautiful Les Bans.
However the difficulty of mountains
was considerable, and on some
occasions this together with the
severe Alpine storms meant
abandoning hopes for the summit.
Nevertheless, climbing always
On dates off from climbing we
visited the local towns and villages
and also found time for a bit of
skiing at the resort of Les Deux
Alpes. These respites were
particularly appreciative by Clive -
'Do you think I'm some sort of
hardship freak or something?'.
During it all, however, it only
occurred to our chairman that all the
snow could be put to a much better
use; a snowball fight! By all
accounts it was an epic Summer
Tour, and even after most of us had
returned to England the
irrepressible Martin, Phil and
Richard continued on to Chamonix
from where they climbed Mont
Blanc.
However, all was not hard work
last summer. The clubs weekends
around this country provided the
perfect antidote to Alpine climbing;
in Dartmoor it was the cream teas
at the end of a days walk and in the
Lake District the same was
provided by the sailing on Lake
Windermere on hot afternoons.
The start of the college year in
October also saw trips to the Peak
District of Derbyshire and the
Brecon Beacons, where between
rock climbing or trying to walk in
50mph winds, the club members
rediscovered their enthusiasm for
going into caves. On the third
weekend trip of the term to the Lake
District we encountered to our,
surprises the first, and only major
snowfall of the winter.
This was used to full advantage
by all those eager to do some snow
and ice (and waterfall) climbing, on
both Bow Fell and Great End, and
by all those who fancied another
good snowball fight. Liz, Colin,
Glen and Stuart - the mad mountain
bikers - also turned a few heads by
working their way over snow and
ice to the top of Skiddaw and
Hellyvelyn, and their determination
was rewarded by allowing them to
virtually ski the decents.
The clubs final trip of last term
was to Snowdonia. Although we
were not as lucky with the snow, the
weather still obliged; starting out in
drizzle, we soon found ourselves in
brilliant sunshine as we gained
height on the mountains, above a
sea of clouds with only the tops of
the highest mountains being visible.
It was one of the most stunning
views any of us had ever seen.
After the end of term Christmas
festivities, the club set off on its
week long winter tour to Glen Etive
in Scotland. Those who are familiar
with the Highlands in winter will
know that it is only for the hardiest,
and this year we were washed out
by torrents of rain and the floods
they brought. Nevertheless,
climbers and bikers still braved the
elements and the hangovers to enjoy
days on such impressive mountains
as Buchaille Etive Mor. Honours go
to those who climbed Ben Nevis in
atrocious conditions; Oli and Rupert
via a snow climb, and Colin on his
icicle beset mountain bike.
The club is now half way through
this terms activities, and we've
already had two more trips to the
Lake District and one more to
Snowdonia. These saw the
reemergence of bivouacking, for
those eager, but sleeping suspended
by a harness hundreds of metres up
a rock face is not everyones idea of
a good time. Most opted instead for
the traditional retiring to the warmth
of the local pub in the evenings.
Amongst other things planned for
the rest of this term is a barging
weekend on some of the Midlands
canals, and the clubs week long
Easter Tour to the Isle of Skye.
During the summer term we'll also
have another weekend in the Peak
District and one to Cornwall after
the exams, agreed to be probably
the best of the year.
