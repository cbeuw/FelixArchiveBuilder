DEPUTY PRESIDENT Phil Sharp proposed by John St-Hill
I'm Phil a mathematics 3rd Year.
I'm standing for DP. Basically
DP is involved with all the money
side of the Union. He looks after the
Bar, Bookshop & Catering and
chairs the Union Finance
Committee which decides, amongst
other things, how much money
clubs are allocated.
I won't give you all the lies about
what a wonderful hedonistic Utopia
the Union will be if you vote for
me. I just promise to do my best
John St-Hill (Maths 3rd Year
ex RCS Vice-President) on Phil
Sharp
I have known Phil for 3 years as
a friend and member of ICRAG.
Through out that time he has always
been a mature and responsible if
somewhat strange individual.
Security & Discipline :-Phil has
often shown himself to be a
responsible individual with good
organisational ability. This,
together with his understanding and
approachable nature will bring a
human side to ICU discipline.
Mascotry :-Phil has played an
active part in RCS mascotry over
the last three years.
Finance & Management :-Phil is
often involved in financial side of
Rag and assisted Laurie and myself
on numerous occasions counting
and banking money.
Phil has always been a trusted and
supportive friend. I believe that his
skills and natural ability together
with his easy-going sense of
humour would make him an
excellent candidate for Deputy
President and I urge you to vote for
him.
HON SEC (EVENTS) Nick Allen proposed by Laurie McNamee
During my time at Imperial I have
thrown myself into college life. I
am an ex-Royal College of Science
Union Honorary Junior Treasurer
and edited Broadsheet, the RCS
newspaper, in my first year as well
as the RCS handbook. I have also
been heavily involved in IC Rag,
being one of only four members of
the £1000 club last year. I am
principal cellist with Imperial
College Symphony Orchestra, and
am at present organising their
forthcoming tour to Hungary.
The job of Hon Sec is a disparate
one. It includes responsibility for
Rag, Entertainments, room
bookings, as well as
Commemoration Ball, Freshers
Fair and the sabbatical work split.
I am not going to sit here making
rash election promises. I will do the
job to the best of my ability as
defined by the constitution to ensure
a smooth ride for all IC and Mary's
students. However, my ideas for the
inclusion of innovation into the
Union include:
-Trying to get a better Ents
licence to encourage bigger names
to IC, and promote more up and
coming acts.
-With the forthcoming
refurbishment of the concert hall,
showing films twice a week with the
co-operation of Film Soc and ICSF.
-Promoting bar and snack bar
facilities over the Summer vacation.
This will have obvious benefits for
students and postgrads present over
the summer.
-Increased use of the union as a
hireable venue.
-Investigating the possibility of
computerising room booking,
streamlining the service for clubs
and societies.
-Investigating the possibility of
employing a full time ents officer.
This is not a slur on Ents, but an
attempt to increase the already very
professional nature in which ICU is
run.
I feel my experience makes me
well suited to the post of Hon Sec.
Vote for me.
