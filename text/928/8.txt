Claytown
Troupe
-Wanted It All
The recent migrants from Island to
EMI America ( What Time Is
Love? ), Claytown Troupe, want to
be The Cult. That's O K though,
because The Cult want to be Guns
'n' Roses. Someone has to, I guess.
Assuming that there's nothing
wrong with being The Cult, because
there isn't, especially around the
The Fall
- Free Range
particular era that Claytown Troupe
want to emulate - that of 'Sanctuary'
and the like, is the best phase
they've been through so far, and
considering their current direction,
the one they're most likely to.
It has been pointed out to me, just
now, that, if you take the letters
C,U,L and T out of Claytown
Troupe, you can make the phrase
Yawn Report (if you change an O
to an R, that is.)
There's nothing much else I can
say. If you like The Cult, you'll like
this. I liked this.

them.
But hang on one moment there.
Let's remember that even though
they may have nothing to say,
neither have most of the rest of the
bands. And with their recruited
bassist Kramer from Bongwater
(don't say 'who', you ignorance
bastards), the sound and atmosphere
due to it are great, even if some of
the moshers are a little malicious
and the set is splattered with
amusing incidents. The stagediver
pushed off the stage by Kramer,
who landed on the floor and was
then pulled back on stage by him;
Kramer's attempt to give away his
microphone stand, and a near riot
at the end when all the band joined
the stagedivers in the crowd. A
most enjoyable, if slightly
transatlantic evening.

Britain. Their albums are available
on import through Shimmy Disc.
This week starts well, and
then...There's a distinctly Irish feel
this week: tonight The Sultans of
Ping FC, from Cork, at the
Borderline, but if rumours from
upstairs are to be believed, they're
playing here next week; 1000 Yard
Stare—a nice young five piece from
Slough; and Frank and Walters: the
men in orange, from, err, Cork.
The Frank & Walters may or may
not be playing inside the student
bedsit that is the Camden Falcon on
Saturday, but their competition is
stiff. Nutmeg and Trash, who were
reviewed in issue 924. See Dramsoc
if you want to read that review, and
they'll decide whether you can go,
and Scorpio Rising in Windsor.
It sort of trails off after that, with
only the Forget-me-Nots on
Monday to brighten things up.
(They're Irish too, actually.)
That's it.
