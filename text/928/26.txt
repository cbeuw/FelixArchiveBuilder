Felix Felix 928 28 February 1992
So, what's this about elections
running a week early? It seems last
year's Sabbs messed up with E G M
timing and what with changes to the
byelaws and the constitution, the
whole thing's a joke.
At least we've got two good
candidates for Felix Editor, Toby
Jones and Jonty Beavan. That's
more than I can say for the other
Sabb posts. How am I going to
make an informed choice, with four
people standing for Hon. Sec.
(Events). Nick Allen, Aled Fenner,
Stef Smith and Sarah Harland.
Surely they're not all serious! 'What
better reason for voting New
Election', was the theme of last
Dear Marge,
People have always thought me
odd - the antisocial hours and ritual
sacrifices - but now my flatmate has
developed an unhealthy obsession
with all things black and sinister.
He never wears his Daffy Duck T-
shirt any more but insists on
year's campaign - I don't think
anything's changed.
Phil Sharp's the only one standing
for Deputy President - should he get
in because he's unopposed? And
Angelo Gardini (Christopher
Davidson and Anthony Baldwin are
also standing for President) hasn't
even been seconded yet.
That wonderful news reporter,
Declan Curry, has been seen trying
to coordinate iCNN by running
around annoying anyone. Talking
in a fake accent all the time - people
might think he really does sound
like John Cole, live from
Westminster.

do,

Dear Desperate
All that is black and sinister is not
necessarily evil - but, as I know
your flatmate, I would worry.
Yours Marge.
Dear Marge,
I wish to complain about the
patent lies you wrote about me in
last week's Felix.
I was not in fact present at the
recent bash in Fisher Hall held oh
behalf of the Lexham Gardens Flat
Ten Batchelors Black and White
party.
Having not been invited, I
considered it bad form to turn up
uninvited. I therefore returned to 90
Lexham (for which I qualify as
resident on a crash basis) after 6
pints of Double Dragon, drank half
a bottle of Marsala, and passed out
on the floor. I was only awoken by
Massie taking his trainers off upon
his return.
If you continue to publish these
patent untruths, I will reveal the full
story of your pubic hair being used
as a paperweight.
Yours threateningly,
Martin Heigh way.
Msc. D.I.C (Just)
Dear Martin
What's all this about
paperweights? It never managed to
get that far did it!
Yours Marge.

Dear Marge,
I have been thinking about
running for a sabbatical post but I
am anxious that my sordid past will
affect my standing. I spend much
of my time being groped by three

Dear Perturbed,
I shouldn't mention the shower

Dear Marge,
I have a problem. I am a bitter,

Dear Dave,
You are not a keen, fresh young
