back to our primeval ancestors is
this static factor. The thing that
causes it to change is the dynamic
factor. The dynamic factor is just
something that arises, weld by
Quality. We all can sense this
Quality, when someone does
something, whether it's high or low
Quality even if it may contradict
society's laws. If we support it, then
we can enforce change. Good and
bad are relative until something
better comes along. Although they
may be arbitrary values, Quality
does keep a sharp eye on it. To say
that killing and murdering should be
decreed legal by a society is pretty
much nonsense because it goes
against the evolution of Quality. To
hold a society together, the
inhabitants won't be allowed to
destroy themselves voluntarily.
A dynamic advance is pretty
pointless unless it can find some
static pattern with which to protect
itself from degeneration back to the
conditions that existed before the
advance was made. Evolution isn't
a continuous forward motion, it
progresses in ratchet like steps.
Some dynamic patterns simply
aren't good enough to form latches.
D N A is essentially static
information but the shift in cell
reproduction from mitosis to
meiosis to permit sexual choice
allows huge D N A diversification,
a dynamic advance.
If someone were to come up with
a proposition that may be nothing
exists, may be everything is in the
mind and you can't deny it because
no one knows the absolute truth;
just what would you say'.'....Well,
in Quality's context, Quality has its
own view and this person has his
own view. Both views are presented
to the public. It would be a pretty
good bet that Quality's view would
score higher on the chart than
'everything's in the mind'. We're
not talking about right and wrong
here, Quality simply decides which
is better, we all decide which is
better, and it'll be something we
accept until a better Quality
approach comes up.
Now, if you'll take a moment to
reflect: just what am I? I am not just
the intellect, not just society
instincts. What do you think
emotions are? Love, sexual desire.

hate. They are biological Qualities
that affect the mind. Sex is a very
high biological Quality, make no
doubt about that. Hate is a pretty
low one. Killing is wrong...society
instinct. All these Qualities make
us. All our experiences shaped us.
We are really a manifestation of our
environment. What arises conflicts
is the clash between values of the
hierarchical levels, when the mind
is divided against itself. Society
doesn't approve of sex much. It's
tolerated but it scores pretty low on
its Quality chart. It's become a lot
more liberal on the subject now but
in some cultures it's still a big no
no. However, as long as we can see
the context, then we should be able
to deal with it. If society can't
tolerate it but biologically it's pretty
good then it should be kept at a
personal level. What's more to say?
Maybe one day casual sex would be
acceptable morally in society but

biological organisms sometimes
tend to be quite possessive of their
partners.
We're all looking for something
in life and the answers are to be
found in ourselves. Quality's
outlook is a whole new perspective
to everything, it unites science and
the arts, mind and matter, subject
and object, life and the universe.
There's just one last example that
you should think about. Imagine
this person who tried to do
everything right. What if life
suddenly took a plunge, and
everything just became worse and
worse. To lose everything and find
out there's still something else to
lose.
Life is one big downpour. I don't
think this person could help but
think 'Why has God forsaken me?
I've been good, why are all these
things happening?'. You see our
concept of absolute good and evil,
even how right it seems doesn't
always fit into reality. For a lot of
people, when reality shatters all
their beliefs, they are drawn very
close to insanity and atheism. Now,
say if this person still had faith in
God but also had the Quality
outlook. Even how bad everything
gets, it's just life, it's just one of
those miserable things. Mentally,
this person would be stable but
depressed. I think this individual's
faith in God would strengthen under

these conditions. At this point I
think if people could see the
courage, the environment can turn
around to help. Whatever it is, the
later approach is better than ending
up with a mental breakdown. This
hypothetical person isn't so
imaginary at all. There's always a
bit of him or her in all of us. life
just isn't always a sweet double
fudge chocolate sundae. Quality
isn't a belief, it's a way of seeing.
The question of what initially
gave rise to Quality and where it's
Matter
Mind
heading relates to our concept of
God and the absolute truth. The fact
that we can't define Quality makes
it pretty meaningless trying to say
what God or the absolute truth is.
The Quality that can be defined is
not the Quality. The God that can
be defined is not the God. The
absolute truth that can be defined is
not the absolute truth. If something
did create Quality and if it is
heading some direction then follow
Quality, that's the best thing we've
got...it created us, no doubt about
that, it created the universe, it keeps
us alive and in turn we can give rise
to Quality.
We're all but a grain of sand on
an endless beach, each unique and
special, taking and endless time to
describe. I was never born and will
never die. When the time comes to
depart, I am like a snowflake
dissolving in air...
'Nobody would deny that
phenomena determines the
theoretical system despite the fact
that there is no theoretical bridge
between phenomena and their
principles.. .There is no logical path
to these principles, only intuition,
resting on sympathetic-
understanding of experience, can
we reach them...'
