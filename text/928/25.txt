28 February 1992 Felix 928 Feature
Bath Rag Raid
Last Saturday, fifteen students from
Imperial College went collecting on
the streets of Bath and raised £1,145
for UNICEF. The event was the
first to be organised by the new Rag
Raid Coordinator, Stuart Rison.
The event almost didn't happen
when the collection permits were
left behind at Imperial at the start
of the day. However swift
coordination between Mr Rison and
Penguin, the Rag Chair who had
stayed behind to work for the day,
meant that the licences were faxed
through to the Bath University
library where they were collected
by Mr Rison and his team.
It is alleged that high jinks
occurred at Bath before the party
returned, with the IC minibus being
covered in bugs and having it's
numberplate removed. It does
however seem that all was not one
sided, but at present details have not
been released.
Penguin stated 'It was an
excellent day. All that took part
enjoyed themselves, a vast amount
was raised and Stuart really excelled
himself in his new post. I'm
pleased.'
Mr Rison said that the next raid
will be near the start of next term,
though the destination is still to be
decided. Everyone is welcome, and
anyone interested should visit the
Rag office during any lunchtime
during the week (excl. Tues) and
put their name down as being
interested. Mr Rison also extended
his thanks to Steve Newhouse for
not only driving, but also collecting
£77 on the day.
On Wednesday 4th March, Rag will
be doing 'what it does best', with
a City of London licence which
includes mainline stations, the
London Underground and the
Lloyds building. This is a great
chance for some profitable
collecting.

So come along to Friday's Rag
meeting in the Union Lounge for
details.
Be mad, be silly, be part of it.
