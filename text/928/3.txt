28 February 1992 Felix 928 Editorial
editorial
Many thanks to all those members
of College staff who responded to
the survey on pages 12 and 13.
Even so, I fail to understand why
a number of them submitted their
responses at 3.00pm on Tuesday,
way after the 12.30pm Monday
deadline. This meant that I had to
repaste the entire page and I didn't
finish until 2.00am the following
morning. I gave the survey two
pages because I allocate pages on
Monday afternoon. This would
have looked reasonable with the
number of responses I had at the
time - but now it looks extremely
cramped. Do they not know the
meaning of the word 'deadline?'
Lack of sleep gets me very ratty
indeed - anyway, thanks for
responding, even if it was late.
In response to Val Straw's query
concerning Union ties - the
acquisition of ICU Colours allows
you to buy the tie, it is not provided.
I wonder why the Union considers
it an honour to allow those
honoured to buy a tie.
Aids Awareness
In response to Ola Olulode's letter
opposite -1 do not think the picture
was wholly inappropriate, after all
the Terrence Higgins Trust's modus
operandi is to never avoid
unsavoury images, to avoid coyness
and euphemisms, and by so doing
to encourage all types of people to
ask for help. Many people enjoy
fantastical sado-masochism - merely
because some people find the idea
unsavoury is no reason to pretend
it doesn't exist. Equally, I would
like to point out that seven pages
worth of AIDS stuff appeared in the
Felix Office over Monday, with no
accompanying pictures except two
line drawings and a Terrence
Higgins Trust leaflet. I did expect
some AIDS information that week,
but was not given any indication as
to how much. I had to find some
semi-relevant pictures myself, no
pictures at all would have resulted
in a completely unreadable layout.
If you can't help, then put up with
my decision.
All things said, the letter was
better reasoned than most criticisms
I have received recently, and more
effective because it was concise and
to the point. The long waffly rants
that have been filling up the letters
page recently are becoming very
tedious.
Larceny Letter
I hope that the other DramSoc or
OpSoc people responsible for the
Felix theft of four weeks ago can
gather enough courage together to
do the same as Darren Holmes has
this week. Own up for your actions
- there will be no victimisation. M r
Holmes brings up an interesting
point - that he has no respect for
publications that print sheer fiction.
Does this include letters? Steve
Newhouse did not write that
review, and if he had he would be
eminently qualified to report on
'Grease' as he had sacrificed a
weekend afternoon to see the
rehearsal, which was so awful it
was decided that it would be unfair
to base a review on it. The first
night was the latest performance
from which a review could be
written to be published that week.
Mr Holmes says that the first night
'was a little rough around the
edges.... but after that I found little
truth in the article in question.'
Does he expect reviewers to be
clairvoyant? You cannot base a
review on a performance you
haven't seen. Apart from that, I
thank him for the letter, and I hope
his collegues follow suit, though not
necessarily at such length.
Libellous Journalism
Does it never end? My response to
David Buckle's letter is simply to
say a serious sense of humour
failure seems to have occured here.
Why be so sensitive? For God's
sake there are more important
things in tne world than
complaining about piffling little
comments which aren't going to
affect anything anyway. We seem
to be on the old chestnut of telling
a newspaper that it can't print
something. Also - look at how many
articles there are in this issue of
Felix - does anyone honestly expect
everyone concerned to be contacted
over each article before printing? If
you do, why don't you do it. You
only get the Felix that students put
work into - you only get the Union
you deserve.

Union Rant
Dear Adam,
Election time again? I was going to
write what I thought of the
candidates, but apparently I'm not
allowed to do that. Censorship from
ICU Tower again. Apparently it
would influence the elections!! It's
supposed to. It's supposed to
prevent the same situation as this
year, where we get incompetence,
self-interest and sod-all concern for
the students.
But the Union permanent staff are
no better (no, not you Rose and
Andy, before I get cut brutally). I'm
talking about the receptionists, who
have seats so they can look down
their noses at the students, and still
keep them stuck up; the catering
staff, who manage to provide stingy
portions, overpriced chocolate,
occasionally(l), when the machine
actually works and still make a loss,
leading to subsidy from higher
drinks prices—another attack on
students' already depleted pockets,
and bookstore staff, with their petty
rulings (no Switch transactions
below £ 3 , even though Switch
payments cost them not a single
penny!).
So what do I suggest? You will
have two options.
1. Listen to the rhetoric, and see
which pathetic specimen is least
unconvincing in their pledges to
work for the students, or
2. New election: kick out the
JAMMS.
Love and Hugs,
Poddy
Poddy has asked me to inform the
world that I would not allow this
letter on the music pages. Might
I add also that all letters on the
letters page are the opinion of
individuals and I have little right
to censor them - Adam.
Philosophy Answer
Dear Adam,
Colourful Philosophy: some
questions.
In Felix 926, Alva Gosson
presented 'a possible colour
scheme'. I would like to make some
comments. The comments are
presented in a fairly arbitrary order.
Summed up, they may be trying to
say that Gosson's colour scheme is
too idealistic.
1. 'A region of that universe is
thus in duplicate'. Why? If a region
of O-space is independent of all
perception than Reality (i.e. O's
perception of O-space) will not be
the same. These should not,
therefore, be any duplication of O-
space. (In fact, given in O's, there
are likely to be in Realities.)
2. 'Everything O knows about
that universe comes from his
perceptions'. This is an incredibly
strong statement, refuting all/any
existence of a priori knowledge. But
is this so, then anything that O
thinks, find, believes, or is troubled
about has no absolute basis. For
instance, 'O finds that observers
have a brain in which...': how can
O be confident of this statement
when the sole basis of its truth value
is O's sense-date?
3. 'O thinks about 'O-space'. By
definition O cannot do this! O can
think only of reality (i.e. his
perception of O-space).
4. 'O finds that everything neatly
fits into units with no leftovers, each
with a name.' Gosson's notion of
O-space seems far too idealistic!
Does this mean that everything is
complete, that all problems have
solutions?
5. The idea of O-space as a huge
tree of connections is an interesting
one. There is, however, no need to
hold it 'lifeless' and hope that it has
'more diversity an colour'. It may
be that O-space evolves through
many dimensions. Suppose, for
instance, that the units (which
connect to form the tree) were
inependently active (i.e., they could
perform actions which had
consequences). It's now easy to
imagine O-space evolving through,
for instance, the time dimension.
The branches of the tree can be
perceived to grow, die, interleave:
O-space continuously restructuring.
6. '...cells simplify messages...'.
Why? Can observers' brains not
assimilate complex structures?
7. Gosson's world is about
mechanics. But there are deeper,
more fundamental questions. Why,
for instance, does O-space exist at
all? Why does O exist? How does
O know that he exists?
