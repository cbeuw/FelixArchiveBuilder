We’re live and in your face
Four live reviews for your ocular consumption should make you all happy bunnies
Love and Squalor was a cracking
debut album. We Are Scientists
managed to balance catchy songs
and high production value with wit
and charm. As with most Ameri-
can bands in the same vein there
always appears to be an underly-
ing driving force coming from the
label, polishing their sound into a
very Radio 1 friendly hook. This
was very noticeable at their gig at
Brixton Academy, the first in a two
night mini-residency.
Crikey, the gig had so many good
aspects, so lets start with the best.
The lighting; yep that was pretty
good. They had this nice ambient
sodium yellow lighting coming in at
waist level in between songs which
basked them in a vintage aura.
Then they had these nets of LEDs
which acted a bit like screens. By
the sides of those they had these
towers of lights, akin to something
Massive Attack play in front of. All-
in-all it was clear there had been a
lot of money spent on making each
song have it’s own little lighting dis-
play, something to identify it by, like
a generic pop song.
What else was there? Oh yes, the
witty jokes between songs, they
were great! About as funny as my
left big toe, well it is between that
and a hot meal – these guys were
really on fire. Oh, and how could I
forget, the bassist was also mous-
tachioed. Apparently now popular,
it obviously gets the kids to buy
the records! So what do we have
then? Great lights, check! Jokes
between songs, with a huge dol-
lop of arrogance? Definitely there!
Fashion trend regalia, including a
‘retro’ moustache? Oh yes, I double
checked that one!
But hold on one cotton picking
moment, this is starting to sound
very much like a big pop act, not
some guitar wielding music kids
who had a startlingly good debut
album! So what was the perform-
ance like? Well it was like a big pop
act, dry, lifeless, tired, dull. The
only thing which was electric was
most certainly their guitars. I was
so utterly disappointed – if it wasn’t
for the really rather good lighting
I would have gone home early and
that wasn't to beat the queues for a
T-shirt.
Admittedly the band did warm up
Get intimate with a band of villains
This is my first gig review for Fe-
lix, an exciting prospect I believe,
particularly as I was going to re-
view The Automatic at the fabulous
Astoria. But, a last minute change
meant I was now going to the curry
house known as Brick Lane to go
see Vincent Vincent and the Villains
at the venue called 93 Feet East. Af-
ter being told these details, I was
then informed that Vincent Vincent
is possibly the next big thing and
that the Venue is really great – nice
and small.
So off I head to Whitechapel. After
many different contradicting direc-
tions from a whole gaggle of people
I finally found my way to Truman’s
Brewery, which unfortunately is a
whole lot bigger than just one build-
ing. So I spent 15 minutes walking
around the vast lots until finally be-
ing directed to where I wanted to
go.
I walk in and my first thought is:
interesting. There's a BBQ out back
and a lounge bar with a picnic ta-
ble courtyard. I was a bit confused
so I asked some other bystanders
who just so happened to be report-
ers from the University of Suffolk’s
paper, who were 3 hours late for an
interview with the band.
It was then time for the gig to
start and a friendly bouncer told us
we were on the wrong side of the
building after waiting 30 minutes
in the courtyard. Inside, the venue
is very intimate, with a capacity of
only between one and two hundred
with couches lining the sides and
no barriers to the stage.
The first performance was a very
lovely girl called Hafdis Huld with
sweet, simple melodic beats – per-
fect for playing while attempting
to court your date – touring for her

So, music, well, erm,
yeah I don’t know. I’m
sure some of it is good and some
of it is rubbish.
Apologies for a few errors in
Femm last week, I hope you were
clever enough to realise the little
hiccups. Thanks for everyone’s
positive words about Femm. I am
responsible for it so if there is a
problem with it then Andy Sykes
can just pass the buck to me. So if
you have complaints then e-mail
music.felix@imperial.ac.uk and
I’ll take your abuse like some sort
of masochistic dart-board.
One thing that I have been
asking various people lately and
have been interested in is the ef-
fect that downloading music has
on the aesthetic of music. By this
I mean the sleeve artwork and
music being a cohesive vision
as a product. This has led to an
increase in people purchasing
vinyl. Music has become slightly
more disposable because it has
become more readily available.
So more people seem to be re-
acting to that and buying into an
aesthetic.
I do love the joy of getting a new
album and popping the CD in the
player and flicking through the
album liner. It makes everything
feel like a genuine artistic product
and not something for consump-
tion. Vinyl does just look nice and
I agree that it sounds better pro-
viding you have a good amp.
However, music is not all about
the medium and the ‘product’, it
is also partly about being able to
‘sell’ yourself through your per-
formance. On the stage is where
a band tightens up the screws by
hammering away at the same
songs every night. A record can
last for life but a gig is a one-off.
An album works outside of time,
whereas a show is about the mo-
ment. This is why live perform-
ances will always be important;
bands are exposed for what they
are, they become the human form
of all those well-produced pits on
your CD.
So here we have two pages of
live reviews for delectation. Go
out, and love live music. There
is a Jazz and Rock night tonight
(Friday 17th) where you can do
this. It is free to get in before
9pm, £3 after. Why don’t you go
and support live music at your
uni for free!
live reviews
We Are Scientists
Brixton Academy
by the end of the set, finishing on
their hit, The Great Escape, it was
a bit rousing, but then they did have
some guy from the Editors do a
guest appearance and play the gui-
tar – the only man on the stage who
could that night. The highlight of
the evening was them opening with
some Celine Dion song, very eight-
ies, but sadly the rest just wasn’t
that much cop.

Vincent Vincent and the Villains
93 Feet East
new album, Dirty Paper Cups. Af-
ter interviewing her I still believed
she had the most talent out of the
three performances that night and
I discovered she was the Icelandic
former Gus Gus singer and has
also toured with FC Kahuna.
The second set was a four-piece
called The Metros. Who, though
lacking in talent greatly made up
for it with their confidence. They
were basically four Londoner kids
getting kicks from drinking beer
and attacking their screaming
instruments.
The headling act were then on
and, though, not to my particular
liking, what with them going with
the new fad of keeping there indis-
tinguishable accents and strum-
ming the guitar high up on their
chests not unlike the Kooks, were
never the less quite catchy. The
drummer deserves all dues, with
him having a hernia operation the
next day and still ripping up the
skins. The act carried on and the
riffs got louder. After multiple spon-
taneous on-stage dancing bouts
by the audience and an exciting
encore, the show was over and the
crowd quickly dispersed.
Overall I believe that with a band
that you like, playing at 93 Feet
East; it could be one of the best per-
formances you've ever seen.
