Our first enounter with St Barts
had a stressful lead up to the match
as both pitch venue and push back
time were changed with less than
24 hours notice. We were also with-
out a goalie until RSM kindly lent us
Sammy at the last minute. Thank-
fully, not only did we have a goal-
keeper but also 3 substitutes, some-
what unheard of for ladies hockey.
IC got off to a great start with
Amanda scoring within the first
couple of minutes, closely followed
by her lovely little sister, Melissa,
adding another- all within the first
five minutes!
Encouragement from the side-
lines spurred us on and the opposi-
tion were beginning to tire visibly.
There were fantastic runs up the
wings from Jenny on the right and
Trish and Laura on the left.The ball
rarely left the St Barts half, leaving
Sammy a little bored in goal. IC’s
8th goal went in and luckily, for St
Barts, the half time whistle followed
and oranges were consumed.
At this point Fi introduced anoth-
er incentive (as if winning was not
enough). If 17 or more goals were
scored, beating last seasons record
(a 16-0 win by the mens 4s), she
would buy an a round for the entire
team. Knowing certain alcoholics
amongst them, it would include the
most expensive drinks available,
leaving our poor captain penniless
for the rest of term. With the stakes
raised IC went out with even more
vigour than usual and started the
pressure again. Mala was fantastic
as centre half and Shirley, on the
left wing, created even more chanc-
es for goal scoring opportunities.
The defence were working just
as hard pushing up and intercept-
ing any stray balls. They were on
good form with Izzy, Bella and Han
getting stuck in. Sheena and her
housemate, Alice (two Alices, both
ginger; very confusing) worked well
as a doulble act!
The quality of the hockey de-
graded slightly as Barts continued
to give away short corners, the last
play of the match was another IC
goal from a short corner.
The final goal count was as fol-
lows; Amanda 5 (more than she
scored all of last season), Mala 3
(not bad for her first match for IC),
Melissa 2 (obviously learning from
her big sis) Jenny 1 (another fan-
tastic IC debut) Shirley 1 (hopefully
the first of many) and Fi 1 (undoubt-
edly the only one of the season!).
To top of a great match, teas were
provided and Laura stepped up as
a very strict fines master; Alice was
working too hard, before heading
back for the usual shenanigans at
the union!
Only a couple of weeks after crush-
ing the 3rd team the IC ladies were
once again optimistic about their
chances against St Barts 2nds.
Despite the wintry weather, we
burst onto the pitch full of energy
and eager to get ourselves some
goal pie! It was clear from the start
that making an appearance at train-
ing does help, as we saw a dramatic
improvement in our ball control
and hockey skills.
This meant that IC dominated the
game from the early stages, playing
a very solid, attacking game with
great support from Izzy, Shirley
and Bella pushing up from defence
all the time.
Marla, taking the critical central
role provided an awesome link be-
tween defence and the forwards
the ball almost always reached the
stick of a striker. Dasha, Melissa
and Amanda worked hard upfront,
especially in the ‘D’, shooting at
every opportunity.
Short corners were hardly scarce
and yet IC found themselves in a
goal-less situation. As half time ap-
proached, frustration set in and it
was time for another inspiring team
talk from Fi.
The second half started much in
the same way as it did in the first,
with St Barts surviving on their

scrappy but effective defence.
However, IC persevered and were
awarded another short corner.
Amanda received the ball and sent
a high speed cross to Marla, by the
goal post, amidst the mess of de-
fenders she was able to get a stick
to it and deliver it across the goal
line.
The second goal followed shortly,
this time originating from a long
corner. Bella planted a strong final
touch to give IC a healthy lead.
The result barely reflected the
dominance of IC’s game, but a third
win in a row was, without doubt,
cause for celebration! Let’s hope
there will be many more to come!
These young ladies are definitely hockey players. I’m sure this time; the sticks are a dead giveaway. I won’t make that mistake again, honest
