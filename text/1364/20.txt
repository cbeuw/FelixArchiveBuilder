than Bob himself whilst adding a
hilariously camp twist to the Live 8
organiser’s personality.
“That’s a wrap”, announced Paul
over the walkie-talkies. The day
had been a success. Nobody broke
an ankle tripping over cabling and
we hadn’t overrun, which Patrick
informed me was very common.
Twenty-hour days not unheard of
on shoots that he had worked on. I
stepped onto the tube train and sat
down; until this point I had been
fresh as a daisy. Fatigue struck eve-
ry muscle in my body, my brain dis-
engaged, and the unwinding proc-
ess began. I was unaware at the
time, but I had been so focused to
help out and make a good impres-
sion I hadn’t given much thought to
anything else. Each night I would
stumble into bed for much valued
rest and recovery time.
As the rest of the week passed,
plenty of challenges would have to
be dealt with, including a nearby
resident who began exclaiming:
“I’m furious” because “those two
bloody cars have been taking up
three spaces all day!” (In order to
let out the Winnebago). Another
incident concerned an extra who
was sacked for dawdling on set
was calmly dealt with by Mary, the
production manager, before she
confessed: “I thought he was go-
ing to hit me or something.” And
of course there was the aforemen-
tioned search for Brian Conley’s
clay false teeth.
However, this was another of the
industry’s greatest rewards – each
day was a new adventure. It’s not
often you get to see the Queen
drawing on a cigarette, Clark Kent
bursting out of his black suit or Bob
Geldof doing doughnuts on a moped
with Mother Theresa riding pillion.
So, how was Sir Bob, I can hear
the gossip inside you ask. Well, he
requested Earl Grey tea, refused to
talk the press on one occasion, and
even went as far as asking me to
retrieve his mobile phone for him!
Is that enough to sate your celeb-
rity-thirsty appetite? Seriously, I
truly believe he was very good hu-
moured, even improving the script
by adding to the already extensive
list of reasons why he was submit-
ted to rehab.
W
hen I told peo-
ple that I stud-
ied physics, the
news was often
greeted with a
look of surprise. I enjoy my degree,
but I would like to follow a more dy-
namic career. One that doesn’t en-
tail me bean-counting or staring at
spreadsheets.
The difficulties of finding your
way into film or television industry
are well documented. Because of
this I was hesitant to pull my finger
out and gain some experience. For
any budding filmmakers reading,
my main piece of advice would be to
ensure your manner is as friendly
as possible when contacting compa-
nies, whilst maintaining your sense
of professionalism. This is not the
financial sector, so relax, be honest,
make sure you are motivated, and
remove that wretched tie.
Now that I’ve opened the first
few cinematic gateways, I feel far
more confidant that I can return to
the industry. Getting over the first
hurdle certainly requires patience.
Prepare to be ignored!
The cast and crew were friendly
folk, the experience was fantastic,
and the catering fully filled my vac-
uous stomach. I Am Bob is current-
ly undergoing the post-production
process. Expect to see Bob Geldof
fending off an army of look-alikes in
a few months time on a television
screen near you.
