Companies are always looking for
ways to improve profitability and
make more money. To do this, a
company may try merging with an-
other or buying and acquiring an-
other company. This can improve
the business’s economies of scale,
improve synergy and can increase
market share. It is this last point
which regulators are interested in.
In the UK, a merger cannot go
ahead if it will “result in a substan-
tial lessening of competition in a UK
market” according to the Office of
Fair Trading (OFT) under the En-
terprise Act 2002. The OFT will re-
fer any merger that will result in a
turnover above a certain threshold,
or will result in the company having
over 25% of a market to the Compe-
tition Commission (CC), which is an
independent body, for investigation.
The OFT wants to encourage a fair
market where there is not a mo-
nopoly and normal market forces
apply to protect the consumer. If
these rules were not employed, mo-
nopolies would be formed with sup-
ply being manipulated and prices
increasing dramatically.
In the year 2000, Time Warner
and AOL planned to merge in what
would create a company worth $245
billion. With both being huge mul-
tinational companies, the takeo-
ver would be heavily scrutinised
to make sure there was not a de-
crease in competition and that a
monopoly was not formed. Of par-
ticular concern was the links be-
tween Time Warner with EMI and
Bertelsmann. It was worried that
AOL would be able to use EMI and
Bertelsmann to dominate the then
merging online music industry. To
avoid a monopoly in this area, it was
agreed that Time Warner would not
merge with EMI as had been earlier
planned, and that all ties with Ber-
telsmann would be severed. With
these promises, the EU gave the
go ahead for the merger, and with
some negotiations in America with
US regulators, AOL Time Warner
was formed.
Merger control regimes are there
to help protect the consumer by
making sure competition in a mar-
ket continues. Companies have to
abide by their rulings but can often
be proactive in making sure that
they are not substantially affecting
competition. Companies can agree
to sell off parts of their business to
make sure that they do not get an
unfair advantage from a subsidiary
or do not have a monopoly in a geo-
graphical area. With these rules fol-
lowed, normal market forces will al-
low businesses to run healthily and
consumers experience competitive
prices.
What can you do with a paper clip?
These are the words that sparked
off the creative energy of those
present at the first team build-
ing event on Tuesday evening of
SparkACompany, an interuniversi-
ty business competition run by Im-
perial Entrepreneurs and LSE En-
trepreneurs which intends to help
accelerate 6 student start ups by
March 2007. The night played host
to some of the top entrepreneurs in
the country as both societies aimed
to ignite the entrepreneurial scene
at Imperial by getting students to
actively start building companies.
The first in a series of events saw
the members primed for entrepre-
neurial and creative thought by ac-
tively engaging with the impressive
guest list of entrepreneurs present,
including a famous alumnus of
Imperial, Paul Birch who founded
bebo.com and Birthday Alarm. Also
present on the night were James
Murray Wells, UK Entrepreneur of
the year 2005 and founder of glass-
esdirect.co.uk, Walid Al Saqqaf and
Sokratis Papafloratos, founders of
trustedplaces.com and recent Im-
perial Graduate Sachin Duggal, a
millionaire at the age of 18.
The evening kicked off with a
little bit of light networking over
some drinks and pizza, and an in-
troduction by Imperial Entrepre-
neurs President Sumon Sadhu.
“There are many students at Im-
perial who have amazing business
ideas, but are afraid to go out and
just do it because of a lack of sup-
port, SparkACompany provides just
that, we’ve secured the business
services of companies like Ernst &
Young (accounting), Olswang (law)
“Go straight to jail, do not pass go,
do not collect £200”, a particularly
harsh punishment for someone at-
tempting to create a monopoly of all
the hotels in London. Whilst just a
board game, it does reflect parts of
the business world.
A monopoly occurs when there is
just one company providing a good
to the market. This total dominance
means that the monopoly is in total
control of supply and can therefore
control prices.
Monopolies can happen when a
government creates or gives the
rights for one to be created usually
with regards to a public service. It
also occurs more naturally, when a
company takes control of the mar-
ket through economies of scale or
having the sole rights to a resource
or idea.
For years, the Royal Mail has
been a government owned mo-
nopoly. If you had wanted to send a
letter, you had to do it via the Royal
Mail. However, it is carefully regu-
lated by Postcomm. This regulation
ensures that Royal Mail provides a
good service at a reasonable price
for the customers, so its monopoly
was not taken advantage of. Al-
though still dominant, the market
has been opened up to competition
with other carriers being allowed to
deliver post. This should help keep
prices and services competitive.
Microsoft’s Windows runs on
90% of all desktop computers. They
achieved this through the peoples
want for Windows as an operat-
ing system, particularly in the cor-
porate market, along with a lot of
hard work. However many people
believe that Microsoft intimidates
other companies either intention-

and WPP (marketing) to get all our
young start ups off the ground”,
said SparkACompany head Jayraj
Chokshi. Sumon Sadhu, a serial
entrepreneur at the age of 23, said
“London is probably the best place
in Europe to start a company and
Imperial offers the largest con-
centration of technically minded
students to create billion dollar
companies like Google, EBay and
Amazon”.
Much of the rest of the evening

ally by trying to squeeze them out
of the market with their own prod-
ucts or unintentionally by scaring
them from rivalling such a large
company. The EU agrees with this
and has demanded that Microsoft
opens up codes to rivals to allow
them to develop compatible pro-
grammes, with Microsoft facing
fines of $2 million a day.
Sometimes monopolies are sen-
sible, in particular when dealing
with a public service, such as water
or electricity, where it would be far
too expensive for every company to
have their own pipes or wires going
in to your house. In such instances,
it is important that such monopo-
lies are carefully regulated to pro-
tect the consumer. However, other
times monopolies occur through
other means. Because this is not
illegal it is important to make sure
that monopolies do not abuse their
powers with regulators protecting
consumers, or consumers protect-
ing themselves by taking their mon-
ey elsewhere.
off each other. Walid and Socratis,
provided the most engaging ques-
tion of the night when they asked
the audience “What can you do with
a paperclip?” and started off a wave
of crazy, imaginative and some
down right off the wall ideas!
It seemed to have worked though,
some genuinely intriguing and
wacky ideas were brought up, in-
cluding the suggestion of curing
AIDS with a paperclip! By painting
it red and giving it to U2’s frontman
Bono to launch a new charitable
effort, “Red clips for AIDS cam-
paign!”. There was also an airline
idea where passengers are carried
in sleeping capsules (which appar-
ently can be ejected and parachut-
ed to safety in the event of a crash!)
and a more down to earth proposal
which focused around low-fare Lon-
don travel on buses with no seats.
The evening closed off with a
Dragon’s Den style public pitch-
ing of ideas. All the entrepreneurs
present on the night were called up
to the front with each of the teams
pitching their idea to them. The idea
was then developed further by eve-
ryone brainstorming it up to a more
marketable proposition, which
gave a unique insight into how real
entrepreneurs turn a crazy concept
into scaleable reality.
The competition now moves into
its next phase on 22 November at
the LSE where the actual team
building process will gather pace
and new companies will be formed.
