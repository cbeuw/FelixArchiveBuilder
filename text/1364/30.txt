First up, I’d like to offer a big
Scrubs-style “Mistaaaaaake!” to
whoever thought Miss Rowlands
would make a good Sports Editor.
Anyway, a surprisingly sober
team arrived at Mile End for the
first mens match of the season,
and the game started at a lightning
pace. The aggressive RSM team
sent wave after wave of intimidat-
ing strikes into the heart of the QM
defence. The inevitable goal, how-
ever, was provided by a horrific foul
by the keeper resulting in a penalty
flick. Mikey stood up to take one for
the team, and this time his match
nerves didn’t let him down. He got
up faster than the Hoff on heat, into
the top left corner: well in my son.
After that the pace increased, but
without any further goals up to half-
time. After an awe-inspiring team
talk by skipper Tim about using the
wings and passing more, Tom took
the ball from push back through all
ten outfield players before planting
it in the net, all by himself – that’s
fucking teamwork. Leon and Sam
L both created chances which
Tom, predictably, failed to convert,
although he did go on to score a
couple more from his 100-or-so
open goal opportunities. Mikey
also scored again off a selfless as-
sist from Kwesi. Yung took Man of
the Match for his continuous and
unrelenting attacks from right half,
making the opposition shake with
terror when faced with such odds.
Mikey took Thanks for Coming for
being green carded for his consist-
ently shit tackles, on the edge of his
own D (we didn’t need his goals ei-
IC 3rds XV reached Surrey’s pitch
in the mood to return to their win-
ning streak. After a demolishing
start to the season, with 86-0 and
17-12 victories BUSA got more com-
plicated with an 87-5 defeat against
Portsmouth last week.
Spirits were high as the starting
XV positioned themselves to re-
ceive the kick-off. Outside centre
Charlie (Lock-Up) Davidson was
looking very eager to prove his
might in the backs.
The match started as a clash of
forwards, with Surrey never stand-
ing a chance. The 3rds strongest
pack of forwards so far, led by the
power of Sach (the brown bullet),
had control of every scrum.
It did not take long for, captain,
Ben (Pork Chop) Thompson to
break away. After a succession of
excellent handling skills, winger,
RSM mens hockey, and some women who choose to play with them occasionally since: “Womens hockey is just pointless – infact it’s full of
negative points!” (the beer is a figment of your imagination)

ther). Special mention to Simon for
clearing up after everyone’s mis-
takes in central defence and mak-
ing several crucial tackles, many in
a 2-on-1 situation, because the rest
of the team was trying to get some
action at the other end of the pitch.
There were good all-round per-
formances from Joe, Anthony, Sam
P and John, who had to deal with
a number of QM counter-attacks
that the midfield were too plain lazy
to bother with. Last but not least,
cheers to Ade for his efforts in goal;

Alice Rowlands’ response:
An anonymous team member up-
set that they “never get their arse
licked in these reports”, was keen
to point out that “Tom [Diaper] is
not a selfish player and happily
passes the ball, or would if Mikey
were fit enough to keep up.”
It was also suggested that, not
only are “Queen Mary’s dog shit”
but infact, “they’re all shite. It will
be easy!”, but also RSM will “dick
on everyone in their league.”
Recalling most of the match
proved difficult but; “Mikey’s sec-
ond goal was probably quite good”
(the first being a penalty flick won
by Tom Diaper). The only other
memorable events were some
fabululous solo (but unselfish)
Jerome took the ball to score under
the posts; converted by his fellow
Frenchman Antoine.
Surrey sprang back to life and,
after an unlucky bounce from the
scrum-half’s chip he collected his
own kick to run it under the posts,
the un-converted try tightening the
score.
IC, never allowing their grasp of
the game to evade them, picked up
their game and pushed harder than
ever allowing Pork Chop to show
his immense skill and footwork in
scoring the second try; thus send-
ing the teams to half-time with a
score of 12-5.
The start of the second half was
enlightened by the appearance of
Sacho (the mean menace) Relaxo
and his team of mighty forwards;
deciding it was time to show Sur-
rey what they were made of. Surrey
felt the wrath of the IC players; who
turned around every scrum int the
first 20 minutes.

IC never gave up in their ambition

their perseverance was rewarded
with inside centre Tom Bury run-

which resulted in a goal.
Where man of the match was
concerned, the person in question
thought that having Mikey as man
of the match was appalling due to
his general shitness. Pikey should
have been a contender for good
running and hitting, although
awarding it to Tom Diaper would
also have been a fair result.
nal score being 26-15. Man of the
Match was Tom Bury and Twat of
the Match was Borja Sordo for his
fashion faux-pas; wearing luminous
orange long sleeves under his kit.
