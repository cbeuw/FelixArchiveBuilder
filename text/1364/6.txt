Why are scientists paid so poorly?
Before going any further, I’d like
to make clear that I have no inten-
tion of moaning about how equally
qualified and wonderful scien-
tists are in comparison with their
suited counterparts in a certain
quadrilateral region of the capital.
Financial institutions make large
profits. Research departments do
not. The people who work in them,
myself included, cannot expect the
taxpayer to fork out large salaries
just because “you could be working
for Citigroup if you wanted to”. The
point I would like to make is this. If
you look at the fastest growing in-
dustry sectors in the world today,
the vast majority will have some
kind of technological innovation
behind them. If you trace this in-
novation back to its origin, you will
eventually come face to face with
a scientist or an engineer. There-
fore, science provides a huge driv-
ing force for the growth of industry
and the creation of wealth. It is in
many ways ultimately responsible
for the success of the large compa-
nies from which the financial insti-
tutions derive their wealth.
Why, then, are scientists so bad
at retaining any of this wealth they
have created for themselves? The
root cause may be the very culture
surrounding scientific research
itself. Understandably, scientists
want to get on with science, but
there is also a rather unhelpful at-
titude held by a few whereby any in-
volvement with money is somehow

William Bains, a leading entrepreneur and visiting professor
seen as undignified and a sign of
moral inferiority.
Thankfully, all traces of this mind-
set are disappearing fast. Univer-
sities like Imperial are becoming
hot beds for entrepreneurial activ-
ity and Gordon Brown himself has
declared: “The new Britain will be
built on skills, science and enter-
prise… these are the best means
to raising our national game and
driving forward productivity and
prosperity.”
Last week, I had the pleasure of
meeting William Bains, one of the
country’s leading bioscience en-
trepreneurs and visiting professor
at Imperial. Over the last twenty
years, Professor Bains has been
heavily involved in the commer-
cialisation of new biotechnology. He
has founded three companies and
been involved in countless others.
For several years he worked for
an investment fund called Merlin
Bioscience, which specialises in
investing in and helping to steer
bio-tech start-up companies to-
ward financial success. During this
time he sorted through thousands
of new business ideas, picking out
those with the most potential. He
has even managed to condense his
knowledge into several books and a
lecture course as part of Cambridge
University’s Bioscience Enterprise
course.
The pharmaceuticals industry is
so attractive because it has con-
sistently been the most profitable
worldwide for over thirty years.
Not only can you save lives, you can
also become obscenely wealthy at
the same time. Recently, however,
the cost of discovering and develop-
ing a new drug has increased dra-
matically. The simple drugs have
already been discovered, and find-
ing new ones is taking ever longer.
It now costs an average of around
$800 million to get a new drug onto
the shelves, and this figure runs
into billions if you consider the cost
of all the failed attempts. Professor
Bains’ latest business, Delta G, is
currently leading a quiet revolution
in the drugs discovery industry.
Delta G is based on research into
mitochondrial bioenergetics. Using
an understanding of how mitochon-
dria fail as we age, they are working
to develop novel pharmaceuticals to
treat a variety of cancers. Already
several patents have been filed, and
they hope to be able to license their
technology to larger pharmaceuti-
cal companies who will help deliver
the drug to the marketplace.
On Wednesday 21 November, Pro-
fessor Bains is coming to Imperial
where he will be talking not only
about his new business, but also
about entrepreneurship in general.
He will be offering his accumulated
insight and wisdom on how best
to launch your own start-up. So if
you’re interested in science, busi-
ness, or possibly even both, this
might be an evening well spent.
William Bains will be speaking
as part of an event hosted by IC
Entrepreneurs on 21 November
at 6.30pm in the Tanaka Business
School. The event is open to both
staff and students.
