Guildsheet impounded
On Wednesday morning, the Re-
turning Officer for the NUS refer-
endum, Jon Matthews, took the un-
usual step of impounding a student
publication after a complaint by the
Yes campaign.
The complaint, submitted by Alex
Guite, leader of the Yes campaign,
concerned Guildsheet, the City &
Guilds College Union newspaper.
The No campaign had approached
the editor, Tristan Sherliker, and
asked to place an advert in the No-
vember issue. The Yes campaign
did not. Mr Sherliker duly charged
the campaign for the advert, and
published it in the issue he distrib-
uted around campus on Tuesday
evening.
The Yes campaign, on seeing
the newspaper, submitted a com-
plaint, the gist of which was that
Mr Sherliker hadn’t approached
them to place an advert, knowing
that the No campaign already had
an advert. Mr Matthews response
was to tour the campus with Felix’s
distribution trolley and seize all the
available copies of Guildsheet, stop-
ping short of taking it from people’s
hands.
Mr Sherliker responded to the
complaint by pointing out that one
of the prominent members of the
Yes campaign, John Collins (who is
also Union President, though act-
ing in a personal capacity for this
referendum), was a previous Guild-
sheet editor, and therefore should
have known that advertising in the
newspaper was possible.
Mr Collins responded in kind by
saying that if he was Guildsheet
editor, he’d have approached the
Yes campaign in the hope of making
more money from their advert.
The move to impound Guildsheet
met with widespread criticism from
the No campaign, and guarded
skepticism from the Yes camp.
Stephen Brown, a well-known fig-
urehead for the No camp, said:
“The rules say that both sides of
the argument must have equal ac-

cess to media, whether or not they
choose to take advantage of it is
entirely up to them. It’s a bit like A-
NUS complaining that the Yes cam-
paign have posters up everywhere,
but we can’t be arsed making any so
we’d like the returning officer to or-
der the removal of all theirs.”
Alex Guite, who made the initial
complaint, commented regarding
the impounding: “No part of this
situation pleases me. I made a
complaint because I felt we hadn’t
been offered fair access to student
media.” Mr Guite does have a good
record on freedom of the press; as
Physical Science Union President,
he was the first to make Broad-
sheet, the PSU newspaper, edito-
rally independent and increased its
budget, and he stood by Matthew
Hartfield, its editor last year, when
attempts were made to reverse
these changes.
Mr Matthews spoke to Felix about
the impounding, saying: “This was
an unfortunate event, but I took
the steps necessary to protect the
referendum.” He also raised the
alarming possibility of votes cast
during the period that Guildsheet
was available being discounted if
analysis of voting times showed that
these votes changed the outcome of
the referendum. This was met with
outrage by Stephen Brown, a well-
known No campaigner, who pointed
out that during the evening Guild-
sheet was available, the size of the
“No NUS” group on Facebook more
than tripled, and that some of these
people may have voted during that
evening, completely unrelated to
Guildsheet advert, and that these
voters would be disenfranchised.
Mr Matthews referred to prec-
edent when defending his decision;
apparently, ex-President Mustafa
Arif had interpreted an election
regulation concerning student
media interviewing candidates or
publishing debates requiring three
days notice to all candidates as ap-
plying to advertising as well.
The NUS referendum descends into farce, with Guildsheet impounded and talk of conspiracy on campus
