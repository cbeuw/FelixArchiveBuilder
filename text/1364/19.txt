Yours truly with that hideously pretentious pose
as well as the production manager,
Mary, and her assistant, Jacque-
line. Everyone was friendly and it
became apparent to me that they
were extremely focused on the task
at hand; a personal trait that I would
really become aware of once the fif-
teen-hour day had finished. Arriving
at the men’s club, everything was in
place: the catering van, Winnebago,
and make-up lorry. I was drawn to-
wards a small argument that was
within the main marquee. A wavy-
haired Irish man was disputing
something with a security guard. I
introduced myself and questioned:
“What’s going on?”, rather feebly
thinking I could help. “Are you ‘lo-
cations’?” asked Paul, the Irish ‘1st
AD’ or ‘First Assistant Director’.
At this point, I was stumped by in-
dustry buzzwords. Prior to working
on I Am Bob, I’d never worked on a
short film and my other experienc-
es were at a television production
company and a film distributor. Al-
though these taught me a lot about
the media industry, I was in a whole
new world.
My initial impression of Paul
wasn’t entirely positive; he felt
needlessly aggressive to me, but
ultimately it stemmed from his fo-
cused attitude. As the ‘1st AD’, or
effectively the director’s right hand
man, he needed to whip people into
shape, for example, by getting ac-
tors on set pronto or shots filmed as
quickly and efficiently as possible.
He was certainly capable of doing
this and I respected him for it.
Jean arrived late but leisurely. My
role as location runner would begin
in earnest. Jean was ‘unit manag-
er’, and it was our duty to ensure
that everything ran smoothly; by
maintaining safety such as making
sure wires are gaffer taped down,
keeping the nearby residents, as
well as club members and owners,
happy, and also keeping working
conditions pleasant. Although I
was assigned to be Jean’s gimp, I
tried to chip in wherever help was
required.
By 8am, the location was buzzing.
There was a hive of activity as peo-
ple rushed around preparing for the
day’s filming to begin. I met Patrick,
who was essentially the chief run-
ner. Having worked with Paul many
times before, he was an old hand.
Patrick spoke in a hushed voice, giv-
ing little indication of his vast run-
ning experience. He seemed very
timid to me initially and as time pro-
gressed his manner didn’t change.
However, this just endeared him to
me since he was clearly without a
swollen ego. One extra I spoke to
claimed fame by reminding us he
was one of the soldiers in the Gladi-
ator battle scenes. In some senses
he was wrong though; he was prob-
ably thousands of people in Gladi-
ator, replicated over and over via
the wonders of CGI! If Patrick was
the Alfred Hitchcock of the running
world, then I’m Eli Roth, bursting
onto the scene.
Gradually the other runners
turnedup.Whilstmyexperiencewas
minuscule compared to Patrick’s, I
met Will who was a painter living in
Notting Hill. The boot was on the
other foot since he’d never worked
in film or television before. Whilst
competition in the film industry is
infamously fierce, team spirit on
set was always high; nowhere more
so than between the runners. Run-
ners don’t have careers and egos to
flaunt, so conversation was light-
heartedandjovial.Similarlytothose
trepidatious first days at university
discussing your A-Levels with fel-
low freshers, inevitable discussion
concerning previous industry expe-
rience abounds. This is not a prob-
lem until you begin probing more
experienced crew members about
their past work. Naturally, you want
to make a good impression with the
prospect of opening doors in the in-
dustry. But, whilst I talked to Jean
for instance, a slightly slimy ‘suck-
ing-up’ sensation would creep over
me. Tact is the order of the day in
this industry.
The set was dressed and filming
would be taking place shortly. Walk-
ing through the dancehall, carefully
hopping over the endless camera
and lighting cables, it began to
dawn on me that this was some-
thing special I had managed to
become involved with. Attention to
detail on set was astounding, right
down to notice boards with fake taxi
companies and sleazy fliers demon-
strating multi talented young la-
dies’ services. The art department
was very talented, whilst consisting
of merely three members.
Sir Bob Geldof, or ‘Bob’ as I may of
course refer to him, arrived. Heads
turned, fingers pointed and jaws
temporarily stopped chatting. Then
it was back to all hands on deck.
After relaxing briefly in the hired
Winnebago, make-up and wardrobe
had their way with him and he was
escorted straight to set.
T
he time had come to be-
gin filming. The script
had been nurtured and
the pregnancy was over.
Four days of labour were
about to be braved. The short film
was born in front of my eyes – it was
exciting and inspiring viewing. The
finest attention to detail is observed
at all times. Lighting, sound, art,
acting, and direction are combined
to produce something entertaining
and, in this case, extremely funny.
As the hard work comes to fruition,
satisfaction cascades, building with
each successful camera set up. I
believe it’s for this reason that peo-
ple genuinely love working in the
industry. Aside from the potential
of a luxurious lifestyle, endeavour-
ing to produce something that will
impress and entertain people is in-
credibly rewarding. There are few
media better for doing this than in
cinema.
The realisation that I Am Bob was
a rather large ‘short feature’ began
to set in once I witnessed the scale
of professionalism. Patrick had
never worked on anything of this
scale and Jean reminded me that
plenty of shorts are filmed in a bed-
room with perhaps a cameraman,
director and an actor. I felt very
fortunate.
Filming continued throughout
the day. Extra after extra appeared
from the wardrobe department’s
magic lorry, dressed with varying
degrees of spoof-dom . Personal
favourites included Mother There-
sa played by a frail and stubborn
eighty-something, Sir Elton John
imitated by a London cabbie driver
and Audrey Hepburn who looked
simply gorgeous. Less convincing,
but equally hilarious was an over-
weight Superman, a hulking Conan
the Barbarian and none other than
America’s most wanted: Osama
Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.
However David Bamber stole the
show for me: imitating none other
Maxine Peake as Marilyn Monroe
