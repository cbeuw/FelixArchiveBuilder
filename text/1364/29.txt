IC Rowers all at BUSA
Mentionrowingandmostpeopleim-
mediately think of either pottering
along the Serpentine in Hyde Park,
or a bunch of lycra clad nutters get-
ting up ridiculously early to train
for an even more ridiculous length
of time. Love it or loath it most peo-
ple will have heard of, or been too
(especially if you were schooled at a
fee paying institution) a lovely part
of the world called Henley-upon-
Thames. This is the highlight of the
rowing calendar, and a win there in
the summer makes all the ridicu-
lous training worth it.
In July, Henley is the finishing
line at the end of a gruelling obsta-
cle course of competitive rowing
races. No obstacle course is easy,
but in order to reach the finish you
have to complete all the challenges
along the way.
This time of year involves the long
slog ‘head’ races, including the four
an a quarter mile Head of the River
Race, and also more welcome trips
to Amsterdam for the Heineken
Cup. Last weekend however saw
the completion of BUSA small
boats head, the boggy marsh on
the assault course. It was an unre-
quited necessity in search of BUSA
points to secure further funding for
Imperial rowing and sport in gen-
eral. This event is notoriously badly
run, with that ‘no one really knows’
kind of work ethic to the marshals
running it.
But luckily through a combina-
tion of talent and the silly train-
ing, Imperial rowers tend to be the
commanders on the assault course.
Out of the 12 small boat categories,
for both men and women, Imperial
took 9 golds and 2 silvers, medalling
in every category they entered and
taking home three times as many
BUSA points as any other Universi-
ty. This is an even more impressive
achievement due to the high stand-
ard of the top end entries. Congrats
to the men’s team of Will Laughton,
Adam Freeman-Pask, Olly Moore,
Ben Smith and Ole Tiertz, and
the ladies team of Mathilda Pauls,
Cynthia Mynhardt, Helen Ellison,
outgoing women’s captain Rach-
ael ‘chewy’ Davies, Kay Jacks and
Clarice Chung. This result firmly
places IC at the pinicle of student
rowing in the country.

One Wednesday in November, 12
warriors travelled from South Ken
to the depths of North West London
anticipating one of the fiercest bat-
tles ever.
From the tip off Imperial were
in control, looking like champions,
but in skin tight kit. Every offence
was sexy and Westminster couldn’t
cope. We were playing perfect bas-
ketball, setting screens, rolling, cut-
ting, working hard on defence, max-
ing and relaxing.
By the end of the first quarter
Imperial were dominating 28-6, the
only criticism being that they were
allowed to score 6.
Words of encouragement issued
going into the second quarter
were “these guys are big, but very
stupid”. Imperial restarted im-
pressively with Rob scoring from
outside and Naaman working the
inside well.
Midway through the second quar-
ter with Imperial running the show,
Westminster began to press, forc-
ing turnovers and fouls. Imperial
struggled to pass out of the press,
turning over the ball and dropping
baskets.
Today was an important day for the
1st team in terms of position in the
league, by winning we would secure
the top spot in the league, and our
opponents today were a team that
had not won a game so far.
Preparation for the game went
smoothly, although with 45 minutes
‘till kick off, there was neither an
opposition nor a referee. Both even-
tually did arrive and the game got
underway. IC started the first half
with all guns blazing, and even the
forwards had something to shout
about as they won a lineout and
drove it over the line, to give Alex
Baines-Buffery his first try this
season. The second try for IC game
fairly quickly after that, with James
Fletcher intercepting a pass from
their fly-half but the conversion was
missed.
Things were going well with
movement general yet again work-
ing perfectly, but then 20 minutes
in, the game turned with the ref-
eree awarding a controversial pen-
alty try to South Bank, even though
they’d already passed the try line.
Their second try was yet another
penalty try as Rob Phillipps held
back the runner on his way to the
try line, and IC could have conced-
ed a third as Baines-Buffery tackled
a guy 5 meters from our line, with-
out the guy actually having the ball.
Half time score was 14-12 to South
Bank.

ond half, and they did with several
substitutions. First was Jov, who
still hasn’t managed to finish a full
game, with a suspected broken
thumb; then eventually Jo Brown
who just woke up of the pitch, not
too sure how he got there. But
on the pitch, things weren’t go-
ing well; with South Bank getting
a further two tries through some
quick hands in the backs. IC were
not having the best of days, with
balls being dropped at crucial mo-
ments and the forwards being a bit
hesitant in the rucks, meant that
none of our opportunities were
ever finished. But after South Bank
scored their two tries, things fell
into place with a try from Flannan
(finally) in the corner, where Fletch
managed to drop kick the conver-
sion and then some good phases
from the forwards to allow Hixxy
over the line under the posts, which
Fletch converted easily.
The game finished after that fi-
nal conversion, but with neither
side sure of who’d won. No one was
sure whether it was 28-26 to South
Bank or 26-24 to IC since everyone
seemed to have lost track of the
conversions. In the end, the referee
decided it was a draw at 26 all, to
which both teams were surprised
yet no complaints were made. Spe-
cial mentions go to Luke Taylor
a.k.a. ACC Chair, a.k.a. Sanders
mark II, a.k.a. Leadership Taylor,
a.k.a ‘Twat of the Match’ (for not
getting on the pitch after 3 weeks
off), and to Alex ‘I’m better than
Luke’ Johnstone for a great per-
formance as hooker which earned
him ‘Man of the Match’.

Westminster began to find their
rhythm offensively. A poor 2nd
quarter and some questionable
score-keeping reduced Imperial’s
lead to 8 at the half, 36-28.
Imperial tried to resume ear-
lier form, and Westminster tried to
close the gap. Exchanging baskets
for most of the quarter Imperial
looked solid.

conceded easy baskets, and trailed
by 2 going into the 4th, 50-52.
In the final quarter, G. Kyriakides
and J. Gardiner came out strong,
scoring important points on the fast
break. Imperial trailed by three for
most of the quarter but began to
look strong when faced with defeat.
We scored important points by
breaking their zone with good out-
side shooting, but were still leak-
ing baskets on defence. When it
mattered, with minutes left on the
clock and Westminster in team foul
trouble, Imperial drove hard to the
hoop drawing fouls. A. Ponjavic
converted 3 from 4 at the line to tie
the game 69-69.
The game went into extra time
with Imperial continuing to put
points up. Hitting shots from out-
side and drawing fouls to go to the
line, Imperial ran away with the
win, 85-74.
