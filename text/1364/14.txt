Everybody’s changing; Keane don’t
Keane wow the audience at Alexandra Palace with their typical blend of boyishness, ballads and Bedshaped
“The choir of the city of London,
he we go!” Blared Tom Chaplin,
the front-man of the piano-driven
three-piece known as Keane. Al-
ready into the chorus of Somewhere
Only We Know, the eight-thousand
strong crowd, bristling with energy,
responded, screaming out into the
night. We provided the backing vo-
cals for Keane as the brilliant vocals
of Tom, the symphonic genius of pi-
anist Tim Rice-Oxley and the eclec-
tic drumming of Richard Hughes
gave London what it came to hear:
sheer musical magnificence.
The opening act, Captain, pro-
vided the crowd with a bizarre but
mesmerizing sound-scape whose
guitar and synthesising perform-
ance kept the audience’s atten-
tion, but they were soon eclipsed
by the main act. Keane blew us all
away right from the start with the
opening instrumental Iron Sea, and
cheers exploded towards the stage
as each of the trio individually made
their journey onto the stage at the
glorious Alexandra Palace.
During each and every song,
the audience participation was as-
tounding. Everyone knew every
word and it pleased Keane no doubt
that they were standing above us
all watching us in unison sing along
to the likes of Leaving So Soon, Try
Again and Everybody’s Changing.
The latter of which caused hands to
simultaneously reach towards the
ceiling in such an amazing display
it can only be described as epic.
The stage itself was incredible;
the lightning effects were, honestly,
second-to-none, and the plasma
screens provided images relevant
to each song. A Bad Dream, a very
atmospheric song about war was
accompanied by images of people
trying to evade the bombings and
frantically put on their gas masks,
and it helped provide a sense of
awe I haven’t experienced since the
likes of Radiohead.
Of course, Keane are a piano-led
three-piece, but that didn’t stop
Tom bringing out an acoustic guitar
for a very rare acoustic version of
Your Eyes Open, much to every-
one’s delight. He claimed not to be
able to play it very well but it was
pretty hard to tell as it could barely
be heard over the audience’s roar-
ing collective voice.
One of the many highlights of
the gig was Hamburg Song, es-
sentially their version of Coldplay’s
The Scientist, (apologies for the
obvious comparison), which filled
the venue with heartfelt emotion
and it seemed to really touch the
audience. Written by the primary
composer of Keane, Tim, it was, in
Tom’s own words, “A request for me
to become the person I was instead
of the person I became”.
Tom’s banter with the crowd was
the best I have heard. Poking fun at
himself about his recent rehabilita-
tion, referring to the audience as
their ‘choir’ and ‘the most beauti-
ful people of London’ and playfully
referring to the venue as Ally Pally.
It reached a brilliant and sudden
live reviews
Keane
Alexandra Palace
climax when he jumped into the
crowd, singing to specific people
and causing thousands to swarm
around him.
The encore was suitably atmos-
pheric, with Atlantic producing a
very dark, brooding mood which
was suddenly shattered as Crystal
Ball’s upbeat lyrics reigned down
upon the thousands of fans. Bed-
shaped was, as usual, chosen as the
closing song, and proved to be the
best conclusion to a gig in recent
memory. As the thousands sang
along, Tom clearly showed some
signs of faltering as the true emo-
tion of the gig overwhelmed him,
and the beauty of the song itself
was clear to see and to hear.
From the thunderous pseudo-
guitar track Is It Any Wonder to
the calming, saddening We Might
As Well Be Strangers, Keane show-
cased their entire second album
and the best of their first with un-
deniable skill.
The audience participation, the
musical quality, and overall the al-
most-tangible bond Keane seemed
to have with the crowd was inde-
scribable, but I’ve given it my best
shot, and I’m afraid that will have to
suffice. To truly appreciate Keane,
as you would any band, you have to
go see them for yourselves. I could
hardly recommend this band any-
more than this.
One thousand lucky members of
the audience received copies of this
gig recorded to CD, and if you lis-
ten carefully you can hear someone
shout out “Imperial” during one of
the quieter moments. In compari-
son to Keane’s contribution to the
lives of thousands of music fans, my
attempted advertisement of this
fine institution seems pretty mea-
gre. Nevertheless, it does prove
that I was there, and that is what
truly matters to me and many oth-
ers; we were there to experience
something incredibly difficult to put
down in words.

Les Incompetents
100 Club
Les Incompetents, like The Sur-
faris and Dire Straits, had me
intrigued on the basis of a catchy
name. Me? Easy to please? Yes,
yes I am thank you, thank you very
much.
I was pre-warned that they were
also pretty big news in London and
arriving at the 100 Club into a hot,
sweaty basement crammed like a
pack of sardines – that is, sardines
wearing trilbies and cravats – I re-
alised how right that was. I sigh as
I make my way through the crowds,
and reluctantly hand over £1.30 for
half a can of diet coke. The music
better be good.
Les Incompetents start setting up
on-stage,andunfortunately,withme
being a meagre 5’3”, my view is not
spectacular. I see glimpses of suits,
waistcoats and silver sequined
head bands. The singer looks like a
mutant hybrid of Rivers Cuomo and
Jarvis Cocker, assembled in the un-
derground sewers of London per-
haps. His girlfriend Peaches walks
past me, and I live up to my repu-
tation of being a little slow when I
realise the old guy behind her is her
dad. What’s his name? Bob Geldof!
The bewilderment is then replaced
by a great huge stabbing pain when
he steps on my foot.
Sounds starts to fill the air; loud
bursts of energetic sound that hit
your face with a whack. They are
really pulling out all the stops to-
night. I hear jangly melodies around
ska-beats and tweaky guitars. The
words Babyshambles, The Liber-
tines and a smidgen of Reel Big
Fish come to mind, but there’s also
a form of innocence and fun that
makes Les Incompetents stand
out. They play a full back catalogue
of songs including crowd-pleasers
How It Went Wrong, the clappy gui-
tar explosion Reunion, that is sung
so close to being out of tune it works,
and Much Too Much. They look a
wreck on-stage and the dry asides
are plentiful and sarcastic, but the
sound is tight, passionate and if you
listen carefully, you can hear tech-
nical brilliance. The crowd is gratu-
itously loyal, shouting out requests,
singing to their heart’s content and
starting what looks like a monster
mash-up in front. Dancing becomes
infectious with symptoms ranging
from the head-bob, to a fever of jazz
hands and then the acute flinging of
one’s legs.
Ironically, a new song is played,
which is almost too much of a cock-
tease for the crowd. The audience
lap up a pretty shoddy cover of
the White Stripes, but at this point
they’d jump for glee if the band
threw human faeces, or even mar-
bles at them. Which they did. The
marbles I mean.
The hour long set goes by quick-
ly, mainly due to restarting Much
Too Much five times as a dig to the
redundant previous bassist Ollie
Rose (a quick check on Wikipedia
quotes that he was forced to leave
the band when his guitar was ‘sto-
len by a gypsy’). Although I do like
the sound of Billy’s voice (a twang
of drunken slurring and that cliché
London accent; better than your
Irish/South African/Klingon one
Luke of The Kooks) his interludes
of random heckling and antics did
grow a bit tiresome.
The music stops and I come up
for air and a quick run to the tube
station. I’m sat waiting for Cockfos-
ters (the tube) and it hits me that
the beautiful mess of sound I’ve just
heard won’t ever be performed on-
stage again. Why the band are split-
ting up I’m not sure; irreconcilable
differences, new projects or maybe
they really are just incompetent.
But at least Geldof stood on my
foot.

Les Incompetents extremely competent last gig
