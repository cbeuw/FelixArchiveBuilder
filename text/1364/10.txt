B
rowsing the web-
site of the Imperial
Islamic Society the
otherday,Ihappened
upon an article enti-
tled “The Light of
Islam in Constanti-
nople”. Penned by Ibn Munir, the
article starts out by telling us that
“the city of Constantinople (com-
monly known today as Istanbul)
was enlightened and blessed with
Islam on 855 Hijri (1453 AD)”. The
desire on the part of the Ottoman
Turks to conquer what had been
Christendom’s leading city for over
a thousand years was, we are told,
founded on a saying of Muhammad,
in which he proclaimed that “Con-
stantinople will be conquered at the
hands of a man, so blessed be the
leader of that conquest and blessed
be that army!”
According to Mr Munir, Muham-
mad decided that Constantinople, a
city nearly 1,500 miles from Mecca,
was to be conquered by Muslim
force of arms. Despite the passage
of over 800 years, the force of this
exhortation inspired the Ottoman
Turks, a people originally from
Turkestan in Central Asia whose
ancestors were themselves con-
quered by the Arabs, to bring the
“light of Islam” to Constantinople.
This was a great “blessing” for the
city, we are told. What, one wonders,
did this “blessing” consist of?
Mr Munir’s article is rather
sketchy on the details, so we must
look elsewhere for them. Steven
Runciman, in his book The Fall of
Constantinople, describes how,
on breaching the walls, Muslim
soldiers “slew everyone that they
met in the streets, men, women,
and children without discrimina-
tion. The blood ran in rivers down
the steep streets from the heights
of Petra toward the Golden Horn.
But soon the lust for slaughter
was assuaged. The soldiers real-
ized that captives [i.e., slaves] and
precious objects would bring them
greater profit.” For those unfamil-
iar with the history, this was but the
climactic battle after centuries of
such warfare against the Byzantine
Empire.
It is not my intention here to
claim that the Turkish conquest of
Constantinople was any more bru-
tal than similar horrors carried out
by other medieval armies, includ-
ing, of course, European armies.
But it is essential to point out, how-
ever obvious it may seem, that all
this medieval brutality was indeed
medieval in nature, and it is for pre-
cisely this reason that decent peo-
ple in the 21st century are shocked
and disgusted by the violence per-
petrated by their ancestors.
No Englishman today celebrates
the horrendous violence inflicted
on the Scottish, Irish or Welsh pop-
ulations of the British Isles, and no
sane American looks back on the
1864 Sand Creek Massacre with a
sense of fond nostalgia. In contrast,
the Islamic Society is happy to post
articles which celebrate the unpro-
voked Muslim conquests of non-
Muslims, conquests which were
inspired by the founder of their
religion, and which were accompa-
nied by the slaughter, rape, pillage
and enslavement of the defeated
peoples.
As the debates about Islam’s role
in world conflict continue to rage
around us, we have been assured
repeatedly that Osama bin Laden
and his ilk constitute nothing more
than Islam’s lunatic fringe. In this
interpretation, far from being the
psychotic death-cult that it imper-
sonates so well, Islam is in fact a
religion of peace and tolerance. Yet
the Islamic Society openly gloats
over the brutality of its coreligion-
ists, brutality many orders of mag-
nitude greater than that of the 9/11
attacks, and, just as importantly,
brutality which has no conceivable
justification in terms of self-de-
fence, American forces stationed
in Saudi Arabia, unusual celestial
activity, or anything else.
Let us conduct a brief thought ex-
periment, in which a group of Impe-
rial students establishes a British
Empire Society. On its Union-pro-
vided website, it puts up an article
celebrating the way in which the
British Empire offered millions of
Africans, at no charge, the opportu-
nity to start a new life in the Ameri-
cas, working on a tobacco or sugar
plantation. This and other endeav-
ours on the part of said empire, the
article claims, are what brought
the light of civilization to Africans.
Such a development would clearly
be inconceivable, and utterly farci-
cal were it in fact to occur. Yet the
Islamic equivalent sits happily on
the website of the Islamic Soci-
ety, whose members presumably
consider it to be objective history
rather than the deluded and self-
congratulatory propaganda it so
manifestly is.
The lazy imprecision of the dis-
tinction so regularly drawn between
‘moderate’ and ‘extremist’ Muslims
has always bothered me, but, given
how widespread it has become, let
us adopt it here. I assume that the
members of the Islamic Society will
not self-identify as extremists. If,
however, they consider themselves
‘moderates’, is it unreasonable
to ask what the material on their
website tells us about ‘moderate’
Islam? I admit that it is unsettling
to ask these questions. But it is sui-
cidal not to ask them.
Samuel Lynas asks some unsettling questions about the articles on Imperial Islamic Society’s website
Islam, violence, and the empires
“The Islamic
Society is happy
to post articles
which celebrate
the unprovoked
Muslim
conquests of
non-Muslims…
inspired by the
founder of their
religion and…
accompanied by
the slaughter,
rape, pillage,
and enslavement
of the defeated
peoples”
