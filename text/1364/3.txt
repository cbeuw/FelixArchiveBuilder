New clubs wait two months to form
Delays in organising a new clubs committee has prevented the formation of any new clubs and societies
Richard Villabos
A number of prospective clubs are
becoming increasingly frustrated
by the inability of the sabbs to or-
ganise a new clubs committee. The
approval of this committee is re-
quired before clubs can start taking
membershipmoneyandplanevents
or trips. There are currently more
than 20 club applications awaiting
approval, some of which have been
waiting for almost two months.
James Millen, SCC Chair, ap-
proached Felix with concerns. Mr
Millen has been in constant contact
with the prospective clubs and their
possible members, providing them
with advice while they await approv-
al from the as yet unformed NCC.
Having clubs approved by the NCC
was a new measure introduced last
year, over concerns that the previ-
ous method was unsuitable. Prior
to the NCC, clubs would go to the
appropriate CSC chair (ACC, RCC,
or SCC) and ask to form. The club
committee would meet and vote
on whether to accept the club – of-
ten the SCC would accept the club,
as no-one wanted to be the one to
deny them, whereas the ACC’s of-
ten money-hungry clubs would vote
to reject the club to prevent money
being spread across more clubs.
The NCC was supposed to alleviate
this partisan nature, and is chaired
by the Deputy President (Finance
& Services).
Mr Millen told Felix that the new
clubs were becoming irritated with
the lack of action on the matter, and
that he was “fed up with waiting,”
adding that he was not the only
CSC who felt this way. Last year,
the NCC had no problem meeting,
and the clubs would be dealt with in
groups of 4-6 committee members.
Kirsty Patterson, who is proposing
the formation of a Fair Trade Soci-
ety, told Felix that she was “getting
rather angry” at the lack of action,
and commented that Mr Matthews,
who as DPFS will be chairing the
committee, had told her that the
NCC would meet two weeks ago.
She also made the point that her
application has been waiting for
almost two months, having being
submitted at the start of this term.
The matter was raised at Council
by Mr Millen and others, who ques-
tioned the motives behind the delay
of forming the NCC. It is known that
neither John Collins (Union Presi-
dent) or Jon Matthews are particu-
larly fond of the NCC, and some at
Council suggested that the delay
was an attempt to make the NCC
look ‘faulty’, allowing the two sabbs
to push approval of clubs back to
the CSC chairs, who are opposed to
such a change for the partisanship
it would bring.
Mr Matthews defended these
accusations, arguing that referen-
dum business had prevented him
from forming the committee. He
promised those present that the
committee would meet as soon as
possible after the announcement of
the referendum result. Mr Millen,
however, did not seem convinced.
“‘There’s been no time’ is just an
excuse, possibly a valid excuse, but
not a reason or a fault in the proc-
ess. The new method works.”
The RCC Chair, Mark Flower,
agreed with Mr Millen that the NCC
works well, and was again skeptical
of the reason given for not forming
a new NCC: “I honestly don’t under-
stand why we haven’t been able to
meet yet.” He also raised concerns
over the role of a Deputy Presi-
dent in the chair of the NCC, say-
ing: “Why can’t we meet with a CSC
chair or FU president in the chair,
given that the Deputy Presidents
don’t seem able to provide us with
their time?”
Commenting over the effect of the
long delay on the new clubs them-
selves, Mr Flower said: “I don’t rate
their chances at doing well this
year. No one is going to be inter-
ested in joining new clubs so late in
the year.
We should have met before term
started.”

UK universities invest £15.5m in arms firms
UK universities hold more than
£15.5m in shares of arms compa-
nies, and University of London col-
leges significantly contributing to
this figure, according to a report re-
leased this week by the Campaign
Against Arms Trade (CAAT).
CAAT asked UK institutions to
disclose any holdings they had in
firms that produce weapons, and
specifically those that have supplied
weapons to regimes they classify as
oppressive. 45 universities replied
saying they held shares in compa-
nies such as BAe Systems, Rolls
Royce, and Cobham. 33 universities
refused to reply, meaning the true
figure of arms holdings by UK uni-
versities could be even higher.
The university that has the larg-
est holdings in arms companies, of
those that replied, is University Col-
lege London, with £1.5m invested in
the firms listed by CAAT. Other in-
stitutions listed in the top ten were
King’s College, with almost £1m
invested, and a number of Oxford
and Cambridge colleges. The Uni-
versity of Manchester, which has
recently seen the students’ union
refuse to speak to the Vice Chan-
cellor over allegations concerning
arms dealing, invests £500,000 in
arms companies.
Although Imperial College does
not feature in the top ten, requests
answered under the Freedom of
Information Act (FoI) show that
the College has more than £350,000
invested in arms firms, including
those on CAAT’s list. These shares
are not direct holdings of the Col-
lege, put part of a ‘pooled fund’
managed by external financial com-
panies. The majority of the money
is invested into the Rolls Royce
Group, which has been implicated
in the selling of arms to countries
where human rights abuses are
taking place.
The FoI response also shows a
small investment in Halliburton
of £250, the company who won a
contract to provide rebuilding se-
curity in Iraq, and of which Dick
Cheney, Vice President of the USA,
was once a director. Halliburton
has been heavily criticised by the
Andy Sykes world press for possible misuse of
rebuilding money, and nepotism in
obtaining the contract. FoI requests
have also shown that Imperial has
received research grants totalling
more than £8.5m from arms manu-
facturing companies.
King’s College, which ranks as the
second biggest investor in London,
has faced flack from their student
body over the College’s shares.
Last year, when it was revealed by
CAAT that the College held a large
number of BAe Systems shares,
King’s College London Students’
Union (KCLSU) actively lobbied
the College to adopt an ethical in-
vestment policy. The College sub-
sequently sold its shares, but took
pains to point out that this was a
purely commercial decision, and
that they have no policy against
holding shares in ‘defence compa-
nies’. The College has also come
under fire for holding shares in
GKN and the Smiths Group, who
have sold arms to Libya and noted
human rights abuser Saudi Arabia.
LSE has drawn ire from its stu-
dent body for refusing to reveal its
investments, saying that these are
managed in an external ‘pooled
fund’ and therefore cannot be ob-
tained; however, this has failed to
wash with LSE Students’ Union,
as many other universities, includ-
ing Imperial, invest using the same
kind of fund, and have been able to
reveal their investments. The union
recently adopted an ethical invest-
ment policy, and has resolved to
lobby the School to do the same.
LSESU Environment & Ethics Of-
ficer, Aled Fisher, speaking to Lon-
don Student, commented: “To re-
ceive money from companies that
are responsible for killing innocent
civilians and prolonging conflict
across the world is unacceptable
for a university that prides itself
as a pioneer of research into social
justice, human rights and the de-
velopment of peaceful international
relations.”
This opposition to London uni-
versities holding shares in arms
companies was not confined to
King’s College; SOAS, the School
for African and Oriental Studies,
sold its shares after CAAT’s report
of 2005 mobilised student opinion
against the practice. Goldsmith’s
College has moved away from its
fund manager, CCLA, which held
arms shares, in order to move to an
ethical investment policy. Imperial
College does not currently have an
ethical investment policy, and as
yet no plans have been announced
to adopt one.
