Falke Wool Tights
Or if paying £19 for a
pair of tights makes
you choke, Levante for
£5.95. If you decide to
go for style rather than
being sane and wearing
trousers, then go for wool
tights to wear with winter
skirts/shorts. Wearing
sheer tights is just trashy.
Wool Coats
A wool coat is the best
outerwear for the anti-
boho look. Those disgust-
ing parkas will probably
keep you warmer than
cheaply made, thinly
lined, high street wool
coats. Don’t get anything
less than 80% wool.
FCUK
FCUK has delusions of
being in some sort of
stratosphere between
high-street and designer.
Apparently this means
they can charge £150
for a dress. If you want a
pretty dress, go to Oxford
Street Topshop, there’s
a great selection under
£150.
Roland Mouret for Gap
His collection for Gap
looks surprisingly shit,
even on Lily Cole. Not
that will stop fashionistas
blindly buying it anyway,
thinking it gives them
some sort of fashion ku-
dos. Just because people
bought the Galaxy dress,
does not mean every-
thing he creates is gold.
Shoes That Seem To Be
Made Of Foil
Available from Office for
£39.99. For when you
need to protect your feet
from Alien mind control
rays. If you see someone
wearing these, you can
be sure they suffer from
mental problems. Most
probably schizophrenia.
Ode to the old humble Tee

Nowadays the T-shirt is a basic in
most people's wardrobe, although it
started off as strictly an item of un-
derwear. Much in the way the vest
became the vest top; perhaps in the
future, people will walk around in
just bras. Although probably only
women, not men walking around in
bras. Though the morbidly obese
would be a special case. There’s
nothing worse than droopy man
boobs.
The modern T-shirt was devel-
oped by Jockey International as
inexpensive athletic wear for the
University of Southern California
football team. T-shirts have gone
the same way as trainers, from
athletic wear to being worn mainly
as leisure wear. When the univer-
sity started stencilling “Property Of
USC” to stop other students steal-
ing the football team’s T-shirts,
they ironically became even more
popular.
The T-shirt was also popularised
by the media coverage of WWII,
showing soldiers in their standard
issue T-shirts. The iconic image of
James Dean in a white T-shirt in
Rebel Without a Cause, spawned
a wave of teenagers trying to emu-
late his style.
From the controversial, T-shirts
are now accepted as mundane.
There are thousands of T-shirt
brands, and every big label has a T-
shirt with it's logo plastered across
the front. It's the ultimate high-
margin good for labels. Cheap to
make, and a price easily marked up
to absurd levels just for printing a
brand across the front.
Although, there is something
quite democratic about T-shirts.
They can be bought from anywhere
by everyone, and can easily be
printed with anything. Some use T-
shirts to express their personality,
or to substitute for. Or to show sup-
port for political beliefs. Who hasn't
owned a Che T-shirt at some point
in their life? T-shirts can say a lot
about people's beliefs or self image.
I'm not saying you can judge peo-
ple by what their T-shirt. However
you can make wildly exaggerated
comments that generally prove
shockingly accurate. Here is a se-
lection of widely worn T-shirts, and
wholly unbiased description of it's
typical wearer.
Felix Fashion's top five T-shirts. In stores now
The Band Tee
A huge fan of The Sex Pistols/The
Pixies/The Clash, despite the fact
they are now dead/octogenarians.
Thinks wearing an allegiance to
them on his T-shirt is in some way
original. The Clash? Who are they?
Oh wait, I think they were men-
tioned in Bring It On.
The D&G Branded Tee
Thinks wearing D&G across his
chest is some sort of sartorially
suave statement. Also thinks ex-
pensive trainers are the epitome
of style. Wears too much gel in his
hair. Thinks Chinawhites is a good
night out. Will die alone.
The Nerdy Internet Purchased Tee
Quite funny in a sarcastic way.
Self-involved and slightly neurotic.
Owns too many DVDs. Knew War
Of Warcraft intimately, before it
was featured on South Park.
The Generic “Urban” Tee
Chav. Also falling into the category:
Nike T-shirts. Why can't you just go
to a nice charity shop and get one?
The Nathan Barley-esque Tee
Sees his T-shirt as symbolic of his
superior cultural nous. Reads I-D.
Owns skinny-jeans which are ei-
ther unflattering on his fat thighs
or perfect on his drug-emaciated
frame. Probably owns a guitar that
he doesn’t know how to play.
The Vintage Tee
Thinks he is above such things as
fashion. Aiming for understated
cool. Ironically, hunting through a
vintage store for a T-shirt that isn’t
sweat-stained or reek of sweat is al-
most the direct opposite of this.
