Drugs scandal
“Corporate scandal is not hard
to come by in the media and the
pharmaceutical industry certainly
takes its fair share of the limelight.
How ethical is it for companies at
the very core of public health to be
driven by their share-holders, prof-
iting from sickness?”

“There’s something in the Tomb

Council swayed by award
On Tuesday, Union Council voted
22-6, with 12 abstentions, to award
ex-Felix Editor, Rupert Neate, hon-
orary life membership of the Union.
Mr. Neate was denied this member-
ship, often granted to any sabb that
doesn’t disgrace themselves during
their term, at the end of last year by
the previous Union Council.
The proposal to give Mr. Neate
life membership was put forward
by long-time Felix contributor,
Stephen Brown, on the back of Mr.
Neate’s success at the Guardian
Student Media Awards, where he
won ‘Journalist of the Year’. Felix
was also named ‘Student Newspa-
per of the Year’.
The paper argued that the deci-
sion taken not to award life mem-
bership last year had been “petty,
vindictive, and reflected poorly on
ICU Council,” and that “this deci-
sion sets an alarming precedent
as it compromises Felix’s editorial
independence if awards are seen
to be linked to how ‘nice’ you are to
The much-maligned ex-Felix Editor, Rupert Neate, has been granted life membership of
the Union after winning Journalist of the Year at the Guardian Student Media Awards
Mr. Arif, when contacted by Live!,
said that he did no such thing, and
that Mr. Matthews’ interpretation is
“very creative”.
The precedent that Mr. Matthews
is referring to is likely to be the im-
pounding of Felix during the sabb
elections three years ago. In that
case, one candidate had placed an
advert in the paper, and the other
candidates complained. The sabbs
then impounded the paper, going as
far as to tear it from people’s hands.
After a confrontation with a rather
angry Alex Coby, Felix Editor at
the time, who declared the action
“absolutely outrageous, completely
out of order and quite possibly il-
legal,” the newspaper was swiftly
re-released. When questioned by
this reporter, Mr. Matthews stated
that he was well aware of this prec-
edent, but that this was an entirely
separate situation.
He confirmed that he had been
approached by the ‘Yes’ campaign
with concerns over conspiracy in
the ranks of the ‘No’ campaign;
Guildsheet is the CGCU newspaper,
and the leader of the ‘No’ campaign
is the CGCU President, James Fok.
Additionally, the publication shares
an office with Mr. Fok. Mr. Matthews
also commented on the fact that
Guildsheet had no set publication
date, and that he’d heard the paper
was “rushed to completion”.
Ashley Brown, editor of Live!,
refuted these accusations: “Guild-
sheet comes out monthly, and has
done for years. The papers were
supposed to be delivered on Satur-
day [a month since the last issue],
but a technical failure at the print-
ers meant they were delivered on
Tuesday.” He also stated that there
is very little contact between Mr.
Fok and the editor of Guildsheet,
as “all of the editing on Guildsheet
is done within the editor’s Beit Hall
room,” and that he rarely if ever en-
ters the CGCU office.
Mr. Matthews has said that
Guildsheet will be released on Fri-
day, once the referendum result
is announced. Whether that will
be enough to save this somewhat
farcical referendum remains to be
seen.
NUS farce
continues
Union officers.”
As could be expected with any
Council debate involving Mr. Neate,
the debate became rather furious.
Many present had been treated
badly by Mr. Neate or Felix at some
point, and were loathe to let this pa-
per pass.
Various amendments to the pa-
per were proposed, mainly striking
the sections that criticised Coun-
cil. John Collins, Union President,
said: “We have to think carefully
before making this Union policy if
it contains this kind of criticism.”
He proposed striking all the points
that criticised Council, as “the end
result would be the same anyway.”
Mr. Brown put up a passionate fight
to try to save the measures, but
Council voted to strike them.
In the end, after almost half an
hour of debate, Council finally
moved to a vote and passed the pa-
per with a sizeable majority, to the
obvious disdain of some of those
present. The award, now safely ensconced within the confines of the Felix office
New Southside twin rooms ‘too small’
The double rooms in Southside
are “too small,” according to a re-
port submitted to Council by Ben
‘Fluffy’ Harris, Deputy President
(Education & Welfare).
Up until now, the project has been
running well; almost suspiciously
well for a College building project. It
has come in on budget, on time and
has been so successful that College
are considering plans to demol-
ish and rebuild Eastside (Linstead
Halls) and rebuild it in the same
fashion, using off-site fabrication
techniques to reduce noise on-site.
A number of dignitaries from the
Union, including Felix, were invited
to go see the official “topping out”
ceremony.
In a report to Council, Mr. Fluffy
revealed that the twin rooms in
Southside were too small for their
original purpose, and the College
is likely to convert them to single
rooms.
The Rector initially applauded
Southside’s design, as it has more
rooms than the monstrosity that
preceded it, but the possibility of
the twins being converted to dou-
bles seems likely to reduce this
benefit. The new building contains
roughly an equal number of twins
and singles.
The Eastside plans have been
modified to correct this error, ac-
cording to Mr. Harris.
