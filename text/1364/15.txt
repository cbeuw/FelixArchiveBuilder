worship and perhaps the most re-
nowned and powerful image of this
deity is ‘Shiva as Natara-
ja’ or Lord of the
dance.
In the cen-
tre of a
fiery
circle
stands
Shiva, his
nubile frame
twists to the end-
less dance of time,
and as he beats a
drum of creation
and holds forth
a flame of destruction, he smiles
knowingly perhaps as he holds the
secrets of the uni-
verse. This
was in
my
opin-
ion
the most
impres-
sive piece of the
exhibition.
Another lovely
piece is that of
the ‘Krishna danc-
ing on Kaliya,’ this playful piece
depicts a triumphant Krishna who
has tamed the demon Kaliya. This
strange creature has a long serpent
tail but from the waist up resem-
bles a child, Krishna holds the tail
up proudly and the subdued demon
smiles placidly from underneath
Krishna’s feet. This piece was my
favourite representation of Vishnu.
Part of sacred worship of all
deities is acknowledgement and
appreciation of the highly sex-
ual image of The Divine. The
Chola images rejoice in the
physical beauty of the body
and of nature, and embrace
sexuality. ‘Uma as Durga’
is a highly sensual piece
where the Goddess stands
proudly half-naked dis-
playing her full voluptuous
figure.
Like other Chola pieces
the inspiration came from
the raw power and beauty
of nature. As the exhibi-
tion curator describes ‘her
thighs are shown to be as
sturdy as banana stalks,
her arms as flexible as bam-
boo, and her lips should
have the fullness of a ripe
mango fruit.’
These exquisite bronzes were
and still are the inspiration for
sacred worship, devout faith and
expression of sexuality. With Greek
mythology being such an influence
in western painting it was refresh-
ing to be inspired by something
different. Multiple arms drew me
in, and I would recommend spicing
up your gallery visit with some hot
Chola bronzes!

In anticipation of the 60th anniver-
sary of Indian Independence the
Royal Academy of Art is holding an
exhibition of some of the finest In-
dian sculptural art ever made.
These world-renowned Chola
bronzes were produced by the
prominent Chola dynasty that
ruled the South Indian ter-
ritory of Tamil Nadu from
the 9th to the 13th century.
These bronzes depict the sa-
cred Hindu deities and their
saints and were used for sa-
cred worship.
The Chola dynasty revolu-
tionised the deity image and
duetothelost-waxtechnique
each bronze is totally unique.
For the first time ever deities
were carried out of the tem-
ple, the bronzes representing
a wave of devout Hinduism
which swept India at the time
and showing the development of
a new artistic expression.
Hinduism was described by the
curator of this exhibition, Profes-
sor Dehijia, as a ‘diamond with
many facets,’ as each facet is repre-
sented by a different deity. Indeed
multiplicity is very important in the
Hindu religion and deities depicted
by the Chola bronzes fulfil a multi-
tude of roles from demon slaying
to child-rearing. In fact their char-
acteristic multiple arms represent
their ability to carry out many dif-
ferent tasks.

Shiva as Nataraja
This comedy can only be described
as a virtuoso performance by the
two actors Hugh Lee and Simon
Delaney. They start by playing the
main characters, local Irish lads
Jake Quinn and Charlie Conlon and
go on to play thirteen other charac-
ters, revolving throughout the play.
The plot: a major Hollywood stu-
dio descends on rural Co. Kerry,
Ireland to make a film. The locals
are employed as extras get paid a
good £40 for a day’s filming.
Through the presence of the film
company filming in the village, we
see Jake and Charlie’s desires,
hopes and fears unroll. The tragic
death of one of Jake’s family mem-
bers Sean, gives the play its name.
Throughout the play, Charlie has
a dream to write and produce a
script, and despite his recent fail-
ures eventually transcribes a story
about him and Jake, two extras in a
film trying to make it big.
The transition from one character
to the next is seamless: body pos-
ture, facial expressions and voice
are all timed to perfection. Lee and
Delaney are hilarious as they hold
the stage for nearly two hours.
Especially funny and well acted is
the assistant director Ashley, who
can only be described as juvenile,
extremely pushy and pouting. The
energy of the two actors never fal-
ters, the greatest moment being
when they perform an Irish dance.
The play is somewhat confusing
at the start, but once you get your
head around the character chang-
es, it is highly entertaining. Witty
jokes and phrases, attempted Irish
accents and mild swearing make
this production a joy to watch.

Mamma Mia! It is not quite what you’d expect
I’m not an ABBA fan. I’m also not,
in general, a fan of musicals, ex-
cept those from before about 1940,
and even then I don’t like many. So
it was with some foreboding that I
agreed to review Mamma Mia! the
1990s musical constructed around
the ABBA back catalogue.
IfyouloveABBA,youcan’tgowrong
with this show. It includes practi-
cally every hit (except Fernando,
according to a disgruntled woman
in the rowbehind me), plus some of
their more exciting costumes, and
piles of their cheesiness.
Written by Benny Andersson and
Björn Ulvaeus (the brains behind
ABBA), the musical follows the sto-
ry of a Sophie, daughter of Greek
taverna owner and ex-club singer
Donna, as she is about to be mar-
ried. Sophie doesn’t know who her
father is, and Donna won’t tell her,
so Sophie steals her diaries and us-
ing some basic maths narrows the
field down to three.
Without telling her mother, So-
phie invites the three men to her
wedding, assuming she will be able
to recognise her father.
We warn patrons of a nervous disposition that platform boots and white lycra feature in this production
Unfortunately for Sophie, this
doesn’t happen, and when all three
guess what has happened and
agree to walk her down the aisle,
Sophie is forced to tell her mother
what she did.
Pretty unadventurous stuff, and
this production could easily have
leant on the fact that it sings ABBA
in order to sell tickets, but it doesn’t.
Despite the young leads (Sophie
and her fiancé Sky) being practical-
ly completely one-dimensional, the
show entertains throughout thanks
to the older cast of Donna’s friends
and exes.
Particularly noteworthy were
Tanya (played by the understudy)
the gold-digging divorcée, and Bill
(also the understudy), the eccentric
jungle explorer.
Comic highlights came when Bill
was serenaded by Rosie (Joanna
Monro) with Take a Chance on Me,
and the high-kicks of Sky’s friends
whilst wearing flippers. I also en-
joyed the production’s penchant for
eye-catching codpieces.
Despite some very tenuous links
into songs and an annoyingly soppy
ending, I really did enjoy this pro-
duction. It doesn’t make the mis-
take of taking itself seriously, and I
laughed all the way through.
