Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
If you enjoy the horo-
scopes, and would like
to see a collection of
the most disturbing
ones from this term
published in the last
issue, then please send an email
to felix@imperial.ac.uk with the
subject: “I have not smoked any
crack whatsoever today.”
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
You’re a miserable
hippie fuck and you
smell like unwashed
khakis. Today, you
and your friends try to
break into a McDon-
ald’s to daub paint all over the
counter, to signify, like, how bad
they are to, like, the world. Dude.
You are too stoned to go outside.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
This week you get
blu-tac stuck over
your Jap’s eye after a
rather daring ex-
periment goes badly
wrong. Luckily for
you though, the nurse tending to
your needs does just that and then
some. You jet off to St. Lucia and
live a life of luxury and coconuts.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
You had a virgin-
ity race with the kids
from your high school,
and you lost. That
cute little Gemma just
wasn’t ready to go
“all the way,” and now you’re to be
sacrificed to satisfy the town’s lust
for blood. They say it tastes better
than normal blood.
This Week’s Sniperscopes
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
You have two penises,
but you use both of
them for evil. You
wave your wangers at
passing grannies with
gay abandon, which
earns you the attention of the Lon-
don Constabulary. They arrange
for you to fall down the station
steps several times.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
Shock horror! Sitting
in a Starbucks read-
ing Proust will not get
you any ass. If I see
your stupid goatee-
adorned face in my
hood again, I’ll quote Heidegger at
you until your temporal lobe melts
and you’re forced to spend the rest
of your days licking a doorknob.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
You realise that the
phrase “fucking
hell, I’ve got some
jaffa cakes in my coat
pocket” is actually the
most true thing that
has yet been said, and dwarfs the
sum total of mankind’s achieve-
ments like a mountain dwarfs a..
dwarf. You are really high.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
You break up a bar
fight today. One of the
participants is a beau-
tiful, young American
girl with long purple
hair. You fall instantly
in love, and have two smart, funny,
intelligent children, and live hap-
pily ever after in the suburbs. I just
wanted to be positive for once.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
Alexander Antonov
actually invented
lorem ipsum dontcha
know. It’s postulated
by some pompous
prick that he came
up with the text whilst curling one
out on the crapper, but actually he
invented it whilst riding his penny
farthing on Brighton Pier.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
This week on tales of
the Bearded Intruder:
the BI realises his
name is a disgusting
euphemism for penis,
and flees in shame.
Back at Horoscope HQ, we laugh
and clink martini glasses in cel-
ebration. How long will the peace
hold? Tune in next week to find out.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
Tomo’s friends: I know
you read these. You
have to guess which
one are the venerable
editor’s, and which are
scrawled by that pre-
tender to the throne of Felix, Lord
Roberts. Incidentally, if I meet you,
I’ll have to fuck you up. It’s in the
constitution, motherfuckers.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
You are endlessly
amused by the word
“jocular”. However,
you keep using the
word ‘irony’ incorrect-
ly, thus earning the
ire of those around you. You meet
a blind man who has no shoes, and
he tells you to fuck off. This has
been a non-sequitur horoscope.
