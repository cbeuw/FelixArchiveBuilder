Britain loses students to US
Last week, Princeton University
reported a 65 per cent rise in ap-
plications over the past year from
British students. Janet Rapelye,
the Dean of admissions, said num-
bers were expected to grow further
as Britain’s top-up fees meant that
students could obtain better finan-
cial support from a US university
than from one in the UK.
Thisannouncementhasprompted
fears that young people are becom-
ing increasingly disenchanted with
British universities after the intro-
duction of top up fees. Ivy League
institutions are increasingly tar-
geting British schools as they look
to boost their international intake.
Around 8,400 British students are
studying at US universities, two-
thirds as undergraduates.
Janet Rapelye told a conference
at the £24,000-a-year Wellington
College in Berkshire, that 100 Brit-
ish youngsters applied to Princeton
this year, compared to 61 last year.
Ms Rapelye said the benefits of US
universities were “overwhelming”
with better teaching, facilities, ac-
commodation and extra-curricular
activities. In addition, she stated
that the financial support available
from the top US institutions such as
Princeton, Yale and Harvard were
second to none. Anthony Seldon,
master of Wellington, who organ-
ized the conference on UK students
studying at US universities, said:
“British schools are beginning to
lose faith in UK universities. Unfa-
miliarity is no excuse for dismissing
the option of a US university educa-
tion. I encourage all my pupils to
consider US universities alongside
UK ones. It does take determination
and courage to break away from
the crowd but British students are
as able as those from any other na-
tion.” This represents a dangerous
trend for academic life in the UK
and is eroding the idea of the UK
being a haven for the world’s stu-
dents. With the introduction of top-
up fees, average student debt has
reached £13,000 a year. However,
most students are actually leaving
university with debt of over £22,000.
Comparing the costs of studying
at Princeton relative to the UK, an
undergraduate in the US would be
billed £24 000.. A vast array of extra
curricular activities are available
in the US from interstate baseball
competitions, football and even
cheerleading tournaments. Princ-
eton also offers childcare facilities
and disability services, has one of
the best campus universities in the
world and collections include more
than 6.2 million books, and holdings
of rare books, prints and archives.
A UK education will cost £1500 a
year in tuition fees. Added to this
is the cost of accommodation, liv-
ing materials and (perhaps) the
odd night on the town This can take
the costs of studying anything up
to £8000 a year, resulting in total
debts after graduation being be-
tween £20,000 to £30,000. The NUS
has been campaigning for the abol-
ishment of tuition fees due to their
effects at deterring students from
higher education. At their recent
demonstration on the 29th October
NUS president Gemma Tumelty
said: “We really believe that debt
will be a huge deterrent on students
entering education. This year there
were 15,000 fewer students - that’s
a huge concern to us, particularly
when government is trying to wid-
en participation.”
With increasing demand to in-
crease resources available for
students in higher education in-
stitutions it appears unlikely that
tensions will resolve in the near
future.

Politics Editor
A warm welcome back to you
all from a resurrected Felix
Politics! Yes, you thought that
we all died and were to spend an
eternity banished from the Felix
underworld office, but we’re
back! And before you know it,
we have a new mystery writer.
Old man Warsaw will be keeping
you up to date with his (slightly
warped) view of the world. How-
ever, I don’t think that anyone
will have too many objections to
this week’s view - no one really
likes Saddam, no one really likes
the Republicans!
What will be interesting to
note is the link that a change in
strategy in US Foreign Policy
will make to the so called “global
war against terror.” Will this give
hope to those who have seen the
current foreign policy fail miser-
ably, or will it feed into the “ideo-
logical war.?” What even is this
war? And how are we going to
react when searching for terror
suspects with such a high level
of paranoia? Thankfully, Imperial
has a habit of being cool-headed.
Student fees are an everlast-
ing problem. Its not surprising
people will use their money else-
where when they find a better
deal. But, I don’t care how we do
it, students need to have bet-
ter resources. If we are to face
higher fees or to look at other
factors, then we have to make
the hard decisions. Education is
more than just a monetary asset,
but idealic priciples calling for
no fees at all, devoid of all reality,
simply cannot work in today’s
climate.
Welcome
Warsaw’s week
Justice. Go on; say it again, in front
of the mirror, whilst you’re shav-
ing. It’s a lovely word isn’t it? We
all love it when justice gets done;
just the last week the politicians of
Capitol Hill celebrated when they
passed sentence (and by ‘they’ I
obviously mean Iraqi judges, no
ambiguity intended, oh no) on
Saddam Hussein, putting this evil
scum-bag to death and ending the
era of lawlessness in Iraq. I think.
Anyway, justice leaves you warm
and fuzzy inside, doesn’t it? (Well,
not for Saddam, he’ll be dead. But
that’s by the bye.)
At least there was one genuine
case of justice being done last week
in the US mid-term elections. No,
don’t turn over; I know I read the
Guardian and hence I’m incredibly
bitter about the whole world, but
that doesn’t mean that this column
will descend into another “George
Bush is an eejid” piece. Anyway a
bit of politics on Friday will make
you sleep better. And not because
it’s boring.
Last week the Democrats won a
landslide vote which helped them
win a majority in the US Senate.
The seat which tipped the balance
here was Virginia, previously held
by Republican George Allen, with a
strong majority.
So what went wrong? Whilst on
the campaign trail, George Al-
len turned to a man videoing his
speech and suddenly referenced
him: “This feller over here in the
yellow shirt, Macaca or whatev-
er his name is…” and asked the
crowd to give a “Warm welcome to
Macaca here”.
After the initial confusion and
speculation over whether he was
hitting the crack-pipe at all, it was
then pointed out that the person he
was referring to, Mr. S.R. Sidarth,
was of Indian descent, and Macaca
is an obscure racial slur, as it
equates people to monkeys of the
Macaca genus. Oops.
Mr. Allen tried to apologise af-
terwards, but matters were not
helped when it came out that he
has a history of showing off the
Confederate flag; by wearing it as
a pin badge and putting it up in his
living room, and when recounting
the Civil War he did not mention
(never mind denounce) slavery at
all. Double Oops.
This incident caused Mr. Allen
to lose his majority on the area,
and he lost his seat (and thus the
Republican hold on the Senate) by
7,000 votes. Not only that but with
this incident marring his political
career there’s little chance of him
successfully standing as the Re-
publican presidential candidate for
the 2008 election. Big oops.
Southern-fried justice; tasty. Bet-
ter still, history has shown us that
there’s no chance that a politician
with a history of racial insensitiv-
ity forming his own splinter party
to gain power, is there, Robert Kil-
roy-Silk? My oops.

MI5 intelligence discussion
Last week the Director General of
the MI5, Dame Eliza Manningham-
Buller, gave a speech at Queen
Mary College, London in which she
warned of the continuing threat of
terrorism to Great Britain and de-
scribed how the Security Service
agencies were combating it.
Pointing out that the current
threat began well before 9/11,
Dame Eliza cited a range of factors
that were motivating acts of terror-
ism, such as perceived injustices
against Muslims around the world,
extreme interpretations of Islam
and aspects of UK foreign policy.
Dame Eliza noted that the threat
has increased steadily since 9/11
and currently the Security Service
and police were aware of dozens of
plots to kill people and damage the
British economy, with 200 networks
and over 1,600 individuals currently
under investigation.
She was addressing an invited au-
dience of academics, students and
journalists as a guest of Professor
Peter Hennessy. The Group is an
arm of the Mile End Institute for
the Study of British Government,
Intelligence and Society.
The Security Service is currently
expanding to meet the threat, but
Dame Eliza warned that even when
it reaches its projected target of
3,500 staff by 2008, it would not be
able to prevent every terror attack.
During her speech, Dame Eliza
elaborated on classical objections
to such reports that simply “stir up
fear”. Although other threats such
as climate change and road acci-
dents may appear to be more harm-
ful to the country at present, she
put forward the view that another
terrorist attack would be disastrous
for the global, economy.
This news couples along with oth-
er reports that Islamic extremists
have infiltrated at least four Brit-
ish universities in order to radical-
ise Muslim students. According to
Sheikh Musa Admani, Brunel Uni-
versity in west London, Bedford-
shire University, Luton, Sheffield
Hallam University and Manchester
Metropolitan University have all
been infiltrated by radical elements
that host events and lectures with
external speakers which allegedly
bring other Muslims towards more
extreme outlooks.

Dame evaluates Islam and the role of the security services
However, a study for the Joseph
Rowntree Reform Trust said min-
isters must stop using “misleading
and disproportionate” language on
terrorism, which “allows terrorists
to assume the dignity of being sol-
diers or combatants instead of the
criminals that they are”.
It says the only way of success-
fully tackling terrorism is to win the
trust and cooperation of Muslim
communities in the UK, in particu-
lar those young people who provide
the tacit support that allows terror-
ism to survive.
There has been much speculation
about what motivates young men
and women to carry out acts of ter-
rorism in the UK. Muslim groups,
such as the Muslim Council of Brit-
ain, have previously voiced their
concern that the Government has
not recognised the link between
foreign policy in the Muslim world
causing widespread and deep frus-
tration in Muslims in Britain.
A press release on the 18th Au-
gust 2006 stated that “it cannot be
said enough that there can never
be any justification for the deliber-
ate killing of civilians. However, the
Government needs to acknowledge
that extremist groups have taken
advantage of Britain’s role in the
wars against Afghanistan and Iraq
and Washington’s longstanding
blind support for Israel as an oppor-
tunity to recruit more Muslims”.
