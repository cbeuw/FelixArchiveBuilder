Spartacus who? I am Bob more like
O
h dear. The voices in
my ear have just an-
nounced that Brian’s
teeth have been put
in the bin. Six hun-
dred quid I’m told. Six hundred! I
wonder how much Goldie paid to
have his iconic jaw lined with shiny
pegs. That’s by the by anyway,
we’re shooting immediately! We
need those teeth!
“Tom to Patrick, can we confirm
that the teeth have been binned and
bagged?” I’ve been Jack Bauer-
ed up; collar microphone, twisted
telephone cord earpiece and all.
My static-ridden earphone comes
to life: “This is Patrick. Yeah, we
can’t find the black sack on set. It
must’ve been taken to the trailers.”
Dear, oh dear. Patrick finishes: “the
teeth are wrapped in some white
tissue paper.”
We’ve been black bagging waste
for the previous three days, not for-
getting the working men’s club as
well. Even more unfortunate, the
grubbily soiled fluorescent bin men
said they’d come back tomorrow
since the car park was brim to ca-
pacity. Three trailers worth of beer
bottles, stale ale, cigarette stubs,
saturated tea bags, and rotting food
from over-indulgent people with
eyes too big for their bellies are
over spilling. Glitzy and glamorous
colourful wasps have begun intrud-
ing on the flies’ old stomping and
vomiting grounds. They’re here for
the short haul, probably until the
next filming location is discovered.
I manage to identify the most re-
cently dumped bags easily enough.
Opening the sacks is less straight-
forward. There isn’t time to faff
about though; people are likely on
the end of a verbal battering from
the fiery Irish assistant director.
Probably runners. Stupidly I don’t
have any gloves. Ripping the sacks
open appeals to the destructive na-
ture in me, but the satisfaction is
soon washed away by the stagnant
coffee and fag ash confetti caking
my hands.
Cracked polystyrene cups tumble
across the car park whilst used ser-
viettes flutter in the air like bacteria
ridden pollen. The contents of three
or four sacks lay strewn in front of
the trailers. Several more will need
re-bagging. Standing with grimy
arms at my side, moist fingers out-
stretched and separated, there is no
sign of the tissue cocoon. A delivery
man strides past curling his nose
up. Following him from round the
corner, Patrick appears. He quick-
ens towards me, glancing over the
mess: “Oh mate, the teeth were in
the bin on stage all along.”
I
t was the last day of August
when I got the call. I was lying
in bed back at home in sleepy
Suffolk, stroking my beautiful
white cat Pauline and watch-
ing Extras, funnily enough, when
my mum pushed the door open and
thrust the telephone in front of my
face with a puzzled look on her face.
“Hello?” I curiously inquired. “Hi
Tom, this is…” I’m terrible for re-
membering people’s names when
they introduce themselves over the
phone. “I’m location manager for
Clockwork Pictures. I believe you
sent us your CV.” He was probably
correct, but I didn’t actually know
which company was which since I’d
blanket bombed so many different
companies with my life summary.
“We’re filming a short film next
week called ‘I Am Bob’ starring
Bob Geldof and I was wondering
whether you’d like to be a runner
for us?” I was taken aback. My
stomach was doing my brain’s work
for it – digesting all the information,
whilst trying to figure out who’d ac-
tually given me this invitation to the
cinematic kitchen. Brain engaged, I
willingly accepted. “OK, John I’ll
see you on Monday”. The voice on
the end of the phone corrected me:
“It’s Jean, like the French for John
– J. E. A. N.”
I actually started on Saturday,
two days after the phone conversa-
tion. Now residing in Earl’s Court,
Jean asked if I could help out set-
ting up before the main shoot be-
gan on Monday. I made my way
to Hammersmith Working Men’s
Club. Jean met me outside the en-
trance to the car park of the club.
Dressed in surfer branded casual
gear, with shades and a half base-
ball-half army officer flat cap, we
shook hands and he walked me to
location. His wispy blonde beard
and tall beanpole stature led me to
believe he was a pirate.
The location was dilapidated to
say the least. The car park’s black
gate was rusted, dried paint shards
flaking from jutting spears with no
possibility of swinging shut ever
again. Faint parking bay lines boxed
in rust bucket Fiestas and plumb-
ers’ small car derived vans. Weeds
struggled through tarmac cracks
and the red brickwork crumbled
easily. A large marquee was being
constructed as a base behind the
scenes alongside an area for make-
up, wardrobe, and catering lorries.
Jean led me to the main dancehall
of the club. Having read the script a
few nights beforehand, I could im-
mediately feel the short film being
played out. Bob Geldof becomes
stranded at a small motel without a
penny or mobile phone. He sets out
to find some way of getting to Glas-
gow where he’s required for a Make
Poverty History gig.
Inside the hall was a huge empty
faux-wooden floor, surrounded by
small seating bays lay in front of
a big stage. The stage instantly
brought to mind The Full Monty
complete with a tacky shimmering
backdrop of long gold, silver, and
magenta ribbons. Each bay housed
a sturdy oak table, a dusty burgun-
dy patterned seating row and blue
waiting room chairs; the latter of
which were clearly a new addition
in such a nostalgic dancehall. There
was even a solitary disco ball in the
centre of the ceiling, completely
dwarfed by the scale of everything
else. Immediate thoughts conjured
up images of senior ballroom class-
es or Punch & Judy shows on stage,
playing to children in the audience
whilst parents breast fed their tod-
dlers in the bays, twittering about
how Big Steve will be released from
prison in six months.
I woke up at 6am on Monday and
made my way to the location. So far,
I’d met the director, Donald, a very
serene and placid character >>
