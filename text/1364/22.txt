Lara Croft, Countess of Abingdon,
is a bit of a grey area when it comes
to character branding. Now Mario,
Mario is one of those universal
characters. Everyone loves Mario,
like that bumbling uncle or strange
lecturer that, whilst you don’t al-
ways understand them, are never
anything less than adorable.
The problem with Lara is that
she’s changed so much over the
last decade that, at some point
in the past, the chances are you
couldn’t stand her. But, by the same
token, there’s something in the
Tomb Raider franchise that keeps
Lara floating at the top of the Pop
Culture sea, and has done since her
inception way back in 1996.
And yes, okay, it’s the titties.
Ten years, two movies, and seven
games, though, is no mean feat for
a woman that, despite not exist-
ing (sorry, chaps), has had quite a
fraught history.

ing informed them that Americans

on; to the point of firing the fourth
model to play Lara after she posed
nude in a Playboy shoot, as well as
shutting down the notorious Nud-
eRaider.com website; her original
creator, Toby Gard, left Core De-
sign shortly after the release of the
first game, unhappy with the way
Lara was being portrayed.
“She confounds all the sexist cli-
chés” he told The Face shortly after
the games release, but admitted
that marketing realised the most
obvious way to promote the game.
After reaching a high point with
The Last Revelation, the series
went into a decline, and even an
attempt to rejuvenate the game
on the Playstation 2 fell somewhat
short. The latest release however -
Tomb Raider: Legend - sees the re-
turn of Toby Gard to the franchise,
even if only in an advisory role.
And the critical response did im-
prove. Mario, Sonic, Crash Bandi-
coot - they have a particular image,
partly helped by being open to chil-
dren - that can’t be shattered by the
quality of the games they feature in.
But the challenge of keeping a more
adult brand alive is that adults are
generally much more easily turned
off.
Lara’s tenth birthday is a remark-
able milestone for a woman who
simultaneously represents gam-
ing’s most mature and immature
moments from the last few genera-
tions of console. Whether she out-

birthday, mi’lady.

Duke Nukem, the Quake marine
and butch Raccoon City cops. The
guns were still there, and so were
the goons. But the player was sud-
denly in less familiar territory. For
one thing, they had really tight
shorts on.
Was it pandering to the lady-de-
prived gamer stereotype? Lara’s

ous stages of exploitation over the
years. Although Eidos frequently

Does a games console ever re-
ally “die”? Traditionally speaking,
previous generation consoles have
a remarkably positive history for
staying alive when succeeded by
their newer brothers and sisters.
Indeed, one can walk into most
high-street video game outlets and
still purchase original Playstation
titles and consoles - the pre-owned
market allows extended life to the
obsolete hardware in some senses,
but when does a console fade into
history and become a relic? When
the manufacturer stops producing
units? When the developers stop
making games?
The consumer and producer’s
view of when a console is dead dif-
fer vastly. To Sony, for example, it
seems clear cut. When they stop
receiving license fees from game
publishers and their big Playstation
factories cease emitting smoke,
that console is gone. To some con-
sumers, it’s only just begun. Late
adopters can pick up pre-owned
or discontinued stock for pocket
change, and start out on the adven-
tures many took up years ago, at a
fraction of the cost. This is, how-
ever, a repeat process. Eventually
these people will be in possession
of even newer consoles, which play
the older games, and then - surely
- those older consoles must be ob-
solete, useless? Perhaps not in the
case of the Microsoft Xbox. The
Xbox’s genius is in its simplicity:
it’s a PC. In a box. As such, very
clever EULA-breaking people have
figured out ways to make it do other
things beside play games. At home,
I can stream media over my net-
work directly onto the Xbox and
then onto my very cheap telly. My
friend can access his over the Inter-
net at work. Some people even use
them as web servers. Why not?
The same cannot be said for the
Playstation 2, which is - at best - a
very expensive DVD player. When
the world’s richest buy their new
Sony toy on launch day, they’re not
going to keep their number twos
on standby - not when the newer
consoles are backwards-compat-
ible. The same is not true for the
Xbox - when, or if, I buy one of Mi-
crosoft’s newer consoles, the Xbox
won’t end up in the attic or on eBay.
It’ll be hooked up to an older TV in
another room in the house. As far
as I’m concerned, it fills the roll of
a piece of hardware several times
its cost. It won’t die until it does
literally. And then I’ll probably buy
another, at a fraction of a fraction of
the original cost.
Increasingly, we’re seeing the
recycling of older hardware for
newer purposes. Old PCs in the
boots of cars hooked up to tiny TFT
screens. Hand-held consoles being
used as controllers and peripher-
als for their bigger brothers (a la
Gamecube & Gameboy Advance).
Consoles reaching outside their
remit of playing video games will
be an important factor in future en-
deavours in the market.
Indeed, a sizeable slice of the
Xbox pie is made up of people who
wish to do more advanced opera-
tions - why buy a consoles and a
media centre?
With the increased interest in
multiple-use machines, in order to
retain customers and effectively
fight Microsoft’s offering, Sony and
to some extent, Nintendo, must up
their games - and do more than just
put faster graphics processors in
bigger, blacker consoles.
Killing is one of those things that
never gets old, and this week there
are a few new methods of killing
that are worth looking into. The
first - Gears Of War - is a co-op-
erative killing spree dressed up in
the shiny Unreal 3 engine. The AI
is an improvement on the last gen-
eration, but you’ll find the entire
experience a lot more fun if you’ve
got some humans playing with you -
either through the LIVE online sys-
tem, or within punching distance in
the room.
But guns are boring unless you’re
wearing a cape, so Final Fantasy
fans will be pleased (unless you’re a
purist) to know that Vincent Valen-
tine is returning this week in Dirge
Of Cerberus; an enjoyable - if con-
fusing - romp exploring Vince’s past
as a moody bastard with problem-
atic social skills.
If you want something more
hands-on, then IL-2 Sturmovik,
the World War 2 flight simulator,
finally makes a return to the PC.
Reality whores will be pleased to
know that the aircraft repertoire
has expanded even further since
last time, and the rest of you will be
pleased to know that, yes, there are
more things to blow up this time.
Skateboarding, whilst not hav-
ing the universal appeal of killing
things, still seems to be keeping
popular. Tony Hawk’s Downhill
Jam last week is followed up by the
release of Project 8 on the other
consoles - a return to more tra-
ditional roots for the series, with
some improved physics that un-
fortunately do little more than help
you wince more when you bail (and
you will, frequently). If you loved
Tony Hawk’s in the past, though,
and were turned off by American
Wasteland or Underground, then
it might be time to return to the
series.
And finally, if you’re feeling bored
with Neverwinter Nights 2 already
and want a decent single-player
romp, Dungeon Siege 2 is now in
budget, and can be snapped up for
just £17.99. Alternatively, pick up
every Baldur’s Gate game ever
released on the PC, as well as the
original Neverwinter Nights col-
lection, in a new compilation pack,
for just £24.99.
