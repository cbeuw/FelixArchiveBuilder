I, Gamer
I
t’s amazing, really, that
we’re still taken in by
it all. Every few years
it’s the same old story
- promises that can’t be
kept, bizarre marketing cam-
paigns, and just when you’re
sure that everything will go
wrong, it gets released and the
same number of people buy it
again. Yes, it’s that time in the
product cycle - a new console is
upon us.
And though it might be a few
months away for us backward
fools in Europe, America and
Japan are now receiving their
(albeit reduced) shipments of
Playstation 3s already, and are
playing the next stage of Sony’s
dream. It’s been a long year, but
finally the Xbox 360 has a next-
gen competitor - the next few
weeks will be crucial in seeing
how the balance shifts, not for-
getting the imminent release
of Nintendo’s most anticipated
console in almost two decades.
Sometimes I wonder who
actually worries about this
though, since the average
gamer is likely to save up and
purchase any console he likes
the look of (Gender-restricted
gamer stereotype? Oh no he
didn’t!)
The Wii looks fantastic, and I
want one; the Playstation 3 has
secured a good deal of impor-
tant franchises; and the Xbox
360 is a curvaceous beauty with
Halo 3. Who wouldn’t want to
get a hold of and play all three
of them? And no, we can’t af-
ford all three of them. And no,
nor can most. But I wouldn’t
say any of us were biting our
nails at the prospect of there
only being two consoles in the
next-next-generation race.
The fact that a lot of the in-
dustry, the media, and half of
the blogosphere seem to miss,
is that gaming is not something
that can actually be torn apart
by something as petty as mar-
ket forces. If Sony finally pay
for taking one risk too many,
then SquareEnix and Konami
will just move on to other plat-
forms. If Bungie suddenly go
under, the first-person shooter
genre will soldier on without
them. Take a glance online and
you’ll see the comics, the ma-
chinima, and the bedroom cod-
ing scene still bubbling over,
still continuing to work and de-
velop regardless.
Still, it’s fun to watch compa-
nies throw thousands of pounds
away on post-modern market-
ing schemes, before deciding
to just paint the thing pink and
re-release it, right?

The third time’s the charm
Felix Games asks if it’s three-in-a-row for Sony, or strike one for the Industry giant
I remember the Playstation. I
remember saving up a consider-
able sum of money and buying one,
around the time that Final Fantasy
VII made its debut – though at the
time, the only games I were inter-
ested in involved pretty simple plat-
forming. The Playstation had been
out for some time, but the feel of
getting a new console is the same
each and every time. It feels like
the future.
Well, the Playstation 3 has one
thing in common with that: it is
the future for you reading this now.
Surprisingly for Sony, who were the
earliest entrant into the last gen-
eration (excluding the Dreamcast
which, let’s face it, failed), Europe
won’t see the new console until
March 2007. In fact, at the time of
going to press Phil Harrison, Sony’s
development chief in Europe, re-
fused to promise even March as a
confirmed release date.
Whatever the fate of Sony’s con-
sole in Europe, however, it has hit
more distant shores – and all eyes
are on the battle between Microsoft
and the newcomer to see the future
of console gaming. Why not Wii? Put
It runs Blu-Ray. It runs Linux. It runs the internet, wirelessly. It
seems like the only place the PlayStation 3 doesn’t run is Europe...
simply, Nintendo is playing its own
game. The Xbox team knows it. Phil
Harrison knows it. The media know
it. The Wii – which launches in just
a few weeks time, worldwide – is a
completely different kind of com-
petitor in the next-gen. For Sony
and Microsoft, however, the town
may finally not be big enough for
the two of them. Has the third ‘Sta-
tion got what it takes?

On the paper In the box
It just wouldn’t be a Sony console
launch without very shiny cars, or
that girl in lycra.
This time, it’s fair to say that
Ridge Racer 7 goes beyond merely
‘shiny’ - the game runs at a solid 60
frame per second in full high-defini-
tion quality. Forget the claim about
200,000 ways of customising the
cars, forget the 14-player online op-
tion - this game is unbelievable to
watch in action. Namco’s reputa-
tion for slick, fluid racing remains.
20 tracks, all playable in reverse
too, and the ability to slash loading
times by installing a chunk of the
game onto the PS3’s hard drive.
“I want to make something where
you feel as though you’re in a space
where you’re always connected
to other players without an on-
line connection,” Hideo Teramoto
told Famitsu, the Japanese maga-
zine, “It has a refreshing sense of
speed.”
Refreshing is the word. Ridge
Racer 7, by the time it hits the UK,
will be one of the PS3’s most promi-
nent online racers.
Next-generation means you need to
be seen to do something differently.
For the Playstation 3, this means a
few things, and most of them could
be described as ‘experimental’.
DVDs are out. Blu-Ray and HD-
DVDs are the two competitors for
the future of data storage. Micro-
soft put their money one way, and
Sony went the other. The Blu-Ray
disc currently holds 50Gb of data,
more than the 15Gb capacity of
an HD-DVD, but the technology is
markedly more expensive - report-
edly costing Sony in the region of
$100 for each console using one of
the drives.
The Cell architecture is also
something that Sony pushed when
selling their console to the media.
The technology, which came at a
huge price to develop, outstrips
the theoretical performance of the
Xbox 360 by double - but the mem-
ory differences between the two
have led most development compa-
nies to declare the consoles more
or less equal.
But what of the third contender -
The Wii? Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
will compete on raw power alone
for the foreseeable future, and it
looks like another even battle. But
that’s also a huge problem for them
both. The controller, the console,
and even the games released this
week all hark back to five years ago.
The one thing both consoles seem
to have forgotten is the one thing
the Wii has in droves - change. And
funny urine jokes.
Processor - 3.2 GHz Cell microproc-
essor. The Cell technology was de-
veloped with IBM and Toshiba in a
project costing around $400million.
Graphics - NVIDIA G70 256Mb
GPU.
Inputs - Flash, USB 2.0, Bluetooth
2.0, GigaBit Ethernet.
Outputs - HDTV compatible. 7.1
digital audio support.
Things turn nasty at the WalMart PlayStation 3 launch night
Ridge Racer 7
In your hand
The Sixaxis controller is a wireless
adaptation of the classic Playsta-
tion controller. Its battery life is ap-
proximately 40 hours, and though
some internet websites claim to
have replaced the batteries inside
themselves, Sony have promised to
replace expired wireless batteries
free of charge.
In the news
The Playstation 3 launch has been
a trial for Sony. Blu-Ray technology
(see left) was the cause of multiple
delays, there was a furore once the
shelf life of the Sixaxis controller
was announced, and the media gi-
ant recently came under fire for a
legal battle against import website
Lik Sang, which soon forced the site
to cease trading.
Despite that, the forecast is for
Playstation 3 to bring Sony’s mar-
ket share to 53% by 2010 - and econ-
omists always beat PR execs.
Resistance: The Fall of Man
Guns and zombies. It’s always
guns and zombies. And we like guns
and zombies. Guns, zombies, and
alternate histories where World
War 2 never happened. It’s like the
plot to every great B-Movie ever,
rolled into one.
R:TFoM is a first-person shoot-
er from the creators of the sur-
real platformer Ratcher & Clank.
It’s sci-fi colliding with the crea-
tive minds behind one of the most
tongue-in-cheek adventure games
on the Playstation 2, and it shows.
The game is definitely intense, ac-
tion-wise, but it also displays a sat-
isfying playability. The weapons,
whether they fire bullets that bur-
row through walls or dual-wielded
pistols that - for the first time - can
actually be dual-wielded, are in-
credibly weighty and feel good to
use. Not surprising, from the de-
velopers that brought us the Suck
Cannon and the Sheep Ray.
Xbox 360 is still waiting for its kill-
er app, asserts IGN, but “PlaySta-
tion 3 users get theirs on day one.”
Genji - DOB
Or Days Of The Blade, as the
subtitle reads. GDOB is a sequel to
Genji: Dawn of the Samurai, and it
once again loosely based on an epic
tale from Japanese history.
Loosely being the key word, of
course, since the game quickly be-
came famous for featuring “Giant
Enemy Crab” as one of its challeng-
ing bosses.
The camera work might be a bit
off, and yes, it’s true to question the
historical accuracy of Giant Enemy
Crab and his weak spot which was
reputedly able to be ‘attacked for
massive damage!’. But Days of the
Blade is a healthy replacement for
the absent Onimusha, and offers
some visually impressive hacking
and slashing.
As with Ridge Racer 7, the game
can be partially installed to reduce
loading times. But even with a large
hard drive, it’s not clear whether
most gamers will want to sacrifice
up to a quarter of it just to wait a
little less for a level to load.
Genji won’t break any records, but
it’s a simple and fun launch title.
