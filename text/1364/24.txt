Eggs: we really love them
Fry, poach, bake or boil ‘em, eggs can provide a tasty meal to the student in a hurry
Eggs are something that can be
kept in the fridge for a couple of
weeks and can save you in an emer-
gency. You can boil, fry, poach or
bake them or whip up a meal in the
form of an omelette.
Boiled eggs
One of the most basic ways to serve
up an egg, but also often messed
up. Soft boil them and serve with
buttered soldiers, or boil them a
little longer for a hard yolk and use
in salads and other dishes. There
are a few rules to follow if you want
your egg perfectly boiled. Very cold
eggs are likely to crack if you put
them in boiling water, so try not to
take them straight from the fridge.
A small egg in a large pan is like-
ly to bump around and result in a
cracked egg too. An accurate timer
is also essential; guessing timings
is the perfect way to ruin a boiled
egg.
For an infallible method do as
follows:
Place your eggs in a small pan
and cover with cold water so that it
is at least 1cm above the top of the
egg. Bring the water up to the boil
and then reduce the heat so the wa-
ter is simmering and use the follow-
ing timings:
3 minutes if you want your yolk
very runny and a wobbly white.
4 minutes if you want a yolk that is
creamy and a white that is set.
5 minutes for a yolk that is set
Chelsea’s little Italy is reasonable and rustic
This summer, a rather funny thing
happened; we woke up with split-
ting headaches after an exception-
ally heavy night at Boujis and de-
cided we wanted some food. Free
food to be precise, and so decided
henceforth that though our current
positions as Felix nightlife review-
ers provided us with free alcohol,
man cannot live on champagne and
the occasional canapé alone, and
the time had come to masquerade
as food critics.
Yes, I hear most of you cry, we
might not know a couchant du mere
if it fell into our bowl of tautet sur
vin, but we thought we could learn
this as we went along. On that par-
ticular morning, we both had a pen-
chant for pizza, so we set off through
the streets of Chelsea in search of
a suitable establishment. The Hut
was too common, Express told us
to ‘piss off’ and as for Organic - let’s
not go there. After an exhaustive
search, we chanced upon a cosy
Italian restaurant on the Fulham
Road, located conveniently around
the corner from Evelyn Gardens
called Riccardo’s
Upon entering, we instantly felt at
home with the rustic Italian décor
and promptly took a seat in the con-
servatory area that projected onto
the street; proving an ideal van-
tage point for viewing the hoards of
shoppers, sloaney ponies and ano-
rexic, chiwawa-sporting yummy-
mummies bustling past.
After a brief chat with the cheer-
ful (and genuinely Italian) staff, we
were introduced to the eponymous
owner Senor Riccardo Marriti, a
charming middle aged Florentine
with a faint hint of Rupert Ever-
ett about him. After quizzing him
in our pidgin Italian, we found out
he spoke flawless English and he
proceeded to tell us of his desire to
introduce traditional family Floren-
tine recipes to a wider audience.
To start, we sampled a large to-
mato and mozzarella salad, liber-
ally drenched in olive oil. Simple
but delicious. An established food
critic, a silver tongued courtesan of
the courses, might have highlight-
ed that the avocado accentuated
the textual variation of the dish,
whilst wonderfully complementing
the beefy tomatoes and the firm,
mature mozzarella – very much
reminiscent of our early childhood
in the hills of Tuscany… However
we prefer to honour it with the epi-
thet of: ‘‘f**king tasty’.
The main course proved another
carnival of delights. One of us sam-
pled a Margherita Pizza (nice and
simple- strong hint of oregano), the
other a special pasta compiled by
the chef (a unique and novel com-
bination). The home-made Italian
dairy ice-cream, served with ex-
cellent coffee, proved a wonderful
end to a fabulous meal, and the ac-
companying house-white was crisp,
dry and complemented the courses
perfectly. The restaurant has a busy
atmosphere, with everyone chat-
ting to everyone else, whilst Ricca-
rdo flits between tables. One of us
happened to mention knife-throw-
ing in the conversation and, before
we could stop him, Riccardo had
drawn one of his wooden shutters,
and was brandishing a steak-knife.
In conclusion, Riccardo’s is a
fabulously social slice of Italy in the
chic surroundings of Chelsea, and
the surprisingly cheap prices led to
it being ideal date material… Bon
appetito!

oming to university
will mean most of
you will be away
from home, fending
for yourself, for the
first time. Some struggle with
the washing machine and iron,
most ignore the cleaning, but
cooking is the most daunting
task of them all. Over the course
of your university career you will
have to feed yourself over 2000
meals. Some will cope with the
usual quota of beans on toast,
ready meals, and sandwiches,
but some will want to venture out
of the ready meal isles and into
the fresh meat or pulses section.
Well, help is at hand with my
(fairly) regular page of domestic
bliss! I’ll be providing you with
some easy recipes and ideas for
cooking the cheapest ingredients
around.

7 minutes if you want a hard
boiled egg. In this case you must
run the egg under cold water after
cooking to avoid a black ring form-
ing around the yolk.
Omelette
Omelettesareamealinthemselves.
One person will need 2-3 eggs, de-
pending on the egg and stomach
size. Omelettes can be jazzed up
easily with a few chopped herbs,
some cooked bacon, grated cheese,
or anything else you fancy.
Beat your eggs lightly in a bowl
until the yolks and whites are
mixed. Season with salt and pepper.
This is the stage at which to add
any extras as well, but make sure
they have been cooked already as
the eggs take around a minute to
cook.
On a hob: heat a medium sized
frying pan containing a teaspoon of
half oil and half butter to as high a
heat as you can. Swirl the fat around
so that it covers the base and the
base of the sides of the pan.
Pour the egg mixture in and leave
for a few seconds to set. After this
time a bubbly film should form
around the edge of the pan.
Tilt the pan and draw the edge
of the omelette into the middle so
that the runny egg in the middle
runs out and fills the space. Now
tilt the pan in the other direction
and repeat the same thing a cou-
ple more times. By this time there
should be a little bit of runny egg on
the surface- your omelette is ready
to be folded. Tilt the pan again and
fold the omelette in half and turn
onto a plate. It will keep cooking
on the plate, so it is essential that
the egg is slightly soft on the top, or
the omelette will go tough. It should
be nice and fluffy in the middle and
golden around the edges.
