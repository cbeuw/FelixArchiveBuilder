I
mperial College played
host to Lord Robert Win-
ston in a lecture organ-
ized by the chaplaincy. The
lecture, entitled ‘Playing
God,’ explored the rela-
tionship between science
and religion from Lord Winston’s
perspective. Its aim was to stimu-
late further reflection on the matter
and encourage further discourse.
Lord Winston’s talk took us on
a fascinating historical journey,
beginning with Pieter Brueghel’s
1563 painting The Tower of Babel.
Depicting the construction of the
tower, the painting is believed to be
a comment on mankind’s failed at-
tempt to be like God. Winston used
this painting as the starting point
for his first question of the evening,
“Do we have so much information
that we do not need God?”
Winston argued that, whether
we are spiritual or not, history has
shown a strong desire for spiritu-
alism. He presented photographs
of stenciled hand outlines in the
Pyrenean Grotte de Gaga. These
dark, damp, inhabitable caves are
said to be mankind’s first cathe-
drals. Around 250 hands are paint-
ed there, many of them with miss-
ing fingers. These missing fingers
were initially believed to be caused
by mutilation, either due to ritual
or the cold of the Ice Age. How-
ever, skeletons found nearby the
caves and in the surrounding area
show no evidence of digits miss-
ing. Therefore, it is believed that
the hands were stenciled with the
fingers deliberately curled, similar
to hunting signals, in an attempt to
reach the transcendental through
the walls of the caves. In a similar
vein, Winston considered Stone-
henge: the passion, dedication and
sacrifice required in moving those
monumental stones. Drawing also
on Christianity (the thousands of
people, some of them non-spir-
itual, who turned up to see Pope
John Paul II last Easter) and Is-
lam (the painstakingly exquisite
designs of their temples), Winston
concluded that mankind has made
numerous attempts to reach the
transcendental.
Next, Winston explored the sci-
entific, asking whether there is a
genetic tendency towards spiritu-
ality. Much experimental work has
been carried out on human spiritu-
ality, given that all cultures display
it in one form or another. Dr Dean
Hamer, a geneticist and author
of the book The God Gene: How
Faith Is Hardwired into Our Genes
found that there are particular
configurations of a dopamine-like
neuro-transmitter in spiritual peo-
ple. Tom Bouchard, a psychologist,
traced twins who had been separat-
ed at birth and compared monozy-
gotic and dizygotic twins. He found
that, irrespective of environment,
monozygotic twins showed similar
attitudes in intrinsic religiousity.
Both studies seem to indicate that
in many cases there is a genetic
predisposition to spirituality and we
are hard-wired to search for some-
thing deeper and transcendental.
There is also evidence that spir-
ituality may have helped humanity.
For example, in general, the people
who survived Auschwitz were those
who displayed some form of spiritu-
ality. Winston did not provide much
evidence for this, but used the story
of Auschwitz-survivor Viktor Frankl
to help illustrate his point. Frankl
found spirituality to be a comfort
to him throughout his troubles,
and experienced three modes of
thought during his ordeal. The first
was sheer terror and disbelief, the
second was a survival-of-the-fittest
type mentality, and the third was a
belief that there was someone (be it
a deity or a deceased family mem-
ber) looking down on them; a belief
that they shouldn’t lose hope.
A
fter an exhilarat-
ing, occasion-
ally disjointed
journey, Winston
moved onto the
core of his talk;
thenotionof‘play-
ing God’. He asked whether one can
view the human embryo as a human
being and discussed Nicholas Hart-
soeker, who examined seminal fluid
under a microscope and believed
he could see a tiny man within each
sperm. This discovery led Rabbi
Pinhar Elijah bon Meir to state that
wasted sperm is like murder. Win-
ston points out that, whilst the eth-
ics behind this are sound, they are
wrong as we now know that there is
no person inside sperm. This shows
that our ethics can only be as good
as our knowledge (in this case sci-
entific). The two go hand-in-hand,
so it is impossible to ignore the
science. For this reason, Winston
disagrees with the Catholic view
that life begins at conception. For a
biologist, there is no conception – it
is a continuation. Take for example
the mouse that was pathogenically
induced in Japan. In that particular
case, conception never took place,
yet life was produced.
For the final part of his talk, Win-
ston addressed the use of gene mod-
ification to eradicate diseases. Win-
ston discussed his own work, which
involves inserting gene constructs
into the testes of a baby mouse, and
asked why we shouldn’t use meth-
ods such as this in humans to en-
hance their quality of life. Consider
the plight of Sardinia where every
sixth inhabitant carries the beta-
thalassemia gene. Surely we should
do all we can to eradicate this gene
from future generations. But this is
playing God – and is it right?
Winston himself believes that
there is nothing wrong with play-
ing God. In fact, it is “desirable” as
we use what we’ve been given to
promote life. However, the problem
arises when we try to supplant God.
Additionally, the consequences of
enhancing humans are not certain
– we do not understand the full ef-
fects. In Winston’s view, “Man may
be unique, but he is insignificant.”
Like it or not, there are things that
cannot be explained, for example,
the Boxing Day tsunami, and it
bothers Winston when scientists
think they have all the answers.
Certainly, we cannot prove the
existence of God – but nor can we
prove the non-existence of God. In
Winston’s view, phrases such as
“God delusion” are dangerous and
do not promote social cohesion,
whereas religion itself has been
shown to be a cohesive force in so-
ciety. Throughout the talk, Winston
disapproved of Richard Dawkins’
fundamentalist denigration of peo-
ple having religious beliefs, which
he believes to be an attitude un-
healthy for society.
Lord Winston’s final point was
that science and religion are both
about uncertainty – both are at
their most dangerous when they
become certain.
One disappointment for me in
Robert Winston and playing God
Imperial’s most famous ‘celebrity scientist’ speaks about the age-old conflict between science and religion
particular was that the talk didn’t
really explore the ways in which a
scientist can incorporate their faith
into their work or indeed whether
Winston thought this was possible.
While it is known that Lord Winston
has a deep, long-held interest in
Judaism, he, perhaps wisely, chose
to keep the details of his religious
stance private, insisting that it is
personal (much to the chagrin of
the gentleman seated behind me).
Additionally, the talk merely high-
lighted the uncertainty of science
and religion (and the need for mu-
tual respect between the two), and,
in contrast to my prior expectations,
did not bring anything particularly
provocative to the table.
However, it was made clear at
the beginning that this was not
the aim of the talk. The aim was
to simulate further discourse and,
judging by the questions at the
end, this was achieved. Overall,
I found Lord Winston’s talk to be
enjoyable and thought-provoking.
He drew on interesting historical
aspects to illustrate his points and
the overall result was a measured
and thoughtful take on the science-
religion relationship.

While most of Robert Winston’s speech was a thoughtful overview of the science/religion conflict, he still had time for a little disco dancing
