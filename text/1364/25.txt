Do you have good taste in arse?
Two weeks ago in Coffee Break’s
2006-07 debut, Sergeant Hartman
managed to forget to display the
maximum score attainable for that
round, and as a result nobody really
knows. Since the error was discov-
ered, the idiot has been relieved of
his duties and shipped off to Iraq,
and in the process of “fighting for
freedom”, has subsequently per-
ished following a tragic incident
involving a fun loving fellow sol-
dier and a rock which was thrown
at his head – another sad victim
of “friendly fire”. Being the boot
camp’s resident reporter, I’ll be a lot
more informative than that cocky
bastard ever was, and I have most
of the insider knowledge on current
events that he never did. The rest
of the dorm always thought he was
damned tosser anyway, and his re-
placement at boot camp as a much
sexier arse. He’ll be sorely missed.
By someone. Possibly.
On to business…by the time you
all read this, the NUS circus (both
of them) will have been in and out of
campus and hopefully not coming
back, since voting closed on Thurs-
day night. Thank fucking God – I re-
ally cannot stand hearing another
word about why my vote counts,
firstly by the actual NUS staff on
the main walkway (because they’re
fucking sad enough that they didn’t
manage to get many students cam-
paigning for them) and then by the
same idiot on the opposite end of
the spectrum who thinks that if I
vote no, the chess club will get an-
other three thousand pounds a year
to spend in the union bar.
Anyway, Lieutenant Sykes is
prowling around boot camp this
week when he isn’t being lectured
to by those asshole NUS types tell-
ing him to vote yes or no to some
sort of referendum about whether
he’ll have the privilege of buying a
discount card that he never needed
in the first place, which means that
the troops are training particularly
hard to work up those sweat beads
on our backsides so that he gives
us a bit of a favourable eye when
inspection time comes around
– and believe me, he knows a good
arse when he sees one, just like
us – more teenage underage girls,
anyone? But here’s the question
– do you know arse as well as we
do? This week’s FUCWIT is your
chance to find out, as we go back
to basics with a good old Arse or
Elbow quiz. I’m also feeling gener-
ous enough (and believe me that’s
a rarity) to re-publish our first quiz
in case some of you thick, lazy lot
missed it. Name the building, NOT
the department(s) that uses it, al-
though you could do that for a con-
solation point. As for Arse or Elbow,
the answer is self-explanatory. Get
cracking, as at the end of the year
the top teams will win lots of booze
and prizes! Mail your answers as
usual to coffee.felix@imperial.ac.uk
and while you’re at it, do more push
ups, you could use them.

Let’s start off easy because I
don’t want anyone to have no
points. That would make you sad.
This building is mainly here to an-
noy us with constant chiming on
special occasions.
Welcome to Nerd Central. The
stench of curry from last year’s
exam season still fills the air.
The Sarge pauses near the build-
ing that whistles on windy days.
What’s this place called?
Sarge pauses to take a look at the
home of its slightly more drunk-
en, lower class citizens. He makes
a hasty getaway.
Welcome to the Biomedical Engi-
neer’s project for restoring to the
blind. You can be excused for not
wanting to know why.
The only place at Imperial Col-
lege you’ll ever see a naked lady.
Where is the Sarge currently
jacking off?
One final extra hard bonus ques-
tion. What’s the name of this
building, and what lies beyond
these double doors?

Plenty of Imperial students have
many stories to tell about this
place, but currently the entrance
is blocked off.

Round 1 - Where is Sarge?
Maximum of 20 points
Name the building Sarge is
visiting. Two points for a cor-
rect answer and one for a de-
partment only. There are two
mystery spit-shined bonus
marks available for this one.
Round 2 - Arse or Elbow?
Maximum of 18 points
Do you seriously need a bloody
explanation of how to answer
this one? No bonus marks here
because that would be wrong.
That, and all extra arse tends to
come my way.
