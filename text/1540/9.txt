Each week,

t’s a dialogue, not a debate”.
his declaration is the ﬁrst
point from the guidelines
for interfaith discussion
written by Imperial stu-
dents. Debates can dramatise con-
ﬂicting ideas but dialogue is as much
about listening as it is about speaking.
Debates are necessary when mak-
ing public and democratic decisions.
But debates rarely help us understand
views that are radically diﬀerent from
our own. his is because beliefs, both
religious and philosophical, are not
just ideas. Beliefs are frequently root-
ed in complex identities. hese can
involve shared culture, social relation-
ships and family networks. In addition
beliefs often have a physical dimension
– food customs, dress codes, and pos-
tures for prayer. And all of these will
have an emotional component and be
part of deep personal memories, val-
ues and expectations. his rich human
experience cannot be explored in a
debate over ideas. Dialogue partners
do not seek agreement, and there is no
winner. he challenge of dialogue is in
exploring profound diﬀerences of view
– and staying calm. he bonus, howev-
er, is that we discover the unique per-
sonal perspective of the other person.
We also start to see how our beliefs,
and very identity, are seen by others.
his is not always a comfortable expe-
rience. It is far easier to stay with our
own assumptions, projections, and
tribal fears than enter into dialogue.
At a conference at Yale last sum-
mer I listened to Eboo Patel, President
Obama’s Interfaith Advisor. Patel, a
Muslim, is the Founder of the Inter-
faith Youth Core. his is a student led
interfaith movement across US cam-
puses promoting dialogue and social
action. Patel was originally motivated
by witnessing anti-Semitism and bul-
lying in his high school. He has gone
on to champion better relationships
between people of diﬀerent faiths, and
now between those who are religious
and those who are secular.
Patel argues “I started to see atti-
tudes, knowledge, and relationships as
three sides of a triangle. If you know
some (accurate and positive) things
about a religion, and you know some
people from that religion, you are far
more likely to have positive attitudes
toward that tradition and that com-
munity. he more favourable your atti-
tude, the more open you will be to new
relationships and additional appre-
ciative knowledge. A couple of cycles
around this triangle, and people from
diﬀerent faiths are starting to smile
at each other on the streets instead of
looking away or crossing to the other
side.”
In the next few weeks there are a
number of student led interfaith dia-
logues. On Tuesday 26 February (18:15
in Huxley 311) the Ahmadiyya Muslim
Students Association (AMSA), with
the Chaplaincy, are hosting a Muslim-
Christian dialogue about the origins of
humanity using the story of Adam and
Eve common to both traditions. his
is followed by a series of three weekly
lunchtime dialogue groups hosted
by Aemun Reza, the Union’s Inter-
faith Oﬃcer, starting on Wednesday
6 March (13:00 in Room 2, East Base-
ment of Beit). he ﬁrst topic for dia-
logue is ‘I believe in…Science’.
A Jewish-Muslim Dialogue led by
Jewish Society and AMSA is planned
for 4th March. And ﬁnally, Islamic
Society are hosting a discussion on
“Freedom of Religion in Britain” with
representatives from the Catholic So-
ciety, and the Atheists, Secularists and
Humanists Society on Tuesday 19 Feb-
ruary (Huxley 311). Let the dialogues
begin!
