Welcome to the insane asylum
Population:Ross Webster
t has been a long time since
my brain has hurt this much.
I’ve just worked out how to
reach the bottom of an end-
less staircase, and now I’m
faced with a laser puzzle that needs
30 pieces, when I’ve only got 12, and
I can’t even move them around. Wel-
come to Antichamber.
Imagine a game like Portal, where
you have to complete puzzles to reach
the next room, but where your path
to the end of the game isn’t linear,
nor is how you complete each cham-
ber. Instead of placing portals around
the level, you can instead pick up and
place brightly coloured blocks – think
of them as mini Minecraft blocks if it
helps. So far, this description would
make for a Portal-esque game; you’ve
got a mission, a gun that helps you get
around the game, and some puzzles
thrown in. hat’s not all Anticham-
ber is, however – if Escher could have
made a video game – I feel it would
be a lot like this. For example, say you
are walking along a corridor, turn-
ing 90 degrees to your right, every 5
metres, with no incline. hen, after
doing this 10 times, the corridor sud-
denly becomes straight when you turn
the corner. Being an FPS, it’s weird to
know that your mind is being tricked
quite easily, yet you don’t see how or
where it happened.
he artistic style of Antichamber
makes you feel like you’re trapped in
a modern art museum, with pristine
white walls, ceilings and ﬂoor. Lit-
tle motivational images are posted
around the game – often giving subtle
hints as to how you should approach
the next chamber. here’s sporadic use
of colour in some areas – you may go
through multiple white-walled cham-
bers, before coming across a large
room, where you need to make your
way to the end, using the coloured
corridor sections as a guide.
Once you’ve learned the tricks of
trade, and know what to expect, the
game will then throw something obvi-
ous into the mix, and stump you for
another good 5 minutes before you
facepalm, and wonder why you even
thought it would be good to procras-
tinate this way.
he block-play isn’t too repetitive ei-
ther – there are upgrades available to
your launcher that make older puzzles
quicker to run through, and new puz-
zles, managable.
As soundtracks go, Antichamber‘s
may not be as odd as you think – it’s
not your normal game OST, with a
thematic motif... or any emotion – it’s
just sounds. Relaxing sounds at least.
I expect that if they added anything
more energetic, there’d be more tem-
per tantrums than usual. Being made
in the Unreal engine, the graphics look
ﬁne and will work on any relatively re-
cent and decent laptop, although you
might ﬁnd there are some issues with
the screen resolution (nothing too had
too ﬁx with notepad).
here’s not much, in terms of replay-
ability, as a lot of the ‘fun’ is from not
knowing what to do. here’s a timer
in the menu room, that counts down
from 1hr 30min, so at least you’ll be
able to speedrun the game...
It’s available on Steam for £14.99 –
and I can’t see any reason, why after this
great success, we wouldn’t see a 360 or
PS3 version. With DLC though. :(

Valve games into films? Sign me up!
Laurence Pope I want to believe
It has to be said that films based
on video games don’t tend to get
critically praised. Browsing Wiki-
pedia shows that the highest Rot-
ten Tomatoes score one has ever
achieved is 43%, which is less than
impressive. They are not, in gen-
eral, the kind of films I pay to see.
But things might well change.
Cue J.J. Abrams’ production com-
pany Bad Robot and Valve coming
together to make films based upon
Valve’s game series Half-Life and
Portal. The announcement was
made at the end of a keynote speech
delivered by Abrams and Valve’s
co-founder and CEO Gabe Newell,
entitled “Storytelling Across Plat-
forms: Who Benefits Most, the Au-
dience or the Player?”. The speech,
part of the 2013 D.I.C.E (Design,
Innovate, Communicate, Enter-
tain) summit, took the form of a
discussion between the two men
as they talked about the strengths
and weaknesses of films and video
games as storytelling mediums.
Previously other Hollywood di-
rectors have approached Valve
about making a Half-Life film; in
Newell’s words, “…their stories
were just so bad. I mean, brutally,
the worst. Not understanding what
made the game a good game, or
what made the property an inter-
esting thing for people to be a fan
of.” Up until this point Valve had
considered making their own HL
film in order to do the series jus-
tice, and their work with the Team
Fortress 2 ‘Meet the Team’ shorts
was part of the experimentation
process. The joint announcement
by Abrams and Newell seem set to
change this idea.
So when can we expect some-
thing? Though much talk has no
doubt gone on between Newell and
Abrams there’s still little in the way
of concrete information available
to the public. Like all things Valve
undertakes the project will take
time, so don’t expect a 2013 release
(or even a 2014 one). Good things
come to those who wait, however,
and I for one am confident what-
ever Valve and Bad Robot Produc-
tions come up with will trump all
the other video game movies in the
market.
I guess Episode 3 can just wait a
little longer…
My money. All of it.
Take.
Maybe there would be an
Avengers-esque movie after
all the separate films. They
could fight an EA invasion.
Circus of
games news
Not a waste of our time?
InXile have shown us a good bunch
of gameplay footage of their alpha
build for Wasteland 2. Despite the UI
looking like it’s from the 90s, the in-
game graphics are promising, and the
gameplaylooksverysolid.Thisshould
stop some of the worrying that’s been
going on in Kickstarter-backer-land.
Batman Arkham Again
Those lovely people at Warner Bros.
has confirmed that there’ll be a new
Batman game coming out this year.
We don’t know a title, nor if London
developer Rocksteady is still on the
case – we’ll let you know when were
updated.
Come back when you get
some money, buddy.
