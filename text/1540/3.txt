hree second-year Civil Engineering
students make up the only team from
Imperial College to have passed onto
the Finals of the 2013 BP Ultimate
Field Trip challenge. Edward Court-
nell, Stephen Rose and Dominik
Sznajder are now facing teams from
Oxford, Strathclyde and Glasgow
Universities for the chance to win
a 2-week trip on a BP oil rig in the
North Sea and a cash prize of £1000.
he group of friends went from reg-
ular term work of solving problem
sheets and revising for progress tests,
to climbing up the ladder and im-
pressing BP executives at last week’s
Semi-Final.
he BP Ultimate Field Trip is a
ﬂagship competition not just in the
UK but all over the world. It gives
students the opportunity to have a
go at tackling real-life engineering
challenges and to come up with in-
novative solutions, which they then
need to research and sell to a panel
of 12 BP judges. Every year, the com-
petition revolves around a new topic.
his year, the challenge was to come
up with a single technical innovation
that could reduce the cost of PKT
(Passenger Kilometer Travelled) in
the UK by 2030. In other words, re-
duce the cost of public transporta-
tion. An interview of the three team-
mates has yielded valuable insight
into just what it takes to wow the
judges of the BP competition.
he ﬁrst stage involved an on-
line questionnaire where questions
were speciﬁcally designed not to
have simple solutions available on-
line. From then on, each step of the
competition required more research
and problem-solving to get the can-
didates into the mindset of what
being an engineer actually entails.
After successfully passing the ﬁrst
round, the team went on to produce a
powerpoint presentation, and then a
professional technical poster outlin-
ing their idea. heir main technical
innovation is Regenerative Breaking
with Onboard Storage. his technol-
ogy would allow train operators to
save money by harnessing the energy
that is lost through braking when the
trains stops. hat energy would be
stored onboard while the train is sta-
tionary, and then fed it back into the
motors when the train leaves, which
would allow for faster acceleration.
he team has calculated that this
technology could save train operators
105 million pounds a year. his would
be achieved by installing lithium-ion
capacitors on existing trains, which
would store the energy.
However having a good idea isn’t
the whole story. he team had to be
able to convince the judges of just
how eﬀective their technological in-
novation was. he structure of the
competition intends to allow them
to work on their presentation skills
and their ability to perform under
pressure, but what really separated
them from the herd was the sheer
amount of background research they
produced. his allowed them to shine
when it came to Q&A after last Tues-
day’s Semi-Final 10 minute presenta-
tion; and could well be the main rea-
son they are the only team that went
through from Imperial this year.
All three members agree that this
journey has showed them the impor-
tance of teamwork and perseverance.
If you had asked them back in Octo-
ber, none of them would have imag-
ined getting so far in the competition.
All three describe the experience as
“challenging but rewarding”. hey all
recommend the competition to Im-
perial students. Despite the amount
of work that is necessary, the journey
is enriching, and you get to visit BP’s
London oﬃces.
Emma Judge, Head of Graduate
Resourcing at BP, said: “Submis-
sions for this year’s UFT have been
better than ever and it’s great to see
Imperial College London making it
though to the Grand Final. We wish
Edward Courtnell, Stephen Rose
and Dominik Sznajder the very best
of luck and we’re looking forward to
seeing them again on the 8th March
in London. It’s going to be a great
night, and they have the extra bonus
this year of meeting the science man
of the moment, Dara O Briain!”.
he next step is to produce and edit
a video and a pitch, which they will
present to BP oﬃcials, judges and a
press-corps on March 8th, 2013. hey
will be working with a professional
editing company and BP experts to
make sure everything is ready for
the Final, which will take place in the
Royal Institute of Great Britain.

Ipsos MORI
stress security
of NSS
where they are sitting in an exam.
With this information, the only other
piece to the puzzle that is needed is
the day and month of birth; once this
information is obtained, the NSS can
be ﬁlled out. his can, of course, be
found using some choice Facebook
searching.
All of this leads to the possibility
of fraud, as well as someone being
able to build a programme that ﬁlls
out the survey on behalf of many stu-
dents.
Felix contacted Ipsos MORI, who
conducts the survey. Sami Benya-
hai, Director of Higher Education
Research, responded that they have
multiple safe guards in place. Ben-
yahai said: “Surveys submitted are
once again checked electronically
and where needed manually. Where
there is doubt about the identify of a
respondent the interview is rejected.
We send email conﬁrmations to re-
spondents to their university emails.
We collect IP addresses, monitor re-
sponse rates and response patterns.
We work closely with institutions
and students’ union[s].”
To complete the NSS, a student
must put in their CID, the ﬁrst let-
ter of their ﬁrst name, the ﬁrst four
letters of their last name, and the day
and month of their birth.
Research councils dictate that the
College must take part in the NSS,
and a failure to get a certain number
of replies leads to the result being
void. his aﬀects the standing of Im-
perial College London in the league
tables. he NSS is still going on, and
students who have not ﬁlled it out
yet will start receiving calls.
Felix also contacted the Business
School, but is yet to hear back, as the
story only came in very late.
