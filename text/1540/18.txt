The extinction of the political dinosaurs
ree speech is a wonder-
ful thing. It is one of the
things that makes this
country an amazing place
to live in. Granted, it may
not be absolute, but the opportu-
nity to be introduced to new
ideas, impart mine in
return and argue over
them is a positively
delightful experi-
ence. To me, there
is nothing more
enlightening than
thrashing out some
p o l i t i c a l
p h i l o s o - phy,
looking at
issues from
diﬀerent per-
spectives, amend-
ing your way of think-
ing or even dropping it
and searching for a new
one. his is not a weak
compromise – it is enrich-
ing your understanding of
the world through debate
which helps build a better
and coherent way to view
and deal with it.
Last week a rare but
delightful oddity oc-
curred. Democracy.
he Government
and Opposi-
tion did not
order MPs how t o vote,
but allowed them to make their
own decision. As the dust settled,
an overwhelming cry of support for
gay marriage was heard. Despite be-
ing glad with this outcome, I was a
tad frustrated. My
grudge does not lie
with those for vot-
ing against it generally,
as the discussion over
whether marriage is
a religious or civil
institution is a valid
one, but with those
people who use faith to wrap up their
discriminatory view that homosexu-
als are in some way inferior. Yes, the
Conservative party was
split on the vote and I
would not be surprised
if a good number of those
were guilty of my accusations.
However, I imagine that a good num-
ber of the Labour and Liberal Dem-
ocrat MPs were equally culpable.
here is no place for such neander-
thals in any political party. hank-
fully, if they do not evolve, they will
perish.
hese fossils are the sort which
makes people associate the Con-
servative party with wanting
to keep things as they are, or
turn the clock back. With an ever
changing social environment, such
traits are clearly evolutionarily dis-
advantageous. However, the Tories
have been consistently evolving, the
radicals leading the party accepting
arguments for change that are for
the betterment of society, with the
neanderthals passing away into the
mists of time. David Cameron was
a Leader that night. He championed
a tolerant, fair future that the previ-
ous Government did not. However,
unless the rest of the Conservative
creature advances with him, they
will drag his Premiership into extinc-
tion at the next election. he his-
tory books will not remember him
as a leader but only as the reforming
founder of the new Conservatives. I
assume though, that even the relics
would not be so stupid as to be the
cause of the collective extermination
of their genus.
F The end of the
old school?

Dear Sir,
Imperial is a relatively old universi-
ty, and I cannot help but feel that we
don’t celebrate this history enough.
Oxbridge comparisons are regu-
larly made by us Imperialites across
all manner of things, and while we
don’t quite match them in terms of
age, we still have plenty of tradi-
tion of our own. The indominable
Queens Tower, the RCS and RSM,
a huge number of Nobel leaureates,
Fields medalists, a proud sporting
tradition and social clubs over 85
years old that are still going strong.
(And this is without long and huge-
ly successfull history of the constit-
uent hospitals that now make up the
medical faculty!)
We are slowly losing some of the
important things that separate us
from the mediocre ex-polys that
are creeping up on us academical-
ly, with the Holland Club a case in
point. When things like that have
gone, they’re gone forever, part
of the faceless beaurocracy that is
taste/sport/(insert business area
here) Imperial. Medic sport in its
own right is the next thing on the
list; over a century of history and
tradition gone forever because of a
need for ‘BUCS points.’
Gone are the days of ‘mascotry’
(and no, the poor, ill-judged and
miscalculated attempt at the begin-
ning of this year does not count),
the days of being proud to represent
not just your university but your
faculty and subject too.
Some people are fighting the good
fight and not letting tradition slip
from our grasp: this year sees the
return of the Sparkes Cup, an inter-
faculty rugby tournament, the RSM
still smash the Cambourne ‘miners’
every year across every sport im-
aginable and occasionally Jezebel
the firetruck comes out; but unfor-
tunately the numbers of volunteers
that support these kind of things are
slipping and soon they too might be
a forgotten relic, left on the side as
we slip towards being just another
university.
How many of you when talking to
friends at home about Imperial be-
moan the ratio, the terrible state of
the Union or geekiness of Imperial?
We are all Imperialites, nobody
was forced to come here and it’s a
really cool place to be. We have a
unique blend of the academic, his-
tory, sport and a huge number (the
largest in the UK) of clubs and soci-
eties, but if you’re not proud to be
here and if you don’t get involved,
then in the words of a Super Cool
Ski instructor, You’re going to have
a bad time.
tl:dr: Imperial’s great if you whole-
heartedly buy into it. If you’re not
interested fuck off to a poly.
Regards,
A concerned undergrad.

Sir,
I was disappointed by the headline of a
recent article, ‘Life of a Total WBanker.’
It seemed to draw a comparison be-
tween bankers and wankers and, as a
long time wanker, I take great oﬀence
at this.
I have done no harm to society whilst
engaging in this pleasant and ﬁnan-
cially risk-free activity and do not force
the resulting mess onto others; unlike
bankers whose mess has ruined life for
the rest of us and cannot be avoided no
matter how careful you are.
