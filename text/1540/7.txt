Charing Cross A&E Department saved
Plans to close the Accident and Emer-
gency department of Charing Cross
Hospital have been scrapped in a last
minute decision. he original plan to
downgrade Charing Cross Hospital
has been changed so that the hospital
will still have a 24/7 emergency service
for those who make their own way to
the A&E. More complicated emergen-
cies, including blue light emergencies
will be directed to specialist centres.
he ﬁnal decision will be made by
NHS North West London (NHS NWL)
on February 19 but it is conﬁrmed that
the A&E unit will remain open. here
will also be a £90 million cash injection
to the hospital to help rebuild the site
and will secure the future of the hos-
pital.
Ealing, Hammersmith and Central
Middlesex Hospital are expected to
lose their A&E’s as a part of the Shap-
ing a Healthier Future programme that
needs to save around £1 billion over
the next three years as well as appar-
ently aiming to improve standards.
Aemun Reza News Editor However, the informal announce-
ment by the Hammersmith & Fulham
council was not seen as a major victory
to the campaign groups. Campaign
groups have said that this result is a
‘second-best deal’ and has fallen far
short of their expectations.
hey compare the deal to the one
that Lewisham Hospital was given last
week where its A&E was downgraded
from category one to a category three
unit.
Chair of the protest group, Carlo
Nero, said: “If we’re eﬀectively being
given the deal Lewisham was oﬀered
why should our local doctors be any-
less unhappy, and in some cases even
outraged, than theirs?
“It seems clear to me, having chaired
this campaign since last June, that this
is absolutely not the result that Save
our Hospitals was set up to achieve,
and that we should continue to cam-
paign.
hey believe that the 500 in-patient
bed and‘blue-light’ A&E will become
somewhat of a cottage hospital with
only 60 beds. he A&E usually treats
100,000 patients a year and has sepa-
rate funding for cancer, teaching and
mental health specialist departments
and a new community service role.
A spokesman for Save Hammer-
smith & Fulham hospitals said: “We
welcome the news that NHS North
West London seems to be prepared
to listen at last to residents’ concerns
about its ill-thought out consultation
plans to close four of the nine A&Es
currently serving the area.
“However, until we see their actual
proposal and read the small print we
will continue to campaign for the pres-
ervation of full A&E services at both
Charing Cross and Hammersmith
hospitals.”
Greg Hands, the Tory MP for Chel-
sea and Fulham said that “his is
deﬁnitely a step in the right direction
compared with what was originally
proposed, which was to reduce Char-
ing Cross to something like a tenth of
its current size.
“But we need to see more details and
compare this new plan not just with
the worst case scenario but also with
the status quo.”
Hammersmith and Fulham coun-
cillor Marcus Ginn said:“he massive
opposition from local people to the
original proposals has forced NHS
managers to rethink their plans.
“he £90m cash injection now pro-
posed by the NHS would secure the
hospital’s future for generations to
come and the top priority was always
to save Charing Cross and the services
so many of our residents rely on.
“In return, we have agreed to halt
our legal challenge to the NHS propos-
als as all but the most complex emer-
gencies will continue to be treated at
Charing Cross. We believe that we
have secured the best possible deal for
our residents.”
Imperial College London were con-
tacted for comment, however they had
none until after the public meeting on
the 19th February where all the details
will be announced.
A&E Department to remain open after a U-Turn
here has been a fantastic
response to the student
lead initiative, Action
Syria, raising awareness
about the situation in Syr-
ia at Imperial College. he turmoil in
Syria has become dramatically worse
over the last two years. he situation
in Syria is typically reported as politi-
cal issue in the headlines; however, the
focus of Action Syria has been solely
on the humanitarian side.
he President of the Islamic Society
at Imperial, Usman Siddiqui said “he
interest and concern shown by many
students for those suﬀering thousands
of miles away has been really uplift-
ing, as living in Central London many
neighbours do not even look out for
each other.”
Last Tuesday, the Keynote lecture
on Syria was held at Imperial. he
speakers included Iman Murphy, a
business woman, mother and an aid
worker for the charity “Hand in Hand
Syria”; Dr. Mahmoud Akraa, a medical
doctor who has treated injured people
in Syria; and Shaﬁul Amin the founder
for Students4Syria. hey all delivered
emotional speeches, speaking about
their experience in Syria as well as
motivating
the at-
tendees
to par-
ticipate
and make
a diﬀer-
ence.
I m a n
M u r p h y
k i n d l y
gave Fe-
lix a quote
as to why
s t u d e n t s
should do-
nate “we
share the
same sky,
live in the
same world;
r e g a r d l e s s
of age, creed
and gender
we have a
responsibil-
ity. For what it
would cost you to buy a pair of shoes
i s enough to feed
a family in Syr-
ia for a month.”
he good
news is if you
missed the
lecture, don’t
worry you
can still help
out. As a
major aspect
of the cam-
paign, there
is an items
collection
for an aid
c o n v o y
that will be
leaving for
Syria next
weekend.
his is an
opportu-
nity for
you to
directly
make a
diﬀerence to peo-
ple’s lives! Old clothes will be used to
generate funds and new ones will be
sent to Syria. he Union is also help-
ing and we have a drop oﬀ point at the
Union reception. here are more de-
tails on the website.
One of the organisers commented
“anyone can contribute, as students
we tend to have a lot of little things
that we rarely use or wear; this little
will go a long way, it will provide them
with hope and show the Syrian people
that others in the world do care and do
remember.”
he Facebook page also mentions
“When a similar collection was held in
the Midlands, people cleaned, ironed,
perfumed and wrapped the clothes
before giving. Some people attached
messages to the bags in the hope that
those receiving would not feel hurt or
inferior.”
One of the students response to the
campaign was “It’s easy to feel pow-
erless in the face of things that shock
and upset us, yet instead of surren-
dering themselves to apathy a young
group of Imperial students have built
a campaign from nothing, it’s very
impressive and has certainly inspired
me.”
