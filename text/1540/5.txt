As a scientific institution with in-
tense research into energy and climate
change, Imperial says it doesn’t take
these matters lightly and realises that
its everyday activities and operations
have a negative impact on the environ-
ment and carbon footprint, in particular.
Along with other attempts to increase
sustainability such as university wide
StepChange campaign, which aims to
reduce College’s footprint by 20% by
2014, another measure, launched by
Department of Energy and Environ-
ment, is coming – annual travel survey,
which, in addition to staff, also covers
students this year.
The aim of the survey is to assess
how student and staff members com-
mute to and from College and it com-
prises many aspects, including expens-
es, means such as public transport and
walking, as well as how long it takes.
This year there is a particular focus on
a new bike-hiring scheme, which Impe-
rial is planning to introduce, if it proves
to be popular. It also looks at other po-
tential improvements that will encour-
age more people to cycle. According to
Sara Muir, the staff sur-
vey last year
showed that people wanted bigger and
more secure bike parking and some of
these changes have been made as a re-
sult. She also notes: “It’ll be interesting
to find out when we repeat the survey
this year if more people are cycling that
reported last year.”
The results of the survey will help
to determine how success-
ful current travel initiatives
are and to further improve
sustainability in future
years. For example, last
year’s survey showed that
Silwood Park is the most
difficult site to get to and
now Imperial is looking
into setting up an online
car share website to im-
prove it. Moreover, not
only the results of the
survey will help to im-
prove the College’s own

Spanish Prime Minister corruptly defends right to
corrupt system
Spainish Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, con-
tinues to defend himself and his party from
allegations claiming they took bribes by
stating that they were simply taking
advantage of their constitutionally en-
shrined rights. “The right to be corrupt
and to accept a little something on the
side is a long-held Spanish tradition that
has been around for centuries” he stated,
before adding “I mean come on,
we would have been
more subtle about it
had we thought we

Pope resigns to spend more time with grandchildren
Citing declining health and a desire to “see the grandkids
more” Pope Benedict XVI has resigned from his position
as God’s representative on earth. In a statement, God said
he was “disappointed, but not as much as when Jean-Paul
II died” and that Benedict XVI was “a hard act to follow,
but ultimately not irreplaceable like that Jean-Paul II – man
was he a good Pope”.

UN states it is no longer possible to isolate North Korea
further
Following North Korea’s latest nuclear tests, the UN
Secretary-General, Ban Ki Moon, has stated that
North Korea is now “as isolated as it is possible to
be on a globe”. With all the UN member states now
having slowly moved their populace’s away from
dictatorship, North Korea finds politically and
physically isolated from the world. The UN
will now, in all likelihood, resolve to make
a motion to resolve to discuss the situa-
tion. Following discussions, loud tutting
and suggesting North Korea sits on the
naughty step are likely.
he motion ‘Imperial College Union
Access to Medicines Policy’ was pro-
posed to the Union Council on Tuesday
by ICSMSU President Shiv Vohra and
seconded by Kush Nake. he motion
was passed. In brief, this motion was
proposed in order for the Union to
actively campaign to persuade Impe-
rial College to sign the Global Access
Licensing Framework. his enables af-
fordable versions of research developed
medicine to be made available in medi-
cal resource-limited countries. his
framework was published by the inter-
national student-led organisation Uni-
versities Allied for Essential Medicines
under the guidance of various experts.
he same motion was proposed last
year in December 2012 and was not ap-
proved because of insuﬃcient Council
members voting in favour. his time
round, 24 Council members voted in
favour, which meant it passed. All sab-
batical oﬃcers abstained from voting
or voted against. When asked, Paul
Beaumont, Union President, replied:
“I voted against the motion because I
believe the Union Council should base
decisions only on something that has
been fully researched. No-one knows
what the impact of the proposal would
have on College ﬁnances (as was admit-
ted by the author in the meeting), and
therefore on students should the Col-
lege implement the framework.”
he motion provided the following
statistics and information. A third of
the world’s population lack access to es-
sential medicines and each year, 10 mil-
lion people die from treatable diseases.
10% of funded research on medicine
is spent on health problems that af-
fect 90% of the world’s population, the
Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs).
Industry is increasingly relying on aca-
demia for new drug targets because
universities are an important source of
new medicines and drug targets. Pres-
ently, Imperial College develops and
patents many of its healthcare-related
technologies, which are licensed to
members of the pharmaceutical indus-
try. his makes it diﬃcult for medicine
to be produced inexpensively. Univer-
sities including Oxford, Harvard and
Yale have had important roles in in-
creasing access to needed medicines by
implementing Global Access Licensing
Policies and have not seen a negative
impact on licensing nor proﬁts. Ge-
neric pharmaceutical production has
been shown to be the most eﬀective
method of ensuring access to resource
limited countries by reducing prices
of medicine as a result of competition.
If Imperial College avoids patenting
healthcare-related technologies, there
is an increased opportunity for prices
of medicine to be made aﬀordable to
those who need them.
he motion put forward on Tuesday
believes that the products of publicly
funded research should be made avail-
able to all members of all societies and
that research value should be meas-
ured on the impact it makes on soci-
ety. Furthermore, the motion believes
that Imperial College students should
be encouraged to learn about and con-
sider a research career in the ﬁeld of the
diseases that aﬀect 90% of the world’s
population.
Imperial College Union resolves to
actively campaign for Imperial College
to sign onto the Global Access Licens-
ing Framework. he Union also re-
solves to support inclusion of neglected
diseases topics on all relevant course
curriculums, particularly those in the
Department of Life Sciences and Facul-
ty of Medicine and to encourage UROP
(Undergraduate Research Opportuni-
ties Programme) projects on NTDs.

policies, they will also contribute to a
bigger picture as they will be part of the
Imperial’s report to HEFCE, an organi-
sation responsible for public funding of
English universities, which will then
feed into the Estates Management Sta-
tistics Survey from August 2013, which
has been designed to help managers un-
derstand current state of affairs, as well
as to promote best practice and drive
improvement.
Lasting only 15 minutes to, Student
Travel Survey is an opportunity not
only to make a contribution to the re-
duction of carbon footprint but also to
win a £100 Amazon voucher.
