26 directors, 26 ways to die. As hor-
ror anthology goes, this is the Con-
corde moment, 26 short ﬁlms from
some of the most twisted horror
minds, it’s a brave bold stab at some-
thing that may never be repeated.
hankfully there is no hackneyed
attempt to link them with an over-
arching story, each ﬁlm just starts
and ends with a red screen and a title
card. he directors vary in national-
ity, style and insanity. As with any
anthology ﬁlm, there will always be
high and low points. Some were just
too weird for my liking (and I have a
pretty high tolerance for weird), they
are all pretty diﬀerent and the fact
that the ones I didn’t like seemed to
me to have similar themes might just
reﬂect my tastes.
It’s always refreshing to see how
each director tackles the brief. Some
present just a climactic scene from
what you imagine as a longer ﬁlm,
some present whole stories in twist-
ed worlds (think he Twilight Zone),
others feel almost like bizarre advert
skits but without any product, and a
couple attempt to make meta-horror.
Many have a low budget, Troma-like
feel to them (think he Toxic Aveng-
er), there are plenty of nods to classic
ﬁlms and directors, and it’s a truly
international undertaking (I don’t
think there is a word of English spo-
ken for the ﬁrst 30 minutes). Clock-
ing in at over two hours it is long, but
I found that when it lagged the slack
was quickly picked up by another
short.
here are plenty of jaw-droppers.
he unparalleled Ben Wheatley (Kill
List, Sightseers) shows the closing
scene of a monster ﬁlm, from the
view of the monster. Jake West gives
a great chase scene, and I now for-
give him for the terrible Danny Dyer
vehicle Doghouse. Chilean director
Ernesto Díaz Espinoza (almost un-
known in the UK) gives a nice, tight
little time travel ﬁlm, similar in style
to Nacho Vigalondo’s Timecrimes
(who directs the ﬁrst of the anthol-
ogy). Less well known Timo Tjah-
janto, gives one of the weirdest and
most vile premises, but actually ends
up making one of the most intrigu-
ing (it deﬁnitely stayed with me the
longest).
he best in my opinion comes
from Marcel Sarmiento (the mind
behind the crowd dividing Dead-
girl). he cinematography, pacing
and suspense he manages in 5 min-
utes is better than most full lengths.
Other treats (if you can call them
that) include French Xavier Gens’
(frontier(s)) gorefest on body image,
and the stop-motion fun of Lee Hard-
castle (the winner of a competition to
send in home-made ﬁlms).
here are also a few duds. he usu-
ally great Ti West (of the spectacu-
larly retro he House of he Devil)
gives the laziest and most pathetic
entry. Noboru Iguchi gives one en-
titled Fart, which I deﬁnitely could
have done without. However he did
direct RoboGeisha and Machine Girl,
so it’s to be expected. Infamous di-
rector Srdjan Spasojevic’s piece (of
the un-watchable A Serbian Film)
pretty much passed me by. Weird?
Yes, violent? Yes. But it just felt like it
thought it was being cleverer than it
was (much like the detestable A Ser-
bian Film).
As the ﬁlm nears its end, the most
extreme parts appear. W (aptly enti-
tled WTF) is the most acid-trip like,
and then Y and Z hit real depravity
which for me was too far. Z, from
Yoshihiro Nishimura (of Tokyo Gore
Police fame, so it’s to be expected)
could easily cause oﬀence, although
the more easily oﬀended won’t get
this far.
I’ve seen mixed reviews for this, and
to be honest, it’s the kind of ﬁlm that
is almost pointless to review. If you
ﬁnd it over the top and in poor taste,
then what did you really expect? If it’s
too scatterbrained and plot-less, then
don’t watch a 26 part anthology! It’s
like the most twisted YouTube ses-
sion you will experience, it’s a selec-
tion of some of the most idiosyncratic
directors trying to outdo each other,
and it wears its heart on its sleeve
before tearing it up and spiting it in
your face. If you are a fan of horror
or weird (ideally both), then watch it
as it should be, with a group of mates,
and your poison of choice. It’s purely
a genre piece, and proud of it.
Shown in 26 UK theatres on the
26th April, and currently available
online on Video On Demand ser-
vices.
