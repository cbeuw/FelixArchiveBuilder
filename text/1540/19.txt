hen you see me, you
would probably guess
that I like eating. And
you couldn’t be more
right! I was lucky enough that my food
was cooked for me for most of my life.
So when I was ﬁnally let loose in the
kitchen, I have been going bonkers.
Here is some of my favourite recipes
that I have made.
Blueberry flapjack
Revising hard and need a snack? Need
something to go with your tea and get-
ting bored of Hobnobs and (choco-
late) Digestives? Here is a yummy and
healthier alternative - and it’s super
easy to make!
Ingredients:
300g Porridge Oats
150g Fresh Blueberries
200g Golden Syrup
170g Butter
4 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
Procedure:
1. Preheat oven to 180 degrees.
2. Melt butter, sugar, syrup and cinna-
mon in a saucepan.
3. Boil for a minute then remove from
heat.
4. Fold in oats until fully combined
5. Scatter blueberries into mix and stir
well.
6. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden.
Lick the pan if you wish to.
7. Leave it to cool in tin before cutting,
otherwise it will just break! But do it
before completing cool.
Scientiﬁc bonus – Oats will zap any
fatigue and blueberries can slow down
memory loss! Yummy and it might
actually help you get a better mark in
exams!
Have it with a cup of tea.
hese ﬂapjacks can be enough to
give you energy for the whole day, so
forget about lunch! What’s for dinner?
Spaghetti Bolognese
Spag Bol is a typical student food.
For me, this food is always exciting,
you just can’t get bored of it. his was
inspired by a burger recipe, but I just
make it in ball shapes.
Meatballs
500g of mince beef
1 red onion
Bits of chilli powder or actual chilli
without the seeds.
1 clove of garlic(crushed/ﬁnely
chopped)
Some coriander
1 tin of Chopped tomatoes
1) Put the beef in a pan (saves wash-
ing up!) and press it down so that it is
across the pan.
2) Put the chopped onion, chilli, garlic
and coriander in.
Aperitivo all’ Italiana!
Flapjacks, pasta and meatballs in 1!
3) Mix it up with your hand. Perfect if
you have had a stressful day....
4) Make it into balls. Don’t worry if
you have too many onions, you can
use it for the sauce!
5) Fry the leftover onions in a pan.
Brown those meatballs!
6) Add chopped tomatoes, low heat to
simmer!
7)Add anything else you want! I tend
to add a bit of chopped herbs (that
comes in a bottle) and frozen veg-
etables (which is amazing, because no
chopping and washing )
Serve with pasta that happens to be
in your cupboard. Or if you feel like a
bit of fusion, this also makes perfect
sauce for rice!
And that’s it! Give it a go and share it
with your mates!
Yes, Aperitivo all’ Italiana. he ﬁrst
oﬃcial event of the newly founded
Italian Society at Imperial! Of course,
it was food related and that is why
I was very excited about it. It took
place at a traditional Italian bar called
Da Lisa at Gloucester road and it was
indeed very Italian and also a heaven
for people who appreciate good food.
If a room full of typical Italian des-
serts, pastries, biscuits and of course
the smell of that perfect espresso
cannot be called heaven, then what
can?
he lucky people who attended the
event, had the chance to experience
the Italian culture through food and
I don’t think anyone could complain.
he “cannoli siciliani”, which is basi-
cally fried dough ﬁlled with a sweet
cream seemed absolutely divine. You
can see them in the photo below and
be jealous. Short crust pastry called
“crostatine” and a special kind of bis-
cuit called “ciambelline” were also
available. All of these were perfectly
combined with wine from South Italy

Australia Day came and went more than
two weeks ago but if, for some unfath-
omable reason, you forgot to celebrate,
fear not: ﬁnd an excuse to pay homage
to your favourite antipodeans. hese tra-
ditional Australian lamington cakes are
ideal for sharing with your loved ones,
whether it be a boyfriend or girlfriend
or your ﬂat-mates aﬄicted with the late-
night munchies.
Ingredients:
Sponge Cake:
220g caster sugar
125g butter
1tsp vanilla extract
3 eggs
220g self-raising ﬂour
120ml milk
Or (if those coursework deadlines are
just a bit too imminent and
you want your cake sooner
rather than later) just use a
light, store-bought sponge
cake and skip to step 3.
Icing:
450g icing sugar
75g cocoa powder
75g butter (melted)
100g dessicated coconut
1) First, make the sponge cake. Beat
the butter, sugar and vanilla together un-
til the mixture’s ﬂuﬀy and then add the
eggs one at a time with plenty of beating
in between.
2) Add the ﬂour and the milk a bit at a
time with plenty of stirring to make sure
it combines properly. Bake the mixture
in a 20cm square cake tin (or similar) at
180˚C for half an hour (or until a skewer
comes out clean). Turn the cake out onto
a wire rack and allow to cool completely.
3) Now to make the icing. Mix the ic-
ing sugar and cocoa well and add the
melted butter and around 75ml of boil-
ing water until you’ve got a smooth, fairly
runny consistency.
4) Slice up your cooled sponge cake
into squares or rectangles of whatever
size you please (I prefer smaller, to al-
low for a greater chocolate to sponge
ratio) and dip the squares ﬁrst
into the chocolate icing mix-
ture and then into a bowl of
dessicated coconut so that
you end up with squares of
delicious chocolately, coco-

which was very rich and fruity. he
famous Spritz was also oﬀered to the
guests and if you have never tried
it before it is highly recommended
that you do. It is basically a cocktail
served as aperitif and contains spar-
kling wine, orange liqueur and soda
and it deﬁnitely is very appetizing.
Apart from the food and the drinks,
everybody seemed to be having a
good time.
All in all, a great event that celebrat-
ed Italian cuisine and the importance
of people getting together and being
social. Well done Italian Society!
