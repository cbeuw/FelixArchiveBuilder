Leonardo Ialongo
F
A European Citizenship
In the first of two articles about our friends from across the Chan-
nel, Leonardo Ialongo lays out the case for European integration
or an outsider to European
politics, or indeed politics
in general, it can often be
diﬃcult to understand
the need for the European
Union. Of course it helped maintain
peace, but was war really possible af-
ter the atrocities of the Second World
War? Although the common market
was a good and necessary step, why do
we need such a powerful body to regu-
late and limit our national sovereignty?
Not to mention the incredible amount
of money we have to ‘donate’ to other
countries because they cannot man-
age their economy well. All reasonable
objections, except they happen to be
slightly false, or at least misguided.
he ﬁrst myth, although probably the
least controversial, is that war was not
possible after the Second World War.
his always reminds me of the famous
H. G. Wells quote “the war to end war”,
referring to the First World War. Many
in fact believed that after the horrors
of the Great War, no country would be
insane enough to once again start the
race to arms. However it did happen,
and not because Hitler was a madman,
but because the war left behind pover-
ty and resentment, sparking the rise of
nationalism once again. he ECC and
then the EU have brought countries
closer together, allowing for the sor-
rows of the war to be a shared tragedy
and responsibility. If after World War
II the Marshall Plan and the ECC had
not set the conditions for growth and
intergovernmental relation, war might
have not been such a remote possibil-
ity.
If you believe that the EU had done a
good job protecting peace, you might
still question why, for example, British
nationals have to pay higher taxes to
rescue countries that did not manage
their national budget well. Very often
in fact, when discussing the Euro-
crisis, conservative politicians in Brit-
ain, and other ‘rich’ countries such as
Germany, complain about the fact that
their taxpayers will be burdened by
other people’s faults. his is however a
slightly misguided truth, as in fact most
of this money is in the form of a loan,
and should therefore be paid back. It
is however even more baﬄing that the
citizens are frequently not aware that
Europe works both ways. It is not just
giving: all the countries receive aid and
beneﬁts as well. he diﬀerence is that it
does not go on the front page of every
newspaper. Recently he Guardian, in
an article by Simon Sweeney, listed all
the beneﬁts Britain received from the
EU. I will list just a few to stress this
point:
“ S t r u c t u r a l
funding to areas
hit by industrial
decline; restric-
tions on landﬁll
dumping; cheaper
mobile charges;
cheaper air travel;
improved consumer
protection and food
labelling; single mar-
ket competition; Eu-
rope-wide patent and
copyright protection;
freedom to travel, live
and work across Eu-
rope; funded opportuni- t i e s
for young people to undertake study or
work placements abroad; access to Eu-
ropean health services; labour protec-
tion and enhanced social welfare; holi-
day entitlement; the right not to work
more than a 48-hour week without
overtime; strongest wildlife protection
in the world; EU-funded research and
industrial collaboration; counter ter-
rorism intelligence.”
here are more, but I think these will
probably suﬃce.
he advantages Britain, and all the
other countries, receives are not lim-
ited to internal competitiveness, fund-
ing for research and infrastructure,
and improved welfare and security.
he biggest contribution is probably
in terms of in-
ternational standing and
competition. he individual European
countries are not powerful enough to
stand against giants such as China or
India; the EU however is. It is the larg-
est economy of the world, the biggest
market and the number one exporter
and importer worldwide. his could
further improve if the EU had a single
foreign policy: its inﬂuence would be
comparable if not superior to that of
the United States of America, allowing
the EU to defend even more the inter-
ests of European citizens. A united for-
eign policy and representation could
further help the European countries,
which are at the forefront of dealing
with most issues related to sustainabil-
ity and human rights, to further de-
mand the implementation of European
or similar legislation worldwide.
In confronting big challenges
such as climate change, the
European Union could be the
major player in triggering the
global reforms necessary for
safety and prosperity.
In an increasingly glo-
balised society the role of
single nations has neces-
sarily been reduced. More
European integration al-
lows for the interests and
security of European citizens to
be protected on an international stage
where single nations have lost their
inﬂuence. It would also encourage the
EU to take a ﬁrmer stand on some of
the issues that plague our word today,
such as climate change, human rights
and regional conﬂict. It further allows
greater international and inter-Euro-
pean competitiveness, strengthening
our economies and decreasing internal
tensions. he last and often less men-
tioned beneﬁt is the increased mobility
and opportunities, which encourages
the collaboration and sharing of cul-
ture and ideas.
hese are all beneﬁts which Euro-
pean countries should not forget at the
ﬁrst sign of a crisis.
Next week Leonardo will address the
issues facing a collective Europe today.
