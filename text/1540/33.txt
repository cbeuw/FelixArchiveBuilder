For lolz, cc in the Daily Mail and the
former Pope. He’s gonna be well
bored and has fuck all else to do.
eya guys!! I’m proﬀy B
Cox, and I’m here to
teach you how to be
a real life science TV
presenter. It’s so sim-
ple. Here are some tips. You could be
the next me!! :P
Stare wistfully into the
distance
Yeah, the title gave it away. Look at
all these photos I put in this article.
Looks like I’m really contemplating
life and the universe right? Well, my
trick to achieve this is to really need
a piss. hen I concentrate on not wet-
ting myself and have a steely faraway
look in my eye. Simple!
Unnecessary travel
Come on. You can’t learn about Phys-
ics in a normal place like Luton or
Slough or a BBC studio. How could I
have possibly explained about height-
ened sense of hearing when the room
is dark anywhere but an exotic cave?
It’s not like I could have just gone into
a really dark room or anything!!!
Point I’m making is that you HAVE
to travel about a bit. Manilla, LA, Ju-
piter, try and go to all of them. hen
people won’t notice that if they listen
to what you say rather than look at the
pretty pictures, you’re actually talk-
ing about dull thermodynamics. Try
to make as many tenuous analogies as
possible.
Free gap year here I come!
Get blitzed while making it
All this stuﬀ about DNA and evolu-
tion is actually pretty boring to script.
I’ve got to do like 5 takes of each little
bit too just to make sure that I say it
right. Also a monkey shat on my head
once when I was half way through a
really good take and I had to take a
shower. It was seriously not as funny
as that sounds. To combat the monot-
ony and boredom of having to do A
Level experiments on national TV you
just get really wasted and sometimes
light up a spliﬀ. I totally get away with
it too. Only a few eagle eyed viewers
ever spot that I’m oﬀ my nut.
Never do a voiceover. Even
when it would be really
useful
Got a snorkle over your mouth? Div-
ing in the sea? Skydiving? So what?
You can just attache a little mic and
have really unclear vocals. It’s more
authentic, and you’re not saying any-
thing of any importance anyway, so
who cares if you say something that’s
not audible! ;)
Use random graphics
Modern TV is great! hey have all these
amazing little graphics to use that ex-
plain everything and look pretty! I can
be talking and then a bunch of H+
ions
can ﬂoat all around me. Amazeballs
Well. hat’s it from me. You now
know how to be a top presenter. Now
have a look at some of my amazing
holiday snaps! :)
Rap lyrics of
the week
“Polo on my drawers, Polo on my
shirt
Polo on your bra bitch, that Polo,
Polo, Polo”
Rule 1 of rap is that stuff should
rhyme or there should be some
clever wordplay. This doesn’t
rhyme and saying polo repeatedly
isn’t clever wordplay, it’s just lazy
product placement. It’s actually
fun to pretend that he is just really
into mints with holes in them and
eats so many that they are stuck
to his boxers (drawers) and shirt.
He probably isn’t, but it would be
funny if he were.
Oh, and one more thing while we
are here: can rappers please take
five minutes to just look up how to
spellwords.It’snot‘hood’or‘gang-
sta’ to not spell stuff. It just makes
you look like a teenager on MSN.
