NSS - the response so far
What’s new at the Union? Find out
in our quarterly Impact Report
On 13 February we had the highest participation rate in the country for all the higher education institutions
who started the NSS on the 14 January. However, every subject needs a 50% participation rate for the data
to be used and the subjects in red have not achieved this. So, if you are a ﬁnal year who hasn’t ﬁlled it in
please go to www.thestudentsurvey.com and when ﬁlling it in remember to not be neutral.
Over the last three months, the Union has been working hard to build on
previous successes and to improve services to our members. Our latest
quarterly Impact Report shares some of the work and activity we’ve done
since November 2012 to January 2013.
This includes:
• working on a new NSS Response and updating on recommendations
from last year;
• passing a number of policies through Union Council on topics including
International Students’ Fees and Imperial Horizons;
• our President attending a trip abroad to visit Alumni in India;
• our new initiative, ‘Your Campaigns’, our callout for new campaigns; and
• launching the National Student Survey for ﬁnal years (more details about
its progress is below.
