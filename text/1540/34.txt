This week you get bored of
wearing a hat and driving
around in a pimped out golf
cart and decide to resign in
order to spend more time
watching stuff on iPlayer and
browsing Reddit. God strikes
out by smashing your house
with a lightning bolt. At least
someone give a fuck about
you I guess.
This week you go into a food
coma following pancake day.
Jittering from the volume of
lemon juice and the kilograms
of sugar you ate, you get into
College and run around like a
cocaine addict in a cocaine
factory that is hosting a club
night. Three days later you
have pancake withdrawal
symptoms. And diabetes.
This week you get slapped.
Hard. On the penis. By your
own hand. Your new wanking
technique is definitely inter-
esting. The decision to test it
out during a lecture is really a
bit weird though. “Professor,
will this be on the exam?”. A
confused asks as the front
three rows frantically scribble
down notes.
PINT? NO. FUCK YOU.
That’s it: This week you are a
massive prick. That shut you
up. Soooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooo... ... ...

Pint?
This week you get mauled to
death by a lion as you try to
recreate the BBC show Africa
in a zoo. Your story is so news-
worthy it makes the national
media, especially BBC and
ITV. Unfortunately the tributes
your family give you are that
you are a bit of a twat and that
they always thought you were
a bit dim really. Ouch
This week the pink mist where
your hand used to be – follow-
ing a particularly lonely and
depressing Valentine’s Day
– has become a major health
concern. You go to the doctors.
They keep asking for special-
ists that don’t seem relevant.
Five hours later you suspect
they’re just showing more peo-
ple your injury as it’s funny.
This week you have a weird
lecture. What you thought was
a harmless ‘practical dem-
onstration’ turns out to be a
strange display from your
lecturer. You probably should
have listened to the advice in
the email that said the first row
should bring an umbrella. Now
you have egg on your face.
Well, not exactly egg actually.
Your week: Monday: Wank
over someone fit you walked
by in SAF. Go to TigerTiger and
embarrassingly attempt to pull
anything in a 5m radius. Tues-
day: Eat wedges. Wednes-
day: Wank over someone fit
who finally accepted your
Facebook request. Thursday:
Sleep through lectures. Friday:
Wank. Weekend: Sleep.
This week you desperately
wish that people would want
to see you naked. You try
everything. You’re in a cen-
trefold, you post candid shots
on Facebook, you even email
Italian magazines with holi-
day snaps on a beach. They
politely reply with something
about some Dutch person or
some shit. Typical.
Wow. Where did you get
those jeans? And that top?
And the jacket and scarf?
You look FAAAAB. Just kid-
ding. You look like you ran
into Topcrap and just got
jizzed on by the latest ge-
neric range. Republic is go-
ing into administration. That’s
basically your fault. Feel like
shit, you already look like it.
You’re outraged when you
are just about to tuck into your
horse lasagne and you dis-
cover there is some fucking
cow in it. This is BULLSHIT.
Oh, wait, no, it’s bull dick
actually. You tuck into a nice
bit of cow wang and love the
tough, veiny, chewy texture.
Closest thing you’re getting
to oral sex this year.
This week you have to decide
between having visible horns
on your head and having to ex-
clusively drink cum as your only
source of liquid. Horns would
be good for pushing your way
to the front of a bar, but would
be a bit hideous. Cum is rich in
nutrients, but it would be hard
to explain your drink choice.
What’s it going to be?
Horsescopes – horoscopes with 100% horsemeat
