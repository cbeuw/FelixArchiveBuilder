he ﬁrst event of a year is always a
tough race, but this one was at Dorney
Lake; a well-established, ﬂat course
with beautiful smooth roads. his
short Votwo Gatorade 5k/20k/5k du-
athlon is always a good lung opener to
start your season. To make the most of
the potential for a PB, a number of Im-
perial College Triathletes drove there
in the early hours of Saturday. he
team included Alex Milne, Aimee Di-
Marco, Paul Bryant, Tom Pearson and
Hugh Mackenzie. he day dawned
bright, cold and worryingly windy.
he lake is extremely exposed and
with a course consisting of out and
back loops it meant running/cycling
directly into a head wind and then
returning with a tail wind pushing
you along. Despite my reservations, I
knew this was going to make for some
exciting racing.
he start, as always at these short
events, was rapid with people quickly
gaining 50m or so. his was no major
worry, and as the ﬁrst few kilometres
progressed the race started to unfold.
Alex, myself and a well-known duath-
lete Nick Shasha formed a front group
of three and we steadily developed a
lead pack entering T1 in 16.27. Fol-
lowing a rusty transition I came onto
the bike in second, a fair distance be-
hind Alex. However we were straight
onto the smooth tarmac around Dor-
ney Lake, and with a strong following
wind I was soon hitting 53 kph. Just
before the ﬁrst 180° turn I had caught
up with Alex, however, having not
read the course map very well I veered
oﬀ towards the ditch whilst he calmly
undertook me again. Once I had man-
aged to get round the turn I settled
into a strong rhythm, and overtook
Alex once again before setting about
building a lead. Heading into T2 an
Imperial alumnus Richard Winchester
had taken third place oﬀ Nick Shasha
so it was looking like an Imperial 123.
he run oﬀ the bike is always test-
ing, but with the following wind it felt
as if we were really ﬂying. hen we
went round the turning point into a
brick wall of head wind, my Garmin
started telling the truth and cramp set
in. However I was able to settle into a
good pace and extended my lead. Alex
also ran well consolidating his second
place, however Richard was unfor-
tunately piped in the ﬁnal stretch by
Nick for third place. Aimee DiMarco
had a strong race. having just recov-
ered from injury she powered through
to ﬁnish in 6th place. Tom Pearson
also had a notable performance com-
peting in his very ﬁrst duathlon. A
strong cycle leg pushed him up the
pack to ﬁnish in 30st place out of 173
people.
Votwo gonna do? Triathlon triumphs
BUCS points galore for ICBC in Boston
Hugh Mackenzie Sports Writer
ICBC’s high performance contin-
gent made the ever dreary trip to
Boston on Saturday 9th February
and came out with some good re-
sults, hopefully putting them in the
mixer for international selection
this year. BUCS small boats head
was also incorporated into the GB
trials, so Imperial athletes were rac-
ing for Sport Imperial glory as well!
IC’s London 2012 Olympian Mel
Wilson picked up maximum BUCS
points and finished 11th in the
Women’s trials, whilst Sport Impe-
rial stalwart Zoë Lee finished 14th
in the same race. Zoë has now been
invited to row with the GB squad at
Caversham. Helen Wood and Leon-
ora Kennedy came in 17th and 19th
respectively whilst Clio Aubugeau-
Williams came 11th of the women’s
under 23s.
Wilf Kimberley is a dab hand at
this trials business after years of
representing GB, and he was the
quickest under 23 lightweight of the
day (and 11th lightweight overall).
He also came 2nd in the BUCS rank-
ings. After Ben Spencer-Jones’ spec-
tacular Sculler’s Head performance,
pressure was on to follow it up with
another strong row in the single. He
finished 8th of the under 23 heavy-
weight men and 4th in BUCS, just
missing out on the ‘perfect’ set of
bronze BUCS medals in every boat
discipline. There is always next year
Ben! Another sculler’s head all-star
Georgie Phillips had a good row,
picking up the BUCS bronze medal.
Lightweight Myles Holborough was
the 9th placed under 23 and 6th in
BUCS. Paul Jones and Tim Richards
both struggled with illness and in-
jury coming into the trials and fin-
ished 35th and 36th respectively in
the lightweight category.
Sam Scrimgeour has been spend-
ing much of the 2012-13 season
training with the lightweight big
deals away from ICBC, but in Impe-
rial colours he finished 9th overall.
Ex-IC rowers Adam Freeman-Pask
and Jamie Kirkwood finished 2nd
and 3rd respectively. I don’t want
to take too much credit but I taught
Jamie almost everything he knows.
The evening commenced with
Captain Spencer-Jones’ 21st birth-
day bash; with embarrassing stories
and a fully stocked bar, the night
was always going to be messy. Those
who made it to Fez club in Putney
witnessed Matt Whaley’s ice cold
persona getting thrown out the win-
dow when the Baywatch theme tune
was dropped. The biggest light-up
dance floor in Europe (allegedly)
witnessed some killer moves, the
likes of which may never have been
seen outside Caius College, Cam-
bridge.
BUCS big boat head has been re-
arranged at Boston next weekend,
so the poor residents will have to
put up with Imperial stinky banter
for another weekend.
IC rowers in 2016?
