really hope that the
United Kingdom pulls
out of the European
Union and that the
Euro collapses – I
could deﬁnitely do with a cheaper
holiday somewhere nice and sunny
in Europe…” was the conclusion to a
ranting monologue I was faced with
during a taxi ride back home one
evening.
Little did this loquacious driver
know that he was talking to an Italian
whom, having being brought up in
Brussels, is a strong believer in the
economical and social beneﬁts that
the Union brings to its 27 members.
With no intention of arguing back I
got out of the cab and decided that
the slightly angering experience
might one day serve me as a funny
anecdote, representative of the
opinion of a contained minority.
Two years spent in the United
Kingdom have made me understand
that I was delusional in thinking of a
minority: even PM David Cameron
– spokesman of Britain’s population
– is proposing the exit of the United
Kingdom from the European Union.
he speech he delivered a couple of
weeks ago on the future of the United
Kingdom within the European Union
made me positively concerned: he
proposes a simple in-out referendum,
in which the decision of whether the
United Kingdom shall pull out of the
European Union lies in the hands of
the British public.
he promised referendum would
be held only if he’s voted back into
power as he claims that “a vote today
(…) would be an entirely false choice”.
He wants to give the EU enough
time to emerge from the Eurozone
crisis, allowing the UK to negotiate
a new settlement that, using Nick
Clegg’s words, would “beneﬁt us and
disadvantage everyone else”.
he depressing conclusion of it all:
the United Kingdom could well not
be part of the European Union by
2015, being the ﬁrst country to leave
the EU since its creation. What would
the UK lose and what would it gain by
renouncing its position as a member
within the European Union? Britain
hasbeenpartoftheEU’ssinglemarket
for 30 years: although it is not in the
single currency (Eurozone) and is not
part of the Schenghen Agreement
(the removal of physical borders
within the member countries), it still
beneﬁts from the free movement of
goods, capital, services and people
within the member countries. he
so called “Four Freedoms”, things
that have generally greatly beneﬁtted
Britain’s economy.
Sure, Britain likes to be “an
independent island nation” and often
feels weighed down by the at times
inﬂexible EU legislation but by being
member it takes part in all legislative
decisions, a power it would lose
once out of the EU. Europe is the
main destination of UK trade: once
out of the EU, and with the right to
the Four Freedoms lost, trade with
European countries would become
more intricate and complicated,
posing a serious economical threat
to the country.
In addition, by leaving such an
organization, the UK would be
renouncing a great amount of power
and inﬂuence in the world that it
probably wouldn’t manage to have
alone. Would the promised future
freedom actually be worth it?
hese are only a few of the
numerous issues that every elector
(including myself, as I am a British
citizen) will have to consider once
the referendum is proposed. It is
important that the future large-
scale consequences are properly
understood so as to not to solely

Allegations of Prince Charles lob-
bying MPs through private letters
refuse to go away, with the refusal
to release the text of his communi-
cations only fuelling speculation.
The latest set of revelations
concern the Prince’s enthusiasm
for the alternative treatment
‘Homeopathy’. Despite the fact
that there is no scientific evidence
for the efficacy of these treatments,
they are in some cases available
through the NHS. The government
‘NHS Choices’ website, designed
to inform the public about available
treatments, offers only indirect
criticism.
It has now emerged that a charity
set-up by Charles lobbied the
Department of Health to alter the
text of the NHS Choices guidance
on Homeopathy. The initial draft
stressed the lack of scientific
evidence, saying: “Furthermore, if
the principles of homeopathy were
true it would violate all the existing
theories of science that we make
use of today; not just our theory
of medicine, but also chemistry,
biology and physics.”
But writer David Mattin has
since resigned, stating that the
government had “sold out the NHS
Choices editorial team” and “failed
the public.”
Released documents show
someone in the department asked
Mattin’s references to a House Politics Editor
“
“Hopefully this’ll
keep those UKIP
sods off my back...”
News in brief from around the world
of Commons report stating that
Homeopathy is no more effective
than a placebo be removed as they
are “contentious” and “may well
be subject to challenge from the
Homeopathic community”.
Possibility of Talks in Syria
The leader of the opposition Syrian
National Council, Moaz al-Khatib,
is due to visit Moscow soon, amid
the possibility of talks between the
opposition leaders and the Assad
regime. It’s rumoured al-Khatib
will meet regime Foreign Minister
Walid Muallem while they are
both in the city, though Muallem
has stated that any negotiations
should take place on “Syrian Soil.”
It is hoped that the two groups
may be able to agree to talks leading
to “Free and fair parliamentary
elections”, but the issue of Assad’s
refusal to step down remains.
Meanwhile, fighting continues
across the country, with the regime
recently launching a series of
attacks on steadily encroaching
rebel forces in Damascus. The
retaliation is described as a “major
engagement”, as the government
tries to hold on to the Syrian
capital.
There is also a profound fear
that this conflict could spill
across regional borders, following
the Israeli air strike on a Syrian
‘Research Facility’ and rumours of
Iran co-ordinating with Assad’.
Violence in Bahrain
On the second anniversary of
protests against the government in
Bahrain, the streets were once again
the scene of clashes between police
and protestors.

shot to try and break up opposition
rallies and protests, following on from
the death of a protestor at the hands
of security forces.
The protests come amid the
opening of a political dialogue
between the current government and
opposition party al-Wefaq. The aim is
to turn Bahrain into a constitutional
monarchy with an elected Prime
Minister, and al-Wefaq have
demanded that the drafted reforms
be put to the people in a referendum
rather than submitted to the King for
approval.
However, a former member of the
Bahraini parliament has insisted that
talks must result in real change, as
there is a risk they will be nothing
more than a PR exercise by the
current government.
Ali Aswad warned that the
government will try to frame the
protests as minority and sectarian,
despite the fact that as much as half
of the protestors are from the Sunni
majority.
The previous protests were quashed
once they demanded democratic
reforms.
The depressing conclusion
of it all: the United Kingdom
could well not be part of the
European Union by 2015,
being the first country to leave
the EU since its creation.

To the taxi driver who might for
some odd reason be reading this
article, have you ever though that if
the United Kingdom were to leave the
European Union you might be faced
with a lack of European workers and
tourists to drive around the streets
of London, potentially losing your
biggest clientele?
