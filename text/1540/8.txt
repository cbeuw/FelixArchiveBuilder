Newitt would be interesting
Caroline Wood finally enjoys a lecture at Imperial
he annual Newitt Lecture,
hosted by the Chemical
Engineering department,
was given by Edward
Davey MP, Secretary of
State for Energy and Climate Change
on Wednesday evening. his was the
ﬁrst time that the lecture has been
given by a politician – rather than a
chemical engineer – a clear signal that
the worlds of politics, science and en-
gineering are becoming ever more en-
twined.
he title of the 2013 lecture was “he
Energy Challenge; Technology and So-
lutions”. Mr Davey’s speech addressed
key areas where engineering innova-
tions could help support economic
policies and lead to a greener economy.
Confessing that his Chemistry edu-
cation ended at O-level, albeit with
an A, Davey made no apologies about
delivering a hearty political speech to
an audience of engineers. Boldly, he set
out what he believes to be the greatest
challenge of our time: to power our
country and protect the planet.
In times of political volatility, where
world power centres are shifting (by
2035 China and India together will be
consuming 30% of the world’s energy)
he noted two key realities. he ﬁrst,
that global energy demand will con-
tinue to be met by fossil fuels well be-
yond 2035 – despite only meeting 1/3
of global energy demand overall. And
the second, that given this unpalatable
practicality, the use of unabated CO2
cannot continue.
he levels of CO2
in the atmosphere
are higher than at any point on the last
800,000 years, at least. With older re-
cords indicating that historic rises in
CO2
caused by volcanic eruptions led
to acidiﬁcation of oceans and extinc-
tion of marine wildlife the cost of not
acting to mitigate and control climate
change is too high. As Stern famously
argues, the cost now is signiﬁcant, but
is far outweighed by the long terms
costs of inaction.
Davey illustrated the complexities of
forming international climate agree-
ments, and urged the students and
professors in the audience to “not leave
it to politicians”. Davey was insistent
that the solutions to the impending
climate challenges need to be met by
a collaborative eﬀort by society, with
innovation, invention and engineering
all playing a critical role.
A pragmatic 3-pronged approach
suggested included saving energy
through improving energy eﬃciency,
lowering the cost of low carbon tech-
nologies, and investing broadly in re-
search and development. All will no
doubt be essential parts of the solution.
However, Davey more ambitiously
challenged the audience to focus their
research eﬀorts on 3 key emerging
ﬁelds: Carbon Capture and Sequestra-
tion, Energy Storage and Hydrogen.
Given the continued use of fossil fu-
els for the foreseeable future is highly
probable, improving Carbon Capture
and Sequestration techniques will be
crucial in ensuring global CO2
levels
don’t rise uncontrollably. Improved
methods of energy storage could also
be a game changer, with ﬂy-wheels,
batteries and electrolysis all noted as
areas with potential for signiﬁcant in-
novation. Hydrogen was the ﬁnal area
of research that Davey urged more
engineers to consider. If it can be com-
mercialised then hydrogen could be a
viable component of our future energy
mix.
Either way, the premise is the same.
Carbon needs to be designed out of the
power train. And there is still a huge
gap between where we are and where
we need to get to.
Davey’s ﬁnal remarks were about
how his experiences as a student led
to his interest in climate change and
the environment. He told the audience
how he extensively read books on the
subject, such as Jonathon Porritt’s See-
ing Green, and was also part of student
ecology group at Oxford university be-
fore helping transform it into to more
resolute ‘Green Action’ group.
he resounding message from this
speech was that passion and politics
alone will not be enough to address the
climate problems we are facing. here
needs to an unprecedented eﬀort from
governments, engineers, scientists and
the rest of society if we are to truly sur-
mount “the greatest challenge of our
time”.
Many thanks to William Brown and
heodor Bergstrom for organising the
event.

A lecture? Yay! We don’t get enough of those around here...
Edward Davey MP,
Secretary of State
for Energy and
Climate Change
The Newitt Lecture is an annual
event given in the name of Dudley
Newitt. Newitt was a keen Chem-
ist from a young age and although
his career was interrupted for a
number of years due to the First
World War, he later gained a Bach-
elors degree in chemistry from the
Royal College of Science – now
part of Imperial. He then went
on to do a PhD and DSc before
becoming a member of founding
committee of the British Institu-
tion for Chemical Engineers and
later being elected as president.
Newitt’s academic achieve-
ments continued, as he became a
professor of chemical engineering
and then the Head of the Depart-
ment of Chemical Engineering.
He was largely responsible for the
expansion and improvement of
the department, and also helped
to restructure the students’ union
to better facilitate overseas stu-
dents. As a result of this, he was
elected as Pro-Rector of the Col-
lege, a post he held until he retired
in 1961.
Newitt was an extraordinary
individual, advocating the use of
diversity to solve problems. With
this in mind, the topic of climate
change seemed fitting for the 2013
lecture – a challenge that needs to
be confronted not only by engi-
neers and scientists, but society
as a whole.
