ondoms have been
around for quite a while
now, allowing men all
around the world to awk-
wardly fumble and pre-
tend they know what they’re doing.
he design has actually been pretty
similar for over 50 years. he reason
being that latex condoms are cheap
and pretty easy to make, use, discard
(discretely), and are thin enough for a
transferred sensation to occur. A stag-
gering ten billion condoms were used
in 2005 (with probably only two mil-
lion being used by Silvio Berlusconi).
It’s predicted that 27 billion condoms
will be used in 2015. Suggesting that
the population is either growing rap-
idly, or just becoming a lot hornier.
Possibly a combination of both.
Every area has someone that wants
to come in and shake things up. No
pun intended there. hese have taken
many forms, from female condoms to
some slightly stranger inventions. One
guy, Jan Vinzenz Krause, invented a
spray on latex condom. he trial didn’t
go too well: all of the volunteers didn’t
want to take part once they knew what
it would involve. hat would be a pret-
ty awkward study to be part of. “So,
what, I take a tablet everyday that may
be real or a placebo and then track
how I am feeling?”. “Erm, not exactly.
Take oﬀ all your clothes while I get
the condom spraying machine”... Ill
fated tests aside, this wasn’t ever
going to be a winner. he
reason being that it took
three minutes for the
condom to dry. Maybe
I’m wrong, but I think
it may ruin the mood
a bit if you have to stop
proceedings and say: “hang
on, I’m going to spray latex on my pe-
nis and then wait for three minutes for
it to dry. Watch out, just incase the la-

Recently, as reported in a feature
in the New Scientist, two designers
have come up with what they
think is the next big thing in
condom design (oh so
many puns there).
Danny Resnic and
Ray Chavez have
decided that mak-
ing a condom with
pleasure as the focus
would make men more in-
clined to use them. hey used silicone,
not latex, and they ‘fold’ on rather
than roll on; this means there are tex-
tures and ridges, which they say make
it a hybrid condom/sex toy. hey’ve
also made the chamber where semen
is stored a lock that is one way. hey
have held a trial where volunteers
used them by themselves. You read
that right. hey gave people a con-
dom, a room, and free reign on the in-
ternet. hat’s another slightly odd and
awkward study to be included in and/
or conduct. he results were all posi-
tive, but given what they were asking
them to do, I’m fairly sure that they
would say it was okay no matter what.
Will this be the future of condoms, or
condomed to a mere curiosity?
