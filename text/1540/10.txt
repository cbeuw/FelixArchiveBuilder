FRIDAY 15 FEBRUARY

Debating in French
hile English lan-
guage debating
is already well
established as a
student activity
in British universities (such as Impe-
rial) and indeed in many universities
across the world, French language de-
bating has, until now, been completely
non-existent, even in proudly Franco-
phone institutions.
his year, however, French language
debating societies “Révolte-Toi!” have
been set up in both Paris and London
with the express intention of promot-
ing French culture and public dia-
logue. Until now, London events have
exclusively taken place far, far away, on
the distant and sombre campuses of
UCL and the LSE. Next Monday – the
18th of February, this sorry situation
is set to change – as it ﬁnally becomes
Imperial’s turn to play host to the lat-
est of these meetings, which will be
co-organised with Imperial’s French
society and will take place at 6pm in
Huxley LT145.
he workshop is designed to be ac-
cessible to everyone – regardless of
their level of French or previous expe-
rience of debating. It will consist of a
brief introduction, followed by speak-
ing games in French, and will ﬁnally
conclude with a passionate – though
hopefully friendly – debate between a
few brave souls willing to stand up and
speak in front of an audience! It will
be a perfect opportunity to practice
public speaking in French whilst dis-
cussing topics of fundamental interest
to society.
Whether you are a native French
speaker from the hip suburbs of
Paris or someone who valiantly bat-
tled through GCSE French – there is
bound to be something there to appeal
to you.
« Révolte-Toi ! » vous donne rendez-
vous lundi prochain, à 18h, dans la
salle LT145 de Huxley Building!
