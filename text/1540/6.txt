It is likely that PhD students will be get-
ting their writeup period extended to
twelve months for all Departments, it
emerged on Tuesday 12 February.
Imperial College Union Council
passed a paper that resolved to discuss
the idea with key stakeholders and to
lobby College. It was mentioned in
Council that College are already for
the idea, and so it seems unlikely to not
work.
Currently, not all students get twelve
months to write up their PhD after they
complete their experiments. Some get
six months, after which they lose access
to College and the journal subscrip-
tions. his is annoying for students and
is why it is possibly changing.

Sarah Greasley, an Imperial post-
graduate student, has received her
certiﬁcate for the new World Record.
She managed a total of 127 kisses in
the end.
he record was broken in Ethos by
the Materials postgraduate student.
She seems to be excited about the re-
cord.
Felix actually helped her by publish-
ing an article last term about the re-
cord breaking attempt.
Sarah had previously broken three
Guinness World Records: most sticky
notes on a body, most CDs ﬂipped
and caught in one minute, and most
champagne bottles opened in one
minute. She had previously attempted
the most kisses received in one min-
ute record, however the record was
discounted due to technicalities.
