Dr. Strangelove: or why I just
really love finance, not salary
ollowing last week’s ar-
ticle in Felix, and what I
perceive to be a gener-
ally anti-ﬁnance attitude
amongst Imperial under-
graduates – you may think said atti-
tude doesn’t exist, but I can assure you
I have had to defend my career choices
many times – I decided to take it upon
myself to ﬁght the corner of invest-
ment banking. If you’ve never read
Leveraged Sell Out, this will probably
be the most pro-banking piece you’ve
ever encountered.
To me, the draw to ﬁnance was
never really about money. I do agree
with Billing’s points about the cul-
ture, but I think it’s painted a little
too extreme. My own experience
within investment banking is that
while this culture of excess and liv-
ing far outside your means exists, it’s
certainly not the case for everybody. I
would say that far from people being
ridiculed for frugality as you might
imagine would happen, the most ir-
responsible spenders are sometimes
viewed in a negative light by some of
their colleagues. Sure, there’s a lot of
money ﬂying around, but in the plac-
es I know well, I can’t think of a single
person who is 10x leveraged. I have
to admit that this is likely to be more
common in the senior ranks, as peo-
ple try to maintain their three cars,
huge rent payments, private school
for their kids and so on, but certainly
for the analysts (who make up most
of the ‘culture’ of the ﬁrm you’ll re-
ally see as an intern or recent gradu-
ate), even 0.2-0.3x leverage would be
quite extreme. Many do start hitting
the credit cards as bonus season ap-
proaches, which is obviously a dread-
ful idea from the viewpoint of ﬁscal
responsibility, but this is usually as
bad as it gets. he big spenders live
lavishly, but within their (substantial)
means.
Regardless of this, I do not believe
anyone who will end up getting a
return oﬀer from their internship,
or more deﬁnitively, not get axed in
their ﬁrst two years, is driven solely
by money. When you realise at 3am
that all the assumptions driving your
model are wrong and that it’s pretty
unlikely you’re going to sleep tonight,
it’s not the thought of that bonus in a
year that keeps you going. It’s a pas-
sion for what you do, and the huge
sense of responsibility on your shoul-
ders.
One of the strongest reasons for
F
Ross Gray provides a retort to last week’s article about banking
me to pursue a ca-
reer in investment
banking is the sheer
level of responsi-
bility given to an
analyst. Let’s face
it, in every graduate
scheme you’re go-
ing to be doing the
most boring work
in the organisation
for at least two or
three years; as far
as I’m aware, there’s
no magical job that
lets you immediately
start running ac-
counts or deals, or
making important
decisions (except
your own business
of course). he dif-
ference between
banking and some
of these other jobs is
that while you may
be the bottom of the
ladder, and occa-
sionally feel under-
appreciated, you’re
still absolutely key
to the deal. It’s likely
that you built the
valuation (an im-
portant part of the
service oﬀered in
investment banking)
completely from
scratch with little help or outside in-
tervention and nobody, not even the
people more senior than you, under-
stands it as well as you do. You might
be doing the Excel work instead of
brokering the deal and being involved
in high pressure negotiations, but this
work is still absolutely critical to the
deal closing. If your model is wrong
somehow on a live deal, this could not
only lead to the complete collapse of
the deal but potential lawsuits and
scandals. I can’t think of many other
career paths where someone could
derail a transaction worth billions of
dollars in their ﬁrst year.
I think a common problem for
those trying to consider the mindset
of those of us who choose this career
path is that they don’t understand
that to us, this is not boring. I can’t
speak for every undergraduate with
an internship, but I can assure you,
mergers and acquisitions, leveraged
buy outs, hostile takeovers and issues
of corporate governance are inﬁnitely
more interesting to me than plasma
physics or synthetic chemistry.
I didn’t have my heart set on phys-
ics then get to university and think
“Wait, instead of doing something I
love for not very much money, I can
do something I absolutely despise for
100 hours a week for a good salary and
a hefty bonus? Sign me up!” To me,
the reasons to do banking seem anal-
ogous to those for coming to Impe-
rial. Why did most people come here
speciﬁcally, instead of, say, a slightly
less respected university where they
wouldn’t be worked to death? We
want to learn as much as possible. We
want the best exit opportunities after-
wards. Why are we willing to work so
intensely to achieve these goals? Per-
haps it’s because regardless of where
we’re going afterwards, most of us are
still, or were at some stage, incredibly
passionate about our subject. Perhaps
we just love working hard in general.
So next time you go to ridicule your
friend for being a sell-out when they
text you from their desk at 5am, think
through why they might be there.
Nobody is claiming that ﬁnance is
some magical land where you’ll be
perpetually happy and there are no
problems at all. Every path has its
diﬃculties and its victories, and in
ﬁnance these moments tend to be
rather bipolar, with the worst mo-
ments being utterly dreadful, but
the best moments being some of the
most satisfying I have experienced. At
the very core of it, that’s why, despite
rarely leaving the oﬃce before 1am,
being perpetually tired, often ill, and
sometimes a little downtrodden, I still
remain passionate about investment
banking and look forward to starting
my full time job in the summer. If you
can’t understand this at all, then fol-
low Mr. Billing’s advice: please do not
go into ﬁnance, you will hate it. But if
this means anything to you, if in some
weird way you love it when you’re
forced to pull an all-nighter for a lab
report, then forget the money and put
some serious consideration into a ca-
reer in ﬁnance.

going
