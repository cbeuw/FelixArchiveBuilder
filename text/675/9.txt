Photosoc
It will soon be the summer
vacation and many students will
be going off to the four (or is it
seven or fifteen or something)
corners of the (spherical) world.
If you are one of these people
then don't forget to take a camera
with you, so that when you come
back in October you will be able
to enter our second staff/student
photographic competition. This
will probably be held in the third
week of term. Each side will
choose its best ten photographs
before the competition. Full
details will be in our next
newsletter and probably in the
first or second F E L I X of next
term.
The minimum size for black
and white prints will be 61
/2 "x81
/2 "
(although 10x8 and larger sizes
will be prefcred), that for colour
prints will be 5"x7" and colour
slides must be 35mm.
The theme of the competition
will probably be 'open' (ie we will
accept anything) but if there is1
enough interest we might have a
'macro' section as well.
Don't be put off if you are not
going anywhere very interesting
though. Even if you are only
going to Spain or, more sensibly,
• spending the whole vacation at
home (I wish I was), there should
be countless opportunities to
take some really whizzo pickies.
So bring them along in October
so that we can really wipe the
floor with the staff photosoc this
time.
Rag
Firstly, thanks to everybody who
contributed to Rag Fete last
week, whether it was by setting
stalls up, clearing up afterwards
.or just simply coming along and
spending money. I'm not entirely
sure of the proceeds yet, but they
ate in the region of £850—about
£200 up on last year.
Secondly, with this year's fund
raising over, we need people to
run Rag next year. Elections for
the posts of Rag Treasurer,
Secretary, Publicity Officer and
any other positions I can dream
up will be held at the Rag
Committee meeting on 31 May at
12:45pm in the U D H . I will be
pleased to pass on details to
anybody interested.
Christian Union
We hope, when Luis Palau comes
to London to talk to us about the
Gospel of Jesus Christ, that we
should not curl up and hide in our
shells but that we should all be
willing to go and listen to him.
Luis Palau says that there is a
God. If he is wrong and we ignore
him then we have lost nothing but
if he is right and we ignore him
then we turn down the chance of
obtaining what he says G o d is
offering us, eternal life. If we
listen to him, whether he is right
or wrong, then we can decide for
ourselves if he has been misled.
- Luis Palau will be speaking at
Queen's Park Rangers Stadium
from 31 May to 30 June, Monday
to Saturday at 8:00pm. A l l you
have to do is to go and listen,
either alone or accepting our
invitation to come with us. A l l it
will cost you will be vour travel
there and your travel back. Below
is a map of how to get there.
Shepherd's Bush is on the
Metropolitan and Central Lines.
Goldhawk Road is on the
Metropolitan Line.
