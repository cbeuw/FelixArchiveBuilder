Apartheid
Ambassador
Dear Editor
The Conservative Society
will, we're sure, be only too
eager to invite the S A
Ambassador to College under
the banner of 'free speech for
all'. However, we must ask
ourselves, would we have the
freedom to speak out against
Apartheid in his country? In the
U K 'freedom' is supposed to be
a right given to those who do
not abuse it—if a government
actually exists by virtue of a
systematically evil law, which is
all about denying 'freedom' to
the majority, then we do not
believe we should be providing
a platform for its representa-
tives. We don't suppose Con
Soc would invite spokespersons
for the Polish, Iranian 01
Libyan governments (to namt
but a few!) to speak here.
If the Con Soc is so
concerned about 'free speech'
perhaps they might also invite
Steve Kitson (recently released
from a SA jail after serving a
horrendous sentence) to speak
about the struggle of the black
peoples in Southern Africa
against the oppression of a
crushingly brutal regime. We
think that if Con Soc go ahead
with this invitation, it will
expose the double standards
that they apply—ie some people
(the wealthy) are more entitled
to freedom than others.
Yours etc

Dear Pallab
Your report in last week's
editorial gave-the impression
that Con Soc were in the
process of inviting the South
African Ambassador to address
the society. Nothing could be
further from the truth. At a
recent Committee meeting to
plan next year's events, the idea
of the invitation was raised,
particularly appropriate in the
light of the case of Zola Budd,
the imminent visit of M r Botha,
and the atrocities taking place
in Africa as Cuban-backed
insurgents massacre innocent
civilians in the cause of Soviet
hegemony. While in no way
condoning apartheid, I feel that
a College such as Imperial, with
its strong African connections,
should provide a platform to
someone denied it elsewhere.
Yours

In the beginning was the
toilet graffiti.
Why does A Causebrook
doubt his own fine talents to
pen his worth and stir the
murky waters of IC?
I would rather have a wank
outside the American Embassy
than blow my horn under the
deaf ears of a few sleepy
students.
A Causebrook you have my
persmission to stand on my
shoulders.
Thumbs up the squad.

Senseless
Behaviour
Dear Pallab
Having just witnessed the
RCS initiations ceremony I feel
that the time has come to curtail
such stupid and pointless
practices. There may well be
historical reasons for these
barbaric habits, but each year
they seem to get progressively
worse. Rotting fish guts, eight
week old milk and decaying
octopus cannot any longer be
regarded as funny things to
pour over people. Surely no one
would want the initiates to
become seriously ill and it
seems to me that they may well
do. If they do not catch some
parasitic disease from the
rotting debris then following up
with a Round Pound dip must
be seen as an attempt to assume
that they end up being the worse
for wear.
I myself following one such
stupid event managed to catch a
urinary infection, cystitis and a
kidney infection, and I would
not recommend this to any-
body. I hope that someone will
have the sense to stop this
senseless behaviour.
Newman Ban
Dear Pallab
As the members of the
committee, formed to hear
Michael Newman's appeal
against the disciplinary action
taken by the Executive of
Imperial College Student
Union, may we acquire some
space in your journal to explain
our decision and clear up any
misconceived ideas that may
have arisen over this matter.
Mr Newman admitted to
defacing two pages of the
R S M U Newsletter due for
publication before the Mines
Review. He also agreed that he
was uncooperative in locating
these 'alterations' when asked
to do so. The Executive meeting
of 21 M a r c h d e c i d e d ,
unanimously, to ban M r
Newman from the Union
Building for two months from
5:30pm, 23 March. He was
informed of this and h is right of
appeal by letter. We understand
he was also banned by you from
the F E L I X Office and charged
a sum of approximately £16 for
reprinting costs of the defaced
articles. M r Newman did not
appeal against the Executive
decision until 9 May, although
according to Union Disciplin-
ary Procedure, he should have
done so within fourteen days of
notification. We felt however
that as much of this time fell in
the Easter vacation he should
be allowed to continue his
appeal.
After hearing statements
from Gaynor Lewis, Chris
Griffin ( R S M U Newsletter
editor), yourself and M r
Newman, this committee were
u n a n i m o u s i n that the
Executive were correct in their
decision and that disciplinary
procedure had been correctly
followed.
M r N e w m a n was not
prevented from voting at either
the U G M or SCC meetings and
could have made statements at
either, by proxy, if he so wished.
This committee did make a
further statement to the fact
that in future disciplinary cases
both complainant and plaintiff
be invited to produce writte'n
statements before the Executive
meeting and informed in
writing of the date and time of
the said meeting.
I hope this explanation of our
decision will put M r Martin's
mind at rest and that M r
Newman was given a fair
hearing by an independent
body, chosen at random, from
Imperial College Student
Union Council.
He may also wish to be
informed that at the appeals
committee M r Newman refused
to give an assurance that should
such an opportunity arise
again, he would not commit a
similar act.
Yours sincerely

Southey, J Claydon, P Burt

appeals committee but was
unable to be contacted in time

Dear Sir
Estates have done it again. In
spending College money on
wonderful technological key-
card doors for Southside halls
of residence they have
overlooked the fact that it won't
help...the problem in Southside
is that anyone prepared to wait
five minutes will be let in by a
resident. Whether they're let in
through one set of doors or two
doesn't seem that important.
I've been let in at 3:30am by a
security guard who doesn't
know me before know, without
a word—let alone a request for
ID. As long as people in
Southside continue to let
strangers in without asking
them for Unioncards (for
example), security in Southside
will continue to be non-existent.
I don't know how to improve
this, but spending £??? on a new
set of doors won't help.
Alongside this, the fact that
the doors are so cheap they
don't close properly, and can
thus be shoved open when they
are 'latched' shut, doesn't seem
to matter much...
