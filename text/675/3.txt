Levi it out,
John
UGM Sketch
There are General Meetings, and
there are Annual General
Meetings. Sadly both are
generally less than rivetting and
stitches of laughter are an all too
rare sight. It was with this in mind
and the prospect of three Shock
Horror Probe Physics exams in
the 27 hours before yesterday's
A G M that the farewell sketch
was prepared in advance. This
caused few problems as the
Sketch has a well-established set
of guidelines for such an
emergency, ie write about
nothing in particular, explain at
great length why it is that the
sketch-writer finds himself
having to write about nothing in
particular at great length, dole
out a few awards and tell you
what the people who normally
appear in the Sketch were doing
for the rest of the week, at the Rag
Fete for instance.
Unfortunately I missed Lady
Mary opening the fete but by all
accounts she was on fine form
and suitably sympathetic when
someone flanned Gaynor as she
was standing next to the good
lady trying to get a word in
edgeways.
Sporting stalls were prominent
but the level of competence and
know-how low—competitors
gave flawless impersonations of
England's bowlers by failing to
hit the wicket once in all the time
I watched the cricket stall; one
viewer, as he watched the cup
final on the psychedelic video
screen, voiced his incredulity that
Everton's Neville Southall has
never played for England
(Southall is ruled out on two
counts of course—being Welsh
and a rather good keeper to boot)
and Sean Davis fumbled what
was possibly the only clean pass
in a neanderthal game of rugby
on the Queen's Lawn. It was a
bad day all round for Davis as he
had earlier been comprehensively
beaten by this writer at the
'Sucking Jelly through a Straw'
stall.
Star of the rugby, playing
scrum-half and agent provocateur,
was G u i l d s President-elect
Mirabel Anderson . Sporting
what is currently one of the best
haircuts in College and variously
dressed in a pink bin-liner,
Maribel Anderson and Mike Stuart.
fencing mask and a T-shirt saying
'I'm working on it' Maribel was in
fact star of the afternoon—
shaving Mike Stuart's head,
being a victim in the stocks,
flanning people and seemingly
being beneath the posts, under
the table and behind the scrum all
at the same time.
Running her a close second
was the fire-eater/flame-thrower
who indulged in this spectacular
and risky business behind a cool
pair of shades (an obscure little
opthalmic/celluloid reference
there). O t h e r successful
attractions were the Queens
Tower for which people were
prepared to queue for over an
hour and the afore-mentioned
head-shrinking which raised over
£300. Afterwards Stuart was seen
tempting fate walking around in
a fez and being screen-tested for a
remake of The King and I.
Hopefully anything scan-
dalous that did happen at
yesterday's A G M is reported
elsewhere and before taking my
leave I would like to take this
opportunity to scotch (shurely
shome mishtake—sic, in, etc)
rumours that despite efforts to
introduce drier humour into
F E L I X and generally make the
paper a little cleaner this column
will not be retitled the U G M
Sketchleys.

The Chemical Engineering
department has been given two
million pounds worth of
computing hardware, software
and back up by IBM. The deal is
part of an I B M promotion to
increase the use of their systems
in universities.
The department are to receive
an IBM 4341, which is the top of
their super mini range. This will
be coupled with a Series 1
computer to control the pilot
plant. In addition there will be
forty colour graphics terminals
for teaching purposes. I B M will
also supply some control
software and the wages of two
programmers for three years.
The aim of the project from
IBM's point of view is that
several chemical engineering
departments including Imperial's
will develop experience in
teaching on IBM equipment. It is
expected that the department will
be used as a showpiece by the
c o m p a n y . H o w e v e r the
department has signed no formal
agreement to provide software to
IBM and the company described
the deal as part of their effort to
be good corporate citizens.
The equipment will be
delivered in the summer and used
primarily by undergraduates.

The Union will get a 3.8% increase in its subvention from College for
next session, it was agreed recently. In addition an extra £6,500 will be
provided to cover expenses involved with joining the University
Athletics Union.
The total to be received from College will rise from £214,120 to
£228,750. This leaves a shortfall between income and estimated
expenditure next year of some £7,000, but a surplus from the present
year is expected to cover some of this. It is also expected that the
Union's income from other sources can be booked to cover any
shortfall.
