What price

^mocracy?
In December 1974, South
Africa was saved from expulsion
from' the United Nations by the
vetoes of France, the United
Kingdom and the United States
of America, permit me to put
forward a tentative reason for
their action. Could it have been
that, since these three countries
are all democratic countries, they
believed all attempts at
interference in internal South
African democracy to be highly
deplorable? It would seem
probable then, that the reason for
their action (or inaction) was that
democracy, even South African
democracy, ought to be
preserved.
Demi-God
democracy
Was it not for such reason that
the U K invaded the Falkland
Islands, and the USA, Grenada,
and the French, Chad? With all
this Evidence of subservience to
the demi-God democracy, it is a
bit confusing to find no evidence
of these powers having sent a task
force to South Africa. Before I
continue, please allow me to
quote Toivo Herman Ja Toivo,
one of the founders of SWAPO
(South West Africa Peoples
Organisation):
"Only when we are granted our
independence will the struggle
stop. Only when our human
dignity is restored to us, as equals
of the whites, will there be peace
between us.
"We believe that South Africa
has a choiceâ€”either to live at
peace with us, or to subdue us by
force. If you choose to crush us
and impose your will on us, then
you not only betray your trust,
but you will live in security only
so long as your power is greater
than ours. No South African will
live in peace in South West
Africa, for each will know that
his security is based on force, and
that without force he will face
ejection by the people of South
West Africa.
"My co-accused and I have
suffered, we are not looking
forward to our imprisonment.
We do not however feel that our
efforts and sacrifice have been
wasted. We believe that human
In view of the proposed visit to Britain of the South
African Prime Minister Mr P W Botha, at the
invitation of the British Government, E M Ugoala
expresses a few thoughts regarding South Africa,
Namibia (originally South West Africa) and the
international community (with particular reference to
those few countries who dominate it).
suffering has its effect on those
who impose it. We hope that
what has happened will persuade
the whites of South Africa that
we and the world may be right
and they may be wrong. Only
when white South Africans
realise this and act on it will it be
possible for us to stop our
struggle for freedom and justice
in the land of our birth."
Your silence on this great
injustice perpetrated upon people
living in the land of their birth, is
so deafening that it must amount
to complicity, a few countries
have withdrawn the support of
their government for their
national companies working in
South Africa. Notably, the U K
government was not among
these. In 1968 t i e U K
government gave the British Rio
Tinto Zinco Company its
blessing to develop the Rossing
uranium mine, and agreed a
contract for the U K A E A to be
supplied with uranium from the
mine. Despite the labour
opposition promise, in 1973, to
end this contract if re-elected,
nothing happened, but most
astonishingly, the U K took the
u n p r e c e n d e n t e d step o f
disagreeing with the Interna-
tional Court of Justice when, in
1971, it p r o c l a i m e d the
occupation of Namibia by South
Africa to be wholly illegal.

Ja Toivo was jailed for 20 years
in South Africa's infamous
prison on Robben Island with no
remission. The extract from his
speech at his 'conviction' shows
his deep commitment to human
values and his humanity. His
crime was membership of
SWAPO, which was not then,
and is not now an organisation
proscribed by the South African
administration.

cooperation (yes, even between
communists and capitalists,
homosexuals and heterosexuals,
and men and women of all races
and creeds) for humanity to have
reached the situation of having
substantially eradicated the
cancer of smallpox, yellow fever,
apartheid
cancer
bubonic plague and malaria.
Over a period of less than 30
years.
What then of the cancer that is
apartheid? How have we reacted
to the treatment of this disease
which is so much more localised
(and thus should be easier to
treat), than smallpox was 50
years ago? Rather than do
anything, we go to the United
Nations along with our French
and American colleagues. In
order to use our veto to block any
anti-South African resolutions
that anyone might make. Perhaps
that is the reason that U K ,
America, France and Russia did
not bother with resolutions at the
U N before respectively launching
invasions on the Falklands,
Grenada, Chad and Afghanistan.
Anyone who saw the T V
program 'Third Eye' (Monday 14

Namibia will have noted that two
South African soldiers, found
guilty of roasting a black
Namibian alive, and thus
maiming him for life (the man
had protested when he found the
soldiers raping his wife), were
fined one quarter of what they
would have been fined had they

Maybe it is because the black

Africans are not white, and
cuddly....like the Canadian seals.

about the role of the U K in
probably the most repressive
system in the world, South
Africa, and complain. They will
listen, if enough of you care
enough to write and let them
know your feelings. IF you do
not, then you are using your
'veto' in precisely the same
manner that the B r i t i s h
ambassador to the U N has done
many times before, to keep the
black people in South Africa and
Namibia enslaved, and not only
to South Africa, but to yourselves
as well, since you profit from the
fruit of their slavery. Another
thing that students and young
people in particular might find
very easy to do, would be to
refrain from buying sports goods
manufactured by the 'Adidas'
company which unequivocally
supports the apartheid system in
South Africa.
