John Wayne did it; Clint Eastwood does it; it's not justfor the
pony-club girls! Would you like to take up riding?
Mention riding and you will
immediately conjure up visions of
fourteen-year old girls with pony
tails and rich parents. But it's not
like that at IC Riding Club. First
of all, riding isn't very expensive
because of the discounts the club
arrange, and secondly, riding
c a t e r s for a l l levels of
involvement, from relaxing, get-
away-from-it-all hobby to fierce
competition, for all levels of
experience, for men and women.
How do you get started?
Riding is something that
anyone can take up at any any
age from three to sixty-three.
Lessons are essential at the
beginning. No matter how good
you become there is always room
for i m p r o v e m e n t , e v e n
experienced riders have lessons
occasionally. Riding is a bit like
learning to drive—the aim is to be
able to completely control any
horse. Horses, in turn, are
schooled to understand and
obey any rider. The beginner has
to learn to get on and off, stop
and go, and then change gear
(walk, trot, canter, gallop).
A l t h o u g h reversing r o u n d
corners and hill starts are
possible (but silly!), three point
turns are unnecessary! Y o u
don't have to be Evel Knievel to
start jumping, and the ultimate
expression of control is dressage
(ballet for horses).
Riding Club use a school in
P e t t ' s W o o d w h i c h they
recommend for beginners,
simply because a good technical
introduction to riding is offered.
As a member, lessons are £2.40
an hour. Don't be put off by the
idea that you will need expensive
riding gear—you won't. It's only
really important what goes on
your head and feet. If you don't
have a riding hat, your school will
lend you one to begin with—they
cost £16 new and can often be
obtained secondhand. You must
wear 'sensible' shoes with a low
heel. Something with no heel
could allow your ankle to slip
through the stirrup in an
accident, and then you could be
dragged along the ground at a
gallop. American-style cowboy
boots ar fine. Moulded rubber
riding boots are £9, and a good
buy for the beginner. Wear what
you like elsewhere, as long as it is
comfortable. Tight jeans will not
only pinch, but may split! Your
school may ask you to get your
own riding whip—even if you
never intend to use it—because it
helps you to hold your hands
correctly.
The prospect of falling off is
quite discouraging, but it
happens rarely (unless you take
up jumping, when it happens a
lot). It is only likely if something
disturbs the horse. Beginners
usually get the quietest horses,
so don't worry but always wear a
hat and correct footwear just in
case.

FELIX\
When you can ride a bit, walk,
trot and canter, you can go on
one of the club's 'Fun Rides', and
this is where I came in. Despite
the fact that I have only been on a
horse twice since age eight, and
both these occasions were long
ago, I agreed to go with the club
to Wimbledon for a hack on
Wimbledon Common. In case
you've forgotten Hack in this
context means a recreational
journey on horseback and has
nothing to d o with I C U
committee meetings! Instead,
you spend an hour admiring the
scenery and humming Mike
Oldfield's Horse Song. Horses
are surprising for two reasons:
they are very much taller than
you expect, and they are not very
clever. They are content to
follow the horse in front, unless
they get the idea that there might
be a race, and then they are liable
to take off at a gallop. But they
are smart enough to realise when
a rider is not in control, and then
they take advantage by suddenly
throwing their heads down.
Although my horse was the
sweetest, most gentle and
obedient in the stable, the aptly
named Velvet, I had great
difficulty keeping it under
control. Apart from wishing I
knew what the horse was
thinking, I enjoyed the hack
immensely—the two worst
moments were getting on ('Me?
Up there? Y o u must be joking!')
and getting off again ('Can I have
a ladder?'). I was especially
worried that the horse would bolt
during the (rather long) time I
took to get off. And afterwards?
First, the hunger, then the feeling
that my knees were coming
apart, which gradually subsided
into aching leg muscles. It took a
week to get over it.!
Competitions
There are two teams which
c o m p e t e in i n t e r - c o l l e g e
University of London events, a
novice dressage competition and
a 3ft jumping course. IC ' A ' team
came third this year and two
Friday, May 25,
Rosemary
on Trigger
riders were placed in the
University of London top ten.
Team trials are held in the first
two weeks of next term and there
will be special lessons for team
members.
Holidays
The club recently had a very
successful holiday weekend in
Cornwall. The price was £40 for
travel, food and board and about
eight hours' riding. This holiday
will be repeated next year, and
there will also be a weekend
introductory course on cross
country at a point to point racing
stables in Lincolnshire. T o get
the most ouit of these holidays,
you really need to be fit and
experienced.
Social
The club organise a day trip to
the University Championship in
October and another to Olympia
at Christmas. Tuesday lunch
time meetings in the Southside
Upper Lounge allow members to
plan informal outings to stables
for lessons and hacks. The
annual dinner was such a
success that it is planned to make
it a termly dinner!
And finally
Riding club offers a range of
riding activities, a good social life
and an above average proportion
of women members! But its is
also about horses—they are not
machines, and they have soft
velevety noses and melting
brown eyes. They make a
welcome change from tubes,
buses, cars, computers and
Imperial College.
