The alternative
(and shorter) annual repo
You may have seen a copy of the detailed annual reports
of Union officers presented at yesterday's AGM, with
particularly long contributions from the sabbatical
officers. These reports are essentially an inside and
rather personal view of the Union's year, so it seems
appropriate for FELIX, which is charged with providing
an independent voice within the Union, to take a step
back and analyse the year from an objective point of
view.
Notable Successes
The year has been marked by a
few notable successes, mainly in
the field of services. The most
important of these is the
acquisition of the U n i o n
refectory but also worthy of note
are reduced bar prices, the new
travel office, and the opening of a
separate regalia/sports shop. The
credit for these successes goes
mainly to Christine Teller.
Christine is certainly the most
competent and experienced
sabbatical officer I C U has had
for at least five years. Her
departure from College will be a
great loss to the Union, in which
she has played a major role for
over three years. Unfortunately
the only person to have more
confidence in her abilities than
the author is Christine herself.
She has tended to become
unapproachable and unwilling to
listen to the views of those.
outside an inner circle of hacks,
often taking the view that she
knows best what is good for
students without bothering to ask
first. Despite these shortcomings
she will undoubtedly be a hard
act to follow.
Disappointment
Among all Union members,
hacks and others, it is hard to find
anyone who isn't disapponted
with the performance of Gaynor
Lewis as Union President. She
has, it is true, carried out her
duties with some degree of
competence, but that is the end of
her achievement. There has been
no leadership, no initiative and
no imagination to raise her role
a b o v e t h a t o f a mere
administrator. Worse still, she
(like Christine) has often seemed
to have scant regard for the views
of Union members, prefering to
make decisions by 'Presidential
, decree' than by the proper Union
policy making procedure.
In her annual report she
complains of alleged inaccuracies
in F E L I X over the year which she
has 'had to continually correct'.
It is unclear to whom she has
corrected them. It certainly
wasn't F E L I X , and it wasn't the
Union membership either. She
may have had to 'correct' the
impression that some College

administrators had got from
F E L I X that most IC students are
dissatisifed with many College
decisions and the manner in
which their views are ignored by
the Union.
Further Consolidation
The year has unfortunately seen a
further consolidation of the trend
started in 1980/1 towards
allowing the Union to become a
branch of the extended College
administration. The recent
episode of telephone facilities for
IC Radio and STOIC has
demonstrated this perfectly.
Instead of defending student
interests and preventing the
cutting by College of an essential
facility for the student media,
ICU (or more precisely its
President) has, on the slightest
p r o m p t i n g f r o m C o l l e g e ,
enforced its removal without
even token consultation with
those directly involved.
The reason for this is becoming
clear to a number of frustrated
Union officers outside the 'inner
circle' who find it impossible to
play their proper role in Union
. decision making. Whilst Gaynor
Lewis and Christine Teller are
supposedly representing IC
students at College committees in
fact they only represent
themselves and their close
associates. When was the last
time the President referred a
matter of policy to the sovereign
body of the Union, a general
meeting? No wonder few people
attend U G M s when all they can
expect from Gaynor is a list of

things she has already done and
decisions she has already taken.
She has reduced the role of a
U G M to that of a last Court of
Appeal where her decisions can
be challenged by those who
oppose them. If they have been
lucky enough to discover in time
what decisions have been made,
that is.
UGM Trivia
Without any doubt the most
important decisions in this Union
are being taken by the President
after minimal consultation with
her self-appointed advisers. Less
important decisions are taken by
the Executive, and Council,
largely t h r o u g h its o w n
ineptitude, is able to decide only
on matters of little real
significance. At the bottom of
this process, U G M s are left with
little to concern them but the
trivia that has been a feature of
this and previous sessions.
The feeling that this situation is
the very reverse of what it should
be is growing amongst many of
those involved in the Union as
well as the majority of Union
m e m b e r s w h o are m o r e
disaffected with their Union than
ever. Looking at next year's
leadership gives little optimism
for a fundamental change of
attitude. The Union 'system' has
largely seen to that. What is
perhaps needed is a significant
change in the power balance
within ICU; there is at least some
optimism that this long-overdue
reform will become a reality next
