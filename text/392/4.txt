T H E R E J E C T I O N of the Alternative Prospectus by the
A d m i s s i o n s P o l i c y Committee by 7 votes t o 6, with seven
abstentions w a s a major disappointment for u s . Many of us
believe that such a publication w i l l be to the advantage of
both the C o l l e g e a s a whole and the U n i o n in particular.
We initiated the development for a series of reasons. One
is that we believe that there is a genuine a n d widespread
demand for a " s t u d e n t ' s - e y e - v i e w " of the C o l l e g e , particularly
amongst prospective students. T h e College prospectus provides
the necessary factual and historical background to life at I C .
There is general agreement that it lacks something in s t y l e ; w e
have been a s k e d , and are very w i l l i n g to help in revamping the
the C o l lege prospectus.
However the " A l t e r n a t i v e " prospectus provides a necessary
supplement to t h i s . There is much evidence that sixth-formers
are increasingly c y n i c a l about the value of higher education,
and judging by the drift t o the p o l y t e c h n i c s , about university
education in particular. T h e Manchester and Cambridge student
prospectuses clearly managed to overcome this c y n i c i u m in a
way that no C o l l e g e or U n i v e r s i t y prospectus, however w e l l -
written and presented ever c o u l d .
The crux of the matter lies in the prospective student's
perception of the C o l l e g e . Rightly or wrongly, (I think rightly)
he feels that the only true and accurate indication of life at IC
w i l l come from students themselves. T h i s , o f course, i s why w e
students take them around in interview groups. T h i s i s a l s o
why the Alternative Prospectuses have had s u c h an impact on
sixth-formers.
The Alternative Prospectus i s not a g i m m i c K . Nor i s it a n
attempt to indulge in a n orgy of c r i t i c i s m o f particular aspects of
the C o l l e g e . We would like to present a n honest and balanced
student view, and to that e n d , w e would want to spread the
authorship a s far as p o s s i b l e . I would expect, in the e n d , that
over 150 people w i l l have contributed, including year reps,
union officers, and even " a v e r a g e s t u d e n t s . "
We are a s concerned a s anyone about the decline in student
numbers. T h e Union's income depends on keeping those numbers
up. I think that the fears of a number of academics may be
allayed if they were to have a few words with their colleagues
in other institutions.where student prospectuses have been
introduced.

The defeat of Leeds United in the European C u p F i n a l ,
tragic as it w a s , is probably significant in the context of the
E E C referendum. T h e Yorkshiremen worked hard, s k i l f u l l y a n d
w e l l and at the end had nothing to show for i t . T h e Munich
team, contributed little to the game — except two goals, and at
the e n d , took the C u p and a l l the T V coverage. What reason d i d
the commentators give for the Bayer Munich w i n ? T h e b i g money
spent to bring a new coach from the United States.
Never mind. T h e World C u p comes next and I have every
confidence in D o n R e v i e , provided he doesn't play A l a n B a l l ,
nor Norman Hunter. (Fascist pig! — Ed.).
The referendum is next T h u r s d a y .
