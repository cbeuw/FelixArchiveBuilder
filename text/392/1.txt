DON'T RAISE
OUR FEES!
A P E A C E F U L PICKET of a meeting of the Imperial College Board of Governors took
place last Friday morning. The picket was in protest against the Government Proposals
(to raise .the undergraduate and postgraduate tuition fees by £70) which the Governing
Body was being asked to ratify.
About fifteen people took
part In the protest which w a s
organised by the Overseas
Students Committee to highlight
the particular plight of those
students who have come from
abroad to study here and are
now being forced to pay £330
per s e s s i o n (both undergraduates
pay just £165 and P . G . ' s £155.
A letter was presented to
Sir Henry F i s h e r , the Governing
Body Chairman, outlining the
difficulties in which many of
the overseas students a t IC
now find themselves. (The
letter is reprinted below).
In h i s reply to the letter on
behalf of the Governing Body,
the R e c t o r said that the
Governors "gave lengthy and
sympathetic consideration" to
the points which had been
raised but they neveretheless
"felt it necessary to implement
the increase in fees for 1975-
76 as recommended by the
Secretary of State tor Education
and Science".
The Rector further expla ined
" i t this income (from the
increased fees) is not obtained,
then the College may be forced
to review its planned expendi-
ture, perhaps having to make
undesirable cuts in its services
or facilities. I am sure that
this would be unwelcome both
to staff and students,..."
The C o l l e g e has, however,
been given f a c i l i t i e s to enable
the extra fees to be remitted,
in whole or in part, for such
students for whom the increases
have caused financial hardship.
Students in this position
should obtain application forms
from Mr J - B e v a n in Room 344,
the Sherfield B u i l d i n g . In
The picket line outside the Rector's residence.
Weeks H a l l
W E E K S H A L L is to accommod-
ate staff and students over the
summer and will return to full
use as a hall of residence next
session.
T h i s announcement, which
was made a t last F r i d a y ' s meet-
ing of the Governing B o d y ' s
finance and executive commit-
tee, stated that contractual
work w i l l have to be carried
out probably next summer i n
order to reinforce the building,
but in the meantime the h a l l c a n
be regarded as safe s o long as
the safety regulations are a d -
hered t o .
Bike Thefts
TWO RACING bicycles, both of
which were secured by a chain,
have recently been stolen.
The first b i k e , a purple P u c h
Prima belonging to J . Champ, a
Biochem U G , w a s taken on
Thursday, M a y 15th at about
3.1 5 pm i n F u l h a m R o a d near
E v e l y n Gardens.
The other, a very expensive
yellow Holdsworth belonging
to J . . Cavanagh of Botany 1,
was taken from near the Sher-
field B u i l d i n g main entrance by
the stairs between 3 3 0 a n d
6.30 pm on Tuesday, May 20th.
Anyone spotting either of
of these two b i c y c l e s should
contact either the police or the
above named owner.
the words of the Rector, "all
such applications will be given
the most sympathetic
consideration".
W h e n a s k e d f o r h i s
comments, Mr C h r i s Kourounio-
tis, the C h a i r m a n of the
Overseas Students Committee
s a i d "The Rector's reply to
our letter was very unsatis-
factory. The seriousness of the
effects of a decision not to
Implement the increase to the
College's financial position Is
doubtful. According to the
Union's information, the
difference would be about
£50,000 per annum, an amount
which cannot seriously
challenge the College's
situation either way. Our
slogan Is apt: Universities
cannot run on money alone,
they need students too."
Imperial College Union
2 2nd May, 1 975 .
Dear Sirs,
We note the government's proposal for an increase of £70 in
tuition fees for a l l students and that the implementation is at
your discre tion.
We would like to point out some of the major effects of this
increase which will have an adverse effect on students. In the
lower sectors of the education system, namely primary and
secondary schools. This will be in the form of a reduction in
the amount of money available to the L E A ' s on top of the
recent cutbacks in education spending .
In particular the increase will cause a lot of hardship to
self supporting students and especially to those already paying
at the overseas rate. T h i s will deter many prospective students
who fall in the self supporting category (mainly postgraduates)
and have a detrimental effect on the research carried out in
this college .
We therefore strongly urge you to put the interests of the
students and the College first, by refusing to increase the fees.
Yours faithfully,
C . Kouroumotis,
Chairman
Overseas Students Committee
S . Mohindra
Chairman-elect
Overseas Students Committee
