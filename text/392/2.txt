I AM forced to question the quasi - martyrdom of the
IC Union President in not accepting a Union General
Award this year. Mr Phillips' case is that he does not
believe in such awards and besides it would be inappro-
priate he feels, to give himself an award.
On the first point, if he does not believe in UGA's
then he should have given none out. Indeed he has been
in the best position to campaign for their abolishment
but he has not done this.
On the second point, it is not up to Mr Phillips to
award himself a UGA: it is simply up to him either accept
or reject it and he has done the latter. And yet he has
accepted the award of social colours.
Ex-officio awards are those awards which have been
agreed upon by the Union and are automatically awarded
to certain people who are to be saved from the embarassing
paradox of having to present awards to themselves, i.e.
the awarder does not give himself an award; rather, the
award is given to him ex-officio on behalf of the Union.
Thus Mr Phillips is not refusing to give himself an
award; he is refusing to accept it. And considering that
he a c c e p t e d social colours, I find the s i t u a t i o n
approximately daft.
Why don't you just come out and say it, Trevor, that
you have an aversion of ties?
Last week saw the return to the practice of producing
just one issue of FELIX per week. The two issues per
week experimental pilot scheme was successful inasmuch
that it has now been proven that one person can produce
two four-pagers a week when the rest of the staff are
busy studying for their exams.
The scheme has had one drawback however: morale.
An eight or twelve page FELIX is a newspaper; a four-
pager is a just a newssheet. The feedback has been
either general sympathy (from those who recognise the
production difficulties) or open disappointment at the
size (from those who do not). The two-a-week idea still
has possibilities, but that will be up to future Editors.
Criticism of 'Parking Problem' Article
20'h May, 1975.
Dear S i r ,
R e : your artic fe dated 16th
May under the heading of
Parking Problems.
Parking has always been a
problem and always w i l l be,
at the feet of the P a r k i n g
Committee. U n l i k e P o l i c e
Traffic Wardens, John F u l l e r
and C o do not have the authority
to take matters into their own
hands and they have to use a
great deal of tact in performing
their d u t i e s . T h e majority of
students consider that John
does a great job w e l l .So I fail
to understand what was meant
by your a r t i c l e . C o u l d it be
that you have run out of material
or is Jacqui Gerrard jealous
because she has no car? P l e a s e
F E L I X , we do not attack
students, s o do not attack
members of staff who are only
doing their jobs.

(The whole lone of this
letter amazes me . In what was
a straight forward investigative
story, 1 simply reported the
statistics and both sides of
the argument. I was most
careful not to take sides on the
issue. Therefore your allegation
that I "attacked" (heaven
forbid!) John Fuller, the Parking
Warden, is totally unfounded.
1 suggest you re-read the
artic le ^-Ed .) .

T H E R U M O U R S surely can't be true - that we've upset a
number of you? C'mon lads, stop sulking and accept the apologies
of we humble IF g i r l s ! A c t u a l l y , I'm flattered that you read our
column avidly enough to make you s o touchy! (Did I s a y it right,
M i k e ? ) . Seriously though, folks, no offence whatsoever was meant
by last week's a r t i c l e , and we
truly felt that none would be
taken. S o can we forget it and
a l l be friends again? Good!
At the moment, the foremost
thing in most peoples' minds
are those nasty things that are
looming in the nerve-rackingly
close future - what a w a y to
spoil the summer! Mind you, I
think we have had the summer
(so short and sweet w a s it,
anyone had blinked, they would
have missed i t ! ) .
It was so determined, in fact,
to transform my lily-white skin
into a deep brown tan that I
even forewent my earlier
promises of studying last
Tuesday afternoon In favour of
a quiet afternoon blinking in
the sunshine and doing the
nearest to a decent strip that
I could (no, not to the chords
of a famous but rather hackneyed
t u n e ! ) .
The trouble about being
blonde (or is it "pale and
interesting"?) is those " l i g h t
brown spots on the s k i n "
(accord ing to the c o n c i s e Oxford
Dictionary), w h i c h do not mean
a sudden attack of acne, but an
attack of freckles!! A n c
mine are certainly not light
brown — more a delicate shade
of bright orange!
S t i l l , there's no danger of
that this weekend! Funny, isn't
it, but wherever I go, it always
seems to r a i n . I mean, last
weekend, I decided to stay In
London — and what happened?
It rained the whole time, didn't
it? Meanwhile, " b a c k home"
was in brilliant s u n s h i n e ! T h i s
weekend, I decided to go home
— so, what has it done s i n c e I
arrived? Y e s , you've guessed,
rain! So cursed am I, in fact, by
rain, that a friend sent me a
snoopy card telling me to "let
a smile be my umbrella". B u t ,
the way things are going, I ' l l
be walking around with a set
grin on my face for the rest of
my days!
Anyway, I hope I have
brought a little sunshine into
your lives and taken your minds
off exams, even if It was only
for a few minutes.
Good luck to one and a l l ,
keep s m i l i n g and have a sunny
summer!

24th May, 1975 .
Dear M i c h a e l , ,
I may be a feminist but did
you know that I a l s o have a
baby? It is i n fact the I F Only-
column. I brought i t into the
world and I watch i t s develop-
ment with nervous interest. My
eye twitched when L o r n a
Thomas announced l a s t week
that she was going to write
s ome th i n g " p leasa n t ly m unda ne "
but for Baby to become a
humble intruder i n the pages of
F E L I X ...that really is going
too far. One or two points
deserve attention:-
1. It is hardly consistent (to
say the least) that M i s s Thomas
should accuse others of
laurching into "indiscriminate
criticism" of I C and conclude
her article bu urging "budding
politicians at IC to step down
from their broing, extremist
platforms."
2. It is h y p o c r i t i c a l of her to
cry out against the apathy of
others with regard to R a g
c o l l e c t i n g , when her face h a s
certainly escaped mine on a l l
past Rag c o l l e c t i o n s .
3. It is unprofessional on her
part not to check her facts:
roughly half the girls at I F , not
two thirds, commute . ie., spend
more than a n hour getting to
c o l l e g e .
I am sure that it would be
for more to the point i f Lorna
outlined her plans for R a g next
year. Baby would be s o much
healthier too.

Sir,
It is some time since
anything angered me a s much
as last week's "IF Only". I
quote: "PS. Would all the
budding politicians at IC deign
to step down from their boring,
extremis platforms and DO
something constructive like
the rest of us peaceable
mortals, who realise we can't
change the world with our
radical ideas?"
It has been suggested that
M s . T h o m a s is referring to me .
Whether she i s or not, I c o n -
sider her comments s h a l l o w ,
self-righteous a n d offensive.
Some might a l s o s a y i l l -
mannered; I do not believe that
the fact that we make space
available to the Institut
F r a n c a i s i s a reason for them
to limit their c r i t i c i s m , but one

I presume that M s . Thomas,
