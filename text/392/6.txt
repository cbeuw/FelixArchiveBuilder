D U R I N G T H E public debate on continued membership of the
European Community much has been said about the bureaucratic
and undemocratic nature of its decision-making process. That the
present arrangement does not match up to the British concept of
democracy is undeniable, yet
played down by so many of
those who believe in a united
Europe. Indeed.it is ironic that
in the recent T V debate between
Michael FoStand Edward Heath
on s o v e r e i g n t y and the
Community, it was Mr Foot who
presented the more reasoned
and accurate a s s e s s m e n t .
There is no point In denying
that B r i t a i n , a s a p o l i t i c a l
unit, Is losing an amount of
self-government — that is the
e s s e n c e of a supranational
organisation such as the
European Community. What
gives cause for concern Is that
this " s o v e r e i g n t y " being
transferred from Westminster,
is going to the executive
Commission and C o u n c i l of
M i n i s t e r s . A l t h o u g h the
Ministers are responsible to
their national parliaments, this
can hardly be claimed to be a
satisfactory arrangement.
The European Parliament
has tended to be overlooked,
and even scorned. In the debate
over the past few months . Yet
here we have an embryonic
Community legislature of 198
M P ' s meeting once a month,
waiting for the day when it can
assume control over Community
affairs from the Commission
and C o u n c i l . A t the moment Its
powers are limited but r e a l . Not
only does It scrutinise proposed
legislation from B r u s s e l s , but
I t c a n d l s m i s s its ownexecutive,
the entire C o m m i s s i o n , on a
vote of no confidence — a
power denied to many national
so-called " p a r l i a m e n t s " . It
has curbed the C o m m i s s i o n ' s
one-time enthusiasm for
" h a r m o n i s i n g " everything In
sight (remember the infamous
" E u r o - b e e r " ? ) , and its control
over Community expenditure
has now been increased from
3% to about 20%. But perhaps
most important is its right to
challenge the executive, to
question, to c r i t i c i s e and to
speak out .The influx of B r i t i s h
Members has brought a wind of
change in this direction. With
the innovation of a Westminster-
style Question Time 1224
it is unfortunate that this point is
Questions were tabled in 1973
— our first year of membership
— and both written and oral
answers are supplied by the
C o u n c i l and the C o m m i s s i o n ,
both of whom are represented
in the H o u s e .
A t the present, Members are
nominated from national
parliaments, but the Treaty of
Rome p r o v i d e s for direct
elections to be held on a
Community-wide b a s i s . The
summit c o n f e r e n c e last
December c o n f i r m e d that
elections should be held a s
soon as practicable, and in
January Parliament approved a
Dutch s o c i a l i s t M P on the
procedure for such elections .
The " P a t i j n R e p o r t " , with
ammendments, c a l l s for the
Parliament to be enlarge from
198 to 355 seats, 67 of which
would be allocated to U K
Members, with elections taking
place on a target date of May
8th 1978, but not later than
May 1980.
It now remains for the
Patijn Report to be approved
by the Heads of Government,
but it is vitally important to
the future of the Community

Parliament the teeth it needs
to demand full control over
Community affairs. The House
of Commons has had to fight
for democratic control and the
European Parliament w i l l have

The European Community is
the nucleus around ' w h i c h a

F a r from being a s t a t i c , face-
less bureaucracy, It is in a
c o n t i n u a l p r o c e s s o f
development and evolution, and
we, the people of Europe, can
and must mould it to the shape
we want. It was Winston
C h u r c h i l l who said of European
unity — "We are not building a
machine: we are growing a
living plant".
"The European Community is the nucleus around which
a united Europe will be built."
