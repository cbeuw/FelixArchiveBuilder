Cities in Modern Britain
THIS B O O K is an introductory reader
in urban sociology which is a frame of
reference, an approach, w h i c h a l l o w s us
to make some sense of our s o c i e t y . It
c o l l e c t s s t a t i s t i c s about, for example,
the housing conditions of the various
c l a s s e s and racial groups in an urban
population, and provides a perspective in
w h i c h to view these s t a t i s t i c , a perspective
which plays a n important part in the
shaping of s o c i e t y . T o d i s m i s s sociology
as 'wooly' and imprecise is to deny the
value of town planning and s o c i a l a i d
programmes .
T o introduce a layman to ideas of
sociology is not easy, and c a n create
more confusion and misunderstanding than
already e x i s t s . T h i s book avoids present-
ing the esoteric r a m i f i c a t i o n s of
fashionable theories, or masses of
undiscernible s t a t i s t i c s . What it does is
a large number of h i g h l y readable extracts
from various papers a n d books on a
broad range of s u b j e c t s . The extracts are
in various s e c t i o n s , such as "Theories of
C i t i e s , " and " P e o p l e and P l a c e s " ,
each s e c t i o n containing an introduction
to set the passages in context, and an
appendix of books for those who w i s h to
study the subjects in d e p t h . T h i s book
does what it set out to do very w e l l , and
anyone writing an introductory book on
any subject would do w e l l to take note of
the techniques it u s e s .
Philip Webber
J . P . Donleavy: A Fairy Tale in New
York (Penguin).
S U D D E N L Y T H E usual has taken on a
q u a l i t y of humour after this book D o n l e a v y
manages to make you laugh at the genera I ly
unfunny and the positively macabre.
Our hero C o r n e l i u s C h r i s t i a n has
quite stunning talents for women, fighting
and just s u r v i v i n g to the next day by the
s k i n of h i s t e e t h . He charts a rather
curious course through New York, the c i t y
of h i s c h i l d h o o d . Occupations w h i c h
range from in a funeral parlour to an
advertising agency give some idea of his
d i v e r s i f i c a t i o n .
Donleavy is continually inventive and
h i l a r i o u s l y funny, you would recognize
C o r n e l i u s strutting down the street
towards you after reading this book .
James Wilkinson
Philip Warner: British Battlefields*
"The South" and "The North"(Fon-
tana).
T H E S E A R E the first two of four books
designed to form a handbook dealing with
the major battles fought on E n g l i s h and
Scottish s o i l , from Arthur's victory at
Mount Baden in A D 516 to the butchery
of Cumberland at C u l l o d e n in 1746. They
are both a remarkable exercise in histor-
ical reconstruction, containing not only
details of the battles themselves, but why
they were fought and what the results
were.
Most of the battles covered occured
during the Wars of the R o s e s . Treachery
abounds with nobles changing sides between,
battles. The culmination of a l l this being
Bosworth F i e l d (1485) at w h i c h half the
armies were never committed (their
commanders waited to see who was going
to win). Hence Richard H I : was left
stumbling around in a swamp crying ",A
horse! A horse! etc ..."
These very readable accounts are
written by P h i l i p Warner Senior-Lecturer
at Sandhurst. So a l l you followers of cut
and thrust, here's h i s t o r i c a l l y accurate
gore for you! P l u s details of how to getto
yer actual places where It a l l happened.
John Andrews
Stanislair Andreski: Social Sciences
as Sorcery (Penguin).
T H E P U R P O S E of this book Is to
explain to the reader that a considerable
percentage of what he reads in the s o c i a l
s c i e n c e vein Is quite p o s s i b l y unoriginal,
uninteresting and almost unreadable.This,
he s a y s , is because most people writing
In this subject tend to do so In a style
w h i c h has the effect of Impressing readers
not by what is being s a i d , but by the fact
that the c o n t i n u a l use of flve-6yllable
words, 'jargon* and b a s i c a l l y confusing
prose covers up the true meaning of what
is actually being s a i d . The only trouble
with the book is that he could have made
this point quite c o n c i s e l y in a chapter;
instead, he spends 250 pages on the same
topic, and quite frankly this gets rather
boring after a w h i l e . In the end he
becomes a v i c t i m of his own argument;
and he Is not averse to the odd indulgence
in unnecessarily over-long words himself
— one chapter Is entitled "Techno-
Totemism and Creeping Crypto-Totalitar-
ianism", w h i c h I think illustrates my
point. For bored s o c i o l o g i c a l freaks only.
Georges Simenon: The E ighth Simenon
Omnibus (Penguin).
T H E S I M E N O N Omnibus series
c o n s i s t s of c o l l e c t i o n s of, in general,
three short stories about the French
answer to Sherlock Holmes, the diffident
Inspector Maigret. I haven't read any of
the others but I should imagine this Is a
reasonably t y p i c a l example . A l l three are
set in P a r i s , and Simenon, althougha
B e l g i a n by birth, has an uncanny gift for
capturing the atmosphere of the city and
expressing it in a handful of sentences;
this knack gets him a gold star in my
estimation, as personally I find intermin-
able descriptive paragraphs tedious in the
extreme. The stories themselves are
pleasant enough; I'm afraid that that's
about It really, they're w e l l written and
reasonably interesting, but you won't
find much edge-of-the-seat stuff h e r e . If
your detective a b i l i t i e s are anything
above that of a baboon you shouldn't have
a great deal of trouble in figuring out who
the baddies are; rumour has It that they
a l l wear black berets anyway.
Desmond Young: Rommel (Fontana).
I H A V E always rated war books as
approximately equal to westerns in
interest level: both float around uncom-
fortably c l o s e to absolute zero. T h i s book
leaves them a l l way behind. Perhaps if
you were a historian you'd enjoy it; you
would a l s o be in a better position to
review It than me, a s you'd no doubt have
considerably more experience at digesting
books of this type . Biographies are odd
things to review; you can't describe the
plot, because there isn't one, and the
only opinion you c a n safely give is on
the character of the person d e s c r i b e d .
T h i s , in effect, Is like writing your own
extremely short biography . Anyway, here
goes. ( P a u s e ) . F i e l d — Marshall Rommel,
the 'Desert F o x ' , was a man whose s k i l l
as a military commander and t a c t i c i a n w a s
matched only by his huge narrow-mindedr
n e s s . Nothing interested him e x c p p t w a r
and the German A r m y . Nevertheless he
appears to have been somewhat more
intelligent and, perhaps, fairer than many
of his colleagues. He committed suicide
after being a c c u s e d of plotting to k i l l
H i t l e r .
Jimmy Osmond: Little Arrows
(MGM Records).
MY I N I T I A L reaction to this record
was that it was playing at 78rpm. I was
wrong, and having turned the treble down
I was able to receive this offering from
the remarkable Osmond camp w i t h the
minimum of pain. Intense concentration is
required to interpret the meaning and
purpose packed into every second of the
music but it soon becomes clear that this
is a contribution to contemporary minst-
relsy of prime importance.
The album takes the usual Osmond
viewpoint presenting a dogmatically
Marxian exposition of life in our c a p i t a l i s t
society, maintaining a s c i e n t i f i c rigour
throughout and encouraging revolution.
The m u s i c a l ' vehicle for Mr Osmond's
message is the c a l l - c o n t r a d i c t i o n -
response, a d i a l e c t i c a l method now
common on the pop s c e n e .
"Little arrows", the L e a p y Lee hit,
is the opening track. But this version is
a remarkable reinterpretation substituting
"Little Ear 'oles" for "Little Arrows"
presumably to indicate the omnipresence
of CIA d e v i c e s , although I get the feeling
that it might be due to an unfortunate
speech impediment. "Day O" describes
the experiences of a worker in a banana
factory and u t i l i s e s a reggae rythm to
suggest repetition.
T a k i n g a firm grip on his concepts
Mr Osmond staggers forward to excrete
his accumulated philosophy into the
receptacle of his audience and deftly
flushes away false consciousness with
"Purple People Eater". T h e monster in
question is plainly the corrupt imperialist
American system. T h i s is followed by
"Don't You Remember" in w h i c h the
opposing rhythms of percussion and
strings synthesise an explosion of aural,
stimulation w h i c h is designed to i n s t i l
solidarity into the pop fans of the/ world
and encourage rejection of the treacherous
fan c l u b leadership who have become
ideologically separated from their rank
and file members.
The record should work wonders for
The Osmonds' economic infrastructure but
luckily their in a c l a s s by t h e m s e l v e s .
If a s k e d for a neutral assessment I
would say that the album is rather like a
diet of enchiladas and green c h i l e s a n d -
wiches — acceptable if ones palate is
attuned to the treatment but after a w h i l e
its surely enough to make the strongest
man reach for the paracetamal.
