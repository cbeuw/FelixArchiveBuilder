as I F R a g rep, would like me
to p l a y a n active part in
C a r n i v a l ' s a c t i v i t i e s . The
members of my U n i o n may have
different ideas as to what they
elected me and pay me to be
doing. I would like to think that
I am doing a constructive job
for them. Notwithstanding this,
it might interest M s . Thomas
to know that the first position
I held in this U n i o n was as an
R C S U S o c i a l R e p . She w i l l
know that s o c i a l reps are
responsible f o r C a r n i v a l
a c t i v i t i e s , and indeed, I spent
much time on U S K R a g , as it
then w a s . It might a l s o interest
her that, outside C o l l e g e , my
Methodist background intro-
duced me to charitable a c t i v i t y
at an early a g e . I have been a
member of IC Community
A c t i o n Group (though not
active recently for four years.
I spent much of my final year
teaching 17 and 18-year olds
to read and write in Notting
H i l l Gate.
However, I have a l s o seen
and lived with real poverty and
suffering in L a t i n A m e r i c a and
the West Indies on a scale not
seen i n B r i t a i n . It is that kind
of experience coupled with my
other a c t i v i t i e s that has
convinced me that the only
real remedy for that suffering is
effective p o l i t i c a l a c t i o n . I
should point out that Mahatma
Ghandi and J a c k A s h l e y , M P
(Britain's leading campaigner
for the d i s a b l e d and handi-
capped, as w e l l a s thalidomide
children found this out before I
d i d .
I do not underestimate the
need for charitable a c t i v i t y ,
but it is not enough. T h o s e ,
like L o r n a Thomas, who believe
that no change is possible in
our world, condemn m i l l i o n s to
continued suffering by their
refusal to face the fundamental
problems of our s o c i e t y .
