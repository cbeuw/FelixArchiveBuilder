THIS Y E A R was the second i n the life of the U L U L a d i e s '
Hockey L e a g u e . T h e major teething troubles had been sorted out
last year and i n October we eagerly anticipated a n eventful and
s u c c e s s f u l s e a s o n . Our hopes were boosted when about eight
Freshers joined u s . Our first sortie was to the annual U L U seven-
a-side tournament at Motspur
P a r k , where we fielded eight
people, taking turns to s i t out.
I d o not remember the score,
but I greaned inwardly when
about five of our players were
a s k e d to attend the U L U t r i a l s
the following weekend. T h e
seven-a-side tournament i s a
pre-selection for the University
team t r i a l s , and those selected
to play for U L U generally
disappear down to Malet Street,
never to be seen again b y
lesser mortals! However, o n
realising this, our patriotic I C
L a d i e s excused themselves
from the trials for various
reasons, that i s , a l l except V i v
Hughes, who became the U L U
team Treasurer a n d i s next
year's C a p t a i n . Congratulations
V i v ! — but we do miss y o u .
Our first match was versus
K i n g ' s C o l l e g e . F o r some
reason, K i n g ' s h a d a bomb
scare that morning, s o at around
12.30 pm I w a s informed that
they had a l l been evacuated
from the building (with their k i t
inside), no-one knew whether
they had got a team and would
we detain one of our coaches
until they arrived at I C ? O f
course, the coach driver would
not wait, a n d I was left to wait
for K i n g ' s . I think three girls
turned u p , who thought that the
rest had gone straight to
Harlington i n a c a r . S o I took
these out by Greenline bus and
walked up to the ground (—no
mean treat when you are unfit!—)
to be greeted by the rest of
K i n g ' s a n d of course I C .
D i s a p p o i n t i n g l y , they beat us
4—3 (only because we didn't
have a g o a l i e ) . T h e weather
was not on our side after that
and many matches were rained
off.
The next memorable o c c a s i o n
was at R o y a l H o l l o w a y . Our
eight v s their eleven w a s a
positively unfair to s l i c e
D i a n a ' s ear off with a high b a l l
(well, a l m o s t ! ) . I think we
should be proud of that score:
13—1 to R . H . It w a s shear
genius to get that goal of ours.
A g a i n , yours truly was " kicking
back" i n the absence of a
g o a l i e . M y motto — when i n
goal, d u c k !
We played a few other
matches, but during the first
term most were rained off, and
so enthusiasium disappeared
both a t I C a n d other c o l l e g e s ,
and many of the remaining
matches were c a l l e d off because
of the lack of players. We came
about half-way up the final
league table, which was a
good r e s u l t . I hope that I C
L a d i e s do much better next
year, under D i a n a Mounsey
(Captain) a n d Sarah Horn
(Secretary).
would like to wish
all its readers
THE BEST OF LUCK
WITH THEIR EGZA MS!
