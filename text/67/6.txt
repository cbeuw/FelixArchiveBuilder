ROWING
The Morphy and Lowry crews have now a e t t l e d
down to a f u l l t r a i n i n g programme,and tha muscle
weary oarsmen trooping down E x h i b i t i o n Road i n
tha celd grey light of a South Kensington dawn*
are not to be confused with other personalties
returning from a l l night drunken orgies.
The R.S.M.Morphy orew captained by Rabin
Appleby,qontain three ex-Ist VIII members,one 2nd
v i l l member,and one of l a s t year's flying fresher
grew,the rest of the crew being made up of freshers
a l l with previous experience.
The Mines Lowry crew i s a heavy one,and i f the
conditions are d i f f i c u l t the Guilds and R.C.S. w i l l
have a hard raoe t o beat them.
The R.0,8. captained by Ted Guthrie have not
been quite so fortunate,and have had t o dragoon
several freahera lnte the d e l i g h t s of e a r l y morning
outings.In addition to the lack of oarsman,the craws
suffered at f i r s t from a l a c k of coaches.These
teething troubles have now been remedied and the
Morphy orew w i l l provide the o p p o s i t i o n with a geed
raee.
The Guilds boat olub undarthe c a r e f u l ocach-
ing ef Mr.Stuart Peerless have had early morning
outings regularly threetiaea a weak,and although i t
seemed at f i r s t that tha Guilds would not have any
outstanding crews,this opinion has new altered and
both the crews stand a goed chance of winning.
Whatever the outooae Morphy day l a a great
attraction,and we wish a l l crews good r a c i n g .
The Rueb.v Club o n e n e d i t s season w i t h what
la prooably i t s strongest f i x t u r e — against
Wasps Vandals. By l o s i n g 9 p o i n t s t o 0» tin*
1,0, team i n no way disgraced i t s e l f , s i x of the
points coming from p e n a l t y goals. The game was
particularly hard fought among the forwards, Wasps!
having the edge of a c l o s e contest. On neither
side did the backs show any great form, which was
due to marking always keen , i f a t times a l i t t l e
unscientific.
On Wednesday we r e o e i v e d Wye c o l l a g e b e a t i n g

by the fact that only 50 minutes were p l a y e d .
