LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
The Editor,
HELIX.
S i r ,
There have been three bonfire hope at
Harlington, and each has been marred by injury and
damage caused by fireworks thrown on to the dance
floor. Apart from direct damage by burning,
people have been caused to s p i l l coffee and other
drinks over their olothee: many w i l l remember the
damage cauaed to expensive evening wear on Corona-,
tion night when a firework was l e t o f f during the
toasts.
Each year, loudspeaker appeals prove i n -
effectual; and i n any case they are seldom given
u n t i l damage has occurred. May I suggest, s i r ,
that you use your greet power of publicity to a
good cause by undertaking to publish the names of
people g u i l t y of the irresponsible antisocial
behaviour which we have come to expect at our Bon-
f i r e Might Dances.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
A.R. Bray
Dear S i r ,
In answer to your a r t i c l e entitled
Hopes and Hops' I should say i t i s a very f a i r
c r i t i c i s m of the situation. For tomorrow's dance
we have 400 tickets and shall do our best to im-
prove the acoustics and the ventilation - as for
the queue, gentlemen, you have only yourselves
to blame1
We aim to replaoe most of the records
In case 'A' by Easter and would welcome any t i t l e
your'readers deem suitable for dancing.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
David R. Hattersley.
We have had man/ l e t t e r s about the two
contributions from Cassandra. Ifeere i s only
apaoe to reproduce two of these; of the others
one was a rebuke from a young lady, not a mem-
ber of ICWA, who claim's to hare close oontaot
with many of our male members. I f this flood
of correspondence continues we s h a l l nave to
•
, give Cassandra her own newspaper.
The E d i t o r , -
Dear S i r , t
on behalf of my many colleagues i n F i z z
one, may I say to "miss" Cassandra that she i s
very misled (possibly because she has not beent)
in her ideas about the men of the great and noble
R.C.S. / i
Adjusting the c u f f s of my nylon s h i r t and
p u l l i n g up my terylene socks I have taken up my
typewriter to do b a t t l e with t h i s "she".
In the R.C.S. there are 72 young men, every-
one of them handsome, charming, i n t e l l i g e n t and
very e l i g i b l e . These gentlemen are a l l i n F i z z
one, very happy and f a i r l y cbntented when along
comes t h i s "she". These gentlemen, knowing only
the three very charming young l a d l e s i n t h e i r midst
. w i l l now think that they are exceptional, and that
a l l the other women are t e r r i b l e harridans.
Gentlement Let us up and away from these
women.
Let us don our Teddy Boy s u i t s and s a l l y f o r t h
to our l o c a l " P a l a i s de Dense" to d i s p l a y the fancy
waistcoats that ICWA does not appreciate, and where
we can find n i c e g i r l s .
Let us go to the other c o l l e g e s i n search of
women, l e t us go anywhere Gentlemen, whatever our
department, but l e t us leave these women to wallow
'.'in t h e i r l o n e l y penance u n t i l t h e i r spokeswoman i s
forever s i l e n c e d ,
ties, 'ij:,'."..'Let usv seek her out and place her In Mr,
Neale'a balloon and shoot her down on Nov. Sth.

Comment on 'Cassandra'
With regard t o 'Cassandra',
- I've ho wish t o slondra -
She appears i n a r u t :
Nothing b u t
A f r u s t r a t e d philandra.
A lass i n her shoes
Shouldn't stoop to abuse.
S h e ' l l f i n d , with remorse,
Of course,
I t ' s the males who choose.

Dear S i r ,
R e c e n t l y we attended the R.S.M. F r e s h - /
e r a ' Dinner as guests. L a t e r , as a f t e r a l l
good d i n n e r s , we r e t i r e d t o the bar i n t e n d i n g
to show these poor "minors" how t o d r i n k t h e i r '
yard i n beer. U n f o r t u n a t e l y t h e i r funds ran
low very e a r l y on and they c o u l d r a i s e n o t h i n g
b e t t e r than 1&- p i n t s of d i l u t e orange squash
and 1 g i n ( c o n t r i b u t e d by one of the members).
As a consequence of t h i s we would suggest
t h a t the R.S.M. grant f o r the s e s s i o n 1955-.56
be Increased by 9d., t h i s e x t r a money r e p r e ^
s e n t i n g the i n c r e a s e i n cost of beer over- o r -
ange squash. I f they cannot persuade the t.C.

est t h a t they use the 6 inch "yard" blown with
the f a i r wind of the P r e s i d e n t of the R.C.S.

WATT A. WORDSWORTH'S
NIGHTMARE
Jr
(A Nightmare i n Three Visitations)
PROLOGUE
The other n i g h t our Poet, racked with care
Disposed of more than half a Camembert,
And, thus equipped, sank deep i n stony sleep .
Through which hobgoblins, gnomes and things that
ereep
Disported round his overheated brain
And showed him sights he ne'er would see again.
But, waking as the rosy day was dawning,
He wrote for us this grim prophetic warning.
VISITATION THE FIB8T
"An I.C. student shrinking i n the dock.
November sixth, at Bow Street, ten o'clock.
His crime? As v i l e as any crime can be! •
He celebrated thwarted Anarchy.
(Three hundred years t h i s custom f l o u r i s h e d , then
**
Was h a p p i l y abolished by the Senate.)
This stupid student f a i l e d t o understand
The underlying t r u t h s which r u l e our land,
Of which the foremost, student, i s that you
Must never a l i e n a t e the Men i n Blue
(Who through your s e l f i s h n e s s are c a l l e d In
batches
From guarding f o r e i g n kings and f o o t b a l l matches)
VISITATION THE SECOND
The Premier stands; the House i s s t i l l ;
Nor mouse nor clock subverts h i s w i l l .
In t r a g i c tone; with glowing eye
He wields h i s massive oratory.
"In view of I.C.'s recent f o l l y
We cannot give them any l o l l y :
The cheque must go to Chelsea Poly."
VISITATION THE THIRD
A S p i r i t waves me on
To darkest Kensington
Where, deep i n dank and stagnant fen
I f a l l upon a haunt of men.
In mould'ring heaps l i e r u i n s grim
(Though a l l have r o o f s except the gymi)
And everywhere the' eye can see
S i t s d e s o l a t i o n nakedly. fe
Hunched upon a r o c k , a sad
Inexpressibly o l d Post Grad
B r a y s i n accents black w i t h woe
"I t o l d you so; I t o l d y o u so."
EPILOGUE (Spoken by a d u p l i c a t i n g machine)
The eyes o f t h e N a t i o n a r e on us, chaps,.
The ears o f the world are i n tune,
ojet no one be s t a i n e d by the s l i g h t e s t lapse;
Let none d a r e to s u l l y the name wmch perhaps
W i l l rocket i n Science's uneharted maps
And shine on t h e heights o f the moon.'
Our duty i s c l e a r : we must p l a y the game
And r i s e above c h i l d i B h things.
Now staunchly, devotedly, heart a l l aflame
Let every Jack man of UB loudly proclaim
From t r o p i c to pole our I l l u s t r i o u s Name
And t h e p r o m i s e o u r F u t u r e brings.'
