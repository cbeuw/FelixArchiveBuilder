GUILDS
On the evening of Friday, October 15th, the
Guilds Freshers assembled i n the Upper Dining Hall
for their annual buffeting and welcome from the
Guilds Union.
Your correspondent who, since his ticket said
"7.00 for 7.30", thought he would arrive at 7.30,
missed the l i t t l e party where the principal
speakers were strengthening themselves with sherry
and port. Instead, he arrived at 7.36 and found
that the Freshers were up to standard since most
of the food and free beer had already vanished.
Several well-known second and even third year
'freshers' were also there. These gentlemen did
not seem to be so interested i n the food as the
genuine freshers; rather they showed their ex-
perience by strategic grouping around the barrels.
The President, Andy Levins, clad i n his robes
of offloe, Introduced himself- and the Guilds
Spanner (whioh i s not tho original totem pole) to
the assembly. Professor Hewitt proposed the
health of the Dean, Professor Pippard. Both,
rather naturally, reminded the Fresher3 that they
shoujd mix i n a l i t t l e work with their Union a c t i -
v i t i e s . Professor Pippard said that for the f i r s t
time Guilds register had topped the 1000 mark and
he wanted to see 1000 on the f i n a l pass l i s t . Kim
Ash proposed the toast of the-guests, to which Dr.
Sparkes replied. He dealt at some length with
the proposed College extensions, and made a big
hit when he said that not only the students were
aware of the shortage of women undergraduates at
Guilds. I f anybody could find some suitable can-
didates, several members of the staff, including
Dr. Sparkes, would be pleased to give them encou-
raging interviews.
Alec Praser proposed the toast to the
Freshers and told them that they should mix i n
some Union activities with their work. He remin-
ded the Dean that people do not only sometimes
f a i l their l a t . Year exams, for example, he
himself was trying his Part I I again!
The old hands initiated the Freshers into tne
meaning of 'a Boomalaka•, and then those who were
s t i l l thirsty removed downstairs to begin the real
business of the evening. In no time at a l l the
Bar was quickly f i l l e d with the sounds of singing.
As time went on, your correspondent remembers less
and less - perhaps thankfully. Although the
originality and wide general knowledge of one of
the Freshers from Manchester should be valuable to
Guilds, he seemed to know at leas* one new verse
to a l l the songs. At 11.00 the b a r shut to make
I t s e l f presentable for the morrow, and the party
removed i t s e l f for another Boomalaka on the Tennis
Courts, and then on to the Royal College of Art
Hop i n Cromwell Road. But that i s another
story
