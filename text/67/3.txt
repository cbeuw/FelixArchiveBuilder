THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE
Editor t J.S. S3ELBY Ciroulation * 1200
A theme for an Editorial this week would
seem to be — 'back to normal'. Union a c t i v i t i e s
are being well supported, the oonatituent Unions
are making their preparations f o r the events of the
term, tickets are sold out f o r Hops, and we have
Nov. 5th. and Morphy Day to oome very soon, do not
forget to j o i n i n on those days.
FELIX i s so f u l l of news that we have hardly
any i l l u s t r a t i o n s t h i s time, and there i s only this
l i t t l e space for the Editor to raok his brains over.
We appologise to our contributors whose writings
have been l e f t for another time, keep on writing.
FELIX No. 68 w i l l be out on Nov 12th.,
contributions should be i n by Nov. 5th.
FELIX i s pleased to oongratulate Mike
Hiokard (H.C.S.), on h i s engagement to Janet
Barber (late of Avery H i l l ) .
HOW DO YOU EAT?
The Refectory Committee held a Meeting on
Monday Oot. 25th., whioh w i l l be reported i n our
next issue. I t was expeoted that the overcrowd-
ing i n the Refeotory, i n the Snack Bar, and i n
Queenie's, at lunch times, would be discussed i n
f u l l . The FELIX survey on the situation has
not been rigorous enough to publish figures as
yet, but we hope to have more news next time.
GUILDS UNION.
The f i r s t Guilds Union meeting of the session
was held i n Room 17 last Thursday.
On the agenda was the election of an I.C.
Council Rep. and a F i r s t Year Rep. these positions
being f i l l e d by Ralph Robins and T.S. Lewis re-
spectively.
The President informed the gathered multitude
tnat Morphy Bay i s to be held on Nov. 10th. He had
bean to see the Dean regarding any j o l l i f i c a t i o n s
whioh might take plaoe and was Informed that pro-
vided no damage to persons or property was incurred
he had no objection to a b i t o f fun. Mr. Tony Holt
said that "Bo" would most probably be baok from
Armstrong- Whitworths for that date.
As regards the Lord Mayor's Show, Guilds wou-
ld not be represented this year but would take part
in next sears procession. The President asked for
suggestions f o r tne theme of next year's Show.
I..en followed a long disoussion on the wearing
of gowns i n College. The feeling of the meeting was
that a student may wear a gown i f he so desired and
the President promised to bring the matter up at the
next I.C. Council Meeting.
Tne proceedings finished off with a "by
request" Boomlaka" and the throng dispersed at 2.14
President's time!
The R.C.S. and Mines Unlbn Meetings w i l l have
been held too late for us to . sport on them, they
will have to be held over for next time. *

MOTOR CLUB RALLY
Last Sunday the Freshers' Rally was held i n the
rustic atmosphere of Matching i n i&sex.
On arrival at the aerodrome which was to be
used as a testing ground, the captain of the club
met a farmer in possession who clained the vest
a i r f i e l d , and denied the club the use of i t . Shortly
afterwards, the representatives of the Ferd Motor
Company Joined Tony Holt and the farmer, intent an
high speed t r i a l s . As i f that was not enough, the
Navy and former number two came upon the scene}
the former used the place for storing oak for HMS
"Victory", whilst the latter wanted to grace his
Sheep on the runways.
In a state of despair, the club officers celled
on the local constabulary, and found to their
r e l i e f that the Club HAD the air Ministry consent
to use the f i e l d .
Share was an excellent entry, ranging from a
competitor In his father's Riley to a Bentam which
was given a hasty de-coke at lunch-time, and, as
the last bolt was tightened the parched driver sew
the "White Hart" close on the ssroke of two.
She f i e l d was divided into two, one half "taking
the driving tests i n the morning and motoring
round the thirty five point-to-point i n the after-
noon, whilst the other half reversed tfeis procced-
ure.
There were seven tests, of which five had to ue "
•
completed; these included "Cold" start, regularity
wheel changing, slow riding, blindfold driving,
parking, acceleration and braking, and garaging
tests.
Due to the kind offer of the owner, our reporter
traversed the point-to-point on the p i l l i o n of »
Sunbeam, and i n his endeavour to show how well he
could map reed, he navigated the vehicle down a
mud track, over a tiny foot-bridge and across* a
fallow f i e l d onto a road which shouldn't have been
there.
Many people stayed after tea to take part in the
unig.ua combination of an egg-end-spoon race with
the Grand Prix with Hunt-the-Thimble, the thimble
being a Marshal i n a tree or a ditch or *>von the
pub. At seven o'clock the day ended, and a l l adjou
-rhed to discuss the mere intimate details of the
most successful Rally for some time.

vastly amused by last week s correspondent who

a notable miner who has recently acquired the

But enough of this. The second half of her
