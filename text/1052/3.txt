Bicycle Thefts Cause Alarm
BY DIPAK GHOSH
A spate of bicycle thefts around
College has triggered the installa-
tion of closed circuit television
cameras to counter the growing
menace posed by criminals.
The easily accessible sheds
beside RCS I have been the most
regularly hit, but the Southside,
Mechanical Engineering and
Main Library sites have not
escaped. One thief was caught
last week in the act of stealing a
bike, by an Imperial College
Security guard, and was subse-
quently handed over to the
police. Despite the large number
of incidents, this was only the
second time since October that a
thief has been caught stealing
bicycles.
The recent surge in bike
thefts has meant that the need
for routine patrols of bike sheds
has become a priority. Plain
clothes police and IC security
staff routinely patrol the bike
sheds to deter potential culprits.
This clearly has had limited suc-
cess so far, suggesting that the
thefts have been due to a well
organised'group.
Closed Circuit T V (CCTV)
cameras have been purchased by
College to cover the walkway
area in between the Mechanical
Engineering, Electrical Engin-
eering and the RSM. There are
also plans to introduce similar
cameras around the main library,
one of the largest bicycle storing
areas, though this is subject to
the availability of funds.
Keith Reynolds, College's
Head of Security, emphasised
that the main problem in procur-
ing more cameras is their cost.
"Last year we concentrated on
computer security - upgrade of
bike security is dependent on the
budget," M r Reynolds insisted.
He defended Security's current
performance saying, "It would be
ideal if there was one central site
for parking bikes, but at the
moment there are all scattered
about thus making it difficult to
monitor."
Mr Reynolds also said that
the bike shed for the new
Biomedical Sciences has not been
fully integrated into the plans.
â€¢ The current provisional proposal
is to locate it in the walkway,
though this will not be enough to
accommodate all the bicycles
that will be coming along with
the medical students.
With C C T V s likely to be
installed in the walkway area
during the next three or four
weeks, M r Reynolds advises stu-
dents worried about security to
park their bikes there.

On Tuesday Imperial College security apprehended a thief stealing
a bicycle, but as the owner has yet to come forward, the police have
been unable to press charges. Anyone who lost a bike at the begin-
ning of the week should contact Sherfield security (extension
58900.)
English Heritage to decide on BMS plans today
BY TIM ST CLAIR
English Heritage (EH) will meet
today to decide whether to give
their support to the plans for the
new Biomedical Science (BMS)
complex. They will make a rec-
ommendation to Kensington and
Chelsea Borough Council
(K&CBC) in time for the next
planning meeting, scheduled for
Wednesday of next week.
Representatives from English
Heritage came to Imperial
College on Tuesday to examine'
the proposed construction site.
This inspection was followed by a
meeting with architects from Sir
Norman Foster and Partners
where the plans for the B M S
building were examined to assess
their compatibility with the pre-
sent architecture. It has emerged
that English Heritage's interest in
the much delayed demolition of
RCS II building centres not on
the old building's preservation,
but on the suitability of the pro-
posed B M S building for it's
planned location adjacent to the
Queen's Lawn.
The emphasis is on the long
established designation of the
Science Museum / RCS I area as
a conservation zone, and the fact
that the Queen's Tower is a list-
ed building. This enforced
preservation means that any
major new construction work
around the Queen's Lawn area
must fit in with the current envi-
ronment.
Ian Caldwell, Imperial
College's Director of Estates,
said that he didn't anticipate any
major problems, though he
admitted that they may have to
'tweak the plans a little.' He
explained that the building's 'off-
shoots' would actually be 'archi-
tecturally joined up' to the RCS I
building. It is possible that E H
will give their consent to the
BMS proposal with the proviso
that adjustments are made to the
area where the buildings meet.
The RCS II building should
have been demolished by the
middle of February but College
planners still insist that this time
can be made up. If E H give the
go-ahead as expected, demolition
is set to 'go ahead almost instan-
taneously'. M r Caldwell predict-
ed that they would only end up
being three weeks behind sched-
ule, an amount he felt could be
easily absorbed. "We never
expected that getting planning
would be easy," he said.
Mr Caldwell does admit that
E H should have been involved in
the planning process at a much
earlier stage. H e says that this
delay is due to 'a breakdown in
communication'. Apparently this
occurred when documents
mailed in October by K & C B C
were not received by E H , but he
generously commented that they
were now being 'very helpful'.
