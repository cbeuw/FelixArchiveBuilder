founder member of women's

for the promotion of the arts and
the importance of health & safe-
ty while James Handley, former
IC radio station manager, empha-
sised on his belief that approach-
ability is one of the more impor-
tant aspects of being a deputy
president. Neil O'Shaughnessy,
Senior Union Steward, cited his
plans to better publicise Clubs &
Societies using the five major stu-
dent publications. The candi-
dates were also asked whether
their past associations with spe-
cific clubs might impinge on their
impartiality, if elected.
Piers Williams, Pub Board
Chair and the only candidate for
Deputy President (Finance &
Services), was described by his
proposer as "level headed and
clued-up", and managed to bring
some levity to the evening. He
was questioned at length regard-
ing his hair-dying habits, denying
rumours that this had ceased in a
search for credibility. Piers did
face some serious questions,
promising to steer I C U through
its 'financial turning point' given
the recent cuts.

Sticky: The candidate for Felix editor and Print Unit manager, Alex
Feakes, and his proposer Mark Baker were particularly well-flanned
to appease the wrath of St Mary's at the hustings on Wednesday.
(Current I C U council chair and
MechEng P G ) , Mark Bridge
(Felix news-writer and chemistry
U G ) and Luke Morales (Ents DJ
and Biology PG) were grilled
extensively on numerous topics.
Luke and Eric advocated staying
out of the N U S whereas Mark
appeared to support affiliation.
Their political views were also
scrutinised though they all
appeared to back 'New
Solutions', a non-NUS affiliated
pressure group proposing alterna-
tives to student funding.
The candidates all seemed to
be keeping their spirits up after
rigorous treatment at the hands
of St Mary's on Wednesday. "I've
drunk piss before and I'm sure
I'll drink it again in the future,"
commented Eric Allsop.
New Election is also standing
for all posts, if another poll next
term is a better option than any
of the candidates. Voting will
take place in departments around
South Kensington, Paddington
and Silwood Park sites next
Monday and Tuesday.
Sir Ron to
Investigate
BY DIPAK GHOSH
The Government's favourite
education trouble-shooter, Sir
Ron Dearing, is to carry out a
thorough review of the Higher
Education sector. According to a
recent ministerial announce-
ment, Sir Ron's enquiry will take
about 12 months, with the final
report widely predicted to criti-
cise provisions in the Bill, and
recommend yet another student
funding mechanism.
This has triggered some of
the members of the House of
Lords to describe the Student
Loans. Bill as a 'dead duck'.
During the debate which pre-
ceded its second reading in the
Upper Chamber on Monday, a
large number of peers called for
Gillian Shepherd, Education and
Employment Minister, to scrap
the Student Loans Bill altogeth-
er.
One detractor was Lord
Morris of Castle Morris who
cautioned the Government
against imposing the Bill. "Even
at this late stage, withdraw it.
Scrap it. Take the advice of the
good old English proverb: if at
first you don't succeed - give
up'.", he pleaded.
New medical syllabus leaves students in the dark
BY ALEX FEAKES
Imperial College authorities
acknowledged last week that the
syllabus for the Imperial College
School of Medicine's (ICSM)
degree is not ready, leaving cur-
rent students ignorant of the con-
tent of the later years of their
course. The course is being over-
hauled in preparation for the
merger of Charing Cross and
Westminster and St Mary's med-
ical schools in 1998, and changes
in it could mean less choice for
the students.
The content of the new
degree's curriculum has been
thrashed out at numerous work-
ing parties and discussion groups,
yet important elements of the
course's structure remain unre-
solved, particularly the new clini-
cal aspects. Professor Edwards,
Principal of the ICSM, explained
that the review of the degree was
implemented because of a deci-
sion by the General Medical
Council's education committee
to alter how doctors are trained.
He stressed that "we can't resist
this change," and that it was
important that students would
not be disadvantaged by the
change.
Louise Moran, Education
Representative of St Mary's
Union, told Felix that medical
students are pleased with the
content of the new degree,
describing it as 'good, but tough'
but she pointed out that the plans
were not finalised. This raised
concerns that the October 1998
intake of students would be used
as "guinea pigs" for the course
without any compensating reduc-
tion in workload for the extra
clinical work in the new degree's
first year. She said they had been
told that the relocation of the
school to the South Kensington
site would mean that there would
be "not as much choice, and a
more difficult course."
In answer to this, Professor
Edwards said that the switch over
to the new course in 1998 would
happen for all the years, and that
there had been a "decrease in fac-
tual content" and an "increase in
self learning" (around a core cur-
riculum that all students would
be taught.
The prospectus for the
course is currently being pre-
pared,, and Professor Edwards
expressed the opinion that the
changes for the course should be
finalised "as quickly as possible, if
not this year" in order for them
to be publicised. However, he
admitted that some very basic
things, such as the convergence
of the entry criteria for Charing
Cross and St Mary's, have not
been fully cleared up, though
funding for the extra year which
the new degree entails has been
secured.
Louise agreed that the fund-
ing issue had been worked out to
everyone's satisfaction, but
repeated that students are
unhappy with the timetable for
the implementation of the new
syllabus. She hoped that they
"would sort it out before the
course starts."
