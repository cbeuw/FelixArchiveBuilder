d e m o c r a c y ?
I have lived perfectly happily in
Northern Ireland most of my life
and never before had the experi-
ence I have now of finding
myself caught behind a police
line. There's a suspect package in
the Albert Hall and the police
have cordened off the area -
we've been told to keep away
from the windows. Doubtless
it's only some little old lady's
knitting, but on the other hand...
I went into some preten-
tious what-kind-of-democracy-
do-we-live-in? tirade after the
spectacle of this week's sabbati-
cal hustings. But now I've been
reminded that Monday's vote on
the integrity of our government
after the Scott report was deter-
mined by the utterly unrelated
issue of the format of elections in
Northern Ireland. I guess it
seems a little ironic to complain
about the lack of discussion of
issues in hustings on student
union politics.
m a n y e r r a t a
I think it's time to apologise
heartily to those hockey and
football people attempting to
raise funds for their trip to
Barbados. Yes, it's true. I really
am totally inept. They weren't
very happy when a perfectly gen-
uine article a telling us about
their plans for this summer's
tour went in under a fairly sar-
castic headline.
So when I read my sports
editor's offering for the back
page just before I sent it to press
last week, the heading "Are you a
hustler?" seemed far too flippant
for the serious business of raising
money for a hockey tour. (It
turns out that was the one the
teams provided themselves.
Clearly my idea of a silly head-
line differs from theirs). So I
changed it. Or attempted to, at
any rate.
The simple, direct message
of "Barbados fundraising"
seemed appropriate, but sadly
after one too many late nights I
was completely unable to type,
and replaced a 'b' for an 'n'. O f
course, when I gave the page to
someone for proofing they
assumed the sports teams were
raising funds for that highly
respected children's charity, Dr
Barnados.
Oops. I really am very sorry
indeed.
p o l i c e
Apparently they've all packed up
and gone home now. It was only
a false alarm.
