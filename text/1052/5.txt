The rumours are without ioundation.
Sarah White does think; not in the way an
incisive and seasoned politician thinks, but
then that is part of the problem of being a
sabbatical, as she explains:
i
ian, rightly or w . • . here's a
i then either it's • lank,
or if not then the Preside, t be
able to solve it."
She makes no attempt to hide the ip&t,
tration in her voice -'despite the H

"I don't mind doing reception when I
have to 'cause the girls at the front do a lot
for us... I enjoy working the bar and even hav-
ing to find lightbulbs for the DJ's light, it
sounds stupid but you feel more valuable j
then than at any other time".
She sounds almost disappointed with the
lack of headline making opportunities - most
sabbaticals harbour some megalomaniac
ambitions, at least initially.
"My idea of the job has changed and
changes everyday. The role of President is
loosely defined as it is, so you have to expect
big differences from year to year in wj
have to do... but in a more general sense, this
term I've come to terms with what I can and
can't do which is important... You grow and
learn so quickly it's unbelievable".
Some might say that she hasn't learnt
nun h at all so far.
' You can't do everything right. When I
started I didn't know what I could and could-
n't do, and you fool yourself into believing
youi manifesto claims, which are complete
bullshit anyway. Once you start you quu kh
realise that College aren't just going to give
:
you £20m for new facilities, or be fooled by
innocent emotional arguments about student
hardship that they hear every year... you have
to make a lot up as you go along and play the
game."
The 'game' is the perpetual tussle that is
the fabric of the Union-College relationship.
Its ethereal, political nature, involving subjec-
tive interpretation of events and ambiguous
minutes, is a large part o i why she is misun-
derstood, or so she claims.
This isn't an excuse for apathy on her
: part, she adds, rather it underlines how sab-
batic als ever year are ill-equipped for the first
i ouple oi months to deal with some of the
situations they tind themselves in.
When enlightenment does come, it's
oftenYdunng the last six months of the |ob
which offer alcimpletely different perspec-
tive; usually more egocentric than before.
'<J" "You definitely think more about your-
self and what you'll do afterwards, especially
when you know who'll be doing your job
afterwards., it's a weird thing having to live
out the last six months when everyday the
next person's being sized up bit by bit. You
know that you'll be involved in decisions that
won't concern you at all; decisions about
things happening five, ten years away.
Maintaining any motivation at that stage is
something. Combine it with the demand for
miracles and perfection and you begin to
& realise why I can never do anything right".
I She isn't complaining about the lack of
1 understanding. Instead she picks up her man-
1 ifesto and smiles at the thought of next year's
I potential who will be making their pitch in
the coming weeks. "You know, I get a lot ol
satisfaction from knowing that all the candi-
dates are talking complete crap' It's conde-
scending but it's not cruel is it?"
I glanced at mv watch and was painfully
aware of the consequences of engaging in fur-
ther discussion.
"No Sarah, that's not cruel at all".
