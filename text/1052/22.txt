Dear Felix,
I am writing to express the
Labour Club's pleasure in noting
that ConSoc has given up on their
own side and started giving free
pulicity to the Labour Party.
We wholeheartedly endorse
ConSoc's assertion in last week's
Felix which stated that the
Labour Party will win the next
General Election.
Stephen Webb
(Labour Club Secretary)
Well... yes... To be honest, I had-
n't read further than the head-
line until you mentioned it, and
assumed it was an ad for the
Labour Club - ConSoc's press
officer should be a little more
careful next time, maybe?
Mind you, any publicity that
the ad provided for Labour was
a little adverse, wouldn't you
agree? Although I have to say,
the only decline of Britain that
I've experienced has been over
the last sixteen years...

Dear Felix,
The Overseas Students
Committee, would like to wish
all those taking part today in
tonight's International Night all
the best.
Tickets will be available
until today from the JCR on
Sherfield level 3, and the Union
Usman Malik
(OSC Events Officer)
Kamal Patel
(OSC Vice President)
Mitul Mistry
(OSC Publicity Officer)
Thanks guys - presumably
there'll be people in the men-
tioned areas all day? Good luck
from Felix as well - you've got a
high standard to maintain, and
I'm sure you'll manage admir-
ably.
To everyone else out there -
the International Night is regu-
larly one of the best-organised,
best run and best executed col-
lege social events of the year. If
you haven't already got a ticket,
I recommend that you seek out
one of the people selling, and
buy tickets for yourself and all
your friends.

Dear Felix
City and Guilds College
Union will be organising a blood
donation session on Monday 4th
March in Southside G y m .
Donations will be taken between
9.45am - 4pm.
More details are available
from the posters around college
or from the City and Guilds
Union office (Mech Eng 340).
New donors are very wel-
come and can register on the day.
Sarah Thomas
C&dGU President
Here's another good idea. I've
been meaing to get myself regis-
tered as a blood donor for some,
time now, and this could be my
opportunity, if I can get over my
inherent laziness, and a phobia
about big needles!
I just hope they don't find
anything unpleasant in my
blood...
