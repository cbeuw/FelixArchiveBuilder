Clean Sheet For Virgins
UCL 0 - 45 ICLRFC
In the London University Cup
Semi-final Imperial College ran
out in confident fashion against
the side previously beaten sixty
nil earlier in the season. The pack
was dominant and won virtually
all the rucks and mauls led by the
rampant Lynsey and Adele. The
backs, led by Sarah, managed to
score eight of the nine tries.
Catherine, the acting captain,
achieved her second hat-trick of
the season with Karen scoring
two and further scores from
Tara, Petra, Adele and Sarah.
UCL's best players were those
they borrowed from IC, a just
reflection on the training, com-
mitment and team spirit of the
strong IC side which gelled well
on the day.

ICLRFC 5 - 26 RHUL
Only thirteen of the Virgins'
were available and this did not
bode well for our second meeting
this season with Holloway, a tra-
ditionally strong side.
As in our first meeting soft
tries were conceded early on,
although defending against a per-
manent overlap was always
extremely difficult.
To our surprise Holloway
did not take advantage of our
lack of a full back, and so the
wingers were not challenged by
high kicks. Sustained pressure
from IC brought about a well
worked try from Sarah Waiman,
half of our front row combina-
tion in the centres. From then on
until the middle of the second
RUGBY
half all the play was in the centre
of the field. Holloway three
quarter attacks were thwarted by
spirited tackling from their IC
opposite numbers, yet IC's back
line created few attacking moves
from the good loose ball won by
their forwards. Toward the end
two further tries were conceded
on each wing by the understand-
ably tired IC thirteen.
Despite the score this match
provided the platform for our
most enjoyable rugby of the sea-
son and the entire team must be
commended for their continued
efforts in the face of adversity.
Holloway should indeed be
disappointed by beating us by a
margin of only three tries.

C&G 8 - 3 RCS
(SPARCS CUP)
After a close first twenty min-
utes the Royal College of
Science broke the deadlock with
a penalty. A brisk riposte by City
and Guilds led to the score being
three all at half time, the engi-
neers scoring through Tom
Salter. In the second half, a well
worked back row move led to
Simon Fuller going over for the
only try. RCS tried to fight back
but were utterly bollocksed by
superb forward play.
With the final score eight
three it was a triumphant return
for ex-C&G captain Stevie
Wilkinson. R S M 'ere we come...

UCHMX 0 - 3 RSM
Following recent emphatic wins
over U C L and RLSB,
Wednesdays comfortable victory
over U C H M X came as no sur-
prise, and leaves them looking in
good shape for the traditional
Cambourne match later this
week.
X-Country women are
particularly good
X-Country's last league race saw
the final placing's top three
women all from IC, with their
team winning the 1st division,
and the men's first team runners
up, with two individuals in the
top seven. The men's second
team gained promotion from the
second division.

Unlucky
IC III 0 - 10 BRUNEL III
It was difficult to discern the
true nature of the match, given
the limited amount of informa-
tion at this chroniclers disposal,
so I am now forced to piece
together what morsels have
come my way.
Firstly, the match was in
some kind of cup. It was a quar-
ter final, and apparently this was
the furthest any IC hockey team
have reached, ever.
Having been approached by
several suited up drunk blokes in
Da Vinci's, I have ascertained
exclusively for Felix that;
a) They lost 10-0,
b) The showers were cold,
c) Poor showing in boat race,
due to point b),
c) The curry was very nice,
d) They're all utterly pissed
Obviously, this does not
make for the world's largest
article.
Never mind, lads...
