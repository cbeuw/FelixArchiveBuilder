Ciders of Distinction
Sainsbury's has introduced a new range of
'traditional premium ciders' called, hilari-
ously enough, "Sainsbury's Ciders of
Distinction". It has four own-label ciders
in it including the first ever Organic Cider
(wool).
Sainsbury's Natural Orchard is
approved by the Soil Association, whether
this means they put dirt in it I don't know,
but it apparently has a 'clean, refreshing
tase, making an excellent accompaniment
to pork dishes.' It's 6.5% a.b.v. and costs
LI .49 for a 500ml bottle.
Sainsbury's West Country Pride is
made from selected West Country apples
(no, really?). It is a good 'all-rounder' and
is reputedly has a 'full character'. It has
5.5% a.b.v. and costs £1.49 for 500ml in a
distinct round bottle.
Sainsbury's Oak Conditioned cider is
a strong dry cider, and is 'an ideal partner
to speciality cheeses' (hmmm). It's also
the cheapest cider at £1.19 for 500ml,
with 5% a.b.v.
Finally, Sainsbury's Old Hereford is a
cloudy, strong, dry cider. When they say
cloudy, they're not kidding - I've seen it!
It's the strongest cider in the range at
7.3% a.b.v. and best accompanies poultry
dishes (what, not big ones...). It is also
available in a 500ml bottle for £1.39.
