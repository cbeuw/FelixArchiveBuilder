•album: sepultura - roots*
I must confess that there was a time when I had
no time for Brazilian thrashers, Sepultura. To me
they were merely Slayer-wannabes with a fine
line in crass, bordering-on-the-Satanic lyrics.
1993's million-plus selling album, 'Chaos A.D.',
however, was much more promising, particularly
the likes of 'Refuse/Resist' which moved away
from the speed and the stupidity and into mid-
paced, controlled power. Now, with their sixth
album, Sepultura have produced a work of stun-
ning cohesion and breathtaking brutality.
Quite simply, 'Roots' is heavier than an ele-
phant with a weight problem and is consequently
not for the migraine-afflicted. Opener and top 20
single, 'Roots Bloody Roots', speaks for the whole
album with its snarling, rabid guitars, 'pour some
hot whisky down my larynx and then mb it with
sandpaper' vocals, and Latin American tribal
dmmming. The latter musical element is a con-
scious decision on the band's part as they have
sought to capture some of the ethos of their
homeland amidst their modem, metallic fury
(hence the album title). Luckily for them, and for
us, it has worked a treat.
'Ratamahatta' is a glorious rush that sees
Sepultura vocalist, Max Cavelera, and Brazilian
percussionist, Carlinhos Brown, exchanging furi-
ous Portuguese lyrics. If you can resist jumping up
and down to the manic percussion and razor-
sharp guitars then you're... well, probably just a
less excitable and more sensible person than I am.
Going back to their roots doesn't just mean
bludgeoning us though. 'Itsari' is an acoustic num-
ber that was recorded with the Xavante tribe in
the Amazon jungle. It is certainly more than a
mere curio and serves as an atmospheric breather
that builds from a delicate intro to an intense yet
sensitive finale. In many ways, the claustrophobia
that the track invokes makes this song 'heavier'
than all of the other, considerably louder, songs on
the album.
Sepultura have successfully come up with a
sixth album that sounds as fresh as if it were their
first, and that incorporates their cultural heritage
in a natural and plain angry sound. As far as I'm
concerned, this is the only jungle music worth
bothering with... (8)
-album: st. germain -
boulevards.pulaski
The man behind St. Germain, Ludovic Navarre,
is a reclusive French misanthrope who doesn't
believe in setting himself easy tasks - to wit, fusing
deep house beats with late-night, jazzy atmos-
pherics. This seemingly perverse notion should be
doomed to failure since jazz and house are pretty
much polar music styles - one relies on musical
freedom and improvisation, where mistakes are
integrated into the whole, while the other uses
rigid beats and synthesised sounds to create a sur-
face perfection. That it isn't a failure is a testa-
ment to Navarre's unique talent.
'Deep In It' opens in style, a glorious, laid-
back groove overlaid with all the basic jazz vibes,
soulful piano, the works. 'Thank U Mum (4
Everything You Did)', despite the appaling title, is
even better - a deep bass-line, shimmering back-
ing and mysterious vocals combining to produce
the warmest sound imaginable. Mummy must be
proud.
It's not all wine and roses, though. 'Street
Love' falls into the old jazz trap of being, well, bor-
ing, while 'Dub Experience IT is nothing more
than a pleasant bit of light dub-reggae, which is as
out of place as you'd imagine.
Minor irritations aside though, this is a
unique, soulful and very cool album. (8)
-gig: echobellyi
lucas
To expectant applause, Echobelly bound onto
stage and go straight for the tunes. There's no
signs of any arrogant posturing or gigantic egos
here.
What hits youfirstand foremost is the music.
But, like the advert for Granary, ifyou're male and
heterosexual you cannot fail to miss the protago-
nist of the proceedings. In this case it's Sonya
Aurora Madan. Her subdy effusive sexuality
expresses itself in some of the kindest and quirki-
est moves. And though she is naturally understat-
ed, paradoxically the sheer energy and exuber-
ance of the music comes through her as if she was
the vessel for it's oh-so-slightly screwed-up
melodies.
Madan has an angelic voice, but unlike that of
a choirboy, there is a certain knowing there, which
she is totally un-self-conscious of. And, like a
shooting star in a starry sky, she stands out.
It was a storming gig. What more can I say?
