Much has already been written on die subject of
Danny Boyle's controversial celluloid adaptation
of Irvine Welsh's highly lauded Trainspwtting'.
Likewise, the accompanying soundtrack has
attracted no small amount of media attention,
having perhaps been more auspiciously advertised
than its parent film.
Unsurprisingly, the heavily-hyped Britpop
presence on the album supplies the slightly weak-
er tracks,

really scores

with the class
of the individ- <

each of the very different styles to create the
film's unmatched atmosphere; that of dreamers
amongst the urban decay, holding to Oscar
Wilde's idea of lying in the gutter to stare at the
stars. This soundtrack accomplishes that with

'Trainspotting' takes the unique atmosphere
of a superb movie and some diverse and bril-
liantly creative music along for the ride. Great
film, top sounds. (9)

this world and body,,™
Marion are a five piece from Macclesfield whose
influences include Joy Division and The Smiths
although they do have their own distinctive sound.
They started their career around the same time as
the current Britpop scene began taking shape, but
by good fortune or not, they have managed to stay
detached from it.
The album begins with the thunderous 'Fallen
Through' and continues in this fashion until the
glorious and uplifting 'Wait'. The album includes
the singles 'Toys For Boys', 'Let's All Go Together',
the most recent one, 'Time', and 'Sleep', which

you may have heard on a certain car advert. The
slow and impressive 'Your Body Lies' stands like an
island amidst a sea of fast and headstrong songs on
a 45-minute album which races by and is over
before you know it.
For such a young band, Marion show a great
deal of maturity in their songwriting but unfortu-
nately they are considerably under-rated and don't
get the credit they deserve. To create an album
with so much passion and of such dynamic pro-
portions is a feat in itself, but to do so on your first
attempt is incredible. Marion have produced a
debut album which will definitely be a worthy
contender for one of the best albums of 1996. (9)
