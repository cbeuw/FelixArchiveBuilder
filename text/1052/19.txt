Express
Yourself!
Are you that rare breed
of IC student who can
I—-v \i i—j y:-;:.: think further than
J 1 .J . fourier translorms and
coefficients of restitu-
tion? That singular ani-
mal who is actually a bit
- well - creative?
If you are, then
phoenix needs you!
phoenix is the annual,
arts publication of IC,
and is your chance to get your work distrib-
uted to the poor, culture-starved masses.
But what sort of art are we talking about
here? Well, just about any! This year we're
taking prose, poetry, stories, artwork, anima-
tions, audio, video, interactive works, and
almost anything else we could distribute!
Don't let the medium restrict you - be cre-
ative and just express yourself.
The suggested theme is 'Manipulation' -
feel free to interpret it as you wish or ignore
it completely, it's just there to provide inspi-
ration if you need it.
This time the editors are Mark and
Jeremy - you can reach us via the Felix
pigeon holes, by phoning or faxing 58072, or
e-mailing mltbl@doc.ic.ac.uk or the soon-
to-be-set-up phoenix e-mail account.
So, if you feel inspired or already have
some work you want to share with the world,
drop in for a chat or even an argument -
either is fine by us!
Just one restriction - we'd like any work
in by the end of this term, 22 March. If this
is no good then come and talk to us, you
might be in luck...
Wargaming
Go into any good hobby or games store these
days and more than likely you'll be confront-
ed by a huge range of playing card-size packs.
This is the new world of Customisable Card
Games (or C C G s to those in the know). The
range of themes is huge: there are games
based on films, T V series (I think you can
guess which ones I'm referring to), games
and books, and others along more fantastical
lines - the list goes on and on. At the rate at
which new games are becoming available, the
list will soon top one hundred.
C C G s work on the principle of having
an initial set of over 300 cards, which are ran-
domly spread though packs. Most of the real-
ly useful cards are 'rare cards', which means
that you only get 2-6 (depending on the
game) in a starter pack of 60 cards (£6 or
upwards); or 1-2 in a booster pack of 8-15
cards (£2). There are also common and
uncommon cards, with equal numbers of
rare, uncommon and common cards in a set.
Once you think you've got a strong
enough deck to compete, the game itself
involves defeating your opponent's deck one
way or another, using the cards properties to
whittle away your opponent's strength while
defending your own.
If you want to collect a set and have a
few duplicate rare cards, there are plenty of
people to trade cards with. Several cards of
different rarity can change hands at one go,
so you need a razor-sharp mind to make the
best deals! If there's no one around to swap
with, you could always put an advert on the
the Internet: the newsgroup rec.games.trad-
ing-cards.marketplace is a good place to start
trading or buying cards. Be careful when buy-
ing, as most deals come from the US and
involve dollars. Some cards can be rather
expensive; a Black Lotus (from the
MagicThe Gathering set), now out of print,
will sell for about £150. Even rare cards
which are still in print, such as a Darth Vader
(from the Star Wars set) can go for around
£35, and it's only been available 5 weeks!
Should any of you start playing a C C G ,
I'm looking for a Darth Vader at the
moment! If you already play a C C G then
come to Wargames club - we have several
Magic, Star Wars, Middle Earth and Star
Trek:TNG players.
