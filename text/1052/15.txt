It's December 30th 1999 - the end of the mil-
lennium is near and, "everything's already been
done, every Government, every hairstyle, every
flavour of bubblegum and cereal. How are we
gonna make it for another thousand years, for
Chrissake?"
Ralph Fiennes plays Lenny Nero, an ex-cop
and dealer in SQUIDs - Superconducting Quan-
tum Interface Devices - playback versions of
people's experiences. These are held on digital
disc, and when played back allow the user not
only to see and hear, but also to feel every single
event. Whatever you want - sex, violence or
thrills - Lenny will get it for you. Anything, that
is, except blackjacks' - the SQUID equivalent of
snuff movies, which become the illegal drug of
choice for many.
Set in Los Angeles, where the streets are
even now rife with gang warfare and police
checkpoints, the film paints a bleak picture of a
future which could be reality in only three years'
time. The execution-style murder of Jeriko One
(Glenn Plummer), a rap star and race rights
activist, pushes the tension on the streets to an
all-time high. Through a series of anonymous
playback clips showing the murder ofJeriko One
and a friend of his, Lenny becomes inextricably
involved in a chain of events which threaten his
own life, but far more important to Lenny is the
possible danger to Faith (Juliette Lewis), a for-
mer girlfriend. Lenny is still in love with Faith,
now a successful singer (Lewis does a pretty
good job of covering PJ Harvey's 'Rid Of Me'
and Hardly Wait'), but Faith no longer has any
feelings for him. She has moved on with her life,
leaving him with only a bottle of vodka and a
shoebox full of playback clips of their time
together. It is up to Lenny, with the help of Mace
(Angela Bassett), to solve the connection
between the two murders while keeping their
lives intact.
Strange Days portrays a dark, often shock-
ing vision of civilisation at the end of the millen-
nium. A soundtrack which contains Deep
Forest, Skunk Anansie, Tricky and plenty of rap
enhances the feelings of extreme unrest on the
streets.
Directed by Kathryn Bigelow {Point Break
and Blue Steel) and written by James Cameron
(The Terminator, Aliens and True Lies), this
contains some exhilarating action scenes and
stunts, some unexpected twists in the storyline
and excellent acting by Fiennes, Bassett and
Lewis. This film is many things, but dull and
tedious it isn't. Go and see it and it may be the
best film you see all year.

In the bar afterwards
Bill: Well that was a big disappointment.
Ben: You mean it was over ambitious, had too
many elements, and Gibson used every SF idea
he had ever had.
Bill: Hmmm. Incorrect ones at that - the short
story was far superior. None of this 'overload'
trash or 'seepage' or false brain 'imagery'.
Ben: Nothing wrong with the imagery! The
point was the human brain can't remember arbi-
trary data - it needs something to relate to. That
'Super Stor' memory doubler was the biggest
load of crap though - for exactly that reason.
Bill: Care of Microsoft! Ok - let's stop being
pseudo-technical here. How about the acting, or
lack thereof?
Ben: I thought Henry Rollins and Ice-T were
good, better than the usual singer-tumed-actor
attempts.
Bill: Ok - but what about the main crowd (ok
girl) puller - K Reeves himself. Without a child-
hood - without a backbone if you ask me.
Ben: Pretty atrocious.
Anonymous girl at bar: Keanu Reeves - what a
hunk!
Bill: See?
Ben: I liked the height of his monologue - "I
want room service!"
Bill: Sure! Right - to round off. Do we general-
ly recommend this, or do we say go and watch
'One Man and His Dog' on T V instead?
Ben: I like that show!
