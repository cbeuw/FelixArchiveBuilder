Made in Heaven
'Some relationships are made in
Heaven' as the saying goes, which
inspired this picture from Alan
Rudolph, formerly of Choose Me
fame. Initially set in the 50s the story
starts with Mike Shea (Timothy
Hutton) having a bad day. Having lost
his job and his girlfriend (who ran off
to marry someone else), Mike sets off
for California to find happiness.
Barely a hundred miles out of town,
he comes across a car accident and
after bravely saving a mother and her
two children, he is unfortunately
drowned.
Heaven, it turns out, is a great place
to be. A late aunt of Mike's welcomes
him to paradise since the man in
charge is busy. Here he accidentally
meets Annie (Kelly McGillis) and
they fall in love. Everyone in Heaven
is waiting to be born and soon Annie
disappears to be born on Earth.
Reluctant to wait his turn, Mike
Live
Johnny Mars Blues Band
Johnny Mars and his band are
currently playing the best blues to be
heard on the pub and club scene since
the heyday of 77ie Blues Band (if you
are old enough to remember them).
Frontman Mars blows his fiery
harmonica and sings with real
presence—when he says he's the
'Number One Playboy' you'd better
believe it!—and he displays his talents
in a varied repetoire, ranging from
slow 12 bar through to ballads and
rock-solid boogie.
His four-piece band is well
rehearsed to the point that Mars'
complex arrangements are tight, but
not so tight that the sense of invention
and fun is gone—their performance
persuades Emmet, (he's not God he
just runs things), to give him thirty
years on Earth to find Annie. Here
we move swiftly through the sixties
with Mike becoming Elmo, an
aspiring musician, while Annie has
become Ally and married. The
chances of them meeting when they
know nothing about each other are
less than slim, but the opportunity for
near misses is cleverly explored.
The film does well to remain
believable, with reliance placed on
imagination and subtlety to good
effect. Heaven really is fun, and here
the film scores admirably by creating
a realistic Utopia. Mostly the
characters are convincing without
being over-sentimental, but this is
stretched at the end. There is plenty
of scope for touches of wit with
unexpected coincidences and timing
tricks which result in an unusual
romantic tale.
A.N.
WSI(T
remains fresh on repeated hearing.
Nor do the players restrict themselves
to the standard blues licks and
tones—the keyboards in particular get
away from the cliched piano/Fender
Rhodes sound employed by most
outfits.
Whether you've never listened to
the blues or you believe that blues
started with Muddy Waters and ended
with Eric Clapton, you'll find the
modern approach of the Johnny Mars
Band an education. Catch them in
November at:
Pizza Express, Dean Street, 29th
100 Club, Oxford Street, 16th
Pied Bull, Islington, 10th, 17th
and 24th

Roxanne
Roxanne is the latest production
starring the talented American
comedian, Steve Martin. Also written
by Martin, it is a modern portrayal
of the classic Rostand character,
Cyrano de Bergerac, cast in the form
of a small Northwest American town
fire chief, C D . Bales.
'CD' has everything, he is a
popular and respected member of the
community, he has a nice house and
a good job (all this and he's hot a
yuppie!). But he also has a problem,
his exceedingly large nose. Over the
years C D has learnt to deal effectively
with people who are unwise enough
to make adverse comment, and this
generates endless run, notably the big-
nose joke-telling duel C D has with a
drunken taunter ('Did your parents
lose a bet with God?'). What he
cannot deal with is his affection for
young astronomy student , Roxanne
(Daryl Hannah). Feeling that she will
laugh at him, he woos her through
another m a n , the hunky and
wonderfully dumb Chris (Rick
Rossovich), whose letters he writes,
and even whose conversation he
invents (another hilarious scene).
Roxanne, of course, falls in loVe with
Chris, believing him to be the
intelligent and romantic author of the
letters, and C D has no choice but to
prolong the deception.
Although the plot is reasonably
predictable this is still a hugely
enjoyable film. The atmosphere and
pace are relaxed and the comedy is
never forced. Steve Martin is faultless
as the zany, sympathetic, loveable
guy whom nature has cursed,
conjouring up almost every emotion
in the audience. Daryl Hannah is
gorgeous, as ever, although I found
it rather hard to believe her as a
genius PhD student. Also along for
all the fun is the wonderful Shelly
Duvall, still without the starring role
she deserves, playing C D ' s friend
Dixie. Even if you've never seen
Steve Martin before, I advise you to
see this film as it is Undoubtedly his
best yet. W
Roxanne opens today."'\
