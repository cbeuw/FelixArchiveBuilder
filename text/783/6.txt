For your deligh
and delectation
Here we are again after a week's
absence from these pages with news
of the last Ents event before Rag take
over for the next three weeks. Well
on Saturday November 7 we will be
presenting an evening of Comedy and
Cabaret in the Lounge Bar which will
be on the same format as the Freshers'
Week event.
The evening features Mark Thomas
a fast and exceptionally funny stand
up, John Maloney the highly
entertaining accordian player and a
special performance by impressionist
and new-comer Simon Cartwright.
On top of this there will be a very
cheap bar and any profits made on the
door go straight to Rag. The whole
thing costs just £1.50 or 50p with an
Ents card. Doors open at 8.30pm and
the first act starts at 9pm.
After Rag Week we have three
more events: Thursday November 26
brings an evening of soul and rhythm
'n' blues with Howlin' Wilf and the
Vee Jays, December 3 sees the 'real'
sound of Africa in the Lounge and
finally Saturday December 12
features a comedy night.

lag Mag makes
a come back
By the time the next issue of F E L I X
appears the IC Rag Mag should have
made a welcome come back after a
lapse of two years. The production of
the IC Rag Mag was one of the most
rewarding tasks I've ever undertaken.
The encouragement and support I
received from many people helped my
task as Rag M a g Editor to be a
pleasant one. I owe my sincere thanks
to all those people who helped me
with the Rag Mag be it typesetting,
pasting-up, artwork, writing material
or whatever. Indeed without the help
I received, I would have been
extremely hard pressed to produce a
good Rag Mag.
I shall not mention names here, as
to do so would be to run the risk of
repeating the credits in the Rag Mag
but thank you all once again.
Gehan de Silva Wiseyeratne,
Editor, IC Rag Mag 87/88
P.S. For those who want an
autographed Rag M a g , I will be
selling Rag Mags on Monday
November 16 in T H E J C R at the Sri
Lankan 'Drink a Cup of Tea for Rag'
stall.

Now we've all had time to settle in,
I thought I'd take this opportunity to
remind you that I am your
Undergraduate Women's Officer. I
can be contacted via my pigeonhole
in the Union Office or the Maths
Undergraduate pigeonholes.
I sent out a letter to undergraduate
and postgraduate women at the
beginning of term. If you want to go
back to your school to talk about
women in science, please contact me
(it doesn't matter if you lost the
'official' reply slip). I will then pass
your name on to Sandra Dawson
(College Senior Tutor for Women, 53
Prince's Gate) who will send you the
relevant forms.
If you live out and are worried
about travelling alone at night, give
me your name, address and phone
number, and I will try and put you in
touch with other women in your area.
This, of course, depends on their
response.
There are free rape alarms available
to women from the Union Office and
a self-defence course should be
organised soon. If there is anything
else the Union should be doing, in
your opinion, then let me know.
Ideas, suggestions, comments and
critcisms are always welcome.
Finally, if there is anyone interested
in being involved in the running of
W I S T (Women in Science &
Technology) then please contact me
or Helen Fitzpatrick (PG Women's
Officer, Chem Eng PG).

Have you got more problem
sheets than anyone else, or
are they just bigger problems?
You are sure that there is more to college life than
problem sheets. But you never seem to have any
time between finishing one and starting the next
to find out exactly what.
You would like to meet other people but
they are too busy with their own work. Your own
social life is becoming a problem sheet which
you cannot solve.
'Come to me all you who are
heavy laden and I will give you rest"
We know someone who specialises in
making light of other peoples' problems. In fact
few things are of greater concern to Him. If you
would like to know more, keep an eye on this
space over the next few weeks.
