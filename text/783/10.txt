Although Rag
Week is a time for
great fun to be had
by all, it is very
easy to lose sight
of the aim of Rag:
to raise money for
charity. The street
collections are to
support charities
that will not benefit
directly from the
money collected
and put in IC Rag
coffers. Any money
which is raised
during Rag Week
will be distributed
among five national
charities which
were chosen by the
Rag Committee last
term.
The British Institute for Brain
Injured Children (BIBIC)
BIBIC was founded in 1972 and now
operates from Knowle Hall near
Bridgewater in Somerset. BIBIC
helps children who have been
diagnosed as spastic, autistic,
retarded, mentally handicapped,
backward, cerebral palsield,
mongoloid, slow, educationally
subnormal, epileptic or dyslexic.
These problems may stem from a
brain injury which occured before or
during birth, through virus infection
or vaccine damage, or as a result of
an accident at home, on the road, or
at play. BIBIC's goal is to improve
the quality of life of all their brain
injured children. To this end, they
aim for the day when they will
function in every respect at the same
level as their peers, and be able to
survive independently in • the real
world.
It should be noted that after the age
of about twelve the brain cells that are
continually dying are no longer being
replaced, in this respect we are all
brain injured, it's just the extent of
injury that is different.
The Muscular Dystrophy Group of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland
M u s c u l a r Dystrophy causes
progressive muscle wasting, and in its
worst form leads to an almost total
loss of voluntary movement. The
Muscular Dystrophy group raises
money to finance medical research
into the cause, treatment and cure for
the many forms of M u s c u l a r
Dystrophy and allied neuromuscular
diseases. It also provides support to
all those who are affected by these
diseases.
Quest for a Test for Cancer
Quest's research into early cancer
detection includes work at the Galton
Laboratory which is part of
University College here in London.
Research is currently being conducted
into screening methods to detect
genetic predisposition to cancer. The
cancers being studied include colon,
thyroid and testcular, some of which
can also affect children.
Shelter
Shelter is a charity that aims to help
London's homeless, a problem that is
increasing at a rapid rate, especially
among young adults. IC Rag's
support of Shelter has been chosen to
coincide with National Homeless
Year which begins in January.
The Terrence Higgins Trust
The Terrence Higgins Trust is an
organisation that gives advice and
councelling to anyone, not just
sufferers, about AIDS. AIDS is a
problem that is going to become a lot
worse before advances can be made.
Any attempt at education must be
supported, especially if it can break
down some of the prejudices that have
unfortunately arisen.
I hope you will agree with some,
if not all, of our choices
Nigel D Baker,
IC Rag Chairman.
Drag queen
contest
You must be aware by now that Rag
Week is almost upon us. You may
not, however, be aware that you may
have a chance to become 'Miss
Imperial College 1987' during Rag
Week. This is no usual beauty contest
though, as it is open to only a selected
few. Well, actually it's open to 80%
of the College, because the title you
will be competing for is that of 'Drag
Miss IC 1987'!
In order to organise this contest,
which will happen at about 10.30pm
during the Rag and Drag Disco on
November 13,1 will need to have all

the Beer Festival).
On your entry please state:
1. Name and Department/Year
2. Vital statistics (just the usual
ones please).
3. Hobbies and interests.

same lines as the usual 'Miss World'
competition and the winner will
receive suitable liquid reward, with
second and third place receiving a
Rag t-shirt and all winners will get
free entry to all the remaining events.
