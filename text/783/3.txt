Firstly, I must apologise for the poor
quality and lack of pages in this
week's issue. Our main printing press
broke down last week in the middle
of printing F E L I X 782. This will not
be fixed until next week. Luckily we
have a very, very, very old back up
machine which got last and this
week's FELIXs out. But this machine
also broke down on Friday! This
means that the Print Unit has been out
of action since then. We managed a
bodge job on the old machine and
decided that it was better to get a bad
quality F E L I X out rather than no
F E L I X at all.
As regards the Print Unit, we are
battling to fulfil our printing
obligations—at least it means that our
posters will be eyecatching!
Secondly, I must apologise to all
the people who submitted articles,
reports, etc for this week's issue
which we were unable to print due to
the lack of space.

Over the weekend I was taken aside
by the Selkirk subwarden and told of
the proposal to turn Selkirk and
Tizard into 'postgraduate only' halls.
I was therefore exceptionally annoyed
to find out that our President Ian
Howgate had known of these
proposals for at least a week before
this but had not thought to inform
anybody. At the U G M on Tuesday he
reported that it was to be decided at
Wednesday's Student Residence
Committee (SRC). He then asked for
comments from the floor! It was the
overwhelming feeling of the U G M
that not enough open discussion had
taken place and a motion was passed
which asked Union reps to call for a
deferal of any decision at the S R C
meeting. It came as no surprise to me
that M r Howgate is totally in favour
of the College's plan for the halls. I
think that it is scandalous that he tried
to leave any discussion until the last
minute and that he hasn't gone to the
halls to find out what postgraduates
and residents of Selkirk/Tizard think
of the plans. And why wasn't the
student newspaper told of this until
after last week's issue came out?

I'm not in favour of any sort of
segregation. H o w e v e r , most
postgraduates I have spoken to have
welcomed College's idea. M y only
thoughts are that Selkirk and Tizard
are better suited to undergraduates
and their needs. Perhaps the newly
acquired houses in Evelyn Gardens
would be a better choice?

The College Policeman, A n d y Nimmons, was presented with a farewell
gift by College Security on Thursday. P C Nimmons, who has been with
Gerald Road Police Station for three years, will be taking up a new post
in Greenwich from Monday.
During his placement in the College A n d y has been very involved i n
combatting bicycle thefts, and thefts of other personal property from
College premises. He recounts amongst his most traumatic experiences
being kidnapped for Rag and having to address the Freshers at the Rector's
Reception.
Security Chief Geoff Reeves praised A n d y for his work at Imperial and
Terry Bridley of Security commented that Andy was a 'good traditional
policeman, persistent, very diplomatic and extremely helpful.
P C Duncan L a w , also of Gerald Road Station, will be taking over as
the new College Policeman.
