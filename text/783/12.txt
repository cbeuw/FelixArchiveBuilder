IC equalise in dying minutes
Surrey lsts—1
IC lsts—2
Having Phil Oliver out with a broken
ankle, John Stonham out with a
cracked finger and Hari Vamadevan
! still sporting a swollen lip, it was a
! stretched and battered IC side that
travelled to play Surrey lsts at
Guildford last Wednesday. Although
IC tried to play their usual flowing
hockey, a poor pitch and inept
umpiring provided as much
opposition as the inferior Surrey
team. Abusing the lax umpiring, IC
set about the unprotected Surrey side.
Paul Coleman, Mark Lewis (warned),
Skipper Justin Brooking, 2nd team
skipper Andy Lewis and goalie Simon
Chittendon (warned) were all lucky
not to get their marching orders.
Although they only had two shots
throughout the game, it was Surrey
who led 1-0 at half-time, against the
run of play. With every player giving
100%, IC fought back with Paul
Skipworth equalising from a Wright
cross. He then scored the winner from
a penalty corner, giving IC an
excellent victory and Skipworth his
sixth goal in five games.
Boat
IC 1st—2
RSM 1st—2
The season has started slowly for IC
who have not been able to find any
sort of form so far. This was a crucial
match for IC who, after being
knocked out of the Cup, needed a
good win in the League to regain
confidence.
RSM started the match determined
and prepared to chase anything while
IC did not show any suchfirein their
game. The chasing and hassling paid
off when RSM scored from a corner.
Although IC created a few chances,
they were unable to hit the back of the
net. In the 36th minute RSM scored
again: a one-two combination which
managed to beat the defence.
IC started the second half in a
different spirit, stringing passes
together and creating space which was
elusive to them in the first. The
pressure paid off when Edward
Collision Head on
Watney's Fours Head of the River
On Sunday, two Imperial teams raced
at the Watney's Fours Head, a warm
up for The Fours Head in two weeks
time. The crews were entered in the
Senior A coxed and coxless divisions
in a field of some 45 crews.
The Senior A coxless four started
fifth and after only about one minute
were in the process of overtaking a
Thames Tradesman's crew when the
two crews collided (not due, this time
to the serpent-like steering of V
Roper) losing IC over 15 seconds
before they could continue. Despite
this IC finished second overall only
a few second behind the winners and
won the Senior A coxless fours
division.
The Imperial coxed four also rowed
well despite only just getting their
boat repaired in time for the race and
finished a good fourth being the
fastest coxed four.
Coates hit a volley from outside the
box into the top right-hand corner of
the net. With IC exerting even more
pressure on RSM's defence it looked
only a matter of time before another
goal.
In the 65th minute RSM's captian
was pulled up for a foul and argued
with the referee. This lead to him
being sent off which was a big blow
for a struggling team. With IC piling
on the pressure, RSM were defending
well until Nigel Collier was awarded
a penalty which he just managed to
place out of the goalies reach. With
RSM defending well IC could not
penetrate their defence until the dying
minutes of the game when Adam
Thomas headed the ball home only to
hear thefinalwhistle go and the goal
to be disallowed. Thefinalscore was
2-2.
Cross Country
British Rail win
This article was meant to give results
from both York and UC relays.
However after an abortive attempt to
reach York thanks to British Rail, the
York team appeared on Parliament
Hill five minutes before the UC
Relays. The start had to be delayed
while a last minute entry was put in
and the numbers reallocated to
produce first and second teams.
Once everyone was on the starting
line though, the pre-race panic died
down and everyone had good runs
over an undulating, but fairly short
course. We have no official results at
the moment but the race was won by
Southampton with both Imperial
teams putting up credible
performances.
Sailing
Alternative men
This weekend we took a ladies and
mens team to sail against UCA.
The first race, for the mens team
was quite eventful with Apostolos
Leonidhopoulos proving he was
worthy of his committee position,
before the start, with help from his
crew Jenny Burton. The mens team
then went on to sail a very close race
The ladies team then went out for
their first race of the season and
despite the fact that Carol Eastwick
hadn't helmed forfiveyears, went on
to win.
The alternative mens team then
went on to beat UEA's mens team,
much to the embarassment of the first
team.

UAU matches
Ourfirstmatch was against Sussex
University and IC walked away with
an easy victory 9-0. What was nice
was that our opponents gave all of our
pairs a good warm up for the coming
season, and a vital opportunity to get
used to each other. This was
particularly important considering
that the crucial match against Surrey
was due to be played the following
week.
As it turned out we were well
beaten by Surrey who have again got
quite a strong team. The deciding
factor was the pace at which the
Surrey pairs played which was
considerably faster than anyone at IC
was prepared for. However, our lsts,
Sean Mulshaw and Simon Hughes,
did manage to win 2 rubbers, one Of
which was a deserved victory against
Surrey's lsts. The rubber lasted 1 !4
hours, Sean and Simon eventually
winning 14-18, 18-16, 18-16.
Despite defeat for this 1st team, the
2nds kept their heads up and managed
to beat Surrey 6-3. Richard Langford
and Alastair McMaster won all 3 of
their rubbers and emphasised this by
the fact that there are more than just
6 players capable of playing in the
first team.
Rugby
Technical defeat
IC 1st—7
Rosslyn Park 3rd—12
IC's first run out against a club side
resulted in a moral, if not points
victory.
Despite playing against a massive
beer-sodden pack IC managed to win
a steady supply of ball for the backs
IC backs adapted to the wet and
windy conditions better than the
opposition and ran in the only try of
the match. Mike Anderson threw a
xxx pass to the fullback, J F Blamo
(ex-France, Barbarians under TK, etc)
who broke through the defence and
supplied Jimmy Sniffshark with an
easy scoring opportunity.
Marsh refereeing meant a stream of
dubious penalties for Rosslyn Park
four of which were converted to give
Rosslyn Park a hollow victory.
