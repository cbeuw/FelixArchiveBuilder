I I I ^^v.
up at the R C S Union Office at 9pm.
j Remember this event is open to
everyone, not just RCS. A l l totals will
| count towards t-shirts and sweatshirts.
• Sci F i Soc also hold a marathon on
this day. This starts at 1pm in the
U D H so all the Dr Who, Blakes 7 and
Star Trek freaks can get their annual
fix. i . f

t Sunday
i Everywhere, November 75, all day
©Sunday has traditionally been a day
of relaxation and recouperation before
the excesses of Week Two, but not
this year. At 1 lam in Princes Gardens
there's a three way tug-of-war
between the C C U s (yes, Rag do own
Charles Brereton's Piano Marathon
JCR, November 17, 6pm
• Each year Charles Brereton
undertakes a sponsored piano
marathon. This year he aims to play
for forty hours with only a five minute
break each hour. Hopefully you will
have already contributed at the
Freshers' Dinners but if you haven't
you will find Chas in the J C R for a
couple of days. This should be very
interesting especially considering the
venue of the next event.
RSM Dirty Disco
JCR, November 17, 8.30pm
• A Dirty Disco organised by the
miners. I can't say much except that
a three-way rope!). Then there's the
Inter-CCU Exec Raft Race where the
three C C U Execs race from College
up to the Serpentine, across it and
hack-.
• Afterwards we all retire to the
Union Bar where Jelly, the Bar
Manager, has put on a promotion for
the lunchtime and the infamous Chaps
curries will be available.
• A new event occurs at 2pm in the
Concert Hall, a Celebrity Charity
Auction. A g a i n this has been
organised by R C S and items to be
auctioned include, a football signed
by all the players from Spurs and a
programme signed by D i a g o
Maradonna. It is hoped that a
qualified auctioneer will do the
business so it should be quite a good
laugh.
• T h e evening sees the IC Rag
Barnight. Cheap beer, silly games,
need I say more?
C & G Slave Auction
ME 220, November 16, 1pm
• W o u l d you like to own Dave Tyler
for a day? No! Would you like to own
Tanya 'I'll do it for £200' Maule for
a day? Yes! Well this is your
opportunity to buy a slave for a day
and.get the last five week's washing
done. Prices range from about £5 to
about £50 depending on who's for
sale and who's buying. I'm sure
Guilds Rugby will make their usual
sexist purchase but there'll be enough
to go round! Some lucky person will
even get a hunky, macho Rag
Chairman with only one previous
owner. ('Good as new'...Automarts).
Open to everyone irrespective of
C C U .
there's a bar extension till midnight
and that anything goes and if past
years are anything to go by, they
certainly will.
• During the course of the evening
the three C C U Execs and I C U Exec
will return from their initiative test.
They will have been tied together in
pairs and dumped 70-80 miles from
London with nothing but a Rag can
and one lOp in case of emergencies.
They will then race back to College
collecting as they go and, as ever,
there will be alcoholic prizes for the
winners.
Morphy Day
CCU Offices, November 18, lpm
• In the past Morphy Day has
consisted of various rowing races
which take place on the Thames near
the Boat Club's boathouse. This was
usually accompanied by a pitch battle
that took place between the C C U s on
the towpath. This battle has caused a
lot of ill feeling in previous years so
last year the whole of Morphy Day
changed. The three C C U Execs
decided that a better Morphy Day
would be a race between the
presidents to,see who could be the
first to get a total stranger to go to
Harrods for afternoon tea. This was
good fun for those involved but it was
a little restricted! This year the boat
races will again take place with the
Rugby Club's racing for the Morphy
Oar. There will also be a race
between the Execs including the I C U
Exec. Afterwards everyone will go to
Harrods where we'll all play silly
sports outside before going in for
afternoon tea.
Drink a P u b D r y
Union Bar, November 18, 6pm
• No explanation required. Meet 6pm
in the Union Bar before moving off
to a very special pub this year.
Exec Torture
Beit Quad, November 19, 12.30pm
• Have you ever felt like throwing
unspeakable things at Ian Howgate or
Gordon Brignall? Well, the Exec
Torture is your chance to show the
C C U and I C U Execs just how popular
they really are! There's a Rag
Chairman who'll be getting his
revenge first on a couple of members
of the R C S Exec. The torture starts
at 12.30pm and you bring along
anything you want to pour or throw.
The more horrible or nasty it is, the
more you pay to Rag!
R C S Smoking Concert
Concert Hall, November 19, 7.30pm
• The Smoking Concert is one of
those events that cannot adequately be
described on paper, so I won't try. A l l
I'll say is that it takes place in the
Concert Hall and anyone who's
anyone in College will get up on the
stage and make a total pillock of
themselves. For some this is easier
than others, isn't it Ian?! A l l the Execs
will be doing a sketch and the Rugby
Club sketches are normally quite
memorable. This year everyone
should remember to bring some extra
cash along so we can raise £200 so
that Tanya Maule, the Guilds V P , will
do a solo sketch. (She's going to kill
me!)
AeroSoc Darts/Monster Boatrace
Beit Quad, November 20, lpm
close-by over the weekend go down
and throw a few arrows as help is
always welcomed!
C & G Carnival
Union Building, November 20, 8pm
• Rag Week '87 goes out with a
bang. Carnival is the end to Rag
Week and is probably the best party
you'll go to in your time at College.
It's run on the lines of the Freshers'
Ball and New Year's Party and at only
£3.50 a ticket everyone can afford to
go. This year it will have a sixties
theme so dig out your dad's old gear
and come to the party of the year.
Remember, it's the last event so you
can sleep tomorrow and then catch up
with all those problem sheets!
Southside Cocktails
Southside Bar, November 20, 7pm
• Enjoy a delicious, potent Southside
Cocktail while you throw a few
arrows for Rag
So there it is, Rag Week '87, twenty-
five events in eleven days, I'll be .at
all of them and for anyone who aims
to do the same Rag are offering a
special deal on entry to the events.
This year we are selling Rag Week
'87 tickets for only £10 which covers
entry to:
• Beer Festival
• Hypnosis Lecture
• Rag & Drag Disco
• S C A B Night
• Dirty Disco
• Smoking Concert
• Carnival
Individual entry would come to £15
and so the week long tickets are well
worth buying. They are available
• AeroSoc Darts; pay a nominal fee
to throw paper darts off the top of the
Union Building with prizes being
given for the longest, furthest,
funniest, etc.
• After the darts, the three C C U ' s
boat race each other. Mines normally
win but then they normally have about
one third the number of people that
C & G or R C S have.
1,000,001 Down Darts
Southside Bar, November 20, 6pm
• Two teams of darts players race
each other to score 1,000,001.
They'll end at about 6am Monday
morning so if you're in Southside or
from myself and all members of the
Rag Committee which includes the
C C U V P s .
A lot of people have asked me
about t-shirts and the Rag M a g . T-
shirts will be on sale at all the events
so bring your £3.50 for a limtied
edition 'Lemmings Fate '88' t-shirt.
The Rag M a g is, as I write, being
printed. It arrives back on Monday
and will be on sale at the Beer
Festival.
It only remains for me to encourage
everyone to join in as it's normally
the first years who make Rag Week.
Have fun!
Nigel D Baker,
ICU Rag Chairman.
