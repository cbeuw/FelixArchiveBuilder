Internal exile
Tatyana Velikanova, a mathemati-
cian, has been an outspoken advocate
of human rights since the early 1970s.
She was arrested in 1979 and
convicted of editing A Chronicle of
Current Events, the oldest Samizdat
publication on human rights in the
USSR. Velikanova was sentenced to
four years imprisonment and five
years internal exile. H e r
imprisonment was spent in the Small
Zone, a special unit for women
political prisoners in Mordovia.
It is a tribute to the courageous
mutual support that has sprung up
between the women prisoners that
hunger-strikes and other non-violent
action is used as a means to protest
against ill-treatment of prisoners. In
August 1983 Velikanova and Irina
Ratushinskaya, the poetess,
conducted a hunger strike to support
a prisoner in 'solitary'. They were
handcuffed and force-fed by six men,
then left for five days in a windowless
cell to recover from the after-effects
of the feeding procedure. Velikanova
is now serving internal exile in a
remote part of Kazakh SSR. She is
now fifty-five years old and suffers
from hypertension, angina, arthritis
and ischaemia. She is not due to be
released until November 1988 unless
people appeal on her behalf.
If you wish to appeal, please send
courteous letters appealing for her
release. Write to:

Under the arches
One of the traditional places in
London for the homeless to sleep is
soon to be no more. T h e
Embankment, also known as
Cardboard City, is being closed down
as the area goes upmarket. Its last
residents are unlikely to be allowed
back after Christmas.
The I C C A G Soup-Run is a drop in
the ocean but it's better than nothing.
Come and meet some ordinary people
down on their luck—any Thursday
9.15pm, start from Week's Hall
Basement. Everyone welcome. 'Under the arches', by a resident
CHOIR
Punch, pianos and song
On Saturday 24th October a coach
and a fleet of cars bearing I C Choir
descended into the rolling autumnal
countryside of the North Downs to
take over Bedgebury Prep School for
a weekend of singing and socialising.
Our arrival at the red brick building
set in attractive, though wind-
battered, grounds was greeted with
tea and biscuits but we soon got down
to work with our first rehearsal in the
school gym. This term we are
preparing the glories of Haydn's Four
Seasons and the Bach Christmas
Oratorio for our concert on 11th
December. (A date for your diaries.)
Lunch was followed by a free
afternoon in which the bright sun
tempted a lot of people outside to
explore the local village and country
lanes. The abundance of pianos
provided some welcome relief from
the (may we hope, temporary) lack of
practice facilities in College. Some
made a trip to Bodium Castle, whilst
others were content to soak up the sun
on the benches on the terrace.
We reconvened for yet more tea
and Danish pastries and another
rehearsal at which our sight reading
was sorely tested by Haydn's Summer
Storm and our tongues grappled with
the German pronounciation. Supper
brought back mixed memories of
school meals and then our evening
rehearsal was followed by a party.
Yet more food and a magical punch
concoction sent us out to gather
around a bonfire in good spirits. It
was a clear night and the bonfire
burned magnificently sending
glowing sparks high into the air.
Spontaneous singing erupted of a very
alternative nature to our previous
exertions, definitely neither Haydn or
Bach and including some amusing
improvisations.
The Sunday morning rehearsal
consequently took off rather slowly
but we worked hard until lunch,
breaking, of course, for mid-morning
tea and biscuits. Those who were not
drawn out into the sun after lunch
listened to a recording of our
performance of Handel's Dixit
Dominus last M a y .
At our final rehearsal we went over
everything we had learnt over the
weekend. Another cup of tea
preceded the return trip to London
through the Sunday evening traffic
and a hazy pink sunset. W e look
forward to sharing the fruits of our
labours with you in December.

Francis Ford Cappola (Director of
The Godfather, Apocolypse Now and
The Cotton Club) is the Director of
this highly acclaimed comedy-drama,
a sort of thinking man's Back to the
Future. Kathleen Turner {Romancing
the Stone) plays Peggy Sue, a house
wife in the present day who wonders
if perhaps things would have turned
out differently for her if she hadn't
got married. Then, suddenly, she
finds herself transported back in
time—and she has her chance to
change the course of her life. This is
a thought- provoking film, mixed with
appealing comedy; a film about love
and life, and a chance to change them
both.
