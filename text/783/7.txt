Next Wednesday
sees the beginning
of eleven days of
chaos which
masquerade under
the title of Rag
Week '87. This
year many events
have been
resurrected to make
the next few weeks
the busiest for
many a year. For
those who have yet
to experience Rag
Week IC style, Rag
Chairman Nigel
Baker gives a short
(!?!) resume of
what can be
expected.
R C S Beer Festival
JCR, November 11, Noon
• The Beer Festival has been the
traditional start to Rag Week and this
year is no exception. Entry to the
Festival costs £2 and for this you
receive a 'Lemming's Fate '88' pint
glass for use during the day. There
will be about 35 beers, ales and ciders
on sale ranging in price from 70p to
98p per pint. Many of the popular
beers sell out early, so a firkin of each
is usually held back until about
5.30pm. This gives the sporty types
a chance to try them when they return
from their matches. Once the QT
Burger Bar shuts the Scout and Guide
Club and the Chaps Club will be
selling curries and burgers, which are
not only cheaper than QT, but also
generate some extra money for Rag.
Killer
Everywhere, November 11, Midnight
• The idea behind the Killer game is
very simple. Everyone who wants to
play registers by filling in an entry
form and enclosing a couple of
photos. These photos are then given
to other participants who try to 'kill'
their target. This is done by the use
of water pistols, etc. Hopefully by the
end of Rag Week there'll be two
people left who are trying to kill each
other. There are some very good
prizes on offer which have been
donated by the Virgin Megastore and
other games suppliers.
Hypnosis Lecture
Great Hall, November 12, 7.30pm
• The Hypnosis Lecture has, in
recent years, grown from a fringe
• After the problems that were
encountered with the Hitsquad at last
year's Festival it has been decided that
Hitsquad will not be allowed to
operate in the J C R this year, so you
can get legless in peace.
event to become one of the highlights
of the week. Martin S Taylor, a magic
circle hypnotist, brings his own brand
of humour and entertainment to a
subject that has baffled and
mesmerized people for centuries. The
first half-hour is taken up with a talk
by Martin about hypnosis, its history
and uses. The next two and a half
hours see Martin hypnotising over
100 people en masse. It's a sight that
just has to be seen; but remember
'Polywog'!
Rag and Drag Disco
JCR, November 13, 8.30pm
• T h e Rag and Drag Disco is the first
'theme party' of the week and it offers
an opportunity for all the closet
transvestites to come into the open.
This year there will be the first 'Miss
Drag Queen of I C competition which
will take place during the evening
with mega-prizes for the winners
(entry details elsewhere in this issue).
There's a lam bar extension with no
lectures to get up for next morning so
a great night will be had by all. If
there's anyone with a pair of size ten
stilettoes could they please let me
know.
S C A B Night
Concert Hall, November 14, 7.30pm
• S C A B NighCis an event whereby
all the performing societies in
College, from Dramsoc and Opsoc to
Jazz and Rock Club, come together
and perform on the same stage in the
same evening. The performances are
of a very high standard as the clubs
rehearse for weeks beforehand. This
year's show is timetabled to last over
five hours and it is great value at only
£2 a ticket.
• Also on the first Saturday there is
a 24 hour street collection organised
by R C S . (Don't worry it's only
slightly illegal as collecting shouldn't
continue after dusk!) This year the
collection will take place outside
Harrods, along Oxford Street and in
Leicester Square and is in aid of
Amnesty International. Anyone
interested in taking part should see
Fiona Nicholas, the RCS V P , or turn
