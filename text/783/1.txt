SURREY PRESIDENT CALLS FOR NATIONAL COLLEGE BAN FOR IMPERIAL STUDENTS
Breaking the rules
ACCUSATIONS of sexism, racism and 'riotous behavior' were made
against Imperial College sports teams, who visited the University of Surrey
last Wednesday for University Athletics Union (UAU) matches. The
Football, Hockey and Rugby teams were involved in the incidents, which
took place in the Student Union Bar at the University, in the evening after
the sports fixtures.
As the evening progressed some of
the students who stayed behind
disrupted Surrey's annual " U n i o n
Quiz N i t e " by shouting out answers
and heckling. Some also dived off the
balcony of the bar, and during a song
members o f the Rugby team
undressed, offending some Surrey
women students present. Plastic
glasses were thrown, and Surrey
claim 200 glasses were broken during
the evening. They also claim that
racist remarks were made to some
overseas students present, and fights
were started, although this is disputed
by the Imperial teams.
The President of their Students'
Union, Andy Young, decided to shut
the bar at 9.10pm because of the
disturbance. However, some of the
Imperial students then tried to force
entry to a private disco going on in
another part of the building. M r
Young then set off the fire alarm in
order to clear the building. Surrey
claim that some students still refused
to leave, although the visting teams
said they were only trying to reclaim
their kit first.
Once outside the Bar, a further
Â£400 of damage was caused by the
Imperial students when a shopping
trolley full of people was pushed
through a plate glass window of a
restaurant on the campus.
A motion was taken to Surrey's
Union General Meeting ( U G M ) on
Tuesday by their President. It called
for the banning of all Imperial
Students from their building, and
imposed conditions for allowing any
visiting sports teams into their Union
building. Due to strong opposition to
the motion by Surrey's own sports
teams, the motion was defeated by a
small majority.
Surrey's President was very upset
with the behavior of the visiting
students. He was quoted in Surrey's
newspaper "Bare Facts" as saying
" N o member of a visiting sports team
from Imperial will ever set foot in this
place again while I'm here". When
contacted by F E L I X , he said he was
not sure of his next move after his
U G M motion was thrown out. He
admitted that he had not contacted
Imperial officially yet, although he
"might d o " soon. The motion, had
it been passed, would have mandated
him to write to Imperial "deploring
the behaviour of our the students"
and sending them a bill for the
damage caused. He added that he
would like to see Imperial students
"banned from every College in the
country", and that he was in contact
with his regional N U S about possible
further action.
The Surrey Deputy President,
however, is very unhappy with the
bad feeling that the incident is
causing. He told F E L I X that "it was
helping no o n e " and that he was
surprised and sorry that their
President had not been in touch with
Imperial yet. He felt that with the
