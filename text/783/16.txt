Postgraduate room reshuffle
Continued from front page
right attitudes the incidents could be
quickly cleared up.
Imperial President Ian Howgate
acted quickly when he heard of the
trouble. A l l the clubs involved have
submitted written reports of what
happened, which are being sent to
Surrey. Union Officers at Imperial are
unhappy that they still have not heard
anything official from Surrey, and
that there has been no chance to put
the Imperial's side of the story
forward.
Athletics Clubs Committee Chair
Robert Gee told F E L I X that, once the
facts were sorted out, if anyone had
done anything wrong, the appropriate
action would be taken against them.
The sports clubs claim that closing
the bar early, at 9.10pm, was "asking
for trouble" as the coaches booked
to take the players home was not due
until 10.30pm. In the past it has been
the practice to stagger the leaving time
of the coaches, to give students a
choice of how long to stay after the
match. On this occasion, the coaches
only left at 5.30pm after the game,
and at 10.30pm, prompting members
of the Badminton team to catch the
train home in the mid-evening. There
was a feeling that if the coaches had
been staggered, some of the students
would have left earlier and some of
the problems would have been
avoided.
The first 'free chips' U G M took place
in the J C R on Tuesday and was the
first quorate U G M of this academic
session.
I C U President Ian Howgate
reported verbally that he was pushing
for an entertainments fund to be set
up for the residents of Hamlet
Gardens who are getting a 'raw deal'
at the moment. H e wants £800 to
come from the residents' fund and
£200 from College funds. He also
reported that the Union does not yet
have control of the proceeds from the
sale of Harlington gravel, although
the Union have stopped College
administration using the interest from
any investments.
Deputy President A l a n Rose
reported that Union Snack Bar prices
would be increasing as reported in last
week's F E L I X . After the Hon Sec

Selkirk and Tizard Halls of Residence

plans currently under consideration
by College administration go ahead.
A l l overseas postgraduates are
guaranteed one year in hall. They are
placed in mixed halls, houses or

postgraduate hall at present. College

postgraduates having to move to new
Music news
The music room in 52/53 Princes
Gardens w i l l be available for
Thursday lunchtime concerts,
according to Professor David
Norburn, head of the School of
Management, but the room will not
be available for music societies to
practise in. The musical societies are
still involved in negotiations to find
an alternative venue and will be
presenting a petition of over five
hundred signatures to the College
authorities to outline the importance
of adequate music facilities.
their respective reports, the meeting
moved to the election of Union
officers.
The revised motion on the
censorship of publications was
quickly passed. Debate was begun on
an emergency motion to reduce soft
drinks prices in College and Union
bars when quorum was called and the
meeting was closed.

Services Officer, Alan Hepper as

Union Council Delegation and Rory
Curtis as Haldane Record Buyer.

rooms, interfere with their studies and
that a single postgraduate hall could
cut down administrative costs.
Beit Hall and Weeks Hall have also
been considered but College have
rejected Beit because of its 'lively
atmosphere' and Weeks because some
rooms are reserved for students
sponsored by Vickers, who helped
pay for the hall.
The exact location of the hall has
yet to be decided.
Kings anger
Students at K Q C College are claiming
that they are being forced to join their
graduate association while they are
still at college. Membership of the
Association, the K C L A , costs £5 and
during registration at the start of term
the college implied that membership
of the Association was compulsory.
The students' union are angry as
this goes directly against an
agreement which the college made
last year, they also point out that
students are not given their grant to
join a graduate association.
In a poll of 130 students, 75 % said
that they had been told membership
was compulsory, 50% had actually
paid to join, and % of these wanted
their money back.
A n edition of the K Q C college
newspaper has been referred to the
college solicitors as regards a possible
libel action, after they carried a
cartoon depicting students dressed as
sheep queueing at a K C L A desk with
a person reading a book titled 'Fraud
Made Easy'.
Extra cash
Universities are to get an extra £61m
next year, £60m in 1990 and 1991,
on top of £56m already announced to
cover the increase in academics pay.
M r Kenneth Baker, the Education
Secretary, claimed that this meant an
extra £131m for universities but the
Committee of Vice-Chancellors and
Principals believe that the new money
actually available will be only £10m
which would be swallowed up by an
inflation increase.
Collapse!
Residents in a Hamlet Gardens flat
had a rude awakening last Friday
when the ceiling of their shower
collapsed. The fall of plaster, in the
early morning, occurred despite the
fitting of a new shower unit and other
repairs carried out after the summer
vacation vandalism.
Stolen!

s
F E L I X has received a pseudo-ransom
demand for Arnie, a fibreglass
gnome, the I C U Rugby mascot.
Although the note mentioned no cash
demand, it is thought that Arnie will
be ransomed in connection with Rag.
Along with the note, F E L I X received
Arnie's identification badge and a
Jack of Spades card.
Arnie was kidnapped at Freshers'
Fair and IC Rugby Captain Andrew
Taylor received an anonymous phone
call about a week and a half later
confirming that Arnie had been
abducted and not merely mislaid.
M r Taylor said that 'we would like
him back, but we are not desperate'.
Other players feel that as Arnie is
battered and substantially limbless his
disappearance is no great loss.
