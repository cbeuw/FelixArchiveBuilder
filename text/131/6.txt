FELIX
S£/?/OUSLY SPEAKING
BY SIG
The writings of Sig are, to a
rather obvious extent baaed on such
material - emphasising ludicrous
connections and exaggerations, suoh as
one would expect to find in dreams.
This, of oourse, requires l i t t l e
talent, but oan provide both amuse-
ment and instruction far the partici-
pants. Amusement? because the human
mind i s not an entirely serious machine-
there is always a plaoe far that elusive
quality called 'humour' and which we
always consider everyone else has a
twisted sense of.
Far several weeks now, thi3
column has been a vehicle for some
rather curious a r t i c l e s - made up very
largely of psychologically "loaded"
material. This has been far a reason,
naturally, and Sig hopes that h i s
readers w i l l find i t of interest.
F i r s t of a l l , by way of introduction,
why should there have been any discus-
sion at a l l of the 'rubbish' (as some
have called i t ) that has appeared here?
Admittedly, i t was nonsense of a type.
In faot, nonsense does not exist -
everything has a reason and can be
connected with something else - "non-
sense" i s merely something that does not
appear to tie in with the accepted
l i n e s of thought or the customs of the
particular society that you l i v e in.
I f there i s no nonsense, i n the usually
accepted meaning of that word, what
then are we l e f t with? Consider
your dreams, for i t i s then that the
careful guard that you normally have
over your thoughts i3 no longer on
duty. How often do we a l l dream what
we are satisfied to c a l l "nonsense".
Yet i t i s this very material - without
connections, relations or any obvious
reference to our spatial lives which
i s constantly i n the process of being
moulded i n our unconscious.
Was the writing of Sig necessary
or important? The answer to that
is neither "Yes" nor "No". Because
they have been written directly, with-
out the interference of thought and
analysis, Sig' s soribblings' have
appealed mainly to people who feel
rather than think: such people are
neither better nor worse than anyone
else, they are just different. It so
happens (otherwise he could not have
written them) that Sig believes in the
"engagement" theory of human existence
which means that we are in instantaneous
contact with the outside world. What
we each make of, and with, this world
depends on the mental attitudes that
we each have, and have developed. It
is a medical faot that, barring mal-
formations, we all possess the same
physical basis to our mentality. What
differs between 'personalities' i s the
relative flexibility and nimbleness
of that delicate machine, the human
brain. This faot makes nonsense, i n
literal terms, of barriers, whether
social religious or otherwise.
This also means that for anyone to
claim a complete understanding of the
human spirit or the totality of human
wisdom, i s as ridiculous as to claim that
any one human language oan contain
anything but a fraction of the total of
human truth and beauty.
The Chinese have a proverb:
"The bullfrog rent its throat
trying to t e l l the eagle how to fly"
This i s a timely reminder to all who
would write and t e l l others what they

must do. But an excuse can be found
for a l l who would write, surely, far,
i f they can produce one new thought
during t h e i r lifetime, then a l l that
has been wasted i s only so by compari-
son? Human progress is not carried
forwards by one great individual, but
by a whole body of individuals. We
are a l l great i n some way, but i t
remains for us t o find out i n which
way our greatness l i e s . A l l wishful
thinking, you say?
As a f i n a l consideration of the
material that is poured down the long-
suffering throats of the "publio"
there i s that element of distortion
which i s so essential i n l i f e . With-
out distortions of different kinds,
there would be no art. An exaggeration
upon a point i n time and space, upon
an event and an emotion produce the
sonnet and the painting. The very
exercise of the selective faculty by
a human mind implies distortion of some
kind.
We are all right, we are a l l wrong-
because we- are human. We possess
emotions, which, because we are scien-
tists, we are not supposed to allow to
develop. In this case, we are all in
danger of becoming mere cabbages.
Because we are human, we have emotions.
This i s so much a matter of faot that
to be ashamed of i t , or to try to
pretent otherwise i s ludicrous and
doomed in the and to failure. To
those that think and Feel, Sig would
like to try and explain how other
people think and look at the world
around him. But remember, because
you look at the world i n one way, and
the rest of Society i n another, i t does
not necessarily mean that you are
wrong. Ibsen's famous play "Pillars
of Society" ends with the line "The
strongest man in the world, i s he who
stands aost alone".
