SOCCÂ£P COP
E a r l i e r i n the afternoon the two
teams had trotted out onto the pitch to
a great roar of welcome from the large
crowd of supporters, i n which I.C.
students far outnumbered Kings. The
two sides lined up along the centre
l i n e to be presented to Professor S i r
David Hughes-Parry, >C. ,M.A. ,L1.D.,
D.C.L., Director of the Institute of
Advanced Legal Studies and Chairman
of the University .AlJiletiO: Ground
Committee, and after the National
Anthem the game began i n almost ideal
conditions.
The experienced I.C. eleven,
containing ten players who have
appeared f o r University teams, settled
down much more quickly tha.:, their
opponents, and caused the Kings defence
much trouble by feeding their extremely
dangerous wingers with a stream of long
passes. However, the goals did not
come and gradually Kings were allowed
to come more and more into the game,
but were unfile to burst through the
s o l i d 1.0. defencej. On one occasion
a goal was only pi-evented by Dytham
kicking o f f the l i n e .
After the i n t e r v a l , I.C. r e a l l y
began to get on top with both wingers
being continually set i n action by their
team mates, and only a great display
by the Kings goalkeeper prevented a
score before Pritchard performed his
great deed. This gave the team a
tremendous boos*', and from then on
Kings were subjected to continuous
pressure, which was encouraged by a
powerful roar of "I.C.,I.C.,I.C.,"
from the touchline. The second
goal came when Coups forced the b a l l
home and the same player began the move
for the tl l i r d by breaking away down the
r i g h t jwing. "His centre was met by
Crawley whose shot was only p a r t i a l l y
3aved and Casemore was on the spot
to complete the scoring. On several
other occasions the forwards very
nearly added to the score, and once
Coups h i t a weak goal-kick with a
tremendous f i r s t time shot which pro-
duced a magnificent save from the
keeper.
After the f i n a l whistle I.C.
skipper, Dai Joyce, his ambition now
achieved, triumphantly led his team up
i n t o the stand to be presented with the
Cup. Every member of the team had
played his heart out i n this great
performance, and had so worthily earned
the medals they received from Prof. S i r
David Hughes-Parry. F i n a l l y the team
l i f t e d their skipper aloft with the Cup,
and carried him into the changing rooms
to the acccrrrpaniment of the cheers of
the I.G. Supporting contingent, to a l l
of whom the club would l i k e to extend
i t s thanks for their encouragement.
Then while the crowd dispersed to the
bar or back to I.C. by coach, t r a i n ,
or on the two mascots "BO" and "JEZ",
the team celebrated their success by
drinking from the Cup. Later the
team returned with the Cup to I.C.
where i t i s hoped that i t w i l l remain
for many years, i n company with the
rugby Cup for which I.C. play Kings
i n a fortnights time.
R E C T O R S
CUP
MINES
This year, for the f i r s t time, the
entry was limited to two boxers i n each
weight from each College. This natur-
a l l y l e d to the cream of the talent
being brought forward and a more balanced
programme.
A olose contest was forecast from
the start and the evening l i v e d up t o
i t s expections. Minesraen were
resplendent i n dinner-jackets and cigars
and the Guildsmen (probably saving
their dress shirts far the Engineer's
B a l l thd next evening) were more
modestly dressed. (Two prominent
Guildsmen appeared i n cloth caps and
mufflersj). The entire audience was
enthusiastic and very alive to the
sport inside the r i n g and outside too.
Vocal and musioal (trumpets and
bugles) support was much i n evidence.
U n t i l the very end the soores were
absolutely level. Before the f i n a l s
were boxed only one point separated
the three Colleges. The eventual
result put Mines and Guilds (who won
l a s t year) even with 43 points each,
and RCS a shade behind with 39 points.
This does not give an indication of
the quality of the individual bouts,
some of which ware very close indeed.
Several dark horses~were brought
to l i g h t and this augers well f o r the
I.C. team next year. The standard of
boxing was due to the efforts of the
team captains and the I.C. trainer.
Another innovation
was the award of a cup
for the best loser which
was very kindly presented
by the Club's President ,
O.C. Seaford Esq. I t
was won by J . F a i r f i e l d
of Mines. Another Min-
esman P. Mousset-Jones
was voted the best sty-
l i s t i n the competition.
It i s very d i f f i c u l t
to pick the best bouts of
the evening. The mem-
orable highlights were:
a few rousing battles;
Wronski vs. Bridges, Tine
vs. Ebsworth, Owen vs.
Cox, M i l l e r vs. Lance;
also the stylised f i s t s
of Mousset-Jones and the
cool efficiency of Yorke
and Faulkner. Many o f
the losers too ought t o
be congratulated upon the
plucky display they pro-
vided.
TIE WITH
GUILDS
The individual Champions were:
Flyweight P. Sribhibhadh
Bantamweight H. Kirpalani
Feather weight A. Cox
Lightweight D.Young
Light welterweight... G. Yorke
Welterweight L.Williams
Light middleweight. T.Banks
Middleweight. P.Mousset-Jones
Light heavyweight P.Vine
Heavyweight C.Wronski
In conclusion the Club would l i k e
to thank the gentlemen of the L.A.B.A.
for the hard work they did i n judging
and refereeing the bouts. We should
l i k e to thank Dr. Weale f o r giving
away the prizes. John Bramley waa a
masterful compere and h i s handling o f
the audience a display of pluok and
science i n i t s e l f . Also the seconds
who worked i n the two corners f o r so
long and with such efficiency. Those
who helped to organise the evening can
find no words sufficient to thank Mr.
Henry for the splendid job he d i d i n
organising the o f f i c i a l s and boxers.
And t o those who came to watch our
thanks for making i t a successful
evening.
SWIMMING
Last Saturday the I.C. swimming
and water polo teams went down to B r i s t o l
for a match with B r i s t o l University.
Unfortunately B r i s t o l oould only f i e l d
one man i n each event so we put two
single-string teams i n the swimming
events. The result was a win f a r the
I.C. f i r s t strings with 23 points t o
Bristols 15 points and I.C. second
strings 10 points. Since there were
only nine I.C. men t h i s was a particu-
l a r l y fine effort and demonstrates the
v e r s a t i l i t y of the team. Two fine
lengths by Maomillan being the high-
l i g h t of the
The water polo match was won by
six goals to one, hat-tricks to Barham
and Jones giving us the necessary score.
I.C.'s team had only four f i r s t team
players i n the water.
The f i r s t team wan a league
match against Q.M.C. l a s t Tuesday by
9 goals to 2i Both teams were lacking
two of their men because of the U.L.
team's tour of Germany, but due t o our
greater reserve of players we beat the
league leaders; t h i s was their f i r s t
defeat t h i s season.
