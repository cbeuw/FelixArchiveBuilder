The most important event during the
past fortnight was the S.W.E.T.C.
Trophy Raoe on 11th Feb. This race is
a London Colleges Championship, run
over a 4 i mile course, partly i n
Epping Forest and partly on roads.
I.C. entered three teams and these
finished l3t, 4th and ljth. The winning
of this Trophy was a fine performanoe,
as U.C. had held i t for 4 years. We
also provided the individual winner
in John Collins, who finished 30
sees, ahead of Mitchell (U.C.) and Mead
(Q.M.C.). The I.C. team was completed
by Cleator (4th), Jaeger (6th), Briggs
(9th) and Brown (15th); M. Barber,
running for the second team, came 7th,
so that I.C. actually had 5 men i n the
first nine positions.
The following Saturday, on our
home course, our first team defeated
the Metropolitan Polioe, and our second
team lost to Brentwood School but
managed to beat Old Brentwoodians.
The outstanding performances in this
match were those of 0. Gilbert and M.
Barber, who finished 2nd and 3rd.
On Feb. 18th, I.C. fielded two
'A' teams of equal strength, one to
run against Q.M.C., the other to run
against L.S.S. and King's. There
was thick fog on the Q
.
M
.
C
. course, and
due to their Captain getting lost and
taking three of our men with him, we
narrowly lost the race by 25 pts. to 30
(rather good tactics!t) The indiv-
idual winner was John Collins, who
finished 4 mins ahead of the next man.
Then oame James (4th), Sandoz (7th)
Smith (8th), and Huntley £l0th).
Our other team beat L.S.E., but
narrowly lost to King's 71, I.C. 76 and
L.S.E. 88. Our scoring men were Tilly
(6th), Warren (7th), Briggs (9th),
Rayment ( l l ) , Clare (12), Cheeney (14)
and Barker (17).
Last Saturday (21st Feb) the I.C.
first team lost to Aylesbury A.C., but
defeated Deptford Park A.C., while the
second team again defeated Pearl
Assurance. J. Cleator was first I.C.
man home (5th) in the excellent time of
28 rains 56 s. Ihe I.C. team also
comprised Bernard and Brown (equal
8th), Tilly (10), Gilbert ( l l ) , and
Warren (15). In the second team Rob
Cheeney improved his personal best time
by more than a minute.
HYDE PARK ROAD RELAY
Tomorrow, 28th Feb., i s the date
of the Eleventh Hyde Park Road Relay,
which will be started by Brian Hewaon
at 3 p.m. at the West end of Rotten Row.
The raoe i s larger than ever before,
as 64 teams have 30 far entered, so
that at least 384 athletes will be
competing. We believe thi3 is now
the largest Relay race in this country,
and probably in the world.
Favourites to win the Sir Roderick
H i l l Cup are Loughborough College, but
i t is impossible to forecast who will
take second place. This is tradition-
ally the position occupied by Imperial
College, but many other teams will
attempt to displace them. Durham the
new U.A.U. Champs should do well.

I.C. once again meet Kings in the
final of the U.L. Cup, having beaten W
y
<
5-0 in the semi-final on February 11th.
The game, played at Wye, was unexpec-
tedly long and hard fought, and i t
wasn't until the second ten minutes of
extra time that I.C. managed to score
to the great relief of the large number
of enthusiastic supporters.
In the first half the expected
superiority in the scrum did not
materialise, and play was very even,
with a slight advantage to Wye who had
the slope.
In the second half, although I.C.
seemed to be pressing harder, several
dangerous breaks were made by Wye's
competent backs, but no side managed
to score.
Twenty minutes extra time, hav-
ing been previously agreed upon i n
the event of a tie, was played. I.C.
managed to hold off Wye's last down-
h i l l challenge and in the second ten
minutes the I.C. backs showed their
true form when an outside break by
Tony Seed with the ball quickly along
the line put Paul Buet over the line
in the left hand corner. Dai Phillips
produced a magnificent kick to put I.C
5 points up. From that moment on-
wards the true I.C. superiority in the
scrum showed and for the last five
minutes 10t>£ possession of the ball
from the line out made the I.C.
victory certain.
Both the team and the now hoarse
I.C. supporters spent a very enjoyable
evening in Wye leaving the GEORGE at
10.30 under the watchful eyes of the
whole Wye police force.
Without the wonderful support
given to the team by the I.C.
spectators the result may well have
been different. We look forward to
seeing them at Motspur Park for the
final on Saturday, March 4th.
ICWSC
The only match played i n the last
fortnij^it was a squash match against
Kings. After having lost JaW at
the beginning of the term, I.C.W.S.C.
turned the tables to win convincingly
by 4 matches to one. Of the 8 matches
played against the 1st teams from
other colleges this season I.C.W.C.
have won 5, a very good second.

ATTENTION OF ALL PEOPLE INTENDING TO
PLAY CRICKET THIS YEAR is drawn to not-
ices posted on the Cricket Club notice
board (which adjoins the Bar), giving
full details of the Club's activities
and arrangements for trials.
The I.C. team will be chosen from
the following:-
J. Collins, M. Barber, A. Larkum,
J. Cleator, J.F. Jaeger, 0. Gilbert
and D. Briggs.
Help is needed with the work
irvolved in running this race, and with
the Crosscountry Club Dance in the
Union in the evening. YoIu«iccrc
should apply to Dave Briggs (Relay
Organiser) or to G.P. T i l l y (C.C. Cap-
tain).
On the following Saturday the
1st XV played O.M.T. 'A' in a mood
of anticlimax and won 12-0 after a
rather disappointing game. Last
Saturday they lost their 3rd game
of the season, 6-9, rather surpris-
ingly to a good R.A.F. Farnboro'
side, the 2nd XV winang 32-0.
The "Bards", fresh from their con-
vincing win over the Kerchsjit Taylors,
crushed a powerful Harrow XV at Harling-
ton last Saturday. The forwards dom-
inated a rugged pack battle and, with
excellent service from the base of the
scrum, the free scoring backs, combining
aggression with a rock-solid defence,
contained the opposition within their
own 25 for the major part of the game.
The team, well led as U3ual from
the pack by Dave Titley and inspired by
the re- appearance of ex-captain B i l l
Shakespeare (The Bard), showed a con-
summate skill which bodes well for their
future match against the 'B' XV on the
morning of the Cup match, March 14th.
The result: The Bards 23 pts
Harrow 0 pts
Scored: Jim (2), Jack, B i l l Big
Bike, Terry, Ginger,
Slim Jim (1 conversion)
Missed: Rush ( 4 conversions!)

The fortunes of the Hockey Club
have unfortunately taken a turn for the
worse. The 1 st XI after losing only
one match last term, have won only three
of their eight matches this term. Our
defeat in the semi-final of the U.L. Gup
by U.G. ( 4 - 0 ) was a bitter disappo-
intment. The margin of the defeat was
somewhat harsh, as two goals were scored
after we had lost full-bick Macrae*
through injury. "
,
'
e did r.ot take early
opportunities and were defeated by the
better team (on the day).
Injuries and illness are two of the
reasons far the toss of form. Another
may be summed up in the phrase "nothing
succeeds like success". Last term we
were riding on the crest of a wave; w*
had beaten Battersea in the cup end
were going from win to win, This
term started with frustrating canceH
ations broken only by defeat on a
frozen pitch. There is s t i l l time to
break out of this vicious circle, and
end the season on a winning note.
Now, as you probably a l l know, Jim
Carter, our vociferous and ebullient
goalkeeper, is enlivening a hospital
ward with a broken ankle. ?fe wish you
a speedy recovery Jim.
