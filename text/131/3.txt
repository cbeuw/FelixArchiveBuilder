RCS. UNION
MEETING
H A L L S O F R E S I D E N C E
An R.C.S. Onion meeting was held
on Tuesday, 10th February, the main
part of the proceedings being devoted
to debate on Constituent College Hostels.
Mr. Butters, Prepo&ing-, said that
I.C. i s what i t i s just because of the
existence of the constituent colleges;
mixed halls of residence would extermin-
ate the constituent colleges. The
Old Student Associations have roots i n
the college system and i t i s d i f f i c u l t
to see how they would continue. The
system produces four different admin-
i s t r a t i v e bodies giving p o s s i b i l i t y t o
a f a r greater number o f people taking
part, and raise the I.C. President above
petty or small l o y a l t i e s .
Mr. Finch, i n opposing the motion,
suggested that R.C.S. should mix with
Guilds i n order t o turn them into
decent citizens. Even the Rector could
see this argument and the Rector had
not been an o f f i c i a l of the R.C.S. Onion.
On a more serious l e v e l tMr. Finch sug-
gested technical d i f f i c u l t i e s i n s p l i t -
ting up between three colleges seven
h a l l s of residence to be b u i l t within
a period of f i f t e e n years.
Mr. Emerson, seconding the motion,
said that as we have no Arts here but
have a broad range of character i n each
college, we shouid have college hostels
as competition encourages resource and
self-reliance; I.C. would therefore,
thrive. I n the hostels as planned
i t would be the aim of each Warden
to get hostel l o y a l t i e s and eventually
Presidents of H a l l would appear4 to
the detriment of I.C.
Mr. Royee pointed out that
constituent collage hostels would
lead to ragging, broken furniture
and obscene drawing, enough to turn
the Rector into a sleepless Knight.
Mr. P f e f f e r from the floor
waffled around the proposition and
opposition and advised the Onion t o
abstain. I t had been stated by the
Rector that there would be no i n t e r -
hostel sport and inmates would *S
distributed by ballot thus no hostel
loyalty would be created.
Apart from a few red herrings
l i k e Imperial Oniversity and the
Cambridge system no new matter was
brought up from the floor. However
concern was expressed for the exis-
tence of I.C. and the constituent
colleges.
The motion wa3 lost by 46 votes
to 55 with 25 abstentions.

Oleo-palias Meedle
Imperial College, the College
of men, i s imprinted on the minds of
students of London University. On
being t o l d that there are a few women
students, 88 i n a l l , they immediately
imagine the "blue stocking" and " j o l l y
hookey stiok" type, attempting t o
compete with the men on and off the
field.
This impression i s also held by
the majority of students at I.C. The
women belong t o an Association whose
members are considered to be unapproach-
able, scheming, unattractive females.
In faot, they're I.C.W.A. I.C.W.A.
Keep outj This cry of former years i s
now almost an echo along the third
floor corridor of the hostel.
Perhaps i t i 3 due t o the increase i n
numbers which both sexes have welcomed
We have r e a l i s e d that the mens a t t i t -
ude has changed and they are slowly
recognising the tremendous support we give
to the College. (This i s not a
column of appraisal but a plea t o
the few students who s t i l l condemn the
women at I.C.)
In return members of the Union
have rendered many services t o I.C.W.A.,
who wish to recognise these servioes i n
the election of Mr. I.C.W.A. Many
nominations have been received but
how many of these are serious and
appropriate w i l l be discovered at the
next General Meeting o f I.C.W.A., to be
held early i n March. My personal
choice i s the Production Manager of this
publication, affectionately known as
Tub. This l i t t l e man has a
unique way with women and has caused
much heart ache among the women a t
I.C. He i s also a great sportsman,
renowned i n the climbing of mountains
and scaffolding leading to young
ladies windows.
