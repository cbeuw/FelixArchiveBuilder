GENERAL STUDIES
SHEER POETRY
Poetry "began as a branch of magic
the "basis of the rhythmic implications
through which roan could describe l i f e
to himself, h i s means of exploring for
knowledge by imitating nature. This
imitation continued i n England up to
the Augustan period, said Cecil Day
Lewis i n hi3 lecture on "The Poet i n
Theory", as a form of moral improve-
ment, picturing virtue i n words and
educating by example.
The poet i s a spokesman of the
community, i n so f a r as he i s influenced
by society: h i s poetry i s inseparable
from propaganda f o r building up morale,
in the same way as the a r t i s t ' s paintings
i n the Middle Ages followed Christianity.
Further, this recording and praising of
l i f e is f o r giving us pleasure at the
same tine.
Poetry has now become a recreation,
where the poet explores l i f e to further
his own personal understanding: he i s
not primarily concerned with corarrrunica-
t i n $ anything, and i s oblivious of his
future audience. In the past, copying
had no shame attached to i t , but now
o r i g i n a l i t y i s at a premium, and Mr.
Lewis believes that f r i c t i o n between
the poet and society w i l l produce the
best effects.
But, theorising apart, poetry i s
to give pleasure: ancient man used
r e f r a i n and repetition to remove e v i l
s p i r i t s - this was the earliest dem-
onstration of man*s desire f o r form
and order in the hitherto untethered
diversity of l i f e . Tod -y, "the
fertilisation of the soul i s the reason
for the necessity of art:" i t ijMreeses
our understanding of life by giving us
k knowledge unobtainable elsewhere, and
i s the only means of s t a b i l i s i n g the
fleeting moment and emphasising i t .
Since words are used for so many
purposes other than poetry, poetic
language, the source of whioh was the
religious incantation, has been i n t r o -
duced, although this also brings the
danger of a l o t of t a l k without any
meaning. Nevertheless, poetry i s great
by virtue of i t s language rather than
pure o r i g i n a l i t y , and any Torce i s der-
ived solely from the i n t r i n s i c virtue
of the lines themselves.
ICWA WINS THE TOSS
Twelve o'clock on Shrove Tuesday
found the Chairman of Entertainments
supervising the preparation of the
"batons" for the annual men . I.C.W.A.
Pancake Race. Being an engineer he
directed the mixing and cooking of the
pancakes with s t r i c t adherence to
B r i t i s h Standards.
I.C.W.A. were sporting a strong
team, mostly members of the victorious
I.C.W.S.C. team which went to Delft.
The men's team included our beloved
Warden (see photo.), Dr. Kenneth
Wooley (see Sennet) alias Ken Weal,
and a remarkably agile President.
The men, fortunately bleseed with
a rather tough B r i t i s h Standard panoakej
lost much ground due to excessive back-
bending, and i n the l a s t leg, Tony
^Tub) Iwart was necking and necking
with Hilary Torapsett, but, with 50
yards and two tosses to go he dropped
the pancake. There was much weeping
and gnashing of teeth among the
assembled throng. Thus I.C.W.A.
won the contest, and gained the
ooveted Shrove Tuesday frying pan.
E N G I N E E R ' S B A L L
Last Friday, City and Guilds College
presented their annual Engineer's Dinner
and Dance. The Dinner, held i n the
Lower Dining Hall and the Upper Refect-
ory, was indeed a welcome change from
heme cooking and the usual dismal prod-
uct of the Mooney cuisine. ' iest of
Honour was Professor Saunders, the Dean
of City and Guilds, who proposed the
toast of the college, to which the Pres-
ident Dave Cxark responded. Mike New-
son got up to speak and launched into
a long series of Engineering jokes, and
i t was not u n t i l long after that j * was
found that he was welcoming the Guests.
Ruby Rubenstein, an Old Centralian, re-
sponded , and closed the o f f i c i a l pro-
ceedings.
The exceedingly replete assembly
migrated to the Concert Hall, and i t
was not u n t i l much later, when the effect
of the meal wore off, that the term
"danoing " could be applied to their
circumambulation. The band may have
been lacking i n n\unerical strength, but
their sheer stamina was prodigious, as
was more than adequately displayed i n
their marathon Cha-cha-chas. The
evening was characterised by a real
sense of friendliness, so often lacking
on formal occasions such as these. The
evening, or rather, the morning as i t
then was, closed with the traditional
Boomalaka.

Forty-nine oompetitiors aet oat
from the Start of the C. * G. Meter
dub's Loon-Goon Night Rally last Feb.
6th. Although the weather was crisp
and clear to begin with, the route soon
ran into thick fog whioh began to take
its toll of competitors by one means
or another. With visibility down to
20 f t . and less, and a tight time
schedule to keep to many oars had dam-
aging encounters with parts of the
scenery. 'lie stories naturally beoaaw
all the better for the telling, but
briefly the oaaualty l i s t was as
follows:
An Austin 7 over-looked a left
header, rolled onto its roof, and then
somersaulted back onto i t s wheels.
It was driven home.
A Biley Special stoved i t s front
in on a bank when the driver lost the
road in the fog at a T-juntion, and
went straight on.
A Marri3 Minor van couldn't
leaide whioh branch of a fork to
take so the driver ohose the middle
path. There was a house there.
A Ford Anglia grazed a bank and
bent a wing, whilst a Ford Taunus
bumped the curb and dislocated the
front suspension.
Mechanical failures put out another
Austin 7 and another Riley; whilst one
crew r e t i r e d with oarbon monoxide
poisoning.
In addition to a l l thi3 a marshal
lost two front teeth in a fight (with
a non-competitor) and even this was
after he had been in the ditch off a
motor-bike.
With the conditions as they were
it is not so surprising that only 19
out of the original 49 finished the
course. The winner was G.F. Howard
closely followed by M.J. Gibson, both
of whom were Guildsmen.
UNION MEETING
CONTINUED FROM FRONT PAGE
(2) That this Union considers that, i n
general, Wardens of College Halls
of Residence should be appointed
from the Academic Staff.
It was proposed by Peter Levin,
who said that through the medium of
Hostel l i f e , the students and Staff
exert a c i v i l i s i n g influence on one-
another. Fe pictured an hostel run by
one of the Admin, as a barracks; an
i n s t i t u t i o n with personnel devoted to
running student lif<_. He declared that
the Admin were " l i k e ruddy rabbits, or
rather worse as one rabbit by i t s e l f
is r e l a t i v e l y harmless."
When aaked whether the motion, i f
passed would carry any weight with the
Power.-thab-be, the President said that,
constitutionally, the matter was no
ooncern of the students. In general,
i t was f e l t that although not a l l of t
the Admin, would necessarily be bed, i t
was better t o adopt a safe policy by
choosing the Academic Staff. The
motion was carried with only three vot-
ing against.
