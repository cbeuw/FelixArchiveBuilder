NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT
Dear S i r ,
I t was obvious, from the v i o l e n t
reaction from the f l o o r at the Soper-
Curran debate on B r i t a i n ' s Nuclear
P o l i c y , that there are a large propor-
t i o n of I.C. students sympathetic t o
the cause of Nuclear Disarmament. I f
t h i s be the case, why on earth do they
continually f a i l to respond to the
challenge and not support a Nuclear
Disarmament Group at I.C.? Such a
Group has existed since l a s t March,and
yet the response t o a l e t t e r t o F e l i x
and a meeting l a s t May was negligible.
It i s true that the Nuclear
Disarmament Committee has been severely
r e s t r i c t e d i n i t s manoeuvres: the
establishment i s seldom enamoured to the
thought of spontaneity, obvious i n the
condition for the formation of a new
society. To have to pass a constitu-
tion through t o two s i t t i n g s of the
Social Clubs Committee which meets one
a term i s quite ludicrous. Furthermore,
to forbid the use of notice boards with-
out the conoession of a right-wing Union
Office i s quite clearly designed t o
k i l l a l l i n i t i a t i v e at b i r t h ; to
have to stand o f f the pavement to
distribute l e a f l e t s at I.C. i s wicked,
especially i n weather such as t h i s .
How much warmer and congenial are the
conditions inside the Union lounge?
Ih spite of the d i f f i c u l t i e s
enumerated above, i t i s s t i l l possible
for a Nuclear Disarmament Group t o
funotion e f f e c t i v e l y within the College.
A l l that i s required i s a nucleus of
some twenty or t h i r t y people who are
prepared to give a few hours a week.
Considering the time spent by the
average student sipping coffee or beer
this would amount to a very small
s a c r i f i c e .
In olosing I would sympathise with
with one of your correspondents S i r ,
who recently complained of the d i s -
appointment he feels about student l i f e
and attitude at I.C. I would add a
further complaint: lethargy. I
w i l l i n g l y salute my active opposition;
at least they have convictions. I
also acknowledge the devotion to duty
displayid by the majority of Union
o f f i c i a l s , to whom we are a l l indebted.
The i r r i t a n t i s the student who i s
unable to see beyond the p i n t , text
book or confines of h i s college or
home.
Yours sincerely,
David Finney
EDITOR'S NOTE
On points of information:-
a) The constitution of a new society
does not have t o pass through two
s i t t i n g s of the S.C.C. Onoe the
S.C.C. has passed i t and i t has
been approved by the Union Executive,
the society oan be formed.
b) The S.C.C. s i t s at least two or
three times per term, more frequent
meetings are unnecessary as there
i s insuffient business to merit
them.
e) The Nuclear Disarmament Committee
has"never applied f o r membership of
S.C.C.
MAC REPLIES
Dear S i r ,
Mr. Brookes' l e t t e r gives the
impression that he i s t o t a l l y unaware
of the position of the cartoonist when
presenting such issues as that dealt
with by my cartoon.
I think that i t i s reasonable t o
c l a s s i f y t h i s cartoon as broadly
" p o l i t i c a l " - i n t h i s context " p o l i t i -
cal" denotes that i t dealt with
oonflioting opinions, not that the con-
troversy was of p o l i t i o a l origin.
In such circumstances i t i s not the
place of the cartoonist to state h i s
own opinion (which i s of no interest)
but to observe the widely-held views
of others and present them through
his particular medium i n a way that i s
(he hopes!) mainly humourous, yet with
a slight undercurrent of acerbity.
I had always considered that anon-
ymity was a privilege to be invoked
by any w r i t e r - or cartoonist - who
cared to do so, that i t could even be
a virtue. ( I have certainly never
heard the right to use a nom de plume
questioned except i n oases of black-
mail. ) Mr. Brookes, however, thinks
otherwise. More, he dictates that ^
should think otherwise, f o r h i s
parenthetic comment " i s he ashamed t o
reveal h i s identity?" i s not just an
exclamation requiring no reply, but
a challenge that he knows I cannot
refuse. Thus I must sign t h i s l e t t e r -
sorrowfully, becuase I know of one
person at least who w i l l be very d i s -
appointed (he confided i n me that
"Mao" was r e a l l y Mr. Garnett seeking
solace i n h i s old age by drawing!) -
but I shall continue to use my "nom
de cartoon". I t i s f o r the very
'great, and them only, t o write t h e i r
f u l l names on their doodles, and I am
certainly no Ronald Searle.
Yours, etc.

Due to the increasing numbers
of Freshers every year at Imperial
College there has "been for many years
a very evident need for the streamlining
of the Freshers1
receptions, which are
held by the I.C. Union immediately p r i o r
to the commencement of the academic
session i n October.
The main d i f f i c u l t y i n the past has
been the limited space and also the short
time available i n the afternoon. The
Freshers' Reception next year w i l l there-
fore occupy the complete day aid more
space w i l l be made available i n the
Union Building for the social and athr-
l e t i c clubs.
Previously Freshers were separated
according to whether or not they perm-
anently resided i n t..e v i c i n i t y of
London, but the di\. sion w i l l now be
made into undergraduates and postgrad-
uates.
This i s only a small step, long
overdue, but I sincerely hope that i t
w i l l be the f i r s t one leading to a
very much improved Reception.

NELSON S COLUMN
Members of the R.S.M. Union were amazed
to hear at t h e i r last Union "neeting,
that t h e i r Hon. Pornographer had been
locked i n the Hostel room of an ICWArian
of very high office. (She has made a
special request that her name should
not be mentioned i n this column again)
However, the Miners await t h e i r next
meeting with bated breath.
Nelson congratulates Cleopatra upon
hearing that Bedford College wish to
print her Wallulk Rating i n t h e i r news-
paper. However, he doubts the accuracy
of i t s interpretation, f i n d i n g that h i s
own i s + 20.
Congratulations also to Guilds cm organ-
i s i n g the best Carnival of recent years,
although one wonders whether the door-
handles were torn off the Concert H a l l
doors by those trying to gain entrance
or those trying to escape.
Whilst the competition f o r Mr I.C.W.A.
of 1959 has aroused a great deal of
amusement at I.C., Nelson would have
thought that the ladies of I.C.W.A.
were f a r more qualified than the men
to propose the nominees - well, Just
look who's been proposed!
No wonder the Miners made a come-back
in the Rector's Cup - half of them were
watching International, no-holds-barred
wrestling i n the Albert H a l l on the
previous enening.
The other Thursday afternoon Nelson ob-
served "Jezebel" almost obscured under
a swarm of female models being photo-
graphed i n Imperial Institute Road. In
an exclusive interview , however, Mr.
Peter Kassler B8c., A.R.C.S., .President
of the R.C.S.U., neither denied nor
confirmed the rumour that copies are to
be c i r c u l a t e d to 300 female i n s t i t u t i o n s
throughout the country i n order to
attract more g i r l s to R.C.S.
TOAST
Dear S i r ,
With reference to the oomment of
your reporter on the a c t i v i t i e s of
I.C.W.S.C., I would l i k e to point out
that although IC men are notoriously
discourteous, only a small proportion
of the "gentlemen" present at the H a l l
Dinner mentioned refused t o toast
"Victorious Women". I am sure that
l!hey,like myself, modified the toast
to "Victorious ICWSC".
I am S i r , yours etc.,
