IMPERIAL COLLEGE
LditoHiat Comment
A well-known, and vocal. Union
Officer remarked "Well, that sort
of thing couldn't happen here, you
know". He was referring, in fact, to
the situation reported in 'Sennet'
as being in force at Battersea.
This was (at the time), that the Presi-
dent had resigned, and after some
reported machinations, the Principal
had taken over the Union.
The bright remark heading this c o l -
urn i s typical of the complacency which,
magnified a l i t t l e , permits revolutions
to happen, allow a Dachau to be b u i l t
unquestioned and so forth. That i t i s
unlikely to happen i n Imperial College
is true, but that does not rule out
the p o s s i b i l i t y .
If, f o r example, some prominent
(or stentorian) member of the student
body was to be publicly rude to some
High Personage and this Persona/re was
to take such remarks to heart and -
having some power over the Union -
decide that this Union were unfit to
elect i t s officers " i f that's the way
they are going to behave..." Very
soon, of course, he would dictate who
was to hold which post, and so on.
Such o take-over need not be
sudden, but could be so gentle that
few would even notice.
This i s a far-fetched, of course,
but who doubts that an oak can grow
from an acorn?

Not a l l human emotions are happy

frustrating circumstances i n real l i f e ,

A MEMORY OF TWO MONDAYS, by Arthur
M i l l e r , the American playwright, t o
be presented on Granada T.V. at 9 p.m.
this evening. I t has been described
by the author as a "pathetic coraedy",
and t e l l s of a boy who works among peo-
ple f o r a couple of years, sharing i n
their troubles, their hope3 and successes:
and when the time comes to depart, they
barely notice i t . He i s l e f t to endure
alone the absence of hope of a l l that
he had lived for.
Several theatres outside the
West End have plays prior or subs-
equent to their main London production
and these may provide excellent enter-
tainment with less travelling: f o r
example, this week at the Streatham
H i l l Theatre i s EXPHESSO BONGO, the
l i v e l y musical set i n a coffee bar,
which ran for nine months at the
S e v i l l e Theatre. Then, at the
Wimbledon Theatre i s Arthur M i l l e r ' s
A VIE' FROM THE BRIDGE, which has
now escaped from- the Theatre Clubs,
Also in South London, at the
Richmond Theatre this week, i s
Robert Anderson's TEA .vND SYMPATHY
while at the Theatre Royal, Stratford,
E., is a new play FINGS AIN'T WOT
THEY USED T'BE t e l l i n g of Fred
Ji 6 watth knowing.
Cochran's attempts to run a dilapidated
dive, constantly v i s i t e d by the police
u n t i l he i s ousted by a smart new boy
with a r i v a l establishment.
As to new films, apart from LA
GRANDE ILLUSION at the Academy Cinema
(mentioned i n the l a s t issue), there
i s DANGER WITHIN at the Odeon, Leicester
Square, starring Richard Todd, Richard
Attehborough, Michael Wilding and
Donald Houston. This i s another war
story set i n a prison camp, but f o r
some reason, which i s not very apparent
there is one man who does not want the
others to escape: however, f o r a f i l m
on this theme to receive good Press
reports, as this one has, i t must have
something to raise i t above the milieu.
Turning to exhibitions, on u n t i l
next Friday at the Building Centre,
Store Street, i s LE CORBUSIER Exhibition
celebrating the seventieth birthday of
this versatile exponent of architecture,
T>ainting, sculpture and tapestries.
Also at the same place i s a permanent
but changing exhibition of buildings
and their equipment.
Then, u n t i l the end of next week
there i s an exhibition at Selfridges
of "Leather Furniture on Parade", to
reawaken any interest i n the p o s s i b i l -
i t i e s of a material which has l o s t
much of i t s popularity since the war.
L I T . & D E E
The 12th February wa3 an important
day for the Debating Society when Dr.
Donald Soper and Mr. Charles Curran
came to college to debate the motion:
"That the Government's Nuclear Policy
is Inconsequent".
The Chairman, Dr. Allan, said that
he had some doubts on the meaning of the
ward "inconsequent", but took the
motion to mean that some people were
in favour of the govt's policy while
others were against i t . Accordingly,
he invited Dr. Soper to speak against
it.
"It is wrong for Christian count-
ries to attempt to carry a cross in one
hand and a nuclear weapon in the other",
said Dr. Soper. He was also opposed
to the policy on practical grounds:
"It is reokless to muck about with
cosmio forces which are not fully under-
stood.
"
W
h
o
m the gods destroy they first
make mad", he said and carried on to
condemn "silly men like Selwyn Lloyd
and Dulles. Tt was wrong for Dulles
to say he would go to war". He quoted
Lord Birdwood who had said that he would
rather die than live under Communist
tyranny, and asked i f Lard Birdwood
would be willing far millions of other
people to die because of his personal
views. Dr. Soper advocated an inter-
national solution to the problem, as
he thought national barriers to be no
longer opposite.
Mr. Curran disliked Dr. Soper's
presentation of the argument, saying
that-
i t was not a choice between lunatics
on one side and intelligent people on
the other. Both Labour and Conservat-
ive governments had pursued the policy
of the nuclear deterrent. He pointed
out that there was a Labour government
when the first A-bomb was dropped, and
that i t was the decisions of a Labour
government to manufacture H-bombs and
allow American air bases i n this coun-
try. He quoted Earl Attlee: "I
supported making the bomb, because i t
was the only policy whioh has kept the
Red Army where i t i s " . If Donald
Soper thought Christianity was opposed
to farce, then said Mr. Curran, he
should start by converting the Arch-
bishops of Canterbury and go on to the
Vatican. As he did not agree with
capitulation to the Soviet threat, and
as nuclear knowledge could not be
eradicated, he thought the only solution
was one to be brought about by politi-
cal discussion.
Floor speeches were noticeably
lacking in opposition to the motion.
The theme of a number of speakers was
that money spent on defence would be
better used in the economic war for
the support of the underdeveloped coun-
tries. Some people felt the Russians
were ignorant. A number of non-
politicians present thought the problem
was a l l the fault of the "blasted
politicians".
Summing up. Dr. Soper said he did not
think the Russians were waiting far
war, and therefore he was in favour of
abandoning the cold war.
Mr. Curran thought that Communism
was s t i l l a treat and that what was
wanted was a bargain. "But," he said,
" i t takes two to make a bargain", and
the Russians always stuck at the idea
of foreign observers.
The Chairman declared the "ayes"
to have i t , after a show of hands, but
the House was obviously quite evenly
divided.
