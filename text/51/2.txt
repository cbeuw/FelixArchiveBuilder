J E F F K E N Y O N .
A rare picture of the Best
Dressed Man in I.C. seen with-
out a tie.
Born in 1928 at Darwen, tne youngest of a family of
five Jeff, decided to prove that though last he would he by
no means least.
Known for his neat appearance - called The Squire or
The Gentleman Miner - never being seen with a hair out of
place i t i s said he even carries a comb in his pyjamasiand
that his electric raior i s always in his pocket.
Smooth though his appearance is, with his powers of
concentration and willingness to turn his hand to anything,
he has made a success of almos everything he has done.
Not least i s this shown in the Sporting world, his successes
at school - Wrekin College, Wellington - where he played i n
the first team of every ball game, captaining Cricket,
Squash and Fives are shadowed by his career at I.C.
Entering the Mines in 1946 he has a B.Sc.. (Mining) and
a B.So. (Mining Geology) and i s at the moment studying f o r
a Ph.D. Whilst here he has represented the University at
Rugger and Squash (Purple), I.C. at Tennis, Squash, Cricket,
R.S.M. at Hockey, Soccer etc. Winning the Individual Squash
Championship for 6 years in succession, Jeff, also won the
Tennis Championship the first year he entered and this year
he has won the Shove-Half-Penny Competition also reaching
the final of the Darts Tournament. In 1948 he claimed to
have won tha Golf Championship finishing in two strokes less
than the winner though he tore his card up in disgust at the
ninth hole.
Outside College he has played for the East Lancashire
Club at Cricket, his favourite and best sport, representing
the Lancashire League on Tour together with such notables
as Constantine, Pope and Jim Smith of England and Middlesex
fame.
Jeff's talents are not confined to the Sporting field •
his mime of Gigli singing "The Barber of Seville" at the
President's Ball in 1952 will long be remembered together
with his Sand dance at this years Mines Carnival.
A staunch supporter of Lancashire he follows closely
the fortunes of the Duchy - his dialect stories being known
to many.
Being a Mining Engineer Jeff, has large interests abroad
and at the moment these are centred in South Africa.
If Jeff, teaves college this year his friendliness,
companionship and good nature will be missed by many people,

Students
The Nevada Students' Union has oomplained to
President Eisenhower about the frequent d i s t u r -
bances caused by A-homb explosions on the Yucca
F l a t s . A t h l 9 t e s have complained that s e v e r a l
f a l s e s t a r t s i n races occur due to confusion
between the sound of the t a c t i c a l A-bomb and the
sound of a s t a r t i n g gun. Anglers and l o v e r s
complain that v i c t i m s on the p o i n t of being hooked
are soared away, never to r e t u r n again. Other
complaints are a l s o coming i n . The Union
requests that explosions should be arranged only

The d i s t r e s s i n g side to t h i s business i s the
way i t i s i n c r e a s i n g , and i t increases by appeal-
ing to the basest i n s t i n c t i n man - h i s damned
l a z i n e s s . Our f a c t o r y - f r e s h food products,
d i s s o l v e i n s t a n t l y , spread smoothly, are lump-free,
scum-free, require no b o i l i n g , s t r a i n i n g , overnight
standing. I f we are to follow our cousins (or

A t l a n t i c , we s h a l l soon have our ( s p e c i a l l y

And so ad. i n f .
But we t r a d i t i o n a l i s t s (I assume you are a l l
w i t h me) can f i n d some hope f o r the f u t u r e . That «
these Blenders and Fresh-Packers have a deeply
ingrained i n f e r i o r i t y complex i s obvious. What do
they c o n t i n u a l l y harp on i n t h e i r e n t r e a t i e s ?
F i r s t l y t h e i r products are t e r r i b l y easy to use and
secondly they c o n t a i n a c c u r a t e l y known q u a n t i t i e s
of the most amazing components. These are u s u a l l y
given us i n a formula (hence my t i t l e ) giving-
"condensed f u l l - c r e a m milk s o l i d s k%, hydrolyzed

Our products do not need t h i s sort o f t h i n g . Real
