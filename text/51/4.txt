L E T T E R S T O T H E E D I T O R
Dmt S i r ,
I wish to draw tha attention of thm mmheta of I.G.Unim
to tha grossly u n f a i r and altogether I n s u l t i n g way i n which
the «lasti<ais «P the I.G.Jresidont i s being c a r r i e d out t h i s
j w .
I should explain that I am the proposer of W.F. (Welly)
tan, for tha pout mentioned and I s h a l l say at the outset
that I tmvw vary good reascsss f o r doing so. Wally has been
i n anooeaalva year* Secretary and Chairman of the I.C.
A t h l e t i o Clubs 0\ i t t e e , i s t h i s year's Secretary of the
Enico, and i s Secretary of TJ.L.Seoo«r Club. A l s o , he was
Hon.Secretary I.C.A.F.C. 1950-51, on the Hostel Residents
Committee from 1951^-52 and 1952-53, and Deputy Chairman
U.L.A.C. 1952-53. H© has had, therefor®, ample experience
of Union a f f a i r s - why then the unpleasantness of the
pant few days? I s h a l l enumerate the reasons which I have
been given and sy answers, ( l ) Although tha majority of
hia opponents l i k e hist personally, they do not think that
he would make a good president - t h i s i s not a concrete
reason, i t i s only a matter of opinion and mine d i f f e r s .
(2) Be spends too much time doing U.L.Soccer Club business
- I as a Eugby Club man and an s u f f i c i e n t l y broad minded to
admit that Soccer i s a l s o a good gao» and worthy of very
active support. (3) His e l i g i b i l i t y to stand whan nomin-
ated - t a l l y was, on the 11th June, a f u l l member of I.C.
Union and therefore e l i g i b l e . There has been a l o t of
a^wValtngint also which, by i t s very nature, i s not worth
repeating. I t i s my opinion, however, that Wally i s un-
popular i n certain o i r c l e s because he i s not the type to
say "yes" just because everybody else does.
Having, to my mind, amply j u s t i f i e d my proposal, I
• h a l l outline the very questionable "goings oa" i n what,
i n my opinion can only he described as the "Anybody feat
Wally f o r President" campaign. The e l e c t o r ! * ! notion
**» put up a f u l l sixteen days before the U t h Juo*, m&
i t had typed on i t that the noH&n&tien l i s t would clows
at 5 p.m, on that day. However,the Lords of the Union
had no "pet" Candidato en the c r u c i a l day so, although
Wally -mm f u l l y proposed and seconded, they altered, f a n "
olealng date to Tuesday, 16th June, ( I put i t to y«a that
there can be no other reason f o r doing t h i s ) . StSa.
alteratiem was made just JKPTEK tha Union Annual General
Hsotiag (were the Powers that Be A f r a i d of awkward
e^Mtiena?) The reason given f o r t h i s action i s that
they have interpreted a vague passage i n I.C.U.Bye-Lawa
kh "not loss than 2 days' passage") to Man that
they were e n t i t l e d to do so. I put i t to you that i t
ww not a coincidence that the Lords discovered t h i s era
the 11th June a f t e r a l l , the notice had been up a f u l l lt>
fays! A seoond candidate has bean proposed a f u l l day
a f t e r the advertised closing date and I put on record a
•t*wtc objection to t h e i r interpretation of the passage
aeatloaod.
I t i s the habit of lawyers i n t h i s country to baao
t h e i r arguments on previous r a l i n g a i n similar oases -
I s h a l l do the same. F i r s t read C & C A r t i o l o a of
Constitution, page 6 "at least one woe*" passage. I n
e f f a o t , both references I have mado swan that the
newineo afea.ll he proposed and f u l l y sooonded at l e a s t
a certain time before the e l e c t i o n . Now l e t me r e -
f r e s h your minds, or t e l l yon about the Guilds elections
ef only a year ago. The nomination l i s t was due to
oloho at 5 p.m. on & F r i d a y f o r elections a weok hence
l a t h i s case also, the Lords were unable to got a
"satisfactory" candidate to stand IN TIME - but the l i s t
olooed. Being of an i n q u i s i t i v e nature, I asked a Lord
whs.* tha p o s i t i o n was m& h i s answer was quits d e f i n i t e -
there was, according to the Constitution, NO CASE AT ALL
f a r putting up a candidate a f t e r the closing t i n t on the
closing day. An i n t e r e s t i n g point, here, i s that the l i s t
was closed when one candidate was not f u l l y seconded -
his second sooondsr a r r i v e d a few minutes a f t e r 5 p.m. At
the Union Meeting at which the elections were held, the
progoJMra of the other two candidates were ASKED i f they
had any objection to the other "irregular* nomination,
and, f i n a l l y , the Union ambers wero iwiked to accept the
excuse of the second seconder that he arrived l a t a dua to
transport trouble or something. Front the oaso quoted
above I can only conclude that the a l t e r a t i o n of the
closing time of t h i s year's I.C.election i s out of order
and that the l i s t d i d actually olese at 5 p.m. on June 11th,
I consider that the whole "date a l t e r i n g " business i s
a questionable "frame up" which i s not l e g s ! w i t h i n our
Union Constitution, and a thing to be deplored by a l l tha
Union nessbera - whether f o r Wally or not. A point whioh I
f e e l more strongly about, however, i s that the whole sordid
business amounta to nothing l e s s than a public i n s u l t to
Wally f o r no b e t t e r reasons than "matters of opinion" - a
tM.Bg whioh does not f a l l w i t h i n my code of decency.
Two more points which should be recorded, both of which
swell of high pswerod d i r t y work - whether d i r t y work was
inteaiad or not. The f i r s t point i s that I , as T a l l y ' s
pre^eser, was not asked whether I had any objection em
behalf of my candidate, to the " date-*!terin«5* - I was l e f t
to f i n d eat myself. The second point has f a r more serious
implioatiaaa. I stress hare that I only suspect t h i s t e ha
t n M , although ray grounds f o r suspicion are vary strong*
Dm decision t o c a r r y out the "date altering"Mist have boss
wade before the Annual General Meeting,because the business
was mentioned to Wally (very indelicate) as soon as the
Meeting was over. The dates wore then a l t e r e d , unknown t o
s». My sneaking suspicion than i s that I have been
"silenced". I am not a member of the Union Council, so
that I cannot voice my opinions there, except by l e t t e r -
and where would that get me when the Council, I suspect,
i s hopelessly biased? The only way then i n whioh I could
have voiced my opinion i n p u b l i c before the elections
would have been at the A.G.M. - and I was not t o l d of tha
date a l t e r i n g decision, so that I could not ask questions.
However, I do not intend, to stand back and witness a grass
i n s u l t t o Wally - hence t h i s l e t t e r to F e l i x . Unfortoaato-
l y , F e l i x w i l l not be on s a l e u n t i l a f t e r the elections,
otherwise I should have had another means of s t a t i n g ay
ease*
I have heard much discussion from Wally' a opponents
about the wording on page kk of the I.C.Union Bye-Laws,,
but why discuss more wording when there i s an obvious
breach of the Constitution staring them i n the face?
There i s w r i t t e n i n black and white a passage which moans
that tha President s h a l l be elected before tha 12th June
each year - these elections w i l l a c t be hold u n t i l 13th
Juno. WILL THREE BE AN I.C. HRESIBENT AT THE BEGINNING OF
NEXT SESSION?
Tours disgustedly,

President I.C.Union to E d i t o r , FELIX
June 15th.
Dear S i r ,
I am grateful t o Mr Walters f o r giving me the opp-
ortunity of seeing h i s l e t t e r and of replying to i t imaed-
i a t e l y .
The j o i n t meeting of Council was delayed to June
18th, s i x days l a t e r than the c o n s t i t u t i o n a l date, principa-
l l y because of tha Coronation Celebrations j+.his i s u n f o r t -
unate, but would not seem to be relevant to the controversy
over eleotioas.
The nomination l i s t should have gone up 14 days
before the j o i n t Counoil Meeting and should have come down
2 days before the meeting. The turtles was i n fact put up f o r
convenience with ths ether nomination sheets on 27th May.
Nevertheless I decided that nominations should ho
accepted up to 2 days before the meeting.(Constitution*
Paragraph 7).
The proposer of any other nominee would i n fact
have had the strongest grounds for complaint had tha notiss
been taken down early. This decision involved a l t e r a t i o n ef
the notice, whioh was done a f t e r consultation with ths Sea-
rotary, and should i n courtesy have been oommunicated t o Mr
Walters as proposer of a presidential candidate. This was
not done, an omission for which I have already apologised i a
private to Mr Walters and now wish to do i n p u b l i c
By the time t h i s l e t t e r i s published a decision oa
t h i s matter w i l l have been reached by Counoil and the elect-
ion carried out, and I trust that any r u l i n g by t h i s elected
body w i l l have the f u l l support ef tha Union.

D.R.Walters to E d i t o r , FELIX June 15th.
Dear S i r ,
I also an grateful to Mr Maofie f o r giving aa the
opportunity of seeing h i s l e t t e r and of replying to i t imm-
ediately and f o r agreeing for m* t o have the "last word".
I also take o f f ay hat, i n publio, t o the ether presidential
proposer f o r preventing a very embarrassing s i t u a t i o n .
Everything mentioned i n Ron's l e t t e r has i t s answer
i n my o r i g i n a l e p i s t l e but I would l i k e to stress one point.
Ron has decided to aot s t r i c t l y according to the wording of
one part of the Constitution ( h i s interpretation) so I con-
tend that he should aot s t r i c t l y aocording t o ths whole
Constitution, i . e . the President s h a l l be elected before
12th. June. This loaves a large query i n my mind as to the
v a l i d i t y of next Thursday's elections. I should also l i k e
to repeat my previous statement that i t was rather i n d e l i c -
ate to mention t h i s "date a l t e r i n g " business to Welly before
i t was mentioned t o ae.
Before I close I should l i k e to stress that althon-
gh no punches have been pulled i n t h i s matter the whole bus-
iness has been conducted i n a very friendly Banner. There
have been long discussions but they have never been heated
and there has been no loss of temper.
However, I remain,
Tours as before,
D.R.WALTERS.
Dear S i r , - . . . .
. Having come to the Autumn of my academic career, and
being desirous of resting s. while ere Duty c a l l s , I find i t
extremely nerve-racking, when dozing i n the lounge, to be
woken by noisy children. I t i s '.veil known that bridge i s
a rowdy game, and an exciting one, but some of our enthusiasts
overstep the mark at times.
Recently another disturbance has been caused by. f l a n -
nelled fools at the radio receiver, anxious to hear the l a t -
est from the Test i n the loudest possible volume.
May I appeal, S i r , on behalf of the opressed minority
in the lounge, for a l i t t l e of the quietness which one
expects to find there?
