EditearsD.C.Kale. Circulation! 1200.
As the session draws rapidly to a close, we begin to
think of the sum.-r.er holidays} some of you might s t i l l be i n
the thick of exams, and as yet unable to dream away your
t i n e . While we are a l l looking eagerly ahead, a quick glance
backwards i n time w i l l do a l o t to encourage us.
In sports, the triumphs of I.C. are s t i l l fresh i n our
memory. Amongst ourselves, Guilds took the lion's share of
the various a t h l e t i c Cups— a p i t y nerhaps, but there i t i s .
For the people without two l e f t feeo, the three C a r n i v a l s —
.Fiesta, Nightmare, Gold Hush-- together with the Coronation
B a l l provided excellent opportunities. We ourselves remember
the FELIX birthday Dance v i v i d l y .
Though Nov. 5th was considered by many to be too gentle,
a l l i t s shortcomings were more than wiped out by the V i c t o -
r i a rag. After a l l the tears shed i n November, after laments
about "successive Presidents presenting the Union with
f a i t s accompli", i t was a worthy demonstration that there
i s s t i l l some s p i r i t l e f t i n I.C., that we are s t i l l cap-
able of energetic Rags.
I n January came the momentous announcement that I.C.
i s to be expanded to roughly double i t s present size.
Though t h i s w i l l take time, we must start thinking now
about our future strength, for i t i s going to have consider-
able e f f e c t s on the running of the Union.
Well, a l l that i s past. We hope you have pleasant
holidays i n many lands, and return to the Union f u l l of new
ideas and energy; a l s o , we hope, something to feed FELIX.
I f t h i s i s your f i n a l year, may we discreetly remind you
that FELIX w i l l keep you i n touch with I.C. wherever you
go? FELIX i s now feeling sleepy, and for once he can
afford to r e l a x , to ignore the goings-on. Just hear h i *
purr . . .

The FELIX Society reporter spent Coronation Day

A waiter i n a hurry s p i l l e d a tray of drinks over him.

',000 students are enrolling, on the average, at the Law
.faculty of P a r i s University every year; however, only 800
students graduate from t h i s Faculty per year (by obtaining
the "licence"). S i m i l a r ratios of students said graduates
p r e v a i l at the Philosophical and Medical Faculties of the
University. (Le Figaro, Paris)
"Studium generale" lectures at Wagenlngen have so f a r been
attended, on the average, by f i v e to s i x students only.
It i s envisaged to s h i f t these lectures to morning hours,
as obviously the competition of other events i s too strong
Ln the evenings. (WageningB Hogeschoolblad, V/ageningen).
The name of the National Union of Students, formerly the
Federacion Estudiantal de Ni aragua, has been changed recent-
ly to the Unid*n Nacional de Estudiantes. (Information.

The A. G. II. of I . C. Union was held on 11th June, with
not many people present. ~ i e f i r s t important matter was
the rejection by the Union of a Motion for sending n
Imperial College representative to the Bucharest F e s t i v a l .
On a show of hands, the Motive was defeated by a small
majority, but the meeting did not d i v i d e , since the President
announced that a majority of 100 would have been needed to
pass i t .
Presenting h i s Report for the year, the President,
t a l k i n g about proposed expansions, said, "The Student
Presidents were given the opportunity of stating t h e i r - we
hope - representative views on necessary Union and residen-
t i a l accommodation, to the Governing Body. As a result we
have an undertaking that the addition of two extra floors to
t h i s b u i l d i n g i s viewed only as providing the extra space
necessary for the present number of students and will not
prejudice the f u l l e r scheme proposed. This addition should
commence some time a f t e r next Easter. The large scheme we
suggested should include accommodation i n not too large Halls
of Residence for a minimum of 1000 students."

E. M. Hughes, Chairman of the A.C.C. had an
enviable job at the I.C. U.A.G.U. when he delivered h i s
Report, for Session 1952-53 has been the greatest even
in the history of Imperial College Sport. Ten U.L. Cups
have been won.
Hr. Hughes dealt with the increasing support of U.L.
Sport by I.C. He regarded i t as good p o l i c y , pointing out
the experience i t gives, as w e l l as the opportunity of
being spotted by County selectors. The R i f l e Club are
exceptional, i n not providing men for U.L., since i f they
did the U.L. R i f l e team would be the same as the I.C. team.
Entering i n the Inter University R i f l e Championships, I.C.
won, as w e l l as winning the U.L. League Trophy.
At the opposite extreme, another team with a b r i l l i a n t
record i s the Boxing Club, with one cancelled match to
t h e i r credit. The opponents, of course, were the defaulters
Hockey, weakened by having 5 men i n the U.L.team, were
only once able to turn out t h e i r strongest team. They
f a i l e d i n the Cup semi-final, casualties of overloyalty to
U.L.
Rugger, permanent custodians of the U.L. Cup, scored 62
points, with 6 against them i n t h i s year's competition. On
the morning of the Cup F i n a l an I.C. " f i r s t team" just missed
winning the University 7-a-side tournament.
The Boat Club are i n the middle of a very aiccessful
. ason, and are considered to have a chance i n the Thames
Cup at Henley. Fourth i n the Head of the River, they have
now embexked on a successful pot-hunting tour of th© summer
Regattas. Their successes are too numerous to relate.
Squash, sinning 27 out of 20 matches, are at t h e i r
zenith. At Torquay i n t h e i r West Country Tour they beat a
team consisting of an England player, 3 County players, and
another.
Cross Country and A t h l e t i c s have both pulled i n t h e i r
quota of U.L. Cups, they are eclipsed by the Women'n Sports
Clubs, whose successes have been honoured by the announcement
that Miss Janet Findlater has been invited to j o i n B r i t i s h
Universities i n the International Sports i n Germany t h i s sum-
mer.
Golf, not mentioned i n Mr. Hugheta summary, have been
beaten three times i n 25 matches.
A good season.
