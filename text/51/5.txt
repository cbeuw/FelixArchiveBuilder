On Saturday, 23rd May, Mr. N e i l Blackmore
was married to Miss Jacqueline Cohen at the
Holy T r i n i t y Church, P r i n c e Consort Road. The
reception was held at the Crofton H o t e l .
The Croons, aged 24, i s a well-known, second
year ohemist, and, at present, holds the p o s i t i o n
of president of the L i t . and Deb. Soc. The
B r i d e , aged 22, i s an a c t r e s s f o r the Croydon
Repertory Company. They f i r s t met l a s t summer
vacation i n the bedspread department of S e l f r i d g e s
where they were both working f o r a l i v i n g ! They
w i l l , u n t i l the summer, be dwelling i n Lancaster
Gate, and then go f o r a honeymoon i n Switzerland.
A f t e r the wedding they only took a weekend i n
Folkestone due to pressure of exams.
For the b e n e f i t of the l a d i e s , the Bride
wore (as f a r as the correspondent can remember)
a white wedding dress with a net v e i l . The two
Bridesmaids (aged 21 and Si) wore v a r y i n g shades
of blue. The p r i n c i p a l men were resplendent i n
morning dress! An e x c e l l e n t r e c e p t i o n was given
afterwards at which the Best Man was kissed by the
elder but not the younger Bridesmaid. The happy
p a i r were sent on t h e i r way to the s t a t i o n i n a
oar whose decorations r i v a l l e d those f o r the
Coronation. A r e a l l y enjoyable wedding; a l l best
wishes to N e i l and JacquiJ
Hugh C. Grigg.

The latest PH023IX i s the best for strae time. Buy i t .
I f you -re looking for as much humour or interest as you Can
get from l/6d. worth of Punch, then you w i l l be disappointed.
PHOENIX cannot and does not pretend to l i t e r a r y eminence; i t
provides a t r a i n i n g ground for young s c i e n t i s t s who need a
medium of s e l f expression. That s c i e n t i s t s need to express
themselves i s incontrovertible, and i s l u c i d l y amplified i n
an a r t i c l e "The Way \head", i n the PHOENIX under review.
J.A. Lusher and 3.R. Edwards, who contribute short
s t o r i e s , display a high order of technical a b i l i t y , but they
should both note that to t e l l a bad story w e l l i s only h a l f
the b a t t l e . Nevertheless, since neither of them f a l t e r s
u n t i l the closing l i n e s , each produces what a more fashionable
c r i t i c might c a l l "a rewarding experience." Ken Glover, i n
a very readable fragment, puts i n seme very effective
propaganda for washing machine shops. That he obviously
writes from the heart adds poignancy to his observations.
For good measure, there i s a Staggers Story, but not vintage.
People seldom look for poetry i n PHOENIX, but t h i s time
they w i l l find i t . There -\re two pages of pseudopoetic
composition, but three l i n e s of i t , towards the end of the
second page, are worth reading more than once.
The outspoken essay, "The Forbidden Knowledge", which
appeared i n the Spring Edition, has provoked a reply, complete
with a formidable array of references, i n which Pschycology i s
torn down from the pedestal on which "Rufus" set i t , and
Religion substituted instead. Unfortun t e l y , the destruction
i s done more e f f e c t i v e l y than the substitution, and we are
back where we sta.rted. But high power controversies l i k e
t h i s make excellent reading, i f only you would bother to read
them. They are the best c f a l l possible material for
PHOENIX.
A comparison between l i f e i n America and England makes an
interesting a r t i c l e by Pamela. Fry.
Louis Cohen, i n "Science and the Press" deals with the
a c t i v i t i e s of the Scriblerus Club, who spent a month cutting
out science news from the newspapers. The results are
surprising and (to use an "O.K." word) "revealing." The
popular press i s too much concerned with unimportant things
to have spa.ee for science. The blame l i e s largely on our
side, since we i n s u f f i c i e n t l y ejoperienced i n l e t t e r s to make
our work i n t e l l i g i b l e to the nonscientist. Perhaps PHOENIX
serves a useful purpose here.
