Three eights have represented the College during the
past three weekends both on the Tideway at Chiswiok and up
r i v e r at Walton and Reading.
CHTSWICK REGATTA
day.
This proved to be a disappointing
The 1st eight competing i n the Thanes Cup event f a i l e d
to settle down after a bad start and lost t o
University College, the eventual winners, by 3 f t -
The Junior Senior eight after a bad start fought
hard i n rough and trying conditions but lost t o
Midland Bsnk beating Northampton Engineering College
into t h i r d place. Midland Bank were the eventual
winners.
Similarly the Junior eight had t o row i n such condi-
tions and lost to- Quinton School. .
.
WALTON REGATTA The day provided a f i t t i n g reward
for continuous and hard training.-
The Walton Challenge Cup for Thames Cup crews was won
by the 1st eight after an enjoyable afternoon's
rowing.
Both Junior Senior and Junior crews competed, each
winning t h e i r f i r s t heat. Unfortunately the effects
of the Coronation B a l l made themselves f e l t and both
lost t o the f i n a l i s t i n the next heats.
READTHO REGATTA The f i r s t eight racing i n the
Thames Cup event enjoyed another day of good but hard
rowing. From the sixteen crews entered, including two fast
college boats from Oxford, the Royal A i r Force end I.C.
rowed t h e i r way t o the f i n a l . At the start the R.A.F. went
s l i g h t l y ahead and maintained t h i s position throughout the
race despite a determined effort by I.C. t o row through
them. The result being a win f o r the R.A.F. a remarkably
f i t crew, by •§• length.
The Junior crew unfortunately had a "shipwreck" i n t h e i r
race after going o f f well from the start and l o s t t o the
National Provincial Baik.
Preparations for examinations are f e l t t o have had their|
affects on the crews. The 1st eight with the exaii3. behind
them are looking forward to meeting the R.A.F. on the longer
Henley course.

Sports Day was poorly attended as usual, but the Hop
held the same evening was comfortably crowded. The out-
standing event at Harlington was a g l i d i n g display i n
which President Macfie appeared towed by an aeroplane
p i l o t e d by h i s brother. After casting o f f (as i n knitting)
he gave a t h r i l l i n g display of manoeuvres t o the breath-

The 1st XI has shown much improvement and recently
scored meritorious v i c t o r i e s over two''Oxford Colleges.
They also had much the better of a drawn gome with Ealing
Dean. Kitchen, a solid opening batsman, has continued h i s
run of good scores and Oldland has shown a. return to form
with 77 against Keble College and 55 against Ealing Dean.
I. C. paid t h e i r annual pilgrimage to Hook (Hants) on
Whit Monday and were favoured with glorious weather. The
team f o r t i f i e d themselves i n The Dorchester Arms before tak-
ing the field.and the wisdom of such t a c t i c s was amply
demonstrated when Hook had scored 6 f o r 6. The lunchtime
score was 18 for 6, but the enormous luncheon was too much
for I . C. and Hook amassed 67. Hitchen and Willmor, a
perfect combination between the rackets, opened f o r I . C.
but there was a collapse and we were a l l out f o r 41.
Another immense meal, combined with a short bowling s p e l l
by K. Wer.le, made the game safe for Hook who made about 120
i n t h e i r second innings t o which I . C. replied with 91.
KiR. M i l l e r (Australia) watched the last hour or so of
the gome and stated that t h i s to him seemed the ideal type
of cricket. He and another Australian were defeated i n a
darts match with K. Weale and R. Reynolds and we took t h i s
to be a good omen for Trent Bridge.

A C . BEAT CUP HOLDERS.
I.C. regained the Tennis Cup which they held i n
1951 by defeating U.C. by f i v e matches to three ( one unfto
ished) i n the f i n a l l a s t Sunday at Motspur Park.
After each p a i r had played two matches the teens went t o
tea with the score at three a l l , Foreterand Ward having won
two matches, and McDonald and Paige,one. After t e a , I.C.
qulokly gained a winning lead, T o r s t e r and Ward, and Foster
B u r r i l l , winning i n straight sets.
Safety was necessarily the keynote In most of the matches
and as U.C. tended-to slow the games up as much as pose-*""*
when l o s i n g , the tennis was not of exceptionally high stan-
dard but nontheless very interesting to the small gallery
supporting I.C.
P a r t i c u l a r mention must be made o f I.C.'s p a i r Forster
and Ward, who play regularly for U.L., and who went right
through the U.L. Cup Competition without losing a match.

Athletic Club t r a v e l l e d to Loughborough to participate i n a
