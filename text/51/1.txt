R.C.S. IN THE SWIM
Members of R.C.S. who walked past Guild's just after
lunch on 29th »

.
y were not surprised at the horrible smell
d r i f t i n g through the doors, for i t was known that the Guilds
were holding t h e i r A.G.l!. and Presidential Elections; and
when you get several hundred of them together
P h i l i p Allsopp, presiding over the meeting, sniffed
••delicately -nd expressed the opinion that "Gentlemen,
jthcre i s a member of R.C.S. here somewhere." Mr. Allsopp,
'retiring President, was presented, i n token of h i s services,
with two books. Lest worse b e f a l l , suffice i t to toy that
the;- were printed i n English i n France, -nd are brut what
you expect.
CORONATION CAPERS
Imperial College celebrated the Coronation i n i t s own
way. A large contingent chose to greet the Great Day from
,( the etreets of London, with a heap of papers under one arm,
and thouting "Daily Hr.il. Everest Special Coronation
Edition." Our reporter, up a l l night, describes the t h r i l l
of "being a link i n the chain which started with a b r i e f
wireless message, then a youth with a banner, running down
a mountain to the North of Khatraondu, then another wireless
'message, then a printing press, then rae." Everybody i n the
crowd was mad keen to buy a paper - one lady bough' two dozen
to s i t on. The p o l i c e , brawny countrymen with a glorious
variety of accents were, of course, not supposed to read on
duty. Nevertheless, "Fold one up, son, and s l i p i t under
my cape", was heard more than once. Another paper s e l l e r
reports how he entered a grandstand at Marble Arch at
6 a.m., sold a l l h i s papers, end decided to stay there.
A f t e r waiting seven hours a.steward came up and demanded to
see h i s t i c k e t . The inevitable happened and he watched the
procession from a dreadful position i n the street.
The whole idea of s e l l i n g newspapers was to have enough
money to go to the B a l l . Excitement ran fever high, f o r
those who were i n the Union on Coronation Eve saw the
f r a n t i c and very noble efforts raa.de by a group of enthu-
s i a s t s i n transforming the Lounges, Gym., and Dining H a l l
into appropriate arenas. The tennis courts too were
equipped with dance f l o o r s , floodlighting and beer garden.
Prior to the ball, a host of very t a s t e f u l and witty
advertisements had appeared, and a specimen t i c k e t was
shown. These tickets were master pieces of a r t and p r i n t -
ing, and the world flocked t o buy them. We were also told
that we were t o be allowed to keep tnem,but that, lest any
vhould be used twice, they were to be franked on the back
with "a specially made stamp."
With Borne eagerness,'then,I handed i n my t i c k e t at mid-
night on Coronation Day, and i t was handed back to me,
stamped. And how delightful to find that the special stamp
was a signature of I.C. Hon. Secretary W.P. Goss.'
The rain made a mess of tenniB-court plans, and the
Union was very crowded, resulting i n a l i t t l e chaos,
especially when several hundreds had to stand for a quarter
of an hour holding glasses of wine, waiting to toast the
Queen. Mention should be made here of the Cad who set off
a firework in the Upper Dining Hall, causing wine to be
•pilled over many dresses.
^ The supper, fresh salaon or ham salad, and wine, was
very good. In fact, a good time was had by a l l .
In the Elections, Ron George became President, and Tony
G i l l Vice- President, with Edward J . Taylor Hon. Sec. A
clay pipe was presented to i.ir. Selby, oldest established
member of the Union, leaving t h i s year. The previous day,
i n the R.C.3.H.A .C-.U., Jim Anderson ha.d taken h i s place as
new President amid tumultuous cheers, with the new Vice
President, John Hathaway.
After the Union Meeting, Guilds assembled outside
R.C.S. to start the F i e l d Cup Race. Each department had tc
make a crown, and carry i t i n procession i n a palanquin to
the Serpentine, where a waiting boat bore i t , l i k e Iting
Arthur, to the other side, thence to be disembarked and
rushed to Knightsbridge where Derek Crossley, disguised as
an Ex Eastern Monarch, was waiting to be crowned, seated of
course on the Coronation stone. None of the boats sunk th
t h i s year (c.f. F i e l d Cup 1950), although a number of
swimmers did t h e i r best to cause a maximum of chaos,
Chemical Engineers won for the f i r s t time ever, C i v i l s being
second.
Following the base instinct of revenge, Guilds then
marched to R.'C.S. A witness who was inside R.C.S. at the
time t e l l s us, "The f i r s t sign that anything was wrong
occurred when I •** t h e porter rush to the main door, and
bar i t . In a few minutes time i t became clear that the
rabble outside was i n a dangerous mood. We tried to
quieten thorn down with a hose pipe, sticking out of the
cloakroom window, but water pressure was low and we only suc-
ceeded i n wetting ourselves. Then the Guilds discovered
that they could enter R.C.S. by a side door, and in a few
minutes a dreadful scene was displayed before me. Women
and children were fleeing along corridors hotly pursued by
the ravaging hordes who brandished spurting f i r e -
extinguishers. Guilds also managed to get hold of a large
hose-pipe, and they used i t to great advantage on the R.C.S.
corpses which were l y i n g around. The building was almost
completely wrecked."
A V.I.P. who was i n conference at the time i n R.C.S. i s
understood .(FELIX Underground Hews Service) to have said,
"There must be some changes here."
And the soaking multitudes agreed.
L O S T H O U R S
In connection with the FELIX exposure of a f i l a which
(we alleged) libelled R.C.S. (sea FELIX 45 ), after
prolonged negotiations between the distributors of the
f i l m and the Royal College of Science, a number of R.C.S.
o f f i c i a l s have been invited to a private viewing of the
f i l m . The distributors claim that the film "Lost Hours"
contains nothing which can be considered i n any way
l i b e l l o u s . We await further developments with interest.
