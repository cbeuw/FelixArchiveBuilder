President Obama wants to enjoy closer diplomatic ties with Russia than
his predecessor
In a letter which was hand delivered to the Kremlin last month, Obama
asked for greater collaboration between the two nations on the Iranian issue.
In return, Obama offered to suspend plans for a US missile defence shield
being built in Eastern Europe, which Russia has deemed to be threatening
its own security.
The Russian government does not have any hand in Iran’s missile program,
most of the help on that comes from North Korea. However Iran is a market
for Russian weaponry, airliners, and civil nuclear technology. As such, it has
stronger cards to play at the negotiations table, and could back the tougher
sanctions on Iran demanded by the United States.

President Raúl Castro has marked his first year anniversary in power by
having a major cabinet reshuffle.
The reshuffle has seen 10 officials step down, including two well-known
loyalists of former President Fidel Castro. The transition of power from Fidel
Castro, who ruled Cuba ever since the communist revolution in 1959, to his
brother Raúl has taken place quite smoothly.
The shake-up also included the merger of several ministries in order to
make the ageing communist bureaucracy more efficient. It comes at a time
of improving US-Cuban ties, as well as better ties with Latin America, China
and old cold war ally Russia too.

UN – The Hague
Radovan Karadzic has refused to enter a plea at a pre-trial meeting of
the UN tribunal at The Hague (in the Netherlands) where he is accused
of committing war crimes.
Mr Karadzic, a former political leader of Bosnian Serbs during the Yugo-
slav civil war in the 1990s, was arrested in Serbia in July 2008 after spending
a decade in hiding disguised as a doctor of alternative medicine. The exact
charges made by prosecutors at the International Criminal Tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia (ICTY) include two counts of genocide and five counts of
crimes against humanity between 1992 and 1995.
The trial has been broadcast on
TV in Bosnia, but judges have admit-
ted that the proceedings have made
virtually no progress since last July.
Many observers believe Karadzic is
using delaying tactics pioneered by
former Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic who was also on trial at the
ICTY, but died in 2006 before a ver-
dict was delivered.
Imperial College accused of cheating in
University Challenge show
Jovan Nedić
Editor in Chief
Earlier this week, the University Chal-
lenge team from Curpus Christi, Ox-
ford, were disqualified for fielding an
ineligible member, after it was found
out that Sam Kay had graduated in
June 2008 and was currently work-
ing for PricewaterhouseCoopers in
Reading.
Past presenter Bamber Gascoigne
has lambasted the BBC telling the Ra-
dio 4’s The World Show that “To fail to
produce a University Challenge based
on university life not within a single
The halls of residence is Evelyn Gardens have seen a rise in rent, all except Fisher Hall which remains
unchanged
university year is pathetic.” Current
presenter Jeremy Paxman told the BBC
that “I do feel sorry for the Corpus
Christi team - but rules are rules, and
they had to be stuck to.”
In a joint statement from the BBC
and Granada, they said: “The Universi-
ty Challenge rules on student eligibility
are that students taking part must be
registered at their university or college
for the duration of the recording of the
series.”
Ever since this small “fiasco”, there
have been reports claiming that other
university teams had also fielded in-
eligible members in their team. Earlier
this week The Times had reported that
two members from the Imperial Col-
lege team that won in 2001 had already
graduated when the show was being
filmed.
There are no reports on what might
happen to the previous teams if they
are found to have actually cheated, but
one thing that will need to be looked at
are the rules. Since the show is filmed
over the summer and effectively cover-
ing two academic years, it will mean
that third year students and below will
be the only ones eligible to participate,
something which some students might
find particularly annoying.
The cost of renting Imperial College
accommodation has had its annual re-
view, with rents rising by 3.9% on aver-
age. However, Fisher Hall has escaped
the rise.
Deputy President (Education & Wel-
fare), Hannah Theodorou, passed on
details of the rent prices for Imperial
Accommodation for the 2009-10 ses-
sion earlier today, following a meeting
with the Committee on Student Resi-
dences. The rents are once again clas-
sified into different “bands” (A-F) and
then into different room types: a sys-
tem set up by the committee in 2008.
The rent review means that next
year, the average price of renting Im-
perial College Accommodation will be
£130.98. 27% of bed spaces will have a
rent of less than £102.27 per week, 54%
will be less than £118.86 per week and
7% of bed spaces will cost more than
£177 per week.
Fisher Hall is the only hall in Central
London to escape the rise in rent, with
prices sticking at £92.40 per week for
the cheapest single rooms and a very
low £54.46 for a place in a triple room.
This is to “provide a lower cost hall
offering”. The report notes that refur-
bishment in Fisher Hall will be carried
out in Summer 2009, as planned. Miss
Theodorou told Live!, “I am pleased
with the freeze in Fisher’s rent, provid-
ing students with a low-cost accommo-
dation option within walking distance
of the campus. This will be happening
despite a refurbishment this summer”.
Postgraduate accommodation at
Clayponds is set to increase by around
5.5% in order to reflect the refurbish-
ment that has been carried out. Any-
one living in areas which are still await-
ing refurbishment will only be charged
half of this increase (this affects 183 of
the 330 bed spaces). This leaves the av-
erage price rise in these halls at 3.9%.
Rents at Silwood will be increasing
by 5.1%, with a standard single room
costing £80.41 per week a twin room
charged at £133 per week between two
people, a couple or family flat being
charged at £172.88 per week and a bun-
galow now being charged at £204.25
per week. Twenty-eight beds at Wil-
liam Penney will be frozen at this year’s
prices (£72.52 per week), “following
feedback from students”. The freeze in
rent at William Penney leaves the aver-
age price rise at Silwood at 3.9%.
In all other halls, the aim has been
to widen the price difference between
multiple and single occupancy rooms.
This means that rents multiple occu-
pancy rooms are being increased by
2.5% and single rooms and flats are be-
ing increased by 4.6%. Once again, this
gives the average increase of 3.9%.
The report notes that The London
School of Economics “is proposing a
base increase of 5% with some halls
increasing by as much as 12%”, which
I presume is supposed to make us feel
better about the increase.
This Live! reporter notices that the
report only compares the increase that
LSE is putting forward, rather than
how the prices themselves compare to
those at Imperial College (they could
have been much lower before the in-
crease). For example, LSE has beds in
twin rooms available at £67 per week
in Islington and £75 per week near
Tottenham Court Road. Maybe this is
something that the report can look at
in 2010.
The report also comments upon pri-
vate housing. It says that whilst there
has been a reduction in the average
weekly rent for private housing across
London, rent in the Kensington area
did increase during 2008. The report
says that “in any case, it is still cheaper
to stay in halls”.
The report assumes that students
who live in private housing live in
Kensington, saying: “An average three
bed house in South Kensington has a
weekly rent of £800 p/wk or £266 per
room. This excludes shared expenses
such as utilities that add a further £26
p/wk. A private housing alternative is
therefore approximately £292 p/wk for
a room compared to £176.47 for a band
E single ensuite in Southside.”

The Israeli housing ministry plans to build 73,000 new settlements in
the West Bank
These figures, released by the Israeli group Peace Now, have been denied
by the Israeli government. The group however, says it has obtained data indi-
cating that 15,000 new units had already been approved, and a further 58,000
were waiting approval. This doubling of settlement capacity in the Palestin-
ian territory has been condemned by the Palestinian authority and by the
EU.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clin-
ton was in the region this week,
meeting first with Israeli leaders and
then with Palestinian leaders in the
West Bank. She has been urged to put
pressure on Israel to back down from
its settlement expansions. At present
over 500,000 Israeli settlers live in the
West Bank and East Jerusalem settle-
ments, all of which are illegal under
international law.
