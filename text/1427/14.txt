Coffee Break
T
his week I finally read a
real, made from paper,
book. Up until this point I
had only read 1 book be-
fore. Well besides the Biff
and Chip collection at primary school.
That book was harry potter! Then the
movies came out and I gave up. Well
the book I read was Oscar wild’s short
stories. Yes I know it was written for
children, but it was really really good.
When I say this I mean it! It’s not of-
ten I read in general, heck I struggle to
read my own lecture notes (but that is
most likely due to my bad hand writ-
ing). Point being, I don’t consider read-
ing literature an important part of my
life. I also imagine many of you do the
same. Sure I know lots of people read
books nightly, however I am sure many
people just don’t bother like me. Why
wouldthey,Icanbetyouthatmorepeo-
ple at imperial have a laptop (or com-
puter) than a book to reed at night. In
conjunction with the interwebz, there
is a plethora of interesting material to
reed. Wether it be the latest blog post
by Stephen Fry, or the news. It would
seem the printed word is becoming
obsolete. I can’t begin to imagine a day
where this newspaper (felix incase you
Ravi Pall
Coffee Break Editor
had forgotten) becomes an online pub-
lication. This would be unfortunate,
however with news also breaking out
in competition (read Live), the only
saving grace I can see is the fact felix is
free. Let me assure you, it will continue
to be free and awesome. My point here
is that there will come a point where
books will become obsolete. Have you
guys ever heard of Amazons Kindle
II? Is a sweet slim line device made
by Amazon, that had wireless broad-
band built in. It connect directly to the
amazon store and downloads any book
they have available. Using the large E
Ink screen when the page is loaded, it
uses no battery. Practically the same
as a book right”? The difference is this
time you have access to thousands of
books in one device. It can also read
the books out to you! Who knows, all
I’m saying is that I enjoyed reading a
book, and I may make things easier for
me and buy an audio book.
In other news, have you seen all the
texts we got in from the rugby team.
LOLZ. Chill the fuck out bros. Horo-
scopes are there to be nasty, sure this
time they were nasty to you, but I am
sure whoever wrote them thought it
was an appropriate thing to do at the
time. twitter.com/D00SKI
