Basically, you get points for doing all the various puzzles and chal-
lenges, and at the end of the year, the winning team and the win-
ning individual will win an iPod nano! The scoring is as follows:
5 points for the first correct answers for Slitherlink, Wordoku, Lon-
don Underground, Mentalist Maze and Quickie. 4 points for second,
3 points for third, 2 points for fourth and 1 point for fifth.
Double points will be awarded for correct cryptic crossword an-

Simple! Now then FUCWITs, send in your answers to felix@impe-

This week felix was so short staffed that it had to recruit some of last year’s writers. Say hi to Matty Hobag!
Virgo
If you want to know
what the censored
words are above
then please ring
0800767544. Calls cost
£3 an hour with an additional
£20 answer disclosure fee, terms and conditions apply. Please ask the
billpayer for permission before ringing or I will
come find you, rip out your windpipe and use
it as a flute when I next play with the London
Philharmonic Orchestra.
Scorpio
If toilets could talk
they’d tell you stop
having steaks three
times a day. You keep
convincing yourself
that it is your ‘thing.
“Hey! I’m the steak guy!” is how you’ll introduce
yourself whilst your sweat smells of lard and your
heart is reading Kurt Cobain’s diaries to get some
tips. Actually, that’s fucking ridiculous, as if hearts
could read books. THEY HAVE NO FINGERS.
Libra
“When there’s
something
straaaaange in your
neighbourhoooood.
Who you gonna
avoid? WEIRD
HOMELESS GUY!” I tell you, if I heard this
song at school I wouldn’t have a tattoo on my
chest of a naked nun eating a kebab. Mind you,
that was one fun night, I just wish that I never
drank that white spirit whilst on fire.
Capricorn
I’m sorry, I think we got
off on the wrong foot. I
guess it all started from
me going on about
AIDS. What I know you
would really like me to
do is sidle up next to you at night and just lick the
back of your neck incessantly. Who knows? Maybe
that’s why I hate you and your ridiculous orange
coloured tracksuit bottoms. I hope you and Jade
Goody are happy together. Pint?
Sagittarius
Anyway, yeah, stop
eating those steaks
or I’ll come round
to your house and
attach car batteries to
all your doorknobs.
And then whilst you are passed out, I will come
round and put make-up on you and force you to
fornicate with a baby-seal in lingerie, film it and
send it to your parents as their next anniversary
present.
Cancer
AHHHH GO FUCK
YOURSELF. I was
trying to have a
joke and a laugh
about the current
economic crisis and
you just take my shitty joke and have a go at me.
I wish you would just for once think about what
you are doing to my self-esteem and how you
make me cry and hurt me inside until I KEEP
BLEEDING, I KEEP, KEEP BLEEDING.
Gemini
This guy had three
daughters who all
worked as credit
controllers at
Experian. The father,
after being turned
down for one too many credit cards tried to pull
weight with his daughters to get a Mastercard.
They failed to comply so he smashed in their
kneecaps with a lumphammer. Now that’s a
credit crunch.
Leo
Later today you will
fuck your friend
Lucy Spiggenhole in
the eyeball. At first
you’ll feel awkward
about it, then later
you’ll come to realise that irreversible eye
damage is no subject matter for a horoscope.
You’ll laugh about this in the future and re-
enact the day her cornea got split wide open.
Her guide-dog then pisses on your leg.
Taurus
This week you
reinvent the light
bulb but make it
from a goat’s stomach
and a bluebottle fly’s
wings. Your penchant
for inventing things from animal parts is
beginning to ostracize your flatmates. But they
are perhaps more annoyed that your flat now
smells like a farmer’s armpit in Summer Shit
Season.
Aries
What the fuck is
wrong with you?
Why would you do
that to your own
grandmother? She’s
been THROUGH
TWO WORLD WARS only for you to explain
teabagging to her. You always knew she had a
dodgy heart and a fear of testicles. I hope you
burn in a cesspit in hell. Otherwise, your week
will smell of primroses and elderflower.
Pisces
You know what?
You’ve got the feeling
that this week is
going to be better
than last week. Well
you’re wrong. Very
wrong. Really, really, really wrong. Wronger
than wronger than wrong. Wrong wrong
wrong wrong wrong, wrong wrong wrong
wrong wrong. WRONGINGTON, capital of
WRONG. You die of nappy-rash.
Aquarius
Guess who’s back,
back again? Aids is
back, wash a friend.
In all seriousness, if
you have AIDS do
not wash a friend as
you might give them Skin AIDS. The easiest
way to spot Skin AIDS is if the sufferer has the
sudden impulse to shove cotton wool into the
rectum to prevent them ‘giving birth to an ass
demon’.

Last week’s winners were Shotgun. Bi-
zarrely, no one else entered the quick
crossword solution. Are we making
them too hard for you guys out there
or are you all just getting a little bit
lazy?
Anyway, here’s another one for you
to have a go at, let’s hope we got more
answers in this week.
Oh and the horoscopes are pretty
funny this week.

How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be
one continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

Shotgun have crushed the tiny
gap at the top of FUCWIT. Well
done to you. No really I am glad
that you are doing this and not
listing to your lecture. I think this
can only improve your degree
prospects. ACIDSPERM.

“To the wanker at Imperial, com-
ment on our hooker when you have
the balls to come play with us. x”
“Froggy, ignore last week’s horrible
comment. I still love you and you
can kick me anytime!”
“Whoever sent that text in about
the ic hooker, you’re a knob. Go
fuck yourself you pussy. Like to see
you do his job you talentless twat.
We still love you froggy! x”
“To whoever sent in about the ic
hooker. I sure u wrote that stupid
txt in anger after findin our yr
mums a whore.
” (Speak English)
“To anti hooker texter, you better
hope no one knows you sent that.
We will find you.

clever)
“Your a pussy. You went to a school
full of knobs and you are a knob

Going Underground
You are all fucking idiots. The first
slightly tricky one I put in any you are
all looking for a big paddle. For those
of you who do care the correct answer
was the oh-so-obscure HACKNEY
CENTRAL. Do it this week or risk de-
fenestration from Beit.

= 2+1+14+11=28. Job done.
So which London tube station sums to 162?
This week’s texts Rugby Rants:
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
162
=
_
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.
Mentalist Maze...
Maze generator fucked up this
week, but I found you one anyways.
Because I am awesome. Last week’s
winners were Shotgun, (insert abuse
here). Little known fact, mazes were
originally invented by the Romans
with a hot chick in the middle- first to
find her, nails her. Bish bash bosh!
1,426 Solution
Well done to Jov’s Mum who entered
this week. Didn’t win, but that’s not
what counts. Shotgun did win, so I
danced round the office and then cock
strangled them.
