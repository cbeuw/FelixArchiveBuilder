New season old memories
Milan Fashion Week
It was a fairytale for Milan
Fashion Week. Agatha Ruiz
de la Prada, famous for her
colourful and fun designs, in-
jected a childhood legacy into
her A/W 09 RTW show. The
show opened with an upside
down umbrella that probably
won’t prove very useful in
London. A dress perfect for
seduction, equipped with a
piano keyboard printed on
the side. A tablecloth-dress
with two eggs accessorised
with a baguette hat that are
reminiscent of a tea party. No
sarcasm, check out the collec-
tion. http://content.coutorture.

Dolce for Gisele
Congratulations to Gisele who
married Tom Brady in a Dolce
and Gabbana gown last week.
Her ivory wedding dress was
strapless with a trumpet skirt
and a long train.
No More Arena
Arena, “Britain’s original
style magazine for men” has
suspended publication after 22
years. The final issue goes on
sale on the 12th March. At the
mean time, Conde Nast has
launched a fashion biannual
called “LOVE” in February.
Editor-in-Chief Katie Grand -
who also founded Dazed and
Confused - promises that the
magazine will be “real”. With
the first issue featuring a half
naked Beth Ditto on the front
cover, we trust that Katie is for
real.
