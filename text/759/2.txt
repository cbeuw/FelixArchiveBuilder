Report
Defended
Dear David,
I would like to defend Mark
Cottle's report of the last Council in
FELIX. As Council Chair I was in
the best position to judge what
prompted Ian Howgate's protest. It
was my ruling that minutes of sub-
committees of Council cannot be
referred back. M r Howgate
suggested that the Academic affairs
Officer's report should be referred
back. There was no AAO's report
submitted to Council so I assumed
that Mr Howgate was talking about
the minutes of the Academic Affairs
Committee. It amazes me that Mr
Howgate cannot distinguish
between minutes and a report.
Council minutes cannot be referred
back because Council is meant to
discuss the decisions made by its
sub-committees. If one refers back
to the minutes it means Council
can't discuss what is being done in
its name for a month. Council is not
meant to discuss the accuracy of
minutes.
Mr Howgate's walk out showed a
complete lack of understanding of
the way council works. If Mr
Howgate disagrees with the
decisions I make about the running
of Council, he can challenge my
ruling. This means that had the
majority of Council wanted sub-
committee minutes referred back it
could have happened. I am more
than willing to explain how Council
works to Mr Howgate or anyone
else.
There also seems to be some silly
idea that all minutes, reports etc
should be circulated a week in
advance. Ideally they should, but
often sub-committee meetings take
place less than a week before
Council. Council's most important
job is to control finance. The
committee that advises Council on
this, Union Finance Committee
(UFC), meets three days before
Council. Finance decisions have to
be noted by Council almost
immediately if Council is to have a
chance to alter UFC's decision. It
would be stupid for Council to
consider UFC's decisions about a
month after they were taken. In
addition, the minutes for the last
minutes were not produced because
Dave Colley was ill.
I could criticise other statements
made by Mr Howgate, Mr Seymour
and Mr Brandon but I won't
because I'm sure that you are
already bored with what seems like
petty bitching. Perhaps people
should consider promoting the
Union rather than bitching in
FELIX. Bitching just makes the
Union look stupid.
Yours
D Hugh Southey
Council Chair
Howgate
Bombarded
Dear Dave,
I feel it has reached the point
where I have undergone about as
much bombardment as it is possible
to take. Therefore, if anyone is
interested, I would like to point out
the actual reasons why I left the last
meeting of Union Council. As has
been pointed out by certain
members of that committee, papers
(which number around 20 sides of
A4) were handed out on the day of
that meeting. Approximately 50%
of these were available on entry, the
result was that representatives could
not consult their constituences
about the information included,
look into problems more deeply or
personally research anything; in
some cases the papers could not
even be read. This was the second
time in succession that this had
occured; I work very hard as Dep
Rep and have better things to do
than waste time (around 3 hours)
turning over pieces of paper that I
have not had time to read. For
Council to pass this literature
without proper discussion makes
Council a 'farce', which was my
point at the time. Very few Dep
Reps even turn up to council, as they
believe it achieves little of relevance
to their constituency, and if
information upon council is of such
a limited extent as has been the case
at the last two meetings I must agree
with my absent colleagues. I was
wrong to leave the council at that
stage as I should have stood up for
my principles. I have learned this
lesson and have realised how much
the truth can be distorted in one's
absence. Nevertheless council have
decided in my absence to improve
the distribution of papers.
As for electioneering I happily
admit that I am likely to stand for
President this term, but to suggest
my actions at the last Council were
carried out with this intent is a joke;
this was a gut-reaction to a situation
which at the time appalled me. I
would like to say that I did not
'attack' anyone, I feel Chas
Jackson, (Publicity Officer) has
done a good job so far, but that he is
not supported enough and
suggested ways he might help
himself deal with his workload, he
himself said at a later date, he did
not feel he had been slagged off. My
actions were not an attack on Hugh
Southey, who I feel has done well, or
the exec, who have stood up for us
better than most would realise. I do
however feel they were mis-guided
in allowing Council to take place
under these circumstances, but that
is all. At the same time I am not
frightened to stand up alone if
necessary for what I feel is right.
I am sorry to see that Mark Cottle
has decided to leave his job
u n f i n i s h e d and hope his
replacement is enthusiastic; I look
forward to working with whoever it
may be as most Council should do,
for this is where Our strength lies,
squabbling and petty accusations
act only to aid our enemies.
The only advice I wish to give Pete
Wilson is that people who live in
glass houses should not throw
stones.
Yours, Ian Howgate
In Defence
Dear Dave.
Referring to the article titled
"Shallow Policy of Electioneers" in
Felix No 758 (page 2), I would like
to point out some of the facts the
writer of this article failed to see.
Most suggestions (attacks?) need
not be considered as personal at all,
especially regarding people holding
Union posts. Now as for Mr Chas
Jackson, unless he has a publicity
team, I would conclude that he does
all the "smooth running" of
publicity as a one-man team (alone).
I am sure most people would agree
with my understanding of Ian
Howgate's suggestion, i.e. a
committe would function much
better than Chas "alone", isn't that
obvious to you Mr Wilson? That
could also cut down the time Chas
spends making and distributing
posters, at the expense of his
valuable study time. In addition,
that would also provide Mr Jackson
with enough time to spend oh
designing good quality posters, and
surprise surprise, the committee
would do the distribution for him!
Lastly, I won't be surprised in the
least, if you Mr Wilson, don't -
"Vote Howgate for President - the
man who sets up committees,"
because they are personal attacks on
other students (??). Don't forget that
if we can reduce the amount of work
done by an individual, there could
be a much better chance to get
people "out of goodwill," who can
offer best services to the Union, and
hence that may keep Ian Howgate
and you happy!!
Yours faithfully,

NUS And
Abortion
Dear Sir,
Arguments about the pros and
cons of the NUS are usually draped
in political colours. This need not
always be the case, however.
The NUS annually donates Â£ 1000
of its funds to the National
Abortion Campaign (NAC) and
actively supports its policies which
include:
a) Introduction of legislation
which would allow anyone,
including non-medical persons, to
perform abortions.
b) Abortion on demand up to
birth with no medical or legal
restrictions.
You don't have to be vehemently
against abortion to acknowledge the
extremity of such policies, if only in
the fact that they would pose a
severe health hazard to women
procuring abortions from untrained
people, or even carrying it out
themselves.
Moreover, among the aims of the
NAC, is that "all anti-abortion
doctors holding positions in which
they can directly or indirectly
obstruct a woman seeking an
abortion are to be removed from
such posts". This seems to deny the
right of conscientious objection to
any pro-life doctors as well as to
some of the 27,000 medical students
within the NUS. There are pro-life
students on both sides of the
political divide, as I witnessed when
I attended a pro-life student vigil
near "Little Ben" at Victoria Station
at the end of last term (see "feminists
turn against abortion" - Daily
Telegraph, December 23rd).
Indeed, such students will stand for
executive posts on the NUS at the
Easter Conference in March. They
may not get very far, but they will
show that you don't have to be a
rabid fascist -to have disagreements
with the NUS.
Yours sincerely,
Paul Kapusta

Letter
Dear Dave,
After the flood of letters last week
regarding Ian R . M . Howgate
(henceforth I.R.M.H.) I think it is
time to inform you of the actual
state of affairs. There is no I.R.M.H.
publicity machine, there is, however
an organisation which people might
assume to fulfill its duties - the
committe to elect I.R.M.H. As yet
the committee's activities have been
covert although some suspicious
souls have begun to detect its
existence.
All I can say at present is that if
people think this powerful
undercover organisation's activities
to date have been ruthless they
should wait and see what happens
when it comes into the open.
Yours,
David Lowrie,
Chairman,
Committee to Elect (A.A.O)
