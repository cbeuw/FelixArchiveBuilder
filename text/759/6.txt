A cynic's eye
guide to the
UFO
controversy.
By
Chris Edwards
UFO's have been reported and
conjectured on for centuries.
Ezekiels' hovering chariot has long
been theorised about - in Von
Dariker's discredited books it was a
flying saucer, in the Bible, an agent
of God. The refusal of governments
to investigate the phenomena to any
great degree has led to allegations of
a cover-up campaign - that aliens
have visited but that the evidence
has been destroyed or hidden.
The Carter administration was
embarrassed when, after promising
to release the Blue Book files, found
that many of them had been lost.
Project Blue Book was a USAF file
kept on UFO's which largely
established natural causes for
UFO's, but left a few sightings
unanswered.
The first UFO's to be sighted and
not to be attributed to enemy
aircraft were soon after the
drppping of the A-bomb on
Hiroshima - just as mysterious
disappearances in the Bermuda
Triangle were rising to a new
popularity. For a long time, flying
saucers, the Bermuda and Devil's
Triangle (in the China Sea) were
connected in the popular
imagination as being part of a plot
by extraterrestrials to study
humanity.
Over the years, the UFO story has
done more to show what people are
prepared to believe in if they want
to, than to indicate if technological
races other than humanity exist. The
most frequent sightings occur in
North America and likewise the
most fervent belief in the theory that
UFO's really are messages from
other worlds. This may be linked to
a recent survey of students in
American universities reported in
the Times December 6th which
stated that an alarming number of
students believed unequivocally in
Genesis and the existence of
paranormal phenomena.
While it might seem unfair to link
belief in a God with belief in visiting
e x t r a t e r r e s t r i a l s , the two
philosophies have remarkably
similar properties. Few UFO buffs
would disagree with the hypothesis
that extraterrestrials are benevolent
and only too willing to help
mankind - a feeling shared by people
like Carl Sagan and Dr Alan Hynek.
More fanatical believers are of the
opinion that these aliens have a
mission to save humanity from
itself. Here Christian style religions
seem to have left their mark, with a
fervent belief in "original sin" and
the inability of mankind to avoid
self-destruction. Many of these
theories seem to share similarities
with C.S. Lewis' book Out of the
Silent Planet, where Earth's
supposed twin Venus is an unfallen
Eden inhabited by angelic beings,
right down to the frequent story that
Jesus was a Venusian astronaut.
Stories of "close encounters of the
third kind" - where alien beings
contact humans personally - often
show similar patterns as well as a
singular lack of imagination. The
extraterrestrials are almost always
humanised, frequently "spindly,
shimmering beings of unearthly
beauty", that kidnap humans either
to study them, or to give them
messages to relay and are then
returned. The two most famous
occurences of this are those of a man
who called himself simply "David"
and the "cosmic" jazz musician Sun
Ra. "David" returned as a prophet
of salvation by the aliens wearing
their symbol - a fylfot. The fylfot is
quite a terrestrial symbol of good
luck, used for over two thousand
years in Indo-European cultures (it
is the mirror image of the swastika -
a familiar black magic symbol). Sun
Ra claimed that he had been
"transported into space on an
energy beam", where he was
"transformed into a member of the
Angel race and given a mission on
Earth - to make space music."
All of the evidence for flying
saucers so far is circumstantial
although quite serious attempts
have been made to find evidence of
intelligent extraterrestrial life. In the
mid-60's a series of radio-sources
were discovered that transmitted
regular pulses of radiation on a
micro-second scale. They were at
first attributed to intelligent life, but
quickly found to be caused by
rapidly spinning, ultradense
neutron stars which act like massive
lighthouses. In 1960 Project Ozma
was undertaken to search for signals
of life in space, as well as the
suggestion that a permanent array
of one hundred antenae be used for
this purpose â€” called Project
Cyclops. This is a yet unrealised
project despite extensive lobbying
by people such as Carl Sagan, a keen
exponent of communication with
other races. Sagan believes that a
race capable of interstellar
communication and even travel
must have overcome problems of
self-annihilation and could even
offer advice. The fact that we seem
