JCR
The JCR issue has been major
discussion topic between Union
representatives and College for
several weeks, but it was not until
yesterday that the matter was
discussed at any length in a UGM.
Yet the plans for the JCR are
significant ones for ICU, andfor all
IC students. It may well be that the
majority of students would prefer to
see the QT snack bar continue
providingfastfood in the JCR, rather
than a better dealfor ICU from the
Sherfield organisation. A survey and
next week's EGM will decide. Iknow
that the Exec must find it
discouraging to have their arguments
rejected at College Committees, but
at the same time it is responsibly to
ensure that they report fully to the
student body. Many of those present
yesterday clearly knew only a
fraction of the JCR story until
Jackie's timely "Does anybody
care?" prompted a reasonable
discussion session. It is easy for
students to be almost oblivious of
what even a diligent Exec are doing.
Dream Ticket
This week, as last, FELIX has printed
a selection of letters concerning the
ICU Council story which we ran in
the Christmas issue. As far as it is
possible we try to ensure that the news
coverage is unbiased and objective;
there are those who say this makes
FELIX rather dull, and that it is, after
all, only a student rag. Need we
therefore be so contentious when
writing news? I am pleased that so
many correspondents argue that the
news should befair and accurate, but
the flood of letters has been
something of an over-reaction. It is
only possible to report events as you
see them, and peoples' impressions
will also vary, particularly in
emotional situations. Too much of
what we have received has been
penned by people who write before
they think, andhas only been included
because I welcome criticism of
FELIX. I am not going to allow
another marathon exchange of
letters, however, or let the paper be
used as a publicity vehicle for
sabbatical candidates, real or
imaginary. No further corresp-
ondence on this subject will be
printed.

Tory Wet During Big Freeze
Mr Jim Prior MP addressed a group
of about 100 students on the
"Economic facts of life" on Tuesday
of this week. Mr Prior, who is at the
end of a political career which
includes Secretary of State for
Employment and Minister for
Northern Ireland in the Thatcher
and Heath governments, made a
speech most notable for not toeing
the party line. He criticised both
major political parties, and the
current system of government based
on confrontation, adding that
Britain's problems could not be
solved by the policies of either the
left or the right.
Mr Prior is currently trying to
improve the British manufacturing
industry, both in his role as
Chairman of the GEC and as a
member of parliament. He said that
Britain must accept changes in the
running of Parliament, in order to
seek a greater degree of agreement
between political parties, and thus
avoiding the damaging changes
caused by changing governments.

He is also keen to encourage more
industrialists to become involved in
Government.
After speaking for half an hour
Mr. Prior answered questions from
the audience. The event was
organised by the Conservative
Society.
The Greatest
Scoop Ever
Asbestos was removed from the
Computing Department and shed
near the old Chemistry building
over the Christmas holidays. Mr
David Price, of the College Safety
Section, described the removal as
"normal". There is a large amount
of asbestos even in the more modern
College buildings, although no
more has been added since the EEC
directive made imports illegal. The
asbestos is removed only when it
becomes a health hazard, since to
remove it all at once would cost the
equivalent of a whole department's
funding, he explained.
The Health and Safety Executive
and the Factories Inspectorate are
notified in regard to all asbestos
removal and about one in four jobs
are inspected. Removing asbestos is
a very time consuming and detailed
operation, said Mr Price, describing
the procedure which involves
sealing the area in a plastic sheeting
tent and lowering the pressure inside
the tent to ensure no asbestos fibres
escape. There are no asbestos
removals being carried out at
present.
