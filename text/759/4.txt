FELIX. FELIX, Friday January 16th 1987
Article
Amended
Dear Dave,
I wonder who changed the title of
my article and added the short
introduction to it in the Xmas issue
of Felix without my knowing or
approving these changes.
If it is the author of the C.U.
article on p. 24 of the same issue,
may I note the following:
a) May article carried my
signature and the heading
"Opinion" simply because it was
(before the addition) my opinion.
Just in case some Christians (like
myself) disagree with some of the
views expressed in the C.U. article
mentioned above (e.g. that the
gospels are "historical biography"),
could the author please sign his
work in the future so that it is clear
that he also expresses his personal
views?
b) In the added introduction the
use of the word "pacifist" is wrong.
c) I realise that all parties involved
in what I write about here have
acted out of the best of motives. It is
not my intention to cause bad
feelings or disqualify their work in
any way whatsoever.
Yours sincerely,
Michael Moutoussis

Editor's Note
The opinion article which Mr
Moutoussis wrote was printed exactly
as it was delivered to FELIX, via a
member of the Christian Union. It
was submitted with a number ofother
articlesfrom the CU, not all of which
were used in the Christmas FELIX. It
is FELIX policy not to edit or amend
any opinion article or letter without
the permission of the author; this is
normally requested only if there is a
shortage of space and an over-long
article needs to be cut. The only
exception is that FELIX reserves the
right to select the titlefor any article;
the title under which this opinion
appeared was not altered in any
significant manner from the one
suggested.

What is a university for?
Most of us came to Imperial
College expecting to learn
something. Some of us even
expected to be taught, as well as
having the opportunity to find out
for ourselves. Disillusionment came
quickly sometimes, "Imperial is
really a research establishment" is
one of the phrases I've heard most
often whilst talking to undergrad-
uates in all departments -
"academics promoted on the basis
of papers published, irrespective of
their teaching abilities".
Well it seems at last that teaching
performance is to be taken seriously
in considering lecturers for
promotion. In a time of falling
applications when undergraduate
quotas still need to be filled, a
college like Imperial can't afford to
base its reputation purely on
research. Academic staff need to be
"good value all round"—even
though the winning of lucrative
research contracts becomes even
more important.
The College has made a firm
commitment to Taking Teaching
into Account....to this end, a
sub—group of the College's
Undergraduate Studies Committee
—is trying to establish a College-
wide system of teaching evaluation.
Part of this evaluation will be based
on a standard questionnaire for all
undergraduates to fill in about all
their lecturers; this questionnaire
will be having a 'pilot run' in some
departments soon.If you're in one of
the years chosen to take part take
some time over it as it's got to be one
of the most positive steps towards
taking teaching seriously at this
College—a small step maybe, but
it's a start. Should the scheme be
extended to taught MSc students?
Should PhD students have the
chance to comment formally about
their supervisors?
Power Politics and Intrigue
Council, the "managing body" of
IC Union, meets next Monday, 19th
January, at 6.15pm in the Union
Senior Common Room. Any IC
students who's interested in how
Council works/how boring it really
is/how the hopeful sabbatical
candidates REALLY perform in all
those committe meetings is more
than welcome to attend. You can
EVEN ask for speaking rights if you
can no longer restrain your
excitement and feel you H A V E to
join in. Maybe we'll see you there.
By the way, hardly anyone has
come to see me about becoming
next year's president (A very
interesting sentence-is the President
trying to tell us something?-Ed).
What, does this mean you don't
trust me??
Love you all
Christine
