FilmSoc
IC Fim Society's next presentation,
this coming Thursday the 22nd in
Physics LT1 (doors 6.30pm) is
Weird Science (15)
Weird Science is a hilariously
funny comedy about Gary and
Wyatt; two nice, well-brought-up.
but slightly nerdy kids. The only
trouble is, not one girl in their entire
school will look at either of them. In
desperation they make their own
girl on Wyatt's computer. Not a
picture of a girl on the VDU,
understand, a real girl. The film
stars Kelly LeBrock (from The
Woman In Red) who portrays "the
perfect woman"
The following Thursday's film,
again in Physic LT1 in the evening is
Beverly Hills Cop, starring Eddie
Murphy, a brilliant comedy—
melodrama with farcical elements
and a lively music score.
Also coming this term are two of
the best films of 86: Jagged Edge
starring Jeff Bridges and Glen
Close, and John Hustons Prizzis
Honour with Jack Nicholson and
Kathleen Turner.
See posters for further details of
Film Society's presentations—and
please do come along—its a
inexpensive, very enjoyable evening
out.
Chinese
Chess
Go and Hsiangchi are vastly
different strategy games for two
players. They were both invented
several thousand years ago in the
Far East and while Go has survived
virtually unchanged from its
original form, Hsiangchi has
undergone many changes down the
ages and is the forerunner of
modern 'western' chess. It is still
widely played in the Far East, and
western chess players will notice
immediately the similarities between
eastern and western versions.
While Hsiangchi spread to the
West to evolve into western chess,
Go did not spread, and while it is
now arguably the foremost board
game in Japan and China, few
westerners have heard of Go. This is
a pity because, for the people who
play it, it is easily the greatest board
game in the world. (Hsiangchi and
chess players may disagree!). I will
spare you technical details except to
say that Go takes about five minutes
to learn, Hsiangchi a little longer,
and both take anything over an hour
to play.
The Chinese Chess Society exists
to promote both of these games and
meetings are held during Tuesday
and Wednesday lunchtimes in
Maths 341 from 12.40. Beginners
are most welcome: we have many
FilmSoc presents 'Jagged Edge' starring Jeff Bridges and Glen
Close, the psychological-mystery-thriller
competent players of both games
and full instruction is given to new
members.
So, if you're fed up with being fed
up at lunchtime come along and be
interested instead. See you there.

Hockey
Mixed Hockey
Sunday 11th January
RSM 2IC 1
It was on a cold winter's morning
that the two College mixed hockey
teams met for what had been billed
by some as a crunch match. The
pitch at Harlington was frozen
solid, as were many of the players,
with snow falling throughout much
of the game.
The first half was fairly even, both
sides having scoring chances. At
half time, however, the IC team led
by one goal scored by their dynamic
striker, Richard Ellis.
The second half saw that RSM
had by no means given up. Several
breaks into the IC goal area finally
resulted in the equaliser scored by
Mark Rayfield. The second goal
came from a penalty taken by
Simon Otto, following an incident
in which Andy Lewis was brought
down by IC's goalkeeper.
