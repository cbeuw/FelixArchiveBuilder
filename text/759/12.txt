Upstairs, Downstairs
Residents in Southside have signed a
petition expressing opposition to the
proposed introduction of staircase
kitchens in the hall. Instead, Tizard
& Selkirk residents are pressing the
College to build an extra gallery
level kitchen in the space formally
occupied by the laundry, and they
propose that the staircase fridges be
replaced by individual fridges in
each room. The petition, which has
been signed by almost all of the
Tizard residents is due to be
presented to the Students Residence
Committee when they meet to
discuss the matter next week.
The Wardens' Sub-committee
endorsed the plans for gallery level
kitchens at a meeting on
Wednesday, when it was decided
that individual fridges could be paid
for by increasing the weekly rent by
50p per week.
The Managing Surveyor of
Residences, Mr Peter Hallworth, is
understood to be in favour of
staircase kitchens and has listed a
number of objections to individual
fridges. In a report assessing the
costs of three proposals to rehouse
the staircase fridges — a move
which is necessary to comply with
fire regulations — Mr Hallworth
points out that individual fridges
would be costly to maintain, would
encourage students to cook in
rooms, and would present a pest
hazard. The report estimates the
costs of providing individual fridges
as £60,000 and rehousing the fridges
in cupboards on the staircase as
£32,000, and installing kitchens in
gallery level as £33,300.
The provision of new kitchens in
Tizard and Selkirk was first
discussed by the SRC last year when
it was decided that gallery level
kitchens should be built. Work on
the kitchens did not go ahead,
according to Mr Hallworth, because
the problem of where to relocate the
staircase fridges had not been
resolved, and because of alleged
obstruction by Southside Warden
Dr Hutchinson.
Informal meetings between the
wardens and College Deputy
Secretary Mr Brian Lloyd Davies
were held during the Christmas
break. It was decided, in the light of
Peter Hallworth's objections to
gallery level kitchens, that the SRC
should consider the issue, taking the
costs of alternative proposals into
account.
A spokesman from the Tizard
Hall Committee said he was
disappointed with the lack of
progress made in refurbishing the
kitchens and said that it was
unfortunate that the issue had to be
referred back to the SRC.
Grant
Inadequate
The All-party Education Select
Committee has accused the
Department of Education and
Science (DES) of misleading parents
over the adequacy of the student
grant. The Committee also
unanimously criticised the
Department's failure to collect
evidence and keep statistics on
students' financial needs.
The Committee's report, which
was presented to Parliament on
Tuesday, supported the principle of
full grants for almost all students,
but acknowledged that the cost of £3
million would be impossible to
meet.
The DES admits that the present
cost of living calculations are
"entirely national" and the report
proposes that a "student cost of
living index" be set up. Middle class
families would also be assessed
more generously if the report's
suggestions are accepted
The report has been favourably
received by the NUS and the Labour
Party, which described it as "a sharp
rebuke to the government over its
policy on student grants".
In The Pits
Dave Colley announced at
yesterday's U G M that, considering
A A recommendations, the Union
van fleet would be off the road for
the duration of the bad weather.
Rose Atkins joined the FELIX staff as the new Phototypesetter Operator on
Monday. Rose, who lives in Mitcham, is looking forward to operating the brand
new Compugraphic Typesetter.
IC Tomb Horror
Three Imperial College students
were found dead from hypothermia
this week. The three, who all lived in
the same flat in Lexham Gardens,
were found huddled together for
warmth in their sub-zero unheated
flat, with their feet poked inside the
kitchen oven. Students Union
know-alls, Ian Howgate and Alan
Rose, commented "this is an
absolutely disgusting state of
affairs", and we are going to further
our sabbatical election campaigns
by criticising whatever Christine
does about it".
Conditions in the 25 Lexham
Gardens flats have always been
described as "chilly", but the latest
arctic weather has prompted calls
for issuing free thermal
combinations to all tenants. This is a
little late for the three victims, and
for the students in flat six, who are
believed to be suffering frostbite in
several places. Student services are
advertising the empty flat later this
week.
AIDS Leaflet
The Government's AIDS leaflets
have been distributed to Falmouth
Keogh Hall this week. Lesley
G i l l i n g h a m , the S t u d e n t
Accommodation Officer, cont-
inuing her role as Welfare Adviser,
said that the leaflets were a good
idea and added that plans to leaflet
other residences were under
consideration.
TV Fees
Increase
The membership fees for Imperial
College Radio and STOIC will be
increased to £4, it was decided at
Tuesday's Union Finance
Committee. Union Deputy
President, Jackie Peirce, said that
the £1.50 increase was necessary to
pay for the high cost of the
equipment used by both of the
clubs. She added that, because
neither STOIC and IC Radio were
essential services, it was reasonable
for students to help finance the
equipment.
IC Radio Station Manager, Pete
Hands, described the move as "very
sad" and pointed out that students
would be discouraged from joining
IC Radio as a result.
New Places
The College is negotiating to buy
a 200 place hall of residence in the
locality. The hall will be financed in
part by the letting of rooms in
Evelyn Gardens, Beit Hall and
Garden Hall during the Easter
holidays — a move which is
expected to raise an extra £25,000
per year.
Fire regulations dictate that the
residences cannot be let to the
general public, and it is anticipated
that the facilities will mainly be used
by visiting foreign students.
In previous years the halls have
been let out only in summer, under
the control of the Student Manager.
The College is now considering
delegating the scheme to the
Conference Office in order to
prevent the incidents of student
rowdiness which resulted in damage
to halls last summer.
