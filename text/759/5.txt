Felix FELIX, Friday January 16th 1987 5
UGM
sketch
The first Union General Meeting
of 1987 saw another disappointing
turnout, much to the shagrin of Hon
Sec Dave Colley. Dave was slightly
over-optimistic in his estimation of
attendance after last week's FELIX
faux pas advertising FREE beer at
the meeting. He asked College to set
out 200 extra chairs in order to seat
the hoards in addition to the 288
fixed chairs. Obviously nobody
reads FELIX because less than 100
managed to make it. Where were the
thousands? Quite obviously stuck in
a snow drift somewhere, or eating
QT burgers.
President Christine Taig reported
on her long talks with Assistant
College Secretary, Michael Arthur,
her long talks with the Rector, and
her long talks with just about
everybody else who is anybody. She
also hinted at more rent rises if 200
places are taken on in Evelyn
Where were all the
thousands?
Gardens. Talking of the "amazing
opportunity" of gaining more basic
accommodation, she proclaimed
that she had a "gut feeling that it
was worth the subsidy" and that
"we should go for it".
After Christine's question and
answer session, the meeting was
graced by an exhibition of modern
technology when Mines President
Rob Perry's personal portable
telephone rang with a call for ex-
External Affairs Officer, Mark
It's for you-oo. . . MC phone home
Cottle (successor was elected later
on in the meeting with his best mate
and drinking buddy, Adrian 'Jelly'
Johnson winning by a narrow
margin).
This interlude was short-lived and
voices were raised during Deputy
President Jackie Peirce's report to
the meeting. Eric the Rector sent a
letter to all Heads of Departments
saying that the decision to alter the
JCR has been passed despite the
Union's protestations. This has
upset Ms Peirce after the long
wranglings over the ownership of
the QT Burger Bar and its
encroachment into Union Space.
Jackie threw the debate open to the
floor with "does anybody really care
about the JCR and QT?" The
discussion was polarised between
the militants who wanted to take
over QT (and even the entire College
Refectory system) and those who
didn't seem to care about the loss of
Union revenue describing Union
moves as "sour grapes" because QT
was making so much money. The
debate rages on after a motion
proposed by Steve Mercer to hold
an emergency general meeting in the
JCR one lunchtime was passed. It is
reckoned generally that this meeting
will surely be quorate even if half the
people are only there to eat QT
burgers. By this time the meeting
became well bogged down by
procedure. RCS President Simon
Singh proposed that an opinion poll
should be carried out by the
Executive to discover the general
concensus of the student body about
the JCR, and whether a week-long
boycott would be supported. More
amendments were proposed which
were defeated but the final notion
was passed leaving everybody
unsure of what was actually going to
happen.
During Hon Sec Dave Colley's
report the old chestnut of Linstead
Locks was raised again with College
inertia being blamed for the gap of
two years between the master key
being stolen and the locks finally
being changed. Welfare Officer,
Tom Melliar-Smith, cynically
proclaimed that College were only
prepared to change the locks after
belongings were stolen from guests
of the Summer Accommodation
Centre. Estimations of when this
will be occuring ranged from the
official line of "within a month" to
Tom's guess at by the Summer
Term.
The guest speaker, Lynda
O'Leary from ULU, gained cat-calls
from her audience but very little
verbal support for her calls for
physical campaigning against U L U
cuts of 50%. The most favorable
suggestion was that of ULU's
postcard campaign — "basically
signing lots of postcards and
dumping them on the Chairman's
doorstep". She also suggested a
library work-in: "you don't actually
have to do any work. Just say that
you're occupying it because you like
libraries".
After the U L U motion was
"does anybody really
care?"
passed and the election had taken
place, local hero Simon Bosher
proposed holding a 24 hour work-
in, as suggested by the Rector this
time last year, to a large amount of
general derision from the rest of the
50 or so people left in the hall at
2.25pm. It was of course worth
laying a bet on the fact that John
Ranson would once again call
"quorum" when it reached a Bosher
motion. Simon has to be almost as
popular as a QT burger!
Perusing the beverages on offer at
the Annual Piestazenyoot Beer
Festival Mobius (the infamous
puzzle solver) and I spotted an
attractive offer:
WIN A BARREL OF BEER
There was already quite a crowd
gathered around the table, but we
managed to find out the following:
in front of the barrel were two
measures, one offivepints and one
of three pints and the challenge was,
using the two measures and the
barrel as your only implements, to
transfer beer around so as to end up
with just one pint in each of the
measures (pouring beer away was
allowed). Various people had failed
dismally and their beer was poured
back into the barrel so that the next
person could try. It's a bit of a con,
because to solve the problem you
have to use a trick nobody in their
right mind would consider, but if
you can gather up a group of thirsty
people I reckon we can get round it!
Mobius managed to solve the
problem, although we didn't take
the barrel home with us, how did he
do it?

Pyramids
No-one has yet entered a correct
solution to Pyramid Problems, last
week's problem. Some of the
solutions have involved a page full
of algebra, this is not what I meant
by "a simple argument". The
answer I want can essentially be
acheived without any algebra at all.
As a clue I'll say that you have to
consider several pyramids of each
type and how they might fit
together. Answers by next
Wednesday 1.00pm, please, for the
£5 prize.
