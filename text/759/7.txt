to be intending to do the same thing
and that we have not overcome our
problems would appear to give the
lie to this.
Meanwhile earthbound sightings
of UFO's reported to be of "flying
saucers" have largely been
attributed to other, natural causes,
or to human error. Recent research
has suggested that eyewitness
accounts, once the backbone of the
modern judicial system are so
unreliable as to be damaging. It has
been shown that the things that
people believe they see are due to
preconceived opinions more than to
the reality - even to the extent that
they think they have been mugged
by a black person simply due to
newspaper reports that most
muggers are black, simply because
there was insufficient time to see the
attackers property. Likewise, when
it comes to UFO sightings, similar
preconceived notions colour the
events recalled. Frequently the
testimonies of airline pilots and
fighter pilots are invited as "expert"
witnesses, when in reality the reverse
is true. Pilots are trained to
recognise other aircraft since their
lives may depend on it, and accounts
of strange objects with windows are
often due to a combination of poor
seeing conditions and conditioning.
The most famous occurence of
this was in 1973 in an episode known
as the Coyne Incident where a
helicopter pilot was chased by a
UFO, which caused panic striken
pilot Lieutenant Larry Coyne to put
the craft into a steep dive. The UFO
stopped overhead, bathed the crew
in a green light and sped off to the
west, changing colour as it went.
Instruments malfunctioned, the
radio died, the craft was trapped in
"an antigravity vortex" and rose
thousands of metres into the sky
before it could be brought under
control. At first it seemed to be hard
evidence for the flying saucer
theory, but closer examination
showed that much of the episode
was due to panic and instinct rather
than advanced alien technology.
The radio malfunction was found
to be due to low altitude blocking
out signals, the green glow simply
due to the green antiglare strip along
the top of the helicopter windshield,
and the sudden rise due to
instinctive pulling back on the stick
— an act frequently performed by
experienced pilots. The UFO was
probably an Orionid meteor.
Sightings are frequently due to
atmospheric effects as well as
meteor showers. Many of the
sightings which involve lights in the
sky performing exotic manoevres
can frequently be put down to
inversions. This is an effect caused
by warm air layers coming into
contact with cold air layers. At the
interface a mirror like surface forms
due to sudden changes in density,
due to the changes in refraction and
reflection properties. The UFO's
encountered are merely the
reflections of car headlamps in the
sky - this giving rise to sudden
course changes as they go round
corners, a phenomena often
reported.

The other major sightings, those
of "flying saucers" can often be
attributed to hoaxes and more
rarely odd cloud formations. It is
possible that the clouds may have
inspired the saucer idea - as well as
early science fiction movies such as
The Day The Earth Stood Still and
Forbidden Planet - an idea that has
become so prevalent that few other
shapes are ever reported. It may also
be due to the fact that hubcaps and
frisbees do fly exceedingly well,
whereas breeze-blocks do not.
The case for extraterrestrials is
not helped by the hoaxes purported
by even some of the most senior
UFOlogists in their attempt to have
their case taken seriously.
In an attempt to have the United
Nations take a look at the UFO
story, the tiny island republic of
Grenada (before its invasion by
America), led by its self-styled
"mystic" prime minister Sir Eric
Gairy, requested a meeting with
Secretary General Kurt Waldheim.
In doing so, Gairy invited several
prominent UFOlogists to attend,
and was billed as being "the most
important meeting in the history of
UFOology." However it was merely
a courtesy extended to any member
state. The overall effect was not
helped by the hoax organised by on
Charlotte Blob of the UFOEC
(UFO Education Centre) which
related the story of an eminent
Mexican Physician who treated an
alien being after a saucer landed
near a Mexican village. The
"eminent physician" turned out to
be none other than Charlotte Blob's
husband.
It has been c o m p u t e r
enhancement that has provided the
last nail in the coffin of
photographic UFO evidence in
many cases. Many have been
discovered to be double exposures,
saucers hanging by strings or simply
out of scale pictures. The same
technique has been used to discredit
many photos purported to be of the
Lock Ness Monster. Ironically it
also provided the famous picture of
a diamond shaped fin from a
meaningless blob, fuelling more
controversy.
Whilst it seems that extra-
terrestrials have yet to arrive, the
UFO saga has done much to show
what people are prepared to believe
in if they want to. The desire for an
end to famine and global war makes
an alien race saving us from
ourselves very attractive. It also
removed the need to make any
conscious decisions to alleviate
these problems, hoping that Big
Brother will sort us out. That in
itself is a far more worrying fact
than any belief in little green men.
