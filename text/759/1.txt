The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949
ICU In Sudden
Action Shock
The Union will be holding an
Emergency General Meeting to
discuss the future of the JCR, next
Friday. The meeting, which will take
place at 12.30pm in the JCR, has been
convened to gauge student opinion on
a boycott of the QT snack bar.
The Union are unhappy about the
College's decision to backtrack on
its plans to swap the JCR with the
Sherfield Refectory — a move which
took place in the light of an
unexpected increase in the number
of students using refectories. They
are particularly concerned that
College has not taken the Union's
viewpoint seriously, and that
requests for compensation for the
loss of space in the JCR have been
ignored. It is now unlikely that
students will be allowed to use the
SCR given the staffs opposition to
the conversion of the SCR into a
refectory.
A boycott is likely to have a
serious effect on the refectory
income; currently the snack bar has
a turnover of £1700 per day, with
weekly staff costs of £1200. Union
Deputy President, Jackie Peirce
believes that a boycott would give
the Union leverage to claim greater
control of the JCR bar. "Unless we
kick them where it hurts — in the
wallet — the College will continue
to ignore us," she said.
Following an open meeting last
term, the Rector, Professor Eric Ash
has suggested that the Senior
Common Room should not be
converted into a refectory for
students and staff, as had been
proposed. In a letter delivered to the
heads of department Professor Ash
said that salads should be served in
the SCR for staff only, and added,
"We will not introduce grills and
with them the possibility of students
joining us." Instead the Rector
proposes that grills be served from
the Sherfield Refectory.
In addition the Rector has
suggested that the staff make use of
common rooms in the departments.
An 'SCR Coffee Club' would be
created to encourage academics to
tour the coffee rooms and to
promote social intercourse.
The Academic Staff Assembly is
currently draughting a questionn-
aire to gauge the opinions of the
academic staff on the SCR problem.
ICU To Defend ULU
Imperial College Union is to
support the U L U day of action on
January 27th. A motion in support
of the day of action was proposed by
Mark Harman, ICCND Chair, and
unanimously accepted.
Speaking at the U G M , U L U Vice
President (Services) Linda O'Leary
said that the University Grants
Committee wrote to the University
of London last May to inform them
of the proposed cuts. The cuts will
affect the Central University
facilities, of which Ms Leary singled
out ULU and the library as some of
the most important services that
would be cut, although the
allocation of the cuts has not yet
been made clear by Senate House
Although I C U has many
facilities, those at ULU are also used
by many IC students. Ms O'Leary
outlined the U L U campaign, noting
that 15% of IC students had signed
the petition against the cuts, and
told those present about the
postcard campaign that is being
mounted against against the UGC.
A motion has been passed through
Senate, objecting to the cuts, and the
day of action is being held the day
before the matter is raised at court.
ICU President Christine Taig,
reported that the College Unions
would support the students' action
and it was agreed that the Exec
should investigate ways of
protesting.

front page •
South Africa
Talk
A representative from the South
African Embassy will present a talk
entitled "South Africa The Future"
for the Conservative Society on
Tuesday. The talk, which will take
place in room 139 of the Huxley
Building, is expected to attract
protests and demonstrations from
ULU, Socialist Society, and Anti
Apartheid Society.
Consoc Chairman, Qavid
Burbage said that Con Soc's aim
was to provide a platform to enable
students to hear the South African
Government's point of view. "We
don't necessarily agree or condone
his point of view" he explained.
iC Union has refused to ensure
the safety of the representative and
the Executive are understood to be
unhappy about the apparent secrecy
which has surrounded the visit.
Union President Christine Taig told
FELIX "I wash my hands of
anything that might happen" and
pointed out that the Union is not
obliged to look after the
representative, as the meeting is
being held in College, not Union
premises.
