The idea of 'technology running
amok' has become popular recently
with films like Wargames and Blue
Thunder, both directed by John
Badham. He contrives the theme in
his latest film, Short Circuit, which
concerns the world of robotic
armaments. Unfortunately, where
his previous films have had a certain
amount of technical credibility,
Short Circuit is far less convincing,
although admittedly less serious.
'Number Five' is an artificially
intelligent weapons system, a robot
Rambo, which, after being struck by
lightning, escapes it's secret testing
ground and decides it would rather
pick flowers and look at butterflies
than zap people with its built-in
laser. To this end it is befriended by
Stephanie Speck, a "cute all-
American single girl" and animal
lover, who becomes convinced that
the robot is 'alive'. Meanwhile it is
being tracked down by its inventor,
Newton Crosby, and a gang of
bungling security men. After the
compulsory sequences of chases and
laser battles Stephanie manages to
persuade Newton Crosby that
Number Five really is 'alive' and
together they try and save it from
being 'disassembled'.
If you're prepared to put up with
the rather predictable plot,
stereotyped characters, and a
horrendously cute robot (metalic
ET), then Short Circuit is quite good
fun, making up for what it lacks in
other areas with a witty script and
fast pace. It is one of those films
where you just know who's going to
live happily ever after with who.
Ally Sheedy as
Stephanie
Do you remember going to
pantomimes when you were little?
There was something for everyone.
Your Dad could ogle at the
principal boy, your Mum could go
out because you weren't around or
she could laugh at the comedians,
you could shout and sing along with
the actors. The Golden Child is a
sort of pantomime film. There's
special effects and a child hero to
appeal to the younger audience.
There's Eddie Murphy to appeal to
the teenagers. There's a beautiful
woman who gets covered in water
(the wet T-shirt look) for the dirty
old men. There's a love story.
Unfortunately this cocktail of
everything doesn't work. The
Golden Child is not up to the
standard of previous Eddie Murphy
films (even 'Best Defence').
The Golden Child is meant to be
funny, but apart from one five
minute scene, it drags. The problem
is that Eddie Murphy is at his best
when be is wisecracking and in this
film he is rarely given the chance to
wisecrack. He spends most of his
time on a fairly boring trail chasing
after a child. He is faced by a variety
of supernatural enemies. The film is
basically a poor adventure movie.
The special effects are quite good
but are so infrequent that they don't
really make the film special. The
story line is boring.
The Golden Child will probably
be a huge box office success. People
go and see Eddie Murphy whatever
the reviews say. Most people who go
will, I believe, be disapointed. The
film has got the ingredients of a
good film, it just hasn't mixed them
properly.
Hugh Southey
Karen Silkwood was a socially
outcast power worker who
uncovered faults at her plant that
were being ignored by the company.
She was murdered whilst travelling
to meet a reporter from 'The New
York Times' and the evidence that
she had with her disappeared. Her
story was filmed as "Silkwood", one
of the most powerful and
controversial films of the 80's.
The team that produced
"Silkwood" reformed to make
"Heartburn". This time Meryl
Streep plays a cookery writer who,
against her better judgement
marries playboy Jack Nicholson,
and for a while they live in bliss, but
their marriage quickly falls apart.
Director Mike Nichols seems
unable to decide whether to treat the
story as a yuppie tear-jerker or a
satire. Nora Ephorn's script is based
upon her own marriage and
consequently is a confused mixture
of emotions which does not make
good cinema, the unsatisfactory
ending even suggests that the whole
movie is an allegory of the childrens'
rhyme about a spider! However
"Heartburn" does have some spicey
comic moments which keep the
audience laughing along, until, at
the end, we realise how vacant and
spineless it all is.
Hollywood stars do not make
controversial films in case they lose
their audience and consequently
work. Streep, who is brilliant when
playing flawed women surviving
against all odds, now appears only
in mindless, if expensive, films that
are unworthy of her immense
dramatic skills.
It is unbelievable that the talented
group of people that made
"Silkwood" can fall to such depths.
The advertising ought to warn that
"Heartburn" is not only irritating it
can also make you sick.
Theatre: Triumph at The Gate
When I saw the excellent reviews
of "Triumph of Love" by Michael
Billington of the Guardian and
Michael Ratcliffe of the Observer it
did cross my mind to hand in their
collective opus, but instead I give
you my equally prestigious (well
almost) contribution.
If you want to see what London
Fringe Theatre is about then you
couldn't do better than to go to the
Gate Theatre in Pembridge Road,
Notting Hill Gate. This play
furthers the reputation being built
up at the Gate Theatre (they
received the Time Out Fringe
Award for best venue of 1986).
There are four reasons for this.
Firstly, you will see a British
premiere of a play frequently shown
abroad.
Secondly, the visiting Anchor and
Dolphin theatre company present
their new translation of a piece by
the much neglected (in this country)
Marivaux.
Thirdly, you'll see the contrast
between the expensive West End
theatres with their lavish but dull
and touristy productions and the
small scale professional theatre that
is prepared to put on something
new.
Fourthly, the pub downstairs is
pretty good.
The play itself is about a young
queen who finds herself falling in
love with a yound man who her own
family have mistreated. This neatly
fits in with her dislike of the injustice
done to him and so she decides to
win his love and make him king.
This sound simple enough but
unfortunately the young man is
looked after by a somewhat chaste
philosopher and the equally chaste
philosopher's sister.
Marivaux is never one to shy from
a bit of complexity and so the
philosopher and his sister find
themselves both being seduced by
the not so truthful queen. Whether
reason defeats manipulation you'll
have to find out for yourselves.
The success of the play is highly
dependent on the ability of the main
actress. Anchor and Dolphin have
found a fine actress in the form of
Harriet Keevil who deserves a
mention. She pulls this well directed
play along very skilfully. There are
also some good supporting
performances.
The play is a thoughtful comedy
which may well introduce the
audience to a commedia dell'arte
style. If you want to know the
significance of the masked character
then I refer you to the
comprehensive programme which
covers it better than I can.
All in all, this makes for an
enjoyable evening's entertainment
as both myself, several IC students
and the Guardian and Observer
critics can testify. Its certainly
professional and it'll certainly make
you laugh. I understand that
audiences are steadily growing but
you have until the 31st Jan to see it.
