t’s the night before the
final exam, but you
haven’t studied. If you
had a small white pill
which promised greater
focus and productivity
would you take it? The Tab
website conducted a survey
of 2000 UK university
students and discovered
that 1 in 5 have taken the
drug ‘Modafinil’. Many
students take it to concentrate
because they cannot cope
with the demands of their
degree. Furthermore, with an
expanding job market and
stellar CVs, many students
take Modafinil to gain an
edge over their competitors.
Modafinil is a drug that
increases wakefulness. It is
strictly prescribed to patients
suffering from ADHD, nar-
colepsy and sleep apnea,
however recently more
people, especially students
are taking them to study.
Since Modafinil is not a
controlled substance but can
be prescribed by a doctor,
possessing it is not illegal,
however selling it is. Many
students purchase these drugs
through unreliable pharma-
ceutical sources in India and
Malaysia or through other
students on campus.
Modafinil increases concen-
tration whilst studying. The
University of Oxford analysed
24 studies between 1990
and 2014 and found that
it boosted higher cognitive
function, particularly attention
and learning. It is known to
enhance serotonin, histamine
and glutamate levels which
increase an individual’s level
of alertness and short term
memory. One user needed to
draft a proposal for the Dalai
Lama Foundation but was
suffering from writer’s block,
but after taking Modafinil was
able to complete it. Online
testimonials have also high-
lighted that it induces weight
loss and enhances moods.
However, there are several
problems to Modafinil. Firstly,
it can cause side effects like
headaches, depression, and
insomnia. This smart drug can
severely disrupt sleep patterns
so that they receive less slow-
wave sleep. According to
Professor Sahakian, a leading
neuroscientist at Cambridge
University, studies have only
investigated the effects of a
single dose and so the long
term effects are unknown. It
is also not known whether
individuals may develop a
tolerance to Modafinil after
repeated use as with caffeine.
It has also been noted that in
approximately 5 cases per
million, the smart drug can
cause Steven Johnson’s syn-
drome where the individual
develops a life-threatening
rash. Furthermore, many
students have reported that
they have become heavily
dependent on Modafinil and
it has become a habit to use
it to pass their exams. On the
other hand, some students
have reported that it does not
help them study because their
focus shifts from their work to
smaller things. One university
student, for example, stated
that he ‘found [himself] focus-
ing on more menial things like
football matches rather than
work’.
Finally, although it is
reported that Modafinil
boosts focus and concentra-
tion, the learning is superficial
and the newly found knowl-
edge is not processed into
long term memory. So
although it is a quick fix
for an imminent exam, the
knowledge cannot be applied
and will not be retained in the
long term. Students should
instead find healthy study
techniques to prepare for
their exams. During times of
extreme stress, distractions
like exercise and meditation
can improve an individual’s
state of mind.
F
act: The strongest
living thing on the
planet is gonorrhea.
Neisseria gon-
orrhoeae (the
bacterium that
causes gonorrhea) is a force
to be reckoned with, given
it can pull with a force over
100,000 times its own body
weight. For a human to
compete, you’d have to shift
over ten million kilos, which
weighs in at just over 50
blue whales.
The secret to the incredible
strength of this bacterium
is its wtiny tentacle-like
structures called pili, which
are attached to a biological
motor not dissimilar from
our own muscles. These
allow the bacterium to crawl
across surfaces, but the huge
forces they can exert might
also be a way in which the
bug forces its way into our
cells when infecting humans.
Admittedly, this pow-
erhouse is a little on the
small side, weighing in at
0.000000000001 grams
(one trillionth of a gram), so
in real terms it can actually
only pull something about
50 times lighter than a grain
of sand. It could still beat
you in a fight though – some
strains of gonorrhea could
kill you in a couple of days,
and with their growing anti-
biotic resistance there might
soon be nothing your GP
can do for you.
Bro do you

Alexandra Lim explains why the Mediterranean diet may be the best there is...
T
hink back to the last
time you dipped
sourdough into
balsamic, mixed with
a gleaming pool
of olive oil. Extra
virgin, please. As the world of
nutrition science continues to
shift our perceptions between
food ideals, a new study
has come to light featuring
the sunny, olive oil lifestyle.
The paper, published in the
online journal Neurology,
has shown that those who
sustain themselves on a
Mediterranean diet retain
more brain volume than those
who don’t. There is however,
one key and slightly unusual
exception – the amount of
fish consumed, regardless
of how much other meat is
eaten, fails to make an overall
difference. This particular
finding contrasts with earlier
studies looking into health
benefits of a Mediterranean
diet. So why is it so healthy
for us, even without the fish?
Looking at it in the big
picture, the Mediterranean
diet is full of fruits, vegetables,
beans, cereal grains like
rice, and legumes, as well
as copious amounts of olive
oil. Dairy, fish and wine
(of course) are consumed
in moderate amounts, with
limited intake of red meat
and poultry. Researchers in
this study gathered data on
eating habits from almost a
thousand Scottish people, all
aged around 70, who did not
have dementia. Participants
all differed in how closely
their dietary habits followed
that of a Mediterranean
lifestyle. MRI scans showed
that those who followed
the diet more closely over
a period of three years
were less likely to lose brain
volume than those who didn’t.
In fact, dietary difference
alone explained 0.5%
difference in brain volume.
This doesn’t sound like much,
but is a significant proportion
when taking into account that
the total brain volume lost is
solely due to to the process of
ageing. And how do we know
that this difference really is
completely attributed only to
diet?
Researchers went a step
further by testing other
possible confounding factors
such as age, gender, weight,
education, high blood
pressure, or having a history
of diabetes or obesity. Results
nevertheless remained the
same. The main, unusual

Lara Bailey looks at the useful applications of marijuana
E
veryone is
familiar with the
perceived positive
and negative
connotations of
Marijuana. In 2016
alone, 51% of Americans
smoked cannabis, and its
global use is on the rise
due to recent legalisation in
several US states. However,
despite its widespread use,
surprisingly little has been
confirmed in terms of its
effects on the human body.
So far, its legal status has
hindered rigorous scientific
testing of cannabis, and stud-
ies performed so far have left
more questions than answers.
It is thought it could have
significant medical potential.
Unfortunately, any potential
medical benefits are yet to
reach the public sphere.
A new study published by
the National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering and
Medicine in Washington D.C.,
has collated all available
negative and positive impacts
of the drug. However, the
main point of the study is that
the legal status of cannabis
needs to be changed, so
that researchers can access
it easily. If it is going to be
treated as a medical drug,
then it should be tested as
one. Without more testing,
claims of cannabis being a
‘miracle cure’ are relatively
unfounded.
From over 10,000 studies,
several negative and positive
effects of the drug were
found. Use of weed can lead
to other drug addictions,
alcohol abuse, and increased
chance of developing psy-
chological problems such as
schizophrenia. Such issues
can arise with long-term and
regular use of the drug. There
is very low support in terms
of its effectiveness as a treat-
ment for epilepsy, and cancer,
despite claims. Encourag-
ingly, researchers confirmed
that it does not increase
the risk of lung, head and
neck cancers. However, the
influence of the drug on heart
issues and other cancers has
not been researched.
Positive effects include
reduction of chronic pain,
and multiple sclerosis patients
have reported increased
muscle spasms on taking
the drug. The smoke may
deter inflammation-related
infection, but data on immune
responses is lacking. Few
or no findings support its
effectiveness in treating PTSD
or Tourettes syndrome. This
is not to say that cannabis is
conclusively bad. While in
some cases the negative links
are clear, long-term studies
are needed to test other
health impacts. For example,
the impact of cannabis on
memory and attention span is
known, but there is little data
to support that use influences
unemployment or school
drop-out rate. Moreover, the
clear health benefits, such

patients, highlight the need to

It is clear that marijuana
has great potential. Cur-
rently in the UK, medical
use of cannabis in the form
of Sativex, containing two
chemicals from cannabis, can
be prescribed to MS patients.
Cannabis itself for medical
use is still illegal, and anyone
using it for medical reasons
can still be charged for pos-
session. Several MPs have
called for its legal status to be
reassessed.
takeaway was that fish or
meat consumption did not
make a significant difference
to brain health. It is important
to note, following the study,
that results could be attributed
to specific components of
the Mediterranean diet.
Perhaps it was just the regular
consumption of butter beans
or two kilos of kale per week
that did the trick.
Study author Michelle
Luciano, PhD, of the University
of Edinburgh says, “As we
age, the brain shrinks and
we lose brain cells which can
affect learning and memory.
This study adds to the body
of evidence that suggests
the Mediterranean diet has
a positive impact on brain
health.”
