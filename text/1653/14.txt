Rebooted |
A Series of
Unfortunate
Events
Saad Ahmed
Once again, Netflix rushes
into rescue and, in this case,
reboot a much loved property
thathadbeenpoorlyadapted.
So, is the series any good,
or does it become an all too
literal rendition of its title?
The catchy theme song
of this Netflix adaptation
advises you to look away,
warning you of a story that
is dark and has no happy
ending. If you actually listen
to that advice, it would be an
unfortunate event in of itself,
as you would be missing out
on a well-made, dark and
incredibly self-aware series.
A series of unfortunate
events were originally a much
beloved book series, telling
the story of the Baudelaire
orphans, Violet, Klaus and
Sunny. Right off the bat, their
parents die in a mysterious
house fire and they are thrust
into a grim and dark world,
constantly shifting between
guardians and being pursued
by the menacing Count Olaf,
who’s after their inheritance
and plans all sorts of vile
schemes to get his way.
While a previous film
adaptation with Jim Carey
was a bit more free with the
source material, this Netflix
series adapts the books very
closely. Of course it helps
massively that the real-life
writer, Daniel Handler, is
an executive producer and
the show’s writer. Roughly,
each book is divided into two
episodes, and watching two,
or even one is enough to tell
a cohesive story for those
not fans of binge watching.
Watching several together,
however, may feel a bit cyclic
at times.
The highlight of the show
is Neil Patrick Harris as the
zany and despicable Count
Olaf, who is always just about
smarter than all the other
adults so that he can conduct
his meticulous plans. Harris is
able to nail the ridiculousness
of the character, while making
sure he remains a frightening
force to be reckoned with.
The actors who play the older
Baudelaires, Weissman and
Hynes, are also terrific and
instantly likeable, able to
hold their own against their
experienced adult co-stars.
This is both literal and figu-
rative as the series portrays
the children as intelligent and
observant, as opposed to
the adults who are depicted
as dumb and corrupted by
society.
Patrick Warburton is also a
real treat as Lemony Snicket.
He opens and closes the
episodes as well as interjects
between various key scenes,
giving us a fourth wall com-
mentary, explaining certain
phrases or apologizing for
the dark nature of this tale.
His costumes and deliberately
dry delivery are amusing to
watch and add levity to the
proceedings while alloing for
fun visual transitions between
scenes.
The show never shies away
from its dark and dreary
nature; it’s about a man mali-
ciously after three orphans
after all. Count Olaf’s actions
always feel tense and creepy,
whether it’s his plan to marry
a fourteen year old girl or
even his simple action of slap-
ping a child. As weird and
expansive as it is, this series
is similar tonally to shows
like Jessica Jones or Stranger
Things, while being crazier
and wackier.
This show also really flour-
ishes on world-building and
the style really makes each
episode feel unique (almost
like they were based on
books). With a mix of practi-
cal design, CGI and beautiful
set castings, every
new location
feels unique

designed, from the messy
and decaying rooms of Count
Olaf’s mansion and the
vibrant and lively environ-
ment that is the Reptile Room.
Though at times the CGI may
falter, in some of Sunny’s
scenes for instance, there’s
always a stunning view with
an appropriate atmosphere.
There’s also a fun mix of
the contemporary and the
vintage with archaic clothing
styles and steampunk devices

It honestly does not matter if
you’ve never read any of the
books filled with Unfortunate
Events. This Netflix series is
extremely welcoming to new-
comers, opening its mystery
box of encapsulating despair
from the first episode and
layering it with performances,
writing and direction that
keep you riveted until the
end. An ongoing mystery
keeps you coming back for
more; even if you are a book
reader, there’s something new
as an intriguing new subplot
is added not seen in the
books.
At this point, any Netflix
adaptation is bound to be
good and this show is no
exception. While the plot
may get a bit repetitive, the
charming cast and lingering
mysteries are consistently
engaging and just plain fun,
for lack of a better word.
Though Lemony Snicket may
constantly protest, you’d be
doing yourself a disservice if
you don’t watch this show.

exchange between Sherlock
and John in The Lying Detec-
tive? Surely not with Molly
- the “I love you” that was so
widely publicised before the
series aired turned out to be
part of a horrifically misogy-
nistic and manipulative scene,
the emotional fallout from
which was never explored.
The Final Problem revelled in
its hollowness, watching it felt
like being trapped inside a
cardboard bunker - as indeed
Sherlock was in the last
scenes of the episode - the
walls of the world The Final
Problem created collapsed
at the slightest scrutiny. “No
loose ends, not on my watch”
proclaimed Mark Gatiss as
Mycroft Holmes in the second
episode of this series – one
could’ve drowned in the
loose ends in the episode that
followed.
If this is indeed the last
episode of Sherlock, how
will the series be judged
as a whole? The subject of
queer-baiting is likely to be
one of the most associated.

silence from Sherlock. Bene-
dict Cumberbatch delivered
a masterful performance
of a man devastated by
the marriage of the man he
loves to someone else in The
Sign of Three. The seeds of
the idea that the Sherlock
and John relationship could
develop into a romantic one
were steadily planted never
to fully flourish. Subtextually
the show referred heavily to
The Private Life of Sherlock
Holmes, a film that both
Gatiss and Moffat rate as one
of their favourite adaptations
of the original stories – Gatiss
going so far as to say to The
Guardian that the screenplay
formed a template for BBC’s
Sherlock. In Private Life,
Sherlock Holmes is depicted
as a closeted gay man des-
perately, silently in love with
John Watson, medicating with
cocaine to hide his pain and
guilt. Years after the film’s
release, director Billy Wilder
spoke of his great regret of
never making the relationship
explicit “I wanted to make
Holmes a homosexual . . .
That’s why he’s on dope, you
know.”
Wilder is a character that
appears in The Abomina-
ble Bride: the skull in 221B,
Sherlock’s junkie friend,
even Sherlock himself
(“William Sherlock Scott
Holmes- if you’re looking
for baby names”) are all
named “Billy”, and numerous
lines from “is tea code?” to
“admirably high arches”, to
the flower in John’s hair are
Private Life references. Yet all
this queer coding – nudges
at Oscar Wilde, at Private
Life, all those aborted almost
confessions – at the tarmac,
at the end of The Lying
Detective come to nothing,
or are treated as a joke. The
villains on the other hand
– from Moriarty, to Irene
Adler to Euros are explicitly
stated to be queer. Their
queerness is often associ-
ated with violence or sexual
abuse (Moriarty and Euros)
or disregarded altogether in
service of plot (Irene). Such
blatant homophobia is always
unacceptable but especially
galling from Mark Gatiss,
himself a gay man.
In an interview with Gay
Times in 2011 Gatiss spoke
of his dream of intelligently
portrayed queer representa-
tion on TV; “That’s how the
revolution happens... I think
when the day comes that you
have a big detective show…
[in which the detective goes
to work and] he’s a maverick
and all the usual things and
[when he gets home] and
his boyfriend says, “Are you
alright?”... then something
would have genuinely
changed.” On Sherlock,
Gatiss was given the chance
to stage that revolution and
it would seem he had neither
the courage nor the ingenuity
to seize it.
Moffat has long been
accused of misogynistic
writing and the accusations
follow him to Sherlock. Mary,
the unseen housewife who
dies off screen in the Conan
Doyle stories was transformed
into a character with agency
in the BBC show only to die
on screen and be periodi-
cally resurrected to help her
“Baker Street boys” along.
It was a textbook case of
‘fridging’ a female character
– an allusion heightened by
Mycroft opening an empty
fridge in the moments after
Mary’s death. Molly, a
Gatiss and Moffat original
character grew to develop
beyond her infatuation with
Sherlock through the series
only to be forced back into
that box in the final episode.
These instances only add to
the already long list of crimes
this show has perpetrated
against its female characters
throughout its run.
Real world implications
aside, in a purely narrative
sense The Final Problem
and Series 4 as a whole
set about systematically
dismantling what the previous
three seasons built up. In
an interview with
IGN in 2014 Steven Moffat
said of the show: “ it’s not a
detective show. It’s a show
about a detective. That’s why
it’s exciting.” Yet in a voice
over at the end of The Final
Problem Mary declares “it
not about who you really are,
it’s all about the legends.”
The show sacrificed character
growth at the altar of high
octane action and as a result
fell utterly flat, becoming a
parody of itself and its genre.
Indeed the final episode’s
incongruity with the show as
a whole has led some fans to
speculate on the existence of
a secret fourth episode that
is yet to air – and who can
blame them, from the first
moment of The Final Problem
to its last it feels like Moriarty
has hacked into every screen
showing Sherlock.
If this final episode really
is the end of series 4 (and
at this point it’s far from
certainty in my mind) then it
was the protracted death of
a once great show. The show
runners doubt whether they
will be able to make series 5;
if this is was the culmination
of their great plan, they don’t
deserve to. The Final Problem
got a standing ovation at the
press screening. Why, we
must ask ourselves. Perhaps,
as one incisive friend put it,
it was because it was finally,
thankfully, over.
