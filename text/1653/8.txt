f you were to rely on the
list of previous winners
of the Best Actor Oscar
as a definitive list of
cinema history’s greatest
performances, you would
probably have one clear
go-to when thinking of acting
techniques for a sure-fire win
on a grand gesture, we see
instead a slight furrowing of
the brow; pursed lips and
downward-looking eyes
appear where we would
usually expect an immense
emotional outpouring. And
yet this is no shortcoming: the
immense delicacy of every
movement, turn of phrase,
and pained facial expres-
sion (and believe me, they
are pained) adds up to a
masterclass in restraint and
subtlety in a performance
that conjures the likes of
Laurence Olivier or Marlon
Brando in his later years. It’s
a masterwork inside another
masterwork – the film itself.
Manchester by the Sea
begins as Lee Chandler
(Affleck) – a quiet, bitter,
calcified janitor in Quincy,
Massachusetts with a knack
for starting fights – receives
a phone call informing him of
the death of his brother Joe
(Kyle Chandler). He travels to
the small town of Manches-
ter-by-the-Sea to break the
news to Joe’s teenage son
Patrick (Lucas Hedges), but
learns upon examining his
brother’s will that he has been
named as Patrick’s guardian.
As fragments of the family’s
past begin to appear in
flashback, and we learn more
and more about the troubles
Lee and Joe have faced, we
understand the deep grief
that sits coiled at the heart of
this film. I’m going to avoid
details as much as possible,
but you should be warned
screen.
It’s difficult to forget the
feeling you carry after seeing
a truly great, truly sad film.
I might just be a bit of a
heartless bastard, but for me,
crying during the first viewing
of a movie is an extremely
rare occurrence – 12 Years
A Slave, The Lives of Others,
and – most recently – I,
Daniel Blake are among the
small handful of films that
have managed it. But what’s
even more rare is that pecu-
liar, gravely, sombre feeling
that lingers after moments
like the ending of Fruitvale
Station, or the point at which
Bridge To Terabithia’s plot
takes a turn (if you’ve seen
it, you know exactly what I
mean): one part quiet hope,
nine parts utter dejection.
Truth be told, I have never felt
it as strongly or for so long as
I did after I first saw Manches-
ter by the Sea. It’s one thing
to make an easy tear-jerker
of a film, but it takes an enor-
mous amount of talent to tell a
story this crushing and make
it as immensely watchable
as it is throughout, for so
many reasons. I’ve picked my
brain over and over to find a
single fault in this film since
my first viewing of it, and
I simply cannot. Lonergan
has achieved something
wholly incredible. It probably
won’t be the 2017 film that
I rewatch the most – La La
Land already has a pretty
steadfast hold on that spot –
but I will be astounded if I see
a more moving film this year.

A restrained exploration of
grief, with exceptionally strong
performances from Michelle
Williams and Casey Affleck,
Manchester by the Sea is the
most moving film of the year.
now: Manchester by the Sea
is devastating to watch.
But, surprisingly enough,
it also has more laughs in
it than any comedy I’ve
watched for a while – not
in any sort of dark comedy
sense, but rather because the
script by Kenneth Loner-
gan, who also directed, is
bristling with conversations
so naturalistic and organi-
cally funny that the slightest
of reactions or the smallest
of quips between friends hit
like the punchline to a stand-
up’s best joke. Perhaps this is
also because the characters
having these conversations
are so perfectly realised –
the film is populated by such
well-sketched people that
within an extremely short
time from meeting them they
felt like close. It even gave
me the all-too-rare treat of
having a moment to recollect,
some twenty-five minutes into
the film, how glad I was that
I had so much more time to
spend with these wonderfully
flawed people I was watching
on-screen.
There may be yet another
reason for this, however:
the all-round, across-the-
board brilliance of the
performances. This may
well be the performance of
Affleck’s career (a description
I certainly don’t use lightly
as a huge fan of his), but
he is backed up on all sides
by the supporting players:
Lucas Hedges pitches Patrick
perfectly, with just the right

understated performances \\ Allstar/StudioCanal
Manchester
by the Sea
(apart from being white):
shouting. It has seemed
throughout the years that the
only performances by leading
actors that really catch
awards committees’ attention
are the ones that go off with
a flash and a bang – nuance
and subtlety be damned. In
fact, Leonardo DiCaprio’s
landmark win last year for
his role in The Revenant saw
him in a performance that
featured more yelling and
exasperated grunting than
actual speech.
So upon hearing the amount
of Oscar buzz currently
orbiting Casey Affleck for his
performance in Manchester
by the Sea, you might be
led to believe, as I was, that
this year might end up no
different. Imagine my shock
when by the time the movie
was over I had counted just
one scene – a very short one
at that, and only about ten
minutes into the 137-minute
runtime – in which Affleck
raised his voice. Where a
different actor may have put
