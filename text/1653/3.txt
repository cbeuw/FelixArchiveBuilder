This put the Union in a difficult
position, since it had previously
adopted a policy not to
support measures that would
result in further fee increases,
and against the marketisation
of higher education: both
stated objectives of the
HERB. (Imperial was the
only university in the country
to approve of the 2011
fee tripling). Therefore,
participating in the TEF could
be seen as infringing on that
policy.
An extraordinary Union
council meeting was held on
January 10th
with the specific
purpose of discussing the
response the student body and
the Union representing them
should adopt with respect
to the upcoming Teaching
Excellence Framework (TEF).
The meeting was also
an opportunity to discuss
other government efforts to
assess the quality of higher
education, with an attempt to
introduce a motion calling for
the boycott of the NSS.
The motion was rejected
due to having been submitted
too late, but the wider theme
of student evaluations being
used to justify cost increases
hung over the assembly for the
remaining of the evening.

This seems innocuous enough,
however the introduction of
the government’s new Higher
Education and Research Bill
(currently in the Chamber
of Lords) linked the results
obtained by universities in the
TEF with new fee increases.
Fee increases would be
indexed on inflation, either
at half the inflation rate for
universities awarded a “meets
expectations” rating, or at the
full inflation rate for the other
categories.

uring this week’s
extraordinary
council meeting,
I proposed a
paper to seek
p e r m i s s i o n
from Council to approve the
following: firstly, for the Union
to make contributions to
Imperial’s Teaching Excellence
Framework (TEF) submission
and secondly, for Council to
review the Union’s existing
Higher Education Funding
policy. The paper was passed
successfully.
The argument ultimately
rested on whether the Union
should continue to be a strong
advocate for the improvement
of education at Imperial or
whether it should make a
political stance against the
TEF. Following discussion,
Council agreed that continuing
our activity around striving for
educational excellence would
be of greater benefit to our
members than making efforts
to rebel against the TEF.
Council members came
to respect that the TEF
is inevitably going to be
implemented and that some
aspects of the TEF, aside from
the inflationary fee rise, have
On the other hand, good
relations between the Union
and the College have been
key to several advances
obtained by the students
in the last few years. The
College is asking the Union to
co-write the TEF submission,
a mark of goodwill that
enables the students to have
a real say (some universities
reduced ‘student input’ to a
couple hundred words on the
submission according to ICU
President Nas Andriopoulos).
After energetic discussions,
the motion mandating the
Union to engage with College
on the TEF was finally passed
with minor amendments, in a
victory for the ICU President
and the Deputy President for
Education, Luke McCrone.
However, the subject of tuition
fees is bound to return to
the limelight sooner or later,
and the Union might have
a tougher time defining the
course of action to follow then.
to HEFCE requires institutions
to measure the impact of
their teaching, which should
encourage academics to be
more evidence-based in their
pedagogic approach. TEF
also aims to better inform
student choices when deciding
betweenuniversitiesbymaking
more information about
teaching quality available to
prospective students.
International students, which
comprise a staggering 40% of
our member population, are
not affected by the TEF since
the inflationary fee rise only
concerns home students. By
opting to rebel against the TEF,
for example by boycotting
the National Student
Survey (NSS), we would be
neglecting the educational
experience of 40% of our
members, whilst jeopardising
our NSS Response, one of
the Union’s most powerful
tools in lobbying College on
educational matters.
