lue Monday, alternatively known as the
most depressing day of the year, came and
went this week. (Blue like hands without
gloves flaunted at passing strangers on the
street. Wait what?) By now you’ve come to
terms with the fact that you probably spent
way too much money over Christmas. You’ve also
been spending a disproportionate amount of time in
bed, barricading yourself with every piece of spare
linen you can get your hands on, trying to stave off
the cold that Snowmageddon has brought. You’re also
involuntarily taking part in dry January, because you
caught a nasty bug and are on antibiotics, while at
the same time praying that it’s not some untreatable
superbug you’ve got and that dem sweet meds are
actually working.
You successfully emerged from the worst Monday
blues of the year only to be met with Theresa May, the
UK’s new iron lady, making chilling claims about the
single market, the hard Brexit and the Library Cafe.
(Wait no. I think I dreamt that last bit. I mean that
would explain how nobody seemed to care that I was
being served a jacket potato with chilli con carne and
cheese by the Iron lady in her tighty whities.)
And if you’ve made it thus far, prepare for the event
of the year (so far) – Donald Trump’s marriage to
America during the 45th
presidential inauguration in
Washington.
But wait. All is not wrong with the world. For starters
kittens and puppies are still a thing. Also looks the
Central Library will be getting some air con! And sure
you might not be getting a cool study space to revise,
despair and meltdown till at least September but if
humanity survives till then, at least the Central Library
will be cool and breezy. Though if let’s say £13m have
failed to fix the library’s thermal regulation we can’t
say we’re particularly optimistic that another £13.5m
will.
Maybe we shouldn’t be so jaded though. I mean it
was Kim Kardashian who said “Hope dies last. Unless
you’re out of lipgloss. Then there is no hope.” Or
maybe I also dreamt that.
