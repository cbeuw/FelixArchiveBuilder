Central Library to get air con Lef Apostolakis
H
appy days.
ImperialCollege
will finally be
taking steps to
solve issues with
t e m p e r a t u r e
regulation at the Central
Library. Probably.
According to a teasing
announcement from Library
Services just before Christmas,
“early indications are that a
project to improve the temper-
ature at Central Library will
begin in 2017.”
This comes after felix
launched a campaign last
summer demanding humane
studying conditions in the
Central Library, notorious for
reaching face-melting tem-
peratures, particularly during
summer term. According to
Library Services, tempera-
ture regulation has been “the
single biggest source of com-
plaint from the student body
for several years”.
This development is meant
to be the second phase of a
larger project which began in
2014 and will most likely be
taking place over this academic
year’s summer vacation period
hopefully to be completed by
autumn 2017. Phase one saw
the Central Library improve on
issues with overcrowding and
limited computer availability;
the Science Museum Library
was evicted from the third floor
and the space was turned into
a study area.
Phase two was meant to deal
with temperature regulation
and indeed there was a suc-
cessful application for Planning
Permission back in 2014, of a
ventilation plant that would
sit on the roof of Sherfield.
The plant, occupying a space
of 68 cubic meters, would be
connected to the library by
internally built ductwork.
Unfortunately the works,
reportedly projected to cost
an estimated £13.5m, had
been put on ice, as only half
the funding necessary had
been secured. It appears
though that the felix petition,
which gathered 13,000 sig-
natures (just under 10% of
the student body), along with
pressure from the Union and
some NSS-induced panic
have convinced College to
go through with the plans.
Despite the hype, it has been
stressed to us that nothing is
set in stone and there are still
many sign-offs the proposed
project needs to pass before
promises are made and plans
are finalised. This is perhaps
why all announcements so far
have been rather non-com-
mittal and Library Services,
unable to contain their excite-
ment, went rogue and spilled
the beans.
However, the Library service
recently made public a prelim-
inary timetable of the works,
bringing dreams of a well ven-
tilated library one step closer
to realisation.
According to the timetable
(which remains subject to
approval from College) some
preliminary works will be
taking place during the end of
this month/beginning of next
month, including the erection
of scaffolding and the reloca-
tion of some of the library’s
books and seating.
Some noisy work will also be
taking place throughout spring
term but it will be restricted
between 6:00 and 9:00am.
No details have been
released yet regarding plans
for the summer term, however
it is expected that the bulk of
the works will be taking place
during this academic year’s
summer break.
Though generally the student
community is excited for the
prospect of study areas that
don’t send them into thermal
shock, some students remain
doubtful. “Yeah I wouldn’t be
too optimistic”, says one stu-
dent. “I swear a rumor about
library air-con gets spread at
least once a year and has been
for as long as I can remember.”
Indeed, climate control has
plagued the Central Library for
over a decade. The last major
overhaul started in 2007 and
cost over £10m. Issues with
cooling of the higher levels
had from the beginning of
the project become apparent,
with the top two floors hitting
30 degrees Celsius. Efforts
to provide solar shading
were blocked by Westminster
City Council due to aesthetic
reasons (considering the aes-
thetics of the rest of South
Ken Campus, one can only
wonder) and the Chiller and
Service Tower constructed on
the roof of Sherfield and which
cost over £6m failed to hit the
spot quite the way it was meant
to. College’s last multi-million
investment in Library Services,
the Central Library door, has
only managed to keep the heat
in.
Head of Sport Imperial resigns
Lef Apostolakis
G
r a n t
D a n s k i n e ,
H e a d
of Sport
I m p e r i a l ,
has resigned
amidst resurfaced criticism of
the organisation’s treatment of
female athletes. Although the
criticism – which resurfaced
after Imperial published its
institutional culture report
– is unrelated to Danskine’s
direction of Sport Imperial,
it did manage to receive
national coverage once more.
The incident refers to the
sexist mistreatment of the
Women’s Rugby during the
2015 Varsity. Sport Imperial
failed to provide adequate
transport and changing
facilities to the women’s
rubgy teams despite the fact
they were headlining. The
players were also left without
food, stranded without
transportation and called “fat
girls” by management.
Earlier this academic year,
Sport Imperial also came
under fire for running a
sexist ‘Imperial Girls Can’
campaign. The campaign was
meant to encourage sport
participation amongst women
calling on them to “bounce the
calories away”.
Danskine’s resignation
came as a surprise to many
Union staff members and
students even though a
College spokesperson said it
was submitted in December.
For quite some time, the
Sport Imperial website listed
Danskine as “Acting Head of
Sport Imperial”, with some
sources telling felix he was on
indefinite leave. It was only on
Wednesday that the position
was officially shown to be
“vacant” online.
A College spokesperson
told felix that “Imperial is
currently recruiting for a new
Head of Sport, following the
resignation of the previous
postholder in December. The
College is working closely
with Imperial College Union
on the recruitment process.”
No information was
released to us regarding the
circumstances of Danskine’s
sudden resignation, though.
Next week Sport Imperial
and the Union will be sending
out a survey to students asking
them for input on the sport
services offered by College.

pastor were released in return
for clemency of seven Iranian
citizens indicted or imprisoned
by the US government for
sanctions violations.
Richard Ratcliffe, Nazanin’s
husband,attendedthevigiland
delivered a letter addressed to
President Rouhani requesting
a visa so that he might visit
his wife and two-year-old
daughter Gabriella, whose
birthday was spent away
from both parents. He asked
that his wife be given a fair
trial, and for letters of support
sent to her to be delivered.
The 43-year-old advocated
for Iran and the UK to build
better relations “grounded in
mutual understanding” for his
daughter’s future. He wrote: “I
ask for your help in bringing
Nazanin and Gabriella home
because framing the innocent
serves no one, not even
those perpetrating it – it risks
undermining the values Iran
and Islam are proudest of.”
A
c a n d l e - l i t
vigil was
held outside
the Iranian
embassy on
Monday for
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe,
a British-Iranian Thompson-
Reuters charity worker.
Organised by Amnesty
International, supporters
including Imperial students
gathered on Princes’ Gate
calling for Nazanin’s release
from Evin prison in Iran. The
38-year-old was arrested
on the 3rd
of April 2016 at
the check-in desk of Tehran’s
Imam Khomeni airport on
her way back to the UK
after visiting her parents.
Nazanin, a British-Iranian
dual national, was with her
one-year-old daughter, who
has British citizenship only.
The child’s passport was also
confiscated, preventing her
from returning home to her
father in Hampstead.
Nazanin was sentenced
by a closed court to five
years’ imprisonment on
secret charges relating to
“national security”. Amnesty
International has reported
she suffered an unfair
trial, and was subjected to
solitary confinement with no
access to a lawyer or her
family, and forced to make a
confession. Her incarceration
was appealed earlier this
month, a decision is still to
be heard. Accusations were
published in Iranian media
that she is the ringleader of
a spy network for foreign
governments attempting the
“soft overthrow” of the Iranian
republic. Her husband, who
refuted these alegations, has
been told she is being used as
a “political bargaining chip”
and will be released if the
British government come to
an agreement with her jailers.
Nazanin’s mental and physical
health has deteriorated during
her time in prison, with reports
that she was unable to walk
merely weeks following her
sentence and that she was on
hunger strike in November, at
risk of suicide.
The vigil marked exactly

citizenship were released from

Imperial to face LSE at City Varsity Lef Apostolakis
I
mperial will be taking
on LSE this year during
a showcase event to
take place in March.
The event, christened the
City Varsity, will mark the
first time in a long time that
Imperial plays against another
University. (Though earlier last
year the first e-sports varsity
was launched at Gfinity Arena
between King’s , LSE, UCL
yours truly)
The City Varsity is almost
exclusively student led, with
some input from the Union,
and at least for now will only
be featuring matches from
Imperial’s men’s and women’s
rugby. This means there won’t
be any medics playing. When
asked if there were plans to
involve medics in the external
varsity, club captain of men’s
rugby and chief organiser of
the initiative, Josh O’Donnell
told felix that it could happen
but the process would involve
holding trials and bringing
medic players in just for the
guest match.
Regardless, the launch of
the City Varsity has been met
with excitement. According to
rivalry with the medics on
the back burner, Imperial’s
internal Varsity with the
School of Medicine will not
be scrapped. Games will
continue to take place as they
have for the last 15 years and
this year’s VarsityFest will go
ahead as planned.
Whether the City Varsity
will become a tradition will
depend on turnout, but
organisers are optimistic. As
ACC chair Ellie Winstanley
puts it, the games are “testing
the waters because the people
want the water to be tested”.
Hopefully turnout will be
high unlike the 2011 inter-
collegiate Summer Ball
which suffered a loss of
£100,000.
And if it is, there are
plans for expansion, with
expressed involvement
of football, hockey and
netball but also other
sports club that don’t
traditionally participate in
Varsity due to the lack of
medic counterparts, such
as Fencing and Shooting.
O’Donnell, the rivalry with the
medics has simmered down
over the years and there’s
been a great appetite to find
a new rivalry through an
external varsity.
Whether LSE will prove
a worthy rival remains to
be seen. “There’s no bad
blood yet, but we’re working
on it” said Women’s rugby
captain, Charlotte Gisbourne.
Women’s rugby will be kicking
off the event, followed by the
men’s games.
Although it may seem like
this event is putting Imperial’s
