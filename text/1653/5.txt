Jennifer Eden discusses the UAE's
new ban on exotic pets and
Ipswich's new hedgehog officer
B
ig news for big cats
and other exotic
pets. The United
Arab Emirates has
banned the private
ownership and
dealing of wild animals. Status
pets are on the way out and,
hopefully, back into the wild.
Animal rights activists are
understandably thrilled, for
this is a triumph. The UAE was
a hotspot for such narcissistic
displays of animal investments

brighter future for elephants. The process
of male chick culling may also be a horror
of the past with the development of new
technology capable of determining the
gender of a chick before it hatches. It
would allow egg producers to remove
male and infertile eggs before they enter
incubation, so they can be used for human
consumption rather than destroyed on
hatching. But most significant of all the
animal success stories is that Ipswich has
finally got itself a Hedgehog Officer.
With joint funding from the Hedgehog
Preservation Society, Suffolk Wildlife Trust
and Heritage Lottery Fund the role will be
part of an effort to combat the decline of
these wonderful creatures in the area.
Such positive progress justifies a moment
of celebratory reflection. It appears the
dependence we have on animals, and
the importance of treating them well, is
starting to sink in. Respecting our animal
counterparts as equals, empathising with
them, understanding that they are not so
different from us are all crucial lessons in
the move towards a better, less destructive
co-existence.
What’s happening now for animals
provides a shred of optimism for the
world. Amongst all the doom and gloom
of Trump’s presidency and cold war
distrust re-emerging, at least those who
had suffered in silence for the longest are
beginning to be represented. We can be
proud of this, even if it is just rectifying the
problems we caused ourselves.
H
ave you been feeling
down this week?
Allegedly there is
an explanation for
this – some claim it is
the most depressing
week of the year. More specifically,
the Monday that just passed has
been christened 'Blue Monday'
as a result of post-holiday reality
kicking in and everyone generally
feeling a bit shit. The third Monday
of January was described as the
most depressing day of the year by
Cliff Arnell using an equation which
supposedly took into consideration
a multitude of variables such as
weather, debt, monthly salary, time
since Christmas, time since failing
our new year’s resolutions and low
motivational levels.
It cannot be denied that January
can be a tough month emotionally,
financially and psychologically
but many including Ben Goldarce,
notorious for unpicking the misuse of
science and statistics by journalists,
have called the equation and the
whole idea of Blue Monday, a
farce.
I cannot help but agree. A little
research into the matter shows
that Arnell’s equation was derived
to help airlines predict trends in
bookings to improve marketing and
in reality makes no mathematical
sense. By telling us that we are
miserable, airlines can sell holidays
as a pick me up or a cure. By all
accounts this is clever marketing,
exploiting the post Christmas lull
to target January frugality; Blue
Monday encourages us to buy
holidays rather than pinching
pennies throughout January.
Although the idea of Blue Monday
may not be a reality, January is
a tough month for many of us,
especially at Imperial. January
exams, coursework deadlines and
leaving home confort for student
digs gets the best of us down, but
that doesn’t mean that we are all
suddenly depressed.
Depression is a mental illness
that should not be confused with
sadness. Feeling sad or stressed in
the face of January’s challenges is
not unusual or unhealthy, as long as
we continue to prioritise self-care
and the good things in life. If you
are feeling the January blues treat
yourself to a hot bath, a good movie
or some time with friends. Revision
is important but taking breaks is
better for your health and your
learning. And if you feel like you’re
taking January in your stride, don’t
doubt yourself or feel guilty – just
because it is January doesn’t mean
you have to feel sad.
unhappiness. Now according
to Gulf News "Anyone who
takes a leopard, cheetah
or any other kind of exotic
animal out in public will face
a jail term of up to six months
and a fine". Good stuff.
Having read this news after
detailing the potential fate of
neglected exotic pets, I can
hold a glimmer of hope for
human attitudes towards our
animal friends. By the end of
2017 China is set to ban all
ivory trade and processing
activities. As a country
hosting the world’s largest
ivory market, an end to this
is the beginning of a much

I made a
mistake.
Jian Li Chew apologises for his article
last week in light of new information
A
fter the
publishing of
my article last
week, I was
informed that
The Telegraph
article on which I based my
own, which was picked up
from The Daily Mail, was
a gross misrepresentation
of SOAS Student Union’s
campaign. Reading the official
SU statement, I am here to
retract my previous article and
to write an apology.
After reading the article in
the Telegraph, I went on the
SOAS Student's Union site to
find any news article about
this topic. A cursory glance
at the front page, where I had
expected it to be highlighted,
gave me no result, so I as-
sumed that The Telegraph was
a respectable and accurate
source to use.
Instead of the supposed aim
to ban white philosophers,
the BA World Philosophies
programme wants to simulta-
neously teach about hitherto
little known thinkers: the great
Arabic minds like al-Fārābī,
Avicenna and Averroes, the
Indian thinkers Nāgārju-
na, Dińnaga, Uddyotakāra,
Gańgeśa etc. and African phi-
losophers like Kwami Anthony
Appiah, Franz Fanon, Achille
Mbembe, Valentin-Yves Mu-
dimbe, Enrique Dussell and
Walter Mignolo. The teaching
of European philosophy is to
be done by exploring the con-
text of how they developed
and how Enlightenment ideas
of liberty, human rights and
equality developed alongside
the contemporary colonisa-
tion and imperialism. There is
no intention to ban European
philosophy, seeing how the
intention of the course is to
learn how different intellectual
traditions interacted and de-
veloped.
SOAS students had voted to
make “Decolonising the Uni-
versity” the top priority of the
Student Union, with the focus
on reviewing the curriculum
and developing Black and
Minority Ethnic (BME) aca-
demic staff and students as

a form of reparative justice.
Whatever my personal views
on the wider movement of de-
colonisation, as I believe that
all actions in history should
be viewed in context with the
contemporary environment
and not through a modern
lens, this is the choice of the
students involved and must be
accepted.
I apologise for my writing
and the condemnation I had
heaped on the SOAS Student
Union and retract the following
lines. They do not hate white
people, white knowledge or
white civilisation. They are not
snowflakes and do not epito-
mise hate, bigotry, ignorance
and racism. They do not want
to create racist, narrow-mind-
ed, brainwashed, and hateful
idiots, rather to develop them-
selves through a more critical
understanding of philosophy.
Lastly, they are not intolerant.
Lastly in response to my
point about colonialism, I was
not making a moral or sup-
portive case for it, but rather
to state that instead of being
a zero-sum game, to see co-
lonialism for its contemporary
context and that it had led
to good and bad outcomes,
whatever the morally dubious
basis it stems from. Though it’s
coloured by my own personal
benefit from British colonial-
ism in Malaysia and the sub-
sequent development of the
nation after independence, I
sought to challenge the pre-
vailing narrative surrounding
colonialism.
This has been an interesting
topic to cover and I welcome
future opportunities for learn-
ing.
