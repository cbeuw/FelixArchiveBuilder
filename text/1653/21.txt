A
pparently
one of the
most hotly
anticipated
games of
the NFL
season happened a couple
of days ago. Did you know?
I certainly didn’t, but it was
played between two giants
of the game to decide who
would progress for a chance
at the Super Bowl. No, not
a huge piece of crockery for
mammoth breakfast portions,
but the most important date
in the American football
calendar. In pure American
style the Super Bowl is an
event of epic proportions,
with the likes of the Red Hot
Chilli Peppers, Beyoncé, The
Who and Bruce Springsteen
gracing the famous half-time
extravaganzas. Before I even
get into my attempt at taking
this on, I’m already excited
by a sport whose associated
entertainment dwarfs the
Monmouth Male Voice Choir
who sang at the Six Nations
last year (still brilliant I hasten
to add).
I’ve played a number of
sports in my time, but I’ve
never really taken to the great
American pastimes. Of course
I played Rounders at school
(close enough to Baseball)
and being tall meant I could
stand in front of a Basketball
hoop with my arms held up
with reasonable success, but
having Welsh in-laws gives
me loyalty to Rugby. Watch-
ing American Football always
seemed so slow and simple:
short plays culminating in
“go-fetch”, constant breaks
and dramatized field goals.
But I think it’s fair to say, and
you can quote me on this, I
was wrong.
Sunday morning and I’m
stood outside the Union
holding borrowed shoulder
pads and a helmet alongside
our resident pig-skin team,
the Imperial Immortals. The
kit, provided for all members,
makes me look far bigger
and stronger than I am, but
I’ll accept this as a momen-
tary butch-boost. Under the
stoic gaze of Prince Albert,
training starts with some basic
stretches. The camaraderie
and encouragement are
evident from the start, every-
one high-fiving after each
exercise. No boundaries exist
between hardened members
and amateurs, everyone was
welcome and everyone was
included. I’m introduced to
the coach who is more than
happy to integrate me in to
the main training session even
though I know next to nothing
about what’s going on. If
I need to take a balanced
view for fairness, I did not
enjoying the running and was
slightly left behind but that is
exercises specific to their
role. The coaches are clearly
experienced and dedicated
to improving the team’s
performance, having drafted
new tactics over the holidays.
Constant repetition of drills
ensure each player under-
stands their job to the letter.
I’ve been grouped with the
code (not the official name,
I’ve coined this particular
term) is made up of numbers
and words which indicate to
each member of the team the
strategy for this particular
play. Where they need to
run, who is tackling who and
what part of the body they
need to scratch next. OK, that
last one is slightly exagger-
ated but trust me, it could
easily be integrated and the
opposition would be suitably
confused. You’ll have heard it
before on any film featuring
American Football but there
is no agreed format. Each
team has their own language
and by the end of the session,
your mother tongue will be
less fluent in comparison. But
to work as a team. In that
stiffling helmet you cannot
always see the entire picture,
instead relying on everyone
knowing their role perfectly.
Onto the plays. I’m asked
to stand in as a blocker whilst
the rest of the team practice
their movements. This resulted
in the coach giving me the
best life advice I’ve ever
received: “Crouch down,
head up and when signalled
move forward with a small
waddle”. And I did. Brilliantly.
I’m being serious. Not a
single opponent made it past
me. The fact that we faced
an imaginary foe makes it no
less impressive. And knowing
where to pretend block was
pretty damn hard. It was
made much easier by those
next to me in line always
directing and encouraging. I
felt part of the team and even
developed a hankering to try
different field positions.
I take some time out of
my budding tackling career
to talk to some of the guys
who were injured but still
turned up, yet another sign
of their commitment. I get the
impression they miss being on
the field, coming up with any
excuse to be part of the ses-
sion. This is a sport full to the
brim with positive energy, not
just on the pitch but off it too
with plenty of socials and the
upcoming Super Bowl party
in the Union on February 5th.
If you’re looking for a team
sport with opportunities for all
new-comers, I encourage you
to take the first-session-free
offer and become Immor-
tal. Despite dropping down
from the Premier League last
season, they have recorded
the highest number of points
(and over best points differ-
ence) and have won three on
the bounce.

probably the extra pastry I
consumed that morning.
Now warmed up, we
are split into Offense and
Defence, where each part
of the team has separate,
targeted training. Today’s
session is slightly different,
as these groups are usually
split further into field positions
where each player is given
wide receivers where we train
in both running patterns and
catching awkward passes (4
out of 5 isn’t bad) and the
coach is always constructive,
giving tips on how to improve.
In light of the new proposed
tactics, we move back with
the rest of the offense to prac-
tice plays described by what
I now call ‘The Code’. This
the bottom line is this, the sup-
posedly random collection of
numbers and words coalesce
into precise instructions for
the entire team. My previous
description of this sport cer-
tainly comes under scrutiny,
as each player has a specific
tactic determined by the
code, which they must remem-
ber and carry out in order
\\ The camaraderie
and encouragement
were evident from
the start – everyone
was welcome and
