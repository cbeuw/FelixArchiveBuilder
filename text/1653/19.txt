ou known the times
when it seems as
though the world
is constantly trying
to bring you down,
and you just want to
retreat back into your house and
not interact with anyone? Well I
have had those times before and
it is not easy to pick yourself up
and continue. Just last Monday, my
chef stupidly served my Kobe beef
steak medium rare when he knows
I like it bloodier than a Sunday
in Derry – Mondays right?! Well
of course we all need strategies
to perk our moods up and you
should look no further than my
home-brewed remedies that are
guaranteed to instantly return you
back to full form.
First of all I recommend that
you decide to support a political
cause that will inevitably achieve a
degree of success in the new year.
As you will already be aware, the
left is composed of known homo-
sexuals and colluding communists
(often the same thing) and as a
result, they will not be having any
success in the new year (thank
God). One up and coming party
I can see having a lot of success
in the near future is the National
Socialist German Worker’s Party,
and I believe there is a lot that can
be incorporated from these bright
upstarts into the New Republican
Party – perhaps putting some sort
of bright visible icons on minorities
that we don’t trust. The main thing
that is keeping me going through
this week of disappointments
such as Chelsea Manning getting
released (she or he – make a
decision please) is the idea of the
inauguration party I am hosting at
the end of this week. I’ve made a
whole assortment of themed foods
and I even managed to get a Bruce
Springsteen cover band to play at
it, due to a last minute cancella-
tion. I will be serving journalists
on a stick, grab ‘em by the pussy
pies, and she doesn’t have enough
stamina smoked salmon.
It is also worth reflecting (I think
that’s a queer word originally) on
the fact that other people around
the world have it far worse than
you. Whenever I stop to consider
this fact, it instantly puts a spring
in my step – think about how there
are women who won’t be able to
get abortions in certain states due
to a lack of funding for Planned
Parenthood – hilarious! There
are still ethnic minorities who are
afraid to approach the police due
to relentless violence – lol not me!
White is right! Syria is still under
siege and the entirety of the West
no longer cares about whether or
not they receive help – less terror-
ists over here! Just remember that if
it ever seems as though things are
really bad, It’s probably because
you used to touch yourself.
T
he sexist election of
Donald Trump. The
Brexit decision of the UK
to leave the European
Union. The fact that
there is a minuscule
amount of animal fat in the new
five pound notes. All of these
events brought the earth closer to
its eventual apocalypse and it is
precisely in times like this where
we need to acknowledge the fact
that better times are just around the
corner.
My first thing is to surround
myself with comical pictures of
cats, of course making sure that
the cats are of consensual age, as
I have gotten into trouble before
with various members of PETA for
the possession of a few indecent
photos of kittens. In order to
distinguish yourself from the basic
bitch stereotypes of Imperial (You
known the ones. The girls that
wear the green coats with the fur
hoods, the ones who constantly
share Humans of New York posts,
and who always invite you to go
to B@1s because it’s “2for1”) you
must, of course, make sure that
they’re printed on recycled paper
and that the inks contain no traces
of any animal products. Now I’m
just thinking of those stupid sexy
cats. God.
In order to distract myself from
the eventual implosion of the west-
ern political system, I have found
this amazing way of changing
politics. It’s not getting involved in
politics and trying to change things
for the better as, of course, that
would be too much effort. Instead I
have found a way where lefty-poli-
tics actually works and manages to
provide a stable economy – I have
started to take magic mushrooms.
In this magical world, climate
change is actually recognised as a
potential problem, all old people
are taken out and shot to prevent
them from slowing the advance-
ment of progressive politics, and
we finally have a trans-leader in
both 10 Downing Street and the
White House.
We can also look forward to the
fact that soon we will all drown
and die as a result of the polar
ice caps melting and causing the
whole of life on Earth to become
submerged. Eventually after every
greedy human corpse and animal
skeleton has decomposed, after a
few million years we will be ready
to restart and make a greater
planet for everyone. There will also
be less lube so a lot of plusses.
Find your safe space
where your politics
actually work

This week you’re
still trying to get onto
Memeperial. You take
lessons in photoshop.
You try to become
more edgy. But it’s all
in vain, mememasters
are born not made.

This week your
political Facebook rants
reach fever pitch with
the POTUS inauguration
and Brexit talks. Except
you’re not shouting
into an echo chamber,
you’re shouting into a
void. Cos nobody cares.
This week you’re
freezing as you can’t
afford heating. Good
news though, global
temperatures mean
soon you’ll be basking
in tropical climates all
year round. Or you’ll
be under two feet of
water...
This week you’re
finally free of exams,
until the next lab
report that is. And then
the next deliverable.
Oh fuck it.
This week you’re
the moth that’s been
named after Donald
Trump. Ironically,
unlike your namesake,
you’re actually
attracted to things that
are bright.
This week you’re Theresa
May. You decide you’re
fed up of a red, white and
blue Brexit and instead
want a {Insert literally any
adjective here} Brexit. It’s
what the people want after
all.
This week you’re selected
to play at the Presidential
Inauguration. Sure, your
only talent is drunkenly
slurring Bohemian
Rhapsody in Metric but
you’re the best they can
find.
This week you’re the
Union Bar and you’re
60 years old. We
can only imagine the
atrocities you have
witnessed. We are
truly sorry.
This week you’re
still on track to finish
Dry January. Go you!
Slightly less impressive
when nobody’s
invited you for drinks
anywhere. For the
whole month.
This week you’re
the Piccadilly Circus
screens and aren’t
going to be turned on
again until autumn.
Kinda like my sex life.
This week you’re so
obsessed with getting
onto Memeperial you
accidentally submit
some dank memes into
Turnitin. Unsurprisingly
you get flagged for
plagiarism.
This week you realise
the cause of the library
cooling renovations
is down to a FELIX
petition. We did it guys,
we’re the voice of the
students!

Dear John,
Wow. Just wow. I haven’t received
a letter like this since… well I’ve
never actually received anything like
this. Not a letter. Not an email. Not
a call. I once got a series of drunk
texts from an ex which went into a
weird tangent about body hair (not
even my body hair I don’t think, just
the concept of body hair and how
ridiculous it is, and aren’t mammals
just a silly concept) but nothing quite
like this.
Anyway as I was saying, yes, you
definitely have a drinking problem. I
mean unless you actually are terrible
at maths, you certainly lost count
of how many drinks you had… and
there’s no such thing as a pink vodka
coke.
You probably also have a mild
concussion. And you might wake up
with a sexual assault case against
you tomorrow morning, depending
on how happy your mate John is with
HOROSCOPES
the whole ‘tongue down his throat’ sit-
uation. Actually you probably have a
concussion so try not to sleep. Though
considering you won’t get to read this
till Friday I guess this advice is not
going to be particularly useful.
Back to useful advice: Do start
going out with a sharpie so that you
can tally drinks on your arm (though
it might be better to tally them on
your forehead so that your level of
drunkenness can be easily conveyed
to bar staff). Do start wearing t-shirts
with homoerotic slogans such as “I’m
not gay but a tenner’s a tenner”. This
will give your peers fair warning and
might help you come to terms with
your budding sexuality. Finally, do get
yourself a maths tutor.
You are in God’s hands now.
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
Dear Xhris,
I have a drinking problem. Like right now. IK’m drunk and I need help immeedfi-
ately. I went out to Sports Night and got plasterd. I only had like six drinks. One
vodka coke. One vodka redbol. One more vodka coke. No wait my mate John
bought a round of Jagerbombs. Ok so one vodka coke. Then I got a round of
tequeuela. Then I tried to mount the Union Bar. Then all I remember is white light.
Then a vodka coke. Then a pink vodka coke. I think that last one was a double, but
I’m counting it as one. So yeah. Six drinks. Now I’m not sure when I stuck my tongeu
down my mate John’s throat, but I’m sure that I liked it and now I’m really confused
cause I only watched gay porn once like as a joke and I had mixed feelings.
Anyway I’m homo now and my housemate just came in the kitchen and yelled at
me cause I have been reading out loud everything I’ve been writing and its’s like
very late and she was sleeping I think.
Pls help.
Yours faithgullu
John Smith (my real name I swear)
