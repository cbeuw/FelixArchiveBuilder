ome like it hot.
But others can’t
stand an inkling
of chilli anywhere
near their
food. However,
perhaps they ought to try,
as researchers from the
University of Vermont have
found that spicy food may
prolong life expectancy.
In particular, consumption
of red hot chilli peppers
was associated with 13%
reduction in total mortality in
a large-scale study. Primarily
these deaths were due to
heart disease or strokes.

have antimicrobial
properties, keeping
our gut bacteria in

How hot can you handle?
Lizzie Riach looks at a study claiming that ‘spicing up your life’, could actually prolong it
Perhaps this is why they have
been used as an ingredient
by our spice-loving ancestors,
who seemed to enjoy the
burning sensation of hell
inside their mouths.
Using National Health
and Nutritional Examination
data from around 16,000
Americans over a period of
23 years, they examined the
number and causes of deaths
between two large subsets;
those who ate red chillies,
and those that didn’t.
Perhaps the receptors
specifically used for sens-
ing heat from chemicals
like capsaicin could have
something to do with the
increased health levels, or
maybe there’s a component
in capsaicin itself. Some
theories include the idea that
capsaicin can help to prevent
obesity and regulates blood
flow in the heart, as well as
possessing antimicrobial prop-
erties within the gut.
So you heard it here. Next
trip to Nandos, see how hot
you can muster.
