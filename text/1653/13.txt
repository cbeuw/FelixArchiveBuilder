A series of
final problems
| Sherlock
Indira Malik
In 2010 when Sherlock was
first introduced to the world
as Arthur Conan Doyle’s
great detective being brought
into the 21st
century, co-crea-
tor Steven Moffat explained
his motivations in making the
series to Premium Hollywood
thus: “This wasn’t a case of,
‘Let’s grab that off the shelf
and update it.’ It was, ‘We
love this, we think every-
body’s been getting it wrong,
and we think we can get it
right.’ Unless you think you’re
correcting everyone else, you
shouldn’t be doing something.
You should be saying, ‘Now
this is the way it should be
done.’ “ Admirable words,
certainly but it does beg the
question: what exactly did
Moffat and co-creator Mark
Gatiss think should be done?
The Final Problem, which
could very well be the last
ever episode of Sherlock
given the demand for stars
Benedict Cumberbatch and
Martin Freeman seemed
at points to be playing a
game of “bad screenwriting”
bingo – checking off one
contrivance after the other.
The Sherlock Holmes canon
is known above all for its
grounding in rational thought;
that Holmes should remain
the ideal of the triumph of
reasoning over the mystical,
substance over style was a
conviction that Conan Doyle
stuck doggedly to even
though he was intrigued
by the possibility of the
supernatural in his life. Gatiss
and Moffat’s Sherlock in its
seven year run was known
for honouring this tradition
even as the writers adapted
and re-formed the original
stories for the episodes. The
Final Problem however chose
to dive head first into the
world of the impossible in a
move that made watching
the episode feel like being
suspended in a constant state
of anticipation – waiting for
the other shoe to drop – wait-
ing for Sherlock to wake up,
waiting for everything to be
explained.
From the first moments we
are plunged into a world
populated with killer clowns,
portraits that cry blood, men
who can jump from burning
second storey flats onto busy
London streets and walk
away unharmed, we are
asked to believe that a secret
omnipotent Holmes sister lives
in an Azkaban-like prison
fortress plotting revenge for
the time her infant brother
didn’t play with her (despite
her mind control abilities).
We are asked to believe in
a detective who walks into a
brightly lit room and cannot
distinguish glass from empty
air, we are asked to believe
that Mary Watson, before
her entirely unplanned death,
recorded several DVD mes-
sages and arranged for them
to be delivered to her hus-
band and to his best friend
to aid them in their emotional
journey from the grave. We
were asked to believe a child
turned the memory of his
murdered best friend into the
memory of a dog. We were,
in short, asked to believe
too much, suspend our dis-
belief for too long. Sherlock
was once a show built on
ingenuity – plot twists that
were surprising but could be
predicted if one looked hard
at the clues, it was a show
that invited the audience to
deduce it, yet here, in its last
hurrah, it gave up intelli-
gent dramatization and
character devel-
opment for
a remake

The problems with The
Final Problem are the ones
that have steadily accumu-
lated throughout Series 4
which progressively became
detached from any sem-
blance of reality. Chekov’s
gun’ is the principle that once
a gun has been placed on
the stage, the rules of fiction
demand the trigger to be
pulled. In Series 4 in general,
