F
or many, the
Moomins hold
nothing more than
the nostalgia of
childhood. While
some have no idea
what they are, for others the
word conjures up a vague
image of a hippo-esque
creature that adorns cutesy
bottles and notepads. There
is no particular reason to
go any deeper than these
associations, but it was during
attendance at an interactive
exhibit dedicated to all things
Moomin – and when I say
interactive, I mean ducking
through ‘forests’, crouching
in a sandy tent, and wading
through ‘snow’ – that the
depth of these children’s
stories, and their importance
at times such as ours, came to
light.
Tove Jansson, the author
and illustrator of the Moomin
books, was born in Helsinki in
1914. Becoming an artist and
illustrator at a young age,
depictions of the Moomin
trolls can be seen in her early
work in way of a signature.
They soon came into their
own however, with the first
book, The Moomins and the
Great Flood, appeared in
1945. On the surface, these
were cute stories for children
– a family (albeit trolls) look-
ing for their father, Moomin
Papa, who has disappeared
in an adventure filled with
danger and crumbling
façades. However, take into
account the mood of the time,
when so many fathers had
Bandler. The secret ruby
was their love, hidden away
and illegal – as homosexual
relationships were in Finland
at the time. Jansson poured
her anxieties and her broken
heart into her art. It is now
our turn to do the same.
This is only one example of
an artist putting their pain into
art. Go to any art museum
and you can see whole rooms
dedicated to artists’ creations
that stemmed from civil
war, emotional turmoil, and
forcibly repressed feelings.
The simplicity and warmth of
Jansson’s defiance, however,
is what is striking here: she
made children’s books that
gave comfort to a completely
oblivious audience, whilst
including deeply personal
and political messages. The
beginnings were very small,
with the first Moomin Troll
being drawn on the wall of
her family’s outhouse when
she was a child following an
argument with her brother.
She described the doodle as
the “ugliest thing imaginable”.
Her uncle had warned her of
TakingaleafoutofToveJansson'sbook
Jenny Shelley
disappeared to the war, and
a surprisingly political note
arises. In fact, Jansson’s own
brother had ‘disappeared’ in
the war with no idea when
– or even if – he would be
back.
The following book, Comet
in Moominland, tells the tale
of a comet that forces the
Moomins to gather together
and flee their home. This,
again, was extremely reflec-
tive of the times. However,
perhaps the starkest example
of the use of her art form to
express a piece of herself,
a piece of her pain, was the
creation of the characters of
Thingumy and Bob. These
two were only ever depicted
together with a stolen red
ruby – initially only referred
to as ‘the content’ – hidden in
the suitcase that they carried
with them. By children’s
character standards, this does
not seem so unusual or note-
worthy. However, we now
know that this was Tove Jans-
son’s way of expressing her
feelings towards her lover: a
married woman called Vivica
the ‘Moomin Troll’, a horrible
creature that would catch her
if it caught her sneaking out of
bed to steal from the pantry.
When she was young, she
was terrified of the Moomin,
but she overcame the demon,
developing ownership over it
and creating the characters
that are now so well loved.
The advice from Carrie
Fisher, thrust forward in Meryl
Streep’s wonderful speech
at the Golden Globes, rings
completely true: make your
broken heart into art. But not
having a giant platform or
many means of expression
doesn’t make it of less impor-
tance. Take what scares you,
what breaks your heart, and
turn it into something else,
something you can overcome
and maybe even befriend.
Not all sources of heartbreak
can be turned into a cuddly
character (orange, wig-wear-
ing Trump-in Troll anyone?),
but the ones that can are a
solid start.

I
bet you're worried. I was
worried. I was worried
about vaginas. I was
worried about what we
think about vaginas,
and even more worried
that we don't think about
them” wrote Eve Ensler in the
introduction of The Vagina
Monologues, a compilation
of over 200 women’s feelings
about their body and their
sexuality. Ensler interviewed
and talked with them about
their vaginas: how do they
perceive it? How they feel
about ‘the vagina’ in general?
What would your vagina say?
Ensler gave them the space
to talk freely, and listened to
their stories.
In this 90-minute play, the
actors beautifully express sto-
ries of shame, fear, fantasy,
discovery, happiness, relief,
and anger. It almost feels like,
through listening to their per-
ceptions of their vaginas, we
are able to meet the original
storytellers.
Watching the performance,
you’ll hear about plenty of
pussies, countless cunts, var-
ious vulvas, tonnes of twats,
plus some punanis thrown in
for good measure. Some of
the monologues are based
on an individual woman’s
particular experience: from
a hilarious piece on a sex
worker who pleasures only
women, to an eye-widening
(and leg crossing) account
from a witness of a birth, and
a strong testimony on the Bos-
nian war and sexual violence
inflicted on women. Other
monologues are thematically
and emotionally linked, with
Ensler combining different
experiences together, such as
the powerful discussion of the
treatment of trans women by
wider society.
The Vagina Monologues
isn’t an activist speech with
complicated words, but rather
manages to be elegantly
written without being exces-
sive. The messages of these
combined pieces create a
strong, emotionally charged
narrative. It’s funny and light
hearted most of the time – a
6 year old says her vagina
smells like “snowflakes,” and
you’ll have to go see the play
to hear what an ex lawyer
said about moaning… – but
between the joy and laugh-
ter, you can also find sad,
despairing pieces about vio-
lence inflicted upon women.
The Vagina Monologues is
simultaneously an accept-
ance statement, an invitation
to discussion, and a free
expression. It is a beautiful
and artistic way to give back
to vagina owners the power
to speak and control what is
said about their own body
parts; to redefine and re-ap-
propriate themselves.
It felt therapeutic to hear
and read the script: as both
a spectator and actor in the
play, it brings me relief to
hear this strong testimony
about what others have to
say about their vagina. While
some men might find it threat-
ening or unnecessary, the
play doesn’t aim to exclude
men – rather it shows them a
rare, respectful portrayal of
vaginal experience.
Indeed, it is refreshing
and cathartic to finally hear
voices break this taboo in
a non-sexualised, non-man-
centred way. In the end, it is
not about vaginas, but rather
about everything that gravi-
tates around them: the ideas
perpetrated by our society;
how people are ashamed of
their vagina; how people wish
it was different – how they
ended up believing it should
not have hair, that its shape is
disgraceful, or that it naturally
smells bad. It is about how
difficult it is to discover and
appreciate your vagina when
it is physically hidden from
you.
In a culture where shaming
feels omnipresent, and gen-
eral assumptions fit humans
into boxes, demanding a
certain body standard, rela-
tionship status, or orientation,
The Vagina Monologues
invites people to discuss and
open up about their feelings.
Everybody should feel free to
be who they want and to love
the bodies they have. They
should not be told what to do
with it.
Having a vagina shouldn’t
be a source of shame, or put
a target on someone’s back.
To work towards greater tol-
erance, Ensler chose the path
of artistic expression, and as
more people read, watched
and realised the impact of the
play, it became a worldwide
movement. In 1998, after
a success in New York, the
author created “V-Day” (V
standing for Vagina, Victory,
Valentine), a worldwide activ-
ist movement staging the play
in different countries in aid of
the struggle to end violence
against women and girls. This
movement expands each year
and poignant, game-chang-
ing representation takes
place in countries where the
condition of women needs
urgent improvement. Each
performance raises aware-
ness as well as money for
these causes. The play con-
tinues to give these women
the power to talk, bringing
gender equality back into the
conversation.
This year, FemSoc and Impe-
rial’s student community will
put on their own The Vagina
Monologues in celebration of
V-Day!
It’s not too late if you want
to play your part in this
global movement so give us
a shout (feminist@imperial.
ac.uk) if you’d like to get
involved. And make sure you
come see us in February!
Love and cunts,
