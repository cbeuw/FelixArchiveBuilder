An immaculate conception?
Barrafina strikes again, causing two
food babies to spring from nowhere
with delights such as croquetas,
carabineros and milhojas. Confused?
Read on.
like a dessert. The stalk was
slightly sweet, the creamy,
distinct flavours of the goat’s
cheese cut through, assisted
by a drizzle of honey. If you
love goat’s cheese, you will
fall in love with this dish.
Our last savoury order,
the classic tortilla, arrived as
a circular, inch-thick cake,
created under the watchful
eye of the chef who was con-
stantly flipping the tortilla and
testing the temperature with
his hand. I understood the
amount of care that was put
into this dish as the golden
yellow juices flowed out from
the centre as we cut it in
half – the egg was cooked
to retain a slight liquidity,
encasing the flavourful onion
B
est friend in town?
You just have to
take them to one of
the best restaurants
in town and order
three times your
normal portion of food – and
roll out of the restaurant with
a six-month food baby hoping
to ‘walk’ it off with a tube
journey to the next.
So when my friend came
down to London all the way
from Durham (for a breather,
she said), I got very excited,
nearly as excited as those
primary school days when I
couldn’t sleep before a field
trip, and started preparing for
her visit. The key was coming
up with a list of restaurants
to take her to. This was easy
with our matching standards
for good food. And with a
few hours of discussions, we
narrowed it down to (drum-
roll please):
Barrafina!
Barrafina is a mini-chain of
tapas bars serving modern,
authentic, Spanish tapas.
Landing its first site in Soho
in 2007, it has gained a cult
following of hungry custom-
ers, reflected by the hour-long
queues every day outside
its doors, pages of heated
reviews and a Michelin
star. With the opening of its
second branch on Adelaide
Street in 2014 and its third
brand on Drury Lane in
2015, its growth has been
unstoppable, even under
its no-reservation policy all
through the years. If people
are still queuing up after ten-
odd years, you have to admit
this place must be good.
Under our anxiety issues
and shared hatred of queues,
we dragged ourselves out
of bed bright and early on a
Sunday morning, making it
to the door of their Adelaide
Street branch a quarter-hour
before the lunch session
started. We were among the
first to queue – perhaps the
wintry winds and the January
drizzle were off-putting to
some.
After 15 minutes of waiting
in anticipation, we entered (or
happily skipped) through the
glass doors into a brightly-lit,
stylish room, and took our
seats on the retro-looking
red stools around a mar-
ble-topped bar. On the bar
was their menus, with their
tapas section on the left and
various alcoholic beverages
on the right. We were also
presented with a chalkboard
menu with their daily specials.
Following the hours of
research in the form of
scrolling through Instagram, I
chanted out our order to the
waiter behind the bar like a
sorcerer, watching him key in
the names after a slight nod.
Our dishes were made into a
list, thoughtfully sectioned so
they would be served in 2’s to
a maximum of 3 at a time.
At Barrafina, all the waiters
and chefs work behind the
bar. We could see everything
in action. I was amazed at
how they worked in such an
efficient, flawless, almost-re-
laxed manner despite the
small space and during the
busy lunch hour: waiters
taking orders, serving food,
chefs working at their respec-
tive stations.
Our first dish came as
swiftly as the wind outside:
a bite-sized fried oyster
served on an oyster shell with
their signature crab croquetas
– a pair of deep fried, golden
brown crab balls with a
creamy filling.
We let our taste buds savour
the after-taste of the starters
before our special order
arrived: the carabineros
prawn. This palm-sized prawn
was in a deep red colour, still
smoking hot from the pan.
We took care, nearly burning
the tips of our fingers, ripped
off the head, sucked out the
glorious juices, and greedily
savoured the tender meat. It
was a splurge for the wallet
but a luxury for the senses.
The arroz de marisco
landed on the table as we
were licking the prawn juices
off our fingers. Reminiscent of
the traditional paella, the rice
was like a mountain of gold
nuggets with mussels, clams
and squid studded amongst
it. The rice exploded with the
essence of the sea.
The stuffed courgette flower
was a bit of a controversial
dish between us. The flower,
with the petals and the stalk,
was the length of my hand,
stuffed with goat’s cheese
and lightly fried. It was almost
Christy Lam
a lime and chilli salsa. The
hot, sweet, salty juices from
the oyster burst through the
crunchy tempura skin in the
mouth. Next was the padron
peppers – a staple dish at
any tapas restaurant. These
peppers came as a plate of
bright green lanterns, gently
fried and seasoned with
sea salt. It wasn’t greasy at
all, and surprisingly sweet.
Ending our first ‘course’ was
broth inside.
It would be a crime to leave
Barrafina without tasting
their signature dessert – the
milhojas. We added this to
the list even knowing our food
baby was entering the second
trimester. The milhojas looked
like a French millefeuille, but
much better: two slices of
airy, crispy puff pastry sand-
wiching a light vanilla cream
and rich, indulgent, spiked
custard. The combination of
flavours and textures was
miraculous.
Eight dishes, two girls with
two food babies on a Sunday
afternoon. What could be
better?

Quiteaninnocuous,andyetsurprising
vegetable, the humble aubergine
(or eggplant) is a versatile food for
all manners of culinary pursuits, and
others.
Aubergines and their many uses
Y
es, the aubergine
– delicious in
dips, smokey
and rich, and
yet equally
at home in a
spicy, lip-smacking curry, the
aubergine is a vehicle for
flavour without compare. I
think my love affair began
when I would take home small
scoops of baba ghanouj,
a levantine dip of smoked,
roasted aubergine, with
tahini and lemon, after school
innumerable packed curry
lunches that I faithfully took to
school – not that I can com-
plain, for those curries were
the highlight of the week,
compared to the Thermos
of Dal from which I usually
sipped. So you could say that
from my local turkish deli.
Savouring the creamy, salty
and yet slightly bitter paste,
I was transported away from
deary England to an oasis,
filled with travellers from
across the desert, sharing
tales and eating. What an
innocent, and dull, life I lived.
In a family that ate very
little meat, aubergines were
used to great effect – they’re
a traditional northern Indian
vegetable, and as such
made their way into the
the aubergine and I have
quite the history – and to this
day, it is still one of my favour-
ite vegetables.
And yet, some people are
still so afraid of purple beast
that they decry it as bitter, or
seedy – allegations that are
so rarely true in this day and
age. I would encourage you
all to venture forth and try the
recipe below with aubergines,
as it really is very simple and
much tastier than many of the
kale and quinoa vegetarian
dishes floating around.
If that doesn’t take your
fancy, however, I am reliably
informed that aubergines also
have a number of non-culi-
nary uses, mainly as a sex toy
for the enthusiastic experi-
menters who have gone well
past the root vegetable size,
and are looking for something
with a bit more girth. I can’t
condone these uses, but I
admire their efforts – some of
the aubergines I’ve seen have
been the size of my forearm.
Whichever way you use your
aubergine, I hope you enjoy
it.
Melanzane alla Parmigiana
A classic Italian dish, our esteemed
chef presents her simple, student
friendly version. Cook it for that hot
vegetarian girl on your corridor –
who knows, she might come back for
seconds?
I
still can remember my
editor’s voice, before
Christmas, saying that I
might want to try writing
more meaty recipes:
quick and easy, student
friendly meat dishes. I can
even see him smiling while
he reads this (maybe I should
say “Hello!”) but well, this is
another meat-free edition.
But I have an excuse; I love
all my vegetarian readers.
And I have to think about
them every time I write an
article – finding subjects for
you, pretentious reader, is
Andrada Balmez
complicated to say the least.
But next week we will all have
the post-exams binge so you
can start saving some money
for that now.
Ingredients:
4 medium aubergines
knob of butter
500 g mozzarella
Tomato sauce
1 onion
1 clove garlic (the bigger, the
better)
2 glugs of olive oil
Fresh basil leaves (just in case
you don’t know that the edible
part of the basil are the leaves
– yes, I speak from my own
experience: some people don’t)
2 eggs
Parmesan (depends on how big
a cheese-fan you are)
Start by slicing the auber-
gines. They shouldn’t be
thicker than 0.5 cm and you
can cut them either on the
long side or the short one,
getting nice round slices.
Depending on how good
your oven is – and if it’s a
hall oven probably not very
good – you might need to
pre-cook them a little bit.
You can either put them on
a single layer on a tray and
cook them for five minutes in
a pre-heated oven at 175˚C
or you can slightly fry them
in a frying pan – one minute
each side will do.
Chop the onion and the
garlic as fine as possible. Fry
them in the olive oil until the
onions are golden – be care-
ful, you want them golden,
not brown. Add the tomato
sauce and stir on high heat
for five minutes.
Use a pretty deep tray and
spread the butter all over it,
including the sides. Arrange a
layer of aubergine slices in it.
Cover with tomato sauce and
add some mozzarella. Make
sure to divide the sauce and
the mozzarella – you want
a nice spread between each
layer of aubergines.
Repeat this step until you
finish all the aubergines,
sauce and mozzarella. If
your tray is not very deep,
you might not finish them;
remember that you want a
bit of space left at the top of
the tray so that nothing will
overflow. Try to have a last
layer of tomato sauce and
mozzarella.
On the top, add some
grated parmesan and the
basil leaves – chopped or
not, depending on your
preference. Salt and pepper
to taste (I add just the pepper
and some chilli).
Bake it for 20-25 minutes
at 175˚. Five minutes before
the end, pour over the beaten
eggs and return to the hot
oven – they make a nice
creamy top.
Good job! Pat yourself
on the back – you totally
deserve this.
