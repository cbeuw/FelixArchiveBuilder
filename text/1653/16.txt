Qasim Mahmood tells you
why you should be excited for
the latest entry in the Persona
series
\\ The Persona

dungeon crawler where you
hunt down demonic creatures
and battle them using your
Personas. This dichotomy
seems strange, but the crux
is that these two parts of the
game depend on each other.
As the Persona is based on
the main character’s psyche,
then by forging bonds and
relations with other people
you increase the potential of
your Persona and can unlock
T
here are very few
games which I have
absolute faith in.
I was incredibly
sceptical about both
Final Fantasy XV
and also The Last Guardian,
which was my personal
Game of the Year 2016; in
fact, I was almost convinced
at least one of them would
be a massive train wreck.
Even games like Nioh and
Nier: Automata, both of
which seem like they will be
great, may not live up to
expectations. However, I am
convinced, beyond a shadow
of a doubt, that Persona 5 will
be absolutely phenomenal.
Persona 5 is a turn-based
role-playing game developed
However, he soon awakens a
power: his titular Persona, a
supernatural being brought
to life as a manifestation of
his personality and psyche.
He and his friends all find
themselves with Personas, and
they form a vigilante group
called the “Phantom Thieves”
which they use to bring justice
to those who deserve it.
The Persona series has an
interesting history, as they
are in fact spin-off games of
a larger franchise. This fran-
chise, Shin Megami Tensei, is
extremely popular in Japan;
the first instalment in the
series was released in 1987
on the NES, and the series
has only grown since then.
The mainline games consist of
Megami Tensei titles, and they
spawned numerous spin-offs,
including Devil Summoner,
Digital Devil Saga, Devil Sur-
vivor and of course Persona,
the largest and most success-
ful spin-off of the franchise,
which itself has spawned
spin-off titles. There is little, if
any, continuity between the
games, though they do share
certain elements such as
gameplay mechanics, themes
and settings.
Interestingly, Persona 5 is
actually the sixth mainline
entry in the Persona franchise.
The first few games have not
aged gracefully as Persona 3
was where the series really hit
its stride and changed up its
formula for the better, which
continued over to Persona 4
and Persona 5. The games
are an incredibly strange mix;
during the day, you play as
a schoolboy going about his
daily life, going to school,
interacting with his class-
mates, joining clubs and so
on; but at night it becomes a
new Personas. Every activity
you do, be it interacting with
friends, playing sports or
even doing well in an exam,
increases your stats and aids
in the battles you will face
later on.
Despite Persona 3, 4 and
5 sharing so many qualities,
Atlus manages to make all
three games feel incredibly
different. All three games
have their own distinctive
colour; blue in Persona 3,
yellow in 4 and red in 5.
These colours set the mood
and main theme of the entire
game; Persona 3 is extremely
dark and moody, as its main
theme is death and rebirth;
Persona 4 on the other hand
is joyful and its main theme is
acceptance. Persona 5 seems
to be full of anger; its main
theme is being freed from the
shackles of society, and this
is the driving force behind its
main character.
Persona 5 is also oozing
with style; every animation,
menu and speech bubble
has flair and a single unique
aesthetic that looks absolutely
gorgeous. The are no walls
of text; everything pops
and even the most mundane
things, like the battle results
screen, suddenly becomes
very exciting. The game-
play remains solid with a
traditional turn-based combat
system; enemies can be
knocked down by exploiting
their weaknesses, and if all

enemies are knocked down,
characters become able to
perform ‘All-Out Attacks’,
though now you can also
convince other enemies to
join you as a Persona.
Persona 5 is a huge leap
forward for the series, espe-
cially given that the previous
instalment was on the PS2.
Despite the long wait and
subsequent delay, it is finally
launching in the west on the
4th
of April 2017. The Japa-
nese reviews are extremely
positive, and I cannot wait for
its release worldwide.

school after being accused
