Inclusivity, disability, employment
– to disclose or not disclose?
Disabilities have a perception of being a ‘cost’, but they can bring great
benefits to the workplace or university.

Disabilities Officer
A
s someone
with a disabil-
ity myself, I
always thought
that it would be reasonable
to presume that companies
would be less likely to
hire someone t­
hat would
‘cost’ them more in terms
of time and/or money for
reasonable adjustments.
Since it’s internship appli-
cations season I thought
I would write this article
to give a better, more
accurate perspective of
the issue – and hopefully
attempt to answer the
question of whether one
should disclose.
It is reasonable to think
that companies want to
minimise expenses at all
costs: we have seen trends
for companies to move
manufacturing and call
centre operations to other
countries to reduce costs,
right? Surely this is part
of the problem: the per-
ception that people with
disabilities cost more than
your average Joe.
Many research reports
have been published about
this issue, and all of the
case studies agreed that in
the end hiring people with
disabilities is good for
the bottom-line. A recent
guidance publication from
the Department for Work
and Pensions list many
benefits to the company:
for example, hiring people
with disabilities can bring
additional skills such as
BSL, increase the diversi-
ty, enable a better service
for the diverse range of
customers, and increase
the number of high quality
applicants. Employers
also reported that provid-
ing adjustments resulted in
benefits such as retaining
valuable employees, im-
proving productivity and
morale, reducing workers’
compensation and training
costs, and improving
company diversity. The
publication found that
since the adjustments are
usually low cost, they are
much cheaper than the
for the adjustments if
needed.
But let’s look at some
stats: those with a disabili-
ty are twice as likely to be
unemployed compared to
non-disabled people in the
UK. This could be due to
inaccessible workplaces,
negative attitudes from
employers, or simply
inflexible working hours.
But does that mean you
should not disclose?
Well, disclosure is
simply a word to describe
the kind of tricky situation
of deciding whether you
choose to tell the employer
you’re disabled; it’s not
just a case of whether you
do it, but also, when you
do it. Personally, I ask
myself the question “can I
do the job without my dis-
ability affecting my per-
formance?” If the answer
is “yes” then I don’t
disclose straight away;
but otherwise it becomes
a case of when you should
disclose, because you defi-
nitely should! There are
many things an employer
can do to help, but nothing
will be done if you do not
raise your voice. If your
disability is rather obvious
(like mine) then disclosing
as early as possible would
mean fewer awkward
surprises at interviews
and such. However, the
above is merely my own
personal advice, and above
The importance of
raising disability
awareness
B
efore stepping up for this role
earlier this year, I tried to look for
the Disabilities Officer at the time
to ask for some advice. I discovered,
after three days of searching, that no one
ran in the elections, so the position was
not filled. Even though this position seems
niche in the Imperial community, it is
extremely important for those who need it
and for those who may not know that help is
there, I found this to be disappointing. This
was one of the main reasons I ran. I really
want to create a supportive environment
and maximise inclusivity and integration.
As well as attempt to change the culture
about disabilities in the Imperial and wider
community.
It is such a critical and hopeful time for
those with disabilities, as the White City
campus shows great potential for a more
accessible environment and better services.
I recently went to look around the new
campus to ensure that we have the best
possible facilities to meet the needs of
everyone.
It is important to raise awareness about

had as much experience with disabilities an
insight into the variety of disabilities, as well
as the needs of those affected. Thus I have
been organising many events for Disability
History Month (22nd November to 22nd
December), which display the difficulties
faced by Imperial students on a daily basis.
The events vary from disability sports events
to British Sign Language workshops, as well
as information stalls and talks! And we need
your help – you can volunteer for the events
