oohoo it’s
s e l f - c a r e
awareness
week! I
hope you’re as excited
about that as I am! No?
Okay – well keep reading
and see how you feel at the
end.
When I first became
RCSU Welfare Officer
(aka ‘The RCSU Condom
Guy’), I wanted to put self-
care on my agenda from
the off. It’s something I
don’t feel is encouraged
much on campus; there is
plenty of information and
dissemination of services
to help us when things go
wrong, but nowhere near
enough about how to stop
things happening in the
first place.
But what does self-care
actually mean? The idea
is, surprisingly enough,
how to care for yourself:
how to keep mentally and
physically healthy, and
knowing when to seek
help for something you
cannot deal with yourself.
There are two main strands
of self-care. Firstly, it’s
stopping problems before
they start – healthy daily
and lifestyle choices will
help do this, as well as ad-
dressing problems before
they develop too far.
Secondly, it’s empowering
us with the knowledge and
confidence to deal with
minor ailments ourselves,
where possible, since
this is inevitably quicker
and more personal, and
reduces the strain on
health services.
A lot of self-care is
common sense, really,
but it is worth reminding
ourselves of it, and to
explicitly spend time
thinking about our own
self-care methods. It is
all quite personal, and
different things will work
for different people, but
here are some things I’d
suggest:
Health
Disclaimer: not a
doctor. (FREMULON!)
· Probably the most
obvious thing I’ll say: keep
active. Be it just walking
to and from campus
everyday (unless you live
in Beit, in which case that
certainly does not count),
or having some focussed
exercise time. Find what
works best for you and
your timetable, but don’t
overdo it! Recognise you
have your limits.
· Eat healthily: another
superobviousone.Healthy
eating isn’t about restrict-
ing what you eat, it’s about
balance and enjoyment!
We’re all basically scien-
tists here, so experiment.
Play around with your diet
and find what makes you
feel better. Our bodies all
react very differently to
different foods, so there is
no one-size-fits-all diet.
· Sleep: get enough
quality sleep. While
there’s no fixed amount
for everyone, generally,
having uninterrupted
sleep, in a settled location
(i.e. your bed) for a suffi-
cient amount of time will
lead to greater daytime
energy levels, productiv-
ity, and emotional stabil-
ity (which is nice to have
every so often.)
· Pharmacists ≠ just
cashiers: did you know
you have to have a full
degree to become a phar-
macist? They are trained
to give advice on minor
ailments and everyday
health issues, but are crim-
inally underused. Next
time you have a cold, or an
ache, or similar, consider
going to your local Boots
and talking to someone
there (they also have an
amazing meal deal – I’d
recommend the smoked
ham and egg club with
Quavers and an Innocent
smoothie.)
Social life/work life
· Don’t forget to have
a social life: work’s hard,
and important, but don’t
forget that connections
with people are crucial;
they can make you feel
valued and build confi-
dence, so don’t (regularly)
sacrifice socialising for
work. It’s easy to neglect,
so actively slotting in time
for socialisation during
busy times can be useful
· Don’t forget to do
work (please forgive the
mitigate them. Be lame
and write these things
down; make your self-care
plan explicit rather than
something you sort of do
in the background
· Plan ahead where
possible: don’t let life
throw nasty surprises
your way for things you
could have prepared for.
Having a basic idea of
what you want to achieve
during the next week, and
compartmentalising things
on paper can help things
become less overwhelm-
ing.
So, those are my main
tips but, hey, what do I
know really? I’m just
another student. Find
what works for you and
keep to that. I would also
say, though, that it’s easy
to worry that you’re not
doing enough of the ‘right’
thingsyoushouldbedoing,
or that you’re becoming
stressed about your stress.
Self-care is important,
but it’s not possible to
always get things right!
A major part of self-care
is knowing when to get
help. The simple idea
being: seek help when you
can’t deal with a problem
yourself anymore. The
steps in between are very
important, though. There
are many stages between,
for example, ‘feeling a bit
down’ and full blown de-
pression, yet often people
don’t act until the last
stage. There needs to be
a culture shift at Imperial
so that we don’t feel like
we should have problems,
or accept them as a natural
part of being an Imperial
student. We deserve to be
happy whilst we study,
and to feel empowered to
stop major issues before
they develop.

Devil’s advocacy): uni-
versity can be a constant
barrage of temptation to
do something that isn’t
your work and a skill we
all need to possess is that
of saying ‘no’. Sometimes,
work really does need to
come first and recognising
that there will be other
nights out, house parties,
pub trips etc. is necessary.
General points
· Recognise your
weaknesses: we all have
them – I know, myself,
I’m so bad at prioritising
what I spend time on, and
often side-line myself
with things I shouldn’t
be doing (like this article
maybe…?). By embracing
your weaknesses, you
can begin to look how to
