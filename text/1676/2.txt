Imperial is only as good as its failures
A
mid all the
horrific revela-
tions of sexual
m i s c o n d u c t
that are being unearthed
in both Hollywood and
Westminster currently,
one of the main questions
being asked is ‘how?’How
could they have gotten
away with it for so long?
How much bravery does it
take the people who have
suffered to come forward?
How can we stop this from
happening again?
Many of the articles and
coverage has focused on
individual cases – while
this is important, it is
also vital to look at what
structures were in place
to allow them to carry on
with impunity in the first
place. These men, and
many others who commit-
ted similar acts, did so in a
culture that allowed them
to get away with it – a
culture that didn’t listen
to those who spoke out, or
didn’t take them seriously
enough.
But while we’re used
to looking on from afar at
these cases, I want us to
focus a bit closer to home.
Statistics from the UK
police say that 400,000
women will be the victims
of sexual violence each
year – the majority of
these will suffer in silence,
without reporting what
has happened. University
campuses are no different:
the NUS has reported that a
quarter of women students
have been sexually as-
saulted, and many more
harassed. Those who do
come forward are only the
tip of the iceberg.
About two months ago,
one former student who
had been sexually assault-
ed got in touch with me,
to tell her story. But while
the assault alone would
have been horrific enough
to endure, what followed
when she reported it was
far worse: a seven-month
long investigation, during
which time she felt
ignored, unsupported, and
not listened to. She was
passed from the Union
to the College, and back
again, with no single
point of contact. She went
for long periods with
absolutely no contact from
those in charge, despite
numerous emails. The
whole experience greatly
damaged her mental
health, to the point where
she felt she was losing her
grip on reality.
She raised the com-
plaint when she found out
the perpetrator would be
assuming a position of au-
thority in a student society,
but – shockingly – when
the verdict came through,
the Union said that, since
he wasn’t in that position
when he committed the
assault, it had no impact,
and he should remain in
post. To me, this shows a
complete misunderstand-
ing of how sexual violence
works: it’s not really about
desire or lust, but power,
and how abusers can
wield it over others. At a
time when this message
is being shouted loud and
clear from the front page
of every newspaper, the
fact the Union did not take
this on it jaw-dropping.
Any institution is
measured, not by its
successes, but by its
failures. The Union and
the College did not do
enough, as a whole, in
this case, and the results
are clear. Whether or not
individuals are to blame
is a moot point: there
were many people who
could have intervened,
and didn’t, and there are
many people at fault. This
alumna’s experience sends
out extremely concerning
messages about how
sexual violence is dealt
with at Imperial, and
whether those in positions
of responsibility can real
deal with it – how could
this have happened?

Students support TEF but fear medal system will have
negative impact on graduate prospects

Concerns remain over
the way teaching
quality is assessed as
value of student input
is slashed by half.
Joanna Wormald
Deputy Editor
S
tudents largely
agree with the
principle of the
Teaching Excel-
lence Framework (TEF)
but are less convinced
about the way it is
currently implemented,
according to a survey
commissioned by a
consortium of student
unions, including Impe-
rial College Union.
The Teaching excel-
lence: the student perspec-
tive report analysed data
from a survey of 8,994
students from 123 higher
education institutions. It
found 84% of students
agreed universities should
be encouraged to provide
excellent teaching. This
is the driving idea behind
TEF, which uses three
metrics to judge teaching
quality and give univer-
sities a gold, silver, or
bronze rating.
The current method-
ology considers graduate
prospects, drop-out rates,
and NSS scores. More
than half of students
favoured their feedback
being used to evaluate
teaching. However, the
weighting given to NSS
scores will be halved in
the third year of TEF. This
means student feedback
will be “significantly less
important” in future TEF
rankings.
When asked to rank
factors that demonstrate
excellent teaching,
graduate outcomes came
bottom. While 68% of
students said universities
should be responsible
if teaching is “not good
enough to enable them to
succeed”, only 34% be-
lieved universities should
be held to account if job
rates are low. Just 18%
agree universities should
be accountable when stu-
dents drop out.
The vast majority of
respondents said the TEF
should also consider IT
facilities, library services,
and course-specific re-
sources.
Most students were
in favour of the medal
ranking system but 3 in 5
were against linking TEF
ratings to tuition fees.
Under initial plans, uni-
versities with a gold would
be able to increase their
tuition fees in line with
inflation. However this
has since been impeded
by Conservative plans to
freeze tuition fees in a bid
to win over young voters
(Felix 1670).
Problems remain with
the medal system. Half of
students would reconsider
or not apply to their current
university if it had a bronze
rating. For gold-rated uni-
versities, 6% of students
would reconsider or not
apply. This varied by
ethnicity: BAME students
were twice as likely not to
apply to a gold-rated uni-
versity compared to white
students.
There were also fears
that the rating of a univer-
sity could harm graduate
prospects. Students were
concerned employers
would look more favour-
ably on someone with a
2:1 from a gold- or sil-
ver-rated university than
someone with a first from
a bronze-rated university.
Furthermore, variation
across departments could
lead to gold-rated univer-
sities running bronze-rated
courses and vice versa.
The Union said: “We’re
pleased to have worked
in partnership with over
20 other students’ unions
to gain an insight into
what students think of
the Teaching Excellence
Framework, and we’re
proud that our research
is having a real impact
on the debate within the
higher education sector.
We look forward to raising
the findings with College
through our Academic
Representation Network,
highlighting the impor-
tance students place on
teaching excellence and
the quality of resources,
rather than employment
rates, when deciding if
college has met their ex-
pectations.”
TEF ratings released
earlier this year caused
controversy when several
Universities minister Jo Johnson announced further TEF
changes// Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
Employers
may prefer
candidates
with a 2:1
from a gold- or
silver-rated
university than
someone with
a first from a
bronze-rated
university.
A consultation pub-
lished in September 2016
revealed concerns that
using graduate prospects
would disadvantage uni-
versities offering courses
in fields such as creative
arts, where “highly-skilled
employment” is less
common. This would
also be the case where
graduates take a gap year
or work in lower-level
jobs before gaining high-
ly-skilled employment.
The report also revealed
an “associated risk” of uni-
versities accepting fewer
women, ethnic minorities,
and people from disadvan-
taged backgrounds on to
their courses in order to
achieve a higher graduate
employment rating.
Non-continuations
are more commonly the
result of university-re-
lated factors other than
teaching quality. An “un-
intended consequence”
of the non-continuance
metric was also noted:
universities may reduce
the number of students
who are “less likely to
succeed” or make courses
less demanding in order
to improve retention. So
the metric is not strongly
linked to teaching quality
and will potentially lead to
accepting only privileged
candidates that are more
likely to succeed. But the
measure remains, with the
government insisting that
non-continuation rates are
“a good proxy for student
engagement”.
Student satisfaction is
useful in reflecting teach-
ing quality so long as data
from the “teaching on my
course” questions of the
National Student Survey
are used rather than
overall satisfaction rates.
Problems here are largely
to do with lower satis-
faction scores awarded
to female and ethnic mi-
nority academics. Not to
worry though: government
analysis insists there is no
significant relationship
between the proportion
of female academics and
satisfaction scores and
only a “very small” rela-
tionship regarding ethnic
minorities.
Russell Group universities
were given bronze ratings.
Imperial was one of eight
Russell Group universities
that achieved gold status.
At the time, Imperial
provost Professor James
Stirling said: “Excellence
in education is at the
very heart of our mission.
Our teaching must be
as innovative, agile and
world-leading as our
research.”
The survey was con-
ducted by trendence UK
and gathered quantitative
and qualitative data from
undergraduate and post-
graduate students.
Universities are keen
Unintended consequences
to achieve high TEF
scores, since many feel
they are attractive to po-
tential students. However,
six universities have
recently been reprimanded
by the Advertising Stand-
ards Authority (ASA) over
unsubstantiated claims in
their marketing materials.
Leicester University,
Falmouth University,
Teesside University, East
Anglia University, the
University of Strathclyde,
and the University of
West London were all
instructed to remove
misleading material from
their websites, implying
that universities were
leaders in specifc subjects
or regions.
