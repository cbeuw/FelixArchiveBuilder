P
eople & Planet
has released
its university
league tables,
which show Imperial
College London is
among the worst higher
education institutions in
the country in terms of
sustainability and envi-
ronmental policy.
Imperial was placed
141st
out of 154 higher
education providers in
this year’s league tables,
making it the worst-per-
forming university in
the Russell Group. It
achieved an overall score
of 18.5%, which is a
‘Failed’ rating. In contrast,
Manchester Metropolitan
University, which topped
the table, scored 77.6%,
and the London School of
Economics, which came
highest of the Russell
Group, scored 64.4%.
The league tables,
which have been running
for ten years, take a
number of metrics into
account when deciding the
rankings, largely centred
around what environmen-
tal and ethical policy the
university has in place,
and the amount of support
environmental initiatives
have on campus. Half the
information is gathered
from publically available
sources, while half is from
data published by other
agencies.
and scored zero on envi-
ronmental policy, ethical
investment, education, and
water reduction. It scored
highest in environmental
auditing and management
systems, and sustainable
food.
Rhidian Thomas, Impe-
rial College Union’s Ethics
and Environment Officer,
called the results “at once
both breathtakingly poor
and entirely fair”, saying
that “College’s chummy
relationship with the
fossil fuel industry is an
ugly stain on its academic
record – coupled with
its continued pursuit of
energy-intensive expan-
sion, there’s no wonder
it did so badly”. He went
on to tell Felix he was
“hugely proud of the
Union’s decision to back
divestment last year”, and
looked forward to “the day
when College too finds the
moral conviction to put its
money where its mouth
is”.
The student group
Divest Imperial, which
campaigns for Imperial to
stop investment in oil and
gas companies, called the
results “appalling, espe-
cially for a ‘world-leading’
institution which markets
itself on global outlook,
sustainability and envi-
ronmental responsibility”.
It said that for many stu-
dents the results would be
“unsurprising”, given that
“the constant, visible pres-
ence of environmentally
and societally damaging
companies is simply a fact
of life on campus”.
People & Planet report-
ed that Imperial has no
current policy on ethical
investments, and accepted
nearly £24 million in do-
nations from the fossil fuel
industry between 2009-
2014. Imperial reportedly
has nearly £9 million
currently invested in the
fossil fuel industry, in-
cluding nearly £2 million
in Statoil, £300,000 in BP,
and £1.5 million in Shell
– nearly double what was
invested in the previous
year.
Divest Imperial said
the fossil fuel industries
“seem woven into the
fabric of university,
blatantly contradicting the
aims of the College, and
undermining the research
into renewables and
climate change undertak-
en here”. The group set up
a stall the Thursday after
the results were released,
asking Imperial students
and staff to guess where
the university had placed.
Sustainable Development
(ESD) was another metric
in which Imperial fared
badly, scoring zero. People
& Planet describe ESD as
“working with students to
encourage them to con-
sider what the concept of
global citizenship means
in the context of their
own discipline”, as well
as encouraging thinking
about ethical issues and
developing “a future-fac-
ing outlook”. According to
People & Planet, Imperial
lacks any form of frame-
work or strategy for ESD.
Imperialhasanumberof
departments dedicated to
sustainability and climate
change, including the
Centre for Environmental
Policy and the Grantham
Institute for Climate
Change. It also states on
the website they “recog-
nise the effect that [our]
operations and activities
have on the environment”,
and “seek to establish an
ethos at all levels and in
all departments towards
protecting and improving
the environment”.
However, out of a total
community of staff and
students numbering more
than 13,000, Imperial only
employs a single senior
staff member responsible
for sustainability. People
& Planet also failed to find
evidenceofanannually-re-
viewed, publicly-available
environmental policy, or
sustainability goals in a
number of areas, including
community involvement
and biodiversity.
One Imperial academic
said that they were “not
at all surprised” about
Imperial’s results in the
league tables. They told
Felix: “It’s about time
the College takes this as
seriously as the other 140
universities ahead of us in
the table. We’re not only
missing a trick, we’re
beginning to look like an
unashamed laughing stock
of penny-pinching suits.”
In a statement, a College
representative said they
“recognise that we have a
responsibility to carry out
our mission sustainably
and to minimise the envi-
ronmental impact of our
operations”. They referred
to their “world-leading
research in energy, the
environment, and climate
change”, which produces
“fact-based reports that
advance the field, inform
the public, and contribute
to global policy”.
Divestment in fossil fuel
companies has become a
point of contention across
a number of UK campus-
es. The University of East
Anglia divested last week,
following a four-year
campaign by students and
activists.
Aside from the ethical
arguments against invest-
ing in fossil fuel compa-
nies, there is also the eco-
nomic threat of the ‘carbon
bubble’: current valuation
of fossil fuel companies
is based on the assump-
tion that all reserves will
be consumed, but it is
likely that international
agreements will limit the
amount of hydrocarbons
consumed. Mark Carney,
the Governor of the Bank
of England, has warned
about the “potentially
huge” threat this bubble
poses to investors.
The ranking of universi-
ties is carried out by People
& Planet throughout the
summer. Universities
have the opportunity to
appeal their score before
it is published. Sian Berry,
the Green Party politician
who came third in 2016’s
London mayoral race, said
that the rankings are “im-
portant for anyone – staff
member or student – who
want to improve their uni-
versity’s record on green
and ethical issues”.
“Imperial
placed
141st
of 154
universities,
making it
bottom of the
Russell Group”
This year’s results are a
sharp decline for Imperial,
which came 96th
in the pre-
vious version of the table,
and was 16th
out of the 24
Russell Group universities
in 2015. Imperial failed
to achieve a full score in
any of the metrics used,
“Divest
Imperial said
that the results
would be
'unsurprising'
for many
students and
staff”
Imperial also has a
large amount invested in
arms companies: it has
increased its endowment
fund investments in Lock-
heed Martin, for example,
which produces weapons
for drones, among other
products, from £1.3
million to £2.215 million.
