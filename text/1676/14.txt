The unbearable melancholy of Bojack Horseman
The creators of Bojack Horseman have never been afraid to ask difficult questions and explore complex topics. In
its fourth season, however, they double-down on this, in an examination of the cyclical, inter-generational nature
of trauma. It’s the show’s most difficult season to date, but ends with a glimmer of hope.
“The take-
home message
is that trauma
is often
cyclical, and
psychic scars
generational”
T
he third season of
Bojack Horseman
ended with the
question of
whether our problematic
protagonist would ever
be able to move on.
Following the death of
his co-star and on-screen
daughter Sarah Lynn
during their drug binge,
Bojack sets off in his car,
driving far away from
those he has let down.
Ramming his foot down on
the accelerator and taking
his hands off the wheel, he
drifts along the road, until
he sees something that
makes him slam on the
break: a group of horses
running through the open
plains. They are able to
do something that Bojack
has been unable to – they
are moving forward, into
the future. Soundtracked
by the haunting vocals of
Nina Simone singing her
heartbreaking ‘Stars’, it
felt like a culmination of
three seasons in which
Bojack and his fellow
Hollywoo characters had
been circling around the
same ideas of desperation.
Season 4 of Bojack
Horseman sees the
majority of the characters
breaking new ground
– Princess Carolyn is
looking into the possibility
of balancing her personal
and professional lives,
taking on a new boyfriend,
as well as her new role
as a manager (the incom-
prehensible difference
between an agent and a
manager is a running gag
throughout the season);
Todd is coming to terms
with his asexuality, and
learning to make peace
with who he is; and Mr
Peanutbutter and Diane
are trying to work through
the issues in their relation-
ship amid a gubernatorial
race – but for Bojack, this
season will explore the
root of his cyclical behav-
iour, reaching further back
into the past than it has
him, and the reasons
behind his personality.
The take-home message:
trauma is often cyclical,
and psychological scars
can be generational.
Following on from
the first episode, marked
by a distinctive lack of
Bojack, we get him back
in the next one. In “The
Old Sugarman Place”
he begins expunging the
ghosts of his past, begin-
ning with his toxic rela-
tionship with his mother;
Beatrice Horseman (neé
Sugarman) is an emotion-
ally-manipulative bully,
who traumatised Bojack
both physically and
mentally, but “The Old
Sugarman Place” takes us
back to her childhood, and
things begin to become
clear. A brother dying in
the war sends her mother,
Honey, into a spiral of
grief, which is ‘cured’ by
the stalwart of American
mid-century psychiatry: a
frontotemporal lobotomy,
robbing Honey of any
personality or vitality.
“Love does things to a
person, terrible things.”
she advises, “Beatrice,
promise me you’ll never
love anyone as much as I
loved Crackerjack.”
debutante who feels stifled
under her father’s author-
ity, she skips town with
Bojack’s father, a lover of
the Beats who is planning
on writing ‘the great
American novel’. Looking
after Bojack crushes her
younger self’s dreams,
and – with her mother’s
advice ringing in her head
– it’s no surprise that she
treats him so terribly.
Whether this cycle can
be broken is a question
raised by the arrival into
the show of Hollyhock,
who believes Bojack is
her illegitimate father.
Aparna Nancherla does
sterling voice-work as
Hollyhock, bringing a
vulnerability and likea-
bility to the role, and she
immediately fits into the
Bojack universe. While
Bojack has never shied
away from conversations
around mental health, this
season develops the topic,
looking at the heritability
of mental illness: while
Hollyhock would provide
a meaning for Bojack’s
life, she also serves as a

BOJACK HORSEMAN:
SEASON 4
ever gone before.
For the last three
seasons, we have only seen
what Bojack’s formative
years were like in passing,
but over the course of these
twelve episodes we get a
much clearer look into the
environment that formed
Mr Peanutbutter running for Union President // Netflix
“Aparna
Nancherla
does sterling
voice-work
as Hollyhock,
bringing a
vulnerability
and likability
to the role”
It’s a hard episode
to watch, and Bojack
Horseman’s creators dou-
ble-down with the penul-
timate episode, “Time’s
Arrow”, which lets us
into Beatrice’s demen-
tia-addled mind, filling
in the gaps between her
childhood and her mother-
hood. A Barnard-educated
“‘Ruthie’is one
of the greatest
episodes of
Bojack thus
far – a huge
achievement”
“Amy Sedaris
is doing some
of the best
work of her
career, and her
performance is
one of the best
on current TV”
reminder that he manages
to taint everything he
touches – above all his
relationships with others.
This season is probably
the most difficult season to
watch of Bojack thus far,
something that is aided
and abetted by some of
the experiments in style
tried by the creators: in
two episodes, we get
a markedly different
animation style as the
writers let us into the
minds of the characters.
In “Stupid Piece of Sh*t”
Bojack’s own negative
thoughts are expressed
as jagged scribbles, as
we spend some time in
his claustrophobic head,
drawn down by cycles of
negative thoughts and im-
pulsive behaviours. Later
on, in “Time’s Arrow”,
Beatrice’s dementia is rep-
resented through rifts in
reality, with backgrounds
fading in and out, char-
acters’ faces left blank or
scrawled out, and words
rearranging themselves.
The zany nature of
the world of Hollywoo
usually serves as a balm
for some of the rawer
aspects of Bojack, but
this aspect is somewhat
lacking in this season.
West coast navel-gazing
is explored through Mr
Peanutbutter running for
governor of California – a
plot line that culminates
in the episode “Under-
ground”, which sees
Jessica Biel (described
as an “attempted movie
star”) setting fire to Zach
Braff after Mr Peanutbut-
ter and Diane’s house falls
into a sinkhole generated
by fracking. These serve
political issues like gun
control can seem a little
pasted-on: when Diane
sparks a debate about gun
control in “Thoughts and
Prayers” it isn’t given
enough time to develop
from the personal to the
public.
Todd’s storyline
develops little throughout
the season, although since
the main theme is self-ac-
ceptance, it is unsurprising
that this is the case. His arc
does manage to introduce
another of his schemes in
the latter half of the season:
clown dentists, who
provide enough material
to generate running gags
for a good six episodes.
Other than these
aspects, the remaining
characters experience an
unremittingly bleak time
of it. The cracks in Mr
Peanutbutter and Diane’s
relationship – both literal
and metaphorical – begin
to really show through,
prompting the question of
whether their differences
compliment each other,
or make them intrinsically
incompatible. As usual,
Alison Brie and Paul F.
Tomkins deliver great
voice work, with Brie in
particular impressing this
season. Her drink-induced
breakdown comes around
half way through the
season, but time can’t heal
all wounds, and we end
with another argument,
one that has Brie and
Tomkins breaking through
their characters’ façades –
emotionally repressed for
Diane, and glibly unaware
for Mr Peanutbutter – to
deliver emotionally-hon-
est performances.
None of the plot lines,
however, can match
Princess Carolyn’s, as she
attempts to settle down
with Ralph Cheeseman.
Over the previous seasons
of Bojack, we’ve come to
know Princess Carolyn
as a character defined by
her strong work-ethic and
can-do attitude; as she
unleashed the revelation
last season that she felt
she had wasted her youth
on Bojack, she comes into
this season attempting to
claw back some of what
she feels she has missed.
Things, naturally, don’t
pan out, leading to one
of the most emotional-
ly-crippling episodes of
the season: “Ruthie”,
in which we are taken
through one of the worst
days in Princess Carolyn’s
life. She begins the day
pregnant, in a loving re-
lationship, and in control
of her business, but ends
it with nothing – not
even her precious family
heirloom, or at least the
idea behind it, is safe from
the harsh realities of life.
Even the framing device,
which gave us some hope
for Princess Carolyn’s
future, is whipped away
at the last minute, as the
screen cuts to black. It’s
not only one of the season
stand-outs, but one of the
best episodes of Bojack
thus far – a huge achieve-
ment when you consider
the strengths of some
previous episodes.
Amy Sedaris is doing
some of the best work
of her career, and this
season elevates her per-
formance into one of the
best currently on TV. Her
performance in “Ruthie”
is emotionally devastat-
ing, and she absolutely
deserves an Emmy nod for
it during awards season.
She also manages to get
her mouth around some
serious tongue-twisters –
example: “Portnoy finds
joy in hoi polloi boy toy!”
– of which there are a
couple in each episode on
average.
Her performance
is complemented by a
number of newcomers
to the Bojack universe:
Andre Braugher is mag-
nificent as the incumbent
governor Woodchuck
Coodchuck-Berkowitz;
Jane Krakowski, who
has emerged as one of
the stand-out stars of
Unbreakable Kimmy
Schmidt, is fantastic as
Honey Sugarman; and
Wendie Malick manages
to take us through the
entirety of Beatrice Sugar-
man’s adult development,
from optimistic teenager
to embittered mother, and
through to cantankerous
care-home resident, in one
of the strongest perfor-
mances of the season.
But while the season
might be one of the
bleakest seasons of
Bojack yet, it also feels
like the most confused:
previous seasons managed
to maintain a perfect
balance between humour
and tragedy, but there
are certain episodes of
season four that don’t
really seem to work, par-
ticularly when they follow
on from the gut-punches
Bojack-creator Raphael
Bob-Waksberg is so adept
at delivering.
In some ways, this
season was very much
needed: all the major
characters are left, if not in
a better place emotionally,
then in a more truthful
position, setting things up
for another strong season.
Despite so much time
spent examining his past,
the character who seems
to move on the most
is Bojack himself. The
season ends on a hopeful
note – the most optimistic
in the show’s history –
suggesting that, maybe
this time, the cycle can be
broken, once and for all.
