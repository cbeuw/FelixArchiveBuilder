Imperial Immortals face surprising and frustrating
defeat
T
he Imperial
Immortals came
out strong in our
second game of
the season. During the first
quarter of game we were
pushing the University
of East Anglia’s defence
back, making them work
for first downs. As the
game carried on, however,
the Imperial Immortals’
injuries grew, and – with
our small squad size for
the game – this made it
difficult for us to structure
ourselves.
Amongst our injured
players was Francisco
“what’s a training session”
Costa who, after only a
few training sessions, was
able to make great tackles,
stopping two UEA touch-
downs. Fran did his best to
keep up with the automatic
adjustments and coverages
at every play, but was un-
fortunately taken off after
his second head injury of
our offense had good
improvement, making a
lot more yards than we
made against Kent, as our
rookie-heavy offense gets
used to the triple option
style of play.
A big congratulation to
Michael “Alex Moran”
Urashima for stepping up
to the role of quarterback
after our first string QB
rolled his ankle. Michael
had great play awareness
and avoided tackles left
right and centre, trying to
make the right read and
follow the play. Being
only a rookie, this level
of skill really caught the
coach’s attention – he was
able to pull off great plays,
all without wearing red
jeans.
Dan “handsome Dan”
Grumberg won line MVP
this game for his consist-
ency and leadership on the
O-line. Dan made sure the
rest of the line was aware
of the plays at every point,
and always managed to
execute when making
crucial blocks to protect
the plays.
Once again Harry
“floodgates” Lawrence
was able to win overall
MVP, making plays for
both offence, defence,
and special teams. Harry
scored our only touch-
down from a great return
at special teams, and he
didn’t even need Fran
to score first this time.
Harry gave his all on the
field and really proved his
value to the coaches and
the team. The final score
of the game was 33-6 to
UEAPirates – a frustrating
loss for the Immortals that
was not expected. We will
improve upon this score
and show other teams we
are to be taken as a serious
contender from this
season, as we were before.

Publicity Officer
Their rookie-heavy squad is improving, especially the offense, but faced stiff competition from the UEA Pirates.
“As the game
carried on,
the Imperial
Immortals’
injuries grew,
and – with our
small squad
– this made it
difficult”
the game. In the end, after
a few lucky breaks and
some good plays, the UEA
offence put up 33 points
against our defence.
On a positive note
