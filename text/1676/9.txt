I
n his second longest
play, Shakespeare
chronicles the
election to, and sub-
sequent removal from, the
position of consul – a mag-
istrate wielding executive
power – of Caius Martius
Coriolanus, played here
by Sope Dirisu.
Coriolanus is elected to
consul by his fellow soci-
etal-elites: a war hero and
defender of the city from
the neighbouring Vols-
cians, Coriolanus is, in
their eyes, the epitome of
the perfect Roman citizen.
Not so to the common
folk – the plebeians –
who despise Coriolanus
and attempt to block his
appointment to the senate
through their tribunes.
The play is one of Shake-
speare’s most complex
works, juggling numerous
motifs from class war to
the relationship between
mother and son, all with
the noticeable absent of
soliloquises – so often an
audience’s insight into the
minds of Shakespeare’s
characters.
With no running com-
mentary on Coriolanus’s
thoughts, the task of
inhabiting the title role
becomes considerably
more difficult, but it is
one Dirisu steps up to.
He commands the stage
with an presence that is
palpable from the stalls,
instilling fear, awe, or joy
when the moment is right.
His speeches are delivered
with suitable emotion
while avoiding becoming
hammy and taking his
RSC debut in his stride.
Crucially, Dirisu avoids
portraying Coriolanus
definitively as an anti-hero
or a villain. Instead, Cori-
olanus’s merits and flaws
are left for the audience
to weigh, like any good
electorate should.
The performances from
the rest of the cast range
from good to exceptional.
James Corrigan struggles
in the first half of the play
as Tullus Aufidius – head
of the Volscian army –
but his relationship with
Coriolanus in the latter
half is executed well, and
provides one of the pro-
duction’s most engaging
scenes.
Paul Jesson embodies
Mennenius with a Bri-
an-Blessed-esque level of
joviality, while Hannah
Morrish as Virgilia –
Martius’s wife – performs
her role beautifully on the
fringes of the action as
‘the strong, silent type’ to
quote Tony Soprano. And
Katherine Toy’s small role
as Valeria provides superb
comic relief.
Production value is
also excellent. The quick
scene changes, from min-
imalistic urban squalor
to equally minimalistic,
but ever more polished,
luxurious Roman living
quarters provide a note-
worthy juxtaposition
between the rich and poor.
All of which is rounded
off with composer Mira
Calix’s score and Alexan-
dra Ferrari’s operatic aria
to compliment the play’s
defining moments with
tingling beauty.
The star of the show
howeverisHaydnGwynne
as Volumnia, Coriolanus’s
mother. Gwynne, in con-
junction with Dirisu, plays
out the most intriguing
and complex mother-son
relationship in any
Shakespeare play, Hamlet
included. Volumnia makes
no secret of her influence
on Coriolanus and her
desire to paint him as a
war hero to appease the
plebeians. On hearing
of Coriolanus return to
the city after battle, she
remarks “O he is wounded;
I thank the gods for’t.”
Her power awards her the
stage’s best real estate,
with Volumnia occupying
its centre whenever she
speaks, displacing even
Coriolanus.
It is here, in the
moments mother and son
spend together, when the
adaptation comes into its
own. No truer is this than
in Act V Scene III, where
an outcast Coriolanus –
having vowed to destroy
Rome with the Volscians
and take revenge on the
plebeians – is begged
by Virgilia and his son
to return home in peace.
When neither wife nor
child can convince
Coriolanus, the task is
left to his mother. After
pleading with and begging
her child to forgive the
city, Volumnia takes
Coriolanus’s hand and
the pair fall into silence.
Perhaps ironically for
Shakespeare, it is not
the role of a speech or a
soliloquy to provide the
play’s most critical and
emotional moment, but
the stage direction that
follows Volumnia’s plea:
He holds her hand, silent.
Coriolanus breaks down
and succumbs, once again,
to his mother’s will. His
lust for revenge vanishes
as quickly as it arrived.
As with Dirisu, Gwynne
gives the audience enough
materialto form an opinion
on Volumnia, without dic-
tating their feelings. We’re
never quite sure if Volum-
nia’s motives are that of
an overbearing mother,
desperate to see her son
achieve is full potential, or
a puppet-master attempt-
ing to realise he own lust
for power through her son.
Regardless of her
motives, her plans
ultimately fall flat, as
Coriolanus is killed by
Aufidius in the final scene.
Sadly, it is here where the
play itself falls flat. Angus
Jackson, the director, and
production team have
made much in the run-up
to opening night of the
fittingness of Coriolanus
in the modern political
landscape. Here we have
a would-be political leader
who cares not for pan-
dering to the electorate,
instead insisting ‘Action
is eloquence’; a tactic that,
despite its honourability,
bears no fruit. Fitting
indeed, in a ‘post-truth’
world, where populism
seems to reign supreme.
But the production
fails – if you will allow
the reviewer – to breath
enough breathlessness
into Shakespeare’s text at
the key political moments.
The play’s opening riot
scene feels disjointed from
the rest of the play, and
Coriolanus’s death – the
only in the play – is far too
muted to make jaws drop.
Coriolanus sets out to
provide an on-the-pulse
commentary of current
affairs, but comes up short.
Instead, the play shines in
its character development.
From bit-parts to the roles
of Volumnia and Corio-
lanus himself, the actors
shine and give the play
an abundance of soul that
could touch even the most
hardened of war-heroes.
Coriolanus runs to

MMXVII season runs until

Politics and the value of rhetoric in early Rome
The Barbican opens its Rome MMXVII season with the seldom performed myth of Coriolanus. An attempt to hold
a mirror to the current world of politics falls flat, but the characters shine through.
