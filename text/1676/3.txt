"ICU did not
recommend
removing the
perpetrator
from his
position of
authority, since
he was not in
that role at
the time of the
assault"
David’s position was not
“an enabling factor” for
the sexual assault – re-
ferred to by the investiga-
tor as “sexual harassment”
– partially because he was
not in the role when it took
place.
The investigator rec-
ommended reprimanding
David, banning him from
licensed Union premises
and requiring him to
demonstrate he is manag-
ing his drinking, as well as
attending a consent work-
shop. He did not, however,
recommend removing him
as president.
“Ireadtherecommenda-
tions and immediately felt
faint. I couldn’t believe a
months-long investigation
could result in a mere slap
on the wrist,” Helen said.
“The focus on drinking
was irrelevant and offen-
sive, as it suggests that
[the perpetrator's] alcohol
consumption was to blame
for his actions.”
Helen has appealed the
recommendations, and is
awaiting a decision by the
Governance Committee.
§
The Union’s constitu-
tion states that one of their
reasons for existence is
to promote the “welfare
of students at Imperial
College London”. While
Helen is, as an alumna,
no longer a member of the
university or Union, her
experience sends a wor-
rying message about how
sexual misconduct cases
are dealt with. Since 2010,
the College has dealt with
at least eleven complaints
of sexual misconduct;
while the Union is unable
to provide official data on
how many cases they deal
with yearly, it is highly un-
likely that this is the first
case they have dealt with,
and more cases are likely
to occur.
The National Union of
Students (NUS) ‘Hidden
Marks’ report, carried
out in 2009-10, was the
country’s first nation-wide
report into women
students’ experience of
sexual harassment and
assault. The report made
for shocking reading:
one in seven women
students had experienced
serious sexual or physical
violence, and “many
women students struggle
to get through their course
without coming into to
contact with harassment
or violence in one form or
another.”
What was most signif-
icant, however, was the
low number of women
who report such incidents:
just 2% of victims of ‘less
serious sexual assault’,
and 4% of those who
had experienced ‘serious
sexual assault’ reported
it to their institution. A
Universities UK task-
force in 2015 found that
non-reporting can be the
women on campus; one
participant said Imperial’s
‘ingrained misogyny’
was “so deep that it had
become normal.”
For both the College
and the Union, there does
not appear to be an official
policy on sexual violence,
although they both list
sources of support on their
websites. While sexual
assault is covered by the
College’s Student Disci-
plinary Procedure, there
is no specific policy on it,
unlike, say, their policy on
harassment and bullying.
The closest the Union
comes to one is their Safe
Space Policy, which “aims
to create an environment
where all students, staff,
and visitors feel safe and
protected.” They told
Felix that their policy is
“clear that we encourage
reporting... and have a
zero-tolerance approach.”
There are clear steps
the College and the Union
could take to address the
issue of sexual violence:
Hareem Ghani, the
NUS National Women’s
Officer, has said that “as
university communities
we should respect the
leadership of the victim/
survivor in driving a
process that we support”,
while the Universities UK
taskforce concluded that
having effective reporting
mechanisms and well-
trained staff were key to
encouraging students to
come forward.
Fintan O’Connor,
Deputy President
(Welfare), has highlighted
the need for increased
support systems, telling
Felix that the Union “had
a duty to do better” earlier
on this term. The Union
has been working with the
College to secure funding
to develop a sexual vio-
lence support programme,
with six Sexual Violence
Liaison Officers being
trained – two of whom are
Union staff – scheduled to
beinplaceinJanuary.They
have also implemented
active bystander training.
In a statement to Felix, a
Union representative said
that they acknowledged
“there is more that the
Union and College can
do to reduce the risk of
incidents occurring and
to increase support for
victims”. They will be
reviewing this case during
their governance review
this year. A College rep-
resentative told Felix that
they will be “consulting
with groups who special-
ise in supporting victims
of sexual assault or rape”,
to ensure they can offer
“the best support possible
to students”.
§
Coming forward is one
thing, but the experience
that follows is another.
The recent spate of
high-profile cases brought
against those in power –
both in Hollywood and
Westminster – coupled
with the sense of solidar-
ity that campaigns such
as #MeToo generate, have
resulted in more victims
coming forward. But this
is only half the battle:
students, staff, and alumni
need to know that their ex-
periences will be listened
to and acted upon.
While Helen – like
many other women – has
let countless instances of
sexual harassment and
assaultslide,shehadprevi-
ously reported two sexual
assaults by strangers to the
police. Although there was
not sufficient evidence to
identify and prosecute the
perpetrators, she always
found the officers kind and
capable. One of the key
differences between how
the police and the Union
handled her cases was
having a reliable point of
contact on the police force
who she felt was on her
side, and always willing
to keep her informed of
progress.
“If I had known at the
beginning what my expe-
rience [with ICU] would
be like, I would have gone
to the police instead,”
she said. “The insincerity
and incompetence I en-
countered with the Union
was demoralising. What
troubled me most was
the thought of how many
other sexual abuse victims
at Imperial have surely
suffered similar treatment,
and conceivably even
had their cases buried by
negligence.”
An organisation is
not best judged on its
successes, but on its
failures. Helen’s experi-
ence represents a single
person’s experience, but
even that is one too many
when one considers the
impact of such cases.
“Unless the Union can
demonstrate they are able
to handle sexual abuse
cases efficiently, fairly,
and supportively,” she
tells me, “it is clear to me
that it should not take on
this responsibility.”

After reporting her sexual assault, Helen's experience was defined by miscommunication, lack of a reliable point of
contact, and absence of support.

“Helen says
that her
experience
pushed her
back into a
suicidal state”
several emails to the staff
members she’d been in
touch with.
These periods of radio
silence continued through-
out the investigation.
When she heard back from
the College, they said the
case had been passed on to
another staff member, who
then informed her it had
been passed back to the
Union. She then waited
more than six weeks for a
Union staff member – who
had been assigned to lead
the investigation – to get in
touch, asking for another
statement. Even when the
investigation was drawing
to a close, she experienced
a period of two weeks in
which she tried repeatedly
to get in touch with the
investigator, with no
success.
“I spent most of this
time in complete despair.
The most painful times
were when I knew [the
perpetrator] was enjoying
events which I stayed
away from, out of fear that
I would come across him,”
Helen said. “The other
overwhelming feeling
was of isolation. I had no
reliable contact and would
go weeks hearing nothing.
I was consumed with the
case, while nobody re-
sponsible for it seemed to
care, or even acknowledge
it. This made me feel my
grip on reality was slip-
ping.”
Helen has a severe,
long-term mental health
condition which intensifies
emotional pain, requiring
her to go to hospital every
week for treatment. “I’ve
built up resilience, but
this experience pushed me
back into a suicidal state.
At times, I was barely
able to sleep or work,” she
said. “Absurdly, the sexual
assault investigation was
more distressing than the
sexual assault itself.”
Throughout the inves-
tigation, there was also a
complete lack of certainty
about when it might come
to an end. Given that
Helen raised the complaint
after finding out the perpe-
trator may be in a position
of authority once the aca-
demic year began, it was
vital to her that the case
concluded before then.
For many freshers, this is
their first time living away
from home, and it can be
a period of great vulnera-
bility.
Even after a sabbatical
officer – who Helen had
approached for help – had
notified the investigator of
the effect the investigation
was having on her mental
health, the investigation
did not pick up pace. The
expected finishing date
was pushed back again and
again: at the end ofAugust,
she was told it would con-
clude by mid-September;
but when this date passed,
she was told to expect a
resolution by the month’s
end; this date, too, passed,
and the deadline shifted to
the middle of October, by
which point the Freshers’
Fair had been and gone.
A Union representative
told Felix that investiga-
tions are “often sensitive
and complex”, meaning
they “take a long time to
reach an outcome”. They
said that “a lengthy period
of investigation can add to
the distress experienced,
and we apologise that this
hasrecentlybeenthecase”.
While the College has said
“it would not be right” to
comment on a specific
case, a College spokesper-
son told Felix “we deeply
regret if anyone feels that
an investigation of sexual
assault or harassment has
not been handled by the
College with the urgency
it warrants... we will seek
to learn from this experi-
ence.”
§
What caused these
delays? One clear problem
was the gathering of
witness statements.
Helen was able to name
four individuals (not
including the perpetrator)
who might have seen
what happened, and their
testimonies had to be
collected independently.
This process continued for
months, and not a single
person involved was able
to submit a statement
without some miscommu-
nication. During this time,
Helen was forced to act as
intermediary, being asked
to contact the witnesses
herself.
“Coordinating the
witness statements was
extremely frustrating,”
Helen said. “I would have
a period of silence, then a
period of being pelted with
contradictory messages.
Nothing made sense, and
I wondered if I was being
lied to. I felt completely
out of control.”
One witness, Emily,
first reached out to the
College at the beginning
of June, voicing her
concern at not having been
contacted, and offering to
supply a statement. The
College replied to her the
next day, saying that they
would be in touch with
her shortly, but she never
heard from them. She
only managed to provide a
statement to the Union in
mid-September. Another
witness, Nick, a graduate,
was first contacted in June,
but in mid-September the
investigator told Helen
that he had not been in
contact with him; it was
not until late September
that he was able to provide
a statement. At the end
of August, the Union’s
investigator told Helen
that he had been in contact
with another witness,
Paul; just over two weeks
later she was told that Paul
had not been in touch.
A few days later, Paul
confirmed to Helen that he
had been in touch with the
Union, but the investigator
continued to deny that this
was the case: receipt of
his statement was never
acknowledged.
Despite the investiga-
tion being passed to the
Union in June, and Helen
being told in August
that the investigator was
awaiting a statement from
the perpetrator with an
imminent, hard deadline,
it was not until October
that David’s statement was
taken.
The key witness,
John, was first contacted
towards the end of June.
An initial meeting with
the Union was cancelled,
and over the next month
he sent five emails to the
investigator and visited
the Union offices in
person three times, with
no response. After provid-
ing a witness statement, he
waited nearly two months
to hear a response, during
which he emailed the
investigator another five
times.
When concerns were
raised over this lack of
contact, the Union cited
issues with data protection
that prevented them from
reaching out to witnesses,
saying that they had not
been given explicit per-
mission by the College to
use the email addresses.
Imperial College Union
does not have its own
data protection policy, and
operates under College
policy; the decision to
delay contacting witnesses
was one reached by the two
organisations. The data
protection concern they
raised, however, related to
contacting alumni, while
John and most of the
other witnesses were still
students at the time the
complaint was raised.

The Union investigation
provisionally concluded at
the end of October, more
than nine months after
the assault occurred, and
seven months on from
when Helen first reported
it. During that time, her
case had been bounced
between at least half a
dozen people, from the
Union to the College and
back again. The investi-
gator found that “on the
balance of probabilities,
the allegations [made by
Helen] are true,” but that
