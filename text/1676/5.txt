called for corporation

S
ir James Dyson
has said the UK
should “walk
away” from
Brexit negotiations, as
the possibility of a ‘no-
deal’ Brexit becomes
more likely.
Sir Dyson, who gave
his name to Imperial’s
Dyson School of Design
Engineering, made his
comments on BBC One’s
Andrew Marr Show
last Sunday. He said
the problems facing the
government were due to
“the people we are nego-
tiating with”, saying that
“demanding billions and
billions to leave” – the
Brexit divorce bill – was
“outrageous”.
He went on to say it
should be easier to hire
and fire workers, and
argued that corporation tax
should be “eliminated”,
adding “there are ways of
getting around paying it...

mperial College
London has been
praised for its ap-
proach to cheating,
amid rising concerns of
Imperial praised for its approach to cheating
plagiarism.
Writing for the Times
Higher Education, barris-
ter and Imperial alumnus
Dr Daniel Sokol lamented
the low standard of proof
required to convict stu-
dents of cheating. A guide
by the Quality Assurance
Agency for Higher Educa-
tion published last month
recommends verdicts be
decided on the balance
of probabilities. This is
the standard used in civil
court cases and means
students are found guilty
if it is deemed it is more
likely than not that they
had cheated.
Imperial implements a
higher standard of proof,
requiring guilt to be estab-
lished beyond a reasonable
doubt – the same standard
required in criminal trials.
The QAA says this may be
appropriate given the seri-
ousness of the offence but
could also “be too strict to
enable effective decision
making”.
Dr Sokol has urged
more universities to
follow this “enlightened
approach”. He argues that
although some guilty stu-
dents may get away with
cheating due to this high
standard, it also means that
fewer innocent students
are likely to be convicted.
He told Felix: “Some
universities say that
students are much more
likely to give [cheating]
a go because there’s less
chance of being convict-
ed, but I haven’t seen any
evidence of that.” He also
argues the consequences
of expelling an innocent
student – such as reduced
job prospects and emo-
tional and mental distress
– are more serious than
dishonest students achiev-
ing a better grade.
Universities and science
minister Jo Johnson
last month warned the
seriousness of cheating
“should not be underesti-
mated”. Contract cheating
– where students pay
somebody else to write
their essays – is on the rise,
with one essay-writing
company reporting a 20%
increase in UK customers
over the past two years.
Earlier this week, Ohio
State University accused
83 students of cheating
by using messaging app
GroupMe.
you should allow profits to
be reinvested”.
The comments made by
Sir Dyson, who supported
Leave in the runup to the
referendum, provoked
debate online: Wes
Streeting, the Labour MP
for Ilford North, said on
Twitter: “No corporation
tax and firms able to hire
and fire at will. That’s
James Dyson’s vision for
Brexit Britain – and fami-
lies will pay the price.”
Imperial state their
Brexit approach will be
“pragmatic and positive”,
and they wish to “defend
our international values”.
Professor Alice Gast,
Imperial’s President, is a
member of the Mayor of
London’s Brexit Advisory
Group.ShemetwithDavid
Davis MP, Secretary of
State for Exiting the Eu-
ropean Union, and Sadiq
Khan, Mayor of London,
in September to discuss
the impact of Brexit on
higher education. Impe-
rial is campaigning for
continued access to the
EU’s research networks
post-Brexit. In an inter-
view with Le Monde this
week she said that the
prospect of Brexit was
worrying.
A Union representative
told Felix they “campaign
to protect the rights of all
our members, including
those from Europe and
further overseas”. They
said the Union will work
with College to “ensure
that Imperial remains a
welcoming and inclusive
environment for all, and
that our students remain
part of the international
scientific community”.
The Dyson School
of Design Engineering
was launched in 2015,
following a £12 million
donation from the James
Dyson Foundation. Sir
Dyson graduated from
the Royal College of Art,
and made his name with
bagless vacuum cleaners.
He is currently worth
around £7.8 billion. Dyson
products were formerly
made in Wiltshire, until
2002, when production of
vacuum cleaners moved
to Malaysia. This was fol-
lowed by the production
of washing machines in
2003.
A “no-deal” Brexit
describes what will
happen if the UK leaves
the EU without a formal
agreement in place. While
Prime Minister Theresa
May initially claimed “no
deal is better than a bad
deal”, this phrase has been
markedly absent in her
recent rhetoric. However,
she still admits that no
deal would be preferable.
A number of prominent
voices have disagreed:
Donald Tusk, President
of the European Council,
has said that “a no-deal
scenario would be bad for
everyone, but above all for
the UK”, while the Inter-
national Monetary Fund
has also said that a no-deal
Brexit would cause eco-
nomic damage to the UK
and the Eurozone. Kier
Starmer, Shadow Secre-
tary of State for Exiting
the European Union, told
the BBC Radio 4’s Today
programme that a no-deal
scenario is “unthinkable”,
and that “a responsible
government would allow
us to come to that place”.
Earlier this year, a joint
report by the University of
Sussex and the Resolution
Foundation thinktank
stated that the average
family would lose £260
a year, and predicted
increases in prices for
groceries and motor ve-
hicles. They argued that
these increases would hit
low-income households
hardest.
The UK is set to leave
the EU on 29th March
2019, two years after
invoking Article 50 of the
Treaty on the European
Union. May is currently
facing pressure from
within her own party on
Brexit, as Michael Gove
and Boris Johnson sent her
a letter earlier this week,
expressing their concerns
that “current preparations
are not proceeding with
anything like sufficient
energy.”
