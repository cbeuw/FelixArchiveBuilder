Have a sweet tooth? We sure do... CINAMMON ROLLS
You will need...
• 3 cups of flour
• 3 tsp. baking pow-
der
• 3 tbsp. sugar
• ½ tsp. salt
• ½ cups milk
• 2 tbsp. butter
• Peel from 1 orange
• 2 eggs
• 2 tsp. cinnamon - as
much cinnamon as
you can, actually
• ½ stick of butter at
room temperature
• Sugar
1. In a big bowl, mix all the dry ingredients
first until they are homogenous. In a separate
bowl slowly heat the milk, butter, and orange
peel until the butter is melted – you can use a
microwave for it, but remember to use a micro-
waveable bowl if this is the case.
2. Add the liquids to the dry ingredients. Add
the eggs – I normally beat them before actual-
ly adding them so the batter ends up nice and
smooth. Mix well until everything is incorporat-
ed.
3. Now, depending on the type of milk and
butter you are using, your mixture might not be
ready for the next step. If it’s too dry, add a bit of
milk; if not, add a bit of flour – it has to be solid
enough not to stick on your fingers, but not too
dry to start crumbling.
4. Let it rest for 10 minutes.
5. Roll the dough until you are happy with how
thick it is. If you make it thick, you are going
to have a fluffier cinnamon roll. If you make it
thinner, you are going to have more cinnamon.
It depends on what you want for your end result.
6. Spread the butter on the surface of the dough.
Try to make it as even as possible. Sprinkle the
sugar and then cover in cinnamon. If you can see
the dough through the cinnamon, you definitely
need to add more! Now roll!
7. If you want to want them now, just cut the
roll in slices that are 2-3 cm thick and bake them
for 20-25 mins at 175ºC (remember to add some
baking paper on the tray so you have less things
to clean afterwards). Or, you can save them for
the next morning - just make sure to use some
foil and keep them in the fridge over night. Pref-
erably, slice the roll in the morning.

all need our

heavily frowned upon

MICROWAVE BOWL
CAKE
You will need...
• 4 tbsp. of self-rais-
ing flour
• 4 tbsp. of chocolate
powder
• 4 tbsp. of milk
• 4 tbsp. of sugar
• 4 tbsp. of oil
• 1 egg
1. Mix well in one bowl and microwave for
5 mins.
2. Add a helping of ice-cream and dig in
while it’s still hot!
As for serving size of this recipe… well, I think
most cakes, regardless of size, only serve one.
If you’re backing away now because you see
tablespoons and you don’t have that thing in your
one-fork-and-one-spoon household, fear not! Just
use the simple quantitative skills that got you into
Imperial, aka ratios! Using the same measuring tool
(cups or spoons), measure out a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio of
flour, milk, sugar, oil, and chocolate powder.
This recipe is versatile: you can change the flavour
of the cake merely by substituting the chocolate
powder. For example, replace with matcha powder
for a green tea flavoured cake. You can also adjust
the consistency of the cake by changing the dry:wet
ingredient ratio. How exactly you do that I don’t
know, but putting that sentence in makes me sound
like I know what I’m doing.
PANCAKES,
PANCAKES,
PANCAKES!
You will need...
• 5 tbsp. of self-
raising flour
• 3 tbsp. of milk
• 2 tbsp. of sugar
• 1 egg
• Some butter
• A pinch of salt
1. Mix all ingredients well.
2. Place some butter in a heated pan.
3. Pour a spoonful of batter onto the pan.
4. Flip the pancake when the surface starts
to bubble.
5. Serve when both sides seem cooked
(solid, not watery). If you’re worried about
uncooked pancakes, try not to put too much
batter in the pan.
6. Add a slab of butter or drizzle some hon-
ey on top and dig in!
Serves 1, because you can never have too many
pancakes.
Add blueberries or chocolate chips to your liking,
during or after cooking. If you want chocolate
flavoured pancakes just add 1-2 tbsp. of chocolate
powder. Since I’m not going to show it off to Gordon
Ramsay, I’m not usually too fussy over whether the
pancakes are perfect circles, and you shouldn’t be
either. A weirdly-shaped, sweet, flour-based blob is
as good as any pancake.

M
icrowaves are truly students’ saviors –
all those Tesco ready meals it churns
out hot and steaming, not forgetting
the heavenly sound of popcorn as it’s
prepared for your stomach. Now add one more item
to the list of wonderful things the microwave can
do – cakes!
By chocolate powder I mean the regular hot
chocolate powder you might find in your cupboard,
nothing baking grade – remember: we are striving
for simplicity. You can just use any kind of wheat
flour: self-raising flour will give a fluffier cake, but
normal flour will do too, if you’re not too picky.
Remember that if you want to get a normal cake, and
not a squished one, you’ll need to add some baking
powder – normally, you add 1 tbsp. of baking powder
for every 1 cup of flour, but I’d say you should go
with ¼ or even ⅛ tbsp. in this case. Milk is any
milk – whole, semi-skimmed, quarter-skimmed,
anything will do. I’m not too sure about plant-based
milk like almond milk though. Guess you’ll have to
experiment yourself to find out!
The point of university
life is that you can have
pancakes anytime you
want – that’s basically all
the time.
W
hat is the best thing in the world?
Besides sugar, I mean (and maybe
pizza, and ice-cream, and chocolate
and...oh, you’ve gotten my point!).Yes,
you’ve guessed right – cinnamon! While you might
be thinking “but cinnamon rolls are not quick!”, let
me tell you how wrong you are. If you prepare them
in the evening, you can bake them in the morning
while you are taking a shower – it doesn’t take that
long, there’s not a lot of work involved, and what
better breakfast is there than hot cinnamon rolls?!
Being a student is not always bad, right?
me, but occasionally, after
a nine-to-five day full of
labs and lectures, you just
want to have something
warm, sweet, and – most
importantly – quick and
easy to make. I once added
so much sugar to my tea
that my housemate asked
me, in a very serious tone,
if I was making tea or di-
abetes. Oh well… Without
further ado, here are some
simple recipes that work,
even after a long harsh
day.
“It sounds
fancy, it’s
delicious,
nutritious,
filling and,
if you care
about such
things – very
Instagramable”
Finally – time to celebrate with a nice meal out!

I
f you are still reading
this – congratula-
tions! You’ve made it
through the first half
of this first term. While
it’s not a big deal, I feel
like I need a pat on the
back every time I manage
to get more than five hours
of sleep, so… surviving
for so long made me think
that I actually have to
celebrate. I mean, I only
have three deadlines and
two tests coming up, but
if I can survive so far, I’ll
manage to hang on a bit
longer. Trust me, so will
you.
And now that you’ve
realised what a great thing
you’ve accomplished, I
think you want to cel-
ebrate, right? I am not
saying that you should go
bankrupt for one celebra-
tory meal, but I think that
you should invest a little
bit in it. Treat yourself!
Go crazy! This is why
it’s called “celebrating”,
right?
So, here comes the list
eat everything on this list,
you’ll have to go to the
gym. Or change half your
clothes for a bigger size.
But do try some of them!
Best breakfast
Having breakfast out
is a bit weird for me as I
wouldn’t normally wake
up early enough to have
time to go out and not be
late for class when I can
just sleep in a bit more
and enjoy my cereal. But
sometimes, when I have a
free day and I cannot sleep,
I like exploring what this
city has to offer. The good
thing is that, for breakfast,
there are few places where
you have to wait the same
length you might wait for
lunch or dinner.
This is how I’ve discov-
ered Chiltern Firehouse (1
Chiltern St, Marylebone)
and their a-maz-ing break-
fast – biggest problems
with it are that I don’t
have time for it everyday
and I definitely don’t
have the funds. But it’s
a great experience! I’ve
only eaten there once and
I still want to recommend
it. And because it’s cele-
bratory and it’s breakfast
out, I’d say try something
that you don’t normally
go for – lobster and crab
omlette! It sounds fancy,
it’s delicious, nutritious,
filling, and – if you care
about such things – very
Instagramable.
Celebratory steak is a
must!
My best friend took
me to have some steak
after I finished my first
year – he is a huge lover
of steak – and I must admit
that, even if the meal itself
was somewhat out-of-this-
world, the experience itself
was more than I asked for.
HIX Oyster and Chop
House (36-37, Greenhill
Rents, Cowcross Street)
is not something I would
have picked for myself but
after having the Glenarm
Estate Porterhouse for
two to share (yes, I had to
Google the exact name),
I keep telling myself that
I need to go back at least
once more – especially
since I’ve heard that they
have a Sunday roast.
I seriously cannot praise
this steak enough, and
before you take my word
for it, you should know
that I constantly complain
about how tasteless most
food is in London. You
should seriously find some
time and go give them
a try – but double check
the prices before ordering
something as they tend
to be quite high (I should
thank my friend for also
paying for the dinner,
right?)
Celebratory dessert
Whenever I am talking
about food, I try not to
sound too pretentious, but
I cannot constrain myself
this time and I am going
to recommend, in my
opinion, the best cake in
London – and trust me,
I’ve eaten enough cake in
London to know the best
when I try it – it’s a Godiva
cafe. Truth be told, I’ve
only been to one Godiva
cafe (the one in Harrods
– 87-135 Brompton Rd,
Knightsbridge) and I have
no idea if there are any
other around, but this one
is perfectly placed as it is
fairly close to uni.
I’ve tried all their cakes
and I love most of them,
but, my favourite by far
is the white chocolate
baked cheesecake. I eat it
at least once a month and
I have to admit that it’s
been consistently good
– not just once in while
which can happen in some
places. The chocolate is
not overpowering and
it matches perfectly the
cheese flavour. You almost
feel like you are not eating
something sweet, and the
consistency is just great –
one slice is a bit too much
for a single person and
this is a shame. It comes
with melted chocolate that
makes it a little bit too
sweet but it’s amazing on
its own!
Treat yourself with a meal that is nicer than your usual pasta and celebrate the fast approaching of the end of the
term! We’ve got you covered for all three meals of the day because dinner must be cake!
