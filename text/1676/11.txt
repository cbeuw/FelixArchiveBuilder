and now into reality
Despite being over 30 years old, The Handmaid’sTale, with its warning of a future of curtailed women’s rights, is as
disturbingly familiar as ever.

I
t seems the morning
news is scarcely with-
out another allegation
of sexual assault these
days. Harvey Weinstein
has inspired many stars,
mostly women, to share
their stories of abuse
by people with power.
Finally, these hard-hitting
topics may finally be
discussed at a meaningful
level through their associ-
ation with a billion-dollar
industry. These issues
aren’t old news and they
aren’t insignificant, but
women’s rights have not
been resolved in over a
century.
Margaret Atwood
drew upon many feminist
themes which have
remained universally
constant throughout
history in her 1985 novel
The Handmaid’s Tale. She
imagined the downfall of
America into Gilead, an
authoritarian patriarchy
whose greatest concern
is to reproduce. Nuclear
waste has caused most
women to be sterile and
a strict class system has
been developed so that the
rich may procreate using
“handmaid” surrogates. In
Gilead, surrogacy is not a
medical procedure – it’s
even more intrusive. These
women are subjected to
ritualised rape, leading to
one of the most disturbing
book chapters I have ever
read.
Though many would
like to say feminism is no
longer an issue, it cannot
be denied that in some
ways nothing has changed,
as evidenced by The Hand-
maid’s Tale and the current
situation in Hollywood.
It’s not fantastical to think
there are still people who
could imagine exploiting
another person’s sexuality,
whether it’s their will or
not. A problem that was
big enough to base a novel
on in the 80s has resur-
faced in a big way.
“Regardless
of its political
message, the
novel still
shines due
to Atwood’s
masterful
writing style”
“The novel has
always been
powerful and
keeps growing
in power
as it gains
exposure”
While I see sexual
assault as the most striking
theme of The Handmaid’s
Tale there are many
more which can also be
paralleled with present
day. Abortion, homopho-
bia, and racism are also
covered byAtwood as well
as by modern media. Even
the political climate that
was around while Atwood
wrote is echoed by ours. It
was a time of conservative
revival with Reagan and
Thatcher taking control.
I’m sure you can picture
the equivalents that I’m
thinking off. Based upon
this book, society seems
to have stalled since its
publication. It’s been said
that a recent TV adapta-
tion of Atwood’s novel is
even more disturbing than
its source, but I think the
true horror can be found in
how it compares to reality
through time.
Regardless of its
political message, the
novel still shines due
to Atwood’s masterful
writing style. Often it’s
deceptively simple with a
satisfying mixture of short
and long, listed sentences.
Though easy to follow,
there’s a hint of mystery,
something unfamiliar.
Atwood likes to play with
tense, often changing
between paragraphs. It’s
not always noticeable, but
makes the text all the more
unsettling. The narrator,
Offred, can seem unstuck
in time. Her stories of
before start with a strong
sense of memory and
nostalgia. Then, slowly,
she reverts and seeps back
to another time, absorbed
by it. The whole novel
is part of Offred’s mind,
and Atwood doesn’t hold
back on reminding us that
she is a biased narrator.
Offred recounts the same
scenes multiple times
with different outcomes,
a trick Atwood plays with
in other works. The reader
may seek the truth, ask
what really happened to
characters, but it’s more
meaningful to delve into
what the narrator believes,
what she wishes for, to
know when she’s lost
hope.
Our exploration of the
dystopian world is through
its characters and their
emotions. Atwood doesn’t
turn her political idea
into a battle, revolution
or epic quest. It’s simply
a description of a corrupt
government and the effect
it has on its people. No
one has grand goals, they
only want to survive,
and reclaim their identity
if they can. Dystopian
novels of late have been
riddled with teen angst and
love triangles. This novel
is a call back to the true
power of the genre – an
exploration of people and
how the future needs to be
protected from emotional
disaster.
Still, Offred isn’t a beat
down, obedient character.
She may act that way, but
in secret she rebels. You
can still feel the person
she was before the regime
through her witty narra-
tion and clever references.
Atwood’s playful voice
also adds a little uplift
with the inclusion of small
but frequent jokes. Even
one of the most powerful
quotes from the book
“Nolite Te Bastardes Car-
borundorm. Don’t let the
bastards grind you down,”
was a made up phrase that
Atwood found amusing
during her school days.
This particular phrase
has been taken as a
powerfulmessagebymany
and is a popular choice for
tattoos. But the influence
of the novel extends
beyond body adornment.
Last June, Hulu released
its TV adaptation which
has since won eight Emmy
Awards and been renewed
for season 2. The striking
Handmaid uniforms from
the series with their white
bonnets and red capes
have been worn to protest
changes to Planned Par-
enthood and abortion laws
in America. Vera Wang
used the bonnets in her
2017 Spring/Summer col-
lection to comment upon
female oppression. Her
conservative but slightly
provocative designs have
been said to look like
“armour”. This seems
to be the influence The
Handmaid’s Tale has – it
informs readers of polit-
ical threats and inspires
them to rally together into
a stronger entity.
As for the future, I don’t
see Atwood’s work disap-
pearing any time soon.
The novel has always
been powerful and keeps
growing in power as it
gains exposure. Hopefully
in the next 30 years there
will be changes that finally
turn the book’s themes
into history, as there
should have been since the
its publication. Until them,
lessons and inspiration can
be found in its pages.

In the relentless tread of time, a man searches for the
greater miracle of life
Austrian writer Thomas Glavinic’s The Greater Miracle explores one man’s life when pushed to the extreme in a
brilliant piece of storytelling.

reedom – a word
as awe-inspiring
as it is undefined.
There are many
ways of tackling the issue
of what freedom means
on a general as well as
on a personal level. In his
2013 novel The Greater
Miracle Thomas Glavinic
sheds light on the problem
of freedom from a very
personal perspective.
The novel is split into
two storylines, that run
parallel to each other. The
first one unfolds in the
present day and gives an
account of the protagonist,
Jonas, trying to summit
Mount Everest. The
second one tells the story
of Jonas from the earliest
days of his childhood to
the present. He grows up
in theAustrian countryside
with his mentally disabled
brother. Because they
are subject to frequent
abuse by their alcoholic
mother, Jonas and his
brother are adopted by
Picco, the grandfather of
Jonas’ best friend. Picco
is a wealthy man, to say
the least. They live in a
mansion, are surrounded
by servants and live an
overall very luxurious life.
Because of the wealth and
power of Picco, Jonas and
his best friend Werner are
pretty much allowed to
do whatever they like. At
one point they even blow
up the pigsty of a local
farmer with no serious
repercussions.
Their life seems
perfect until Jonas’
brother is killed. Jonas
hardly recovers from the
shock and he feels even
worse when Werner dies
shortly thereafter in a car
accident. As if life could
not get worse anymore,
now Picco also dies from
cancer. Being the only one
of Picco’s sons left alive,
he inherits a fortune. As
a young man with a near
infinite amount of money
on his bank account, he
tries to live his life to the
“Glavinic is
notorious for
exploring the
behaviour
of people
in extreme
situations in
his novels”
“Glavinic’s
brilliant
storytelling
and the
exciting plot
definitely
make for a
great read”
fullest. He travels around
the world, restlessly
searching for something
he cannot quite grasp.
Although the outline
of the story resembles a
simple adventure novel
in some ways, this book
is not necessarily an easy
read. The two storylines
are written in rather differ-
ent styles. The first one is
fast paced and especially
towards the end of the
book almost hurries the
reader through the story.
The second one, on the
other hand, is written in a
more fluent way, bridging
long time spans and telling
everything calmly and in
great detail. These two
different styles sharpen
the contrast between what
happens in the present and
what happened in the past,
and now essentially is a
memory of Jonas.
Glavinic is notorious
for exploring the behav-
iour of people in extreme
situations in his novels. In
this novel it is Jonas, who
grapples with the question
of what to do with one’s
timeonthisplanet.Already
as a teenager he thinks:
“Time is neutral. Time is
indifferent to everything.
Time is relentless. Not
one second, that is not
followed by the next. Not
one second, that would not
have passed. No matter if
good or bad.” It seems
that what drives Jonas,
what makes him spend
one year in an apartment
in Rome without leaving
the house, or build a tree-
house in the dark forests
of Norway, is exactly the
search for an answer to
this question. He travels
around aimlessly, not
knowing what to look out
for, until the search itself
appears to become what
he has been looking for in
the first place. It is in some
sense a logical conclusion
following from Jonas’ life
to climb Mount Everest,
this beast of futility, which
has become both the life
goal but also the end of the
lives of so many. In fact,
when Jonas nearly dies
on the descent back down
from the summit, the only
thing that goes through
his head is “go on, keep
searching”.
It makes sense that
Jonas’ life and the whole
narrative culminate in
Jonas climbing Mount
Everest. When asked
about why he wanted to
summit Mount Everest,
English mountaineer
George Mallory famously
answered: “Because it’s
there!”. That is exactly
what Jonas comes to
realise, that maybe
“Because it’s there!” is the
best explanation we will
ever be able to give for
why we do anything.
What I liked about this
book is its lack of naivety.
Glavinic does not pretend
that money is irrelevant for
one’s happiness. Indeed,
what makes Jonas free is
his money. Those who do
not have to worry about
money have the time to
focus on finding out what
actually makes their lives
worth living. Money,
quite literally, buys you
time. While reading this
book, I was constantly
reminded of A Happy
Death by Albert Camus,
who also describes the
life of a man who acquires
a lot of money and then
finds himself in a situation
where he is essentially free
to do whatever he wants.
Still, while Camus tends
to actually explore the
moral implications of this
kind of life, The Greater
Miracle does come
across as a bit of a cliché
sometimes. However,
Glavinic’s brilliant sto-
rytelling and the exciting
plot definitely make for
a great read. What makes
his books great is that
the describes people in
very singular and extreme
situation, which inevitably
makes the reader think
about how he or she would
act under those particular
circumstances.
