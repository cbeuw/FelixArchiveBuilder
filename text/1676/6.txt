Imperial should expand the gym at Ethos –
it’s not that hard
Imperial cannot seriously claim it cares about the mental health of its students and staff while
providing them with the smallest sport facilities you can find.

L
et’s start with
an assumed
fact, and im-
agine that we
live in a perfect, ideal
world in which things
work as they should and
we don’t have to worry
about anything. Let’s
assume Imperial College
is committed to tackling
mental health issues.
Let’s say they are.
I mean, they opened
a counselling service,
didn’t they? I’ve seen
mental health campaigns
around. Some allocation
of resources is going
into it, so it must be one
of their priorities. Right?
Right?
Let’s now go through
a logical argument. It
requires three assump-
tions as its main ingre-
dients:
- Practicing sport
helps to keep your mind
healthy.
- Gyms are a standard,
convenient way of prac-
ticing sport, especially
for busy people.
- Imperial College is
committed to tackling
mental health issues.
Okay, we mix these
assumptions in our brand
new logical blender,
and we get a nice, cold,
creamy smoothie called
the Ethos Energia gym.
You look at your creation
and are pretty confident
it’s going to be amazing.
I mean, you followed the
recipe: if Imperial wants
to help with students’
mental health, sport is
one of many ways to
do so, and gyms are the
most standard way of
practising sport, it surely
follows that they should
shoes of someone who
makes the resolution to
start a gym habit. You
go the first time, see the
90% occupancy notice,
get changed, go in, and
observe the panorama.
You’ve vaguely heard
interval training is good,
so you make your way
to the treadmills to have
your first session. There
are three people waiting.
Maybe the first two
or three times you are
resilient and decide to
wait, but if you’ve had a
long day, you might just
go back home without
starting, completely dis-
there. After that, there is
still space to buy many
more of all of them. And
you’ll free up a lot of
space upstairs to expand
the weights area, buy
more machines, and in
general just have a much
better gym.
Can we just transform
the waiting area into an
extension of the gym?
Of course! Some staff
members report that
the space is not used a
lot anyway. Sometimes
large groups of kids
do have to wait there,
but I’m sure they can
wait where the vending
machines are. It’s only a
bit of waiting. You don’t
need to be treated like a
king. The space where
the vending machines
are can definitely be
turned into the waiting
area.
And okay, if you’re
one of those that is
going to miss the ping-
pong table, get a grip
on yourself. It’s just a
ping-pong table. Surely
you can make this little
sacrifice for us. Take
it for the team. I am
confident you can find
somewhere else to fill
your ping-pong urges (I
hear Imperial has a very
good table tennis club).
So yes, here I am,
asking Alice Gast to
expand the gym at Ethos.
I trust you can do it.
Show us you care about
your students and staff.
If you agree with me,
please sign the petition.
I’m sure most Imperial
students and staff agree
that there is a problem,
so let’s try to actually
make an impact, even if
you will graduate before
this ever happens. Link

“Ethos has
a very large
waiting area at
the entrance.
Why not
expand into
that area?”
couraged by the insane
number of people there.
So yes, it is absolutely
outrageous that Imperial,
with its supposed com-
mitment to mental health
issues, has such a small
gym for the amount of
students and staff there
are. And the situation
will only get worse
as student numbers
increase.
Thankfully, there are
ways to tackle this issue
head on. Ethos has a very
large waiting area at the
entrance, full of tables
and chairs. Why not
expand the gym into that
area? There is enough
space to move all the
current treadmills, ellip-
tical trainers, static bikes
and rowing machines
“Ethos’ gym
size is not
encouraging
more people to
go to the gym
regularly”
invest in having a world-
class gym facility, with
amazing personnel, state
of the art equipment,
and accessibility to any
kind of student or staff
member, regardless of
age and gym experience.
Except you attempt
to try the smoothie and
find out something is
not right. It’s not really
that the ingredients are
wrong. It’s that there are
too many people who
want to drink it. You find
yourself surrounded by
20 people asking to have
a bit, and before you
know it, you’ve ran out
of smoothie before even
trying it.
This is the problem
with the gym at Ethos
at the moment: it’s too
small for the amount
of people who’d want
to use it. Anyone who
has tried to go on a
Monday at 5pm knows
this for sure. You’ll find
queues for treadmills
and rowing machines.
Groups of three or even
four sharing a bench.
Weightlifters squeezing
into the minimal space
needed to do a side
lateral raise without
hitting everyone with a
12kg weight.
Don’t get me wrong,
I am not saying sharing
a bench at the gym is
bad (it’s actually often
preferable). I just don’t
think Ethos’s size is en-
couraging more people
to go to the gym regular-
ly. Put yourself into the
