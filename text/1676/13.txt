The Felix guide to the London jazz scene: the clubs
L
ondon boasts jazz
venues renowned
around the world
and cozy holes-
in-the-wall where you
can catch a legendary
performer ten years before
they become famous:
Troy Bar
Hoxton
Out of all the places on
this list, Troy Bar has to be
my favourite, just in terms
of how full of life it is
and the intensity of music
the performers provide
across genres. The place is
known for its open mic on
Tuesdays, with the likes
of Erykah Badu and Macy
Gray having stepped up
on that stage. The house
band and host are the real
attraction; the band will
riff with any performer
that comes to the stage
– despite not knowing
what they’re planning to
perform – and with the
host, they flow in and out
of interludes tightly. The
rest of the week is filled
with amazing nights:
fusion jams happen on
Wednesday and Friday,
and a reggae night is
held on Thursday. The
place is open ‘til 1am
most nights and is worth
checking out, even if it’s
just to try some pretty
decent Caribbean food.
Ronnie Scott’s
Soho
The most renowned
jazz club in London,
Ronnie Scott’s, delivers
the highest quality live
music in the whole of the
city. It must be the reputa-
tion of the place, because
world famous jazz artists
down to anxious students
always play at their finest,
hoping to prove them-
selves in front of their
musical peers. The jam
upstairs on Wednesdays
is definitely the best night
for 50s/60s jazz vibes:
hosted by a trumpeter who
plays all your favourite
licks one after the other,
the music goes on ‘til 3am.
The jam opens up after the
first set, and musicians
who want to perform sit
behind the band, waiting
to be called up. In terms of
the music they play, it can
be a bit showoff-y, with
performers playing their
fastest lines in the highest
register possible. But it’s
still very impressive to
watch, and if you’re lucky,
your favourite musician
travelling through London
might even show up
and play a couple tunes.
Vortex Jazz Club
Dalston
The Vortex holds many
great performances from
a variety of international
acts; they hold a pretty
decent jam session on
Sundays also. Lead by a
guitarist, which gives a
different dynamic to the
usual piano combo, the
house band perform to a
high standard, similar to
Ronnie’s, yet without the
same pressured atmos-
phere (or cleanness). It’s
quite a relaxed environ-
ment, with seats and a
small bar with an accom-
panying view of Gillett
Square (one of the weirdest
places in Hackney). It’s
more of an alternative to
Ronnie Scotts (essentially
a free version of the
club) but still provides
excellent music from very
competent musicians.
Mau Mau Bar
Notting Hill
Home to the Jazz
Re:freshed residency,
Mau Mau Bar hosts all
the best up-and-coming
London musicians on their
Thursday shows. This
place gives you the op-
portunity to hear the next
stars in the London jazz
scene before they blow up.
Groups such as Binker and
Moses, Yussef Kamaal,
and the Ashley Henry Trio
have come through Mau
Mau Bar into popularity.
The intimate setting of
the stage is slightly raised
above the audience who
crowd round, giving a
unique experience to the
listeners; probably the last
time that you’ll be able
to stand so close to them.
Metric Jazz Jams
South Kensington
Okay, maybe not on the
same level as the other
places, but the jazz jams
at Metric every other
Tuesday are a great place
for Imperial students to
listen to decent live music
at their favourite local
venue. Plus, it’s probably
the only time you’re
gonna see Metric filled
with not (completely)
pissed people. Being a stu-
dent-lead jam, it’s a very
accessible way of playing
jazz with people of similar
skill levels and the organ-
isers are very welcoming
to whoever wants to come
up and play a tune. Even if
jazz isn’t your thing, they
do cheap cocktails too!
The Cap’n Jazz reunion doesn’t disappoint
F
ollowing on from
the success of the
recent American
Football reun-
ion, 2017 was graced
by another re-kindling
of nostalgic spirit from
the Kinsella clan in the
legendary form of Cap’n
Jazz. 28 years from their
formation and 22 years
after the release of the
succinctly titled Burritos,
Inspiration Point, Fork
Balloon Sports, Cards
in the Spokes, Automatic
Biographies, Kites, Kung
Fu, Trophies, Banana
Peels We’ve Slipped
On and Egg Shells
We’ve Tippy Toed Over
(affectionately known
as Shmap’n Shmazz,
obviously), Tim Kinsella
spewed his guts out as
if not a single day had
passed since they were 18.
The gravity and impor-
tance of Cap’n Jazz cannot
be overstated as they are,
arguably, the original emo
band that pioneered the
twinkly, energetic, wistful
sound that oh so many
bands have since tried,
but not quite managed, to
emulate.
“We’re only going to
play songs from our new
album tonight” Victor
Villarreal proclaimed
at Camden’s Electric
Ballroom on November
8th, “make sure you catch
it in 1995” before bursting
into the chaotic ‘Oh
Messy Life’ with lyrics as
coherent as its famously
shroom-addled writing
session. Few frontmen
command as much energy
and adoration from their
fans as an inebriated Tim
Kinsella who, in between
French horn solos, spent
more time on top of the
crowd than the stage, re-
peatedly hurling his tam-
bourine before realising he
needed it for the next song.
It was plain to see how
much this moment meant
to those in attendance; not
a single lyric was missed,
with many older fans
screaming their lungs out
in a desperate attempt to
relive and recapture some
lost youth.
This was a funeral as
much as a reunion, with
Kinsella announcing “we
played our first show in
October 1989 and, barring
a miracle of money, this
is going to be our last”,
clearly evident in his
expression how dear and
special everything about
the band was to him. The
jubilant, beaming smile
on Nate Kinsella’s face
throughout the gig was
almost tear-inducing, es-
pecially when paired with
songs of lost childhood
and the inevitability of
growing up. As the main
show was brought to a
close with ‘Ooh do I love
you’, the magical atmos-
phere in the room was
overwhelming. We were
then treated to an encore
with their iconic cover of
‘Take on me’ (you need to
check this one out, trust
me). Few bands have had
the impact and emotional
influence of Cap’n Jazz,
and their final night
couldn’t have been a more
fitting farewell.

The new Taylor Swift album can’t come to the phone
right now. Why? Oh, ‘cause it’s shit.
Bigger and bolder than her previous works, Taylor Swift’s sixth LP is far removed from her country roots. It’s a
powerful statement that unequivocally cements her as one of this century’s most mediocre sensations.
I
t’s not too long since
the world was intro-
duced to girl next
door and singer-song-
writer, Taylor Swift, with
her guitar and her country
tinged pop. Upon entering
the scene, Swift instantly
made massive waves in
the music industry and
pop culture, for better or
worse, with singles like
‘You belong with me’
and ‘Teardrops on My
Guitar’. The young and
oh-so-naive Swift would,
in the early 2010’s, evolve
into your standard cookie
cutter international pop
star with the clean, pol-
ished image and corporate
pieces that labels like PC
Music could unironically
ship. Singles like ‘We Are
Never Ever Getting Back
Together’, ‘Shake it Off’
and ‘I Knew You Were
Trouble’ were marketing
masterpieces, with just the
right lyrics and amount
of saccharine plastic
production to secure mass
popularity. Then there
were the rough years. With
negative media attention
and the notorious back and
forth with a certain Mr. K.
West, the pristine image of
Swift had been gradually
tainted in the public eye.
The biggest catalyst
for Swift Inc.’s latest
re-branding effort Repu-
tation would have to be
the aforementioned bout
with Kanye over the (now,
infamous) ‘Famous’ verse
on West’s latest project,
The Life of Pablo. For the
unaware, West, in the first
30 seconds, proclaims that
he “and Taylor might still
have sex” as he “made
that bitch famous”. This
resulted in a lot of publi-
cised tension between the
two parties, the apex being
Kim Kardashian releasing
a video depicting Swift’s
consent to the audacious
verse.
“Sonically, this
has to be one
of the worst
produced pop
albums in a
long time”
That brings us to today.
Swift is now a hip, mature,
and self-aware pop star.
Or at least, she tries to
be. As a declaration of
her edginess, she released
an hour-long album that
immediately fell flat on
its face. Her previous
material was passable; I
wouldn’t actively choose
to listen to it, sure, but I
could stomach it without
a knee-jerk reaction as
intense and visceral as I
have now. Sonically, this
has to be one of the worst
produced pop albums in a
long time. The sounds that
producers Max Martin
and Shellback bring on
Reputation are absolutely
grating, with some of the
worst mixing I have ever
had the misfortune to hear,
especially prominent on
the first track ‘...Ready
For It?’.
The opener presents
some sort of cheap imita-
tion of West’s Yeezus, with
a large, buzzy baseline and
blaring horns. The vaguely
industrial production of
the start is immediately
juxtaposed with Swift’s
sickly sweet harmonies,
and then synth pads which
eventually all end up in a
nauseating mix. The mish-
mash of bass, horns, dis-
torted snares, and Swift’s
vocals at the end resem-
bles something of a sonic
train wreck, and is frankly
unlistenable thanks to the
horrible mixing.
Other deeper cuts like
‘Look What You Made
Me Do’ and ‘Gorgeous’
have some laughable
production choices. As
the album progresses,
the Yeezy fetish dies off
and Swift quickly settles
into her old routine, with
some basic synthpop and
a smattering of whatever
is currently in (in this case
tropical house and a trap
song featuring Future).
They are not in any way
remarkable. In fact, they
are the very opposite, dull
and dross. Swift does an
impeccable FKA Twigs
impersonation in ‘Dress’,
uncomfortably similar
in structure and melody
of Twigs’ ‘Pendulum’.
Somewhat surprisingly,
the final track has a
funny jittery piano piece,
expressing some real,
genuine emotion for the
first, and perhaps only,
time on the entire album.
Ironically, this was the last
track and this atmosphere
dies off after the first
minute, when an awkward
guitar strolls into the mix.
Lyrically, the album is
filled with cringeworthy
snippets of half-baked
attempts to be shocking.
The main culprit here is
Swift’s hyper literalism,
which left me wincing. I
guess only a work of great
art from an artist who had
mastered their craft could
evoke such a physical
reaction. Swift forgoes
any semblance of subtlety,
spouting pure shite in an
almost vulgar, brutish
way. There are a couple of
songs in particular which
display Swift’s literary
prowess. On ‘I Did Some-
thing Bad’, she’s a witch
being burned at the stake
(“they’re burning all the
witches even if you aren’t
one, so light me up (x8)”).
On lead single ‘Look What
You Made Me Do’ she
explains the reinvention
of her image and identity
by suggesting that the “old
Taylor can’t come to the
phone right now. Why?
Oh, ‘cause she’s dead!”.
Swift also describes her
past year as “so Gatsby”.
When Swift isn’t being a
lyrical bull in a chinashop,
she sings about her rela-
tionship and love life, not
saying anything new or
worth noting.
The biggest achieve-
ment of it all was my
unending patience to sit
through this, and to come
into it with an open mind.
Reputation doesn’t do
much well: not the vibe,
not the arrangements, and
certainly not the lyrics. In
fact, it is not unreasonable
to say it does nothing well.
Flat generic vocals mixed
in with drab over-produced
and poorly mixed music
all makes for a product
to attract attention, not an
album with any intrinsic
artistic merit. This is the
right product for Swift’s
market segment, those
preteens from when Swift
first broke through, now
angry hormonal teenagers
who can relate to this
vapid mess.
