SleepImperial leads to “inappropriate napping”
HANGMAN

held its SleepImperial
week last week,

of inappropriate
napping across

T
he campaign,
which aimed to
promote healthy
sleeping pat-
terns and awareness of
the impact of tiredness,
was carried out during
the past week across
Imperial. However,
Felix has heard reports
that students and staff,
encouraged by the
campaign, have taken
to sleeping at unusual
times, causing massive
disturbance.
wouldn’t mind that much
when students nap in
here,” one librarian told
Felix, “but with a large
section of the library
being out of commission,
and huge increase in the
number of nappers, this
is really taking the piss.”
Traditionally, the library
had a dedicated sleeping
area – with cushions and
duvets – in the fiction
section, which nobody
ever went to, and few
knew existed. However, a
number of students have
dragged mattresses into
the stacks and set up camp.
One student Felix
spoke to expressed their
annoyance: “It’s annoying
enough to have people
leave their shit on the
table when they go to the
library cafe for lunch, but
now people are going off
to ‘power nap’ for four
hours, and I just can’t
deal.”
McCrystler, a second-year
mechanical engineering
student, had begun taking
micro-naps in the Tanpopo
queue. “I mean, this is
such a ridiculously long
wait,” she told Felix from
her camp bed, “I might as
well catch up on a bit of
sleep while I wait for my
katsu curry.”
A Union representative
told Felix that they were
“very pleased” at how
well SleepImperial had
been received. “We are so
proud that the hard work
of our campaigns team
has paid off.” they told
Felix, “Here in the Union
Offices, we have also
taken on the lessons from
SleepImperial, and banned
caffeine in the offices.”

Jon Smithson, Vice
Provost (Micronapping
and Sleep Hygiene),
said that the College had
also made a number of
changes: “We’ve long
been committed to the
welfare of our staff: earlier
this year we converted
our media suite into a
dedicated sleep-pod, and
an on-site sleep coach is
available to any staff who
want to get better rest.
This week, we’ve taken
things further, and given
all Sport Imperial staff the
week off to sleep.” Felix
has heard reports that a
number of ACC teams
are very happy with this
arrangement.

of students
have dragged
mattresses into
the stacks and
set up camp”
Central Library have
reported a record number
of complaints of people
falling asleep in the
library. “Normally I

This week you’re
outraged to read about
Imperial’s poor standing
in the green league tables
in Felix. You then throw
your copy straight in the
bin. It’s called recycling
you twat.
This week you go
to your quiet place, the
Sherfield sub-basement, to
have a mental breakdown,
but it’s the middle of
winter term, so there’s a
pretty long queue.
This week you’re a
student at Imperial, home
of world-leading research,
and you can’t wait to
get started on your MSc
Petroleum Geoscience
project! (Horoscope
brought to you by Shell)
This week it’s the start
of cuffing season, so you
decide to settle down
with the only thing that’s
ever really loved you
unreservedly: your right
hand.
This week you’re
hugely upset that Greggs
chose to replace Jesus
with a sausage roll in their
Xmas adverts. It should
clearly be a portion of
curly fries.
This week you’re
Morrissey. Just stop.
Please.
This week you’re
planning on putting down
a deposit on your house,
but then you pass by
the JCR, and before you
know if you’ve spent
£10,000 on sandwiches.
This week you take
inspiration from James
Dyson, decide “no grade
is better than a bad
grade”, and refuse to hand
in your coursework. You
get a bad grade.
This week you’re the
Teaching Excellence
Framework, and nobody
really knows what you are
or why you exist.
This week you try
and use the fact that
the Christmas adverts
are appearing on TV
to distract yourself
from the fundamental
meaninglessness of life. It
works. Kinda.
This week you work in
the Grantham Institute,
and press people keep
asking you for comments
on Imperial’s position
in the green league
tables. You’ve run out of
synonyms for “surprised”
and “disappointed”.
This week you’re the
Felix Puzzles Editor,
and you’re bitterly
disappointed not to have
the back cover. You
quietly vow to wage war
with the Sports section.

ImperialCollegeUnion
announced yesterday
that the Spanner
Bearer of the City and
Guilds College Union
(CGCU) was to be paid
in actual legitimate
cashmonies.
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
T
he Spanner
Bearer is the
member of the
CGCU commit-
tee responsible for en-
suring the safety of the
spanner, lifting it during
CGCU BOOMALAKA,
and a number of other
completely bizarre tradi-
tions that nobody really
understands.
Paul Balaji, the current
Spanner Bearer, said that
the role “has an extremely
heavy workload, mostly
involving guard duty”, but
that this takes its toll on
their studies. Furthermore,
Balaji reports frequently
having to make emergen-
cy runs to the Union for
curly fries during night
shifts, draining his student
loan. “I’ve had to lift that
fucking spanner so many
times, I no longer have
the strength in my arms
to do any coursework. As
a result, I’ve got to stay
here an extra year, or until
the feeling returns to my
hands.” The CGCU say
that remuneration would
help the Spanner Bearer’s
financial health as an indi-
vidual.
A spokesperson for
Imperial College Union
said that they weren’t
aware of this plan and that
they didn’t have £10,000
to give to the spanner
bearer, as the Reception
desk was starting to look
a little shabby, and the
money would need to
be ring-fenced. A Union
spokesperson said “we
are committed to student
welfare, and will hold a
staff development day to
brain-storm, mind-map,
and think-juice potential
sources of revenue.”
Rumours that this will
include writing ideas down
on small pieces of paper
and emptying them into an
inflatable globe like that
one from Crystal Maze are
entirely well-founded.
The College told Felix
that they thought that this
was a lot of nonsense, but
said that “the collabora-
tive nature of bearing the
Spanner, working with
the bearer of the Bolt,
is a very cohesive and
affirmative experience for
the students involved”. A
spokesperson also clarified
that the College would not
be providing any of the
funds, as they had “much
more important things to
be buying”. When asked
for further details, the
spokesperson refused
to comment (although
one staff member in the
Faculty Building was
overheard yelling “yasss
new yoga mats”).
It is yet to be es-
tablished whether the
freshly-paid-up Spanner
Bearer would be punished
for consistently allowing
the spanner to be stolen
by the RCSU. Suggest-
ed punishments from
members of the CGCU
have included “don’t pay
them, for fuck’s sake”,
“what the hell, they’re
paying people now?” and
“what’s a CGCU?”
