IC FASHION AND
DESIGN SOCIETY
Imperial College
Fashion and Design
society (ICFAD) started its
second year with a vintage
shop crawl. Twenty eager
shoppers spent the after-
noon winding their way
through the streets of Soho
browsing through floppy
hats, military jackets, and
various items covered in
embroidery and sequins.
We ended the crawl with
heaps of Hipchips – in
other words, colourful
crisps served with a sur-
prisingly extensive range
of dips, to satisfy our
rumbling stomachs.
Our first collaboration
with LeoSoc, the Hallow-
een Make-Off, was a great
chance for our members
to be spookily creative.
Some fantastic costumes
ICU RAG
Every year for 36
hours, Imperial teams
are unleashed from Beit
Quadrangle, with only
their bright Jailbreak
t-shirts, RAG goodie bags,
and creative costumes to
get as far as possible from
Imperial without spending
any of their own money!
Hitchhike, busk, haggle
All adventures start from the Imperial minivan // ICSEDS
such as space quiz and film
nights, as well as industry
talks. So far this year we
have seen the return of
our Annual Kerbal Space
Program Challenge on
7th November! Over
the coming year, we’re
planning trips to space
facilities, such as the
European Astronaut
Centre in Cologne.
So if you love space and
want to learn more about
it, gain technical skills and
connect with the best in
the industry, buy member-
ship for ICSEDS, join our
mailing list, and like us on
Facebook!
