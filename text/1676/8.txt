Farming in Chernobyl
A
leading expert
onthelong-term
environmental
consequences
of nuclear disasters is to
lead a study to help know
when and if it is safe to
go back into Chernobyl’s
human exclusion zone.
The results will support
Ukrainian authorities in
developing a timeline for
when and where it will
eventually be safe to start
using portions of no-go
land for growing crops.
The explosion at Cher-
nobyl’s nuclear power
station in 1986 was one
of the largest nuclear
accidents the world has
ever seen and resulted in
substantial amounts of ra-
dioactivity being released
into the atmosphere.
Human exclusion of
the most contaminated
parts of the exclusion zone
could remain in force for
hundreds of years, but
parts of the evacuated area
now have quite low con-
tamination levels. Some
older people currently live
in the zone unofficially,
having refused to leave
their homes. However, the
land cannot be officially
re-used without a full
assessment of the risks.
Jim Smith, Professor
of Environmental Science
at the University of Ports-
mouth, will lead a team of
UK and Ukrainian scien-
tists developing the first
environmental manage-
ment information system
devised for an exclusion
zone following a nuclear
accident.
Professor Smith will
work with the Ukrainian
government and other
partners in developing the
system. He is an expert in
modelling pollution by ra-
dionuclides, and is helping
the country to develop
a plan for the future. It
is hoped that the system
will ensure that decisions
on whether and when to
allow farming and other
activities to resume in the
zone are underpinned by
scientific advice.
The human exclusion
zone around Chernobyl
was put in place due to
chronic radiation fallout
following the accident.
Radiation was detected
across Europe – including
the UK – and as far afield
as Canada. About 135,000
residents were evacuated
from the region which
then became a no-go
zone. The exclusion zone
also brought the loss to
the country of hundreds
of thousands of acres of
forestry and agricultural
land.
In 2015 Professor
Smith published the first
long-term study of the
human exclusion zone’s
environmental health,
which found wildlife in
the Chernobyl exclusion
zone was thriving 30 years
after the accident. This is
thought to be because of
the absence of humans.
