A
fter returning
to Imperial
C o l l e g e
Union for a
society-related event
at the beginning of this
year, Helen – a recent
graduate – was sexually
assaulted by David, a
member of that socie-
ty’s committee. After
she reported the attack,
the College and Union
took seven months to
conclude her allegations
were true, in which
time the perpetrator had
become president of the
society.
Sexual abuse is wide-
spread on university
campuses: some reports
suggest that a quarter of
female students in the
UK have been sexually
assaulted, with many more
experiencing harassment.
Given the scale of the
problem, it is reasonable
to assume that the College
and the Union are able
to respond to reports of
sexual abuse in ways
that are fair, supportive,
and put student welfare
first. Helen’s experience,
however, was defined
by miscommunication,
lack of a reliable point of
contact, and the absence
of support for the victim,
society, or investigator.
I first met Helen towards
the end of September,
exactly six months since
she had first reported the
incident. We spent about
40 minutes in a cafe near
where she is now working,
and discussed the case.
Her responses to my
questions were measured
and considered, but it was
clear that she felt – and
continues to feel – angry
and disillusioned with her
experience.
§
Helen did not raise a
complaint immediately,
remaining conflicted
about the decision for
around two months: “I
was terrified that personal
attacks would be used to
dismiss my allegation:
I’d had some wine, I was
wearing a low cut dress,
I like to flirt with people
anyway. This prevented
me from coming forwards,
despite knowing what had
happened was non-con-
sensual,” she said.
What prompted her to
report it, however, was
discovering that David
was running to be presi-
dent of the society associ-
ated with the event. Such a
role, she felt, would place
him in an “inappropriate
and potentially danger-
ous” position of power.
This was something she
had experienced herself;
during her freshers’ year
at another university, her
respect for a student presi-
dent’s authority meant she
was taken advantage of
sexually, and she feared
this could happen again.
Hours before the
society’s AGM, she told
the outgoing president
what had happened; they
responded with sincerity
and recommended that she
report it to the Union.After
informing two Union staff
members, she was referred
to the College, who, during
their initial investigation,
passed her between three
different individuals.
While this was because the
College wanted to follow
the recommended guide-
lines, providing her with a
female staff member when
she gave her statement, at
no point was she assigned
an official point of contact.
After giving her statement,
she went nearly a month
with no contact, despite
