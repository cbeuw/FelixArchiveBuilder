ICXCAC Trail Team summit Mount Snowdon
Cross Country & Athletics’ subsidiary takes a trip to Wales.

ICXCAC Secretary
W
ith first
term now in
full-swing,
and some
of ICXCAC’s athletes
getting bored of endless
laps of Hyde Park,
trail captain Henry had
organised a timely trail
running tour to the noto-
rious Imperial-owned St.
Mary’s Mountain Hut in
the deepest, darkest corner
of Snowdonia National
Park.
Having failed to set off
before Friday’s rush hour,
the eager squad departed
around sunset (sadly now
about 16:30) on Friday,
November 3rd,
and settled
down for the long trip to
Wales. Within minutes,
well-known underage
fresherAymeric was on the
floor. He wasn’t laughing
(ROFL) but rather in a
bizarre contorted sleeping
position. The first weeks
of term must have really
taken their toll.
After half an hour the
minibus had made it all
the way to Hammersmith
where they successfully
organised a pick-up of a
job-hunting alumnus. The
remainder of the journey
was largely uneventful,
except for a notable
pit-stop at a sizeable
supermarket with ID-ob-
sessed till operators. As
the drowsy runners neared
their destination, the dark
Welsh roads became
narrower and bumpier.
This did not deter wannabe
rally-driver/medic Henry,
however, who breezed
through the country lanes
“As the drowsy
runners
neared their
destination,
the dark Welsh
roads became
narrower and
bumpier”
“On Sunday
some hard-
core early
risers opted
for a run up
the much
steeper side
of Snowdon
in‘Everest
conditions’”
midnight, the revellers
disembarked in a nauseous
daze and quickly entered
their accommodation for
the weekend – it had begun
to rain. To describe the hut
as bare-bones would be
generous, but the runners
were simply happy to have
arrived before the minibus
plunged into a Welsh
ditch.
The next day the squad
awoke early, with their
sights set on ascending the
highest peak in England &
Wales: the majestic Mount
Snowdon. After a short
drive to a car park near the
visitor centre for “Electric
Mountain” (which is in
fact dedicated to energy
generation rather than
some sort of rock band),
the adventurers began
their climb from a modest
altitude of just 110m
Starting out as a group,
they soon spread out as
the incline became rather
severe. On the ascent
the group passed many
incredulous walkers, and
also witnessed a pair uni-
cycling down the track!
The runners made good
progress – zooming past
the tempting café without
rest – and the leaders
reached the summit of
1085m in just over an
hour, after running the
7.5km without a break.
At such dizzying
heights, the front-runners
soon grew cold as they
waited for the rest of the
squad. They found shelter
from the relentless bitter
wind behind the wall of the
large cafeteria and station
for the famous Snowdon
train. Unfortunately –
being off-season – both
of these luxuries were
closed, leaving the group
to face the harsh reality of
a long stumble back down.
Once everyone
had arrived, the team
huddled in a circle and
began chanting to warm
themselves up. The most
popular songs referenced
the arm span of lanky
fresher Matt (He’s Got
The Whole Club In His
Span), and claimed they
were in fact from King’s
College (Everywhere
We Go). After posing
for several pics with the
stunning views of thick
fog and being mistaken
for Coventry University
Hockey Club the runners
began the daunting
descent.
On the way down
there were more stops for
photos at the route attrac-
tions such as “Lion King’s
Pride Rock” and “The End
of the World”, and this
time they did stop in the
cafe, enjoying warming
hot beverages despite the
shocking lack of contact-
less payment (and card)
acceptance.
Once back at base
camp the team annoyed a
local cafe by consuming
mostly home-made sand-
wiches on their premises
before heading back for
some well-earned rest.
That evening, the squad
re-boarded the minibus
and took a short trip to civ-
ilisation in Caernarfon for
a decent firework display,
before returning to the hut
for a night filled with the
game Articulate and some
hijinks (featuring six in a
bed).
On Sunday the group
split into two, with some
hard-core early risers
opting to try a run up
a much steeper side of
the mighty Snowdon in
“Everest conditions” of
heavy hail and strong
winds. The other half
lazed in bed before taking
a far easier run along the
nonetheless undulating
roads, then rustling up a
cracking breakfast despite
the somewhat limited
kitchen equipment.
Before long the team
were all showered and it
was time to pack up and
return to the suffocatingly
polluted metropolis of
London. That night, all
the runners took their time
to appreciate the joys of
WiFi and mobile signal,
but vowed to return to
some rural, picturesque
trails soon.
