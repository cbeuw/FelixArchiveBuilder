I
f you’re only going
to read the winner of
one fiction prize each
year, the Women’s
Prize for Fiction will
always be your best bet.
Each year the prize hon-
ours one female author
whose novel has made
the greatest impact on the
literary world in the past
year.Theprizebeganwhen
in 1991 it was noticed that
despite 60% of the novels
published at the time
being written by women,
the Booker prize shortlist
didn’t contain any female
authors that year. Previous
winners include Ali
Smith’s How to Be Both
and Eimear McBride’s
A Girl is a Half-Formed
Thing. If you’re looking
for a book which marries
discussion of complex
issues like gender, race,
sexuality, and death, with
engaging narrative, then
the Women’s Prize is the
right place to look.
This year’s winner:
The Power by Naomi
Alderman
hurt is a kind of wealth.”
This is the sentence
that sums up the spirit of
Naomi Alderman’s novel
The Power the best for
me. It is a novel which, at
its centre, is about the re-
lationship between gender
and power. When I first
read the novel this year it
changed the way I thought
about the world in a way
no book has for years.
It tells the story of four
protagonists in a world
where massive social
and political upheaval
is taking place. Women
have suddenly developed
the power of electrocu-
tion, shifting the balance
between the genders.
Women take political
office, start new religions,
and become the leaders of
gangs and mafias. Beyond
that, men and women must
begin to adjust to the new
relationship dynamics
between them, changing
the way they relate to one
another forever.
What I love about this
novel is that Alderman
refuses to take the easy
way out in her narrative.
The world doesn’t become
an instantly more peaceful
or gentle place because
women are in charge; the
power dynamics between
men and women remain
nuanced, and those with
power still abuse it. The
Power also deals with
what it’s like not to fit into
the gender constraints of
society and the pain that
can cause, but also shows
characters finding comfort
and camaraderie in being
different.
I think that the genius in
this book is that it shocks
us, without anything novel
actually happening. There
has always been a gender
based power imbalance,
and the imbalance has
always affected the way
men and women treat each
other. However, the way
Alderman reverses this
power dynamic forces
the readers to see the
misogyny in our society
with brand new eyes. All
the struggles men face in
the book are also faced by
women in parts of our real
world: from sexual abuse
and harassment, to being
unable to leave the house
without a guardian. Here
Alderman is asking why
this no longer shocks us.
This novel really asks
difficult questions of its
reader: Is it possible for
a society to truly be equal
when there is a differ-
ence in physical power
between the genders? Are
women naturally the more
peaceful gender as they
have often been assumed
to be? Is it possible to have
power without abusing it?
Alderman answers these
questions with sophistica-
tion and nuance that the
reader will find refreshing.
This isn’t a book where
the concept out shines
the writing, in fact quite
the opposite: Alderman
delivers on everything
she promises. The Power
is likely to take the place
it deserves as a modern
classic, and one of the
most important books
about gender of our gen-
eration.

The Women’s Prize
2017 runners up: my
favourite pick
AWomen’s Prize runner
up for 2017 and another
one of my favourite books
of the year is Stay With
Me by Ayobami Adebayo.
Set in Nigeria in the 1980s
and 90s, Stay With Me is
about a childless woman’s
search for meaning in a
culture where motherhood
is everything. It also
examines how infertility
affects the main charac-
ter’s relationship with her
husband and his family,
who eventually persuade
her husband to find a
second wife.
For me, Stay With
Me has the charm and
character of novels like
Chimamanda Ngozie Adi-
chie’s Half of a Yellow Sun
(another Women’s prize
winner), but also provides
the thrill of a crime drama,
with many twist and turns
throughout. Like Ngozie
Adichie, Adebayo is able
to skilfully transport the
reader to the vibrant world
of the main character,
contrasting the bright and
bustling city in which she
lives with the loneliness
and desperation infertility
can cause. This is a novel
which I think will help
many people understand
the pain of infertility, as
well as make women who
cannot have children feel
understood and heard in a
world where their stories
are often ignored.

she never would. What

she wanted. The power to
