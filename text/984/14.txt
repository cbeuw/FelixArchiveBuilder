Remarks:
An exceedingly strange aftertaste. Sultana heavy
(that's bad) with crumbly pastry.

hmmm very good"—Rekha

Remarks:
Attractive latticed top. Not half as delicious and
exceedingly good as promised. Not even
improved with cream.

no substance"—O.B.

Remarks:
Attractive top pattern. Not brandy butter, more
like brandy semolina! Pastry o.k. but a H U G E
air cavity (bloody cheek!).
Quotes:

mark?"—Simon

Cost: £0.99
Value for Money: 61%
Remarks:
A real sound mince pie—but it could be
improved with sugar on the top. Couldn't get it
out of the wrapping. It was meant to have sherry
in it, and after not being able to taste it we feel
hard done by.
Quotes:
" A better mincemeat to pastry ratio than
Kipling"—Simon

A true Skoda of the mince pie world. Dribbly
mince—awful. Pastry too crumbly.

Too many sultanas in the mince but it held
together well. Cardboard pastry though. Bit
boring really.

Too boring to inspire any comments.

Remarks:
Another large air cavity. Misleading as it looks
really bloated and offers many fake promises
(definitely good if you're having a party as they
'look' huge). The pastry is gorgeous and they
are pleasantly alcoholic with an interesting
mincemeat.
Quotes:
"If you squirt the squirty cream directly into the
cavity it makes good use of the cavity and works
fine"—Lynn

Remarks:
"Hurray, a decent pie at last". Worth the wait.
Very puffy and more like a cross with an Eccles
cake, but gorgeous none the less. Mincemeat
was nicely 'tart' and not too 'suet'. Not enough
mincemeat, but redeemed by the pastry.
Quotes:
"A welcome change of pace-stry"—Jon
"So good I had to try another to see what it was
like with cream on"—Marcus

Remarks:
These were so-called as Lynn misread the 6 on
the side of the box for a 'b' and asked us all
what 'Bic-Ed' pies were (poor dear—ed.). They
'look' excellent but even a nibble is too much.
They're rank, disgusting, putrid, horrid...The
icing is quite distasteful, much similar to a soapy
cough syrup.

Remarks:
For 'Standard' read 'Shallow'. Basically it IS a
biscuit in a metal frisbie. Is it really worth it?
'Nuff said.

raisin"—Lynn

% (=7th)
Cost: £0.67
Value for Money: Difficult to compare as not
only did it not come in a pack of six, but you're
being ripped off because you're in McDonalds
anyway.
Remarks:
Not hot! Why not! There's even the bit on the
end cautioning you of hot filling. It tastes like
mince pie, but with a funny tasting white stuff in
it. It could've been cream once...maybe. It has
the complementary McPie shell.
Quotes:
"Let's face it, you don't expect anything mince
pie-ish from McDonalds anyway"—Simon
