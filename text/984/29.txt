How is that going to affect
concentrated periods of study? And if
exams are imminent, you'll have more
than enough pressure and stress to
contend with. You certainly shouldn't
have to worry about your health as
well.
With the Student Healthcare Plan, you
won't have to face the risk of a long
wait for hospital treatment. And you
can expect to receive prompt access to
medical care in the most comfortable
surroundings.
However, as a student on a strictly
limited budget, you might also have
expected medical insurance to be
beyond your means.
Now the Student Healthcare Plan from
PPP brings you all the essential
benefits of private medical cover - at a
remarkably low cost of just £50 for
your first year's membership.
Check out the benefits in this leaflet
and judge the value for yourself.
At PPP, we've been providing private
medical insurance for more than 50
years and we'd be delighted to
welcome you to the impressive
benefits and protection of our
Student Healthcare Plan.
