'Pita!
Surgery in a private hospital is very expensive. Just look at
the costs of these frequently performed operations. It shows
how difficult it would be if you had to choose between a long
wait for NHS treatment or paying for an operation in a
private hospital.
With the Student Healthcare Plan, you won't be faced with
such problems. If NHS treatment can't be provided within 6
weeks, then you "go private". It's as simple as that.
Now you know how little it will cost to enjoy the benefits of PPP
private medical insurance - so why not apply for the Student
Healthcare Plan without delay!
It's very simple to apply. The plan is available to full-time students
up to 29 years of age. No medical examination is needed.
As soon as we have processed your enrolment,
which usually takes just a few days, you will be
* ^ immediately covered for any new medical condition
7 that arises. You may also be covered for pre-existing
J
H
^ medical conditions and you will be given the opportunity
to declare these when you receive your Membership Pack.
Your subscription can be paid monthly, quarterly or
annually - it's entirely up to you. And payment can be made
by cheque (quarterly or annually only), credit card or direct
debit. Naturally, we will be happy to accept payment from
another person on your behalf.
If you are married, your partner can also be covered, in addition
to yourself. He or she does not have to be a full-time student.
Children can also be covered. For details of family membership,
please call us FREE on 0800 33 55 55.
As a Student Healthcare Plan member, you'll receive a full
Membership Pack explaining everything fully and telling you how
to get in touch with us whenever you might need to, whether to
make a claim or for a general enquiry.
PLEASE COMPLETE THE APPLICATION FORM,
FOLD IT AS DIRECTED, THEN POST IT TO PPP
-NO STAMP REQUIRED.
