Lea De Laria
Within five minutes of starting, Lea de Laria
had half the audience shouting "I am a lesbian"
at the tops of their voices—and that's just the
men! A big dyke from the States she is loud,
raucous and hilariously funny. Be you male or
female, gay or straight, this woman is
guaranteed to have you laughing.
This time she's back with her all singing, all
dancing (well Hawaiian sway) Christmas show
which has something for everyone from a dykey
Sound Of Music and Christmas outings to some
beautifully sung jazz numbers. Lea also includes
in her show the infamous 'Getting To Know
You' section, so if there is anything you've ever
wanted to know about lesbian love or (espe-
cially) sex then she—with her beaver receiver—
is the one to ask. Funny opinions, advice and
generally amusing anecdotes flow from the
crystal implanted in her uterus. For example, to
"those fascist feminists who say you are not a
good lesbian unless you eat humus," she replies:
"There's only one thing you have to eat to be a
lesbian and it's not humus."
Hilarious, riotous, go see it now, or catch her
on Camp Christmas on Channel Four this
Christmas Eve at 10pm.

Beauty and the Beast
Described as a Christmas show for adults with
promo literature declaring "This is no fairy
tale..." and proudly quoting The Sun review
stating " A n appaling vulgar act...Lynam is
banned for life", I thought I was going to be in
for a good evening. I was wrong. Industrial
noise, garbage for a set, incomprehensible
shouting and screaming did not make for a good
opening and it grew progressively worse. It
wasn't that it was rude, excessively violent,
sick, perverted and crazed (although it was all
these things at times), it was just that it was
rubbish. A few selected snippets of audience
interval conversation will show I wasn't the
only one who thought so:
"It's different, I'm quite enjoying it actually."
"I wouldn't say I was enjoying it exactly."
"Well it's nice to see something a bit different
for a change."
"Did you enjoy it?", "Well...I laughed a bit."
I will admit that a couple of scenes were
worth seeing but they weren't worth sitting
through the rest of the show to see. I almost left
at the interval, so unimpressed was I. By the end
of the show, I wished I had.

The School
For Wives
A question is posed: Can a married man avoid
the capriciousness of a wife whose adultery will
lose him his social standing? Arnolphe has
spurned marriage on such grounds because he
had a plan. His knack is to find a simple,
controllable girl who will still do the washing.
The plan progresses. Arnolphe takes a young
ward, Agnes, whose development he restricts to
ensure her affection and loyalty. We enter as he
prepares to tie the knot with his subservience.
Yet in a manner cliqued by love, in walks a
handsome upstart, Horace, who falls for Agnes
and tries to steal the object of Arnolphe's
dignity. Complications abound. Horace doesn't
realise that Agnes is Arnolphe's proposed bride
and so he confides their plans for love to his
protagonist. Can Arnolphe marry before Horace
ruins the innocence of Agnes, or at least turns
her head in distraction?
Ian McDiarmid (Arnolphe), bearer of a broad
snarl, takes the rage and double faced treachery
inherent in his role with some gusto, but it is
Emma Fielding (Agnes) who is the crowned
jewel. She plays a precocious female lead with
the spirit which enhances her already growing
critical reputation.
Whether the basic Moliere plot itself works
is another matter. Perhaps the comedy is a bit
too gentle for a 20th century audience. I laughed
loudest when one of the supporting actresses
came out for the lead's bow by mistake. Theatre
is funniest when it's really real.
