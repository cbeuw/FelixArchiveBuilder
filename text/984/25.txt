Well, we've made it to the last day of term and
there's just over a week left 'til Christmas.
Where did the last eleven weeks go? One minute
it was the start of term and the next thing I know
it's practically Christmas.
Does anyone else feel like it isn't really
Christmas, or is it just me? I know that all the
shops have had their Christmas stuff out since
about September and I am painfully aware that
they are constantly playing tacky Christmas
carols over their P.A.s. Even around College,
Christmas trees have been sprouting up all over
the place and the ceilings have a liberal coating

playing more than the odd one or two Christmas
tunes. But despite all this, it still doesn't feel
particularly festive. It feels like there is
something missing.
Maybe it's because some of the novelty value
Christmas had when I was younger has worn
off. I can still remember the excitement of
putting my stocking at the end of the bed on
Christmas Eve and leaving a mince pie and glass
of sherry out for Santa (not forgetting the carrot
for the reindeer!), knowing that in the morning
there'd be some presents in their place.
It all seems to be too much of a hassle now,
especially the Christmas shopping which I still
have to do and I'm not looking forward to it one
little bit. I never know what to get anyone and
no-one ever seems able to give me any ideas.
And then there's the crowds of Christmas
shoppers to contend with. I don't like crowds at
the best of times, but when they consist of
people just like me rushing around at the last
minute, it's ten times worse. But I'll have to do
it sometime soon and anyway, they say it's
better to give than to receive. I just wish I didn't
have to go through the buying beforehand.
The next Felix is out on Monday 10th January.
The deadlinefor entries is 4th January.
