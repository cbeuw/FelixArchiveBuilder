The Other

Other Two and You
Once upon a time there was a band called New
Order: Bernard, Peter and...the other two. The
Other Two were very sad because no one ever
remembered their names. Then the Fairy
Godmother of electropop waved her wand,
turning some second-rate New Order songs and
a few 'quirky' instrumentals into a glittering
crystal carriage of sound. Unfortunately, at
midnight the slick production dissolved into so
much aural candyfloss. The lyrics didn't help,
possessing all the depth and intelligence of an
amnesiac goldfish, and Prince Charming eloped
with the Ugly Sisters rather than endure
Cinderella's saccharine singing. Moral: i f
someone else in your band gets all the credit,
it's probably because they have all the talent.

Looking for highlights: 'Ambulance Song',
from CSC's new album, is a sleazy, percussive,
almost jazzy track that lays their industrial tag to
rest and promises great things for the future.

Fischer Z
The Borderline
Fischer-Z's set comprised a selection of their
musical styles spanning the 15 years of their
existence. Although they are all expert
musicians, the old inspiration has left them and
the new has evaded them. The bassist was
faultless and the bare chested drummer was
over enthusiastic. John Watts, on lead guitar
and vocals, conducted with precision and
perfection. His intermittent comical quips were
more historical than asides. Maybe their new
album 'Kamikaze Shirt' will have the studio
inspiration that may generate the hyperpulse
activity to make you spend your money.

We are listening to geeks rock. Not, I stress,
Geek Rock—Rosa Mota have just left the stage,
pretty much as they found it. Projecting pictures
impresses no-one if your music has left no trace
and all anyone will remember of tonight's
cacophony are a couple of good ideas wrapped
up in tight crowd-flirting denim.
No, this is the sound of ugly ducks and
anoraks; promless, pompomless, helmetless high
school kids grown up and refuting all that with a
flair. They are the complete antithesis of the
previous band, sassless sirens to the trash
vixens. Rolling waves of cyclic noise out with a
flick, twang, flick of the wrist, then relaxing in
the soft haven of a keyboard swell. Elemental.
Which must be why the idiot mosher is going
mental in front of me. 'Cos it's so quiet and he
has to, like, express himself. By jumping up and
down to a lilting love song. Then again, to a
lullaby. Is he gigging or trampolining? Buy
some lycra then get on your exercise bike.
Actually, when YLT get mad again he's had
enough, the music has moved him so much he
has to discuss beer loudly with his mate.

Shawn Colvin
Royalty Theatre
The road for sales is a meandering one and
Shawn Colvin has trudged her steps with the
reserve of a saint. Fresh from opening for Chris
Isaak and Runrig, it's only fair that she gets to
bang a drum on some stage of her own. Fair and
fine, she is one of the most talented live perfor-
mers around. Crowd banter has been a defining
feature of such trail busters as Nanci Griffith
and current queen, kd lang. It's a hangover from
the days when the storytelling tradition was
stronger in the veins, that's part of country
music. A time when songs were a three and a
half minutes of being somebody else, some
place else.
Although ably supported with bass and
(occasional slide) guitar, it is her reminiscent
voice which hangs brightly overall. A taut line,
swooping in the edginess of Dakotan twang, it
set her distinctive style. Elfin smiles throughout,
torn boy hair with woollen cap, the progression
from the Greenwich coffee houses was evident.
The first encore with Dylan's 'You're Gonna
Make Me Lonesome When You Go' and an icy
version of the band's 'It Makes No Difference'
suggests that Zimmerman's offspring remains in
better shape that the man himself.
