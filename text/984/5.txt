Crosswords: How to Solve Them
This December marks the 80th anniversary of the modem crossword: in 1913, New York World published a diamond-shaped grid devised
by Arthur Wynne. Thus, the modern crossword was born and gradually evolved. Felix has decided to evolve the crossword a little further
by adding another dimension - literally.
How It Works & Why It Is Easier Than Its Normal
2-DimensionaI Cousin
You may have noticed by now that the corners of the next 12 pages are
taken up with 12 crosswords. These make up a 12x12x12 layered cube ...
our crossword grid! The puzzle is solved in exactly the same way as a
standard cryptic crossword with the addition of a set of 'through' clues as
well as the normal 'across' and 'down'. The squares which contain letters
from a 'through' clue are shaded in grey for the solver's convenience.
Don't be daunted! It will soon become apparent that far from being more
complicated, this crossword is actually easier to solve due to the extensive
interlinking of words.
Competition Rules
The closing date for the competition is 12pm on Friday 14th January 1994
- the first Friday back. First place will be awarded to the owner of the most
completed grid and, in the event of any ties, names will be drawn from 'an
item of headwear (3)'.
Points of Reference
Considering the seeming originality of this feat, we thought we should
inform the reader on the compilation of this puzzle.
3D Multi-axial Symmetric Grid Designer: Penguin
Clue Construction: Sphinx (Ed.), Toot, Catfish, Stan, Jaymz and Penguin
(when desperate)
Each layer is 4-way rotationally symmetric in the plane of the page, and the
whole stack is 2-way rotationally symmetric in the other two dimensions.
Errata
1. Day 4, 1-d. As clue Ed. was in bed at the time of going to press, a
substitute clue escaped his attention. The preferred clue is 'Looked at again
as very red Sue is irritated (10)'.
2. Day 3, 14-a. 'Luckily, M P has swallowed pus (5)' not 'puss'.
3. Day 3. Grey square missing at reference 9 along and 9 down.
The complex interlinking of words has (unavoidably) led to one or two
answers which may be considered unorthodox. Rest assured though, all
words/phrases have been thoroughly researched and are English (phew!).
Thanks
Heartfelt thanks go to our generous friends at Collins, Chambers and
Hodder & Stoughton for donating the prizes; Rose for typing in grids; the
Word Perfect spellcheck; whichever dictionary would give us the relevant
words or definitions we wanted and the bottles of Cabernet Sauvignon.
- Happy Puzzling!
