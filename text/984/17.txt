Madder Rose
'Bring It Down'
This melancholy firebomb, the bleeding
contradiction of four falling thirtysomethings, is
a quivering testament to experience. Madder
Rose play guitars like oldies should, only no-one
did it so good yesterday. Peerless. O
Belly Star'
Tanya's talent was obvious with The Throwing
Muses; here, her songs take flight and soar on
angel's wings. A voice like a tarnished halo
charts our descent into the Belly of the Beast,
"...if you bore me, you lose you soul to me..." J

'Tindersticks'
A nicotine-tinged nod to Nancy and Lee.
Lamenting about 'City Sickeness', they pour
whisky over your helpless soul. C
Just a brief word from your ol' befuddled Music
Editor about the composition of this chart. A l l
the reviewers' Top Tens were compiled to get
the main Top Five and then the dilettantes'
choices were reconstructed with the the
aforementioned five albums omitted, if present,
to give their best of the remainder. Easy huh?
Maybe the last word of the term should go to
Mary Lorson from Madder Rose..."my stress it
tends to rise with the sun". How very true. T

'Siamese Dream'
The second album delivered out of the
gutworking of an American myth sees the
Pumpkins tie the knots they left behind. Just one
burst of 'Rocket' or the smiling destiny of
'Spaceboy' should set your heart aflame. T
Suede 'Suede'
"I was born a pantomime horse, Ugly as the sun
when he falls to the floor" - so Brett croons for
me on a prop ridden stage and I shake in time.
The hype was overhyped. For once, believe it. O
