ICAFC Turn On The Style
I C A F C lsts 4 - 0 U C H 1st
The IC 1st team travelled to Sidcup with high
hopes of their first win of the season - they were
playing a team in the division below them in the
cup. Things were not helped when their 'star'
player Alex de Stefano turned up half an hour
late and a typical fifteen minute delay at Charing
Cross Station, these factors meant the team had
to get ready quickly, so there was no time for an
inspired Andy Fenton team talk - this may be
why we won!
From the very first minute, it was obvious the
IC lads were on form. The passing was
excellent, with Ben Willis, Ronald Williams and
Wai Kwok controlling the wings and centre. Ian
Finnerty was like a rock (large and stationary),
and Tellis Botzios was absent. Despite some
dubious refereeing, IC took the lead following a
great move down the left, culminating in a
quality finish from Mike Jarvis. This was soon
followed with a quality finish from Richie
Dixon - he claimed he thought iaces' prior to
shooting.
IC then turned on the style and new-comer
Ike Omanbale scored his first goal for the lsts
and Richie Dixon added another jammy goal
which the keeper should have saved. The lads
could have scored far more, but Mr Dixon took
it upon himself to get his hat-trick and screwed
it up for the rest of the team.
We are now in the quarter finals of the cup,
and have extended our unbeaten run to two
games, so now the captain can't be known as
Andy 'Turnip' Fenton anymore! We would like
to thank Marv Abdo for not playing.
1994 will be a good year!
RCSU Football: Phys vs Maths
Physics 8 - 2 Maths
Last Saturday, 12th December, despite the rain,
the Physics vs Maths football match went ahead.
Considering the weather, the turnout of ten
Physicists and five Mathematicians wasn't bad.
To even the numbers a couple of Physicists
played on the Maths side.
The match took place in a muddy Hyde Park
and the scorers were:
Luke Bolton, Phys 2 (3),
Matt Good, Maths 3 (1),
Paul Harris, Phys 1(1),
Ridzum Kassim, Phys 2(1),
Abdul Said, Phys 2 (3) and
VrataVenet, Phys 2(1).
Thanks to all those who participated and
hopefully we will play again next term. If you
want to play in future games, please drop a note
to Gideon Moont, Phys 2, R C S U Clubs
Committee Chair.
