CINEMA
The Screen Group have seven
cinemas in London, showing a
range of films from home and
abroad. Its repetoire is usually
very up to date with regard to
the many international festival
films presently on tour, whilst
still reserving the late-nights
(on Fridays and Saturdays for
respected cinema classic's
(by contemporary standards).
The Screen On Baker Street
is showing, from now until the
end of the month, two such
'classics'. Eraserhead, by
David Lynch, is an amusing
satire on the surrealist films of
the 50's. Often (incorrectly)
billed as a grotesque and
bizarre horror-movie, this
black and white film subtly
traces the domestic traumas
of an average city-dweller,
against Lynch's own inter-
pretation of the oppressive
environment in which he lives.
Koyanisqaatsi, directed by
Francis Ford Coppola,
essentially attempts the same
thing, by using a collage of
slow and fast film-clips to
illustrate and compare our
natural and man-made
environments. The word,
'Koyanisqaatsi' stems from
theHopi language, meaning'a
crazy life that needs to be
changed'. Predictably, then,
Coppola's visual statements
are bound to be abstract and
So Little Red Riding Hood
hits the big screen and
encounters were-wolves, real
wolves, Granny, and worst of
all, men who's eye-brows
meet. And certainly our
heroine, (Sarah Patterson),
copes with all of them and her
role admirably.
The film takes the format of
stories told within the
heroine's dream and uses
considerable originality, a
combination of poetic (or was
it just plain ugly?) horror and
fairy-tale fantasy, along with
the undertones (even if
inconsistent) of our 13-year-
old h e r o i n e ' s s e x u a l -
awakening.
Neil Jordan (the director),
fills the film with some
obtuse, but there is a lot of
humour in the film (not all of it
intentional) and, whilst Philip
Glass' accompanying orche-
stral work is uninspiring in
parts, it adds greatly to the
astounding visual effects that
Coppola has captured on film.
The current trend in
f a c e l i f t i n g 50's kitsch
continues unabated. In recent
months we have seen our
black and while cinema
heroes decked out in Dulux
Non-Drip Video Glare with
soundtrack to match, whilst
the silents are given voice by
such groups as Cine-
Chimera, an international jazz
company, playing a series of
improvisations over anything
from Hitchcock to Man Ray.
Now comes 'Metropolis', the
1984-remake by Giorgio
Moroder of the science-fiction
epic of 1926, directed by Fritz
Lang, but with a Dolby Stereo
soundtrack featuring artists
such as Freddie Mercury, Pat
Benatar and Adam Ant.
Unfortunately this is not the
first time this has happened.
The film has already been
subjected to James Brown
(60's and free heavyfunk form
jazz) from Cine-chimera, but
this latest assault on
Langenstein's monster, whilst
certainly different, could put a
stop to this sort of thing for
good. The film starts next
week at the Screen On The
Hill, NW3.
splendid visuals. Also, when
Jordan chooses to convert
dreamy fantasy into stark
horror, he creates scenes,
with the help of Christopher
Tucker's special make-up
effects, which leave you
clutching your seat with your
eyes transfixed.
The film is satisfying,
though it lacks unity. The
episodes do not collate
comfortably nor are they all
consistant to one theme, and
there is a problem with the
script. But on further
reflection, you may think that
all this doesn't matter very
much, as the film is so
captivating.

The Cars: Drive
An awful lot has changed
for the Cars, since 'Best
Friend's Girl', with a new lead
singer, they also have a
complete change of style.
'Drive' is an excellently
produced track from a superb
album unfortunately, after a
while, this is boring.
Everything But The Girl:
Native Land
'Each and Every One'
showed that an 'indie' style
song can be successful if
promoted by a major label.
'Native Land' is a similar piece;
perhaps too similar. "After a
Freshers Week of almost zero
sleep, I'm too tired to
appreciate intellectual songs
like this. What's the point
anyway? Music's meant to be
fun.
M & M: Cooling The Medium
'Martha & The Muffins', now
shortened to 'M & M', release
this second single from their
album 'mystery walk'. It's
undoubtedly not as good as
'Black Stations, White
Stations' and comparing it to
' E c h o B e a c h ' is l i k e
comparing Southside Refect-
ory to the Cafe Royal. Still, IC
Radio Megastar, Chris Martin,
says the B Side is brilliant.
Some people have no taste!
Julian Lennon: Too Late For
Goodbyes
Julian Lennon has almost
as good a voice as his Father,
although it lacks the hardened
edge of classics like 'Give
Peace A Chance'. Phil
Ramone has produced a
sugary sweet song more
reminiscent of 'Woman'. That
might be OK, but you have to
remember at Julian's age,
John Lennon was writing
'Help' and 'Standing There',
not clever Radio 2 stuff like
this.
Feargal Sharkey: Listen To
Your Father
This is Feargal's first single
since 'Never Never" with the
'Assembly', and is of the same
ilk. I really don't know about
this one. It's a dead good song
it's a probable hit, I just wish
he was still with t h e
Undertones.
The Company of
Wolves
Little Red Riding Hood meets wolves, were-wolves and, worst of
all, men whose eyebrows meet in the middle.
