WHEN YOUR
FAST IS OVER
Work out how much you would have spent on
the meals or food you missed, or if you are being
sponsored there are full details on the sponsorship
forms.
Collect together the appropriate amount and
send it to the Oxfam Area Office.
The money is used in small-scale development
projects in the Third World which Oxfam supports.
The amounts needed are often not great, but make
a world of difference.
£2.87 buys a hoe for a young farmer in Tanzania.
£5.50 buys 5 kilos of bean seed for a poor family in
North East Brazil.
£9.00 pays for the appropriate training of 3 village
farmers in India.
