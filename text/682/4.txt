COMEDY
Near disaster was averted last
week as the main band at the
Fresher's Ball were unaware of
the event until four hours before
the start. Despite being contacted
two months in advance, the
agency who booked the group,
Misty in Roots, forgot to remind
them of the gig. Inspite of this
crisis Freshers week was deemed
a complete success by Ents
chairman, Dave Allen as well as
the sabbatical officers. The profit
for the week was about £1000,
slightly higher than expected and
for the first time in a number of
years there were no complaints
from the Police or local residents.
T h e week s t a r t e d , not
suprisingly, on Monday with the
traditional New Year's party.
This event attracted about 800
people and featured an excellent
concert by the Higsons.
On Tuesday night the ever
popular Life Sciences party took
place in the J C R . This was
reported even fuller then usual
with music provided by the Ents
disco. The only serious casualty
was a window in one of the doors.
Thursday nights' films The
Hunger and Brainstorm did not
attract as many people as
anticipated. This could have been
because some Freshers may not
have realised that their £8 week
ticket entitled them to free entry.
The highlight of the week was
the Fresher's Ball on Friday,
however it came close to being a
complete disaster. The main
problem was that Misty in Roots,
the star attraction did not know
they had a gig until four o'clock
on that Friday afternoon. A n
additional problem was the
absence of a P A system.
Following frantic phone calls the
band were assembled and a small
but suitable PA obtained leading
to only a slightly delayed opening
to the Ball.
The event attracted about 800
people who packed out the two
discos and concerts by Rent
Party, the popular jazz band and
of course Misty in Roots who
went down very well despite
being virtually unprepared.
Several films were also shown
throughout the night. Apart
from a few attempts to climb in
through windows there was no
trouble and on the whole the
Freshers Ball was an enjoyable
event for everyone.
T h e t e m p t a t i o n w h e n
reviewing comedy acts is to
try and be funny. Suffice to
say (for those who went), I
was the easy-rider motorbike.
Intrigued? Read on...
The evening went off with a
semi-fizz, going by the name
of Rory Bremmer whose deft if
not daring 'man-of-many-
faces' act left me pretty cold
but got trre audience warmed
up for things to come.
S c e n e II b r o u g h t t h e
amazing 'Skint Video' whose
lyrical Smiths take-off—The
Jones (plus bay leaves in the
back pocket) and an adroit
Springsteen number'Hereyes
were running ...down her
neck' a radioactive ballad,

N I G H T
were spot-on. With a little
voice training these boys will
go far.
The amber nectar during
the break brought out of the
woodwork what was to prove
a m o s t p r o f o u n d a n d
worthwhile poet-comedian,
John Hegley. H e didn't say
anthing particularly funny for
the twenty minutes he was on,
but this devastating cynicism
and mundane observational
poetry brought more laughs
and spontaneous applause
then the rest put together.
His book 'Visions of the
Bone Idol' is well worthwhile
for anyone who is bored of
reading train-tickets.
Last came the act that I
assume everyone had been
waiting for ' T h e V i s c i o u s
Boys', winners of the 1984
Time Out street entertainers
festival. This pair are now
l o c a l l y f a m o u s , n e i g h ,
nationally famous since their
slow-motion 'Chariots of Fire'
appeared on the box.
They are amusing, its no
good denying that, but they
enjoy themselves too much.
Too many of their sketches
fell flat. When I first saw them
in Convent Garden I thought
they were verging on the
'visionary', but I'm not sure
fame and bringing the aqt on
to the stage has done a lot for
them.
I hope that in a couple of
months I'll be able to stumble
across them again in Convent
G a r d e n , doing something
else, just as original.
At the start someone yelled
'I'm gonna laugh even if it kills
me'. There were no corpses
left lying around at the end, so
I assume he didn't find it too
hard. There is no doubt that
the evening was a success.

Shoppers in trendy Covent Garden were suprised to find a bunch of
layabouts from Guilds Union there last Saturday. However, always
friendly and welcoming, the toffs responded with custard pies in the
face! Fortunately they also responded with cash. City and Guilds
Union raised over £80 for IC Rag from their efforts during Freshers'
Week.
