Down and Out: Orwell's
London and Paris Revisited by
Sandy Craig and Chris
Schwarz (Penguin)
This is one of the most
gripping books of social
conflict that I have ever read. It
is an alarming and worrying
record of homelessness that
should not be ignored.
The photographs that are
for some obscure reason
placed at the rear of the book,
are some of the best black and
white photographs that I have
ever seen. They show the
alarming conditions in which
many single people live. There
is no attempt to create any
happy smiling tramps with
t h e r e p o s s e s i o n s in a
handkerchief on the end of a
r o d . T h e s e p h o t o g r a p h s
instead remove any illusions
about the romantic tramp one
might of had. This review of
the photographs may seem a
little over the top but they are
simply superb. If you don't
want to buy it then I recomend
that you go down toyour local
bookshop and just look at
these photographs.
Although the text is and
c o u l d be a s i n s t a n t l y
interesting as the photo-
graphs, it is still a masterly
piece of journalism. The
introduction gives a few of the
facts about the homeless in
this country so that one gets
some idea of the scale of the
problem. However this is not,
and doesn't attempt to be, a
c o m p l e t e s u r v e y of the
problem. Instead it is a series
of short stories about the
homeless interspersed with
some of Orwell's original
writings. These stories are
moving in that one can often
see how, had the circum-
stances been different one
could have ended up in the
streets. This is no exagger-
ation because many of these
people have come from the
middle classes like me, and I
guess you. They have been to
ordinary schools and they
have been brought up by
ordinary parents.
By this time you are prob-
ably thinking that these home-
less are just a bunch of
scroungers and layabouts.
Some of them are, but many of
them despise handouts and
desperately look for jobs. This
book removes a lot of illusions
about people taking advant-
age of the welfare state.
If you are one of blinkered
sort of people who believe that
everyone has opportunities
and that people create there
own problems you should
probably ignore the text and
just look at the photos. Carry
on living in your ivory tower
and sweeping social problems
under the carpet (sorry about
the cliches). However if you
want to be challenged to
improve the situation why not
go our and buy it.
One slight criticism, afterall
this praise, about the timing.
Why did it have to be launched
in 1984 when it will be lost in
the Orwell overkill.
Ashes in the Mouth: The Story
of the Body-Line Tour 1932-
33 by Ronald Mason
(Penguin)
Ever since David Putman
announced that the sequel to
Chariots of Fire would be a
film about Bodyline, the
interest in the test series has
risen enormously. Already
there have been several books
o n the s u b j e c t a n d an
Australian TV series. This
book is the best of the books
on this subject I've read,
however it is definitely aimed
at cricket fans.
T h e u n i n it i a t e d a r e
probably already wondering
what the Bodyline Bowling
series was anyway. It was a
series of cricket tests in which
an English side lead by
Douglas Jardine defeated an
Australian side using a tactic
k n o w as b o d y l i n e . T h e
Australians objected to it as
they c o n s i d e r e d that it
involved the English bowling
at their batsmen's bodies. The
E n g l i s h c o n s i d e r e d it
legitimate as the laws of
cricket didn't ban it. That
probably hasn't explained it
very well but if you want to
find out more there are plenty
of histories of cricket that
explain it fuller.
Back to the review. This isn't
the book for the. uninitiated
because it assumes too
detailed a knowledge of
cricket. For example if you
don't know who Harold
Larwood is you might become
a little confused.
To the cricket fan, though, it
is a godsend. It is an informed
but almost totally unbiased
account of the series. It is well
written and clear. The one
thing it lacks is a few of the
anecdotes that give a cricket
book life. In the introduction
Mr M a s o n says that he
interviewed many of the
survivors of the series and it is
a pity that he couldn't have
used their a n e c d o t e s . I
recomend it as a good buy for
any cricket fans.
