Fire alarm
farce
continues
Fire alarms in Southside went off fifteen times over the
weekend, and both residents and security guards are now
ignoring these alarms. This follows a report in last week's
FELIX dealing with the problems with the firealarm
system.
The alarms started going off at
about 6.00pm Saturday and by
midnight had gone off fourteen
times. These alarms are believed
to have been caused by residents
cooking in their rooms.
At about 6.30am on Sunday
the alarms went off again. This
time it was caused by a smoker in
the IC Radio studio. The
students present in the studio
worried that security guards
turned the bells off without
coming to check on the reason
for the alarm. It is unusual for the
IC Radio studio to be in use at the
time of the alarm, and the room
contains a lot of electrical
equipment. Station Manager
Peter Coleman felt that the alarm
could well have been genuine and
that the matter should have been
investigated at the time.
Security Officer, Geoffrey
Reeves, is now investigating as to
why. the alarm was apparently
ignored.
In a further incident yesterday
morning the fire alarms in the
Beit Building went off. A n
intruder alarm was recently
installed in the animal room in
Zoology. Those legitimately
entering the room have nine
seconds to cancel the alarm
before it goes off. A user of the
room failed to cancel the alarm in
time. It seems that this intruder
system has been connected to the
fire alarm system, and it was
taken to be a fire alarm by most
of those in the building.
