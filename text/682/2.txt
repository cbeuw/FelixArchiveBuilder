Angry Bull
To the Editor of London Student
Dear Editor
After taking great pains to warn as many
students as possible at Imperial about
'cowboy' insurance firms, and Students &
Graduate Financial Planning Division in
particular, I was pretty bloody annoyed to
find London Student carrying advertising
material for them.
U L U has known about their operations for
at least a year, to my knowledge, and in fact
has policy against the above company. I hope
that you are prepared to help any student that
is conned into parting with their money.
I don't want to hear excuses, I would like to
see something in your next issue, prominently
placed, to set the record straight.
Yours Very Angrily,
Ian Bull
President
Soft Soap
Dear Sir,
I would just like it to be known, how much
I like the pleasantly pastel pink, fragrant,
liquid soap that has appeared in the college
toilets over the summer. Three' cheers for
Estates!
Yours sincerely

Mixcd-up
Mooncy
Dear Sir,
After reading your article in last weeks
F E L I X about Mooney's lamb and beef mix-
up, I was reminded about an incident earlier
last year. Vegetarians were sitting down to
their evening dinner in Linstead Hall when
some began to voice querries about what they
had been served: it looked like chicken and
tasted as such. The Kitchen staff were
questioned as to whether the dish was meat or
some ingenious soya substitute. Amid
confusion, the meals were rapidly recalled
and five minutes later, hastily prepared
omelettes appeared.
If M r Mooney's staff are unable to
differtiate between meat and veg who knows
what may be dumped on our tables?
Yours sincerely
William Mordannt

FELIX
Sound and fury,
signifying nothing
There is no fire alarm in Southside Halls of
residence.
In the event of a fire, there is no doubt that
the residents would ignore the alarm bells
c o m p l e t e l y — w i t h w h a t e v e r t r a g i c
consequences that would bring.
But the problems with the alarm highlight
more than a danger to our safety. They also
highlight an extraordinary, apparent lack of
concern among those whose job it is to ensure
our safety.
It seems incredible that at this college of
Science and Technology it is impossible to
install an efficient fire alarm, to say nothing
of an efficient telephone system. If the bells
on the fire alarm rang a little less, and the
bells on the telephone rang a little more, a lot
of us would be much happier.
A system that rings fifteen false alarms in
two days- is in no sense a fire alarm; will there
have to be a real fire in Southside before
anything is done to put the system right?
