Another
cock-up,
Christine?
Union clubs and societies will
have their budgets cut as the
result of an oversight by last
year's I C U Deputy President,
Christine Teller. At yesterday's
U n i o n Finance Committee
(UFC) the present Deputy
President, Dave Parry, reported
that officers had overestimated
the Union's income by £6500.
When the Union presented its
claim to Governing Body it asked
for a 9% increase in its
subvention. This comprised a
3.8% general rise to account for
inflation and £6500 to cover the
extra costs of affiliation to the
University Athletics Union
(UAU). College agreed to this
rise and told the Union that the
subvention, including the U A U
money, was to be £228,750.
Unfortunately the sabbatical
officers misinterpreted this and
thought that the amount did not
include the £6,500 which they
believed to be seperate.
M r Parry warned major sub-
committee chairmen, who are
responsible for clubs' finances,
their claims would have to be
reassesed. He also warned that
contingency awards could only
be made in cases of real
emergency.
This error is the third made by
Miss Teller which has been
revealed since she left College.
Freshers' F E L I X reported that
ICU Council had not been asked
to approve the annual estimates
last year as required by the Union
By-Laws. Had this been done it is
possible the over estimate of
Union income would have come
to light earlier.
Miss Teller also cut the
Postgraduate Group's grant
from £560 to £100 for the year
without consulting the P G
Chairman, Chris Hendy. This
was despite the fact that M r
Hendy had told Miss Teller that
as the Group had plans for
increased activity it would
require at least the same level of
funding that it received in
previous years. This mistake was
rectified at yesterday's U F C
when a motion provisionally
giving the P G Group a budget of
£1000 was passed.
Climbing wallfor IC?
Plans to build a climbing wall for
IC students are going ahead after
a year's delay. The project, likely
to cost about £5000, will provide
opportunity for mountain-
climbing practice, and will be
only the second of its kind in
London. The Queensgate Trust
will provide the money for
building the wall.
The climbing wall, which is to
be situated behind Weeks Hall,
will be made of pre-fabricated
concrete bolted to a steel frame,
all assembled on site. It will
consist of a central concrete slab,
with two peripheral 'cracks'. A
belay rail will run along the top,
and a ladder will be provided
adjacent to the wall.
The plan is to use the sunken
garden at the back of Weeks.
This will allow the use of the wall
to be confined to students, as
they will have to go through the
Hall to get access. For safety
reasons student s will not be
permitted to climb alone.
Planning permission is soon to
be sought from Westminister
City Council. The present plans
have been drawn up by IC
Estates Section.
A similar wall built at Brunei
University led to two students
falling to their death, soon after it
was built.
PROPOSED POSITION

Those of you who have had
occasion to use the new
telephone system can not have
failed to notice that so far it's
been suffering from more than a
few 'teething problems'.
Instruments which have been
working okay suddenly go dead,
others have yet to be connected at
all. Conversations can be cut off
in the middle for no apparent
reason, one-way communication
can occur when making a call —
you can hear them, but they can't
hear you!. The installation of the
new system has hardly been a
great advertisement for British
Telecom's wonderful new
equipment.
But at least part of the blame
for the disruption must lie with
the College rather than BT.
During the first few weeks of the
new system's operation when an
incoming call was lucky enough
to get t h r o u g h to the
switchboard, the operators
seemed to have no idea about
which extension to connect it to.
Clearly they should have had a
list of old external, numbers
against new numbers as well as a
list of new numbers against the
name of the person or office to
which they belong. Such lists are
available on the exchange's
computer, but were no-where
near complete at the time the new
system came into operation. And
the parts of the list that were
ready contained numerous
errors. For example, during the
first two weeks or more many
calls to the Union Office were put
through to the Crush Bar phone
which is situated on the second
floor landing of the central
staircase in the Union Building.
I'm sure that in a few months
time when everything's working
smoothly the new system will be a
great improvement on the old
exchanges, but at the moment it's
a standing joke (even used by the
R e c t o r at the F r e s h e r s '
Reception). More seriously, it's
a l s o a cause o f g r e a t
inconvenience, and embarass-
ment to everyone who's had to
apologise to an incoming caller
for the time they've wasted in
getting t h r o u g h . N o - o n e
involved in organising the
changeover comes out of it with.
much credit.
