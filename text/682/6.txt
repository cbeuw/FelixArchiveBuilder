The people listed below have been allocated parking permits for the 84/85
session. Permits will be available for collection from the Union Office from 9.30 on
Monday, hopefully we will also have barrier key cards although these are not
necessary at the moment due to the lack of a barrier.
Applicants whose names do not appear on the list may appeal against the decision
by coming to the Union Office and completing an appealsform. Appeals will not be
accepted from people who did not originally apply. Appeals must be made by
5.30pm on Friday 19 October.
Permits not collected by the close of appeals time will be re-allocated.

Entertainments and Rag
I hopethat you'veenjoyed and
recovered from the excesses
of Freshers' Week etc. There's
lots more of the same later in
the term in Rag Week. I would
like to thank the Ents crew
especially Dave Allen, Nick
O'Hagan, Dave Lock, Ian
T h o m a s , A n d y M e e s o n ,
Charlie Troupe, Barry, and
Christine Taig (apologies to
t h o s e n o t s p e c i f i c a l l y
m e n t i o n e d ) f o r all their
efforts. They do far more work
than they get credit for.
Don't forget Tiddleywinks
tomorrow morning. Last year
w e r a i s e d £ 2 , 4 0 0 f o r

Undesir able Insurance
Agents
I know I have mentioned this
before, and I hopethat I won't
h a v e t o a g a i n . S o m e
Insurance Companies seem
to think that students are fair
game for ripping off. O n e in
particular, by the name of
Student & Graduate Financial
Planning Division, has been
heavily criticised in previous
y e a r s f o r t h e i r s a l e s
techniques and inappropriate
policies offered. L o n d o n
S t u d e n t N e w s p a p e r h a s
recently carried advertising
materials for them, and the
letters page gives some idea
of my reaction to that.
Please, for your own sakes,
don't have anything to do with
them, and don't let them in or
invite them into your hall c
house.
