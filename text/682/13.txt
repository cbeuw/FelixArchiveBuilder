Summer
At Henley this year IC had two
crews entered, one in the Ladies
Challenge Plate, the other in the
Visitors' Challenge Cup. The
former of the two crews beat
Newcastle University in the first
round but were beaten by
University of Washington in the
second round. The coxless four
in the Visitors' beat Upper
Canada College and Yale
University but were beaten by
Shiplake College/Sir William
Borlases in the semi-final.
During the summer members
of the club won several events.
Success
At Henley Town an Elite coxless
four w o n their event. P
McConnell won the Novice
Sculls at Ross-on-Wye, and at
Chester long distance sculls Bill
Downing won the Sen B event
and Jeff Hunt won the Sen C
event. The best result of the
summer was probably the Pairs
Head, Open Coxless win by Bill
Downing and John Griffiths. Bill
Mason the boatman and Dave
Rendle came second in the same
event, three seconds behind the
winning IC pair.
Ladies
7 a side
As usual, nobody wanted to get
up for 8.>30am on a Sunday
morning: it rained as well.
IC managed, however, to field
two teams using 11 players. Each
side played five matches, winning
two, drawing four and losing
three, with one walk over.
This proved to be enough to
see us safely on our way —
home!
Thanks to everyone who
played, especially Sandra for her
three goals and Sascha for
bravery beyond the call of duty.
And last but not least Jackie and
Anne for their rugby skills.
Team: Liz, Kim, Sarah,
Sascha, Clare, Anne S, AnneB,
Jackie, Sandra, Alice, Louise.
SNOOKER
IC Team
Weakened
Lensbury 'A'—9 IC—3
The snooker season at IC began
with a m o o d of guarded
pessimism. The reserve strength
is not of the standard of last year,
and with two of the first team
choice missing it was a much
weakened team that took on the
strong Lensbury side.
The match started with IC
losing the first four frames,
suggesting that a whitewash was
on the cards. Although the team
recovered to a 4—2 scoreline, in
the end IC had only taken three
of the twelve frames.
Not abn auspicious start to the
season but certainly not a
disaster and a return to full
strength should bring IC a few
results in matches to come.
The Freshers' Tournament was
held on Sunday and resulted in a
2—1 win for Javed Qureshi over
Alan Boswell.
