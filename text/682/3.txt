Adams

Lecture
Richard Adams, the author of
Watership Down was the guest
speaker at the first of this years
Wellsoc lectures.
He was presented to the floor
by D r Sinclair Goodlad who, for
the benefit of newcomers gave an
introduction to the society as well
as speaking of some of the
subjects covered in previous
years which included an over
enthusiastic explosives expert as
well as the pioneering laser
display.
M r Adams, a civil servant until
he retired recently, displayed a
lively sense of humour launching
into a discourse, that at times was
most passionate, on the topic of
relationships between man and
animals.
In a w e l l m a r s h a l l e d
argu ment he first drew attention
to the scale of mans destruction
of the environment with a
catalogue of biological woe. The
main causes of this were isolated
as being the huge population
increases and the advances in the
field of weaponry. It was held by
M r Adams morally indefensible
that man should inflict suffering
and death merely because he has
the power to do so. As far as
other species are concerned it
would be best if man were to
disappear from the face of the
earth, he said.
Following this there was a
discussion on the foundations of
our society. The Greeks were
credited with the inventing of
thought and reasoning, the
Romans with the supremacy of
law, the Jews with ethics and
Jesus with compassion. The way
in which these elements affect our
life in general and attitude to
animals in particular was
examined.
It was concluded that if we, as
humans, exploit animals for our
own advantage, it must follow
from our compassion that the
minimun suffering possible is
inflicted. It was also stated that
the killing of any creature for any
reason other than absolute need
is morally wrong. Ironically, it
came to light during the
discussion that M r Adams does
in fact fish.
Rowing
Peru
There will ba a challenge for an
Imperial College coxed four
when on Sunday 14 October they
will do a sponsored row from
Henley-upon-Thames to Putney
embankment.
This fifty mile 'Sunday outing'
will include seventeen locks just
to add a bit of light relief. The
aim of the row is to raise money
for the boat club and funds to
enable V a l Snewin (who
graduated in Biochemistry this
June) to go on Operation
Raleigh.
Operation Raleigh is a four
year expedition round the world,
upon which Val has been offered
a place as Microbiologist for the
first year. She will be based on
board the research vessel in
North, Central and South
America.
The costs involved are £10 a
day and after vigorous fund
raising and working in a lab for
three months, Val is hoping to
raise some of the remaining £700
