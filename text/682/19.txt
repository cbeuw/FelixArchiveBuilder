OXFAM'S CAMPAIGN FOR JUSTICE NOT HUNGER
Hungry for Change â€” A Campaign for Justice
not Hunger is Oxfam's major new national
Campaign, and its most ambitious yet. There
are many ways to become involved in, and
informed about, the Campaign.
Take part in a range of local activities like the
Hungry for Change survey. Buy the new
Oxfam report outlining the problems and the
real causes of world hunger, and what we in
the UK can do. Everyone who becomes
involved receives the "Hungry for Change
newsletter", keeping you up to date with the
latest developments.

Take a stand against hunger. Choose any
or all of these options, but please don't choose
to do nothing. Thankyou.
