Falcons win first trophy in four years
The minibus was full of
excitement and anticipation
as club driver Rhys guided it
down the M40 to Slough where the
Falcons were to play in the inaugural
National University Baseball Fall
Cup organised by Baseball Softball
UK (BSUK). The off-season had seen
fantastic recruitment, particularly
in the pitching department and this
team represented the best chance yet
that the Falcons had of securing that
vaunted Fall Cup Shield which they
last won in 2010.
Things were looking a little shaky in
the warm up drills, but thankfully the
Falcons found their groove for the
first game against Southampton. The
team as a whole was the beneficiary
of some erratic pitching from our
opponents, and patient battings led
to 8 walks and 1 free base due to a
hit batter. This allowed the Falcons
to pile on the runs with a total of 16
scoring on 7 hits thanks to Ashley,
Zack, Yuki, Patrick, Vincent, Ben and
Min. Chris did well to hit a strong
line drive to right field that was
somewhat magically scooped up by
Southampton’s right fielder inches
from the ground.
On the defensive side, the Falcons
were impeccable with a perfect 1.00
fielding percentage. Pitchers Yuki
Fujita and Zack Wang combined
to shutout the Mustangs and gain
the win for the Falcons in the first
game. With a +16 run differential, the
Falcons were now at the top of the
table for the first time in 4 years.
The next game against the UCLU
Capitals was a much closer affair as
Falcon bats went strangely silent
with only 4 hits the entire game.
Nevertheless, the Falcon’s fielding
and pitching pulled through again
with another fantastic performance
by Zack Wang on the mound striking
out 3 batters and allowing only 2
runs in the first 4 innings before
closer Eduardo came in to finish the
last inning with 3 easy outs despite 2
inconsequential walks. The Falcons
again showed their mettle on the
field with yet another 1.00 showing
on the field, securing the win 8-2
despite mustering less hits than their
opponents.
The third game started off a very
tight affair, With the Falcons first
up to bat, leadoff Ashley and second
batter Eduardo both grounded out
to the left side of the field. Third
baseman Patrick stepped up and was
lucky to get on base from an error by
the Thieves’ first baseman. A stolen
base later, he was in scoring position
and left-fielder Yuki smashed in a
double to bring him home before
Zack grounded out to first base. With
the score at 1-0, pitcher Eduardo,
gave a fantastic showing on the
mound, gaining a 1-2-3 inning with
2 strikeouts to bring the Falcons
back to bat. Things started off well
for the Falcons with first baseman
Ben hitting a triple to get in scoring
position. Catcher Vincent Li then
grounded out to the pitcher, giving
the Thieves their first out. Then,
in a squeeze play right out of the
highlight reel, Second baseman Rhys
Jones laid down a perfect bunt to
score Ben and made it to first. The
score was now 2-0 with the Falcons
in the lead. However, right field
Jacques would then strike out to give
the Thieves their second out. Leadoff
Ashley stepped up to the plate again
and started off a 2-out rally with a
big double behind centre field which
was followed by hits from second,
third and fourth batters which
brought in a further 4 runs before
Zack grounded out to first to end the
inning. The Falcons were now 6-0
ahead and looking very strong on the
field. Nottingham’s biggest batter
then stepped up in a big way with a
solo home run over the centerfield
fence before Eduardo closed out an
otherwise uneventful inning against
the remaining batters. In the top of
the third, the Falcons continued to
pile on the runs with Ben, Vincent,
Chris and Ashley all coming round
to score, bringing the Falcons to an
unassailable 10-1 lead. The game
would end in two more innings with
the Falcons closer Zack closing out
the game for the save despite giving
up 2 runs to bring the score to 11-3.
The final round robin game for the
Falcons came on Sunday against last
year’s Spring Cup champions, the
UEA Blue Sox.
The chilly weather was getting to
everyone and it was evident in the
erratic pitching of starter Zack as
well as a series of uncharacteristic
fielding errors from everyone that
allowed UEA to score 2 runs in the
first inning. Nevertheless, the Falcons
came back strongly to knock 7 in for
a mercy rule inning in the bottom
of the first that was helped along
hugely by a UEA pitcher that could
only manage 6 strikes for the inning
and singles from Eduardo, Stephane
and Ashley. The top of the second
however, showed that the Falcons
themselves weren’t immune to the
weather as UEA knocked them right
back for a mercy rule inning with
Zack struggling to find the strike
zone. The Falcons then came back
again with a second straight mercy
rule inning of their own, helped along
by singles from Patrick and Min and
a massive two run line-drive homer to
left field from Yuki.
The Falcons were now up 14-9 and
with Zack finally finding the strike
zone in the top of the third, they
managed to get out of the inning with
only 3 runs scored.
As the bottom of the third came
round, the Falcons were 10 minutes
from securing the win on time,
having batted second.
Patient batting from all batters saw
the inning drag past the 10 minute
mark as the Falcons scored one off
a wild pitch, bringing the Falcons
into their first final in 4 years with a
perfect unbeaten record in the round
robin.
Nerves must have got to the Falcons
in their first big game however,
and they gave up 6 runs in the top

ICBC CHAIR
SnowSports or No Sports: The Gnarliest club on campus
For centuries, humans have
pondered the possibility of having
fun in Winter. We have now found
the answer strapping a plank of wood
to your feet and trying to traverse
down a snowy hill, also known as
Skiing and Snowboarding…. and
your Snowsports club with the help
of Oliver Wynam is here to help you
experience what many are calling the
greatest thing since sliced bread.
On Wednesday 8th of October
ICSC ventured to Milton Keynes
to partake in the first ritual of the
year. Upon arriving in the ghost
town that is Milton Keynes ICSC
and the London SnowOp were ready
to rip up the slope! We were blessed
by the gods and there was no one
else that evening (Yeah, we rented
out the whole slope to ourselves). It
was a night filled with high speed
and acrobatics with a slope style
and slalom course set up just for us.
Unfortunately the night came to an
end but no one had to fear because we
will have many more awesome events
organised this year.
The committee have been working
away to plan a busy season for all you
lovely people. To name just a few
things planned for you this year we
have BUDS (massive competition in
Edinburgh), Kings Race series, BUISC
(indoor inter-uni competition),
regular racing and freestyle training
sessions, our incredible trips in the
Christmas and Easter Holidays and
of course more socials than you can
shake a ski at.
Whether you’re a seasoned vet or a
novice curious to discover the joys of
snow sports and the intricacies of the
quasi-religious subculture of snow
worship that goes with it, we have
something for you. Starting with the
beginners, we run lessons at Hemel
Hempstead snow dome during term
time before the Christmas and Easter
holidays to get you up to speed with
the basics before the trip and we offer
an excellent beginners package on
the trip. For those of you who have
skied or boarded before we have
regular racing and freestyle sessions
throughout the year, which are a great
opportunity to hone your skills. Both
racing and freestyle sessions are open
to everyone who has any previous
experience on the snow (i.e. can get
down a slope by themselves safely), so
don’t think you aren’t good enough,
it’s a great opportunity to improve.
This year we are pleased to
announce our new partnership with
the management consultancy firm
Oliver Wyman. If you are interested
in possibly pursuing a career in
this sector, take a look at their
fantastic opportunities either in the
sponsorship section of ICSC’s website
or at oliverwyman.com/careers.
Together we are working towards
making this year one of the best in

of the first with a series of hugely
uncharacteristic errors. From then
on, UEA never looked back as dismal
hitting from the Falcons saw them
only getting on the scoreboard in the
bottom of the third off a line-drive
single from Patrick coupled with 2
stolen bases and a wild pitch. The
Blue Sox continued to pile on the runs
as starter Yuki had trouble finding
the zone and soon the score had
become 11-1 . With things looking
grim for the Falcons, a two out rally
started again in the bottom of the
fourth with Ashley getting on base off
a single to the opposite field before
stealing two bases and coming home
off a passed ball. Patrick drew the
walk to get on base and subsequently
came home on a wild pitch after two
stolen bases.
Yuki then drew another walk and
came home on another wild pitch
before Jacques struck out to end the
Falcon’s hopes of victory.
Despite the dismal final, lots
of positives were taken from the
competition, with huge improvement
from last year’s new players, Rhys,
Stephane and Min.
And as the Falcons celebrate their
first trophy position in 4 years, the
sights are set firmly on the National
University Softball Championships
on the 18th of October where the
Falcons will be aiming to expand
their trophy collection.
ICSC’s history so now is definitely the
time to get involved.
