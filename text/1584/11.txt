Imagine a condition that affects
18 million people world-wide.
Imagine a condition with a
fatality rate of up to 60%. Imagine
that 37,000 people a year die in this
country because of it. There is no
specific cure. What treatment there
is can take weeks to come into effect
and can often cause problems of its
own. Every year, 100,000 people in
the UK (and their families) don’t have
to imagine this terrible scenario. The
condition, sepsis, is very real and very
deadly.
Sometimes referred to as
septicaemia, sepsis is a severe
condition that results in more than
100,000 people in the UK being
hospitalised annually. Commonly
known as blood poisoning, it occurs
when microbes (usually bacteria)
invade the bloodstream, causing
inflammation and organ damage.
It can quickly develop into septic
shock, in which blood pressure drops
to a dangerously low level. 60% of
patients are likely to die.
The most effective way to treat
severe sepsis is using antibiotics
specifically targeted against the
bacteria in the blood. Unfortunately,
it can take several days to determine
the best drugs to use, and, with the
patient’s condition deteriorating
rapidly, treatment must begin
immediately with less effective
broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Now imagine that sepsis had a
seemingly miraculous cure. This too,
is now becoming reality. This year,
scientists from Wyss Institute for
Biologically Inspired Engineering,
Boston and Harvard Medical School
have collaborated to produce ‘the
bio-spleen’. Their design is simple; to
employ magnets to remove the sepsis
causing bacteria from the blood in
just a few hours.
Their inspiration came from
within the body itself. The device
acts as an artificial spleen, which can
automatically remove toxins and
pathogens from the blood without
identifying the infection first.
The artificial spleen’s design is as
elegant as its concept. It works by
attaching the device to the veins of
the infected individual and taking
the blood out of the body, much
like a dialysis machine, then extra-
corporeally mixing the blood of the
infected individual with magnetic
nanobeads coated with an engineered
human opsonin-mannose-binding
lectin (MBL).
MBL recognizes carbohydrate
patterns found on the surface of a
large number of pathogenic micro-
organisms, including bacteria,
viruses, protozoa and fungi. When
the offending toxins and pathogens
have been captured they are removed
from the blood by magnets, the
‘clean’ blood is then returned to the
patient’s body.
In the group’s experiments,
rats were infected with E.coli and
Staphylococcus aureus. After the
blood cleansing treatment, more
than 90% of the bacteria had been
removed. Furthermore, bacterial
infiltration to the organs was also
significantly reduced. The team has
postulated that patient survival rates
may improve in the event of a septic
shock after a treatment of only 5
hours.
So far the biospleen has only been
tested in animal models and in vitro
samples of human blood. So what can
we expect from the device in a clinical
scenario?
The scientists are clearly optimistic.
In human blood models, the team

Indira Mallik on how to clean blood using magnets
as multiple infections, and found
the removal rates were consistently
above 90% after a single pass through
the device. Sepsis develops so rapidly
and is so devastating because of the
huge pathogen loads involved. The
biospleen acts to reduce that.
Some patients may balk at the idea
of being hooked up to a machine
for 5 hours but currently there is no
specific drug treatment since Xigris,
the only targeted drug developed for
sepsis, was taken off the market in
2011.
With further development, the
biospleen could well provide a more
effective treatment in the future.
We are entering an era in medical
science where antibiotic use,
especially that of broad spectrum
antibiotics is to be cautioned against
because of a rise in antibiotic
resistance. Broad spectrum
antibiotics also have the nasty habit
of producing severe side effects in
already very unwell individuals.
Many sepsis patients could
benefit from such a device but it
could prove life saving for those
especially at risk those suffering
from antibiotic-resistant infection,
the immunosuppressed such as
transplant patients, and babies
suffering from fungal infections.
Most importantly, from the patient’s
perspective, the treatment is quick
and relieves the patient from staying
in intensive care units for days and
suffering long term organ damage
that may lead to dependence on
dialysis machines.
The biospleen may take some time
to become available to the general
public as in vivo trials still need to
carried out. But one thing is certain:
the chance of treatment won’t be
a day too soon for the millions of
patients that contract sepsis each
year.
