This week, you are Hangman.
After managing to sneak in a
horoscope about your Editor’s
nocturnal activities into last
weeks issue, you are forced to
grovel to her as an apology.
Before you know it you are the
2nd person to get with her in as
manyweeks.

This week, you realise that
London is more dangerous than
your native Bath. In an attempt
to avoid getting mugged, you
sign up for Ju-Jitsu, Judo, Karate,
Kendo,KungFu,MuayThai,and
WingChun,allofwhichturnout
tobeuselesswhenyouinevitably
pass out drunk on the N23 and
some joker slips your phone out
ofyourpocket.Twat.
This week, you are the UCL
Provost. Your main activity
these days is trying to find an
explanation for the ‘bello’ email
you sent to all 26,000 of your
students whilst off your face on
speedballs.Intheend,youdecide
to blame it on ‘hackers’. Hm.
Thatwaseasy.Pint?
This week, you decide to write
a ghost post on behalf of the
Welfare sabb. You have a
sarcasticdigatthestudentpaper,
who in turn, lose their shit. They
will never forget that event you
ran that lost £3,000 and will
refer to it whenever they are
nearing the deadline and want
to take their stress out on people
thataren’tcopyeditors.
This week you come home from
the Union depressed from being
rejected by yet another girl. You
cuddle up with Mr Flopsy, but
during the night you have a
little accident. You, the bed and
Mr Flopsy are soaked. Poor Mr
Flopsy.
This week, you go to the CGCU
Welcome Dinner. You have a
great time with your friends,
even if you were the only girl
there. Still, you drink, eat and
even pull. Well done you. You
however, don’t want to be shown
up by your RCSU hallmate who
apparently had more fun at the
ball,soyougetpregnanttoo.
This week, guess what? You’re
still the DPW. You are now so
sick of your overpaid job that
you are trying to get fired by
any means necessary. You slip
in as many offensive phrases
into as many pointless meetings
as possible. It doesn’t work. You
end up drowning your sorrows
in568,again.
This week, you develop yellow
fever. Actually, who are we
kidding - you’ve had it since
Lower Sixth. Anyway, you grab
your Mandarin phrasebook and
decidetotryyourluckatthenext
ABACUS event. Lamentably,
you get all the tones wrong and
inadvertentlycallthePresident’s
motherawhore.bùhǎo.
This week, you are an Engineer.
Whilst on the pull, you realise
that the condom in your wallet
has expired. Fortunately,
your friends remind you that
you won’t need a condom,
your personality will keep
all the potential mates away.
#foreveralone
This week, you go hard the night
before graduation. You wake up
in the morning feeling rather
rough.Youputyourgownonand
headofftotheRoyalAlbertHall.
While waiting for your name to
be called out, your feel the vomit
crawling its way up your throat.
You panic, open your purse
and release the chunder into it,
repeatedly.
This week, you take the roomate
battle to a new level. While he’s
out, you go into the bathroom
and take his toothbrush. You
then slowly insert it into your
arsehole and proceed to give it
a pleasurable scrub. You put it
back. He’s called shit breath all
week. You’ve never felt so clean
andminty downstairs. #fresh
This week, you go to the RCSU
Ball. You have a great time, well
done RCSU. The only down side
was waking up next to someone
you don’t recognise. You check
he’s still asleep, grab your
trousers and head home. 3 weeks
later you get the news you’re a
mother. Congrats on having an
RCSUbaby!
