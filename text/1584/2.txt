What’s on this week:
Elections
Voting opens at noon on
monday 20th and closes
Friday 24th at noon.
Results will be
announced online on
the 24th
This week, Felix has been investi-
gating the changes to the Amenities
Fund for Halls. These funds, used to
cover the costs of events put on in
Halls, have been reduced in size. The
fallout has been particularly notice-
able during the past two weeks.
We’ve spoke to a lot of Hall Seniors,
Sub Wardens, Wardens and Fresh-
ers themselves to see their side of the
story. We have also been in contact
with the College to hear their reason-
ing behind the changes too. It seems
that College, for the most part, are
well meaning, or at least, this is how
they have come across to Felix in
emails and telephone calls.
However, facts and figures don’t lie.
We’ve taken the funds allocated per
Hall this year, and then compared
them to last year, and the change
seems startling. Although the Col-
lege reasons that these cuts are to
put money back into the pockets of
new students, we have yet to receive
figures that confirms this. Some pre-
liminary models have suggested that
this may be the case, but at the time of
print, we have heard nothing to back
this up despite several emails asking
for the figures to be sent to us.
It comes down to transparency
again, a buzzword thrown around
by staff, students and sabbaticals
alike. This new move, to transfer
the financial responsibility to Hall
Committees and let the students see
how their money is being controlled,
is fantastic. The sad part of the story
is that Halls have been given only half
(or even less) of the money they have
had in previous years, and the knock
on effect this has had during this fort-
night has been particularly tangible.
Felix has tried to put both sides of
this story across; we’ve published a
statement from Debra Humphris, the
Vice Provost of Education who was
on the Residence Experience Review
panel and a driving force behind
the change. We also gathered many
different quotes from those who have
been affected by the change in funds.
For the most part, it seems like a lot
of the issues have stemmed from an
issue in communication between the
College and students, and hopefully
our coverage can clear up some of
the misconceptions surrounding the
whole issue.
We’ve also covered the first non-
alcoholic event of the year that the
Union have organised, known as
Dri. We had sabbaticals and college
staff alike visiting the office to “have
a look” at the article, and then, mo-
ments before we are to go to print, the
Union released a blog post on their
website about the event, in an appar-
ent attempt to “beat us to it.”
The blog, allegedly written by Chris
Kaye, Deputy President (Welfare),
stated that “Whilst the Union ran, or-
ganised and delivered tens of events
in the last two weeks that have almost
entirely been a sell-out, beaten budget
and been received well by our mem-
bers, our fine newspaper has decided
to report on this event only.”
We chose to report on this event
because it was the only event that was
actually newsworthy. The Union runs
Freshers’ events every year, and every
year they are a success. Every year
freshers’ turn up, buy alcohol, social-
ise, and then leave. This year was no
different. The Dri night was the first
time the Union tried something new,
and credit to them, but we are here to
hold them to account as much as to
herald their praises, which I think our
rather semi-serious, tongue-in-cheek
article manages to do.
As the union showed on Thursday
evening, they have their own chan-
nels to communicate to students
outside of Felix, and we would suggest
that if they want to use us that they
send us pictures and articles in time
for the deadline.

FELIX EDITOR
SKETT’S BOX OF SHAME
Apologies for the many mistakes in
issue 1583. These were:
- Putting “DPCS” instead of “DPFS”
next to the photo of Alex Savell on
the front page
- Citing XUAN CHEN as author on
the “Ebola Update...” article in World
News, page 7. This was written by
CECILE BORKHATARIA
- All of the grammar and spelling
mistakes in my own editorial
- Spelling my own name wrong at
one point. So shameful.
- Calling it the Ruby club, not the
Rugby club in “LSE disbands Rugby
Club’ article on page 6
- Sometimes apostrophes were
printed as boxes. We have no idea
why this happens still.
