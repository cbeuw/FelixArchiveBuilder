Mental health
helplines
and resources
Even if we’ve overcome the
stigma against mental illnesses,
let’s admit it, they are still
scary. Especially if you have friends
who are suffering from them.
One moment, they’re great and fun
to hang around, but then one day, it
feels like they’ve been snatched and
replaced by a doppelganger that is
moody, sulky or irritable, depending
on the mental disorder.
Now what do you do? You probably
want to help, but how? To most
people, they’d probably just pitch in a
considerate, “Don’t worry, everything
will be all right!” before slowly
backing away.
Unfortunately, despite the best
intentions, that is not very helpful.
It’s like saying ‘Don’t worry, it’ll stop
hurting soon,’ to someone with a cut
on their arm.
Remember that even if we can deal
with the blues every now and then,
this is not the same for people who
sometimes cannot control what they
feel.
So that’s why I decided to write this
article to help the good-intentioned
help their friends when they need it
most.
In all the peer support training I’ve
been to, we learn that the best way to
help is to listen and understand what
they feel. It’s not a matter of trying
to solve problems because sometimes
they can feel too big to be solved
or they might not know what the
problem is. So to listen and letting
them know that you’re there to listen
is already a huge relief.
There remains a daunting task of
how to talk, or even approach, friends
going through a phase however. So
here are some tips I’ve gathered from
my peer support training, hoping
that they will be useful to some kind
souls out there.
Try not to judge
Emphasis on try. We’re human
beings after all and we often judge
things surrounding us. But when
your friend is going through a phase,
actively judging them for what they
are then, rather than what they
generally are, can really make things
worse. It’s already bad enough to
involuntarily go through phases or
think in ways that disrupts their daily
life.
Instead, try to make them feel that
you want to understand them for
what they are without judging them.
By doing this, you will make them
more open to you and therefore
more willing to accept your help.
Otherwise, they will just shut you off,
thinking that you will hurt them with
your judgements.
Ask open questions
When your friend is going through
a tough time in his or her head
and you ask questions that can be
answered with a ‘yes’ or ‘no’, you’ll
most likely get just that, leaving you
hanging in awkward silence. Being
conversational and following the
rules of social etiquette won’t be high
on their list of priorities so you’ll
often have to allow room for them
to talk by asking broad questions.
An example would be “You didn’t
seem to enjoy yourself at the dinner.
What’s wrong?”
Also these questions will help
your friend articulate their jumbled
thoughts, which you can help
organise by asking more questions.
But at the same time, avoid
'why' questions
This one sounds silly, but a scenario
would demonstrate this best. Say,
you’re having a bad day. Your
favourite football team fell out of the
league, your group meeting ended up
in a shouting contest and you’ve just
lost five games of Starcraft in a row.
Then your flatmate came in, noticed
your gloomy expression and asked,
“Why so gloomy, man?” When you
answered, he decided to play detective
with another question, “Why do you
even let them bother you?”
Questions starting with ‘why’
always have a judgement attached to
them.
“Why don’t you eat that?” “ Why do
you hate her so much?” “Why are you
always so sensitive?”
When faced with questions that
imply that they’re not normal or
accepted, people with disorders
would tend to withdraw from the
conversation since they feel that they
won’t be understood.
So what do we ask? Instead of using
‘why’, try rephrasing the question in
a different way that still show that
you want to understand how they
feel. For example, instead of “Why do
you hate her so much?’, say ‘What is
it that you don’t like about her?’. In
the same way, ‘Why are you always
so sensitive?’ can be phrased as ‘What
makes you feel this way?’
Summarise things for them
Trust me, there is nothing more
reassuring for someone who often
feels isolated by their condition than
to be given an accurate summary of
what they are feeling. It’s the best way
to show your friend that you truly
understand them and hearing an echo
of the feelings they’ve articulated is
an amazing relief.
Some people might be reluctant to
summarise because they are scared
they will get it wrong and make
things worse. But that’s not true. If
you are mistaken about anything,
you will likely be corrected and end
up with up with a more complete
understanding of your friend’s
situation.
Everyone is different
A tip you hear all the time, but
worth mentioning. When someone
who is suffering from depression
or anxiety said they want to be left
alone, it can either mean they want
to be avoided until the phase blows
over or it can equally be a subtle cry
for help. This differs from person to
person, condition to condition, so do
adjust to what your friends are like.
Try to find out what they truly want
with open questions about how they
feel and also show that you are willing
to talk. But bear in mind that if all
your efforts are brushed away, it’s not
your fault. They might just prefer to
be left alone.
To sum up, I want to point out
that I’m aware I used the word
‘phases’ a lot throughout this
article. And that’s to make it very
clear that a mental illness is not what
defines the person suffering from
it. It’s a state, it’s an interference, a
disruption to daily life. So please bear
with people who go through it from
time to time. They will be incredibly
grateful for your efforts amidst
the world full of stigma on mental
illnesses. And I hope that you will
find some tips here useful!
Oh and of course, these tips can also
useful and can be applied to anyone!

68,044 Pledge to end the stigma of mental illness
October is a month marked by
prominent health awareness
campaigns from Breast
Cancer Awareness to Stoptober.
However, October is also marked
by a less prominent but equally
important campaign to raise
awareness for mental health.
Mental illness affects one in four
people nevertheless those who suffer
face stigma and discrimination.
Many people have negative and
preconceived beliefs about mental
illness. There is a sense of judgement
and shame for those who suffer.
The NHS fails to offer treatments
that meet standards set for physical
illness leaving many people alone in
times of crisis, with the introduction
of maximum wait times, next
spring, occurring long after those for
physical illness.
Multiple organisations and
charities are working tirelessly to
change attitudes toward mental
illness including Time to Change.
Time to Change is an organisation
lead by charities Mind and Rethink
Mental Illness that aims to educate
the public about mental health and
encourage open discussion, most
notably through the #TimeToTalk
and Pledge Wall campaigns.
To date, 68,044 people have signed
the Time To Change pledge wall to
tackle the stigma of mental illness.
1,526 of whom signed last Friday
on World Mental Health Day
exemplifying the success of the day.
To sign the pledge wall visit www.
time-to-change.org.uk. Every pledge
is a step toward ending stigma.
"The NHS
