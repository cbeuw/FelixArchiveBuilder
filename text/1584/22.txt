We’ll be doing an article
in another edition on
some of the architectural
highlights of London but for
now, here are a few places hosting
exhibitions on the subject at the
moment
•The Royal Institute of British
Architects (RIBA) on Portland
Place regularly hosts exhibitions and
talks on architecture and also has a
wonderful library filled with every
imaginable book on the subject.
•The Barbican is not only a must-
see as a piece of architecture in its
own right but often hosts fantastic
exhibitions such as Constructing
The Hunterian Museum in the
Royal College of Surgeons is one
such place. Founded by John Hunter,
it hosts his personal collection of
biological samples which were used to
Here are a number of museums
that don’t comfortably fit in
any of the previous categories
but are definitely worth knowing
about

a good place to watch as they regularly
host lectures and exhibitions that are
open to the public.
For something slightly different,
visit the Sir John Soane's Museum
on Lincoln’s Inn Fields, an absolute
treasure in the heart of London. Free
to enter, this little-known museum
was the house of architect Sir John
Soane and is chock-full of sculptures,
paintings and architectural curios,
winding through a building
ingeniously designed by Soane
himself. Moreover, on the first
Tuesday of every month they also
have a candlelit evening opening, a
favourite art experience in London –
not to mention a great date idea!
It is extremely rare for a city to
have more than one venue that
hosts opera but London is one of
those fortunate cities, hosting both
the world-class Royal Opera House
(ROH) and the English National
Opera (ENO) at the Coliseum.
The ROH is London’s main opera
establishment, renowned for the
quality of its output and certainly
up there with the likes of the Met
in New York and La Scala in Milan.
However despite this, it is still able
to maintain a very down to earth
attitude and although people tend
to dress up for the occasion, there is
no pressure to do so. You can also get
some pretty reasonably priced seats,
even for your student budget!
A key event on the agenda for
this season at the ROH is their new
production of Mozart’s Idomeneo,
which tells the tale of Idomeneo, a

museum full of biological oddities
but it also contains a large collection
of animal specimens.
Alternatively, you could head to the
Grant Museum of Zoology at UCL,
which houses thousands of specimens
of particular interest to biology
students.
The Marianne North Gallery
houses an astonishing collection of
botanical paintings and illustrations
by Victorian biologist Marianne
North.
war hero who inadvertently promises
to sacrifice his own son. Rich in
drama and emotion, this will be the
UK debut of Austrian director Martin
Kusej. (3rd-24th Nov)
The ENO is somewhat more
accessible to the general public
as the majority of operas are
sung in English, making it a good
introduction into an art form that
can sometimes seem rather daunting
to an outsider. Although it can
occasionally feel a bit too ‘West End’,
they also do put on some excellent
new pieces that are slightly more
experimental. Moreover, their ‘secret
seat’ system, where you pay £20 and
are allocated a seat worth £25 and
above, makes it extremely affordable
and could mean that you even get a
seat down in the stalls!
A sure highlight for this season will
be Fiona Shaw’s production of The
Marriage of Figaro, a comic opera of
intrigue, drama and sexual tension.
Some performances will be preceded
by a talk by librettist Jeremy Sams
and production manager Sheelagh
Barnard. (16th Oct – 23rd Nov)
There are also some smaller opera
productions dotted around, most
notably the Fulham Opera, based
down by Fulham Broadway, which
is very convenient for Imperial
students!
Sadler's Wells Theatre in
Finsbury, and The Coliseum and
Royal Opera House in Covent
Garden are the city’s major venues
for ballet, hosting the English
National Ballet and the occasional
visiting ballet troupes from abroad.
So whether you want a bit of Swan
Lake or maybe something a bit
more avant-garde, there’s always
something to see.
