The Legend of Korra is a rare
breed – a sequel show to Avatar:
The Last Airbender (broadcast in
the UK as Avatar: The Legend of Aang
because ‘bender’ means something
else over here). Avatar is my favourite
show of all time, so I could easily
spend the next 1000 words gushing
over how amazing it is. Instead, let’s
talk a bit about Korra, whose final
season is airing right now.
But first, context Avatar was an
animated show that ran for three
seasons on Nickelodeon from 2005-
2008. During its run it gained a small
but dedicated fan following, my
teenage self among them (good times).
After its run the original fandom
remained, but grew in number thanks
to word of mouth, Tumblr, streaming
on Netflix etc. There may have been a
movie at some point. Let’s move on.
Korra is set 70 years after the events
of the first show. It features all new
characters, a new setting and a new
villain, whilst retaining the art style
– with improved animation quality
– continuity and world building. In
particular the main character, Korra,
was written and designed to be the
exact opposite of the previous main
character, Aang.
Whereas Aang was peace-loving,
spiritual and carefree, Korra
is boisterous, aggressive, and
headstrong. Where Avatar flew its
characters to various places inspired
by ancient Asian architecture
(Chinese, Korean, Tibetan, Japanese
and more), Korra initially takes
place in one city inspired by a blend
of 1920s Hong Kong, Shanghai and
Manhattan.
Most importantly though, whereas
each season of Avatar (called a
‘book’) lasted 20 episodes and had a
somewhat loose structure with plenty
of room for ‘filler’ episodes (allowing
for more character moments, world
building and thematic stuff), Korra’s
seasons look more like a mini-series
each, with around 13 tightly-written,
highly structured episodes flowing
almost continuously. This led to a
much larger focus on plot and various
narrative twists and turns. The whole
thing seems to be an exercise in
making your sequel as different to the
original as possible.
It’s fair to say that Korra’s first
‘book’, which came out in 2012, was
very successful; people liked the new
direction in which the creators were
taking their world. The fight scenes –
a high point of Avatar – were elevated
to indescribable levels of awesome
and the new setting simply looked
really cool.
There were, however, inevitably
going to be criticisms. There was
less time for character development
(necessitated by the small number
of episodes, of course). There
was an annoying subplot about a
love triangle (or would that be a
quadrangle?), and some people found
the characters annoying.
Many people also thought the
ending was rushed, and resolved all
of the loose ends too neatly. This was
probably because the creators didn’t
expect the show to be renewed and
felt they had to wrap it all up.
Overall, was it a ‘worthy successor’
to Avatar? Most thought so, to a
degree. Was it as good? Most thought
not. But how could it be? How could
they make a near-perfect show twice
in a row when they took so many risks
and changed so much?
Thankfully, the show did get
renewed. Amazingly, Nickelodeon
ordered three more seasons at once
– 40 more episodes in total (for
reference, each episode is estimated
to cost about a million dollars to
produce). Suddenly, the creators
had to create three new stories from
scratch after perfectly resolving it
all at the end of the first Korra story.
And that’s where things started to go
wrong.
Whilst I wouldn’t go as far as calling
Book Two of Korra, which came out in
2013, ‘bad’, by the exceedingly high
standards set by Avatar (and indeed by
Korra’s previous season) it certainly
wasn’t very impressive. In any other
context it would be dismissed as a
generic Saturday morning cartoon,
really. The plot was all over the place,
the villain was very one-dimensional,
his evil scheme was confusing,
and the characters seemed to have
regressed and forgotten all of their
previous character development.
The animation quality was also
reduced, since the studio which
worked on all of the previous episodes
of the franchise couldn’t do it at such
short notice. Save for two exceedingly
good episodes which told an ‘origin
story’ for a lot of the show’s lore
and myths, a lot of fans were very
disappointed with it all.
Thankfully, there’s almost a happy
ending here. This summer, Book
Three was released online. Not only
was it a massive improvement on
Book Two, many fans seem to think
that Book Three represents the first
time Korra has been as good as Avatar.
A new team of villains were
introduced who were menacing,
badass and yet somehow still quite
human. This new team pushed our
heroes to their limit, and seeing the
protagonists struggle to face them was
an immensely satisfying experience.
There was no annoying romance
subplot like in the previous
two seasons and the characters
remembered their character
development whilst staying true to
what makes them unique, plus the
animation and action scenes were
easily some of the best the entire
franchise has seen.
It was also pleasing to see that not
everything was neatly resolved at the
end and, in a great finale, the last shot
makes it clear that things are open
ended, and there’s still a lot of loose
plot threads. In short, Book Three is
where the show finally lived up to its
name and became legendary.
What’s next for Korra? In a surprise
move a month ago, the creators
announced that the final book would
begin on the 3rd of October, so it’s
out now! That does, sadly, mean that
Korra, and probably the whole Avatar
franchise, will be ending this year.
After the drama it took to get Korra
released I doubt that Nickelodeon will
go for a third show in this franchise
– though in-universe comics will
probably continue to be published.
This time next year both shows will
probably be on Netflix, so one will be
able to watch all 113 episodes back-
to-back. In some ways I envy those
people, not having to go through the
drama and the waiting. Then again,
it’s been a pleasure to experience it
piece by piece as part of a wonderful
fandom. But I haven’t lost hope. I still
believe that somehow a new Avatar
show will come to save the franchise.
