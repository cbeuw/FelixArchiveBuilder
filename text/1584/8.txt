Heston opens as the new home of sport
OLIVER BENTON
NEWS REPORTER
Heston, the new home of
Medic sport, was unveiled
on Wednesday the 15th of
October, to a nibbles and ‘BUCS’ fizz
reception. Debra Humphris, Vice
Provost (Education), launched the
day with a short speech commenting
on the “continued evolution of our
sports facilities” and the revealing of
a plaque honouring Teddington and
a piece of the hallowed Teddington
grass.
The planes are as close as at
Harlington, indicating quite how far
West the new sports ground is.
However, it took only 30 minutes
by minibus to reach the new centre,
a large sprawling complex that backs
onto the swathe of sports grounds.
Alex Savell, Deputy President
(Finance and Services), has already
scoped the ground and thinks at least
two polo pitches could fit on the site,
such is the expanse.
Teddington was also honoured by
the renaming of one of the bars (there
were three open and operational
on Wednesday) as the Teddington
Bar. The lack of Medic trophies and
memorabilia from the last 130 years
of Medic sport is unlikely to change
in the near future an ICMSU source
said they were keen to consolidate
most of their memorabilia in The
Reynolds Bar, (the home of ICSMU
bar within Charing Cross Hospital) to
ease the loss of Teddington.
The small piece of turf lifted from
Teddington did stand out, initially
because it was on a plaque, and
secondly because the surrounding
grass is in excellent condition.
While much has been made about
the complete disregard for student
input, the groundskeeper at Heston
obviously knows his stuff; the pitches
are, in the words of an anonymous
Medic Footballer, “excellent”.
Not only was the grass in excellent
nick and the pitches reasonably flat,
there was the correct adornment of
Phoenix flags, much to the medics’
delight.
The sports facilities were in full
use all afternoon, with all pitches (6
football and 2 rugby), all the netball
and all the tennis courts being used
during a damp and overcast day
in West London. Even the Medics
President, Dariush Hassanzadeh-
Baboli, managed to dig out a rugby
shirt for a cameo seconds appearance,
claiming he might even play at
Varsity.
IC Cheerleaders were also in
attendance as were representatives
from ICU Dance who gave
demonstrations to College and Union
staff.
The day was rounded off by
a compelling speech from Tom
Wheeler, Union President, and Abi
de Bruin, Deputy President (Clubs
and Societies), extolling the virtues of
the new sports ground.
Tom Wheeler said, “It was fantastic
to see sports teams using the new
facilities at Hestion and performance
teams using the new space in the
theatre that is also on the site.
“It is important we don’t forget the
history and tradition of Teddington
and the siginificance of it’s loss. We
are looking forward to celebrating
Teddington this weekend at the
Teddington Alumnus Day, as are
excited for the future of sport at
Heston.”
“The future of College bursaries in your hands”
TOM WHEELER
UNION PRESIDENT
Iagree this is weird, what is
someone from the Union doing
writing an article in Felix about
a College decision? But please keep
reading because this really matters.
If you are a Home Undergraduate
student and receive an Imperial
College Bursary (i.e.: your household’s
income is <£60k), then I really want
to know what you think of the
bursary support package that College
provides. Remember, that this is
only talking about the bursary that
College provides, and not the Student
Finance one.
As a disclaimer, I’d like to reiterate
that unfortunately for the majority
of students who might be reading
this, that this precise discussion
only affects Home Undergraduate
students with a household income of
<£60k. Also, please don’t think that
we don’t know that there are serious
financial support issues affecting
a large number of the rest of our
members; however, this funding
package is only targeted at Home
Undergraduate students. Remember
that if you are ever in need of help
and advice then you should ask the
Union’s Advice Centre to find out if
there is money available to help you.
I sit on a working group in College
that focuses on ensuring that
everyone who is capable to study
at Imperial, can. Imperial College
provides a bursary package that is
quite a bit bigger than pretty much
every other University that I have
managed to look into. It should, as
South Kensington is (unsurprisingly)
really expensive, but how expensive?
Imperial College is proposing
changes to the distribution of the
amount given in bursaries for the
2016/17 first years so that every
student who is offered a place to study
at Imperial can afford it. They are
not looking at reducing the amount it
spends on bursaries, but distributing
it as fairly as possible. The most
challenging thing that I’m trying
to figure out when looking through
some of the options proposed is what
is fair? Here are some (exaggerated,
and generally rhetorical) questions
to show you what I’m getting at (and
by the way, I don’t have an opinion/
answer to these).
How much money does a student
need? Is it fair to assume that
students from a £40k household
are financially supported by their
families? Is it fair to assume that the
number of dependents in a household
is irrelevant when distributing
student funding? Is it fair that
students from a £24k household
receive nearly twice as much as a
£40k household? Does every £40k
household have the £2k a year to
bring a student up to a ‘living wage’?
You get the idea.
College has proposed some
options ranging from “keep the same
model” through to “give everyone
the same amount”. I have had a lot
of conversations and meetings in
the last 5 days with the Sabb team,
as well as staff and students in the
Union about the different options
that College has proposed, however
nothing is as representative of what
students want as an actual discussion
with students. Therefore, I’m inviting
you all to come and find out what
options are proposed, ask questions,
and give your opinion. We are
holding a meeting in Blackett Lecture
Theatre 1, this Thursday at 1pm. If
you want to get in touch, please email
me at union.president@ic.ac.uk.
