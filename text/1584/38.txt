Fifteen excited tourists arrive
in the union. There’s not
only drizzle in the air but
also anticipation, so much so that a
certain kitchen utensil could be used
to cut it. No one knew what to expect.
Ciro, the tour organiser, is renowned
for his general lack of intelligence
and exuberant fresher handling
techniques. Both are qualities that
could have sent the tour either
way. If only there was someone to
micro-manage him... Having failed
to find such a person, Henry Legge
commenced stash dispensation. The
kit was beautiful. I could hear people
saying expletives such as “gosh” and
“crikey”. With Henry having won
everyone over with his sterling effort
on the kit and witty comments we
headed to Heathrow.
Once on the plane operation G&T
took full effect. With the better
looking members of the group using
good looks and bilingualism to win
over the male airhostess we, as a
team, single handily raised the price
of Bombay Saphire stock by 12%
(credit Dave Jones for that stat).
Before we knew it we were at the
hostel and in need of Pesos. All
equipped with as many dollars as
we could afford we headed to a well
known currency district to exchange,
an event that changed our lives
forever. Having arrived in Argentina
merely as members of both the lower
and middle classes of the West we
were not ready for the pressures
that came with being a billionaire.
Billionaire, I kid you not. Having
googled what to do when you win the
lottery we went to our first restaurant
and ordered copious amounts of
meat and red wine in an attempt to
spend our money. The booze and beef
arrived, however the bill never did. It,
like everything else, was free.
The first game came round like
Shuz in a drive through. Fast. We
were now down to only 14 players
due to Dave “Wisdom” Jones’ failed
attempt at going down a step unaided.
The hosts very hospitably gifted
us a player for both halves, one of
which was called Nacho. When we
were initially confronted with this
unfamiliar and frankly complicated
name our Spanish speaker Ciro
thankfully stepped in and told us to
call him Nathan.
The remaining members of the tour
flew in on the 6th day to bring our
numbers up to the dizzying heights of
18. Keen to get straight into the flow
of things they hit the bar, resulting
in the destruction of a hairdresser’s
toilet, the taking of a shower in some
sewage and huge amounts of foliage
destruction in conjunction with the
shouting of “Wales” and “weakness”.
We were so glad they had settled in
so well.
Game two saw us lose,
unfortunately. Upset and hungry
we went to the post game nosh to be
greeted by “pizza”. The “pizza” was
great. Really great. Refilled they
took us to a bar where the measure
25ml was replaced with 250ml, the
result of which was large amounts of
wammoednessness (A phenomenon
whereby an individual loses control
of limbs, can speak Spanish and fly.

Thanks Dave.)
With that our stay in the capital
was over and we set off for Rosario.
The mode of transport was a semi-
calma coach, which in Layman’s
terms is a massive metal box of
comfort. Refreshed and ready we
arrived in the city of Rosario. It
seemed nice and all that we had met
prior had said how gorgeous the
girls were, and they weren’t wrong.
They were so gorgeous Matt Harvey
changed religion, had a circumcision
and attempted to marry one of the
locals.
After really hitting it off with the
manager of the wipe clean plastic
surface that was our hostel he decided
to ask him to come with him on a
night out. The following morning
Chris limped to the bathroom as he
went to wash his mouth out. The
details of what happened to him are
unclear, but we know it involved 5
men, a red pill and a very high pain
threshold.
Cordoba. The first night saw us
pay a seemingly disproportionate
price for a bar crawl. After a few days
of consuming unrealistic amounts
