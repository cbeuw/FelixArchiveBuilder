As well as the established art venues,
London has a long tradition of private
galleries,where the pieces you see
will generally be on sale.Often they
will have multiple artists on their
roster,but stage exhibitions of a
single artist to drum up publicity for
their work,generating greater prices.
These galleries allow you to visit
and see artwork for free.Now,these
galleries may seem like hostile,
unwelcoming places,but it's
important to remember that their
raisond'etre is to attract people in to
buy their work,so don't be afraid to
go in and have a look around.Strike
up a conversation with the gallery
assistants–they are there to answer
your questions,and usually have a
wealth of knowledge about the artist
on display,their working methods,
and any similar artists that you might
enjoy.
West London: Mayfair &
Fitzrovia
In West London,the main bulk
of galleries can be found in the
labyrinthine complex of streets
between Piccadilly and Euston Road.
This area has been known historically
for its artistic tendencies,and it is
here that you will find some of the
most well established commercial
art galleries,such as the White Cube
Gallery (25-26 Masons Yard),which
was one of the first places to put on
solo exhibitions of the YBAs.
East London: Whitechapel,
Hoxton,& Shoreditch
Although the stretch of London
between Aldgate East station and
Kingsland Road may seem like a
modern-day inferno full of braying
twats who work in media,the
area has a strong presence in the
contemporary art scene.There are
some real gems,such as Maureen
Paley (21 Herald Street),whose
clients include Wolfgang Tillmans
and Gillian Wearing,both Turner
Prize winners.
South London: Peckham,South-
wark,and Camberwell
Once East London reached‘peak
hipness’,it was only a matter of time
before a motley crew of artists and
students roamed London looking for
the cheapest property prices.Low
rents,proximity to art schools such as
Camberwell,and new transport links
provided by London Overground
make the South the new spawning
ground for art galleries.However,
not all are new openings; some have
been here for a while,such as Studio
Voltaire (1a Nelson's Row),an artist
collective which this year celebrates
its 20th
anniversary.
