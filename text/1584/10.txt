What does £220,000 a year
get you? It’s more than the
combined rent of the 22
new beds in Beit Hall over a calendar
year, two-thirds of the former rector’s
salary of £364,000 (Times High
Education Supplement) and 0.22%of
Imperial College London’s £97
million endowment.
£220,000 is also how much has left
the amenities fund for halls events
and activities this year.
Most of us went through the
Freshers’ halls experience, but that’s
now changing. Hall seniors and
wardens are best placed to provide
pastoral care to first years and budget
cuts are making it harder for them to
do this.
For example, many residences’ hall
senior training allegedly could not
given any budget this year. Fewer
events are reducing the time spent
between seniors and freshers, making
it harder to encourage integration.
Motivating hall seniors to organise
events is also harder; organising a
film night isn’t quite the same as a
boat party.
£220,000 is fully affordable for
college. What is a small amount
to them makes a huge difference
for the hall seniors and wardens.
It helps them to do their job and
make Imperial welcoming and a
enjoyable place. London can be seen
as an unfriendly city for many - hall
seniors do a fantastic job of stopping
this and supporting us all when we
begin our Imperial careers.
They are the unsung heros of the
Imperial student experience and they
should be encouraged to do more and
continue their fantastic work.
Yet another nail in the coﬃn of the student experience
There could be a reduced number of events in the social spaces.
