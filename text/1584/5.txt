“It has become
increasingly
apparent to
me throughout
the three years
I’ve spent as
a subwarden
that the
College could
not care
less about
students.”
“College
doesn’t
know what is
going on in
the halls...”
“College’s
attempt to
improve
the student
experience has
not been well
received.”
“It’s the
freshers
that are
missing
out...”
s, but where has the difference gone?
In 2013 College set up a review of the
residential experience, that involved
a Independent panel of staff and also
included David Goldsmith, the Union
President of the time, and Marissa
Lewis, the Deputy President (Welfare).
This was to look at the issues around
the residential experience, including
evaluating the amenities funds.
Before this year, amenities funding
was different for different halls, based
on historical decisions and the basis
these differences has been somewhat
lost. As part of the Residential Experi-
ence the panel were keen to make the
way the funding worked more transpar-
ent. The fund should be uniform per
student, so students know how much
they spend and what it is spent on for
hall activities.
The move of amenities funds from col-
lege to the union is rather positive: hall
committees now control the money and
the funds, with the support of the Hall
Warden. Whilst the funds are collected
by the College, they are transferred
straight into a pot that the union then
distributes across halls. Students are
involved in the decision making when
spending the money.
The motivation was to leave money
in students’ pockets, and we are al-
ways mindful of students who have a
household with an income of less than
£20,000 and for whom coming to a
university in the most expensive area of
the country is a challenge.
The panel originally decided that
a flat figure of £1.00 per student per
week would be acceptable, but Marissa
Lewis and David Goldsmith said around
£1.50 would be better. Given that the
accommodation costs had already been
published, the Provost’s Board accepted
this change and agreed that the funds to
make up the difference, £42,500 would
be found from the Education Office as a
one off.
There will now be a review in January
each year involving students, the Union
and the College to define what the fund
should be the following year.
Hall committees now have full control
of the money and they need to ensure
that they use the money for events that
appeal to as many residents as possible.
Working with the wardens the Hall
Committees manage their funds across
the year. Given that much of the fund is
used on the Welcome Week, it would be
really helpful if hall committees could
help shape the welcome for the next
intake. Using the Union’s online services
to manage the fund, this provides greater
transparency, which has been received
positively.
Another outcome of the review was the
encouragement of greater transparency
about rents and work on this is being
taken forward by the Chief Financial Of-
ficer and Vice Provost (Education). Rent
increases year on year are influenced by
inflation and costs including bills for
energy, cleaning, depreciation.
Before now, there was no student input
in the rent costs, we want to change this.
Professor Debra Humphris, Vice Provost (Education)
“Hall seniors
were only
told about
the cuts
two weeks
before...”
Debra Humphris, the Vice Provost (Education) has overall responsibility for educational strategy and the
quality of the educational provision and across the College. She presented recommendations for changes as
a result of the Residential Experience Review, which resulted in the inital proposal to assign £1 per student
per week. Professor Humphris spoke to Felix about the changes in the amenities fund:
