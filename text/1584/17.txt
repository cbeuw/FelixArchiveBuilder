Hello, and welcome to our Artist’s Guide to London, where we will be detailing all the best
culture the capital has in store for you. We understand that it can be daunting to try and
explore the innumerable venues for art, dance, theatre and opera, but we are here to provide
you with a helping hand so that you can get the most out of your time here!
Fine Arts
Victoria & Albert Museum
Located right on our doorstep, this
is one of the best places in London
to wander around during a lazy
afternoon away from lectures.
Founded in 1852, and home to more
than 4.5 million objects ranging from
sculpture to fine china, it is the largest
museum of design in the world. To
make it even better, Imperial students,
on presentation of their student card,
get discounted entry into the special
exhibitions!

Barbican Centre
Made up of two galleries, two
theatres, a concert hall, three
restaurants, three cinemas, a library
and a conservatory, the Barbican
is a labyrinthine arts centre – the
largest of its kind in Europe – that
makes other venues seem quaint in
comparison. Opened in 1982 and
designed by Chamberlin, Powell and
Bon, it is a masterpiece of brutalist
architecture, feted and loathed in
equal measure. Outside the centre,
a complex of fountains and gardens
makes this one of the best places in
London for a stroll.

•Constructing Worlds: Photography
and Architecture in the Modern Age
– An examination of buildings
on film, bringing together 18
photographers who have changed the
way we view architecture in the 20th
and 21st
centuries (until 11th
Jan).
•The regular themed seasons that
the Barbican runs comprising of
workshops, talks and films, these
provide a wealth of opportunities to
learn about different topics.
Tate Britain and Modern
Tate Britain is located on the
north bank of the Thames, and
has been open since the 19th
century. Recently renovated
beautifully by Caruso St John, it
houses a collection of historic and
contemporary British art, and is
the host of the controversial annual
Turner Prize. Tate Modern, located
on the south bank, cuts a striking
figure; housed in a former power
station, it features a collection
of international modern and
contemporary art.
Every year an artist is invited to
fill the large turbine hall, usually
with an extraordinary commission.

National Gallery
The grandaddy of British art
institutions, this houses a
comprehensive collection of public
art from 1200-1900. Taking up an
entire side of Trafalgar Square, this
sprawling gallery is easy to get lost
in, and it is near impossible to visit
it without seeing something new. In
order to avoid the tourist crowds of
doom that congregate outside, plan
your visit for a time that will be quiet
– definitely not at the weekend.
