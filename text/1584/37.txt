In case you
missed it...
In Rugby League,St Helens won
the Grand Final against Wigan
Warriors.However the game
was marred by a shocking punch
by Ben Flower on Lance Hohaia.
Flower has since been banned for
six months–the longest in Super
League history.
The BBC revealed their Price
of Football Survey results.
Manchester City was found to
have the cheapest season tickets,
whilst Arsenal yet again came
up as the most expensive team
to see.
In actual football news,
England were unconvincing in
their victories over San Marino
and Estonia.Germany and
Netherlands have also been
struggling,with Germany only
taking one point from two
games,while the Netherlands
have only won one of their first
three.
Lewis Hamilton extended his
lead in Formula One in Russia
last week.However,the bigger
news is that World Champion
Sebastian Vettel has announced
that he will be moving from Red
Bull to Ferrari next year,which
should pave the way for a return
to Mclaren for Fernando Alonso.
Andy Murray's hopes of
qualifying for the World Tour
Finals took a massive blow as he
was dumped out of the Shanghai
Masters in the third round by
David Ferrer.
Steffon Armitage’s potential
shock move to Bath seems to be
in tatters after he was selected for
Toulon in a European Champions
Cup match.If he plays on Sunday
he will be cup-tied,theoretically
ending Bath's interests.As a
result it would end his chances of
playing for England in the World
Cup next year.

Should Formula 1 have visited Russia?
On the 12th of October 2014,
the inaugural Russian Grand
Prix was held in Sochi against
the backdrop of the facilities used
in this year’s Winter Olympics.
Whilst the first few laps were very
competitive with drivers struggling
to adapt to the track conditions with
a heavy fuel load, throughout the rest
of the race, action was at a premium.
After Nico Rosberg flat-spotted both
front tyres at the second corner,
forcing him to take an extra pit stop,
the race resulted in a comfortable
victory for Lewis Hamilton who was
unchallenged on a track that suited
the superior engine of the Mercedes
cars. Nico Rosberg recovered to finish
in second place and Valteri Bottas
utilised the Mercedes engine in the
back of his Williams to pick up the
final podium position.
Whilst the race was not one of the
most exciting in terms of on-track
action, there were huge levels of
controversy surrounding a move to
Russia – especially in the wake of a
perceived Russian involvement in the
Ukraine conflict. On the backdrop
of the Ukrainian government
announcing an intention for the
country to join the European Union,
anti-government and pro-Russian
groups protested in the streets in
many major towns and cities across
the south and east of Ukraine. These
demonstrations quickly turned
violent with insurgents taking over
key strategic positions including
local government offices and border
control. It has been suggested that
Russia supplied weaponry and special
forces ground troops to support those
who wanted to rejoin the country.
Vladimir Putin also made it his goal
to recapture the southern region of
Crimea which he achieved during the
height of the conflict. In an attempt
to restore order, Ukrainian troops
have been sent to the east of the
country but the turmoil is ongoing.
To hold a highly regarded world
sporting event against the backdrop
of war seems, at least at first glance,
to be a poor decision. Perhaps this
is why the race was held in Sochi -
hundreds of miles away from the
realities of war and against the
backdrop of what Russia aspires to
be, in Putin’s favourite city. It is
certainly feasible that the race was
a ploy to persuade the rest of the
world that Russia could continue
to host world class events and a
demonstration of the wealth that
the country still has despite various
restrictions applied by the United
Nations.
Formula 1 is no stranger to
controversy over the destinations it
visits. The 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix
was postponed and subsequently
cancelled after turmoil in the country
whilst the 2012 edition went ahead
despite campaigns by groups of
activists against the extreme force
and torture techniques used by the
Bahrain authorities on its people.
Many of the destinations visited
on the Formula 1 calender are
places where large portions of the
population are incredibly poor and
the lavish nature of the Formula 1
coupled with the colossal fees paid for
the privilege of hosting a race mean
that protests occur at many events
with the level of public dissatisfaction
having increased in the wake of the
global recession.
The sport has always sought to
shy away from the politics of the
host country in the hope that the
event can transcend the differences
between people but a race is always
used as an opportunity to publicise
the location. No more so than in
Russia with coverage of Vladimir
Putin’s movements included in
the television streaming whilst the
race was still happening. Significant
time was given to shots of Putin and
Bernie Ecclestone in conversation
sitting in a sparsely populated
grandstand. Granted, having one
of the most powerful world leaders
turning up at a sporting event means
a great deal in terms of exposure for
the sport but they are very rarely
shown mid race.
A major part of the success of
Formula 1 has been the sports ability
to reach out to the world and attract
a diverse global audience. For a sport
with nine teams based in England and
the other two still within Europe, it
seems incredible that people in far off
countries would turn out for an event
of this nature. To extend this to a
population of over 140 million people
whilst reaping economic benefits for
both parties can only be perceived
as an excellent idea. However,
unintentionally or not, the sport has
become a prominent political outlet
for the countries it visits and this is
unacceptable.
The event was significantly
overshadowed by the presence of
Vladimir Putin and the coverage that
he received during the race. The real
question after this weekend of motor
sport is Should politics be purged
from Formula 1?

Imperial College Fencers Lunging to the top
Imperial College has qualified four
fencers for the individual and
team events of the prestigious
2014 Commonwealth Fencing
Championships in Largs, Scotland
this November. This event is held
every four years; fencing is not part
of the Commonwealth Games but the
medals will be the same as the ones
given in the Commonwealth Games!
Imperial’s fencers are Maiyuran
Ratneswaran (English number
three in sabre); Zoe Robinson
(English number one in sabre);
Glen Ostacchini, who graduated
earlier this year but qualified
while still an Imperial student and
currently ranked number one in
Wales in foil; and Jamie Simpson,
who will be representing Northern
Ireland in epee – ranked second in
Northern Ireland. Both Maiyuran
and Jamie have previously competed
in the Junior Commonwealth
Championships, Jamie in the
2012 Championships in St. Helier,
Jersey and Maiyuran in the 2009
Championships in Penang, Malaysia
where he carved up the opposition
to gain an individual silver and team
gold. Maiyuran also competed in
the 2010 Commonwealth Fencing
Championships in Melbourne
Australia, where he again slashed his
way to the podium winning the team
event and finishing second in the
individual event.
It isn’t just fantastic individual
results that Imperial can be proud of
though – last year, Imperial Fencing
gained the most BUCS points of
any University. Imperial Men’s
1st team won both the 2013/14
Premiership South and the 2014
BUCS Championships remaining
undefeated, while the Women’s
1st team won the 2013 BUCS
Championships. Imperial also has
the most fencing teams of any UK
University so there are opportunities
for anyone to represent the College.
The Club isn’t just for the competitive
though – everyone is welcome! If
you have been fencing for years,
have never picked up a sword before
or even if you are still sitting on the
fence, then come along to one of
our training sessions or sign up to
one of our novice courses that run
throughout the year.
