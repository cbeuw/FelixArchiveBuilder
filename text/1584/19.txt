National Theatre
Just a short walk from the
Southbank Centre, this awesome,
bunker-esque building is arguably
the home of British theatre. Pretty
much anyone who’s anyone in the
theatre world will pass through
its doors at one point or another.
Furthermore, every year they release
tens of thousands of £15 tickets for a
range of productions, making this a
top choice for students.
Season Highlight
The James Plays: A series of
three plays set in the 15th
Century,
focussing on three generations of
Scottish kings, this epic production
is the jewel in the NT’s crown this
autumn. After a widely lauded
premier at the Edinburgh Fringe
Festival, these productions have
become the hot ticket this season.
Look out for a standout performance
in James III from Danish actor Sofie
Gråbøl, best known for her star role
in The Killing. It’ll all be over by
November so book soon! (10th

Season Highlight
Charles III
A
Wyndham's
Theatre
Located just off Upper Street in
Islington, this theatre may be
small – with a capacity of only
325 – but more than makes up for
that with its international ambition.
A recent string of exceptional hits,
including Chimerica, American Psycho,
and 1984, the Almeida has cemented
its claim as the most exciting theatre

Donmar Warehouse
Nestled among restaurants
and cafes in Seven Dials,
right next to Covent Garden,
the Donmar Warehouse is another
small venue churning out quality
productions.
WIth former directors including
Sam Mendes (American Beauty) and
Michael Grandage, the theatre has
always attracted big names, including
Tom Hiddleston, who was soaked
in blood earlier this year for their
production of Coriolanus. Tickets
do sell out fast, so be sure to book in
advance.
Season Highlight
Henry IV This autumn sees the
return of director Phyllida Lloyd,
whose 2012 all-female production
of Julius Caesar was a landmark in
the history of Shakespeare. Turning
her attention to one of Shakespeare’s
greatest historical plays, Lloyd has
again brought in an all-female cast, in
what is sure to be a groundbreaking
reinterpretation of a classic. (3rd

Former home of the National
Theatre, the Old Vic has a
prolific history, stretching
back to the early 19th
Century. Known
for its mix of modern and classical
drama, the company is under the
helm of US actor/director Kevin
Spacey, who assumed the role of
Artistic Director in 2003. Down the
road, you can find its sister company
The Young Vic, which stages newer

Season Highlight
Electra Critically acclaimed French/
British actor Kristin Scott Thomas
takes on the title role in this ancient
drama from Sophocles. Staged in the
round, it is a classic tale of power,
anger and revenge.
A highly-charged epic, this
promises to be a must-see production
this autumn. (22nd

Billion, this offers a much-needed
discussion on the very real terror
of man-made environmental
devastation. (5th
