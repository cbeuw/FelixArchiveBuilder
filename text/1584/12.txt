"New
approach to
classifying
ovarian
tumours"
The correct medical assessment
of women with ovarian cancer
is essential to ensure they
receive effective, targeted treatment.
Currently, a significant gap in the
efficiency of care for ovarian cancer
patients is due to accurate diagnosis
of the exact stage of their tumour. If
the stage is known then appropriate
surgical procedures can be performed
minimising the risk and potential
impact on fertility. A more accurate
method for diagnosing ovarian
tumours before surgery would
therefore help doctors prioritise
patients for treatment based on the
severity of their condition, improving
the overall efficiency and flow of care.
Existing models can help doctors
discriminate between benign and
malignant tumours but a lack of
accuracy and the ability to further
sub-classify tumours into their
different classes doesn’t exist.
This is all about to change, with
research from an international team
led by Imperial College London and
KU Leauven, Belgium. With their
combined efforts a new test, called
ADNEX, has been developed that
is able to discern between not only
benign and malignant tumours, but
also reliably distinguish between
more specific stages of benign,
invasive and metastatic ovarian
tumours.
Professor Tom Bourne, from the
Department of Surgery and Cancer at
Imperial College London, said “At the
moment, the way we assess women
with ovarian cysts for the presence
of cancer and select treatment lacks
accuracy. This new approach to
classifying ovarian tumours can help
doctors make the right management
decisions, which will improve the
outcome for women with cancer.”
The ADNEX test is based on details
of patients such as tumour marker
blood tests and features that can
be determined on an ultrasound
scan, giving not only an accurate
identification of the type of tumour
but also gives the confidence of
diagnosis as a percentage.
The research looks sound, having
used an extensive data set from 3,506
patients from over 10 EU countries
between 1999 and 2007 the team
has determined which information
available before an operation could be
used to predict the diagnosis and then
tested the model on a further 2,403
patients between 2009 and 2012.
Incredibly, doctors can even
enter the patient’s details into a
smartphone app – giving a futuristic
efficiency to the medical procedure.
The test is available online from
iotagroup.org.
The results from this extensive
Good news for authors of
physics textbooks! As we’ve
long believed, the decay of
radioactive isotopes doesn’t fluctuate
depending on the time of year.
So why is this news? In 2012, a paper
was published by a group at Purdue
University that seemed to show the
rate of decay of Chlorine-36 varied
periodically over the course of the
year.
Based on the times when the decay
was fastest, the authors speculated
that neutrinos emitted from the Sun
could be causing this variation if
the earth is closer to the sun, more
neutrinos will hit the chlorine nuclei
and this will cause more decays and
more radiation to be emitted.
Neutrinos are produced when
radioactive nuclei decay to release
beta particles. On the face of it then,
it seems reasonable that they could
be used to provoke a nucleus to decay
and emit radiation.
The trouble with this theory is that
neutrinos are notoriously unwilling
to react with anything at all. Just
detecting their presence requires
huge underground caverns filled
with detectors, and even then, only
a tiny handful of the trillions that
pass through each minute will ever be
picked up.
A team of physicists in Germany
have used a different equipment
set up to see if they could replicate
these apparent fluctuations. Their
results, published in the journal
Astroparticle Physics showed that the
differences between measurements
are an order of magnitude smaller
than those seen in the previous
research. What’s more, the variation
was completely random, showing no
relationship with the time of year
and casting further doubt on the solar
neutrino theory. The same group
has also produced similar results
for Strontium-90 which showed no
seasonal variation in its rate of decay.
While this new research may not
seem quite as exciting as a ground-
breaking, textbook-rewriting
new discovery, it is a rather nice
demonstration of the scientific
process, and does confirm that what
we think we know about radioactivity
does still seem to be accurate.

study, published this week in the
British Medical Journal, signify a
huge medical advancement in the way
doctors treat ovarian cancer patients
and will hopefully give more reliable
diagnoses and further reduce the risks
associated with such diseases.
