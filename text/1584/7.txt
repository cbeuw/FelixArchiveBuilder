The Union held its first ever
alcohol free club night – “Dri”
on Monday 13th. Unlucky for
some; most likely the bar manager’s
profit margins, and anyone who
turned up.
A full complement of security staff
were on hand to deal with the rowdy
non-crowd of non-drinkers, and with
lime soda priced at 20p to lubricate
the masses, the chance of breaking
even was always going to be slim.
An anonymous Union source said
“We literally had to turn people away,
and people kept asking if this was a
regular thing”.
On offer throughout the evening
were several giant games, a selection
of mocktails and the kitchen was also
open an hour later.
However, when customers found
out they couldn’t buy alcohol, “they
literally turned around and walked
out.”
The budget for this year’s event was
£3000 less than a normal Monday
night when alcohol is available,
although the Union never intended
for the event to make a profit in the
first place. It is reassuring that the
Union aims high when organising
events however; Alex Savell, Deputy
President (Finance and Services), said
that the event was ran as “ not for
profit; we ran it as a service.”
Around one hundred people are
thought to have attended the evening
in total.
The highlight of the evening was
easily DJ Sue, who, in fairness, spun
out some absolute classics across
FiveSixEight. Despite her smooth
grooves at one point it was “literally
the bar staff and the DJ.”
With Metric empty apart from
those who had just served time on
the Union Council and FiveSixEight
populated by those few who live in
Beit and can’t cook for themselves,
the atmosphere allegedly “left a lot to
be desired.”
Chris Kaye spoke to Felix about
the event afterwards. As one of
his manifesto pledges to provide
events for non-drinkers, Chris was
a key driving force behind Dri. “I
personally think this night was not
unsuccessful. We were able to provide
an event that was suitable for not just
non-drinkers, but those students that
are under 18s, which, due to licencing
restrictions, couldn’t previously enter
the Union bars.
It is difficult to get people into
Metric at the best of times, especially
without liquid lubrication.”
Lesson learnt: never go in Dri

RCSU Ballin’... in moderation
OFFICIAL FELIX BALLER
JASPER MENKUS
In my ancestral Tennessee, we have
a saying: “if it ain’t broke, don’t
fix it”. Certainly this appears to be
the approach the RCSU has adopted
in regards to their entertainments
over the last few years. The recipe
goes something like this 1) Take a
dark room in Central London. 2)
Add some loud music. 3) Fill with
scientists soaked in inexpensive (or
free) alcohol. Shake and serve over ice
with a garnish of mint leaves.
The mixture is simple but effective
– in some cases cripplingly so.
Details do change Monday’s DJ was
probably the worst in recent memory
(seriously, who mixes Don’t Stop
Believin’ with Who Let the Dogs
Out? Who does that? Who? Who?).
Opal is a pretty uninspiring venue,
being essentially like Metric but with
nicer seats. But on the whole, the
formula is a tried-and-tested crowd
pleaser despite a nasty suit-ruining
downpour, so many students turned
up that at times Opal’s dancefloor
threatened to burst at the seams. The
number of no-shows and nappers in
Tuesday morning’s lectures testified
to an enjoyable night, and the most
common complaint was, “I can’t
believe they rickrolled us!”, after Rick
Astley’s one-hit wonder filled the
sound system shortly after midnight.
Decrying student drinking as
‘dangerous’, or ‘irresponsible’ appears
to be something of a national pastime
these days. I think the critics don’t
realise how healthy it is to have the
occasional raucous night with old
friends and new faces alike. RCSU
Welfare Officer Akash Jyoti later
mentioned that RCSU’s balls would
be good for student welfare on the
whole (although this is far from being
official RCSU policy).
It’s true that this was one of
RCSU’s less extravagant events
(what, no vodka luge? No chocolate
fountain? Outrage!), and to those
of us outside the RCSU committee,
‘business as usual’ may seem a
little disappointing. But it’s worth
remembering that events like
this never happen by themselves
organising an event that is a) well-
attended and b) where everyone goes
home happy is a major feat in itself.
Congratulations are due to RCSU
President Serena Yuen and her team
– we look forward to many more such
events over the next year.
