This week at Imperial Cinema
This week,for your viewing pleasure
we have genre-bending double bill
in the form of Tom Cruise's latest
thrillerEdgeofTomorrow and coming
of age dramedy TheFaultinOurStars.
Edge of Tomorrow
Director: Doug Liman
Screenplay: Christopher McQuarrie,
Jez Butterworth
Cast: Tom Cruise,Emily Blunt,
Brendan Gleeson,Bill Paxton
Ever since that couch-jumping
incident left him a bit of a laughing
stock,Tom Cruise has worked hard
to re-establish himself in his rightful
role as one of the most influential
movie stars.
The last few years have seen him
star in plenty of thrillers with mixed
results but he finally returns to form
with Sci-fi caper EdgeofTomorrow,
which if reduced to the sum of its
parts is sort of like GroundhogDay
meets CallofDuty.
In the near future,a race of aliens
called Mimics have taken over most
of Europe and Major William Cage
(Tom Cruise) is assigned in a combat
mission to defeat them.
When things go awry,Cage is
quickly killed and soon discovers
that he is stuck in a time-loop,
doomed to repeat the same mission
each time until he is killed and
winds up where he started.This
carries on until he meets Sergeant
Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) who
trains him to become a better
soldier so that together,they can
defeat the alien invasion.
Like most big budget films,Edge
ofTomorrow is laden with stunning
Mr Turner: Festival Gala
Timothy Spall won the prestigious
Best Actor prize at Cannes this year,
for his masterful work in Mike
Leigh’s Mr Turner. The film looks
at the last years of eccentric British
painter J. M. W. Turner’s life. Also
co-starring Mike Leigh’s regular
collaborators, Ruth Sheen, Dorothy
Atkinson, Marion Bailey, Martin
Savage and Lesley Manville. This
is certainly a must-see for fans of
one of the greatest British directors
currently working.
Foxcatcher: American
Express Gala
The true story of paranoid
schizophrenic John du Pont (Steve
Carell) murdering Olympic champion
Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo), brother
of wrestling champion Mark Schultz
(Channing Tatum), has been winning
rave reviews ever since its debut at
Cannes. Critics are singling out the
performances, Carell’s in particular,
and the film is looking to be a
frontrunner in this year’s awards
race.
Whiplash: Accenture Gala
Already a big winner at Sundance
earlier this year, both with the critics
and the public (they don’t always see
eye to eye), as well as enjoying some
excellent publicity at Telluride and
Toronto, this indie hit tells the story
of a gifted young jazz drummer (Miles
Teller) and his ruthless mentor (J. K.
Simmons) who pushes his student
to achieve greatness. Get ready for a
wholly original music drama.
Men, Women & Children:
Virgin Atlantic Gala
Critically-acclaimed director Jason
Reitman returns with Men, Women
& Children this year, focusing on
the challenges of raising a family
in today’s world run by technology.
Regardless of age or gender, there
are problems that affect us all, as
Reitman explores the difficulties
of keeping it all together, starring
an ensemble cast of Adam Sandler,
Jennifer Garner, Judy Greer and
more.
Wild: May Fair Hotel Gala
Reese Witherspoon is hoping for
a comeback, given how a string of
unremarkable roles have taken over
her career post-Oscar-win. Directed
by Jean-Marc Vallée, Wild finds
Witherspoon as a reckless, destructive
addict going on a self-healing solo
hike across the Pacific Crest Trail.
The film itself is receiving mixed
reviews, but Witherspoon is winning
praise for her performance.
Testament of Youth:
Centrepiece Gala
Based on Vera Brittain’s first
installment of her memoir, Testament
of Youth is being brought to the
big screen. It will cover the period
of 1900-1925 in Brittain’s life, in
which she describes the impact of
the First World War on women.
Swedish actress Alicia Vikander
(Anna Karenina, A Royal Affair, The
Fifth Estate) stars as Brittain, with
Brit talent Kit Harington playing her
fiancé, Roland Leighton.
Rosewater: Debate Gala
Jon Stewart, perhaps best known
for his work in the United States
as a talk-show host, makes his
directorial debut portraying the
story of Maziar Bahari (Gael Garcia
Bernal), an Iranian Canadian
journalist, who was incarcerated by
the Iranian government for 188 days.
It promises to be a well-crafted, tense
political drama with some powerful
performances from the cast.
Mommy: Dare Gala
Xavier Dolan is somewhat of a
critical darling, given how successful
his films have been in the festival
circuit. His films are certainly not
for mainstream audiences, dealing
with complex, controversial issues.
His latest feature film, Mommy, is his
best-reviewed work yet, dealing with
a widowed mother trying to raise her
violent son alone, when a neighbour
enters her life to help out.
A Little Chaos: Love Gala
Director Alan Rickman also stars in
this period piece, playing King Louis
XIV, who hires a gardener in the form
of Sabine De Barra (Kate Winslet) to
transform his garden at the Palace of
Versailles. There is initial resistance
from the strict garden chief (Matthias
Schoenaerts), but with her fresh new
innovative ideas she starts to charm
all those around her.
Wild Tales: Laugh Gala
Brought to you by producer Pedro
Almodovar, this comedy offering
seems to live up to its name of
being outrageously hilarious. As six
separate wildly funny tales come
together for the final climax, critics at
Cannes were clearly pleased enough
with the result. It is a dark comedy for
sure, with its humour focusing on the
troubles of modern life.
The Salvation: Thrill Gala
Set in the Wild West where the
rules are there are no rules; the
charismatic Mads Mikkelsen is off
on a quest for vengeance (aren’t they
always?), tracking down the murderer
of his family. Things don’t end just
with hunting down that one man
however, as there are more betrayals
in store for him, setting up a tough,
bloody mission with a rising body
count.
Winter Sleep: Journey Gala
This three-hour long (196 minutes to
be more precise) epic was a crowd-
divider when it debuted at Cannes
earlier this year, although that did
not stop it from walking away with
the festival’s top honour, the Palme
d’Or. Love it or hate it, this Turkish
epic is one for the more inquisitive
cinema-goers, to see if you can
appreciate it in any way or not.
visual effects but more impressively,
never loses track of the very human
narrative at its centre.

The Fault in Our Stars
Director: Josh Boone
Screenplay: Scott Neustadter,
Michael H.Weber,John Green (novel)
Cast: Chris Pratt,Zoe Saldana,Dave
Bautista,Vin Diesel,Bradley Cooper
Adapted from the best-selling Young
Adult novel of the same name,The
FaultinOurStarstells the love story
of two teenagers who meet at a
cancer support group.
When Hazel Lancaster's (Shailene
Woodley) thyroid cancer suddenly
worsens,she is forced by her mother
to attend a support group for teens
with cancer. After years of doctor’s
appointments and hospitals,Hazel
is understandably cynical about
yet more attempts to‘help’.At the
session she meets Augustus Waters
who is in remission and has a
decidedly more optimistic outlook
on life.They quickly bond over
their love of books and their shared
experiences with cancer and soon
enough they fall in love.
Amidst the ecstasy of young love,
Hazel's health deteriorates and both
must learn to confront their fear of
dying and losing each other.
Despite its bleak subject matter,
TheFaultinOurStars expertly
combines comedy and tragedy,in
no small part aided by excellent
performances from its two leads.
