Top 5 Memberships
There are a good number of
reasons why you may want
to join one or more of the
plethora of membership schemes
offered across the capital. Do you
want to show off to everyone how
cultured you are? Maybe you simply
can’t stand to queue. Perhaps you
relish going to members-only areas.
Hopefully though, the number one
reason is that you love soaking up
any exhibition that comes flying onto
your radar. And so I’ve compiled a
list of my memberships, answering
questions like “Is it worth the
money?” ; “what benefits do I get?” ;
and most importantly “what is the
members’ bar like?”
5Royal Museums
Greenwich
This is not one that a lot of people
would have considered but this
gives you access to a collection of
underappreciated museums. You’ll
get free access to the Cutty Sark, the
Royal Observatory, The Meridian
Courtyard and to any and all special
exhibitions held at these locations.
Membership is £35 for students and
also grants you access to lectures,
tours and other events, a lovely
members room and a quarterly
newsletter. If you are particularly
interested in astronomy, you can join
the Flamsteed Astronomy Society for
an extra £28 for lectures from leading
astronomers and viewing sessions,
including the opportunity to use
the 28-inch telescope and the solar
telescope.
The Tate
This a big membership, giving
entry to all the Tate Galleries’ special
exhibitions and, other than the art
fund, is the membership that gives
you access to the most exhibitions.
With the membership you will also
get access to members rooms at the
Tate Britain and Tate Modern, the
latter having a rooftop terrace with
commanding views over the City and
St Paul’s. So why isn’t this higher up
the list then? Well it really is quite
expensive, as membership starts
at £69 for individual membership,
with no discount for students and
aside from the expected free entry to
exhibitions and the magazine, there
really are no more member benefits.
Hence, it entirely boils down to the
question, “Will I visit an exhibition
at the Tate five or more times a year?”
If yes, then become a member, you’ll
save money. If no, then don’t bother,
they don’t offer enough additional
benefits to make it worth paying over
the odds for access.
The British Museum
Only £42 a year for membership;
you have no doubt visited and
thoroughly enjoyed the British
Museum before. In my opinion, they
put together some of the very best
special exhibitions that exist in the
capital. Membership allows you free
access to all exhibitions and there
are also late night members’ hours,
a fantastic way to see the standing
collections without the throngs of
tourists congesting every nook and
cranny of the museum. In addition,
you’ll get invites to lectures, films,
and guided talks. As with all the
memberships, you’ll receive a
magazine thrice a year, and this one
is actually a good read and really
adds something to the membership.
All in all, if you frequent the British
Museum then this is certainly a
membership worth buying.
National Art Pass
An absolute steal at £29 (£21.75
if you pay by direct debit) for the
year and if you were to buy only
one membership I’d suggest this
as it gives you such broad benefits.
This includes free access to over
200 museums, galleries and historic
houses in the UK including Apsley
House, 2 Willow Road and the Fan
Museum (not as good as it sounds).
You also get 50%off exhibitions at a
lot of places including all the Tates
(except St. Ives), all the Exhibition
Road museums, the British Museum,
the National Gallery, the National
Portrait Gallery and a number of
One of the best arts deals in London, with only £45 a year giving you access to the multitude
of exhibitions across the year. Photo: Creative Commons
Jack Leese looks the capital’s best art memberships
others. This ‘jack of all trades, master
of none’ membership is a very useful
one to have and I would advise getting
it despite the lack of some of the perks
of other memberships.
The Royal Academy of
Arts
Membership aside, it’s an absolute
gem of a gallery. Unusually, there is
no standing collection but instead
a high turnover of excellent feature
shows. Every summer they hold their
Summer Exhibition, as they have
done since 1769 without fail, and it is
usually my favourite exhibition with
over a thousand pieces of art hung,
giving a fantastic cross-section of the
art world of the moment. Becoming a
friend of the R.A. is only £45 if you’re
under 25, and £97 if you happen to
be older. Given that the exhibitions
usually cost around £15, that’s only
three visits a year to cover your costs.
You will also get invited to members-
only previews of all the exhibitions,
late opening hours, and access to
The Keeper’s House with its several
lounges, coffee room, excellent
cocktail bar and private garden, as
well as lecture theatres if you fancy
attending one of their free lectures.
You will also receive the quarterly
R.A. magazine, one of the better
magazines which doesn’t solely focus
on it’s own exhibitions. Additionally,
this membership allows entry for a
guest without having to pay extra for
a guest card. What I’m trying to say is
that if you decide to take the plunge
and become a member of a gallery,
the R.A. is definitely the one you
should join above all others.
"Do you

you are?"

Art Pass is

Freshers’Fortnight has finally
finished.The floor of the union
has regained its sticky residue
of spilled pints that was so
thoroughly scrubbed away over
the summer; red lanyards lie
scattered and abandoned around
campus like so many red poppies
on the 12th of November; your
liver will never be the same
again.
So as people begin to piece
themselves back together after
two weeks of madness,we
thought that it was the perfect
time to put out a bumper art
section,detailing all the cultural
activites that London has to offer.
We start off with our Artist's
GuidetoLondon,a compendium
of all the best places to visit in
London,curated by your trusty
editors.Whether you have a
thing for classical sculpture,
or are already salivating at
the thought of this season's
new contemporary dance
programme,you will find
something to suit.
As well as covering the main
galleries and venues,we answer
an age old question: Private
Galleries:Whataretheyallabout?,
helping you make sense of all
the spaces popping up around
London.Don't worry if you're not
an oligarch art collector; all you
need to do to fit in at these places
is buy a black turtleneck from
H&M and talk about how the
work‘just speaks to you’.
It can be difficult to afford to
go to all the exhibitions you want
to on a student's budget.Luckily,
Jack Leese has investigated which
galleries offer the best student
memberships,and reports
back with his Top5Memberships,
helping you get the most out of
your student loan (why spend all
that dough at the union when
you could be seeing the hottest
Klee exhibit!?)
