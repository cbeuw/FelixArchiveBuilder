NUS rejects
motion to
condemn ISIS
The National Union of Students
(NUS) has rejected a motion
condemning Islamic State after
a stirring speech by Black Students
Officer Malia Bouattia, in which she
asserted that passing the motion
would be akin to “a justification for
war and blatant Islamaphobia (sic)”.
The motion said that the NUS
would “support unity between
Muslims, condemn the bloody terror
of ISIS, and support a boycott on
people who fund the militants”.
In response, leading proposer of
the motion Daniel Cooper said that
he has “looked again and again at the
contents of the motion, yet I cannot
track any Islamophobia or racism”.
Bouattia was quick to add that
the NUS Black Students’ Campaign
“stand[s] in complete solidarity with
the Kurdish people against the recent
attacks by ISIS and join many others
in condemnation of their brutal
actions”.

“The NUS Black Students’
Campaign will be working
with Kurdish students and the
International Students Campaign
to raise this issue within the NUS.
A motion will be taken to the next
NUS National Executive, which truly
reflects the situation. This motion
will pose a condemnation of the
politics and methods of ISIS as well as
unequivocal support for the Kurdish
people.”

UCH Redev “rather better than expected”
BEN HOWITT
NEWS REPORTER
In January 2014, Felix reported
on the award of a £220,000
Harlington grant to redevelop the
Union Concert Hall, where Imperial
Cinema and various performing arts
societies present shows, films and
concerts.
We interviewed George Goldberg
from Imperial Cinema about the
redevelopment, who characterised
the end result as “rather better than
expected”.
The Harlington application, it
results, was written over the space of
a month and submitted in October
2013, but the broader plan has been
being discussed for a number of years.
DramSoc and Imperial Cinema
tendered the application, with
MTSoc, Medics’ Drama and
Medics’ Light Opera supporting the
document.
The ceiling has been raised and
extensive rewiring has taken place,
as well as repainting the interior
and rebuilding the projection booth.
The aim was to allow the space to be
used as a multiplex – with Cinema
showings and shows, conferences etc.
taking place in quick succession.
The project has managed in
consultation with representatives
from the Union’s Central Services,
DramSoc and Imperial Cinema –
which seems to have ensured that
appearing problems were dealt with
promptly.
“What did happen [to the
application] was the initial vision
wasn’t well communicated… but since
then, [it’s] got much closer.”
In addition to the Harlington grant,
the redevelopment was funded by the
Union, with some additional items
being purchased by the societies who
made the application. It is unclear as
yet whether the budget has held, but
the costs seem so far to have been true
to predictions.
In terms of the work left, George
assures us that they have reached “the
final push”. There is work to be done
before the space will be accessible
to newer users of the Concert Hall,
but George hopes to have the facility
ready for Spring Term.
NBA legend Abdul-Jabbar
joins diabetes campaign
NBA legend Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar announced this week
that he will be kicking off
a diabetes week in the United Arab
Emirates. Imperial College London’s
Diabetes Centre (ICLDC) is the
title partner of the Take a Step for
Diabetes Week, which this year will
start on the 28th October.
CEO of the ICLDC Bashar Al
Ramahi said of the announcement,
“We are very excited to have Kareem
visit the UAE in support of ICLDC’s
healthy lifestyle campaign. His
participation in various community
events hosted by our centres in Abu
Dhabi and Al Ain will really help re-
enforce the message that a balanced
diet and regular exercise are the
smart, simple steps needed.”
The event forms part of the
ICLDC’s awareness campaign,
Diabetes-Knowledge-Action, which
was launched in 2007.
Imperial College London Diabetes
Centre is a “state-of-the-art out-
patient facility” that specialises in
diabetes care.
It has two centres, one based in Abu
Dhabi and the other in Al Ain, both
in the United Arab Emirates.
Abdul-Jabbar is considered an NBA
legend, especially during his fourteen

The original plan included the
installation of raked seating. It
turns out, though, that significant
structural work would be required
to strengthen the floor prior to
installation, and the plan was (at
least temporarily) shelved. George
reassures us that “The work that’s
been done… doesn’t preclude a Phase
Two.”
Post redevelopment, the hall’s
use has been restricted. ACC
Cheerleading and Dodgeball both
used the facility for regular practices
last year, but have now had to find
alternative space, allegedly owing
to the risk of damage to the new
fittings. There will also be an ongoing
maintenance plan, to ensure that the
facility does not deteriorate.
When interviewed in January, Yas
Edwards (then the DPCS) stated that
the redevelopment should allow
drama and music groups to make
regular use of the space.
It is unclear how this will be
administrated, with large portions
of the term already booked out for
DramSoc, MTSoc and Imperial
Cinema events.
