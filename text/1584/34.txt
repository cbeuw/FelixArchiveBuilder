Nonogram Cat Sudoku
Acrostic Grid by Paul G.
Each row and column must consist of a series of shaded and unshaded boxes.The number
of shaded boxes is mentioned beside and above each row and column (e.g.1,2,...might
mean some unshaded boxes,1 shaded box,some more unshaded,2 shaded,and so on).
Solve the puzzle to reveal a pretty picture or a coded message.
The solutions to each pair of clues are anagrams of one another,but
only one of them belongs in the grid.When the correct solutions from
each pair have all been entered,the first column will give the name of a
museum.
Just like a normal Sudoku,but with cats instead of numbers.You might say the cat had
9 lives,in fact! Each row,column,and 3 by 3 square must contain every one of the cat’s 9
postures.Good luck,and happy doodling!
