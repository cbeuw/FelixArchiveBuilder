College cuts amenities funds for halls

College has slashed the Amenity
funds available to Halls of
Residence by a quarter of
a million pounds, sparking fury
amongst Hall Wardens and Seniors.
The amount allocated to all halls
this year was just over £150,000,
down from approximately £373,000
in previous years. From this
£150,000, around £42,000 comes
from the Education Office, whilst
the rest has been derived from the
rents students are paying to live in
halls, approximately £1 per week per
student.
The reasoning behind the cuts
according to Imperial College was to
“put money back into the pockets of
students” and that rent prices will not
have risen as highly as a result.
However, at time of print, the
exact rent figures have still not been
released to Felix so we cannot verify
if this is the case.
It has been suggested by those
affected that the money has gone
“back into the pockets of commercial
services”, although this is not certain.
The cuts have lead to a reduction
of £220,000 in the funds available to
all the Halls to cover for events and
pastoral care provisions.
The decrease in Amenities Funds
has resulted in a knock on effect for
both the Freshers’ Events and the
provisions for Hall Seniors, who
moved in a week before the new
intake in September. There was less
funding available for Hall Senior
training, and nor was there allegedly
enough money available for welfare
provisions which are usually paid for
using this fund.
Hall seniors have also come forward
to say that because events can no
longer be as heavily subsidised,
ticket prices have to increase as a
result and may deter students with
less disposable income in getting
involved.
One senior said “Essentially a
50%cut in your budget has exactly
the effect you'd imagine. Either we
halve the number of your events or
reduce the quality of them.”
“This Freshers’ Fortnight we've
had to strike a balance between the
two; we’ve reduced the budgets for
party nights and had to host more
‘film nights’ in the common room
to replace events we can no longer
afford to run.”
Another Hall Senior says “We've
managed to keep our calendar for
Freshers’ Fortnight intact but it
will come with a reduction in future
events; nights like Halloween are
highly unlikely to have parties now.”
It is not just events that are
suffering from the cuts. One Hall
Senior told us how they usually could
afford to produce and print a help
manual for students using the funds,
but this had to be cut because of the
lack of funds. “It is the Freshers that
are missing out.”
One Assistant Warden told us, “We
have had to cut back events such
as trips to London Eye or London
Tours. Such trips are more expensive,
but aren’t alcohol related so aren’t
particularly exclusionary. Not all
events halls do are actually about
alcohol, although it seems that
College has this impression that
alcohol is all that halls spend their
money on.”
“These cuts mean not being able to
put on the events we usually provide,
which arguably detracts from the
student experience.”
“Campus services should not exist
to make money out of students.”
The Warden Discretionary Fund
has also been cut down to £200 per
Hall. This cost was previously used
for pastoral costs, such as “welfare
cards”, that provide essential welfare
contacts on them and before now
were given to all students. This year
the College no longer supplied these,
so some Halls had to use the Warden
Discretionary fund to pay for these
instead in.
Hall senior motivation has also
dropped as a result. Said one source,
“There were no funding for team
building and training during the
week before the students moved in,
and it has lead to a drop in morale.”
“The litmus test will be to see who
still wants to be a Hall Senior next
year.”
In some Halls, Wardens themselves
have been reportedly known to cover
the costs of such provisions, although
this is beyond their remit and
responsibility.
The decision to cut the funding was
made as a response to the Residential
Experience Review, undertaken
earlier this year. The Review,
conducted by senior members of staff
in College, along with the then Union
President David Goldsmith and
Deputy President (Welfare) Marissa
Lewis, also scrutinised the Wardening
system, residential staffing and the
College services.
The Residential Experience Review
then produced recommendations for
changes, which were then discussed
with various other college staff
members and the Sabbatical team.
Recommendations for the fund
included that it be reduced to a flat
rate of £1 per student per week,
and that: “It should not be used to
subsidise high cost trips or events,
but should focus on activities that…
should include a high proportion
of activities without alcohol.” The
then Union President and Deputy
President (Welfare) successfully
appealed for this to be increased to
£1.50 to the panel conducting the
Review.
The Amenities fund was in previous
years taken from the rent paid by
students, at a rate determined by
Halls based the rent they paid the
halls they lived in and the type of
room they had.
However, Senior College sources
were unable to pinpoint exactly how
money was allocated per Hall before
now. Said one source,:“Knowledge of
how the funds worked had been lost
at some point.”
It was because of this uncertainty,
and in a bid to aid transparency, that
the decision was made to put the cost
of the fund at a flat rate of £1.50 per
person per week.
The reduction in funds has
been coupled with some benefits.
Financial control of the funds has
been transferred to elected Hall
Committees, who are then able to
claim back VAT on any expenditure.
The financial system that the Union
runs, eActivities, has also been
heralded as easier to use compared
to the previous College-based system
the amenities fund was previousily
managed by.
Deputy President (Welfare) Chris
Kaye said: “Reviewing this is a top
priority and the Union looks forward
to working constructively with
College on this issue.”
