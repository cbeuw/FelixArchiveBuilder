Leicester’s paper
censored by Union
Controversy has broken out at
the University of Leicester
over an attempt to censure
its student paper, The Ripple, by
the students’ union at Leicester. In
an editorial posted on the paper’s
website, Editor in Chief Jess Buckley
expressed her disappointment with
the Leicester union’s decision to hold
back publication by 72 hours whilst
the executive committee determined
if a story on the front page violated a
number of rules.
Unlike at Imperial, media groups
at Leicester are required to have
their output approved by the Union
prior to publication or broadcast
following the introduction of a
“Media Constitution” . The article in
question related to criticisms of the
ongoing elections at the university,
asking whether “there is a lack of
engagement”. According to the
Ripple, the union accused the paper
of writing a number of inaccuracies
and violating the constitution.
Upon probing as to what exactly
the offending text was, no concrete
answer was provided. The issue
was then ultimately authorised
for publication with no changes 72
hours after being first sent in for
authorisation.
According to rules at the union,
a media publication or broadcast
can only be pulled if it contains
content which is illegal, libellous, or
unconstitutional. Where a student
paper is not its own distinct legal
entity (both Felix and the Ripple fall
into this category), legal challenges
against the first two points would fall
to the union’s trustees and not the
paper; whereas constitutional matters
are a purely internal affair. The
requirement for authorisation could
be seen as an attempt for the Union to
‘cover its own back’.
Students have reacted angrily to
the attempt to censure the paper.
On the Ripple’s website, one reader
complained against the “draconian”
nature of union authorisation for
articles; arguing “no wonder The Tab
is so popular”.
A group have students have now
started a campaign for a referendum
to prevent the union from banning
publication.

Imperial Professors
win awards
Two Imperial College academics
have recently been awarded
honours by their professional
bodies, recognising outstanding
achievement in their fields. Honorary
Fellowship of the Institute of Physics
(IoP) has been awarded to Professor
Sir Peter Knight, an Emeritus Profes-
sor in Physics, while Professor Chris
Toumazou has been awarded with the
Faraday Medal.
Sir Peter’s award has been made in
recognition of his contributions to
Physics throughout his career. His
research has focused on quantum
physics; specifically optics and infor-
mation science.
The Fellowship was also made in
recognition of both his work with
the IoP, and also a number of other
responsibilities he has held. These
responsibilities include being Head
of the Physics Department, Deputy
Rector, and playing a key role in set-
ting up a number of research centres
within the College.
Honorary Fellowship is the highest
honour that the Institute of Physics
can award to its members.
Meanwhile, Prof. Toumazou’s
Faraday Medal was awarded for this
research into semiconductor DNA
sequencing. This work is significant
as it allows for the medical profession
to eventually move away from treat-
ing illnesses in the traditional sense
to targeted treatment and prevention.
Additionally, there is the potential
for semiconductor DNA sequencing
to save costs, being much cheaper
than conventional equipment.
Prof. Toumazou, who works in the
Department of Electrical and Elec-
tronic Engineering department, has
also been involved in the creation of
a ‘while you wait’ DNA testing retail
shop, where ‘customers’ can have
their genes analysed in 30 minutes.
This has not been Prof. Toumazou’s
first award in recent years. In 2013, he
was presented with a Regius Profes-
sorship on the occasion of the Queen’s
Jubilee. At 33, he became Imperial’s
youngest professor.
Prof. Toumazou was also named
European Inventor of the Year in
June, as reported by Felix at the end of
that month.
