a night in
the maze"
There is no one like Eva Green
who can play crazy as well as
she can. Known for playing
slightly unhinged, potentially
dangerous women on the verge
of having a complete meltdown,
Green is spot-on in any role that
requires her to be dark and disturbed.
Whether portrayed as a villain or a
victim, the fundamental common
theme that runs through most, if not
all, her characters, is that you should
prepare yourself for a captivating
turn.
Here, Green plays a mother who
mysteriously disappears without a
trace. Her daughter Kat (Shailene
Woodley) takes centre stage in trying
to piece together just what the hell
happened. She reflects on the past,
one that includes many instances of
her mother’s erratic behaviour.
Brock (Christopher Meloni) and
Eve (Green) Connor were supposed
to live out the perfect little suburban
American dream. And to give them
some credit, their early years were
blessed with happy memories. This
is until Eve realises the repetitive,
frustrating nature of her existence
as a bored housewife who is only
concerned with keeping the house
tidy. With very little sex in the
marriage, Brock turns to magazines
and Eve turns to her daughter’s
boyfriend.
Yes, Kat, having reached that
certain age, starts seeing her
neighbour Phil (Shiloh Fernandez)
the-boy-next-door-type who also
takes an interest in her. Their
intensely sexual relationship catches
the envy and bitter disdain of Eve
who stares as Eva Green does best;
with her no-nonsense, piercing gaze
that sends chills down spines. This
is the turning point for Eve. She
starts dressing more provocatively,
speaking more resentfully towards
her husband and daughter and she
begins to drink more, much to the
shock and annoyance of her family
members.
It is in the midst of this madness
Kat has her growing-up to do. White
Bird in a Blizzard is a coming-of-age
story of Kat. A police investigation
gets underway, although it is difficult
to pin-point exactly what happened.
Was Eve taken against her will or
has she done her absolute best to get
away from her monotonous life?
After some digging, there is very
little evidence to support whatever
theory anyone might have about
it, so gradually, Eve becomes a
forgotten figure. The only thing that
comes from the police intervening is
Detective Scieziesciez (Thomas Jane)
who lets himself be seduced by Kat
then proceeds to satisfy her voracious
sexual appetite.
Woodley is conquering all sorts
of genres to add to her impressive
resume; she can tick the box titled
‘twisted little indie’, proving she
really can do pretty much anything
that is required of her. Despite there
being an age gap of only 12 years
between them, Green and Woodley
have a fascinating chemistry. They
can be seen as competitors when it
comes to their search for love and
sex, and when Green exerts her
maternal pressures and powers on
her pubescent daughter, the tension
between the two escalates even more.
Green, as mentioned before, is
a force to be reckoned with. Her
performance is most effective when
she is using her English accent, as
her American one has a hint of
an awkward twinge in there, but
it does not stop her from giving
yet another emotionally draining,
completely gripping, unpredictable
turn. Eve’s slow descent into madness
is undeniably entertaining because
Green does it so well, but at the same
time heart-breaking, because the
two sufferers, Brock and Kat, must
deal with the consequences of such
behaviour.
The story moves on with Kat going
on to college, making new friends and
a new boyfriend, but the past comes
back to haunt her when she returns
home. Now the loose ends must be
tied up and the questions answered.
And with not too many realistic
suspects involved, it does not become
a tricky game of whodunnit. Kat is
almost too blind to see something
that is quite apparent from what is
left behind. But the way the final
scene unfolds sends the feeling
that the film is trying too hard to
be unpredictable. There is such a
sudden change in the way some of
the characters are portrayed that the
final twist becomes too implausible.
It rushes through its ending with the
jaw-drop finale, not quite thinking
through the fact that the characters
we have known throughout the film’s
running time do not quite match up
with what we see in the ending. There
are ways to do a smart, unexpected
ending, the way White Bird in a
Blizzard goes about achieving that is
not quite the most effective.
Teenagers are big business. Due
to the success of franchises
like Harry Potter, Twilight
and the Hunger Games, production
companies are desperate to find the
next big hit to empty teens’ wallets,
and to be the ones that do it first.
This has led to a spate of second-rate
films that haven’t quite made the cut.
Look at the Golden Compass, Mortal
Instruments, I Am Number Four or
Stormbreaker. All of these took books
with large fan bases, enjoyable plots,
twists, turns, and lots of sequels, and
in making them into a film, managed
to take away what made them good
in the first place. It’s easy to make a
film. What is much more difficult
is to make the franchise, and that is
where these films fail. Not a single
one in that list did well enough to get
a sequel.
The Maze Runner, based on the
bestseller by James Dashner, is the
latest of these attempts. And finally,
for what is the first time since
perhaps the Hunger Games, it has
succeeded.
Imagine you wake up in a strange
place, surrounded by people you
don’t know and you can’t remember
anything, not even your own name.
Then you might have an idea how
our protagonist feels at the start of
the Maze Runner. So what do you do
surrounded by all this? The film title
may give you a bit of a hint. You run.
The film starts some pretty speedy
exposition after this. The strange
place our characters are in is called
the Glade. It looks like a fairly idyllic
place, apart from the fact that it is
surrounded by immensely tall walls.
The people are known as Gladers, and
they live by three rules. Everyone
does their part. Never hurt another
Glader. Never go outside the Glade.
The reason for the last rule? The
Glade is surrounded by a maze which
changes layout every night. Every
day Runners go out into the Maze to
map it and try and find a way out. But
only the strongest and fastest of the
Gladers can to do this, as at sundown
the doors to the Maze shut, and
no-one has ever survived a night in
the maze before. There are monsters
in the Maze, known as Grievers. But
of course, no-one has even seen a
Griever either.
The leader of the Glade, Alby,
takes our main character under his
wing, and after a convenient blow
to the head, he remembers his name
as Thomas. But almost as soon
as Thomas starts to feel at home,
things start going wrong. A Glader is
attacked by the Grievers during the
day, sending him into a craze where
he tries to kill Thomas.
At this point the plot, which had
been very exposition heavy, starts
to pick up pace. Mazes are explored,
monsters are battled, and lots of
people fight about lots of things.
One of the major things that can
make these type of films sink or swim
is the acting from the understandably
young cast. The Hunger Games has an
Academy Award winning actress in
the lead role. The Mortal Instruments
– not so much. Many teen franchises
try to counter this by having well
respected actors in the adult roles
(think Kate Winslet in Divergent or
pretty much any of the Professors
in Harry Potter). However as almost
all the characters in the Maze Runner
are young males, this film cannot use
this to distract from potentially poor
perfromances.
Thankfully the Maze Runner
manages to avoid this problem. In
the main role is Dylan O’Brien, in
his first major film role since he rose
to fame in TV’s Teen Wolf. He is very
good at managing to balance between
scared and confused teen to bold and
confident Runner with ease.
The best performances of the films
however, belong to Thomas Brodie-
Sangster and Will Poulter as Newt
and Gally. Though they could easily
come across as the generic ‘Good
Guy’ and ‘Bad Guy’ respectively, they
bring heart to their roles, especially
Poulter in the climax of the film,
proving what he has only hinted at
before – he has the ability to go far in
the acting career.
The look of the film is another
point in its favour; though the
Greivers are a little silly in concept,
they still manage to be the correct
level of scary. The bright greens and
blues of the Glade are juxtoposed with
the dank greys of the Maze, helping
to creat very different moods in each
space.
Overall, though it suffers from a
slow start, the Maze Runner builds
and builds to a fantastic conclusion,
managing to surprise from what
could easily be predicatable.
It’s helped by some excellent
performances from the core cast.
It’s great to finally see the
beginning of what could be the next
big franchise. All there is to do is
wait, and hope that the sequel is just
as good.
