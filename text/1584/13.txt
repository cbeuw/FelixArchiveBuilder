Well, I

clothes"
Exciting times in the corridors
of our university this week, as
the alpha-wankers from The
Apprentice come to visit. Before
this eventful occurrence, I was an
Apprentice virgin (I know, shocking),
but here is what my extensive
watching of the show has taught me.
Whereas most reality TV relies
on archetypal characters to stir up
drama, this programme is more of
a social experiment What happens
when you make twenty identical,
money-driven, Lord Sugar wannabes
interact?
After waking the contestants
up at 05 00 to reach Imperial
College London – obviously not
understanding that early rises
go against the official student
philosophy – Lord Sugar sets them
a task inspired by our institution’s
scientific reputation To design
a fashionable item of wearable
technology. Fashion at Imperial?
Well, I guess we do wear clothes.
At this point the contestants, very
originally divided into boys and
girls, run off in a panic to create this
incredible garment.
And thus ended the College’s fifteen
minutes of fame, as the planning
is not done here but in a swanky
office that you are made to believe
is on the top floor of some amazing
City skyscraper, but is probably
in a basement in Haggerston with
panoramas of London sellotaped to
the windows.
It is in this office that the teams
come up their items essentially a
grey sweater and an M&S jacket,
with lights and buttons. This may
seem easy to us technologically-
gifted nerds, but considering that
the women are unaware of the
importance of exposing solar panels
to the actual sun, the results are
impressive.
On their side, the men create a
slightly creepy Big Brother sweater
with a hidden camera to sneakily
record friends and family in
compromising positions and flashy
Christmas tree inspired decorations.
None of the possible buyers seem
interested in the products (despite the
women’s extensive market research
based on a sample size of one) and one
of the men actually admits he would
never wear his own creation in public.
So let me set the scene; I’m sitting
on my couch, with a few friends
and a healthy supply of wine at
my side.
As the weeks have progressed we’ve
all become more and more addicted
to the pastel-coloured, innuendo-
ridden spectacle that is Great British
Bake Off.
And here it is; the grand finale!
However, despite the high degree
of anticipation in the air, as the last
episode progresses all I can think is
Then Lord Sugar is forced to pick
someone to fire, something that
evidently still fills him with immense
pleasure after all these years. He picks
Wanker 1 and Wanker 2 (no, I don’t
remember their names).
All in all some pretty unsatisfying
watching but, hey, did you see how
shiny we looked on TV?
“meh...”
This year, Paul and Mary decided to
test the finalists on their core baking
skills.
First off was a Danish pastry
challenge which saw the contestants
experiment with various flavour
combinations including raspberry
and chocolate, pear and chocolate,
and apple and lemon.
No, we weren’t that inspired either.
The only exception was Manchester-
based Spaniard Luis, who tried to
raise the bar with his cheese and
apple pastries. And despite Paul’s
judgemental gaze, I would have
happily given them a bite.
The technical bake was an even
less exciting combination of three
baking staples. Despite the time
pressure (three bakes in three hours)
and the ever-looming threat of a
soggy bottom, there is really nothing
that can make watching a scone rise
riveting; even without getting raisins,
the most disgusting food known to
man, involved.
The showstopper challenge was
supposed to be a grand and festive
pièce montée, a massive edible
centrepiece of choux pastries, biscuits,
macaroons and cakes.
This grandiose concept somehow
inspired two contestants to go back to
their roots and pay homage to their
hometowns.
Contestant Nancy – who evidently
didn’t think her birthplace, Hull, was
sufficiently exciting – followed the
French theme and opted to fashion a
sugar sculpture of the Moulin Rouge.
This made her creation essentially
an edible brothel; which wouldn’t
have been my first choice.
As all good things must come to an
end, the winner had to be announced.
Beloved builder Richard was the
favourite, having achieved star-baker
status on a record five occasions.
However you can’t win Bake Off
with a runny jam, and by the end of
the episode his chances seemed pretty
low. So maybe Luis? Thanks to his
extraordinary graphic design skills,
shown from day one, most people
expected him to pull this one of.
And they were all wrong! Because –
spoiler alert – it was Nancy, Queen of
the Backcombed Barnet, who actually
took home the prize.
Admittedly we were all a bit
disappointed, especially as the
husband of the winner joked “I had
no doubt she would win, she always
gets what she wants”. Great, a real
underdog. I guess we will patiently
have to wait for 2015 to satisfy our
new cake cravings…
