Rag M a g Rant
Dear Sir,
In reply to Nigel Atkinson's
letter about the Rag Mag and
the lack of profit that it has
made in recent years, I quite
agree that this situation is
intolerable, and even
misleading to those who
purchase it.
However, this year the
situation is somewhat
different. In the past, each
copy has cost 20-24p to
produce, and had very little
advertising to offset this high
cost. This is basically due to
the lack of effort put in by
some past Editors and
Advertising Managers. They
have used the same printer
year after year and not
worked hard enough at the
acquisition of advertising. By
changing to a provincial
printer (who charge much
lower rates than London
printers), I have manged to
reduce the cost per copy to
13.2p. In addition, around
eight pages out of 48 will
carry advertising which is not
an excessive loss of space for
jokes, and which will reduce
the cost further to around 10p
a copy—the price a lot of
establishments pay for their
flimsy covered bog roll type
productions. In this way, I
have maintained the excellent
quality , doubled the print run
for a price which is less than
that of our last production
two years ago.
I did wish to print 15,000
this year, since around 8,000
were sold on the RCSU Rag
Tours this year, and given an
annual sales of around 4,000
in College, plus afternoon
trips to to other London
Colleges, this figure is
perfectly reasonable if the
tours are repeated.
However, the Rag
Committee has limited me to
10,000 with a further 5,000
option, which fortunately does
not affect the printing cost to
any significant extent. I am
confident though that we will
easily be able to sell 15,000
next year, and if we do, we
shall make £4-4,500 profit out
of them. A situation vastly
better than in the last few
years.
I would like to add one
more, happier point. Next
years Rag Mag, whicn will be
available from the start of
term, carries an advertisement
for a FREE half-pint of Firkin
Beer at any Bruce's Brewery
| during Rag Week in
November— so have a free
beer on the Rag Mag ?nd
enjoy yourselves readirg your
copy!

Dear Sir,
To have a letter in the
; columns of The Times is
frequently felt to be the duty
of the distinguished; it is ever
the ambition of the obscure.
I wonder into which
category Mr David Rowe (The
Times 8.7.85) would put
himself.
/ remain, Sir, your obedient
servant,
Sir Choleric Splutter, Bart.
Dear Sir,
It has recently been brought
to my attention that the son of
a certain former Nazi leader
has infiltrated in to the
hierarchy of Imperial College
Union. I have reason to
believe that he is a new breed
of Aryan, known now as
Hairyun. He is short, rotund
and has a thin black
moustache and goes under
the obviously pseudonymical
appellation of Quentin
Fontana. I am at this time
unable to eleborate further on
the proof of this statement as
I am currently in fear for my
life from his infamous 'hit
squad'.
Yours in hiding,
Arnold Swharzberg
•Quentin Fontana: Adolf
Hitler in disguise
Dear Sir,
It has come to my attention
recently that various
prominant members of IC
Union have been doubting my
cliam to be of Italian orgin.
Suggestions have been made
that my ancestory is in fact
Austrian being of decent,
through an illegitimate line, of
an Austrian army corporal
who used his rank as a
stepping stone to become
leader of the German National
Socialists Party. I refute this
allegation and strongly deny
that my purpose in becoming
ICU Hon Sec was to take a
step nearer my ultimate
ambition of world rule by the
master race of Boris Becker
although that glorious day is
now nearer with that great
triumph only a few days old.
I must stress that my
surname of Fontana is
Genuine Italian and is not
derived from Von Taner as
has been suggested.
Yours in rage,
Quentin Fontana
ICU Hon Sec
Apathetic PGs
Dear Sir,
I was delighted to see in the
last issue of FELIX the offer of
regular postgraduate issjes,
subject to adequate help
being forthcoming from the
postgraduates at College.
Imagine how disheartened I
vvds when I learnt from you
that no postgraduates not
currently involved had offered
to h ,p produce these issues
and you therefore felt that,
owing to lack of staff and an
apparent lack of enthusiasm
on the part of the Summer
readership, you would be
unable to carry your offer
through.
So come on all you
postgraduates out there, you
complain that the Union does
nothing for you, but its hardly
surprising is it when the only
response to one of the best
offers made by FELIX in
recent years to postgraduates
is met by a deafening silence?
Show the Union that it is
worth maintaining the
Postgraduate Group, show
the Union that you care about
something other than your
work by coming forward and
giving up a lunchtime or part
of an evening to assisting on
FELIX.
For if not one of you can be
bothered to help, then you
have only yourselves to thank
when, in time to come, the
Union (and maybe College)
devote their efforts towards
undergraduates and leave the
postgraduates to plough the
one furrow that they seem to
desire.
Yours faithfully,
Hugh Stiles
Chem Eng PG
Sir,
The news that you are to
bring out regular PG issues
during the summer is
appalling. Where on earth can
PGs find the time to write
letters?

Industrial Society
To many the Carl Burgess's
decision to stop recognising
Industrial Society as a Union
society must seem very petty.
Industrial Society are one of
the biggest societies in the
Union, they do organise
events suchs as the careers
fair that are of benefit and
create goodwill for Imperial
College Union.
If you join a society,
though, you expect the
money that you pay to join
the socieity to be properly
managed. The Union has a
duty to ensure that all clubs
do look after their money
properly. This means that it
has to impose financial
procedures on clubs so that it
can account for the money
the clubs spend. Industrial
Society claim that they need
special treatment. A large
number of clubs, societies etc
also have a large turnover
and/or need access to their
funds over the summer. They
cope with the Union's rules.
The Union has a duty to try
and get Industrial Society to
conform.
Industrial Society has been
under pressure for a long time
to close their bank accounts
and have been given plenty of
notice that if they didn't, they
would be disciplined. If
anything the Union waited for
too long before acting.
Hopefully, the Union's
action has brought home to
Industrial Society how
seriously the Union regards
their failure to follow correct
procedures. Now it is
important that Industrial
Society and Dave Kingston
sort out this situation as soon
as possible. It would be
ridiculous if such a large and
successful Society were to
close or remain separate from
the Union.
Postgraduates
In the last editorial there was
an appeal to postgraduates
for support so that FELIX
could come out ever two
weeks over the summer. Since
then I've been approached by
three or four PGs all of whom
currently are heavily involved
with FELIX or IC Union.
Postgraduates often complain
that the Union does little or
nothing for them. This may be
true, but can one blame the
Union if it gets the same sort
of support that FELIX does
when it attempts to work for
postgraduates. Why not drop
in the office and offer to help?
Why not come in and tell me
what you would like to see in
FELIX? I don't know what you
want. If I don't get some more
support, there won't be
regular issues of FELIX this
summer.
