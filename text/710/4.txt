Last Dragon
Cinemas All over
London
The Last Dragon is a modern
day fairy tale, set in urban
American. Leeroy, the hero, is
a black teenager whose
mentor is Bruce Lee, the star
of a series of awful Kung Fu
films. Leeroy trains in the
marital arts but has yet to find
The Master and attain the
Ultimate skill. The two villains
are Sho'nuff—mean and on
the streets, he too is adept at
Kung Fu—and Eddie, the king
of video emporiums. Eddie
wishes to have the videos
starring his
mistress—distinclty
remeniscent of Madonna's
recent offerings—broadcast
seventh Heavan, a video pop
channel hosted by Laura, the
damsel in distress.
The film follows familiar
themes—Leeroy rescues
Laura, engages the villains
and finally triumps; he is even
able to catch bullets between
his teeth! Such a plot is
hosted with pitfalls which the
Last Dragon successfully
avoids to produce an off beat
or amusing film. It is
unpretentious with realistic
fight sequences, good
scripting, an excellent set for
observed role-reversals—the
Chinese who think that they
are funking blacks from
Harlem, and Leeroy's father
owning a pizza parlour.
The film soundtrack, by
Motown artist such as Stevie
Wonder, Smokey Robinson
and DeBarge, provides a good
backdrop for a film which,
though not exceptional, is
well worth a visit.

Opera traditionally fuses
words and music together to
tell a story. The action on the
stage tends to be less
important then the music
Akhanaten by Phillip Glass
challenges these tradiations.
The music has very few
words, instead the chorus is
used as a extra instrument
harmonising rather then
singing particular words. The
action of the stage is an
essential part of the
production. Indeed without
the fascinating stage routines
the production would have
seemed boring. The music
tended to be repetitive and
low key. However, the music

A Taste of Water, (Der Smaak
Van Water), is one of those
irritatingly good foreign films
that make you wonder why
you bother with American and
British Cinema at all.
This Dutch film is directed
by Orlow Seunke and revolves
around a hardened social
worker, Hes, and his
relationship with a young
pshychotic girl, Anna, who for
the past two months has lived
inside a closet, (the only
sanctuary she has ever
known), after her parents
have committed suicide.
Reluctantly persuaded by a
younger colleague to make an
exceptional case of the girl,
his determination, in the face
of defeat, to communicate
with the girl gradually draws
him towards her, at the cost
of his job, reputation and
family life.
Hes is forced to heavily
question his r6le as a
counsellor and also his
gradually deteriorating
positon in life. 'There is a
person drowning in a pool',
his student tells him, 'you
jump in to save him, you do
not throw him sweets'. 'Yes,'
he replies, 'except that there
are 100 people in the pool.
Jump in and you drown also.
Making 101'. Alas, Hes is
crushed in precisely this way,
not only by opposition from
his bureaucratic colleagues,
but from his own desire to
isolate himself from them,
covering up his weakenesses
in the face of hostile
opposition.
The moving plot is
complemented by quite
stunning camera work. Close
shots are used heavily in the
beginning of the film to
accent its oppressive mood,
without obtruding the
sensitive and moving
direction.
