The Cabinet War Rooms are
the surviving and most
significant portion of the
underground accommodation
provided to protect Winston
Churchill and his War Cabinet
against air-raids during the
Second World War.
The rooms lie about 10 feet
below the ground in the
basement of the Government
Offices, Great George Street.
As soon as you enter you are
in the 1940s. Everything has a
Miss Haversham, cobwebbed
decay to it. Old ration books,
newspapers, Government
papers and ancient
telephones are everywhere to
be seen.
After viewing the Cabinet
Room itself, visitors ran see
the Transatlantic 1 elephoiie
Room where Churchill spoke
on a direct line to Mr
• The Cabinet Room
Roosevelt. The Scrambler, for
some reason, was located in
the basement of Selfridges.
The Map Room, famous from
many war-time films, is
another major attraction. It
was manned day and night
throughout the war, plotting
operations on every front. It is
seen today as it was left in
August 1945, when operations
ceased.
The many other rooms on
show are offices, clerks'
rooms and living quarters.
Churchill's own room is
shown, but he only slept the-e
three times. He did make
many of his war-time
broadcasts from here,
however.
Unfortunately recordings of
these broadcasts are played
continuously at full volume,
all round the war rooms.
While they were probably just
what was needed in the
1940s, Churchill's speeches
now seem embarrassingly
jingoistic.
But this is the only criticism
of an otherwise excellent
display. Well worth a visist.
Allow at least one hour.
