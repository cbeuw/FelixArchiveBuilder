Industrial Society, Imperial College Union's second largest society, were
effectively thrown out of the Union for two days this week. The decision was
made by ICU President, Carl Burgess and ICU Deputy President, Dave
Kingston after it was revealed that Industrial Society had not closed two bank
accounts the club holds. Mr Kingston reversed the decision on Wednesday
evening after a meeting with Dave Green, Industrial Society chairman.
Social Club Committee standing
orders state that 'Income from any
source must be payed to the Senior
Treasurer'. Former ICU Deputy
President Dave Parry wrote to
Industrial Society pointing this out to
Industrial Society. He warned that if
the accounts that the society hold,
which are't controlled by the Senior
Treasurer, weren't closed by 1st July
the Society might lose the privileges
associated with being an Imperial
College Union Society.
Mr Parry received no reply to his
letter although Industrial Society say
they attempted to organise at least
three meetings between themselves,
Mr Parry and Dr Nigel Graham, SCC
Senior Treasurer. On Monday
morning Mr Burgess and Mr
Kingston decided that Industrial
Sabbaticals
Pass
• The four sabbaticals: Over the
moon about their exam results
All four sabbaticals are of good
academic standing and are able to
take up their new posts. ICU
President, Carl Burgess, was
awarded a pass degree in Physics.
Deputy President, Dave Kingston,
was awarded a pass degree in
Mathematics. Honorary Secretary,
Quentin Fontana was awarded an
upper second class honours degree
in Metallury. Felix editor, Hugh
Southey was admitted to the fourth
year of his course in Chemical
Engineering.
Society would have to pay for the
use of rooms etc in the Union, would
be banned from using the Union
telephones and would have to pay
more for the printing of their
handbook, At a meeting on
Wednesday evening with Industrial
Society agreed in principle to the
closure of their bank accounts so the
decision was reversed.
Mr Kingston told FELIX that he
believed that it is in the interest of
club members that club accounts are
audited and controlled by a Senior
Treasurer. Mr Green, however,
argued that Industrial Society had to
be able to get access to their money
rapidly. He claimed that the Senior
Treasurer was often unavailable.
IC Smash UL
Imperial College won the Visitors'
Cup for coxless fours at Henley on
Sunday by beating a team
representing the University of
London easily in the final. The win
was Imperial College boat club's
fiftieth win this season.
In the semi-final Imperial, who
were represented by Kevin
Steinbeckner, Greg Harding, Andrew
Spalding and Guy Pooley beat the
much fancied Isis team. Isis, who
had several blues and junior
internationals in their team, got away
to a strong start. And had a big lead
at the halfway stage. However
consistant bursts from the IC team
payed off and IC took the lead. Isis
were disqualifieid when they steared
their boat into the Imperial boat
while behind.
The final resulted in a comfortable
win for Imperial, Imperial got away to
a good start and were three lengths
ahead within two mintues. They were
then able to control the rate.
Coach Bill Mason described the
result as tremendous. In his view the
win showed Imperial College had
one of the best five boat clubs in
Britain. Imperial last won at Henley
in 1978.
Mr Mason added that many of the
teams that Imperial were competing
against train full time and live at
Henley for the duration of the
competition. The Imperial team had
to travel from London every day.
The win was especially pleasing
for Greg Harding who was rowing
his last race for Imperial and is
getting married next weekend.

Cash for Prof Fersht
Professor Alan Fersht, of the
Chemistry Department, has received
a special equipment grant of
£440,000.
Fersht's group is the World's
foremost laboratory in the field of
protein engineering.
'Without this extra money we could
quickly have fallen behind,' said
Fersht. 'The equipment is absolutely
essential for us to make progress'.
The group was one of a handful to
receive a discretionary grant from
the Government—the main criteria
were that projects should be of
international standing and show
industrial promise.
Protein engineering involves re-
designing old enzymes and making
new ones. Hence their stability and
activity can be improved, making
them more useful in organic
synthesis.
Fersht intends to use the money to
buy a DNA synthesizer, a 500 MHz
nmr spectrometer, HPLC equipment
and other pieces of smaller
apparatus.
Another recipient of a
discretionary award was the new
rector, Dr Ash, who is currently Head
of Electrical Engineering at UCL.
