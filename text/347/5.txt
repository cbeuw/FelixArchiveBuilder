A.S.T.M.S: - Open Letter
Should the Personnel Secretary Resign?
There is an organisation existing
to w h i c h most Personnel Officers be-
long. This organisation aims to foster
high standards of integrity 'in that pro-
fession. It proclaims that the function
of a Personnel Officer is to honestly
attempt to solve industrial relations
problems, even if this involves dis-
agreeing with their employer.
Does M r . M a l o n e measure up to
these admirable standards?
It i s the view of t h e Branch C o m -
mittee that he does not.
The College brought h i m in to i m -
prove staff/Col lege relations, at least
that w a s What the former Rector said
at the time. T h e reverse has hap-
pened. Never has there been such a
bad a n d disgraceful situation as n o w
sxists.
NATIONAL A N D LOCAL
A G R E E M E N T S A R E BROKEN
The National Agreement requires
the post of Departmental Superinten-
dent to be part of the T e c h n i c a l Staff
structure, if t h e work done is the
same as the J o b Description in the
Blue Book. Everybody knows that that
is the case in this College, neverthe-
less the College will not c o m p l y with
this Agreement.
W e have a local agreement that a
special criteria s h o u l d be used to de-
cide whether Experimental Officers
should be regarded as A c a d e m i c or
T e c h n i c a l Staff. W e are sure that this
is being broken, a n d that some " b l u e
eyed b o y s " are being slipped through
as para-Academics, w h e n they do not
meet the criteria.
Every request by us to be able to
check what has happened has been
evaded.
There is a National Agreement
covering the w a y in w h i c h N o n U n i o n
people c a n appeal against their grad-
ings. This agreement involves our par-
ticipation in the Appeals Committee.
W e have n o w discovered that this is
also being secretly broken. N o n -
U n i o n Experimental Officers w h o h a d
been placed in the Technical Staff,
but believe that they should be ' A c a -
d e m i c s ' , are appearing before Special
A p p e a l s Committees, without either
our knowledge or agreement. Our pro-
tests have been ignored.
M o n t h s ago w e d i s c u s s e d with the
College a request by us for direct
A . S . T . M . S . representation on both the
Safety & Training Committee. W e
were p r o m i s e d an early reply. Not
only has there been no reply, but w e
k n o w that I.C. has since made a state-
ment to the University Safety Officers
Committee that there should be n o
U n i o n representation on a n y Safety
Committee.
In April last w e made proposals to
regrade a member of the Maintenance
staff w h o holds a responsible position.
It is our view that he should be
graded as a Maintenance Officer a n d
propertly paid. In fact he is under-
p a i d and graded as a Clerk. In the last
month w e have m a d e three requests
for a meeting to clear the matter u p ,
but have failed to get a meeting.
Similarly With the College Tele-
phone Engineers. Hitherto they have
been linked w i t h the T e c h n i c i a n s for
grading a n d pay. W i t h restructuring
what Will happen to them?
Repeated requests for a meeting
bring promises but no meeting.
A l l the above are but a selection of
the problems that w e have been u n -
able to solve. T h e most serious ques-
tion, however, is the totally unaccept-
able situation o n Restructuring of the
Technical Staff.
RESTRUCTURING A N D
REGRADING
There were 1 4 9 appeals b y U n i o n
m e m b e r s . 5 4 have been heard, leav-
ing 9 5 yet to be done. Every other
London College has finished the entire
procedure, local, Regional a n d
National level appeals. T h e absence of
any effort by the College to complete
the exercise i s due to an attitude of
contempt by them for the Technical
Staff.
Moreover, despite the fact that
in some departments, notably M e c h -
anical Engineering Department, the
exercise w a s carried out in the most
inefficient a n d biased manner, n o
attempt h a s been m a d e to rectify the
bad initial gradings. T h i s has resulted
in members being forced into the
Appeals machinery quite unneces-
sarily, a n d w i t h no guarantees of ob-
taining justice.
There has been extraordinary hap-
Denings affecting individuals, even i n -
cluding attempts at intimidation. T h e
case of our Branch C h a i r m a n , Arthur
Sier, being one of the worst. T h e Per-
sonnel Secretary told h i m quite
bluntly that if he put his o w n case to
appeal, then he w o u l d be made to re-
gret i t .
Needless to say T H O S E R E M A R K S
were made to the wrong a d d r e s s ! !
So, where d o w e G O ? C a n w e go
on like this?
A b o u t a year ago, all of the Unions
in the College met the College Secre-
tary to request changes in the attitude
of the Personnel Department. Pro-
mises were m a d e but things are n o w
worse than ever.
It is n o w becoming clear that nor-
mal negotiating channels are being
closed to us. T h i s w e will not tolerate.
There are other ways to get things
done a n d we must be prepared to use
them.
On behalf of the Branch Committee,

LETTER OF COMPLAINT
I a m writing to c o m -
plain, on behalf o f the
IC E c o - A c t i o n group a n d
of the 7 0 to 1 0 0 people
Who cycle to IC every
day, about the lack of
bicycle parking space.
A c c o r d i n g to l . C . U .
H o n . S e c . Paul W a d s -
worth, there are 8 7 b i -
cycle spaces at IC,
which might be sufficient
were it not for the
thoughtless motorcycl-
ists w h o block the b i -
cycle racks with their
machines. Motorbikes
have stands a n d the only
reason for parking in b i -
cycle spaces c o u l d be
for the shelter w h i c h
some of them afford.
M o s t bicycles do not
have stands a n d they
need a means of support:
the bicycle spaces. T h e
Maintenance department
have said that they w i l l
put up a notice telling
motorcyclists not to park
in the bicycle racks; w e
ask all motorcyclists to
observe this rule.
M r . W a d s w o r t h has
said that y o u cannot ex-
pect to have a bicycle
rack outside each depart-
ment, and that he cannot
justify expenditure o n
additional bicycle racks
unless the present ones
are filled a n d some b i -
cycles remain without
spaces. S o any cyclist
who wants more parking
space provided should
try to find space in a
rack, a n d park there.
W h i l e I have the op-
portunity, I shall point
out some ecological a d -
vantages of bicycles over
cars. Cars gulp petrol, a
limited a n d increasingly
scarce resource n o w that
the oil /energy crisis is
upon u s ; but bicycles J
don't waste fuel. B i c y c l - j
es generally last m u c h I
longer than cars (iron
ore is also limited re-
source). Cars spew out
stinking,choking exhaust
fumes w h i c h are a haz-
ard to health a n d to the
environment (the earth
is a refuse tip of limited
size). B i c y c l e s are n o n -
polluting. B i c y c l e s have
other advantages, too:
cycling is a good exer-
cise; b i c y c l e s c a n slip
through traffic queues,
and are easy (??) to
park. A n d here is one to
think about: more time
is lost by the many
people w h o make it pos-
sible for c a r drivers to
travel at high speeds,
than is gained by the
drivers in travelling at
these speeds.
Yours,
Adrian Robinson

The College is subject
to the emergency regula-
tions in force governing
the use of electricity for
display lighting and
space heating.
Should the situation
with regard to the sup-
ply of ELECTRICITY de-
teriorate and power cuts
are made, it may be ne-
cessary:—
(a) to take out of ser-
vice up to 60 per
cent of all LIFTS
not only as an elec-
tricity economy
measure but more
so to reduce the
possible number of
incidents of passen-
gers being trapped
to a degree that the
maintenance staff
can cope with;
(b) to require users of
large amounts of
power to restrict or
suspend the use of
heavy machines.
In the event of a loss
of OIL supplies it may be
necessary:—
(a) considerably to re-
duce the level of
space heating in the
evenings between 6
p.m. and 6 a.m.)
and all day on Sat-
urdays and Sun-
days;
(b) to restrict the sup-
ply of S T E A M to all
but essential users
(as defined in the
College emergency
procedure booklet).
mergency:-
Any departmtenal ar-
rangements that can be
made to economise in
the use of ELECTRICITY
and OIL should be
brought into effect. So
also with W A T E R , both
hot and cold, since an
economy here can have
a pronounced effect on
the amount of electricity
needed to drive the sew-
age and drainage pumps.
As matters of SAFETY
(a) candles should only
be used where au-
thorised at depart-
mental level (limit-
ed supplies are av-
ailable in the Col-
lege Main Store on
requisitions signed
by Assistant Direc-
tors, Wardens and
the Domestic Bur-
sar);
(b) emergency lighting
in buildings is to
help ensure swift
and safe evacuation
in an emergency
and is not for pro-
longed use in any
other situation.
INFORMATION on the
timing of any power cuts
(when known), oil sup-
ply shortfalls and any
other related items will
be passed to addresses
as Jhey occur under ar-
rangements made by the
Chief Maintenance Offi-
cer.
