One other extremely
important point is for
those students due to leave
College to be able to re-
cover their money and
pay it to the College, so
that they do not r u n the
risk of losing their de-
grees.
I recommend that this
paper be circulated to
H a l l and House Wardens
immediately. This is not
to present it as a discus-
sion point, but to reassure
Wardens that we are seri-
ous and that no element
of irresponsibility enters
the organisation of the
Rent Strike. This may be
necessary to forestall any
immediate opposition, and
prevent any lessening in
good relations between
students and Wardens.

thought; Article 10 —
freedom of expression;
Article 14 — freedom
from d i s c r i m i n a t i o n .
The N C C L accepts
that cases of this nature
frequently embarrass
Governments. Interna-
tional supervision of this
kind is bound to be un-
comfortable on occa-
sions. Yet it is precisely
this discomfort w h i c h
justifies the existence of
the right of individual
petition. Moreover, if
this right were allowed
to lapse, it w o u l d repre-
sent a blow not only to
the protection of h u m a n
rights in the United
K i n g d o m but w o u l d s i g -
nificantly undermine the
Convention in Europe as
a whole.
Y o u r organisation is
already playing a vital
role in the protection of
human rights. The N C C L
is making its own c o n -
tribution to the c a m -
paign but the true suc-
cess of this c a m p a i g n
depends on an emphatic
response f r o m organisa-
tions such as your o w n .
It i s important for the
Government to see that a
large number of agencies
and organisations care
about this issue.
W e are therefore ask-
ing y o u :
1. to make your org-
anisation's view known
by writing to the Prime
Minister a s k i n g that the
right of individual peti-
tion be renewed for an
indefinite period;
2. where appropriate,
to persuade your m e m -
bers to lobby their M P s
by seeking personal i n -
terviews i n their con-
stituencies;
3. to let the N C C L
k n o w any action you
have taken.
If you require any
further information or
material- please do not
hesitate to contact either
myself or, the N C C L ' s
L e g a l Officer, Larry
Grant.
Yours sincerely,
Martin Loney,
General Secretary.

M u c h of the latter
part of the lecture in-
volved the various tech-
niques no wat the dispo-
sal of analysts, some of
great elegance, others
by necessity crude.
These I shall not discuss
here as these methods
are not to be read in
abbreviated form by
someone inept in these
matters but s h o u l d be
devoured f r o m either the
original manuscript or
some suitable textbook.
Suffice it to say that sev-
eral methods were dis-
cussed, none to any
great depth.
Thus, to s u m m a r i s e , I
felt the slides, text, and
general presentation
came over very w e l l . M y
only complaint w o u l d be
that the demonstrations
were skated over too
quickly to serve m u c h
purpose.
Finally, for those w h o
indulge in the study of
the C l a s s i c s , here is a
mouth watering quote
from Prof. B r o w n . ' Y o u
might say VitruVius built
the most successful
igloos of h i s day'. There
is no answer to that!
Sir,
I have recently ob-
tained a c o p y of the.
G u i l d s Handbook ' S p a n -
ner'. There are one or
two points Which I w o u l d
like to explain to any
guildsburke Who is feel-
ing just a little confused
by this strange publica-
tion. Firstly, on page
22. It i s apparent that
M r . Osborne h a d been
frightened by a ghost,
immediately prior to hav-
ing h i s photo taken. I aim
told by w e l l informed
sources that Stewart
M o r r i s o n is part-time
chimney sweep.
On page 22 Charlie
Lewis can be seen show-
ing his true desire. R i d -
ing on the M a y o r of
M a i d e n h e a d ' s Parking
Space. O n page 10 w e
see Tariq attempting to
repent h i s sins by paying
homage to the R C S
U n i o n Office. Unfortun-
ately w e w o u l d n ' t let
h i m in until he h a d been
Rag C h a i r m a n for a year
as a pen nance. However
in v i e w of h i s c l a i m o n
page 11 that g u i l d s pro-
d u c e d several floats for
last year's Rag proces-
sion (well, if they d i d
then they must have gone
on some other Rag pro-
cession, because they
certainly d i d not appear
on ours!) I think w e
w o n ' t let h i m i n anyway.
Y o u may not think this
letter i s worth printing
A l i , but 1 think it w i l l be
an improvement on the
continual pro-left or pro-
right letters w h i c h seem
to be the present vogue.

C & G C A R N I V A L
Not having attended a C. & G . car-
nival before, I went to this year's hop-
ing that my deprivation of beauty
sleep would be well rewarded, which,
I'm happy to say it was. The night was
well organised, there was plenty of
room to move about and the stocks of
food and drink seemed to last quite well
too, even if they were a little expen-
sive. F o r those people so inclined there
was a disco i n operation every time I
went past, and I must admit I was quite
surprised that when I put my head
round the door, I could both see more
than the end of my nose, A N D hear
myself think.
The only thing that piqued me was
that when they started, at 9.30, after a
couple of D o n a l d D u c k and Pluto car-
toons, M i k e A b s o l a m and A c e were
both playing at the same time. H a v i n g
enjoyed M i k e A b s o l a m very m u c h last
term when he supported R o y B u c h a n -
nan, I made my way quickly to the
J . C . R . to grab a seat. F o r those of you
who missed him both times round, he
plays a very carefully worked out set,
which comes over as one entity. It links
up his satirical songs (mostly with re-
gards to sex, drugs and violence), sung
in a multitude of different voices, with
the adventures of the fictitious H i r o n i -
mous, both of which are served with a
liberal helping of puns, ranging from
corny to clever. The listener has to be
very sharp indeed to even catch most
of them, which may be the reason peo-
ple come to see h i m twice, though he
does play some very nice tunes as well.
I did sacrifice 10 minutes of his show
to see how A c e were doing in the Great
H a l l , and although it's difficult to form
a true impression i n so short a space
of time, they seemed to be - a straight
college rock band, and I enjoyed more
watching the M r . Gumbies lumbering
about not unlike hippos with bunions.
Bees M a k e Honey, a band who are
just beginning to be noticed, rushed
straight over from another gig, and
thus were inevitably late. They played
quite consistently throughout their set
of rhythm and blues with some very
nice flourishes on guitar. Frankie
Miller, their co-lead singer, is capable
of sounding similar to Joe Cocker, and
1 was disappointed that he wasn't more
to the fore. A l l the same, they went
down well, and came back for an
encore of rock and roll.
N o t long after, the Fairports came
on in the darkness, and started with a
quickie, followed by the traditional
" T h e Hens M a r c h Through The M i d -
den, A n d The F o u r Poster B e d " , the
first of many from the " R o s i e " album,
with Dave Swarbrick using his fiddle
to sound something like, I suppose, a
chicken.
" T o k i o " , one of their newer compo-
sitions and written (would you believe
it) i n Japan, featured some interplay of
fiddle and guitar, and was followed with
another i n the same vein, Swarbrick's
subtle side coming over strong.
After a few solo spots, of which I
liked best Jerry Donahue's clever piece
on the guitar, they followed with two
songs in which they could all have a go
at singing, Trevor Lucas's rich voice
easily distinguishable from the others.
They finished, as usual with some jigs
and reels.
To round the evening off I went to
see Callinan S l y m m , who played 12-
string and 6-string guitars, though they
seemed to be little different from those
you can find i n most folk-clubs up and
down the country, so I went home for
a cup of coffee and a game of bridge.

MARTIAN LANDING
ON REGENT ST!
In the " F e l i x " issue of November the 6th I defined
the Green-Red " R e v o l u t i o n " as the systematic sub-
stitution of man's abilities, senes a n d m e c h a n i s m s
by institutions, organisations, machine, or apparatus,
that led to the gradual atrophy of the formers a n d
a d d i c t i o n to or dependence on the latters with the
consequent control of human masses a n d finally
leading to some k i n d of enslavement.
1. Freedom to learn what, how, w h e n a n d Where
we in conjunction with society, decide to learn in
order to achieve the best for us and society, a n d
not the best w a y for institutions a n d vested inter-
ests, in the name of society, to make us " l e a r n "
what, when, h o w and where it is more convenient
for them.
2. Availability of means, aids, advice, guidance,
etc. to educate ourselves, and not institutions a n d
devices to " e d u c a t e " us.
3. Possibility of designing our own educational
resources or of choosing t h e m from the environ-
ment, a n d neither having to use resources " s p e c i -
a l l y " designed for our " l e a r n i n g " nor having to
face the unavailability of information due to indus-
trial or governmental monopoly or to its being
labelled " s e c r e t " .
4. Freedom to choose what to learn, a n d not con-
ditioned choice from among pre-packaged curricula,
controlled by institutionally stipulated degrees of
reward.
5. Free natural rewards from society, a n d not
institutional monopolies of boosted reward reserved
for the best consumers of institutional " e d u c a t i o n " .
6. To allow us and society to decide with pride
and responsibility w h e n , What and h o w m u c h w e
know, and not to force us to " r e c o g n i s e " when,
what and h o w m u c h w e know, by means of tests
and degrees, thus depriving us of capacity, pride
and responsibility.
7. To allow for non-monopolistic competition (or
co-existence) of institutional and non-institutional
education, and not to m o n o p o l i s e all certification
of privilege conferring degrees.
8. To allow different schools of thought, and not
compulsory schools of one official " t h o u g h t " .
9. To allow not only to be taught the " h i g h e s t "
values, but also to learn if they are really so high.
10. Freedom and encouragement to interpret e d u -
cational resources (books, lectures, data, etc.), a n d
not discouragement carried to the point of impossi-
bility, by means of exams demanding s o m e degree
of agreement, b y imposing certain tasks to be ac-
c o m p l i s h e d , in a given time.
11. Freedom to learn the basics of our present
and future w o r l d or society so as to recognise the
basic problems and try to correct them, a n d not
simply teaching us to provide temporary " c u r e s "
for the symptoms of these problems by means of
devices, techniques, or counter institutions that
not only h i d e the basic problems, but also aggra-
vate the situations or s i m p l y let the problems grow.
12. Learning to shape society and our institu-
tions, arid not letting " o u r " institutions shape us,
in the name of society.
13. Freedom to take up careers to achieve re-
sponsible social activity With tools, a n d not careers
that take our responsibility away from us and use
us as tools.
14. Freedom to pursue science and technology
for the people to use it, and not to use people for
the pursuance of " s c i e n c e " a n d " t e c h n o l o g y " .
