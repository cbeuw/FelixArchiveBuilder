NUCLEAR E N E R G Y -
H O P E OR HAZARD ?
A one-day conference
to discuss the pro's a n d
con's of nuclear power
w i l l be held a t l . C . this
c o m i n g Saturday.
The growing recogni-
tion of t h e existence of
some degree o f " E n e r g y
C r i s i s " a n d the w i s h t o
conserve fossil fuels for
uses other than power
production {e.g. c h e m i -
cal manufacture) has l e d
to arguments over t h e
various possible replace-
ments of the present
sources of energy, coal
and oil.
Nuclear energy seems
to be a clear favourite in
many Western countries,
including the U.K., a n d
is, of course, already be-
ing used o n a s m a l l
scale.
Before w e cover the
country w i t h nuclear
reactors though, w e
should consider t h e t o -
taly new set of problems
w e w o u l d face. Techno-
logical failures, earth-
quakes and other unfor-
seen natural disasters,
and h u m a n actions vary-
ing from carelessness to
deliberate sabotage have
particularly serious i m -
plications With nuclear
power systems.
A s far as t h e p o s s i -
bility a n d magnitude of
major accidents involv-
ing the release of fission
products to t h e atmos-
phere, this seems t o vary
with t h e different types
of reactor.
Those of you who s a w
the " C o n t r o v e r s y " pro-
gramme on nuclear pow-
er a couple of months
ago will have heard O r .

the right o f individuals
t G petition the European
C o m m i s s i o n of H u m a n
Rights, c o n c e d e d b y
H . M . Government in
1966, comes to an e n d .
The Government has not
c o m m i t t e d itself t o re-
newing this right. A s re-
cently as 24th October
1 9 7 3 , the Under Secre-
tary of State for Foreign
and C o m m o n w e a l t h Af-
fairs, M r . Anthony Royle,
refused to state the Gov-
ernment's intention, des-
pite a series of questions
in the House of C o m -
mons from M r . Fred
Willey, M r . D a v i d Steel
and S i r E l w y n Jones
emphasising the impor-
tance of renewal.
The N C C L is this week
I a u n oh ing a ca mpa i g n
to convince t h e Govern-
ment of the need to
renew the right of indi
vidua I petition for an
indefinite period. W e are
seeking your help as w e
are convinced that it is
that m a x i m u m fatalities
from a n accident at o n e
of the CO^-eoOled reac-
tors in use in Britain
w o u l d be in the h u n -
dreds, whereas Daniel
Ford ( U n i o n of C o n -
cerned Scientists in t h e
U.S.) quoted t h e U . S .
A t o m i c Energy C o m m i s -
sion's figure of tens of
thousands for their L W R
(Light Water Reactor).
N . B . this information
was classified by the
A . E . C . t o a v o i d s p o i l i n g
their P u b l i c Relations
image.
Substantial questions
have been a s k e d about
the safety of L W R s — i n
particular raising doubts
about t h e adequacy o f
the emergency core-
c o o l i n g system.
In 1 9 7 2 the W . Ger-
man government advis-
ory committee o n reac-
tor safety recommen-
d e d a moritorium o n the
licensing of L W R s in
Germany, pending fur-
ther investigation.
Britain is also con-
sidering whether to buy
L W R s . If there are
doubts about t h e safety
of present types of
reactor, it s e e m s neces-
sary that a lot more re-
search should be done
and many more facts b e
made p u b l i c before w e
either install h u n d r e d s of
L W R s or introduce the
next generation of reac-
tors, the fast'breeders.
S o far I've only refer-
red t o t h e dangers of
reactor accidents. W h a t
is frequently regarded as
the most serious d i s a d -
vantage of t h e nuclear
fission process is the
significant amount of
essential for every vol-
untary o r g a n ! s a tion,
pressure group and case-
work agency to make
k n o w n i t s views to the
Government.
It m a y b e useful if I
set out t h e b a c k g r o u n d
to t h e situation. T h e
United K i n g d o m Gov-
ernment ratified the
European H u m a n Rights
Convention in 1 9 5 1 . T h e
present parities to the
Convention W h o have
accepted Ithe right of
individual petition are
Ireland, Iceland, Nor-
way, S w e d e n , Denmark,
W e s t Germany, Austria,
Netherlands, B e l g i u m ,
Luxembourg. Italy h a s
announced her intention
to accept this right.
The importance of the
right for i n d i v i d u a l citi-
zens to seek redress
against breaches of the
convention c o m m i t t e d
by i t s o w n Government
cannot b e underestimat-
ed. It is probably the
most advanced form of
highly radioactive waste
products that have to be
isolated for possibly
thousands of years be-
fore they a r e safe. A t
present, h i g h - level
wastes are stored i n
tanks a n d already there
has been at least o n e
serious leakage in the
States.
Techniques such as
the glassification o f
wastes a n d storage i n
disused salt mines are
being researched, b u t
whatever is done there
will always be a need to
monitor the w a s t e s — u n -
less, of course, an out-
of-sight, out-of-mind
attitude is taken!
The transportation of
nuclear fuels t o a n d
from reactors constitutes
another potential hazard,
especially if the fuel
transported is P l u t o n i u m .
Plutonium is one o f t h e
most toxic substances
known to m a n ( U . S .
Federal health standards
limit human exposure to
a total body burden of
0.6 microgram). In a d d i -
tion, P l u t o n i u m ' s half-
life of 2 4 , 4 0 0 years
w o u l d mean that radio-
active contamination in
an area w o u l d be essen-
tially permanent. T h e
fact that it is quite pos-
sible to construct a
crude a t o m i c bomb w i t h
plutonium hi-jacked from
a shipment to a power
station is also worrying
a number of people.
Environmental con-
cerns over t h e nuclear
power programme are
concentrated o n the
aspects o f (a) the gen-
eral increase in the level
of b a c k g r o u n d radiation
human rights protection
in the w o r l d today.
iff the right of indivi-
dual petition w e r e n o t
renewed, n o citizen of
the United K i n g d o m
w o u l d b e able to take a
case before the European
C o m m i s s i o n . Indeed, the
European Convention on
Human Rights would b e
ineffective: for While t h e
Convention a n d its Pro-
tocols set out certain
basic rights a n d stand-
ards w h i c h each State
undertakes to practice,
the number of cases
brought b y o n e State
against another are f e w
and far between. T h e
sdle inter-State case pre-
sently before t h e Euro-
pean C o m m i s s i o n is that
brought b y Ireland ag-
ainst the United King-
d o m . T h i s i s only the
fourth inter-State case 'in
22 years.
The N C C L ' s view is
that at a t i m e w h e n Civil
liberties are in danger of
gradual erosion, n o a c -
tion should b e taken
Which w i t h d r a w s a n i m -
portant protection of
human rights.
Individual petitions
w h i c h t h e C o m m i s s i o n
have considered or are
considering reflect a
wide range of issues
alleging the denial of
human rights in t h e U n -
in t h e atmosphere, (b)
the enormous amount o f
waste heat that, in par-
ticular, the present fis-
sion reactors produce
and discharge, v i a their
c o o l i n g water into rivers
and lakes, a n d (c) t h e
fact that present reactors
use uranium inefficiently,
depleting w o r l d reserves
at a h i g h rate, a n d that
in the U.S., in order to
concentrate 2 3
^ U f o r n u -
clear fuels, a n increase
in the strip-mining of
coal has been needed to
provide power for the
gaseous diffusion plants.
R em ember i n g t h a t
there are other possible
sources of energy (e.g.
hydro-electric, solar and
geothermal), I think that
this conference w i l l not
only try to assess the
most expedient w a y of
" g o i n g N u c l e a r " but
also, I hope, w i l l c o n s i d -
er Whether the risks i n -
volved in any nuclear
programme c o u l d be too
high.
Whatever viewpoint
you hold on the pros-
pects of Nuclear Power,
this conference should
prove very interesting.

fessors T . Kibble and G .

Professor Brown's
Inaugural Lecture
A personal view
by Nigel Foster
There w a s a lot ofteChniques of o l d .
" e m i n e n c e " present in
M e c h . Eng. 2 2 0 on Tues-
day night. A s I arrived
shortly before 5.30 p.m.
to hear Prof B r o w n de-
liver h i s Inaugural Lec-
ture, I w a s struck by the
vast numbers of Profes-
sors, Doctors, Lecturers
and the like a s s e m b l e d
there, chatting to one
another in What I w o u l d
term a s a c a d e m i c jovi-
ality. It w a s largely this
quality of audience pres-
ent that l e d m e to con-
clude that this was to be
no ordinary lecture. It
was not.
Promptly at 5.30 p.m.
the learned speaker
strolled i n , a picture of
style and confidence. His
suit said it a l l ; excellent
right d o w n to the rose in
his buttonhole. Indeed,
such was h i s aplomb that
although I have been lec-
tured to b y the learned
professor on numerous
occasions, m y introduc-
tion to this performance
became a case of being
familiar with the speak-
er but unfamiliar w i t h
the atmosphere of the
o c c a s i o n .
M y early apprehen-
sions were soon put to
rest once h e began h i s
exposition. T h e sharp,
engaging style of speech
had not Changed, n o r
had his diction, clearly
to be h e a r d i n every part
of the theatre.
I should at this stage
mention the subject o n
w h i c h h e w a s lecturing.
Being a 'Structures Pro-
fessor' he chose to look
at 'Structural A n a l y s i s
and Structural Failure'.
If t h e title appears pro-
hibitive, t h e text w a s
not. He opened by giv-
ing a broad outline of
how the ' a n a l y s i s ' meth-
ods of today developed
from t h e 'trial and error'
This method w a s only
superseded once t h e i n -
vention of language h a d
b e c o m e popularized.
Surprisingly, he does not
c o n d e m n t h e 'trial a n d
error' technique. Indeed
his admiration for t h e
method i s quite appar-
ent in the case of its use
in nature b y such as the
thrush i n i t s nest build-
ing, or the beaver in its
d a m constructions.
That language was the
key, there appears to be
no doubt. O n c e know-
ledge was recorded, past
errors c o u l d be used
beneficially and mistakes
made by o n e generation
need no longer be re-
peated b y t h e next, i n -
deed once language w a s
born, there w a s no idea
of comparable magni-
tude required f r o m then
on for man to reach his
present state of exper-
tise in 'structural analy-
sis'.
It w a s after this h i s -
torical d i s c u s s i o n that he
moved o n to a most i n -
teresting subject, o n e I
w o u l d describe a s
'Beauty A n a l y s i s ' . In
this he posed t h e ques-
tion ' W h y is it that one
can build Salisbury
Cathedral without the
benefit o f Structural
A n a l y s i s , a n d yet it re-
quires a century o r t w o
of research and an elec-
tronic computer to build
a multi-storey car p a r k ? '
The most cogent reason
he gave was that where-
as structural analysis
may make a structure
safe, ' i t w i l l not make
them ugly either' b u t in
too many cases this side
of affairs is a l l o w e d to
become subservient to
the more scientific struc-
tural analysis.
