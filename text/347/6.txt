LC. Golfing Society
In recent years t h e 1C
Golfing Society h a s be-
c o m e something of a
run-down organisation.
T h i s decline h a s c o m e
about partly due to neg-
lect though perhaps a
more potent reason is
that golfers a r e unaware
of t h e very fortunate
position they occupy at
fC. Let m e illustrate this
by means of a c o m p a r i -
son. For a n entrance fee
of 9 0 p a n IC student
automatically becomes a
member of Royal M i d -
Surrey Golf Club, a club
w i d e l y regarded as being
amongst the best i n
Southern England. F o r
every round h e plays
there h e is charged 2 8 p
(a f e e w e are hoping the
U n i o n Will cover). F o r
the rest of the w o r l d
there is the problem of
first getting one's name
on to a four year waiting
list (a list w h i c h cannot
be avoided unless one
has first obtained a
Knighthood, a title quite
hard t o c o m e by nowa-
days, particularly a s a
student). O n c e o n e h a s
found a w a y o n to this
list and waited four years
there i s then an entrance
fee of roughly £250 to
pay w i t h a n annual sub-
scription of about £100
lumped o n t o p of that.
After all this palaver one
is then admitted into the
ranks o f members a n d
permitted to u s e the
course. T h u s , w h i l e t h e
IC student merely pays
his 9 0 p and w a l k s o n to
the course, t h e poor o l d
'Rest of w o r l d ' has four
years a n d £350 to con-
tend w i t h before he c a n
even buy a golf b a l l .
The only limit to t h e
c l u b ' s generosity i s that
only 2 5 IC students are
permitted this five-star
treatment. A t present,
only 19 have done this
so there is still room for
six n e w members.
I s h o u l d also a d d that
this year w e are hoping
to extend our fixture list
and have matches every
W e d n e s d a y afternoon. 2

Match report—14th November
It w a s a confident IC
team that marched d o w n
to Royal M i d Surrey 'last
W e d n e s d a y . T h i s confid-
ence w a s b a s e d o n a
two-year unbeaten rec-
ord i n a l l matches, a
record s e c o n d t o none.
(The fact that w e have
not played a match for
two years should not de-
tract from this). T h e op-
position w a s a strong
U C team, fresh from a
convincing victory over
Po rts m 0 uth P o l y tech n i c,
a b i g name in golfing
c i r c l e s !
Promptly at 1 2 . 3 0
p.m., after a n excellent
lunch, the t w o teams
rolled out t o the first tee.
IC superstar Bill Calder-
w o o d drove off a m i d
great applause, h i s
brand-new ball flying
like a majestic eagle into
a nearby gorsebush. In
spite o f this minor a c c i -
dent, h e managed to
c l i m b into a c o m m a n d -
ing lead of three holes
after playing nine. After
this, however, things
d i d not go well f o r h i s
opponent began to play
spectacular golf, through
w h i c h h e managed to
take five of the next eight
holes t o c l i n c h a two and
one victory.
In the other matches,
Rick B r o w n , a player as
steady as his Land-Rover
might suggest, lost to an
opponent w h o p r o d u c e d
a round of 71 (one over
par t o golfing fans), a
score more attributable
to the likes of Tony J a c k -
lin than to a college stu-
dent. Chris W a d d i l u s e ,
a young player being
nurtured with a n eye to
the future, ate an extra
healthy lunch a n d h i s
subsequent h i c c u p s pre-
vented h i m from playing
to form. H i s defeat does
not represent a, victory
for U C s o m u c h as it
questions t h e quality of
the c l u b ' s sardine sand-
wiches.
Indeed, the lunch h a d
a very strong effect o n
this match result, tan
Reed's hard-boiled egg
c o u l d only sustain h i m
to the seventeenth a n d
his 1 d o w n defeat re-
flects t h e protein defic-
iency of battery hens'
eggs. Clive Pemberton,
unused to r a w onions,
decided to massacre h i s
opponent. This he duly
did (8 and 7 ) . For those
unfamiliar w i t h golfing
terminology this implies
that he w o n eight holes
out of the eleven h e had
to play. In h u m a n terms
this represents one very
drunk U C student,
clutching a tumbler o f
w h i s k y muttering ' M u m -
my!'. Rumour has it that
whereas h e used to des-
cribe golf a s h i s forte,
this forte is n o w trans-
ferred to cushion-stuf-
fing.
W e l l , I expect that b y
now you're w o n d e r i n g
What happened to t h e
captain. Surely h e didn't
fall into t h e sardine
s a n d w i c h trap, 'I hear you
cry. A c t u a l l y I d i d , even
swilling i t d o w n w i t h a
pint. Having said that,
I'm sure you can appre-
ciate w h y I w a s four
d o w n after seven holes.
However, once I h a d t h e
ball clearly in focus a n d
had removed m y oppon-
ent's glasses, I w a s back
in the m a t c h a n d after
some nail-biting scenes
tied the match at the last
hole.
Thus w e lost 4£-1£.
However, I'm sure y o u
w o u l d agree that w i t h a
g o o d dietician, this re-
sult might have been
s w u n g in our favour.
M y final thoughts o n
this matter a r e to c o m -
m e n d the spirit i n w h i c h
both teams played, a n d
to regret that o u r sole
spectator w a s o n l y cap-
able o f barking its sup-
port.

W a r d e n s for S t u d e n t flats
In the very near future
a warden w i l l be re-
quired for the student
flats i n Ravenscourt
Park. T h e j o b of this
warden will be very s i m -
ilar to that of the
wardens in student hou-
ses.
A n y interested, mar-
ried, post graduate stud-
ent should contact N o r m
Sayles (President) as
soon a s possible.
(N.B. F R E E large flat
within 3 0 minutes of
college!).

1 advise that one meeting of the Ten-
ants' Association to be held this term,
and that meetings be held every three
weeks, while o n Rent Strike. However,
all major decisions should be made by
referendum, which I would consider a
convenient, democratic a n d satisfying
process.
3. 'How do we control the funds" is
the other basic question. The " w h o
controls" part should be clear from
2.
It is important to satisfy individuals
that their money will be safe i n the
fund. I advise that:
i. 'ITie fund should be banked i n its
own deposit account: this allows
for speedy withdrawal or transfer
of individual students' money, if
this is necessary. Further, if the
interest rate continues to rise (and
the College has no legal claim to
the interest, though its ethical
claim m a y be reasonable) there is
the possibility of a "self-financing"
Campaign.
Payees should be given proper re-
ceipts for the full amount they pay
into the fund.
A n y payee should b^ free to trans-
fer his or her m r ^ w at any time
to the College A/c.
The terms of r^erer>.ce of the fund
should he such that under n o cir-
cumstances can ths memey paid in
by students he med fr
>r anv pur-
pose, other than payment of resi-
dence fees owed to the College or
for payments of refunds to stu-
dents who have p l a c H their money
in the fund. Cor»*'-ved on page 8
The Review
Book
I suppose i t h a d to
happen after t h e latest
barrage o f " G a y n e s s i s
g o o d for y o u " — Dave
Brandstetter, t h e homo-
sexual detective. A c t u -
ally h e ' s a n insurance
investigator a n d i s men-
tally prostrate over the
death of his long-stand-
ing boy-friend. When this
case conveniently comes
along to o c c u p y h i m
w i t h detection a n d n e w
friends.
T h e tale is t h e usual
sort of story, beginning
w i t h t h e local radio
h e r o ' s convertible
s m a s h e d u p in a flooded
creek. Everyone thinks
he's dead . . . except our
Davie, w h o exposes a
very credible trail of
small t o w n deceit a n d
crime. F r o m this point of
view the story i s a really
well-told unoovering-
pursuit in t h e c l a s s i c
sense; t h e dialogue is
crisply handled a n d t h e
narrative hangs together.
Unfortunately Hansen
either cannot handle
emotion, o r has t r i e d to
put t o o m u c h of a mes-
sage into t h e book: o u r
agents' affairs a n d heart-
searching are d u l l a n d
cloying, a n d spoil what
w o u l d otherwise be a n
enjoyable mystery story.
