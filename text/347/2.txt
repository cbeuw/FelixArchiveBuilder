Pitiful
Sir,
Have pity on the poor
Church Commissioners,
what can they do to be
right? If they don't im-
prove their property they
are accused of being
slum landlords; if they
a c c u s e d of being ruth-
less developers; if they
sold it a l l and invested
the proceeds they would
be called filthy capital-
ists; a n d lif they gave all
the money away there
w o u l d be a triumphant
crowing that this proved
the C h u r c h couldn't cope
with the realities of mod-
ern life.
Fortunately the C h u r c h
C o m m i s s i o n e r s are de-
termined to pursue their
their policy of providing
decent a c c o m m o d a t i o n
for a l l sections o f t h e
community, a n d a r e not
going to b e deflected by
the kind of attack y o u
published a w e e k ago.
It is worth investigat-
ing the case of 3 8 a n d
40 Formosa Street in
some detail, because it
shows the difficulties
that mindless militancy
puts in the w a y of people
w h o are trying to oper-
ate a responsible hous-
ing policy in the area.
First, t h e original ten-
ants have all been re-
housed b y the C h u r c h
C o m m i s s i o n e r s or offer-
ed comparable alterna-
tive a c c o m m o d a t i o n .
The present occupants
of the houses are squat-
ters Who m o v e d in In
September a n d a r e pre-
venting the conversion
of three large o l d hous-
es into ten flats for fam-
ilies living in sub-stand-
ard a c c o m m o d a t i o n in
the area. A typical rent
for a 2 bedroomed self-
contained flat after the
conversion w o u l d b e £9
per w e e k — h a r d l y extor-
tionate b y London stand-
ards. If even this rent is
too high for some lower
income families they c a n
of course obtain a sub-
stantial rent rebate from
the local c o u n c i l .
The Church C o m m i s -
sioners have met repre-
sentatives of the F o r m -
osa Street squatters to
explain the situation to
them, a n d have made a n
approach on their behalf
to the Westminster City
C o u n c i l to try a n d help
them find their o w n
housing. What the C o m -
missioners cannot accept
is that, young, single,
active people should just
move in a n d take over
a c c o m m o d a t i o n earmark-
ed for l o c a l families in
need o f decent h o m e s .
The situation at 3 5 B
Shir land Road i s even
more disturbing. Here
the C o m m i s s i o n e r s h a d
renovated a flat for a n
8 0 year o l d pensioner
(rent £6 p e r week, less
rent rebate). A week b e -
fore s h e w a s d u e to
m o v e in the flat w a s
broken into a n d taken
over by t w o or three
young m e n from over-
seas. I a m not at a l l
nationalistic—'but I d o
not see b y what right
young m e n from H o l l a n d
and A m e r i c a c o m e here
and appropriate for
themselves a n o l d lady's
flat-—and then a s k o u r
sympathy for doing s o .
The Church C o m m i s -
sioners control about
6,000 flats, houses, a n d
other rented a c c o m m o -
dation in London. Persu-
ing their policy of pro-
viding housing for a l l
sections o f t h e c o m m u n -
ity three quarters of this
a c c o m m o d a t i o n is let for
rents o f less than £10
per week, half of it for
less than £5 per week.
In recent years the
Church h a s housed doz-
ens of I.C. students i n
Six short 'life houses
Which w e r e made avail-
able completely free of
charge.
If the anti-God squad
were not so b l i n d e d by
ideological spleen they
might see that the best
way to help the home-
less w o u l d b e to stop
hindering the renovation
of ageing property in In-
ner London.
M y s u s p i c i o n , o n the
evidence before m e , is
that they are not so i n -
terested i n ithe plight of
the homeless a s they are
in delivering deceitful
and m a l i c i o u s attacks o n
those w h o are grappling
with the problem, while
grabbing free a c c o m m o -
dation for themselves.
Yours sincerely,
David Ashforth,
Chaplain.
Ed's note: the article
was reprinted from an
issue of E.A.S.Y., a
weekly squatters paper
and as such did not re-
flect my views but the
views of those people in
the college associated
with E.A.S.Y. Any reply
on this question would
be welcomed.
Maoist?
Sir,
I w i s h first of a l l to
make it clear that I a m
not connected with a n y
political organisation i n
England a n d have heard
about Gerry Healy a n d
about a n y matters re-
garding internal struct-
ure of S L L only through
an organisation called
C o m m u n i s t Federation
of, Britain. I a m not par-
ticularly well acquainted
with revolutionary poli-
tics in England, not hav-
ing lived here very long,
therefore I do not w i s h
to say What my o w n poli-
tical position i s as re-
gards this country.
However, being a sup-
porter of a political
group is not a prerequi-
site for criticising some
of the nonsense I have
read i n your editorials,
w h i c h is the basis o n
w h i c h I first wrote to
Felix. It w a s not origin-
ally m y intention to take
part in a detailed theor-
etical d i s c u s s i o n — P e l ix
is not the place for this
— o n l y to point out the
most blatant contradic-
tions in your statements.
However to continue,
since w e have got sO far:
so y o u admit (at last)
that the labour party can-
not/will not introduce
a socialist programme
and y o u are supporting
the labour party o n l y to
prove t h i s — " t o break
the w o r k i n g class from
r e f o r m i s m " . Firstly, ev-
eryone knows, including
the labour party itself,
that the w o r k i n g class is
not voting labour n o w .
Y o u only need to look
at the results of the last
four by-elections to see
what the people o f Brit-
ain think of the labour
party. Labour cannot
Win even in a w o r k i n g
class area like Glasgow.
However, recognising
this, the bourgeoisie are
trying to promote the
Liberal party. T h e point
is that exposing the lab-
our party does not auto-
matically " b r e a k the
class from r e f o r m i s m " .
In fact, in the absence of
revolutionary politics, it
leaves the w o r k i n g class
in a n ideological v a c u u m
conclusive to the spread
of fascist ideology as a
" s o l u t i o n " .
However you recog-
nise the need for a revo-
lutionary party to lead
the w o r k i n g class. B u t
to call yourselves the
revolutionary party is not
enough; a party is only
revolutionary if it has a
revolutionary political
line. T h i s the W o r k e r s '
Revolutionary Party does
not have; as far a s I c a n
make out, your political
line seems to consist o n -
ly of electing a labour
government pledged to
socialist policies.
Contrary to raising the
political level of the
working class, this actu-
ally lowers it since the
w o r k i n g class h a s a l -
ready rejected labour.
The role of a revolution-
ary party must surely be
to fill the ideological
v a c u u m created b y this
rejection of the labour
party by spreading revo-
lutionary ideology, i.e.
the realization that it is
not just a question of
fighting t h e Tories or
labour but of overthrow-
ing the capitalist system
itself, a n d to provide the
leadership for this strug-
gle. This I have never
heard from Y S S S , S L L ,
W . R . P . e t c . — i n fact y o u
have been very reluctant
even to admit that y o u
do not believe the lab-
our party c a n establish
s o c i a l i s m . Even if I do
not know w h i c h organis-
ation here h a s the cor-
rect political line for
Britain, I c a n tell it is
most certainly not the
W . R . P .
Yours sincerely,
Kathleen Corcoran
S' Side Bar
Sir,
W i t h reference to an
unpleasant incident in
South Side Bar on Thurs-
day, 8 t h November,
1 9 7 3 . I w o u l d like to
make a protest against
the behaviour of certain
I.C. C l u b s during their
initiation of n e w m e m -
bers. This behaviour
could be prevented b y
greater supervision by
l . C . U . , e.g. " D u t y Offic-
e r s " . This supervision
should be extended to
various constituent C o l -
lege a n d Departmental
pub crawls, etc.
This has been brought
to m y attention by vari-
ous regular student cus-
tomers w h o object to
such behaviour i n certain
College bars. I enclose
a c o p y of rules a n d regu-
lations pertaining to
'Duty Officer" supervis-
i o n . A cursory examina-
tion of the " D u t y Offi-
c e r " book i n Southside
shows a dramatic fall-off
in " D u t y Officers" dele-
gated since 1 9 7 0 . C o m -
pare almost o n e per
night i n 1 9 7 0 w i t h only
two in the w h o l e of
1 9 7 1 , complete absence
in 1 9 7 2 a n d only three
so far in 1 9 7 3 . I trust
that y o u w i l l back m e up
in the encouragement of
these rules, a s has been
done in t h e past, in the
hope that previous stan-
dards c a n be maintained
by your support in the
re-establishment of the
post of Duty Officer.
This is m y first letter
of protest since c o m i n g
to this College, almost
nine years ago, b u t I
think that behaviour like
this s h o u l d be c h e c k e d
before further incidents
of this nature occur.
Yours faithfully,
Stan,
Southside Bar.
R.C.C. TRANSPORT
A s R . C . C . Transport
booking officer this year
I have many people com-
ing to book vehicles with-
out m u c h idea of what
R.C.C. Transport is. T o
save me ten minutes Of
explanation each time I
wiM try to briefly explain
the booking system.
Bookings:
R.C.C. Transport is
mainly for the use of a few
priority clubs, since they
use ithe vehicles more regu-
larly than anybody else,
and also supply people to
run them. These clubs
however only have priority
for booking their particu-
lar vehicle, provided that
they book more than three
weeks i n advance. Other
clubs are able to book i n
advance but confirmation
will not be given until less
than three weeks before
the required date. A t the
moment we have a fifth
vehicle which is not avail-
able to the priority clubs,
unless it has not been
booked by anybody else
three days before they re-
quire it. Provisional book-
ing forms are available
from me i n Selkirk 488, or
from P a m the union re-
ceptionist. The form must
be completed fully, and
returned to me via the
union letter rack.
The vehicles owned and
run by R.C.C. Transport
at present are:
17 Seater Crewbus: Pri-
ority, Mountaineering
and Caving Clubs.
12 Seater Minibus: Pri-
ority: Y . H . A . and Scout
and Guide Clubs.
U.W. C l u b V a n : Prior-
ity: U . W . Surf and
Canoe Clubs.
I.C.C.A.G. V a n : Prior-
ity: Community Action
Group.
Spare V a n : Priority:
A n y other club and pri-
vate users.
Use of R . C . C . vehicles:
A l l drivers must be ap-
proved by the Transport
Sub-Committee before be-
ing allowed to use any of
the vehicles. F o r confirm-
ed bookings, the vehicle
keys will be left with the
Southside Messenger, i n a n
envelope addressed to the
driver(s), half a n hour be-
fore the time the vehicle
is due to be used.
The driver must also
produce his/her registra-
tion card before being a l -
lowed to take the keys
from the messenger. R e -
sponsibility for the condi-
tion of the vehicle a n d
accessories lies with the
driver, Who must fill i n the
relevant parts of the log-
sheet (one w i l l be enclosed
with keys), before taking
the vehicle from the car
park behind Linstead H a l l ,
and fill i n the rest of the
logsheet when returning
the vehicle. T h e logsheet,
keys a n d cheque for the
total bill (calculated on
the rear of the logsheet)
must be returned in a n
envelope to m e via the
Southside Messenger.
