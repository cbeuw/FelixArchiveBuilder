BROAD LEFT
JOURNAL
In J u n e this year the first Broad Left Student
Conference took place in Leeds Polytechnic. T h e
conference established the Broad Left Journal, t h e
first i s s u e o f w h i c h will b e available soon.
T h e B r o a d Left i s not a tightly knit party with a
m e m b e r s h i p and a manifesto. It is a group of stud-
ents spread a l l over the country w h o agree w i t h the
concept of a broadly^based left student movement
a n d w h o feel that such a m o v e m e n t i s worthy of
s o m e personal commitment, a n d that the journal is
intended a s a forum for d i s c u s s i o n , on w h i c h to base
a left student movement Which is both self critical
and rooted in a fundamental unity of approach to
major problems.
A s a student organisation the Broad Left has a s
its p r i m e point of reference higher a n d further edu-
cation a n d N U S ' s role a s the major student organ-
isation w i t h i n i t . But it i s also a Left organisation
w h i c h m u s t relate i t s ideas a n d actions t o a far
wider range of issues.
The B r o a d Left i s founded in the belief that the
student m o v e m e n t m u s t b e a popular movement i n
Which t h e majority of students are actively a n d
critically involved. Despite the spectacular growth
of N U S a n d t h e s u c c e s s of its campaigns, i t i s
glaringly obvious that the mass of students d o not
regard themselves a s primarily political animals,
let alone activists. 'But it is equally obvious that the
majority of students are concerned with the quality
a n d purpose of their education, are concerned with
the quality of social and cultural life in our society,
and a r e concerned w i t h a great range of national
and international issues.
Ties With the Trade U n i o n movement need to be
strengthened, its Journal w i l l help t o provide the
links that w i l l integrate this variety of concerns
and dissatisfactions Which has made t h e student
movement a powerful force.
There are m a n y issues that the journal w i l l take
up. The implications o f the White Paper o n Educa-
tion s h o u l d be studied closely and exposed. T h e
campaign f o r a realistic and universal grant is not
/et w o n , the crisis in a c c o m m o d a t i o n is far from
aver.
Ties between the student movement a n d the
trade union m o v e m e n t need to be strengthened
further not only because as organisations w e repre-
sent two sections of the society opposed t o capital-
i s m but because w a g e labour is the destination of
nearly every student a n d , conversely education to
any level should b e t h e right o f every worker.
There needs t o b e more d i s c u s s i o n on the left about
developments i n m u s i c , literature, a n d t h e arts.
Similarly o u r reactions to the deterioration of the
environment need t o b e given m o r e expression.
Oppression of nations in the T h i r d W o r l d is tra-
ditionally a n area o f student concern. Broad Left
w i l l continue to publicise such oppression a n d
attempt t o actively involve students in ending it.
in Britain, harassment of minority groups a n d a
rapid erosion of our c i v i l liberties continues unabat-
e d . If t h e Journal is t o d o w h a t it sets out t o d o ,
highlight these many issues and activate the student
movement around left policies, it requires an active
support from those w h o are i n basic agreement
With the a i m s outlined here and a readership that is
ready t o make its o w n contribution t o the debate.
A B r o a d Left grouping at IC has already been
established and hopes t o h e l p i n development of
student consciousness- w i t h i n this the selling of the
Broad Left Journal w i l l be very important.
Copies of the Journal w i l l be available from M a r y

M a u r i c e in h i s letter last week t o Felix asks,
" w h a t are a person's basic r i g h t s ? " . H e then goes
on to ask o n what freedom is, specifically i n terms
of how It is applied i n practice in Eastern Europe
countries to minority groups, i n particular towards
religious groups.
A person's 'rights' depend o n a Whole series of
factors particularly h o w man ' b e n d s ' the laws of
nature to meet his o w n n e e d s — t h a t i s the m o d e of
production capitalism, feudalism or whatever: i.e.
under feudalism in Britain i t w a s t h e 'right' of
serfs to w o r k 3-4 days a week on their o w n plot of
land i n return for w o r k i n g the rest of the week o n
the landlord's. Under c a p i t a l i s m i n Britain for a
long period t h e w o r k e r h a d the 'right' to 'free'
collective bargaining w i t h his employer over wage
rates and working conditions. It i s recently that the
state has through t h e p a y laws and t h e industrial
relations act attempted to erode this 'right'. Under
f a s c i s m i n Germany in the 1 9 3 0 ' s workers h a d no
such rights. The conclusion must be that a person's
organising strength (in the case of the w o r k i n g class
the trade unions) against the organising strength of
the set of persons wanting to reduce the former's
rights (which w o u l d be the employees through the
use of the state machine i.e. the police force escort-
ing scabs across picket lines, the army sent i n to
strike break, and t h e l a w as With t h e pay l a w s ) .
Thus a person's rights fluctuate according to the
development of the c l a s s struggle s o there are no
basic rights. In a fascist society workers have no
rights a s a l l independent w o r k i n g class organisa-
tions are smashed and at the other end of the spec-
trum after a socialist revolution that is in a w o r k e r s '
state the bosses have no rights).
To clarify t h e confusing terms M a u r i c e used in
his letter, i t must be pointed out that Eastern Euro-
pean countries, Russia and China are not socialist.
They are dominated by bureaucracies w h i c h put
their own interests before the working c l a s s . But the
m o d e of production is different, that production i s
planned (what w o u l d be t h e basis o f a socialist
economy) as opposed t o production in capitalist
countries Which is geared round the market. Hence
in that sense the productive forces are progressive
(degenerate because an elite section of the working
class the bureaucracy has evolved w h i c h controls
the economy for its own interests). The degenerate
workers' states have o n the o n e hand s o m e of the
old contradictions of capitalism s u c h as t h e w a y
commodities are distributed through t h e market
w h i l s t o n t h e other h a n d production is plan-
ned according t o u s e value (often i n the inter-
ests of the bureaucracy) as opposed to production
for profit i n t h e West. Likewise the social contra-
dictions of the o l d m o d e of production (capitalist)
is reflected in t h e n e w (socialist), among them a
degree of repression of minority groups. W i t h i n
religious groups individuals should be allowed to
practise their own religion if they s o w i s h — B U T
religion is a private matter that is it should not b e
imposed o n people as happens through state i n -
stitutions such a s schools in capitalist countries.
Are Maurice and other members of God Soc.
serious about their concern of repression of minor-
ity groups?
HOCKEY
Imperial showed right from the start of this U L U
cup match against St. Barts Hosp. that they Were
the more skilful, m o r e ingenious and m o r e hard-
working team.
The team, including several U L players, soon
settled down and after a period of pressure on the
Barts' goal M i c k D o w n s s m a s h e d a well-hit cross
from J a g G a h i r past a stranded B a r t s ' goalkeeper.
Barts came out after half-time obviously after
the equaliser, but it never came because M i c k
D o w n s s m a s h e d another goal past t h e d r e a m i n g
Barts' goalkeeper after about five minutes of play.
Barts then threw everything they had at us, and
after soaking up continual pressure Barts managed
to break-us d o w n and they scored a g o o d goal.
Straight f r o m the bully Barts started the pressure
again but this time after a fine break from defence
Jag Gahir scored to make the final score 3-1 to
Imperial College.
The cup team was: M . D o w n s (capt.), J . Gahir,
D. Whittington, K. Boulton, R. Cameron, M . That-
cher, T . Hanson, A . B r o w n , K. Ross, D . H a n s o n ,
G. Popple.
On Sunday, 11th November IC played two teams
in the U L six-a-side tournament. The second VI were
eliminated but the 1st VI after one walkover and an
aasy g a m e against Westfield found themselves in the
quarter-finals. Here w e defeated U C 2 n d VI 2-0 and
went o n t o face U C Tst VI i n the semis. Unfortun-
ately w e w e n t d o w n 2-0 to w h a t turned out to be the
eventual winners, A . B .
If they are serious about defending a l l minority
groups except the capitalist class and 'its allies i n
both capitalist a n d degenerate w o r k e r s ' states
against repression then they w o u l d be prepared to
campaign on the o n e hand for s u c h i s s u e s as t h e
release of Ivan Dzyuba and V y a c h e s l o v C h o r n o u i l ,
two Ukranian socialists recently i m p r i s o n e d for
organising a socialist oppositional grouping in t h e
Soviet U n i o n ; o n the other hand for the removal o f
British military and e c o n o m i c oppression i n Ireland.
There s h o u l d b e a t least one issue w e ought t o
have c o m m o n agreement on, that is the fight against
f a s c i s m .
The National Front is a fascist organisation w h i c h
is using racism a s a pole of attraction for all kinds
of racist s c u m and see legislation like the immigra-
tion laws as a green light for the g o ahead for their
racist activity. N o t only does r a c i s m divide t h e
w o r k i n g class but it offers no solution t o the prob-
lems working people f a c e — s o a r i n g inflation, i n -
creasing repressive legislation, housing shortage,
etc. T h e reason w h y the fascist groups are b a c k e d
by b i g business i s that on the one hand they i n -
crease divisions within the working class and at the
same time are used a s the ' i l l e g a l ' a r m of the state
to s m a s h u p trade union meetings and •left w i n g
organisations. That is, What the police don't want t o
be seen openly doing, a group of private thugs c a n
do instead.
Today in Italy the MSI (a sister organisation of
the National Front) can muster a vote of 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0
whereas the C o m m u n i s t Party (CP) despite the fact
that it can get five times the M S I ' s vote i n elections
has to hold its meetings in hiding i n southern Italy,
where the M S I dominate, for fear of having their
meetings broken up, l i k e w i s e w i t h trade union meet-
ings. It i s precisely because the C P i n Italy today
like A l l e n d e in Chile, like the left groups in the 3 0 ' s
in Italy and Germany argued that the fascists m u s t
be stopped b y democratic means and not b y force
that f a s c i s m has been allowed to grow. It i s only in
countries like Britain and France in the 3 0 ' s where
sections of the organised w o r k i n g class broke u p
fascist meetings that they stopped its growth. T h e
lessons from history a r e clear that any rights w e
have, w e m u s t defend, that means ensuring " n o
platform for f a s c i s t s " . The National Front is a s yet
not a mass threat because it is still a relatively s m a l l
organisation (although gaining up to 2 0 per cent in
recent by-elections). It is B E C A U S E it is not a mass
organisation that it is possible to stop the National
Front by force. S h o u l d it become a mass organisa-
tion it w i l l be too late.
A t Imperial C o l l e g e that w o u l d mean that w e
would be opposed i n principle to the N F u s i n g
either Union or College facilities Which w o u l d i n -
clude opposing t h e sale of N F literature such a s
Spark in College o r U n i o n premises. N o one w h o
claims t o believe i n " f r e e d o m " , " b a s i c r i g h t s " , can
seriously argue for equal rights t o an organisation
Which once given w i l l attempt to destroy the " d e g -
ree of f r e e d o m " w e have at present. If those m e m -
bers of G o d Soc. are seriously concerned about
repression they w i l l support the mounting campaign
against the N F .

Some Collected Thoughts
It is, I consider, the moral duty of students to c o l -
lect money for charities. This is o n e o f t h e f e w
ways in w h i c h w e manage to perform some i m m e d -
iately useful function to society. If o n e concedes
that it is our duty When w e should examine our p o s i -
tion to find out What is our potential. It w o u l d b e
pot too difficult t o collect £150 every S a t u r d a y —
that's pure c o l l e c t i n g — s a y 2 4 weeks w o u l d give u s
£3,600—then a d d o n £900 from selling 1 0 , 0 0 0
rag mags, w o u l d give us £4,500, assume 2 4 w e e k s
of W e d n e s d a y afternoons at £100 and w e have an-
other £2,400 to give us a s u b total of £6,900.
N o w that is What I consider to be the reasonable
potential of South Kensington. However, w e have
a wider potential, we're a London Rag and as such
have a huge a u d i e n c e — w h i c h w e c o u l d exploit w i t h
benefit concerts. Both p o p and c l a s s i c a l .
N o w w e have the organisation to collect the
money in the constituent c o l l e g e s — a n excellent
competitive structure. It is however the duty of IC
to provide the organisation to 'inveigle money o u t
of the rest of them.
