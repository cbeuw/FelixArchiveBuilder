SUPPORT FROM UGM FOR
VICTIMISATION
A t the U G M last Thursday, a
motion proposed by J o h n East in sup-
port for a student member of the
Society for S o c i a l Responsibility in
S c i e n c e w h o Claimed victimisation by
M r . M e a c o c k after h a n d i n g out

careers lecture.
The b u m p h pointed out certain u n -
savoury aspects of R T Z ' s business
operations in South A f r i c a , Snow-
donia a n d Avonimouth.
T h e student concerned wishes to
remain anonymous.
Hope w a s expressed that further
I C S S R S bumph w o u l d be distributed
at careers lectures in the near future.
A speech against the motion c l a i m -

Eddie Fisher from N U P E spoke
about the c o m i n g N U P E stoppage on
M o n d a y w h e n the refectories w i l l
close at 5 p . m . N U P E has decided
Hhat a weekly Wage of £20.20 for 4 0
hours is too l o w for the work that is
done.
J o c k Veall proposed t h e setting up
of a committee of half N U P E mem-
bers a n d half students to consider
further proposals. T h e committee size
was agreed to be 12 a n d will include
the President Norman Sayles.
Stuart Paul, N U S Secretary, spoke
about the necessity for IC to stay
within N U S .
He argued that if anyone con-
sidered that money spent on N U S
c o u l d be better directed towards a
needy section of IC U n i o n , then I C U
should go for a higher p e r capita
grant as £11 per capita grant is one
of the lowest in the c o u n t r y " .
He advocated national action in

STATE OF EMERGENCY
A t midnight W e d n e s d a y 13th
November, the Government a s s u m e d
wide-ranging powers regarding the
supply of certain c o m m o d i t i e s in its
declaration of a state of emergency.
This h a d been prompted by a
heavy s l u m p on the Stock Exchange
particularly in the field of Gilt-edged
Securities w h i c h suffered their worst
day's trading since the second w o r l d
war.
The Financial T i m e s share index
plunged 1 7 . 4 points to 4 0 5 . 5 a n d on
Thursday fell to below 4 0 0 . A b o u t
£3,000m. w a s w i p e d off share values
Sn the last three days of last week.
Despite a statement in the S u n d a y
T i m e s of ten days ago saying that
the miners go s l o w w o u l d not have
any effect until Christmas, H o m e Sec-
retary Robert Carr said in Parliament
announcing the state of emergency:
" T h e Government consider that the
present situations in the coal a n d
electricity generating industries con-
stitute a threat to the essentials of
life of the community w h i c h i s suffi-
ciently serious to justify taking i m -
mediate emergency powers to main-
tain essential s e r v i c e s " .
However there is no doubt that the
crisis on the stock exchange w a s
sparked off by the announcement of a
record balance of payments deficit of
£298m. for October w h i c h prompted
severe and unexpected credit restric-
tions.
The Bank of England w i t h d r e w
£600m. from the banking system by
(increasing special deposits to 6 % of
'liabilities a n d raised the M i n i m u m
Lending Rate from 1 1 1 % to 1 3 % by-
passing the procedure by w h i c h the
M L R is determined by the average
weekly Treasury Bill Rate.
On Wednesday the two-tier system
for gold w a s scrapped in a W a s h i n g -
ton announcement w h i c h leaves only
•the free market price for the dollar
(about $ 9 5 for a fine ounce of gold).
The balance of trade deficit figure
does not take into account imports
not c h e c k e d at Heathrow due to a
strike of import-checking computer
operators.
Basically t h e emergency regulations
allow for the direction of ships, road
haulage, trains a n d passenger carry-
i n g vehicles t o . carry Whatever the
Government wants without regard to
licences, plating certificates or other
regulations bar certain aspects of
third party insurance.
A l s o electricity, gas, water a n d
sewage c a n be reallocated according
to the direction of the Government.
Land, buildings a n d ail transport
can be requisitioned at the request of
(the Government.
Perhaps the most important clause
is N u m b e r 3 2 Which makes interfer-
ence with essential services an act of
sabotage for w h i c h one c a n be fined
£100, jailed for 3 months or both.
This c a n apply to large sections of
the trade union movement should
they go on srike and, considering the
present state of the economy, will be
used in the near future With the most
violent results.

RENT STRIKE:
Aims, Structure, and
Consequences
P R E A M B L E
1 have been instructed by Council to
draft a Constitution for a Rent Strike
Fund. T o this end, I have examined
various aspects of the Rent Strike and
compiled the following short paper.
B A C K G R O U N D
Primarily, 'the Rent Strike proposed,
is a tactic within the Grants Campaign
and should be seen as such. U n t i l last
year, the tactic was used o n a local
level, i n pursuance of local objectives.
However, during '72-73 some 45 C o l -
leges, Universities and Polys went o n
Rent Strike, and it has n o w become
widely regarded as an effective tactic.
M u c h debate n o w centres around the
question of whether the Rent Strike
should now become a Nationally C o -
ordinated Tactic, or remain locally
rooted.
The major argument for the National
Rent Strike is that the start of such a
phase i n the campaign would encourage
many more Colleges to go o n Rent
Strike. T h e major argument against is
that the real work must be done by
local Student U n i o n Officers, anyway,
and no-one wants Ehdsleigh Street
sticking their noses i n . However,
nationally co-ordinated responses may
be necessary to face up to attacks b y
College Authorities.
AIMS
The m a i n a i m of the tactic is clearly
to highlight the inadequacy of the m a i n
rate. Rent Strike is not a n economic
weapon. Last year, £2m. i n toto was
withheld, a paltry sum b y national
standards.
Its value lies i n that it dramatises the
Campaign, and involves large numbers
of students. T h e Rent Strike must be
accompanied by a massive publicity
effort, both outside and inside Halls,
Houses, and College. If the tactic is to
be sustained, a very deep political
understanding b y the Rent Strikers
themselves of the tactic as part of the
Campaign is necessary.
L E G A L I T Y
It is quite clear that Rent Strike is a
political action a n d that it is quite i m -
possible to produce any justification for
this action. T h e two basic forms of
action open to the College are:
i Legal action through the courts,
ti Internal action, either as an ad-
ministrative decision or as part of
the disciplinary process.
O R G A N I S A T I O N
In considering the way the tactic is
to be organised I have tried to take into
account the experiences of past strikes
and apply the appropriate tactics to I C .
Three basic questions confronted me
in this section:
1. H o w much of the rent do we with-
hold?
2. H o w do we withhold it?
and
3. W h o controls the funds, and how?
1. T w o choices present themselves;
either we keep the whole lot or just
the difference1
(rent minus notional
element). A t I C , with relatively low
rents, it would seem that were we
to take the latter course, we might
be returning some money to the
College!
I think that the only course here,
is to withhold the whole fee.
2. This is a crucial question. Clearly,
the money cannot be under the i n -
dividual control of those withhold-
ing rent. This would
i. Deny an efficiently run, well-knit
" organisation, without anyone
knowing w h o has withheld rent.
ii. Open individual students to vic-
timisation by College Authori-
ties.
T w o other options are open:
(a) the collective control of the rent-
strikers.
(b) the control of the Union.
(b) may be the more immediately
attractive choice, as the U n i o n struc-
ture is probably capable of absorbing
the necessary changes and additions.
However, i n campaigning terms, it is
essential that the Rent Strikers feel
that their money is under their o w n
control, and separate from the U n i o n
Structure.
A t the present time it would seem
inadvisable to place the funds i n the
control of the U G M , Council, or U n i o n
Executive. I believe that it would be
far more appropriate to set up a Ten-
ants' Association, which would control
the funds directly. A l l residents i n H a l l
or House would be members automati-
cally.
The Tenants' Association would be
run by a Committee, elected by the
residents themselves, by ballot. E a c h
H a l l or House .would elect its o w n
reps.; but the number of reps, would be
allocated on a basis of, say, 1 for 50
residents.
The Committee would then elect its
own Chairman, Secretary, and Treasurer
and Assistant Treasurers (3 would be a
good number). These would be the
Officers of the Tenants' Association,
and Trustees (or bailees) of the Rent.
Fund. It might be advisable for the
Committee to liaise closely with the
Union Council, but the essential point
is that residents themselves be seen t o
be in control of the money.
It might be argued that this isolates
those on Rent Strike from other stu-
dents, not i n H a l l . However, this might
be said of the tactic itself, and also I
must emphasise that not many students
would wish their money to be under
the control of a U G M .
The U G M , however, might serve as a
forum for discussion between non-strik-
ers and strikers, a n d would always be
able to make recommendations to the
Committee o f the Tenants' Association.
It is suggested that the election of
this body proceed with a l l haste and
that its first taste, this term, be to work
o u t ' a Constitution for the Tenants'
Association, and have it approved by a
majority (2/3?) of its residents. Alterna-
tively, the proposals might be worked
out by someone from this Committee,
or from the U G M or Council, and be
presented to the residents.
