Opinion
Charles Brereton
As Deputy President, Chas has
taken responsibility for Academic
Affairs, Overseas Student Welfare,
financial estimates and overseeing
the work of the Finance Officer and
Union Manager i n areas of Bar,
Snack Bar, Union Building and
other trading outlets.
Regarding Academic Affairs, Chas
was supremely qualified having
been the Academic Affairs Officer
and involved in this area for three
years previously; even so he
appears to have been almost totally
ineffectual. It was hoped that by
splitting the sabbatical jobs and
reducing the amount of work to be
done by all of them it would allow
the sabs to succeed in a few areas
rather than dabble in a number.
Academic Affairs was an area which
desperately needed attention and in
which Chas could shine. A t the end
of last year a sabbatical passed Chas
the idea that students could be
made Â£55 better off by shuffling
term dates and suggested that Chas
looked into it. A few months later
and Chas has achieved nothing;
luckily Nigel took over the idea and
results are now being seen.
The College has laid down limits
for time-tabled hours of under-
graduate courses and although a
number of timetables which break
these limits have been submitted to
Chas nothing has been done.
One of the most important areas
in Academic Affairs concerns those
students w h o fail and w h y . M u c h
discussion has taken place on
College committees about this
matter, but no one has any facts to
go by. In last year's annual reports
Chas was passed responsibility for
running a non-graduate quest-
ionnaire, yet while Nigel has
managed to survey every College
student for Welfare, Chas has not
been able to track d o w n the few
who failed and I wonder if he would
know what to ask them if he d i d .
In the area of Overseas Students
Chas was passed responsibility for
the Third World First student
scholarship. A large amount of this
scholarship h a d already been
secured, but some crucial matters
needed work. Six months have
elapsed and Chas would appear to
have done nothing. We are now
reaching the stage where we may
lose the ground previously gained
and the programme instigation date
will definitely be put back, if it starts
'Chas Brereton: almost totally ineffectual?'
at all.
Whilst the rents in halls of
residence were being discussed at
an important U G M last term, it was
proposed and eventually passed
that Overseas Student fees should
subsidise Hall rents. This is quite
obviously discrimination against
Overseas Students, yet Chas
Brereton's voice was not heard on
the matter. The vote was won by
only one vote: Chas voted in favour
of the motion.
C h a s ' s w o r k i n the U n i o n
Building has been outstandingly bad
and I shall save much of it for other
articles, but it is exemplified by the
case of the Central Staircase toilets.
The toilets were large, underused
and men only, so an expensive
alteration programme, to split them
into men's and ladies' was started.
College pushed the work through at
the most difficult time of the year so
that the ladies' would be available
for Freshers' Week. H a v i n g
organised this with help from the
Union Manager, Chas failed to
notice a lack of towels, paper
dispensers or soap on either the
plans or the finished item: these
toilets were almost unusable at the
beginning of term and, despite
m a n y complaints, u n t i l
approximately two weeks ago.
In overviewing the work of the
Union Manager the D P must make
sure that the short term interests of
the student are balanced properly
against financial gain so that
students will benefit in the long
term. I woud suggest that up until
now Chas has failed in this aspect
for both the students and the Union,
but that's another story.
Finally, according to his job
description, Chas is responsible for
security; there has been a new
security lodge built in the foyer of
the Union Building to house a guard
promised by the College. That lodge
has been unfilled for three months
now and last week STOIC was
broken into at a cost of several
thousand pounds.
O n the other hand Chas was the
only sabbatical that worked over the
Christmas vacation, he took office
earlier than the other sabs and has
dedicated his year to the Union.
Chas is an extremely amicable and
friendly person when he is not on
his high horse about being D P and
I believe he still could do the job
well. In his first month or so in office
he worked alongside of me and I
found him an excellent Deputy
President. Chas does need guidance
(often away from games machines)
and advice; his fellow sabs do not
have the grounding in the necessary
areas to help h i m out at the
moment. Nigel Baker does not have
an understanding of balancing the
interests of the students, even if he
did run a bar, and Ian Morris has
never run a bar. A s a team they
could manage to fill in all their
inadequacies. It might mean
working after 5.30pm, even when
there are not meetings, or on
weekends, but it definitely means
working together, encouraging each
other and not saying 'that's his job,
he's to blame'.
. Sorry boys but it had to be said.

IPhoenix is the literary magazine of
Imperial College. It was founded in
1886 by H.G.Wells under the title
The Normal Schools Science Journal
and now stumbles into its 102nd
year with me as newly appointed
editor. After an experiment last year
with a smaller issue published every
term, it now returns to its original
format of a slim, glossy book
published once a year, which I hope
will appear during the summer
term. A s for contents, it's really
d o w n to y o u ; poems, prose,
photographs, drawings, serious or
not so, I am willing to accept
anything of what I consider a
literary nature. One hopes this will
be art in the broadest sense of the
word. Y o u have u p until Easter to
do something which you can send
in ( a n o n y m o u s l y or u n d e r a
pseudonym if you wish) via the
pigeonhole in the FELDC Office or to
me via Chem/Biochem 3 or Linstead
H a l l . If y o u want to discuss
something with me or perhaps are
more interested in the production
side of the magazine I would be only
too happy to talk to you, remember
you have nothing to lose.
