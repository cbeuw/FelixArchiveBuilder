Imagine standing alone o n West
34th Street i n d o w n t o w n
Manhatten, rucksack o n back,
overwhelmed by the humidity and
pace of the Big Apple, armed only
with $250 and a work visa. The
prospect of surviving for three
months i n this rat race looks bleak
and terrifying. Yet this is how I and
3,999 other British students began
what is probably the best experience
of our lifetimes.
As I sailed on the ferry towards
Martha's Vineyard Island, I really
began to feel the excitement in what
I was doing. There on the horizon
lay the silhouette of the Vineyard,
where a new job, a new home and
a whole new circle of friends was
waiting.
Three months earlier I h a d
secured a job i n a sandwich/ice
cream shop. When I walked in there
for the first time, I was surprised to
find the shop full of British students
also working there and after five
minutes I felt completely at home.
It is impossible to describe the
10V2 weeks I spent on the Island in
a few paragraphs. Students from
the whole of N e w England had
gone there to work for the summer,
and the atmosphere was incredible.
There were endless parties,
midnight swimming trips i n the
local lagoon; jeep rides around the
island; lying on the golden beaches
just became a daily duty. It seemed
as though I was making new friends
every day. American students are
social animals and quickly make you
feel as though you have known
them for years.
Half way through m y stay, I
changed jobs, not because I didn't
like the other one, but I wanted to
have a different atmosphere. M y
second job was in an amusement
arcade, and I was the only Brit
working there. It meant I really had
a taste of working in America.
The end of the American summer
is marked by Labor Day. The
summer work had dried up and it
was time for me to set out upon the â€¢
second half of my summer. I had
one month before I had to return to
England, so I bought a thirty day
Greyhound bus pass, and set out to
see America.
It is quite impossible to appreciate
the size of America when you live -
in England. Bus trips of fifteen
hours, which didn't seem to take
you any distance when you looked
at the map, became the norm. But
each journey was different and
never boring. The largest proportion
of the G r e y h o u n d ' s clientele
seemed to be British students, single
parent families and wierdos (the
latter being the biggest category).
I travelled 5,000 miles all together.
The highlight of the month was
Statue of Liberty
Grand Canyon
definitely the Grand Canyon. The
sheer proportions are beyond
imagination (one mile deep, four
miles wide at its narrowest point
and 217 miles long). The scenery is
breathtaking, no camera could ever
capture the beauty of the painted
rock set against a clear blue sky.
Another place which stands out in
my mind, almost as a complete
contrast, is Las Vegas. The sight of
rows and rows of middle aged
Americans hypnotically pumping
quarters into the slot machines is
both amusing and sad. The blinding
neon and glitzy casinos at nighttime
are replaced by tacky buildings with
overweight signs during the day.
During my last week I went up to
Canada, and got a small taste of this
huge country. The cities of Toronto
and Montreal are so vastly different
from their U S counterparts, that
they could be 1000 miles apart rather
than two hours drive. They are
clean, friendly and safe, and I left
with the feeling that I'd like to
spend a lot more time exploring the
rest of Canada in the future.
I would definitely recommend
everybody to go to America at least
once i n their l i v e s . B u t t h e
experience is greatly intensified by
staying out there for three months
working and is ideal for students. If
