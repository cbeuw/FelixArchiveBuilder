DAVE SMEDLEY
Office Smokescreen
D ave, being N e w s Editor, is an
excellent source of gossip. H e ' s
always ready to throw really wicked
(crucial, man!) pieces of sarcastic wit
into conversation.
He's also always prepared to
reminisce about the good old days
when he was Broadsheet Editor and
had to collate all night because no
one could be bothered to help... I
k n o w h o w he feels.
BILL GOODWIN
Beloved Leader
is FELIX editor: obvious by the
haggard, worried expression he
usually carries around with h i m
while trying to hold the office i n
some kind of order. Sometimes he
hides this expression under his
'lovely' hat, a n d gets pissed to
forget that FELIX exists.
If y o u need to find Bill, look for
someone w e a r i n g a hat a n d
swearing at the Union, Council,
UFC, Pub Board...
The people who make
by Steve Meyfroidt
WENDY KITE
Features Editor
W e n d y joined the FELIX at the
start of the year and has risen to the
exalted heights of Features Editor.
Just to make a change, she justifies
this position by being good at it; her
nice smile, sense of humour and
skill at making coffee are entirely
incedental.
STEVE MEYFROIDT
Wackiness Factor
Steve's function i n FELIX is not
clearly defined, which means that
he gets his nose into everything. H e
produces arty layouts, i n depth
articles and rude features about
other FELIX staff members. Cheers,
Steve, the cheque's i n the post. (I
didn't write this - Steve)
Liz WARREN
Business Manager
jLiz's official title is 'Business
Manager'. She hassles Bill all day
long, which is alright because he
enjoys it. L i z is the one w h o sends
out invoices and tries (desperately)
to make the books balance and ends
meet (that's enough cliches!).
Anyone know where we can find an
odd Â£5,000 for a n e w folding
machine?
DOUG KING
THE Photographer
Doug likes his cameras, he does.
I'm sure his conversations make
sense, but all this talk about f45 and
automatic shutter s p e e d
differentiation by a zoom lens heat-
sink selector makes no sense to me.
The staff would love to have a
serious talk with the person w h o
puts the psychedelic patches on his
jeans.
DEAN VAUGHAN
Litho Operator
Dean is the second permanent staff
member i n FELIX. A right-on rebel,
he'll talk politics all day if y o u let
him. H e also sings. Loudly. A n d
often.
ROB DAVISON
Office Poseur
. A p a r t from his official title, Rob
also acts as News Features Editor.
Starting on FELIX this year, Rob has
easily slipped into first place in the
fashion stakes with an undisputable
good taste i n cravats.
ANDY BANNISTER
Moral Support
A n d y ' s namesake gives support to
people going upstairs. A n d y gives
support to anyone i n the office. H e
writes occasional pieces and gives
invaluable help when bits of the
extremely dodgy FELIX equipment
falls apart. H e is also witty,
attractive and modest, and he didn't
write this bit, honest.
ROSE ATKINS
Typesetter Operator
Rose, a permanent staff member,
is human, a point y o u might be
doubting after looking at the 'photo.
