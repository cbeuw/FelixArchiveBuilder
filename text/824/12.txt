If you are bored or confused by
the rhetoric being blasted about on
student loans do not fear, this article
is designed to inform the majority
of students as to what is actually
happening in the campaign against
loans.
Firstly, a few questions have to be
answered, the most important being
will a campaign against loans
actually achieve anything? That is,
once the D E S and the Government
have set their minds on the idea is
there anything anyone can do to
stop them. Past cases show there is:
the best example being the
proposed changes in gun Laws after
the Micheal Ryan affair. All political
parties and 80% of the electorate
were behind the legislation. But
then the G u n Lobby stepped in in
what has become" one of the most
notorious bits of lobbying out: the
Government then dropped the bill.
The White paper on student loans
hardly has the same support to start
with.
Secondly, should we actually try
to block the white paper? Ignoring
the ideological arguments as to
whether or not the Government
ought to be committed to fully
f u n d i n g students i n higher
education or whether alternative
sources of funding should be found
for students, the figures behind the
white paper are based on averages.
The average student being male,
white, a n undergraduate at a
provincial university, whose parents
have c o m b i n e d earnings of
somewhere i n the region of £19000
and w h o gets £214 a year over and
above what he should do from his
parents. H e also spends £20.50 a
week rent (86/87 prices) and spends
the holidays at home. The average
student would not be too adversely
affected b y the proposals i n the
white paper except that they'll walk
out of higher education owing the
government around £1,600.
Of course if you're not the average
student (ie you're i n London, a
woman, a postgraduate, on a part-
time course or you receive n o
parental support) the chances are
you would be much worse off under
the proposed system. It has been
said that postgraduate grants will
not be frozen but postgrads will not
be entitled to any benefits which
sort of kicks part-time courses in the
goolies. Naturally I don't have to
point out that rents around South
Kensington are not £20.50 o n
average. From the paper that Ian
Morris presented to governing body
last month (which was based on the
Research Service L t d " U n d e r -
graduate Income and Expenditure
Survey", which is what the white
paper is based on) the average
London student would be £1,510
worse off(on top of what they would
owe the Government) at the end of
their course, ie with total debts of
more than £3,000 over and above
the normal figures now. If you went
to an institute outside London this
would be nearer £1,600 (90/91
levels).
Even if you think loans are the
best thing since sliced bread,
actually reading the white paper
shows it is a seriously flawed
document (irrespective of its
ideological basis) and should not be
presented to parliament, this is why
we should campaign against it.
What is being done:
What the Union is doing: A s has
already been mentioned our H o n
Sec has submitted a paper to
Governing Body about the London
factor, i n principal this will be
ratified when they have checked
that he is not a creative accountant.
A working party from Governing
body will then be set up to decide
IC policy o n the London factor
among other things. Otherwise the
Union is doing what it has been
mandated to: departments are being
polled o n the proposed half day
shutdown on the 19th. So far all
years polled have said yes to it
(Geologyl, Life Sci 1, Mech Eng 3
& 4, Elec Eng 3 & 4, C h e m Eng 4,
Maths 1, C h e m 1, Physics 3, D O C
2 as of 2 p m Tuesday). A l l
departments will have been polled
by W e d n e s d a y . A l s o o n the
Thursday of the 19th the RT. H o n .
Peter Brooke, M P for Westminster
S o u t h a n d C h a i r m a n of the
Conservative Party will come and..
give a short talk followed b y
questions on his views on loans.
This will be at 1pm and Union cards
will be needed for entrance.
A petition is being sent round and
should be with your Dep Reps (if
you haven't seen it please hassle
them). This will be handed into
Parliament on the afternoon of the
shutdown, so please sign it. Also if
you are concerned about the current
proposals (if yoii are a first year you
should be) write a letter to your own
M P or the DES and this can be
handed in at the same time (meet
Parliament Square 3pm).
O n the external front, U L U are
organising a march o n the 1st
February (the last d a y of
submissions o n the white paper)
which our exec are going on. The
march is from Finsbury Circus in the
City (Moorgate tube) to Shorditch
Park (the centre of the universe, but
the only route the police would
allow the march to go without
invoking the public order bill). A n d
if you're really keen w e need
stewards o n the day, see me if
you're interested. The N U S are
nationally organising a march on the
25th of February from Victoria to
Kennington Park where there will
be a 'festival' like at the end of the
anti apartheid march (I reckon we
ought to supply a beer tent). Co-
operation with the N U S is running
into problems (from their end, U L U
have also had some problems with
the N U S exec about the 1st of
February), so no more details are
known.
The N U S is also trying to organise
a national shutdown on the 16th of
February and are liasing with the
A U T , N U P E etc about it. O u r
participation i n this will probably be
decided at the U G M on the 31st.
Finally U L U are trying to come up
with possible alternative proposals
to increase access to higher
education, which the white paper
does not do. Of course if you get the
current m a x i m u m parental
contribution of £4,900 this probably
doesn't concern you.

OPERA
Alas Strauss
and Jones
O n Monday Griff Rhys Jones made
his debut with the Royal Opera at
Covent Garden Yes, y o u d i d
read it right....seriously!
In d i s t i n g u i s h e d operatic
company the irrepressible M r Jones
delighted a first night audience by
his recreation of the comic role of
Frosch, the jailer, in a production of
Johann Strauss' popular opera, 'Die
Fledermaus'. The role of Frosch (a
speaking only part, I should add!)
is traditionally taken by a comedian.
In England Clive Dunn, Arthur
English and even Frankie H o w e r d
have played the (usually drunken)
gaoler. However, i n this new,
English version, by writer John
Mortimer (of Rumpole fame), Frosch
stands on an island of disgruntled
and holier-than-thou sobriety in a
sea of champagne and high jinks.
This treatment worked well despite
obvious first night nerves and those
of us in the cheapest seats enjoyed
the jokes about our 'restricted view'
of the stage and the unscrupulous
C o v e n t G a r d e n ' C h a m p a g n e
pushers' charging £4 a glass and £25
a bottle.
Purist concerns that the Viennese
flavour would be lost i n a n all
E n g l i s h interpretation were
outweighed by some good one-
liners i n the new translation and
hilarious use of the controversial
subtitles when two imposters were
speaking cod French. O f course,
when singing in a language that the
audience understands, extra effort
in enunciation is necessary so the
audience does u n d e r s t a n d !
Generally the diction was good as
was the comic riming. Best all round
was the wonderful Thomas Allen
(newly CBE). However, there was
no weak link i n the soloist line up.
Notably, Claire Powell (Prince
Orlofsky) managed a difficult part
well. The American, Carol Vaness,
as Rosalinde was definitely a case of
'She who must be obeyed'. Lillian
Watson's Adele was as impish as
she had been on the Coliseum stage,
though not always i n tune, but
Denis O ' N e i l was an entertaining
and convincing Italian (Welsh!)
tenor both theatrically and vocally.
In conclusion, the 'bat's revenge'
was a n unqualified success and I
look forward to seeing it later in the
run when it has settled down. By
now you should be convinced, so I
advise you to get d o w n to the box
office in Floral Street.
Remaining performances: Sat
21st, Tue 24th.
