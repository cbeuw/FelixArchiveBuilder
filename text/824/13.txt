IC RADIO
Tune i n to IC Radio every Monday
morning from 8am to 9.15am for the
freshest start to the week. Filled
with many of the regular features
f r o m last year i n c l u d i n g the
infamous 9.05 classic, this will prove
a tasty sandwich i n the lunchbox of
life.
This is a warning for all y o u
people out there. Watch out! Also
this is a reminder to listen to IC
Radio every Thursday at 1pm for the
'Fast Trouser Show'. A s usual it will
be smattered with a sprinkling of
M i k e ' s H a n d y T i p s , m e d i a
muddles, and competitions galore
where mugs can w i n a signed
limited edition poster and even an
album—with an occasional 'Garry
Green' popping u p here and there,
you can be assured of a really good
read of your favourite textbook.
Remember no FT, no comment.
PS. A n FT tip: If y o u are having
problems w i t h your flatmates
barging into your room when you're
busy, try playing Wet Wet Wet.
Guaranteed to send every drip
running.
AUDIOSOC
The A u d i o Society has two main
functions, to promote good hi-fi and
to r u n a b u y i n g club giving
discounts on records, tapes, C D ' s ,
etc. The first objective is achieved
t h r o u g h demonstrations b y
manufacturers and by lending the
Society's o w n e q u i p m e n t to
m e m b e r s . M o s t of the
demonstrations will be of British hi-
fi since it's usually much better than
the majority of Japanese hardware
that floods the market.
There's little to say about the
buying club except that we get
records and pre-recorded tapes for
£5 or £6, C D ' s for about £9 and good
discounts on blank tapes, videos,
accessories, etc. Orders can be made
on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the
Union S C R (first floor of Union) at
12.30pm, a n d collected o n the
following Thursday.
The first demonstration for this
term will be given by Linn o n
Tuesday January 24. They will be
s h o w i n g o f f some of their
equipment, probably the Sondek
LP12 and Axis turntables and their
amplifiers and loudspeakers. The
demo will be held i n the Holland
Club function room at 7.30pm. To
get to the room y o u must go
through the Holland Club and out
the exit at the back.
Anyone interested i n the Society
is welcome to come along to any of
the meetings o n Tuesdays a n d
Thursdays i n the Union S C R or
come to the demonstration next
week.
IC—4
Southampton—3
IC stormed into the last 16 of the
U A U with a scintillating display of
'total football' that left highly rated
Southampton shell-shocked. Back at
full-strength for the first time in six
weeks and determined to improve
on the dismal form of recent weeks,
IC started strongly and were two up
w i t h i n fifteen minutes after
spectacular strikes from Pip Peel and
Byron W o o d . Southampton then
began to wake u p and pulled one
back but fell two behind again on
the half hour when Paul Olden
drilled home a header from a corner.
Southampton pressed forward once
more a n d ensured a n exciting
second half when they sprung the
IC offside trap to score on the stroke
of half-time.
The pace of the game quickened
somewhat after the interval and
there were chances at both ends but
the score remained the same until
twenty minutes from the end when
a Southampton free kick, albeit
deflected, found its way past a
rather static S i Holden. With the
scores now level IC heads dipped
temporarily, but captain Nigel
Collier rallied his men, first hitting
the bar with a delicate lob and then
beating four men and dummying
the keeper to resotre the lead. With
ten minutes still r e m a i n i n g .
Southampton threw everything
forward but were thwarted by solid
defending and a vital save from Si
Holden in the last minute to atone
for his earlier error.
Important
Notice
This term's indoor nets commence
on Thursday January 19th at 7-8pm,

very full fixture list is already
planned, coupled with this, an
indoor tournament is also confirmed
for this term.
There is room for about twenty
people to attend each week. To give
some idea of how many to expect it

Mech Eng Foyer at 5.45pm, or
indicate on the noticeboard if y o u

FENCING
En Garde
We arrived i n Aberwystwyth after
an eventful journey d o w n the M 4
and over the mountains and headed
out for a chippie and pub i n true
fashion.
The epee on Friday held several
surprises—a couple of star turns
failed to shine, however, Ian Droper
The Squash Club will be holding a
k n o c k o u t c o m p e t i t i o n w i t h
American scoring (all can compete
on an equal basis). Sponsorship for
this has not yet been finalised, but
may be forthcoming from Goudie
International, the team's sponsor.
The competition w i l l be held
t h r o u g h o u t term, w i t h some
Wednesday afternoon court time
put aside specifically for it. A n y
members that are interested should
sign the sheet o n the Sports Centre
noticeboard with both name and
membership number.
To change the subject, Stuart
Farrar, the Goudie representative
and coach is offering coaching to
members. Standards can vary from
intermediate to team standard. It
takes the form of practicing routines
in groups of four per court, and is
reasonably fitness based (as
opposed to receiving intensive
technique tuition). Cost will be
about £ 2 0 with places strictly
limited, given on a first-come first-
served basis. Those interested
should sign the list o n the Sports
Centre noticeboard (name a n d
number) and turn up at 5.45pm,
Friday 20/27 January with kit and a
cheque book.
