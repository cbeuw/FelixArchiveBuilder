THE IVS R OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
With student support a reversal of the scheme may be possible
IC Union lobby Parliament
Over 170 Students from Imperial
attended the Students' Union lobby
of Parliament yesterday afternoon.
The lobby was supported by the
Rector and the College's Governing
b o d y a n d most departments
cancelled lectures, tutorials a n d
laboratory sessions to enable
students to take part i n the action.
O n e M P c o m m e n d e d a l l the
students present as 'well- behaved'
and saying that he felt the afternoon
had been 'carefully organised.'
Before the lobby M r Peter Brooke,
Chairman of the Conservative Party
and M P for Westminster North,
addressed the College o n the issue
of student loans expressing the
G o v e r n m e n t ' s v i e w p o i n t . H e
argued that the loan system was
justified, claiming that it reduced the
pressure on parental contributions
and would increase the number of
students entering higher education
as a result. He rejected the views of
several students w h o stated that
school-leavers would be deterred
from entering higher education as
a direct consequence of the loan
system.
Chairman of the meeting, Neil
McClusky noted that a survey
carried out at Edinburgh University
concluded that 40% of school-
leavers would be discouraged from
entering universities or polytechnics
under a loans scheme. M r Brooke
felt this survey was biased by
students' wishes to affect the future
of the loans scheme. 'Faced with the
same questions once the loan
scheme is i n action,' he claimed,
'they w o u l d probably • vote
differently.'
The Government's reference to
the Swedish system of loans i n its
White Paper was raised by a number
of students. One student said that
in a survey carried o u t b y
Gothenburg University, 65% of the
i lowest socio-economic group, who
I had the relevant qualifications, were
Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker
deterred from going to university
because of the Swedish loans
system.
M r Brooke refused to accept
predictions about the effects a loans
system would have and said 'the
test will be in how many people will
take u p the loans when they are
available.' One student commented
'It is ridiculous to allow o u r
education system to suffer i n the
same way as the Swedish one before
we take any action to remedy the
situation.'
M r Brooke insisted that no
condemnation of the system would
be fair until it had been tried.
It was suggested to M r Brooke
that an increase of 1% in the upper
tax bracket would 'more than
provide for the £108M needed to
restore grants to the 1979 level, i n
real terms.' M r Brooke replied that
a large number of people i n the
higher tax bracket are not graduates
and as such would object to paying
for further education.
IC Union President, Nigel Baker
said afterwards, 'I thought that the
meeting was a success because it
allowed the students a chance to
question the Government first-
hand. I do not think that we
changed his mind, but at least we
had a go.'
The responses from M P s at the
Parliamentary lobby were mixed.
Graham Riddick, Conservative M P
for the Colne Valley, claimed that
the implementation of student loans
w o u l d make students more
responsible about entering higher
education because they would 'have
to think about the money first.' H e
refused to accept one students'
claims that loans would discriminate
against students from low-income
families. H e argued that the
incentive of good jobs after leaving
university w o u l d 'more than
compensate' for the expense of the
course. Different views were voiced
by another Conservative M P , M r
Tony Speller, who implied that the
concept of students being seen to be
paying for further education was a
good v o t e - w i n n e r a m o n g the
working classes.
A number of other Conservative
MPs were sympathetic to the views
of students a n d expressed a n
interest i n modifying the loans-
scheme proposal as it stands. M r
Stephen Day, Conservative M P for
Cleesdale, said he would attempt to
increase the hardship fund and M r
Richard Page, another Conservative
M P was particularly sympathetic
about the specific problems that
would be encountered at Imperial
and other London colleges.
