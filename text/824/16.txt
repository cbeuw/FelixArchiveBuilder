Imperial, noted that Mr Baker's
plans were particularly unfair in that
they did not differentiate between
universities inside and outside
London. Mr Robert Rhodes-James,
Conservative MP for Cambridge,
wholeheartedly supported the
lobby. He claimed to be one of the
few Tory back-benchers who are
fighting the loan system and said
that with student support in the
form of letters and lobbies a reversal
of the scheme may be possible.
Lynne Golding, Labour MP for
Newcastle-Under-Lyme, claimed
that although the Labour Party
sympathised with students there is
'nothing they can do.' She said,
'Mrs Thatcher will push it through
anyway,' and described the scheme
as 'depressing'. A number of other
Labour MPs expressed their support
for the student action and said they
would attempt to block the paper.
ICU Hon Sec Ian Morris, whose
report 'Student Loans: The London
Factor' initiated much interest in the
loans issue by Imperial students,
was very pleased with the event and
said it would 'do a lot more good
than the N U S march last
November.'
ULU President goes
Stewart Jackson announced his resignation from his position as President of the University of London Union
(ULU) at an Emergency General Union Council (GUC) on Wednesday. His resignation was followed by a vote
of no confidence in Mr Jackson in a move designed to clarify the position of ULU with the University of London.
Mr Jackson was accused by
members of G U C of having no
respect for his executive, the
Consituent Colleges and GUC.
In a short defensive speech, Mr
Jackson admitted to claims that he
had made 'political capital' from his
position as President. He claimed
that ULU was 'a politically bankrupt
organisation.'
Responding to accusations that he
had failed to support ULU's
campaign against Student Loans he
said that the Union should be
'realistic' in its approach. 'I haven't
sold anyone out on Student Loans,'
he added later.
As one of four Conservative
Student Union Presidents in the
country, Mr Jackson told the
meeting, 'You're bound to be
frustrated by 10 years of Tory
Government.' He claimed that, as
a left-wing dominated group,
Student Unions will be wiped out
by the Government. 'They'll say
you've got no political credibility,'
he said.
ULU's executive is reported to
have been furious at Mr Jackson's
Jackson out, Jones in
interview in last Friday's Times
Higher Education Supplement
(THES).
Without informing other members
of the U L U executive, Mr Jackson
told THES of his intention to resign,
saying that 'being a Conservative in
student politics is like being a fox at
a beagle hunt.'
Mr Jackson retains his
membership as student
representative on several London
University Committees including
Court and Senate since he is
registered with them in name,
rather than under his post.
UGM's to go
Council top b
o
d
y
?
A motion calling for the abolition of
Union GeneBd Meetings (UGM's)
has been put forward to Monday's
Union Council for discussion. The
motion has been tabled by the
working party looking into the
problems of merger between
Imperial College Union and St
Mary's Hospital Medical School
Union and is designed to overcome
the difficulties students from St
Mary's would have attending
UGM's at the Imperial site.
The motion states that Council, as
opposed to UGM's should become
the supreme decision making body
of the Union. Under the proposal,
non-Council members will be
allowed to submit motions to
Council provided that they have 150
seconders. Elections for Union costs
will be carried out by 'election
meetings' held at Imperial and St
Mary's. Non members of Council
will be permitted to observe Council
meetings and to request speaking
rights.
Deputy President Chas Brereton
told FELIX that the working party
had considered a number of
alternatives to abolishing UGM's
including holding separate C C U
UGM's and alternating the site of
UGM's between IC and St Mary's
but had rejected them as
impractical.
'If we had UGM's only at IC we
would be accused of being
undemocratic' he said.
Mr Brereton went on to say that
the requirement for motions to have
150 seconders would give proposals
'more credibility.' He added that the
problem of Union Officers not being
accountable to ordinary students
could be 'easily alleviated by
ensuring that officers' reports are
pinned up on a notice board.'
The motion also calls for the St
Mary's residence, Wilson House, to
be prioritised as accommodation for
medical students with the rest of
IC's accommodation being
prioritised for non medical students
and calls for representation for St
Mary's and the other CCU's on
ULU's General Union Council
(GUC).
If the motion is approved by
Council it will be forwarded to the
next Union General Meeting for
discussion.
