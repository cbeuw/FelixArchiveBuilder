Union appoints new
Welfare Adviser

New locks
N e w locks were introduced in the
Union Building over the Christmas
. holidays i n an attempt to increase
security a n d reduce the large
number of thefts taking place.
Union Deputy President Chas
Brereton w h o was responsible for
the scheme told FELIX that he
suspected that many of the pieces
of stolen equipment in the Union
had been lost to unscrupulous staff
and student members who have
copies of the o l d 'Arthur' R37
master key. He added 'It is quite
possible that ex-staff are coming
back a n d using keys to obtain
equipment from within the Union
Building'. H e claimed that there
were 'masses' of the keys going
round and he blamed this on the
fact that the locks have not been
changed since 'before he was born'.
The new A S S A 6000 keys have
proved successful so far according
to M r Brereton w h o a d d e d
'however, the doors of the Union
are so bad that if someone wanted
to enter the building it would be
easier to knock the doors d o w n
rather than touch the lock.'
The new keys to the external
doors have been issued only to the
sabbatical officers and the Union
Manager, David Peacock. Chairmen
of clubs and societies, and other club
members deemed to require a key
by the Union President will be given
keys to their storerooms. Entry to
the main Union Building between
the hours of 11.30 p m and 6 am will
be via the Beit security staff subject
to clearance by M r Brereton and
Sherfield security.

No smoke

decided upon at a Union Catering
Committee Meeting. The meeting
I also noted a 21% drop in lunchtime
I sales compared to the '87-'88

Imperial College U n i o n h a s
appointed a new Welfare Adviser,
Yve Posner.
The cost of the new appointment
will be met by the College and the
Union are hoping to persuade the
College to contribute a £7000 annual
welfare budget. If this move is
unsuccesful the money will be
raised by cutting back expenditure
on clubs and societies, according to
Union President Nigel Baker.
Ms Posner will be able to advise
students on housing benefits and
landlord/ tenant relations, as well as
legal, consumer and immigration
problems. She will also provide
assistance with letter writing, phone
calls and filling in forms. She will be
available for consultation from 1pm
onwards from Tuesdays to Fridays
in the Welfare Office in the Union
Building, formerly the Jazz and Rock
Club.
Forms, leaflets a n d reference
books will also be available from the
Welfare Office.
M s Posner has t e n years
experience in welfare and benefit
work including seven and a half
years working for the D H S S , a year
as leader of the Haringey private
sector housing benefit team and
eighteen months as a Welfare
Officer for Islington Council.
Higher
rents
Students may lose some of their
protection against eviction and may
have to pay higher rents as a result
of the first stage of the 1988 Housing
Act which came into effect last
Sunday.
Two n e w forms of tenancy
agreement have been produced:
long term 'assured tenancies', and
'assured shorthold tenancies' which
are for fixed periods, some as short
as six months. Both increase the
landlords' power by allowing the
landlord to set rents at 'market
levels' and, unlike current contracts,
to apply to the court for eviction if
the terms are broken or if the tenant
is more than three months i n
arrears.
Landlords are also permitted to
charge 'key money' for taking up or
renewing a contract.
Most students' landlords are
expected to opt for six month
assured shorthold tenancies. These
will give the tenants only six months
guaranteed residence, after which
the landlord has the right to evict.
Any contract entered into before
last Sunday will still be covered by
the old act. The new regulations are
only likely to come into effect when
contracts are renewed or n e w
contracts entered i n t o . T h e
tenancies will be administered by
Rent Assessment C o m m i t t e e s
which have replaced the more
powerful Fair Rent Office. The
committees have no power over
new contracts but they can attempt
to block excessive rent rises.
