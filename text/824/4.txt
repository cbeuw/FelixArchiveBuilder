So you are in your final year now,
eh? What are you going to d o
afterwards? Don't know? Good,
you are just the person who'll make
a good accountant. But I'm afraid
that if you started your academic life
by being sacked from your first
kindergarten, then please continue
f i l l i n g i n those S A F ' s f o r
engineering firms. In less tactful
circles, you'll be k n o w n as a
kindergarten drop-out.
Yes, sir, this career is for the hi-
fliers. That means quite a lot of you,
j u d g i n g f r o m the n u m b e r of
engineering students going into
accountancy.
'So w h y s h o u l d I be a n
accountant?', a clever dick amongst
you asks. 'I don't want anything to
do with those, Uerggh, yuppies!',
says another. Very true. "They are
boring'. True. True. 'Counting
books, machines, m o n e y or
whatever it may be that other
people have, is not my idea of a
career'. H m m , you might have a
point there. 'What?! Three more
years of study. N o thanks, I've had
enough of three years here'. Alright,
A l r i g h t (will the clever dicks
amongst you shut up so that I can
get on with my article here?).
So there might be a few, how shall
I put it, setbacks in this. But there
is one thing that will totally eclipse
that viz. Loadsamoney!!
Yep, folks, there's gold in them
thar' filofaxes.
A n d for those do-gooders out
there w h o might be inclined to
question the ethics and related
rubbish of this kind, then I'd like to
quote an authority on moral ethics,
that great bastion of capitalism, the
idols of yuppies (whose name has
currently stepped on a banana skin
in my brain) 'greed is good'. That
should p u t to rest any moral
maelstrom that has ever sprouted in
your mind. ( A h yes! It was Gordon
Gekko.)
So how do you go about joining
this noble profession? This article
will tell you all you need to-know
and more.
First of all, you've got to decide
which firm to apply to. That, of
course, would be the firm with the
biggest salary and benefits. Let us
say that it falls to the chartered
accountancy firm Brown, Brown,
Brown, Brown & Brown. One thing
one must k n o w is that accountancy
firms only take those bozos who are
passionately interested i n joining
them so if you do not fall into that
special category of bozos, w h o
know their Ernst & Whinney's from
their Peat Marwick's, then apply to
the lot a n d be passionately
interested in joining any firm who
bothers to call you for an interview.
The initial part of the application
f o r m regarding your personal
history should be easy enough. In
passing,' I'd just like to point out
that it pays to be economical with
the truth. I'm not asking anyone to
lie (shock, gasp, horror!), I'm just
initiating you into a few facts of life.
If you find yourself unable to
finish this portion, with enough
spice to pale Madras Vindaloo in
comparison, then I'm afraid you are,
as the saying goes, up the spaghetti
junction without a steering wheel.
You might as well crash out now.
A n d then comes the hard part,
filling i n those stupid questions,
along the lines of 'Why do you want
to be an accountant', 'What is your
career plan?' etc. Don't despair, the
majority of students hit against a
blank brain at this point. The correct
procedure, or so I'm advised by a
friend, is to find out who is the
literary buff in your year from the
departmental grapevine. Then you
have to pile h i m with enough free
beers/Mars bars ('Investing in the
future') to become matey. When
you feel you have reached the stage
where you and h i m are a couple of
real good pals, like what's-his-name
and who-was-it i n the Bible, then
you have to delicately introduce him
to your little problem. Ten minutes
later, your problem's solved. Eleven
minutes later, you dump him.
N e x t , to ensure a g o o d
recommendation, you have to get in
the good books of your tutor. Be
generous with the butter. It's just
too b a d if y o u ' v e spent a
considerable portion of your time
here, avoiding them i n the lifts and
corridors. Put the good old stone on
the heart and get on with it.
Write a covering letter i n the
bestest of your writing and English,
r e m e m b e r i n g to remove a n y
dripping nosegoo and beer or curry
stains from the paper and the
application form, and post it to the
relevant geezer at Brown, Brown^
Brown, Brown & Brown.
The poet W o r d s w o r t h h a s
recorded how his cardiovascular
system was apt to leap up when he
beheld a rainbow in the sky and this
could be how your system behaved
when you beheld the letter from the
abovementioned gang about two
weeks later. If you've followed my
advice you will find within a note
registering you to call on them at the
relevant time and date.
The interview is your important
chance to strike 'em dead with your
charisma a n d knowledge. It is
important here to dress well.
Intelligent as you are, you can see
that a bimbo—call him Bimbo I—
who wants to impress another
bimbo—Bimbo II—starts at a serious
disadvantage if he is wearing a
crumpled shirt and a jean with a
stylish tear on the knee. Y o u need
to put the PR smile on the face, even
if the amount of cologne the
honourable interviewers are
wearing, gives rise to emotions
possibly comparable to Jack the
Ripper.
Y o u have to convince the
interview panel that you are the
person they've been looking for all
these years. Don't hesitate to tell
them how hard you had to work to
get your 3A's. Show them your
entrepreneurial spirit by giving
details of the security service that
you introduced, for a fixed sum (or
in ten easy instalments), for lower-
formers at your school against the
bully (the fact that the bully was
yourself is completely a n d
absolutely irrelevant). A n d what
about the time when you smuggled
a few books from Foyles and sold
them to friends when you and your
bank manager were having a little
misundestanding. Every bit helps.
A n d again if you have followed
my advice then in a week's time
again, you will receive a letter from
Brown or Brown or Brown or
Brown—or it may even be B r o w n -
informing you of their decision and
wishing you good luck in your job
hunting 'Bashibazzoks, nincum-
poops, tenapins, troglodytes, dipso-
maniacs, filibuster' you quote the
great Captain Haddock expressing
your feelings. ' * © * * ! ? © * * ! ' you
quote yourself, expressing your
feelings a little more i n depth.
Well don't be too hard o n
yourself. Remember all great (and
very rich) men were initially either
ridiculed or rejected b y their
societies. So continue applying, you
are bound to hit it lucky at one time
or another.

It is probably true to say that we
have all adjusted to living i n a
technological world in which science
has gone domestic, business has
gone computer, a n d personal
attention in banks has gone to the
four winds. It is also true to say that
Walter has adjusted less willingly
than most; even he, however, is
now used to bar codes, keypads,
and inserting his card with the black
stripe facing down and to the right.
Notwithstanding this, the latest
electronic attempt on his sanity has
come dangerously close to success.
The device in question is the Psion
Personal Organiser 2. Walter would
like to point out that he personally
does not o w n one of these horrors,
but someone of h i s close
acquaintance does, and is rapidly
making himself unbearable; the air
around h i m is punctuated with an
endless series of beeps and whistles.
Look! If you press this button it
turns itself into a helicopter.
W h i l s t o n the subject of
technology, those ladies a n d
gentleman of Imperial College Radio
have hit the headlines for the second
time i n only six years with their
staunch resistance to the idea of
radio commercials. This is one of
those occasions where Walter really
doesn't understand the workings of
the collective mind of Imperial
College Union. It seems obvious
that a precondition of accepting
advertising is that someone is
listening to it that will be i n a
position to spend money as a result
of it. Students? Imperial College
Radio? Think what you are saying.
M i n d you, when someone does
listen - or read - the power of the
press becomes obvious, as i n the
case of the Caterpillar Cafe, so
named after a story appeared i n
FELIX highlighting the presence of
a certain animal i n the chilli. To
think that Nigel Baker didn't believe
us.
Of course, we all k n o w you
shouldn't believe everything you
read in the press. Certain persons
of small credence have even
extended this to the sayings of our
College Secretary a n d local
diplomat, John Smith. Walter would
suggest that it might be time to start
listening, for the following reason:
John Smith will soon be leaving us,
and it is tempting to speculate that
the good gentleman may have a few
things to say before he goes.
Skeletons from the college closet,
perhaps? Well, we live in hope.
