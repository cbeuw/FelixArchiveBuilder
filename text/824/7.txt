Charter 88 is a call for the
i n t r o d u c t i o n o f a w r i t t e n
constitution for Britain that w o u l d
guarantee civil liberties i n the form
of a B i l l of Rights. It's signatories
believe that freedom could be
curtailed i n this country, writes
R o b i n D a v i s o n .
Is Britain free from threat to
liberty? Generations of Britons have
grown u p expecting to live i n one
of the world's most free countries,
but if asked what their civil liberties
were they could give no reply. This
is because w e have no written
constitution, explaining exactly
what are our rights .
Britain's Parliament is k n o w n as
the 'Mother of Democracy', our
reputation for an impartial and fair
judiciary second to none, and our
liberty is the envy of the world. This
is a prevalent attitude but is
dangerously complacent according
to the signatories of the Charter 88.
The Charter, calls for civil liberties
to be guaranteed by a Bill of Rights
on a model that is similar to the one
which exists i n America. In the
United States all legislation is tested
for unconstitutionality b y the
Supreme Court, the equivalent
body in Britrain would be the House
of Lords.
Britain is unique in
having 300 years of
Parliamentary
democracy
Charter 88 w a s launched i n
conjunction with the New Statesman
and Society and the Electoral Reform
Society. It is endorsed by 250
celebrities; these are mostly
journalists, authors, writers, artists
and politicans w h o c o u l d be
described as liberal-left w i n g
intellectuals and are concerned that
the period the present Government
has been i n power has left civil
liberties undefended.
The advantages of a written
c o n s t i t u t i o n are that the
'entrenched' clauses can only be
changed b y long and protracted
ammendment. A n y Government in
power would find it hard to change
the document because it would have
to be passed by an independent
body. Their idea is that, like in other
countries, the written constitution
would have an 'aura of magic'
which would make it sacrosanct.
The motives of this group appear
honourable, they seem to wish to
preserve freedom, enhance
democracy and are very liberal and
E u r o p e a n i n nature. T h e
disadvantage of a constitutional
change of this nature is that changes
to it can long and protracted. In
A m e r i c a , f o r example, equal
opportunities leglislation has not
been introduced, because all 50
states have to agree to it. Britain,
though not a federal state , could
pass such laws in one Parliamentary
term.
H o w has Britains' unwritten
constition come into being ? We are
unique i n Britain in having had 300
years of parliamentary democracy in
which the network of laws that
preserve our liberty have been
formulated. It is from the 'Glorious
Revolution ' of 1688 that the
principles of a democratic monarchy
have been estalished, but the
signatories of the charter claim that
power of the monarchy was only
shifted from the hands of a n
absolute monarch to a parliamentary
oligarthy. They assert that Britain
has a long history of freedom
documents, for example the Magna
Carta, signed by King John and the
peoples' charter of 1838.
Critics, have claimed that by
apeing the name of the Charter 77
movement i n Czechoslovakia, a
freedom and civil rights Covenant
the written
constitution would
have an 'aura of
magic'
the signatories do no justice to their
case. Conditions here are so much
better than i n the Eastern Block so
as not bare comparison.
The Independent newspaper i n an
editorial p r o p o s e d that the
European Convention on H u m a n
Rights could be incorporated into
the legislature. This would be a
shortcut to achieving the same
objective. The European C o n -
vention was drawn u p after the
Second World War i n a manner
such as to be acceptable to the 21
members of the Council of Europe.
It has several 'let-out' clauses that
would make it more acceptable to
government, f o r example,
interference with the exercise of a
right can be sanctioned, ' i n the
interests of national security, public
safety or the economic well being of
the country '.
The Charter also expresses the
need for electoral reform to a system
of proportional representation and
in doing so has only recieved warm
support from the Labour Party.
Roy Hattersley, Labours deputy
leader, writing i n the Guardian
claims that Charter 88 diminishes
the importance of positive aspects
of freedom. H e claims, focusing
attention o n loss of freedoms, that
state interference of civil rights is not
enough, for example, the right to a
basic 'living' wage. H e cites T H
Green who defined freedom as 'a
positive power or capacity of doing
or enjoying something worth doing
or enjoying'. Green was discussing
the Irish Land Act last century that
prevented landlords and tenants
freely signing agreements in which
they were u s u a l l y ruthlessly
exploited. However the charter has
generally received cross-party
support.
The New Statesman and Society
documents 88 cases where they
believe individual freedoms have
been lost i n the last 100 years. The
Britain has a long
history of freedom
documents
most recent of which is the loss of
the 'right to silence' i n Northern
Ireland's trials, but others just from
1988 include the ban of interviews
of paramilitary supporters on radio
and television.
The supporters of Charter 88 do
not believe that their demands will
be met immediately they consider
that change of this magnitude
w o u l d take over 25 years to
complete, however the discussion of
H u m a n Rights is their immediate
objective. Perhaps it should be
remembered that few people ever
miss their liberty until it is taken
away from them.
