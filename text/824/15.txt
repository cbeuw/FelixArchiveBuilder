Student Loans. B y the time this
comes out I will have met with Pete
Mee, the College's Registrar, to go
over the figures presented i n my
paper on the effect of student loans
on those studying i n London.
Subsequent to this, a Governing
Body working party is being set up
to assess h o w best to defend
students in London against this and
a multitude of other 'sins'.
Carnival. May 1 apologise to
anyone who couldn't get in o n
Friday evening. Unfortunately we
had sold out to the fire capacity limit
by 9.45pm and had to allow ticket
holders only to enter.
This gave rise to a number of
problems, namely people trying to
break into the building from the
back and trying to force the front
gates open. Due to these actions, a
number of complaints have been
lodged which may jeopardise future
bar extensions and/or prevent us
from holding Carnivals again.
Thanks to everybody that helped,
particularly Chas Brereton and Jon
Denham for manning the gates and
to the Wing Chun security for what
must have been a trying night.
Industrial Relations Committee.
The IRC are meeting (for the first
time) on Wednesday January 25 to
decide its aims etc.
Wrestling. Tickets priced £2.50
and £4 (ringside) are available from
my office. Please support this event
as all profits will be going to charity
as well as being a dead good laugh.
Don't forget the Superbowl o n
Sunday i n the Lounge at 9.30pm
and the Scotland, Wales Rugby
International tomorrow in the Snack
Bar at 2pm.

DP's bit for Felix
1) Key system: A s you may know,
we have had a new key system
installed i n the Union Building.
Clubs and Societies who as yet
haven't conatcted me as regards
getting keys for their members
should do so as soon as possible. A
£25 refundable deposit is payable for
E A C H K E Y issued.
2) Bar Prices: A s a result of the
recent pay awards, which were up
to f2%, it has been necessary to
increase beer prices by about 3p per
pint. Union Bar prices are still
substantially cheaper than the local
pubs.
3) Lecturer Questionnaire: This will
be run again this term as last year.
Your Departmental Rep will arrange
specific dates and times for you to
fill in the forms. Unlike last year,
which was just a pilot run to test the
mechanics of running a College-
wide lecturer questionnaire, and the
results of which were only issued to
staff members, this year results will
be published in full.
4) Security in the Union Building:
As a result of recent thefts from club
storerooms and lockers, I will be
instigating random checks of Union
cards and Club membership cards
(where appplicable). Please ensure
that you have your card on you at
all times. Your co-operation is
appreciated.

RCS sing
the burger
blues
A new year, a new term and a new
case of listeria for that coq au vin
you thought would keep from last
term. So far there has been a lot
happening RCS-wise. The most
important new change is the sad
departure of Professor John Albery
as Dean of the Royal College of
Science. Prof Albery is off to
pastures new i n Oxford, he has
been a popular Dean bringing new
light to both the R C S U handbook
and i n compering the Smoking
Concert last year. H e has been
replaced by Professor Jim Barber of
Pure and Applied Biology, we are
all looking forward to meeting and
working with Prof Barber and wish
him as much success as Prof Albery
as Dean.
If you were at the Carnival on
Friday you will have noticed RCS
cooking burgers again, it proved to
be a successful night with the rain
holding off until four seconds after
the last burger had been sold!
However, we are still looking into
selling 351bs of onions and about
fifteen jars of Dijon mustard,
anyone interested? Last week
should have seen the RCS Rag Tour
(Northern), unfortunately due to
lack of drivers last weekend it has
had to be postponed until the first
weekend in February.
That is what has happened but
what have we got in store for the
rest of this term? O n February 10th
we will be holding the Annual RCS
Dinner, there will be a celebrity
guest speaker and tickets will be
going on sale soon, priced just
under £20. Also on sale this term
will be tickets fro the highlight of the
year, the Silwood Ball on May 5th,
the price of these will be £55.
Finally, near the end of this term
will be the RCS trip abroad, this year
we are going to Amsterdam, it's an
amazing city so do save up your
pennies and be sure to go on this
one.
So, until next time, this is Dave
the V P signing off.
