ative Commons
to power through coalition deals.
The party that wins the most
seats has the first opportunity to
form a government, and attempt to
pass a Queen’s speech through the
new parliament. If this fails, then
an alternative administration can
be created. If, for whatever reason,
coalition talks completely fall flat
then we could see a second election
this year, though this is highly
unlikely.
Questions of legitimacy will
inevitably arise. Should the prime
minister be the leader of the
largest party, or the leader who can
command the greatest coalition
majority in the House of Commons?
Who is willing to hold hands
with Cameron?
The Conservatives have ruled out a
coalition with Labour, the SNP, the
Greens and Plaid Cymru, leaving
UKIP, the DUP and the Lib Dems as
the only realistic partners.
However, the Lib Dems wouldn’t
be likely to make compromises for
the sake of the small number of
UKIP MPs, and even if all four of
these parties did somehow agree
on a coalition they won’t make the
numbers.
This has led many to consider
the possibility of a grand Labour-
Conservative coalition, similar to
what occurred during World War II
with Churchill’s war ministry. But
this would be truly remarkable in
British politics.
The unlikelihood of a grand
coalition, despite its superficial
appeal, cannot be overstated.
Whether it’s Ed Miliband or David
Cameron walking into Downing
Street, they will need to show a great
deal of humility and must give the
impression of a cooperative spirit.
The next parliament is set to be one of
the most volatile and unstable in our
history.
Electoral reform could be put back
on the agenda, despite the fact we had
an alternative vote referendum only
four years ago.
We have officially moved into a
more continental style of politics. The
Labour-Conservative duopoly has
broken down, perhaps for good.
In the next few days Northern
Ireland’s representatives might come
to the fore, if the right-wing DUP
and left-wing Sinn Fein enter into
negotiations with the Conservatives
and Labour respectively. The DUP are
looking to win around 8 seats while
Sinn Fein are expected to have 5 MPs
in parliament.
This could make all the difference
for a party to crawl across the 326
finishing line.
It is important to mention that
instead of formal coalitions, where
smaller coalition partners typically
receive cabinet and ministerial
positions in government as the
Lib Dems did in 2010, some minor
“We have
officially
moved into
a more
continental
style of
politics.”
“The next
parliament
could be
one of
the most
volatile and
unstable
in our
history.”
parties could agree to a ‘confidence
and supply’ arrangement where they
vote through a Queen’s speech and
pass vital actions of the government
through the House of Commons,
without being given official positions.
In this case, their influence would
come through when negotiating with
the larger party on the nature of the
policy, budget, law or anything else
being discussed.
The big prediction
Conservatives and the Lib Dems have
both lost two dozen seats, Labour
gained a dozen, the SNP won at least
three dozen more constituencies in
Scotland and other parties such as
UKIP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru
have made no significant advances
in parliamentary representation.
This would put the Tories on around
290, Labour on 260, the Lib Dems on
roughly 25 and the SNP on up to 55. (I
trust in Nate Silver).
