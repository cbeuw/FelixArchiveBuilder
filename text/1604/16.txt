Amelie Lecoeuche shares her environmentally friendly summer plan
Driving... to save the planet?
“What are you doing
this summer?” I am
driving to Mongolia
with my father. Not a conventional
tourist destination for a couple
of UK residents, I’ll admit, but we
have always preferred adventurous
destinations over beaches crammed
with lobster-red tourists eating ice-
cream and tripping over beach towels.
There is something so much more
fulfilling about exploring a different
culture independently and seeing
how local people live compared
to staying in one fixed place and
participating in the structured,
predictable day-trips organised by a
generic big-name travel company.
Between the pair of us, Dad and I
have crossed a variety of countries on
foot; by train; by rickshaw; and 4X4,
each time stopping and seeing what
each region had to offer on the way.
This time we have teamed up to cross
most of the breadth of Eurasia, as a
kind of nod to our love of adventure
before I move out of the family home
for good.
The best part of our plan is that this
endeavour – being on a somewhat
larger scale than normal – is going to
be done in the name of a good cause.
This is because my father and I are
not driving to Ulaanbaatar entirely
on our own: we are doing it as one of
the teams entering the Mongol Rally
for 2015.
Apparently, there are enough mad
people out there who want to break
down in the middle of a desert or
half way up a mountain for dozens
of teams to pack their bags and drive
to Mongolia from the UK every year,
and there are even organisations who
help with the important legal bits like
how to get visas and ship the car back
home.
Dad and I are doing the Mongol Rally
with the Adventurists, which means
that we will have to comply with
three golden rules:
1.You can only take a farcically
small vehicle
2.You’re completely on your own
3.You’ve got to raise £1000 for
charity
The Vehicle
In our case, the ridiculously small
and underpowered car will be
a 26-year-old Citroen AX. This
is a car older than most of the
Undergraduates at Imperial. With
a top speed of under 60mph, it is a
car which actually gets overtaken
by speed-limited lorries on the
motorway, and where you wait until
a downhill stretch before attempting
any overtaking yourself.
This car will need to deal with
roads covered in rocks, pitted with
potholes, or potentially covered in
sand. The kind of roads associated
with big, powerful cars with high
ground-clearance. Even with larger
wheels fitted, you wouldn’t be able to
fit a normal tin can under the AX. As
for power, I suppose we could attempt
to fit a sail to the roof and pray for
wind.
A lot of work has gone into fitting
the Citroen with a sump guard, to
protect the underside of the car
from attacks from aggressive rocks.
This constituted getting hold of a
large sheet of aluminium – the kind
you normally see making up metal
walkways – and cutting the thing
down to size. Dad then made a large
indent at the point where it needed
to bend to weaken it, and we had to
strategically roll over it with a (larger)
car in order to get it to fold correctly.
It is now majestically bolted under
the front of the AX.
We also need to pack a lot of
gear: tents, camping stove, sleeping
bags, clothes, maps, water, jerricans
of spare fuel, and spare tyres. It’s
pretty heavy stuff- so much so that
Dad had to beef up the suspension
to prevent the car from sinking too
low. It will be a tight squeeze in a car

"There are
enough
mad people
out there...
pack their
bags and
drive to
Mongolia."
