Joshua Renken outlines what will have
happened last night, and what the next
fews days may have in store for the
government
The elections are now
over: so what’s next?
This election was a big one. The
stakes were incredibly high;
with the size of the state, the
union of the United Kingdom and
our position in the European Union
on the ballot, and with the added
nuanced policy debates around the
NHS, immigration, housing, our
nuclear defenses, the continuation of
austerity and political reform, there
was certainly something for everyone
to sink their teeth into.
But for all the impact that the
results will have, you would be
forgiven for thinking this was a
pretty standard issue election. All the
parties ran remarkably risk averse,
sterilised and sometimes downright
dull election campaigns, with no real
stand-out moments.
And to top it all off, after all the
sound and fury, the polls didn’t seem
to budge after more than a month of
campaigning, much to the annoyance
of journalists looking for a headline.
The Conservatives were edging it
in the polls for the last few weeks of
the campaign, during which time
the various party leaders universally
opted for a very stage-managed
appeal to voters through the media,
with virtually no walkabouts among
the general public and a great deal of
backroom spin.
So, in case you haven’t heard, we
have a hung parliament. If we don’t
have a hung parliament this article
will sound very stupid indeed, but
everyone will be too distracted by
hell freezing over to care about my
blunder. In fact, this time round we
have an even more ‘hung’ parliament
than in 2010. Unfortunately this
article was written before the
results actually came in, but we will
struggle manfully on (Fucking print
journalism, you can see why it’s dying
can’t you?).
This means that regardless of
whether the Conservatives or Labour
have won the most seats, we still do
not have a majority government.
Neither party reached the magic
number of 326 seats (half the
number of MPs plus one) so they
need extra support from smaller
parties to ‘command the confidence
of the House of Commons’ and
pass a Queen’s speech, the only test
for a stable government that really
matters.
This means we are in for a
fascinating few days, or even weeks, of
coalition talks.
Here’s what could happen...
Farage’s UKIP steals the
votes but not the seats
Despite winning around an eighth
of the votes across England, UKIP
only have a tiny number of MPs in
parliament. Nigel Farage’s party has
made a huge impact on the results
of this election, but not because of
the constituencies they won. Rather
because they will have stolen a decent
chunk of traditional Tory votes,
which would have otherwise won
David Cameron the election. Farage
has said that if he loses in the South
Thanet he is contesting he would step
down, giving huge motivation for
the larger parties to keep him out of
Westminster.
The Lib Dems will be the
hardest hit, but there could
be another coalition on the
horizon
The Liberal Democrats will have
lost a large number of their MPs,
with only those more Tory-leaning
managing to survive. The slightly
more left leaning Lib Dems will lose
out to Labour in many marginal
constituencies.
Despite experiencing heavy losses,
they still have a big influence in
coalition talks.
Nick Clegg has ruled out a coalition
deal with the SNP, but has said he
would be prepared to agree to a deal
with Labour.
Many Lib Dems were strongly
opposed to the coalition deal struck
between Clegg and Cameron in 2010,
and the Lib Dems have traditionally
been considered ideologically closer
to Labour than the Conservatives,
though this might be brought into
question if another Lib Dem –
Conservative coalition deal is struck.
What will happen beyond the
wall?
The SNP have overtaken the Lib
Dems as the third largest party in
parliament – though not by the
number of votes across the UK – but
the Scottish nationalists will only be
backbenchers, provided Ed Miliband
does not go back on his promise not
to strike any kind of deal with Nicola
Sturgeon. Miliband might come
to seriously regret that decision if
it scuppers his chances of forming
anything other than a Labour
minority government.
There is a certain degree of
crossover in the Labour and SNP
manifestos, and around three quarter
of all votes cast in Scotland will be for
one of these two parties, which have
led many to suspect that the SNP
would give their tacit approval to a
Labour administration.
Some major Labour scalps will
have fallen to the SNP, as Sturgeon
made the weather north of the
border. They’ve outflanked Labour
by offering a more convincing
alternative to the Conservatives, in
addition to winning added support as
the pro-independence party, which
was supported by 45% of Scots in the
referendum last year.
The SNP have positioned
themselves as a bolder, more
progressive left-wing party than
Labour, by opposing austerity and
calling to scrap Trident. On top of
this, the referendum allowed the
Scottish Nationals to sell their brand
virtually non-stop for two years,
while the Westminster parties were
on the same side working together
which as tainted Scottish Labour. If,
by some minor miracle, many in the
last cabinet manage to defend their
seats against the wave of SNP support,
the Liberal Democrat-Conservative
coalition could be in for a second
innings.
The story of this election is
definitely that of relative stagnation
in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, but revolution in Scotland.
Much of this is down to the SNP’s
charismatic leader Nicola Sturgeon,
who is the only party leader who isn’t
actually standing as an MP.
The closest election yet?
2015 has seen a huge number of seats
decided by less than a thousand votes
either way, with many constituencies
on a knife-edge on top of very tight
parliamentary arithmetic.
DUP wins Northern Ireland,
Labour wins Wales, the Conservatives
win England and the SNP win
Scotland.
If Labour and the Conservatives
are on a very similar number of seats,
plus or minus 15 from 280, then
Miliband is more likely to become the
next PM, because he has more paths
