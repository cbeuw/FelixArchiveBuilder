Choosing the lesser of the evils

George Butcher considers why actually, everyone is just awful
“they aren’t
going to win
the election
– just maybe
make the
others a little
bit less shit.”
It’s a cliché that when we vote, we
do it with a peg over our nose and
try and chose the ‘least bad’ of all
of them. Sadly this election seems to
suffer from a particularly bad dose.
Let’s start with the Conservatives.
They have led some of the most
unfair policies, particularly for young
people. Pensioners have had tax
exceptions and increased pensions
whilst young people pay for their
own degrees, can no longer claim
housing welfare and still have a lower
minimum wage. Food banks are the
biggest source of growth over the past
five years and no economist I’ve read
from has anything good to say about
the Conservative Party’s economic
policies. They’ve slashed the deficit
when the government can borrow
money at just 0.5% and given us an
incredibly unproductive workforce.
Meanwhile Labour has swung to
the left. Their response to a shortage
of housing is to promise a rent cap,
and capping energy prices and rail
fares (pushing up prices before they’re
even in government). But despite all
this, they’ve somehow convinced the
Scottish people that they’re more
right wing than Blair. Their ability
to communicate is awful, and that’s
where Ed Miliband comes in. Can
you imagine him at a foreign summit
with Vladimir Putin? Negotiating
over peace in the Middle East?
Communication and leadership does
matter if you want to make useful
changes and not just struggle through
a single term.
So who is remaining? The Green
Party are more socialist than most
of Labour – they want to stop
economic growth (literally) and
give everyone a “citizen’s salary”.
OK – so they’re a minority left wing
party, so what? The problem is that
they perpetuate the myth that you
need to be left wing to care about the
environment – which is not only
untrue, but deeply damaging. The
environment shouldn’t just be for
beardy hippies – but for everyone.
It’s the most important cause that has
received almost zero coverage in the
campaigning this election, at least
partly because it’s associated with the
socialism of the greens.
UKIP – I have very little to say.
Suffice to say that the diversity and
strong individual culture you feel
at Imperial is at least partly down to
the high numbers of international
students. As for our relationship with
Europe, I’d much rather work with
Europe to improve a union that has
brought peace to a continent that has
previously been characterised by war
and turmoil.
So who is left? The Liberal
Democrats? Well that’s how I voted,
but no doubt you have strong
opinions about their apparent
struggle to keep to their promises on
policies such as tuition fees or their
support of some unfair Conservative
policies – but that’s a coalition for
you. However, they aren’t going to
win the election – just maybe make
the others a little bit less shit.

Why I am not voting in this election

Anonymous: can’t wait until all these arguments are over
Honestly, the short answer is,
I no longer care. It feels like
months since every single
politician decided that doing the
job they are paid for (running the
country) was too much effort, and
decided to tell us why exactly they are
the best at doing the job they’re not
actually doing. If it was for a couple
of weeks, or maybe a month, I would
probably care enough to listen to
what everyone said but when it goes
on for this long, I just give up.
Social media is more of a thing
that ever before, which has led to
an over-saturation of all things
political. When I’m on YouTube,
I want to watch silly videos, not
see David Cameron advertising
the Conservatives. When I’m on
Facebook, I want to keep up with
what my friends are doing, not have
my entire newsfeed full of arguments
between people who are unlikely to
change their political opinions after
looking at a couple of pictures full of
cherry picked policies. I don’t have
Twitter, but I’m somehow still aware
of all the election related things going
on there too. Yes, some of them are
amusing, but all of it adds up.
The fact that I’m registered to vote
at my parents house doesn’t help
either. Travelling home just to vote is
way too much effort, and as I’m only
going to be living in my constituency
in London for a few more months, I
don’t see much point in voting there
either.
I might be more likely to vote if
it wasn’t for the fact that honestly,
I don’t feel like my vote counts for
much. There is no perfect way to
have democracy, but the first past
the post system feels like a way
to increase apathy, not decrease
it. Both of the places I could have
voted have historically had pretty
comfortable majorities for their
respective parties, so my single vote
would have basically no impact,
especially as if I had voted, I would
have just spoiled my ballot paper
anyway. Even in places without those
majorities, I’m not sure if anywhere
has ever had a general election come
down to one vote (and if I’m wrong
about this, feel free to correct me).
Though in practice it might not be
any better, at least with proportional
representation my vote directly
means something.
Yes, I probably should have voted,
yes I might well regret not voting
at some point in the next five years.
But truthfully right now I just don’t
want to think about it any more.
The newspaper coverage, the social
media presence, the never-ending
conversations all just make me want
to crawl into a hole and wait for it all
to be over.
After tonight it will all be over.
And I can’t wait.
