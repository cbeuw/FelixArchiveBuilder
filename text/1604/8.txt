Why you should have voted Labour

The Tories are the right choice
The last few years have taken
a real toll on Britain. The
coalition’s austerity agenda
has held our economy back, harmed
the most vulnerable, and made
our society more callous and self-
interested than at any time in the
last 30 years. The only way we can try
to sort this is to vote for the Labour
Party.
First and foremost we have to
think about what kind of society
we want to live in. Do you want to
live in a country where the disabled,
the sick, and the vulnerable are
vilified as “spongers” and a drain
on society, a country in which the
height of morality is looking after
Number 1 and the best policy is the
one that keeps cash in the pockets
of the well-to-do? The only way
to stop the Conservative Party
from spending another five years
destroying the NHS, the education
system, and the welfare system is to
vote Labour. While many on the left
disagree with Labour’s plans to cut
the deficit, their plans involve tens
of billions of pounds less in terms of
cuts to vital public services than the
Conservatives. The gap between the
two parties on this is colossal and
is vitally important to millions of
people across the country; if one more
vulnerable person with mental health
issues or a disability dies because of
the Conservatives’ savage cuts then a
vote for the most credible alternative,
the Labour Party, is more than
justified.
Secondly, a Labour government will
deliver a stronger economy. Taking
billions of pounds out of the economy
by cutting spending on welfare, on
schools, and on hospitals; on things
that result in investment going back
into the economy and people having
cash in their pockets to support
businesses has cost us all dearly.
Since the financial crisis in 2008
we have seen, under a Labour
government, an economic recovery
supported by considerate and well
thought out economic policies,
followed by a sharp and drawn
out recession caused by austerity.
Tracking GDP growth in the UK
against the USA shows a clear trend;
until 2010 both countries were
recovering from the global financial
crisis when the coalition government
made an ideologically motivated
move towards austerity, pulling the
rug out from underneath our society
and economy.
The result? Our economy contracts
while, across the pond, economic
growth continues. Over the next
Having been running
the Imperial College
Conservative Society for
about a year, I have met with many
students in Imperial College London,
and surprisingly, most of them claim
that they support the Conservative
Party. This has also been reflected on
the poll conducted by Felix. Today I
want to convince the rest of you that
Conservative is the best party to vote
for.
We are the only party with a
sensible economic policy. Look at
the alternatives: the Green Party,
raising minimum wage to £10, this
shows that they probably have no
idea what inflation is. Labour, their
policy is simple, banning poverty.
The rent prices are too high? They
will ban it from rising. Fuel and gas
are too expensive? They will ban it
from rising, too. If managing the
economy were so simple, Imperial
would not provide a masters degree in
Economics. Is UKIP any better? Their
entire policy is to exit the EU and cut
foreign aid.
The Conservatives want to cut
income tax, so people have incentive
to go to work and can keep more
of their income. We want to cut
corporation tax, so that there will be
more businesses with more jobs. We
believe that the economy is organic, it
only grows when the people inside are
prospering, working hard, producing
desirable goods and services, not by
the government artificially injecting
cash or creating less efficient public
sector jobs.
I do not want to flood you with any
more of Conservative Party policies,
as I am sure you have heard enough
from the media. One thing that
was not talked about enough is the
fundamental ideological difference
between the Conservatives and the
Labour Party. We believe in working
hard to achieve a better life for
yourself and your family, and we
believe in equality in opportunity
instead of outcome.
That is why all of our policies are
about rewarding those who go to
work. That is why we believe benefits
should only be given to those in
need, such as the disabled, not those
perfectly healthy 20 year-olds who
cannot be bothered to get a job.
We believe in allowing everyone
to achieve the maximum of their
potential, not to punish the brightest
so that we have a so-called “fair”
society.
Lastly, although I am tired of
hearing it, this is probably true. If
we do not have majority, we will
probably end up with a Labour-SNP
coalition; this means those who want
to break up our country would run
“a Labour
government
will deliver
a stronger
economy”
parliament the Conservatives would
hold our economy back even more by
using the excuse of pubic debt (which
pales into insignificance as a problem
compared to economic growth, but
that’s a story for another time) to
make more ideologically motivated,
deeper cuts which will set our
economy even further back and harm
the prosperity of us all, even people
who consider themselves the kind of
wealthy people who the Conservative
Party should be looking out for.
The only way to stop this, to get
our country back on the right track,
is to vote for the Labour Party. In
Ed Miliband we have a leader who
will bring honesty and integrity, and
assertiveness when it counts most, to
government. A vote for the Labour
Party is not a vote for a perfect
political party, but it is a vote for a
good one. A vote for a party that will
invest in the NHS, that will scrap
the bedroom tax, that will treat the
vulnerable in society with the dignity
they deserve. You don’t have to agree
with every one of their policies or
think that all of their candidates are
breathtakingly amazing to realise
that they are the only people who
can stop this country taking another
downward spiral for the next five
years.
I hope, for all of our sakes, that you
voted Labour yesterday.

Robert Zhou thinks that the Conservative Party is the best option
our country. I am sure this is not
something that you would like to see.
