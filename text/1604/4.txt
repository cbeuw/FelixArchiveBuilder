Athird year mathematics
student has been sentenced to
18 months in jail after 30,000
images of child pornography were
found on his laptop.
Nur Fitri Azmeer Nordin, 23, from
Malaysia, was caught by police with
his laptop open and next to a life-size
mannequin of a boy last November,
in his own home in Queensborough
Terrace, near Hyde Park.
He was also found guilty of making
and then distributing further
indecent images that have been
described by officers as “some of the
most extreme images that have ever
seen by officers that work in that
field”.
All devices were seized from the
property and searched, with many
of the files recovered considered
as Category A material, meaning it
depicted the most extreme forms of
abuse.
Nordin pleaded guilty to a total of
17 counts in front of the Southwark
Crown Court last Thursday, after
remaining in custody since his house
raid back in November.
Nordin pleaded guilty to one count
of possessing a total of 235 indecent
videos, and one count of possessing
a total of 921 of indecent images and
videos specifically of children.
He pleaded to two counts of making
images of children and four counts
of possessing images of children with
intent to distribute them further.
He also pleaded guilty to five counts
of taking indecent photographs of a
child.
Classmates reported that Nordin
“suddenly” disappeared during the
Autumn term and said they were
shocked when he reappeared in the
news earlier this week.
Said one on a Facebook post: “there
were no signs of odd behaviour, he
had a full attendance record and was a
top student. I couldn’t spot anything
wrong.”
They also told Felix since the
conviction has been made public: “He
had a good sense of humour... all in all
he was a great guy.
“I’m equally shocked as other
people to find out about his crime…
[but] hopefully he’ll get treated and I
hope for the best for him.”
Police were alerted to an internet
account in the area that was
downloading thousands of sexual
abuse images and videos. After
identifying the student, they raided
the property and found Nordin in his
bedroom in front of his laptop, sitting
next to the child mannequin.
DC Sara Keane, from the
Metropolitan’s Serious Crime
Unit said: “This appalling case
demonstrates the danger some
adults pose to young and vulnerable
children.
“Those who download this material,
and then distribute to others, are
fuelling the demand and creating yet
more defenceless victims.
“The Metropolitan Police works
tirelessly to bring those responsible
to justice and we urge anyone with
information about similar crimes to
come forward and speak to us.”
The Inspector-General of Police
(IGP) in Malaysia, Tan Sri Khalid
Abu Bakar, has said to Malaysian
press that the police do treat such
offences with serious concern, but
that: “Paedophilia is not so noticeable
a crime in this country but we do
monitor and take it seriously.”
According to UK news sources,
Nordin will serve 18 months in prison
in the UK, although immediately
after his release he will be deported
back to Malaysia. However, he may
be eligible for deportation after
completing only two thirds of his
sentence.
Despite this sentence, Malaysia’s
Ministry of Rural and Regional
Development has stated it is
considering appealing to the
Southwark Crown court in London to
get him out sooner.
The Malaysian Attorney-General
has refused to comment what
Nordin’s punishment would have
been if Nordin had been convicted in
his home country.
However, the Child Act 2001 in
Malaysia makes it an offence to
sexually abuse a child by forcing
them to take part in the creation of
pornography.
Those caught committing such an
offence is liable for a jail term of up
to ten years and a maximum fine of
RM20,000 (approximately £3,600),
or both, according to the Malay Mail
online.
Nordin was attending Imperial
on a Majlis Amanah Rakyat
(MARA) scholarship, meaning
that his tuition was paid for by a
Malaysian government agency
formed to support those from rural
backgrounds.
Upon his conviction, MARA has
since terminated his study allowance
and have stated that they will be
expecting him to pay the full sum of
