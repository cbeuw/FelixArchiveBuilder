Angus James Morrison inds The Virtues of Things to be a mixed bag
A new meta-opera arrives at the ROH
T
he Virtues of Things is a
chamber opera by the
sometime computer game
music composer Matt
Rogers, and his debut at the Royal
Opera House. It is performed by
the Aurora Orchestra, conducted by
Richard Baker, and directed by Bijan
Sheibani with a cast including last
year’s Figaro at the ENO, David Stout,
and the veteran mezzo-soprano,
Fiona Kimm.
Kimm and Stout play Ellipsis
and (the arrestingly-named) Selby
de Selby, the older generation of a
family of opera prop-makers, who
pride themselves on their traditional
values and methods. Their niece,
Peg – played by Robyn Allegra
Parton – is both the operatic trope of
a bored young daughter, ripe for the
saving by a dashing young nobleman/
soldier/penniless student, and the
first salvo of the coming barrage of
meta-commentary on the relevance
of opera in the modern age. Into
this bastion of self-righteousness
arrives a trendy young designer/
coder/penniless hipster, Eames,
played by the rather excellent tenor,
Paul Curievici. Hilarity ensues as
Eames’ offer to ‘upskill’ the de Selby’s
toolbox by “throwing some blue sky”
at the problem is met with Ellipsis’
icy “We are prop- makers, sir; we do
not peddle mere insinuations.” And
so on, in a rather wordy recitative
that leaves the audience glued to
the surtitles for fear of missing an
overwrought pun or cleverer-than-
thou reference, and thus failing to
laugh at the right moment.
Nevertheless, there are enough
giggles to be had from the sending up
of startup and self-help doublespeak
to keep you following along, and
enough of a snook cocked at the
ridiculousness of operatic logic and
High Art for you to flatter yourself
that you’re in on the joke. Soon
though, the librettist, Sally O’Reilly,
remembers that this is High Art after
all, and that in High Art it’s not good
enough to snigger at Very Serious
People of both the Middle Aged
and the Millennial variety, but it’s
important to make some Very Serious
Points yourself. In this case, it’s in the
form of some Alain de Botton-level
semiotics and an earnest discussion
of the essence (virtues?) of things.
Luckily, this is defused by Eames’
declaration that the most significant
woman in his life is his “life coach –
God rest her soul.”
That, unfortunately, is the high
water mark, and the rest of the
libretto is a straight-faced but
pantomimic (it’s behind you!) stagger
towards a final scene involving the de
Selbys’ death-by-meaning overload.
This happens in a set of their own
making, containing both the universe
and “the world of the atom”, which
serves mainly as a set-piece for the
lighting designer, Matt Haskins. As
the story becomes less funny, the
shortcomings of the orchestration
– either nondescript background
music, or intrusive and slightly out of
whack with the story – start to assert
themselves. High points remain,
mainly through Ellipsis’ descent
into madness (whose operatic logic I
won’t attempt to explain here), as she
takes over the dramatic mantle from
the early Peg-Eames interplay, but
not enough to overcome the distinct
impression – not quite dispelled by
Selby’s closing almost-aria – that this
was less an opera than a play with
music.
The Virtues of Things is the second
of three annual showcases of the
alumni of various Aldeburgh
Music development programs, in
conjunction with Opera North and
the Royal Opera. Last year’s offering
– two, short, debut acts from novice
composers – received (that old
chestnut) mixed reviews; the writing
and score were criticised for their
complexity and ambition, while the
cast and orchestra were praised for
making the most of what they had
to work with. This year, according to
the programme, the focus has shifted
to ‘rising stars’, with only O’Reilly
really being new to opera. The various
directors of Aldeburgh Music, the
Royal Opera, and Opera North thus
claim that The Virtues of Things
should not be seen as ‘artist training’,
but as “an opportunity to engage
audiences in the most innovative and
highest quality composition”. This is
a shame, as it comes off a lot better
in the former light than the latter:
Rogers’ score is certainly promising –
innovative, though not gratuitously
so – and the performances of all
of the cast, particularly Curievici,
are impressive, especially given
what’s asked of them. This sounds
an awful lot like last year’s verdict –
entertaining in parts, disappointing
in others, but a damned good show
for the first time around.
The Virtues of Things ran in the
Linbury Studio Theatre at the Royal
Opera House. It will now be performed
at Aldeburgh and Leeds.

"That is
sadly the
high water
mark and
the rest
of the
libretto is
a straight-
faced
stagger
towards
the final
scene."
"Rogers’
score
certainly is
promising
and all of
the cast is
impressive,

given what
is asked of
them."
