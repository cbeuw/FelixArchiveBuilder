Gut bacteria: a cause of obesity?

Nefeli Maria Skoufou Papoutsaki looks at the effect bacteria in our
digestive systems could have on our health
"Bacteria
make up
90% of the
cells in our
bodies."
The human body contains
a vast number of bacteria,
the majority of which are
beneficial to us. Some of them help
in the production of vitamins while
others help in the digestion of food.
This community of microbes, called
the microbiome, constitutes 90% of
the cells in our body. Recent research
has shown that the makeup of this
community in our digestive systems
can affect our metabolism and body
weight and is sometimes linked to
obesity.
Variation in the abundances of
different species of gut bacteria
is closely linked with lifestyle or
environmental factors. But a recent
study showed that this variation
may also be heritable. The group at
King’s College London compared the
microbiome of identical twins, who
share 100% of their genome, with that
of non-identical twins, who share on
average half of their genes.
They found that identical twins
have more similar microbiomes
than non-identical twins, suggesting
there is also a genetic factor in its
composition.
However, the most interesting part
about the microbiome is the potential
effect it may have on our eating
habits. Bacteria benefit from living
inside humans just as humans benefit
from the bacteria in our digestive
systems. But it could sometimes be in
the bacteria’s interest to manipulate
the behavior of their host to improve
the nutrients they receive. This can
be to our expense, if this is food with
many carbohydrates and fat since it
may cause obesity and other health
problems.
But how could bacteria manipulate
our behavior? In the absence of some
limiting nutrients bacteria produce
toxins, which might induce a negative
mood to lead humans to eat more.
They could also alter our senses so
that we like what is beneficial for
them.
Recent studies have linked the
inconsolable crying of infant colic
with changes in gut microbiota. The
tendency of parents when their baby
cries is to feed them so Colic may
increase the resource delivery to the
gut and hence microbial access to
nutrients. This may be the reason
why increase in weight is observed
after colic.
If we gain a more complete
understanding of the microbiome
and its effect on us we may be able
to reduce the cases of obesity or
other diseases linked with increased
consumption of food.
For example, microbiota
community structure changes
drastically within 24 hours of
changing diet or administration of
antibiotics.
Another way to resolve this
issue may be to inhibit a cell-to-
cell communication system of gut
bacteria, called quorum, since this
may be a way in which bacteria
coordinate to manipulate our eating
behaviours.
Also, administration of prebiotics,
non-digestable compounds that
stimulate the production of beneficial
microbes, has been linked with weight
loss in many studies, especially in the
case of prebiotic yoghurt.
The link between gut bacteria
and obesity remains poorly
understood, however, and many other
factors, such as lack of willpower,
environmental mismatch and
nutrient shortages, may be more
important. However, these factors
on their own may not be enough to
explain unhealthy eating.
This area of research has caught the
attention of many scientists who are
initiating projects that can generate
more solutions to the issue of the
microbiome and its link with obesity
and other diseases.
The British Gut Project, for
example, has been funded, in open
collaboration with the Department
of Twin Research at King’s College
London and the American Gut
Project, in order to understand the
bacterial diversity of the British Gut.
"The link
between
gut bacteria
and obesity
remains
poorly
understood."
In a galaxy far, far away...
This blue smudge is the most distant galaxy
ever discovered.
EGS-zs8-1,as it’s formally known,is a
staggering 13.1 billion light years away from
the earth. It’s also one of the oldest ever
observed,having formed just a few hundred
million years after the big bang.
The team behind the discovery,published
in AstrophysicalJournalLetters,used NASA’s
Hubble space telscope to identify the galaxy,
and measured how far away it is with data
from the Keck observatory in Hawaii.
Accurately measuring distances in
cosmology is surprisingly tricky,as it’s often
dificult to tell the difference between
galaxies that are dim and neaby and ones
that are bright and far away.
The distance to this new galaxy was
determined from the spectrum of light
it emits. Because of the expansion of the
universe,more distant galaxies are moving
away from the earth faster than those close
by. This causes the light they emit to be
shifted towards the red end of the spectrum
due to the Doppler effect.
According to Pascal Oesch,a postdoctoral
researcher at Yale and lead author of the new
study:“we have a lot of sources that we can
see with Hubble that are probably farther
away,but we cannot measure their exact
distance yet.”
The discovery gives us an important
glimpse of galaxy formation in the very early
universe.When the light we see now irst left
EGS-zs8-1,it was already around 15% of the
size of the Milky Way is now,and growing
around 80 times more rapidly.
The properties of these early galaxies are
very different to those we see today,and they
raise important questions for cosmologists
looking to understand the early universe.
