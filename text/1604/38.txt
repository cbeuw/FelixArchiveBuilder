Bridges
Bridges is played on a
rectangular grid with no
standard size. Some cells
start out with numbers
from 1 to 8 inclusive;
these are the islands.
The rest of the cells are
empty. The goal is to
connect all of the islands
into a single connected
group by drawing a series
of bridges between the
islands. The bridges must
follow certain criteria:
They must begin and
end at distinct islands,
travelling a straight
line in between; They
must not cross any
other bridges or islands;
They may only run
orthogonally; At most
two bridges connect
a pair of islands; and
The number of bridges
connected to each island
must match the number
on that island.
