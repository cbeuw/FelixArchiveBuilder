The Royal Albert Hall played
host to this year’s Postgraduate
Graduation ceremony on
Wednesday, seeing the largest ever
cohort of students cross the stage.
Three ceremonies took place
throughout the day, and over 7,000
guests attended to watch their friends
and relatives celebrate the completion
of their Masters or PhDs.
Nearly 3,000 graduads who
had studied science, engineering,
medicine and business were awarded
their postgraduate degrees, with
the event hosted by the President
of Imperial College, Professor Alice
Gast.
In her address, Gast highlighted the
bonds between those graduating and
wearing their purple gowns, and Sir
William Perkin, an English chemist
who discovered the first aniline dye,
mauveine. Perkin discovered the
purple dye accidently whilst studying
at the Royal College of Chemistry,
which is now part of Imperial College
London.
“The purple in the hoods you
and other Imperial graduates wear
were chosen because of Perkin. The
colour purple symbolises the spirit
of endeavour and discovery, and the
risk-taking nature that characterises
those with an Imperial education and
training.”
Ryan Browne from Chemistry,
Marily Nika from Computing, and
Aeneas Wiener and Jassel Majevadia,
both from Physics, received awards
for outstanding achievement.
The awards recognise the students’
contributions to both the College
and the wider community, including
for work in volunteering, outreach
and supporting and inspiring fellow
students.
Imperial College Medals were
awarded to Imperial’s Associate
Provost (Institutional Affairs)
Professor Stephen Richardson and
Professor Henry Rzepa, Emeritus
Professor of Computational
Chemistry, acknowledging the
outstanding contributions they have
made to the life and work of Imperial.
Honorary degrees were awarded
to Professor Frank Kelly, a Professor
of the Mathematics of Systems
and Master of Christ’s College
at the University of Cambridge,
and Imperial’s own Professor
Elizabeth Simpson to recognise her
contribution to transplantation
biology.
Two Professors from the National
Heart and Lung Institute, Professor
Miriam Moffatt and Professor Clare
Lloyd, received awards in recognition
of their postgraduate supervision,
whilst Dr Yujie Zhao from Chemical
Engineering received an award for
her work as a subwarden.
The Julia Higgins Medal was
awarded to Dr Liz Elvidge from
the Postdoc Development Centre
in recognition of her work towards
gender equality.
Those who have graduated on
Wednesday have now joined the
international network of over
170,000 alumni, which is supported
by more than 50 alumni associations
worldwide.
Imperial top University
for employment prospects
In the latest University ranking
table study produced by The
Complete University Guide,
Imperial took the top spot, being
declared the best University for
postgraduate employment prospects.
The College surpassed St George’s
(University of London), the
University of Oxford, the University
of Cambridge, University College
London and the London School of
Economics.
The Complete University Guide
survey indicated that 89.9% of
Imperial graduates found a job within
6 months after graduating.
The rankings use data from the
Higher Education Statistics Agency
(HESA), which records the number of
graduates who take up employment
or further study.
The report also emphasized the
importance of the research and
projects currently undertaken by
Imperial, such as the involvement in
the building of a dam in China, CCS
(carbon capture and storage) research
projects and the efforts to tackle
climate change.
The graduate prospects report was
one of many issued by the company,
with Imperial being cited as 3rd
best
University in the country in terms
of reputation and also the 3rd
hardest
University to get into.
Recent reports such as this one and
the QS World University Rankings
that ranked Imperial as the 2nd
best
University in the world, continue to
cement Imperial’s position as a world
leader in providing education and
research.
Commenting on the strength of
Imperial in light of the new rankings,
Professor Alice Gast, President of
Imperial College, highlighted the
importance of the competition
between different Universities to
contribute to society, but she also
mentioned how collaboration and
“joining forces” is crucial to innovate
and answer the future’s challenges.
With reports emphasizing the
global scope of Imperial’s projects and
research, with collaborations often
spanning 4 continents being the key
behind Imperial’s rising reputation as
a world-class institution.
With Imperial overtaking Oxford
and being joint 2nd
with Cambridge,
graduate prospects putting us
ahead of both, this is a testimony
to the College’s success since it’s
independence from the University of
London in 2007.

Anew room swapping system
will be put in place for the
next academic year, that will
allow first year students in Imperial
accommodation to move from one
room to another if they so wish.
The new scheme, proposed and put
in place by Chris Kaye, the Deputy
President (Welfare), was revealed in
his Imperial College Union paper last
week. The scheme was developed with
Kaye in conjunction with Imperial
College Campus Services.
The new system will allow students
to swap rooms within the same hall
with the consent of both parties
involved, and will be possible during
the first two weeks of the first term of
the academic year.
Students with specific welfare issues
may be able to move between halls
too, and Kaye told Felix that he hopes
that the scheme can be expanded to
allow more swaps between halls in the
future.
Kaye told Felix: “We are very happy
with this change and we think it will
benefit many students who aren’t
completely happy with their room
allocation for a number of reasons, be
they financial or otherwise.”
Every year there are often a swarm
of complaints online on various
freshers facebook groups after room
allocations take place before the start
of the year.
Kaye said that it is a regular
annoyance faced by students in the
way in which the rooms are allocated
in the first place; students currently
in halls are asked before they start for
five choices of room types that are
allocated equal preference.
“Hopefully this will alleviate some
of the worries students may have
before arriving at Imperial, and
ensures their student satisfaction is
given paramount concern.”
