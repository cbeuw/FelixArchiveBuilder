CANCER
VIRGO
This week you misunderstand
that it is only really women
that decrease in fertility and
subsequently ejaculate as
much of your sperm out as
possible to put into a fertility
clinic. Unfortunately when
you arrive, you are informed
that they do not take samples
stored in tupperware boxes.

This week you try to get
back together with your ex
by sending them a dick pic;
however you accidentally send
it to your lab partner.
Luckily they have now done
most of your group project and
have said nothing about the
weird lump on your dick that
looks like a face.
This week you are Hangman,
and your horoscopes writer
submits a horoscope that even
you think crosses the line.
You are fired by the Felix
Editor for “having standards”.
This week you are the writer
of the horoscopes in Felix and
upon reflection you realize
that there is an ever present
theme of inserting things
into orifices in this week’s
horoscopes. You wonder if it
has been a bit too long since
you got laid.
This week, unlike your peers,
you have no extra money but
are still horny due to exams so
you decide to improvise with
a cucumber; however the top
half snaps off inside your anus
and is permanently lodged
inside. At least you can now
say that the inside of your
rectum is cool as a cucumber
now.
This week you realize you
forgot to vote and so send a
package containing a cake
to say sorry and your vote to
Parliament; however your
sending of a mysteriously
bulky package results in the
police bursting into your room
with your laptop open with
pictures of Farage naked on it.
This week you start to develop
strange sexual dreams about
Arthur the aardvark due
to too much time spent in
biology lectures- the same
dream occurs every night, with
him calling you over and you
submitting to his demands
whilst Francine watches.
Perhaps sort yourself out.
This week in order to prevent
yourself from ever doing any
revision you decide to bulk
buy some couscous; however
a slight miscalculation leads
you to buying 10 kilograms.
Over the course of the next few
weeks you proceed to suffer
from the bulkiest shits known
to man leading to extensive
hemorrhoids.
This week due to you saving
a bit of money because
of the shorter term you
decide to treat yourself to a
rather luxurious vibrator.
The cockinator 3000 has
15 different functions of
vibration, made with the finest
silicone know to man, and 16
hour battery life. You call it
Keith.
This week you foolishly hope
that your vote will make a
difference in the Kensington
constituency; however you
forget that everyone here
would basically lick Cameron’s
balls if it meant less poor
people around.
This week you go to an
election night party with
various shots themed around
the different political parties.
You unfortunately drink too
many purple UKIP ones and
you start hurling abuse at the
Chinese students in the library,
leading to you being expelled.
This week you decide to snort
some Dip dab in order to thin
out your supplies.
It doesn’t give you any
particular hallucinations but
you have violently persistent
erections for the next couple of
days until you have to put an
Aero up your bum to cure it.
Diary Of a Fresher, aged 19 0/4
Friday 1st May
Didn’t write in the diary at all last week. Or over the Easter holidays. It just doesn’t feel the same since I had to
buy a new one. Thanks, Dorothy (the goat one).
Plus I had to focus on revision over the holidays - my exams are coming up soon, and I don’t know anything!
After everything that happened in ﬁrst term, and then the whole Dorothy (the human one) thing and then the
Dorothy (the goat one) thing, I haven’t had any time to do my work, and I missed half my lectures anyway. It’s all
gone a bit wrong, I think.
Saturday 2nd May
I wanted to get a seat in the library today, so I started queuing outside from 5am until it opened. I tried to some
revision outside to make the most of the time and get in the mood, but then it rained, so all my notes were
ruined. I had to spend the whole day remaking my old notes, so I didn’t get anything new done.
Sunday 3rd May
I stayed overnight in the library to try and catch up after my notes got wet, and now I’m really tired. I tried to
have a nap under my desk, but as soon as I got off my chair to lie down someone stole it off me. I had to move
to another seat after that. I hate the library.
Monday 4th May
It’s my ﬁrst exam tomorrow. I’m really nervous, apparently it counts for 3% of my mark this year. 3%! That’s loads.
If only I knew enough to actually pass I might actually stand a chance of getting a ﬁrst! I hate Imperial.
