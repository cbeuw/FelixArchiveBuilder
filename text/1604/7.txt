Investigation reveals “clear failings” during Varsity, Philippa Skett reports
Sport Imperial and College apologise
to Women’s Rugby team
The College has released
the investigation findings
surrounding Varsity 2015,
with Sport Imperial and the College
offering up apologies to the Women’s
Rugby team.
The investigation follows
allegations made by the Women’s
Rugby team that they were treated
unfairly compared to the men’s team,
who also played at the sporting event
at The Stoop, Twickenham.
The women’s team were left playing
to an empty stadium after coaches
were allowed to leave the stadium
early, which also resulted in leaving
some members of the team without a
way to get back to South Kensington
after the game.
They also reported abusive
behaviour from a member of Sport
Imperial staff, and several girls on the
team reporting that the same member
was heard over a walkie-talkie to say
“I don’t care how those fat girls get
home.”
The report found the team had
“been made a mockery of [and] had
not consistently not been given the
same level of consideration as their
male counterparts.”
Neil Mosley, Head of Sport
Imperial, has said: “Everyone
involved in organising Varsity is
deeply sorry that the experience at
the evening showcase fell so short
of what the athletes and attendees
deserved, particularly for the
Women’s Rugby Club.”
“The investigation has revealed
some clear failings and we need to
hold up our hands to these and take
time to address them properly – we’ll
be working closely with students and
Imperial College Union as we do this.”
Alice Gast, the President of
Imperial also has added her apologies:
“We wanted to let you know how very
sorry we are that your experience at
this year’s Varsity fell so far short of
the standards all of us would expect.
“It is unacceptable that talented
women in our community have
been made to feel like second-class
citizens.”
All complaints made by the team
were upheld or partially upheld,
although no evidence was found for
the alleged verbal abuse towards the
girls.
Despite this, the investigation did
find that there had been discourteous
behaviour from one member of
Sport Imperial staff, who the report
states will still be offering a personal
apology to those affected.
The investigation found that: “It
was accepted that the women’s rugby
match was marred by a series of
incidents and their experience on the
evening was different to that of their
male counterparts.”
The report also states that simply
“not enough thought” had been given
to numerous caveats of the event,
and that there was poor organisation
of transport and an error in
communicating these arrangements
to the women’s team.
The report states that the coaches
were allowed to leave early by the
Stoop staff due to “[concern] for the
safety of the spectators,” as there
was a build up of a crowd around the
exit of the stadium amidst rumours
that there were a reduced number
of coaches available to take people
home.
The report concluded: “that not
enough thought or understanding
was given to the specific needs of
the female players – who had never
played at the Stoop before.”
The investigation was conducted
by Jane Neary, Director of Campus
Services, and Kani Kamara, Equality
and Diversity Manager, and was
assisted by members of Imperial
College Union including Deputy
Presidents Abigail de Bruin and Chris
Kaye.
Actions have also been agreed
between Imperial College Union
and the College in response to the
investigation and the issues it has
raised.
These include commissioning
external academic research into
sexism in sport, and to also introduce
a new format for next year’s Varsity
so that “it focuses on all sports
equally.”
There will also be ban on the sale of
spirits on Varsity sites.
Mosley concluded: “Sport Imperial
is very fortunate to work every day
with a student community that’s
enthusiastic, engaged and diverse
in its sporting activities – and we’re
proud to provide a team and facilities
to support that community.
“I’m pleased that the investigation’s
findings encourage us to explore
how we can best support all sport
at Imperial and look forward to
collaborating with the Union as we
develop a single strategy for sport
here.”
Mona Theodoraki, Captain of the
team, said: “It was unfortunate the
way the events at Varsity played out,
however Imperial have dealt with
this very well and I’m happy to see
something good come out of this.”
“Not
enough
thought...
was given to
the specific
needs of
the female
players.”
“Talented
women have
been made
to feel like
second-class
citizens.”
