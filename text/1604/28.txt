Fred Fyles inds common ground between two very different shows
From the Renaissance to the Modern
T
he end of last month
saw the opening of two
exhibitions that delve into
the world of art history
and theory, taking a critical look at
the development, continuation, and
deconstruction of certain techniques
within the art world. At first glance,
the two couldn’t seem more different,
one dealing with renaissance
drawings and the other focussed on
modern photography. But scratch
beneath the surface, and they actually
share many things in common: an
appreciation of the production of
images, an exploration of their forms’
respective pasts, and an emphasis on
the importance of context within the
fine arts.
Firstly we have Renaissance
Modern, a collection of 16th
Century
drawings and prints selected from
The Courtauld Gallery’s collection;
on display in their new Gilbert and
Ildiko Butler Drawings Gallery, an
oasis of warm-wooded calm amongst
the Neoclassicist confines of the main
gallery, the exhibition takes a look at
how the renaissance idea of ‘modern’
was formed. A series of engravings
and drawn works form a visual essay
on the history of the era, during
which critical thinking about the
past began to truly interact with the
artistic world, setting the path the art
world would follow until Futurism
tried to free it from historical
bondage.
Certain themes crop up in the
display, showing us what modernism
meant to the Flemish, French, and
Italian artists featured. Collaboration
was a key development; the use of
prints meant that visual ideas could
be disseminated easily across the
continent. For example, Hendrick
Goltzius’ engraving of Spring is used
by another artist for their own work,
in which they add floral garlands
to Spring’s body, emphasising his
androgyny. The gallery is set up so
that these images follow one another,
giving us an immediate context for
the image.
Elsewhere, there is evidence of an
increased focus on narrative value,
with painters and artists mining
the rich seam of European liturgical
imagery for their allegorical works.
Details took on a new importance,
helping to convey the message
of the artist. Thus, Martin van
Heemskerck’s drawing of Magdalen
washing Christ’s feet features
Romanic architecture, further
blurring the line between modern
and ancient. Elsewhere, artists
turn to ancient tales like Ovid for
their inspiration. Technological
developments get a nod, such
as in Barocci’s study of Christ’s
circumcision, which features new
coloured chalks, but on the whole
the collection works as a paean to
the importance of line drawings.
Nowhere is this more evident than
Luca Cambiaso’s wonderfully
thrilling drawing of a cavalry battle;
composed of mere lines and squiggles,
it manages to convey the fury and
speed of warfare with a skill that
would be unmatched until Giacomo
Balla.
While many of the works were
composed as studies for larger oil
paintings, the quiet, unassuming
nature of the gallery allows us to fully
enjoy these small drawings, inviting
us to revel in their intimacy.
East London’s Whitechapel
Gallery hosts the next exhibition,
and the environs couldn’t be more
different. Their latest exhibition,
Christopher Williams: The Production
Line of Happiness, replaces their
summer extravaganza Adventures of
the Black Square, but upon entering
the space, it immediately appears
that they’ve forgotten to clean up.
Captions for the previous exhibition
remain on the walls, and the
introduction to Black Square is still
there, bisected by a large swathe of
green paper. However, this is all part
of the master plan of the exhibition,
billed as “an essay in photographs,
printed matter, dialogue, and walls”.
The third in a line of exhibitions
(previous ones were held in Chicago
and New York), The Production Line
of Happiness forms a wide-ranging
retrospective of this little-known
American photographer.
Taking inspiration from glossy
advertisements and the language
of the magazine image, William’s
work has a clear, non-expressionistic
quality, that makes it particularly
suited for close-viewing. He has stated
that the ideas of his work can be
found in “everyday culture, the news
kiosk”, and this is only emphasised
by the collection of images on
display; we close the show with a
series of images taken at a Japanese
photoshoot for a fashion magazine
– Williams went along, having been
given the technical specifications and
nothing else, to produce work that
was intentionally different to the
magazine’s work. What could be a
picture to be published in the corner
of the page, to be flipped over without
a second glance, enters into a gallery
space, and – with its low hanging –
invites us to consider what is meant
by art.
Williams is obsessed with the
technicalities of photography,
resulting in images that can serve
as cryptic messages on the state of
the camera. His technically precise
image of a dishwasher, for example,
which required painstaking set-up
to prevent colour bleeding, takes its
colour theme from that of the Alfa
Color film brand. Elsewhere, he takes
a 1968 Renault, and restages a scene
from the Paris uprising, minus the
people and the chaos. Instead we have
a contemplative shot of the car on its
side, its naturalistic lighting belying
its technical complexity – it’s his take
on Edward Weston.
Those of you who are by this point
rolling your eyes, bored of phrases
like ‘institutional critique’ and
‘redundancy as a field of freedom’,
might have a point. Williams’
work is rich in message, positively
overflowing with context, but the lack
of explanatory material (Williams’
work often has titles detailing all the
technical specifications, making them
too long to be printed – yet another
layer!) means that most of the work
can fly over your head, coming across
as self-indulgent. I would argue that
you should give this exhibition a
chance; there is an accompanying
publication which, if your bank
balance can handle a hit, is likely to
prove illuminating. There is magic
within the work, but it requires an
effort on the part of the viewer.
