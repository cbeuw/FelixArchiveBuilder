Fred Fyles applauds the physicality of this Russian Shakespeare
The Barbican’s Measure of Success
M
easure for Measure is
a Problem Play. This
is not a reflection on
the play’s quality, or
the beauty of its verse, but rather
an academic classification that
has been applied to the Bard’s first
Jacobean work. Not quite a tragedy,
but retaining too much seriousness
and darkness or a comedy, Measure for
Measure straddles a middle ground,
making it ripe for interpretation
and reinvention. And reinvention
is precisely what we get with Cheek
by Jowl’s version of the play, a
collaboration with Moscow’s Pushkin
Theatre that transports the rulers
from dukes to plutocrats, the time
from the Middle Ages to modernity,
and the language from English to
Russian.
Far from ironing out any of the
problems inherent within the play,
this production revels in the messy,
ambiguous nature of Shakespeare’s
work.
The play centres around Claudio
(Petr Rykov), who comes under fire
from Angelo (Andrei Kuzichev) for
getting his partner pregnant; Angelo
has been left in charge after the Duke
(Alexander Arsentyev) left the city
on what he claimed was a diplomatic
mission. But of course this wouldn’t
be a Shakespeare play without some
degree of subterfuge, and the Duke
has actually snuck back into the city
dressed as a friar, in order to observe
Angelo’s iron rule. Just in the nick
of time the Duke intervenes to save
Claudio’s life, returning to power on
a wave of good feeling that he himself
has created.
As you would expect with such
plays, there are a number of sub-
plots, and sub-sub-plots to follow,
but this production has radically
stripped most of that away, resulting
in a run-time of under two hours.
While some may decry this as a
defilement of the original text, it
actually means that we get to spend
most of the play focussing on Isabella,
a novice nun and sister to Claudio,
who appeals to Angelo to save her
brother’s life. Angelo agrees, but
only on the condition that Isabella
surrenders her puritanically-guarded
virginity to him. Isabella refuses, in
no uncertain terms: “Better it were a
brother died at once/Than a sister, by
redeeming him/Should die forever”.
An exploration of both sexual
neuroses and religious fanaticism, of
power and powerlessness, of woman’s
much-maligned place in the world,
Isabella is one of the most interesting
characters in Shakespeare’s work,
and Anna Khalilulina plays her with
astonishing power.
Encased in starched white gowns,
Khalilulina is simultaneously coy
and innocent; her frustration at
being a mere pawn in a world of
men is etched on her face, clear for
all the world to see. At points, she

seems a million miles away from the
traditional idea of a Shakespearean
woman, instead inhabiting the grand
dames of Greek tragedy: Elektra,
Medea, Antigone. Kuzichev is
similarly adept in the role of Angelo;
a character that can be played either
menacingly or comically. Kuzichev
opts for the former, imbuing his
character with an ice-cold personality
and a series of sexual hang-ups.
Where the play lets itself down is
the way the Russian translation is
handled. I am not trying to say that
Russian is an unattractive language,
but so much of Shakespeare’s power,
what makes it endure to this day, is
the astonishing beauty of the spoken
verse. The fact that they have surtitles
hanging above the stage (and – at
least for those near the front – at an
incredibly inconvenient angle for
viewing) is more of an annoyance
than a help: the translation flashes
so fast across the screen that most
of what is said is being lost, and by
the time you look back down you’ve
missed a majority of what the actors
are doing. It must be disconcerting,
for a play that is so heavily involved
with the idea of audience (the people
are audience to Claudio’s torment;
the Duke is audience to Angelo’s
tyranny), when the cast find that
most of theirs is staring at a space
three meters above the stage. A
much better idea would be, if not to
remove the surtitles completely, to
take a leaf from the Globe to Globe
campaign, which saw Shakespeare’s
Globe perform work in a multitude
of languages, and instead just
display a general overview of what is
happening in the plot.
However, once one has made
the decision not to pay attention
to the surtitles, it is possible to
truly appreciate the magic of the
stagecraft. And what stagecraft.
Cheek by Jowl, well known for
their dynamic performances, have
brought an immense energy to the
Barbican’s stage. Their simple setting
is dominated by five large red cubes,
between which the cast, clustered
together like a pack of wolves,
duck and dive; the various players
congregate, forming an intimidating
mass that spits out characters,
allowing them to perform their
scenes, before drawing them back
into their mass of hands and feet.
The climax of this staging comes with
the introduction of a double-bass,
which – aside from reminding me
of Kate Bush’s video for ‘Babooshka’
– signals the beginning of a waltz,
struck up by Claudio; from there we
have a whirlwind of activity, in which
the ‘Bed Trick’ – where Isabella is
switched for Mariana (Elmira Mirel),
unbeknownst to Angelo – is carried
out spectacularly. It is one of the most
engaging pieces of physical theatre I
have witnessed.
Of course, it would be amiss to
review a modern work coming out
of Russia without trying to make an
analysis of how it related to Putin’s
rule. Cheek by Jowl and the Pushkin
Theatre make it clear what they
think of modern Russia: Angelo is
a besuited tyrant, bringing the full
force of the law down on a single
individual in order to make a point,
but the Duke is no unambiguously
moral character either, manipulating
the orchestrations of the state to
come out on top, displaying his
benevolent mercy in front of a
beatific crowd. This production
of Measure for Measure takes the
mistreatment of a single citizen
as a starting point, looking at how
bureaucracy within Putin’s Russia
can be used to undermine and isolate
people; like Andrey Zvyagintsev’s
recent acclaimed film Leviathan,
Measure for Measure decries the power
of “man, proud man/drest in a little
brief authority”.
With such profound ideas going
around, it is a pity that awkward
surtitling should turn our attention
towards other things, and away from
the magic happening on the stage
right in front of us.
