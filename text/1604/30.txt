Fred Fyles mulls over the radical politics of the National Theatre’s play
While BBC News and the
pages of the Daily Mail
may seem the obvious
place for a bit of political debate,
currently there is a far more
interesting source of discursive
discussion: the stage. With plays
such as the Royal Court’s Hope, the
Tricycle’s Multitudes, and Donmar’s
The Vote all exploring the issue of
politics within modern Britain, it is
no wonder that incoming director
of the National Theatre Rufus Norris
describes the theatre as the nation’s
debating chamber.
As such, his decision to put on
Caryl Churchill’s play Light Shining
in Buckinghamshire, which deals with
the Levellers, a 17th
Century political
group, makes perfect sense. It is a
credit to both Churchill’s writing and
Lyndsey Turner’s direction that the
production seems as relevant today
as it did when it was first staged in
1976. So much has changed, and yet
so little.
A major difference in this
production is the scale of everything;
while the original run only had six
cast members, the National’s version
has a cast of at least 50, if not more,
resulting in a sense of epicness. This
helps to drive the plot along, imbuing
the rebellion with a real feeling of
consequence, but the problem is that
individual characters can sometimes
get lost in the general melee of
statesmen, soldiers, and religious
nutjobs.
The staging is similarly grand,
taking the form of a vast table,
around which officials in starched
black robes scribble down officious
notes; however, Es Devlin’s ingenious
set design means that the setting - in
the best possible way - threatens to
overshadow the cast.
As time goes on ornamentation is
removed from the table; what begins
as a vast feast eventually becomes a
plot of earth, emphasising the link
from farm to plate which, if it was not
lost then, is certainly lost in today’s
mentality.
Taking on a portion of British
history that is rarely visited – and it
is a shame, since it is truly fascinating
– Light Shining in Buckinghamshire
focuses on the build-up to the
English Civil War, following which
Oliver Cromwell took power, and its
immediate aftermath.
Many of those who fought in
the battle did so out of a sense of
frustration against the political status
quo of the day, and yet once the battle
was ‘won’ many found that things
carried on much as they were – same
shit, different clothing. Out of the
general antipathy against those in
power, a group called the Levellers
sprung into being.
Based on a foundation of legal
equanimity, religious tolerance, and
mass suffrage, the Levellers embodied
a sense of British political radicalism
that has continued to this day
(something that Turner makes clear:
the promotional material for the
play features a simulacrum of a trade
union banner, which are still being
made today).
We follow the Levellers on their
journey, from belligerent group of
individuals, to arguing factions at the
Putney Debates, to a group of proto-
Occupy agrarians, and finally to a
broken movement, crushed by those
at the top.
Light Shining in Buckinghamshire
is not a comprehensive history;
it eschews a formal narrative in
favour of highlighting the key
events, skipping between a few key
characters, which ensures it manages
to cover a dynamic period of history,
but does make it a little bit difficult
to follow.
This structure means that no single
character monopolises the attention,
but a couple of performances stand
out (no mean feat given the ensemble
cast): Ashley McGuire is by turns
humorous heartbreaking as the
vagrant Margaret Brotherton; and
Trystan Gravelle is excellent in
his role as the disillusioned soldier
Briggs.
A play that celebrates a period of
British history that could not be
further removed from St George
crosses and the naïvely bucolic view
of pastoral heritage that has been
sold to us by a Tory government,
Light Shining in Buckinghamshire is
a strong start for Norris’ tenancy,
especially considering the imposing
void left by Nicholas Hytner. A
timely celebration of the history of
British radicalism, a lineage that has
continued through the Suffragettes,
the trade unionists, and – one hopes
– the youth of today, this production,
with its canny direction, excellent set
design, and sharp script, is definitely
one to try and see.
Light Shining in Buckinghamshire is
running at the National Theatre until
22nd
June.
Tickets from £15; available online,
from the NT website.
