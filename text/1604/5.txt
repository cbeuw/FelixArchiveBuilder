money allocated to him back.
Nordin would have received
£22,950 a year for tuition costs, but
it is unknown if he was provided with
living allowance too.
However, a member of the MARA
council has since said that Nordin
“deserves a second chance,” and will
be welcome back to study at any
MARA institution upon his release.
Nazir Hussin Akhtar Hussin, one
of the MARA council members, has
said to Malaysian newspaper mStar,
a Malaysian news outlet: “We will
support him in any way possible to
help him rebuild his character and
one way is to give him a chance to
study in any MARA institution.”
“Any individual who repents
for a mistake should be given a
second chance after being punished,
especially among gifted students who
can become national assets.
with 30,000 child

ce, the road Nordin was a resident on. Nazir Hussain Akhtar Hussin, a member of
Malaysian news outlets are
discussing little else other than
Nordin’s conviction,with many
politicians,organisations and
prominent members of society
coming forward and giving their
views.
Many have taken to Twitter to
voice their disgust over a MARA
council member reportedly saying
that Nordin would be allowed to
continue studying in Malaysia upon
his return.
A petition has since been
launched named“Demand MARA
to stop giving a paedophile a
second chance,”which has amassed
over 5,800 signatures. The petition
asks:“since when is a paedophile a
national asset?”and also demands:
“How do we know that he did not
act on his fetish?”
The hashtag #NoSecondChance
was popular on twitter in Malaysia
earlier in the week.
Others have been discussing
the potential for Nordin to be
rehabilitated and released back
into the community,although most
are unhappy about the idea.
Noor Farida,the co-ordinator of
a group of Malaysian civil servants
released in a statement that Nordin
needs to receive“treatment”until
he has been“completely cured.”
“Otherwise,from mere
possession of paedophile porn,he
might graduate to physically acting
out his sexual fantasies and pose a
real danger to children,”she added.
“Nur Fitri Azmeer is obviously
a pervert and for MARA to make
excuses for his actions is totally
repugnant and unacceptable.
Sadly,MARA seems to have lost its
moral compass.”
Dr Hartini Zainudin,managing
director and one of the founders of
the Malaysian Yayasan Chow Kit,a
24-hour crisis centre for children,
said sexual predators have a
“disease that you don’t get cured
from.”
Zainudin said that much like
other addictions,sexual predators
need constant supervision and
counselling.
“Show me he’s repented,has
his emotions under control and
demonstrates that he’s done good
for the community,then we’ll talk?
In the meantime,he’s not coming
within ten feet of any child I know.”
Women’s Centre for Change
(WCC) advocacy oficer,Joshua
Teh,also pointed out that“There
are currently no laws which
makes it mandatory for such
offenders to undergo therapy
and rehabilitation,or for regular
therapy and monitoring once
they have been released from
imprisonment.
“Such provisions should be put
in place in order to allow for the
safe reintegration of persons who
have committed such offences into
society,”Teh said.
Protect and Save The Children,a
Malaysian organisation focussing
on the prevention,intervention and
treatment of sexual abuse towards
children,has also spoken to the
Malaysian press about the case.
The organisation’s President,
Datin Che Nariza Hajjar Hashim
said that Malaysia does not have
a“sound rehabilitation centre”for
sex offenders and paedophiles.
“We don’t have enough study
here on how they offended,when
they are a risk,to whom they are
a risk,the warning signs of risk to
support the police and probation
oficers to better manage them in
the community here in Malaysia.
We do not have specialised
expertise here in Malaysia,”she
told Malay Mail Online.
However,the Foreign Affairs
Minister for Malaysia,Datuk Seri
Anifah Aman said on Thursday that
he favoured setting up a public
register of convicted paedophiles,
that would hopefully act as a
deterrent.He also stressed that
those abroad should not feel that if
convicted,the government would
step in to save them.
“I wish to state unequivocally that
Malaysia views this matter gravely.
We do not condone these acts
particularly as they are considered
as crime against young children.
“I also wish to stress that
Malaysian students have a duty
to focus on their studies and to
uphold the good name and image
of the country.
“Malaysian students as well as
citizens are expected to abide by
the laws of the countries in which
they are domiciled.”
“He is a smart student and it would
be a waste not to help someone who
can be an asset to the country.”
A spokesperson from Imperial
College told Felix: “The College
confirms that Mr Nur Azmeer
Nordin was a third year mathematics
student.
Mr Nordin had been on
interruption of studies since
December 2014.
“On 30 April 2015 he was found
guilty of a number of charges relating
to images of child abuse.
“The College has terminated the
student’s registration in line with
the relevant policy and he is not
permitted to return.”
Nordin graduated in 2009 from
a residential school in the State of
Perak, Malaysia, before commencing
his studies at Imperial in October
2012.
