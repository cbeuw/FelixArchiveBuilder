privilege to
introduce
Sarah Porter
Waterbury to
the Imperial
community."
"We
have the
ambition
to discover,
lead and
innovate
on a
grander
scale."
in the UK, people are accustomed
to seeing the government as the
principal supporter of higher
education and may not feel a personal
responsibility in ensuring that
Britain’s fantastic, world-renowned
Universities continue to operate at a
high level,” says Mrs Waterbury.
“By contrast, in the US, everybody
understands that Universities need
philanthropic support – both the
private and the public Universities”.
After growing up in Latin America
and the Caribbean, Mrs Waterbury
graduated from Princeton University
with a BA in History.
She developed broad international
experience through working in
private banking and development in
Asia and the Middle East. “People are
people, the world over, and people
like to give to people,” she says. “It’s
just wonderful to see that kind of
generosity”.
“Ultimately we’re trying to
showcase the university to the right
audiences, whether it’s people or
organisations that can help us with
our financial and resource needs or
recommend us to prospective staff
and students and tell them what a
great place it is to work and study”.
Imperial College President

appointment, “It is a privilege to
introduce Sarah Porter Waterbury to
the Imperial community.”

found someone with Sarah’s
experience, talent and vision. She is
one of the outstanding advancement
professionals in the world.”

our community and as somebody
who can grow and build our culture of
philanthropy”. Professor Gast added,
“We have the ambition to discover,
lead and innovate on a grander scale.
Sarah will play an integral role in this
growth”.

Mrs Waterbury said, “It is an honour
to join Imperial College London,
one of the world’s great Universities.
Above all, Imperial stands for
academic excellence that has an
impact on society – these two factors
serve as a beacon for its supporters,
and for me.”
“I look forward to joining Imperial’s
phenomenal community of staff,
students and alumni as we work to
excite and inspire supporters and
would-be supporters of Imperial’s
impactful research and education
activities”.
