Lib Dems will deliver a fair society
One of the biggest things
I’ve noticed as secretary of
the newly formed Liberal
Democrat Society this year is that
students have very mixed and
often strong opinions of the Liberal
Democrats. I’m hoping to shine a
light on why I voted for the Liberal
Democrats on 7th
May.
It would be silly not to address
tuition fees first. Despite the
controversy, I genuinely believe that
no Liberal Democrat in Parliament
wanted to support the Tories in
raising tuition fees. Despite this,
they fought hard to get the best deal
possible for students, introducing
a progressive loan system that has
resulted in graduates actually paying
less per month than they would have
before.
The mood among the party and
its supporters is that the coalition
has been a success thanks to the
Lib Dems; they had the chance to
pass legislation directly from their
manifesto and also fought tooth and
nail to block some of the Tories’ crazy
policies. The Liberal Democrats have
achieved all of these remarkable
things despite winning less than 9%
of the seats in Parliament, something
no smaller party has achieved in
recent history.
In this election, the Liberal
Democrats put forward a manifesto
that I think was the best of the lot.
It put a strong emphasis on mental
health, something close to many
students’ hearts. They promised to
deliver equal treatment of mental
and physical health in the NHS. In
the last Parliament the NHS budget
increased in real terms every year and
Nick Clegg has promised to deliver
the extra £8 billion a year England’s
NHS needs, according to the Chief
Executive of NHS England.
On Education, the Lib Dems have
done great work, and Nick Clegg has
pledged to protect the education
budget from nursery to 19, with
the ambition of eradicating child
illiteracy in the United Kingdom by
2025.
The Lib Dems also want to shift
tax away from work and towards
unearned wealth, to allow workers
to keep more of what they earn and
create a more equal society. The
Liberal Democrats also want to
introduce a mansion tax and clamp
down on tax avoidance in the next
five years.
Freedom and equality is also
high up on the Lib Dem agenda. In
the last government they blocked
the Tory ‘Snooper’s Charter’ which
threatened online privacy, and want
to take this further in the next one by
introducing a Digital Bill of Rights
to safeguard people’s privacy online.
They also plan to tackle homophobic
and transphobic bullying in schools
and professional sports, force
companies to publish the salary
disparity between men and women,
and employ more Black, Asian and
Minority Ethnic police officers.
By time you’re reading this, the
votes will have been counted and
chances are coalition discussions are
taking/have taken place. The Liberal
Democrats have proven themselves to
be a strong, sensible coalition partner
and plan on being one again in the
next government. They won’t let
Labour borrow too much, and they
won’t let the Tories cut too much; as
Nick Clegg put it, “We’d give a heart
to a Tory government and a brain to
a Labour one”. Last week Nick Clegg
announced that the Lib Dems will not
enter coalition with Labour or the
Conservatives unless they promise
to increase education funding and to
introduce a stability budget within
50 days of forming a government to
balance the books fairly and quickly.
With the recent rise of smaller
Jamie Thomas believes in the achievements of the minority party
parties from both ends of the political
spectrum, the Lib Dems are the
only party committed to keeping
the country firmly and sensibly in
the centre. They are the party most
committed to building a stronger
economy and a fairer society; this is
why I voted Lib Dem on the 7th
May.
