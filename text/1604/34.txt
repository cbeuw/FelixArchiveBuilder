34 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX
08.05.2015
HANGMAN hangman@imperial.ac.uk
Today, Hangman can exclusively
reveal the presence of a shadowy
cabal operating at the highest level of
Imperial College.
An extensive undercover
investigation by Hangman uncovered
the “Imperial West Syndicate”, a
small group responsible for the recent
trend in moving Imperial activities
away from their South Kensington
home.
To our surprise, the existence of
the Syndicate has been left on the
main Imperial College website, in full
view of any unsuspecting member
of the public should they happen
to be scrolling the pages on College
Governance.
Hangman was innocently perusing
these pages when we stumbled across
a document that was clearly intended
to be for the eyes of top staff only.
In the document, a “Committee
Structure” diagram shows the
existence of the Syndicate, with no
further explanation of their role or
powers.
The mystery only deepened when
Hangman climbed further into the
rabbit hole, discovering that the
Syndicate are responsible for “major
spending decisions.”
Hangman attempted to contact the
Syndicate for comment, but was told
“this is a university, not the bloody
Illuminati, you idiot.” More to follow.
Thanks to the infamous time
travelling investigative journalists
that we keep in our basement,
Hangman can now reveal that in fact
more Imperial students voted in the
Student Union Big Election, than in
the most recent general election.
42.47% of Imperial students
participated in the Union elections
whilst only 15.6% actually voted for
the election that contributes to the
future of the country.
Union representative, Malex
McKay, was the first person we
spoke to about these results to which
he had this to say: “It’s not a big
surprise really- Imperial students
are very passionate about choosing
the person who will disappoint them
consistently and lick the college’s
arsehole, whereas in Kensington it
doesn’t really matter what you do
because the Conservatives have made
this constituency its bitch”.
Wondering if Malex’s views
represented those of the student
population of Imperial, we set upon
poking students in the library awake
so that they would answer our
questions.
One sleepy student said that the
lack of incentive stopped them from
bothering with the real election:
“With ICU they like offer us iPads if
In response to claims that recent
reporting in Felix has lead to damage
to the Sport Imperial brand (and
the reputation thereof), Hangman
has launched a brand new social
media campaign in defence of Sport
Imperial.
#JeSuisSportImperial goes live on
Twitter today, and will, according to
one Hangman source, “hopefully go
viral within five minutes, which is
faster than even the Millifandom.”
However, the campaign launch
didn’t immediately go to plan, as
proetestors ran into difficulties in
Hyde Park.
A protest in support of Sport
Imperial was planned to take place
last week, but unfortunately the
organisers failed to notice that their
scheduled time clashed with a protest
over the ‘Are you Beach Body Ready’
advertising campaign.
After some confusion over how
both protests came to be in the
same place at the same time, a fight
reportedly broke out between the
protestors.
The fight started after one of
the pro-Sport Imperial protestors
allegedly told one of the beach body
protestors that they looked “a little
fat” and should “try doing some
squats” to help shed their body fat.
In the scuffle that followed,
members of both protests were seen
throwing punches.
The fight came to a close when
the beach body protestors conceded
defeat, and told the Sport Imperial
protestors they were “going home.”
To this, the Sport Imperial protestors
allegedly replied “we don’t care.”
After the protest had turned ugly,
Hangman spoke to Mr H. Angman,
who was protesting on behalf of Sport
Imperial. Mr Angman told us that “it
obviously wasn’t the most ausipicious
start to proceedings.
“We went there to protest about
how Felix has ruined Sport Imperial’s
good name, just because the women’s
rugby team didn’t know how to book
their own coach.”
Most protestors echoed Mr
Angman’s comments, with one
(who asked to remain anonymous)
claiming that the fight started
because “these fat girls started saying
we were supporting a bunch of
misogynists, and we couldn’t let them
get away with that.
“Not after those wankers at Felix
called them misogynists, anyway.”
The protests come after Felix
famously caused an outcry over
what is now being called “Farsity”,
where various bad things happened
to various people but it’s all been
resolved now so let’s just gloss over it.
Hangman reached out to the Felix
Editor for a comment, but were yet to
receive a (printable) response before
going to print. which shows how
much she cares..
This issue of Hangman has been
brought to you thanks to the kind
generosity of a donor who asked to be
named only as “S I”.

News in Brief: Hangman is beach body ready
we go vote whereas the government
always says that they’ll just think
about lowering tuition fees and they
just spend the rest of their term
wanking.
“Also ICU is getting Professor
Green to come to the Summer Ball- i
heard that he hit a guy in Durham”.
Another student emphasised his
apathy due to the fact that the main
parties had nothing that he could
relate to: “I don’t see the point in
voting because to be fair after i do
the mongol rally and find myself
in Thailand i’m gonna work for
Goldman Sachs which means that i
basically will own politicians.
“I think i’m going to buy a
thoroughbred eton one.”
He again emphasized the fact the
disillusionment in the fact no real
difference was made by the parties:
“Chris Kaye promised us fresh
pizza bases which he can actually
deliver on, but an end to zero hours
contracts? I don’t think so mate”.
There was, however, a hint of
optimism from a biology undergrad
Daisy Doran-Bown who actually did
go and vote: “ I really enjoyed voting-
it was well exciting! I voted for the
Green Party because i really like how
they love the earth and say no to
nuclear because it’s not like we even
use it”.
We then asked if she agreed with
the Green party policy of limiting
jail sentences for women who only
commit seriously violent crimes.
(Editor’s note: this is actually one of
their policies. The more you know.)
She replied “Oh i didn’t actually
read their manifesto thing. I just
heard they were going to legalize
weed and it sounded good to me.”
There were also a surprising
number of international
commonwealth students on UKIP’s
electoral register.
When we asked Pei-Wen from
Chemical Engineering why she
voted for a party adamant on closing
Britain’s borders, she replied that
it had been a very well informed
decision.
“I took the Buzzfeed’s ‘which
UK party leader are you?’ test and
I received 96% chance I was Nigel
Farage and I guess since Buzzfeed is
run by journalists, the results have got
to be true”.
What is definitely certain is that
until we have a party leader with as
dashing blonde locks as Lucinda or
Luke, Imperial suffrage will remain
low.
But not, Hangman hastens to add,
as low as British suffrage.
