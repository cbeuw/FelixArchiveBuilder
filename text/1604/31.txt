An American Lost in the Wilderness
Fred Fyles inds that the balance is slightly off at the Young Vic
For her production of Eugene
O’Neill’s Ah, Wilderness!
director Natalie Abrahami,
who returns to the Young Vic after
her success of Happy Days, seems to
have taken the title rather literally.
Wilderness invades the quiet
Connecticut home at the heart of
the tale, both metaphorically and
literally; the sands of time take on a
physical quality, pouring in through
the open doors, and obscuring the
humble family home in a miasma
of uncertainty. An effective staging
device it may be, but the overall
effect is to create a play that is all too
cerebral when compared to the warm
script.
O’Neill’s only comedy, written just
three years before he won the Nobel
Prize for literature, Ah, Wilderness!
takes its name from a refrain of the
Persian poem, The Rubáiyát of Omar
Khayyám, which is among a selection
of works adored by the central
character Richard Miller (George
MacKay) – a headstrong, volatile high
schooler going through the pains of
young love and reckless rebellion.
Set on the Fourth of July, 1906, Ah,
Wilderness! shows the bittersweet
nature of youth, and acts as a
meditation on the nature of memory,
but above all serves as a warm family
drama, in which comedy by far
outweighs the tragic elements.
At least, that is the impression one
gets from the script. For the Young
Vic’s production there seems to have
been a decision to take a more serious
route, portentously emphasising
the unhappiness of O’Neill’s life;
Ah, Wilderness! becomes much more
about the inner turmoil of the writer,
rather than an exploration of family
life and relationships.
While the relationship Richard
has with his parents, Nat (Martin
Marquez) and Essie (Janie Dee), is
firm but nurturing, O’Neill’s actual
childhood was far from happy:
“unwanted, no love or tenderness,
no care, no protection!” wrote his
widow, Carlotta Monterey, following
his death. And thus, Ah, Wilderness! is
transformed into a heavy melodrama,
in which the older Richard (played
by David Annen, in what is clearly
meant to be an imitation of the
older O’Neill, who by this point had
turned to the bottle) surveys every
scene, occasionally commenting or
giving stage directions. This addition
isn’t quite intrusive, but is never
not noticeable – Annen floats on
the peripheries, dancing around the
action at the centre, in a role that adds
little to the overall production.
Judging from her last production
– Happy Days, in which Juliet
Stevenson is buried up to her neck
in dirt – Abrahami seems to have a
thing for the earth, a reputation that
is only confirmed by the expanse
of sand that covers the stage. A
collaboration with designer Dick
Bird, this intervention generally
works very well, creating a strange
new landscape, through which the
characters traverse unsteadily, and
adding another layer of meaning to
the foundation of the script.
However, there are moments when
it doesn’t quite come together - the
scene at the ‘house of sin’ for instance,
where Richard goes after being
spurned by his young lover, resembles
more a nightclub than a speakeasy,
and is jarring to say the least.
However, there are also moments of
sheer magic within the setting, and
the final act is really something to
behold.
With such an attempt to add in
high drama to what should be a
comedy tinged with melancholy, Ah,
Wilderness! runs the risk of turning
into a stony Ibsenesque production,
or perhaps a Chekhovian melodrama.
However, the lightness and vivacity
of the acting talent saves the day;
MacKay, fresh from his cinematic
turn in Pride, is impressive as Richard,
imbuing the character with a fiery
heart and a self-assured exterior
that belies the romantic within. Dee
is excellent as his long-suffering
mother, proving that maternal love is
limitlessly extensible, as is Susannah
Wise, who plays Aunt Lily, trapped
between her love for Sid Davis
(Dominic Rowan, who fills the role
with aplomb) and her hatred for his
drinking.
While the staging and the
direction may tend to sand off the
edge of humour and deaden the
comedic lightness, this production
of Ah, Wilderness! still manages to
be entertaining, proving that – no
matter what happens – the brilliance
of O’Neill’s writing will still shine
through. Abrahami and Bird should
be congratulated for their radical
interpretation of the play, which is
certainly creative and new, but the
real congratulations should go to the
faultless ensemble cast, who show us
that wilderness can be paradise.
Ah, Wilderness! is on at the Young Vic
until 23rd
May.
