Join the #helloicu for 2015!
October sees the return of thousands of new students and we need your help to give them the best welcome possible!
We are looking for people to join the #helloicu crew, to share your experiences and offer advice that will help relieve any
nerves and concerns.
The #helloicu crew have an important role in making sure new students get settled into life at Imperial. Being part of
#helloicu crew is not only great fun but gives you the chance to meet new people and help create memories to last a
lifetime!
This will be our third year of running #helloicu crew and we want it to be bigger and better than ever before! This is what
#helloicu crew had to say about their experience last year:
A100% said the experience boosted their confidence
A90% said they learnt and developed new skills
A100% made new friends from different courses and study years
A100% would recommend the experience to a friend.
Get involved in a range of Welcome Week events that fit around your timetable and interests and make it a week to
remember! Find out more and sign up at imperialcollegeunion.org/helloicu.
