"Despite
the

text, Blood
somehow
manages to
be moving"
Just when we thought there
couldn’t possibly be another
Romeo and Juliet reinterpretation,
the Tamasha Theatre Company
chipped in with their own modern
tale of star-crossed lovers (can’t talk
about that play without saying the
word star-crossed folks, it’s a legal
requirement for reviewing). After all,
reinterpretations are all about the
retelling of classic story in a way a
modern audience can relate to, right?
So Emteaz Hussain wrote Blood – as
she herself puts it, “a contemporary
urban love story” of two British
Muslims, Caneze and Sully, fighting
their family ties for the sake of
love. The result is a play even more
removed from a modern audience
than the 16th
century one it’s inspired
by.
The text oscillates between forced
poetical lyricism and overeager
bradistani dialect – think wannabe
Shakespeare, but down with kids. The
drama revolves round the stereotyped
lives of young, northern, working
class Muslims, surrounded by gang
warfare, matchmaking aunts, and
discrimination.
For someone like your reviewer,
only recently out of teenagehood, the
adolescent love scenes are cringingly
mumsy: he raps about his love to her
(raps! He actually raps, I kid you not),
she wears his jacket to school, and
they have an illicit picnic in her room
one night. More than a retelling of
Romeo and Juliet, Blood had all the look
of being a middle class and middle
aged idea of what a gritty version of
High School Musical would be.
As far as the text is concerned,
Blood is absolutely irredeemable;
the dialogue will make you squirm
from start to finish, the jarring “innit
bruv”s clashing with the predictable,
pseudo-dramatic repetition of bad
poetry.
Yet, miraculously, despite the
relentlessly awkward text, Blood
managed to be a decent and almost
moving production. With the
exception of film stars taking the
stage, going to the theatre normally
equates to going for the play alone.
Generally, one goes for the
performance and not for the actors;
the plays themselves get reenacted,
redirected, reinvented. A good play
can be ruined by bad actors, but
it will find another life in a more
competent cast. In this case however,
the production was saved by two
startlingly good actors. Krupa Pattani
and Adam Samuel-Bal convey enough
youthful passion and teenage angst
to transform Caneze and Sully’s lines
into something meaningful. They are
good enough to allow the audience
to almost forget the clunky text,
transporting them along on the wave
of emotions.
Starting off a bit shaky (the accents
was a bit touch and go) the pair
grow into their roles throughout
the play and, in doing so, take you
with them. They transform from
one dimensional stereotypes of
teenagers to almost-believable, fully
rounded people, overcoming the huge
hurdle posed by the often unnatural-
sounding lines they are hampered
with.
Adam Samuel-Bal gives a goofy
spin to his character, breaking up the
forced drama with some genuinely
funny moments. The two, as well
as acting their own part, also act
out the other characters through
their recollections. The whole play
is recounted by them, a flashback
that enables them to relive their
story. Samuel-Bal’s impression of a
pushy Pakistani aunt is priceless, as
he jumps from one side of the table
to the other, acting out both parts
of the dialogue. Krupa Pattani is
exceptionally good at evoking other
characters; she switches from her
slightly petulant feminine character
to a gang-leader bully boy effortlessly.
In one scene she tells of how her
family-imposed fiancé comes over
with a copy of Asian Bride, showing
off about how opulent their wedding
will be. Using nothing more than
mere body language, she conjures up
a muscular, small-town henchman.
In another, she shows both sides of
a rape scene with startling efficacy.
Both the actors and the director,
Esther Richardson, are responsible
for the success of these scenes, as
the minimal props on the stage
allow a cast of two to populate a
world filled with family, employers,
fellow students and colleagues. Arun
Ghosh’s electronic score is also worth
a mention, as it underlines the clash
between the lightness of Sunny and
Caneze’s love and the oppression of
their cultural restrictions.
All in all, Blood is an unusual
example of actors so good that they
redeem a truly execrable play. Or
maybe it’s an example of a play
so unutterably bad that even two
energetic and talented young actors
can’t make you forget quite how
predictable and jarring the text
actually is...
Blood is on at Soho Theatre until 16th
May. Ticket from £12, available online.
