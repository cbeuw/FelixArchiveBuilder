A Surreal Counter-Capitalist Argument

Using animation, live music,
physical theatre, and
stand-up comic timing,
Golem is less your standard play and
more a cabaret spectacle. Despite
a slightly weaker plot than hoped,
Golem’s message about corporate
greed and human idleness is
poignantly addressed by its technical
achievements. With stunningly
beautiful visuals, an incredible
soundtrack, and a remarkable
attention to detail, theatre company
1927 present a truly unforgettable
psychedelic nightmare – Golem is
quite simply an artistic masterpiece.
Living in the nameless dystopian
parallel of a European metropolis,
the Robertson family are shy, geeky,
and wildly unpopular. Having
been abandoned by their parents,
Annie and Robert live with their
grandmother. Both are part of
the punk band “Annie and the
Underdogs”, despite being too shy to
actually perform in public. With dull
and uninteresting lives, Robert works
in an equally dull job: “backing up the
back-up” by writing out all the ones
and zeros by hand. But Robert does
have one friend, a genius inventor
who, having invented a whole range
of junk, finally comes up with his
killer invention: the Golem, an
autonomous clay man to serve his
master’s every whim.
A critique of man’s desire to have
everything they want, the Golem
symbolises corporate control over
The members of the English
Touring Theatre assemble
in the Barbican’s theatre for
their production of A Mad World My
Masters, and there is an elephant in
the room. Based on the 1605 work
by Jacobean playwright Thomas
Middleton, this production of A Mad
World My Masters has been transposed
from the metropolis of 17th
century
London to the vice-filled streets of
1950’s Soho. Of course, with such a
construct, one is almost obliged to
consider the National Theatre’s
hugely successful production of One
Man, Two Guvnors, in which James
Corden filled the main role; with a
traditional source material updated
to a nostalgia-tinged vision of the
recent past, an emphasis on slapstick
comedy, and a huge amount of
bawdy humour, the comparison is
inevitable. Sadly, A Mad World My
Masters is a disappointment; maybe I
am holding it to too high standards,
but the whole thing is about as funny
as an am-dram production, put on in
a village hall.
With its seedy brothels and
wandering ‘ello-‘ello style policemen,
mid-century Soho does form a fitting
backdrop for the action of A Mad
World My Masters, which – like most
Jacobean plays – features a number of
intertwining plotlines.
The main one centres around
Dick Follywit (Joe Bannister), who
aims to squeeze as much money out
of his stingy uncle, Sir Bounteous
Peersucker (Ian Redford), as he can.
Along the way we are introduced
to Mr and Mrs Littledick – the
Jacobeans were anything but subtle
– played by Ben Deery and Ellie
Beavan respectively, an unhappily
married couple; he is overprotective
and jealous, she longs for the self-
flagellating pimp Pertinent Brothel
(Dennis Herdman).
The cast all do a great job in their
respective roles, with many imbuing
them with a great deal of physicality
and verve.
Sarah Ridgeway is brilliant as the
prostitute Truly Kidman, whose
mother has managed to convince
the lads of Soho that her daughter’s
virginity is intact. Ridgeway’s lines
provide some of the only truly
pertinent humour of the play,
whether it be exposing the class
divisions that accents reveal, or
exploiting the foibles of men, making
her way in a patriarchal society.
The pity is that this is as deep as the
humour goes. For the most part, the
brand of comedy is similar to that
you would find in a Blackpool music

the masses: the effect of capitalism
on our actions, opinions, and
appearance. The show’s set – born out
of animation – forms a continually
transforming backdrop, unparalleled
in its ability to wonderfully and
simply convey the surreal nature
of the setting. With the actors
seamlessly interacting with the
animation, and with the projections
never feeling out of place or poorly
thought out, the achievements of
this show are almost a little hard to
believe.
I don’t really want to pick out
the work of the individual actors,
since the cast is exceptional, but one
moment in particular did strike me;
hall around 50 years ago. It’s all very
much Carry On..., wink-wink-nudge-
nudge, postcard humour that went
out of fashion long ago. Perhaps it
is no surprise that those laughing
the loudest came from a sea of silver
hair, who were probably alive during
the time this type of humour was
popular, and can therefore look at it
with gentle appreciation.
But then maybe it’s just me; I will
freely admit that such jokes just don’t
sit well with me. If you’re a fan of
sexual innuendo, Barbara-Windsor-
style winking to the audience, and
play-on-words involving phrases like
‘cunning stunts’, then perhaps A Mad
World My Masters is the play for you;
as for me, I think it should leave with
the tide.
A Mad World My Masters is on at the
Barbican Centre until 9th
May. Tickets
from £10, available online
Shamira Turner as Robert spends
a hefty part of the show walking
from location to location; but with
nowhere really to go, the effect of
rushing through a city is achieved
by a rhythmic stationary movement
against a panning animated
background. My words don’t really do
it justice. It was simply extraordinary.
Created by 1927, Golem is written
and directed by Suzanna Andrade
with film, animation, and design by
Paul Barritt.
The performances are sharp and
entertaining, but there is little depth
to the story. That being said, little is
needed to convey their point. Reading
part of an interview with Barritt in
the programme, the sentiment of his
work is clear:
“Does this mean your basic narrative
is that any decent idea will inevitably be
destroyed by capitalism?”
“Yes.”
Whether he’s right or not I don’t
know, but it’s always intriguing when
an anti-capitalists perform their
work in the West End – a corporate
powerhouse if ever there was one.
Fair enough for Barritt, the show
needs to be staged somewhere, but
it makes taking a message away that
little bit harder.
Golem is on at Trafalgar Studios until
22nd
May. Tickets from £10. Available
