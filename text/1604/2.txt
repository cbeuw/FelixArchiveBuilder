I’m writing this as the first exit
polls are rolling in, and am
planning to stay up as late as I can
to watch the rest of the results. The
general election has been exciting
to follow, if not for pure online
hilarity if nothing else. The rise of the
milifandom has shown that if you put
your mind to it, anything can become
a viral sensation if you photoshop
hard enough.
The general election itself,
even with its faults, is still a great
demonstration of democracy, and
indeed is something we should be
proud of. However, what really
has impressed me is the online
engagement this general election
has managed to invoke, something
that was not really present in the last
general election back in 2010.
This engagement has been
particularly strong in the younger
generation, the one that often is
associated with political apathy.
The last general election took
place whilst social media was still
in its infancy, but now we are able
to share our feelings and thoughts
at a moment’s notice and join with
millions of more people doing the
same.
The rise of social media and the part
we have played as a young generation
can in fact have rippling effects across
the rest of the voting demographic.
The magnitude of one vote in the
grand scheme of things may not shift
a seat (if I am wrong though, I will
buy you a drink tomorrow night), but
the magnitude of one idea, one tweet
and one hashtag can change the game
entirely.
Various hashtags
including #getcameronout,
#DogsAtPollingStations, #JeSuisEd
and of course, the #milifandom have
trended sat some point or another,
and they show how the discourse
surrounding the elections has not just
evolved, but become truly impressive
and swelled in size.
And they all started with just one
post.
The ideas we’ve shared online can
influence the views of others and it is
this power social media has that can
translate into shifts of opinion, shifts
in voting and maybe even complete
shifts in parliament as a result.
Trends on twitter blend and bleeds
into the press, and this in turn leaks
into the rest of the population.
Although we may have voted in
isolation, our participation as a
young generation in this election
has been far from it. Let’s hope
that we therefore have influenced a
government that in the future will
represent us a bit better in the future,
or at the least made the rest of the
country realise we are at least a force
to be reckoned with.

Is the tweet mightier
than the vote?
