Police, camera, action!
Members of the IC Airsoft club
joined fellow airsofters in Cardiff on
the weekend of 26 and 27 November
for a totally special event: the armed
police training weekend. The session
comprised of two days of intensive
training in many aspects of combat
with special emphasis accorded to
close-quarters combat. Police offic-
ers instructed the eager trainees
in room clearing, hostage rescue,
recon, target practice, moving and
covering in disciplined formations
as well as team-building and com-
munication. The teams used Airsoft
electric air-rifles and gas-propelled
pistols, as well as flash-bang gre-
nades for the various stages of the
session.
The most difficult tasks to accom-
plishduringthesessionwere:achiev-
ing full control over our reflexes and
instinctive movements as well as
developing a method of non-verbal
communication between the mem-
bers of the squad that reached tele-
pathic levels. Truly amazingly, at the
end of the weekend we did not have
to shout commands at each other
any more as we could automati-
Imperial students train with boys in blue
cally determine when and where
we were needed, by merely assess-
ing the given situation briskly and
putting our newly gained experience
in motion. As for our reflexes, we
had a good chance to see for our-
selves that instinctive reactions are
not always the best alternative and
that a well controlled response can
deal with a challenge much better.
Moreover, we also had a good chance

to practice our snipering skills by
shooting small metal targets with
all sorts of guns and scopes, rang-
ing from the humble pistols (Glocks
etc.) and their sights, to long range
rifles (MP5, AK-47 etc.) and their
sights and laser or red-dot scopes.
It was really rewarding to see that,
with each new try, the same or bet-
ter results could be achieved with
less and less ammunitions.

Happy new year to all the loyal
readers of Felix Sport. Lots to look
forward to this term, most notably
Varsity day which provides a good
excuse for pointless abuse of med-
ics.
Just a quick comment on the above
article. Felix does not condone the
use of guns in a so-called sporting
context. Guns were not designed
to provide amusement in the same
way that golf clubs and squash rack-
ets were, they were designed to
kill. The way the pro-gun lobby are
currently hijacking our successful
Olympic bid in an attempt to over-
turn the ban on the private owner-
ship of pistols under the guise of
“concern” for Great Britain’s 2012
medal prospects in shooting events
is shameful. These sanctimonious,
self-appointed “law abiding citi-
zens” want the ban overturned so
that they can resume the practice
of their favourite past-time. They
should just accept that they’ll need
to find another hobby much in the
same way as those who were partial
to watching a spot of cock-fighting.
Their warped thinking extends to a
variety of activities that most right-
thinking people find unacceptable.
I’m sure you’re all familiar with their
standard reactionary whinge; “The
police shouldn’t be there to stop a
law-abiding person like me shoot-
ing/speeding/driving home from the
pub half-cut. They should be out
there arresting burglars/moving on
gypsies/rounding up illegal immi-
grants.” Grows tiring, doesn’t it?
As the author states, this was a
training weekend organised by the
armed police and served to illus-
trate the importance of having
well-trained officers working within
armed response and does not intend
in anyway to promote or glorify the
use of guns. With British landmarks
and citizens facing new threats in
increasingly violent animal rights
terrorists and disaffected young los-
ers, it is vital to the national interest
that we have highly trained profes-
sionals to respond to violent crimi-
nals. Events such as this serve an
excellent purpose, ensuring trans-
parency within the force itself as
well as a method of obtaining new
recruits.
Not just crazy kids with guns, but responsible trainees

Airsoft
The entire training session culmi-
nated with the final exercise where
we were expected to use our recent
training to clear a building, totally
new to us, from three police offic-
ers playing the role of ‘terrorists’
and rescue two other officers in the
roles of ‘hostages’. After less than 15
minutes, 8 rooms were cleared with-
out casualty either among hostage
squad members.
It must be said that extreme safe-
ty measures were taken. Wearing
protective masks was mandatory
throughout the entire practice ses-
sion while ear-muffs had to be worn
throughout the flash-bang grenade
tutorials. Protective gloves were
also worn as hits in the fingers cause
quite intense pain. Furthermore,
during hostage-terrorist scenarios
“we were only
allowed to fire targets
depicting armed peo-
ple aiming at us”
shooting a non-hostile target was
severely penalised as ethically
incorrect, and therefore deemed as
failure. We were only allowed to
fire targets depicting armed people
aiming at us solely and exclusively.
That applied strictly despite the fact
that the leading two members of the
squad storming a room have only
a fraction of a second to scan the
room, decide whether a target is an
immediate threat and then pull or
not pull the trigger. It is important to
know that we are not just crazy kids
with guns, but responsible trainees.
