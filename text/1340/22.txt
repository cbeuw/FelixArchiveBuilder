Teachers - Series 4 (Cert. 15)
HHHHI
H
ello. Firstly, my apolo-
gies for last weeks
bout of crude lan-
guage. Ainsley Harriot
was drafted in and
Joe’s mouth has been thoroughly
rubbed and scrubbed with Fairy
Powerspray. We promise it will not
happen again.
On Wednesday last week, the
‘grand’ finale of Lost aired on
Channel 4. The double episode was
supposed to reveal the answers to all
the secrets according to the adverts
I heard. I say ‘heard’, I didn’t watch
the adverts. Despite my best efforts
to avoid the adverts by pulling the
duvet over my eyes and covering
my ears with my hands, the spoilers
seeped through my fingers. Blimey,
I love Channel 4, but they are awful
for that!
Anyway we were expecting, rath-
er hopefully, to discover: what was
in the hatch, what was the smoke
about, what the bloody hell were the
loud growling noises in the woods,
what the heck are polar bears doing
there, what was so special about
Walt, what about Claire’s mysterious
baby and why couldn’t Charlie have
actually died when he was hung?
Ok, perhaps not the last one, but
I still ask that question whenever
the annoying pleb opens his gob.
The point is: viewers were in for an
action packed few hours in which a
tension greater than that of Hurley’s
belt would be relieved.
Unsurprisingly perhaps, we found
out almost jack shit. Even though
the actors were tormented by some
mechanical sounding ‘monster’, we
never got a view of it. The smoke
turned out to be a simple beacon,
tv
A
s a pupil, you have pre-
conceptions that teach-
ers are blank, with little
or no personality; they
don’t have lives outside
of their sorry, underpaid exist-
ence. Teachers are almost robotic
machines that operate Monday to
Friday, 8 till 6. They only know how to
shout and strike their red ball-points
in a crossing motion, or stroke in an
“F” motion if they’re the US model.
Once the end of school bell has rung
they return from bus duty, in single
file of course, to their corner of the
staff room and mark books. After
sticking down the very occasional
golden star, they walk on the left
hand side of the corridors to their
store-cupboard and power down for
the night.
Going out, smoking and drink-
ing are treats reserved for the rare
lunch down the local pub on teacher
training days. Not so for the teachers
of Summerdown Comprehensive. A
new term and a merger with anoth-
er school means the old tobacco
chimneys: fatty Lindsay, blonde sex-
pot Penny and “fucking fucker” Bob
are joined, smoking in the bogs, by
some new recruits. Ewan is like-
able, handsome and gullible; Ben
is a neurotic RE teacher but “not a
fucking Christian” and Damian is a
sarcastic loser. This bunch of booze
guzzling twenty-somethings are far
from the Demon Headmaster. They
walk through corridors swearing
like troopers, whilst in the back-
ground little Bobby, little Freddy
and tiny Timmy are all getting the
shit kicked out of them. School is lit-
erally a riot for these kids. Children
fight with medieval swords and
another set of pupils even fire off a
military mortar! However, if there
was a school award for most childish
member, the teachers would win it
every time here.
At Summerdown, the bell is cer-
tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk
but little more was known about it;
polar bears were never mentioned;
Claire’s baby was kidnapped by the
French woman and Walt was kid-
napped by a band of scruffy folk.
The episode even ended by fading
to black as Locke and Jack peered
into the hatch. All in all, even more
pieces of plot were created than
resolved! American cinema is
renowned for explaining every last
detail of a story, so leaving some-
thing for the viewer to think about
is often refreshing but Lost took the
piss. This happened throughout the
season. Whenever something was
revealed, such as the polar bears,
the following episode the island-
ers would get collective amnesia
and forget all about them! Episodes
rarely continued to the next. To end
an entire season in such a manner
gives little reward to the audience.
Lost was a chore to watch at times,
yet I must give it some credit for
making me return each week and
probably next season. Channel 4’s
apology after the final show made
me laugh and certainly summed up
the frustration neatly.
Good riddance to Jodie! The
woman who modelled her nose on
Winter Olympics ski jumps was
evicted from Celebrity Big Brother
last week. Good! Her attempts at
proving she was not a slag/bitch/
moron/cow/whinge-bag failed mis-
erably and she actually just con-
firmed the media’s portrayal. In one
discussion she said something along
the lines of “I just wanna go out and
stick my tongue down some bloke’s
throat, get wasted and have my
friends hold my hair back as I throw
up down the bog.” A classy lady
indeed. The eviction evening was
odd though. During the phone vote
advertisements, Jodie was booed
loudly, but upon eviction was greet-
ed much more kindly. Even Davina’s
interview seemed diluted; probably
to avoid her topping herself there
and then.
Anyway folks, see you next
Thursday!

G
’day again! Now which
whacker spat the
dummy over my clearly
unappreciated nappy
talk last week? I thought
brain boxes like you lot would over-
look my blue, and appreciate a bit of
slang banter from one of us common
blokes Down Under, but I’ll cop it
sweet with Ainsley’s magic hands.
You see, we all need to spread
the love, like that anonymous donor
and his 250 smackaroos. Fair suck
of the sav; his blood’s worth bot-
tling! Makes a change to all the dirty
bizzo that’s been going on around
Erinsborough.
Although there is a lot of man-to-
man love spreading goin’ on in the
‘house of trouser’. Rougher than the
wrong end of a pineapple I say! I’ve
never heard of a camp bushie, but I
can see that Toadie wearing a thong
under his suit. Plus I think he’s got a
photo of Lance ‘the horticulturist’ in
his wallet, right next to his doodles.
Lucky if that Conor has any doo-
dles with the business he’s getting
into. Italian standover men are
no wowsers. He’ll probably cark it
before Alex does.
Along with the house of ‘bend over
and take down your trousers’, and
the Timmons herd in their bus, this
area is becoming real couky. All
we need now is a rasta carrying
a boombox in the name of Radio
Raheem.
Rattle my bones all over the
stones, I’m gonna stop this yabber-
ing to ‘fight the power and increase
the peace’.

Last week’s TV DVD Review
tainly a signal for the teacher, not
the pupils; a signal for them to rush
to the bar at ‘The Orange Tree’.
Here they rip the piss out of each
other, constantly. Lindsay is “not
pregnant, just fat!”; Bob has applied
for a Thai bride on the internet;
Ben becomes obsessed with OAPs
and there’s gay awareness week
in which head teacher Claire tries
to discover “what exactly is it that
Lesbian’s do”. It’s good to see Claire
has survived from previous years.
Cod-eyed Carol’s clapping signals
Claire’s entry into the staff room:
“Shut the fuck up” she announces
to begin the new term; no changing
the ice-queen then. Carol, on the
other hand, has turned into an even
angrier, twisted version of Golum.
She grunts abuse at people, sprays
disinfectant on old people’s seats
and particularly hates lesbians.
The old cast is still excellent and
the new faces fit in pretty well too
but I couldn’t help feel that the crea-
tors were using Ewan, Damian and
Ben to replace Simon, Kurt and
Brian from earlier series. Damian
and Ben are the idiots, several cans
short of a six pack each, and Ewan is
the attractive, slightly sharper pen-
cil in the draw. This is a harder task
than getting away with insulting a
French teacher by calling her “une
salope” to her face. Still, Teachers
is still as stylishly edited and well
scripted as ever; sharp and funny.
