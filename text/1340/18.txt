Burritos, Corona and Sombreros - A recipe for hot action
Are you a native Briton?
Nope, I was born and grew up in Amsterdam,
Holland. But moved to England to study A-levels.
What would be your ideal date?
Depends on the clarity of my beer goggles! If I’m
sober I tend to be quite picky, but when I’ve had a
few in me I’m more easily satisfied.
How did you react when you found out your date
was a girlie?
It’ll be fun, I haven’t spent much time in female
company since I’ve been at Imperial. Wasn’t exactly
what I was expecting.
Disappointed then? Not at all!
How would you prefer to be woken up in the morn-
ing? A wet slap on the cheek, a mega phone in your
ear, or being sat on by a heffer?
Breakfast in bed would be fine.
What did you hope for in your stocking this Xmas?
Nothing else but you, Jack. But I must have been a
bad girl this year.
Don’t worry, there’s always next year.

Emma’sVerdict
Would you come to Equisitos again?
Definitely, the food was lovely and the
service was excellent. I’d come back for
more Thea too!
Do you have anything planned for after
the meal?
I’m going back to my halls in Evelyn
Gardens.
To do what?
Sleep, I’d imagine.
With Thea?
No, not tonight! I’ll be sleeping alone, I’m
not an easy girl, it takes more than one
date to get me between the sheets.
Is there any potential for another date?
Of course. I might even “ring” her
tomorrow.
Where would you take her for a second
date? I love the movies, so I would
probably take her to see a romantic
comedy, then back to mine for ice cream
and “coffee”.
Marks out of 10?
At least 11.
Have you enjoyed your night?
I’ve had an amazing night, I almost
chickened out at the last minute, but I’m
very glad I turned up now. It’s not every
day you get to have a free meal and meet
an awesome girl!
Thea’s Verdict
What did you think of Equisitos?
Good food, good company, good times! I
really loved the decoration as well, it’s
very authentic and traditional. If the place
wasn’t so clean I could easily have believed
I was actually in Mexico.
What did you think of Emma?
She is rather tasty, my appetite has been
satisfactorily whetted.
Just your appetite?
Yes, Jack, just my appetite.
So has she turned you gay?
She tried.
And?
“None of your business”, she tells me
smiling, as they both leave for the toilet,
giggling all the way.
Will you be seeing Emma again?
Emma: “You know you want to”.
Thea: “I do?! Of course I do, but next time
it will have to be a bit more private.”
Marks out of 10?
She’s off the scale! I’m not going to say
which way, but I’m sure that you can
guess!
What would you like to say to Felix?
Both: “Thank you Felix!”

Emma and Thea @ Equisitos
Your accent tells me your
American?
You’re a clever one, aren’t you?! I
moved here from Laguna Beach,
Florida.
What would be your ideal date?
You, Jack. You do it for me every
time.
How did you react when you found
your date was a girlie?
I live for surprises, always one to try
something new.
Are you a lesbian?
No.
That’s a shame. You must have
thought about it though?
Well I never say never.
What would be your perfect date?
Sitting on Santa’s lap in his ice
grotto, keeping each other warm.
Favourite shoe size?
As with all things, the bigger the
better.
