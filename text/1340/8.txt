Researchers reported last week
that new spacecraft observations
have cast fresh light on a process
thought to play a part in control-
ling the energy balance of stars and
galaxies.
Writing in the journal Nature, the
British, French and American team
claims that these observations pro-
vide the first strong evidence that a
process known as ‘magnetic recon-
nection’ can occur over extended
areas in space.
Magnetic reconnection is a physi-
cal process in which oppositely
directed magnetic fields are anni-
hilated and the energy stored in
them is converted to beams of ener-
getic atomic particles. This recon-
nection process is believed to drive
the dynamics of the Earth’s mag-
netosphere and is responsible for
phenomena such as solar flares and
the aurora.
Until now, a full description of
reconnection has proved elusive
because observations were only
made within the Earth’s magneto-
sphere, the band of space surround-
ing Earth that protects it from most
of the Sun’s particles. In this area

Stardust capsule returns to
Earth
A capsule containing comet
particles and interstellar dust
has landed on Earth after a
seven-year space mission. The
Stardust probe released the
capsule as it flew back to Earth
after a 4.6-billion-km (2.8-bil-
lion-mile) trip. The US-built
capsule plunged through the
atmosphere and touched down
in the Utah desert at 0312 (1012
GMT) on Tuesday. Scientists
believe the first cometary dust
samples ever returned to Earth
will shed light on the origins of
the Solar System. bbcNews
World’s biggest fish shrinking
Whale sharks spotted off the
coast of Australia are getting
smaller, researchers have said.
In a decade the average size
has shrunk from seven metres
to five metres. Whale sharks,
the world’s largest fish, are
caught for food in some east
Asian countries and Australian
researchers suspect this is
causing a decline.
The fish is listed as “vulner-
able”, and one of the authors of
the new study has described the
new finding as “a very worry-
ing sign”. The data comes from
ecotourism companies which
run expeditions to watch whale
sharks and swim with them in
Ningaloo Marine Park off the
north-west coast. bbcNews
Mutations protects from AIDS
A genetic mutation that pro-
tects people from AIDS may
make them more suscepti-
ble to the West Nile virus,
US researchers reported on
Tuesday. The study, published
in the Journal of Experimental
Medicine, underscores the the-
ory that any genetic mutation
that offers an advantage in one
area usually has some draw-
back. The mutation causes peo-
ple to have blood cells lacking a
receptor. Reuters

Take three comics, two scientists
and a group of slightly unnerved
punters reaching for their wine
glasses and you’ve got The Humour
Behind the Headlines at the Dana
Centre: a quiz-based evening look-
ing back at the science stories of
2005.
Slime mould beetles named after
important members of the Bush
administration; Snuppy the dis-
graced cloned puppy; the threat of
global warming and the fact that
poets get more sex than people of
other professions – but also have a
higher incidence of schizophrenia
– are just some of the topics dis-
cussed at tonight’s science comedy
evening at the Dana Centre.
Two teams made up of one comic
and one scientist compete to show
who knows the most about the sci-
ence headlines of 2005. Rufus Hound
competes professionally in a bat-
tle of both knowledge and wit that
closely resembles a Have I Got
News For You for science. He has a
job on his hands: chivvying rambling
Look who’s laughing now

ally laughing uproariously like an
embarrassed uncle at a family meal
trying to cover the silence. There’s
a sense of getting the fun comedy
bit over with before getting down
to the hard facts. The fact that all
the questions are answered correct-
ly does not go unnoticed. ‘What’s
George Bush been searching for
on the moon recently?’ ‘Erm, his
brain?’ ‘Weapons of mass destruc-
tion?’ ‘Cheese’ ‘Certain minerals
which could provide gases such as
hydrogen and helium to use as fuel
for astronauts?’ ‘Correct!’ It couldn’t
have been more obvious if each con-
testant had a small boy whispering
the answers into their ear.
Possibly the most disappoint-
ing aspect of the evening is the
conforming to stereotype. When
asked to talk for a minute about
her research in the ‘expert round’,
embryologist Virginia Bolton talks
for more than a minute about the
possibility of growing organs from
human stem cells as if she’s at a
conference. Rufus Hound listens,
seemingly fascinated, as she speaks
of blastomeres, inner cell masses
and totipotency as if he’s watching
someone speak a foreign language.
Paul Foot’s minute is taken up by a
charming tale of his grandmother’s
move into knitting jumpers for the
pornography industry, which while
genuinely funny (in my opinion at
least) is met with only mild chuck-
ling from the crowd. Why can’t a
scientist say something funny and a
comic something which makes a bit
more sense?
I really love the premise of the
Dana Centre. It has grabbed the
challenge of public engagement
with science and run with it, taking
in theatre, comedy and well, alcohol,
along the way. The idea of it is lovely
really – that the disillusioned mass-
es will leave Eastenders at home
and wander to South Kensington
to be informed and entertained;
like moths to the shiny light of sci-
ence-in-public. Whether it’s working
overall is hard to say, but tonight
could only be described as a damp
squib. Despite the best intentions of
integrating science and comedy, the
evening seemed only to highlight
the differences between the two.
Maybe we should leave it up to Look
Around You.
which reconnection occurs extend
over a short scale, allowing only
evidence of patchy reconnection to
be found. Scientists needed obser-
vations on a much larger scale to
prove that reconnection over dis-
tances of thousands of kilometres
can occur as predicted.
This evidence was provided in
2002, when the team discovered that
reconnection could take place in the
solar wind, a stream of particles
ejected from the atmosphere of the
Sun. Here, unlike in the magneto-
sphere, the current sheets occur
over much greater distances. This
gave researchers the opportunity to
test the theory of large-scale recon-
nection.
The first reconnection event
detected in the solar wind was expe-
rienced by three widely separated
spacecraft that found it to be at
least 2.5 million km long. In addition,
reconnection ‘exhaust’ was detected
over a period of two and a half
hours, implying that reconnection
must have been sustained over at
least that time span.
The team has since identified 27
similar events in the solar wind,
strongly suggesting that recon-
nection is large-scale and steady.
Professor Balogh of Imperial
College London, an author of the
paper, says:
“These findings really are a break-
through because magnetic recon-
nection is very difficult to observe.
Before now we have had the ‘smok-
ing gun’ of small-scale events but far
from a full picture. Now for the first
time we have proof that reconnec-
tion can and does occur on scales
that make it as important as theo-
retically predicted.”
Magnetic reconnection in solar coronal loops like these is widely
believed to play a crucial role in heating the corona.
