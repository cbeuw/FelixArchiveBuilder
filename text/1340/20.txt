I
am glad to be in a university
whose students are not politi-
cally correct. Though at times
there are some whose necks
you could wring Homer Simpson-
style for being the most deceptive
– nice to your face yet saying less
than the most complementary of
remarks behind your back, for the
most part people will be forthright
and say exactly what they think
about you, to you. I hope that this air
of frankness remains in the next two
weeks for the Islamic Awareness
Fortnight.
Of course there will be the
usual dialogue, and you may walk
past a stall in a rush with three
courseworks or so to hand in, but
if you feel like picking a (pseudo-
intellectual) fight, then I encour-
age you to do so. That’s what
the stalls and events are there
for. It is a concern that there are
still perceptions of Islam that
are common yet, from a Muslim
point of view, totally unjustified.
The underlying concept behind
all the interaction will be to try
to show the positive side of Islam
to students. An entire way of life
alien to Ancient Greek philoso-
phy, embracing an awe-inspiring
fruition or “Golden Age” when
Europe was in its Dark Ages,
and separate from the values that
ignited the Enlightenment era
in Western Europe where much
of civilisation stems from today.
There was a time in Islam when
new patterns of thought and phi-
losophy flourished, coupled with
advances in material progress and
the spread of an inter-continental
Caliphate. It is this basis of life
that governs the actions for 1.5
billion people globally – and the
number is ever growing.
I sincerely hope that the inter-
action will come to highlight the
Islamic alternative for many
issues. Islamic jurisprudence is
an immensely rich field, where
it is shown how the Qur’an and
other Islamic texts are taken
as the basis of all decisions in
Muslim life. At first glance, it
may appear counter initiative
– how can a book give solutions
to today’s problems? However a
profound empirical understanding
of the situation that is being stud-
ied, and use of a philosophy wholly
based on the Shari’ah that relies
much on analogical extension
and is the basis of judgements in
Islam. Yet the process of Ijtihad
– the study of a scholar exert-
ing his utmost effort to find the
Islamic solution on any particular

Thefts in Evelyn
Gardens
We are not a lucky demographic.
Both students and Londoners are
more likely to be victims of crime
than the population as a whole. The
sheer fluidity of life in halls means
security will never be as tight as we
would like. Students in halls need to
take a more pro-active approach to
safeguarding their home.
If someone tries to follow you
into halls, don’t let them - challenge
them. If someone rings the doorbell
and says ‘I’m here to see Dave’,
don’t just go ‘Uh, ok, then’. Even
if they get lucky and pick a weird
name, like Rupert, stick on the side
of caution.
The “famous thief” mentioned
by Adrian Medina is well known
to College security and the police.
Ceri Davies, Head of Security, told
us that he has been difficult to
apprehend as he is without a fixed
abode.
Apportioning blame in an envi-
ronment such as halls is extremely
difficult. In a situation like this, it is
often easy to blame cleaners and
security staff as they have extra
powers of access. But, to do so
without conclusive evidence is ill
advised and will cause distress to
innocent members of staff.
College have assured Felix that
any allegations against cleaning or
security staff will be dealt with “in
the same way as any crime report-
ed. All suspects will be interviewed
and the police will be informed. Any
specific allegations would be thor-

issue, gives rise to a system that
can regulate any, and in fact all,
issues that occur in society.
Take the hijaab for example.
It, like all other Shari’ah rules,
should not be viewed in isolation.
Instead hijaab is part of wider
Islamic thinking that argues
sex, sexual activity and sexual
satisfaction should not be pub-
lic. Imagine what that means.
Whenever people meet publicly
e.g. to work, trade, study, teach,
travel or politically participate in
an Islamic society they are viewed
purely for what they offer in that
particular relationship. They
are not viewed for their sexual-
ity. Gender is irrelevant. Each is
viewed simply as a human being.
Sexism disappears. No more
sex objects. No more billboards
or images of semi-clad women
required to advertise the latest
cars, music singles or Cadbury’s
Flakes. No more unrealistic
expectations of the female form to
drag down a woman’s self esteem.
Islam also recommends we all
marry early allowing us to flour-
ish within marriage so imagine
no more trying to pull someone
(or be pulled) on a Friday night.
Of course living in a sexually-
charged society brings its own
dangers. How many of us fear our
loved ones could be attacked just
because someone else is sexu-
ally agitated? Of course further
safeguards come from a Muslim’s
adherence to ultimate divine
accountability which links into
social responsibility, giving char-
ity, being a good neighbour and an
upstanding citizen.
Such issuse as these are also
parts of the Islamic way of life,
with solutions derived from rea-
soned deductions from the revela-
tion in a similar way described
above. Indeed, perhaps it is the
last that is of most concern to
non-Muslims. Is there still this
attitude that Islam is concerned
only with the spread of total Jihad
against all infidels with the sword,
indefinitely, till all is conquered or
burnt? History can be interpreted
this way, but it is also possible to
divorce the inappropriate actions
of individuals from the true
Islamic viewpoint – an encourage-
ment to respect human life that
embodies the utmost care for
both Muslims and non-Muslims as
humans. It is in this spirit of frank
debate and discussion that I’m
sure we all hope the interaction of
all peoples with far ranging views
on life’s matters will occur.

evidence of a crime being commit-

What’s troubling us at Felix
most is how anyone could be stu-
pid enough to have thousands of
pounds lying around their room.
That sort of money is just a tempta-
tion too strong to ignore.
Library: 24/7
& redevelopment
Last year, the library was one of the
most contentious issues covered
by Felix. The conditions, frankly,
were disgusting and definitely not
conducive to effective study. If 24/7
is to work successfully this year,
students must respect the facility
and each other. If you see anyone
brushing their teeth or washing
cabbage in the toilet take a picture
and we will name and shame them
in Felix.
Some students have been sent
emails by their senior tutors tell-
ing them to “get a good nights rest
before exams”. Doesn’t having the
library open 24/7 contradict this
good advice?
Hopefully, once the redevelop-
ment has been completed, the
library will be a more pleasant
place to study and we will finally be
assured of finding a spare place to
study.
We want to hear your views
on these issues, please email
