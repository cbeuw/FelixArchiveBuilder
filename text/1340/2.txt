The National Union of Students
(NUS) has launched a campaign
this week to try and resist the loom-
ing introduction of top-up fees by the
government. Under current plans,
students across the country will face
a £2,000 hike in their annual fees
unless MPs are persuaded to take
the issue to the Commons later this
year. A coalition of unions, including
teaching unions from the university,
college and school sectors, intend to
join the NUS in lobbying MPs to help
oppose the government initiative.
The impact of the impending fees
has had a marked influence on the
number of university applications
for the next academic year. UCAS
figures due to be released at the end
of the month are expected to show
a significant decline in university
applications despite the government
target to get 50% of 18-30 year olds in
Higher Education by 2010. “The evi-
dence is already mounting up that
tuition fees will not open up access
to Higher Education, particularly
for students from less traditional
backgrounds. This is in clear con-
tradiction to the government’s aim
to get record numbers of students
into universities over the next few
years,” said Kat Fletcher, President
of the NUS.
Imperial College, which hasn’t
been a member of the NUS for over
20 years, had previously attracted
widespread media attention over
top-up fees due to the Rector’s well
publicised support. He believes that
charging the full economic costs for
going to university will allow more
money to be diverted to those who
can’t afford it.
Sir Richard told Felix, “We know it
costs a minimum of £12,000 per year
to educate our lab-based students,
with Medicine being around £25,000.
We can’t stop teaching Chemistry,
even though we’re losing about
£8,000 per student, because it’s an
integral part of Imperial College.
The government has to recognise
that.”
The revised fees, which will mean
students repay the tuition costs of
their education after starting work,
have been hailed as a realistic alter-
native which aims to ease the prob-
lem of university under-funding.
Ministers have repeatedly argued
that the £3,000 fee would not act
as a deterrent to students, “I most
certainly do not believe that we are
going to see a major downturn in
applications. Many students would
be better off under the new system,
with more generous grants and bur-
saries,” said Bill Rammell, Minister
for Higher Education.
The NUS President wasn’t con-
vinced, “If MPs really believe edu-
cation is the key to social mobility,
they need to act now to stop univer-
sity education becoming a privilege
reserved for those who can afford it.
We are calling on them to support
the coalition in fighting against any
removal of the cap which could see
universities charging five figure fees
for an education.”
The coalition group came togeth-
er at the House of Commons on
Tuesday, 17 January, for the NUS’
Annual Reception. The event
was hosted by Ian Gibson, MP
, an
ardent campaigner against top-
up fees, alongside representatives
from across the education sector.
Commenting on the potential for
success amongst the coalition,
Gibson said, “The coalition lays the
foundations for real long-term inter-
action between those who represent
students and those who represent
teachers, lecturers and staff work-
ing in our schools, colleges and uni-
versities, which is very exciting. I
pledge my full support to the coali-
tion and I look forward to working
with them in achieving their aims.”

Your Imperial policy?
Gordon Brown called for a ‘British
Day’ to celebrate British achieve-
ments, history and culture when
speaking at a left-of-centre Fabian
Society conference in Imperial
College last Saturday. He set out his
belief that we should build a “strong,
modern sense of patriotism” and
reclaim the Union flag from the far
right.
In his speech, the Chancellor ques-
tioned the lack of a declaration of
our national objectives and the need
for a British version of the Fourth
of July, America’s Independence
Day. He remarked that perhaps
Armistice Day is the closest equiv-
alent we have to commemorate
“standing firm for the world in the
name of liberty.”
The idea of a day to celebrate
Britishness was widely supported,
though reservations were made
about combining it with Armistice
Day or Remembrance Sunday.
Another suggested date was 1 May,
the day the Act of Union came into
effect in 1707, uniting England and
Wales with Scotland to form Britain.
The Scottish Nationalist Party was
quicktorefutetheideaofBritishness
as well as attacking Brown, suggest-
ing this is mere positioning in his
aspiration to be Prime Minister.
Mr. Brown emphasised the impor-
tance of being clearer about what
it means to be British, suggesting
that if we were more confident of
our British identity, we could have
acted decades earlier in supporting
African countries and not cowered
in the shadow of our past role as an
imperial power. He also attributed
it to the slow speed of reform, cit-
ing the “fear of losing our British
identity” as key to our avoidance
of addressing constitutional issues
such as reform of the House of
Lords.
Whilst welcoming this, the Tories
cautioned Brown not to attempt to
answer the question of Britishness
without building a consensus.
Oliver Heald, Conservative Shadow
Secretary of State for constitutional
affairs, said, “building Britishness
should reflect the interests not of
one party, but of the whole country.”

This Week
As engineers and scientists, we have
an immediate and significant impact
on society, for better and for worse.
Fortunately, it is up to all of us
to define what Imperial’s contribu-
tion to society ought to be, and how
our policy should reflect other ethi-
cal issues such as equality, diver-
sity and fairness in student recruit-
ment. Imperial College is drafting
a new Ethical Policy Framework to
address these questions, and wants
students’ feedback to ensure that a
constructive – and representative
– policy is arrived at.
Take this opportunity to voice your
Alon Or-bach
opinion to the framework’s coordi-
nator, Pro Rector (Research) Prof.
Chris Hankin. You will find a copy
of the draft document on the ICU
Pugwash website, where you can
submit feedback through a simple
survey. The survey results will be
presented directly to Prof. Hankin
at the end of this month, along with
the conclusions from a debate which
ICU Pugwash will host on 24 January
to discuss how the proposed policy
could be implemented. We hope to
see you there - see our website for
details! ICU Pugwash: www.union.

Brown wants us to have a British
version of 4th of July
Bank oﬀers £3,000 bursary
In an attempt to lure graduates
into the financial services sector,
Deutsche Bank have announced
that they will offer an annual bursa-
ry of £3,000 to students at five of the
country’s top universities, including
Imperial.
The bank, which is targeting stu-
dents from all backgrounds, will
be offering the bursary to one stu-
dent at each of Imperial, Oxford,
Cambridge, Warwick and the
London School of Economics. The
offer is “open to all” applicants, who
simply have to show a “demonstra-
ble interest in the financial services
industry”.
Deutsche ensured that the £3,000
they will be providing matches the
amount universities will be able to
charge in tuition due to top-up fees,
starting this year. They hope that
the bursaries will help them stand
out more to students as a future
employer. However, the winners of
the bursaries won’t be under any
obligation to join the bank after
graduation. So if you were looking
for more beer money, then look no
further.
