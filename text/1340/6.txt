I
do have a wee confession to
make here, but despite the
Scottish patois it’s not as
striking as that of a certain
ex-Liberal Democrat leader.
My confession is that in this column
I would take a sideways look at the
many and varied events that would
take place every week in the name
of college politics. Unfortunately due
to the recent Christmas holiday, eve-
ryone had the sheer gall to take the
last three weeks off, leaving me with
no material to play with. (Except
maybe for the SWSS hijack/”Singing
in the rain” audition which was the
dress code protest which occured
last term, but that’s so old. Get with
the times Grandad!). Well I could
try; lets see…delayed sports centre;
dontcha just hate it? See, it wdoesn’t
work.
So I have to look further around
for my weekly source of entertain-
ment, and put my toe into the murky
pond of national politics. No don’t
run, it’ll be as good, I promise!
What can I write about? Well I
was going to have a light-hearted
look at the recent sex-offenders in
schools scandal, until I realised that
if I were to do so I’d almost certainly
go to hell. I don’t know about you,
but personally I wouldn’t like to end
up being prodded from behind with
a red-hot poker for all eternity. Oh
wait…bugger it.
In lieu of this, let me tell you about
a man who’s in the spotlight at the
moment. This was a man who was
elected in the last general election,
promising to protect his constitu-
ents in a very ethnic area of London.
Since his election, he’s rarely been
in the Commons, speaking in only
four debates, and missing out on
important speeches that affects the
people he represents, including not
turning up to vote on anti-terror
laws, shunning them for publicity-
seeking events, including one at our
very own university.
This sensational ego-stroking
has come to a head when this man
accepted 60 grand to appear on a
reality TV show, spending the week
trying to make conversation with
Michael Barrymore (in return, he
gives him dirty scowls – another
diplomatic victory there). Well, you
might say it’s as if he hasn’t more
important things to do, such as, tak-
ing a purely random example. take
part in the Crossrail debate in the
Commons this week; a rail project
which will have massive implica-
tions on his Bethnal Green and Bow
constituents if it went ahead.
In the immortal words of Rolf
Harris…can you guess who it is
yet?
“The future of Charing
Cross is still uncertain”

Felix catches up with Greg Hands, Conservative MP for Hammersmith
and Fulham, whose constituency represents many Imperial students
“Charing Cross
Hospital has the
second largest deficit
in the UK, which
currently lies at
around £37 million”
that the time saving through the
extension zone would only be half a
minute. As a regular bus user I feel
that to be a too much of a sacrifice”
There was also the problem of the
impact on local businesses – one
of the main arguments against the
congestion charge, and one that
Greg Hands strongly believes in,
speaking of how small businesses
lose out from passing trade, and how
it encourages the use of out-of-town
shopping centres instead, saying
how “Places like Bluewater prob-
ably love the Congestion Charge”.
The comparison he made next
though was astonishing, citing how
John Lewis in Oxford Street (hardly
a small, local business) lost sales
from the Congestion Charge, whilst
a comparable shop, Peter Jones in
Sloane Square, had no effect. I say
it’s astonishing, as a quick Google
search shows that the John Lewis
figures came from a report (which it
commissioned itself) which showed
an apparent 5.52% drop in sales over
the period; but in comparison over
the first half of 2005 it showed a 6%
rise in sales, and managed to buck

Politics Editor
G
reg Hands, for those
not politically inclined,
is the newley elected
member of parliament
for Hammersmith and
Fulham. Taking the seat in the 2005
general election, winning with a
swing of just under 6%, he was one
of the success stories of the last
election, seen as a prime example
of how the Labour government has
lost its grip over the last eight years.
Just before Christmas, he was
the guest speaker at the Chelsea
Conservative club, and Felix decid-
ed to give him a visit.
I started off the interview by ask-
ing Greg how he felt to be elected
as an MP
, after serving on the local
council. He told us that it was an
exciting time to be in politics at the
moment, citing some of the extraor-
dinary events of the past twelve
months, including Blair’s first defeat
in the Commons, Britain’s presi-
dency of the EU, and more shocking
events, such as the London bomb-
ings. “It’s been a very exciting time
to be at the centre of politics” is how
Greg summed it up “I’m pleased
to be the first Conservative MP for
Hammersmith and Fulham”, not-
ing that due to boundary changes
he is the first Conservative MP for
Hammersmith since the 60’s.
As the MP for the London bor-
ough of Hammersmith and Fulham,
Greg Hands presides over an area
of London, which is the home for
many Imperial students who live
in Fulham, Putney and Shepherds
Bush. I asked Greg if he has any poli-
cies planned them? “One of our aims,
which is very relevant to Imperial
in particular, is to save Charing
Cross Hospital”, the main school for
medic students, and for which Greg
has met with the medic’s students
union to help resolve the dispute.
“We are also aiming, in a general
way, to improve public transport in
West London, and to reduce crime”,
including trying to get the Piccadilly
line to stop at Ravenscourt Park and
Stamford Brook. On Charing Cross,
I asked how certain its future was,
to be confronted by depressing news
on how the Hammersmith hospital’s
trust has the second largest deficit
in the UK, currently being around
£37 million in debt, which might
require services being cut and also
being moved to Hammersmith hos-
pital in a bid to save money.
Greg Hands has also been actively
campaigning for other issues around
the area, including an appearance at
a demonstration against the con-
gestion charge extension last year.
“I’m fanatically opposed to the
Congestion Charge extension, and
I say that as somebody who doesn’t
have a car” he told Felix. “I’m wor-
ried for my constituents, who will
suffer from the diverted traffic”,
claiming that transport that’ll go
through London will naturally divert
through Hammersmith and Fulham
to avoid the extended zone. What
about the effect on public transport,
I asked? Surely the extension will
be a good effect for the many people
who’d commute into the capital?
Greg wasn’t supportive of this argu-
ment. “All the studies have shown
the trend of falling Christmas sales
of 2005, with an increase of 12% from
last year.
On a lighter note, Greg Hands was
sad to see the recent decommision-
ing of the Routemaster buses, calling
them “A great icon for London...It’s a
great shame to see it go”. He wasn’t
too impressed with the reasons for
its departure: “The main arguement
is wheelchair accessability, which is
fair enough...but how many wheel-
chairs do you see on those buses?” I
did mention, however, that although
this may be true, there was the fact
that there are a lot of pushchairs
on the the bus these days, which
the old Routemasters can’t cater
for.. Acknowledging this, he asked
for a system where Routemasters
are running alongside newer buses,
such as the 14 and 414 in Fulham.
After the interview, Greg Hands
gave a speech to the assembled,
but what was interesting was his
views on the current state of British
politics. Despite supporting Liam
Fox in the recent party leader-
ship race, he gave great praise to
David Cameron, describing how
“He has performed increadibly well,
at Prime Minister’s question time,
and in various speeches” Pre-deter-
mining the resignation of Charles
Kennedy (this was in December,
remember), he also pointed out that
with Blair stepping down at the end
of his term, the next general elec-
tion will be the first one since 1979
where there will be three fresh lead-
ers competing for votes - a unique
moment, and one that should create
a lot of fertile debate over the next
few years.
