On 1 February, Imperial College London will host its first Ethical Careers
Exhibition. Imperial has an excellent reputation for equipping students for top
careers in science, engineering and business, and alumni go on to work for
some of the world’s biggest companies. But the range of career paths available
that combine challenging work and a competitive salary with making a positive
difference to the world has never been greater, and more graduates than ever are
looking to find ethical work.
At the Exhibition, we’ll be showcasing some of the ways to find a career that
protects or promotes peace, social justice or environmental sustainability. It won’t
be like other careers fairs – our exhibitors come from a huge range of sectors
and backgrounds, and are looking for graduates with all levels of experience. The
event is open to anyone, so whether you’re wondering what to do after graduation,
already in the world of work and looking for a change, or just want to support
the idea of ethical business, come along and explore what’s on offer. We have
exhibitors from the public, private, and academic sectors, and a packed seminar
programme covering everything from sustainable engineering to charity work,
careers in the civil service to tackling climate change. Be inspired – perhaps over a
cup of tea from our free FairTrade Cafe – by browsing the poster display, featuring
stories of graduates whose careers have taken an ethical direction.
Next week’s Felix will contain a full guide on how to get the most from the
Exhibition – your first step towards a rewarding career with an ethical dimension.
Hope to see you there.
