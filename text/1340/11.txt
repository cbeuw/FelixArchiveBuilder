Munich, Sept 1972: Free tickets!
If you think Eric Bana is the man, you wouldn’t want to miss this one
I
n September 1972, a group of
Palestinian extremists invad-
ed the Olympic Village in
Munich, West Germany. With
the intention of highlighting
the Palestinian plight to the world,
they killed and captured the rest of
the Israeli Olympic team. Despite
Germany’s efforts to recapture the
hostages, all of the Israelis were
killed 21 hours later.
Munich isn’t a story about how
the family members of the Israeli
Olympic team handled the tragedy.
This is a story about how the Israeli
government decided to stop the kill-
ing of Israelis by taking an eye for
an eye. They call it the “Operation
Wrath of God”.
The operation is led by the young
and inexperienced intelligence
officer, Avner (Eric Bana). The
rest of the assassination team con-
sists of the getaway driver, Steve
(Daniel Craig), the document-forger
Hans (Hanns Zischler), the Belgian
toy-turned bomb-maker, Robert
(Mathieu Kassovitz) and the clean-
up man, Carl (Ciaran Hinds).
Thanks to Dreamworks Ltd. And
Sublime movies, Felix has 5 pairs
of tickets to give away to our loyal
readers. And these tickets are for
a special preview screening just for
students on the 23rd of January.
Now, the question remains. How
do you get your hands on those
tickets? It’s time for a little history
quiz.
1. What is the name of the Palestinian
extremist group that invaded the
Olympic Village in Munich?
2. Who was the head of the Israeli
government who staunchly refused
to negotiate with the terrorists?
3. What event led the German gov-
ernment to free the three surviving
members of the Palestinian extrem-
ists involved in the Munich mas-
sacre?
4. Which PLO bases did the Israel
Air Force bomb as a response to the
terrorist act on September 9th?
The five people who get the highest
number of correct answers and send
in their replies by 20 January will be
the lucky five to watch Munich for
free. (And a mate too!) What are
you waiting for? Google the answers
and hurry!

Your mission: To kill and not get killed in the processs.
iCU cinema:
money is scant after all the New
Year celebrations.)
Next week, they are showing
Keeping Mum and Mrs. Henderson
Presents. Are you asking me what?
(Seriously, don’t you even keep up
with the times? I mean, pass the
general news over and at least
scan the upcoming movies section.
*Kidding.)
Keeping Mum features Mr. Bean
or Rowan Atkinson in a serious role.
The gist is that he plays a pastor and
his family is falling apart from his
biblical obsession. If you are a fan of
the man himself, you wouldn’t want
to miss this.
The next one is Mrs. Henderson
Presents. Maybe most of you didn’t
hear about it, but it’s a British film.
Maybethat’sanotherreasontowatch
it? ( Perhaps it’s the odd streak of
patriotism.) To sum it up, it’s a show
about a widow who decides to start
a theatre with nude-acts. Sounds
interesting? (Perverts.) You should
check it out. After all, it got a 7/10
on imdb. And imdb is rarely wrong
(except in the case of A lot like love.
They seriously hate Ashton Kutcher.
It’s prejudiced!)
Okay, now, why am I telling you
all this? Because iCU cinema is
giving out free tickets. On Tuesday,
be the first four people with this
Felix article to get to iCU cinema
and get a free ticket each to watch
either Mrs. Henderson Presents or
Keeping Mum. (Your choice!)
Remember the times: 6 and 8pm
on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Check
out their listings on the iCU cinema
at www.union.ic.ac.uk/arts/cinema.
Get your sneakers ready and good
luck!
Free tickets! Pay attention now
These beauties are ready to take centre stage, without any clothes on!
Now, I’ve been to tons of cinemas.
(Unfortunately, yes.) And as a result,
I should expect myself difficult to
impress. (insert hilarious laughter)
Hence, why do I think you should
visit iCU cinema?
Firstly, you’ll be surprised but
the sound quality of their ‘cinema’
is actually very good. It definitely
beats downloading the movie off
the Internet, watching it on laptop
speakers (the horror!) and it’s defi-
nitely legitimate. (Hence, you don’t
have to worry about being tracked
and later trialed in court by some
ominous movie company.)
Secondly, the movies are fairly
recent. The people at iCU cinema
pay good money to ensure that
you get to see the best movies in
the comfort of your own campus.
Considering it receives Union sup-
port, not going to the iCU cinema
will be tantamount to paying the
union and not using the amenities
provided. (In English, that would
mean, it’s utterly stupid to not go to
the iCU cinema.)
Thirdly, it’s in campus. Need I say
more? Especially first-years who
stay in Beit Quadrangle, you don’t
even need to don the heavy winter
coat to watch a movie. You don’t
have to take a bus or a tube ride to
get there. (This means, that you do
not have to suffer being harassed by
strange people who decide to go on
tracks and hence cause a huge delay
on the tube line.)
Lastly, it makes perfect economic
sense to visit iCU cinema. It’s only
3 pounds and since you don’t have
to take a bus or a tube, visiting
the iCU cinema is just perfect for
the skimpy student budgets. (Yes,
