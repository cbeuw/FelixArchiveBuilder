Security has been tightened at
Evelyn Gardens’ halls following a
spate of recent burglaries. Concerns
raised by the Union Accommodation
Committee were brought to the
Rector’s attention by Sameena
Misbahuddin, the Union President,
after student representatives voiced
their criticism of current practices.
The Rector responded by appoint-
ing a permanent officer stationed
outside Evelyn Gardens with
access to the area’s live CCTV foot-
age. Additionally, safes have been
installed in each of the rooms of
Bernard Sunley Hall for a trial peri-
od.
Miss Misbahuddin is very pleased
with the College’s reaction, “The
response has been really good… the
safes have always been an idea and
until we trial them we’ll never know
what the effect will be. It should pro-
vide much better security for stu-
dents’ possessions. The area hasn’t
had much security presence in the
recent past, especially when you
consider that they have five halls
down there, so having the secu-
rity guards should be a big help to
improving the situation.”
The move comes in response to
the rising incidence of theft from
halls within Evelyn Gardens. At the
Committee Meeting last November,
representatives stated that an
increasing number of valuable items
had been reported stolen from stu-
dent’s rooms. The incidents, which
took place in the first week of the
autumn term, included the theft of

an alleged £10,000 from one stu-
dent’s locked drawer and £2,000
from another. Laptops and other
valuables were also reported miss-
ing.
Existing security measures in
the Gardens were further criticised
after a suspicious man was seen
exiting Bernard Sunley Hall carry-
ing stolen goods. Adrian Medina,
who is on the Accommodation
Committee, told Felix, “I saw the
famous thief which haunts us every
year leave Southwell Hall carrying
a black laptop bag. He is a big guy
so I didn’t really want to challenge
him, instead I followed him whilst
a friend of mine called security but
they weren’t answering.
“Coincidentally, I saw the police
on the street and pointed the thief
out but they didn’t manage to catch
him. He had gotten into halls by
tail-gating, as shown on the CCTV. It
was the first day of the year and the
freshers didn’t know each other well
so nobody in halls realised that he
wasn’t a student. He got into a room
on the second floor which had been
left open and stole a laptop, mobile
phone and other items.” Although
the incident was reported to the
4444 Sherfield Security emergency
extension, the response was too
slow and no immediate action was
taken, leaving many students feel-
ing increasingly vulnerable.
Ally Crowther, a resident at
Bernard Sunley, told Felix, “At the
time of the thefts last term, it was
rather nerve-wracking and it defi-
nitely seemed like Evelyn Gardens

Murder in Beit Quad Library to
go 24/7
again
Saba Shafi
From the beginning of the Easter
holidays and throughout the sum-
mer term, the Central Library will
once again be operating twenty-four
hours a day, seven days a week. The
extended opening has been given
the go-ahead despite many com-
plaints in previous years from both
staff and students regarding the
“appauling conditions”.
Students complained of “a lack of
ventilation and a persistent smell”,
due to the large number of stu-
dents cramped into study spaces.
Some also felt that there was a lack
of refreshments. Many students
resorted to bringing in hot takea-
way food as there was nowhere to
buy and eat food on campus. Staff
objected to students’ flagrant lack
of respect for the rules. Last year,
Felix revealed that some students
had ‘moved into’ the library, bring-
ing sleeping bags and brushing their
teeth in the toilets.
One student described the library
as “a total mess, with tea bags and
leftovers everywhere”. Security
guards were required to patrol the
library to ensure that the rules were
abided to. Several students were
even referred to their college tutors
after disputing the results with the
security officers.
In spite of all these problems and
the fact that some students told
Felix that “there is no need for it to
be open all night”, the library will
again be open 24/7 from the start
of the Easter holidays. In contrast,
Clare Jenkins, Director of Libraries,
told us that approximately two hun-
dred students were still studying
until 2am every night during the
exam period. She stated that the
usage had been “higher and bet-
