Every now and then we are remind-
ed of the greatness of Sport, of the
way it creates and moulds char-
acter and of the way it can bring
a collection of individuals together
and create something spectacular.
Everyone present at Berrylands
Sports Ground last Wednesday saw
a true example of this. Coming into
this match with their sights firmly
fixed on promotion as well as the
top position in their BUSA league,
the IC 2nds knew a difficult match
awaited them, due to the reverse
fixture having been a tense encoun-
ter that had resulted in a narrow 2-1
victory.
LSE settled first, however, and
began to start passing the ball
around, exerting some pressure on
the IC defence. They won several
corners and a cross from one of
these was (allegedly) handled in the
penalty area by IC’s centre-back,
Sami, resulting in a penalty that
was duly converted. The first goal
really took the wind out of IC’s sails
and the home team began passing
the ball about with ease as Imperial
struggled to gain control of the ball
for any significant length of time.
Following an IC attack, with most
of the team out of position, a long
ball down the right wing gave LSE’s
striker a run at goal, with Sami
in close attention. As the attacker
shot from inside the box the ball
deflected off Sami’s leg, over the
unfortunate James Haugh and into
the goal.
LSE really began to dominate
at this point, (Masters would have
been proud) punishing (steady
Masters) Imperial’s midfield’s ina-
bility to string passes together, by
spreading the ball to their wingers
and playing direct football. When
Richie P attempted a risky square
ball in midfield it was intercept-
ed and the winger ran halfway up
the pitch unchallenged and slotted
the ball into the bottom corner. IC
were looking dead and buried at
this point, lacking any imagination
going forwards and appearing shaky
at the back. They were lucky not to
concede another as a header was
cleared off the line by Leon just
before half-time.
At 3-0 down at half-time it would
have been easy to simply give up,
but the true character of the side
emerged as the 2nd half began. In
crisis situations like this teams rely
not only on grit and determination
but also individual brilliance and
this was provided, not for the final
time in the match, by MOM Chris
Parrott, Directly from kick-off Chris
ran past two LSE players before
hitting an awesome left-footed drive
from twenty five yards directly into
the bottom corner. This display of
footballing genius stunned the home
side and gave the IC team the belief
that they could take something
from the match. They began play-
ing excellent football, running for
each other and working as a unit to
close down their opponents as soon
as the ball was lost. Every player in
the team raised their game and the
match had performed an about-turn.
Chris Parrot was causing havoc for
the LSE side every time he touched
the ball and he was being well sup-
ported by the Gas Man.
IC were rewarded for all their pres-
sure when after around 60 minutes,
Pricey clipped a lovely ball over the
top for Parrott, who squared the ball
for AK who hit a cracking shot off
the post from the edge of the area.
AK made some changes at this
point, swapping Leon for a waxwork
figure of CP
, as LSE were now terri-
fied of going anywhere near him (or
was it his twin brother Graeme?)
and Gas Man for Robert Pires,
who’d been kept on the bench as a
secret weapon. They both immedi-
ately looked effective, with Graeme
Parrott almost setting up his broth-
er with a lovely cross from the right
wing, forcing a great save of the
goalkeeper from close range. The
pressure continued to mount, the
fruit of which came to bear after IC
won a corner on their right wing.
Pricey whipped in a corner to
the edge of the penalty area where
Richie P leapt above the defence to
score a bullet header which hit the
crossbar and went in. Or rather he
scrambled it in from one yard using
his hip, although the LSE contin-
gent felt rather strongly that the ball
had not crossed the line. Bearing
in mind the fact that it hadn’t, it’s
easy to sympathise with the players
who were cautioned in the rush to
implore the referee to reconsider
his decision.
No matter, IC scented blood and
with twenty minutes to go they set
about the deflated home team like
a pack of hounds and were caus-
ing problems all over the field. CP
slipped Pires through but he was
unable to beat the keeper. By now
the LSE team were hanging on, hop-
ing to salvage something from the
game and were sitting back inviting
pressure on themselves.
GP won a free kick on the right
wing and it was whipped in by
Pricey, onto the head of Milad who
saw his header hit the bar and fall to
the head of Pires who, with the goal
gaping and the ‘keeper nowhere,
unselfishly decided to head the ball
back off the crossbar and give GP
the goal instead.
He obliged and the IC team found
themselves ahead for the first time.
Rather than sit on the lead they con-
tinued to press forward and create
chances, with Pricey being unlucky
to head over the bar in the closing
seconds.
The final whistle sparked scenes
of jubilation and allowed the 2nds to
bask in the knowledge that they had
pulled of one of the most memorable
results in history. They had shown
heart and courage in the face of
adversity and may that be a lesson
to all sports teams. Never give up
chasing down seemingly lost caus-
es, never stop applying yourselves
even when the easy option would be
to lie down and accept defeat.
