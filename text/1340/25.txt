Sagittarius (Nov 22nd – Dec 21st)
You tend to put up
an emotional bar-
rier which prevents
others from getting to
know you, as the week
progresses you will
feel more at ease as you let your
emotions show.
Capricorn (Dec 22nd – Jan 19th)
Current lesions in
your karmic fabric
suggest an infiltration
of dimorpic differenc-
es. Aim to settle this
by doing away with
your fear of confrontation.
Aquarius (Jan 20th – Feb 18th)
This week you will
truly find your winter
wonderland. It’s time
to search for a special
wardrobe, and I don’t
just mean clothes.
Pisces (Feb 19th – Mar 20th)
The new year is feel-
ing dark and dismal
and so are you. You
feel that the stars are
not shining on you, in
fact these days they
don’t seem to shine at all. Trust
instead in the benevolence of the
moon.
Aries (Mar 21st – Apr 20th)
Your confidence and
self esteem are grow-
ing.... Go on show off a
bit. By the end of the
week you’ll be danc-
ing away to PCD and
turning a few heads... ‘Won’t Cha?!’
Taurus (Apr 21st - May 21st)
With Mars receding
from the sun your
moods have become
slightly black of late,
even thought you
portray a sham face.
Compensate by focus-
ing on your neighbour.
Gemini (May 22nd - Jun 21st)
Your extroverted
nature begins to wain
and you may find
yourself questioning
self motivation. Just
ride out this bumpy
week and soon the path will be
smooth and ice. Just wait and see.
Cancer (Jun 22nd – Jul 22nd)
Your normally unas-
suming placid nature
may soon backfire.
Others are getting
tired of your noncom-
mittal attitude. You
cake have you cake and eat it too...
make up your mind.
Leo (Jul 23rd – Aug 22nd)
Now the second moon
of Jupiter have moved
into your alignment it
is time to make a start
on the endless pile of
tasks that have been
put aside for that elusive rainy day
Virgo (Aug 23rd – Sep 22nd)
Someone from your
past resurfaces, much
to your surprise and
shows you that there
is more to life than the
boring routine you’ve
adapted of late. Be open-minded.
Libra (Sep 23rd – Oct 22nd)
Having reached a
plateau in your social
affairs the movement
of Venus suggests
that curtailing your
busy lifestyle would
allow you to visualize the pathway
to your inner most desires.
Scorpio (Oct 23rd - Nov 21st)
Your susceptibility
to the opposite sex is
brought into ques-
tion as we get closer
to the sun. You must
become focused and
realise you must protect your heart
even if you must still wear it on your
sleeve.
It’s raining it’s pouring......
Dear Miss C,
I have found recently that I am
totally incapable of using an
umbrella correctly, especially in
crowds. I mean whenever I go out, I
seem either to soak the people who
are standing around me, or I get
my own eyes poked out. Is there a
proper way to use an umbrella?
Soaked and poked
Dear Soaked and poked,
Hmmmm interesting, etiquette to
using an umbrella. Well there are
some rules that if you follow should
help you out. Firstly, when walking
with a group of people during
some monsoon like rain if you have
a gigantic umbrella (which are
just extremely inconvenient and
greedy when it comes to pavement
space, don’t get one!!) It should
go on the top of all the umbrellas,
if you have a baby one don’t have
illusions off grandeur, stay on the
bottom where you belong. Secondly
the best place to be is always the
bottom centre; otherwise you just
get run off from other umbrellas
spoiling your hair and outfit. As to
the getting poked, well that mainly
happens to me when I let someone
taller than me hold the umbrella,
and somehow it always ends up in
my eyes, so moral of that story, hold
your own umbrella, always pack a
spare one for those people who are
forgetful and puppy dog eye you for
your precious umbrella space or
threaten them with a painful death
should they poke your eye out.
Other handy hints, beware when
opening umbrella for smacking
someone in the face, also call me
superstitious but don’t open an
umbrella indoors, you’re just asking
for bad luck. If all of this has you
totally confused then just wear a
raincoat and if all else fails, just
refuse to leave the house on rainy
days, which in England is most of
the year so be prepared to become
a hermit!
All by myself.....
Dear Miss C,
My boyfriend has just broken up
with me, he says he thinks its over
but when I asked him if we’d ever
get back together again, he said he
wasn’t sure. I call him all the time
because I still really want to speak
to him and I just can’t bear the
thought of him with someone else. I
don’t think I can live without him,
how do I win him back?
Crying In Chelsea,
Dear Crying in Chelsea,
Oh dear! You want my honest
advice? Let it go and please for all
our sakes, chill with the dramatics.
He’s broken up with you for a
reason, and as hard as it is to break
up with partners, you’re really not
making this any easier on yourself.
It’s as though your tormenting
yourself on purpose, which is just
stupid. You guys have broken up for
a reason, and if you will ever have a
chance to get back together all the
reasons it didn’t work out in the first
place have to be solved. For that
you both need time apart to think
about whether it will ever really
work again, but acting like a stalker
and haunting his every movement
is not going to aid your case. If
you blatently came out and asked
him if you will ever back together
again only heartless bastards, who
unfortunately do exist, would ever
say no. In his credit he seems to be
dealing with your hysterics pretty
well, but that won’t last long. If you
value his friendship and honestly
don’t want to lose him, then I’d say
step back, give the guy his space.
If you need a pick me up, shopping
spree and a wild girls night out
seems to be the medication you
need.
And then there were none.....
Dear Miss C,
I am currently a first year in halls,
and been having an ok-ish time.
However last week I feel asleep
downstairs in the common room
and when I woke up I discovered
I had no eyebrows. What do you
suggest I do?
Feeling mutilated
Dear Feeling mutilated,
Well as sympathetic as I am for
your cause, I can’t say you didn’t
seem to have it coming. Falling
asleep in the common room during
first year? You might as well be
wearing a big flashing red sign
saying play a prank on me!! As
to what to do with the missing
eyebrows, well there is always the
wear a beanie hat until they grow
back, its still winter so you could
get away with that. Secondly you
could resort to eyebrow pencil. If
you can’t bring yourself to walk
in to boots to buy one, I’d suggest
borrowing form a female friend’s
make-up bag, and then try and draw
them back in. A hint from one girl
to an eyebrow-less boy, sweep the
pencil in one smooth stroke, but you
don’t want thin eyebrows so make
them a little bit fuller! Remember
less is more. You never know you
mighty turn out to have a knack
and be complemented for your
skills with make-up. Thirdly and
probably most effectively, just play
it off as a joke!! People will probably
respect you for being able to take a
joke. But if all else fails, remember
revenge is sweet, and a dish best
served cold.
Dear Miss Conﬁdentiality...
Hey guys! Just a quick b-day
