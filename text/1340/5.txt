significant boost. China continued
to suck-in raw materials, and sup-

copper, aluminium and zinc to multi-
year highs.
In the equity markets 2005 was
the third consecutive year of dou-
ble-digit global growth, with shares
globally growing 10.1 per cent in
dollar terms. In the US the S&P
500 index rose barely 5 per cent, as
high interest rates hit US corporate
profits. Europe-wide shares were
up 22.5 per cent on the year, while in
London the FTSE 100 was up 16 per
cent. The two star performers were

of shares was up 40 per cent, and
Russia, where shares rose 80 per
cent.Despite the strength of global

of record prices of oil and other com-
modities, the strong dollar, and pos-
sibly, the year that growth began to
recover in Europe and Japan.
The strength of the US dollar

At the start of the year, the con-
sensus was that the dollar’s value
would continue to fall relative to
other currencies, weighed down by
the US trade and budget deficits,
and a possible collapse in the US
housing market bubble. Warren
Buffet, the legendary investor, bet
$20bn on a falling dollar, but now
insists he wasn’t wrong but prema-
ture; the right conditions still exist
and if it didn’t happen last year it will
happen in 2006.
Over the course of 2005 the US
Federal Reserve raised interest
rates to 4.25 per cent, as the econ-
omy grew at near 4 per cent and
high oil prices threatened to cause
inflationary pressures. The interest
rate differentials – 4.25 per cent in
the US and near-zero and 2 per cent
in Japan and the Euro-zone respec-
tively, gave the support to the dollar,
and the markets ignored the US
trade and budget deficits.

2006 Outlook
The prospects for 2006 look rosy.
The American economy is still grow-
ing in excess of 3 per cent a year,
and a recovery seems to have taken
hold in the stagnant Euro-zone and
Japanese economies. Meanwhile,
growth in developing markets – such
as Columbia – is strong, and fears of
a slow-down in Chinese economic
growth have faded.
Oil prices are predicted to fall to
around $40 to $50 a barrel in 2006,
but one stumbling block could be the
Sir Richard Brandson recently
announced a merger between Virgin
Mobile and cable company NTL, the
move would create an entertain-
ment and communications giant
worth £4.5bn. NTL chief executive,
Simon Duffy, approached Brandson
10 months ago and clandestine talks
continued between the two sides.
This culminated in a discussion with
T-Mobile, the German group, which
carries calls for Virgin Mobile on
its network. Completion is depend-
ent on the current merger between
NTL and Telewest. Ultimately, suc-
cess will form the UK’s first busi-
ness offering a package of mobile,
fixed line and television services.
The deal proposes a swap

stand-off with Iran over its nuclear
programme. Iran provides over 5
per cent of global oil production,
and with Saudi Arabia and the rest
of OPEC pumping at full capac-
ity already, they will be unable to
compensate for any shortfall in oil
supplies as they did during the Iraq
war. The global economy has coped
with $70 per barrel oil, but at the
$100 per barrel likely if Iranian oil
exports halt, the global economy
would suffer.
A bird-flu pandemic would spell
disaster for the global economy.
Economies would plunge into reces-
sion, and investors would sell bonds
and shares and move to the safety of
gold, cash and property.
For Britain however, the prospects
are less rosy. The economy had been
doing a lot better than the Euro-
zone, but economic growth fell to

just over 2 per cent. Many econo-
mists blame red-tape and high taxes
that are transforming the UK econ-
omy into a European-style economy.
Christmas brought little cheer for
many retailers – still suffering from
the high-street recession – and there
have been a record number of profit
warnings issued by companies from
all industry segments.
In the last week of December, the
“yield curve” inverted, meaning that
instead of being more expensive for
a government to borrow for 10 years
than it was for 2 years. The signifi-
cance of the inversion is that over
the past seventy years there have
been seven recessions, all of which
have been preceded by an inver-
sion of the yield curve. This may be
explained by the Federal Reserve’s
policy of increasing interest rates,
but put into context with the recent
rally in the price of gold (a safe
haven during recessions) the global
economy may be signalling weak-
nesses under the surface.
The final clouds on the horizon are
the trade imbalances, namely the
US trade and budget deficits, and
which are the highest in US history.
Oil exporting countries along with
China and other SE Asian coun-
tries have been buying dollars to
keep their currencies low, and their
exports cheap in the US, but if they
were to diversify away from dollars,
the imbalances would be unwound,
and are likely to do so abruptly and
painfully.
But look on the bright side, if there
were a major hick-up in the glo-
bal economy, there would be some
interesting fall-out. As Warren
Buffet once said, “its only when the
tide goes out that you can see who’s
swimming naked”.

Academics view the corporate
merger as a fulfilment of the econo-
mies of scale theory that stipulates
free markets tend towards having
as few companies and brand names
as possible. In summary, the theory
argues that by merging and growing
into large multinationals, compa-
nies’ production costs are reduced
for a number of reasons. On a sim-
plistic level, this is due to decreased
production costs permitted from
bulk buying for example. You may
then question the justification and
motivation for corporations in differ-
ent lines of business merging.
Initially, it would be appropriate to
briefly classify mergers. There are
fundamentally three kinds: the ver-
tical, horizontal and conglomerate
mergers. The horizontal kind is the
most simplistic and combines two
companies in the same line of busi-
ness, an example being Vodafone’s
acquisition of German telecommu-
nications giant Mannesmann. The
vertical variety involves companies
at different stages of production.
The buyer either expands the com-
pany back towards the source of raw
materials, or forwards in the direc-
tion of the consumer. For example,
Walt Disney acquired the ABC tel-
evision network with the intention
of airing recent production to large
audiences.
Theconglomeratemergerinvolves
companies in unrelated fields joining
forces. This variety was particularly
popular in the 1960s and 1970s, the
justification being costs might be
cut by sharing central services such
as accounting. In reality, unrelated
companies have struggled to cope
under the same corporate-manage-
ment umbrella and much of the cor-
porate banking action in the 1980s
pertained to the break up of the
conglomerates formed in the previ-
ous two decades.
Nevertheless, corporations are
under the influence of sharehold-
ers and top-management execu-
tives leading to dubious motives for
mergers. Brandson’s quest to form
a communications giant could be
viewed as analogous to the forma-
tion of AOL Time Warner in 2000.
This conglomerate made corporate
history with a record-breaking $156
billion worth of stock purchased by
AOL to acquire Time Warner. The
new company promised to fulfil the
consumer’s media and information
needs. Unfortunately profits in the
company slumped resulting in an
80% decline in the share value.
In the next issue, we shall exam-
ine the merger in more detail such
as the mechanics and technicalities
of the merger.
between Brandson’s 72% stake in
Virgin Mobile for 14% in the newly
formed giant that is intended to
be rebranded Virgin. Thus far an
NTL offer has been rejected by
Virgin Mobile minority share hold-
ers, valuing the company at £817m.
Brandson appeared on The Today
Programme, citing a £25m gap in
the value of the company. A rebut-
tal was issued to the UK Takeover
Panel for fear of the company’s cor-
porate governance being brought
into question.
Subsequently, NTL raised
the terms of its offer this Friday
to £930m.. To realise the merger,
Brandson is willing to reach into
his own pocket, bridging the gap
between what minority sharehold-
ers demand and the price NTL wish-
es to pay. At a cost of £9m.
