Posh Totty
+ Fucks like a horse
– Looks like a horse
Can be found in Chelsea
One of the advantages of being in
SW7 is the local talent. Posh birds
are usually impressed by money,
boats, and inbreeding, though if you
can be authentically downmarket
enough, she might fancy a bit of
rough.
Australian Barmaids
+ It’s easy...
– …but you have to speak to them
Found in Earls Court, Putney and
Belushi’s
Barmaids are fantastic. They lis-
ten to you moan, they’re usually
wearing something low-cut and they
give you booze. Aussie barmaids,
though a little bit annoying, have
the advantage of being a little easier.
Fair enough, it might be like throw-
ing a hotdog down a hallway, but

David Hasselhoff’s Sex Tips For Boys
New Year, New Hoﬀ
coﬀee break
coﬀee break
with David Hasselhoff
The Hoﬀ is back for 2006, and he’s going to get you laid. Thank him in kind.
So it’s 2006, and what have you got to
look forward to? Well, unlike we were
promised, there’ll be no flying cars,
sexy robots and talking sandwiches.
Instead we get £1.50 bus fares, dB’s
and another few months of Imperial-
bloody-College. Now, despite being
a 50-something Hollywood star, sex
symbol, lifeguard, secret agent and
crotch-model (not to mention my
stellar singing career in Germany),
I feel like I’ve remained in touch
with my Imperial College roots. I
graduated in ’73, having enrolled
as an easy way of dodging ‘Nam. It
was there that I met Devon Miles,
Brian May and my lifelong friend
and occasional lover, KITT. Imperial
has played a huge part in my career,
from my 1983 Knight Rider special
“Danger: Your name is Sherfield”,
to my sponsorship of Imperial’s
(short-lived) Baywatch appreciation
society, TitSoc. Now, writing Coffee
Break, I feel like I’m giving some-
thing back.
For the New Year it’s customary
for people to make some resolutions.
Typically you try to give up smoking,
get fit or some other pointless thing
that you’ll probably give up after a
week or two. Having spent half-a-
dozen years at IC (I failed a couple
of times – it can be hard to concen-
trate when you’re surrounded by so
much minge), I know what most of
the guy’s resolutions will be: to get
laid. I appreciate it’s not so easy
for you lot as it is for me. I’ve been
blessed with a thick mane of curly
chest hair, good, strong calves, and
an intimidating package. This week
I’m going to do my best to help the
men get their end away.
Before you actually get down to
the messy business called love-mak-
ing, you’re going to need to find
yourself a lucky lady. The important
thing here is to decide what type of
woman you’re after. A woman is a
subtle, beautiful thing, full of com-
plexities and nuances. However, as
I’m The Hoff, I’m going to generalise,
because hey, I’m David Hasselhoff
and I don’t play by nobodies rules.

Play your cards right, and this could be you
what more could you want?
Emo / Goth / Indie Girls
+ (Sometimes) Good Music Taste,
‘Interesting’ Dress Sense
- Mars Volta, Taking Back Sunday,
Other Emo crap
Can be found drinking Cider, not
dancing
Should you be that way inclined, a
nice Rocker chick can be a lot of fun.
Unfortunately, you’ll have to put up
with the occasional 20-minute exper-
imental Latin/Grindcore Fusion
drum solo. And they do tend to enjoy
moaning. But you can always take
comfort in the cold, metallic taste of
their clit ring.
So, you’ve found your victim. The
next step is to somehow persuade
her to get into bed with you - This
can be hard, especially if you’re
looking particularly Imperial that
day. The trick is to convince her
to see behind the acne, smell and
general creepy aura you project,
and to see the inner, beautiful per-
son. Or failing that, get her drunk,
so that maybe she’ll mistake your
inner pervert for an inner prince. Or
maybe you could get her even drun-
ker and it won’t even matter.
What if you don’t want unsatisfy-
ing drunken fumbling? Or you’re too
cheap to pay for a few Snakebites?
Some situations call for a little
charm, or as I call it, lying. Any
married man can tell you that the
one thing women want more than
anything (Apart from locking you
down, stealing your money and your
soul, and ruining the rest of your
life), is to be right. A girl who thinks
she’s right is a happy girl. So long
as you say the right words you’ll be
fine. Good phrases include ‘You’re
so right’, ‘I’m so wrong’ and ‘I like
Desperate Housewives, and I’m
straight’.
If you’ve been following these
instructions, then you should have
yourself a drunk and horny slag, on
the brink of becoming a hungover
and used shell of a woman. Well
done. Now it’s time for the impor-
tant bit. This is where most people
fail, as the fresh air, a sense of guilt
or a sudden burst of self-esteem hits
your lady, and makes her realise just
how stupid she’d been. Don’t let this
happen to you - now’s the time to
splash out on a taxi and get her back
to your gaff, ASAP
.
Wait a second - you did prepare
your room for the night of furious
lovemaking that’s in store? Are
there pants on the floor? Is there
an empty condom packet on the
bedside table? Is there a girlfriend
already in your bed? If you’re not
smart enough to deal with these
things beforehand, then you prob-
ably shouldn’t be at Imperial. Lock
her in the toilet, clean your room,
and let her out, declaring ‘The lock’s
a little stiff sometimes’. Emphasise
‘stiff’. Trust me, girls love that kind
of shit.
Well, it’s time for the main event.
Are you ready? Are your pubes
trimmed and your balls shiny? Are
you so drunk that this is going to
be like stuffing an oyster into a slot
machine? You need to focus your
mind and clear all your doubts. Do,
or do not. There is no try. Believe
in yourself and you can do it. Doubt
yourself and it’ll be three minutes of
old school missionary humping.
To help you out I’m going to share
some of the favourite positions that
I’ve picked up in my ‘career’.
- Doggy
- Catty
- Cowboy
- Reverse Cowboy
- Reverse, Reverse Cowboy, no
swap-backs
- The Dolphin
- The Surreptitous Indian
- The Chinese Burn
- The Isoceles Lock
That last one is particularly fruity.
All you really need to know though is
that if she falls asleep you’re doing it
wrong. But don’t let that put you off.
You’ve had a wonderful night of
faintly embarassing love-making.
The sun is shining through the
window, and you can see just how
ugly she was. Your cock is a bit
itchy, and there’s hair between your
teeth - and it’s neither of yours.
Congratulations.
“I like Desperate
Housewives, and I’m
straight.”
Breeding - that’s what matters
Ignore the voice - Focus on the Tit
I’m about to break!
