right and wrong, love conquers all
sort of attitude that cheapens many
good stories. No, ‘The New World’
is more complicated and thought
provoking than that.
Following what may be the
most popular and oldest legend in
America, the film opens with the
establishment of the English set-
tlement Jamestown by Captain
Where did Disney go wrong? And how did rehab Colin Farrell become John Smith?
Not another Pocahontas sequel!
Pocahontas is back in The New World next December.

N
ot so long ago, (actually
it was last-term), Felix
had a short video-clip
competition. The win-
ner (winners) of the
video-clip competition is the new
CIA-wannabes of Imperial College.
I have to say, I didn’t really under-
stand the item they were looking
for. So what exactly made them the
winner of the Felix video-clip com-
petition?
That’s easy, a steady hand, good
panoramic shots (I’m assuming it
was Hyde Park), and the extreme
seriousness of the actors’ faces when
they found the rock. I do admit that
the video-clip was in dire need of a
better script writer but otherwise,
watching the video-clip told me that
this is the winner. Congratulations
to Hamish Spender and his team!
They are the official winners of the
Felix video-clip competition.
Apart from the quality of the
video, the video-clip was surpris-
ingly hilarious. Of course, you will
guffaw at the sight of a plain rock
that apparently holds the secret to
what they were looking for. What
made it more hilarious were their
attempts to crack the code. Criss-
crossing their arms to type on two
different keyboards, taking huge
swallows of milk to maintain their
energy as they search for the great
answer- and all of this is done in
some strangely familiar hall-bed-
room. You have to give the guys
credit for having the ability to pull it
off with a straight face.
What do they win? 10 free Vue
tickets to see any show they like,
a crate of beer, DVDs (Kingdom
of Heaven, Robots and Hide and
Seek), Nightwatch tee-shirts and a
lot of other Fox goodies! Congrats,
guys!
Now, wouldn’t you love a piece of
that? I know, I do. Well, there will
probably be another video-clip com-
petition next year. Summer will be
here soon (I know, it’s a bloody long
six months away), take advantage
of the three month holday (yes-its
quite short, I do agree.) and make
a funny, entertaining video-clip and
maybe next year your video-clip and
your name will be in the papers!
Its interesting to see what Imperial
people get up to. Good luck!
It’s time to announce the winners
of the recent Felix Video-clip
Competition
A
word of notice: while
‘The New World’ is about
Pocahontas, it is quite
unlike the Disney ver-
sion. In fact, the name
‘Pocahontas’ is not said in the entire
film. I can only imagine that this is
an effort by the film to distance itself
from the popularized form of the leg-
end – the sort of good guy, bad guy,
Newport (Christopher Plummer).
Newport, in his wisdom, frees
Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell),
the party’s only professional soldier,
from imprisonment. While Newport
departs for England to bring fresh
supplies and men, Smith is sent to
make contact with Chief Powhatan
(August Schellenberg), the ruler
of the region’s native Indian tribe.
Smith is captured and about to meet
some terrible end when Powhatan’s
favourite daughter, Pocahontas
(Q’orianka Klicher) throws herself
upon Smith, and begs that his life
be spared.
Rather than portray this gesture
as motivated by ‘love at first sight’,
Mallick seems to prefer that it be an
act of compassion. The film is not a
story about heroes and villains; as
different as the British and Natives
are, the characters are all human,
and each show their individual vir-
tues and flaws. The conflict that
erupts between them is borne of
fear and misunderstanding – all too
human tendencies.
The second half of the movie
delves deeper into the character of
Pocahontas, and introduces John
Rolfe (Christian Bale) who begins
to notice the native girl after Smith
departs for England. Here, the film
tends to slow down considerably,
focusing more on the three principle
characters.
I suppose if I had to name some-
thing wrong with the movie, then it
would be that: it moves very slow-
ly. This must be partly intentional;
Mallick is fantastic at creating a sort
of meditative angst, complimented
by narration by the main characters.
The acting is first rate, develop-
ing the characters very well, and
Q’oriana Klicher’s performance as
the playful, expressive, and complex
Pocahontas comfortably steals the
show.
It’s an outstanding movie with tal-
ent to spare, but it’s not something
for the Friday-night after a long
week – it’d probably just make the
week seem even longer.
