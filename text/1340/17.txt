reflexes which have been imple-
mented without a critical analysis of
the problem.
Correlation with ethnicity does not
imply causality and I suspect that
the real cause of this rift can be
traced to poverty and not the colour
of one’s skin. In fact, I’m sure that
white children who attend dysfunc-
tional inner-city schools and come
from underprivileged backgrounds
are no more likely to be accepted to
universities than anyone else who
has not achieved a satisfactory level
of academic and social competence.
Lindi Galloway’s statements ech-
oed the real root of the problem,
which is that those demographics
who are underrepresented have
already been failed by society by
the time they reach university. To
place quotas on admission which
forces capable students to be turned
away while struggling students are
accepted does nothing but degrade
the quality of higher education. It
is a fundamentally flawed remedy
to nothing more than a symptom of
a deeper problem which is now in
danger of getting worse. Like giving

Star
Letter
Minority Students
To the Editor,
I read with surprise, both in Felix
and in other news sources, about
HESA’s alarm at the demograph-
ic anomalies between the general
population and university students.
What I find more alarming is the
responsibility which is being placed
on higher education institutions
with respect to this divide.
In my own personal experience,
universities are amongst the most
accepting and non-discriminatory
institutions in modern society; iso-
lated pockets which strive for pure
meritocracy. The quotas in place at
Cambridge and LSE are a shock-
ing display of bad science and are
exemplary examples of reactionary
a cancer patient an analgesic, this
sort of “remedy” leaves the patient
feeling better about themselves, but
merely masks the symptoms of the
cause while allowing the disease to
progress unabated. And, personally,
if I were a member of a minority
group, I would find it terribly insult-
ing to think that my admission was
a charity and not earned on merit.
To rob a person of that dignity is
divisive and condescending, in my
humble opinion.
The real solution will come
when politicians face the reality of
a deteriorating social and educa-
tional system and put programs to
work which aim to remedy them.
Underperforming primary and sec-
ondary schools need to be identified
and steps made to improve them.
Social programs for disadvantaged
families and parents need to be put
in place to help provide a stable
and positive environment for those
children and to help parents be
more effective. Only then will those
children stand a chance at being
prepared for the challenges of a uni-
versity education and only then can
we say that we have truly given all
people a real, fair chance.
Sincerely,

Ramadan Campaign
Dear students and staff,
If you can cast your minds back to
October you may remember ICU
Islamic Society’s ‘Save a nation’
charity campaign, our annual
Ramadan campaign, in which we
frantically collected for the south-
east Asian quake victims.
As with any relief process – the
tsunami, Katrina – sadly there were
shortcomings; I certainly felt frus-
tration and was disheartened when,
despite global efforts, there seemed
to be little progress, but I’m glad
to say that in the week I spent in
a medical camp and tent school in
Mansehra I met some very dedi-
cated and inspirational individuals
- foreigners and nationals alike.
Truly, it is the global support and
efforts of international govern-
ments and NGOs, in addition to the
Pakistani army and government,
that have brought the relief effort
this far. What’s more, with all this
foreign and government investment
the region shows promise of quality
education and new opportunities for
a brighter future.
I just wanted to say a (slightly
belated!) thank you to everyone
who helped and supported our
Ramadan campaign in coordination
with Islamic Relief; your contribu-
tions were important and together
we managed to raise over £15,000.
I would also like to mention that
there is still a lot going on; with
more than 80,000 dead, a lost gener-
ation (a reference to the thousands
of schoolchildren killed) and 3.5 mil-
lion left homeless, rehabilitation and
reconstruction are proving to be no
easy task; I urge you to continue to
support the relief effort in any way
possible.
