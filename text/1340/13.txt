LIVE REVIEWS
Originating in Switzerland, The
Young Gods have survived an almost
complete turnover of members with
the exception of the band found-
er, Franz Treichler; by the early
nineties they had achieved critical
acclaim and commercial success.
The Young Gods have gone against
the conventional rules of music,
replacing the commonplace guitar
with a sampler to introduce a new
electronic dimension to live music.
The Swiss trio refuse to be cat-
egorised by embracing all music
from classical to punk, obscuring
and fusing these opposing sounds
with such genius that although it
shouldn’t work, it does. Before last
Saturday we were unfamiliar with
this band, but trusting the opinion of
a good friend, decided to check out
what The Young Gods are all about.
On arrival, the venue was pret-
ty empty, but at 9.15pm the band
appeared on stage to a hoard of
screaming fans with barely enough
space to lift a pint. Their perform-
ance began as it was meant to, with
catchy up-beat tempos and under-
tones, expertly exploiting the sam-
pler to loop and layer diverse riffs
to achieve a gradual crescendo from
mellow to manic. With the contribu-
tion of strong beats by the drummer,
and Franz playing his vocals like
an instrument – sometimes sooth-
ing, sometimes screaming – the ulti-
mate outcome was that of a rich
and varied performance. The feel
of the night was slightly techno,
slightly rock, and fantastically edgy,
combined with an atmosphere brim-
ming with energy, both on stage
and in the audience. The Young
Gods expressed themselves not
only through their music, but took
full advantage of dramatic light-
ing to set a dark, almost hypnotic
mood, interjected by sudden bursts
of energy to keep the audience on
their toes. Gig-goers were treated to
an hour long set including numer-
ous classics such as the brilliant
Skinflower and Supersonic, along
with new songs to whip the audience
into a frenzy and firmly establish an
energetic mosh-pit.
With the melodramatic use of
light and sound, and their fervent
passion, the band really do provide
a show worth experiencing in the
flesh. If you closed your eyes, you’d
be forgiven for believing an entire
orchestra was performing. While
the whole futuristic feel may not
be to everybody’s taste, The Young
Gods prove that there is more to
music than simply adding lyrics to a
melody.

Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons, aka
The Chemical Brothers, are the pio-
neers of Big Beat - reaching the
levels of the infamous Fatboy Slim
and Death In Vegas. Yes, these are
big names, so shut up and put down
your panini.
The Chemical Brothers took delib-
erately artificial, robotic and rep-
etitious drumbeats and added rock-
style drum lines with individually
sampled loops. For the less musical-
ly astute, they created a deadly duo
of dance and guitar rock with the
energy to fill stadiums from Tokyo
to Chile and so became…. Super
Star DJs.
Being the dedicated reviewer that
I am, I decided to skip the Friday
night slut fest at Crush, smoke a
lot of hash and head to Brixton to
see what they were all about. Being
in no state to tell the time or read
a tube map and dragging along a
plus one that can’t do either on a
good day, I end up bizarrely being
a little early. This gave us plenty
of time to stand in the cold and
chat to some rather pilled-up short
Europeans and as far as I could tell
a Northerner, as he spoke funny and
couldn’t quite grasp the concept of
meaningful conversation (I’m north-
ern, you southern pansy – ed.).
Suddenly the sadistic doorman
received his mystic cue and opened
the doors. All immediate friendships
were forgotten, girlfriends were dis-
carded and it was every man for
himself. I ruthlessly made my way
to the stalls, which are by far the
best seats in the house - not because
you’re actually allowed to stand and
dance but because there are four
bars in one room. God bless this
nation of drunken rabble.
Any Chemical Brothers album
is always a journey through mes-
merizing guitar riffs, block rockin’
beats, wicked samples and huge
breakdowns. Tonight clearly wasn’t
going to be an exception. DJ James
Holroyd had the honour of open-
ing up and provided a backdrop of
early, simplistic house and techno
that spawned the new generation
of energetic DJs that rocked the
house into an ecstatic state of pure
euphoria.
Caged Baby took to the stage
donning tight leather in true camp
glam-rock style. Playing live and
providing deep, guitar-lead techno
that would put a smile on Frankie
Knuckles’ face.
A host of lush melodies and softer
dance grooves fell on eager ears as
anticipation of the chemical gods
grew to immense hysteria. All fell
quiet as psychedelic laser beams
filled the academy. A silent whisper
ran across the floor. The Chemical
Brothers had arrived.
The intro was bass-heavy and a
little rugged but it will be inter-
esting to see how it develops into
an album track. Digging into their
back catalogue, Hey Boy Hey Girl
exploded into the smoky atmos-
phere. Stunning visuals in sync with
the music projected over the throng
of heads, exploding bubbles, scary
clowns, marching robots and other
trippy shit.
Chart topping tracks from Push
The Button, Dig Your Own Hole
and Exit Planet Dust featured
heavily across the set while peri-
odically dropping into their deeper,
non-released and more expressive
works.
The mighty Dust Brothers had
emotional control of five thousand
people, turning them into one
immense euphoric flow of energy,
manipulating the mood of the crowd
and using them as an instrument
within itself. This is what they are
famed for. They truly are the mas-
ters of the arena-sized sound.
George X
Clad in pink lycra catsuits and with
‘Halagoogoo’ emblazoned across
their stomachs, please welcome
the warm up act for tonights gig.
To chants of ‘Hal-a-goo-goo, Hal-
a-goo-goo’, the band pumped out
a range of upbeat funky tunes and
wholeheartedly entered into the
Christmas spirit, with their glitter
adorned faces and tossing crackers
into the crowd. With their enthusi-
asm and catchy tunes, these guys
are bound to become a well known
name on the London circuit.
Come 10.15 and Milk Kan make
a modest entrance; it is evident by
their casual dress and manner that
these guys are not buying into the
whole ‘product’ ethos of the music
industry. With the crowd warmed
up, they wasted no time with small
talk during their set, and allowed
their unadulterated rawness to
speak volumes. Milk Kan provide
a wonderfully weird blend of satiri-
cal poetry, part-sung, part-recited to
simple tunes. The journey of aspir-
ing to fame has seen these cheeky
chaps jet off from South London to
New York and back again, along the
way recruiting further band mem-
bers to generate Milk Kan as we see
them today. Named after the famous
Houdini milk can escape, they are
perhaps implying that all in life is
not quite as it seems, and ultimately
give a refreshing uncensored take
on modern ways. Noone is safe
from the wrath of Milk Kan’s wicked
wit, yet they somehow get away
with it, using their cheeky appeal
to go places others wouldn’t dare.
Obvious comparisons to be made
are that of Milk Kan to the Streets,
combined with the down-to-earth
appeal of GLC and somewhere deep
down I am sure I felt the influence
of Blur. Make what you will of them,
you have to give Milk Kan credit for
their fantastically deadpan attitude
towards the music industry. Forget
the wishy-washy lyrics favoured
by many bands today: these guys
waste no time on menial subjects
such as love. Instead, their lyrics
are completely bizarre, though if
you listen carefully you may begin
to understand what was possibly
not intended to be understood in the
first place.
It truly was a shame that the audi-
ence was not larger; though the boys
appeared not to care, and despite,
as we were later informed, the set
being plagued by technical hitches,
this went unnoticed by the crowd
and the set flowed smoothly. With
their hilarious lyrics and catchy
tunes they definitely deserve more
appreciation. I can picture a room
jam packed with bouncing revellers;
if you are after that happy-go lucky,
feel good factor then Milk Kan are
the guys for you.
