Working for an investment bank is demanding – which is why we look
for people who are cool under pressure, work well in a team and take
pride in delivering high quality work on time every time.
The kind of people, in fact, who never miss a deadline. If you’re keen to
find out whether a career with Credit Suisse is right for you, make sure you
apply for our Summer Internship Program by 20 January 2006
and it could be the start of a highly rewarding long-term relationship.
