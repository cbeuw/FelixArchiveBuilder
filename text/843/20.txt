AS A STUDENT
YOU HAVE THIS PRIVILEGE
Students command preferential terms from many
financial institutions because of their future
earning potential.
For example, banks and insurance companies offer
unusually attractive terms to students to encourage
their return after graduation.
It is in your interest to take full advantage of such
offers throughout your student life, since you will
not be able to obtain similar terms after graduation.
S.G.F.P.D. Ltd., have been advising students on
financial matters for 18 years, and we can, for
example, show you a way of guaranteeing a top-
up to a 100% mortgage after graduation, so you
do not have to save a deposit for your first house
purchase.
You will also qualify for our 'grant rebate' of up
to £330 whilst you are a student, and we will be
pleased to provide details of this and advise on the
amount to which you will be entitled.
To make the most of your privileged position,
complete the attackedpre-paid enquiry card and
we will advise by return of post.
