University Christian Outreach
at Imperial College
. Welcomes you to a new term
UCO is a group of students who wish to live as faithful
Christians, promoting the life of Christ among us and seeking
to make known to others the hopes and challenges of the
Christian faith and life in the Holy Spirit.
We are Anglicans, Catholics, Orthodox & non-
denominational students who stand together to express the
unity Christ calls us to. We believe that if God so loves each
of us, we can so love one another.
UCO believes God is alive today, and among us here. Not
because we're so great, but because He is....
