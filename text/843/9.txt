Don't get in a rut and lock yourselfin your room during Freshers' Week. Go out and make the most o
life; join a club, laugh a lot or just get pissed.
FRESHERS' GUIDE
Freshers' Week begins with a mass registration from
9 'til 4 in the Junior Common Room, Sherfield
Building. You will need your registration slip to obtain
your IC Union Card and, more importantly, your grant
cheque (also available in the JCR). Union cards will
be available from the Senior Common Room in the
Union Building from 9 'til 5 each day except Tuesday.
It is well worth registering as quickly as possible since
registration will only be possible through room 343
from 12 O'clock Tuesday.
Once the formalities are over there is an address
from the Rector, Professor Eric Ash at 10.30 on
Monday, followed by CCU General Meetings in the
afternoon. Monday evening's entertainment is
outlined on page 12. Suffice it to say that this is the
best chance for you to 'get out there and meet
people.'
Tuesday is everybody's chance to find a new
pastime or follow an old one by touring the vast array
of clubs and societies at the Freshers' Fair. The main
point of Freshers' Fair is that nobody is allowed to take
money from you at the Fair-many clubs will actually
let you try out their activity for free before joining; ask

Wednesday marks the beginning of most courses
with a Comedy night in the evening to offer a contrast
to the rest of the day, more details are on page 12

Friday, if you're still conscious, sees a big party in
the Union Building to allow you to meet all those
people whose names you still can't remember from
Monday. With the ensuing hangover you can do a
good deed and have fun to boot by tiddlywinking
down Oxford Street. If you've made it that far through
Freshers' week, well done; maybe you'd like to see
how Marlowe, the FELIX private eye found his first
day last year.
It had been a hard week, the kind of week that slugged
you across the face and made off with your bus pass,
and I was on atough case. I had been hired to
investigate Imperial College's Fresher's Week.
It started on Monday. The place was full and I tried
toblend in with the crowd. It didn't work: students
don't weartrenchcoats and carry loaded Colt 45s. I
was in a hurry and I don't deal with small fry. I had
to see the man at the top, the big cheese, the man
called 'The Rector'.
For once, lady luck was on my side: the word was
that The Rector would be at a joint called the Great
Hall at 10am. I got there at 9. The place was empty
so I went away and came back an hour later.
Now the place was packed. At the far end of the
room I could just see the white haired figure of The
Rector. He was speaking but it didn't make much
sense. He was talking about something called 'hard
work' but no-one seemed to be listening. It was then
it hit me. I had been given a double dose of boredom.
The world went hazy and I collapsed. No one seemed
to notice.
I woke up, I looked around. The place was like Skid
Row without the charm. I must have been at the New
Year Party. I stood up, my legs objected. I sat down
again. 'Hey,' I said to a nearby kneecap, 'where am
I?' The kneecap glared at me in a kneecap sort of way
and said nothing. I hit it, I was hurt so was the
kneecap. It's owner bent down to look at me. He had
the kind of face which made you glad to be just plain
ugly.
I nose-bashed his fist and hit him on the foot with
my groin. He didn't give in so I passed out. It was the
only passing I was going to be doing for quite some
time.
