Just ten pounds buys you entry to all of the Freshers' Week events below. Entertainment
fills in the details....

Firstly, I must remind anyone who has ordered
Freshers' Week tickets or Ents Cards (or both] to
collect them from the Union SCR Monday morning or
afternoon-you will not be able to collect them on the
door on Monday night. Anyone who has not bought
a ticket, shame on you, the only way you can redeem
yourself is to buy one from the Union Office or the
Union SCR today.
What have we got lined up for you then? Only one
of the best Freshers' Weeks in England. We start off
on Monday 2nd October (tonight) with the New Year
Party. This is headlined by The Four Brothers, the best
band to come out of Zimbabwe. They have been
getting a lot of press lately with the release of their
highly acclaimed second LP 'Bros', and are one of
John Peels fave bands; "The guitar playing has been
known to make grown men cry"—John Peel. They
are an excellent dance band.
Also in the Concert Hall is The Woodchildren who
are four lovable mop-tops from Merseyside. With their
unique dibbley guitar sound they have plucked their
way into our major Freshers' Week slot after a run of
major London Polytechnic dates. They replace
Syndicate who recently split up. Check out the new
album Shopaholic, it's great!
But that is only half of it. We have two excellent
bands preforming in the Lounge. One of them, The
Sandkings are soon to be touring with the Wonder
Stuff and have a similar sound to REM. The other, The
Katydids are an indipop band recently signed to a
major record company.
But don't take my word for it-come and see for
yourself. Also on the Monday we have a crazy mix
of late bars, very late discos, films and fun which all
go together to provide an unbeatable night's
entertainment.
Wednesday is Comedy Night when you can see
some of the best alternative comedy on the circuit.
We have Wack andZan, a hilarious juggling act, Felix,
an impressive stand up comedian and Sean Hughs,
an entertaining impressario. The night is compered by
Ivor Dembina.
The week is rounded off by the big party on Friday,
the Freshers' Ball (don't bring your dinner jackets, it's
not that sort of Ball). This is in a similar vein to the
Monday night with late bars, late discos, food and fun.
This night features some of the best party bands in
town. Headlining is the Big Town Playboys, old
favourites of Imperial College, and supporting them
is the Jivin' Instructors, you may have seen their
names on walls around London! We also have Dave,
Puppy and the Happy Dogs-a band to miss at your
peril.
So this is what's on-how much does it cost?
Monday and Friday night are £5 each and Wednesday
is a mere £3. You can, of course, buy a week ticket
for £ 10 that gives you guaranteed entrance to all three
nights. Tickets can be bought on the door (but please
be early to avoid disappointment) or from the Union
SCR or Union Office on Monday.
So when Freshers' Week is over what other events
are Ents putting on?
Every Friday night (bar the first one) Ents put on a
regular 'Lounge' feature. This involves a band or
cabaret act along with the Lounge disco and late bar.
The cost of these will be anything from £2.50 to
nothing. There will also be larger Carnivals once or
twice a term along the same lines as the Freshers Ball.
This brings up the subject of Ents Cards. These give
you reduced admission to all the Ents events except
Freshers' Week. Large savings can be made for the
initial £7 it will cost for the Ents card.
If you want to get involved with the Ents crew you
can see us at the Freshers' Fair where you can get
some information about us. Sign up, it's great!!!
