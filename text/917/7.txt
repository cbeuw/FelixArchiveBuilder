Humanist Morals
The Evolutionary Basis o f Morals.
Humanists claim that morality is
built on human nature, not G o d .
Religion does not have a monopoly
on morals and ethics. H o w can this
be achieved?
Why be moral? What is morality?
H o w on Earth do human beings
come to have morality? These are
basic questions. Evolution makes
particular difficulty for the third
question, for morality sometimes
requires altruistic behaviour - how
can animals who evolved according
to Darwin's theory have come to
behave like that?
These question certainly require
sensitive and subtle thinking. T h e
second question gets to the roots o f
the matter. It has two parts: What
is it that discriminates the right act?
W h y does this, whatever it is that
does this job, have the authority to
demand that we act accordingly?
T h e scientific understanding o f
naturalistic evolution states: O n e
cannot derive a value judgement
from a factual statement. T h e
Humanist accepts Hume's Law, and
at the same time claims that
evolution is the key that unlocks the
door to morality. That metaphor, of
a key to understanding, is the
answer.
A theory o f morality (theistic or
naturalistic) will point to something
which (it claims) is ultimately
important; it is valid if what it points
to is ultimately important, and if the
theory draws the right conclusions.
T h e Humanist claims that evolution
gives us the right understanding o f
what it is to be human, so that we
have the basis from which to draw
the right moral conclusions.
The above questions will be
discussed (and answered?) in a talk
by Harry Stopes-Roe on Thursday
21st N o v at l p m in Huxley 340.
Harry Stopes-Roe took his first
degree in Physics at the R C S and
then did Astrophysics research here
and then Cambridge, but switched
to Philosophy - his doctorate. H e
then lectured at B i r m i n g h a m
University on " S c i e n c e Studies":
what science has done to/for us.
Importantly, science (for him) has
destroyed the credibility of a theistic
view o f the Universe. So, how to
make sense o f Life Morality? The
obvious answer for h i m was
Humanism. This is his " l i f e -
stance" (a term he originated)
which he spent much o f his later
years lecturing on. He also became
involved with the British Humanist
Association, being its chair for a
number o f years.

Dribbling
Champs
The Dribblers continued their fine
run o f victories with a stunning
t r i u m p h o v e r H a m m e r s m i t h
Hospital last Sunday. H a v i n g
obviously heard o f the Dribblers
r e p u t a t i o n , o n l y eight
Hammersmith girls dared to turn
out for the 10-0 thrashing.
Caroline started off the scoring
with a goal in the first few minutes
which was almost as amazing as her
miss later on in the half. Other goals
in the game came from Permi (7)
and Jo (2) with near misses from
Sara, Arlene and Rachael.
Ethel played a blinder in defence,
as usual??!!??, as did Arlene who
was playing her first game for the
team. Credit must also go to the
goalie E m m a , who kept a clean
sheet and would surely have made
some amazing saves had any shots
come her way. Hammersmith, quite
sensibly, didn't attempt to challenge
the Dribblers in a boat race!
Finally, the Dribblers would just
like to congratulate Ethel, albeit a
little late, for her amazing header
off the line in the K C H C u p game.
Ethel you're a star, where would
the team be without you... top o f
the league probably!!!
