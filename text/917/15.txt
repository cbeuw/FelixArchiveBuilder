Carter USM/lnspiral Carpets/Family Cat
— Brixton Academy
s = e ^ s it with anger and
First on, the Family Cat. Next, The
Inspiral Crapets. In the words of
John Peel -'What do you think of
the programme so far?'
R - U - B - B - I - S - H
Now Carter are reviled and
revered in equal doses, so why are
they revered? Because they play
pop, with humour, with style, with
grace, with showmanship (Phil
Schofield, Jon Beast), and because
their music varies from slow to
speed, from sad to celebratory,
from G.I. Blues and Prince In A
Pauper's Grave to Rubbish and
Sheriff Fatman. Their masterstroke
is at the moment, their cover of
their support's This Is How It Feels,
a cover which both retains the
original's atmosphere, but attacks
it with anger and feeling so
apparently m i s s i n g f r o m the
Inspirals' version. This IS how it
feels to be lonely. A n d G o d ' s not
dead, no, he is alive, and kicking,
and living in Sarf London.
N o w our h i g h l y r e g a r d e d
shithead of an music editor doesn't
like Carter. But I think you all know
exactly what he does like. Cramps
and Cranes, and his lord M r .
Eldritch. Now I think the Sisters did
a one of the better shows at
Reading, and that Carter were off
form there. But that was then and
this is now. The reason he doesn't
like them is because you can hear
the words, there's not just a solid
wall of feedback, that any halfwit
with an amp could create, because
they have a sense of humour,
because they've got life and he's
just dying to get one. Ladies and
G e n t l e m e n , a toast: T h e

The Senseless Things
-Delmar 12"
Post-pop-punk or post-punk-pop.
If, indeed, the highly questionable
practice of labelling bands as
conforming to genres was ethically
equitable, then either tag would suit
The Senseless Things. Melodic
guitars? H u m . Simplistic Vocals?
Yeah!.
They really are a cliche, but at
least you'll know what you'll get -
the same sort of thing that made the
Mission so endearing - pretty much
the same as last time. T h e same
hyperactive croon about teenage
r o m a n c e and f l o p p y - f r i n g e d
frippery, the same chunky guitar
c h o p p i n g , so r e m i n i s c e n t o f
Discharge and all punk spawn from
across the big pond.
Shock Horror! it's an acoustic
number, fwuffy music from the
kings of cliche. I suppose they do
it fairly well, but honestly, it's not
entirely memorable (neither are the
rest of the tracks). The Senseless
Things have been stuck in the same
groove since the itchingly catchy 'Is
is too late' and the general produce
of that era ('era' is too big a word
for it, really). Maybe it's time
someone told them it's 1991, but
who knows; in the great scheme of
things, this kind of retrogressive
nonsense may yet see it's own
grubby face exposed again. O h ,
how sweet, how fleeting, how fickle
public favour is. Boys, don't hold
your breath.
The grinnin' twins.
Candyland
— Kingdom
In some hideous dreamscape in my
head, all three versions of Kingdom
are soundtracking my distorted
visions as they jerk from surreal
blurs to brief glimpses of reality that
are horrifically confusing. Only
kidding, they're not really. It would
probably be a different story if I was
stoned, but this is not the case.
Honest.
Kingdom is still rather fine, a
drunken, hypnotic dancefuhrer for
those times when the strobes start
a-flickering and the world goes that
little bit more blippy than usual,
pulsing with an irregular regularity.
The other side's quite enjoyable,
too, but I can't see them bringing
anything new to the party.
David.
Carter rear their ugly heads again.
The Cassandra Complex
—The War Against Sleep
If you're a Eurobeat/Industial/
Techno freak, you'll know the
meaning of Speed, Coke ( T M ) ,
mania, more speed etc and buy this
anyway. For the uneducated, The
Cassandra Complex dare to fuse
harsh guitars and electro-mania in
an atomic cocktail. H o w dare you
apathetic bastards i g n o r e
Theomania and force them to
migrate to Hamburg?
The Cassandra Complex spit,
growling scepticism. Yes, Death
sells. The Utah Saints proved that,
so What Can I Do For You? Love?
Huh. Rather, One Millionth Happy
Customer. G i v e me ' l i v e '
computers and sequencers any
night.
Bands always feel obliged to
follow the pack identity. Thrash,
electro, indie bop (yugh) hence the
schizophrenia syndrome, ' W h o
shall we pretend to be?' With JVine
Inch Nails, they are one of the few
others who ' d i s c o v e r e d ' that
terrored live guitar can exist at the
same time as diseased ' l i v e '
technology. Well you may cower,
you brain-numbed and blind trend
disciples.
However, as a consolation to the
Lost, The Cassandra Complex
create their own Atmosphere for a
finale. This is a Lullaby For The
First Baby Born In Outer Space.
This is the Cyberpunx revolution.
