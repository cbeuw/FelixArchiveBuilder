1 Felix 917 Union
The best way to describe the
Union Committee structure is as an
onion: a complex layered structure
o f c o m m i t t e e s , p o w e r and
responsibility. T r y i n g to cut
through the layers and trace its
workings can bring tears to your
eyes. In this, and following articles,
the Union will be peeled apart layer
by layer.
Definition of Terms
Union Officers: These are unpaid,
elected students that are responsible
for a small area of the U n i o n ' s
activity, and answerable to the
U n i o n General Meeting ( U G M ) .
These include Transport, Publicity,
Post-Graduate Affairs, Housing,
Welfare, Rag, Ents, W o m e n ' s and
many others.
Sabbaticals: These are paid
U n i o n Officers that work full time
for the U n i o n . The U n i o n Office
sabbaticals are responsible for the
day to day running of the U n i o n .
This includes responsibility for the
major areas of the U n i o n ' s work
and to represent the students on
College committees. T h e final
sabbatical is the Print U n i t
Manager/Felix Editor, who ensures
that the Union can produce publicity
and documents at the appropiate
time.
Students are a u t o m a t i c a l l y
members of Imperial College Union
(ICU) and for whose benefit the
Union is run. A n y student has the
right to attend any U n i o n meeting
where they will have observing
rights, except disciplinary hearings.
Speaking rights are given at
U G M / E G M ( E x t r a o r d i n a r y
General Meetings) and at the
chairperson's discretion.
The Union General Meeting
T h e most p o w e r f u l U n i o n
organisation is the U G M . These
must be held at least once a term,
and it is here that the students of
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e U n i o n are
represented. E G M s can be called by
anyone if they collect the signatures
of at least 100 U n i o n members. A t
every meeting there must be 250
people to satisfy quorum - a mere
4% of the student population. A l l
the U n i o n Officers and sabbaticals
must attend to be questioned on
their written reports (the Felix
Editor does not submit a written
report), after which they are
normally accepted. T h e U n i o n
Executives usually present a few
terse sentences to explain their
actions of the last month. The
Officers are then subjected to an
intensive questioning session from
the floor, after which the report is
passed.
Once all the reports have been
passed the motions, submitted by
any student in advance to the
Chairperson, are debated and voted
upon. If passed they become Union
L a w and must be obeyed by all
officers. These can cover such
diverse topics as the role of women
at IC, and what can be done to
service their needs, to the mental
stability and competence of the
Felix Editor or any other sabbatical.
Motions are easy produce and can
range from the serious to the very
silly. Anything can be proposed,
but whether it is passed depends on
the attenders at the U G M . Recent
highlights include an attempt for
sabbatical salaries to be increased
to £20,000, and a motion defining
the U n i o n stance on student loans.
Here is an example of a motion:
• I C U Notes: 1. That the President
glows too brightly in diffuse
sunlight and/or ultraviolet light. 2.
That the Deputy President is always
well dressed. 3. That the H o n
Sec(Events) has no dress sense at
all. 4. That the Felix Editor ought
to wear cleaner trousers.
• I C U Believes: 1. A smart
u n i f o r m w o u l d i m p r o v e the
appearance of the sabbaticals at
their frequent public displays and
around their respective work places.
• I C U Resolves: 1. That standard
sabbatical uniforms should be
designed. 2. Sizes suitable for all
the sabbaticals to be purchased.
• I C U Instructs: 1. A l l sabbaticals
must wear their appropiate uniform
at all times.
A l l motions are based on these 4
parts: factual information, the
reason for the motion, the aims of
the motion, and how that motion
will be implemented. They must
also have a proposer and seconder.
Council
This is a more streamlined version
of a U G M with all the. students
represented by their departmental
representatives, through their
societies by their respective Major
Sub Committee ( M S C ) , and by
their Constituent College U n i o n
( C C U ) — C i t y & Guilds College
U n i o n , Royal School of Mines
U n i o n , Royal College of Science
U n i o n or St M a r y ' s Hospital
Medical School U n i o n . A l l U n i o n
Officers are answerable to these
meetings and must attend.
Debate can be very vigorous
when major issues are being
discussed. Recently one of the first
motions to reach the floor was to
ban smoking at Council and all
U n i o n Committees. T w o out of the
four sabbaticals were vigorously
opposed to this motion, and they
retaliated by amending the motion
to include the eating of chocolate.
This was passed, annoying both the
President, and M a r c Ellis (a.k.a.
Penguin, Rag Chairman), who
spent the rest of the meeting sniffing
at his chocolate bar.
Major Sub Committees (MSC)
The purpose of the six M S C s is to
represent the interests of the
students through their clubs and
societies affiliated to I C U . T h e
Social, Cultural and Amusements
Board ( S C A B ) is responsible for all
o f e n t e r t a i n m e n t s o c i e t i e s .
Publications Board (Pub Board)
represents the media societies, i.e.
print, radio and television. T h e
Athletics Clubs Committee ( A C C )
represents all the sports teams that
play in leagues. Recreational Clubs
Committee ( R C C ) is in charge of
all clubs that indulge in recreational
a c t i v i t i e s . O v e r s e a s C l u b s
Committee (OSC) provides a social
structure for foreign students.
Finally the Social Clubs Committee
is responsible for religious, political
and p r e s s u r e g r o u p s , and
miscellaneous societies.
Union Finance Committee (UFC)
This very important committee
always guarantees vigorous debate
as everyone scrambles for the few
pennies tossed into the air by the
Deputy President (DP) who is the
chairman of these meetings. T h e
biggest hot potato this year was
deftly handled by the D P when
r e s p o n s i b i l i t y f o r m s w e r e
discussed. T h e s e forms were
created by last year's sabbaticals to
define who in the U n i o n is
responsible for the organisation of
events, and the activities of the
societies. Their implementation this
year led to one resignation in an
M S C and threats of many others.
