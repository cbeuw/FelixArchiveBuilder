Goodfeiias Environmental Soc
Next Thursday evening FilmSoc is
p r o u d to present the h i g h l y
acclaimed GoodFellas. based on the
book Wiseguy, the true story of
mafia supergrass H e n r y H i l l ,
GoodFellas is an epic study of the
mob over a 30-year period.
Ray Liotta ('Field of Dreams')
plays Henry H i l l , the handsome
Irish youth adopted by his thuggish
elders despite his total ignorance of
all things mafioso. With the help of
psychotic hardman T o m m y DeVito
(Diminutive Joe Pesci of ' H o m e
A l o n e ' fame) and the enigmatic
Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) he
s o o n p i c k s up the essential
requirements for the job, namely
the ability to give a good kicking,
a total contempt for the law and an
appetite for women and liquor.
Violent in the extreme, and driven
along by a classic sound-track, the
film manages to hold a relentless
grip over more than two hours.
The film marks a magnificent
return to form by the acting-
directing duo of Robert D e N i r o and
Martin Scorsese, responsible for
cinematic classics such as Taxi
Driver and Raging Bull.
The film will be shown at 7.30pm
on Thursday the 21 st November in
M e c h E n g 220. Admission will be
80p for F i l m S o c members and
£1.80 for n o n - m e m b e r s .
Membership of the society costs
£ 6 . 0 0 , w h i c h i n c l u d e s an
entitlement to see one film free.

E n v i r o n m e n t and A p p r o p r i a t e
Technology Society present D r
John G r i b b i n , N e w Scientist

on the Greenhouse Effect and
Climatic Change.
John Gribbin graduated from the
Sussex University and then went on
to Cambridge University where he
was a w a r d e d his P h D in
astrophysics, having researched into
the properties of very dense stars.
In 1970 he received the First Award
of the Gravity Research Foundation
of New Boston (a rather obscure
award) and joined the editorial staff
of Nature. In 1974 he received
Britain's premier science writing
prize - The National Award - for his
work on climatic change. In 1975
he joined the Science Policy
Research Unit of the University of
Sussex with a team studying the
likely impact of climatic change on
world food supplies and since 1978
he has been the Physics consultant
for the New Scientist. He has
written regularly for The Times and
The Guardian, has broadcast on
B B C W o r l d Service and Radio 2
and was an adviser for the Thames
Television documentary on the
greenhouse effect (back in 1983).
So, if you want to hear all this
again come along to M e c h E n g 220
at 12.45pm, or five minutes later if
you don't!

Do-it-yourself frontal lobotomy; the Unleichlich Manoeuvre.
F o r those who didn't turn up, you
missed an excellent night out. F o r
those who did here's a refresher of
the binge.
Nobody from U C L turned up, so
the original route was scrapped.
After a failed attempt to get into
International Hall's bar (thanks for
trying Paul!) we left the U L U bar
and made for 'The Sun'. F r o m
there it was the quickest route to
' T h e George' taking in whatever
pubs we hit along the way. One of
particular note was ' T h e Swan'
where it was karaoke night. There
was too much temptation to resist
this, and after some persuasion
from Keith, the U L U president, we
managed to jump the queue. About
fifteen of us then treated the pub to
a rendition of 'Sweet C h i l d of
M i n e ' . After a quick pint or two it
was then on to ' T h e George'. T h e
m o r e i n t r e p i d o f the b u n c h
continued on to 'The Astoria' and
who knows what went on there. I
didn't - I couldn't afford it.
There will probably be a trip back
to 'The Swan' for the next karaoke
night while many other events are
being planned, so watch the notice
board for details.
