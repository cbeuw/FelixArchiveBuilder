Sponsorship Hypnosis Lecture
T u e s d a y w i l l d e f i n i t e l y be
momentous. In past years, for no
apparent reason, the U n i o n staff
have never been a c t i v e l y
encouraged to participate in Rag
Week. Bit of a shame really, seeing
as how they're just as crazy as the
rest of us. A n y w a y , for the whole
of Tuesday, Cathy and Michelle,
who work behind the main desk in
the U n i o n office, will be dressed as
T w e e d l e - D u m and Tweedle-Dee
for the whole day. This promises to
be a great spectacle so go up and
see 'em,and while you're up there
chuck some money in their Rag
can. They're being sponsored to do
it, so if you see them before
Tuesday put your name on their
form.
Next Friday is the City of London
sponsored pub crawl, with people
being sponsored per pint in each
pub. If you want to join in, or just
come along on the day, come to
today's Rag meeting to find out the
details.
Next Saturday, as you are no
doubt aware by now, is the
i n f a m o u s S p o n s o r e d N u d e
K a m i k a z e Parachute J u m p . If
you're around on the day go out and
cheer. T h e r e ' s nothing m o r e
embarrassing than having a hundred
or so people cheering as you run (or
walk) naked from Harrods on a
Saturday morning.
You will be there!
O n Thursday of Rag Week at
8.30pm, the Hypnosis Lecture will
take place in the Great Hall. If
you've ever seen Martin S. Taylor,
hypnotist and magician, then I
expect you'll be back to see him
again. If you haven't, then by all
means go!
The first half of the evening is the
'lecture'. Martin S. Taylor explains
the history and practice of hypnosis,
and throws a few jokes in for no
extra charge. This is possibly the
only interesting lecture ever to
occur within any university but the
real fun starts in the second half of
the evening.
Some people regard hypnosis in
the same light as astrology,
demonology and corn circles. It's
not. It is a genuine feature of the
human m i n d that it may be
hypnotised, and hypnosis is used as
a modern medical tool. I have seen
someone I know plunge a surgical
needle into the back of their hand
while under hypnosis and they did
not feel any pain. Trust me, it's for
real.
It's also great fun to watch.
Martin S. Taylor will be doing a lot
Services
of great hypnosis tricks and he will
attempt to hypnotise anybody who
wishes to be hypnotised. But don't
be afraid of coming along, as he
won't do anything to you too evil
without your permission. If you
want to see this, or be part of it,
then come along.
But the best bit of any hypnosis
show is watching people you know
do very, very silly things. L i k e
forgetting their own name. O r
forgetting that the number 7 exists
('count to ten' 'one two three four
five six eight nine ten' 'how many
dwarves were there?' 'eight' 'name
t h e m ' — a n d he did!). Watching

N o not the religious type, or the
mechanical type, but the type that
you get done to other people during
Rag W e e k (all at a small cost, for
charity of course). Services include
the following:
G n o m i n g , G r i m - r e a p i n g ,
H a n d c u f f - o - g r a m s and P i n t - a -
grams. These are obtainable via the
R C S office (ext 8675) and are a
fiver each.
Hit Squad (flanning) will be
available from the Guilds' office
(ext 8673) at £1.50 for students and
£5 for lecturers and notables.
If you're not sure exactly what
these services entail, give the
relevant office a ring and they'll be
only too happy to tell you.
Bulk discounts are likely to be
available with a little haggling.
Hall Reps & Conga
If you're in hall and wish to know
what's happening then the easiest
way is by contacting your Rag Hall
Representative. These are as
follows:
Bernard Sunley - Matthieu Pinel
(ext 325) Michael Chamberlain (ext
303); Falmouth Keogh - Andrew
M c C a l l (ext 728); Fisher - Beccy
Land (ext 406); Garden - Tamsin
Braisher (ext 828); Linstead - M a r k
Bunyan (ext 773); Selkirk - D e m i
Jones (ext 748); Southwell - Sarah
Hortop; T i z a r d - Lorrie Butler (ext
751); Weeks - Sandip Mehta; Willis
Jackson - Stuart Rison (ext 260).
A l s o contact them about any
stupidities that you may wish to try
in name of charity (that goes for
during the rest of the year as well).
Don't forget to come and join the
rest o f the halls this Sunday
afternoon at 3.00pm in Princes
Gardens for the biggest Conga that
we can manage. It should be a good
laugh and no-one does anything on
a Sunday afternoon anyway. W e
may also try another couple of
sillies like a Caterpillar race (if you
don't know what this involves don't
worry, very few people do) which
should also prove to be great fun.

Rag Goodies are Here
Andrew Wensley blunder across the
stage in what he thought was a thick
fog, bump into a wall that wasn't
there and then search for the
invisible door was one of the most
funny things I have ever seen.
D o come along. Tickets will cost
£3.50 at the door. D o get up if you
want to be hypnotised. O h yes,
there's one big advantage in being
one of the final few on s t a g e -
Martin S. Taylor usually leaves his
'volunteers' with a suggestion that
water will taste like their favourite
alcoholic drink, and will get them
drunk. Until midnight at least, when
it all wears off with no hangover!
This year's Rag M a g has arrived
but will not be on sale until the Beer
Festival on Wednesday. There will,
however, be a few on sale in the bar
every night beforehand for at least
£2 (usual price 50p).
A n d at last we have the Rag
W e e k T-shirts. They are on sale
now for £6 (which is cheap
compared to the £10 you might pay
normally). They are available from
Rag Officers, Hall Reps and from
the U n i o n Office.
Mascotry
I M P O R T A N T - The official fresh
start to Mascotry is happening today
with the handing back of Spanner
and Bolt to City and Guilds. This
is happening at l p m today on the
Queen's L a w n .
C&G Slave Auction
W h e n : Tuesday 19th N o v
Where: M e c h E n g 220
T i m e : 12.30pm onwards
O n Tuesday lunchtime it's the City
& Guilds' annual slave auction. If
you haven't signed up yet and you
want to, do it quick. Slave auctions
are always a good laugh (especially
if you're participating). The general
idea is that people are sold as slaves
(all money going to Rag of course)
to people or groups that then have
the services of that person for a day.
Don't Panic. There are rules as
to what a slave can and cannot do.
However the best rule as far as
slaves are concerned is that they
must be fed and watered for the
day, good huh!
If you don't fancy being a slave,
then go along and buy one. They're
always good for tidying the odd
room, or two and taking lecture
notes. If you think that you may not
be able to afford a slave on your
own, then form a consortium.
Loads of people do every year and
more money goes to charity that
way.
Babble Cards
Included in this Rag Week Pull-Out
section is a Babble C a r d for you to
cut out and use.
For those of you who have not yet
come across these before, a Babble
Card is given to someone who talks
unnecessarily for a great length of
time on a topic of no interest or
relevance to anything in particular.
So, if you happen to be on the
receiving end of such mindless
waffle, then whip out your Babble
Card, thrust it in their direction and
hopefully they'll get the message.
If you happen to receive a Babble
C a r d , then you are free to pass it
on to someone else who begins to
babble. B y putting your name or
initials on the back of the card
before passing it on, you can see
how many people have been given
the card before you, or how long
it has taken for your own card to
return to you.
Please make use of the Babble
Card and help to eliminate senseless
drivel at IC.
YES, IT'S THE PIT'S
-IT'S BULL..IT'S..
TOTAL ROTT
THIS IS VERY
OFFENSIVE.
Killer Extended
Officially the deadline for signing
up for Killer was Wednesday.
Although we have had a great
response so far, it has been brought
to my attention that there are still
a large n u m b e r w i s h i n g to
participate who have, as yet, been
unable to sign up. A s Killer only
comes round once a year it was felt
that it would be unfair not to give
as many keen and eager assassins
as we could the chance of their first
kill. If Y O U fall into this category,
having not yet signed up, you will
be pleased to hear that we have
extended the deadline to T H I S
F R I D A Y . Today is your L A S T
chance. Sign up after the R A G
meeting or at the U n i o n office
during the day (it shuts 5.30). It's
only £2.50 & two photo's o f
yourself.
For those of you who have
already signed up, the official
starting time will now be 24.00 on
M o n d a y night. Y o u w i l l be
informed or where to collect your
target from. W e apologise for the
delay if your fingers are already
itchy, but the more people involved
the more frantic it gets. H a ha ha.
