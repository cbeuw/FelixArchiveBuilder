Quincy Jones Monster in a Box
Quincy Jones is an influential name
in the music business. I knew that,
but it is difficult to imagine one man
having quite such a profound effect
on so many people's lives.
When talking about someone who
started off playing trumpet behind
Billie Holiday, arranged music for
Count Basie and went on to produce
Michael Jackson's Thriller album,
it becomes clear that Quincy Jones
is a very big name in the history of
American jazz and popular music.
W e also get a glimpse of the
background of this successful black
American as he wanders through
the Seattle neighbourhood where he
once lived and recounts vague
memories of his mother who was
mentally ill. Looking at some of this
footage it is quite difficult to see
how someone could emerge from
s u c h p o v e r t y to b e c o m e an
international star.
Quincy Jones' creativity has
spanned almost four decades from
its beginnings with his close friend
R a y C h a r l e s , through to his
associations with jazz greats such as
Count Basie, Charlie ' B i r d ' Parker,
Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis, all
of whom are chronicled in this film
with i n t e r v i e w s and a r c h i v e
footage. W e are brought up to date
with clips of Michael Jackson and
W h i t n e y H o u s t o n along with
interviews with Melle M e l and
other contemporary musicians. The
amount of material within this film
is quite phenomenal, it's all laced
together well and never becomes
confusing.
Y o u don't have to be a jazz fan
to enjoy this film, it's a portrait of
a man who has had a very big
influence on American musical
entertainment in many forms.
One small criticism I would have
is that there's too many small
snatches of the music and it would
have been nice to hear a good blast
of each song, but then again, with
over sixty pieces featured, it would
have taken all night.

A W o m a n Destroyed
Firstly, I must apologise for
submitting this review so late; it's
a cock-up entirely on my part. I
grossly underestimated how long A
Woman Destroyed was running for.
This means that tomorrow's show
(9th November) is the last one.
Sorry.
T h e play is running for the short
period of just three weeks, not, I
may add, for want of punters and
critical acclaim. Indeed, applause
from some journalistic quarters has
been quite deafening. A n d that, I
feel, is what this play is about: a
tour de force - a very high brow,
critical exercise rather than a
performance that foremost claims to
entertain.
Muriel is alone and lonely during
the Parisian winter festivities,
deserted by husband and offspring.
Driven by frustration, she bears her
guilt-ridden soul to the audience in
a one and a half hour monologue
which lacks a little structure. Diane
Quick, sole actress and translator of
Simone de Beauvoirs play, strides
around the stage in a beautifully
wretched manner which, by its
conclusion, can't help but to
depress. T h e play D O E S have a
little humour such as the line: " M y
d o c t o r s p r e s c r i b e d me
tranquilisers.... the man's a sadist!
these are suppositories!" which
raised a chuckle but otherwise, so
devoid of humour, so bleak, y o u ' l l
leave the auditorium thoughtful if
not melancholy.
If you feel like a piece of deep,
thought provoking stuff then you'll
enjoy this, though I think it'll appeal
more to females than males. I found
it intriguing... but not compelling.
A Woman Destroyed is showing
at the Hammersmith Lyric until the
9th of November.
S W C T G P (Somebody W h o
C o u l d n ' t T h i n k of a G o o d
Pseudonym)
Monster in a Box is the latest in
S p a l d i n g G r a y ' s h i l a r i o u s
autobiography monologues and
roughly picks up where G r a y ' s
Swimming to Cambodia left off.
In the film Gray tells of all the
interruptions he created, discovered
and experienced in order to avoid
writing his enormous (1,900 page)
autobiographical novel—it being the
Monster of the title.
The interruptions Gray describes
include a trip to the Soviet U n i o n
in the c o m p a n y o f s e v e r a l
Hollywood stars for a Soviet film
festival, a residency in Los Angeles
funded by 'a grant to find people in
L A not involved in the film
industry' (LA—The Other), a trip
to Nicaragua, and his catastropic
experiences as the lead in Thornton
Wilder's Our Town on Broadway.
Wherever Gray goes mayhem
and turmoil is certain to follow. The
director Nick Broomfield (whose
w o r k i n c l u d e s the h i l a r i o u s
documentary for Channel Four,
The Leader, His Driver, the
Driver's Wife. Laurie Anderson's
music and G r a y ' s script and
p e r f o r m a n c e create a self-
deprecating, ironic New Y o r k voice
which is quite distinct from, say,
W o o d y Allen's. W e enter G r a y ' s
consciousness and discover the
business that comes from too much
possibility and relish G r a y ' s
unequal struggle to maintain some
sort of balance whilst his inner
demons work their way through his
system.
