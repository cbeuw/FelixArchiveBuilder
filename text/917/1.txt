Security Privatisation
College security staff are to be
replaced by private contractors,
according to G o r d o n Marshall,
Director of College Estates. In a
letter to all security, messenger and
traffic staff on the South Kensington
campus, he said that due to a 'need
to modernise systems' the College
was proposing to 'contract out the
whole of this area of operations'.
In a meeting of all affected staff
last M o n d a y , D e r e k D o l l a r d ,
President of the Manufacturing,
Science and Finance Trade U n i o n
( M S F ) , said that he believed that
costs would not in fact be cut, but
college would be 'wasting it
somewhere else'. H e added that
'nobody will get anything out of this
except outside contractors'. H e
called for the unions to 'shut down
this place on the day of the
G o v e r n i n g B o d y m e e t i n g (4
December) subject to the
result of a ballot, of course.' T h i s
ballot is due to be taken on
Wednesday.
In his letter, G o r d o n Marshall
stated that a period of one month's
consultation was left open to talk
with the unions. Steven Newbold,
Director of Marketing, inferred that
withdrawal of the proposal was
unlikely, stating that the proposal
'would not have been brought
forward at an immature stage'. The
staff under threat have been given
the hope that they can be redeployed
'within the college, or elsewhere in
the University of L o n d o n ' . If this
is not possible then the staff will
have to take voluntary redundancy,
or have compulsory redundancy
forced upon them.
Sue Sharp, secretary of I C M S F ,
told Felix that although the matter
was 'under negotiation, it didn't
look hopeful.' She added that a
petition is to be posted at messenger
desks and will be passed on to the
Rector, Sir Eric A s h , when enough
signatures are amassed.
T h e Fire Brigade were called out
last Friday to the Mechanical
Engineering building when the
departmental superintendent, Colin
Rogers, attempted to clear the
building by setting off the fire
alarm.
M r Rogers explained that he had
been given the job o f manning the
m e s s e n g e r s desk whilst the
messengers and security were at the
Trade U n i o n meeting. W h e n the
building had to be cleared at 5.30
prior to being locked for the
weekend, the fire alarm was set off.
The authorities in Sherfield had not
been notified that there was no fire,
so the Brigade were called.
M r Rogers told Felix that 'he did
not think anything when he saw the
fire engines, since fire engines are
continually driving up and down
Exhibition Road' and added that on
r e f l e c t i o n he was ' a c u t e l y
embarrassed' and 'would do it
better next time.' A spokesman for
the fire brigade said that they must
treat every call as if it were a real
fire and that they only hoped that
when called to these incidences they
were not being called away from
real incidences which threatened
lives.
