I received a number o f features after
the deadline this week, including
the next gripping chapter o f ' T h e
Inner System'. They will go in next
week. Please try to keep to the
deadline o f 12.30 Monday.
The Union Onion
Steve Newhouse's article on the
structure o f the U n i o n o n the page
facing started its tiny life as a space
filler because when I did the page
allocation on Monday there was a
large hole left over. It has turned
out to be a very interesting exercise
in management structure - the
U n i o n cannot be drawn in two
dimensions; the minimum required
is at least six. O n e o f the main
sticking points are the Constituent
College Unions ( C C U s ) which are
smaller versions o f the main Student
U n i o n , a n d are f i n a n c i a l l y
subservient to it. The conundrum is
exemplified by the position o f St
M a r y ' s College U n i o n which was
described at the last C o u n c i l
meeting as an 'independent and
autonomous C C U ' . Independent,
autonomous and constituent? There
is c o n s i d e r a b l e s c o p e f o r
improvement in efficiency in Union
structure; there appears to be a large
amount o f repetition o f services and
much difficulty on the part o f the
student as to who they should
approach for what service. I
honestly don't know the answer and
I am not trying to victimise any or
all o f the C C U s , it just seems rather
bizarre.
Security G u a r d s
It has to be said that the College
authorities are, once again, playing
their card in a high handed manner.
Virtually the entirety o f College
messengers and security have been
told that their services will not be
needed as o f next February to make
way for private contractors. I
attended the Trade U n i o n meeting
last M o n d a y , attended by many
such messengers, which seemed to
be heavily steamrollered by Derek
D o l l a r d , p r e s i d e n t o f the
M a n u f a c t u r i n g , S c i e n c e a n d
Finance Trade U n i o n . H e seemed
intent on convincing those attending
that a strike was inevitable and
desirable. O n e o f those attending
said rather bitterly that the Student
U n i o n had done nothing to help
them, whilst looking at me. This
makes me cross. Firstly, I a m not
a representative o f the Student
U n i o n , I am the editor o f the
Student U n i o n newspaper, and
secondly it is not the job o f the
Student U n i o n to protect the
messengers unless it is obvious that
such action will adversely affect
students. It is not obvious.
Strange Letters
Occasionally we receive unsolicited
mail at the Felix office. This week
we got a leaflet purporting to be a
d o c u m e n t f r o m the A U T
( A s s o c i a t i o n o f U n i v e r s i t y
Teachers) containing some rather

researching the story, all parties
concerned claimed they had no idea
what it was about. This leads to One
o f the following conclusions:
Everybody is trying to cover up; the
source o f the leaflet was trying to
mislead us; or we didn't research
enough. The former seems unlikely
as the story wasn't really that
important; the second is quite
possible and so is the third. If the
source o f the letter could please
make contact with me (8672) to
confirm its veracity I would most
appreciate it. Y o u don't have to
give any identification, so I won't
reveal who y o u are.
Thefts in Bad Taste
F e l i x ' M u s i c ' E d i t o r a n d
Masterpiece of Gothic Architecture,
D a v i d Spooner, has been suffering
serious mental aberrations this
week. H e has been wailing ' m y
babies, my babies' whilst tearing at
his rather visible hair roots. T h e
reason? Somebody has nicked his
collection o f records from m y
office. If you value the content o f
your Felix, please return them to
me and I will humanely destroy
them to the benefit o f all humanity.
Leaving aside m y opinions as to
David's musical taste ('The Misters
of Surtsey', 'The Tramps' and 'The
Trains'), theft is theft and is not
acceptable. Please return them.

A t the time o f writing £42 worth o f

guarantee I will eat the hat - maybe
over a week - if I receive a cartoon
by the deadline. C o m e into the Felix
office and put your name down for
a pound or two, and if the Chapeau-
mangant event doesn't come to pass
because the cartoon did not appear,
you will not have to cough up.
