Guilds Carniva
Tonight is Guilds' Rag Carnival!
Miss this at your peril!
For a mere £5.50 you can enjoy
an amazing seven hours of fun,
frolics and fornication (as long as
it's discrete and unavoidable - see
Steve Farrant for details). Here's
what'll be in store for you. (So
come along and enjoy yourselves
while doing a good deed for Rag.)
Rock ' n ' Roll with the Wild Angels,
get down and boogie with the
Brothers G r i m m - look out Jake &
Elwood. Then, after gambling your
life away in Capone's Casino, you
can finish off the evening in Bonnie
& C l y d e ' s Bop.
T h i s ' l l be the best £5.50 you'll
ever spend, so be there and bring
your friends. Get your tickets today
from either the Guilds' office or the
I C U office. (Tickets guarantee
entry, but you can pay on the door.)
See you there!
N . B . A l l users of the U n i o n
building, including the U n i o n bar,
will be asked to leave the building
by 7.30pm ready for the Carnival.
The union bar will be open to
Carnival goers O N L Y .
Poppy Craw
Last Saturday saw both a Poppy
Day Collection and a Pub C r a w l ,
both of which were great successes.
The Poppy D a y Collection took
place in Maidstone, Kent, with 12
rag people setting off before 9am
and braving the cold for 3 hours.
The amount of money raised will
not be known until December, as
the charity themselves are counting
it all.
The Pub Crawl was in aid of the
Leukaemia Research Fund, and
involved students from all over the
country. Oxford University sent
down about 300 people and there
was even a team from Plymouth
Polytechnic (it took them 7 hours
to get here).
IC Rag went round as three teams
and c o v e r e d about 30 pubs
collecting money and selling old
Rag Mags as they went. Again, the
totals are not yet known as
Leukaemia are counting the money
themselves.
Don't forget the Sponsored City
O f London Pub Crawl next Friday. The Brothers Grimm. Not a Fairy Tale.
