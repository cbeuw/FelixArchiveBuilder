G r o w u p a l i t t l e
Dear Adam,
Again we see apathy mentioned
with respect to IC students both in
the realm of issues that affect
students (Poll Tax, (see you all in
court on the 21st), student loans and
all the other ridiculously unfair and
stupid educational reforms brought
in by the present government) and
in connection with college and
Union activities.
The first issue is most c r u c i a l —
not enough students make not
difficult circumstances. This could
be due to the existence o f
sabbaticals and a more committed
breed of students being involved on
the organisational side (for instance
the O S C , with whom I have
contact, being the secretary of I C
JapanSoc).
In short, although not perfect,
I C U does O K .
Let's look at the C C U s , or more
specifically R C S U as that is the one
I've been a member of for five
enough fuss about the slings and
arrows hurled at them from on high
that make living as a student in
London as opposed to simply
surviving, damn nigh impossible.
This is very, very sad (unless of
course you happen to agree with the
government, can't imagine why).
Secondly, Union matters. This
can be conveniently divided into
t w o - I C U and the C C U s . I C U , I
believe, although still slightly
infected with the disease that
deludes the sufferer into believing
that everybody needs them and that
they are more important than they
really are, does basically a good job
in terms of events, the Union Bar
and the like. They work well under
years (can the others be much
different?). I'm prompted to write
mostly as a result of reading the
article on M a s c o t r y in both
Broadsheet and Felix. This seems
to typify the C C U s . Mascotry, for
heaven's sake why? L i k e most of
the things connected with C C U s it
strikes me as a complete waste of
time, trying to steal little bits of
metal during missions planned to
alleviate the severe sexual
frustration no doubt felt by these
s a d ' i m m a t u r e cases. If the
mascoteers applied themselves to
their respective degrees with the
same level of enthusiasm as they do
to mascotry then the intellectual
status of the college might just rise
a little. G r o w up a little.
R C S U is no better. S i l l y ,
immature little people who still
think farts are funny, swapping
stories about how drunk they can
get and no doubt lying (for
information I fall over after two
pints of weak lager). If anyone is
sad enough to want into this little
clique, they should be prepared on
the whole to fail their degree
(usually Physics) (I open this second
bracket to remind people that
degrees are after all what the loose
o r g a n i s a t i o n p o s i n g as the
Government pay most of us to get),
sing a ridiculous tribal tune (to my
shame I do know the words) and get
into SciFi as an excuse to face
reality. Anyone who doesn't believe
me should read Broadsheet (making
two of us) and sample that rapier
wit of the contributers. It's pathetic,
it's cliquey and in case they didn't
know it C C U hacks are normally
regarded as figures of ridicule or
wankers, or both. When are you
going to learn, apart from the hacks
t h e m s e l v e s , for w h o m the
organisations really exist to
serve—Nobody gives a s**t about
the R C S U (and I suspect, the other
two). I don't know how much the
C C U s receive from the Union per
student, but I'd prefer my share
cash in hand right now—backdated
until 1987 if it's all the same to you
as I have seen no benefit
whatsoever.
A s for the hacks, it's not too late,
realising and admitting that you
have got a problem is half of the
battle as they say. What is the point
in trying to perpetuate the worn out
old myth that IC has got college
spirit when you know that that's a
load of crap. I've seen more spirit
at the annual c o n v e n t i o n o f
Alcoholics Anonymous—let's all be
honest. Before you all say 'but with
twats around like you, there never
will be a college spirit' I really don't
give a s**t, we all find our own way
(as Confucius said).
Whatever we do, let's stop the
pretence that C C U s have a vital role
to play that the word ' C C U hack'
is anything more than a term of
d i s p a r a g e m e n t . A b o l i s h the
mascots, abolish the C C U s and let
the associated clubs make out on
their own. O h by the way, mine's
a bottle of 1080, anyone here read
the new A s i m o v novel? Kangela
armadola, kangela armadola... come
on everyone you know the words...

Dear Adam.
I am writing to you to protest
against the participation in a
meeting of the ' A n t i W a r in the
G u l f Society held on Thursday
27th November, by a representative
o f the Palestine L i b e r a t i o n
Organisation. Even though I believe
that the Palestinians certainly have
a right to voice their opinion,
especially in these recent times of
peace conferences, I feel personally
threatened by having a member of
an active terrorist organisation to
represent them. The person in
question was announced as having
spent ten years in an Israeli prison
and one certainly doesn't receive a
sentence like that for driving
through a red light.
Until the P L O give up their
ongoing terrorist activities, I feel
they have no right to a free platform
in a place like this, especially in a
supposedly apolitical college. Only
a couple of weeks ago, an Israeli
bus was attacked and a mother of
seven children was among those
killed. T h e P L O have failed to
renounce their covenant which
states their aims of the destruction
of the Jewish State and claims that
every Jew is a legitimate target for
their terrorist activities. I am sure
that you would agree with me in
having meetings like this prevented
in the future.
Yours faithfully.
