What About Bob? Editorial
W o w ! Bill Murray. Not so oooh,
wow, gosh (but more like he's
getting on a bit), Richard Dreyfuss!
This is a comedy—what's that I
hear you say: Richard Dreyfuss?
Comedy? Naaah! Well if Arnie can
do it so can anybody (well o.k. let's
leave I C S F members out of this).
Yes this is a comedy, and one of the
better ones around at the moment.
Multi phobic Bob Wiley (Bill
Murray) is a very nutty guy; even
his phobias have ' phobias. T o
overcome his problems he enlists
the help of D r L e o M a r v i n (Rich).
D r M a r v i n is a highly respected,
egotistical, fame loving psychiatrist.
However he's going on holiday
with the fam and Bob wants h e l p -
badly. So Bob and his pet fish G i l
cleverly ferret out the M a r v i n s '
p r i v a t e v a c a t i o n h i d e a w a y .
Tracking Leo down, Bob innocently
insinuates himself into the lives of
the M a r v i n family, who all come to
adore the guest who won't l e a v e -
all except Leo, who is taking a
leisurely stroll into the twiglet zone.
Unable to regain control of his life
L e o hits upon a plan to get rid of
Bob, a development that leaves
everyone wondering who's crazy
and who isn't.
Bob is brilliant—he seems to
think that everything L e o does to
get rid of him is some sort of
revolutionary new therapy—even
death therapy!! This film was very
well thought out, the laughs aren't
squashed into ten minutes of the
film, and most of them are (for
once) funny. B i l l M u r r a y is
City Slickers
City Slickers is the latest comedy
with Billy Crystal, the guy from
WTien Harry Met Sally, playing the
part of M i t c h , a man who has just
turned thirty-nine, is stuck in a
boring job, and is thoroughly fed up
with his lot in life. (Actually he's
playing the same wise-cracking
character he played in WHMS, but
he's still very funny, so who
cares?). W h e n his friends, Phil and
E d , come up with the idea of going
on an all-American cattle-drive to
raise his spirits, Mitch's wife insists
he goes in order, as she put it, to
find his smile.
A l o n g the trail, the three friends
learn they didn't know as much
about each other as they thought;
Phil has been cheating on his wife,
with the checkout-girl at the
supermarket he runs, and hotpants
E d is in emotional turmoil about
having children with his young new
wife, afraid of the level of
commitment. Through hardship
they become much closer, as they
slog through the harsh reality of
c o w b o y life, h e r d i n g cattle,
delivering calves, and trying not to
get killed by the leader of a group,
the m e n a c i n g C u r l y , p l a y e d
brilliantly by Jack 'Snub Nose'
Palace.
City Slickers is a wonderful
movie, and was deservedly a huge
hit at the American box-office,
taking in more than $110 million.
Crystal is in hilarious form, and he
is well supported by Daniel Stern
and Bruno K i r b y , playing his
friends, and Patricia Wetting as his
long-suffering wife. M a n y of the
scenes, however are stolen by
N o r m a , the wide-eyed calf whom
M i t c h deiivers. T h e appearance of
N o r m a n onscreen seldom failed to
raise an 'aaar' from the audience.
This film has everything—comedy,
action, heartache, and bullshit
(literally). It's a simple tale told
very well, and I throroughly
recommend it.
R o n n i e C .
excellent, showing everyone how
truly versatile he is. In fact the only
really annoying bit of the film is
whenever L e o ' s wife Fay (played
by Julie Hagerty of Airplane fame)
opens her oversweet mouth, you
just want to use some death therapy
on her.
O n the whole then, well worth a
few quid. Y o u won't be sorry you
saw this film. What About Bob?
Yes (now where's that therapy
book).
Poo.
W e are pleased to bring you, for
one week only, the fabulous Quincy
Jones! Yes, this week sees the
publication of the legendary Life
And Loves of Quincy Jones by our
very own Rose Atkins, coinciding
with the first anniversary of the
press screening. Concise, to the
point and charmingly written, this
splendid work has only matured
over the twelve months since its
creation. Read it and weep.
Okay, now a bit of shop talk.
C a t h e r i n e D a r w e n , R o n n i e C ,
where are you? F o r that matter,
who are you? W e ' r e always in the
F e l i x office on W e d n e s d a y
afternoons.
F i n a l l y , thanks v e r y m u c h
whoever absconded with the L F F
ticket instructions. Y o u fucked
everything up completely. Cheers.
