All the President's Motions
U G M — U n i o n G e n e r a l M e e t i n g
This was on Thursday and 23
people turned up! Does anyone care
what the U n i o n is doing for them?
I could be doing anything with the
Union funds such as squandering
them on B C C I shares and a holiday
in Acapulco and you wouldn't know
anything about it because you
weren't there.
The main aim at the U G M is to
decide Union policy i.e. its stance
on all the issues which affect
students at Imperial. A sabbatical's
main job is to represent students'
views but we can't do that without
knowing the Union's stance and it
can't have one unless you, the
students, make your views felt.
Currently we have to trust our own
judgement on issues but who knows
if that is the correct one? W e believe
it is but do you? F o r example, this
U G M we were meant to be
discussing the lengthening of the
College Day but we couldn't. T h e
Union could currently be bargaining
for the wrong thing where it comes
to this issue but we don't know.
Due to low numbers the U G M
was closed early, there's going to
be an E x t r a o r d i n a r y G e n e r a l
Meeting ( E G M ) in two weeks time
which will be publicised. I hope
more people turn up as it is for
you—every single IC student that
we're doing it.
W o m e n ' s W e i g h t T r a i n i n g
Does anyone have any views on the
desirability of the women only
session in the weights g y m in the
Sports Centre. Unless there is a
strong feeling in favour then they
will be stopped. C a n you phone
3501. come in or send me a note if
you have any thoughts on this.
T h a n k s
Finally, thanks must go to the
student who wrecked the U n i o n
photocopier this week by putting the
wrong transparencies in it. If he/she
had told us rather than disappearing
then the machine would have been
f i x e d s o o n e r with less
inconvenience caused.

C a l l for M o t i o n s
There is an Extraordinary General
M e e t i n g on T h u r s d a y 28th
November. T h e main aim of this is
to make (and break) U n i o n policy
on any issue that affects you. F o r
instance if the current state of
Southside Bar concerns you then
you could propose a motion forcing
the sabbaticals to campaign for
better premises. Motions can also
force a Union stance on issues such
'as"the Ayatollah's statement about
Salman Rushdie. A s you can see
absolutely anything can be proposed
at a E G M whether it is passed or
not is another matter.
T h e next step after submitting
your motion is turning up to the
General Meeting where it will be
discussed. The Chairman will call
the proposer to speak for the motion
and then for objections from the
floor. Discussion will ensue from
there, hopefully ending in a vote.
If the vote is in favour then the
motion will be passed as U n i o n
policy.
If y o u ' d like to submit a motion
or feel strongly about something
and would .like someone else to
submit a motion on it then please
come and see Zoe Hellinger (Union
President), Steve Farrant (Hon Sec
(Events)) or Joe Fernley ( U G M
Chair) and we'll help you format
the motion and give advice on how
to get it through the E G M .
D o n ' t forget motions to be
submitted by 5.30pm, Tuesday 19
November.
A Great Event
A s another week has flown by and
you're presently wondering why
Friday morning lectures always
look like Felix reading marathons
you'll be glad to know that Rag
Week is upon us. Penguin will have
given details elsewhere but do go
to the events.
G u i l d s C a r n i v a l (Tonight)
T h e U n i o n bar will only be open to
people attending the carnival so
don't turn up at Beit Quad just for
the bar. Please bring your U n i o n
card if you do wnat to come in.
Publicity
There will be a review of publicity
space allocations at the end of the
month. So make sure that your club
or society is using their allocated
space properly.
See you at the Beer Festival.
