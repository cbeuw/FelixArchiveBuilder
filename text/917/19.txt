Clayponds makes an Impression
T h e final stage of the Clayponds
estate is to be sold to Imperial
College Residences P L C (Impress)
when building has been completed
in about two weeks. Impress is a
'Business E x p a n s i o n S c h e m e '
(BES) company, and will pay
College about £2.9 million for the
remainder of the estate.
M r M a l c o l m A l d r i d g e ,
C o n t r o l l e r o f I C ' s F i n a n c i a l
Services, told Felix that B E S was
i n v e n t e d in 1983 by the
Government to encourage small
businesses by giving tax incentives.
Investors in the company are
virtually guaranteed a dividend,
though they must invest for a
minimum of five years. Investors
bought shares at £1 each, to a total
of £4.5 million, and these will be
bought back for £1.45 at the end of
the five years. 'Impress' are to use
T h e Rector, Sir Eric A s h , plans to
guarantee College accomodation to
all female I C students for the
entirety of their course and to all
first year students, even when they
live in London. These points were
made in a letter sent to all
Departmental heads this week. It
comes in the same week in which
figures w e r e released by
polytechnics which show that they
have a far greater number of
students and thus a larger
proportion of public money than
Universities.
T h e offer of accomodation made
in the letter ended with the comment
that 'it is acceptable to make both
offers to all prospective first years'.
T h e issue has been discussed by the
Applications Policy Group ( A P G )
Felix has received a copy of a report
claiming that the Management
School has been abusing the
regulations for staff entering the
school. Until last year all staff of
the University of L o n d o n and their
children were entitled to attend the
M B A Management Course free of
charge. T h i s resulted in the
oversubscription by staff and the
s c h o o l l o s i n g m o n e y . T h e
M a n a g e m e n t P l a n n i n g G r o u p
( M P G ) stopped this entitlement in
January of this year.
T h e document claims that the
head of the Management School,
Professor D Norburn, changed
these rules over the summer and so
their money buying property from
the College, and they will receive
the investment plus interest back
from College at the end of five
years. In effect, the College is
getting a cheap loan for the interim
years w h i c h will reduce the
residence budget deficit.
'Impress' is authorised to invest
only in lettings o f residential
a c c o m m o d a t i o n and assured
tenancies. Clayponds is an assured
tenancy, which involves a contract
signed by both parties and the
option of changing the rent to fit the
current market. Students living at
Clayponds do not have the option
of going to an independent rent
tribunal, as many assured tenancy
holders do. The rent is decided by
the Rector on the advice of the
C o l l e g e ' s Residence A d v i s o r y
Committee. M r Aldridge told Felix
who oversee College intake, who
have rejected the offer of having
women in halls for all the time they
are in college. M r David Atkins of
the Applications Office said 'we
should not offer accomodation we
do not have.'
L o r e t t o O ' C a l l a g h a n , I C
Accomodation Officer, said that the
proposals sounded 'like an excellent
recruitment drive' and that a large
number of women on campus
should be encouraged from a 'safety
point of view.'. W h e n asked about
the chance of accomodation being
over-subscribed she replied that the
scheme 'could work if deadlines for
accomodations were strictly kept
t o . ' Z o e H e l l i n g e r , U n i o n
President, attended the A P C and
told Felix afterwards that the
allowed his son to enter without
paying any fees. When asked about
the changes, Professor Norburn
said the situation was 'under
negotiation' and when questioned
about any c h i l d r e n o f the
management entering the school
this year he replied 'no comment.'
Tony Cullen, College Admissions
Director, said 'no one should be
getting a free course out of the
Management School, if they are I
want to know about it.' T h e IC
Association of University Teachers
who apparently produced the
report, were unavailable for
comment.
that this was 'not because we want
to be oppressive landlords - or the
B E S come to that,' but because
rents in all C o l l e g e o w n e d
residences should be decided
consistently.
A c c o r d i n g to M r A l d r i d g e ,
residents of Clayponds, who have
to sign a five year rental agreement,
have a right to terminate their
contracts early, but no reciprocal
arrangement exists for the College.
This means that if a student finishes
their study before the end of their
rental agreement they do not have
to move out of the accomodation at
that point. M r Aldridge added that
the B E S 'doesn't really benefit
students living in residences at all
in terms of rents and such - only
benefits on wide and long term view
.... what's good for C o l l e g e
residence account is good for
proposals were generaly rejected.
She added that the idea of female
accomodation for the entire length
of their course was 'sexist' and
'taking positive discrimination too
far.'
T h e college has also asked
department heads to keep in contact
with prospective students as they
approach the time when they enter
c o l l e g e . T h e R e c t o r also
commented in his letter that with the
London allowance, IC students
were in a financially 'neutral'
position when higher rents were
taken into account.
O n Thursday the Rector will be
answering questions in Huxley 213
at 5.30pm. Questions can be
submitted to Zoe Hellinger, U n i o n
President, beforehand.
Poison
Pen
A chain letter has been received by
some students in the Mechanical
Engineering Department. The letter
is headed 'With love all things are
possible' and is typed. It is signed
by 'St Jude' and contains promises
of wealth and 'good luck' if the
letter is continued and threats of
personal danger and death if the
chain is broken.
Jonathan Griffiths, Union Deputy
President, said 'this letter is
insulting to the intelligence, if it
weren't so hard I'd use it as
A n d r e x . '
students.'
So far 14 flats in Clayponds
belong to 'Impress', and 6-7
students have signed the contract.
W h e n the remainder of the estate is
completed, this will also be sold to
' I m p r e s s ' . O r i g i n a l l y it was
intended that an alternative part of
the estate was to be sold, but it was
realised in August that by the time
the money would be raised, the
relevant bit of the estate would have
been occupied - and so, under the
rules of the B E S , could not be
bought by 'Impress'. B y the time
the deal is completed 3 0 % of
Clayponds will belong to 'Impress'
and 7 0 % to the College. This will
not make any difference in the rents
or payment methods, said M r
Aldridge, and the estate will be
managed as a whole by the College.
Closed
The College libraries closed early
last F r i d a y because o f the
withdrawal of labour by security
staff. Usually at that time there are
only three librarians working in the
building and an employee of the
library said 'that the three librarians
could not be expected to work in the
building with no security'.
