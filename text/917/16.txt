Never heard o f 'em. Nice cover,
kind o f elegant, textured images
c o n t r i b u t e to a b r o n z e — y ,
b u r n i s h e d effect; dead cute.
Nothing familiar in the credits. The
fold-out cover is littered with
pseudo-obscure phraseology (get
'Promises trade but you don't get
them back', o r ' Y o u don't mix
blood and milk in my town'). Very
R.E.M. circa 'Reckoning'/ 'Life's
Rich Pageant'. A n d onto the music.
D o you know, I might be in for a
surprise here.
'Pretty in Print' opens this
thirteen-track a l b u m , quite a
charming Tom Petty/Byrds/R.E.M.
singalong. That guitar sound, those
vocals - err, it's undeniably amiable
listening, but if one was to take this
as the standard bearer it would seem
The Gutter Bros
- L i v e at T & C 2
A m a z i n g is the best word I can
come up with to describe my latest
venture into the world o f L o n d o n
gigs, The Gutter Brothers, a jolly
bunch o f skiffle punksters. T w o
hours of one of the best live bands
around, this was a show worth
seeing. Starting off their set with
Stand up, Little Jesus, they led us
through most o f their repertoire,
from old faves like Fat Cadillac,
Where do they keep the water?, Still
waiting and Live and Learn to
newer material like The Spoiler,
Mr. Nasty and the excellent Queen
of Cardboard City. W e were totally
absorbed by the whole energy of the
band, hit b y vibe after vibe o f
wholesome goodness, right up to
the inevitable encore, Kiss, the most
spectacular cover of this old classic
you're ever likely to hear. For those
who don't know, The Gutter
Brothers can often be seen busking
in Covent Garden, they've done the
entire s o u n d t r a c k f o r H a r r y
Enfield's new T . V . series Gone to
the Dogs, and you can see them
next at the Borderline, November
23rd. B e there!
F.O.B.
like Stipe and the boys missing
album. With the onset o f the
following tracks, that idea is
dismissed. Sadly, the album starts
to degenerate into some swollen
c o c k - r o c k affair, four b o y s
altogether in a closet, and it's
getting sweaty in there. Phew!
Puerile, too. Side two opens with
'Dammit to Hell', two minutes o f
frozen funk-rock that ain't exactly
the loveliest mine ears hath ever
heard, in fact, jerky, electrified shit
that's been done better a thousand
times before without a virtuoso
guitar solo. It's one o f their best
tracks. 'Four Fuses' is, quite
possibly, better, but, well, do they
cascade, transcend their influences,
take p o p o n a brightly-coloured
rollercoaster ride, hubris a n d
nemesis for the fey, faceless
nonentities falsely p r o c l a i m e d
Messiahs? A r e they, i n short,
Country & Western? A r e they f**k.
P.S. W i l l Y o u marry me, Lise?

Natural Life
— Strange World
A s if to imply that there is a form
of life that is unnatural, Natural Life
rear their dread-heads to a radio-
friendly slice of dance-rock in order
to tell us that they're not terribly
chuffed with the day's play Terra
side. This is a strange world? N a h ,
a strange world is paradise, that
terribly nice place which is the
b y e w o r d f o r h a r m o n i o u s c o -
existence. N o t dear o l d Earth,
where the lowest of the low are the
downtrodden music hacks whose
hair is falling out with every new
realisation o f the pointlessness o f
their existence. Nevertheless,
Strange World is quite good, a
charged vocal delivering heartfelt
sentiments, tirading against the
awfulness of human beings and our
absurd selfishness, and for that, I
wish them well.
T h e B-side is much more m y
t h i n g ; bare a n d desolate
arrangements pervade over a dance
beat so crisp y o u ' d think it was
played on wafers. O r tin cans. O r
something like that. Christ! is that
the time? T h e G r i m Reaper was
expecting me hours ago. 'Bye.

Intastella
— Century
This woman has the sort o f voice
that can seduce at a hundred yards.
The guitar sound is similar to many
other dreamy, melting groups
around at the moment with the
difference that you can still hear her
voice.
They have a wonderful ability to
write melodies that trip along
without a trouble in the world.
E v e r y track is a five minute
masterpiece, perfectly crafted and
polished. Perhaps a little too
polished. Some feeling seems to
have been lost, there is a feeling that
live all you would get is perfect
rendition o f this.
Tracks like Paris are a witch's
brew o f sounds, blended together
like some primeval soup that

yearning for more.
Its nice to hear some decent tunes
for a change, there has been too
much o f this 'noise' stuff for me.
Buy this record and it's melt city.
