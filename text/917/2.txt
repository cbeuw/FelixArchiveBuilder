Two thousand meals thrown away
Dear Adam,
Thank y o u for featuring the
report on Linstead H a l l meals, in
issue 915. I am writing on behalf
of the residents o f Linstead Hall, in
order to explain the situation more
fully.
Although Linstead Hall provides
five evening meals a week, it has
always been possible for residents
to sign out, and receive a rebate for
up to two meals a week. However,
during the summer vacation it was
decided that the rebate system
would be scrapped, and residents
would be charged for five evening
Dear Adam,
In your reply to Professor
Swanson's letter about the College
Day, y o u asked whether the Trade
Unions had been consulted.
Y o u may be interested to know
that we were asked for our
comments by the Personnel Office
at the end o f M a y , and given a
month in which to reply.
During this period we sent a
questionnaire to all our members,
who include administrative, library
and computing staff as well as
lecturers, asking for their views on
the likely effects o f extended
working hours o n their travelling,
childcare, research and other
activities.
A s very little enthusiasm for the
Tuppence
Dear Adam,
I feel I must write to you on the
very strongest terms.
It truly is a downright disgrace,
why, oh w h y , can't people mind
their o w n business.
It is hard to be a 'real' christian
at I C . T . H . Huxley didn't believe
in god yet they named the maths
building after h i m , while Jesus,
who did, was nailed to a tree. When
will we hear the whole story?
In this day and age surely we can
expect higher standards o f oral
hygiene. What do they teach school
children these days?
I say we must return to the old
values. N o more lax morals, easy
money and fast girls. I can still
meals each week, regardless o f
whether they ate them or not. This
decision was taken when there were
no students around to raise their
objections.
It is impossible for all residents
to attend meals at 6 p m each
w e e k d a y e v e n i n g . R e s i d e n t s
involved with many societies and
clubs, working late in college,
going home, not liking the meal on
offer, or simply going out, either
cannot be at all meals, or do not
need one.
Unfortunately this new policy has
proposed changes was expressed,
we were not unduly surprised that
the results o f the questionnaire and
the specific comments made were
not passed on to the working party
for their consideration. W h y should
they be, when the discussion by the
Board o f Studies o n 23 rd October
had already been pre-empted by the
statement in the 'College Plan
1991-92 to 1994-95' published
during the summer, which clearly
states ' T h e u t i l i s a t i o n o f
accommodation will be increased
during the 1992-93 session by
teaching outside o f currently
timetabled hours...'
Yours sincerely,
Laura Barker, Secretary,
ICAUT.
ha'penny
remember the days when bread cost
tuppence h a ' penny. That's called
inflation. O f course all this can be
blamed on the abysmal level o f
student grants.
However, I C what y o u are
getting at with your 'pussy' fetish.
I would like to commend y o u on
your coverage of the recent spate of
dog buggering attacks.
Poetic justice has little to do with
rhyming couplets or the judicial
system in Marxist Britain.
So, why does T o n y Tiger wear
panty liners with security tabs?

P.S. A l s o to the person who
threw up in the foyer last Friday:
W E L L D O N E ! !
stopped many residents from
joining any clubs and societies
which require them to miss their
evening meals. With a rent bill this
term of £874.95 (single room), they
feel that they cannot afford to do
this. It is wrong to discourage
residents—the majority o f whom
are first years, from involving
themselves with the sports, hobbies
and socialising that is as much a part
of university life as the academic
work.
These problems cannot simply be
resolved by changing the time o f the
meals, as has been suggested.
Apart from our objections to this
new system for financial and social
reasons, there is also a moral issue.
T h e Catering Department now
prepare about 188 meals each
evening, regardless o f whether they
are to be eaten or not. A survey o f
159 residents revealed that during
the week, M o n d a y 7 - Friday 11
October 1991, at least 2 5 % o f the
food prepared for these residents
was thrown away. W e find this
level o f wastage unacceptable.
Attempts have been made to
introduce a packed tea option. This
was originally only available on
Wednesdays and Fridays, but is
now available throughout the week.
Linstead residents pay £2.95 per
meal, and yet I calculated the value
of the packed tea to be less than £2.
Residents are now telling me that
the value has been reduced further
still.
The whole situation is totally
unsatisfactory. W e want the old
signing-out and rebate system to be
re-introduced immediately.
I have been in contact with
College Administration, but so far
have got absolutely nowhere. I am
hoping that we can reach some
solution before next term—by
which time at least 2,000 meals will
have been thrown away.
Yours sincerely,
Elizabeth J Holmes,
Hall Convenor.
