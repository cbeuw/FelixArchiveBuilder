Education in Notting Hill
If asked, any education
official could accurately say
that within a particular
school the education a child
receives in no way depends
on the child's colour. How-
ever he probably won't go
on to say that the coloured
child gets considerably less
from his years in school than
his white friends. This fact
is very clear among the West
Indian population of Notting
Hill where coloured children
always do less well academi-
cally than their white coun-
terparts.
The West Indian slave
society—in which the family
unit was completely des-
troyed—still leaves on the
West Indian character the
scars of apathy and irres-
ponsibility which perhaps
only time will remove com-
pletely. The environment of
the average West Indian boy
is not in the least conducive
to intellectual growth or
social responsibility; and
lastly his parent's attitude to
his education is likely to be
one of two things: either non
existent, or the 'work now—

W e l c o m e to the rat race
We don't know why the rat has become the
pejorative symbol of the human condition.
Everything struggles for survival; why single
one out? Forget the headline—Albright & Wilson
say 'Welcome to the human race'.
Now you're about to become a fully paid up
member—may we tell you why you'd be happy
with us.
First we offer interesting work. This is
important. No one achieves anything unless
they're interested.
We offer scope for progress—in responsibility
and pay—within our organisation.
We offer financial rewards; the opportunity
to Work in many parts of Britain, and the world
the chance to become professional in your
skill and to keep up with the new knowledge and
techniques in your field.
We are in the expanding field of chemicals,
suppliers to hundreds of industries—on a
world-wide basis—of essential materials in
intermediate orfinishedform.
We need chemists for Research and
Development, and for Marketing and Production,
but we need other graduates, too. There are
career opportunities for Marketing Men,
Chemical Engineers, Computer Programmers,
Production Managers, Works Engineers,

enjoy yourself later' ap-
proach which he will ignore
in favour of the obvious
alternative. Thus both soci-
ally and psychologically
everything works against the
West Indian boy making the
most of the education offered
him; and tends to leave him
uninterested in anything
other than the more frivo-
lous pleasures.
This problem in the Not-
ting Hill area was first tack-
led by the people of Com-
munity House; and was thus
linked through the Chairman
of OSS, Keith Lindsay, with
Imperial College. Members
of their Youth Groups were
encouraged to bring along
their homework problems
and get help and advice from
Youth Group organizers.
This really brought their
needs to light, and as a re-
sult one evening a week was
devoted completely to home-
work classes. In fact a two
tier system evolved; firstly
a somewhat random system
for immediate help with par-
ticular problems which
allows people to observe;
and be observed. Secondly
a system of personal tuition
was set up for some of the
boys. This tutor system has
many obvious advantages,
giving a feeling of continuity
to both tutor and tutee, and
allowing the tutor quite inti-
mate contact with the boy's
milieu.
A person from I.C. who
agrees to help with these
classes will probably after
a short time of general help
and observation, agree to
become a personal tutor to
one of the boys; and to take
on responsibility for arrang-
ing lessons. Space—although
in short supply—is available
at Community House, but
often tutors visit their pupil
at home. In this way the
tutor can become more
aware of the particular prob-
lems facing the boy — and
also getting to know the
boy's parents can be very
illuminating.
The details of the lessons
are entirely a matter for the
tutor—but certain objectives
are always kept in mind.
Anyone teaching a secon-
dary school boy must obvi-
ously to some extent teach
toward examinations, those
teaching younger boys are
luckier in having a broader
scope. However the main ob-
jectives must surely be to
help the boy appreciate
science and art as more than
O-level subjects and to intro-
duce him to worlds of crea-
tive science and art. Also,
and not less important, to
help him, through his intel-
lectual growth, to disentan-
gle himself from his envir-
onment in order to be able
to think about the problems
of- society as a whole (into
which he may have consid-
erable insight).
This for me is where all
the enjoyment of this work
lies: to try, while teaching
towards the obvious objec-
tive of O-levels, to instill in
my pupil awareness; aware-
ness of his own self; aware-
ness of what he can be to
society; and awareness of
what he can inherit from
society—its past achieve-
ments and failures and most
important its hopes for the
future.

Current Diversification
At their meeting on October 29th, the Board of Studies
asked the Pro-Rector to oversee the current arrangements for
the provision of non-technical studies in the college and, by
means of regular meetings with the staff involved in these
activities, to explore what can be done to meet the increasing
demand for these studies.
Administrative support is being provided for the Pro-
Rector by the General Studies Office. Mr. Goodlad of the
Electrical Engineering Department is gathering information
and convening informal meetings of interested persons.
The first meeting of the "Diversification and Co-ordination
Committee" is scheduled for February 4th. As 1C Union Aca-
demic Affairs Officer 1 have been asked to report on the
views of the Union. Apart from presenting the motions
passed at Union meetings 1 should be interested in putting
forward the views of those who are opposed to diversifica-
tion, or in any way feel unhappy about it. Needless to say I
should also like to hear from those interested in diversifica-
tion!
Areas in which people may like to express views could be,
for example, purpose of the UG degree, relationship of de-
gree to future employment, development of individual talents,
type of diversification wanted (both technical and non-tech-
nical), should such courses be given in the first year or last
(or indeed, throughout the three years), whether such courses
be assessed and if so what proportion of the total degree
marks should they carry and so on.
If you seek any specific information about current goings
on please see Mrs. Ward-Bailey, Room 572, College Block,
and let me have your views and opinions as soon as possible.
