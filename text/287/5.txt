I C A
PLAY
ORBIT
Nash House is near the east end of the M all not too far from Westminster tube station.
Until February 15 it holds an exhibition staged by the Institute of Contemporary Arts
under the title of "Play Orbit'. The purpose of the exhibition is to try and illustrate some
of the new toys and "playables" now available to both young and old.
In the first of a number of brightly coloured rooms is arranged the smaller pieces of
the exhibition. These include a number of psychedelic jigsaws (very difficult), some medi-
ocre dolls and puzzles, but also two "Teddy Bears" with rubber John Betjeman faces.
The latter "Betjeman Dolls by John Haworth" may be pulled into almost any deformity,
with little difficulty.
CHOP
Farther in is a gruesome
assemblage of chains and
axes carefully arranged in a
wooden box. This game, yes
game, was aptly named
"Chop" by its maker, Vic-
tor Newsome. Also included
are a comprehensive set of
rules but frankly this isn't
the toy for 1970's Christmas
stocking.
Nearby in a green-walled
room is a device for re-
arranging proverbs. Really
this is just a novelty but
it's still surprising how much
unconscious humour and
dirt is hidden in these inno-
cuous phrases. You might
also find a box that makes
noises, some building bricks
hinged together, and a num-
ber of diabolically simple
jigsaws.
Not far away is the next
roomful of curiosities. Large,
yellow and L-shaped, in my
mind it contains the more
fascinating of the exhibits
displayed. Lying on a couch
are a number of red PVC
"limbs" which clip together
to form—well that's up to
you. Opposite is a hanging
"tree" of pale spongy
material — which to the
untrained eye could be mis-
taken for a collection of
baseball gloves.

London New Arts Lab
At one end of Robert
Street are some red glass-
pannelled doors reminiscent
of a fire station, and written
above them 'Institute of
Research in Art and Tech-
nology — London New Arts
Lab'.
Inside two events are
about to begin: Warhols
film 'Lonesome Cowboys'
and 'The People Show' —
'somewhere to sit, something
to eat and a place to be
sick in' . . .
A 5/- ticket to 'The People
Show' will buy you entrance
and coffee, 6/6 soup and
roll as well. You walk into
the room, dimly lit with
pink and green lights. Blocks
of empty chairs are arranged
at the far end. Beneath a
lampshade hung with pipe
cleaner swastikas someone
is typing and beside them a
gramophone plays dust-
damaged Maurice Chevalier.
Significance seekers can re-
flect on a mound of assorted
rubbish spread across the
floor. What about audience,
actors, action? These are
embodied in one and the
same person — you. The
usher appears 'Is there any-
thing madam would like?
A newspaper, a bowl of
soup?' He returns with the
Evening Standard. 'If there
should be an air raid, the
shelter is through that door'
Downstairs, macrobiotic
food — Japanese green tea
and whole wheat buttered
bread are on sale and In-
ternational Times, Rolling
Stone etc from the bookstall.
Membership of the Arts Lab
is 2/6 for one day (i.e. price
of ticket + 2/6) or 10/- a
year for students, only on
production of N.U.S. card.
However student member-
ship (on production of your
N.U.S. card and 10/6) of the
New Cinema club, which
shows some of its films at
the Arts Lab, entitles you
to go into programmes at
the Arts Lab, Round House,
Electric Cinema Club and
several other similar
societies. The New Cinema
Club is showing the Dylan
film 'Don't Look Back' on
3 February. Free pro-
grammes of films and details

TIN MAN
Just as curious but
apparently purposeless is a
lifesize tin politician built
by John Willats. On press-
ing a ballot card into an
adjoining box, he will
simulate the actions of most
politicians by blowing into
a red balloon. Passing on
it's difficult to miss a large
white box whose lead is
plugged into a wall socket.
When in use it may be
driven around by operating
controls inside. However,
once inside, there is no way
of knowing in which direc-
tion you are travelling —
which could explain the fact
that it's not in working
order.
While some in my opinion
are highly creative, other ex-
hibits tend to be extensions
of familiar toys; an example
is the cuddly toy brand of
snake by Lise Bayer. Also
an extension yet still some-
how original is the 3-dimen-
sional snakes and ladders
built by Kingston College
of Art. Marbles replace the
familiar coloured counters.
ART AT IC?
The exhibition might well
be beneficial and interesting
to anyone in IC with even
vague leanings towards art.
One of my own favourite
exhibits, illustrates the now
popular usage of the Scien-
ces in Art. It's a walking
robot, built by Dick Bixby
and Hugh Baird, called
simply Oswald.
And for those who feel
the exhibition really did
lift them to greater things,
there is on sale a collection
of posters and prints of
widely varying design and
theme. Most are in a sensible
price range and would
ideally fill that blank gap
on your wall.
ART DRAMA
Two days from now, as
a part of the above exhibi-
tion. ICA is staging, what
can best be described as a
happening by involving a
computer in a dramatic
production. The game/play,
devised by John Wood, will
be acted out by the Man-
chester College of Art and
Design Drama department
at 12 noon, 2 pm and 4 pm.
The purpose of using the
computer is to bring an
element of randomness into
the production, and each
performance is unique, the
plot being dependent upon
the mechanised soundtrack
and the rules of the game
itself. The only constant in
the play is its title — "King
of Shouting House" — and
it is around the fantasy
court of Shouting House
that the play is located.
Electronic music is supplied
by David Piper and direc-
tion was by Gerald McNally.
Those interested might
phone the Institute of Con-
temporary Arts 930-0493.
