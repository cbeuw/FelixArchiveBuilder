"RENAISSANCE"
ILPS 9114
Both Jimmy Page and
Jeff Beck have had in-
dividual successes since
leaving the Yardbirds, and
now from the same origin
Keith Relf has formed his
own group, Renaissance.
With the exception of his
sister Jane, all of the mem-
bers have been disenchanted
in their former fields. Both
Keith and Jim McCarty.
and even the producer Paul
Samwell-Smith, were under
the money making yoke of
Mickie Most, while John
Hawken is ex-Nashville
Teens and Louis Cennamo
is ex-Chicago Line Blues
Band.
Their sound is unclassifi-
able as John on piano and
harpsichord, and Louis on
bass have a pursuing
classical effect on Keith and
Jim's basic melodies.
Many of the tracks are
made up of smaller sections,
each identifiable with every
walk of life, but the entire
combination produces an
album worthy of its title.
On "Island", the tune
sung by Jane is^abruptly in-
tercepted by harpsichord
instrumental and then re-
turns at the end.
I must admit that I iden-
tify the basic melody of
"Kings and Queens" with
"Shapes of Things", but the
build up around it disguises
the original melody.
Louis is an extremely
competent guitarist and is
most noticeable on "Inno-
cence" while I like harpsi-
chord on "Wanderer". The
longest track "Bullet"
seemed to drag without
acheiving any positive ob-
jective, sadly. Just as in the
fourteenth century, Renais-
sance could be the start of
a new way of thinking,
although I doubt if it will
be quite as revolutionary.

"BITTER SWEET"
IRA 211
This group were the first
to record "Both Sides Now"
in Britain and on this
their fourth album they do
a treatment of another Joni
Mitchell number "Marcie".
The title track is a Gordon
Lightfoot number, as also
is "The Gypsy". The choice
of material by this trio can
hardly be said to be biased
as it ranges from a medley
of reels learnt by the
guitarist Mick Moloney, and
other traditional numbers
like "The Spanish Lady", a
Dublin street song, to con-
temporary c l a s s i c s like
Leonard Cohen's "The story
of Isaac" and Ewan Mac-
Coll's "Jesus Was A Car-
penter."
An interesting collection
of instruments is used on
some tracks and the finished
effect shows them to be one
of Britain's most consistent
folk groups.
KEITH CHRISTMAS
"STIMULUS"
SF 8059
Press adverts for this
record read "folk-rock for
your mind", and, as a very
early release for Keith, is
enough to promote consider-
able interest in him. Besides
being an undergraduate at
Bristol, the fact that he dis-
likes the environment in
London deters him from
making many appearances
here. I was lucky enough to
see him play in the summer
and was impressed by his
intentness in playing.
C O M E T H E R E V O L U T I O N
When the socialist peoples' paradise of I'SK secedes from
the pawn of reactionary Imperialism, ULU, certain changes
will have to be made to prevent revisionist fascists and
capitalists from corroding our pillar of revolution.
The first step in our path is the suppression of that
apologist-fascist publication, FELIX. (N.B. The peoples of
the glorious USK use Afrikaaner Mike's definition of a
fascist — one who disagrees with CEFE — instead of the
Imperialist's dictionary definition). The Editor of that rag,
FELIX, must learn that he is not permitted to edit long
and boring articles submitted by the peoples' representatives,
nor is he allowed to publish any Xeptionally "fascist" rub-
bish! The oppressed workers who slave to put out this re-
actionary muck will be rehabilitated and be given- the
privelege of duplicating USK maps and pumph-sheets.
In order to maintain the high quality of USK socialism
certain words and views will have to be re-aligned. We
have already redefined fascist. The word "please" will be
replaced by "we demand"; "scruffy yob" will in future
signify a socialist worker who has liberated himself from
the conventional regimentation of the capitalists; "boring"
will signify in most cases an explanation from first principles
of Union doctrines; "news" shall mean "biased comment";
and he who publishes the news shall be called "the man
who sits behind the Editor's desk and publishes what he is
told to".

RECORD
REVIEWS
On this record he is backed
by Mighty Baby and per-
forms seven of his own com-
positions. Naming a few,
"Bedsit Two-Step" shows
him to be a witty composer,
"Roundabout" shows his
good guitar-playing and
"Trial and Judgement"
shows him to be both good
writer and arranger.
