Student's View
contd. from page 1
boycott was irrelevant, that
all the action taken would
have happened anyway. This
is absurd! The committee
meeting on Thursday was
held specifically in response
to the boycott. A l l that
happened during the meet-
ing was a direct result of
the boycott. The blitz of
cleaning, cullminating in Mr.
Mooney's inspection on mon-
day morning, would surely
not have occurred if there
hadn't been trouble brewing.
The main effect, however, is
clearly a heightening of
awareness of the problems.
Felix Was the boycott a
personal attack on Mr.
Mooney?
J.G. No, as 1 said in the
bumph sheet. This was
directed against the whole
structure of, and complacent
attitude to, college catering.
Mr. Mooney has a difficult
job to do, and his difficulties
are clearly aggravated by
the financial straightjackets
imposed upon him.
No, this was an indication
of the strength of feeling
about both the quality of
meals and the generally lax
attitude of the authorities.
Felix What are your re-
actions to the criticisms of
your publicity sheet?
J.G. M r . Stephenson's
criticism that the refectories
operate within a budget is
twaddle. I made it quite
clear that I was talking
about capital expenditure,
not current expenditure. A n
example of this is the provi-
sion of a washing-up
machine in Southside. A n -
other example is the repair
of the fabric — in Southside
the cockroaches nest behind
three missing tiles. It seems
to me that some people are
opposed the discussion of
any form; viz M r . Stephen-
son's moans about Felix
Felicity and the Sun at the
emergency refectory com-
mittee meeting. If he thinks
he has cause for complaint
let him come to the Massive
Mooney Meeting and ex-
pound in public.
More tasty morsels to be found on the floor in Southside.
The Boycott
The Southside refectory
boycott happened last Tues-
day (the 20th), 5 days after
the Union meeting had de-
cided to hold it.
Public relations were done
over the weekend, with the
production and distribution
of 1000 bumph sheets. These
produced reactions from Mr.
Stevenson, amongst others.
(See interview).
Forewarned, the usual
S.S. clients were not unduly
surprised to meet with a
picket line when they arrived
for their Tuesday midday
Mooney. Corbyn, Webb and
Butterworth, and many
more, did sterling work in
gentle persuasion; neverthe-
less about seven people did
insist on breaking through
the line.
After a while it was
realised that people were
simply going upstairs to the
snack-bar, and that food was
being taken up there. The
pickets spread their sphere
of influence to the snack
bar instantly. Thus was the
boycott effected!
It was reported that some
rolls were taken over to the
shop, but since nobody knew
about that, very few were
sold. The shop as a whole
did record business.
Pickets wandered away
about 1.30, and some people
wandered into the refectory
rather mystified about the
lack of activity.
Since nobody quite knew
whether the boycott was all
day or lunchtime only, and
nobody was prepared to de-
cide, no pickets turned up in
the evening. This is reputed
to have surprised the staff,
who were expecting a lazy
evening and had gone home.
Few attend
discussions
The Monday lunchtime
informal discussions in the
Electrical Engineering De-
partment have been suffer-
ing from a lack of patronage
recently. The discussions,
usually after a short intro-
ductory chat cover anything
from birth control to trams.
Last year the discussions
were well attended by stu-
dents and staff, but now
both seem to be missing.
Sandwiches, biscuits and
coffee are provided in the
common room of level 6 at
1.00 p.m. everyone welcome
who wants to air views on
the subject being discussed.
Architectural
Association
Furthei to the article on
page one concerning the
Architectural Association,
there will be a happening in
the Great Hall, College
Block, at one o'clock today.
The A.A. is putting on some
form of review, according to
usually reliable sources, and
as many people as possible
are urged to attend to see
this amazing spectacle and
meet students from the A . A .
Moon Film
Not withstanding other at-
tractions last Thursday
lunchtime, about 300 stu-
dents and staff heard Lt-Col
Weiner of the U S A F talking
about the Apollo project.
Lt-Col Weiner's talk was
well illustrated with slides
and the IC premiere of the
Apollo 12 moon landing film
recently released by N A S A .
The audience seemed amused
by the americanisms and
appreciated Lt-Col Weiner's
concern that parts of the
film were American Propa-
ganda which was too much
even for a native! The talk
was concluded by a look at
the orbiting space station
due for launching in the
mid-seventies; men will be
spending up to two months
engaged in astronomy and
production of items such as
ball-bearings. In answer to
the question 'will the United
States put women into space'
Lt-Col Weiner said that it
was possible, but thought
they were too much trouble
on earth, let alone in space.
One and a half meetings
Since your last succulent
issue of Felix, there have
been one and a half Union
meetings. The first meeting,
a fortnight ago, discussed at
great length, a motion on
student representation on
various college committees.
This motion was met with a
bewildered silence from the
majority of people prescent,
with only a handfull of non-
apathetics chanting "co-adult
comunity" at frequent in-
tervals. The assembled com-
pany seemed equally bored

by a motion intended to
weaken the Rector's argu-
ments against the A . A . join-
ing I.C. on their conditions
and pledging our support for
the A . A . Union. The memor-
able feature of the Pre-
sident's report was that
N.U.S. cards are now avail-
able in the Union office.
The Great Hall stirred
back into activity to listen
to John Goodman's motion
to boycott Southside
Mooney. This motion, pre-
cipitated by the Cockroach
Disclosures in the last issue
of F E L I C I T Y brought to
light many complaints and
anecdotes. In a discussion
about the length of queues
it was revealed that three
years ago Mr. Mooney
blamed this on the students
who wasted time hesitating
between one succulent dish
and another. A point of in-
formation from the floor
revealed that the frequency
of appearance of meat balls
on the menu would be
greatly reduced if the cock-
roaches were removed. The
motion was passed and, for
reports on the resultant boy-
cott, see the front page of

Carnival
Happenings
The amazing Carnival
Concert HiM happen to-
night. Al Stewart and Brigid
St. John are appearing with
Gaswork in the College
Block this very eve, there
are still some tickets left, so
here is a chance to hear good
music, while it's on your
doorstep.
Just for the novelty Carni-
val is attempting the first
ever legal street collection
on the seventh of march, and
your help is needed to pull
this off. Other assorted
stunts include the "all-the-
tube-stations" record, to
which Watney's are kindly
giving financial support.
And entries for the G.P.O.
tower race on 6th february.
HITCHIKES
Your participation is es-
pecially required in two
hitch-hikes. The first, a
competition for the greatest
distance covered (somewhere
and back) in twenty-four
hours; and the second the
Five Capitals of Britain
race.
There are prizes for com-
petitors in both, and the lat-
ter also includes a competi-
tion to guess the time to
complete the race. So watch
for these or get information
from the Carnival office.
CAVING CLUB
Carnival would like the
support of more college
clubs like the heroes in the
Caving Club who were to be
seen recently with helmets,
caving grots, ladders and
ropes, travelling Under-
ground to Westminster
Bridge. Upon arrival, three
potholers descended to col-
lect samples of Thames
while bemused passers-by
were relieved of surplus cash
in aid of charity.
The police, who had been
watching this operation,
eventually recovered their
composure and moved the
intrepid explorers on. They
then decided to go down the
King's Road, where the in-
habitants, noticing their
trendy gear, showered them
with further contributions.
In all, the total collection for
Handicapped Children was
over £30.
While on the subject of
money it looks as though
we will have collected £6,000
by the end of term since the
Concert is making a profit
and another is likely later
on.
As a final remark, Carni-
val would like to get raffle
ticket selling over with soon,
so could the books be
handed in as soon as pos-
sible.
The meeting was adjourn-
ed for a week and re-
opened last Thursday to
rubber stamp the quinquen-
nium working party report.
The quorum was challenged
and the meeting fizzled out
with a belch and a fart.
