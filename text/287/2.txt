Southside Kitchens
Two weeks ago, Felix staff heard disturbing rumours con-
cerning the State of the hygiene in Southside kitchens and
incidents of cockroaches in the food. Felix staff therefore
visited the kitchens on a night early in the week, before
Felicity broke the news.
On that evening, there had been a late evening dinner.
Felix staff saw piles of dirty pans and unwashed plates left
out in the kitchens overnight. Clearly the kitchen staff had
dumped the dinner there and gone home!
Insects, notably cockroaches between \ and \ \ inches in
length, were crawling all over the walls and floors; the
machines, such as bacon slicers and potato peelers, were
covered by them! Even more 'roaches were tucking into the
trays of old uncovered food, and also into uncovered food
which the Felix staff thought would probably be used the
next day!
In all, the impression gained by Felix staff was one of
extreme filth and bad hygiene.
Leaving the dirty dishes, Felix staff moved on to investigate
the vegetable store.
As they opened the door, two mice ran out. Inside the
store-room, there were a few bags of vegetables, mostly
onions, which were completely covered by insects. At the
other end of the room, the floor was disgustingly dirty. Two
trays of old rat poison had been upturned, and a new one
left standing in the filth.
At least three of the Felix reporters present stated that they
would not eat at Southside again until the situation improved.
Two days later, Felix staff again toured the Southside kitchens in
the small hours. There were no unwashed plates, though not all the
pans had been cleaned, and trays of old food were uncovered. Two
cockroaches were seen to crawl into a paper bag full of fresh bread
rolls. A further few nights passed until Felix again looked in. The
standard of cleanliness was actually acceptable—the reason is soon
revealed by the notice on the office door to the effect that:
Mr. Mooney has instructed the College Block cleaners to come
over. You are to ensure that they get all the necessary cleaning
stuff and that every inch of the floor, including various store-
rooms, is covered, ready for inspection by Mr. Mooney on Monday
morning.
In other words, the situation was so bad that the Refectory Mana
ger had felt it necessary to call in extra help and give a full
weekend's warning of an inspection!

Throughout the country, under-
graduates have been reading our book-
"Graduate Careers in British
Leyland''. And a lot of them have
already made appointments to see us
when we call at their universities.
So the time is fast approaching when
you should do the same.
We are the only major British
owned motor manufacturers, with
outstanding technical
achievements to our credit -
the front wheel drive
transverse engine concept,
hydrolastic suspension, gas
turbine development, and a
new alloy "Prestal". These achieve-
ments have made us the country's
fifth largest company by sales value,
and its largest exporter.
So we need graduates of all
disciplines, for fifteen major functions
in six divisions of the Corporation.
Full details can be found in our book.
Read it, and make your appointment
with your Appointments Board before
it's too late. Your Appointments Board
can give you a copy. Or write to

After the steady increase in the criticism of the
Refectories by students, culminating in the boy-
cotts of the Southside (see front page), Felix re-
porter Tony Kirkham went to see the Refectory
Manager, Mr. V. J. G. Mooney, to ask for his com-
ments on the situation.
Mr. Mooney thought that the trouble had been brew-
ing for about six months now, and that in his opinion
the Refectories had become the current target for
criticism. All the staff in the Refectories were tired of
this attitude, which was reminiscent of the way all
school-children automatically grumble about school
dinners.
As for the Southside food, Mr. Mooney did not accept that
the standard was much lower than elsewhere. There were
many complaints last year, but now the work of the same
chef in College Block was regarded as the best food in Col-
lege!
The basic reason for all
the Southside troubles last
term had been the lack of a
good chef. The man Mr.
Mooney had hoped to get
to take over Southside had
been unable to come after
all; this was due to the 4
month's delay in opening
College Block. At the begin-
ning of last term, Southside
kitchens had been run by a
succession of poor chefs, re-
sulting in many complaints.
However, halfway through
the term the chef from the
staff buttery at 170 Queens-
gate was transferred to South
Southside. This stopped the
complaints, but this man was
taken ill shortly afterwards
and so the kitchens had to
struggle on without a chef
until Christmas.
Mr. Mooney also blamed
FELIX and FELICITY for
creating an anti-Southside
feeling, and also grumbled
that it was difficult to com-
municate with the present
ICU Council. Moreover, he
thought the comparatively
depressing atmosphere in
Southside did not assist en-
joyment of the food.
In all, an unfortunate term
for the kitchens. But Mr.
Mooney is convinced that the
standard will improve soon.
He has a new and competent
chef, with the recuperating
"170" chef as second-in-
command, and he looks for-
ward to the complaints dying
down.
The number of meals
served in the lower Re-
fectory at Southside has
dropped recently, and
now only 400 lunches
and 450 evening meals
are sold. There has also
been a drop in customers
for the waitress service
Southside restaurant,
though the snack bar is
still going strong.
Most of the Southside
customers have gone over
to the College Block, al-
though 200 have headed
for the Union lower re-
fectory, which now serves
about 500 per meal-time.
The total number of
customers is, moreover,
down on last year by a
sizeable factor.
A pile of empty pans waiting to be washed up. When told
of this, Mr. Mooney expressed surprise, and said it would be
due to staff problems.
I n f e s t a t i o n
Moving on to the alleged
cockroach infestation in
Southside, Mr. Mooney stated
that it was no worse than
most outside restaurants and
considerably better than
some. He cited the Savoy
where cockroaches are often
seen crawling across the din-
ingroom floor!
Cockroaches were basically
clean, harmless animals, de-
spite their ugly appearance,
and were a negligible health
hazard. Of much more con-
cern were the flies. College
Block in particular suffered
from large numbers of flies,
a nuisance which started dur-
ing the recent dustmen's
strike. Also, the Union kit-
chens were troubled by many
black beetles coming out of
the heating ducts.
In Southside, the problem
had been declining for a
number of years now, and
Rentokil hoped to drive out
the last 'roaches from the
crevices shortly. Moreover,
the Public Health Inspector
was offering advice.
D i r t y D i s h e s
When asked about the
dirty dishes left overnight in
the kitchens in Southside, Mr.
Mooney said that the staff
were supposed to clear up
completely and put away all
food before going home, but
they were often unwilling to
do this late at night. In Col-
lege Block this was not a
problem, thanks to a £2,000
pot-washing machine, but in
Southside everything had to
be done bv hand.
W o r k S t u d y
Lastly, the proposed Opera-
tions Research investigation
into his organisation. When
such a study was done at
Durham the suggestions in
the report were all "unsatis-
factory to operate" {Durham
Refec. Manager), and so the
report was shelved. Mr. Moo-
ney thinks the same will hap-
pen here, and all the report
will do will be to produce a
large number of unworkable
suggestions at great expense.
