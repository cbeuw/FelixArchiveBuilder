Brian Aldiss' latest novel
—The Hand-Reared Boy, A
novel for our times—spurts
onto the page in a massive
orgasm.
The dust jacket blurb
gleefully proclaims that it
touches on such " still
taboo areas of sexual ex-
perience as masturba-
tion . . .", "will expose the
poverty of art and human
involvement of the English
Middle classes". It wants to
"reveal the malformation of
spiritual and sexual life by
the anti-human preconcep-
tions of our century." Yes,
it's another exercise in that

famous perversion public
ffaggelation of the Middle
Glass by the Middle Class—
an exorcism of sexual spirits
lurking in our past.
The claim for a
humorous tone is borne out
—it has its moments :
"Show Rosemary your
cock", she said. There was a
lack of finesse in those
days!'—and there is none
of the earnestness of porno-
graphy; the writer cannot be
imagined with penis in one
hand and pen in the other.
Sex was taken up by these
children of the '20s and
'30s, as it still is today, with
the delight of tasting for-
bidden fruit. As the book de-
velops, more such fruits are
tasted — socialism (or com-
munism, they didn't know
the difference) and art. "Art,
Sex, Socialism. And the
greatest of these was sex."
Outside sex is changing, the
Abdication is forced on a
hapless monarch as the last
Hurrah of a declining
prudish generation.
But inside the public
school the amusing, stylised
hopping from bed to bed in
the dorms continues, hedged
about by taboos and rituals
making the relations never
quite relationships; and of
course "Sodomy and bug-
gery never seemed to enter
anyone's head . . ."
And the hypocrisy of the
sexual morals! Any boy
whose bed springs creak
loses face; there is a rule
of absolute secrecy in the
midst of absolute activity.
Oh dear, doesn't it all seem
to have been said before?
Assuming you have to
write about sex, (and why
not?) there are several ways
of approaching it. There is
Rabelais, with his rampant
pizzles and thundering oaths;
the pomographer and his
joyless, determined ap-
proach; then of course
there's the modern trendy
psychological novel.
GROPE
Poor old Brian Aldiss falls
right into the cess pit in the
middle, wherein we all dwell,
or so he claims. It is cer-
tainly not pornography, it
never reaches Pantagrualian
heights and althought spat-
tered throughout with psy-
chiatric terms, never really
tries to be psychological. Of
course it has its insights —
Horatio's post public-school
view of night-time London
as one large resonating dor-
mitory. And it certainly
gives food for thought — to
go with bis 'clutch of
penises", could we have a
"grope of vaginas"?
What does Aldiss want to
prove? He has a suitably
frantic hero for his novel of
our times, and the book does
set up resonances and recalls
our early days. And perhaps
he wants to change the old
sexual orthodoxy, to liberate
Brian Aldiss
us. I hope that when we are
liberated, we aren't changed
completely to the new ortho-
doxy, where instead of los-
ing face if your bed springs
creak, you lose face if they
don't.
As a liberation, the book
is a failure, an orgasm
calling us to yet more, and
we are promised, heaven pre-
serve us, three more books
chronicling Horatio's voyage
through life,

Anyway, what are universities for? Or more impor-
tant, What should they be for? They produce gradu-
ates—but what sort of graduates? And how do the
students take part in the process?
The answers to such questions are the basis of
Union policies. You know we want (jargon) a " partici-
pating co-adult academic community " etc. You know
why people are angry when they see Imperial College
attempting to destroy the Architectural Association's
enviable participating community. (Go there and see!)
You know I.C. is a science college, so why won't it
take a liberal experimtental line on the A.A. and
representation?
It seems that the Board of Studies won't be recon-
sidering our representation requests and our statements
about the A.A. merger and the so-called four areas of
" no participation " (one of which is ultimate decision
making) until February 18th.
No professor or member of the admiinstration has
put a comprehensive or coherent argument against
representation or experimentation as far as the A.A.
merger is concerned. They have had plenty of time!
Will any of them come to Touchstone on February
6th-7th? (What are Universities for?—you try and
come!) Anyhow, when the Board of Studies does con-
sider our requests, what if they say NO? Ideas please!
Direct Action
When the Queen came we had some effective " direct-
ish(?) action ". This helped our understanding a lot and
our policies a little.
Last Thursday we staged a highly successful South-
side Refectory boycott—as a result of which an emer-
gency refectory committee meeting was called. The
cockroaches should go soon and the non-student mem-
bers of the refectory committee will discuss things at
next week's U.G.M. If the food is not better by then,
the Union can decide on a full boycott.
Last Thursday we took direct action about the
A.A./I.C. merger. This showed that we are prepared
to take our beliefs seriously and we made this clear to
the college and all who hear us.
