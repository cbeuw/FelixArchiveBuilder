Through to Semi-Finals
Gutteridge Cup: IC 11 pts, QMC 3 pts.
Last Wednesday 21 Janu-
ary, I.C. 1st X V beat their
Q.M.C. counterparts in a
very hard, thrilling game to
go through to the semi-finals
of the Gutteridge Cup com-
petition between the Univer-
sity colleges,
Playing against the wind
in the first half I.C. were
soon in trouble against the
very well-drilled Q.M.C. for-
wards and Q.M.C. de-
servedly took the lead when
they kicked a 30 yard pen-
alty goal. However the whole
I.C. team stuck to their
tasks — especially the
centres whose tackling was
of the highest standard, Also
John Wild, the full back,
proved to be his usual
courageous self under pres-
sure.
The second half told a
different story — the I.C.
pack, well-led by veteran
Andy Powell, gradually took
command and with fly-half
John Ballard kicking well
down-wind, scores had to
come. First Clive Swinnerton
kicked a penalty goal to
equalise, then it took a
thrilling break by scrum-half
Jerry Stephenson to bring
about the next one. Going
on the blind side of ruck he
beat two men and gave right
ving Keith Devaney a half-
chance which he took
brilliantly to score in the
corner. Clive Swinnerton's
kick proved straight and true
from the touchline.
The score remained at
8—3 until nearly 10 minutes
from time. Constant I.C.
forward pressure brought a

Win for IC
After a moral boosting
game against Southampton
on Saturday in which a de-
pleted I.C. team beat
Southampton 2—1 for the
first time in years, I.C. en-
tertained Q.M.C.
From the start I.C. looked
really determined to avenge
one of their three defeats
this season. They were well
in control in the early stages,
but luck was not with them.
John Kelly hit both post and
crossbar with good efforts
before Q.M.C. took a sur-
prise lead. I.C. however still
controlled the game, but
were shocked with a second
goal scrambled by Q.M.C,
At half-time it was still
2—0. After the interval I.C.
tore right into Q.M.C. des-
perately trying for a goal. It
was not till 25 minutes from
the end that C. Wilcock re-
duced the arrears. Q.M.C.
now seemed tired and I.C.'s
fitness spurred them to two
further goals by T. Holland
and J. Darby. G . Barnard
and N . Fryer were prominent
in I.C.'s late revival.
In the lower teams, the
2nd X I drew 2—2 with
Q.M.C. 2nds. I.C. 5ths pro-
vided a shock by beating
I.C. 3rd 3—2 with captain
A. Jackson inspiring his men.
R O G E R D I X O N
ruck 10 yards out from the
Q.M.C. try line and prop
George Widelski was seen
to break free and score a
very important try in a
characteristic nonchalant
fashion. This time Swinner-
ton just missed the kick, al-
though he'd been almost suc-
cessful with 2 or 3 50
yarders.
This remained the final
score and I.C. play C.E.M.
in the semi-final on Wednes-
day 11 February. Full praise
to the whole I.C. team of
which every individual
played well and to single
anyone out would perhaps
be unfair but of a tremen-
dous pack of forwards the
all-round play of Ifor Rhys
must have made him man-
of - the - match in many
people's opinions.
There were a fair number
of supporters present who
gave just the extra impetus
needed by the team. Let's
have more, more and more
again for the SEMI-FINAL!
Team: John Wild, Roy
Anderson, John Kelly, K i p
Conolly, Keith Devaney,
John Ballard, Jerry Stephen-
son, Andy Clark, Andy
Powell, George Widelski,
Roger Peart, Steven Owens,
John Gardner, Clive Swin-
nerton and Ifor Rhys.

Hockey
After the first two games
of the team had been can-
celled due to unplayable
pitches, I C W A played their
first hockey match of the
season against Kings College
on January 17th. With three
regular players missing from
their defence, I C W A had to
be content to try and con-
tain the Kings side and limit
their own attacking moves to
occasional breakaways. The
final score of 1 all was an
encouraging result for this
weakened team.

stronger support from the
touchline, I C W A met a team
from Royal Holloway,

ICWA. In the second half,
however, I C W A dominated

EDITORIAL
The last two weeks have seen IC clubs moving into
challenging positions in the various U L competitions. The
Cross-country Club won the London Colleges league race
at Trent Park and now move into second place in the league.
The 1st X I football has had two good wins this term in the
league and now hold joint first position in the Premier
league, separated from Woolwich only by goal averages.
The rugby club, by now accustomed to bearing the brunt
of any written attacks, usually unjustified, in various College
publications, seemed to find the Q M C attack easier to deal
with last Wednesday and scored a fine 11—3 win to go into
the semi-finals of the Gutteridge Cup, which is contested by
all the London Colleges. Perhaps they will yet prove that
they are not merely a bunch of drunken vandals, as many
people seem to think, but are in fact fine athletes, well trained
as a team and excellent tacticians as individuals.
By the way, it seems to have gone un-noticed that
I C W A Hockey have only lost one game this season. They
are an entertaining team to watch and would welcome any
support, especially on February 7th when they play the U L
cup semi-final. J.C.D.
Cross Country
John Banks Trophy
In the Q M C 1\ mile race
last Saturday week, the
much-weakened IC team put
in a fine performance to win
the John Banks Trophy for
the first U L team home.
Conditions underfoot were
atrocious, most of the course
being over ploughed fields
and muddy paths. Overall,
IC were joint fifth with Ox-
ford, behind Cambridge (the
winners), Leeds, Southamp-
ton, and Borough Road.
First man home for IC was
Barry Dabrowski in 13th
position, out of a field of
over 100 starters.
League race
On the following Wednes-
day the London Colleges
League race was held at
Trent Park. Out of a field
of 140 starters Norman
Morisson of IC was the
clear winner. Overall, IC
won the race, 10 points
ahead of Q M C , and have
now reclaimed second posi-
tion in the League.
ICWA defenders move forwards after break-
ing up another Royal Holloway attack.
