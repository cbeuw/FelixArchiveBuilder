Direct
Action
A meeting of the Acade-
mic Working Party for the
A.A./I.C negotiations was
abandoned before business
commenced when students
entered the room to observe
the proceedings.
The meeting of the work-
ing party had been called to
produce "A definitive paper
on student participation".
This is the main stumbling
block to the merger which
has to be finalised by August
this year.
Students at the A.A. are
fully involved in the running
of their college. Two stud-
ents were invited to observe
this special meeting, Piers
Corbyns and a representa-
tive of the A.A.'s union.
Usually no students sit on
the working party.
In the Great Hall last
thursday the two hundred
and fifty students present
unanimously passed a mo-
tion before them "strongly
requesting that the meeting
of the working party be
held in public so that all in-
terested students from I.C.
and the A.A. may be present
to hear the discussion and
ask questions." A delegation
of eight was elected to con-
vey the motion to the work-
ing party, then in session,
with Piers Corbyn acting as
intermediary. The request
was refused immediately,
as was the delegation's fur-
ther request for the working
party to allow more ob-
servers.
On being told this by Piers
Corbyn, the students outside
started filing into the room
a few moments after Piers
took his place in the meet-
ing. The chairman, Profes-
sor Jones of the maths de-
partment, hurriedly aban-
doned the meeting.
IMPERIAL COLEGE UNION NO. 284 29th JANUARY, 1970
Massive
Mooney
Meeting
The last Union meeting
decided, as those who were
present will know, to hold
an open meeting on refec-
tories in all their many
facets. The refectory com-
mittee, Mr. Mooney, and
some of his manageresses
also wish to attend a Union
meeting, to be held in the
next two weeks.
The refectory committee
held an emergency meeting
on Thursday (immediately
after the Union meeting).
This meeting accepted the
invitation to the food Forum,
thought it was a good idea.
Apart from that, the meet-
ing consisted of Mr. Stephen-
son complaining of the cock-
roach publicity in Felix,
Felicity and the Sun. Mr.
Mooney related the saga of
the S/S chefs; and sugges-
tions on improving the
wages and quality of the
staff. Students on the com-
mittee also asked the staff
if they would condescend to
eat in lower S/S at least once
a week.
Explaining the philosophy
behind the motion John
Goodman said that Mr.
Mooney had been complain-
ing about a lack of com-
munication between the
various bodies concerned
with the refectories. In view
of this and the fact that the
student body had not had
an opportunity to put for-
ward constructive suggestions
for improvements, an open
forum would be a good idea.
This would be attended by
the refectory committee, the
caterers, and a representa-
tive of the administration
would be invited to explain
the college's attitude (es-
pecially to finance).
The question of a full boy-
cott has been put off until
after the open forum, which
will almost certainly be on
Thursday 8th. Posters will
be circulated, and it is hoped
the Great Hall will be filled!
Students are asked to think
of suggestions for improving
the college catering and also
o^ any complaints.

C a s e
John Goodman, who or-
ganised the boycott, gave his
views in an interview with
Felix.
Felix Why did you ar-
range the boycott?
J.G. I arranged the boy-
cott because of a general
feeling of discontent and
dissatisfaction with college
food. The cockroaches were
the last straw, and it was
clear that this was the issue
to arouse the student body.
Felix What were you try-
ing to prove?
J.G. I was trying to prove
(and succeeded in proving)
that direct action works. Mr.
Stephenson and the staff
members of the refectory
committee claim that the

Inconciusive Evidence
Last week, a meeting of
Tizard Hall Disciplinary
Committee was held to con-
sider the conduct of one of
its members. The meeting,
which was closed, considered
information that Mike Mul-
ler had been found at 9-30
one morning with a woman
in his bed. The information
(unconfirmed) which FELIX
lias, suggests that Miss
Smailes, the Tizard house-
keeper, was investigating the
lack of bog doors on Mul-
ler's staircase. She went to
see the staircase rep. (Mul-
ler) and saw two lumps in
his bed, one with a head
(his) and one without a head
in evidence.
Muller wrote a poem to
FELIX, (see page 3) which
says that he should not be
condemned for spending the
night a woman.
It is believed that this
would not constitute a de-
fence at a Disciplinary Com-
mittee hearing and yet no
action is to be taken due to
"inconclusive evidence".
FELIX concludes from
this that Muller denied the
"offence" at the committee
meeting. Comment overheard
in the Press Roomâ€”"There's
nothing wrong in what I
did, and anyway, I didn't do
it."
Some tasty morsels
in the kitchens
Felix asked Mr. Mooney
for his opinions on the
boycott. He gave the im-
pression of being upset and
offended by the boycott,
despite John Goodman's as-
surances that the action was
not intended as a personal
attack on him.
In his opinion the standard
of hygiene in S/S was ac-
ceptable and the food was
not any worse than the other
refectories. The boycott to
him was pointless; it would
achieve nothing, and the
only people who would lose
would be the customers, as
the financial loss entailed by
the boycott could only be
passed onto them.
Mr. Mooney said that the
kitchen staff in S/S were
more annoyed than he him-
The
Other
Side

Story
self was. The staff were par-
ticularly annoyed when they
could not recognise many of
the pickets as regular users
of the refectory. They were
also offended that the stu-
dents found their food inedi-
ble. Moreover, said Mr.
Mooney, there was the un-
derlying fear that, if the
situation got worse, the kit-
chens might close and the
staff would almost all lose
their jobs.
Mr. Mooney also men-
tioned that the boycott had
taken him by surprise. He
had only heard of it that
morning (tuesday) and did
not think that the students
had time to organise their
protest. In fact, he was pre-
paring for the boycott the
following day, Wednesday.

Student
badly cut
The disco at the last I.C.
hop had to be closed early
following some trouble be-
tween visiting skinheads and
a boy from Chelsea college.
REPORTS differ as to the
events leading up to the in-
cident, but it seems that
Terence Davidson was sitting
telling a joke to his girl
friend when a skinhead, who
possibly thought they were
laughing at him, thrust a
beer glass into Davidson's
face, cutting it badly, Tim,
the DJ, closed the disco im-
mediately and turned on the
lights; a boy was appre-
hended at the door and was
taken to the police station for
the night. Earlier in the
evening there was another
incident in the Beit quad-
rangle which resulted in
someone from the Health
Centre being called to treat
a girl who was injured.
There were several skin-
heads at the dance but it is
reported that all had Stu-
dents' Union cards. The
dance itself was a success,
but more as a concert given
by the Procul Harum, since
there were so many people
it was impossible for anyone
to dance.
Obituary
Alistair Buchanan
The R.C.S.A. has suffered
a grievous and irreperable
loss through the death of
Alistair Buchanan on 6th
January 1970. As President
of the R.C.S.A. for three
years, he stimulated and in-
fused new life into what was
virtually a dying Associa-
tion. His enthusiasm, ready
wit, and selfless character
were an inspiration to all
who worked with and for
him. His interests and friends
were legion. As an old stu-
dent (1927) of the Depart-
ment of Chemistry, he has
shed lustre for all time on
Imperial College.
