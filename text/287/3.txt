ON BOYCOTTS
DISH-WASHERS
AND C.E.F.E.
So Piers awakens on a Tuesday morning and decides to
hold a boycott of Southside Lower Refectory, Snack Bar
and Shop. Naturally it was very effective, taking everyone
by surprise, including the bloke who was to organise it,
and causing Southside refectory to close down in the evening.
That there was cause for a boycott there is not much doubt,
not only in view of the cockroaches that even the food can't
kill, but also considering the unwashed crockery and un-
covered food left overnight; nevertheless, how did council
arrange it that the boycott organising should be left to the
whim of the president or any other one person? The only
thing to recommend the way the boycott was held was the
fact it worked.
The College Block refectories have the use of a dish-
washing machine (at £2,000) whics takes up a great deal of
the work-load which would normally fall on the kitchen staff.
Southside has no such machine, which could well account for
the aforementioned unwashed dishes which the staff would
be understandably reluctant to start on at the end of the day.
The purchase of such a machine for Southside would auto-
matically cut down the amount of filth left in the kitchens,
which is part way to solving the bug-problem.
Finally, C.E.F.E., and 'is that fat cat getting lazy?'.
This is the sort of remark which fails to endear this so-called
branch of the I.C. left-wing to the FELIX editorial staff
who have to spend a good deal more time working on
FELIX than they would like. We have dead-lines to meet
and copy spaces to fill with a certain amount, and only a
certain amount, of copy, so if C.E.F.E. or anyone else would
like to see a newspaper comprised solely of 1500 word articles
diversification, participation, representation, resurgitation,
etc., etc., I suggest they write them themselves, post them to
themselves and read them themselves.

self, or by allowing sub-
editing by Felix.
The first point is more
subtle and strikes at the very
roots of news coverage. Any
newspaper which has an in-
telligent readership of people
holding all shades of opinion
on various subjects, must, if
it is to be respected, present
news in a readable, informed
and unbiased manner, and
under no account be a vehicle
for the personal views of the
contributor. Unfortunately
some of Felix's most prolific
contributors are suffering
from the malaise of writing
opinionated news and some-
times refusing to rewrite their
articles in an unbiased form.
It is reasonable that if Felix
is to maintain credibility as
an informed disseminator of
news throughout the college
it must unfortunately refuse
such biased copy, even if
this means that news cover-
age is not as adequate as it
could be.

Dear Ian,
Recently Felix has come
under criticism over its news
contents, in that there isn't
enough of it and that when
proferred, is often refused or
radically altered by Felix
sub-editors.
The first factor is partially
explainable by staff shortage
and the lessening willingness
of constituent colleges to for-
ward copy usable in their
own publications.
On the vexed question of
refusing news, this has arisen
because some of Felix's valu-
able and original contributors
seem to be losing sight of
"what is news and what is
opinion?" or sending copy
which is important but in
a style which does not induce
a less involved reader of the
article to read the whole
length of the article or to note
its most salient points. The
second point is the lesser of
the two evils, and easily cur-
able by the contributor him-

Dear Sir,
Whilst not wishing to im-
ply that editorial freedom be
curtailed I should none the
less like to express my pro-
test that my open letter on
'Diversification' was not
printed. This was a very im-
portant letter and its omission
will only lead staff to con-
clude that the students re-
gard 'The Trials of an Un-
trendy Person' and the 'Fair-
port Convention' as being
more important than their
education.
Yours in protest,
BRIAN HAINS.
Golden Apples for USK ?
Sir,
1 note with grave displeasure your continued use of the word beautiful to describe the
female human beings attending such establishments as the Institut Francais, Maria Assumpta,
etc. The word is not only untrue but also a rather silly choice of compliment, if such it was
intended to be. A "pretty" girl is far more attractive to a male than a beautiful one.

Better brains back into

The Editor.
Dear Sir,
There is one fundamental
area of the Shirley-Williams
report (on how to accommo-
date the increased numbers
of eligible students in the
higher education sector while
keeping costs down) that
deserves special attention.
This is the assumption that
the majority of these stu-
dents should receive a uni-
versity type education.
There is only one mention
of the colleges of education
by them". Surely this is
a most important sector for
expansion. It is time to raise
these colleges from the sec-
ond class alternatives to uni-
versity that they tend now
to be, and to divert from irre-
levant occupations many
prospective arts students.
Why?
The talk is of admitting to
university all those who are
"capable of benefiting from
the type of education unique-
ly available in universities".
What though is this education
that is so unique? Is it the
much vaunted "critical edu-
cation"? One would hope so.
Yet as we know, the present
system does not provide this.
And it is not entirely the fault
of the universities. For they
can deal only with the prod-
ucts of the preceding sectors
of education and it is prob-
able that, if there were to be
an emphasis on creative
thought, many of the present
university students, with their
educational backgrounds,
would not be able to cope.
This is why it is important
to concentrate on the colleges
of education. For if sufficient
of the creative minds who
would otherwise be given a
university education could be
diverted to colleges of educa-
tion, the standards of teach-
ing would rise, the type of
education would change and
the position would arise with-
in a generation in which the
majority of school-leavers
could benefit from a critical
education.
That there is a need for a
new approach in the pre-
university sector is clearly
evident; it is only some weeks
since the teachers were in the
streets and they're not only
asking for money. Wouldn't
it be nice if the government
were to take the logical step
and attack the problems of
teaching and education at all
levels, starting by attracting
(or forcing perhaps, if you
consider the implications of
expanding the colleges of
education and not the univer-
sities) the 'better brains' back
into the schools.
Yours,
MIKE MULLER.
OPEN POEM
Authority
why must you continually
bug me ?
You see the things I've got
and call me
bankrupt (morally)
I'm not.
You find a woman in bed with me
o tragedy and scandal —
your shocked faces
outraged appearance
might lead people to believe
that I'm a vandal.
You take our expression of love,
rub it in the dust
label it " HIS LUST "
accusing me of immorality.
You take her body
smeared by your hands
(which are dirty)
and accuse her of promiscuity !
You interrupt
the most beautiful
moment —
then complain if
I'm abrupt.
You (so you say)
act this way
only till the day
when we know/have accepted
your way
as right.
But hell, I'll fight!
You're not allowed to cloud
my light,
shadow the bright moments of happiness ;
render impotent my bliss.
I've been living a while,
travelling and loving;
made friends in a hundred
foreign tongues,
danced naked under their suns.
And now, you dare accuse me
— or did I expose your poverty
of being happy !
the lackluster irrelevance of your reality?
if so, I'm sorry.
Mike Muller
