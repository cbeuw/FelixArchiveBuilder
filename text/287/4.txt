S O U T H A F R I C A :
EPITOMY OF EVIL, OR JUST INVERTED CAPITALISM?
"Fascists go home!" shout
the middle-class, long haired
demonstrators, worrying no-
one except perhaps the
parents of those arrested.
"Britain can do nothing
to make S.A. change her
policies" says an unen-
lightened one. apparently
unaware that SA is Britain's
second largest trading part-
ner.
Most people here know
very little about South
Africa. They think for a
start that it's uniformly
warm — the winters there
can be hell. Often trying to
talk about the conflict bet-
ween the Afrikaner South
Africans and the English
speaking ones, I find that
people believe that all
whites in South Africa speak
English. Whereas in fact of
course, the antipathy bet-
ween the two groups is a
key factor in South African
politics.
It arises out of the
Englishmen's contempt for
the Afrikaners' pastoral
background, and the
Afrikaners resentment at
this. At one stage, this anti-
pathy could have been a
possibility for diverting the
Afrikaner (and thus South
Africa) from the paths of
capitalism; the old guard
Afrikaner was very high-
principled and not overly
materialistic. ("Scratch the
back of an Afrikaner and
you find a Socialist", said
somebody in 1939).
But, like most peoples
brought into contact with
Western culture and con-
cepts of progress, the attrac-
tion of consumer goods,
plastic pleasures and dis-
tracting comforts was over-
whelming. And the story of
the Afrikaner in South
Africa of late is the story
of a people learning and
applying the aims of Western
life — material comfort
(=money) and power.
In 1948, the Afrikaner
achieved political power. It
took ten years for them to
realise something that the
Labour Government here
pretend not to realise: that
political power is not enough
to control a country, you
must have a finger in the
economic pie. Once they had
realised this, the Afrikaner
moved sharply. A decade

ago, their share in the
countries commerce was
approximately 5%. It is
now approaching 40%.
It is predictable that as
the connection between the
business and political sectors
gets stronger, we shall see
good capitalist viewpoints
emerging. These are certain
to be against apartheid—for
apartheid is counter to the
trends of rationalism in in-
dustry. So the demise of
apartheid is easily predict-
able on economic grounds
(as was the revolution in
Germany and England in
Marx's time!)
Will this mean freedom
for the South African
Blacks? YES! says Helen
Suzman of the so-called Pro-
gressive Party, representing
the richest constituency in
the country (all Jewish
financiers). Yes! say all the
good capitalists, knowing
that they will still have their
investments to be run more
efficiently by "emancipated"
black labour.
Of course, for the Africans,
the change will not be great.
The opportunity will be
there for 'advancement', for
the self-made mefl; but how
many Terence Stamps and
Dave Baileys emerge from
the East End working class
areas?? For this is all that
the end of apartheid will
mean in these circumstances
—the creation of a working
class out of an oppressed
class. Its just a more subtle
means of exploitation.
Personally, I prefer SA as
it is now. At least the issues
remain clear, and we still
have the amusement of
white men being turned
away from hospital because
they've BEEN STUNG
BLACK (and blue) by bees!

Films not blessed with
the approval of the British
Board of Film Censors,
essential for exhibition in
the commercial cinema, pro-
vide film societies and
cinema clubs (who don't
admit the general public)
with the controversial
material which, depending
on one's attitude towards
"those who know best",
makes film societies and
cinema clubs either outlets
of free artistic expression or
dens of pornography for
moral deviants.
Roger Corman, after a
decade of directing science
fiOtion and horror films has
fallen foul of the censor with
two films, "The Trip" and
"The Wild Angels" which
deal respectively with drugs
and motor-cycle rebels.
"THE TRIP" was written
by Jack Nicholson (the
alcoholic lawyer of "Easy
Rider") and features Peter
Fonda and Dennis Hopper
(producer, director and co-
actors of "Easy Rider")
Susan Strasberg and Bruce
Dern. The censor was clearly
unimpressed by the charm-
ing note tacked on "The
Trip" warning of the dangers
of drugs: everything is
shown to be quite ecstatic
and pleasurable. Mr. Cor-
man bases its plotless
images on his own ex-
periences under the in-
fluence of LSD as he
follows Fonda, as a dis-
illusioned director of T V
commercials, on a trip
around town.
Bo Widerberg has direc-
ted six full length feature
films. "ELVIRA MADI-
GAN" was released last
year and is in great demand
for film society screening
after wide distribution at
specialist cinemas in many
1
provincial centres. It is
based on a true story, well
known in Sweden, of the
doomed love of a young and
beautiful tight-rope walker
with an army officer who
leaves wife, children and
respected position to run
away with her. The fate of
Elvira and Sixten (played by
Pia Degermark and
Thommy Berggren) is pre-
destined since they cannot
compromise the life they
wish for with life as it is;
they know that life must
end. The visual and aural
settings of the story with
romantic ravishing detail
creates a lyrical elegy of
considerable beauty. Al-
though "Elvira Madigan"
was in no risk of censor
trouble, "Adalen '31",
Widerberg's latest film (now
at Academy One, reviewed
by Xris last term) may have
been. Taking the romantic
framework from "Elvira"
it tells of a strike which pro-
voked a riot and ultimately
the massacre of peaceful
marchers. It also tells of the
personal relationships within
the community; one particu-
lar scene of sexual explora-
tion by hypnosis would al-
most certainly have been cut
a year ago; the fact that
Academy Cinemas have not
exploited "Adalen '31" as
pornography (which it is
not) strengthens the censors'
decision.
Imperial College Film
Society will be screening
"Elvira Madigan" and "The
Trip" on Friday 6.2.70
(details in What's On).
"Adalen '31" and "The Wild
Angels" are likely material
for screening next season.

So at last something has happened. The great mass of apathetic gits
at I.C. have at last got off their fat arses and done something concrete,
something positive towards the A.A. negotiating impasse. It's a shame
it won't do any good.
It won't |do any good because nothing we do in this place is taken
seriously. We have the pantomime of J.U.R.G.O.—carefully designed so
that nothing happens and no decisions are made; we have our menial
representation on all the committees of the college that don't do anything
especially useful; we have condescending statements made to us about
how important student participation is on a departmental level (i.e. where
it won't have any effect); as long as we sit quite like tame cats lapping
up our milk of meanlingless concessions then everybody will be happy
—I.C. will function smoothly for the benefit of the establishment from
whence it came; as soon as we do something, so everybody goes mad.
As I write this, it is the evening of the raid on the A.A./I.C. negotiating
committee meeting and two days after the boycott of Mooney. By the
time you read this, the administration will have erupted. We shall be
damned, criticised, condemned. We were militant. We were stirred up by
militant agitators. We will be compared to L.S.E. A militant minority
is misrepresenting the views of the majority, etc., etc.
Part of this is partially true. Certainly those who took direct action
were not representative of the Union. But for all this is was a good thing,
because it made the masses suddenly enlightened. 'Our aim is to make
people so conscious of their environment, that they will get up and do
something about it' (—Zappa). 'Our aim is to make people aware'
(—Corbyn). NOW, amongst all the accusations hurled against them, I.C.
students will be able to get up and say how fed up they are with the
patronising attitude of the administration. They can say that hey wan
to be treated like adults and not a load of school kids. They alone can
'tell it like it is'.
But will them? Are the events of the past week dynamic and momentous
enough to arouse the dormant masses? They had better be; because unless
we unite now, unless we decide our policies and state our principles, unless
we can stand up for ourselves, I.C. Union will be finished, representation
will be finished, our contribution to the university will be finished, we will
become a nonentity.
It really is now or never.
