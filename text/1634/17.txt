Matrix of Eclairs
FELIX reviews Maitre Choux, a snazzy patisserie in South Kensington
E
ngineers are pretty
obsessed with matrices.
As someone from
Chemical Engineering,
I love matrices. Don’t get me
wrong here. I’m not talking about
MATLAB, maths, or even anything
related to numbers. I’m talking
about food. Matrices of food. There
is no better cure for OCD than
staring at perfectly positioned rows
of doughnuts.
One of those particular matrices
that always succeeds to stop me
in my tracks even while being 10
minutes late to a lecture is eclairs.
Eclairs from Maitre Choux.
Let’s start with the basics. What
are eclairs? Wikipedia defines them
as “an oblong pastry made with
choux dough filled with a cream and
topped with icing.” Or according
to my dear friend Carolyn – posh
I wonder if he leaves chocolate squares wherever he goes.

And Maitre Choux? To most
of you it may be just a patisserie
on the ooh-la-la French side of
South Kensington. In fact, it is
the world’s first and only choux
specialist patisserie where the three-
vMichelin star chef Joakim Prat
transforms the traditional French
delights into works of art.
You really have to go see for
yourself. The small shop with a
simple,white exterior with colourful
dots everywhere. You really cannot
miss it between the typical, boring,
old red brick houses. If you are
lucky, you also get a strong whiff
of that warm, cosy, aromatic scent
of baking choux drifting from the
ovens in the basement.
Walk closer to the window and you
will see what I meant by matrices of
eclairs. Neat, straight, perfect arrays
of eclairs in a rainbow of colours.
Bright red, apple green, sunflower
yellow. Rose pink, coffee brown,
shining gold. Each beautifully
decorated by hand with tender
loving care. Instagram moment.
Trust me, they are as good as they
look. A delicate, soft choux pastry
encasing a velvety smooth cream in
surprising and exotic flavours.Think
Persian pistachio, Tahitian vanilla
and… popcorn. They update their
creations every season like clothes
in a shop so you will never get
bored.Pleasure for the mind,mouth
and soul.
I mean, whoever thought this looked like a ballerina had clearly never actually seen one. Photo Credit: FELIX

N
ot as complex to make
as a fine éclair, but
with just as much flair
and style, a pavlova is a
delicious summer pudding. Hailing
from New Zealand or Australia,
depending on who you believe, it
was named after the famed ballerina
Anna Pavlova, whose ethereal frills
it resembles. It’s a pretty classic
dessert now – but for a very good
reason.What could go wrong with a
crispy, marshmallow-like cake with
heaps of whipped cream and fresh
fruit?
Well, the short answer is
everything. Pavlovas require a lot
of arm work – or an electric beater
– to make the meringue, which
after all that effort can split and
become watery in the oven. After
your careful beating and baking, the
meringue can then collapse as you
let it rest.
This recipe is designed to be as fool
proof as possible, but you do have to
follow all the steps as accurately as
possible!
Fruit wise, it’s entirely up to you –
I am particularly fond of a pavlova
Pavlov(a)’s dog
with mango, strawberries and
passion fruit, but will also happily
add pineapple, any fresh berries or
even thinly sliced apple. Just make
sure that it’s fresh, tasty and ideally
in season.
Ingredients:
6 egg whites, from medium eggs
– make sure there is absolutely no
egg yolk!
330g icing sugar (caster can be
used, but takes longer to dissolve)
2 teaspoons white vinegar
1 teaspoon cornflour
300mls whipping cream
Fresh fruit – see above
Speed is key here. Preheat the
oven to 120C – and don’t use
the fan. Line a baking tray with
greaseproof paper, and draw a circle
on it as a template for your pavlova.
Take a large mixing bowl and make
sure it is very clean – any fat will
stop the egg whites from whipping.
Add all the egg whites, and start
beating! It’s easiest to use a whisk,
though some people swear by a
fork. This stage is much easier with
electric beaters. Once they reach
very stiff peaks, start incorporating
the sugar, one tablespoon at a time.
The mixture should transform into
a glossy, smooth meringue. Feel
a small amount inbetween your
fingers – it should be completely
smooth, with no sugar. If there is
any, keep whisking to dissolve it.
When it’s all dissolved, fold in the
vinegar and cornflour. Scoop the
mixture onto your prepared paper,
and spread to your desired shape. I
like mine very thick with a chewy/
gooey core, but some people go
thin and crispy. Bake in the oven
for 1-2 hours, turning the oven
off as soon as the meringue begins
to colour. Don’t worry if it leaks a
small amount of sugar syrup. Turn
the oven off, and leave the meringue
to cool inside with the door open.
When completely cool, start
building the pavlova. Whip the
cream – add a touch of icing sugar
if you like, or maybe some fruit
puree – and spoon that over the
base. Top with the fresh fruit, and
maybe sprinkle some toasted flaked
almonds or white chocolate curls on
top. Devour.
