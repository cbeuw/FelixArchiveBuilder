it.This is compounded by the lack of
a definitive post-EU plan from any
of the main political parties/leaders,
chiefly because they’re all voting to
remain. What this means is that for
better or for worse, there’s very little
evidence to base decisions on.There
are, however, opinions and studies
aplenty with which you can use
to form your opinion, but nothing
should taken to be a hard and fast
rule.
The debate centres around a few
key arguments concerning areas
such as the economy, immigration
and security, and further issues
under these umbrellas.The economy
is arguably the most important of
these,with it being a case of whether
membership of the EU helps or
hurts UK trade deals as well as the
issue of sovereignty.
While it can be said that the EU
means countries are, in some cases,
locked into trade deals with large,
emerging markets such as China
and India (with whom we may have
gotten a better deal by negotiating
solo) the countries that the UK
does a substantial amount of trade
with are EU members. This means
barriers between us and them may,in
O
ver the course of the
last UK election period
and for the bulk of 2016
so far, the media and
news in general has been focussed
on the UK’s membership within
the European Union, but what’s
actually going on?
Where did the EU come from?
In essence the European Union
(EU) is a group of 28 countries who
all have one thing in common: they
all occupy a corner of the world and
have been bickering over who owns
which part for thousands of years,
often in quite bloody wars.
It took one big war (World War
II) to finally accept that enough
was enough and that some way of
stopping this from happening again
was needed. The EU was preceded
by two other unions, the European
Coal and Steel Community and the
European Economic Community,
as a way to tie countries together
economically, making them less
likely to declare war on each other,
something generally regarded as a
good thing.
It grew from just the founding six
countries in the 1950s (Belgium,
France, Italy, the Netherlands,
Luxembourg and West Germany)
adding over half a billion people
and 24 official languages to reach
its current membership levels. The
union, once seen as a stronghold
against communism, has n o w
expanded such that it
encapsulates many
of the former
“Eastern Bloc”
countries, and almost the entirety of
Europe with the notable exceptions
of Switzerland, Iceland and
Norway. Many countries such as
Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro,
Serbia and Turkey have applied for
membership and are in the process
of being considered.
And what does the EU do?
The countries within the EU
pay membership fees, vote on laws
in the European Parliament and
citizens of these countries are part
of the EU as a whole. This means
that these citizens can live,work and
retire in any other EU country, and
can move freely from one country to
another thanks to a treaty known as
the Schengen Agreement.
Naturally, the countries also have
to follow the laws set out by the
EU’s parliament (for better or for
worse) and comply with the various
trade agreements, sanctions and
levies imposed.
This union is also taken further
in 19 of the 28 member states, who
participate in the Eurozone and are
linked by a single currency.They can’t
decide their own monetary policies
individually but the system as a
whole allows for lower transaction
costs and greater price transparency
between member nations.
And what’s the referendum?
On June 23rd
the UK is having a
referendum to decide whether to
stay in the EU or leave, in a sort of
political hokey-cokey (except that
once we’re in or out it’ll likely be for
a while). If you’re over 18 and are:
a British citizen living in the UK, a
British citizen living abroad for less
than 15 years, an EU citizen
resident in the
U K
( a s
long
as you only vote
in European elections in the
UK) or a Republic of Ireland
or Commonwealth citizen
(this also includes the 2
EU member states of
Malta and Cyprus)
and are resident in
the UK, then you’re
eligible to vote as long
as you register before June the
7th.
Tough luck if you’re any other
nationality, as even if you’re a long-
term UK resident and UK taxpayer,
you don’t get a vote.
From there just a simple majority
is needed by one side, with no
minimum turnout required.
So who’s on which side?
The debate has captured the full
support of some political parties
and has divided others, with the
wider public split too. The SNP
and Lib Dems have all
their MPs supporting the
Remain campaign as well
as almost all Labour MPs,
whereas around 130 of the 330
Conservative MPs are backing the
Leave campaign, despite David
Cameron throwing all his weight
behind staying in the EU.
Notable dissension within the
Conservative ranks has come from
Boris Johnson (former Mayor of
London) and Michael Gove (the
current Justice Secretary). Jeremy
Corbyn, once a staunch EU critic
has now come out in favour of
remaining, although the jury is
still out as to how sincere this was.
Obama also voiced his anti-Brexit
stance when he was in Britain last
month, while Donald Trump is
unsurprisingly anti-EU. Joey Essex
has yet to cast his opinion on the
issue, although he is currently
filming a TV show which tackles
the referendum, so keep your eyes
peeled for that...
So, the debate
Both sides have been flinging
statistics and counter-statistics at
each other, with a huge amount of
confusion ensuing. In essence, as
withmanythingsinlife,therearefew
certainties and there is a risk in both
staying in the EU, as well as leaving

An idiot’s guide to the EU referendum
Should we stay or should we go?
Joey Essex
has yet to
cast his
opinion on
the issue
the short term at least, hinder trade
post-Brexit. The IMF, World Bank
and OECD have issued reports
advising against the UK leaving
the EU, but Brexit supporters urge
that on its own two feet the UK will
have more autonomy to spend its
taxes and implement its subsidies as
it sees fit, in ways more suited to the
needs of the British economy.
Uncertainty about the economy
post-Brexit may cause companies
to either reduce investment in the
UK or take their business elsewhere
entirely but,if the UK did eventually
become stronger on its own the
opposite could happen, with more
companies choosing to expand their
businesses into the UK rather than
other EU member states.
The issue of the EU’s growing
power, not only over policies and
law, but to the point of the control
of the fiscal policy of each and
every country is a scenario touted
by anti-EU campaigners. This
scenario would be tricky without a
full currency union, but the UK will
always be more on the fringe of the
EU if it doesn’t change to the euro
from the pound. This would likely
be met with great hostility since the
Eurozone crisis was a large factor
in the recent global recession, and
was blamed for the high levels of
youth unemployment in Greece and
Spain.
Furthermore, the Leave campaign
say that should the UK leave the
EU, trade with European countries
would still continue; they rely on
trade with us as much as we rely
on trade with them. This supposes
a scenario in which the UK gets
seemingly all the benefits of trade
with the EU without having to
pay membership fees. This is not
an impossible series of events but
if other countries see this they’re
likely to feel cheated, leading to
either them shunning the UK or
opting out themselves. A domino
effect of countries leaving could lead
to the collapse of the EU, making
trade deals a lot harder should
these countries revert back to their
plethora of original currencies.
Some non-EU members are
instead part of the European
Economic Area (EEA) such as
Norway, Iceland and Switzerland
(kinda) and are not subject to all
the membership fees and all the
regulations of the EU. This leads to
slightly more freedom but no seat at
the EU table deciding the laws that
they nevertheless have to follow. In
some cases this has worked for them,
but we are a much bigger economy
and one which relies on sectors
other than fishing, the Northern
Lights and Roger Federer, meaning
it might not work out for us or it
might work out even better still.
The issue surrounding security is
one that is often screamed about,
with both sides arguing that we
would simultaneously be safer in
and out of the EU. The sharing of
information within the EU has
been made easier by cooperation
between nations, but the former
head of MI6 feels that security
would increase should the UK
leave. This is based on allowing us
to drop the European Convention
on Human Rights (to allow us
to deport criminals such as Abu
Hamza), share information more
freely with non-EU countries, as
well as strengthen our borders
from movement of terrorists
that reside within the EU. The
Convention on Human Rights
is usually seen as a good thing on
the whole though, and this would
be unlikely to be dropped (I mean
Britain did draft the original rights
in the first place).
The counterargument on our
borders does have a bit of a twist
too, with the 20 miles of English
We rely on

Channel making the UK different
from full Schengen (free movement)
members. This extends into a treaty
with France known as“LeTouquet”,
in which the British border is
(kinda) in France, something that
may or may not disappear if we left
the EU. This leads to a situation in
which refugees could claim asylum
in Britain as currently they have to
actually step foot on the mainland
to do so. Whether we should be
allowing more refugees in is a whole
other kettle of fish.
Other more pressing issues are
present too, as the UK is likely to
be pretty disliked at Eurovision
should we leave, although we can’t
really slip down the rankings much
further anyway.
This is by no means anywhere close
to being exhaustive on the debate,
you need to go and research the
aspects that are most important to
you. One topic that might be close
to home is the scientific community
within Europe. Pulling out of this
might constrict the opportunities
you have to work abroad and make
cross border research harder to
complete or it may deregulate and
kickstart your industry.
If you want an opinion on
whether Brexit would be a good
or bad move, your professional
institute might be a good place to
start. Imperial students have also
set up two opposing campaigns,
the pro-EU ICL Students 4 EU
and the pro-Brexit Students for
Britain, which can be found on
Twitter at @Imperial4EU and
@SfBImperial respectively.
What else is going on
though?
The debate cannot be taken as
an isolated issue, and other global
political and economic issues
undoubtedly cross over into the pros
and cons of the EU referendum.
One of the most prevalent of these
has been the ongoing refugee crisis,
with immigration a key point
being argued by
the leave
camp.
The
arguments presented above may
help or hinder this problem but
there is a case to be made that the
migrant issue is bigger than just the
economic elements it presents and
is instead an issue of morality.
The arguments around
immigration and security also
stretch into the recent terrorist
attacks in mainland Europe,
bringing the potential pitfalls of the
Schengen Zone and the successes
of cross border agencies such as
Europol to the forefront of media
coverage.
The recent referendum in Scotland
has stirred up independence talks
and the SNP have promised
another referendum should the
U K as a whole vote to leave
the EU
yet Scotland vote to remain. A
similar promise has been touted
in Northern Ireland, with the
added complication of the Irish
reunification debate. With the
border between Northern Ireland
and the Republic of Ireland being
the only mainland border the UK
shares with the EU (putting the
complex situation in Gibraltar
aside) there are questions as to
whether a ‘hard’ border would have
to be imposed, a situation that
would likely inflame relations in
Ireland, a place only recently free of
The Troubles.
The internal politics within the
Conservative Party is another factor
at play, as David Cameron has said
he won’t serve a third term as PM,
leaving the door open for a new
leader, who could potentially be
decided by the referendum. Front
runners George Osborne and Boris
Johnson are on opposite sides of the
argument, with the “winner” likely
to get a boost in the leadership race.
The upcoming election in the
US may also have ripples this side
of the pond too, as if, God forbid,
Donald Trump were to clinch the
presidency we might be negotiating
in a very different world of politics.
He’s pro-Brexit but who knows
how much UK trade would feature
in making America great again (I
mean the current Secretary of State
for Business and London Mayor are
both of Muslim heritage and may
not be willing or even able to enter
the US under Trump’s proposals).
Why should I vote?
Whatever happens this is going
to have effects on your everyday life,
so shine your crystal balls, weigh up
the risks and benefits of both sides,
come to a decision and then for the
love of God, vote. It’s your future.
And if you don’t vote the elderly
will, and they’ll be dead soon.
