FILM
The top three
Japanese Films
that aren’t
Animated
T
wo weeks ago I slagged
off the French film-
making philosophy. In
an effort to be more
positive this week, I’m going
to heap praise on my favourite
film-producing country – Japan.
Looking past the endlessly
churned out anime crap,animated
Japanese cinema may very well be
the best in the world. – Miyazaki,
Katsuhiro Ôtomo and Mamoru
Hosoda are unmatched in the
eyes of many critics. But it would
be nice for live action films get a
look in:
Tokyo Sonata (2008)
When reviewing the French
‘style’of filmmaking I commented
on its annoying fascination with
endless dialogue and rich young
people’s tiresome love lives. No
film shows off the vastly superior
Japanese filmmaking philosophy
as Tokyo Sonata. Much like a
modern-day Tokyo Story, the film
is a classic Japanese slice-of-life
drama focused on family and
appreciating small things in life.
13 Assassins (2010)
Much like Tokyo Sonata is a
modern-day, version of the classic
Tokyo Story,13 Assassins represents
a new-and-improved version of
Seven Samurai. It tells the classic
story of an elite team taking on
hordes of bad-guys threatening
a poor village, with everything
ramped up to 11. Seven Samurai
may be the critic’s favourite but
never try to challenge Takeshii
Mike on violent spectacle.
Departures (2008)
I’m surprised that I’ve never
spoken about Departures before.
The problem is that it’s hard to
describe it in a way that does
justice to how beautiful and life
affirming it is. It tells of a newly
unemployed cellist who takes
up a job preparing the dead
for their funerals. The film is
hugely intelligent and uniquely
emotional. It explores the topics
of death, family, and Japanese
sensibilities better than any other
film I have ever seen.
BEN COLLIER
Documentary corner: King of Kong
Ben Collier
Writer
A
s this will be my last
Documentary Corner
feature of the year, I
thought it fitting to end
on a high note, with my favourite
documentary of all time – King
of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters. It
works in every way a documentary
should, and then some. Director
Seth Gordon was able to create
a suspenseful, exciting, and
completely engrossing film about
one of the strangest and most niche
topics imaginable – competitive
Donkey Kong.
As I said in one of the older
editions of documentary corner, a
good documentary can take a topic
you love and make it exciting and
interesting, but a great documentary
should be able to get the same
reaction for a topic you know
nothing about.King of Kong is about
two men competing for the Donkey
Kong world-record high score.
Since it came out, a lot of people
have taken to simply referring to it
as ‘Billy vs Steve’ because of its two
main characters – Billy Mitchell
and Steve Wiebe.
The director has a lot of fun with
classic Hollywood archetypes when
showing us the two men: Mitchell
is an icon in the world of arcade
gaming, holding countless world
records and has an ego to match.
Wiebe is an outsider to this culture
– an incredibly humble and likeable
guy, who is intimidated and picked
on by Mitchell and his goons at
every turn as he tries to achieve the
first truly extraordinary thing in his
life. This underdog story really does
boil down to a classic tale of good vs
evil, and it’s handled perfectly.
There is bundles of style to be
found here. A fine line is walked
between silliness and seriousness,
between drama, action, and comedy.
The editing and style of filming also
lends a great retro feel to each scene.
The documentary is aware of the
eccentricities of the topic and has
fun with it – because of this, the
audience is also able to have fun too.
Overall, however, it is the story
that drives everything. At points
one begins to question if Mitchell
is even a real person: he’s so
deliciously evil he even looks like
a cheesy Hollywood villain – think
Ben Stiller in Dodgeball. If it weren’t
for the genuine sincerity of it all,
one might mistake King of Kong as
a mockumentary, but at the end of
the day, despite some silliness, the
story of Steve Wiebe is an inspiring
one. Having such a genuine and
easy-to-root-for protagonist cuts
through a lot of the humour to give
a touching heart to a truly unique
and wonderful project. Originally,
the film was supposed to be about
retro gaming culture as a whole (we
see a little bit of this with small
features on other world champions
like ‘Roy Awesome’), but the
narrative Mitchell and Wiebe gave
the producers was just too good to
ignore. As such, the story unfolded
throughout filming, and we get to
experience the narrative progress
just as the filmmakers did. And
what a narrative it is.

Florence Foster Jenkins and the
cinematic allure of musical enigmas
L
ast week saw the release
of Florence Foster Jenkins,
a biopic based on the life
one of the worst singers of
all time – Florence Foster Jenkins
was widely regarded as a completely
hopeless singer, a fact she didn’t
let get in the way of attempting to
forge a musical career. Recordings
from the time betray a complete
lack of pitch, rhythm, intonation,
and tone – a fact that may have been
linked to a syphilis-linked decay of
her central nervous system. Cheery!
While the Stephen Frears-directed
film, starring Meryl Streep, may
have been welcomed with more
praise than Jenkin’s singing voice,
she’s not the only outsider musician
out there who deserves to have a
film made about her. Here are four
more left-field performers who
deserve a movie of their own:
Big Edie
Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale,
otherwise known as ‘Big Edie’,
may have already had a film
made about her – in the form of
Albert and David Maysles’ 1975
documentary Grey Gardens, which
charts the destructive and isolating
relationship between her and her
daughter, ‘Little Edie’ – but such a
large character deserves a film all of
her own. Beale, the aunt of Jackie
Kennedy, used to be an amateur
singer, before she ensconced herself
in her dilapidated mansion, and
fell into poverty. Grey Gardens is a
disturbing,twisted film,in which the
destitution of the main characters
is only enlivened by Little Edie’s
frequent quotable lines – ‘I only
care about three things: dancing,
swimming, and the Catholic church
– and Big Edie breaking out into
song. In her late 70s when the
film came out, Big Edie’s voice is
as strong as ever, belying an early
talent. A film looking at her early
life would be a fantastic companion
piece to Grey Gardens.
The Space Lady
Moving on, The Space Lady, a
paradigm of the outsider music
movement,spent much of the 1970s
and 80s singing melancholic covers
of popular songs on the streets of
Boston and San Francisco. Initially
accompanied by an accordion, she
later made the switch to a Casio
synthesiser keyboard, which gave
her songs a cosmic edge; despite the
limitations of the synthesiser, which
only has six rhythm patterns,
she managed to convert an
astonishing range of music
into her unique vision.
Retiring in 2000, many
commentators speculated about
her whereabouts, fuelled by online
bootlegs of her recordings. In 2012
she came out of retirement, the
resurgence in interest securing her a
record deal and a world tour. We all
love a redemption tale in film, and
the fact that she’s still performing
makes a documentary all the more
necessary.
Shin Jung-Hyun
All the best musicians fight
against ‘the man’, but South Korea’s
“Godfather of Rock”, Shin Jung-
Hyun went further than most.
Active in the 1960s and 70s, Shin
became known in Korea for his
psychedelic-tinged rock, which
drew on the influences introduced
by marines stationed at U.S. Army
bases. It drew the attention of
President Park Chung-Hee, who
asked Shin to write a song in praise
of the presidency – Shin refused,
and instead composed ‘Beautiful
Rivers and Mountains’, a song
that extolled the natural beauty of
Korea, and ironically took its name
from a line in the national
anthem. Needless to
say, President Park
didn’t take it well, and
Shin was tortured in
prison, before being
committed to a
psychiatric
hospital. As Korea explores its
recent history, with novelists like
Han Kang leading the charge, it’s
time a film was made about Shin,
and his daring refusal to conform.
Connie Converse
Finally, the saddest tale of the
bunch: Connie Converse moved
to New York City in the 1940s,
hoping to break it in the gestating
folk scene. While popular with
other musicians on the scene, for
whom Converse would perform,her
melancholic folk was never popular
with the public. Her songs a both
winsome and tragic, and Converse
was really ahead of her time – one
of the earliest singer-songwriters
in a world that would soon become
saturated with them. Following the
stratospheric success of Bob Dylan,
she left New York for Ann Arbor,
and then in 1974 she distributed
notes to her family and friends, and
set off in her Volkswagen Beetle for
a better life. She was never heard
from again. A documentary in the
style of Searching for Sugar Man,
looking for where Converse went,
would bring her beautiful folk to
light.
