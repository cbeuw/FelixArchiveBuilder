crux of perspectives
on justifications
for science and
technology. There’s the age-old idea
of fundamental research having
inherent, non-monetary value
as a social service - sort of like a
library, providing building blocks
of knowledge we can all draw from.
Increasingly, however scientists are
having to prove the financial value
and the return-on-investment
of their research in order to get
funding, much the way someone
getting a loan from a bank for, say, a
start-up cupcake stand does. When
you factor in the increasing amount
of time scientists have to spend
with their hats-in-hands writing
grants, submitting proposals, – an
incredible amount of our collective
scientific brain capacity is spent
thinking about how to acquire and
justify sources of funding from
drying wells. Skilled researchers and
their teams spend countless days,
months, even years pandering to
administrative managers who often
only see a chart of red lines that
need to be converted to black.Many
scientists claim upwards of 30% or
greater of their time is now taken
up simply finding funds. This also
disproportionately affects younger
researchers who can’t secure funding
based on their ‘brand’ the way more
established scientists can.
Whether we can blame recent
austerity measures, or reach further
back and point at shifts like the rise
of neoliberalism decades ago, we
should regardless be considering the
impact of having scientific research
funding tightly intertwined with
economic drivers and determinants.
Some fields or areas of science may
have obvious direct impacts that can

of financial value simply because of
their practical applications in the
economic market – say for instance,
the development of a new type of
rubber for tyres. But there is much
research that has less clear and
more indirect measurable economic
impact. How do you calculate the
return-on-investment for 30 years-
worth of data on water levels in the
Thames, or the discovery of a new
species of moth in the Amazon?
American physicist Richard
Feynman once argued that the three
primary values of science are: it
enables us to do and make all kinds
of things, it provides intellectual
enjoyment in doing and thinking
about it, and it teaches us to remain
unsure and in doubt. So how sure
are we that the pursuit of scientific
knowledge needs to be constantly
weighted against economic
measures?
Science, what’s good?

ut of 2,501 members
of the British public
recently surveyed by
scientists from Cardiff
University’s School of Psychology,
only twenty percent were aware
of ocean acidification. The study,
published in the Nature Climate
Change journal, is the first to assess
public understanding of the issue.
The study surveyed a representative
sample of Britain, which is
alarming. Dr Stuart Capstick says
that although they didn’t expect to
find high levels of public awareness,
the extent of obliviousness amongst
laymen was surprising. Things
become meta now; when subjects
became aware of the percentage of
unawareness there was a jump in
concern…which then subsided once
ocean acidification was connected
to climate change. Hm.

Scientists have developed and
tested a biofeedback system that
uses the plants’ physiological
performance to regulate lighting.
This new method may greatly
reduce the energy cost of LED
lighting, employed by controlled
environment agriculture facilities,
such as vertical farms. By measuring
chlorophyll production and putting
measurements through a datalogger,
they estimated the electron transport
rate, which is a photosynthesis
indicator. This allowed them to
determine exactly how much light
the plants needed and modulate
lighting accordingly. The datalogger
in turn altered the duty cycle of the
LED lighting source, optimizing
the process.The biofeedback system
can successfully maintain a wide
range of ETR (photosynthesis)
values in different species, as well as
take into consideration light to heat
conversions and chloroplast damage
when making efficiency decisions.

Inventing new materials with
desired properties could become
much faster and easier, using an
information-based adaptive design
strategy. As put by Turab Lookman,
one of the scientists behind the
new approach, “starting with a
relatively small data set of well-
controlled experiments,it is possible
to iteratively guide subsequent
experiments toward finding the
material with the desired target”.
The data-driven framework utilising

model developed by Lookman
and his team at Los Alamos and
the State Key Laboratory for
Mechanical Behaviour of Materials
in China had to narrow down its
pool of combinations to nickel-
titanium-based shape-memory
alloys for the sake of simplicity, the
system can be adapted to optimise
desired manufacturing applications
and properties.

Churning out
new materials
Remember when earlier last year
a paper came out highlighting a
star which seemed to be blocked
by a large number of irregular
objects, suggesting the presence of
alien megastructures? A number of
studies have since been published
for and against the Dyson sphere
argument, the latest showing that
prior evidence that proposed the
star had experienced a dimming
of twenty percent, was in fact a
result of fading of the photographic
glass plates that had been taken
by Harvard astronomers between
1885 and 1993. Still, even with
the twenty percent dimming taken
off the table, Tabby’s star remains
highly mysterious. There still is no
conclusive explanation as to why
the star’s light curve is anomalous.
Boyajian, the leading scientist
behind this latest study investigating
the mysterious star propose the
fragmentation of a large comet into
a swarm of smaller ones.

The role of a long non coding
RNA (lncRNA) sequence has been
identified as protecting the unborn
baby from invading pathogens.
The new study published in
Molecular and Cellular Biology, is
the first to identify a lncRNA in
the placenta involved in immune
system regulation. LncRNAs are
non protein-coding transcripts,
longer than 200 nucleotides,
involved in the regulation of gene
expression. The study looked
through existing data to identify
molecules present at trophectoderm
cells which give rise to the placenta,
zeroing in on lncRHOXF1. After
characterisation, in vitro modelling
and identification of the location of
its expression, they observed that
altering expression levels, impacted
expression of viral RNA, after
infecting lncRHOXF1 blocked
cells with Sendai virus. The team is
interested in exploring applications
of their findings to Zika control.

launched a worldwide
campaign asking the
public to help combat
illegal wildlife trade. Despite efforts

it continues to grow. A recent
increase in poaching threatening
species has raised concerns about
the long-term survival of iconic
animals such as elephants and
rhinos.Shockingly,rhino horn today

Taronga Conservation Society in
Australia developed a smartphone
app called Wildlife Witness. It
allows the public to submit images
and data of suspicious items on

wildlife trade monitoring network.
Originally the app’s focus was South
East Asia, however Chester Zoo
aims at raising awareness across
Europe. San Diego Zoo will do

t Sh!t Sc!ence,
we like to defend
research that may
seem insignificant
or futile. We believe that all

complicated selection process
during which a group of learned
intellectuals congregate and
decide what particular pieces of

in order to bridge our gaps in
human knowledge. This week,

has an influence on the sleep cycle
of children. Regardless of whether
you’ve used the moon’s phases as
an excuse for your behaviour, there
is no scientific evidence to support
the idea that the full moon drive us
crazy,not even a little. That was until
a team of top scientists decided to
revisit this outdated notion.To avoid
any social,economic or geographical
biases, they recorded sleep patterns
of 5814 children, in twelve different
countries, spanning five continents,
for 28 months. This resulted in
a whopping 33,710 recordings
captured by accelerometers strapped
to the children’s chests for the whole
time.
By cross-referencing these
readings to the phase of the moon,
the scientists came to the following
staggering conclusion (drumroll
please): The full moon alters sleep
patterns in about 1% of cases. Lead
scientist Dr. Jean-Philippe Chaput,
from the Eastern Ontario Research
Institute said, “Overall, I think we
should not be worried about the full
moon. Our behaviours are largely
influenced by many other factors
like genes, education, income and
psychosocial aspects rather than
by gravitational forces.” Cue sad
pacman sound of defeat.
This rather anticlimactic result
does actually shed some light on
an important phenomenon. In
the recent years, there has been
increased attention to what is called
the circadian clock. This internal
‘clock’ regulates how our body
reacts at different times of the day,
regulating functions such as
hormone production, body
temperature and brain wave
activity. This clock reacts to
external cues such as exposure
to light and temperature, and
a more subtle understanding
of circadian rhythms has
allowed us, for instance, to
synchronise drug delivery with
the circadian clock and increase
drug efficiency and reduce
toxicity. As some animals have
been known to have an internal
clock which follows the lunar
cycle, it is not unreasonable
to evaluate whether humans
could be affected by the phases
of the moon, and this research
helps us close the door on that
possibility.
God dammit there’s a full moon again
