You really need to make sure that your bedroom door is locked
W
hen Palmer Luckey
kickstarted the
virtual reality
revolution in 2012
I doubt he expected that one of
primary uses of his new technology
would be pornography. We’ve seen
smartphones change the way we
watched porn, and VR is set to do
the same. While 3D porn itself
is nothing new (it’s been around
for decades), virtual reality porn
is significant in that it is able to
simulate physical presence via a
combination of head tracking and
stereoscopic vision. The porn set
is now all encompassing and you
become the porn star. No longer
merely the spectator, you are now a
spectre in another person’s body.
Porn sites have been quick to react
to the rise of virtual reality headsets,
with PornHub introducing a
virtual reality section on their
website earlier this year. Once an
inaccessible oddity, VR porn is now
available to everyone for free. So, I
guess I had to try it.
To transport yourself to another
world, first you have to leave your
own reality. Unfortunately, head
mounted displays completely
separateyoufromyoursurroundings,
so if you’ve ever been worried about
someone bursting in and catching
you in the act, VR porn probably
isn’t for you. Not only will you
look like some sort of futuristic
sex-addicted spaceman, but you
probably won’t even be aware when
someone does enter the room (and
that could be a little embarrassing).
Ignoring all the potential awkward
situations that might occur, virtual
reality porn is pretty rad.
It succeeds for a number of
reasons.Remember those gimmicky
in-your-face bits in 3D films? VR
porn directors have taken note, and
this new genre of adult film consists
entirely of scenes where you have
dicks and tits dangled in front of
your face. Probably more interesting
is how enclosing your face in a
headset makes everything feel far
more intimate than, say, watching
the same video on your phone or
computer. There’s no interactivity
(yet), so, it’s unlikely to replace sex
Virtual reality porn is a game-changer
anytime soon. In the meantime,
it opens up a whole new range of
experiences and experiments to us.
Virtual reality,from the beginning,
has been advertised as the ability
to experience something as if it
were reality or from someone else’s
perspective. In the past, I’d never
been curious enough to watch porn
aimed at the opposite sex. However,
there’s something incredibly
powerful about experiencing sex,
and presence, when the roles are
reversed. If there was ever a reason
to try VR porn this would be it.
For now, I expect virtual reality
porn will remain nothing more than
an intrigue. However, as technology
advances and display resolutions
increase, virtual reality has a good
chance at replacing conventional
pornography. And once it’s replaced
that, combine it with networking
technologies, sex toys, weird AI
sexbots and it might just replace sex
itself.

We’re all jealous of our friends at uni outside London
W
ith exams finishing
and the sun coming
out, Imperial is a
hive of frenzied
sexual activity, as inhibitions are
shed in anticipation of the long
summer break. But if you live in a
shared room in halls, it strongly
limits the privacy available for the
exciting sexual encounters that
we’re all craving. Some of you may
have already worked out how to get
around this, and for others this may
be a new problem. Anyway, here’s
some advice for you to make the
most of the rest of the summer term.
1. The scheduler
Most roommates are pretty
reasonable about giving you the
room for a few hours, providing
they’re not still revising while
you’re totally free. I’ve known
roommate pairs who’ve negotiated
alone time for sex, masturbation, or
even Skyping home, so depending
on your relationship with your
roommate, you don’t necessarily
need to be completely honest with
them. Of course, this requires a
degree of organisation from you and
your partner.
2. The inconsiderate
You could just go for it when
your roommate is out. Most people,
upon returning to their room and
finding their roommate having sex,
will back out and find something
else to do for a little while, even
if they are passive-aggressively
How to have sex in halls
messaging the kitchen whatsapp
group complaining about it. Unless
you like being walked in on, pre-
agreeing a warning signal is key,
even if it’s just a courtesy text or a
sock on the doorknob. If you do like
being walked in on, see tip number
three.
3. The spontaneous
There are plenty of semi-
private spaces, both in halls and
elsewhere on campus, that you
can sneak off too and enjoy each
other’s company. These vary from
essentially private (lockable rooms)
to risky (empty common rooms in
the middle of the night), and in
my experience, the acceptable level
of risk is proportional to the level
of horniness. A word of warning
though, particularly in halls, more
of the public spaces have CCTV
than you’d expect, and security may
well be watching you (Beit laundry
room, I’m looking at you).
4. The borrower
If you have particularly liberal
friends, you may find someone
willing to lend you their single room
if they,say,go away for the weekend.
You may have to withstand some
good-natured ribbing, offer up
bribes, Febreeze their room, and
hopefully launder their sheets, but
in exchange for that, you can enjoy
getting nasty in private.
5. The exhibitionist
Or you can just wait until your
roommate falls asleep and then go
at it. You have to be painfully quiet,
and they may wake up and be a
bit traumatised, but it’s probably
fair game – they’ve definitely
masturbated when you’ve been
asleep before.

What makes a good GUM clinic?
Getting tested can be a fun day out
Anonymous

A
pparently I engage in
risky sexual behaviour.
This means that like the
good millennial I am,
I have to periodically get tested to
make sure that I'm free from the
nasties that make sex a little less
fun and a little more infectious
(and not in a good way). Although
there are many sexual health
clinics in London, many of which
are excellent and come with rave
reviews (with a particular shout out
to the Dean Street Clinic in Soho),
my personal preference is Imperial
College's own Jefferiss Wing in St
Mary's Hospital.
One of the problems with walk-
in clinics is the unknown wait, but
the Jefferiss Wing offers you the
opportunity to book a slot via text,
although just walking in, I've never
waited an unreasonable amount of
time. And, from the moment you
walk in, to the moment you're seen,
you're kept pretty well updated on
how long you'll be waiting. To keep
you entertained, as well as college
networks, there's free wifi (although
YouTube is blocked, sadly).
Everything in this clinic is
completely anonymised. You're
asked to give your name and address
to the staff when you arrive, which
is exchanged for an anonymised
patient number that you'll be called
by (make sure that you remember
it, you'll want to have it if you
come back again). Although you
can theoretically lie about your
name and address, nothing is
transferred to your primary medical
records without your consent, and
the address dictates which local
authority they charge for the testing.
On arrival, you're asked whether
you're experiencing any symptoms,
need emergency treatments, or are
there for a check up, and based on
that you'll be put in line to see either
a doctor or a nurse. They also do
cervical smears while you're there, if
you've been too lazy to get around to
having one done with your regular
doctor.
I've never seen anyone at this
clinic, doctor or nurse, who wasn't
kind,friendly,and non-judgemental,
and who I didn't feel completely
comfortable with. You can tell that
the staff are genuinely passionate
about sexual health and disease
prevention, and that they want to
provide the best patient care.
They'll quiz you in detail on
your partners within the last three
months, and ask you some general
questions about longer term
risk factors. Regardless of your
designated risk level (I was placed
in the same risk group as men who
have sex with men for money,which
is almost an achievement), they're
incredibly thorough, and usually
offer a full barrage of tests even if
you've only had protected sex with
one person one time.
Alongside the usual tests and
treatments for chlamydia and
gonorrhoea, the Jefferiss Wing lets
you opt in for on the spot hepatitis
B vaccinations (as well as hepatitis
A, if you've been rimming gay men,
which I would recommend).There's
something incredibly reassuring
about being immune to an incurable
disease, so if given the option, you
should definitely opt in.
As well as taking blood for more
thorough testing, anyone worried
can also get immediate fingerprick
HIV testing, which is a fairly
unusual offer,but very helpful if,like
me, you become convinced that you
have every transmittable infection
the moment you enter the clinic.
Of course, this only tells you your
status up to three months ago, so it's
important to get this done regularly
if you're worried. Luckily, they have
a system where you can skip the
queues and pop to another clinic
upstairs for a quick pinprick test if
that's all you need.
I think sexual health clinics are
a bit of a social equaliser. From
the teenage girls giggling and
whispering amongst themselves, to
the suited and booted city banker
type, you see all sorts of people, all
there for the same reason – they
want to have safe sex. While most
people probably spend their time
waiting making up stories about
why each person is there, you'll find
that you completely forget all about
them the moment you leave.
And before you leave, don't forget
to take some free condoms. As well
as the generic Mates condoms (the
same ones available at the Union
Reception, if you need any), if you
ask nicely, they'll give you some
higher quality condoms, usually
either Durex or Skyn.
Within a week or so, you'll get
a text telling you either that your
results were all negative, or that you
need to call the clinic. They send
these results out as soon as they
have them from their in-house lab
– once my friend got hers back the
same day. When I'm waiting for
this text, I tend to get a bit paranoid
and make all sorts of declarations
about how I'd rather not know, if
only to spare this torture. However,
I enjoy talking about my sex life,
so evaluating my partners with
someone who is qualified to offer
advice is a good day out in my book.
Even if you don't, I think it is really
important to get checked regularly,
if not for your own health, then for
the safety of those you have sex with.
Oh, and you'll be pleased to know
that my last tests were totally clear.
If you ask
nicely,
they'll give
you some
