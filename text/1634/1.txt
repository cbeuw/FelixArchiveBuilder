Sigma cancels Summer Ball appearance
Imperial to spread medic
bursaries out across all six years
This comes a year after the survey that said 97% of
final year students were in the red
Y
esterday it was announced
that Imperial’s bursaries
for medics will be spread
out over all six years of
study instead of just the first four.
This is in a bid to ease the financial
hardship that notoriously occurs in
the final years of a medical degree.
Currently, medical students can
get up to £6000 per year of Imperial
bursary, but only during the first
four years of their degree. Now, that
same amount will be spread over
the whole six years. This will mean
students get less money per year,
but could help them manage their
money better over the first four
years, so they are better off in the
last two years of study. The change
will only affect students starting
their studies from this September.
Current students will still only get
funding over the first four years.

T
he DJ duo who were due
to play the ICU Summer
Ball have cancelled
and will be replaced
by DJ Fresh. Despite the fact that
a contract between the artist and
the union had already been signed,
Sigma told the union last week
that they would not be playing the
Summer Ball on the 18th
of June,
presumably because they’ve had a
better offer.
The union announced the
headliner via a video of past summer
balls on Thursday the 28th
of April.
Last week, however, sources close
to FELIX learnt that the band had
pulled out. This morning, the union
managed to secure DJ Fresh instead.
Tickets are already on sale, and
students have been buying them at
£37.50 a pop under the impression
that Sigma was playing for two
weeks now. The price will be hiked
to £42.50 on the 20th
of May.
According to Sigma’s Songkick
and Seetickets pages, the band
haven’t ditched us for any festivals.
They’re playing both the Isle of
Wight festival and The Parklife
Weekender in Manchester the
weekend before the Summer Ball,
but then they have a gap before they
play Ibiza rocks on the 24th
of June.
Sigma have had two number
ones: ‘Nobody to love’ in 2014, and
‘Changing’ with Paloma Faith in
the same year.The duo met at Leeds
University before signing to DJ
Fresh’s record label in London.
DJ Fresh is most famous for his
number ones, ‘Louder’ and ‘Hot
Right Now’ with Rita Ora, released
in 2011 and 2012 respectively.
These days, DJ Fresh’s tour
schedule is decidedly less packed.
He played Aberystwyth University’s
Summer Ball on Sunday.
