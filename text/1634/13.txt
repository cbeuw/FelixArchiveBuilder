A
nother week, another
load of dead characters.
We start off where we
left last time with Jon
Snow wondering what the hell just
happened after being stabbed in
the heart, Melisandre wondering
how on Earth she just did that and
Davos trying to remember how he
got involved in this storyline in the
first place. Jon then puts some pants
on to talk to the Night’s Watchmen
and Wildlings that had gathered to
see him. He doesn’t end up saying
much and it’s not even 5 minutes
back in the realm of the living before
Tormund says he’s got a small dick.
Jon seems to have a thing about
getting insulted by gingers.
We then return to Sam and Gilly
on their first family cruise together
where she finds out they’re staying
with his parents while Sam goes
to college. Always an awkward
situation meeting the boy’s family.
The most interesting scene of
the episode was the flashback with
Bran,this time back to Ned fighting
Arthur Dayne at the Tower of
Joy. It’s pretty obvious what this
is leading up to but if anyone’s
not caught it yet I won’t spoil. I’m
definitely looking forward to this
revelation though.
Dany’s not having the best time,
turns out the Dothraki are about
as keen on feminism as Redditors
are, so they weren’t too happy with
Back to King’s Landing and
Qyburn is giving orphaned kids
sweeties so that they’ll talk to him.
It’s actually one of the least creepy
things about him in all honestly.
Cersei and Jamie then storm down
to his basement lair with their giant
zombie friend to chat about Cersei’s
oncoming trial by combat and how
her being paraded naked down the
streets has in no way mellowed
her out. Incesty Team Rocket then
marches up to the Small Council
chambers before being told that no
one wants to sit on their lunch table
so they’re left alone again.
Li’l’ King Tommen then heads
down to the prison to ask the High
Sparrow (AKA Birdie Sanders) for
his wifey and his mummy back.
Sanders then sits the boy down
to talk about why the gods think
his wife’s a hoe and his mum’s a
dickhead. Tommen seems fairly
convinced by his arguments.
Back to Braavos and we find Arya
playing a game of Lie and Get
Slapped (essentially the Braavosi
version of Jeremy Kyle). She gives
away her personal information like
she’s being audited by the Church of
Scientology until sexy Yoda decides
to give her vision back.
We then return to the North
where Ramsay is struggling to fill
Daddy’s boots. He’s attempting to
keep a member of House Umber
under control that’s repeatedly
calling him a prick to his face. It
looked like this guy’s head was
about to roll before revealing he
had Rickon Stark and Osha with
him, two characters last seen in
the season 3 finale. They are really
quite what yet.
We finish, back where we started,
at the Wall where Jon is having a
nice public execution to celebrate
his rebirth. Sergeant Douchebag
insists on getting a last few words
in before he gets done in whereas
everyone’s least favourite teenager
Olly instead opts for just scowling
at Jon like he just got sent to his
room. After this short interlude,
Jon drops the bomb of deciding to
leave the Night’s Watch, apparently
citing some of the fine print in the
oath that says if you get murdered
by a bunch of arseholes you can do
whatever you like.
Overall, I’d say this was a pretty
solid episode. The story really is
going full speed ahead this year,
possibly a results of the 7 season
timeline. There’s still the odd bit
of exposition dumping and clunky
dialogue that tends to come
with D&D writing an episode
themselves, but it’s not bad enough
to take away from the scale of the
events. If I had one complaint it’s
that this episode seems a little
rushed, there’s not been much room
for decent character development
this season between all the big
moments and the emotional impact
of the show has been suffering
because of it.

S
pinning out of the CW’s
live action DC shows is an
animated one by the name
of Vixen. This series takes
place in its own corner of the called
‘Arrowverse’, offering a take on a
different kind of hero, as well as
using animation to do the things
too expensive for live action. This
venture is mostly successful but not
without its faults.
The biggest thing the series has
against it is the fact that it’s so short.
Despite being 6 episodes long, the
entirety of season 1 adds up to a total
of around 30 minutes. As a result of
this, we get a story that, while being
good and entertaining, feels rushed
at times.The villains suffer the most
from this treatment, not being given
enough motivation as well as having
their defeat and aftermath largely
glossed over.
Still, there’s plenty to like here.
We see the story of Mari McCabe
who’s trying to work out the secret
of her past. The fact that she’s a
black woman helps to bring more
diversity to the set of mainstream
superheroes. The show details her
evolution from confused fashion
designer to someone embracing her
roots and becoming the hero she’s
destined to be. It’s a fairly simple,
tried and tested formula but one
Mari and her supporting characters
Still, Vixen has more ups than
downs and is a welcome addition to
the slew of comic-book adaptations.
With season one only being around
half an hour long,this is a series that
can be easily watched and might
provide some welcome relief from
all the revision.

wonder if there’s any point to their
appearances. They don’t really serve
the story in any way and are more or
less glorified cameos, reminding us
that these are the heroes who share
the same universe as Vixen. It’s
more frustrating given the fact that
with fewer time on these heroes, we
could have had more time expanding
on and developing Mari’s story. The
voice acting on the guest stars also
feels a little stiff, in stark contrast to

It’s the new
characters
who ride
roughshod
over this
season
which nonetheless makes for an
engaging and entertaining story.
The tone of the show is just right,
making it feel like its own thing
while not being bogged down by
the limitations of its sister shows.
The animation is top notch and
the action sequences are well-
done. They successfully portray the
power of having the abilities of
any animal you can choose, which
would be tricky, if not expensive, to
continuously render in live action. It
makes one hope that the CW would
try this experiment again in the long
run, and hopefully introduce more
heroes with more bizarre powers.
The Flash and Arrow also show up,
though in a way which makes one

this point, I mean come on! When

B
lood once again soaks the
streets of Hell’s Kitchen,
New York as Daredevil
returns to our computer
screens. Whereas the first season
detailed the rise of Matt Murdock
to the role of red-horn-wearing
superhero, this season focuses more
on Matt’s struggles with his new
role and with just what it means to
be a hero.
While the cast from the previous
season all return with performances
just as good as last time’s,it’s the new
characters who ride roughshod over
this season. Jon Bernthal’s Punisher
and Élodie Yung’s Elektra threaten
to steal the show,and in a few places
do just that.The Punisher is such an
avatar of on-screen power that the
episodes in which he does feature
often feel more like Punisher
Season 1 than Daredevil 2; a power
which I greatly hope he keeps when
Punisher Season 1 actually lands
later this year.
In contrast to Jon Bernthal’s
unhinged fury and despair,
Élodie Yung brings a more
refined psychopathy to the table,
a character with minimal morals
and no compunctions about acting
for her own goals. While Elektra’s
backstory is significantly changed
from the comics, going from a
woman who finds solace in murder
to one cut straight from sociopathic
cloth, this by no means detracts
from Yung’s fantastic performance.
Although she will likely not win
over as many fans as the Punisher,
hers is still a character done well, a
female character who acknowledges
her sexuality without being defined
entirely by it.
It is these two characters who
launch a two-pronged attack on
Daredevil’s conscience, on the one
hand a man who believes that Matt
hasn’t gone far enough,a man whose
philosophy on crime-fighting is best
summed up in his own words, “You
hit them and they get back up, I hit
them and they stay down”. On the
other hand a woman who represents
freedom from the moral code that
binds and defines Matt, a temptress
in both the mental and sexual way.
Despite the not-infrequent, and
certainly well done fight scenes, it’s
these philosophical battles which
makes this season of Daredevil stand
out to me. The battle between the
lawyer and the vigilante, between
restraint and necessity, between the
man of God and freedom, those are
the fights that make this season so
great.

The story
really is
going full
speed
ahead this
year
her roaming around, being a strong
independent woman who don’t
need no Khal. So they decide she’s
either dead or going to stay in their
retirement home forever.
Tyrion’s remains awkward as hell
trying to fit in at Meereen with
Dany’s advisors before Varys comes
in to pick up the conversation with
some juicy goss about the nearby
cities plotting against them. Maybe
something interesting will happen
in Meereen after all!
