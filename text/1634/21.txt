Imperial College Chess Congress
T
he UK has historically
been a chess friendly
place and with one of
the stops of the million-
dollar-plus Grand Chess Tour now
on our doorstep each December at
Olympia’s London Chess Classic,
the profile of chess is becoming
stronger in recent times.
Imperial College boasts a proud
history of playing host to chess
events throughout the 80’s and 90’s,
looking out towards the Queen’s
Tower from where the current JCR
and SCR sit. Due to the organisers
leaving Imperial and difficulties
with finding room, however, this
then fell by the wayside.
This was revived in 2011 when
the chess club and alumni joined
forces with Imperial College Union
to host the first congress in over a
decade in the shadow of the Royal
Albert Hall. The increase in interest
for events in London coupled with
the fantastic location cemented
the congress as a fixture in player’s
calendars – and 2016 marks the
fifth time the congress has been put
on since then!
Just under 100 players were
gathered throughout the last
weekend of April in the Union
Dining Hall for three days of play.
Some flew in for the event from
abroad including from the United
20…Bb4? [The decisive mistake]
[necessary was 20...Bxb5 21.Bxb5+ Qxb5 22.Qxa3 with an evenly balanced
game]
21.Rxd7! Rh7 [the rook cannot be taken 21...Kxd7 22.Qxf7+ Be7 23.Rd1+ and
Black must lose his Queen or be mated after 23...Kc6 24.Qxe6+ Kc5 25.Qc4#]
22.Qd3 Rc6 23.Rd1 axb5 [This leads to mate but Black’s position was already
hopeless]
24.Rd8+! Ke7 25.Qd7+ Kf6 26.Rf1+ Kg6 27.Rg8+ Kh6 [or 27...Rg7 28.Qxf7+! Kh6
29.Qxg7#]
28.Rf6# [A fitting finish to a fine attacking display from White.]
1–0
States, which is a great testament
to IC Union’s strong reputation for
providing an excellent environment
to play in.
The leading contender in the Open
section was FIDE Master Terry
Chapman of England, although
competition was fierce as eleven
players rated within 200 ELO
points of each other were bunched
up at the top. In the Major (rated
under 2000) section Ray Morris-
Hill, who won the section at the
previous event, again led the field
and Imperial College alumni (and
ex-chess club president) Nikunj
Sinha headed the list of entrants in
the Minor section.
Due to how tight the competition
was in all sections, it perhaps wasn’t
surprising to see the emergence of
someone slightly further down the
entry list as an early contender.
Alistair Hill took a clear half-point
lead after Saturday’s games with
FM Terry Chapman on his heels.
Scotland’s CM Paul Roberts, also
one of the highest rated players in
the tournament, fell a full point
behind at this point and had a
big uphill battle on the Sunday to
achieve the top positions.
The Major showed some more
of the usual suspects who perform
consistently well throughout the
year in London’s local leagues
(Imperial College Chess Club
participates in these, so if you are
a player yourself and fancy some
competitive games, do get in touch
with us). Charles McAleenan faced
off against Ray Morris-Hill in what
could have decided the sole lead
heading into Sunday but fought out
to a draw, allowing Oliver Finnegan
to take the overall lead by half a
point courtesy of his win over Peter
Wood.
In the Minor, Imperial alumnus
Nikunj started round three on
second board, half a point behind
the two leaders who actually
represented two thirds of the non-
Englishplayersinthesection!Italian
Domenico Amabile successfully
won with black against Cledwyn
Davies of Wales to set himself up
with a sole half-point lead that he
would not relinquish, allowing him
to win the Minor outright.
Oliver Finnegan showed class to
power through the Major and win
with only a single draw and four
wins,putting him in clear first place.
As a testament to the competition,
2nd
place had seven people sharing, a
full point behind on 3.5/5 with Ray
Morris-Hill leading the pack but
unable to catch.Finally,in the Open
section, Terry Chapman fought an
amazingly spirited game in the final
round to defeat Valentin Gaudeau
with the black pieces, and ensure
he clawed back the deficit to early
leader Alistair Hill. This guaranteed
both of them a share of 1st
after
Alistair’s final round draw against
Steven Jones.

the congress we can reproduce

Jacques Tivillier and Chino

and professional chess coach and
commentator Thomas Rendle.
We look forward to hosting the
congress again when time allows,
and are already planning the
next one. If you’re interested in
participating or you play chess and
would like to check out the club, we
welcome you with open arms and
are always looking for new players!
We meet every week on campus
(location next year TBC) and you
can get in touch by e-mailing chess@
imperial.ac.uk.
Many thanks to Appy Deshpande
& Bob Yung from IC Chess who
kept things well oiled with the
organising team all weekend, as
well as James Lindsay & Darya
Shirobokova of ICU without whom
the event couldn’t exist at our
wonderful venue.
