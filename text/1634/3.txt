Student’s political dreams shattered
He obviously wasn’t going to win standing for Labour in Kensington
A
n Imperial student with
dreams of becoming a
councillor was beaten
by two Conservative
candidates to join Kensington and
Chelsea council.
The winners were Sarah Ann
Louise Addenbrooke and Anne
Barbara Cyron, who gained 1716
and 1470 votes respectively.
The final year physics student
did come in at a noble third
place though, getting 395 votes;
a hundred more than the other
Labour candidate.
The vote took place alongside the
mayoral and London Assembly
elections last Thursday, after the
two Conservative council members
decided to step down, triggering a
by-election.
The Kensington and Chelsea
turnout was a sad 46.4%.

L
incoln students have voted
to leave the NUS, making
them the first to disaffiliate
from the nationwide
students’ union since controversial
new leader, Malia Bouattia, was
elected last month.
The vote lasted a week but turnout
was a measly 12%,with the out camp
only winning by 77 votes. Quorum
for Lincoln SU referendums is
only 10%, so the union can now
constitutionally leave the NUS.
Their subscription fees to NUS
that year had been in the region
of £44,000 plus £11,500 spend
on travel, accommodation and
attendance at the organisation’s
conferences. Considering Lincoln’s
student numbers, their subscription
fee was predicted to go up by £5000
for this coming year, and again the
year after.

Lincoln SU has decided to leave after the annual conference left their delegates
‘disillusioned’
Lincoln’s SU President said “the
focus of debate within the NUS
has been far removed from the
issues that our students tell us are
important”.
They will officially leave on the
last day of 2016.
Other universities, including
Exeter, York, Bath, Manchester,
Oxford and Cambridge have vocal
students campaigning for an ‘NUS-
xit’.
Next year’s Imperial College
Union Deputy President (Welfare),
Emily-Jane Cramphorn, said in
her manifesto that she aimed to
hold a referendum on re-joining
the NUS. So Imperial may well get
the opportunity to get back in with
the union, despite having left it six
times since becoming a founding
member in 1922.

Medics’
Imperial
bursaries to be
spread out
continued from front page
The financial pressure on fifth and
sixth year medics came to light last
year in an ICSMSU survey.
It found that 87% of these
students had financial concerns,
half had a part-time job to support
themselves, and one in three
said their parents were unable or
unwilling to offer financial help.
In the final two years of the degree,
medical students’ maintenance
loans are also reduced, and the
future of these payments is unclear.
ICU’s Deputy President
(Welfare), Jennie Watson, who is
also a medic, told FELIX: “These
changes will help a huge number of
medical students in the future but
there is still plenty to be done.”
“The Faculty of Medicine and
ICSMSU are working on ways to
support current students not eligible
for the Bursary Spread scheme as
they head towards years 5 and 6”.
