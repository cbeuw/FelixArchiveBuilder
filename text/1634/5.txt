The Bury Your Gays trope needs to die
LGBT fans deserve, and are demanding better from TV networks and producers

T
he 100 is a cult teen
drama focused on post-
apocalyptic America.
It has a significant,
primarily American following
who mobilised quickly following
the airing of an episode on the 3rd
March to launch an enormous
online campaign. During the
show, a character is shot as part
of the story arc that is directly
linked to her finally acting on
her feelings and kissing another
female character. This exploitation
– the ‘Bury Your Gays’ TV trope
– understandably did not sit well
with fans of the show, leading to the
hashtag #LGBTFansDeserveBetter
trending for seven hours, with over
300,000 tweets written immediately
after the show aired. The nature
of this campaign is that it has
long progressed from a complaint
about a character being killed off
on one show, and is now about
challenging the industry for overall
representation.
An adult
male
believed
that the
way she
was loving
someone
was wrong
Now, obviously characters die in
shows. It’s incredibly rare that a
show could run for a whole series
or more without killing a main or
recurring character, whether due
to contractual issues or a necessary
ending to a story arc. That said,
LGBT representation on TV has
a rocky history, and playing in to
harmful and toxic tropes is not a
good way to handle a necessary
death, so that your actor can leave
the show.
A large part of the response from
the network and the show has been
to tell us that Lexa,the character that
was shot, was not killed off because
she was a lesbian. However the fact
remains that she died because an
adult male believed that the way
she was loving someone was wrong.
Ignorance of the issue within the
industry in which you work, where
writing and background research
is literally what you are paid for, is
absolutely not a valid excuse. If you
don’t want to engage in the real-
world politics of a lesbian character,
LGBT
viewers
deserve to
see happy
futures
then do not write one whose primary
emotional arc is whether her love is
right or wrong and then kill her for
it. If they truly didn’t mean to strike
a political or personal nerve, they
sure fucked up.
Underrepresented groups
are continually denied positive
portrayals, making it harder to
visualize a positive outcome for
their own future. When death and
despair are the only features of the
lives you regularly see for characters
that reflect you, it rapidly becomes
damaging. It’s no secret that the
rate of suicide is considerably
higher in the LGBT community
than national averages, with a
2011 study by the CDC finding
LGBT youth four times more
likely to attempt suicide than their
straight peers. Isn’t it about time we
stopped normalizing this narrative
of no happy endings in mainstream
media? LGBT viewers deserve to
see happy futures reflected in easily
accessible media.
LGBT representation in all
forms never got off to a good start;
many of the first modern media
depictions came from the 1930s
where intense social control existed.
It was not a good time for the media:
regulations like the Hays Code
existed that forbade the depiction of
mixed-race relationships, amongst
others. In this environment, LGBT
representation of any kind was only
allowed under the premise that
LGBT characters were immoral by
dint of being LGBT and as such
could not be allowed to be happy in
said ‘immorality’. LGBT characters
could only exist if their storyline was
to be punished, and this manifested
primarily as the characters being
killed off. The cultural narrative
became that gay characters died,
one that we have evidently not
moved past.
In the context of this current
discussion stemming from the
death of a lesbian, it is worth noting
the specific toxicity relating to
lesbian representation in media.The
history of women dying in media
has intrinsic roots in misogyny. The
concept of women in relationships
with other women has long been
fetishised by the straight cis-men
that control the production and
distribution of mainstream media.
This meant that in the 1950s a
huge quantity of pulp lesbian novels
were produced that allowed the
fetishisation of these relationships,
long before the taboo that would
not allow them to be considered
as healthy or meaningful was left
behind. And so to allow for their
production within the social climate
of the time, the lesbian couple could
never have a happy ending. The two
most common options for the end
of these novels were for one woman
to go insane (as homosexuality was
still viewed as an actual mental
disorder), or one woman to die and
the other to return to a heterosexual
relationship. This is sadly a trope
that doesn’t seem to be expiring any
time soon.The belief of many media
creators seems to be that lesbian
characters are allowed only if the
women remain sexually available
to men, or that their relationship is
only sexual.
We’ve seen the overall cultural
trend shift in recent years but it
fundamentally remains that LGBT
people suffer. In modern media
this is often more in the context
of noble suffering in the face of an
unforgiving world, from violence,
disease, or AIDS. It remains the
overwhelming majority of films and
books in which LGBT people suffer
outweighs all other narratives.
The 100 playing in to this
narrative has provoked what can
only be a long overdue conversation.
The campaign springing from the
episode continues to put pressure
on the industry, and maintains
a fundraising arm that is raising
money for the LGBT suicide
prevention organization The
Trevor Project. The drive has raised
over $120,000 from nearly 4000
individual donations. In the words
on their website “There is not much
we can do in the way of changing
what’s already been written. What
we can do however, is unite to
help those who are hurting and
despondent through this.” All I can
say is that it really is time for the
Bury Your Gays trope to die.
Reflections on the Barbican Estate
Hussain Al-Jabir
Writer
F
riends of mine will know
that I have a great affinity
for F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The
Great Gatsby. His timeless
exposé of the superficiality of the
nouveau riche and the upper classes,
examined in cinematic description,
is simply breath-taking, with a
message that is as pertinent today as
in the contemporary era.Though the
book is more usually associated with
love and materialism,the spectacular
and haunting descriptions at the
close of the novel shed light on
failed aspirations; something which
I encountered myself not too long
ago.
Before this begins to sound too
much like the English essays that
Imperial students shunned long
ago, I should explain further. I study
in St Bart’s Hospital, and walking
back one day from Waitrose – yes,
I was picking up free coffee, and no
please don’t judge me – I chose to
walk through the Barbican Estate,
between the tower blocks instead
of the tunnel beneath its buildings.
I chose the path “less travelled”,
and just as Robert Frost thought,
I believe “that has made all the
difference”.
I’d never really thought much
about the Barbican Estate before.
Located on the fringes of the City,
I pass by the concrete tower blocks
regularly on my way to the hospital,
but usually think of it as little more
than a lamentable 1960s relic, an
eyesore to regret, not revere. During
the war, the City was heavily
bombed and mostly destroyed,
requiring extensive renovation.
Among the unrealised plans of
building giant motorways through
central London and excavating
enormous underground carparks
– sensing a theme here? – the
Barbican Estate was meant to be
the epitome of a new architectural
vision, with public courtyards
interspersed between ‘modern’tower
blocks. Gone were the medieval
alleyways, the Barbican would
feature “streets in the sky”, in a
utopian fantasy built from state-of-
the-art reinforced concrete. Three
of the tallest residential towers
in London would dominate the
skyline, while a moat would conjure
images of an ancient castle within
the post-modern setting. This was
the future in 1970,and the Barbican
Centre was its archetype.
Fast-forward forty years and the
utopian visions have faded with
the weathering of the concrete
façades. “Streets in the sky” turned
into corners for crime, while the
grandiose fantasies of the public
strolling through were replaced by
busy commuters rushing through
a tunnel built for function, not
fascination. No longer a vision of
modernity, the Barbican Estate
has become a symbol of the short-
sightedness of 1960s architecture
and many would not object to its
demolition.

Walking as I did on that day,
I saw something quite different.
Staring at sights, otherwise etched
into memory, I saw past my current
vision, right back to its soul, which
taken literally is the very essence
The concrete colossus captures the optimism of
the architechural era
of its existence. Along the sculpted
pathways,you cannot fail to note the
sheerscaleandscopeofthearchitects’
visions. The optimism with which
the towers are named after great
British authors. The persistence of
a small puddle, the only remains
of a great moat surrounding this
fortress of modernity. And above
all, you cannot ignore the sense of
hope – the hope that people would
walk around the estate, and enjoy it,
rather than taking the road tunnel.
Looking around, instead of seeing
the estate as it is, I saw it just as
Fitzgerald’s Nick Carraway saw
Long Island inThe Great Gatsby:“A
fresh green beast of the new world”,
with all the hope and optimism of
a generation looking forward to
peacetime after decades of war. The
concrete may be rotting away today,
but the blazing passion underlying
the centre remains visible for as long
as it stands.
All things are transient, and this
realisation was no exception. A
vision seen for the first time is also
that vision seen for the last time.
Every time I go to St Bart’s hospital,
and every time I see the Barbican
again, it will still look as it always
does – a building of the past,démodé
to our eyes. For one metaphysical
hour, I saw past my own sight, to
aspirations long thwarted; if past
experience is proof,I shouldn’t think
I will see that again.
