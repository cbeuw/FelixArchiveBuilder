GAMES
W
hen The Legend
of Zelda: Twilight
Princess was first
released in 2006,
Nintendo was at a turning point.
It had just released the Wii, which
would radically alter its fortunes,
after years of losing sales to Sony
with the disappointing GameCube.
The years preceding this represented
some of Nintendo’s best, and
Twilight Princess, in its time, was
considered no exception. Since
then Nintendo have attempted to
streamline their games, making
them both accessible to core and
more casual audiences. Twilight
Princess was interesting in the fact
that it was released for both the
GameCube and Wii, with motion
controls added to the latter. The
Wii U version of the game is not
much more than a HD re-release
– removing the motion controls to
make it more like the original.
The Wii U, like the GameCube,
has not been the success Nintendo
had hoped for. Both have ended
up following similar paths, with
Nintendo, in defeat, focusing on its
core franchises and fans. Twilight
Princess was released during the
twilight period of the GameCube
and its HD update has been
similarly released during the end
days of the Wii U. By examining
the differences between the two
versions,we can come to understand
how Nintendo has changed in the
last decade.

D
r. Langeskov is the
first game by Crows
Crows Crows – a
studio formed by game
writer and designer William Pugh
of The Stanley Parable fame. The
first person exploration game, that
will be familiar to anyone who
has played Pugh’s previous works,
lasts around 20 minutes (it’s free,
so don’t complain). In this short
burst of narrative, Simon Amstell
voices a stage manager who talks
to the player over a loudspeaker.
His character is both charming and
hilarious (which pretty much sums
up Amstell).
However, the game’s title is
deceiving because, as the result
of some unexplained mishap, you
are unable to play the fictional Dr
Langeskov game, and must instead
ensure the game runs smoothly
behind the scenes. The player’s
environment becomes a metaphor
for the mechanics that come
together to form a game. Much like
a techie (the theatre sort), you must
pull levers and press buttons. And
nothing ever goes right.The ‘stage’
directs the player via humorously
labeleddoors,guidedinfurtherdetail
by Amstell’s often incomprehensible
directions. Although built in Unity,
through a combination of lighting
and minimal cell-shading the
environments are able to match the
atmosphere of more substantial,
retail games. Few studios deliver
such bold statements of intent with
their debut releases. Dr. Langeskov
is proof that games don’t need to be
long to be exciting or memorable.
of the game (which even in 2006
looked pretty bad) reflects the
relatively small increase in detail,
in both geometry and textures, that
Nintendo’s games have undergone
in comparison to their rivals.
A number of small gameplay
features have been simplified to
make certain interactions less
frustrating (the Wii U controller
makes switching items and between
Link and Wolf a doddle) – in the
same way that Nintendo has added
easy modes and refined player
interactions so that their games
are accessible to all. They may
have focused once again on core
franchises, but these games are
now more suited to ‘casual’ gamers.
Possibly the most illuminating
feature of the Twilight Princess HD
is its use of Amiibos,Nintendo’s toy-
to-life series. The implementation
here screams of a company out of
ideas, revisiting old franchises to
sell toys. Has Nintendo given up? It
seems so. There are no major games
on the horizon other than Zelda
Wii U (the only game they will be
showing at this summer’s E3). It’s
a sad time to be a Nintendo gamer
and a Wii U owner.
These are not only the twilight
years of the Wii U, but the twilights
years of an era of Nintendo defined
by a serious lack of growth.
