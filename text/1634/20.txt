T
he Techtonics, Imperial
College Union’s all-
male a cappella group,
have made international
history by becoming the first British
group to win the International
Championship of Collegiate A
Cappella.
The International Championship
of Collegiate A Cappella, or ICCA
for short, is a massive competition
of some 340 entrants, spread across
the north of America, split into 8
regions, with one more final region
in the UK. Only 10 groups progress
to the final on Broadway in New
York,and last weekend,representing
Imperial and the whole of the UK,
we were one of those teams.
The journey for us started back
in March 2015, when the then-
current, and future MDs, Alex
Moore and Ehsaan Shivarani,
started trying out arrangements,
discussing what songs to pick for
next year’s competition. In short,
each team has 12 minutes to present
their wares, doing whatever they
want. Soon, a set of all British songs
had emerged, and we were ready
to rehearse them. Roshani Abbey,
a fellow a cappella and musical
theatre enthusiast, joined our crew
shortly after starting rehearsals for
bits of our 4-song set.
In February and March, the
competition rounds began. We
passed our way through the quarter-
finals, and earned our place in the
semi-finals in London. It came as
a complete surprise when we beat
off all other UK groups, and got the
chance to compete on Broadway.
Getting there would be no easy
feat – with an August Edinburgh
fringe show already paid for, we
would have to raise another £6k to
get flights to New York. Not only
that,but the finals would occur right
in the middle of exams for most
of our members. Regardless, the
group persisted, even through one
member’s glandular fever a week
before the competition (wrecking
his singing voice), and flew out on
Friday evening, landing shortly
before midnight in JFK airport.
The first night, in “something of
a murder motel” was surprisingly
pleasant, managing to bag a
free breakfast the next morning.
With a troublesome journey into
The lowdown on theTechtonics win
Manhattan from the motel, we
barely made the theatre in time for
the intro brief before soundchecks.
With our speedy 20 minute
soundcheck done, we spent the rest
of the day absorbing what we could
of the beautiful New York scenery,
including a warm up in nearby
Central Park, before heading back
to the theatre. Disaster struck when
3 of our members, bass, beatbox and
a soloist, got stuck in the elevator
on their way to the green rooms
one hour before we were to open
the show. Seconds after the call was
made that The Techtonics should be
moved to a later slot, the trapped
singers emerged, and suddenly it
was all go. 15 minutes later, we were
ready in the wings,about to sing our
hearts out for the last time.
I’ll be honest, trying to describe
the experience of the performance
succinctly completely evade me.
Opening the last round of a
huge competition to a sell-out,
2800-strong, a cappella-frenzied
audience was one of the experiences
I will count as the best in my life.
To put things in perspective, the
Beacon Theatre is larger than every
single theatre in London. And the
whole audience was whooping and
screaming like only an American
crowd can.
The next 4 songs went by in a
blur, with my recollection of the

Me Down, and finally to The Beatles

existing because I had practiced it
hundreds of times and knew each
chord progression like the back of
my hand. I remember snippets of
a quick debrief in our green room
following our breathless exit from
the stage, with some well-wishes
to the other groups occurring
somewhere in between.
I won’t bore you with the details
of the other sets from the US
groups, suffice to say they were
slick and impressive, all of them.
when we returned to the stage for
the announcement, we were met
with cheering, applause, and general
elation that defied belief. The huge
trophy, and with it, the international
championship of collegiate a
cappella, was ours.
Since then,it has been a whirlwind
of activity. We were invited to go
on the radio the next morning,
and have had endless tweets, some
from producers and actors (Skylar
Astin, ‘Jessie’ from Pitch Perfect!),
and trying to get the trophy back
home on the flight was a nightmare.
Hopefully it will be on display
somewhere in college soon. We’re
proud that for the first time in the
competition’s history, we’ve brought
the win back to the UK.

O
ne of my favourite
things about playing
the French horn is
that you get called
in to play in concerts at the last
minute pretty often. At Imperial
the concerts usually tend to end up
being actually really good and so
it’s always quite exciting to get the
opportunity to play with groups
here. Last week I got to play in
the ICSM Music Society Concert
and it basically lived up to all my
hopes for a concert and massively
surpassed my expectations for a
night that the only details I’d really
been given beforehand were ‘turn
up for rehearsal at 4.30,St Stephen’s
Church’.
The ICSM Music Society
Concert is a really special event that
has all five of the ensembles under
the ICSM Music umbrella (Choir,
Chamber Choir, Orchestra, Jazz
Band and Bands) come together
to perform under the same roof.
With exams and deadlines a
serious looming threat through any
Summer term, each ensemble only
had an allocated two rehearsals for
the concert but had clearly worked
hard to produce the standard of
music the night saw.
The night started with four pieces
ICSM Music Society Concert
by Jazz Band, which included
truly incredible solos from Auriol
Harford and Joseph Derry. Choir
then took the stage for a song from
the musical Oh Kay! and a beautiful
spiritual Ezekiel Saw De Wheel. The
first half then finished with four
pieces from the Bands,one of which
was written by Music societies own
Ben Lau, called ‘Shine On’ and
certainly went a long way to proving
that Imperial has students that are
phenomenal at way more than just
their degrees!
The second half started with two
songs from Chamber choir, one was
a piece by Olga Gjielo inspired by
the aurora borealis and performed
just as beautifully. The other was a
jolly English madigral that picked
the mood in the room right up
ready for Choir to return to the
stage to sing Aerosmith’s ‘I don’t
want to miss a thing’, arranged by
Dominic Lagrue as a thank you for
the effort and joy the group showed
in choir all year.
After a brief pause to get orchestra
set up, the Orchestra performed
a Rimsky Korsakov ‘Fantasy on
Serbian Themes’ and a James Bond
Medley which were met with
enthusiastic audience response.
Orchestra was then joined by the
choir for a brilliant ending to the
concert, performing the Triumphal
March from Aidia.
I had an incredible time and I
really would urge you to check out
the ICSM Music society, I’ve yet to
be disappointed by a concert.
