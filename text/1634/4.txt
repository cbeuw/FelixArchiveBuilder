Newcastle Students Union to sell drug-testing kits
Grace Rahman
Editor-in-Chief
N
ewcastle university’s
students union is to
sell drug-testing packs
to its students – not to
test them for drugs – but to test the
drugs themselves.
The single use tests require
students to use a small amount of
their drugs,and a colour comparison
chart to give an indication as to what
the substances actually contain.
The £7 kits, subsidised to £3 for
students, will be available from the
students’ union.
There are two tests included: one
for MDMA and one for ketamine,
but they can be used together to get
an idea of what other nasties your
drugs might contain.
This new policy for Newcastle SU
comes a month after a 17 year old
died in Manchester after taking a
‘Mastercard’ ecstasy pill, and the
deaths of four people in Shropshire
after taking ‘Superman’ pills last
year.
Ecstasy, Cocaine and Ketamine
can be cut with sugar,rat poison and
washing powders, or more seriously,
can contain high concentrations
of far more dangerous compounds
related to main component.
The ‘Superman’ pills were found
to contain high doses of PMMA,
which is toxic in far lower doses
than ecstasy. The kits being sold in
Newcastle can differentiate between
these two substances.
The idea has been pushed by the
Students for Sensible Drug Policy
group at Newcastle, who earlier this
year petitioned the university to
change its ruling on students found
with drugs in halls for the first time.
The kits will tell you if your drugs are safe
The £7 kits,
subsidised
to £3 for
students,
will be
available
from the
students’
union
Instead of an immediate fine and
eviction, students found with illegal
drugs in university accommodation
are now given a second chance, as
long as they were not caught doing
it again.
Love hearts, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll.
A
debate about Britain’s
place in the EU is due
to take place at Imperial
on the 2nd
of June.
Representatives from both camps
will be there to argue over whether
we should vote to leave the EU on
the 23rd
of June.
Speaking for remain is Amelia
Womack, the deputy leader of the
Green party. An Imperial alumnus,
Womack stood for the Greens in
several constituencies before being
voted deputy leader, making her the
youngest of any political party.
Unusually, the advocate for leave
is a staunch socialist: the writer and
journalist, Tariq Ali. He was born
in Pakistan and became politically
active in his teenage years before
studying PPE at Oxford. He now

the London Review of Books. He’s
written several books, including
Bush in Babylon, criticising the
2003 invasion of Iraq through the
media of poetry and essays.
The event is being organised by
ICU’s Left Forum, a new group
that aims to hold events, campaigns
and discussion on politics. The club
is currently in the union’s ‘incubator’
period, on the way to becoming an
official club.A successful EU debate
is likely to work in their favour on
the way to becoming an official ICU
endorsed club.
The debate is on the 2nd
of June
in Skempton LT 164. Check the
Facebook event for updates on

Rent strikes spread across London universities
1000 students across UCL, Roehampton, Goldsmiths and the Courtauld are
withholding rent in protest
S
tudents from Goldsmiths,
Roehampton and the
Courtauld Institute have
joined UCL in a rent strike,
protesting the high fees and low
quality housing offered by their
universities. It’s been estimated that
this amounts to about £1 million’s
worth of lost revenue from all the
students combined.
Unsurprisingly, the NUS has fully
backed the strikes. The NUS DP of
Welfare, Shelly Asquith, said: “If a
national rent strike for affordable
student housing were to happen,the
union would support it 100%.”
750 students from UCL did not
pay their third term’s rent,which was
due last Friday. 150 students started
the strike in January, and have been
joined by hundreds of others thanks
to a high profile campaign.
This number now accounts for
15% of UCL students in halls.They
are demanding a 40% rent cut.
After an unsuccessful meeting
Its grand opening happened on Friday
C
haring Cross Hospital’s
only onsite bar has finally
been refurbished by the
union, after consultation
with students.
Street and hospital signs
‘borrowed’ from other trusts still
hang on the walls, but the bar’s logo
has become slightly snazzier.
There is no lime green to be seen.
The union promised that the new
bar’s floor is “100% less sticky”.
As part of a consultation survey,
student opinions on the bar’s new
look were gathered. The most
common suggestion was an old-
fashioned pub-like spaces with
“booths”, “wood” and “leather”.
Students seemed to want less plastic
furniture and more of a heritage
vibe.
With a hospital on one side and
a graveyard on the other, the 450
capacity space is a space well-
known to medical students as the
final destination for many freshers
fortnight events. The bar also serves
food during the day.
The refurbishment was revealed
at an exclusive launch party for
BNOCs last Friday, where The
Techtonics performed.
The bar is having an official re-
launch tonight (Friday the 13th
).

with their college management, 300
students at Goldsmiths withheld
a rent payment last Monday. On
average, they pay £150 per week.
Eight students from Roehampton
are understood to be withholding
rent, according to the university’s
accommodation office.
Goldsmiths’ Cut the Rent
campaign told students in a

Facebook FAQ that withholding
rent now would not even risk
eviction as “you’ll have moved out
of halls by the time they could evict
you”. The Goldsmiths campaign
also warns that their university’s
threats of fines for late payments
would be just that: threats, as there
is nothing in their housing contracts
about such charges.
The possibility of eviction is
real, but universities are unable to
threaten students much further than
that, as it is illegal to academically
penalise for non-tuition fee debts.
From a PR and student welfare
angle, evicting students during
exam season is not a great option
for the universities.
Last year, a successful UCL rent
strike resulted in students winning
back a term’s rent (£1368 each).
UCL have also been accused
of nelgecting student welfare by
cutting all bursaries for low income
students. This has only added fuel
to the fire of the Cut the Rent
campaign.
In a meeting with strikers, UCL’s
Head of Estates said he didn’t take
into account low income students
when deciding rents, adding that
some students “simply could not
afford to live in London, and that is
just a fact of life”.
