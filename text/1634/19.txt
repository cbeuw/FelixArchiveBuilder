This week you are Zac
Goldsmith. After losing the
London mayoral election,
you can now relax in
Richmond Park, watch some
of your favourite Bollywood
films and finally work out
how to use the Central line.

This week you are the
president of the Rifle and
Pistol club. Incensed by
the mockery in this week's
Hangman, you try and storm
the FELIX office. Your
tiny bullets fail to do much
damage, and you have to
retreat, defeated.
This week you're gliding
society. You literally have
planes. Do you really need
your own planes? Can't you
borrow someone else's? That
seems kinda ridiculous and
excessive when some of us
out here are just trying to get
a grant for a social or three.
But who needs socials when
you have planes.
This week you're Katie
Hopkins and you threatened
to run naked down Regents
Street with a sausage up
your bum if Sadiq Khan
became London Mayor.
He did though, so you
followed through, in scenes
reminiscent of an IC Rugby
initiation.
This week, unsure which way
to vote in the EU referendum,
you decide to race crabs to
decide your allegiance. After
the crabs refuse to race and
begin to make tender crab
love you realise that this is a
sign. The system is fucked, so
you spoil your ballot.
This week you’re an animal-
loving, privileged as fuck,
life scientist who thinks
that poor people should be
allowed to starve to death
to prevent overpopulation.
Congratulations, you’re
David Attenborough!
This week, you’re the people
who continuously write
about sex in FELIX. Yeah,
we get it, you’re getting laid.
Congratulations! Now shut
up about it.
This week, you’re the lecturer
who collects the centrefolds
every week and has them all
stuck up in the inside of a
cupboard somewhere obscure
in the Huxley building that
you call your “happy place”.
This week you named
"RRS Boaty McBoatface"
RRS David Attenborough.
Democracy is dead. The
fall of civilisation has come
and precisely in the manner
Orwell predicted it.
This week, you don’t like
something in FELIX, so you
grab all the copies you can
find and hide them in a back
office. Unfortunately for you,
the truth cannot be stopped,
and a window left open
allows all the copies to fly out
onto the festival below. Yes,
there was a paedo.
This week, while trying to
test your drugs for toxic
substances and generally
have a safe night out, you
accidentally create a new
form of ecstasy from Daz,
rat poison and bits of old
Ketamine you found on the
old furniture from Reynolds.
You tell the world it’s safer
than horseriding and are
kicked out of Imperial.
This week, you decide to
make a group Tinder account
as a club. You don't realise
that you're required by
union by-law to make your
swipe history available on
eActivities, which makes for
an awkward first round of
budgeting.

here’s nothing wrong
with guns, chaps. Guns
don’t kill people, people
kill people! And there’s
nothing I love more than people,
except people with guns.
Hey, look, it’s not like it sounds,
I’m not some kind of NRA fanatic!
I love that Michael Moore, movie,
what was it called, shooting
children dead at Columbine? I can't
remember now.
Guns are important to man (and
woman – yes, we have had female
members for well over a decade
now!) and there’s nothing wrong
with hunting animals, shooting bits
of paper shaped like humans or just
learning how to defend oneself in
this insecure place we call Sadiq
Khan’s London!
I just don’t see the problem people
have with recreational firearm use.
If I’m of sound mind, and I don’t
refer to it as my shooty shooty bam
bam stick (you know the rules,
Hugo!) what’s wrong with me and
the lads (and ladies!) from the club
selling our members rounds of
ammunition via the union website,
you know?
We live in a free country, where
licensed gun ownership is allowed.
No lunatics here shooting up
schools. It’s actually an insult to
the guns for you to bring up mass
shootings, so, you know, apology
accepted. Jeremy Corbyn can rip
this gun from my cold dead hands
(if he even knows how to properly
handle it, ha ha ha!) and even then
I would have a smaller air pistol
in my boot to frighten the living
daylights out of him!
