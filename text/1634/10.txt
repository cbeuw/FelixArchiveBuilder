The protest album of the decade
ANOHNI’s solo debut album is an unhinged attack on the status quo
H
ope was the word that
came to represent
Obama’s presidential
campaign back in
2008. For a few brief moments the
world – inspired by Shepard Fairey’s
iconic poster – genuinely believed
that change might finally come to
neoliberal America. After eight
years in office, Obama has grown
old and the energy that once defined
him has dissipated,along with many
of his promises. ANOHNI’s debut
solo album Hopelessness is not kind
to America and Obama. It presents
the obvious truths and struggles that
have defined the politics of the 21st
Century: the rise of drone warfare,
the defeat of environmentalism,
mass-surveillance, and the
hypocritical attitude of Western
nations. It is always direct; nothing
is ever held back or hidden under
multiple layers of meaning. The
result is a beautifully modern and
accessible experimental protest
record.
Co-produced by both Ross
Birchard (Hudson Mohawke) and
Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point
Never), the album is often dark and
brooding,complementing its serious
subject matter. At other times, the
tone is more upbeat – emulating
pop songs to reflect the glorification
of death and justice in some parts of
American society. On ‘Execution’,
ANOHNI sings “Execution / It’s
an American dream,” with the
former delivered so enthusiastically
that it sounds like a celebration.
This song, like many others on the
album, is draped in irony. In a more
hushed voice ANOHNI reminds us
of the hypocrisy of America. “Like
the Chinese and the Saudis / The
North Koreans and the Nigerians,”
America is one of the few nations
that still has the death penalty.
On the back of her Academy
Award nomination this year for
Best Original Song ‘Manta Ray’ –
a song about biodiversity and the
destruction of nature – ANOHNI
reflects further on the environment
during the album’s lead single ‘4
Degrees’.Likemuchofthealbum,on
‘4 Degrees’ performs as an alter-ego
of sorts; this character contradicts
drone bomb.” From this perspective
she exclaims “Drone bomb me /
Blow me from the mountains / And
into the sea.” Looking at the choice
of themes reflected on throughout
the album, this is more than just a
criticism of America – it is aimed at
Obama himself.
Drone bombing is one of the
many things that has increased in
frequency under his administration.
Another high profile issue that
comes up – brought to light in
2013 by Edward Snowden – is
the NSA’s mass surveillance of
American citizens. ‘Watch Me’ is a
conversation with an NSA agent:
“I know you love me / ‘Cause you’re
always watching me.” ANOHNI
criticises a system that suggests
it is trying to protect us from evil,
terrorism and child molesters (this
is her list, not mine) but is based on
the assumption we are all guilty.
reflecting the prophet-like status
Obama secured in his initial
campaign for president: “When
you were elected / The world cried
for joy.” But now he is “Punishing
the whistleblowers / Those who
tell the truth” – a stark contrast to
his promise of a new politics and
radical change.
The final two tracks offer little
hope.They paint a picture of a planet
destroyed by over-consumption.
Even ANOHNI admits “I’ve
been taking more than I deserve.”
‘Marrow’, the album’s closer is a
metaphor for America’s exploitation
of the world’s resources and
governments; it has unashamedly
extracted and injected. There is no
hope: “We are, we are all Americans
now.”
Hopelessness by ANOHNI is out
now on Rough Trade
temperature by the end of the
century (if no actions are taken), she
sings: “It’s only 4 degrees, it’s only 4
degrees / I wanna see this world, I
wanna see it boil.” While this is an
obvious attack on her government,
it is possible she is also examining
her own attitude to the environment
and her lack of action.This theme of
hopelessness and inability to force
change throughout the world runs
through the album.
The message of ‘I Don’t Love You
Anymore’, in contrast to rest of the
album, is far less obvious: “You left
me in a broken world / You left me
lying in the street / You left me
without body heat.” It seems more
like an attack on the general system
of capitalism (that America exports
globally) than an attack on a specific
section of American oppression.
‘Drone Bomb Me’ focuses on
drone warfare and the West’s acts
of terror throughout the world.
ANOHNI describes it as “a love
song from the perspective of a girl in
Afghanistan…looking up at the sky
and she’s gotten herself to a place
where she just wants to be killed by a

The most open attack on Obama
is on the track named after him.
It is delivered like a call to prayer,
her own opinions but does so in a
manner which is blatantly sarcastic,
but could easily be mistaken for
the establishment. In reference to
