Rag Mag:
Bad Taste?
The Imperial College Rag Mag
was used as an example of
racism in British universities by
the Guardian. A joke from the
1981-82 Rag Mag was used to
start the article which was a
description of 'The pressures of
being a black woman studying
in the New Right's latest
recruiting ground: Britain's
university campuses' that
appeared on July 30th. The
article was written by Chinyelu
Onwurah.
Ms Onwurah claims in her article
that 'Extreme nationalism is...far
too fashionable.' She criticises
organisations such as the
Libertarian Alliance, a faction
within the Federation of
Conservative Students, for
advocating the hanging of
Nelson Mandela and Arthur
Scargill. The attitude of this
group to black people, she
claims, is blatantly racist.
In an interview with FELIX, Ms
Onwurah said that she could not
speak for all black people at IC.
She alledged, though, that in her
view the College establishment
and the Union did not support
black students. She described
the atmosphere at IC as right
wing and hence hostile to black
people at IC. The article, she
said though, wasn't about IC but
Universities in general. Ms
Onwurah said The South African
bar night, the Royal School of
Mines Union attempted to
organise last year, was an
example of racism at IC.
Union President, Carl Burgess,
wrote to the Guardian saying
that he 'had never been
subjected to any form of racist
activity'. He told FELIX that he
found it incredible that someone
who had only studied at one
university for one year could
write an article for a national
newspaper on racism in
universities. He criticised Ms
Onwurah for not contacting IC
Union about racism at IC.
The Guardian article
This year's Imperial College
Rag Mag will contain several
jokes about the Bradford City
fire. The printers, Technoprint
2000, have asked to have their
address removed from the
publication because they fear
that being based in Leeds, they
may offend some of their
neighbours who lost relatives in
the fire
Union sabbaticals have the
right to edit the Rag Mag. They
used this right to remove many
of the racist jokes and all the
jokes about the famine in
Ethiopia..ICU President, Carl
Burgess, told Rag Mag Editor,
Tony Spencer that he thought
the jokes about the fire were in
bad taste. He advised Mr
Spencer to remove the jokes. Mr
Spencer phoned the printers
who said they would print the
jokes. Mr Spencer and Mr
Burgess then agreed that the
jokes would remain in the Rag
Mag.
Mr Spencer has written to
FELIX justifying his decision to
print the jokes. He claims that
'We have to be able to laugh
things off and soldier on with
life'. He adds that the jokes are
included T o make people think
about the situations, and why
they think they are funny. This is
in a hope that they will then
realise that what they are doing
is terrible and want to do
something about the situation'.
The Rag Mag will be on sale
from the start of September.

like to congratulate the couple

This is your
Leader
Gareth Fish
Gareth Fish is the new
Postgraduate Group Chairman.
Last Wednesday's meeting of
the PG Group failed to elect a
PG Group Chairman as nobody
decided to stand for the post.
The meeting gave Chris Hendy,
the outgoing PG Group
Chairman, the power to appoint
a Chairman which he did later
on in the week.
Other officers of the PG
Group elected at the meeting
included Secretary, Helena
Bramwell and Treasurer, Chris
Martin. The only post still vacant
is that of PG Handbook editor.
Hugh Stiles, last year's editor,
urged anyone interested in
doing the job to come and see
him. He stressed that no
previous experience was needed.
