I By now everyone should have
realised that August 1985 is
the 40th Anniversary of the
Hiroshma and Nagasaki
Atomic bombings. To
II commemorate this, there have
been television
• documentaries, radio shows,
s newspaper articles - and
books. The Postman of
Nagasaki is one of these.
By centrating on how the
terrible effects of a single
(0.2mton) atomic bomb nearly
H
I ruined an individual life, Peter
Townsend emphasises a fact
m that many world leaders, then
1| and now, appear to forget;
H that every single one of their
:subjects matter, not just the
;;1 uncomfortably bunkered civil
servants who 'deserve to
survive'.
Although Sumiteru, the 16
year old postman provides the
m main biographical interest, the
tragedy of many other victims
and hibakusha (survivors) is
S used to underline the way that
the 'little people' were
wantingly destroyed. Apart
from Sumiteru, who had all
II the skin on his back flayed off
M by the heat before being
tossed to the ground by the
H pressure wave, we are told of
H the children who had waved
H to him moments before who
became 'small white shapes,
H reminding him of leaves
H scattered by an Autumn wind;'
or the little girl, found by a
; British POW, sitting still from
• shock;...'she had appeared
unhurt but...the other side of
her small body was charred
black. Where her right eye
I had been there remained only
a blank white cavity'.
The tales of the internal
political machinations of
Washington and Tokyo are
I revealed, but not totally, one
suspects. The temptation to
H simphstically portray Truman
as a monomanic egotist has
not been avoided. The old
argument that the dropping of
the first bomb at least, was
: necessary, is rejected as a
fallicy - the President's two
senior military advisors
apparantly tried to dissuade
him from the drop. Japanese
people are represented as the
innocent victims of two insane
governments.
This book cannot make up
its mind whether to be a
documentary, a biography or
a condemnation, but skillfully
manages to be each in
different places, though the
dearth of accurate statistical
information lets down the
documentary side a bit. Not
recommended for reading
whilst depressed or listening
to Pink Floyds 'Final Cut', but
a must for anyone who wants
to judge the nuclear arms
question with anything like an
unbiased view.
Millennium
John Varley
Millennium by John Varley
(Sphere £1.95) appears in a
silver jacket with a pretty
piccy in a cut-out. All in all it
looks as big a hype as a book
can get. Do Not Be Deceived:
this is a good book, dealing
with the serious problems
involved with time travel in a
very intelligent way.It's told
from two view points (mostly):
that of an aeroplane crash
investigator, and that of a
woman from a dismally
depressing future some 50,000
years ahead, who's been
rescuing people from air and
other disasters. The handling
of time travel and the
paradoxical situations is on
the whole intelligent, but with
some strange oddments
thrown in like, a paradox
travels through time at a
speed of 200 years per hour.
These all serve the plot well,
though, as the paradox which
has been created races into
the future to end a world that
had almost died out anyway.
The ending is somewhat
deus ex machina (almost
literally) but it all seems to fit
in. I enjoyed it, and suggest
you ignore the cover and read
it too.
Millenium is available SFSoc
library, which is open every
Thursday lunchtime during
the term.
Fruits of Passion
ICA
The Fruits of Passion is a
French/Japanese production
dealing with obsession,
absolute love and solitude. It
isn't exactly the best thing to
watch after a hard days work.
The story is of a beautiful
French woman, O, who, due
to a tortured upbringing, falls
Even though a picture may
paint a thousand words, the
written form has been the
major form of handing down
information, especially of
abstract ideas, even in recent
history. As Scientists, we are
trained to observe and record
briefly and precisely. It can be
fun, however, to write not
factually, but in imagry. For
instance, this football match
was a World Cup qualifier in
the early 'seventies, between
Brazil and a Scandanavian
team, and Pele had scored the
best goal I had ever seen.
'Pele! Pele!', chanted the
Santos crowd, as the master
organises his team mates,
conducting a Brazilian
orchestra of skill to strike at
the opposing defence. The
football player was
outragously flamboyant, but a
delight to watch and the
eleven tormented Swedes
could only join the crowds
applause. In
acknowledgement to Pele,
King of football.
Or how about this
discription of the final,
deciding bowl (inspired by
Doug Armstrong playing Mark
Maddison's Mum in Hyde
Park) in a championship
match.
The all-white of the players,
reminiscent of pre-war
cricketers, was vividly
contracted by the immaculate
green. A cautious whisper of
Good Luck showed that
sportsmanship had survived
through the worlds troubles as
an age old idea in these age
old bodies. The years of
experience guiding,
calculating the team, speed
and trajectory of the bowl
which spun and swerved,
turning into the little target -
now reached. It sighed heavily
and slowed to a stop. Indeed
this was poetry in motion,
performed with the grace of
precision.
If you can come up with
anything heavily-laced with
descriptive, imaginative terms,
send them via the FELIX
Office. It can be a long piece
or just a phrase, eg. Michael
Robinson (then Liverpool)
'...was an elephant, playing in
a herd of gazelles...' Again a
£10.00 prize for best entry.
Please also note last issue
competition is still open.
in love with the sadistic Sir
Stephen (Klaus Kinski). He
tests her love by making her
agree to prostitute herself in a
Chinese brothel and takes
great pleasure in watching as
she is left at the mercy of all
comers. A sound performance
from the French actress,
Isabelle llliers as O and Peter
as the Madame. However
Klaus Kinski was
dissappointing failing to
convey the insecurity and
madness of Stephen. This
contrasts with the book
'Return to the Chateau' on
which the film was based. The
film was confusing because
the audience is left wondering
why Stephen is reduced to
watch O like a pornographic
peep show. Stephen
eventually commits suicide
when O falls in love with a
young, communist
revolutionary. The film does
have some wonderful imagery
in it but this sadly does not
compensate for the
appaulingly bad script.
The Fruits of Passion is a
very arty film with English
subtitles and unlikely to
appeal to the average IC
student. It is erotica verging
on pornography but very
tasteful. Perhaps a fellow critic
summed it up when she
stormed out in the middle
shouting 'How can you
perverts watch this shit?'.
Winston Tong
ICA
Winston Tong has an amazing
stage presence. Few
performers could sing along
to backing tracks for almost
an hour without moving and
not become boring. One
could criticise the quality of
the backing tracks, the
irritating French accent that
Winston Tong appears to
adopt and several other small
points. To do so, though, is
stupid. The evening was an
excellant demonstration of
quality singing and quality
music.
