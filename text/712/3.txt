•The 85° Show
At the Serpentine Gallery in
Kensington Gardens this week
there's the Time Out
sponsored '85° Show'. It's
premiering the work of
graduates from the 16 London
Art Colleges. It's within easy
walking distance and open 7

•Buddhism
You've got lots of time to see
the Buddhism 'Art and Faith'
Exhibition at the British
Museum as it's running until
5th January 1986. It's a
chance to get a look at the
Far Eastern Buddhist cultures;
there ideas, beliefs and
traditions. Admission is free

Saturday and 2.30-6pm
Sundays. It's in Montague
Place, WC1 and they have a
special recorded message

1788.
•German Art
I doubt many of you have ever
been into the Goethe Institute
even though it's only in
Princes Gate. Now you've got
an excuse as there's an
exhibition currently running
there which gives you a
glimpse at the new German
Art Movement, and the work
of 'Eight Young German
Artists' (The exhibition's title)
who received scholarships
enabling them to work in
London during 1984/85.
Entrance is free.

»Shakespeare
It's no secret that I'm a great
fan of RSC's Roger Rees so
I'm certainly going to see their
production of 'Love's Labours
Lost' at the Barbican Theatre
this week. It's also got Josette
Simon as Rosaline. What
more could you want? All
details can be obtained from
the Box Office on 01 628 8795

»Carmel
Don't forget that Carmel is
playing Ronnie Scott's on
Sunday 18th August at 8pm.
Tickets are £5 in advance and
£6 on the night.
•Summer Pops
My only claim to fame is that I
went to the same primary
school as the BBC Young
Musician of the Year, Emma
Johnson, so I feel that I ought
to recommend that you go to
the Barbican Hall on
Wednesday 14th August.
She'll be playing the clarinet
along with Kenny Baker on
trumpet and Johnny
Dankworth conducting. It's
part of the Daily Mail/LSO
Summer Pops season running
from 8-15 August. Also, on the
night after, there's the very
patriotic 'All British Night' with
the likes of Richard Stilgoe,
George Chisholm, Sarah
Brightman and Paul Miles-
Kingston. Both shows start at
7.45pm and tickets are
£9,£8,£7,£5.50,£4 and £3. Box
Office 01 638 8891.
•Sound and Light
Remember reading about Son
et Lumiere productions in
your French books at school?
If you do and you wouldn't
mind going to see one then
there's an English production
at Horseguards Parade, SW1,
every day next week at 9pm.
The 'Son' is courtesy of
Antony Andrews, Peter
Barkworth, Penelope Keith,
Sir John Gielgud and Edward
Woodward to name but a few.
•Ancestry
If you've a day or even a week
to spare then why not
research into your ancestors?

Kingsway, WC2. It's a lengthy
process but admission is free
