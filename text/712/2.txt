meeting were either
unavailable or not at College.
9. Carl Burgess and Dave
Kinston thus took direct and
rapid action, basing their
decision on less than half the
facts.
10. At no time has Indsoc
objected to the principle of
its external bank account
being monitored or audited.
I am also disturbed by the
allusions of mismanagement
in your editorial and would
like to make clear a number
of points:
1. The Society's external
account is run along the
same union guidelines as our
SCC account.
2. The Union does indeed
have a duty to ensure that all
clubs do look after their
money properly. We can look
forward to an effective and
absolutely efficient Union
this coming year if the whole
Union clubs' finances are
given the same attention as
ours is receiving at present.
3. I doubt that many societies
have a turnover as great as
ours simply because few
other clubs organise nearly
as many events during the
y c v . To give some
examples—speaker meetings,
visits to factories, business
games* a Careers Fair, a
summer tour, a river cruise, a
magazine and that was just
last yaer. In total we
organised over 35 events last
year, spead over just two
terms. Next year will be even
busier.
4. From conversations I have
had with members of other
societies, I understand that
they too have had difficulties
with Union accounts,
particularly Summer Tour
accounts.
5. Until 10th June, no-one
had been given any formal
notice that we would be
disciplined. There have been
rumours, second-hand
information, but no direct
approaches and no
justifications.
6. The Union's action has
brought home to Indsoc the
need to establish
communication between the
two bodies.
The matter is now under full
discussion and I hope that
we will soon be able to come
to a permanent and
appropriate solution to a
diffiult problem.

Disasters are always nasty
things, though for some
inexplicable reason,
apparently more nasty and
tragic if they are closer to
home (for outsiders that is,
not bereaved next of kin).
As explained at length in
the Editorial to the Rag Mag,
most humour and hence jokes
are based on the misfortune
of some person or animal
(where they are not jokes
about ridiculous or impossible
situations), especially so when
they are topical. Most rag
mags (including ours in the
past) include one or two
topical jokes, often about
disasters such as airline
crashes, hotel bombings and
so on. These may offend a
few people, but on the whole,
more people find them
amusing because although
tragic situations are not nice,
tragedy does occur in life, and
we have to be able to laugh
things off and soldier on with
life. It is both difficult and
unfair to pick on one set of
jokes and say that they are
more offensive than others,
(to a particular set of people
they might be, but not to
other, different people) and so
the exclusion of a particular
set cannot be jusitified—if one
goes, they all go and there
would be no Rag Mag, and
therefore no income for Rag
to distribute to people who
suffer from misfortunes, and
are often forgotten and
pushed under the carpet.
Fuller reasons for the
inclusion of jokes are given,
as I said, in the Editorial to
the Rag Mag, which you will
be able to read in early
September, when the Rag
Mag will be available, but
basically thay are included to
make people think about
situations, and why they think
the jokes are funny. This is in
a hope that they will then
realise that what they are
doing is terrible, and want to
do something about the
situation.
If these jokes serve to keep
these ideas about how to
prevent these tragedies
happening again alive in
people's minds, then they will
have served their purpose,
even if they appear as just to
be in bad taste. When all the
problems of the world are
solved, then such humour will
become meaningless, and I
am eagerly awaiting that day.

Press freedom is crucial if a
state is to be truly democratic.
The Press has a duty to
question and challenge the
Society in which we live.
However it also has a duty to
be responsible. The recent
decision by the Governors of
the BBC to ban the 'Real
Lives' interview with Sinn Fein
was not a responsible editorial
decision. It was a decision
made because of political
pressure by the government.
Had the Governors made the
decision before Leon Brittan's
appeal nobody would have
condemed it as being
anything other than a
legtimate editorial decision.
Now, though, comments
about the climate of public
feeling are only poor attempts
by the Governors to justify
their weakness in bowing to
political pressure. Sinn Fein
are a legtimate political party.
Giving them access to TV and
radio enables people to judge
their arguments, something
that is essential in a free
society. Hopefully most
intelligent people will will see
how shallow Sinn Fein's
beliefs are FELIX supports
the NUJ in it's campaign
against the decision. If you
feel strongly about the
decision write to the
Governors of the BBC
protesting about the ban.
Rag Mag
It is disgusting for the
sabbaticals to use, as they
have, the principle of editorial
freedom to defend the
decision to include jokes on
the Bradford City fire in the
Tony Spencer:
the Rag Mag
The Editor of
Rag Mag. It is almost an insult
to BBC journalists. Editors
must always attempt to use
their power responsibly. The
Bradford City fire was horrific.
Over fifty people lost their
lives in the disaster. I'm sure
the people of Bradford and
Leeds are still exceptionally
sensitive about the whole
subject. To risk adding to
their sense of loss is
extremely irresponsible.
Nothing is gained by
including these jokes. Editors
can risk hurting people if, by
doing so, they do some good
to others. The Union
Sabbaticals are elected to act
as editors of the Rag Mag, the
Handbook etc. It is an
accepted part of their job. It is
not censorship for a senior to
edit a junior's work. They are
ignoring their responsibilities
when they claim they are
protecting Tony Spencer's
editorial freedom.
You may be thinking that
this issue doesn't effect you.
It does. The Rag Mag has the
words Imperial College
plastered all over it. That
means people form their
opinions of Imperial College
and you by reading this
publication.

Student Services have asked

Credits
This issue would have been
much naffer without Nigel
Atkinson, Kathy Tait, Tony
Churchill, Sarah Kirk, Chris
Edwards, Dave Clements,
Oligo, Tony Spencer, Judith
Hackney, Diane Love, Dave
Kingston and Alan Rose.
FELIX would like to apologise
to Mr Ian Bull for the
comments made in the last
editorial. Everyone we talked
to before that issue was
published had claimed that Mr
Bull was responsible for the
decision to purchase a boat.
Mr Simon Errington, ACC
Chairman, has now admitted
to taking the decision to
purchase the eight. FELIX
hopes that anyone who feels
strongly that the decision was
not in the best interests of IC
Union will blame Mr Errington
rather than Mr Bull.
