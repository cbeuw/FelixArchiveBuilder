WHILE THE SUN SHINES
This year, to the surprise of all,not
l e a s t the Dramatic Society i t s e l f , means f o r
a summer tour were again made available.
A play was decided upon, and John Askew
w i l l i n g l y came forward to produce i t . Miss
Rosemary M e l v i l l e , the able secretary, ar-
ranged "cheap wholesome lodgings" i n Bed-
ford, the town fated to reoieve the burnt
offering. Several oar t r i p s to Bedfor by
enthusiastic publicity agents ensued.
Posters were distributed l i b e r a l l y - to
the extent that the Town Clerk of Bedford
oajtplalned that they would k i l l the trees
cm whioh they had been pinned.
Rehearsal of the play "While the
Sun Shines" by Terence Rattigan, and the
building of the set began just eight days
before the f i r s t performance with no l i t t l e
trepidation! on the part af some actors, who
doubted t h e i r a b i l i t y to grasp their parts
i n so short a time. Towards the end of the
week the costumes arrived,whilst the scenery
was well on the way to completion. On
the Friday, Saturday and Sunday a l l the
transport that could be requisitioned, heavily
laden with scenery, actors and suitably/ be-
labelled with posters, set off f o r Bedford.
By this time i t was obvious that "the
sun was going to shine", and i n the longest
heat wave of the summer the society was per-
forming an the stage of the C i v i c Theatre,
s t i l l oovered with stage hands, putting the
finishing touches to the set.
The f i r s t performance,to a minute
audience, was marred only by the b e l l s
i n the neighbouring church steeple which
rang for an hour i n the middle of the
play. After each night's performance a
v i s i t was made to the "Rose", a l o c a l
pub, followed by midnight bathing i n the
r i v e r . During the day swimming, boating a
and tennis were indulged i n , whilst some
v i s i t e d Woburn Abbey.
By traditiOtt,after the l a s t per-
formance a party had been arranged. This
time i t was not the usual on-stage a f f a i r ,
but a barbecue by the r i v e r some miles
out of the town. This was a complete
success, although during the celebrations
a cider flagon was stolen by a l o c a l r e s i -
dent who was subsequently booked and
brought to t r i a l for the offence. This
was the only time the Dram. Soo.seemed to
be on the right side of a somewhat over
suspicious Bedford constabulary, who
throughout the tour kept a close watch on
the Theatre from the Police Station next
door.
As a holiday, this v i s i t waa wholly
successful: financially i t waa a d i s -
mal f a i l u r e . The troup l e f t one of i t s
awaabers more profitably installed as a
barman i n the "Hose".
IN MEM OR I AM
The paper b i r c h tree i n the North
Westerly part of the Beit Garden was
presented to the College by Miss Gladys
Duncan i n memory of her brother John
Dunean.who was a lecturer i n the C i v i l
Sngineerirg Dept. of the City and Guilds
OcOlegc froa 1946 to 1553 when he died
after a serious i l l n e s s .
SOCIAL WHIRL
Social l i f e at I.C. presents a wide
variety of distractions. In addition to the
weekly dances ('hops') the session i s
punctuated by such functions as the
Commemoration and Country House B a l l s ,
the Carnlvalia, and divers Rags and
Orgies.
L.C. heps are held every Saturday
evening, the band i s usually very good
jnrcviding music for both squares and hep-
cats. The quality of the women attending
i s good, and the quantity sufficient.
<\ A oi
The Commemoration B a l l i s publicised
elsewhere; the Country House B a l l i s held
i n May at Silwood Park, I.C.'s F i e l d
Station amidst the r u r a l beauties of the
Berkshire countryside.
a » of
Three times a year the Concert Hall i s
transformed into a w i l d and uninhibited
scene of gaiety V l a Parisienno. Panoily
dressed revelers dance to two bands,
participate i n the cabaret and dine o f f
ohipolatas and Mooney's much-vaunted
t r i f l e .
&uf
A solemn warning, there i s a tendency
on the part of the Constabulary to d i s -
oourase localised cloudbursts,and union
Meetings i n P i c c a d i l l y Station. Furthermore,
cars must not be parked on the 1st. and
2nd. floors of College buildings.
SAYING OF T H E FORTNIGHT
The Acting Editor of Phoenix:
"We must not be too ambitious"
TONY HODGSON
The non-appearance at the beginning
of this term of Anthony Hodgson the Vice
President of the R.C.S. Union and Chair-
man of the Social ClubsCctmdttee, has
been referred to i n the report of the Ex-
pedition that recently returned from
Norway. Tony and Mike Curb(whilst
olimbing a buttress on a mountain that
the whole party had previously surmounted,
were overtaken by bad weather. During
the descent,whilst Tony as the leader was
abseiling on the l a s t pitch,the piton
securing the rope dislodged i t s e l f , and
he f e l l 60ft. on to the rock below,
resulting i n a broken thigh, fractured leg,
serious injuries to his head and face,and
fractured arm. Hike Gorb managed to climb
down and run to the camp where the other
two members of the Expedition were working
and notified a rescue party to come to his
aid. The rescue party carried Tony on a
stretcher f a r seven houra-about half way
to the hospital. They were then met by
a helicopter sent by the Norwegian Authori-
t i e s , whioh flew Tony to Narvik where he
was taken to hospital. He has since made
good progress, and hopes to return to Eng-
land i n the near future.
