We axe, as always, glad to welcome
freshmen to the student community of I.e.,
hut with one or two reservations.
You have come to a college with i
reptrtatirmj a reptxtaitiax f o r spcrtsmsgm-
ship, i n i t i a t i v e and e s p r i t ds corps. The
current expeditions to Norway and the
Himalayas are examples of i n i t i a t i v e by
I.C. menj so was the recently departed
scientist who putted a golf b a l l from
Lincoln to Marble Arch.
The College reputation was b u i l t up by
people who gave their time and effort to
the Onion. I t was not b u i l t up by the men
who went home at 5 o'clock every night to
Putney .or Ealing, v i s i t i n g the Onion solely
for ths purpose of eating lunch i n the
refectory.
What we would l i k e to see from our
freshara i s not r e a l l y very much. A l i t t l e
time, a l i t t l e trouble, but above a l i a l i t t l e
enterprise,will win our welcome unre-
servedly. You w i l l Join the Societies you
are d i r e c t l y interested i n * How about
trying something you have never done before?
Try Hall Dinner, t r y the General Studios,
i f only to see what they are l i k e . You have
the key to a vastly interesting and reward-
ing l i f e . I f you r e t i r e into your own l i t t l e

As old lags w i l l have observed, the
price of FELIX has now r i s e n t o four-pence.
This i s not the Government's fault. The
reasons are f i r s t , we expect this issue to
be i n an improved, rather more expensive,
format; and seoond, we shall be able to
raise the standard of production, p a r t i -
cularly where photographs are concerned.
Having been unable to return to College
u n t i l the day before going t o press, the
Editor wishes to take this opportunity of
thanking John Bramley, Editor Bmeritus, who
oame out of retirement to organise and
produce, ably supported by Miss Elisabeth
Kranok, the major part of t h i s issue.

EXTRAMURAL
GENERAL STUDIES
General Studies lectures are held during
the extended lunch hour on Tuesdays and Thurs-
days. The topics are of a non-technical
nature, and range from railways to religiose
and music to medicine, Bisituted s i x years
ago, General Studies gives students the oha-
ohanoe to hear speakers who are experts i n
t h e i r particular f i e l d s . In the past we
have had v i s i t s from such eminent man as
Lord Brabazon of Tara, Julius Eatchen,
S i r Vincent Terraon, E r i o Shipton, DUys
Powell and Barnett Freedman.
The provisional programme for the coming
term should oontain enough to whet a l l
appetites. Ths f i r s t day's selection
(October 8th.) i s so good that i t i s a pity-
that a l l three speakers have clashed. We
are honoured with a v i s i t from S i r David
Keir, Master of B a l l i o l College, Oxford,
and a member of our Governing Body. There
are also A.L. Bacharaoh, recently appointed

ACTIVITIES
TOUCHSTONE
Most freshers, and many who are not
so fresh, may be puzzled by refersnoss on
notice boards and elsewhere to something
called TOUCHSTONE that i s b i l l e d as being
held at Imperial College F i e l d Station,
Silwood Park, Sunnlngdsle. Touchstone
weekends are held about twice a term i n
the beauties of the Berkshire countryside.
They were the brain c h i l d of the Late S i r
Roderio H i l l , and were intended aa an
opportunity of the s t a f f and students of
the College to meet i n informal sur-oundings.
There i s a theme f o r each weekend to whioh
a guest speaker pre-eminent i n his particu-
l a r f i e l d i s invited. In no circumstances
are the subjects f o r discussion to be of a
s c i e n t i f i c nature, and these meetings were
intended from the start to encourage the
r a t i o n a l i s a t i o n of the education of member!
of Imperial College. In part they are meant
to be the complement of General Studies
Lectures, and thus to enable students to
gain a wider understanding of that most
important faculty of the Human Mind, that
of clear thinking a l l i e d with the a b i l i t y
to express oneslf d e a r l y on Human Problems
to other members of w»r»n~^ without d i f -
f i c u l t y or embarassment.
