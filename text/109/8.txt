RUGBY
The 1.0, Rugby Club Is the strongest
olub i n the College and i t runs s i x teems
every Saturday. The Club has won the Lon-
don University Rugby Cup four tines i n the
l a s t s i x years and the 1st. XV has a very j
strong fixture l i s t . Every standard of
player i s catered, f o r i n the s i x teams and
i t i s hoped that a l l freshers who have played
rugby w i l l turn up at the t r i a l s on the
afternoons of Wednesday October 2nd., and
Saturday October 5th. at Harlington both
these days.
An added attraction to this year's
players i s the Xmas tour to South-western
Trance. The olub has fixtures against
Sari at (December 29), Saintes (January 1st),
and Eoyan (January 5).

So this i s the underwater sport!
For those who don't know, the I.C.
uhder-Water Club was only formed at the
end of the last session; f o r those who went
to the summer Diving Camp, the lack of pre-
paration made this painfully obvious.
The coast around the camp at Sharkham
Point (near Paignton) looked quite promising
for diving i n spite of hazards created by
Bank Holiday fishermen The f i r s t set-back,
that the promised large tents had not
materialised, r e a l l y made i t s e l f f e l t on
the f i r s t Wednesday when three of the five
tents were blown down during the night.
The drenched occupants were l e f t with the
alternative of crowding either into the
remaining tents or a oar.
These minor disoomforts apart, the sea
was surprisingly warm, and by the beginning
of the second week'everybody had lone some
diving with the aqualungs and as much
schnorkeling as they liked. One of our
number, to h i s surprise, speared a sizeable
grey mullet which the frying pan shortly
converted into a most edible dish. Later,
plaice, mackerel and crabs were caught by
less sporting means.
Towards the end of the fortnight, oamp
l i f e began to have i t s effect; tempers frayed
but the oamp bad served i t s purpose. A nuc-
leus of enthusiasts now exists, and with mere
experience (and money) r. very active olub
should be b u i l t up i n the next year to two.

CRICKET CLIMAX
Towards the end of the summer term,
with examination worries a thing of the
past, the I.C. team played some b r i l l i a n t
cricket. Exciting victories were gained
over U.C. and Eastcote C. C , each i n the
last over, and King's- were held to a draw.
The match against the team of old students,
led by the notorious F.G. Davies, resulted
for the f i r s t time i n a win f o r the o l d
lags and proved a memorable social occasion
in addition to a fine match. At the end
of the term the team, s l i g h t l y depleted,
l e f t for an invasion of Devon and performed
very well on some occasions, not so well on
others!
I. C. batted f i r s t i n the o l d student's
match (once the old students had been ex-
tracted from the Red Lion), and made 205-8
dec. Bhatti made 47 and Kitohener was bow-
led f o r 46 by Dan Eastland, who, i n his day
had been, l i k e hiss victim President of
I.C. The old lags passed this t o t a l f o r
the loss of 7 wickets, Graham Eastland
making 83.
In a high scoring match with U.C.,
I.C. were set to make 181 i n 2 i hrs., and
achieved t h e i r goal without being unduly
pressed i n the last over. Shepherd (46),
Bhatti (47 not out), and Kitohener (80 not
out) being mainly responsible. They were
set a similar task by Eastcote i n the next
match, and steadier bowling l e f t them 107
s t i l l to get i n the last hour and 75 i n the
last 25 minutes. After a spell of a l l -
out attack four were s t i l l required when
the last over began. Kitchener (67) was
run out. off the second b a l l and Whiddon
strode i n with 2 wanted. He rose to the
occasion by playing his finest innings of
the season, and returned to the pavilion
triumphant, 2 not out, amidst scenes of
great enthusiasm. Bhatti made 79 not cut.
Dytham found that he had almost chewed his
finger nails off.
So to Devon, where, for the f i r s t few
days, a reaction seemed to set i n i The R.N.
Engineering College, one of the strongest
teams i n Devon last summer, were dismissed
for 215, thanks mainly to Hearn (5 for 61)
but after a f a i r start I.C. oollapsed and
made only 103 (Bhatti 37). Tho following
day against the R«N. Barracks, Kapur made
a b r i l l i a n t 57 which was a firm foundation
to I.C.'s.total of 142, but this proved i n -
adequate and the Barracks won by 6 wickets.
After an undistinguished draw with tha
Plymouth Police (but a r i o t of entertainment
in the Police Station afterwards) I.C. pre-
sented Whimple with a new b a l l and were
bowled out with i t for 101. Stumps are
drawn at Whimple when the ohurch b e l l s
begin to ring, but on this occasion, with
Whimple requiring only one for victory,
this rule was overlooked and Whimple beat
I.C., for the f i r s t time since 1951, by 3
wickets. C. Pearoe scored 20 and took 2
for 13.

This brought a revival i n the I.C.
fortunes and easy victories were gained
over the Marines at Lymp3tone where Bhatti
took 6-31 and Brixham, who were put out
for 45 (Shilling 4-235. Against Exmouth
I.C. r e a l l y got back into their stride,
and despite P. Davies' farcical running
between wickets made 158-9 dec.
(Kitchener 81 n.o.). A laughable i n -
cident during this innings came when
B. Heam glared at the local umpire and
soowled at a l l and sundry during his
march pavilicjjjrards, after being given out
1> B w off a b a l l which would have removed
the middle stump. S p i r i t s thus: ran high f o r
the annual olaah with Torquay, but this ,
the last match of the tour, was. rained o f f p
a great disappointment.
Altogether I.C. had a very jooessfttl
season, with moments of unprecedented
greatness, which might have occurred more
often i n the t a i l had not been so long.
On and off the f i e l d a fine team s p i r i t was
apparent, and some extraordinary events
took place on the tour, notably when week-
end v i s i t o r D. Harrhy mistook a coal-
shute f o r the front door of our hostelry.
His body was recovered after an hour's
hard labour, and being found to exhibit
symtoms of l i f e , was put to bed.
Freshers who hope to participate i n
this great college institution should avoid
making any engagements f o r the 2 weeks
immediately following the summer term.
