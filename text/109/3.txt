DRAM. SOC. PRFSENT WHILE THE SUN SHINES
"««>• **oa Aot 2, in which three of the characters in the piny (Peter U»s-«,
nek Saunders, Terence Wright) struggle for possesion of the phone in order to
plead their loves for the leading lady.
Per the f i r s t week of July the College
Dramatic Society presented "While the Sua
Shines* at the Civic Theatre, Bedford (Town
not College). The play i s essentially a
period piece, painted with the colours of
austerity and the a l l i e l forces during the
l a s t war.
I t M " * Terry Wright as Colbert, a Free-
Prenoh o f f i c e r , gave the best performance -
with the r i g h t intensity of emotion. Peter
Morgan, as an American A i r Force Lieutenant,
waltzed competently into h i s part with a
alow drawl. Rosemary M e l v i l l e , to quote f r -
om the "BEDFORD EBOOfiD". "a completely true
t o l i f e Kensington Vamp, firmly established
the memorable H M "you DON'T marry Amer-
icans", and established herself as an actress.
As f o r the rest of the oast, the
general standard was good. Dick Sau-
nders played Lord Harpenden, Able-
Seaman R.N., with occasional lapses into
scmevhat unlordly bearing even f o r an
able-seaman. Susan Cocmbes, as Lady
Elizabeth, W.A.A.F., gave a convincing
performance. Dave G r i f f i n blustered In
his usual manner to quite good effect.
The production was, on the whole good,
but despite copious advertising the sun
shone and audiences were poor. The tour
was, however, very good experience and
very enjoyable. At the r i s k of being t r i t e
I would conclude that the Sun Shone f o r
better and f a r worse.

Dear Fresher,
As the senior active member of the
Felix Board i t behoves me to write a few,
probably d i s t a s t e f u l , words of advice on
thejapaaaioa of your reception into our
foJBF Woaa
are not the only words of
advrfte you w i l l receive, aa by now you
w i l l no doubt have realised.
F i r s t I must d i s i l l u s i o n you. I t is
unlikely that you are about to receive a
'university eduoatioai'. Imperial College
i s l i t t l e more than part of the university
by name alone; moat of I t s departments
represent l i t t l e more than a s c i e n t i f i c and
technological 'cramming school'.
In moat cases the taxpayer or the rate-
payer i s providing the money f o r you to
come here, because they have been told
that the Country needs scientists sad
technologists. You are therefore under an
obligation to become well-qualified in
your chosen profession. In due course
quite a few of you will realise that you
have ohoaen the wrong profession; you
will disappear from our midst without
graduating. It i s . In any oase, a policy
of the College to take more people Into the
first year than oan be accomodated in the
third year, for this reason.
Tou will not learn to accept responsi-
bility in the lecture theatre or In the
laboratory. In these two places you will
be spoon-fed. tou will obtain no practice
in asking important decisions, and l i t t l e
ohanoe of learning how to 'get on' with
your fellows and to 'handle people'.
Very few of you already possess these
quailtiea in adequate amount, unless you
have been in the Services. Tou must look
elsewhere than your course and the seclusion
of your lodgings for this part of your
training.
Xes, you have earns here to work, and
unless the selection system has erred, you
have come to do your beet. In ay experience
thine is no truer sapias; than that what you
put into a project ia a direct measure of
the value eventually obtained from i t . Let
us therefore consider xhat i t ia that you
wish to obtain fron your stay bare. Tour
ambition i s to hold down a well rcmaeratcd
Job whioh oarriee responsibility for men
and materials; a Job in which you are
respected as an able aeabar of your pro-
fession, and one in whioh you have the
opportunity to he an individual, i f you
are prepared Just to he a scientific or
technological brain used and 'pushed around'
by others who carry the responsibility and
make the decisions, you have no right to be
at Imperial College.
I suggest that the only way by whioh
you w i l l become a man instead of a moron
i s by mingling with your fellows on the
social and sporting levels. Participate
i n the College social and athletic clubs.
Have a natter with your friends over a drink
i n the bar. Go to Dinner-in-Hall now and
again to meet some of the more senior
members of the College. Mix with people
i n other departments and people i n other
'yeare'.
But, you are here to work, to study.
Striking a balance between work and play l a
a very individual matter; one i n whioh no-
body but yourself oan deoide. Your work
and play should give each other mutual
assistance: both should help you i n your
preparation for your career.
In conclusion hare i s a piece of
advioe which many of ray contemporaries
would appear to dispute. In my opinion
your attitude, particularly where examin-
ations are concerned, should not arise
froa the idea of either passing or f a l l -
ing, getting a ' f l r c t ' or a 'second'.
Tour attitude should be one of intention
to do better than your fellovc.
Yours sincerely,
Hubert Edsuln S-nith
