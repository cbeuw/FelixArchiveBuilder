John Donald Chadwick, President,
Imperial College.
Particularly appropriate f o r a year
i n which the average age of Onion members
reaches a new low, this year's President,
John Chadwick, i s the youngest to f i l l this
office for many years. He was bom i n
Bolton i n 1935 and was educated at Boltom
School.
'Chad' entered Guilds i n October '53.
He i s now a post-graduate i n the lubrication
laboratories of the Mech. Eng. department.
In h i s last academic year he was Vice-
President of Guilds. 'Chad', unlike the
last three presidents,is a Boat Club man,
he stroked the F i r s t VIII i n '56. His
popularity, however, unlike so many Union
o f f i c i a l s i n the past, i s not based upon
his sporting prowess. Newcomers to the
College w i l l f i n d a readily approachable
and unassuming friend who has the interests
of the Union members at heart.
As a guide to P r e s i d e n t i a l ^ o l i o y i n
the coming session, i t i s worth noting that
Chad says he feels somewhat worried about
the situation which has arisen through the
self-deception of Imperial College students
into thinking that they and their
contemporaries at this mecca of technology
should not take part i n any extramural
a c t i v i t i e s that may be olassed as creative.
He considers that this i s a l l too apparent
i n the number that actively contribute to
those aspects of Union affairs which are
not directly recreative. Chad i s a man
who practices what he preaches.
/.CMAS POINT OF VIEW
Who brightens up a rlni i and rainy day
with a warm smile? Who i s well-dressed?
Who does not oome into lectures with a
growth of beard on the face, varying i n
length from a day to a week? Who pours
water on certain unarmed but deserving
heads? - but, who i s NOT w i l l i n g to brew
coffee at a l l hours of day and night?
Tes, you're right every time i t i s
I.C.W.A. - that small band of unspoiled
womanhood who understands, mothers and tends
a l l those l o s t sheep (including navy black
ones) who come to them for shelter. I.C.
W.A. are those virtuous young ladies whom
you oan see from time to time, gracing the
precincts of the College. How often have
you spurned them and turned to less worthy
females? When the awakening comes to you
you w i l l realise that nowhere else perf-
ection l i e s except i n I.C.W.A.
FRESHERS WELCOME
Welcome fresher, woloome s l l .
For once again loud feet do f a l l
Upon our noble college floors
And once again you bang the doors.
Today at last we do return
After this our long sojourn
Of Summer Vac, and journeys f a r ,
And v i s i t soon the friendly bar.
A couple here, a small group there,
Recount the tales they cannot bear
To leave untold another day;
The stories of t h e i r latest fray.
Amidst this crowd the fresher moves
And thinks at l a s t of many loves,
Of Soccer, Rugger, Jive and Squash
With which he hopes to out a dash.
Now of the many there w i l l be a few
Who think that everything i s now
And se they hlsze some fresh rwr waya
With whioh to f i l l t h e i r leisure days.
But soon,alas,they often f i n d
That s l l the pleasures of the mind
Can force outside the time to learn
Into the hours when candles bum.
Do not forget, C readers s l l .
Those shimmerings i n the crystal b a l l ;
That onos a year you must defend
The rights you have to comprehend.

THE SPANNER TRAIL
A Fable by D.F. Butters.
Happening on a large wooden spanner a
few weeks ago, the R.C.S. man realised that
i t was not properly looked after and, as he
was a good natured ohap he removed i t for
safekeeping and deposited i t im the l e f t -
luggage office of a London terminus. How-
ever, finding himself i n possession of an
incriminating document, to wit, the ticket,
he decided that t h i s should also be looked
after carefully, so he put i t i n a parcel
which he l e f t at another London: terminus.
But inevitably he found nimself i n the unen-
viable position! of having yet another ticket,
just as dangerous as the f i r s t . Have you
ever t r i e d to get r i d of a fly-paper i n -
advertently grasped instead of a l i g h t card?
I doubt i t , but perhaps you get an inkling of
his p a n i c He rushed wildly from terminus
to terminus trying to r i d himself of the para
s i t l o ticket. His good nature l e f t hiir.
Cynical and embittered, the parcels
became more and more l e t h a l . Instead of a
bottle of beer and a packet of crisps, he
used noxious chemicals and was i n the
process of making a time-bomb to end the
t r i a l when he thought of the Unionv
Gratefully he thrust the current ticket at
the astonished R.C.S. President who. was i n
complete ignorance of tlie whole a f f a i r
having just l e f t his noxious chemical labora-
tory. Naturally this good natured ohap gav*
the ticket with a l l haste to Dave Stevens,
who, no doubt realising that charges are
high these days, l e f t the Uniom hurriedly.
He w i l l no doubt give details of the hunt.
