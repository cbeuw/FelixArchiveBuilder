THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
It i s with great pleasure and r e l i e f
that I am able to welcome the freshmen; and
present students baok after the vacation t o
a building that i s ready t o receive them.
A l l work that was planned f o r the vacation
has been completed, excepting the Gymnasium
whioh suffered the setback of seemingly i n -
evitable administrative procrastination.
New sofas have been i n s t a l l e d i n the Lounge,
and the excess furniture has been d i s t r i b -
uted around the Union building. The session
begins with the advantage over the l a s t few
years of being more than ever suitable for
our a c t i v i t i e s .
Now that the building i s complete i t
i s i t s use that merits mention. The now
extinct House Committee, i n a report pre-
sented t o the Union last year, put forward
various recommendations f o r the conduct of
those using the building . Those were ad-
opted with acclamation and a copy appeared
on the Union notioe board. Some students,
one hopes from ignorance rather than malice,
did not follow the Union decisions. Uni.cn
officers are not policeman, and do not
wish t o appear so; the responsibility rests
on each and every Union member t o obey the
rul.es his Union has made.
It i s very important to realise that
the Union and a l l i t s f a c i l i t i e s are not
just another of the amenities that are
provided for students at Imperial College.
The Union i s provided by the members
for the members. Anyone with useful
suggestions or criticisms should
approach the appropriate student off-
icer either personally or i n writing.
He w i l l be f a i l i n g i n his duty I f the
serious suggestions are not f u l l y inves-
tigated.
The Union i s for the members and I
urge you t o take a l l advantage of i t
and use i t .

KARA KORAM EXPEDITION
A l e t t e r has been received from Karakoram
Expedition now i n the Himalayas, reporting
that a l l i a going well. I n i t i a l l y the party
suffered from a series of headaches induced
by the altitude,butthlahas not hampered
t h e i r work i n surveying the Siachen Glacier.
In July the Expedition was delayed seven-
teen days due t o shipping d i f f i c u l t i e s . To
compensate f o r t h i s members of the exped-
i t i o n w i l l leave l a t e r than had been planned.
In fact, they have only one quarter of the
time needed t o make a complete survey of this
area. Apart from the somewhat monotonous
diet during their stay i n Tndla everyone i s
now contented.
I t i s worth mentioning that the
b u l l e t i n came one hundred and sixty miles
serosa f a i r l y d i f f i c u l t country t o the Post
Office a t Skardu, which gives some indication
of the vastness of the area i n which they are
working, A f u l l e r report w i l l be appearing
i n F S L H when the expedition returns.
THE MILLERHORN
I.C. IN NORWAY
On July 1st. four members of Imperial
College, Dave Baxter, Pat Pavkes, Mike
Gorb and Tony Hodgson, l e f t London for
Arctic Norway to carry out mountaineering
exploration round Altevaten, close to the
Swedish border. Although the area had
been surveyed during the war, i t s moun-
taineering p o s s i b i l i t i e s were s t i l l un-
known.
Within a week the party had set up a
base camp at the western end of the lake,
and by July 11th. i t was within s t r i k i n g
distance of the mountains. After only a
few days ^limbing and surveying i t was clear
from the views seen while on Kirkestund
(5120ft) and Maddanipa (4900ft) that the
neighbouring mountains had not much t o
offer to the mountaineer; the few rook
faces that were i n evidence were badly
weathered. I t was decided, therefore, to
move base camp further westwards to ju3t
north of Bardu, where the country looked
mare promising.
However, the part was deprived of
the opportunity of exploring t h i s region
as, on July 16th. Tony Hodgson f e l l some
50ft. while abseiling and was seriously
injured. 30 hours l a t e r he was admitted to
Narvik hospital. With the number thus
depleted i t was decided that further survey-
ing i n the area would not be possible, and
so a fortnight l a t e r another base camp had
been established near the S t o r s t e i n a f J i l l
massif 25 miles from Narvik, with a high
camp on a glacier to the south. A further
disappointment was then experienced due t o
the bad weather which kept the party tent-
bound for several days.
Nevertheless, during the remaining 3
weeks some good climbing was had on both
rook and i c e , with an adventurous crossing
of an i o e f a l l on Kuinaookka. Two prob-
able f i r s t ascents were made; the Stcrtuod
Ridge and an unmarked â€¢bump" marked 1367 m,
while other oliirba included Ippovarre,
Kninarookka and Nikkiookka. The laat tvo
days were spent on S t o r s t e i n s f J i l l where
the three members of the party were con-
fined t o their tio-man tent while a b l i s -
s j r d raged outside.
I t was with mixed feelings that on the
22nd. August the party retreated from
StorsteinafJ i l l ; diaappointmsnt i n that
l i t t l e had been achieved i n 6 wsfeks, but &
sense of well-being after such a long period
among the mountains auay from c i v i l i s a t i o n .
