SOCC£R
This season the soccer club w i l l run
four teams regularly, a l l with commitments
i n the University League, with a possible
f i f t h team i f there i s enough support.
Although the club has a high standing
i n intercollegiate football, no trophies
have been won f o r many years nowc This
season the 1st. XI should be capable of
winning at least one of the competitions,
i f the team play with understanding and
with t a c t i c a l s k i l l . I s t . XI players are
therefore expected to support a training
programme which i s being organised.
Players from lower teams, which Lave im-
proved fixtures, are welcome i f practicable.
Apart from this serious side of the
3port there i s a social side which has been
neglected i n the past, and players should
make every effort to entertain v i s i t i n g
teams etc. A l l are invited to the t r i a l s
on (tot 2nd. and Oct 5th. (free ocaohesl)..
The club w i l l endeavour to make a just
selection from the talent shown at these
t r i a l s but any person who thinks he merits
a position i n a higher team than for which
he was selected must be patient, for after
a few matches the situation should be r e -
solved.
IMPERIAL COLLEGE CHRISTIAN

London Inter-Faculty Christian Union (L.I.

We meet regularly for prayer and Bible
study, and have an open meeting every
Monday lunch-time (at which sandwiches may
be purchased). At these Monday meetings,
well qualified outside speakers present the
basic end essential facts of the Christian
gospel, i n a clear and straightforward
manner. A l l these meetings are advertised

services.
We would l i k e to wish a l l Freshers a
happy and successful stay at I.C., and also
suggest that now i s the time for you to
think seriously about the Christian faith,
i f you have not done so already. We believe
i t to be the most important thing i n l i f e .

MOUNTAINEERING CLUB
ALPINE MEET SUMMER IIS 7
Seven members of the Club met at
Chsmcnix on July 2nd., two of them
having travelled from London by motor
cycle. The f o l i c wing five and a half weeks
were spent i n the mountains, l i v i n g i n
the huts c f the French Alpine Club.
Having f i r s t spent a day i n Argentiere
buying food (whioh later resulted i n large
quantities of starch being prepared under
the impression that dehydrated potatoes had
been bought), the next day saw the party
making i t s way up to the Argentiere hut
and having their f i r s t sight of the great
peaks i n the area. A day was then spent
practising Alpine technique on snow and ioe -
only two of the party had climbed i n the
Alps before. (Six experienced I.C. mount-
aineers were on the Karakoram Expedition).
Climbing then began i n earnest with the
traverse with the Tour Noil'.
Throe days l a t e r , fron the Albert Hut,
the party undertook a long and "quite d i f -
f i c u l t " route across the glacier to the
Forbes arete of the A i g u i l l e de Chardonnet
which i s a classic among Alpine climbs and
involves about twelve hours of sustained
olimbing on rook and steep snow and i c e
slopes. At the summit the weather was so
fine and the a i r so olear that the Matter-
horn could be seen to the East almost 50
miles away, and to the South through a heat
haze, ths valleys of Italy were seen. The
two experienced members also climbed the
Aiguille du Tour on the fallowing day.
The Qouverole Hut was reached after a>
very wet and cold day's crossing of the
Her de Glace. The next few days saw a
deterioration i n the weather. The only good
day was spent on the Aiguille de Moine whioh
was olimbed by the Southwest Arete - a long;
rock ridge of average standard. The scenery
an this route was magnificent with Mont
Blanc only about three miles away, and del-
icate rock tracery of the Chamonix Aig-
u i l l e s only just across the valley.
This was the last olimb, however,
because even on the descent from the Koine
ths clouds were banking up. After two i d l y
spent days i t was decided to pack up and
come home. The party had enjoyed their t r i p ;
had learnt new olimbing techniques, and
"had a lot of fun".
Incidentally, before journeying home,
the tuo motorcyclists had to recover their
machine from the police - who olaimed that
i t had been abandoned.
R. C.S. MOTOR CLUB
SIL VER S TONE OUTING
On June 15th., 'Jezebel' accompanied
by a ore* of 9, attended the IT.S.C.C.
meeting at Silverstone, where she was
placed i n ths paddock and attracted con-
siderable attention, and admiration. The
Journey of 120 miles, her farthest since
she was Drought up from Jarrington was
accomplished vithout incident, but with
a prodigious consumption, of petrol. To
honour the suspension and ths b i g ends,
speed was kept telow 25 m.p.h. I t i s
hoped that the outing.will become an annual
one.
SAI LING
members of I.C.S.C. competed at most
of the open meetings with events f o r F i r e -
f l y * held on the south coast during the
stnser.
About twelve L.C. sailors entered
marine week held this year at Berne Bay
during the second week of July. Strong
winds and waves provided exhillarating
s a i l i n g for helmsmen used to the oalm
waters of the Welsh Harp.
I.C. helmsmen had great success i n
the F i r e f l y Single Handed Championships
at Herne Bay during August. J.M. Conway-
Janes finished f i r s t but was disqualified
for a technical Infringement cf the rules
and J.E. Smith gained t h i r d place.
National F i r e f l y Week at Southend
was a disappointment. Leeshere gales
caused the cancellation of racing on
four out of seven daysc The p r i c i p a l
event for the S i r Ralph Gore trophy was
sailed ovjr five laps of the triangular
course over the mudflats upriver from the
pier. In bad weather half of the fleet
oapsised, M. Collyer In Fumble, 1325, oap-
sised before the start but raced and finished
very creditably i n fourth place; beating
a l l other university and college entries.
There were only two entries for Chich-
ester Harbour Week with I.C. connections.
The Storey cup vas raced for i n force s i x
wind on August 26th. and only eight boats
competed the course. M. Collyer arrived
only ten minutes before the start, entered
and finished fourth, his placing being some-
what affected Ly ignorance of the course.
The very l i g h t winds during the rest of the
week favoured sailors with intimate know-
ledge of the channels, t i d a l streams, and
mud banks i n the harbour.
At Medway regatta on September l s t .
champion Castaway, Conway Jones again
took f i r s t prise and M. Collyer appeared
in his usual position, 4th. i n the prooas
s i on acres a the finishing l i n e .
The dinghys have new x-etumed to the
Harp, having made a h i t i n a quiet London
suburb, where one householder remarked to
his wife that there were five beats i n
the road. The d i s t r i c t not being prone
to flooding, this evoked the reply -
"NonsenseI you're seeing things."
