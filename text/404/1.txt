Wilson renames
Physics building
Last Wednesday evening marked the occasion of the
re-naming of the Physics building by the Prime Minister,
Mr Harold Wilson. The Physics building will now be known
as the 'Blackett Laboratory' in commemoration of Lord
Blackett former Fellow of Imperial College, who died
last year.
Mr Wilson w a s asked to
attend the ceremony and give
the memorial lecture because
he had been a long standing
friend of Lord B l a c k e t t .
Pat Blackett fought in
World War 1 as a naval officer
and w a s at Jutland when he
was only 19. Between the
Wars he worked with Rutherford
when the foundations of
nuclear and atomic physics
were laid. In World War 2, he
an original " b o f f i n " working
in the early days of Operational
Research.
After the War he became
involved in what he c a l l e d ,
the "interface between
Science and Technology and
Productive Industry." He
was appointed to the newly
set up N R D C by a young
Harold Wilson and it w a s
from this time that they grew
to know each other w e l l .
B l a c k e t f ' s a p p o i n t m e n t
caused controversy at the
time. H e held unorthodox
v i e w s on World affairs,
including questions on
nuclear power and the need
.for co-operation with the
Soviet Union and other
countries to avoid the d i v i s i o n
of the World into major
nuclear power b l o c k s . He
was awarded, in 1948, the
Nobel prize for P h y s i c s .
Pat Blackett served in the
N R D C from 1 9 4 9 - 6 4 during
which time the N R D C w a s
built up into the large,
successful, profit-making,
organisation that it i s today.
In 1953, Lord Blackett
joined IC, and w a s head of

the P h y s i c s Department until
1963, building up the Depart-
ment and playing a major
role in the expansion of
Imperial C o l l e g e . With others,
including G a i t s k i l l , A l f
Robens and Brownowski,
during the 13 years of Labour
opposition, he helped form
p o l i c i e s which after the '64
election became Labour's
"white-hot technological
r e v o l u t i o n " .
In the capacity of advisor
to s u c c e s s i v e Ministers of
Technology, Frank Cousens
and Tony Benn, Pat Blackett
became the saviour of the
B r i t i s h computer industry,
mainly through protectionism.
(This policy would to-day
be forbidden by the E E C ) .
A champion of egalitarianism,
Pat Blackett declined an
invitation to go to the L o r d ' s
in the early s i x t i e s , but
was finally persuaded to
become a life peer in 1969.
From Mr W i l s o n ' s lecture,
Pat Blackett appeared with
warmtn as an idealist, but
a l s o as intensely p r a c t i c a l .
He played a central role in
the move during the 6 0 ' s ,
toward more t e c h n i c a l l y
knowledgable management
and the end of " a m a t e u r i s m " .
He was born in 1897, h i s
life covered the development
of practically a l l of modern
science, indeed he helped
shape much of it. A man who
spent many years breaking
down separatism, throughout
he had the prime virtue of the
S c i e n t i s t , on impeceable
intellectual honesty.

COPY D A T E
Monday 8th D e c . A l l copy
to reach the F E L I X office
J O G R I M O N D , former L i b e r a l
Party Leader, spoke yesterday
of the great divide between
the Government, i n the form
of the . different k i n d s o f
authority, and the people
of B r i t a i n .
Mr Grimond, who i s a
member * of Parliament for
Orkney and Shetland, visited
the C o l l e g e at the invitation
of the Liberal C l u b . He
gave vent to h i s personal
v i e w s on the present state
of British p o l i t i c s . He saw
the present turbu lance as
a chance for a new beginning
for our whole governmental
system. There w a s , he s a i d ,
an opportunity for a complete
re-think of our institutions,
from the C i v i l Service through
Industry to U n i v e r s i t i e s
and Government.
Mr Grimond who favours
devolution of power to the
new Welsh and Scottish
assemblies wanted this
trend carried further. Services
such as education he thought
could be m a n a g e d by
communities rather than by
local authorities and central
government.
In what amounted to a
power to the people speech,
Mr Grimond said that t h e
political arena consisted of
power blocks and pressure
groups rather than parties
representing sectional interests.
T h i s w a s more akin to the
situation that existed in
medieval times and he called
for a new look at the ways
in which our p o l i c i e s were
being formulated.
