CROSS C O U N T R Y C H R O N I C L E S
L A S T W E E K was the big
test of fitness for the C r o s s
Country Club, with- two
league matches arranged
within a space of four days.
In preparation we a l l eased
down for these events, B i g
Rob cutting h i s training from
60 miles per week and the
rest of us from 60 pints per
week.
The first match w a s the
London Colleges League
held on Wednesday 19th in
the mud of Parliament H i l l
F i e l d s . Our turn out was
excellent, Imperial contributing
16 fine athletes to a field of
over 100. After the initial
sprint the field settled down
into their usual positions with
the young hopefuls and the
rest of us plodding along a
little in front/ behind (delete
as appropriate) the main
pack. On this occasion the
first team really pulled their
tingers out and we managed
to finish (5 runners) in the
first 15 places: Rob A l l i n s o n
3rd. Ian E l l i s 6 t h , Steve
Webb 11th, Paul C l a r k e 14th,
Dave Rosen 15th
The second team was lead
home by A l f Gamett (31st),
who it seems has now
completely recovered from
his twisted ankle and c a n
therefore no longer beat the
first team! Y e t again our
second team was complete,
but unfortunately the 3rd
team w a s not, but finished
off in traditional style with
good packing at the back
from our new stars C o l i n Dale
(89th) and Martin Tarnowski
(90th).
The 2nd league match w a s
the Courages (as in beer) at
Bath on Saturday 22nd.
F i t n e s s w a s telling at this
stage and only 8 runners
braved the frost to arrive
at the Union for a 10.00am
(well almost) start. 100
miles and one p l a s t i c motor-
way cafe later we arrived at
Bath in time to walk around
the course before the race.
It was a pity however that
we didn't take Paul C l a r k e
on the jaunt, because at the
c r i t i c a l time he couldn't
find the start! (Orienteers
note — don't invite P a u l along
to your fixtures, h e ' l l take
all day to find the first
check point.) B y the time
Paul found the start the
back markers had at least a
100 metres start on him, but
not dispirited by the sight
of the race disappearing
over the horizon Paul set off
in pursuit and managed to
come 106th in a field of
nearly 200.
A s usual Rob w a s battling
it out again at the front but
due to abdominal problems in
the last mile could only
manage 4th place. The rest
of the team d i d not, however
perform up to the standards
of the previous Wednesday,
and the placings stretched
we 1
1 over 100.
The moral of this story
is that if we try hard and do
(too) well in a league we
should w i n this year (injuries
permitting), but we don't
seem to get such a good
turnout, or good results for
the higher standard Courages'
League. I think a shift of
emphasis is needed.
T H E A N N U A L T R I P to Potters
Bar last Wednesday almost
failed to start due to a.c.u.
by the organisation. T h e
result of this w a s that the
few stalwarts brave enough
to run over the course,
accompanied the IC 1st X V
on their coach to the Royal
Vets College.
Once there, and like a bad
Western film, we stood
especting the cavalry in the
form of R o b , Steve and P a u l
to arrive, but l i k e Godot ...
The course consisted of a
mixture of deep s t i c k y clay
ploughed fields, some road
and golf courses. The result
was a w i n for the Royal Vets,
achieving this with some
good packing and well timed
bursts of speed, one of which
removed Ian E l l i s ' s chances
of winning w h i l s t he w a s
looking the other w a y .
A s p e c i a l mention for Mr
A . Davey who d i d not finish
the run because he returned
a dog he had lured away from
its home. A new excuse we a s k ?
On Saturday Rob A l l i n s o n
once again showed h i s
excellent form by beating
Mick F u l l e r and coming close
to winning the race against
Hercules Wimbledon and the
Bank of England.- A s expected
the result w a s a w i n for
Hercules, but with some
solid running from Ian E
Dave J and Steve W, we beat
the Bank by 57pts to 83pts.
A fine run by R i c h
Harrington puts h i m within
distance of a first team place,
but Andy Davey needs some
training i n course-finding,
(he got lost, again.)
S W I M M I N G S E N S A T I O N
by Andy Smith
T H E F I N A L of the U L U
Swimming Championships
were held this year on Wed
26th November. T h e IC
contingent having s u c c e s s f u l l y
battled through most of the
heats, once again braved the
Icy stretches of the Malet
St pool.
The first event was the
diving which turned out to
be I C ' s best event. Our
two ' a r t i s t e s ' gained first
and second place, there
being no other entrants.
After a very keenly fought
contest Rory L e w i s just
pipped Andy Smith by 10
points or s o , with both divers
attempting four straight dives
from the lowest board (almost
managing them).
Having been given such
an encouraging start the IC
swimmers then proceeded to
dominate the mens events.
N i c k Hurley swam a fine
individual medley to finish
third, with Andy fifth. In the
440 yards freestyle Rory
gained a comfortable second
place with Dave Lowther not
so comfortably fifth. In the
blue ribbon event, the 110
yards freestyle, Rory just
managed to hold on to h i s
title, despite a very strong
challenge from E l s t o n of
K i n g s ' and our own P a u l
F r i e z e (still going after a l l
these years). T h e 220 yards
breaststroke saw Andy coasting
in fourth, while the 110
yards backstroke produced
a good swim from Ian Shott
to finish third with Rory
in a c l a s s of h i s own in
fifth place. The final individual
event w a s the 110 yards
butterfly in which both Andy
and Dave completed the
course and finished third
and fifth respectively.
Against strong opposition
the medley team of Ian,
C o l i n Dale, Andy and Rory
was beaten into third place,
but amends were made In
the freestyle relay with
Rory, Dave, Andy and Paul
thrashing a l l in sight to
win by almost half a length.
When the points were,
added up, IC emerged clear
winners in the mens section,
and even without a single
female competitor were third
overall behind Kings and Barts.
On the water polo front,
IC first team entertained
Oxford University on Friday
28th N o v and thrashed them
10—3, goals coming from
N i c k Hurley, Rory L e w i s
and even Dave Lowther. A
busy week w a s then concluded
by IC second team playing
Bra'cknell second team in the
first round of the Winter
Handicap K O . Both teams
started with s i x goals
handicap and the match
finished at twenty goals to
thirteen in I C ' s favour.
Goals (seven) and noise
were supplied by M i k e
McCartney.

Imperial College 4 Royal Holloway 1
P R I D I N G O U R S E L V E S on
getting off the bus at the
correct stop, we arrived at
H a r l i n g t o n (before the
opposition I!...Just!) only to
find that Janet (see my name
in F E L I X Coxage w a s absent.)
T h i s meant that John Huckle
didn't umpire or write the report
Superior s k i l l , fitness,
team spirit and the crippling
of the opposition gave us an
easy victory. Mr Incontinence
missed chances galore but
was lucky enough to score
four (one after a shot from the
team's Drag A r t i s t that
wouldn't have caused a ripple
on a pool of B a t ' s P * * * l )
A s usual, the main events
of the day took place in the
bar. Sarah " B i t e s yer l e g s "
Horn, being only a little girl,
had a beer shampoo. J i m
Marshall discovered that
playing for the mixed team is
worse than going on the Stoat's
run, and Kim Houlden proved
that (whatever he has got) he
ain't got rhythm.
Those taking part in the
day's entertainments were:
Rae Mackay, John Huckle,
Jim Marshall, Sarah James,
Dave Balderson, Kim Houlden,
Ruth White, Jane Dracott, Sig
Golding, Chas Hardy, Sarah
Horn, Mr White and Mr Arthur
Loveday (who would not
procrastinate further).
Imperial College 2 Bank of England 3rd 2
WE KNOW now why the
country is in financial trouble,
Young's bitter i s only 16p
a pint at the Bank of England
sports Ground!
The quality of the hockey
was not devalued by the
prescence of second team
players in the third although
we were one down after five
minutes. Dave C a r l i l e and
Ramesh F a t a n i a put the goals
in before half time to give us
a deserved lead.
Early in the second half
the Bank scored a quick goal
and subsequently managed to
hold off our repeated attacks.
We were worth a win but cheap
beer and a good sing on the
coach made the trip most
worthwhile.
