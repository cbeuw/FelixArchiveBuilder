blank.
Our first match against
Portsmouth proved to be
rather unfortunate. The
lanes at Heathrow have
numerous familiar ruts in
them while Portsmouth's
lanes were superbly dressed
and as most of use are
untechnical 'chuqkers' they
came a s rather a surprise,
•with b a l l s wandering all
over the lanes. The away
-matches against Southampton
•and Brunei were a similar
story with most teams going
down by over 100 pins a
game. Only the ladies were
able to take a game from
Southampton. In the
league averages give witness
to the fact that our standards
are much higher than our
match results would suggest.
Unfortunately we always
seem to bowl disastrously
in these matches. Perhaps
this is due to the very relaxed
atmosphere on Wednesday, a
situation which rarely arises
oo- matches, or perhaps i t ' s
not that we are bad but the
oppositjon_are ajwavs better.
IC tenpin bowling club
has changed quite markedly
this year, with IC and U C
joining to form a University
of London team. T h i s 'has
mainly been due to U C losing
most of their members and
their joining our league.
What U C lack in numbers
however they make up for in-
quality, with Derek M i l l s ,
Sid Wright and John Bagalini
by Dave Zaborski
always able to command a
place in the first team.
T h i s year has a l s o been
notable in that for the first
time to my knowledge we
have had a contingent from
IF bowling at IC. Mansy,
J u l i e and Sue are regular
bowlers and we hope "in time
more of our members w i l l
come from I F . A l s o we have
been exceedingly fortunate
in getting a ladies captain in
form of Anne Holt who has
been consistently good
throughout the season.
Having been beaten 10—0
in a l l our matches vye resolved
to restore some lost face
against Brunei at home. The
first's and second's pushed
the opposition hard but lost
narrowly in all games.
Derek had a particularly good
match with a 500plus series
and a 198 third game. Rob,
raised from third's to f i r s t ' s ,
started with 180 but then
supped into our usual form.
Paul was spasmodic, C l i v e
bowled as usual and I was
getting a lot of practice at
s p l i t s . Apart from Derek we a l l
ended up with sub-450 series;
at least 50 too low for the
o c c a s i o n . John, A d r i a n , Cuff,
Roger and John all bowled
similarly in the s e c o n d ' s ,
w b o , with admirable team
work lost narrowly in 2 games.
The third's of Simon, Pete,
N i g e l , Paul and Steve took a
game but lost overall. The
ladies once again saved our
complete embarassment,
decked in our new shirts and
spurred mainly by a complete
d i s l i k e of. the opposition
they took 2 games, the
second by 4 pins which
pleased Brunei ladies no
end. Anne bowled . with-
admirable style curving the
ball into the head pin pocket
enough times to keep Brunei
worried. J u l i e and Briony in
similar style sent the ball
at a s n a i l s pace down the
lane and watched the pins
fall like the s o l d i e r s . Sue
regularly scored, but then
looked so surprised when
all the pins fell down. Mansy
simply bowled one immense
cutter, after another. A l l
the ladies raised their game
for the o c c a s i o n , regularily
picking up stray pins to keep
ahead of the opposition and
we finally won a point on
the U C T B A league. The
result 1-9, perhaps not good,
but improving.
I would like to thank the
ladies and a l s o anyone who
has regularily turned up for
matches, particularily the
reserves. I would a l s o like
to apologflse for consistently
bowling l i k e the captain.
If anyone would like to
come bowling next term,
novices as well as bowlers of
some experience, the coach
leaves from outside the union
at 2.30pm every Wednesday
all a l l are welcome.

'Saturday 29th November
and it's 12.30 in the afternoon.
Imperial C o l l e g e L a c r o s s e
club are at last leaving the
Beit Quadrangle, one player
short, to travel ddWn to Morden
to play St H e l i e r . The match is
a flags match, which is a
Knockoutcom pet it ion, analogous
to the F A C u p , but of a some-
what lower standard.
It is now 2.30 on Sunday
afternoon and this is what
happened. Well, London
Transport once again demon-
strated why they are viable
alternative to private transport
leaving us stranded o n
Stockwell tube station for
half an hour. We were therefore
about half an hour late arriving
at St H e l i e r . A t this juncture
we were asked, rather unsport-
inly, to concede for being
late. On refusing to do so we
were given a " C a t c h 2 2 "
proposition. If we played and
lost, the match stood, otherwise
St H e l i e r would c l a i m victory,
and report the game as a-
friendly. After a certain amount
of hassling we finally started
and played the match as a
'flags' match. In a l l fairness
to the Captain of St Helier, it
shou Id be said that he persona I ly
wanted to play the match, but
some of h is more'' profess iona I"
players weren't so keen.
Surprisingly the match
started in fairly good humour.
T h i s might possibly be due to
the fact that we conceded a
goal in the first minute. Being
a man up, St Helier had a
definite advantage, which
they used w e l l , leading 5—0
after the first quarter. F i n a l l y
our goalkeeper, Greasy Pete
MacDonald, settled and then
played like a demon. The
Defence a l s o worked hard
having to mark an extra man,
and thanks to a bit of luck and
good goal keeping, only gave
away one goal in the next
quarter, while the attack and
midfield, through Derek Senner,
scored for IC. The score at
half time was 6—1 to St Helier.
During the second half IC
again worked hard, b a s i c a l l y
trying to keep the opposition
score rate to a minimum,
while the attack attempted to

Bedford III 5
Imperial College V 0
T H E F I F T H S had the bad
luck of drawing Bedford III
in the first round of the cup,
they are unbeaten this season,
top of their d i v i s i o n and the
cup favourites.
In the first half, Bedford,
many of whose players
appeared to possess a mental
age of s i x , and sub-sere IQ
ratings, were surprised to
find Imperial werre not the
expected push-over. Their
failure to dominate the play
resulted in them over-
indulging in unsportsmanlike
t a c t i c s such as k i c k i n g Tom
Shanks as he lay writhing in
the mud.
The score at half-time
was' 1—0 but with Imperial
s t i l l fighting hard and looking
capable of snatching victory.
In the second half Bedford
began to put their game
together and as Imperials
defence and mid field tired,
they hammered In a further
four goals. Despite the
shoreline there was never
more than one goal between
the s i d e s . The only difference
between the teams being
Imperial's front runners
inability to c a p i t a l i s e on the
chances created by the hard
working midfield, whilst
Bedford (all credit to them),
took their chances when
they came, which is what
the game is a l l about. Bob
Baldock seemed to have
his mind on other things
such as " W a s there a mirror
in the changing r o o m ? " and
Rob Pavlov (Imperials'
Walter Mitty) failed to live
up to his pre-match forecast
of being G e o r g e Best
reincarnated.
After the match as Bedford
celebrated with double
rations of rusks and warm
milk, a ray of light shone
into the life of Kim Whaley
as the tea-girl actually spoke
to him (poor, deprived lad,
isn't used to such things).
take as many scoring chances
as possible. However, these
chances were few and far
between because of St H e l i e r ' s
one player advantage, which
meant they could always mark
the IC attack. S t i l l the " H a p p y
H a c k e r " did score from a solo
run, leaving the final score
10—2 in St H e l i e r ' s favour.
IC did very w e l l t o keep the
score as low as this against
a side who were relegated
from the d i v i s i o n above last
season ( and this only due to
difficulties in getting a squad.)
and a l s o .having a player
advantage. A n extra player on
IC's side would probably have
made this enjoyable and good
humoured (once started) and a
lot more even. Maybe one of
these days w e ' l l get a full
teem.
