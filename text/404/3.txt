FOR THOSE IN doubt,
possibly due to the abscence
of my column in the last few
editions of F E L I X , ICWA
has been alive and well
since I last put pen to
paper! Firstly, on the negative
side, I must explain why the
Rape Debate was cancelled.
The idea of the debate was to
encourage constructive and
objective discussion of the
present rape law and the
dileria that the law faces in
the case of rape. It was felt
that this could not possibly
happen in the justifiably
high pitched atmosphere
created by the rape of a girl
at knife point in the Union
Building, only a week before
the debate was due to have
taken place. Hence, the
debate was cancelled.
In the lunch break of
Thursday, November 20th,
ICWA held its first General
Meeting of the session. This
proved to be a tactical error*
as an ICU UGM was also
scheduled for that lunch
break. However, thanks to
the very poor turn out for
the meeting, we had no
trouble in whizzing through
the agenda, electing for
ourselves a very capable
freshers' rep and male rep
and still managing to attend
the major part of the UGM.
On the evening of the
20th November the Post
Graduate and Overseas
Students Social evening was
held from which insights
were gleaned as to just how
isolated some of these
students really are. As a
result we have devised a
strategy for ensuring every
one of our P G and overseas
members know about the
events being organised.
As for future events, we
propose to round off the
term in true Christmas spirit
with the 'traditional' ICWA
Christmas luncheon to be
held on December 9th in the
Union Concert Hall. Tickets
cost 50p and can be purchased
from ICWA department reps
or from Beit Hall, rooms 121,
124 and 30. We look forward
to seeing you there.
Finally, although College
goes down for the Christmas
vac on December 12th, most
schools and sixth form colleges
do not break up until much
later. This provides a ready
opportunity for students
to visit their old sixth
forms, with a view to giving
a short careers talk to
encourage girls to read
for science and engineering
degrees — particularly at
IC. It is not as awesome
as it sounds — most sixth
formers are more than willing
to listen to what you have to
say. If you are willing to do
this, and this request is by
no means restricted to ICWA
members, let me know so that
you can be provided with
some of the relevant bumph.
A better male/female ratio
in this college would benefit
both parties (did somebody
say a party ?!) So please give
the idea some consideration.

Women in science
and engineering
not a contradiction
The advantage of the
emotions is that they lead us
astray, and the advantage of
science is that it is not
emotional — Oscar Wilde.
WOMEN IN s c i e n c e and
engineering i s , to many
people, a contradiction in
terms. Either they are not
true women, or not true
s c i e n t i s t s arid engineers.
The first lesson you learn
when y o u decide to study
engineering i s how to react
when people discover this
intention. It is something I
have never mastered. When
people smile sweetly and
say, 'But y o u look much too
feminine to d o engineering!,
I generally pull myself up to
my full 5ft 2 i n s and glower
at them, or I smile sweetly
back and murmur, 'engineering
degrees aren't as p h y s i c a l l y
demanding as people imagine;
on a good day I c a n carry
my own books...'
The constant teasing i s
very worrying, e s p e c i a l l y
if you are not a good engineer.
Perhaps t h i s i s my whole
problem, but it certainly
irritates me greatly when
people suggest I am too short
to undertake the rigours of
a B S c (Eng).
It i s in connection with
M u t t e r s A r i s i n g
Still recovering from the
euphoria of a Mike Williams
(gasp) profile, I am afraid
this 'Mutters' w i l l not s o
much fly off the pen, as
stagger off it. There are
two things which need
saying.
F i r s t l y , a working party
on " w a y s in which the
U n i o n ' s administration c a n
be made more responsive to
the needs of the membership,
present- and future" has been
set-up. T h i s grand brief
encompasses an enormous
field, but if you feel that
the Union lets you down in
any sphere, be it in clubs,
academic affairs, accommod-
ation, or whatever, then let
us know.
The working party c o n s i s t s
of Peter Teague, R i z Shakir,
John Morgan and myself. If
you don't grumble now, your
chance of making any great
changes this year has gone.
Secondly, it is likely that,
in the near future, stringent
rules relating to the placing of
posters in U n i o n areas' w i l l
be introduced. These w i l l
be advertised beforehand, but
you have been warned! On a
similar note, w i l l any group
advertising in the hallowed
portals of I F please take the
posters down to their Union
office first. T h e point here
being that their administration
are not very keen on posters
being put up just inside the
front door, thus covering up
the fire exit poster.
Yours (lovingly a s ever)

this and with "Women and
S c i e n c e " c o l l e c t i v e that led
me to join the 'Women in
Science a n d Technology'
group. T h i s controversial
group has received more
abuse than a l l the other
s o c i e t i e s put together —
even ICWA has not received
that much abuse — and it i s
sad to note that most of It
unearned. A l l the women's
a c t i v i t i e s that are the wrong
side of Barbara Cartland are
put down to u s . T h e newly
elected Mr ICWA even accused
us of being responsible for
the Smoking Concert picket.
In addition, for reasons
known only to herself, s h e
found the Rape Debate
poster offensive.
It i s attitudes like these
which have caused many
people to ignore the a c t i v i t i e s
of our group or d i s m i s s them
as unimportant.This i s a great
pity because our group i s
very active, and h a s some
excellent meetings planned.
One of our main aims this
year is to meet s u c c e s s f u l
women s c i e n t i s t s a n d
engineers to d i s c u s s their
careers and the difficulties
they faced reaching the top
of their professions. T h e
most interesting of these
encounters should be the
one with E l e a n o r Macdonald
who runs the 'Women In
Management' group and i s a
very s u c c e s s f u l Industrialist
herself.
Our Wednesday meetings
continue in the ICWA lounge
as before, but on a slightly
more formal b a s i s . T h e
meetings usually deal with
aspects of a s c i e n c e and
w o m e n " .
It i s important to stress
that anyone i s welcome to
these meetings. Come along
any Wednesday and meet us —
we are not all raving feminists
and male haters — some
women survive three years
of this college without
emerging with a phobia
towards a l l things masculine.
