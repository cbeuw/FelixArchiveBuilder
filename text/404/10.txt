C I R C U M S T A N C E S b e y o n d
our control resulted . in a
much shorter than usual
game. F o r o n c e , fifteen
players turned up, more or
less on time; and there w a s
an unheard-of event: the coach
left on time. Normality then
reasserted itself. After a
few yards the coach stopped
in response to a lot of
noise from the first fifteen
who were a l s o aboard, but
as the reason for the noise
was not obvious to- anyone,
including the first fifteen
apparently, the coach preceded
only to stop again at the
Albert H a l l for ten minutes
before Steve Booth arrived
and embussed. T h e s i g n i f i c a n c e
of that event a l s o escaped
the A s . Then there w a s the
father-and-mother of a l l
traffic jams in Knightsbridge;
then a couple of stops to a s k
the w a y ; and then we had
arrived, miraculously on
time. That w a s fine for the
first fifteen but rough for the
A s .
" G e t changed and back on
your c o a c h , " shouted a
person who may have been
the Romford & G i d e a Park
captain or keeper. T h e A s
obeyed and after another
coach ride arrived at the
ground a n d , after indicating
seriousness of intent,'got the
game started.
End of excitement? A l a s ,
no. After only ten minutes
Nigel W i l l s h i r e threw himself
to the ground and refused to
rise. After consultation an
ambulance was summoned and
Willshire lay painfully on
the c o l d ground to await i t .
C o u l d we play around him?
That would have been a bit
much. (Someone may have
tripped over him and been
injured.) We waited, standing
around on the c o l d ground
and sympathising with h i m .
After half an hour the
ambulance arrived and much
to our surprise w a s not
being driven by a go-slow
junior doctor but just by a
go-slow ambulance driver.
The obstacle having been
removed, the game proceeded,
with one man m i s s i n g and
little daylight left.
Inspite of the weakend A ' s
team the Park team (which
included an IC turncoat)
never looked like scoring,
but then neither d i d the A ' s .
In the second half the A ' s
did a bit better, scoring
two tries to settle the match.
Rod Porter got the first,
following a Park mistake on
the line, and R i c h Jenner got
the s e c o n d . C h r i s Becque
got the ball from B o b L e e s o n ,
beat four players, and gave
R i c h a simple scoring p a s s .
A l l R i c h h a d to do w a s to run
it in ... from the half-way
line. John Fishburn managed
to convert i t . That try w a s
all the better for having
been carried out in pitch
darkness. T h e A ' s have
been instructed to eat nothing
but carrots in c a s e w e have
s i m i l a r problems next week.
The tri p back was uneventf u I
except for the half hour
spent at the local hospital
manoeuvring N i g e l (it-only-
hurts-when-l-laugh) W i l l s h i r e
out of a wheelchair and
into the c o a c h .

Royal Vets 3 Imperial College 4
by Paul Robins
IC T R A V E L L E D up to the
R o y a l V e t s ground in darkest
Hertfordshire knowing that
they had a tough match on
their hands against a strong
side. M i r a c u l o u s l y , the
coach w a s only 10 minutes
late, and s o w e arrived at
2pm, in good time for a 2.30
kick off. T h e mental attitude
of the team was good, and
they went onto the field
determined to w i n . F o r only
the third time t h i s season,
we w o n the toss, and elected
to play against the wind
and rain (it w a s a lovely
day for rugby). I C ' s forwards
started with a bang for a
change, and despite the
wind disadvantage, set up
some good positions for
their b a c k s . When Vets
kicked a long clearance,
IC counter attacked from
their own 2 5 . Some superb,
quick, clean handling by
the b a c k s , with the forwards
winning three good rucks, put*
A l a n Gregory over in the
corner for a fine try. IC
were rampant now, and should
have turned this to points
advantage. B u t several
players became a little over
eager, and from one such
bout of rashness in the
forwards, Vets reduced the
deficit to a single point
with a penalty goal just
before half time. T h i s w a s
s t i l l an excellent position
for IC, as they turned around
with the wind in their favour.
Unfortunately, the second
half, w a s a long story of
s u c c e s s i v e penalties against
us, surely not a l l justified,
and t h i s rattled our composure,
particularly in the forwards.
A l l we could do was s i t back
and defend, and this we d i d
magnificently, with barely a
tackle being m i s s e d . Due to
the narrowness of our
winning margin, we were
very pleased to hear the
final w h i s t l e , which took us
into the semi-finals, to be
played on February 11th, mark
it down in your d i a r i e s ,
as support would be much
appreciated. (See A Tel lam,

ON W E D N E S D A Y last week,
a party from IC braved the
wind and rain to take part in
a 'Score E v e n t ' on Hampstead
Heath. There were thirty
m a r k e r s laid out, and
competitors had to find as
many a s p o s s i b l e within
60 minutes. F o r every
minute overdue, one point
was deducted from the score.
Len Fawett managed to
find a remarkable number of
the points — 18, but bad
timekeeping meant he w a s
13 minutes late which
d r a s t i c a l l y reduced h i s
score. Pete Johnson w a s
easily the winner with 13
points, having arrived back
with 45 seconds to spare.
Martin K e s s l e r also d i d
well to find 12 markers but
he w a s also overdue, which
reduced h i s score to 9.
James S i n c l a i r , Michael
Paceyand Matthew Clements
were a l l orienteering for
the first time with the club,
with varying degrees of
s u c c e s s , although the last
mentioned managed to obtain
a large negative score by
forgetting to wind h i s watch
up before starting.

L A S T W E E K saw the start
of the inter-league knockout
cup. T h e F i r s t s had a difficult
away match against B S C who
pressing them for second
place in their d i v i s i o n .
With the game tied at 4—4
Kawei beat B S C ' S number
one player in a tense last
match to c l i n c h the match.
The second team, after
a b a d start to the season,
had won their last two
league games and were in
a confident mood against
C h u r c h i l l . They easily
scored their third s u c c e s s i v e
win, to move through to the
second round of the cup.
The F i r s t league tables
were c i r c u l a t e d ' last week
showing the F i r s t team as
joint leaders of their d i v i s i o n
with Harrow Road P o l i c e , but
unfortunately these are a
week out of date, and s i n c e
they were compiled a depleted
F i r s t team w a s soundly
beaten by the P o l i c e .
With three defeats in their
first three games followed by
two wins the second team was
in the middle of their d i v i s i o n .
If recent improved form
continues however, they w i l l
soon be pressing the leaders.
Imperial College II 6
Fulham V 3
W I L L I A M H O continued h i s
undefeated run of games for
the second team, a s they
beat Fulham by a much greater
margin than the score
suggests. T h i s now means
the second team have won
their last four games and
caused quite an upset in the
league.
L a s t week a l s o saw one
of the semi-finals of the
college knockout being
played. William Ho who had
narrowly edged out T i m
Ward in h i s quarter finals
match w a s playing against
Yee M i n Y i u who had a l s o
had a hard fight to beat
Mike P e r d i o s . H o looked
like continuing h i s winning
ways when he took the first
set after some aggressive
serves and r a l l y s , but the
experience of Y i u , who plays
for London University, showed
through and he fought back
well to w i n the game in
three sets.
The final w i l l be played
on Wednesday 10th December
in the T T room in the Union,
and let's hope it is just as
good as the semi-final w a s .
