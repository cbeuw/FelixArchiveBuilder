to put on their first full-length play - Sheridan's the Society took over the Concert Hall, on the second
" A School for Scandal" - two productions have been floor, where it has remained ever since, apart from an
given every year. In 1941 the Society was reformed as adventurous performance of T S Eliot's "Murder in
" T h e Imperial College Union Dramatic Society" and the Cathedral" the Great Hall.
Our two productions
take place in the penultimate
weeks of the Autumn and
Spring terms, and are generally
advertised widely, both in
the College and outside.
Auditions take place in the
first and last weeks of the
Autumn term. Parts are then
speedily learnt so that
rehearsals can begin in
earnest; these are held on
Sunday a f t e r n o o n s and
evenings and on two evenings
in the week (generally
Tuesday and Thursday).
Naturally not a l l the cast
are required at every rehearsal.
The S o c i e t y usually
selects a director who has a
play he wants to direct,
although this is not always
possible. A s p i r i n g directors
are rare and we are always
on the look-out for new
talent. On occasions the
director may choose to
organise a workshop s e s s i o n
for the actors — either in
movement or in improvisation —
one of their functions is
to help the actors get to
know one another.
In recent years our
productions have ranged
from the medieval (three
mystery plays) to the up-to-
date (Tom Stoppard's " T h e
Real Inspector H o u n d " ) ;
from the stark reality of
Arthur M i l l e r ' s " T h e C r u c i b l e "
to the absurdity of " T h e
Bald Prima D o n n a " by
Eugene lonesco.
The presentation of two
plays each year are but the
tip of the iceberg of Dramsoc's
manifold a c t i v i t i e s . Behind
the scenes "there are numerous
technical jobs to be done,
and services to be provided
for s o c i a l functions. Within
the Society there is a
continuous programme of-
overhaul • of the complex
sound and lighting equipment,

If anyone is interested
in helping to run the centre,
please come and see me
there. There is also a
vacancy for one ordinary
member of the Welfare
Committee — nominations
are required.

needs particular attention,
as does the out-dated system
of chokes used to control the
stage lighting. A s i d e from the
electrics there are, of course,
sets and properties to be
designed and constructed,
requiring a large number of
people to saw, hammer and
wield paint brushes. Outside
the Society our technical
expertise, lighting and sound
equipment is lent to a
variety of C a r n i v a l s , concerts,
dances and private parties,
culminating in the annual
R C S formal ball at Silwood
Park. We also provide
materials, tools and some of
the manpower for the Operatic
Society's February Show.
The Society would find
ot hard to exist without the
contributions made by girls
from I F . A s well a s providing
actresses they are able to
help in the active wardrobe
ana make-up departments.
They a l s o join u s in our
frequent v i s i t s to London
theatres — both professional
and amateur. T h i s year we
have already seen S i r John
Gielguld and Sir Ralph
Richardson in Harold P i n t e r ' s
" N o Man's L a n d " and
several performances by
students at the Central
School of Speech and Drama.
For the past three years
the Society h a s made an
annual foray Into the w i l d s of
Hampshire and Dorset in the
first fortnight of J u l y . A s
w e l l as providing a change
of scenery, the tour gives
the members a chance for a
little relaxation. We perform
in both schools and public
halls which we hire for
two or three nights. The
accommodation is in tents
and the c u i s i n e is first rate.
Needless to s a y , the technical
side comes out In force with
a van full of equipment which
has to be set up in each

Last Easter the S o c i e t y ' s

selected for the National
Student Drama F e s t i v a l
organised by the Sunday
Times. We gave two perform-
ances In the Collegiate
Theatre at University College.
The Sunday Times described
It as " a nimble p r o d u c t i o n " ,
whilst the festival newspaper
said " t h e y are to be commended
for their choice and their s k i l l
in presenting this p i e c e " .
T h i s session the festival
w i l l be in Edinburgh and it
is hoped that the Society w i l l
be sending some participants.
We have aspirations
towards an appearance on
IC Radio. Members of S T O I C
often come to our dress
rehearsals to give a little
publicity to our presentation,
the actors appreciate seeing
their performances when they
are played back on the
monitor.
Social events take place
occasionally in the form of
parties (generally held on the
last night of a production)
and v i s i t s to H a l l Dinners.
The Highlight of the year i s
the annual dinner which takes
place In February, amid a
welter of self-congratulation.
