Opsoc-not virtuosoes
O P S O C has a l l the facets
that go to make a successful
society. The members are
not only from IC, but students
from other colleges, people
who could not bear to leave
when they finished College,
and various others who do
not fit into any particular
category. Although there is
a c l o s e liaison with the
Royal C o l l e g e of Music
(a great help to any musical
society), " v i r t u o s o " qualities
are not necessarily required,
just an enjoyment of singing
and a desire to achieve a
final polished performance.
The s o c i e t y ' s main aim is
the production of two light
operas (usually Gilbert and
Sullivan) every year. One
of these takes place in
College in February, and
preparations for next term's
" U t o p i a L i m i t e d " are well
underway. The second is
the summer vacation, when
singers, orchestra and stage -
grew set-off to put on a show
in some remote corner of
England. A few years ago,
this 'tour' went to Budleigh
Salterton in Devon, and was
so w e l l received that this
town has been the venue
for the summer performance
ever s i n c e . There are a l s o
concerts at appropriate times
such as Easter and Christmas,
and carol singing around
local h o s p i t a l s . A new
venture being attempted at
the end of this term Is a
sponsored marathon sing,
where the society w i l l be
singing straight through a l l
13 Gilbert " and Sullivan
operas consecutively (which
it is reckoned, will take
about thirty hours to complete).
Apart from its musical
a c t i v i t i e s , Opsoc's social
side Is very important to all
Its members. The calender
abounds with parties both in
College and in people's
houses. Every rehearsal
ends up retiring to Southside
bar and so tends not to finish
until .11.30! Hence by the
time it is getting c l o s e to
performance and rehearsals
occur twice a week, people
tend to find that their free
time is very occupied. T h i s
may sound like hard work,
and occasionally it dnes
seem so, but generally it
is thoroughly enjoyed by a l l
involved.
The greatest s o c i a l event
of the year is, however, the
summer tour. T h i s is more
of a holiday than two weeks
of rehearsals and performances
(of which there are nine In
in all). At least it is this
for singers and orchestra;
it is considerably harder for
those engaged in building a
set from materials brought
all the way from London.
Insplte of the fact we
have a number of members
who have been with the society
for well over five years, an
indication of the enjoyment
to be found with us, anyone
with an interest in operetta
or other forms of music, a
desire to help on the technical
side (set building, lighting,
costumes etc.) or just the
wish to join a s o c i a l musical
society is welcome to any of
our rehearsals In 53, P r i n c e ' s
Gate at 7.30 pm on Tuesday
evenings.
Jazz Club-
all that free
music?!
O N E T H I N G H A S struck me
above a l l else since joining
the J a z z C l u b Committee;
that is the difficulty of
giving away music free!
One would think that there
would be plenty of people
withing nothing better to do
than sit in the comfort of
the Union Lower Lounge on
Sunday evening listening to
live bands whose music
ranges from rock (remember
Burlesque!!) to traditional
jazz, but apparently this
is not the c a s e .
If we have not been very
successful at attracting
audiences, then at least
we have been extremely
successful in obtaining
bands of a very high standard
from a l l over London and
encouraging college bands
by providing a venue for
gigs.
T h i s brings me on to the
playing aspects of our
a c t i v i t i e s . The J a z z C l u b
owns a rather sordid room
located midway between
the Union office and Dramsoc
in the Union B u i l d i n g . T h i s
is . a v a i l a b l e for use by
members at anytime. We also
own an amplifier, four
columns, two microphones,
a drum kit, two pianoes and
a double bass which are for
use by members.
Unfortunately, the more
'removable' items have to be
kept under lock and key.

T H E M U S I C A L S O C I E T Y
c o n s i s t s of two organisations
which function independently
of each other in their activities
but work together irv their
aim to provide an outlet for
tha a b i l i t i e s of students
in the music field. The two
bodies are Imperial College
Symphony Orchestra and
Imperial College Choir.
The Orchestra at present
has about forty regular
players of whom the majority
are IC students. It has been
conducted for the past
couple of years by Dr Gavin
Park. The Orchestra practices
every Wednesday in the
Great H a l l .
The Orchestra gives
three concerts a year, one
in each term, and attempts
to cover some major works.
Besfdes this, the Orchestra
runs smaller instrumental
groups such a s the 'Wind
Band' and the 'String Group'.
These offer the opportunity
for the players of various
instruments which may not
be required in the full
orchestra, to practice.
These f a c i l i t i e s are regularly
used by fiye or six bands of
various species and by many
individuals who just wish to
practice their instruments.
That b a s i c a l l y is the
range of our a c t i v i t i e s
at present, but we are open
to suggestions, particularly
from people who are prepared
to do a bit of work and help
in the organisation (we are
desperately short of committee
members). Anyone interested
should contact either myself
or our President, Mike
Woodward, Mech Eng 2.
N i g e l H a r r i s o n ,
These groups can also give
their own public performances.
The Orchestra is a l s o a
social group. Music Camp
weekends, dinners and
parties are arranged to
enable members to get to
know each other.
The other section of the
Musical Society is the
Choir. T h i s has a membership
of approximately 160 and
is conducted by Professor
E r i c Brown. P r a c t i c e s are
held every Thursday evening
in Lecture Theatre 342,
Mech. E n g . The Choir is
mixed voice by virtue of its
female singers recruited
from surrounding colleges
as well as IC.
A s with the Orchestra,
the Choir g ves a concert in
each term and the next
concert is on F r i d a y 5th
Dec (today) in the Great
Hall - all are welcome.
Besides the concerts,
the Choir arranges a c t i v i t i e s
for the members, aimed at
producing a good s o c i a l
spirit. T h i s term, the Choir
has been on a week-end
Music Camp and before the
end of term there w i l l be a
Christmas Dinner. The Choir
w i l l sing at Christmas H a l l
Dinner, and there will be
Carol Singing around the
Mews. Further activities
are being arranged for next
term.
A subsiderary group of the
Choir is the Madrigal Singers
who meet after rehearsals.
If you sing or play an
instrument, the M u s i c a l
Society hopes to provide some
part for you tp play. If you
enjoy listening to choral
or orchestral music it is
hoped that our efforts at
concerts give you pleasure.
F o l k C l u b -
no m o r e 'till
next week!
A S H A D O W Y figure stumbles
in the dark, as he reaches for
the light switches, curses
under his breath as he catches
the lingering odour of cold
Heinz Spaghetti, and burned
sausages, and takes another
sip from a half-hour old pint
of IPA. It's the same old
routine again; open the
windows to freshen the a i r
push the tables aside to
make more room, and sit and
wait for the people to arrive.
And then, for a few short
hours, the Union lower
Refectory becomes one of
London's leading folk venues.
The guest singer arrives:
maybe a traditional singer
from the Midlands, a comedian
from up north, or a singer-
songwriter from NW3. The
audience drift in; some to
listen (and some to heckle);
some to stand up and sing,
(and some to sit in the
corner and get pissed.)
There are many widely
different kinds of music that
may be c a l l e d " f o l k " , and
many different ways in which
" f o l k " may be presented.
Ask anIC F o l k C l u b regular
what Bob Pegg and " M a g i c
L a n t e r n " have in common.
Certainly the same musical
tastes, and a great mutual
respect, but the presentation
of their music could hardly
be more different! or compare
C h r i s Rohmann and N i c
Jones', they both stand up in
front of F o l k Club audiences
with a guitar, a glass of beer,
and wealth of talent, but their
musical styles have little
in common!
The essential 'ingredient
of those and a l l the other
acts on the " F o l k C l u b
C i r c u i t " must come down to
the old, indefinable " F o l k
Club A t m o s p h e r e " . The top
artists are those who can
bring out the kind of atmosphere
that keeps the crowds coming
back for more. At the end of
the evening there's nothing
more gratifying than an
audience making it obvious
that they don't wont to go
home until they're sure there's
no more ' t i l l next week!
If you haven't been to a
F o l k Club before, why not
give it a try one Wednesday
night? Even if you don't like
Steeleye' or Dylan, and you
feel i l l every time the spinners
appear on the box, you
might enjoy IC F o l k C l u b !
....And so the lights go out,
and a shadowy figure makes
his way out into the night
to catch the last 49. It's
been yet another good evening,
judging by the cries for a
third encore, and the guest
has been hinting that he'd
like to play again next year.
But it's time to get back to
reality, and think about
Lab reports, and tomorrows
dinner, and things. Back to
reality until next Wednesday
night, anyway ...
