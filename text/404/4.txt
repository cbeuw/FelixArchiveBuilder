External Eclairs
WHY C A L L THIS column " E x t e r n a l E c l a i r s " you may well ask?
My answer i s that Its appearance (for the very first time) should
bring great pleasure and its departure leave one hankering for
more — and it has a certain eclat, don't you think? Anyway, as
'cross country report", it does not
long as it i s not entitled
really matter.
What is it all about?
People often a s k me what
an External Affairs Officer
does;this is difficult to answer.
E s s e n t i a l l y , I suppose, the
job involves the dissemination
of information about, and the
stimulation of student involv-
ment i n , " a l l matters external
to I C " , that i s , s p e c i f i c a l l y
concerning s o c i a l and political
i s s u e s . I am required to
liaise with the N U S , and a l l
its appendages such a s
E n d s l e i g h Insurance, N U S
T r a v e l , NUS Marketing, L S O
etc, and with other colleges,
Hence I spend a great deal of
time going to meetings and
conferences around the country
and d i s c u s s i n g various matters
with student union people in
other colleges. T o a s s i s t in
the pursuit of this brief, there
is an External Affairs
Committee, (which can
accommodate anyone interested
in such matters).
LSO etc
There are two bodies on
which I represent the members
of IC Union; one is the
Student Representative
C o u n c i l of the University of
London Union, U L U S R C , and
the other is the West London
Committee of the L S O . The
latter i s the local Area
organisation of the N U S .
Since L S O i s extremely
large, it is split into a number
of sub-areas. We belong to
the West London sub-area,
which e s s e n t i a l l y contains
all the colleges of U S K and
of the Brunei-centred equivalent,
C A T B U M S . W e l l , if you followed
a l l those initials, c o n -
gratulations.
So what are these organ-
isations going to do for you?
T o some extent that is up to
you, because I c a n only act
on the instructions of Council
and Union General Meetings
— and I suggest that you a l l
attend U G M ' s and make your,
opinions heard. A t present,
L S O (West London) are
thinking about organising
inter collegiate sports
competitions within the area,
and about producing 'ents
sheets' as U S K and C A T B U M S
d i d . A t the moment, there is
a great debate going on
regarding the structure of
LSO, mostly about finance,
and a l s o regarding the
usefulness of the organisation.
At present, the L S O has
o c c a s s i o n a l conferences to
d i s c u s s political and s o c i a l
questions and to organise
campaigns, which are initiated
by the N U S executive under
instructions from National
Conferences.
DES Picket
While on the subject of
campaigns, I would like to
thank the handful of people
who turned out at midnight
last Thursday to take the
first four-hour shift of the
24-hour picket of the D E S .
We actually turned out 6
people, not including Trev
P h i l l i p s , which outnumbered
the combined delegations of
several other ex-USK colleges
who shall remain nameless. In
the absence o f our banner (could
we have it back please?) we
stood in the A r c t i c cold and
gale force winds holding an
NUS banner, which I thought
was rather incongruous since,
as I said to Steve ("Where's
the bloody soup then?")
Brightman, IC has probably
been disaffiliated from N U S
for more years than most
other colleges present had
been affiliated!
So we sat/stood there and
watched the secuirty guards
andthey watched u s . Proceedings
were en livened by the a c t i v i t i e s
of a local down-and-out. who
fell around drinking anything
offered (or not) until the
friendly local constabulary
offered him accommodation
for the night. (I bet he got
some soup,) Whether or not we
impressed upon the D E S
that sutdents are opposed to
the Drastic cuts in teacher
training proposed by them,
we certainly discouraged
anyone from entering the
building between midnight
and four o'clock.
At four, we went off with
various people from Shoreditch,
Liverpool (I'm sure they're
not in West London?!), Royal
Holloway and E a l i n g for our
meal break. Well, South Bank
Poly had shut down their
soup s u p p l i e s , s o we tried
the salubrious M i c k ' s Cafe in
Fleet Street, which w a s
a l s o c l o s e d , and then a place
in V i c t o r i a and that too was
c l o s e d . I vaguely remember
being driven into the new
Covent Garden market, where
Pete told the chap on the
gate (as he put his foot down
on the accelerator) that w e ' d
come to collect a box of
apples. We returned to the
picket at about 05.15am and
decided we had shown sufficient
solidarity for one night, so we
gracefully retired to Charing
Cross to await the first tube.
I hope that this tale encourages
you to come along and freeze
next time — I suppose y o u ' l l
find me there.

The latest idea to come
out of N U S , and a good deal
Stay solvent this X m a s !
AS T H E C H R I S T M A S vacation approaches, bank balances are
dwindling. However, do not despair. A s a student you are entitled
to c l a i m supplementary benefit throughout the vacation. T h i s
can be obtained from your local s o c i a l security office. The only
condition i s that you must be available for work. Y o u w i l l be
allowed a preference for type of work, but may be offered anything
for which the employment officer thinks you are suitable. A n
offer c a n be refused only for a genuine reason, for example,
physical d i s a b i l i t y (for manual work) or because the job i s not
within reasonable travelling distance,
work i s available,
If no
then you w i l l " s i g n o n " .
If you are living at home
during the vacation, you must
take proof of your address,
your last bank statement, any
savings details and proof
of the amount of your grant
when you go to sign o n .
Payment w i l l be by post in
the form of a Giro cheque and
w i l l c o n s i s t of a personal
allowance of £7.65 per week
plus 95p towards your parents
rent etc, less a deduction
of approximately £3.00. T h i s
last i s the sum allowed in
L E A grants per week of
vacation.
If you are staying in h a l l ,
flat or lodgings, you must
take along a l l the information
mentioned above and your
lease agreement or rent book.
The benefit w i l l be £9.60
per week only over rent less
about £3.00. Should your
rent include food or heating
c o s t s , a further deduction
w i l l be made.
In the case of those whose
parents have not paid their
contribution to their grant,
an appeal can be lodged.
T h i s must be done within 21
days of receiving a final
assessment, in writing.
While receiving benefit
you have to ' s i g n o n ' once
a week. If you w i s h to go
home during the Christmas
week, y o u c a n fill in a
holiday form and benefit
w i l l be held over until your
return. T h e return date
must however, be specified.
Benefit i s also payable
to people staying with friends
but not paying rent and
o c c a s s i o n a l ly to overseas
students if their financial
situation has deteriorated
since their arrival in the U K ,

L E A ' s do have the power
to award "discretionary
vacational h a r d s h i p " grants
but these are very rare. If you
are continuing supervised
study during the vacation, you
are e l i g i b l e for a vacation
grant. This is arranged
through the College, so
check with your tutor.
Any further information
required can be obtained from
the Student Welfare Centre
at lunchtimes.
The Student Welfare Centre
What it is
The centre is a place
that i s open every weekday
lunchtime (12.30pm - 1.30pm)
w h e n y o u c a n go f o r
information on topics ranging
from contraception to legal
aid, from vacation grants to
accommodation. Drop in and
see us about anything that
is troubling y o u — coffee
is provided. Myself and others
are there on Mondays,
Wednesdays and F r i d a y s .
On Tuesdays and Thursdays,
you c a n see Don Adlington,
the Student Counsellor
without prior appointment.
Where it is
The centre is at the top
of the Union Building so
you are advised to use the
continued on page 7
more sensible than many, is
the new Marketing scheme. If
you drop into the Union
Office you can collect leaflets
about the small pilot scheme,
which is already taking
£20,000 per week. N U S , by
bulk-buying have been able to
get hugh discounts on such
items as sports goods,
sleeping bags, saucepans
(over 50% discount!) and a
large selection of calculators.
T h i s i s , I must stress, only
a pi lot scheme, and negotiations
are continuing to extend the
range of goods, for example,
H P 2 5 ' s may soon be
available and Marketing are
also negotiating for wines e t c .
Well, I think that's
enough for this week, s o I'll
get back to plotting what
we are going to do to the
N U S Executive at Scarborough
this weekend (the delegates
w i s h to deny a l l rumours
that the Dalek i s programmed
to zap Charles Clarke. We're
just taking it along for the
bracing s e a a i r which should
recharge its batteries, along
with the case of hand grenades
and a tactical nuclear weapon
— oops, what a giveaway.)
A last though — in the
words of Ian Minnis, President
of Aston University Students'
Union, " Y o u don't need to
wear w e l l i e s to shag sheep,
but it h e l p s " .
