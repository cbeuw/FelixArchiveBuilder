SCAB : Who they are, what they do.
Introduction
E N T E R T A I N M E N T IS N O T the sole aim of those
clubs/societies that constitute the " S o c i a l , Cultural
and Amusements B o a r d " (SCAB). It is true that this
is a common factor, that one way or another, at some
time or another, S C A B clubs do provide entertainment,
that this is what distinguishes S C A B from R C C and
S C C because many of the S C A B c l u b s do have
recreational and social activities; it was only this
term that the Musical Society transferred to S C A B
from R C C . Dramsoc are very socially orientated;
going to the theatre or attending H a l l Dinner is not
unusual for them. Even IC Ents, the largest entertain-
ment providers at College with three regular events a
week (that's bordering on the industrial) cannot in
fairness be accused of existing solely for these
purposes.
It was for this reason that when S C A B was formed
just over two years ago, it was not called the " E n t e r -
taining Clubs Comittee" ( E C C ) to be in line with the
other Union Major Sub-Committees, A C C , R C C , S C C .
it became — although an unfortunate abbreviation in
itself — it was felt that this title best embodied the
activities of those within it.
However, having denied that S C A B clubs are solely
entertainments based, I have not f o r g o t t e n that
entertainment i s a common activity, nor will I claim
that S C A B has the monopoly in this field. T h e three
C C U ' s , A C C , R C C , S C C , H a l l s and Houses all provide
their own entertainments. But entertainment i s a
luxury — an inexpensive luxury at IC — so go and
support it, join a club, buy a ticket. Who knows you
may enjoy yourself.

Ents-a band of
dedicated decadents
T H E E N T ( E R T A I N M E N T ) S
Committee is a body of
dedicated decadents whose
sole purpose i s to make
your life more enjoyable.
We put on the Thursday
films, Friday d i s c o s and
Saturday concerts. The
d i s c o now belongs to Ents
and is hired out for parties
within C o l l e g e .
Membership of the committee
is free, and E n t s people get
into the events we put on
free. The c a t c h , of course,
is that members are expected
to devote themselves body
and soul to the organisation
and running of entertainment
within the C o l l e g e . F o r
instance, a typical concert
involves a large number of
simple but time consuming
tasks such as s t i c k i n g up
posters, handbill ing concerts
at inferior venues,„ s e l l i n g
tickets (thanks to B i l l and
John), humping equipment,
keeping out gatecrashers,
clearing up afterwards and
occasionally watching the
band. However, as this
work is spread over the
thirty-odd members of the
committee the amount each
individual does i s not
e x c e s s i v e , and would be
even less if more people
joined. We hold meetings
every Monday at 12.45pm
in the Room at the T o p , IC
Union, if y o u are-interested.
Joining the committee
is the best way of influencing
the type of entertainment
we provide; another way i s
to fill in the questional re
in this supplement a s fully
and a s intelligently as you
can. When doing this, please
bear in mind what could be
c a l l e d the Jethro Z e p p e l i n
syndrome: when we a s k
what groups people would
like to s e e appearing at
the college they invariably
ask for t h e -
R o l l i n g F l o y d or
similar. Unfortunately the
s i z e of our h a l l , and the
c l o s e proximity of larger
venues, make bands costing
more than about £1250 u n -
w i l l i n g to play here, and
anyway we would have to
charge r i d i c u l o u s l y high
admission prices. I'd be
e s p e c i a l l y interested to
hear suggestions for alternative
types of entertainment; for
example, we used to run
Friday night hops, with a
small band and d i s c o in the
Union Concert H a l l ; and
C i t y University are experiment-
ing with club/cabaret s t y l e
evenings. I think that E n t s
serves a rather limited
range of interests at the
moment, and we really need
your ideas to widen the
spectrum.

F I L M S O C I E T Y as might
be guessed, screens films.
The films included i n our
programme, are of a type
that would not ngrmally find
an outlet due to the fact
that they are either foreign,
or contemporary, or are
not deemed commercially
viable, but despite a l l this
are worth screening. In an
attempt to achieve a balanced
programme, some of the more
worthy E n g l i s h dialogue films
also find inclusion in this
season's s e l e c t i o n .
The Society is a member
of the B r i t i s h Federation of
F i l m Societies together with
being a corporate member of
The National F i l m Theatre,
the latter entitling any member
of F i l m Society to use our
National F i l m Theatre
Corporate Membership T i c k e t .
We are a l s o fortunate in
being o c c a s i o n a l l y invited
to the Gate Cinema at Notting
H i l l for press screenings of
their latest programme.
L i a i s o n i s a l s o beginning to
take place between our
society and another in t h i s
area, which we hope w i l l
continue to develop, to
enable greater flexibility
of resources and c h o i c e of
films.
Apart from screening the
regular F i l m Society programme
we offer the facility of
screening films for other
clubs and s o c i e t i e s , the
change being 75p per hour
for the projector and 75p per
hour for the projectionist.
A s we have a cinemascope
screen in our possession,
this f a c i l i t y a l s o extends to
cinemascope films.
We are always w i l l i n g to
train anyone who w i s h e s to
learn how to project films,
indeed anyone who can
project, and would like to
help in the screening of o u r
films i s more than welcome
to do s o .
Our films are shown at
7.15pm most Friday evenings
in Mechanical Engineering
220 or in the Great H a l l ,
Sherfield B u i l d i n g . Membership
at £1.50 per season, permits
free entry to a l l the films
of the season; full guests in
each season being allowed
free entrance for each member.
If y o u w i s h to know any
further details regarding, the
N F T card, Gate viewing
s e s s i o n s , projector hire or
just w i s h to become involved
in the Society please do not
hesitate to approach any
member of our committee.
