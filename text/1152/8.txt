In our continuing trip around IC's four faculty unions it's the turn of the Royal College of Science
Union, led by their President, Will Bentley, to explain just who they are and what they do.
T
he Royal C o l l e g e of S c i e n c e is
o n e o f t h e f o u r constituent
c o l l e g e s that m a k e u p Imper-
ial. Its U n i o n satisfies t h e n e e d s ,
surprisingly e n o u g h , o f scientists in
Imperial C o l l e g e - that is B i o l o -
gists, Biochemists, Physicists a n d ,
of c o u r s e , M a t h e m a t i c i a n s (includ-
ing Joint M a t h s a n d C o m p u t i n g ) .
As this is b e i n g written, w e find
ourselves in t h e m i d d l e of a very
busy week! M o n t h s o f p l a n n i n g are
starting t o p a y off with a very s u c -
cessful a n d e n j o y a b l e start t o
Freshers week, both f o r the Fresh-
ers a n d the rest of us. It started o n
M o n d a y with a " q u i e t " get together
of all the n e w entrants for the first,
a n d (judging b y its success) d e f i -
nitely not the last, Freshers B a r b e -
cue - free f o o d a n d a c h a n c e to
chat informally to their n e w offi-

were discussing t h e R C S U ' s role,

O f c o u r s e w e realise that
after Freshers week things c a n
g o a bit flat, a n d so events have

this term. Future high

O n g o i n g t h r o u g h o u t this term,
the Freshers D e p a r t m e n t a l Dinners

way, but with t h e a d d e d rivalries

ple w a n t to inflict revenge o n m a t h -

has c a u s e d t h e m . It s h o u l d b e
noted that a l t h o u g h these a r e c l a s -

f r o m other years a r e warmly wcl-

prices are surprisingly low.
T h e R C S has its o w n clubs a s
well, most f a m o u s l y the R C S M o t o r
C l u b which looks after J e z e b e l , the
official transport of t h e president
a n d o n e of o u r mascots. Jezebel is
an inviolate m a s c o t a n d therefore
is not a l l o w e d to be " b o r r o w e d " by
other unions. W e d o h o w e v e r have

O n a m o r e serious note, w e

W e a r e a l s o always o p e n t o sug-

service to the scientists at Imperial.
All that remains t o say is that I
