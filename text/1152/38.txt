some have a particular engineering focus and others
are much more general business topics. As an engineer
Unilever ensures that your training encompasses all
the necessary areas to become chartered.
What won me over to working for Unilever is the
number of different areas of the business I would have
an opportunity of working in. After this experience I
will be in a much better position to know what part of
the business suits me best. The best advice I can give
for those unsure of which company to join, is to meet as
many people from a company as possible and ask
yourself; would I want to work with them?
/ graduated from IC in 1998 when a rumble of construction
accompanied my Biology with Management finals as the
Medical School was finally completed. My Unilever journey
began with a 3-month summer placement working as an
Information Management trainee at Lever Brothers in Liverpool.
It was the experience of meeting such an extraordinary calibre of
people that led me to apply for the Unilever Company
Management Development Scheme (UCMDS) in my
penultimate year at IC.
Several rounds of gruelling interviews and a fantastic summer
holiday later I arrived at Van den Bergh Foods ready to face the
surreal world of Flora Marathons, Mr Pepperami and PG Chimps.
From day one I was given instant responsibility, projects which
were clearly valued by the business. Like any challenging job the
learning curve is steep, but you're given every aspect of the
training that you reguire, from project management, through to
negotiation, mediation and even creativity training!
What really attracted me to the Unilever graduate scheme was
the philosophy, that to be a successful senior manager you are
reguired to have a comprehensive cross-functional business
understanding. So, the training scheme reflects this, in the form
of secondments providing variety coupled with cutting edge
business strategy - which is why the scheme is undisputedly one
of the best global graduate training opportunities.
My first project at Van den Bergh Foods was as leader of a
European Extended Supply Chain Harmonisation Initiative or
EESCHI for short! 11 can still remember arriving on my first day to
be presented with return tickets to Amsterdam. One year on and
I've just finished a six-month placement working in Marketing,
as Assistant Brand Manager on my much loved 7-day a week
Pasta accompaniment as a student -RAGU. It's great, 6 months
in and I was deciding how to spend the brands' million pound
promotional budget - it's surprisingly easy once you know how!
My current position is as Project leader for an interactive media
initiative, which will have implications for Unilever globally.
For me what sets Unilever apart from its rivals is that it's a real
people Multinational, with high profile global opportunities.
I joined Unilever in 1986 as a sponsored student with Lever
Brothers, after going t h r o u g h a o n e day Selection Board similar
to that used to recruit graduates. In the year preceding
university and during the s u m m e r holidays, I w o r k e d o n a
n u m b e r of different, very interesting projects both in the UK and
in Germany. A l t h o u g h most of my time was spent o n
manufacturing and engineering projects, I also spent time in the
Personnel and Marketing functions. O n e of the aspects of the
Unilever m a n a g e m e n t training that I appreciated was the
opportunity to learn about the business as a whole, t h r o u g h
practical experience in a n u m b e r of functions.
W h e n I graduated f r o m Imperial College with an M E n g in
Mechanical Engineering in 1 9 9 1 , I transferred to the Foods
Division as a hybrid technical / commercial trainee. During that
time I had a n u m b e r of roles: Cost A c c o u n t a n t for our meat pie
factory, Project M a n a g e r for the relocation of s o m e process
e q u i p m e n t d u e to site closure, Materials Planner for Batchelors,
Shift Controller for our Tea Factory to n a m e but a few. After
eighteen m o n t h s I was given my first m a n a g e m e n t position as a
Production Planner. After a further eighteen m o n t h s , I was
a p p o i n t e d as the Project M a n a g e r i m p l e m e n t i n g new supply
chain processes and systems. I then left to have my first child
after which I returned to w o r k full time as the Supply Chain
M a n a g e r for the Batchelors Business G r o u p . After having my
second child I returned to work four days a week in my current
capacity as a Supply Chain Project Manager. This involves
designing and implementing a n e w organisation that is m o r e
focused o n delivering supply chain excellence for our UK and
European customers.
I have never regretted my decision to join Unilever. O n several
occasions I have considered moving on to broaden my
experience but despite other job offers, I have always chosen to
stay. T h e package they offer is very competitive, especially the
extras such as maternity benefit, pension, sharesave and health
care. The Unilever culture suits m e and I like the people that I
work with. I have always had very stretching a n d varied roles
with Unilever. They have also been very g o o d at
a c c o m m o d a t i n g my personal wishes.
I believe that Unilever will continue to offer challenging,
rewarding careers in an ever-changing organisation.
G o o d luck with your degrees a n d with the decisions you make
regarding your careers.
Be part of it.
