BALLS: T H E T R U T H
G r e a t first issue!
I just thought we should sort out
s o m e facts about the losses m a d e
this S u m m e r and deal f o r next year.
O k , the final loss o n the IC Boll
was £16,700. Tickets sales were b a d
e n o u g h that i C U s a w them c o m i n g
a n d a cunning plan to ask C o l l e g e
for the difference w a s hatched. M r .
David H e l l a r d , the then. President,
did a lot of g r o u n d work a n d b e g -
ging a n d C o l l e g e smiled o n h i m .
There were always g o i n g to be c o n -
ditions for the payment, they arrived
after I took office. T h e deal w a s
thus....
- T h e Ball should be held in o r close
to South Ken, if at al! possible.
- The M e d i c Ball a n d (for want of a
better word) ' n o n - m e d i c ' Balls
should be separated by date, rather
than 2 4 hours.
A n y o n e w h o wants to see the full
text is w e l c o m e to see it, it's even less
interesting than this letter though!
So to s u m m a r i z e ; N o money will
be taken f r o m the strategic reserves,
the Beit Project is safe from this point
of view. I w o s never faced with the
option of having to b a n the medics
f r o m a 2 0 0 0 S u m m e r Ball, o n e d a y
o n e President will b e , but by then the
idea is the medics will be fully inte-
grated. I C U still wholly believes in
student input a n d there will be d
S u m m e r Ball committee for both
Balls (if either group c a n elect a
chair), the Ents a n d Marketing m a n -
ager will have more input, as will
other permanent staff, in the hope w e
don't lose as m u c h cash. C o n t i n u e d
losses of this kind c o u l d finish the
S u m m e r Ball for g o o d . I C U has been
looking into options f o r complying
with C o l l e g e ' s request to have the
Ball closer t o h o m e (we w o u l d not
have said yes if it hadn't been possi-
ble). It will be up to the committee to
decide h o w this g o e s forward.
So, hope this cleared u p a few
things. Sorry none of you c a m e over
to talk about this before it went to
press.
See you s o o n ,
Tashd

T H E W E E K L Y R A N T
D e a r Sir,
Imperial C o l l e g e is not k n o w n f o r
s u p p o r t i n g , o r even a c k n o w l e d g -
ing the existence of, its u n d e r g r a d -
uate students. H o w e v e r , the c o l -
lege sport & leisure division h a s
spent c o p i o u s a m o u n t s o f money,
t i m e , a n d r e s o u r c e s trying t o
i m p r o v e the quality o f sporting
provision for the students of Imper-
ial.
I a m therefore greatly d i s a p -
p o i n t e d t o discover that the Imper-
ial C o l l e g e U n i o n president is not
fully b a c k i n g t h e current sports
centre p r o p o s a l . This facility is des-
perately n e e d e d b y m a n y students,
especially t h o s e involved in i n d o o r
sports such a s b a s k e t b a l l a n d v o l -
leyball. Every year, t h e volleyball
t e a m have t o turn a w a y beginners
a n d c o m p e t i t i v e players alike d u e
to the lack o f i n d o o r s p a c e in
w h i c h t o p r a c t i c e . I a m c o n f u s e d a s
to w h y students w o u l d elect such a
p e r s o n w h o o b v i o u s l y d o e s not put
their needs first, a n d instead h a s
e m b a r k e d o n s o m e k i n d o f dillu-
s i o n e d p o w e r trip in a n attempt t o
a n n o y a n d d o m i n a t e those a r o u n d
her.
A n d a n o t h e r thing: Perhaps t h e
mdjority o f m e d i c a l students a r e
against the sports centre p r o p o s a l
as it h a s b e e n hinted T e d d i n g t o n
sp or t s g r o u n d will b e s o l d to
f i n a n c e t h e d e v e l o p m e n t . But p e o -
ple a r e forgetting that there a r e
m e d i c a l students o n t h e S o u t h
K e n s i n g t o n c a m p u s , a n d the grnd-
udl, but i m p o r t a n t , integration o f
m e d i c a l students into t h e clubs &
societies o f I C U , m e a n s that this
d e v e l o p m e n t will eventually benefit
all the students o f Imperial C o l -
lege.
S o m e t i m e s p e o p l e in s u c h
positions o f p o w e r forget that they
are not at t h e t o p of the u n i o n
structure. It is the students w h o
c o m e first. T h o s e e l e c t e d have
f o u n d themselves w h e r e they a r e
b e c a u s e w e t h o u g h t they w o u l d d o
a g o o d j o b a n d u p h o l d o u r views.
Perhaps w e were all mistaken a n d
easily d e c i e v e d .
A N D FINALLY...
D e a r Felix,
C o n g r a t s o n a fine l o o k i n g first
issue but I must ask, w h e r e has the
cat g o n e ? Felix just doesn't l o o k
right without a c a t a d o r n i n g it's
front p a g e . . Please c a n y o u d o
s o m e t h i n g t o resolve this issue a s
s o o n a s p o s s i b l e .
Yours,
S i m o n
