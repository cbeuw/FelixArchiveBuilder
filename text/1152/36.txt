We have designed two courses to give
you a brief but realistic view of the
functions of management. Using a
series of case studies and business
simulations, we hope to give you an
insight into what it feels like to work
as a manger within Unilever.
We recognise that choosing a career,
let alone a company, can be difficult.
We hope that by attending one of our
management courses in your final
year, this decision will be made a little
easier for you.
