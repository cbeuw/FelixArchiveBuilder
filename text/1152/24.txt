American Pie
S o m e w h e r e d e e p b e n e a t h the level of There's S o m e t h i n g A b o u t M a r y
a n d D u m b a n d D u m b e r , beneath Porky's, lower even than a n aver-
a g e h e a d l i n e in the N e w s o f the W o r l d o r the S u n d a y Sport, you'll
find a w h o l e n e w definition of "lowest c o m m o n d e n o m i n a t o r " . The
kind o f level where any joke that doesn't involve c o n d o m s , breasts,
erections o r s p e r m simply isn't funny. The kind o f level where you'll
feel e m b a r r a s s e d simply to b e w a t c h i n g the g a g s b e i n g u n l e a s h e d -
a n d s c a r e d by the fact that you're l a u g h i n g at t h e m . The kind of level
best typified by g r o u p s of spotty fifteen year-olds sitting a r o u n d a n d
s n i g g e r i n g - a n d it's this level that A m e r i c a n Pie taps into. In terms o f
crudity, A m e r i c a n Pie simply is o n a w h o l e new level.
S o it's rubbish then? W e l l , actually, no. This certainly isn't the kind of
m o v i e you'd take your mother to (or your girlfriend for that matter),
but nonetheless it has m o m e n t s o f g e n u i n e c o m i c brilliance a m o n g s t
the rapid-fire g a g s . The premise is simple - a g r o u p of four teenagers
in their final year of H i g h S c h o o l m a k e a pact to all loose their vir-
ginity before they g r a d u a t e , a n d promptly set a b o u t a variety of mis-
adventures in a series o f m i s g u i d e d attempts t o get their e n d away.
A n a v e r a g e night in the U n i o n you might think, but these guys a r e
sadder, m o r e desperate a n d m o r e full o f l a m e chat-up lines than
a n y o n e y o u might have met at IC - they will, quite literally, d o any-
thing. I won't give a w a y too m a n y of the jokes, for fear of ruining
s o m e o f the most inspired (or sick, d e p e n d i n g o n your point of view)
m o m e n t s , but suffice to say you can't understand the m e a n i n g of the
w o r d " d e p r a v e d " until you've seen a t e e n a g e r attempt to s h a g a n
a p p l e p i e . . .
The p r o b l e m , however, is that o n c e you've identified the level that the
movie's o p e r a t i n g o n the jokes b e c o m e p h e n o m e n a l l y o b v i o u s - a n d
frequently you'll find the entire c i n e m a l a u g h i n g hysterically five m i n -
utes b e f o r e the p u n c h l i n e arrives. Admittedly the quality of the stars
doesn't h e l p matters m u c h (the cast list peaks out with o n e o f the bit-
part girls f r o m Buffy), but you're nonetheless left with a distinct feeling
that y o u c o u l d p r o b a b l y have written s o m e t h i n g not entriely dissimilar
given a b o u t a week. C o n s e q u e n t l y A m e r i c a n Pie is left sitting out o n
the shelf a m o n g s t the movies labelled "funny for shock value only".
There's the distinct suggestion that it's a movie best suited t o the
w o r l d of teenagers brought up o n overly-censored U S TV, rather than
to a g e n e r a t i o n of kids reared o n a diet o f M e n B e h a v i n g Badly, Bot-
t o m a n d Reeves & Mortimer.
The Faculty (video)
Ever h a d that feeling that everyone
a r o u n d y o u is f r o m a different planet?
N o t difficult t o i m a g i n e w h e n you a r e
studying at Imperial but the kids at Her-
rington H i g h weren't just i m a g i n i n g it.
After a few bizarre events, a g r o u p o f
loners, leaders a n d nerds finally discov-
er that the teachers really are f r o m a
different planet a n d it's up t o them t o
save the w o r l d f r o m a l i e n d o m i n a t i o n .
W h i l e this film has a n imaginative story
a n d fantastic (if not g r u e s o m e ) special
effects, s o m e t h i n g just doesn't work. The
story isn't d e v e l o p e d e n o u g h a n d the
characters are s h a l l o w a l t h o u g h the
actors playing t h e m are f a m o u s faces.
With a clever script f r o m Kevin
W i l l i a m s o n (Scream a n d S c r e a m 2) a n d
direction f o r m Robert R o d r i g u e z (Dusk
'til! D a w n ) , it's a case of trying t o fit too
m u c h into a n h o u r a n d a half.
But hey, that's just my o p i n i o n . If you
haven't seen this film o n the big screen
already a n d you have nothing else t o
d o this evening the g o a n d rent it. It's
g u a r a n t e e d t o m a k e y o u l a u g h a n d
squirm.
H e l e n
N o t b a d , just a little depressing.
