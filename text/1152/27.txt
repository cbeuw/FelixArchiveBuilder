Intro
W e l c o m e to this first e d i -
tion of the n e w Felix
g a m e s section. W i t h a
completely new, d e d i c a t e d
a n d enthusiastic reviewing
t e a m w e will have fair, b a l -
a n c e d reviews of all the
newest g a m e s . W e l l , that's
the plan anyway.
This week we have news o f
two u p c o m i n g c o n s o l e
innovations - the P o k e m o n
craze a n d the m u c h h y p e d
(and delayed) S e g a
D r e a m c a s t .
Personally, a s a d i e - h a r d
P C g a m e s f a n , I'm very
cynical a b o u t all the hype
s u r r o u n d i n g the D r e a m -
cast. C o n s o l e g a m e s
designers have h a d h u g e
a m o u n t s o f c o m p u t i n g
p o w e r o n their h a n d s for
years p n d in all that time I
have yet to see them p r o -
d u c e a g a m e that doesn't
feel like it was d e s i g n e d
for twelve year olds. B u t
then m a y b e that's just m e .

An entire console/internet
package for just £199?
Try finding PC value like
that!)
Dreamcast finally hits the streets
T h e g a m i n g w o r l d takes a n unretractable step forwards this month with the l a u n c h of the first 128-bit c o n s o l e , Sega's
D r e a m c a s t .
Yep, things have c o m e a l o n g way since the p i o n e e r i n g years of the 4 8 k S p e c t r u m , a c o m p u t e r that n o d o u b t brings
b a c k f o n d m e m o r i e s for many. N o l o n g e r d o we have to wait 5 minutes for a g a m e to l o a d , n o r are we c o n f i n e d to
2 D and 1 6 c o l o u r s . Despite these limitations the Spectrum o o z e d originality, playability a n d class, a n d its longevity
(over a d e c a d e ) is testament t o these qualities plus the h u g e software library that was a v a i l a b l e . Today's t e c h n o l o g y is
a d v a n c i n g faster than ever so such a lengthy lifetime is no l o n g e r likely. If the D r e a m c a s t is to flourish it must at least
m a t c h the originality of the Spectrum a n d c o n v i n c e g a m e s publishers that it deserves similar software support. O n e
n e e d only c o m p a r e the Playstation to the N 6 4 t o see that such strategies w i n . Sony capitalised o n m a r k e t i n g a n d a
wealth o f g a m e s while N i n t e n d o , w h o p r o d u c e d the far superior m a c h i n e , relied o n fewer but better quality g a m e s
and subsequently d i d not m a n a g e to capture the market majority. The D r e a m c a s t d o e s have a n extra t r u m p c a r d u p
its sleeve, that o f Internet access a n d the potential '6 billion' other players to c o m p e t e against. T h e inclusion of a
m o d e m in the c o n s o l e is great news for g a m e r s a n d will revolutionise o n l i n e g a m i n g , m a k i n g it a v a i l a b l e t o all.
Sega's p r o p a g a n d a must ensure that the Internet capability of the D r e a m c a s t is well m a r k e t e d t o win o v e r g a m e r s ,
since they only have a year before the next g e n e r a t i o n Sony a n d N i n t e n d o m a c h i n e s are d u e . U n l e s s w o w e d early
o n , it is likely that m a n y will m a k e - d o with their a g e i n g Playstation o r N 6 4 for a n o t h e r year. N e v e r forget M i c r o s o f t ,
r u m o u r has it that they will continue their m e g a l o m a n i a c e x p a n s i o n into the c o m p u t i n g w o r l d with the release of their
o w n c o n s o l e , the pants n a m e d 'X-box' at the e n d o f next year...
G r a p h i c s a r e usually a d e f i n i n g factor in g a m e s t a n d a r d , a l t h o u g h they are n o l o n g e r the be-all a n d end-all.
G a m e r s c a n n o w h o p e for stronger e m o t i o n a l i m m e r s i o n with g a m e s such a s Half-Life scaring the hell out of players
of all a g e s . A s the a v e r a g e g a m e r a g e has increased to the mid 20's a n d the o l d i m a g e o f g a m e s - 4 - g e e k s is
s h r u g g e d off we c a n a l s o h o p e for a b r o a d e r r a n g e of o l d e r a u d i e n c e , m e d i a incensing material.
Fo r n o w t h o u g h , the best we Can d o is g o out a n d buy a D r e a m c a s t or, if you're l o a d e d a n d p r e p a r e d f o r h a r d w a r e
p r o b l e m s , a t o p d o g P C . With all the d e v e l o p m e n t s in the air y o u may easily neglect Sega's latest i n c a r n a t i o n , but
this w o u l d b e a mistake a s the D r e a m c a s t really is a monster, a n d here are 1 0 reasons why:
• C o s t s the s a m e a s a decent P C graphics card - but y o u get the w h o l e m a c h i n e without compatibility hassles.
• All-inclusive M o d e m .
• The first 1 2 8 bit c o n s o l e , with u n p a r a l l e l e d
g r a p h i c s .
• W e i r d controller with L C D (Visual m e m o r y sys-
tem) screen.
• G a m e s look similar to P C prices if y o u s h o p
a r o u n d .
• 1 7 g a m e s at l a u n c h with m a n y m o r e o n the
way
• Boast a b o u t h a v i n g a m o r e powerful system
than your mates.
• Multi-player finally c o m e s o f a g e - Internet
g a m i n g a v a i l a b l e to a l l .
• 5 e m a i l addresses plus a n internet browser
• Prevent S o n y / N i n t e n d o d o m i n a t i o n - greater
c o m p e t i t i o n is better for the consumer.
