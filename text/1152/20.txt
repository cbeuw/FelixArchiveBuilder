Men.
Lovely Daughter
Epic
Lame scratching, and a
poor eighties sound
make this quite an
unlovely record. Merz
have never impressed
me much. I don't like
the look of him, and
this track certainly
doesn't have the touch.
It's like a man that feels
like a woman. Know
what I mean? Rubbish.
Ben & Jason
Air Guitar
G O ! Beat
Coming from their summer Emoti-
cons album, Air Guitar is another
classic Ben & Jason track. There's
all the usual niceness and the track
is modern day easy listening at it's
finest. Although often accused of
sounding like Radiohead in their
early days Ben & Jason are definite-
ly worth looking out for and if
you've any cash from your Student
Loan, getting your hands on this or
one of their albums wouldn't be a
bad idea.
Iggy Pop
Corruption
Virgin
A collaboration with Hollywood
heartthrob Jonny Depp, Corruption
is Iggy at his best. His singing is
harsh and precise and the tunes is
punky enough to get your bopping
just a few seconds after the disc has
begun to spin. Depp provides the
guitar riffs that accompany Iggy's
crooning, and he doesn't let his part-
ner down with a sound as crunchy
as Iggy's crispy vocals.
Pavement
Major Leagues
Domino
Pavement's recent Terror
Twilight album was sup-
posed to be the album
we had all been waiting
for. The hiring of a
producer made the
music much easier on
the ear, but sadly some-
thing was lost in the
alledged upgrade.
Major Leagues is Pave-
ment at their nicest,
and as such it's not
Pavement at their best.
Give me a slanted and
enchanted sound any
day.

Ian Brown
Love Like a Fountain
Sony
Love Like a Fountain
sings a new sound for
Mr Brown. The voice
is distorted, the beats
are electro and there's
enough squeaks and
squiggles to satisfy
even the most hungry
listener. Sadly however
all these sounds don't
add up to a classic
track, and Mr Brown
would be better off
sticking to a his trusty
guitars and drums
backing.
Embrace
Hooligan
Hut
A Beckish sound from the boys
who've been promising much for
quite some time. Hooligan is a
good track, but it's not of the stan-
dard Embrace claim to be capable
of. The guitar strumming is nice,
the singing is sweet and there's a
great yeah yeah yeah bit, but even
the extra use a kazoo doesn't lift the
sound quite high enough. Please
try harder boys.
Bernard Butler
You Must Go On
Creation
Bernard Butler must be pretty gut-
ted that he'll never make as good a
record as he did with Suede or with
collaborator David McAlmont.
Indeed for Mr Butler making music
is one of those things that should
definitely remain a group activity.
Having said that though, You Must
Go On isn't a bad tune but it is
horribly average and in a world
where we seek perfection I'm afraid
this isn't good enough.
The Charlatans
Forever
Universal
With a new album Us
& Us Only out next
week, The Charlatans
lay down the founda-
tions well with Forever.
Tim Burgess's voice
smoothly sails the
waves of funky bass
and electro keyboards
as the song cruises
through it's five minute
journey across the
stereo. This bodes well
for Us & Us Only and
I'm witing with baited
breath.
