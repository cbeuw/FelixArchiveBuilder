What is science?
T
o m a n y students r e a d i n g this,
science is t h e h a r d , d r y facts
that fill text b o o k s a n d hours
of lectures. To those i n v o l v e d in
active research it m a y b e f o u n d in
the mess a n d unpredictability of the
lab. To p h i l o s o p h e r s , t h e nature o f
science h a s always p o s e d a bit o f a
p r o b l e m ; they a r e u n a b l e most o f
the time t o a g r e e w h e t h e r the w o r l d
really exists. They find it even h a r d -
er to a c c e p t the o n e view o f t h e
world that science h a s t o o f f e r But
it is hard t o d e n y that it h a s b e e n
e x t r a o r d i n a r i l y s u c c e s s f u l a t
explaining nature.
H a s science b e c o m e a victim o f
its o w n success? To m a n y n o n - s c i -
entists, t h e ideas a n d m e t h o d s of
science r e m a i n a mystery. This lack
of u n d e r s t a n d i n g leads t o b l a c k
a n d white views o f science. F o r
s o m e , science is a s o u r c e o f u n r e -
alistic h o p e s , f o r e x a m p l e that
every disease will b e c u r e d . A n d f o r
others it is a s o u r c e o f hostility a n d
fear, l e a d i n g t o n e w p r o b l e m s o f
n u c l e a r w e a p o n s a n d g l o b a l p o l l u -
tion. W h a t is it a b o u t the nature o f
science that is s o easily m i s u n d e r -
s t o o d ?
In his b o o k "The Unnatural
Nature of Science", Lewis W o l p e r t
a r g u e s that science involves a very
unnatural w a y of thinking, totally

p a r e d t o other a r e a s of k n o w l e d g e .
These a r e very seductive ideas if
y o u a r e a scientist.
To Harry C o l l i n s a n d Trevor
Pinch, science is m o r e like a g o l e m .
The g o l e m is a creature f r o m J e w -
ish f o l k l o r e , m a d e f r o m clay a n d
b r o u g h t t o life by spells. In s o m e
legends it is given special powers t o
turn l e a d into g o l d b u t it c a n
b e c o m e d a n g e r o u s if it is not c o n -
trolled. In their b o o k "The Golem -
What Everyone should know about
Science", the authors use the a n a l -
ogy o f ' g o l e m s c i e n c e ' t o a v o i d
simplistic views of science a s a l l
g o o d o r all b a d . They believe that
h o w e v e r successful scientific t h e o -
ries a r e , science remains at heart a
h u m a n enterprise, a n d is therefore
fallible a n d untidy. " O n e c a n n o t
ask of scientists...that they b e n o
l o n g e r h u m a n " , a n d yet they a r e
expected to deliver absolute cer-
ta i nty.
There is m u c h public c o n f u s i o n
about.the w a y science is d o n e . T h e
c o l d , dispassionate scientist is s u p -
p o s e d t o b e a b o v e outside influ-
e n c e s that affect o r d i n a r y lives.
Lewis W o l p e r t suggests that s c i e n -
tists are partly to b l a m e f o r creating
this i l l u s i o n o f t h e ' s c i e n t i f i c
m e t h o d ' , b e c a u s e they write a l l
their papers as if there w a s o n e .
These tidy, i m p e r s o n a l texts, written
with t h e help o f perfect hindsight
leave n o r o o m f o r the creativity o r
doubts of the scientist. C o l l i n s a n d
Pinch believe that the w a y a m b i g u -
ous results a r e interpreted m a y
have m o r e to d o with social politics
than is generally b e l i e v e d . This is
not just a case of b a d science. They
illustrate their a r g u m e n t s with f a s c i -
nating stories f r o m the history of
science, that s h o w h o w f a r f r o m
reality is the scientific myth.
Both these b o o k s are entertain-
ingly a n d persuasively written. But
in d e c i d i n g whether science is s p e -
cial o r m o r e like a g o l e m , it is
i m p o r t a n t n o t t o c o n f u s e a r g u -
ments over m e t h o d s a n d contents.
Wolpert's e m p h a s i s is o n the find-
ings of science, it is these that h e
finds counter-intuitve. O n the other
h a n d , C o l l i n s a n d Pinch a r e c o n -
c e r n e d with h o w science is d o n e
a n d whether it bears any relation to
the scientific myth.
W o l p e r t attacks social views of
science, b e c a u s e h e thinks they a r e
irrelevant f o r w o r k i n g scientists.
C o l l i n s a n d Pinch a g r e e that t h e
i m a g e of ' g o l e m s c i e n c e ' m a y b e
unhelpful in day-to-day research.
But it is w h e n science enters t h e
public d o m a i n that it b e c o m e s d a n -
g e r o u s t o treat it a s infallible.
In t h e U K it is usual f o r the
H o m e O f f i c e t o p r o v i d e o n e s c i e n -
tist t o present forensic evidence in
court cases. This has the distorting
effect of imp ly ing that such evi-
d e n c e is impartial a n d infallible. In
recent years there have b e e n a
n u m b e r of c a s e s w h e r e terrorist
c o n v i c t i o n s w e r e o v e r t u r n e d
b e c a u s e o f d o d g y f o r e n s i c evi-
d e n c e . N o t surprisingly this h a s
s h a k e n t h e p u b l i c ' s faith in such
e v i d e n c e a n d is the result o f c l a i m -
ing t o o m u c h f o r science.
W o l p e r t a l s o worries a b o u t the
public u n d e r s t a n d i n g o f science.
H e thinks w e s h o u l d be c l e a r a b o u t
w h a t science c a n a n d c a n n o t d o .
His remedy f o r i m p r o v i n g the situa-
tion is t o t e a c h m o r e scientific facts
to the p e r s o n o n the street. C o l l i n s
a n d Pinch think this a p p r o a c h is
unhelpful w h e n t h e public h a s to
d e a l with scientific controversies. If
scientific facts a r e s u p p o s e d to
reveal a ' s p e c i a l ' type o f truth
a b o u t the w o r l d , then h o w s h o u l d
citizens react w h e n presented with
two versions of the 'truth'? If s c i e n -
tists were treated m o r e like experts
of the natural w o r l d , a n d less like
g o d s , then t h e p u b l i c c o u l d c o p e
with d i v i d e d scientific o p i n i o n , as
they d o with other expert a d v i c e .
T h e d i v i d e b e t w e e n t h e
a p p r o a c h of ' g o l e m s c i e n c e ' a n d
' s p e c i a l s c i e n c e ' t o t e a c h i n g sci-
e n c e in the c l a s s r o o m is even wider.
W o l p e r t wants m o r e e m p h a s i s o n
the unnatural nature of scientific
ideas w h e n c o m p a r e d t o c o m m o n -
sense o n e s . But confusingly, he
also wants c h i l d r e n t o s e e science
as less a l i e n . C o l l i n s a n d Pinch
h o p e that the lesson of untidy, falli-
ble ' g o l e m s c i e n c e ' c a n be learned
at a n early a g e . Teachers have a
habit of tidying u p messy experi-
mental results into the neat, scien-
tific myth in the textbook. But chil-
dren s h o u l d b e told that the p r o b -
lems of t h e c l a s s r o o m l a b , also
take p l a c e in the g r o w n - u p w o r l d of
p r o p e r scientists in white coats.
