Notes from a Big
Country
by Bill Bryson
Black S w a n £ 6 . 9 9
Bill Bryson has already cast
his eye over Britain, result-
ing in the hugely p o p u l a r
Notes From A Small Island.
N o w this genial A m e r i c a n
has returned t o the lan d o f
his birth a l o n g with his
English wife a n d c h i l d r e n .
Since returning t o the U S
he has p r o d u c e d a weekly
c o l u m n for the M a i l o n
Sunday, a n d his latest b o o k
is a n a n t h o l o g y o f these
miniature essays.
He m a n a g e s t o p o k e fun at
those ridiculous aspects of
US a n d British life in a way
which is essentially, w e l l ,
nice. There is n o other
w o r d t o describe Bill's style
(and after reading this
b o o k , you will b e o n first
n a m e terms a s well). By the
e n d of his previous b o o k I
was finding his s e l f - d e r o g a -
tory, c o n f e s s i o n a l style a lit-
tle w e a r i n g , but N o t e s
From A Big C o u n t r y lends
itself to r a n d o m dipping-in.
This w o u l d b e the perfect
p a p e r b a c k for s n e a k i n g
into lectures. H o w e v e r
there are two fatal flaws.
Firstly, at least twice in
every p a g e laughter bursts
quite uncontrollably f r o m
my m o u t h . This m a y d r a w
attention in the lecture the-
atre . Secondly, your p r o -
fessors will m a k e y o u t o
lend it to t h e m .

Steven Berkoff: the B a d Boy of British theatre. A s k i n h e a d w h o
swears a lot. H e really swears a lot. I m e a n w e are talking m a k i n g
Q u e n t i n Tarentino look like J a n e Austin. N e v e r have I visited a the-
atre a n d b e e n subject to such a raping a n d violating of the senses. A t
times ' C u n t ' was virtually a preposition. O k , so w e ' v e established that
this is not o n e t o take your G r a n n y to, but it is a play with a n u n d e r -
lying raw strength.
Indeed, a piece of theatre t o enlist a strong response, whether of
hate for it o r love for it (a " M a r m i t e " play, if you will). It is not subtle
a n d it is not pretentious, giving us a slice of life f r o m the East End,
often revealing the base instincts which lie within us a l l . W e see a l l
forms of baseness a s the characters lurch f r o m p l a c e t o p l a c e ; sexual
c o n q u e s t , racism, gluttony, incest a n d violence.
The original p e r f o r m a n c e o f this play was p e r f o r m e d in the E d i n -
b u r g h Fringe a b o u t 2 0 years a g o , in which Berkoff played the m a i n
part. T h e character w h o has taken over his role certainly h a d a lot to
live up t o , at times l o o k i n g a little w e a k e r than the others.
I d i d feel that at points in this play Berkoff was dwelling in a n d g l o r i -
fying the v i o l e n c e , w a d i n g in his misogynistic libido with n o real pur-
p o s e . H e d o e s d o this with skill a n d p o w e r but beneath all the v i o -
lence a n d F's a n d C ' s , at s o m e points the play s e e m e d empty.
T h e i m a g e r y o f the fight a n d motorcycle scenes were fantastic, c o n -
jured u p by Berkoff's torrent o f g r a p h i c l a n g u a g e a n d forceful style.
The acting was fantastic. I was in awe o f the extreme polish, intense
physical strength a n d prescence that all (and I m e a n all) the actors
g e n e r a t e d .
I will certainly g o a n d see it a g a i n . I d o certainly r e c o m m e n d it. The
play has a slick a n d astute humor, s u p p o r t e d by a l a m b e n t a n d per-
fectly timed live p i a n o music. This is a n e x a m p l e of h o w theatre c a n
be u s e d , you will b e b l o w n a w a y by its power.
