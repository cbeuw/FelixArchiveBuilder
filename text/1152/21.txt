A l Paradis
( C o d e b l u e )
A l t h o u g h the c h o i c e of
a h a r m o n i c a s o n e of
the key instruments in
this b a n g i n g tune
seems at first a little
strange the d e c i s i o n
turns o u t to be not as
m u c h as a n error as it
first s o u n d s . T h e flip
side M a t t D a r e y remix
provides further inter-
est, with this a n d the
o r i g i n a l certainly living
up the d a n c e f l o o r filler

Beth O r t o n
C e n t r a l Resen/ation
(Heavenly)
With three mixes of o n e of the best
tracks o n Beth O r t o n s M e r c u r y
M u s i c Prize n o m i n a t e d a l b u m , this
p a c k a g e ran M o b y close for single
of the week. Beth's v o i c e finds per-
fect c o m p a n y in the beats that are
a d d e d to her near perfect v o c a l
track. T h e Spiritual Life remix is the
standout a n d featured heavily in
m a n y dj charts a n d o n m a n y d a n c e -
floors over the summer. If y o u miss
out o n Beth O r t o n , you're definitely
missing out.

8 / 1 1 / 9 9
With C r o a t i a being m o r e f a m o u s for
w a r than house tunes, o n e p r o b a b l y
shouldn't expect m u c h f r o m C r o a t
national Eddy R a m i c h . A n y reserva-
tions are b l o w n a w a y by the four
tunes of Z a g r e b Cuts. The tunes are
w o r l d class with g o o d variations
across the b o a r d , to give a s o u n d
that will a p p e a l to its house music
target a n d many others besides.

The C h e m i c a l s really

J o n S p e n c e r Blues
Explosion
Heavy
(Mute)
O n l y J o n S p e n c e r c a n
m a k e music like J o n
Spencer. However, as
this time the release is
a remix H e a v y doesn't
quite s o u n d like J o n
Spencer. T h e tune
b o u n c e s a l o n g with
s o m e well t i m e d , well
thought o u t scratch
s a m p l e s a n d the tracks
o n the EP prove to b e
worth m o r e than just a
brief listening. Indeed
the s o u n d is so c o l o u r -
ful you'll have m o r e
than just the blues
p u m p i n g o n your
stereo.
T h e A l l Seeing I
T h e First M a n in S p a c e
(London)
O h dear, it seems that the A l l See-
ing I are g o i n g to be the o n e hit
w o n d e r s we never thought they'd
be. T h e First M a n in S p a c e is a
w o r l d a w a y f r o m the catchy A n d
The Beat G o e s O n a n d this is m o r e
than a s h a m e . T h e other tracks o n
the single aren't u p to m u c h either -
so I'm afraid this release will be
filed in the dustbin.

M o b y
W h y d o e s my heart feel so b a d ?
(Mute)
Perfect c o m e d o w n records are few
a n d far between these days. I've
b e e n l o o k i n g for a new tune for
s o m e time. M o b y , w h o has
c h a n g e d s o u n d m o r e often than
a n y o n e is d a n c e music w a s per-
haps the person I least expected to
p r o d u c e such a classic. W h y D o e s
M y Heart Feel S o B a d is a n instant
timeless classic. T h e p i a n o s , strings
a n d beats are perfect, a n d the
vocals f r o m a strong m a l e lead a n d
an a n g e l i c f e m a l e b a c k i n g all bring
you up f r o m whatever f a t h o m o u s
depths y o u m a y wallow. Y o u must
. o w n this r e c o r d .
Three Stars
(Milk n 2 Sugars)
A g o o d quality single
with excellent beats
a n d s o u n d s that are as
well p r o d u c e d as any-
thing y o u c a n hear.
The tunes however,
don't quite cut it as
with best at the
m o m e n t , but only hav-
ing the supertunes is
not w h a t club music is
about. G o o d for a
w a r m u p , o r a c o m e
