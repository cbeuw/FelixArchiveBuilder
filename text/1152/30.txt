Tasting Notes
Week Two : The Frying Pan
The Basic Skill
Frying
Last week, we looked at boiling, the
simplest skill of all. This week, things
get a little more complex, as w e
switch to the frying pan. Frying is a
cornerstone of British cuisine. Tradi-
tionally huge amounts of oil were
used. Frying in a pan was just a less
fat-intensive version of deep frying.
As we b e c a m e more health c o n -
scious, there has been a tendency to
reduce the amount of fat used in
cooking. This doesn't m e a n that the
frying p a n has h a d its day. Frying is
convenient, a n d because you c a n
see the f o o d it's hard to g o wrong.
To fry, you always need s o m e
kind of fat. Aside from flavour, the
most important characteristic of a
cooking fat is smoking point. This is
the temperature at which the fat
starts t o burn, producing smoke. In
general, if you reach smoking point
the temperature is t o o high.
W h e n frying, all the same heat
control rules apply a s f o r boiling.
You need to heat more vigorously
when the p a n a n d its contents are
being raised in temperature, a n d
less when you only need to maintain
temperature. T h e p a n a n d f a t
should be raised in temperature,
before the food is a d d e d . W h e n fry-
ing, you should normally maintain a
brisk sizzle. If juice is leaking out of
the f o o d , the temperature m a y b e
too low. Splattering probably means
you need to reduce temperature.
M o s t meat c a n be fried in its
own fat, o r maybe with a little butter
or olive oil. It is obvious with a quick
fork prod whether it is c o o k e d
through. Experimentation is the best
way t o learn, but b e aware that
thicker bits of meat are more tricky.
Meal Suggestion
Saute Potatoes
This is easy, but not quick. It makes
a really tasty lunch, o r light meal.
You really need to use waxy pota-
toes, as o p p o s e d to the usual floury
types. Sometimes called salad pota-
toes, waxy potatoes have a creamy
texture. C o m m o n varieties include
Charlotte a n d Ratte. M o s t new pota-
to varieties also seem to be alright
here, including the really cheep
ones, o f unspecified variety, which
most supermarkets sell loose.
Prepare a m e d i u m onion by
c h o p p i n g into fairly small bits. Heat
a splash of olive oil a n d a knob of
butter gently in a frying p a n , a n d
a d d the onion. Fry slowly f o r a few
minutes, until the onion is soft, but
not brown. C h o p about 1 5 0 g of
potato per person into slices of
about half a centimetre thick, then
turn the heat u p slightly a n d a d d to
the p a n . Sprinkle a teaspoon of a
robust herb (such as Rosemary o r
Thyme) over the mixture, then stir.
Turn the heat d o w n so that y o u
c a n hear only the tiniest sound of fry-
ing, then leave for the best part of a n
hour. If possible, try to cover the
pan. W h e n you return, a d d some
c h o p p e d cheese, ideally something
more adventurous than just ched-
dar. Wait for a couple of minutes
while the cheese melts, then serve
Advanced Tip
Glazed Vegetable Chips
Fried vegetable chips are very inter-
esting visually. I use a combination
of carrot with about half the quanti-
ty of parsnip. C h o p the vegetables
into really thin strips, perhaps only a
few millimetres thick. Heat a p a n of
water, a n d blanch the vegetables for
a few minutes. You may need to d o
this in small batches, to ensure that
the temperature of the water doesn't
drop too low. Fish the vegetables out
with a slotted s p o o n , a n d dry them
off by heating briefly o n their own in
a frying p a n . This ensures that they
fry easily.
Turn the vegetables out of the
p a n , a n d heat e n o u g h nut oil to
coat them. A d d the vegetables back
in, with about half a tablespoon per
person of d e m e r a r a sugar. Fry m o d -
erately hard for about 1 0 minutes.
By the end of this time, the parsnips
should be fairly brown, a n d the car-
rot just slightly black.
Take the p a n off the heat, a d d
a lump of butter, then serve beside
a main dish.
