Were they ready for the launch?
A p a r t f r o m the m i l l e n i u m parties, the most talked a b o u t h a p p e n i n g s in
c l u b culture this y e a r were the o p e n i n g of t w o n e w Superclubs here in
L o n d o n . It w a s billed a s heavyweight battle with both clubs with dif-
ferent strengths, but both with the s a m e g o a l ; t o give the title o f Britain
biggest a n d best c l u b t o L o n d o n . Until this a u t u m n it w a s widely
r e g a r d e d that that title lay with Liverpool f o r C r e a m , o r Sheffield f o r
G a t e c r a s h e r . F o r a n y o n e w h o shouts Ministry of S o u n d , all I'd say is:
have y o u b e e n t o C r e a m ?
A n y w a y b a c k t o the battle. In o n e c o r n e r it w a s m u c h hyped h o m e , o f
h o m e l a n d s f a m e a n d with n o capital letter. A Leicester S q u a r e l o c a -
tion a n d b e i n g set o v e r a massive seven h o m e m e a n t business. A l s o
a p r o m i s e o f a strict d o o r policy to keep it a club f o r clubbers rather
than the r a n d o m lost l o o k i n g tourists w h o normally inhabit the Square.
In the other c o r n e r w a s Fabric. Set in F a r r i n g d o n a n d with a g e n e r o u s
w e e k l o n g license i n c l u d i n g a 2 4 h r music a n d d a n c i n g license f r o m
Thursday t o Sunday, it l o o k e d like Fabric w a s the perfect partner t o
h o m e t o ensure a battle that p u s h e d both contenders t o their limits.
Sadly t h o u g h , after m o r e than just a c o u p l e fuck ups the battle is yet to
b e g i n !
h o m e (yes, even here with a small letter) o p e n e d u p o n time, but there
was e x p o s e d b u i l d i n g work still g o i n g o n a n d a n u m b e r o f other
teething p r o b l e m s . Fabric, however, didn't even get it's d o o r s o p e n f o r
the l a u n c h party! A pretty p o o r s h o w i n g t h e n , which w a s a definite
s h a m e , but I'm sure that w h e n the battle d o e s c o m m e n c e it will well
worth it. Frequency will b e previewing the d e l a y e d Fabric l a u n c h next
w e e k , a n d w h e n visits have b e e n p a i d t o the respective venues y o u will
be a b l e t o r e a d a b o u t the firsty r o u n d o f the battle here. T h e story
