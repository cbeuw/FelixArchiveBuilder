c l o u d e d my view of a n

There's tracks f r o m the
Dirty Beatniks, the w o n -

even the superb History
Repeating f r o m the Pro-
pellerheads which has
stood the test of time

The tracks r a n g e f r o m

is really the newer tracks
that a r e the better, This
isn't a b a d thing for the

Euphoria Morning
(A&M Records)
It's b e e n a c o u p l e of years since S o u n d g a r d e n split u p , a n d E u p h o r i a
M o r n i n g is the first s o l o record f r o m their f o r m e r f r o n t m a n C h r i s C o r -
nell. He's m o v e d f r o m Seattle to Los A n g e l e s a n d taken his time to
p r o d u c e a n a l b u m that's b e e n hotly anticipated by both fans a n d the
m u s i c press.
Musically, this is a m u c h m o r e laid b a c k a n d bluesy affair than his
last band's output, a n d m o r e of a s h o w c a s e for his o w n talents. It's
mellow, but often e p i c in s c o p e , with swirling keyboards c o m p l e m e n t -
ing a nicely m o d u l a t e d guitar s o u n d . There's a large bit of sonic
diversity but the overall g e n e r a l feel of the music is fairly consistent.
It's pleasant to listen t o , a n d uplifting, in a n easy-going kind of way.
The a l b u m ranges f r o m the s o l o , acoustic Sweet Euphoria, to m o r e
richly layered (courtesy of p r o d u c t i o n f r o m C o r n e l l a n d b a n d m a t e s
N a t a s h a S h n e i d e r a n d A l a i n Johannes) s o u n d s of Flutter Girl. First
single Can't Change Me o p e n s a n d (in French) closes the a l b u m , a
lovely s o n g with a great chorus, a n d o n e of the m o r e accessible
tracks. Steel Rain, the last p r o p e r track, is a l s o the longest, not quite
a n epic, but l o n g e n o u g h to fit in a l o n g e r s o l o than most others;
quite a nice o n e , t o o . T h e w h o l e a l b u m has a bit of a n e p i c feel -
not d r a w n o u t , but impressive in s c o p e a n d a m b i t i o n .
Cornell's lyrics c o v e r the well-trodden g r o u n d of love, loss, h o p e a n d
faith. They're m o r e p e r s o n a l a n d intimate than S o u n d g a r d e n ' s , a n d
their tone is m e l a n c h o l i c , even depressing if y o u read them a l o n e .
Despite this, the s o n g s are upbeat a n d inspiring, hinting at the
e u p h o r i a of the record's title.
T h e finished product is a bit of a masterpiece, really. There are n o
b a d s o n g s , a n d nothing that c o u l d really be c o n s i d e r e d filler material
(with the possible exception of the French version of Can't C h a n g e
M e , a l t h o u g h this is m o r e of a b o n u s track). It's consistently g o o d ,
rather than being f o c u s e d o n a c o u p l e of o b v i o u s singles. A l l in all
well worth a l o o k .

W h a t c a n y o u say a b o u t T o m "Taffy"
J o n e s ? H e s d o n e the lot, w o r s h i p e d by
Elvis, courted by Sinatra a n d b e e n b o m -
b a r d e d by countless items of ladies
underwear. H e w a s tootling a l o n g nicely
being a classic performer. But thats not
g o o d e n o u g h - he has to be d o w n with
the kids t o o now. W h i l e the acts
involved are of a high c a l i b e r (general-
ly)
The best s o n g o n this a l b u m of duets
a n d c o l l a b o r a t i o n s is the o n e y o u have
already p r o b a b l y h e a r d . " B u r n i n g d o w n
the h o u s e " with T h e C a r d i g a n s is a
great c o v e r of a Talking H e a d s track.
N o t h i n g else really c o m e s close - "Little
G r e e n B a g " with the Bare N a k e d ladies
is a pretty hard s o n g to c o v e r badly -
they a l m o s t m a n a g e it. "Baby, it's c o l d
o u t s i d e " gains marks f o r Cerys's i m p o s -
sibly throaty v o i c e , a n d 5 0 ' s t h r o w b a c k
p r o d u c t i o n a n d the classic lyrics. W h i l e
most of the acts o n the a l b u m are pretty
m a i n s t r e a m performers - Portishead are
definitely a little off the b e a t e n track.
Their c o l l a b o r a t i o n with T o m is a c o v e r
of " M o t h e r l e s s C h i l d " . Eminetly suitable
for their g l o o m y p r o d u c t i o n a n d Toms
w a r b l i n g .
Apart f r o m the tracks f r o m T h e C a r d i -
g a n s a n d Portishead I w o u l d most defi-
nitely u n l o a d this h e i n o u s c o m p i l a t i o n .
