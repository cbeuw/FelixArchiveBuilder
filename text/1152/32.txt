We operate a true meritocracy.
From your first day we'll expect
to see qualities which go beyond
the academic.
We want to see the confident
communication of complex ideas
and the depth of character
required for early responsibility.
We want to know that you can
make things happen.
Having first experienced one of
investment banking's finest
education programmes, new
graduates will choose from a
wide range of career options
across international locations.
Further opportunities for
development will continue as
your career takes off.
But you won't be held back by
bureaucratic structures.
If you think you can make an
immediate contribution in a
highly demanding environment,
then take this opportunity to
speak with us.
