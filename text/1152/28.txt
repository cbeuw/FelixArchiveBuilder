This Friday sees this year's first
show from the Union's acclaimed
Bust-a-Gut comedy line-up, which
over the course of the last few
year's has featured some of the
hottest new names on the national
circuit, alongside established acts
and Open Mic competitions.
To give you a taster of what's in
store, we've teamed up with pro-
moters Avalon to profile the line up
week by week, so you can get a feel
for whether or not to take Granny
along with you. We've also got
details of this year's Open Mic
competition for those of you who
think you could do better, and later
in the term we'll be bringing you
advance details of special offers,
prize draws and giveaways. For
now, however, lets look at this
week's line-up:
Lucy Potter
Since reaching the finals of
1995's "So you think you're
funny?" contest, Lucy has been
tipped by many as a face of the
future, thanks to her family-friendly
(but nonetheless funny) routines
and an impressive list of TV credits.
Chris Addison
Something of a favourite at
Imperial, Chris played here twice
last year, going down a storm with
his mixture of intelligent, student
orientated gags, domineering
approach and. love of Star Wars
Lego.
O p e n M i c A w a r d 2000
The Daily Telegraph award is
Britain's biggest stand-up competi-
tion, with victory universally provid-
ing an instant push into the stand-
up elite (plus £2000 and spots at
the Melbourne and Montreal com-
edy festivals). Anyone can enter,
provided they have never.been paid
for a stand-up gig, are over 16 and
have the determination to get out
on stage and prove their comic cre-
dentials to an unsuspecting audi-
ence.
To enter, just send your name
address and phone number to :
Daily Telegraph Open Mic Award,
PO Box 13048,
London Wl 0 6WQ
Good luck - hope to see you at the
semi-finals next May.

Later this month the Union plays
host to a local heat of the
DJ2000 competition, but what
the hell is it?
Well, it's designed as a
chance for every bedroom DJ to
stop messing about in their room
and get out there and earn some
serious money. Contestants from
across the country will be given
the chance to show what they're
made of and, even if they don't
win they'll meet the right people
and gain loads of good contacts.
One student from the IC heat
will be chosen to go through to
the regional final in November or
December, and the final will take
place next January in front of a
judging panel of high-profile
musical types (DJs, press, record
execs etc) who .will select one
overall winner to be crowned top
student DJ for the new millenni-
The winner will then take
away £1000, a set of Vestax
Decks & mixers, an agency deal
and guaranteed bookings. The
runners up will pick up cash and
Vestax goodies.
The sponsors of the competi-
tion are Red (the new alcopop
infused with organic stimulants to
keep you going) and Juice mag-
azine. So say thank you. Good.
