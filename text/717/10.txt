2 CAVING CLUB
Caving Club are one of the
College's most active clubs. In the
last two years major caves in Peru
and France have been explored. In
this article Harry Lock describes
some of the clubs activities.
Exploring the many
subterranean passages,
chambers and shafts that
exist in limestone areas has
many attractions; this short
article explains some of
these, and describes the
activities of the college
Caving Club.
The main attraction is the
unique nature of the cave
environment with the
chance to see spectacular
formations on all scales,
from fragile straw-like
few people are ever likely
to go. Until one has been
caving several times, it is
hard to describe adequately
the various inner feelings of
excitement, exhilaration,
exhaustion, apprehension,
and achievement that may
confront the caver before,
during or after a trip.
'The cave is not a lifeless
place, it is a living thing to
which we have to give
ourselves; a thing that can
be gentle and also be a
stalactites crowded on the
roof of a chamber, to large
stalagmite bosses many
metres high, rising dome-
like off the floor. During a
journey underground, the
caver may well have to
crawl, climb, squeeze, swim
or just walk through
passages that may vary in
height from 20cm to that of
a small block of flats. The
most memorable parts of a
cave system are usually the
vertical shafts which can
only be descended by rope
or ladder, often trying as
best as possible to avoid
the full force of a
spectacular underground
waterfall. Always there is
the knowledge that you are
exploring parts of the
underground world where
either no person has been
before, or where relatively
savage whose changes in
temper can render it
dangerous. And the harder
it treats us, the happier we
are to master it and make it
ours'.
For many, one attraction
is that caving is, without
doubt, a strenuous sport,
requiring fitness and
stamina. As in other sport,
physical performance can
be improved by increasing
the frequency of cavings,
and by other activities,
such as running,
swimming, and climbing.
Your own commitment to
the sport will decide what
fitness level you aim for.
Though the British caving
scene is at present
undoubtedly male
dominated, this is not to
say that opportunities for
women are limited—indeed
what they may lack in brute
strength, they generally
gain in a naturally higher
power to weight ratio,
which leads to fitter, agile,
and ultimately safer way of
caving.
There is a considerable
amount of satisfaction to
be gained from the safe
and effective use of the
various items of
hardware—Karabiners,
descendeurs, prussiks and
ropes, and it is really up to
the individual how much
interest is taken in
techniques and equipment,
providing the caving
methods actually used are
quiet safe. The club has a
modern outlook in the
equipment and techniques
area—all new members are
introduced to single rope
techniques (SRTL) in the
first term of their joining,
and once a year a 2 day
course at the National Cave
Training Centre is held for
all interested people.
Nevertheless the traditional
methods of ladder and line,
when used, are also
practised as safely as
possible. Equipment is also,
unfortunately, the major
expense incurred by both
new and estalished
members. Although we can
lend wetsuits, oversuits and
specialist hardware for the
first few trips, a keen
novice wil usually want to
start to buy a set of
personal gear, simply for
reasons of comfort and
convenience.
The standard of club
caving has improved
dramatically over the last 2
years and, with a recent
highly successful
expedition to Peru, and 3
consecutive summer tours
to the French Alps, there is
a core of committed and
.experienced cavers willing
to train and take
underground any keen new
members.
A typical club weekend
departs from London on
Friday evening, and arrives
in the caving area later that
night. We stay in local
caving club huts, which
provide bunkbed
accommodation, cooking
and washing facilities, and
often have hot showers
upon return from the cave.
Caving trips are organised
on the Saturday and
Sunday, usually visiting the
local pub on the Saturday
night, when there is a
chance to relax and discuss
the days caving over a few
pints. Return to London is
made on the Sunday night.
This year, the emphasis on
caving in the Yorkshire
Dales has been increased,
but not to the exclusion of
several trips to South
Wales, Mendips, and
Derbyshire. The main
highlights of the year are
the Easter and Summer
Tours. This year the club
hopes to visit Ireland at
Easter, and a number of
ideas for the summer are
under consideration at
present purely social events
are the Christmas and
Annual Dinner in Yorkshire.
The annual Dinner is held
on the May Bank Holiday,
when the election for
Committee posts is held
and the drinking and
games last well into the
night.
If you think you might be
interested in going caving,
the club has its weekly
meetings on Wednesdays
at 1pm in the Union Lower
Lounge, when plans for the
forthcoming caving trip are
finalised. We look forward
to seeing you.
