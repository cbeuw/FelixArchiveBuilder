IC 2nd XI 2 OMT 4
After losing the toss and
being forced to play into
the sun, IC made a brilliant
start, in which they were
extremely unlucky not to
score. Then the Old Men in
Trousers thundered down
the pitch and forced a short
corner, from which they
scrambled a goal.
Immediately from the
restart, IC took control and
ran rings around the
opposition's defence, Dave
Whitton putting the
finishing touch to a well-
worked build up.
Unfortunately, being the
first game of the season, IC
lacked the team work
needed and OMT scored
another couple of
fortuitous goals again from
short corners. IC struck
back when Nick Hope
scored the second goal and
also ruptured the
goalkeeper's spleen in the
process, but after the
interval, due to being
knackered, and to a bit of
dodgy refereeing from
Drunken 'No 4 Sheep
Shears' Wigney, IC
conceded another goal
totally against the run of
play. In all it proved to be a
good start to the season
against tough opposition.

ICHC 3rd XI vs QMC
Last Saturday saw the
thirds continue their
success of last season with
a good performance
against QMC.
During the first half,
despite having only ten
men, IC dominated from
the start. This early
pressure being rewarded
with several short corners,
one of which led to a goal
by 'ex' and 'acting' captain
Chris.
At half time with our lead
intact the team talk resulted
in Harley, our goalie,
changing position to left
inner and being replaced
by a kicking back.
Unfortunately, despite this
extra forward we were
unable to increase our lead,
and after several 'scares' in
the defence we finished the
game dominant.
In the end it was just
another victory for the
thirds (how boring!).
Team: Harley, Miles,
Dave, Richard, Vernon, Ian.

IC 6—Lensbury (A) 6
IC made a solid start to the
new season against a side
which has often had the
better of Imperial in the
past. The best performance
on the home side came
from Allan Bosewell,
winning both of his frames
in his first match for the
team. Although losing his
first frame Leroy Wint
provided the highest break
of the night with a tally of
31 helping him to secure
the second frame for
Imperial.
With Dave and John each
winning more frames it was
left to Victor Adamson
(yours truly) to provide the
worst miss of the night. A
miss on a relatively simple
chance of the final black
gave my Lensbury
opponent the frame and
allowed the opposition to
narrow the score to 5-4.
It was then that team
captain Adrian Feasby's
match against the Lensbury
No 1 provided the most
tension of the evening with
both frames being decided
on the final black, Adrian
won the first frame and at
the end of the second with
the score tied the black
was respotted . Both
players then had good
chances to take the frame
but as is usual on these
occassions, several
chances went begging
before the Lensbury player
put the black down to
share the honours with
Adrian one frame apiece.

IC 1st XI 2 - U C 1st XI 1
IC started the new football
season full of optimism on
Wednesday against old
rivals UC. Suitably inspired
by Laurence Covin's choice
of underwear IC started
well and soon had UC on
the defensive. Despite UC's
questionable defensive
tactics IC took the lead
after 25 minutes when the
opposition keeper was
penalised under the new
rules. An indirect free kick
was awarded just inside the
box. Alex Lunghi floated
the ball to the far post
where Shaun Thomas
headed powerfully home, 1-
0.
IC continued to press
forward in the second half
i,.creasing their lead with a
Guy Poppy chip from 20
yards out.
IC eased off in the last 15
minutes allowing UC back
into the game with Nick
Tarm producing a fingertip
save to keep the score at 2-
0.
Slack defensive work
from a corner led to UC
scoring with about five
minutes to go.
Overall an encouraging
start to the season team.

QMC 1st 0—IC 1st 0
IC's final pre-season
friendly proved to be an
uninspiring affair against
last season's cup winners
and league runners up,
QMC.
It was a match totally
dominated by defences
with both sides struggling
to create any openings.
Q M C had a goal
disallowed in the second
half for offside which,
together with one shot that
was way off target, was the
sum total of goal attempts
in the game.
Laurence Covill and Rob
Clarke had excellent games
at the heart of IC's defence
despite Rob's attempts at
losing his and the team's
kit at every opportunity.

IC 1st XV 26 UC 1st XV 11
Despite being given every
opportunity to make a
prompt start last
Wednesday's game against
UC was, as usual, delayed
by some 20 minutes owing
to a fine display of defiance
in the face of the boycott
by the Kit, which somehow
got separated from its
erstwhile custodian Rob
Hargrove, the captain, and
slipped past the pickets
into the Union Bar.
The team arrived at
Harlington unaware of the
scab within their ranks, or
should I say the scab not
within their ranks as it was
still in the bar.
Hargrove acted
swiftly—showing true
qualities of leadership, he
appointed someone to
appoint someone else to
appoint Phil Clarke the
third team medisport man,
to commandeer a hockey
team members car to
retrieve the offending strike
breaking kit.
IC got off to a slow start,
falling three nil down very
early on, but then fought
back through the first try of
the season by Michael
Anderson in his first game
for IC. Owen 'Noddy' Miles
Chem Eng. 7th year then
added two more tries, M
Anderson converting one.
IC led 14-3 at halftime.
IC then started the
second half as they did the
first and UC came back
with a try to trail to a 26-7
lead with further tries from
John Blithes and Paul
Seccombe, M Anderson
converting both. IC then
went to sleep and UC
scored a late consolation
try. The final score being
26-11 to IC.
