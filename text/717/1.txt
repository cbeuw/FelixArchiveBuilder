Professor Manny Lehman,
emeritus professor of
Computing at IC, has
signed a contract with a
company called Science
Applications to work on
the US Strategic Defence
Initiative, better known as
the Star Wars Programme.
Professor Lehman is
believed to be the first
British academic to sign
such a contract.
Professor Lehman told FELIX
that SDI research is absolutely
essential to the future of
mankind. Politicians, he says,
will not accept that SDI is
impossible until it has been
proved by research. The
research programme will also
have enormous benefits for
society.
Other members of the
department are less convinced
of the benefits of SDI research.
They believe that SDI will
increase the risk of accidental
nuclear war. Ten members of
the Department of Computing,
including Professors Aleksander
and Kowalski, were among
academics who signed a letter
sent to Vice President George
Bush saying that an SDI system
'cannot be designed and cannot
be built'.
Professor Bruce Sayers, Head
of Department, told FELIX that
he didn't think SDI would work
and that he was worried that
SDI research might result in
scarce resources being diverted
away from other projects.
Porn Night
Hammered
College Secretary John Smith
spoke out against the RSM Hon
Porn's Night during Debsoc's
'Question Time' debate on
Monday. In one of the strongest
ever official statements about
the event, Mr Smith said that
the College administration was
firmly opposed to Hon Porn's
Night being held, but preferred
to leave the students' Union to
itself whenever possible.
Mr Smith was discussing the
public image of IC, and was
particularly concerned about
the number of women students
who choose to come to the
college. He was pleased that
RSMU had 'decided not to hold'
Hon Porn's Night last year, after
protestors had generated a
large amount of adverse
publicity.
The rest of the debate was
dominated by the political
squabblings of the other
panellists and the chairman.
The discussion covered a wide
range of issues, including South
Africa, Northern Ireland, Trade
Unions, education, and the
Third World. Consoc Chairman
Graham Brown and ex-ICU
President Piers Corbyn each
strove hard to make a more
outlandish statement than the
other. Mr Brown said that it was
a waste of time to send Live Aid
funds to the starving in Africa
and stressed that Britain should
concentrate on developing trade
links with the Third World. Mr
Corbyn said that the only way
forward was to organise a
revolution in each developing
country. Danny Finkelstein,
chairman of the young SDP, did
his best to attack Mr Brown and
Mr Corbyn to an equal degree.
Chairman Sarah Kirk made
several caustic jibes about her
guests, and John Smith stared
at the ceiling.
ttOOT F O B Y O I H !
Today sees the release of a new
venture from an offshoot of
Beano Enterprises-HOOT! This
revolutionary publication is
tipped to replace it's forerunner
if the launch is successful.
Beano President, Mr D Menace,
was unavailable for comment,
although Vice-President
Gnasher was spotted in Hyde
Park, manoeuvring his hindleg
over a copy of the HOOT press
release. Instigator of the
magazine, 'Cuddles-The
Tear away Tot', told FELIX he is
confident that HOOT will be of
great interest to IC students,
and invites comment from Aero
Engineering on the Free 'Space
Spinner' in issue 3. FELIX Editor
Hugh Southey is also very
enthusiastic about the project.
