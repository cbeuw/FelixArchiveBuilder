No Trouble
Trouble was avoided at the
RCS Chemistry Dinner on
Friday night. A group of
non IC students, obviously
the worse for drink, tried to
gate-crash a post-dinner
drinking session in the
Bot-Zoo common room.
They were turned away
quietly by a few well built
members of the
Department.
Geoffrey Reeves, Chief
Secuirty Officer,
considered this a minor
incident, but took the
opportunity to explain
some improved security
measures. Since the
beginning of term, entry to
many Union events has
been under better control.
Mr Reeves said that the
presence of nonstudents at
the party could have been
detrimental to the usage of
the college's public
performance and dancing
license. Union card checks
are now being enforced
where possible to ensure
that only IC students/staff,
and other members of the
University of London and
bona-fide guests are
allowed into future events.
Members of the Association of Scientific, Technical and
Managerial Staffs (ASTMS) gathered in Prince Consort
Road last Tuesday as part of a day of protest over
University Technicians' pay. The demonstration took the
form of a motorcade, commenced at midday and took in
six other University sites before its conclusion in Russel
Square, where General Secretary Clive Jenkins addressed
his members. Mr Jenkins, pictured here with fellow
members, has since sent a letter of protest to the
committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals.

Bar committee. There was
some dispute over the
interpretation of the bar
prices policy as agreed
between ex-ICU Deputy
President Christine Teller
and former refectory
manager Victor Mooney. As
a result the pricing issue
has been referred back to
the next meeting of the
committee.
Bar price crusader
Gareth Fish presented the
meeting with his own price
list, which he had
calculated on the basis of
his understanding of the
Teller-Mooney agreement.
College Financial Secretary
Brian Lloyd Davies and
refectory manager Rob
Northey made it clear that
they had a different
interpretation of the
agreement. Mr Northey told
FELIX that to cut prices to
the level recommended by
Mr Fish would be
detrimental to a 'solvent
trading situation'.
Mr Nothey has appointed
Mr Tony McVey to run the
Union Bar for a
probationary period. Mr
McVey previously worked
in the refectories, but Mr
Northey confirmed that he
was suitably experienced in
bar and cellar management.
ICU President Carl
Burgess will be discussing
proposals for the Union Bar
and Union Building with
college Secretary John
Smith and Brian Lloyd
Davies next week.

No Kitchens
Residents of Tizard and
Selkirk Halls are being
asked to sign a petition
objecting to modifications
to Southside kitchen
facilities.
The petition will be
forwarded to Peter
Hallworth, Managing
Surveyor of Residences. Mr
Hallworth has suspended
work in Selkirk and Tizard
Halls, whilst he considers
the hall Committee's
viewpoint.
In Falmouth Keogh Halls
no opposition was voiced
to staircase kitchens, when
the warden, Dr Paul Jowitt,
held a hall meeting last
Friday.
No Money
During the University of
London Graduation
Ceremony in the Albert
Hall on Wednesday, Lord
Flowers, ex-rector (1972-
85), attacked the University
Grants Committee (the
Major Source of University
funds). He criticised the
U G C in the presence of
Princess Anne for the low
level of University Budgets.
He said that 'the U G C
'makes no allowance for
excellence in teaching', and
claimed that this was due
to the committee's inability
to measure teaching
stardards.
It is interesting to note
that his attack follows
recent crticism of the same
teaching standards by
prominent members of the
student body.
No Success
Imperial College were
knocked out in the final of
the UAU Bar Boycott
competition earlier this
week. Despite widespread
support for the seven
days of abstinence, IC
could not fight off the
challenge from Brunei
University who organised
a one-day 'lightening
boycott' before the start
of term. Union President
Carl Burgess said that he
was naturally
disappointed with the
result, but added that he
was proud of his team for
getting as far as they did.
