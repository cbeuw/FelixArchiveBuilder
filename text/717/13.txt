This year's London Dance
Umbrella promises to be
the most successful since
their first modest festival in
1978. Some 60 separate
performing groups are
involved in an event lasting
until Christmas, spread
around venues all over
London. The festival started
last week with New York's
innovative Pick Up
Company, choreographed
by David Gordon.
The company's three new
works, Nine Lives,
Offenbach Suite and My
Folks, all suffered from a
dissapointing lack of
coherence. Offenbach Suite
accompanied by a sadly
mediocre cello duet,
consisted entirely of slow
and disjointed study
exercises for which the
dancers, obliquely
scattered across the floor,
expressed little enthusiasm.
Nine Lives and My Folks
were a little more ordered,
(the latter using some
excellent lighting and
colour effects with striped
cloths, designed by Power
Boothe)and allowed greater
versatility to the players.
Yet, despite these
attributes, the mournful
gravity of the company,
expressed not only in their
movements, but in their
costume and attitude also,
provided a dismally
uninspired peice of dance.
BOOKS
Maia. Richard Adams.
Richard Adams' latest
excursion into the realm of
human fiction has either
proved that he has a
greater affinity for animals
than people or that his well
of invention has dried up.
The book is full of the type
of gratuitous
sex'n'sensationalism only
used by bad authors
desperate for sales. Having
said that, the slobs among

buy it and try to discover
the juicy bits. Well—you'll

The three films reviewed
this week probably say
something about the
current state of the cinema
industry. One is a revival,
one is a remake and one is
utterly risible.
The revival is, however, a
worthy one. Paul Newman
is Fast Eddy, The Hustler
a pool whizz-kid who, with
his stooge, Jake La Motta,
travels around conning
fellow players in order to
raise money for the big
showdown with Minnesota
Fats.
unfair to describe Pale
Rider as a remake, but its
strong similarities with
Shane and High Plains
Drifter edo convey a strong
sense of deja vu.
In this western, the evil,
greedy baddie, Richard
Dysart, whose techniques
in diplomacy are as brutal
as his hydraulic mining
methods, is trying to force
a small dedicated

Lifeforce.
For a modern generation
brought up on a diet of
television designed to
accomodate the smallest
attention span, Robert
Rossen's 34 year old film is
probably a little slow. The
carefully controlled pace
however, (the editor is
Dede Allen; she's still
editing films today - good
to see some successful
women in the business),
does allow the fine cast
time to develop their
characters, and
perserverance is rewarded,
if only, for the rapport
between Newman and
Scott.
It's probably slightly

lengthy. The characters are
cardboard sterotypes, there
is prevalent sexism and I
imagine that only people
who find their current lives
unrewarding and dull will
gain satisfaction from
reading this grandiose
fantasy.

Therese. Francois Mauriac.
In spite of being somewhat
long winded, the
conception of this book is
brilliant. It concerns
Therese Desqueyroux, (No,
I can't pronouce it either)
born into a rural French
community. Having been
acquitted of attempting to
prospering group to leave
their settlement.
It is on a trip to the local
town, populated by thugs,
that one of the more
stubborn of the group, a
courageous wimp
engagingly played by
Michael Moriarty, is saved
from another beating by a
mysterious stranger, (no
prizes for guessing, Clint
Eastwood). His arrival
encourages the group to
stay on and causes the
Richard Dysart to call in a
group of mercenaries led
by Johgn Russell, with
whom the stranger has a
score to settle.
Because the baddies
murder Bernard, her
sexually perverted
husband, her childhood
and schooldays, when she
knew a type of innocence,
are displayed by Mauriac
as if they were a kind of
attonement. The book
follows her through her
later career in Paris; she
specialised in seducing
young men. It cuts through
the facades of wealth and
comparitive poverty, and
gaity and madness to show
the tortured soul of
Therese. Until she is near
her death she seemed
unable to commit anything
other than evil. This story
will shake any readers out
of a cosy conviction that
aren't really sufficiently
wicked, their come-
uppance does not provoke
the wild cheering in the
aisles that it should, but
elsewhere, particularly on
his first appearance, Clint
manipulates the audiences
emotions with skill. The
superb photography by
Bruce Sergees and the
sexual tension between
Clint and the two leading
women, Sydney Penny and
Corrie Snodgrass, raises
the film above the ordinary
western.
Lifeforce has such
adreadful script, culled
from all the worst 50's
science-fiction B-features,
that it is almost funny.
Apart from that it is abismal
gynophobic garbage. It is
adisaster movie, not only
because it involves mass
death and destruction, (of a
form not unlike fast-acting
AIDS), but also because it
is a disaster, of a
dangerous and obscene
kind. Still I hear it broke
tne box office record at
Leicester Square. So what
do I know?.
On a lighter note, I would
like to mention the
completion of a new
cinema, an all too rare
event.The Metro is an
atractive peice of post-
modernist architecture and
in spite of looking as
though it was still being
built, it opened last week
with Dim-Sum and Je Vous
Salue Marie, to be reviewed
next week.
they are sinless.

Life and times of Michael K J
M Coetzee, (winner of the
Booker Prize).
A slightly pretentious book
— though I suppose that's
allowed if you've won the
Booker Prize. About a man
who, due to his malformed
face, lived out the
philosophy 'man is an
island'. Due to this he was
able to cope more easily
than others with the trauma
of civil war and
imprisonment in a camp,
and challenges somewhat
the readers attitudes to
disabled or disfigured
people. A fairly good book.
