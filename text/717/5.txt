Bones Laid Bare
Debbie Wilkes looks at a new electric analysis system to
aid the study of childhood bone development.
Determination of the
skeletal maturity of children
is of great value in
diagnosing growth related
disorders, and for giving a
general indication of
physical development. Dr R
King and Dr A Kwabwe,
from the Electrical
Engineering Department,
are working in conjunction
with Professor J Tanner of
the Institute of Child Health
to develop a new fully
automated system which
will assess skeletal maturity
with great accuracy.
The most convenient way
of assessing skeletal
maturity involves
monitoring the bones of the
hand and wrist. Each bone
shows a sequence of
recognisable stages along
it's developmental path,
and attains a reasonably
constant final shape.
Straightforward
measurements of stature
can't be used, because of
the natural variation in final
adult heights attained. At
present the assessment is
carried out by highly skilled
physicians, who analyse
the X-ray of the child's
hand to obtain the value for
skeletal maturity. This value
can then be compared with
the normal value for a child
in their age group. This
process, however, is time
consuming, and frequently
imprecise. When the new
system is completed it will
provide an objective
assessment, with greater
reproducibility, greater
accuracy, and which can
be obtained by unskilled
staff.
The new system will take
the X-ray of the hand and
digitise it to give a 2,000 by
1,000 array of pixcels,
having 256 grey levels.
Then edge detection and
enhancement technique
will be used to identify the
edges of the bones, so that
they can be labelled and
their positions recorded.
The system will then
concentrate only those
bones that give the most
accurate information, in

Fig, 1 these are the bones
shaded. Each individual
bone can be classified into
one of eight stages from A
to 1, with each stage
having significant features
which are used for
identification. The
knowledge base used for
this detailed evaluation is
based on a standard
classification devised by
Professor Tanner, using
clinical experience. An
example of the kind of
image that the system uses
for classfication can be
seen in Fig 2; which shows
an edge detected picture of

a radius and it's
mataphysics, at stage G of
development. Finally, an
overall maturity assessment
can be obtained using a
weighted sum of the scores
from each separate bone.
A major advantage of this
system is that it can
interpolate between stages,
for instance, it could give a
final assessment as 90%
towards F and 10% towards
G, whereas a physician
would only state either F or
G. This is particularly
important if the child is
suffering from a hormone
imbalance, as it gives an
accurate measure of the
extent of the problem.
So far, the system has
been perfected for the
radius bone, and the
techniques developed can
now be applied to the other
bones. The ultimate aim is
to produce an automated
system which will take an
X-ray , process it fully, and
then produce a value for
skeletal maturity.
Visas While You
Wait
Any Overseas Student
whose visa expires on the
31 October or later, need
not travel all the way to
Croydon this year to have
their visa renewed as the
Home Office are coming to
you.
All you need to do for the
present is to bring your
passport into Student
Services, preferably by
Friday 18th October but no
later than Wednesday 23rd
October, and register your
details with Lesley
Gillingham, the Welfare
Adviser, who in turn will
register your details with
the Home Office before the
expiry date in your
passport.
The Home Office will be
sending three staff
members to Imperial
College on Monday 25th
and Tuesday 26th
November to renew visas
on the spot. The whole
process will take 15
minutes; considerably
better than seven hours in
Croydon. It also means that
at no time will you have to
give up your passport,
which is a considerable
improvement as there is no
possibility of documents or
your passport being mislaid
or lost in the post.
This is the first time the
Home Office have come to
Imperial with their
extension scheme. The
more students who use the
A
scheme the greater the
likelihood of the scheme
being repeated next year,
and any student who has
wasted a whole day in
Croydon will agree that it's
a lot more convenient than
any previous situation.
Remember, as long as your
details are registered with
Lesley before the expiry
date in your passport, you
can use the scheme. Check
your visa carefully as any
student whose visa has
already expired and has not
already registered their
claim will have to make the
trip to Croydon.
Welfare Adviser on the move
Lesley Gillingham, the
Welfare Adviser, will be
'setting up shop' outside
Student Services Office
now, in the coming weeks.
She will be visiting
College Houses or Head
Tenancies on the following
dates:
Monday 21st Oct 7-9pm
Lexham Gardens, Flat 4,
79/81
Thursday 25 Oct 7-9pm,
Bernard Sunley House, The
Office, House 42
Monday 28 Oct 7-9pm
Montpelier Hall, The Office
Besides being on hand to
give advice, Lesley will also
have samples of all leaflets
and information sheets
available from Student
Services.
FELIX Friday 18 October 5
