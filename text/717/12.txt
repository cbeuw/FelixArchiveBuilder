'We can lie in bed and rub pound notes all
over each other.
A hundred and fifty thousand of them/
Few people today will
remember Vivian and Keith
Nicholson, still less the
industrial home of
Castleford. When
Nicholson nagged his wife
for nine numbers to fill in
his pools coupon, he
expected to strike blank,
like the time before. Like
the time before that. Come
Saturday afternoon,
however, Keith and 'Goldie'
Nicholson had won
£152,319 and their motto
for the future: to Spend,
Spend, Spend.
Money is not the whole
second. Jack Rosenthal's
adaptation of Vivian
Nicholson's own
autobiography reveals a
great deal more about her
background than the
numerous press reports
which logged and dogged
her private life. First
presented for television
some five years ago, the
Half Moon Theatre has
created a boisterous, new
musical production by Clair
Luckham and Chris Bond.
The production's success
relies upon perfect balance.
Vivian's vulgar tradgedy of
a determined search for
physical love and material
Bloody Funny.
Nigel Atkinson has a few belly laughs.
Sue Ingelton can best be
described as an Australian
Pamela Stephenson in
approach though she lacks
the true cutting edge.
Unfortunately Ms Ingelton
does not see her show as
comedy, Which it
occasionaly is, but as
political theatre which it
most certainly isn't. She
portrays a string of
characters, of which Bill
Rawlings, the pregnant
man, has received most
press coverage. This
character begins the show
but Sue's voice is too
highly pitched to be
genuinely antagonistic
towards the audience,
especially when she tackles
them individualy in the
foyer before the
performance. Much more
amusing is Gemma
Hatchback who lives in a
complete haze and spouts
a whole string of trendy
causes with total sincerity
yet complete lack of
understanding. This
character is genuinely
thought provoking and gets
the best one-liners in the
show.
As a male the most
disturbing manifestation of
the evening was the
overwelming preoccupation
with the menstrual cycle.
While red patches on a
white dress and the odd
good line were greeted with
universal applause the
technical stuff went right
over my head.
Sue Ingelton is a good
comfort alongside the
vicious abandonment of her
past, is repeatedly set
against light hearted
overviews of everyday life,
(falling in love, developing
breasts, courting in the
back of a V.W.). Neither the
drama nor the running .
musical commentary are
allowed to dominate.
The songs were
excellently arranged and
performed, many of them
parodies of old blues and
r'n'b numbers of the day.
Despite the occaisional
slapstick ad-lib due to lack
of concentration, the entire
cast and crew are to be
applauded on this
successful project.This is
particularly true of Victoria
Hardcastle's vulnerable
performance as 'Goldie'
and Ellen Cairn's excellent
'back-yard' stage design.
performer, she completed
110 mins on stage without
any walk-outs which is an
achievement in itself for a
first night crowd. Once
she's ditched a few of her
weaker characters that
even Dick Emery would
have had qualms about and
lost the urge to say fucking
twenty times in a sentence
her career will surely
blossom. Vive menstrual
humour!
