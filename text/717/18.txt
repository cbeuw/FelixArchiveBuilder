So listen out for rhyming
slang, but beware! Writers
of 'Minder' and Eastenders'
sometimes seem to contrive
words such as:
Kettle (and Hob)—(fob)—
Watch
A r i s t o t l e — B o t t l e ( a n d
glass)—Arse!
If you know of any
interesting ones or can
make up some IC—speak
(an apt rhyming slang for a
College personality, event,
department etc) please
send them in. Due to a
cock-up on my behalf with
dates, last weeks
competition deadline has
been extended by a week,
and next issue will see the
best entries for the poems,
songs and Limericks.
We continue our series with
Rhyming slang, which is
essentially cockney
(strictly, born with in the
sound of Bow Bells) but is
now used in a much wider
social context. The
'London' dialect is rich with
slang words and
phrases—boozer, geezer,
'knock it on the head',
'You've got more front than
Selfridges' etc-that no
matter how long you study
here, you're bound to pick
up a couple. Here is a
glossary of the most
popular rhyming slang
you'll meet, and even
Londoners will be surprised
by some of them the most
popular ones are usually
found in their abbreviated
form.
Barnet (Fair), Hair.
China (plate), Mate.
Tod (Sloane), Alone.
Elephants (trunk), Drunk.
Bristols (City) Titty.
Boat (race), face
Jimmie (Riddle), Piddle
Ginger (beer) Queer
Hampton (Wick) Prick.
Iron (hoof), Pouf
Loaf (of Bread), Head.
Rabbit (and Pork), Talk.
Dickety (Uncle Dick), Sick.
Some look strange when
written, but you must
remember the
pronunciation, eg 'Brassic'
comes from Boracic lint
Skint. Also Charing
Cross—Horse become
'Cherrin' Kraws'—"Aws'.
Cockneys feel strongly
about their language, and
are often criticised for
trying to isolate themselves,
but it is a part of their
heritage. The term 'Brass
Tacks' (facts) has become
assimilated into the English
language and you will now
hear it in the House of
Commons although a true
Londoner will now say 'Tin
Tacks'. Some, eg Mothers
Ruin—Gin are phonetically
unsound and in fact this
one is now popularly
replaced by Vera Lynn.
Others you will commonly
come across in London are:
Gold Watch—Scotch
Whistle and Flute—Suit
Daisy roots—Boots
Plates of Meat—Feet
Adam and Eve—Believe
Lady Godiva—Fiver(£5)
Rosy Lea—Tea
Pony and Trap—Crap
Mince-pies—Eyes
Currant bun—Sun
Jack Jones—Alone
