Does he really 'think' that
this attack on my sincerity
is sufficient to create doubt
about the opinions I
expresss? Are the evidence,
assumptions and logic of
the views I put somehow
analysed or questioned by
this clumsy attempt at
character assasination?
Mr Jones' insult, like all
the insults thrown at me,
and at women at IC, insult
the minds and intelligence
of those throwing them. I
genuinely believe Mr Jones
is capable of doing better,
as I am sure, are those who
support his cause. I change
his advice into a challenge.
I challenge anyone to
debate with me in public, at
IC, the issues I have raised.
I do not feel obligated to
defend my own sincerity,
but for those that might
accept Mr Jones' views,
without taking his own
advice, here is my defence.
Hypocrisy should not be
confused with honesty and
self-criticism. I advise
anyone agreeing with the
charge of hypocrisy to
actually read the article Mr
Jones refers to.
I have repeated
consistently, forcefully and
at some personal expense
my opinons about 'human
rights, nuclear warfare and
sexism' while at this
college.
The Union recognised
my contribution to its
social and intellectual life
by awarding me with social
colours (1983-84).
If this dedication and
enthusiasm over three
years at the college do not
suffice to persuade Mr
Jones and others that I
believe in what I do and
say, then they have no care
for the truth. I believe my
actions and words have not
shamed, are not
hypocritical, and indeed
have been an asset to my
college and Union.
I Ask Mr Jones to
withdraw his pathetic
accusations of hypocrisy
and insincerity, and that he
apologise.
Yours sincerely
Michael P Newman

Monopoly Rag
I promised John Ingham I'd
promote Monopoly Rag so
here goes. Monopoly Rag
is an excellent way of
raising money for charity
and having a good time. It
involves running around
London following clues and
collecting treasure.
MENCAP get all the
money. Make sure you turn
up at the C C U Offices at
9am on Saturday morning.
