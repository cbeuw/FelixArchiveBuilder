Bars Boycott Success
Dear Hugh,
lr, the light of the bars
boycott and your interview
with Rob Northey in last
week's FELIX, I would like
to set the record straight
on a few points.
As far as the boycott is
concerned, a number of
students were, during last
week, a little concerned
about the reasons behind
it, so here I will try to
explain them. Firstly, it
should be noted that the
regular, bar-by-bar,
monthly breakdown of the
Bar Trading Account
presented to the Bar
Committee, has not
appeared since last year,
there was an increase by
some twenty five per cent
of the staffing and
administration costs. Mr
Northey explained half of
this as being an
apportioning of
administration costs from
the Refectories. When
pressed by Carl Burgess
and me, he refused to give
a breakdown of these
costs. Finally, there were
the resignations of the
Union Bar staff. Having
worked an eighteen hour
shift the day and night
before, they were told
during Fresher's Fair that
they had not run the bar
very well, despite near
record takings. With over
eighteen months' more
experience of running the
Union Bar than Rob
Northey, they felt
compelled to resign—who
wouldn't? This left
inexperienced bar staff
running the Union Bar
during the busiest week of
the year. After these three
occurrences, plus other
lesser issues, the
sabbaticals and the
students members of the
Bar Committee had lost
confidence in the Bars'
management. This can best
be resolved by Union
Control of the Union Bar,
because that makes the bar
management answerable to
most of the customers.
The above is not an
attack on Rob Northey, but
rather on his management
style—whether decided by
him or otherwise. However,
I would like to take issue
with a couple of his
comments in last week's
FELIX. He stated:' All the
improvements have gone
through the Bar Committee
and the Bar Committee
Chairman, like all major
policy decisions'. Reducing
the level of accountability,
outlined above, was not
discussed. Changing the
method of payment of
casual staff, with its
detrimental effect on
service, first came to me
from one of the casuals. In
addition, the price of
reductions he talked about
were due to the increases,
until I put a sheet of
calculations in front of him
and told him to reduce the
prices of Carlsberg,
Forster, XXXX, Strongbow
and Dry Blackthorn.
Finally, I would like to
come to the boycott itself. I
was delighted by the level
of support that we received
from three areas: the
students who chose not to
drink, or at least drank
elsewhere for a week; John
Fecamp and ASTMS for
their solidarity, and the
managers of the Merrie-go-
Downe, the Norfolk, and
the Queen's Arms
(Chelsea), for their near
instanteous special offers
on prices, which enabled
students to drink not too
expensively elsewhere.
Yours sincerely
Dave Kingston.
reduced to the several lines
submitted last week.
Certainly this offer of open
public debate does not
originate from someone
who is 'shamefaced about
the matters'.
Secondly, Mr Newman is
wrong about the FCS
posters we displayed at
Freshers Fair. They do
portray the feeling of
Conseratives in Consoc
and Conservatives in
general. We do believe the
Greenham Common
Women are 'misguided', we
do object to the continued
presence of USSR armed
forces in Poland and the
Eastern Bloc (as do the
patriots of those countries)
and we do believe that
Arthur Scargill is an anti-
democrat.
Finally, I denounce the
way in which arrogant Mr
Newman links this society
with the removal of CND
posters. I am glad I did not
see your posters Mr
Newman, they may have
offended me. Incidently if I
knew of the person, or
Con Soc Defend
Contras
Dear Sir,
I object strongly to several
remarks made about the
Conservative Society in last
weeks letters. The letters to
which I refer were both
written by people whose
hard left-wing views cannot
be said to be either
objective or universal.
To describe the
Nicaraguan elections of
1984 as 'democratic', and
one resulting government
as 'popular' is a blatant
distortion of the facts. The
absence of 'official'
conservative observers is
irrelevant in the light of
other Western
observers—for example
those representing USA,
who certainly did not
approve of the sham.
Although I do not
condone the violence of the
Contras I would compare
their idealogical struggle
with that of the patriots of
Afghanistan, and several
Eastern Bloc states.
Mr Hobbis unjustly
accuses us of quibbling on
the issue. I offered to
arrange for a Tory speaker
to defend our stance, with
union, at the time, he
seemed quite happy. I now
take it that he has
conceded this opportunity,
since it seems, his own
argument has been
people, who had removed
these posters, I would
inform Mr Burgess, and
support their removal from
the Union.
Yours faithfully

Get Down Roger
Dear Sir,
We are very sorry to hear
that Second Lt Preece did
not enjoy the Life Sciences
Party, this is primarily a
Freshers party, and the
main aim was to get people
together so that students
from different departments
can get out and meet each
other. The success of the
party rests with the guests
as well as the organisers.
We should like to point
out that:-
1 As a Freshers' event,
entrance to the party was
FREE to all students with
Freshers' week tickets, and
to Life Sci students.
2 A bar extension was
applied for, but one had
already been alocated
the Fresher's fair.
The profits made from
the Life Sci party are to be
used to subsidise other
social events and parties at
which we hope second Lt
Preece will be able to 'let
his hair down' a little more.

Damned bounders!
Dear Sir,
I shall be grateful if you put
the following in the
personal ads column of the
coming issue of FELIX:
'Whosoever did the act of
cowardice of throwing a
carrier-bag full of water on
me, on Tuesday the 8th
October in the gents toilet
on 7th floor of Mech Eng at
14.00 should come forward
and let me know what his
intentions were.'

Dear Editor,
In reply to Mr Fernandex's
letter of last week, I would
like to point out that most
of the spelling mistakes in
a publication of this sort
are probably due to people
submitting illegibly written
articles. This in particular
applies to commonly
written phrases or words eg
signatures.
I am sure that the staff of
FELIX can be absolved
from blame for most of the
mistakes.
Yours faithfully,
John Williams

Newman Rant
Dear Hugh,
Michael Jones' letter, last
week, starts off very well. I
am grateful for his 'sincere'
praise of my article 'Mrs
Thatcher, sex, IC and the
single student'.
He gives some good
advice, repeating what I
have said many times
before, that you should
'consider and analyse very
carefully what Michael
Newman has to say'.
Indeed you should do this
'before coming to any
conclusion' about anyone's
views. This was the very
point my article made, and
I would like to thank Mr
Jones for repeating it for
me.
Sadly Michael Jones fails
to live up to his own
advice. Rather than
criticising my arguments
and points he continues the
tradition of those who have
supported hard-core
pornography at IC, he
attacks me personally. He
ignores my article, digging
up something I wrote
nearly two years ago to
accuse me of hypocrisy.
