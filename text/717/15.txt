ICCND
At the Rally for the Human
Race on Sat October 26
CND will be saying that
Britian can make a
difference—a positive
contribution to ending the
nuclear arms race.
The consistent failure of
the superpowers to
negotiate arms reductions
and the stalled talks in
Geneva highlight the
desperate need for other
countries to take
independent and joint
initiatives. By doing this we
can put pressure on the
United State and the Soveit
Union to negotiate
permanent and effective
arms reductions leading to
the dismantling of other
nuclear arsenals and thus
increasing world security.
Britain, as a nuclear
weapons state, is ideally
placed to take such an
independent initiative. It
will make us more secure
and allow us to join with
countries like New Zealand
to provide a rallying point
of those who feel
threatened by the
proliferation of nuclear
weapons and nuclear
weapon states.
This demonstration at the
begining of the UN
International Year of Peace
will show the world what a
positive and vital
contribution we could make
to the disarmament
process. In contrast,
succesive British
governments have not
taken part in any
disarmament talks and have
DRAMSOC

the reviews they received.
Unity—This production of
Unity suceeded...21 year
old Unity has a personality
fractured by incest..all of
the acting is confident and
appropriate, the direction
intelligent..it was well
attended and enjoyed.
(Festival City Radio).
Funeral Games This is Joe
Orton at his wackest
best.Jhis production is
rather good and the
characters are all put over
well., good special effects
which have you jumping
out of your seat. (Festival
City Radio).

a dismal voting record at
the United Nations on
peace and disarmament
issues.
The Rally for the Human
race will demonstrate the
dangers fo the nuclear
arms race and Britain's
contribution to it—the
planned contraction at
huge cost of Trident
submarines with their
massive firepower and our
willingness to host US
Cruise missiles.
Today nuclear Britain is a
pawn in the super power
conflict.
Tomorrow, nuclear free and
independent Britain could
begin to work with friends
and allies throughout the
world for peace and
genuine security.
ICCND, together witht
the West London
Chaplaincy Peace Group,
will be present at this
demo. We'll be meeting at
10.30am on the Albert Hall
steps in Prince Consort
Road, and we want as
many people along as
possible. Let's have a
wonderful turn-out to get
the year off to a good start!

WAR GAMES
As a club, wargames aim to
provide student with the
opportunity to get together
and participate in a wide
variety of games. They vary
from the typical board war
games (and not so typical)
of many levels of
complexity (novice to
master) concerning all
periods of history (ancient
to the far future), to a wide
selection of r6le playing
games (such as D&D,
Runequest, Bushido, etc).
The Club itself possess a
large range of games (incl
Go) So why not come
along on Sundays or
Wednesdays at 1.00pm to
the Senior Common Room
(first floor Union Building)
and discover what we've
got to offer.
Membership is only £1.50
and this includes a
discount of 10% to 15% on
games at selected shops.
fC TENNIS CLUB
The tennis club ladder is
now up on the noticeboard
in the sports centre. The
rules of the ladder are also
on the board. If you are not
a member of the club and
would like to join contact
Steve Cain through Chem
Eng 3 letter racks or come
along to the club practise
every Wednesday afternoon
from 1.00pm at the
Linstead Tennis courts.
ORCHESTRA
A Fresh start..but not a new
beginning
Later this term Imperial
College Symphony
Orchestra will be staging
their first concert of the
year after only ten
rehearsals and with about
one third of their number
performing with the
orchestra for the first time;
should you be there to hear
it?
You may think that
'classical music' is not to
your taste but its worth
giving yourself the chance
to find out. Music is so
much more exciting heard
live, as a neighbour of mine
discovered when at the age
of 21, after years of seeking
the best quality
reproduction from 'pop-
records', he went to hear a
performane at the Festival
Hall of Beethoven's Fifth
Symphony. Then went back
again and again.
So don't miss your
chance. This term's concert
will be Tchaikovsky's
'Romeo and Juliet'
overture, Vaughan-Williams'
'The Lark Ascending', and
Rachmanivov's 'Symophony
no 2'. It's going to be a
sizzler so look out for the
posters and book it in your
diary—if you don't go,
you'll regret it.
