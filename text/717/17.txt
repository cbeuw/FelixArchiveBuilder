•Chevalier Brothers
If you missed the
Chevalier Brothers at

again, for that matter!),
then you can catch them at
Ronnie Scott's on Sunday.
Starting at 8pm, it's £5 in
advance and £6 on the
door. Ronnie Scott's is in
Frith Street, W1. Ring 01-
439 0747.
•Cinema
Something that could be
quite interesting to see is
Ron Peck's 'What Can I Do
With A Male Nude?'(The
mind boggles!). There's a
full supporting bill and it
runs from today until the
26th October at the
Everyman Cinema,
opposite Hampstead Tube.
Telephone 01-435 1525 for
details.
•Cabaret
Chris Eymard and Robert
Llewellyn take their show
to the Crown and Castle
Caberet on Saturday.
Entitled Blah!, it sends up
male behaviour by
portraying everything from
trendy, hypocritical liberals
through to chauvinistic
dickheads. A must for all
I.C. females who are sick of
the average male student
around here!

complexity, religious
