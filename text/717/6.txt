Currently, there is a subversive campaign
whose aim it to destroy the moral fabric
of society by the destruction of its
building block, the family. The
perpetrator is inflicting boredom, and
frustration on the housewife,
consequently, acts of adultery with the
milkman are merely syptomatic of this
problem; the subject that I am refering to
is, of course the Jimmy Young
Programme.
The music is of such a
stereotyped nature that it
can be categorised into two
groups: the standards and
'bland best'. The latter
involves taking a song that
has recently been in the
Top Forty and allowing a
pulp-merchant to remove
all feeling and life from it
until it becomes utterly
insipid; hey-presto, the
'plastic, hep cat,
supermarket' mix is
produced. 'Groups' who
spew out such 'music'
would be quite capable of
transforming a Sex Pistol
song into an
indistinguishable 'nice
song'; here is an example:
Lead singer: 'She was a girl
from Birmingham.'
Backing vocals: 'mmmmm,
yes she was: undoubtedly:
Absolutely: No question of
this fact: A we lass from that
midland city in question.'
Lead singer: 'And she's just
had a delicate operation'.
Backing vocals: 'Had her
legs open wide: (The doctor
said, 'Say 'aaahh'); Had a
vacuum cleaner inserted

inside; And the foetus was
sucked out; Oh Boy, what's
life all about? It's a shame,
shoo bop, shoo bop.'
I have to concede that,
when listening to it, I was
unable to compete with this
aural onslaught and
undoubtedly brain death
would have occurred but
for the phone-ins and
write-ins which supplied
the necessary relief.
JY: 'And we have a letter
from Miss P from W11,
'Dear Doctor, my mother
says that if I wear my
sanitory towel into the sea,
water will be absorbed and
an infection is likely to
result', well, what have you
got to say to that, Doc?'
This sort of problem is
very typical of those sent
into the 'resident' doctor,
since for some reason
genital disorders are very
popular amongst his
listeners—do they really
use an everyday umbrella
in the treatment? Other
complaints that occur
frequently are 'maligent
I
in is the piece-de-
resisitance and it is
unsurprising that one M.
Thatcher is a great admirer
of the Jimmy Young show,
since it is the verbal
equivalent of the Da/7y Mail.
If you are unfamiliar with
the programme, JY
conducts an interview with
a spokesman concerning a
recent issue or event;
listeners then phone in with
their comments and a
selected few are aired.
Usually, the first one to be
broadcast is an unsubtley
stereotyped left-wing
sentiment that is designed
to outrate the true blues
who reply, swamping the
show with their view
(notice that I use the
singular since only one
opinion is held by these
people) and it is reiterated
numerous times throughout
the prgramme. A good
example was on VJ day;
First phone caller: / believe
it was morally wrong to

lumps', 'growths' and
'swellings' that disfigure
what I can only imagine are
already putrid faces,
breasts or abdomens. It
strikes me, however, that
these doctor advice
sessions are paradoxical
since the reason that
people write in is because
they are too embarrassed
to consult a doctor who is
usually of the opposite sex,
black or a socialist (they all
are nowadays, those on the
NHS anyway) about what
they consider to be a
'taboo' matter. However,
they are not, it seems,
adverse to having their
disorders divulged to a few
million listeners who put on
sympathetic pretenses to
veil their morbid fascination
and enjoyment that they
have derived from other
people's 'sordid nasties'.
Other write-ins are
similar in style, the topics
covered being food,
holidays and other
domestic and consumer
matters; these tend to
demonstrate people's
selfishness and small-
mindedness.
The current-affair phone-
such a horrific manner').
Second phone caller: 7
believe that we should have
dropped more bombs on the
rest of Japan and really
shown them 'what for'.
Third phone caller: '/ was
absoultely outraged by your
first caller, I say death to
Japan'.
Fourth phone caller: ' My
budgie died at the same
time that the news of Pearl
Harbour was annouced on
the wireless, so I think that
all Japanese males ought
to be castrated. It really
outrages me to hear these
people who can sympathise
with the deaths of
thousands of fellow human
beings'.
An appreciation of the
gross crassitude of people
will be obtained by
sampling this. So if you
ever tune in-beware; it will
not be surprising if you feel
compelled afterward to
leave college in order to
write the ultimate
philosophical text to
enlighten the populus-you
have been warned.
