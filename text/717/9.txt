Rent too high?
Landlord getting you down?
Warden getting up your nose?
Here's the answer-
No-one can ignore the
problems encountered by
many young people when
faced with finding a place
to live. For some its asking
their dear old dad to
guarantee a mortgage,
other struggle to live
comfortably when half of
their student grant is spent
on rent. But for those who
are unemployed, and
worse—single, the worries
are daunting. Will they be
given a council house? Will
the DHSS pay all their
rent? Will they need to take
help from an independent
organisation like
SHELTER? For all these
people, but particularly the
third group, there is a
realistic alternative, a way
out of the embarrassment
which lies on the edge of
the law—Squatting.
As defined, squatting is
not against the law. Once a
person is inside a property
he is doing nothing
criminal. The only way of
removing him/her is
through the civil courts, by
applying for a repossession
order. This can be a
lengthy process, especially
when proceedings are
brought by a Labour
controlled council. For
political reasons, they do
not condone squatting, but
they do make the practice
relatively easy. Hence their
housing departments can
take six months or more to
clear cases through the
courts. This process takes
far less time if the property
is occupied by persons
other than the squatters, or
if authorised people are
about to more in.
So far, everything looks
fine—a nice home, free of
charge or rent for six
months or more. But from
now on, the picture gets
less exciting (or more so if
you enjoy living an
uncertain, dangerous life).
If you think squatting is for
you, then your first step
must be to read about it.
Unearth any legal
loopholes you may need,
and talk to the experts. The
Citizen's Advice Bureau
can be very helpful, and
will put you in touch with
squatter's organisations in
your area. These
organisations are often run
by people who have been
squatting in the area for
many years. They will know
the answers to any relevant
questions, and will offer
unequaled advice.
The next step is to find a
squat. Don't bother looking
for one in Kensington or
Belgravia. Even if you did
find an empty building. You
will be out of it very soon
(remember the Hamlet
Gardens faisco). Your place
must be unoccupied and
'unfit for habitation', a
bureaucratic term that
often means no more than
'has a broken window' or
'needs central heating'. It
must be council property,
preferably on a housing
estate. This will ensure that
you are not alone and will
not be rated as a special
case in court. It must be in
a Labour controlled
borough. If your intended
squat satisfies all of these
conditions then you can
look forward to many
months of Free
Living—once you're in.
breaking the lock. If the
police do come around
then they will not believe
your story about walking in
through the back door if
the front door lock looks as
if it's been knocked out by
a sledge hammer.
So, now you're looked at
four places and found one
in reasonable order. It
might need a lick of paint,
but the plumbing works
and it is quite clean. The
first thing to do is put your
own lock on the door. This
action proclaims that you
are in residence, and intend
to live there. Do not move
in everything in right away,
but spend at least a day
there to make sure you
have the right place. Then
make the place look lived
in—put up curtains if you
have them and put all your
belonging in front facing
rooms. If the windows are
boarded up, now is the
time to take the boards
down - as quickly as
possible. During the first
week you must be very
careful. Do not let any
strangers into the squat,
and treat anyone who looks
official with confidence.
You have made this
residence your home and
no one can force you to
leave except the courts.

Getting into a squat is
not a problem. Moving in to
it is, so it is wise to
investigate a number of
places before you decide
on the right one.
Remember that unless you
walk in through an
open/unlocked door, then
you are technically
'breaking and entering', so
to avoid breaking the law,
keep your eyes peeled for
open doors. If you wish to
break the law then do it
discreetly. Your future
neighbours may not object
to squatters, but they won't
take kindly to the sound of
hammering and splintering
wood at 4-o-clock in the
morning. Try to open a
window or door without
Furniture should be easv
to get hold of, other
residents often throw out
items in reasonable
condition. Local street
markets are also a cheap
source of second-hand
useable beds, chairs, sofas
etc but remember that a
squat is not a permanent
residence and all contents
will need to be moved
when you go, so don't get
anything unwiedly unless
you can get hold of a van.
A few words about gas,
electricity and telephones.
If you're very lucky, these
will be connected when
you move in but it is rare.
Never try to connect them
yourself unless you are
prepared to be taken to a
criminal court for theft. If
this is yor chosen course of
action then make it
possible to prove that your
intended to pay for all used
services. Deposit sufficent
money, with details of
meter readings etc with a
bank or better still, a
solicitor. The Electricity
and Gas Boards have a
legal obligation to supply
any household with their
services upon request but
the law is vague about
whether a squat is a
household so you might
find them awkward.
After some time, the
council's housing
department will
acknowledge that you are
squatting and will ask you
to move out. This is only a
request and you should not
do so. After more time they
will warn you of court
proceedings. Again, you
are not legally bound to
vacate the premises nor
can they force you out yet.
The next step is a court
summons. Ignoring this will
not help you, but the
outcome of the hearing will
not be to your advantage
anyway, so do not go to
court. Finally, you will
notified of the courts
findings and will be told
that the court baliffs will
evict you forcibly if you are
still in occupation on a
certain date. This means
that a bunch of 'heavies'
will visit you on that date,
they will break down the
door if necessary, dump all
your belongings on the
street, and ensure that you
cannot get back in. Now,
you have our original
problem back—you are
homeless. So go out and
find another squat!
Finally, some advice on
anonimity. The only time
you must reveal your real
name is to the police, or
when under oath, so do not
give your name to Anyone
if it can be avoided. The
civil court will then refer to
you as 'persons unknown'.
If you must give a name
(eg to the Electricity
Board), use an alias, this is
not an offence!
Squatting is hard work,
but it can be fun—you will
meet people from all walks
of life, and you will learn
much that is normally
ignored or taken for
granted. You will also save
money.Don't do it unless
you are committed (or
desperate) and always keep
smiling - it can get
depressing. If you can stay
in the same place for
twelve years, the property
becomes yours (this is the
only 'Squatters right') so
there is something to aim
for.
