Letters FELIX, Friday September 29 1986 2
Concerned
Dear Dave,
As one of the people who signed
the Barclays Bank Anti-Apartheid
leaflet in this year's handbook I am
slightly concerned about a couple
of issues it has raised. Several
people have suggested to me that
officers of the union have abused
their positions of responsibility by
distributing their own propaganda
through union resources.I wonder
whether this insert would have
been allowed if it had not been
espousing a political cause
supported by the President.
I have happily associated my
name with the Anti-Apartheid
campaign as I believe that the time
when our elected representatives
should have unequivocally done
the same is long past. To those who
say that Barclays are an innocent
bystander in the Apartheid regime
I would reply that even if there were
some truth in this it is far less
unfortunate than the mounting
death toll in the black townships.
As the British government has
resolutely resisted proper sanctions
in its attempts to protect
investments in South Africa it is
becoming more and more
necessary for independent groups
to make whatever gestures they can
to protect our long term standing
with the Southern African nations.
Unfortunately I C Union has no
clear policy on the South African
issue. In this case it is inevitable
that commercial pressures on such
enterprises as the handbook will
take priority in deciding what
advertising to carry. However
purely commercial criteria would
have suggested that the drought
victims in northern Africa should
have been left to die - to their credit
millions of people decided these
were not the only criteria and
flocked to support the 'Band Aid'
appeals. It is time Imperial students
decided where they stand one way
or another on this issue at a Union
meeting so that the decisions are
not delegated to individuals by
default. Similarly, maybe there
should be a clear policy on who is
allowed to send out material via the
freshers mailing.
I do not really believe there
should be any conflict over this
issue but perhaps matters should be
clarified. I wonder what sort offuss
might have arisen had the
Conservative Society asked to be
able to distribute counter-
propaganda in reply to the
Barclay's leaflet. I hope they would
have got a fair hearing. I hope
Executives will avoid getting
confused between their rights as
members of IC Union and their
obligation to impartiality as paid
staff, I belive they have just about
managed so far.
Yours looking concerned as ever

Bigoted
Re-Apps
Dear Dave,
As a resident of Beit Hall I have
just received a copy of "Otto", the
Beit Hall newsletter. I am
disappointed to see the sort of
impression it gives to Freshers. It
contains what purports to be a
timetable of Freshers' Week. If
Freshers take any notice of this at
all they will be stupid if they attend
any of the Freshers' events. I was
also saddened to read a revue of the
Union Bar that was full of dated
cliches. Imperial College Union has
invested, on behalf of its members,
a significant amount of money in
developing the bar, as part of an
effort to make the Union Building
the centre of social life at College.
Everyone involved in this
process expects to meet with a great
deal of difficulty in removing the
stigma attached to "The Union"
amongst returning students.
However the job will be impossible
if their bigoted views are imposed
on Freshers, especially in such a
forceful way by re-apps in an
official newsletter.
If it is not sufficient reason that
the profits of the bar belong to the
Students' Union, then the editors,
from a point of view of accuracy,
should have taken time to walk 50
yards across Beit Quad to find if
there was anything better they
could tell the new residents of Beit
Hall about the Union. May I make
a plea to all Freshers; there are
more than enough people willing to
give you their opinion, but please
reserve judgement until you have
seen for yourself.
Yours sincerely,
Jackie Pierce,
IC Union Deputy President.
Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing to you as I believe
that in your capacity as President
of the Students' Union you may
well be able to be of assistance to
me and my family.
To put you in the picture, my
daughter has been in hospital for
several months and is to return
home shortly to recouperate. Her
illness is in no way infectious but
the doctors believe that she will
need about a year to recover,
before she can return to work.
Initially, I shall be able to stay with
her but after that I wish to make
arrangements for someone to come
to our home every day so that she is
not left entirely alone every day. I
therefore thought it might be
possible that a student would be
willing to come in for a few hours
once or twice a week during the
afternoon. I would point out that
my daughter does not need a nurse
but merely wishes to have
Dep Reps
Defended
Dear Dave,
I feel I must reply to a point
raised by Hugh Stiles in his recent
opinion article (FELIX, Sept 7).
He suggested that CCUs
manipulate the Dep Rep vote on
Council by threatening to cut
departmental society funds, hence
securing a CCU majority on
Council. The idea is totally
unrealistic and slanderous. Dep
Reps are intelligent people with
minds of their own and may vote as
they see fit. Furthermore, if a CCU
did threaten Departmental society
funds, the Dep Rep concerned need
only publicise the fact and untold
unpopularity and damage would
result for the CCU concerned
(especially if ICU were tofindout).
This, coupled with the fact that
most Dep Reps, unfortunately,
don't attend Council, makes
Hugh's idea of a CCU conspiracy
to take over ICU seem laughable.
A chairman of Council must be
impartial. I wouldn't like to think
that there is any bias which will
show through in the coming year.
Finally, I would like to say I
appreciate the work of the Major
Sub Committees (MSCs) and feel
we mustn't always think in terms of
MSC/CCU conflict. I bare Hugh
no malice, I merely wish to clear up
a piece of Anti-CCU story telling.
Yours Sincerely
Duncan Royle
President City and Guilds Union
somebody else present in the flat.
The student would not be expected
to keep her company and would be
free to read or pursue their studies
as they wish.
If you think it would be at all
possible that you could put us in
touch with a student who could
help us out in the way described
above I should be most grateful. I
should add that we live in South
Kensington, near the Gloucester
Road tube and that, if required, we
would be happy to provide you
with references. I can be reached
during the day at the address and
telephone number given above.
With kind regards,
Yours faithfully,
Maria Gani-Senger.
(Editor's note: Anyone interested
should contact Christine Taig in the
Union Office).
Sexist?
Dear Dave,
Again and again I am appalled
by the attitudes of some of the
people I meet, and nothing disturbs
me more than some of the sexist
and racist views I hear from people
who should know better.
If you ask one of these people if
they are racist/sexist their reply is
an alarmed "Of course not". What
they mean is that they are not
consciously discriminatory.
Anybody who has been brought up
with the attitudes around today, I
contend, cannot help but
discriminate against certain
groups. It is this unconscious
discrimination that is the greatest
danger to the multicultural society
that exists in Britain today, not the
ravings of the National Front and
the occasional Tory MP.
What do I mean by unconscious
discrimination? I mean the
assumption that certain jobs are
carried out by a certain sex, that
certain races have certain
characteristics and so on, that we
do without thinking. The exact
nature of these opinions is
unimportant; what is important is
that they exist but we are extremely
reluctant to admit that they do.
What is a society so ridden with
discrimination doing to improve
the situation? Unfortunatly, by its
very nature, it is the minorities that
are discriminated against, and
unless the ruling majority decide to
do something about it, it is the
nature of our society that nothing
does happen. All the media are in
the control of the majority; they are
very slow to change, and, without
any pressure, why should they?
Only the ordinary person can do
anything about it. I support any
idea that makes you think about
discrimination, instead of
reinforcing it. One minor point is
the use of the word 'Chairman'. It,
however slightly, reinforces the
sexual stereotype. 'Chairperson' or
just 'Chair' is better, if only because
it makes you stop and think that
the majority of 'Chairmen' ARE
men. I am concerned about the
number of people who think that
this whole thing is a 'lefty' idea and
rubbish the whole thing. If being
against discrimination is a 'lefty'
idea, then I hope that you are all
'leftys'.
Bringing the issue closer to
home, just because there has never
been a woman in charge of a Major
Subcommittee of IC Union does
not mean there never will, and to
deal tiny blow against discriminat-
ionn myself, I am announcing that
I prefer to be called the 'Chair' of
Publications Board. You can call
me whatever you like; I'll be happy
if you just think about what you are
saying when you say it.
Yours,
Chris Martin,
Chair, Publications Board.
