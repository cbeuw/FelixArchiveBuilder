FELIX, Friday September 29 1986 1 5
CM i h s
The city's skyscrapers hardly
scrape the sky; they poke miserably
above the smog of its inhabitants'
million motor cars with a greasy film
of dirt and grime clinging to their
grey and dull exteriors. But under
this dreary skin lies a city buzzing
with life and vibrancy within the
reach of even the most miserly
student. London is great, and if you
stay at home and study all night long
you are missing the greatest
opportunity youll ever have to see
the marvels of life—and have fun
too! Unfortunately the college you
have come to may give a bad
outward impression. But the college
is you, the students, so there lies the
blame/or the opportunity for a great
time. It is up to you.
This year's sabbaticals, I guess,
want to make sure you are having
ENJOY
YOURSELF
fun. And they have made the first
step: Your building, the students
Union Building, has had a great deal
of time and money spend on it. It's
up to you to use it and I can't say this
for sure, something reasonably
exciting will happen at least once a
week on Thursday, Friday, or
Saturday depending on this and
that, but mainly on whether I can
book a band or something similar.
Anyhow I'll keep you informed.
So for starters—information

AMNESTY
INTERNATIONAL
The Imperial College group of the
human rights organisation Amnesty
International is an adoption group;
in return for a special subscription
of £550 per year it is allocated at all
times its own carefully researched
case on which to work. Each case
involves someone who, without
having used or advocated violence,

Save money, cos I haven't
booked anything. Or use your
newly procured Ents card to sample
events at other colleges in London,
and meet some other bunch of
idiots there.
Week 3
I guess the term-time blues
should be setting in by now. But
forget work on Thursday evening
and pop down to the Union. We've
organised an especially cheap
evening with videos, food, bar
promotions and a fantastic Virgin
band called 'Fruits of Passion' who
have released three 12 inch singles
already and are promoting their
new album which should make
them megastores—um stars, sorry.

Imperial this term -
Week 4
On Thursday in the concert hall
you can see the greatest live band
youH ever have the opportunity to
lay your eyes on and dance yourself
mad to—The Larks. Nuts from all
over the place will be clamouring at
the doors to get in and with the
reviews they have been getting
don't be surprised if half the music
journalists in town aren't knocking
around amongst the common folk
too. A night of zany goings on which
will keep you away from work, your
bed and the floor for a little while
longer. Bar promotions et al.

prisoners conform to this

Week 5
The witching day is Friday.
The venue is very new.
Don't be frightened by the
Godsend.
Halloween sets the scene
Venture down to the Lounge on
Friday 31 to see the best all girl band
since the 'The Shangrilas'. 'His
latest Flame ' are from the north of
the border and have come down to
bonnie London for a only a couple
of dates.
What else to do? Well, the ICA in
the Mall is great for all sorts of
modern art from punk to poetry.
The club scene stinks of funk at the
moment and seems to be full of very
shallow superficial people but thats
only my opinion, and probably
applies to me too. Scala cinema late-
cases have involved prisoners, now
released, from Sri Lanka, Zaire,
Benin, Uruguay and South Africa.
The prisoner adopted at present
is Ivan Yakovlevich Starovoit of the
USSR, who was sentenced with
four others to five years'
imprisonment with hard labour for
practising his religion as a Jehovah's
Witness in an unregistered
congregation. Denial of permission
to register and official interference
in the conduction of services
following registration leaves many
religious groups in the USSR no
alternative but to disregard the legal
requirement of registration. Four
years after his arrest (which took
place in summer 1982) Starovoit will
qualify for early release if, like most
Jehovah's Witnesses, he has
behaved well in prison. You can
help Starovoit by politely asking the
Department of Internal Affairs of
the Donetsk region to order his
early release on the grounds of good
behaviour.
Advice on writing to foreign
governments
1 Never be rude or offensive.
2 Never advance any political or
religious views. Remember that you
are writing purely on humanitarian
grounds.
nighters in Kings Cross are great
fun. Impress your loved one by
taking them to the Hilton Rooftop
restaurant for Sunday brunch but
take out a third mortage! The
Rhythm Room in Swiss Cottage is a
cheap place to see good Latin and
jazz bands in a pub atmosphere. All
the museums and art galleries in
London have something doing
that's well worth seeing. Or take a
walk by the river in Richmond or
through the myriads of parks. Well,
that should keep you going for a few
weeks. Have fun, don't do too much
work and see you in November! So

'When the first two hundred letters came the guards gave me back my
clothes. Then the next two hundred letters came and the prison director
came to see me. When the next pile of letters arrived the director got in
touch with his superior. The letters kept coming and coming: three
thousand of them. The President was informed. The letters kept arriving
and the President called the prison and told them to let me go.
After I was released the President called me to his office for a man-to-
man talk. He said: 'How is it that a trade union leader like you has so
many friends all over the world?' He showed me an enormous box of
letters he had received and when we parted he gave them to me. I still
have them.'
