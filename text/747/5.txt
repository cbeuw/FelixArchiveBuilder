Merger Moves
In May FELIX revealedthat discussions were underway
about a merger with St Marys Medical School. Imperial
has been the possible subject of mergers before. But
this time it looks as if there is a real chance of students
entering the College this year witnessing the greatest
change in its history for over 70 years.
A New Constituent
College for IC?
' So what is St Marys actually like,
and how do they view a merger with
Imperial College? In basic factual
terms St Marys is a college of
approximately 500 students who are
all taking a 5 year course in
Medicine. It is situated in Praed
Street, fairly near to Edgeware Road
tube station. Students are divided
roughlyfifty-fiftybetween male and
female, and about half find
accommodation in the School's own
hall of residence. The School was
founded in 1854 andfinallybecame
separate from St Mary's Hospital
under the 1948 National Health
Service Act. During its long and
distinguished history it has seen
considerable changes in its
buildings which are continuing
today with the construction of a new
wing, and in 1928 Sir Alexander
Fleming discovered pencillin there.
Day to day administration is in
the hands of Secretary Keith
Lockyer who is very much the
equivalent of the IC College
Secretary John Smith. A jovial Mr
Lockyer interrupted a busy schedule
to give me a guided tour of some of
the school's facilities. He is
extremely enthusiastic about the
possibilities of academic links and
also about the benefits for students.
He explained the background to the
merger proposals over a mug of
milk and a biscuit. In 1969 a
document called the Todd Report
recommended that the London
Medical Schools would benefit from
links with multi-disciplinary
colleges. The Todd proposals
themselves have been abandoned
but the problems recognised by that
report are still relevant and were
very much in the mind of Prof Peter
Richards, the Dean of St Mary's
when he approached the Rector of
IC. It is not insignificant that Prof
Ash has come from UCL, which is
linked to UCH medical school, and
it is believed that the experience of
this has led the Rector to view a
merger as a possibility.
A working party has been set up
to produce detailed proposals for a
merger and is due to report by next
summer. There are four sub-groups
with detailed briefs to investigate,
among other things, Student Unions
and Services. If a merger is to take
place it will have to occur at the
beginning of a financial year and
because an act of parliament will be
required to disolve St Mary's and
incorporate it into IC the likely
target date is 1st August 1988.
It is impossible to draw accurate
parallels at this stage, but the
current proposals seem to envisage
St Marys becoming essentially a
fourth constituent college. The
department at Imperial to be most
affected by a merger would be Life
Sciences. Indeed a merger has been
described as a way of enlarging Life
Sci while circumventing the
problems of space and money.
From St Marys' point of view they
believe a large institution such as
Imperial with a similar standing to
themselves in its respective
disciplines will enable them to
exploit their research better.
Potential multi-disciplinary fields
include the developement of
surgical technnology and
biochemical technology. There are
unlikely to be vast changes to
undergraduate courses at first.
On the non-academic side a
merger could cause some more
interesting changes. The size of St
Marys means that it cannot afford
to run Student Services on the scale
of IC and its Union does not have
any sabbatical officers. I spoke to Jo
Osborne (Treasurer) and Ruth
Charlton (Assisant Social Secretary)
in the Union Office who were both
cautiously optimistic but said they
had not yet seen any proposals on
which they could comment. They
described the course they follow and
the way it affects student life. The
in to IC or indeed whether they will
want to is a question which is sure to
see considerable discussion. It is
interesting to note that like most
Medical Schools, St Mary's are not
affiliated to the NUS; they are
however members of ULU and the
National Student Services
Organisation.
The proximity of St Mary's
means it would be quite feasible for
IC students to live in St Mary's
Wilson House residences and
medical students to live here. The
split location is similar in some ways
first two years follow fairly normal
university terms after which there
are three years clinical training
which can often take students to
other hospitals such as the Central
Middlesex or the Royal Berkshire
and involves a heavy workload. This
.means that union events which
culminate with the May Ball and
Rag Week at the beginning of
March are mostly supported by first
and second years. St Marys are
particularly proud of their Rugby
club which has a formidable
reputation and has produced stars
such as J P R Williams and Kevin
Sims. How St Mary's Union will fit
to Southampton University Medical
School. Keith Lockyer seemed
impressed by IC Student Services
and Welfare facilities but was keen
to emphasise that St Mary's don't
expect to generate a heavy net
burden. The first meeting of the
Student and Services Sub-group is
expected to be in the next few weeks
and proposals will hopefully
become clearer then. The timetable
and the enthusiasm shown by the
academics will mean that the
student unions could have a
substantial task on their hands in
the very near future.
