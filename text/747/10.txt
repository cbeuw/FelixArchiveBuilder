FELIX, Friday September 29 1986 10
L I F E IN T H E F A S T L A N E !
It's difficult to write this without
repeating what I've said before in
the Handbook or telling non-
Freshers what they already know.
However, bear with me and 1
1
1 do
my best.
Firstly, hello to all new students
and welcome back to all 2nd, 3rd,
4th, ...nth years. If your summer
was half as good as mine youll be
feeling tired, confused and totally
unprepared for the year of hard
work ahead of you. Even if that's not
the case, there's the best Freshers'
Week ever to finish you off
completely.
Get down to the Union Building
tonight for an evening of jive, skiffle
and blues; allow your Constituent
College Union to entertain you in
inimitable style(?), Tuesday to
Thursday; laugh yourself silly at
Wednesday's comedy night; and
on Friday, back to the Union for the
amazing Freshers' Carnival; pop,
reggae and rock bands (plus
Norman and the Nutburgers, who
defy description!), films, discos, and
a late bar...see you there. As if all
that wasn't enough, there'll be
events in your Department and Hall
of Residence...and the hyperactive
maniacs amongst you will be up at
the crack of dawn on Saturday to
tiddley-wink down Oxford Street in
aid of rag charities—one of Imperial
College's more endearing
traditions.
Have fun this week and whatever
you do don't miss the Freshers' Fair
tomorrow afternoon. This is your
chance to talk to the people
organising various clubs and
.activities and to decide which of
them appeal to you. It is
indispensible if you intend to get
involved in anything other than your
degree course.
Lectures? I believe they begin on
Wednesday.
And now for the last bit of
preaching...while you're in the
Union Building collecting your
Union Cards, have a look
around—especially at the new-look
snack bar on the ground floor. Old-
timers amongst you may notice a bit
of a change...'Norman's (he of the
Nutburgers—this is a man of many
talents) will now be open, with food
and a bar, at lunchtimes and in the
evenings. Don't forget that when
you eat and drink in the Union, not
only do you pay very low prices but
also any profits go back into the
Union to provide facilities for
you...OK end of sermon.
This summer has certainly been
eventful. It seems we're lucky to
have a full complement of sabbatical
officers—What with Dave Colley
nearly being lost at sea and Jackie
Peirce nearly eloping—which leads
me to the fun bit. Congratulations
to Jackie and Hugh (although I'm
still stunned by your recklessness!)
Just don't let it interfere with your
uork...and if anyone wants to bring
me flowers and champagne (no
strings attached of course) you
know where the office is.

Today is the first day of term (not
news!). Unfortunately at this late
stage there are still many students
who have not managed to arrange
any suitable accommodation (also
not news) but (good news) if that
includes you, there is no need to
despair. Crash Pad that all time
favourite is back for yet another
long run. Now playing in the Union
Upper Lounge.
Crash Pad is free, is open every
night from 9pm until 9.30am, and is
available to any homeless students
who book in for it, before 6pm, in
the Union Office. All you need is a
sleeping bag, or equivalant, and a
sense of humour. Crash Pad will
remain in operation as long as is
needed.
For any women students who
won't be at the Freshers' Reception
today, here's a reminder that I.C.
Union has a policy to issue free, to
any female student who wants one,
a personal rape alarm. These are
pocket-sized, high-pitched shrill
alarms which can be collected from
the Deputy President, in the Union
Office, on production of a Union
Card. Members of staff may
purchase them at cost price (about
£1.50).
Also self-defence courses will be
run by the Police during the year,
with thefirstone hopefully running
for 4 weeks on Thursday evenings,
from October 16th. Any women
wishing to attend this type of course
Hello all you people.
I have just arrived back from my
holiday at sea in a 36 foot yacht,
most of which was spent bouncing
about in a force 8 gale gusting 10.
Now I am in the midst of organised
chaos. The new term is upon us and
the time has arrived to answer the
same questions 5 thousand times
and still stay smiling. The people
have been saving up problems all
over the summer and will with the
please sign up in the Union Office.
They are limited to 20 places but
more courses will be run according
to demand.
This isn't meant to sound like
scare-mongering, but there is a
need for women to be prepared
against assault.

Imperial College Charity Rag will be
staging the very popular annual
event of Tiddleywinks down Oxford
Street on Saturday October 4. It's
an event not to be missed and there
are major prizes for the 3 top
collectors. Meet at your CCU office
at 9.00am to collect your badges
and cans, and look out for posters
throughout the week.
Our second major collection will
be happening on Saturday October
18th, when we will be playing human
monopoly. This is basically a
treasure hunt thoughout London
with your travelcard paid for by us.
Clues! will need to be solved, and a
prize of an Olympus camera will be
presented to whoever wins. In the
evening of Monopoly, there is also a
besttimingpossible choose now to
smack us with them.
Still I am the optimist, relishing
the prospect of the new term after
the lee of the summer and looking
forward to meeting most if not all of
my old friends and thefirstyears.
The first Question to answer will
be about Parking Permits. Obtain
an application form from me on
Monday September 29 and hand
the completed form in by 4.00pm
Friday 3 October.
At the weekend a committee
shall sit to determine the most
deserving cases, so if you fail in your
application then an appeals form
can be completed in the week
following. Please don't hassle Kathy
for forms, just take one and put the
completed form back in the tray
provided.
A leaflet explaining the Houses of
residence policy for insurance will
be circulated to all residents, if you
don't get one, please come and see
me in the office.
After that, all that is left for me to
say is—be careful of your property
and anybody else's and enjoy your
year here. If you can, play a sport or
join a recreational or social
club—and get more out of your
stay here than just a degree. If there
are any problems, than come and
see us, that's what we're here for.

disco/concert being staged with Tri-
60 and our very pwn 'Blue Blue Ice'
performing (previously known as
Duo) at the Hammersmith Town
Hall. Tickets are 50p to IC Students
and there's a bar at the hall.
Watch out for Rag week coming
soon too, starting on November
12th. I hope you have fun
participating in these events, and
the money raised goes to a worthy
cause.
