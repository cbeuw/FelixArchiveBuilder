Biochemistry
Flooded
The Biochemistry building was
flooded on the night of 31st July.
The water was discovered in the
boiler room just after 10.00pm, but
the Chelsea Fire Brigade was not
called until 11.00pm, after
maintenance engineers had tried to
pump out the building with their
own pumps.
The clear up operation lasted
most of the night while technicians
and firemen attempted to seal the
valves in the boiler room.
The flood is estimated to have
caused between £7,000 and £10,000
worth of damage.

More Funding
For Higher
Education
Education Secretary Kenneth Baker
announced an increase of £54m in
funds for polytechnics and colleges
of higher education in 1987/8 which
brings total funding in the tertiary
sector to £715m. This figure has
exceeded most expectations and
represents an 8
% increase. Of the
£54m, £39m will be added directly to
the total available for the public
sector of higher education and£ 15m
will be 'applied selectively' in areas
such as science & technology.
The surprise announcement
comes after the National Advisory
Body had proposed drastic
reductions in the number of
students admitted to colleges and
polytechnics, anticipating that cuts
would be essential.
Mr Baker stressed his
commitment to maintain access to
higher education and said that the
money that he was making available
should allow for expansion at
institutes of further education.
A climbing wall has been installed in a corridor offofthe JCR Walkway over
Summer. Anybody is welcome to come and try it out.
NUS Pledge
The London Regional Secretary of
the National Union of Students Mr
Vaughen West has pledged to get
Imperial College Union into the
NUS by the end of the year. Mr
West announced this during a ULU
training week for sabbatical officers
at Wye College at the end of July.
The 'pledge' follows the success
NUS had in persuading Kings
College (KQC) to affiliate.
Squat Ends
The squatters who occupied the
former Libyan Consulate in Princes
Gate were finally evicted in the early
hours of 29th July when police were
called in after a disturbance at a
party being held there. The
squatters were due to be moved out
after an eviction order was granted
in the High Court and most had
already gone by that time. Those
remaining organised a party during
which severe damage was done to
the building and 30 people were
arrested. It was estimated that the
cost of the damage to the Consulate
was between £1 million and £2
million.
Union Licenced
The takeover of the Union Bar was
completed earlier this month when
Union Administrator Jen Hardy-
Smith and Dr Bob Schroter took
over as licencees.
Eric Awarded
IC Rector Professor Eric Ash has
been awarded a Royal Society Royal
Medal for 'outstanding researches
on acoustic microscopy leading to
wholly new techniques'.
Prof Ash was one of the first to
recognise the possibilities of using
surface acoustic waves in delay lines,
now used extensively in TV and
radio receivers. More recently, with
his group at UCL, he has developed
a scanning acoustic microscope with
a greater resolution than optical
microscopes, and also shown how
surface acoustic waves can be used
to characterise materials.
Silver For Parsons
Imperial College high jumper Geoff
Parsons from the Min Res Eng
Department won a silver medal in
the Commonwealth Games at
Edinburgh when he cleared a height
of 2.28m.
Queen's Tower
The Queen's Tower was opened to
the general public for thefirsttime
this summer. College Assistant
Secretary Michael Arthur
organised the scheme and £15,000
was spent on remedial and safety
work to the Tower. Eight students
were employed to act as guides,
though this was reduced to two
when the number of visitors did not
meet expectations.

Buried Treasure
Mining excavations at Harlington,
IC's sports ground, have uncovered
a site of some archealogical interest.
In the area where the subsoil has
been removed two wells have been
found each around 4m in diameter.
Fragments of pottery, dated at
around 1000BC have been
recovered from the first of these.
The site will be available for
archealogical study until the gravel
is mined in December/January.
