FELIX, Friday September 29 1986 1 9
Because film making is such a
collaborative activity their are
many occasion when some
compromise is required between
the unions of the various
contributors. According to writer
Nicholas Kazan and producer
Elliot Lewitt their original intention
for At Close Range is very
different from director James
Foley, and actor Sean Penn's final
product. It is obviously impossible
to judge the film that has never
made so I can only comment on the
version now on release and it does
not apear to be as bad as Kazen
and Lewitt would have it.
The film is another example of
the incredible behaviour of one
individual. It tells the tale of a young
man's attempt to emulate his
criminal father by forming his own
gang and committing fairly petty
crimes. However.when the son's
incompetence and knowledge
becomes dangerous to the father
he sets about eliminating the boy's
gang and finally, puts a $15,000
AT CLOSE RANGE
contract out on his son's life.
What is particularly remakable
about the story is that all the
important plot elements are based
on the real life exploits of Bruce
Johnson Sr.
Athough the 'Greek tragedy'
nature has been played down,
which results in a rather superficial
film. It is nevertheless a powerful
story with some wonderful
photography in which both Sean
Penn and Christopher Walke are
allowed to exploit their
considerable talents. It is a shame
however that the most interesting
character played by Walke, is not
â€¢allowed sufficerit time to develop
and that this part is sacrificed in
order that Sean Penn remains the
star. As Nicholas Kazan pointed
out when he asked the distributors
if he could re-edit the film at his
own expense: 'Would you rather
, riaue a bad film which Sean Penn
likes or a good film which he
doesn't'. Such is the power of
young actors.
....BRIEFLY
TROUBLE
One way of avoiding clashes
between writer and director is for
one person to do both and this is
Alan Rudolph's prefered way of
working. In order to achieve this
his tendency is to make budget
films, often independently.
However, his latest film, Trouble
in Mind is a studio production,
albeit a relatively cheap one as
Hollywood films go. It is set a short
time in the future and is an essay in
the corrupting nature of the 'City'
as Coop (Keith Carradine) says
before he even goes to 'Rain City',
'I've been to plenty of cities and
they aren't nothing but trouble.'
Sure enough when he gets there
with his partner and child he is
slowly drawn into the sleezy
underworld. Alan Rudolph's
greatest achievement is creating a
fantasy world full of exotic
characters and bizarre occurences
and yet at the same time manages
to keep the whole story credible
and involving. He also had a nice
way with words saving most of the
best lines for the sometime hero
Hawk, Kris Kristofferson, who
gives a marvellous performance as
an ex-cop, ex-convict and a man
destined to clash with Rain City's
King of Crime, Billy Blue.
The script also allows for some
interesting and independent
female characters. Wanda, a cafe
owner excellently played by
Genevieve Bujold and Lori Singer
slightly less well played as Keith
Carradine's partner. An
entertaining film, and any film with
a song that contains the line, 'one
love is only found down in your
pants', can't be all bad.
The Legend of Swan Fortress
is a Russian film directed by
Paradjanor, who also directed the
aclaimed The Colour of
Pomegrantes. Because Russia
rarely has many Western films to
compare it's film industry with, it
has developed along poetic and
sculptural lines independent of
American narrative style film. As a
result Russian films are very
difficult to watch and appear very
slow. This one concerns the folk
tale of Swan Fortress which would
only remain standing when
someone was walled up in the
foundations is unfortunately no
exception, and it certainly isn't
helped by some poor photography.
The Decline of the American
Empire is a French-Canadian
adult comedy. It concerns the
activities of a group of well
educated middle-aged men and
women discussing their sexual
hangups, and as such is a fairly
annoying and unfunny exercise,
particularly because all the
characters are wholly unsym-
pathetic.
Girl in a Boot is a rather sweet
tale of a E.German girl who falls in
love with a chef who works at the
Swiss Embassy and follows their
adventure when they decide to
take day trips over to the West. A
nice little story with a not
sufficiently powerful sad ending.
Invaders from Mars is a
remake of the 1953 version and as
such is a good insight into the way
in which society and science has
moved on since that period.
Although attempts are made to
modernise the story, by suggesting
that the Martian probes launched
in the 70's actually found
something but that this was
hushed up. The film is really weak
and it is apparent from a couple of
moments that it fails to .generate
the laughter intended. The story
concerns the attempts of a young
boy to alert the world to the evil
activities of a spaceship that lands
near his house, these effort are
thwarted by the fact that the
Martians keep 'hypnotising' the
locals. The original film was very
much a product of it's age and
should never have been remade.
Poltergeist 2, Oh dear. Once
again the Freeling family are
toubled by bumps in the night and
manic preachers. Apart from some
good lines by the father, Craig T
Nelson, this is an embarrasing and
appalling film with one of the least
credible monsters I have ever seen.
Still it did good busines in the
States so what do I know.
