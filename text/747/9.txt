Chris Hall on Imperial's neighbour and namesake-Ithaca College
It wouldn't be unreasonable to
assume that most students at
Imperial could readily identify that
centre of education known
informally as IC. But then why not,
for that has been the nickname for
Imperial for years, but then how
many people know of the IC in
upstate New York? Further more,
why should it concern them?
For a group of 140 students
residing in the around the
Gloucester Road area, IC means
ITHACA College, again the name
the College has been known by for
years. Ithaca College is a private
college of 5000 students in upstate
New York. In many ways very
similar to Imperial, it has a strong
Science and Technology program,
publishes its own newspaper, and
runs a television studio and a radio
station. Unlike Imperial it lies in the
small college town of Ithaca NY,
overlooking the finger lakes and
across the hill from Cornell
University. Originally a music
conservatory, today Ithaca has an
excellent communications program
and a branch in London. This is
where IC and IC come together.
Ithaca London Centre, one of the
five American Universities to be a
part of Imperial, is situated in
Harrington Gardens, about a mile
from Imperial. While many of the
students who attend the London
Centre come from Ithaca (NY),
some come from other institutions
across the country. The London
Centre is one of the only American
Universities to teach in the 'English'
system, thought by many to be
stronger and more concise than the
'American' system.
The Freshman programme at
Ithaca London is almost unique. It
is unusual for most college students
to take a semester or a year abroad
until at earliest the sophomore (2nd)
year. The Freshman programme
serves a double purpose, a unique
program for American freshmen
and a preparation ground for those
foreign students who might wish to
make the adjustment to an
American University. For while
almost all of the teachers at the
Centre are English, the courses are
similar to those that might be taken
back on the home campus in New
York, only here they are taught in
the English method.
From the exposure to Imperial,
students can still see the many
differences between the American
and English Universities and
colleges. Sports are far more
important to American Colleges,
and weekends are reserved for
athletic competition which many in
the colleges will turn out to watch.
Football (American), Soccer
(English football), hockey (ice, not
usually field), basket ball, and
lacrosse are just some examples of
popular american sports. The
debate still rages between
Americans and English; 'is rugby
tougher than football?' Even most
Americans will conceed this, for it is
probably the largest sport the two
different systems have in common.
It is interesting to note that the
drinkng age in England is only 18,
whereas in most States in the
country it is 21 and strictly enforced.
Probably it is why alcohol is not
looked at in this country as it is in
the States, for now many college
bars are being forced to close down
because of the business that is lost
due to the drinking age.
If there is truly anything that all
students love it is the pub, which is
really non-existent in the United
States. A pub is a place for
socializing as well as for drinkng, a
Adjusting to the
great British sense
of humour is a
challenge. While
most colleges have
a prank squad, it
seems that the Rag
Fete, and the Rag
Mag are unrivalled
place to strike up conversations with
the person sitting next to you. It has
the social aura to it that makes a bar
(in the States) seem impersonal and
cold. It always seems that everybody
knows everyone, in whatever pub
you go to. Bars are usually quieter
(unless it is a college bar) for people
tend to stick to themselves.
Adjusting to the great British
sense of humour is also a challenge.
While most colleges have a prank
squad, it seems the Rag Fete, and
the Rag Mag are unrivalled, (except
at MIT where they put cars on top of
buildings.)
With the help of Dave Colley ICU
Hon Sec it seems that the overseas
students are finally getting the hang
of things at Imperial. The different
clubs, activities and sports (not to
mention the Union Bar are
presenting challenges. For Ithaca
students, IC is no further away than
a mile!
Tuesday September 23 saw IC's
five American Associate Colleges
come togetherfor an Americanfest in
the Union Bar. About 100 students
from Florida State, Michigan, Texas,
Missouri and Ithaca gathered to
drink Budweiser and attempt to play
darts while geting to know some IC
students. The fest, organised by ICU
Honorary Secretary Dave Colley and
Union Bar Manager Kev Buckley was
a resounding success. Much of the
success Imperial has enjoyed with its
American counterparts is due to the
efforts of Dave Colley who spent a
good deal of time during the summer
communicating with the Americans
and getting them linked together.
