THEATRE
FELIX, Friday September 29 1986 20
The Mermaid Theatre until
October 18th.
This adaption by Steven Berkoff
of Kafka's classic story of mans' self-
debasement is near perfect. The
alienation and divorcement from
reality of characters and plot allow
Kafka/Berkoff to strike with purity
at the centre of mans' soul;
revealing all.
The unfortunate Gregor awakes
early one morning to find that he
can not leave for work in order to
earn for his needy parents and
sister, since he has started to
metamorphose into a Dung Beetle.
Gregor's transformation is soon
discovered by his family and the
effect this has on them is explored
as their feelings change from pain
and anguish to disgust and
disinterest. Finally, rejected and
wounded by his father, Gregor is
left to die.
On a climbing frame set which
radiates from his bedroom Tim
Roth as Gregor shows an agility and
intensity of performance that soak
his supporting characters in a 'light'
that burns very bright. Similarly,
Berkoffs direction and control over
the action is masterful and precise.
The fine detail of all the performers
is beautifully simple and
understated.

Have you noticed how stale
comedy seems to be at present.
The other night I sat at home and
watched TV for the first time in
ages. Britains 'radical' Channel 4
was showing a comedy called 'A
Fairly Secret Army'. 1 have rarely
been more bored. The programme
was meant to be 'Guardian
credible' as it was about a bunch of
facist buffoons who form an army.
I'd be surprised if anyone found it
believable. It was flat, dry and
unimaginative. The problem with
comedy seems to be that there is
little new material that is original
that people can relate too. This is
why a trip to Bouncers (Arts
Theatre) is so worthwhile.
Bouncers is about a small town
nightclub and anyone who has
been to Bentley's in Stockton or
Bogart's in Harrow or any other
small town nightclub will relate to
the play. All types of people are
portrayed: The underaged girls'on
the pill'; the 'pissed up lads'; the
college rugby players and the
smoothies with cars. Although Hull
Truck's production makes you
laugh at all these characters, it is
also sympathetic and warm to
them. It's very easy to laugh at
sterotypes because the images
presented make you feel superior
and safe, but Hull Truck avoid this.
When you think about the
characters you find yourself
identifying with them.
Bouncers is a great night out.
