FELIX -
25 Years Ago
The place is now crawling with
freshers. Among this horrid horde
are a small number of hopeful
young ladies. But disillusion will
soon set in; we know, because it
happened to us and now that we're
old and battered inhabitants we will
pass on to them the benefits of our
experience-it's no use husband-
hunting here, because the only types
available are:-
1 The Majority. They work; make
feeble scientific jokes and to home
to Putney (or Chiswick) at 5pm
sharp. If they notice you at all see
item 4.
2 The Hop Pickers These look for a
new girlfriend every Saturday night.
They don't like us; they only
appreciate girls from training
colleges. (What do they train for?)
3 The Athletes. Superficially these
may appear attractive. But beware-
they're either out 'drinking with the
boys' or else 'rowing in the head
tomorrow'. Either way, you get
neglected.
4 The Inexperienced This is the lad
who says 'What would you like to
do, dear?' and doesn't like what you
tell him.
5 The Experienced. He assumes
what you want to do and is nearly
always wrong.
6 The Perfect Man. He is engaged.
Cassandra.
