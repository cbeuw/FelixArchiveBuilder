yourtimein education?
You don't need us to tell you hew time
seems to be wasted with the unproductive
side of teaching and learning. Papers that
have to be re-worked because of typing
mistakes, frantic searches through card
indexes for a vital date or statistic, maps and
diagrams to be drawn and labelled. There is
a solution. Something that will help you to
organise and present work to a degree you
probably haven't dreamed about. It's called
a Macintosh"'. Once you've tried it you'll be
hooked.
But don't take our word for it. Talk to any
of the thousands of students and faculty
members who have already made our
computer an indispensible tool in more
than 100 of the world's top universities.
