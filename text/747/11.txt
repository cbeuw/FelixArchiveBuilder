FELIX FELIX, Friday September 29 1986 1 1
F r e s h e r s wed
Old man of FELIX Hugh Southey takes
time off from buying wedding rings to look
at the traumas of Freshers Week
Freshers' Week is different
things to different people: The
most frightening experience of
your life'; 'A chance to make
new friends'; 'A drunken orgy';
Tremendous fun'; 'A lonely
time when nobody seems to be
your friend'; 'An exilerating
experience'. As a result it is
difficult to write about. You
may well find that you have a
great time and ignore
everything in this article. Just
remember, however strange the
College may seem at present,
within a week you will probably
have made the place home.
Freshers' Week starts on
Monday morning with the
Rector's Reception, an event
that everyone goes to and
wishes they hadn't. In the
afternoon the Constituent
College Unions hold General
Meetings. These are very light-
hearted affairs, so if you want
to get involved in student
politics you'll have to wait until
the IC UGM which is a week
Tuesday (October 7). At the
CCUGMs you'll find out about
the chants and mascots of the
CCUs. Make sure you go to
the New Year's Party (featuring
Buddy Curtis and the
Grasshoppers). Find some
people from your Hall or
House to go with and by the
end of the evening they'll be
firm friends.
During Freshers' Week don't
be afraid to walk up to
strangers and talk to them.
They'll probably be Freshers
like you and so looking for
people to talk to.
Tuesday afternoon is
Freshers' Fair. Don't miss this.
It is your chance to see all the
Union Clubs. Whatever
interests you have you'll find
there is someone with similar
interests. Take the plan or
guide to Freshers' Fair which is
on this page and the next two
pages. And decide which clubs
might possibly interest you and
go and visit them all. Freshers'
Fair is followed by a fancy
dress party in the evening.
Unfortunately lectures start
on Wednesday morning, but
don't worry; you get the
afternoon free so that you can
play in the sports trials at
Harlington. Details of the trials
will be available from the
sports clubs at Freshers' Fair.
On Wednesday evening
Mines have organised a
barnight, RCS have organised
a pub crawl, Guilds have
organised a trip ice skating and
Ents have organised an
alternative comedy night. This
is all changed round on
Thursday with Mines going on
a pub crawl and RCS going ice
skating.
Freshers' Ball is on Friday. It
is the party of the week. The
whole of the Union Building is
taken over by Ents who have
organised bands, discos and
films. Furniture, who had a
chart hit recently with 'Brilliant
Mind', headline.
After you have been up until
the early hours of the morning
at Freshers' Ball try and get up
to go tiddlywinking. The Rag
article (on the page opposite)
tells you about this.
One event that is worth
mentioning, even though it isn't
really part of Freshers' Week, is
the first IC UGM which is a
week on Tuesday (7 October).
It is your chance to debate real
student issues and change the
way your Union is run. Don't
miss it!
Anyway, enjoy Freshers'
Week and hopefully by the end
of it College won't seem such a
strange place.
