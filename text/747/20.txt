FELIX, Friday September 29 1986 21
The Half Moon Theatre until
October 11th.
The handout for this new
Berkoff play, which examines the
events surrounding the fateful
sinking of the Argentine cruiser
General Belgrano, asks what is
funny about the death of 368 young
men and replies: 'Steven Berkoffs
SINK THE BELGRANO, that's
what...' Unfortunatly, despite
some clever lyrical words and
generally good acting, Sink the
Belgrano! is neither funny nor
particularly moving.
Set in April and May 1982 the
action revolves around: The Prime
Minister (Maggot); The Secretary
of State for Defence (Nit); and
Foreign Secretary (Pimp). Their
stupidity and one-sided
presentation attempts to provoke
laughter; but, despite a strong
performance from Maggie Steed as
Maggot, the feeling is that Berkoffs
combination of verse, horror at the
events that occured, and
humorous disbelief of political
machinery lacks direction. Rather
than being dragged from one
emotional extreme to the other the
audience are left unaffected.
More effective are the rhythmic
chorus. Six-Bash the Argies, 'Tits
like Melons'-working men who
double up as Soldiers, Sailors
writing to their loved ones, Harrier
jets and finally the dead.
Maggot's ratings at the polls,
(27% before the Malvinas
/Falklands conflict, 45% after)
conclude a play that seems self-
defeating and confused in terms of
what it desires to achieve.
However, the closing line leaves
little doubt as to the Governments'
wish: 'I would do it again'
Maggot/Margaret Thatcher.

When you were young and
innocent and choosing a
university, the Imperial College
Prospectus 86/87 promised you
that the Haldane Library
'contains in pleasantly informal
surroundings some 34,000
books on a very wide range of
subjects including a collection
of fiction'
The Haldane Library does, to its
credit have pleasantly informal
surroundings with comfy seats and
a fine selection of the newspapers
and periodicals that you live to
read, but cannot afford to buy
(Punch, Private Eye, The Financial
Times etc.) It also has a good
record and tape library, with
something for all tastes, and a
friendly and helpful staff.
...Books....Who said books
....What Books?
The selection of fiction in the
Haldane is the worst I have ever
seen even in a small branch library.
Imperial College's well deserved
reputation for illiteracy does not
excuse a collection of books which
appear to be derived from the
rejects of Edwardian Boarding
School libraries. There are some
exceptions, like the Emma Lathen
books, American detective writing
at its best; also Sartre and Isaac
Bashevis Singer. In an effort to do
justice to the Haldane I have
picked out a few books in fairly new
dust jackets:
How Green Was My Valley by
Richard Llewellyn is the best book I
found, and probably the best book
in the library. It is the story of a
Welsh mining family and their
valley seen through the eyes of
Huw Morgan, who grows up there
around the turn of the century. It
comes as a shock to find that
1
strikers' children starved to death
in our grandparents time. The tale
j of the life and loves of Huw Morgan
i may help us English to discover
| why the Welsh hate us so much;
after all, we were not beaten for
speaking our native language at
school.
Fire from Heaven by Mary
Renault is also set in a foreign
country only thistameit is Greece
around 330 years B C This work is
part of a series on Alexander the
Great. Here his childhood and
youth are displayed, making a very
readable tale that also has great
(historical accuracy. The farming
methods, eating habits, warfare,
and culture are all dealt with.
Alexander is found in the middle
of an ancient 'Kramer vs Kramer'
â€” his parents, King Philip the
Great and Queen Olympas witch
and priestess of Bacchus, fight
over him and ultimately over the
Kingdom; the story ends with King
Philip's murder. Alexander is
portrayed as perfect which cannot
be true, but the richness of detail
contained within Fire from Heaven
left me with a yen to read the other
books of Ms. Renault; Funeral
Games, The Last of the Wine, and
The Mask of Apollo.
The last book, The Crucified
City by Peter Van Greenaway
does not measure up to the others.
The 'Bomb' drops on London one
Maundy Thursday, and a bunch of
survivors walk to Aldermaston
before they die. Badly over-written
and full of sterotypes I wouldn't
recommend this book to anyone.
