Down and Out in London is a
column which looks at
forthcoming events and activities
outside College with an
occasional dose of social
conscience. It's precursor 'Capital
Ideas' managed to spot the likes
of Half Man, Half Biscuit and
Zodiac Mindwarp before they
were even a glimmer in the Indie
charts, and celebrated Valentines
day with an apocalyptic
massacre. Hopefully we can be as
perceptive this year - although
some would say noticing Zodiac
Mindwarp scores very low on
perception points. We also
promise regular readers from last
year some changes for the better
and especially that our itinerant
Albanian mountain cyclist is on
Holiday on K2.
If you're new to London and
have an IQ of 25 or more you
will probably be struck by the
plethora of just about everything
in the indoor leisure field. If you
haven't, and you've just come out
of hyperspace deep-sleep on the
Ml for the last million years,
then a look in one of the listings
entertainment as a good reason
for doing so. There are probably
still a lot of you out there who
haven't yet lost your copy of the
Handbook under a ton of
'bumph', so I will try to avoid
duplicating all the good advice in
that ubiquitous volume.
Eventually most of us will stray
away from the fabulous delights
of Imperial and some may even
help to dispel the myth of
technology students as insular
Philistines.
Most people will see reviews of
mainstream films and theatre
elsewhere, added to which these
things are not exactly free. So
Down and Out is being sent on a
one year mission to seek out and
explore radical entertainment, to
meet cheap alternatives and to
sink below standards of writing
where not even SF Soc articles
have gone before. The cheapest
entertainment is free, and yet cost
is no measure of the quality of
some of the busking acts who
populate strategic nooks in the
realm of LRT a.k.a London
Transport. Now, standing around
mags is worthwhile. The free
ones such as LAM are good for
films but Time Out and the more
radical City Limits are more
comprehensive. After a short
acclimatisation you will begin to
suss the economic facts of life
faster than any lecturer could
drum them home. You may well
conclude that the government do
not actually intend you to enjoy
yourself while you are here.
Unless you're the sort of weirdo
whose daddy is a shipping
magnate then forever
nightclubbing the hours of
darkness away is a big non-
starter except for special
occasions.
Nevertheless, most students who
come to London see
in tunnels is not the best way to
listen to music although South
Ken subway does have great
reverb. Venues such as the
Albert Hall and the omnipresent
Hammersmith Odeon are
beginning to get expensive, added
to which the Odeon is completely
lacking in atmosphere. Two
rather better veneus which attract
'name' bands are the
Hammersmith Palais and the
Town and Country Club in
Kentish Town. October 10 at the
Town and Country, which has
both dance space and seating,
sees Andy Kershaw favourite
Robin Hitchcock with his band
be worth a look. There are
concessions between 6-8pm
Monday to Wednesday.
Closer to home the V&A have a
photography exhibition showing
a general history of some of the
best work of the top names
entitled Masterpieces of
Photography. Remember you
don't HAVE to pay to get in to
the V&A and just because it is an
art museum its not only for
tourists. The Boilerhouse section
which specialises in design should
be of special interest to
commercially minded engineers.
The Egyptians. Then on October
28 the Hammersmith Palais
features a concert by cult
American band The Residents.
The Residents, although not
widely known in the mainstream
music world, seem to propagate
their enigmatic influence to the
most curious of quarters.
Instance a characteristic 'eyeball
head' T-shirt displayed by Half
Man, Half Biscuit at
Glastonbury. They experiment
considerably with surrealism and
their rare and virtually
unadvertised live show can best
be expected to be very strange
indeed.
If you are curious about
surrealism and interested in going
to see gallery type exhibitions
then VAmour Fou: Photography
and Surrealism at the Hayward
Gallery on the South Bank could
Well , for once I've reached the
end of an article without
plugging the Autumn Hawkwind
tour, which, incidentally, visits
Hammersmith Odeon on
November 27 and 28. Once again
I suppose your humble scribe and
Eugene, and the rest of the
Albania chapter of the Hells
Angels will roll along to prove
some things never change. And
finally, Uncle Dan the Ents man
has just pointed out to me that
the NME gig guide actually
highlights the tours of all the
bands he has booked for this
week, so maybe I won't have to
look so far afield in future. See
you next week, and remember,
don't do anything I wouldn't do,
and if you do, do it well...
