FELIX FELIX, Friday September 29 1986 6
E l B S I H
For those of you who weren't here
last year, 'Megabrain' is FELIX's
regular puzzle column. Each week
there's a £5 prize for a randomly
selected winner picked after 1.00pm
Wednesday, although this deadline
changes occasionally. The puzzles
vary in difficulty and type so don't
give up if you find any particular
problem too hard. I always need
puzzles, so if you know any kind of
problem that would be suitable
write it down with your name and
hand it in. All solutions and new
puzzles should be given in at the
FELIX office.
Room Roulette
Ian Visible, the subwarden of
Newt Hall, Priceless Gardens, is
having more than his fair share of
Beginning-of-year hassles. Eight
freshers: Stuart, Tina, Ursula,
Vanessa, William, Xavier, Yvonne,
and Zack; checking the hall picture
board, have discovered that they're
in the wrong rooms. Instead of
sorting it out by themselves, they've
left Ian this set of rather cryptic
notes.
'I'm in the room of the person
who's in the room of the person
who's in the room of the person
who's in the room of the person in
my room. Please sort this out.
Stuart'.
'I'm in the room of the person
who's in the room of the person in
Xavier's room. What should I do?
Yvonne.'
'I'm in the room of the person
who's in the room of the person in
my room. Are you going to do
anything about it? Tina.'
There were also three other
unsigned notes, no two from the
same person (judging by the
handwriting) which all said 'I am in
the room next to the room I'm
meant to be in.' But Ursula,who was
a friend of Ian's, said that she had
not written any of the notes.
Given that the students should be
in the rooms, which are side-by-side
in a line, in alphabetical order, can
you tell who's in whose room?
U n i o n B a r
The Union Bar in Beit has been
taken over by Imperial College
Union and a new manager Kevin
Buckley has been appointed. The
three permanent members of staff
were all students at one time and as
such know the special needs of the
Imperial College members. They
are keen to emphasise that bawdy
barnights are the exception rather
than the rule and that the main bar
is a great place to meet for a beer. If
you do wish to watch television
then the brand new Lounge Bar is
available next door. There is a large
selection of beers plus all manner of
spirits and soft drinks and because
it's owned by your Union, all the
profit is yours eventually.
Any complaints you may have
should be taken first to the Bar
Manager rather than directly to a
Sabbatical as stated in the
Handbook and any constructive
suggestions will be gratefully
received.

F I L O F A X
The creators of the illustrious
F I L O F A X , the invaluable
accessory for every businessman,
accountant and professional
poseur, have announced the latest
addition to their range of products.
The makers have been swamped by
letters from people who don't have
enough addresses to fill their new
acquisitions and have to cope with
the spectacle of showing off
embarrassing white spaces when
they open it up to look for a phone
number. To cope with this problem
they have brought out packets of
specially created false addresses.
The packages are available in a
range of handwriting styles to match
your own. Choose from styles like
'Neat Capitals', 'Secondary School',
'Spidery' and 'Doctor'. Each
package is individually band crafted
by specialists, and comes complete
with instructions explaining exactly
who each person is, and the size of
their expense account.
At £30 per 20 pages the package is
a real snip for the image conscious
eighties.

SONO have recently lauched the
latest in a range of Walkmans,
specially designed for all those
people on the tube who have to
really strain to listen to the Level 42
album being played by the person in
the next seat.
A spokesman from SONO told
us. "The problem lies with the
speakers of a Walkman being fitted
into the ears of the person wearing
it. This means that the public all
around can only hear a tinny sort of
tish-pop-tush sound all the time,
which for a generation raised on
compact discs and 10 inch woofers
just isn't good enough. Even adding
a graphic equalizer doesn't alleviate
the problem."
SONO have neatly circumvented
the quality problem by making the
speakers 10 times larger and taking
the unprecedented step of fixing
them to the cassette recorder itself,
rather than to the owner's head. To
cope with the much larger bulk of
the new Walkman, SONO have also
had to devise a totally new system of
carrying the unit. They have so far
failed to come up with a proper
name for this, and are currently
experimenting with the term
'handle'.
"We believe that the GTO-
BLSTR 1 is a major breakthrough
in the design of Walkman public
address systems," say SONO.
