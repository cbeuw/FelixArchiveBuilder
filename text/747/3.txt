FELIX Office Move
The FELIX Office move has been
delayed once again, though the new
premises are expected to be
available from the beginning of this.
week. The original date of
completion agreed with the
contractors was August 31st, and
the building work has been
rescheduled several times during
September. The move of the office is
now likely to last for a number of
weeks, in order to allow the
production of FELIX to proceed.
The majority of this issue has been
printed outside the Union Print
Unit, because of technical
difficulties imposed by the
impending move. The new FELIX
Office has been converted from the
derelict kitchens behind the Lounge,
previously the Union Lower
Refectory. FELIX has been situated
in Beit archway, in rooms which
were formally the IC Union Office,
since the acquisition of the Print
Unit in 1974. The FELIX editorship
has been a full sabbatical since that
date.
RCS Office Move
The Royal College of Science
Union office, currently situated in
Southside, may be moving. After
major building work, which made
access impossible unless students
possessed keys to Southside Halls
of residence, College offered a new
site in Chemistry. The proposed
room is the timberstore which is
located directly over the Motor
Club garage and which is twice as
large as the present site. It also

offers 24 hour access. RCSU
officers, however, are concerned
about the old Chemistry block
being demolished in the near
future. They hope to have the issue
discussed at the next UGM.
The timberstore is being cleared
to give RCSU officers the
opportunity of inspecting the
proposed site. Students are advised
not to park their cars in the vicinity
of the store. (See pages 1 and 24).
DES Course
The Government has announced a
study to evaluate and develop
leadership courses for senior
university staff. The study, for
which the DES is providing
Â£37,126 over two years, will take
place at Surrey University. Its
purpose is to evaluate the
programme of leadership courses
already being run at Surrey and to
research how they may be
extended. It will also develop new
courses in finance, marketing and
staff development.
Accommodation
Once again term has begun with a
mad rush to get Houses in Evelyn
Gardens is-sidy for first year students
to move into. At the same time the
staff of <
J
i
e Student Services Office
have had to work exceptionally hard
in order to accommodate all those
students who are guaranteed places in
College Halls, Houses and Head
Tenancies. If only a handful more
'entitled' students had applied,
Student Services would have had little
option but to turn them down.
I accept that the College is, to a
certain extent, at the mercy of the
contractors where the alteration work
is concerned, but that the same
situation should arise two years
running is indicative of lue
administration's unconcerned
attitude. It is intolerable that the
Evelyn Gardens Wardens and re-apps
should be landed with the job of
clearing up the Houses overnight, so
as to make them habitable for
Freshers, and, more significantly
perhaps, to avoid distressing parents.
By the same token, the Student
Services office should not be
continually expected to cope with the
increasingly impossible task of
finding enough places.
I suggest to College once more
that, until such issues as the
inadequate provision of student
accommodation are resolved, no
amount of professional publicity will
prevent a deterioration in the quality
and quantity of applicants to the
College.
Barclays Issue
Those of you who are first year
students will have received a copy of
this year's ICU Handbook, including
an insert by Christine Taig (ICU
President), Jackie Peirce (Deputy
President), Hugh Southey (UGM
Chairman) and Mark Cottle
(External Affairs Officer). At the
time of the last FELIX I was unaware
that the decision to include this
handout was not one made by the
ICU Executive. I repeat my
unequivical support for the sentiment
of this insert, and for the UGM
motion on Barclays, but I am
extremely unhappy over the manner
in which this decision was taken. Had
Christine and Jackie chosen to
execute the Exec's power of veto at
the correct time, they would have
acted entirely correctly, albeit in
anticipation (I hope) of Union Policy.
Even at the late stage when the insert
was included they would have been
able to give the leaflet more force by
backing it with an official Exec
decision, a majority one if necessary.
As it stands a Union publication has
been used as a vehicle for a political
leaflet prouuced by four prominent
students, with no formal Union
approval.
I concede that this is a procedural
argument only, but I would
recommend that such decisions are
formalised in future. I look forward to
a year of enlightened debate within
IC Union.
FELIX
FELIX is one of the very few student
newspapers to be produced and
printed entirely 'in-house'. The
content, layout and design are
exclusively the responsibility of the
si., tent staff and sabbatical editor.
For FELIX to flourish, and it is
imperative to a prosperous Union
that it does, we need a large student
staff who are interested in
contributing to their newspaper. We
shall be opening the Office on
Tuesday afternoon during Freshers'
Fair, so visit FELIX and we'll show
you a little of how the paper works.
On Thursday evening we will be
holding our first "Social Event" of
the year, which includes the Editor
buying drinks for everyone who turns
up to collate. This should start at
about 8pm, so give the frantic rush of
Freshers' Week a miss and come
along. There will be a staff meeting
for anyone who is interested in
working on the paper at 12.30pm on
Friday, October 3. If you would like
to write, draw, take photographs,
design pages or mind the folding
machine, please try to be there.
Credits
If this issue comes out at all it will be
due to the incredible hard work and
tolerance of a group of people who
have yet to tire of my
unprofesionalism. Particular thanks
to Chris Edwards, Judith Hackney
and Mark Cottle who have been
largely responsible for the
publication of this FELIX as well as
both the previous ones. My just
about expressible thanks also to
Mark Hunter and Fourth Avenue,
Chris Martin, Pete Higgs, Simon
Lewis, Chris Hall, Sunny Bains,
Colin Palmer, Hugh Southey,
Jackie Southey, Man Tai, Jane
Spiegel, Christine Taig, Dave
Colley, Rosemary Hosking, and

turns up to collate.
