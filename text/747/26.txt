Aimaunanza
mutually beneficial
arrangement for
bank and student.
At Lloyds Bank, we have come up with
a most persuasive argument for opening a
student account with us.
We'll automatically credit £10 to your
account, for starters.
And should you find yourself perilously
low on cash later on, we can let you have an
overdraft of up to £200 at the special rate of
1% a month.
That's equivalent to an effective annual
rate of 12'6%.
We'll also spare you expense by waiving
normal account charges, providing you stay
within that £200 limit.
And we'll issue you with a cheque card,
an Access card and a Cashpoint card for use
at over 1700 cash dispensers.
We can even provide your parents with
something to ease the burden.
Namely a Higher Education Loan on
very favourable terms.
And a Deed of Covenant form to help
them make the most of tax concessions,
should they wish to help supplement
your grant.
All in all, we can help make the task of
managing your financial affairs a much less
onerous one.
And we'll always be on hand to discuss a
personal loan, for instance, or simply to lend
you advice.
If you'd like to open an account with us,
write to Lloyds Bank Pic, Freepost, London
N4 1BR or call in at your local branch.
You could well learn something to your
advantage.
Nearest branches are at 67-69
Old Brompton Road, SW7 and
50 Gloucester Road, SW7.
