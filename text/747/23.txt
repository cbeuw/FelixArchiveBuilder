Loans On The Way
Education Secretary Kenneth Baker
hinted in his speech to the
Committee of Vice-Chancellors and
Principals in Edinburgh last week
that he was still considering the
introduction of student loans. His
predecessor, Sir Keith Joseph,
strongly advocated that students
should make a contribution to their
support by repaying some of the
cost after leaving higher education,
and Mr Baker reiterated this by
telling the Committee of Vice-
Chancellors and Principals that
students "will benefit materially as
well as intellectually from their
studies, and it seems paradoxical
that they should be so highly
subsidised by the average taxpayer,
whose earnings they will soon
overtake and leave behind".
However he was quick to stress that
any Government seeking to
introduce loans would have to be
convinced that it would not have
any disincentive effect on entry into
higher education. He also suggested
that employers should enter into a
combined grant/loan scheme of
student support by paying off loans
that students took out to finance
their education.
As well as discussing loans, he
also stressed that the present
Conservative Government will
allow no university to close under its
administration, instead he wanted
"to see a higher proportion of our
young people and more older
students going into higher
education of all kinds". Mr Baker
also wants to see greater selectivity
in research funding and the
rationalisation of some depart-
ments.

Ltd., who had been working
exceptionally hard to get the Houses
ready for the arrival ofthe students.
During the Summer, the site
foreman had left Solebrooks and
this had delayed the work
significantly; it had been necessary
to restrict the improvements to
Southwell House.
Union President Christine Taig
commented that the delay was
about 'par for the course' and that
more forward planning would have
alleviated the problem.
The parents of an incoming first
year student made a direct
complaint to College Secretary
John Smith about the condition of
the Evelyn Gardens accomm-
odation. Mr Smith gave his
assurance that the situation would
be remedied at once.
Mr Hallworth has written a letter
to all residents of Holbein and
Southwell Houses apologising for
the non-completion of the
improvement works.
University leaders have reluctantly
decided to support the principle of
introducing a mixed system of
student grants and loans. The
Committee of Vice-Chancellors and
Principals (CVCP) felt that such a
scheme was unavoidable if the
number of students in higher
education is to be substantially
increased. The committee feared
that, if grants were to be restored to
a reasonable level, this would be so
expensive that it would result in cuts
in student numbers.
Professor Fred Holliday, Vice-
Chancellor of Durham University
and chairman of the CVCP's awards
sub-committee, said of the meeting
last Wednesday: "Our top priority is
to get more students into higher
education. In our judgement
inadequate grants are blocking that.
We do not think that grants will be
restored to a proper level. Since
students can't study if they haven't
enough to live on, we are looking for
the most certain way of getting that
money for them."
Earlier this month, an education
minister claimed that a plan to look
at the viability of student loans will
not reduce the opportunities for
students from poorer backgrounds to
enter higher education. Mr George
Walden, Parliamentary Under-
Secretary of State for Education,
speaking at a Federation of
Conservative Students conference
said: "There is almost a conspiracy
of misinformation about the
Government's achievements in
higher education. We are educating
80,000 more students than in 1979 to
the same or better standards and the
same costs as before.
"Inevitably there is a point where
expansion costs money. That is one
reason we are taking a new look at
students' support, including the
possibility of loans."
Union number two Jackie Peirce and UGM Chairman Hugh Southey have
announced their engagement. The couple made their decision after a holiday
in Paris whichformer FELIX editor Hugh won in the raffle at last summers'
Rag Fete. FELIX can confirm that the proposal ocurred at lam on Tuesday
morning whilst Miss Peirce was recovering from a back injury.
Hugh looks set to make a FELIXfirst; no editor since 1974, when thepost
first became a sabbatical, has ever got married.
Both Mr Southey and Miss Peirce denied ever having appeared on
'Eastenders'.
Pool Award Tower Open
The swimming pool in the IC
Sports Centre is the first to receive
a prestigious award for energy
efficiency from the London
Electricity Board. The 'Beta' award
is given for major energy savings in
buildings measuring up to 1,000
square metres. The designer of the
pool's ventilation scheme, Graham
Manning, accepted the award
during a celebratory lunch at the
Savoy Hotel on September 9th.
The Queens Tower will be open to
visitors on Tuesday September 30,
the price of admission will be 60
pence. There is an excellent view of
London from the top of the Tower,
which is normally open to students
and the public on the day of Rag
Fete, but has been launched as a
tourist attraction over the summer.
The Tower is one of the tallest
buildings in London without a lift.
Vehicle
Flattened
A students' motor car was destroyed
last week when a large quantity of
wood was dumped on top of it. The
car, an R-registered mini belonging
to Mech. Eng. postgraduate David
Nicholson, had been parked at the
back of the chemistry building. A
firm of contactors, R. Bennet and
Sons, who were clearing out a
storeroom in Chemistry, threw out
the wood from afirstfloor balcony
which was directly above the car.
The front section of the roof of the
car was flattened to the level of the
seats.
Mr Nicholson said that the value
of the car was approximately Â£350.
Though not in a running condition,
there was a note in the car
explaining that it was under repair.
R. Bennet and Sons were hired by
Mr Peter Hallworth, managing
surveyor of Residences. Mr
Hallworth said that the contactors
must have thought that the car was
of no value since it was parked in the
vicinity of the RCS motor club,
where there is a selection of defunct
vehicles. He has advised Mr
Nicholson to contact his insurers, as
it is a matter between them and the
insurers for R. Bennet and Sons.
Transcendental
Society
A Transcendental Meditation
Society is being re-formed at IC this
term by members of RCS. Any
student who is interested in joining
should contact Paul Newman, an
astrophysics postgraduate, on
internal 6659. Mr Newman
described Transcendental
Meditation as a "simple, natural
means of allowing body and mind
deep rest and relaxation".
Bar Manager
Kevin Buckely has been appointed
as Union Bar Manager. Mr Buckley,
a former IC student, had been
employed as a manager in a
temporary capacity since the start of
July. Former ICU Hon Sec, Sean
Davis, has been appointed as
Barman.
Women's Tutor
Mrs Sandra Dawson, of the
Department of Social and
Economic Studies, has been
appointed as the new Senior Tutor
for Women Students. She replaces
Mrs Margaret Cunningham of the
Department of Computing.
