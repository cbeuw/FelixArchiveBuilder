BOAT CLUB - Gold for Britain -
Six members of Imperial College
Boat Club represented Great
Britain at World Championships
this summer. At the under-23 World
Championships in Hamburg, the
GB quadruple scull, including IC
men Nicholas Burfitt and Leon
Fletcher, crossed the line level with'
the French quad in the final, and
were awarded joint gold medals. A
third IC Oarsman, Guy Pooley, was
also in the GB U-23 Team.
At the Senior World Champion-
ships in Nottingham the U-23 quad
also competed but were outclassed
by much oldler and more
experienced opposition. A further
three IC oarsmen, John Griffiths,
Bill Downing and Chas Nelson,
were selected in the GB lightweight
eight which came eighth.
Earlier in the Summer, at Henley
Royal Regatta, the club's VIII
missed winning the Thames Cup by
a whisker. Having had the harder of
the two semi-finals on the Sunday
morning of the 5-day Regatta, they
met Canada's Ridley College, the
previous years' winner, in the final.
Unrecovered from the morning's
exertion IC lost by one and half
lengths. In the Visitors' Cup, which
IC won in 1985, both the club's VIIIs
got through to the semi-finals on
Saturday but progressed no
further.
The club had a total of sixty-four
wins last year, beating the record
set the previous year and making a
total of more than two hundred wins
over the last four years. This year
several members of the club are
likely to be called up to the national
squad.
IC CHOIR - Long Weekends -
Since its formation Imperial College
Choir has flourished under the
expert and indefatigable guidance
of Professor Eric Brown. It now
enjoys a reputation for
performances of a consistently high
standard. To maintain this
reputation the Choir needs new
members, and encourages them to
join as soon as possible. No
auditions are held, although each
individual should be able to keep in
tune with the rest of the Choir! Girls
are particularly welcomed to bolster
the ranks of the Sopranos and
Altos.
Rehearsals are held every
Thursday at 5.45pm in Mech Eng
room 342. Care is taken to ensure a
varied selection of music to suit all
tastes; last year composers varied
from Bach to Bernstein. Afterwards
coffee is served and new members
have the opportunity to socialise
and get to know everyone. For
those who are particularly keen
there is a Chamber Choir which
rehearses additional works later on
in the evening. Performances are
given once a term.
Long weekends are arranged in
the Christmas and Easter vacations
during which the Choir travels
outside London for rehearsals in a
different atmosphere.
Further details are available at
Freshers' Fair, or come to the first
rehearsal on Thursday October 2 at
5.45pm in Mech Eng 342.
SCOUT & GUIDE - Butties -
Lunchtime Butties is held every day
at 12.30 above Southside bar by IC
Scout and Guides. The club's main
activities are mountaineering, rock
climbing and caving. Frequent
weekend trips to various parts of
Britain are organised during the
year which offer an ideal
opportunity to get out of London
and away from it all.
Vacation tours, which last one
week are also arranged. This year
we plan to visit Fort William and the
Glencoe region at Christmas, and
Torridon at Easter. During the
summer there is a three week tour
abroad. The venue last year was the
Pyrenees.
S&G Club welcomes new
members of any year especially
Freshers. The club is an ideal
introduction to the activities
mentioned above, but if you are
already an experienced climber, so
much the better. Butties is a valued
social occasion, as well as a
convenient means of having lunch,
which enables members to keep in
touch easily.
Come along to butties or see us
at Freshers' Fair to find out more.
