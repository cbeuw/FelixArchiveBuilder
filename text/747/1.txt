"No Places" Policy
Student Services have been forced to adopt a "no
places for home postgraduates" policy owing to the
high demand for a reduced number of rooms in
College accommodation. Since the beginning of
September it has been clear that some of the students
who are normally allocated places would have to look
to the private sector. In addition, an increased
number of first year undergraduates have been given
places in head tenancy flats this year.
In total there are 1,400 spaces
available in College Halls and
Houses. This figure represents a
drop of about 30 from last year.
Student Services will expect to gain
a small number of places as
accommodation becomes available
during the next few months. All
undergraduate Freshers who
qualify as "away from home" are
awarded a single, double or triple
room. In addition, all overseas
postgraduate Freshers are
guaranteed places if they apply
when invited to do so. In previous
years, 40 of places available to
postgraduates have been given to
home students, and 160 to students
from overseas. Because of the fierce
demand, only 3 of the 100-150
home postgraduates who applied
and who were eligible for places
have received them; the remainder
of the 200 have been taken up by
overseas students who have
priority.
The squeeze on College Halls
and Houses is certain to create
more pressure for more College
accommodation to be found. There
are plans to build a new Hall above
the IC Sports Centre in Princes
Gardens, though the source of
funds for this has yet to be agreed.
Those who are having difficulty
in finding a place to stay are
advised to see Student Services
today.

Second Time Around
For the second year running, frantic
work was carried out in the last
week of the Summer Vacation in an
effort to get two of the Houses in
Evelyn Gardens ready for the
arrival of students. Both Holbein
and Southwell Houses have been
undergoing alteration and
decoration work similar to that
carried out on Willis Jackson House
twelve months ago, as part of a
rolling programme of work to bring
Evelyn Gardens into line with
housing regulations.
Peter Hallworth, Managing
Surveyor of Residences, said on
Friday that the work was only
'substantially complete', though, he
was confident that no student would
be asked to accept sub-standard
accommodation. He said that the
programme of work exceeded the
statutory alterations and had
included extensive redecoration as
well as some reflooring. He added
that there were lessons to be learnt
from the situation and that the scale
of the work had been over-
ambitious.
Mr Hallworth explained that it
was impossible to carry out the
necessary alterations other than at
Easter and during the long vacation
and hence the time available was
limited. It 'had been decided,
however, to raise the standard ofthe
accommodation and include the
extra work. Mr Hallworth said that
he had a good working relationship
with the contractors, Solebrook
