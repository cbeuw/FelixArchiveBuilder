Minimal Funk
Turn It To The House'
(Cleveland City)
Another top release from one of the
best record labels around. The Future
Shock Mix is a house-style track just ooz-
ing with funk and groove with just a hint
of progressive to it, whilst the Chant Mix
is a more deep, dub-style track. A
favourite of Pete Tong and Judge Jules,
this is a single which will make you bop
the night away.

J.D. Bralthwalte
'Give M e The Night'
(Caus-N'-ff-ct)
A cover of George Benson's 1980
classic, the 1999 version isn't as good as
the original (not that it ever could be).
The single comes with a host of remixes,
including one by Deep Dish (but we did-
n't get that), and is a modern house ver-
sion of George's classic. It's not bad, but
then as is often the case with covers it's
nothing to shout about.
Release date TBA.
Lynsey Moore
'Capture Me'
(Concept)
The debut single from a very tal-
ented star in the making. It combines
superb vocals with an energy evocative
of Cher (only much better than the plas-
tic fantastic pop queen). There's a whole
host of mixes giving it house, garage and
funk/ jazz interpretations. It's been a
favourite tune of Oakenfold's since
Xmas. Lots of choice and an all round top
tune.

The Tidy Girls EP
(TidyTrax)
Four of the UK's finest female hard
house DJs have teamed up to produce
four amazing hard house tracks. Rachel
Auburn, Lisa Lashes, Anne Savage and
Lisa Pin-Up have produced a package of
the highest quality. Each track is hard
house of the highest order, but each also
reflects the style of its producer. The
variation includes deep hard house and
a more energetic hard house track and
the whole EP lasts over thirty minutes.
Available on vinyl and CD.

Big Bud
'State O f Mind'
(Good Looking)
A good double A-side single from
one of Good Looking's finest artists. The
first side features a breakbeat single
called 'State Of Mind' with its gentle
pads, bouncing 808, beautiful break-
downs and very soulful, almost dreamy
vocals. The flip side is called 'Transmis-
sion' and is deeper than SOM. Hypnotic
beats and a mornful flute give this track
a very ominous flavour - you could almost
say it's a modern Mike Oldfield track.

Force and Paul
'Chocolate Bar'
(Compost)
Bavarian breakbeat producers Force
and Paul's latest drum and bass offering.
The single is a double A-side, with
'Chocolate Bar' being a funk fuelled D &
B track, whilst the second single, 'Blue
Movie', features the spooky sample of a
German film composer. The track starts
off very dark before kicking in with a no-
nonsense bass line. The flip side gives a
Jazzier/funkier mix but without losing
the original vibe.

'Reincarnations'
(Neo)
Excellent single on the Neo label
which is currently doing the business in
the nation's clubs. The original mix is a
combination of uplifting synths with a
very hard bass line, whilst the flip side mix
is an epic version akin to Sasha, i.e. very
deep, moody and mysterious. Having
been included on both Oakenfold's and
Scott Bond's Essential Mixes this is a very
eagerly awaited tune.

Kamaya Painters
'Endless Wave'
(Data)
Ministry of Sound's off-shoot label
comes up with this monster epic trance
tune. Produced by Gatecrasher's new
resident, DJ Tiesto, it is a track in the
mould of Ibizan house featuring deep
bass lines with a simple but effective
piano tune. There are two mixes on the
12". The Albion mix is a favourite of
Oakenfold, Digweed and Nick Warren,
whilst the Original mix is a favourite of
Tong, Jules and Graham Gold. I think
that says it all.

Autechre
EP7
(Warp)
The eclectic maestros produce the
goods in this very weird but very won-
derful EP. EP7 is fucking strange but has
the magic to keep you listening to it the
whole time. A mixture of Aphex Twin,
John Avery and The Future Sound of
London it's very eclectic and hypnotic.

'Come Down'
(Cheeky)
Excellent new single from the Diva.
The single is taken from the new album
and the music is eclectic in both style and
lyrical content. It comes with a host of
remixes giving it house/garage, funk and
dub interpretations. Great lyrics on an
excellent tune and plenty of choice. Why
can't everything be this good?

Double Six
'Breakdown'
(Multiply)
Good breakbeat single but is let
down by the fact that all the mixes sound
exactly the same. The track uses an indie
sound comparable to Blur on top of
some lively breaks, but sadly the mixes
aren't good enough.

Mike Koglin
' O n My Way"
(Multiply)
Brilliant epic euro-house with the
superb dreamy vocals of the beautiful
French singer Beatrice. A pumping bass
line with a catchy tune and those lucious
vocals have turned this track into a mas-
sive anthem not only here, but in the rest
of Europe too. The remixes are brilliant
with the Vocal Mix taking us through a
funky acidic journey, the Ruff Driverz
giving the track their fast energy club
beats workover and Tilt producing an
epic mix of huge quality.

Kektex
'Inner City Junkies'
(Tec H)
Apparently a "genre defining epic for
the 'avin it generation," but more like a
pile of bollocks to me. Dance music at its
most simple, there is nothing to keep
you interested in this tune, whether you
are just listening to it or jumping around
on the sort of dancefloor where they
may play this nonsense. Endless repeti-
tion of indecipherable raps and constant
siren noises are not really a recipe for
success these days, even if that may
have been the case in the distant, naive
past of club culture. One to miss out on,
unless of course you suffer from com-
pulsive/obsessive disorder and like to
