Wages of Sin - Sin Mission Pack 1 (PC)
Activision
It's rather tricky reviewing mission packs.
They're unlikely to contain any major
changes to the basic principles of the
original game, and will be of limited
interest to those who haven't played it.
In fact, now I come to think of it, I have
a suspicion that our Beloved Games Edi-
tor has given it to me because I avoided
my forfeit two weeks ago. Swings and
roundabouts. Anyway, here goes...
I first got my hands on Sin around
January, not long after it had been
released, but I wasn't actually able to
play it until March. Why? The control sys-
tem was the most bugged I have ever
come across - no matter how I installed
it, no matter what tweaks to the key
mapping I set up, every time I tried to
play the game, my point of view would
head remorselessly to the top of the
screen, and stay there. This was fine pro-
vided the targets were sit-
ting immediately above
me, but the first mission is
based in a helicopter, and
all that happened was that
I ended up shooting my
rotors out, with predictably
hilarious results. I was not
a happy bunny. In March,
Activision issued an 18 Meg
patch, and hey-presto, nor-
mal service was resumed.
For those of you who
haven't played the original
game, It was rather an enjoyable romp
through a large metropolis "in the near
future" where some bright spark has
devised a highly addictive drug which
turns its users in giant murderous mutant
things which appear from the sewers,
cause respectable quantities of mayhem
and then vanish leaving the civil author-
ities to wonder how it has all gone so
horribly wrong. It wasn't a hugely inno-
vative game, but it had some nice
touches (in one section, rather than
shoot people as per normal, you got to
drive over them using a beach buggy -
good for relaxing after a hard tube jour-
ney incidentally).
Wages of Sin (it's a pun, see) is set
immediately after the end of Sin. Despite
destroying the world domination plans of
the evil Alexis Sinclair and her unfeasibly
tight thigh-length boots and rather
skimpy garments (not
hugely PC this game),
and having her well and
truly behind bars, her
armies of mutants still
appear to be causing
mayhem - killing con-
struction workers, drop-
ping litter and generally
being anti-social and
emphatically anti-social. Your mission,
should you choose to accept it, is to go
and give them lessons in good citizen-
ship, if necessary using your trusty futur-
istic gun to reinforce the more
complicated paragraphs.
The first few levels are rather good
- they are set in pitch dark tunnels, the
only light source being the torch that you
picked up which is fast running out of
batteries. Once they fail,
there's a very good
chance you'll be set upon
by said mutants, with
resultant loss of large
quantities of bodily flu-
ids. There are a few puz-
zles, but none are
particularly complex, and
mostly test your ability to
run around pressing the
right buttons in the right
order within the right
time limit. Other than
that, its really just a mat-
ter of kill everything you see and collect
everything you can.
Don't get me wrong - this isn't a bad
game, and if you have the original Sin
(plus patch), and enjoyed that, then
there's a good argument for adding this
to it. But it really is purely down to "more
of the same", and I guess that more or
less sums up any good mission pack.

Age of Empires 2 - The Age of Kings (PC)
Microsoft
Less controversial than Kingpin by far is
Microsoft's Age of Empires 2. By now
most people would have taken Age of
Empires and the Rise of Rome expansion
set (see competition corner to win a
copy) and battled and planned through
to 500 AD or there abouts. Well this
Autumn Age of Empires 2 is about to take
• : . • .'
the story on that little bit further. It's time
to explore the age of kings, the dark
age and the time of renaissance and
exploration. Or as microsoft put it the
Dark Age, the Feudal Age, the Castle
Age and finally the Imperial Age.
With new very high resolution graph-
ics, cleaned up audio and a range of
fresh races the battle will
once again be on for ter-
ritory, food and resources.
The gameplay is still based
around the building of vil-
lages and towns to sup-
port a thriving and.
surviving community.
Balancing demands
of military and civilians will
be as difficult (or easy) as
before, on the levels we
got to play one one the
hardest problems was
keeping the local sheep
community from getting
M0
too frisky and wonder-
ing away - your sheep
have nice coloured
bows round their necks
Just so you know.
The military parts
of the game have also
been builted up too.
There is now the option
of leading troops to
their death in forma-
tions - synchronised
slaying on the scale not
seen since the two sec-
ondary schools nearby
decided to face off in
the backstreets. There is even the option
of garisoning your base much like the
scaredy kids who hung back at the school
gates.
There have even been tweaked and
tuned multiplayer game options. A cap-
ture the flag type game has been intro-
duced - a regicide option gives those
... :
SlSlSiS
'
players who abhor collateral damage a
simple way out. Kill the king and Queen
rather than teach the other race the
meaning of mass slaughter. Fun and
morals for all the republicans in the
familiy.
Once again Microsoft look to be rid-
ding on another winner.
