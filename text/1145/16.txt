D o d g e Caravans, h o c k e y teams,
the L o n g Island Expressway, sta-

W i n n e b a g o s , sexy travel agents, hous-

Jersey Shore, Buicks, asteroids, state
troopers, pianos falling out o f w i n d o w s ,
Lincoln T o w n Cars, s o c c e r m o m s ,
Bactine, KorN, Connecticut, love songs.
These are just a c o u p l e o f influences
the Fountains o f W a y n e state. With such
a, errrr, 'diverse' set o f factors as those
described above, its not suprising that
Utopia parkway is such an interesting
a l b u m .
Fountains o f W a y n e are a n o t h e r
b a n d f r o m t h e US not taking t h e stan-
dard ROCK path. Others to precede them
are acts such as W e e z e r a n d B e n Folds
Five. Chris C o l l i n g w o o d a n d A d a m
Schlesinger are t h e s o n g w r i t i n g t e a m
b e h i n d t h e b a n d a n d while t h e tunes in
this a l b u m are w h a t h o o k y o u in, the
lyrics are what keep y o u c o m i n g back for
m o r e .
This a l b u m deals with American sub-
urban life in its m a n y forms: all t h e a m b i -
t i o n , jealousy, b o r e d o m , h o p e a n d
regret. A Fine Day lor A Parade talks
about a n older w o m a n ' s drinking prob-
lems - a hauntingly beautiful track that
really m o v e s y o u to analyse t h e lyrics.
Prom T h e m e talks about h o w A m e r -
ican kids get ready for t h e p r o m night -
s o m e t h i n g w h i c h s e e m s to be a pivotal
m o m e n t in their lives a c c o r d i n g to this
s o n g . It's quite a sad s o n g , a n d a sad sit-
uation. That this night of ultimately empty
m o m e n t s is s e e n as ' a perfect m o m e n t '
is ironically glorified in this s o n g -1 can't
help w o n d e r i n g if the average US kid will
get it, t h o u g h . M a y b e that's t h e point.
There are also s o m e relentlessly
upbeat s o u n d i n g tracks o n t h e a l b u m
too. It Must Be Summer is a g o o d e x a m -
ple. From the rocking riffs y o u w o u l d
expect it to be quite a positive s o n g - but
delve a little deeper and y o u discover the
lyrics: 'The s u n is beating m e senseless,
I feel defenceless, like a dying lamb.' You
can really feel t h e anger at t h e excepted
n o r m in t h e US.
This is an easy a l b u m to listen to. All
the music is very A m e r i c a n college rock.
Nice safe beats a n d riffs, a bit o f hand
clapping, the occasional bit o f distortion
w h e n they really want to 'rock out' a n d
a f e w slow o n e s for dancing to. But if you
scrape a w a y t h e v e n e e r o f nice, y o u get
d o w n to t h e real stuff. This is an indict-
ment of t h e life of a n 'average' American
y o u n g person (this could be extended to
the average European's life too as w e are
so i n f l u e n c e d by US trends). Hopefully
this will give ' e m all a kick u p t h e prover-
bials.
All in all, it slides very nicely into
your e a r d r u m s a n d m a k e s y o u think!
What m o r e could y o u ask for? H

BEN FOLDS FIVE
The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold M e s s n e r Â£
Pop stars In suits. Whatever
will they think of next?
F
irst o f all, BFF are a three a n d not
a five. They comprise o f a piano,
a bass guitar a n d s o m e drums -
a l o n g with s o m e p e o p l e to play t h e m .
It's not a standard 3-piece set-up a n d as
such provides a refreshing break from
the n o r m . As well as this, BEF d o not
refrain f r o m bringing in s o m e string
a n d brass sections if they feel they
n e e d a larger s o u n d - as this a l b u m
s h o w s .
W e kick o f f t h e a l b u m with a bit o f
Narcolepsy A suitably rocking tune to
b e g i n o n . Towards t h e e n d s o m e m o r e
electronic influences start to permeate.
I don't k n o w w h y bands feel they have
to introduce these kind o f e l e m e n t s - it
just s e e m s to be t h e fashion right n o w .
They just about get away with it but y o u
can't help feeling it wasn't in t h e origi-
nal s o n g .
Best t u n e s of t h e a l b u m ? Magic
describes a close friend passing away
a n d h o w t h e writer is strangely happy
that they've 'traded places with an angel
n o w . ' Y o u can feel t h e pain in this track
- particularly in Ben Fold's emotive voice.
Armyls t h e first single to be used in the
UK f r o m t h e a l b u m . It really swings.
Relentlessly upbeat a n d l o o k i n g to t h e
future with only a f e w concerns for t h e
past. The b i g b a n d s o u n d p e r m e a t i n g
this track really works -1 think they should
explore it more. Your Most Valuable Pos-
session is ajazzy, stoned piece o f chilled
out s p e e c h . As far as I can tell, the lyrics
are a cautionary p h o n e piece f r o m a
relation o f s o m e kind. It's kind o f sweet
in an innocent way.
Weaker ones? Your Redneck Past is
a bit of a mixed b a g . It starts s o u n d i n g
very Beach Boys-Pet Sounds-ish but then
crashes about not really sorting itself
out. It lapses into French a n d then stut-
ters into a bit o f rap, e n d i n g up with
s o m e 303 beat action. Regrets is about,
well, regrets: 'All t h e days w a s t e d watch
TV, drinking beer', i never visited my
G r a n d m a even w h e n s h e w a s sick' a n d
T thought I'd d o s o m e travelling,' arc typ-
ical o f the song. It just feels a bit t o o bal-
lady for m y tastes, t h o u g h . Lullabye floats
a l o n g with s o m e h a n d c l a p p i n g a n d
James Earl J o n e s n a m e c h e c k s . It just
doesn't grab m e a l o n g t h e way.
Symptomatic o f the w h o l e a l b u m
really - while BFF's musical skills are never
in question, most of t h e tunes just did-
n't swing m e , apart from Army. W h e r e a s
previous BFF a l b u m s didn't give y o u a
chance to grab breath, this gives y o u t o o
m u c h t i m e to think about everything
else - apart f r o m the s o n g . That's not
what I have c o m e to expect from the five
- it's a c h a n g e that's all, w h i c h I a m not
sure is t h e right direction for t h e m . Pre-
vious fans might b e in for a little surprise
- they have m o v e d f r o m a m o r e punky
raw s o u n d perfectly d e m o n s t r a t e d in
their first a l b u m (the self titled Ben Folds
Five) to an altogether m o r e ballad based
t h e m e .
The q u e s t i o n r e m a i n s - c a n B e n
Folds Five ever regain t h e freshness a n d
brilliance o f their first offering? I h o p e so
- t h o u g h it's not g o i n g to h a p p e n with
this a l b u m , d
