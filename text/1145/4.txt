Prestigious College Gates
Dear Sir,
A large proportion o f us enters college
each day from Queen's Gate. W h e n atten-
tion isn't diverted to negotiating the exces-
sively marked pigeon territory surrounding
the side entrance gate, o n e cannot help
but notice t h e signs attached to the main
gates. The college is keen it appears to
point out that t h o s e perfectly suitable
main gates ate in fact temporary. But just
h o w 'temporary' are they? They w e r e pre-
sent w h e n I started U n i almost (gulp) 2
years a g o a n d will probably still b e there
w h e n I graduate in June 2000. So tell us
then, what's so amazingly special about
the original gates that justifies removal
for so long, - gold construction? Perhaps
the Felix archives hold photos o f what
must b e another c o m p o n e n t o f the col-
lege beautification program, a n d if so m a y
they reveal t h e m in all their glory...
Yours bewilderingly,
A n d r e w Vivian

Queen's Tower - an icon o f Imperial's orig-
inal gallant architectural composition that
once proudly stood before t h e twisted
architects of the 60s pulled it all d o w n . Vis-
ible from as far out as Richmond Hill the
m o n u m e n t serves to provide s o m e sort o f
history in otherwise grey, unfriendly sur-
roundings. M o r e or less however, IC stu-
dents ignore Q u e e n ' s Tower, - t h o s e
annoying kids that visits t h e m u s e u m s o f
Exhibition road pay it more attention (why
d o they c o m e a n d eat o n Q u e e n ' s
Lawn???) It is m y wish, a n d I believe right
(as a m e m b e r of this institution), to see the
surely admirably vie w of L o n d o n f r o m
such a height. Proposals such as entering
a biology team into that engineer's delight
'The great e g g race1
(which w a s met with
much amusement before w e withdrew o n
account that launching w o u l d only occur
from the lower balcony) d o not work, a n d
neither w o u l d t h e get-kicked-out-of-col-
lege option of trying one's luck at free-
climbing the masonry (not t o o sensible).
So if there's a n y o n e out there with a key
then email m e (asv97) a n d I'll bring s o m e

Dear Felix
'The Party o f the Year" - and w h o better to
share the night with than your loved one?
Well maybe not, if m y experiences are any-
thing to g o by.
All I wanted w a s 2 tickets for this w o n -
derful event - o n e for me, and o n e for m y
girlfriend. All ready to part with the princely
s u m of £110. But no. It seems that the
posters are lying (and I don't use that
w o r d loosely) or else the small print is
undetectable with an electron-microscope.
Although the object o f m y most lust-
ful desires Is indeed a student, albeit 300
miles away, she has to pay £65. Surely
s o m e mistake - as far as I'm aware she's
not staff/alumni. Perhaps she's entitled to
an office in Sherfield or an honourary
degree. Bargain, a n d all for an extra ten-
ner.
So basically it seems like we're dis-
criminated against if w e choose to g o out
with a n Arts student.
A refund o f w o u l d be nice, otherwise
I might have to start buying tickets under
a false identity.
Yours sincerely,

Housing the Truth
Dear Felix,
As a resident o f the house in question in
the a b o v e article ['Accomodation's
Adverse Advice' Felix 1143 & ' H o u s i n g
Office Stands Firm' Felix 1144] I thought I'd
give y o u 'my version' of the story. I agree
with t h e a c c o m m o d a t i o n office that last

week's article may have b e e n a little over
the top.
I believe that the prices advised by
Catherine John are correct. H o w e v e r I
believe that the landlady thought 'if I can
get 80 quid, w h y not 90?!' a n d initially
advised 90 quid as being the n e w rent.
However, a m e e t i n g between a resident
and the a c c o m m o d a t i o n office did take
place, although I don't k n o w w h o the stu-
dent I k n o w saw.
I believe that our landlady had a sec-
o n d meeting with s o m e o n e from IC a n d
THAT DAY t h e rent for next year w a s
advised as being 80 quid.
Personally I d o not feel aggrieved at
what the Private Housing Office has done.
They exist to provide impartial advice. Had
they advised a cheaper rent and the land-
lady then f o u n d that s h e w a s renting
cheaply then she w o u l d have the right to
feel aggrieved. Certainly o n e of the rea-
sons that I live there is because I thinkthat
w e get a very g o o d deal and if I w e r e the
landlord then I w o u l d charge 80 quid at
least.

Regulating the Internet
Dear Editor,
I w o u l d like to c o m m e n t o n your arti-
cle To Regulate or Not? [Felix 1143]. I also
disagree with the argument that "it must
be the kids w h o are screwed up". I agree
that "human are naturally inquisitive, espe-
cially w h e n y o u n g , a n d have a tendency
towards violence and moral wrong". Flow-
ever, let's get the perspective right. W e
have to realise the fact that the mass
m e d i a a n d computer g a m e s have great
impacts o n the society. A d v a n c e m e n t in
computer technology enables us to pro-
duce more realistic computer graphics,
which is useful for training doctors to prac-
tice surgery a n d in many other applica-
tions. However, a coin has t w o sides.
Whenever there is a n e w technology, peo-
ple tend to abuse it. Lack of regulations
could lead to serious problems. Computer
games like D o o m a n d Quake2 "allow" us
to "kill" people in the cruellest means for
no reason. After s o m e time, our brains are
"brainwashed" sub-consciously a n d w e
"think" that there is nothing w r o n g to hurt
another person. Moreover, the nature o f

films is getting more and more violent, and
high-resolution c o m p u t e r graphics
e n h a n c e t h e effects.
Let's get back to the point, the Inter-
net. The Internet is getting out o f control
because it gets very complex/complicated
too quickly. D u e to lack of laws in restrict-
ing contents allowed in Internet, people
abuse the technology and start putting up
pornography a n d violent materials. The
problem is that computer laws are differ-
ent in different countries. People can use
this "hole" to put up indecent webpages
in the servers of another country, if they
are not allowed to d o so in their country.
The major concern is that s o m e children
arc reading materials from the Internet
they should not be reading, like violent
and pornographic sites. As you have men-
tioned, p r o g r a m m e s like Internet Explorer
5 aren't effective e n o u g h to filter s o m e
sites.
We were grown up in a computer cul-
ture, so it takes shorter time for us to work
out h o w to use t h e computer a n d the
Internet. Parents don't s p e n d as m u c h
time o n the Internet as school kids.
Those violent video games and films
could ttigger the interests of y o u n g peo-
ple to look for violent w e b p a g e s because
they s e e m "normal" to them.
Internet has to b e regulated. It
requires international co-operation in set-
ting up standardised laws in regulating cer-
tain types o f information allowed in the
Internet. It is also feasible to have a m o n -
itoring organisation to monitor the infor-
mation contained in the Internet. The base
point is to protect children from reaching
those "unsuitable" sites. This can be done
by setting u p laws that require parents to
install software like Net Nanny. O n the
other hand, imposing too much control on
certain things in the Net could lead to
more negative effects. It will even encour-
age more people to look for "holes" in the
law to carry o n their "good work". Also, It
will cause inconvenience to people w h o
needs certain information for g o o d pur-
pose instead o f a b u s i n g t h e m .
Yours,
Lawrence Tse
