Whoop! Records - Collection: Two
Mixed by Nigel Dawson
(Whoop! Records)
A giant in the world of progressive
house in the UK, the Whoop! record
label has gone from strength to strength
in the last few years. Their early releases
included the seminal 'The Gate,' by
Dominion, and the first Tarrentella pro-
jects. In this their second discography the
label have employed stable favourite
Nigel Dawson (Renaissance resident and
the man behind Dominion), to mix the
best of their recent releases. Not sur-
prisingly the mix is dominated by three
huge Dominion cuts, and Tarrentella's lat-
est project. The first of these, Dominion's
'Outsider' is a dreamy, swirling melody of
quite epic proportions. One to really get
a smile on your face whilst dancing to its
progressive beats. And indeed it is this
type of sound which typifies this album.
Large carefree builders are everywhere,
linked together by some calm but funky
numbers. The mix lets you relax occa-
sionally but it never lets go. Just when
you think it might be beginning to tail off
it hits you with another monumental
track. The sort of record, like Ground
Zero's 'Fall Out' that just make you want
to forget everything and go clubbing
right now.
Orchestral sounds abound in a pre-
Millennial version of the early Renais-
sance sound. Nigel Dawson obviously
learnt a lot off Sasha and Digweed and
he uses it to full effect in this epic, but
bouncy mix. With genius tracks such as
Skynet UK's 'Open the Floodgates '99'
this album is one to watch out for.

Gatecrasher Red
Compilation
(INCredlble)
The best club in Britain produce a
fabulous mix compilation of the tunes
that have taken the Sheffield club to the
top of the club listings charts. The array of
songs is mindblowing - there are two CDs
each with over fifteen tracks and include
hits from Aurola, Ralf Fridge, Fatboy Slim,
Cevin Fisher and Humate. The full spec-
trum of music is covered - house, garage,
euro-house and epic/trance. The great
thing about this album is that it makes you
feel like you're actually there and what's
more, five randomly selected copies of the
album will have the Gatecrasher Golden
Ticket enclosed. The prize - free tickets to
the club for a year, a gameboy, CDs,
records and loads more goodies. Fucking
superb.

Pete Tong
'Essential Selection'
(flirt
'Oh no - it's all going a bit Pete Tong'.
The latest offering from the omnipresent
Pete Tong. Brilliant double CD album
mixed to perfection by Tong and includes
club hits from Pete Heller, Lucid, Hand's
Burn and many more. Each CD has fifteen
tracks and you get a nifty little
booklet/guide to the ten best club nights
in the UK. Excellent compilation but then
we'd expect that from Pete.

benchmark recordings, platforming artists

Their latest offering is the long-awaited sec-
ond compilation album. It has 11 tracks

Digweed. Artists featured on the album

dox and Mainline. A fabulous CD.

Revolution En La Casa
T h e Essential Latin House Collection'
(Nascante)
Rather poor collection of so called
Latin House. There's not much Latin to it
and the house is pretty dire. Crap.

Fuze Recordings Presents
'Beyond Voltage'
(Fuze)
Excellent drum and bass album. This
is a collection of Fuze Recordings finest
moments, beautifully mixed and features
artists such as Elementz, Noise, The
Vagrant, Embcc and The Spirit. This is a pre-
lude to Fuze's first full album excursion
entitled Twisted Soundscapes', and if it's
anything like this one then it's going to be
a cracker.

Underground Garage 2
(DCI)
The very best underground garage
tracks make up this double CD compilation
and the second in the series. Artists fea-
tured include Victor Romeo, Lenny
Fontana, Nu Klass A, Donna Dee and M&S.
These are the cream tracks of the under-
ground garage scene and the CD also fea-
tures many unreleased tunes. Smooth,
silky and very sexy.

Jump Up Drum ' N ' Bass
T h e Funk Hits The Fan'
(Street Beat Sound Collective)
Okay D&B album using the tunes
from the UK underground scene. It con-
tains tech step, hard step and funky breaks
from the UK's finest who have already
established themselves on the club circuit.
The tracklisting is impressive, but there
are better albums out there than this one
- and we've reviewed some of them on
this page!

DJs Psycho Bitch and Teri Bristol
'Chicago'
(Master Dance Tones)
Good mix compilation of hard house
tunes. The CD is expertly mixed by
Chicago's hardest working female DJs -
Psycho Bitch and Teri Bristol (nice names!).
This first CD mix captures the girls at their
hard house finest with a fierce selection
including tuff beats from DJ Sneak,
Auburn, Jan Driver and Amen UK. Some
excellent tunes on this all round top CD.

King Kooba
'Enter The Throne Room LP
(Second Skin)
King Kooba are unique artists who
fuse live instruments and sounds with the
latest studio technology to create some-
thing truly inspiring. Kooba's second album
has evolved taking their sound back to
their roots and influences spawning some-
thing more eclectic. This new album is a
magnificent piece of work and a first for
Kooba who have incorporated vocals into
the tracks for the very first time. But we're
not just talking about any old vocals here,
we arc talking about the likes of Ester
Philips on 'California Suite' and Melissa
Heathcoate on 'Koobesq', and Kooba's
vety own MCChickaboo on 'Fraternity'.
Everyone knows the old saying 'too many
cooks spoil the broth' and if you had seen
the list of people who helped make this
album you would think that it would be a
similar case with this album. No!! The
album is very well structerd and the range
of breakbeat and drum and bass is amaz-
ing. An excellent album.
