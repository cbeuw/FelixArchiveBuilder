Columns 1 7 May 1999
Sign of the Times
I
am not easily shocked. Aside from
snakes and Vanessa Feltz, few things
unnerve me. But a letter of agree-
ment from Ian Caldwell? Terrifying - the
poor bloke's in shock. As I have stated In
this column over the last four years, here
isa man of fine judgement, and his note
in last week's Felix confirms it, but enough
about me (boom boom!).
This whole sign thing has got com-
pletely out of hand, as Ian says. The ques-
tion is whether we really have to have all
these things stuck on the wall. Sadly,
pressures of work prevent me from
spending the morning wading through
Health & Safety Executive regulations,
but I have my doubts. Yes, most of this
rubbish originates from our beloved
friends in the European Commission, but
their already crazy directives tend to get
gold-plated by our civil servants, making
a bad job worse. Not a lot we can do
about that, but I have a nasty suspicion
that we interpret the rules too broadly,
resulting in the current farrago.
Personally, I am guided by Darwinism
in these situations. If someone is too stu-
pid to recognise a fire alarm without the
aid of this signage, let the flames con-
sume them, leaving us with a slightly less
polluted gene pool. Harsh but fair, I think
you'll agree. If we don't, where will it all
end? Why, we could end up with signs
indicating the temporary nature of gates...
Professional Advice?
I
wasn't being strictly honest. Another
thing that scares me a bit is female fig-
ures of authority at Imperial who are
fond of the word 'professional.' With that
in mind, I shall tread carefully over the Pri-
vate Housing Office incident. Apparently,
all this talk of £90 per
week is cobblers, the
true figure being a
suggestion of £75-80
dependent on room
size. So that's all
cleared up then? I
don't think so.
Given that the
above facts were pro-
vided by Mrs John,
there can be no fur-
ther dispute from her
standpoint.Therefore U p W i t h S l g n S i l l d i c a t
an employee of
imperial college, i n g t h e t e m p o r a r y
charged with assist-
ing students in their
quest for accommo-
dation, suggested that a landlady intend-
ing to rent to our students could get
away with a rise that far exceeded infla-
tion.
Call me naive, but I am at a loss to
see how this fits In with a 'remit...to look
after the Imperial students and find them
affordable accommodation.' When I was
an undergraduate, I most definitely could
not afford £80 per week, so I imagine that

cannot under-
stand how
C a t h e r i n e
John could
make such an

c o m m e n t ,
realising that
the only
p o s s i b l e
consequence
would be a
greater finan-
cial burden
for our stu-
dents a.k.a.
her clients.
She
states that she was responding to a
request for a 'professional opinion.' This
talk of professionalism is misguided. As
she says, her remit is the needs of stu-
dents, and that is her area of profes-
sional expertise. Offering suggestions to
private sector landlords about revenue
maximisation must surely constitute a
professional conflict of interests. I would
not seek to tell her how to do her job, but
this looks like a pretty obvious demarca-
tion line. The Private Housing Office
should not offer rent advice to landlords
beyond giving general information, the
provision of which would not be preju-
dicial to the Office's aim of serving our
students. And since,
as I gleaned from a
recent perusal of the
Residences trading
accounts, the Private
Housing Office is
funded out of the
income from student
rents, there seems lit-
tle scope for quibbling
with this view.
It is unfortunate
that time has been
wasted agreeing on
the facts, but it seems
fair to conclude that
the Private Housing
Office has behaved
badly in this case, the
statement of which gives me no pleasure
since I and many, many others have been
saying for years that we needed such a
service.
Simon Baker
or those of you eschewing dodgy
bedsits, preferring the majestic
splendour of Halls, there is much
change afoot.
Most of the
news about
big refurbish-
ment projects
has been
doing the
rounds for
some time.
The Southside
spruce-up, I'm
sorry 'concep-
tual design of
Halls of Resi-
dence and
student facili-
ties in Princes
Gardens', has
been on the
d r a w i n g
board for
almost three
years in its
current form,
and is obvi-
ously badly
n e e d e d .
Sadly, the huge delays in getting it sorted
out have allowed some morons at Eng-
lish Heritage to list it, despite it being one
of the ugliest buildings in West London,
thus precluding the preferred option of
demolition.
With that limitation, our friends in
Estates are going to have their work cut
out trying to make a silk purse out of an
enormous sow's ear. Anyway, it's good
to see a bit of progress. In the past,
things like this always seemed to fall
victim to the 'eyes bigger than your belly'
syndrome, as we accountants term it. It
is all fine and dandy coming up with a
great vision, but if it is beyond your
means tenfold, it
seems a fairly point-
less exercise. That
seems less likely in
this case now that
Estates have unveiled
their secret weapon,
the surplus sports-
ground.
This cunning
device is designed to
bring a bucketful of
cash, granting us our
every wish. This being
Imperial, it's not quite
that simple. Picking
which one(s) to close
is a purely political
and economic deci-
sion. No group of students will cause the
grief necessary to sway Sherfield, so
they will probably sell everything bar
Harlington; that should generate plenty
of cash, while preserving the College's
commitment to sport. Actually, that last
statement is rubbish. To preserve the
College, as opposed to Union, commit-
ment, we could have a fire sale and
ditch everything bar the Boathouse. No
problem so far, unless our medics get
their senior academics to be particularly
awkward.
The real problem is our track record.
IC is spectacularly unsuccessful at real-
ising maximum value from our assets.
Take Montpelier Hall in Knightsbridge. It
is worth a fortune, yet it was almost sold
for a mere couple of million. If we were
serious about making a killing, we
should be looking at joint ventures with
property developers. Not a new idea, it
has been considered by others at Col-
lege, but everyone seems to have come
to the same conclusions. Such is the
probability that we would make a dog's
breakfast of any such undertaking, no
one dare try it. There's confidence for
you.
Still, let's not be too negative. Any
'bonus cash' which lessens the chances
of the whole project being linked to
wildly optimistic conferencing proposals
is to be welcomed. Incidentally, what's
all this about 'non-academic areas must
break-even'? Has anyone told John fos-
ter, our redoubtable Head of Catering?
fast time I looked, that department,
aside from Southside Bar, was running
up debts more rapidly than the Duchess
of York. Surely it's not one rule for some
and one rule for others? Of course not.

nally, regular readers of this hum-
ble column will know that I am not
always bang up to date with my
film-going. The last man in Britain to
watch Pulp fiction and The Sound of
Music, I have only
just seen There's
Something About
Mary and Lock, Stock
and Two Smoking
Barrels. Not exactly of
the same genre, but
both stunningly
good: the former has
some moments of
exceptional slapstick
comedy, the latter is
just brilliant, taking
and developing the
very best elements of
British crime-related
film-making (The Ital-
ian Job and The Long
Good Friday, to name
but two). There must be someone out
there as slack as me in this respect, so
go out and rent them tonight. And why
not?
