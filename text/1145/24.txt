The biochemistry "derby" e n d e d in a
draw after a very eveniy fought g a m e .
U n d e r g r a d s started t h e m a t c h very
brightly, a n d had a g o l d e n opportunity
with virtually the first kick o f t h e g a m e ,
but the goalie s o m e h o w m a n a g e d t o
scramble back to save a certain goal b y
Daniel Myatt. Postgrads settled d o w n
quickly, a n d t h e first half w a s very evenly
contested. The postgrads t o o k t h e lead
w h e n D a n Lawton, f i n d i n g himself with
a bit of r o o m in t h e centre, u n l e a s h e d a
thunderous long range shot w h i c h p o w -
ered past the keeper. The pattern o f t h e
match never c h a n g e d t h o u g h , a n d both
t e a m s c o n t i n u e d t o press f o r g o a l .
U n d e r g r a d s e q u a l i s e d w h e n A n t o n y
Whittle caught t h e keeper off guard with
a snap shot. Almost immediately h o w -
ever, midfielder Richard Page h a d t o
come off with a pulled hamstring, a n d o n
the stroke o f half time, captain Jamil
Bacha w a s also injured.
The s e c o n d half picked u p pretty
m u c h w h e r e the first left off, with both
sides g o i n g for it. As time passed though,
the undergrads started to m o u n t i n g con-
sistent pressure o n t h e p o s t g r a d
d e f e n c e . They finally took the lead, with
Antony Whittle again catching the keeper
out with a shot from the e d g e o f the area
( s o m e w h e r e a r o u n d there anyway).
U n d e r g r a d s then had their best spell o f
the g a m e , putting together g o o d moves
a n d c o m i n g close t o increasing their
lead o n a c o u p l e of occasions.
However, o n o n e o f t h e postgrad
attacks, a shot took a deflection o f a n
undergrad defender, completely wrong-
f o o t i n g t h e keeper a n d giving t h e m a n
equaliser. Heads d r o p p e d briefly o n the
u n d e r g r a d side, a n d the last 10 minutes
w e r e o f intense pressure by postgrads,
w h o w e n t all out for a winner. Under-
grads also h a d a chance o f their o w n to
snatch it, but neither side m a n a g e d to
score in t h e time remaining, a n d t h e
result stayed as it w a s .

BUSA C h a m p i o n s h i p s (1st M a y 1999)
(MENS 2 n d VIII)
A n u n u s u a l l y c a l m a n d s u n n y d a y
greeted us early o n Saturday morning, at
H o l m e Pierrepont, t h e National Water
Sports Centre in N o t t i n g h a m . W e w e r e
entered in the C h a m p i o n s h i p Event, u p
against the first eights o f s o m e eigh-
t e e n or s o other institutions, despite
only b e i n g Imperial's s e c o n d boat. (Our
first boat had g o n e to a n International
Regatta in C o l o g n e for the w e e k e n d )
The format o f t h e day w a s to have
two qualifying heats in the afternoon,
and then a final in the e v e n i n g for t h e
six fastest crews. A l l races w e r e six
abreast, 2000m long, taking about six
minutes to race. C o m i n g third in the first
heat, a n d then a m u c h swifter s e c o n d in
the next round, proved to be m o r e than
e n o u g h t o earn us a place in the final.
O u r coxed four (which had never r o w e d
together as a crew before) also qualified
for their final, a n d c a m e sixth overall.
The last event o f the day w a s the eight's
final, a n d unfortunatelythe traditional
crosswinds associated with t h e course
appeared, a n d w e were drawn in choppy
lane 6. This m e a n t that even Cambridge,
racing in t h e stillness o f lane 1 beat us
by a canvas, despite the fact that w e had
given t h e m a g o o d s e e i n g to in both the
previous heats.
Nevertheless, after an epic row and brav-
ing t h e storm w e c a m e fifth, with only
four s e c o n d s separating us a n d s e c o n d
place. Still, fifth fastest university eight in
the country isn't b a d , considering w e
w e r e Imperial's s e c o n d boat, a n d had
our first r o w as a crew for a w e e k before
the final. It w a s O x f o r d Brookes w h o
s t o r m e d to victory, w i n n i n g by over t e n
s e c o n d s , but then they're not exactly
s e c o n d in t h e L e a g u e Tables, are they?
