Lennie De Ice
W e Are I.E.'
(Distinctive)
Another strong release from one of
the most reliable labels in the business.
But it certainly doesn't come to us with-
out a few ever-so-common problems.
You see, this is one of those annoying
releases where the original radio edit
really isn't up to standard, and so you are
forced to search through the other mixes
for some gems. Now this in itself isn't
such a bad thing to have to do, but what
it means is that the record may not do
as well as it deserves to, because of the
throw-away radio edit that is put forward
to receive air play. In this case, the radio
edit is a tedious groovy dub, which is
pretty unmemorable, whilst the remixes
take the sluggish base line and give it a
good kick up the arse. This increase in
tempo then gives us a couple of blind-
ing, stomping house tracks, in the form
of the Johan S Toxic Mix and the Bullet-
proof Underground Mix. Very much like
some of the stuff the Natural Born
Grooves people may come out with. Try
it out for size before buying.

Mondo Paradiso
Whale Nation'
(Opaque Stereo)
More great dreamy beats and breaks
from the M o n d o Paradiso team. Follow-
ing up the critical success of their debut
'Mezza Luna,' this track, in all its guises,
delivers a funky feel to the music, while
still remaining distinctly "out there." The
second mix would fit seamlessly into
any of the Northern Exposure mixes,
whilst the original is a jazzy D&B excur-
sion of some style (even if it does
become a bit James Bond). Worth a lis-
ten to.

The Strike Boys
'Jet Set'
(Wall of Sound)
The German phunksters return with a
cut from their critically acclaimed debut
album, 'Selected Funks.' The original mix
is a laid-back slice of electronic funk with
a dreamy, atmospheric feel to it. Simulta-
neously pleasing on the ear and mind. The
remixes come courtesy of the French acid
heads the Micronauts, and Nu Skool expo-
nents Buckfunk 3000. Both of these ver-
sions can stand alone in their own right,
making this release one to look out for.

Trash Compactor
'AntI Disco EP'
(Boscaland)
Here's a simple recipe to give your-
self one of the worst migraines that you
have ever experienced. First, bang your
head against a wall in anticipation of
how bad this track is going to be. Sec-
ond, listen to the aforementioned piece
of music (!) Third, bang your head against
the wall a little more when you realise
just how bad it really is, that you could
do so much better, and how on earth
does this sort of stuff ever get released
(moan, moan, moan). Remedy = lots of
aspirin and dropping this record into a
trash compactor (or a waste-disposal
unit, as we English people say).

Pete Heller
'Big Love'
(ffir)
Top single from one of the top
jocks/producers on the scene. Big Love
is a top house number with a tune
dancefloors are just screaming out for.
We only got one mix of it, but that was
superb so I guess the rest of the mixes
must be too.

Joy
'Just Round'
(Posltlva)
A very cheesy tune ready made for
the summer. Catchy party beats and
addictive vocals, the single samples Ste-
vie Wonder's 'Uptight' and the result is
an irritating and cheesy tune that will be
a hit on the dancefloors in Spain/Greece
etc.
Out soon

DJ Sakin & Friends
'Nomansland'
(Posltlva)
The epic house DJ/producer comes
up with the goods again. Sampling the
theme tune to a popular show in the
70's, the single is a trip through epic
house. Dreamy vocals and deep beats
make this a monster choon.
Out next week

Raphael Saadlq & Q-Tip
'Get Involved'
(edel)
A very smooth, soulful and sensual sin-
gle which is massive on the R&B scene.
The track is taken from the hugely rated
show the PJs on Fox TV, and features silky
vocals from Raphael and a melodic beat.
Sure to be a hit.
Out next week
Tom Harding vs Jon the Dentist
'1988'
(Phoenix Uprising)
Jon the Dentist (of Baby Doc and the
Dentist fame) teams up with Bristol-
based DJ Tom Harding to bring us this
jumpin' hard house number. The track
blends Old School Acid sounds with
some breakbeats and a large hard house
beat. Both sides are worth a listen, but
it is the A-side that shines through, deliv-
ering us a great breakdown and an uplift-
ing bouncy house tune. Guaranteed to
get any dancefloor going.

David Elkabas &Tom Dlnsdale
Things We Used To Do'
(Milk 'n'2 Sugars Recordings)
The debut release from this recent
extension of the funky London monthly,
which has just moved venues from The
Cross to Bar Rumba. To be honest having
gone to M'n'2S and enjoyed it immensely,
I'm slightly disappointed with the stan-
dard of the Original Mixes on the A-side.
This is funk-house that simply never gets
off the ground, and that is precisely what
you don't find at the club night itself.
There always seems a point to what gets
played at the venue, and this is where
these mixes fail to capture the essence of
the club. This is surprising because one of
the production team mentioned above is
a resident at the night. However, all is not
lost, because where the M'n'2S people
have done wonders is in getting New
York's legendary DJ Disciple to remix the
track. His Slam Jam Remix is, as you would
expect, a monumental disco-funk number,
and does precisely what the original fails
to do. Just listening to the remix is like
being back at the night, grooving to classy
house music in lush venues. Give this
one a go, and expect lots more groovy
releases to flow from this new label.

Lectrolux
'Gimme A K'
(Tec F)
This track, originally thought up as
part of the FCUK ad campaign, uses the
main sample from the Woodstock festival
in the year in which it is set to return to
America (after a thirty-year absence). I'm
sure you can guess at what the letters are
that the announcer asks the crowd to
shout - bloody rude, aren't they? But does
a rude word make the record any good?
Well, not really. The A-side mix, is a plod-
ding big-beat affair which probably could
wangle its way into a very very long Fatboy
Slim set, but certainly wouldn't be one of
the highlights. Ihe AA-side is a tad better,
giving a solid hard house remix. How-
ever, once again, this would be a song to
pad out a set with, rather than one to
make the crowd wet themselves over.
Out May 31st.
Wayne G presents Twisted featuring Stew-
art Who?
'Breakdance (Is Back)'
(It's Fabulous Records)
A curious little single, available as two dif-
ferent vinyl releases. On one you get the
housicr mixes, the first of which is Grip's
Heaven Dub - a funky number, which
uses an 80s sample that I can't quite put
my finger on. Well worth a listen, as is
Trade DJ Alan Thompson's Disco Dub. But
the killer track on this record is Heaven res-
ident Wayne G's imaginatively titled
5AM@Heaven Mix. It builds up nicely into
being one of those house tunes that can
somehow be bangin1
and groovy at the
same time.
The second record, however is my
favourite. The three tracks on it are com-
pletely different to each other - a refresh-
ing change in a time when artists feel as
if they can get away with sticking carbon-
copy, throw-away mixes on the B-sides of
only half-decent tunes. What you get here
is a strong AA-side track, 'Debauchery' - a
nice stomping, bouncing up-beat house
tune, which D.A.V.E. the Drummer had a
hand in, followed by two mixes of the title
track on the A-side. Easily the most fun of
these is the Original Mix, which relies
heavily on 80s samples (including the old
theme tune from Grange Hill), and some
amusing spoken lyrics. Doesn't sound too
great from that description, but believe me
it does work.

Plpl Le Oul
l e Funky Bus/I Dunno'
(Disques Bleu)
Freshly cut disco house from the gor-
geously green plains of southern France,
delivered to us, toll free apparently, in
Pipi's own Citroen bus. Now forget about
the AA-side, i Dunno.' On listening to this
tepid excuse for a house tune, it appears
that Pipi really doesn't know very much.
Well, not about how to make disco house
anyway. But wait, listen to the A-side and
just stop yourself from dancing. The start
is pretty standard, but after the first break-
down the sample of De La Soul's M e ,
Myself, and I' kicks in, and from there the
track goes ballistic. A great example of
disco house, sure to be caned to death at
nights like Carwash. Most funky.
