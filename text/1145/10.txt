Forces of Nature * * *
Starring : Sandra Bullock, Ben Affleck, Steve Zahn, Maura Tierney
Director: Bronwen Hughes
I
arrived at the c i n e m a in a less than
h o p e f u l m o o d . Posters a n d trailers
for Forces of Nature h a d led m e t o
believe that this w a s to b e a n o surpris-
es, n o laughs, no-thinking-required
romance, in traditionally generic Sandra
Bullock style. Consequently, I w a s pleas-
antly surprised b y t h e m o v i e that flick-
ered up o n t o the screen in front o f m e .
OK, so it's still far from perfect (the cast-
ing's o d d , the r o m a n c e is stilted a n d t h e
plot twists are predictable) but it's enter-
taining e n o u g h t o keep y o u a n d your
plus o n e a m u s e d , n o n e t h e l e s s (like
most romantic c o m e d i e s , this is t h e ter-
ritory o f early dates a n d sad romantics).
I n d e e d , t h e r e ' s d e f i n i t e signs o f
potential here, a n d Forces of Nature
could actually b e a really g o o d m o v i e if
it wasn't for the strange casting deci-
sions clearly m a d e by lazy execs l o o k i n g
for easy bankabillty. The script calls for
our t w o protagonists to b e o f the oppo-
sites-attract variety: she's a wild-child -
twice married, t e e n a g e mother, exotic
dancer, lives for kicks, can c o n her w a y
out o f a n y situation e t c e t c etc; h e ' s
straight-laced a n d down-to earth -

Ah yes - It's the Industry standard runnlng-through-the-raln sequence.
ding), career m i n d e d , plays u p the odds
in every situation blah blah blah. A n d
w h o ' s cast in these disparate roles? San-
dra Bullock a n d Ben Affleck. Huh? Thir-
t y s o m e t h i n g girl next d o o r type Bullock
is mid-twenlics rebel, whilst hunk-of-the-
m o m e n t Affleck is called u p o n to act
like a plank - surely s o m e mistake? Well
yes, it clearly is, because, apart from their
real-life a g e g a p (just shy o f ten years),
the roles simply don't reflect w h a t they
d o best, a n d thus a pair o f charismatic
actors a r e left t r e a d i n g water a r o u n d
e a c h other o n screen.
That aside, h o w e v e r , t h e p r o d u c -
tion follows t h e current trend toward
three-minute M T V style s e g m e n t s , with
s o m e nice soundtrack picks overlaid with
Sandy-and-Ben r u n n i n g in t h e rain in
slow-mo, w e a v i n g t h r o u g h traffic, play-
ing o n t h e roof o f their train a n d so-on.
It's t h e kind o f directing that's currently
taking a lot o f flack f r o m critics, but it
actually m a k e s f o r a f u n (albeit bitty)
m o v i e - after all, this is hardly s u p p o s e d
to b e high-art.
If all that s o u n d s t o o negative, then
don't discard Forces of Natureyel - it's
a decent m o v i e n o n e t h e l e s s . Whilst not
particularly e n g a g i n g as a romantic cou-
ple, Affleck a n d Bullock's adventures are
distracting a n d diverse e n o u g h t o pro-
v i d e a b r e a k f r o m t h e usual action/
r o m a n c e d i v i d e . Ignore t h e casting,
enjoy t h e soundtrack, accept the pre-
dictable c h e e s i n e s s o f the w h o l e thing,
a n d relax...and don't say I didn't warn
y o u . Q

The Idiots * * * *
Starring : Bordil Jorgenson, Jens Albinus, Anne Louise Hassing
Director: Lars Von Trier
Its grainy; Its weird; It's got lots of nudity - It must be Danish
F
o l l o w i n g o n f r o m T h o m a s
Vinterberg's The Celebration
(released last month), The Idiots is
the latest movie to e m i n a t e f r o m t h e
back-to-basics r e n a i s s a n c e currently
d o m i n a t i n g Danish c i n e m a . T h e current
v o g u e (much talked about in arty film
circles across Europe) is t h e result o f t h e
D o g m a 95 Collective - a g r o u p o f four
prominent Danish directors w h o have
signed what they describe as a ' V o w o f
Chastity' t o govern h o w they p r o d u c e
their work. The a g r e e m e n t bars t h e m
from using soundtrack music, lighting,
excessive action or bulky cameras - a n d
consequently, all D o g m a movies must
be entirely shot o n location, with h a n d -
held cameras. Q u i t e clearly, grainy a n d
low budget is the order o f the day.
Surprisingly (considering the decla-
ration is really just o n e b i g gimmick) the
films p r o d u c e d by t h e directors c o n -
c e r n e d have b e e n a l m o s t universally
praised - a n d The Idiots is n o exception.
Although it may have attracted m o r e pub-
licity f o r t h e trouble s u r r o u n d i n g its
release (the BBFC w e r e initially unwilling
to grant a certificate to a movie contain-
ing an uncensored group orgy), V o n Trier
really deserves massive recognition for his
ability to tell such a compelling story with
such backward technology-just imagine
Steven Speilberg trying to make his next
movie with $20 000 a n d a H a n d i c a m .
Like the style, the story itself could easily
be accused o f deliberately seeking pub-
licity, as w e f o l l o w a g r o u p o f (very
strange) middle class Danes w h o (for no
readily apparent reason) entertain t h e m -
selves by pretending to be mentally hand-
icapped. Obviously, it's all a metaphor for
relaxing your inhibitions a n d expressing
your real e m o t i o n s , but whilst it starts
out as merely amusing, it rapidly becomes
by turns haunting, frenzied a n d heartfelt.
Despite t h e total i n c o m p r e h e n s i b i l -
ity of m u c h o f t h e story (you'll constantly
be trying to w o r k out what w a s g o i n g on
in t h e previous scene), w a t c h i n g The
Idiots is a p r o f o u n d l y affecting experi-
ence. D o g m a 95 certainly isn't the future
of H o l l y w o o d (whatever the critics say,
budgets a n d t e c h n o l o g y will continue to
spiral until c i n e m a is finally overtaken by
the next mass m e d i u m ) , but in certain
specific cases - a n d for certain specific
directors - it's a brilliant w a y to tell a
story in a poignant, incredibly personal,
