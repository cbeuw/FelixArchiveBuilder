the elaboration of styles passed through
generations of artists w h o s e fathers had

with that of the native artists.
After M a h a r a j a Ranjit Singh there

MAYDAY

S
he is talking loudly in a darkened
room. S o m e people stop to listen for
a f e w s e c o n d s before consulting
their watches impatiently. O n l y o n e m a n
seems deeply interested, and he no doubt
makes a mental note to tell his wife w h e n
he visits her in jail. Elsewhere, an elderly
man is s l u m p e d in front of a TV, watching
a film about the e n d of the World. A n d in
the corner, three students are surfing the
Net while their friends e x a m i n e a p h o t o -
graph of a public execution.
All this in MayDay, the current exhi-
bition at the P h o t o g r a p h e r s ' Gallery in
Great N e w p o r t Street. This is an excit-
ing exhibition b e c a u s e its central t h e m e
is transmitted s o effectively t h r o u g h
multimedia. A n d appropriately e n o u g h ,
the t h e m e is m e d i a c o m m u n i c a t i o n -
h o w w e use it a n d h o w t h e y use it
against us.
The Photographers' Gallery w o u l d
probably say that all this captures the Zeit-
geist (to you a n d m e , the spirit o f the
age). I guess it does, given our current
and past fixation with m e d i a intrusion
into the lives of the rich a n d f a m o u s .
But h o w d o e s the m e d i a use us, the
ordinary people? films of students rioting
in Paris in 1968 are juxtaposed with films
of m o d e r n riots. All riots l o o k m u c h the
s a m e a n d the m e d i a have always loved
reporting t h e m . Massive m o n o c h r o m e
m u g s h o t s o f G u l a g survivors break u p
the flow. A n d postcards depicting exe-
cutions a n d coffins sit u n c o m f o r t a b l y
with pictures of G a p bags - w e are con-
trolled by G o v e r n m e n t and by Corpora-
tions a n d they both use the mass m e d i a
against us. five-year plans versus buy,
buy, buy.
The obvious but well expressed mes-
sage is: apocalypse now, a n d tomorrow,
and forever and ever. But don't think a pall
of g l o o m hangs over the entire exhibition.
The walls are painted in bright yellows,
reds a n d oranges. O n e side of the r o o m
is given over to an arts project w h i c h has
e n c o u r a g e d kids from Brixton, Nairobi,
Cape Town and D h a k a to take photos of
their (often extraordinary) everyday lives.
All the photos are a c c o m p a n i e d by touch-
ing captions, written, often in broken Eng-
lish, by the kids themselves. Even if the
cynical m e d i a is destroying our lives today,
maybe these a m a z i n g children will have
the strength t o m a k e the World better
tomorrow. Tragically, maybe they won't.
This is less a p h o t o g r a p h y exhibition
a n d m o r e an 'infotainment' experience
w h e r e you can sit o n a c o m f y chair, read
a book, surf the Internet, or even have
a cup of m e d i o c r e espresso in the o h so
trying hard to be trendy cafe attached to
the Gallery.
But w h a t of the girl talking loudly in
a darkened room? In reality, she is stand-
ing o n a s o a p box at Speaker's Corner.
She has b e e n captured o n film, and w e
are w a t c h i n g her o n TV. A n d w h a t is she
s p e a k i n g in public about? H o w to speak
well in public, o f course. Isn't it all s o
ironic?
