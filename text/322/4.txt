Letter from
America
Cambridge,
New York State,
U.S.A.
Sir,—This letter, as your
overwhelming perception will
already have noted, is com-
ing to you from the frenetic
precincts of the U.S.A.,'
known to its residents as
America or the most power-
ful country in the World.
Both these statements are,
of course, open to the de-
bate that their inherent dis-
crepancies cause; however,
being subject myself to a
similar kind of paranoia as
permeates the land, I find
myself temporarily lodged
within its somewhat grossly
mapped confines. Being also,
as many within your institu-
tion can verify, somewhat
americanized in style, I am
also forced into a position
of believing fervently in the
maxim, "when in Rome do as
Rome does".
Which leads obviously,
when residing with an Ameri-
can family in a small town in
New England, to passing the
evenings lounging in gracious
harmony in the sitting room,
glued unrelentlessly to the
television. Within this parti-
cularly remarkable little in-
strument reside some quite
amazing characters. Aside
from their remarkable ability
to be green one day and
purple the next, their extreme
tenacity in the face of con-
tinued odds, which inci-
dentally would put any ordi-
nary 22 inch tall person out
of action in less than no
time, remain incredible feats
of endurance to my meagre
human eyes. Aside from
these superb qualities, and
many others unmentioned,
there exists a kind of eleva-
ted status amongst these
mass-produced mini-people,
raising them above us ordi-
nary whelks, in our ordinary
view, of course.
Take Mark Spitz, for ex-
ample. His handsome face
graces the screen with mon-
otonous regularity, enthusing
over himself in various pro-
ducts which he uses; in-
cluding approximately four
makes of aftershave and
cologne, which has led to
our presumptuously cynical
supposition that he must
swim in the stuff. Another
chap who appears, less regu-
larly, is a sugar-tongued
Californian with a genius for
saying nothing in more than
a thousand words, known as
Richard Nixon. We are told
that he has a second job
which has something to do
with running the corruptry;
sorry, that should be coun-
try.
Another character who
we are here rather fond of is
a chap who works. for the
Los Angeles police depart-
ment (turn left at the drap-
ery department) known as
Joe Colombo, Colombo to
his friends. And he's just
been on! Brightening up our
Sunday evening was an NBC
mystery movie special with
Colombo helping good old
New Scotland Yard solve a
murder. It was a pretty
funny show, with ; Colpmbo
being the archetypal, 'over-
zealous, camera - hugging,
brash, sleazy American tour-
ist every Briton loves to hate,
whilst, as an incident, sol-
ving the murder'. It was sol:
ved, and this brings us close
to the point, in the London
Wax Museum. i
Having already passed an
enjoyable two hours pointing
out the landmarks to the
locals here (happiness is be-
ing the centre of attention)
the picture changed after a
message from Big Wally
about a paint -and the scene
was the London Wax Mu-
seum. There follows the text
of a conversation between
Will, 14-year-old son of the
family, and Ian, occasional
family appendage (that's
me)'-
Will: "We went there,
didnt we?" i ;
Ian: "Hell, no. You went
to Madame Tussaud's"•
Will: "So Where's that?"
Ian: "On Baker Street".
Will: "Jeez, are you ever
dumb. I meant where's the
London Wax Museum, stup-
id!?"
Ian adopts musing pose,
ruminating simultaneously
over the despicable quality
of Will's vocabulary, and the
vaguely familiar bastion
housing the London Wax
Museum. Then laughs.
Ian: "Good grief! They
finally found a decent use
for it".
Will: "For what?"
Ian: "The London Wax
Museum".
Will: . "You said there
wasn't a London Wax Mu-
seum".
Ian: "That's what I said, I
hope there is now".
Will: "Why don't you ever
talk sense?"
Ian: "Listen, peasant. That
building with London Wax
Museum written on it—
/ went to college there."
Will: (cracking up): "You
What? (helpless giggles).
You went to College?"
Ian (with a feeble attempt
at firmness): "Yes I did. For
seven weeks I attended the
Imperial College, London".
I did and am proud of it.
And so the purpose of this
letter is to wish everybody
well, for it was a warm
feeling seeing Prince Con-,
sort Road again. Hope there's
not still as much horniness
as when I was there, bad for
the soul, don't you know.
Maybe a little less logic
would come in handy too.
Greetings to Mr. Cory and
the dude on the sixth floor of
Elec Eng with the pretty
wife, the glasses, and the
name I remember as being
unforgettable but ' can't re-
member; Phil, George, John
Harding et al.
Love,
IAN STOCK.
P.S. Pardon this stupidity,
but if Theresa had called it
wouldn't have been neces-
sary.
Readers' Letters
In defence
of NUS ,
Sir,—Ross McBeath ob-
viously did not enjoy what
was presumably his first NUS
Conference. . Most of the
other IC students who were
in Margate disagree entirely
with his report on this con-
ference.
Conference was not just
a fight between the Commun-
ist Party and the Trotskyists
as he states. Unlike at pre-
vious conferences, at this
conference the Trotskyists
were very little in evidence
and where they did put their
line it was generally over-
whelmingly rejected. The
main opposition to the exec
utive on the grants motion,
for example, came from col-
leges such as UCL, IC,
Whitelands and Sussex, who
were rejecting the Exec's
vague and limited demands
and instead putting forward
clear demands which were
more likely to initiate a suc-
cessful campaign on grants
which is what all students
want. In proposing that we
fight for abolition of the
means test we were attempt-
ing to get the NUS Exec to
accept an aim that most stu-
dents have already agreed to
so that in this case the CP
was being reactionary. (For a
fuller report on this see
CEFE No. 8).
Ross McBeath complains
that the main motions were
always passed, and says this
was because the delegates
had actually forgotten what
they were. Maybe he, as
press officer, was not paying
proper attention but the dele-
gates were perfectly well
aware of what the main
motion was.
Main motions are often
passed because of the way
they are put together: In the
compositing session which
takes place before the de-
bate in conference, all the
colleges which have submit-
ted motions on a particular
subject (and with subjects
such as autonomy, grants,
there are very many) t^?t to-
gether and form one main
motion with several amend-
ments. Thus a main motion
is an amalgam of the ideas
of many people, is not very
controversial and is bound
to get a lot of support. This
is very necessary because if
main motions were very con-
troversial they would often
be rejected and NUS policy
would never be updated.
This also results in greater
democracy as much of policy
is decided at college level—
in the submitting of main
motions.
In future things will be
even more democratic due
to a motion passed in Con-
ference Reform putting the
date of the November con-
ference two weeks later so
that motions no longer have
to be submitted before the
beginning of the Autumn
term — a very useful re-
form which Ross McBeath
did not mention when con-
demning the previous system.
Any student has the right
to submit a motion for NUS
Conference at a UGM in his
college and if your union
agrees with it, it goes for-
ward to NUS. Thus you are
perfectly at liberty to put in
some nice reactionary mo-
tions such as "let's all have
a decrease in grants or a
loans system, let's have
Maggie Thatcher controlling
everything the unions do,
let's pay higher hall fees,
etc.". If your union has a
large right wing element as
R. McBeath seems to think
there is, then such motions
will get passed and go to
conference. Would it be too
much to say that this does
not happen because students
do not in general agree with
such proposals?
As for the delegates to
conference, one cannot get
away from the fact that they
are elected. If our union
elects Piers Corbyn to go to
NUS, it means that our
union wants to be represent-
ed by Piers Corbyn. If Tory
students want Tory dele-
gates they can elect them.
Finally R. McBeath denies
that students have any power
to achieve their aims. This
is the argument continually
put forward by the Trotsky-
ists and is an excuse for not
doing anything more than
generally supporting workers'
struggles. A "national stud-
ent strike" cannot be com-
pared (as he does) with a
TUC General Strike, in the
same way as a strike by
just postmen (say) cannot be
compared with a general
strike of all workers. It is
true to say that students do
not have the same economic
power as other workers in
that simply not attending lec-
tures does not have the same
effect as electricity workers
not turning up to work. But
even boycott of lectures has
been used successfully in
some colleges to achieve cer-
tain aims, particularly in dis-
putes within colleges or de-
partments rather than on a
national scale. One does not
have the power to bring the
country to a halt in order to
achieve anything; a strike of
teachers, cleaners, television
workers and many others
does not bring the country
to a halt but this does not
prevent them from using this
tactic successfully. Students
can and must use the power
they have to the best they
can. Rather than withdraw-
ing their labour, students
have more power to withdraw
their money, i.e. to not pay
rent or high prices in refec-
tories, etc. If this is properly
organised nationally with
students in each college tak-
ing the action most suitable
to their situation, we will
have an effect on the govern-
ment. Recently students have
had an important effect in
forcing the government to
withdraw its proposals to
cut union autonomy. R. Mc-
Beath simply "does not in-
clude this". Students in
individual colleges have had
successes by using the pow-
er they have. If you just do
not include the successes,
but only look at everything
else then you are bound to
come to the conclusion that
students have no power but
this simply becomes ridicu-
lous.
It is through NUS that
national campaigns can best
be organised. NUS is our
national union and as such
is very relevant. Of course
some people in any situation
like to sit back and watch
others fight for them and
then reap the benqfits. I
don't. Of course NUS has its
faults but it is up to us to
remedy them rather than
withdraw and make NUS
even less effective.
Felix should certainly in-
clude personal minority opin-
ions but not as the main
news report on something as
important as NUS Confer-
ence. Students who were not
there should have the oppor-
tunity to judge for them-
selves rather than be present-
ed with a set of arguments
in favour of leaving NUS.
Yours sincerely,
SON!A HOCHFELDER.
Jews-
more
confusion
Sir,—In reply to Sonia
Hochfelder's letter, subtitled
"Jews, Jowitt and Jeneralisa-
tions", I think we both
missed slightly the point of
your article and my letter.
If I conveyed the opinion
that I accused you of saying
the Israeli Government was
involved directly with the
Munich Olympics, then I am
sorry. My letter was aimed
at trying to establish why the
Jews appear to have been
persecuted for as long as
history records. I did not
state that your facts were
unsubstantiated, although I
can and do doubt their val-
idity.
I refute the accusations
that my letter was an attempt
to show off my knowledge of
ancient history, and that I
accused the author of the
CEFE article (Sonia) of be-
ing a supporter of the Black
September Movement. / am
glad to hear that Sonia does
not support the terrorist acti-
vity, although as an effective
organisation it takes some
beating. My letter did how-
ever promote some interest-
ing discussion (not only
through the columns of
"Felix", but in conversation
too). I thank Sonia for clari-
fying the CEFE article, but
the question of the pro-
longed history of the perse-
cution of the Jews still re-
mains unanswered. "Next
time, please, Sonia, read the
article before criticising it".
Thank you for the interesting
points.
Yours T.T.C.C.H.,
PAUL JEW ITT.
• The FELIX abbreviations
expert is now convinced that
"T.T.C.C.H." has a more
sinister meaning than "Tilt
the cows come home". Sug-
gestions welcomed.
Sir,—/ would like to reply
to the letters from G. IV.
Foot in the last issue of
"Felix", but I have to write
articles for Felix — so I
haven't got time.
Regards,
DAVID HOBMAN.
