Action called for
against Southside
job security threat
Only fifteen people turned up to Thursday's SocSoc meeting where
Brian Grogan (of Red Mole) talked about the Wage Freeze and two
National Union of Public Employees (NUPE) shop stewards talked
about the job security threat to Southside cleaners.
Two shop stewards of freeze was through united belief that thefirstneces
workers' action while they
NUPE, who work as Mes-
sengers in the College,
spoke on the administra-
tion's plan to reduce the
cleaning staff in Southside
through "natural wast-
age". Andy O'Brien, Elec-
trical Engineering messen-
ger said that both the
workers and the students
must support the struggle
against this happening,
and said that NUPE staff
other than cleaners were
prepared to take industri-
al ar»ion should the Col-
lege proceed with this
plan.
It was explained that
the College, through its
Domestic Bursar, Mr.
Carl Seaford, was putting
forward the plan to re-
duce cleaning staff in an
attempt to maintain the
profit ratio on Halls of
Residence, and to keep
rents down. Andy O'Brien
said that the College
claimed that wages took
67 per cent of total hall re-
venue; the college would
prefer them to only take
33 per cent like the stu-
dent houses in Evelyn
Gardens. He pointed out
that the standard of clean-
ing was also correspond-
ingly different, and asked
the meeting whether it
thought it preferable that
the cleanliness of halls be
reduced.
He and Ron Parker,
Beit messenger, stressed
the importance of a joint
workers and students
struggle.
(More detailed discus-
sion of the problem ap-
pears in CEFE's "Opin-
ion" column on page 9 of
this issue).
Before this, the meeting
had listened to a speech
by Brian Grogan.
Mr. Grogan concentra-
ted his talk on the "Crisis
of Capitalism" in view of
"the falling profits since
1962". He said that this
crisis had thrown the rul-.
ing class into confusion,
and they were trying to
re-unite themselves, both
Tory and Labour Party
capitalists, through the
wage freeze. Citing what
he called an attempt to
demoralise the working
class through the unem-
ployment problem, he
said that the working class
had never been more un-
ited and more self-confid-
ent — the reverse of what
the government wanted
had happened.
In his view, the only
way to get rid of the wage

are still in this strong and
united position.
He went on to a de-
tailed discussion of the
relative policies of the
Communist Party, and the
-International M a r x i s t
Group on the overthrow
of capitalism. An Inter-
national Marxist himself,
he attacked the CP's
sity was the defeat of
the Tories. He was also
adamant that a campaign
for "Labour Government
committed to Socialist
policies" as put forward
by workers press was to-
tally useless. His lengthy
discourse on the latter
degenerated into a fierce
dialogue with a member
of another faction.
The main message agreed upon at Thurs-
day's meeting was that there should be a hall
rents strike for higher grants and against cut-
backs in cleaners' jobs.
The proposed rent strike would
demands:
have four
1) £100 increase in the grant now
2) No cut-back in cleaners' jobs.
3) No rent increases
4) The DES must pay for all future halls.
The subject of rent strikes will be taken to
the first U G M of next term, and the meeting
called upon students not to pay their hall bills
until then.
We have 900
lone girls here"
That's the message of a letter from the Hampstead
Garden Suburb Institute asking for virile young men
to attend their dance on Saturday, December 16. The
price is dirt cheap — 30p — and in their words they
would "be delighted to see as marry men as possible".
Paul Wadsworth, I.C. Ents magnate, has got some
tickets for sale, and can be found invariably in the
Union office at mnchtimes. The price includes Disco,
wine, food and G A M E S (!!??).
STIRLING LATEST
The first student to appear before the discipline
committu; was found guilty of "Conduct prejudicial to
the good order and interests of the University by ob-
taining entry to a reception at the MacRobert Centre
without having been invited".
He is appealing against the verdict.
The nature of the committee is best described by
Mr. George More, the Solicitor representing the stu-
dents. He describes the committee as "unbelievably
biased". Furthermore Mr. More stated "Every defence
objection was over-ruled, every prosecution objection
was upheld and I was not allowed to call all the wit-
nesses whose evidence I thought would be relevant."
The cases are likely to go on for many weeks, per-
haps months. 23 more students including 15 council
members were charged and the authorities are de-
manding expulsions.

clothing, shoes and blankets, but cigarettes, etc. would also be appreciated.
Each dosser will be given a small parcel containing various items depending
on the amount of articles collected. A number of items of clothing collected
will be kept for distribution on the Community Action soup run.
OLD FOLK
Community Action is hoping to hold a party on Christmas Day for some of the
old people in Notting Hill we had contact with last year. Food and presents

ALL GIFTS HOWEVER SMALL, WILL BE APPRECIATED
Many thanks
Record Service in l.C.
Records cost such a
fantastic amount that the
student has difficulty in
affording the prices that
are charged for records.
To counteract this the
Sounds Service in IC is
being operated so that stu-
dents may buy records at
10—15 per cent off the
recommended retail price.
This means that a record
that normally sells for
£2.30 costs the student
£1.91 and £2.50 records
cost £2.05.
To take advantage of
this great cost-cutting ser-
vice, just drop in and see
Colin McCall or one of
the other people on the
Sounds Service stall in the
J.C.R., College Block,
during lunch break on
Tuesday, Thursday, or
Friday every week until
the Union Room-at-the-
top is ready.
Orders may also be for-
warded through the inter-
nal mail to Colin MoCall,
ELEC, ENG 2 . . .
The records are ordered
from a supplier of rec-
ords to most of the uni-
versities and colleges in
the Home Counties, who
collates all his orders and
buys the records to order
from a record dealer. In
this way, the records are
purchased new and in bet-
ter condition than one re-
ceives them from most re-
cord stores, at much less
than the full retail price.
There is no middle-man
making a fortune out of
the record-buying public,
just a group of students
who want to enable their
fellow students to listen to
the music of their own
choice with the minimum
of cost.
