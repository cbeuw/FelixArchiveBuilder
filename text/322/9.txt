CEFE says "Not a penny
more on the rents, not
a hall-worker less'9
There is an important issue fast approaching the
Union of this college and yet Mr. Seaford, the Domes-
tic Bursar, insists that the students and workers, whom
is could drastically affect, must not discuss it. Despite
his attitude many of the students in hall have heard
rumours about the hall fees being raised, and the
cleaners have heard rumours of sackings. This is the
way the College authorities would like it at the
moment, with these rumours spreading and without
anyone stepping back and taking an overall view. So
what better place tHan the "Opinion" column in
"Felix" to start some clear discussion on the matter.
What is the problem?
At the moment the Col-
lege authorities want to
keep the same level of
surplus from hall fees;
this is being used to keep
a profit to finance the
building of new halls.
There are two ways open
to them to do this, as
they look at it; these are
to raise hall fees or to
cut costs. The problem
arises when we see that
the students do not want
hall fees to go up and
the workers do not want
to lose their jobs as part
of the cost cutting.
What is happening now?
The r u m o u r s are
spreading, and both
groups of people directly
affected by this are dis-
cussing ways in which
they can minimise the
effects to themselves.
The college authorities
would like nothing better
than to see the students
and workers at odds over
this issue, each suggest-
ing that the alternative
which affects the others
worst is the one the au-
thorities should adopt.
The college authorities
would then step in and
suggest that both "sides"
should compromise. They
would like to see a few
less workers and only a
small rise in the fees.
They would then claim
that all were happy be-
cause a "reasonable solu-
tion" had been arrived
at. But in that case some
workers would have lost
jobs and students would
be paying more. It would
be only the college au-
thorities that would be in
any way happy. The only
reason that workers and
students might accept this
is that there is no other
alternative. The " College
authorities are now ac-
tively trying to put the
situation to students as a
straight choice.
Is there any alternative?
There is. This involves
both students and work-
ers identifying who are
going to be worse off
after this and who would
gain. Then to form a
strong worker-student al-
liance so that students
and workers fight on the
same side.
Then we would fight
from a position of
strength with no internal
divisions. Fight to keep
hall fees the same. Fight
to keep all the jobs there
are at present. Fight to
get the Department of
Education and Science
(through the University
Grants Committee) to pay
for all future hall build-
ing.
We must at no time be
put off by a statement
from college authorities
that "there would be no
redundancies". They still
have a system of natural
wastage where the jobs
of all cleaners who leave,
for any reason, are not
offered for replacements.
In a type of work with a
fairly rapid turnover of
labour this would allow
the authorities to reduce
the staff just as they like.-
We must fight to get the
authorities to keep the
same overall number of
jobs.
It is absolutely essen-
tial that this is discussed
by students and workers
now so that all the alter-
natives can be looked at.
This will avoid the situ-
ation which Mr. Seaford
would seem to like, when
he could bring a fait ac-
compli, a simple choice,
higher hall fees or less
workers.
Students and workers
must not be forced to
take any responsibility
for the running of the un-
iversity under the present
capitalist system. It is
neither the students nor
the workers who are going
to benefit from it. The
large monopolies and im-
portant industries who do
benefit is where the
money must come from.
We must decide now to
stop any action that is
going to be detrimental
to either workers or stu-
dents. This present
scheme would be detri-
mental to both. So we
must act as soon as pos-
sible to stop its imple-
mentation.
Christmas Fast
f ot*
World Justice
supported by World Development Movement, Third
World First, Oxfam, War on Want, etc.
This is a Nationwide Protest against the shameful
gulf that divides the "rich world" and "poor world".
Whether you guzzle or
glorify or both at Christ-
mas, it seems an appro-
priate time to bring home
the urgency of the prob-
lem of world poverty and
point out that it can be
tackled.
No one really wants
another person to starve
but most people seem to
believe that with the
amount of help Britain
gives, the poor nations
should now be able to
find their own solutions.
However, most develop-
ment economists realize
that the trade and in-
vestment policies of the
rich countries and big
companies exploit the
poor; that what we take
away in profits and
power from the Third
World outweighs what-
ever real value our aid
has: and that the poor
stay poor because they
cannot force concessions
as they have no power.
This fast is a step to-
wards creating the neces-
sary understanding and
determination to make
the injustice of world
poverty a live public is-
sue.
Fasts are being held in
28 different p l a c e s
throughout Britain and
in London alone there
will be five centres. Most
fasts fall between Decem-
ber 21 and December 25
with a 24-hour minimum
fasting period. During
this time tasters will be
leafleting, questionnairing
and publicising through
the media of street
theatres, workshops and
films with the aim of
generating widespread in-
terest and sympathy to
our point of view.
Fasts aren't new, but
this is the first time that
the determination, enthus-
iasm and concern which
exists over this issue in
many people throughout
the country will have been
gathered up in a con-
certed demonstration of
commitment and as such
should make a significant
impact. There has already
been some press coverage
and there will be lots
more.

In the land
of the Incas
TONIGHT — An ac-
count of the IC moun-
taineering expedition to
the Andes in Bolivia,
given by the leader of
the expedition Paul Bunt-
ing.
Last year several mem-
bers of the college moun-
taineering club were in-
terested in organising an
expedition. The area de-
cided upon was the COR-
DILLERA REAL, a
spectacular mountain
range, forming part of
the Andean chain in N.E.
Bolivia.
The situation of this
range is very interesting
as they form part of the
boundary between the
ALTIPLANO on the
east, a high plain of over
12,000 feet, and then on
the west the ground
slopes away massively
proportioned, heavily
wooded valleys to the
Amazon basin. It is on
the altiplano that the
Inca and pre-Inca cultures
flourished; on Lake Ti-
tiana, the large inland
lake on the plain, reed
boats of the Ra 2 type
are still used by the
Indians for fishing, and
it is here that the Indian
women all wear bowler
hats. In the valleys of the
mountains Indians also
live at altitudes up to
16,000 feet; they have to
adapt specially to the
lack of oxygen and the
intense cold at night. This
is the region of the llama
and the condor. Beyond
these valleys are the
snow - capped peaks
stretching up to 22,000
feet, as spectacular as
high mountains always
are.
It is against this back-
ground that the account
of the expedition is set;
the journey across Peru,
the living in La Paz, a
dust bowl scooped out
of the altiplano, waiting
for equipment Jo arrive,
the journey across the
plain, up through the
high valleys, and then,
using llamas jand local
porters, to base camp.
There was then a period
of climbing, an accident
in which two of the party
were killed, and our res-
cue attempt, and finally
the return, bringing us
eventually back to Lon-
don.
The,lecture, which will
be fully illustrated with
slides, is tonight (Tues-
day) at 7.30 in Room
303, RSM.

adventure. I expected him to be trotting on
ahead not disappearing in the rear.
"Oh, dear,. I do hope he's all right," said
the Twigworm, "I mean you've both been
so good to me and everything. This is all
my fault really, oh, I am sorry, I don't know
what to say . . ." He began to cry.
"Let's not start that again," pleaded
Ferocious, "It's not your jolly old fault, it's
just typical Phosphorous. He cannot keep
his mind on one thing for more than ten
minutes at a stretch. The dear boy will no
doubt re-emerge in the near future. I sug-
gest we—ah—press on, so to speak, and
hope for the best."
"Well, if you think it's all right," said
the Twigworm, "he is your friend, I sup-
pose."
"We all have our crosses to bear," said
Ferocious, and they trudged on along the
beach. They had not gone very far, when
the sound of music and laughter could be
heard, coming down the wind.
"As a change from this endless beach,"
said Ferocious, "I suggest we head for
these sounds of revelry." Reaching the top
of a large dune they could see the source
of the noise. Spread out beneath them was
a huge fair.
Gaily coloured tents covered an area the
size of Hyde Park, strange machines
whirled merry-makers up, down, round and
through. Mechanical music filled the air,
lights throbbed, whistles shrieked, men
shouted. It was very noisy indeed.
"Hum," said Ferocious.
"Oooooh!" said the Twigworm.
"That looks quite adventurous, does Jt
not, dear lad?" said Ferocious, "let us
mingle with the gay throng, and see what
occurs."
So down the side of the dune went Fero-
cious Din and the Tiny Twigworm. They
wandered amongst the tents and sideshows,
jostled by the crowds, pulled here and there
by stallholders, all their senses assaulted at
once. Unfortunately they had only 10p be-
tween them so they were unable to go on
any of the weird and exciting looking rides
and sideshows.
"With 10p we can have one go each
on one thing," said Ferocious, "what's it
going to b e ? "
"Oh, I couldn't possibly say," said the
Twigworm, "you decide for me."
" A difficult choice, so to speak," spoke
Ferocious, "I think the best solution is for
me to spin round with my eyes shut, and
then open them very suddenly. The attrac-
tion which first catches my eye will be the
one on which we will blow our tiny wealth."
The Twigworm did not seem to object, so-
Ferocious shut his eyes and spun round on
one leg. He fell immediately to the ground.
As he opened his eyes to examine his
injuries, he found he had come to rest at
the foot of a large sign.
"CREATURE FROM BEYOND MARS
DEFIES GRAVITY" it read, "Doctor Rab-
bit's amazing Invention defeats Laws of
Nature. See Space Being float on air. He
lives, he breathes. See him today—only 5p
a look."
"Not perhaps my first choice," said Fer- .
ocious, "but in we go." They paid their 5p
each to the little old man on the door and .
stepped inside the tent.
"Hello Ferocious, Hello Twigworm," said
Phosphorous the Jobrot.
