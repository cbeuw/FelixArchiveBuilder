Witches Edited by Carolyn Lloyd.
Armada, 20p.
The Witch! The Witch!
Don't let her get you!
Or your Aunt wouldn't know you
the next time she met you!
That there is no such thing as a
good witch is certainly very true in
this book. Carolyn Lloyd's collection
may not be very frightening to the
average grown-up but buy it for your
10-year-old cousin and see them glanc-
ing anxiously over their shoulder as
they climb the dark stairs to bed on
Christmas Eve.
Unfortunately, although I enjoyed
the stories and the poetry I did think
that the illustrations rather let the book
down; but it is still excellent cheap
Christmas present material.
The Wombles by Elizabeth Beresford.
Puffin, 25p.
Well, you get what you pay for, and
with 170 pages for 25p you can't ex-
pect too much in the story line from
the Wombles. They're a bit like teddy
bears, live under Wimbledon Common
and devote their lives to the constant
labour of keeping it tidy. "Womble life
has its ups and downs of course" and
that's where the story comes in.
An amusing and attractive series of
vaguely linked chapters take us through
the first working year of one Bungo
Womble. A safe and predictable exis-
tence it would appear. Whether such
a cosy line in fantasy will appeal to
those capable of reading it is the ques-
tion that may be rudely answered by
the children who get it for Christmas.
A Book of Goblins Edited by Alan
Garner. Puffin, 25p.
If witches are frightening then gob-
lins give me the absolute horrors . . .
Nasty, sinister, inexplicable crea-
tures rarely friendly, most often evil,
these are the people from myths and
legends from long ago who are collected
together here to produce fear and won-
der. These are the tales for the young-
ster (or even the adult) who wishes to
move out of the normal circle of read-
ing material, the person who wishes to
cloud even his pinkest of dreams.
Perhaps we have always tried to
reason with the unreasonable, the
natural forces around us and the psy-
chic forces within us, often we have
given them the Shape of animals, some-
times humans, very often ghosts. This
is why Goblins fascinate us.
Alan Garner doesn't provide the
answers, he only provides the ques-
tions — the ideas to worry about and
the pictures to help conjure them.
The Witch of Blackbird Pond by
Elizabeth George Speare. Puffin, 25p.
If this one gets serialised by the BBC
for Sunday children's hour, don't be
surprised. It's got all the essentials. A
setting in the repressive and intolerant
atmosphere of an early American puri-
tan settlement; a sixteen-year-old hero-
ine; a slow build up of hatred and hys-
teria; and finally a histrionic courtroom
climax, with, of coarse, a happy end-
ing.
All the anachronistic conflicts be-"
tween a sixteenth century society and
the typically liberal heroine are written
by an author completely lacking in
understanding for the record. Which
results in the usual antagonistic stero-
types of those judged by another con-
text.
Apart from that, Witch of Blackbird
Pond has little to offer except a nause-
ating dialogue of the "thank 'ee very
much masser Jim" variety. It says "par-
ticularly suitable for girls" on the cover.
One doesn't have to be a supporter of
women's lib to realise that tells us a
lot.

POETRy
Engineer's Love Poem to Miss C.
When double Polar integrals,
And all those things that so befall
This Engineer of Stress and Shear
All seem to be at once,
Not clear,
I just sit back, and what the Hell to
Squarish Triads and Unit Vector:
What care I now for Entropy,
When all I want
Begins with C?

he's got afinevoice too, while his broth-
er kept himself out of reach.
I was hoping they would play a few
more of their most recent material,
though they did play "Celluloid Heroes"
one of the best things they've done, and
little would please me more than to see
this as number one on "Top Of the
Pops."
During the interval an avalanche of
balloons was released from the back,
and were promptly burst, though one
maestro did have time to make a saus-
age dog before its destruction. As always
the Pink Panther cartoons helped to
pacify the audience during the wait after
the supporting band, Camel, who were
quite good, and deserved more than just
the polite aplpause that they received.
It was unfortunate that they should
suffer the problems of playing with a
super group.
G.J.K.
"Was it a good play, Bob?"
Ah, now there's the rub. Not, mind
you, "Was it a good play?", but "was
it a play?" I will admit to not being at
all sure, even now, as to what it was
that I saw at the Royal Court last
night, but for the record the name of
the piece is "A Sense of Detachment"
and it was written by John Osborne.
I suppose that it must have been
a play — for it occurred in the Royal
Court Theatre, a set of people whom
one would normally think of as the
"Cast" spoke lines that Mr. Osborne
had evidently written for them, and an-
other set of people, whom one would
normally think of as the "Audience"
watched them do so, having paid
heavily for the privilege. If there was a
plot (or even vague direction of pur-
pose), it is that thefirst-namedset of
people come together and "behave" in
front of the "Audience". Two of the
"Cast" never appear on stage, but are
planted in the "Audience", and if
they were there to act as a catalyst
for audience reaction, they failed mis-
erably.
There are however, certain very
bright spots in this abysmal business.
John Standing produces a very good
performance of whatever it is that he
is supposed to be performing, acting
with a well-paced ease. There are some
nice bits of business, notably danced
verse of "Widdicombe Fair" with the
names of contemporary playwrights
mockingly inserted, and a clever oppo-
The Day after the Fair (Lyric).
When I arrived in London last year,
the first play I saw was "Sleuth". I
thought it outstanding. Then came
"Canterbury Tales", "Company" and
"Fiddler on the Roof". I considered
them outstanding as well. After pin-
ning that same label on another half
dozen, I concluded "outstanding" was
in fact the adjective for West End
theatre. "Day after the Fair" does not
meet this standard.
The play centres in a 'nineties draw-
ing room, where a wealthy brewer
(Duncan Lamont) is immersed in busi-
ness affairs — trying to ruin his rival.
His wife of three years, Edith (Deborah
Kerr) was a peasant who he made a
lady. Having no children, he brings a
girl from her village, Anna (Julia Fos-
ter) to be her servant, and is busily
making a lady of her.
A fair comes to town where Anna
meets Charles (Paul Hastings), a Lon-
don barrister in town for the day.
Next day, - conveniently Anna's after-
noon off, they spend the afternoon in
a sheltered glade, culminating their
new-found friendship in the manner
one might well imagine.
A week later, a letter arrives from
London; alas, being able to neither read
nor write, Anna cannot comprehend
its contents. She cons Edith into doing
this for her. Edith undertakes this task
wih more than average zest, finding
herself more enamoured of Charles with
each letter.
Anna cannot see that. Although the
sister-in-law, Netty (Avice Landon)
thinks there's more than beer a-brew-
ing, 4he fails to make her brother
understand. He seems blithely uncon-
sition of pornographic film descriptions
and bouts of interspersed Romantic
Poetry. But these points shine despite,
and not because of, the general con-
tent.
So what was it (writes he rhetorically)?
"You're just a Device!" shouted one of
the cast at one of the audience im-
plantees. And that's what the whole
thing was — a set of Theatrical De-
vices.

cerned, although certain lines contradict
this impression: it would be better if
he didn't mumble so.
Now the clanger: Anna is pregnant
(surprise, surprise) so a big scene on
what to do. Write a letter, what else?
Charles, in love with the letter writer,
rushes out asking Anna to marry him.
Ths shocks Edith. She is now trapped;
she wishes to tell him she wrote the
letters, but doesn't wish to crush Anna,
who is elated.
Anna's smooth talk wins the day;
the wedding passes. At the reception,
Mr. Brewer-man only now meets
Charles, and on finding him a Lin-
coln's Inn lawyer, casually wonders
why he chose a girl who can't write.
There is silence as Charles realises he
has been (to put it mildly) deceived.
Perhaps because the play has now
been dragging on for over "
t
w
o hours;
perhaps because the script is bad,
Charles' confrontation with Anna and
Edith goes more smoothly and easily
than expected — he seems to be tak-
ing it all rather better than the aver-
age barrister — and the finish comes
rather quickly and is as unconvincing
as the cast's characteristics.
Perhaps it is too harsh to condemn
the play; there are good parts such as
the end of Act II, scene 2 and some
of Netty's lines. Day after the Fair is
not the best play in London, but then,
nor is it the worst. It makes a welcome
change from casual comedies, being one
of the four dramas currently running.
The play is worth the price of a bal-
cony seat, although one might want
to be nearer to hear the occasional soft-
spoken line.
