ANOTHER LETTER
I0HN LANE
Brand new, out-this-very-week, came the Tory White
Paper on education policy "Divide and Rule — Part
4". You will be hearing lots more about this but the
first point we have to note is that the increase in,
nursery education (welcome but still inadequate) will be
at the expense of further restrictions on higher educa-
tion spending, in addition to those already operating.
The College authorities will, of course, make gentle-
manly protests to the government and then will pro-
ceed to work within the (limits set. Student representa-
tives on committees will be pressurised into accepting
these limits "in the interests of future generations of
students" and asked to agree to rent rises, food price
increases, etc., instead of fighting them. The result
would be confusion in the union, no fights against the
Government cut-backs and the way left open to fur-
ther attacks.
A concrete example is
arising in this Union. Two
years ago I.C. Union, out
of the goodness of its
heart, agreed to a levy of
35p on top of the hall

On
Campaigns
Sir,—Once again Dowson
hits the nail right on the
thumb! Firstly John Lane is
not the first political presi-
dent that ICU has had for
several years; of the three
elected presidents up till
this year. Piers Corbyn,
Judith Walker and John Mc-
Culough, only the last was
non-political. Piers needing
no comment, and Judith
having been elected on a
Soc.Soc. platform. And in-
cidentally John Lane is a
Statistics postgraduate, one
would have thought that a
full-time editor could get
facts like that correct.
To go over to McBeath's
(sic) article on NUS confer-
ence, it should thirdly be
noted that there is not a
majority of Communist
Party members on NUS exec-
utive, there are exactly 3 out
of 15.
More importantly the
author betrays a vast ignor-
ance of the role NUS does
play amongst students, as
well as the role that the CP.
plays in NUS. To say that
CP. policies are adopted at
NUS conferences because of
clashes between a 'Commun-
ist' Executive (already com-
mented on) and extreme left
groups on the floor, is ludi-
crous and a slur on the dele-
gates who belong to neither
of these groups (i.e. the
majority; IC's delegation
consisted of one ultra-left
and five others, and doubt-
less other delegations were
much the same), the reason
why CP. policies are fre-
quently adopted is that they
reflecj. the needs of the stud-
ent body as a whole.
McBeath goes on to say
that the conference showed
lack of consideration for the
600,000 students NUS repre-
sents. Again this is rubbish,
if NUS were not considering
ali students then there would
be no campaigns at all on
grants,: housing, Union aut-
onomy, etc., instead the
standard of living of all stu-
dents would be allowed to
plummet, and Thatcher
would be able to run rough-
shod over the constituent
Unions, without any opposi-
tion. That would be true lack
of consideration. Here it
must be remembered that
Conference lays down the
broad outline for action by
NUS, it is up to the Execu-
tive to work out the details.
Thus conference called for a
rent strike to keep down Hall
fees, it is now the Execu-
tive's job to ensure that no
student suffers for imple-
menting this.
Mr. McBeath is correct to
say that there is a lack of
interest in NUS amongst a
large section of students —
and this article seems de-
liberately designed to rein-
force this lack of ipterest!
Of course NUS hasn't got
the economic power that
Trades Unions have, however
we must be prepared to use
what little we have, for ex-
ample in the form of rent
strikes which put pressure
on College Authorities and,
through them, on the Gov-
ernment. It must be remem-
bered that we are not stud-
ents for our own good, we
are students primarily be-
cause Industry needs highly-
trained people; and this too
gives us some strengths.
While we are students learn-
ing skills which industry will
later use to make large prof-
its for shareholders, we
should and must demand
grants that give us a decent
standard of living, and only
by combining our strengths
into one body can we hope to
win these rights — and that
body must be NUS. If the
action of students up and
down the country led by
NUS did not force the with-
drawal of the DES Green
Paper on Union Autonomy,
perhaps Mr. McBeath could
inform us what did. Certain-
ly Thatcher didn't withdraw
it out of the goodness of her
heart! It was student action
which forced her, and it
shows what can be done on
other issues if we try — and
try we must!
This particular issue dem-
onstrates another aspect of
the power of students —- and
that is their ability to win
support in specific cam-
paigns. The NUS mobilisa-
tion last year was able to
gain support from sections as
diverse as Vice Chancellors,
the Parliamentary Labour
Party and the National Union
of Mineworkers (the possibi-
lity of further Trade Union
support is potentially the
most valuable and reliable by
far). The key point is that
through united national ac-
tion, NUS got the Thatcher
proposals (temporarily) with-
drawn.
Finally McBeath's com-
parison of NUS with Parlia-
ment betrays an incredible
naivety. Does he believe
MPs really vote on 'con-
science' grounds? If so,
would he like to analyse the
thalidomide debate, or the
continued Tory support for
the bestial war in Vietnam?
And when he talks about the
"selection process that elim-
inates radical elements auto-
matically", one can only
assume from this that he
means left-wing (of any
shade) and excludes the
ultra-rightists of the Monday
Club, etc. To condemn NUS
for being more democratic
than Parliament is a weird
argument indeed.
On behalf of IC Commun-
is: Party Branch,
Yours hopefully,
PAUL WATKINS.
rents, to pay for now halls,
because rents were com-
paratively low. Since then
students' standards of liv-
ing have fallen drasti-
cally owing to inflation
and it is common for stu-
dents to spend two years
in bed-sits at £5-£6 a week
rents (or even higher),
which more than compen-
sates for one year in Hall
at a lower rent.
The College would like
us this time to increase the
levy. As well as this, when
the Northside Hall is fini-
shed, they will wanit an in-
crease in all rents to help
pay for it. A sub-com-
mittee is being set up
which Will deal with the
level of rents next year.
Our policy should be
quite clear. It should not
be the responsibility of
today's students to build
halls or refectories for
future students. This is the
responsibility Of society
as a whole and the money
should come from the rich
and the big monopolies,
who instead are getting
tax cuts (by the way, Dis-
tillers' Co. Ltd. Of thalido-
mide fame made "only"
£64,000,000 last year).
We must take no re-
sponsibility for doing the
dirty . work for the Tory
party and its industrial
backers. We must state
clearly that we will not
accept any rent rises with-
out a corresponding grant
increase.
Hall Cleaners
Rumours have been rife
that the college want to
reduce the number of
cleaners in halls. I have
ascertained that the Stu-
dent Hall Committee in-
cluding the wardens know
nothing of this. It is up
to us and the cleaners'
union, NUPE (National
Union Of Public Employ-
ees) to nip this in the bud.
This would be yet another
attack on students' living
standards and would we
get a rent reduction to
compensate? Not on your
life, it would go towards
letting the government off
the hook on paying for
new halls.
This is a clear-cut ex-
ample of how we can
work with trade unions to
defend each others' in-
terests.
Grants Campaign
NUS Conference laun-
ched a national grants
campaign with its main
points being a £65 in-
crease, an end to dis-
crimination against mar-
ried women and to discret-
ionary awards, no rent in-
creases and no refectory
price increases. Several
meetings in ithe next few
weeks will thrash out a
plan of campaign for next
term. But, meanwhile,
NUS regards the main
spring board for its cam-
paign as the rent strikes
already taking place all
over the country where
rents have increased or
the amount allowed for in
the grant, and which are
spreading rapidly even in-
to London where hall
rents are sometimes lower.
For example, LSE go on
rent strike next term.
The first UGM of next
term (Thursday 18th Jan-
uary) will discuss our
tactics for the grants cam-
paign including rent strike
refectory boycotts, demos,
etc.
In the meanwhile would
a,M students in hall please
wait until after the UGM
before paying the hall
bills. I will ensure that all
students in hall or house
get details of how rent
strike could operate at
the start of next term be-
fore any decision is taken.
Hope you all have a fine
Christmas and New Year,
but don't get drunk on
Distillers' stuff and have a
thought for all those poor
Scots fellow-students of
mine goinWi-ouchur dram
on Hogmanay!

MARTINS BIT
EE
Martin's Bit this week was to have reviewed the term
from my point of view. But it hasn't really been a
momentous term and will probably be remembered
chiefly as "the term of the elections". Now we have a
President and although his politics may not quite co-
incide with mine as a male chauvinist fascist pig I'm
sure that the Union as an entity will achieve some-
thing this year — but I'm not sure what.
eagonal <§xntiu0
Even though I don't actually support the event per-
sonally (you know what I mean, my boy) I'd like to
wish all my readers a Merry Christmas and a Happy
(and of course prosperous) New Year.
Naturally I don't give presents but if anybody feels
that it would spoil their Christmas if they were not to
give me one 1 will force myself to accept it (A Ghost
writer for Martin's Bit would be very useful).
1 suppose;—as a sop to the pseudo-politicians of the
NUS—that I should convince you that we must force
the Tories to resign, so here goes:
Wt must force ltj> Covits; to resign
Having done that, and returning ito a serious note,
please think about the Distillers' Company Limited's
attitude to the Thalidomide children, especially when
you're filling yourself With festive alcohol. I realise that
it's only a gesture but if enough people use Glen-
fiddich (check spelling Oily please) rather than Haig,
D.C.L. might notice (It's a much nicer whisky anyway).
on ®nton Jleetmgg
Many thanks for the idea of printing UGM minutes
in Felix. Provided our beloved sabbatical editor (I'm
glad someone loves me—Ed) can find the space (well
. . . you might twist my arm—Ed) I will gladly do so.
I'll also print the motions provided people supply them
in good time (IT! certainly print those—Ed).
on Vacations;
I will not be taking much of a vacation (ajl to-
gether now, ahhh!) but I hope that you all enjoy
yours; please don't disrupt the post too much.
I am looking forward to the birthday party on 3rd
January when the Union Bar is fifteen (only a few
months younger than me). I look forward to seeing you
there.
With Seasonal Goodwill, I remain (despite motions
of censure)
